1
00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:44.891
I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard.

2
00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:48.186
- You're Jerry Lundegaard?
- Yah.

3
00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:50.272
Shep Proudfoot said--

4
00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.649
Shep said you'd be here
at 7:30. What gives, man?

5
00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.276
Shep said 8:30.

6
00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:57.904
We've been here an hour.
He's peed three times already.

7
00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:02.743
Aw. I'm sure sorry. Shep told me
8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.

8
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.662
- You got the car?
- Yah, you bet.

9
00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.038
It's out in the lot there.

10
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.459
- Brand-new, burnt-umber Ciera.
- Yeah, OK. Well, sit down, then.

11
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:15.088
I'm Carl Showalter. This is my
associate, Gaear Grimsrud.

12
00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:16.715
Yah. How ya doin'?

13
00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.593
So, we all set on
this thing, then?

14
00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.261
Sure, Jerry. Why wouldn't we be?

15
00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:24.389
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are.
Shep vouched for you.

16
00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.516
I've got every confidence here
in you fellas.

17
00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.941
I guess that's it, then.
Here are the keys.

18
00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.401
No, that's not it, Jerry.

19
00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.946
- Huh?
- The new vehicle, plus $40,000.

20
00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.866
Yah, but the deal was
the car first,

21
00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.869
then the $40,000, like as if
it was the ransom.

22
00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.122
- I thought Shep told you.
- Shep didn't tell us much.

23
00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.624
Well, OK. It's--

24
00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.459
Except that you were gonna
be here at 7:30.

25
00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:55.462
- Yah, that was a mix-up.
- Yeah. You already said that.

26
00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:59.007
Yah. But it's not
a whole pay-in-advance deal.

27
00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:03.678
See, I give you a brand-new
vehicle in advance, and then--

28
00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:05.055
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

29
00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:06.348
OK.

30
00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:07.849
I'm not gonna sit here
and debate.

31
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.684
I will say this, though.

32
00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.770
What Shep told
us didn't make a lot of sense.

33
00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.232
Oh, no, it's real sound.
It's all worked out.

34
00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.859
You want your own
wife kidnapped?

35
00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:19.110
Yah.

36
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.030
You...

37
00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:27.077
My point is, you pay the ransom,
what, 80,000 bucks?

38
00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:30.330
I mean, you give us half the
ransom - 40,000. You keep half.

39
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.792
It's like robbin' Peter to
pay Paul. Makes no sense.

40
00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:37.087
OK. See, it's not me paying
the ransom.

41
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:40.131
The thing is, my wife,
she's wealthy.

42
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.800
Her dad, he's real well-off.

43
00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.260
Now, I'm in a bit of trouble.

44
00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.886
What kind of trouble
you in, Jerry?

45
00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:48.223
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

46
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.267
See, I just need the money.

47
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.644
Now, her dad,
he's real well-off.

48
00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.187
So why not just ask
him for the money?

49
00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:57.107
- Or your fucking wife.
- Or your fucking wife, Jerry.

50
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.191
Well...

51
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.861
It's all part of this...

52
00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:06.032
They don't know I need it, see.
OK, so there's that.

53
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.076
And even if they did,
I wouldn't get it.

54
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.744
So there's that on top, then.

55
00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.372
- These are personal matters.
- Personal matters?

56
00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:15.542
Yah. Personal matters
that needn't, uh...

57
00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:19.421
OK, Jerry. You're tasking us to
perform this mission,

58
00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:20.714
but you won't...

59
00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:22.632
You won't...

60
00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:27.012
Oh, fuck it.
Let's take a look at that Ciera.

61
00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:39.232
- Hon!
- Hi, hon. Welcome back.

62
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.736
- How was Fargo?
- Yah. Real good.

63
00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:45.864
- Dad's here.

64
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:53.079
- How ya doin', Wade?
- Yah. Pretty good.

65
00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.956
- What you watchin' there?
- Gophers.

66
00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.667
- Who they playin'?
- Oooh.

67
00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:09.262
- Is he stayin' for supper, then?
- Yah, I think so. Dad?

68
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.014
- What?
- You stayin' for supper?

69
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.223
Yeah.

70
00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.024
- May I be excused?
- What?

71
00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.485
- You done there?
Uh-huh. I'm going out.

72
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.613
- Where are you going?
- Just McDonald's.

73
00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.239
- Back at 9.30.
- OK.

74
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.909
He just ate. He didn't finish.

75
00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.578
He's going to McDonald's instead
of finishing here.

76
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.747
He sees his friends there.
It's OK.

77
00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.123
It's OK, McDonald's?

78
00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:41.169
What do you think they do there?
They don't drink milkshakes!

79
00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:42.462
It's OK, Dad.

80
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.304
Wade, have you had a chance
to think about

81
00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.390
um, that deal I was
talkin' about?

82
00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.600
Those 40 acres there on Wayzata?

83
00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:56.893
You told me about it.

84
00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:59.062
Yah. You said you'd have to
think about it.

85
00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.480
I understand it's
a lot of money.

86
00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:03.525
It's a heck of a lot.
What did you want to put there?

87
00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:06.027
- A lot. It's a limited...
- I know it's a lot.

88
00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:10.782
- I mean a parking lot.
- Yeah, well, $750,000 is a lot.

89
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.909
Yeah, well, it's a chunk, but...

90
00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:15.537
I had a couple lots, late 50's.
Lost a lot of money.

91
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:16.788
A lot of money.

92
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.039
Yah, but the difference...

93
00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.833
I thought you were gonna show
it to Stan Grossman?

94
00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.252
He passes on this stuff before
it gets kicked up to me.

95
00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:24.838
Stan'll say no dice.
That's why you pay him.

96
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.506
I'm askin' you here, Wade.

97
00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.135
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

98
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.888
Jean and Scotty
never have to worry.

99
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.572
Where is Pancake's House?

100
00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.659
- What?
- We stop at Pancake's House.

101
00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:58.872
You nuts?
We had pancakes for breakfast.

102
00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:02.292
I gotta go to a place where I
get a shot and a beer and steak.

103
00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.544
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

104
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.718
Oh, come on, man.

105
00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.013
OK, here's an idea.

106
00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:17.265
We can stop outside of Brainerd.

107
00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:19.350
I know a place there we can
get laid. What do you think?

108
00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.437
- I'm fuckin' hungry now.
- Yeah, yeah. Jesus.

109
00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:25.315
I'm saying we can stop,
get pancakes

110
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.858
and then we'll get laid.
All right?

111
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.541
We sat right here in this
room and went over this.

112
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.959
Yah, but that TruCoat...

113
00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.754
I sat right here and I said I
didn't want any TruCoat.

114
00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:49.923
Yah, but I'm saying,
that TruCoat,

115
00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.133
you don't get it, you get
oxidation problems...

116
00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.802
Cost you a heck of a lot
more than $500.

117
00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:56.137
You're sitting there
talking in circles

118
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.931
you're talkin' like we didn't go
over this already.

119
00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:01.434
- Yeah, but this TruCoat...
- We had a deal for $19,500.

120
00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.019
You sat there and darned if
you didn't tell me

121
00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:06.815
you'd get me this car without
the sealant for $19,500.

122
00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.441
All right, I'm not
saying I didn't.

123
00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:10.485
You called me twenty minutes ago
and said you had it.

124
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.488
"Ready to make delivery" you
says. "Come on down and get it."

125
00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.199
And here you are and you're
wasting my time

126
00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.575
and my wife's time.

127
00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.869
And I'm paying $19,500
for this vehicle here.

128
00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.372
All right.

129
00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.916
I'll talk to my boss.

130
00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.964
See, they install that TruCoat
at the factory.

131
00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:32.590
There's nothing we can do.

132
00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:33.800
But I'll talk to my boss.

133
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.929
These guys here. These guys.

134
00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.724
It's always the same.
It's always more.

135
00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.397
You going to the
Gophers on Sunday?

136
00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:48.523
Oh, you betcha.

137
00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.400
You wouldn't have
an extra ticket?

138
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:53.403
You kiddin'?

139
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:56.781
Well.

140
00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.119
He's never done this before,

141
00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.205
but seein' as it's special
circumstances an' all,

142
00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.875
he says I can knock $100
off that TruCoat.

143
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.044
One hundred?

144
00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:15.175
You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.
You're a bald-faced liar.

145
00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.384
Bucky, please.

146
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.512
A... fucking liar.

147
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:20.805
Bucky, please.

148
00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.143
Where's my goddamn checkbook?
Let's get this over with.

149
00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.062
Where is it?

150
00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:07.936
From Hollywood,
"The Tonight Show", star...

151
00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.439
I am talking about
your potential.

152
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.358
Mm-hm.

153
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.401
You're not a C student.

154
00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:16.945
Yeah.

155
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:19.155
Yet you're gettin' C grades.

156
00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.784
It's that disparity there
that concerns your dad and me.

157
00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:23.952
Uh-huh.

158
00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:26.788
- You know what a disparity is?
- Yeah!

159
00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:31.125
OK. Well, that's why we don't
want you goin' out for hockey.

160
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.004
Oh, man! Come on.
What's the big deal?

161
00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:37.298
- Hold on.

162
00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.717
- What's the big deal?
- Hello.

163
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.095
- Yeah, hi, hon.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

164
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:45.390
- Is Jerry around?
- Yah. Hon? Yah, he's here.

165
00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:46.557
I'll catch him for ya.

166
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.393
- Hon? It's Dad.
- OK.

167
00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.812
Look, Dad,
there's no fucking way...

168
00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:52.021
Scotty!

169
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.564
Hey, let's watch
that language there.

170
00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:56.609
- How ya doin' there, Wade?
- What's goin' on?

171
00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:59.237
Uh, nothin', Wade.
How ya doin' there?

172
00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:01.614
Stan Grossman looked
at your proposal.

173
00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:03.116
He says it's pretty sweet.

174
00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.993
- No kiddin'?
- Might be interested.

175
00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:09.706
No kiddin'? I'd need the cash
pretty quick there,

176
00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.249
in order to close the deal.

177
00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.334
Come by at 2:30.
We'll talk about it.

178
00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:16.212
If your numbers are right,
Stan says it's sweet.

179
00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.214
- Stan, you know, Grossman.
- Yah.

180
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:20.341
- 2:30.
- Yah. OK.

181
00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.691
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?

182
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.319
Say, you know those two fellas

183
00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.029
you put me in touch
with up there in Fargo?

184
00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:42.488
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.

185
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.782
Well, he had a buddy
there. He...

186
00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.035
- I don't vouch for him.
- That's OK.

187
00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:48.536
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

188
00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.455
Uh, Carl something.

189
00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.457
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

190
00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:55.543
He's a buddy of the
guy you vouch for,

191
00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:56.753
so I'm not worrying.

192
00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.380
I'm just wondering, see...
I gotta get in touch with him.

193
00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:03.384
See, this deal I needed 'em for,
I may not need it any more.

194
00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.720
- Something's happenin', see.
- Call him up.

195
00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:09.140
I did that, and I haven't been
able to get him.

196
00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:11.559
So I thought maybe you'd know
an alternate number.

197
00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.145
- Nope.
- OK.

198
00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:16.314
Well, real good, then.

199
00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.503
Can you crack
a fuckin' window open, man?

200
00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:44.175
You know, it's proven second-
hand smoke is a carcino...

201
00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.469
You know, a cancer agent.

202
00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.390
Look at that... Twin Cities.

203
00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:52.934
That's the IDS building,
the big glass one.

204
00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.560
The tallest skyscraper
in the Midwest,

205
00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:57.730
after the, uh, Sears in Chicago,

206
00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:00.024
or John Hancock Building,
whatever.

207
00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:02.235
Have you ever been
to Minneapolis?

208
00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.570
Nope.

209
00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:08.825
Would it kill you
to say something?

210
00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.787
- I did.
"No"?

211
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.498
That's the first thing you've
said in the last four hours.

212
00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.794
That's a... that's a fountain
of conversation, man.

213
00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:21.838
That's a geyser.

214
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.757
I mean, whoa, daddy.
Stand back, man.

215
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:27.718
Shit.

216
00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:31.347
I'm sittin' here drivin'-
I'm doin' all the drivin',

217
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:33.349
whole fuckin' way from
Brainerd, drivin',

218
00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.853
just tryin' to chat, you know,

219
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.439
keep our spirits up, fight the
boredom of the road,

220
00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:41.107
and you can't say
one fuckin' thing

221
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.567
just in the way of conversation?

222
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.405
Oh, fuck it. I don't have to
talk either, man.

223
00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:49.407
See how you like it.

224
00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.538
Just total fuckin' silence.

225
00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.707
Two can play at
that game, smart guy.

226
00:15:58.416 --> 00:15:59.792
We'll just see how you like it.

227
00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:04.380
Total silence.

228
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.595
Mr. Lundegaard, this is
Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC.

229
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:11.762
How are you this morning?

230
00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.181
Real good. How you doin'?

231
00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:16.184
Good. You're damn hard to
get on the phone.

232
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.187
Yah, it's pretty darn busy here,
but that's the way we like it.

233
00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:20.438
That's for sure.

234
00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:24.692
Now, I just need, on these last
financing documents you sent us,

235
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.736
I can't read the serial numbers
of the vehicles.

236
00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.697
Yah, but it's OK.
The loans are in place.

237
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.449
I already got the...
the... What?

238
00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:34.410
$320,000. You got the
money last month.

239
00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:35.912
Yah. So we're all set, then.

240
00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:38.414
Yes, but the vehicles
you're borrowing on,

241
00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:42.168
I can't read the serial
numbers. If you...

242
00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.504
But the deal's already done.
I got the money.

243
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.214
Yes. We have an audit here.

244
00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:48.466
I just have to know that these
vehicles you're financing

245
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:50.468
with this money, that
they really exist.

246
00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:54.138
- Yah, they exist all right.
- Well, I'm sure they do.

247
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.474
But I can't read
the serial numbers,

248
00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:57.934
so if you could read me...

249
00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.937
Yah, but, see...

250
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:04.524
I don't have 'em in front of me.
Why don't I fax you over a copy?

251
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.275
Fax is no good.

252
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.319
That's what I have, and I
can't read the darn thing...

253
00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:11.197
Yah, OK. I'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.

254
00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:14.408
OK. Because if I can't correlate
this note with the vehicles,

255
00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.369
I call back that money.

256
00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:19.455
- Yah. How much money was that?
- $320,000.

257
00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.207
I gotta correlate that money

258
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.708
with the cars
it's being lent on.

259
00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:24.085
OK. No problem.

260
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.586
- I'll fax that over...
- No, no. Fax is...

261
00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:26.963
I mean send it over.

262
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.714
- I'll shoot it over to you.
- OK, fine.

263
00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.424
OK. Real good, then.

264
00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:39.225
- We're with Katie Carlson.
- Hi.

265
00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:42.395
Now, we just want to remind
all of our viewers at home

266
00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.605
that this March, for the second
year in a row,

267
00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.816
Katie and I,
along with Twin City Travel,

268
00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:49.694
will be leading
a two-week trip down the Nile.

269
00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.654
It's a terrific time. I know
you've heard about it.

270
00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.532
We want all of you to come with.

271
00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.284
And that's the truth.

272
00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.330
OK, for those who've just joined
us, Katie is gonna show us...

273
00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.541
- ..how to make Holidazzle eggs

274
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:04.959
ourselves at home.

275
00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:06.877
- Now, Katie, I gotta admit.
- What?

276
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:09.547
I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.

277
00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:11.632
This is an empty egg.

278
00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:13.050
That's right, Dale.

279
00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:14.760
There was an egg in here, right?

280
00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:17.513
- Yeah.
- OK, well, how do you...

281
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.058
You don't have an empty chicken
somewhere that lays empty eggs?

282
00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:24.854
No, no. I guarantee this was
an honest-to-goodness Grade A...

283
00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:36.073
Argh!

284
00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:42.163
- Unguent.
- What?

285
00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.540
I need unguent.

286
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.540
- Am I doin" it?
- Push it.

287
00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:31.420
Shit.

288
00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.653
Argh!

289
00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:03.869
Argh!

290
00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:27.685
How're you, Stan?

291
00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.062
- How ya doin', Wade?
- Good to see you again, Jerry.

292
00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:33.232
If the numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

293
00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:35.192
Oh, those numbers
are right, all right.

294
00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:37.027
- Believe me.
- This is doable.

295
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:40.740
- Congratulations, Jer.
- Thanks, Stan. It's a pretty...

296
00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:43.033
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

297
00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:45.453
Huh?

298
00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:47.413
The financials are
pretty thorough,

299
00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:50.082
so the only thing we don't
know is your fee.

300
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.254
My fee? Wade, what the heck
are you talkin' about?

301
00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:57.506
- Stan and I are OK.
- Yah.

302
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.508
- We're good to load in.
- Yah.

303
00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:03.721
But we never talked about
your fee for bringing it to us.

304
00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:06.432
No, Wade, I was
bringing you this deal

305
00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:08.017
for you to loan me the
money to put in.

306
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.518
It's my deal here, see.

307
00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:14.148
We thought you were
bringing us an investment.

308
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:15.524
Yah. Right.

309
00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:18.986
You're sayin'...
What are you sayin'?

310
00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:20.696
You're saying we
put in all the money

311
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.324
and you collect
when it pays off.

312
00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:29.079
No, no, see, but I'd pay you
back the principal and interest.

313
00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:33.459
- Heck, I'd go one over prime.
- We're not a bank, Jerry.

314
00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:35.795
If I wanted bank interest
on $750,000,

315
00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:38.589
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to Bill Diehl.

316
00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:40.299
- He's at Norstar.
- He's at...

317
00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:44.762
No, no. But, see,
I don't need a finder's fee.

318
00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:45.888
I need...

319
00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:48.808
Finder's fee's, what, 10%?

320
00:21:48.891 --> 00:21:51.644
Heck, that's not gonna do
it for me. I need the principal.

321
00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:54.939
We're not gonna
just give you $750,000.

322
00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:56.357
What the heck were you thinking?

323
00:21:56.482 --> 00:21:57.775
If I'm only getting bank
interest,

324
00:21:57.858 --> 00:22:00.361
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

325
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:01.946
I don't see nothing
like that here.

326
00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:04.114
Yeah, but I... I...

327
00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:09.537
OK. I'd... I'd guarantee you
your money back.

328
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.832
I'm not talking about
your damn word, Jerry.

329
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:15.543
- Jeez, what the heck are you...
- We're not a bank, Jerry.

330
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.921
Well, look, I don't wanna
cut you out of the loop,

331
00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:20.464
but this here's a good deal.

332
00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:23.759
I assume if
you're not interested,

333
00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:25.678
you won't mind if we move on it.

334
00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:27.596
Independently.

335
00:23:28.282 --> 00:23:30.618
Dammit! Dammit!

336
00:24:00.898 --> 00:24:01.899
Hon?

337
00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:05.945
Got the groceries.

338
00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:45.818
Yah, Wade, it's Jerry.

339
00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:51.824
Wade, it's Jerry. I don't know
what to do. It's Jean.

340
00:24:52.616 --> 00:24:54.368
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

341
00:24:55.285 --> 00:24:56.954
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

342
00:24:59.665 --> 00:25:02.418
Yeah, Wade,
it's Jerry. I...

343
00:25:05.129 --> 00:25:07.923
Wade, it's Jerry. I...
We gotta talk.

344
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.801
It's somethin'...
Aw, jeez, it's terrible.

345
00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:20.477
- Yes?
- Uh, uh...

346
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.438
Yeah. Wade Gustafson, please.

347
00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:00.851
Shut the fuck up,

348
00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:03.604
or I'll throw you
back into the trunk, you know.

349
00:26:04.354 --> 00:26:06.482
Jeez, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

350
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.450
Ah, shit.

351
00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:20.496
Oh, the tags.

352
00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:30.089
All right, it's just the tags.
I never put my tags on the car.

353
00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:34.468
Don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

354
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.663
Keep it still back there, lady,
or else we're gonna have to,

355
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.581
you know, shoot ya.

356
00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:14.675
Hey, I'll take care of this.

357
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.533
How can I help you, Officer?

358
00:27:50.127 --> 00:27:51.628
This a new car, then, sir?

359
00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:54.840
Certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

360
00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:58.510
You're required to display
temporary tags,

361
00:27:58.594 --> 00:28:01.305
either in the plate area
or taped to the back window.

362
00:28:01.388 --> 00:28:02.431
Certainly.

363
00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:04.725
Can I see your
license and registration?

364
00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:05.893
Certainly.

365
00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:11.899
Yeah, I was
gonna tape up the tag,

366
00:28:12.482 --> 00:28:14.234
you know,
to be in full compliance,

367
00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:16.445
but, uh, it must've, uh...

368
00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:18.322
It must've slipped my mind.

369
00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:21.575
So maybe the best thing to do

370
00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:23.702
would be to take care of
that right here in Brainerd.

371
00:28:25.954 --> 00:28:29.833
- What's this, sir?
- My license and registration.

372
00:28:31.293 --> 00:28:32.920
Yeah, I wanna be in compliance.

373
00:28:35.589 --> 00:28:37.341
I was just thinking we could
take care of it

374
00:28:37.424 --> 00:28:39.259
right here, in Brainerd.

375
00:28:45.641 --> 00:28:47.643
Put that back in your pocket,
please.

376
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:50.979
And step out of the car,
please, sir.

377
00:29:15.545 --> 00:29:16.964
Shut the fuck up!

378
00:29:34.731 --> 00:29:35.816
Whoa.

379
00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:39.111
Whoa, daddy.

380
00:29:41.697 --> 00:29:43.782
You'll take care of it.

381
00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:50.247
You are smooth smooth, you know.

382
00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:53.500
Oh, daddy.

383
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:57.296
Just clear him off the road.

384
00:29:58.797 --> 00:29:59.965
Yeah.

385
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:52.697
Oh, jeez.

386
00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.288
Hi, it's Marge.

387
00:34:02.249 --> 00:34:03.583
Oh, my. Where?

388
00:34:04.626 --> 00:34:05.710
Yah.

389
00:34:07.212 --> 00:34:08.463
Aw, jeez.

390
00:34:10.674 --> 00:34:12.092
OK, there in a jiff.

391
00:34:13.218 --> 00:34:14.302
Real good, then.

392
00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:21.851
OK.

393
00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:25.188
You can sleep. It's early yet.

394
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:28.191
- Gotta go?
- Yeah.

395
00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:30.902
I'll fix you some eggs.

396
00:34:31.695 --> 00:34:33.780
That's OK, hon. I gotta run.

397
00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:35.865
You gotta eat a
breakfast, Marge.

398
00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:39.703
I'll fix you some eggs.

399
00:34:41.246 --> 00:34:42.998
Oh, hon, you can sleep.

400
00:34:43.415 --> 00:34:45.500
You gotta eat a breakfast.

401
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:50.797
I'll fix you some eggs.

402
00:34:51.464 --> 00:34:53.133
Ah, Norm.

403
00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:02.434
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.

404
00:35:02.809 --> 00:35:05.103
- Love you, Margie.
- Love you, hon.

405
00:35:38.553 --> 00:35:40.597
- Hon.
- Yah?

406
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.390
Prowler needs a jump.

407
00:36:02.118 --> 00:36:03.495
Hiya, Lou.

408
00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:06.915
Whoo! What ya got there?

409
00:36:07.457 --> 00:36:10.377
Margie, thought you might
need a little warm-up.

410
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.586
Thanks a bunch.

411
00:36:12.212 --> 00:36:14.756
What's the deal?
Gary says triple homicide.

412
00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:17.467
Yah. Looks pretty bad.
Two of 'em are over here.

413
00:36:18.218 --> 00:36:20.595
- Where is everybody?
Well...

414
00:36:21.346 --> 00:36:22.889
It's cold, Margie.

415
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:26.601
Watch your step, Margie.

416
00:36:36.695 --> 00:36:38.613
Aw, jeez. So...

417
00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:40.740
Aw, jeez.

418
00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:42.701
Here's the second one!

419
00:36:44.077 --> 00:36:46.955
It's in the head and
the hand there.

420
00:36:48.623 --> 00:36:50.375
I guess that's a
defensive wound.

421
00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:51.584
Oh, yah?

422
00:36:52.752 --> 00:36:54.504
Where's the state trooper?

423
00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:57.966
Back there a good piece, in
the ditch next to his prowler.

424
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:00.093
OK.

425
00:37:00.927 --> 00:37:03.138
So we got a trooper
pulls someone over,

426
00:37:03.972 --> 00:37:06.725
we got a shooting,
these folks drive by,

427
00:37:06.808 --> 00:37:08.810
there's a high-speed pursuit,

428
00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:11.563
ends here, and then this
execution-type deal.

429
00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:12.647
Yah.

430
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:17.277
I'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from Brainerd.

431
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:18.611
Yah.

432
00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:21.656
And I'll tell you what.

433
00:37:22.157 --> 00:37:24.617
From his footprint,
he looks like a big fella.

434
00:37:28.538 --> 00:37:30.290
You see something down
there, Chief?

435
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:33.752
No, I just think I'm gonna barf.

436
00:37:34.461 --> 00:37:35.462
Jeez.

437
00:37:36.629 --> 00:37:38.965
- You OK, Margie?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

438
00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:43.678
It's just morning sickness.

439
00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:48.975
- Well, that passed.
- Yah?

440
00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:50.643
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.

441
00:37:51.603 --> 00:37:53.271
You had breakfast yet, Margie?

442
00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:54.731
Oh, yah.

443
00:37:55.648 --> 00:37:57.901
- Norm made some eggs.
- Yah?

444
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.028
Well...

445
00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:02.572
What now, do you think?

446
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.700
Let's go take a look
at that trooper.

447
00:38:08.745 --> 00:38:10.580
There's different footprints
here, Lou.

448
00:38:10.663 --> 00:38:11.664
Yah?

449
00:38:11.748 --> 00:38:13.917
Yah. This guy's
smaller than his buddy.

450
00:38:14.167 --> 00:38:15.418
Oh, yah?

451
00:38:16.795 --> 00:38:19.464
- For Pete's sake.
- How's it look, Marge?

452
00:38:20.048 --> 00:38:22.133
Well, he's got his gun
on his hip there,

453
00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:24.886
and he looks like a
nice enough guy.

454
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.431
- It's a real shame.
- Yah.

455
00:38:31.684 --> 00:38:33.561
Didn't monkey with his
car there, did ya?

456
00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:34.729
No way.

457
00:38:34.813 --> 00:38:36.356
Somebody shut his lights.

458
00:38:36.523 --> 00:38:39.150
Guess the little guy sat in
there waiting for his buddy.

459
00:38:39.234 --> 00:38:40.902
Yah. Would've
been cold out here.

460
00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:42.070
Heck, yah.

461
00:38:42.362 --> 00:38:44.739
- Ya think, is Dave open yet?
- Dave?

462
00:38:45.865 --> 00:38:47.742
You think he's mixed up in this?

463
00:38:47.826 --> 00:38:50.328
Oh, no. I just wanna get Norm
some night crawlers.

464
00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:55.542
Did you look in his
citation book?

465
00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:56.876
Yah.

466
00:38:57.001 --> 00:39:00.797
Last vehicle he wrote in was a
tan Ciera at 2:18am.

467
00:39:01.381 --> 00:39:03.299
Under plate number he put DLR.

468
00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:05.343
I figure they stopped him
or shot him

469
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.095
before he could finish filling
out the tag number.

470
00:39:07.387 --> 00:39:08.388
Uh-huh.

471
00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:10.139
So I got the state
looking for a Ciera

472
00:39:10.223 --> 00:39:13.101
with a tag startin' DLR.
They don't got no match yet.

473
00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:16.980
I'm not sure that I
agree with you

474
00:39:17.063 --> 00:39:18.773
100% on your police
work there, Lou.

475
00:39:19.107 --> 00:39:20.608
- Yah?
- Yah.

476
00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:24.153
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

477
00:39:25.113 --> 00:39:26.406
DLR.

478
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.784
Oh.

479
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:32.704
Jeez.

480
00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:37.083
Lou, d'you hear the
one about the guy

481
00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:38.835
who couldn't afford
personalized plates,

482
00:39:38.918 --> 00:39:42.338
so he went and
changed his name to J3L24047

483
00:39:43.172 --> 00:39:44.799
Yah, that's a good one.

484
00:39:52.265 --> 00:39:54.267
Look, all's I know

485
00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:56.144
is you got a problem,
you call a professional.

486
00:39:56.311 --> 00:40:00.106
No. They said no cops. They were
darn clear on that, Wade.

487
00:40:00.189 --> 00:40:02.066
They said "You call your cops,
we're gonna shoot..."

488
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:03.318
Of course, they'll say that.

489
00:40:03.693 --> 00:40:05.486
Where's my protection?
They got Jean.

490
00:40:05.904 --> 00:40:07.780
If I give these sons of bitches
a million dollars

491
00:40:07.864 --> 00:40:09.741
where's my guarantee
they'll let her go?

492
00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:10.867
- Well, they...
- A million dollars

493
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.160
is a lot of damn money.

494
00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:14.954
- They got my daughter.
- Think this thing through.

495
00:40:15.038 --> 00:40:17.832
You give ‘em what they want,
why won't they let her go?

496
00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:20.835
You gotta listen to me
on this one, Wade.

497
00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:24.631
Heck, you don't know. You're
just whistling Dixie here.

498
00:40:25.131 --> 00:40:28.718
The cops can advise us on this.
I'm saying call a professional.

499
00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:30.386
No. No cops!

500
00:40:31.346 --> 00:40:34.307
That's final.
This is my deal here, Wade.

501
00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:36.809
- Yeah...
- Jean is my wife here.

502
00:40:37.143 --> 00:40:39.896
I gotta tell you, Wade, I'm
leaning to Jerry's viewpoint.

503
00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:42.982
- Well...
- We gotta protect Jean. These...

504
00:40:43.483 --> 00:40:44.984
We're not holding any cards.

505
00:40:45.568 --> 00:40:47.153
They got 'em all,
so they call the shots.

506
00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:49.697
- You're darned tootin'.
- Oh, dammit.

507
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:53.159
- I'm tellin' ya.
- Well, why don't we...

508
00:40:54.077 --> 00:40:56.621
Stan, I'm thinking we should
offer 'em half a million.

509
00:40:57.038 --> 00:41:00.667
Now, come on here!
No way, Wade. No way.

510
00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:02.585
We're not horse-tradin'
here, Wade.

511
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:03.711
Yeah.

512
00:41:03.836 --> 00:41:05.338
We gotta just bite the
bullet on this thing.

513
00:41:05.421 --> 00:41:06.589
Yeah.

514
00:41:08.007 --> 00:41:10.885
So, uh, what's the next step
here, Jerry?

515
00:41:11.177 --> 00:41:13.513
They're gonna call me
with instructions for a drop

516
00:41:13.638 --> 00:41:16.224
- I need the money by tomorrow.
- Dammit!

517
00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:22.355
- How was everything today?
- Yah. Real good now.

518
00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:25.775
How you doin'?

519
00:41:26.776 --> 00:41:29.904
OK. Now, we'll
get the money together.

520
00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:31.739
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

521
00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:35.910
Now, do you want anyone at home
with you till they call?

522
00:41:36.411 --> 00:41:39.622
No, Il... They were just supposed
to be dealing with me.

523
00:41:39.789 --> 00:41:40.999
They were real clear.

524
00:41:41.207 --> 00:41:43.001
You know, they said
no one listening in.

525
00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:45.003
They'll be watchin', you know.

526
00:41:45.211 --> 00:41:46.254
Maybe it's all bull,

527
00:41:46.379 --> 00:41:48.756
but, like you said,
Stan, they're callin' the shots.

528
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:50.133
OK.

529
00:41:50.675 --> 00:41:53.261
Now, is Scotty gonna
be all right?

530
00:41:55.013 --> 00:41:57.056
Yah. Jeez, Scotty.

531
00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.143
- Yah. I'll go talk to him.

532
00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:16.659
How ya doin' there, Scotty?

533
00:42:17.702 --> 00:42:18.870
Dad.

534
00:42:19.912 --> 00:42:21.414
What are they doin'?

535
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:24.125
What do you think they're
doin' with Mom?

536
00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:25.585
It's OK, Scotty.

537
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.879
They're not gonna
wanna hurt her any.

538
00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:30.256
These men,
they just want money.

539
00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:33.760
What if something
goes wrong, Dad?

540
00:42:33.843 --> 00:42:36.888
No, no, no. Nothing's
going wrong here.

541
00:42:37.096 --> 00:42:41.184
Granddad and I, we're making
sure this gets handled right.

542
00:42:41.976 --> 00:42:44.187
I really think we should
call the cops.

543
00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:47.273
No, no. No one can know
about this thing.

544
00:42:48.191 --> 00:42:50.026
We gotta play ball with
these guys.

545
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:52.361
Ask Stan Grossman, he'll
tell ya the same thing.

546
00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:53.529
But, Dad...

547
00:42:53.696 --> 00:42:55.031
We're gonna get
Mom back for ya,

548
00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:57.825
but we gotta play ball,
you know.

549
00:42:59.952 --> 00:43:01.329
That's the deal here.

550
00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:08.711
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

551
00:43:08.795 --> 00:43:12.340
you just say Mom's down in
Florida with Pearl and Marty.

552
00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.887
That's the best we can do here.

553
00:44:02.557 --> 00:44:03.933
No!

554
00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.570
Agh!

555
00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:22.910
Whoops!

556
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.727
Thanks, Myra.

557
00:44:49.896 --> 00:44:51.147
- Mornin'.
- Carol.

558
00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:54.901
Oh, Janie, two more
of those Skin-So-Softs, please.

559
00:44:56.652 --> 00:44:57.945
Hiya, hon.

560
00:44:58.196 --> 00:44:59.614
I brought you some
lunch, Margie.

561
00:45:01.032 --> 00:45:03.117
- What are those, night crawlers?
- Yah.

562
00:45:03.492 --> 00:45:06.704
- Aw, thanks, hon.
- You bet. Thanks for lunch.

563
00:45:07.038 --> 00:45:08.873
Oh, yah, looks pretty good.

564
00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:12.210
- What have we got here? Arby's?
- Uh-huh.

565
00:45:12.335 --> 00:45:14.462
- How's the paintin' goin'?
- Pretty good.

566
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:18.507
Found out the Hautmans are
entering a painting this year.

567
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:20.468
Aw, hon, you're
better than them.

568
00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:22.345
They're real good.

569
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:25.181
They're good, Norm.
But you're better.

570
00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:26.474
Ah.

571
00:45:27.058 --> 00:45:28.267
You think so?

572
00:45:30.102 --> 00:45:32.146
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

573
00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:36.901
Hey, Norm. How's the
paintin' goin'?

574
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:38.361
Not too bad, you know.

575
00:45:38.736 --> 00:45:39.946
How we doin' on that vehicle?

576
00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:42.615
No motels registered a
Ciera last night.

577
00:45:42.782 --> 00:45:46.035
But the night before,
two men checked into the Blue Ox

578
00:45:46.118 --> 00:45:48.871
registering a Ciera
and leaving the tag space blank.

579
00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:51.415
- Jeez, that's a good lead.
- Yah.

580
00:45:52.041 --> 00:45:54.210
Blue Ox, that's that truckers'
joint on 1-35?

581
00:45:54.335 --> 00:45:55.378
Yah.

582
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.714
Owner was on the desk then.
Said these two had company.

583
00:45:59.173 --> 00:46:01.300
- Oh, yah?
- Yah.

584
00:46:05.346 --> 00:46:07.723
We both did.
She went to college, too.

585
00:46:07.807 --> 00:46:09.892
I went to Normandale
for about a year and a half.

586
00:46:10.017 --> 00:46:11.978
- Yah, that's where we met.
- I dropped out.

587
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:13.896
- Yah, she dropped.
- Yah.

588
00:46:14.522 --> 00:46:16.983
- So where are you girls from?
- Chaska.

589
00:46:17.066 --> 00:46:20.278
Le Sueur, but I went to high
school in White Bear Lake.

590
00:46:20.528 --> 00:46:21.779
Go, Bears.

591
00:46:22.405 --> 00:46:25.950
OK. I want you to tell me
what these fellas look like.

592
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.244
Well, the little guy was
kinda funny-lookin'.

593
00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:29.495
In what way?

594
00:46:29.704 --> 00:46:30.913
I don't know.
Just funny-lookin'.

595
00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.291
Can you be any more specific?

596
00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:36.752
I couldn't really say.
He wasn't circumcised.

597
00:46:38.045 --> 00:46:40.006
Was he funny-lookin'
apart from that?

598
00:46:40.715 --> 00:46:41.757
Yah.

599
00:46:42.967 --> 00:46:46.595
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then?

600
00:46:47.096 --> 00:46:48.180
Uh-huh.

601
00:46:48.556 --> 00:46:50.349
Anything else you can
say about him?

602
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:53.060
No. Like I say,
he was funny-lookin'.

603
00:46:53.436 --> 00:46:54.854
More than most people, even.

604
00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:57.982
- What about the other fella?
- He was older.

605
00:46:58.065 --> 00:46:59.567
He looked like the
Marlboro Man.

606
00:46:59.692 --> 00:47:00.735
Oh, yah?

607
00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:02.695
Yah. But maybe
I'm saying that

608
00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:04.447
cos he smoked a
lot of Marlboros.

609
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:05.573
Uh-huh.

610
00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.241
Like a subconscious
type of thing.

611
00:47:07.325 --> 00:47:09.452
- Oh, yah, that can happen.
- Yah.

612
00:47:09.952 --> 00:47:11.620
Hey, they were goin'
to the Twin Cities.

613
00:47:11.704 --> 00:47:12.747
Oh, yah?

614
00:47:12.955 --> 00:47:14.832
Yah. Yah. Is that useful to ya?

615
00:47:14.957 --> 00:47:16.584
Oh, you betcha, yah.

616
00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:17.793
Yah.

617
00:47:20.129 --> 00:47:23.674
- Come on! Goddammit!

618
00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:27.511
Jesus Christ.

619
00:47:28.471 --> 00:47:31.390
Come on, you fucking shit box.

620
00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:34.226
Been here for days.

621
00:47:35.144 --> 00:47:37.188
Goddammit, nothin' to do.

622
00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:40.358
Fucking TV doesn't even...

623
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.696
Dammit, come on! Plug me in,
man. Give me a fucking signal.

624
00:47:48.616 --> 00:47:50.201
Goddammit!

625
00:47:52.578 --> 00:47:54.246
Unbelievable. Come on.

626
00:47:55.039 --> 00:47:56.082
God...

627
00:47:56.999 --> 00:47:58.250
Fuck!

628
00:47:58.459 --> 00:48:01.295
Come on, plug me into the
ozone, baby. Come on.

629
00:48:03.047 --> 00:48:04.131
Come on!

630
00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:08.135
Fuck. Fuck.

631
00:48:08.761 --> 00:48:10.805
Fuck! Fuck!

632
00:48:17.103 --> 00:48:19.647
The bark beetle
carries the worm to its nest,

633
00:48:21.774 --> 00:48:24.235
where it will feed its young
for up to six months.

634
00:48:27.655 --> 00:48:30.950
In the spring, the larvae hatch
and the cycle begins again.

635
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.243
Well.

636
00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.037
I'm turning in, Norm.

637
00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:37.081
Oh, yeah?

638
00:48:40.209 --> 00:48:42.837
Here it is throwing
off the larval envelope.

639
00:48:56.517 --> 00:48:59.437
- Hello.
- Yah, is this Marge?

640
00:48:59.895 --> 00:49:02.314
- Yah.
- Margie Olmstead?

641
00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.943
Yah. Who's this?

642
00:49:06.277 --> 00:49:08.279
This is Mike Yanagita!

643
00:49:08.362 --> 00:49:10.823
You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?

644
00:49:12.324 --> 00:49:15.119
M...
Mike Yanagita?

645
00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:16.370
Yah!

646
00:49:16.912 --> 00:49:19.248
Well, yah.

647
00:49:19.707 --> 00:49:22.793
Course I remember you.
How are ya doin'?

648
00:49:22.877 --> 00:49:25.087
- What time is it?
- Oh, jeez,

649
00:49:25.212 --> 00:49:26.630
It's a quarter to eleven.

650
00:49:26.755 --> 00:49:30.634
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- No. That's OK.

651
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:33.220
Yah, I'm down in
the Twin Cities.

652
00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:36.223
I was watching on TV about
these shootings in Brainerd,

653
00:49:36.307 --> 00:49:38.184
- and I saw you on the news.
- Yah.

654
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:41.645
I thought "Jeez, is that Margie
Olmstead? I can't believe it."

655
00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:44.023
Yah. That's me.

656
00:49:44.732 --> 00:49:46.400
Well, how the heck are ya?

657
00:49:46.484 --> 00:49:49.612
OK, you know. OK.

658
00:49:49.695 --> 00:49:51.489
- Yah?
- Yah.

659
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:54.950
- How are you doin'?
- Oh, pretty good.

660
00:49:56.202 --> 00:50:00.331
Aw, heck. It's been
such a long time, Mike.

661
00:50:01.373 --> 00:50:02.833
It's great to hear from ya.

662
00:50:06.504 --> 00:50:08.506
Yah, you got your, um...

663
00:50:08.756 --> 00:50:11.759
This is loaded here. This
has your independent...

664
00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:14.970
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

665
00:50:15.054 --> 00:50:18.140
antilock brakes, alarm, radar.

666
00:50:18.599 --> 00:50:21.143
And I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

667
00:50:21.227 --> 00:50:22.478
This TruCoat stuff,

668
00:50:22.603 --> 00:50:25.356
- it'll keep the salt off.
- I don't need no sealant.

669
00:50:25.439 --> 00:50:26.690
Yah, you don't need that.

670
00:50:27.399 --> 00:50:29.151
Were you thinking
of financing here?

671
00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:32.863
You gotta be aware of this GMAC
plan they have now. It's super.

672
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.491
- Call for you, Jerry.
- Yeah, OK.

673
00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:43.874
Jerry Lundegaard.

674
00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:45.668
Jerry, got the
phone to yourself?

675
00:50:46.168 --> 00:50:48.295
- Well, yah.
- You know who this is?

676
00:50:48.379 --> 00:50:52.216
Well, yah. I got an idea. How's
that Ciera workin' out for ya?

677
00:50:52.299 --> 00:50:54.093
Circumstances have
changed, Jerry.

678
00:50:54.677 --> 00:50:57.513
Well... what do you mean?

679
00:50:57.596 --> 00:50:58.764
Things have changed.

680
00:50:58.931 --> 00:51:02.309
Circumstances beyond the...
Acts of God, force majeure.

681
00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:04.645
What the... How's Jean?

682
00:51:06.647 --> 00:51:09.567
- Who's Jean?
- My wife. What the...

683
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:10.985
She's all right,

684
00:51:11.193 --> 00:51:13.487
but there's three people in
Brainerd who aren't OK.

685
00:51:13.654 --> 00:51:16.198
What are you talking about?
Let's finish this deal here.

686
00:51:16.282 --> 00:51:17.950
Blood has been shed, Jerry.

687
00:51:19.243 --> 00:51:22.371
- What the heck do you mean?
- Three people in Brainerd.

688
00:51:22.454 --> 00:51:23.539
Oh, jeez.

689
00:51:23.664 --> 00:51:25.624
That's right.
And we need more money.

690
00:51:25.708 --> 00:51:28.877
What are you talkin' about?
What have you got mixed up in?

691
00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:32.172
- We need more money...
- This was a no-rough-stuff deal.

692
00:51:32.256 --> 00:51:34.925
Don't ever interrupt me, Jerry.
Just shut the fuck up!

693
00:51:35.009 --> 00:51:36.760
Well, I'm sorry, but I just...

694
00:51:36.844 --> 00:51:39.346
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate.

695
00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:40.973
We now want the entire $80,000.

696
00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:42.891
Oh, for Chrissake here.

697
00:51:42.975 --> 00:51:45.644
Blood's been shed.
We've incurred risks.

698
00:51:45.728 --> 00:51:47.771
I'm coming to town tomorrow
for the money.

699
00:51:47.855 --> 00:51:50.399
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

700
00:51:50.524 --> 00:51:51.525
Is it, Jerry?

701
00:51:51.609 --> 00:51:53.902
Ask those three poor souls up in
Brainerd if a deal's a deal.

702
00:51:53.986 --> 00:51:55.029
Ask ‘em!

703
00:51:55.112 --> 00:51:56.196
The heck do you mean?

704
00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.490
"Heck d'you mean?"
See you tomorrow.

705
00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:04.872
- Yah.
- Jerome Lundegaard?

706
00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:07.082
- Yah.
- This is Reilly Diefenbach

707
00:52:07.166 --> 00:52:10.502
at GMAC. Sir, I've not received
those vehicle IDs.

708
00:52:10.836 --> 00:52:13.756
Yah. I... Those are in the mail.

709
00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:15.507
That may be.

710
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:18.552
However, absent the receipt of
those numbers

711
00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:19.678
by tomorrow afternoon,

712
00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:22.139
I'll have to refer this matter
to our legal department.

713
00:52:22.264 --> 00:52:24.350
- Yah.
- My patience is at an end.

714
00:52:24.433 --> 00:52:25.851
- Yah.
- Good day, sir.

715
00:52:25.934 --> 00:52:27.144
Yah.

716
00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:28.038
Hi, Norm. How ya doin', Margie?

717
00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:29.957
How's the fricassee?

718
00:53:30.124 --> 00:53:31.750
Pretty darn good.
You want some?

719
00:53:31.834 --> 00:53:33.836
Oh, no. I got... Hey, Norm.

720
00:53:33.919 --> 00:53:36.004
I thought you was goin' ice
fishing up at Mille Lacs.

721
00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:39.633
- Yah. After lunch.
- Ah.

722
00:53:40.134 --> 00:53:42.678
- What you got there?
- Oh. The numbers you asked for.

723
00:53:43.637 --> 00:53:46.140
Calls made from the lobby
phone at the Blue Ox.

724
00:53:46.515 --> 00:53:47.933
Two to Minneapolis that night.

725
00:53:48.642 --> 00:53:50.227
First one's a trucking company,

726
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.730
second's a private residence.
A Shep Proudfoot.

727
00:53:53.564 --> 00:53:55.441
Uh-huh. A what?

728
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:57.985
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.

729
00:53:58.610 --> 00:53:59.903
- Uh-huh.
- Yah.

730
00:54:01.488 --> 00:54:02.740
OK. Yah.

731
00:54:04.366 --> 00:54:05.909
Think I'll take a drive down
there, then.

732
00:54:05.993 --> 00:54:07.745
Oh, yah? Twin Cities?

733
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:12.124
Oh, yah?

734
00:54:26.138 --> 00:54:28.182
Dammit, I wanna be a
part of this thing.

735
00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:31.518
No. Wade, they were clear.

736
00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:33.312
They said they'd call tomorrow
with instructions,

737
00:54:33.479 --> 00:54:35.314
and it's gotta be
delivered by me alone.

738
00:54:35.606 --> 00:54:37.441
It's my money. I'll deliver it.

739
00:54:38.066 --> 00:54:40.694
- What do they care?
- Wade's got a point there.

740
00:54:40.778 --> 00:54:42.696
I'll handle the call if
you want, Jerry.

741
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:45.532
No, no. See, they
only deal with me.

742
00:54:46.408 --> 00:54:49.787
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

743
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:52.581
They're very...
These guys are dangerous.

744
00:54:52.664 --> 00:54:54.416
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

745
00:54:55.167 --> 00:54:57.669
With all due respect, I don't
want you mucking this up.

746
00:54:58.128 --> 00:54:59.171
What the heck do you mean?

747
00:54:59.296 --> 00:55:00.881
They want my money,
they deal with me,

748
00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:04.426
or I go to a professional.
There's a million dollars here!

749
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:05.928
- No, see...
- Look Jerry,

750
00:55:06.053 --> 00:55:07.930
you're not selling me
a damn car!

751
00:55:08.222 --> 00:55:10.724
It's my show here. That's that.

752
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:14.353
It's the way we prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

753
00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:23.445
Hi. How ya doin'?

754
00:55:23.529 --> 00:55:25.489
Real good. How you
doin' today, ma'am?

755
00:55:25.697 --> 00:55:27.658
I'm doing really super
there, thanks.

756
00:55:27.741 --> 00:55:29.952
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

757
00:55:31.662 --> 00:55:33.705
Yup, you sure do,
Mrs. Gunderson.

758
00:55:34.373 --> 00:55:36.333
Is there a phone down
here, ya think?

759
00:55:39.086 --> 00:55:40.295
Detective Sibert?

760
00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:43.882
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

761
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.344
Yeah, well, actually
I'm in town here.

762
00:55:47.636 --> 00:55:49.721
I had to do a few things
in the Twin Cities,

763
00:55:49.805 --> 00:55:51.515
so I thought I'd check
in with ya

764
00:55:51.598 --> 00:55:54.184
about that USFI search
on Shep Proudfoot.

765
00:55:55.769 --> 00:55:56.937
Oh, yah?

766
00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:59.898
Well, maybe I'll go visit
with him if I have a...

767
00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:03.110
No, I can find that.

768
00:56:04.111 --> 00:56:06.613
Yah, well, thanks a bunch.
Oh, say, say.

769
00:56:07.155 --> 00:56:08.407
Would you happen to know

770
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:10.576
a good place
for lunch in the downtown area?

771
00:56:11.994 --> 00:56:13.120
The Radisson.

772
00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:16.123
Oh, yah. Is it reasonable?

773
00:57:33.909 --> 00:57:35.410
Hi. How ya doin'?

774
00:57:35.911 --> 00:57:37.663
Yeah. I decided
not to park here.

775
00:57:38.747 --> 00:57:41.041
What do you mean? You decided
not to park here?

776
00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:43.919
Yeah, I just came in. I decided
not to park here, so...

777
00:57:44.002 --> 00:57:46.463
But... Well, I'm sorry, sir...

778
00:57:46.588 --> 00:57:48.757
Yeah, I decided
not to... I, uh...

779
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:53.053
I'm not... I decided not to take
the trip, as it turns out.

780
00:57:53.512 --> 00:57:56.348
Well, I'm sorry, sir. We've
still gotta charge you the $4.

781
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.311
I just pulled in here.
I just fucking pulled in here.

782
00:58:01.395 --> 00:58:05.065
Well, but, see,
there's a minimum charge of $4.

783
00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:07.359
Long-term parking
charges by the day.

784
00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:15.325
I guess you think you're like
an authority figure,

785
00:58:15.909 --> 00:58:17.619
with that stupid
fucking uniform?

786
00:58:18.495 --> 00:58:20.914
King clip-on tie there.
Big fucking man, huh?

787
00:58:21.873 --> 00:58:23.917
These are the
limits of your life, man.

788
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.627
Ruler of your little
fucking gate.

789
00:58:25.711 --> 00:58:28.839
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

790
00:58:31.091 --> 00:58:33.510
- Where's Shep?
- Talking to a cop.

791
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:37.431
- Cop?
- Said she was a cop.

792
00:58:40.267 --> 00:58:42.519
Do you remember getting a call
Wednesday night?

793
00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:44.312
Nope.

794
00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:48.025
You do reside there at
1425 Freemont Terrace?

795
00:58:48.108 --> 00:58:49.192
Yup.

796
00:58:49.526 --> 00:58:52.195
- Anyone else residing there?
- No.

797
00:58:52.863 --> 00:58:54.114
Well, Mr. Proudfoot,

798
00:58:54.322 --> 00:58:56.491
this call came
in past three in the morning.

799
00:58:56.908 --> 00:58:58.035
It's just hard for me to believe

800
00:58:58.118 --> 00:58:59.786
you don't remember
anyone calling.

801
00:59:01.163 --> 00:59:03.540
Now, I know you've
had some problems.

802
00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:05.500
Struggling with the narcotics,

803
00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:08.503
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

804
00:59:09.004 --> 00:59:10.047
So?

805
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:11.715
Well, associating
with criminals,

806
00:59:11.882 --> 00:59:13.300
if you're the one
they talked to,

807
00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:16.094
that right there would be a
violation of your parole.

808
00:59:16.344 --> 00:59:18.346
Would end you up
back in Stillwater.

809
00:59:19.097 --> 00:59:21.391
I saw some rough
stuff on your priors,

810
00:59:21.516 --> 00:59:22.934
but nothing like a homicide.

811
00:59:23.018 --> 00:59:24.936
I know you don't wanna be
an accessory

812
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.146
to something like that.

813
00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:30.358
So, you think you might remember

814
00:59:30.484 --> 00:59:32.027
who those folks
were who called ya?

815
00:59:41.995 --> 00:59:43.997
- Mr. Lundegaard?
- Huh, yeah.

816
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:45.916
Could I take a minute
of your time here?

817
00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:47.918
What... what is it all about?

818
00:59:48.794 --> 00:59:51.004
D'you mind if I sit down?
Carrying quite a load here.

819
00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.757
You're the owner here,
Mr. Lundegaard?

820
00:59:54.174 --> 00:59:56.259
No, Il... Executive
sales manager.

821
00:59:56.343 --> 00:59:58.553
You can help me.
My name is Marge Gunderson.

822
00:59:58.637 --> 00:59:59.930
My father-in-law is the owner.

823
01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:01.640
Uh-huh.

824
01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:03.433
Well, I'm a police officer

825
01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.602
from up Brainerd investigating
some malfeasance.

826
01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:08.396
I was wondering if
you'd had any vehicles

827
01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:10.315
stolen off the lot in the
past couple of weeks.

828
01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:14.861
Specifically,
a tan-colored Ciera.

829
01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:20.575
Mr. Lundegaard?

830
01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:24.579
Brainerd?

831
01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:29.209
Yah, yah. Home of Paul Bunyan,
Babe the Blue Ox.

832
01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.128
Babe the Blue Ox.

833
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:37.759
Yeah, you know,
we got that big statue up there.

834
01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:44.432
So, you haven't had any vehicles
go missing, then?

835
01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.393
No. No, ma'am.

836
01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:48.603
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch.

837
01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:50.689
I'll let you get back to
your paperwork, then.

838
01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:08.290
- Yah, get me Shep.
- He's not here right now.

839
01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.458
- What the heck d'you mean?
- He stepped out.

840
01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.044
- Where did he go?
- I'll get you Arty.

841
01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:15.589
No, I don't need a mechanic.
I need a, uh...

842
01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:18.049
Uh...

843
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.137
Aw, jeez. I gotta talk
to a friend of his.

844
01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:26.850
So, um... have him, um...

845
01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:30.228
- What?
- Aw, jeez.

846
01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.250
Mike?

847
01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:54.419
Marge?

848
01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.380
Jeez!

849
01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:00.091
- Oh, you look great.
- Yeah, so do you.

850
01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:03.386
Oh, easy there, easy there.
Easy there, easy there.

851
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.139
You do, too. I'm expecting.

852
01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.391
Oh, I see that. That's great.

853
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:12.062
- Oh, what can I get ya?
- Oh, just a Diet Coke, please.

854
01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:13.730
- OK.
- Great.

855
01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.650
- This is a nice place.
- Yah.

856
01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:20.612
You know, it's a Radisson,
so it's pretty good. Yah.

857
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.368
So...

858
01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.620
You're living in
Edina, then?

859
01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.747
Yah, yah, yah. A couple
of years now.

860
01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:34.042
It's actually Eden Prairie,
that school district.

861
01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:37.295
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

862
01:02:37.879 --> 01:02:40.257
So, you married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

863
01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:43.593
- Oh, yah. Long time ago.
- Great. Great.

864
01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:46.680
So, uh, what brings you down...

865
01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:48.723
Are you down here
on that homicide,

866
01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:50.976
if you're allowed
to discuss that?

867
01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:54.688
Oh, yah, yah. But there's not
a heck of a lot to discuss.

868
01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.315
OK.

869
01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:01.236
Well, what about you, Mike?
Are you married? You got kids?

870
01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.280
Yah, yah. Well...

871
01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.700
I was married.
I was married to...

872
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.785
You mind if I sit over here?

873
01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.829
I was married to Linda Cooksey.

874
01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:13.081
No, why not sit over there?
I prefer that.

875
01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:16.167
Huh? Oh. Oh. Uh...

876
01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:18.211
OK.

877
01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:22.090
Sorry.

878
01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:23.967
Oh, no, no.
Just so I can see ya.

879
01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:27.053
- Don't have to turn my neck.
- Oh, sure, sure. I understand.

880
01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:31.516
- I didn't mean to...
- No, no.

881
01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:33.685
That's fine.

882
01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:37.814
Yah. Sorry. Uh, sorry.

883
01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:41.693
So, I was married to
Linda Cooksey.

884
01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:44.154
You remember her. She
was a year behind us.

885
01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:48.241
Yeah, I think I remember her.
Yeah. She... Oh, yeah, yeah.

886
01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.201
So it didn't work out, huh?

887
01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:54.164
And then I've been working for
Honeywell for a few years now.

888
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:55.665
Oh, well, they're a good outfit.

889
01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.251
If you're an engineer,
you can do worse.

890
01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:02.756
But it's not, uh... It's nothing
like your achievement.

891
01:04:03.381 --> 01:04:05.300
Oh, well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

892
01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:09.637
It's not that things
didn't work out.

893
01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:11.389
It's, uh... uh...

894
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.352
Linda had leukemia, you know.

895
01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:18.146
She was a... She passed away.

896
01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:19.773
No!

897
01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:24.235
- It was tough.
- There you go.

898
01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:26.738
It was long, uh...

899
01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:30.533
She fought real hard, Marge.

900
01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.413
What can you say?

901
01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:40.502
Oh. Better times, huh?

902
01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:41.878
Better times.

903
01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:47.592
Oh, and then I saw ya on the TV

904
01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:50.804
and I remembered, you know,
I always liked you.

905
01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:54.516
- Well, I always liked you, Mike.
- I always liked you so much.

906
01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:01.481
So, Mike, should we
get together another time?

907
01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.274
No! I... I...

908
01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.656
I'm sorry. It's...

909
01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:11.282
I shouldn't have done this.

910
01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.368
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

911
01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:16.204
I thought we'd have a
really terrific time.

912
01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:17.705
It's OK, Mike.

913
01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:19.666
You were such a super lady.

914
01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:23.211
And then... I've been so lonely.

915
01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:27.924
It's OK, Mike.

916
01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:35.682
Here's a song

917
01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:37.600
I'd like to dedicate to all the
ladies out here tonight.

918
01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:40.395
It goes like this.

919
01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:56.244
So, are you from around here?

920
01:05:57.912 --> 01:05:59.330
Just in town on business.

921
01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:01.458
Just in and out.

922
01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:05.795
Just a little of the old
"in and out."

923
01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:09.132
What do you do?

924
01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.009
Uh... Uh...

925
01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:16.806
Um, have you been to
the Celebrity Room before

926
01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:19.142
with other, uh, clients?

927
01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.895
I don't think so. It's nice.

928
01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:24.606
Yeah, well, it
depends on the artist.

929
01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:27.567
You know, José Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

930
01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:30.028
Waiter.

931
01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:33.156
Is he deaf?

932
01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:38.536
So, uh, how long you work for
the escort service?

933
01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:40.830
I don't know. A few months.

934
01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.250
Find that work
interesting, do you?

935
01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.545
What are you talkin' about?

936
01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:49.839
All right.

937
01:06:50.215 --> 01:06:52.592
Come on. I'm hearing bells.

938
01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.636
Come on, huh?

939
01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.639
All right. Where were ya?

940
01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.641
Huh? Huh?

941
01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:04.938
Shep, what the hell you doin'?
I'm bangin' that girl. Ow!

942
01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:09.901
Fucking asshole!
Get the fuck outta here!

943
01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:13.196
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little fucking shithead.

944
01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:15.031
Get the fuck outta here!

945
01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:17.534
Yo!
Cut that shit out, man.

946
01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.619
I'm trying to get some
goddamn sleep here.

947
01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:23.164
- Come on, brother.
- Fuck you.

948
01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:32.173
- Fuck you.
- Argh! Animals!

949
01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:35.885
- Animals! Animals!
- Stay away from me, man.

950
01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:37.762
Hey, smoke a fucking peace pipe!

951
01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:40.056
Wait! Don't you dare
fucking hit me!

952
01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:48.940
Fucking little weasel.

953
01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.775
- Fuck you, man.
- Ow! Stop it!

954
01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:54.988
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

955
01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.576
Jesus Christ! You fucking
shitbag motherfucker!

956
01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:03.413
Yah?

957
01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:05.331
Alright Jerry, I'm through
fucking around.

958
01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:08.251
- You got the fucking money?
- Yah, I got the money, but...

959
01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.128
Don't you fucking
"but" me, Jerry!

960
01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:12.755
I want you with this money at
the Radisson parking ramp,

961
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.299
top level, 30 minutes,

962
01:08:14.382 --> 01:08:16.426
- and we wrap this thing up.
- OK, but, um...

963
01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.469
You're there in 30 minutes or
I find you, Jerry,

964
01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:21.514
I shoot you, your fucking wife
and all your children.

965
01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:23.683
And I shoot 'em in the
back of their heads, you got it?

966
01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.685
OK now, you stay
away from Scotty now.

967
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:28.271
- Got it?
- OK. Real good, then.

968
01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:54.464
Dad?

969
01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:57.675
- It's OK, Scotty.
- Where you goin'?

970
01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.553
I'll be back in a minute.

971
01:09:01.512 --> 01:09:05.183
If Stan calls, you just tell him
I went to Embers.

972
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.647
OK. Here's your damn money.

973
01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.025
Now where's my daughter?

974
01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:16.194
You...

975
01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:19.697
You goddamn punk!

976
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:37.090
Who the fuck are you?

977
01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:42.053
Who the fuck are you?!

978
01:09:42.512 --> 01:09:44.639
I've got your damn money.
Where's my daughter?

979
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.602
I am through fucking around.
Drop that fucking briefcase!

980
01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:53.564
- Where's my daughter?
- Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry?

981
01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.900
I gave simple
fucking instructions!

982
01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:59.570
Where's my damn daughter?
No Jean, no money.

983
01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:03.199
- Drop that fucking money!
- No Jean, no money!

984
01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:06.661
Is this a fucking joke here?

985
01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.503
Oh...

986
01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:16.879
jeez.

987
01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:20.550
You happy now, asshole?
What's with you people?

988
01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.844
You fucking imbeciles.

989
01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:32.687
You fucking shot me!

990
01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:42.196
Aaaargh!

991
01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:51.682
May I have your ticket, please?

992
01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:53.726
Open the fucking gate!

993
01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:34.725
Oh, jeez.

994
01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:07.091
- Dad?
- Yah?

995
01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:09.135
Stan Grossman called.

996
01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:11.929
- Yeah, OK.
- Twice.

997
01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:13.347
OK.

998
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.809
Is... is everything OK?

999
01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:18.352
Yah.

1000
01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:21.856
Are you callin' Stan?

1001
01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.068
Well, I'm...

1002
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.738
I'm going to bed now.

1003
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.235
- How ya doin'?
- Mr. Mohra?

1004
01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:10.196
- Yah.
- Officer Olson.

1005
01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.031
Yah. Righto.

1006
01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:15.618
Well, so I'm tendin' bar
down there

1007
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.912
at Ecklund and Swedlin's
last Tuesday.

1008
01:14:18.245 --> 01:14:19.497
This little guy's drinkin'

1009
01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:21.457
and he says "Where can
a guy find some action?"

1010
01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:23.584
"I'm goin' crazy out
there at the lake.”

1011
01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:25.461
I says, "What kind of action?"

1012
01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:27.713
He says, "Woman action.
What do I look like?"

1013
01:14:27.838 --> 01:14:29.298
And I says
"What do I look like?

1014
01:14:29.423 --> 01:14:31.258
I don't arrange
that kind of thing."

1015
01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:34.053
He says "I'm goin'
crazy at the lake."

1016
01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.681
And I says "But this ain't
that kind of place.”

1017
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:38.975
He says "Oh, I get it.

1018
01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:40.768
So you think I'm a
jerk for askin?"

1019
01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:44.271
Only he don't use the word
"jerk." Then he calls me a jerk.

1020
01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:46.607
Says the last guy who thought
he was a jerk is dead now,

1021
01:14:46.774 --> 01:14:48.359
so I don't say nothin'.

1022
01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.236
He says "What d'you think
about that?"

1023
01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:53.823
I says "Don't sound like a
good deal for him."

1024
01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:55.032
- You got that right!
- Yeah.

1025
01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:58.369
Says "Guy's dead,
and not of old age."

1026
01:14:58.536 --> 01:15:01.622
Then he says "Jeez, I'm goin'
crazy out there at the lake."

1027
01:15:01.872 --> 01:15:04.291
- White Bear Lake?
- Ecklund and Swedlin

1028
01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:07.503
that's closer to Moose Lake,
so I made that assumption.

1029
01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:09.380
Anyway, he's drinkin'
at the bar,

1030
01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.507
so I don't think a
great deal of it.

1031
01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:14.802
But Mrs. Mohra heard about
the homicides down here

1032
01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:16.303
and thought I should call it in,

1033
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:18.848
so... I called it in.

1034
01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:22.018
End of story.

1035
01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.021
What did this guy
look like, anyways?

1036
01:15:25.146 --> 01:15:27.940
Oh, he's a little guy,
kinda funny-lookin'.

1037
01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:29.817
Uh-huh. In what way?

1038
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.028
Oh, justin a
general kind of way.

1039
01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:35.114
OK, thanks a bunch Mr. Mohra.

1040
01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:36.824
You're right, it's
probably nothin',

1041
01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:38.993
- but thanks for callin' her in.
- Sure.

1042
01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:42.246
Looks like she's gonna
turn cold tomorrow.

1043
01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:44.582
Oh, yah. Got a front comin' in.

1044
01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.792
Yah, you got that right.

1045
01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:07.855
Jesus Christ.

1046
01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:28.037
Valeria, I'm leavin' this
morning, back up to Brainerd.

1047
01:18:28.162 --> 01:18:29.580
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.

1048
01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.582
Mm. But you think
he's all right?

1049
01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:34.084
- I saw him last night and...
- What did he say?

1050
01:18:34.418 --> 01:18:36.128
It's nothing specific he said.

1051
01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:38.088
It just seemed like it all hit
him really hard,

1052
01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:39.256
his wife dyin',

1053
01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.133
- His wife?
- Linda.

1054
01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:42.885
- Who?
- Linda Cooksey.

1055
01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:45.221
No. No, no, they weren't...

1056
01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:48.182
He was bothering Linda for
over a year,

1057
01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:50.184
really pestering her.
Wouldn't leave her alone.

1058
01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:52.561
So...

1059
01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:55.981
He didn't... They never...

1060
01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:58.317
No. No, they never married.

1061
01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:00.069
Mike's had psychiatric problems.

1062
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.404
Oh, my.

1063
01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:05.532
Yah. He's been struggling. He's
living with his parents now.

1064
01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:08.786
Oh, jeez.

1065
01:19:08.953 --> 01:19:10.996
Linda's fine.
You should call her.

1066
01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.416
Jeez. Well... jeez.

1067
01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:17.962
That's a surprise.

1068
01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:29.348
Hello?

1069
01:20:10.097 --> 01:20:13.309
Mr. Lundegaard. Sorry to
bother you again. Can I come in?

1070
01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:16.437
Yah. No, I'm kinda...
I'm kinda busy here.

1071
01:20:16.687 --> 01:20:18.647
I understand.
I'll keep it real short, then.

1072
01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:21.650
I'm on my way outta town,
but I was wondering...

1073
01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:24.069
Mind if I sit down?
Carryin' a bit of a load here.

1074
01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:25.237
No. I...

1075
01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:28.615
It's this vehicle I asked you
about. I was wondering...

1076
01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:31.577
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't
had any vehicles go missing.

1077
01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:34.121
OK. Are ya sure?

1078
01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.582
Cos, I mean, how do you know?

1079
01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:40.461
The crime I'm investigating, the
perpetrators were driving a car

1080
01:20:40.627 --> 01:20:42.588
with dealer plates and called
someone who works here,

1081
01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.340
so it would be quite a
coincidence if they weren't,

1082
01:20:44.423 --> 01:20:46.133
you know, connected.

1083
01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:49.345
- Yah, I see.
- So how do you...

1084
01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.889
Have you done
any kind of inventory recently?

1085
01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:53.849
The car's not from
our lot, ma'am.

1086
01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:55.851
How can you be sure
without doin' a...

1087
01:20:56.143 --> 01:20:57.644
Well, I would know.

1088
01:20:58.062 --> 01:20:59.605
I'm the executive sales manager.

1089
01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:01.440
Yah, but I understand...

1090
01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:03.108
We run a pretty tight ship here.

1091
01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:06.070
I know, but how
do they establish that?

1092
01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:09.490
Are the cars counted daily,
or what kind of a routine here?

1093
01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:12.159
Ma'am! I answered your question.

1094
01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.331
I'm sorry, sir?

1095
01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:19.166
Ma'am, I answered
your question.

1096
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:22.920
I answered the darn... I'm
cooperating here,

1097
01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:25.130
and there's no...

1098
01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:31.595
Sir, you have no call to
get snippy with me.

1099
01:21:31.678 --> 01:21:34.098
- I'm just doing my job here.
- I'm...

1100
01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:39.144
I'm not... I'm not arguin' here.

1101
01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.940
I'm cooperating and there's
no... We're doin" all we can.

1102
01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:53.242
Sir, could I talk to
Mr. Gustafson?

1103
01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:58.831
Mr. Lundegaard.

1104
01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:05.337
Well, heck! If you wanna...
if you wanna play games here...

1105
01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:07.798
I'm workin' with ya
on this thing here, but...

1106
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:11.385
OK, I'll do a damn lot count.

1107
01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:14.138
- Sir, right now?
- Yah, right now.

1108
01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.056
You're darned tootin'.

1109
01:22:17.224 --> 01:22:20.352
If it's so damned
important to ya.

1110
01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:22.688
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

1111
01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.857
Ah, what the Christ. Jesus!

1112
01:23:08.442 --> 01:23:10.861
Oh, for Pete's sake.

1113
01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:17.367
For Pete's sake,
he's fleein' the interview.

1114
01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:18.702
He's fleein' the interview!

1115
01:23:20.954 --> 01:23:22.664
How do I get an
outside line here?

1116
01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:24.458
Uh...

1117
01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:26.752
Great.

1118
01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:31.423
Yah, Detective Sibert, please.

1119
01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.553
I told you it was
over. I made myself clear.

1120
01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:38.639
Oh, you did. You made yourself
perfectly clear,

1121
01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.516
but something's come up.

1122
01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:44.561
- What?
- It's something kind of small,

1123
01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.188
but it might be a big problem.

1124
01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:49.608
- I'm pregnant.
- Huh?

1125
01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.151
I'm pregnant.

1126
01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:56.031
I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificates,

1127
01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:58.659
and there's no doubt about it.
I'm gonna have your baby.

1128
01:24:08.752 --> 01:24:10.420
You should see the other guy.

1129
01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:19.763
What the fuck happened to her?

1130
01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:23.809
Oh, she started shriekin',
you know.

1131
01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:25.185
Jesus.

1132
01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:27.563
Well, I got the money.

1133
01:24:28.438 --> 01:24:31.316
All of it. All 80 grand.

1134
01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:36.321
That's 40 for you. 40 for me.

1135
01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:39.408
That's it, then.

1136
01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:47.332
You can have my truck.
I'm takin' the Ciera.

1137
01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:49.376
We split that.

1138
01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:54.506
How the fuck do you split
a fuckin' car, you dummy?

1139
01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:56.550
With a fuckin' chain saw?

1140
01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:59.761
One of us pays the
other for half.

1141
01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:02.639
Hold on. No fuckin' way.

1142
01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.058
Did you fuckin' notice this?

1143
01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.270
I got fuckin' shot!

1144
01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:10.606
I got fuckin' shot in the face.

1145
01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:12.608
I went and got the
fuckin' money.

1146
01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:14.192
I got shot fuckin'
pickin" it up.

1147
01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:17.112
I've been up for 36
fuckin' hours.

1148
01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.366
I'm takin' that fuckin' car.
That fucker's mine,

1149
01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:23.493
you fuckin' asshole.

1150
01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:25.912
I've had to listen to
your fuckin' bullshit all week.

1151
01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.415
Are we square?

1152
01:25:30.334 --> 01:25:32.044
Are we square?

1153
01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:36.089
Yeah, you fuckin' mute.

1154
01:25:38.342 --> 01:25:40.427
If you see your friend
Shep Proudfoot,

1155
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.512
tell him I'm gonna nail
his fuckin' ass.

1156
01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:01.782
His wife, this guy says,
was kidnapped last Wednesday.

1157
01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:04.660
- The day of our homicides.
- Yah.

1158
01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:06.161
And this guy was who?

1159
01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:08.538
Lundegaard's
father-in-law's accountant.

1160
01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:11.625
- Gustafson's accountant?
- Yah.

1161
01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:13.627
But we still haven't
found Gustafson?

1162
01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:18.840
- Sorry. Didn't copy, Lou.
- Still missing. We're looking.

1163
01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:23.595
- Copy. And Lundegaard, too?
- Yah. Where are ya, Margie?

1164
01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:26.431
I'm almost back. I'm takin'
a drive round Moose Lake.

1165
01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:30.060
- Oh, Gary's loudmouth.
- Yah, the loudmouth.

1166
01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.605
So the whole state has it, huh?
Gustafson and Lundegaard.

1167
01:26:33.689 --> 01:26:36.650
Yah, it's over the wire. It's
everywhere. They'll find them.

1168
01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:39.111
- Copy.
- Yah, we got a lead on a...

1169
01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:41.113
There's the car!
There's the car!

1170
01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:42.364
Whose car?

1171
01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:45.659
My car! My car!
Tan Ciera. Tan Ciera.

1172
01:26:46.118 --> 01:26:48.870
OK. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple of cars.

1173
01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:43.693
Police!

1174
01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:53.036
Hands up!

1175
01:28:53.453 --> 01:28:54.579
Police!

1176
01:28:58.083 --> 01:28:59.376
Police!

1177
01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:02.105
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there?

1178
01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:11.156
And I guess that was your
accomplice in the wood chipper.

1179
01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:17.871
And those three
people in Brainerd.

1180
01:30:23.627 --> 01:30:24.794
And for what?

1181
01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:27.797
For a little bit of money.

1182
01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:36.222
There's more to life
than a little money, you know.

1183
01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:47.943
Don't you know that?

1184
01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:55.992
And here y'are.

1185
01:30:57.702 --> 01:30:59.788
- And it's a beautiful day.

1186
01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:10.131
Well.

1187
01:31:23.186 --> 01:31:24.896
I just don't understand it.

1188
01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:08.732
Mr. Anderson?

1189
01:32:10.442 --> 01:32:12.736
- Who?
- Mr. Anderson.

1190
01:32:12.986 --> 01:32:14.904
Is this your burgundy
'98 out here?

1191
01:32:16.448 --> 01:32:17.824
Just a sec.

1192
01:32:17.991 --> 01:32:19.784
Could you open the
door, please?

1193
01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:21.536
Yah, yah, just a sec.

1194
01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:23.747
Just a sec.

1195
01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:34.299
No!

1196
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.165
Ooh.

1197
01:33:13.838 --> 01:33:15.256
They announced it.

1198
01:33:17.217 --> 01:33:19.302
- They announced it?
- Yah.

1199
01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:21.346
So?

1200
01:33:22.347 --> 01:33:23.473
Three-cent stamp.

1201
01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:27.143
- Your mallard?
- Yah.

1202
01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:29.771
Oh, that's terrific.

1203
01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:33.817
- It's just the three-cent.
- It's terrific.

1204
01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:36.319
Hautmans' blue-winged teal
got the 29-cent.

1205
01:33:36.945 --> 01:33:39.072
People don't much
use the three-cent.

1206
01:33:39.322 --> 01:33:41.157
Oh, for Pete's sake,
of course, they do.

1207
01:33:43.243 --> 01:33:46.079
Whenever they raise the postage,
people need the little stamps.

1208
01:33:47.205 --> 01:33:48.289
Yeah?

1209
01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:51.000
When they're stuck with
a bunch of the old ones.

1210
01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:54.629
Yah, I guess.

1211
01:33:56.506 --> 01:33:59.384
It's terrific.
I'm so proud of you, Norm.

1212
01:34:03.096 --> 01:34:05.306
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doin' pretty good.

1213
01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:10.145
I love you, Margie.

1214
01:34:11.396 --> 01:34:12.897
I love you, Norm.

1215
01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:17.819
Two more months.

1216
01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:22.949
Two more months.
