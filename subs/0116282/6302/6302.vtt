15
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:22,412
Have you told Miss Brawne
of our summer holiday, or shall I?

16
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:27,851
Not as yet.

17
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:36,821
Mr. Brown is doing his summer rental,
so we both have to Leave.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,903
We're meeting up on the Isle of Wight
for some undisturbed writing and carousing.

19
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,151
Mrs. Brawne, may I speak to Fanny, please?

20
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,952
No, I will not speak to him.

21
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,790
Fanny, I was going to tell you.

22
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,435
Fanny, I have no money.

23
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,768
In fact, I am in debt.

24
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:28,681
I must earn. I must write and make a Living.

25
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,050
If I fail, though I hate to think on it,

26
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:35,986
then I must make way so another may marry
and adore you as I wish to.

27
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:42,289
No! I will not be adored ever again
by you or by anyone!

28
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,064
I hate you!

29
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:12,381
Anything?

30
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,959
No. Nothing.

31
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,194
Nothing.

32
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,838
Fanny, will you check my stitch?
It's an open-work seam.

33
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:31,910
God.

34
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:35,111
No, Toots. I don't care a damn for stitches!

35
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,966
-No letter?
-Not today.

36
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,109
Am I in Love?

37
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,451
Is this Love?

38
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,328
I shall never tease about it again.

39
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,793

-No, Mama, they Love the heat.

Mama, don't be cross.

When I don't hear from him,
it's as if I've died,

but when I receive a Letter,

87

I know our world is real.
It's the one I care for.

88

Watch the butterfly.

00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,312
Well, move it.

-Fanny wants a knife.
-What for?

91
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,423
To kill herself.

92

It's all over.

93
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,702
I have such a short letter after all this time.

94
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,175
No, Topper!

95
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,883
Saying he was in London, in London,

96
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:54,051
and couldn’t bring himself to visit
for fear it would burn him up!

97
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,820
He's made no fortune and is ashamed of it.

98
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:03,528
If only he knew how Little I, even you,
care for that now.

99
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,145
You missed that one.

100
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,991
-Hello.
-Hello.

101
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:41,703
Mama asked me to welcome you home
and introduce you to Miss O'Donoghue,

102
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,777
our new maid who may also do for you.

103
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:47,710
Please, sir, call me Abigail or Abby.

104
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,515
Very well. Be sure you do not enter
if the door is closed.

105
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,845
Yes, sir.

106
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,260
Mr. Keats is not coming back.
He has gone to Live in London.

107
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:11,433
Please tell Mr. Keats that we Brawnes
have kept safe all his things.

108
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,815
Mr. Brown has said that
I could learn to read still.

109
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,118
I said to him, ''Sure, what would I read?''

110
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:37,059
And he said, ''Abigail, even the Bible
is not so dull as you might believe.''

111
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:42,294
And that in the Songs of Solomon,
there are some bits so juicy,

112
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,961
they'd make even a churchman blush.

113
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:49,004
And he said that when I get down
to the reading myself,

114
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:52,442
I'II see he tells not one word of a lie.

115
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:09,861
Hello, Toots.

116
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,869
Hello, Mr. Keats.

117
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,275
Hello, Miss Brawne.

118
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,286
Mother? We found it.
Fanny had the key, Like I thought.

119
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,940
What do you need for London?

120
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,208
Your vest has no lining.

121
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,409
And your coat

122
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,525
has a small hole.

123
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,325
I could mend it so you wouldn’t see it.

124
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,068
<i>''My sweet girl,
I am living today in yesterday.</i>

125
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:05,074

126
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,103
<i>''I feel myself at your mercy.</i>

129
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:16,552
<i>''You dazzled me.</i>

130
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,989
<i>''There is nothing in the world
so bright and delicate.</i>

131
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,592
<i>''You have absorbed me.</i>

132
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,689
<i>''I have a sensation at the present moment
as if I was dissolving. ''</i>

133
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:49,722
Fanny, Mrs. Dilke is telling me that

134
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,859
Mr. Keats is proposing
to move in next door again,

135
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,689
and she wants to know
if I have any objections.

136
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,559
Of course you don't.

137
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:03,298
Mr. Brown is Mr. Keats' best friend.
Why would we object?

138
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,932
Fanny, Mr. Dilke and I are worried

139
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:13,274
that such close connection
may prove restrictive for you.

140
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:14,703
No.

141
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:19,475
Mr. Keats can't afford to marry.

142
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,017
His situation is really quite hopeless,

143
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,559
and if he is next door,
how will you meet anyone else?

144
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:28,695
How will you go to dances?

145
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:31,726
But you are engaged?

146
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,958
It's his mother's ring.
It's not an engagement ring.

147
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,069
You were not to wear it.

148
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:38,137
I wear it on the finger next door.

149
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,329
Do not even discuss it.

150
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:44,433
You taught me to Love. You never said
only the rich, only a thimbleful.

151
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,880
Attachment is such a difficult thing to undo.

152
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,490
''Pillowed upon
my fair love's ripening breast

153
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,487
''To feel forever its soft swell and fall

154
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,564
''Awake forever in a sweet unrest

155
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:56,105
''Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath''

156
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,447
That's new.

157
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,287
From which poem?

158
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,748
Yours.

159
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,296
''Bright star,

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,174
''would I were steadfast as thou art

00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,745
''Not in Ione splendor hung aloft the night''

162
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,550
Why do you say ''not''?

163
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,023
''Not in Ione splendor''?

164
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:54,256
You fear I am not steadfast because
I oblige Mama by going to a dance?

165
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,568
Don't tease, Fanny.

166
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,470
Why are you Laughing?

167
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,807
I shall tell her I am unwell.

168
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:12,481
No, go.

169
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,113
Go.

170
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:20,556
Go.

171
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,721
Good Irish Abigail,

172
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:29,927
who never did fail to make a scone
as good as a swan.

173
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,207
Would you Like some jam with that, sir?

174
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,607
Please.

175
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,746
Delicious.

176
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:58,052
Fanny! Come in. It's turned cold.

177
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:01,162
Mr. Keats has gone to London with no coat.

178
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,661
John, have you had wine?

179
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,337
I was severely chilled.

180
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,576
I was on the outside of the coach,

181
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,518
but now I don't feel it.

182
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:55,485
Abigail!

183
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:00,358
Abigail! Get up, dress yourself.
We need a doctor.

184
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,798
Abigail, bring the water.

185
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,259
I need a basin and a towel.

186
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,798
And glasses, I need glasses.

187
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,635
-Let me help. I can...
-Stand back, stand back.

188
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,998
Keats has already asked to see Miss Brawne,

189
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,406
but I've managed him
and said that she had gone into town.

190
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,142
But I have not.

191
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,612
I am speaking of keeping Mr. Keats calm.

192
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,218
This is a deception I will not join.

193
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,820
No, no, it is not a deception.

194
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:07,084
I am simply determined
to preserve the Life of my friend.

195
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,653
You would have it that
I kill Mr. Keats with affection.

196
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,094
-Fanny!
-Perhaps you will.

197
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:16,725
Apparently, there is nothing I can do to
persuade you of the gravity of the situation,

198
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,499
but Keats is in my care
and all visits will follow my regime

199
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,902
or they will not happen at all.

200
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:26,444
Please, we Brawnes will do whatever we can
to restore Mr. Keats to health.

201
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:45,121
I was wondering where you were.

202
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:49,397
I have been waiting
to be with you the whole day.

203
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,635
Last night there was a...

204
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,281
There was a great rush of blood,

205
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:08,514
such that I thought that I would suffocate.

206
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:16,027
And I said to Mr. Brown,
''This is unfortunate.''

207
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:20,657
My thoughts were of you.

208
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:55,357
<i>''My sweet creature, when I send this round,
I shall be in the front parlor,</i>

209
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:59,527
<i>''watching to see you show yourself
for a minute in the garden.</i>

210
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:07,339
<i>''When I look back upon the ecstasies
in which I have passed some days</i>

211
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,539
<i>''and the miseries in their turn,</i>

212
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:14,085
<i>''I wonder the more at the beauty
which has kept up the spell so fervently.</i>

213
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:19,084
<i>''How horrid was the chance of slipping
into the ground instead of into your arms.</i>

214
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:23,124
<i>''The difference is amazing, love. ''</i>

215
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:32,793
-Go on! Go on, now!
-No, Brown. Brown. Brown.

216
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,503
I get anxious if I don't see her.

217
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,372
Why not bed her?

218
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,076
She'd do whatever you wished.

219
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:48,948
It might relieve your condition.

220
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:04,559
<i>''Do not take the trouble of writing much.</i>

221
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:08,970
<i>''Merely send me my good night
to put under my pillow. John Keats. ''</i>

222
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:57,550
<i>''Let me no longer detain you
from going to town.</i>

223
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:01,191
<i>''There may be no end
to this imprisoning of you.</i>

224
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:06,227
<i>''Perhaps you had better not come
before tomorrow evening.</i>

225
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:11,895
<i>''You know our situation. I am recommended
not even to read poetry, much less write it.</i>

226
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,633
<i>''I wish I had even a little hope.</i>

227
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,374
<i>''I cannot say forget me,</i>

228
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,075
<i>''but I would mention that
there are impossibilities in the world. ''</i>

229
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:13,625
John, why do you say ''impossibilities''?

230
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:18,228
I have coughed blood again.

231
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,976
I fear the disease has the upper hand

232
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:31,740
and I will not recover.

233
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,209
I can't Leave you.

234
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:40,184
I have such clear hope
for your new book of poems.

235
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:45,392
John, they are more beautiful than
any I have read of Mr. Coleridge,

236
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:48,762
Mr. Wordsworth, even Lord Byron.

237
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:56,006
''O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms

238
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,043
''Alone and palely loitering?

239
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:08,420
''The sedge has wither'd from the Lake
And no birds sing''

240
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:14,190
''I met a lady in the meads

241
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:20,460
''Full beautiful, a faery's child

242
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:25,867
''Her hair was Long, her foot was light

243
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:28,900
''And her eyes were wild

244
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:34,435
''I set her on my pacing steed

245
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:38,550
''And nothing else saw all day Long

246
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:46,120
''For sidelong would she bend and sing
A faery's song''

247
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,625
''She found me roots of relish sweet

248
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:54,456
''And honey wild, and manna dew

249
00:28:56,903 --> 00:29:02,034
''And sure in language strange she said
'I Love thee true'''

250
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,475
''She took me to her elfin grot''

251
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:09,809
''And there she wept, and sigh'd full sore''

252
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:15,485
''And there I shut her wild wild eyes
With kisses four

253
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,023
''And there she lulled me asleep

254
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,521
''And there I dream'd, ah! woe betide!

255
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,293
''The latest dream I ever dream'd

256
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,268
''On the cold hill side''

257
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,242
Abigail?

258
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:52,918
Here it is.
Mr. Brown said to give it to you tomorrow,

259
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,651
but I'II not wait.

260
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,864
He is the most cruel,

261
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,597
dead-hearted man in this entire world.

262
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,238
Oh, my God!

263
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:12,504
Oh, my God, I wish I were dead.

264
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,307
I am boiling with fury.

265
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:18,815
John, you must not convulse again.

266
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:24,787
Abigail is with child,
but to whom, out of fear or shame,

267
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,323
she would not say.

268
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,353
We, Brown, must find out who it is,
and when we have his name,

269
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,898
then butcher or baker,
he shall face up to his indecency.

270
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,471
-Will you call her?
-It's not necessary.

271
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:46,610
She has me believe I'm the father.

272
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,407
My God, I had no notion of a Love affair.

273
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:59,514
There was none,
or I must have slept through it.

274
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,788
With what ease you help yourself.

275
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,490
I have agreed to pay for the child.

276
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:14,305
And the worst thing is
I can't keep this place.

277
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:18,236
I have to start my summer rental early.

278
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:23,781
And I feel wretched turning you out
while you are so unwell,

279
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,144
but, John, I can't do anything else.

280
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,252
I'm overloaded with debt.

281
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,083
Don't concern yourself.

282
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,825
-I shall manage.
-Stupid. Stupid.

283
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,238
In what stumbling ways a new soul is begun.

284
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:52,534
I'd very much value your opinion, Mr. Keats,

285
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:56,307
<i>on a new painting of mine,
The Cave of Despair. I was...</i>

286
00:31:56,449 --> 00:31:59,043
If you are suggesting he won't survive
another winter in England,

287
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:00,549
then we must do something.

288
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:03,211
Gentlemen, I think we should hear
Dr. Bree on the issue of climate

289
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:04,549
for Keats' health.

290
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:07,591
Well, a move to a gentler climate
is essential.

291
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:09,722
I would recommend Italy.

292
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:11,853
-Rome?
-Rome is good.

293
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:16,168
-Does he want to go to Rome?
-Well, he has to go.

294
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:18,998
He won't Live through another winter
in England.

295
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,400
How do you feel about Italy, John?

296
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,012
I do think there is an issue of finance.

297
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:35,609
Could we not, between us,
start a fund or a coIIection?

298
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:38,155
It seems possible.

299
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,721
Of course, he'll need a traveling companion.
Brown, you’ll go?

300
00:32:44,864 --> 00:32:46,422
Absolutely, absolutely.

301
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:50,296
Someone must go.
I'm not sure I shall be able.

302
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:53,064
-Is that a ''no''?
-Miss. Miss.

303
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:07,617
I can help find a room for the summer,
John, if you want.

304
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:12,983
Sammy, walk behind.

305
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,663
I want to go to Italy with you.

306
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:21,796
We can marry, and I'II go with you.

307
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:25,468
My friends talk of going to Italy,
but I have so Little money.

308
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,435
Spare a penny, sir?

309
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:30,041
I can barely afford
these Kentish Town rooms.

310
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,376
Farewell me here.

311
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,478
Why?

312
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,640
We don't do linen.

313
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,725
AII right, I'm coming!

314
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:07,403
Mr. Hunt can't have meant this room.

315
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,254
I told you not to come.

316
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,084
Go now.

317
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,362
Go.

318
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,400
Please start.

319
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,834
-Please start.
-Where's Fanny?

320
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:36,907
Thank you.

321
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,801
She's not eating.

322
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,950
Are you all right?

323
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:02,525
How Long has Mr. Keats been away?

324
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:03,965
Five weeks.

325
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:07,763
Perhaps it is for the best.

326
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:10,500
Whose best?

327
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:17,113
I thought it might be a relief to be separated
when the circumstances are so difficult.

328
00:35:18,017 --> 00:35:22,283
You all wish I would give up, but I can't.

329
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,948
Even if I wanted to, I cannot.

330
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,427
John!

331
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,240
Keep away from me if you do not Love me,

332
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:19,242
if you have not a crystal conscience
this past month.

333
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,569
Oh, my Love.

334
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,747
I thought my heart was breaking.

335
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,727
Mama! Mama!

336
00:36:39,098 --> 00:36:40,429
Mr. Keats?

337
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,934
Toots, the door.

338
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,074
Take care.

339
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:58,081
John. John?

340
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:04,819
Thank you.

341
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,160
-Was there any blood?
-No.

342
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:14,127
Is he staying here?

343
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,526
Yes, yes. Tonight.

344
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:22,073
Well, I need to examine the patient.

345
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:37,649
May he stay tomorrow?
Till he Leaves for Italy?

346
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,523
But you are not even officiaIIy engaged.

347
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,784
Can't we be?

348
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,894
There is no end to this.

349
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:50,263
Next, you’ll want to marry
then travel to Rome.

350
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,664
I should never have moved into this house.

351
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:54,795
I have let this happen.

352
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,430
Just until Italy.

353
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:02,571
You are already the source
of so much gossip.

354
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:04,842
Well then, Let us be engaged.

355
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,050
Toots.

356
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,303
Have you been eating rosebuds again?

357
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,632
So where do your cheeks get their blush?

358
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:15,749
<i>I confirmed your ship,
the Maria Crowther, sailing for Naples.</i>

359
00:39:16,255 --> 00:39:17,279
When does she Leave?

360
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:18,718
-In 10 days.
-So soon?

361
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:19,881
Autumn is coming.

362
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:23,516
I'm afraid if you delay
there'll be less and less reason to hope.

363
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,261
Then there's no putting it off.

364
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,326
I must march against the battery.

365
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:32,266
Allow me to pour you another, Mr. Severn.

366
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,235
Really? Well, perhaps I might just tip it back.

367
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,637
-Is his passage fully paid for?
-Yes, yes.

368
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:38,367
Everything's taken care of.

369
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,677
What if something should happen
to Mr. Keats

370
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:48,981
or even to you, in a foreign country?

371
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,849
How would you survive?

372
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:56,723
It shouldn’t be Severn. He barely knows him.

373
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:59,293
Where is that fool Mr. Brown
when he is needed?

374
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:01,399
And why hasn't he written?

375
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:06,299
I found a goose for Mr. Keats' Last dinner.

376
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:11,400
Don't say ''Last.''

377
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:23,414
...two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. And one, two, three.

378
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,887
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

379
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:28,959
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

380
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,125
Toots?

381
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:41,100
Mr. Keats?

382
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,901
One, two, three...

383
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:49,679
-She's gone.
-What happened there?

384
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:03,123
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

385
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:04,593
Very good.

386
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:12,892
And don't come back.
There's no autumn around here.

387
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,799
Careful.

388
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:19,067
Are you all right?

389
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,404
Shall we sit down?

390
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,167
Mrs. Brawne, that's for you.

391
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:28,703
It's beautiful.

392
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,682
My dear, mad boy.

393
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:34,175
Is it successful?

394
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:38,087
There were two very positive reviews,
by friends,

395
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:43,393
and six mainly positive and four hostile.

396
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:47,822
I don't know, is that successful?

397
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:50,400
Yes, extremely so.

398
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:53,136
So they're selling well?

399
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,470
Come back. Live with us.

400
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:03,814
Marry our Fanny.

401
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:22,029
I Love you.

402
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,436
We should say our goodbyes now.

403
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:50,851
Shall we awake

404
00:43:56,435 --> 00:43:58,562
and find all this is a dream?

405
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:04,200
There must be another Life.

406
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:07,539
We can't be created
for this kind of suffering.

407
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:23,360
I doubt that we will see each other again
on this earth.

408
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:32,101
Then why are you leaving?

409
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:35,563
Why must you go?

410
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:39,342
Because my friends have paid my way.

411
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:43,005
It is a hopeless hope,
but how can I refuse them?

412
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:44,843
Say you are too ill.

413
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:49,753
We have woven a web, you and I,

414
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,715
attached to this world

415
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,624
but a separate world of our own invention.

416
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,660
We must cut the threads, Fanny.

417
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,458
No.

418
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:04,896
No.

419
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:09,536
I can't.

420
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,107
I never will.

421
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:25,181
You know I would do anything.

422
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:34,326
I have a conscience.

423
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:55,284
-Let's pretend I will return in spring.
-You will return.

424
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:09,557
We will Live in the country.

425
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,537
Close to Mama.

426
00:46:16,508 --> 00:46:19,875
And our bedroom will Look out
onto a Little apple orchard

427
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:23,537
and, beyond that, a mountain in a mist.

428
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:29,647
We can make a garden
where every sort of wildflower grows.

429
00:46:32,057 --> 00:46:35,959
And we will go to bed
while the sun is still high.

430
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:42,523
And when it becomes dark,
the moon will shine through the shutters.

431
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:54,035
And I will hold you close
and kiss your breasts,

432
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:59,748
your arms, your waist.

433
00:47:04,356 --> 00:47:05,687
Everywhere.

434
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:19,363
Touch has a memory.

435
00:47:21,773 --> 00:47:23,035
I know it.

436
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:55,936
Not a word.

437
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,749
Mama, Mr. Brown's baby has red hair.

438
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,410
Hello!

439
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:46,817
You beautiful boy.

440
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:50,918
Hello. Well done. Well done.

441
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:52,860
Hello.

442
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,399
It is so nice to meet you.

443
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,671
You've seen the baby?

444
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,972
Looks Like Abigail.

445
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:13,980
John's reached Naples.

446
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:17,621
They quarantined his ship.

447
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:23,823
He wrote that he made more puns
out of desperation in two weeks

448
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:26,590
than he had in any year of his Life.

449
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:33,131
I should have Liked to have been there
to have heard them.

450
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:37,299
You could have, had you gone.

451
00:49:46,418 --> 00:49:48,147
It's not that simple,

452
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,346
with a baby and my funds reduced.

453
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:59,529
And then there is this issue
of the snow and the Alps.

454
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:01,625
And lack of will.

455
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:11,770
Shall I say it aloud?

456
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:14,176
Will that satisfy you?

457
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,747
Shall I say it?

458
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:22,919
I have failed John Keats.

459
00:50:23,655 --> 00:50:25,555
I failed John Keats.

460
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:30,320
I failed John Keats!

461
00:50:30,662 --> 00:50:33,563
I failed him! I failed him!

462
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:41,463
I did not know until now how tightly
he'd wound himself around my heart.

463
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:54,674
It's for you, Mama. It's from Italy.

464
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:12,897
It's from Mr. Keats.

465
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:16,869
He says, ''It looks Like a dream.''

466
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:39,720
Start again.

467
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:15,858
It's cold out.

468
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:20,095
How are you all?

469
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:23,359
We're all quite well enough,
but how is Mr. Keats?

470
00:53:24,002 --> 00:53:28,803
Mrs. Brawne, it is as unbearable to me

471
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:32,799
as I know it is to you.

472
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:36,874
Mr. Keats has died.

473
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:42,180
I received an account from Severn,

474
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:46,955
and I've copied it for you, Miss Brawne.

475
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,089
Shall I just read it?

476
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,233
''Friday, the 23rd of February.

477
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,979

478
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:16,553

479
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:19,322

00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:24,125

481
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:31,028
<i>''At one point, a cold, heavy sweat broke out
over his whole body, and he whispered,</i>

482
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:36,300
<i>'''Don't breathe on me. It comes like ice. '</i>

483
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:39,533
<i>''Keats died imperceptibly. ''</i>

484
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:41,075
No more.

485
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:08,699
Oh, God.

486
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:14,842
Oh, God. John!

487

489
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:34,822
I... I can't breathe.
