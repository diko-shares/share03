00:00:30.307 --> 00:00:32.809
<i>We've put an explosive charge
in your head.</i>

2
00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:40.734
Does that sound familiar?

3
00:00:43.904 --> 00:00:46.156
The rabbit's foot. Where is it?

4
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.909
I gave it to you.

5
00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:52.037
Ethan, where's the rabbit's foot?

6
00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:55.916
Wait... what are you saying?
That wasn't it?

7
00:00:56.416 --> 00:00:59.670
- What I gave you, was that...
-L'm going to count to 10.

8
00:00:59.753 --> 00:01:03.840
You're going to tell me
where the rabbit's foot is or she dies.

9
00:01:11.848 --> 00:01:14.267
Jules, it's going to be okay.

10
00:01:15.394 --> 00:01:18.021
It's going to be okay.
Do you understand?

11
00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:20.273
One.

12
00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:23.694
You listen to me.
I got exactly what you asked for.

13
00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:26.071
Did you want something else?

14
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:28.323
If there was a misunderstanding,
i will fix it.

15
00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:30.325
I can get it, whatever you want.

16
00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.618
Two.

17
00:01:32.077 --> 00:01:35.122
Listen. Talk to me. We can talk,

18
00:01:35.455 --> 00:01:37.040
like gentlemen.

19
00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:40.961
- Three.
- God!

20
00:01:50.137 --> 00:01:52.806
All right. All right, all right.

21
00:01:54.307 --> 00:01:56.810
I know where the rabbit's foot is.

22
00:01:57.978 --> 00:01:59.146
I can help you.

23
00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.940
The way you helped me
on the airplane?

24
00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.692
That way?

25
00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:06.737
You put the gun down.
I'm not talking to you like this.

26
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.281
That's your choice. Four.

27
00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:12.242
The rabbit's foot's in Paris.

28
00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:15.078
You want to know where in Paris?
Then let her go.

29
00:02:15.162 --> 00:02:18.290
-'Cause you will not...
-Lt's not in Paris. Five.

30
00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:21.793
I can get it for you.

31
00:02:21.877 --> 00:02:23.795
But you kill her, you do this,
you get nothing.

32
00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.131
- Six.
- Are you listening to me?

33
00:02:26.214 --> 00:02:29.426
The only way you're going
to get what you want is for you to...

34
00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.595
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

35
00:02:31.678 --> 00:02:34.055
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

36
00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.974
Where is it? Where the hell is it?

37
00:02:36.057 --> 00:02:37.559
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

38
00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:40.061
- Stay with me.
- Seven! Seven!

39
00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:44.691
Lam going to kill you.
I swear to god I'm going to kill you!

40
00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:46.860
- Eight!
- No, please.

41
00:02:52.032 --> 00:02:55.702
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

42
00:02:57.287 --> 00:03:00.624
I promise you. I promise you.

43
00:03:00.707 --> 00:03:03.376
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

44
00:03:04.544 --> 00:03:06.713
Listen to me. Listen to me.

45
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.175
I want to help you.

46
00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:12.969
I want to help you get
whatever you want.

47
00:03:13.053 --> 00:03:16.807
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

48
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.690
No. No.

49
00:03:29.402 --> 00:03:30.487
No.

50
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.030
- Ten.
- Don't!

51
00:04:10.277 --> 00:04:12.195
- What are you doing?
- Your brother wants another one.

52
00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:13.989
Oh, god, no.
Ethan, that's what we talked about...

53
00:04:14.072 --> 00:04:16.032
-I'm watching him. He's fine.
- That's how it is with Rick.

54
00:04:16.116 --> 00:04:18.702
He's fine and then suddenly he's naked
and he's hugging everybody.

55
00:04:18.785 --> 00:04:21.705
<i>-L'll</i> take full responsibility for Rick.
- You will? Full?

56
00:04:21.788 --> 00:04:24.291
- Well, mostly full.
-Lt's a huge responsibility.

57
00:04:24.374 --> 00:04:25.959
It's going well, right?

58
00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:28.378
- It's going really well.
- Yeah.

59
00:04:29.462 --> 00:04:31.214
Julia, your sister's here.

60
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:34.134
- Give me a hug.
- You look so beautiful.

61
00:04:34.217 --> 00:04:36.303
I don't know about that. So, is this him?

62
00:04:36.386 --> 00:04:39.055
- I hope so.
- Oh, come here. Oh, gosh.

63
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.725
All right. Mom's dying to see you.

64
00:04:41.808 --> 00:04:43.852
I can't believe
you guys came all the way to Virginia.

65
00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:45.186
Like we'd miss your engagement...

66
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.149
When Julia called and told me
that she was getting married,

67
00:04:49.232 --> 00:04:52.235
I had one thought,
that it was just too bad

68
00:04:53.278 --> 00:04:56.615
that daddy wasn't here
to walk her down the aisle.

69
00:04:57.157 --> 00:04:59.910
And then when Julia told me...
Thanks, mom.

70
00:04:59.993 --> 00:05:02.495
That Ethan doesn't have
his parents anymore, either,

71
00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:04.414
I got really sad.

72
00:05:04.497 --> 00:05:08.668
But it occurred to me
that this is about starting a new family

73
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.754
and how beautiful that is.

74
00:05:10.837 --> 00:05:14.007
And I just want to say
i am making Julia an aunt,

75
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.927
so I expect the same treatment
very, very soon.

76
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.303
Cheers!

77
00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:25.268
Department of transportation?

78
00:05:25.352 --> 00:05:27.604
I've been there over 10 years now.
Wow.

79
00:05:27.687 --> 00:05:29.272
What do you do at the dot?

80
00:05:29.356 --> 00:05:30.899
I study traffic patterns.

81
00:05:30.982 --> 00:05:33.276
You hit the brakes for a second,
just tap them on the freeway,

82
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.278
you can literally track
the ripple effect of that action

83
00:05:35.362 --> 00:05:36.905
across a 200-mile stretch of road,

84
00:05:36.988 --> 00:05:38.281
because traffic has a memory.

85
00:05:38.365 --> 00:05:40.408
It's amazing. It's like a living organism.

86
00:05:40.492 --> 00:05:42.202
Freshen that up for you?
What is it, vodka Martini?

87
00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:43.411
Yeah. Thanks.

88
00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:45.455
Ladies, do you need...

89
00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:50.460
-I'd marry him.
- I would, too.

90
00:05:50.543 --> 00:05:53.421
Okay, so, a three-week
heli-boarding honeymoon?

91
00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:56.466
- Okay, you actually get dropped...
- From a helicopter, yeah.

92
00:05:56.549 --> 00:05:58.510
- It's how they met.
- Really?

93
00:05:58.593 --> 00:06:00.470
- Tell her the story.
- There's no story.

94
00:06:00.553 --> 00:06:02.180
It is a good story. Tell the story.

95
00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:05.350
First of all,
no one was ever good enough for Julia.

96
00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:06.685
Oh, here we go.

97
00:06:06.768 --> 00:06:10.730
Not spontaneous enough,
adventurous enough, funny enough...

98
00:06:10.855 --> 00:06:13.650
You know what? No, that's not true.
You make it sound like I've never dated.

99
00:06:13.733 --> 00:06:14.776
No one we liked.

100
00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:16.695
- That is true.
- That is true.

101
00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:34.045
Then she goes and gets in a chopper
that takes off from this lake...

102
00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:36.965
- What was the name of that lake?
- Lakeâ€œ.

103
00:06:37.924 --> 00:06:40.427
Lake wanaka. Wanaka.

104
00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:42.929
Wanaka. Thank you.

105
00:06:44.097 --> 00:06:45.807
- He heard that?
- How did he hear that?

106
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.851
And the hospital's cool
with you taking three weeks?

107
00:06:47.934 --> 00:06:50.979
Yeah, I'm not the only nurse
employed there, you know.

108
00:07:16.588 --> 00:07:18.882
I'm psyched that you're going
to be my brother, man.

109
00:07:18.965 --> 00:07:20.050
So am I, Rick.

110
00:07:20.133 --> 00:07:22.010
No, it's awesome.
I think it's going to be sick.

111
00:07:22.093 --> 00:07:24.512
Me, too, man.
I just got to get the phone.

112
00:07:24.596 --> 00:07:26.473
- You rock hard.
- Okay.

113
00:07:27.474 --> 00:07:28.558
Hello?

114
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:30.810
<i>- Is this Mr. Ethan hunt?
Mes, 'Ms.</i>

115
00:07:30.894 --> 00:07:33.396
<i>This is ready-travel resort services.</i>

116
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.151
<i>We'd like to offer you a chance to win
an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.</i>

117
00:07:56.795 --> 00:07:58.838
We ran out of ice.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

118
00:07:58.922 --> 00:08:01.216
- Oh, no. Can't somebody else go?
- No, I got it.

119
00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:03.259
I'll be right back. Hi, Betsy.

120
00:08:03.343 --> 00:08:04.677
Thank you.

121
00:08:22.362 --> 00:08:23.822
$1.86.

122
00:08:33.373 --> 00:08:37.210
Thanks for coming.
Can't decide what size slurpee to get.

123
00:08:37.836 --> 00:08:40.296
I usually go for the 900-ouncer.

124
00:08:42.006 --> 00:08:44.634
How's that party? Sorry I had to call you.

125
00:08:44.717 --> 00:08:46.761
- Yeah, you should have come.
- You should have invited me.

126
00:08:46.845 --> 00:08:49.222
- You know I would have.
- Thanks.

127
00:08:51.724 --> 00:08:54.811
I know we joke about it, but I am always
this close to begging you

128
00:08:54.894 --> 00:08:57.313
to stop training our people
and get your ass back in the field.

129
00:08:57.397 --> 00:09:00.275
But that's not what you do anymore,
and so I respect that choice.

130
00:09:00.358 --> 00:09:04.529
You know I do. Family's everything.

131
00:09:06.739 --> 00:09:09.075
Come on, John. What's going on?

132
00:09:12.996 --> 00:09:14.747
It's agent farris.

133
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:17.417
She was on an operation.

134
00:09:18.084 --> 00:09:21.546
She's disappeared.
Been off-grid 11 hours.

135
00:09:23.214 --> 00:09:27.177
I'm sending in search and rescue.
I was hoping you'd want in.

136
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.309
You've got good people for that.

137
00:09:37.312 --> 00:09:39.939
Yeah. Yep, that we do.

138
00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:43.943
Wheels up at sunrise
if you have a change of heart.

139
00:09:44.485 --> 00:09:47.280
Take some pictures of the party for me.

140
00:10:06.966 --> 00:10:08.718
<i>Ethan. Three days ago,</i>

141
00:10:08.801 --> 00:10:12.347
<i>agent Lindsey farris was captured
while on a surveillance operation.</i>

142
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.183
<i>This is the man she was tracking.
His name is Owen Davian.</i>

143
00:10:15.266 --> 00:10:16.559
<i>Details are eyes-only,</i>

144
00:10:16.643 --> 00:10:19.437
<i>but I can tell you
that Davian's a black-market trafficker.</i>

145
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.440
<i>Extremely dangerous
and a priority for us.</i>

146
00:10:22.774 --> 00:10:24.525
<i>At 1400 hours today,</i>

147
00:10:24.609 --> 00:10:26.778
<i>a recon satellite ID 'd
a caravan of vehicles</i>

148
00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:30.531
<i>with plates matching those known to
have been used by Davian's operatives.</i>

149
00:10:30.615 --> 00:10:33.201
<i>They stopped at a derelict factory
outside Berlin.</i>

150
00:10:33.284 --> 00:10:36.537
<i>It appears they have a hostage.
We believe it's agent farris.</i>

151
00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:38.748
<i>Normally we would disavow,</i>

152
00:10:38.831 --> 00:10:40.917
<i>but Lindsey may be the key
to getting us closer to Davian,</i>

153
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.710
<i>and that's a risk we need to take.</i>

154
00:10:42.794 --> 00:10:45.546
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

155
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.258
<i>is to find Lindsey and bring her home.</i>

156
00:10:48.967 --> 00:10:51.094
<i>I've already assembled a team.</i>

157
00:10:51.469 --> 00:10:53.596
<i>I have them standing by,
awaiting your word.</i>

158
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:59.060
<i>This message, let's call it
my excellent engagement gift to you,</i>

159
00:10:59.143 --> 00:11:00.812
<i>will self-destruct in five seconds.</i>

160
00:11:00.895 --> 00:11:03.523
<i>Good luck, Ethan, and thanks again.</i>

161
00:11:19.414 --> 00:11:20.665
<i>Am I ready?</i>

162
00:11:33.052 --> 00:11:35.513
- You okay?
- Yeah.

163
00:11:37.348 --> 00:11:38.641
Yeah.

164
00:11:51.863 --> 00:11:56.242
You know, I'm sorry. I realized
i didn't tell you that the office called

165
00:11:57.118 --> 00:11:59.537
during the party.
I have to go to Houston for a night.

166
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.541
Metro's having
a public transpo conference.

167
00:12:06.586 --> 00:12:10.131
- It's so last-minute.
- I know.

168
00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:38.493
Well, well, well.

169
00:12:38.576 --> 00:12:42.246
Now, if it isn't
Mr. "those who can't do, teach"

170
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.873
back in the field.

171
00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:46.167
- What's up, baby?
- Hey, man.

172
00:12:47.001 --> 00:12:50.588
Hey, Ethan, don't worry.
We're going to get the girl.

173
00:12:51.089 --> 00:12:54.842
Or have you been away so long
you've forgotten how good we are?

174
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.678
Welcome back, brother.

175
00:13:21.619 --> 00:13:23.579
Is our truck in place?

176
00:13:23.663 --> 00:13:24.789
Weapons good to go?

177
00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:26.624
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

178
00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:28.709
You know I got your six.

179
00:13:28.793 --> 00:13:31.254
Hey, man. That's your job.

180
00:13:53.025 --> 00:13:55.653
<i>Guns one, activated.
Guns two, activated.</i>

181
00:13:55.736 --> 00:13:58.781
<i>Guns three, activated.
Guns four, activated.</i>

182
00:13:59.782 --> 00:14:01.242
<i>Guns ready.</i>

183
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:09.125
All four guns operational.

184
00:14:09.208 --> 00:14:12.920
They've got men on
the second, third, fourth floors.

185
00:14:13.588 --> 00:14:15.423
<i>I count 14 of them.</i>

186
00:14:16.507 --> 00:14:18.634
Observer, I'm in approach position.

187
00:14:18.718 --> 00:14:20.636
Roger that. Stand by.

188
00:14:25.766 --> 00:14:27.018
<i>Target match.</i>

189
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:30.021
The prize is on the sixth floor.
Two tangos with her.

190
00:14:30.354 --> 00:14:31.731
Moving in.

191
00:14:48.789 --> 00:14:50.374
<i>So, raider one, at some point,</i>

192
00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:52.877
we got to go over
this whole "getting married" thing.

193
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.795
Negative, observer.

194
00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:57.715
I don't respect you nearly enough
to have that conversation.

195
00:14:57.798 --> 00:14:58.966
<i>You may not respect me,</i>

196
00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.219
<i>but for now you're stuck
with my voice in your head.</i>

197
00:15:01.302 --> 00:15:04.222
So, this girl,
what the hell do you see in her anyway?

198
00:15:04.305 --> 00:15:07.517
Who, Julia? You've never met her.

199
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.520
Yeah, and the way things are,
i probably never will.

200
00:15:10.686 --> 00:15:13.689
<i>Lucky for her, right?
That's what you're thinking.</i>

201
00:15:14.148 --> 00:15:15.608
They've got communications gear.

202
00:15:15.691 --> 00:15:18.694
Two tangos, second floor,
northwest corridor.

203
00:15:19.028 --> 00:15:20.488
Groundhog, that's you.

204
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:22.240
<i>You need to grab that gear
on the second floor</i>

205
00:15:22.323 --> 00:15:23.699
<i>as soon as we go hot.</i>

206
00:15:23.783 --> 00:15:26.327
Copy that. I'll need two minutes,

207
00:15:26.744 --> 00:15:28.162
which means
you'll need me in one, right?

208
00:15:28.246 --> 00:15:29.872
Yeah, just about.

209
00:15:29.956 --> 00:15:32.291
Raider one,
make a left at the top of the stairs.

210
00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:35.378
<i>The prize should be
at the end of the hall.</i>

211
00:15:53.854 --> 00:15:56.023
Phoenix, I have eye on the prize.

212
00:15:56.107 --> 00:15:58.067
Give her 1 o c:C:'S more.

213
00:16:03.114 --> 00:16:05.491
- Call me when she wakes.
- Okay.

214
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.202
We need touchdown in less than three.
Do you copy?

215
00:16:08.286 --> 00:16:09.745
<i>Roger that, I copy.</i>

216
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:12.915
Please, when do I not copy?
All I do is copy.

217
00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:19.630
Stand by to go live. On my mark.

218
00:16:20.673 --> 00:16:21.841
<i>Three.</i>

219
00:16:21.924 --> 00:16:23.009
<i>Two.</i>

220
00:16:23.092 --> 00:16:24.844
One. Execute.

221
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.771
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

222
00:16:56.417 --> 00:16:58.419
Raider one, you're clear. Move!

223
00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:08.262
Lindsey. Lindsey.

224
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.182
Ethan?

225
00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:14.852
I'm going to get you home.

226
00:17:19.357 --> 00:17:21.609
Observer, I've got the prize.
Evac in three.

227
00:17:21.692 --> 00:17:23.194
<i>Roger that.</i>

228
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.870
This is adrenaline.
Lindsey, you're going to feel this.

229
00:17:49.553 --> 00:17:51.889
<i>Groundhog, second floor is clear.</i>

230
00:17:51.972 --> 00:17:53.474
On the move!

231
00:18:15.413 --> 00:18:18.416
Observer, we're on the move. Wrap out.

232
00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:20.668
- Evac <i>in 90 seconds.
- Roger that.</i>

233
00:18:20.751 --> 00:18:22.586
Phoenix, get to the lz now.

234
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.880
Roger, observer. On my way.

235
00:18:41.689 --> 00:18:43.691
Ethan. I have to talk to you.

236
00:18:43.774 --> 00:18:45.693
- Come on, come on.
- I have to talk to you right now!

237
00:18:45.776 --> 00:18:48.946
Just for you. Turn off your transmitter.

238
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.615
Do it, Ethan!

239
00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:03.294
Ethan!

240
00:19:12.303 --> 00:19:14.638
.Lind$ev! Moving!
-Lvioving!

241
00:19:26.817 --> 00:19:27.985
Mag!

242
00:19:29.403 --> 00:19:30.946
Ready to move.

243
00:19:55.471 --> 00:19:56.847
We evac from here.

244
00:19:57.014 --> 00:19:58.349
Get down!

245
00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:07.274
I'm out. How many rounds you got?

246
00:20:09.652 --> 00:20:10.945
Enough.

247
00:20:21.872 --> 00:20:23.207
Now I'm out.

248
00:20:26.544 --> 00:20:28.045
T minus five, baby.

249
00:20:40.599 --> 00:20:42.685
Lindsey, hold on to me.

250
00:21:04.039 --> 00:21:05.291
Luther!

251
00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:07.418
Rolling!

252
00:21:33.444 --> 00:21:36.447
God! My head! What is that?

253
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.324
- What is...
-Ls she okay?

254
00:21:38.407 --> 00:21:40.534
Lindsey! Let's get to the chopper.

255
00:21:40.618 --> 00:21:42.202
Zhen, get rid of the truck.

256
00:21:42.286 --> 00:21:43.621
Let's go!

257
00:21:50.252 --> 00:21:53.005
God! What is that? You can't hear that?

258
00:21:53.464 --> 00:21:55.925
- Oh! God!
- What's wrong with her?

259
00:21:57.468 --> 00:21:58.719
- Let's go!
- We loaded?

260
00:21:58.802 --> 00:22:01.138
Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!

261
00:22:06.602 --> 00:22:08.479
Go, go, go, go, 90!

262
00:22:30.167 --> 00:22:32.002
- Son of a bitch.
- No!

263
00:22:32.086 --> 00:22:35.422
Guys, we got company.
I'm going to try and lose them.

264
00:22:35.506 --> 00:22:37.091
Hurts so much.

265
00:22:38.258 --> 00:22:40.427
Turn it off. Please.

266
00:22:57.319 --> 00:22:58.988
Please, Ethan.

267
00:23:09.999 --> 00:23:12.292
Guys, their missiles are hot!

268
00:23:17.006 --> 00:23:18.799
Incoming! Hold on.

269
00:23:30.185 --> 00:23:32.896
Okay. That was lucky.
We only get one of those.

270
00:23:42.072 --> 00:23:44.241
Do we have a defibrillator?

271
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.203
Ethan, turn it off!

272
00:23:48.662 --> 00:23:50.164
Bring it on!

273
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:55.461
Ethan! What is it?
Did they put something in my head?

274
00:23:55.544 --> 00:23:57.504
They injected you
with a time-release charge.

275
00:23:57.588 --> 00:23:59.131
- Do you remember that?
- No. Time-release...

276
00:23:59.214 --> 00:24:00.591
An explosive. They've activated it.

277
00:24:00.674 --> 00:24:02.092
It's gonna detonate
unless we fry the charge,

278
00:24:02.176 --> 00:24:03.343
-which is what we're gonna do.
- No, Ethan.

279
00:24:03.427 --> 00:24:04.845
Zap her like that, you'll stop her heart.

280
00:24:04.928 --> 00:24:07.514
Then I'll zap her again
and bring her back.

281
00:24:07.598 --> 00:24:08.682
Do it!

282
00:24:08.766 --> 00:24:10.934
Guys! They're firing another one!

283
00:24:18.692 --> 00:24:20.360
- Ethan!
- Zhen!

284
00:24:20.444 --> 00:24:22.946
Zhen, hold on. Hold on, hold on!

285
00:24:45.928 --> 00:24:47.638
- I want you to set it for 150.
-150.

286
00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:49.473
Lindsey, I'm gonna short out
the explosive in your head.

287
00:24:49.556 --> 00:24:51.975
- You're gonna be okay.
- It'll need 30 seconds.

288
00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:54.144
Damn it.

289
00:24:54.603 --> 00:24:56.396
- Twenty-five seconds!
- Come on.

290
00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.315
We're almost there.

291
00:25:01.902 --> 00:25:03.904
- They have us locked.
- Twenty seconds.

292
00:25:05.572 --> 00:25:06.824
Hold on.

293
00:25:23.966 --> 00:25:25.175
I got them!

294
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.761
- Ten seconds.
- Almost there. Almost there.

295
00:25:27.928 --> 00:25:29.429
Give me the paddles.

296
00:25:29.513 --> 00:25:32.015
Ethan. Thank you.

297
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.343
Shit.

298
00:26:45.464 --> 00:26:46.590
Hey.

299
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.468
Hey.

300
00:26:57.059 --> 00:26:58.602
How did it go?

301
00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.108
I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.

302
00:27:05.692 --> 00:27:07.319
I'm just tired.

303
00:27:36.265 --> 00:27:38.934
<i>I read your training brief
on agent farris.</i>

304
00:27:39.017 --> 00:27:41.478
The words you used were
"beyond capable."

305
00:27:41.561 --> 00:27:42.938
That still stand, Mr. hunt?

306
00:27:43.021 --> 00:27:45.399
- Mr. brassel...
- Does it stand?

307
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:47.359
Yes, sir, it does.

308
00:27:47.442 --> 00:27:50.696
Because we've got a corpse downstairs
that says otherwise.

309
00:27:50.779 --> 00:27:52.489
Killed by a detonator

310
00:27:52.572 --> 00:27:55.826
implanted in her skull
through the nasal cavity.

311
00:27:56.952 --> 00:28:00.122
Mr. brassel, it's unacceptable to judge
agent farris' competence based...

312
00:28:00.205 --> 00:28:02.332
It's unacceptable
that chocolate makes you fat,

313
00:28:02.416 --> 00:28:04.459
but I've eaten my share.
And guess what?

314
00:28:04.543 --> 00:28:06.920
Now, I approved agent farris'
surveillance op

315
00:28:07.004 --> 00:28:09.172
based on your evaluations, Mr. hunt,

316
00:28:09.256 --> 00:28:11.675
of a woman
who allowed herself to be captured.

317
00:28:11.758 --> 00:28:14.761
So you go to recover her.
You encounter a dozen men.

318
00:28:14.845 --> 00:28:16.513
You don't grab any of them?

319
00:28:16.596 --> 00:28:20.267
Our objective, Mr. brassel,
was to recover agent farris.

320
00:28:21.184 --> 00:28:23.353
Davian employs a cellular structure
at his organization.

321
00:28:23.437 --> 00:28:25.522
The men there
more than likely had no information...

322
00:28:25.605 --> 00:28:28.650
Who's drawing these conclusions?
Ls it you?

323
00:28:28.734 --> 00:28:31.903
- I am, sir. Based upon...
-L'm not on you yet.

324
00:28:32.612 --> 00:28:35.115
You allowed farris
to board your chopper without a scan.

325
00:28:35.198 --> 00:28:37.284
That explosive device
could have taken you all out.

326
00:28:37.367 --> 00:28:41.872
There is one reason that you are sitting
here before me today, and that is luck.

327
00:28:41.955 --> 00:28:46.251
Because your operation was
poorly conceived and executed worse.

328
00:28:46.335 --> 00:28:48.670
- Two laptops were recovered...
-L'm aware of that.

329
00:28:48.754 --> 00:28:50.130
We've talked to tech services.

330
00:28:50.213 --> 00:28:52.591
They doubt
if they can reconstitute the drives.

331
00:28:52.674 --> 00:28:55.969
"Crispy," I believe,
is what they called them. Worthless.

332
00:28:56.053 --> 00:28:58.347
Mr. brassel,
as operation manager of this office,

333
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:59.890
- I have the authority...
- Excuse me.

334
00:28:59.973 --> 00:29:03.060
Did you just throw a title at me,
Mr. musgrave?

335
00:29:03.143 --> 00:29:06.521
I don't care if your daddy plays golf
with the president.

336
00:29:06.605 --> 00:29:09.733
This is intelligence.
So far I haven't seen any.

337
00:29:09.816 --> 00:29:12.986
You think this op was worth the risk,
Mr. hunt.

338
00:29:13.904 --> 00:29:16.531
What do you know about Owen Davian?

339
00:29:17.574 --> 00:29:20.118
He was the one
who brought gas centrifuge technology

340
00:29:20.202 --> 00:29:22.287
to Korea from Pakistan.

341
00:29:22.371 --> 00:29:26.583
He was also the man who sold toxin
five to the armahad Republic jihad.

342
00:29:26.958 --> 00:29:31.254
He is a man who provides,
provides, provides!

343
00:29:32.547 --> 00:29:36.259
And he remains invisible.
He's a goddamn invisible man.

344
00:29:36.343 --> 00:29:39.304
Wells, not Ellison,
in case you want to be cute again.

345
00:29:39.388 --> 00:29:41.181
We can't find him.

346
00:29:42.307 --> 00:29:45.769
He knows it. It's emboldened him.

347
00:29:47.062 --> 00:29:49.648
I've been trying to bring Davian down
since the day that I got here.

348
00:29:49.731 --> 00:29:50.941
Do you know what I've got for it?

349
00:29:51.024 --> 00:29:53.276
It's never been confirmed
the toxin five theft was Davian.

350
00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.406
Mr. musgrave, please don't interrupt me
when I'm asking rhetorical questions.

351
00:29:57.489 --> 00:29:59.616
Your operation has achieved one thing.

352
00:29:59.699 --> 00:30:02.953
You have reminded Davian
that he is winning.

353
00:30:04.413 --> 00:30:07.416
And now, if you'll excuse me,
i have to go inform Mr. and Mrs. farris

354
00:30:07.499 --> 00:30:11.420
that their baby girl was killed
in a head-on collision on i-95.

355
00:30:13.463 --> 00:30:16.007
<i>I stand here today deeply saddened</i>

356
00:30:16.299 --> 00:30:19.094
by the death of one of god's children,

357
00:30:19.594 --> 00:30:21.930
Lindsey Elizabeth farris.

358
00:30:22.639 --> 00:30:27.477
It is always startling when the lord
takes one of our young so unexpectedly.

359
00:30:28.562 --> 00:30:33.650
<i>Be aggressive. Come on. Stay focused.
Keep your knees bent. Good. Good.</i>

360
00:30:33.733 --> 00:30:35.819
<i>Now, to fire the lock,
the extractor has to be...</i>

361
00:30:35.902 --> 00:30:37.863
<i>That bag's not going to hit you back.
Hit harder.</i>

362
00:30:37.946 --> 00:30:40.365
<i>Don't rely on your sights.
Keep your eyes dead on the target...</i>

363
00:30:40.449 --> 00:30:42.075
<i>Attack me. Come on.</i>

364
00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:45.287
<i>Don't ever release the firing pin
unless the extractors.</i> ..

365
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.497
<i>Good. There you go. Good.</i>

366
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:52.085
<i>Identify the target. Point and shoot.
It's very simple. You point and shoot.</i>

367
00:30:52.169 --> 00:30:53.253
<i>Stay focused.</i>

368
00:30:53.336 --> 00:30:56.381
<i>Miss farris, you know
how many recruits I've trained.</i>

369
00:30:56.465 --> 00:30:58.341
<i>I'm proud to say that you are the first</i>

370
00:30:58.425 --> 00:31:01.094
<i>that I've recommended
for active field duty.</i>

371
00:31:01.178 --> 00:31:02.554
<i>Congratulations.</i>

372
00:31:02.637 --> 00:31:04.055
<i>Am I ready?</i>

373
00:31:10.228 --> 00:31:11.354
Yes?

374
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.523
<i>Is this Mr. Kelvin?</i>

375
00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:17.944
Yes. Who is this?

376
00:31:18.487 --> 00:31:20.363
<i>L'm calling from Norfolk mail service.</i>

377
00:31:20.447 --> 00:31:22.908
<i>Lindsey farris
rents a post office box here.</i>

378
00:31:22.991 --> 00:31:24.618
<i>She sent you a piece of mail from Berlin</i>

379
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:26.620
<i>and asked us to call you
when it arrived.</i>

380
00:31:26.703 --> 00:31:28.622
<i>It came this morning.</i>

381
00:31:32.918 --> 00:31:34.336
Thank you.

382
00:31:38.089 --> 00:31:40.217
- This right here.
- Thanks.

383
00:31:57.609 --> 00:31:58.944
<i>It's a microdot.</i>

384
00:31:59.027 --> 00:32:01.321
A microdot with nothing on it.
This is unusual.

385
00:32:01.404 --> 00:32:03.448
Lindsey wouldn't send me
a blank microdot.

386
00:32:03.532 --> 00:32:05.116
I'm telling you, man, there's no image.

387
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.535
Then you're not looking
in the right place.

388
00:32:06.618 --> 00:32:08.119
Where the hell am I supposed to look?

389
00:32:08.203 --> 00:32:09.663
There's not much square footage
to this thing.

390
00:32:09.746 --> 00:32:11.206
Why would Lindsey send me
a blank microdot?

391
00:32:11.289 --> 00:32:13.083
I don't know.
Why would Lindsey send you anything?

392
00:32:13.166 --> 00:32:15.877
You were her instructor,
not her handler.

393
00:32:16.545 --> 00:32:19.589
Listen, man.
I don't mean to cross the line,

394
00:32:20.382 --> 00:32:23.635
but was there something going on
between you two?

395
00:32:23.718 --> 00:32:25.428
You and Lindsey.

396
00:32:25.929 --> 00:32:28.473
Lindsey was like my little sister.

397
00:32:29.015 --> 00:32:30.517
And you never

398
00:32:31.518 --> 00:32:34.354
slept with your little sister, right?

399
00:32:37.357 --> 00:32:40.110
Hey, brother,
if I don't ask you, who will?

400
00:32:40.193 --> 00:32:42.737
Maybe it's magnetic. The microdot.

401
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.240
Well, that's old school.

402
00:32:45.323 --> 00:32:48.827
If she was in a hurry and only had
access to black-market gear, maybe.

403
00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.162
- Could you get the tools to read it?
- I might know a guy.

404
00:32:51.246 --> 00:32:53.665
- Magnetic means encrypted.
- Yeah, I know that.

405
00:32:53.748 --> 00:32:56.293
Yeah. Be right there.

406
00:32:56.793 --> 00:32:59.588
The thing about Lindsey is
she was brand-new.

407
00:32:59.838 --> 00:33:03.008
She was sweet.
Remember when you were sweet?

408
00:33:03.091 --> 00:33:06.636
- Can you remember that far back?
- Yeah, well, barely.

409
00:33:07.012 --> 00:33:10.515
In Germany,
you asked me what it is I see in Julia.

410
00:33:10.974 --> 00:33:14.060
What I see in Julia
is life before all this.

411
00:33:14.811 --> 00:33:16.521
And it's good.

412
00:33:18.815 --> 00:33:20.275
Benji, what have you got?

413
00:33:20.358 --> 00:33:22.611
Well, these hard drive platters
are just fried.

414
00:33:22.694 --> 00:33:24.487
- Yeah.
- You know, they made a mess of them.

415
00:33:24.571 --> 00:33:25.989
It's just like...
There's holes in them and stuff.

416
00:33:26.072 --> 00:33:27.991
And it's got scorched
all the way through. And then...

417
00:33:28.074 --> 00:33:29.659
Look, this one's got
a hole in it and stuff.

418
00:33:29.743 --> 00:33:31.036
I can't believe. I can't even look at it.

419
00:33:31.119 --> 00:33:33.330
- Benji. Did you recover anything?
- Yes. Yes.

420
00:33:33.413 --> 00:33:36.333
Despite the aforementioned conditions
of the hard drive you brought back,

421
00:33:36.416 --> 00:33:41.004
I managed to recover
portions of two dozen e-mail files.

422
00:33:41.087 --> 00:33:42.631
Also made what I believe to be

423
00:33:42.714 --> 00:33:45.717
a thoroughly
promotion-worthy breakthrough.

424
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:49.596
Your Mr. Davian is going
to arrive in Rome the day after tomorrow

425
00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:52.766
and attend a function
at one Vatican city.

426
00:33:52.849 --> 00:33:55.018
What the hell is Davian
doing at the Vatican?

427
00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:57.145
It's all got to do
with the "rabbit's foot."

428
00:33:57.228 --> 00:33:58.355
Rabbit's foot?

429
00:33:58.438 --> 00:34:00.148
Yeah, well,
I'm assuming it's like a code word

430
00:34:00.231 --> 00:34:02.400
for something he's about to sell
to an unspecified buyer,

431
00:34:02.484 --> 00:34:06.112
for $850 million, by the way.
Or maybe it's not a code word.

432
00:34:06.196 --> 00:34:08.907
Maybe it's just a really,
really expensive bunny appendage.

433
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:10.533
You have no idea what it is?

434
00:34:10.617 --> 00:34:13.370
It's interesting. I used to have
this professor at Oxford, okay?

435
00:34:13.453 --> 00:34:16.581
Dr. wickham, his name was,
and he was like this massive, fat guy.

436
00:34:16.665 --> 00:34:19.042
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...

437
00:34:19.125 --> 00:34:20.919
You know... well, I won't tell you
what we used to call him.

438
00:34:21.002 --> 00:34:23.755
He taught biomolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,

439
00:34:23.838 --> 00:34:25.882
and he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen

440
00:34:25.965 --> 00:34:29.135
with this story about how the world
would eventually be eviscerated

441
00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:30.595
by technology.

442
00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:34.182
You see, it was inevitable
that a compound would be created,

443
00:34:34.265 --> 00:34:36.810
which he referred to as the "anti-god."

444
00:34:36.893 --> 00:34:39.145
It was like an accelerated mutator,
a sort of, you know,

445
00:34:39.229 --> 00:34:42.357
like an unstoppable force
of destructive power

446
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.192
that would just lay waste to everything.

447
00:34:44.275 --> 00:34:46.486
To buildings and parks
and streets and children

448
00:34:46.569 --> 00:34:49.114
and ice cream parlors, you know?

449
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.075
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organization,

450
00:34:52.158 --> 00:34:55.870
willing to spend this amount of money
on a mystery tech,

451
00:34:56.454 --> 00:34:59.332
I always assume it's the anti-god.

452
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.712
End-of-the-world kind of stuff,
you know?

453
00:35:05.422 --> 00:35:08.591
But, no, I don't have any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.

454
00:35:08.675 --> 00:35:11.052
- Did you brief musgrave on this?
- Who, me? No, not yet.

455
00:35:11.136 --> 00:35:12.846
- Good. Don't.
- What?

456
00:35:12.929 --> 00:35:14.681
- Don't tell anyone about this.
- This took me ages.

457
00:35:14.764 --> 00:35:16.182
If something goes wrong
with the operation,

458
00:35:16.266 --> 00:35:18.727
I want musgrave to have deniability.

459
00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.438
- That's great work, Benji.
- What operation?

460
00:35:22.772 --> 00:35:24.691
That look in your eye
is a pain in my ass.

461
00:35:24.774 --> 00:35:26.693
You know that, right?

462
00:35:27.777 --> 00:35:30.613
<i>Any available resident to pediatrics.</i>

463
00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:33.992
<i>Any available resident to pediatrics.</i>

464
00:35:35.869 --> 00:35:38.663
<i>Rehabilitative care, call the pharmacy.</i>

465
00:35:40.457 --> 00:35:42.459
<i>Rehabilitative care, call the...</i>

466
00:35:43.376 --> 00:35:45.462
I have to go away again.

467
00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:49.966
On business. Two days.

468
00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:52.635
Two days?

469
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.888
Yeah.

470
00:36:01.478 --> 00:36:03.480
Ethan, what's going on?

471
00:36:05.148 --> 00:36:07.692
I keep thinking you just need time

472
00:36:10.153 --> 00:36:13.031
to tell me whatever it is that it's...

473
00:36:16.993 --> 00:36:19.662
But nothing in my mind makes sense.

474
00:36:22.332 --> 00:36:23.500
Yeah.

475
00:36:27.504 --> 00:36:29.047
What's wrong?

476
00:36:37.013 --> 00:36:39.307
What are you not telling me?

477
00:37:05.917 --> 00:37:08.211
I need to ask you for something.

478
00:37:08.336 --> 00:37:10.755
And it's the most...

479
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.058
I need you to trust me.

480
00:37:24.727 --> 00:37:26.604
Of course I trust you.

481
00:37:31.067 --> 00:37:34.696
Am I ever going to be able
to understand what this is?

482
00:37:38.074 --> 00:37:40.118
I need you to trust me.

483
00:37:46.249 --> 00:37:47.417
Yes.

484
00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:50.253
I trust you.

485
00:37:53.423 --> 00:37:54.632
Is it...

486
00:37:55.633 --> 00:37:57.427
Tell me it's real.

487
00:38:02.932 --> 00:38:04.309
I mean us.

488
00:38:05.894 --> 00:38:07.604
Tell me it's real.

489
00:38:10.398 --> 00:38:11.774
Follow me.

490
00:38:13.234 --> 00:38:14.652
<i>The vows you're about to take</i>

491
00:38:14.736 --> 00:38:18.323
are not to be taken
without careful thought and prayer.

492
00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:23.369
This love is not to be diminished
by difficult circumstances

493
00:38:23.453 --> 00:38:26.623
and it is only to be dissolved by death.

494
00:38:28.583 --> 00:38:30.460
Do you have the rings?

495
00:38:30.752 --> 00:38:31.920
Yeah.

496
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:48.019
Repeat after me.

497
00:38:54.817 --> 00:38:57.111
I, Julia Anne Meade...

498
00:38:58.279 --> 00:39:01.366
"I, Julia Anne Meade..."

499
00:39:01.824 --> 00:39:04.953
...hereby take Ethan Matthew hunt...

500
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:08.665
"...hereby take Ethan Matthew hunt..."

501
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:11.459
...to be my lawfully wedded husband.

502
00:39:11.709 --> 00:39:14.504
"...to be my lawfully wedded husband."

503
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:33.815
Tomorrow may be the only time
we can predict

504
00:39:33.898 --> 00:39:35.483
where Owen Davian is going to be.

505
00:39:35.566 --> 00:39:37.110
Charity event. Vatican city.

506
00:39:37.193 --> 00:39:40.238
Our mission is to get in
and kidnap Davian.

507
00:39:40.363 --> 00:39:42.740
I don't know why he's so happy.

508
00:39:43.032 --> 00:39:46.369
I did remind him
that the Vatican is the Vatican.

509
00:39:46.661 --> 00:39:50.540
A 109-acre sovereign state
in the middle of Rome,

510
00:39:50.665 --> 00:39:54.252
surrounded by a 60-foot wall,
which is monitored 24/7,

511
00:39:54.377 --> 00:39:56.838
with over 200 cctv cameras.

512
00:39:58.047 --> 00:40:00.425
That's not even
what makes it a challenge.

513
00:40:00.508 --> 00:40:04.721
Getting Davian is good.
But getting his buyers is even better.

514
00:40:05.388 --> 00:40:08.891
If they realize he's been grabbed,
they'll disappear.

515
00:40:09.017 --> 00:40:11.060
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

516
00:40:11.185 --> 00:40:12.478
No matter how we grab Davian,

517
00:40:12.562 --> 00:40:14.439
his clients are gonna know
he's been taken.

518
00:40:14.522 --> 00:40:17.400
No, they won't. Access point is here.

519
00:40:17.734 --> 00:40:20.778
It's a one-way street
adjacent to the Vatican wall.

520
00:40:20.903 --> 00:40:24.073
I'll need 30 seconds.
And we'll need a truck.

521
00:41:01.152 --> 00:41:02.737
Now we've pissed off
every Italian in Rome,

522
00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.905
go do what you got to do.

523
00:41:03.988 --> 00:41:06.407
- Don't forget the smoke.
- Yeah.

524
00:41:48.491 --> 00:41:49.826
"Humpty dumpty sat on a wall."

525
00:43:04.066 --> 00:43:06.777
Alpha team, this is bravo.
Right on schedule.

526
00:43:07.612 --> 00:43:09.697
<i>We should have breach in 60.</i>

527
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.450
Roger that. Charlie team, report.

528
00:43:13.034 --> 00:43:15.077
<i>Well, I don't have anything
to report, really.</i>

529
00:43:18.331 --> 00:43:20.333
Except I think I should be right on time.

530
00:43:20.416 --> 00:43:21.500
We'll be waiting for you.

531
00:43:21.584 --> 00:43:24.337
<i>- Eta two minutes.
- Roger that.</i>

532
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:57.578
Charlie team, did you fire the tracer yet?

533
00:43:58.913 --> 00:44:00.289
Stand by.

534
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.223
Firing the tracer. Now.

535
00:44:22.979 --> 00:44:26.148
<i>Alpha, I'm in. T minus two minutes.</i>

536
00:44:26.274 --> 00:44:27.650
Roger that.

537
00:44:30.444 --> 00:44:31.654
Charlie team, I see you.

538
00:44:32.154 --> 00:44:34.532
<i>I'm looping the security feed.
Stand by to move.</i>

539
00:44:34.615 --> 00:44:35.992
Roger that.

540
00:44:37.743 --> 00:44:39.161
Video is looped. Go.

541
00:44:53.259 --> 00:44:55.594
Alpha team,
catacomb video taken care of?

542
00:44:55.678 --> 00:44:57.763
Taken care of. We're good to go.

543
00:45:06.188 --> 00:45:09.608
<i>- Delta team, do you copy?
- All I do is copy.</i>

544
00:45:09.859 --> 00:45:13.195
That's funny.
Get ready to move into position.

545
00:45:13.321 --> 00:45:15.781
<i>- L'm already there.
- Really?</i>

546
00:45:18.367 --> 00:45:19.952
<i>Eta 30 seconds.</i>

547
00:45:20.036 --> 00:45:21.662
See you in 30.

548
00:45:31.172 --> 00:45:32.631
Alpha team moving into position.

549
00:45:32.715 --> 00:45:34.550
Bravo standing by for transmission.

550
00:45:36.552 --> 00:45:37.720
Transmitting.

551
00:45:41.057 --> 00:45:42.391
Got you.

552
00:45:57.156 --> 00:45:58.657
Miss onia demea.

553
00:45:58.866 --> 00:46:01.369
I should be on the list. Thank you.

554
00:46:02.536 --> 00:46:03.829
I'm sorry. Your name is not here.

555
00:46:03.913 --> 00:46:05.790
There must be some mistake.

556
00:46:14.715 --> 00:46:15.800
Miss demea?

557
00:46:17.051 --> 00:46:18.135
Just a minute.

558
00:46:54.296 --> 00:46:55.798
She made it.

559
00:47:17.319 --> 00:47:18.779
We have a photo opportunity.

560
00:47:19.238 --> 00:47:21.907
<i>Just give me the word. I'm standing by.</i>

561
00:47:21.991 --> 00:47:23.659
Delta, ready for upload.

562
00:47:40.593 --> 00:47:42.678
Delta team, download good.

563
00:47:53.856 --> 00:47:56.609
Listen, man, I didn't mean to be
so cavalier the other day

564
00:47:56.692 --> 00:47:58.235
about you getting engaged.

565
00:47:58.319 --> 00:48:00.988
I know that. Thanks.

566
00:48:03.866 --> 00:48:07.036
But a normal relationship
isn't viable for people like us.

567
00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:09.955
- I don't agree with that.
- Then I'm smarter than you.

568
00:48:10.039 --> 00:48:12.541
I'm going up. I agree with Luther.

569
00:48:12.666 --> 00:48:16.629
We can't have real relationships.
But you see, I love that.

570
00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:43.781
Twenty-three months.
That's as long as it'll last

571
00:48:43.864 --> 00:48:46.825
when you got the baggage we do
and the lifestyle we got.

572
00:48:46.909 --> 00:48:48.911
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

573
00:48:49.912 --> 00:48:52.748
Look at me.
I know what I'm talking about.

574
00:48:52.873 --> 00:48:55.834
And you know
i know what I'm talking about.

575
00:49:08.013 --> 00:49:09.390
Wait here.

576
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:32.705
Davian just picked up a briefcase.

577
00:49:32.788 --> 00:49:34.540
We're going to have to
move sooner than we thought.

578
00:49:34.623 --> 00:49:38.502
- Can <i>you identify who made the</i> drop?
<i>- Negative. How close are you guys?</i>

579
00:49:38.586 --> 00:49:40.671
We're just printing now.

580
00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.234
I'm not proud of it.
I'm not happy about it,

581
00:50:02.318 --> 00:50:04.153
but I've lived with women a few times,

582
00:50:04.236 --> 00:50:06.363
and it doesn't ever make it to two years.

583
00:50:06.447 --> 00:50:08.240
- You can't.
- Thanks for the advice,

584
00:50:08.324 --> 00:50:10.868
but it's different for me
than it is for you, you know?

585
00:50:10.951 --> 00:50:12.953
-L'm not in the field anymore.
- Oh, okay.

586
00:50:13.037 --> 00:50:15.289
Here's a retirement present.

587
00:50:18.375 --> 00:50:22.004
In our job, there's always going to be
something between you and a woman.

588
00:50:22.087 --> 00:50:23.297
Always.

589
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.633
- Luther, listen.
- Dishonesty.

590
00:50:25.716 --> 00:50:28.427
A dishonesty that poisons everything.

591
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:30.179
I think I need to tell you something...

592
00:50:30.262 --> 00:50:33.182
Stop talking. This isn't about you, Ethan.

593
00:50:33.849 --> 00:50:37.853
And whoever this girl is, you're going to
end up messing up her life, too.

594
00:50:37.936 --> 00:50:39.396
Don't do it.

595
00:50:40.773 --> 00:50:43.525
Jules and I got married two days ago.

596
00:50:45.611 --> 00:50:47.279
Congratulations.

597
00:50:48.238 --> 00:50:50.699
Thanks. Thanks.

598
00:50:55.412 --> 00:50:58.290
- He's walking. I'm going in.
- Roger <i>that.</i>

599
00:50:59.416 --> 00:51:01.001
I'm on my way.

600
00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:07.549
Ma'am. I need you to step back.

601
00:51:07.633 --> 00:51:09.551
No. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

602
00:51:09.635 --> 00:51:12.054
I always spill red wine
on my white custom-made shirt.

603
00:51:12.137 --> 00:51:15.474
- Okay. Step back.
-Lt's fine. It's fine. Bathroom.

604
00:51:18.185 --> 00:51:19.645
Tell me you're on your way.

605
00:51:19.728 --> 00:51:21.438
I'm on the move.

606
00:51:30.489 --> 00:51:31.657
Move it. Come on.

607
00:51:35.202 --> 00:51:37.246
His bodyguards
are checking out the bathroom.

608
00:51:37.913 --> 00:51:39.623
I'm almost there.

609
00:52:20.414 --> 00:52:21.582
He's going in.

610
00:52:48.942 --> 00:52:51.528
Quiet. Read this.

611
00:52:51.653 --> 00:52:52.946
Slowly.

612
00:52:54.865 --> 00:52:56.158
Read it.

613
00:52:57.951 --> 00:53:01.330

626
00:53:38.534 --> 00:53:40.077

Sir, is everything all right?

00:53:52.881 --> 00:53:55.425
Everything is not all right.

I'm fine. Wait outside.

00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:44.474
See you in the sewer.

637
00:54:52.274 --> 00:54:55.611
- She's sorry about your shirt.
- That's no problem.

638
00:54:58.906 --> 00:55:02.242
Her hotel has laundry service,
and she'll happily take care of it.

639
00:55:02.326 --> 00:55:03.660
You want to wash my shirt?

640
00:55:03.744 --> 00:55:06.288
What are we going to do
while we're waiting in your hotel room,

641
00:55:06.371 --> 00:55:07.706
and I'm not wearing my shirt?

642
00:55:11.877 --> 00:55:13.795
She'll think of something.

643
00:55:14.713 --> 00:55:16.340
She would like to drive.

644
00:55:16.423 --> 00:55:17.966
Follow me to the hotel.

645
00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:19.885
Sir, would you like us
to watch the case?

646
00:55:19.968 --> 00:55:21.053
No.

00:55:22.387 --> 00:55:24.264
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

648
00:56:02.636 --> 00:56:05.138
- What's up?
- Nothing. What's up with you?

649
00:56:05.222 --> 00:56:06.515
Nothing.

650
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:26.243
Blow the car.

651
00:56:28.328 --> 00:56:30.372
Oh. It's such a nice car.

652
00:56:30.455 --> 00:56:32.708
And yet, do it.

Send him in.

658
00:57:07.034 --> 00:57:10.787
Ethan hunt and his team
just grabbed Owen Davian in Rome.

659
00:57:10.912 --> 00:57:14.332
They're headed back now.
I thought you should know.

660
00:57:14.958 --> 00:57:17.252
You were aware of this operation?

661
00:57:19.337 --> 00:57:20.756
Yes, I was.

662
00:57:21.673 --> 00:57:23.300
Then good work.

663
00:57:27.012 --> 00:57:28.388
Thank you.

664
00:58:02.631 --> 00:58:04.674
You're dead, Mr. Davian.

665
00:58:09.387 --> 00:58:11.264
There were witnesses.

666
00:58:14.601 --> 00:58:16.853
That was you in the bathroom.

667
00:58:16.937 --> 00:58:18.688
Now, you're going to tell us everything.

668
00:58:18.772 --> 00:58:21.316
Every buyer you've worked with.
Every organization.

669
00:58:21.399 --> 00:58:22.692
What the hell is your name?

670
00:58:22.776 --> 00:58:24.945
Names, contacts, inventory lists.

671
00:58:25.028 --> 00:58:27.906
You have a wife, girlfriend?

672
00:58:30.283 --> 00:58:32.202
It's up to you how this goes.

673
00:58:32.285 --> 00:58:35.205
Because you know
what I'm going to do next?

674
00:58:35.288 --> 00:58:37.666
I'm going to find her, whoever she is,

675
00:58:37.749 --> 00:58:41.044
I'm going to find her,
and I'm going to hurt her.

676
00:58:44.714 --> 00:58:46.675
You were apprehended carrying details

677
00:58:46.758 --> 00:58:49.803
of the location of something
code named the rabbit's foot.

678
00:58:49.886 --> 00:58:53.640
I'm going to make her bleed, and cry,
and call out your name.

679
00:58:53.723 --> 00:58:57.477
And you're not going to be
able to do shit. You know why?

680
00:58:58.979 --> 00:59:00.063
What is the rabbit's foot?

681
00:59:00.147 --> 00:59:02.440
Because you're going to be
this close to dead.

682
00:59:02.524 --> 00:59:03.692
And who is the buyer?

683
00:59:03.775 --> 00:59:07.320
And then I'm going to kill you
right in front of her.

684
00:59:08.488 --> 00:59:10.699
- L'm going to ask you one more time.
- What's your name?

685
00:59:10.782 --> 00:59:12.284
- What is the rabbit's foot?
- Who are you?

686
00:59:12.367 --> 00:59:13.451
And who is the buyer?

687
00:59:13.535 --> 00:59:15.912
You don't have any idea
what the hell is going on, do you?

688
00:59:15.996 --> 00:59:20.458
I mean, you saw what I did to your little
blonde friend at the factory, right?

689
00:59:23.503 --> 00:59:25.964
Well, that was nothing. That was

690
00:59:28.049 --> 00:59:29.217
fun.

691
00:59:33.221 --> 00:59:34.723
That was fun.

692
01:00:05.712 --> 01:00:07.839
What is the rabbit's foot?

693
01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:17.265
- Ethan!
- What is the rabbit's foot?

694
01:00:17.724 --> 01:00:19.142
Ethan, stop!

695
01:00:19.226 --> 01:00:20.685
What is it?

696
01:00:21.895 --> 01:00:23.396
Don't do it!

697
01:00:24.064 --> 01:00:26.608
- Ethan!
- What is the rabbit's foot?

698
01:00:28.652 --> 01:00:29.861
You tell me!

699
01:00:29.945 --> 01:00:31.613
Ethan, stop! Don't do it.

700
01:00:31.696 --> 01:00:33.907
This isn't you, man! This isn't you!

701
01:00:34.032 --> 01:00:36.785
We can use him, Ethan! You know that!

702
01:00:43.166 --> 01:00:45.168
No, Ethan! Don't do it!

703
01:00:46.878 --> 01:00:48.380
Please, stop!

704
01:01:19.536 --> 01:01:21.246
What I'm selling,

705
01:01:21.913 --> 01:01:23.957
and who I'm selling to,

706
01:01:26.584 --> 01:01:29.838
is the last thing
you should be concerned about,

707
01:01:32.299 --> 01:01:33.550
Ethan.

708
01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.070
Ethan, we got it. Lindsey's microdot.

709
01:02:35.528 --> 01:02:37.322
It's a video file.

710
01:02:41.618 --> 01:02:44.704
<i>Ethan, I don't know what they've
told you. I don't know what you think.</i>

711
01:02:44.788 --> 01:02:46.414
<i>Just listen to me.</i>

712
01:02:46.498 --> 01:02:49.042
<i>Brassel sent me to Germany
to surveil an exchange,</i>

713
01:02:49.125 --> 01:02:51.211
<i>to ID a man named Owen Davian.</i>

714
01:02:51.294 --> 01:02:54.047
<i>I tagged his phone,
and I intercepted a transmission.</i>

715
01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:57.509
<i>I traced the call through the
imf network, and this is what came up.</i>

716
01:02:57.592 --> 01:03:00.720
<i>The call to Davian
came from brassel's office.</i>

717
01:03:01.554 --> 01:03:04.474
<i>It's brassel.
I think he's working with Davian.</i>

718
01:03:04.557 --> 01:03:06.559
<i>I think I'm being set up...</i>

719
01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.033
Ethan!

720
01:03:54.649 --> 01:03:56.192
You all right?

721
01:04:03.783 --> 01:04:05.743
Someone call for help!

722
01:04:06.786 --> 01:04:09.122
Does anyone have a cell phone?

723
01:04:42.614 --> 01:04:44.449
Everybody, get down!

724
01:04:44.991 --> 01:04:48.328
Get down! Get down, get down!
Everybody, get down!

725
01:05:04.594 --> 01:05:07.096
- There's a woman down.
- I see her.

726
01:05:24.572 --> 01:05:26.908
Get down! Get down! Stay down!

727
01:05:28.159 --> 01:05:30.787
Everybody, get down! Get down!
Stay down!

728
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:32.247
Get down!

729
01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:36.876
Open up!

730
01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.295
Open up! I need the prisoner!

731
01:05:55.395 --> 01:05:56.813
Oh, my god!

732
01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.899
It's really bleeding.
Don't leave me, okay?

733
01:05:59.983 --> 01:06:01.943
Don't worry. I'm right here.

734
01:06:02.026 --> 01:06:04.404
Ethan, there's a g36 in the truck!

735
01:06:04.487 --> 01:06:05.572
I know! I know!

736
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:40.189
Turn the drone around.
There's an imf agent in the truck.

737
01:06:46.738 --> 01:06:48.990
Ethan! Get out of the truck!

738
01:06:56.414 --> 01:06:57.874
Ethan, move!

739
01:09:08.296 --> 01:09:10.715
- Hello?
- Rick, this is Ethan. Ls Julia home?

740
01:09:10.798 --> 01:09:13.885
Hey, man. Look, I hope you're not mad
I'm here. Lt'sjust...

741
01:09:13.968 --> 01:09:15.303
Rick, I'm not mad. Ls Julia home?

742
01:09:15.386 --> 01:09:17.346
I tried her cell phone,
and there was no answer.

743
01:09:17.889 --> 01:09:21.517
No. Sorry.
Hey, did your friend find you?

744
01:09:23.311 --> 01:09:24.729
Which friend?

745
01:09:24.812 --> 01:09:27.482
<i>I don't know. Just some English guy.</i>

746
01:09:29.734 --> 01:09:31.110
Rick, what did you tell him?

747
01:09:31.194 --> 01:09:34.071
<i>Look, it's all good, man.
I told him I didn't know where you were,</i>

748
01:09:34.155 --> 01:09:37.658
<i>and Julia might, and he should
just try her at the hospital.</i>

749
01:09:39.327 --> 01:09:40.495
Hello?

750
01:09:46.542 --> 01:09:49.170
- All right, see you tomorrow, Sally.
- All right. Good night, honey.

751
01:09:56.719 --> 01:09:59.180
<i>Hi. It's Julia.
Please leave me a message...</i>

752
01:10:06.687 --> 01:10:10.691
<i>...at 4:00 today, the chesapeake bay
bridge is closed in both directions.</i>

753
01:10:10.775 --> 01:10:12.610
- Sixth floor.
- Sally, this is Ethan.

754
01:10:12.693 --> 01:10:14.779
- I need to talk to Julia.
- Hey, honey.

755
01:10:14.862 --> 01:10:16.614
She just went downstairs.
I'll transfer you.

756
01:10:37.552 --> 01:10:38.803
Damn it!

757
01:10:39.637 --> 01:10:40.721
Excuse me.

758
01:10:40.805 --> 01:10:43.182
L was wondering if you knew
where I might find this patient.

759
01:10:43.266 --> 01:10:45.893
Probably not. But I'll know who can.

760
01:10:51.148 --> 01:10:52.650
What's that?

761
01:11:07.915 --> 01:11:09.917
Sally. Where's Julia?

762
01:11:10.418 --> 01:11:12.795
- Where's Julia?
- I think she left.

763
01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.131
Have you tried the east building?

764
01:11:21.637 --> 01:11:23.598
- Has Julia left yet?
- I haven't seen her.

765
01:11:23.681 --> 01:11:25.933
- Mike, Mike. Have you seen Julia?
- Hey, you okay?

766
01:11:26.017 --> 01:11:27.602
- Have you seen Julia?
- No.

767
01:11:32.106 --> 01:11:33.941
Watch it, buddy!

768
01:11:44.619 --> 01:11:47.204
<i>- Jules?
- You hung me outside of an airplane.</i>

769
01:11:47.288 --> 01:11:49.123
<i>You can always tell
someone's character</i>

770
01:11:49.206 --> 01:11:51.751
<i>by the way they treat those
they don't need to treat well.</i>

771
01:11:51.834 --> 01:11:55.755
<i>- If you hurt her,</i> I <i>swear...
- Don't threaten me. Just don't.</i>

772
01:11:55.838 --> 01:11:59.717
<i>The briefcase I picked up in Rome,
the one you took from me,</i>

773
01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.928
<i>contains the location
of the rabbit's foot.</i>

774
01:12:02.011 --> 01:12:05.431
<i>You're going to get it and bring it to me.
The rabbit's foot.</i>

775
01:12:05.514 --> 01:12:08.434
<i>Ethan, you had a watch
last time I saw you.</i>

776
01:12:08.517 --> 01:12:11.312
<i>You have 48 hours,
starting on my mark.</i>

777
01:12:11.395 --> 01:12:12.647
Wait, wait, wait.

778
01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:14.815
<i>Now, call me at this number
when you have it.</i>

779
01:12:14.899 --> 01:12:17.652
<i>- Just wait.
- Julia's life for the rabbit's foot.</i>

780
01:12:17.735 --> 01:12:21.155
<i>- You have 48 hours, or she dies.
- Wait! Wait. Wait.</i>

781
01:12:25.826 --> 01:12:28.162
<i>Condition 1-116. All units on scene.</i>

782
01:12:28.245 --> 01:12:30.206
We need you to come with us.

783
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:32.667
Just... Pete, what the hell is this?

784
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:35.461
Sorry about that, Mr. hunt.
We were told to bring you in.

785
01:12:35.544 --> 01:12:37.713
<i>- Okay.
- Get ready to transport.</i>

786
01:12:37.838 --> 01:12:39.590
Whoa. Hey. Just not right now.

787
01:12:39.674 --> 01:12:42.093
- Just tell them you came and that...
- Ethan. Get in.

788
01:12:42.176 --> 01:12:45.596
We don't want to use force here,
and you know we will. Ethan, get in.

789
01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.932
- Tell them that you came here...
- Ethan!

790
01:12:48.015 --> 01:12:50.184
...and that I left already, okay?

791
01:12:55.022 --> 01:12:56.273
Freeze!

792
01:12:56.524 --> 01:12:59.694
Ethan, stop! Stop, Ethan!

793
01:13:13.708 --> 01:13:15.543
Yeah. Get his hands.

794
01:13:43.404 --> 01:13:46.365
I reviewed the transcript
of your Berlin operation.

795
01:13:46.449 --> 01:13:48.367
It's very interesting.

796
01:13:48.451 --> 01:13:50.536
It seems that agent farris
had some information

797
01:13:50.619 --> 01:13:53.873
she wished to share with you
but not with this agency.

798
01:13:53.956 --> 01:13:55.750
Something you failed to report.

799
01:13:55.833 --> 01:13:59.045
You ordered the Vatican operation
without proper approvals.

800
01:13:59.128 --> 01:14:01.589
That mission
resulted in a catastrophic attack.

801
01:14:01.672 --> 01:14:03.591
And then you fled the scene.

802
01:14:03.674 --> 01:14:06.802
Now, I am not a stranger to disrespect.

803
01:14:07.595 --> 01:14:10.514
You don't get to where I am
without developing a thick skin.

804
01:14:10.598 --> 01:14:12.767
But what I won't stand for,

805
01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:16.437
what I will lose sleep over,
and I love my sleep,

806
01:14:16.687 --> 01:14:20.441
is the idea of an irresponsible
rogue agent working in my office.

807
01:14:20.524 --> 01:14:24.320
So I'm going to
slow things way down here.

808
01:14:27.948 --> 01:14:29.408
You can look at me

809
01:14:29.492 --> 01:14:32.703
with those judgmental,
incriminating eyes all you want,

810
01:14:32.787 --> 01:14:34.497
but I bullshit you not.

811
01:14:34.622 --> 01:14:38.459
I will bleed on the flag
to make sure the stripes stay red.

812
01:14:57.478 --> 01:14:59.814
I don't know what to say to you.

813
01:15:00.981 --> 01:15:03.734
Brassel's right. You're out of control.

814
01:15:05.027 --> 01:15:06.487
Look at me.

815
01:15:08.239 --> 01:15:12.576
Ethan, at least show me the courtesy
of looking at me when I'm talking to you.

816
01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:25.422
I intercepted Davian's call. I know he
wants the rabbit's foot for Julia's life.

817
01:15:25.506 --> 01:15:27.007
It's just...

818
01:15:29.385 --> 01:15:30.678
This is

819
01:15:31.428 --> 01:15:33.180
<i>so disappointing.</i>

820
01:15:33.597 --> 01:15:37.643
Go to Shanghai.
Feng shan apartments --1406.

821
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:45.901
I wish there was something I could do
to help you, but...

822
01:15:51.323 --> 01:15:53.200
Take him to the holding cell.

823
01:17:06.982 --> 01:17:08.442
No, I'm on it.

824
01:17:08.567 --> 01:17:10.694
Yes, sir. There's no need to panic.
I'll get him back.

825
01:17:10.778 --> 01:17:11.862
Sir? Ethan hunt...

826
01:17:11.946 --> 01:17:13.322
I know what happened.
Give me the radio.

827
01:17:13.405 --> 01:17:16.200
This is director brassel. Ethan hunt
is attempting to escape the building.

828
01:17:16.283 --> 01:17:18.327
He's in the west cargo elevator.
He must be stopped.

829
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:21.205
I want mendoza and Graham
in the situation room right away.

830
01:17:21.288 --> 01:17:23.040
I'm having the building surrounded, sir.

831
01:17:23.123 --> 01:17:24.833
I've got units posted
at all the entrances.

832
01:17:24.917 --> 01:17:28.212
<i>This is brassel again. I 'm ordering</i>
a <i>code-six lockdown. I repeat.</i>

-Lt's hunt.
- I know it's hunt.

834
01:17:32.341 --> 01:17:35.094
Hunt was flagged
on sub-basement nine.

835
01:17:35.177 --> 01:17:38.514
I want all security personnel
down there now.

836
01:17:39.014 --> 01:17:40.724
Security channel's jammed.

837
01:17:40.808 --> 01:17:43.936
Hunt must be holding down
the transmit button.

838
01:18:07.459 --> 01:18:09.295
You've got to be kidding me.

839
01:18:19.972 --> 01:18:24.351
<i>Last call for flight 1162 for Helsinki,

844

01:18:45.914 --> 01:18:47.124

01:20:30.477 --> 01:20:31.854
I'm sorry.

849
01:20:33.188 --> 01:20:34.606
I'm sorry.

850
01:20:36.316 --> 01:20:39.862
Musgrave told us about Julia.
We're here to help.

851
01:20:39.987 --> 01:20:42.072
<i>To get your wife,
you'll need the rabbit's foot.</i>

852
01:20:42.156 --> 01:20:44.241
<i>According to the plans
from Davian's briefcase,</i>

853
01:20:44.324 --> 01:20:47.786
it's in a laboratory on the 56th floor
of the hengshan lu building.

854
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:49.746
Which is a nightmare
forjust about every reason.

855
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:53.500
They're a Chinese military contractor.
We have no pull, no details.

856
01:20:53.625 --> 01:20:55.419
The good news is, whatever it is,

857
01:20:55.502 --> 01:20:57.796
the rabbit foot's small,
so we can steal it.

858
01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.632
The bad news, we got to steal it.

859
01:21:01.467 --> 01:21:04.136
From a thief's point of view,
this is worst-case scenario.

860
01:21:04.219 --> 01:21:06.430
The security guards
are all privately-contracted

861
01:21:06.513 --> 01:21:07.931
former people's liberation army.

862
01:21:08.015 --> 01:21:10.267
The only access to the lab
is by private elevator.

863
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:13.061
And that can only be activated
by persons inside the lab.

864
01:21:13.145 --> 01:21:15.981
All of it surveilled by
security cameras within the building.

865
01:21:16.064 --> 01:21:17.983
What about the roof?

866
01:21:18.859 --> 01:21:21.653
Four guards full time.
Two on each rooftop.

867
01:21:21.737 --> 01:21:23.572
Langley was a cakewalk
compared to this.

868
01:21:23.655 --> 01:21:25.199
That's the one.

869
01:21:26.074 --> 01:21:28.076
- How tall is that building?
- Why?

870
01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.454
It's 162 meters at the highest point.

871
01:21:30.537 --> 01:21:32.998
What about that, the building
on the left? How tall is that one?

872
01:21:33.081 --> 01:21:34.583
Says 226 meters.

873
01:21:34.708 --> 01:21:37.336
226. Distance between the buildings?

874
01:21:37.419 --> 01:21:39.254
47.55 meters across.

875
01:21:55.896 --> 01:21:57.064
Ethan?

876
01:21:57.773 --> 01:22:00.567
That's good. I think it's tall enough.

877
01:22:01.735 --> 01:22:04.238
- For what?
- A fulcrum.

878
01:22:06.281 --> 01:22:08.992
Oh, you're gonna swing...
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

879
01:22:09.076 --> 01:22:11.495
- You could bounce right off the roof.
- Yes, I could.

880
01:22:11.578 --> 01:22:13.747
Even if you made it to the rooftop,
took out the guards,

881
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:17.501
and got the rabbit's foot, you can't just
walk out of the lobby. What's your exit?

882
01:22:17.584 --> 01:22:19.211
Base-jump off the top. I need a chute.

883
01:22:19.294 --> 01:22:21.505
Even at 162, you're pushing
minimum height for a jump.

884
01:22:21.588 --> 01:22:23.173
Chute opens any lower than that
and you're dead.

885
01:22:23.257 --> 01:22:24.341
What are you going to do?

886
01:22:24.424 --> 01:22:26.552
Land in the middle of Shanghai
and hope no one notices?

887
01:22:26.635 --> 01:22:27.928
Central park's two blocks away.

888
01:22:28.011 --> 01:22:29.930
Wait, wait, Ethan, I'm not saying
i have a better idea,

889
01:22:30.013 --> 01:22:32.516
but there's a point
where bold becomes stupid.

890
01:22:32.599 --> 01:22:35.060
Now, we don't even know
what this thing is, and you're talking

891
01:22:35.143 --> 01:22:38.021
about handing it over to a guy
who provides terrorists with information.

892
01:22:38.105 --> 01:22:40.232
Luther, of course I'm not
suggesting that we just hand it over.

893
01:22:40.315 --> 01:22:43.193
We're going to tag the rabbit's foot
so we can trace it and know where it is.

894
01:22:43.277 --> 01:22:46.196
Now, you know we can get
that gear here. I just deliver it myself.

895
01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.199
We contact musgrave,
have the imf trace a tag, order a raid,

896
01:22:49.283 --> 01:22:51.034
get the rabbit's foot back, grab Davian.

897
01:22:51.118 --> 01:22:53.870
Now, if I get outwith Julia, we win.

898
01:22:54.955 --> 01:22:56.790
If I don't, then...

899
01:23:03.130 --> 01:23:06.049
Look, then she's dead anyway.
And so am l.

900
01:23:07.217 --> 01:23:08.552
You know?

901
01:23:08.635 --> 01:23:13.015
Goddamn it, it's 8:11, it's 8:12.

902
01:23:15.475 --> 01:23:18.645
And we have two hours
before they kill my wife.

903
01:23:19.521 --> 01:23:21.315
Are you in or not?

904
01:23:28.822 --> 01:23:30.574
Of course we're in.

905
01:24:02.856 --> 01:24:04.691
You got 18 minutes.

906
01:24:07.027 --> 01:24:08.945
You're going to make it over there.

907
01:24:09.029 --> 01:24:12.407
You're going to find the rabbit's foot,
get back to the roof,

908
01:24:12.532 --> 01:24:14.326
radio me when you're ready to make
the jump,

909
01:24:14.409 --> 01:24:16.870
and we're going to come get you.

910
01:24:17.871 --> 01:24:19.623
Thank you for coming.

911
01:24:20.374 --> 01:24:21.875
That's my job.

912
01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.496
Batter up.

913
01:25:27.274 --> 01:25:30.318
Oh, yeah. They're freaking out.
Hit them again.

914
01:27:05.205 --> 01:27:06.373
Okay.

915
01:27:07.874 --> 01:27:08.875
<i>He made it.</i>

916
01:27:09.042 --> 01:27:10.460
He made it.

917
01:27:13.547 --> 01:27:15.382
I knew he'd make it.

918
01:27:29.896 --> 01:27:32.816
<i>I'm going in. I'll be out in five minutes.</i>

919
01:27:40.949 --> 01:27:43.368
-Lt's been 12 minutes.
- He's got five minutes left.

920
01:27:43.451 --> 01:27:46.913
If he doesn't call Davian in five minutes,
Julia's dead.

921
01:27:46.997 --> 01:27:48.415
<i>Anything?</i>

922
01:27:49.916 --> 01:27:50.959
Negative.

923
01:27:51.084 --> 01:27:53.211
<i>How about you? Any good news?</i>

924
01:27:53.295 --> 01:27:54.754
No, nothing.

925
01:27:54.921 --> 01:27:56.423
Come on, Ethan.

926
01:28:05.682 --> 01:28:07.183
What is that?

927
01:28:12.314 --> 01:28:16.651
When I was little I had a cat,
and he used to run away all the time.

928
01:28:18.111 --> 01:28:21.281
And it's just a prayer I'd say
to bring him home.

929
01:28:23.199 --> 01:28:24.784
Teach it to me.

930
01:28:26.494 --> 01:28:28.705
<i>I've got the rabbit's foot,
but I can't make it to the roof.</i>

931
01:28:28.788 --> 01:28:31.625
What the hell do you mean you can't
make it to the roof? Where are you?

932
01:28:31.708 --> 01:28:33.793
<i>Look up! Look up, look up!</i>

933
01:28:36.630 --> 01:28:38.840
- Oh, shit.
- He's way too low.

934
01:30:29.576 --> 01:30:32.620
- Ethan! Get in! They're coming!
- Who?

935
01:30:32.746 --> 01:30:35.415
Building security, and they're pissed.

936
01:30:37.959 --> 01:30:39.836
Okay. Go, go, 90, 90-

937
01:30:46.676 --> 01:30:48.803
how much time you got left?

938
01:30:49.095 --> 01:30:50.930
Less than two minutes.

939
01:30:57.187 --> 01:31:00.356
You gotta get us out of here.
I lost the signal.

940
01:31:03.026 --> 01:31:04.819
- You okay?
- Not yet.

941
01:31:13.161 --> 01:31:14.329
Come on. Come on.

942
01:31:21.711 --> 01:31:23.379
I don't have a signal.
I don't have a signal.

943
01:31:23.463 --> 01:31:24.672
I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it!

944
01:31:33.139 --> 01:31:34.224
Zhen!

945
01:31:36.309 --> 01:31:37.977
Damn it. I'm sorry.

946
01:31:46.194 --> 01:31:47.904
Put pressure on it.

947
01:31:48.363 --> 01:31:51.533
- Tell me when you get a signal.
- What are you doing?

948
01:32:10.593 --> 01:32:12.178
I got a signal!

949
01:32:16.516 --> 01:32:17.851
Hit redial.

950
01:32:19.936 --> 01:32:22.647
<i>You only had five seconds left.
Do you realize that?</i>

951
01:32:22.730 --> 01:32:25.066
The rabbit's foot. I have it.

952
01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:29.445
<i>The train yard at dunan zhong lu.
Wait for me there. Alone.</i>

953
01:32:32.699 --> 01:32:34.200
<i>- Yeah?
- Go secure.</i>

954
01:32:34.284 --> 01:32:35.535
We are.

955
01:32:36.619 --> 01:32:38.663
<i>I have the rabbit's foot.</i>

956
01:32:38.746 --> 01:32:41.040
- You okay?
-L'm tagging it now.

957
01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.337
You need to run a trace.
Make sure we have eyes on this thing.

958
01:32:46.421 --> 01:32:49.424
- What's the tag?
-6-3-9-6-4-1.

959
01:32:50.383 --> 01:32:51.551
Got it.

960
01:32:54.262 --> 01:32:55.638
I see you on luang tao lu road.

961
01:32:55.722 --> 01:32:59.225
If you don't hear from me in eight hours,
you send an army after this thing.

962
01:32:59.309 --> 01:33:01.227
- Good luck.
- You, too.

963
01:33:08.568 --> 01:33:10.403
<i>- Mr. musgrave.
- Yeah.</i>

964
01:33:10.612 --> 01:33:12.697
<i>It's come to my attention
that yesterday afternoon</i>

965
01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:14.282
<i>you sent a team to the far east.</i>

966
01:33:14.949 --> 01:33:16.993
We received intel that
hadaam saleen bahar

967
01:33:17.076 --> 01:33:18.369
was en route to Shanghai.

968
01:33:18.453 --> 01:33:20.788
- Hadaam saleen bahar.
- That's right.

969
01:33:20.914 --> 01:33:22.832
You know what I'd love?
I'd love to see that intel.

970
01:33:22.916 --> 01:33:25.418
<i>-L'll</i> be in my office.
- Yes, sir.

971
01:33:37.931 --> 01:33:39.432
Thanks again.

972
01:33:39.807 --> 01:33:41.809
I'll see you back home.

973
01:33:42.685 --> 01:33:43.937
Ethan.

974
01:33:45.104 --> 01:33:48.107
You know they probably plan
to kill you both.

975
01:33:49.776 --> 01:33:52.111
Then I won't see you back home.

976
01:33:53.655 --> 01:33:55.281
Better get back.

977
01:34:42.203 --> 01:34:44.664
Drink it. No questions.

978
01:35:48.227 --> 01:35:49.604
Good morning.

979
01:36:05.495 --> 01:36:06.662
Jules.

980
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:10.708
We've put an explosive charge
in your head.

981
01:36:10.792 --> 01:36:12.919
Does that sound familiar?

982
01:36:13.586 --> 01:36:15.922
The rabbit's foot. Where is it?

983
01:36:16.631 --> 01:36:18.341
I gave it to you.

984
01:36:18.925 --> 01:36:21.135
Now, I'm going to count to 10

985
01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:24.931
and you're going to tell me
where the rabbit's foot is

986
01:36:26.265 --> 01:36:27.683
or she dies.

987
01:36:52.834 --> 01:36:56.212
Seems we have a lot to talk about.
Don't we?

988
01:36:59.048 --> 01:37:01.008
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

989
01:37:01.092 --> 01:37:03.845
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

990
01:37:03.928 --> 01:37:05.012
Where is it?

991
01:37:05.096 --> 01:37:06.472
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

992
01:37:06.556 --> 01:37:07.849
- Look at me. Stay with me.
- Seven!

993
01:37:07.932 --> 01:37:10.184
Lam going to kill you.
I swear to god I'm going to...

994
01:37:10.268 --> 01:37:12.145
- Eight!
- No, please.

995
01:37:13.938 --> 01:37:17.483
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

996
01:37:18.067 --> 01:37:21.112
I promise you. I promise you.

997
01:37:21.446 --> 01:37:24.157
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

998
01:37:25.158 --> 01:37:28.119
Listen to me. I want to help you get
whatever you want.

999
01:37:28.202 --> 01:37:31.789
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

1000
01:37:32.665 --> 01:37:34.167
No, please...

1001
01:37:36.794 --> 01:37:37.879
No.

1002
01:37:40.089 --> 01:37:41.132
No.

1003
01:37:41.466 --> 01:37:43.217
- Ten.
- Don't!

1004
01:38:00.026 --> 01:38:03.696
I pushed him as far as he can go.
I know he's not lying.

1005
01:38:03.988 --> 01:38:05.531
I understand.

1006
01:38:06.115 --> 01:38:09.327
I've got some questions
i want to ask him first.

1007
01:38:31.724 --> 01:38:33.392
It's complicated.

1008
01:38:40.274 --> 01:38:42.527
You can't just open the canister.

1009
01:38:42.610 --> 01:38:45.488
We had to make sure
you brought the real thing.

1010
01:38:45.571 --> 01:38:48.908
The rabbit's foot. Now we know.

1011
01:38:57.667 --> 01:39:00.920
Don't you touch her!
Don't you touch her!

1012
01:39:10.137 --> 01:39:13.599
Davian's translator,
his head of security.

1013
01:39:14.892 --> 01:39:18.062
Remember?
At the Vatican she failed him.

1014
01:39:20.398 --> 01:39:24.610
Ethan, Julia is still alive.

1015
01:39:25.403 --> 01:39:29.282
Davian wanted to kill you both,
but I convinced him otherwise.

1016
01:39:29.365 --> 01:39:33.244
Julia hasn't seen me.
She doesn't know anything. She's clean.

1017
01:39:33.369 --> 01:39:35.705
She can go on to have a life.

1018
01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:40.668
As long as you tell me,
what was in Lindsey's message?

1019
01:39:41.627 --> 01:39:44.505
I know she sent you a microdot
from Berlin.

1020
01:39:45.881 --> 01:39:48.384
Did Lindsey know
about me and Davian?

1021
01:39:48.467 --> 01:39:51.429
Is that why she sent the message
to you? Did you read it?

1022
01:39:51.512 --> 01:39:53.180
Did anyone else see it?

1023
01:39:53.264 --> 01:39:55.558
Did she know about the work
i was doing?

1024
01:39:55.641 --> 01:39:57.643
Could I be compromised at imf?

1025
01:39:57.727 --> 01:39:59.395
Ethan. Ethan.

1026
01:40:00.813 --> 01:40:03.190
Did she buy that brassel set her up?

1027
01:40:03.274 --> 01:40:05.026
Did she buy that?

1028
01:40:06.277 --> 01:40:07.737
You told him.

1029
01:40:09.071 --> 01:40:11.574
That's how Davian knew
Lindsey was coming.

1030
01:40:11.657 --> 01:40:13.284
You told him.

1031
01:40:15.202 --> 01:40:17.496
I thought you could get her back.

1032
01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:21.208
But I wasn't gonna let brassel,
of all people, undo the work I'd done.

1033
01:40:21.292 --> 01:40:25.755
I took action, Ethan, on behalf
of the working families of our country.

1034
01:40:25.838 --> 01:40:27.256
The armed forces, the white house.

1035
01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:29.300
I'd had enough
of brassel and his sanctimony.

1036
01:40:29.383 --> 01:40:32.720
Imf executive director.
He's an affirmative action poster boy.

1037
01:40:32.803 --> 01:40:36.307
You grab Davian like he wanted,
then what?

1038
01:40:36.849 --> 01:40:38.517
Davian's a weed.

1039
01:40:40.186 --> 01:40:44.273
You cut him out, two more spring up
just like him the next day.

1040
01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.359
Arrest him? Then what?

1041
01:40:47.777 --> 01:40:49.195
You use him.

1042
01:40:50.655 --> 01:40:53.324
Collaborate with him.

1043
01:40:54.784 --> 01:40:56.827
And it's Christmas.

1044
01:40:58.621 --> 01:41:01.582
In 18 hours,
the rabbit's foot will be delivered

1045
01:41:01.666 --> 01:41:04.960
to its middle eastern buyer,
and we'll have credible intel to prove it.

1046
01:41:05.044 --> 01:41:07.922
Us security council will get a report
by this time tomorrow.

1047
01:41:08.005 --> 01:41:11.092
We're talking a military strike
within a week.

1048
01:41:11.467 --> 01:41:13.552
And when the sand settles,

1049
01:41:14.011 --> 01:41:16.514
our country will do what it does best.

1050
01:41:16.597 --> 01:41:19.308
Clean up. Infrastructure.

1051
01:41:21.018 --> 01:41:22.645
Democracy wins.

1052
01:41:26.982 --> 01:41:29.860
What was Lindsey's message?

1053
01:41:30.861 --> 01:41:34.198
You tell me, and Julia walks.

1054
01:41:36.742 --> 01:41:39.245
It's the only play you have left.

1055
01:41:40.579 --> 01:41:43.999
Not till I hear her voice,
know she's alive.

1056
01:41:46.127 --> 01:41:47.461
Of course.

1057
01:42:00.558 --> 01:42:01.934
Put her on.

1058
01:42:09.525 --> 01:42:11.694
- Jules?
- Ethan?

1059
01:42:11.944 --> 01:42:15.239
When we met,
there was a lake near the mountain.

1060
01:42:17.408 --> 01:42:19.410
What was the lake called?

1061
01:42:20.703 --> 01:42:21.954
<i>Vvanaka.</i>

1062
01:42:22.538 --> 01:42:24.123
<i>Please, Ethan.</i>

1063
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:26.876
<i>- Jules.
- Ethan, I don't understand...</i>

1064
01:42:46.228 --> 01:42:47.772
Benjamin dunne.

1065
01:42:48.481 --> 01:42:49.565
Benji, it's me.

1066
01:42:49.648 --> 01:42:52.735
- Ethan.
- What? No. Really?

1067
01:42:52.818 --> 01:42:54.528
<i>Listen to me very carefully.
I need your help.</i>

1068
01:42:56.197 --> 01:42:59.450
I need to trace the location
of the last call made from this phone.

1069
01:42:59.533 --> 01:43:01.202
Look, no. Ethan. Shush.

1070
01:43:01.285 --> 01:43:03.037
<i>They're looking...
Everyone's looking for you.</i>

1071
01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.207
<i>Everyone I know. They're looking...
I just looked it up.</i>

1072
01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:08.125
<i>Okay, you're on
lnterpol's most wanted list.</i>

1073
01:43:08.209 --> 01:43:10.711
And that, by the way,
is a spectacular list to be on.

1074
01:43:10.795 --> 01:43:13.255
<i>Whatever happened, I'm sorry,
but I'm hanging up now right now.</i>

1075
01:43:13.339 --> 01:43:14.590
Benji, I don't have time for this.

1076
01:43:14.673 --> 01:43:16.342
What do you think happened?
I've been set up.

1077
01:43:16.425 --> 01:43:19.512
I think I like myjob. Okay? A lot.

1078
01:43:19.595 --> 01:43:21.472
All right? And you know
they're gonna be taping this call.

1079
01:43:21.764 --> 01:43:24.517
And you know you can erase it.
I'm giving you the number right now.

1080
01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.727
- Are you ready?
- All right. Just hang on.

1081
01:43:26.811 --> 01:43:29.188
I'm gonna lose my citizenship
because of this, you know.

1082
01:43:29.271 --> 01:43:32.149
7-3-4-4-2-5-6-4-3-6-7.

1083
01:43:32.233 --> 01:43:35.027
Okay. Wait. Okay. Hold the line, please.

1084
01:43:49.333 --> 01:43:50.960
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

1085
01:43:51.043 --> 01:43:52.294
<i>Okay-</i>

1086
01:43:52.962 --> 01:43:56.131
<i>maybe we can share a jail cell together,
you know?</i>

1087
01:43:56.215 --> 01:43:58.801
If this all goes tits up, which it will.

1088
01:43:58.884 --> 01:44:00.719
The location of that number
is Shanghai.

1089
01:44:00.803 --> 01:44:02.096
There, I just told you. Shanghai.

1090
01:44:02.179 --> 01:44:04.807
I've just aided and abetted an enemy
of the state. Fantastic. Thank you.

1091
01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:07.226
Am I close?
Use this phone to track my location.

1092
01:44:07.309 --> 01:44:09.728
Oh, you're there. Well, you're close.

1093
01:44:09.812 --> 01:44:11.605
How close?
Ls the signal in the building?

1094
01:44:11.689 --> 01:44:13.148
No, no, no. It isn't coming from there.

1095
01:44:13.232 --> 01:44:15.067
It's in a building
one mile to the northeast.

1096
01:44:15.150 --> 01:44:16.777
<i>Benji, lead me to the signal.</i>

1097
01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:32.835
<i>There is one thing. What the hell
are you doing in Shanghai?</i>

1098
01:44:32.918 --> 01:44:35.129
I'll tell you when I see you.

1099
01:44:43.637 --> 01:44:45.931
What you...
You need to go north.

1100
01:44:46.015 --> 01:44:48.392
Okay, there's a bridge.
Get to it, cross it.

1101
01:44:48.475 --> 01:44:51.854
<i>Make a left. Go three-quarters of a mile
along the river.</i>

1102
01:44:51.937 --> 01:44:53.772
I got it. I got it.

1103
01:45:29.141 --> 01:45:31.101
Good, good. That's right.
Keep going. Keep going.

1104
01:45:31.185 --> 01:45:32.603
Make your next left
and then the next one.

1105
01:45:32.686 --> 01:45:34.313
And then follow that down 1,000 yards.

1106
01:45:34.396 --> 01:45:36.106
A thousand yards.

1107
01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.360
<i>- Okay. Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay. Left. Left.</i>

1108
01:45:39.902 --> 01:45:42.029
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
Keep going. Keep going.

1109
01:45:42.112 --> 01:45:44.281
Okay, now look... hiya. Hi.

1110
01:45:44.365 --> 01:45:45.866
<i>Benji, where?</i>

1111
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:48.243
<i>- Benji? Which way do I go?
- Now take a fight.</i>

1112
01:45:54.959 --> 01:45:56.460
Okay. Go down, left.

1113
01:45:56.835 --> 01:45:58.712
Left? I'm going left.

1114
01:46:00.589 --> 01:46:01.715
<i>Good, good.</i>

1115
01:46:01.799 --> 01:46:03.550
It's in the second building on your left.

1116
01:46:03.634 --> 01:46:06.011
The signal bearing's
plus or minus three meters

1117
01:46:06.095 --> 01:46:07.262
from the northeast corner.

1118
01:46:07.763 --> 01:46:09.056
I owe you.

1119
01:48:06.298 --> 01:48:08.258
Jules. Jules.

1120
01:48:08.884 --> 01:48:10.552
You're gonna be okay.

1121
01:48:13.555 --> 01:48:14.848
Oh, god!

1122
01:48:15.349 --> 01:48:16.433
God!

1123
01:48:27.069 --> 01:48:29.530
I've activated the charge in your head.

1124
01:48:34.993 --> 01:48:37.496
You have maybe four minutes left.

1125
01:48:46.964 --> 01:48:49.675
Didn't I tell you
she'd call out your name?

1126
01:48:55.764 --> 01:48:58.767
Ethan. Ethan.

1127
01:49:02.855 --> 01:49:03.981
No.

1128
01:49:08.819 --> 01:49:10.154
Please.

1129
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:18.328
And I told you I was going to kill you
in front of her?

1130
01:49:18.412 --> 01:49:20.998
Well, I'm going to kill her
in front of you.

1131
01:51:13.485 --> 01:51:14.653
Ethan?

1132
01:51:17.948 --> 01:51:19.449
Are you okay?

1133
01:51:20.492 --> 01:51:22.244
I don't understand
what's going on, Ethan.

1134
01:51:22.327 --> 01:51:25.289
- I know. I know. Just wait.
- What do those men want from you?

1135
01:51:25.372 --> 01:51:28.041
Why are we here?
How did you find me?

1136
01:51:29.126 --> 01:51:31.962
Please, Ethan.
What the hell is going on?

1137
01:51:32.087 --> 01:51:33.422
Are you okay?

1138
01:51:33.505 --> 01:51:37.259
Ethan, what's wrong? Okay. Oh, god.

1139
01:51:40.345 --> 01:51:44.266
I'm going to tell you everything.
You just stay with me.

1140
01:51:50.856 --> 01:51:53.817
Ethan. What's happening?
What are you looking for?

1141
01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:56.653
- We've got to get out of here.
- Not yet.

1142
01:51:58.405 --> 01:52:00.115
- They don't have one!
- What?

1143
01:52:00.198 --> 01:52:02.659
- A defibrillator.
- A defibrillator?

1144
01:52:02.743 --> 01:52:03.869
Ethan?

1145
01:52:04.619 --> 01:52:08.582
Ethan? Who are these people?
What the hell are we doing here?

1146
01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:12.711
Good!

1147
01:52:14.129 --> 01:52:16.256
This is a beretta 92f.

1148
01:52:17.049 --> 01:52:18.884
It's a very accurate,
close-range weapon.

1149
01:52:18.967 --> 01:52:21.219
- Don't point it at me.
- Sorry.

1150
01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:24.598
It holds 15 rounds.

1151
01:52:24.681 --> 01:52:28.060
When the mag is empty,
the slide will lock back like this.

1152
01:52:28.143 --> 01:52:30.395
How do you know so much about this?

1153
01:52:30.479 --> 01:52:33.106
To reload, push this button.

1154
01:52:33.523 --> 01:52:35.108
The empty mag falls out

1155
01:52:35.192 --> 01:52:37.152
and you shove the other one in,

1156
01:52:37.235 --> 01:52:39.738
like the batteries in the flashlight
in the kitchen,

1157
01:52:39.821 --> 01:52:41.782
then release the slide.

1158
01:52:44.951 --> 01:52:46.995
- Why are you giving me a gun?
- There could be others.

1159
01:52:47.079 --> 01:52:48.872
If you have to use it, you stay low.

1160
01:52:48.955 --> 01:52:51.708
You identify your enemy.
Point and shoot.

1161
01:52:51.792 --> 01:52:53.377
It's very simple. Point and shoot.

1162
01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:54.878
Stand back.

1163
01:52:56.588 --> 01:52:57.714
Good.

1164
01:52:59.007 --> 01:53:01.760
I have a charge in my head.
I'm going to die unless you kill me.

1165
01:53:01.843 --> 01:53:03.845
- What?
- Throw the switch on and off.

1166
01:53:03.929 --> 01:53:05.389
- Don't forget the off.
- I can't do that.

1167
01:53:05.472 --> 01:53:07.724
You can bring me back.
I'll come back.

1168
01:53:07.808 --> 01:53:10.060
- I can't.
- You have to! There's no time!

1169
01:53:10.143 --> 01:53:11.645
Now! Please!

1170
01:53:18.485 --> 01:53:21.071
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait. I love you.

1171
01:53:21.321 --> 01:53:22.697
I love you.

1172
01:54:37.856 --> 01:54:39.107
Oh, god.

1173
01:54:45.238 --> 01:54:46.740
Come on, baby.

1174
01:54:51.077 --> 01:54:54.539
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight,

1175
01:54:54.623 --> 01:54:58.251
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen.

1176
01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:07.886
Come on, baby.
I need you to come back.

1177
01:55:09.262 --> 01:55:10.889
I need you back.

1178
01:55:57.102 --> 01:55:58.436
Oh, god.

1179
01:56:07.654 --> 01:56:09.114
You did that?

1180
01:56:12.951 --> 01:56:14.077
Wow.

1181
01:56:40.937 --> 01:56:43.064
So, I was just thinking...

1182
01:56:45.483 --> 01:56:49.446
I was thinking you might want to tell me
why we're in China.

1183
01:56:50.947 --> 01:56:52.198
I know.

1184
01:56:56.286 --> 01:56:57.370
L.-

1185
01:56:59.164 --> 01:57:01.041
I work for an agency.

1186
01:57:02.083 --> 01:57:03.710
It's called imf.

1187
01:57:06.421 --> 01:57:08.423
What does that stand for?

1188
01:57:09.633 --> 01:57:11.718
Impossible mission force.

1189
01:57:12.677 --> 01:57:13.887
Shut up.

1190
01:57:14.763 --> 01:57:16.139
No, I'm not kidding.

1191
01:57:16.222 --> 01:57:20.143
You don't understand.
Everything I'm telling you is top-secret.

1192
01:57:20.226 --> 01:57:21.978
You can trust me.

1193
01:57:22.437 --> 01:57:23.730
Yeah, I know.

1194
01:57:25.148 --> 01:57:27.651
<i>Just wanna show my appreciation
for your work.</i>

1195
01:57:35.158 --> 01:57:39.079
Call it reparations for anything
i might have put you through.

1196
01:57:39.454 --> 01:57:41.581
You should know
the white house has contacted me.

1197
01:57:41.665 --> 01:57:44.042
Now, there's a job that they are

1198
01:57:44.668 --> 01:57:47.295
very interested
in speaking with you about.

1199
01:57:50.715 --> 01:57:53.176
Thank you,

1200
01:57:54.219 --> 01:57:55.387
but I have a lot to think about.

1201
01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:58.556
You aren't considering quitting,
are you, Ethan?

1202
01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:01.267
I'm considering
going on my honeymoon.

1203
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:05.397
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

1204
01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:06.606
Yeah.

1205
01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:09.984
Hey, one thing.

1206
01:58:11.528 --> 01:58:13.822
The rabbit's foot. What is it?

1207
01:58:17.242 --> 01:58:20.078
Promise me you'll stay, I'll tell you.

1208
01:58:22.664 --> 01:58:25.500
- I'll send you a postcard.
- Fair enough.
