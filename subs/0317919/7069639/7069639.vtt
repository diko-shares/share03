00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.699
<i>We've put an explosive charge
in your head.</i>

2
00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.624
Does that sound familiar?

3
00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:46.046
The rabbit's foot. Where is it?

4
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.799
I gave it to you.

5
00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.927
Ethan, where's the rabbit's foot?

6
00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:55.806
Wait... what are you saying?
That wasn't it?

7
00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.560
- What I gave you, was that...
-L'm going to count to 10.

8
00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:03.730
You're going to tell me
where the rabbit's foot is or she dies.

9
00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.157
Jules, it's going to be okay.

10
00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:17.911
It's going to be okay.
Do you understand?

11
00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:20.163
One.

12
00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:23.584
You listen to me.
I got exactly what you asked for.

13
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.961
Did you want something else?

14
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.213
If there was a misunderstanding,
i will fix it.

15
00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:30.215
I can get it, whatever you want.

16
00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.508
Two.

17
00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:35.012
Listen. Talk to me. We can talk,

18
00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:36.930
like gentlemen.

19
00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.851
- Three.
- God!

20
00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:52.696
All right. All right, all right.

21
00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.700
I know where the rabbit's foot is.

22
00:01:57.868 --> 00:01:59.036
I can help you.

23
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.830
The way you helped me
on the airplane?

24
00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.582
That way?

25
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.627
You put the gun down.
I'm not talking to you like this.

26
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.171
That's your choice. Four.

27
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.132
The rabbit's foot's in Paris.

28
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.968
You want to know where in Paris?
Then let her go.

29
00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:18.180
-'Cause you will not...
-Lt's not in Paris. Five.

30
00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:21.683
I can get it for you.

31
00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:23.685
But you kill her, you do this,
you get nothing.

32
00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.021
- Six.
- Are you listening to me?

33
00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:29.316
The only way you're going
to get what you want is for you to...

34
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.485
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

35
00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.945
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

36
00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.864
Where is it? Where the hell is it?

37
00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.449
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

38
00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.951
- Stay with me.
- Seven! Seven!

39
00:02:40.077 --> 00:02:44.581
Lam going to kill you.
I swear to god I'm going to kill you!

40
00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.750
- Eight!
- No, please.

41
00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:55.592
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

42
00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:00.514
I promise you. I promise you.

43
00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.266
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

44
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.603
Listen to me. Listen to me.

45
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.065
I want to help you.

46
00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.859
I want to help you get
whatever you want.

47
00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:16.697
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

48
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.580
No. No.

49
00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:30.377
No.

50
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.920
- Ten.
- Don't!

51
00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.085
- What are you doing?
- Your brother wants another one.

52
00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.879
Oh, god, no.
Ethan, that's what we talked about...

53
00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.922
-I'm watching him. He's fine.
- That's how it is with Rick.

54
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.592
He's fine and then suddenly he's naked
and he's hugging everybody.

55
00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.595
<i>-L'll</i> take full responsibility for Rick.
- You will? Full?

56
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.181
- Well, mostly full.
-Lt's a huge responsibility.

57
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.849
It's going well, right?

58
00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.268
- It's going really well.
- Yeah.

59
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.104
Julia, your sister's here.

60
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.024
- Give me a hug.
- You look so beautiful.

61
00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.193
I don't know about that. So, is this him?

62
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.945
- I hope so.
- Oh, come here. Oh, gosh.

63
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.615
All right. Mom's dying to see you.

64
00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.742
I can't believe
you guys came all the way to Virginia.

65
00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.076
Like we'd miss your engagement...

66
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.039
When Julia called and told me
that she was getting married,

67
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.125
I had one thought,
that it was just too bad

68
00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:56.505
that daddy wasn't here
to walk her down the aisle.

69
00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.800
And then when Julia told me...
Thanks, mom.

70
00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.385
That Ethan doesn't have
his parents anymore, either,

71
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.304
I got really sad.

72
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:08.558
But it occurred to me
that this is about starting a new family

73
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.644
and how beautiful that is.

74
00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:13.897
And I just want to say
i am making Julia an aunt,

75
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.817
so I expect the same treatment
very, very soon.

76
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.193
Cheers!

77
00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.158
Department of transportation?

78
00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:27.494
I've been there over 10 years now.
Wow.

79
00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.162
What do you do at the dot?

80
00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:30.789
I study traffic patterns.

81
00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.166
You hit the brakes for a second,
just tap them on the freeway,

82
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.168
you can literally track
the ripple effect of that action

83
00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:36.795
across a 200-mile stretch of road,

84
00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.171
because traffic has a memory.

85
00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:40.298
It's amazing. It's like a living organism.

86
00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.092
Freshen that up for you?
What is it, vodka Martini?

87
00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.301
Yeah. Thanks.

88
00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.345
Ladies, do you need...

89
00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.350
-I'd marry him.
- I would, too.

90
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.311
Okay, so, a three-week
heli-boarding honeymoon?

91
00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:56.356
- Okay, you actually get dropped...
- From a helicopter, yeah.

92
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.400
- It's how they met.
- Really?

93
00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.360
- Tell her the story.
- There's no story.

94
00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.070
It is a good story. Tell the story.

95
00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:05.240
First of all,
no one was ever good enough for Julia.

96
00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.575
Oh, here we go.

97
00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:10.620
Not spontaneous enough,
adventurous enough, funny enough...

98
00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:13.540
You know what? No, that's not true.
You make it sound like I've never dated.

99
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:14.666
No one we liked.

100
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.585
- That is true.
- That is true.

101
00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.935
Then she goes and gets in a chopper
that takes off from this lake...

102
00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.855
- What was the name of that lake?
- Lakeâ€œ.

103
00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:40.317
Lake wanaka. Wanaka.

104
00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.819
Wanaka. Thank you.

105
00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.697
- He heard that?
- How did he hear that?

106
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.741
And the hospital's cool
with you taking three weeks?

107
00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.869
Yeah, I'm not the only nurse
employed there, you know.

108
00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.772
I'm psyched that you're going
to be my brother, man.

109
00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:19.940
So am I, Rick.

110
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.900
No, it's awesome.
I think it's going to be sick.

111
00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.402
Me, too, man.
I just got to get the phone.

112
00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.363
- You rock hard.
- Okay.

113
00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.448
Hello?

114
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.700
<i>- Is this Mr. Ethan hunt?
Mes, 'Ms.</i>

115
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.286
<i>This is ready-travel resort services.</i>

116
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.041
<i>We'd like to offer you a chance to win
an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.</i>

117
00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.728
We ran out of ice.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

118
00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.106
- Oh, no. Can't somebody else go?
- No, I got it.

119
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.149
I'll be right back. Hi, Betsy.

120
00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.567
Thank you.

121
00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.712
$1.86.

122
00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:37.100
Thanks for coming.
Can't decide what size slurpee to get.

123
00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.186
I usually go for the 900-ouncer.

124
00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:44.524
How's that party? Sorry I had to call you.

125
00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.651
- Yeah, you should have come.
- You should have invited me.

126
00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:49.112
- You know I would have.
- Thanks.

127
00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.701
I know we joke about it, but I am always
this close to begging you

128
00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.203
to stop training our people
and get your ass back in the field.

129
00:08:57.287 --> 00:09:00.165
But that's not what you do anymore,
and so I respect that choice.

130
00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:04.419
You know I do. Family's everything.

131
00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.965
Come on, John. What's going on?

132
00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.637
It's agent farris.

133
00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.307
She was on an operation.

134
00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.436
She's disappeared.
Been off-grid 11 hours.

135
00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:27.067
I'm sending in search and rescue.
I was hoping you'd want in.

136
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.199
You've got good people for that.

137
00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:39.829
Yeah. Yep, that we do.

138
00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:43.833
Wheels up at sunrise
if you have a change of heart.

139
00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:47.170
Take some pictures of the party for me.

140
00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.608
<i>Ethan. Three days ago,</i>

141
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:12.237
<i>agent Lindsey farris was captured
while on a surveillance operation.</i>

142
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.073
<i>This is the man she was tracking.
His name is Owen Davian.</i>

143
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.449
<i>Details are eyes-only,</i>

144
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.327
<i>but I can tell you
that Davian's a black-market trafficker.</i>

145
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.330
<i>Extremely dangerous
and a priority for us.</i>

146
00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.415
<i>At 1400 hours today,</i>

147
00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.668
<i>a recon satellite ID 'd
a caravan of vehicles</i>

148
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:30.421
<i>with plates matching those known to
have been used by Davian's operatives.</i>

149
00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.091
<i>They stopped at a derelict factory
outside Berlin.</i>

150
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:36.427
<i>It appears they have a hostage.
We believe it's agent farris.</i>

151
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.638
<i>Normally we would disavow,</i>

152
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:40.807
<i>but Lindsey may be the key
to getting us closer to Davian,</i>

153
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.600
<i>and that's a risk we need to take.</i>

154
00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:45.436
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

155
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.148
<i>is to find Lindsey and bring her home.</i>

156
00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.984
<i>I've already assembled a team.</i>

157
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.486
<i>I have them standing by,
awaiting your word.</i>

158
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:58.950
<i>This message, let's call it
my excellent engagement gift to you,</i>

159
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.702
<i>will self-destruct in five seconds.</i>

160
00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:03.413
<i>Good luck, Ethan, and thanks again.</i>

161
00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.555
<i>Am I ready?</i>

162
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.403
- You okay?
- Yeah.

163
00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:38.531
Yeah.

164
00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:56.132
You know, I'm sorry. I realized
i didn't tell you that the office called

165
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.427
during the party.
I have to go to Houston for a night.

166
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:03.431
Metro's having
a public transpo conference.

167
00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:10.021
- It's so last-minute.
- I know.

168
00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:38.383
Well, well, well.

169
00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:42.136
Now, if it isn't
Mr. "those who can't do, teach"

170
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.763
back in the field.

171
00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:46.057
- What's up, baby?
- Hey, man.

172
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:50.478
Hey, Ethan, don't worry.
We're going to get the girl.

173
00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:54.732
Or have you been away so long
you've forgotten how good we are?

174
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.568
Welcome back, brother.

175
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.469
Is our truck in place?

176
00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:24.679
Weapons good to go?

177
00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:26.514
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

178
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.599
You know I got your six.

179
00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:31.144
Hey, man. That's your job.

180
00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:55.543
<i>Guns one, activated.
Guns two, activated.</i>

181
00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:58.671
<i>Guns three, activated.
Guns four, activated.</i>

182
00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.132
<i>Guns ready.</i>

183
00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:09.015
All four guns operational.

184
00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:12.810
They've got men on
the second, third, fourth floors.

185
00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.313
<i>I count 14 of them.</i>

186
00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:18.524
Observer, I'm in approach position.

187
00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.526
Roger that. Stand by.

188
00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:26.908
<i>Target match.</i>

189
00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:29.911
The prize is on the sixth floor.
Two tangos with her.

190
00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:31.621
Moving in.

191
00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.264
<i>So, raider one, at some point,</i>

192
00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:52.767
we got to go over
this whole "getting married" thing.

193
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.685
Negative, observer.

194
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.605
I don't respect you nearly enough
to have that conversation.

195
00:14:57.688 --> 00:14:58.856
<i>You may not respect me,</i>

196
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.109
<i>but for now you're stuck
with my voice in your head.</i>

197
00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:04.112
So, this girl,
what the hell do you see in her anyway?

198
00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:07.407
Who, Julia? You've never met her.

199
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.410
Yeah, and the way things are,
i probably never will.

200
00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:13.579
<i>Lucky for her, right?
That's what you're thinking.</i>

201
00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:15.498
They've got communications gear.

202
00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:18.584
Two tangos, second floor,
northwest corridor.

203
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.378
Groundhog, that's you.

204
00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:22.130
<i>You need to grab that gear
on the second floor</i>

205
00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:23.589
<i>as soon as we go hot.</i>

206
00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:26.217
Copy that. I'll need two minutes,

207
00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.052
which means
you'll need me in one, right?

208
00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:29.762
Yeah, just about.

209
00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:32.181
Raider one,
make a left at the top of the stairs.

210
00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:35.268
<i>The prize should be
at the end of the hall.</i>

211
00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:55.913
Phoenix, I have eye on the prize.

212
00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.957
Give her 1 o c:C:'S more.

213
00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:05.381
- Call me when she wakes.
- Okay.

214
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.092
We need touchdown in less than three.
Do you copy?

215
00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:09.635
<i>Roger that, I copy.</i>

216
00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.805
Please, when do I not copy?
All I do is copy.

217
00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:19.520
Stand by to go live. On my mark.

218
00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:21.731
<i>Three.</i>

219
00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:22.899
<i>Two.</i>

220
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.734
One. Execute.

221
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.661
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

222
00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:58.309
Raider one, you're clear. Move!

223
00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:08.152
Lindsey. Lindsey.

224
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.072
Ethan?

225
00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.742
I'm going to get you home.

226
00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:21.499
Observer, I've got the prize.
Evac in three.

227
00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.084
<i>Roger that.</i>

228
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.760
This is adrenaline.
Lindsey, you're going to feel this.

229
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:51.779
<i>Groundhog, second floor is clear.</i>

230
00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.364
On the move!

231
00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:18.306
Observer, we're on the move. Wrap out.

232
00:18:18.389 --> 00:18:20.558
- Evac <i>in 90 seconds.
- Roger that.</i>

233
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.476
Phoenix, get to the lz now.

234
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.770
Roger, observer. On my way.

235
00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.581
Ethan. I have to talk to you.

236
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.583
- Come on, come on.
- I have to talk to you right now!

237
00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:48.836
Just for you. Turn off your transmitter.

238
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.505
Do it, Ethan!

239
00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:03.184
Ethan!

240
00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:14.528
.Lind$ev! Moving!
-Lvioving!

241
00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:27.875
Mag!

242
00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:30.836
Ready to move.

243
00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:56.737
We evac from here.

244
00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:58.239
Get down!

245
00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:07.164
I'm out. How many rounds you got?

246
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:10.835
Enough.

247
00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:23.097
Now I'm out.

248
00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:27.935
T minus five, baby.

249
00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:42.575
Lindsey, hold on to me.

250
00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:05.181
Luther!

251
00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:07.308
Rolling!

252
00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:36.337
God! My head! What is that?

253
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.214
- What is...
-Ls she okay?

254
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:40.424
Lindsey! Let's get to the chopper.

255
00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:42.092
Zhen, get rid of the truck.

256
00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:43.511
Let's go!

257
00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.895
God! What is that? You can't hear that?

258
00:21:53.354 --> 00:21:55.815
- Oh! God!
- What's wrong with her?

259
00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:58.609
- Let's go!
- We loaded?

260
00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:01.028
Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!

261
00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:08.369
Go, go, go, go, 90!

262
00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:31.892
- Son of a bitch.
- No!

263
00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:35.312
Guys, we got company.
I'm going to try and lose them.

264
00:22:35.396 --> 00:22:36.981
Hurts so much.

265
00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:40.317
Turn it off. Please.

266
00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:58.878
Please, Ethan.

267
00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:12.182
Guys, their missiles are hot!

268
00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:18.689
Incoming! Hold on.

269
00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:32.786
Okay. That was lucky.
We only get one of those.

270
00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:44.131
Do we have a defibrillator?

271
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.093
Ethan, turn it off!

272
00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:50.054
Bring it on!

273
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.351
Ethan! What is it?
Did they put something in my head?

274
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:57.394
They injected you
with a time-release charge.

275
00:23:57.478 --> 00:23:59.021
- Do you remember that?
- No. Time-release...

276
00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:00.481
An explosive. They've activated it.

277
00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:01.982
It's gonna detonate
unless we fry the charge,

278
00:24:02.066 --> 00:24:03.233
-which is what we're gonna do.
- No, Ethan.

279
00:24:03.317 --> 00:24:04.735
Zap her like that, you'll stop her heart.

280
00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:07.404
Then I'll zap her again
and bring her back.

281
00:24:07.488 --> 00:24:08.572
Do it!

282
00:24:08.656 --> 00:24:10.824
Guys! They're firing another one!

283
00:24:18.582 --> 00:24:20.250
- Ethan!
- Zhen!

284
00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:22.836
Zhen, hold on. Hold on, hold on!

285
00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:47.528
- I want you to set it for 150.
-150.

286
00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:49.363
Lindsey, I'm gonna short out
the explosive in your head.

287
00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:51.865
- You're gonna be okay.
- It'll need 30 seconds.

288
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.034
Damn it.

289
00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:56.286
- Twenty-five seconds!
- Come on.

290
00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.205
We're almost there.

291
00:25:01.792 --> 00:25:03.794
- They have us locked.
- Twenty seconds.

292
00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:06.714
Hold on.

293
00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:25.065
I got them!

294
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.651
- Ten seconds.
- Almost there. Almost there.

295
00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:29.319
Give me the paddles.

296
00:25:29.403 --> 00:25:31.905
Ethan. Thank you.

297
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.233
Shit.

298
00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:46.480
Hey.

299
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.358
Hey.

300
00:26:56.949 --> 00:26:58.492
How did it go?

301
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.998
I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.

302
00:27:05.582 --> 00:27:07.209
I'm just tired.

303
00:27:36.155 --> 00:27:38.824
<i>I read your training brief
on agent farris.</i>

304
00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:41.368
The words you used were
"beyond capable."

305
00:27:41.451 --> 00:27:42.828
That still stand, Mr. hunt?

306
00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:45.289
- Mr. brassel...
- Does it stand?

307
00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:47.249
Yes, sir, it does.

308
00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:50.586
Because we've got a corpse downstairs
that says otherwise.

309
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:52.379
Killed by a detonator

310
00:27:52.462 --> 00:27:55.716
implanted in her skull
through the nasal cavity.

311
00:27:56.842 --> 00:28:00.012
Mr. brassel, it's unacceptable to judge
agent farris' competence based...

312
00:28:00.095 --> 00:28:02.222
It's unacceptable
that chocolate makes you fat,

313
00:28:02.306 --> 00:28:04.349
but I've eaten my share.
And guess what?

314
00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:06.810
Now, I approved agent farris'
surveillance op

315
00:28:06.894 --> 00:28:09.062
based on your evaluations, Mr. hunt,

316
00:28:09.146 --> 00:28:11.565
of a woman
who allowed herself to be captured.

317
00:28:11.648 --> 00:28:14.651
So you go to recover her.
You encounter a dozen men.

318
00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:16.403
You don't grab any of them?

319
00:28:16.486 --> 00:28:20.157
Our objective, Mr. brassel,
was to recover agent farris.

320
00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:23.243
Davian employs a cellular structure
at his organization.

321
00:28:23.327 --> 00:28:25.412
The men there
more than likely had no information...

322
00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:28.540
Who's drawing these conclusions?
Ls it you?

323
00:28:28.624 --> 00:28:31.793
- I am, sir. Based upon...
-L'm not on you yet.

324
00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:35.005
You allowed farris
to board your chopper without a scan.

325
00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:37.174
That explosive device
could have taken you all out.

326
00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:41.762
There is one reason that you are sitting
here before me today, and that is luck.

327
00:28:41.845 --> 00:28:46.141
Because your operation was
poorly conceived and executed worse.

328
00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:48.560
- Two laptops were recovered...
-L'm aware of that.

329
00:28:48.644 --> 00:28:50.020
We've talked to tech services.

330
00:28:50.103 --> 00:28:52.481
They doubt
if they can reconstitute the drives.

331
00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:55.859
"Crispy," I believe,
is what they called them. Worthless.

332
00:28:55.943 --> 00:28:58.237
Mr. brassel,
as operation manager of this office,

333
00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.780
- I have the authority...
- Excuse me.

334
00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:02.950
Did you just throw a title at me,
Mr. musgrave?

335
00:29:03.033 --> 00:29:06.411
I don't care if your daddy plays golf
with the president.

336
00:29:06.495 --> 00:29:09.623
This is intelligence.
So far I haven't seen any.

337
00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:12.876
You think this op was worth the risk,
Mr. hunt.

338
00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:16.421
What do you know about Owen Davian?

339
00:29:17.464 --> 00:29:20.008
He was the one
who brought gas centrifuge technology

340
00:29:20.092 --> 00:29:22.177
to Korea from Pakistan.

341
00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:26.473
He was also the man who sold toxin
five to the armahad Republic jihad.

342
00:29:26.848 --> 00:29:31.144
He is a man who provides,
provides, provides!

343
00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:36.149
And he remains invisible.
He's a goddamn invisible man.

344
00:29:36.233 --> 00:29:39.194
Wells, not Ellison,
in case you want to be cute again.

345
00:29:39.278 --> 00:29:41.071
We can't find him.

346
00:29:42.197 --> 00:29:45.659
He knows it. It's emboldened him.

347
00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:49.538
I've been trying to bring Davian down
since the day that I got here.

348
00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:50.831
Do you know what I've got for it?

349
00:29:50.914 --> 00:29:53.166
It's never been confirmed
the toxin five theft was Davian.

350
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.296
Mr. musgrave, please don't interrupt me
when I'm asking rhetorical questions.

351
00:29:57.379 --> 00:29:59.506
Your operation has achieved one thing.

352
00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:02.843
You have reminded Davian
that he is winning.

353
00:30:04.303 --> 00:30:07.306
And now, if you'll excuse me,
i have to go inform Mr. and Mrs. farris

354
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:11.310
that their baby girl was killed
in a head-on collision on i-95.

355
00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:15.897
<i>I stand here today deeply saddened</i>

356
00:30:16.189 --> 00:30:18.984
by the death of one of god's children,

357
00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:21.820
Lindsey Elizabeth farris.

358
00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:27.367
It is always startling when the lord
takes one of our young so unexpectedly.

359
00:30:28.452 --> 00:30:33.540
<i>Be aggressive. Come on. Stay focused.
Keep your knees bent. Good. Good.</i>

360
00:30:33.623 --> 00:30:35.709
<i>Now, to fire the lock,
the extractor has to be...</i>

361
00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:37.753
<i>That bag's not going to hit you back.
Hit harder.</i>

362
00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:40.255
<i>Don't rely on your sights.
Keep your eyes dead on the target...</i>

363
00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:41.965
<i>Attack me. Come on.</i>

364
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:45.177
<i>Don't ever release the firing pin
unless the extractors.</i> ..

365
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.387
<i>Good. There you go. Good.</i>

366
00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:51.975
<i>Identify the target. Point and shoot.
It's very simple. You point and shoot.</i>

367
00:30:52.059 --> 00:30:53.143
<i>Stay focused.</i>

368
00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:56.271
<i>Miss farris, you know
how many recruits I've trained.</i>

369
00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:58.231
<i>I'm proud to say that you are the first</i>

370
00:30:58.315 --> 00:31:00.984
<i>that I've recommended
for active field duty.</i>

371
00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:02.444
<i>Congratulations.</i>

372
00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:03.945
<i>Am I ready?</i>

373
00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:11.244
Yes?

374
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.413
<i>Is this Mr. Kelvin?</i>

375
00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:17.834
Yes. Who is this?

376
00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:20.253
<i>L'm calling from Norfolk mail service.</i>

377
00:31:20.337 --> 00:31:22.798
<i>Lindsey farris
rents a post office box here.</i>

378
00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:24.508
<i>She sent you a piece of mail from Berlin</i>

379
00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:26.510
<i>and asked us to call you
when it arrived.</i>

380
00:31:26.593 --> 00:31:28.512
<i>It came this morning.</i>

381
00:31:32.808 --> 00:31:34.226
Thank you.

382
00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:40.107
- This right here.
- Thanks.

383
00:31:57.499 --> 00:31:58.834
<i>It's a microdot.</i>

384
00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.211
A microdot with nothing on it.
This is unusual.

385
00:32:01.294 --> 00:32:03.338
Lindsey wouldn't send me
a blank microdot.

386
00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:05.006
I'm telling you, man, there's no image.

387
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.425
Then you're not looking
in the right place.

388
00:32:06.508 --> 00:32:08.009
Where the hell am I supposed to look?

389
00:32:08.093 --> 00:32:09.553
There's not much square footage
to this thing.

390
00:32:09.636 --> 00:32:11.096
Why would Lindsey send me
a blank microdot?

391
00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:12.973
I don't know.
Why would Lindsey send you anything?

392
00:32:13.056 --> 00:32:15.767
You were her instructor,
not her handler.

393
00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:19.479
Listen, man.
I don't mean to cross the line,

394
00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:23.525
but was there something going on
between you two?

395
00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.318
You and Lindsey.

396
00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:28.363
Lindsey was like my little sister.

397
00:32:28.905 --> 00:32:30.407
And you never

398
00:32:31.408 --> 00:32:34.244
slept with your little sister, right?

399
00:32:37.247 --> 00:32:40.000
Hey, brother,
if I don't ask you, who will?

400
00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:42.627
Maybe it's magnetic. The microdot.

401
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.130
Well, that's old school.

402
00:32:45.213 --> 00:32:48.717
If she was in a hurry and only had
access to black-market gear, maybe.

403
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.052
- Could you get the tools to read it?
- I might know a guy.

404
00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:53.555
- Magnetic means encrypted.
- Yeah, I know that.

405
00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:56.183
Yeah. Be right there.

406
00:32:56.683 --> 00:32:59.478
The thing about Lindsey is
she was brand-new.

407
00:32:59.728 --> 00:33:02.898
She was sweet.
Remember when you were sweet?

408
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:06.526
- Can you remember that far back?
- Yeah, well, barely.

409
00:33:06.902 --> 00:33:10.405
In Germany,
you asked me what it is I see in Julia.

410
00:33:10.864 --> 00:33:13.950
What I see in Julia
is life before all this.

411
00:33:14.701 --> 00:33:16.411
And it's good.

412
00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:20.165
Benji, what have you got?

413
00:33:20.248 --> 00:33:22.501
Well, these hard drive platters
are just fried.

414
00:33:22.584 --> 00:33:24.377
- Yeah.
- You know, they made a mess of them.

415
00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:25.879
It's just like...
There's holes in them and stuff.

416
00:33:25.962 --> 00:33:27.881
And it's got scorched
all the way through. And then...

417
00:33:27.964 --> 00:33:29.549
Look, this one's got
a hole in it and stuff.

418
00:33:29.633 --> 00:33:30.926
I can't believe. I can't even look at it.

419
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:33.220
- Benji. Did you recover anything?
- Yes. Yes.

420
00:33:33.303 --> 00:33:36.223
Despite the aforementioned conditions
of the hard drive you brought back,

421
00:33:36.306 --> 00:33:40.894
I managed to recover
portions of two dozen e-mail files.

422
00:33:40.977 --> 00:33:42.521
Also made what I believe to be

423
00:33:42.604 --> 00:33:45.607
a thoroughly
promotion-worthy breakthrough.

424
00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:49.486
Your Mr. Davian is going
to arrive in Rome the day after tomorrow

425
00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:52.656
and attend a function
at one Vatican city.

426
00:33:52.739 --> 00:33:54.908
What the hell is Davian
doing at the Vatican?

427
00:33:54.991 --> 00:33:57.035
It's all got to do
with the "rabbit's foot."

428
00:33:57.118 --> 00:33:58.245
Rabbit's foot?

429
00:33:58.328 --> 00:34:00.038
Yeah, well,
I'm assuming it's like a code word

430
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:02.290
for something he's about to sell
to an unspecified buyer,

431
00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:06.002
for $850 million, by the way.
Or maybe it's not a code word.

432
00:34:06.086 --> 00:34:08.797
Maybe it's just a really,
really expensive bunny appendage.

433
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.423
You have no idea what it is?

434
00:34:10.507 --> 00:34:13.260
It's interesting. I used to have
this professor at Oxford, okay?

435
00:34:13.343 --> 00:34:16.471
Dr. wickham, his name was,
and he was like this massive, fat guy.

436
00:34:16.555 --> 00:34:18.932
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...

437
00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:20.809
You know... well, I won't tell you
what we used to call him.

438
00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:23.645
He taught biomolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,

439
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.772
and he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen

440
00:34:25.855 --> 00:34:29.025
with this story about how the world
would eventually be eviscerated

441
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:30.485
by technology.

442
00:34:30.569 --> 00:34:34.072
You see, it was inevitable
that a compound would be created,

443
00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:36.700
which he referred to as the "anti-god."

444
00:34:36.783 --> 00:34:39.035
It was like an accelerated mutator,
a sort of, you know,

445
00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:42.247
like an unstoppable force
of destructive power

446
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.082
that would just lay waste to everything.

447
00:34:44.165 --> 00:34:46.376
To buildings and parks
and streets and children

448
00:34:46.459 --> 00:34:49.004
and ice cream parlors, you know?

449
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.965
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organization,

450
00:34:52.048 --> 00:34:55.760
willing to spend this amount of money
on a mystery tech,

451
00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:59.222
I always assume it's the anti-god.

452
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.602
End-of-the-world kind of stuff,
you know?

453
00:35:05.312 --> 00:35:08.481
But, no, I don't have any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.

454
00:35:08.565 --> 00:35:10.942
- Did you brief musgrave on this?
- Who, me? No, not yet.

455
00:35:11.026 --> 00:35:12.736
- Good. Don't.
- What?

456
00:35:12.819 --> 00:35:14.571
- Don't tell anyone about this.
- This took me ages.

457
00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:16.072
If something goes wrong
with the operation,

458
00:35:16.156 --> 00:35:18.617
I want musgrave to have deniability.

459
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.328
- That's great work, Benji.
- What operation?

460
00:35:22.662 --> 00:35:24.581
That look in your eye
is a pain in my ass.

461
00:35:24.664 --> 00:35:26.583
You know that, right?

462
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:30.503
<i>Any available resident to pediatrics.</i>

463
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:33.882
<i>Any available resident to pediatrics.</i>

464
00:35:35.759 --> 00:35:38.553
<i>Rehabilitative care, call the pharmacy.</i>

465
00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:42.349
<i>Rehabilitative care, call the...</i>

466
00:35:43.266 --> 00:35:45.352
I have to go away again.

467
00:35:46.061 --> 00:35:49.856
On business. Two days.

468
00:35:51.191 --> 00:35:52.525
Two days?

469
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:54.778
Yeah.

470
00:36:01.368 --> 00:36:03.370
Ethan, what's going on?

471
00:36:05.038 --> 00:36:07.582
I keep thinking you just need time

472
00:36:10.043 --> 00:36:12.921
to tell me whatever it is that it's...

473
00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:19.552
But nothing in my mind makes sense.

474
00:36:22.222 --> 00:36:23.390
Yeah.

475
00:36:27.394 --> 00:36:28.937
What's wrong?

476
00:36:36.903 --> 00:36:39.197
What are you not telling me?

477
00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:08.101
I need to ask you for something.

478
00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:10.645
And it's the most...

479
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.948
I need you to trust me.

480
00:37:24.617 --> 00:37:26.494
Of course I trust you.

481
00:37:30.957 --> 00:37:34.586
Am I ever going to be able
to understand what this is?

482
00:37:37.964 --> 00:37:40.008
I need you to trust me.

483
00:37:46.139 --> 00:37:47.307
Yes.

484
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:50.143
I trust you.

485
00:37:53.313 --> 00:37:54.522
Is it...

486
00:37:55.523 --> 00:37:57.317
Tell me it's real.

487
00:38:02.822 --> 00:38:04.199
I mean us.

488
00:38:05.784 --> 00:38:07.494
Tell me it's real.

489
00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:11.664
Follow me.

490
00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.542
<i>The vows you're about to take</i>

491
00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:18.213
are not to be taken
without careful thought and prayer.

492
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.259
This love is not to be diminished
by difficult circumstances

493
00:38:23.343 --> 00:38:26.513
and it is only to be dissolved by death.

494
00:38:28.473 --> 00:38:30.350
Do you have the rings?

495
00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:31.810
Yeah.

496
00:38:46.199 --> 00:38:47.909
Repeat after me.

497
00:38:54.707 --> 00:38:57.001
I, Julia Anne Meade...

498
00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:01.256
"I, Julia Anne Meade..."

499
00:39:01.714 --> 00:39:04.843
...hereby take Ethan Matthew hunt...

500
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.555
"...hereby take Ethan Matthew hunt..."

501
00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:11.349
...to be my lawfully wedded husband.

502
00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:14.394
"...to be my lawfully wedded husband."

503
00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:33.705
Tomorrow may be the only time
we can predict

504
00:39:33.788 --> 00:39:35.373
where Owen Davian is going to be.

505
00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:37.000
Charity event. Vatican city.

506
00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:40.128
Our mission is to get in
and kidnap Davian.

507
00:39:40.253 --> 00:39:42.630
I don't know why he's so happy.

508
00:39:42.922 --> 00:39:46.259
I did remind him
that the Vatican is the Vatican.

509
00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:50.430
A 109-acre sovereign state
in the middle of Rome,

510
00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:54.142
surrounded by a 60-foot wall,
which is monitored 24/7,

511
00:39:54.267 --> 00:39:56.728
with over 200 cctv cameras.

512
00:39:57.937 --> 00:40:00.315
That's not even
what makes it a challenge.

513
00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:04.611
Getting Davian is good.
But getting his buyers is even better.

514
00:40:05.278 --> 00:40:08.781
If they realize he's been grabbed,
they'll disappear.

515
00:40:08.907 --> 00:40:10.950
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

516
00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.368
No matter how we grab Davian,

517
00:40:12.452 --> 00:40:14.329
his clients are gonna know
he's been taken.

518
00:40:14.412 --> 00:40:17.290
No, they won't. Access point is here.

519
00:40:17.624 --> 00:40:20.668
It's a one-way street
adjacent to the Vatican wall.

520
00:40:20.793 --> 00:40:23.963
I'll need 30 seconds.
And we'll need a truck.

521
00:41:01.042 --> 00:41:02.627
Now we've pissed off
every Italian in Rome,

522
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:03.795
go do what you got to do.

523
00:41:03.878 --> 00:41:06.297
- Don't forget the smoke.
- Yeah.

524
00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:49.716
"Humpty dumpty sat on a wall."

525
00:43:03.956 --> 00:43:06.667
Alpha team, this is bravo.
Right on schedule.

526
00:43:07.502 --> 00:43:09.587
<i>We should have breach in 60.</i>

527
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.340
Roger that. Charlie team, report.

528
00:43:12.924 --> 00:43:14.967
<i>Well, I don't have anything
to report, really.</i>

529
00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:20.223
Except I think I should be right on time.

530
00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:21.390
We'll be waiting for you.

531
00:43:21.474 --> 00:43:24.227
<i>- Eta two minutes.
- Roger that.</i>

532
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.468
Charlie team, did you fire the tracer yet?

533
00:43:58.803 --> 00:44:00.179
Stand by.

534
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.113
Firing the tracer. Now.

535
00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:26.038
<i>Alpha, I'm in. T minus two minutes.</i>

536
00:44:26.164 --> 00:44:27.540
Roger that.

537
00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:31.544
Charlie team, I see you.

538
00:44:32.044 --> 00:44:34.422
<i>I'm looping the security feed.
Stand by to move.</i>

539
00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:35.882
Roger that.

540
00:44:37.633 --> 00:44:39.051
Video is looped. Go.

541
00:44:53.149 --> 00:44:55.484
Alpha team,
catacomb video taken care of?

542
00:44:55.568 --> 00:44:57.653
Taken care of. We're good to go.

543
00:45:06.078 --> 00:45:09.498
<i>- Delta team, do you copy?
- All I do is copy.</i>

544
00:45:09.749 --> 00:45:13.085
That's funny.
Get ready to move into position.

545
00:45:13.211 --> 00:45:15.671
<i>- L'm already there.
- Really?</i>

546
00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:19.842
<i>Eta 30 seconds.</i>

547
00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:21.552
See you in 30.

548
00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:32.521
Alpha team moving into position.

549
00:45:32.605 --> 00:45:34.440
Bravo standing by for transmission.

550
00:45:36.442 --> 00:45:37.610
Transmitting.

551
00:45:40.947 --> 00:45:42.281
Got you.

552
00:45:57.046 --> 00:45:58.547
Miss onia demea.

553
00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:01.259
I should be on the list. Thank you.

554
00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:03.719
I'm sorry. Your name is not here.

555
00:46:03.803 --> 00:46:05.680
There must be some mistake.

556
00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:15.690
Miss demea?

557
00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:18.025
Just a minute.

558
00:46:54.186 --> 00:46:55.688
She made it.

559
00:47:17.209 --> 00:47:18.669
We have a photo opportunity.

560
00:47:19.128 --> 00:47:21.797
<i>Just give me the word. I'm standing by.</i>

561
00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:23.549
Delta, ready for upload.

562
00:47:40.483 --> 00:47:42.568
Delta team, download good.

563
00:47:53.746 --> 00:47:56.499
Listen, man, I didn't mean to be
so cavalier the other day

564
00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:58.125
about you getting engaged.

565
00:47:58.209 --> 00:48:00.878
I know that. Thanks.

566
00:48:03.756 --> 00:48:06.926
But a normal relationship
isn't viable for people like us.

567
00:48:07.009 --> 00:48:09.845
- I don't agree with that.
- Then I'm smarter than you.

568
00:48:09.929 --> 00:48:12.431
I'm going up. I agree with Luther.

569
00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:16.519
We can't have real relationships.
But you see, I love that.

570
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.671
Twenty-three months.
That's as long as it'll last

571
00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:46.715
when you got the baggage we do
and the lifestyle we got.

572
00:48:46.799 --> 00:48:48.801
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

573
00:48:49.802 --> 00:48:52.638
Look at me.
I know what I'm talking about.

574
00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:55.724
And you know
i know what I'm talking about.

575
00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:09.280
Wait here.

576
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.595
Davian just picked up a briefcase.

577
00:49:32.678 --> 00:49:34.430
We're going to have to
move sooner than we thought.

578
00:49:34.513 --> 00:49:38.392
- Can <i>you identify who made the</i> drop?
<i>- Negative. How close are you guys?</i>

579
00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:40.561
We're just printing now.

580
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:02.124
I'm not proud of it.
I'm not happy about it,

581
00:50:02.208 --> 00:50:04.043
but I've lived with women a few times,

582
00:50:04.126 --> 00:50:06.253
and it doesn't ever make it to two years.

583
00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:08.130
- You can't.
- Thanks for the advice,

584
00:50:08.214 --> 00:50:10.758
but it's different for me
than it is for you, you know?

585
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.843
-L'm not in the field anymore.
- Oh, okay.

586
00:50:12.927 --> 00:50:15.179
Here's a retirement present.

587
00:50:18.265 --> 00:50:21.894
In our job, there's always going to be
something between you and a woman.

588
00:50:21.977 --> 00:50:23.187
Always.

589
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:25.523
- Luther, listen.
- Dishonesty.

590
00:50:25.606 --> 00:50:28.317
A dishonesty that poisons everything.

591
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.069
I think I need to tell you something...

592
00:50:30.152 --> 00:50:33.072
Stop talking. This isn't about you, Ethan.

593
00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:37.743
And whoever this girl is, you're going to
end up messing up her life, too.

594
00:50:37.826 --> 00:50:39.286
Don't do it.

595
00:50:40.663 --> 00:50:43.415
Jules and I got married two days ago.

596
00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:47.169
Congratulations.

597
00:50:48.128 --> 00:50:50.589
Thanks. Thanks.

598
00:50:55.302 --> 00:50:58.180
- He's walking. I'm going in.
- Roger <i>that.</i>

599
00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:00.891
I'm on my way.

600
00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.439
Ma'am. I need you to step back.

601
00:51:07.523 --> 00:51:09.441
No. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

602
00:51:09.525 --> 00:51:11.944
I always spill red wine
on my white custom-made shirt.

603
00:51:12.027 --> 00:51:15.364
- Okay. Step back.
-Lt's fine. It's fine. Bathroom.

604
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:19.535
Tell me you're on your way.

605
00:51:19.618 --> 00:51:21.328
I'm on the move.

606
00:51:30.379 --> 00:51:31.547
Move it. Come on.

607
00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:37.136
His bodyguards
are checking out the bathroom.

608
00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:39.513
I'm almost there.

609
00:52:20.304 --> 00:52:21.472
He's going in.

610
00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:51.418
Quiet. Read this.

611
00:52:51.543 --> 00:52:52.836
Slowly.

612
00:52:54.755 --> 00:52:56.048
Read it.

613
00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:01.220

The guard's on his way.</i>

626
00:53:38.424 --> 00:53:39.967

Sir, is everything all right?

00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:55.315
Everything is not all right.

I'm fine. Wait outside.

636
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.364
See you in the sewer.

637
00:54:52.164 --> 00:54:55.501
- She's sorry about your shirt.
- That's no problem.

638
00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:02.132
Her hotel has laundry service,
and she'll happily take care of it.

639
00:55:02.216 --> 00:55:03.550
You want to wash my shirt?

640
00:55:03.634 --> 00:55:06.178
What are we going to do
while we're waiting in your hotel room,

641
00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:07.596
and I'm not wearing my shirt?

642
00:55:11.767 --> 00:55:13.685
She'll think of something.

643
00:55:14.603 --> 00:55:16.230
She would like to drive.

644
00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:17.856
Follow me to the hotel.

645
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.775
Sir, would you like us
to watch the case?

646
00:55:19.858 --> 00:55:20.943
No.

647
00:55:22.277 --> 00:55:24.154
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

648
00:56:02.526 --> 00:56:05.028
- What's up?
- Nothing. What's up with you?

649
00:56:05.112 --> 00:56:06.405
Nothing.

650
00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.133
Blow the car.

651
00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:30.262
Oh. It's such a nice car.

652
00:56:30.345 --> 00:56:32.598
And yet, do it.

<i>Mr. musgrave to see you.</i>

657

Send him in.

658
00:57:06.924 --> 00:57:10.677
Ethan hunt and his team
just grabbed Owen Davian in Rome.

659
00:57:10.802 --> 00:57:14.222
They're headed back now.
I thought you should know.

660
00:57:14.848 --> 00:57:17.142
You were aware of this operation?

661
00:57:19.227 --> 00:57:20.646
Yes, I was.

662
00:57:21.563 --> 00:57:23.190
Then good work.

663
00:57:26.902 --> 00:57:28.278
Thank you.

664
00:58:02.521 --> 00:58:04.564
You're dead, Mr. Davian.

665
00:58:09.277 --> 00:58:11.154
There were witnesses.

666
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:16.743
That was you in the bathroom.

667
00:58:16.827 --> 00:58:18.578
Now, you're going to tell us everything.

668
00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:21.206
Every buyer you've worked with.
Every organization.

669
00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:22.582
What the hell is your name?

670
00:58:22.666 --> 00:58:24.835
Names, contacts, inventory lists.

671
00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:27.796
You have a wife, girlfriend?

672
00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.092
It's up to you how this goes.

673
00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:35.095
Because you know
what I'm going to do next?

674
00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:37.556
I'm going to find her, whoever she is,

675
00:58:37.639 --> 00:58:40.934
I'm going to find her,
and I'm going to hurt her.

676
00:58:44.604 --> 00:58:46.565
You were apprehended carrying details

677
00:58:46.648 --> 00:58:49.693
of the location of something
code named the rabbit's foot.

678
00:58:49.776 --> 00:58:53.530
I'm going to make her bleed, and cry,
and call out your name.

679
00:58:53.613 --> 00:58:57.367
And you're not going to be
able to do shit. You know why?

680
00:58:58.869 --> 00:58:59.953
What is the rabbit's foot?

681
00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:02.330
Because you're going to be
this close to dead.

682
00:59:02.414 --> 00:59:03.582
And who is the buyer?

683
00:59:03.665 --> 00:59:07.210
And then I'm going to kill you
right in front of her.

684
00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:10.589
- L'm going to ask you one more time.
- What's your name?

685
00:59:10.672 --> 00:59:12.174
- What is the rabbit's foot?
- Who are you?

686
00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:13.341
And who is the buyer?

687
00:59:13.425 --> 00:59:15.802
You don't have any idea
what the hell is going on, do you?

688
00:59:15.886 --> 00:59:20.348
I mean, you saw what I did to your little
blonde friend at the factory, right?

689
00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:25.854
Well, that was nothing. That was

690
00:59:27.939 --> 00:59:29.107
fun.

691
00:59:33.111 --> 00:59:34.613
That was fun.

692
01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.729
What is the rabbit's foot?

693
01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:17.155
- Ethan!
- What is the rabbit's foot?

694
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.032
Ethan, stop!

695
01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:20.575
What is it?

696
01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:23.286
Don't do it!

697
01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:26.498
- Ethan!
- What is the rabbit's foot?

698
01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:29.751
You tell me!

699
01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:31.503
Ethan, stop! Don't do it.

700
01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:33.797
This isn't you, man! This isn't you!

701
01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:36.675
We can use him, Ethan! You know that!

702
01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:45.058
No, Ethan! Don't do it!

703
01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:48.270
Please, stop!

704
01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:21.136
What I'm selling,

705
01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:23.847
and who I'm selling to,

706
01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:29.728
is the last thing
you should be concerned about,

707
01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.440
Ethan.

708
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:34.960
Ethan, we got it. Lindsey's microdot.

709
01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.212
It's a video file.

710
01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:44.594
<i>Ethan, I don't know what they've
told you. I don't know what you think.</i>

711
01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.304
<i>Just listen to me.</i>

712
01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:48.932
<i>Brassel sent me to Germany
to surveil an exchange,</i>

713
01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:51.101
<i>to ID a man named Owen Davian.</i>

714
01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:53.937
<i>I tagged his phone,
and I intercepted a transmission.</i>

715
01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.399
<i>I traced the call through the
imf network, and this is what came up.</i>

716
01:02:57.482 --> 01:03:00.610
<i>The call to Davian
came from brassel's office.</i>

717
01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:04.364
<i>It's brassel.
I think he's working with Davian.</i>

718
01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.449
<i>I think I'm being set up...</i>

719
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.923
Ethan!

720
01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:56.082
You all right?

721
01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.633
Someone call for help!

722
01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:09.012
Does anyone have a cell phone?

723
01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.339
Everybody, get down!

724
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:48.218
Get down! Get down, get down!
Everybody, get down!

725
01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.986
- There's a woman down.
- I see her.

726
01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:26.798
Get down! Get down! Stay down!

727
01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:30.677
Everybody, get down! Get down!
Stay down!

728
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.137
Get down!

729
01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:36.766
Open up!

730
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:39.185
Open up! I need the prisoner!

731
01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:56.703
Oh, my god!

732
01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:59.789
It's really bleeding.
Don't leave me, okay?

733
01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:01.833
Don't worry. I'm right here.

734
01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:04.294
Ethan, there's a g36 in the truck!

735
01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:05.462
I know! I know!

736
01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.079
Turn the drone around.
There's an imf agent in the truck.

737
01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:48.880
Ethan! Get out of the truck!

738
01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:57.764
Ethan, move!

739
01:09:08.186 --> 01:09:10.605
- Hello?
- Rick, this is Ethan. Ls Julia home?

740
01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:13.775
Hey, man. Look, I hope you're not mad
I'm here. Lt'sjust...

741
01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:15.193
Rick, I'm not mad. Ls Julia home?

742
01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:17.236
I tried her cell phone,
and there was no answer.

743
01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:21.407
No. Sorry.
Hey, did your friend find you?

744
01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:24.619
Which friend?

745
01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:27.372
<i>I don't know. Just some English guy.</i>

746
01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:31.000
Rick, what did you tell him?

747
01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:33.961
<i>Look, it's all good, man.
I told him I didn't know where you were,</i>

748
01:09:34.045 --> 01:09:37.548
<i>and Julia might, and he should
just try her at the hospital.</i>

749
01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:40.385
Hello?

750
01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:49.060
- All right, see you tomorrow, Sally.
- All right. Good night, honey.

751
01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:59.070
<i>Hi. It's Julia.
Please leave me a message...</i>

752
01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:10.581
<i>...at 4:00 today, the chesapeake bay
bridge is closed in both directions.</i>

753
01:10:10.665 --> 01:10:12.500
- Sixth floor.
- Sally, this is Ethan.

754
01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:14.669
- I need to talk to Julia.
- Hey, honey.

755
01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:16.504
She just went downstairs.
I'll transfer you.

756
01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:38.693
Damn it!

757
01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:40.611
Excuse me.

758
01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:43.072
L was wondering if you knew
where I might find this patient.

759
01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:45.783
Probably not. But I'll know who can.

760
01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:52.540
What's that?

761
01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:09.807
Sally. Where's Julia?

762
01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:12.685
- Where's Julia?
- I think she left.

763
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:15.021
Have you tried the east building?

764
01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:23.488
- Has Julia left yet?
- I haven't seen her.

765
01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:25.823
- Mike, Mike. Have you seen Julia?
- Hey, you okay?

766
01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:27.492
- Have you seen Julia?
- No.

767
01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:33.831
Watch it, buddy!

768
01:11:44.509 --> 01:11:47.094
<i>- Jules?
- You hung me outside of an airplane.</i>

769
01:11:47.178 --> 01:11:49.013
<i>You can always tell
someone's character</i>

770
01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:51.641
<i>by the way they treat those
they don't need to treat well.</i>

771
01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:55.645
<i>- If you hurt her,</i> I <i>swear...
- Don't threaten me. Just don't.</i>

772
01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:59.607
<i>The briefcase I picked up in Rome,
the one you took from me,</i>

773
01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.818
<i>contains the location
of the rabbit's foot.</i>

774
01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:05.321
<i>You're going to get it and bring it to me.
The rabbit's foot.</i>

775
01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:08.324
<i>Ethan, you had a watch
last time I saw you.</i>

776
01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:11.202
<i>You have 48 hours,
starting on my mark.</i>

777
01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:12.537
Wait, wait, wait.

778
01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.705
<i>Now, call me at this number
when you have it.</i>

779
01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:17.542
<i>- Just wait.
- Julia's life for the rabbit's foot.</i>

780
01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:21.045
<i>- You have 48 hours, or she dies.
- Wait! Wait. Wait.</i>

781
01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:28.052
<i>Condition 1-116. All units on scene.</i>

782
01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:30.096
We need you to come with us.

783
01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:32.557
Just... Pete, what the hell is this?

784
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.351
Sorry about that, Mr. hunt.
We were told to bring you in.

785
01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:37.603
<i>- Okay.
- Get ready to transport.</i>

786
01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:39.480
Whoa. Hey. Just not right now.

787
01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:41.983
- Just tell them you came and that...
- Ethan. Get in.

788
01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:45.486
We don't want to use force here,
and you know we will. Ethan, get in.

789
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:47.822
- Tell them that you came here...
- Ethan!

790
01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:50.074
...and that I left already, okay?

791
01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.163
Freeze!

792
01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:59.584
Ethan, stop! Stop, Ethan!

793
01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:15.433
Yeah. Get his hands.

794
01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:46.255
I reviewed the transcript
of your Berlin operation.

795
01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.257
It's very interesting.

796
01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:50.426
It seems that agent farris
had some information

797
01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:53.763
she wished to share with you
but not with this agency.

798
01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.640
Something you failed to report.

799
01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:58.935
You ordered the Vatican operation
without proper approvals.

800
01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:01.479
That mission
resulted in a catastrophic attack.

801
01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:03.481
And then you fled the scene.

802
01:14:03.564 --> 01:14:06.692
Now, I am not a stranger to disrespect.

803
01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:10.404
You don't get to where I am
without developing a thick skin.

804
01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:12.657
But what I won't stand for,

805
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:16.327
what I will lose sleep over,
and I love my sleep,

806
01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:20.331
is the idea of an irresponsible
rogue agent working in my office.

807
01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:24.210
So I'm going to
slow things way down here.

808
01:14:27.838 --> 01:14:29.298
You can look at me

809
01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:32.593
with those judgmental,
incriminating eyes all you want,

810
01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:34.387
but I bullshit you not.

811
01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:38.349
I will bleed on the flag
to make sure the stripes stay red.

812
01:14:57.368 --> 01:14:59.704
I don't know what to say to you.

813
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:03.624
Brassel's right. You're out of control.

814
01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:06.377
Look at me.

815
01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:12.466
Ethan, at least show me the courtesy
of looking at me when I'm talking to you.

816
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:25.312
I intercepted Davian's call. I know he
wants the rabbit's foot for Julia's life.

817
01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:26.897
It's just...

818
01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:30.568
This is

819
01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:33.070
<i>so disappointing.</i>

820
01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:37.533
Go to Shanghai.
Feng shan apartments --1406.

821
01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:45.791
I wish there was something I could do
to help you, but...

822
01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:53.090
Take him to the holding cell.

823
01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:08.332
No, I'm on it.

824
01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:10.584
Yes, sir. There's no need to panic.
I'll get him back.

825
01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:11.752
Sir? Ethan hunt...

826
01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:13.212
I know what happened.
Give me the radio.

827
01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:16.090
This is director brassel. Ethan hunt
is attempting to escape the building.

828
01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:18.217
He's in the west cargo elevator.
He must be stopped.

829
01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.095
I want mendoza and Graham
in the situation room right away.

830
01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:22.930
I'm having the building surrounded, sir.

831
01:17:23.013 --> 01:17:24.723
I've got units posted
at all the entrances.

832
01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:28.102
<i>This is brassel again. I 'm ordering</i>
a <i>code-six lockdown. I repeat.</i>

-Lt's hunt.
- I know it's hunt.

834
01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:34.984
Hunt was flagged
on sub-basement nine.

835
01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:38.404
I want all security personnel
down there now.

836
01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:40.614
Security channel's jammed.

837
01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:43.826
Hunt must be holding down
the transmit button.

838
01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.185
You've got to be kidding me.

839
01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:24.241
<i>Last call for flight 1162 for Helsinki,

And you're flying to Shanghai?

844
01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:45.721
I don't speak Czech. I'm sorry.
Let's see about your flight.

845
01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:47.014

01:20:30.367 --> 01:20:31.744
I'm sorry.

849
01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.496
I'm sorry.

850
01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:39.752
Musgrave told us about Julia.
We're here to help.

851
01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:41.962
<i>To get your wife,
you'll need the rabbit's foot.</i>

852
01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:44.131
<i>According to the plans
from Davian's briefcase,</i>

853
01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:47.676
it's in a laboratory on the 56th floor
of the hengshan lu building.

854
01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.636
Which is a nightmare
forjust about every reason.

855
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.390
They're a Chinese military contractor.
We have no pull, no details.

856
01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.309
The good news is, whatever it is,

857
01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.686
the rabbit foot's small,
so we can steal it.

858
01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:00.522
The bad news, we got to steal it.

859
01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:04.026
From a thief's point of view,
this is worst-case scenario.

860
01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:06.320
The security guards
are all privately-contracted

861
01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:07.821
former people's liberation army.

862
01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:10.157
The only access to the lab
is by private elevator.

863
01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.951
And that can only be activated
by persons inside the lab.

864
01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:15.871
All of it surveilled by
security cameras within the building.

865
01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:17.873
What about the roof?

866
01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:21.543
Four guards full time.
Two on each rooftop.

867
01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:23.462
Langley was a cakewalk
compared to this.

868
01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.089
That's the one.

869
01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:27.966
- How tall is that building?
- Why?

870
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:30.344
It's 162 meters at the highest point.

871
01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:32.888
What about that, the building
on the left? How tall is that one?

872
01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:34.473
Says 226 meters.

873
01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:37.226
226. Distance between the buildings?

874
01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:39.144
47.55 meters across.

875
01:21:55.786 --> 01:21:56.954
Ethan?

876
01:21:57.663 --> 01:22:00.457
That's good. I think it's tall enough.

877
01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:04.128
- For what?
- A fulcrum.

878
01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:08.882
Oh, you're gonna swing...
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

879
01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:11.385
- You could bounce right off the roof.
- Yes, I could.

880
01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:13.637
Even if you made it to the rooftop,
took out the guards,

881
01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:17.391
and got the rabbit's foot, you can't just
walk out of the lobby. What's your exit?

882
01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:19.101
Base-jump off the top. I need a chute.

883
01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:21.395
Even at 162, you're pushing
minimum height for a jump.

884
01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:23.063
Chute opens any lower than that
and you're dead.

885
01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:24.231
What are you going to do?

886
01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:26.442
Land in the middle of Shanghai
and hope no one notices?

887
01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:27.818
Central park's two blocks away.

888
01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:29.820
Wait, wait, Ethan, I'm not saying
i have a better idea,

889
01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:32.406
but there's a point
where bold becomes stupid.

890
01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:34.950
Now, we don't even know
what this thing is, and you're talking

891
01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:37.911
about handing it over to a guy
who provides terrorists with information.

892
01:22:37.995 --> 01:22:40.122
Luther, of course I'm not
suggesting that we just hand it over.

893
01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:43.083
We're going to tag the rabbit's foot
so we can trace it and know where it is.

894
01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:46.086
Now, you know we can get
that gear here. I just deliver it myself.

895
01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:49.089
We contact musgrave,
have the imf trace a tag, order a raid,

896
01:22:49.173 --> 01:22:50.924
get the rabbit's foot back, grab Davian.

897
01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:53.760
Now, if I get outwith Julia, we win.

898
01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:56.680
If I don't, then...

899
01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:05.939
Look, then she's dead anyway.
And so am l.

900
01:23:07.107 --> 01:23:08.442
You know?

901
01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:12.905
Goddamn it, it's 8:11, it's 8:12.

902
01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:18.535
And we have two hours
before they kill my wife.

903
01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:21.205
Are you in or not?

904
01:23:28.712 --> 01:23:30.464
Of course we're in.

905
01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:04.581
You got 18 minutes.

906
01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:08.835
You're going to make it over there.

907
01:24:08.919 --> 01:24:12.297
You're going to find the rabbit's foot,
get back to the roof,

908
01:24:12.422 --> 01:24:14.216
radio me when you're ready to make
the jump,

909
01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:16.760
and we're going to come get you.

910
01:24:17.761 --> 01:24:19.513
Thank you for coming.

911
01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:21.765
That's my job.

912
01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.386
Batter up.

913
01:25:27.164 --> 01:25:30.208
Oh, yeah. They're freaking out.
Hit them again.

914
01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:06.263
Okay.

915
01:27:07.764 --> 01:27:08.765
<i>He made it.</i>

916
01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:10.350
He made it.

917
01:27:13.437 --> 01:27:15.272
I knew he'd make it.

918
01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:32.706
<i>I'm going in. I'll be out in five minutes.</i>

919
01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:43.258
-Lt's been 12 minutes.
- He's got five minutes left.

920
01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:46.803
If he doesn't call Davian in five minutes,
Julia's dead.

921
01:27:46.887 --> 01:27:48.305
<i>Anything?</i>

922
01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:50.849
Negative.

923
01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:53.101
<i>How about you? Any good news?</i>

924
01:27:53.185 --> 01:27:54.644
No, nothing.

925
01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:56.313
Come on, Ethan.

926
01:28:05.572 --> 01:28:07.073
What is that?

927
01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:16.541
When I was little I had a cat,
and he used to run away all the time.

928
01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:21.171
And it's just a prayer I'd say
to bring him home.

929
01:28:23.089 --> 01:28:24.674
Teach it to me.

930
01:28:26.384 --> 01:28:28.595
<i>I've got the rabbit's foot,
but I can't make it to the roof.</i>

931
01:28:28.678 --> 01:28:31.515
What the hell do you mean you can't
make it to the roof? Where are you?

932
01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:33.683
<i>Look up! Look up, look up!</i>

933
01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.730
- Oh, shit.
- He's way too low.

934
01:30:29.466 --> 01:30:32.510
- Ethan! Get in! They're coming!
- Who?

935
01:30:32.636 --> 01:30:35.305
Building security, and they're pissed.

936
01:30:37.849 --> 01:30:39.726
Okay. Go, go, 90, 90-

937
01:30:46.566 --> 01:30:48.693
how much time you got left?

938
01:30:48.985 --> 01:30:50.820
Less than two minutes.

939
01:30:57.077 --> 01:31:00.246
You gotta get us out of here.
I lost the signal.

940
01:31:02.916 --> 01:31:04.709
- You okay?
- Not yet.

941
01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:14.219
Come on. Come on.

942
01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:23.269
I don't have a signal.
I don't have a signal.

943
01:31:23.353 --> 01:31:24.562
I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it!

944
01:31:33.029 --> 01:31:34.114
Zhen!

945
01:31:36.199 --> 01:31:37.867
Damn it. I'm sorry.

946
01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:47.794
Put pressure on it.

947
01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:51.423
- Tell me when you get a signal.
- What are you doing?

948
01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:12.068
I got a signal!

949
01:32:16.406 --> 01:32:17.741
Hit redial.

950
01:32:19.826 --> 01:32:22.537
<i>You only had five seconds left.
Do you realize that?</i>

951
01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:24.956
The rabbit's foot. I have it.

952
01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:29.335
<i>The train yard at dunan zhong lu.
Wait for me there. Alone.</i>

953
01:32:32.589 --> 01:32:34.090
<i>- Yeah?
- Go secure.</i>

954
01:32:34.174 --> 01:32:35.425
We are.

955
01:32:36.509 --> 01:32:38.553
<i>I have the rabbit's foot.</i>

956
01:32:38.636 --> 01:32:40.930
- You okay?
-L'm tagging it now.

957
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:46.227
You need to run a trace.
Make sure we have eyes on this thing.

958
01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:49.314
- What's the tag?
-6-3-9-6-4-1.

959
01:32:50.273 --> 01:32:51.441
Got it.

960
01:32:54.152 --> 01:32:55.528
I see you on luang tao lu road.

961
01:32:55.612 --> 01:32:59.115
If you don't hear from me in eight hours,
you send an army after this thing.

962
01:32:59.199 --> 01:33:01.117
- Good luck.
- You, too.

963
01:33:08.458 --> 01:33:10.293
<i>- Mr. musgrave.
- Yeah.</i>

964
01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:12.587
<i>It's come to my attention
that yesterday afternoon</i>

965
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:14.172
<i>you sent a team to the far east.</i>

966
01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:16.883
We received intel that
hadaam saleen bahar

967
01:33:16.966 --> 01:33:18.259
was en route to Shanghai.

968
01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:20.678
- Hadaam saleen bahar.
- That's right.

969
01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:22.722
You know what I'd love?
I'd love to see that intel.

970
01:33:22.806 --> 01:33:25.308
<i>-L'll</i> be in my office.
- Yes, sir.

971
01:33:37.821 --> 01:33:39.322
Thanks again.

972
01:33:39.697 --> 01:33:41.699
I'll see you back home.

973
01:33:42.575 --> 01:33:43.827
Ethan.

974
01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:47.997
You know they probably plan
to kill you both.

975
01:33:49.666 --> 01:33:52.001
Then I won't see you back home.

976
01:33:53.545 --> 01:33:55.171
Better get back.

977
01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:44.554
Drink it. No questions.

978
01:35:48.117 --> 01:35:49.494
Good morning.

979
01:36:05.385 --> 01:36:06.552
Jules.

980
01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:10.598
We've put an explosive charge
in your head.

981
01:36:10.682 --> 01:36:12.809
Does that sound familiar?

982
01:36:13.476 --> 01:36:15.812
The rabbit's foot. Where is it?

983
01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:18.231
I gave it to you.

984
01:36:18.815 --> 01:36:21.025
Now, I'm going to count to 10

985
01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:24.821
and you're going to tell me
where the rabbit's foot is

986
01:36:26.155 --> 01:36:27.573
or she dies.

987
01:36:52.724 --> 01:36:56.102
Seems we have a lot to talk about.
Don't we?

988
01:36:58.938 --> 01:37:00.898
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

989
01:37:00.982 --> 01:37:03.735
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

990
01:37:03.818 --> 01:37:04.902
Where is it?

991
01:37:04.986 --> 01:37:06.362
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

992
01:37:06.446 --> 01:37:07.739
- Look at me. Stay with me.
- Seven!

993
01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:10.074
Lam going to kill you.
I swear to god I'm going to...

994
01:37:10.158 --> 01:37:12.035
- Eight!
- No, please.

995
01:37:13.828 --> 01:37:17.373
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

996
01:37:17.957 --> 01:37:21.002
I promise you. I promise you.

997
01:37:21.336 --> 01:37:24.047
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

998
01:37:25.048 --> 01:37:28.009
Listen to me. I want to help you get
whatever you want.

999
01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:31.679
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

1000
01:37:32.555 --> 01:37:34.057
No, please...

1001
01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:37.769
No.

1002
01:37:39.979 --> 01:37:41.022
No.

1003
01:37:41.356 --> 01:37:43.107
- Ten.
- Don't!

1004
01:37:59.916 --> 01:38:03.586
I pushed him as far as he can go.
I know he's not lying.

1005
01:38:03.878 --> 01:38:05.421
I understand.

1006
01:38:06.005 --> 01:38:09.217
I've got some questions
i want to ask him first.

1007
01:38:31.614 --> 01:38:33.282
It's complicated.

1008
01:38:40.164 --> 01:38:42.417
You can't just open the canister.

1009
01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:45.378
We had to make sure
you brought the real thing.

1010
01:38:45.461 --> 01:38:48.798
The rabbit's foot. Now we know.

1011
01:38:57.557 --> 01:39:00.810
Don't you touch her!
Don't you touch her!

1012
01:39:10.027 --> 01:39:13.489
Davian's translator,
his head of security.

1013
01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:17.952
Remember?
At the Vatican she failed him.

1014
01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:24.500
Ethan, Julia is still alive.

1015
01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:29.172
Davian wanted to kill you both,
but I convinced him otherwise.

1016
01:39:29.255 --> 01:39:33.134
Julia hasn't seen me.
She doesn't know anything. She's clean.

1017
01:39:33.259 --> 01:39:35.595
She can go on to have a life.

1018
01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:40.558
As long as you tell me,
what was in Lindsey's message?

1019
01:39:41.517 --> 01:39:44.395
I know she sent you a microdot
from Berlin.

1020
01:39:45.771 --> 01:39:48.274
Did Lindsey know
about me and Davian?

1021
01:39:48.357 --> 01:39:51.319
Is that why she sent the message
to you? Did you read it?

1022
01:39:51.402 --> 01:39:53.070
Did anyone else see it?

1023
01:39:53.154 --> 01:39:55.448
Did she know about the work
i was doing?

1024
01:39:55.531 --> 01:39:57.533
Could I be compromised at imf?

1025
01:39:57.617 --> 01:39:59.285
Ethan. Ethan.

1026
01:40:00.703 --> 01:40:03.080
Did she buy that brassel set her up?

1027
01:40:03.164 --> 01:40:04.916
Did she buy that?

1028
01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:07.627
You told him.

1029
01:40:08.961 --> 01:40:11.464
That's how Davian knew
Lindsey was coming.

1030
01:40:11.547 --> 01:40:13.174
You told him.

1031
01:40:15.092 --> 01:40:17.386
I thought you could get her back.

1032
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:21.098
But I wasn't gonna let brassel,
of all people, undo the work I'd done.

1033
01:40:21.182 --> 01:40:25.645
I took action, Ethan, on behalf
of the working families of our country.

1034
01:40:25.728 --> 01:40:27.146
The armed forces, the white house.

1035
01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:29.190
I'd had enough
of brassel and his sanctimony.

1036
01:40:29.273 --> 01:40:32.610
Imf executive director.
He's an affirmative action poster boy.

1037
01:40:32.693 --> 01:40:36.197
You grab Davian like he wanted,
then what?

1038
01:40:36.739 --> 01:40:38.407
Davian's a weed.

1039
01:40:40.076 --> 01:40:44.163
You cut him out, two more spring up
just like him the next day.

1040
01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:46.249
Arrest him? Then what?

1041
01:40:47.667 --> 01:40:49.085
You use him.

1042
01:40:50.545 --> 01:40:53.214
Collaborate with him.

1043
01:40:54.674 --> 01:40:56.717
And it's Christmas.

1044
01:40:58.511 --> 01:41:01.472
In 18 hours,
the rabbit's foot will be delivered

1045
01:41:01.556 --> 01:41:04.850
to its middle eastern buyer,
and we'll have credible intel to prove it.

1046
01:41:04.934 --> 01:41:07.812
Us security council will get a report
by this time tomorrow.

1047
01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:10.982
We're talking a military strike
within a week.

1048
01:41:11.357 --> 01:41:13.442
And when the sand settles,

1049
01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:16.404
our country will do what it does best.

1050
01:41:16.487 --> 01:41:19.198
Clean up. Infrastructure.

1051
01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:22.535
Democracy wins.

1052
01:41:26.872 --> 01:41:29.750
What was Lindsey's message?

1053
01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:34.088
You tell me, and Julia walks.

1054
01:41:36.632 --> 01:41:39.135
It's the only play you have left.

1055
01:41:40.469 --> 01:41:43.889
Not till I hear her voice,
know she's alive.

1056
01:41:46.017 --> 01:41:47.351
Of course.

1057
01:42:00.448 --> 01:42:01.824
Put her on.

1058
01:42:09.415 --> 01:42:11.584
- Jules?
- Ethan?

1059
01:42:11.834 --> 01:42:15.129
When we met,
there was a lake near the mountain.

1060
01:42:17.298 --> 01:42:19.300
What was the lake called?

1061
01:42:20.593 --> 01:42:21.844
<i>Vvanaka.</i>

1062
01:42:22.428 --> 01:42:24.013
<i>Please, Ethan.</i>

1063
01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:26.766
<i>- Jules.
- Ethan, I don't understand...</i>

1064
01:42:46.118 --> 01:42:47.662
Benjamin dunne.

1065
01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:49.455
Benji, it's me.

1066
01:42:49.538 --> 01:42:52.625
- Ethan.
- What? No. Really?

1067
01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:54.418
<i>Listen to me very carefully.
I need your help.</i>

1068
01:42:56.087 --> 01:42:59.340
I need to trace the location
of the last call made from this phone.

1069
01:42:59.423 --> 01:43:01.092
Look, no. Ethan. Shush.

1070
01:43:01.175 --> 01:43:02.927
<i>They're looking...
Everyone's looking for you.</i>

1071
01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:06.097
<i>Everyone I know. They're looking...
I just looked it up.</i>

1072
01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:08.015
<i>Okay, you're on
lnterpol's most wanted list.</i>

1073
01:43:08.099 --> 01:43:10.601
And that, by the way,
is a spectacular list to be on.

1074
01:43:10.685 --> 01:43:13.145
<i>Whatever happened, I'm sorry,
but I'm hanging up now right now.</i>

1075
01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:14.480
Benji, I don't have time for this.

1076
01:43:14.563 --> 01:43:16.232
What do you think happened?
I've been set up.

1077
01:43:16.315 --> 01:43:19.402
I think I like myjob. Okay? A lot.

1078
01:43:19.485 --> 01:43:21.362
All right? And you know
they're gonna be taping this call.

1079
01:43:21.654 --> 01:43:24.407
And you know you can erase it.
I'm giving you the number right now.

1080
01:43:24.490 --> 01:43:26.617
- Are you ready?
- All right. Just hang on.

1081
01:43:26.701 --> 01:43:29.078
I'm gonna lose my citizenship
because of this, you know.

1082
01:43:29.161 --> 01:43:32.039
7-3-4-4-2-5-6-4-3-6-7.

1083
01:43:32.123 --> 01:43:34.917
Okay. Wait. Okay. Hold the line, please.

1084
01:43:49.223 --> 01:43:50.850
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

1085
01:43:50.933 --> 01:43:52.184
<i>Okay-</i>

1086
01:43:52.852 --> 01:43:56.021
<i>maybe we can share a jail cell together,
you know?</i>

1087
01:43:56.105 --> 01:43:58.691
If this all goes tits up, which it will.

1088
01:43:58.774 --> 01:44:00.609
The location of that number
is Shanghai.

1089
01:44:00.693 --> 01:44:01.986
There, I just told you. Shanghai.

1090
01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:04.697
I've just aided and abetted an enemy
of the state. Fantastic. Thank you.

1091
01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:07.116
Am I close?
Use this phone to track my location.

1092
01:44:07.199 --> 01:44:09.618
Oh, you're there. Well, you're close.

1093
01:44:09.702 --> 01:44:11.495
How close?
Ls the signal in the building?

1094
01:44:11.579 --> 01:44:13.038
No, no, no. It isn't coming from there.

1095
01:44:13.122 --> 01:44:14.957
It's in a building
one mile to the northeast.

1096
01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:16.667
<i>Benji, lead me to the signal.</i>

1097
01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:32.725
<i>There is one thing. What the hell
are you doing in Shanghai?</i>

1098
01:44:32.808 --> 01:44:35.019
I'll tell you when I see you.

1099
01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:45.821
What you...
You need to go north.

1100
01:44:45.905 --> 01:44:48.282
Okay, there's a bridge.
Get to it, cross it.

1101
01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:51.744
<i>Make a left. Go three-quarters of a mile
along the river.</i>

1102
01:44:51.827 --> 01:44:53.662
I got it. I got it.

1103
01:45:29.031 --> 01:45:30.991
Good, good. That's right.
Keep going. Keep going.

1104
01:45:31.075 --> 01:45:32.493
Make your next left
and then the next one.

1105
01:45:32.576 --> 01:45:34.203
And then follow that down 1,000 yards.

1106
01:45:34.286 --> 01:45:35.996
A thousand yards.

1107
01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:39.250
<i>- Okay. Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay. Left. Left.</i>

1108
01:45:39.792 --> 01:45:41.919
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
Keep going. Keep going.

1109
01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:44.171
Okay, now look... hiya. Hi.

1110
01:45:44.255 --> 01:45:45.756
<i>Benji, where?</i>

1111
01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.133
<i>- Benji? Which way do I go?
- Now take a fight.</i>

1112
01:45:54.849 --> 01:45:56.350
Okay. Go down, left.

1113
01:45:56.725 --> 01:45:58.602
Left? I'm going left.

1114
01:46:00.479 --> 01:46:01.605
<i>Good, good.</i>

1115
01:46:01.689 --> 01:46:03.440
It's in the second building on your left.

1116
01:46:03.524 --> 01:46:05.901
The signal bearing's
plus or minus three meters

1117
01:46:05.985 --> 01:46:07.152
from the northeast corner.

1118
01:46:07.653 --> 01:46:08.946
I owe you.

1119
01:48:06.188 --> 01:48:08.148
Jules. Jules.

1120
01:48:08.774 --> 01:48:10.442
You're gonna be okay.

1121
01:48:13.445 --> 01:48:14.738
Oh, god!

1122
01:48:15.239 --> 01:48:16.323
God!

1123
01:48:26.959 --> 01:48:29.420
I've activated the charge in your head.

1124
01:48:34.883 --> 01:48:37.386
You have maybe four minutes left.

1125
01:48:46.854 --> 01:48:49.565
Didn't I tell you
she'd call out your name?

1126
01:48:55.654 --> 01:48:58.657
Ethan. Ethan.

1127
01:49:02.745 --> 01:49:03.871
No.

1128
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:10.044
Please.

1129
01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:18.218
And I told you I was going to kill you
in front of her?

1130
01:49:18.302 --> 01:49:20.888
Well, I'm going to kill her
in front of you.

1131
01:51:13.375 --> 01:51:14.543
Ethan?

1132
01:51:17.838 --> 01:51:19.339
Are you okay?

1133
01:51:20.382 --> 01:51:22.134
I don't understand
what's going on, Ethan.

1134
01:51:22.217 --> 01:51:25.179
- I know. I know. Just wait.
- What do those men want from you?

1135
01:51:25.262 --> 01:51:27.931
Why are we here?
How did you find me?

1136
01:51:29.016 --> 01:51:31.852
Please, Ethan.
What the hell is going on?

1137
01:51:31.977 --> 01:51:33.312
Are you okay?

1138
01:51:33.395 --> 01:51:37.149
Ethan, what's wrong? Okay. Oh, god.

1139
01:51:40.235 --> 01:51:44.156
I'm going to tell you everything.
You just stay with me.

1140
01:51:50.746 --> 01:51:53.707
Ethan. What's happening?
What are you looking for?

1141
01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:56.543
- We've got to get out of here.
- Not yet.

1142
01:51:58.295 --> 01:52:00.005
- They don't have one!
- What?

1143
01:52:00.088 --> 01:52:02.549
- A defibrillator.
- A defibrillator?

1144
01:52:02.633 --> 01:52:03.759
Ethan?

1145
01:52:04.509 --> 01:52:08.472
Ethan? Who are these people?
What the hell are we doing here?

1146
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:12.601
Good!

1147
01:52:14.019 --> 01:52:16.146
This is a beretta 92f.

1148
01:52:16.939 --> 01:52:18.774
It's a very accurate,
close-range weapon.

1149
01:52:18.857 --> 01:52:21.109
- Don't point it at me.
- Sorry.

1150
01:52:23.070 --> 01:52:24.488
It holds 15 rounds.

1151
01:52:24.571 --> 01:52:27.950
When the mag is empty,
the slide will lock back like this.

1152
01:52:28.033 --> 01:52:30.285
How do you know so much about this?

1153
01:52:30.369 --> 01:52:32.996
To reload, push this button.

1154
01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:34.998
The empty mag falls out

1155
01:52:35.082 --> 01:52:37.042
and you shove the other one in,

1156
01:52:37.125 --> 01:52:39.628
like the batteries in the flashlight
in the kitchen,

1157
01:52:39.711 --> 01:52:41.672
then release the slide.

1158
01:52:44.841 --> 01:52:46.885
- Why are you giving me a gun?
- There could be others.

1159
01:52:46.969 --> 01:52:48.762
If you have to use it, you stay low.

1160
01:52:48.845 --> 01:52:51.598
You identify your enemy.
Point and shoot.

1161
01:52:51.682 --> 01:52:53.267
It's very simple. Point and shoot.

1162
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:54.768
Stand back.

1163
01:52:56.478 --> 01:52:57.604
Good.

1164
01:52:58.897 --> 01:53:01.650
I have a charge in my head.
I'm going to die unless you kill me.

1165
01:53:01.733 --> 01:53:03.735
- What?
- Throw the switch on and off.

1166
01:53:03.819 --> 01:53:05.279
- Don't forget the off.
- I can't do that.

1167
01:53:05.362 --> 01:53:07.614
You can bring me back.
I'll come back.

1168
01:53:07.698 --> 01:53:09.950
- I can't.
- You have to! There's no time!

1169
01:53:10.033 --> 01:53:11.535
Now! Please!

1170
01:53:18.375 --> 01:53:20.961
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait. I love you.

1171
01:53:21.211 --> 01:53:22.587
I love you.

1172
01:54:37.746 --> 01:54:38.997
Oh, god.

1173
01:54:45.128 --> 01:54:46.630
Come on, baby.

1174
01:54:50.967 --> 01:54:54.429
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight,

1175
01:54:54.513 --> 01:54:58.141
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen.

1176
01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:07.776
Come on, baby.
I need you to come back.

1177
01:55:09.152 --> 01:55:10.779
I need you back.

1178
01:55:56.992 --> 01:55:58.326
Oh, god.

1179
01:56:07.544 --> 01:56:09.004
You did that?

1180
01:56:12.841 --> 01:56:13.967
Wow.

1181
01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:42.954
So, I was just thinking...

1182
01:56:45.373 --> 01:56:49.336
I was thinking you might want to tell me
why we're in China.

1183
01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:52.088
I know.

1184
01:56:56.176 --> 01:56:57.260
L.-

1185
01:56:59.054 --> 01:57:00.931
I work for an agency.

1186
01:57:01.973 --> 01:57:03.600
It's called imf.

1187
01:57:06.311 --> 01:57:08.313
What does that stand for?

1188
01:57:09.523 --> 01:57:11.608
Impossible mission force.

1189
01:57:12.567 --> 01:57:13.777
Shut up.

1190
01:57:14.653 --> 01:57:16.029
No, I'm not kidding.

1191
01:57:16.112 --> 01:57:20.033
You don't understand.
Everything I'm telling you is top-secret.

1192
01:57:20.116 --> 01:57:21.868
You can trust me.

1193
01:57:22.327 --> 01:57:23.620
Yeah, I know.

1194
01:57:25.038 --> 01:57:27.541
<i>Just wanna show my appreciation
for your work.</i>

1195
01:57:35.048 --> 01:57:38.969
Call it reparations for anything
i might have put you through.

1196
01:57:39.344 --> 01:57:41.471
You should know
the white house has contacted me.

1197
01:57:41.555 --> 01:57:43.932
Now, there's a job that they are

1198
01:57:44.558 --> 01:57:47.185
very interested
in speaking with you about.

1199
01:57:50.605 --> 01:57:53.066
Thank you,

1200
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:55.277
but I have a lot to think about.

1201
01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:58.446
You aren't considering quitting,
are you, Ethan?

1202
01:57:58.530 --> 01:58:01.157
I'm considering
going on my honeymoon.

1203
01:58:04.119 --> 01:58:05.287
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

1204
01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:06.496
Yeah.

1205
01:58:08.290 --> 01:58:09.874
Hey, one thing.

1206
01:58:11.418 --> 01:58:13.712
The rabbit's foot. What is it?

1207
01:58:17.132 --> 01:58:19.968
Promise me you'll stay, I'll tell you.

1208
01:58:22.554 --> 01:58:25.390
- I'll send you a postcard.
- Fair enough.
