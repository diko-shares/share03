00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,435
Can't you breathe?

2
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:31,010
Shall I get you some water?

3
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:33,665
Would you like some?

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,699
Would you like a sip?

5
00:01:41,178 --> 00:01:44,291
Here you are.

6
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,872
How you're suffering!

7
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:44,841
Your hands...

8
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:48,493
They're so cold.

9
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:20,650
They're absolutely frozen.

10
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:26,036
Are you cold?
D'you want a hot-water bottle?

11
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:28,915
I'll get you a hot-water bottle.

12
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,993
You want one?

13
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:35,694
It'll help warm you.

14
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:38,789
Is that better?

15
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,244
Don't you want it?

16
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:44,045
Put your hands like this.

17
00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:47,546
Look how cold they are.

18
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:50,383
Is that better?

19
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:18,861
The pulse...

20
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:21,706
The pulse has stopped.

21
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:23,954
- Can't you feel it?
- No.

22
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,114
It's very weak.

23
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:32,784
- Look, a tear.
- Even I wiped one away.

24
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:35,412
The suffering is over.

25
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:40,486
Not too loud. They say they can
still hear for two hours.

26
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:44,876
Let's leave them in peace then.

27
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,292
And then...

28
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:49,394
Even when they are dead
Shura.

29
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,672
They say, not to dusturb them
for two hours.

30
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:55,799
Only to cover them
with a sheet.

31
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,890
There's no pulse.
I can't feel any.

32
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:04,243
- There's no pulse.
- Perhaps we should use a mirror.

33
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:07,336
That one's too big.

34
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:10,454
Where's the smaller one?

35
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,388
Perhaps everyone

36
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:18,141
who has suffered greatly

37
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:24,562
happens to arrive at a point

38
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:28,024
in their life

39
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:33,547
when they ask themselves

40
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:38,772
why this must happen to them

41
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:40,956
and not anyone else.

42
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:47,263
And they go over and over
in their minds

43
00:33:48,744 --> 00:33:51,458
all of their own actions.

44
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:58,933
Examine their whole life

45
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:07,116
All of the suffering

46
00:34:07,117 --> 00:34:10,617
that has so crushed them.

47
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,909
And treat it as

48
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,991
a kind of price

49
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:24,514
that must be paid
for the mistakes they have made.

50
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:32,001
Later, when I became familiar
with the bible

51
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:37,662
I understood, in fact,

52
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:43,529
that each person must pay

53
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,230
not only for their own mistakes

54
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:53,382
but in a certain sense even
for those of their dearest ones.

55
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:59,164
As it says in the bible,
even unto the 3rd generation.

56
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:04,985
This will help you
to see your suffering

57
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:09,167
in a different way.

58
00:35:15,736 --> 00:35:21,573
Like when you concentrate
on the hurt of another person

59
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:24,833
who is close to you.

60
00:35:27,165 --> 00:35:33,036
Then, your own pain 
will diminish

61
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:39,912
and ease your suffering.

62
00:35:46,736 --> 00:35:50,529
I don't want your tears

63
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:56,256
to bother those who are near you.
