of its true, modest worth.

00:26:04.107 --> 00:26:08.195
But beneath your mask of logic,
I sense a fragility.

347
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.447
That worries me.

348
00:26:11.281 --> 00:26:13.951
Steel your mind, Holmes.

349
00:26:14.576 --> 00:26:15.619
I need you.

350
00:26:15.786 --> 00:26:18.205
You've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

351
00:26:18.372 --> 00:26:19.957
- And I will rise again.
<i>- Bon voyage.</i>

352
00:26:20.123 --> 00:26:21.792
Pay attention.

353
00:26:21.959 --> 00:26:25.295
Three more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

354
00:26:25.462 --> 00:26:28.507
You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

355
00:26:28.674 --> 00:26:32.219
...or, by the time you realize you
made all of this possible...

356
00:26:32.386 --> 00:26:35.639
...it'll be the last sane thought
in your head.

357
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.731
What did he want?

358
00:26:44.898 --> 00:26:46.483
Not sure.

359
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.611
But I don't think you're needed, Father.
Not for this one.

360
00:26:51.405 --> 00:26:53.365
MAN: <i>Lord Henry Blackwood...</i>

361
00:26:53.532 --> 00:26:57.953
...you are sentenced to death
for the practice of black magic...

362
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.456
...the unholy murder of five
innocent young women...

363
00:27:01.623 --> 00:27:04.042
...and the attempted murder of a sixth.

364
00:27:04.751 --> 00:27:06.712
Do you have any final words?

365
00:27:07.713 --> 00:27:09.339
Death...

366
00:27:10.382 --> 00:27:12.551
...is only the beginning.

367
00:27:23.729 --> 00:27:25.813
PRIEST: ...forever and ever. Amen.

368
00:27:47.085 --> 00:27:50.422
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

369
00:28:11.777 --> 00:28:14.780
ADLER:
London's so bleak this time of year.

370
00:28:15.614 --> 00:28:18.617
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

371
00:28:18.784 --> 00:28:21.286
I much prefer to travel in the winter.

372
00:28:23.622 --> 00:28:26.917
Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

373
00:28:27.084 --> 00:28:29.961
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...

374
00:28:30.128 --> 00:28:32.130
...and your favorite...

375
00:28:32.297 --> 00:28:34.674
...olives from the Cyclades.

376
00:28:34.841 --> 00:28:37.094
Thought we might have a little tea party.

377
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.722
And while I was setting the table,
I found this:

378
00:28:40.889 --> 00:28:42.974
A file with my name on it.

379
00:28:43.809 --> 00:28:46.144
"Theft of Velázquez portrait
from king of Spain."

380
00:28:47.145 --> 00:28:51.149
"Missing naval documents lead to
resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."

381
00:28:52.651 --> 00:28:56.321
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...

382
00:28:59.783 --> 00:29:01.910
...Hapsburg prince
to Romanov princess."

383
00:29:03.495 --> 00:29:05.997
I was simply studying your methods...

384
00:29:06.164 --> 00:29:08.125
...should the authorities
ask me to hunt you down.

385
00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:09.835
Ah.

386
00:29:10.001 --> 00:29:12.170
But I don't see my name
in any of these articles.

387
00:29:12.337 --> 00:29:14.131
But your signature was clear.

388
00:29:15.757 --> 00:29:17.759
Is that the maharajah's
missing diamond?

389
00:29:19.511 --> 00:29:21.138
Or just another souvenir?

390
00:29:21.763 --> 00:29:23.849
Let's not dwell on the past.

391
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.060
Shall we?

392
00:29:29.271 --> 00:29:31.356
By the looks of things,
you're between jobs.

393
00:29:31.523 --> 00:29:34.776
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?

394
00:29:35.193 --> 00:29:38.864
He was boring and jealous,
and he snored.

395
00:29:41.867 --> 00:29:43.660
I'm Irene Adler again.

396
00:29:43.827 --> 00:29:46.246
(FARTING)

397
00:29:51.001 --> 00:29:52.502
Thank you.

398
00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:57.883
(SNIFFING)

399
00:29:58.633 --> 00:30:00.051
I need your help.

400
00:30:00.802 --> 00:30:03.013
I need you to find someone.

401
00:30:05.474 --> 00:30:07.058
Why are you always so suspicious?

402
00:30:07.225 --> 00:30:09.728
Shall I answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

403
00:30:09.895 --> 00:30:13.899
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

404
00:30:16.818 --> 00:30:19.863
I think you'll find all the information
you need inside.

405
00:30:21.156 --> 00:30:22.866
Who are you working for?

406
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:26.244
So I'll have to find out the hard way?

407
00:30:27.412 --> 00:30:29.748
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.

408
00:30:29.915 --> 00:30:32.417
Well, consider it a wager that you will.

409
00:30:33.293 --> 00:30:35.545
Do you remember The Grand?

410
00:30:35.712 --> 00:30:37.923
They gave me our old room.

411
00:30:51.353 --> 00:30:52.687
Hold the door.

412
00:30:52.854 --> 00:30:54.731
Thanks, doctor.

413
00:31:17.295 --> 00:31:18.797
Ma'am.

414
00:31:22.467 --> 00:31:25.679
- He'll do it.
- MAN 1: Well done, Miss Adler.

415
00:31:26.596 --> 00:31:28.598
That's precisely why I hired you.

416
00:31:29.766 --> 00:31:32.352
I wager he'll have our man
within the next 24 hours.

417
00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:34.104
MAN 1: He'd better.

418
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:36.481
Reordan is the key
to what Blackwood was doing.

419
00:31:37.566 --> 00:31:39.317
He's essential to my plan.

420
00:31:39.484 --> 00:31:41.653
MAN 2: Get off out of it.

421
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.447
MAN 3: What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?

422
00:31:44.614 --> 00:31:46.616
- You scalp diver.
- Get off out of it.

423
00:31:47.659 --> 00:31:50.328
A little rifle range
would go a long way, sir...

424
00:31:50.495 --> 00:31:53.873
...rubbing the calluses
off these German bands.

425
00:31:54.624 --> 00:31:55.959
God save the queen.

426
00:31:57.127 --> 00:31:58.420
God save the queen, sir.

427
00:31:58.587 --> 00:31:59.921
MAN 2: Get off out of it.

428
00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.385
Look at you.

429
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:08.597
Why is the only woman
you've cared about a criminal?

430
00:32:08.763 --> 00:32:09.806
Are you a masochist?

431
00:32:09.973 --> 00:32:12.058
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.

432
00:32:12.225 --> 00:32:16.021
She's the only adversary
who ever outsmarted you. Twice.

433
00:32:16.187 --> 00:32:17.856
Made a proper idiot out of you.

434
00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:20.650
- Right, you've had your fun.
- What's she after, anyway?

435
00:32:20.817 --> 00:32:23.278
- It's time to press on.
- What could she possibly need?

436
00:32:23.445 --> 00:32:24.863
It doesn't matter.

437
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:28.158
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.

438
00:32:28.325 --> 00:32:31.161
She could sit on your back
and paddle you up the Thames.

439
00:32:31.328 --> 00:32:33.413
That's of no consequence to you, is it?

440
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.540
We've done our last case together.

441
00:32:35.707 --> 00:32:37.292
WATSON: I've already read it.

442
00:32:38.168 --> 00:32:40.170
Missing person:

443
00:32:40.337 --> 00:32:43.340
Luke Reordan, 4 foot 10,
red hair, no front teeth.

444
00:32:43.506 --> 00:32:44.549
Case solved.

445
00:32:44.716 --> 00:32:48.011
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.

446
00:32:48.178 --> 00:32:49.804
- Midget.
- So you agree?

447
00:32:49.971 --> 00:32:51.222
No, I don't agree.

448
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:53.975
It's more than technicality, you see.

449
00:32:54.142 --> 00:32:57.228
You're misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples.

450
00:32:57.395 --> 00:33:00.899
- I've said too much. I've upset you.
- No, I am simply stating that one has...

451
00:33:01.066 --> 00:33:02.567
What were you doing?

452
00:33:02.734 --> 00:33:05.362
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.

453
00:33:28.593 --> 00:33:31.429
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

454
00:33:31.638 --> 00:33:34.265
- Are you wearing a false...?
- False nose? No.

455
00:33:34.516 --> 00:33:36.851
- Tell me that that wasn't...
- That wasn't.

456
00:33:37.018 --> 00:33:38.228
(YELLS)

457
00:33:38.395 --> 00:33:40.855
WATSON:
Holmes. Where are you going?

458
00:33:41.731 --> 00:33:44.609
(CRASHING AND GLASS SHATTERING)

459
00:33:44.776 --> 00:33:46.277
HOLMES: Watson.

460
00:33:48.363 --> 00:33:49.698
Watson.

461
00:34:08.633 --> 00:34:12.554
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.

462
00:34:12.721 --> 00:34:16.599
Oh. My lucky day.

463
00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:19.644
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?

464
00:34:23.398 --> 00:34:25.108
Don't move.

465
00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.155
Now, what have we got here?

466
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:31.322
(ADLER GASPS)

467
00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:32.657
It's...

468
00:34:36.077 --> 00:34:37.704
Thank you.

469
00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.790
That's the Irene I know.

470
00:34:48.339 --> 00:34:49.507
WOMAN: Good boy.

471
00:35:32.884 --> 00:35:35.345
This man intrigues me, Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.

472
00:35:35.512 --> 00:35:37.889
- Which is no mean feat.
- She's intimidated.

473
00:35:38.056 --> 00:35:39.224
She's scared of him.

474
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:40.558
Yet she works for him.

475
00:35:42.268 --> 00:35:44.103
- Right.
- It's nothing to do with me...

476
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.023
...but I advise you leave the case alone.

477
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.733
Well, I may not have a choice.

478
00:35:49.943 --> 00:35:53.029
After all, I may be paying the rent
on my own soon, thanks to you.

479
00:35:53.571 --> 00:35:56.074
- Get that out of my face.
- It's not. It's in my hand.

480
00:35:56.241 --> 00:35:57.718
Get what's in your hand out of my face.

481
00:35:57.742 --> 00:35:59.035
- CLARK: Mr. Holmes?
- Clarkie.

482
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:02.330
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me at once.

483
00:36:02.497 --> 00:36:05.166
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

484
00:36:05.333 --> 00:36:07.418
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."

485
00:36:07.585 --> 00:36:09.087
No, "you" means you.

486
00:36:09.254 --> 00:36:11.673
CLARK: It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
He, uh...

487
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.174
Well...

488
00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:16.636
...it appears he's come back
from the grave, sir.

489
00:36:24.394 --> 00:36:27.397
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.

490
00:36:27.564 --> 00:36:29.440
I pronounced the man dead myself.

491
00:36:31.401 --> 00:36:32.861
What are the facts?

492
00:36:33.027 --> 00:36:36.281
Groundskeeper saw him walking
through the graveyard this morning.

493
00:36:36.906 --> 00:36:39.158
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

494
00:36:39.701 --> 00:36:43.913
- I have an appointment with Mary.
- It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

495
00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.623
Don't try that.

496
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:49.043
- The newspapers got wind of it?
- That's what we're trying to avoid.

497
00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:50.795
Certainly.

498
00:36:51.087 --> 00:36:52.422
What's the major concern?

499
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:55.049
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

500
00:36:55.216 --> 00:36:58.094
- Indeed.
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?

501
00:36:58.261 --> 00:36:59.762
Yes, as you should.

502
00:37:01.723 --> 00:37:03.808
It's a matter of professional integrity.

503
00:37:03.975 --> 00:37:07.937
No girl wants to marry a doctor
who can't tell if a man's dead or not.

504
00:37:23.995 --> 00:37:26.289
Who do you think won the match,
Clarkie?

505
00:37:26.456 --> 00:37:28.875
- Sir?
- The rugby match.

506
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.171
Your boys have done a magnificent job
obliterating any potential evidence.

507
00:37:33.338 --> 00:37:37.342
Yes. But at least they never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

508
00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:42.347
LESTRADE:
You took your time, Holmes.

509
00:37:42.513 --> 00:37:45.683
HOLMES: "And on the third day"...

510
00:37:47.852 --> 00:37:50.480
These slabs are half a ton each
if they're a pound...

511
00:37:50.647 --> 00:37:52.732
...and they're smashed open
from the inside.

512
00:37:52.899 --> 00:37:55.526
Lestrade, what of the coffin?

513
00:37:55.693 --> 00:37:59.030
- We are in the process of bringing it up.
- I see.

514
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:04.285
Hm. Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

515
00:38:06.871 --> 00:38:08.623
Anyhow, where's our witness?

516
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.083
He's over there.

517
00:38:10.249 --> 00:38:12.418
And apparently, he is cata...

518
00:38:12.585 --> 00:38:13.628

519
00:38:13.795 --> 00:38:15.296

- Yes.

quivering milkmaids, you're on double-time.

00:38:31.562 --> 00:38:33.231
Hello.

525
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.984
It's all right.

526

I'm a doctor.

527
00:38:48.037 --> 00:38:50.498
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.

528
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:55.336
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

529
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:56.963
Well?

530
00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.258
- Well?
- You pronounced him dead.

531
00:39:00.425 --> 00:39:02.927
He had no pulse.

532
00:39:07.765 --> 00:39:09.267
MAN: Ready.

533
00:39:10.101 --> 00:39:11.602
Down.

534
00:39:23.614 --> 00:39:25.116
Good Lord.

535
00:39:26.784 --> 00:39:28.286
That's not Blackwood.

536
00:39:29.954 --> 00:39:33.291
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

537
00:39:37.879 --> 00:39:39.297
Time of death?

538
00:39:41.466 --> 00:39:43.843
Diptera is...

539
00:39:44.719 --> 00:39:46.512
...approximately...

540
00:39:47.263 --> 00:39:50.266
...two thirds of an inch
which would put the time of death...

541
00:39:50.433 --> 00:39:52.477

A northern stout, to be exact.

560

WATSON: You know, Holmes,
I've seen things in war I don't understand.

561
00:41:06.008 --> 00:41:08.302
I once met a man
who predicted his own death...

562
00:41:08.469 --> 00:41:10.805
...right down to the number
and the placement...

563
00:41:10.972 --> 00:41:13.224
...of the bullets that killed him.

564
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:14.976
You have to admit, Holmes...

565
00:41:15.143 --> 00:41:17.770
...that a supernatural explanation
to this case...

566
00:41:17.937 --> 00:41:20.064
...is theoretically possible.

567
00:41:20.231 --> 00:41:25.236
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake
to theorize before one has data.

568
00:41:25.403 --> 00:41:28.156
Inevitably one begins to twist facts
to suit theories...

569
00:41:28.322 --> 00:41:30.533
...instead of theories to suit facts.

570
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.579
That said, I believe Adler's midget
is the key to this.

571

WATSON: Hm.

572
00:41:36.247 --> 00:41:39.417
HOLMES: Right. Scratches around
the keyhole where the watch was wound.

573
00:41:39.584 --> 00:41:42.211
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.

574
00:41:42.378 --> 00:41:45.756
Every time he wound the watch
his hand would slip, hence the scratches.

575
00:41:45.923 --> 00:41:46.966
Very good, Watson.

576
00:41:47.133 --> 00:41:50.845
You've developed considerable
deductive powers of your own. Hm.

- Maddison and Haig.

581
00:42:06.444 --> 00:42:08.779
They should be able to
give us an address.

582
00:42:12.783 --> 00:42:14.493
What a coincidence.

583
00:42:15.453 --> 00:42:18.122
There's one thing you've
failed to deduce from the watch.

584
00:42:18.289 --> 00:42:19.707
HOLMES: Really? I think not.

...and, oh, china figurines...

599
00:43:04.502 --> 00:43:06.462

- What of the warts?
- She's covered in warts.

I've got my address for the ginger midget.

- Should be just there.

Why I ever believed...

694
00:55:35.752 --> 00:55:39.423
...that I would get to have tea
with Mary's parents is beyond me...

695
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:43.802
- ...having been talked into going with you.
- We were set upon. It was self-defense.

696
00:55:43.969 --> 00:55:48.223
I've been reviewing my notes
on our exploits over the last seven months.

697

Would you like to know my conclusion?

698
00:55:50.767 --> 00:55:53.687
- I am psychologically disturbed.
- How so?

699
00:55:53.854 --> 00:55:58.025
Why else would I continually be
led into situations...

700
00:55:58.191 --> 00:56:02.779
...where you deliberately withhold
your plans from me? Why else?

701
00:56:03.613 --> 00:56:06.950
You've never complained
about my methods before.

702
00:56:07.117 --> 00:56:09.411
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?

703
00:56:09.578 --> 00:56:11.455
How am I complaining? I never complain.

704
00:56:11.621 --> 00:56:14.540
Do I complain about you practicing
the violin in the morning...

705
00:56:14.708 --> 00:56:18.920
...or your mess, your lack of hygiene,
or the fact that you steal my clothes?

706
00:56:19.087 --> 00:56:20.297
We have a barter system.

707

about you setting fire to my rooms?

- Our rooms.
- The rooms.

709
00:56:24.176 --> 00:56:26.803
When do I complain
that you experiment on my dog?

710
00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:28.138
- Our dog.
- On the dog.

711
00:56:28.305 --> 00:56:29.765
Gladstone is our dog.

712
00:56:29.931 --> 00:56:34.978
Where I do take issue is your campaign
to sabotage my relationship with Mary.

713
00:56:42.652 --> 00:56:44.029
I understand.

714
00:56:44.196 --> 00:56:45.906
- Do you?
- I do.

715
00:56:47.115 --> 00:56:49.534
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.

716
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.661
- Yes.
- You're feeling sensitive.

717
00:56:51.828 --> 00:56:52.996
I'm not sensitive.

718
00:56:53.163 --> 00:56:55.373
What you need is a rest.

has a small estate near Chichester.

We can throw a lamb on the spit.

it would be with my future wife.

722
00:57:06.927 --> 00:57:10.013

- No, not you. Mary and I.

723

- You are not...
- What, invited?

724
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.768
Why would I not be invited
to my brother's country home?

725
00:57:14.935 --> 00:57:16.478
Now you're not making any sense.

apologies for summoning you like this.

I'm sure it's quite a mystery
as to where you are and who I am.

As to where I am...

<i>...I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.</i>

But our secret systems have steered
the world towards good for centuries.

you don't believe in magic, Mr. Holmes.

We don't expect you to share our faith...

...with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...

...together with identical outer ears, which
are only passed down through bloodline...

...or, in this case, more likely,
father and son.

Very few people
are privy to that information...

...and we want to keep it that way.

during one of our rituals.

...but she shared our beliefs.

801
01:01:40.951 --> 01:01:43.120
She was a powerful practitioner...

802
01:01:43.287 --> 01:01:45.956
...though not enough
to survive giving birth to him.

803
01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:49.960

to be butchered.

of course, but we all knew.

The boy was a curse.

...is that I can pick and choose
my clients.

01:02:45.015 --> 01:02:46.851
So consider it done, I'll stop him.

824
01:02:50.479 --> 01:02:52.440

- What is that?

- What...?

come away with me?

Never.

- No latitude for misunderstanding.
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.

877
01:08:03.876 --> 01:08:06.879
Indeed. And chambermaids
were once such a liberal breed.

My wife's a chambermaid, sir.

- Out of common decency.
- Crime is common, logic is rare.

killer, not provide comfort for the corpse.

Now that you're sitting
comfortably, I shall begin.

1137
01:32:20.539 --> 01:32:23.584
My initial approach was far too narrow.

1138
01:32:23.751 --> 01:32:26.212
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville Prison...

1139
01:32:26.378 --> 01:32:29.798
...he suggested I widen my gaze
and, at minimum, I have done just that.

1140
01:32:29.965 --> 01:32:34.970
In fact, I may well have reconciled
thousands of years of theological disparity.

1141
01:32:36.305 --> 01:32:38.641
But that's for another time.

1142
01:32:38.807 --> 01:32:41.977
Blackwood's method is based on
a ritualistic mystical system...

1143
01:32:42.144 --> 01:32:45.439
...that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.

1144
01:32:45.606 --> 01:32:48.692
To fully understand the system,
to get inside it...

1145
01:32:48.859 --> 01:32:52.404
...I reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt...

1146
01:32:52.571 --> 01:32:54.490
...with a few enhancements of my own.

1147
01:32:55.449 --> 01:32:59.495
My journey took me somewhat further down
the rabbit hole than I had intended...

1148
01:32:59.662 --> 01:33:04.166
...and though I dirtied my fluffy
white tail, I have emerged enlightened.

1149
01:33:05.459 --> 01:33:08.003
The fraternity who silently control
the empire...

1150
01:33:08.170 --> 01:33:11.340
...share the belief with the kings,
pharaohs and emperors of old...

1151
01:33:11.507 --> 01:33:14.301
...that the sphinx was a door
to another dimension...

1152
01:33:14.468 --> 01:33:16.553
...a gateway to immeasurable power.

1153
01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:20.474
It's made up of four parts:
the foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...

1154
01:33:20.641 --> 01:33:23.018
...the wings of an eagle,
and the head of a man.

1155
01:33:23.811 --> 01:33:26.730
<i>In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...</i>

1156
01:33:26.897 --> 01:33:29.984
<i>...the tooth of a lion, the feather
of an eagle and hair of a man.</i>

1158
01:33:35.364 --> 01:33:38.200
The points of the star
represent the five murdered girls...

1159
01:33:38.367 --> 01:33:41.328
...but the cross
is what we're now interested in.

1160
01:33:41.578 --> 01:33:42.871
It's a widely held belief...

1161
01:33:43.038 --> 01:33:46.417
...that within the architecture
of the great cities...

1162
01:33:46.583 --> 01:33:49.336
...are coded references to this system.

1163
01:33:49.503 --> 01:33:52.506
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood has killed three men...

1164
01:33:52.673 --> 01:33:56.176
...each committed at a location
that has a connection with the temple...

1165
01:33:56.343 --> 01:33:57.720
...therefore the system.

1166
01:33:59.513 --> 01:34:01.724
<i>Reordan, the ginger midget,
represents man.</i>

1167
01:34:01.890 --> 01:34:03.892
We found his body here.

1168
01:34:04.518 --> 01:34:07.730
{\an8}Sir Thomas, master of the temple,
wore the ox ring.

1169
01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:10.232
He died here.

1170
01:34:11.066 --> 01:34:12.693
{\an8}Standish, ambassador to America...

1171
01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:15.988
{\an8}...where the eagle has been
the national emblem for over 100 years.

1172
01:34:16.155 --> 01:34:20.242
The headquarters of the Temple
of the Four Orders where he died...

1173
01:34:20.409 --> 01:34:22.661
...is here.

1174
01:34:23.329 --> 01:34:26.665
Correspondingly, the map will tell us
the location of Blackwood's final act.

1175
01:34:26.831 --> 01:34:29.668
So we have man, the ox, eagle.

1176
01:34:30.586 --> 01:34:31.754

1204
01:36:23.948 --> 01:36:25.534
My Lord.

1205
01:36:31.373 --> 01:36:34.501
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...

1206
01:36:34.710 --> 01:36:36.670
...or just the one I prevented?

1207
01:36:37.838 --> 01:36:40.299
Very distinctive,
those handmade shoes of yours.

1208
01:36:42.718 --> 01:36:47.598
But the price of quality
is often the unique imprint they leave.

1209
01:36:48.557 --> 01:36:51.727
Nonetheless, I confess to being
completely outmatched.

1210
01:36:52.478 --> 01:36:55.189
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1211
01:36:56.565 --> 01:36:58.734
Fortunately,
there's nothing more stimulating...

1212
01:36:58.901 --> 01:37:01.236
...than a case where everything
goes against you.

1213
01:37:01.904 --> 01:37:05.407
How many members of Parliament
do you intend to murder at noon today?

1214
01:37:05.574 --> 01:37:07.201
Man, ox, eagle, lion.

1215
01:37:08.076 --> 01:37:09.661
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?

1216
01:37:12.748 --> 01:37:14.458
Very clever.

1217
01:37:14.875 --> 01:37:17.419
But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes.

1218
01:37:17.586 --> 01:37:19.254
It's mercy.

1219
01:37:19.421 --> 01:37:21.924
We are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd.

1220
01:37:22.090 --> 01:37:24.551
Don't you see that it's for their own...?

1221
01:37:27.346 --> 01:37:30.057
HOLMES: No, but I don't care
much what you think.

1222
01:37:30.224 --> 01:37:33.101
I simply wanted to know the location
of Blackwood's ceremony...

1223
01:37:33.268 --> 01:37:34.686
...and you've given it to me.

1224
01:37:34.853 --> 01:37:36.063
I've told you nothing.

1225
01:37:36.647 --> 01:37:39.942
HOLMES: But your clothes say
infinitely more than you could ever hope.

1226
01:37:40.108 --> 01:37:42.861
<i>The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.</i>

1227
01:37:43.445 --> 01:37:46.782
<i>A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.</i>

1228
01:37:48.075 --> 01:37:51.286
<i>A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.</i>

1229
01:37:51.453 --> 01:37:55.457
<i>A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.</i>

1230
01:37:57.709 --> 01:38:00.462
You and Blackwood laid the final touches
to your ceremony...

1231
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:03.715
...in the sewers beneath Parliament
less than an hour ago.

1232
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.802
Both houses meet today.

1233
01:38:07.386 --> 01:38:09.388
The whole government will be present.

1234
01:38:18.772 --> 01:38:22.066
COWARD: It's a shame you made an enemy
out of Blackwood, Holmes.

1235
01:38:22.776 --> 01:38:24.570
You would have made a valuable ally.

1236
01:38:31.994 --> 01:38:33.912
How terrible is wisdom...

1237
01:38:34.078 --> 01:38:36.957
...when it brings no profit to the wise.

1238
01:38:37.666 --> 01:38:39.167
We take power at noon.

1239
01:38:40.168 --> 01:38:42.504
There isn't any time to waste then,
is there?

1240
01:39:09.364 --> 01:39:11.617
TANNER: I told you he'd be coming
out the top window.

1241
01:39:11.783 --> 01:39:14.286
There isn't any way
he'd be coming over that terrace.

1242
01:39:14.453 --> 01:39:17.289
Technically, that isn't the top window,
is it, sailor boy?

1243
01:39:17.456 --> 01:39:19.958
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.

1244
01:39:20.124 --> 01:39:21.293
Anyway.

1245
01:39:22.377 --> 01:39:24.963
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.

1246
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:26.798
In fact, I think he enjoyed it.

1247
01:39:26.965 --> 01:39:28.675
I hope you know what you're doing.

1248
01:39:29.384 --> 01:39:31.053
Here's the key.

1249
01:39:31.219 --> 01:39:35.057
- You got all you needed from Coward?
- Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease.

1250

- Tanner?
- Sir?

1251

If you would, captain...

1252
01:39:39.061 --> 01:39:41.897
...take us under the bridge,
port side, 100 yards.

1253
01:39:42.064 --> 01:39:45.400
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel
that leads us to the sewers.

1254
01:39:45.567 --> 01:39:46.985
Right away, sir.

01:40:53.719 --> 01:40:55.679

1374
01:51:57.131 --> 01:52:00.218
...until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

1375
01:52:01.552 --> 01:52:03.971
<i>An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...</i>

1376

...yet it burned
with an unusual pinkish hue.

1377
01:52:08.810 --> 01:52:12.146
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

1378
01:52:13.314 --> 01:52:14.774
All it took was a spark.

1379
01:52:19.237 --> 01:52:21.447
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.

1380
01:52:22.906 --> 01:52:24.325

and refined in the bellies of swine.</i>

Had it worked...

1384
01:52:34.794 --> 01:52:37.672
...your followers in Parliament
would have watched unharmed...

1385
01:52:37.839 --> 01:52:40.341
...as their colleagues
were dying around them.

1386
01:52:40.508 --> 01:52:42.510
They didn't know
you'd given them the antidote.

1387

<i>Instead, they would've
believed it was magic...</i>

1388

<i>...and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.</i>

Oh. Good afternoon.

I was trying to deduce the manner
in which Blackwood survived his execution.

Carry on.

1452
01:57:35.177 --> 01:57:37.847
Well, the executioner
attached it to a harness...

Yes.
