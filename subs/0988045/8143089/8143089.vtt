1
00:01:40.187 --> 00:01:41.646
<i>Head cocked to the left...</i>

2
00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:43.606
<i>...partial deafness in ear.</i>

3
00:01:43.774 --> 00:01:45.024
<i>First point of attack.</i>

4
00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:49.821
<i>Two, throat. Paralyze vocal cords.
Stop screaming.</i>

5
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.992
<i>Three, got to be heavy drinker.
Floating rib to the liver.</i>

6
00:01:54.618 --> 00:01:57.537
<i>Four, finally, dragging left leg.
Fist to patella.</i>

7
00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.207
<i>Summary of prognosis,
conscious in 90 seconds.</i>

8
00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:03.084
<i>Martial efficacy, quarter of an hour.</i>

9
00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:05.837
<i>Full faculty recovery, unlikely.</i>

10
00:03:18.952 --> 00:03:20.411
I like the hat.

11
00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.080
I just picked it up.

12
00:03:22.247 --> 00:03:23.998
Did you remember your revolver?

13
00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:25.416
Knew I forgot something.

14
00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:28.795
- Thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.

15
00:03:31.215 --> 00:03:33.257
I think that's quite enough.

16
00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:35.259
You are a doctor, after all.

17
00:03:40.891 --> 00:03:42.975
Always nice to see you, Watson.

18
00:03:45.396 --> 00:03:47.355
Where's the inspector?

19
00:03:47.564 --> 00:03:49.774
He's getting his troops lined up.

20
00:03:49.942 --> 00:03:51.275
That could be all day.

21
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:51.127
Sherlock Holmes.

22
00:04:52.963 --> 00:04:54.630
And his loyal dog.

23
00:04:55.215 --> 00:04:56.549
Tell me, doctor...

24
00:04:56.717 --> 00:04:59.552
...as a medical man,
have you enjoyed my work?

25
00:05:00.053 --> 00:05:02.305
Let me show you
how much I've enjoyed it.

26
00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:04.640
Watson. Don't.

27
00:05:08.812 --> 00:05:10.521
Observe.

28
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.276
How did you see that?

29
00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:16.819
Because I was looking for it.

30
00:05:21.825 --> 00:05:23.743
Lord Blackwood.

31
00:05:24.828 --> 00:05:26.078
You seem surprised.

32
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.749
I'd say the girl deserves your attention
more than he.

33
00:05:30.918 --> 00:05:32.710
Indeed.

34
00:05:37.883 --> 00:05:40.593
Oh, I'd leave that alone
if I were you, boy-o.

35
00:05:41.094 --> 00:05:42.762
Good lad.

36
00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:45.181
Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

37
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.934
We've one for the doctor...

38
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:49.602
...and one for the rope.

39
00:05:50.103 --> 00:05:51.562
- Clarkie?
- Sir?

40
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.606
This woman needs a hospital
immediately.

41
00:05:53.774 --> 00:05:55.399
Put her in the back of the Moriah.

42
00:05:55.567 --> 00:05:57.026
Right, lads. That's it.

43
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.907
- Right. Pick him up, lads.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:06:03.075 --> 00:06:04.992
If you don't mind.

45
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.912
Get him out of my sight.

46
00:06:13.543 --> 00:06:15.628
And you were supposed to
wait for my orders.

47
00:06:16.964 --> 00:06:21.050
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse
and chasing a rumor.

48
00:06:21.218 --> 00:06:24.136
Besides, the girl's parents hired me,
not the Yard.

49
00:06:24.304 --> 00:06:27.139
Why they thought you'd require
any assistance is beyond me.

50
00:06:27.307 --> 00:06:29.976
Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.

51
00:06:30.143 --> 00:06:32.311
Indeed. Congratulations, Lestrade.

52
00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.147
Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar.

53
00:06:35.315 --> 00:06:36.649
Gentlemen.

54
00:06:36.817 --> 00:06:38.025
Cheese.

55
00:07:06.972 --> 00:07:09.849
Blackwood hangs tomorrow.
Read all about it.

56
00:07:13.937 --> 00:07:17.857
156 over 80. Very good.

57
00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:21.485
My nerves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.

58
00:07:21.653 --> 00:07:23.070
Tell me something.

59
00:07:23.238 --> 00:07:25.239
Your new premises...

60
00:07:25.407 --> 00:07:26.657
...when are you moving in?

61
00:07:26.825 --> 00:07:28.659
I should be in within the week.

62
00:07:28.827 --> 00:07:32.204
Cavendish Place.
And there'll be a woman's touch too.

63
00:07:32.372 --> 00:07:33.789
- Well, that's marvelous.
- Indeed.

64
00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:37.418
Good God.

65
00:07:38.503 --> 00:07:40.504
- That was gunfire.
- No.

66
00:07:40.672 --> 00:07:43.758
No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?

67
00:07:43.925 --> 00:07:47.178
My colleague's probably
just putting up a painting.

68
00:07:47.346 --> 00:07:49.555
I'll... I'll go and check.

69
00:07:49.723 --> 00:07:51.682
- Your colleague...
- Yes?

70
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.226
Won't be moving with you, will he?

71
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:56.520
No, he won't.

72
00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:00.274
Mrs. Hudson.

73
00:08:00.442 --> 00:08:03.027
I won't go in,
not while he's got a gun in his hand.

74
00:08:03.195 --> 00:08:04.904
You don't have to. Give me the paper.

75
00:08:05.072 --> 00:08:08.657
What'll I do when you leave, doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.

76
00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:10.701
He just needs another case. That's all.

77
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:12.953
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?

78
00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:16.540
I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you
know, not in a domestic environment.

79
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:21.212
Thank you, Captain Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?

80
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.007
- Same time next week.
- Come along, captain.

81
00:08:25.175 --> 00:08:27.426
- It's quieter downstairs.
- Mrs. Hudson?

82
00:08:27.594 --> 00:08:29.095
Bring something to cheer him up.

83
00:08:39.147 --> 00:08:41.565
Permission to enter the armory?

84
00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:42.775
Granted.

85
00:08:45.195 --> 00:08:48.697
Watson, I am in the process
of inventing a device...

86
00:08:48.865 --> 00:08:50.866
...that suppresses the sound
of a gunshot.

87
00:08:54.287 --> 00:08:56.205
It's not working.

88
00:08:56.373 --> 00:08:57.998
Can I see that?

89
00:09:05.966 --> 00:09:08.300
You know, it's been three months...

90
00:09:08.468 --> 00:09:10.761
...since your last case.

91
00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:15.806
Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me...

92
00:09:18.812 --> 00:09:21.397
Don't you think it's time
you found another one?

93
00:09:23.442 --> 00:09:24.817
I can't but agree.

94
00:09:24.985 --> 00:09:28.571
My mind rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems. Give me work.

95
00:09:28.738 --> 00:09:30.364
The sooner, the better.

96
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:32.283
Paper.

97
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.162
Let's see, then. There's a letter here...

98
00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:39.623
...from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.

99
00:09:39.791 --> 00:09:43.335
- Her husband's disappeared.
- He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.

100
00:09:43.503 --> 00:09:45.129
Is it November?

101
00:09:45.714 --> 00:09:47.923
Yes, Holmes. All right.

102
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:50.885
Lady Radford reports...

103
00:09:51.052 --> 00:09:53.262
Oh, her emerald bracelet
has disappeared.

104
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.725
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford
likes fast women and slow ponies.

105
00:09:57.893 --> 00:10:01.604
I see you're the attending physician
at Blackwood's hanging.

106
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:02.813
Yes.

107
00:10:02.981 --> 00:10:06.567
It was our last case together
and I wanted to see it through to the end.

108
00:10:13.241 --> 00:10:14.909
A Mr. Lewis is seeking...

109
00:10:15.076 --> 00:10:17.786
There's only one case
that intrigues me at present:

110
00:10:17.954 --> 00:10:22.041
The curious case of Mrs. Hudson,
the absentee landlady.

111
00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:24.251
I've been studying
her comings and goings.

112
00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:26.545
They appear most sinister.

113
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.380
Tea, Mr. Holmes?

114
00:10:28.548 --> 00:10:29.840
Is it poisoned, nanny?

115
00:10:30.425 --> 00:10:32.343
There's enough of that in you already.

116
00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:35.054
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place...

117
00:10:35.222 --> 00:10:37.556
...as per usual, nanny.

118
00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:40.893
He's killed the dog. Again.

119
00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:43.437
What have you done to Gladstone now?

120
00:10:43.605 --> 00:10:46.732
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.

121
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.567
He doesn't mind.

122
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.821
Holmes, as your doctor...

123
00:10:52.989 --> 00:10:57.201
- He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.
- As your friend...

124
00:10:57.369 --> 00:11:01.413
...you've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.

125
00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:05.668
There's nothing of interest for me
out there, on earth, at all.

126
00:11:07.587 --> 00:11:09.421
- You're free this evening?
- Absolutely.

127
00:11:09.589 --> 00:11:11.840
- Dinner? The Royale?
- Wonderful. My favorite.

128
00:11:12.259 --> 00:11:13.551
Mary's coming.

129
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.638
- Not available.
- You're meeting her, Holmes.

130
00:11:19.349 --> 00:11:20.683
Have you proposed yet?

131
00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:24.895
- No, I haven't found the right ring.
- Then it's not official.

132
00:11:25.063 --> 00:11:27.189
It's happening, whether you like it or not.

133
00:11:27.357 --> 00:11:29.441
8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket.

134
00:11:29.609 --> 00:11:31.151
You wear a jacket.

135
00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:47.543
A man? Outside my house?

136
00:11:54.134 --> 00:11:56.051
Straighten your tie.

137
00:12:06.688 --> 00:12:08.814
Holmes.

138
00:12:09.608 --> 00:12:10.941
You're early.

139
00:12:12.277 --> 00:12:13.819
Fashionably.

140
00:12:13.987 --> 00:12:15.988
Miss Mary Morstan.

141
00:12:16.156 --> 00:12:18.490
My goodness. What a pleasure.

142
00:12:18.908 --> 00:12:22.286
I don't know why it's taken him so long
to introduce us properly.

143
00:12:22.454 --> 00:12:23.829
Pleasure is mine.

144
00:12:28.752 --> 00:12:32.087
It really is quite a thrill to meet you,
Mr. Holmes.

145
00:12:32.255 --> 00:12:34.214
I've heard so much about you.

146
00:12:34.591 --> 00:12:36.717
I have a pile of detective novels at home.

147
00:12:36.885 --> 00:12:39.094
- Wilkie Collins, Poe.
- It's true.

148
00:12:39.262 --> 00:12:41.764
It can seem a little far-fetched
though sometimes...

149
00:12:42.182 --> 00:12:44.683
...making grand assumptions
out of tiny details.

150
00:12:44.851 --> 00:12:46.644
That's not quite right, is it?

151
00:12:46.895 --> 00:12:49.772
In fact, the little details
are by far the most important.

152
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.653
- Take Watson.
- I intend to.

153
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.241
See his walking stick?
A rare African snakewood...

154
00:13:01.409 --> 00:13:03.869
...hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.

155
00:13:05.163 --> 00:13:07.498
A few were awarded
to veterans of the Afghan war...

156
00:13:07.666 --> 00:13:09.708
...so I can assume
he's a decorated soldier.

157
00:13:09.876 --> 00:13:12.878
Strong, brave,
born to be a man of action.

158
00:13:13.046 --> 00:13:15.714
And neat, like all military men.

159
00:13:15.882 --> 00:13:18.842
Now, I check his pockets.

160
00:13:19.678 --> 00:13:24.390
A stub from a boxing match. Now I
can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.

161
00:13:24.557 --> 00:13:26.225
I'd keep an eye on that dowry.

162
00:13:26.393 --> 00:13:28.727
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.

163
00:13:28.895 --> 00:13:30.729
He's cost us the rent more than once.

164
00:13:31.147 --> 00:13:34.566
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
you know John very well.

165
00:13:34.734 --> 00:13:37.236
What about a complete stranger?

166
00:13:38.113 --> 00:13:40.155
- What can you tell about me?
- You?

167
00:13:40.323 --> 00:13:41.923
- I don't think...
- I don't know that...

168
00:13:42.075 --> 00:13:43.344
- Not at dinner.
- Some other time.

169
00:13:43.368 --> 00:13:44.493
- I insist.
- You insist?

170
00:13:44.661 --> 00:13:47.746
- You remember we discussed this.
- The lady insists.

171
00:13:54.129 --> 00:13:55.629
- You're a governess.
- Well done.

172
00:13:55.797 --> 00:13:57.423
Yes, well done. Shall we...?

173
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.883
- Waiter?
- Your student...

174
00:14:00.051 --> 00:14:01.385
...is a boy of 8.

175
00:14:01.553 --> 00:14:04.430
- Charlie's 7, actually.
- Charlie, huh?

176
00:14:04.597 --> 00:14:07.433
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.

177
00:14:07.976 --> 00:14:09.184
Is there ink on my face?

178
00:14:09.352 --> 00:14:11.270
There's nothing wrong with your face.

179
00:14:11.438 --> 00:14:13.397
There are two drops on your ear, in fact.

180
00:14:13.565 --> 00:14:15.733
India blue's nearly impossible
to wash off.

181
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.526
A very impetuous act by the boy.

182
00:14:17.694 --> 00:14:19.820
But you're too experienced
to react rashly...

183
00:14:19.988 --> 00:14:22.781
...which is why the lady for whom you work
lent you that.

184
00:14:23.199 --> 00:14:27.453
Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby.
Hardly the gems of a governess.

185
00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:33.459
The jewels you are not wearing
tell us more.

186
00:14:33.626 --> 00:14:35.961
- Holmes.
- You were engaged.

187
00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:38.589
The ring is gone,
but the lighter skin suggests...

188
00:14:38.757 --> 00:14:41.467
...that you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly...

189
00:14:41.634 --> 00:14:44.136
...until you were informed
of its true, modest worth.

190
00:14:44.304 --> 00:14:45.971
You broke off the engagement...

191
00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:48.974
...and returned to England
for better prospects.

192
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:51.769
A doctor, perhaps.

193
00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.402
Right on all counts, Mr. Holmes,
apart from one.

194
00:15:03.364 --> 00:15:05.324
I didn't leave him.

195
00:15:05.658 --> 00:15:07.159
He died.

196
00:15:17.045 --> 00:15:18.670
Well done, old boy.

197
00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:57.292
- Fight. Fight.
- Get him.

198
00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:34.413
Get up and fight.

199
00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:38.709
Fight.

200
00:16:38.876 --> 00:16:40.377
- Finish it.
- Come on.

201
00:16:46.426 --> 00:16:48.552
Get up and fight, come on.

202
00:16:49.137 --> 00:16:50.762
Come on.

203
00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:53.348
Get up.

204
00:16:55.643 --> 00:16:57.686
Get up and fight.

205
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:06.403
That's it, big man, we're done.

206
00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:08.488
You won, congratulations.

207
00:17:09.324 --> 00:17:10.574
We ain't done yet.

208
00:17:15.955 --> 00:17:18.624
<i>This mustn't register
on an emotional level.</i>

209
00:17:19.792 --> 00:17:21.460
<i>First, distract target.</i>

210
00:17:22.712 --> 00:17:24.421
<i>Then block his blind jab.</i>

211
00:17:24.964 --> 00:17:27.466
<i>Counter with cross to left cheek.</i>

212
00:17:28.926 --> 00:17:30.802
<i>Discombobulate.</i>

213
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.846
<i>Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.</i>

214
00:17:33.014 --> 00:17:36.141
<i>Employ elbow block, and body shot.</i>

215
00:17:37.435 --> 00:17:39.645
<i>Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.</i>

216
00:17:41.648 --> 00:17:43.273
<i>Now fracture.</i>

217
00:17:44.942 --> 00:17:46.652
<i>Break cracked ribs.</i>

218
00:17:47.111 --> 00:17:48.487
<i>Traumatize solar plexus.</i>

219
00:17:49.072 --> 00:17:50.447
<i>Dislocate jaw entirely.</i>

220
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.661
<i>Heel kick to diaphragm.</i>

221
00:17:57.705 --> 00:18:02.125
<i>In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured,
three ribs cracked, four broken...</i>

222
00:18:02.293 --> 00:18:05.087
<i>...diaphragm hemorrhaging,
physical recovery, six weeks...</i>

223
00:18:05.755 --> 00:18:08.090
<i>...full psychological recovery,
six months...</i>

224
00:18:08.257 --> 00:18:09.841
<i>...capacity to spit at back of head...</i>

225
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.219
<i>...neutralized.</i>

226
00:18:40.081 --> 00:18:42.249
Where did that come from?

227
00:19:21.414 --> 00:19:23.582
What the hell's going on here, Charlie?

228
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.293
Lord Blackwood's put him
under some kind of spell, sir.

229
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:29.213
It's like he's burning from the inside out.

230
00:19:31.883 --> 00:19:34.593
You lot, shut up!

231
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.595
Charlie. Charlie!

232
00:19:37.097 --> 00:19:38.889
Take this man to the infirmary, now.

233
00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:53.779
What's this all about, then, Blackwood?

234
00:19:58.118 --> 00:20:00.119
There's someone I want to see.

235
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.808
- Watson?
- Right.

236
00:20:22.976 --> 00:20:24.643
Let's go.

237
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.229
What started merely as an experiment...

238
00:20:27.397 --> 00:20:30.316
...has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery.

239
00:20:30.608 --> 00:20:33.444
Now, if I play a chromatic scale...

240
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.904
...there's no measurable response.

241
00:20:36.072 --> 00:20:38.824
You do know what you're drinking
is meant for eye surgery?

242
00:20:38.992 --> 00:20:40.326
But, now...

243
00:20:40.493 --> 00:20:41.827
...and this is remarkable...

244
00:20:41.995 --> 00:20:45.622
...if I change to atonal clusters...

245
00:20:46.666 --> 00:20:51.128
...voilá, they fly in counterclockwise,
synchronized concentric circles...

246
00:20:51.296 --> 00:20:52.880
...as though a regimented flock.

247
00:20:53.048 --> 00:20:54.673
Watson, this is exceptional.

248
00:20:54.841 --> 00:20:59.636
I, using musical theory,
have created order out of chaos.

249
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:02.431
How did you lure them in?

250
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:04.308
Excellent question.

251
00:21:04.476 --> 00:21:07.353
Individually. I've
been at it for six hours.

252
00:21:08.104 --> 00:21:10.189
- And what happens if I do this?
- What?

253
00:21:13.485 --> 00:21:14.860
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.

254
00:21:15.528 --> 00:21:17.488
You are Blackwood's last request.

255
00:21:29.876 --> 00:21:31.960
Look at those towering structures.

256
00:21:32.712 --> 00:21:36.423
It's the first combination of bascule
and suspension bridge ever attempted.

257
00:21:36.591 --> 00:21:38.509
Most innovative.

258
00:21:41.304 --> 00:21:42.888
What an industrious empire.

259
00:21:45.016 --> 00:21:47.559
Oh, I have your winnings from last night.

260
00:21:48.937 --> 00:21:51.772
You weren't there,
so I made your customary bet.

261
00:21:53.566 --> 00:21:57.653
Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook,
locked safely away in my drawer.

262
00:21:59.739 --> 00:22:02.491
Did you know the opera house
is featuring <i>Don Giovanni?</i>

263
00:22:02.659 --> 00:22:07.246
I could procure a couple of tickets if you
had any cultural inclinations this evening.

264
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.751
You have the grand gift of silence,
Watson.

265
00:22:12.919 --> 00:22:15.546
It makes you quite invaluable
as a companion.

266
00:22:17.924 --> 00:22:20.300
I knew she'd been engaged.

267
00:22:20.468 --> 00:22:21.593
She had told me.

268
00:22:21.761 --> 00:22:23.429
So that's no to the opera, then?

269
00:22:30.145 --> 00:22:33.230
- That was my waistcoat.
- We agreed it's too small for you.

270
00:22:33.398 --> 00:22:34.898
- I'd like it back.
- We agreed.

271
00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:36.567
I want it back.

272
00:23:09.476 --> 00:23:11.477
This way, Mr. Holmes.

273
00:23:12.812 --> 00:23:16.607
Blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.

274
00:23:16.816 --> 00:23:20.235
Which I'm certain will disperse
once his feet have stopped twitching.

275
00:23:20.403 --> 00:23:21.904
Care to come along?

276
00:23:22.071 --> 00:23:25.365
No, old cock. I've no business
with him whilst he's alive.

277
00:23:25.533 --> 00:23:27.826
Suit yourself, mother hen.

278
00:23:39.672 --> 00:23:42.925
It seems you have lots of rooms to let.

279
00:23:43.092 --> 00:23:46.887
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we were gonna have a riot.

280
00:23:47.055 --> 00:23:50.349
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.

281
00:23:50.517 --> 00:23:52.100
As though...

282
00:23:53.186 --> 00:23:55.604
...he can get inside their heads.

283
00:23:58.691 --> 00:24:01.610
I can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform.

284
00:24:01.778 --> 00:24:04.530
Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir.

285
00:24:05.365 --> 00:24:09.201
If any man have an ear, let him hear.

286
00:24:09.369 --> 00:24:12.246
I stood upon the sand of the sea
and saw a beast rise up...

287
00:24:12.413 --> 00:24:14.164
...having seven heads and 10 horns.

288
00:24:14.332 --> 00:24:16.625
Upon his heads were
the name of blasphemy.

289
00:24:16.793 --> 00:24:19.044
They worshiped the dragon,
which gave power.

290
00:24:19.212 --> 00:24:21.797
They worshiped, saying,
"Who is like unto the beast?"

291
00:24:21.965 --> 00:24:23.840
The beast which I saw
was like a leopard.

292
00:24:24.008 --> 00:24:26.677
His feet were of a bear,
his mouth was of a lion...

293
00:24:26.844 --> 00:24:30.472
...and the dragon gave him his power
and his seat and great authority.

294
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.933
I love what you've done with the place.

295
00:24:34.602 --> 00:24:36.895
So glad you could accept my invitation.

296
00:24:37.522 --> 00:24:40.107
I just have a small point of concern.

297
00:24:40.942 --> 00:24:43.694
- How can I help?
- I'd followed the murders with interest.

298
00:24:43.903 --> 00:24:46.697
While my heart went out
to the families of the victims...

299
00:24:46.864 --> 00:24:50.826
...I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery
in the stroke of your brush.

300
00:24:51.077 --> 00:24:53.412
- You're too kind.
- However, by comparison...

301
00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.416
...your work in the crypt
was more akin to a finger painting.

302
00:25:00.753 --> 00:25:04.131
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a larger game afoot.

303
00:25:04.299 --> 00:25:06.967
Either that or,

304
00:25:07.135 --> 00:25:11.013
shortly my friend will pronounce you dead
and I thought I might keep him company.

305
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.600
Your mistake is to imagine that
anything earthly's led to this moment.

306
00:25:14.767 --> 00:25:18.770
Your error of judgment is to assume
that I'm holding the brush at all.

307
00:25:18.938 --> 00:25:22.482
- I'm merely the channel.
- My only wish is that I caught you sooner.

308
00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.444
You see,
five lives might have been spared.

309
00:25:25.612 --> 00:25:28.614
Those lives were a necessity.

310
00:25:30.283 --> 00:25:31.950
Sacrifice.

311
00:25:32.452 --> 00:25:35.412
Five meaningless creatures
called to serve a greater purpose.

312
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.998
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me
dissect your brain.

313
00:25:38.166 --> 00:25:39.916
After you're hanged, of course.

314
00:25:41.461 --> 00:25:44.921
I'd wager there's some deformity
that'd be scientifically significant.

315
00:25:45.089 --> 00:25:48.717
Then you, too,
could serve a greater purpose.

316
00:25:49.302 --> 00:25:52.971
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.

317
00:25:53.139 --> 00:25:57.976
I'm concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

318
00:25:58.645 --> 00:26:00.812
You and I are bound together
on a journey...

319
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.565
...that will twist the
very fabric of nature.

320
00:26:04.108 --> 00:26:08.195
But beneath your mask of logic,
I sense a fragility.

321
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:10.447
That worries me.

322
00:26:11.282 --> 00:26:13.950
Steel your mind, Holmes.

323
00:26:14.577 --> 00:26:15.619
I need you.

324
00:26:15.787 --> 00:26:18.205
You've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

325
00:26:18.373 --> 00:26:19.956
- And I will rise again.
<i>- Bon voyage.</i>

326
00:26:20.124 --> 00:26:21.792
Pay attention.

327
00:26:21.959 --> 00:26:25.295
Three more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

328
00:26:25.463 --> 00:26:28.507
You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

329
00:26:28.675 --> 00:26:32.219
...or, by the time you realize you
made all of this possible...

330
00:26:32.387 --> 00:26:35.639
...it'll be the last sane thought
in your head.

331
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:44.731
What did he want?

332
00:26:44.899 --> 00:26:46.483
Not sure.

333
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:49.611
But I don't think you're needed, Father.
Not for this one.

334
00:26:51.406 --> 00:26:53.365
<i>Lord Henry Blackwood...</i>

335
00:26:53.533 --> 00:26:57.953
...you are sentenced to death
for the practice of black magic...

336
00:26:58.371 --> 00:27:01.456
...the unholy murder of five
innocent young women...

337
00:27:01.624 --> 00:27:04.042
...and the attempted murder of a sixth.

338
00:27:04.752 --> 00:27:06.712
Do you have any final words?

339
00:27:07.714 --> 00:27:09.339
Death...

340
00:27:10.383 --> 00:27:12.551
...is only the beginning.

341
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.814
...forever and ever. Amen.

342
00:27:47.086 --> 00:27:50.422
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

343
00:28:11.778 --> 00:28:14.780
London's so bleak this time of year.

344
00:28:15.615 --> 00:28:18.617
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

345
00:28:18.785 --> 00:28:21.286
I much prefer to travel in the winter.

346
00:28:23.623 --> 00:28:26.917
Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

347
00:28:27.084 --> 00:28:29.961
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...

348
00:28:30.129 --> 00:28:32.130
...and your favorite...

349
00:28:32.298 --> 00:28:34.674
...olives from the Cyclades.

350
00:28:34.842 --> 00:28:37.093
Thought we might have a little tea party.

351
00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:40.722
And while I was setting the table,
I found this:

352
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:42.974
A file with my name on it.

353
00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.144
"Theft of Velázquez portrait
from king of Spain."

354
00:28:47.146 --> 00:28:51.149
"Missing naval documents lead to
resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."

355
00:28:52.652 --> 00:28:56.321
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...

356
00:28:59.784 --> 00:29:01.910
...Hapsburg prince
to Romanov princess."

357
00:29:03.496 --> 00:29:05.997
I was simply studying your methods...

358
00:29:06.165 --> 00:29:08.192
...should the authorities
ask me to hunt you down.

359
00:29:10.002 --> 00:29:12.170
But I don't see my name
in any of these articles.

360
00:29:12.338 --> 00:29:14.130
But your signature was clear.

361
00:29:15.758 --> 00:29:17.759
Is that the maharajah's
missing diamond?

362
00:29:19.512 --> 00:29:21.137
Or just another souvenir?

363
00:29:21.764 --> 00:29:23.849
Let's not dwell on the past.

364
00:29:25.351 --> 00:29:27.060
Shall we?

365
00:29:29.272 --> 00:29:31.356
By the looks of things,
you're between jobs.

366
00:29:31.524 --> 00:29:34.776
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?

367
00:29:35.194 --> 00:29:38.864
He was boring and jealous,
and he snored.

368
00:29:41.868 --> 00:29:43.660
I'm Irene Adler again.

369
00:29:51.001 --> 00:29:52.502
Thank you.

370
00:29:58.634 --> 00:30:00.051
I need your help.

371
00:30:00.803 --> 00:30:03.012
I need you to find someone.

372
00:30:05.474 --> 00:30:07.058
Why are you always so suspicious?

373
00:30:07.226 --> 00:30:09.727
Shall I answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

374
00:30:09.895 --> 00:30:13.898
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

375
00:30:16.819 --> 00:30:19.862
I think you'll find all the information
you need inside.

376
00:30:21.156 --> 00:30:22.865
Who are you working for?

377
00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.244
So I'll have to find out the hard way?

378
00:30:27.413 --> 00:30:29.747
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.

379
00:30:29.915 --> 00:30:32.417
Well, consider it a wager that you will.

380
00:30:33.293 --> 00:30:35.545
Do you remember The Grand?

381
00:30:35.712 --> 00:30:37.922
They gave me our old room.

382
00:30:51.353 --> 00:30:52.687
Hold the door.

383
00:30:52.855 --> 00:30:54.730
Thanks, doctor.

384
00:31:17.296 --> 00:31:18.796
Ma'am.

385
00:31:22.468 --> 00:31:25.678
- He'll do it.
- Well done, Miss Adler.

386
00:31:26.597 --> 00:31:28.598
That's precisely why I hired you.

387
00:31:29.766 --> 00:31:32.351
I wager he'll have our man
within the next 24 hours.

388
00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:34.103
He'd better.

389
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:36.481
Reordan is the key
to what Blackwood was doing.

390
00:31:37.566 --> 00:31:39.317
He's essential to my plan.

391
00:31:39.485 --> 00:31:41.652
Get off out of it.

392
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.447
What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?

393
00:31:44.615 --> 00:31:46.616
- You scalp diver.
- Get off out of it.

394
00:31:47.659 --> 00:31:50.328
A little rifle range
would go a long way, sir...

395
00:31:50.496 --> 00:31:53.873
...rubbing the calluses
off these German bands.

396
00:31:54.625 --> 00:31:55.958
God save the queen.

397
00:31:57.127 --> 00:31:58.419
God save the queen, sir.

398
00:31:58.587 --> 00:31:59.921
Get off out of it.

399
00:32:04.051 --> 00:32:05.384
Look at you.

400
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:08.596
Why is the only woman
you've cared about a criminal?

401
00:32:08.764 --> 00:32:09.805
Are you a masochist?

402
00:32:09.973 --> 00:32:12.058
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.

403
00:32:12.226 --> 00:32:16.020
She's the only adversary
who ever outsmarted you. Twice.

404
00:32:16.188 --> 00:32:17.855
Made a proper idiot out of you.

405
00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:20.650
- Right, you've had your fun.
- What's she after, anyway?

406
00:32:20.817 --> 00:32:23.277
- It's time to press on.
- What could she possibly need?

407
00:32:23.445 --> 00:32:24.862
It doesn't matter.

408
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:28.157
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.

409
00:32:28.325 --> 00:32:31.160
She could sit on your back
and paddle you up the Thames.

410
00:32:31.328 --> 00:32:33.412
That's of no consequence to you, is it?

411
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.540
We've done our last case together.

412
00:32:35.707 --> 00:32:37.291
I've already read it.

413
00:32:38.168 --> 00:32:40.169
Missing person:

414
00:32:40.337 --> 00:32:43.339
Luke Reordan, 4 foot 10,
red hair, no front teeth.

415
00:32:43.507 --> 00:32:44.549
Case solved.

416
00:32:44.716 --> 00:32:48.010
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.

417
00:32:48.178 --> 00:32:49.804
- Midget.
- So you agree?

418
00:32:49.972 --> 00:32:51.222
No, I don't agree.

419
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.975
It's more than technicality, you see.

420
00:32:54.142 --> 00:32:57.228
You're misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples.

421
00:32:57.396 --> 00:33:00.898
- I've said too much. I've upset you.
- No, I am simply stating that one has...

422
00:33:01.066 --> 00:33:02.566
What were you doing?

423
00:33:02.734 --> 00:33:05.361
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.

424
00:33:28.593 --> 00:33:31.429
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

425
00:33:31.638 --> 00:33:34.265
- Are you wearing a false...?
- False nose? No.

426
00:33:34.516 --> 00:33:36.851
- Tell me that that wasn't...
- That wasn't.

427
00:33:38.395 --> 00:33:40.855
Holmes. Where are you going?

428
00:33:44.776 --> 00:33:46.277
Watson.

429
00:33:48.363 --> 00:33:49.697
Watson.

430
00:34:08.633 --> 00:34:12.553
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.

431
00:34:12.721 --> 00:34:16.599
My lucky day.

432
00:34:17.351 --> 00:34:19.643
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?

433
00:34:23.398 --> 00:34:25.107
Don't move.

434
00:34:29.071 --> 00:34:30.196
Now, what have we got here?

435
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:32.656
It's...

436
00:34:36.078 --> 00:34:37.703
Thank you.

437
00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.790
That's the Irene I know.

438
00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.507
Good boy.

439
00:35:32.884 --> 00:35:35.344
This man intrigues me, Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.

440
00:35:35.512 --> 00:35:37.888
- Which is no mean feat.
- She's intimidated.

441
00:35:38.056 --> 00:35:39.223
She's scared of him.

442
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:40.558
Yet she works for him.

443
00:35:42.269 --> 00:35:44.103
- Right.
- It's nothing to do with me...

444
00:35:44.271 --> 00:35:47.022
...but I advise you leave the case alone.

445
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.732
Well, I may not have a choice.

446
00:35:49.943 --> 00:35:53.028
After all, I may be paying the rent
on my own soon, thanks to you.

447
00:35:53.572 --> 00:35:56.073
- Get that out of my face.
- It's not. It's in my hand.

448
00:35:56.241 --> 00:35:57.718
Get what's in your hand
out of my face.

449
00:35:57.742 --> 00:35:59.034
- Mr. Holmes?
- Clarkie.

450
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:02.329
Sir, lnspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me at once.

451
00:36:02.497 --> 00:36:05.166
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

452
00:36:05.333 --> 00:36:07.418
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."

453
00:36:07.586 --> 00:36:09.086
No, "you" means you.

454
00:36:09.254 --> 00:36:11.672
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh...

455
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.174
Well...

456
00:36:13.592 --> 00:36:16.635
...it appears he's come back
from the grave, sir.

457
00:36:24.394 --> 00:36:27.396
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.

458
00:36:27.564 --> 00:36:29.440
I pronounced the man dead myself.

459
00:36:31.401 --> 00:36:32.860
What are the facts?

460
00:36:33.028 --> 00:36:36.280
Groundskeeper saw him walking
through the graveyard this morning.

461
00:36:36.907 --> 00:36:39.158
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

462
00:36:39.701 --> 00:36:43.913
- I have an appointment with Mary.
- It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

463
00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.623
Don't try that.

464
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:49.043
- The newspapers got wind of it?
- That's what we're trying to avoid.

465
00:36:49.211 --> 00:36:50.794
Certainly.

466
00:36:51.087 --> 00:36:52.421
What's the major concern?

467
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:55.049
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

468
00:36:55.217 --> 00:36:58.093
- Indeed.
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?

469
00:36:58.261 --> 00:36:59.762
Yes, as you should.

470
00:37:01.723 --> 00:37:03.807
It's a matter of professional integrity.

471
00:37:03.975 --> 00:37:07.937
No girl wants to marry a doctor
who can't tell if a man's dead or not.

472
00:37:23.995 --> 00:37:26.288
Who do you think won the match,
Clarkie?

473
00:37:26.456 --> 00:37:28.874
- Sir?
- The rugby match.

474
00:37:29.501 --> 00:37:33.170
Your boys have done a magnificent job
obliterating any potential evidence.

475
00:37:33.338 --> 00:37:37.341
Yes. But at least they never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

476
00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:42.346
You took your time, Holmes.

477
00:37:42.514 --> 00:37:45.683
"And on the third day"...

478
00:37:47.852 --> 00:37:50.479
These slabs are half a ton each
if they're a pound...

479
00:37:50.647 --> 00:37:52.731
...and they're smashed open
from the inside.

480
00:37:52.899 --> 00:37:55.526
Lestrade, what of the coffin?

481
00:37:55.694 --> 00:37:59.029
- We are in the process of bringing it up.
- I see.

482
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:04.285
Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

483
00:38:06.871 --> 00:38:08.622
Anyhow, where's our witness?

484
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.082
He's over there.

485
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.418
And apparently, he is cata...

486
00:38:12.586 --> 00:38:13.627
Cat...

487
00:38:13.795 --> 00:38:15.296
Catatonic, sir.

488
00:38:16.214 --> 00:38:18.382
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.

489
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:24.388
If you lot don't stop behaving like
quivering milkmaids, you're on double-time.

490
00:38:24.556 --> 00:38:28.058
Now, you get down there
and you bring that coffin up now.

491
00:38:28.226 --> 00:38:30.644
Good day, sir.

492
00:38:31.563 --> 00:38:33.230
Hello.

493
00:38:34.441 --> 00:38:35.983
It's all right.

494
00:38:36.151 --> 00:38:37.860
I'm a doctor.

495
00:38:48.038 --> 00:38:50.497
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.

496
00:38:51.291 --> 00:38:55.336
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

497
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:56.962
Well?

498
00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.257
- Well?
- You pronounced him dead.

499
00:39:00.425 --> 00:39:02.926
He had no pulse.

500
00:39:07.766 --> 00:39:09.266
Ready.

501
00:39:10.101 --> 00:39:11.602
Down.

502
00:39:23.615 --> 00:39:25.115
Good Lord.

503
00:39:26.785 --> 00:39:28.285
That's not Blackwood.

504
00:39:29.954 --> 00:39:33.290
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

505
00:39:37.879 --> 00:39:39.296
Time of death?

506
00:39:41.466 --> 00:39:43.842
Diptera is...

507
00:39:44.719 --> 00:39:46.512
...approximately...

508
00:39:47.263 --> 00:39:50.265
...two thirds of an inch
which would put the time of death...

509
00:39:50.433 --> 00:39:52.476
...at between 10 and 12 hours ago.

510
00:39:53.144 --> 00:39:54.978
May I borrow your pen?

511
00:39:59.567 --> 00:40:02.069
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.

512
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.288
I know what I saw.

513
00:40:15.125 --> 00:40:16.500
It was Blackwood.

514
00:40:17.836 --> 00:40:20.129
As clear as I see you.

515
00:40:21.923 --> 00:40:24.591
And when the dead walk...

516
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.345
...the living will fill these coffins.

517
00:40:30.574 --> 00:40:32.742
Well...

518
00:40:36.664 --> 00:40:38.915
Right. Put the lid on
and clean this lot up.

519
00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:41.125
You really believe he was resurrected?

520
00:40:41.293 --> 00:40:43.294
The question is not if, but how.

521
00:40:43.462 --> 00:40:45.463
- The game's afoot.
- Follow your spirit...

522
00:40:45.631 --> 00:40:47.381
And upon this charge, cry:

523
00:40:47.508 --> 00:40:50.885
"God for Harry, England and St. George."

524
00:40:53.472 --> 00:40:54.681
There you are.

525
00:40:54.973 --> 00:40:57.433
Why that certain chips stall,
I don't understand.

526
00:40:57.601 --> 00:41:01.813
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.

527
00:41:02.147 --> 00:41:05.775
You know, Holmes,
I've seen things in war I don't understand.

528
00:41:05.943 --> 00:41:08.236
I once met a man
who predicted his own death...

529
00:41:08.404 --> 00:41:10.738
...right down to the number
and the placement...

530
00:41:10.906 --> 00:41:13.157
...of the bullets that killed him.

531
00:41:13.325 --> 00:41:14.909
You have to admit, Holmes...

532
00:41:15.077 --> 00:41:17.704
...that a supernatural explanation
to this case...

533
00:41:17.871 --> 00:41:19.997
...is theoretically possible.

534
00:41:20.165 --> 00:41:25.169
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake
to theorize before one has data.

535
00:41:25.337 --> 00:41:28.089
Inevitably one begins to twist facts
to suit theories...

536
00:41:28.257 --> 00:41:30.466
...instead of theories to suit facts.

537
00:41:30.634 --> 00:41:34.512
That said, I believe Adler's midget
is the key to this.

538
00:41:36.181 --> 00:41:39.350
Right. Scratches around
the keyhole where the watch was wound.

539
00:41:39.518 --> 00:41:42.145
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.

540
00:41:42.312 --> 00:41:45.690
Every time he wound the watch
his hand would slip, hence the scratches.

541
00:41:45.858 --> 00:41:46.899
Very good, Watson.

542
00:41:47.067 --> 00:41:50.778
You've developed considerable
deductive powers of your own.

543
00:41:50.946 --> 00:41:53.698
Let's see now, there are several
sets of initials scored...

544
00:41:53.866 --> 00:41:55.408
- Pawnbrokers' marks.
- Excellent.

545
00:41:55.576 --> 00:41:59.871
Most recent of which are "M.H."
M.H. M.H. is for?

546
00:42:00.038 --> 00:42:02.582
- Maddison and Haig.
- Maddison and Haig.

547
00:42:06.378 --> 00:42:08.713
They should be able to
give us an address.

548
00:42:12.718 --> 00:42:14.427
What a coincidence.

549
00:42:15.387 --> 00:42:18.055
There's one thing you've
failed to deduce from the watch.

550
00:42:18.223 --> 00:42:19.640
Really? I think not.

551
00:42:19.808 --> 00:42:23.019
The time. I have to get back, Holmes.

552
00:42:23.187 --> 00:42:25.062
Taking tea with the in-laws.

553
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.523
- Reckon your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.

554
00:42:27.691 --> 00:42:30.234
- No, thank you.
- You need to hear what I have to tell.

555
00:42:30.402 --> 00:42:32.737
We have no need of your lucky heather,
gypsy woman.

556
00:42:32.905 --> 00:42:35.156
Even if it's to do with Mary?

557
00:42:41.747 --> 00:42:44.749
I see two men. Brothers.

558
00:42:44.917 --> 00:42:46.751
Not in blood, but in bond.

559
00:42:50.923 --> 00:42:52.131
What of Mary?

560
00:42:52.299 --> 00:42:56.093
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.

561
00:42:57.095 --> 00:42:58.262
Go on.

562
00:42:58.597 --> 00:43:01.641
I see patterned tablecloths...

563
00:43:01.809 --> 00:43:04.268
...and, oh, china figurines...

564
00:43:04.436 --> 00:43:06.395
...and, oh, lace doilies.

565
00:43:07.105 --> 00:43:08.105
Doilies.

566
00:43:08.273 --> 00:43:11.776
Lace doilies? Holmes.

567
00:43:12.236 --> 00:43:15.238
Does your depravity know no bounds?

568
00:43:15.405 --> 00:43:17.240
- No.
- Oh, she turns to fat...

569
00:43:17.407 --> 00:43:19.242
...and, oh, she has a beard and...

570
00:43:19.409 --> 00:43:21.577
- What of the warts?
- She's covered in warts.

571
00:43:21.745 --> 00:43:23.371
- Enough.
- Are they extensive?

572
00:43:23.539 --> 00:43:25.456
Please, enough.

573
00:43:26.834 --> 00:43:29.794
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.

574
00:43:30.796 --> 00:43:33.339
And precisely the reason
you can't find a suitable ring.

575
00:43:33.507 --> 00:43:34.590
Do you have my money?

576
00:43:34.758 --> 00:43:37.301
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre.

577
00:43:37.469 --> 00:43:39.554
- Do you have my cut from the fight?
- Admit it.

578
00:43:39.721 --> 00:43:41.806
- Give me my money! Holmes.
- Admit it!

579
00:43:43.642 --> 00:43:45.518
I see.

580
00:43:51.692 --> 00:43:53.025
Thank you.

581
00:43:55.195 --> 00:43:58.823
Well, you've got your ring and
I've got my address for the ginger midget.

582
00:43:58.991 --> 00:44:02.493
- Should be just there.
- I think she'll really like this.

583
00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:06.414
And I have some change in my pocket.

584
00:44:10.294 --> 00:44:13.337
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No, no.

585
00:44:14.172 --> 00:44:16.090
- Don't give it away here.
- No.

586
00:44:16.258 --> 00:44:18.259
I have to go see Mary.

587
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.344
Give her my best.

588
00:44:21.221 --> 00:44:23.264
And her family, as well.

589
00:45:03.221 --> 00:45:05.389
It does make a considerable
difference to me...

590
00:45:05.557 --> 00:45:08.142
...having someone with me
on whom I can thoroughly rely.

591
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:11.812
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

592
00:45:13.899 --> 00:45:16.400
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

593
00:45:16.568 --> 00:45:18.444
Something did.

594
00:45:19.404 --> 00:45:21.197
Irene Adler was here.

595
00:45:21.406 --> 00:45:25.451
Either that or the ginger midget
wore the same Parisian perfume.

596
00:45:28.288 --> 00:45:30.748
Putrefaction.

597
00:45:35.379 --> 00:45:39.090
Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.

598
00:45:43.178 --> 00:45:44.929
Phosphorous.

599
00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:47.598
Formaldehyde.

600
00:45:59.277 --> 00:46:01.445
It looks like...

601
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.532
...he was attempting to combine...

602
00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:08.077
...some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

603
00:46:16.044 --> 00:46:17.962
More importantly...

604
00:46:18.547 --> 00:46:21.090
...let's see what he was
trying to dispose of.

605
00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.885
- Potassium, magnesium.
- Sultaphytic acid.

606
00:46:25.053 --> 00:46:29.015
It'll suck the iron right out of the ink
as long as it's not too burnt.

607
00:46:43.822 --> 00:46:45.322
Peculiar.

608
00:46:47.743 --> 00:46:50.077
Hydrated rhododendron.

609
00:47:15.145 --> 00:47:17.354
Holmes.

610
00:47:17.522 --> 00:47:19.023
Look at the crest.

611
00:47:20.192 --> 00:47:21.942
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

612
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:23.861
Of course he was.

613
00:47:24.029 --> 00:47:26.322
The question is, to what end.

614
00:47:29.785 --> 00:47:33.537
Whatever he was working on,
he clearly succeeded.

615
00:47:33.705 --> 00:47:35.039
How so?

616
00:47:35.207 --> 00:47:37.416
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

617
00:47:37.584 --> 00:47:40.211
Which is why Miss Adler
is so desperate to find him.

618
00:47:40.879 --> 00:47:41.879
Yes.

619
00:47:42.047 --> 00:47:44.048
There is one odor
I can't quite put my finger on.

620
00:47:44.216 --> 00:47:47.551
Is it candy floss? Molasses?

621
00:47:47.719 --> 00:47:49.095
Maple syrup?

622
00:47:49.262 --> 00:47:50.387
Barley sugar.

623
00:47:50.555 --> 00:47:52.306
Toffee apple.

624
00:47:57.729 --> 00:47:59.396
Let me guess.

625
00:47:59.564 --> 00:48:01.690
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...

626
00:48:01.858 --> 00:48:05.820
...you're here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein.

627
00:48:05.987 --> 00:48:08.239
Just one minute, boys.

628
00:48:08.406 --> 00:48:10.199
Oh, Dredger.

629
00:48:29.886 --> 00:48:31.220
Meat...

630
00:48:31.555 --> 00:48:32.763
...or potatoes?

631
00:48:33.473 --> 00:48:35.141
My 10 minutes are up.

632
00:49:28.486 --> 00:49:29.987
You all right?

633
00:50:45.855 --> 00:50:47.398
Holmes...

634
00:50:48.024 --> 00:50:49.358
...what is that?

635
00:54:17.424 --> 00:54:18.758
Holmes!

636
00:55:12.396 --> 00:55:13.896
Watson...

637
00:55:14.398 --> 00:55:16.524
...what have you done?

638
00:55:27.703 --> 00:55:29.495
I haven't slept all night.

639
00:55:29.747 --> 00:55:31.664
Not a wink.

640
00:55:33.083 --> 00:55:35.501
Why I ever believed...

641
00:55:35.753 --> 00:55:39.422
...that I would get to have tea
with Mary's parents is beyond me...

642
00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:43.801
- ...having been talked into going with you.
- We were set upon. It was self-defense.

643
00:55:43.969 --> 00:55:48.222
I've been reviewing my notes
on our exploits over the last seven months.

644
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:50.183
Would you like to know my conclusion?

645
00:55:50.768 --> 00:55:53.686
- I am psychologically disturbed.
- How so?

646
00:55:53.854 --> 00:55:58.024
Why else would I continually be
led into situations...

647
00:55:58.192 --> 00:56:02.779
...where you deliberately withhold
your plans from me? Why else?

648
00:56:03.614 --> 00:56:06.949
You've never complained
about my methods before.

649
00:56:07.117 --> 00:56:09.410
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?

650
00:56:09.578 --> 00:56:11.454
How am I complaining? I never complain.

651
00:56:11.622 --> 00:56:14.540
Do I complain about you practicing
the violin in the morning...

652
00:56:14.708 --> 00:56:18.920
...or your mess, your lack of hygiene,
or the fact that you steal my clothes?

653
00:56:19.088 --> 00:56:20.296
We have a barter system.

654
00:56:20.464 --> 00:56:22.799
Do I complain
about you setting fire to my rooms?

655
00:56:22.966 --> 00:56:24.008
- Our rooms.
- The rooms.

656
00:56:24.176 --> 00:56:26.803
When do I complain
that you experiment on my dog?

657
00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:28.137
- Our dog.
- On the dog.

658
00:56:28.305 --> 00:56:29.764
Gladstone is our dog.

659
00:56:29.932 --> 00:56:34.977
Where I do take issue is your campaign
to sabotage my relationship with Mary.

660
00:56:42.653 --> 00:56:44.028
I understand.

661
00:56:44.196 --> 00:56:45.905
- Do you?
- I do.

662
00:56:47.116 --> 00:56:49.534
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.

663
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.661
- Yes.
- You're feeling sensitive.

664
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:52.995
I'm not sensitive.

665
00:56:53.163 --> 00:56:55.373
What you need is a rest.

666
00:56:55.541 --> 00:56:58.209
My brother, Mycroft,
has a small estate near Chichester.

667
00:56:58.377 --> 00:57:02.797
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.
We can throw a lamb on the spit.

668
00:57:02.965 --> 00:57:06.759
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country,
it would be with my future wife.

669
00:57:06.927 --> 00:57:10.012
- Well, certainly, if we must...
- No, not you. Mary and I.

670
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.973
- You are not...
- What, invited?

671
00:57:12.141 --> 00:57:14.767
Why would I not be invited
to my brother's country home?

672
00:57:14.935 --> 00:57:16.477
Now you're not making any sense.

673
00:57:16.645 --> 00:57:17.687
You're not human.

674
00:57:17.855 --> 00:57:19.188
John Watson?

675
00:57:20.607 --> 00:57:21.732
Yes.

676
00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.693
Your bail's been posted.

677
00:57:29.616 --> 00:57:31.117
Mary.

678
00:57:34.788 --> 00:57:36.456
Just Watson.

679
00:57:44.006 --> 00:57:47.717
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because the boys are getting hungry.

680
00:57:52.556 --> 00:57:54.223
Step lively.

681
00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:00.104
Back off. Back off.

682
00:58:00.272 --> 00:58:02.732
To which the barman says,
"May I push in your stool?"

683
00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:07.862
Right, you, you're out.

684
00:58:09.031 --> 00:58:10.573
Until next time, Big Joe.

685
00:58:10.741 --> 00:58:13.117
Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

686
00:58:14.203 --> 00:58:16.829
Thank heaven you're here.
I'd almost run out of jokes.

687
00:58:16.997 --> 00:58:19.191
In another life,
you'd have made an excellent criminal.

688
00:58:19.291 --> 00:58:22.668
And you, sir, an excellent policeman.
Tomski, thank you.

689
00:58:23.795 --> 00:58:25.630
Now, please tell me you have answers.

690
00:58:25.797 --> 00:58:28.090
All in good time, Lestrade.

691
00:58:28.258 --> 00:58:31.761
{\an8}"All in good time"? Is this some parlor
game where we guess what you're thinking?

692
00:58:31.929 --> 00:58:35.139
I've got a public in frenzy out there.
If you don't fill me in...

693
00:58:35.307 --> 00:58:39.143
...I'll have you in there playing Victoria
and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.

694
00:58:39.478 --> 00:58:42.438
Now, clean up
and make yourself presentable.

695
00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:43.940
For whom?

696
00:58:44.107 --> 00:58:47.818
Friends in high places.
They're the ones who bailed you out.

697
00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:01.874
I'm terribly sorry
to inconvenience you, sir...

698
00:59:02.042 --> 00:59:04.460
...but I'm gonna have to put this on you.

699
00:59:08.131 --> 00:59:12.635
Mr. Holmes,
apologies for summoning you like this.

700
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:16.597
I'm sure it's quite a mystery
as to where you are and who I am.

701
00:59:16.848 --> 00:59:18.140
As to where I am...

702
00:59:18.559 --> 00:59:22.478
<i>...I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.</i>

703
00:59:22.646 --> 00:59:25.773
But I was saved by the bread shop
on Saffron Hill...

704
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:29.485
<i>...the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their loaves...</i>

705
00:59:29.653 --> 00:59:30.903
<i>...a Brittany sage.</i>

706
00:59:31.071 --> 00:59:35.825
The carriage forked left, then right,
a telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit.

707
00:59:35.993 --> 00:59:39.996
And as to who you are, that took every
ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.

708
00:59:40.163 --> 00:59:43.499
The letters on your desk are addressed
to Sir Thomas Rotheram.

709
00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:46.085
Lord Chief Justice,
that'd be your official title.

710
00:59:46.253 --> 00:59:49.839
Who you really are is, of course,
another matter entirely.

711
00:59:50.465 --> 00:59:52.341
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...

712
00:59:52.509 --> 00:59:55.052
...you're the head of
the Temple of the Four Orders...

713
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.013
...in whose headquarters we now sit...

714
00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.349
...on the northwest corner
of St. James's Square, I think.

715
01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:04.937
As to the mystery, the only mystery is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all.

716
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:11.360
Yes, well, standard procedure,
I suppose.

717
01:00:13.196 --> 01:00:15.531
I daresay we have the right man,
gentlemen.

718
01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:18.451
Sherlock Holmes,
Ambassador Standish from America...

719
01:00:18.619 --> 01:00:20.536
...and Lord Coward, the home secretary.

720
01:00:21.246 --> 01:00:25.041
I suppose you already have some notion
as to the practices of our order.

721
01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:27.710
Yes.

722
01:00:27.878 --> 01:00:30.546
They're practically interesting.

723
01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:32.131
Be as skeptical as you like.

724
01:00:32.299 --> 01:00:35.760
But our secret systems have steered
the world towards good for centuries.

725
01:00:35.927 --> 01:00:39.347
The danger is they can also be used
for more nefarious purposes.

726
01:00:39.514 --> 01:00:42.308
What some call the dark arts,
or practical magic.

727
01:00:42.476 --> 01:00:46.062
We know you don't believe
in magic, Mr. Holmes.

728
01:00:46.229 --> 01:00:48.814
We don't expect you to share our faith...

729
01:00:48.982 --> 01:00:50.399
...merely our fears.

730
01:00:50.567 --> 01:00:53.152
Fear is the more infectious condition.

731
01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.321
In this instance...

732
01:00:57.699 --> 01:00:59.408
...fear of your own child.

733
01:01:02.704 --> 01:01:04.372
Blackwood is your son.

734
01:01:04.539 --> 01:01:08.001
You have the same irises,
a rare dark green...

735
01:01:08.169 --> 01:01:10.087
...with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...

736
01:01:10.254 --> 01:01:14.257
...together with identical outer ears, which
are only passed down through bloodline...

737
01:01:14.425 --> 01:01:16.468
...which makes you either brothers...

738
01:01:16.636 --> 01:01:19.388
...or, in this case, more likely,
father and son.

739
01:01:24.686 --> 01:01:27.854
Very few people
are privy to that information...

740
01:01:28.022 --> 01:01:29.856
...and we want to keep it that way.

741
01:01:34.654 --> 01:01:36.780
He was conceived
during one of our rituals.

742
01:01:36.948 --> 01:01:38.365
His mother wasn't my wife...

743
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:40.784
...but she shared our beliefs.

744
01:01:40.952 --> 01:01:43.120
She was a powerful practitioner...

745
01:01:43.287 --> 01:01:45.956
...though not enough
to survive giving birth to him.

746
01:01:47.959 --> 01:01:49.960
Death followed him wherever he went.

747
01:01:50.128 --> 01:01:52.546
Those five girls were not the first
to be butchered.

748
01:01:52.714 --> 01:01:55.882
He killed many more,
using them to enhance his powers.

749
01:01:56.467 --> 01:01:59.636
No one could prove anything,
of course, but we all knew.

750
01:02:00.805 --> 01:02:02.347
The boy was a curse.

751
01:02:02.515 --> 01:02:05.475
We've done our best to stop him,
but it's not enough.

752
01:02:05.643 --> 01:02:07.060
His power grows daily.

753
01:02:07.228 --> 01:02:09.312
His resurrection is evidence of that.

754
01:02:09.814 --> 01:02:11.982
But what he does next
will be more dangerous.

755
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:16.653
His secret lies in the book
of spells. This is the source of his power.

756
01:02:17.238 --> 01:02:20.115
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the course of the world.

757
01:02:20.283 --> 01:02:23.076
We want you to find him
and stop him before he does.

758
01:02:23.953 --> 01:02:26.872
We'll give you any assistance
that we can.

759
01:02:27.999 --> 01:02:31.501
As home secretary, I have considerable
influence over the police.

760
01:02:31.669 --> 01:02:33.211
Yes.

761
01:02:34.964 --> 01:02:36.298
So...

762
01:02:38.134 --> 01:02:39.552
...name your price.

763
01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:41.928
The benefit of being
a consulting detective...

764
01:02:42.096 --> 01:02:44.181
...is that I can pick and choose
my clients.

765
01:02:45.016 --> 01:02:46.850
So consider it done, I'll stop him.

766
01:02:48.478 --> 01:02:50.312
But not for you.

767
01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.439
And certainly not for a price.

768
01:02:55.777 --> 01:02:59.279
- I do have a parting query, Sir Thomas.
- What is that?

769
01:02:59.447 --> 01:03:03.283
If the rest of his family's dead,
how long do you expect to survive?

770
01:03:04.702 --> 01:03:05.786
Food for thought.

771
01:03:30.728 --> 01:03:34.231
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck
opening that.

772
01:03:34.774 --> 01:03:38.068
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.

773
01:03:38.653 --> 01:03:42.572
How fascinating that an astronomical event
can affect the quality...

774
01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.242
How is it going with our case
you refuse to take?

775
01:03:45.409 --> 01:03:46.743
...of the wine.

776
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:50.831
Oh, I've hit a dead end, literally.

777
01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:53.917
I found your man.

778
01:03:54.085 --> 01:03:56.419
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.

779
01:03:57.296 --> 01:03:58.672
If you still need him.

780
01:04:00.591 --> 01:04:02.425
Oh, dear.

781
01:04:04.387 --> 01:04:07.597
Hope my client
doesn't come looking for a refund.

782
01:04:07.765 --> 01:04:09.099
He's a professor, isn't he?

783
01:04:09.267 --> 01:04:12.185
<i>Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.</i>

784
01:04:12.353 --> 01:04:16.606
I've never known a professor to carry
a gun, and on such a clever contraption.

785
01:04:20.653 --> 01:04:23.113
Eye patch, nice touch.

786
01:04:24.031 --> 01:04:26.116
So case closed...

787
01:04:26.284 --> 01:04:29.286
...which makes this a social visit.

788
01:04:29.453 --> 01:04:32.372
No, it's a "you're in over your head,
Irene" visit.

789
01:04:33.082 --> 01:04:35.584
Whoever killed Reordan
was covering their tracks...

790
01:04:35.751 --> 01:04:37.961
...which makes you the next loose end
to be snipped.

791
01:04:40.006 --> 01:04:41.673
Let it breathe.

792
01:04:42.633 --> 01:04:44.759
I've never been in over my head.

793
01:04:44.927 --> 01:04:48.471
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.

794
01:04:48.639 --> 01:04:52.726
Or stay and volunteer
for protective custody.

795
01:04:55.813 --> 01:04:59.316
If I'm in danger, so are you.

796
01:05:02.987 --> 01:05:04.654
Come with me.

797
01:05:07.283 --> 01:05:08.992
What if we trusted each other?

798
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:11.953
You're not listening.

799
01:05:12.121 --> 01:05:16.708
I'm taking you to either the
railway station or the police station.

800
01:05:28.554 --> 01:05:30.013
So...

801
01:05:33.351 --> 01:05:35.185
- Which is it to be?
- Careful.

802
01:05:37.063 --> 01:05:38.688
You decide.

803
01:05:38.856 --> 01:05:41.274
- Which will it be?
- What...?

804
01:05:41.859 --> 01:05:43.735
I told you to let it breathe.

805
01:05:44.528 --> 01:05:46.696
Can you taste the comet?

806
01:05:52.745 --> 01:05:56.122
Why couldn't you just
come away with me?

807
01:05:57.458 --> 01:05:59.209
Never.

808
01:07:45.941 --> 01:07:50.153
Madam, I need you to remain calm
and trust me, I'm a professional.

809
01:07:50.321 --> 01:07:52.822
But beneath this pillow
lies the key to my release.

810
01:07:54.158 --> 01:07:57.327
<i>- She misinterpreted my intention entirely.
- Naturally, sir.</i>

811
01:07:57.495 --> 01:08:00.288
That's why I find this modern
religious fervor so troubling.

812
01:08:00.456 --> 01:08:03.708
- No latitude for misunderstanding.
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.

813
01:08:03.876 --> 01:08:06.878
Indeed. And chambermaids
were once such a liberal breed.

814
01:08:07.046 --> 01:08:09.339
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.

815
01:08:11.467 --> 01:08:15.386
Anyhow, a good thing she was offended,
or we may never have found you.

816
01:08:15.554 --> 01:08:19.307
The inspector's been over to Baker Street
himself this morning, sir.

817
01:08:23.104 --> 01:08:25.188
Just joking about the wife, sir.

818
01:08:29.735 --> 01:08:31.236
We've checked everything, sir.

819
01:08:31.403 --> 01:08:34.239
No sign of a break-in
and the butler didn't hear a thing.

820
01:08:34.406 --> 01:08:36.574
So body in the bathtub...

821
01:08:36.742 --> 01:08:40.995
...his eyes were wide open,
and the only thing missing was...

822
01:08:41.997 --> 01:08:44.040
...his ring, sir.

823
01:09:00.182 --> 01:09:01.891
Why did you drain the water?

824
01:09:02.059 --> 01:09:05.728
- Out of common decency.
- Crime is common, logic is rare.

825
01:09:05.896 --> 01:09:09.899
The decent thing to do is to catch the
killer, not provide comfort for the corpse.

826
01:09:24.582 --> 01:09:26.082
What is that?

827
01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:31.588
- Jasmine bath salts, sir.
- Superb.

828
01:09:31.755 --> 01:09:35.383
Probably comes from a larger container.
It'll either be in the pantry...

829
01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:39.262
...high up where it's warm and dry,
or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

830
01:09:40.264 --> 01:09:41.764
Constable, you could do worse...

831
01:09:41.932 --> 01:09:45.226
...than to check the ground under
the rear windows for any footprints.

832
01:09:45.394 --> 01:09:48.104
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.

833
01:10:47.414 --> 01:10:49.082
Mr. Holmes?

834
01:10:57.633 --> 01:10:59.884
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?

835
01:11:00.052 --> 01:11:01.844
It was in the pantry, sir.

836
01:11:02.304 --> 01:11:04.097
I don't know what to make of this.

837
01:11:04.265 --> 01:11:06.015
Excellent work.

838
01:11:06.183 --> 01:11:07.934
<i>Adieu.</i>

839
01:11:45.889 --> 01:11:49.392
What's the meaning of this, Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?

840
01:11:50.602 --> 01:11:51.853
Sir Thomas is dead.

841
01:11:54.064 --> 01:11:57.066
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the order.

842
01:12:00.112 --> 01:12:02.113
Have you lost your mind?

843
01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:04.240
You know damn well
what he's capable of.

844
01:12:04.408 --> 01:12:06.284
Of course he does.

845
01:12:08.203 --> 01:12:10.038
That's why we're here.

846
01:12:11.582 --> 01:12:13.249
That's why we're all here.

847
01:12:19.256 --> 01:12:22.925
My powers and my assets
were given to me for one purpose.

848
01:12:23.302 --> 01:12:27.472
A magnificent but simple purpose.

849
01:12:28.599 --> 01:12:30.683
To create a new future.

850
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:34.771
A future ruled...

851
01:12:34.938 --> 01:12:36.689
...by us.

852
01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:43.780
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history.

853
01:12:45.282 --> 01:12:46.657
Magic will lead the way.

854
01:12:46.825 --> 01:12:49.285
Once the people of England
see our newfound power...

855
01:12:49.453 --> 01:12:51.371
...they'll bow down in fear.

856
01:12:56.335 --> 01:13:00.129
Across the Atlantic
lies a colony that was once ours.

857
01:13:00.297 --> 01:13:01.631
It will be again.

858
01:13:02.549 --> 01:13:04.801
The Civil War has made them weak.

859
01:13:04.968 --> 01:13:09.806
Their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours...

860
01:13:09.973 --> 01:13:12.183
...so we'll take it back.

861
01:13:13.811 --> 01:13:16.187
We will remake the world...

862
01:13:17.898 --> 01:13:19.607
...create the future.

863
01:13:20.901 --> 01:13:24.654
These men are with me, Standish...

864
01:13:24.822 --> 01:13:26.364
...but...

865
01:13:26.657 --> 01:13:28.032
...are you?

866
01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.411
No, sir. I am not.

867
01:13:32.413 --> 01:13:35.289
These powers that you're playing with...

868
01:13:35.457 --> 01:13:37.500
...no man can control.

869
01:13:39.628 --> 01:13:41.421
Well, gentlemen...

870
01:13:42.923 --> 01:13:46.342
...someone has to stop him,
even if you won't.

871
01:13:48.595 --> 01:13:50.680
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

872
01:13:55.894 --> 01:13:57.895
Save me!

873
01:14:13.996 --> 01:14:15.663
Gentlemen...

874
01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:17.707
...don't be afraid.

875
01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:20.501
As you can see...

876
01:14:21.753 --> 01:14:23.796
...we are protected.

877
01:14:25.048 --> 01:14:27.550
Come, drink your allegiance here.

878
01:14:33.807 --> 01:14:37.560
You control the police, now use them.

879
01:14:49.323 --> 01:14:50.573
Didn't know you were here.

880
01:14:50.741 --> 01:14:53.993
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I utilize it?

881
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:56.871
Be my guest.

882
01:14:58.373 --> 01:15:00.317
- In here, chaps.
- Where would you like me...

883
01:15:00.417 --> 01:15:02.835
- ...to put him, sir?
- Anywhere is fine.

884
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:16.557
- Who is he?
- The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.

885
01:15:16.725 --> 01:15:19.602
His neck didn't survive the impact
of Dredger landing on him.

886
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:21.771
Yes.

887
01:15:22.439 --> 01:15:24.315
Thanks for that, by the way.

888
01:15:26.276 --> 01:15:30.821
There is consolation in the knowledge that
he could be of service to his fellow man.

889
01:15:34.785 --> 01:15:39.455
Elbows and arms stained with blood,
but it's older than his own injuries.

890
01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.463
None of it human.

891
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:49.882
He's not a butcher, let me see.

892
01:16:00.018 --> 01:16:02.270
Yellow flame, green bursts.

893
01:16:02.854 --> 01:16:04.146
An industrial worker.

894
01:16:08.385 --> 01:16:09.719
Coal.

895
01:16:09.987 --> 01:16:11.612
River silt.

896
01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.156
The slag on his trousers
should put him squarely in...

897
01:16:14.324 --> 01:16:16.492
- Nine Elms.
- Sorry, what?

898
01:16:17.077 --> 01:16:19.328
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.

899
01:16:19.496 --> 01:16:21.330
I wondered.

900
01:16:21.498 --> 01:16:24.834
Do you remember where I put
the Lords Register of members' interests?

901
01:16:25.002 --> 01:16:26.377
It's on the stepladder.

902
01:16:36.847 --> 01:16:41.350
Well, Blackwood's had his hand in just about
everything that's corrosive to the spirit.

903
01:16:41.977 --> 01:16:44.937
Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works.

904
01:16:45.105 --> 01:16:47.106
It'll probably be a factory by the river.

905
01:16:47.524 --> 01:16:49.025
What's that?

906
01:16:49.443 --> 01:16:50.943
Never mind.

907
01:16:52.779 --> 01:16:55.031
You don't know where
my rugby ball went, do you?

908
01:16:55.198 --> 01:16:56.532
No, not a clue.

909
01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:59.660
Queenshithe Slaughterhouse.

910
01:16:59.828 --> 01:17:01.203
Nine Elms.

911
01:17:01.371 --> 01:17:03.372
A factory by the river.

912
01:17:03.749 --> 01:17:06.709
Well done. That should lead us
to Blackwood, dead or alive.

913
01:17:07.294 --> 01:17:08.961
Not us.

914
01:17:10.797 --> 01:17:12.131
You.

915
01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:14.050
Yes.

916
01:17:15.427 --> 01:17:17.678
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

917
01:17:26.772 --> 01:17:28.064
He's left it there on purpose.

918
01:17:48.585 --> 01:17:51.045
More coal, doctor.

919
01:17:55.509 --> 01:17:58.219
That's a good one. He's such a tit.

920
01:17:58.387 --> 01:17:59.929
Oh, God. Yeah.

921
01:18:00.097 --> 01:18:01.931
Glad to see you two
are working hard.

922
01:18:02.099 --> 01:18:04.767
And I thought we were
trying to be discreet.

923
01:18:04.935 --> 01:18:08.771
You would not last one day in the navy.

924
01:18:11.108 --> 01:18:15.027
Are you sure there isn't an alternative
means of water transportation than that?

925
01:18:15.195 --> 01:18:18.781
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.

926
01:18:19.032 --> 01:18:22.451
- Tanner's practically a fish himself.
- He certainly drinks like one.

927
01:18:22.619 --> 01:18:24.787
Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor.

928
01:18:24.955 --> 01:18:27.206
If only just a sense.

929
01:18:27.624 --> 01:18:31.544
I better take over, there.
Bit tricky down here.

930
01:18:52.691 --> 01:18:54.608
Come on, come on.

931
01:19:09.916 --> 01:19:11.459
- Look familiar?
- Yep.

932
01:19:11.626 --> 01:19:14.295
All that's missing is a ginger midget.

933
01:19:26.725 --> 01:19:29.226
They cleared something away from here
not minutes ago.

934
01:19:29.394 --> 01:19:30.978
Like what?

935
01:19:31.271 --> 01:19:34.356
Not sure. Something mechanical.

936
01:19:34.524 --> 01:19:36.150
Holmes.

937
01:19:36.777 --> 01:19:38.527
Look at this.

938
01:20:02.636 --> 01:20:04.303
- 1:18.
- Chapter and verse.

939
01:20:04.471 --> 01:20:08.224
Revelations 1:18.
"I am he that liveth, and was dead."

940
01:20:08.642 --> 01:20:11.644
"And behold, I'm alive for evermore."

941
01:20:12.771 --> 01:20:16.649
I warned you, Holmes, to accept
that this was beyond your control...

942
01:20:16.817 --> 01:20:19.693
...beyond what your rational mind
could comprehend.

943
01:20:21.279 --> 01:20:25.241
- What a busy afterlife you're having.
- I want you to bear witness.

944
01:20:25.867 --> 01:20:30.329
Tomorrow, at midday,
the world as you know it will end.

945
01:20:30.497 --> 01:20:32.915
Show me your face,
it'll be the end of your world.

946
01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:35.042
Save your bullets, Watson.

947
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:36.710
A gift for you.

948
01:20:42.092 --> 01:20:44.176
What was that about saving bullets?

949
01:20:50.517 --> 01:20:52.893
She followed you here, Holmes.

950
01:20:54.896 --> 01:20:57.773
You led your lamb to slaughter.

951
01:21:00.735 --> 01:21:02.111
Holmes.

952
01:21:03.697 --> 01:21:05.447
This game was designed to hurt.

953
01:21:17.210 --> 01:21:18.544
Watson!

954
01:21:22.799 --> 01:21:23.966
It's warm in here, Watson.

955
01:21:31.308 --> 01:21:32.808
In over your head yet, darling?

956
01:21:40.734 --> 01:21:42.443
- Hold on there.
- I can't.

957
01:21:42.611 --> 01:21:44.278
Let me take your weight.

958
01:21:45.405 --> 01:21:47.197
Give us a leg up, old boy.

959
01:21:49.701 --> 01:21:51.493
These German locks
always give me trouble.

960
01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:58.751
It's a band saw.

961
01:22:02.172 --> 01:22:04.173
No matter, we have plenty of time.

962
01:22:05.884 --> 01:22:07.217
Holmes.

963
01:22:15.352 --> 01:22:17.353
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.

964
01:22:25.487 --> 01:22:27.321
Holmes, hurry up.

965
01:22:34.871 --> 01:22:37.706
Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.

966
01:23:02.816 --> 01:23:04.817
And we'll bounce in three, two...

967
01:23:06.236 --> 01:23:07.403
...one.

968
01:23:17.998 --> 01:23:19.983
Thank you.

969
01:23:20.083 --> 01:23:21.750
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.

970
01:23:31.636 --> 01:23:33.053
Thank you.

971
01:23:33.471 --> 01:23:36.098
We should help the doctor.

972
01:23:47.527 --> 01:23:49.194
Holmes!

973
01:25:20.954 --> 01:25:22.746
Mr. Holmes.

974
01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:26.208
Sir.

975
01:25:29.754 --> 01:25:31.672
Mr. Holmes.

976
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:44.226
Mr. Holmes, we have an order
for your arrest, sir.

977
01:25:48.231 --> 01:25:49.314
Sir!

978
01:25:49.482 --> 01:25:53.151
Lord Coward has issued a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

979
01:25:54.445 --> 01:25:55.946
Now, Watson's alive.

980
01:25:56.114 --> 01:25:59.032
Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.

981
01:26:15.258 --> 01:26:17.175
Will the train be departing on time?

982
01:26:17.343 --> 01:26:19.636
The train's been delayed, madam.

983
01:26:19.804 --> 01:26:21.847
Shouldn't be long now, though.

984
01:26:38.156 --> 01:26:41.783
The train will depart when I tell it to.

985
01:26:43.411 --> 01:26:46.705
And you will leave my employment
when I allow you to.

986
01:26:51.044 --> 01:26:53.378
I fulfilled my contract.

987
01:26:53.546 --> 01:26:54.796
I found Reordan.

988
01:26:54.964 --> 01:26:57.132
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.

989
01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.134
So that's me, finished.

990
01:26:59.302 --> 01:27:03.180
Your job was to manipulate Holmes'
feelings for you...

991
01:27:03.348 --> 01:27:04.932
...not succumb to them.

992
01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:09.645
You have fulfilled nothing.

993
01:27:09.812 --> 01:27:12.481
I want what Reordan was making
for Blackwood.

994
01:27:13.107 --> 01:27:16.652
Finish the job or the next dead body...

995
01:27:16.819 --> 01:27:19.446
...will be Sherlock Holmes.

996
01:27:46.057 --> 01:27:48.016
The surgeon should be along shortly.

997
01:27:52.855 --> 01:27:55.190
He should be able to rest now.

998
01:27:58.319 --> 01:27:59.820
Excuse me.

999
01:28:03.825 --> 01:28:05.534
Is that the best you can do?

1000
01:28:05.702 --> 01:28:07.536
Yes, for now.

1001
01:28:07.704 --> 01:28:09.830
I must attend to my other patients.

1002
01:28:11.874 --> 01:28:13.250
Doctor.

1003
01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:15.377
Doctor.

1004
01:28:15.837 --> 01:28:17.462
Please.

1005
01:28:21.134 --> 01:28:24.386
I know that you care for him
as much as I do.

1006
01:28:24.554 --> 01:28:27.973
This is not your responsibility,
it was his choice.

1007
01:28:28.933 --> 01:28:31.893
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.

1008
01:28:38.526 --> 01:28:40.402
Solve this.

1009
01:28:41.237 --> 01:28:43.238
Whatever it takes.

1010
01:28:53.541 --> 01:28:55.417
<i>This is beyond your control.</i>

1011
01:28:55.585 --> 01:28:57.210
<i>Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic.</i>

1012
01:28:57.378 --> 01:29:00.172
<i>- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
- I've never been in over my head.</i>

1013
01:29:00.339 --> 01:29:04.217
<i>It's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you leave the case alone.</i>

1014
01:29:04.385 --> 01:29:06.094
<i>- Solve this.
- Are you, Holmes?</i>

1015
01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:08.289
<i>Accept that this was beyond your control.</i>

1016
01:29:08.389 --> 01:29:11.725
<i>- Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end.
- I've got a public in frenzy.</i>

1017
01:29:11.893 --> 01:29:13.226
<i>Holmes!</i>

1018
01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:35.916
<i>Widen your gaze.</i>

1019
01:29:36.084 --> 01:29:38.627
<i>You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.</i>

1020
01:29:38.795 --> 01:29:43.215
<i>You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.</i>

1021
01:29:43.382 --> 01:29:45.467
<i>Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.</i>

1022
01:29:45.635 --> 01:29:48.121
<i>He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the world.</i>

1023
01:29:48.221 --> 01:29:51.165
<i>- His power grows daily.
- This is the source of his power.</i>

1024
01:29:51.265 --> 01:29:52.265
<i>I need you.</i>

1025
01:29:52.433 --> 01:29:54.976
<i>His secret lies in the book of spells.</i>

1026
01:30:22.255 --> 01:30:25.048
<i>Three more will die...</i>

1027
01:30:25.675 --> 01:30:28.468
...and there is nothing you can do
to save them.

1028
01:30:29.137 --> 01:30:31.513
<i>We know you don't believe in magic.</i>

1029
01:30:32.682 --> 01:30:34.432
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

1030
01:30:34.559 --> 01:30:35.600
Is that better?

1031
01:30:35.768 --> 01:30:38.228
<i>He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.</i>

1032
01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.358
His eyes were wide open
and the only thing missing was his ring.

1033
01:30:50.449 --> 01:30:52.367
<i>Give up, Holmes.</i>

1034
01:30:54.662 --> 01:30:57.038
<i>This is a riddle you cannot solve.</i>

1035
01:31:03.337 --> 01:31:04.546
Good morning.

1036
01:31:08.134 --> 01:31:11.219
Now, you need to work.

1037
01:31:12.096 --> 01:31:13.346
Familiar artwork.

1038
01:31:16.475 --> 01:31:17.726
You look gorgeous.

1039
01:31:20.813 --> 01:31:23.190
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.

1040
01:31:31.073 --> 01:31:32.574
{\an8}You made the front page.

1041
01:31:32.992 --> 01:31:34.701
Only a name and no picture.

1042
01:31:36.078 --> 01:31:40.040
So it looks like you'll be needing to
work outside the law now...

1043
01:31:40.208 --> 01:31:42.250
...and that's my area of expertise.

1044
01:31:42.418 --> 01:31:44.377
I feel safer already.

1045
01:31:46.756 --> 01:31:48.965
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.

1046
01:31:50.259 --> 01:31:51.885
Yes.

1047
01:31:52.094 --> 01:31:54.596
Took the shrapnel out myself.

1048
01:31:54.764 --> 01:31:57.599
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1049
01:32:02.855 --> 01:32:04.356
Well, I'm...

1050
01:32:04.774 --> 01:32:06.316
...I'm just so...

1051
01:32:06.484 --> 01:32:08.068
...very glad that you're...

1052
01:32:08.236 --> 01:32:09.611
...well...

1053
01:32:10.071 --> 01:32:11.529
...with us.

1054
01:32:15.701 --> 01:32:20.038
Now that you're sitting comfortably,
I shall begin.

1055
01:32:20.539 --> 01:32:23.583
My initial approach was far too narrow.

1056
01:32:23.751 --> 01:32:26.211
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville Prison...

1057
01:32:26.379 --> 01:32:29.798
...he suggested I widen my gaze
and, at minimum, I have done just that.

1058
01:32:29.966 --> 01:32:34.970
In fact, I may well have reconciled
thousands of years of theological disparity.

1059
01:32:36.305 --> 01:32:38.640
But that's for another time.

1060
01:32:38.808 --> 01:32:41.977
Blackwood's method is based on
a ritualistic mystical system...

1061
01:32:42.144 --> 01:32:45.438
...that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.

1062
01:32:45.606 --> 01:32:48.692
To fully understand the system,
to get inside it...

1063
01:32:48.859 --> 01:32:52.404
...I reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt...

1064
01:32:52.571 --> 01:32:54.489
...with a few enhancements of my own.

1065
01:32:55.449 --> 01:32:59.494
My journey took me somewhat further down
the rabbit hole than I had intended...

1066
01:32:59.662 --> 01:33:04.165
...and though I dirtied my fluffy
white tail, I have emerged enlightened.

1067
01:33:05.459 --> 01:33:08.003
The fraternity who silently control
the empire...

1068
01:33:08.170 --> 01:33:11.339
...share the belief with the kings,
pharaohs and emperors of old...

1069
01:33:11.507 --> 01:33:14.301
...that the sphinx was a door
to another dimension...

1070
01:33:14.468 --> 01:33:16.553
...a gateway to immeasurable power.

1071
01:33:16.721 --> 01:33:20.473
It's made up of four parts:
The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...

1072
01:33:20.641 --> 01:33:23.018
...the wings of an eagle,
and the head of a man.

1073
01:33:23.811 --> 01:33:26.730
<i>In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...</i>

1074
01:33:26.897 --> 01:33:29.983
<i>...the tooth of a lion, the feather
of an eagle and hair of a man.</i>

1075
01:33:30.151 --> 01:33:31.526
Map.

1076
01:33:35.364 --> 01:33:38.199
The points of the star
represent the five murdered girls...

1077
01:33:38.367 --> 01:33:41.328
...but the cross
is what we're now interested in.

1078
01:33:41.579 --> 01:33:42.871
It's a widely held belief...

1079
01:33:43.039 --> 01:33:46.416
...that within the architecture
of the great cities...

1080
01:33:46.584 --> 01:33:49.336
...are coded references to this system.

1081
01:33:49.503 --> 01:33:52.505
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood has killed three men...

1082
01:33:52.673 --> 01:33:56.176
...each committed at a location
that has a connection with the temple...

1083
01:33:56.344 --> 01:33:57.719
...therefore the system.

1084
01:33:59.513 --> 01:34:01.723
<i>Reordan, the ginger midget,
represents man.</i>

1085
01:34:01.891 --> 01:34:03.892
We found his body here.

1086
01:34:04.518 --> 01:34:07.729
{\an8}Sir Thomas, master of the temple,
wore the ox ring.

1087
01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:10.231
He died here.

1088
01:34:11.067 --> 01:34:12.692
{\an8}Standish, ambassador to America...

1089
01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:15.987
{\an8}where the eagle has been
the national emblem for over 100 years.

1090
01:34:16.155 --> 01:34:20.241
The headquarters of the Temple
of the Four Orders where he died...

1091
01:34:20.409 --> 01:34:22.660
...is here.

1092
01:34:23.329 --> 01:34:26.664
Correspondingly, the map will tell us
the location of Blackwood's final act.

1093
01:34:26.832 --> 01:34:29.667
So we have man, the ox, eagle.

1094
01:34:30.586 --> 01:34:31.753
Only the lion remaining.

1095
01:34:31.921 --> 01:34:33.088
Right here.

1096
01:34:35.758 --> 01:34:36.925
Parliament.

1097
01:34:41.764 --> 01:34:43.223
Right.

1098
01:34:43.391 --> 01:34:46.935
You four stay here
and the rest of you come with me.

1099
01:34:47.103 --> 01:34:49.979
- Get out of the way, you lowlifes!
- Right this way.

1100
01:34:53.442 --> 01:34:55.276
Ladies first.

1101
01:34:55.444 --> 01:34:56.945
Now.

1102
01:34:57.905 --> 01:34:59.265
Follow these instructions.

1103
01:34:59.365 --> 01:35:00.907
- Aren't you...?
- Go.

1104
01:35:04.537 --> 01:35:06.704
Hello, hello, hello.

1105
01:35:07.331 --> 01:35:09.457
Did the devil turn up?

1106
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:12.085
Well...

1107
01:35:12.461 --> 01:35:14.129
...never mind.

1108
01:35:14.630 --> 01:35:16.297
You got the next best thing.

1109
01:35:39.655 --> 01:35:43.992
Beg your pardon, my Lord.
I know that it's unorthodox...

1110
01:35:45.161 --> 01:35:46.661
...but Mr. Holmes here...

1111
01:35:46.829 --> 01:35:50.498
...he's been making some
serious accusations about you...

1112
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:53.251
...and the order.

1113
01:35:55.296 --> 01:35:56.337
I see.

1114
01:35:56.505 --> 01:36:00.675
Well, at least that solves the great
mystery as to how you became inspector.

1115
01:36:06.015 --> 01:36:07.974
Excuse me, my Lord...

1116
01:36:08.517 --> 01:36:11.019
...but I've been wanting to do that
for a long time.

1117
01:36:11.187 --> 01:36:14.856
Well, inspector, I have five minutes
before my next engagement...

1118
01:36:15.483 --> 01:36:18.860
...so why don't you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy?

1119
01:36:21.947 --> 01:36:23.448
Thank you, Lestrade.

1120
01:36:23.949 --> 01:36:25.533
My Lord.

1121
01:36:31.373 --> 01:36:34.501
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...

1122
01:36:34.710 --> 01:36:36.669
...or just the one I prevented?

1123
01:36:37.838 --> 01:36:40.298
Very distinctive,
those handmade shoes of yours.

1124
01:36:42.718 --> 01:36:47.597
But the price of quality
is often the unique imprint they leave.

1125
01:36:48.557 --> 01:36:51.726
Nonetheless, I confess to being
completely outmatched.

1126
01:36:52.478 --> 01:36:55.188
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1127
01:36:56.565 --> 01:36:58.733
Fortunately,
there's nothing more stimulating...

1128
01:36:58.901 --> 01:37:01.236
...than a case where everything
goes against you.

1129
01:37:01.904 --> 01:37:05.406
How many members of Parliament
do you intend to murder at noon today?

1130
01:37:05.574 --> 01:37:07.200
Man, ox, eagle, lion.

1131
01:37:08.077 --> 01:37:09.661
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?

1132
01:37:12.748 --> 01:37:14.457
Very clever.

1133
01:37:14.875 --> 01:37:17.418
But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes.

1134
01:37:17.586 --> 01:37:19.254
It's mercy.

1135
01:37:19.421 --> 01:37:21.923
We are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd.

1136
01:37:22.091 --> 01:37:24.551
Don't you see that it's for their own...?

1137
01:37:27.346 --> 01:37:30.056
No, but I don't care much what you think.

1138
01:37:30.224 --> 01:37:33.101
I simply wanted to know the location
of Blackwood's ceremony...

1139
01:37:33.269 --> 01:37:34.686
...and you've given it to me.

1140
01:37:34.853 --> 01:37:36.062
I've told you nothing.

1141
01:37:36.647 --> 01:37:39.941
But your clothes say
infinitely more than you could ever hope.

1142
01:37:40.109 --> 01:37:42.276
<i>The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.</i>

1143
01:37:43.445 --> 01:37:46.781
<i>A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.</i>

1144
01:37:48.075 --> 01:37:51.286
<i>A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.</i>

1145
01:37:51.453 --> 01:37:55.456
<i>A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.</i>

1146
01:37:57.710 --> 01:38:00.461
You and Blackwood laid the final touches
to your ceremony...

1147
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:03.715
...in the sewers beneath Parliament
less than an hour ago.

1148
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.801
Both houses meet today.

1149
01:38:07.386 --> 01:38:09.387
The whole government will be present.

1150
01:38:18.772 --> 01:38:22.066
It's a shame you made an enemy
out of Blackwood, Holmes.

1151
01:38:22.776 --> 01:38:24.569
You would have made a valuable ally.

1152
01:38:31.994 --> 01:38:33.911
How terrible is wisdom...

1153
01:38:34.079 --> 01:38:36.956
...when it brings no profit to the wise.

1154
01:38:37.666 --> 01:38:39.167
We take power at noon.

1155
01:38:40.169 --> 01:38:42.503
There isn't any time to waste then,
is there?

1156
01:39:09.365 --> 01:39:11.616
I told you he'd be coming
out the top window.

1157
01:39:11.784 --> 01:39:14.285
There isn't any way
he'd be coming over that terrace.

1158
01:39:14.453 --> 01:39:17.288
Technically, that isn't the top window,
is it, sailor boy?

1159
01:39:17.456 --> 01:39:19.957
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.

1160
01:39:20.125 --> 01:39:21.292
Anyway.

1161
01:39:22.378 --> 01:39:24.962
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.

1162
01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:26.798
In fact, I think he enjoyed it.

1163
01:39:26.965 --> 01:39:28.675
I hope you know what you're doing.

1164
01:39:29.385 --> 01:39:31.052
Here's the key.

1165
01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:35.056
- You got all you needed from Coward?
- Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease.

1166
01:39:36.433 --> 01:39:37.475
- Tanner?
- Sir?

1167
01:39:37.643 --> 01:39:38.893
If you would, captain...

1168
01:39:39.061 --> 01:39:41.896
...take us under the bridge,
port side, 100 yards.

1169
01:39:42.064 --> 01:39:45.400
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel
that leads us to the sewers.

1170
01:39:45.567 --> 01:39:46.984
Right away, sir.

1171
01:39:53.742 --> 01:39:55.618
The end is nigh.

1172
01:39:55.786 --> 01:40:00.081
Blackwood's come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land.

1173
01:40:00.249 --> 01:40:03.876
He walks in every shadow
and every puff of smoke.

1174
01:40:04.044 --> 01:40:06.713
Behold, he cometh with clouds...

1175
01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.716
...and every eye shall see him...

1176
01:40:09.883 --> 01:40:13.469
...and every soul shall wail
because of him.

1177
01:40:13.637 --> 01:40:16.639
You cannot stop him!
No one can!

1178
01:40:46.670 --> 01:40:49.130
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.

1179
01:40:49.298 --> 01:40:52.090
- What does it do?
- It's a chemical weapon.

1180
01:40:52.426 --> 01:40:53.551
The first of its kind.

1181
01:40:53.719 --> 01:40:55.678
You deduced that how?

1182
01:40:55.846 --> 01:40:57.597
From my pocket.

1183
01:40:57.765 --> 01:41:00.767
I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat
at the slaughterhouse.

1184
01:41:00.934 --> 01:41:04.061
Note the blue discoloration,
the faint smell of bitter almonds.

1185
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:06.314
- Telltale traces of cyanide.
- Cyanide.

1186
01:41:11.111 --> 01:41:13.486
Now we know
what the ginger midget was working on.

1187
01:41:13.614 --> 01:41:15.490
It'll revolutionize warfare.

1188
01:41:15.657 --> 01:41:17.200
Yes, killing a lot of people.

1189
01:41:17.367 --> 01:41:19.994
Now, it's seven minutes to noon.
What are we gonna do?

1190
01:41:21.497 --> 01:41:23.247
Right. How many men
did you count on the...?

1191
01:41:26.752 --> 01:41:28.795
She loves an entrance, your muse.

1192
01:41:59.576 --> 01:42:00.868
Woman!

1193
01:42:01.995 --> 01:42:03.871
Shoot him. Now, please.

1194
01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:21.013
My lords.

1195
01:42:21.974 --> 01:42:23.224
The time has come...

1196
01:42:23.392 --> 01:42:25.726
...for only those who believe to remain.

1197
01:42:27.563 --> 01:42:28.855
Behold...

1198
01:42:29.022 --> 01:42:30.898
...Lord Blackwood.

1199
01:42:43.871 --> 01:42:45.538
You seem surprised.

1200
01:42:48.250 --> 01:42:51.669
I have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfill England's destiny...

1201
01:42:52.838 --> 01:42:56.591
...and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1202
01:42:59.261 --> 01:43:01.220
Listen to the rabble outside.

1203
01:43:01.889 --> 01:43:03.389
Listen...

1204
01:43:03.557 --> 01:43:04.932
...to the fear.

1205
01:43:05.559 --> 01:43:07.226
I will use that as a weapon...

1206
01:43:07.394 --> 01:43:09.312
...to control them...

1207
01:43:09.813 --> 01:43:11.063
...and then the world.

1208
01:43:15.444 --> 01:43:17.737
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.

1209
01:43:21.366 --> 01:43:24.368
Specifically designed
to prevent us from disarming it.

1210
01:43:27.039 --> 01:43:29.916
These appear to be designed
to receive a signal of some sort.

1211
01:43:30.083 --> 01:43:31.292
Electromagnetic waves?

1212
01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:33.127
<i>When triggered, the electrodes...</i>

1213
01:43:33.295 --> 01:43:35.880
<i>...will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas.</i>

1214
01:43:36.048 --> 01:43:39.926
<i>The gas will travel up that shaft and
filter through the ventilation system...</i>

1215
01:43:40.093 --> 01:43:42.720
<i>...that leads directly to Parliament.
Within seconds...</i>

1216
01:43:42.888 --> 01:43:45.973
<i>...the most powerful men in the world
will be choking on death.</i>

1217
01:43:46.141 --> 01:43:49.477
Blackwood must have some transmitter
that he can activate remotely.

1218
01:43:49.645 --> 01:43:51.479
Three minutes, 10 seconds.

1219
01:43:51.897 --> 01:43:55.983
I will create an empire
that will endure for millennia...

1220
01:43:56.610 --> 01:43:58.235
...indestructible...

1221
01:43:58.403 --> 01:43:59.654
...and eternal.

1222
01:44:00.238 --> 01:44:02.073
Move it. Move it.

1223
01:44:02.491 --> 01:44:04.992
We don't actually have to
disarm the device...

1224
01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:08.704
...we just have to remove the cylinders.

1225
01:44:08.872 --> 01:44:11.832
Yes, except that they're welded in.

1226
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.127
What we need is a controlled explosion.

1227
01:44:15.295 --> 01:44:18.881
We'll need a container to direct the blast.
My clay pipe should service that ambition.

1228
01:44:39.653 --> 01:44:42.279
I rather wish you hadn't done that,
Irene.

1229
01:44:48.578 --> 01:44:53.582
On the 12th chime,
I will summon the dark powers.

1230
01:44:54.167 --> 01:44:58.504
All those of you who are with me
shall be protected.

1231
01:44:58.672 --> 01:44:59.714
All others...

1232
01:44:59.881 --> 01:45:01.215
...will perish.

1233
01:45:08.473 --> 01:45:10.141
I need your pipe.

1234
01:45:13.812 --> 01:45:15.229
Nut him!

1235
01:45:40.505 --> 01:45:41.922
- Right.
- What?

1236
01:45:42.090 --> 01:45:43.758
- Coat.
- Got it.

1237
01:46:21.963 --> 01:46:23.255
The new order...

1238
01:46:24.716 --> 01:46:25.800
...begins now.

1239
01:46:31.973 --> 01:46:32.973
Woman.

1240
01:46:33.809 --> 01:46:35.434
What are you waiting for?

1241
01:46:38.313 --> 01:46:39.522
That.

1242
01:46:50.826 --> 01:46:52.493
Apprehend Lord Coward.

1243
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:56.956
- Can you manage?
- Course I can.

1244
01:47:23.984 --> 01:47:25.401
Relax...

1245
01:47:25.569 --> 01:47:26.610
...I'm a doctor.

1246
01:48:38.767 --> 01:48:41.185
Did you take a wrong turning
somewhere?

1247
01:48:43.229 --> 01:48:44.438
We're safe now.

1248
01:48:45.482 --> 01:48:46.774
Interesting assessment.

1249
01:48:49.319 --> 01:48:50.986
Run off.

1250
01:48:53.239 --> 01:48:55.032
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1251
01:48:56.618 --> 01:48:58.452
Fare thee well.

1252
01:49:03.625 --> 01:49:05.626
I don't want to run anymore.

1253
01:49:08.505 --> 01:49:10.965
- I'll tell you everything.
- I wish you would.

1254
01:49:35.156 --> 01:49:36.323
No!

1255
01:50:42.182 --> 01:50:43.640
There was never any magic.

1256
01:50:45.894 --> 01:50:47.394
Only conjuring tricks.

1257
01:50:52.025 --> 01:50:54.026
The simplest involved
paying people off...

1258
01:50:54.194 --> 01:50:57.446
<i>...like the guard who pretended
to be possessed outside your cell.</i>

1259
01:50:57.614 --> 01:51:00.157
Your reputation
and the inmates' fear did the rest.

1260
01:51:01.743 --> 01:51:04.244
Others required
more elaborate preparations...

1261
01:51:04.412 --> 01:51:07.706
...like the sandstone slab
that covered your tomb.

1262
01:51:08.666 --> 01:51:12.628
You had it broken before your burial,
then put back together using an adhesive.

1263
01:51:13.963 --> 01:51:16.423
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe...

1264
01:51:16.591 --> 01:51:18.675
<i>...a mixture of egg and honey...</i>

1265
01:51:19.344 --> 01:51:21.595
...designed to be washed away
by the rain.

1266
01:51:26.601 --> 01:51:27.935
Holmes!

1267
01:51:28.103 --> 01:51:30.854
Arranging for your father
to drown in his own bathtub...

1268
01:51:31.022 --> 01:51:32.856
<i>...required more modern science.</i>

1269
01:51:33.024 --> 01:51:35.943
Very clever of Reordan
to find a paralytic...

1270
01:51:36.111 --> 01:51:39.113
...that was activated by the combination
of copper and water...

1271
01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.616
...and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1272
01:51:43.451 --> 01:51:45.452
That might've been a challenge for me...

1273
01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:49.206
had he not also tested it
on some unfortunate amphibians.

1274
01:51:53.878 --> 01:51:56.964
The death of Standish
was a real mystery...

1275
01:51:57.132 --> 01:52:00.217
...until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

1276
01:52:01.553 --> 01:52:03.971
<i>An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...</i>

1277
01:52:04.597 --> 01:52:06.723
...yet it burned
with an unusual pinkish hue.

1278
01:52:08.810 --> 01:52:12.146
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

1279
01:52:13.314 --> 01:52:14.773
All it took was a spark.

1280
01:52:19.237 --> 01:52:21.446
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.

1281
01:52:22.907 --> 01:52:24.324
<i>Ingenious.</i>

1282
01:52:24.492 --> 01:52:27.953
Like all great performers, you saved
your pièce de résistance for the end:

1283
01:52:28.121 --> 01:52:32.916
<i>A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine.</i>

1284
01:52:33.084 --> 01:52:34.626
Had it worked...

1285
01:52:34.794 --> 01:52:37.671
...your followers in Parliament
would have watched unharmed...

1286
01:52:37.839 --> 01:52:40.340
...as their colleagues
were dying around them.

1287
01:52:40.508 --> 01:52:42.509
They didn't know
you'd given them the antidote.

1288
01:52:42.677 --> 01:52:45.095
<i>Instead, they would've
believed it was magic...</i>

1289
01:52:45.263 --> 01:52:47.973
<i>...and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.</i>

1290
01:52:48.308 --> 01:52:52.019
And the world would've followed,
fear being the most powerful weapon of all.

1291
01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:56.857
You'd better hope
that it's nothing more than superstition...

1292
01:52:57.025 --> 01:52:59.193
...as you performed
all the rituals perfectly.

1293
01:53:00.028 --> 01:53:01.987
<i>The devil is due a soul, I'd say.</i>

1294
01:53:04.282 --> 01:53:06.366
For God's sake, Holmes, cut me loose.

1295
01:53:17.170 --> 01:53:20.797
First, the world will see you
for what you are. A fraud.

1296
01:53:22.383 --> 01:53:23.717
Then you'll be hanged.

1297
01:53:23.885 --> 01:53:25.719
Properly, this time.

1298
01:53:25.887 --> 01:53:28.013
It's a long journey from here to the rope.

1299
01:54:19.357 --> 01:54:22.276
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.

1300
01:54:23.278 --> 01:54:24.820
I have.

1301
01:54:26.114 --> 01:54:27.698
Naked.

1302
01:54:31.661 --> 01:54:33.787
Storm's coming.

1303
01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:37.624
Well, we've still got a moment.

1304
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:42.879
Moriarty.

1305
01:54:43.047 --> 01:54:44.464
What?

1306
01:54:44.632 --> 01:54:46.633
That's his name.

1307
01:54:47.218 --> 01:54:49.386
And he is a professor.

1308
01:54:51.514 --> 01:54:53.598
Everyone has a weak spot...

1309
01:54:54.017 --> 01:54:56.268
...and he found mine.

1310
01:54:57.687 --> 01:54:59.646
Where was it, precisely?

1311
01:55:10.533 --> 01:55:13.660
Please don't underestimate him.

1312
01:55:13.828 --> 01:55:16.204
He's just as brilliant as you are...

1313
01:55:16.372 --> 01:55:18.623
...and infinitely more devious.

1314
01:55:18.791 --> 01:55:21.001
We'll see about that.

1315
01:55:37.477 --> 01:55:39.853
You'll miss me, Sherlock.

1316
01:55:41.856 --> 01:55:43.523
Sadly...

1317
01:55:44.150 --> 01:55:45.817
...yes.

1318
01:56:11.177 --> 01:56:13.011
Just keep it under your hat.

1319
01:56:13.179 --> 01:56:16.098
Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.

1320
01:56:16.265 --> 01:56:18.225
- Thank you.
- What's in these, John?

1321
01:56:18.393 --> 01:56:19.393
Scribbles.

1322
01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:21.061
- Scribbles?
- Notes.

1323
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:23.897
They're your adventures.
I'd like to read them.

1324
01:56:30.738 --> 01:56:32.072
Come on, what's wrong?

1325
01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:34.783
Do you think he's come to terms
with you leaving?

1326
01:56:34.951 --> 01:56:38.328
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.

1327
01:56:38.955 --> 01:56:41.248
Now, five minutes here
and we'll go home.

1328
01:56:41.416 --> 01:56:42.791
Our home.

1329
01:56:42.959 --> 01:56:44.626
Get up those stairs.

1330
01:56:52.552 --> 01:56:54.094
Don't worry, dear.

1331
01:56:54.262 --> 01:56:56.346
Suicide is not in his repertoire.

1332
01:56:56.514 --> 01:56:58.807
He's far too fond of himself for that.

1333
01:56:59.434 --> 01:57:01.101
Holmes.

1334
01:57:03.128 --> 01:57:04.755
Good afternoon.

1335
01:57:05.022 --> 01:57:09.109
I was trying to deduce the manner
in which Blackwood survived his execution.

1336
01:57:09.277 --> 01:57:11.361
Clearing your good name, as it were.

1337
01:57:11.696 --> 01:57:14.239
But it had a surprisingly
soporific effect...

1338
01:57:14.407 --> 01:57:18.118
...and I was carried off in the arms
of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.

1339
01:57:18.286 --> 01:57:19.619
Good afternoon, dear.

1340
01:57:19.787 --> 01:57:21.455
Get on with it, Holmes.

1341
01:57:21.622 --> 01:57:25.292
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot
was a hook.

1342
01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:28.462
Oh, dear, my legs have fallen asleep.
I should come down.

1343
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:30.213
John, shouldn't we help him down?

1344
01:57:30.381 --> 01:57:32.799
No, no, no,
I hate to cut him off midstream.

1345
01:57:32.967 --> 01:57:34.134
Carry on.

1346
01:57:35.178 --> 01:57:37.846
Well, the executioner
attached it to a harness...

1347
01:57:38.014 --> 01:57:40.807
<i>...allowing the weight to be
distributed around the waist...</i>

1348
01:57:40.975 --> 01:57:43.018
...and the neck to remain intact.

1349
01:57:43.186 --> 01:57:46.646
My Lord, I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?

1350
01:57:46.814 --> 01:57:48.440
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1351
01:57:49.066 --> 01:57:52.277
I managed it with braces,
belts and a coat hook.

1352
01:57:53.237 --> 01:57:56.114
Please, my tongue is going,
I'll be of no use to you at all.

1353
01:57:56.282 --> 01:57:57.991
- Worse things could happen.
- John.

1354
01:58:00.828 --> 01:58:03.955
Yet none of this explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.

1355
01:58:04.123 --> 01:58:05.499
Right.

1356
01:58:05.666 --> 01:58:10.962
<i>Now, the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.</i>

1357
01:58:11.130 --> 01:58:14.758
There is a toxin refined from the nectar
of the <i>rhododendron ponticum.</i>

1358
01:58:14.926 --> 01:58:18.011
<i>It's infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...</i>

1359
01:58:18.179 --> 01:58:21.681
...for its ability to induce
an apparently mortal paralysis.

1360
01:58:21.849 --> 01:58:25.268
Enough to mislead a medical mind
even as well-trained as your own.

1361
01:58:25.436 --> 01:58:27.771
- It's known as...
- What's wrong with Gladstone?

1362
01:58:27.939 --> 01:58:29.814
...mad honey disease.

1363
01:58:29.982 --> 01:58:33.777
Oh, he's demonstrating
the very effect I've just described.

1364
01:58:34.153 --> 01:58:35.487
He doesn't mind.

1365
01:58:38.032 --> 01:58:40.450
Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse.

1366
01:58:41.077 --> 01:58:42.452
Mr. Holmes?

1367
01:58:44.747 --> 01:58:45.997
Doctor. Miss Mary.

1368
01:58:46.707 --> 01:58:49.834
Sir, lnspector Lestrade asks that
you come with me right away.

1369
01:58:50.378 --> 01:58:53.713
- What is it is this time, Clarkie?
- It's one of our sergeants, sir.

1370
01:58:53.881 --> 01:58:56.466
He went missing
the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.

1371
01:58:56.634 --> 01:59:00.220
<i>I'm afraid sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.</i>

1372
01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:03.723
We believe the sergeant
was our first man on the scene.

1373
01:59:03.891 --> 01:59:05.684
Can I help you, officer?

1374
01:59:06.435 --> 01:59:07.477
Shot in the head.

1375
01:59:09.146 --> 01:59:10.897
Was it a small caliber bullet?

1376
01:59:12.024 --> 01:59:13.358
Yes.

1377
01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:17.112
Were there powder burns
on his eyebrows?

1378
01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:18.947
Indeed, sir.

1379
01:59:21.075 --> 01:59:22.409
Point blank range?

1380
01:59:22.577 --> 01:59:23.827
Moriarty.

1381
01:59:25.246 --> 01:59:27.414
Professor Moriarty.

1382
01:59:29.959 --> 01:59:31.918
Oh, there's a good boy.

1383
01:59:32.086 --> 01:59:33.670
Everything's gonna be fine.

1384
01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:36.548
Where is Blackwood's device now?

1385
01:59:36.716 --> 01:59:39.759
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.

1386
01:59:40.261 --> 01:59:42.470
I'd wager there's a piece missing.

1387
01:59:44.432 --> 01:59:47.475
So Moriarty was after
a piece of the machine...

1388
01:59:48.102 --> 01:59:49.352
...not the poison.

1389
01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:51.938
There's nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1390
01:59:52.106 --> 01:59:54.566
<i>The wire-free invention
was the game all along.</i>

1391
01:59:54.734 --> 01:59:57.193
And Adler was just the diversion.

1392
01:59:57.361 --> 01:59:59.988
<i>He knew I'd chase her,
leaving the machine accessible.</i>

1393
02:00:00.156 --> 02:00:04.034
<i>A technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.</i>

1394
02:00:04.201 --> 02:00:06.494
Imagine being able
to control any device...

1395
02:00:06.662 --> 02:00:10.332
...simply by sending a command
via radio waves.

1396
02:00:11.125 --> 02:00:13.126
It's the future, Watson.

1397
02:00:15.421 --> 02:00:17.881
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.

1398
02:00:21.218 --> 02:00:22.802
- Well...
- Well...

1399
02:00:24.138 --> 02:00:27.015
- Gladstone.
- Stop him before he gets to the front door.

1400
02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.017
Clarkie.

1401
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:33.104
Case reopened.

1402
02:08:22.282 --> 02:08:24.283
English
