1
00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:02.195
Oh, hello, there!

2
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.498
Didn't see you
creeping up
behind me.

3
00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.836
Welcome. Come on,
come in here
and listen

4
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.506
to this wonderful tale of woe.

5
00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.474
Not woe as in,
"Ah, bummer, man!"

6
00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.645
But woe as in,
"Whoa! That's amazing!

7
00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.247
"I can't believe
that pretty much
actually happened!

8
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.583
"With a couple
of embellishments

9
00:01:21.616 --> 00:01:23.051
"along the way."

10
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.086
<i>Our tale is a tale</i>
<i>of two islands.</i>

11
00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.322
<i>One is</i>
<i>a teeny-weeny</i>
<i>beautiful,</i>

12
00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.792
<i>little tropical island</i>
<i>in the Pacific Ocean</i>

13
00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:32.794
<i>called American Samoa.</i>

14
00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:36.064
<i>Home to a wonderful people,</i>
<i>who are deeply religious,</i>

15
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:40.334
<i>hardworking</i>
<i>and deeply religious.</i>

16
00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.303
<i>But the other island,</i>
<i>that was a man.</i>

17
00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:45.873
<i>The Palagi white man!</i>

18
00:01:45.907 --> 00:01:47.942
And just like
any incredible story,

19
00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:52.580
our tale begins
with utter humiliation.

20
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:55.717
<i>- Well, here they come.</i>
<i>- American Samoa.</i>

21
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.219
<i>A bit of smiling going on,</i>
<i>but some apprehension as well.</i>

22
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.824
<i>Well, that's the first one.</i>

23
00:02:05.627 --> 00:02:08.062
<i>Goal! It's three.</i>

24
00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:11.766
<i>They scored again.</i>
<i>Five for the Socceroos.</i>

25
00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.302
<i>Goodness me. Humiliation.</i>
<i>Boys against men.</i>

26
00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:18.806
<i>Oh dear, oh dear.</i>
<i>Hard to keep count.</i>

27
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:21.576
<i>It's getting embarrassing.</i>

28
00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.911
<i>Goal. Goal. Goal.</i>

29
00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.247
<i>Just too easy. Goal.</i>

30
00:02:30.752 --> 00:02:33.054
<i>Thirty-one.</i>
<i>American Samoa</i>

31
00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:35.288
<i>on the wrong end</i>
<i>of the biggest</i>

32
00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:37.925
<i>World Cup hammering ever.</i>

33
00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.970
<i>And 10 years later,</i>
<i>they were just as bad.</i>

34
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:52.006
<i>In fact, I think they had</i>
<i>actually gotten worse.</i>

35
00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:56.443
Come on!

36
00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:03.985
American Samoa!

37
00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:28.776
- Samoa!
- Samoa!

38
00:03:32.947 --> 00:03:34.347
You guys suck!

39
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.984
Oh, we're going to lose.

40
00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.829
- Okay, we can do it.
- Come on.

41
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.031
We're going already!

42
00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:52.734
- What are you doing?
<i>- Goal!</i>

43
00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:54.569
Oh, my gloves
weren't even on yet.

44
00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:56.104
Pisa, put your gloves on.
I'm not even ready!

45
00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:57.171
Come on!

46
00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:02.076
Help, help, help!

47
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.310
<i>Goal!</i>

48
00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:06.279
Move out.
Move out.

49
00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:10.818
<i>Goal!</i>

50
00:04:10.852 --> 00:04:13.054
<i>Goal!</i>

51
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.291
That was
a terrible first half.

52
00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:20.528
And now I'm forced
to give you a growling.

53
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:22.395
Are you ready
for the growling?
Hmm?

54
00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.833
Yes.
Okay,
you asked for it.

55
00:04:25.867 --> 00:04:26.934
Get ready.

56
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:31.072
You were bad.
You are bad.

57
00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:32.540
That was bad.

58
00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:35.408
Where's the heart?
Where's the spirit?

59
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.146
You have to play
with heart and spirit.

60
00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:40.114
You're bad. Bad!

61
00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:41.816
Okay, Ace,
I'll take over from here.

62
00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.684
Yeah, I think
that's best,
yeah.

63
00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:47.320
Okay, gentlemen,
listen up.

64
00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:49.456
In case you don't know me,
I'm Tavita Taumua.

65
00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.793
I'm the President
of the Football Federation

66
00:04:51.826 --> 00:04:53.360
of American Samoa.

67
00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.362
But I think you all
do know me.

68
00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:57.297
Hi, son.
Hey, Dad.

69
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.699
I'm here
to beg something

70
00:04:58.733 --> 00:04:59.934
from you
for the second half.

71
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:03.871
I know we've never ever
scored a goal, ever!

72
00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:06.207
But we have to
because I've made a bet

73
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.975
with the heads
of the football federations

74
00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.110
from the other islands

75
00:05:09.143 --> 00:05:10.678
that we could.

76
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:11.913
And if we don't,

77
00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:15.516
they're going to draw
a lady boobs on my face.

78
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.119
That's some
pretty powerful motivation.

79
00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:19.452
<i>Both teams,</i>

80
00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:22.355
<i>please return to the field.</i>
Okay! 45 minutes left!

81
00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.592
Let's go,
American Samoa!

82
00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:32.900
One heart!

83
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.508
Hey, guys, heads up.

84
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:41.976
Not all of the goals went in.

85
00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.645
So, that's heart and spirit.
Right, Tavita?

86
00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:49.717
Ace, you're a lovely guy,
but you're a terrible coach.

87
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.018
You're sacked.

88
00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:53.588
Okay, cool.
That seems fair.

89
00:05:54.155 --> 00:05:56.324
Yeah, take a look.

90
00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.059
Count the boobs.

91
00:05:58.092 --> 00:05:59.126
Count them.

92
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.394
Individual boobs
or pairs?

93
00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:04.699
I'll save you the trouble.
There's 11 pairs.

94
00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:06.234
Eleven pairs.

95
00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:09.070
They drew these
with permanent marker.

96
00:06:09.103 --> 00:06:10.838
You know
what permanent means?

97
00:06:10.872 --> 00:06:12.039
Forever!

98
00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:13.708
Aren't you guys sick
of losing?

99
00:06:13.741 --> 00:06:15.743
We haven't scored one goal
in the history

100
00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:18.445
of our country trying
to have a soccer team.

101
00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.681
Doesn't that
strike you as odd?

102
00:06:21.082 --> 00:06:22.917
Mark my words,

103
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.087
things are going
to change.

104
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.688
I'm going to get us
a new coach.

105
00:06:27.722 --> 00:06:29.156
Huh?

106
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.390
New coach.

107
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.163
Where am I going
to find a new coach?

108
00:06:36.197 --> 00:06:38.032
You have to look
off island.

109
00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:39.367
No, that's treason.

110
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.902
Treason is sending
that poor team

111
00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:42.870
to play games they have
no hope of winning.

112
00:06:42.904 --> 00:06:46.207
You have to think
outside the box.

113
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.309
Hmm, well,
sometimes the box

114
00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:50.578
is too small
to think inside of.

115
00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:51.646
Maybe I will do it.

116
00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:52.813
I've already done it.

117
00:06:52.847 --> 00:06:55.549
I've rung the American
Football Federation

118
00:06:55.583 --> 00:06:57.051
to put an ad up
for the job.

119
00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:59.787
Dad, we don't need
some Palagi with
his white savior complex

120
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.355
to come teach us
how to play soccer.

121
00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:02.790
Daru!

122
00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:04.325
But there's so many
other great coaches
on the island.

123
00:07:04.358 --> 00:07:05.993
Like who?
Like Ace.

124
00:07:06.027 --> 00:07:06.961
I sacked him.

125
00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:09.130
He's no good
with pressure.
He hates pressure.

126
00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:11.065
You hate pressure,
don't you, Ace?

127
00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:13.234
Yeah, that's true.
I hate it.

128
00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:15.403
There's only four weeks
to the World Cup
qualifier, Dad.

129
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.571
We should
just get a coach
from the island.

130
00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:18.773
Don't make me

131
00:07:18.806 --> 00:07:20.942
hit you with this sandal.

132
00:07:20.975 --> 00:07:24.245
We are getting
a real coach.
That's it!

133
00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:25.746
And don't think
I haven't noticed

134
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.515
those big boobs
on your face.

135
00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:28.816
Whose boobs are those?

136
00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:30.450
I don't know,
they're drawings.

137
00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:32.253
Drawings of boobs
are a gateway

138
00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:33.486
to the real thing.

139
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:35.189
Be careful,
my mister.

140
00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:40.161
Look,
I know this season

141
00:07:40.194 --> 00:07:42.730
didn't go as planned.

142
00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.532
It's known
as the beautiful game,

143
00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:47.601
but let's face it,
it's a complicated game, guys.

144
00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:50.738
Football, soccer,
as you like to call it,

145
00:07:51.672 --> 00:07:54.175
is like life. You know?

146
00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:58.112
You're riding high in April
and shot down in May.

147
00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:01.782
Um, next season, I think,
we have a real shot.

148
00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:04.385
As long as you, uh,
trust me and allow me

149
00:08:04.418 --> 00:08:07.088
to play the system
that I like to play.

150
00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:11.525
Uh, I'm sorry,
uh, Thomas,
did nobody tell you?

151
00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:15.363
You're...
You're fired.

152
00:08:15.396 --> 00:08:16.731
Did honestly
nobody tell you?

153
00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:18.099
- Rhys, did you not...
- Yeah, of course, I...

154
00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:21.035
I'm fired?
Are you joking?
Are you kidding me?

155
00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:24.005
Obviously,
you're in shock,
which is understandable.

156
00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:25.773
And it is only natural
that you go through

157
00:08:25.806 --> 00:08:27.541
the five stages
of grief,

158
00:08:27.575 --> 00:08:28.909
which Rhys, I think,
you have a...

159
00:08:28.943 --> 00:08:32.580
Yes. Thank you, Alex.
We'll just quickly run this...

160
00:08:32.613 --> 00:08:36.450
Thank you, Chris.
There we go. Yep,
too far. Release it.

161
00:08:36.484 --> 00:08:38.419
Now, to...
You've lost it.

162
00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:41.622
Settle it there.
Just, yep,
there we go.

163
00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:44.959
Thanks, Chris.
Spin it round.

164
00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:47.561
No, you got
to flip it.
Flip the...

165
00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:50.031
Yep, there we go.
And spin it round.

166
00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:54.402
Stage one, denial.

167
00:08:54.435 --> 00:08:55.636
This is not happening.

168
00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:57.671
There it is. That's it,
that's classic denial.

169
00:08:57.705 --> 00:09:00.608
Good news is,
you got two options. Rhys?

170
00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:04.111
Option one, that's where
you're currently at.

171
00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:06.047
- Or...
- Chris?

172
00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:10.818
Pacific Ocean?

173
00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:14.755
Uh, well, yes. Uh, but, no.
Specifically, American Samoa.

174
00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:16.390
American Samoa?

175
00:09:16.424 --> 00:09:18.893
Are you serious?
Is this a joke?

176
00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:20.127
Gail, do you know
about this?

177
00:09:20.728 --> 00:09:23.464
Yes, it was my idea.

178
00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:25.132
Can't believe
you'd do this to me!

179
00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:29.403
I deserve some respect.
Oh, boy.

180
00:09:29.437 --> 00:09:30.905
I'm the only one
in this room

181
00:09:30.938 --> 00:09:32.873
that knows anything
about this game.

182
00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:36.545
Stage two. Anger.

183
00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:37.678
That anger
is real.

184
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.346
Was he this angry
when you were married?

185
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.615
He was calmer before.

186
00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:43.484
Thomas, you need to stop
thinking about this

187
00:09:43.518 --> 00:09:44.652
as some kind of punishment.

188
00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:47.254
This could be
a chance to heal.

189
00:09:48.189 --> 00:09:49.790
Maybe find
a new direction.

190
00:09:50.324 --> 00:09:51.725
Oh, Gail!

191
00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:54.128
God, I love that, Gail.
That is so good.
Excellent.

192
00:09:54.161 --> 00:09:57.098
I played this game
at the top level.

193
00:09:57.731 --> 00:09:59.467
This isn't fair.

194
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.701
Fair?

195
00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.369
You want to know
about fair?

196
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:03.971
Oh, here we go.

197
00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:05.339
Let me tell you
a story, buddy.

198
00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:08.142
When I was a kid,
I had this dog.

199
00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:10.377
And I loved this dog.

200
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:11.612
But then,
he got older.

201
00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:13.380
And I guess he had
some anger issues.

202
00:10:13.414 --> 00:10:14.882
Wasn't the same dog.

203
00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:17.251
My dad said that we needed
to put the dog down.

204
00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:18.319
So, we take him outside,

205
00:10:18.352 --> 00:10:19.887
and this dog,
he is whimpering.

206
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.790
We're taking him out.
"Oh, no,
this isn't fair.

207
00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:25.025
"Remember how good
I was in the past?"

208
00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:28.696
And my dad made me
take that dog outside

209
00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:31.432
and drown him
in the pond.

210
00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:33.067
I'm the dog
in this story?

211
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.969
No, of course not.
I'm just telling you
the story

212
00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:36.170
about my dog
when I was growing up.

213
00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:38.372
And the fact that my dad
was a bit of an asshole.

214
00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:40.841
Okay, look.

215
00:10:41.342 --> 00:10:42.511
I can change.

216
00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:43.677
I'm flexible, guys.

217
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:45.846
Let's not make
any rash decisions here.

218
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.748
Really,
really good stuff, Thomas.

219
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:49.049
You are smoking
through these.

220
00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:50.885
- There's only two left.
- Oh, that's great.

221
00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:52.753
'Cause I got to...

222
00:10:53.254 --> 00:10:55.689
Wow.
Chris?

223
00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:57.691
We only got
one left.

224
00:10:57.725 --> 00:10:59.960
And it's
my favorite one
of all.

225
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.786
Mr. Rongen? Mr. Rongen,
hello, Mr. Rongen.

226
00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:00.421
<i>Welcome to American Samoa.</i>

227
00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:01.690
<i>What is this shit?</i>

228
00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:03.757
No naughty words,

<i>This is</i>

00:12:08.062 --> 00:12:11.031
We interview people
who travel to the island

232
00:12:11.065 --> 00:12:13.801
<i>Well, I guess what everyone</i>
<i>at home wants to know is</i>

233
00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:16.036
<i>why have you come</i>
<i>halfway across the world</i>

234
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.405

235
00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:24.111
<i>I have a very particular</i>

236
00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:26.981
<i>Skills I've acquired</i>
<i>over a very long career.</i>

237
00:12:27.014 --> 00:12:29.316
<i>Skills that make me</i>
<i>a nightmare</i>

238
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.018

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.796

<i>Because I perform</i>

245
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.004
Okay, well,
one thing's for sure.

246
00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:52.973
The new coach
is very friendly
and outgoing.

247
00:12:53.007 --> 00:12:54.908
<i>We'll see you next time</i>

250
00:12:59.013 --> 00:13:01.415
It's very nice
to meet you.

251
00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:03.050
I am Tavita,
I'm the President

of the Football Federation
of American Samoa.

253
00:13:05.553 --> 00:13:08.255
And also the cameraman
for <i>Who's On The Plane?</i>

254
00:13:08.289 --> 00:13:10.725
It's a small island.
We all have lots of jobs.

255
00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:12.126
Now, as an honored guest,

256
00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:13.728
we have a very
special surprise

257
00:13:13.762 --> 00:13:15.129
waiting outside.
Okay?

258
00:13:15.162 --> 00:13:16.930
So, Gus will look
after you.

259
00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:18.332
Yeah, you'll love this.

260
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.069
This is so exciting!
Guys! Guys!

261
00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:23.638
Dad, why
are we here?

262
00:13:23.672 --> 00:13:26.775
It's all part of
my exciting
master surprise plan.

263
00:13:26.807 --> 00:13:29.877
Gentlemen, I am proud
to officially announce

264
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.780
our new official
national coach

265
00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:33.847
of the American Samoa
soccer team.

266
00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:39.788
He's played with some of
the top players
in the world.

267
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.954
Oh.

268
00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:44.458
And, he's originally
from Europe.

269
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:45.826
Oh.

270
00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:50.431
So, let's give him a warm
American Samoan welcome!

271
00:13:50.464 --> 00:13:52.534
Um, okay, guys, hey...

272
00:14:09.818 --> 00:14:11.820
Your chariot awaits.

273
00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:19.059
Okay, okay.

274
00:14:20.427 --> 00:14:21.663
Yeah, great stuff, guys.

275
00:14:21.696 --> 00:14:23.130
I think he feels
really welcome.

276
00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:24.666
We'll see you
at training.

277
00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:25.800
Hey. Dad,

278
00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:27.669
how many offshore people
applied for the job?

279
00:14:27.702 --> 00:14:29.504
Oh, the response
was incredible!

280
00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:30.971
Yeah? How many
people responded?

281
00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:32.841
Well,
there was him.

282
00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:34.141
Yeah, it was just him.

283
00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:36.377
But the fact
that he responded,

284
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.011
absolutely incredible.

285
00:14:38.045 --> 00:14:39.113
I really think things

286
00:14:39.146 --> 00:14:40.981
are gonna turn around.
You know, son?

287
00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:42.717
It's like
in <i>The Matrix.</i>

288
00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:46.019
I think this man
is the Neo.

289
00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:54.128
<i>Welcome</i>
<i>to American Samoa.</i>

290
00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:58.232
<i>With a population</i>
<i>of</i> 57,534 <i>people,</i>

291

<i>American Samoa is</i>
<i>a United States territory</i>

292
00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:05.072
<i>like Puerto Rico, but much</i>
<i>smaller and further away.</i>

293
00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:09.176
<i>The two main exports</i>
<i>are NFL players and tuna.</i>

294
00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:10.444
<i>It should not be confused</i>

295
00:15:10.477 --> 00:15:12.980
<i>with the independent nation</i>
<i>of Samoa</i>

296
00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:15.249
<i>with their cocky,</i>
<i>stuck-up people</i>

297
00:15:15.282 --> 00:15:18.352
<i>always bragging about</i>
<i>their 24-hour McDonald's.</i>

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.220
<i>Even though</i>
<i>we are both Samoan...</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

299
00:15:20.254 --> 00:15:21.790
<i>...there are two Samoas.</i>

300
00:15:21.823 --> 00:15:23.190
Can you drive faster?

301
00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:25.325
<i>Oh, I would never break</i>
<i>the speed limit.</i>

302
00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:28.162
<i>It's 20 miles per hour</i>
<i>across the whole island.</i>

303
00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:29.898
<i>Interesting fact.</i>
<i>The bird</i>

304
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.299
<i>on the flag</i>

Welcome to your
new accommodation.

306
00:15:37.605 --> 00:15:39.306
Oh, that's your car,

307
00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:42.142
so you can move
around the island
at will.

308
00:15:43.545 --> 00:15:44.378
Mmm-hmm.

309
00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:47.948
And now,
the <i>piece de residence.</i>

310
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.422
Your castle awaits.

311
00:15:56.758 --> 00:15:58.158
Your landlord
is Sione.

312
00:15:58.192 --> 00:15:59.761
He lives in the house
next door.

313
00:15:59.794 --> 00:16:01.729
And he is available
seven-twenty-four

314
00:16:01.763 --> 00:16:03.598
to address
your every need.

315
00:16:03.631 --> 00:16:05.065
Seven-twenty-four?

316
00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:07.000
Seven days out
of every twenty-four.

317
00:16:08.903 --> 00:16:10.304
Well, I'll let you
get settled in.

318
00:16:10.337 --> 00:16:13.307
And I will leave this
<i>Welcome to American Samoa</i>
video here

319
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.844
for you to peruse
at your leisure.

320
00:16:15.877 --> 00:16:19.046
The qualifiers are
only four weeks away,
Mr. Rongen.

321
00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:22.550
All I want from our team
is just one goal.

322
00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:24.117
One goal.

323
00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:29.122
One goal.

324
00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:52.580
Hello?

325
00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:57.719
Hello? Can I use
the phone?

326
00:17:19.974 --> 00:17:21.208
<i>Rongen won the MLS</i>

327
00:17:21.241 --> 00:17:22.476
<i>Coach of the Year award</i>

328
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.879
<i>and coached the US men's</i>
<i>national team.</i>

329
00:17:24.913 --> 00:17:26.881
<i>But his career</i>
<i>went mysteriously</i>

330
00:17:26.915 --> 00:17:28.616
<i>off the rails two years ago.</i>

331
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.385
<i>And I think the question</i>
<i>we're all wondering is...</i>

332
00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:33.655
<i>Why have you come halfway</i>
<i>across the world</i>

333
00:17:33.688 --> 00:17:36.691
<i>to coach</i>
<i>the worst soccer team</i>
<i>in the world?</i>

334
00:17:40.695 --> 00:17:41.696
<i>Coach Rongen has</i>

<i>a colorful reputation.</i>
<i>What, what, what, what?</i>

336
00:17:44.566 --> 00:17:46.534
<i>But the team is hopeful</i>
<i>he can save them</i>

337
00:17:46.568 --> 00:17:49.771
<i>from another</i>
<i>international humiliation.</i>

dreamcatcher outlet.

347
00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:11.693
You guys have
a public phone
that I could use?

348
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:14.161
Hello?

349
00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:15.697
Excuse me?

350
00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.297
Hello?

351
00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:22.537
What the...

352
00:18:38.086 --> 00:18:39.453
Now, we gonna do
the Hollywood.

353
00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:41.522
Ah, and that's where
you grab your leg.

354
00:18:41.556 --> 00:18:45.059
Ah, and it's really sore,
and you fall down. Hollywood.

355
00:18:45.093 --> 00:18:46.393
Arnold!

356
00:18:49.262 --> 00:18:51.198
Get up! Up, up, up!

357
00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:53.668
Oh, nice. Now, we're gonna
practice pointing and blaming

358
00:18:53.701 --> 00:18:56.269
where you point to someone
and just blame them.

359
00:18:56.303 --> 00:18:57.939
Wait, wait, wait.

360
00:19:01.408 --> 00:19:03.811
Ah. Mr. Rongen.

361
00:19:07.347 --> 00:19:08.783
Nice, little buddy. Okay.

362
00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:11.853
Go into the shop,
get me that bottle
we talked about.

363
00:19:11.886 --> 00:19:13.453
Off you go.
Thanks, little buddy.

364
00:19:14.055 --> 00:19:15.623
Run!

365
00:19:15.657 --> 00:19:16.891
Well, gentlemen.

366
00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:19.694
I've been watching you.

367
00:19:19.727 --> 00:19:22.362
And it's safe to say,
you're useless.

368
00:19:22.396 --> 00:19:26.968
You have zero talent, skill
or understanding of the game.

369
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:31.939
That is why we're gonna work
on two very simple things.

370
00:19:31.973 --> 00:19:34.408
Fitness and discipline.

371
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:36.711
<i>Cacio</i> and the <i>pepe.</i>

372
00:19:36.744 --> 00:19:37.745
Cheese and pepper.

373
00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:41.181
Simple dish
but when made well,
exquisite.

374
00:19:41.214 --> 00:19:42.617
So, this is what
we're gonna do.

375
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.318
We're gonna get into two lines
and we're gonna do sprints.

376
00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.287
Down to the goal and back.

377
00:19:47.955 --> 00:19:49.256
Two lines!
Suicides!

378
00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:52.760
Cheese and pepper!
Come on, let's go! Go!

379
00:19:52.794 --> 00:19:53.761
Why are we doing this?

380
00:19:53.795 --> 00:19:55.963
Because I want to see
what you're made of.

381
00:19:55.997 --> 00:19:58.066
You're all a bunch
of Daniel-sans.

382
00:19:58.099 --> 00:19:59.534
And I'm Mr. Miyagi.

383
00:19:59.567 --> 00:20:02.269
I want to see how many of you
can make the full 90 minutes.

384
00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:04.706
Let's go! <i>Cacio pepe!</i>

385
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:16.283
Oh, Jaiyah.
Hi!

386
00:20:17.585 --> 00:20:18.953
Hi, boys.

387
00:20:18.986 --> 00:20:20.822
Hey, hey, guys!
What's going on?

388
00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:23.124
What were we just
talking about? Discipline.

389
00:20:23.157 --> 00:20:25.860
All right. 200 sit-ups
down at the goal.

390
00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:26.894
Go!

391
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:29.130
Go, go, 200!

392
00:20:29.163 --> 00:20:30.865
Hey, coach,
I'm so sorry
I'm late.

393
00:20:30.898 --> 00:20:33.067
Oh. Ah, ah.

394
00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:34.502
I just came in
from Hawaii.

395
00:20:34.535 --> 00:20:36.738
I'm in middle of, uh,
talking to the squad
right now.

396
00:20:36.771 --> 00:20:37.905
So, uh...

397
00:20:37.939 --> 00:20:39.439
You must be
team masseuse.

398
00:20:39.473 --> 00:20:40.808
Why don't you, uh,
set up in the...

399
00:20:40.842 --> 00:20:42.309
Oh. No, no, no.
I'm not the team masseuse.

400
00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:43.845
I'm one of
the players.

401
00:20:43.878 --> 00:20:46.881
Oh, no, I don't know
where the women's team train,

402
00:20:46.914 --> 00:20:47.849
but it isn't here.

403
00:20:47.882 --> 00:20:50.985
Oh, no, no, no.
Jaiyah's placed
in the team.

404
00:20:51.018 --> 00:20:52.419
This team.

405
00:20:53.386 --> 00:20:54.454
She's a woman.

406
00:20:54.488 --> 00:20:56.691
Well,
not yet.

407
00:20:57.491 --> 00:20:59.160
What the hell's
going on? Ace?

408
00:20:59.193 --> 00:21:00.393
That's Jaiyah.

409
00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:02.530
She's our center forward.
Jaiyah.

410
00:21:03.664 --> 00:21:07.902
Okay. Good one.

411
00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:09.369
Humor. I get it.

412
00:21:09.402 --> 00:21:12.240
Sure, Jaiyah, go ahead.
Join the squad
over there.

413
00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.142
Thanks so much, coach.

414
00:21:14.175 --> 00:21:16.376
Joke's on you now.
She's playing.

415
00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:18.311
Very good.

416
00:21:18.345 --> 00:21:20.014
Something not right
about this guy.

417
00:21:20.047 --> 00:21:22.382
Well, he is white.

418
00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:24.384
No. Something else.

419
00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:26.954
Let's keep
our eye on him.

420
00:21:28.823 --> 00:21:30.158
All right, Ace.

421
00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:31.526
Let's see what
they're made of.

422
00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:33.326
Look alive,
bitches!

423
00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:35.630
All right, come on.
We're up.

424
00:21:35.663 --> 00:21:39.033
Wow, a ball!
Mr. Miyagi is really
shaking things up.

425
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.271
Okay, Ace. Run me
through the team.
Who we got?

426
00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:46.240
Okay, uh, that's Smiley.

427
00:21:46.274 --> 00:21:48.276
He's the D'Angelo
of soccer.

428
00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:50.211
Hey, Smiley!

429
00:21:50.244 --> 00:21:52.780
Yeah. Oh!
And that's Daru.

430
00:21:52.814 --> 00:21:54.949
He's known as the Bad Boy
of soccer.

431
00:21:54.982 --> 00:21:58.920
He's always sliding in
and getting carded. Very bad.

432
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:02.056
Oh, that is Samson.

433
00:22:02.089 --> 00:22:03.257
What? Because of his hair?

434
00:22:03.291 --> 00:22:04.491
No, Samsung.

435
00:22:04.525 --> 00:22:08.328
He's named after the giant
Korean tech company.

436
00:22:08.361 --> 00:22:10.631
His father's name is Sony.

437
00:22:10.665 --> 00:22:15.368
Oh, and there's Jaiyah,
the Cindy Crawford
of soccer.

438
00:22:15.402 --> 00:22:16.804
What's his real name?

439
00:22:17.572 --> 00:22:19.941
Jaiyah.
No, registered name.

440
00:22:19.974 --> 00:22:22.442
Oh, it's Johnny.
But you never want
to call her that.

441
00:22:22.475 --> 00:22:24.579
Yeah.
She's Fa'afafine.

442
00:22:24.612 --> 00:22:25.947
What does that mean?

443
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.682
It's part of our culture.

444
00:22:27.715 --> 00:22:30.284
They're just one of us.
But different.

445
00:22:30.318 --> 00:22:32.119
But you guys
are all cool
with this?

446
00:22:32.153 --> 00:22:33.688
How can I put this?
It's like

447
00:22:33.721 --> 00:22:37.258
imagine a world
without flowers.

448
00:22:37.291 --> 00:22:40.261
Well, Fa'afafine
are our flowers.

449
00:22:40.294 --> 00:22:42.230
Be a pretty dull world
without them.

450
00:22:42.263 --> 00:22:45.498
Hmm? They're beautiful.

451
00:22:45.533 --> 00:22:48.169
And who's that
large body in goal?

452
00:22:48.202 --> 00:22:49.436
Oh, that's Pisa.

453
00:22:49.469 --> 00:22:51.505
He's not really a goalkeeper.
He's a midfielder,

454
00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:52.573
but he found the gloves

455
00:22:52.607 --> 00:22:54.108
when Nicky...
Wait, wait, wait.

456
00:22:54.141 --> 00:22:55.877
Who's that?

457
00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:59.113
That's Jonah.
He's the Knight Rider Car
of soccer.

458
00:23:10.124 --> 00:23:11.759
Bring it in.

459
00:23:11.792 --> 00:23:14.161
Whistle, whistle.
Bring it in.

460
00:23:14.195 --> 00:23:15.462
Bring it in, team!

461
00:23:17.331 --> 00:23:18.599
Sit down, sit down.

462
00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:22.837
That was terrible.

463
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.839
You're just pissing around
out there.

464
00:23:24.872 --> 00:23:27.074
You need passion
to play this game.

465
00:23:27.108 --> 00:23:28.809
It's embarrassing.

466
00:23:28.843 --> 00:23:31.112
I've every right to put
my foot up all your asses.

467
00:23:33.714 --> 00:23:34.949
Oh, that's funny
to you?

468
00:23:34.982 --> 00:23:37.484
Well, yeah. I mean,
it's a funny image.

469
00:23:37.518 --> 00:23:39.287
Sorry. Just trying
to have fun.

470
00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.588
Football's fun.

471
00:23:41.055 --> 00:23:42.623
Football's fun.

472
00:23:42.657 --> 00:23:44.325
I'll tell you
what's not fun.

473
00:23:44.358 --> 00:23:46.360
Watching you prancing
and parading,

474
00:23:46.394 --> 00:23:48.996
fixing your hair
like <i>My Little Pony.</i>

475
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.531
That's not fun.

476
00:23:53.234 --> 00:23:54.769
Armani.

477
00:23:54.802 --> 00:23:57.571
This young gentleman here
is what I'm talking about.

478
00:23:58.506 --> 00:24:01.142
This is passion
personified.

479
00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:04.477
If I had 11 Armani's,
I could conquer the world.

480
00:24:04.512 --> 00:24:07.381
But alas,
I only have the one.

481
00:24:07.415 --> 00:24:08.983
I'll take that.

482
00:24:09.016 --> 00:24:10.918
You know what?
I've had it for today.

483
00:24:10.952 --> 00:24:12.920
I'm going to leave
Armani in charge.

484
00:24:13.788 --> 00:24:17.457
He's going to be
my eyes and my ears.

485
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.794
Anything Armani says, you do.

486
00:24:20.761 --> 00:24:24.065
Armani?
What shall we do today?

487
00:24:26.367 --> 00:24:29.469
Everybody,
shoulder exercise up.

488
00:24:29.503 --> 00:24:33.908
Up, down, up, down.
Double time.

489
00:24:35.076 --> 00:24:37.812
<i>Welcome</i>
<i>to your voice mailbox.</i>

490
00:24:37.845 --> 00:24:41.048
<i>You have 18 saved messages.</i>

491
00:24:41.716 --> 00:24:44.151
<i>First saved message.</i>

492
00:24:44.185 --> 00:24:45.219
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

493
00:24:45.252 --> 00:24:46.654
<i>I just saw you called.</i>

494
00:24:47.188 --> 00:24:49.123
<i>Where are you?</i>

495
00:24:49.156 --> 00:24:53.260
<i>Seriously. Like,</i>
<i>where in the world</i>
<i>is Thomas Rongen?</i>

496
00:24:54.428 --> 00:24:56.464
<i>Okay, call me back.</i>

497
00:25:18.986 --> 00:25:22.890
Old tin cans,
old tin cans!

498
00:25:22.923 --> 00:25:24.825
That's what
I'm collecting.

499
00:25:24.859 --> 00:25:29.163
People just throw them away.
They wash up on the shore.

500
00:25:29.196 --> 00:25:33.300
They used to be valuable.
Not so much anymore.

501
00:25:33.334 --> 00:25:34.602
Is she talking to me?

502
00:25:34.635 --> 00:25:38.739
You're feeling alone,
because you are alone.

503
00:25:38.773 --> 00:25:41.409
Like these old metal cans.

504
00:25:41.442 --> 00:25:43.477
This isn't happening.
It's a mirage.

505
00:25:43.512 --> 00:25:45.713
Yes, this is happening.

506
00:25:45.746 --> 00:25:49.383
You're just
a skinny white guy,
sitting there

507
00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:51.819
looking out to sea
for answers.

508
00:25:53.821 --> 00:25:58.993
But maybe the answers you seek
are right in front of you.

509
00:26:00.594 --> 00:26:03.898
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

510
00:26:03.931 --> 00:26:06.033
Even tin cans.

511
00:26:06.067 --> 00:26:08.402
Not that
plastic bottle there,
though.

512
00:26:08.436 --> 00:26:10.571
Not that.
Not touching that.

513
00:26:11.372 --> 00:26:14.543
Family is what you make it.

514
00:26:14.575 --> 00:26:18.079
Here I come,
the old tin can lady.

515
00:26:18.112 --> 00:26:20.281
Looking for
my tin cans...
Tin cans.

516
00:26:20.314 --> 00:26:21.582
...that's what I do

517
00:26:21.615 --> 00:26:23.017
- all day. Oh!
- Darling!

518
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.786
Oh, Tavita, you idiot!
Did you speak to him?

519
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.088
Yes, but what was all that

520
00:26:27.121 --> 00:26:29.657
tin can mumbo-jumbo shit
you made me say

521
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:31.225
and all that "family is what
you make it" crap?

522
00:26:31.258 --> 00:26:33.761
It sounded like
that old lady
from <i>The Matrix.</i>

523
00:26:33.794 --> 00:26:34.895
Nah, he's a Palagi.

524
00:26:34.929 --> 00:26:36.831
White people love
all that spiritual stuff.

525
00:26:36.864 --> 00:26:38.766
Can you imagine the world
without yoga?

526
00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:40.801
There'd be all this
unstretchy white people around

527
00:26:40.835 --> 00:26:43.404
with no ethnic tattoos.
And no white dreadlocks.

528
00:26:43.437 --> 00:26:45.673
Exactly! They need us.

529
00:26:46.173 --> 00:26:47.942
And I need that coach.

530
00:26:49.043 --> 00:26:51.546
Hey, guys!
That's great warming-upping.

531
00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.614
- Doing really well.
- Ace.

532
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:56.350
Oh! Mr. Rongen.

533
00:26:56.383 --> 00:26:57.818
Ace.
Yeah?

534
00:26:57.852 --> 00:27:00.855
You know,
I just had the most
profound conversation.

535
00:27:00.888 --> 00:27:03.190
It was all about tin cans.

536
00:27:03.224 --> 00:27:06.360
Our team, they're like
a bunch of tin cans.

537
00:27:06.393 --> 00:27:07.495
Look at them.

538
00:27:07.529 --> 00:27:09.263
Discarded, crumpled,

539
00:27:09.296 --> 00:27:10.231
sitting in a bunker,

540
00:27:10.264 --> 00:27:12.567
waiting for an apocalypse
that may never come.

541
00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:13.868
But guess what, Ace,

542
00:27:13.901 --> 00:27:15.703
we're gonna give
those cans a purpose.

543
00:27:15.736 --> 00:27:17.606
What's that, boss?

544
00:27:17.638 --> 00:27:19.240
We're going to start
a nuclear war.

545
00:27:20.441 --> 00:27:22.243
Gather around,
tin cans.

546
00:27:22.276 --> 00:27:23.177
Come on,
tin cans.

547
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.778
We're going
to practice free kicks.

548
00:27:24.812 --> 00:27:26.080
Hustle, double time!

549
00:27:26.113 --> 00:27:27.648
Double time,
double time, hustle.

550
00:27:27.681 --> 00:27:29.551
The art of taking
the free kick

551
00:27:29.584 --> 00:27:31.051
is about distraction.

552
00:27:31.085 --> 00:27:32.153
Here we go.

553
00:27:32.953 --> 00:27:34.989
- Whoa, whoa.
- Oh.

554
00:27:35.022 --> 00:27:36.323
And that's how
it's done.

555
00:27:36.357 --> 00:27:37.892
Distraction!

556
00:27:37.925 --> 00:27:39.793
Distraction. Follow my move.

557
00:27:40.161 --> 00:27:41.061
Hey!

558
00:27:41.095 --> 00:27:43.264
A small game called
the Human Hurdle.

559
00:27:43.297 --> 00:27:46.233
And jump! And jump!

560
00:27:47.134 --> 00:27:49.436
Stop.
You go around.

561
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.938
Cheese and pepper,
cheese and pepper!

562
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:53.908
The object of the game
is to hit the moving target.

563
00:27:54.441 --> 00:27:55.544
Useless.

564
00:27:55.577 --> 00:27:57.612
<i>♪ Baa, baa black sheep</i>

565
00:27:57.646 --> 00:27:58.879
<i>♪ Have you any wool? ♪</i>

566
00:27:58.913 --> 00:28:00.047
Keep the melody,
please.

567
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.583
<i>♪ Yes, sir, yes, sir ♪</i>

568
00:28:01.616 --> 00:28:02.683
Everybody wait.

569
00:28:02.716 --> 00:28:04.586
Stop play.
Stop play.

570
00:28:04.619 --> 00:28:06.453
Jaiyah, any reason
why you're late?

571
00:28:06.487 --> 00:28:07.656
Everybody else seemed

572
00:28:07.721 --> 00:28:09.757
to turn up on time
for training today.

573
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.892
Why don't you run over there
and do some slaloms.

574
00:28:11.926 --> 00:28:13.994
Off you go.
Let's go.

575
00:28:14.828 --> 00:28:16.163
Talk to one another.

576
00:28:16.197 --> 00:28:17.164
Come on! Concentrate.

577
00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:28.375
The object is turning speed.
Hustle, hustle.

578
00:28:28.409 --> 00:28:29.578
Hustle, hustle, bustle.

579
00:28:29.611 --> 00:28:30.811
You know what?
Forget about it.

580
00:28:30.844 --> 00:28:34.215
Forget about it.
Hup, hup, hup.

581
00:28:34.248 --> 00:28:36.183
- Guys, head up, head up.
- Get low, get low.

582
00:28:36.217 --> 00:28:37.985
Cheese and pepper!
Get out of
the way here.

583
00:28:38.018 --> 00:28:39.386
Cheese
and pepper!

584
00:28:40.689 --> 00:28:43.424
The object
is to get the ball
in the net.

585
00:28:43.457 --> 00:28:44.559
Concentrate.

586
00:28:44.593 --> 00:28:46.060
Look where
you're shooting it.

587
00:28:46.093 --> 00:28:47.394
What the hell!

588
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:50.764
Don't look at me,
look at the ball.

589
00:29:00.107 --> 00:29:02.443
Control it, Daru.
What is that? Is that a pass?

590
00:29:02.476 --> 00:29:03.777
One touch. Pass.

591
00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:06.280
One touch.
Pass, pass.
Come on.

592
00:29:07.448 --> 00:29:08.315
Jaiyah, focus.

593
00:29:08.349 --> 00:29:10.751
You're controlling
the back line, let's go!

594
00:29:10.784 --> 00:29:11.819
And how would I say,

595
00:29:11.852 --> 00:29:13.821
"You're all useless.
I'm out of here"?

596
00:29:15.557 --> 00:29:17.191
Way too long.
Forget it.

597
00:29:17.224 --> 00:29:18.593
Trust.

598
00:29:18.627 --> 00:29:21.829
Trust. Trust, okay. Trust.

599
00:29:23.063 --> 00:29:25.366
That's it, don't touch me.
Trust is broken.

600
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.138
All right.
It's getting serious now.

601
00:29:31.171 --> 00:29:33.974
We're going to play
full 90 minutes
with the ball.

602
00:29:34.008 --> 00:29:37.044
Shirts versus bibs.
Three touches only. Go!

603
00:29:37.077 --> 00:29:40.314
Go, go, go!

604
00:29:40.347 --> 00:29:42.249
That's it,
push up, push up.

605
00:29:42.283 --> 00:29:43.917
Pressure,
pressure,
pressure.

606
00:29:44.753 --> 00:29:45.953
A little bit of urgency.

607
00:29:45.986 --> 00:29:48.322
Look at him, he's got all
the space in the world.

608
00:29:48.355 --> 00:29:49.790
Jaiyah! Look alive.

609
00:29:49.823 --> 00:29:51.526
Concentrate.
Focus, Jaiyah.

610
00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:54.361
What are you waiting for?
Pressure, pressure, pressure.

611
00:29:56.096 --> 00:29:58.600
No, no, no!
Squeeze him, Daru.

612
00:29:58.633 --> 00:30:00.067
Stay on your feet, man.

613
00:30:03.003 --> 00:30:04.071
Jaiyah, what are you doing
over there?

614
00:30:04.104 --> 00:30:06.173
Stop playing
with your hair.

615
00:30:06.206 --> 00:30:08.510
What the hell's that?
Come here.

616
00:30:08.543 --> 00:30:09.877
Why are you fixing
your hair?

617
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:12.012
This isn't some
voguing competition.

618
00:30:12.046 --> 00:30:14.181
This is
international soccer.

619
00:30:14.214 --> 00:30:16.884
Stop that.
Get your shit together.

620
00:30:19.053 --> 00:30:21.021
Johnny, come back here
when I'm talking to you.

621
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.697
My name is not Johnny.

622
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:29.897
Your registered name
is Johnny.

623
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.498
You'll be playing
under the name Johnny.

624
00:30:31.533 --> 00:30:33.100
And that's what I'm going
to be calling you.

625
00:30:33.133 --> 00:30:35.269
So, get used to it,
Johnny.

626
00:30:39.139 --> 00:30:41.375
Call me Johnny,
again, one more time,

627
00:30:41.408 --> 00:30:43.210
and see what happens.

628
00:30:47.181 --> 00:30:48.315
Johnny.

629
00:30:49.684 --> 00:30:51.985
Oh, Jaiyah,
no, he's a coach.

630
00:30:52.019 --> 00:30:53.487
Naughty, naughty.

631
00:30:53.521 --> 00:30:54.723
Yeah, yeah.

632
00:30:56.357 --> 00:30:58.526
It's okay. I'm all right.

633
00:31:00.562 --> 00:31:02.229
Okay.

634
00:31:02.262 --> 00:31:04.131
Things are getting
pretty intense.

635
00:31:04.164 --> 00:31:06.934
So, it's, uh, time
to take a break, maybe.

636
00:31:07.868 --> 00:31:09.370
Ace, call lunch.

637
00:31:09.403 --> 00:31:11.606
You heard the man.
Have some lunch.

638
00:31:12.272 --> 00:31:13.675
Cooling down.

639
00:31:13.708 --> 00:31:16.276
Especially, if your name
rhymes with fire.

640
00:31:18.747 --> 00:31:20.615
<i>Sixth saved message.</i>

641
00:31:21.716 --> 00:31:22.950
<i>Okay, so,</i>

642
00:31:22.983 --> 00:31:24.853
<i>you don't actually know</i>
<i>how phones work</i>

643
00:31:24.885 --> 00:31:26.320
<i>is the vibe I'm getting.</i>

644
00:31:26.353 --> 00:31:29.089
<i>When it makes a noise,</i>
<i>you answer it.</i>

645
00:31:29.123 --> 00:31:30.491
<i>I mean, I know</i>
<i>you're probably working</i>

646
00:31:30.525 --> 00:31:31.626
<i>with the team right now but</i>

647
00:31:31.659 --> 00:31:36.296
<i>maybe stop yelling at them</i>
<i>for a second and call me back.</i>

648
00:31:36.731 --> 00:31:38.098
<i>I'm around.</i>

649
00:31:45.906 --> 00:31:47.509
Hey, celebrity guy!

650
00:31:47.542 --> 00:31:49.042
Saw you on
<i>Who's On The Plane,</i>

651
00:31:49.076 --> 00:31:50.444
coach.

652
00:31:50.477 --> 00:31:53.347
Soccer coach, you got
the toughest job
on the island.

653
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.948
These guys are
shocking.

654
00:31:54.982 --> 00:31:57.217
- Shocking.
- Ah, coach!

655
00:31:57.251 --> 00:32:00.220
Welcome to
our humble restaurant.

656
00:32:00.254 --> 00:32:02.557
Tavita's Restaurant.
My restaurant.

657
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.892
How many jobs
have you got?

658
00:32:03.924 --> 00:32:05.492
Ah, we all have
a few jobs.

659
00:32:05.527 --> 00:32:08.495
We have to earn
enough money
to keep the team going.

660
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.666
<i>Garcon!</i> Son, Daru.
What?

661
00:32:11.699 --> 00:32:13.902
Please, escort
our esteemed guest

662
00:32:13.934 --> 00:32:16.504
to our exclusive
al fresco table.

663
00:32:16.538 --> 00:32:20.107
Please.
No special treatment.
I'll sit outside.

664
00:32:23.845 --> 00:32:26.079
They look up to you.
They depend on you.

665
00:32:26.113 --> 00:32:28.415
You got to be demanding.
But kind.

666
00:32:29.283 --> 00:32:30.284
Hello.

667
00:32:30.819 --> 00:32:32.019
Sir.

668
00:32:33.888 --> 00:32:35.155
Something to drink?

669
00:32:35.623 --> 00:32:38.125
Whiskey, beer, wine?

670
00:32:38.158 --> 00:32:40.093
Yeah, we got all those.
Which one?

671
00:32:40.127 --> 00:32:41.629
Whiskey, beer, and wine.

672
00:32:47.535 --> 00:32:48.837
Mr. Rongen.

673
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.305
Please accept this appetizer

674
00:32:51.338 --> 00:32:54.107
of raw fish marinated
in coconut cream.

675
00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:56.043
It's a real classic
of the islands.

676
00:32:56.076 --> 00:32:57.879
And it's on the house.

677
00:32:57.912 --> 00:32:59.213
How are things going?

678
00:32:59.246 --> 00:33:01.148
I can honestly say
it's the worst bunch
of players

679
00:33:01.181 --> 00:33:02.550
I've ever come across
in my life.

680
00:33:02.584 --> 00:33:03.484
Oh.

681
00:33:03.518 --> 00:33:05.787
I have very
particular methods.

682
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.254
And unless I get
the support I need,

683
00:33:07.287 --> 00:33:09.356
I just don't think
it's going to work.

684
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:12.159
We have
our own methods too.
Traditions.

685
00:33:12.192 --> 00:33:13.928
It's like
with that appetizer.

686
00:33:13.962 --> 00:33:15.162
I'm sure that little fish

687
00:33:15.195 --> 00:33:17.097
didn't think that one day
it would be chopped up,

688
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.298
covered in spring onions,

689
00:33:18.332 --> 00:33:20.167
a little bit of tomato,
yellow pepper,

690
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.904
lemon zest
and a dash of chili.

691
00:33:22.937 --> 00:33:25.072
But if you ask
anyone around here,

692
00:33:25.105 --> 00:33:27.374
it's a better fish
because of it.

693
00:33:28.141 --> 00:33:30.812
You may need
to just marinate, too.

694
00:33:30.845 --> 00:33:32.312
See how you feel.

695
00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.448
One goal.

696
00:33:36.016 --> 00:33:37.451
One goal.

697
00:33:39.554 --> 00:33:40.722
One goal.

698
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:43.357
One goal.

699
00:33:45.292 --> 00:33:46.426
One goal.

700
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.063
One goal.

701
00:33:59.941 --> 00:34:02.042
Wow. That's really good.
It's really good!

702
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:08.348
♪ <i>I want to swing♪</i>

703
00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:30.203
Yes, I'm going to need
immediate backup.

704
00:34:30.237 --> 00:34:32.372
I'm engaged
in a car chase.

705
00:34:32.406 --> 00:34:34.308
<i>Wow, really?</i>
Looks like a Palagi guy,

706
00:34:34.341 --> 00:34:35.777
he's driving like a maniac.

707
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:38.980
He's maybe doing
35, 36 MPHs.

708
00:34:39.013 --> 00:34:41.716
<i>That's fast!</i>
Also, um, my, uh,

709
00:34:41.749 --> 00:34:43.350
my siren's not working.

710
00:34:43.383 --> 00:34:45.887
<i>Oh, jeez!</i>
<i>Okay, stay safe, Rambo.</i>

711
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.087
<i>Oh, and can you get some kava</i>

712
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.523
<i>from Uncle Pese</i>
<i>on the way home?</i>

713
00:34:48.556 --> 00:34:50.424
Uh, copy that.
Yeah, okay,
I love you, Mom.

714
00:34:50.457 --> 00:34:52.527
<i>I love you too, baby.</i>
Okay, love you.

715
00:35:00.334 --> 00:35:01.569
- Shit.
<i>- Yeah,</i>

716
00:35:01.603 --> 00:35:02.737
<i>this is the policeman.</i>

717
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:05.940
<i>Can you please pull over</i>
<i>to the side? Yes.</i>

718
00:35:11.546 --> 00:35:12.981
<i>You're going to get</i>

719
00:35:13.014 --> 00:35:14.515

720

<i>Are you ready?</i>

721
00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:17.852
Three.

722
00:35:19.887 --> 00:35:20.888
Thank you.

723
00:35:22.657 --> 00:35:24.491
Okay, you punk rocker.

724
00:35:24.525 --> 00:35:27.394
Oh, hey, it's the guy
from the TV!

725
00:35:27.427 --> 00:35:29.296
That's me. What seems
to be the problem?

726
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:32.600
Oh, I'll tell you
what the...

727
00:35:32.634 --> 00:35:34.267
Hey, you okay?

728
00:35:34.301 --> 00:35:37.939
Hey. Let it out, big guy.
I got you.

729
00:35:43.511 --> 00:35:46.179
Oh, thank you.
I'm feeling better now.

730
00:35:46.213 --> 00:35:47.649
Now, listen, normally,

731
00:35:47.682 --> 00:35:49.817
I'd lock you up
and throw away the key.

732
00:35:49.851 --> 00:35:50.785
But right now,

733
00:35:50.818 --> 00:35:53.021
I'm just more angry
at my mango juice can.

734
00:35:53.054 --> 00:35:55.355
You stupid can!

735
00:35:57.859 --> 00:35:59.060
Fleetwood Mac!

736
00:35:59.093 --> 00:36:01.562
That's a hell of a right foot
you got there,

737
00:36:01.596 --> 00:36:03.564
Fa'agaloagliga.

738
00:36:03.598 --> 00:36:04.599
Rambo.

739
00:36:05.133 --> 00:36:06.901
Rambo.

740
00:36:06.934 --> 00:36:10.203
Gentlemen,
allow me to present
our newest recruit,

741
00:36:10.872 --> 00:36:12.640
Detective Rambo.

742
00:36:12.674 --> 00:36:15.308
We already kicked him out.
He tried to arrest us all.

743
00:36:15.342 --> 00:36:16.711
You were playing
on private property.

744
00:36:16.744 --> 00:36:18.278
Yeah, that property
is my dad's property.

745
00:36:18.311 --> 00:36:19.847
Well, I don't make up
the rules, okay?

746
00:36:19.881 --> 00:36:20.915
Yeah?
Yeah.

747
00:36:23.718 --> 00:36:24.852
Bravo.

748
00:36:24.886 --> 00:36:26.921
You've just fallen
for the oldest trick
in the book.

749
00:36:27.689 --> 00:36:28.690
Can't you see?

750
00:36:28.723 --> 00:36:30.892
This is exactly what
they want from us.

751
00:36:30.925 --> 00:36:32.292
- Who?
- Them!

752
00:36:33.094 --> 00:36:34.629
The Imperialists.

753
00:36:35.163 --> 00:36:37.131
Divide and conquer.

754
00:36:37.165 --> 00:36:38.398
But we're not going
to let them.

755
00:36:38.432 --> 00:36:41.069
We've worked too long
and hard for this.

756
00:36:41.102 --> 00:36:42.904
You've only been here
a few days.

757
00:36:42.937 --> 00:36:45.338
Rome was built
in a day, man.

758
00:36:45.372 --> 00:36:47.274
I think we're doing
pretty well.

759
00:36:47.842 --> 00:36:49.177
Now, how about this?

760
00:36:49.209 --> 00:36:52.714
As a team, together,
we climb that mountain.

761
00:36:52.747 --> 00:36:53.748
Who's with me?

762
00:36:54.115 --> 00:36:55.149
No.

763
00:36:55.183 --> 00:36:56.216
Coach,
my ankle is hurting me.

764
00:36:56.249 --> 00:36:58.351
I can't hear you.
Who's with me?

765
00:36:58.385 --> 00:37:00.220
No, no, my mom is
expecting me.

766
00:37:00.253 --> 00:37:03.457
Come on, guys!
We're all in this together.

767
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.059
Now, who's going
to climb
that mountain

768
00:37:05.093 --> 00:37:06.828
with me as a team?

769
00:37:06.861 --> 00:37:07.862
Are you with me?

770
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.065
Are you with me,
my team?

771
00:37:11.099 --> 00:37:12.533
Yeah, okay,
then, yeah.
All right!

772
00:37:12.567 --> 00:37:14.168
- Okay, let's go. Yes.
- Go.

773
00:37:14.202 --> 00:37:15.435
- Let's go!
- Yeah.

774
00:37:15.469 --> 00:37:17.505
Now, we're making
some progress.

775
00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:24.145
Wait, wait, wait.
What's going on?

776
00:37:24.178 --> 00:37:25.445
Don't sit down.

777
00:37:25.479 --> 00:37:27.782
We're not there yet.
We haven't even started.

778
00:37:27.815 --> 00:37:30.752
Ace, what's going on?
It's curfew time.

779
00:37:30.785 --> 00:37:31.686
What?

780
00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:33.921
The bell means curfew.
It's time to pray.

781
00:37:33.955 --> 00:37:37.457
The whole island stops.
Same time, every day.

782
00:37:37.491 --> 00:37:39.459
But what am I
supposed to do?
I'm not religious.

783
00:37:40.194 --> 00:37:41.428
Pretend?

784
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.100
Okay.
I'll pray for you.

785
00:37:46.134 --> 00:37:49.170
When did that
ever work? Tavita!

786
00:37:52.507 --> 00:37:54.208
I've got three weeks left
to the qualifiers.

787
00:37:54.242 --> 00:37:55.475
We got a lot
of work to do.

788
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.344
So, tomorrow, I'm going
to start with fitness drills

789
00:37:57.377 --> 00:37:59.412
to see how many of them
can last a full 90 minutes.

790
00:37:59.747 --> 00:38:00.715
Ooh. Ah.

791
00:38:00.748 --> 00:38:03.217
Thomas, ah,
we won't be training
tomorrow.

792
00:38:03.251 --> 00:38:05.086
Why not?
It's Sunday.

793
00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:06.621
So?
The team won't train

794
00:38:06.654 --> 00:38:08.222
on a Sunday.
That would be a sin.

795
00:38:08.256 --> 00:38:09.289
Jesus Christ.

796
00:38:09.322 --> 00:38:11.125
Mr. Rongen,
you are very welcome

797
00:38:11.159 --> 00:38:12.292
to join us on Sunday.

798
00:38:12.325 --> 00:38:14.361
It could be
a nice experience.

799
00:38:14.394 --> 00:38:16.097
You can see
how we worship God.

800
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:18.331
This is church.
Football is church.

801
00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:20.134
You've got
zero commitment.

802
00:38:20.168 --> 00:38:21.769
We're very committed
to church.

803
00:38:21.803 --> 00:38:24.138
This place
is a carnival
of crap.

804
00:38:24.172 --> 00:38:25.405
Hey, look at this,
look at this.

805
00:38:25.438 --> 00:38:26.574
This bit, right here.
Right here.

806
00:38:26.607 --> 00:38:27.642
<i>Off goes the chair.</i>

807
00:38:27.675 --> 00:38:29.409
- Ooh.
- This guy's been fired

808
00:38:29.442 --> 00:38:30.845
from his
three jobs because

809
00:38:30.878 --> 00:38:31.779
he can't control himself.

810
00:38:31.813 --> 00:38:33.781
I don't know.
He seems okay, now.

811
00:38:33.815 --> 00:38:34.982
Maybe he's different.

812
00:38:35.016 --> 00:38:36.117
I've coached
11-year-olds

813
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.350
better than your players!

814
00:38:38.553 --> 00:38:39.486
Sure.

815
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.655
I mean,
look at this place.

816
00:38:40.688 --> 00:38:43.323
You've got a keyboard
and mouse and no screen!

817
00:38:43.356 --> 00:38:45.059
None of this shit
makes any sense.

818
00:38:45.092 --> 00:38:47.528
You don't even have
a full squad
of players out there.

819
00:38:47.562 --> 00:38:49.564
No wonder
you're the worst team
in the world.

820
00:38:49.597 --> 00:38:51.498
Mr. Rongen,
you have made your point

821
00:38:51.532 --> 00:38:53.301
and now let me
make mine.

822
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:56.804
Now, we here at FFAS
are honored that you are here.

823
00:38:56.838 --> 00:38:59.339
We want to improve,
we want to learn from you.

824
00:38:59.372 --> 00:39:02.310
But we will not deny
who we are just to win.

825
00:39:02.342 --> 00:39:04.512
These are our customs.
These are our ways.

826
00:39:04.545 --> 00:39:07.315
Your ways are shit.
You're failing.

827
00:39:07.347 --> 00:39:09.717
It's torture
coaching this team.

828
00:39:12.352 --> 00:39:14.655
Thomas, we were
under the impression

829
00:39:14.689 --> 00:39:17.058
that you wanted to be here.

830
00:39:17.091 --> 00:39:19.827
But if that is
the wrong impression
that we are under,

831
00:39:19.861 --> 00:39:21.829
then you are free to go.

832
00:39:21.863 --> 00:39:24.232
Seek your happiness.

833
00:39:24.265 --> 00:39:25.666
Unhappiness is a curse

834
00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.835
that I would not wish
on anyone.

835
00:39:33.074 --> 00:39:35.176
Okay. I quit.

836
00:39:46.053 --> 00:39:47.121
I told you guys.

837
00:39:52.994 --> 00:39:54.262
Hello?

838
00:39:54.295 --> 00:39:55.763
- Can you hear me?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

839
00:39:55.796 --> 00:40:00.167
So, uh, here's the news.
Fresh off the press. I quit.

840
00:40:00.201 --> 00:40:01.869
You can't quit.
<i>I quit.</i>

841
00:40:01.903 --> 00:40:03.271
Today, officially.

842
00:40:03.304 --> 00:40:05.339
Well, then go un-quit.
<i>Once you quit,</i>

843
00:40:05.373 --> 00:40:07.575
you got to commit
to the quit.
You know this.

844
00:40:07.608 --> 00:40:08.743
<i>It's like this team,</i>

845
00:40:08.776 --> 00:40:10.344
<i>they don't even</i>
<i>want to win.</i>

846
00:40:10.378 --> 00:40:12.346
For them, it's like
some sort of game.

847
00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.514
It is a game, Thomas.

848
00:40:13.547 --> 00:40:15.016
<i>It's a sport.</i>

849
00:40:15.049 --> 00:40:16.384
I can't work
with these guys.

850
00:40:16.416 --> 00:40:17.952
<i>I can't help them.</i>

851
00:40:17.985 --> 00:40:20.621
Thomas, we didn't
send you there
to help them.

852
00:40:20.655 --> 00:40:22.623
We sent you there
to help you.

853
00:40:24.792 --> 00:40:27.194
I don't need help.
I'm coming home.

854
00:40:27.228 --> 00:40:29.163
Home, I'm sorry, Thomas,

855
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.566
but where is home now?

856
00:40:36.103 --> 00:40:37.171
Look,

857
00:40:37.872 --> 00:40:39.040
we'll be there
in a couple weeks

858
00:40:39.073 --> 00:40:41.309
for the qualifiers, okay?
And we'll get a drink.

859
00:40:41.342 --> 00:40:42.543
<i>All right?</i>

860
00:41:10.705 --> 00:41:12.006
Dear Lord,

861
00:41:12.039 --> 00:41:12.974
if you could please

862
00:41:13.007 --> 00:41:15.343
let the coach come back
wherever he is,

863
00:41:15.376 --> 00:41:17.378
to help us score
that one goal.

864
00:41:17.411 --> 00:41:18.512
Just one.

865
00:41:18.546 --> 00:41:20.214
Not too much to ask,
I think,

866
00:41:20.247 --> 00:41:21.882
given we go to church
every Sunday

867
00:41:21.916 --> 00:41:23.417
and give 10 percent
of our income.

868
00:41:23.451 --> 00:41:24.752
But, uh, hey!

869
00:41:24.785 --> 00:41:27.188
All in your time.
<i>Amene.</i>

870
00:41:27.221 --> 00:41:29.056
<i>Amene.</i>

871
00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:32.593
Ah, that didn't work.

872
00:41:32.626 --> 00:41:35.863
Ace, looks like
you're coaching today.

873
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:40.668
Okay, just go for a run
to warm up your bodies, huh?

874
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.071
<i>Okay, Dad.</i>

875
00:41:44.105 --> 00:41:46.007
<i>I'm sorry I yelled at you.</i>

876
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.743
<i>But I was just pissed</i>
<i>because...</i>

877
00:41:48.776 --> 00:41:50.644
<i>because you should</i>
<i>be here for this.</i>

878
00:41:50.678 --> 00:41:53.280
<i>They asked me to lead</i>
<i>the team out on Saturday.</i>

879
00:41:54.248 --> 00:41:55.516
<i>Where are you?</i>

880
00:42:09.897 --> 00:42:10.998
Hi, coach.

881
00:42:13.134 --> 00:42:14.135
Hi.

882
00:42:15.636 --> 00:42:18.339
I just wanted to come by
and say sorry

883
00:42:18.372 --> 00:42:20.307
about body slamming you
to the ground

884
00:42:20.341 --> 00:42:21.809
and choking you, and

885
00:42:21.842 --> 00:42:24.545
also, just wanted to say
thank you

886
00:42:24.578 --> 00:42:26.680
for keeping me on the team

887
00:42:26.981 --> 00:42:28.115
so far.

888
00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:32.553
Well, uh, I'd like
to apologize too

889
00:42:32.586 --> 00:42:34.622
for not respecting
your name,

890
00:42:35.322 --> 00:42:36.323
Jaiyah.

891
00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.729
Here. Peace offering.

892
00:42:43.497 --> 00:42:46.233
What is it?
It's from team lunch.

893
00:42:46.267 --> 00:42:47.301
You keep missing out

894
00:42:47.334 --> 00:42:49.703
because you get angry
and run away.

895
00:42:49.737 --> 00:42:51.705
You know,
you should eat first.

896
00:42:51.739 --> 00:42:53.774
And, then get angry.

897
00:42:55.009 --> 00:42:56.511
Makes sense.

898
00:42:56.545 --> 00:42:57.945
Will you join me?

899
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.181
Sure.

900
00:43:01.516 --> 00:43:02.817
College is cool.

901
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.086
And I do some performing
when I'm not studying.

902
00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:06.921
So, do you think you'll come
back to the island

903
00:43:06.954 --> 00:43:08.389
once you finish
your degree?

904
00:43:08.422 --> 00:43:10.024
No. There's really
not much

905
00:43:10.057 --> 00:43:11.826
on the island
for young people.

906
00:43:11.859 --> 00:43:13.360
The job choices
come down

907
00:43:13.394 --> 00:43:15.963
to the tuna cannery
or the army.

908
00:43:15.996 --> 00:43:19.500
And I don't really like
fish or guns.

909
00:43:19.534 --> 00:43:21.368
So, you think you'll stay
in Hawaii then?

910
00:43:22.103 --> 00:43:23.604
Hmm. Maybe.

911
00:43:23.637 --> 00:43:25.606
I mean, there's not
as many fa'afafine there,

912
00:43:25.639 --> 00:43:28.209
so you do get
a bit more prejudice.

913
00:43:29.877 --> 00:43:31.745
So, I hear
you're married?

914
00:43:31.779 --> 00:43:33.814
And you have
a daughter.

915
00:43:33.848 --> 00:43:38.352
Yeah, but tell me more about
this, um, fa'afafine thing.

916
00:43:38.385 --> 00:43:39.653
What do you want
to know?

917
00:43:40.821 --> 00:43:42.957
I mean, what are you
down there?

918
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:44.258
Does it really matter
to you?

919
00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:46.595
Well, it matters
to the officials in the game.

920
00:43:46.627 --> 00:43:48.896
Okay, well,
right now I'm legal.

921
00:43:48.929 --> 00:43:51.198
But I have been
taking hormones
for a while and...

922
00:43:51.232 --> 00:43:52.700
Right now?

923
00:43:52.733 --> 00:43:54.603
Let's just say
that eventually,

924
00:43:54.635 --> 00:43:57.371
I technically
won't qualify
for the team.

925
00:44:00.674 --> 00:44:01.909
Can we talk soccer?

926
00:44:02.343 --> 00:44:03.978
Yes.

927
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:05.746
What am I
watching here?

928
00:44:05.779 --> 00:44:07.582
Why is everyone bunched up
like old ladies

929
00:44:07.616 --> 00:44:09.049
gathered at
a cake convention?

930
00:44:09.083 --> 00:44:10.985
Well, how are we supposed
to know about formation?

931
00:44:11.018 --> 00:44:13.254
No one taught us,
including you.

932
00:44:14.523 --> 00:44:15.923
Fair point.

933
00:44:15.956 --> 00:44:16.957
Look at this guy.

934
00:44:16.991 --> 00:44:18.359
Just standing there
in open space

935
00:44:18.392 --> 00:44:19.927
doing nothing.
Reminds me of you.

936
00:44:21.162 --> 00:44:22.229
That is me.

937
00:44:22.631 --> 00:44:24.098
Oh.

938
00:44:24.131 --> 00:44:26.667
Well, you're
a natural born defender.

939
00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.801
Not a forward.

940
00:44:27.835 --> 00:44:29.571
Wait, who is that
in goal?

941
00:44:29.604 --> 00:44:31.573
That's Nicky Salapu.

942
00:44:31.606 --> 00:44:33.575
That's Nicky Salapu?
Yeah.

943
00:44:33.608 --> 00:44:35.644
The guy that let in
over 30 goals?

944
00:44:35.676 --> 00:44:37.878
Yeah, but he saved
another 60.

945
00:44:37.912 --> 00:44:39.246
He looks pretty good.

946
00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.781
He's one of the best players
we've ever had.

947
00:44:40.814 --> 00:44:41.949
He's a legend.

948
00:44:41.982 --> 00:44:43.250
A legend of the fallen.

949
00:44:43.284 --> 00:44:46.086
Shut up.
You shut up,
it's my house.

950
00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.121
It's my island.

951
00:44:47.154 --> 00:44:48.989
I don't even know
why we're watching this.

952
00:44:49.023 --> 00:44:51.526
Because most of
these players
are retired.

953
00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.726
But they only gave up

954
00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.564
because everyone else
gave up on them.

955
00:44:55.597 --> 00:44:57.464
But if you came back
to coach us,

956
00:44:57.498 --> 00:44:59.066
I could help you
find them.

957
00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:00.834
Because they're
still good.

958
00:45:02.002 --> 00:45:03.737
I'll be the judge of that.

959
00:45:09.376 --> 00:45:12.012
Hey, famous guy
and Jaiyah!

960
00:45:17.586 --> 00:45:20.387
Thomas Rongen.
Nicky Salapu.

961
00:45:23.224 --> 00:45:26.060
Well I'll be
a son of a bitch.

962
00:45:26.093 --> 00:45:28.329
The chickens
have come home
to roast.

963
00:45:30.464 --> 00:45:33.934
You're the best goalkeeper
American Samoa ever had.

964
00:45:33.968 --> 00:45:37.738
I let in over 30 goals
at international level.

965
00:45:37.771 --> 00:45:41.676
You're the best goalkeeper
American Samoa ever had.

966
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:44.345
Isn't there something
about that defeat

967
00:45:44.378 --> 00:45:45.513
that still haunts you?

968
00:45:45.547 --> 00:45:47.948
That you can't let go of?
Of course.

969
00:45:47.982 --> 00:45:50.150
I replay that match
on Xbox.

970
00:45:50.184 --> 00:45:52.186
American Samoa
versus Australia.

971
00:45:52.219 --> 00:45:53.354
But I play alone.

972
00:45:53.387 --> 00:45:57.057
And I get my revenge every day
by beating them 32, nil.

973
00:45:57.091 --> 00:45:58.993
Don't you want revenge
on Australia?

974
00:45:59.026 --> 00:46:00.861
But instead of Australia,

975
00:46:00.894 --> 00:46:03.264
it would be on a bunch
of other Polynesian islands.

976
00:46:04.064 --> 00:46:06.133
Some of them are close
to Australia.

977
00:46:07.167 --> 00:46:09.036
How did you get
this coaching job?

978
00:46:09.069 --> 00:46:10.938
You're terrible
at this.

979
00:46:10.971 --> 00:46:13.040
Can you just come back
to the team?

980
00:46:13.073 --> 00:46:16.977
They need work, yeah.
And they need a lot of work,

981
00:46:17.011 --> 00:46:20.781
but I see a bunch of guys
in that team, including her

982
00:46:20.814 --> 00:46:23.484
who all work multiple jobs
just to play.

983
00:46:23.518 --> 00:46:25.587
Who've got more heart
and they're dreaming bigger

984
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.154
than nearly any
of the jaded fools

985
00:46:27.187 --> 00:46:28.489
that mess around
in the pro league

986
00:46:28.523 --> 00:46:30.057
for money
they don't deserve.

987
00:46:31.792 --> 00:46:33.193
Don't tell them I said that.

988
00:46:34.495 --> 00:46:36.598
Is he interested
in playing?

989
00:46:36.631 --> 00:46:38.232
No interest,
whatsoever.

990
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.634
Who's next?

991
00:46:45.205 --> 00:46:47.808
That's called chutzpah,
Armani.

992
00:46:47.841 --> 00:46:49.276
And we like it.

993
00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:50.512
Excuse me, Squire?

994
00:46:50.545 --> 00:46:52.212
Stretch the muscle.
Ace?

995
00:46:52.246 --> 00:46:54.448
Mr. Rongen! I thought
you'd abandoned us.

996
00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:55.816
Ace, I'd like to apologize.

997
00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:57.017
Oh.
But I won't.

998
00:46:57.051 --> 00:46:59.119
Oh.
As a rule,
I don't apologize.

999
00:46:59.153 --> 00:47:01.889
I'm not apologizing
for that, either.
So, sorry.

1000
00:47:01.922 --> 00:47:03.957
Daru? Daru, Daru.

1001
00:47:03.991 --> 00:47:06.528
Look, I know
you don't like me.

1002
00:47:06.561 --> 00:47:07.895
I don't like me.

1003
00:47:07.928 --> 00:47:10.831
But we need
to work together.

1004
00:47:10.864 --> 00:47:13.067
This formation is known
as the Sad Snowman.

1005
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.968
This player, interchangeable
with this player.

1006
00:47:15.002 --> 00:47:16.103
This can cross here,

1007
00:47:16.136 --> 00:47:18.872
switch it around,
works this way too.

1008
00:47:19.541 --> 00:47:20.575
So, who we got next?

1009
00:47:28.048 --> 00:47:29.383
We got another one.

1010
00:47:29.416 --> 00:47:30.719
Nice one, Armani.

1011
00:47:30.752 --> 00:47:33.187
Wax on, wax off.

1012
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.657
Wax on, wax off.

1013
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:36.924
We've also got
the three pigs.

1014
00:47:36.957 --> 00:47:38.325
The wolf is coming
all the way back here.

1015
00:47:38.359 --> 00:47:39.860
He's going to blow
your house down.

1016
00:47:39.893 --> 00:47:41.462
This is where we want to go.

1017
00:47:41.495 --> 00:47:43.330
All roads
lead to Rome.

1018
00:47:44.331 --> 00:47:45.700
What is this shit?

1019
00:47:45.734 --> 00:47:47.702
Fucking Sharpie.
Get me another board.

1020
00:47:47.736 --> 00:47:49.169
Think of it
like a fish.

1021
00:47:49.203 --> 00:47:52.439
On its own, slimy, smelly,
tasteless somewhat.

1022
00:47:52.473 --> 00:47:55.844
But add some coconut cream,
lemon zest, chili,

1023
00:47:55.876 --> 00:47:57.645
let that sucker
marinate.

1024
00:47:57.679 --> 00:47:59.547
Now you've got
something special.

1025
00:47:59.581 --> 00:48:01.181
Allow yourself
to marinate.

1026
00:48:01.215 --> 00:48:02.883
You'll be a better fish
for it.

1027
00:48:03.384 --> 00:48:04.853
Thank you, coach.

1028
00:48:04.885 --> 00:48:06.788
Ice is your friend.

1029
00:48:06.821 --> 00:48:08.889
It will help
those muscles.

1030
00:48:08.922 --> 00:48:10.859
Oh, got you
in the nads there.

1031
00:48:10.891 --> 00:48:12.794
Just another 25 minutes.

1032
00:48:16.698 --> 00:48:19.567
Three, four.
And then, other side.

1033
00:48:19.601 --> 00:48:22.102
Way off! Miss.

1034
00:48:22.136 --> 00:48:24.371
He finds it.

1035
00:48:24.405 --> 00:48:27.174
Get up.
Not at the top yet.
Keep going.

1036
00:48:27.207 --> 00:48:29.009
I know it's hard,
but if we can do this

1037
00:48:29.042 --> 00:48:30.812
as a team,
we have a chance.

1038
00:48:30.845 --> 00:48:32.814
<i>We've got defense sorted.</i>

1039
00:48:32.847 --> 00:48:34.948
But our midfield...
Mm-hmm.

1040
00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:37.017
All right, my man.

1041
00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:38.520
All right.
There you go.

1042
00:48:38.553 --> 00:48:39.587
Thank you, coach.

1043
00:48:39.621 --> 00:48:40.522
See you Monday?
For sure.

1044
00:48:40.555 --> 00:48:42.423
I won't let
you down, coach.
Amazing.

1045
00:48:43.424 --> 00:48:44.626
Excellent.

1046
00:48:50.632 --> 00:48:51.666
So, who's next?

1047
00:48:58.005 --> 00:48:59.707
Nice. Nice, Daru. Good energy.

1048
00:48:59.741 --> 00:49:01.709
Good energy.
Good, good, good.

1049
00:49:01.743 --> 00:49:03.645
Hop, hop, hop.
Bunny rabbit.

1050
00:49:03.678 --> 00:49:04.813
Push, push, push.

1051
00:49:04.846 --> 00:49:06.280
Good.
Control that back line.

1052
00:49:06.313 --> 00:49:08.982
That's it, Jaiyah, leadership.
That's what I'm talking about.

1053
00:49:09.016 --> 00:49:13.086
Pele, Maradona, Rongen.
Whoo!

1054
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.723
Wax on, wax off.

1055
00:49:15.757 --> 00:49:17.659
Wax on, wax off.

1056
00:49:18.091 --> 00:49:19.894
Wax on, wax off.

1057
00:49:19.928 --> 00:49:21.596
Look, right here.
Maldini.

1058
00:49:42.617 --> 00:49:44.251
Keep it up, keep it up.

1059
00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:46.821
Keep going, keep going.

1060
00:49:46.855 --> 00:49:48.455
I know it's hard,
but keep going.

1061
00:49:49.891 --> 00:49:51.926
I know you can make it
to the top.

1062
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.530
Come on, guys,
keep going, keep going.

1063
00:49:55.563 --> 00:49:57.231
Don't stop, don't stop.

1064
00:50:07.509 --> 00:50:08.643
Oh, God!

1065
00:50:10.912 --> 00:50:13.581
Oh, God.
It's beautiful.

1066
00:50:13.615 --> 00:50:14.782
You okay, coach?

1067
00:50:14.816 --> 00:50:16.183
It's beautiful.

1068
00:50:17.417 --> 00:50:18.318
Oh, my God.

1069
00:50:18.352 --> 00:50:20.287
It looked so easy
from the bottom.

1070
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.724
Can't breathe.

1071
00:50:22.757 --> 00:50:25.727
This spot here, this place,

1072
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.396
tells of how
your brave brothers

1073
00:50:29.429 --> 00:50:34.034
fought to protect
American Samoa

1074
00:50:34.067 --> 00:50:36.804
and the rest of the world
against evil.

1075
00:50:37.605 --> 00:50:40.240
Well, tomorrow, we set off

1076
00:50:40.274 --> 00:50:43.011
for the greatest war
of them all!

1077
00:50:43.043 --> 00:50:46.714
The war for World Cup
qualification.

1078
00:50:46.748 --> 00:50:48.048
Yeah!

1079
00:50:49.416 --> 00:50:51.318
Oh, my God,
the air is thin up here.

1080
00:50:52.486 --> 00:50:54.154
In two days' time,

1081
00:50:55.823 --> 00:50:58.726
we face our first enemy,
Tonga.

1082
00:51:00.995 --> 00:51:02.496
Screw those guys!

1083
00:51:03.665 --> 00:51:07.167
There have been so many wars
against those assholes.

1084
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:11.005
But the war of 1825,

1085
00:51:11.039 --> 00:51:12.840
where they came to take...

1086
00:51:13.775 --> 00:51:15.710
they came to take our tuna.

1087
00:51:17.679 --> 00:51:22.149
But we handed their asses
to them in a giant tuna can.

1088
00:51:24.619 --> 00:51:25.687
Where am I?

1089
00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.956
Uh, Mr. Rongen,
are you feeling all right?

1090
00:51:27.989 --> 00:51:30.558
What was that?
I still have to pack.

1091
00:51:30.592 --> 00:51:32.060
I always leave packing

1092
00:51:32.092 --> 00:51:34.062
to the last minute.
It's so weird.

1093
00:51:36.129 --> 00:51:39.199
Healing waters.
Yeah, take him down.

1094
00:51:39.232 --> 00:51:41.069
Yeah. It's all right, coach.

1095
00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:47.307
<i>And so,</i>
<i>we turn to Matthew 17</i>

1096
00:51:47.341 --> 00:51:51.813
<i>when a man says to lesu,</i>
<i>"Lord, have mercy on my son.</i>

1097
00:51:51.846 --> 00:51:53.915
<i>"For he is a lunatic</i>

1098
00:51:53.948 --> 00:51:55.984
<i>"and is very ill.</i>

1099
00:51:56.017 --> 00:51:58.086
<i>"For he often falls</i>
<i>into the fire</i>

1100
00:51:58.118 --> 00:52:00.320
<i>"and often into the water.</i>

1101
00:52:00.354 --> 00:52:02.991
<i>"Very clumsy, my boy."</i>

1102
00:52:03.024 --> 00:52:06.794
<i>And lesu said,</i>
<i>"Bring him here to me."</i>

1103
00:52:06.828 --> 00:52:08.295
<i>Good old lesu.</i>

1104
00:52:08.328 --> 00:52:10.297
<i>And lesu rebuked him.</i>

1105
00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:12.399
<i>And the demon came out of him.</i>

1106
00:52:13.266 --> 00:52:15.903
<i>And the boy was cured at once.</i>

1107
00:52:18.906 --> 00:52:20.742
<i>What a beautiful day.</i>

1108
00:52:20.775 --> 00:52:22.275
<i>We give thanks</i>

1109
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:26.146
for the beauties outside,
all the blessings.

1110
00:52:26.179 --> 00:52:28.415
And, uh, before
we get further

1111
00:52:28.448 --> 00:52:30.484
into the proceedings,
a little housekeeping.

1112
00:52:30.518 --> 00:52:32.486
Someone was seen
rifling around

1113
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:35.089
in, uh, one of
the dumpsters outside

1114
00:52:35.123 --> 00:52:37.290
Sione Malacoco's
Fish and Chip Shop.

1115
00:52:37.324 --> 00:52:38.626
Fess up,
who was that?

1116
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.628
Trying to get
some leftover scraps.

1117
00:52:40.662 --> 00:52:41.829
We don't do that.

1118
00:52:41.863 --> 00:52:44.966
Okay? Now, what a day.

1119
00:52:44.999 --> 00:52:46.400
Our wonderful team

1120
00:52:46.433 --> 00:52:50.337
are going across the seas
to do the impossible.

1121
00:52:51.338 --> 00:52:53.941
To go and win
a game of soccer.

1122
00:52:55.043 --> 00:52:56.243
Wow!

1123
00:52:57.679 --> 00:52:58.846
Wowie!

1124
00:52:59.881 --> 00:53:02.349
Some would say
that the other teams
are too big.

1125
00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:05.318
Well, you know
what I say to them?

1126
00:53:06.186 --> 00:53:07.588
Read the Bible <i>.</i>

1127
00:53:07.622 --> 00:53:10.390
<i>Have you ever heard</i>
<i>of a little guy called David</i>

1128
00:53:10.424 --> 00:53:13.127
<i>fighting against a big guy</i>
<i>called the Goliath?</i>

1129
00:53:14.227 --> 00:53:15.963
<i>That is a cautionary tale.</i>

1130
00:53:15.997 --> 00:53:17.297
<i>Don't mess</i>
<i>with the little guy.</i>

1131
00:53:18.766 --> 00:53:19.701
<i>And what we have here</i>

1132
00:53:19.734 --> 00:53:22.637
is a whole bunch
of little guys, don't we?

1133
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:25.372
Little guys,
who probably can't do it.

1134
00:53:25.405 --> 00:53:27.108
<i>Going off across the seas</i>

1135
00:53:27.141 --> 00:53:28.943
<i>to fight a whole lot</i>
<i>of Goliaths.</i>

1136
00:53:30.011 --> 00:53:32.345
<i>So, go, my little Davids.</i>

1137
00:53:32.379 --> 00:53:35.083
<i>Let's take it</i>
<i>to Mr. Goliath out there.</i>

1138
00:53:35.116 --> 00:53:37.885
<i>And let's get one</i>
<i>for American Samoa.</i>

1139
00:53:40.788 --> 00:53:41.823
Okay.

1140
00:54:00.842 --> 00:54:02.210
<i>So, off they go.</i>

1141
00:54:02.242 --> 00:54:04.444
<i>The American Samoan</i>
<i>soccer team</i>

1142
00:54:04.478 --> 00:54:07.715
<i>hoping not to embarrass</i>
<i>the nation any further.</i>

1143
00:54:07.749 --> 00:54:10.785
Cut. That was really good,
Gus.

1144
00:54:13.386 --> 00:54:16.289
Go, go, go, go!

1145
00:54:17.892 --> 00:54:22.797
Tavita, let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Come on, move it!

1146
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.603
Let's get this bird
in the air!

1147
00:54:35.176 --> 00:54:36.944
Wowie, that was
some journey!

1148
00:54:36.978 --> 00:54:39.446
Yeah, I think I got
the jet lags.
I need a nap.

1149
00:54:39.479 --> 00:54:41.649
Guys, it was only
a 35 minute flight.

1150
00:54:41.682 --> 00:54:42.517
Hey, guys!

1151
00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:44.384
We've officially crossed
the date line.

1152
00:54:44.417 --> 00:54:46.220
It's now yesterday.

1153
00:54:46.254 --> 00:54:47.287
Time travel!

1154
00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.488
Look how fast

1155
00:54:48.523 --> 00:54:49.957
these crazies
are going.

1156
00:54:49.991 --> 00:54:52.359
You know,
someone's going
to get killed.

1157
00:54:52.392 --> 00:54:55.763
Slow down.
Heaven's full.

1158
00:54:56.664 --> 00:54:58.365
Yo,
some pretty sweet digs.

1159
00:54:58.398 --> 00:55:00.935
Okay, boys. Good,
you're settling in.

1160
00:55:00.968 --> 00:55:02.937
Now, I just have
one note here.

1161
00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:04.639
Shh.
The player reception is

1162
00:55:04.672 --> 00:55:08.743
at 5:30 in the PM time.
And it's compulsory feetwear.

1163
00:55:08.776 --> 00:55:10.778
So, wear something
on your feet, please.

1164
00:55:10.812 --> 00:55:15.415
Like a slippers.
Or a sandal.
Okay, yeah.

1165
00:55:15.448 --> 00:55:16.784
Thanks.

1166
00:55:21.321 --> 00:55:23.791
Tonga, Tonga.

1167
00:55:34.302 --> 00:55:35.636
Nice of you guys
to show up.

1168
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:36.971
That's very kind.
Thank you.

1169
00:55:37.004 --> 00:55:38.172
It was an insult!

1170
00:55:38.206 --> 00:55:40.675
Oh, I should've known
you were going
to put a twist on it.

1171
00:55:40.708 --> 00:55:42.610
So, this is
the competition.

1172
00:55:43.978 --> 00:55:45.279
Nothing to worry about.

1173
00:55:45.313 --> 00:55:47.480
No. Things have changed.
We got a new coach.

1174
00:55:47.515 --> 00:55:49.617
Your coach is shit.
He's a failure.

1175
00:55:50.084 --> 00:55:52.854
He's just like you.

1176
00:55:52.887 --> 00:55:55.323
Obviously, you're trying
to get under our skin.

1177
00:55:55.355 --> 00:55:58.726
But American Samoan skin
is impenetrable. Okay?

1178
00:55:58.759 --> 00:56:01.361
Unless you got
a sharp object

1179
00:56:01.394 --> 00:56:06.033
like, um, scissors, um,
screwdriver, needle.

1180
00:56:06.067 --> 00:56:09.003
Anything that kind of
comes down to
a really sharp point.

1181
00:56:10.004 --> 00:56:11.839
See you at the party.

1182
00:56:11.873 --> 00:56:14.809
Don't forget to bring
your mascot.

1183
00:56:25.653 --> 00:56:28.289
"See you at the party later."
"See you
at the party later."

1184
00:56:28.322 --> 00:56:30.091
"See you at
the party later."

1185
00:56:30.124 --> 00:56:31.458
It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.

1186
00:56:32.392 --> 00:56:34.729
Oh, the glitz,
the glamour,

1187
00:56:34.762 --> 00:56:36.764
the little flowers
on the table!

1188
00:56:36.797 --> 00:56:38.165
Thomas,
isn't this wonderful?

1189
00:56:38.199 --> 00:56:41.501
Look, it's a veritable
who's that of world soccer.

1190
00:56:41.535 --> 00:56:44.338
Let's get out of here, T.
Hit the beach.

1191
00:56:44.372 --> 00:56:46.574
Six pack.
This isn't us.

1192
00:56:46.607 --> 00:56:48.609
We just got here.
The night's still young.

1193
00:56:48.643 --> 00:56:50.378
- Oh, shit.
- Hey!

1194
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:53.114
There he is.
There he is.
T! T!

1195
00:56:53.147 --> 00:56:55.316
Good day, mate.
Fancy
seeing you here.

1196
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:56.384
What's happening?
Hey! Hey!

1197
00:56:56.416 --> 00:56:57.518
Hi. All right.
Hi.

1198
00:56:57.551 --> 00:56:58.886
What's going on, huh?
Angus.

1199
00:56:58.920 --> 00:56:59.854
Hey!

1200
00:56:59.887 --> 00:57:01.389
Hey, give him
a bumming.
Give him a bumming.

1201
00:57:01.421 --> 00:57:03.124
Oh, yeah. Bumming!
Please.

1202
00:57:03.157 --> 00:57:05.660
That's enough!
That's enough!
There you go. Right-oh.

1203
00:57:05.693 --> 00:57:08.896
Settle down, mate.
It's good to see you.

1204
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:13.466
Tavita, this is,
uh, Angus, Keith.
Socceroos.

1205
00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:16.771
Oh, the Socceroos,
our arch nemesises.

1206
00:57:17.338 --> 00:57:19.240
Hey? What are you...?

1207
00:57:19.273 --> 00:57:20.440
Oh!

1208
00:57:20.473 --> 00:57:22.376
American Samoa.

1209
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:23.878
We played in that game.
We played in that game.

1210
00:57:23.911 --> 00:57:25.346
Yeah, show him
your tattoo.
Tattoo!

1211
00:57:25.379 --> 00:57:26.647
Show him the tattoo,
show him the tattoo.

1212
00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:27.815
Wait, wait.
He doesn't show

1213
00:57:27.848 --> 00:57:29.016
anyone this.
Let me show you
the tattoo.

1214
00:57:29.984 --> 00:57:32.353
Oh!

1215
00:57:32.386 --> 00:57:35.790
♪ <i>31, 31♪</i>
♪ <i>31, 31, 31♪</i>

1216
00:57:35.823 --> 00:57:38.092
Ah, mate,
we've moved on.
Put it away.

1217
00:57:38.125 --> 00:57:39.794
No, we haven't.
It's part of
our heritage.

1218
00:57:39.827 --> 00:57:41.461
I'm putting it away.
So, hey?

1219
00:57:41.494 --> 00:57:43.664
Coaching American Samoa.

1220
00:57:43.698 --> 00:57:45.366
Took the job
that nobody wanted.

1221
00:57:45.399 --> 00:57:46.434
He hasn't even been...
Right! Good on ya.

1222
00:57:46.466 --> 00:57:47.535
...fired yet.
Hey, no, but seriously,

1223
00:57:47.568 --> 00:57:49.236
how they going?
You having a few wins?

1224
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:50.438
Yeah.

1225
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:52.073
We're, you know,
we're...

1226
00:57:52.106 --> 00:57:54.275
Oi! A-Train.

1227
00:57:54.308 --> 00:57:56.043
- Toot toot!
- A-Train!

1228
00:57:56.644 --> 00:57:59.914
Hi.
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1229
00:57:59.947 --> 00:58:01.248
Oh. Oh.

1230
00:58:03.517 --> 00:58:05.920
You look good.
I missed you.

1231
00:58:05.953 --> 00:58:07.054
You look good.

1232
00:58:07.088 --> 00:58:08.222
Hey, there he is.

1233
00:58:08.255 --> 00:58:10.091
Hey.
Alex. Hey.

1234
00:58:10.124 --> 00:58:12.560
You're looking
kind of tired.
Yes, I was going to say

1235
00:58:12.593 --> 00:58:14.562
he's looking pretty tired,
isn't he?
Jet lag.

1236
00:58:14.595 --> 00:58:16.831
Thank you.
Um, Tavita,

1237
00:58:16.864 --> 00:58:19.934
I'd like
to introduce you
to Gail, my wife.

1238
00:58:19.967 --> 00:58:21.202
Separated.
Oh.

1239
00:58:21.235 --> 00:58:27.375
And this is Alex.
Uh, my boss
and Gail's manfriend.

1240
00:58:27.408 --> 00:58:30.411
Mr. Alex,
on behalf of FFAS,
we just want to thank you

1241
00:58:30.444 --> 00:58:31.679
for sending us
this super coach.

1242
00:58:31.712 --> 00:58:34.315
He's really
turned things around.

1243
00:58:34.348 --> 00:58:37.551
Great. Hey,
can I talk to you
real quick outside?

1244
00:58:37.585 --> 00:58:38.619
Sure.
He wants to have a word

1245
00:58:38.652 --> 00:58:40.154
with you outside.

1246
00:58:40.187 --> 00:58:41.255
It won't take a second.

1247
00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:04.011
Jaiyah!

1248
00:59:04.979 --> 00:59:07.048
Jaiyah!

1249
00:59:08.517 --> 00:59:12.853
Man. I got to say,
really proud of you.

1250
00:59:12.887 --> 00:59:15.556
We never thought
you'd make it.
Congrats.

1251
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:17.758
Thanks, Alex.
I mean, I don't know
what to say.

1252
00:59:17.792 --> 00:59:20.194
I'm so proud of what
we've done here.

1253
00:59:20.227 --> 00:59:21.862
Yeah. That's great.

1254
00:59:21.896 --> 00:59:23.631
Not that
it really matters
anymore.

1255
00:59:24.965 --> 00:59:26.333
What do you mean?

1256
00:59:26.367 --> 00:59:27.868
Don't worry about it.
It's just...

1257
00:59:28.736 --> 00:59:30.704
You have shown
real improvement

1258
00:59:30.738 --> 00:59:31.906
and that's what matters.

1259
00:59:31.939 --> 00:59:34.475
I'm going to find you
a real job after this.

1260
00:59:34.509 --> 00:59:35.843
Alex,
what are you saying?

1261
00:59:38.479 --> 00:59:40.181
Look, Thomas,
I once had this dog.

1262
00:59:40.214 --> 00:59:42.116
I know about the dog.
No, this is
a different dog.

1263
00:59:42.149 --> 00:59:44.218
You don't know this dog.
This dog was, uh,

1264
00:59:44.251 --> 00:59:45.486
this dog was
never any good.

1265
00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:46.921
He was slow
and he couldn't run,

1266
00:59:46.954 --> 00:59:49.190
and he never
caught a stick
or did anything

1267
00:59:49.223 --> 00:59:53.160
and so,
the kindest thing to do
was to put him down.

1268
00:59:54.028 --> 00:59:55.729
So, we killed him.
Shot him.

1269
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:58.799
The team is the dog?

1270
00:59:58.833 --> 01:00:01.135
Yeah, of course,
the team is the dog.
It's a metaphor.

1271
01:00:01.168 --> 01:00:03.938
How many dogs
do you think
I've killed?

1272
01:00:03.971 --> 01:00:09.176
Look, the herd
is only as fast
as its slowest animal.

1273
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:12.847
That's like
circle-of-life shit.

1274
01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.015
Well, I believe
we can score a goal.

1275
01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:17.685
A goal?
Who gives a shit
about a goal?

1276
01:00:17.718 --> 01:00:19.086
What if we win
the match?

1277
01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.788
Come on.

1278
01:00:20.821 --> 01:00:23.624
I don't think
they have a word
in their language for win.

1279
01:00:23.657 --> 01:00:27.695
Look, man. Soccer is
not in their DNA.
They're weak.

1280
01:00:27.728 --> 01:00:30.064
No, Alex.
They are not weak.

1281
01:00:30.097 --> 01:00:31.899
Some of the sacrifices
these players have made,

1282
01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:35.870
I mean, I'm talking about
life-altering sacrifices.

1283
01:00:35.903 --> 01:00:37.506
Look, I wish there was
something I could say

1284
01:00:37.539 --> 01:00:41.308
that would magically
make you feel better
about this. Oh...

1285
01:00:43.512 --> 01:00:44.712
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

1286
01:00:59.628 --> 01:01:00.661
<i>The biggest battle</i>

1287
01:01:00.694 --> 01:01:02.329
<i>of our professional lives</i>

1288
01:01:02.363 --> 01:01:04.031
<i>all comes down to today.</i>

1289
01:01:04.599 --> 01:01:05.833
<i>Now, either</i>

1290
01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:10.337
<i>we heal as a team</i>

1291
01:01:10.371 --> 01:01:13.040

1292
01:01:13.073 --> 01:01:17.077
<i>...inch by inch, play by play,</i>

1293
01:01:17.678 --> 01:01:19.380

1294
01:01:19.413 --> 01:01:21.583
<i>We can stay here,</i>

1295
01:01:21.616 --> 01:01:22.651
Hi.
Hey.

1296
01:01:22.683 --> 01:01:24.818
Nightcap?
Sure.

1297
01:01:24.852 --> 01:01:26.754
Let's go.
<i>We can fight</i>
<i>our way back...</i>

1298
01:01:26.787 --> 01:01:29.323
Oh, right.
<i>...into the light.</i>

1299
01:01:29.356 --> 01:01:31.292
<i>We can climb out of hell...</i>

1300
01:01:32.927 --> 01:01:34.695
You know,
I think island life

1301
01:01:34.728 --> 01:01:37.097
has had a real effect on me.

1302
01:01:37.131 --> 01:01:41.468
I feel like a new man.
Kind of Zen.

1303
01:01:41.502 --> 01:01:42.803
You seem the same.

1304
01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:45.206
Really?
Mm-hmm.

1305
01:01:45.239 --> 01:01:46.340
Are you happy?

1306
01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:48.008
I feel terrific.

1307
01:01:48.042 --> 01:01:49.810
Tomorrow, we're going
to lose the match.

1308
01:01:49.843 --> 01:01:51.178
Oh, come on.
And get kicked out

1309
01:01:51.212 --> 01:01:53.814
of International Football.
You don't really think that.

1310
01:01:53.847 --> 01:01:55.316
Pretty much the end
of my career.

1311
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:56.651
You're the best.

1312
01:01:56.685 --> 01:01:57.885
I'm a laughingstock.

1313
01:01:57.918 --> 01:01:59.621
You're a real buzzkill.

1314
01:01:59.654 --> 01:02:01.388
Oh, no.
Yeah.

1315
01:02:04.158 --> 01:02:05.459
This is fun.

1316
01:02:05.492 --> 01:02:06.794
This is fun.

1317
01:02:07.228 --> 01:02:08.395
I miss you.

1318
01:02:08.429 --> 01:02:09.797
I miss you too.

1319
01:02:10.497 --> 01:02:11.732
I love you.

1320
01:02:11.765 --> 01:02:14.468
You define love
as wanting
to be wanted.

1321
01:02:14.501 --> 01:02:16.103
You just don't want
to be alone.

1322
01:02:16.136 --> 01:02:19.006
Yeah? That's
the definition of love.

1323
01:02:20.609 --> 01:02:22.142
I'll always have
a broken heart,

1324
01:02:22.176 --> 01:02:23.210
but I'm moving.

1325
01:02:24.512 --> 01:02:25.946
Trying to move on.

1326
01:02:26.981 --> 01:02:28.550
It's been two years
and I don't think

1327
01:02:28.583 --> 01:02:30.184
you're even
talking about it.

1328
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.021
What's there
to talk about?

1329
01:02:38.158 --> 01:02:40.394
All right,
let's not talk then.

1330
01:02:40.427 --> 01:02:41.630
Come on, old man.

1331
01:02:41.663 --> 01:02:45.332
Oh, God.
Are we doing this?
Really?

1332
01:02:45.366 --> 01:02:46.500
Come on.
Okay.

1333
01:02:46.534 --> 01:02:47.868
I bet
you can't get it.

1334
01:02:47.901 --> 01:02:49.036
Well, you're supposed
to put it on the ground.

1335
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:50.771
It's called football.

1336
01:02:52.339 --> 01:02:53.274
Hey!

1337
01:02:53.307 --> 01:02:55.976
Don't tell me what to do.

1338
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:58.946
You have
a very fascinating
family dynamic, Thomas.

1339
01:02:58.979 --> 01:03:01.148
You know,
I saw this German film.

1340
01:03:01.181 --> 01:03:03.217
And they seemed to have
a similar arrangement.

1341
01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:07.154
You know, there was
this one woman
and all these guys.

1342
01:03:07.187 --> 01:03:09.823
I couldn't figure out
which one was married
to her

1343
01:03:09.857 --> 01:03:12.259
because they were
all acting like they were

1344
01:03:12.293 --> 01:03:13.961
- married to her.
- Lovely jogging.

1345
01:03:13.994 --> 01:03:15.296
Best one
I've seen yet.

1346
01:03:19.366 --> 01:03:20.467
Hey, it's Nicky!

1347
01:03:20.501 --> 01:03:23.470
Oh, Christmas
has come early.
It's Nicky Salapu!

1348
01:03:23.505 --> 01:03:24.773
Nicky Salapu!
Nicky!

1349
01:03:28.442 --> 01:03:29.778
Where did he come from?

1350
01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:30.944
Nicky Salapu.

1351
01:03:30.978 --> 01:03:32.212
Okay, okay.
Yes!

1352
01:03:32.246 --> 01:03:34.248
Guys, come on,
come on. Leave him alone.

1353
01:03:34.281 --> 01:03:35.517
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on,

1354
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.051
do your stretching.
Let's get
some breakfast,

1355
01:03:37.084 --> 01:03:38.886
and, uh, hydrate.
That way.

1356
01:03:38.919 --> 01:03:39.987
In that order.

1357
01:03:41.656 --> 01:03:42.890
You made it.

1358
01:03:42.923 --> 01:03:45.859
I guess, uh, my speech
actually had some effect?

1359
01:03:45.893 --> 01:03:47.828
Well, no.

1360
01:03:47.861 --> 01:03:49.897
Actually, I did some
research on you,
and it

1361
01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:52.399
turns out you're
a bigger loser
than I am.

1362
01:03:52.433 --> 01:03:56.136
Yeah, I mean, you've failed
so many times or been fired.

1363
01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:57.871
It actually makes me feel
better about being

1364
01:03:57.905 --> 01:03:59.406
the worst goalkeeper
in the world.

1365
01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.474
Oh.

1366
01:04:23.698 --> 01:04:25.065
American Samoa,

1367
01:04:25.099 --> 01:04:29.002
in a few hours we will see you
on the field with Tonga!

1368
01:04:29.036 --> 01:04:31.372
- Tonga!
- Tonga!

1369
01:04:31.405 --> 01:04:35.909
Tonga, in a few hours,
you meet American Samoa

1370
01:04:36.944 --> 01:04:38.345
on the field.

1371
01:04:38.879 --> 01:04:40.582
Also.

1372
01:04:46.987 --> 01:04:48.656
Tonga! Move it out!

1373
01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:55.963
All right, guys.
They're scared.

1374
01:04:58.499 --> 01:05:00.602
<i>Welcome</i>
<i>to today's World Cup</i>

1375
01:05:00.635 --> 01:05:04.606
<i>qualifying match between Tonga</i>
<i>and American Samoa.</i>

1376
01:05:04.639 --> 01:05:05.673
Thank you.

1377
01:05:06.206 --> 01:05:07.207
Thank you.

1378
01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:08.877
Here's your seat, darling.
Here's your seat.

1379
01:05:08.909 --> 01:05:12.079
Hi, fellas.
Alligator!
How are ya?

1380
01:05:17.184 --> 01:05:18.686
Don't know what
to say, really.

1381
01:05:19.754 --> 01:05:23.023
A few minutes
to the biggest battle

1382
01:05:23.056 --> 01:05:24.491
of our professional lives.

1383
01:05:25.159 --> 01:05:26.594
All comes down
to today.

1384
01:05:28.696 --> 01:05:31.699
Now, either we heal
as a team.

1385
01:05:33.066 --> 01:05:36.437
Or we're going
to crumble,
inch by inch,

1386
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:39.072
play by play,
till we're finished.

1387
01:05:39.106 --> 01:05:41.876
Hang on.
That's the <i>Any Given</i>
<i>Sunday</i> speech.

1388
01:05:44.344 --> 01:05:45.647
No, Daru.

1389
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:50.384
So, I'd like you to see
this space as a safe space

1390
01:05:50.417 --> 01:05:52.319
where you can share
your stories,

1391
01:05:52.352 --> 01:05:55.088
your thoughts,
hopes and dreams.

1392
01:05:56.524 --> 01:05:58.125
So, please. Anyone.

1393
01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:06.033
Hey, what's up,
everybody?
It's me, Smiley.

1394
01:06:06.066 --> 01:06:07.334
Hey, Smiley.

1395
01:06:07.367 --> 01:06:09.737
Um, it's funny you guys
call me Smiley.

1396
01:06:09.771 --> 01:06:10.971
I don't really
smile much

1397
01:06:11.004 --> 01:06:12.674
outside of
this place.

1398
01:06:14.208 --> 01:06:15.309
As some of you
may know,

1399
01:06:15.342 --> 01:06:17.978
I had a pretty rough year
this past year

1400
01:06:18.011 --> 01:06:20.347
after both my parents
got arrested for...

1401
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.583
Let's go, guys,
time to play.

1402
01:06:23.183 --> 01:06:25.252
Another time,
Smiley.

1403
01:06:25.285 --> 01:06:27.421
Okay, guys, we've done
the hard work.

1404
01:06:27.454 --> 01:06:29.256
Let's do this!

1405
01:06:29.289 --> 01:06:31.391
Wait a minute,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1406
01:06:31.425 --> 01:06:32.359
Where's Jaiyah?

1407
01:06:32.392 --> 01:06:34.995
Jaiyah, where is she?

1408
01:06:35.028 --> 01:06:36.230
Where's Jaiyah?

1409
01:06:43.638 --> 01:06:45.339
Jaiyah! What's going on?

1410
01:06:45.372 --> 01:06:47.074
Go away, coach.

1411
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:50.077
- What's wrong?
- I just...

1412
01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:54.181
You know what?
Pregame nerves.
Totally normal.

1413
01:06:54.782 --> 01:06:56.751
Pregame nerves.

1414
01:06:56.784 --> 01:06:59.052
Everybody gets them.
Hey, hey, hey,

1415
01:06:59.086 --> 01:07:01.088
come on, come on.
Oi, hey, hey.

1416
01:07:01.121 --> 01:07:03.725
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1417
01:07:04.626 --> 01:07:06.761
What is it?
Hey, talk to me.

1418
01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:11.498
I went off my hormones.

1419
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.235
I went off my hormones
so I could perform better.

1420
01:07:15.837 --> 01:07:17.437
For you and for the boys.

1421
01:07:17.471 --> 01:07:19.306
And now I don't feel
like myself.

1422
01:07:19.339 --> 01:07:22.644
I feel ugly.
And everyone
knows it. And...

1423
01:07:22.677 --> 01:07:24.044
I feel crazy.

1424
01:07:24.077 --> 01:07:27.114
And I can't do this,
coach, I can't.

1425
01:07:27.147 --> 01:07:29.617
Hey, hey?

1426
01:07:29.651 --> 01:07:31.920
Look at me.
Keep your head up,
keep your head up.

1427
01:07:31.953 --> 01:07:34.421
Come on,
keep your head up.
Be proud.

1428
01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:36.591
You inspire
those players in there.

1429
01:07:37.224 --> 01:07:38.626
I can't inspire them.

1430
01:07:39.159 --> 01:07:40.595
I need your help.

1431
01:07:43.096 --> 01:07:44.532
They're not going
to follow me.

1432
01:07:46.066 --> 01:07:47.535
But they will follow you.

1433
01:07:49.837 --> 01:07:51.405
Will you do me a favor,

1434
01:07:51.438 --> 01:07:53.373
and lead them out
onto the pitch?

1435
01:08:03.985 --> 01:08:05.185
Yeah?

1436
01:08:05.954 --> 01:08:07.454
Come on. Up you get.

1437
01:08:10.223 --> 01:08:12.292
Let's get you ready.

1438
01:08:12.326 --> 01:08:16.496
Okay, right. Let's fix
your hair, here.

1439
01:08:17.197 --> 01:08:19.299
Yeah. That's nice.

1440
01:08:19.333 --> 01:08:23.203
Yeah,
that looks terrible.
It's kind of nice.

1441
01:08:23.236 --> 01:08:25.238
It's the way
I used to do
my daughter's hair.

1442
01:08:25.272 --> 01:08:26.874
She liked it.

1443
01:08:26.908 --> 01:08:28.543
Well, she was
probably lying to you.

1444
01:08:29.544 --> 01:08:30.545
Very possible.

1445
01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.781
You okay?
I'm okay.

1446
01:08:33.815 --> 01:08:34.816
Okay.

1447
01:08:36.851 --> 01:08:38.118
I'll see you
out there.

1448
01:09:25.533 --> 01:09:27.101
American Samoa!

1449
01:10:31.799 --> 01:10:34.569
Hey, boss. I got these
made up for us.

1450
01:10:34.602 --> 01:10:35.703
For you and me.

1451
01:10:35.737 --> 01:10:39.306
The two Miyagis.
Yeah. Two Miyagis.

1452
01:10:40.307 --> 01:10:42.242
Shh, shh, shh!

1453
01:10:42.275 --> 01:10:43.544
Hey, hey, hey.

1454
01:10:43.578 --> 01:10:45.012
It's starting,
it's starting. Shh.

1455
01:10:47.347 --> 01:10:48.983
I'm embarrassed
already.

1456
01:11:00.027 --> 01:11:01.696
Let's go, boys.

1457
01:11:08.069 --> 01:11:10.138
Excellent.
Yes, Jaiyah.

1458
01:11:10.171 --> 01:11:11.806
Open it, give him
some space.

1459
01:11:14.175 --> 01:11:15.275
Go, Jonah!
Hit it!

1460
01:11:15.308 --> 01:11:17.779
- Go, Jonah!
- Kick it!

1461
01:11:20.681 --> 01:11:22.315
This close.
It was this close.

1462
01:11:22.349 --> 01:11:24.317
Here we go again.

1463
01:11:25.219 --> 01:11:26.821
Watch, watch, watch.

1464
01:11:26.854 --> 01:11:27.922
I got him! I got him!

1465
01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:29.157
Go, Daru!

1466
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:30.825
Daru,
stay on your feet!

1467
01:11:30.858 --> 01:11:31.893
Stay on your feet!

1468
01:11:33.161 --> 01:11:35.530
- Hold that back line.
- Yeah.

1469
01:11:35.563 --> 01:11:37.865
Squeeze him, Jaiyah!
Don't let him roll you.

1470
01:11:39.801 --> 01:11:41.035
Come out, Nicky!

1471
01:11:41.068 --> 01:11:42.502
Come on, Nicky,
you can do it!

1472
01:11:43.271 --> 01:11:44.806
Good, good.

1473
01:11:44.839 --> 01:11:46.174
That's it.

1474
01:11:46.207 --> 01:11:48.509
Jaiyah! Don't let him
roll you like that.

1475
01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:50.711
It's okay.

1476
01:11:52.547 --> 01:11:54.982
Guys, guys! Go, go, go!

1477
01:11:55.016 --> 01:11:56.951
Pass it off! Pass it off!

1478
01:11:56.984 --> 01:11:59.654
Find the player.
Come on, Samson.

1479
01:11:59.687 --> 01:12:01.255
- Samson!
- Hunt him down.

1480
01:12:01.289 --> 01:12:03.456
First try, Jonah.
First try!

1481
01:12:07.261 --> 01:12:08.729
Not your day,
mate.

1482
01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:10.330
Shut up!

1483
01:12:10.363 --> 01:12:11.732
Don't get fired,
mate.

1484
01:12:11.766 --> 01:12:13.868
Get back, back, back!
Back!

1485
01:12:15.102 --> 01:12:16.403
Come on, come on,
come on.

1486
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:18.606
Beat him to it.

1487
01:12:20.508 --> 01:12:23.410
Daru, what was that?
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1488
01:12:23.443 --> 01:12:24.912
- Come on!
- Bring it in!

1489
01:12:24.946 --> 01:12:26.346
Bring it in. Come on.

1490
01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.051
Rambo, switch with Vegas.
Daru, be careful.

1491
01:12:30.084 --> 01:12:31.786
Nicole,
I need you to...
Nicole?

1492
01:12:31.819 --> 01:12:34.689
Jaiyah, I need you
to control
that back line.

1493
01:12:34.722 --> 01:12:36.456
You have
to communicate!

1494
01:12:36.489 --> 01:12:38.960
Now, I made you captain.
Now own it. Let's go!

1495
01:12:38.993 --> 01:12:40.061
Okay, coach.
Come on, team!

1496
01:12:40.094 --> 01:12:41.195
Let's go, team!

1497
01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:42.429
Let's go, team!

1498
01:12:47.668 --> 01:12:50.370
Keep going.

1499
01:12:50.403 --> 01:12:52.306
Go. Pass, pass.
Pass.

1500
01:12:54.575 --> 01:12:57.945
Pass it. Support him.
What the...

1501
01:12:59.313 --> 01:13:01.414
Coach.
Okay.

1502
01:13:07.121 --> 01:13:08.356
Shit!

1503
01:13:11.491 --> 01:13:15.096
Jaiyah,
hold that back line!
Where are you going?

1504
01:13:25.907 --> 01:13:27.508
Ah! Shit.

1505
01:13:33.547 --> 01:13:35.082
Let's go, Rambo.
Come on.

1506
01:13:53.701 --> 01:13:56.037
<i>- Goal!</i>
- No!

1507
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:57.838
Oh, shit! Fuck!

1508
01:14:04.712 --> 01:14:06.380
<i>And that's halftime.</i>

1509
01:14:06.414 --> 01:14:09.216
<i>Tonga takes a one nil lead</i>
<i>into the half.</i>

1510
01:14:33.607 --> 01:14:34.842
Shut up!

1511
01:14:35.443 --> 01:14:36.711
Sit down!

1512
01:14:38.379 --> 01:14:40.448
What the hell is
going on out there?

1513
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.083
What about all the training?

1514
01:14:42.116 --> 01:14:44.218
This is bullshit.

1515
01:14:44.251 --> 01:14:47.855
I would've killed
to play international soccer.

1516
01:14:47.888 --> 01:14:50.858
But you losers don't seem
to give two shits.

1517
01:14:50.891 --> 01:14:52.059
You're losers!

1518
01:14:53.194 --> 01:14:54.261
I'm sorry, coach.

1519
01:14:55.296 --> 01:14:56.564
We're just
not feeling it.

1520
01:14:56.597 --> 01:14:58.766
"Sorry, coach.
I'm just not feeling it."

1521
01:14:58.799 --> 01:15:01.869
What does that mean,
"not feeling it"?
Nothing!

1522
01:15:01.902 --> 01:15:03.838
It does mean something,
Thomas.

1523
01:15:03.871 --> 01:15:06.073
Feeling is
very important
to us.

1524
01:15:06.107 --> 01:15:07.908
It's not that
we've forgotten
what you have taught us.

1525
01:15:07.942 --> 01:15:11.045
It's... it's just that
we've taken
too much to heart.

1526
01:15:11.078 --> 01:15:13.848
It's too tense.
We keep thinking
we might win.

1527
01:15:14.615 --> 01:15:15.950
We've never fought
like that before.

1528
01:15:15.983 --> 01:15:17.885
Well, don't worry.
Because that's
not gonna happen

1529
01:15:17.918 --> 01:15:19.587
the way you're playing.
Trust me.

1530
01:15:28.329 --> 01:15:30.231
Yeah. Ah, Samson says

1531
01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:32.299
the guys are really
stressed out.

1532
01:15:32.333 --> 01:15:33.667
And stress
is a silent killer.

1533
01:15:33.701 --> 01:15:34.735
It's like when
the Predator...

1534
01:15:34.769 --> 01:15:37.038
- Really?
- Yeah.

1535
01:15:37.071 --> 01:15:40.241
Great. Perfect.
I give up.
Sick of this shit.

1536
01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:42.610
Good luck.

1537
01:15:49.216 --> 01:15:52.420
Mr. Rongen?
Mr. Rongen.

1538
01:15:52.453 --> 01:15:55.456
What? What do you want
from me, Tavita?

1539
01:15:55.489 --> 01:15:57.625
Look, I like you.
But I'm done.

1540
01:15:57.658 --> 01:15:58.893
I got to get off
this island.

1541
01:15:58.926 --> 01:16:00.027
And you're not going
to change my mind

1542
01:16:00.061 --> 01:16:02.129
with any stories
of marinated fish.

1543
01:16:02.163 --> 01:16:04.698
I'm not here to talk
about marinated fish.

1544
01:16:04.732 --> 01:16:06.535
But I want you
to be happy.

1545
01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:09.236
I'm not happy.
I'm not a happy person.

1546
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:10.237
And I hate
to break it to you,

1547
01:16:10.271 --> 01:16:12.273
but you're not going
to get your "one goal."

1548
01:16:13.107 --> 01:16:14.008
That's all right.

1549
01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:16.677
I'm kind of used to that
by now, Mr. Rongen.

1550
01:16:16.710 --> 01:16:18.012
It's not my fault, man.
I tried.

1551
01:16:18.045 --> 01:16:19.514
I know, I know.
They don't listen to me.

1552
01:16:19.548 --> 01:16:20.781
I know.
It's over!

1553
01:16:20.815 --> 01:16:23.584
They're shutting you down.
Oh. That I did not know.

1554
01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.788
That will be
why Mr. Alex is here.

1555
01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:32.460
Oh, well.

1556
01:16:32.493 --> 01:16:33.727
On the bright side,

1557
01:16:33.761 --> 01:16:36.497
I got to go
on a tropical island getaway.

1558
01:16:36.531 --> 01:16:39.100
Take in the sights
with my friend, Thomas.

1559
01:16:40.201 --> 01:16:41.235
What is it with you?

1560
01:16:42.036 --> 01:16:43.737
Why are you always
so positive?

1561
01:16:43.771 --> 01:16:45.639
It's sickening.

1562
01:16:45.673 --> 01:16:47.608
You should coach them.
They believe in you.

1563
01:16:47.641 --> 01:16:48.776
They believe in you.

1564
01:16:48.809 --> 01:16:50.711
But you have to show them
who you are.

1565
01:16:50.744 --> 01:16:52.913
They don't know you.
You don't talk to them.

1566
01:16:52.947 --> 01:16:54.715
Ever since you got
to our island,

1567
01:16:54.748 --> 01:16:55.950
you've been
somewhere else.

1568
01:16:55.983 --> 01:16:57.818
Even now,
you're somewhere else.

1569
01:16:57.852 --> 01:16:58.919
Maybe it's in the past,

1570
01:16:58.953 --> 01:17:01.088
because you thought
you were happier then.

1571
01:17:01.122 --> 01:17:04.058
But I think you could
be happy here, now.

1572
01:17:04.091 --> 01:17:06.060
But you actually have
to be here, now.

1573
01:17:09.029 --> 01:17:10.030
I can't win.

1574
01:17:11.065 --> 01:17:12.066
Then lose.

1575
01:17:13.901 --> 01:17:15.302
But don't lose alone.

1576
01:17:16.237 --> 01:17:17.404
Lose with us.

1577
01:17:18.806 --> 01:17:20.374
And there's always
the second half.

1578
01:17:21.442 --> 01:17:22.810
That's another chance.

1579
01:17:24.678 --> 01:17:26.347
Second halves
everywhere.

1580
01:17:42.496 --> 01:17:44.698
Right.
Get rid of it.

1581
01:17:44.732 --> 01:17:46.267
This is all nonsense.

1582
01:18:02.584 --> 01:18:04.752
Mmm. Okay.

1583
01:18:06.187 --> 01:18:08.889
Shouldn't have, uh,
called you losers.

1584
01:18:08.923 --> 01:18:11.292
Um, it's not true.
You're not.

1585
01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:14.461
I'm the loser.

1586
01:18:17.998 --> 01:18:20.602
So,
two years ago,

1587
01:18:20.635 --> 01:18:23.170
I lost my daughter
in a car accident.

1588
01:18:23.204 --> 01:18:24.371
Her name was Nicole.

1589
01:18:27.308 --> 01:18:28.375
And that's her hat.

1590
01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:33.981
She was the greatest,
you know.

1591
01:18:34.014 --> 01:18:37.451
She was, um,
bright and funny,
and, uh,

1592
01:18:37.484 --> 01:18:40.020
she loved soccer.
She loved it.

1593
01:18:42.557 --> 01:18:44.758
We used to sit up
and talk about the game.

1594
01:18:44.792 --> 01:18:45.993
Most nights.

1595
01:18:47.328 --> 01:18:48.896
And then, uh,

1596
01:18:48.929 --> 01:18:50.599
one day, she was
on her way to practice

1597
01:18:50.632 --> 01:18:53.100
and she lost control
and crashed.

1598
01:18:53.767 --> 01:18:54.969
That was it.

1599
01:18:55.769 --> 01:18:56.971
She was gone.

1600
01:18:58.707 --> 01:19:00.107
I lost my baby.

1601
01:19:00.741 --> 01:19:02.510
Sorry. Okay.

1602
01:19:04.613 --> 01:19:06.847
I guess, I got pretty angry
at the world

1603
01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.718
but mainly, I was angry
at myself. Maybe...

1604
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:13.020
if I took her to practice,
she'd still be here.

1605
01:19:13.053 --> 01:19:15.956
Maybe if I was there
for her a bit more.

1606
01:19:16.357 --> 01:19:17.424
A lot of maybes.

1607
01:19:20.294 --> 01:19:21.630
Why'd I take this job?

1608
01:19:21.663 --> 01:19:23.565
For the challenge? No.

1609
01:19:23.598 --> 01:19:24.699
I couldn't give two shits

1610
01:19:24.733 --> 01:19:25.766
about turning
this team around.

1611
01:19:25.799 --> 01:19:28.536
I was, uh, forced
to take it.

1612
01:19:29.503 --> 01:19:31.606
It was the only job
I could get.

1613
01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.141
And I didn't want it, guys.

1614
01:19:34.174 --> 01:19:36.544
You know, I thought
I was better than you.

1615
01:19:39.346 --> 01:19:43.317
And fact of the matter is,
you don't need me at all.

1616
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:44.785
You're already perfect.

1617
01:19:46.287 --> 01:19:49.490
So basically, my advice
to you would be,

1618
01:19:49.524 --> 01:19:50.525
"Don't listen to me."

1619
01:19:51.825 --> 01:19:54.428
Go out there
and do what you do.

1620
01:19:54.461 --> 01:19:56.531
Or don't do it.

1621
01:19:56.564 --> 01:19:58.499
Whatever. You know?

1622
01:19:59.233 --> 01:20:00.267
You've reminded me

1623
01:20:00.301 --> 01:20:03.237
that I've always loved playing
more than winning.

1624
01:20:03.804 --> 01:20:06.040
So, enjoy this match.

1625
01:20:06.073 --> 01:20:08.275
I mean, life's short.
Football's a game.

1626
01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:11.145
I just want you all
to be happy.

1627
01:20:14.549 --> 01:20:16.150
But we want
to win, coach.

1628
01:20:18.452 --> 01:20:19.820
Then be happy.

1629
01:21:39.366 --> 01:21:41.402
Coach, nice pep talk.

1630
01:22:11.498 --> 01:22:15.135
Hey, Chief, got any
spare chicken, there?

1631
01:22:21.175 --> 01:22:22.677
No pressure.

1632
01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:24.011
Enjoy yourselves.

1633
01:22:24.044 --> 01:22:25.245
It's just a game.

1634
01:22:27.481 --> 01:22:28.817
Life is good.

1635
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:30.552
Yes, Jaiyah. Yeah.

1636
01:22:31.686 --> 01:22:32.887
Oh, good kicking!

1637
01:22:32.921 --> 01:22:34.188
Push up, push up, push up.

1638
01:22:35.088 --> 01:22:36.290
Look for it.

1639
01:23:29.109 --> 01:23:32.514
<i>Goal!</i>
Yeah!

1640
01:23:32.547 --> 01:23:34.549
Yeah!

1641
01:23:37.117 --> 01:23:39.721
We scored a goal!
We scored a goal!

1642
01:23:39.754 --> 01:23:41.623
We actually
scored a goal!

1643
01:23:48.095 --> 01:23:49.831
That's my boy!
That's my boy!

1644
01:23:49.864 --> 01:23:53.568
<i>This is the first goal ever</i>
<i>for American Samoa.</i>

1645
01:23:53.601 --> 01:23:54.969
Let's go,
Samoa!

1646
01:23:55.003 --> 01:23:58.205
My baby!
Rambo did it, you guys.

1647
01:23:58.238 --> 01:23:59.707
<i>What a match!</i>

1648
01:24:02.677 --> 01:24:03.811
Wow!

1649
01:24:12.386 --> 01:24:16.156
Whoa, no, no, no.
Whoa. Somebody!

1650
01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:18.860
Darling! Darling!

1651
01:24:18.893 --> 01:24:19.994
Oh, no!

1652
01:24:20.028 --> 01:24:22.564
Help!
Somebody.

1653
01:24:22.597 --> 01:24:24.398
I need
medical assistance
over in section...

1654
01:24:26.233 --> 01:24:30.337
Hey, Ma. Dad.
Dad. Wake up.

1655
01:24:30.972 --> 01:24:33.073
Dad, it's me. Dad?

1656
01:24:33.106 --> 01:24:35.175
- No, no, no. Okay, okay.
- Hey, hey.

1657
01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:36.343
Calm down. Calm down.

1658
01:24:36.376 --> 01:24:38.278
What happened?

1659
01:24:38.312 --> 01:24:40.715
They said I suffered
a massive stroke.

1660
01:24:40.748 --> 01:24:42.182
Heat stroke.

1661
01:24:42.215 --> 01:24:44.117
Yeah, a massive heat stroke.

1662
01:24:44.151 --> 01:24:45.252
It was awful, son.

1663
01:24:45.285 --> 01:24:46.821
Scary for
everyone involved.

1664
01:24:46.854 --> 01:24:49.757
But in time,
maybe even an hour,

1665
01:24:50.592 --> 01:24:52.326
I think I'll be up
on my feet again.

1666
01:24:52.359 --> 01:24:53.393
Okay, you're going
to be okay.

1667
01:24:53.427 --> 01:24:54.796
How much did we lose by?
10-one?

1668
01:24:54.829 --> 01:24:56.163
What was the final score?
Calm down, Dad. Okay?

1669
01:24:56.196 --> 01:24:58.465
Breathe in. Out.

1670
01:24:58.498 --> 01:25:00.367
I'm ready, I'm ready, okay?
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
Calm down.

1671
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.936
Tell me what happened.
Calm down. You calm?

1672
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:03.071
Okay. Yeah. Go.

1673
01:25:03.103 --> 01:25:04.072
Now I'm going to tell you
what happened.

1674
01:25:04.104 --> 01:25:05.640
Tell me what happened.
All right.

1675
01:25:07.341 --> 01:25:09.142
<i>Possession kept going</i>
<i>back and forth.</i>

1676
01:25:09.711 --> 01:25:11.012
<i>And things were tense.</i>

1677
01:25:11.045 --> 01:25:13.514
<i>Because we knew</i>
<i>the whole country</i>
<i>was watching.</i>

1678
01:25:14.782 --> 01:25:17.018
<i>And that people would talk</i>
<i>about this day</i>

1679
01:25:17.051 --> 01:25:18.586
<i>for years to come.</i>

1680
01:25:19.988 --> 01:25:21.522
<i>And then Tonga broke</i>
<i>with the ball.</i>

1681
01:25:21.556 --> 01:25:23.357
I got him!
<i>It was a one-on-one</i>

1682
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:25.225
<i>between me and Alishe</i>
<i>and I thought</i>
<i>I could take the ball.</i>

1683
01:25:25.258 --> 01:25:26.661
<i>But if I dived in and missed,</i>

1684
01:25:26.694 --> 01:25:28.195
there was going
to be a certain goal.

1685
01:25:29.296 --> 01:25:30.698
<i>But it was different.</i>

1686
01:25:30.732 --> 01:25:31.733
I felt different.

1687
01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:33.768
<i>I stood up</i>

1688
01:25:35.135 --> 01:25:36.269
<i>and I tackled him.</i>

1689
01:25:37.972 --> 01:25:39.406
<i>Suddenly, we're on the attack.</i>

1690
01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.442
<i>I played the ball up to Vegas.</i>

1691
01:25:42.476 --> 01:25:44.012
He saw the keeper
out of position and

1692
01:25:44.045 --> 01:25:45.847
<i>he shot with</i>
<i>his almighty power.</i>

1693
01:25:49.517 --> 01:25:50.450
<i>But the keeper</i>

1694
01:25:50.484 --> 01:25:52.486
saved and scrambled it
behind for a corner.

1695
01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.989
Yes! This is it,
this is it.

1696
01:25:55.023 --> 01:25:56.456
Jaiyah!

1697
01:25:56.490 --> 01:25:58.526
Get up.

1698
01:25:58.559 --> 01:26:00.662
<i>In the box</i>
<i>there was</i>
<i>a lot of tussling,</i>

1699
01:26:00.695 --> 01:26:02.362
<i>and things were</i>
<i>getting serious.</i>

1700
01:26:03.031 --> 01:26:04.431
<i>Deph took the corner.</i>

1701
01:26:06.134 --> 01:26:08.569
<i>It was a right-footed</i>
<i>in-swinger.</i>

1702
01:26:08.603 --> 01:26:10.838
<i>It looked like Tonga</i>
<i>would clear.</i>

1703
01:26:10.872 --> 01:26:12.305
But then...

1704
01:26:12.974 --> 01:26:14.274
<i>Jaiyah.</i>

1705
01:26:20.715 --> 01:26:21.816
Goal.

1706
01:26:22.116 --> 01:26:23.151
Yeah!

1707
01:26:26.654 --> 01:26:28.923
That's what
I'm talking about, boy.

1708
01:26:28.956 --> 01:26:30.658
Goal!

1709
01:26:30.692 --> 01:26:32.660
<i>And another historic goal!</i>

1710
01:26:35.362 --> 01:26:37.965
<i>Unbelievable!</i>
<i>American Samoa...</i>

1711
01:26:37.999 --> 01:26:39.332
Yes!

1712
01:26:39.366 --> 01:26:40.200
<i>...the last-ranked team</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

1713
01:26:40.233 --> 01:26:41.736
<i>might actually win this thing!</i>

1714
01:26:42.704 --> 01:26:43.604
We scored?
Yeah.

1715
01:26:43.638 --> 01:26:45.640
A goal? An actual goal?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1716
01:26:45.673 --> 01:26:46.574
Another one?

1717
01:26:46.607 --> 01:26:48.009
Okay.
Did you hear that? Two!

1718
01:26:48.042 --> 01:26:50.410
Everything was going great.
With only 30 seconds left

1719
01:26:50.444 --> 01:26:52.080
<i>on the clock.</i>
<i>We were winning.</i>

1720
01:26:52.113 --> 01:26:53.480
<i>But then the referee</i>
<i>decided to add</i>

1721
01:26:53.514 --> 01:26:54.849
five minutes
to the game.

1722
01:26:54.882 --> 01:26:56.117
What a disgrace.
Yeah.

1723
01:26:56.150 --> 01:26:57.185
Then what happened?

1724
01:26:57.217 --> 01:26:58.418
<i>The match</i>
<i>was almost over.</i>

1725
01:26:58.452 --> 01:26:59.987
<i>We were holding up</i>
<i>under the pressure.</i>

1726
01:27:05.793 --> 01:27:06.794
Got it!

1727
01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.830
Stop, thief!

1728
01:27:08.863 --> 01:27:11.498
You can only get away
with one of those a game.

1729
01:27:11.532 --> 01:27:13.500
The ball was passed wide
and the Tonga winger

1730
01:27:13.534 --> 01:27:15.402
<i>sent over a great cross.</i>

1731
01:27:16.671 --> 01:27:18.371
<i>Nicky was catching these</i>
<i>all day,</i>

1732
01:27:18.405 --> 01:27:20.007
<i>but under the pressure...</i>

1733
01:27:22.043 --> 01:27:23.410
<i>...he fumbled it.</i>

1734
01:27:23.443 --> 01:27:25.378
<i>It hit his hand and it was</i>
<i>rolling towards the goal.</i>

1735
01:27:26.614 --> 01:27:27.949
- Oh, shit.
<i>- Then,</i>

1736
01:27:27.982 --> 01:27:28.983
out of nowhere

1737
01:27:29.617 --> 01:27:30.551
<i>came Jaiyah.</i>

1738
01:27:30.585 --> 01:27:32.319
<i>She slid in at the last minute</i>
<i>and hooked</i>

1739
01:27:32.352 --> 01:27:34.421
<i>the ball off the line,</i>
<i>saving a certain goal.</i>

1740
01:27:34.454 --> 01:27:36.256
Yes, Jaiyah! Yes!

1741
01:27:36.824 --> 01:27:37.925
But then,

1742
01:27:37.959 --> 01:27:39.426
<i>the ball fell to Alishe</i>

1743
01:27:39.459 --> 01:27:41.095
<i>and he wasn't going to miss.</i>

1744
01:27:41.129 --> 01:27:42.630
<i>I didn't have any option.</i>

1745
01:27:42.663 --> 01:27:44.732
<i>As he drew back to shoot,</i>
<i>I dived in.</i>

1746
01:27:46.234 --> 01:27:48.569
<i>Clear penalty.</i>
<i>It was my fault.</i>

1747
01:27:48.603 --> 01:27:51.404
Hit him, darling.

1748
01:27:52.472 --> 01:27:54.609
You idiot!
Then what happened?

1749
01:27:54.642 --> 01:27:57.078
Nicky Salapu had to face
the penalty by himself.

1750
01:27:57.111 --> 01:27:59.046
- Oh, Jesus, it gets worse.
- Oh, God.

1751
01:28:06.286 --> 01:28:08.388
"I had been
catching these
all day.

1752
01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:10.691
<i>"It was my time."</i>

1753
01:28:10.725 --> 01:28:12.927
<i>Everything was</i>
<i>on the line.</i>

1754
01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.427
Oh, the pressure!

1755
01:28:14.461 --> 01:28:15.596
Yeah. He was
under pressure.
Oh, pressure.

1756
01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:16.798
Absolutely.
Pressure.
Oh! Pressure cooker.

1757
01:28:16.831 --> 01:28:18.166
- Come on, Nicky.
- Go, Nicky.

1758
01:28:18.199 --> 01:28:19.332
- Let's go, Nicky!
- Let's go!

1759
01:28:21.269 --> 01:28:23.403
- Let's go, Nicky.
<i>- Don't tell me</i>

1760
01:28:23.436 --> 01:28:25.540
Nicky Salapu had
a meltdown in goal?

1761
01:28:25.573 --> 01:28:27.474
<i>The horror of those</i>
<i>31 goals against</i>

1762
01:28:27.508 --> 01:28:28.609
<i>Australia 10 years ago</i>

1763
01:28:28.643 --> 01:28:30.011
<i>came back and haunted him.</i>

1764
01:28:34.381 --> 01:28:36.818
<i>I suppose he lost</i>
<i>his composure</i>

1765
01:28:36.851 --> 01:28:38.519
<i>and just stepped aside</i>
<i>and let the ball go in.</i>

1766
01:28:38.553 --> 01:28:40.121
<i>Damn everyone watching!</i>

1767
01:28:40.154 --> 01:28:41.622
Is that what happened?

1768
01:28:41.656 --> 01:28:43.356
He probably was
freaking out a bit.

1769
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:45.159
"But I wasn't
freaking out."

1770
01:28:45.193 --> 01:28:47.261
<i>Nicky wasn't freaking out</i>

1771
01:28:47.295 --> 01:28:49.297
because he knew
he had the history

1772
01:28:49.329 --> 01:28:51.699
of a thousand chiefs
holding him up.

1773
01:28:51.732 --> 01:28:54.202
But he just had to
let go of everything.

1774
01:28:54.235 --> 01:28:55.468
"The past."

1775
01:28:57.271 --> 01:28:58.573
<i>The present.</i>

1776
01:28:59.372 --> 01:29:00.708
<i>"The future.</i>

1777
01:29:01.474 --> 01:29:02.810
"But I had
to let it go.

1778
01:29:04.912 --> 01:29:06.013
" <i>All of it."</i>

1779
01:29:06.714 --> 01:29:09.584
He just had
to become Nicky.

1780
01:29:09.617 --> 01:29:12.854
I'm Nicky Salapu.
Say it.

1781
01:29:13.486 --> 01:29:15.089
I'm Nicky Salapu.

1782
01:29:39.647 --> 01:29:41.048
<i>The whistle blew.</i>

1783
01:29:41.082 --> 01:29:44.552
<i>For a second, we didn't know</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

1784
01:29:44.585 --> 01:29:46.921
<i>We never felt</i>
<i>like this before.</i>

1785
01:29:46.954 --> 01:29:49.456
Until we'd realized...

1786
01:29:49.489 --> 01:29:51.025
<i>With a final score</i>
<i>of two-to-one,</i>

1787
01:29:51.058 --> 01:29:52.526
<i>American Samoa...</i>

1788
01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.963
We win! We won!
We won! We won!

1789
01:29:58.132 --> 01:29:59.600
Yeah!

1790
01:30:07.407 --> 01:30:09.442
<i>American Samoa wins its</i>

1791
01:30:09.476 --> 01:30:11.646
<i>first match ever!</i>

1792
01:30:25.159 --> 01:30:26.160
We did this!

1793
01:30:29.263 --> 01:30:30.998
All right!

1794
01:30:46.614 --> 01:30:47.882
We won?
We won?

1795
01:30:47.915 --> 01:30:50.184
We won. You won
a game, Dad.
What?

1796
01:30:50.217 --> 01:30:52.153
Yes, Jesus, we won!
Oh, we won!

1797
01:30:52.186 --> 01:30:53.287
Yes!

1798
01:30:53.321 --> 01:30:54.689
I always knew it.

1799
01:30:54.722 --> 01:30:56.390
Oh, son, I knew
you could do it.

1800
01:30:56.424 --> 01:30:58.592
Oh, my heart, my heart!
Okay.

1801
01:30:58.626 --> 01:30:59.994
One goal! One goal!

1802
01:31:11.605 --> 01:31:14.608
<i>Last saved message.</i>

1803
01:31:14.642 --> 01:31:16.877
<i>Okay, seriously,</i>

1804
01:31:16.911 --> 01:31:20.014
<i>get Mom to show you</i>
<i>how to check your messages.</i>

1805
01:31:20.047 --> 01:31:22.316
<i>Although, I guess</i>
<i>if you're hearing this,</i>

1806
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:24.051
<i>you've figured it out.</i>

1807
01:31:25.386 --> 01:31:26.954
<i>Anyway, to answer</i>
<i>your question,</i>

1808
01:31:26.988 --> 01:31:29.457
<i>school is good.</i>
<i>It's great, actually.</i>

1809
01:31:29.489 --> 01:31:31.459
<i>I genuinely like</i>
<i>all my classes.</i>

1810
01:31:31.491 --> 01:31:33.594
<i>Intro to Psych is really cool,</i>
<i>and so is Anthro.</i>

1811
01:31:33.627 --> 01:31:35.963
<i>That professor is</i>
<i>just awesome.</i>

1812
01:31:35.997 --> 01:31:38.299
<i>And everyone's happy</i>
<i>to be here.</i>

1813
01:31:38.332 --> 01:31:39.900
<i>I've met so many new people.</i>

1814
01:31:39.934 --> 01:31:42.036
<i>And there's just</i>
<i>so much to talk about.</i>

1815
01:31:42.069 --> 01:31:45.673
<i>I mean, it's like</i>
<i>anything's possible, you know?</i>

1816
01:31:46.674 --> 01:31:48.509
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I guess I'm just saying</i>

1817
01:31:48.542 --> 01:31:50.611
<i>there's more to life</i>
<i>than soccer.</i>

1818
01:31:51.612 --> 01:31:53.547
<i>Okay. Love you.</i>

1819
01:32:49.103 --> 01:32:52.440
Dear Lord.
What more can I say?

1820
01:32:52.473 --> 01:32:53.641
Nothing, really.

1821
01:32:53.674 --> 01:32:56.377
I had a dream
and it came true.

1822
01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:57.678
We scored a goal.

1823
01:32:57.711 --> 01:32:59.146
And then we scored
another goal.

1824
01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:00.247
And then we won a game!

1825
01:33:01.615 --> 01:33:03.417
And then, we lost
the next game.

1826
01:33:03.451 --> 01:33:05.586
And we didn't qualify
for the World Cup.

1827
01:33:05.619 --> 01:33:07.855
But you know what, Lord?
Despite that loss,

1828
01:33:07.888 --> 01:33:09.256
I'm happy.

1829
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:12.026
So, thank you
for sending us
Mr. Rongen.

1830
01:33:12.059 --> 01:33:14.128
We've become
quite attached to him.

1831
01:33:14.161 --> 01:33:17.532
It's like finding
a little lost white kid
at the mall

1832
01:33:17.566 --> 01:33:19.300
and telling him
which way to go.

1833
01:33:20.367 --> 01:33:22.470
Thank you, Lord.
Amen.

1834
01:33:22.503 --> 01:33:23.671
Amen.

1835
01:33:23.704 --> 01:33:25.739
Dear Lord.

1836
01:33:25.773 --> 01:33:29.610
I'm praying as a weird way
of letting the team know that

1837
01:33:29.643 --> 01:33:31.412
I've been offered a job

1838
01:33:31.445 --> 01:33:33.414
with MLS side, LA Galaxy

1839
01:33:33.447 --> 01:33:35.082
starting immediately.

1840
01:33:36.383 --> 01:33:40.555
But as of today,
I've decided not to take
the job. Amen.

1841
01:33:40.589 --> 01:33:42.089
- Amen.
- Wow, Lord, that is

1842
01:33:42.123 --> 01:33:45.826
a huge gesture
and a real credit to us
as a team.

1843
01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.829
Uh, well, Lord,
the thing is

1844
01:33:49.296 --> 01:33:50.397
I'm still leaving.

1845
01:33:52.299 --> 01:33:53.868
But not for football,
Lord.

1846
01:33:54.536 --> 01:33:56.637
I want some time
for me.

1847
01:33:56.670 --> 01:33:58.540
Uh, you know,
so I can remind myself

1848
01:33:58.573 --> 01:34:00.975
that there's other
more important things

1849
01:34:01.008 --> 01:34:03.344
to life than this game.
Amen.

1850
01:34:03.377 --> 01:34:04.912
- Amen.
- Dear Lord.

1851
01:34:04.945 --> 01:34:06.914
Way to get
our hopes up, jeez!

1852
01:34:06.947 --> 01:34:09.416
It's a real
rollercoaster ride,
this one.

1853
01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:11.252
Oh, well, in that case,

1854
01:34:11.285 --> 01:34:16.891
please tell Mr. Rongen
that we love him
very much.

1855
01:34:16.924 --> 01:34:21.195
And that he will always
have a home here
in American Samoa.

1856
01:34:24.431 --> 01:34:25.432
Amen.

1857
01:35:04.104 --> 01:35:05.172
Do you want
to get your asses kicked

1858
01:35:05.206 --> 01:35:08.008
by Tonga?
Go! Pressure! Fighter!

1859
01:35:08.610 --> 01:35:10.477
Ay-ay-ay, Daru.

1860
01:35:11.646 --> 01:35:12.780
Yes, yes.

1861
01:35:23.658 --> 01:35:24.693
Good job.

1862
01:35:35.936 --> 01:35:37.738
Come on, Jaiyah, go!
Push, push, push, push!

1863
01:35:38.906 --> 01:35:40.341
Just want to say,
I love you guys.

1864
01:35:40.374 --> 01:35:44.912
No matter how different I am.
And how different we all are.

1865
01:43:16.097 --> 01:43:18.533
<i>And so ends</i>
<i>our tale of woe.</i>

1866
01:43:18.566 --> 01:43:20.568
I guess
it just goes to show,

1867
01:43:20.601 --> 01:43:22.369
no matter
what happens to you,

1868
01:43:22.402 --> 01:43:24.672
when the going gets rough,
when the chips are down,

1869
01:43:24.706 --> 01:43:26.440
when you feel like
you can't carry on,

1870
01:43:26.473 --> 01:43:28.341
when you feel
like there's no hope

1871
01:43:29.043 --> 01:43:30.611
or you just can't do it,

1872
01:43:32.379 --> 01:43:34.247
anything can happen

1873
01:43:34.281 --> 01:43:37.185
and a whole lot
of miracles

1874
01:43:37.217 --> 01:43:40.420
when you just have
a little bit of faith.

1875
01:43:47.227 --> 01:43:48.629
Ah, shit!
