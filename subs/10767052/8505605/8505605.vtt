he got older.

some anger issues.

My dad said that we needed
to put the dog down.

he is whimpering.

real improvement

1370
00:59:30.738 --> 00:59:31.906

a real job after this.

Alex,
what are you saying?

1373
00:59:38.479 --> 00:59:40.181
Look, Thomas,
I once had this dog.

1374
00:59:40.214 --> 00:59:42.116
I know about the dog.
No, this is
a different dog.

1375
00:59:42.149 --> 00:59:44.218
You don't know this dog.
This dog was, uh,

1376
00:59:44.251 --> 00:59:45.486
this dog was
never any good.

1377
00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:46.921
He was slow
and he couldn't run,

1378
00:59:46.954 --> 00:59:49.190
and he never
caught a stick
or did anything

1379
00:59:49.223 --> 00:59:53.160
and so,
the kindest thing to do
was to put him down.

1380
00:59:54.028 --> 00:59:55.729
So, we killed him.
Shot him.

1381
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:58.799
The team is the dog?

1382
00:59:58.833 --> 01:00:01.135
Yeah, of course,
the team is the dog.
It's a metaphor.

1383
01:00:01.168 --> 01:00:03.938
How many dogs
do you think
I've killed?

1384

is only as fast
as its slowest animal.

That's like

1386

we can score a goal.
