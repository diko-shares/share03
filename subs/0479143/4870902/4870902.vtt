00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.320
<i>Yet another quick knockout for
Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.</i>

2
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.440
<i>The fans let him know
how they feel about it.</i>

3
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.480
<i>Hide the women and children.
This could get ugly.</i>

4
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.600
<i>This crowd does nothing to hide
its anger over this latest debacle.</i>

5
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.720
<i>The fans are mad as hell.
They don't want to take it anymore.</i>

6
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.680
<i>They seem to be blaming Dixon,
a good fighter, for the decline...</i>

7
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.960
<i>... not only of the heavyweight-division
guys, but of the entire sport.</i>

8
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.480
<i>They're actually pelting...</i>

9
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.080
<i>... the undefeated heavyweight
champion of the world with ice.</i>

10
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.760
<i>Maybe this angry, visceral reaction
will pressure Dixon to fight someone...</i>

11
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.760
<i>... who can fight back for a change.
If there's somebody out there.</i>

12
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.920
<i>All of boxing is hoping for a warrior
who thrills us with his passion.</i>

13
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.960
Time goes by too fast.

14
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.280
Yeah? Not fast enough.

15
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.560
- Your kid should've been here.
- That's all right.

16
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.000
- No, it ain't all right.
- The kid gets a little busy sometimes.

17
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.800
He don't get that busy.

18
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.040
Let's not talk about it here, okay?
You're coming tonight, right?

19
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.800
I'm working. I took the tour
the last three years.

20
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.960
I know, but it's the anniversary.

21
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.680
Fine. You got my word.

22
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.120
I appreciate it, thank you.
I owe you, Paulie.

23
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.440
Yo, Robert. What's going on?
Where have you been? You're late.

24
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.720
No. I don't wanna hear this.
Look, your job performance...

25
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.760
...is nowhere near good enough
to be pulling this.

26
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.800
I don't give a damn who your father is.
You understand me?

27
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.120
- All right. Now get out of here.
- Okay.

28
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.960
Thank you, sir.

29
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.440
Yo, Robert. Yo.

30
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.280
- Hey, Rocky.
- Hey.

31
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.760
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

32
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.360
What's up, champ?

33
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.160
- You caught me off guard.
- I know.

34
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.160
I wanted to catch you
before you got busy.

35
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.920
Yeah, it gets busy up there.

36
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.560
- So how you doing? Yeah?
- Real good. Yeah.

37
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.840
- Yo, Rock!
- Yeah, how you doing?

38
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.560
Yeah, real good.

39
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.240
Listen, you wanna go out
and get some coffee?

40
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.000
I'm kind of behind. Maybe later?

41
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.440
Yeah. That'd be great. You ought to
come by the restaurant tonight.

42
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.960
I can have something
made special for you.

43
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.840
Tonight I can't. I got plans.
A few of the guys get together.

44
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.960
- Did I do something wrong?
- What do you mean?

45
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.680
Well, I don't know exactly
what I mean...

46
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.640
...but I just think, like, when I come
here, you don't feel so comfortable.

47
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.000
And I certainly don't wanna do that.

48
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.240
- Well, you throw a big shadow.
- A big shadow?

49
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.920
You're not gonna get anything done
down here, Robert.

50
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.320
Well, if you're not gonna introduce me,
I will. Hi, I'm William Tomilson.

51
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.560
- How you doing?
- Your son works for me.

52
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.720
- It's a good job.
- Yeah.

53
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.600
I've told Robert about 20 times
that I wanted to meet you.

54
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.840
You're pretty busy,
which isn't a bad thing.

55
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.320
- I get a little tied up.
- Grab a shot, will you?

56
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.000
I may not get this chance again.
Old warhorses have to stick together.

57
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.400
- The old horses, yeah.
- I'll tell you.

58
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.160
- Good thing it's not your left.
- This makes you popular with people.

59
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.360
- One, two, three.
- Finally, we get to meet.

60
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.160
I gotta get going. It was nice
to meet you face to face.

61
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.560
You take care of yourself.
Robert, I'll see you later.

62
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.280
I gotta get going.
I'll change my plans for tonight.

63
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.200
That'd be great.
I'm looking forward to it.

64
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.760
- How you doing?
- Okay.

65
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.640
- Okay.
- All right.

66
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.080
And do not let those numbers
drive you crazy.

67
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.120
- Too late.
- Use an eraser, get rid of all of them.

68
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.320
- Yo, Rock.
- Hey, guys.

69
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.680
- Hey, Rock.
- Hey, how you doing?

70
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.440
There you go.

71
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.200
It'll be about 10 tenths.
You guys take care, okay? You got it.

72
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.320
I'll try a few of these later on.

73
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.560
- It's good for baking.
- How much...?

74
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.600
- Yo, Paul, what's the cost?
- 58.40, sir.

75
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.080
All right, take it out of that.
I trust you.

76
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.920
- How you doing?
- You're too generous.

77
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.720
Not a problem.

78
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.520
How you guys doing?

79
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.640
How we doing, Isabel?

80
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.080
Okay, except for the freebie
reading the Bible.

81
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.600
- He's okay.
- Just because you fought him...

82
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.520
...don't mean you gotta feed him.
He doesn't look like a fighter.

83
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.280
Spider Rico could hit.

84
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.920
- Listen, how's your stomach?
- It's okay.

85
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.320
If you keep rubbing olive oil
on your stomach...

86
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.400
...your kid's gonna be
born very strong.

87
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.320
- Okay, Rocky. Whatever you say.
- No, really.

88
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.560
- Yo, how you doing, Spider?
- God bless you, Rocky.

89
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.920
Thanks.

90
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.920
How you guys doing?

91
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.360
Jose, can you make something special
for my kid who's coming tonight?

92
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.800
No problemo.

93
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.920
Good. I appreciate it.

94
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.400
<i>Back and forth, back and forth,
give and take.</i>

95
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.680
And then I went in there like an animal
and threw him into the corner...

96
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.400
...and I unloaded everything I had.
Hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.

97
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.080
But Creed, he kept
busting me back pretty good...

98
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.120
...and the agony began to pile up.

99
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.440
Then I heard the best sound
that I ever heard in my life...

100
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.160
- The bell.
- That's right, the bell.

101
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.360
I ain't never been so tired,
and I'm sitting in my corner.

102
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.040
I'm trying to figure out
how to survive the last round...

103
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.960
...when Mickey leans
into my ear and says:

104
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.120
"Come on, get out there
and fight this guy hard, you bum.

105
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.920
You gotta be first. You gotta be first."
I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could...

106
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.720
- "I would."
...I would."

107
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.120
The end.

108
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.840
<i>Yet another quick knockout for
Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.</i>

109
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.560
<i>The fans let him know
how they feel about it.</i>

110
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.240
<i>They're actually pelting...</i>

111
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.840
<i>... the undefeated heavyweight
champion of the world with ice.</i>

112
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.840
Hello, Adrian's. Yeah?

113
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.520
Tell him you can't make it?
Yeah, I'll give him the message.

114
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.800
I just kept hearing Mickey's voice
in my head over and over again.

115
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.840
I just dug down,
and before you know it...

116
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.080
...it was toe to toe and it was...
Excuse me.

117
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.280
Your son said he can't make it.
He said he'll take a rain check. Okay?

118
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.320
<i>Look at these birds.</i>

119
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.160
<i>Don't these birds look like candy?
Flying candy?</i>

120
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.160
<i>Hey, birdie,
you wanna fly me home?</i>

121
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.720
You need somebody
to walk you home?

122
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.560
<i>No?</i>

123
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.440
It's a cold night. We need a few laughs
in our life. What do you think? Maybe?

124
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.000
<i>Maybe? Maybe?</i>

125
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.560
<i>Okay. Let's get out of here, okay?</i>

126
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.280
That place ain't changed much
from last year.

127
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.120
Are we done?

128
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.520
Hey, how you doing, Mick?

129
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.160
That sign is falling apart, Paulie.

130
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.520
The whole world is falling apart.
Look at us.

131
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.960
Don't talk crazy, Paulie.

132
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.240
You know, I think if you live someplace
long enough, you are that place.

133
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.280
I ain't no talking building.

134
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.600
Come on, it's getting late, Rocko.

135
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.520
I get a headache from this train.

136
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.400
I remember when
she was standing there...

137
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.080
...all nervous and shy,
with this little smile.

138
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.760
And all I wanted her to do
was trust me.

139
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.880
She did.

140
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.240
- She did.
- You done?

141
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.840
- How long are we staying here?
- Not long.

142
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.240
Well, I'm glad they tore
this ice rink down.

143
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.600
Come on.

144
00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.400
You heard me.
I'm happy they tore it apart.

145
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.160
First time I walked your sister
across this ice, we was over there.

146
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.680
She was nervous, but I wasn't so great
on the blades either.

147
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.720
Ice is stupid. People standing on ice
are more stupid.

148
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.720
And over there,
when she was falling...

149
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.480
...and my hand grabbed her...

150
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.280
...and I got her arm through that coat,
I could feel it.

151
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.720
Electric.

152
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.560
You said the same thing
last year, Rock.

153
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.000
Did I?

154
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.280
- so you better develop your brain.

155
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.240
- You're left-handed.
- Absolutely.

156
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.600
Come on, Rock. Let's go.

157
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.560
We're done. There's no place
to sit down around here.

158
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.000
It's all right.

159
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.320
It ain't all right! It's depressing
and freaking cold!

160
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.560
What's the matter with you, Paulie?

161
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.960
You're living backwards, Rocko!

162
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.480
Change the channel from yesterday!
Yesterday wasn't so great!

163
00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.920
- It was to me.
- Not to me!

164
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.760
You treated her good.
You had the good times.

165
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.000
I treated her bad.
I don't have to think about this.

166
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.440
She always loved you, Paulie.

167
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.720
Sorry, Rocko,
I can't do this no more.

168
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.680
Can I help you?

169
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.640
No, no, I used to come down
to this place a long time ago.

170
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.320
I was just looking around.
No big deal.

171
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.320
Can I get you a drink?

172
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.400
- All right. Maybe just a short beer.
- Okay.

173
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.640
Go. Go on.

174
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.360
Yeah, go on.
Get him to buy a round.

175
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.320
Get him to buy a round. Go.

176
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.440
Get him to... He's got it.
He's spending money.

177
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.600
Listen, I don't mean to cross the line
or anything...

178
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.600
...but I read about your wife's passing
a few years back.

179
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.280
Yeah, it was woman cancer.

180
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.320
Yeah. I always heard
she was a nice person.

181
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.800
Yeah, the best.

182
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.040
- Do I know you?
- We met a long time ago.

183
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.560
We did?

184
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.160
When I was a kid,
you walked me home.

185
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.440
- I did?
- Told me to stop smoking and things.

186
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.040
Stop smoking...

187
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.080
Are you Little Marie that used to
hang out at that Atomic Hoagie shop?

188
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.000
Yeah, that's right.

189
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.880
Yeah, now I remember.
I walked you home.

190
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.760
When you got there, you turned
around and said, "Screw you, creepo."

191
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.120
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah, you did.

192
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.600
- You sure?
- Great insults last a long time.

193
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.000
Yo! Yo, is that you?
Is that really you?

194
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.720
- How you doing?
- I think he wants to drink alone.

195
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.800
Well, then give him his drink, then.
I ain't stopping you.

196
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.320
What's that, your man or something?
No, I don't think so.

197
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.200
Anyway, me and my friends,
we're right down there.

198
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.560
Think you could buy us a round?
You got the money. Just one round.

199
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.480
Hey. Thank you.

200
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.640
What are you doing
pushing my hand away like that?

201
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.080
- What's your name?
- Angie. What do you wanna know for?

202
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.120
- Don't be playing a fool for that guy.
- A fool?

203
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.400
- Yeah.
- A fool?

204
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.440
I'm the fool? You're the fool, not me!

205
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.480
You got it twisted. You're the fool.
I'm a person, just like you.

206
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.120
You ain't no better than me. You think
you're a big shot now? You're nothing.

207
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.960
You ain't no better than me.
No better!

208
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.760
Glad you dropped in?

209
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.480
I think the neighborhood
is changing a little.

210
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.920
- What was that all about?
- I don't know. Forget about it.

211
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.200
I'm gonna lock up, so if you wanna
take off, I'll tally everything up.

212
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.920
- Yeah, thanks.
- How you doing, Rock?

213
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.640
I'm good, thanks.

214
00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.760
- You live around here?
- About eight blocks from here.

215
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.640
Eight blocks.

216
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.480
You need a lift?

217
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.880
All right.

218
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.760
Did you ever get married?

219
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.640
- Yeah, sort of.
- Sort of?

220
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.200
- Yeah, well, he took off.
- Poof, just like that?

221
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.400
Yeah, just like that.

222
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.600
- You sort of have any kids?
- Yeah, I got one kid.

223
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.280
Yeah? Me too. Me too.
Wonderful boy.

224
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.960
Hey, tough guy! What's the matter,
you can't buy a round?

225
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.560
The girl was being nice
to your dumb ass.

226
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.280
- What you doing with that pig?
- Think you can disrespect us?

227
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.240
- She ain't nothing but a jealous bitch!
- Come on back!

228
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.280
Hey, don't listen to them.

229
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.360
Both of youse,
you ain't no better than me.

230
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.640
Come over here, you'll get
your head kicked in around here.

231
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.720
- You punch-drunk, goofy bastard.
- You ain't no big shot, look at you.

232
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.640
You ain't even got a car
to take that pig home.

233
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.480
You all right?

234
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.920
Yeah.

235
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.120
What are you doing?
Don't get out. It's all right.

236
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.880
No, Little Marie. It ain't all right.

237
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.160
- Yo.
- What?

238
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.240
I'll tell you what. Get inside.

239
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.320
- You get inside. Yeah, you.
- Hey, leave him alone!

240
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.680
- Yo, man!
- See it?

241
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.920
- You see that? You see that?
- Yeah. All right.

242
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.320
- What do you say?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

243
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.080
Get a job!

244
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.400
That guy sends his apologies.

245
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.640
Okay.

246
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.960
Martin. Martin. Yo, Martin!

247
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.400
I see you still got your key.

248
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.400
Yeah, I got a key.
You got time to talk?

249
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.640
I got a lot of time
since your people let me go.

250
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.000
You know I had
nothing to do with that.

251
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.640
Yeah.

252
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.200
Yeah, we moved in
about a year ago.

253
00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.600
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I mean, it's only temporary.

254
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.560
- Yeah, I could see that.
- I'm gonna look for an apartment.

255
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.240
Apartments are nice.

256
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.080
Yeah. It is what it is, you know.

257
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.040
Yeah, it is what it is.

258
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.280
This place used to be pretty nice.
There's a lot of history around here.

259
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.920
- Yeah.
- Like down the street...

260
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.600
...is the Cambria Fight Club.

261
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.560
They used to call it
the Bucket of Blood.

262
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.840
I took some massive beatings there.
But it was nice. Good memories.

263
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.880
And I heard these buildings are like,
I don't know, 100, 150 years old.

264
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.920
If I was 150 years old, I'd be falling
apart too. So it's okay, building.

265
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.240
Does that light work?

266
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.640
- No, it's burnt out or something. Yeah.
- Yeah?

267
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.360
Listen, thanks for the ride,
and I'm sorry about those guys.

268
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.960
Some of those guys just got their
brains on backwards and stuff.

269
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.880
- What's he doing out so late?
- Is that your kid?

270
00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.080
Yeah. Wish he wouldn't
stay out so late.

271
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.040
- Amazing.
- Yeah, what's that?

272
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.880
Last time I seen you,
you was a kid...

273
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.120
...and now you officially
got one of your own.

274
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.320
It's amazing.

275
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.400
You know, he sort of resembles you.
He's got that big Irish hair.

276
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.480
Yeah, it's the other one.

277
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.080
- Yeah?
- His father was from Jamaica.

278
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.520
Jamaica? European.

279
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.760
Was you on a cruise ship
or something?

280
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.760
- No, not really.
- What's his name?

281
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.360
- Steps. Short for Stevenson.
- Makes sense.

282
00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.760
Does he look mad at me, or is it
maybe the angle I'm standing at?

283
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.480
No. He's a good kid.

284
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.960
- You wanna meet him?
- It's getting kind of late.

285
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.560
- I got so many things to do.
- Yeah, yeah, I understand.

286
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.200
Thanks again for the ride
and everything else.

287
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.640
I'll see you.

288
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.120
You too.

289
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.040
Hey, Steps, come on. Let's go.
Say good night to your friend.

290
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.600
What are you doing out
in the cold with no hat on?

291
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.040
- Did you get something to eat?
- Yeah, I already ate.

292
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.720
All right.

293
00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.120
- You're late, you know.
- I can take care of myself.

294
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.800
Yo, Little Marie!

295
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.800
Ain't you gonna
introduce me to your kid?

296
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.080
- How you doing, Steps?
- What's up?

297
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.240
Listen, I got this place, this restaurant,
nice little eatery not too far from here.

298
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.320
What's all this junk? Got a tissue.

299
00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.960
Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo,
all the stuff in my pocket, you know.

300
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.200
Here you go.
I got a card, there it is.

301
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.320
And if you ever get a chance,
it'd be great...

302
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.200
...if both of youse
come down there and eat.

303
00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.960
It'd be great, free. You know.
Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.

304
00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.520
I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.

305
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.600
See you later.

306
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.360
Come on, let's go.

307
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.000
<i>You've known what's best for you
since you were 10.</i>

308
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.080
Since you walked in here alone.

309
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.400
Got everything money can buy...

310
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.520
...except what it can't.

311
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.120
It's pride. Pride is what got
your ass out of here.

312
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.360
Losing is what brung you back.

313
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.440
But people like you, they need
to be tested. Need a challenge.

314
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.760
That ain't gonna happen.
Ain't nothing out there.

315
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.360
There's always somebody
out there. Always.

316
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.960
When that time comes
and you find something...

317
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.520
...standing in front of you
that ain't running...

318
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.800
...that ain't backing up, hitting on you,
and you're too damn tired to breathe...

319
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.000
You find that situation on you,
that's good.

320
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.600
Because that's baptism under fire.

321
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.160
You get through that,
you find the only kind of respect...

322
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.920
...that matters in this damn world:

323
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.160
Self-respect.

324
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.360
Thanks, Martin. I appreciate that.

325
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.200
Now, what can the champ
do for you?

326
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.040
You can give me
some of that money you got.

327
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.720
- You know, I like you, Martin.
- But not that much.

328
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.680
Exactly.

329
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.440
How about a picture with the kid?
All right?

330
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.960
Sure.

331
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.480
Here, son, hold up your fist.
Makes you look more hazardous.

332
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.280
- There you go.
- Thanks, Rock.

333
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.200
Enjoy your meal.

334
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.560
- He's a nice guy, isn't he?
- Rocky?

335
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.760
- Yeah.
- Spider just went downstairs.

336
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.280
- I don't know if that's all right.
- What's he doing?

337
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.640
I don't know. That's your friend.

338
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.840
Yo, Spider!

339
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.440
- Let me do some dishes. I feel better.
- Come on. You're my guest.

340
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.000
- Let me do something.
- Keep eating. Guests do that.

341
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.480
Don't make me fight you again.
Last time you got lucky.

342
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.880
Lucky? Okay.

343
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.640
Jesus wants me to work.

344
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.680
- Yo, Rocky.
- Yeah?

345
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.880
You've got guests.

346
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.080
Don't get too wet, okay?

347
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.160
Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.

348
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.880
You kept the card.

349
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.800
Yeah, I kept the card.

350
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.200
- Why don't you sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

351
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.760
Because, you know what, I walk in
there, I say good morning, I do this:

352
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.560
<i>Tonight, boxing once again.</i>

353
00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.400
<i>Two contrasting styles
in almost every way.</i>

354
00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.760
Hey, can you turn this up?
Turn this up, please.

355
00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.120
<i>Who was the best of all time?
If two athletes from different eras...</i>

356
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.360
<i>... could compete against one another,
who would come out on top?</i>

357
00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.160
<i>Given the same rules, using the same
equipment, who was the greatest?</i>

358
00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.080
<i>We feed our facts
into the computer.</i>

359
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.560
<i>They weigh in on who they
think will reign supreme...</i>

360
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.720
<i>... while fielding the comments of our
illustrious panel of sportswriters.</i>

361
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.840
Champ!

362
00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.760
- Yo, champ!
- Yeah?

363
00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.720
Come check out this trash
they're talking about you, man!

364
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.720
- What you talking about?
- Come check this out. Hurry up.

365
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.240
<i>Tonight, the former two-time
heavyweight champion...</i>

366
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.360
<i>... from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.</i>

367
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.440
<i>All right, Chuck Johnson,
USA Today?</i>

368
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.240
<i>There's no question that
Rocky Balboa fought tougher fights...</i>

369
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.880
<i>... during a tougher era in boxing.</i>

370
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.800
<i>You look at Mason Dixon
in his career...</i>

371
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.200
<i>... he's basically been
spoon-fed his opponents.</i>

372
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.440
<i>No question in my mind.
Not only does Rocky win...</i>

373
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.880
<i>... but he wins knockout.</i>

374
00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.440
Rocky!

375
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.720
Offspring.

376
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960
<i>Bernard Fernandez?</i>

377
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.800
<i>Dixon is a victim
of his own dominance.</i>

378
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.920
<i>He's never been in
real knockdown-dragout brawls.</i>

379
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.760
<i>He never had to dig down
to rally back.</i>

380
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.040
<i>If he tries to dig down
against Balboa...</i>

381
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.560
<i>... he'll find he doesn't have
a big enough shovel.</i>

382
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.440
<i>I clearly give it to Balboa.</i>

383
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.720
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

384
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.200
<i>Boxing historian
Burt Randolph Sugar.</i>

385
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.400
<i>Dixon has fought cream puffs.
We don't know what he's made of.</i>

386
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.640
<i>But both in their primes,
you gotta factor in...</i>

387
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.600
<i>... Dixon's unbelievable speed...</i>

388
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.280
<i>... his slashing offense.
He cuts Balboa to bits.</i>

389
00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.160
<i>No doubt. Dixon wins all the way.</i>

390
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.680
<i>Here's where our subjectivity ends.
Let's see what the computer says.</i>

391
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.400
<i>Dixon unloads on Balboa. Rocky has
no answer. Balboa is eating jabs.</i>

392
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.120
- What time is it?
- Mason time.

393
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.840
- What time is it?
- Mason time.

394
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.080
- What time is it?
- Mason time.

395
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.360
<i>Now Dixon is done. He is reeling.
He is almost out on his feet!</i>

396
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.960
<i>Balboa turning up the heat.
Pounds him across the ring.</i>

397
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.720
<i>Boy, he's bit off more than he
can chew this time. Believe it.</i>

398
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.080
<i>Oh, a murderous right hook!
And Dixon is out on his feet.</i>

399
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.520
<i>He is out cold as he
crumbles to the canvas.</i>

400
00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.720
<i>And it is Balboa who has won...</i>

401
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.480
Ladies and gentlemen, Baby Rocky.
Baby Rocky.

402
00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.960
I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat
that up, it's pretty good in the morning.

403
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.600
Yeah, thanks, man.

404
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.640
Nice kid. I hope this music ain't giving
you a headache. I like this old stuff.

405
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.880
No, I like it. It's nice.

406
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.280
Well, good. Good.

407
00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.360
Yo, you think Steps wants a job?
Make a few bucks on the weekend?

408
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.000
It's good making your own G's. My kid
stashed a few bucks doing that.

409
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.200
Why are you being so nice?

410
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.520
I don't want you to think
nothing's off, you know.

411
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.720
My wife, she's gone, but she ain't.
You know what I mean?

412
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.880
Yeah, well, I wasn't thinking that.
Believe me.

413
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.560
- No? Then what was you thinking?
- No.

414
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.080
That you don't owe us nothing.
What are you doing?

415
00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.880
Be patient.

416
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.480
Now...

417
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.800
...I don't owe you nothing,
but why do you gotta...

418
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.440
...owe something to get...?

419
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.520
Bingo.

420
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.800
Why do you gotta owe something
to get something, you know? Really.

421
00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.120
I think hanging out with your kid
would be nice. What do you think?

422
00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.400
I think that'd be nice.

423
00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.720
Good. That's very nice.

424
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.000
I'm glad you come by.

425
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.600
It was nice watching you eat.

426
00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.160
Good company.

427
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.520
Yo, Little Marie. Let there be light!

428
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.080
- You like dogs?
- Dogs?

429
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.760
Dogs. This is like a dog pound.
It's where they keep...

430
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.720
...a large variety of dogs. I used to
come here all the time for sightseeing.

431
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.160
But, you know,
you learn a lot talking to dogs.

432
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.640
- Really, you do.
- Yeah, man. So...

433
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.200
Hey, man, how about this one?

434
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.440
He don't look too friendly, my friend.

435
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.200
Man, this is the one.
Hey, boy, how you doing?

436
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.480
Hey, what about this one here?
Come here, boy.

437
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.080
- Who, him?
- Yeah, why not?

438
00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.320
Hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.

439
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.640
I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.
If you look at it closely, the color...

440
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.480
...it looks like old furniture, like some
kind of pirate-chest thing going on.

441
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.000
Yeah, sure, man.
Hey, so how about a young one?

442
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.480
Steps, forget him. Come over here.
I want you to see something.

443
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.840
Now, you notice what this animal
is doing here? Lying in that position?

444
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.200
He ain't doing nothing.

445
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.000
No, he's doing a lot.
He ain't wasting no energy.

446
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.280
Because he's dead.

447
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.080
He ain't dead. There's a lot of
good mileage left on that animal.

448
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.120
Good food, the addition of a couple
of new friends, bingo, he's back.

449
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.600
- What do you think is a good name?
- It's your dog. You name him.

450
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.240
No. It's, like,
a community animal. Fifty-fifty.

451
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.760
Look, I don't know much
about no dogs.

452
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.480
Well, it ain't that complicated.

453
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.120
You pet him, you feed him,
and nature takes its course.

454
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.040
You know, so...
Don't you wanna name an animal?

455
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.040
Every guy should at one time
try to name an animal something.

456
00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.920
I don't know. Fleabag?

457
00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.600
It's catchy. It ain't original,
but it's pretty good.

458
00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.040
I think you could come up with,
in your young brain...

459
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.080
...something better to throw out
than Fleabag.

460
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.640
Punchy. How's that?

461
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.400
- Punchy?
- Yeah, Punchy.

462
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.960
- I like it, you know.
- For real?

463
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:25.160
Yeah, for real. Punchy it is. It's easy to
remember, it's not that hard to spell.

464
00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.560
And once it's in your brain, you never
forget it. Punchy. Very good.

465
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.280
- All right, man.
- Good call.

466
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.480
All right, Punchy. You ready
to get bailed out, my friend?

467
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.520
Okay.

468
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.400
Hey, you know
it was a joke, don't you?

469
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.200
Yeah, I know.
You're a very funny guy.

470
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.160
Rocky?

471
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.120
<i>The fans let him know
how they feel about it.</i>

472
00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.440
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

473
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.280
<i>This could get ugly.</i>

474
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.440
- Rock.
- Yo, Paulie.

475
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.400
They're gonna be talking about
that fake Looney Tune fight.

476
00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.720
Hey, come on. We're about
to serve today's special.

477
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.200
Italian food cooked up by a bunch
of Mexicans ain't so special.

478
00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.240
Hey, yo.

479
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.040
Hey, I skipped work for this.

480
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.280
What an ugly dog.

481
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.760
It's a cute dog.

482
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.120
- Hey, Rock.
- Yeah?

483
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.080
I'm gonna take off.
That stuff back there is pretty cool.

484
00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.560
- Oh, you like that?
- Yeah, man.

485
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.240
- Thanks, I appreciate it.
- I'll catch you later.

486
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.120
All right.

487
00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.640
- Who's the criminal?
- He's a nice kid.

488
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.400
He dresses like a bum.

489
00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.280
Coming from a human hamper,
that's quite a compliment.

490
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.120
Hide the silverware.

491
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.800
That's nice.

492
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.760
Hey, Spider.

493
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.520
Didn't you knock out
that bum once?

494
00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.600
Will you give it a rest?

495
00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.720
I'm gonna be late for work for this.
Give me a break, huh?

496
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.600
All right. Just for a few seconds.

497
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.840
<i>In the late '60s, a simulated fight
took place between two legends...</i>

498
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.320
<i>... Muhammad Ali
and Rocky Marciano.</i>

499
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.120
<i>Marciano long retired,
and Ali unable to fight legitimately...</i>

500
00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.520
<i>... for three years for having refused
induction into the armed forces...</i>

501
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.360
<i>... was in need of money,
and agreed to the dream match...</i>

502
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.960
<i>... whose outcome would be
decided by a computer.</i>

503
00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.280
<i>It's almost 35 years
since Rocky Marciano...</i>

504
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.720
<i>... won the much-disputed
computer decision...</i>

505
00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.480
<i>... and guess what?
Not much has changed.</i>

506
00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.720
<i>Last week, Rocky Balboa
won a decisive fight...</i>

507
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.800
See? That's the cartoon fight
I'm telling you about.

508
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.400
Yeah.

509
00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.960
<i>A stunning knockout.</i>

510
00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.640
<i>Keep in mind, this is taking
the human factor out of it.</i>

511
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.560
<i>- The computer says Balboa...
- Beautiful.</i>

512
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:31.320
<i>... would be triumphant, KO 13.
And here's some of the fallout:</i>

513
00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.600
<i>What started as a simple
form of entertainment...</i>

514
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.960
<i>... has become a rallying cry
for people who think...</i>

515
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.760
<i>... an old-school athlete like Balboa
could actually be better.</i>

516
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.520
<i>Computer technology has to create
what isn't. That's just not responsible.</i>

517
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.560
Get therapy, will you?

518
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.160
<i>How do you think Balboa
would have done against Dixon?</i>

519
00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.360
<i>Badly. Personally, I think Balboa
was completely overrated.</i>

520
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.280
<i>He owns a restaurant
in South Philly.</i>

521
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.320
<i>What's the specialty,
pounded chicken?</i>

522
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.800
<i>Anyway, I would have paid to see
the fight. Next topic, NAS CAR...</i>

523
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.800
<i>... and the controversy
that won't go away.</i>

524
00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.280
<i>Let's go back to Sunday's race...</i>

525
00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.040
Hey, hey, hey, cheer up.

526
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.560
It's free advertisement.
Come on. Meat house calls.

527
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.920
Yo, Robert.

528
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.880
What are you doing out so late?

529
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.480
I tried calling,
but nothing was picking up.

530
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.800
- Is something wrong?
- I just wanted to come by...

531
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.880
...and see you in person.
- Wanna come inside?

532
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.720
No. I just wanna get
your opinion on something.

533
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.760
Sure. Opinion on what?

534
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.160
You know, they say you only
go around once, right?

535
00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.480
- Yeah, I've heard that.
- Well...

536
00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.040
...I think I wanna, like,
do something.

537
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.000
- Like what?
- Fight.

538
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.200
You know, nothing big.
Small stuff, like locally. You know.

539
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.760
Don't you think you're too,
you know, old?

540
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.120
You think you ought to
stop trying things...

541
00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.640
...because you had a few
too many birthdays? I do not.

542
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.200
People will think you're crazy.

543
00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.080
What's crazy about standing
toe to toe saying, "I am," you know?

544
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.800
That's just ego talking.

545
00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.840
What are you trying to prove
to other people, Pop?

546
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.200
Prove? Listen, I stopped thinking...

547
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.400
...the way other people think
a long time ago.

548
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.160
You gotta think like you think.

549
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.520
- I do.
- Do you? Good.

550
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:27.040
You gotta face reality, okay?
It's a different world now.

551
00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.160
Only the clothes is different.

552
00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.960
I really don't know
what you want from me.

553
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.080
I just wanted us to get involved.
You know, like, home team.

554
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:47.280
Look, whatever it is, whatever
you're going through, it'll pass.

555
00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.400
Yeah, you're probably right.

556
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.000
Time is gonna catch up to all of us.

557
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.400
- Especially if you're standing still.
- Hey, come on.

558
00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.360
Look, I'm gonna call you
in the morning.

559
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.520
<i>- Did you tell this to your kid?
- Yeah, I did.</i>

560
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.760
<i>- What'd he think, you're nuts, right?
- Yeah.</i>

561
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:13.440
Oh, well, he don't believe in you?
Welcome to my world, buddy.

562
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.680
Rocko, nobody's giving you
no title shot.

563
00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.160
I know that. I don't want one.

564
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.640
So this isn't a mental disturbance?

565
00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.040
No.

566
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.120
You're mad because
they took down your statue?

567
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.480
No.

568
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.760
Not really, no.

569
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.840
If it's about money, just hang a sign
around your neck saying, "Punch me."

570
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.880
Five dollars, you'll make big money.

571
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.840
What? You haven't peaked yet?

572
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.000
- Peaked?
- Yeah, peaked.

573
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.800
I don't know. There's still
some stuff in the basement.

574
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.480
- What basement?
- In here.

575
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.880
Tell me about the stuff.

576
00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.400
- What about it?
- Tell me about the stuff inside.

577
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.920
- Is it angry?
- Angry?

578
00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.080
Are you mad because
Adrian left you?

579
00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.720
She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.

580
00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.640
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

581
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.520
You know, sometimes
it's hard to breathe.

582
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.280
You know, I feel, like,
this beast inside me.

583
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.120
It's okay, Rocko. Please, it's okay.

584
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.560
Is it okay?

585
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.120
I just never knew it was
supposed to be this hard.

586
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.120
It wasn't supposed to be like this,
Paulie. You know, it...

587
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.760
So you wanna come by
and help me train?

588
00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.320
I got a job here.

589
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.240
I understand.

590
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.400
Remember you said if you stay
one place long enough...

591
00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.840
...you become that place?

592
00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.640
Rocko, this is all I got.

593
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.480
I understand, Paulie. I do.

594
00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.720
If you get time and come down
and see me train, I'd appreciate it.

595
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.560
Of course, Rocko.

596
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.200
Bye, Paulie.

597
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:20.880
Goodbye, Rocko.

598
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.440
Goodbye, Rocko.

599
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.920
Take care, Rocko.

600
00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.520
<i>This plenary session of the
Pennsylvania Athletic Commission...</i>

601
00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:41.000
...is convened in order to consider
the application of Rocky Balboa...

602
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:45.240
...for the issuance of a discretionary
professional boxing license...

603
00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:50.000
...due to his ineligibility to be
licensed as a matter of right.

604
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.960
Mr. Balboa, you're welcome here.
Since you're representing yourself...

605
00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.160
...we invite you to make an opening
statement, if you'd like to.

606
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.760
No, I was just curious how I did,
that's all.

607
00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.280
All right, well, the Medical
Advisory Board has informed us...

608
00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.240
...that the battery of tests
to which you've been subjected...

609
00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.560
...you've passed these tests
with flying colors.

610
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.200
And we congratulate you for that.

611
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.160
- Thanks.
- However, this commission...

612
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.920
...in good conscience,
cannot recommend you for a license...

613
00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.400
...and we therefore deny
your application.

614
00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.360
- Didn't I do what you asked?
- Yes, you did.

615
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.160
So I should get a license, right?

616
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.600
Not exactly.

617
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.880
So why did you give me all them tests
if you was never passing me?

618
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.960
We've gotta stand by
our decision here...

619
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.320
...and we have to deny your request
for a license at this time.

620
00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.600
Yo, don't I got some rights?

621
00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.760
What rights do you think
you're referring to?

622
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.480
Like in that official paper
they wrote down the street?

623
00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.520
- That's the Bill of Rights.
- Bill of Rights.

624
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.800
Don't it say something about going
after what makes you happy?

625
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.640
No, that's "the pursuit of happiness."
But what's your point?

626
00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.920
My point is I'm pursuing something,
and nobody looks too happy about it.

627
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.480
But we're just looking out
for your interests.

628
00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.160
I appreciate that, but maybe you're
looking out for your interests more.

629
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.520
You shouldn't ask people to come here
and pay the freight on something.

630
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.720
They pay, it still ain't good enough.
You think that's right?

631
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.040
Maybe you're doing your job, but why
you gotta stop me from doing mine?

632
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.240
If you're willing to go through all the
battling to get where you want to get...

633
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.080
...who's got the right to stop you?

634
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.520
Maybe you got something you never
finished, something you wanna do.

635
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.840
Something you never said
to somebody, something!

636
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.040
And you're told no,
even after you pay your dues.

637
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.680
Who's got the right
to tell you that? Who? Nobody!

638
00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.880
It's your right to listen to your gut.
It's nobody's right to say no...

639
00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.320
...after you earn the right to be what you
wanna be or do what you wanna do!

640
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.320
The older I get, the more things
I gotta leave behind. That's life.

641
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:03.880
The only thing I'm asking you guys
to leave on the table is what's right.

642
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.280
Yo! Have you seen
the paper today?

643
00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.520
Front row. Front row.

644
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800
That is so great.

645
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.400
- All right, all right.
- Let's go get some food. Food.

646
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.240
- Let's get a beer. Come on.
- Come on.

647
00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.680
The last two pay-per-views
were in the toilet.

648
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.320
You're not making
heavyweight-championship money.

649
00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.400
There's a bunch of nobodies
out there, Mase.

650
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.440
I wanna talk to you about an
opportunity we should run with.

651
00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.280
Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa
applied for a license and got one?

652
00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.280
- I heard. Forget about him.
- Hear me out.

653
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.680
You want me to fight a guy I can beat
with both hands tied behind my back.

654
00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.040
Everybody knows you could beat him
sitting down. That's not what it's about.

655
00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:59.360
It's about making money. We gotta
capitalize on that computer fight.

656
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.120
This could do a million buys.
That's 15, 20 million to you.

657
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.200
- Forget it.
- No one's beating the door down...

658
00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.920
...to watch you fight anymore.
- We got guaranteed fights.

659
00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.960
You wanna do this now in front
of your friends, we'll do it now.

660
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:13.440
We got nothing. All the pay-per-view
fights you come up with got rejected.

661
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.960
You know why? They're all bums
out there. Nobody cares about them.

662
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.960
There's no marquee value.
But this Balboa thing is interesting.

663
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.720
- I don't wanna do it.
- Listen to me.

664
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.640
It's a has-been, never-gonna-be world.
Call it nostalgia, whatever you want...

665
00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.880
...but people relate to that stuff.
This is a no-lose. It's all good.

666
00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.840
- Good for who?
- For you! Not for me! For you!

667
00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.960
Maybe you don't understand.
People don't like you no more.

668
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.440
They don't follow you. They're not
supporting you anymore. Understand?

669
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.640
Don't look at me like
I'm messing with your legacy.

670
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.480
Every jock now thinks
they got a legacy.

671
00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.440
A legacy is what you get instead
of getting paid. That's a legacy.

672
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.080
- Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
- I'm not no more.

673
00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:52.640
Everybody knows you could kick
this old man's ass. But you don't.

674
00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.760
Leave him with a little
dignity, so they say:

675
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.280
"Mason Dixon's got compassion.
He's a decent guy, he's a nice guy."

676
00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.760
You get a whole new audience,
we'll double your money.

677
00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.880
You want a new image?
That's how you get it.

678
00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.720
To replace the one
that you two made?

679
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.600
Whoa, wait. We made your
world green. You made the rest.

680
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.680
This is you.
You made all this junk happen.

681
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.440
I've had it up to here with this mess.

682
00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.000
Time for me to make changes.
I'm going to Martin's gym.

683
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.840
- We'll talk about it.
- Forget this crap.

684
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.280
I want Martin back.
There's nothing to talk about.

685
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.240
- How you doing?
- Hey, what a surprise.

686
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.680
I was driving around
the neighborhood, I thought...

687
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.400
...why not drive by and say hello?
- You wanna come inside?

688
00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.440
No, the dog needs some exercise.
You wanna take a little walk?

689
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.920
- Yeah, yeah. All right.
- It's nice outside.

690
00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.520
- All right.
- Nice and brisk.

691
00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:44.840
When did you get a dog?

692
00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.040
We picked up Punchy
a couple of days back.

693
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.360
- Punchy?
- Yeah.

694
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.680
You named your dog Punchy?

695
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.480
Your kid come up with the name.

696
00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.960
Oh, yeah?
I think that's disrespectful.

697
00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.840
Oh, no, no. It's fine, really.

698
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.160
No, it's easy to remember
and it's all that, you know.

699
00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.200
Listen, what do you think about
coming over to the restaurant?

700
00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.280
- What for?
- Well, you know, for, like...

701
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.720
For work. The hostess is gonna
be having a kid. You'd do good.

702
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.320
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you, you'd do so good.

703
00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.840
I appreciate what you're doing
for my kid, but I can't.

704
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.360
Hey, listen, I think you'd like it a lot.

705
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.880
It's a nice environment,
it's very pleasant.

706
00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.000
Yeah, can we drop it?

707
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.800
What's bothering you?

708
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.120
Nothing. It's all right.
Listen, I gotta get back.

709
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.360
- No, it ain't all right.
- Oh, come on.

710
00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.480
- What?
- I'm gonna be the first person...

711
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.960
...people see when they walk in?
- You give out menus.

712
00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.800
You say, "Hello, how are you?"
You sit people down.

713
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.120
Look, if I can do it,
anybody can do it.

714
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.400
You could find 10 better people,
a hundred better people for this job.

715
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.320
Give it a try, like two weeks.

716
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.240
I don't wanna try.

717
00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.520
- Who put this stuff in your head?
- Nobody.

718
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.600
Well, it just don't
get in there by itself.

719
00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.880
Thanks for coming by.

720
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:03.040
Yo, when was the last time you
went dancing? Has it been a while?

721
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.000
- Why are you asking?
- I'm asking because...

722
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.280
...you dance around these problems,
you might as well dance with me.

723
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.360
I ain't that good,
but I'm better than the average bear.

724
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.080
Where that came from, I don't know.

725
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.080
- You're crazy.
- A little bit.

726
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.400
But the way you're thinking
and talking, it's a little crazy too.

727
00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.720
Come on, you deserve better.
Really. Come on over.

728
00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.920
I need you to class my place up.
Philly needs you.

729
00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.800
And if you say, "Screw you, creepo"
again, I totally understand.

730
00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.280
But I'm warning you,
I'm gonna put myself...

731
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.240
...in the middle of the street here...

732
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.240
...and stand here, me and Punchy,
and wave to the first bus, say:

733
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.040
"Come on over here and mash me!

734
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.560
Little Marie turned down
the job at the restaurant.

735
00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.360
She thinks she's better than us."

736
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.680
Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been
a bus down here in 20 years.

737
00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.200
- Yeah?
- No.

738
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.760
That was a close call.

739
00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:00.560
Listen, seriously. Come on over.
It'd be nice.

740
00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.480
All right.

741
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.480
Paulie!

742
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.400
Sorry, Paulie.

743
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.400
Sorry.

744
00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.360
How are you?
Get my unusual up there.

745
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.200
Excuse me.
Deliveries are in the back.

746
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.000
I'm not a delivery guy.

747
00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.880
Well, do you have a reservation?

748
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.640
Do I look like a freaking Indian?

749
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.720
Hey, Rock? Rocky?

750
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.080
I think we've got a little bit
of a problem with this guy.

751
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.480
Problem?
No, no, he's just a relative.

752
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.800
Oh, okay.

753
00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.600
Yo, Paulie.

754
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.720
- What happened to your eye?
- I hit it.

755
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.720
- Why?
- Needed to.

756
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.600
What happened?

757
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.400
- I'm celebrating, Rock.
- Why?

758
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.880
- I retired.
- Retired?

759
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.000
So when did they start
giving retired people meat...

760
00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.240
...instead of watches, Paulie?

761
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.800
I don't need a watch.

762
00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:07.840
I got a watch! You gave me a watch!

763
00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.240
Paulie...

764
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.840
I don't need no goddamn watch.

765
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.400
- Yo, Paulie.
- I got a watch!

766
00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.560
I got two watches!

767
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.120
Yo, Paulie!

768
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:34.920
Yo, Paulie.

769
00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.920
Rock.

770
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:42.440
It takes guts climbing back in that ring,
knowing you're gonna take a beating.

771
00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.880
You're gonna do all right, Rocko.

772
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.400
How do you know that?

773
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.680
The stuff in the basement.

774
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.880
Thanks, Paulie.

775
00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.280
- Hey.
- Hey, Rock, how are you?

776
00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.640
- You okay?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

777
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.360
- Yeah, fine. This is great.
- Good.

778
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.080
Listen, some guys over there
wanna talk to you.

779
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.920
- Okay. You got it.
- Okay?

780
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.840
- Thanks for coming by. I appreciate it.
- Our pleasure.

781
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.880
- Wanna hear stories?
- What kind of stories?

782
00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.680
Well, a lot of people like to hear
these old fight stories.

783
00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.240
- Maybe later.
- Okay.

784
00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:39.680
I'm Lou DiBella. This is L.C. Luco.
He's Mason Dixon's manager.

785
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.200
- Will you sit down and join us?
- Sure.

786
00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.400
You know, we have the promotional
contract for Mason Dixon...

787
00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.000
...who's a big fan.
- Really?

788
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.240
When he heard you were
interested in fighting...

789
00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.520
...he thought why not try
to work something out?

790
00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.600
Like a special event.
Like a first-class exhibition fight.

791
00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.080
- Why me?
- He respects the hell out of you.

792
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.040
All right? And let's be honest,
that computer fight got people curious.

793
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.560
- This could be very interesting.
- I ain't interested...

794
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.760
...in getting, like,
mangled and embarrassed.

795
00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.000
No, that's not gonna happen.
Never happen.

796
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:14.160
Truthfully, I was thinking
more on a, like...

797
00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:18.000
...miniscule, small level.
You know. Small fights, not big fights.

798
00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:22.040
Small fights. Things that...
Local. You know what I mean?

799
00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.600
Not a bad idea. Don't think of it as big.
Think of it like an exhibition.

800
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:29.160
Think of it as a glorified sparring
session. Here's something you'll like.

801
00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.760
We're gonna donate a portion
of the gate to charity.

802
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.920
- That's always nice.
- It's good to give.

803
00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.520
Yeah.

804
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.440
Where's it taking place?

805
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.920
- Las Vegas.
- Las Vegas.

806
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.200
Nice and warm.
This cold's gotta be killing you.

807
00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.680
- Little stiff.
- You move better when you're warmer.

808
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.800
- Yeah.
- And if nothing else...

809
00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.960
...you'll have new stories to tell.

810
00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.960
- I really gotta think about this.
- Absolutely.

811
00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.440
- Is that okay?
- I understand. No problem.

812
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.880
I'm gonna go over there.
You can order something.

813
00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.040
- What do you recommend?
- It's all edible.

814
00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.360
Okay. Thanks.

815
00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.600
We got him. Imagine if Dixon
met this bastard in his prime?

816
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.120
- He'd kill him. Kill him.
- You ain't kidding.

817
00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.920
Man, I'm confused.

818
00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.640
I didn't think this was gonna
come along.

819
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.360
But this is what you wanted, right?

820
00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.760
I don't know.
You know, I talk and I talk.

821
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.920
Sometimes I think
what I'm saying is true...

822
00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:33.240
...and then I look at myself and I'm
not even sure what is true anymore.

823
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.280
Because it's like, I pushed
this crazy idea about fighting.

824
00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.920
I mean, what's it all about?

825
00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:40.920
Do I really care about standing
toe to toe and all that stuff...

826
00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.520
...or, like my kid says,
is it just, like, ego?

827
00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.320
Or am I this old pug who's just trying
to replace old pain with new pain?

828
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.960
I don't know. I don't know.

829
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.320
Look, I know
I usually don't say a lot.

830
00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:59.360
I'm always listening and looking.

831
00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:04.280
But who you are, the part of you
that's so full of life...

832
00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.400
...we all have that feeling, that fire...

833
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:10.880
...but usually never get a chance
to use it. And then it just goes away.

834
00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:15.800
But you can. You've got this
opportunity, so do it. Why not?

835
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:20.080
I mean, this is who you are.
This is who you'll always be.

836
00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.400
And you don't move aside for nobody
until you're ready to move.

837
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.280
And it doesn't matter
how this looks to other people.

838
00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.640
All that matters
is how it looks to you.

839
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.160
Rocky.

840
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.240
Rocky, look at me.

841
00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:39.600
How it looks to you.

842
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.480
And if this is something
that you wanna do...

843
00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:46.520
...and if this is something that
you gotta do, then you do it.

844
00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:49.480
Fighters fight.

845
00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.400
You're not gonna punch me,
are you?

846
00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.320
Listen, I gotta go before I wear out
my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.

847
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.000
Thanks.

848
00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.600
Fighters fight, right?

849
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:27.360
It's rare when you get to promote
an event bigger than boxing. This is.

850
00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:31.160
Skill versus will, with part
of the proceeds going to charity.

851
00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:35.360
The brainchild of Mason Dixon,
to honor past heavyweight champions.

852
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.600
Warriors like Rocky Balboa.
Let's open it up for questions.

853
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.920
Hey, champ!

854
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:43.920
A few great fighters have fought in
their 50s, often with disastrous results.

855
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.680
Why risk the danger
and embarrassment?

856
00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.200
The smart money says
you have virtually no chance.

857
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:52.240
A puncher always has a chance.
This fight will be competitive.

858
00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.520
Why are you doing this, Rocky?

859
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.720
<i>I don't know, I'd rather do
something I love badly than...</i>

860
00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:04.280
<i>Than to feel bad by not
doing something you love.</i>

861
00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.560
Rocky, the press has labeled you
a Balboasaurus.

862
00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.960
How do you feel about that?

863
00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:14.920
Let's say the following happens:
You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.

864
00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.440
You lose, say a thumb in the eye,
you'll be the joke of the decade.

865
00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.880
You all know that will never happen.
This is only an exhibition.

866
00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.320
Don't go trying to make more out
of this than that computer tried.

867
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.560
Isn't this sport in enough trouble
without these circus events?

868
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.080
- Next question.
- On the surface, this looks like...

869
00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.560
...a cheap bit of ring theater
between, no offense...

870
00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.120
...a has-been and a man
whose own credible legacy...

871
00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.720
...and popularity is in doubt.

872
00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.480
- What's the upside?
- Doubt?

873
00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.040
Upside? I mean...

874
00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:47.720
What do you mean, upside?
I mean, what do I have to do?

875
00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.080
You know, I'm 33-0
with 30 knockouts.

876
00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.160
I'm doing you people a favor.
I'm having this exhibition for you.

877
00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.200
You gonna get up here and make
a mockery out of me? I'm the champ.

878
00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.920
I mean, I get pissed,
this guy get hurt.

879
00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.440
See you at the fight.

880
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.520
The guy's a joke.
He's gonna get crushed.

881
00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.560
- Look who's here.
- How you doing?

882
00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.880
- Have you seen my father?
- He's in the back.

883
00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.760
This place has never served
this many meals. It's unbelievable.

884
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:28.840
You're doing good? Hope you're
enjoying everything, all right?

885
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.480
Excuse me.

886
00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:37.480
How you doing? Glad you come by.

887
00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.120
Can I talk with you?

888
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.800
- Sure.
- Can we do it outside?

889
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:49.160
- So you're going through with this?
- I start training tomorrow.

890
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.440
Hey, Rock.
I made some connections.

891
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.880
I can make some money
on this, endorsements.

892
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.160
Absolutely. Do that.

893
00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.880
- Thank you, Rock. Okay.
- Sure.

894
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.800
- So you nervous about the fight?
- Scared to death.

895
00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.600
- You don't look scared.
- Well, I ain't supposed to.

896
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.040
Then you don't have to do it.

897
00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.400
Yeah, well, I think I do.

898
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.440
You know, living with you,
it hasn't been easy.

899
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.120
People see me
but they think of you.

900
00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:23.000
Now with all this going on,
it's gonna be worse than ever.

901
00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.000
- It don't have to be.
- Sure it does!

902
00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.800
- Why? You've got a lot going on, kid.
- What, my last name?

903
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.800
That's the reason I got a decent job.

904
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.080
That's why people deal with me
in the first place.

905
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.840
Now I start to get a little ahead...

906
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.800
...I start to get a little something
for myself, and this happens.

907
00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.080
Now, I'm asking you as a favor
not to go through with this.

908
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:44.280
This is gonna end up bad for you,
and it's gonna end up bad for me.

909
00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:47.080
- You think I'm hurting you?
- Yeah. In a way, you are.

910
00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.160
That's the last thing
I ever wanted to do.

911
00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:52.640
I know that's not what you wanna do,
but that's just the way that it is.

912
00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.760
Don't you care what people think?
Doesn't it bother you that people...

913
00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.880
...are making you out to be a joke
and that I'll be included in that?

914
00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.920
Do you think that's right? Do you?

915
01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:12.440
You ain't gonna believe this,
but you used to fit right here.

916
01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.760
I'd hold you up
and say to your mother:

917
01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.360
"This kid is gonna be
the best kid in the world.

918
01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.640
This kid is gonna be somebody
better than anybody ever knew."

919
01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.520
And you grew up
good and wonderful.

920
01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.680
It was great just watching,
every day was like a privilege.

921
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.920
Then the time come for you to be
your own man and take on the world...

922
01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.400
...and you did. But somewhere
along the line, you changed.

923
01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.800
You stopped being you.

924
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.120
You let people stick a finger in
your face and tell you you're no good.

925
01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.800
And when things got hard, you started
looking for something to blame...

926
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.960
...like a big shadow.

927
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.560
Let me tell you something
you already know.

928
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.960
The world ain't all
sunshine and rainbows.

929
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.800
It's a very mean and nasty place,
and I don't care how tough you are...

930
01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.400
...it will beat you to your knees
and keep you there if you let it.

931
01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.880
You, me or nobody
is gonna hit as hard as life.

932
01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.000
But it ain't about how hard you hit.
It's about how hard you can get hit...

933
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.520
...and keep moving forward.

934
01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.720
How much you can take
and keep moving forward.

935
01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.200
That's how winning is done!

936
01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.280
If you know what you're worth,
go and get what you're worth.

937
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.560
But you gotta be willing to take
the hits, and not pointing fingers...

938
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.680
...saying you ain't where you wanna be
because of him or her or anybody!

939
01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.880
Cowards do that, and that ain't you!
You're better than that!

940
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.560
I'm always gonna love you
no matter what.

941
01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.520
No matter what happens.

942
01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.560
You're my son and you're my blood.

943
01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.360
You're the best thing in my life.

944
01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:51.240
But until you start believing in
yourself, you ain't gonna have a life.

945
01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.280
Don't forget to visit your mother.

946
01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.640
- Yeah, those are beautiful.
- Yeah.

947
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.480
- You get off early from work?
- No.

948
01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.360
I left.

949
01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.440
I quit.

950
01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.400
Quit, why?

951
01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.040
I wasn't very...

952
01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.640
I don't know, I just...
I didn't fit in there.

953
01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.960
I understand.

954
01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.600
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Right now?

955
01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.520
Right now I'd rather be with you.

956
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.480
Is that all right?

957
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.520
Yeah.

958
01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.560
It's been a long time
since I seen a fight.

959
01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:42.960
You know all there is
to know about fighting...

960
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.040
You know all there is
to know about fighting...

961
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.240
...so there's no sense us going down
that same old road again.

962
01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.360
To beat this guy, you need speed.
You don't have it.

963
01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.600
And your knees can't take the
pounding, so hard running is out.

964
01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.320
And you got arthritis in your neck.
And you've got calcium deposits...

965
01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.680
...on most of your joints,
so sparring is out.

966
01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:06.960
I had that problem.

967
01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.840
So what we'll be calling on is good
old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.

968
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.480
Horsepower. Heavy-duty,
cast-iron, pile-driving punches...

969
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.520
...that will have to hurt so much
they'll rattle his ancestors.

970
01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.760
Every time you hit him with a shot...

971
01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.760
...it's gotta feel like he tried kissing
the express train.

972
01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.800
Yeah! Let's start building
some hurting bombs.

973
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.520
- Yeah, you'll get it.
- You can do it, Rocko!

974
01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.400
Getting stronger!

975
01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.360
- Up! Up! Up!
- Come on!

976
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.440
Go!

977
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.080
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

978
01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.040
Come on, Rocko!

979
01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.360
Come on. Come on.
Let's hit them. Hit them.

980
01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:14.920
You can do it, Rock.

981
01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.080
Getting stronger!

982
01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.400
- Up, up, up!
- Go! Go!

983
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.920
All right!

984
01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.680
Yeah! Yeah!

985
01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.120
Yeah!

986
01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.400
Rocky Balboa, 217!

987
01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:17.000
The undisputed heavyweight
champion, Mason Dixon, 221!

988
01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.760
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.

989
01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:33.120
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

990
01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.440
- Know how much money is in this?
- A lot of it.

991
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.880
Imagine trying to clean this place.

992
01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.360
- No, seriously.
- Balboa!

993
01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.560
You guys, I'll catch up
with you all later, okay?

994
01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.840
Robert, why don't
you hang with me?

995
01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.760
- How you doing, champ?
- I'm good.

996
01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.720
No reason for neither one of us
to get hurt in this fight.

997
01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.760
I'll do my best to carry you,
make sure you save face.

998
01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.640
There'd be no embarrassment.

999
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.960
But I promise you, you try to press me,
you hit me, you hurt me...

1000
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.520
...you hit me low, cheap-shot me,
I'll get you out of there.

1001
01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.920
You know, a lot of people come
to Vegas to lose. I didn't.

1002
01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.360
It's already over.

1003
01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.320
Ain't nothing over till it's over.

1004
01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.080
What's that from, the '80s?

1005
01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.520
That's probably the '70s.

1006
01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.720
Just remember what I said.

1007
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.120
Hey, yo, champ.

1008
01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.920
Yo, ain't you a little scared?

1009
01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.600
I don't get scared.

1010
01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.880
I think you try a little harder
when you're scared.

1011
01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:47.560
This is what has worked for me.

1012
01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.520
- I ain't scared.
- Oh, yeah. You ain't scared of me?

1013
01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.000
Come on, let's see what you got.
Come on.

1014
01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.520
Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.

1015
01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.200
- Hey.
- Hi.

1016
01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.960
- How you doing?
- I was just thinking.

1017
01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.320
- Did you wanna come in?
- No, no, no, it's okay.

1018
01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.560
I just wanted to...

1019
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.400
...I don' t know, come by and wish you
good luck for tomorrow.

1020
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.320
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1021
01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.360
I brought you something.

1022
01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.760
I hope you don't mind,
I took it from the restaurant.

1023
01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.680
- No.
- Thanks.

1024
01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.520
Adrian.

1025
01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.320
Yeah. Thought she would
keep you safe.

1026
01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.840
Yeah. Yeah, she always
brought me luck.

1027
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.640
Yeah.

1028
01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:43.200
I wanted to say thanks for everything
you've done for me and my kid.

1029
01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.800
You've been great and...

1030
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.840
You know, tomorrow...

1031
01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:57.080
...you're gonna prove that the last thing
to age on somebody is their heart.

1032
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.160
- I'll try.
- You go show them.

1033
01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.920
Thank you.

1034
01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.000
<i>The heavyweight championship
has been...</i>

1035
01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.560
<i>... one of sports' most coveted titles
for 120 years.</i>

1036
01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.200
<i>Two-time heavyweight champion
Rocky Balboa...</i>

1037
01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.320
<i>... the Philadelphia slugger,
renowned for his cast-iron jaw...</i>

1038
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.160
<i>... ferocious body attack
and will of steel...</i>

1039
01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.360
<i>... all of which have carried
the smaller fighter to victories...</i>

1040
01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.800
<i>... over the years against
physically superior opponents.</i>

1041
01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.440
<i>And Mason Dixon, the current
heavyweight title holder...</i>

1042
01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.840
<i>... with all the speed, determination
and confidence any fighter could want.</i>

1043
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.800
<i>But many still question whether
he has the heart of a true champion...</i>

1044
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.640
<i>... never having been pushed to go
the distance. Tonight, we find out.</i>

1045
01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.520
<i>Here at the Mandalay Bay
Event Center in Las Vegas...</i>

1046
01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.440
<i>... for the much-anticipated
showdown...</i>

1047
01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.480
<i>... between Mason
"The Line" Dixon...</i>

1048
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.400
<i>... and Rocky
"The Italian Stallion" Balboa.</i>

1049
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.720
Hello, I'm Jim Lampley with
Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman...

1050
01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.920
...live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel
in Las Vegas, where we anticipate...

1051
01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.160
...one of the most outrageous and
compelling events in boxing history.

1052
01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.920
The unappreciated heavyweight
champion, Mason "The Line" Dixon...

1053
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.760
<i>... putting his reputation
on the line...</i>

1054
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.760
<i>... against legendary ex-champion,
Rocky Balboa.</i>

1055
01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.000
<i>Even though most see this as more
of a glorified sparring session...</i>

1056
01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.040
...the energy in the room is electric.

1057
01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.200
Larry, why is this billed
as an exhibition?

1058
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.400
Wild guess: So they wouldn't
have to call it an execution.

1059
01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:45.160
Zacariah 4:6 says,
"It is not by strength, not by might...

1060
01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.920
...but by his spirit
we have already claimed the victory...

1061
01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.680
...in our Lord Jesus Christ."

1062
01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.920
Good luck, Rocky.

1063
01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.240
Thanks, Spider. Appreciate it.

1064
01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.040
Nobody's expecting much, I think,
from the way-past-his-prime...

1065
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.200
...former champ, Rocky Balboa.

1066
01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:15.800
Rock, I gotta talk to you.

1067
01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:22.120
Look, I know you got a lot of stuff
you gotta get out of your system.

1068
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.360
Tonight you do it. Right?
Get rid of the damn beast...

1069
01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:32.200
...let it be done, once and for all.
Please, I love you.

1070
01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.520
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1071
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.360
There go the lights. The buzz is
building toward a roaring crescendo.

1072
01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.720
Where did that come from?

1073
01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.760
I told you. I love Sinatra.

1074
01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.360
He's very good, Sinatra.

1075
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.440
- Let's go.
- Very good.

1076
01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.920
And here comes Rocky Balboa,
veteran of the wars...

1077
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.680
...here for one more last hurrah.

1078
01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.640
Or the Last Supper, perhaps,
with him as the main course.

1079
01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.320
What's that music?
You can't be serious.

1080
01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.120
"High Hopes"?
Talk about wishful thinking.

1081
01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.640
Well, maybe no hopes is more
realistic. Anyway, the crowd likes it.

1082
01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.520
Look at the Italian Stallion.
Cool and relaxed.

1083
01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:40.240
Rocky's an off-the-board underdog,
and they don't care at all.

1084
01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.040
This is about his pride and dignity
and his punch, guys.

1085
01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.680
The last thing to go
is a guy's punch.

1086
01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:50.160
Rocky always has
that puncher's chance.

1087
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.240
Rocky Balboa is still, as you can hear,
the people's champion.

1088
01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.760
Prediction, guys:
For at least two rounds...

1089
01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.600
...Dixon's gonna have
his hands full.

1090
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.600
Two whole rounds? We have
a cockeyed optimist in the house.

1091
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.320
- How you doing?
- The crowd wants to see...

1092
01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.040
...something real, or at least...

1093
01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.160
Rocky Balboa just asked me
how I'm doing.

1094
01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.800
I grew up watching this guy. I never
thought I'd be calling one of his fights.

1095
01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.880
This is unbelievable.
I'm a fan, I can't help it.

1096
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.560
Now here comes Mason Dixon.

1097
01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.760
Mason Dixon establishing
his presence in the ring.

1098
01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:02.560
And suddenly now a conversation
breaking out at ringside.

1099
01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.320
Mike Tyson calling out
Mason "The Line" Dixon.

1100
01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.920
You can't call no shots here.
I'm the champ.

1101
01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.360
You not doing nothing.
This is charity work.

1102
01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.440
You got that midget
with you right there.

1103
01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:21.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Mandalay Bay...

1104
01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.280
...resort and casino of Las Vegas.

1105
01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.800
And a special main event
of the evening...

1106
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.120
...10 rounds of
heavyweight excitement...

1107
01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.600
...sanctioned by the Nevada
State Athletic Commission.

1108
01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.480
And when the bell rings, the referee
in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.

1109
01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:43.200
And now, for the thousands
in attendance...

1110
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.840
...and the millions watching around
the world, ladies and gentlemen...

1111
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.360
...let's get ready to rumble!

1112
01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.720
Introducing first,
fighting out of the blue corner...

1113
01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:04.360
...wearing black with gold,
official weight, 217 pounds.

1114
01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:08.960
His professional record, 57 victories
including 54 knockouts...

1115
01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.040
...with 23 defeats and one draw.

1116
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.240
He is the fighting pride
of Philadelphia...

1117
01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:19.720
...the two-time heavyweight
champion of the world...

1118
01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.880
..."The Italian Stallion"...

1119
01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:26.440
...Rocky...

1120
01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.880
...Balboa!

1121
01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.320
Hope he gets his head busted.

1122
01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.160
Shut up.

1123
01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.480
Across the ring,
fighting out of the red corner...

1124
01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.280
...wearing white with blue,
official weight, 221 pounds.

1125
01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:51.320
He has a perfect professional record,
consisting of 33 bouts...

1126
01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:54.600
...33 victories,
including 30 knockouts.

1127
01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.680
Originally from Tampa, Florida...

1128
01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.720
...but now fighting out
of Las Vegas, Nevada...

1129
01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:04.040
...the reigning undisputed,
undefeated...

1130
01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.080
...heavyweight champion
of the world...

1131
01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.560
...Mason "The Line"...

1132
01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.560
...Dixon!

1133
01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.120
All right, gentlemen.

1134
01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:23.520
All right, Mason, Rocky. We went
over the rules in the dressing room.

1135
01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.520
I expect a good, clean fight. Watch
the kidney punches, rabbit punches...

1136
01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.760
...low blows, be careful with those.
Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.

1137
01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.480
Remember, gentlemen, I'm fair
but I'm firm. Touch them up!

1138
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.120
- Enjoy the ride.
- The champ is not in the best shape...

1139
01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:40.440
...we've seen him in. Maybe he plans
to phone this in and go home early.

1140
01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.920
- That wouldn't be a surprise.
- Glad you could make it.

1141
01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.600
One thing about Rocky
we know for sure:

1142
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.920
This guy's showing up in shape.

1143
01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.800
- The old man's crazy.
- He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.

1144
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.840
- Okay.
- Take it easy. This is an exhibition.

1145
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.400
All right? Do it to him.

1146
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:57.640
You got three rounds to set a pace.
Every time you hit him, make a dent.

1147
01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.680
- Got it.
- The moments before...

1148
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.200
...a Rocky Balboa fight?
I can't believe it's here!

1149
01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.480
Round one begins.

1150
01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:09.160
If old George Foreman shocked
the world with one punch...

1151
01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.360
...why can't old Rocky Balboa?

1152
01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.800
And as much excitement
as there is in the arena...

1153
01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:16.200
...there's a sense of foreboding
as well.

1154
01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.880
And now, Mason "The Line" Dixon
goes to work with his jab as though...

1155
01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.760
...he's fighting against the number one
challenger in the heavyweight division.

1156
01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.000
See, this is to be expected early on.

1157
01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.760
You knew the champ would
control the distance with his jab...

1158
01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.880
...his height, his range.

1159
01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.160
Balboa looking to get in a shot,
misses wildly.

1160
01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:41.080
Did you like that?

1161
01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.520
It looks like a speed bag
against a punching bag.

1162
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.240
Rocky's understandably frustrated...

1163
01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.680
...but he came out of retirement
to get into a fight.

1164
01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.280
Guys named Rocky
don't like to be toyed with.

1165
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.080
One punch could still turn it around.

1166
01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.240
Apparently he forgot
his arthritis meds this morning.

1167
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.960
Rocky misses.

1168
01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.880
There's a meat-seeking missile
on the point of the chin by the champ.

1169
01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.680
<i>- More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.
- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1170
01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.040
And there's a hard right hand
and a left and a right by Balboa!

1171
01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.040
He drives Dixon into the ropes
with a series of shots!

1172
01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.520
And the crowd goes berserk!

1173
01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.280
Dixon punishing Balboa for
the temerity of landing those shots.

1174
01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.040
It's toe to toe in the corner.
Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.

1175
01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.240
Balboa landing potent combinations
to the head of the champion.

1176
01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.760
A wake-up call for Dixon.

1177
01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.480
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1178
01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.720
- The man's got bricks in his gloves.
- Where's the stuff in the basement?

1179
01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.000
- It's still there.
- He came to battle, okay?

1180
01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:49.560
- Trying to knock me out.
- Listen.

1181
01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.040
If there's a bone he can break,
he's gonna do it.

1182
01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.440
- Give the man respect.
- What about my respect?

1183
01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.320
CompuBox numbers
tell the grisly story here.

1184
01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.400
Balboa landed nine of 13
punches in that round.

1185
01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:05.520
Dixon landed an incredible
59 out of 69.

1186
01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.000
- Why don't you listen to me?
- Rocky's been here a million times.

1187
01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.240
Coming out to start a round after
he took a beating in the previous one.

1188
01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:15.440
- Remember what I said, okay?
- I warned him. I warned him.

1189
01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:21.200
He's tired. His legs are going fast,
or already gone.

1190
01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.760
And what's truly extraordinary
is that Rocky can still take it.

1191
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.640
The boxing commission, which
was criticized for licensing him...

1192
01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.880
...would be massacred
if something happened to Rocky.

1193
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.600
And a monstrous straight left hand!
Down goes Rocky!

1194
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.000
And that could conceivably
be the end of the fight!

1195
01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:46.840
That could be the exhibition
right there. But no. Balboa up.

1196
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.120
Referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants
to continue, and Rocky says yes.

1197
01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.040
Even Rocky Balboa could be
too brave for his own good.

1198
01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.640
Dixon comes right back to try to
finish it. Balboa almost went down!

1199
01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.720
Rocky actually shoves Dixon back.

1200
01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:02.320
As Dixon lands these brutal shots.

1201
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.960
- Cover up! Cover up!
- Open shots at close range.

1202
01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.520
Right and left hands,
and down goes Balboa!

1203
01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.920
Perhaps for the last time
in his fighting career!

1204
01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.400
- That should do it.
- Three! Four!

1205
01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.800
Five! Six!

1206
01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.520
Get up! Get up!
- Seven!

1207
01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:19.400
Eight! Nine!

1208
01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:23.880
- How do you feel, man? You okay?
- Now Rocky is furious with himself.

1209
01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.520
He convinces Cortez
he wants to keep fighting.

1210
01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.480
Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it.

1211
01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.640
Rocky waving his arms
and saying he's fine.

1212
01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.880
- He wants to go on!
- Let it go! Let it go!

1213
01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.720
And Balboa comes back!
With a left and a right...

1214
01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.640
...and bulls Dixon into the ropes
for the second round in a row!

1215
01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.240
Back comes Dixon
with brutal left-hand shots.

1216
01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.520
- Dixon hurt his hand there!
- Go after him!

1217
01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.280
This is Rocky's best chance!

1218
01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.600
The champ obviously hurt
his hand on Rocky's hip!

1219
01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:54.440
And Balboa immediately going to
work to the body! Huge right hook!

1220
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.000
Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body!
These are big punches.

1221
01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:01.800
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1222
01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.160
Yes!

1223
01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.800
Rocky Balboa has knocked the
reigning heavyweight champion down!

1224
01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.800
- You hurt him!
- Mason "The Line" Dixon...

1225
01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.920
...has never taken
this kind of punishment...

1226
01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:17.160
...in his entire professional career!

1227
01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:21.160
Maybe he's clearing his head, but
the body shots really caved in his ribs.

1228
01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.880
Balboa is thinking knockout himself!

1229
01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:27.440
Another counterhook by Balboa,
followed by two more!

1230
01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.000
Dixon fires back his own hooks!
Now Rocky's stunned.

1231
01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:32.600
It's an all-out war along the ropes...

1232
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:37.600
...as round two comes to a close
amid a giant tumult in the ring!

1233
01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.800
Incredible.

1234
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.560
All right!

1235
01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.440
Welcome to Rockyland.

1236
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.720
- How's the hand?
- My hand's broken.

1237
01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.680
We lose, it's your ass! Your ass!

1238
01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:56.040
It will numb up on you
in a few rounds.

1239
01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.680
Once that hand numbs up,
Dixon will be able to throw it hard.

1240
01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.120
Until then, here is Rocky's chance.

1241
01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.920
- No reverse!
- Take the pain, champ.

1242
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.760
Stay on him! Everybody thought
this was a joke, including me!

1243
01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:10.440
Now nobody's laughing!
Stay on him! You go get him!

1244
01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.000
Go out strong!

1245
01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.280
Keep him off you!

1246
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:29.960
That's it! That's it!

1247
01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.800
You won that round.
Break him down.

1248
01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.160
Bomb him! Bomb him!

1249
01:23:58.640 --> 01:23:59.800
Yeah!

1250
01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.800
Just keep throwing them bombs!

1251
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.200
Come on.

1252
01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.400
You can do this.

1253
01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.920
Rocko. Rocko.

1254
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.440
Yeah, come on, go!

1255
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.960
Go through him! Run over him!

1256
01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:53.960
Unload on him!

1257
01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:56.680
Get down, Mason!

1258
01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.920
They're leaving nothing
on the table, guys.

1259
01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:14.440
The fans are still standing. They may
not be able to sit down for a week.

1260
01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.280
- You're doing great!
- I'm doing better than I thought.

1261
01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.080
- You sure he's okay?
- I've had worse.

1262
01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.840
Toe to toe, one round to go. Who
would've believed this was possible?

1263
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.240
- Can you see out of that eye?
- Let me talk to him.

1264
01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.600
Don't take any more chances
than you have to.

1265
01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.600
There's nothing more to prove, Pop.
There's nothing more to prove.

1266
01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.800
I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.

1267
01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.480
You can do it, Rocko!

1268
01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.880
- One more round, we go home.
- Okay, then do it.

1269
01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:42.400
There's an old saying that
every great champion has...

1270
01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:47.680
...one great fight left in him,
and Rocky is proving it so far.

1271
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.920
- Come on. Touch them up.
- Rocko! The last round of your life!

1272
01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.640
- Come on, guys.
- The last round!

1273
01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.080
Come on. Touch them up, let's go.
Touch them up.

1274
01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:58.520
- You are one crazy old man.
- You'll get there.

1275
01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.080
Let's go.

1276
01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.480
Tenth round of a scheduled 10.
Who would ever have dreamed...

1277
01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:08.240
...that Rocky Balboa would still be
in this quote, "exhibition," against...

1278
01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.080
...the heavyweight champion?
- You can do it! Come on!

1279
01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:15.400
This fight is as though Dixon
got on-the-job training in courage.

1280
01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.080
- Cover up! Cover up!
- They're both in a pain-free zone!

1281
01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:22.360
These guys are fighting
in another dimension right now!

1282
01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:26.400
Beyond belief! Balboa just walking
straight into Dixon's punches.

1283
01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:29.080
Target practice for Dixon.

1284
01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.760
They're exchanging right hooks!
Balboa's drilled!

1285
01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:38.000
Here comes Dixon! He's exhausted
from just punching the man!

1286
01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.080
Knock this bum out, Mase!

1287
01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.960
<i>What is it you said to the kid?
It ain't about how hard you hit.</i>

1288
01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:01.000
<i>It's about how hard you can get hit
and keep moving forward.</i>

1289
01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:04.840
<i>How much you can take
and keep moving forward.</i>

1290
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.760
<i>- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
- Get up.</i>

1291
01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.800
<i>- Let's go! Get up!
- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1292
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.600
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1293
01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.640
<i>Get up.</i>

1294
01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:37.280
Another monster body shot. Rocky's
ancestors must have felt that one.

1295
01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.440
Come on, Rocky!
Start moving those hands!

1296
01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.280
Less than two minutes to go.

1297
01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.720
The crowd is astonished
that Balboa got up.

1298
01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:46.280
- Come on!
- Turn it over! All the way through!

1299
01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.320
And retaliates with fury!

1300
01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:52.880
Chop him down!

1301
01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.000
Come on, Rocky! Come on!

1302
01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:01.840
Take him out now!

1303
01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.920
They're trading shots again!

1304
01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:08.520
Balboa is trying to hit
anything and anywhere!

1305
01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.040
Win it! Win it!

1306
01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:21.400
Yes!

1307
01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:22.280
Yes!

1308
01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.400
You're a great champion.
You got heart.

1309
01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.240
Thanks for the opportunity.
Good man.

1310
01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:41.120
That was unbelievable. That was
the greatest thing I've ever seen.

1311
01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.800
You did it. That's the kind
of fighting you're talking about.

1312
01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:49.200
Hey, Paulie.

1313
01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:52.120
That beast is gone now.
The beast is out.

1314
01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:55.920
One of the most overused words
in sports, guys, is "incredible."

1315
01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:00.200
I hate to say it. This is incredible.

1316
01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.120
Let's go!

1317
01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:09.280
Ladies and gentlemen,
before we go to the scorecards...

1318
01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:15.280
...a round of applause for these
two heavyweight warriors!

1319
01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:23.560
We have a split decision.

1320
01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:30.760
Adelaide Byrd scores it 95-94...

1321
01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:32.680
...Dixon.

1322
01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.120
Chuck Giampa has it 95-94...

1323
01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.200
...Balboa.

1324
01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:51.720
And Bill Graham scores it 95-94...

1325
01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:56.840
...for the winner by split decision,
and still undefeated...

1326
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.760
...the heavyweight champion
of the world...

1327
01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:05.400
...Mason "The Line" Dixon!

1328
01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:10.560
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1329
01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.960
You know, I couldn't have
done nothing without you.

1330
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.800
Yo, Adrian, we did it.

1331
01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.000
We did it.
