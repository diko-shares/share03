If you get time and maybe
come down and see me train,
I'd appreciate it.

MAN: <i>This plenary session of the
Pennsylvania Athletic Commission</i>

663
00:43:22.683 --> 00:43:28.271
is convened in order to consider
the application of Rocky Balboa

664
00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:32.692
for the issuance of a discretionary
professional boxing license

665
00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.655
due to his ineligibility to be
licensed as a matter of right.

666
00:43:37.823 --> 00:43:41.784
Mr. Balboa, you're welcome here.
Since you're representing yourself,

667
00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:45.079
we invite you to make an opening
statement, if you'd like to.

668
00:43:45.247 --> 00:43:47.832
No, I was just curious
how I did, that's all.

669
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.545
All right, well, the Medical
Advisory Board has informed us

670
00:43:52.713 --> 00:43:55.632
that the battery of tests
to which you've been subjected,

671
00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:59.052
you've passed these tests
with flying colors.

672
00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:01.846
And we congratulate
you for that.

673
00:44:02.014 --> 00:44:04.891
Thanks.
However, this commission,

674
00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:08.853
in good conscience, cannot
recommend you for a license

675
00:44:09.229 --> 00:44:12.440
and we therefore deny
your application.

676
00:44:13.776 --> 00:44:16.569
Didn't I do what you asked?
Yes, you did.

677
00:44:16.737 --> 00:44:18.446
So I should get
a license, right?

678
00:44:18.781 --> 00:44:19.989
Not exactly.

679
00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:26.537
So why did you give me
all them tests if you was
never passing me?

680
00:44:26.705 --> 00:44:32.210
We've gotta stand by our decision
here, and we have to deny your
request for a license at this time.

COMMISSIONER:
What rights do you think
you're referring to?

684
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.188
Like in that official paper
they wrote down the street?

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:54.273
That's the Bill of Rights.
Yeah, yeah. The Bill of Rights.

686
00:44:54.441 --> 00:44:56.693
Don't it say something about going
after what makes you happy?

687
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.612
No, that's "the pursuit of happiness."
But what's your point?

688
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:03.074
My point is I'm pursuing something,
and nobody looks too happy about it.

689
00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:05.743
But we're just looking out
for your interests.

690
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:09.580
I appreciate that, but maybe you're
looking out for your interests more.

691
00:45:09.748 --> 00:45:13.084
You shouldn't ask people
to come here and pay
the freight on something.

692
00:45:13.252 --> 00:45:16.421
They pay, it still ain't good enough.
You think that's right?

Maybe you're doing your job,
but why you gotta stop me
from doing mine?

all the battling to get where
you want to get,

who's got the right to stop you?

696

Maybe you got something you never
finished, something you wanna do.

Who's got the right
to tell you that? Who? Nobody!

It's nobody's right to say no

with both hands tied behind my back.

Everybody knows you
could beat him sitting down.
That's not what it's about.

It's about making money. We gotta
capitalize on that computer fight.
