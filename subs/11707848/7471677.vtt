2
00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.748
Josh, if you
really want to fly,

3
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.451
you need to focus-

4
00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:54.355
I'm preparing to land.

5
00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.232
Which direction is
the wind coming from?

6
00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.165
East.

7
00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.801
Josh, what are you doing?

8
00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:13.305
You've wasted valuable time
because you don't have a plan.

9
00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:15.973
This is the right choice,
there's nothing upwind.

10
00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:19.647
Landing
downwind is difficult.

11
00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.710
It was less than 10
knots, I would have made it.

12
00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:54.782
That was reacting,
it's not a plan.

13
00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:57.683
Josh, I need to
know you're gonna make

14
00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:00.519
the right decision every time.

15
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:01.921
That takes a plan.

16
00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:08.061
I just can't recommend
you for your flight test.

17
00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:09.730
What?

18
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.538
What's the
five types of air space?

19
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.172
Class A through E.

20
00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:22.474
Where is A located?

21
00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.141
Above 18,000.

22
00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:25.777
18,000 what?

23
00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:26.812
Feet.

24
00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:27.978
What kind of feet?

25
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.080
I don't know, feet.

26
00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.081
Feet above what?

27
00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.516
Above sea level.

28
00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.019
18,000 feet MSL.

29
00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:36.688
Above mean sea level.

30
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.491
Don't forget it, or it's wrong.

31
00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.707
You didn't recommend
him for the flight test?

32
00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.943
- No.
- Why not?

33
00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.512
I put him in a
tough situation.

34
00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:02.414
In fact, impossible.

35
00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:05.015
And he would have made it.

36
00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:07.786
He's a natural, the
best I've ever seen.

37
00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:10.288
So why didn't
you recommend him?

38
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.658
I saw what you went through
when your husband died.

39
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.095
I want Josh to have the
judgment to handle anything.

40
00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.298
You're not recommending
him for the Academy.

41
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.669
He's not getting trained
for the CIA, like we were.

42
00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:18.256
Hey, is that your dog?

43
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.491
You better keep him out of here

44
00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:21.862
or I'm gonna call
animal control.

45
00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:41.646
I'm there now.

46
00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:43.981
We will go up
to 30 million dollars.

47
00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:47.519
Just make sure we get the
location that we talked about.

48
00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:50.522
I'm
authorized to make the deal?

49
00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:52.056
Is this going to work?

50
00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.258
It has to.

51
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.694
The CDC risk
assessment came back.

52
00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:58.030
It's worse than we imagined.

53
00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:01.500
Porter, you're on.

54
00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:03.670
Okay, then I'm going in.

55
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:06.036
Collins, wait here.

56
00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:08.573
You're
not going in alone.

57
00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:11.141
If I show up with somebody
they don't know, they'll spook.

58
00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:14.046
Stay here, unless
you hear gunfire.

59
00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:09.970
Do we have a deal?

60
00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:13.941
23 million is a lot of money.

61
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.650
The place is okay,
I will tell you the time.

62
00:06:25.652 --> 00:06:28.219
If the money transfer
does not go through,

63
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.557
the weapon will be released.

64
00:06:46.273 --> 00:06:47.106
Pen?

65
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.747
You're
getting a good plane.

66
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:56.583
Good.

67
00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:09.396
I don't know how
to say this but,

68
00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:12.964
you make me a better person.

69
00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:16.903
And I'm so thankful that
you came into my life.

70
00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:21.006
Will you marry me?

71
00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:33.053
I don't think she's
really your type.

72
00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:36.054
Are we ever gonna be buddies?

73
00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:37.154
Isn't there some
kind of policy

74
00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:39.660
about workplace relationships?

75
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.994
Section 23, article
eight, paragraph B

76
00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:45.162
gives us clearance.

77
00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:46.631
If you really
wanted to get along

78
00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.200
you could have recommended
me for my flight test.

79
00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:50.804
You know I'm ready.

80
00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:17.030
Looks like we'll
have to draw your friend down.

81
00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:19.831
You'll
never find him.

82
00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.669
No, but he may
want to find you.

83
00:08:28.442 --> 00:08:30.043
Time is valuable.

84
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.515
We can't waste another
moment, let's go!

85
00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:51.431
Josh, I have a
message for you.

86
00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:56.568
Landon, say hello to
your little friend.

87
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.503
Josh, don't come up here man,

88
00:08:58.505 --> 00:08:59.971
you'll never make it out alive.

89
00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:01.339
Landon no!

90
00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:02.240
Don't let them?

91
00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:04.109
Listen to me!

92
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.112
That's it.

93
00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:11.284
Enjoy your
candlelight dinner!

94
00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:23.797
Okay!

95
00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:27.532
Landon!

96
00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:30.435
Let's go, the
bomb's gonna blow up, let's go.

97
00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:32.971
- Push the button.
- I don't know

98
00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:34.105
what to do!

99
00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:36.908
I don't know what to do!

100
00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:42.747
You gotta do
something man, come on!

101
00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:57.362
Landon.

102
00:09:57.364 --> 00:10:01.566
Get up bud, I'll be
at your house in 10 minutes.

103
00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:02.636
Yeah, okay.

104
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:30.964
Hey.

105
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.009
What's goin' on
dude, who was that?

106
00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:46.980
Come on, we gotta get.

107
00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:04.562
Why are we even
chasing this guy, man?

108
00:11:04.564 --> 00:11:05.899
What's going on?

109
00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:40.266
You're done,

110
00:11:40.268 --> 00:11:42.734
you're definitely
gettin' a ticket, man.

111
00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:46.106
Well your
son here, he ran a red light.

112
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.379
And, he was going 20 miles
over the speed limit.

113
00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:56.683
And this one here, it's
for reckless driving.

114
00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:03.054
Also looks like
he's been fighting.

115
00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:06.190
Oddly enough, he
wasn't drinking.

116
00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:08.327
Take care of
yourself, young man.

117
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:09.829
Be safe out there.

118
00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:18.838
Josh, your
license, it's been suspended.

119
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.940
Do you understand
how serious this is?

120
00:12:21.942 --> 00:12:22.974
I can explain.

121
00:12:22.976 --> 00:12:24.575
I don't need any excuses.

122
00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.177
He's not your son.

123
00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:27.379
Let's get out of here.

124
00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:29.547
Josh
is very responsible.

125
00:12:29.549 --> 00:12:30.448
Soccer?

126
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.516
Yes.

127
00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:33.319
I understand him all right.

128
00:12:33.321 --> 00:12:35.055
I understand excuses.

129
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:40.326
That's seriously bruised.

130
00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:44.430
Maybe a hairline
fracture, but it's not broken.

131
00:12:44.432 --> 00:12:45.997
But for sure, no soccer.

132
00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.266
What?

133
00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:50.134
Josh has to play,
he's half our offense.

134
00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.772
Well I'm sorry, but not today.

135
00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:00.580
A little friendly advice,

136
00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:03.014
next time think
of your teammates

137
00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:06.117
before you do
something so reckless.

138
00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.153
This is the first time in a
decade we've been this close.

139
00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:11.656
If we win,
we go on to state finals.

140
00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:14.259
Now let's get out there
and bring this trophy home.

141
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:16.094
Henderson on
three, one two three.

142
00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:17.597
Henderson!

143
00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:51.397
As we
all know, Henderson High

144
00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:53.965
was the heavy favorite
to win it all this year.

145
00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:56.834
But it's not lookin'
too good right now.

146
00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.304
Honestly folks, without
their forward striker,

147
00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:01.875
Henderson's struggled all night.

148
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:18.790
That little stunt of yours
is costing us the championship.

149
00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:22.296
Henderson,
Henderson, Henderson.

150
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:31.002
One last
chance, Kevin has the ball.

151
00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:33.004
He gets around one
defender and loses it

152
00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:36.542
to Nicholas Ramsey,
and that's the game.

153
00:14:36.544 --> 00:14:38.210
Conway moves on.

154
00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:41.447
Henderson High is out for
this year's state finals.

155
00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:45.219
They came so close,
but still so far away.

156
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.527
I sure hope
you have a plan for this team.

157
00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:57.362
I don't care if your
forward striker is injured,

158
00:14:57.364 --> 00:14:59.630
how is my son gonna
get a scholarship,

159
00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:02.100
if his team doesn't even
make it to the state finals?

160
00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:06.039
Oh, cross your arms at
me, what is your answer?

161
00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:15.012
You would have made
the difference out there.

162
00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:18.149
You're the only
one who thinks that.

163
00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:19.384
How's your knee.

164
00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:21.018
Oh, about that, I
wanted to explain.

165
00:15:22.523 --> 00:15:23.357
Hold on.

166
00:15:28.596 --> 00:15:30.962
James has called an
emergency meeting tonight

167
00:15:30.964 --> 00:15:32.464
and I have to go.

168
00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:36.301
Is this emergency meeting
just you and Mister Military?

169
00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:38.836
No, it's something different.

170
00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:40.138
Okay.

171
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.340
Well, hey I was wondering,

172
00:15:41.342 --> 00:15:43.174
can I go to Landon's
house tonight?

173
00:15:43.176 --> 00:15:45.676
Yeah sure, but hey, be safe.

174
00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:47.479
You're everything to me.

175
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:48.313
Love ya Mom.

176
00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:49.216
Love you.

177
00:16:04.565 --> 00:16:05.963
In that case,

178
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.301
what about prom?

179
00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:10.437
Are you asking me?

180
00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:13.405
You think too much.

181
00:16:13.407 --> 00:16:16.642
I like to keep
everything organized.

182
00:16:16.644 --> 00:16:17.478
Come on.

183
00:16:27.288 --> 00:16:28.719
Welcome
to the Chesapeake Bay

184
00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:30.558
CIA Operations Center.

185
00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:34.127
Please provide identification.

186
00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:41.633
Identification positive.

187
00:16:41.635 --> 00:16:43.703
Welcome, Agent Lifestone.

188
00:16:45.272 --> 00:16:47.905
Retina,
take me to underground 17.

189
00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:50.342
Voice
recognition confirmed,

190
00:16:50.344 --> 00:16:52.346
elevator now commencing.

191
00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:08.327
Urgent
tactical dispatch.

192
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:11.164
All agents report
to the war room.

193
00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:14.901
All agents report
to the war room.

194
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.736
All agents report
to the war room.

195
00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:20.838
- I
- just saw the assignment.

196
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.773
I'm two blocks from the buy.

197
00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:23.975
Now hold on,

198
00:17:23.977 --> 00:17:26.211
everyone's guarding
an escape route.

199
00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:29.314
Yours is just as
important as the others.

200
00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:30.649
Right.

201
00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:31.983
Now don't get mad at me.

202
00:17:31.985 --> 00:17:35.256
This came down from
Director Glasswell.

203
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.628
Agent Porter has received a
message from the terrorists.

204
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.299
They want
to meet at 1200 hours.

205
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.965
Each of
you now have a map of where

206
00:17:47.967 --> 00:17:49.867
you'll be located
at during the buy.

207
00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:52.404
Once we've identified
the bioweapons,

208
00:17:52.406 --> 00:17:54.439
I'll send everyone in.

209
00:17:54.441 --> 00:17:56.375
We'll shut
down all the area networks.

210
00:17:56.377 --> 00:17:57.875
When the transfer
from this phone

211
00:17:57.877 --> 00:17:59.043
goes all through our network,

212
00:17:59.045 --> 00:18:01.045
where the tracking
virus will be attached.

213
00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:05.753
There is a dangerous weapon
out there on American soil.

214
00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:09.822
Tomorrow
morning everyone, be ready.

215
00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:18.697
I get Shaw.

216
00:18:18.699 --> 00:18:20.465
Come on man,
you always get Shaw.

217
00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:21.966
No I do not.

218
00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:25.205
Well, I'm gonna
win without him then.

219
00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:29.441
I don't know if
you noticed bud but,

220
00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:32.178
you don't really
win at anything.

221
00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.147
I'm messin' with you man.

222
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:37.083
Lighten up.

223
00:18:38.017 --> 00:18:39.785
Show time.

224
00:18:58.272 --> 00:19:00.441
Agent
Porter's in route.

225
00:19:02.776 --> 00:19:04.712
I've
got eyes on him.

226
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.049
They
want me on the bus.

227
00:19:11.585 --> 00:19:13.452
The terrorists
are trying to draw us out.

228
00:19:13.454 --> 00:19:17.222
Stay undercover, but
don't you lose him.

229
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.316
We're at the
meet, he's making contact.

230
00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:35.067
You have the money?

231
00:20:39.673 --> 00:20:41.475
- I
- need the location.

232
00:20:42.942 --> 00:20:45.142
It's outside the warehouse
at Lafayette and Grey Street.

233
00:20:45.144 --> 00:20:46.578
Get me any security cameras

234
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.148
near Lafayette and Gray Street.

235
00:20:56.924 --> 00:20:59.156
Porter, tell them
to open the top,

236
00:20:59.158 --> 00:21:01.595
so we can see the control hub.

237
00:21:04.298 --> 00:21:06.533
Show me the control head.

238
00:21:08.602 --> 00:21:10.437
Show me the canister.

239
00:21:22.916 --> 00:21:27.117
Get me visual verification
on the canister.

240
00:21:30.524 --> 00:21:33.425
All right, we have
the visual feed.

241
00:21:33.427 --> 00:21:34.595
It's verified.

242
00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:36.797
Now the money.

243
00:21:51.845 --> 00:21:53.043
Something's wrong.

244
00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.679
Another area network
just appeared.

245
00:21:54.681 --> 00:21:57.849
The weapon is more
important, give them the money.

246
00:21:57.851 --> 00:21:59.551
We could lose everything.

247
00:21:59.553 --> 00:22:02.854
I can't shut down
this network in time.

248
00:22:02.856 --> 00:22:05.457
The payment's been authorized.

249
00:22:05.459 --> 00:22:08.228
Put your routing
numbers in here.

250
00:22:09.696 --> 00:22:11.798
This better go through.

251
00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:28.315
I'll keep the phone.

252
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.317
Anything goes wrong, I'll
put bullet through canister

253
00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:34.021
before you get there.

254
00:22:52.039 --> 00:22:53.838
What
does your mom do?

255
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.410
She's an
accountant, I think.

256
00:22:57.411 --> 00:22:59.046
Sounds really fun.

257
00:23:00.747 --> 00:23:02.714
She works on a Saturday?

258
00:23:02.716 --> 00:23:05.016
Yeah, bureaucrats,

259
00:23:05.018 --> 00:23:08.520
who knows what
constitutes an emergency?

260
00:23:08.522 --> 00:23:09.588
She probably starts her day

261
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.791
by sitting behind her big desk.

262
00:23:12.793 --> 00:23:15.694
Then she probably
pulls out her files,

263
00:23:15.696 --> 00:23:18.799
and then begins to
input the numbers.

264
00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:22.434
I'm sure she gets her coffee

265
00:23:22.436 --> 00:23:26.105
so that she's got enough
energy for the day.

266
00:23:46.693 --> 00:23:49.294
Don't
do anything stupid.

267
00:23:49.296 --> 00:23:50.864
Okay, just relax.

268
00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:54.733
We got the 23 million.

269
00:23:54.735 --> 00:23:57.469
And now we get you
for the insurance.

270
00:23:57.471 --> 00:24:01.573
Then, she probably
starts crunching the numbers.

271
00:24:01.575 --> 00:24:03.241
23 million?

272
00:24:03.243 --> 00:24:05.443
You think we're
ignorant of the CIA?

273
00:24:05.445 --> 00:24:08.448
We got the money,
we got the weapon.

274
00:24:21.828 --> 00:24:24.097
Careful, it may be armed.

275
00:24:45.652 --> 00:24:46.753
It's empty.

276
00:24:48.021 --> 00:24:50.455
Director Glasswell,

277
00:24:50.457 --> 00:24:52.191
the canister's empty.

278
00:24:54.561 --> 00:24:55.827
Are you working with Porter?

279
00:24:55.829 --> 00:24:57.829
Porter is nobody.

280
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:00.031
We work with who we
want to work with.

281
00:25:00.033 --> 00:25:01.968
Now, we work with you.

282
00:25:07.774 --> 00:25:09.240
After that,

283
00:25:09.242 --> 00:25:11.078
files all the reports.

284
00:25:15.449 --> 00:25:17.684
And that's her day at work.

285
00:25:22.355 --> 00:25:23.523
I'm sure it's,

286
00:25:26.026 --> 00:25:27.027
quite a job.

287
00:25:29.129 --> 00:25:31.696
Iris, call James Whitmore.

288
00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:34.367
Calling James Whitmore.

289
00:25:36.837 --> 00:25:38.236
Hi, this is James.

290
00:25:38.238 --> 00:25:40.839
Please leave a message.

291
00:25:40.841 --> 00:25:43.475
Wish I could
do something like that.

292
00:25:43.477 --> 00:25:44.311
Yeah.

293
00:25:45.712 --> 00:25:47.378
Iris, call Josh.

294
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.816
Calling Josh Morgan.

295
00:26:03.063 --> 00:26:05.231
Come on Josh, pick up.

296
00:26:05.233 --> 00:26:08.199
I really need to speak to you.

297
00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:09.968
Text Josh STINGRAY.

298
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.936
Did you mean, Stingr?

299
00:26:11.938 --> 00:26:13.605
Give me the phone.

300
00:26:13.607 --> 00:26:15.442
Message sent.

301
00:26:17.944 --> 00:26:20.013
What did you do to him?

302
00:26:35.862 --> 00:26:37.265
Pause the game.

303
00:26:48.542 --> 00:26:52.110
If we still have the money,
they'll have to renegotiate.

304
00:26:52.112 --> 00:26:53.311
They'll have to.

305
00:26:53.313 --> 00:26:54.813
We
didn't get the trace.

306
00:26:54.815 --> 00:26:56.314
That was
supposed to be impossible.

307
00:26:56.316 --> 00:27:00.385
Sir, the trace
went through another server.

308
00:27:00.387 --> 00:27:04.424
Collins, stay on 'em
until we get the canister.

309
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:09.394
- I
- have tryouts next week

310
00:27:09.396 --> 00:27:12.564
and these distractions
just keep coming up.

311
00:27:12.566 --> 00:27:14.599
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

312
00:27:14.601 --> 00:27:16.568
I told you not to follow.

313
00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:17.969
Hold on one second.

314
00:27:17.971 --> 00:27:20.640
I'm not following you, back off.

315
00:27:22.276 --> 00:27:26.112
This guy thinks I'm
following him, he's crazy.

316
00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.648
They have Lifestone.

317
00:27:32.719 --> 00:27:36.087
30 million
dollars, and a lost agent.

318
00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:39.123
Does somebody want to tell
me what went wrong here?

319
00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:41.862
We're
reviewing everything sir.

320
00:27:45.098 --> 00:27:48.666
They had to know our protocols
to make the transfer work.

321
00:27:48.668 --> 00:27:51.337
I want Lifestone found.

322
00:27:51.339 --> 00:27:53.137
Whatever it takes.

323
00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:55.373
You need it, it's approved.

324
00:27:55.375 --> 00:27:58.312
I want her back
alive and unharmed.

325
00:27:59.646 --> 00:28:01.748
Riely, find me that money.

326
00:28:02.916 --> 00:28:05.785
Talk to the NSA,
get me that money.

327
00:28:07.387 --> 00:28:10.256
Porter, you're with
Special Agent Whitmore.

328
00:28:10.258 --> 00:28:12.857
Let's go everybody,
get me some answers.

329
00:28:12.859 --> 00:28:13.693
Yes sir.

330
00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:22.700
Okay people let's go.

331
00:28:22.702 --> 00:28:24.971
We've got an agent to find.

332
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:38.219
Hey Mom, I'm home.

333
00:28:41.054 --> 00:28:41.888
Mom?

334
00:28:51.232 --> 00:28:52.565
Mister Whitmore.

335
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.101
Josh, sit down.

336
00:29:18.359 --> 00:29:20.261
Who's Colt Lifestone?

337
00:29:22.229 --> 00:29:23.063
You are.

338
00:29:25.065 --> 00:29:26.698
Towards the end of the Cold War,

339
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.733
the Soviet Union made
thousands of liters

340
00:29:28.735 --> 00:29:31.102
of biological weapons.

341
00:29:31.104 --> 00:29:34.939
There were stored in
warehouses all across Russia.

342
00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:38.676
Over the last 30 years,
we've been buying it up.

343
00:29:38.678 --> 00:29:39.579
Who's we?

344
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.984
The CIA.

345
00:29:45.552 --> 00:29:47.821
Your parents worked for us.

346
00:29:48.989 --> 00:29:52.158
Your father was a
great American hero.

347
00:29:53.727 --> 00:29:55.396
My Mom's an agent?

348
00:29:57.797 --> 00:29:58.631
Yeah.

349
00:30:01.302 --> 00:30:03.036
A buy went bad today.

350
00:30:04.738 --> 00:30:08.039
I don't know how
to tell you this.

351
00:30:08.041 --> 00:30:09.609
Your Mom's missing.

352
00:30:18.084 --> 00:30:20.820
Does this mean
anything to you?

353
00:30:40.408 --> 00:30:43.074
Josh, she texted you
right at the moment

354
00:30:43.076 --> 00:30:44.878
that she was captured.

355
00:30:49.483 --> 00:30:52.251
This must mean something.

356
00:30:52.253 --> 00:30:53.218
I'm not gettin' anything,

357
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.185
I don't think she ever said that

358
00:30:54.187 --> 00:30:56.888
or used that as a password.

359
00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.324
If you come up
with anything, let me know.

360
00:30:59.326 --> 00:31:01.859
Your Mom's life
could depend on it.

361
00:31:01.861 --> 00:31:03.696
Oh, Mister Whitmore,

362
00:31:04.564 --> 00:31:06.731
about that speeding ticket.

363
00:31:06.733 --> 00:31:08.099
Don't worry about that.

364
00:31:08.101 --> 00:31:09.334
We're past that.

365
00:31:09.336 --> 00:31:11.470
No no, I walked outside,

366
00:31:11.472 --> 00:31:13.905
someone was doing something
underneath your vehicle.

367
00:31:13.907 --> 00:31:15.773
So I approached him,
he hit and raced off.

368
00:31:15.775 --> 00:31:17.710
That's why we followed.

369
00:31:28.556 --> 00:31:31.122
This still works out.

370
00:31:31.124 --> 00:31:32.690
Everyone was
supposed to get what they wanted

371
00:31:32.692 --> 00:31:36.060
while we got some of the money.

372
00:31:36.062 --> 00:31:38.164
They owe us that money.

373
00:31:40.633 --> 00:31:44.336
Man, I didn't
see this going bad.

374
00:31:44.338 --> 00:31:46.405
We take care of
the kid for a while.

375
00:31:46.407 --> 00:31:48.507
You feel remorse
with what happened,

376
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:49.809
and then resign.

377
00:31:51.479 --> 00:31:53.780
It's almost better this way.

378
00:31:57.083 --> 00:31:59.016
I'll have agent
Dewitt Porter and his wife

379
00:31:59.018 --> 00:32:03.054
take you to a safe house until
we get this all figured out.

380
00:32:03.056 --> 00:32:04.789
Are they both CIA too?

381
00:32:04.791 --> 00:32:06.860
No, only Mister Porter.

382
00:32:08.094 --> 00:32:09.495
Do you trust him?

383
00:32:09.497 --> 00:32:10.331
Yes.

384
00:32:12.832 --> 00:32:15.267
There is one more thing.

385
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:17.469
Every agent writes a will,

386
00:32:17.471 --> 00:32:20.640
in case they're
killed in active duty.

387
00:32:22.243 --> 00:32:26.079
I think it's time that
you read your father's.

388
00:32:34.754 --> 00:32:37.054
My
name is Charles Lifestone.

389
00:32:37.056 --> 00:32:39.826
I'm a special
agent with the CIA.

390
00:32:43.364 --> 00:32:47.466
If you're reading this, it
means I'm no longer here.

391
00:32:47.468 --> 00:32:51.203
Colt, if I don't get to
tell you this in person,

392
00:32:51.205 --> 00:32:53.905
there's some things
you need to know.

393
00:32:53.907 --> 00:32:55.240
A few years ago I
led an operation

394
00:32:55.242 --> 00:32:58.176
that put our family in danger.

395
00:32:58.178 --> 00:32:59.545
Because of this
we had to relocate

396
00:32:59.547 --> 00:33:01.781
and take on different names.

397
00:33:47.093 --> 00:33:50.061
Today we are gathered in
celebration of the memory

398
00:33:50.063 --> 00:33:52.397
of Charles Lifestone.

399
00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:53.532
I'm
sorry you had to grow up

400
00:33:53.534 --> 00:33:57.034
never really
knowing who you are.

401
00:33:57.036 --> 00:34:01.074
There's so many questions
that may go unanswered.

402
00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:06.877
But beyond time and space
is a God that created you,

403
00:34:06.879 --> 00:34:08.047
who loves you.

404
00:34:15.088 --> 00:34:18.157
Jesus
said, "This is eternal life."

405
00:34:20.594 --> 00:34:22.862
Just know this,

406
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.164
wherever you go,

407
00:34:26.333 --> 00:34:27.834
you are not alone.

408
00:34:49.188 --> 00:34:52.025
Colt
Lifestone, it's time to go.

409
00:34:56.297 --> 00:34:57.231
That's you.

410
00:35:00.434 --> 00:35:01.235
Let's go.

411
00:35:03.337 --> 00:35:07.441
No cell phones, computers,
or anything traceable?

412
00:35:08.609 --> 00:35:10.141
Oh wait,
one more thing.

413
00:35:10.143 --> 00:35:12.979
Oreo!

414
00:35:25.392 --> 00:35:27.795
I'm not leaving without Oreo.

415
00:35:34.834 --> 00:35:36.735
We're trying to protect you.

416
00:35:36.737 --> 00:35:38.305
Now get in the car.

417
00:35:41.442 --> 00:35:42.842
Get in the car.

418
00:37:28.047 --> 00:37:29.548
We're here.

419
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.416
I hate Conway.

420
00:37:31.418 --> 00:37:33.150
Welcome to the club.

421
00:37:33.152 --> 00:37:35.389
I hate their soccer team.

422
00:37:43.129 --> 00:37:43.963
Come on.

423
00:37:50.737 --> 00:37:51.969
Here's some games,

424
00:37:51.971 --> 00:37:55.640
let me know if you
need any others.

425
00:37:55.642 --> 00:37:58.677
I can play as much as I want?

426
00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:00.312
Yeah.

427
00:38:00.314 --> 00:38:03.750
And you can eat as
much pizza as you want.

428
00:38:47.828 --> 00:38:48.662
Stinger.

429
00:38:50.129 --> 00:38:50.964
Stingray!

430
00:38:54.434 --> 00:38:56.100
I've made up my mind.

431
00:38:56.102 --> 00:38:57.771
I'm going to school.

432
00:38:59.038 --> 00:39:00.305
You can't.

433
00:39:00.307 --> 00:39:01.107
Why not?

434
00:39:05.245 --> 00:39:07.979
Because I won't let
something happen to you.

435
00:39:07.981 --> 00:39:11.550
What she means is, you can't
just walk into a new school.

436
00:39:11.552 --> 00:39:12.484
We have to file the paperwork

437
00:39:12.486 --> 00:39:13.785
with the local school districts.

438
00:39:13.787 --> 00:39:16.288
So you can transfer in quietly,

439
00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:18.959
without raising any red flags.

440
00:40:14.881 --> 00:40:16.180
On our wet list,

441
00:40:16.182 --> 00:40:19.751
these terrorists would
be the top suspects.

442
00:40:19.753 --> 00:40:21.118
Thank you, MI6.

443
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.053
Indeed.

444
00:40:22.055 --> 00:40:23.521
Agent Riely,

445
00:40:23.523 --> 00:40:26.324
We need to know
where that weapon is.

446
00:40:26.326 --> 00:40:28.259
I'm uploading the footage
from the security cameras

447
00:40:28.261 --> 00:40:29.928
to Retina right now.

448
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:34.668
Agent Riely, let me know as
soon as you have something.

449
00:40:36.903 --> 00:40:40.137
Calculating,
please hold.

450
00:40:40.139 --> 00:40:42.174
Calculating, please hold.

451
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:44.945
Calculating, please-

452
00:40:46.145 --> 00:40:49.581
Over 10,000
potential matches.

453
00:40:49.583 --> 00:40:51.950
Retina, could you narrow
that down a little bit?

454
00:40:51.952 --> 00:40:54.653
Insufficient
data collected.

455
00:40:54.655 --> 00:40:57.457
Lacking information,
input detail.

456
00:40:59.526 --> 00:41:00.560
Input detail.

457
00:41:25.419 --> 00:41:27.986
So you're
available at 10:36 a.m.?

458
00:41:27.988 --> 00:41:30.789
No, I'm helping
Amber study for biology.

459
00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:33.458
Oh, well I could join you.

460
00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.192
I'm sorry, I
really can't acquire

461
00:41:35.194 --> 00:41:37.729
any more academically
challenged students.

462
00:41:37.731 --> 00:41:39.330
Oh well, you don't
have to worry about that.

463
00:41:39.332 --> 00:41:41.768
At my last school I was like...

464
00:41:50.243 --> 00:41:52.546
That girl is something else.

465
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.483
It's
simple, just remember

466
00:41:58.485 --> 00:42:01.152
that homeostasis is a tendency
of an organism or cell

467
00:42:01.154 --> 00:42:02.954
to regulate its
internal conditions,

468
00:42:02.956 --> 00:42:06.291
usually by a system
of feedback controls.

469
00:42:06.293 --> 00:42:07.459
It's just so hard.

470
00:42:07.461 --> 00:42:09.527
I wish it was just
numbers and made sense.

471
00:42:09.529 --> 00:42:11.563
Amber, think of it as math.

472
00:42:11.565 --> 00:42:12.733
HIGHSCHOOL
PRINCIPAL: Josh Morgan?

473
00:42:13.934 --> 00:42:17.135
Could I speak with
you for a moment?

474
00:42:21.675 --> 00:42:25.043
Your transcripts from
Henderson just arrived.

475
00:42:25.045 --> 00:42:27.712
If you plan on graduating,

476
00:42:27.714 --> 00:42:30.550
you're going to
have to work hard.

477
00:42:40.827 --> 00:42:44.429
Josh Morgan,
what are you doing here?

478
00:42:44.431 --> 00:42:46.131
Just transferred.

479
00:42:46.133 --> 00:42:47.599
Did Henderson kick you out?

480
00:42:47.601 --> 00:42:49.235
Or were you just too afraid
to show your face there

481
00:42:49.237 --> 00:42:51.469
after letting everyone down?

482
00:42:53.673 --> 00:42:55.207
Look at the new kid.

483
00:42:55.209 --> 00:42:57.976
Oh, I definitely
have to go meet him.

484
00:42:57.978 --> 00:43:00.345
You mean, I
have to go meet him.

485
00:43:00.347 --> 00:43:03.448
Ladies, let's invite him
to our table for lunch.

486
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:04.983
Yeah.

487
00:43:04.985 --> 00:43:07.185
My name is Kelly, but you
can call me Kell for short.

488
00:43:07.187 --> 00:43:08.686
And I'm Sarah.

489
00:43:08.688 --> 00:43:09.988
You'll definitely
want to hang out with us

490
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:12.993
if you want to be
popular at Conway.

491
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.297
Hey ladies.

492
00:43:18.298 --> 00:43:20.232
I'm Sarah, I'm Kelly.

493
00:43:20.234 --> 00:43:23.904
Do they think about
anything but themselves.

494
00:43:25.172 --> 00:43:26.604
Nope.

495
00:43:26.606 --> 00:43:28.740
I mean why are they
hanging out with him anyway?

496
00:43:28.742 --> 00:43:31.509
So, what
brought you to Conway?

497
00:43:31.511 --> 00:43:34.479
Well, it
was my parents' job.

498
00:43:34.481 --> 00:43:37.182
Oh,
where do they work?

499
00:43:37.184 --> 00:43:39.884
They work at an organization.

500
00:43:39.886 --> 00:43:43.289
What kind
of an organization?

501
00:43:43.291 --> 00:43:46.524
One that's by the
people, for the people,

502
00:43:46.526 --> 00:43:47.694
of the people.

503
00:43:49.162 --> 00:43:52.130
Why are guys always trying
to be something they're not?

504
00:43:52.132 --> 00:43:53.865
I think
it depends on how you-

505
00:43:53.867 --> 00:43:55.466
Are we
talking about Nicholas?

506
00:43:55.468 --> 00:43:56.334
Or the new kid?

507
00:43:56.336 --> 00:43:58.536
Or guys I don't know?

508
00:43:58.538 --> 00:44:02.175
Seriously Jackson, do
you have to even ask?

509
00:44:11.219 --> 00:44:12.483
Hey bruh?

510
00:44:12.485 --> 00:44:14.118
Hey.

511
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.189
My man, let's hang out.

512
00:44:17.157 --> 00:44:17.991
Jackson!

513
00:44:21.295 --> 00:44:23.895
We'll have to
go to your house.

514
00:44:23.897 --> 00:44:26.164
Yeah, I think we
can make that work.

515
00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:27.000
Great.

516
00:44:35.408 --> 00:44:38.578
Fingerprint
identification required.

517
00:44:40.981 --> 00:44:42.216
Access granted.

518
00:44:52.959 --> 00:44:54.459
My room's upstairs.

519
00:44:54.461 --> 00:44:55.593
Hey, I'm home.

520
00:44:55.595 --> 00:44:57.161
I got a friend with me.

521
00:44:57.163 --> 00:45:00.098
Oh, you
made a new friend already?

522
00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:00.901
How nice.

523
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.270
Can I talk to you for a moment?

524
00:45:04.272 --> 00:45:05.105
Alone?

525
00:45:06.006 --> 00:45:07.138
I'll be right up.

526
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.173
First door on the right.

527
00:45:09.175 --> 00:45:11.142
What are you doing
bringing someone here?

528
00:45:11.144 --> 00:45:12.378
It's a friend.

529
00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.912
If you want to
keep going to school?

530
00:45:13.914 --> 00:45:17.216
You better not make
any more friends.

531
00:45:17.218 --> 00:45:18.149
Okay.

532
00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:20.319
Your flight test is tomorrow.

533
00:45:20.321 --> 00:45:22.887
And if he's not
out of here pronto,

534
00:45:22.889 --> 00:45:23.723
forget it.

535
00:45:34.467 --> 00:45:36.567
Ever played
Stingray before?

536
00:45:36.569 --> 00:45:38.503
No. What's Stingray?

537
00:45:38.505 --> 00:45:41.706
It's a game about
finding a corrupt agent.

538
00:45:41.708 --> 00:45:43.109
That's awesome.

539
00:45:44.544 --> 00:45:47.614
It's a game about
finding... Stingray?

540
00:45:48.648 --> 00:45:49.482
Stingray?

541
00:45:50.583 --> 00:45:53.853
It's a game about
finding a corrupt agent.

542
00:45:54.688 --> 00:45:55.522
Josh?

543
00:45:56.424 --> 00:45:57.522
You all right?

544
00:45:57.524 --> 00:45:58.359
Yeah.

545
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.301
Hey, I got intel.

546
00:46:09.303 --> 00:46:10.735
Yeah he does.

547
00:46:10.737 --> 00:46:14.072
Intel, short for
intelligence, information, news,

548
00:46:14.074 --> 00:46:15.441
new understanding.

549
00:46:15.443 --> 00:46:16.674
Yeah, all that stuff.

550
00:46:16.676 --> 00:46:20.111
That Josh kid is something else.

551
00:46:20.113 --> 00:46:21.713
Yeah, sure he is.

552
00:46:21.715 --> 00:46:23.548
No really, he has parents

553
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.018
that threaten him not to make
any more friends at school.

554
00:47:07.027 --> 00:47:09.827
And so on behalf
of Havenhurst University,

555
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:13.631
I am delighted to welcome
former US Secretary of Defense,

556
00:47:13.633 --> 00:47:15.535
Doctor Alistair Walker.

557
00:47:24.544 --> 00:47:27.111
Thank you, thank you all.

558
00:47:27.113 --> 00:47:28.579
It is my honor to be here.

559
00:47:28.581 --> 00:47:30.882
Thank you
so much for being with us.

560
00:47:30.884 --> 00:47:32.817
So let's get right
to it, shall we?

561
00:47:32.819 --> 00:47:36.854
What was the most challenging
moment in your career?

562
00:47:36.856 --> 00:47:38.223
Well,
every moment's challenging

563
00:47:38.225 --> 00:47:41.795
when national security
depends on your job.

564
00:47:42.962 --> 00:47:44.296
You may be surprised to hear it,

565
00:47:44.298 --> 00:47:46.731
but one of my biggest headaches

566
00:47:46.733 --> 00:47:48.933
actually came out of Cold War.

567
00:47:48.935 --> 00:47:52.003
The Cold War, well let's
talk about the Cold War then.

568
00:47:52.005 --> 00:47:54.273
What can you tell us about
the biological weapons

569
00:47:54.275 --> 00:47:57.545
that Russia developed
during that time?

570
00:48:01.881 --> 00:48:04.849
Can I
help you find something?

571
00:48:04.851 --> 00:48:06.418
I think
I just found it.

572
00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.353
Then
hypothetically speaking,

573
00:48:08.355 --> 00:48:11.823
if Russia still has
weapons of that nature,

574
00:48:11.825 --> 00:48:15.126
what kind of damage
could they do.

575
00:48:15.128 --> 00:48:16.428
We believe that with

576
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:18.863
this particular
biological agent,

577
00:48:18.865 --> 00:48:22.834
a single canister could
kill nearly everyone

578
00:48:22.836 --> 00:48:24.438
in a major US city.

579
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.873
And
how long would it take

580
00:48:28.875 --> 00:48:32.145
for that biological
agent to take effect?

581
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.713
With
an airborne release,

582
00:48:35.715 --> 00:48:37.181
hours.

583
00:48:37.183 --> 00:48:38.751
Doing some research?

584
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.355
No, just
studying chemistry.

585
00:48:43.357 --> 00:48:44.956
Bioweapons?

586
00:48:44.958 --> 00:48:48.092
Josh, what are you
really doing at Conway?

587
00:48:48.094 --> 00:48:50.628
Okay, it's kind
of complicated,

588
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:54.401
but it really is because
of my parents' work.

589
00:48:55.835 --> 00:48:59.271
I am really good at math,
and none of this adds up.

590
00:48:59.273 --> 00:49:01.172
Hey, I might have
stretched the truth

591
00:49:01.174 --> 00:49:02.608
a little bit yesterday,

592
00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:07.381
but I can be a good study
partner if you give me a chance.

593
00:49:18.791 --> 00:49:21.895
And, I even brought
some inspiration.

594
00:49:23.663 --> 00:49:25.232
How did you know?

595
00:49:29.035 --> 00:49:32.138
I have to confess,
Jackson told me.

596
00:50:04.771 --> 00:50:06.804
You
did an excellent job.

597
00:50:06.806 --> 00:50:08.072
Who was your instructor?

598
00:50:08.074 --> 00:50:10.841
It was James Whitmore.

599
00:50:10.843 --> 00:50:12.977
Hmm, I don't know him.

600
00:50:12.979 --> 00:50:14.546
But he must be good.

601
00:50:14.548 --> 00:50:17.982
That was the nicest check
ride I've seen in years.

602
00:50:17.984 --> 00:50:19.685
Congratulations.

603
00:50:19.687 --> 00:50:21.453
That is your
temporary certificate.

604
00:50:21.455 --> 00:50:24.692
You are now officially
a private pilot.

605
00:50:30.763 --> 00:50:33.532
Excuse
me, Mister Porter?

606
00:50:33.534 --> 00:50:34.832
I think I know what my
mom was trying to tell

607
00:50:34.834 --> 00:50:38.270
Mister Whitmore with
the text she sent me.

608
00:50:38.272 --> 00:50:39.904
What do you mean?

609
00:50:39.906 --> 00:50:41.172
I think she was
trying to tell me

610
00:50:41.174 --> 00:50:44.909
there's a corrupt
agent on the inside.

611
00:50:44.911 --> 00:50:46.712
Why would you think that?

612
00:50:46.714 --> 00:50:48.413
Well her message, 'stingr',

613
00:50:48.415 --> 00:50:51.115
is a reference to a video
game that she knew I played.

614
00:50:51.117 --> 00:50:53.987
It's about finding
a corrupt agent.

615
00:50:58.659 --> 00:50:59.792
Video games?

616
00:51:00.793 --> 00:51:01.993
I don't think so,

617
00:51:01.995 --> 00:51:05.198
we've got procedures
for this kind of thing.

618
00:51:06.833 --> 00:51:09.836
But I love your
imagination, though.

619
00:51:15.709 --> 00:51:18.410
Everyone please
read pages 128 through 193

620
00:51:18.412 --> 00:51:20.479
for next Thursday's class.

621
00:51:20.481 --> 00:51:22.547
What makes history
great are the villains,

622
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:25.149
the hooligans, and the heroes.

623
00:51:25.151 --> 00:51:26.487
Class dismissed.

624
00:51:30.557 --> 00:51:31.590
Jackson's
mom always gives us

625
00:51:31.592 --> 00:51:33.926
way too much work and tests.

626
00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:38.430
I think
she's a great teacher.

627
00:51:38.432 --> 00:51:40.798
I love her stories.

628
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.635
Yeah.

629
00:51:43.036 --> 00:51:46.271
So what's with you hanging
out with that new kid?

630
00:51:46.273 --> 00:51:47.506
I don't hang out
with the new kid.

631
00:51:47.508 --> 00:51:49.310
I don't even like him.

632
00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:57.982
So he thinks
there's a corrupt agent,

633
00:51:57.984 --> 00:52:00.117
that changes nothing.

634
00:52:00.119 --> 00:52:01.919
It
changes everything. If

635
00:52:01.921 --> 00:52:06.491
they catch the terrorists,
they'll find out about the money.

636
00:52:06.493 --> 00:52:09.229
Or, we just get
rid of the kid.

637
00:52:11.197 --> 00:52:12.198
If I have-

638
00:52:13.367 --> 00:52:14.899
- Josh?

639
00:52:14.901 --> 00:52:16.535
There's been a security breach.

640
00:52:16.537 --> 00:52:17.902
You cannot leave the
house until the threat

641
00:52:17.904 --> 00:52:19.371
has been eliminated.

642
00:52:19.373 --> 00:52:21.740
But I have a history test
Friday, I have to go to school.

643
00:52:21.742 --> 00:52:24.108
The test is going
to have to wait.

644
00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:26.447
We have to control the risk.

645
00:52:46.734 --> 00:52:48.633
That's time,
please close your test booklets,

646
00:52:48.635 --> 00:52:50.804
and put your pencils down.

647
00:52:56.844 --> 00:52:59.444
Next week, we'll be looking
at heroes in history.

648
00:52:59.446 --> 00:53:00.647
What is a hero?

649
00:53:01.582 --> 00:53:03.250
Anyone in the NFL?

650
00:53:04.318 --> 00:53:05.817
Movie stars.

651
00:53:05.819 --> 00:53:08.222
Ones that play superheroes.

652
00:53:09.423 --> 00:53:12.022
Talented people aren't
necessarily heroes.

653
00:53:12.024 --> 00:53:13.991
What really makes a hero?

654
00:53:25.972 --> 00:53:28.440
Has anyone
seen Josh today?

655
00:53:28.442 --> 00:53:29.641
No.

656
00:53:29.643 --> 00:53:31.175
Haven't
seen him all morning.

657
00:53:31.177 --> 00:53:33.077
Okay, he doesn't
even have a cell phone.

658
00:53:33.079 --> 00:53:35.747
That's cruel
and unusual punishment.

659
00:53:35.749 --> 00:53:38.216
It's not punishment,
it's just his parents.

660
00:53:38.218 --> 00:53:39.917
So you know his parents?

661
00:53:39.919 --> 00:53:42.821
Why I don't you go ask them?

662
00:53:42.823 --> 00:53:45.325
Hey Demi, wait up.

663
00:53:54.066 --> 00:53:56.403
This
is so sweet, Jackson.

664
00:53:57.604 --> 00:54:00.207
I'll totally go
to prom with you.

665
00:54:36.108 --> 00:54:37.642
Can't
you read, no soliciting?

666
00:54:37.644 --> 00:54:39.578
I'm just
here to see Josh.

667
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.745
And you are?

668
00:54:40.747 --> 00:54:42.916
Alice Jones from school.

669
00:54:44.218 --> 00:54:47.419
Well, Alice Jones from school,

670
00:54:47.421 --> 00:54:48.489
Josh is sick.

671
00:56:32.392 --> 00:56:34.426
I thought
you were sick?

672
00:56:34.428 --> 00:56:36.195
I need help.

673
00:56:37.064 --> 00:56:40.164
Well that, I already knew.

674
00:56:40.166 --> 00:56:43.969
I'm not the guy
who you think I am.

675
00:56:43.971 --> 00:56:48.140
Josh, you're not the guy
anybody thinks you are.

676
00:56:51.211 --> 00:56:53.313
My name Colt Lifestone.

677
00:56:54.781 --> 00:56:56.883
My mom works for the CIA.

678
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:59.151
Seriously?

679
00:57:05.092 --> 00:57:08.125
Now we're gettin' somewhere.

680
00:57:08.127 --> 00:57:09.628
The Porters aren't my parents.

681
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:12.597
Mister Porter's an agent,
and Sheila is his wife.

682
00:57:12.599 --> 00:57:15.433
They're just watching
me temporarily.

683
00:57:15.435 --> 00:57:17.102
What happened to
your real parents?

684
00:57:17.104 --> 00:57:18.970
Well, my dad died
when I was seven,

685
00:57:18.972 --> 00:57:20.472
and my mom went
missing a few days ago

686
00:57:20.474 --> 00:57:22.774
in an op that went wrong.

687
00:57:22.776 --> 00:57:23.610
Wow.

688
00:57:24.711 --> 00:57:26.244
Wait is she?

689
00:57:26.246 --> 00:57:29.483
I don't know, but
I'm gonna find out.

690
00:57:31.818 --> 00:57:34.184
Why don't you just
leave this to the CIA?

691
00:57:34.186 --> 00:57:35.122
We can't.

692
00:57:37.958 --> 00:57:40.725
There's a corrupt
agent on the inside.

693
00:57:40.727 --> 00:57:41.960
How do you know?

694
00:57:41.962 --> 00:57:43.228
My mom sent me a text,

695
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:44.462
it's the last thing
I received from her

696
00:57:44.464 --> 00:57:46.031
before she went missing.

697
00:57:46.033 --> 00:57:50.035
And I know that's what
she was trying to tell me.

698
00:57:50.037 --> 00:57:52.037
And then you told the CIA?

699
00:57:52.039 --> 00:57:56.541
Well, I told Mister
Porter, but he laughed at me.

700
00:57:56.543 --> 00:57:59.511
He thinks I'm an immature gamer.

701
00:57:59.513 --> 00:58:02.783
Wonder where
he got that idea?

702
00:58:04.051 --> 00:58:04.885
Sorry.

703
00:58:06.253 --> 00:58:07.886
I might be on my own for this,

704
00:58:07.888 --> 00:58:12.824
but whether I am or not,
I'm gonna find my mother.

705
00:58:12.826 --> 00:58:13.894
Josh, Colt,

706
00:58:16.329 --> 00:58:17.629
this is insane.

707
00:58:17.631 --> 00:58:19.130
There's no way you
can outsmart the CIA

708
00:58:19.132 --> 00:58:20.801
and their resources.

709
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:45.692
When
I'm done tracking Colt,

710
00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:49.429
he won't give us the slip again.

711
00:58:51.832 --> 00:58:56.603
Just make sure that dog goes
with him wherever he goes.

712
00:59:02.008 --> 00:59:03.110
No problem.

713
00:59:06.847 --> 00:59:09.249
Just make it real.

714
00:59:30.238 --> 00:59:35.243
Bad things happen when
people don't follow the rules.

715
00:59:35.976 --> 00:59:37.377
Don't leave the house.

716
00:59:39.846 --> 00:59:41.615
Don't leave, or I'll-

717
00:59:42.482 --> 00:59:43.316
No!

718
00:59:45.652 --> 00:59:48.119
Look
what you just did.

719
00:59:48.121 --> 00:59:51.391
Now we're going to
need a new dog dish.

720
00:59:55.862 --> 00:59:57.162
Put
the weapon down, Colt.

721
00:59:57.164 --> 00:59:58.398
It's not a toy.

722
01:00:10.944 --> 01:00:13.547
Oh that's real nice.

723
01:00:20.554 --> 01:00:23.321
Make sure you take
care of that doggie.

724
01:00:23.323 --> 01:00:24.991
And don't shoot him.

725
01:00:48.582 --> 01:00:50.650
What's
Oreo doing here?

726
01:00:57.657 --> 01:00:59.924
This is what my mom was
texting special agent Whitmore

727
01:00:59.926 --> 01:01:01.593
when she was captured.

728
01:01:01.595 --> 01:01:05.496
I know it's a reference to
a video game that I play.

729
01:01:05.498 --> 01:01:07.398
I was trying to
tell the boss but,

730
01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.900
Whitmore's not taking
any of my calls,

731
01:01:08.902 --> 01:01:12.704
I keep leaving messages but
he's in siege mode right now.

732
01:01:12.706 --> 01:01:15.673
How are you gonna
get his attention?

733
01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:25.785
Here, you take Oreo.

734
01:01:36.563 --> 01:01:38.630
You sure
this is the place.

735
01:01:38.632 --> 01:01:40.098
Trust me, there's
nothing as awkward

736
01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.834
as going on a date with
your mom and her boyfriend.

737
01:01:42.836 --> 01:01:44.969
You don't forget it.

738
01:01:44.971 --> 01:01:47.639
Well, we can get into a lot
of trouble for doing this.

739
01:01:47.641 --> 01:01:50.808
You said we have
to get his attention.

740
01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:51.611
Come on.

741
01:02:13.066 --> 01:02:17.035
Put your hands
right where I can see them.

742
01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:19.771
This is gonna be pretty
hard to explain to my parents.

743
01:02:19.773 --> 01:02:21.942
How we're both smart like-

744
01:02:28.148 --> 01:02:29.647
Before you
do anything to us,

745
01:02:29.649 --> 01:02:32.251
you need to call Special
Agent Whitmore at the CIA,

746
01:02:32.253 --> 01:02:34.852
and tell him he's in
violation of Section 23,

747
01:02:34.854 --> 01:02:36.756
Article 8, Paragraph B.

748
01:02:39.793 --> 01:02:42.062
I've
never heard of that.

749
01:02:43.463 --> 01:02:46.631
I've
never heard of it, either.

750
01:02:46.633 --> 01:02:48.466
Well, call
Whitmore at the CIA,

751
01:02:48.468 --> 01:02:50.935
he'll know what
we're talking about.

752
01:02:50.937 --> 01:02:52.670
Agent Riely,

753
01:02:52.672 --> 01:02:54.038
we've got a couple
of teenagers outside

754
01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.507
Agent Whitmore's home.

755
01:02:56.509 --> 01:03:00.011
They say he's in some
violation of code.

756
01:03:00.013 --> 01:03:01.713
I assure
you we are doing everything

757
01:03:01.715 --> 01:03:03.215
in our power to find Lifestone.

758
01:03:03.217 --> 01:03:05.384
Sir, Collins
caught two kids at your house.

759
01:03:05.386 --> 01:03:07.018
The young man said
you are in violation

760
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:10.190
of Section 23, Article
8, Paragraph B.

761
01:03:11.558 --> 01:03:14.561
Does he have
a small dog with him?

762
01:03:15.662 --> 01:03:16.496
Yeah.

763
01:03:17.998 --> 01:03:19.630
Affirmative on the dog.

764
01:03:19.632 --> 01:03:21.469
I'll be right there.

765
01:03:22.702 --> 01:03:26.374
Excuse me sir, I've
gotta take care of this.

766
01:03:33.947 --> 01:03:37.617
That's how we found
out what "Stingr" meant.

767
01:03:38.785 --> 01:03:40.952
Did you tell
anybody else about this?

768
01:03:40.954 --> 01:03:45.156
Nope, yes I told
Agent Porter about it.

769
01:03:45.158 --> 01:03:49.996
That's strange, he's never
said anything to me about it.

770
01:03:51.432 --> 01:03:54.167
So, any updates
on finding Mom?

771
01:03:56.603 --> 01:03:58.838
No, nothing at this time.

772
01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.174
Colt, I want to
thank you for finding

773
01:04:03.176 --> 01:04:05.843
that tracking device on my car.

774
01:04:05.845 --> 01:04:07.479
Do you know, we had
six of our vehicles

775
01:04:07.481 --> 01:04:10.615
with that very
same device on it.

776
01:04:10.617 --> 01:04:13.220
It was a big break in the case.

777
01:04:14.388 --> 01:04:15.222
Thanks.

778
01:04:19.592 --> 01:04:21.692
I know that you
might not always

779
01:04:21.694 --> 01:04:25.096
answer these CIA questions but,

780
01:04:25.098 --> 01:04:28.367
now that I know my
mom is an agent,

781
01:04:28.369 --> 01:04:31.372
where was she when
she got captured?

782
01:04:34.808 --> 01:04:38.912
You know the address is
classified information.

783
01:04:52.959 --> 01:04:55.128
Don't get any crazy ideas.

784
01:05:03.736 --> 01:05:07.573
Colt, if you want to
contact me, here's my card.

785
01:05:07.575 --> 01:05:09.241
Alice, it was a
pleasure meeting you.

786
01:05:09.243 --> 01:05:11.109
Same to
you, Mister Whitmore.

787
01:05:11.111 --> 01:05:12.446
Take care now.

788
01:05:23.022 --> 01:05:25.491
Okay, so now we know
where the buy went down,

789
01:05:25.493 --> 01:05:28.429
we have to go see
it for ourselves.

790
01:05:32.399 --> 01:05:34.134
I'm sorry, I can't.

791
01:05:35.269 --> 01:05:38.537
I already have
plans for tonight.

792
01:05:38.539 --> 01:05:40.807
Maybe Jackson can take you?

793
01:07:38.992 --> 01:07:40.459
Jackson, there's
some things about me

794
01:07:40.461 --> 01:07:41.892
that you should know.

795
01:07:48.868 --> 01:07:52.937
I'm not Josh Morgan.

796
01:07:52.939 --> 01:07:54.473
My parents are CIA agents.

797
01:07:54.475 --> 01:07:57.743
My dad is dead and my mom
got captured, right here.

798
01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.351
That's why I asked
you to bring me here.

799
01:08:34.481 --> 01:08:36.415
So over here it's talking
about positive feedbacks,

800
01:08:36.417 --> 01:08:39.852
and negative feedbacks,
and what they do.

801
01:08:41.888 --> 01:08:43.120
What's up?

802
01:08:43.122 --> 01:08:46.023
Hey, Oreo
found this yesterday

803
01:08:46.025 --> 01:08:49.596
at the building where
my mom was kidnapped.

804
01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:52.798
What do you think it means.

805
01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.032
I looked into it, it
looks like it belongs

806
01:08:55.034 --> 01:08:59.237
to a flight school that's
about 35 miles from here.

807
01:08:59.239 --> 01:09:02.008
I have no way to
get there, but...

808
01:09:03.444 --> 01:09:07.146
So this isn't about me,
it's about a free ride.

809
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:10.183
When?

810
01:09:12.018 --> 01:09:14.085
Could we go now?

811
01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:30.134
Hey, have you guys bought
or sold any planes recently?

812
01:09:30.136 --> 01:09:32.371
We're
actually a flight school.

813
01:09:32.373 --> 01:09:33.904
I know, but the website
said that you guys

814
01:09:33.906 --> 01:09:36.040
buy and sell airplanes.

815
01:09:36.042 --> 01:09:38.310
Oh, well if you're looking
to buy or sell an airplane,

816
01:09:38.312 --> 01:09:40.245
you're gonna have
to talk to Marty.

817
01:09:40.247 --> 01:09:41.313
He does all of our sales.

818
01:09:41.315 --> 01:09:43.047
Okay, and where's Marty?

819
01:09:43.049 --> 01:09:45.118
Marty's not here today.

820
01:09:46.353 --> 01:09:49.454
Can I help you with
something else?

821
01:09:49.456 --> 01:09:52.491
No, I don't think
so, thank you.

822
01:09:52.493 --> 01:09:53.492
Colt!

823
01:09:53.494 --> 01:09:55.227
Look what I found.

824
01:09:55.229 --> 01:09:58.732
Isn't it just like the
one that you found?

825
01:10:00.701 --> 01:10:02.567
It's the same kind.

826
01:10:02.569 --> 01:10:04.838
They've been here for sure.

827
01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.676
I'm gonna make
sure the coast is clear.

828
01:10:10.544 --> 01:10:11.378
Come on.

829
01:10:14.013 --> 01:10:15.449
Come on, come on.

830
01:10:17.183 --> 01:10:20.652
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

831
01:10:20.654 --> 01:10:21.822
Okay, come on.

832
01:10:27.594 --> 01:10:29.661
I want to be an agent.

833
01:10:29.663 --> 01:10:31.061
Mister Porter, you're so cool,

834
01:10:31.063 --> 01:10:33.732
and I know you
could teach me how.

835
01:10:33.734 --> 01:10:36.934
It takes serious
dedication and hard work.

836
01:10:36.936 --> 01:10:38.904
You have to really

837
01:10:38.906 --> 01:10:40.874
care about your country.

838
01:10:43.911 --> 01:10:46.110
Well, I guess that
means I'll have to start

839
01:10:46.112 --> 01:10:48.248
working out with you then.

840
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:54.453
And, I guess that
means I'll start with

841
01:10:54.455 --> 01:10:57.257
letting some fresh
air in as well.

842
01:11:15.676 --> 01:11:18.946
Colt, you can't
just become an agent.

843
01:11:21.215 --> 01:11:22.883
Well, I could try.

844
01:11:27.754 --> 01:11:29.421
I mean, how many
years of working out

845
01:11:29.423 --> 01:11:31.592
does it take to get there?

846
01:11:33.861 --> 01:11:37.431
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty?

847
01:11:41.935 --> 01:11:45.339
So, how many reps on
this one can you do?

848
01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.708
I know exactly
what you're doing.

849
01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:50.511
You do?

850
01:11:56.082 --> 01:11:57.282
You're trying to
get on my good side,

851
01:11:57.284 --> 01:11:59.486
because you want something.

852
01:12:00.954 --> 01:12:02.456
Okay, you got me.

853
01:12:05.726 --> 01:12:07.494
It's almost cloned.

854
01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:11.030
So, what is it?

855
01:12:13.199 --> 01:12:17.203
Well, I was wondering
if you would be so kind,

856
01:12:19.439 --> 01:12:21.441
as to let me use the car

857
01:12:23.277 --> 01:12:25.111
so I could go to prom?

858
01:12:29.048 --> 01:12:32.049
You wouldn't make
a good agent, Colt.

859
01:12:32.051 --> 01:12:35.054
I was expecting
something much more.

860
01:12:36.924 --> 01:12:40.124
So that's a yes
on the car, then?

861
01:12:40.126 --> 01:12:43.328
We have the weapon,
and the plane.

862
01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:44.563
This is her phone.

863
01:12:44.565 --> 01:12:46.831
Enable tracking again.

864
01:12:46.833 --> 01:12:50.001
Give the CIA something
to keep them occupied.

865
01:12:50.003 --> 01:12:54.073
And we will still
have abandoned police building.

866
01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:12.292
Woops.

867
01:13:16.897 --> 01:13:18.899
There's always tomorrow.

868
01:13:34.047 --> 01:13:36.681
Okay, so
this is what we found.

869
01:13:36.683 --> 01:13:37.916
Missus Porter was
sending him texts

870
01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:39.217
the day the buy went down,

871
01:13:39.219 --> 01:13:40.952
but, since she's not an agent,

872
01:13:40.954 --> 01:13:43.223
what are these texts about?

873
01:13:52.099 --> 01:13:53.064
I'm here now.

874
01:13:53.066 --> 01:13:53.898
Missus Jones?

875
01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:54.833
Yes.

876
01:13:54.835 --> 01:13:55.836
Wait, hey?

877
01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.308
Special Agent Sheila
Porter with the CIA.

878
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:04.743
CIA?

879
01:14:04.745 --> 01:14:06.645
What's going on here?

880
01:14:06.647 --> 01:14:07.846
I'm here to talk to you

881
01:14:07.848 --> 01:14:09.514
about a young man by
the name of Josh Morgan,

882
01:14:09.516 --> 01:14:11.950
that your daughter is seeing?

883
01:14:11.952 --> 01:14:14.621
It's a very dangerous situation.

884
01:14:18.825 --> 01:14:20.494
The area is clear.

885
01:14:25.932 --> 01:14:27.199
We've got it.

886
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:31.469
We've got the phone.

887
01:14:31.471 --> 01:14:33.872
I'm uploading the data now.

888
01:14:33.874 --> 01:14:36.941
Good work, Agent Phariss.

889
01:14:43.817 --> 01:14:45.717
We
told you not to pursue.

890
01:14:45.719 --> 01:14:48.388
Or Agent Lifestone is history.

891
01:15:04.604 --> 01:15:06.707
Alice, we need to talk.

892
01:15:08.809 --> 01:15:10.942
Oh, did I forget your
sleeping pills again?

893
01:15:10.944 --> 01:15:13.947
No, it's not about
sleeping pills.

894
01:15:15.582 --> 01:15:18.418
Are you seeing
that new boy, Josh?

895
01:15:27.661 --> 01:15:29.027
How many millions?

896
01:15:29.029 --> 01:15:31.162
Lots
and lots on money.

897
01:15:31.164 --> 01:15:32.397
Millions.

898
01:15:36.002 --> 01:15:40.107
We are
going to have a blissful life.

899
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:44.843
I want to go everywhere.

900
01:15:44.845 --> 01:15:47.245
Anywhere and everywhere and,

901
01:15:47.247 --> 01:15:49.681
More than once, more than twice.

902
01:15:49.683 --> 01:15:52.517
Hey Alice,

903
01:15:52.519 --> 01:15:55.122
I know what we need to do next.

904
01:15:57.591 --> 01:16:00.925
I'm
sorry, I can't be involved.

905
01:16:00.927 --> 01:16:02.462
You're on your own.

906
01:16:12.939 --> 01:16:15.008
No
no, he's right here.

907
01:16:16.343 --> 01:16:17.177
Colt?

908
01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.015
This is for you.

909
01:16:24.584 --> 01:16:25.418
Hello?

910
01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:28.953
Colt,
this is Neil Glasswell,

911
01:16:28.955 --> 01:16:30.989
Director of the CIA.

912
01:16:30.991 --> 01:16:34.094
There's something
I need to tell you.

913
01:16:36.863 --> 01:16:41.101
We have reason to believe
that your mother is dead.

914
01:16:42.803 --> 01:16:43.870
I'm so sorry.

915
01:18:18.465 --> 01:18:19.799
Bro, you okay?

916
01:18:24.504 --> 01:18:29.175
I'm just trying to figure
out what to do with my life.

917
01:18:30.577 --> 01:18:31.411
Colt,

918
01:18:33.381 --> 01:18:35.882
relationships give us purpose.

919
01:18:37.285 --> 01:18:41.220
The greatest purpose comes from
the greatest relationships.

920
01:18:41.222 --> 01:18:45.892
And that's a relationship
with the God who loves you.

921
01:21:40.633 --> 01:21:43.136
Hey
Angel, how was the prom?

922
01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:48.975
It was awful.

923
01:21:50.777 --> 01:21:53.314
I went with the wrong guy, Dad.

924
01:21:54.248 --> 01:21:55.216
Come here.

925
01:21:56.649 --> 01:22:00.153
And Nicholas flirted
with Kelly all night long.

926
01:22:02.856 --> 01:22:05.692
You really like
Josh, don't you?

927
01:22:08.661 --> 01:22:11.565
But it's an
impossible situation.

928
01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:16.100
I'm sorry, but we
really need to work

929
01:22:16.102 --> 01:22:18.703
with Agent Porter on this.

930
01:22:18.705 --> 01:22:21.973
I don't think
we can trust him.

931
01:22:21.975 --> 01:22:23.244
You mean her?

932
01:22:24.878 --> 01:22:26.211
Sheila Porter?

933
01:22:26.213 --> 01:22:27.814
She's not an agent.

934
01:22:30.183 --> 01:22:31.017
Oh.

935
01:22:33.052 --> 01:22:35.853
They
want me on the bus.

936
01:22:35.855 --> 01:22:38.323
They
owe us that money.

937
01:22:38.325 --> 01:22:42.193
Put your
routing numbers in here.

938
01:22:44.831 --> 01:22:46.764
We'll take
care of the kid for a while.

939
01:22:46.766 --> 01:22:51.771
You'll feel remorse with what
happens, and then resign.

940
01:22:52.672 --> 01:22:53.905
It's almost better this way.

941
01:22:53.907 --> 01:22:55.440
It
changes everything. - If

942
01:22:55.442 --> 01:22:58.743
they catch the terrorists,
they'll find out about the money.

943
01:22:58.745 --> 01:22:59.944
How many millions?

944
01:22:59.946 --> 01:23:01.812
Millions, and millions.

945
01:23:01.814 --> 01:23:03.981
And millions.

946
01:23:03.983 --> 01:23:07.051
We are going to have
a blissful life.

947
01:23:07.053 --> 01:23:09.621
I want to go everywhere.

948
01:23:09.623 --> 01:23:11.155
Anywhere and everywhere.

949
01:23:11.157 --> 01:23:12.558
And more than once.

950
01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:13.793
More than twice.

951
01:23:24.438 --> 01:23:25.272
So?

952
01:23:26.873 --> 01:23:28.607
That mutt's
been in a lot of places,

953
01:23:28.609 --> 01:23:33.614
including Whitmore's house
and where the buy went down.

954
01:23:34.781 --> 01:23:36.584
It's time to get
rid of the kid.

955
01:23:43.424 --> 01:23:44.258
Josh?

956
01:23:46.527 --> 01:23:49.894
Colt, I have
to tell you something.

957
01:23:49.896 --> 01:23:51.697
I get it,
you're with Nicholas.

958
01:23:51.699 --> 01:23:53.632
You don't get anything.

959
01:23:53.634 --> 01:23:55.833
None of it matters now.

960
01:23:55.835 --> 01:23:57.003
Yes it does.

961
01:24:10.083 --> 01:24:12.618
What's going on here?

962
01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:14.419
So it appears Missus
Porter was directing him

963
01:24:14.421 --> 01:24:16.856
to get on the bus right here.

964
01:24:21.127 --> 01:24:22.827
What do you think
she was doing?

965
01:24:22.829 --> 01:24:24.363
I don't know, but
whatever it was,

966
01:24:24.365 --> 01:24:28.435
I don't think it has
anything to do with the CIA.

967
01:24:30.169 --> 01:24:31.836
I think we need
to call Whitmore.

968
01:24:31.838 --> 01:24:33.804
He needs to know about this.

969
01:24:33.806 --> 01:24:34.772
Can I use your phone?

970
01:24:34.774 --> 01:24:35.775
Okay, yep.

971
01:24:44.418 --> 01:24:47.151
Yeah, Agent Porter's
been with us a long time.

972
01:24:47.153 --> 01:24:49.321
Sheila Porter got him
onto that bus for a reason.

973
01:24:49.323 --> 01:24:51.456
It must have had something
to do with the buy.

974
01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:53.392
If they reprogrammed
the phone,

975
01:24:53.394 --> 01:24:54.992
that would explain
a lot of things.

976
01:24:54.994 --> 01:24:58.565
Something must have
happened on that bus.

977
01:25:00.367 --> 01:25:04.001
Be careful, this
doesn't sound right.

978
01:25:04.003 --> 01:25:07.205
Also, Mister Whitmore, while
I've got you on the line,

979
01:25:07.207 --> 01:25:08.540
I've been looking
into this airport,

980
01:25:08.542 --> 01:25:10.007
I think I have the
connection to the terrorists.

981
01:25:10.009 --> 01:25:11.710
If you want to bring
your spy team together

982
01:25:11.712 --> 01:25:12.977
I can brief them on what

983
01:25:12.979 --> 01:25:13.911
- I've already found.
- Conferencing with

984
01:25:13.913 --> 01:25:15.146
The Director.

985
01:25:15.148 --> 01:25:16.615
They
need you on the line.

986
01:25:16.617 --> 01:25:17.815
Okay, Colt I
gotta go, I got a meeting.

987
01:25:17.817 --> 01:25:19.050
Be careful there.

988
01:25:19.052 --> 01:25:19.984
But but, I.

989
01:25:25.693 --> 01:25:29.894
I think that airport has
something to do with this.

990
01:25:29.896 --> 01:25:34.668
The weapon is more effective
if it's released airborne.

991
01:25:35.769 --> 01:25:37.935
Doctor Walker, if I may,

992
01:25:37.937 --> 01:25:39.805
who was the most
valuable informant

993
01:25:39.807 --> 01:25:41.872
during your time of service?

994
01:25:41.874 --> 01:25:43.475
I'm afraid
the best agent to help you

995
01:25:43.477 --> 01:25:46.911
already gave his
life for his country.

996
01:25:46.913 --> 01:25:49.581
Charles Lifestone
died trying to stop

997
01:25:49.583 --> 01:25:52.016
these terrorist attacks.

998
01:25:52.018 --> 01:25:56.923
When you find that weapon, be
certain he is honored for it.

999
01:25:58.091 --> 01:26:00.860
Mister Secretary,
you have my word.

1000
01:26:05.632 --> 01:26:07.466
Hey, is Marty in today?

1001
01:26:07.468 --> 01:26:09.969
Yeah, he's right over there.

1002
01:26:14.575 --> 01:26:17.108
Excuse
me, are you Marty?

1003
01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:20.177
Has anyone bought
a plane recently?

1004
01:26:20.179 --> 01:26:22.913
Three guys just bought the
airplane in the blue hangar,

1005
01:26:22.915 --> 01:26:24.483
three days ago.

1006
01:26:24.485 --> 01:26:28.353
Come on,
let's go check it out.

1007
01:27:10.464 --> 01:27:11.563
Let's go around back.

1008
01:27:11.565 --> 01:27:12.399
Okay.

1009
01:27:32.084 --> 01:27:35.353
We'll fly
over the city tonight.

1010
01:27:35.355 --> 01:27:38.924
Rashid, he shall
watch the plane while we eat.

1011
01:27:38.926 --> 01:27:41.862
Rashid do
what Rashid want to do.

1012
01:27:44.431 --> 01:27:46.934
Watch the plane while you eat.

1013
01:27:51.572 --> 01:27:53.238
We've
gotta call Whitmore.

1014
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.172
Well, the GPS used
up all the battery on my cell.

1015
01:27:55.174 --> 01:27:56.374
Well now's our best chance,
we've got to do something,

1016
01:27:56.376 --> 01:27:58.110
they have the weapon.

1017
01:28:00.581 --> 01:28:04.585
Hey, I picked up my
mom's sleeping pills today.

1018
01:28:10.022 --> 01:28:12.357
Just try to get out
before he gets back, okay?

1019
01:28:12.359 --> 01:28:13.192
Okay.

1020
01:28:32.646 --> 01:28:34.080
Oreo, go fetch.

1021
01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:41.955
Hey, hey!

1022
01:28:44.358 --> 01:28:45.891
What are you doing here?

1023
01:28:45.893 --> 01:28:47.124
You stay away!

1024
01:28:47.126 --> 01:28:47.993
Stay away!

1025
01:28:47.995 --> 01:28:48.862
Go! Go!

1026
01:29:00.941 --> 01:29:03.808
I can't
believe it, we did it.

1027
01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:04.643
Okay okay okay.

1028
01:29:04.645 --> 01:29:06.578
Just take a drink.

1029
01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:10.549
Oh come on,
just take a drink.

1030
01:29:11.985 --> 01:29:12.817
Yes!

1031
01:29:12.819 --> 01:29:14.286
Yes.

1032
01:29:14.288 --> 01:29:16.655
Okay, now how long before
your mom falls asleep?

1033
01:29:16.657 --> 01:29:20.727
Well she usually takes
one, so I gave him four.

1034
01:29:40.013 --> 01:29:40.948
Let's go.

1035
01:29:46.053 --> 01:29:47.321
Here, take him.

1036
01:29:52.693 --> 01:29:53.825
Colt,
what are you doing?

1037
01:29:53.827 --> 01:29:55.293
He could wake up.

1038
01:29:55.295 --> 01:29:58.763
If he has a phone, I might
be able to find my mom.

1039
01:29:58.765 --> 01:30:00.799
Okay, will you just hurry?

1040
01:30:00.801 --> 01:30:03.403
This could be my only chance.

1041
01:30:11.244 --> 01:30:13.413
I got it, but it's locked.

1042
01:30:15.849 --> 01:30:17.684
Try his fingerprint.

1043
01:30:37.504 --> 01:30:39.171
Okay, I've got it.

1044
01:30:51.018 --> 01:30:52.617
Rashid!

1045
01:30:52.619 --> 01:30:53.685
Rashid!

1046
01:30:53.687 --> 01:30:54.988
They killed him!

1047
01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.800
Okay,
we've gotta leave.

1048
01:31:08.802 --> 01:31:10.235
What, you don't
have a driver's license,

1049
01:31:10.237 --> 01:31:11.936
but you can fly a plane?

1050
01:31:11.938 --> 01:31:12.871
Okay, I might have exaggerated

1051
01:31:12.873 --> 01:31:13.938
about my grades a little bit,

1052
01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.407
but I really do know how to fly.

1053
01:31:15.409 --> 01:31:16.574
But.

1054
01:31:16.576 --> 01:31:17.709
Yeah.

1055
01:31:17.711 --> 01:31:19.546
Here, get in, come on.

1056
01:31:35.228 --> 01:31:38.463
Don't shoot, don't
shoot, or we lose the weapon.

1057
01:31:38.465 --> 01:31:40.532
They're stealing our plane.

1058
01:31:47.007 --> 01:31:51.443
Cessna 7-3-9 Hotel X-ray
is being stolen, by children.

1059
01:31:51.445 --> 01:31:53.912
They're not
even real pilots.

1060
01:31:53.914 --> 01:31:55.647
Hang on,
we're going for a ride.

1061
01:31:55.649 --> 01:31:57.148
Go go go, now!

1062
01:31:57.150 --> 01:31:58.183
Okay, check his phone,

1063
01:31:58.185 --> 01:31:59.684
look for any selfies

1064
01:31:59.686 --> 01:32:01.119
and then text those to
Whitmore if you find any.

1065
01:32:01.121 --> 01:32:02.287
What do I tell him?

1066
01:32:02.289 --> 01:32:04.422
Tell him
these are the bad guys.

1067
01:32:04.424 --> 01:32:06.157
Cessna 7-3-9 Hotel X-ray

1068
01:32:06.159 --> 01:32:07.692
you are not cleared for takeoff.

1069
01:32:07.694 --> 01:32:10.095
Repeat, do not take off.

1070
01:32:10.097 --> 01:32:12.230
The CIA will
be calling any minute.

1071
01:32:12.232 --> 01:32:14.165
Tell them I have the canister,

1072
01:32:14.167 --> 01:32:15.667
and I'm headed for Langley.

1073
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:17.268
Cessna 7-3-9 Hotel X-ray

1074
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:20.206
you are in violation
of FAA regulations.

1075
01:32:20.208 --> 01:32:21.639
Your license will be suspended,

1076
01:32:21.641 --> 01:32:24.811
and you will be
arrested upon landing.

1077
01:32:52.105 --> 01:32:53.373
What's wrong?

1078
01:32:56.009 --> 01:32:57.809
The account's frozen.

1079
01:32:57.811 --> 01:33:00.714
You sure it's
not the connection?

1080
01:33:06.887 --> 01:33:10.388
They patched into the account.

1081
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:11.225
They know.

1082
01:33:18.266 --> 01:33:19.099
I knew it!

1083
01:33:20.367 --> 01:33:21.201
That Colt!

1084
01:33:24.171 --> 01:33:26.506
Everybody okay down there?

1085
01:33:39.152 --> 01:33:40.518
They're flying north.

1086
01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:41.753
In 20 minutes they'll be

1087
01:33:41.755 --> 01:33:44.522
close enough to the
city to detonate.

1088
01:33:44.524 --> 01:33:47.358
Director
Glasswell, she's alive!

1089
01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.094
We'll have a medical
update shortly.

1090
01:33:50.096 --> 01:33:53.698
All right, keep me updated
with any new developments.

1091
01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:55.802
I love
swash and buckle!

1092
01:33:56.937 --> 01:33:58.171
Give me that.

1093
01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:12.152
It's swashbuckle.

1094
01:34:18.792 --> 01:34:21.559
She's
weak but she's responsive.

1095
01:34:21.561 --> 01:34:22.395
Okay.

1096
01:34:27.734 --> 01:34:30.201
How did you find me?

1097
01:34:30.203 --> 01:34:32.304
Colt found you.

1098
01:34:32.306 --> 01:34:33.640
Colt? My Colt?

1099
01:34:35.408 --> 01:34:36.676
Yeah.

1100
01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:41.946
The medical
team will be here soon.

1101
01:34:41.948 --> 01:34:43.548
She's gonna make it.

1102
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:44.551
Thank God.

1103
01:35:02.736 --> 01:35:03.935
I didn't
think he was serious.

1104
01:35:03.937 --> 01:35:06.272
There's no way we
can outmaneuver them.

1105
01:35:06.274 --> 01:35:10.278
Let's hope Whitmore gets
through to them in time!

1106
01:35:11.878 --> 01:35:12.710
Colt Lifestone,

1107
01:35:12.712 --> 01:35:14.412
this is Colonel Ramsey.

1108
01:35:14.414 --> 01:35:15.914
I'm a friend of your father's.

1109
01:35:15.916 --> 01:35:18.919
We're here to escort
you to Langley.

1110
01:35:20.086 --> 01:35:21.953
Thank you, sir.

1111
01:35:21.955 --> 01:35:23.755
Do you
have the bio weapon onboard?

1112
01:35:23.757 --> 01:35:24.858
Yes, we do.

1113
01:35:26.092 --> 01:35:27.792
Are
the glass tubes green?

1114
01:35:27.794 --> 01:35:29.328
That's affirmative.

1115
01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:31.529
Good, they can't
control it from the ground.

1116
01:35:31.531 --> 01:35:33.698
You should be okay.

1117
01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:34.799
Detonate it now!

1118
01:35:34.801 --> 01:35:36.268
Wait.

1119
01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:37.771
He needs to be closer.

1120
01:35:43.443 --> 01:35:44.844
Colt, it's red.

1121
01:35:46.513 --> 01:35:48.479
Here, you've
gotta fly for a minute.

1122
01:35:48.481 --> 01:35:49.847
What are you doing?

1123
01:35:49.849 --> 01:35:50.782
There's a cell
phone detonator,

1124
01:35:50.784 --> 01:35:52.953
I've gotta deal with this.

1125
01:35:58.225 --> 01:36:01.194
What's going on in there?

1126
01:36:02.762 --> 01:36:03.697
It's red.

1127
01:36:05.065 --> 01:36:08.134
Tell
Colt not to touch it.

1128
01:36:10.237 --> 01:36:11.238
Do it now!

1129
01:36:37.497 --> 01:36:38.696
My friend is dying,

1130
01:36:38.698 --> 01:36:40.164
I must have plane to
airlift him immediately.

1131
01:36:40.166 --> 01:36:41.400
Okay,
let me call an ambulance.

1132
01:36:41.402 --> 01:36:42.734
I really think that's
gonna be your best bet.

1133
01:36:42.736 --> 01:36:43.903
He is dying!

1134
01:36:46.474 --> 01:36:50.708
Sir, a gun like that is
against our security policy!

1135
01:36:50.710 --> 01:36:52.211
Okay, you
two create a distraction.

1136
01:36:52.213 --> 01:36:56.384
I'll go around and come
in from the ramp entrance.

1137
01:36:57.851 --> 01:37:00.084
Give me the keys
to that Cessna 310 there.

1138
01:37:00.086 --> 01:37:01.019
Okay, you know what?

1139
01:37:01.021 --> 01:37:02.388
You're gonna need to calm down.

1140
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:03.322
Is that thing real?

1141
01:37:03.324 --> 01:37:05.089
Okay, I cannot rent it to you

1142
01:37:05.091 --> 01:37:09.829
until you get some flight
training experience with Marty.

1143
01:37:11.064 --> 01:37:13.731
Hey!

1144
01:37:24.544 --> 01:37:26.280
CIA, you're arrest.

1145
01:37:28.048 --> 01:37:29.314
Put your weapon down,

1146
01:37:29.316 --> 01:37:32.185
put your hands on
top of your head.

1147
01:37:54.308 --> 01:37:57.944
What is
that noise, what is that?

1148
01:38:02.682 --> 01:38:04.518
How well can you swim?

1149
01:38:38.852 --> 01:38:39.817
Slowly
exit the aircraft,

1150
01:38:39.819 --> 01:38:41.085
keep your hands in the air,

1151
01:38:41.087 --> 01:38:43.723
and don't make any
sudden movements.

1152
01:38:48.596 --> 01:38:50.462
My name is Colt Lifestone,

1153
01:38:50.464 --> 01:38:53.300
I have a dangerous
weapon onboard.

1154
01:38:57.704 --> 01:39:00.707
Welcome
to Langley Air Force Base.

1155
01:39:14.888 --> 01:39:17.922
Director Glasswell,
we have the bomb.

1156
01:39:17.924 --> 01:39:19.527
It's a Yakov22.

1157
01:39:27.301 --> 01:39:29.303
Secure
it for transport.

1158
01:39:38.412 --> 01:39:39.611
I need your palm,

1159
01:39:39.613 --> 01:39:41.712
I'm checking for
contamination, sir.

1160
01:39:41.714 --> 01:39:42.780
You're cleared.

1161
01:39:42.782 --> 01:39:44.784
Ma'am, I need your palm.

1162
01:39:47.454 --> 01:39:48.355
Mom? Mom!

1163
01:39:57.163 --> 01:39:59.165
I'm so glad you're okay.

1164
01:40:15.014 --> 01:40:17.915
There's someone I
want you to meet.

1165
01:40:17.917 --> 01:40:20.718
Mister Whitmore was
telling me about her.

1166
01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:22.389
Her name is Alice.

1167
01:40:23.557 --> 01:40:27.228
By the way Mom, what's
your real name anyways?

1168
01:40:28.928 --> 01:40:30.562
So class, I'd
like to close this section

1169
01:40:30.564 --> 01:40:32.065
by reading a poem.

1170
01:40:36.069 --> 01:40:38.337
"Heroes use their
talents every day,

1171
01:40:38.339 --> 01:40:41.373
and people seldom
know their name.

1172
01:40:41.375 --> 01:40:44.443
It's difficult work
with simple pay.

1173
01:40:44.445 --> 01:40:46.978
It rarely leads to fame.

1174
01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:50.147
When trials come, it
makes them strong,

1175
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:52.850
and they fight on
in trouble's face,

1176
01:40:52.852 --> 01:40:55.354
where work is hard
and days are long,

1177
01:40:55.356 --> 01:40:58.091
to make the world
a better place.

1178
01:40:59.293 --> 01:41:02.227
Here this call from
a faithful voice,

1179
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:04.895
yet even in the darkest night,

1180
01:41:04.897 --> 01:41:07.699
we can all be heroes
with a choice,

1181
01:41:07.701 --> 01:41:10.638
when we choose to
do what's right."

1182
01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:44.835
Yeah, about that.

1183
01:41:44.837 --> 01:41:46.438
Sorry I never got back with you.

1184
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.839
What's going on man?

1185
01:41:48.841 --> 01:41:50.043
Where you been?

1186
01:41:51.278 --> 01:41:54.145
Okay Landon, I can
explain everything.

1187
01:41:54.147 --> 01:41:56.047
You just gotta realize

1188
01:41:56.049 --> 01:41:58.084
some things have changed.

1189
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:05.457
All right well,

1190
01:42:05.459 --> 01:42:07.191
whenever you get back
from your journey,

1191
01:42:07.193 --> 01:42:08.194
or vacation.

1192
01:42:09.862 --> 01:42:11.563
Whatever you're on.

1193
01:42:11.565 --> 01:42:14.568
Guess we got some
catchin' up to do.

1194
01:42:19.273 --> 01:42:24.141
I was hoping for
a second change at prom.

1195
01:42:48.402 --> 01:42:49.634
What now?

1196
01:42:49.636 --> 01:42:52.339
Does everything
go back to normal?

1197
01:43:00.179 --> 01:43:03.715
I'm always gonna
be the Colt Lifestone

1198
01:43:03.717 --> 01:43:05.486
that cares about you.

1199
01:43:06.487 --> 01:43:07.321
I promise.

1200
01:43:31.779 --> 01:43:32.977
I worked
out a small reward

1201
01:43:32.979 --> 01:43:35.649
for your service to our country.

1202
01:43:36.817 --> 01:43:39.584
You get 30 minutes, or
a full tank of fuel.

1203
01:43:39.586 --> 01:43:42.856
Colonel Armstrong
will be your copilot.

1204
01:43:48.161 --> 01:43:51.498
Come on Skydog, let's fly!

1205
01:44:31.401 --> 01:44:36.401
