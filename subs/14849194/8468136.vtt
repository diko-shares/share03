Paul, at your core,
you're an excellent teacher,

171

183
00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:49.640
as long as Daddy builds a new gymnasium?

184
00:10:49.723 --> 00:10:51.774
Of course not. That's not who we are.

185
00:10:51.857 --> 00:10:54.139
But we can't be ignorant to politics.

186
00:10:54.222 --> 00:10:57.010
That boy is too dumb
to pour piss out of a boot.

187
00:10:57.093 --> 00:10:59.078
A genuine troglodyte.

188
00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:01.146
Jesus Christ, Paul.

189
00:11:01.229 --> 00:11:03.918
He was a legacy and the son
of one of our biggest donors.

190
00:11:04.001 --> 00:11:05.755
Ever think his dad might be expecting

191
00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:07.757
a little consideration for his dollar?

192
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.288
And he got it... a first-class
education for his son.

193
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:12.993
Oh, come on, Hardy.

194
00:11:13.076 --> 00:11:17.195
As Dr. Greene used to say,
"Our one true purpose

195
00:11:17.278 --> 00:11:19.296
is to produce young men
of good character."

196
00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:21.430
I don't care what Dr. Greene used to say.

197
00:11:21.513 --> 00:11:23.267
"And we cannot sacrifice our integrity

198
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.170
on the altar of their entitlement."

199
00:11:25.253 --> 00:11:29.207
I'm just trying to instill
basic academic discipline.

200
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.715
That's my job. Isn't it yours?

201
00:11:31.798 --> 00:11:33.475
It was.

202
00:11:33.558 --> 00:11:35.510
Until I became headmaster

203
00:11:35.593 --> 00:11:38.546
and saw that it's not so simple
to keep the damn school afloat.

204
00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:42.825
I begged you, begged you
to give the kid a C minus.

205
00:11:42.908 --> 00:11:44.288
(chuckles): No.

206
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:45.861
There are instructors here
who will do that.

207
00:11:45.944 --> 00:11:48.012
I am not one of them.

208
00:11:52.315 --> 00:11:55.662
Here's the manual and a full set of keys.

209
00:11:55.745 --> 00:11:57.807
Everything you need to know is in there.

210
00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.974
Your only task is to ensure

211
00:12:00.057 --> 00:12:02.471
the boys' absolute safety
and good condition.

212
00:12:02.554 --> 00:12:06.882
And at least pretend to be a human being.

213
00:12:06.965 --> 00:12:08.818
Please.

214
00:12:08.901 --> 00:12:10.853
It's Christmas.

Where the hell is Walleye?

219
00:12:19.637 --> 00:12:22.112
He's probably jerking off
in the Cobb salad.

220
00:12:23.214 --> 00:12:25.197
-Why would he do that?
-Because he's Walleye.

Who knows what
that foul-smelling freak does?

222
00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:29.564
But you went straight to the Cobb salad.

223
00:12:29.647 --> 00:12:31.775
I mean, do you know something?

224
00:12:31.858 --> 00:12:33.909

Hmm.

231
00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:15.610
I can tell by your faces that many of you

232
00:13:15.693 --> 00:13:18.085
are shocked at the outcome.

233
00:13:18.168 --> 00:13:20.923
I, on the other hand, am not,
because I have had

234
00:13:21.006 --> 00:13:23.618
the misfortune
of teaching you this semester.

235
00:13:23.701 --> 00:13:26.588
And even with my ocular limitations,

236
00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:28.623
I witnessed firsthand

237
00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:32.132
your glazed, uncomprehending expressions.

238
00:13:32.215 --> 00:13:34.299
Sir, I don't understand.

239
00:13:34.382 --> 00:13:36.235
That's glaringly apparent.

240
00:13:36.318 --> 00:13:39.436
No, it's... (sighs) I
can't fail this class.

241
00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:41.570
Oh, don't sell yourself short,
Mr. Kountze.

242
00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:43.572
I truly believe that you can.

243
00:13:43.655 --> 00:13:45.607
I'm supposed to go to Cornell.

244
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.642
Unlikely.

245
00:13:47.725 --> 00:13:50.249
Please, sir. My dad's going to flip out.

00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:57.355
All right. All right.

248
00:13:57.438 --> 00:13:59.588
Uh, in the spirit of the season,

249
00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:01.359
I suppose the most constructive way

250
00:14:01.442 --> 00:14:03.295
of dealing with your shortcomings

251
00:14:03.378 --> 00:14:06.936
is to offer a makeup exam.

252
00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:09.532
You'll all get a second run
at this after break.

253
00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:13.041
(students sighing, murmuring)

254
00:14:13.124 --> 00:14:15.846
Of course, it will not be the same exam.

255
00:14:15.929 --> 00:14:18.046
You will now be responsible
for new material as well.

256
00:14:18.129 --> 00:14:19.773
(students groaning, murmuring)

257
00:14:19.856 --> 00:14:21.775
Your grade will be an average of the two.

258
00:14:21.858 --> 00:14:24.217
Please open your books to chapter six.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.859
You've already met Pericles.

261
00:14:28.942 --> 00:14:31.488
Now prepare yourselves
to meet Demosthenes.

262
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:34.227
No offense, sir, but is this really

263
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.493
the best time to be starting
a new chapter?

264
00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:41.201
I mean, we all appreciate the,
uh, makeup exam gesture,

265
00:14:41.284 --> 00:14:44.138
but our families are here.

266
00:14:44.221 --> 00:14:46.305
You know, most teachers
have already canceled class.

267
00:14:46.388 --> 00:14:48.637
We have chapel in 40 minutes,
then we're out of here.

268
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.343
-Mm.
-I mean, our heads are elsewhere.

269
00:14:51.426 --> 00:14:54.841
And where exactly is your head, Mr. Tully?

270
00:14:54.924 --> 00:14:56.546
Um, I don't know.

00:14:59.137 --> 00:15:00.418
Yes, indeed.

274
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:02.503
I see you've brought your valise.

275
00:15:03.506 --> 00:15:05.225
Spot-on, sir.

276
00:15:05.308 --> 00:15:07.898
It's just that it's been
a really exhausting semester.

277
00:15:07.981 --> 00:15:11.594
Getting into new material now
right before break?

278
00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:14.399
Honestly, it's a little absurd.

279
00:15:14.482 --> 00:15:15.813
Sir.

280
00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:21.945
Well, I would hate to be absurd.

281
00:15:22.028 --> 00:15:25.344
So let's just scuttle
the whole thing, shall we,

282
00:15:25.427 --> 00:15:27.610

284
00:15:30.135 --> 00:15:31.614
Uh, excuse me, sir.

285
00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:34.584
I think, uh, we all liked
the first option better.

286
00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.685
What'd you say the guy's
name was? Uh, Demosthe-who?

287
00:15:36.768 --> 00:15:39.127
Of course, I still expect you
to be familiar with chapter six

288
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.295
upon your return,
so pack those textbooks, boys.

289
00:15:42.378 --> 00:15:44.297
And if displeased,

290
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.482
take it up with your
champion... Mr. Tully.

291
00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:50.056

less fortunate than we.

Let us remember the poor and the helpless,

308
00:16:55.044 --> 00:16:58.124
the cold, the hungry and the oppressed.

309
00:16:59.259 --> 00:17:01.605

Nice work, anus.

312
00:17:05.131 --> 00:17:06.940
Can you not talk, please?
I'm trying to pray.

313
00:17:07.023 --> 00:17:08.942
You better pray I don't catch you alone,

314
00:17:09.025 --> 00:17:11.648
because I will full-on nut-punch you.

315
00:17:11.731 --> 00:17:13.221

Sorry to hear about your mother, Endicott.

319
00:17:20.311 --> 00:17:21.658
What?

320
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:23.726
Oh. Yes.

321
00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:25.134
Thank you.

322
00:17:25.217 --> 00:17:27.202
Yeah. We're all pulling for her.

324
00:17:28.979 --> 00:17:32.900
And finally, let us pray
for the soul of Curtis Lamb,

Barton class of 1969.

326
00:17:35.656 --> 00:17:38.543

Curtis gave his life valiantly

327
00:17:38.626 --> 00:17:40.743
in the service of his country.

328
00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:44.186
And let us once again extend
our deepest condolences

329

to one of the most cherished
members of the Barton family,

330
00:17:47.096 --> 00:17:48.801
his mother Mary.

331
00:17:49.804 --> 00:17:52.018
Mary, we remember Curtis

332
00:17:52.101 --> 00:17:54.592
as such an outstanding
and promising young man,

333
00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:57.199
and we know this holiday season

334
00:17:57.282 --> 00:18:00.169
will be especially difficult without him.

335
00:18:00.252 --> 00:18:04.355
Please know that we
accompany you in your grief.

336
00:18:05.886 --> 00:18:08.177
May the all-powerful God
who protected Abraham

337
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.005
when he left his native land
protect all our brave soldiers

338
00:18:12.088 --> 00:18:15.283
until they are delivered
safely home to us.

339
00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:17.945
We ask this through Christ our Lord.

340
00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:19.386
Amen.

DR. WOODRUP: Congressman,
Merry Christmas to you.

I know it's last minute, and I am...

359
00:19:16.394 --> 00:19:18.313
I'm absolutely heartbroken,

360
00:19:18.396 --> 00:19:20.073
but could you please see your way

361
00:19:20.156 --> 00:19:23.010
to staying at school over break
just this once?

362
00:19:23.093 --> 00:19:25.012
Stanley has been working so hard,

363
00:19:25.095 --> 00:19:27.190
and-and we've had no time for a honeymoon.

364
00:19:27.273 --> 00:19:29.423
You guys have been married since July.

365
00:19:29.506 --> 00:19:30.853
You've had all these months.

366
00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:32.657
Something's always come up.

367
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.593
I know it's a lot to ask,

368
00:19:34.676 --> 00:19:37.167
but you know how lonely I've been.

369
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.861
I've been lonely too.

370
00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.764
And what about Boston?

371
00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:43.833
You promised on the way
we'd spend some time in Boston.

372
00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:46.000
Angus, listen to me.

373
00:19:46.083 --> 00:19:48.211
This is our new family, okay?

374
00:19:48.294 --> 00:19:50.642
I know you miss your
father... I do, too...

375
00:19:50.725 --> 00:19:53.040
but there's someone new in my life.

376
00:19:53.123 --> 00:19:55.317
It's just this once, darling.

377
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.945
We'll be together at spring break,

378
00:19:57.028 --> 00:19:58.353
and we'll have the whole summer.

379
00:19:58.436 --> 00:20:00.113
Fuck the summer, and fuck Stanley.

380
00:20:00.196 --> 00:20:01.950
Angus.

381
00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:03.556
Are you kidding me?

382
00:20:03.639 --> 00:20:05.327
I'm just supposed to stay here?

383
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.724
(Judy sighs)

384
00:20:06.807 --> 00:20:09.958
Mom, please don't do this.

385
00:20:10.041 --> 00:20:12.026
Please.

386
00:20:12.109 --> 00:20:14.028
PAUL: <i>I suspect that, like me,</i>

387
00:20:14.111 --> 00:20:16.536
this is not how you wanted
to spend your holidays,

388
00:20:16.619 --> 00:20:19.132
but such are the vicissitudes of life.

389
00:20:19.215 --> 00:20:21.211
And as Barton men,

390
00:20:21.294 --> 00:20:23.510
we learn to confront our challenges

391
00:20:23.593 --> 00:20:25.842
with heads held high and with a spirit

392
00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:27.745
of courage and good fellowship.

393
00:20:27.828 --> 00:20:29.681
Uh, in strict accordance with the dictates

394
00:20:29.764 --> 00:20:32.371
of the manual, of course.

395
00:20:34.606 --> 00:20:37.755
Mr. Tully, are you joining us as well?

396
00:20:37.838 --> 00:20:39.774
What happened to St. Kitts?

397
00:20:41.008 --> 00:20:43.316
Something came up.

398
00:20:47.553 --> 00:20:49.487
(suitcase thuds loudly on floor)

399
00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:52.506
(Paul clears throat)

400
00:20:52.589 --> 00:20:54.442
So, for the next two weeks,

401
00:20:54.525 --> 00:20:57.071
we will be following
a standard school schedule...

402
00:20:57.154 --> 00:20:59.381
Sir? Uh, sir, we're on vacation.

403
00:20:59.464 --> 00:21:01.614
...which means we will be
taking our meals together,

404
00:21:01.697 --> 00:21:04.012
and you will observe
regular hours of study.

405
00:21:04.095 --> 00:21:06.685
Study? Are you kidding me?

406
00:21:06.768 --> 00:21:08.522
The Peloponnesian War awaits, Mr. Kountze.

407
00:21:08.605 --> 00:21:10.216
You and Mr. Tully.

408
00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:12.361
The rest of you can get a jump
on the next semester.

409
00:21:12.444 --> 00:21:14.561
It'll pay off. You'll see.

410
00:21:14.644 --> 00:21:15.892
We're already holding over,

411
00:21:15.975 --> 00:21:17.531
and now we're being punished for it?

412
00:21:17.614 --> 00:21:19.929
You will be afforded
limited windows for recreation

413
00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:22.129
and supervised physical activity.

414
00:21:22.212 --> 00:21:24.131
The gym's not even open yet.

415
00:21:24.214 --> 00:21:25.902
Yeah, they've only lacquered
half the floor.

416
00:21:25.985 --> 00:21:27.475
PAUL: Fresh air will do you good.

417
00:21:27.558 --> 00:21:29.939
It's like 15 degrees outside.

418
00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:33.239
And the Romans bathed naked
in the freezing Tiber.

419
00:21:33.322 --> 00:21:35.978
Adversity builds character, Mr. Tully.

420
00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:38.453
Uh, speaking of which,
the school will be cutting heat

421
00:21:38.536 --> 00:21:40.290
to dormitories and faculty housing,

422
00:21:40.373 --> 00:21:42.556
so we'll all be bunking in the infirmary.

423
00:21:42.639 --> 00:21:44.789
(sighing): Oh, God. Geez.

424
00:21:44.872 --> 00:21:46.890
("Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht
(Silent Night)" playing)

425
00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:49.222
ANGUS: This is the most bullshit ever.

426
00:21:49.305 --> 00:21:51.334
If we have to stay,
why'd we have to draw Walleye?

427
00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:53.336
JASON: Uh, you know
he used to be a student, right?

428
00:21:53.419 --> 00:21:54.997
Yeah, that's why he knows how to inflict

429
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.065
maximum pain on us, the sadistic fuck.

430
00:21:57.148 --> 00:21:58.803
TEDDY: At least we didn't draw Decker.

431
00:21:58.886 --> 00:22:01.740
He'd be perving all over us.

432
00:22:01.823 --> 00:22:04.089
ANGUS: Hey, guys, hold up for a second.

433
00:22:06.126 --> 00:22:07.746
Want one?

434
00:22:07.829 --> 00:22:09.897
TEDDY: No. I got something else.

435
00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:13.917
Give me that.

436
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.424
Hey, don't smoke that out here.

437
00:22:15.507 --> 00:22:17.019
I don't want to get busted by Walleye.

438
00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:18.592
TEDDY: Don't be such a pussy.

439
00:22:18.675 --> 00:22:20.088
ANGUS: I'm not a pussy. I just don't want

440
00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:22.778
to end up at Fork Union
paying for your mistake.

441
00:22:24.144 --> 00:22:25.533
Teddy Kountze.

442
00:22:25.616 --> 00:22:26.765
Jason Smith.

443
00:22:26.848 --> 00:22:28.668
Yeah, I know who you are.

444
00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:30.637
Want to hit this?

445
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.590
Uh, yeah.

446
00:22:35.419 --> 00:22:37.303
You got a great arm, man.

447
00:22:37.386 --> 00:22:38.843
Yeah, well, it's just football.

448
00:22:38.926 --> 00:22:40.614
So, how'd you get stuck holding over?

449
00:22:40.697 --> 00:22:42.649
I'm supposed to be skiing
with my folks up at Haystack,

450
00:22:42.732 --> 00:22:44.178
but my dad put his foot down,

451
00:22:44.261 --> 00:22:45.949
said I can't come home
unless I cut my hair.

452
00:22:46.032 --> 00:22:47.984
(scoffs) So why don't you
just cut your hair?

453
00:22:48.067 --> 00:22:49.656
Civil disobedience, man.

454
00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:51.394
ANGUS: Yeah, right.

455
00:22:51.477 --> 00:22:53.528
JASON: No, he's cool.
It's just a battle of wills.

456
00:22:53.611 --> 00:22:55.563
Still, I was kind of
hoping he'd cave first,

457
00:22:55.646 --> 00:22:58.396
because the powder up at
Haystack is so sweet right now.

458
00:22:59.652 --> 00:23:01.866
What about you, Mr. Moto?

459
00:23:01.949 --> 00:23:03.131
Why are you here?

460
00:23:03.214 --> 00:23:05.034
Uh, no. Uh, my name is Ye-Joon.

461
00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:06.970
Uh, my family is in Korea,

462
00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:09.742
and they think it's too far
for me to travel alone.

463
00:23:09.825 --> 00:23:12.976
I figured it was because your
rickshaw was broken. (laughs)

464
00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:15.550
Uh, what-what's a rickshaw?

465
00:23:15.633 --> 00:23:17.178
-You're an asshole, Kountze.
-(sighs)

466
00:23:17.261 --> 00:23:19.048
Your mind's a cesspool
and a shallow one at that.

467
00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:20.885
Who's the asshole, Tully?

468
00:23:20.968 --> 00:23:22.689
You're the one who blew up history.

469
00:23:22.772 --> 00:23:24.086
Hey.

470
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:25.527
What's your story, man?

471
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.353
Alex Ollerman.

472
00:23:27.436 --> 00:23:30.026
I'm here because my parents
are on a mission in Paraguay.

473
00:23:30.109 --> 00:23:31.698
We're LDS.

474
00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:33.568
JASON: Mormons, right?

475
00:23:33.651 --> 00:23:36.362
Don't you guys wear some kind
of like magic underwear?

476
00:23:36.445 --> 00:23:38.001
ALEX: That's a common misconception.

477
00:23:38.084 --> 00:23:39.673
Actually, it's called a temple garment,

478
00:23:39.756 --> 00:23:41.510
and we're only supposed
to wear it when we...

479
00:23:41.593 --> 00:23:43.270
Hey, what's up with the townies?

480
00:23:43.353 --> 00:23:45.679
Hey, what are you doing
with our Christmas tree?

481
00:23:45.762 --> 00:23:48.044
The school sold it back to us.

482
00:23:48.127 --> 00:23:50.178
Scotch pine, still fresh.

483
00:23:50.261 --> 00:23:52.048
MAN 2: Yeah, we're going to
put it back on the lot.

484
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:53.379
We do it every year.

485
00:23:53.462 --> 00:23:55.332
This is the most bullshit ever.

486
00:24:00.911 --> 00:24:02.531
Hello, Mary. (sighs)

487
00:24:02.614 --> 00:24:04.258
Mr. Hunham.

488
00:24:04.341 --> 00:24:06.799
I heard you got stuck with
babysitting duty this year.

489
00:24:06.882 --> 00:24:08.900
How'd you manage that?

490
00:24:08.983 --> 00:24:10.572
Oh, I don't know.

491
00:24:10.655 --> 00:24:12.805
I suppose I failed someone
who richly deserved it.

492
00:24:12.888 --> 00:24:15.368
Oh, the Osgood kid?

493
00:24:15.451 --> 00:24:17.304
Yeah, he was a real asshole.

494
00:24:17.387 --> 00:24:18.745
Rich and dumb.

495
00:24:18.828 --> 00:24:20.373
Popular combination around here.

496
00:24:20.456 --> 00:24:22.210
It's a plague.

497
00:24:22.293 --> 00:24:23.651
Uh, and you?

498
00:24:23.734 --> 00:24:25.213
You'll be here, too?

499
00:24:25.296 --> 00:24:27.281
All by my lonesome.

500
00:24:27.364 --> 00:24:29.591
My little sister Peggy
and her husband invited me

501
00:24:29.674 --> 00:24:33.892
to go visit them at Roxbury,
but I feel like it's too soon.

502
00:24:33.975 --> 00:24:36.499
Like Curtis will think
that I'm abandoning him.

503
00:24:36.582 --> 00:24:39.260
You know, this is the last place

504
00:24:39.343 --> 00:24:42.230
that my baby and I were together,

505
00:24:42.313 --> 00:24:44.788
-not including the bus station.
-Yeah.

506
00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:49.072
Well, I look forward to your fine cooking.

507
00:24:49.155 --> 00:24:50.678
Oh, no, no. Don't do that.

508
00:24:50.761 --> 00:24:52.944
All we've got is
whatever is in that walk-in.

509
00:24:53.027 --> 00:24:55.078
No new deliveries till January.

510
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:56.866
Hmm.

511
00:24:58.529 --> 00:25:00.397
You mind if I, um...

512
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:04.021
-You want some of that?
-Mm.

513
00:25:04.104 --> 00:25:06.529
-All right.
-(chuckles) Thank you.

514

00:25:08.339 --> 00:25:10.423

00:25:55.386 --> 00:25:56.843
They're storing the tools
and stuff in my room.

536
00:25:56.926 --> 00:25:58.009
That's what they told you?

537
00:25:58.092 --> 00:25:59.582
It's winter, idiot.

538
00:25:59.665 --> 00:26:01.683
Nobody renovates their house
in the winter.

539
00:26:01.766 --> 00:26:03.586
Your parents don't want you around

540
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:06.017
because you're a fucking
insecure sociopath.

541
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.150
JASON: Hey, take it easy, guys.

542
00:26:07.233 --> 00:26:08.415
A what?

543
00:26:08.498 --> 00:26:09.592
I mean, who'd want you for a son?

544
00:26:09.675 --> 00:26:11.319
That's why you grind everybody,

545
00:26:11.402 --> 00:26:13.563
because deep down
you know you're an asshole.

546
00:26:13.646 --> 00:26:16.665
Plus, academically, you're a disaster.

547
00:26:16.748 --> 00:26:20.394
I mean, if I were your parents,
I'd never want you home again.

548
00:26:20.477 --> 00:26:22.704
The only tool in your room is you.

549
00:26:22.787 --> 00:26:25.707
(yells, grunts)

550
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.694
(grunting, muttering)

551
00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:31.290
Bitch.

552
00:26:34.196 --> 00:26:35.585
-Come on! Come on!
-JASON: Hey, hey, hey!

553
00:26:35.668 --> 00:26:37.015
All right, all right.

554
00:26:37.098 --> 00:26:39.364
Break it up. Break it up. Break it up.

555
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:45.760
They weren't fighting.

556
00:26:45.843 --> 00:26:47.388
I see.

557
00:26:47.471 --> 00:26:50.028
And who started it... the not fighting?

558
00:26:50.111 --> 00:26:51.634
Hmm? Mr. Tully,

559
00:26:51.717 --> 00:26:54.577
perhaps you could shed
some light on the subject.

560
00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.903
Mr. Kountze?

561
00:26:56.986 --> 00:26:58.806
Mr. Smith?

562
00:26:58.889 --> 00:27:00.808
Mr. Ollerman?

563
00:27:00.891 --> 00:27:03.206
Mr. Park?

564
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:07.045
All right, then, uh, we'll
do it like the Roman legions.

565
00:27:07.128 --> 00:27:09.245
Absent a confession, one man's sin

566
00:27:09.328 --> 00:27:11.247
is every man's suffering.

567
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.283
For every minute the truth is withheld,

568
00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:16.956
you will all receive a detention.

569
00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:19.728
And I thought all the Nazis
were hiding in Argentina.

570
00:27:19.811 --> 00:27:21.780
Stifle it, Tully.

571
00:27:24.114 --> 00:27:26.933
Now, uh, in the first of said detentions,

572
00:27:27.016 --> 00:27:32.103
you will clean the library, top to bottom.

573
00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:34.171
Scraping the underside of the desks,

574
00:27:34.254 --> 00:27:37.339
which are caked with snot and gum

575
00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:41.409
and all manner of ancient,
unspeakable proteins.

576
00:27:41.492 --> 00:27:45.149
Ah, on your hands and knees,
down in the dust,

577
00:27:45.232 --> 00:27:49.153
breathing in the dead skin
of generations of students

578
00:27:49.236 --> 00:27:52.354
and desiccated cockroach assholes.

579
00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:53.795
It was Kountze!

580
00:27:53.878 --> 00:27:55.830
(Alex panting)

581
00:27:55.913 --> 00:27:57.915
Kountze started it.

582
00:27:58.918 --> 00:28:00.626
Bravo, Mr. Ollerman.

583
00:28:00.709 --> 00:28:03.052
Bravo.

584
00:28:04.088 --> 00:28:07.089
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

585
00:28:13.163 --> 00:28:14.965
(light laughter)

586
00:28:21.435 --> 00:28:23.649
Lovely.

587
00:28:23.732 --> 00:28:25.239
Thank you, Mary.

588
00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.528
Didn't we already have this for lunch?

589
00:28:34.611 --> 00:28:36.134
And it was crappy then.

590
00:28:36.217 --> 00:28:37.707
PAUL: Consider yourselves lucky.

591
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:41.634
During the Third Punic campaign,
149 to 146 BC,

592
00:28:41.717 --> 00:28:43.713
the Romans laid siege to Carthage

593
00:28:43.796 --> 00:28:45.880
for three entire years.

594
00:28:45.963 --> 00:28:47.673
-(door opens)
-By the time it ended,

595
00:28:47.756 --> 00:28:49.818
the Carthaginians
were reduced to eating sand

596
00:28:49.901 --> 00:28:51.820
and drinking their own urine.

597
00:28:51.903 --> 00:28:54.367
Hence the term "punitive."

598
00:28:56.305 --> 00:28:57.925
Uh... (sniffs) Mary?

599
00:28:58.008 --> 00:29:00.092
Maybe you would, uh...

600
00:29:00.175 --> 00:29:02.210
maybe you would care to join us?

601
00:29:09.219 --> 00:29:11.318
No, I'm all right. Thank you.

602
00:29:15.896 --> 00:29:18.671
(door opens and closes)

603
00:29:18.754 --> 00:29:21.883
I mean, I know she's sad
about her son and everything,

604
00:29:21.966 --> 00:29:24.446
but still, she's getting paid to do a job,

605
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:27.202
and she should do it well, right?

606
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:31.189
But I guess, no matter
how bad a cook she is,

607
00:29:31.272 --> 00:29:32.894
now they can never fire her.

608
00:29:32.977 --> 00:29:35.738
Will you shut up!

609
00:29:38.347 --> 00:29:41.199
You have no idea what
that woman has been thr...

610
00:29:41.282 --> 00:29:42.987
(sighs)

611
00:29:47.422 --> 00:29:49.306
You know, Mr. Kountze, for most people,

612
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:51.374
life is like a henhouse ladder.

613
00:29:51.457 --> 00:29:53.211
Shitty and short.

614
00:29:53.294 --> 00:29:56.643
You were born lucky.

615
00:29:56.726 --> 00:29:58.821
Maybe someday, you entitled
little degenerates

616
00:29:58.904 --> 00:30:00.383
will appreciate that.

617
00:30:00.466 --> 00:30:02.957
If you don't, I feel sorry for you

618
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.157
and we will have failed to do our jobs.

619
00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.275
Now, eat.

BOB EUBANKS (over TV): That's right.

(cheering and applause over TV)

631
00:30:57.787 --> 00:30:59.607
Next question for five points, girls.

632
00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.610
What are the dimensions
of the car you drive most?

633
00:31:02.693 --> 00:31:04.645
And that means width by length.

634
00:31:04.728 --> 00:31:06.647
The dimensions of the car
you drive most. Jerry?

635
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.715
JERRY (over TV): It's pretty long.

636
00:31:08.798 --> 00:31:11.553
Oh, let's see. Maybe, uh, 8 by 80?

637
00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:13.737
(laughter over TV)

638
00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:18.065
EUBANKS: What's the name
of your car, Union Pacific?

639
00:31:18.148 --> 00:31:19.462
(Paul clears throat)

640
00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:22.003
-Oh, good evening.
-Good evening.

641
00:31:22.086 --> 00:31:23.730
What's this?

642
00:31:23.813 --> 00:31:25.666
You don't know <i>The Newlywed Game?</i>

643
00:31:25.749 --> 00:31:27.833
-No.
-What planet have you been living on?

644
00:31:27.916 --> 00:31:30.011
I don't really watch television.

645
00:31:30.094 --> 00:31:32.145
It's a show where
they ask couples questions

646
00:31:32.228 --> 00:31:34.147
to see how well they know each other.

647
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.918
That sounds like courting disaster.

648
00:31:36.001 --> 00:31:38.921
Yeah, that's the whole damn point.

649
00:31:39.004 --> 00:31:40.582
Sit down.

650
00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:42.089
Come on.

651
00:31:42.172 --> 00:31:44.273
Broaden your horizons.

652
00:31:46.937 --> 00:31:50.163
(sighs) This is a rerun from July.

653
00:31:50.246 --> 00:31:52.495
Which is why they're playing
for Weber barbecues

654
00:31:52.578 --> 00:31:54.068
and picnic utensils.

655
00:31:54.151 --> 00:31:56.334
-PAUL: Fascinating.
-MARY: Mm-hmm.

656
00:31:56.417 --> 00:31:57.731
EUBANKS: If we ever take
separate vacations,

657
00:31:57.814 --> 00:31:59.205
I am sending my wife to blank...

658
00:31:59.288 --> 00:32:01.911
-Oh. Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

659
00:32:01.994 --> 00:32:04.062
(chatter continues over TV)

660
00:32:06.462 --> 00:32:09.611
So, how are the boys?

661
00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:12.400
Broken in body and spirit.

662
00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:17.190
Okay, well, it is the holidays,
so, you know, go easy on them.

663
00:32:17.273 --> 00:32:18.686
Oh, please.

664
00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:21.062
They've had it easy their whole lives.

665
00:32:21.145 --> 00:32:22.855
You don't know that.

666
00:32:22.938 --> 00:32:24.478
Did you?

667
00:32:25.976 --> 00:32:28.465
Besides, everybody should be
with their people on Christmas.

668
00:32:28.548 --> 00:32:30.203
-WOMAN: Hawaii, probably.
-EUBANKS: Hawaii. All right.

669
00:32:30.286 --> 00:32:31.468
He says he's gonna send you to Santa Ana

670
00:32:31.551 --> 00:32:33.404
and he's going to Las Vegas.

671
00:32:33.487 --> 00:32:34.944
MAN: Nobody can watch you in Siberia.

672
00:32:35.027 --> 00:32:36.638
Where are you going?

673
00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:38.805
-To Vegas.
-Las Vegas?

674
00:32:38.888 --> 00:32:41.478
-Yeah.
-(sighs)

675
00:32:41.561 --> 00:32:43.480
-No.
-(audience murmurs, laughs)

676
00:32:43.563 --> 00:32:45.812
Those two are going to get a divorce.

677
00:32:45.895 --> 00:32:47.451
How do you know?

678
00:32:47.534 --> 00:32:49.585
I recognize that look
of stale disappointment.

679
00:32:49.668 --> 00:32:51.587
-(chuckling)
-She hates him.

680
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.655
Oh.

681
00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:55.723
How long were you married?

682
00:32:55.806 --> 00:32:57.659
I was engaged to Curtis's father.

683
00:32:57.742 --> 00:33:00.827
-Mm.
-But he died before I gave birth.

684
00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.631
Harold.

685
00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:05.172
He worked in the shipyard.

686
00:33:05.255 --> 00:33:07.669
And one day, they was
carrying this big, uh,

687
00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:11.079
cargo pallet, and the cable snapped.

688
00:33:11.162 --> 00:33:13.065
Hit him right across the head.

689
00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:17.151
They were good men.

690
00:33:17.234 --> 00:33:18.647
Both of them.

691
00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:21.947
And neither of them made it to 25.

692
00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.604
My baby wasn't even 20.

693
00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:28.129
I'm so sorry.

694
00:33:28.212 --> 00:33:31.132
I took this job when Curtis was small

695
00:33:31.215 --> 00:33:32.859
because I wanted to ensure

696
00:33:32.942 --> 00:33:34.927
that he was going to have
a good education.

697
00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.468
-You know he flourished here.
-Yes. No, he was a great kid.

698
00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:38.865
-I had him one semester.
-Mm-hmm.

699
00:33:38.948 --> 00:33:40.504
Very insightful.

700
00:33:40.587 --> 00:33:42.655
Mm-hmm. He hated you.

701
00:33:44.131 --> 00:33:46.329
He said you were a real asshole.

702
00:33:47.398 --> 00:33:50.316
Well, uh, like I said... (chuckles)

703
00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:52.500
sharp kid. Insightful.

704
00:33:55.769 --> 00:33:58.654
He had his heart set on Swarthmore.

705
00:33:58.737 --> 00:34:01.492
And he had the grades,
but I didn't have the money.

706
00:34:01.575 --> 00:34:04.561
Even with financial aid, it wasn't enough.

707
00:34:04.644 --> 00:34:08.796
So, when he got called up
and no student deferment,

708
00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:10.749
off he went.

709
00:34:11.818 --> 00:34:13.669
Do you know what he said to me?

710
00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:17.640
He said, "Hey, Ma, look at the upside.

711
00:34:17.723 --> 00:34:22.464
When I get discharged, I can go
to college on the GI Bill."

712
00:34:24.534 --> 00:34:26.435

00:44:50.553 --> 00:44:52.472
-I go into town all the time.
-Oh.

895
00:44:52.555 --> 00:44:54.474
For groceries and various errands

896
00:44:54.557 --> 00:44:55.981
-and appointments.
-Mm-hmm.

897
00:44:56.064 --> 00:44:58.280
(sighs, stammers)

898
00:44:58.363 --> 00:45:01.151
Okay, yes, I don't leave campus often.

899
00:45:01.234 --> 00:45:02.647
I don't really feel the need.

900
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.385
Let me ask you something.

901
00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:07.828
If you could go anywhere
on Earth, where would you go?

902
00:45:07.911 --> 00:45:09.357
(chuckling): Oh.

903
00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.700
Greece, Italy,

904
00:45:11.783 --> 00:45:14.703
Egypt, Peru, Carthage.

905
00:45:14.786 --> 00:45:16.804
Tunisia now, of course.

906
00:45:16.887 --> 00:45:19.367
In college, I started
a monograph on Carthage.

907
00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.205
I'd like to finish that someday.

908
00:45:22.288 --> 00:45:25.846
(sighs) A monograph is
like a book, o-only shorter.

909
00:45:25.929 --> 00:45:28.013
I know what a monograph is.

910
00:45:28.096 --> 00:45:30.164
Why not just write a book?

911
00:45:31.871 --> 00:45:34.531
I'm not sure I have an entire book in me.

912
00:45:36.106 --> 00:45:39.206
You can't even dream
a whole dream, can you?

913
00:45:41.441 --> 00:45:43.980

with both of you.

Look at them.
Look at all the festive shapes.

938
00:48:32.445 --> 00:48:35.596
Snowflakes and gingerbread men. A tree.

939
00:48:35.679 --> 00:48:38.203

uh, I'll take a junior suite
or the equivalent.

950
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.726
I fully understand it's the holidays,

Mm-hmm. Yeah, sure.

I'll pay cash or traveler's checks.

I didn't say you could use the phone.

957
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.374
(chuckling): Okay, I see.

958
00:49:17.457 --> 00:49:18.375
Is there anywhere else
you could recommend?

959
00:49:18.458 --> 00:49:19.948
Maybe downtown or...

-Was that a hotel?
-None of your business.

961
00:49:22.132 --> 00:49:25.052
It is absolutely my business.
I'm looking after you.

962
00:49:25.135 --> 00:49:26.911
Looking after me? Really?

963
00:49:26.994 --> 00:49:28.990
-Like what? Like my warden?
-(scoffs)

There's nobody here, okay?

00:49:32.505 --> 00:49:34.325
Just us two losers and a grieving mom.

So let's cut the shit.

00:49:36.146 --> 00:49:38.065
You stay out of my way,
and I'll stay out of yours.

-That's a detention.
-(groans)

970
00:49:40.007 --> 00:49:41.629

Now, get back here!

Being here with you is already
one big fucking detention!

You are a hair's breadth from suspension.

I'll wash my hands of you, you hear me?

986
00:50:40.243 --> 00:50:42.245
Wash my hands.

You said you washed your hands of me.

1003

No, I meant it metaphorically!

1004
00:51:38.796 --> 00:51:40.715
Of course you meant it metaphorically.

1005
00:51:40.798 --> 00:51:43.751

actually go and wash your hands?

This is the end.

00:51:45.704 --> 00:51:48.052
They'll inform the school
who will inform your parents,

00:51:48.135 --> 00:51:49.592
and then it's curtains.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.723
we were over at Squantz Pond
playing hockey,

1022
00:52:21.806 --> 00:52:23.164

Angus, what are you doing?

1024
00:52:24.875 --> 00:52:27.795
My mom told him not to take me,
but I made him.

1025
00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.302
My folks are divorced.

1026
00:52:29.385 --> 00:52:31.062
We don't get to see each other very often.

1027
00:52:31.145 --> 00:52:33.306
She'll be mad as a hornet

-Please.

1031
00:52:38.328 --> 00:52:40.148
I never get to see my dad.

1032

We can pay cash.

00:52:55.004 --> 00:52:57.264
DOCTOR: So the good news is
nothing's broken,

1039
00:52:57.347 --> 00:52:59.926
but you did dislocate
your shoulder pretty badly.

1040
00:53:00.009 --> 00:53:01.796
What does that mean?

1041
00:53:01.879 --> 00:53:04.766
Well, that means that your arm
has popped out of the socket.

1042
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:07.456
And we just need to pop it back in.

1043
00:53:09.053 --> 00:53:11.229
I'm going to have you lie down.

1044
00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.644
-Nice and easy.
-Is this going to hurt?

Not if you relax.

1047
00:53:19.028 --> 00:53:22.636
The key is just to relax
as best as you can.

PAUL: Thank you.

1066
00:54:11.951 --> 00:54:14.000
Look, you said, if Woodrup
finds out, you're screwed,

1067
00:54:14.083 --> 00:54:15.375
so now he won't find out.

1068
00:54:15.458 --> 00:54:17.102
What happens if your parents inquire?

1069
00:54:17.185 --> 00:54:18.774

Okay, then. This all remains entre nous.

00:54:25.292 --> 00:54:27.211
Got it? You know what entre nous means?

1073
00:54:27.294 --> 00:54:29.290
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

1074
00:54:29.373 --> 00:54:30.753
Now you owe me.

1075
00:54:30.836 --> 00:54:32.623
Owe you?

1076
00:54:32.706 --> 00:54:34.922
Oh, do not try to leverage me, Mr. Tully.

1077
00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:37.364
All I'm looking for is a little thank-you

1078
00:54:37.447 --> 00:54:39.680
that I did something nice for you.

1079
00:54:40.815 --> 00:54:42.534
That's all.

1083

Get your cheeseburger.

-They've got Miller High Life.

Okay, you ready to order? Oh!

Miss Crane.

1088

As I live and breathe.

1089
00:55:04.408 --> 00:55:06.250
What-what... what are you doing here?

1090
00:55:06.333 --> 00:55:07.823
(laughing): Oh. Hi, guys.

1091
00:55:07.906 --> 00:55:09.759
Yeah, I always pick up a little extra work

1092
00:55:09.842 --> 00:55:11.332

We met outside Dr. Woodrup's office.

1098
00:55:21.018 --> 00:55:22.970
I was wrongly accused
of blowing up a toilet.

1099
00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:25.445

MISS CRANE: Okay.

1103
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:30.945
And a Miller High Life, please.

1104

PAUL: Uh, no, you will not.

1105
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.982
Where do you stand on
Miller High Life, Miss Crane?

1106
00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:38.854
Well, like they say,
it's the champagne of beers.

1107
00:55:38.937 --> 00:55:40.757
-And she's a professional.
-PAUL: Okay.

1108
00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.139

Okay, one cheeseburger.

1110

I will have a cheeseburger as well.

1113

Hmm.

I don't know, seeing her like this,

00:56:09.572 --> 00:56:10.853
I think she's pretty attractive.

1122
00:56:10.936 --> 00:56:13.493
Listen, you hormonal vulgarian,

1123
00:56:13.576 --> 00:56:15.891
that woman deserves your respect,

1124
00:56:15.974 --> 00:56:19.499
not your erotic speculation.

00:56:19.582 --> 00:56:21.468

-Ah.

1130

-and a double Jim.
-Oh.

So, how'd you get stuck holding over?

(chuckles) No, I know.

1137
00:56:49.612 --> 00:56:51.828
Uh, I'm being punished.

1138
00:56:51.911 --> 00:56:53.764
Yeah, Dr. Woodrup is, um...

1139
00:56:53.847 --> 00:56:55.931

00:56:59.787 --> 00:57:02.410
Uh, what I meant to say was, uh,

1143
00:57:02.493 --> 00:57:05.006
well, he's a lovely compassionate educator

1144

-with a really groovy beard.

1145
00:57:07.531 --> 00:57:10.242
Yeah. You know, I've had
a lot of former students

00:57:10.325 --> 00:57:12.013
ascend to positions of authority.

1147
00:57:12.096 --> 00:57:14.521
He's the only one
I've ever had to report to.

1148
00:57:14.604 --> 00:57:16.347
-He was your student?
-Oh, yes.

1149

My first year teaching,

1150
00:57:18.036 --> 00:57:20.087
and he was an asshole even then.

Yes. I tried to enlist in '41,
but was rejected.

1224
01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:33.753
I have to get in over there.

01:00:33.836 --> 01:00:36.382

01:00:36.465 --> 01:00:38.626
Gave me a whistle
and everything. (chuckles)

01:00:38.709 --> 01:00:41.629
Helmet, armband.

1228
01:00:41.712 --> 01:00:44.225
Yeah.

1229
01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.733
Before we get going,
can I be candid with you?

1230
01:00:46.816 --> 01:00:48.933
Mm-hmm.

1231
01:00:49.016 --> 01:00:50.688
You smell.

1232
01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:56.809
Like fish.

1233
01:00:56.892 --> 01:00:58.745
And it's really noticeable
towards the end of the day.

1234
01:00:58.828 --> 01:01:00.813
I can even smell it on your coat.

Trimethylaminuria.

1239
01:01:11.841 --> 01:01:14.519
Means my body can't
break down trimethylamine.

1240
01:01:14.602 --> 01:01:16.191
That's the smell.

1241
01:01:16.274 --> 01:01:19.799
And, uh, yes,
more toward the end of the day.

1242
01:01:19.882 --> 01:01:21.262
Wow.

1243
01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:24.364

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:37.989
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1418
01:09:38.072 --> 01:09:39.496
But, Danny, I didn't get you anything.

1419
01:09:39.579 --> 01:09:40.794
Yes, you did.

1420
01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:43.665
You got me that beautiful smile.

Oh. Huh.

1452
01:11:20.044 --> 01:11:22.302
Anyway, uh, I like your tree.

1453
01:11:22.385 --> 01:11:24.194

1454
01:11:24.277 --> 01:11:27.065

(Miss Crane sighs)

1457
01:11:32.892 --> 01:11:34.974
So, where's your family this Christmas?

1458
01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:36.811
Nowhere. I'm an only child.

1459
01:11:36.894 --> 01:11:38.549
Uh, my mother died when I was young.

1460
01:11:38.632 --> 01:11:39.748
Oh.

1461
01:11:39.831 --> 01:11:41.288
And your father?

1462
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:42.751
(chuckles)

1463
01:11:42.834 --> 01:11:44.984
Let's just say I left home when I was 15.

1464
01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:46.623
-You ran away?
-Worse.

1465
01:11:46.706 --> 01:11:49.120
-I got a scholarship to Barton.
-Oh.

1466
01:11:49.203 --> 01:11:52.959
And from there, I went to
college and never looked back.

1467
01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:55.434
-Oh, but you did a little.
-Hmm?

1468
01:11:55.517 --> 01:11:57.469
I mean, you came back here.

1469
01:11:57.552 --> 01:11:59.570
Ah.

1470
01:11:59.653 --> 01:12:02.342
Feels kind of like home. Yes.

1471
01:12:02.425 --> 01:12:05.136
And I guess I thought
I could make a difference.

1472
01:12:05.219 --> 01:12:08.073
I mean, I used to think I could
prepare them for the world

1473
01:12:08.156 --> 01:12:09.613
-even a little.
-Mm-hmm.

1474
01:12:09.696 --> 01:12:11.142
Provide standards and grounding

1475
01:12:11.225 --> 01:12:13.078
like Dr. Greene always drilled into us.

1476
01:12:13.161 --> 01:12:15.421
But, uh, the world doesn't
make sense anymore.

1477
01:12:15.504 --> 01:12:18.523
(chuckles): I mean, it's on fire.

1478
01:12:18.606 --> 01:12:20.690
The rich don't give a shit.

1479
01:12:20.773 --> 01:12:22.692
Poor kids are cannon fodder.

1480
01:12:22.775 --> 01:12:24.859
Integrity is a punch line.

1481
01:12:24.942 --> 01:12:27.367
Trust is just a name on a bank.

01:12:28.748 --> 01:12:30.799

1484
01:12:30.882 --> 01:12:33.505
look, if that's all true,

1485
01:12:33.588 --> 01:12:37.394
then now is when they most need
someone like you.

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:30.500
that it is not my fault
that you are stuck here?

01:16:30.583 --> 01:16:32.678
Do you think I want to be babysitting you?

1570
01:16:32.761 --> 01:16:36.110
Oh, no, no, I was praying to
the god I don't even believe in

1571
01:16:36.193 --> 01:16:37.947
that your mother would pick up the phone

1572
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:41.588

in a helicopter or a submarine

1573
01:16:41.671 --> 01:16:43.722

1848

Uh, more of a monograph.

-It's nothing special.
-Don't be so modest.

1850
01:33:10.186 --> 01:33:12.677
It's about, uh, cameras, right?
Ancient cameras?

-Oh.
-PAUL: Yes.

1852
01:33:14.454 --> 01:33:17.077
No, what he means, of course,
is the camera obscura.

and astronomical tool

1854

1870

Don't get me wrong, that was fun,

1871
01:34:04.306 --> 01:34:05.763
but you just lied through your teeth.

1872

What I say during a private conversation

1873
01:34:07.672 --> 01:34:09.393
is none of your goddamn business.

1874
01:34:09.476 --> 01:34:11.065
You are not to judge me.

1875
01:34:11.148 --> 01:34:12.803
It wasn't a private conversation.

1876
01:34:12.886 --> 01:34:14.332
-The wife and I were there.
-(groans)

1877
01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:15.938
-And I helped you.
-(Paul laughs)

1878
01:34:16.021 --> 01:34:17.775

1879
01:34:17.858 --> 01:34:19.436

1880
01:34:19.519 --> 01:34:21.075
-Jesus.
-You're the hard-ass

constantly telling everybody not to lie

1882
01:34:22.764 --> 01:34:25.063
and going on and on about the honor code.

1883
01:34:26.803 --> 01:34:28.753
There was an incident
when I was at Harvard

1884
01:34:28.836 --> 01:34:31.085
with my roommate.

1885
01:34:31.168 --> 01:34:32.988
And?

1886
01:34:33.071 --> 01:34:35.518
He accused me of copying
from his senior thesis.

1887
01:34:35.601 --> 01:34:36.794
Plagiarizing.

1888
01:34:36.877 --> 01:34:38.191
Ah.

1889
01:34:38.274 --> 01:34:41.865
-Well, did you?
-No, he stole from me.

1890
01:34:41.948 --> 01:34:43.493
But that blue-blooded prick's family

1891
01:34:43.576 --> 01:34:45.363
had allies on the faculty.

1892
01:34:45.446 --> 01:34:47.497
I mean, their last name is on
a library, for Christ's sake.

1893
01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.808
So he accused me in order
to sanitize his treachery

1894
01:34:50.891 --> 01:34:54.009
and, uh, they threw me out.

1895
01:34:54.092 --> 01:34:56.374
Wait, so you got kicked out
of Harvard for cheating?

1896
01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:58.508
No, I got kicked out of Harvard
for hitting him.

1897
01:34:58.591 --> 01:34:59.982
-(Paul chuckles)
-You hit him?

1898
01:35:00.065 --> 01:35:01.214
What, like punched him out?

1899
01:35:01.297 --> 01:35:03.546
No, I hit him with a car. Ah.

1900
01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:06.285
You got kicked out of Harvard
for hitting a guy with a car?

1901
01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:07.792
By accident.

Pint of Jim Beam, please.

1903
01:35:10.141 --> 01:35:13.160
But he broke three ribs,
which was technically his fault

1904
01:35:13.243 --> 01:35:14.799
because he shouldn't have been
in the road.

1905
01:35:14.882 --> 01:35:16.493
CASHIER: Two dollars, please.

1906
01:35:16.576 --> 01:35:18.528
-Also, he shat himself.
-(cash register bell dings)

1907
01:35:18.611 --> 01:35:20.332
Which was the greater indignity.

1908
01:35:20.415 --> 01:35:22.153
(laughs)

1909
01:35:23.156 --> 01:35:24.584
Here you go, killer.

1910
01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:27.471
(cash register drawer closes)

1911
01:35:27.554 --> 01:35:29.847
ANGUS: So Mr. Hunham
never even graduated college?

1912
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:31.541
-PAUL: Mm.
-Holy shit.

1913
01:35:31.624 --> 01:35:33.345
You didn't finish up
somewhere else? Who else knows?

1914
01:35:33.428 --> 01:35:35.248
Well, Dr. Greene knew.

1915
01:35:35.331 --> 01:35:37.756
Only Dr. Greene.

1916
01:35:37.839 --> 01:35:40.682
He always believed in me,
so he gave me a job.

1917
01:35:40.765 --> 01:35:44.323
Adjunct faculty,
zero respect and even less pay.

1918
01:35:44.406 --> 01:35:46.160
So nobody batted an eye,

1919
01:35:46.243 --> 01:35:48.360
and I've been at the school ever since.

1920
01:35:48.443 --> 01:35:50.197
Are you ashamed at how things turned out?

1921
01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.167
Not at all. I'm proud of my work.

1922
01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:55.367
I love history. I love Barton.

1923
01:35:55.450 --> 01:35:57.006
Barton is my life.

1924
01:35:57.089 --> 01:35:59.008
I don't know what I would do
without Barton.

1925
01:35:59.091 --> 01:36:00.779
Why'd you lie to that guy?

1926
01:36:00.862 --> 01:36:03.111
Because I knew he'd relish
the fact that I'm a washout

1927
01:36:03.194 --> 01:36:04.948
and never left my own high school,

1928
01:36:05.031 --> 01:36:06.675
and he'd probably repeat that story

1929
01:36:06.758 --> 01:36:08.446
to everybody we used to know,

1930
01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:11.614
so I figured he's not
entitled to my story.

1931
01:36:11.697 --> 01:36:13.055
I am.

1932
01:36:13.138 --> 01:36:14.958
Yeah. Yeah, fuck that guy.

1933
01:36:15.041 --> 01:36:18.060
Yeah, exactly. Fuck that guy.

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.136

01:48:46.792 --> 01:48:49.091
And when I do, it'll be my own fault.

2118
01:48:50.666 --> 01:48:54.965
Get sent to Fork Union
and maybe to you-know-where.

2119
01:48:56.837 --> 01:48:59.002
And nobody will care.

2120
01:49:02.469 --> 01:49:04.502
The funny thing is...

2121
01:49:06.748 --> 01:49:09.749
I wanted to see him so bad
this whole time.

2122
01:49:16.351 --> 01:49:18.450
But I also didn't, you know?

2123
01:49:21.488 --> 01:49:23.009
Because I'm afraid

2124
01:49:23.092 --> 01:49:24.307
that's what's going to happen
to me one day.

2125
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:25.979
No, Angus, Angus.

2126
01:49:26.062 --> 01:49:27.750
Angus, listen.

2127
01:49:27.833 --> 01:49:30.099
You're not your father.

2128
01:49:31.267 --> 01:49:32.755
How do you know?

2129
01:49:32.838 --> 01:49:35.417
Because no one is his own father.

2130
01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.188
I'm not my dad.

2131
01:49:37.271 --> 01:49:40.274
No matter how hard he tried
to beat that idea into me.

2132
01:49:46.315 --> 01:49:50.036
I find the world a bitter
and complicated place,

2133
01:49:50.119 --> 01:49:53.105
and it seems to feel
the same way about me.

2134
01:49:53.188 --> 01:49:55.487
I think you and I have this in common.

2135
01:49:56.963 --> 01:49:59.782
But don't get me wrong,
you have your challenges.

2136
01:49:59.865 --> 01:50:01.509
You're erratic and belligerent

2137
01:50:01.592 --> 01:50:03.412
and a gigantic pain in the balls,

2138
01:50:03.495 --> 01:50:05.381
but you're not your father.

2139
01:50:05.464 --> 01:50:08.005
You're your own man.

2140
01:50:10.339 --> 01:50:12.388
Man, no. You're just a kid.

2141
01:50:12.471 --> 01:50:14.126
You're just beginning.

2142
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:16.211
And you're smart.

2143
01:50:17.412 --> 01:50:20.347
You've got time to turn things around.

2144
01:50:22.219 --> 01:50:24.268
Yes, I know the Greeks had the idea

2145
01:50:24.351 --> 01:50:26.611
that, uh, the steps you take
to avoid your fate

2146
01:50:26.694 --> 01:50:28.613
are the very steps that lead you to it,

2147
01:50:28.696 --> 01:50:30.615
but that's just a literary conceit.

2148
01:50:30.698 --> 01:50:32.617
In real life, your history

2149
01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:34.883
does not have to dictate your destiny...

2150
01:50:34.966 --> 01:50:37.413
Oh. There's Mary.

2151
01:50:37.496 --> 01:50:39.657
Can you not tell Mary or anybody? Uh...

2152
01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:42.418
Entre nous. This whole
goddamned trip is entre nous.

2153
01:50:42.501 --> 01:50:44.778
-Stand up.
-What?

2154
01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:47.665

MARY: Oh. Thank you.

2162
01:51:03.731 --> 01:51:05.848
Hello, ma'am. Would you like
a cocktail to start?

2163
01:51:05.931 --> 01:51:07.850
Oh, no, I'll just take a cup of tea.

2164
01:51:07.933 --> 01:51:09.280
Oh, come on. Have a cocktail.

2165
01:51:09.363 --> 01:51:10.952
No, no, no. A cup of tea is fine.

2166
01:51:11.035 --> 01:51:12.954
I've eaten already.

2167
01:51:13.037 --> 01:51:15.759
And you gentlemen,
did you save room for dessert?

2168
01:51:15.842 --> 01:51:18.289
-PAUL: Hmm.
-Hey, what's that?

2169
01:51:18.372 --> 01:51:20.159

2170
01:51:20.242 --> 01:51:21.699

-PAUL: Mmm.

01:51:21.782 --> 01:51:23.426
-That sounds great.
-(Paul chuckles)

cherries jubilee.

2173
01:51:26.017 --> 01:51:27.804
I'm afraid I can't.

2174
01:51:27.887 --> 01:51:29.773
The dish contains brandy.

2175
01:51:29.856 --> 01:51:32.138
Same deal with the bananas Foster.

2176
01:51:32.221 --> 01:51:34.173
-Yeah, but doesn't the alcohol just burn off?
-PAUL: Mm.

2177
01:51:34.256 --> 01:51:36.010
WAITRESS: It's still

2178
01:51:36.093 --> 01:51:37.638
-Fine.
-Oh.

2179
01:51:37.721 --> 01:51:39.640
I'll order the cherries
jubilee. We can share it.

2180
01:51:39.723 --> 01:51:42.148
Mm. I can't allow that, either.

2181
01:51:42.231 --> 01:51:44.546
Can we say it's his birthday?

2182
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:46.053
It's my birthday.

2183
01:51:46.136 --> 01:51:48.121
Well, happy birthday, young man.

2184
01:51:48.204 --> 01:51:49.892
Let's get you a slice of cake

2185
01:51:49.975 --> 01:51:51.696

01:51:59.822 --> 01:52:02.522
Uh, excuse me, ma'am. Do you,
by chance, have cherries?

2189
01:52:03.518 --> 01:52:05.039
Yes.

2190
01:52:05.122 --> 01:52:07.470
Great. And do you have ice cream?

2191
01:52:07.553 --> 01:52:09.637
-Yes.
-MARY: Fantastic.

2192
01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:13.047

and ice cream to go?

2193
01:52:13.130 --> 01:52:14.675

01:57:19.436 --> 01:57:20.948
the boy and me to your party.

2291
01:57:21.031 --> 01:57:22.026
And Mary.

2292
01:57:22.109 --> 01:57:23.225
It meant a lot.

2293
01:57:23.308 --> 01:57:24.655
Oh, you're so welcome.

2294
01:57:24.738 --> 01:57:26.195
It was fun.

2295
01:57:26.278 --> 01:57:29.198
Um, Dr. Woodrup is asking to see you.

2296
01:57:29.281 --> 01:57:30.727
He says it's urgent.

2297
01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:32.647

2300
01:58:02.613 --> 01:58:06.026
DR. WOODRUP: <i>Mr. Hunham, meet
Judy and Stanley Clotfelter.</i>

2301
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:08.567
Angus Tully's mother and father.

2302
01:58:08.650 --> 01:58:10.404
-Stepfather.
-Hello.

2303
01:58:10.487 --> 01:58:12.208
Good morning.

2304
01:58:12.291 --> 01:58:14.078
They've brought something
very important to my attention.

2305
01:58:14.161 --> 01:58:15.673
STANLEY: We understand you took Angus

2306
01:58:15.756 --> 01:58:17.180
to Boston over the holidays.

2307
01:58:17.263 --> 01:58:19.006
I explained to Mr. Clotfelter

2308
01:58:19.089 --> 01:58:21.118
that you went on a field trip
for academic reasons.

2309
01:58:21.201 --> 01:58:22.350
That's right.

2310
01:58:22.433 --> 01:58:24.253
A field trip?

2311
01:58:24.336 --> 01:58:26.915
Yes. Uh, as per my instructions
in the manual,

2312
01:58:26.998 --> 01:58:29.720
it fell within the ambit
of my responsibility.

2313
01:58:29.803 --> 01:58:32.459
Well, if it was a school trip,
then how do you explain this?

2314
01:58:32.542 --> 01:58:34.098
The people at the sanitarium

2315
01:58:34.181 --> 01:58:36.529
confiscated it from my ex-husband.

2316
01:58:36.612 --> 01:58:39.351
Apparently, Angus had given it to him.

2317
01:58:48.087 --> 01:58:50.312
My mom and Stanley are here.

2318
01:58:50.395 --> 01:58:52.710
Lydia told me.

2319
01:58:52.793 --> 01:58:54.861
I think I'm going to get kicked out.

2320
01:58:56.436 --> 01:58:58.601
That means military school.

2321
01:59:14.553 --> 01:59:17.273
JUDY: <i>Angus knows he's not
supposed to visit his father.</i>

2322
01:59:17.356 --> 01:59:20.441
He suffers from
debilitating mental illness.

2323
01:59:20.524 --> 01:59:23.312
Paranoid schizophrenia,
early-onset dementia.

2324
01:59:23.395 --> 01:59:26.909
And Angus's visit created an expectation.

2325
01:59:26.992 --> 01:59:30.517
Now Tom wants to come home, which is...

2326
01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:33.113
clearly impossible.

2327
01:59:33.196 --> 01:59:35.357
They tried to tell him, and he just...

2328
01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:37.755
He got violent. He tried
to brain one of the orderlies

2329
01:59:37.838 --> 01:59:39.493
with this goddamned thing.

2330
01:59:39.576 --> 01:59:42.122
You people know the boy has
a discipline problem.

2331
01:59:42.205 --> 01:59:45.169
Paul, the Clotfelters want
to withdraw Angus from Barton

2332
01:59:45.252 --> 01:59:48.535
and enroll him
at Fork Union Military Academy.

2333
01:59:48.618 --> 01:59:50.966
STANLEY: Set him straight
once and for all.

2334
01:59:51.049 --> 01:59:53.375
He could do a lot worse
than a career in the military.

2335
01:59:53.458 --> 01:59:55.135
Stanley.

2336
01:59:55.218 --> 01:59:58.281
Look, Angus has defied me lots of times

2337
01:59:58.364 --> 02:00:00.514
about a lot of things, including this.

2338
02:00:00.597 --> 02:00:02.879
So, however he manipulated your sympathies

2339
02:00:02.962 --> 02:00:06.933
or slipped the leash, just tell us.

2340
02:00:21.114 --> 02:00:23.257

2342

No, uh, uh, he didn't, uh,
trick me or slip the leash.

02:00:31.661 --> 02:00:34.845
No, I took him to see his father.

2344
02:00:34.928 --> 02:00:38.371
In fact, I convinced him to do so.

2345
02:00:41.376 --> 02:00:43.590
This is a family matter,

2346
02:00:43.673 --> 02:00:45.658

02:01:02.626 --> 02:01:04.545
I have to move Tom now.

2354
02:01:04.628 --> 02:01:07.207
It was hard even finding
a facility that would take him,

2355
02:01:07.290 --> 02:01:11.079
and now I have to move him.

2356
02:01:11.162 --> 02:01:14.016
And that is deeply unfortunate,

2357
02:01:14.099 --> 02:01:18.411
but why compound the misery
by ruining the boy?

2358
02:01:19.909 --> 02:01:22.299
I have just spent
two solid weeks with him.

2359
02:01:22.382 --> 02:01:26.402
He is a pain in the ass, sure,
but he's also very smart.

2360
02:01:26.485 --> 02:01:29.537
Brilliant, I don't know, but very smart.

2361
02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:32.100
You must know that.

2362
02:01:32.183 --> 02:01:35.202
He's got enormous potential.

2363
02:01:35.285 --> 02:01:39.366
It would be devastating
if you pulled him out now.

2364

(door opens)

2365
02:01:52.744 --> 02:01:56.157

-I want you to remember that.
-Mm.

2367

Hardy, I have known you
since you were a boy,

2368
02:02:03.885 --> 02:02:06.101
