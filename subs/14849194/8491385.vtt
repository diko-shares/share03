and saw that it's not so simple
to keep the damn school afloat.

174
00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:42.870
I begged you,
begged you to give the kid a C-minus.

175
00:11:42.953 --> 00:11:47.541
No. There are instructors here
who will do that. I am not one of them.

176
00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:55.674
Here's the manual
and a full set of keys.

177
00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:58.010
Everything you need to know
is in there.

178
00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:02.681
Your only task is to ensure the boys'
absolute safety and good condition.

179
00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:06.310
And at least pretend to be a human being.

180
00:12:07.144 --> 00:12:10.105
Please. It's Christmas.

181
00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:19.615
Fuck this half-day bullshit.
Where the hell is Walleye?

182
00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:22.034
He's probably jerking off
in the Cobb salad.

183
00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.245
- Why would he do that?
- [Kountze] 'Cause he's Walleye.

184
00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:27.456
Who knows what that
foul-smelling freak does?

185
00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.625
But you went straight
to the Cobb salad.

186
00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:33.962
I mean, do you know something?
'Cause I eat that Cobb salad.

187
00:12:34.046 --> 00:12:38.133

00:12:39.593 --> 00:12:40.969

[groans]

192
00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:18.090
I can tell by your faces that many of you
are shocked at the outcome.

193
00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:20.092
I, on the other hand, am not,

194
00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:23.637
because I have had the misfortune
of teaching you this semester.

195
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.848
And even with my ocular limitations,

196
00:13:26.932 --> 00:13:32.187
I witnessed firsthand
your glazed, uncomprehending expressions.

197
00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:34.356
Sir, I don't understand.

198
00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.274
That's glaringly apparent.

199
00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:39.486
No, it's... I can't fail this class.

200
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.863
Oh, don't sell yourself short,
Mr. Kountze.

201
00:13:41.947 --> 00:13:43.615
I truly believe that you can.

202
00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:45.659
I'm supposed to go to Cornell.

203
00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:47.703
Unlikely.

204
00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.705
Please, sir. My dad's gonna flip out.

[chattering]

206
00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.457
- Mine too.
- Come on.

207
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.629
All right. All right.

208
00:13:57.713 --> 00:13:59.631
Uh, in the spirit of the season,

209
00:13:59.715 --> 00:14:03.343
I suppose the most constructive way
of dealing with your shortcomings

210
00:14:03.427 --> 00:14:06.972
is to offer a makeup exam.

211
00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.599
You'll all get a second run at this
after break.

212
00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.309
- [scoffs]
- [students murmuring]

213
00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:16.148
Of course, it will not be the same exam.

214
00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:19.401
You will now be responsible
for new material as well.

215
00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.653
- [students sighing]
- Your grade will be an average of the two.

216
00:14:21.737 --> 00:14:24.740
Please open your books to chapter six.

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:27.367
The Peloponnesian War,
gentlemen.

218
00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:28.910
You've already met Pericles.

219
00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:31.580
Now prepare yourselves
to meet Demosthenes.

220
00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:33.665
No offense, sir.

221
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:36.543
But is this really the best time
to be starting a new chapter?

222
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:42.257
I mean, we all appreciate the, uh,
makeup exam gesture,

223
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.342
but our families are here.

224
00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.261
You know, most teachers
have already canceled class.

225
00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.680
We have chapel in 40 minutes,
then we're out of here.

226
00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:51.433
- Mmm.
- [Tully] I mean, our heads are elsewhere.

227
00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:54.895
And where exactly is your head, Mr. Tully?

228
00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:58.023
I don't know. Saint Kitts. [chuckles]

229
00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:02.444
[chuckles] Yes, indeed.
I see you've brought your valise.

230
00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:07.908
Spot on, sir. It's just that it's been
a really exhausting semester.

231
00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:10.660
Getting into new material now
right before break?

232
00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:15.540
Honestly, it's a little absurd, sir.

233
00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:22.089
Well, I would hate to be absurd.

234
00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:25.634
So let's just scuttle the whole thing,
shall we?

235
00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:27.677
Let the original grade stand.

[students groaning, murmuring]

237
00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:34.643
Uh, excuse me, sir. I think, uh,
we all liked the first option better.

238
00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:36.645
What'd you say the guy's name was?
Uh, Demos...

239
00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:39.147
Of course, I still expect you
to be familiar with chapter six

240
00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:42.651
upon your return,
so pack those textbooks, boys.

241
00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:47.405
And if displeased, take it up
with your champion Mr. Tully.

242
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:50.367
Dismissed.

I've been lonely, too.
And what about Boston?

311
00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:44.017
You promised on the way
we'd spend some time in Boston.

<i>Angus, listen to me.
This is our new family. Okay?</i>

- Mom, please don't do this. Please.

[Hunham] I suspect that like me, this is
not how you wanted to spend your holidays.

322
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.552
But such are the vicissitudes of life.

323
00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:23.390

we learn to confront our challenges

of courage and good fellowship.

332

we will be following
a standard school schedule...

Sir? Uh, sir, we're on vacation.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.803
...which means we will be
taking our meals together,

335
00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:04.055
and you will observe
regular hours of study.

on the next semester.

00:37:11.647 --> 00:37:12.648
Hey!

684
00:37:12.731 --> 00:37:14.108
[laughs] That's what you get

685
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:15.984
for ratting me out,
you little Mormon!

686
00:37:16.068 --> 00:37:18.695
- [grunts, laughs]
- [Alex] What?

687
00:37:19.405 --> 00:37:21.865
- [Teddy] Let's go!
- What's Fork Union?

688
00:37:21.949 --> 00:37:25.452
Uh, before, you said you don't want
to end up at Fork Union.

689
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.831
It's a military academy in Virginia.

690
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.875
That's where I'm going if I get
kicked out of school again.

691
00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:34.586
How many schools
have you been kicked out of?

692
00:37:36.004 --> 00:37:37.005
Three.

693
00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:39.216
[scoffs] That's why I'm still a junior.

694
00:37:39.299 --> 00:37:41.385
- Give or take a semester.
- [Alex] It's gone!

695
00:37:42.553 --> 00:37:43.887
My glove's gone.

696
00:37:43.971 --> 00:37:47.057
Twisted fucker
orphaned that glove on purpose.

697
00:37:47.141 --> 00:37:50.436
Left you with one so the loss
would sting that much more.

698
00:38:15.002 --> 00:38:17.171

701
00:39:02.508 --> 00:39:03.717
You all right?

702
00:39:04.885 --> 00:39:06.678
I had a nightmare.

703
00:39:06.762 --> 00:39:08.847
I get nightmares too.

704
00:39:08.931 --> 00:39:11.183
I'm always falling or drowning.

705
00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:12.267
Also...

706
00:39:13.393 --> 00:39:15.312
[sobs]

707
00:39:15.395 --> 00:39:17.105
I had an accident.

708
00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:25.197
Yeah, you did.

709
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.950
Shh. Stop crying.

710
00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:30.536
If they hear you,
they'll crucify you.

711
00:39:30.619 --> 00:39:33.330
Which would be ironic
since you're Buddhist.

712
00:39:33.413 --> 00:39:35.916
I know this is
an excellent school,

713
00:39:35.999 --> 00:39:38.752
and my brothers went here,

714
00:39:38.835 --> 00:39:40.879
but I miss my family

715
00:39:40.963 --> 00:39:43.090
and I have no friends.

716
00:39:43.173 --> 00:39:44.174
[sobbing]

717
00:39:44.258 --> 00:39:47.427
Yeah, well, friends are overrated.

718
00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:51.473
I'll help you hide the sheets
in the morning, all right?

719
00:39:51.557 --> 00:39:54.560
In the meantime, find a dry spot
and try to get some sleep.

720
00:39:54.643 --> 00:39:57.145
[sniffles] Thank you.

721
00:40:02.818 --> 00:40:04.027

It's only 11:00,
and he's already lit.

725
00:40:36.685 --> 00:40:38.103
I can smell the whiskey on him.

726
00:40:38.186 --> 00:40:40.772
Can you blame him?
It's freezing in here.

727
00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:43.233
It's fucking Greenland in here.

[Jason] I knew it!
He finally caved, the big softy.

732
00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:33.617
Hey, any of you guys like to ski?

733
00:41:38.705 --> 00:41:40.374
Thank you.

734
00:41:40.457 --> 00:41:42.334
Goodbye, now.

735
00:41:42.417 --> 00:41:45.003
[no audible dialogue]

736
00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:49.966
Yes!

737
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:58.809
Well, good news, gentlemen.

738
00:41:58.892 --> 00:42:01.353
I was able to reach Dr. Woodrup
and your parents.

739
00:42:01.436 --> 00:42:03.855
Uh, most of them, anyway.

740
00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:07.776
Try calling again.
Just one more time, please.

741
00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:09.027
There's no point.

742
00:42:09.111 --> 00:42:10.737
The front desk says
they're not answering.

743
00:42:10.821 --> 00:42:12.698
He says they're away
on some excursion.

744
00:42:13.365 --> 00:42:14.991
- Excursion.
- [chuckles]

745
00:42:15.075 --> 00:42:18.036
I'm as disappointed as you are,
if not more so.

746
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.913
I could have been spending
the rest of my vacation

747
00:42:19.996 --> 00:42:21.206
reading mystery novels.

748
00:42:21.289 --> 00:42:24.501
Okay. Maybe they're back now.
Just call again, please.

749
00:42:25.752 --> 00:42:26.753

752
00:42:39.224 --> 00:42:40.434
Take care, Tully.

753
00:42:42.644 --> 00:42:44.396
I guess that just leaves you, huh?

754
00:42:45.188 --> 00:42:47.065

you were looking for.

Nothing.

I don't know. I like being alone.

783
00:44:30.836 --> 00:44:33.964
I've always found myself drawn
to the ascetic.

784

Like a monk.

785
00:44:36.675 --> 00:44:40.387
The forgoing of sensual pleasures
for the achievement of spiritual goals.

you even left campus?

792

804
00:45:16.923 --> 00:45:19.467
In college, I started
a monograph on Carthage.

I'd like to finish that someday.

806

just write a book?

00:49:27.507 --> 00:49:29.092
- Like what? Like my warden?
- [scoffs]

861
00:49:29.175 --> 00:49:30.635
Like my butler?

862
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:32.846
- There's nobody here, okay?
- [sighs]

863
00:49:32.929 --> 00:49:34.931
Just us two losers
and a grieving mom.

864
00:49:35.014 --> 00:49:36.141
So let's cut the shit.

865
00:49:36.224 --> 00:49:38.143
You stay out of my way,
and I'll stay out of yours.

866
00:49:38.226 --> 00:49:40.019
- That's a detention.
- [groans]

867
00:49:40.103 --> 00:49:42.063
You just earned yourself
a detention, sir.

868
00:49:42.147 --> 00:49:43.148
Now, get back here!

869
00:49:43.231 --> 00:49:46.401
Being here with you is already
one big fucking detention!

870
00:49:46.484 --> 00:49:48.945
Son of a bitch,
that's another detention!

871
00:49:49.028 --> 00:49:50.780
["Deck the Halls" playing]

872
00:49:50.864 --> 00:49:51.948
Mr. Tully!

873
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.286
I don't know what you're
playing at, Mr. Tully,

874
00:49:56.369 --> 00:49:58.830
but you are courting disaster!

875
00:49:58.913 --> 00:50:01.374
Without exercise, the body devours itself.

876
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.210
You are careening
towards suspension!

877
00:50:04.294 --> 00:50:05.628
[groans]

878
00:50:09.174 --> 00:50:11.176

[breathing heavily]

880
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:33.198
Don't even think about it, Mr. Tully.

881
00:50:33.865 --> 00:50:36.451
You are a hair's breadth
from suspension.

882
00:50:37.619 --> 00:50:40.246
I'll wash my hands of you,
you hear me?

883
00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:41.789
Wash my hands.

884
00:50:45.335 --> 00:50:46.836
Stop right there.

885
00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:50.048
You know the gym is
strictly off-limits.

886
00:50:51.674 --> 00:50:53.343
This is your Rubicon.

887
00:50:53.426 --> 00:50:56.638
Do not cross the Rubicon.

888
00:51:00.683 --> 00:51:02.393

Oh, fuck! Ow!

891
00:51:18.785 --> 00:51:21.329
Jesus, Mr. Hunham! Fuck!

892
00:51:22.538 --> 00:51:23.998
Hurry up! Hurry!

893
00:51:24.082 --> 00:51:25.416
I am hurrying!

894
00:51:26.084 --> 00:51:27.752
I was on thin ice already.

895
00:51:27.835 --> 00:51:29.963
If Woodrup finds out,
the facts won't matter.

896
00:51:30.046 --> 00:51:31.965
- He'll make it my fault.
- It is your fault!

897
00:51:32.048 --> 00:51:33.967
You were supposed to be
looking after me.

898
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:35.551
I told you to stop!

899
00:51:35.635 --> 00:51:37.303
You said you washed
your hands of me.

900
00:51:37.387 --> 00:51:41.224
- No, I meant it metaphorically!
- Of course you meant it metaphorically.

901
00:51:41.307 --> 00:51:43.810
What were you going to do,
actually go and wash your hands?

902
00:51:43.893 --> 00:51:45.019
This is the end.

903
00:51:45.812 --> 00:51:48.231
They'll inform the school,
who will inform your parents,

904
00:51:48.314 --> 00:51:50.316
and then it's curtains. [chuckles]

905
00:51:51.526 --> 00:51:52.944
You're gonna get me fired.

906
00:51:54.028 --> 00:51:56.322
You. [scoffs]

907
00:51:56.406 --> 00:51:59.534
I'm the one that might lose an arm,
and all you can think about is yourself.

908
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.496
[nurse] If you could fill this out,
please. Admissions and insurance.

909

[sighs]

910
00:52:09.294 --> 00:52:10.295
Excuse me.

911
00:52:13.298 --> 00:52:16.050
Is there any way we could skip
this whole insurance thing?

912
00:52:16.134 --> 00:52:17.802
It's just standard procedure.

913
00:52:17.885 --> 00:52:19.512
[Tully] I understand,
but look, um,

914
00:52:20.305 --> 00:52:22.140
we were over at Squantz Pond
playing hockey,

915
00:52:22.223 --> 00:52:23.266
and I slipped on the ice.

916
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:24.892
Angus, what are you doing?

917
00:52:24.976 --> 00:52:27.186
My mom told him not to take me,
but I made him.

918
00:52:28.813 --> 00:52:31.149
My folks are divorced. We don't get
to see each other very often.

919
00:52:31.232 --> 00:52:33.401
She'll be mad as a hornet
if she finds out.

920
00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:36.612
[nurse] Okay, that's your business,
but we just have certain protocols.

921
00:52:36.696 --> 00:52:38.323
- Yeah. Protocols.
- Please.

922
00:52:38.406 --> 00:52:40.241
I never get to see my dad.

923
00:52:40.325 --> 00:52:42.076
It was my fault. All mine.

924
00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:44.912
I don't want to get him
in any trouble.

925
00:52:45.538 --> 00:52:47.498
I don't want her dragging you
into court again.

926
00:52:48.166 --> 00:52:50.335
We can skip the insurance thing.

927
00:52:50.418 --> 00:52:51.627
We can pay cash.

928
00:52:53.046 --> 00:52:54.047
Right, Dad?

929
00:52:55.048 --> 00:52:57.342
[doctor] So the good news is
nothing's broken,

930
00:52:57.425 --> 00:52:59.969
but you did dislocate
your shoulder pretty badly.

931
00:53:00.053 --> 00:53:01.471
What does that mean?

932
00:53:01.554 --> 00:53:04.849
[doctor] Well, that means that your arm
has popped out of the socket,

933
00:53:04.932 --> 00:53:07.477
and we just need to
pop it back in.

934
00:53:09.312 --> 00:53:10.938
I'm going to have you lie down.

935
00:53:13.232 --> 00:53:15.151
- Nice and easy.
- Is this going to hurt?

936
00:53:15.234 --> 00:53:16.986
- [groaning]
- Any more than it does now?

937
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:18.529
Not if you relax.

938
00:53:19.113 --> 00:53:22.658
The key is just to relax
as best as you can.

939
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.914
- [Tully groaning, gasping]

- Do what?

Barton men don't lie.

948
00:53:52.688 --> 00:53:54.732
Yeah, well, I had momentum.

949
00:53:54.816 --> 00:53:55.817
Mm-hmm.

950
00:54:00.905 --> 00:54:01.906
Hello.

00:54:07.328 --> 00:54:09.330
Uh, give me a couple minutes.

954
00:54:09.414 --> 00:54:10.665
Thank you.

955
00:54:12.208 --> 00:54:14.377
Look, you said if Woodrup finds out,
you're screwed.

956
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.213
- So now he won't find out.
- What happens if your parents inquire?

957
00:54:17.296 --> 00:54:20.091
[scoffs] Never gonna happen. Trust me.

958
00:54:21.843 --> 00:54:25.680
Okay, then.
This all remains <i>entre nous.</i>

959
00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:27.265

You know what <i>entre nous</i> means?

00:54:27.348 --> 00:54:28.975
<i>Oui,</i> monsieur.

961
00:54:29.684 --> 00:54:30.810
Now you owe me.

962
00:54:30.893 --> 00:54:32.270
Owe you?

963
00:54:32.979 --> 00:54:35.440
Oh, do not try to leverage me,
Mr. Tully.

964
00:54:35.523 --> 00:54:39.235
All I'm looking for is a little thank-you
that I did something nice for you.

965
00:54:40.862 --> 00:54:41.863
That's all.

- They got Miller High Life.
- Mmm.

- The champagne of beers.
- Oh.

972
00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.132
Okay, you ready to order? Oh!

[laughs] Oh. Hi, guys.

976
00:55:08.014 --> 00:55:09.849
Yeah, I always pick up
a little extra work

00:55:09.932 --> 00:55:11.392
over Thanksgiving
and Christmas.

978
00:55:11.476 --> 00:55:12.477
Ah.

We met outside Dr. Woodrup's office.

I was wrongly accused
of blowing up a toilet.

Where do you stand

00:55:35.124 --> 00:55:38.920
Well, like they say,
it's the champagne of beers.

one cheeseburger.

Hmm.

That's the Percodan talking.

I don't know, seeing her like this,
I think she's pretty attractive.

go to the bathroom?

Sir?

1012
00:56:24.298 --> 00:56:25.633
You mean the pay phone?

1013
00:56:34.141 --> 00:56:35.309
- Okay.
- Ah.

- and a double Jim.
- Oh.

1016

I charged you for a single.

- Thank you.
- [chuckles]

- Chin-chin.
- Mm-hmm.

So, how'd you get stuck
holding over?

1020

I thought it was
Mr. Endicott's year.

Uh, I'm being punished.

Yeah, Dr. Woodrup is, um...

1024
00:56:53.911 --> 00:56:56.414
A pompous ass
with a dictator complex?

[both chuckle]

1026
00:56:58.416 --> 00:56:59.750
Oops. Um...

1027
00:56:59.834 --> 00:57:02.503
Uh, what I meant to say was, uh...

1028
00:57:02.587 --> 00:57:05.089
Well, he's a lovely
compassionate educator

- with a really groovy beard.
- [both laugh]

a lot of former students

He's the only one

01:24:27.063 --> 01:24:28.606
Right. Um...

1542
01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:30.816
Mary, can I help you with your bags?

1543
01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.777
[Mary] Yes, please.

1544
01:24:41.619 --> 01:24:42.787
- [Hunham] Hmm.
- [trunk closes]

1545
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:44.497
Mmm.

1546
01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:47.875
- Hey, be careful with the box.
- Yeah.

1547
01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:52.380
You know, you're more than
welcome to a room at the hotel.

1548
01:24:52.463 --> 01:24:53.798
We've got the money.

1549
01:24:53.881 --> 01:24:55.591
Are you out of your mind?

1550
01:24:55.675 --> 01:24:58.177
I need a break from you two
and all your damn bickering.

1551
01:24:58.261 --> 01:25:00.846
Besides, I'm looking forward
to visiting my little sister.

1552
01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:02.265
She's pregnant.

1553
01:25:02.348 --> 01:25:03.683
Oh, that's wonderful.

1554
01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:04.934
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1555
01:25:06.978 --> 01:25:09.105
- Mr. Hunham. Mr. Hunham.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1556
01:25:09.188 --> 01:25:10.523
My hands sweat.

1557
01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:12.358
It's hyperhidrosis. Sorry.

1558
01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:13.734
- Oh.
- [Tully] Hey, Mary!

1559
01:25:16.529 --> 01:25:18.030
One more flight up.

1560
01:25:19.115 --> 01:25:20.658
One more flight up.

1561
01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:22.076
Yep.

1562
01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:23.786
So, you two are going to be all right?

1563
01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:25.413
Yes, the little monster
will be well under control.

1564
01:25:25.496 --> 01:25:27.498
- [Peggy] Mary!
- Oh.

1565
01:25:28.582 --> 01:25:30.293
Hi!

1566
01:25:33.212 --> 01:25:35.214
- Bye.
- Bye.

1567
01:25:39.719 --> 01:25:41.053
Bye, Mary.

1568
01:25:41.137 --> 01:25:42.513
Uh-uh. Where are you going?

1569
01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:43.931
- I was...
- You're not done yet.

1570
01:25:44.015 --> 01:25:45.975
You have to help me up there.

1571
01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:48.394
- Yeah, sure thing.
- Come on.

Hmm.

1578

Hey there, handsome.
You got a cigarette?

1579
01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:00.109
Nope. Sorry, I smoke a pipe.

1580
01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:04.071
How about a date, then? You want a date?

1581

[chuckles]

1582
01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:07.658
No, thank you.

1583
01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:09.160
- Oh, come on.
- Mm-mm-mm.

1584
01:28:09.243 --> 01:28:10.995
Let's go somewhere warm.

1585
01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:12.830
Go ahead.

1586
01:28:12.913 --> 01:28:15.082
- I can wait here.
- [prostitute] See?

1587
01:28:15.166 --> 01:28:18.002
He can wait here, read some books.

1588
01:28:18.085 --> 01:28:21.046
He doesn't mind if daddy gets
a little candy cane.

1589
01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:24.550
Thank you, but I never really
liked candy canes.

1590
01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:26.594
Plus, I'm prediabetic.

1591
01:28:34.393 --> 01:28:36.770
You know, if you do want
a little candy cane,

1592
01:28:36.854 --> 01:28:38.939
I won't tell anyone.

1593
01:28:39.023 --> 01:28:40.900
Mr. Tully, for most people,

1594
01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:44.945
sex is 99% friction
and 1 % goodwill.

1595
01:28:45.029 --> 01:28:48.157
Call me old-fashioned,
but I place value on physical intimacy.

1596
01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.326
So should you.

1597
01:28:50.409 --> 01:28:52.161
You've never had sex, have you?

1598
01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:53.996
[laughs]

1599
01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:56.123
Believe it or not, Mr. Tully,
there was a time

1600
01:28:56.207 --> 01:28:58.250
when the fire in my loins
burned white hot.

1601
01:28:58.334 --> 01:28:59.752
You're full of shit.

1602
01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:02.630
No, the details would curl your toes.

1603
01:29:02.713 --> 01:29:06.008
Okay, we're finally getting
to the good stuff. Let's hear.

1604
01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:08.177
Maybe when you're 18.

1605
01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.595
Curl your toes!

1606
01:29:21.815 --> 01:29:23.484
[Tully] Are we almost done?

1607
01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:25.653
[Hunham] What's your hurry?
I thought you liked antiquity.

1608
01:29:25.736 --> 01:29:27.279
[chuckles] In class, maybe,

1609
01:29:27.363 --> 01:29:29.365
but I never think about it
unless I need to.

1610
01:29:29.448 --> 01:29:31.534
Ah. Ah, well, here.

1611
01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:33.786
What do you see?

1612
01:29:35.329 --> 01:29:37.498
I don't know. A bunch of pottery.

1613
01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:40.543
Mmm. Look at that one.

1614
01:29:48.551 --> 01:29:50.135
- It's candy cane.
- [laughs] Yes.

1615
01:29:50.844 --> 01:29:53.347
There's nothing new
in human experience, Mr. Tully.

1616
01:29:54.348 --> 01:29:56.725
Each generation thinks
it invented debauchery

1617
01:29:56.809 --> 01:29:58.727
or suffering or rebellion,

1618
01:29:58.811 --> 01:30:04.024
but man's every impulse and appetite
from the disgusting to the sublime

1619
01:30:04.108 --> 01:30:08.112
is on display right here all around you.

1620
01:30:08.195 --> 01:30:11.865
So, before you dismiss something
as boring or irrelevant, remember,

1621
01:30:11.949 --> 01:30:15.369
if you truly want to understand
the present or yourself,

1622
01:30:15.452 --> 01:30:18.372
you must begin in the past.

1623
01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:21.166
You see, history is not simply
the study of the past.

1624
01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:24.169
It is an explanation of the present.

1625
01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:29.925
See, when you say it that way
and throw in some pornography,

1626
01:30:30.009 --> 01:30:31.927
it's a lot easier to understand.

1627
01:30:32.011 --> 01:30:33.887
[chuckles] Okay.

1628
01:30:33.971 --> 01:30:37.349
You should try doing more of
that in class and less yelling.

1629
01:30:37.433 --> 01:30:40.185
You know, most of the kids dislike you.
Pretty much hate you.

1630

01:33:01.577 --> 01:33:03.120
Um, tell him about your book,
Uncle Paul.

1677

[chuckles] My book.

1678
01:33:04.872 --> 01:33:06.457
It's not a book, really.

1679
01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.041
Uh, more of a monograph.

1680
01:33:08.125 --> 01:33:10.169
- It's nothing special.
- Don't be so modest.

1681
01:33:10.252 --> 01:33:12.713
It's about, uh, cameras, right?
Ancient cameras?

1682
01:33:12.796 --> 01:33:14.423
- Oh.
- [Hunham] Yes.

1683
01:33:14.506 --> 01:33:17.134
No, what he means, of course,
is the camera obscura.

You know, the optical
and astronomical tool

of, um, Anaxagoras.

Tell him the title, Uncle Paul.

1687

but you just lied through your teeth.

01:34:26.829 --> 01:34:28.789
There was an incident
when I was at Harvard

1711
01:34:28.872 --> 01:34:30.374
with my roommate.

1712
01:34:31.708 --> 01:34:33.043
And?

1713
01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:35.587
He accused me of copying
from his senior thesis.

1714
01:34:35.671 --> 01:34:36.839
Plagiarizing.

1715
01:34:36.922 --> 01:34:38.257
Ah.

1716
01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:41.927
- Well, did you?
- No, he stole from me.

1717
01:34:42.678 --> 01:34:45.430
But that blue-blooded prick's family
had allies on the faculty.

1718
01:34:45.514 --> 01:34:47.558
I mean, their last name
is on a library, for Christ's sake.

1719
01:34:47.641 --> 01:34:50.853
So he accused me in order
to sanitize his treachery

1720
01:34:50.936 --> 01:34:53.063
and, uh, they threw me out.

1721
01:34:54.147 --> 01:34:56.441
Wait, so you got kicked out
of Harvard for cheating?

1722
01:34:56.525 --> 01:34:58.569
No, I got kicked out of Harvard
for hitting him.

1723
01:34:58.652 --> 01:35:00.028
- [Hunham chuckles]
- You hit him?

1724
01:35:00.112 --> 01:35:01.280
What, like punched him out?

1725
01:35:01.363 --> 01:35:03.615
No, I hit him with a car. Ah.

1726
01:35:03.699 --> 01:35:06.660
You got kicked out of Harvard
for hitting a guy with a car?

1727
01:35:06.743 --> 01:35:08.078
By accident.

1728
01:35:08.161 --> 01:35:10.122
Pint of Jim Beam, please.

1729
01:35:10.205 --> 01:35:13.208
But he broke three ribs,
which was technically his fault

1730
01:35:13.292 --> 01:35:14.835
because he shouldn't have
been in the road.

1731
01:35:14.918 --> 01:35:16.545
[cashier] Two dollars, please.

1732
01:35:16.628 --> 01:35:18.589
- Also, he shat himself...
- [cash register bell dings]

1733
01:35:18.672 --> 01:35:22.092
...which was the greater indignity.
[laughs]

1734
01:35:23.176 --> 01:35:24.511
Here you go, killer.

1735
01:35:25.596 --> 01:35:27.514
[cash register drawer closes]

1736
01:35:27.598 --> 01:35:29.892
[Tully] So Mr. Hunham
never even graduated college?

1737
01:35:29.975 --> 01:35:31.602
- [Hunham] Mmm.
- Holy shit.

1738
01:35:31.685 --> 01:35:33.395
You didn't finish up somewhere else?
Who else knows?

1739
01:35:33.478 --> 01:35:37.816
Well, Dr. Greene knew.
Only Dr. Greene.

1740
01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:40.736
He always believed in me,
so he gave me a job.

1741
01:35:40.819 --> 01:35:45.032
Adjunct faculty,
zero respect and even less pay.

1742
01:35:45.115 --> 01:35:48.410
So nobody batted an eye,
and I've been at the school ever since.

1743
01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:50.245
Are you ashamed
at how things turned out?

1744
01:35:50.329 --> 01:35:53.206
Not at all. No, I'm proud of my work.

1745
01:35:53.290 --> 01:35:55.459
I love history. I love Barton.

1746
01:35:56.126 --> 01:35:59.046
Barton is my life. I don't know what
I would do without Barton.

1747
01:35:59.129 --> 01:36:00.797
Why'd you lie to that guy?

1748
01:36:00.881 --> 01:36:03.175
Because I knew he'd relish
the fact that I'm a washout

1749
01:36:03.258 --> 01:36:05.010
and never left my own high school,

1750
01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:08.513
and he'd probably repeat that story
to everybody we used to know,

1751
01:36:08.597 --> 01:36:11.683
so I figured he's not entitled
to my story.

1752
01:36:11.767 --> 01:36:13.101
I am.

1753
01:36:13.185 --> 01:36:15.020
Yeah. Yeah, fuck that guy.

1754
01:36:15.103 --> 01:36:18.106
Yeah, exactly. Fuck that guy.

1755
01:36:18.190 --> 01:36:20.651
"Statistics." [scoffs]

1756
01:36:20.734 --> 01:36:23.612
But, now, you'll keep this quiet, right?

1757
01:36:23.695 --> 01:36:25.447
No one is to know.

1758
01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:28.200
I mean no one, Angus.

1759
01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:31.286
<i>Entre nous,</i> sir.
<i>Entre nous.</i>

1760
01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:35.916
"Ancient cameras." Where the hell did
you come up with that? [laughs]

1761
01:36:35.999 --> 01:36:38.168
[Tully] Just trying to keep you
on your toes, sir.

1762
01:36:47.761 --> 01:36:48.804
Get up, kid.

1763
01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:51.932
It's daylight in the swamp.

1764
01:36:53.934 --> 01:36:55.769
I ordered breakfast.

1765
01:36:57.104 --> 01:36:59.398
Great. [sighs]

1766
01:37:10.659 --> 01:37:12.953
Oh, you dropped something.

1767
01:37:13.036 --> 01:37:14.997
[grunts]

1768
01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.207
Uh, those are my vitamins.

1769
01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:19.001
Librium.

1770
01:37:19.084 --> 01:37:20.877
Yeah, it's just, uh,

1771
01:37:20.961 --> 01:37:23.130
something I'm supposed
to take for low energy.

1772
01:37:23.213 --> 01:37:24.423
You mean depression?

1773
01:37:26.633 --> 01:37:27.843
Is that rye toast?

1774
01:37:27.926 --> 01:37:30.303
How'd you know I like
rye toast?

1775
01:37:41.648 --> 01:37:42.816
[sighs]

1776
01:37:57.122 --> 01:38:00.125
[chattering]

1777
01:38:04.337 --> 01:38:07.007
All right. This way.

1778
01:38:38.246 --> 01:38:39.831
[pins clatter]

1779
01:38:46.797 --> 01:38:47.881
[chuckles]

1780
01:38:49.341 --> 01:38:50.550
Let go lightly.

1781
01:38:50.634 --> 01:38:51.968
- Ah.
- You're too rigid.

1782
01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.185
[pins clatter]

1783
01:39:00.811 --> 01:39:02.771
- See? You're welcome.
- [Hunham laughs]

1784
01:39:02.854 --> 01:39:05.649
That's not bad.
You're a pretty good teacher, kid.

1785
01:39:05.732 --> 01:39:09.236
Too bad everybody dislikes you.
Pretty much hates you.

1786
01:39:09.319 --> 01:39:11.780
But you must know that,
right?

1787
01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:15.242
Touché, sir. Touché.

1788
01:39:18.954 --> 01:39:20.705
- By the way...
- Yeah?

1789
01:39:20.789 --> 01:39:22.874
...what eye do you aim with, anyway?

1790
01:39:22.958 --> 01:39:24.251
Ah.

1791
01:39:24.334 --> 01:39:26.128
You know, I've been meaning to ask.

1792
01:39:26.211 --> 01:39:27.963
When we're talking,
which one should I look at?

1793
01:39:28.046 --> 01:39:29.881
Sometimes I look at one,

1794
01:39:29.965 --> 01:39:32.425
but then I think I'm wrong,
so I look at the other.

1795
01:39:32.509 --> 01:39:34.594
Yes, everybody does that.

1796
01:39:34.678 --> 01:39:36.388
So, which eye is it?

1797
01:39:36.471 --> 01:39:38.098
[chuckles]

1798
01:39:39.766 --> 01:39:42.769
[chattering]

1799
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:57.284
[scoffs]
People don't understand.

1800
01:39:57.367 --> 01:39:59.202
This isn't tenpin.

1801
01:39:59.286 --> 01:40:01.037
No, this is much harder.

1802
01:40:01.121 --> 01:40:04.166
All these tenpin assholes
coming in here like they're slumming it.

1803
01:40:04.249 --> 01:40:05.542
- The hell with them.
- [grunts]

1804
01:40:05.625 --> 01:40:07.169
Yeah. Fuck 'em.

1805
01:40:10.046 --> 01:40:11.339
Excuse me.

1806
01:40:12.090 --> 01:40:14.176
Here's something I bet you didn't know.

1807
01:40:14.259 --> 01:40:19.181
Your uniform, festive as it is,
is historically inaccurate.

1808
01:40:19.264 --> 01:40:22.392
Saint Nicholas of Myra was actually

1809
01:40:22.475 --> 01:40:25.437
a fourth-century Greek Bishop
from what is now Turkey.

1810
01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.940
So, uh, a robe and sandals
would be closer to the mark.

1811
01:40:29.024 --> 01:40:32.068
Yeah, but I guess that would be
impractical given the weather

1812
01:40:32.152 --> 01:40:34.613
and all the silly but lucrative
mythology about Santa

1813
01:40:34.696 --> 01:40:38.158
and elves and reindeer
and chimneys and whatnot.

1814
01:40:38.241 --> 01:40:40.619
[chuckles] What can you do?

1815
01:40:40.702 --> 01:40:43.705
As Democritus said... [speaking Greek]

1816
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.004
"World is decay. Life is perception."

1817
01:40:58.094 --> 01:40:59.304
<i>My son.</i>

1818
01:41:00.096 --> 01:41:03.642
<i>To see you again causes
my heart to soar like a hawk.</i>

1819
01:41:03.725 --> 01:41:08.271
<i>Grandfather,
I brought you this present.</i>

1820
01:41:08.355 --> 01:41:10.690
<i>Is this the hat I used to own?</i>

1821
01:41:10.774 --> 01:41:13.235
- [chuckles]
<i>- Except grown softer...</i>

1822
01:41:13.318 --> 01:41:15.237
You know,
this is not only amusing,

1823
01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.405
uh, but for a movie,
it's a fairly accurate depiction

1824
01:41:17.489 --> 01:41:19.074
of life among the Cheyenne.

1825
01:41:19.157 --> 01:41:21.243
- Shh!
- Fuck off.

1826
01:41:21.326 --> 01:41:23.370
[Old Lodge Skins] <i>I saw you in a dream.</i>

1827
01:41:23.453 --> 01:41:24.996
- I'm gonna go use the bathroom.
- Mm-hmm.

1828
01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:29.334
<i>You were drinking from a spring that
came from the long nose of an animal.</i>

1829
01:41:29.417 --> 01:41:33.380
<i>I did not recognize the animal.</i>

1830
01:41:33.463 --> 01:41:37.425
<i>Alongside his nose, he grew two horns.</i>

1831
01:41:37.509 --> 01:41:39.511
[movie continues indistinctly]

1832
01:41:51.523 --> 01:41:53.817
<i>...and smoked on this matter,</i>

1833
01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:56.403
<i>and my decision is...</i>

1834
01:41:56.486 --> 01:41:58.613
<i>Little Big Man has returned.</i>

1835
01:41:58.697 --> 01:42:01.700
[cheering, whooping on screen]

1836
01:42:11.668 --> 01:42:13.878
Hey! Hey!

1837
01:42:15.797 --> 01:42:17.382
No! Out!

1838
01:42:20.093 --> 01:42:22.012
- Get out.
- I just need to do something.

1839
01:42:22.095 --> 01:42:24.180
I was going to come back.
Or meet you at the hotel.

1840
01:42:24.264 --> 01:42:25.932
It won't take long. It's nothing bad.

1841
01:42:26.016 --> 01:42:28.935
Just get out, you conniving little shit.

1842
01:42:29.853 --> 01:42:30.854
[sighs]

1843
01:42:32.105 --> 01:42:34.357
Were you planning this
the whole time?

1844
01:42:34.441 --> 01:42:37.027
Just counting the minutes
until I turned my back?

1845
01:42:37.110 --> 01:42:38.945
I wasn't running away.

1846
01:42:39.029 --> 01:42:42.407
There's just something I need to do
before we go back to school. Please.

1847
01:42:42.490 --> 01:42:44.951
You could come with me.
Just come with me, okay?

1848
01:42:45.035 --> 01:42:46.411
Come with you where?

1849
01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:49.581
To see my dad.

1850
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.126
Your dad?

1851
01:42:54.127 --> 01:42:55.503
[sighs]

1852
01:42:55.587 --> 01:42:57.130
That's what this is about?

1853
01:42:57.213 --> 01:42:59.799
Why didn't you just ask me?

1854
01:42:59.883 --> 01:43:03.053
Because of course
we can visit a cemetery.

1855
01:43:28.495 --> 01:43:30.580
Excuse me. Hi.

1856
01:43:47.013 --> 01:43:48.848
Right in here.

1857
01:44:03.655 --> 01:44:04.656
[orderly] Over here.

1858
01:44:07.784 --> 01:44:09.786
Look who's here to see you.

1859
01:44:14.833 --> 01:44:15.834
Hi, Dad.

1860
01:44:17.377 --> 01:44:19.379
[singsongy] Hello, sweetheart.

1861
01:44:39.149 --> 01:44:41.609
You want to go sit down
for a little?

1862
01:44:43.903 --> 01:44:46.656
Oh. Come on.

1863
01:44:46.739 --> 01:44:48.741
Be seated right here.

1864
01:44:53.246 --> 01:44:55.582
There you go. All right.

1865
01:45:06.801 --> 01:45:07.844
I missed you.

1866
01:45:09.554 --> 01:45:11.431
I've missed you a lot.

1867
01:45:12.182 --> 01:45:14.058
A whole lot.

1868
01:45:16.895 --> 01:45:19.147
You know, I'm still at school.

1869
01:45:20.231 --> 01:45:21.608
At Barton.

1870
01:45:21.691 --> 01:45:25.570
And it's, uh, it's Christmastime now,
so I thought you might like a visit.

1871
01:45:28.364 --> 01:45:29.991
Guess what. I'm...

1872
01:45:30.074 --> 01:45:32.577
I'm actually keeping
my grades up.

1873
01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:36.164
I-I consistently get the highest grades
in the class in ancient civ.

1874
01:45:36.247 --> 01:45:39.667
I'm... I'm pretty much
third or fourth in precalc.

1875
01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:45.423
And I'm in the chess club too.

1876
01:45:46.841 --> 01:45:48.593
But I don't really like
the other kids.

1877
01:45:48.676 --> 01:45:50.053
[chuckles]

1878
01:45:51.387 --> 01:45:54.432
And in the spring,
I think I want to try tennis.

1879
01:45:54.516 --> 01:45:56.100
Just JV,
and probably only doubles,

if the coach could just forget
about my, uh...

1881
01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:02.273
Anyway, it's not important.

1882
01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:11.574
Listen.

1883
01:46:18.748 --> 01:46:21.584
I, uh... I have to tell you something.

1884
01:46:26.089 --> 01:46:28.841
I think they're putting
something in my food.

1885
01:47:03.334 --> 01:47:05.753
He used to be fine.

1886
01:47:05.837 --> 01:47:08.298
He was better than fine.

1887
01:47:08.381 --> 01:47:10.133
He was great.

1888
01:47:11.551 --> 01:47:13.678
[voice breaking] He was my dad.

1889
01:47:16.014 --> 01:47:20.727
Then about four years ago,
he started acting strange.

1890
01:47:22.145 --> 01:47:24.856
Erratic, forgetful,
saying all this weird shit.

1891
01:47:27.442 --> 01:47:30.486
My mom took him
to a bunch of doctors,

1892
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:32.113
and they put him on medication.

1893
01:47:32.196 --> 01:47:36.659
But that just made it worse.
He got more confused.

1894
01:47:39.329 --> 01:47:41.205
Then he got angry.

1895
01:47:43.708 --> 01:47:44.709
And then he got...

1896
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:47.670
physical.

1897
01:47:50.381 --> 01:47:53.843
That was it. That was the last straw.
They put him away.

1898
01:47:55.428 --> 01:47:56.929
And she divorced him...

1899
01:47:59.057 --> 01:48:01.017
without him even realizing it.

1900
01:48:02.727 --> 01:48:05.021
That's why she wants a whole new life.

1901
01:48:06.648 --> 01:48:08.900
And it's easy to just stash me away
in boarding school.

1902
01:48:08.983 --> 01:48:11.569
Like half of us
are just stashed away there.

1903
01:48:14.197 --> 01:48:15.990
And I get it.

1904
01:48:17.909 --> 01:48:20.036
She never has to look at me.

1905
01:48:22.121 --> 01:48:25.208
Because maybe when
she looks at me, she...

1906
01:48:25.291 --> 01:48:28.503
- she sees him.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1907
01:48:28.586 --> 01:48:32.256
That can't be true.
She... You're her son.

1908
01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:34.676
Maybe she's right.

1909
01:48:34.759 --> 01:48:36.678
I can't keep it together.

1910
01:48:36.761 --> 01:48:38.930
I lie. I steal.

1911
01:48:40.306 --> 01:48:42.266
I piss people off.

1912
01:48:43.601 --> 01:48:45.144
I don't have any friends,
real friends.

1913
01:48:45.228 --> 01:48:46.771
I'll probably get kicked out
of Barton too.

1914
01:48:46.854 --> 01:48:49.065
And when I do, it'll be my own fault.

1915
01:48:50.692 --> 01:48:54.946
Get sent to Fork Union
and maybe to you-know-where.

1916
01:48:56.864 --> 01:48:58.991
And nobody will care.

1917
01:49:02.495 --> 01:49:04.497
The funny thing is...

1918
01:49:06.749 --> 01:49:09.711
I wanted to see him so bad
this whole time.

1919
01:49:16.384 --> 01:49:18.428
But I also didn't, you know?

1920
01:49:21.514 --> 01:49:24.350
Because I'm afraid that's what's
going to happen to me one day.

1921
01:49:24.434 --> 01:49:26.018
No, Angus, Angus.

1922
01:49:26.102 --> 01:49:27.812
Angus, listen.

1923
01:49:27.895 --> 01:49:30.064
You're not your father.

1924
01:49:31.274 --> 01:49:32.817
How do you know?

1925
01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:35.486
Because no one is
his own father.

1926
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:37.238
I'm not my dad,

1927
01:49:37.321 --> 01:49:40.241
no matter how hard he tried
to beat that idea into me.

1928
01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:50.084
I find the world
a bitter and complicated place,

1929
01:49:50.168 --> 01:49:53.171
and it seems to feel
the same way about me.

1930
01:49:53.254 --> 01:49:55.506
I think you and I
have this in common.

1931
01:49:56.966 --> 01:49:59.844
But don't get me wrong,
you have your challenges.

1932
01:49:59.927 --> 01:50:03.473
You're erratic and belligerent
and a gigantic pain in the balls,

1933
01:50:03.556 --> 01:50:05.433
but you're not your father.

1934
01:50:05.516 --> 01:50:07.935
You're your own man.

1935
01:50:10.354 --> 01:50:12.440
Man, no. You're just a kid.

1936
01:50:12.523 --> 01:50:14.192
You're just beginning.

1937
01:50:14.275 --> 01:50:16.235
And you're smart.

1938
01:50:17.445 --> 01:50:20.323
You've got time
to turn things around.

1939
01:50:22.241 --> 01:50:24.327
Yes, I know
the Greeks had the idea

1940
01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:26.746
that, uh, the steps you take
to avoid your fate

1941
01:50:26.829 --> 01:50:30.666
are the very steps that lead you to it,
but that's just a literary conceit.

1942
01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:35.171
In real life, your history does not
have to dictate your destiny...

1943
01:50:35.254 --> 01:50:37.465
Oh. There's Mary.

1944
01:50:37.548 --> 01:50:39.717

[Mary] Oh. Thank you.

1956
01:51:03.783 --> 01:51:06.744
Hello, ma'am. Would you like
a cocktail to start?

1957

Oh, no,
I'll just take a cup of tea.

Oh, come on. Have a cocktail.

1959

No, no, no. A cup of tea is fine.
I've eaten already.

1960
01:51:13.084 --> 01:51:15.795
And you, gentlemen,
did you save room for dessert?

1961
01:51:15.878 --> 01:51:18.339

1962

[waiter] That's our signature dessert.

1963
01:51:20.299 --> 01:51:21.759

- [Hunham] Mmm.

1964
01:51:21.843 --> 01:51:23.469

- [Hunham chuckles]

- Fine.
- Oh.

Yes.

1982
01:52:05.761 --> 01:52:07.513
Great.
And do you have ice cream?

01:55:47.566 --> 01:55:49.026
[Tully laughs]

2050
01:55:49.110 --> 01:55:50.653
You think that's funny, Tully?

2051
01:55:51.737 --> 01:55:55.032
No, man.
Just glad you had a good vacation.

2052
01:55:55.116 --> 01:56:00.079
Welcome back, you snarling Visigoths.

2053
01:56:00.162 --> 01:56:02.832
I trust you all enjoyed
a refreshing holiday.

2054
01:56:03.624 --> 01:56:06.252
Oh, hello, Mr. Kountze.

2055
01:56:06.335 --> 01:56:08.212
Or should I say Icarus?

2056
01:56:08.295 --> 01:56:10.339
Fly a little too close to the sun, did we?

2057
01:56:11.132 --> 01:56:13.217
- Huh?
- Yeah.

2058
01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:14.635
Uh, all right.

2059
01:56:14.718 --> 01:56:16.846
Now, along with your skiing and swimming,

2060
01:56:16.929 --> 01:56:18.764
I hope you found time
to enlighten yourselves

2061
01:56:18.848 --> 01:56:21.934
about the Peloponnesian War
and its implications for today.

2062
01:56:22.017 --> 01:56:24.353
Just to check, we're going
to start with a short pop quiz

2063
01:56:24.436 --> 01:56:26.021
- on the reading...
- [students groaning]

2064
01:56:26.105 --> 01:56:27.940
...before we retake the final
from last semester.

2065
01:56:28.023 --> 01:56:30.276
<i>Omnia ex scrineis praeter stilum.</i>

2066
01:56:30.359 --> 01:56:32.194
[students groaning, murmuring]

2067
01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:07.605
Excuse me, Mr. Hunham?

2068
01:57:08.981 --> 01:57:10.983
Oh, Miss Crane.

2069
01:57:11.066 --> 01:57:13.861
Lydia. Uh, come in. Happy New Year.

2070
01:57:13.944 --> 01:57:16.071
Oh, same to you. Happy New Year.

2071
01:57:16.155 --> 01:57:17.656
Forgive me. I'm a clod.

2072
01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:20.993
I never called to thank you for inviting
the boy and me to your party.

2073
01:57:21.076 --> 01:57:22.077
And Mary.

2074
01:57:22.161 --> 01:57:23.287
It meant a lot.

2075
01:57:23.370 --> 01:57:24.705
Oh, you're so welcome.

2076
01:57:24.788 --> 01:57:26.248
It was fun.

2077
01:57:26.332 --> 01:57:29.501
Um, Dr. Woodrup is asking to see you.

2078
01:57:29.585 --> 01:57:30.794
He says it's urgent.

2079
01:57:30.878 --> 01:57:31.921
Oh.

2080
01:57:35.049 --> 01:57:37.051
[chattering]

2081
01:57:45.643 --> 01:57:46.769
[knocks on door]

2082
01:58:02.618 --> 01:58:06.080
[Dr. Woodrup] <i>Mr. Hunham,
meet Judy and Stanley Clotfelter.</i>

2083
01:58:06.163 --> 01:58:08.624
Angus Tully's mother and father.

2084
01:58:08.707 --> 01:58:10.459
- Stepfather.
- Hello.

2085
01:58:10.542 --> 01:58:12.211
Good morning.

2086
01:58:12.294 --> 01:58:14.505
They've brought something
very important to my attention.

2087
01:58:14.588 --> 01:58:17.216
[Stanley] We understand you took Angus
to Boston over the holidays.

2088
01:58:17.299 --> 01:58:20.719
I explained to Mr. Clotfelter
that you went on a field trip

2089
01:58:20.803 --> 01:58:22.388
- for academic reasons.
- That's right.

2090
01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:24.306
A field trip?

2091
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:26.976
Yes. Uh, as per my instructions
in the manual,

2092
01:58:27.059 --> 01:58:29.770
it fell within the ambit
of my responsibility.

2093
01:58:29.853 --> 01:58:32.523
Well, if it was a school trip,
then how do you explain this?

2094
01:58:32.606 --> 01:58:36.568
The people at the sanitarium
confiscated it from my ex-husband.

2095
01:58:36.652 --> 01:58:39.280
Apparently, Angus had given it to him.

2096
01:58:48.372 --> 01:58:49.873
My mom and Stanley are here.

2097
01:58:50.457 --> 01:58:51.750
Lydia told me.

2098
01:58:52.835 --> 01:58:54.837
I think I'm going to get
kicked out.

2099
01:58:56.463 --> 01:58:58.590
That means military school.

2100
01:59:14.565 --> 01:59:17.318
[Judy] <i>Angus knows
he's not supposed to visit his father.</i>

2101
01:59:17.401 --> 01:59:20.487
He suffers from
debilitating mental illness:

2102
01:59:20.571 --> 01:59:23.365
paranoid schizophrenia,
early-onset dementia.

2103
01:59:23.449 --> 01:59:26.952
And Angus's visit created
an expectation.

2104
01:59:27.036 --> 01:59:30.581
Now Tom wants to come home,
which is...

2105
01:59:30.664 --> 01:59:33.167
clearly impossible.

2106
01:59:33.250 --> 01:59:35.753
They tried to tell him, and he just...

2107
01:59:35.836 --> 01:59:39.548
He got violent. He tried to brain one of
the orderlies with this goddamned thing.

2108
01:59:39.631 --> 01:59:42.176
You people know the boy has
a discipline problem.

2109
01:59:42.259 --> 01:59:45.220
Paul, the Clotfelters want
to withdraw Angus from Barton

2110
01:59:45.304 --> 01:59:48.599
and enroll him
at Fork Union Military Academy.

2111
01:59:48.682 --> 01:59:51.018
[Stanley] Set him straight
once and for all.

2112
01:59:51.101 --> 01:59:53.437
He could do a lot worse
than a career in the military.

2113
01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:55.189
Stanley.

2114
01:59:55.272 --> 02:00:00.569
Look, Angus has defied me lots of times
about a lot of things, including this.

2115
02:00:00.652 --> 02:00:02.946
So, however he manipulated
your sympathies

2116
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:06.909
or slipped the leash, just tell us.

2117
02:00:21.131 --> 02:00:23.175
It was my idea.

2118
02:00:27.471 --> 02:00:31.892
No, uh, he didn't, uh,
trick me or slip the leash.

2119
02:00:31.975 --> 02:00:34.019
No, I took him to see his father.

2120
02:00:35.229 --> 02:00:38.065
In fact, I convinced him to do so.

2121
02:00:42.152 --> 02:00:45.697
This is a family matter,
and you had no right to interfere.

2122
02:00:45.781 --> 02:00:47.449
- I don't give a shit.
- [Judy gasps] What?

2123
02:00:47.533 --> 02:00:49.743
- [Dr. Woodrup] Hunham.
- I said I don't give a shit.

2124
02:00:49.827 --> 02:00:52.079
You two were unreachable.

2125
02:00:52.162 --> 02:00:54.123
He was all alone at Christmas.

2126
02:00:54.206 --> 02:00:57.376
I thought the kid should see his father.

2127
02:00:59.795 --> 02:01:01.547
Do you understand
what you've done?

2128
02:01:02.673 --> 02:01:04.591
I have to move Tom now.

2129
02:01:04.675 --> 02:01:07.511
It was hard even finding
a facility that would take him,

2130
02:01:07.594 --> 02:01:11.140
and now I have to move him.

2131
02:01:11.223 --> 02:01:14.059
And that is deeply unfortunate,

2132
02:01:14.143 --> 02:01:18.397
but why compound the misery
by ruining the boy?

2133
02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:22.359
I have just spent
two solid weeks with him.

2134
02:01:22.443 --> 02:01:26.447
He is a pain in the ass, sure,
but he's also very smart.

2135
02:01:26.530 --> 02:01:29.575
Brilliant, I don't know, but very smart.

2136
02:01:30.075 --> 02:01:31.410
You must know that.

2137
02:01:32.244 --> 02:01:34.413
He's got enormous potential.

2138
02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:39.334
It would be devastating
if you pulled him out now.

2139
02:01:43.630 --> 02:01:45.507
[door opens]

2140
02:01:53.056 --> 02:01:55.642
You did this to yourself,
Hunham, not me.

2141
02:01:56.518 --> 02:01:58.729
- I want you to remember that.
- Mmm.

2142
02:02:00.689 --> 02:02:03.859
Hardy, I have known you
since you were a boy,

2143
02:02:03.942 --> 02:02:06.236
so I think I have
the requisite experience

2144
02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:09.948
and insight to aver that
you are and always have been

2145
02:02:11.033 --> 02:02:13.911
penis cancer in human form.

2146
02:02:23.253 --> 02:02:25.005
[sighs]

2147
02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:41.438
It's this one.

2148
02:02:43.065 --> 02:02:45.067
This is the one you should look at.

2149
02:02:55.869 --> 02:02:57.663
Angus, step inside, please.

2150
02:02:58.372 --> 02:03:01.375
["Ombra mai fu" playing]

2151
02:03:17.224 --> 02:03:19.226
[knocks on door]

2152
02:03:30.237 --> 02:03:31.655
- Oh.
- Hello.

2153
02:03:31.738 --> 02:03:33.115
Hello.

2154
02:03:33.198 --> 02:03:35.200
I missed you at breakfast.

2155
02:03:35.284 --> 02:03:37.536
I was, uh... I was busy.

2156
02:03:40.998 --> 02:03:43.542
So did you decide
where you're going to go?

2157
02:03:44.418 --> 02:03:45.460
Yes and no.

2158
02:03:45.544 --> 02:03:50.257
Um, first, I'm going to stash my stuff
at a friend's in Syracuse, and then...

2159
02:03:51.550 --> 02:03:52.759
I don't know.

2160
02:03:52.843 --> 02:03:55.304
Maybe I'll start in Carthage. [chuckles]

2161
02:03:56.221 --> 02:03:58.056
I was hoping you were
going to say that.

2162
02:03:58.140 --> 02:03:59.141
Mmm.

2163
02:04:03.186 --> 02:04:05.480
[sighs]

2164
02:04:11.111 --> 02:04:12.446
For your monograph.

2165
02:04:14.906 --> 02:04:18.619
I don't know, Mary.
There's a lot of empty pages in here.

2166
02:04:18.702 --> 02:04:21.163
- Yeah, well, that's your problem, man.
- [chuckles]

2167
02:04:21.246 --> 02:04:23.999
All you got to do
is write one word after another.

2168
02:04:24.082 --> 02:04:25.417
Can't be that hard, can it?

2169
02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:26.585
- Oh...
- [laughs]

2170
02:04:26.668 --> 02:04:28.503
[chuckles]

2171
02:04:31.298 --> 02:04:33.050
What about you?

2172
02:04:33.133 --> 02:04:35.218
What about me what?

2173
02:04:35.302 --> 02:04:38.263
Oh, no, I'm not going anywhere.
Mm-mmm.

2174
02:04:38.347 --> 02:04:40.474
I'm not like you.
I like having a job.

2175
02:04:40.557 --> 02:04:41.850
[chuckles]

2176
02:04:41.933 --> 02:04:43.852
Plus, I'm saving up for college.

2177
02:04:43.935 --> 02:04:45.771
My sister's baby.

2178
02:04:46.855 --> 02:04:48.690
Ah. [chuckles]

2179
02:04:50.233 --> 02:04:51.818
What is the word from Penny?

2180
02:04:51.902 --> 02:04:53.820
- Peggy.
- Peggy.

2181
02:04:55.364 --> 02:04:57.324
Only that if it's a boy...

2182
02:04:58.825 --> 02:05:01.244
his middle name is going
to be Curtis.

2183
02:05:09.336 --> 02:05:10.545
[sighs]

2184
02:05:14.341 --> 02:05:17.344
[whistle blowing in distance]

2185
02:05:22.099 --> 02:05:24.393
[Kountze] I heard he got booted
for eating feces.

2186
02:05:25.352 --> 02:05:26.353
What?

2187
02:05:26.436 --> 02:05:27.979
Apparently he got caught
in the locker room.

2188
02:05:28.063 --> 02:05:30.357
Hand in the commode,
burgling turds.

2189
02:05:31.650 --> 02:05:33.402
That's not what I heard.

2190
02:05:33.485 --> 02:05:35.404
What did you hear?

2191
02:05:35.487 --> 02:05:37.114
Doesn't matter.

2192
02:05:37.197 --> 02:05:38.949
Either way, he's history.

2193
02:05:39.032 --> 02:05:42.160
Fucker taught history, now is history.

2194
02:05:42.244 --> 02:05:43.995
Right, Tully?

2195
02:05:46.957 --> 02:05:49.501
[sniffs, sighs]

2196
02:05:52.963 --> 02:05:54.089
Hi.

2197
02:05:54.172 --> 02:05:56.091
Oh, hi.

2198
02:05:58.844 --> 02:05:59.845
Look, uh...

2199
02:06:00.804 --> 02:06:04.015
I don't know what you said
to my mom and Stanley, Woodrup...

2200
02:06:06.059 --> 02:06:08.353
but all I know is
I'm not getting kicked out

2201
02:06:08.437 --> 02:06:10.647
and, uh, you got fired.

2202
02:06:11.481 --> 02:06:13.608
Well, I just told the truth.

2203
02:06:14.401 --> 02:06:15.819
Mostly.

2204
02:06:16.611 --> 02:06:17.821
Barton man.

2205
02:06:18.822 --> 02:06:20.824
Barton man.

2206
02:06:24.119 --> 02:06:26.955
[school bell ringing]

2207
02:06:27.038 --> 02:06:28.623
Fifth period.

2208
02:06:37.299 --> 02:06:40.135
You know, it's, uh... it's only PE.

2209
02:06:40.218 --> 02:06:41.720
- [chuckles]
- Maybe I could skip.

2210
02:06:41.803 --> 02:06:43.221
We could head over
to The Winning Ticket.

2211
02:06:43.305 --> 02:06:44.931
- [chuckles]
- Grab a burger and a beer.

2212
02:06:45.015 --> 02:06:48.101
Ah. Miller High Life, no doubt.

2213
02:06:48.185 --> 02:06:50.395
You never give up, do you?

2214
02:06:50.479 --> 02:06:53.732
Well, they already fired you,
so I figured it was worth a shot.

2215
02:06:53.815 --> 02:06:57.486
Your logic is flawless, but, uh, no.

2216
02:07:05.702 --> 02:07:08.163
Keep your head up, all right?

2217
02:07:13.043 --> 02:07:15.212
You can do this.

2218
02:07:16.797 --> 02:07:18.924
Yeah, I was gonna tell you
the same thing.

2219
02:07:33.897 --> 02:07:35.315
