- How?
- Throw out the old act.

33

- Connecticut?
- What you got to do is,
you gotta go over to Grand Central.

161
00:10:49.306 --> 00:10:52.570
Then you got to take
the Metro-North train... north?

162
00:10:52.642 --> 00:10:56.874
So one could take the train?
Just hypothetically.

Connecticut have to offer us?

No, no, no.

that you don't know anything

[man whimpering]

310
00:20:17.015 --> 00:20:20.348
- [groans] Knicks lost again.
- What are you going to do.

311
00:20:20.418 --> 00:20:23.876
Did that say "Grand Central
Station" or "my aunt's constipation"?

312
00:20:23.955 --> 00:20:24.944
This is it!

313
00:20:27.025 --> 00:20:29.459
Grand Central Station.

314
00:20:29.527 --> 00:20:32.963
It's grand and it's central.

00:20:34.945 --> 00:20:36.333
[tires screeching]

00:20:43.967 --> 00:20:46.456
-[Melman groaning]
-[clang]

315
00:20:50.581 --> 00:20:52.390
-[people screaming]
-[Alex] Move aside. Emergency here.

316
00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:58.485
This is an emergency situation.
Hey, hey. Just chill out. Not that big.

317
00:20:58.554 --> 00:20:59.987
Upstairs, you downstairs!

318
00:21:00.656 --> 00:21:02.457
-How do you like that?!
-[yells]

319
00:21:04.394 --> 00:21:07.326
-Lady! What is wrong with you?!
-[lady grunts]

320
00:21:07.397 --> 00:21:09.888
Ow! Get a grip on yourselves, people.

321
00:21:09.966 --> 00:21:11.456
You're a bad kitty.

322
00:21:13.236 --> 00:21:16.171
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.

323
00:21:16.239 --> 00:21:19.140
Looks like I'll have
to take the Stamford local.

324
00:21:19.208 --> 00:21:20.970
[Alex] I got him! I've got him!

325
00:21:21.043 --> 00:21:22.135
He's got him!

326
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.440
He's got him!
He's got him! He's got...

327
00:21:24.513 --> 00:21:25.946
[lady] I got something for you!

00:21:26.012 --> 00:21:29.712
-[Melman exclaiming]
-[clock crashing]

328
00:21:29.785 --> 00:21:31.047
I'm okay. I'm okay.

329
00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:33.587
Whoa! What are
you guys doing here?

330
00:21:33.655 --> 00:21:37.421
- [sighs] I am so glad we found you.
- We were so worried about you.

331
00:21:37.492 --> 00:21:40.893
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look at me. I'm fine.

332
00:21:40.962 --> 00:21:44.021
You're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.

333
00:21:44.098 --> 00:21:46.828
You hear that? Marty's fine.
That's good to know.

334
00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:48.528
Because I was wondering, uh...

335
00:21:48.602 --> 00:21:51.662
How could you do this to us?!
I thought we were your friends!

336
00:21:51.739 --> 00:21:54.003
What's the big deal?!
I was coming back in the morning!

337
00:21:54.075 --> 00:21:56.202
Don't you ever do this again.
Do you hear me?

338
00:21:56.277 --> 00:21:59.007
- Do you hear him?
- Guys, we're running out of time.

339
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.945
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock?

340
00:22:01.015 --> 00:22:04.451
...do this again! Don't you ever,
ever do this again!

341
00:22:04.785 --> 00:22:05.979
Come here. [grunts]

00:22:08.122 --> 00:22:12.013
[officers shouting]

342
00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:14.855
We've been ratted out, boys.

343
00:22:14.928 --> 00:22:17.452
-Hold your fire!
-[guns cocking]

344
00:22:22.802 --> 00:22:25.498
[Skipper] Cute and cuddly, boys.
Cute and cuddly.

00:22:28.085 --> 00:22:29.322
[guns cocking]

345
00:22:29.375 --> 00:22:31.808
If you have any poo, fling it now.

346
00:22:34.146 --> 00:22:36.046
[Marty whispering]
It's the Man.

347
00:22:37.616 --> 00:22:39.243
Good evening, officers.

348
00:22:39.318 --> 00:22:41.479
No. No. No. You don't talk now. Okay?

349
00:22:41.553 --> 00:22:44.113
You're not good with the
"putting words together

350
00:22:44.189 --> 00:22:46.919
and their coming out good" thing.
You keep it "shh."

351
00:22:46.992 --> 00:22:50.484
Hey! How you doing?
You know what? Everything's cool.

352
00:22:50.562 --> 00:22:54.429
We just had a little situation here.
Little internal situation.

353
00:22:54.499 --> 00:22:57.468
My friend went a little crazy.
Happens to everybody.

354
00:22:57.535 --> 00:23:00.595
The city gets to us all.
Went a little cuckoo in the head.

355
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:02.605
Don't be calling me
cuckoo in the head.

356
00:23:02.673 --> 00:23:06.541
Just shush! I will handle this.

357
00:23:06.611 --> 00:23:07.873
-[groans]
-I got him!

358
00:23:07.945 --> 00:23:09.879
Go, go, go! Right here, please.

359
00:23:09.947 --> 00:23:13.490
Would you give a guy a break?
[groans]

360
00:23:13.584 --> 00:23:17.713
We'll take my little friend home and
forget this ever happened. All right?

361
00:23:18.822 --> 00:23:21.188
-No harm, no foul, right?
-[gasping]

362
00:23:21.258 --> 00:23:25.661
Hey, it's cool. It's me,
Alex the lion. From the zoo.

00:23:25.733 --> 00:23:28.943
[growling]

363
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.000
What's the matter with them?

00:23:32.733 --> 00:23:34.344
[groans] Ow.

364
00:23:40.437 --> 00:23:45.340
Wow. [sighs]
I feel really, really weird.

365
00:23:45.416 --> 00:23:48.883
Hey. Oh...I love you guys.

366
00:23:49.885 --> 00:23:52.683
[deeply] I love you so much.

00:23:52.733 --> 00:23:55.344
[upbeat music plays]

00:24:07.653 --> 00:24:09.344
[glass breaks]

367
00:24:13.274 --> 00:24:16.175
[woman] Last night's dramatic 
incident in Grand Central

368
00:24:16.243 --> 00:24:20.111
is an example of what animal rights
wackos have been shouting for years:

369
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.206
Animals clearly
don't belong in captivity.

370
00:24:23.284 --> 00:24:26.276
They are to be sent back
to their natural habitat,

371
00:24:26.353 --> 00:24:29.844
where they will live their lives
in the freedom they desire.

372
00:24:29.923 --> 00:24:32.915
- [Alex] Hey. Little help?
- He's awake! He's awake!

373
00:24:33.326 --> 00:24:34.816
-[people screaming]
-[dart pops]

374
00:24:35.595 --> 00:24:38.532
-Oh, man.
-[music plays faster]

00:24:47.411 --> 00:24:49.244
[Alex groans]

375
00:24:49.275 --> 00:24:52.798
-Oh, my head. [groaning]
-[thud]

376
00:24:53.412 --> 00:24:54.777
What the...?

377
00:24:54.846 --> 00:24:57.280
Wait. Where? What?

378
00:24:58.083 --> 00:25:01.780
I'm in a box! Oh, no.
No, no! Not the box.

379
00:25:01.853 --> 00:25:05.448
Oh, no, they can't
transfer me. Not me!

380
00:25:05.524 --> 00:25:08.516
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

381
00:25:08.593 --> 00:25:10.561
Darkness creeping in?

382
00:25:10.629 --> 00:25:12.893
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

383
00:25:12.965 --> 00:25:15.091
Walls closing in around me.

384
00:25:15.112 --> 00:25:18.460
[panting]
So alone. So alone.

385
00:25:18.536 --> 00:25:21.471
- [Marty] Alex! Alex, are you there?
- Marty?

386
00:25:21.539 --> 00:25:24.804
- Yeah! Talk to me, buddy.
- Oh, Marty! You're here!

387
00:25:24.875 --> 00:25:27.708
- What's going on? You okay?
- This doesn't look good.

388
00:25:27.778 --> 00:25:29.837
- [Gloria] Alex, Marty, is that you?
- Gloria!

389
00:25:29.914 --> 00:25:33.042
- You're here too!
- I am loving the sound of your voice.

390
00:25:33.117 --> 00:25:35.381
- What is going on?
- We're all in crates.

391
00:25:35.453 --> 00:25:36.579
-Oh, no!
-[Melman groans]

392
00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.287
- Sleeping just knocks me out.
- Melman!

393
00:25:40.357 --> 00:25:41.449
Is that Melman?

394
00:25:41.524 --> 00:25:44.254
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

395
00:25:44.327 --> 00:25:47.160
I often doze off
while I'm getting an MRI.

396
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:50.063
- Melman, you're not getting an MRI.
- CAT scan?

397
00:25:50.133 --> 00:25:53.000
No CAT scan. It's a transfer.
It's a zoo transfer.

398
00:25:53.069 --> 00:25:56.527
Zoo transfer?! Oh, no.
No, I can't be transferred.

399
00:25:56.606 --> 00:25:59.200
I have an appointment
with Dr. Goldberg at 5:00.

400
00:25:59.275 --> 00:26:01.936
There are prescriptions
that have to be filled.

401
00:26:02.011 --> 00:26:04.605
No other zoo could
afford my medical care.

402
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.272
-Calm down, Melman.
-And I am not going HMO.

403
00:26:06.348 --> 00:26:12.011
Easy, Melman. It's gonna be okay.
We are going to be okizay.

404
00:26:09.184 --> 00:26:15.983
No, Marty, we're not gonna be okizay.
Because of you, we're ruined!

406
00:26:16.058 --> 00:26:19.585
Because of me? I fail
to see how this is my fault.

407
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:23.062
- [sighs] You're kidding, right, Marty?
- You. You ticked off the people.

408
00:26:23.132 --> 00:26:25.656
You bit the hand, Marty.
You bit the hand.

409
00:26:25.733 --> 00:26:30.261
"I don't know who I am. I got to go
find myself in the wild." Oh, please.

410
00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:33.569
Hey, hey! I did not ask you
to come after me, did I?

411
00:26:33.641 --> 00:26:35.302
-He does have a point.
-What?

412
00:26:35.376 --> 00:26:38.470
I did say we should stay at the zoo,
but you guys...

413
00:26:38.546 --> 00:26:39.672
[Alex] Melman, just shut it.

414
00:26:39.747 --> 00:26:42.409
You suggested this idea
to him in the first place.

415
00:26:42.483 --> 00:26:44.951
- [Gloria] Leave Melman out of this.
- [Melman] Thank you, Gloria.

416
00:26:45.119 --> 00:26:47.882
Besides, it's not my fault
that we were transferred.

417
00:26:47.954 --> 00:26:50.718
[Gloria] Melman, shut it.
Does anybody feel nauseous?

418
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:54.625
- [Melman] I feel nauseous.
- [Alex] Melman, you always feel nauseous.

00:26:54.734 --> 00:26:59.455

Progress report.

420
00:27:01.535 --> 00:27:04.698
It's an older code, Skipper.
I can't make it out.

421
00:27:04.771 --> 00:27:06.898
-You, higher mammal.
-Hmm?

422
00:27:06.973 --> 00:27:08.406
Can you read?

423
00:27:08.475 --> 00:27:12.817
-No. Phil can read, though. Phil?
-[cans clattering]

Africa!

427
00:27:22.922 --> 00:27:26.085
Africa? That ain't going to fly. Rico.

-[mug shattering]

428
00:28:08.665 --> 00:28:11.327
I was the star
in the greatest city on Earth.

429
00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:13.869
- [Gloria] Guys, listen.
- A king. Loved by my people.

430
00:28:13.937 --> 00:28:16.633
- Let's just be civil.
- And you've ruined everything!

431
00:28:16.707 --> 00:28:17.799
"Loved"?

432
00:28:17.875 --> 00:28:22.106
If the people loved you, it's only
because they didn't know the real you!

433
00:28:22.178 --> 00:28:25.238
Don't make me come up there.
I'll whoop both of y'all.

434
00:28:25.314 --> 00:28:26.804
I thought I knew the real you!

435
00:28:26.883 --> 00:28:31.786
Your black-and-white stripes, they
cancel each other out. You're nothing!

436
00:28:31.854 --> 00:28:33.481
[Melman] Stop it, stop it, stop it!

437
00:28:33.556 --> 00:28:35.683
[Gloria] You're not helping the situation.

438
00:28:36.259 --> 00:28:37.521
Status.

439
00:28:37.593 --> 00:28:40.824
It's no good, Skipper.
I don't know the codes.

440
00:28:40.897 --> 00:28:44.627
Don't give me excuses,
give me results! Navigation.

441
00:28:47.969 --> 00:28:50.369
-All right. Let me think.
-[man mumbling]

442
00:28:50.438 --> 00:28:52.065
And shut him up!

[beeps]

443
00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.543

00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:33.849
-There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!
-[Alex] Stop it!

613
00:39:33.921 --> 00:39:37.219
- Enough! Enough with the stick.
- I think she got it.

614
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.724
Is it still on me? I hate spiders.

615
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.957
It's okay. It's gone.

616
00:39:42.028 --> 00:39:44.588
They are savages.

617
00:39:44.664 --> 00:39:45.892
Tonight we die.

618
00:39:45.965 --> 00:39:49.059
[stammering] The feet! I told you...
I told you to... I told every...

619
00:39:49.135 --> 00:39:51.035
Didn't I tell him about the feet?

620
00:39:51.671 --> 00:39:55.265
-He did tell you about the feet.
-[chuckles nervously]

621
00:39:55.708 --> 00:39:58.768
- Wait. I have a plan.
- Really?

622
00:39:58.845 --> 00:40:01.210
I have devised a cunning test

623
00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.011
to see whether
these are savage killers.

624
00:40:10.823 --> 00:40:12.586
Hi there.

625
00:40:12.658 --> 00:40:17.152
You let me handle it.
Alex handles it. Marty does nothing.

626
00:40:21.466 --> 00:40:24.234
Hi there.

00:40:24.344 --> 00:40:26.734
[sobbing]

627
00:40:26.838 --> 00:40:29.136
Oh, geez. Oh! Oh, sorry.

628
00:40:29.207 --> 00:40:32.571
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do?
- No, no, no. Stop, stop.

629
00:40:32.614 --> 00:40:35.857
It's OK.  It's OK.
I'm just a silly... just a silly lion.

00:40:36.012 --> 00:40:37.876
-[wailing]
-Oh, geez!

630
00:40:40.718 --> 00:40:43.312
- Aw, Alex!
- Oh, you poor little baby.

631
00:40:43.387 --> 00:40:46.015
-Did that big mean lion scare you?
-Mm-hmm.

632
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:50.526
He did? He's a big,
bad old puddy tat, isn't he?

633
00:40:50.594 --> 00:40:53.757
Come on. Mama'll hold you.
Aww, look at you.

634
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:56.128
[Melman] They are so cute
from a reasonable distance.

635
00:40:56.199 --> 00:40:58.136
-Aren't you the sweetest little thing.
-[laughing]

00:40:58.177 --> 00:41:00.654
I just want to dunk him in my coffee.

636
00:41:00.704 --> 00:41:03.605
They are just a bunch of pansies.

637
00:41:03.673 --> 00:41:05.004
I don't know.

638
00:41:05.075 --> 00:41:07.976
There's something
about that one with the crazy hairdo

639
00:41:08.044 --> 00:41:10.170
that I find suspicious.

640
00:41:10.246 --> 00:41:11.804
Nonsense, Maurice.

641
00:41:11.881 --> 00:41:15.942
Come on, everybody.
Let's go and meet the pansies!

00:41:16.013 --> 00:41:18.211
[cheering]

00:41:23.045 --> 00:41:27.677
[horn blowing]

642
00:41:27.529 --> 00:41:31.124
Presenting your royal highness,
our illustrious King Julien Xlll,

643
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.828
self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs,
et cetera. Hooray, everybody.

644
00:41:41.709 --> 00:41:43.199
He's got style.

00:41:43.344 --> 00:41:45.565
[whooping]

645
00:41:50.051 --> 00:41:52.542
What is he, like,
king of the guinea pigs?

646
00:41:54.555 --> 00:41:56.022
I think it's a squirrel.

647
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.252
Welcome, giant pansies.

648
00:41:59.326 --> 00:42:02.090
Please feel free to bask in my glow.

649
00:42:02.162 --> 00:42:04.596
- Definitely a squirrel.
- Yep, squirrel.

650
00:42:04.665 --> 00:42:08.999
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the fossa.

651
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:11.128
- The whossa?
- The fossa.

652
00:42:11.271 --> 00:42:15.207
They annoy us by trespassing,
interrupting our parties

653
00:42:15.275 --> 00:42:17.209
- and ripping our limbs off.
- Good.

654
00:42:17.277 --> 00:42:20.268
We're just trying to find out
where the people are, so...

655
00:42:20.346 --> 00:42:22.473
Oh, my. 
What big teeth you have. Man!

656
00:42:22.548 --> 00:42:26.814
Shame on you, Maurice. Do you not
see that you have insulted the freak?

657
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.945
[laughs] You must tell me,
who the heck are you?

658
00:42:30.022 --> 00:42:34.118
I'm Alex. The Alex.
And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.

659
00:42:34.193 --> 00:42:37.458
And just where are you giants from, hmm?

660
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:39.623
We're from New York and...

661
00:42:40.199 --> 00:42:42.394
All hail the New York Giants!

662
00:42:42.468 --> 00:42:46.731
[all] New York Giants!
[cheering, shouting]

663
00:42:47.005 --> 00:42:49.269
Is this some sort of
inbreeding program?

664
00:42:49.341 --> 00:42:52.435
I say we just got to ask these
bozos where the people are.

665
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:55.843
[King Julien] Excuse me. We bozos
have the people, of course.

666
00:42:56.414 --> 00:42:58.974
Hey, the bozos have the people.

667
00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:02.577
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.

668
00:43:02.654 --> 00:43:04.087
They're up there.

669
00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:11.955
Don't you love the people?
Not a very lively bunch, though.

670
00:43:12.029 --> 00:43:13.121
Oh, wow.

671
00:43:13.197 --> 00:43:15.961
Do you have any live people?

672
00:43:16.001 --> 00:43:18.832
Uh, no. Only dead ones.

673
00:43:18.902 --> 00:43:21.871
I mean, if we had
a lot of live people here,

674
00:43:21.939 --> 00:43:25.500
it wouldn't be called
the wild, would it? [chuckling]

675
00:43:25.576 --> 00:43:26.873
The wild?

676
00:43:26.944 --> 00:43:30.038
Whoa. Hold up there
a second, fuzzbucket.

677
00:43:30.114 --> 00:43:31.444
You mean, like,

678
00:43:31.614 --> 00:43:36.108
the "live in a mud hut, wipe
yourself with a leaf" type wild?

679
00:43:36.185 --> 00:43:38.779
- Who wipes? [chuckles]
- Oy vey.

680
00:43:38.855 --> 00:43:40.584
- Oy vey!
- Oy vey, everybody!

681
00:43:40.656 --> 00:43:42.590
[all] Oy vey!

682
00:43:42.658 --> 00:43:45.024
Could you excuse me
for a moment?

00:43:45.123 --> 00:43:48.123
[gasping, whimpering]

683
00:43:49.432 --> 00:43:52.697
Get me out of here!
We got to get out of here!

684
00:43:52.935 --> 00:43:55.630
- Help!
- What are you doing?!

685
00:43:55.704 --> 00:43:57.831
-I'm swimming back to New York.
-[Marty singing]

686
00:43:57.906 --> 00:44:00.898
I know my chances are slim,
but I have to try!

687
00:44:00.976 --> 00:44:04.537
- You can't swim!
- I said my chances are slim!

688
00:44:04.613 --> 00:44:09.448
[Melman] Nature! It's all over me!
Get it off! I can't see! I can't see!

689
00:44:11.153 --> 00:44:14.000
I can see! [shrieking]

690
00:44:14.056 --> 00:44:17.354
OK, look. There's obviously
just been a little mistake.

691
00:44:17.425 --> 00:44:19.985
The people didn't
dump us here on purpose.

692
00:44:20.061 --> 00:44:24.259
As soon as they realize what happened,
they'll come looking for us, right?

693
00:44:24.331 --> 00:44:25.457
Yeah, right.

694
00:44:25.533 --> 00:44:29.560
[Marty] ♪ I don't know the words
But we're born free ♪

695
00:44:29.637 --> 00:44:33.198
You know something?
I bet they're already on their way.

00:44:33.432 --> 00:44:37.444
-[gasps]
-[ship's horn blows]

696
00:44:39.513 --> 00:44:44.074
Well, boys, it's going
to be ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

697
00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.553
Rico.

698
00:44:51.291 --> 00:44:55.352
[Melman] Well, since I'm doomed
to die on this forsaken island,

699
00:44:55.428 --> 00:44:57.726
I, Melman Mankiewicz,

700
00:44:57.797 --> 00:45:01.164
being of sound mind
and unsound body,

701
00:45:01.234 --> 00:45:05.431
have divided my estate
equally among the three of you.

702
00:45:05.772 --> 00:45:07.932
[groans] Sorry, Alex.

703
00:45:08.006 --> 00:45:12.670
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman.
Outdoor plumbing.

704
00:45:12.744 --> 00:45:14.644
No, it's not a latrine.

705
00:45:14.713 --> 00:45:18.979
It's a grave. You sent Melman
to his grave. Are you happy?

706
00:45:19.051 --> 00:45:20.382
Aw, come on.

707
00:45:20.452 --> 00:45:23.888
This isn't the end.
This is a whole new beginning.

708
00:45:23.956 --> 00:45:26.220
This could be the best that's happened.

709
00:45:26.291 --> 00:45:28.315
No. No. No. No.

710
00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:32.886
No. No. No. No. No. No. This is not
the best thing that's happened to us.

711
00:45:32.964 --> 00:45:36.866
You abused the power of the birthday
wish and brought bad luck on all of us.

712
00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:39.528
Why'd you tell us your wish?
You're not supposed to do that.

713
00:45:39.604 --> 00:45:42.232
Wait a minute.
I didn't want to tell you. Remember?

714
00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:45.798
- You guys made me tell you.
- Oh, okay.

715
00:45:45.877 --> 00:45:49.540
Besides, this isn't bad luck.
This is good luck.

716
00:45:49.614 --> 00:45:52.446
Look around. There's no fences,
no schedules.

717
00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:54.984
This place is beautiful.
Baby, we were born...

718
00:45:55.051 --> 00:45:57.576
OK, OK, I've had enough of this.

719
00:45:57.654 --> 00:46:02.591
This is your side of the island,
and this is our side of the island.

720
00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:05.355
That is the bad side,
where you can prance and skip

721
00:46:05.428 --> 00:46:08.920
like a magical pixie horse, do whatever 
the heck you want to do all day long.

722
00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:12.958
And this is the good side for those who
love New York and care about going home.

723
00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:15.799
- Come on.
- No, no. Back! Back!

724
00:46:15.871 --> 00:46:17.634
[Gloria] You know what? This isn't good.

725
00:46:17.706 --> 00:46:22.040
Okay! You all have your side,
and I'll have mine.

726
00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:24.978
And if you need me,
I'll be over here,

727
00:46:25.047 --> 00:46:28.983
on the fun side of the island,
having a good old time.

728
00:46:29.051 --> 00:46:30.575
That's not the fun side.
This is the fun side!

729
00:46:30.653 --> 00:46:33.952
This is the fun side where we'll have 
a great time surviving until we go home!

730
00:46:34.023 --> 00:46:36.753
- A yabbadabbado old time!
- I love this side, this side's the best.

731
00:46:36.824 --> 00:46:40.351
That side stinks! You're on
the Jersey side of this cesspool!

732
00:46:40.428 --> 00:46:42.658
- [Marty] Wilma!
- Well, now what do we do?

733
00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:45.164
Don't worry. I have
a plan to get us rescued.

734
00:46:47.402 --> 00:46:51.395
Can't wait to see the look
on Marty's face when he sees this.

735
00:46:54.809 --> 00:46:58.301
Hoo-hoo-hoo, just look at him.
He's helpless without us.

736
00:47:07.788 --> 00:47:09.449
Shut up, Spalding.

737
00:47:14.561 --> 00:47:17.621
[Gloria] I've been standing
here for hours, man.

738
00:47:17.698 --> 00:47:20.360
How long do I have
to pose like this?

739
00:47:21.134 --> 00:47:23.567
She is finito!

740
00:47:24.403 --> 00:47:28.271
I defy any rescue boat
within a million miles

741
00:47:28.341 --> 00:47:30.400
to miss this baby.

742
00:47:30.476 --> 00:47:34.674
When the moment is right,
we will ignite the beacon of liberty

743
00:47:34.747 --> 00:47:38.478
and be rescued
from this awful nightmare!

744
00:47:38.551 --> 00:47:41.543
What do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

745
00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:44.647
- How's the liberty fire going, Melman?
- Great. Idiot.

746
00:47:44.724 --> 00:47:46.214
I heard that.

747
00:47:46.292 --> 00:47:48.885
Why can't we just borrow
some of Marty's fire?

748
00:47:50.195 --> 00:47:54.188
That's wild fire. We're not
using wild fire on Lady Liberty.

749
00:47:54.266 --> 00:47:57.133
- Now, rub, Melman.
- I've been doing...

750
00:47:57.202 --> 00:48:01.798
I can't. I can't.
I can't do it. I ju... I can't do it!

751
00:48:01.894 --> 00:48:04.266
-[fire whooshes]
-Fire.

752
00:48:05.477 --> 00:48:06.466
Fire.

Fire! Fire!

Oh, my...[gasps]

-Fire! [screaming]
-Not yet! No, no!

00:48:19.023 --> 00:48:20.513
Fire!

You burned it up!

00:48:44.614 --> 00:48:46.445
Darn you!

765
00:48:46.516 --> 00:48:49.383
Darn you all to heck!

766
00:48:49.786 --> 00:48:51.947
Can we go to the fun side now?

[lemurs chattering]

767
00:48:53.256 --> 00:48:56.350
[Maurice] Everybody, calm down.
Come on. Into your chairs.

768
00:48:56.426 --> 00:48:59.223
Everybody, calm down.
Let go of his tail.

769
00:48:59.294 --> 00:49:01.762
Separate those two,
would you, please?

770
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:03.593
You here, you there. Everyone...[shushes]

771
00:49:04.266 --> 00:49:07.167
Calm down, people, okay?

772
00:49:07.235 --> 00:49:11.501
Now, presenting your royal highness,
the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

773
00:49:11.573 --> 00:49:14.736
You know, et cetera, et cetera.
Hooray. Let's go.

774
00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:16.402
Now, everybody,

775
00:49:16.478 --> 00:49:21.176
we all have great curiosity
about our guests, the New York giants.

776
00:49:21.248 --> 00:49:23.148
- Yes, Willie?
- I like them.

777
00:49:23.217 --> 00:49:27.176
I like them. I liked them first.
Before I even met them I liked them.

778
00:49:27.254 --> 00:49:31.020
I liked them right away. You hate
them compared to how much I like them.

779
00:49:31.092 --> 00:49:34.356
-Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!
-[chuckles]

780
00:49:34.495 --> 00:49:37.726
Now, for as long
as we can remember,

781
00:49:37.798 --> 00:49:42.599
we have been attacked
and eaten by the dreaded fossa.

782
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:47.365
-The fossa! The fossa are attacking!
-[all screaming]

783
00:49:47.542 --> 00:49:51.333
-[glass shattering]
-It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

784
00:49:51.411 --> 00:49:53.038
Please. Maurice.

785
00:49:53.114 --> 00:49:55.877
Shh! Quiet!

786
00:49:55.949 --> 00:50:00.113
Come on, y'all. They're not
attacking us this very instant.

00:50:00.768 --> 00:50:01.546
[all sighing]

787
00:50:01.688 --> 00:50:05.021
So my genius plan is this:

788
00:50:05.091 --> 00:50:10.460
We will make the New York giants
our friends and keep them close.

790
00:50:10.529 --> 00:50:13.828
Then, with Mr. Alex protecting us,

791
00:50:13.899 --> 00:50:17.266
we will be safe
and never have to worry

792
00:50:17.336 --> 00:50:23.376
-about the dreaded fossa ever again!
-[all cheering]

793
00:50:23.475 --> 00:50:27.468
I thought of that.
I thought of that. Yes, me, I did.

794
00:50:27.546 --> 00:50:30.275
Hold on, everybody. Hold on.
I'm just thinking now.

795
00:50:30.348 --> 00:50:33.181
I mean, does anyone
wonder why the fossa

796
00:50:33.251 --> 00:50:35.845
were so scared of Mr. Alex?

797
00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.185
I mean,
maybe we should be scared too.

798
00:50:39.257 --> 00:50:42.317
What if Mr. Alex
is even worse than the fossa?

00:50:42.412 --> 00:50:44.344
-[gasping]
-I'm telling you,

799
00:50:44.461 --> 00:50:47.026
that dude just
gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

800
00:50:47.098 --> 00:50:49.589
Maurice, you did not raise your hand.

801
00:50:49.667 --> 00:50:53.397
Therefore, your heinous comment
will be stricken from the record.

802
00:50:55.105 --> 00:50:57.869
Does anyone else
have the heebie-jeebies?

803
00:50:57.941 --> 00:51:00.409
No? Good, so shut up.

804
00:51:00.911 --> 00:51:03.709
When the New York giants wake up,

805
00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:09.446
we will make sure
that they wake up in paradise.

806
00:51:09.821 --> 00:51:13.119
[laughs] Now, who would like a cookie?

00:51:13.233 --> 00:51:15.333
[lemurs cheering]

807
00:51:37.746 --> 00:51:42.614
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria
are over there having a good time.

808
00:51:42.684 --> 00:51:45.244
There's room
on the fun side for one more.

809
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.947
No, thanks.

810
00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:51.185
Look, I've been thinking.
Maybe if you gave this place a chance,

811
00:51:51.259 --> 00:51:54.251
I don't know, you might
even enjoy yourself.

812
00:51:54.329 --> 00:51:57.787
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

813
00:51:57.866 --> 00:51:59.766
I just want to go home.

814
00:52:00.935 --> 00:52:04.927
Could you just give it a chance?
Think about it.

815
00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:08.740
It really isn't
the fun side without you.

00:52:13.987 --> 00:52:16.321
[creaking]

816
00:52:18.758 --> 00:52:26.185
-[guitar playing]
-[laughing]

817
00:52:29.161 --> 00:52:31.254
- [Melman whispers] It's him.
- [Marty] Who is it?

818
00:52:31.764 --> 00:52:35.063
It's the pizza man.
Who the heck do you think it is?

819
00:52:35.401 --> 00:52:37.767
Yes? Can I help you?

820
00:52:38.471 --> 00:52:39.995
Can I come to the fun side?

821
00:52:42.675 --> 00:52:43.733
Beg your pardon?

822
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.740
You know, I've been kind 
of a jerk, Marty.

823
00:52:48.681 --> 00:52:53.413
But I've been thinking
about what you said, and I'm sorry.

00:52:56.234 --> 00:52:58.455
[chains rattling]

824
00:53:00.692 --> 00:53:04.355
Welcome to Casa del Wild!
Take a load off.

825
00:53:04.429 --> 00:53:06.397
Hey, hey, wipe your feet.

826
00:53:11.469 --> 00:53:15.564
- Alex!
- Mi casa is su casa.

827
00:53:22.479 --> 00:53:23.969
Very impressive.

828
00:53:24.048 --> 00:53:27.108
Hey, have a drink. It's on the house.

829
00:53:27.126 --> 00:53:30.148
[slurps, spits] This is seawater.

830
00:53:30.255 --> 00:53:35.055
[spits] Oh, you don't swallow it. It's just
temporary till the plumbing's done.

831
00:53:35.125 --> 00:53:37.058
Hey, y'all look hungry.

832
00:53:37.794 --> 00:53:40.820
How would you like
some of nature's goodness?

833
00:53:41.931 --> 00:53:43.592
[spits] You have food?

834
00:53:43.666 --> 00:53:46.601
The Fun Side Special, coming up.

835
00:53:47.303 --> 00:53:49.328
Seaweed on a stick.

836
00:53:49.906 --> 00:53:50.895
-[spits] Seaweed?
-[spitting]

837
00:53:51.341 --> 00:53:54.401
On a stick.
Don't love it till you try it.

838
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:03.808
[muffled] That's unbelievable.

839
00:54:05.287 --> 00:54:07.346
- So good.
- Well, thanks.

840
00:54:07.422 --> 00:54:10.289
It does kind of hit the spot,
doesn't it?

00:54:10.344 --> 00:54:11.134
[coughing]

841
00:54:11.293 --> 00:54:14.524
Well, maybe it could
use a little lemon.

00:54:14.612 --> 00:54:18.432
[groaning]

842
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:22.800
No, it's great. It's really great.
Doesn't get any better than this.

843
00:54:22.871 --> 00:54:24.633
Oh, but it does.

844
00:54:25.306 --> 00:54:26.830
Check this out.

845
00:54:32.146 --> 00:54:36.105
Wow. Would you look at that.

846
00:54:36.183 --> 00:54:40.677
It's like billions
and billions of helicopters.

847
00:54:40.755 --> 00:54:43.155
It's a shooting star.
Make a wish. Quick!

848
00:54:43.224 --> 00:54:46.387
Ooh! How about a thick, juicy steak?

849
00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.983
[Marty] You know what, Alex?

850
00:54:48.061 --> 00:54:52.725
I promise you I'm going to find you
a steak tomorrow if it kills me.

851
00:54:52.799 --> 00:54:54.096
[Alex] Thanks, Marty.

852
00:54:54.167 --> 00:54:57.227
[Melman] It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...[snores]

853
00:54:57.303 --> 00:55:01.671
[Gloria] I think I'm going to
hit the sack too. Sweet dreams, everyone.

855
00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:33.368
[Marty] Alex.

856
00:55:43.347 --> 00:55:45.076
What are you doing?

857
00:55:45.917 --> 00:55:50.411
27, 28, 29, 30. Hmm.
30 black and only 29 white.

858
00:55:50.488 --> 00:55:53.321
Looks like you're black
with white stripes after all.

859
00:55:53.391 --> 00:55:54.915
Dilemma solved. Good night.

860
00:56:05.635 --> 00:56:09.162
You see, Maurice,
Mr. Alex was grooming his friend.

861
00:56:09.239 --> 00:56:12.675
He is clearly a tender, loving thing.

862
00:56:12.743 --> 00:56:15.678
How can you have the
heebie-jeebies for Mr. Alex?

863
00:56:15.746 --> 00:56:19.409
Look at him.
He's so cute and plushy.

864
00:56:19.483 --> 00:56:22.007
I don't think he was 
grooming him, Julien.

865
00:56:22.084 --> 00:56:24.552
Look more like
he was tasting him to me.

866
00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.953
Suit yourself, no matter.
I don't care.

867
00:56:28.023 --> 00:56:32.187
Soon we will put my
excellent plan to action.

868
00:56:32.261 --> 00:56:38.727
All we have to do is wait
until they are deep in their sleep.

00:56:38.765 --> 00:56:44.347
[crickets chirping]

870
00:56:44.405 --> 00:56:47.340
[Julien] How long is this going to take?!

00:56:48.344 --> 00:56:49.122
[leaves rustling]

00:56:53.012 --> 00:56:58.123
[winter wind howling]

871
00:57:13.767 --> 00:57:15.200
Well, this sucks!

872
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:19.134
[Julien] Wake up, Mr. Alex.

873
00:57:20.274 --> 00:57:22.799
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

874
00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:25.207
Rise and shining.

875
00:57:25.279 --> 00:57:28.476
Wakey-waking, Mr. Alex!

876
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:30.015
-Wake up! Alex!
-[gasps]

877
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:31.778
-You suck your thumb?
-[screams]

878
00:57:34.821 --> 00:57:37.415
[Alex] Where are we?
What the heck is going on?

879
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:39.754
-What is this?
-[Julien] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

880
00:57:39.826 --> 00:57:42.818
- Who built a forest?
- Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

881
00:57:42.895 --> 00:57:44.089
While you were asleep,

882
00:57:44.163 --> 00:57:48.327
we simply took you
to our little corner of heaven.

883
00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:50.665
Welcome to Madagascar.

884
00:57:50.736 --> 00:57:53.296
- Mada-who-ah?
- What?

885
00:57:53.371 --> 00:57:55.737
No, not whooha. Ascar.

886
00:58:03.381 --> 00:58:05.076
Marty. It's...

887
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:07.710
Just like my mural back at the zoo.

888
00:58:07.786 --> 00:58:11.950
Oh, no, fella, that is
the real deal right there.

889
00:58:12.023 --> 00:58:14.082
Look at that, that's not a bad view.

890
00:58:14.159 --> 00:58:18.060
That's the thing that you were always
looking at, but it's actually there.

891
00:58:18.195 --> 00:58:21.596
- That's the real version of...
- Hey, how about once around the park?

892
00:58:21.765 --> 00:58:25.098
Let's get our blood pumping,
lungs breathing this fresh air.

893
00:58:25.169 --> 00:58:26.568
Who's with me?!

894
00:58:26.637 --> 00:58:29.105
Naw. I don't think I could...
You're it!

895
00:58:29.173 --> 00:58:32.765
-Hey! Want to play around?
-[Alex laughs]

896
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:34.204
Got you there!

897
00:58:34.278 --> 00:58:35.643
Come here!

898
00:58:36.013 --> 00:58:37.207
You're it.

899
00:58:37.281 --> 00:58:40.010
Hey, stop that!
Hey, you're crazy!

900
00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:43.177
Okay, Marty, I'm it.

901
00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:45.744
I'm it. I'm it. You win.

902
00:58:45.822 --> 00:58:48.313
Come on, Alex, get in the groove.

903
00:58:48.391 --> 00:58:50.291
I haven't eaten in two days.

904
00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.488
My blood sugar's real low.
I just don't have the energy.

905
00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:55.428
I don't think that's your problem.

906
00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:58.194
First of all, that's not
how you run in the wild.

907
00:58:58.268 --> 00:59:00.236
Let's go, man. 
Put the rubber to the road!

908
00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:02.294
You just have
to let out that inner lion.

909
00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:05.807
- Now, who's the cat?
- Marty, I really don't...

910
00:59:05.874 --> 00:59:09.037
You are, that's who.
Come on! Here we go!

911
00:59:09.111 --> 00:59:11.909
That's it. Let's build up
some steam! You the cat.

912
00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.572
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

913
00:59:13.649 --> 00:59:15.241
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

914
00:59:15.317 --> 00:59:18.912
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

915
00:59:18.987 --> 00:59:23.117
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

916
00:59:24.459 --> 00:59:26.256
I'm the cat!

917
00:59:32.066 --> 00:59:34.533
-Surprise!
-[shrieks]

00:59:34.612 --> 00:59:40.123
[both grunting]

918
00:59:41.042 --> 00:59:42.566
You're it. You're it!

919
00:59:42.643 --> 00:59:44.941
Can't juke the cat. Cat's too quick.

00:59:45.012 --> 00:59:47.824
[exclaiming]

920
00:59:47.915 --> 00:59:53.250
I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye
on the fly from the deli in the sky!

921
00:59:53.254 --> 00:59:57.280
- Rar! Let's go wild!
- Now you're talking!

00:59:58.002 --> 01:00:01.334
[both Tarzan yelling]

922
01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:07.127
Whoo-hoo! Man! I feel different.

923
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.499
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
