1
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.190
I killed Sirius Black!

2
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.610
He's back.

3
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.340
The police are continuing
with the investigation...

4
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.550
...into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.

5
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.430
Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.

6
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.270
The surrounding area remains closed.

7
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.600
The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...

8
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.190
"Harry Potter."

9
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.360
Who's Harry Potter?

10
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.910
Oh, no one.

11
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.830
Bit of a tosser, really.

12
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.000
Funny, that paper of yours.

13
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.790
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

14
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.750
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.

15
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.050
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.

16
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.020
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

17
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.150
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

18
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.610
I like riding around on trains.

19
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.780
Takes my mind off things.

20
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.200
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

21
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.710
The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself.

22
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.420
But now is not the time to tell it.

23
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.170
Take my arm.

24
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.090
Do as I say.

25
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.690
I just Apparated, didn't I?

26
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.020
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.

27
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.820
Most people vomit the first time.

28
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.730
I can't imagine why.

29
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.200
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

30
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.670
Harry, I assume, right about now, you must
be wondering why I brought you here.

31
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.540
Am I right?

32
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.090
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.

33
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.470
Wands out, Harry.

34
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.360
Horace?

35
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.910
Horace?

36
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.470
Merlin's beard!

37
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.930
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

38
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.810
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

39
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.150
It's all in the upholstery. I come by
the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

40
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.980
Dragon's blood.

41
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.530
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, introductions.

42
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.700
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...

43
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.330
...Horace Slughorn.

44
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.990
Horace...

45
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.960
...well, you know who this is.

46
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.830
Harry Potter.

47
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.420
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

48
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.050
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?

49
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.680
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

50
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.600
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.

51
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.100
Do you know what that's like?

52
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.020
You can only say no so many times,
so I never stay anywhere more than a week.

53
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.520
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.

54
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:06.570
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.

55
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.060
That was fun.

56
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.070
- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.

57
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.070
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

58
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.740
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

59
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.210
You're very like your father.

60
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.220
- Except for the eyes. You have your...
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.

61
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.090
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.

62
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.600
Even more impressive
when one considers she was Muggle-born.

63
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.350
One of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.

64
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.560
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.

65
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.940
Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

66
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.900
Right at the front.

67
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.370
All mine. Each and every one.

68
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.620
Ex-students, I mean.

69
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:50.260
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of The Daily Prophet.

70
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.090
Always takes my owl, should I wish to
register an opinion on the news of the day.

71
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.930
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

72
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.560
Free tickets whenever I want them.

73
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.730
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

74
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.980
Ah, yes.

75
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.320
Regulus Black.

76
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.450
You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

77
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.160
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

78
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.530
It's a shame. Talented boy.

79
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:25.000
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.

80
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.080
Horace?

81
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.340
Do you mind if I take this?

82
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.550
- I do love knitting patterns.
- Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?

83
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.850
I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.

84
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.310
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...

85
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.440
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

86
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.610
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.

87
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.940
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

88
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.280
Bye.

89
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.790
All right. I'll do it.

90
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.550
But I want Professor Merrythought's old
office, not the water closet I had before.

91
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.920
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!

92
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.350
They are indeed.

93
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.640
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

94
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.900
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

95
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.480
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

96
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.030
You would be his crowning jewel.

97
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.740
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.

98
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.580
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

99
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:51.790
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

100
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.420
It's all right, sir.
I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.

101
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.260
Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

102
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.430
But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

103
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.260
Both are waiting for you.

104
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.300
Hedwig.

105
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.140
Mum?

106
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.890
Ginny, what is it?

107
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.560
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

108
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.980
- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.

109
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.320
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

110
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.990
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

111
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.280
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

112
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.410
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

113
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.580
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?

114
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.290
- Is that an owl?
- You haven't seen him, have you?

115
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.210
He's wandering about the house.

116
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.130
- Really?
- Really.

117
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.960
Harry!

118
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.890
Harry!

119
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.640
Hello.

120
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.100
What a lovely surprise.

121
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.520
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

122
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.520
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.

123
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.940
But then, what would we do
without him?

124
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.860
Got a bit of toothpaste.

125
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.500
So when did you get here?

126
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.370
A few days ago.

127
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.630
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

128
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.720
Mum sort of lost it last week.

129
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.840
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.

130
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.390
That it's too dangerous.

131
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.390
- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.

132
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.890
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.

133
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.940
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...

134
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.650
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.

135
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.910
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

136
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.780
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

137
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.250
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

138
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.210
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

139
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.960
What is he?

140
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.340
Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.

141
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.230
- Cissy! You can't do this!
- He can't be trusted!

142
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.860
The Dark Lord trusts him.

143
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.610
- The Dark Lord's mistaken.
- Pfft.

144
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.150
Run along, Wormtail.

145
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.650
I know I ought not to be here.

146
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.530
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

147
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.370
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

148
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:56.790
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

149
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.630
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

150
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.960
You?

151
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.340
The Dark Lord told you?

152
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.470
Your sister doubts me.

153
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.350
Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.

154
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.350
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.

155
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.610
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

156
00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.690
I don't doubt you, Severus.

157
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.030
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.

158
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.330
He's just a boy.

159
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.210
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

160
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.500
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

161
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.180
- Severus.
- Swear to it.

162
00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.680
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

163
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.610
It's just empty words.

164
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.980
He'll give it his best effort.

165
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.530
But when it matters most...

166
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.370
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

167
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.460
Coward.

168
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.090
Take out your wand.

169
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.440
Will you...

170
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.650
...Severus Snape...

171
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.730
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

172
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:52.740
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

173
00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.780
I will.

174
00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.830
And will you, to the
best of your ability...

175
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.710
...protect him from harm?

176
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.460
I will.

177
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.050
And if Draco should fail...

178
00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:16.800
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

179
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:21.970
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?

180
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.730
I will.

181
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.510
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!

182
00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:55.720
Nosebleed Nougats!

183
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.970
- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!

184
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.020
- Into the cauldron, handsome.
- Into the cauldron, handsome.

185
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.270
I will have order!

186
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:15.780
I really hate children. I will have order!

187
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.870
- Peruvian instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that.

188
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.160
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

189
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.080
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.

190
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.540
- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.

191
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.040
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.

192
00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.380
Meaning?

193
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:34.670
Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?

194
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.880
It's none of your business.

195
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.680
How much for this?

196
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.220
- Five Galleons.
- Five Galleons.

197
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.520
- How much for me?
- Five Galleons.

198
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:48.890
I'm your brother.

199
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.310
- Ten Galleons.
- Ten Galleons.

200
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.900
Come on, let's go.

201
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.780
Hi, Ron.

202
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.820
Hi.

203
00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:18.090
How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.

204
00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.840
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.

205
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.260
I reckon he's right.

206
00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.640
Oh, no.

207
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.440
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.

208
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.280
Harry?

209
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.080
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy look like
two people who don't want to be followed?

210
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.640
Quibbler.

211
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.980
Quibbler.

212
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.570
He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

213
00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.120
- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.

214
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.870
- What's a Wrackspurt?
- They're invisible creatures.

215
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.210
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

216
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.290
Quibbler.

217
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.510
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

218
00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.390
And who were all those people?

219
00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.680
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.

220
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.770
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.

221
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.440
It's happened. He's one of them.

222
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.110
One of what?

223
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.320
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

224
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.450
You're barking.

225
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.740
What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?

226
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:34.950
Well, then what's he doing in
Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

227
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.000
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

228
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:41.040
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

229
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.800
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

230
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.300
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

231
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.550
I need some air.

232
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.070
Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

233
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.720
- What was that? Blaise?
- Don't know.

234
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.020
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.

235
00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.560
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

236
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.030
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

237
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.200
I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...

238
00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.500
...if I had to continue
for another two years.

239
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.000
What's that supposed to mean?

240
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:05.090
Let's just say I don't think you'll see me
wasting my time in Charms class next year.

241
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.710
Amused, Blaise?

242
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.590
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

243
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.490
You two go on.
I wanna check something.

244
00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.960
Where's Harry?

245
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.080
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.

246
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:04.270
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

247
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.020
Petrificus Totalus.

248
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.700
Oh, yeah...

249
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.410
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.

250
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.090
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.

251
00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.680
Finite.

252
00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.100
- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!

253
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.190
- How'd you know where I was?
- Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

254
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.570
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.

255
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.910
- That's all right.
- It was like being with a friend.

256
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.120
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

257
00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.330
That's nice.

258
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.710
About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.

259
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.710
Right. Names?

260
00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.340
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.

261
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.630
No exceptions, Potter.

262
00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.930
Who are those people?

263
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.390
Aurors. For security.

264
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.010
What's this cane here, then?

265
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.560
- It's not a cane, you cretin.
- It's a walking stick.

266
00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.730
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?

267
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.980
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.

268
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:20.410
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

269
00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.750
Nice face, Potter.

270
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.630
Would you like me to fix it for you?

271
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.590
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...

272
00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.300
...but it's up to you.

273
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.020
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

274
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.890
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?

275
00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.860
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

276
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.320
- Episkey.
- Ah!

277
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.620
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.

278
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.120
Brilliant.

279
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.550
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

280
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.140
Will you stop eating?

281
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.560
Your best friend is missing!

282
00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.980
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

283
00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:38.280
He's covered in blood again.

284
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.700
- Why is it he's always covered in blood?
- Looks like it's his own this time.

285
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.030
Where have you been?

286
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.660
- What happened to your face?
- Later.

287
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.450
What've I missed?

288
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.790
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.

289
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.500
Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?

290
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.050
Very best of evenings to you all.

291
00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.260
Thanks.

292
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.150
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...

293
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.560
...Horace Slughorn.

294
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.320
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

295
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.780
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.

296
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:30.870
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

297
00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.830
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

298
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:34.710
Snape?

299
00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.380
Now, as you know...

300
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:46.220
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

301
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.390
And you have the right to know why.

302
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.770
Once there was a young man,
who, like you...

303
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.390
...sat in this very hall...

304
00:30:55.770 --> 00:31:00.400
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.

305
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.360
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.

306
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.070
His name?

307
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:09.870
Tom Riddle.

308
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.710
Today, of course...

309
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.590
...he's known all over the world
by another name.

310
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:26.970
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

311
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.510
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

312
00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.810
Every day, every hour...

313
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.930
...this very minute, perhaps...

314
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.440
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

315
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:47.610
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

316
00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.780
Just something to think about.

317
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.620
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

318
00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.080
That was cheerful.

319
00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:09.130
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

320
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:14.930
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.

321
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.140
Potter.

322
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.440
Oh, this can't be good.

323
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.110
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

324
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.240
- I had a free period this morning, professor.
- So I noticed.

325
00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.160
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

326
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.000
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

327
00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.420
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

328
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.460
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

329
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:49.220
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T.s students...

330
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.180
...with "Exceeds Expectations."

331
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.350
Brilliant. Um...

332
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.970
- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.

333
00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:01.060
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

334
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.150
I don't wanna take Potions.

335
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.030
There's Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.

336
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.700
Attention to detail in the preparation
is the prerequisite of all planning.

337
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.580
Ah.

338
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.660
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.

339
00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:21.500
Ron Weasley, sir.

340
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.500
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

341
00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.840
- I'm gonna...
- Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

342
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.010
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.

343
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.720
I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.

344
00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:34.590
Get what you want from the cupboard.

345
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.100
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

346
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:42.230
Any ideas what these might be?

347
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.310
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

348
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:54.030
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

349
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.910
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

350
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.210
It's terribly tricky to make.

351
00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.420
And this is Amortentia...

352
00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.000
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

353
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.760
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

354
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.050
For example, I smell...

355
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.850
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

356
00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:23.350
...spearmint toothpaste.

357
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:28.230
Now, Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

358
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.400
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

359
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:40.240
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

360
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.590
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

361
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.670
Oh, yes.

362
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.420
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

363
00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:59.010
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

364
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.680
But it is more commonly referred to as...

365
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:07.150
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

366
00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:10.650
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

367
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.450
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

368
00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.990
At least until the effects wear off.

369
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.660
So this is what I offer each of you today.

370
00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:30.670
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

371
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.420
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

372
00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:38.840
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

373
00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:42.680
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...

374
00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:46.180
...of sufficient quality
to claim this prize.

375
00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.020
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

376
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.690
Let the brewing commence.

377
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.350
How did you do that?

378
00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.060
You crush it. Don't cut it.

379
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.730
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

380
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.730
No, really.

381
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:17.400
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

382
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.110
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

383
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:27.370
So here we are, then, as promised.

384
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.750
One vial of Felix Felicis.

385
00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.960
Congratulations.

386
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.210
Use it well.

387
00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.490
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

388
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.540
How are you?

389
00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.250
I'm fine, sir.

390
00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:12.660
Enjoying your classes?

391
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.960
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

392
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.960
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

393
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:21.800
Do you?

394
00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.590
Definitely.

395
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.430
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

396
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.640
- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...

397
00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:34.440
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

398
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.850
I can't help wondering...

399
00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:41.030
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.

400
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:44.200
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

401
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.160
But enough chitchat.

402
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:50.950
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

403
00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.370
The answer lies here.

404
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.540
What you are looking at are memories.

405
00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:01.550
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

406
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.170
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

407
00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:11.060
This vial contains
the most particular memory...

408
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.430
...of the day I first met him.

409
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.560
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

410
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:59.440
I admit some confusion
upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.

411
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:03.230
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

412
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.150
There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.

413
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:11.740
Tom, you have a visitor.

414
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.950
How do you do, Tom?

415
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.710
Don't.

416
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:33.640
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.

417
00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.850
I am a professor.

418
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.390
I don't believe you.

419
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.560
She wants me looked at.

420
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:43.360
They think I'm different.

421
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.020
Well, perhaps they're right.

422
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.650
I'm not mad.

423
00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.150
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

424
00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.320
Hogwarts is a school.

425
00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.240
A school of magic.

426
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:01.500
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

427
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:05.290
Things other children can't.

428
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.630
I can make things move
without touching them.

429
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:14.140
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.

430
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:18.470
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.

431
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.060
I can make them hurt...

432
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.230
...if I want.

433
00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.650
Who are you?

434
00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.030
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

435
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.650
I'm different.

436
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.110
Prove it.

437
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:44.540
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.

438
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.060
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.

439
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:03.900
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

440
00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.230
You understand me?

441
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.740
I can speak to snakes too.

442
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.780
They find me.

443
00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.700
Whisper things.

444
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:21.080
Is that normal for someone like me?

445
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.440
Did you know, sir? Then?

446
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:51.230
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

447
00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.950
If I had, I...

448
00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:58.030
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

449
00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.540
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

450
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.540
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

451
00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.920
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?

452
00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.130
No, I did not.

453
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:16.130
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.

454
00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.010
And he will not give it up easily.

455
00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.390
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.

456
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.810
I did.

457
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.520
Do you want me to let him?

458
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.270
Yes.

459
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.150
All right. Um...

460
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.400
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...

461
00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:00.700
...just to assess your strengths.

462
00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.410
Quiet! Please!

463
00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:04.740
Shut it!

464
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.330
Thanks. All right. Um...

465
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.630
Just because you
made the team last year...

466
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:16.750
...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?

467
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.550
Good.

468
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:31.480
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

469
00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.230
Hard feelings?

470
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.940
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.

471
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.780
Really? Strapping guy like you?

472
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.530
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

473
00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.120
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

474
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.290
Oh, I like my chances.

475
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:52.250
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?

476
00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:56.590
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?

477
00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:10.600
Come on, Weasley!

478
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:12.480
- Come on, Ron!
- Go on, Weasley!

479
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.900
- Go on, Weasley!
- Yeah, Ron!

480
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:18.320
Go on, Cormac!

481
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:36.920
Come on, Ron!

482
00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.840
Come on, Ron.

483
00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.470
Come on, Ron.

484
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:08.530
Confundus.

485
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:26.970
Isn't he brilliant?

486
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.220
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.

487
00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.350
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

488
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:39.810
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

489
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.900
He's vile.

490
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.120
- Have you ever heard of this spell?
- Sectumsempra?

491
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.370
No, I haven't.

492
00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:55.660
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

493
00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:58.290
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

494
00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:02.630
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

495
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.050
What?

496
00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.590
I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.

497
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.260
No.

498
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.060
Why not?

499
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.220
The binding is fragile.

500
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:18.020
- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.

501
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:23.860
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

502
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:27.780
"This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince."

503
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:48.470
For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it...

504
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:50.930
...yet you have no desire to find out
who he is?

505
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:54.510
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.

506
00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:55.720
Well, it's true.

507
00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:59.640
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.

508
00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:01.810
It's just like being with Hermione.

509
00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:05.610
Well, I was curious, so I went to...

510
00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.320
- The library.
- The library. And?

511
00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.860
And nothing.

512
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:14.030
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.

513
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.330
- There we go. That settles it, then.
- Filius!

514
00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.830
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!

515
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.670
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.

516
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.590
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

517
00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.180
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.

518
00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.970
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...

519
00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.600
No, not there. Over here.

520
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:40.770
No, sit beside me.

521
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.810
Okay.

522
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:46.650
Something to drink?

523
00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.360
Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

524
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.080
Oh, bloody hell.

525
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.880
Slick git.

526
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:10.880
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.

527
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:14.970
And snogging.

528
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:18.600
- I'd like to leave.
- What?

529
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:20.350
You can't be serious.

530
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.890
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?

531
00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.980
What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me? You expect her to leave?

532
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:30.730
- Hey, my boy!
- Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

533
00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.900
And you, and you.

534
00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:34.860
So, what brings you here?

535
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:39.740
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.

536
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:43.370
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.

537
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:46.880
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...

538
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.460
...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...

539
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:52.840
...for the select student or two.

540
00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:56.890
- Would you be game?
- I'd consider it an honor, sir.

541
00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.510
You would be welcome too, Granger.

542
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:06.060
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.

543
00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.900
Good to see you, Wallenby.

544
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.530
What are you playing at?

545
00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.660
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

546
00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:21.790
- Get to know him?
- I don't know.

547
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:25.710
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

548
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.420
Got a little bit...

549
00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:46.190
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

550
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:47.810
- Harry.
- What?

551
00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:51.480
Did you hear what she was saying
back at the pub about me and her snogging?

552
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.030
As if.

553
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.790
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

554
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:28.020
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.

555
00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:45.370
Do not touch that, except by the wrappings.
Do you understand?

556
00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.430
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...

557
00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:04.100
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

558
00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.270
It's like I said.

559
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:11.400
She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.

560
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:15.360
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

561
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:19.700
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

562
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.700
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

563
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:32.920
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?

564
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.420
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.

565
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:40.550
Oh, Severus.

566
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.140
What do you think?

567
00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:54.860
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

568
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.270
She was cursed, wasn't she?

569
00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.110
I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

570
00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:04.200
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.

571
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:06.280
Yes, she was cursed.

572
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.740
It was Malfoy.

573
00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.460
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

574
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:16.130
Indeed.

575
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:20.380
- Your evidence?
- I just know.

576
00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:23.130
You just...

577
00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:25.760
...know.

578
00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:30.720
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

579
00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:34.850
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.

580
00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:41.150
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

581
00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:49.330
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.

582
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.760
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?

583
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:06.470
Well, what does she see in him?

584
00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.850
Dean? He's brilliant.

585
00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:11.850
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.

586
00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:15.810
Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?

587
00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:20.520
Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know? On principle.

588
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:22.690
I suppose.

589
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:27.110
- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.

590
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:30.280
She's smart, funny.

591
00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.330
- Attractive.
- Attractive?

592
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:38.380
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?

593
00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.040
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?

594
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:45.720
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.

595
00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:50.850
Hermione's got nice skin.

596
00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.310
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

597
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:57.350
I've never really thought about it.

598
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.610
But, I suppose, yeah.

599
00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.820
Very nice.

600
00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.620
- I think I'll be going to sleep now.
- Right. Yeah.

601
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:24.420
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

602
00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:27.090
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...

603
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.470
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.

604
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.600
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

605
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.770
What about your uncle, Belby?

606
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:38.390
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

607
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.360
- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.

608
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:45.610
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.

609
00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:49.070
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

610
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:54.370
What about you, Miss Granger? What does
your family do in the Muggle world?

611
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.950
My parents are dentists.

612
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.790
They tend to people's teeth.

613
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:07.710
Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?

614
00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.170
No.

615
00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:15.640
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.

616
00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:17.060
He needed 10 stitches.

617
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:26.940
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

618
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:34.070
- Look at her eyes.
- They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

619
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.950
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

620
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:45.170
No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.

621
00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:54.180
What?

622
00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:55.970
Nothing.

623
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:05.940
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

624
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.570
- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.

625
00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.320
I was just admiring your hourglass.

626
00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:18.160
Oh, yes.

627
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:20.750
A most intriguing object.

628
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:25.670
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

629
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:29.210
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

630
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:31.630
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going.

631
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.140
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

632
00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.550
As to some of your classmates...

633
00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:41.140
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.

634
00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:42.810
The shelf, sir?

635
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:47.020
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

636
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:51.070
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?

637
00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:54.570
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

638
00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:00.660
You knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle?
You were his teacher.

639
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:05.250
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.

640
00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:07.000
What was he like?

641
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:13.090
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

642
00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.590
He killed my parents.

643
00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:19.640
Of course.

644
00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:23.020
It's only natural
you should want to know more.

645
00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.940
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.

646
00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:31.110
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...

647
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:35.530
...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.

648
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.450
Not unlike others I've known.

649
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:40.120
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

650
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:43.540
If the monster existed...

651
00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:46.330
...it was buried deep within.

652
01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.140
Good luck, eh, Ron.

653
01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.020
- Nice hat!
- Ron, you're a loser.

654
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:12.270
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

655
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.780
- Looking good, Ron.
- Loser!

656
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:18.490
What's he wearing?

657
01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.960
So how was it, then?

658
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:32.500
- How was what?
- Your dinner party?

659
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:34.300
Pretty boring, actually.

660
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.420
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

661
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:43.600
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

662
01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.310
And we're meant to bring someone.

663
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:49.190
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

664
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:52.190
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?

665
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.030
Good luck today, Ron.

666
01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:00.200
I know you'll be brilliant.

667
01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.000
I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

668
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.660
Have it your way.

669
01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:11.330
- Juice?
- Sure.

670
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.210
Hello, everyone.

671
01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.550
You look dreadful, Ron.

672
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:19.090
Is that why you put something
in his cup?

673
01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.930
Is it a tonic?

674
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:28.020
Liquid luck.

675
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:31.060
Don't drink it, Ron.

676
01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:42.030
- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

677
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.870
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.

678
01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:12.600
Yes!

679
01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.860
Go on, Ron! Do it!

680
01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:52.100
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

681
01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.940
Yes!

682
01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.560
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

683
01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.940
Whoo!

684
01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:06.320
Yes. Whoo!

685
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:12.910
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

686
01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:18.880
You really shouldn't have done it.

687
01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:24.050
I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.

688
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:29.680
That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.

689
01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.180
You didn't put it in.

690
01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.730
Ron only thought you did.

691
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:28.820
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

692
01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.580
Well, they're really good.

693
01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.090
How does it feel, Harry?

694
01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.130
When you see Dean with Ginny?

695
01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.680
I know.

696
01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.930
I see the way you look at her.

697
01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.270
You're my best friend.

698
01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.200
Oops.

699
01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.870
I think this room's taken.

700
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.040
What's with the birds?

701
01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.130
Oppugno.

702
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.860
It feels like this.

703
01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:35.620
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.

704
01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:40.870
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.

705
01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.460
It's chemical.

706
01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:46.960
Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.

707
01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:52.550
He's at perfect liberty to kiss whoever
he likes. I really couldn't care less.

708
01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:56.550
Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?

709
01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.220
Yes.

710
01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:02.810
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.

711
01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.190
Have you?

712
01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:06.350
Yes. Why?

713
01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.150
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...

714
01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.570
...we should go together, as friends.

715
01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.360
Why didn't I think of that?

716
01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:16.070
Who are you going with?

717
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.030
Um, it's a surprise.

718
01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.410
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry about.
You can't just take anyone.

719
01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.910
See that girl over there?

720
01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:31.250
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.

721
01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:32.920
Really?

722
01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.340
Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.

723
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:39.220
But I am the Chosen One.

724
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:42.270
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

725
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:45.730
I'll ask someone I like.

726
01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.060
Someone cool.

727
01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.870
I've never been to this part of the castle.

728
01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.290
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

729
01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:06.960
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

730
01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.760
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

731
01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.690
Drink?

732
01:09:17.610 --> 01:09:18.950
Neville.

733
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:20.570
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

734
01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.870
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

735
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:26.830
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.

736
01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.220
Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?

737
01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:45.680
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

738
01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:48.890
Cormac? That's who you invited?

739
01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.560
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

740
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.400
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

741
01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:57.570
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.

742
01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:59.900
- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

743
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:02.740
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.

744
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:04.740
On second thoughts...

745
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:06.910
Might keep Cormac at bay.

746
01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.160
Oh, God, here he comes.

747
01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:15.590
I think she just went to powder her nose.

748
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:17.840
Slippery little minx, your friend.

749
01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:20.720
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?

750
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.760
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

751
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:28.560
Dragon balls.

752
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.900
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

753
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:46.950
Not so quick, Potter.

754
01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:51.620
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...

755
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:55.710
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

756
01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.130
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

757
01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:01.010
- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

758
01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:04.840
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

759
01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:06.550
You see...

760
01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:12.270
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.

761
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:13.980
Traveling where?

762
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:23.990
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

763
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:26.820
Professor Slughorn, sir.

764
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:31.330
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

765
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.540
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

766
01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:37.000
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?

767
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:41.000
I'll escort him out.

768
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.470
Certainly, professor.

769
01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:54.350
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

770
01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:01.360
- Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
- Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

771
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:03.610
I swore to protect you.

772
01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:07.110
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

773
01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.450
I don't need protection.

774
01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:13.790
I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.

775
01:12:14.710 --> 01:12:18.250
- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

776
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:22.750
You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious.
Let me assist you.

777
01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.380
No!

778
01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.130
I was chosen. This is my moment.

779
01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.150
"Unbreakable Vow."

780
01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.940
You're sure that's what Snape said?

781
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.400
Positive. Why?

782
01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:50.070
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

783
01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.580
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.

784
01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.830
You don't understand.

785
01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:57.500
Oh, bloody hell.

786
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.280
I miss you.

787
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:30.530
Lovely.

788
01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:33.990
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.

789
01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.370
I'll take your word for it.

790
01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:51.430
So, what happens to you? What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

791
01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:53.680
You die.

792
01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.140
Wait, the pudding's still here.

793
01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.730
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

794
01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:05.980
I know it sounds mad.

795
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:09.650
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

796
01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:12.320
...so he could find out
what he was up to?

797
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:15.490
- That's not what it sounded like.
- Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.

798
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:17.660
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

799
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:21.330
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

800
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:25.580
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.

801
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:26.920
You're blinded by hatred.

802
01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:29.130
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

803
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.880
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

804
01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:36.010
We place our trust
in a handful of people.

805
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:39.140
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.

806
01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.170
Open up, you.

807
01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.460
Don't you trust me?

808
01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.800
It's good.

809
01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.560
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.

810
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:29.110
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.

811
01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.580
You'll have to forgive Remus.

812
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:45.660
It takes its toll, his condition.

813
01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.630
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

814
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:51.340
We're being followed, all of us.

815
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:54.010
Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.

816
01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.930
It's not been easy.

817
01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:00.350
Did you get my owl?

818
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:02.600
Yes, I did.

819
01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:07.140
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

820
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:09.770
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

821
01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.980
As for Draco Malfoy...

822
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:14.780
...I know a bit more.

823
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.450
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

824
01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.950
I think, from what you described...

825
01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.790
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

826
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:26.460
...the object
that Draco is so interested in...

827
01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:28.120
...is a vanishing cabinet.

828
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.290
A vanishing cabinet?

829
01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:34.460
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

830
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:37.590
You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

831
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.510
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

832
01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.890
They can transport you anywhere.

833
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.440
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.

834
01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.520
What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?

835
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:52.820
Nothing.

836
01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:55.360
It's still there.

837
01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:08.160
It was delicious, Molly, really.

838
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:09.670
Are you sure you won't stay?

839
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:14.340
No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.

840
01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.010
Remus?

841
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:25.890
Sweetheart.

842
01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:35.940
Has Ron gone to bed?

843
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:38.940
Um... Not yet. No.

844
01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.070
Shoelace.

845
01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.550
Merry Christmas, Harry.

846
01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.510
Merry Christmas.

847
01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:19.070
- Harry, no!
- Remus!

848
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:30.330
Ginny!

849
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:38.170
- I killed Sirius Black!
- I killed Sirius Black!

850
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.590
You coming to get me?

851
01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.010
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?

852
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.130
Harry?

853
01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.310
Stupefy!

854
01:19:58.170 --> 01:19:59.920
Harry!

855
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:14.640
Ginny!

856
01:20:44.210 --> 01:20:45.710
Molly.

857
01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:10.410
It's easy for them to get to you.

858
01:21:10.570 --> 01:21:14.700
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

859
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:17.410
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

860
01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:19.580
Sorry.

861
01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:24.590
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

862
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:26.920
That's my Won-Won.

863
01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:31.340
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

864
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:51.280
I'd like to know
where you get your information.

865
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:54.490
More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.

866
01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.670
Sir...

867
01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:04.960
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

868
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:07.920
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

869
01:22:08.170 --> 01:22:12.340
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

870
01:22:12.930 --> 01:22:15.220
But how did you know?

871
01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.640
Intuition.

872
01:22:22.810 --> 01:22:24.610
Gracious. Is it that time already?

873
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:28.360
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

874
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:36.330
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

875
01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.330
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.

876
01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:44.500
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

877
01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:50.420
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

878
01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.840
They might misunderstand.

879
01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:55.590
Go on.

880
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:58.680
I was in the library the other night...

881
01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.430
...in the Restricted Section...

882
01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:05.730
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

883
01:23:06.650 --> 01:23:10.150
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

884
01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.110
It's called, as I understand it...

885
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:17.200
I beg your pardon?

886
01:23:17.370 --> 01:23:20.950
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

887
01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:25.920
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

888
01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.050
Confused?

889
01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:32.210
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

890
01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:35.880
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

891
01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:39.720
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

892
01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.810
It is also a lie.

893
01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:44.520
This memory has been tampered with...

894
01:23:44.690 --> 01:23:49.060
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

895
01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:51.690
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

896
01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:54.740
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?

897
01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:56.410
Why, indeed?

898
01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.580
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

899
01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:04.370
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

900
01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.080
...any way you can.

901
01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:08.210
I don't know him that well, sir.

902
01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:15.590
This memory is everything.

903
01:24:16.090 --> 01:24:18.090
Without it, we are blind.

904
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:22.220
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

905
01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:26.100
You have no choice.

906
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:29.310
You must not fail.

907
01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:39.780
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

908
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:41.370
...with the chapter on antidotes.

909
01:24:41.530 --> 01:24:45.290
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.

910
01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.960
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

911
01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:57.220
Aha. if it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

912
01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:59.300
To what do I owe this pleasure?

913
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:02.550
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

914
01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.970
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

915
01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:08.140
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

916
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:11.980
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

917
01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.980
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

918
01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:19.490
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

919
01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:23.990
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

920
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.410
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

921
01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:30.330
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

922
01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.420
Yes. Um...

923
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:35.090
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

924
01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:37.050
What I mean to say is...

925
01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.670
...well, he's not like you.

926
01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.180
He might misunderstand.

927
01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:47.310
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

928
01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:51.520
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

929
01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:53.810
I suggest you do the same.

930
01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:57.190
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?

931
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.200
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

932
01:26:09.210 --> 01:26:10.830
Didn't he?

933
01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:19.510
Yes?

934
01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:22.010
Oh, it's you, Potter.

935
01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:24.550
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

936
01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.150
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

937
01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.570
Divine.

938
01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.530
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

939
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:51.250
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

940
01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:54.920
- Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

941
01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.090
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.

942
01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:59.590
She could never annoy me.

943
01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:02.920
I think I love her.

944
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:08.810
Well, brilliant.

945
01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.270
Do you think she knows I exist?

946
01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.940
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.

947
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:20.070
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

948
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:22.240
Who are you talking about?

949
01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:26.620
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

950
01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:28.280
Okay, very funny.

951
01:27:31.410 --> 01:27:35.080
- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

952
01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:38.130
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

953
01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:42.050
No. Can you introduce me?

954
01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:08.490
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

955
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:22.960
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

956
01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.220
Where's Romilda?

957
01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.340
What's the matter with Wenby?

958
01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.680
Very powerful love potion.

959
01:28:29.850 --> 01:28:32.220
Very well. Better bring him in.

960
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:35.680
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

961
01:28:35.850 --> 01:28:38.770
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

962
01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:42.020
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

963
01:28:42.190 --> 01:28:43.860
Perhaps you're right.

964
01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:53.790
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

965
01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:58.330
Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?

966
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.420
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.

967
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:04.170
All the questions about Voldemort.

968
01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:06.170
Don't use that name.

969
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:15.970
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

970
01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:19.270
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.

971
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:36.080
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.

972
01:29:36.250 --> 01:29:38.370
A bloody strong one at that.

973
01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.580
- I feel really bad.
- You need a pick-me-up, my boy.

974
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:46.420
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

975
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:50.930
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

976
01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:54.930
Here we are, Potter.

977
01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:56.600
To life!

978
01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.440
Ron.

979
01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:08.360
Ron. Professor, do something.

980
01:30:09.450 --> 01:30:11.070
I don't understand.

981
01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:29.260
Come on, Ron, breathe.

982
01:30:51.490 --> 01:30:54.320
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

983
01:31:05.330 --> 01:31:08.710
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

984
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:11.260
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

985
01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:14.840
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

986
01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:17.760
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

987
01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:21.930
The question is,
why were they necessary?

988
01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:23.850
Why, indeed?

989
01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:26.020
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

990
01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:29.190
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

991
01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.320
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

992
01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:35.950
...when not polluted with poison.

993
01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.240
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

994
01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:40.790
To whom, I might ask?

995
01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:44.790
To you, Headmaster.

996
01:31:47.130 --> 01:31:48.210
Where is he?

997
01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:52.510
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?

998
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:57.220
What's she doing here?

999
01:31:57.390 --> 01:31:59.640
I might ask you the same question.

1000
01:31:59.810 --> 01:32:02.060
I happen to be his girlfriend.

1001
01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:04.980
I happen to be his friend.

1002
01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:09.360
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

1003
01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:13.030
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.

1004
01:32:13.190 --> 01:32:16.910
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1005
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:19.910
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1006
01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:26.620
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

1007
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:30.080
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1008
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:32.590
I'm here.

1009
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:41.640
Uh... Hermione...

1010
01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:50.690
Hermione.

1011
01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:02.200
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

1012
01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:04.870
Well, come away, everybody.

1013
01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:07.660
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1014
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.460
About time, don't you think?

1015
01:33:17.130 --> 01:33:18.720
Thank you.

1016
01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:23.470
Oh, shut up.

1017
01:35:35.770 --> 01:35:39.570
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1018
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:46.700
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1019
01:35:47.530 --> 01:35:50.370
Um, well...

1020
01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:53.540
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.

1021
01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:56.830
And you talked.

1022
01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:02.510
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1023
01:36:02.670 --> 01:36:05.970
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

1024
01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:08.470
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1025
01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:18.480
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1026
01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:25.150
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?

1027
01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:28.320
Anything at all?

1028
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:30.320
There is something.

1029
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:38.290
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

1030
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:43.000
Right. Boggled.

1031
01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:51.510
Harry.

1032
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:54.140
That's Katie.

1033
01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:57.730
Katie Bell.

1034
01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.780
Katie. How are you?

1035
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:12.950
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.

1036
01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:18.120
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1037
01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:21.960
But I just can't.

1038
01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:36.560
Katie?

1039
01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:23.100
- I know what you did, Malfoy.
- You hexed her, didn't you?

1040
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:55.470
Sectumsempra!

1041
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:45.350
Vulnera Sanentur.

1042
01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:49.620
Vulnera Sanentur.

1043
01:40:16.130 --> 01:40:19.680
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1044
01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.190
Take my hand.

1045
01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.080
The Room of Requirement.

1046
01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:53.170
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1047
01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:57.050
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

1048
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:06.850
- What was that?
- What was that?

1049
01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.300
See?

1050
01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.880
You never know what you'll find up here.

1051
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:59.950
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1052
01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:05.490
Close your eyes.

1053
01:42:32.190 --> 01:42:35.060
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

1054
01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:52.080
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

1055
01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:53.420
What?

1056
01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:55.670
You know, hide the book?

1057
01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.710
Oh, yeah.

1058
01:43:00.630 --> 01:43:03.220
Ah. Dear, yes.

1059
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:06.180
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?

1060
01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:09.560
Luck.

1061
01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:13.940
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1062
01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:35.290
Well, how do you feel?

1063
01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.080
Excellent.

1064
01:43:38.250 --> 01:43:40.250
Really excellent.

1065
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:44.590
Remember...

1066
01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:46.680
...Slughorn usually eats early...

1067
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:49.850
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

1068
01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:51.520
Right.

1069
01:43:51.930 --> 01:43:54.100
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?

1070
01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:56.940
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

1071
01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:01.110
- We have a plan.
- I know...

1072
01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.360
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1073
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:07.280
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?

1074
01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.410
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1075
01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.750
Or Felix does.

1076
01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:15.370
Hi!

1077
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:47.700
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1078
01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:51.990
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

1079
01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:54.120
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

1080
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:57.710
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

1081
01:44:57.870 --> 01:44:59.960
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1082
01:45:00.130 --> 01:45:02.920
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

1083
01:45:03.090 --> 01:45:06.670
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?

1084
01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:09.180
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1085
01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:12.850
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.

1086
01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:16.810
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

1087
01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:20.270
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

1088
01:45:23.530 --> 01:45:25.690
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

1089
01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:27.360
Through the front door, sir.

1090
01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:29.700
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

1091
01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.570
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1092
01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:34.030
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

1093
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:36.450
Harry!

1094
01:45:37.290 --> 01:45:39.750
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.

1095
01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:43.380
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1096
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:46.130
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1097
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:54.680
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...

1098
01:45:54.850 --> 01:45:56.600
...back to the castle immediately!

1099
01:45:56.770 --> 01:46:00.020
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1100
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:03.480
And what makes you say that?

1101
01:46:04.570 --> 01:46:06.150
No idea.

1102
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:14.330
Horace.

1103
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:20.250
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?

1104
01:46:20.830 --> 01:46:22.920
A dead one, I think, sir.

1105
01:46:23.710 --> 01:46:25.250
Good God.

1106
01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:28.960
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?

1107
01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:32.720
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

1108
01:46:32.890 --> 01:46:37.100
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1109
01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.060
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1110
01:46:41.230 --> 01:46:43.440
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

1111
01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:45.810
Not to mention the pincers.

1112
01:46:50.110 --> 01:46:52.070
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1113
01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:56.160
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

1114
01:46:56.330 --> 01:47:00.410
...but Acromantula venom
is uncommonly rare.

1115
01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.790
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?

1116
01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:05.580
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

1117
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:08.670
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

1118
01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:10.050
My thoughts exactly.

1119
01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:16.720
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

1120
01:47:16.970 --> 01:47:21.980
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1121
01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:25.100
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1122
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:28.940
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1123
01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.940
Oh, dear.

1124
01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:44.870
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.

1125
01:47:45.130 --> 01:47:46.670
He had a family, I trust?

1126
01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:48.340
Oh, yeah.

1127
01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:55.180
Farewell...

1128
01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:57.220
Aragog.

1129
01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:04.640
Farewell, Aragog...

1130
01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:07.690
...king of the arachnids.

1131
01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:11.110
Your body will decay...

1132
01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:15.200
...but your spirit lingers on.

1133
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:22.540
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

1134
01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:41.350
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1135
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:45.230
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1136
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:50.560
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1137
01:48:50.730 --> 01:48:55.900
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1138
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:57.650
Poof.

1139
01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:01.030
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?

1140
01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:04.910
But that's life, I suppose.

1141
01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:10.420
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1142
01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:14.250
- Poof.
- Poof.

1143
01:49:28.810 --> 01:49:31.940
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1144
01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:37.240
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1145
01:49:38.150 --> 01:49:41.110
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1146
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:45.450
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1147
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.460
As I watched, it sank.

1148
01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:53.790
Just before it reached the bottom...

1149
01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:55.420
...it transformed...

1150
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.630
...into a wee fish.

1151
01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:02.430
It was beautiful magic.

1152
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.680
Wondrous to behold.

1153
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:11.060
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1154
01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:14.480
Your mother.

1155
01:50:16.530 --> 01:50:19.030
The day I came downstairs...

1156
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:22.280
...the day the bowl was empty...

1157
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:25.990
...was the day your mother...

1158
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
I know why you're here.

1159
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
But I can't help you.

1160
01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:40.510
It would ruin me.

1161
01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:46.680
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1162
01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:49.060
The night I got this?

1163
01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:52.440
Because of her.

1164
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:55.150
Because she sacrificed herself.

1165
01:50:55.570 --> 01:50:57.940
Because she refused to step aside.

1166
01:50:58.110 --> 01:51:01.320
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1167
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:05.200
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1168
01:51:06.030 --> 01:51:08.160
I'm going to tell you something.

1169
01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:12.040
Something others have only guessed at.

1170
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.500
It's true.

1171
01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:17.380
I am the Chosen One.

1172
01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:20.590
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1173
01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:24.050
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1174
01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:26.600
...and I need to know what you told him.

1175
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:29.720
Be brave, professor.

1176
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:33.440
Be brave like my mother.

1177
01:51:34.730 --> 01:51:37.400
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1178
01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.820
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1179
01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:47.030
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1180
01:51:57.590 --> 01:52:00.710
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1181
01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:06.010
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1182
01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:45.470
I was in the library the other night...

1183
01:52:45.630 --> 01:52:47.800
...in the Restricted Section...

1184
01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:52.310
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1185
01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:56.350
It's called, as I understand it...

1186
01:52:57.650 --> 01:52:58.980
...a Horcrux.

1187
01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:03.570
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1188
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:06.650
I came across the term while reading...

1189
01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:09.820
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1190
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:14.490
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but
this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.

1191
01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:16.200
Which is...

1192
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:19.170
...why I came to you.

1193
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.630
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1194
01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:30.430
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1195
01:53:33.010 --> 01:53:37.020
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1196
01:53:37.190 --> 01:53:40.810
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1197
01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:42.110
Protected?

1198
01:53:42.270 --> 01:53:45.480
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1199
01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:49.360
In other words, you cannot die.

1200
01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:59.710
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1201
01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:02.670
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1202
01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:05.380
Murder.

1203
01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:07.210
Yes.

1204
01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:12.680
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1205
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:18.310
- Can you only split the soul once?
- For instance, isn't seven...?

1206
01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:19.980
Seven?

1207
01:54:20.730 --> 01:54:26.020
Merlin's beard, Tom. isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1208
01:54:26.190 --> 01:54:29.950
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1209
01:54:31.110 --> 01:54:34.160
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1210
01:54:38.910 --> 01:54:40.250
Of course, sir.

1211
01:54:43.210 --> 01:54:45.210
It'll be our little secret.

1212
01:54:54.010 --> 01:54:55.260
Sir.

1213
01:55:10.650 --> 01:55:12.780
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1214
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:15.620
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1215
01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:18.910
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1216
01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:20.120
What are they exactly?

1217
01:55:20.290 --> 01:55:23.620
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1218
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:28.500
A ring, for example.

1219
01:55:29.130 --> 01:55:30.630
Or a book.

1220
01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.300
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1221
01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:36.930
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1222
01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:39.390
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1223
01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:41.470
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1224
01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:46.650
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1225
01:55:46.810 --> 01:55:48.820
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1226
01:55:49.190 --> 01:55:53.950
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1227
01:55:54.110 --> 01:55:57.990
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1228
01:55:58.160 --> 01:55:59.330
One destroys Voldemort.

1229
01:55:59.490 --> 01:56:02.410
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1230
01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:05.830
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1231
01:56:19.810 --> 01:56:21.680
...leaves traces.

1232
01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:31.570
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1233
01:56:31.730 --> 01:56:34.030
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1234
01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:37.950
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1235
01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:42.200
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1236
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:48.420
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1237
01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:54.670
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1238
01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:57.470
...that you take too much for granted?

1239
01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:02.680
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this any more?

1240
01:57:02.850 --> 01:57:04.980
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1241
01:57:05.850 --> 01:57:11.650
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1242
01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:31.670
Oh, Harry.

1243
01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:36.590
You need a shave, my friend.

1244
01:57:39.390 --> 01:57:43.600
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1245
01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:47.730
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1246
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:51.650
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1247
01:57:52.110 --> 01:57:53.610
I'm an old man.

1248
01:57:53.770 --> 01:57:55.440
You still look the same to me, sir.

1249
01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:59.900
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1250
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:03.280
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1251
01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:10.540
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1252
01:58:10.710 --> 01:58:14.210
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1253
01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:16.210
But there is one condition:

1254
01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:19.590
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1255
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:22.090
Yes, sir.

1256
01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:24.390
You do understand what I'm saying?

1257
01:58:24.970 --> 01:58:27.470
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1258
01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:29.980
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1259
01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:34.150
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1260
01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:40.900
Your word, Harry.

1261
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:44.030
My word.

1262
01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:46.490
Take my arm.

1263
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:50.330
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1264
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.460
Well, being me has its privileges.

1265
01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:43.340
This is the place.

1266
01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:45.720
Oh, yes.

1267
01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:49.220
This place has known magic.

1268
01:59:57.230 --> 01:59:58.770
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

1269
01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:00.360
...payment must be made.

1270
02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:04.150
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1271
02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:07.570
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

1272
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:10.740
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1273
02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:37.270
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1274
02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:40.770
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1275
02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:44.780
Careful.

1276
02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:09.430
There it is.

1277
02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:13.640
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1278
02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:37.660
If you would, Harry.

1279
02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:27.380
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1280
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:29.380
Oh, yes.

1281
02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:42.060
It has to be drunk.

1282
02:02:42.230 --> 02:02:45.060
All of it has to be drunk.

1283
02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:49.240
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

1284
02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.820
This potion might paralyze me.

1285
02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:53.910
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1286
02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:57.990
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1287
02:02:58.250 --> 02:03:00.160
You are not to indulge these requests.

1288
02:03:00.330 --> 02:03:03.880
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1289
02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:06.500
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1290
02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:09.090
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

1291
02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:14.680
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

1292
02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:20.680
Your good health, Harry.

1293
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:38.120
Professor.

1294
02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:41.450
Professor!

1295
02:03:48.130 --> 02:03:49.630
Harry.

1296
02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:52.300
Professor, can you hear me?

1297
02:03:53.590 --> 02:03:54.760
Professor.

1298
02:04:10.190 --> 02:04:11.320
No. Don't.

1299
02:04:11.490 --> 02:04:13.820
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?

1300
02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:24.960
- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...

1301
02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:29.540
...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.

1302
02:04:29.710 --> 02:04:31.840
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.

1303
02:04:32.010 --> 02:04:34.300
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

1304
02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:37.300
It's my fault.

1305
02:04:38.970 --> 02:04:40.180
It's all my fault.

1306
02:04:42.020 --> 02:04:43.640
It's my fault.

1307
02:04:43.810 --> 02:04:47.190
- Just one more, sir.
- One more, and then I promise...

1308
02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:50.190
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1309
02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:52.190
- I promise.
- No.

1310
02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:54.610
Please.

1311
02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:20.220
Harry.

1312
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:28.950
Water.

1313
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:40.780
You did it, sir.

1314
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:42.410
Look.

1315
02:05:44.410 --> 02:05:45.660
Harry.

1316
02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:48.370
Water.

1317
02:05:50.130 --> 02:05:51.790
Aguamenti.

1318
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.460
Water.

1319
02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:31.000
Lumos.

1320
02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:01.360
Lumos Maxima!

1321
02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:12.670
Harry.

1322
02:07:16.710 --> 02:07:17.840
Sectumsempra!

1323
02:07:18.010 --> 02:07:19.170
Harry.

1324
02:07:20.130 --> 02:07:21.760
- Stupefy!
- Harry.

1325
02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:22.230
Harry.

1326
02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:28.570
Partis Temporus!

1327
02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:14.250
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

1328
02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:58.790
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

1329
02:10:01.210 --> 02:10:02.590
No.

1330
02:10:03.630 --> 02:10:06.300
Severus. Severus is who I need.

1331
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:10.010
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

1332
02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:11.840
Speak to no one else.

1333
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:14.680
Severus, Harry.

1334
02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:22.400
Hide yourself below, Harry.

1335
02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:26.860
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

1336
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:30.820
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

1337
02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:33.280
Harry, do as I say.

1338
02:10:36.910 --> 02:10:41.420
Trust me.

1339
02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:03.810
Good evening, Draco.

1340
02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:08.230
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

1341
02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:10.150
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

1342
02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.410
- I often talk aloud to myself.
- I find it extraordinarily useful.

1343
02:11:16.540 --> 02:11:19.370
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?

1344
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:23.330
Draco...

1345
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.960
...you are no assassin.
- How do you know what I am?

1346
02:11:27.130 --> 02:11:28.920
I've done things that would shock you.

1347
02:11:29.090 --> 02:11:33.220
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

1348
02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:36.010
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?

1349
02:11:36.180 --> 02:11:37.760
Forgive me, Draco.

1350
02:11:37.930 --> 02:11:40.430
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...

1351
02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:42.980
...your heart can't really
have been in them.

1352
02:11:43.140 --> 02:11:46.360
He trusts me. I was chosen.

1353
02:11:50.150 --> 02:11:51.940
Then I shall make it easy for you.

1354
02:11:52.110 --> 02:11:53.780
Expelliarmus!

1355
02:11:57.120 --> 02:11:59.450
Very good. Very good.

1356
02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:02.660
You're not alone.

1357
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:04.790
There are others.

1358
02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:08.250
How?

1359
02:12:09.550 --> 02:12:12.210
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

1360
02:12:12.970 --> 02:12:15.340
- I've been mending it.
- Let me guess.

1361
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:18.470
It has a sister. A twin.

1362
02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:20.850
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.

1363
02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:22.810
Ingenious.

1364
02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:24.730
Draco...

1365
02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:30.980
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1366
02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:34.820
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help!

1367
02:12:35.610 --> 02:12:39.120
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

1368
02:12:40.330 --> 02:12:41.990
I have to kill you.

1369
02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:44.660
Or he's gonna kill me.

1370
02:12:54.170 --> 02:12:57.800
Well, look what we have here.

1371
02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:01.850
Well done, Draco.

1372
02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:07.350
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1373
02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:10.560
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?

1374
02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:15.860
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

1375
02:13:16.490 --> 02:13:17.860
Do it.

1376
02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:23.290
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.

1377
02:13:23.700 --> 02:13:25.200
Let me finish him in my own way.

1378
02:13:25.370 --> 02:13:29.000
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.

1379
02:13:29.170 --> 02:13:31.210
This is your moment. Do it.

1380
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:34.760
Go on, Draco.

1381
02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:37.090
Now!

1382
02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:39.680
No.

1383
02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.110
Severus.

1384
02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:03.580
Please.

1385
02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:05.910
Avada Kedavra.

1386
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:52.120
Yeah!

1387
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:13.770
Hagrid! Hello?

1388
02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:17.980
Snape! He trusted you!

1389
02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:23.950
Go on.

1390
02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:26.330
Incarcerous.

1391
02:15:26.490 --> 02:15:29.160
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

1392
02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:34.000
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

1393
02:15:54.150 --> 02:15:55.520
Sectumsempra!

1394
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:09.240
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

1395
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:11.160
Yes.

1396
02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:16.040
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1397
02:20:04.100 --> 02:20:05.560
Potter...

1398
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:08.770
...in light of what has happened...

1399
02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:13.490
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...

1400
02:20:15.450 --> 02:20:19.450
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...

1401
02:20:21.290 --> 02:20:23.750
...you meant a great deal to him.

1402
02:20:42.020 --> 02:20:44.180
Do you think he would've done it?

1403
02:20:44.350 --> 02:20:46.230
Draco?

1404
02:20:47.310 --> 02:20:48.650
No.

1405
02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:51.860
No, he was lowering his wand.

1406
02:20:52.900 --> 02:20:54.860
In the end, it was Snape.

1407
02:20:55.490 --> 02:20:57.950
It was always Snape.

1408
02:20:58.120 --> 02:21:00.330
And I did nothing.

1409
02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:08.420
It's fake.

1410
02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.340
Open it.

1411
02:21:22.350 --> 02:21:26.350
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this..."

1412
02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:30.190
...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.

1413
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:35.070
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.

1414
02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:38.280
I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...

1415
02:21:38.450 --> 02:21:40.700
...you will be mortal once more.

1416
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:43.660
"R.A.B."

1417
02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:46.370
R.A.B.

1418
02:21:46.750 --> 02:21:48.040
Don't know.

1419
02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:52.710
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

1420
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:55.210
Which means it was all a waste.

1421
02:21:56.550 --> 02:21:58.050
All of it.

1422
02:22:04.270 --> 02:22:06.350
Ron's okay with it, you know.

1423
02:22:06.850 --> 02:22:08.350
You and Ginny.

1424
02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:12.690
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

1425
02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:16.030
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

1426
02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:19.910
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

1427
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:22.910
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

1428
02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:26.700
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.

1429
02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:30.670
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

1430
02:22:30.830 --> 02:22:33.500
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

1431
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:38.800
You don't really think
you're going to be able...

1432
02:22:38.970 --> 02:22:41.340
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

1433
02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:47.270
You need us, Harry.

1434
02:23:03.070 --> 02:23:06.160
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.
