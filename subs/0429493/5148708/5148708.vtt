13
00:01:57.535 --> 00:01:59.161
plan ahead.

<i>Flow like oregano.</i>

22
00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:47.561
<i>You already know my competition's

23
00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:48.854

24
00:03:48.938 --> 00:03:50.648
<i>For you be a mother...</i>

25
00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:54.068
<i>You scrap it's too animated
like The Incredibles.</i>

26
00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:55.945
<i>Let this beef go around
like the twenty six's.</i>

27
00:03:56.857 --> 00:03:58.067
<i>It's young Game of flame.</i>

28
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.444
<i>Welcome to the House of Pain.</i>

29
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:06.075
Where's my girl, fool?

30
00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:08.535
She cool, man. She in there.
She's still fine as hell.

31
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.370
So that's it?
Bada-bing, you out of the game?

32
00:04:10.496 --> 00:04:11.997
Done with the whole trade?

33
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:13.332
- Yeah.
- Well, that's the problem, Bosco.

34
00:04:13.415 --> 00:04:14.708
You either keep doing that,

35
00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:16.585
or you do a 15-year bid
in a Mexican prison

36
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.629
with Cheeto's cousin in there.

37
00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:21.965
Same old shit. You choose
how to flush the toilet, brother.

38
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:23.759
That's right. Easy way or the hard way.

39
00:04:47.324 --> 00:04:48.826
Come on!

40
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.666
Okay, street soldier. Shit.

41
00:04:56.267 --> 00:04:59.270
But watch yourself, B.A., now,
you gonna lose your oldest friend here.

42
00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:08.112
What's up, girl? You miss me?

43
00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:12.450
Because I missed you. Yes, I did.
It's been too long, baby.

44
00:05:12.784 --> 00:05:14.369
Way too long.

45
00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:23.044
Heck of a place.

46
00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:24.963
Just a heck of a beautiful place.

47
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:27.799
Is this a time-share?
I'd love to get in on this.

48
00:05:27.882 --> 00:05:31.094
I like this whole Santa Fe motif
you got going here, Tuco.

49
00:05:31.427 --> 00:05:34.639
It's very Arizona, very Tex-Mex.
It's good. It's good.

50
00:05:34.806 --> 00:05:36.182
Maybe we can get the guy at my six

51
00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:38.518
to whip up a couple of quesadiches,
you know?

52
00:05:42.188 --> 00:05:45.817


53
00:05:47.944 --> 00:05:49.404
<i>Americana, gringo.</i>

54
00:05:49.654 --> 00:05:51.864
- Army Intelligence.
- Who's that?

55
00:05:51.948 --> 00:05:53.408
- You, man.
- No.

56
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:55.785
You're not so intelligent
because you're stuck in some tires.

57
00:05:55.868 --> 00:05:57.328
I'm happy. I'm happy.

58
00:05:57.412 --> 00:06:00.164
Doesn't get any better than this, right?

59
00:06:00.331 --> 00:06:01.833
- I'm living the dream.
- You are!

60
00:06:04.168 --> 00:06:05.461
You're gonna come here...

61
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:09.632


62
00:06:10.008 --> 00:06:11.843


63
00:06:11.926 --> 00:06:13.803
Well, first of all, she's so hot,

64
00:06:13.886 --> 00:06:16.931
and we both hate you.
So that's just sort of how it...

65
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:21.185
- Good morning!
- Good morning, man!

66
00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:22.979
Now it's a party!

67
00:06:23.521 --> 00:06:26.482
- Is that your best shot?
- Now it's a party, man!

68
00:06:50.173 --> 00:06:53.634
<i>A-ha, okay, what's up? Shut up.</i>

69
00:06:53.718 --> 00:06:56.888
<i>A-ha, okay, what's up? Shut up.</i>

70
00:06:56.971 --> 00:07:00.391
<i>A-ha, okay, what's up? Shut up.</i>

71
00:07:00.892 --> 00:07:01.893
Whoa!

72
00:07:03.436 --> 00:07:06.314
<i>Okay, what's up? Shut up.</i>

73
00:07:08.566 --> 00:07:11.402
<i>I got</i> a <i>pocket full of B's
Cocoa weed and ain't got no place to</i> go...

74
00:07:12.904 --> 00:07:14.572
Oh, hell, no.

75
00:07:14.906 --> 00:07:16.699
Slide over slowly.

76
00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:18.659
You jacking me?

77
00:07:19.452 --> 00:07:20.787
What is this, opposite day?

78
00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:24.916
I'm not a thief. But if I don't reach
my friend in time, then he dies.

79
00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:28.711
If you ain't a thief,
I guarantee you ain't a killer.

80
00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:33.925
Take your left hand off the wheel
and your right hand off the shifter now.

81
00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:36.427
You ain't gonna
shoot me in the head, pops.

82
00:07:36.636 --> 00:07:39.138
You know that ain't happening.

83
00:07:41.474 --> 00:07:43.101
What the hell's wrong with you, man?

84
00:07:43.226 --> 00:07:44.560
You shoot a total stranger?

85
00:07:44.644 --> 00:07:46.562
I don't even know you, fool. Damn.

86
00:07:46.646 --> 00:07:48.356
It'll heal, I promise.

87
00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:50.525
- Here, wrap it in this.
- I know how to make a tourniquet, fool.

88
00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:52.235
I know it hurts,
but I had to make a point with you.

89
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.778
That ain't what's pissing me off.

90
00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:55.738
You shooting my van
is what's pissing me off, man.

91
00:07:55.822 --> 00:07:57.406
What's wrong with you?

92
00:08:01.823 --> 00:08:03.241
You Army Ranger, son?

93
00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:06.912
Be real careful
of what you say next, pops.

94
00:08:06.995 --> 00:08:09.706
And be ready to empty that burner
if you start shit-talking my battalion.

95
00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:23.428
Colonel Hannibal Smith.
75th Ranger Regiment.

96
00:08:23.512 --> 00:08:26.223
4th Battalion. Fort Benning, Georgia.

97
00:08:26.848 --> 00:08:29.685
I know who you are, sir.
Corporal B.A. Baracus.

98
00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:33.021
I mean, it was till I was dishonorably
discharged for some bullshit.

99
00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:38.402
I don't subscribe to coincidence, Corporal.

100
00:08:38.485 --> 00:08:41.363
I believe that, no matter how random
things might appear,

101
00:08:41.613 --> 00:08:42.614
there's still a plan.

102
00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:48.073


103
00:08:49.366 --> 00:08:51.451
<i>That here in the middle
of the Mexican desert,</i>

104
00:08:51.535 --> 00:08:53.286
when I needed him most,

105
00:08:53.495 --> 00:08:55.163
I'd find a fellow Ranger.

106
00:08:57.332 --> 00:08:59.167
Boy-

107
00:08:59.292 --> 00:09:01.169
Now, I need your help to save another.

108
00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:04.464
<i>Bad news for you today!</i>

109
00:09:04.548 --> 00:09:08.134
This rescue that's coming,
we fed him to the Rottweilers

110
00:09:08.218 --> 00:09:09.302
- about an hour ago.
- You know what's funny?

111
00:09:09.386 --> 00:09:12.097
Is that you actually believe
that you got me.

112
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.015
<i>You actually think
you're gonna kill me.</i>

113
00:09:14.182 --> 00:09:15.350
Can you drive?

114
00:09:15.934 --> 00:09:17.686
Better than anybody you've ever seen, sir.

115
00:09:21.356 --> 00:09:22.774


116
00:09:22.857 --> 00:09:25.902


117
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:28.822
<i>In a few minutes
I'm gonna be having a cold beer,</i>

118
00:09:29.698 --> 00:09:32.701
and you are gonna be on fire.
Take care, my friend.

119
00:09:33.868 --> 00:09:37.080
- Alpha, Mike...
- No!

120
00:09:38.331 --> 00:09:39.833
<i>Foxtrot.</i>

121
00:09:42.544 --> 00:09:43.795
Think about it.

122
00:09:47.382 --> 00:09:50.594
AdiÃ³s, mother...

123
00:10:05.984 --> 00:10:07.193
Hannibal!

124
00:10:09.654 --> 00:10:10.989
What are you doing?

125
00:10:17.412 --> 00:10:18.413
Get in!

126
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:20.915
B.A., move.

127
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.598
This is bullshit!

128
00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:41.102
<i>Ahora, muerto!</i>

129
00:10:42.312 --> 00:10:44.606
Stop it! Please stop!

130
00:10:44.773 --> 00:10:47.400
Please stop! Stop it! Stop! Please stop!

131
00:10:52.113 --> 00:10:54.282
How's your day going?

132
00:10:54.532 --> 00:10:57.035
This is not going to taste good.

133
00:11:07.794 --> 00:11:08.962
Baby, I just threw up.

134
00:11:09.129 --> 00:11:11.589
Let me get some gum.
Let me just get some gum.

135
00:11:11.673 --> 00:11:13.967
Did you see that?
Did you see Tuco's face?

136
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.136
When you came over,
that was unbelievable!

137
00:11:16.219 --> 00:11:17.554
- How many times did I say it?
- The timing was perfect.

138
00:11:17.637 --> 00:11:20.348
- How many times did I say it, Face?
- It was so beautiful.

139
00:11:20.473 --> 00:11:22.767
- I told you not to take down Tuco alone.
- What?

140
00:11:22.851 --> 00:11:24.352
Well, you...

141
00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:25.979
You know what? I'm sorry.

142
00:11:26.062 --> 00:11:30.066
<i>I'm</i> sorry I <i>didn't have
the Hannibal Smith How-to Manual.</i>

143
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.069
- Okay? I had to move.
- And that move snowballs, Face.

144
00:11:33.153 --> 00:11:35.030
You almost got yourself killed.

145
00:11:35.113 --> 00:11:36.656
Which almost got me killed
and almost got him killed.

146
00:11:44.914 --> 00:11:46.916
Thank you. Peck.

147
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.002
Baracus. It's all good.

148
00:11:49.377 --> 00:11:50.837
I was just trying to save her.

149
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.338
- Save her?
- Yeah.

150
00:11:52.464 --> 00:11:53.757
- Save her?
- Yeah.

151
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.135
How? Please, do share with us
your plan, Face.

152
00:11:59.888 --> 00:12:01.097
Okay, I hadn't thought about that yet.

153
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:03.433
Exactly. I had to.

154
00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:29.626
- Mike.
- Boss. How the hell are you?

155
00:12:29.709 --> 00:12:32.212
- Still chewing the same dirt?
- I am, unfortunately.

156
00:12:32.295 --> 00:12:34.506
- So what have you got for me?
- I got a fast bird doing pizza runs.

157
00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:36.800
- The call sign is "Hatchet."
- Hatchet. Okay.

158
00:12:36.883 --> 00:12:38.468
This is yours.

159
00:12:38.551 --> 00:12:40.929
And your pilot, if you wanna
call him that, is somewhere inside.

160
00:12:41.012 --> 00:12:42.972
- Be careful, boss.
- I owe you one, okay?

161
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:45.558
- Let's not wait till Bragg again, huh?
- Three years.

162
00:12:45.642 --> 00:12:47.894
How am I gonna just leave my girl
like this, after all that?

163
00:12:47.977 --> 00:12:49.187
I had to fight to get her back.

164
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.814
Leave the keys
and we'll come back for her.

165
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.910
Find a treatment room, Corporal.

166
00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:08.371
Make it quick. I'm gonna find our pilot.

167
00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:14.794
Hey.

168
00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:22.343
Hey, Doc, you got a second
for a wounded vet?

169
00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:27.223
<i>Highly decorated combat pilot.</i>

170
00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:29.892
You ask him,
he thinks he's the best in the world.

171
00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.978
But he's a functioning lunatic.

172
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.521
Last week he tried to escape
by jump-starting an ambulance.

173
00:13:35.096 --> 00:13:36.347
Clear.

174
00:13:36.514 --> 00:13:37.849
Damn it!

175
00:13:38.308 --> 00:13:39.601
My kind of guy.

176
00:13:43.104 --> 00:13:44.689
It almost hit your tattoo there.

177
00:13:44.772 --> 00:13:46.274
Has anyone seen Mr. Murdock?

178
00:13:46.357 --> 00:13:49.110
- The old Ranger tat.
- Mr. Murdock?

179
00:13:49.194 --> 00:13:52.822
Would you think I was crazy
if I told you I had one of these?

180
00:13:53.114 --> 00:13:54.866
Something wrong with your eyes, man.

181
00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:57.535
- Mr. Murdock?
- Not while I'm operating, nurse.

182
00:13:57.619 --> 00:13:59.412
- Not now.
- Why are you off the ward?

183
00:13:59.496 --> 00:14:01.789
Is that gas? Is that you?

184
00:14:01.873 --> 00:14:03.958
- I smell gas.
- What do you mean, "ward"?

185
00:14:04.042 --> 00:14:05.376
- What ward?
- This man is a patient here.

186
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.253
Is this you?
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.

187
00:14:07.337 --> 00:14:11.466
Honestly, I'm a practicing doctor
at Johns Hopkins University.

188
00:14:11.549 --> 00:14:14.093
- Did you ask him to do a lightning bolt?
- I asked for no lightning bolt.

189
00:14:14.636 --> 00:14:16.179
- I'm calling security.
- What's wrong with this fool?

190
00:14:16.262 --> 00:14:17.722
- Is he crazy?
- It is you.

191
00:14:17.805 --> 00:14:19.432
- You on fire, man.
- What? What's that?

192
00:14:19.516 --> 00:14:21.142
- What the...
- Oh, Jesus!

193
00:14:21.309 --> 00:14:23.520
- You Rangers. I like you!
- Are you crazy?

194
00:14:31.236 --> 00:14:32.987
Hey! Hey, come on!

195
00:14:34.489 --> 00:14:36.824
Corporal, off. Back off!

196
00:14:36.908 --> 00:14:38.409
This is a hospital.

197
00:14:39.577 --> 00:14:41.621
- Everybody's met Mr. Murdock.
- Met him?

198
00:14:41.704 --> 00:14:43.164
He lit my arm on fire.

199
00:14:43.873 --> 00:14:45.416
He stitched a lightning bolt in mine, man.

200
00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:47.502
Look at me, son.

201
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.089
I'm told you're a hell of a chopper pilot.

202
00:14:51.297 --> 00:14:52.340
The best, sir.

203
00:14:52.423 --> 00:14:53.800
I'm not getting on a chopper
with this nut job.

204
00:14:53.883 --> 00:14:55.927
Yeah, that's a good...
Is he another one of your projects?

205
00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.097
I'm a real soldier. I'm a Ranger, baby.

206
00:14:59.823 --> 00:15:00.949
I'm worried!

207
00:15:01.825 --> 00:15:03.327
I'm a Ranger, sir.

208
00:15:04.078 --> 00:15:05.079
That's good enough for me.

209
00:15:05.162 --> 00:15:06.538
You have been released into our care

210
00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:08.582
- and reinstated, Captain.
- I'm not even close to good with that.

211
00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:10.167
Thank you, sir.

212
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.877
Let's get the hell out of here.

213
00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:25.599
You gorgeous old rust bucket, you.

214
00:15:25.683 --> 00:15:27.059
Did you miss your daddy?

215
00:15:27.142 --> 00:15:30.229
Face, what's the most important part
of a well-oiled plan?

216
00:15:30.312 --> 00:15:31.605
To be one step ahead of the enemy,

217
00:15:31.689 --> 00:15:34.525
- not to be running away from him.
- Who says we're running?

218
00:15:34.692 --> 00:15:36.360
What, we're going to go in this dinosaur

219
00:15:36.485 --> 00:15:37.653
- with this freak show?
- Yep.

220
00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:41.281
<i>You spin me right round, baby
Right round.</i>

221
00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:44.201
- Rotors are good, sir.
- Who is this guy?

222
00:15:50.165 --> 00:15:51.417
Come on! Let's go!

223
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.876
We've got gringos to kill!

224
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.586
Murdock, get this thing in the air.

225
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.130
Hold on, boys!

226
00:15:56.213 --> 00:15:58.382
I'm gonna try something
I saw in a cartoon once.

227
00:15:58.507 --> 00:16:00.884
What you talking about cartoons for?
Get us the hell out of here!

228
00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:02.594
We got a hot chopper to your six.

229
00:16:04.471 --> 00:16:07.141
I'm blocking bullets.
We're bulletproof.

230
00:16:07.224 --> 00:16:08.892
We're bulletproof, boys!

231
00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:10.561
Oh, heads up.

232
00:16:19.778 --> 00:16:21.238
<i>I see you, gringo!</i>

233
00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:24.116
You pancaked my van!
I'm gonna kill you, fool!

234
00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:26.285
You can't park there.
That's a handicap zone.

235
00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:28.787
- I knew you was crazy! I knew...
- This is a mistake.

236
00:16:37.254 --> 00:16:38.630
Fire! Fire! Fire!

237
00:16:45.596 --> 00:16:46.805
Blow them out of the sky.

238
00:16:51.268 --> 00:16:53.312
I've never tried this before!

239
00:16:55.105 --> 00:16:56.190
Did you see that?

240
00:16:56.273 --> 00:16:58.442
Did you see
how he turned the helicopter?

241
00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:04.531
Whoa! There's nothing like some good
air-to-air combat, eh, boys?

242
00:17:04.615 --> 00:17:06.074
Don't look at me! Look there!

243
00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:09.870
He's only got heat seekers left.

244
00:17:09.953 --> 00:17:11.121
Captain, get us out of here.

245
00:17:11.455 --> 00:17:13.415
Hold on, this could get ugly!

246
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:16.001
Here we go! Come on, baby, climb!

247
00:17:24.593 --> 00:17:25.719
Fire the missiles.

248
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.181
Whoa! Missiles! Come on, come on.

249
00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:32.351
That's how we deal
with heat seekers, chaps.

250
00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:34.394
We go cold.

251
00:17:38.941 --> 00:17:39.942
What the hell?

252
00:17:40.067 --> 00:17:41.401
Face, get him in here!

253
00:17:41.902 --> 00:17:44.488
Holy, shit! Oh, shit!

254
00:17:44.822 --> 00:17:46.365
Got him!

255
00:17:46.615 --> 00:17:47.741
Restart. Restart.

256
00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.164
Close the door!

257
00:17:54.248 --> 00:17:56.834
I know you're Airborne Rangers,
but that was ridiculous!

258
00:17:58.335 --> 00:18:00.337
You're gonna be okay.

259
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.300
Boss, the idea is to kill Tuco,
not the other way around!

260
00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:08.178
One step ahead of the game
isn't a plan, kid.

261
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.557
Two to three steps ahead.

262
00:18:11.765 --> 00:18:14.226
Beating an enemy's move
before it's even made.

263
00:18:14.518 --> 00:18:16.061
That's a plan.

264
00:18:17.187 --> 00:18:18.981
Hatchet, Hatchet, lock on my IC.

265
00:18:19.481 --> 00:18:21.692
<i>General Tuco, you are currently engaged</i>

266
00:18:21.775 --> 00:18:25.320
in unauthorized warfare
on United States military personnel.

267
00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:27.865
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You engaged me.

268
00:18:28.365 --> 00:18:29.408
<i>Repeat.</i>

269
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:33.829
<i>You are engaged in unauthorized warfare
on United States military personnel.</i>

270
00:18:36.456 --> 00:18:39.042
Over United States air space.

271
00:18:39.835 --> 00:18:42.629
- What?
- Alpha, Mike...

272
00:18:42.796 --> 00:18:45.549
- Foxtrot!
- Foxtrot!

273
00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:50.304
- In other words, AdiÃ³s, mother...
- Oh, no.

274
00:18:55.726 --> 00:18:57.060
Yeah!

275
00:18:58.896 --> 00:19:00.314
Well done, Captain.

276
00:19:00.397 --> 00:19:02.190
- That was awesome.
- That wasn't awesome.

277
00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:04.860
- You are a genius!
- I'm never flying again in this thing!

278
00:19:05.027 --> 00:19:06.653
I never should have doubted you, boss!

279
00:19:06.737 --> 00:19:09.323
There's a plan in everything, kid.

280
00:19:09.406 --> 00:19:12.951
And I love it when a plan comes together.

281
00:19:40.103 --> 00:19:42.731
Gunpowder cooking.
Nothing like it.

282
00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:47.861
Face, you want it napalmed or nuked?

283
00:19:47.945 --> 00:19:49.363
Nuke it.

284
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.949
- Nuke it!
- Mmm-hmm.

285
00:19:55.702 --> 00:19:57.537
Murdock, burn the hell out of it,

286
00:19:59.247 --> 00:20:00.707
like it was damned.

287
00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:02.876
Burn the whole place down, buddy.

288
00:20:06.797 --> 00:20:10.384
- You want secret sauce?
- No, no, no. None of that anti-freeze.

289
00:20:10.467 --> 00:20:13.220
The secret's out. You crazy.
Everybody knows.

290
00:20:13.303 --> 00:20:16.181
No one can do an anti-freeze
marinade like you can, Murdock.

291
00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:19.393
But I got a little Bell's palsy
last time I ate that.

292
00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:21.895
It's only partial paralysis.
Come on, take it like a man.

293
00:20:21.979 --> 00:20:23.689
Yes, sir.
I'm having that conversation right now.

294
00:20:23.772 --> 00:20:25.649
We will enforce that.
I've got it well in hand, sir.

295
00:20:25.732 --> 00:20:29.152
I don't think you want me to be
in the field partially paralyzed, bud.

296
00:20:30.278 --> 00:20:31.738
Visitors.

297
00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:39.746
Yeah.

298
00:20:44.501 --> 00:20:47.087
Wow, I'm a little taken aback.
I'm not gonna lie.

299
00:20:47.504 --> 00:20:49.047
Lieutenant.

300
00:20:49.131 --> 00:20:51.049
Oh, I'm sorry, am I supposed
to call you Lieutenant back?

301
00:20:51.133 --> 00:20:52.676
No, you're supposed to call me Captain.

302
00:20:52.801 --> 00:20:54.636
Captain. Captain?

303
00:20:54.845 --> 00:20:56.179
That's right.

304
00:20:56.263 --> 00:20:58.974
Captain Crunch. Look at you. Wow.

305
00:20:59.057 --> 00:21:02.853
So, I guess you said no to the kids,
no to the family.

306
00:21:02.978 --> 00:21:04.730
Just no ladder you can't climb, huh?

307
00:21:04.813 --> 00:21:07.733
No, no, honey, I just said no to you.

308
00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.611
Hello. My name's Percy.

309
00:21:11.862 --> 00:21:14.072
Would you like some pork?

310
00:21:14.281 --> 00:21:16.616
If I broke every bone in your hand,
could you still do that?

311
00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.536
This is crazy. Three years?

312
00:21:20.328 --> 00:21:21.580
We haven't seen each other
for three years,

313
00:21:21.663 --> 00:21:23.790
this is what we're gonna talk about?

314
00:21:27.294 --> 00:21:28.795
What would you like to discuss?

315
00:21:31.548 --> 00:21:33.592
Did you take my Steely Dan CD?

316
00:21:34.051 --> 00:21:35.427
I'm not even going to respond to that.

317
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.596
We listened to it,
like, nine times in a row.

318
00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:40.891
We were drinking that crappy cabernet.
You remember that?

319
00:21:42.017 --> 00:21:43.894
We were doing something else.
What were we doing?

320
00:21:43.977 --> 00:21:46.980
Do you remember what it was
we were doing? It was in a bedroom.

321
00:21:47.189 --> 00:21:48.398
You don't remember?

322
00:21:48.482 --> 00:21:50.984
The only thing I remember is leaving.

323
00:21:51.109 --> 00:21:54.946
Which is my fondest memory of you.

324
00:21:59.576 --> 00:22:03.080
You guys are the best.
Stay out of trouble, you hear me?

325
00:22:04.539 --> 00:22:06.666
Take care. Yes. Thank you.

326
00:22:08.668 --> 00:22:10.170
Keep that on.

327
00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:22.307
Colonel, my name is Lynch,
I'm with Central Intelligence.

328
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.561
I knew a company man named Lynch
back in the first Desert Storm.

329
00:22:26.893 --> 00:22:29.021
Yeah, I come from a long line of Lynches.

330
00:22:29.563 --> 00:22:33.066
You ever stop to consider that maybe
the reason nobody trusts the CIA

331
00:22:33.275 --> 00:22:35.277
is because nobody knows your real names?

332
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.572
What can I do for you, Mr. Lynch?

333
00:22:38.864 --> 00:22:41.074
I need you to help me to stop
Saddam's former flunkies

334
00:22:41.158 --> 00:22:43.827
from stealing over a billion dollars
in the next 30 hours.

335
00:22:44.786 --> 00:22:48.123
Now, the only mint outside of the U.S.
capable of printing our money

336
00:22:48.206 --> 00:22:49.624
belonged to the Shah of Iran.

337
00:22:49.708 --> 00:22:51.710
<i>During the Iran-Iraq War, it went missing.</i>

338
00:22:51.835 --> 00:22:53.462
<i>Rumor was, Saddam had stolen it.</i>

339
00:22:53.587 --> 00:22:55.464
And we stole it back during Desert Storm.

340
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.841
Well, you didn't get the engraving plates.

341
00:22:59.384 --> 00:23:00.510
<i>It didn't matter.</i>

342
00:23:00.594 --> 00:23:03.889
<i>They would have had to rebuild a mint
just to print those bills.</i>

343
00:23:03.972 --> 00:23:05.474
<i>Well, sir,</i>

344
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.477
it's happening as we speak.

345
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.525
<i>Fedayeen thugs have seized
what's left of the Iraqi National Mint</i>

346
00:23:15.609 --> 00:23:18.904
<i>to run off billions of dollars
in unbacked American currency.</i>

347
00:23:19.154 --> 00:23:21.531
How are they planning on
moving the plates and a billion dollars

348
00:23:21.615 --> 00:23:23.867
- out of Baghdad?
- Armored convoy,

349
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.495
manned with former Iraqi spec ops.

350
00:23:26.828 --> 00:23:29.831
You know, high speed, shoot-to-kill types.

351
00:23:30.207 --> 00:23:32.209
So how do you plan on stopping them?

352
00:23:38.131 --> 00:23:40.967
Listen, there's some rumors
about some top-secret plates

353
00:23:41.051 --> 00:23:43.595
being smuggled out of the city
by Saddam loyalists.

354
00:23:43.845 --> 00:23:45.680
Do you know anything about this?

355
00:23:45.764 --> 00:23:48.725
Seriously, if you're going to make
a play for these plates,

356
00:23:48.892 --> 00:23:50.519
I'm waving you off right now.

357
00:23:50.644 --> 00:23:53.063
'Cause it's my responsibility
and it's my ass.

358
00:23:53.355 --> 00:23:54.898
I'm serious.

359
00:23:55.649 --> 00:23:56.775
- Face?
- Mmm-hmm.

360
00:23:56.858 --> 00:23:58.527
I will court-martial you.

361
00:23:59.027 --> 00:24:00.779
- Whoo! Okay.
- Hey.

362
00:24:01.488 --> 00:24:03.323
Get the memo.

363
00:24:03.407 --> 00:24:07.744
Tell your beloved Colonel Smith
and stay the hell out of Baghdad.

364
00:24:07.828 --> 00:24:09.329
You know,

365
00:24:10.205 --> 00:24:12.874
you never came back.
I thought you were gonna come back.

366
00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:15.252
Well, this is me, coming back.

367
00:24:23.716 --> 00:24:25.426
You think those clowns
can really pull this off?

368
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.553
Listen, listen, I would
never tell him this,

369
00:24:27.637 --> 00:24:30.723
but they are the best clandestine unit
in the four branches,

370
00:24:31.057 --> 00:24:32.892
and they specialize in the ridiculous.

371
00:24:33.685 --> 00:24:35.311
Shadow Peck and the rest of them.

372
00:24:35.395 --> 00:24:38.439
- Do not let them out of your sight.
- Yes, ma'am.

373
00:24:41.317 --> 00:24:43.403
- Doesn't <i>diablo</i> mean "devil"?
- Yeah, man.

374
00:24:45.196 --> 00:24:47.907
God damn it, Hannibal,
what do you want me to do?

375
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.159
If this were my operation
and you wanted it,

376
00:24:50.243 --> 00:24:53.371
- you would have the mission.
- You let Black Forest deploy on this,

377
00:24:53.454 --> 00:24:55.581
and it's an international incident,
I promise you.

378
00:24:55.665 --> 00:24:57.417
They're not soldiers.

379
00:24:57.583 --> 00:25:00.169
They're frat boys with trigger fingers.

380
00:25:00.253 --> 00:25:02.922
- Who's running the ground team?
- Brock Pike.

381
00:25:05.425 --> 00:25:06.467
Pike.

382
00:25:07.468 --> 00:25:10.221
He's a thug. He's a cartoon character.
Come on.

383
00:25:10.304 --> 00:25:14.267
Hannibal, we have been ordered,
ordered, mind you,

384
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.102
to stay out of Baghdad.

385
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.896
- Cut, dried, the end.
- General,

386
00:25:19.605 --> 00:25:22.191
we should find him
a little wiggle room, don't you think?

387
00:25:22.734 --> 00:25:26.446
You know, I knew another Lynch,
a CIA stooge.

388
00:25:26.654 --> 00:25:28.448
Stationed in Laos, '68.

389
00:25:30.338 --> 00:25:31.923
- No relation.
- Are you sure?

390
00:25:32.007 --> 00:25:33.383
'Cause you remind me of him.

391
00:25:35.927 --> 00:25:37.596
I'm due in Kabul in a few hours.

392
00:25:38.388 --> 00:25:41.766
I'll be back here in 48.
I'm assuming we're green and go.

393
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.685
Notify me otherwise.

394
00:25:43.935 --> 00:25:46.396
He's wearing body armor in the HQ.

395
00:25:47.939 --> 00:25:50.650
And that should tell you everything
you need to know about the CIA.

396
00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:04.205
Now, I want you to know
this is not about you losing a step.

397
00:26:04.623 --> 00:26:05.749
I want you to know that.

398
00:26:05.832 --> 00:26:07.083
- Hey.
- Hey.

399
00:26:07.167 --> 00:26:09.419
I'm 10 times the man I was
when you met me.

400
00:26:09.502 --> 00:26:11.463
- Uh-huh.
- And twice as fast.

401
00:26:12.172 --> 00:26:13.381
Russ,

402
00:26:14.132 --> 00:26:17.093
the boys and I can get this done,
minus the bloodshed.

403
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.512
Those plates can do all kinds of damage.

404
00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:21.056
Don't make me beg.

405
00:26:21.139 --> 00:26:23.099
I'd hate to see you beg, Hannibal.

406
00:26:25.727 --> 00:26:28.480
You've been my friend for a long time.

407
00:26:29.272 --> 00:26:30.899
More importantly,

408
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.027
you and those boys have possibly been

409
00:26:34.152 --> 00:26:38.531
the most valuable military asset
I have ever had at my disposal.

410
00:26:38.865 --> 00:26:42.160
Now, you asked me not to make you beg.

411
00:26:43.745 --> 00:26:45.997
Right now, I'm begging you-

412
00:26:46.498 --> 00:26:49.459
Hannibal, please, let this one go.

413
00:26:53.171 --> 00:26:57.509
Listen, B.A.,
we're extending our stay a little bit.

414
00:26:57.592 --> 00:26:58.968
We're going back into Baghdad.

415
00:26:59.052 --> 00:27:01.096
I thought we was ordered
to stay out of Baghdad.

416
00:27:01.179 --> 00:27:02.847
- That's true, but I'm...
- Smith.

417
00:27:04.391 --> 00:27:06.768
- Pike.
- I understand you and your grunts

418
00:27:06.851 --> 00:27:09.020
are now stealing my gigs.
I don't like that.

419
00:27:09.104 --> 00:27:12.273
I figured you Black Forest guys
would be busy

420
00:27:12.357 --> 00:27:15.527
installing a dictatorship
or overthrowing a democracy somewhere.

421
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.324
It's still the weekend, yet.
That's nine-to-five stuff, pops.

422
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.743
Look at you clowns.

423
00:27:23.827 --> 00:27:25.286
You're not soldiers.

424
00:27:25.912 --> 00:27:28.748
You're assassins in polo shirts.

425
00:27:30.875 --> 00:27:33.545
We'll make in a week
what you guys make in a year.

426
00:27:33.628 --> 00:27:35.380
Cash don't buy guts, kid,

427
00:27:36.798 --> 00:27:38.049
or brains.

428
00:27:38.258 --> 00:27:40.260
And you're short on both.

429
00:27:42.053 --> 00:27:45.682
This is Morrison's base. Bug out of my op.

430
00:27:46.266 --> 00:27:48.727
Let me see, we got one medium tank left.

431
00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.979
I'm telling you,
there's a reason she came back.

432
00:27:51.062 --> 00:27:53.356
Face, I told you, forget about her.

433
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.858
The levels of ambition on this woman...

434
00:27:54.941 --> 00:27:56.901
I ain't stepping foot
in any type of aircraft, Hannibal.

435
00:27:57.026 --> 00:28:00.113
No gliders, paper planes, ultra-lights.

436
00:28:00.196 --> 00:28:02.115
- You ever gonna let me live that down?
- No.

437
00:28:02.198 --> 00:28:05.201
Mexico was a long time ago,
and I saved your life.

438
00:28:05.285 --> 00:28:07.370
How about thanking me
for not whooping your ass at the hospital?

439
00:28:07.454 --> 00:28:08.955
I was an Airborne Ranger until I met you.

440
00:28:09.122 --> 00:28:10.623
And you chickened out just like...

441
00:28:10.707 --> 00:28:13.126
- 263 jumps.
- Just a thank-you would have been nice.

442
00:28:13.209 --> 00:28:15.253
And one helicopter ride with you
screws it up.

443
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.423
Airborne Ranger with a fear of flying.
Like a punk!

444
00:28:18.506 --> 00:28:21.342
B.A., for the last time,
nobody leaves the truck

445
00:28:21.426 --> 00:28:24.554
once we take it over. Okay?

446
00:28:25.513 --> 00:28:28.391
Staging, movement, action plan.

447
00:28:28.892 --> 00:28:30.435
There's a nice read for you.

448
00:28:30.684 --> 00:28:35.606
Hell, yeah, Hannibal.
This is it right here.

449
00:28:36.607 --> 00:28:38.692
This is bat-shit insane.

450
00:28:39.902 --> 00:28:43.071
- It's perfect.
- This is beyond nuts, boss.

451
00:28:47.743 --> 00:28:50.370
It gets better.

452
00:28:51.038 --> 00:28:54.499
<i>B.A., you'll need a piece
of contoured metal to make a skid plate.</i>

453
00:28:54.583 --> 00:28:55.626
Let's go, fool.

454
00:28:55.709 --> 00:28:58.253
<i>Murdock,
we'll need a car battery, too.</i>

455
00:28:58.378 --> 00:29:01.965
<i>See if the boys at Black Forest
can help us out.</i>

456
00:29:02.049 --> 00:29:03.675
<i>Press credentials, we need them.</i>

457
00:29:03.884 --> 00:29:06.261
<i>Hit the media tent
and see what's lying around.</i>

458
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:08.555
Sorry, my friend, I see you've put

459
00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:10.390
the South African microphone
at the bottom.

460
00:29:10.474 --> 00:29:12.601
You can't always put the CNN on top.

461
00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:14.895
Private, there are two mics.
I don't know if there is something...

462
00:29:16.063 --> 00:29:20.484
<i>I was a moving man in my younger days.</i>

463
00:29:20.567 --> 00:29:22.861
<i>Murdock, we need</i> a <i>news camera.</i>

464
00:29:22.945 --> 00:29:24.446
<i>See what you can do.</i>

465
00:29:27.074 --> 00:29:29.451
All right, sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

466
00:29:29.993 --> 00:29:32.120
Hello. I'm...

467
00:29:32.204 --> 00:29:34.122
I'm in love with you.

468
00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:35.749
Listen, we're doing a
preliminary poll of...

469
00:29:35.832 --> 00:29:38.126
What are we talking about?
Of the pull-out.

470
00:29:38.919 --> 00:29:42.130
<i>We're gonna need airbags,
lots of them.</i>

471
00:29:42.214 --> 00:29:44.549
- What bureau are you with, darling?
- Le Monde.

472
00:29:44.633 --> 00:29:46.051
Are you French?

473
00:29:52.057 --> 00:29:53.684
<i>Hello, this is General Parker. I need...</i>

474
00:29:53.767 --> 00:29:54.851
Okay. It's for you.

475
00:29:54.935 --> 00:29:57.604
Hey, fool, you need to call
an air strike on yourself.

476
00:29:59.398 --> 00:30:02.234
- We're good, mate. I'll meet you.
- No, I think we need to get going now.

477
00:30:02.317 --> 00:30:05.487
You need to understand
what I'm telling you right now.

478
00:30:05.612 --> 00:30:08.073
<i>B.A., we're gonna need a magnet.</i>

479
00:30:08.156 --> 00:30:10.158
<i>- Yeah!
- A powerful one.</i>

480
00:30:13.954 --> 00:30:15.497
You ever seen Blue Man Group?

481
00:30:17.457 --> 00:30:19.001
<i>I'll pick up the rest.</i>

482
00:30:29.344 --> 00:30:30.846
I'm just gonna go for it.

483
00:30:34.683 --> 00:30:36.101
Ooh, la, la.

484
00:30:36.184 --> 00:30:38.854
<i>What would you give for one chance</i>

485
00:30:39.021 --> 00:30:42.524
to come back here and tell our enemies

486
00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:45.193
that they may take our lives,

487
00:30:45.277 --> 00:30:49.364
but they'll never take our freedom!

488
00:30:57.237 --> 00:30:58.363
Ready to go downtown?

489
00:30:58.905 --> 00:31:00.740
Good luck tomorrow.

490
00:31:01.116 --> 00:31:03.118
- Thank you.
- Give 'em hell.

491
00:31:08.081 --> 00:31:11.209
General Morrison,
where is Hannibal Smith?

492
00:31:11.751 --> 00:31:13.795
<i>They go mobile in three hours.</i>

493
00:31:15.797 --> 00:31:17.674
<i>The plates and over a billion dollars</i>

494
00:31:17.757 --> 00:31:21.511
<i>will be loaded into the back of a semi
at the mint.</i>

495
00:31:21.881 --> 00:31:26.052
They're overland for exactly
4.6 miles before they reach the bridge.

496
00:31:30.306 --> 00:31:33.476
That's our window, and it closes fast.

497
00:31:37.272 --> 00:31:40.275
These guys will go weapons hot
at the first whisper of trouble.

498
00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:49.449
Face, your point of entry
is under the hotel.

499
00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:53.787
<i>It'll be packed with foreign press
and private security.</i>

500
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:15.517
B.A., you're in this alleyway
on a stopwatch.

501
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.103
<i>Make sure the bike has V-twins or better.</i>

502
00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:20.480
<i>BA; I got something
a whole lot better than that.</i>

503
00:32:21.815 --> 00:32:23.984
- Bam!
- What about me, boss man?

504
00:32:25.986 --> 00:32:28.488
I had a little
helicopter here someplace.

505
00:32:28.697 --> 00:32:32.534
You got some barrel rolls?
Some mid-air stalls?

506
00:32:32.701 --> 00:32:36.913
I'm looking for my next
near-death experience.

507
00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:38.915
Only air support this time,
Captain,

508
00:32:38.999 --> 00:32:41.418
but I'll get you in on the next one.
I promise.

509
00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:46.006
B.A., I need you
to pop that clutch at 0630.

510
00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:50.343
Is that me?

511
00:32:50.427 --> 00:32:54.055
Oh, no, I forgot. I'm in an Iraqi sewer.
Thanks, boss!

512
00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:01.021
Timing is everything, Face.

513
00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:05.191
<i>This is all about the bull's-eyes.</i>

514
00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:12.907
Why not?

515
00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:19.289
From under the semi, you'll
take out the truck directly behind you.

516
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:30.091
Huh?

517
00:33:32.052 --> 00:33:34.512
Now, these guys
are gonna be onto you, Face.

518
00:33:34.596 --> 00:33:36.348
B.A., that's your cue for throttle.

519
00:33:37.599 --> 00:33:39.476
Be sure to look both ways
before crossing.

520
00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:41.561
And have a nice full tank of gas.

521
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:55.575
<i>You'll have
multiple hostiles on board, B.A.</i>

522
00:33:58.203 --> 00:34:00.163
<i>Escort them from the premises.</i>

523
00:34:18.598 --> 00:34:22.477
If any stragglers sneak up behind,
don't worry, I got your back.

524
00:34:35.313 --> 00:34:36.398
Gotcha, kid.

525
00:34:37.482 --> 00:34:38.650
Atta boy.

526
00:34:39.484 --> 00:34:44.155
That's all fine in theory, but I still
don't see how we get out of Baghdad.

527
00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:45.240
I do.

528
00:34:45.323 --> 00:34:47.283
B.A.! Hang a right!

529
00:34:47.617 --> 00:34:49.619
All right! Hang on!

530
00:34:55.208 --> 00:34:57.127
- Watch out! Watch out!
- Heads down!

531
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.547
Oh! Nice one, B.A.!

532
00:35:02.966 --> 00:35:04.884
Face, get the airbags!

533
00:35:05.218 --> 00:35:08.346
Gotta make sure
this thing stays locked for later!

534
00:35:08.972 --> 00:35:09.973
Beautiful!

535
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.809
One, two, three.

536
00:35:18.022 --> 00:35:21.151
Hey, boss, airbags do deploy
on impact, right?

537
00:35:22.861 --> 00:35:24.821
B.A., get in the container.

538
00:35:27.115 --> 00:35:28.366
Contact, rear!

539
00:35:28.825 --> 00:35:29.951
Shit!

540
00:35:47.552 --> 00:35:49.762
See, this is the part of the plan
I don't trust!

541
00:35:49.888 --> 00:35:52.265
Don't worry, Face! The rope will hold!

542
00:35:52.348 --> 00:35:55.351
If I was worried, I'd be nailing myself
to the container right now!

543
00:35:55.685 --> 00:35:57.187
Hang on, boys!

544
00:36:17.066 --> 00:36:19.193
Bam! Come on! I smoked you!

545
00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:20.862
<i>You boys see that down there?</i>

546
00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:23.197
Murdock? What is that fool doing here?

547
00:36:23.406 --> 00:36:25.199
Don't lock me in here.
I ain't playing with y'all!

548
00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:27.493
<i>Hey, boss, you
ever play that game at the fun fair</i>

549
00:36:27.577 --> 00:36:29.787
<i>where you try to pick up
a stuffed animal with the claw?</i>

550
00:36:30.663 --> 00:36:32.290
This is a lot like that.

551
00:36:32.874 --> 00:36:34.375
That's it!

552
00:36:35.042 --> 00:36:36.210
Did you lock this?

553
00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:37.670
You locked it, didn't you?

554
00:36:37.753 --> 00:36:39.463
Hannibal, open this door right now, man!

555
00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:41.799
What the... Are you hooking this thing?

556
00:36:42.091 --> 00:36:43.885
- You hooking this up to a helicopter?
- I got you.

557
00:36:43.968 --> 00:36:46.053
What the hell's going on?
You ain't that crazy!

558
00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:48.306
Tell me we ain't flying!
I'm gonna kill you, fool!

559
00:36:48.389 --> 00:36:51.309
- Boss, is that Bosco?
- Get me out of here!

560
00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:53.311
<i>That's not good.
Let me out of here!</i>

561
00:36:53.394 --> 00:36:56.314
<i>That's not good.
He is not happy.</i>

562
00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:19.921
<i>Russ, we are in the net.</i>

563
00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:23.132
Copy that. I will be there in five.

564
00:37:23.216 --> 00:37:25.551
I've got a big bottle
of Blue Label waiting.

565
00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:28.429
A bottle? Make it a case, Scrooge.

566
00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:30.014
See you in a few.

567
00:37:30.097 --> 00:37:32.183
Who's gonna let him out?

568
00:37:32.683 --> 00:37:33.684
- You!
- You!

569
00:37:33.768 --> 00:37:37.355
What you don't realize is,
now I gotta kill all of y'all!

570
00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:41.025
I'll kill all of y'all!
Hannibal first, then Murdock!

571
00:37:41.108 --> 00:37:42.985
- Boss man.
- I'm gonna save Face for last!

572
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:44.820
- Let me try something.
- Go for it.

573
00:37:44.904 --> 00:37:47.281
Is it weird that I'm more scared now
than what we just did?

574
00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:49.575
Bosco, it's Murdock.

575
00:37:49.659 --> 00:37:51.369
Murdock, open this door!

576
00:37:51.953 --> 00:37:54.914
I'll make you some of that
coconut-curry tapenade that you love.

577
00:37:54.997 --> 00:37:56.666
That might work.

578
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.627
With toast points?

579
00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.796
Hell, yeah, with toast points.
What, you're gonna have that

580
00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:03.547
- with plain old chips?
- Let's do this.

581
00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.634
- Damn! You tricked me.
- There he is.

582
00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:08.302
- There he is!
- I hate that!

583
00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:10.471
- Come on!
- Get away from me, man!

584
00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:13.307
The only reason I don't kick y'all asses
is 'cause you all outrank me.

585
00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:15.226
You should know better!
You know I hate flying!

586
00:38:15.434 --> 00:38:17.478
- I'm wet! I stink!
- Hoo! Yeah!

587
00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:18.980
And I can't spend none of that money!

588
00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:20.982
Money can't buy happiness.
Damn, man!

589
00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:24.360
Hey, Murdock, you cooking tonight.
You better get your apron on.

590
00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:29.615
I love it when a plan comes together.

591
00:38:36.789 --> 00:38:37.957
- Hannibal, who was that?
- General?

592
00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.333
- Is that the General?
- Russ.

593
00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.919
- Get there. Get in there.
- General!

594
00:38:42.336 --> 00:38:44.005
- Russ!
- General!

595
00:38:44.338 --> 00:38:45.715
General!

596
00:38:45.798 --> 00:38:47.300
Jesus Christ.

597
00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:54.598
Pike.

598
00:38:54.682 --> 00:38:56.225
Contact rear!

599
00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:58.519
Get in there!

600
00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.442
Get there, get there!

601
00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:50.738
<i>After conferring,
we've decided to demote you</i>

602
00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:53.324
<i>to the rank of First Lieutenant.</i>

603
00:39:53.783 --> 00:39:56.160
Lieutenant Sosa,
it's nothing personal,

604
00:39:56.285 --> 00:39:57.953
but you lost those plates.

605
00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.081
Those were your responsibility.

606
00:40:00.456 --> 00:40:01.916
Consider yourself lucky.

607
00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:03.376
Others are going to prison over this.

608
00:40:03.459 --> 00:40:04.919
Good day, Director McCready.

609
00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:06.879
Lieutenant, you're dismissed.

610
00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:10.424
<i>Colonel Smith,
this court has been unable to recover</i>

611
00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:14.845
<i>any direct order from General Morrison
for you to conduct the mission</i>

612
00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:16.931
<i>for which you're being tried.</i>

613
00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:20.351
<i>Your Honor,
this was</i> a <i>covert operation</i>

614
00:40:20.518 --> 00:40:22.853
<i>and no official orders were given.</i>

615
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:26.472
So the one individual who can verify

616
00:40:26.556 --> 00:40:29.309
<i>the legitimacy of this operation
is deceased. Is that correct, Colonel?</i>

617
00:40:29.434 --> 00:40:31.436
<i>No, Your Honor, not deceased.</i>

618
00:40:31.936 --> 00:40:33.730
<i>General Morrison was murdered.</i>

619
00:40:33.813 --> 00:40:36.316
Colonel, I've been around a long time.

620
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:40.320
I've seen units like yours.
They're outlaws.

621
00:40:40.403 --> 00:40:43.072
Units like that pose a direct threat

622
00:40:43.489 --> 00:40:45.617
<i>to the fabric and fundamentals
of our military.</i>

623
00:40:47.452 --> 00:40:50.872
Your Honors, why hasn't Black Forest
been brought to trial?

624
00:40:51.372 --> 00:40:55.835
Black Forest and its personnel are
not subject to military jurisdiction.

625
00:40:57.712 --> 00:40:59.380
<i>Where's the plan, boss? Where is it?</i>

626
00:40:59.464 --> 00:41:01.299
<i>Where's the escape hatch?
Because I don't see it.</i>

627
00:41:01.382 --> 00:41:03.885
- This mission isn't over, Lieutenant.
- What mission?

628
00:41:04.886 --> 00:41:08.765
I clear our names.
We find Pike and the plates.

629
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.725
No matter what.

630
00:41:12.602 --> 00:41:15.897
<i>Your Honors, these men were acting
under my command.</i>

631
00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.775
Any judgment should be levied
against me, and me alone.

632
00:41:18.858 --> 00:41:20.026
Absolutely not, sir.

633
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:22.278
We were all participating
in this operation willingly.

634
00:41:22.362 --> 00:41:23.529
I don't wanna be tried separately.

635
00:41:23.613 --> 00:41:25.198
I refuse to be tried separately, sir.

636
00:41:26.074 --> 00:41:28.451
In accordance with
the Uniform Code of Military Justice,

637
00:41:28.534 --> 00:41:30.328
this court is rendering guilty verdicts

638
00:41:30.411 --> 00:41:32.830
for each member of this Alpha Unit,
or A-Team,

639
00:41:32.914 --> 00:41:36.542
and mandating incarceration
in separate maximum-security facilities

640
00:41:37.877 --> 00:41:39.712
<i>for</i> a <i>period of up to 10 years.</i>

641
00:41:39.796 --> 00:41:43.341
You're all hereby stripped of formal rank

642
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:45.718
and dishonorably discharged.

643
00:41:49.555 --> 00:41:50.932
This is bullshit, man.

644
00:41:51.599 --> 00:41:53.726
This session is adjourned.

645
00:41:59.232 --> 00:42:00.274
Disgraceful.

646
00:42:00.566 --> 00:42:02.568
- Do not touch me, okay?
- Captain, stand down.

647
00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:04.195
Order! Order!

648
00:42:05.029 --> 00:42:06.489
Absolute disgrace!

649
00:42:06.572 --> 00:42:08.741
You happy? Are you happy, Charissa?

650
00:42:08.991 --> 00:42:10.410
Colonel, control your men!

651
00:42:10.993 --> 00:42:13.413
- Get your hands off me!
- This is a disgrace!

652
00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.938
Well, hello, Mr. Lynch.
Long time.

653
00:42:40.606 --> 00:42:42.442
You look very relaxed, Lynch.

654
00:42:42.525 --> 00:42:44.026
A lot of cameras in here.

655
00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:45.820
Yeah, there are.

656
00:42:46.446 --> 00:42:49.574
Yeah, well, they seem to be having
some technical issues at the moment.

657
00:42:49.866 --> 00:42:52.201
May not show up till playback.

658
00:42:52.952 --> 00:42:54.454
Hannibal. Can I call you Hannibal?

659
00:42:55.538 --> 00:42:57.874
I can't call you Colonel anymore.

660
00:42:57.957 --> 00:42:59.459
Six months.

661
00:42:59.709 --> 00:43:02.920
Been waiting for you to bust out of here

662
00:43:03.004 --> 00:43:06.007
and round up the rest
of the Backstreet Boys

663
00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:07.550
and lead me to those plates.

664
00:43:08.468 --> 00:43:10.553
Six months and not a peep.

665
00:43:10.887 --> 00:43:13.514
Everybody thought you and your team
were working with Pike.

666
00:43:13.639 --> 00:43:16.225
Mmm. Everybody except you.

667
00:43:18.603 --> 00:43:23.524
Pike murdered Morrison. Set me
and my boys up and stole those plates.

668
00:43:29.113 --> 00:43:30.865
And I know where he is.

669
00:43:32.617 --> 00:43:34.702
Nobody knows where he is.

670
00:43:39.248 --> 00:43:40.416
It's a single image of him.

671
00:43:41.459 --> 00:43:44.086
Taken about a month ago,
somewhere in Europe.

672
00:43:44.587 --> 00:43:47.673
We think it's a grab from a CCTV camera.

673
00:43:49.509 --> 00:43:51.636
Frankfurt, Germany.

674
00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.973
How did you get that in here?

675
00:43:56.057 --> 00:43:57.850
Time, Lynch.

676
00:43:58.518 --> 00:44:00.144
Give me a minute and I'm good.

677
00:44:00.269 --> 00:44:02.104
If I've got an hour, I'm great.

678
00:44:02.188 --> 00:44:05.358
You give me six months, I'm unbeatable.

679
00:44:06.025 --> 00:44:07.026
I know Pike.

680
00:44:07.276 --> 00:44:08.319
Who's the Arab?

681
00:44:08.945 --> 00:44:10.446
We don't know.

682
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:13.616
We think he's the deep, dark,
hidden hand in this whole thing.

683
00:44:14.033 --> 00:44:16.536
Maybe a broker, maybe a buyer.

684
00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:21.874
Lynch, we have common
enemies and you have limited choices.

685
00:44:21.958 --> 00:44:24.585
My team is still your best shot
at getting those plates back.

686
00:44:24.669 --> 00:44:25.920
I wouldn't be so sure.

687
00:44:26.003 --> 00:44:28.422
Then why did you make
the long drive out here?

688
00:44:28.506 --> 00:44:31.300
You and your boys at Langley
want your own private printing press.

689
00:44:31.884 --> 00:44:34.887
That's about as deep
as your patriotism goes.

690
00:44:35.388 --> 00:44:37.431
So, what would you need from me?

691
00:44:38.015 --> 00:44:40.476
I swore to my team
that I would clear our names.

692
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.396
You of all people must understand
the value of a name.

693
00:44:47.066 --> 00:44:48.067
Now, listen.

694
00:44:49.402 --> 00:44:53.281
I want full reinstatement
and clean records

695
00:44:53.531 --> 00:44:56.033
for myself and my team.

696
00:44:56.242 --> 00:44:58.369
I can't get you out of here.

697
00:44:59.036 --> 00:45:01.330
Not legally, at least.

698
00:45:02.623 --> 00:45:06.043
This is something the boys at Langley
do very, very well.

699
00:45:06.127 --> 00:45:07.795
Make sure the dosage is right.

700
00:45:09.088 --> 00:45:12.049
And when I say right, I mean perfect.

701
00:45:13.926 --> 00:45:17.889
<i>Don't seem like happiness will come along</i>

702
00:45:20.141 --> 00:45:23.227
Cuban. What a shame.

703
00:45:24.562 --> 00:45:29.150
<i>Everybody's throwing rocks in my bed.</i>

704
00:45:30.943 --> 00:45:33.863
<i>Just can't seem to get ahead in life.</i>

705
00:45:33.946 --> 00:45:40.453
<i>Ooh, nothing I do ever turn out right.</i>

706
00:45:42.288 --> 00:45:44.707
<i>Won't somebody help me, please?</i>

707
00:45:45.917 --> 00:45:50.796
<i>'Cause I've been lonely for so long.</i>

708
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.592
<i>Don't seem like happiness will come along.</i>

709
00:45:55.801 --> 00:45:58.429
<i>I've been lonely...</i>

710
00:46:13.444 --> 00:46:16.906
You are not permitted

711
00:46:16.989 --> 00:46:20.326
in my dojo!

712
00:46:24.163 --> 00:46:26.916
So, Satan walks into this bar...

713
00:46:29.537 --> 00:46:32.039
Wait a minute.
What's this, a lap pool?

714
00:46:32.123 --> 00:46:33.499
A dry steam room?

715
00:46:33.582 --> 00:46:36.127
Yeah, it'll go a long way with the boys.

716
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:39.046
How in the hell do you pull this off?

717
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.632
It's not who you know, Bob,
it's how you know them.

718
00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:44.260
Oh! Did your boy get back
from Afghanistan?

719
00:46:44.343 --> 00:46:47.304
Yeah. Thanks for getting him home.
His mother and I are real grateful.

720
00:46:48.514 --> 00:46:50.224
- Captain.
- Hey.

721
00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:52.101
You left something on the bed.

722
00:46:55.896 --> 00:46:58.607
- Could have hid those.
- Why would I want to do that?

723
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.235
You drive me crazy. I'll see you at 8:00.

724
00:47:01.569 --> 00:47:02.820
Hey, LT, thanks for the boots.

725
00:47:02.903 --> 00:47:05.531
Ah! Come on. It's my pleasure, baby!

726
00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:12.997
Smith has escaped, Lieutenant.

727
00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:16.375
Let me go after him.

728
00:47:16.459 --> 00:47:19.211
Smith and his team were working
with Brock Pike and Black Forest.

729
00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.547
I can get those plates back for you, sir.

730
00:47:23.007 --> 00:47:24.592
You know I can.

731
00:47:24.759 --> 00:47:26.844
Holla what? Holla who?

732
00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:30.431
Holla me.

733
00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:35.227
Hey.

734
00:47:35.436 --> 00:47:39.482
Hey! Let me out! Hey, hey! Hey!

735
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.831
You are really tan.

736
00:47:58.959 --> 00:48:00.795
Seal that up, nobody goes in there.

737
00:48:03.088 --> 00:48:05.841
Log-in pages from the day in question
have been removed.

738
00:48:05.925 --> 00:48:08.385
- Why does that not surprise me?
- Torn out.

739
00:48:08.469 --> 00:48:11.430
The cigar was in the spine of that book.

740
00:48:12.181 --> 00:48:13.891
- Subtle.
- Now, get this.

741
00:48:13.974 --> 00:48:16.811
This is surveillance
from all around the prison, right?

742
00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:17.937
Mmm-hmm.

743
00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.855
What you're watching is a signal jammer.

744
00:48:19.939 --> 00:48:22.900
It's high tech stuff. It sends a
jamming signal in front of every camera.

745
00:48:22.983 --> 00:48:25.611
Every time we might get
a glimpse of him, we see nothing.

746
00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:27.488
Nobody knows who he is.

747
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:29.281
Which begs a bigger question.

748
00:48:29.365 --> 00:48:31.325
Did the CIA visit Smith in prison?

749
00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:34.495
This sounds kind of crazy,
but I think the CIA broke him out.

750
00:48:35.204 --> 00:48:36.664
Who put us on?

751
00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:40.334
The same guy that put us on in Baghdad.
Lynch, CIA.

752
00:48:40.835 --> 00:48:44.380
What are we talking about?
Clean records? Reinstatements?

753
00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:46.340
All of the above.

754
00:48:46.465 --> 00:48:49.426
What about Pike and the plates?

755
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:51.512
Payback.

756
00:48:52.513 --> 00:48:54.431
I take it you didn't get religion inside.

757
00:48:54.515 --> 00:48:57.351
No. I got revenge.

758
00:48:58.269 --> 00:48:59.812
Good.

759
00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:04.191
I know a couple of guys
that'll feel the exact same way.

760
00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:06.151
I'm counting on it.

761
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.470
Emergency exit now.

762
00:49:35.471 --> 00:49:36.931
Hannibal.

763
00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.154
Baracus, don't do it!

764
00:49:52.905 --> 00:49:55.033
Where he going?
What's he doing, man?

765
00:49:56.451 --> 00:49:57.952
Baracus! God damn it!

766
00:50:05.449 --> 00:50:06.450
Sosa.

767
00:50:06.575 --> 00:50:08.369
<i>So Baracus and Peck
are already gone.</i>

768
00:50:08.452 --> 00:50:10.663
- What? <i>Shit.
- Murdock's the only one left,</i>

769
00:50:10.746 --> 00:50:12.164
<i>- and he's in Germany.
- Right.</i>

770
00:50:23.634 --> 00:50:25.553
How did you know that once that door
was extracted

771
00:50:25.636 --> 00:50:27.680
- that it would take his weight?
- I just did. He's...

772
00:50:27.763 --> 00:50:30.349
- You know, he's what, 225, 230 pounds?
- 230. Yeah.

773
00:50:30.766 --> 00:50:33.060
Remember the gag we did in Venezuela
seven years ago?

774
00:50:33.144 --> 00:50:35.312
Venezuela. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

775
00:50:35.729 --> 00:50:37.106
But that was a midget.

776
00:50:38.107 --> 00:50:39.650
Yeah, I wouldn't go for that.

777
00:50:39.733 --> 00:50:41.819
- Hey, big guy. There he is.
- Yeah! He's back.

778
00:50:41.902 --> 00:50:43.696
- Yeah, it's good to be back.
- Come on.

779
00:50:44.113 --> 00:50:45.406
- It's good to be back.
- My man.

780
00:50:45.489 --> 00:50:47.408
- It's good to see you, bud.
- You, too, bro. You, too.

781
00:50:48.451 --> 00:50:49.869
- Thanks.
- You look well.

782
00:50:49.952 --> 00:50:51.829
It's good to see you guys.

783
00:50:56.459 --> 00:50:57.960
- What?
- Where's the Mohawk?

784
00:50:58.627 --> 00:51:00.671
What, you don't like my new do, man?

785
00:51:01.797 --> 00:51:04.341
Do I like it? Well, we got
you the clippers. I thought...

786
00:51:04.425 --> 00:51:06.177
Yeah, I used them.

787
00:51:08.262 --> 00:51:10.556
Hey. What's up, big guy?

788
00:51:13.142 --> 00:51:14.727
Come on, you can speak to us.

789
00:51:15.853 --> 00:51:17.146
Guys...

790
00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:21.567
I can't kill anybody.

791
00:51:24.195 --> 00:51:27.823
- What do you mean?
- I've taken a vow.

792
00:51:28.157 --> 00:51:30.159
- Vow?
- Of non-violence.

793
00:51:30.367 --> 00:51:33.496
I'll still do anything for you guys,
you know that.

794
00:51:34.622 --> 00:51:36.832
But I just can't kill, man.

795
00:51:37.249 --> 00:51:39.376
Old habits may die hard,

796
00:51:40.794 --> 00:51:42.630
but they still gotta die.

797
00:51:43.506 --> 00:51:46.759
When I was a kid,
all you heard in the hood was,

798
00:51:46.842 --> 00:51:50.679
"Bosco's a badass, out collecting scalps."

799
00:51:52.431 --> 00:51:54.391
That's where the Mohawk came from.

800
00:51:55.684 --> 00:51:57.353
Was always at war.

801
00:51:57.853 --> 00:51:59.563
And that's what warriors are for.

802
00:51:59.897 --> 00:52:02.525
Hannibal, man. I don't miss that life.

803
00:52:02.816 --> 00:52:06.111
I'll help you get Murdock,
and right that wrong,

804
00:52:07.446 --> 00:52:09.657
- but I can't kill.
- Even Pike?

805
00:52:10.241 --> 00:52:12.201
Even if killing him would clear your name?

806
00:52:13.869 --> 00:52:16.747
My conscience is the only thing
I need clear.

807
00:52:16.872 --> 00:52:20.334
Now, where's that crazy-ass fool?

808
00:52:31.554 --> 00:52:35.766
Hey, Murdock,
you got a package from Annabelle Smith.

809
00:52:40.938 --> 00:52:42.856
Ooh! A movie in three dimensions.

810
00:52:43.357 --> 00:52:44.942
It's so real.

811
00:52:45.025 --> 00:52:47.236
Movie, movie, movie...

812
00:52:47.319 --> 00:52:49.154
I knight you.

813
00:52:49.238 --> 00:52:51.532
Sir, you have to put your head down.
Stand up and do it again.

814
00:52:52.741 --> 00:52:54.743
When you kneel,
you put your head down straightaway.

815
00:52:54.827 --> 00:52:56.579
Looking me in the eye is disrespectful.
Do you understand?

816
00:52:56.662 --> 00:52:58.080
Movie, movie...

817
00:52:58.330 --> 00:52:59.665
You're looking me in the eye now.
That's wrong.

818
00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:03.919
Movie, movie, movie...

819
00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:09.008
- Movie! Movie!
- Movie! Movie!

820
00:53:09.091 --> 00:53:11.844
Movie...

821
00:53:14.263 --> 00:53:15.889
Excuse me,
can I help you with something?

822
00:53:16.056 --> 00:53:18.475
Yes. Captain Murdock, where is he?

823
00:53:18.601 --> 00:53:20.978
- Right through there.
- Thank you.

824
00:53:21.103 --> 00:53:22.605
<i>El diablo.</i>

825
00:53:23.939 --> 00:53:25.733
Okay. Settle down.

826
00:53:25.816 --> 00:53:27.192
No talking during the movie.

827
00:53:29.236 --> 00:53:30.904
Down in front!

828
00:53:34.783 --> 00:53:36.493
Look, it's 3D, man!

829
00:53:36.576 --> 00:53:38.245
I'm sick Of 3D.

830
00:53:39.371 --> 00:53:40.789
Captain Murdock.

831
00:53:41.456 --> 00:53:43.667
You remember me from Baghdad?

832
00:53:51.091 --> 00:53:53.093
Okay, this is pointless.
This guy is fried.

833
00:53:53.176 --> 00:53:54.469
Yeah, there's a reason
why he's in here.

834
00:53:54.553 --> 00:53:56.805
And his entire team has escaped,
except him.

835
00:53:57.973 --> 00:53:59.683
Movie!

836
00:53:59.849 --> 00:54:02.519
Take a look around anyway.
Let's make sure he's alone.

837
00:54:02.602 --> 00:54:04.437
Yes, ma'am.

838
00:54:33.592 --> 00:54:35.677
Oh, Captain, your chariot awaits.

839
00:54:36.052 --> 00:54:38.054
Sorry, boys, gotta run!
Can't finish the movie.

840
00:54:38.138 --> 00:54:39.472
Do let me know how it ends.

841
00:54:39.556 --> 00:54:41.641
Charissa, where are you hiding?
Stay beautiful, baby.

842
00:54:41.766 --> 00:54:43.727
Punch it, B.A. Let's go, fool.

843
00:54:46.938 --> 00:54:47.981
Get the truck!

844
00:54:49.941 --> 00:54:51.359
She's actually shooting at us.

845
00:54:51.443 --> 00:54:52.986
You guys should see these bullets in 3D!

846
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:54.571
- Murdock, get in here!
- It's like we're actually being shot at!

847
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:57.277
You are getting shot
at, you crazy-ass fool!

848
00:54:59.822 --> 00:55:01.073
- Stop right there!
- Ram it.

849
00:55:01.156 --> 00:55:02.616
Hey! I said halt!

850
00:55:06.453 --> 00:55:07.830
Damn! Sorry, dude.

851
00:55:08.747 --> 00:55:10.582
It looks like they're
headed for the tarmac.

852
00:55:10.749 --> 00:55:12.418
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

853
00:55:17.631 --> 00:55:20.509
- Gentlemen.
- Holy shit, that's Hannibal Smith.

854
00:55:20.592 --> 00:55:24.179
Are any of you armed
and/or wanted federal fugitives?

855
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:27.266
- No.
- Well, we're both.

856
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:28.809
- Which means...
- This is a bad idea.

857
00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:30.227
This is a bad idea.

858
00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:32.312
Stop being a baby.
You're a grown-ass man. Get on the plane.

859
00:55:32.438 --> 00:55:35.024
- You're taking the plane?
- And that's why I joined the Army.

860
00:55:35.107 --> 00:55:37.151
We gotta finish the escape.
Man up and get in there.

861
00:55:37.359 --> 00:55:40.487
The best and brightest.
Appreciate it, boys. That'll be all.

862
00:55:40.571 --> 00:55:42.239
Who's got the keys?
I just need your keys.

863
00:55:42.322 --> 00:55:44.408
What you talking about keys?
You don't need no keys for no plane.

864
00:55:44.491 --> 00:55:46.952
I do need keys.
For what? This is a bad idea.

865
00:55:47.036 --> 00:55:48.704
We just broke
this guy out of a psych ward.

866
00:55:48.787 --> 00:55:50.539
Hannibal, you let the real pilots go.

867
00:55:50.622 --> 00:55:52.332
- B.A., relax. You're gonna be fine.
- Take one of these.

868
00:55:52.416 --> 00:55:56.003
What is this? Will it knock me out?
It better knock me out,

869
00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:57.421
'cause if it don't,
I'm gonna knock you out.

870
00:55:57.504 --> 00:55:59.048
Bosco, the buttons are confusing me.

871
00:55:59.256 --> 00:56:01.091
- Shut up, Murdock.
- Come on, Murdock. Let's go.

872
00:56:01.175 --> 00:56:03.427
You gonna fly this plane?
Forget it. I'll turn myself in.

873
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:05.012
- What does this do?
- Come on.

874
00:56:05.345 --> 00:56:07.014
- Come on, Murdock.
- I got lucky.

875
00:56:08.265 --> 00:56:09.266
Hang on, boys.

876
00:56:16.857 --> 00:56:18.525
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

877
00:56:22.029 --> 00:56:23.947
Face, your girlfriend is back.

878
00:56:24.031 --> 00:56:26.533
- Reverse now.
- Son of a bitch!

879
00:56:27.034 --> 00:56:28.327
Move your ass now.

880
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:32.206
- The C-130 versus the Mercedes-Benz.
- Lift us off, Murdock.

881
00:56:33.874 --> 00:56:35.334
How about faster? Faster!

882
00:56:35.417 --> 00:56:36.543
I'm trying. I got it pinned!

883
00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:48.180
Oh, my God!

884
00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.443
Get us to flight control.

885
00:57:03.529 --> 00:57:06.031
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are expecting slight turbulence.

886
00:57:06.115 --> 00:57:08.867
Please remain in your seats
until the captain has turned off

887
00:57:08.951 --> 00:57:11.078
the "Fasten Seatbelt" sign.

888
00:57:11.203 --> 00:57:14.414
Don't worry, boys! Turbulence has never
brought down a plane!

889
00:57:17.709 --> 00:57:19.711
What the hell is that?

890
00:57:19.795 --> 00:57:24.091
But we got inbound subsonic UAVs
with missile lock!

891
00:57:24.424 --> 00:57:26.510
And they bring down planes all the time!

892
00:57:29.429 --> 00:57:32.224
Okay, they're coming in.
Launching countermeasures!

893
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:40.691
Whoa!

894
00:57:42.776 --> 00:57:45.279
Did you see that? That's my diversion!

895
00:57:45.362 --> 00:57:47.406
They die on this version.

896
00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:55.789
Hang on! Hang on! Hold on!
We're going over.

897
00:57:57.124 --> 00:57:59.585
Murdock,
what the hell are you doing?

898
00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:02.796
You boys remember Mexico?

899
00:58:04.423 --> 00:58:05.674
Whoa!

900
00:58:05.757 --> 00:58:07.551
Ladies and gentlemen,
from the flight deck,

901
00:58:07.634 --> 00:58:10.012
if you look out of the right-hand side
of the aircraft, you'll notice

902
00:58:10.095 --> 00:58:12.264
that your right wing is on fire.

903
00:58:15.976 --> 00:58:17.936
Tango reacquired.
Missile lock pending, sir.

904
00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:21.899
Lieutenant Charissa Sosa, DCIS.
Major, do not shoot that aircraft down.

905
00:58:21.982 --> 00:58:23.525
Scramble fighters and force them to land.

906
00:58:23.609 --> 00:58:25.068
There are federal fugitives on that plane.

907
00:58:25.152 --> 00:58:26.486
They've also stolen property
from the U.S. Army.

908
00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:29.239
Billy, Billy, I need you to get the
nose-cam view up here on my monitor now.

909
00:58:29.323 --> 00:58:30.532
It's up, sir. Here it is.

910
00:58:34.786 --> 00:58:36.455
Missile away, sir.

911
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.503
We have shoot-down. Hercules has been
intercepted and destroyed.

912
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:45.923
Sorry, Lieutenant. I'm sorry.

913
00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.937
- I don't believe it.
- We have chute deployment on the Buford.

914
00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.146
What?

915
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:03.523
I want these drones taken off line
right now!

916
00:59:03.607 --> 00:59:05.609
- They're 3,000 miles away.
- Whoever is running those drones.

917
00:59:05.692 --> 00:59:07.277
Get me a direct line
to whoever is running those drones.

918
00:59:07.361 --> 00:59:09.696
We gotta get these drones to stand down
or I'm gonna be on bitch duty.

919
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.490
I need to get those men alive!

920
00:59:17.913 --> 00:59:18.914
Everybody okay?

921
00:59:19.602 --> 00:59:21.104
What are the chances
they think we're dead?

922
00:59:24.816 --> 00:59:25.858
Not great.

923
00:59:25.942 --> 00:59:28.694
- Tell me we ain't still on that plane.
- We ain't on that plane.

924
00:59:28.778 --> 00:59:29.862
- Hannibal!
- Yeah?

925
00:59:29.946 --> 00:59:32.573
If we're under 20,000 feet,
we can still breathe, right?

926
00:59:32.657 --> 00:59:34.200
What are you talking about, 20,000 feet?

927
00:59:34.283 --> 00:59:37.161
- Let's fire up the old weapons system.
- What the hell, man?

928
00:59:37.245 --> 00:59:40.206
Hey, Bosco, a little stuffy.
I'm gonna pop a window!

929
00:59:44.836 --> 00:59:46.129
Yeah!

930
00:59:46.254 --> 00:59:49.549
What you got, bitches? What you got?

931
00:59:51.551 --> 00:59:53.636
Yeah!

932
00:59:54.303 --> 00:59:56.013
Let me have a turn, Face! Come on!

933
00:59:56.097 --> 00:59:58.975
- Why are we in a falling tank?
- Because the plane exploded!

934
00:59:59.058 --> 01:00:00.810
What... What? When?

935
01:00:00.935 --> 01:00:02.186
Recently!

936
01:00:02.311 --> 01:00:04.814
- The Reapers shot it down!
- What Reapers?

937
01:00:08.234 --> 01:00:10.486
The same ones
that are still trying to kill us!

938
01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:12.989
- I blame you, Hannibal!
- Technically, we're not flying.

939
01:00:13.072 --> 01:00:15.449
I know! Because we're falling, fool!

940
01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:23.416
Oh, Jesus!

941
01:00:25.084 --> 01:00:27.628
UAV-2 has splashed down.
We just lost one of the drones.

942
01:00:27.712 --> 01:00:30.131
Hannibal, we're in trouble!

943
01:00:31.465 --> 01:00:32.842
Brace yourselves!

944
01:00:34.135 --> 01:00:35.178
Awesome!

945
01:00:36.846 --> 01:00:38.598
Face, get on to the main gun!

946
01:00:38.681 --> 01:00:40.933
There's a lake a half-mile away
from this position.

947
01:00:41.017 --> 01:00:43.936
- What the hell am I trying to hit?
- Trust me!

948
01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.856
- Rotate the turret 82 degrees.
- Fire in the hole!

949
01:00:48.691 --> 01:00:49.817
- Fire!
- Boom!

950
01:00:52.195 --> 01:00:53.196
Fire!

951
01:00:56.699 --> 01:00:58.951
Are they trying to shoot down
that other drone?

952
01:00:59.035 --> 01:01:01.704
No. They're trying to fly that tank.

953
01:01:01.954 --> 01:01:05.249
- He's flying the tank!
- You can't fly a tank, fool!

954
01:01:05.333 --> 01:01:07.418
- Rotate 16 degrees!
- Got it!

955
01:01:07.501 --> 01:01:08.711
Fire!

956
01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:15.426
Rotate 34 degrees now!

957
01:01:15.509 --> 01:01:17.470
- Hannibal...
- Wait...

958
01:01:17.929 --> 01:01:18.971
Fire!

959
01:01:21.974 --> 01:01:24.393
<i>- Control, we have lost...
- Is that a confirmed hit?</i>

960
01:01:24.644 --> 01:01:26.562
Bring turret full-front and wait!

961
01:01:30.483 --> 01:01:31.859
Murdock! Close the hatch!

962
01:01:31.943 --> 01:01:33.527
Hatch, okay! Did that work?
Did that work?

963
01:01:33.611 --> 01:01:35.112
- Boss!
- Come on, baby.

964
01:01:35.488 --> 01:01:37.698
- Come on.
- Hatch control?

965
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:40.660
I'm too young to die!

966
01:01:40.826 --> 01:01:43.037
Boss! I'm aiming at nothing!

967
01:01:43.996 --> 01:01:45.039
Come on.

968
01:01:45.122 --> 01:01:47.291
- It's been an honor, gentlemen.
- Come on, baby.

969
01:01:47.375 --> 01:01:49.919
The greatest ride is
the last ride, Colonel!

970
01:01:50.253 --> 01:01:52.588
- Fire everything!
- Come on, baby!

971
01:01:59.971 --> 01:02:03.015
- Get right with God, y'all! This is it!
- Come on!

972
01:02:03.099 --> 01:02:04.058
Yee-ha!

973
01:02:11.941 --> 01:02:14.485


974
01:02:15.278 --> 01:02:16.988


975
01:02:20.116 --> 01:02:21.492


976
01:02:21.659 --> 01:02:23.995


977
01:02:43.197 --> 01:02:45.949
All right. Busy bees, busy bees.

978
01:02:47.201 --> 01:02:50.621
Guys, you can take your coats off.
Hot as hell in here.

979
01:02:50.704 --> 01:02:52.289
I'm sweating like a whore in church.

980
01:02:52.373 --> 01:02:53.499
- Sir.
- Yeah?

981
01:02:53.582 --> 01:02:56.794
Smith and his team were engaged
in a C-130 over Mannheim, Germany,

982
01:02:56.877 --> 01:02:58.670
by two Reaper drones.

983
01:02:59.171 --> 01:03:00.964
I'm not sure if it's an encryption glitch,

984
01:03:01.048 --> 01:03:04.093
but it says
that they were shot down in a tank.

985
01:03:05.219 --> 01:03:09.139
NORAD's calling it an X-out,
but there is a conflicting report.

986
01:03:09.765 --> 01:03:11.433
I'm sure there is.

987
01:03:11.558 --> 01:03:14.019
I've got a German Hausfrau
who says she saw a tank

988
01:03:14.103 --> 01:03:17.940
drive up and out of Lake Wolgastsee
with a guy resembling Murdock...

989
01:03:18.023 --> 01:03:20.275
Excuse me, which way to Berlin?

990
01:03:20.359 --> 01:03:23.320
<i>- Asking for directions to Berlin.
- That's impossible.</i>

991
01:03:23.862 --> 01:03:27.658
Well, this will be the second time
Smith has died this week.

992
01:03:27.741 --> 01:03:29.368
Is that possible?

993
01:03:35.249 --> 01:03:37.668
What have you got for me?
Look at this.

994
01:03:37.751 --> 01:03:41.922
We just got the unscrambled composite
of Smith's visitor in prison,

995
01:03:42.214 --> 01:03:44.383
but with no ID on the subject yet.

996
01:03:45.467 --> 01:03:46.760
Hello, handsome.

997
01:03:48.512 --> 01:03:50.597
Wait, I've seen this person before.

998
01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.307
I know this guy.

999
01:03:55.769 --> 01:03:57.020
Baghdad.

1000
01:03:58.063 --> 01:04:01.316
Get me a clean patch to Langley.
We're going fishing.

1001
01:04:01.817 --> 01:04:02.943
I barely even heard about it.

1002
01:04:03.026 --> 01:04:05.612
I mean, I heard bits and pieces of it,
but how much of that was us?

1003
01:04:05.696 --> 01:04:07.030
- So, I have a...
- I was talking.

1004
01:04:07.114 --> 01:04:08.532
- It's never us.
- Can you stop?

1005
01:04:08.615 --> 01:04:10.909
I have a DoD hardline
from Lieutenant Sosa.

1006
01:04:10.993 --> 01:04:12.661
She's looking for Agent Lynch.

1007
01:04:13.036 --> 01:04:15.038
He's not available, ever.

1008
01:04:15.122 --> 01:04:17.124
Agent Lynch, from Baghdad?

1009
01:04:19.668 --> 01:04:21.628
General Morrison's tent?

1010
01:04:23.297 --> 01:04:24.381
Out.

1011
01:04:26.133 --> 01:04:27.426
Why do we have her?

1012
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:31.221
She's got a fantastic personality.
That's why.

1013
01:04:32.097 --> 01:04:33.140
With whom am I speaking?

1014
01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:38.061
This is Lieutenant Sosa.
Is this Agent Lynch?

1015
01:04:38.145 --> 01:04:39.396
I'm sorry, I don't have a first name.

1016
01:04:39.688 --> 01:04:42.983
Neither do I.
So, what can I do you for, Lieutenant?

1017
01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:45.110
I'm looking at an image of you

1018
01:04:45.194 --> 01:04:48.197
from the disciplinary barracks
at Fort Carson.

1019
01:04:49.114 --> 01:04:50.199
She's hot.

1020
01:04:50.282 --> 01:04:53.160
Did you visit
former Colonel Hannibal Smith in prison?

1021
01:04:56.497 --> 01:05:00.667
I don't know what you're talking about,
former Captain.

1022
01:05:00.876 --> 01:05:03.504
<i>Agent Lynch,
if you facilitated Smith's escape</i>

1023
01:05:03.587 --> 01:05:05.714
<i>and are currently aiding
and abetting him...</i>

1024
01:05:07.424 --> 01:05:09.801
Ooh. Buddy.

1025
01:05:09.885 --> 01:05:11.762
<i>If you can make something like that stick,</i>

1026
01:05:12.304 --> 01:05:14.348
your next promotion
should be in the five-star range.

1027
01:05:14.681 --> 01:05:17.476
And if you're helping to retrieve
those engraving plates,

1028
01:05:18.477 --> 01:05:22.314
<i>I'm going to have to go out of my way
to disappoint you.</i>

1029
01:05:32.366 --> 01:05:35.953
I want her phones, her computers,
any support packages she operates.

1030
01:05:36.036 --> 01:05:39.248
I wanna know everything. I want active
intercept taps on everything she's got.

1031
01:05:39.331 --> 01:05:41.166
I want every move monitored
from this moment forward.

1032
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.126
You realize she's DoD.

1033
01:05:44.211 --> 01:05:46.880
I don't care if she's G-O-D. Do it.

1034
01:05:48.757 --> 01:05:50.968
Boss, check this out.

1035
01:05:51.051 --> 01:05:54.179
We've tracked this photograph of Pike
to the KÃ¶nigsbank in Frankfurt.

1036
01:05:54.888 --> 01:05:56.974
<i>Our surveillance
has him and an unknown Arab</i>

1037
01:05:57.057 --> 01:05:59.434
making regular trips
from the train station to the bank

1038
01:05:59.518 --> 01:06:01.478
all over the last month.

1039
01:06:01.687 --> 01:06:03.647
- Pike's getting sloppy.
- Yeah, but if we're onto him,

1040
01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:06.316
what are the odds that Smith and his team
are onto Pike and the Arab, too?

1041
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.736
<i>No, no, no, this is a direct
pull-down from the Pentagon's database.</i>

1042
01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.489
<i>There's absolutely no way Smith
and his team could have this stuff.</i>

1043
01:06:12.573 --> 01:06:16.326
I think we should assume they have
more information than us at all times.

1044
01:06:17.035 --> 01:06:19.121
Pike has been moving
the stolen engraving plates

1045
01:06:19.204 --> 01:06:22.082
to the KÃ¶nigsbank Tower in Frankfurt
over the past month.

1046
01:06:22.457 --> 01:06:24.751
<i>Tomorrow, the last of the cases
containing these plates</i>

1047
01:06:24.835 --> 01:06:27.170
<i>will be transferred to the Arab.</i>

1048
01:06:27.379 --> 01:06:29.506
This will mark the only time
in the last six months

1049
01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:31.383
that all of the plates
have been in one location.

1050
01:06:32.259 --> 01:06:34.720
It's our best and only shot
at getting them back.

1051
01:06:35.012 --> 01:06:38.473
<i>They leave the KÃ¶nigsbank Tower
for the 7:15 train to ZÃ¼rich.</i>

1052
01:06:39.182 --> 01:06:43.604
Gentlemen, we're gonna make sure
they miss that train.

1053
01:06:44.396 --> 01:06:45.856
- Face?
- Yeah.

1054
01:06:46.189 --> 01:06:48.066
Time to bring in your former flame.

1055
01:06:48.442 --> 01:06:49.526
<i>If she's as good as I think,</i>

1056
01:06:50.694 --> 01:06:53.238
<i>then she'll be on her way to Frankfurt
to intercept those plates.</i>

1057
01:06:55.574 --> 01:06:58.243
- Why would you tip her off?
- She's a crusader,

1058
01:06:58.535 --> 01:07:00.287
<i>and we're gonna need her teed up
at some point.</i>

1059
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:01.830
Keep your eyes and ears open, boys.

1060
01:07:01.913 --> 01:07:03.624
Charissa Sosa...

1061
01:07:05.125 --> 01:07:06.585
<i>Charissa Sosa...</i>

1062
01:07:07.044 --> 01:07:08.086
Now the wrinkle.

1063
01:07:09.087 --> 01:07:12.633
<i>If Sosa's onto us,
we can assume that Lynch is onto her.</i>

1064
01:07:14.635 --> 01:07:17.471
<i>And if he thinks she stands
between him and those plates,</i>

1065
01:07:17.929 --> 01:07:19.473
he won't hesitate to kill her.

1066
01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:21.600
Face, get to the train station.

1067
01:07:24.645 --> 01:07:26.104
This is Sosa.

1068
01:07:27.606 --> 01:07:29.816
If there's a threat from
Lynch, deal with it.

1069
01:07:30.442 --> 01:07:31.610
Hello?

1070
01:07:32.194 --> 01:07:34.988
<i>Shoot is green.
Say again, shoot is green.</i>

1071
01:07:36.239 --> 01:07:37.407
Hello?

1072
01:07:44.039 --> 01:07:45.666
Something's wrong.

1073
01:07:48.502 --> 01:07:51.755
We're marked, guys. Pull back.
I don't like this at all.

1074
01:07:51.838 --> 01:07:53.548
See. Don't be seen.

1075
01:07:57.511 --> 01:07:59.262
<i>- Hello, beautiful.
- You have got some balls.</i>

1076
01:07:59.346 --> 01:08:00.889
- You <i>put</i> a drop <i>phone on me?
- I had to, babe.</i>

1077
01:08:00.972 --> 01:08:03.767
<i>It's the only way I could talk to you.
Lynch has all your comm lines.</i>

1078
01:08:04.226 --> 01:08:07.270
<i>- I want you to pull your team now.</i>
- I'm gonna <i>find you,</i> Face.

1079
01:08:07.521 --> 01:08:10.148
But do not engage her
or anyone else directly.

1080
01:08:10.232 --> 01:08:11.608
Not if I find you first.

1081
01:08:19.408 --> 01:08:21.284
Come on, all right... Okay. Okay.

1082
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:26.623
Ow! Ow! Jesus!

1083
01:08:27.582 --> 01:08:29.918
- What the hell are you doing?
- Trying to save you!

1084
01:08:34.172 --> 01:08:35.424
Charissa.

1085
01:08:36.466 --> 01:08:39.970
Come on, you know we're innocent.
You know this.

1086
01:08:40.053 --> 01:08:43.098
You're lying. Like you lied in Baghdad.

1087
01:08:43.181 --> 01:08:46.101
I did not know.
I knew nothing about the plates.

1088
01:08:46.184 --> 01:08:48.353
At that... At that time.

1089
01:08:48.562 --> 01:08:50.897
You are completely full of shit!

1090
01:08:51.064 --> 01:08:52.399
Will you stop selling yourself on that

1091
01:08:52.482 --> 01:08:54.109
and avoiding the fact that you lied to me!

1092
01:08:54.192 --> 01:08:55.277
- You're the one that misled me.
- When?

1093
01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.446
- Come on. You wanna go there?
- Yeah, let's go there.

1094
01:08:57.529 --> 01:08:59.322
You heard I was a player
and you wanted to play.

1095
01:08:59.406 --> 01:09:01.575
And then I got serious and you freaked!

1096
01:09:01.867 --> 01:09:03.827
- Oh, I freaked? I did not freak!
- Yes, you did.

1097
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:07.456
You panicked and you ran.

1098
01:09:14.004 --> 01:09:15.297
Charissa, come on.

1099
01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:18.592
I'm a federal fugitive.
You know exactly how wanted I am.

1100
01:09:18.675 --> 01:09:22.763
You think I came to Frankfurt
to hash out some old heartbreak? No!

1101
01:09:22.929 --> 01:09:26.308
I'm here because we didn't do this.
I'm here because we were set up.

1102
01:09:26.391 --> 01:09:30.020
I'm here because, in the end,
the truth is worth the risk.

1103
01:09:33.106 --> 01:09:36.234
And I believe in you,
even if you don't believe in me.

1104
01:09:40.864 --> 01:09:43.408
God, I forgot how beautiful you are.

1105
01:09:49.206 --> 01:09:50.791
Hold on to that phone.

1106
01:10:03.303 --> 01:10:04.304


1107
01:10:04.387 --> 01:10:05.514


1108
01:10:05.639 --> 01:10:07.015


1109
01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.809


1110
01:10:08.892 --> 01:10:10.268
Sucker.

1111
01:10:12.646 --> 01:10:14.064
- Oh, shit.
- Where's Peck?

1112
01:10:15.482 --> 01:10:17.150
Excellent question. Find him!

1113
01:10:17.609 --> 01:10:20.487
<i>Please stay calm
and go to the nearest exit.</i>

1114
01:10:50.684 --> 01:10:52.018
<i>Meet you up on corridor three.</i>

1115
01:10:55.689 --> 01:10:58.358
<i>Three to base. We're
all clear at this time.</i>

1116
01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:03.238
<i>Give me confirmation
as soon as the package is secure.</i>

1117
01:11:06.408 --> 01:11:08.034
<i>We need a video feed.</i>

1118
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:30.221
Okay, let's dance.

1119
01:11:30.472 --> 01:11:32.807
Coming down. Positions, prepare to move.

1120
01:11:33.933 --> 01:11:35.393
As always, stay close to me, sir.

1121
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:52.076
<i>Closing off the 10th floor.</i>

1122
01:11:55.246 --> 01:11:56.706
<i>Tenth floor, we need backup.</i>

1123
01:11:57.582 --> 01:11:58.583
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

1124
01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.168
<i>I can't see anything.</i>

1125
01:12:00.418 --> 01:12:01.586
How we doing there, big man?

1126
01:12:01.878 --> 01:12:03.338
<i>Murdock, here comes the Arab.</i>

1127
01:12:03.421 --> 01:12:05.089
And <i>here's</i> a long <i>drive</i>

1128
01:12:05.173 --> 01:12:07.091
<i>hit deep into left center field.</i>

1129
01:12:07.175 --> 01:12:11.137
<i>Murdock's back, he's at the wall,
and he makes the catch!</i>

1130
01:12:12.305 --> 01:12:13.431
I can't breathe.

1131
01:12:14.265 --> 01:12:15.600
It's a trap!

1132
01:12:18.394 --> 01:12:19.729
Pete, we need backup!

1133
01:12:35.078 --> 01:12:36.955
<i>B.A., I lost the case.</i>

1134
01:12:37.789 --> 01:12:39.415
<i>I'm taking fire. I'm out of here.</i>

1135
01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.093
B.A., get to those plates.

1136
01:13:45.518 --> 01:13:47.520
Deutsche Federal is responding
to explosions and shots fired

1137
01:13:47.604 --> 01:13:49.773
- at the KÃ©nigsbank building.
- Get us out of this mess and get us

1138
01:13:49.856 --> 01:13:52.317
- to that building as soon as possible.
- Yes, ma'am.

1139
01:14:10.794 --> 01:14:13.379
You made me work for this one, Baracus.

1140
01:14:13.463 --> 01:14:16.174
I didn't think I was this out of shape.

1141
01:14:16.508 --> 01:14:18.426
I am, unfortunately.

1142
01:14:18.635 --> 01:14:20.512
Where's the rest of the team, huh?

1143
01:14:20.595 --> 01:14:24.724
Smith. Peck. That idiot pilot, the asshole.
What's his name?

1144
01:14:31.637 --> 01:14:34.432
I'm gonna take this one out of your ass,
Baracus. Let's see what you got.

1145
01:14:38.853 --> 01:14:40.813
Come on. What are you doing?
What, are you tired?

1146
01:14:40.897 --> 01:14:42.065
I'm not gonna hurt you, man.

1147
01:14:42.148 --> 01:14:44.150
No, you're not gonna hurt me,
I'm gonna hurt you.

1148
01:14:50.031 --> 01:14:51.824
- I don't wanna kill you, man.
- You don't wanna kill me?

1149
01:14:51.908 --> 01:14:53.826
You're not gonna kill me.
I'm gonna kill you, Baraous.

1150
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:55.036
I'm not playing with you, Pike.

1151
01:14:55.119 --> 01:14:58.164
Here we go, because I got two guns.
I'm a lefty, remember that, right?

1152
01:14:58.247 --> 01:15:00.625
So, as soon as
that hammer goes back, it's on.

1153
01:15:00.708 --> 01:15:02.418
I swear to God, I'll do it.

1154
01:15:02.502 --> 01:15:04.504
You're not a coward, are you?

1155
01:15:05.421 --> 01:15:07.215
Are you?

1156
01:15:11.386 --> 01:15:12.387
<i>Whoopsy.</i>

1157
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:13.554
Damn!

1158
01:15:13.638 --> 01:15:15.223
- Need a ride, big fella?
- You're a life-saver, man.

1159
01:15:15.306 --> 01:15:16.391
I couldn't shoot him.

1160
01:15:24.768 --> 01:15:27.604
Get out of the way! Get down! Get down!

1161
01:15:52.253 --> 01:15:55.173
U.S. Military!
Put them down. Put them down.

1162
01:15:58.009 --> 01:15:59.260
This is U.S. Military. We got him.

1163
01:15:59.344 --> 01:16:02.263
Yeah, this is about
the right amount of cops.

1164
01:16:02.347 --> 01:16:05.475
That's cute.
You're lucky there are people around.

1165
01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:08.353
No, sweetheart, you're lucky.

1166
01:16:15.191 --> 01:16:17.777
All right. Not a
peep out of the Arab.

1167
01:16:18.402 --> 01:16:19.695
Sosa was at the train station.

1168
01:16:20.237 --> 01:16:22.031
- You saw her?
- Yeah.

1169
01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.075
Did you talk to her?

1170
01:16:24.158 --> 01:16:26.869
I had no choice, okay?
Just trust me on that.

1171
01:16:26.952 --> 01:16:29.830
I trust you
to make historically bad decisions

1172
01:16:29.914 --> 01:16:31.332
where women are concerned.

1173
01:16:31.415 --> 01:16:33.709
What part of you
is thinking at the moment?

1174
01:16:33.793 --> 01:16:36.045
Lynch's men moved in on her
and I had to react.

1175
01:16:36.128 --> 01:16:39.173
Please. Somehow I doubt that.

1176
01:16:39.256 --> 01:16:42.176
Hey. What are you so pissed about?
We got the plates.

1177
01:16:42.259 --> 01:16:44.553
You wanted her teed up. She's teed up.

1178
01:16:44.637 --> 01:16:46.931
She knows we didn't steal them.

1179
01:16:47.598 --> 01:16:50.267
She'll be thrilled to find out who did.

1180
01:16:52.103 --> 01:16:53.187
What?

1181
01:16:53.604 --> 01:16:55.231
You had to know.

1182
01:16:57.691 --> 01:16:59.276
You had to know.

1183
01:17:00.736 --> 01:17:05.241
You had to know if you left me alive,
that this was coming.

1184
01:17:11.038 --> 01:17:12.706
How could you not?

1185
01:17:17.253 --> 01:17:20.464
Hannibal. You know who this is?

1186
01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.766
We all do.

1187
01:17:34.937 --> 01:17:36.188
Morrison?

1188
01:17:36.522 --> 01:17:38.149
Hell, no.

1189
01:17:39.316 --> 01:17:40.818
Jesus Christ.

1190
01:17:41.485 --> 01:17:45.823
Not so sure that it is a blessing,
but good hunting, my friend.

1191
01:17:48.617 --> 01:17:49.660
Thank you.

1192
01:17:50.661 --> 01:17:52.371
You son of a bitch.

1193
01:17:58.586 --> 01:18:01.172
Morrison? Holy shit.

1194
01:18:01.672 --> 01:18:02.882
Outside.

1195
01:18:04.675 --> 01:18:06.844
All of you, outside now.

1196
01:18:08.345 --> 01:18:12.349
I knew if Lynch helped me escape,
you had to be part of it.

1197
01:18:15.144 --> 01:18:18.230
You and Pike were making a play
on those plates with Lynch,

1198
01:18:18.314 --> 01:18:20.191
and you turned on him.

1199
01:18:20.274 --> 01:18:21.942
The way you turned on us.

1200
01:18:22.026 --> 01:18:24.361
Lynch was never gonna cut us in.

1201
01:18:27.031 --> 01:18:28.782
He was gonna use us.

1202
01:18:29.408 --> 01:18:31.702
He brought you on as insurance.

1203
01:18:31.952 --> 01:18:35.498
He never thought you'd betray
your oldest living friend.

1204
01:18:36.165 --> 01:18:39.210
I just hit first, Hannibal.
I'm a fighting man.

1205
01:18:39.335 --> 01:18:41.504
You're a liar and a traitor!

1206
01:18:43.214 --> 01:18:45.299
<i>You knew Morrison
was masquerading as the Arab.</i>

1207
01:18:45.382 --> 01:18:47.468
<i>- Why not share that?
- I wasn't 100% sure.</i>

1208
01:18:47.551 --> 01:18:49.053
How about 99%?

1209
01:18:49.553 --> 01:18:51.889
Would you think
it was worth mentioning then?

1210
01:18:52.556 --> 01:18:54.016
Lynch, what did you think?

1211
01:18:54.683 --> 01:18:56.227
<i>You think I'd just kill him On the spot?</i>

1212
01:18:56.352 --> 01:18:58.729
I was certain of it. I still am.

1213
01:18:58.854 --> 01:19:00.731
<i>Do you have the plates?</i>

1214
01:19:00.814 --> 01:19:02.525
I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't.

1215
01:19:03.067 --> 01:19:07.947
Smith, return the plates, kill Morrison,
and reclaim your lives.

1216
01:19:08.197 --> 01:19:11.200
I want signed and authorized
amnesty agreements

1217
01:19:11.283 --> 01:19:13.744
for myself and for each of my men.

1218
01:19:13.869 --> 01:19:15.788
From the White House,
the State Department

1219
01:19:15.871 --> 01:19:17.915
<i>and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</i>

1220
01:19:18.082 --> 01:19:19.458
You hear me?

1221
01:19:22.086 --> 01:19:23.420
I'm gonna need a little more time.

1222
01:19:24.922 --> 01:19:25.965
How much?

1223
01:19:32.513 --> 01:19:33.556
Give me five minutes.

1224
01:19:34.265 --> 01:19:35.558
I'm waiting.

1225
01:19:39.770 --> 01:19:41.355
<i>Do you have the plates?</i>

1226
01:19:41.438 --> 01:19:43.190
<i>I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't.</i>

1227
01:19:43.983 --> 01:19:49.154
<i>Smith, return the plates,
kill Morrison, and reclaim your lives.</i>

1228
01:19:53.826 --> 01:19:56.036
I saw your tomb at Arlington.

1229
01:19:57.246 --> 01:20:00.207
<i>You died a national hero.</i>

1230
01:20:13.137 --> 01:20:14.430
Death's too easy.

1231
01:20:15.014 --> 01:20:17.600
And the last thing we need now
is another lie.

1232
01:20:17.683 --> 01:20:20.728
Don't do this. Hannibal, please.
You owe me that much.

1233
01:20:20.811 --> 01:20:22.438
You owe me!

1234
01:20:23.272 --> 01:20:24.982
You're gonna tell them we're innocent.

1235
01:20:27.151 --> 01:20:28.527
You owe me.

1236
01:20:30.362 --> 01:20:32.489
Hannibal, it's meaningless.

1237
01:20:32.615 --> 01:20:35.618
What are you fighting for now,
you and those boys?

1238
01:20:35.701 --> 01:20:38.537
Your ranks? Your reputations?

1239
01:20:38.621 --> 01:20:39.663
They're shit!

1240
01:20:40.456 --> 01:20:42.041
You're convicts!

1241
01:20:42.207 --> 01:20:45.544
Plates, no plates, you
are federal fugitives,

1242
01:20:45.628 --> 01:20:49.423
and when they're done with you, Hannibal,
they just burn you.

1243
01:20:50.341 --> 01:20:54.428
Zulu one, Zulu one, this is Broadsword,
you're clear to engage.

1244
01:20:54.511 --> 01:20:56.889
"Broadsword."
Did you come up with that?

1245
01:20:56.972 --> 01:20:59.350
That's awesome. "Broadsword."

1246
01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.018
"Broadsword."

1247
01:21:03.604 --> 01:21:05.189
Boss, could you do that?

1248
01:21:08.275 --> 01:21:09.443
To us?

1249
01:21:10.152 --> 01:21:11.612
What Morrison did?

1250
01:21:11.695 --> 01:21:15.616
No. I'd rather face a firing squad
than betray you boys.

1251
01:21:17.076 --> 01:21:19.078
Yeah, but you didn't see it coming, though.

1252
01:21:19.286 --> 01:21:21.246
No. I...

1253
01:21:23.874 --> 01:21:25.959
I didn't see it coming.

1254
01:21:30.631 --> 01:21:31.882
Move!

1255
01:21:43.933 --> 01:21:46.728
Wow. That's awesome.

1256
01:21:47.103 --> 01:21:49.522
That looks exactly like Call of <i>Duty,</i>
doesn't it?

1257
01:21:49.731 --> 01:21:51.774
All right. Here's the deal.
No press release.

1258
01:21:51.858 --> 01:21:54.152
Keep local law enforcement
and media off-site.

1259
01:21:54.235 --> 01:21:56.738
Get a three-mile cordon,
ditto the no-fly zone.

1260
01:21:56.821 --> 01:22:01.284
Get an agency scrub team out there
and get me the goddamn plates back.

1261
01:22:02.744 --> 01:22:07.331
The German police have your entire team
in custody in the KÃ¶nigsbank Tower.

1262
01:22:09.167 --> 01:22:13.046
I don't do teams, babe. That's Smith's bag.
I'm strictly a solo act.

1263
01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:24.223
I like to travel light.

1264
01:22:24.307 --> 01:22:28.770
Stuff like loyalty doesn't fit
in the overhead bins.

1265
01:22:30.063 --> 01:22:33.066
I thought you and Smith
were working together.

1266
01:22:33.608 --> 01:22:35.276
You thought wrong.

1267
01:22:35.485 --> 01:22:38.738
Yes, we have weapons.
No, you may not wand us.

1268
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:42.909
<i>If you want to deal, we can deal.</i>

1269
01:22:43.743 --> 01:22:47.955
How about I dedicate my immediate future

1270
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:50.583
to destroying yours?

1271
01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:54.837
How about you get smart and start dealing

1272
01:22:55.630 --> 01:22:57.381
before somebody else does?

1273
01:22:59.801 --> 01:23:00.802
Former Captain.

1274
01:23:00.885 --> 01:23:03.054
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1275
01:23:03.137 --> 01:23:05.890
Unless you've got a piece of paper
that looks exactly like this one,

1276
01:23:05.973 --> 01:23:09.060
then this troubled young loner
belongs to me.

1277
01:23:09.143 --> 01:23:10.436
Let's go.

1278
01:23:11.104 --> 01:23:12.980
How the hell
did they get an extradition order?

1279
01:23:13.064 --> 01:23:15.858
Sorry, Pike.
At least with me, there are rules.

1280
01:23:15.942 --> 01:23:18.861
CIA's got rules.
Our rules are just cooler than yours.

1281
01:23:20.029 --> 01:23:21.322
- Go.
- You know, Lynch,

1282
01:23:21.405 --> 01:23:24.992
if I could seal this room with you inside,
I'd be doing the world a big favor.

1283
01:23:25.076 --> 01:23:27.245
That's not nice.

1284
01:23:28.329 --> 01:23:29.372
Lynch? Had to be.

1285
01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:32.917
Stay close to the fires, boys.

1286
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.712
If that gunship is still around,
it won't read our body heat.

1287
01:23:36.796 --> 01:23:41.008
That idiot Lynch, so quick to kill
us, didn't even bother locating the plates.

1288
01:23:41.509 --> 01:23:44.095
Where do we stand
on the non-violence now, B.A.?

1289
01:23:44.178 --> 01:23:46.180
You pissed? You should be.

1290
01:23:46.347 --> 01:23:49.684
Who gives a shit about the plates?
Morrison was the only way to clear us.

1291
01:23:49.767 --> 01:23:52.353
And without Morrison, we got nothing.

1292
01:23:53.688 --> 01:23:56.190
- What do we do, boss?
- I don't know, Murdock.

1293
01:23:56.774 --> 01:23:58.526
- I don't know.
- I do.

1294
01:24:00.528 --> 01:24:04.073
This guy Lynch,
I think I got him figured out.

1295
01:24:04.448 --> 01:24:06.701
- You got a plan, kid?
- How do we get out of here?

1296
01:24:08.369 --> 01:24:09.495
Give me 20 minutes.

1297
01:24:14.667 --> 01:24:17.837
So, Morrison's dead.
Smith and his team are dead.

1298
01:24:18.045 --> 01:24:20.965
Another 15 minutes or so,
we locate those engraving plates.

1299
01:24:21.048 --> 01:24:22.592
What is this? Are you gloating?

1300
01:24:22.675 --> 01:24:26.053
No, this is me beating you
after you burned me.

1301
01:24:26.387 --> 01:24:28.472
- We had a deal, remember?
- Not you and me.

1302
01:24:28.556 --> 01:24:30.308
- You, me and Morrison.
- Not you and me, directly.

1303
01:24:30.391 --> 01:24:32.977
And you two collude and cut me out.

1304
01:24:35.521 --> 01:24:36.856
Hey. What are you doing? In the car?

1305
01:24:36.939 --> 01:24:38.441
Are we doing...
Are we gonna do this in the car?

1306
01:24:38.524 --> 01:24:40.610
- You doing this?
- He's gonna do it.

1307
01:24:40.693 --> 01:24:43.196
Way to go.
That's brilliant, right there.

1308
01:24:43.279 --> 01:24:44.947
What are you doing? What is he doing?

1309
01:24:45.031 --> 01:24:46.741
- Jesus.
- How's it going, Kyle?

1310
01:24:46.824 --> 01:24:48.910
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1311
01:24:49.035 --> 01:24:51.787
Brother, you are far from good.
What are you doing?

1312
01:24:51.871 --> 01:24:53.831
It's a European silencer.

1313
01:24:53.915 --> 01:24:57.251
It's a suppressor. Counter-clockwise.
You're holding a gun like that?

1314
01:24:57.335 --> 01:24:59.170
You've held a gun like that before
and you're still here?

1315
01:24:59.253 --> 01:25:00.755
That's amazing.

1316
01:25:00.838 --> 01:25:02.506
- Don't point that thing...
- Jesus. Final request,

1317
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:04.175
don't let this guy shoot me, please.

1318
01:25:10.973 --> 01:25:12.683
So, if Sosa knows we're alive...

1319
01:25:12.767 --> 01:25:15.228
She'll believe
Morrison is alive, too.

1320
01:25:15.478 --> 01:25:18.272
Let's just hope that Lynch
still has Sosa's comm lines.

1321
01:25:21.776 --> 01:25:23.236
This is Sosa.

1322
01:25:23.402 --> 01:25:25.947
<i>General Morrison
is in my possession.</i>

1323
01:25:26.656 --> 01:25:29.617
What? I'm sorry.
I can't hear you. Who is this?

1324
01:25:30.493 --> 01:25:32.912
- Okay, this was not well thought out.
- No shit.

1325
01:25:32.995 --> 01:25:34.872
I mean, look at this.
Am I to teach you how to kill me?

1326
01:25:34.956 --> 01:25:36.666
Hey, do me a favor, all right?
Put the barrel...

1327
01:25:36.749 --> 01:25:38.209
Put the gun flush to my head.

1328
01:25:38.292 --> 01:25:40.044
- Are you sure?
- There you go, right there.

1329
01:25:40.127 --> 01:25:43.547
- Is that going to go through?
- Before you hurt somebody besides me.

1330
01:25:43.631 --> 01:25:44.924
There you go. We're okay. We're okay.

1331
01:25:46.133 --> 01:25:48.844
Never cuff a man in a seated position
with his hands behind his back.

1332
01:25:48.928 --> 01:25:50.763
Makes it impossible to see the hands.

1333
01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:52.348
That was cool.

1334
01:25:52.515 --> 01:25:54.392
- You like that?
- I like that.

1335
01:25:54.725 --> 01:25:56.060
I like that a lot.

1336
01:25:56.143 --> 01:25:57.853
Are you all right, you idiot?

1337
01:25:57.937 --> 01:26:00.815
- Yeah. It was a good hit.
- Please handcuff him.

1338
01:26:00.898 --> 01:26:02.817
We don't need to use them again.
We don't need the cuffs.

1339
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.068
Who are you talking to?

1340
01:26:04.151 --> 01:26:05.152
- Brad, phone or gun.
- Jesus.

1341
01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:07.898
- Phone or gun. Pick.
- Hey, hey.

1342
01:26:07.982 --> 01:26:11.527
- Put the gun down.
- Hey, I didn't burn you. Morrison did.

1343
01:26:11.652 --> 01:26:12.903
I really wanna shoot you.

1344
01:26:12.987 --> 01:26:14.989
You gotta hear this, sir.

1345
01:26:15.156 --> 01:26:16.699
<i>IS this Smith?</i>

1346
01:26:17.074 --> 01:26:19.577
<i>From</i> a <i>former colonel
to</i> a <i>former captain,</i>

1347
01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:22.705
<i>I know I've got about 30 seconds
before you lock this signal.</i>

1348
01:26:22.788 --> 01:26:25.916
<i>- So listen, we can prove our innocence.
- Leave that on the floor like</i> that?

1349
01:26:26.292 --> 01:26:28.419
Okay. All right. Now, go back.

1350
01:26:28.502 --> 01:26:31.088
Did you say you have Morrison?
You have General Morrison?

1351
01:26:31.547 --> 01:26:33.299
<i>- Correct.
- You have him alive?</i>

1352
01:26:33.382 --> 01:26:37.136
<i>And well, despite Lynch
trying to wipe us out wholesale.</i>

1353
01:26:38.012 --> 01:26:41.515
Too much to explain now
but Morrison's testimony frees us

1354
01:26:41.849 --> 01:26:43.434
<i>and fries Lynch.</i>

1355
01:26:45.686 --> 01:26:46.687
Uh-oh.

1356
01:26:47.063 --> 01:26:48.564
Well, not without the plates.

1357
01:26:49.023 --> 01:26:50.483
<i>Also in my possession.</i>

1358
01:26:50.733 --> 01:26:54.612
Remember, Lynch thinks we're dead,
and I want to keep it that way.

1359
01:26:54.695 --> 01:26:56.155
- <i>All right. We'll deal.</i>
- Give <i>me</i> a <i>pen.</i>

1360
01:26:56.238 --> 01:26:57.698
- Where and <i>when?</i>
- Got a pen? Anybody got a pen?

1361
01:26:57.782 --> 01:27:00.076
<i>- LA docks, 48 hours, dawn.
- You</i> still <i>use</i> a <i>pen?</i>

1362
01:27:01.661 --> 01:27:04.121
<i>I deliver Morrison and the plates.</i>

1363
01:27:04.246 --> 01:27:08.167
In return, I want a retrial
in front of a civilian court.

1364
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:10.836
All right. We'll deal.

1365
01:27:11.545 --> 01:27:13.673
LA docks, 48 hours from now.

1366
01:27:13.881 --> 01:27:17.468
Any bullshit from your end,
and that's it, deal's off.

1367
01:27:20.262 --> 01:27:22.640
- Did we get him?
- No.

1368
01:27:25.518 --> 01:27:26.602
Pike.

1369
01:27:27.311 --> 01:27:29.522
You believe in second chances?

1370
01:27:29.605 --> 01:27:30.731
Uh...

1371
01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.566
I do now.

1372
01:27:33.275 --> 01:27:34.652
Too much?

1373
01:27:35.111 --> 01:27:37.029
I thought you were spot-on.

1374
01:27:39.365 --> 01:27:40.574
My turn.

1375
01:27:51.210 --> 01:27:53.087
Hold on to that phone.

1376
01:28:01.512 --> 01:28:02.972
This is Sosa.

1377
01:28:03.055 --> 01:28:04.432
<i>Hello, beautiful.</i>

1378
01:28:05.057 --> 01:28:06.434
Thank you.

1379
01:28:14.734 --> 01:28:17.611
They got the raw end of the deal,
didn't they? Look at B.A.

1380
01:28:17.695 --> 01:28:19.822
He looks like a huge banana.

1381
01:28:21.198 --> 01:28:22.241
Good morning, my friend.

1382
01:28:22.324 --> 01:28:23.325
Good morning.

1383
01:28:28.456 --> 01:28:30.374
Rabbi Binky Rabinowitz?

1384
01:28:33.794 --> 01:28:35.004
What passport did I give you?

1385
01:28:35.087 --> 01:28:37.548
You're from Tanzania.
My mother is from Tanzania.

1386
01:28:37.631 --> 01:28:39.133
- Oh, shit.
- What the hell happened?

1387
01:28:48.809 --> 01:28:51.520
- Converting Africans to Judaism.
- This is station six...

1388
01:28:51.604 --> 01:28:52.646
Stuff like that.

1389
01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:55.191
Let's get ready to move.
There's three to my right.

1390
01:28:55.274 --> 01:28:56.984
There's two behind me
and one at the northeast exit.

1391
01:29:01.864 --> 01:29:02.907
Wait a sec.

1392
01:29:06.869 --> 01:29:08.162
<i>Shalom.</i>

1393
01:29:11.624 --> 01:29:15.002
- What's he doing?
- It's Murdock. Telling his life story.

1394
01:29:18.506 --> 01:29:19.590
There is a God.

1395
01:29:19.673 --> 01:29:22.092
- You speak Swahili?
- You don't?

1396
01:29:22.676 --> 01:29:24.345
You got enough
to work with, kid?

1397
01:29:24.428 --> 01:29:25.429
We Will.

1398
01:29:25.513 --> 01:29:29.141
You and I have some major favors
moving across the mid-Atlantic right now.

1399
01:29:29.225 --> 01:29:32.269
It's a deep-sea freighter,
shipping strictly black-market merch.

1400
01:29:32.353 --> 01:29:33.938
How do we get out to her?

1401
01:29:34.021 --> 01:29:35.523
A boat. A plain old boat.

1402
01:29:35.606 --> 01:29:38.359
This is what I'm talking about, Murdock.
Traveling the open seas in style.

1403
01:29:38.442 --> 01:29:41.904
This is the way I like to travel.
Classy-like. The way people used to, safe.

1404
01:29:41.987 --> 01:29:43.072
- Yeah...
- We don't need a plane.

1405
01:29:43.155 --> 01:29:46.367
You know, Bosco, hopefully one day
we'll get you over your fear of flying.

1406
01:29:46.450 --> 01:29:47.535
What?

1407
01:29:49.078 --> 01:29:50.287
Hey, that ain't a boat!

1408
01:29:52.373 --> 01:29:53.874
Just not today.

1409
01:29:54.959 --> 01:29:56.710
Murdock, don't you remember what I said?

1410
01:29:56.794 --> 01:29:58.462
- I said you have to catch him...
- You have to catch him...

1411
01:29:58.546 --> 01:30:00.631
- after you inject him.
- After you inject him.

1412
01:30:02.925 --> 01:30:03.968
My bad.

1413
01:30:30.744 --> 01:30:33.539
Damn it! My head, man.

1414
01:30:37.585 --> 01:30:41.630
- Coconut-curry tapenade, your favorite.
- Give me that, fool.

1415
01:30:42.047 --> 01:30:44.091
You get them toast points?

1416
01:30:44.508 --> 01:30:46.677
<i>VoilÃ . Toast poms.</i>

1417
01:30:49.096 --> 01:30:51.390
Y'all knocked me out again, huh?

1418
01:30:51.473 --> 01:30:55.352
Okay, now, the whole injection,
knocking out,

1419
01:30:56.103 --> 01:30:57.855
Hannibal and Face.

1420
01:30:58.188 --> 01:31:00.983
The curry tapenade, Murdock.

1421
01:31:01.275 --> 01:31:04.069
Why do I feel like I fell on my face?

1422
01:31:04.570 --> 01:31:06.280
Huh? Tell me that.

1423
01:31:08.365 --> 01:31:09.366
Uh...

1424
01:31:10.492 --> 01:31:11.827
Lynch is a paradox.

1425
01:31:11.911 --> 01:31:13.787
Murdock, you done with that?

1426
01:31:13.871 --> 01:31:18.375
This is a guy who needs anonymity,
but he loves theatricality.

1427
01:31:19.919 --> 01:31:22.379
He's an administrator,
he's not an operator.

1428
01:31:25.758 --> 01:31:27.134
Where is it?

1429
01:31:28.969 --> 01:31:30.179
Very nice.

1430
01:31:30.930 --> 01:31:33.933
So he stays as far away
from the point of impact as possible,

1431
01:31:34.016 --> 01:31:36.352
<i>and never gets his hands dirty
if he can help it.</i>

1432
01:31:36.435 --> 01:31:37.978
<i>But we're gonna change all that.</i>

1433
01:31:38.062 --> 01:31:39.730
You can't hustle a hustler, fool.

1434
01:31:42.524 --> 01:31:46.236
No sparks, no flames,
not even a flashlight near this stuff.

1435
01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.821
Easy, easy.

1436
01:31:48.989 --> 01:31:52.076
<i>This guy is never
at the flashpoint of anything.</i>

1437
01:31:54.828 --> 01:31:57.373
<i>He's safe and sound somewhere,
pulling the strings.</i>

1438
01:31:59.083 --> 01:32:00.542
Mama. Mama.

1439
01:32:00.834 --> 01:32:02.920
Hey, boss. Why so many
of these damn things anyway?

1440
01:32:03.003 --> 01:32:06.048
Because overkill is underrated, my friend.

1441
01:32:08.175 --> 01:32:11.428
<i>So we're gonna bring this guy
down to ground level.</i>

1442
01:32:11.512 --> 01:32:12.888
Mama. Mama.

1443
01:32:12.972 --> 01:32:15.265
<i>This way, Lynch. Lynch.</i>

1444
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:18.894
<i>The last place he'd ever want to be.</i>

1445
01:32:21.355 --> 01:32:25.192
Then you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

1446
01:32:26.193 --> 01:32:27.695
Any questions?

1447
01:32:30.531 --> 01:32:32.408
What's up, boss man?

1448
01:32:32.574 --> 01:32:33.867
Hey, B.A.

1449
01:32:33.951 --> 01:32:36.245
It's gonna get heavy, isn't it?

1450
01:32:38.038 --> 01:32:40.541
Well, I can't promise you it won't.

1451
01:32:41.375 --> 01:32:43.752
Let me read you something real quick.

1452
01:32:43.836 --> 01:32:47.881
"Victory attained by violence
is tantamount to defeat,"

1453
01:32:49.133 --> 01:32:50.843
<i>"for it is momentary."</i>

1454
01:32:52.538 --> 01:32:53.747
Gandhi.

1455
01:32:54.623 --> 01:32:58.585
"It is better to be violent
if there is violence in our hearts,"

1456
01:32:58.752 --> 01:33:01.964
"than to put on the cloak of non-violence
to cover impotence."

1457
01:33:04.591 --> 01:33:06.093
Who said that?

1458
01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:07.719
Same guy.

1459
01:33:08.846 --> 01:33:12.266
Gandhi wasn't afraid to fight
for the things he believed in.

1460
01:33:13.433 --> 01:33:15.519
What is it you believe in, B.A.?

1461
01:33:38.834 --> 01:33:40.335
What's wrong?

1462
01:33:40.627 --> 01:33:43.338
I don't know, man.
I'm just thinking past this.

1463
01:33:43.422 --> 01:33:47.593
You know, we've always come back alive,

1464
01:33:47.676 --> 01:33:51.388
the four of us, 'cause of the old man.

1465
01:33:51.471 --> 01:33:52.806
- I know.
- I'm not him.

1466
01:33:52.890 --> 01:33:54.474
Face, I know this.

1467
01:33:54.558 --> 01:33:56.685
Murdock, I'm not Hannibal.

1468
01:33:58.645 --> 01:34:01.356
Who has the most to lose on this, Face?

1469
01:34:01.732 --> 01:34:02.858
Me.

1470
01:34:04.651 --> 01:34:05.819
And I trust you.

1471
01:34:07.905 --> 01:34:10.115
Yeah, I know,

1472
01:34:11.241 --> 01:34:12.492
but you're crazy.

1473
01:34:17.372 --> 01:34:18.832
Not that crazy.

1474
01:34:36.925 --> 01:34:38.510
<i>Our eagles may have landed.</i>

1475
01:34:38.593 --> 01:34:39.719
<i>Everybody ready to roll?</i>

1476
01:34:39.803 --> 01:34:41.096
<i>Copy. Team one on the move.</i>

1477
01:34:41.179 --> 01:34:42.889
<i>Acknowledged. Team two en route.</i>

1478
01:34:49.855 --> 01:34:52.649
All right, guys, everybody ready?

1479
01:34:53.483 --> 01:34:55.193
Curtain's about to come up.

1480
01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.655
Show time.

1481
01:35:04.536 --> 01:35:06.121
That's Smith right there. Watch him.

1482
01:35:07.956 --> 01:35:10.000
<i>Ground team is in position?</i>

1483
01:35:10.083 --> 01:35:11.501
Standing by.

1484
01:35:13.003 --> 01:35:14.129
In position.

1485
01:35:16.673 --> 01:35:18.383
Shoot Team One. Affirmative.

1486
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:20.218
Spotter One. 10-8.

1487
01:35:20.886 --> 01:35:22.596
Let's chattermark on comms for now.

1488
01:35:22.679 --> 01:35:25.390
Morrison's the primary tango.
Plates are the package.

1489
01:35:27.392 --> 01:35:28.476
Yeah.

1490
01:35:29.227 --> 01:35:32.022
<i>Okay, okay, he's talking to Sosa.
I want this call.</i>

1491
01:35:32.188 --> 01:35:34.024
You lied to me, Sosa. We had a deal.

1492
01:35:34.107 --> 01:35:36.192
I want that goddamn call in my...
Thank you.

1493
01:35:36.276 --> 01:35:38.445
<i>We had a deal,
but I'm changing the deal.</i>

1494
01:35:38.653 --> 01:35:40.530
<i>Are you kidding me, Sosa?
Are you kidding me?</i>

1495
01:35:40.614 --> 01:35:43.617
<i>This is</i> a <i>complicated exchange
and you have no play here.</i>

1496
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:45.827
<i>Listen, or remain at-large fugitives</i>

1497
01:35:45.911 --> 01:35:47.996
<i>- for the foreseeable future.
- Uh-oh. No! No, no.</i>

1498
01:35:48.079 --> 01:35:50.415
For God sakes,
I've got Morrison here and the plates.

1499
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:52.918
<i>I'm exposed, Sosa. Exposed!</i>

1500
01:35:53.001 --> 01:35:54.669
<i>We're not doing this on the docks.</i>

1501
01:35:54.753 --> 01:35:56.379
Now listen to me,
we're not turning ourselves in.

1502
01:35:56.463 --> 01:35:59.007
Now you listen to me,
we're not turning ourselves in.

1503
01:35:59.090 --> 01:36:01.426
<i>I need you to do it on my terms
or nothing at all.</i>

1504
01:36:01.509 --> 01:36:03.345
<i>To hell with that,
and to hell with you, Sosa!</i>

1505
01:36:03.428 --> 01:36:04.554
Ah. She burned him.

1506
01:36:04.638 --> 01:36:08.183
<i>Face, B.A., we're bugging out.
Sosa's jammed us.</i>

1507
01:36:08.433 --> 01:36:11.227
Murdock, get the chopper down here in 10.

1508
01:36:13.647 --> 01:36:14.689
Okay, he's moving him.

1509
01:36:14.773 --> 01:36:16.024
<i>You got him? He's moving him.</i>

1510
01:36:16.601 --> 01:36:17.811
For the love of God, relax.

1511
01:36:18.103 --> 01:36:20.105
<i>I am relaxed. He's moving him.</i>

1512
01:36:20.188 --> 01:36:22.065
<i>Don't do this.</i> Hannibal, please.

1513
01:36:22.148 --> 01:36:25.193
- That's Morrison, right there. Take him.
- Wait, does he have the plates?

1514
01:36:25.277 --> 01:36:26.695
Smith has the plates. Go now.

1515
01:36:26.778 --> 01:36:29.489
<i>- Take him, he's right there. Kill him.</i>
- I've <i>got Morrison, taking</i> a <i>shot.</i>

1516
01:36:32.075 --> 01:36:34.577
<i>A little too close for comfort, kid.</i>

1517
01:36:34.786 --> 01:36:35.954
What just happened?

1518
01:36:36.037 --> 01:36:37.497
What the hell is he doing?

1519
01:36:37.956 --> 01:36:39.624
<i>Where are they?
Somebody talk to me.</i>

1520
01:36:39.708 --> 01:36:41.668
<i>Come on,
did that thing crush them or what?</i>

1521
01:36:42.836 --> 01:36:46.381
This was a hell of a lot easier
when it was just three plastic cups.

1522
01:36:50.051 --> 01:36:53.513
Everybody just be cool. Pay attention.
No hasty moves.

1523
01:36:55.056 --> 01:36:58.643
So, you beat a guy like Lynch
by drawing him in with three things.

1524
01:36:59.144 --> 01:37:00.645
What the hell are they doing?

1525
01:37:00.729 --> 01:37:01.855
Distraction.

1526
01:37:04.482 --> 01:37:07.193
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?

1527
01:37:09.029 --> 01:37:10.405
Diversion.

1528
01:37:14.909 --> 01:37:17.454
This is a diversion!
Stay eagle on those containers.

1529
01:37:18.663 --> 01:37:20.332
They're breaking for the exits! Open fire!

1530
01:37:20.415 --> 01:37:22.167
Do not engage! Back off!

1531
01:37:22.334 --> 01:37:23.918
<i>Ground teams, engage!</i>

1532
01:37:27.672 --> 01:37:29.090
Holy shit!

1533
01:37:34.721 --> 01:37:36.181
Ground team, re-engage.

1534
01:37:36.348 --> 01:37:37.932
You are being played by Smith.

1535
01:37:38.016 --> 01:37:40.894
<i>He's trying to draw your eye line, Lynch.
Come on, be smart.</i>

1536
01:37:40.977 --> 01:37:42.187
Take them! Take them!
Take them! Take them!

1537
01:37:45.231 --> 01:37:48.610
Contact! Tower house and bow!
It's Peck and Baracus!

1538
01:37:55.408 --> 01:37:56.493
And division.

1539
01:37:58.328 --> 01:38:00.580
It's a trap! Pull back! Pull back!

1540
01:38:00.663 --> 01:38:02.415
- Get the hell out of there!
- No, no, no.

1541
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:11.049
What is happening? What is going on?

1542
01:38:11.591 --> 01:38:12.884
Nice one, kid.

1543
01:38:13.051 --> 01:38:14.594
<i>It's Peck and Baracus!</i>

1544
01:38:14.677 --> 01:38:16.262
- Shoot them!
- Shut up! I know what I'm doing.

1545
01:38:16.346 --> 01:38:19.057
Okay, paintballers, time to go pro.

1546
01:38:22.227 --> 01:38:23.937
B.A., get to your secondary position.

1547
01:38:26.022 --> 01:38:27.565
Okay. Game-changer.

1548
01:38:27.649 --> 01:38:30.568
Here's what I think of
your best-laid plans.

1549
01:38:32.737 --> 01:38:33.738
Shit!

1550
01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:39.035
Jesus Christ!

1551
01:38:39.369 --> 01:38:41.788
So much for the grand scheme, Smith.

1552
01:38:41.913 --> 01:38:42.997
What the hell was that?

1553
01:38:43.081 --> 01:38:44.874
<i>Face, what the hell was that?</i>

1554
01:38:44.958 --> 01:38:48.002
Pike hit the ship with a SMAW!
He punched a hole in the hull!

1555
01:38:48.086 --> 01:38:49.504
What about the plan?

1556
01:38:49.587 --> 01:38:52.048
<i>Pike just blew up the plan!
We are ad-libbing!</i>

1557
01:38:52.132 --> 01:38:53.508
Bosco, get out of there!

1558
01:38:53.591 --> 01:38:54.926
I'm going for Hannibal.

1559
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:57.929
- Cover me. I'm going for those plates.
- Yes, sir.

1560
01:39:02.434 --> 01:39:05.228
The boat is going over! Get out of there!

1561
01:39:05.311 --> 01:39:06.771
Bos, hang on!

1562
01:40:51.938 --> 01:40:53.564
Oh! Jeez!

1563
01:40:55.775 --> 01:40:56.859
Shit.

1564
01:40:56.943 --> 01:41:00.321
Bosco, Pike's got the high ground.
I'm running low on ammo, man.

1565
01:41:12.708 --> 01:41:13.960
Shit!

1566
01:41:14.126 --> 01:41:16.295
How are you doing, handsome?

1567
01:41:16.587 --> 01:41:19.048
Shit, can you cycle that weapon.
Nice work.

1568
01:41:19.131 --> 01:41:21.008
Jeez, close friends and bullets.

1569
01:41:21.092 --> 01:41:22.468
Where are they when you need them?

1570
01:41:25.721 --> 01:41:28.516
Don't take this too personally,
but look here,

1571
01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:31.394
smile, wait for the flash.

1572
01:41:34.814 --> 01:41:36.065
Baracus.

1573
01:41:46.784 --> 01:41:49.078
Bosco!

1574
01:42:01.674 --> 01:42:02.883
Lynch.

1575
01:42:06.429 --> 01:42:07.722
Lynch.

1576
01:42:10.766 --> 01:42:11.934
Lynch.

1577
01:42:14.729 --> 01:42:16.272
Come on, Lynch.

1578
01:42:20.109 --> 01:42:21.277
Lynch.

1579
01:42:23.904 --> 01:42:26.365
Come on, Smith! Stop bullshitting.

1580
01:42:26.824 --> 01:42:29.118
Lynch. Come on, Lynch.

1581
01:42:33.622 --> 01:42:34.874
Lynch...

1582
01:42:35.541 --> 01:42:36.917
Where am I?

1583
01:42:40.087 --> 01:42:41.630
Come on, Lynch.

1584
01:42:44.467 --> 01:42:45.676
Lynch.

1585
01:42:46.427 --> 01:42:48.346
Where am I, Lynch?

1586
01:42:49.847 --> 01:42:51.515
Come on, Lynch.

1587
01:42:51.599 --> 01:42:54.769
Lynch, Lynch, Lynch, Lynch.

1588
01:42:56.312 --> 01:42:57.646
Lynch!

1589
01:43:11.786 --> 01:43:16.499
There you are, Hannibal.
Been looking all over for you.

1590
01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.668
Hey, don't let the scarf fool you.

1591
01:43:19.752 --> 01:43:23.839
My muay Thai is pretty good.
My jujitsu is a little better, but...

1592
01:43:24.006 --> 01:43:27.802
You had this whole sleight-of-hand thing
going with the containers

1593
01:43:27.885 --> 01:43:31.347
and the cars, and the fireworks.
"Lynch, Lynch, Lynch!"

1594
01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:37.520
God, that's annoying.
But you give Pike a rocket.

1595
01:43:38.854 --> 01:43:40.940
There's your monkey wrench.

1596
01:43:41.190 --> 01:43:42.441
Hannibal, <i>don't do this.</i>

1597
01:43:42.525 --> 01:43:46.779
You know, Smith, you could have
the best recipe in the world...

1598
01:43:46.862 --> 01:43:48.739
- You owe me that much.
- but you drop a few bullets

1599
01:43:48.823 --> 01:43:50.449
<i>- into the batter...
- Hannibal, don't do this.</i>

1600
01:43:50.533 --> 01:43:52.701
<i>- Lynch, no!
- Hannibal, please.</i>

1601
01:43:52.785 --> 01:43:54.120
Oh, God.

1602
01:43:55.955 --> 01:43:57.998
And that cake don't bake.

1603
01:43:58.082 --> 01:44:01.794
Uh-oh. Your witness,
your gun, your problem.

1604
01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:07.758
You served your country well. Excuse me.

1605
01:44:13.514 --> 01:44:16.434
Hello, Ben,
where have you been all my life?

1606
01:44:18.644 --> 01:44:21.730
Look at us, Hannibal.
Couple of grown men.

1607
01:44:21.939 --> 01:44:24.275
I'm bleeding. You're bleeding.

1608
01:44:24.442 --> 01:44:27.111
Don't get up.

1609
01:44:33.492 --> 01:44:35.161
God damn it!

1610
01:44:35.703 --> 01:44:38.539
Your muay Thai is as bad
as your jujitsu, Lynch.

1611
01:44:40.499 --> 01:44:42.460
Better stick with a gun.

1612
01:44:42.543 --> 01:44:45.796
You put a loaded weapon in my hand,
I'll put a bullet in your head.

1613
01:45:01.854 --> 01:45:04.190
I told you I would shoot you.

1614
01:45:05.441 --> 01:45:07.359
Kevlar saved your life.

1615
01:45:07.693 --> 01:45:10.529
Thing is, it doesn't do much good
if I pop you in the head.

1616
01:45:10.613 --> 01:45:12.740
It does if you melt it down.

1617
01:45:14.366 --> 01:45:15.910
MORRISON; <i>Hannibal, don't do this.</i>

1618
01:45:15.993 --> 01:45:18.162
<i>- Hannibal, please.
- So, you beat a guy like that</i>

1619
01:45:18.245 --> 01:45:20.206
by drawing him in with three things.

1620
01:45:20.789 --> 01:45:23.292
- Distraction.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?

1621
01:45:23.375 --> 01:45:24.877
<i>Diversion.</i>

1622
01:45:25.377 --> 01:45:26.504
And division.

1623
01:45:29.965 --> 01:45:31.133
<i>Hannibal, don't leave me alive.</i>

1624
01:45:31.217 --> 01:45:34.220
Then you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

1625
01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.016
What the...

1626
01:45:53.614 --> 01:45:55.032
That's good.

1627
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:58.681
Surprise.

1628
01:46:00.307 --> 01:46:01.308
Agent Burress.

1629
01:46:02.518 --> 01:46:04.145
What did you call me?

1630
01:46:04.979 --> 01:46:06.981
Agent Vance Burress?
Isn't that your name?

1631
01:46:07.064 --> 01:46:09.608
At least that's the name I've got
on this warrant here,

1632
01:46:09.692 --> 01:46:13.863
and unless you have a piece of paper
that looks exactly like...

1633
01:46:15.031 --> 01:46:17.450
No, that wouldn't help you either.

1634
01:46:17.867 --> 01:46:19.201
Easy, easy.

1635
01:46:21.495 --> 01:46:23.456
You're under arrest for attempted murder,

1636
01:46:23.539 --> 01:46:25.666
violations of the Civil False Claims Act,

1637
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:29.295
and the theft of top secret
government engraving plates.

1638
01:46:29.378 --> 01:46:30.546
Easy.

1639
01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:35.301
I guess the plan went okay,

1640
01:46:35.384 --> 01:46:39.013
considering Pike did blow up the boat,
which I didn't account for at all.

1641
01:46:39.096 --> 01:46:41.140
Bullets didn't go through.

1642
01:46:42.266 --> 01:46:43.726
<i>Hannibal, don't do this.
Hannibal, please.</i>

1643
01:46:43.809 --> 01:46:45.811
How are you feeling, man?

1644
01:46:46.103 --> 01:46:47.605
Not... Not good.

1645
01:46:47.688 --> 01:46:49.732
- What's wrong?
- Not good.

1646
01:46:50.274 --> 01:46:52.193
I feel sane.

1647
01:46:52.276 --> 01:46:54.528
I should have shot you in the head
a long time ago.

1648
01:46:54.695 --> 01:46:56.781
Okay, Agent
Burress, that will be all.

1649
01:46:56.864 --> 01:46:59.742
Let's take him out of here, guys.
Go ahead, princess.

1650
01:47:03.746 --> 01:47:07.541
What's the difference between
a concussion and a contusion?

1651
01:47:08.542 --> 01:47:11.045
- It don't matter, bro. You tore up.
- Murdock, that was beautiful.

1652
01:47:11.128 --> 01:47:12.713
You were right. The helmet worked.

1653
01:47:12.797 --> 01:47:14.840
Ketchup worked great.

1654
01:47:15.549 --> 01:47:17.760
You did a great job. You okay?

1655
01:47:17.843 --> 01:47:19.011
- Yeah.
- Got your bell rung?

1656
01:47:19.095 --> 01:47:22.765
Just let Hannibal
make the plans next time.

1657
01:47:23.265 --> 01:47:25.392
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay?

1658
01:47:25.726 --> 01:47:27.353
How's the conscience, big guy?

1659
01:47:29.063 --> 01:47:30.314
At peace.

1660
01:47:40.523 --> 01:47:42.149
Keep it turning.

1661
01:47:43.025 --> 01:47:44.402
We already got them on the exits.

1662
01:47:44.485 --> 01:47:47.071
- We got a two-mile no-fly zone here.
- Which one of you is Sosa?

1663
01:47:47.154 --> 01:47:48.739
- I am. I am.
- I need to talk to Sosa.

1664
01:47:48.823 --> 01:47:50.574
As of right now your prisoner
is to be remanded

1665
01:47:50.658 --> 01:47:52.493
- into federal custody.
- I have a warrant for this man.

1666
01:47:52.576 --> 01:47:55.162
- As of right now...
- I'll tell you what... I'm a doc.

1667
01:47:55.246 --> 01:47:56.747
Let me doctor you up. Let me help you out.

1668
01:47:56.831 --> 01:47:59.083
Do you need stitches?
Please tell me you need stitches.

1669
01:47:59.166 --> 01:48:00.584
I can stitch you up really good.

1670
01:48:02.211 --> 01:48:03.546
Gentlemen.

1671
01:48:05.715 --> 01:48:07.049
The Central Intelligence Agency

1672
01:48:07.133 --> 01:48:09.468
believes in and evinces
a profound moral ethic,

1673
01:48:09.552 --> 01:48:11.804
as well as an unshakeable
professional standard.

1674
01:48:11.887 --> 01:48:16.058
As such, we would like to extend
our most sincere apologies

1675
01:48:16.142 --> 01:48:17.560
for what's happened here.

1676
01:48:18.978 --> 01:48:21.856
- Good day and God bless.
- Where are you taking him?

1677
01:48:24.567 --> 01:48:25.651
Who?

1678
01:48:30.823 --> 01:48:32.408
I never got your name.

1679
01:48:34.994 --> 01:48:36.662
My name is Lynch.

1680
01:48:38.539 --> 01:48:40.124
Of course it is.

1681
01:48:42.710 --> 01:48:44.086
Did he just say Lynch?

1682
01:48:48.507 --> 01:48:49.842
Let it go.

1683
01:48:56.349 --> 01:48:57.558
Hey. Do not touch me.

1684
01:48:58.392 --> 01:48:59.685
Take it easy, guys.

1685
01:48:59.769 --> 01:49:02.438
Everybody, stand down!
Stand down!

1686
01:49:02.521 --> 01:49:05.441
- Get those plates.
- Everybody, stand down!

1687
01:49:05.524 --> 01:49:08.277
- That's an order. Hey, you, stand down.
- What is wrong with you?

1688
01:49:08.361 --> 01:49:09.570
Lieutenant.

1689
01:49:09.653 --> 01:49:10.821
Sir, when did you arrive? I had no idea...

1690
01:49:10.905 --> 01:49:12.782
- Just give me a minute.
- Yes, sir.

1691
01:49:14.283 --> 01:49:16.369
Get your hands off me, tough guy.

1692
01:49:20.081 --> 01:49:23.376
Well, that's one hell of a mess.
But we did get the plates.

1693
01:49:24.794 --> 01:49:28.047
Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to charge
you all with escaping lawful custody.

1694
01:49:28.130 --> 01:49:29.840
What? Hannibal,
what is this guy talking about?

1695
01:49:29.924 --> 01:49:33.636
B.A., we were wrongly convicted, but
it's still illegal to break out of jail.

1696
01:49:33.719 --> 01:49:35.054
Director McCready, Smith and his team

1697
01:49:35.137 --> 01:49:36.597
were instrumental
in recovering those plates.

1698
01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:40.768
They're still level-10 federal fugitives
and I need that off my desk.

1699
01:49:40.851 --> 01:49:42.853
This is chickenshit, sir.

1700
01:49:43.104 --> 01:49:45.356
Yeah, well, you know what?
Perhaps for them, it is chickenshit,

1701
01:49:45.439 --> 01:49:48.818
but for you, Captain, we're re-promoting
you to your former rank.

1702
01:49:48.901 --> 01:49:50.236
So, look, they're gonna be delivered

1703
01:49:50.319 --> 01:49:51.862
to the U.S. Marshals Service
here in Long Beach.

1704
01:49:51.946 --> 01:49:53.781
- And there should be a C-5 transport...
- I understand, but...

1705
01:49:53.864 --> 01:49:55.157
on the tarmac in half an hour.

1706
01:49:55.241 --> 01:49:57.660
- This needs to be done.
- This is really unfair, sir.

1707
01:49:57.952 --> 01:50:00.413
- This is bullshit.
- I'm like Harry Houdini.

1708
01:50:00.871 --> 01:50:02.123
I chew through your cuffs.

1709
01:50:02.206 --> 01:50:04.959
Get up. Step up. Get in there!
Step up!

1710
01:50:05.042 --> 01:50:07.294
- Let's go. Get moving.
- Stop. Wait, stop.

1711
01:50:07.378 --> 01:50:09.088
- Move it.
- Wait.

1712
01:50:09.672 --> 01:50:11.340
- This is so wrong.
- It got a little aggressive.

1713
01:50:11.424 --> 01:50:12.925
- Don't worry about it.
- This is really, really wrong,

1714
01:50:13.008 --> 01:50:15.511
and I'm going to do everything I can
to fix it.

1715
01:50:15.594 --> 01:50:18.180
- I know you will.
- I'm so sorry, Face.

1716
01:50:54.175 --> 01:50:55.759
Nice plan, Face.

1717
01:50:56.302 --> 01:51:00.097
Yeah. We just traded Lynches,
and we're going back to prison.

1718
01:51:00.222 --> 01:51:02.141
We returned the plates.
We can hold our heads high.

1719
01:51:02.224 --> 01:51:03.434
We did the right thing.

1720
01:51:03.517 --> 01:51:06.687
Yeah, and look what they did to us.
This is some bullshit.

1721
01:51:06.770 --> 01:51:08.939
They burned us again, Hannibal.

1722
01:51:09.064 --> 01:51:11.859
We trusted the system and it turned on us.

1723
01:51:11.942 --> 01:51:15.070
Remember, boys, no matter
how random things might appear,

1724
01:51:15.154 --> 01:51:17.698
there is still a plan. Kid.

1725
01:51:18.574 --> 01:51:22.411
Well, I don't mean
to steal your line, boss, but...

1726
01:51:29.752 --> 01:51:32.671
- Yeah.
- I love it when a plan comes together.

1727
01:51:38.219 --> 01:51:39.803
<i>Still wanted by the government,</i>

1728
01:51:40.346 --> 01:51:43.015
<i>they survive as soldiers of fortune.</i>

1729
01:51:45.226 --> 01:51:47.311
<i>If you have a problem,</i>

1730
01:51:48.312 --> 01:51:50.314
<i>if no one else can help,</i>

1731
01:51:51.273 --> 01:51:53.275
<i>and if you can find them,</i>

1732
01:51:53.484 --> 01:51:55.277
<i>maybe you can hire</i>

1733
01:51:57.863 --> 01:51:59.323
<i>the A-Team.</i>

1734
01:57:21.349 --> 01:57:22.642
Yeah!

1735
01:58:06.728 --> 01:58:09.355
- Yo, how is the new bed?
- Beautiful.

1736
01:58:13.151 --> 01:58:14.903
Listen, I know this is good for the body,

1737
01:58:14.986 --> 01:58:17.322
but how do you protect the face?

1738
01:58:17.572 --> 01:58:18.740
Eh...

1739
01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:21.367
You don't mess with it, kid.

1740
01:58:22.911 --> 01:58:23.953
Gotcha.

1741
01:58:24.037 --> 01:58:26.206
Oh, yeah. Is that all you got?

1742
01:58:26.289 --> 01:58:28.082
- Here we go.
- Clear.

1743
01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:30.084
Yee-ha!

1744
01:58:30.793 --> 01:58:33.004
This guy Murdock is nuts.

1745
01:58:33.296 --> 01:58:37.926
I wonder if he's... nuts
or whether he's, you know... nuts.

1746
01:58:40.678 --> 01:58:43.806
Yeah, I think
I might have felt something there.
