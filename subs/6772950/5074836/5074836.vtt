00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:24.008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get a pack of Morleys?</font>

2
00:01:26.844 --> 00:01:29.378
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Cigarillos? Comprende?</i></font>

3
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.015
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Si, si.</i></font>

4
00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:43.224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

5
00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:55.705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare, Giselle?</font>

6
00:01:55.707 --> 00:01:57.105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

7
00:01:57.107 --> 00:01:59.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, I don't want
to play anymore. Please.</font>

8
00:01:59.243 --> 00:02:02.812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth... or... dare?</font>

9
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no! No!</font>

10
00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:16.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.</font>

11
00:02:30.307 --> 00:02:32.307
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You do have a choice.</i></font>

12
00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I can honestly say
the pure joy you will feel</font>

13
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:36.512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from literally building
someone's home,</font>

14
00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:39.381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it will stay with you
for the rest of your life.</font>

15
00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:41.383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unlike all the nights
you won't remember</font>

16
00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:44.319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the hangovers you're
really gonna want to forget.</font>

17
00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:46.354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, for a spring break
alternative</font>

18
00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:48.289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that is really good
for the soul,</font>

19
00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:51.827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">please consider
Habitat for Humanity.</font>

20
00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

21
00:02:53.097 --> 00:02:55.097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

22
00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

23
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I've been doing some
thinking, and I forgive you.</font>

24
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- For what?
- For saying you can't come on spring break.</font>

25
00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:05.406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you didn't mean it.</font>

26
00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:07.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Markie.
- Yeah?</font>

27
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:09.944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you so much,
you know that.</font>

28
00:03:09.946 --> 00:03:11.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can't. I already
signed up for Habitat.</font>

29
00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know.
- Yeah. I'm a trip leader.</font>

30
00:03:13.517 --> 00:03:16.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what, I know, I know.
It's just...</font>

31
00:03:16.887 --> 00:03:20.955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is our last
spring break, ever.</font>

32
00:03:20.957 --> 00:03:24.025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the thought of doing that
without my best friend...</font>

33
00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:25.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that breaks my heart.</font>

34
00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since high school, you and I
haven't spent more than a week</font>

35
00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">away from each other.</font>

36
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our last chance
to have some fun</font>

37
00:03:31.936 --> 00:03:34.436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before life tears us apart.</font>

38
00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:37.339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, when you
put it that way...</font>

39
00:03:37.341 --> 00:03:39.942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- No. Still can't.</font>

40
00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:42.510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Olivia,
what ever happened to</font>

41
00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:44.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"between you and the world,
I choose you"?</font>

42
00:03:44.248 --> 00:03:45.480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I still mean that.
- Do you?</font>

43
00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:47.549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, most of the time.
This just...</font>

44
00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:49.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know, isn't
one of those times.</font>

45
00:03:49.886 --> 00:03:51.586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. All right.
You know, I really didn't want</font>

46
00:03:51.588 --> 00:03:54.190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to have to do this, but
you've left me no other choice.</font>

47
00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I un-signed you up.</font>

48
00:03:55.392 --> 00:03:58.092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You what?
- Yeah.</font>

49
00:03:58.094 --> 00:03:59.929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told Habitat
you got shingles.</font>

50
00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:02.230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is kind of funny,
'cause roofs have shingles...</font>

51
00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:03.431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, that is so...</font>

52
00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:05.935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Brilliant.
- Thank you.</font>

53
00:04:05.937 --> 00:04:08.137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, if you come with us
for this 1 week</font>

54
00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of spring break debauchery, we
will all build houses with you</font>

55
00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for 2 weeks over the summer.</font>

56
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We said one week.
- We said two.</font>

57
00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:16.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll help with your
med school applications.</font>

58
00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:17.278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like I need the help.
- He's in.</font>

59
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Full 14 days.</font>

60
00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what's it gonna be, Liv?</font>

61
00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, your feeble set
of hands for one week,</font>

62
00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or all of ours for two?</font>

63
00:04:23.955 --> 00:04:25.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you're really
just being selfish</font>

64
00:04:25.323 --> 00:04:27.356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you don't come with us.</font>

65
00:04:34.532 --> 00:04:35.998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

66
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you put in here?</font>

67
00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:38.967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoes.</font>

68
00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It worked?
- Well, that depends.</font>

69
00:04:41.104 --> 00:04:43.104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you really gonna help me
build houses this summer?</font>

70
00:04:43.106 --> 00:04:44.939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had me at
"boys with tools."</font>

71
00:04:44.941 --> 00:04:47.208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Markie's nothing
if not persistent.</font>

72
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep, that is
her most annoying quality.</font>

73
00:04:53.217 --> 00:04:55.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glad you're with us,
Girl Scout.</font>

74
00:04:55.286 --> 00:04:57.219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know we've always
been a package deal.</font>

75
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:00.054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.
I'm well aware of that.</font>

76
00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:02.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you?
- Yeah. I'm okay with it.</font>

77
00:05:02.092 --> 00:05:03.592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm.</font>

78
00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:05.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You ready?
- So ready.</font>

79
00:05:05.462 --> 00:05:07.897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, let's go.
- Let's do it.</font>

80
00:05:09.032 --> 00:05:11.133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do we have everything?
- Yeah.</font>

81
00:05:11.135 --> 00:05:13.068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we do.</font>

82
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow, ow! Spring break, bitches!</font>

83
00:05:15.306 --> 00:05:19.008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right, bitches!</font>

84
00:05:29.053 --> 00:05:32.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Viva la Mexico!</i></font>

85
00:05:32.022 --> 00:05:33.989
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There it is!</i></font>

86
00:05:33.991 --> 00:05:35.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We're in Mexico.</i></font>

87
00:05:35.926 --> 00:05:38.693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yay! Rosarito! Spring break!
- Spring break!</font>

88
00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:41.597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's ready for some cervezas?</font>

89
00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Margaritas.
- Actually, this is, like, our fourth.</font>

90
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:45.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

91
00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:47.535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I love you.
<i>- Such a babe.</i></font>

92
00:05:47.537 --> 00:05:50.539
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- My God.
- What about me?</i></font>

93
00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:52.073
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Mexico!</i></font>

94
00:05:52.075 --> 00:05:54.176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tyson... is about to run
into the water</font>

95
00:05:54.178 --> 00:05:56.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and get eaten by a shark.</font>

96
00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:58.313
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Spring break!
- Beer run. Let's go!</i></font>

97
00:05:58.315 --> 00:06:01.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not drunk yet.</font>

98
00:06:01.284 --> 00:06:03.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you straight? Are you
straight? Are you straight?</font>

99
00:06:03.053 --> 00:06:04.453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All poles, no holes.</font>

100
00:06:04.455 --> 00:06:06.054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know that.</font>

101
00:06:06.056 --> 00:06:09.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- <i>Get a room.</i>
- Lonely souls here at the bar.</font>

102
00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Drink. Drink.
<i>- Oh.</i></font>

103
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:13.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sand dollar!
Lucky charm.</font>

104
00:06:13.563 --> 00:06:16.532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sober friend right here.
- Huh? Not!</font>

105
00:06:21.705 --> 00:06:24.672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There, there. Yeah!
Oh, shit! Oh, my...</font>

106
00:06:24.674 --> 00:06:27.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- I love it.
- Nice!</i></font>

107
00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mwah! Whoo!</font>

108
00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you guys watch this later,</font>

109
00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:34.183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I love you, Markie.
- Soul brothers.</font>

110
00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love you, Liv.</font>

111
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Love you, Pen. Love you, Brad. I love you, Ty.
- Yes, we are...</font>

112
00:06:38.688 --> 00:06:41.657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's leave these losers
behind. Let's go.</font>

113
00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:43.157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I just want to go
to one more bar.</font>

114
00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.160
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Ole!
- Ole!</i></font>

115
00:06:45.162 --> 00:06:46.427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I want to lay you.</font>

116
00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:48.097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go back to the hotel.
Come on.</font>

117
00:06:58.476 --> 00:07:00.174
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Uno! Dos!</i></font>

118
00:07:00.176 --> 00:07:02.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!</i></font>

119
00:07:12.155 --> 00:07:13.655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

120
00:07:13.657 --> 00:07:15.493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are really going for it.</font>

121
00:07:16.524 --> 00:07:19.294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if you can't beat 'em...</font>

122
00:07:19.296 --> 00:07:22.097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh-hoo-hoo. Mm-hmm.
- Just like that?</font>

123
00:07:31.741 --> 00:07:35.544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Tell me what's going on.</font>

124
00:07:35.546 --> 00:07:39.347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, last night
in Mexico, and...</font>

125
00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:41.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we're the only two losers
not dancing.</font>

126
00:07:41.652 --> 00:07:44.219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm. If you can
call that dancing.</font>

127
00:07:44.221 --> 00:07:46.157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Definitely not.</font>

128
00:07:50.327 --> 00:07:52.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that for your
YouTube channel?</font>

129
00:07:52.563 --> 00:07:54.296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No.</font>

130
00:07:54.298 --> 00:07:56.297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">YouTube's for
my volunteer stuff,</font>

131
00:07:56.299 --> 00:07:58.434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Snapchats are just for fun.</font>

132
00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, I'm gonna go
to the señoritas.</font>

133
00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:03.237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll be right back.
- Okay.</font>

134
00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:05.239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on.</font>

135
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:07.676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I thought you were
done with this shit.</font>

136
00:08:07.678 --> 00:08:10.345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're moving in with Lucas, to D.C., remember?
- Yeah. Yeah.</font>

137
00:08:10.347 --> 00:08:13.515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What... what are you doing?
- I'm-I'm sorry.</font>

138
00:08:13.517 --> 00:08:15.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so stupid. I'm just...</font>

139
00:08:15.452 --> 00:08:17.719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just drunk, okay?</font>

140
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:20.058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're seriously
the best friend ever.</font>

141
00:08:21.224 --> 00:08:22.357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

142
00:08:22.359 --> 00:08:23.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're good?
- Yeah.</font>

143
00:08:23.327 --> 00:08:27.662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look who I found
trying and failing to salsa.</font>

144
00:08:27.664 --> 00:08:28.864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool.</font>

145
00:08:28.866 --> 00:08:30.665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I wasn't that bad.
- Hey.</font>

146
00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:31.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- I missed you.</font>

147
00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:33.734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I missed you.
- Welcome back.</font>

148
00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:34.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I missed you, too.</font>

149
00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:36.932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you weren't doing
too well with the salsa, huh?</font>

150
00:08:43.813 --> 00:08:47.349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Olivia! What?
- Ronnie?</font>

151
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:49.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. What are you doing here?</font>

152
00:08:49.452 --> 00:08:51.619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm just skiing. What
do you think I'm doing here?</font>

153
00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:54.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting my spring break on.
Do you want to join me?</font>

154
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:56.358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Thanks.</font>

155
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where's Markie?
Maybe we could do, like,</font>

156
00:08:58.361 --> 00:09:00.428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- you know, a little menage a trois?
- You know what?</font>

157
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's actually
with her boyfriend, Lucas.</font>

158
00:09:02.198 --> 00:09:03.731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about, like,
a menage a dos?</font>

159
00:09:03.733 --> 00:09:06.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not happening, pal.</font>

160
00:09:07.704 --> 00:09:10.239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah?
Is there a problem, pal?</font>

161
00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:12.474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

162
00:09:12.476 --> 00:09:14.743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just surprised she hasn't
punched you in the face yet.</font>

163
00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:17.146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Guess she's nicer than I am.
- Oh, yeah?</font>

164
00:09:17.148 --> 00:09:18.779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about I punch you
in the face? Huh?</font>

165
00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:19.815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't be the worst thing</font>

166
00:09:19.817 --> 00:09:21.149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's happened to me
this week.</font>

167
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:22.183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Ronnie, calm down.</font>

168
00:09:22.185 --> 00:09:24.519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, you got to
let it go.</font>

169
00:09:24.521 --> 00:09:27.221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? I saw Delta Phi in
the back. They're doing shots.</font>

170
00:09:27.223 --> 00:09:29.393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you should
really go check it out.</font>

171
00:09:31.294 --> 00:09:33.427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't say no to shots.
Everyone knows that.</font>

172
00:09:33.429 --> 00:09:35.699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I'm gonna leave,
not 'cause of what you said.</font>

173
00:09:42.173 --> 00:09:43.839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I'm too nice?</font>

174
00:09:43.841 --> 00:09:45.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good thing.</font>

175
00:09:45.409 --> 00:09:47.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except when dealing
with guys at bars, so...</font>

176
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feel free to tell me
to piss off.</font>

177
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I just like being nice.</font>

178
00:09:54.217 --> 00:09:56.250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I give it a shot?</font>

179
00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:00.556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm Carter.
- Olivia.</font>

180
00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:01.956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buy you a drink?</font>

181
00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

182
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another beer,</font>

183
00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:08.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and... a margarita
for the lady.</font>

184
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:14.235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

185
00:10:14.237 --> 00:10:15.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's got to be an all-night
bar around here somewhere.</font>

186
00:10:15.773 --> 00:10:17.773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We still have that tequila
back in the room.</font>

187
00:10:17.775 --> 00:10:18.873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's our last night
in Mexico.</font>

188
00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:20.942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want
to go back to the room.</font>

189
00:10:20.944 --> 00:10:22.911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know a place we can go.</font>

190
00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:26.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm... I'm sorry, who are you?</font>

191
00:10:26.382 --> 00:10:29.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh, it's a bit of a hike, but it's worth it.
- Hmm.</font>

192
00:10:29.653 --> 00:10:32.387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or you can just tell me
to piss off.</font>

193
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:33.854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think, uh...</font>

194
00:10:33.856 --> 00:10:36.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">think the hotel room
sounds pretty good, yeah.</font>

195
00:10:36.293 --> 00:10:38.730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Oh, come on, it's our final spring break.</font>

196
00:10:40.597 --> 00:10:44.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before life tears us apart.</font>

197
00:10:44.768 --> 00:10:46.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

198
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're almost there.</font>

199
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should have worn
my hiking shoes.</font>

200
00:10:56.513 --> 00:10:57.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um... okay.</font>

201
00:10:57.847 --> 00:10:59.815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should I lay down
some bread crumbs?</font>

202
00:10:59.817 --> 00:11:01.219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, guys, be careful.</font>

203
00:11:02.852 --> 00:11:05.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wonder what that means.
How's your Spanish, Brad? Ow.</font>

204
00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:11.628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, guys, let's go.</font>

205
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:21.836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. This place is interesting.</font>

206
00:11:23.406 --> 00:11:25.306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Kind of terrifying.
- Uh...</font>

207
00:11:25.308 --> 00:11:26.941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing
to be afraid of.</font>

208
00:11:26.943 --> 00:11:28.509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Promise.</font>

209
00:11:28.511 --> 00:11:30.778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, yeah, this is
way better than a club.</font>

210
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. You okay?</font>

211
00:11:32.915 --> 00:11:35.316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, yeah. Yeah.</font>

212
00:11:35.318 --> 00:11:38.487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just a little tired.
- Yeah. We won't stay long.</font>

213
00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the tequila?</font>

214
00:11:44.294 --> 00:11:46.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope you've had
your tetanus shot.</font>

215
00:11:46.462 --> 00:11:48.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got to piss.</font>

216
00:11:52.535 --> 00:11:54.905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nice. Thank you.
- Cool, cool. Thanks, man.</font>

217
00:12:35.545 --> 00:12:38.547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

218
00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:39.983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh.</font>

219
00:12:53.697 --> 00:12:56.398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Yo! Chill out, O-dog, it's just me.</font>

220
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ronnie, did you follow me here?</font>

221
00:12:58.702 --> 00:13:00.936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't keep Ron-Ron
from a party.</font>

222
00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:05.706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

223
00:13:05.708 --> 00:13:07.744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This smells horrible.
What is... what...</font>

224
00:13:16.053 --> 00:13:17.952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, beer me, bro.</font>

225
00:13:17.954 --> 00:13:20.788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, great, Ronnie's here.</font>

226
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure thing, bro.</font>

227
00:13:23.025 --> 00:13:25.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, you know, we got to</font>

228
00:13:25.529 --> 00:13:27.461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- get up early, so...
- Yeah. Yeah. Yes.</font>

229
00:13:27.463 --> 00:13:29.998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, yeah.
- You guys just got here.</font>

230
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can't leave now.
- Yeah. What's the rush?</font>

231
00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:34.902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

232
00:13:34.904 --> 00:13:36.738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, let's, uh, let's play
a game or something.</font>

233
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, like spin the bottle.</font>

234
00:13:38.708 --> 00:13:41.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And on that note, let's, uh...
- I was thinking Truth or Dare.</font>

235
00:13:41.812 --> 00:13:44.946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, this a 7th grade
sleepover, or...?</font>

236
00:13:44.948 --> 00:13:47.983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's a kids' game, but,
I mean, if you play it right,</font>

237
00:13:47.985 --> 00:13:51.152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's a chance to expose
your friends' deepest secrets,</font>

238
00:13:51.154 --> 00:13:54.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and... make them do
things they don't want to.</font>

239
00:13:56.193 --> 00:13:58.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That actually does sound
kind of interesting.</font>

240
00:13:58.529 --> 00:14:00.195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

241
00:14:00.197 --> 00:14:01.797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. We're in.</font>

242
00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, everybody, get behind me.</font>

243
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And... 1, 2, 3.
- Smile. <i>Queso.</i></font>

244
00:14:05.869 --> 00:14:09.137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, will you tag me in that? Your boy.</font>

245
00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:11.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glad you're with us, Ronnie.</font>

246
00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:17.112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well?</font>

247
00:14:17.114 --> 00:14:18.814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Olivia, truth or dare?</font>

248
00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:20.949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whoo!
- Hmm.</font>

249
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:23.118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Truth.
- Lame.</font>

250
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um... aliens.</font>

251
00:14:26.689 --> 00:14:28.657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They land right now
and they give you a choice.</font>

252
00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:31.560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They kill everyone
in this room,</font>

253
00:14:31.562 --> 00:14:33.829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then leave
peacefully, or...</font>

254
00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:36.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they kill the entire
population of Mexico,</font>

255
00:14:36.933 --> 00:14:39.468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we escape unscathed.</font>

256
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:40.902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Choose.</font>

257
00:14:40.904 --> 00:14:42.704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of ridiculous
question is that?</font>

258
00:14:42.706 --> 00:14:45.474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's a moral dilemma.
- I don't have morals.</font>

259
00:14:45.476 --> 00:14:47.042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Of course you don't.
- Okay, well, obviously,</font>

260
00:14:47.044 --> 00:14:49.643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- she's choosing us.
- Sorry, guys.</font>

261
00:14:49.645 --> 00:14:52.747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- You're gonna let aliens kill us?</font>

262
00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:54.883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, but millions
of people? Come on.</font>

263
00:14:54.885 --> 00:14:56.750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to tell the truth.</font>

264
00:14:56.752 --> 00:14:59.186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am. It's the only right answer.
- Eh, whatever.</font>

265
00:14:59.188 --> 00:15:01.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm bored
of this already,</font>

266
00:15:01.891 --> 00:15:03.792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so let's get
this party started.</font>

267
00:15:03.794 --> 00:15:05.694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You brought us here.
- Ooh.</font>

268
00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:07.896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, I know how to amp this up
a little bit.</font>

269
00:15:07.898 --> 00:15:10.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why don't we get, like, a little girl-on-girl going?
- No.</font>

270
00:15:10.167 --> 00:15:12.267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ronnie. Truth or dare?
- I'd watch that.</font>

271
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:14.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dare. Duh.</font>

272
00:15:14.004 --> 00:15:16.937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I dare you to give Tyson
a lap dance for 30 seconds.</font>

273
00:15:16.939 --> 00:15:18.840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No way. No. I won't do it.
- Yes. Yep.</font>

274
00:15:18.842 --> 00:15:20.975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once you're asked, you're in.
That's the rules.</font>

275
00:15:20.977 --> 00:15:23.177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, there's, like, 3 chicks
here. You couldn't dare...?</font>

276
00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:24.979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on. Ronnie.
- Yo, this sucks.</font>

277
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:26.147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get over here.
- So wack!</font>

278
00:15:26.149 --> 00:15:28.016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There you go.
- Get it.</font>

279
00:15:28.018 --> 00:15:30.151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yo, no tips, no touching, bro.
- Just do it.</font>

280
00:15:30.153 --> 00:15:31.853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't make this a thing.
- Hold this.</font>

281
00:15:31.855 --> 00:15:33.654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't make this weird.
- This is gonna be the longest</font>

282
00:15:33.656 --> 00:15:35.023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">30 seconds of my life.
Let's go. Come on.</font>

283
00:15:35.025 --> 00:15:36.758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take it off!
- All right!</font>

284
00:15:38.127 --> 00:15:39.226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God!
- Oh! Oh!</font>

285
00:15:39.228 --> 00:15:40.695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's done this before.</font>

286
00:15:40.697 --> 00:15:42.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, I think
he kind of likes this.</font>

287
00:15:42.164 --> 00:15:43.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a real pro here.</font>

288
00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:44.798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that technique.</font>

289
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ronnie!</font>

290
00:15:46.202 --> 00:15:47.268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ronnie! Ronnie!
- He's done this before.</font>

291
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that.</font>

292
00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:50.305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Make it rain pesos!
- I don't want your pesos!</font>

293
00:15:50.307 --> 00:15:53.008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw. Cheer up.</font>

294
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Weird.
- Okay.</font>

295
00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:59.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Lucas,
truth or dare?</font>

296
00:16:10.626 --> 00:16:12.594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, who's ready?</font>

297
00:16:13.996 --> 00:16:16.730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!</font>

298
00:16:18.935 --> 00:16:22.671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, guys, I promise you, it's
just because it's cold in here.</font>

299
00:16:22.673 --> 00:16:24.572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have no judgment.
- Scarred for life.</font>

300
00:16:24.574 --> 00:16:26.240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold your applause, please.</font>

301
00:16:26.242 --> 00:16:27.776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

302
00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:29.076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite the show.</font>

303
00:16:29.078 --> 00:16:30.912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

304
00:16:30.914 --> 00:16:33.648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Markie's turn.</font>

305
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got this one.
Truth or dare?</font>

306
00:16:35.718 --> 00:16:37.719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, truth.</font>

307
00:16:37.721 --> 00:16:41.692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you aware that Olivia
is in love with your boyfriend?</font>

308
00:16:45.928 --> 00:16:48.263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, she's not.
- Come on, it's so obvious.</font>

309
00:16:48.265 --> 00:16:51.266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Will you stop being such an asshole?
- Just being truthful.</font>

310
00:16:51.268 --> 00:16:52.901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Tyson, shut up!
- Don't tell me to shut up.</font>

311
00:16:52.903 --> 00:16:55.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Dude, we're all here</font>

312
00:16:55.204 --> 00:16:56.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because she's trying to make
you jealous, like, clearly.</font>

313
00:16:56.773 --> 00:16:59.306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you always
starting shit, dude?!</font>

314
00:16:59.308 --> 00:17:01.242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Somebody tell the truth, that would be great.
- Just stop it</font>

315
00:17:01.244 --> 00:17:03.878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the agro-posturing and
just get to my turn, please.</font>

316
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Brad, truth or dare?
- Yes. Truth.</font>

317
00:17:06.682 --> 00:17:09.951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you had to make out with
anyone here, who would it be?</font>

318
00:17:09.953 --> 00:17:12.623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay if you're bi-curious.</font>

319
00:17:22.932 --> 00:17:25.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scruffy boy over there.</font>

320
00:17:25.802 --> 00:17:28.869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on!
- I'm flattered.</font>

321
00:17:28.871 --> 00:17:31.071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tyson. Truth or dare?</font>

322
00:17:31.073 --> 00:17:32.640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dare.
- I dare you to stop</font>

323
00:17:32.642 --> 00:17:34.074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">selling forged prescriptions
to freshmen.</font>

324
00:17:34.076 --> 00:17:36.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, shit.
- Olivia.</font>

325
00:17:36.246 --> 00:17:38.013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always with
the moral high ground.</font>

326
00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:40.982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine. I make more money
off upperclassmen anyway.</font>

327
00:17:40.984 --> 00:17:42.417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

328
00:17:42.419 --> 00:17:44.985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, Penelope. Truth or dare?</font>

329
00:17:44.987 --> 00:17:46.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dare.
- Make out with Olivia.</font>

330
00:17:46.723 --> 00:17:49.424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ronnie!
- Why not? Just try... It c-could be fun.</font>

331
00:17:49.426 --> 00:17:51.262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just...
- Didn't see that one coming.</font>

332
00:17:52.963 --> 00:17:55.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, Liv,
just close your eyes</font>

333
00:17:55.332 --> 00:17:58.034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and pretend it's Lucas.
- You know what?</font>

334
00:18:02.005 --> 00:18:04.773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Maybe I'm bi-curious.</font>

335
00:18:04.775 --> 00:18:06.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tight.</font>

336
00:18:06.142 --> 00:18:08.042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's tight.</font>

337
00:18:08.044 --> 00:18:10.712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carter. You're up.</font>

338
00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:12.914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

339
00:18:12.916 --> 00:18:14.349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, truth.</font>

340
00:18:14.351 --> 00:18:17.354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are your intentions
with our sweet Olivia?</font>

341
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I needed to find
someone with friends</font>

342
00:18:26.362 --> 00:18:28.865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I could trick
into coming here.</font>

343
00:18:31.834 --> 00:18:34.301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could tell Olivia
was a pushover,</font>

344
00:18:34.303 --> 00:18:36.239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which made her an easy target.</font>

345
00:18:40.209 --> 00:18:43.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought you all up here
to play this game</font>

346
00:18:43.246 --> 00:18:46.981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because...</font>

347
00:18:46.983 --> 00:18:51.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm okay with strangers dying
if it means I get to live.</font>

348
00:18:51.487 --> 00:18:53.855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

349
00:18:53.857 --> 00:18:56.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, but you should've
told me to piss off.</font>

350
00:19:00.897 --> 00:19:03.298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, what's up?</font>

351
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

352
00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:09.303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I know, it sounds insane,
but the game is real.</font>

353
00:19:09.305 --> 00:19:10.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once you're asked, you're in.</font>

354
00:19:10.173 --> 00:19:12.240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? Wherever you go,
whatever you do,</font>

355
00:19:12.242 --> 00:19:13.974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it'll find you.
Hey, don't, don't.</font>

356
00:19:13.976 --> 00:19:17.378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell the truth or you die.
Do the dare or you die.</font>

357
00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Refuse to play and...</font>

358
00:19:20.816 --> 00:19:24.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just... just-just
follow the rules.</font>

359
00:19:39.902 --> 00:19:41.838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys?</font>

360
00:19:43.506 --> 00:19:45.275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys?</font>

361
00:19:55.185 --> 00:19:57.021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

362
00:19:59.121 --> 00:20:01.156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

363
00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:03.093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

364
00:20:05.428 --> 00:20:07.829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guy's a jerk.</font>

365
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:10.098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want to get out of here?</font>

366
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Great way
to end the trip, Liv.</font>

367
00:20:14.303 --> 00:20:17.539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I didn't like
that guy anyways.</font>

368
00:20:17.541 --> 00:20:20.410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, we can go sleep in.</font>

369
00:20:27.918 --> 00:20:29.417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man, see you in class.</font>

370
00:20:29.419 --> 00:20:32.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coffee later.</font>

371
00:20:33.456 --> 00:20:35.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure you make it
home next weekend, son.</font>

372
00:20:35.492 --> 00:20:37.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha.</font>

373
00:20:38.928 --> 00:20:40.895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

374
00:20:40.897 --> 00:20:42.496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

375
00:20:42.498 --> 00:20:44.499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All good with Officer Dad?</font>

376
00:20:44.501 --> 00:20:46.167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, absolutely.</font>

377
00:20:46.169 --> 00:20:48.336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that he thinks
I spent my last week</font>

378
00:20:48.338 --> 00:20:51.039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">belly-bumping my nonexistent
girlfriend in wine country.</font>

379
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:53.875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, your Canadian lady, she
really does like a good Merlot.</font>

380
00:20:53.877 --> 00:20:55.342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, her name is Kimberly,</font>

381
00:20:55.344 --> 00:20:57.878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and her palate is quite refined, thank you.
- Oh.</font>

382
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. My apologies
to Canadian Kim.</font>

383
00:21:00.316 --> 00:21:03.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remind why I didn't go to
school thousands of miles away</font>

384
00:21:03.253 --> 00:21:05.253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from my overbearing
and homophobic father.</font>

385
00:21:05.255 --> 00:21:07.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Because you never say no to him.
- Hmm.</font>

386
00:21:07.923 --> 00:21:10.190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you never would've met me.</font>

387
00:21:10.192 --> 00:21:12.627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure you don't
want to be my beard?</font>

388
00:21:12.629 --> 00:21:14.963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I really want to ghost Kimberly.</font>

389
00:21:14.965 --> 00:21:17.398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I doubt that would solve
either of our problems.</font>

390
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How is Markie?
- I don't know.</font>

391
00:21:20.003 --> 00:21:22.936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Haven't talked to her much
since we've been back.</font>

392
00:21:22.938 --> 00:21:25.572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about us.
We're friends for life.</font>

393
00:21:25.574 --> 00:21:28.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye.
- See ya.</font>

394
00:21:31.614 --> 00:21:34.418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi, Olivia.
- Hey.</font>

395
00:22:03.446 --> 00:22:06.015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here you go.
- God bless you.</font>

396
00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:11.151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. We made mojitos!</font>

397
00:22:11.153 --> 00:22:12.587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Study party?</font>

398
00:22:12.589 --> 00:22:14.656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, maybe later.
- Oh, okay.</font>

399
00:22:14.658 --> 00:22:16.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Olivia,</font>

400
00:22:16.092 --> 00:22:18.158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">um, Pen was saying that I was</font>

401
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a bit of dick in Mexico, so...
here's a little something</font>

402
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- to make it up to you.
- A prescription?</font>

403
00:22:25.368 --> 00:22:28.636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? You're not a freshman.
- Yeah, you're not a doctor.</font>

404
00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:32.141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's... not
what my lucky pen says.</font>

405
00:22:34.945 --> 00:22:36.945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I was your lucky Pen.</font>

406
00:22:36.947 --> 00:22:39.981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, baby, but you are
my lucky Penelope.</font>

407
00:22:39.983 --> 00:22:43.117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my lucky Pen! Oh! Oh!
- Tyson! Tyson!</font>

408
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:37.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roy Cameron, 45 years old,
attempts to make dinner.</font>

409
00:23:37.006 --> 00:23:38.438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take one.</font>

410
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little faith, please.</font>

411
00:23:40.342 --> 00:23:42.642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody makes a steak
like your old man.</font>

412
00:23:42.644 --> 00:23:45.379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, Dad, I'm pescatarian now.</font>

413
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:48.715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. And that's
why I meant to say...</font>

414
00:23:48.717 --> 00:23:52.619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">swordfish steaks! Boom!</font>

415
00:23:52.621 --> 00:23:56.224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- God, you are such a dork.
- But you still love me, right?</font>

416
00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:58.559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, I still love you.</font>

417
00:23:58.561 --> 00:24:00.261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

418
00:24:20.483 --> 00:24:22.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry.
- Hi.</font>

419
00:24:22.284 --> 00:24:23.751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come bearing gifts.</font>

420
00:24:23.753 --> 00:24:25.586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Penelope said
you didn't want one.</font>

421
00:24:25.588 --> 00:24:27.421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you better than that.</font>

422
00:24:27.423 --> 00:24:29.557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you're right.
Probably could use a drink.</font>

423
00:24:29.559 --> 00:24:32.560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I know things have been...</font>

424
00:24:32.562 --> 00:24:35.096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a little Bette and Joan
between us</font>

425
00:24:35.098 --> 00:24:38.398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">since Mexico, but...
awkwardness stops here.</font>

426
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? And since my dad
took his life,</font>

427
00:24:40.769 --> 00:24:43.538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">y-you've been my only family.</font>

428
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one person
I can really trust.</font>

429
00:24:46.208 --> 00:24:48.475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'm not gonna let
a stupid comment by Tyson,</font>

430
00:24:48.477 --> 00:24:50.711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of all people, change that.</font>

431
00:24:50.713 --> 00:24:54.182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, I promise you,</font>

432
00:24:54.184 --> 00:24:57.350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not have feelings
for your boyfriend.</font>

433
00:24:57.352 --> 00:25:01.254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's like a brother
to me, okay?</font>

434
00:25:01.256 --> 00:25:03.390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Yeah.</font>

435
00:25:03.392 --> 00:25:05.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Between you and the world,
I choose you.</font>

436
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I choose you.</font>

437
00:25:10.699 --> 00:25:12.699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm. Oh, my gosh.</font>

438
00:25:12.701 --> 00:25:14.267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That is...
- Wow.</font>

439
00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:15.703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...very strong.
- Yeah.</font>

440
00:25:25.747 --> 00:25:27.415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about
your mom, and, like,</font>

441
00:25:27.417 --> 00:25:29.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it just happens sometimes...</font>

442
00:25:29.284 --> 00:25:31.252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, asshole.</font>

443
00:25:31.254 --> 00:25:33.253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think that's funny?</font>

444
00:25:33.255 --> 00:25:34.658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think what's funny?</font>

445
00:25:36.758 --> 00:25:38.559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I-I don't get it.</font>

446
00:25:38.561 --> 00:25:40.394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My desk and the flyer
were harmless,</font>

447
00:25:40.396 --> 00:25:42.863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's gonna cost me
a lot of money to fix my car.</font>

448
00:25:42.865 --> 00:25:45.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I am so lost right now.
What are you talking about?</font>

449
00:25:45.567 --> 00:25:47.767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keyed "truth or dare"
into my car door.</font>

450
00:25:47.769 --> 00:25:49.837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing on your car.</font>

451
00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:51.705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except your idea
of a lame joke.</font>

452
00:25:51.707 --> 00:25:53.608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you're a little crazy.
But you know what?</font>

453
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually happen
to like crazy.</font>

454
00:25:55.178 --> 00:25:56.511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want to maybe
get a drink sometime?</font>

455
00:25:56.513 --> 00:25:58.713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you just
leave me alone? Okay?</font>

456
00:25:58.715 --> 00:26:00.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that a no?</font>

457
00:26:04.586 --> 00:26:06.587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Sarah,
have you seen Markie?</font>

458
00:26:06.589 --> 00:26:08.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the library.</font>

459
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Olivia.</font>

460
00:26:17.199 --> 00:26:19.332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

461
00:26:19.334 --> 00:26:21.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you say?</font>

462
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

463
00:26:26.743 --> 00:26:30.844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?
Truth or dare?</font>

464
00:26:30.846 --> 00:26:32.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare? Truth or dare?</font>

465
00:26:32.849 --> 00:26:34.615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

466
00:26:34.617 --> 00:26:36.551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare? Truth or dare?</font>

467
00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:39.387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?
Truth or dare?</font>

468
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:41.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Truth or dare? Truth or dare?
- Truth! Stop!</font>

469
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What secret does
your best friend make you hide?</font>

470
00:26:43.659 --> 00:26:45.795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie's constantly
cheating on Lucas!</font>

471
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That true?</font>

472
00:26:57.473 --> 00:26:59.276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie...</font>

473
00:27:01.678 --> 00:27:03.613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luke.</font>

474
00:27:05.681 --> 00:27:07.581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucas.</font>

475
00:27:07.583 --> 00:27:10.784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait.
- Markie, I don't know what's going on.</font>

476
00:27:10.786 --> 00:27:12.352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's like a brother to you?</font>

477
00:27:12.354 --> 00:27:14.589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm serious.
I'm seeing things.</font>

478
00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:17.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Touch me again,
and I'll break that hand.</font>

479
00:27:37.246 --> 00:27:39.879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's insane.
- Seriously.</font>

480
00:27:39.881 --> 00:27:42.750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo. 'Sup?
You want to play?</font>

481
00:27:42.752 --> 00:27:44.517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like a girl
who's good with balls.</font>

482
00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:47.655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please do not talk to me.</font>

483
00:27:47.657 --> 00:27:49.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, look, uh, just one game.</font>

484
00:27:49.324 --> 00:27:51.391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like, I just want to show you my pool cue.
- Okay.</font>

485
00:27:51.393 --> 00:27:52.892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And by "pool cue,"
I mean penis.</font>

486
00:27:52.894 --> 00:27:54.628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm referring to my penis.
Maybe we could have sex.</font>

487
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, see what happens.</font>

488
00:27:59.334 --> 00:28:01.470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare, Ronnie?</font>

489
00:28:03.273 --> 00:28:05.273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, did Olivia
put you up to this?</font>

490
00:28:05.275 --> 00:28:08.542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth... or dare?</font>

491
00:28:08.544 --> 00:28:11.811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, creepy... and sexy.</font>

492
00:28:11.813 --> 00:28:13.880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do it. Dare.</font>

493
00:28:13.882 --> 00:28:17.017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on the table and
show everyone your pool cue.</font>

494
00:28:17.019 --> 00:28:19.989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it. Okay. All right.</font>

495
00:28:22.425 --> 00:28:25.493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, friends and neighbors!</font>

496
00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:27.028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This fine young lady here
has asked me</font>

497
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to play a little game
of Truth or Dare with her,</font>

498
00:28:28.698 --> 00:28:31.499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and like a real gentleman,
I chose dare!</font>

499
00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:33.533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go, Ronnie!
- Whoo!</font>

500
00:28:33.535 --> 00:28:35.669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, now I will
do you all the honor</font>

501
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:38.539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of showing you my business.</font>

502
00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:40.707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seen it before! Not impressed!</font>

503
00:28:40.709 --> 00:28:43.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

504
00:28:43.012 --> 00:28:45.745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who is that, Beth?
- No, but Beth said it was tiny, too.</font>

505
00:28:47.015 --> 00:28:49.015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, uh, Beth would
never say that!</font>

506
00:28:49.017 --> 00:28:50.951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you know what,
screw this, I'm not...</font>

507
00:28:50.953 --> 00:28:52.289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, man.
- Oh, my.</font>

508
00:29:04.367 --> 00:29:06.667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, careful! Dude.
Hey, watch the pool cue, man.</font>

509
00:29:06.669 --> 00:29:08.069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

510
00:29:08.071 --> 00:29:09.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Whoa.</font>

511
00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:20.080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody call 911!</font>

512
00:29:20.082 --> 00:29:23.117
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I swear to you,
people were talking to me.</i></font>

513
00:29:23.119 --> 00:29:24.952
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It looked like
a messed-up Snapchat filter.</i></font>

514
00:29:24.954 --> 00:29:26.419
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They were asking me</i></font>

515
00:29:26.421 --> 00:29:28.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"truth or dare"
over and over again,</font>

516
00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and... I-I panicked.</font>

517
00:29:31.427 --> 00:29:33.426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're saying
a mob of people</font>

518
00:29:33.428 --> 00:29:35.428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">chanting in unison
made you tell Lucas</font>

519
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Markie is
a cheating whore.</font>

520
00:29:37.065 --> 00:29:38.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I know it sounds insane.</font>

521
00:29:38.767 --> 00:29:40.967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just a little.
- But it happened.</font>

522
00:29:40.969 --> 00:29:42.703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something really weird</font>

523
00:29:42.705 --> 00:29:44.472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has been going on
ever since Mexico.</font>

524
00:29:44.474 --> 00:29:46.139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on.</font>

525
00:29:46.141 --> 00:29:49.409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, keeping a secret like that,
it's a huge burden.</font>

526
00:29:49.411 --> 00:29:50.677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of us would fault you</font>

527
00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:52.545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for trying
to get it off your chest.</font>

528
00:29:52.547 --> 00:29:54.814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean,
n-not maybe so publicly.</font>

529
00:29:54.816 --> 00:29:57.818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you would have done it
for your YouTube channel.</font>

530
00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I will stab you with this.
- Calm down, baby.</font>

531
00:30:02.158 --> 00:30:04.023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Basic Beth again.</font>

532
00:30:08.797 --> 00:30:10.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

533
00:30:13.436 --> 00:30:15.869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me,</font>

534
00:30:15.871 --> 00:30:17.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">friends and neighbors!</font>

535
00:30:17.573 --> 00:30:19.673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This fine young lady
right here has asked me</font>

536
00:30:19.675 --> 00:30:21.908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to play a game
of Truth or Dare with her,</font>

537
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and like a real gentleman, I chose dare.
- Go, Ronnie!</font>

538
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, now I will
do you all the honor</font>

539
00:30:27.582 --> 00:30:29.617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of showing you my business.</font>

540
00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:31.788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gross.
- Ugh.</font>

541
00:30:37.493 --> 00:30:39.493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call 911!</font>

542
00:30:39.495 --> 00:30:42.061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad break.</font>

543
00:30:42.063 --> 00:30:44.834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's a pool joke.
- That's not funny.</font>

544
00:30:46.768 --> 00:30:49.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's the game.
- What?</font>

545
00:30:49.805 --> 00:30:52.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It is. It followed us home.
- Are-are you being serious?</font>

546
00:30:52.007 --> 00:30:54.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carter told me
that it was real,</font>

547
00:30:54.043 --> 00:30:55.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we were all in,
and that it would find us.</font>

548
00:30:55.812 --> 00:30:57.144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're really taking the word</font>

549
00:30:57.146 --> 00:30:58.978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of our mentally unstable
tour guide?</font>

550
00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How else do you explain what
happened to me in the library?</font>

551
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:03.451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Huh? And now Ronnie?
- Oh, I don't know.</font>

552
00:31:03.453 --> 00:31:05.119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he was drunk
and he fell off a pool table,</font>

553
00:31:05.121 --> 00:31:06.821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- which is what happened.
- So, it's just a coincidence that</font>

554
00:31:06.823 --> 00:31:08.888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- he was supposed to be doing a dare?
- Let's just calm down.</font>

555
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- No. Carter said, "Tell the truth or you die.</font>

556
00:31:11.494 --> 00:31:14.028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do the dare or you die."
Ronnie chickened out.</font>

557
00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did not do his dare,
and now he's dead!</font>

558
00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:19.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, tell me I'm not crazy!</font>

559
00:31:19.502 --> 00:31:21.869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no,
you definitely sound crazy.</font>

560
00:31:21.871 --> 00:31:23.704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucas.</font>

561
00:31:23.706 --> 00:31:25.705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry</font>

562
00:31:25.707 --> 00:31:27.675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for what I said,
but I swear to you,</font>

563
00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:29.676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something forced me
to say that.</font>

564
00:31:29.678 --> 00:31:32.480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I need you to believe me.</font>

565
00:31:32.482 --> 00:31:34.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

566
00:31:34.684 --> 00:31:36.716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of hard
to believe someone</font>

567
00:31:36.718 --> 00:31:38.822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who's been lying to you
for so long.</font>

568
00:31:44.927 --> 00:31:46.862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you, guys.</font>

569
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway,
now I will do you all the honor</font>

570
00:31:53.602 --> 00:31:55.538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of showing you my business.</font>

571
00:32:02.711 --> 00:32:04.712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucas.</font>

572
00:32:24.166 --> 00:32:26.636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucas.</font>

573
00:32:56.332 --> 00:32:58.898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucas.</font>

574
00:33:04.206 --> 00:33:06.510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's very funny, guys.</font>

575
00:33:11.746 --> 00:33:14.048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, this is insane.</font>

576
00:33:39.207 --> 00:33:41.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

577
00:33:42.143 --> 00:33:44.078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe you.</font>

578
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something started burning
"truth or dare" into my arm.</font>

579
00:33:47.115 --> 00:33:49.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Y-Yeah.</font>

580
00:33:49.685 --> 00:33:51.985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I mean...
it's gone now.</font>

581
00:33:51.987 --> 00:33:54.388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But... I felt it.</font>

582
00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Olivia, it was really painful.</font>

583
00:33:56.926 --> 00:33:58.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and when I was
in the library,</font>

584
00:33:58.893 --> 00:34:02.061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was surrounded by people, but
what we're seeing is not real.</font>

585
00:34:02.063 --> 00:34:03.999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only the consequences are.</font>

586
00:34:06.067 --> 00:34:08.102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you answer?</font>

587
00:34:08.104 --> 00:34:11.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucas, you have to answer.</font>

588
00:34:13.709 --> 00:34:16.746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had feelings for Olivia
since we met.</font>

589
00:34:22.218 --> 00:34:24.385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes I wonder
what it would be like</font>

590
00:34:24.387 --> 00:34:28.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be with her
instead of Markie.</font>

591
00:34:28.323 --> 00:34:32.026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I wonder what it would be
like to wake up next to her...</font>

592
00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:35.028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and kiss her.</font>

593
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I know
that can never happen.</font>

594
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, please tell me
you didn't hang up.</font>

595
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to convince
everybody else.</font>

596
00:34:47.075 --> 00:34:49.012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming.</font>

597
00:34:56.184 --> 00:34:58.952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is all this?</font>

598
00:34:58.954 --> 00:35:01.320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An intervention?</font>

599
00:35:01.322 --> 00:35:03.423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always thought day-drinking
Penelope would be first.</font>

600
00:35:03.425 --> 00:35:04.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

601
00:35:04.727 --> 00:35:06.160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for coming.</font>

602
00:35:06.162 --> 00:35:09.095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I live here.</font>

603
00:35:09.097 --> 00:35:11.698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what is it all about?</font>

604
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The game.</font>

605
00:35:13.436 --> 00:35:16.135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're still playing it in the
same order we played in Mexico.</font>

606
00:35:16.137 --> 00:35:18.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carter told us the truth;
the game is real.</font>

607
00:35:18.206 --> 00:35:20.874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, it was my turn,
I got asked in the library, and</font>

608
00:35:20.876 --> 00:35:22.742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it made me tell your secret;
then it was Ronnie's turn,</font>

609
00:35:22.744 --> 00:35:24.144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he didn't do his dare,
and it killed him.</font>

610
00:35:24.146 --> 00:35:25.912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you and Ronnie
shouldn't have answered.</font>

611
00:35:25.914 --> 00:35:28.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carter also said,
"Refuse to play and you die."</font>

612
00:35:28.284 --> 00:35:30.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got asked tonight,
and I tried to ignore it.</font>

613
00:35:32.921 --> 00:35:34.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then something burned
"truth or dare" on my arm.</font>

614
00:35:34.923 --> 00:35:38.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me.</font>

615
00:35:38.093 --> 00:35:39.959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's gone now, but...</font>

616
00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:43.030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Th-There's nothing there.
- Because I told the truth.</font>

617
00:35:43.032 --> 00:35:46.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God. Geez.
- Wow. Olivia.</font>

618
00:35:46.302 --> 00:35:48.102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, this is next-level.</font>

619
00:35:48.104 --> 00:35:50.937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't take responsibility
for humiliating me</font>

620
00:35:50.939 --> 00:35:53.106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in front of everyone
and ruining my relationship,</font>

621
00:35:53.108 --> 00:35:55.142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you come up
with some insane story</font>

622
00:35:55.144 --> 00:35:57.111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that a game made you say it?</font>

623
00:35:57.113 --> 00:35:59.946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you get Lucas
to lie for you.</font>

624
00:35:59.948 --> 00:36:01.749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I'm done.
- Markie.</font>

625
00:36:01.751 --> 00:36:03.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie. Stop.</font>

626
00:36:04.419 --> 00:36:07.053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can't be alone.
- Why not?</font>

627
00:36:07.055 --> 00:36:09.289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because in the picture,
your turn is next.</font>

628
00:36:14.963 --> 00:36:16.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unknown number.
Of course it is.</font>

629
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Truth or Dare?" Wow, a text. Really?
- Huh.</font>

630
00:36:21.803 --> 00:36:23.070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, there's no way a human</font>

631
00:36:23.072 --> 00:36:25.104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- could have sent...
- Just answer it.</font>

632
00:36:25.106 --> 00:36:26.974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

633
00:36:26.976 --> 00:36:28.975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dare.</font>

634
00:36:28.977 --> 00:36:31.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Dare you to follow through
with your promise.</font>

635
00:36:31.447 --> 00:36:33.546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Break Olivia's hand."</font>

636
00:36:33.548 --> 00:36:35.314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously, this was you.</font>

637
00:36:35.316 --> 00:36:37.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you see me
texting you right now?</font>

638
00:36:37.452 --> 00:36:40.320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but you were the only one
there when I said that.</font>

639
00:36:40.322 --> 00:36:43.457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, why would I dare you
to break my own hand?</font>

640
00:36:43.459 --> 00:36:45.392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know!
Okay, maybe you're making</font>

641
00:36:45.394 --> 00:36:47.059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a new YouTube video
on how to lose friends.</font>

642
00:36:47.061 --> 00:36:48.301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that seems
even less likely.</font>

643
00:36:49.999 --> 00:36:52.265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- You have to do it.</font>

644
00:36:52.267 --> 00:36:54.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

645
00:36:54.003 --> 00:36:56.238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to.</font>

646
00:36:58.173 --> 00:37:01.240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ronnie didn't do his dare,
and now he's dead.</font>

647
00:37:01.242 --> 00:37:03.943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Liv, this is so messed up.
- Even by my standards.</font>

648
00:37:03.945 --> 00:37:06.345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, as pissed as I am
at you right now...</font>

649
00:37:06.347 --> 00:37:09.416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm so pissed... there's no
way I'm gonna break your hand.</font>

650
00:37:09.418 --> 00:37:11.318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you don't really
have a choice.</font>

651
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So just take it. Please.</font>

652
00:37:14.023 --> 00:37:17.227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, I don't want to find
out what happens if you don't.</font>

653
00:37:19.093 --> 00:37:21.063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just do it.</font>

654
00:37:29.939 --> 00:37:32.372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I-I can't.
- God, just trust me, Markie!</font>

655
00:37:32.374 --> 00:37:34.343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it. Please.</font>

656
00:37:38.347 --> 00:37:40.883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, don't tell me you're
a fucking coward like your dad.</font>

657
00:37:44.887 --> 00:37:46.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, oh, my God.</font>

658
00:37:46.488 --> 00:37:48.055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get some ice.</font>

659
00:37:48.057 --> 00:37:49.923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't deal
with this crazy right now.</font>

660
00:37:49.925 --> 00:37:51.358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a med school
interview tomorrow.</font>

661
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, see a doctor.</font>

662
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:55.062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Guys!</font>

663
00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:58.265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we got to go
to the hospital, okay? Come on.</font>

664
00:38:02.938 --> 00:38:05.474
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You believe all this?</i></font>

665
00:38:07.443 --> 00:38:10.644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what to believe.</font>

666
00:38:40.075 --> 00:38:42.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

667
00:39:27.956 --> 00:39:29.224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brad.</font>

668
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

669
00:39:40.302 --> 00:39:41.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brad.</font>

670
00:39:41.302 --> 00:39:43.639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth!</font>

671
00:39:56.218 --> 00:39:58.017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brad?</font>

672
00:39:58.019 --> 00:40:00.053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

673
00:40:00.055 --> 00:40:02.388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing here?
- Uh, my job.</font>

674
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:04.390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you here?</font>

675
00:40:04.392 --> 00:40:06.492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friend of mine got hurt.
It's nothing serious.</font>

676
00:40:06.494 --> 00:40:09.398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just here for...
for moral support.</font>

677
00:40:12.133 --> 00:40:14.667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something wrong?</font>

678
00:40:14.669 --> 00:40:19.338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no, I'm just, uh...
I'm just a little shaken up.</font>

679
00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You haven't come by to see
your mother in a few weeks.</font>

680
00:40:22.043 --> 00:40:23.343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.</font>

681
00:40:23.345 --> 00:40:25.144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I was paying
for this school</font>

682
00:40:25.146 --> 00:40:27.146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you could come home
every once in a while.</font>

683
00:40:27.148 --> 00:40:29.115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I-I know, I know, I just...</font>

684
00:40:29.117 --> 00:40:31.385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things have been
a little crazy lately.</font>

685
00:40:31.387 --> 00:40:34.222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I don't want
to hear excuses, son.</font>

686
00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want the truth.</font>

687
00:40:40.628 --> 00:40:43.629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There goes another thousand
dollars in credit card debt.</font>

688
00:40:43.631 --> 00:40:45.499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, Liv.</font>

689
00:40:45.501 --> 00:40:47.501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just had my turn.</font>

690
00:40:47.503 --> 00:40:49.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You what?
- The game.</font>

691
00:40:49.371 --> 00:40:52.439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It made me, um,
it made me come out.</font>

692
00:40:52.441 --> 00:40:55.642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To my father.</font>

693
00:40:55.644 --> 00:40:57.981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wha... Are you okay?</font>

694
00:40:59.414 --> 00:41:01.113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

695
00:41:01.115 --> 00:41:02.783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

696
00:41:02.785 --> 00:41:06.153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the first time in my life,
I... I told him my truth</font>

697
00:41:06.155 --> 00:41:08.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I stood up to him,
and I feel...</font>

698
00:41:08.689 --> 00:41:10.689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel awesome.</font>

699
00:41:10.691 --> 00:41:14.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, hold on, your dad
didn't know that you were gay?</font>

700
00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:16.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your ringtone's Beyonce.</font>

701
00:41:16.564 --> 00:41:18.298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone loves Beyonce.</font>

702
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tyson's next.</font>

703
00:41:36.418 --> 00:41:38.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will do.</font>

704
00:41:38.653 --> 00:41:40.653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tyson Curran?</font>

705
00:41:40.655 --> 00:41:43.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do this.</font>

706
00:41:47.095 --> 00:41:49.032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right this way.</font>

707
00:41:53.267 --> 00:41:56.236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you come from
a family of doctors, then?</font>

708
00:41:56.238 --> 00:41:59.673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am. Mother, father,
sister, uncle and grandfather.</font>

709
00:41:59.675 --> 00:42:01.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty much everybody.</font>

710
00:42:01.209 --> 00:42:02.709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they must have
set a great example</font>

711
00:42:02.711 --> 00:42:04.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for you to want
to take the same route.</font>

712
00:42:04.613 --> 00:42:06.178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, uh, absolutely,
Dean Spencer.</font>

713
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, uh, growing up,</font>

714
00:42:08.182 --> 00:42:10.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would hear their stories
about saving lives,</font>

715
00:42:10.651 --> 00:42:12.818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and... I think...</font>

716
00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that somehow
shaped me.</font>

717
00:42:19.394 --> 00:42:21.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pen. Where's Tyson?</font>

718
00:42:21.329 --> 00:42:23.698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His med school interview. Why?</font>

719
00:42:26.635 --> 00:42:29.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know...</font>

720
00:42:29.204 --> 00:42:31.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could do something...</font>

721
00:42:31.606 --> 00:42:34.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">self-serving, like become
a hedge fund manager.</font>

722
00:42:34.409 --> 00:42:38.410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thing is, people need help,
especially in times like these.</font>

723
00:42:38.412 --> 00:42:40.213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's very noble of you.</font>

724
00:42:40.215 --> 00:42:43.216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know...</font>

725
00:42:43.218 --> 00:42:45.621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just have one final question.</font>

726
00:42:58.467 --> 00:43:01.167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He hasn't had his turn yet.</font>

727
00:43:01.169 --> 00:43:02.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Curran?</font>

728
00:43:02.604 --> 00:43:04.372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your bag.</font>

729
00:43:08.376 --> 00:43:10.609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait, Tyson, no. Wait, Tyson!
- Hey!</font>

730
00:43:10.611 --> 00:43:11.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I help you?</font>

731
00:43:19.188 --> 00:43:20.854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

732
00:43:20.856 --> 00:43:23.657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I beg your pardon?</font>

733
00:43:23.659 --> 00:43:25.959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

734
00:43:25.961 --> 00:43:28.461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth, I guess.</font>

735
00:43:28.463 --> 00:43:31.430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did my friends
really put you up to this?</font>

736
00:43:31.432 --> 00:43:33.332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long have you been
forging prescriptions?</font>

737
00:43:33.334 --> 00:43:36.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't.</font>

738
00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did she actually tell you that?</font>

739
00:43:40.642 --> 00:43:42.742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me?
- I don't forge prescriptions.</font>

740
00:43:42.744 --> 00:43:44.914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would you even ask me that?</font>

741
00:43:47.282 --> 00:43:49.216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

742
00:43:49.218 --> 00:43:51.550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ty! Ty! Ty! Open the door!
- Hey! Hey! Hey, Tyson!</font>

743
00:43:54.856 --> 00:43:56.590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tyson! Tyson!
- Are you okay?</font>

744
00:43:56.592 --> 00:43:58.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Open the door!
- Ty! Ty! Hey!</font>

745
00:43:58.293 --> 00:43:59.459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

746
00:43:59.461 --> 00:44:02.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Oh, my... Oh, my God!</font>

747
00:44:02.564 --> 00:44:04.898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

748
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God!</font>

749
00:44:16.244 --> 00:44:18.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tyson lied
and then died because of it.</font>

750
00:44:18.847 --> 00:44:22.414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like Ronnie did
when he didn't do the dare.</font>

751
00:44:22.416 --> 00:44:24.416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then my turn's next.</font>

752
00:44:24.418 --> 00:44:26.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, pick truth.</font>

753
00:44:26.622 --> 00:44:29.021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, listen,
we-we all should, right?</font>

754
00:44:29.023 --> 00:44:30.657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then whatever question
that we get asked,</font>

755
00:44:30.659 --> 00:44:32.258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we just answer it
with a hundred percent honesty.</font>

756
00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? That's how
we're gonna survive</font>

757
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:35.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">till we figure this out.</font>

758
00:44:37.532 --> 00:44:41.236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got it?
Only choose truth.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Need more vodka.</i></font>

760
00:44:44.338 --> 00:44:46.773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need sleep.</font>

761
00:44:46.775 --> 00:44:49.608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'll put her in bed.</font>

762
00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:51.410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys find Carter.</font>

763
00:44:51.412 --> 00:44:54.382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He started all this.
Maybe he can end it.</font>

764
00:45:02.724 --> 00:45:04.293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said that he went to USC.</font>

765
00:45:06.861 --> 00:45:09.629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 Carters,
none of them our guy.</font>

766
00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:11.898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he meant the other USC.</font>

767
00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, she's asleep.
Did you find Carter yet?</font>

768
00:45:14.436 --> 00:45:17.439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. Dead end.
- Did you try using Google?</font>

769
00:45:18.874 --> 00:45:21.444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Search "Mexico truth or dare."</font>

still an ongoing search.</font>

in any other photos.</font>

789
00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:05.879

Maybe he posted.</font>

790
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:07.146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not that I see.</font>

791
00:47:07.148 --> 00:47:09.015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But... there's a bunch of posts</font>

00:47:12.653 --> 00:47:14.653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, do you think
she's checking this?</font>

795
00:47:14.655 --> 00:47:17.189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- DM her.
- Wait.</font>

that time you came and visited</font>

801
00:47:33.675 --> 00:47:35.742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">me and my family in Texas,</font>

802

come out of hiding for</font>

811
00:48:07.943 --> 00:48:10.912

to set that woman on fire.</font>

812
00:48:12.213 --> 00:48:14.713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me where to meet you,</font>

813
00:48:14.715 --> 00:48:16.950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I'll wait outside
your family's house</font>

814
00:48:16.952 --> 00:48:19.952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until the game dares me
to do the same to them.</font>

815
00:48:19.954 --> 00:48:21.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, you cannot send that.</font>

816
00:48:21.622 --> 00:48:24.224

you need to stop thinking</font>

817
00:48:24.226 --> 00:48:27.463

thinking about yourself.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Hard to make a decision</font>

820
00:48:58.526 --> 00:49:00.792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without Tyson telling you
what to do?</font>

821
00:49:00.794 --> 00:49:03.863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Screw you.</font>

822
00:49:03.865 --> 00:49:05.265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth.</font>

823
00:49:05.267 --> 00:49:07.133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

824
00:49:07.135 --> 00:49:09.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said truth.</font>

825
00:49:09.003 --> 00:49:10.870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

826
00:49:10.872 --> 00:49:13.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not how this game works.</font>

827
00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:16.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell
is that supposed to mean?</font>

828
00:49:20.314 --> 00:49:22.548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be patient. She'll write back.</font>

829
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is all my fault.</font>

830
00:49:26.086 --> 00:49:28.023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, no, it's not.
- No, she's right.</font>

831
00:49:30.124 --> 00:49:32.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of us wanted
to follow that creep.</font>

832
00:49:32.927 --> 00:49:35.193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of us wanted to play
that stupid game.</font>

833
00:49:35.195 --> 00:49:38.664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only reason I went
on that trip was for you.</font>

834
00:49:38.666 --> 00:49:40.233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember?
You said you needed</font>

835
00:49:40.235 --> 00:49:41.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- your best friend.
- All right, come on...</font>

836
00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:43.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but now I realize
it's not about friendship</font>

837
00:49:43.805 --> 00:49:46.071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or "I choose you,"
it was about me being there</font>

838
00:49:46.073 --> 00:49:48.073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to cover your ass while
you hooked up with randoms!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

840
00:49:52.881 --> 00:49:54.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Screw you, Olivia.</font>

841
00:49:57.285 --> 00:49:59.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that necessary?</font>

842
00:49:59.653 --> 00:50:01.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys. Come outside.</font>

843
00:50:01.689 --> 00:50:03.222

844
00:50:03.224 --> 00:50:05.193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

845
00:50:07.796 --> 00:50:09.796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pen? What are you doing?</font>

846
00:50:09.798 --> 00:50:12.231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried.
It wouldn't let me pick truth.</font>

847
00:50:12.233 --> 00:50:14.133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried, I swear!</font>

848
00:50:16.171 --> 00:50:19.638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to walk the edge
until I finish this.</font>

849
00:50:20.909 --> 00:50:22.744

850
00:50:25.814 --> 00:50:28.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, just go slow.
Take your time.</font>

851
00:50:28.883 --> 00:50:31.850

852
00:50:31.852 --> 00:50:33.186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll try and grab her
if she loses her balance.</font>

00:50:33.188 --> 00:50:35.954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, your hand's broken.
I'll go.</font>

00:50:46.066 --> 00:50:48.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna be okay.</font>

861
00:50:48.802 --> 00:50:50.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to grab something
in case she falls. Go inside.</font>

862
00:50:50.972 --> 00:50:52.704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna clear a path.
- All right, let's go, let's go,</font>

863
00:50:52.706 --> 00:50:54.707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let's go, let's go!</font>

864
00:51:03.718 --> 00:51:07.186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pen? Be careful.</font>

865
00:51:07.188 --> 00:51:09.856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're good, okay?
- Hey, will this work?</font>

866
00:51:09.858 --> 00:51:12.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Yeah. Yeah. Come on.</font>

867
00:51:12.327 --> 00:51:15.061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get under her.</font>

868
00:51:15.063 --> 00:51:17.229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get under her and follow her.
- Be careful, Pen.</font>

869
00:51:17.231 --> 00:51:19.899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, sh...
- Get back. Get back, get back.</font>

870
00:51:19.901 --> 00:51:21.834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No need to rush.</font>

871
00:51:23.171 --> 00:51:25.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay, Pen.</font>

872
00:51:25.773 --> 00:51:27.942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just take your time.
Take it slowly.</font>

873
00:51:30.144 --> 00:51:33.014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pen, just put one foot
in front of the other.</font>

874
00:51:39.854 --> 00:51:41.887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch it, okay? Just go slow.</font>

875
00:51:41.889 --> 00:51:43.756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do this.</font>

876
00:51:43.758 --> 00:51:46.095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're right here.
We're here for you, okay?</font>

877
00:51:51.865 --> 00:51:53.966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see her. She's right there.</font>

878
00:51:53.968 --> 00:51:55.371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Go. Go.</font>

879
00:51:57.439 --> 00:52:00.472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- W-Wait, she's on the corner.
- There she is.</font>

880
00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:04.109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that stuff out of the way.</font>

881
00:52:11.218 --> 00:52:14.120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pen! Pen.</font>

882
00:52:14.122 --> 00:52:16.455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming. I'm coming.</font>

883
00:52:17.925 --> 00:52:19.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no,
don't get too close.</font>

884
00:52:19.927 --> 00:52:22.195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I, if I, if I cheat,
if I don't do the dare...</font>

885
00:52:22.197 --> 00:52:24.731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I know. Okay?</font>

886
00:52:24.733 --> 00:52:27.999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when you finish,
I'll be here to grab you.</font>

887
00:52:28.001 --> 00:52:29.871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just got to go around
this corner now, okay?</font>

888
00:52:40.215 --> 00:52:41.981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

889
00:52:44.017 --> 00:52:45.954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

890
00:52:47.488 --> 00:52:50.990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take your time, okay?</font>

891
00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're doing great, Pen.</font>

892
00:52:55.796 --> 00:52:58.030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't look down.
- Wait. Stay here. Stay below her.</font>

893
00:52:58.032 --> 00:53:00.332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
Wait, where are you going?</font>

894
00:53:00.334 --> 00:53:02.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Pen.
Don't look at the fence.</font>

895
00:53:02.369 --> 00:53:04.870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? Look at me.
Okay? You're almost there.</font>

896
00:53:04.872 --> 00:53:06.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a little more.</font>

897
00:53:18.452 --> 00:53:20.952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's right above us.
Throw it on top.</font>

898
00:53:20.954 --> 00:53:22.034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You ready?
- Yeah.</font>

899
00:53:25.126 --> 00:53:27.292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not gonna work.</font>

900
00:53:31.231 --> 00:53:33.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That might.</font>

901
00:53:39.807 --> 00:53:41.240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whoa!
- Hey! Penelope!</font>

902
00:53:41.242 --> 00:53:43.479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

903
00:53:47.148 --> 00:53:49.015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, get back further!</font>

904
00:53:49.017 --> 00:53:50.582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go, go, go, move back.
- Get back!</font>

905
00:53:50.584 --> 00:53:52.385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One last sip.</font>

906
00:54:05.532 --> 00:54:08.102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, Pen! Hey, Pen! No! No!</font>

907
00:54:10.604 --> 00:54:13.439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pen?
- She's not moving.</font>

908
00:54:13.441 --> 00:54:14.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pen?</font>

909
00:54:22.916 --> 00:54:25.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this my bed?</font>

910
00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:31.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

911
00:54:31.492 --> 00:54:34.062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're okay.</font>

912
00:54:37.164 --> 00:54:40.434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just got a Facebook message
from Giselle.</font>

913
00:54:55.249 --> 00:54:58.550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're sure this is a good idea,
meeting her here?</font>

914
00:54:58.552 --> 00:54:59.952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if the cops
trace her message?</font>

915
00:54:59.954 --> 00:55:01.354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, she wrote us
on a fake account.</font>

916
00:55:01.356 --> 00:55:03.356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but that chick
lit somebody on fire.</font>

917
00:55:03.358 --> 00:55:05.224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She's probably nuts.
- I mean,</font>

918
00:55:05.226 --> 00:55:07.106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do we really have another choice?</font>

919
00:55:14.568 --> 00:55:16.936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, we can talk
about this inside. Come on.</font>

920
00:55:18.506 --> 00:55:20.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

921
00:55:22.543 --> 00:55:24.609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Inside?</font>

922
00:55:24.611 --> 00:55:26.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-uh. Okay, all right,
that's far enough.</font>

923
00:55:26.648 --> 00:55:28.280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you tell us
what's happening?</font>

924
00:55:28.282 --> 00:55:30.548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Which one of you is Olivia?
- No, you answer</font>

925
00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:32.218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our question first:
How do you know Carter?</font>

926
00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Carter?
- You know, cut the crap.</font>

927
00:55:33.553 --> 00:55:34.519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We saw the photo.</font>

928
00:55:34.521 --> 00:55:37.055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the one who brought us
into this game.</font>

929
00:55:37.057 --> 00:55:38.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, yeah, right, okay.</font>

930
00:55:38.126 --> 00:55:40.559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Carter, right.
- Did he bring you into this, too?</font>

931
00:55:40.561 --> 00:55:42.428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N-No, uh, he didn't,
he didn't start this.</font>

932
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:43.662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was just one of my friends.</font>

933
00:55:43.664 --> 00:55:47.133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We-we all went on a trip to
Mexico and got really wasted.</font>

934
00:55:47.135 --> 00:55:50.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We-we found this old church,
and we decided to party in it,</font>

935
00:55:50.204 --> 00:55:52.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my roommate wanted to play
Truth or Dare, so we did,</font>

936
00:55:52.372 --> 00:55:54.606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but when we got home, the game,
it just, it kept going.</font>

937
00:55:54.608 --> 00:55:56.374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My roommate died first,
and then the other ones...</font>

938
00:55:56.376 --> 00:55:59.312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How is this possible?
- I wish I knew.</font>

939
00:55:59.314 --> 00:56:01.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I thought
this was some kind of, like,</font>

940
00:56:01.249 --> 00:56:03.215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">karmic payback for Sam
trashing the place, you know?</font>

941
00:56:03.217 --> 00:56:05.350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam?
- Uh, yeah, Sam.</font>

942
00:56:05.352 --> 00:56:07.218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He-he was...
one of my friends.</font>

943
00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He-he got really drunk, and
he just started breaking stuff.</font>

944
00:56:09.389 --> 00:56:12.024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, we were, we were
all being idiots.</font>

945
00:56:12.026 --> 00:56:14.093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our friend
just had a turn in the game.</font>

946
00:56:14.095 --> 00:56:16.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wouldn't let her pick truth.
Do you know why?</font>

947
00:56:16.564 --> 00:56:17.997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's how we played.</font>

948
00:56:17.999 --> 00:56:19.664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We called it
two truths and a dare.</font>

949
00:56:19.666 --> 00:56:21.666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If... if two people
picked truth in a row,</font>

950
00:56:21.668 --> 00:56:23.635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then the next person
had to do a dare.</font>

951
00:56:23.637 --> 00:56:25.671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought it was
more fun that way.</font>

952
00:56:25.673 --> 00:56:29.475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More fun? Your asshole buddy
gave us a death sentence.</font>

953
00:56:29.477 --> 00:56:31.276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any more super dangerous rules
you want to tell us about?</font>

954
00:56:31.278 --> 00:56:33.512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, Pen.</font>

955
00:56:33.514 --> 00:56:36.082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He-he told me he was dared
to find a new group to play,</font>

956
00:56:36.084 --> 00:56:37.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that it had to be
at the mission.</font>

957
00:56:37.684 --> 00:56:39.352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't have a choice,
you know?</font>

958
00:56:39.354 --> 00:56:41.187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course he did.</font>

959
00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:43.189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so where is Carter now?</font>

960
00:56:43.191 --> 00:56:45.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't talked to him
since he went back to Mexico.</font>

961
00:56:45.093 --> 00:56:48.059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought that when he got
a new group to play</font>

962
00:56:48.061 --> 00:56:50.095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we-we would be out.
I can't believe he only got</font>

963
00:56:50.097 --> 00:56:52.398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 of you to play.
If he would've got more,</font>

964
00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I would've had a longer
time before I had to go again.</font>

965
00:56:55.369 --> 00:56:57.635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got another turn?</font>

966
00:56:57.637 --> 00:56:59.671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, it's time to go, guys.</font>

967
00:56:59.673 --> 00:57:01.240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this why
you're telling us the truth?</font>

968
00:57:01.242 --> 00:57:04.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I, uh... I picked dare.</font>

969
00:57:04.445 --> 00:57:06.278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie's right.
Let's get out of here.</font>

970
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we're leaving.
Come on, Olivia.</font>

971
00:57:10.385 --> 00:57:13.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry, Olivia.</font>

972
00:57:13.086 --> 00:57:15.653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you know my name
when I got here?</font>

973
00:57:15.655 --> 00:57:18.226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I didn't put it
in the message.</font>

974
00:57:19.526 --> 00:57:21.026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

975
00:57:21.028 --> 00:57:23.396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No! Pen!
- Pen!</font>

976
00:57:23.398 --> 00:57:25.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

977
00:57:28.436 --> 00:57:30.535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hold her down!
- I have to kill Olivia!</font>

978
00:57:30.537 --> 00:57:32.504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold her down!</font>

979
00:57:32.506 --> 00:57:34.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab the gun.</font>

980
00:57:36.543 --> 00:57:39.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop moving.</font>

981
00:57:39.046 --> 00:57:40.715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...?</font>

982
00:57:42.383 --> 00:57:44.316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No! No!</font>

983
00:57:44.318 --> 00:57:47.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No! No!</font>

984
00:57:49.189 --> 00:57:50.659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

985
00:57:55.229 --> 00:57:58.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was she thinking?</font>

986
00:57:58.166 --> 00:58:00.399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't her.</font>

987
00:58:00.401 --> 00:58:02.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something took over,
like she was possessed.</font>

988
00:58:02.403 --> 00:58:04.303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't finish her dare.</font>

989
00:58:04.305 --> 00:58:06.472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Ronnie.</font>

990
00:58:06.474 --> 00:58:08.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what happens.</font>

991
00:58:08.742 --> 00:58:10.678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what do we do?</font>

992
00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We tell the truth.</font>

993
00:58:25.693 --> 00:58:27.358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, right away.
<i>- She was erratic,</i></font>

994
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.760
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>said she had to kill me.</i></font>

995
00:58:28.762 --> 00:58:30.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then Penelope
pushed me out of the way,</font>

996
00:58:30.764 --> 00:58:32.631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she shot her and then
turned the gun on herself.</font>

997
00:58:32.633 --> 00:58:34.834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were you aware that Giselle
Hammond was wanted for murder?</font>

998
00:58:34.836 --> 00:58:38.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Yeah, we thought
that she knew someone</font>

999
00:58:38.405 --> 00:58:40.673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we were looking for,
a guy that we met in Mexico.</font>

1000
00:58:40.675 --> 00:58:43.675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- His name was Carter.
- You don't know his last name?</font>

1001
00:58:43.677 --> 00:58:45.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1002
00:58:45.445 --> 00:58:49.183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any of these people
look like him?</font>

1003
00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:58.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Who are they?</font>

1004
00:58:58.526 --> 00:59:01.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 of Giselle Hammond's
friends... all deceased.</font>

1005
00:59:01.662 --> 00:59:05.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 suicides, 2 accidental
deaths, all in 3 weeks.</font>

1006
00:59:06.901 --> 00:59:09.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you've lost
two friends.</font>

1007
00:59:09.604 --> 00:59:12.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe
in coincidences, Olivia.</font>

1008
00:59:12.606 --> 00:59:14.273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this is all connected.</font>

1009
00:59:14.275 --> 00:59:16.341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you know how,
you need to tell me.</font>

1010
00:59:16.343 --> 00:59:18.510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I promise.</font>

1011
00:59:18.512 --> 00:59:21.146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I did know, I would.</font>

1012
00:59:21.148 --> 00:59:23.451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope so.</font>

1013
00:59:29.657 --> 00:59:31.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be in touch.</font>

1014
00:59:31.526 --> 00:59:34.629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't take any more vacations.</font>

1015
00:59:37.264 --> 00:59:39.198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That did not go well.</font>

1016
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We told them the truth.</font>

1017
00:59:40.867 --> 00:59:42.468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As much as we could.</font>

1018
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:44.303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, the cops should be
the least of our concerns.</font>

1019
00:59:44.305 --> 00:59:47.840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, Penelope's dead
and Giselle gave us nothing.</font>

1020
00:59:47.842 --> 00:59:50.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She did say a new game
had to start at the mission.</font>

1021
00:59:50.845 --> 00:59:52.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That place has to be the key.</font>

1022
00:59:52.847 --> 00:59:55.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brad.</font>

1023
00:59:55.782 --> 00:59:57.950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Catch up
with you guys later.</font>

1024
00:59:57.952 --> 00:59:59.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, we shouldn't split up.
- No, it's okay.</font>

1025
00:59:59.486 --> 01:00:00.753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My turn's not for a while.</font>

1026
01:00:00.755 --> 01:00:05.323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll deal with my father; you
deal with finding the mission.</font>

1027
01:00:05.325 --> 01:00:07.262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1028
01:00:11.465 --> 01:00:12.867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it was built in 1896.</font>

1029
01:00:14.367 --> 01:00:16.535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that really
narrows it down.</font>

1030
01:00:16.537 --> 01:00:18.736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a start.</font>

1031
01:00:18.738 --> 01:00:21.273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.
I got to grab my charger.</font>

1032
01:00:21.275 --> 01:00:23.211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I think you left
your bag in my room.</font>

1033
01:00:55.276 --> 01:00:56.508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God.
- What?</font>

1034
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:58.880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check this out.</font>

1035
01:01:01.514 --> 01:01:05.316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says there was a massacre
a few weeks later.</font>

1036
01:01:05.318 --> 01:01:09.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only one survivor, lives in
the area, Inez Reyes, 19.</font>

1037
01:01:49.997 --> 01:01:54.603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

1038
01:02:04.378 --> 01:02:07.945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is she? Liv!</font>

1039
01:02:07.947 --> 01:02:09.615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey! Hey!
- Olivia.</font>

1040
01:02:09.617 --> 01:02:11.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay?
- Where am I?</font>

1041
01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:13.551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where am I?!
- What the hell are you...?</font>

1042
01:02:13.553 --> 01:02:15.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the... Hey, hey, hey!</font>

1043
01:02:15.488 --> 01:02:16.854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1044
01:02:16.856 --> 01:02:18.856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

1045
01:02:18.858 --> 01:02:20.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that your turn?</font>

1046
01:02:20.727 --> 01:02:22.695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, come back!</font>

1047
01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:24.532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come back!</font>

1048
01:02:28.336 --> 01:02:31.669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Olivia, what did he say?</font>

1049
01:02:35.443 --> 01:02:38.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He dared me
to sleep with Lucas.</font>

1050
01:02:40.347 --> 01:02:42.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would you pick dare?</font>

1051
01:02:42.483 --> 01:02:44.483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of what Giselle said.</font>

1052
01:02:44.485 --> 01:02:45.983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I-If I picked truth,</font>

1053
01:02:45.985 --> 01:02:48.956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just forcing
someone else to pick dare.</font>

1054
01:02:52.492 --> 01:02:54.595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How noble.</font>

1055
01:02:56.597 --> 01:02:59.430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, I didn't know
that's what it would ask.</font>

1056
01:02:59.432 --> 01:03:01.999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
he knew where he was.</font>

1057
01:03:02.001 --> 01:03:03.836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, I'm perfect.</font>

1058
01:03:03.838 --> 01:03:05.537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, hey, hey.
Where are you going?</font>

1059
01:03:05.539 --> 01:03:07.872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Anywhere but here.
- What is going on?</font>

1060
01:03:07.874 --> 01:03:10.512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you ask Olivia?</font>

1061
01:03:16.383 --> 01:03:20.354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you please tell me
what the hell is going on?</font>

1062
01:03:25.992 --> 01:03:27.992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got my turn.</font>

1063
01:03:27.994 --> 01:03:29.697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and?</font>

1064
01:03:38.405 --> 01:03:41.409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm, oh, hey, no.
Wh-What are we doing?</font>

1065
01:03:45.445 --> 01:03:47.979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, this is the dare.</font>

1066
01:03:47.981 --> 01:03:49.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1067
01:03:49.883 --> 01:03:51.816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you pick truth?</font>

1068
01:03:51.818 --> 01:03:54.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told Markie it was so that
you guys wouldn't have to,</font>

1069
01:03:54.822 --> 01:03:56.988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that was a lie.</font>

1070
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:58.823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I chose dare because
there is something</font>

1071
01:03:58.825 --> 01:04:00.459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I can never tell Markie,</font>

1072
01:04:00.461 --> 01:04:02.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm really afraid
the game's gonna make me do it.</font>

1073
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:04.095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't be that bad.</font>

1074
01:04:06.633 --> 01:04:08.535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea.</font>

1075
01:04:20.814 --> 01:04:22.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1076
01:04:24.584 --> 01:04:26.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you are just doing this
because of the dare,</font>

1077
01:04:26.653 --> 01:04:27.952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you have to.</font>

1078
01:04:27.954 --> 01:04:30.856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you have to.</font>

1079
01:04:30.858 --> 01:04:32.526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't.</font>

1080
01:05:07.994 --> 01:05:09.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at me.</font>

1081
01:05:13.767 --> 01:05:15.102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

1082
01:05:17.238 --> 01:05:20.238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

1083
01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tr-Truth!</font>

1084
01:05:21.976 --> 01:05:24.242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you truly in love with?</font>

1085
01:05:30.651 --> 01:05:33.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I care about you. I do.</font>

1086
01:05:35.655 --> 01:05:38.092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in love with Markie.</font>

1087
01:05:42.095 --> 01:05:44.796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Liv, I'm sorry.
It was the game.</font>

1088
01:05:44.798 --> 01:05:47.901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it was the truth.</font>

1089
01:06:15.662 --> 01:06:17.963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roy Cameron, 45 years old,</font>

1090
01:06:17.965 --> 01:06:19.865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">attempts to make dinner.</font>

1091
01:06:19.867 --> 01:06:21.633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take one.</font>

1092
01:06:21.635 --> 01:06:23.734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, a little faith, please.</font>

1093
01:06:23.736 --> 01:06:25.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody makes a steak
like your old man.</font>

1094
01:06:25.805 --> 01:06:28.173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, Dad, I'm pescatarian now.</font>

1095
01:06:28.175 --> 01:06:30.979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, honey.</font>

1096
01:06:34.881 --> 01:06:36.582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

1097
01:06:36.584 --> 01:06:38.953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss you so much.</font>

1098
01:06:41.854 --> 01:06:43.854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss you, too.</font>

1099
01:06:43.856 --> 01:06:47.191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something that
I've been dying to ask you.</font>

1100
01:06:51.064 --> 01:06:53.966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1101
01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:56.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not answering.</font>

1102
01:06:56.369 --> 01:06:57.836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Come here.
Look at this.</font>

1103
01:06:57.838 --> 01:06:59.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no number,
but she lives in Tijuana.</font>

1104
01:06:59.773 --> 01:07:01.106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's less than
3 hours away.</font>

1105
01:07:01.108 --> 01:07:02.975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is she?</font>

1106
01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:04.977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's someone who might
be able to help us.</font>

1107
01:07:04.979 --> 01:07:06.648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1108
01:07:12.919 --> 01:07:16.187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, sweetheart.</font>

1109
01:07:16.189 --> 01:07:18.624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time to pick.</font>

1110
01:07:18.626 --> 01:07:21.158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth.</font>

1111
01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The gun I used
to kill myself...</font>

1112
01:07:24.764 --> 01:07:26.698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why do you keep it?</font>

1113
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:30.102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes I think about
using it.</font>

1114
01:07:30.104 --> 01:07:32.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you should get it.</font>

1115
01:07:39.278 --> 01:07:41.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm worried about Markie.</i></font>

1116
01:07:41.247 --> 01:07:44.015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish we would have
found her before we left.</font>

1117
01:07:44.017 --> 01:07:46.718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, she doesn't want
to speak to me right now,</font>

1118
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so there's nothing we can do.</font>

1119
01:07:51.691 --> 01:07:54.059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know that secret
that you're keeping from her?</font>

1120
01:07:54.061 --> 01:07:55.760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe if you got it out,</font>

1121
01:07:55.762 --> 01:07:57.896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- the game couldn't use it against you.
- No.</font>

1122
01:07:57.898 --> 01:07:59.798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one can ever know.</font>

1123
01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially not Markie.
It would kill her.</font>

1124
01:08:02.869 --> 01:08:06.104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll try her again
when we get there.</font>

1125
01:08:48.482 --> 01:08:50.414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Um...
- Can I help you?</font>

1126
01:08:50.416 --> 01:08:53.118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S-Sorry. Um, we're looking
for Inez Reyes.</font>

1127
01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's my grandmother.
I watch after her.</font>

1128
01:08:55.188 --> 01:08:57.355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were just wondering
if we could speak to her.</font>

1129
01:08:57.357 --> 01:08:59.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She speaks to no one.</font>

1130
01:08:59.727 --> 01:09:01.793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Please!</font>

1131
01:09:01.795 --> 01:09:03.794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our friends are dying
just like hers did.</font>

1132
01:09:03.796 --> 01:09:05.400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We-we just need a few words.</font>

1133
01:09:09.001 --> 01:09:11.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will ask.</font>

1134
01:09:11.004 --> 01:09:15.073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you could...
show her this.</font>

1135
01:09:15.075 --> 01:09:17.809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show her that we were
at this mission</font>

1136
01:09:17.811 --> 01:09:21.078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that half the people
in this photo are now dead.</font>

1137
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then maybe she'll talk to us.</font>

1138
01:09:24.951 --> 01:09:28.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She might see you,
but she will not speak to you.</font>

1139
01:09:28.488 --> 01:09:31.288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has not said a word
in 50 years.</font>

1140
01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:33.760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait here.</font>

1141
01:09:36.863 --> 01:09:40.398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She must have taken
a vow of silence, right?</font>

1142
01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was 19 when her friends
were butchered.</font>

1143
01:09:42.236 --> 01:09:45.439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Imagine what that did to her.
- I don't have to.</font>

1144
01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:08.061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been over an hour.</font>

1145
01:10:10.363 --> 01:10:12.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, for someone
who doesn't speak,</font>

1146
01:10:12.366 --> 01:10:15.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they seem to be doing
a lot of talking.</font>

1147
01:10:15.568 --> 01:10:17.871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She will see you.</font>

1148
01:10:20.941 --> 01:10:23.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry for the wait.</font>

1149
01:10:23.043 --> 01:10:25.476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has written
something for you.</font>

1150
01:10:25.478 --> 01:10:28.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1151
01:10:28.247 --> 01:10:31.048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She would not let me read it.</font>

1152
01:10:37.357 --> 01:10:40.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for seeing us,
Miss Reyes.</font>

1153
01:10:57.945 --> 01:10:59.877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The mission was a convent</font>

1154
01:10:59.879 --> 01:11:01.479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"where young women
went to find God.</font>

1155
01:11:01.481 --> 01:11:06.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"We were girls, so we played
silly games like Hide and Seek.</font>

1156
01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:08.052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"But the priest
who ran the convent</font>

1157
01:11:08.054 --> 01:11:10.187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"forced us to play
his own game.</font>

1158
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:13.024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"He let us hide, but then
he took the one he found.</font>

1159
01:11:13.026 --> 01:11:15.563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"His pleasure was our pain.</font>

1160
01:11:16.863 --> 01:11:19.029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"We suffered in silence.</font>

1161
01:11:19.031 --> 01:11:20.465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Then one of the girls
told a secret.</font>

1162
01:11:20.467 --> 01:11:23.435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"She knew spells
that could call spirits,</font>

1163
01:11:23.437 --> 01:11:26.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"so she summoned
a demon named Calux.</font>

1164
01:11:26.572 --> 01:11:28.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He possessed our game."</font>

1165
01:11:28.342 --> 01:11:29.911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Possessed the game?</font>

1166
01:11:41.921 --> 01:11:46.024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Demons possess people, places,</font>

1167
01:11:46.026 --> 01:11:48.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">objects, even ideas."</font>

1168
01:11:50.429 --> 01:11:51.997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, uh...</font>

1169
01:11:51.999 --> 01:11:53.431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Calux is a trickster.</font>

1170
01:11:53.433 --> 01:11:55.499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"That night, when the priest
found his victim,</font>

1171
01:11:55.501 --> 01:11:57.668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"she was possessed by Calux.</font>

1172
01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:00.404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"She hid the priest's body
in the mission...</font>

1173
01:12:00.406 --> 01:12:02.274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"in pieces.</font>

1174
01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:05.146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"It took them a week
to find his head.</font>

1175
01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"But Calux didn't want to stop.</font>

1176
01:12:10.317 --> 01:12:12.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"He made us keep playing.</font>

1177
01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:14.188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Many of my sisters died."</font>

1178
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, how did you
and the others escape?</font>

1179
01:12:32.939 --> 01:12:35.673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The person
who released the demon</font>

1180
01:12:35.675 --> 01:12:37.542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"can trap it
with a simple ritual,</font>

1181
01:12:37.544 --> 01:12:39.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but only by his own hand."</font>

1182
01:12:44.084 --> 01:12:47.418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, this is the spell?
Uh, it's in Spanish.</font>

1183
01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:50.187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The spell must be
repeated 7 times</font>

1184
01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:53.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and a sacrifice must be placed
in a pot sealed with wax.</font>

1185
01:13:00.968 --> 01:13:04.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"As long as the pot
stays sealed in the mission,</font>

1186
01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:09.142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the door we opened for Calux
will also be sealed."</font>

1187
01:13:11.244 --> 01:13:13.680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, I've seen
that pot before.</font>

1188
01:13:17.683 --> 01:13:19.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Look.</font>

1189
01:13:19.486 --> 01:13:21.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when I saw it,
it was broken</font>

1190
01:13:21.487 --> 01:13:24.254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and there was something inside
it and it smelled rotten.</font>

1191
01:13:46.713 --> 01:13:50.315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Whoever broke the pot
will have to do the same."</font>

1192
01:13:50.317 --> 01:13:52.550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was it?
The sacrifice.</font>

1193
01:14:04.097 --> 01:14:06.534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was you
who summoned the demon?</font>

1194
01:14:31.323 --> 01:14:34.258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been a few years
since AP Spanish,</font>

1195
01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:37.662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I think it says,
"I have called upon an evil.</font>

1196
01:14:37.664 --> 01:14:41.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silence my voice,
so the evil is no more."</font>

1197
01:14:41.768 --> 01:14:44.334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So when Carter and his friends
broke the pot at the mission...</font>

1198
01:14:44.336 --> 01:14:45.270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The demon was freed</font>

1199
01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:46.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and possessed their game
of Truth or Dare.</font>

1200
01:14:46.807 --> 01:14:48.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we have to find
whoever broke that pot.</font>

1201
01:14:48.808 --> 01:14:51.176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Giselle said somebody
named Sam trashed the place.</font>

1202
01:14:51.178 --> 01:14:53.444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we have no idea who Sam is.</font>

1203
01:14:53.446 --> 01:14:56.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Or if he's even still alive.
- And if we do find him...</font>

1204
01:14:56.683 --> 01:14:58.248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1205
01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:00.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hi, Sam. Do you mind
cutting out your tongue</font>

1206
01:15:00.487 --> 01:15:03.357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and sealing it in this
lovely handmade pot?"</font>

1207
01:15:05.092 --> 01:15:06.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll check
Giselle's Facebook again,</font>

1208
01:15:06.526 --> 01:15:08.262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">see if there's a Sam tagged.</font>

1209
01:15:09.495 --> 01:15:10.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still nothing from Markie?</font>

1210
01:15:10.763 --> 01:15:13.597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's ignoring all my texts.</font>

1211
01:15:13.599 --> 01:15:14.865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her turn's next.</font>

1212
01:15:14.867 --> 01:15:16.568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna try
calling her again.</font>

1213
01:15:18.772 --> 01:15:21.338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brad? Brad!</font>

1214
01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:23.208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your father.</font>

1215
01:15:23.210 --> 01:15:26.578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since Penelope, he's been...</font>

1216
01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get rid of him.</font>

1217
01:15:35.121 --> 01:15:37.057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's talk outside.</font>

1218
01:15:46.398 --> 01:15:47.899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna grab coffee.</font>

1219
01:15:49.268 --> 01:15:51.302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, uh, I'm hearing
some things</font>

1220
01:15:51.304 --> 01:15:53.303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about your, uh,
friend's murder.</font>

1221
01:15:53.305 --> 01:15:56.474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kranis in Homicide isn't
convinced it's so simple.</font>

1222
01:15:56.476 --> 01:16:00.444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I don't need
to ask this, but...</font>

1223
01:16:00.446 --> 01:16:02.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is there something
you're not telling us?</font>

1224
01:16:02.448 --> 01:16:03.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I-I promise.</font>

1225
01:16:03.849 --> 01:16:05.617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything we told you
was true.</font>

1226
01:16:08.921 --> 01:16:11.655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, thank God.</font>

1227
01:16:11.657 --> 01:16:13.190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you telling me
all this?</font>

1228
01:16:13.192 --> 01:16:14.592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I know Kranis is wrong,</font>

1229
01:16:14.594 --> 01:16:16.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I want you to know
what's going on.</font>

1230
01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:17.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you don't have to worry.</font>

1231
01:16:17.763 --> 01:16:20.333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.</font>

1232
01:16:21.601 --> 01:16:23.704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're still my son, Brad.</font>

1233
01:16:30.576 --> 01:16:33.677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You gonna get that?
- Get what?</font>

1234
01:16:33.679 --> 01:16:37.181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare, Brad?</font>

1235
01:16:37.183 --> 01:16:38.917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I guess
I just needed some time alone.</font>

1236
01:16:38.919 --> 01:16:40.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.
It's-it's fine.</font>

1237
01:16:40.253 --> 01:16:41.653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get here
as fast as you can.</font>

1238
01:16:41.655 --> 01:16:43.654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And please be careful.
Your turn's next.</font>

1239
01:16:43.656 --> 01:16:46.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had my turn.
I chose truth.</font>

1240
01:16:46.526 --> 01:16:48.592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So did Lucas.</font>

1241
01:16:48.594 --> 01:16:51.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if the both of you
picked truth...</font>

1242
01:16:51.564 --> 01:16:53.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You only have one choice.</font>

1243
01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:55.233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure there's nothing
you need to tell me?</font>

1244
01:16:55.235 --> 01:16:57.935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I dare you to steal his gun</font>

1245
01:16:57.937 --> 01:17:00.939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and make him beg for his life.</font>

1246
01:17:00.941 --> 01:17:02.574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son?</font>

1247
01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:06.910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Dad, for everything.</font>

1248
01:17:06.912 --> 01:17:10.547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just, uh, there's just
one more thing I need to do,</font>

1249
01:17:10.549 --> 01:17:12.417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I hope you can forgive me.</font>

1250
01:17:12.419 --> 01:17:15.419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Of course.</font>

1251
01:17:15.421 --> 01:17:16.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what?</font>

1252
01:17:22.995 --> 01:17:25.265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1253
01:17:28.268 --> 01:17:30.668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to beg.
For your life.</font>

1254
01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:32.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The hell are you doing?
- Beg for your life!</font>

1255
01:17:32.805 --> 01:17:34.972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brad, please, put the gun down!</font>

1256
01:17:34.974 --> 01:17:36.975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just do as I say or I'll die.
- You don't have to do this!</font>

1257
01:17:36.977 --> 01:17:39.543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get on your knees.
- We have to go. Now!</font>

1258
01:17:39.545 --> 01:17:41.412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do as I say.
I'll explain everything, okay?</font>

1259
01:17:41.414 --> 01:17:42.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know I've been hard on you.
- Listen. No!</font>

1260
01:17:42.648 --> 01:17:43.648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And I'm sorry.
- No.</font>

1261
01:17:43.650 --> 01:17:44.850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not what this is about.</font>

1262
01:17:50.557 --> 01:17:52.657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beg! Please.
I'll explain everything.</font>

1263
01:17:52.659 --> 01:17:54.425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just beg.
- I guess you think I deserve this.</font>

1264
01:17:54.427 --> 01:17:55.959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No.</font>

1265
01:17:55.961 --> 01:17:57.630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just, just, just, just beg!</font>

1266
01:18:02.302 --> 01:18:04.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please! Just beg
and I'll put down the gun.</font>

1267
01:18:04.403 --> 01:18:05.837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's that gonna prove, Brad?
- Just beg,</font>

1268
01:18:05.839 --> 01:18:08.309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll put down the gun! Beg!</font>

1269
01:18:11.577 --> 01:18:13.343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no!</font>

1270
01:18:13.345 --> 01:18:15.712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No! No!
- Brad!</font>

1271
01:18:15.714 --> 01:18:17.815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brad! No, no, no! No!</font>

1272
01:18:17.817 --> 01:18:18.983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

1273
01:18:18.985 --> 01:18:20.787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get a paramedic!</font>

1274
01:18:21.787 --> 01:18:23.587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1275
01:18:23.589 --> 01:18:24.955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brad, Brad! No, no, no.</font>

1276
01:18:24.957 --> 01:18:26.757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay here.
You're gonna be fine.</font>

1277
01:18:26.759 --> 01:18:28.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

1278
01:18:28.862 --> 01:18:30.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a paramedic! Help!</font>

1279
01:18:32.299 --> 01:18:34.668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a paramedic! Brad!</font>

1280
01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

1281
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:53.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, can we get out of here?</font>

1282
01:18:53.887 --> 01:18:56.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still need to talk
to the detective.</font>

1283
01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:57.788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shouldn't have picked truth.</font>

1284
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:59.457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not your fault.</font>

1285
01:18:59.459 --> 01:19:01.592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I picked truth, too.</font>

1286
01:19:01.594 --> 01:19:03.794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shouldn't have
left Brad alone.</font>

1287
01:19:03.796 --> 01:19:05.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it wouldn't have mattered.</font>

1288
01:19:05.932 --> 01:19:07.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This game is smart.
It's too smart.</font>

1289
01:19:07.767 --> 01:19:09.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not playing it;
it's playing us.</font>

1290
01:19:09.768 --> 01:19:11.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And none of this
is a coincidence.</font>

1291
01:19:11.603 --> 01:19:13.404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It waits for our most
vulnerable moments,</font>

1292
01:19:13.406 --> 01:19:15.739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that's when it asks us.</font>

1293
01:19:15.741 --> 01:19:18.642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah,
you got that right, Olivia.</font>

1294
01:19:18.644 --> 01:19:20.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now it's your turn.</font>

1295
01:19:21.848 --> 01:19:24.418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

1296
01:19:27.086 --> 01:19:29.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1297
01:19:29.488 --> 01:19:30.857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1298
01:19:32.791 --> 01:19:35.059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucas just asked me.</font>

1299
01:19:35.061 --> 01:19:36.828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I didn't.</font>

1300
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:38.190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare, Olivia?</font>

1301
01:19:39.598 --> 01:19:42.867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">O-Okay.
Okay, you have to pick truth.</font>

1302
01:19:42.869 --> 01:19:45.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Olivia, do it.</font>

1303
01:19:45.405 --> 01:19:46.837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dare.
- Olivia!</font>

1304
01:19:46.839 --> 01:19:49.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I dare you...</font>

1305
01:19:49.942 --> 01:19:52.512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to tell Markie
the secret you fear most.</font>

1306
01:19:54.981 --> 01:19:57.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Wh-What is it
making you do?</font>

1307
01:20:00.786 --> 01:20:03.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, there's something
important I need to tell you.</font>

1308
01:20:08.594 --> 01:20:10.396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1309
01:20:13.098 --> 01:20:15.733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was there
the night your dad died.</font>

1310
01:20:15.735 --> 01:20:18.802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what happened.</font>

1311
01:20:18.804 --> 01:20:20.671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1312
01:20:20.673 --> 01:20:22.907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

1313
01:20:22.909 --> 01:20:25.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had gotten into a fight
with my parents,</font>

1314
01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:27.979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I went to your house.</font>

1315
01:20:27.981 --> 01:20:31.582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You weren't there,
so your dad let me in.</font>

1316
01:20:31.584 --> 01:20:35.185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He... he was drinking,
and he offered me one,</font>

1317
01:20:35.187 --> 01:20:36.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I took it.</font>

1318
01:20:36.822 --> 01:20:38.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a few,
and then he told me</font>

1319
01:20:38.892 --> 01:20:41.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he had been fired
that day, 'cause he was,</font>

1320
01:20:41.126 --> 01:20:43.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he was drinking on the job,
and I just,</font>

1321
01:20:43.763 --> 01:20:46.431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I felt really bad for him.</font>

1322
01:20:46.433 --> 01:20:49.434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I told him that you and I</font>

1323
01:20:49.436 --> 01:20:51.505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would help him
figure things out.</font>

1324
01:20:56.776 --> 01:20:58.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then he called me
beautiful.</font>

1325
01:20:58.844 --> 01:21:02.946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And... I was drunk,
and I didn't know what to do,</font>

1326
01:21:02.948 --> 01:21:05.016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then he leaned in
to kiss me,</font>

1327
01:21:05.018 --> 01:21:06.516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I-I tried to push him off.</font>

1328
01:21:06.518 --> 01:21:08.019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't do it, but he...</font>

1329
01:21:08.021 --> 01:21:10.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he kept coming back stronger.</font>

1330
01:21:10.622 --> 01:21:13.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But finally, I-I got free.</font>

1331
01:21:18.063 --> 01:21:20.664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He begged me to forgive him,</font>

1332
01:21:20.666 --> 01:21:22.867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">said that he needed help,
but I was so scared,</font>

1333
01:21:22.869 --> 01:21:24.868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I was confused,</font>

1334
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:26.870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I threatened
to tell you what happened,</font>

1335
01:21:26.872 --> 01:21:28.976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he said that he would die
if you ever found out.</font>

1336
01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:36.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I-I told him that you'd be
better off if he were dead.</font>

1337
01:21:38.718 --> 01:21:41.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, I am so sorry.</font>

1338
01:21:41.653 --> 01:21:45.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to tell you, but
by the time I got ahold of you,</font>

1339
01:21:45.491 --> 01:21:48.025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he had already done it,
and you were devastated.</font>

1340
01:21:48.027 --> 01:21:50.261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It broke my heart.
I didn't know what to do.</font>

1341
01:21:50.263 --> 01:21:52.262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Trust me, I..
- No.</font>

1342
01:21:52.264 --> 01:21:53.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'll never trust you again.</font>

1343
01:21:53.967 --> 01:21:56.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Markie...
- Don't!</font>

1344
01:21:56.902 --> 01:21:58.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't.</font>

1345
01:22:00.005 --> 01:22:02.172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Barron.</font>

1346
01:22:02.174 --> 01:22:03.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're up.</font>

1347
01:22:03.942 --> 01:22:06.910
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"I know the game</i></font>

1348
01:22:06.912 --> 01:22:09.012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"dared you
to set that woman on fire.</font>

1349
01:22:09.014 --> 01:22:10.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Tell me where to meet you,</font>

1350
01:22:10.849 --> 01:22:12.850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"or I'll wait outside
your family's house</font>

1351
01:22:12.852 --> 01:22:16.052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until the game dares me
to do the same to them."</font>

1352
01:22:16.054 --> 01:22:19.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is... quite a threat.</font>

1353
01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:21.659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We traced the I.P.
to your laptop.</font>

1354
01:22:21.661 --> 01:22:23.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I-I know that that...</font>

1355
01:22:23.662 --> 01:22:25.629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">looks bad, but I...</font>

1356
01:22:25.631 --> 01:22:27.632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just needed
to get her attention.</font>

1357
01:22:27.634 --> 01:22:29.199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know
you're playing some kind</font>

1358
01:22:29.201 --> 01:22:31.068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Truth or Dare game,
but what I don't understand is:</font>

1359
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:32.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why are people dying?</font>

1360
01:22:32.205 --> 01:22:34.038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only 4 of you left.</font>

1361
01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:37.275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'd like to keep the rest of you guys alive.
- 4?</font>

1362
01:22:37.277 --> 01:22:38.909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone who's dead
was in Mexico.</font>

1363
01:22:38.911 --> 01:22:40.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That leaves you,
Markie and Lucas,</font>

1364
01:22:40.812 --> 01:22:42.515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Giselle's friend,
Sam Meehan.</font>

1365
01:22:43.916 --> 01:22:45.716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam?</font>

1366
01:22:45.718 --> 01:22:47.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, he's alive?</font>

1367
01:22:47.687 --> 01:22:49.156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know him?</font>

1368
01:22:53.726 --> 01:22:55.626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1369
01:22:55.628 --> 01:22:58.729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that-that's just someone
that Giselle had mentioned.</font>

1370
01:22:58.731 --> 01:23:00.730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah. He's holed up
in an apartment.</font>

1371
01:23:00.732 --> 01:23:03.034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Won't talk to anybody.
Said I had to arrest him</font>

1372
01:23:03.036 --> 01:23:05.136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I wanted to speak
to him again.</font>

1373
01:23:05.138 --> 01:23:07.872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Olivia, what the hell
is happening here?</font>

1374
01:23:07.874 --> 01:23:10.106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could I get some water, please?</font>

1375
01:23:11.744 --> 01:23:13.679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

1376
01:23:19.018 --> 01:23:20.952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus, I'm gonna
need a glass of water.</font>

1377
01:23:20.954 --> 01:23:22.874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir, right away.</font>

1378
01:23:26.625 --> 01:23:28.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I being charged?</font>

1379
01:23:28.327 --> 01:23:30.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yet.</font>

1380
01:23:30.662 --> 01:23:32.933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then I need to go.</font>

1381
01:24:23.415 --> 01:24:25.115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carter is Sam.</font>

1382
01:24:25.117 --> 01:24:27.150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was using a fake name.</font>

1383
01:24:27.152 --> 01:24:29.185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Giselle acted like
they were different people?</font>

1384
01:24:29.187 --> 01:24:31.254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she was probably
trying to protect him,</font>

1385
01:24:31.256 --> 01:24:34.358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but she slipped up and she
used his real name. Come on.</font>

1386
01:25:19.138 --> 01:25:21.875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie? Markie!</font>

1387
01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:26.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie?</font>

1388
01:25:32.919 --> 01:25:35.351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, please open the door.
We need to talk.</font>

1389
01:25:41.326 --> 01:25:43.894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1390
01:25:43.896 --> 01:25:45.995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What my father did.</font>

1391
01:25:45.997 --> 01:25:48.431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, please put it down.</font>

1392
01:25:48.433 --> 01:25:51.235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

1393
01:25:51.237 --> 01:25:53.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have anything.</font>

1394
01:25:53.004 --> 01:25:55.239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have me.</font>

1395
01:25:55.241 --> 01:25:58.242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1396
01:25:58.244 --> 01:26:00.744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now the game has us.</font>

1397
01:26:00.746 --> 01:26:04.448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hid the truth about your dad
to protect you.</font>

1398
01:26:04.450 --> 01:26:07.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I was wrong.</font>

1399
01:26:07.452 --> 01:26:09.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every single day,</font>

1400
01:26:09.287 --> 01:26:11.957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I could take back
what I said to him.</font>

1401
01:26:14.026 --> 01:26:16.263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he tried before.</font>

1402
01:26:18.464 --> 01:26:22.266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not your fault.</font>

1403
01:26:24.269 --> 01:26:28.105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't change the past.</font>

1404
01:26:28.107 --> 01:26:30.106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we can still have a future.</font>

1405
01:26:30.108 --> 01:26:32.109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can end this game.</font>

1406
01:26:32.111 --> 01:26:34.278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How?</font>

1407
01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carter... I know where he is.</font>

1408
01:26:53.432 --> 01:26:55.099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so what's the plan?</font>

1409
01:26:55.101 --> 01:26:58.034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We just have to get him back to the mission.
- Okay.</font>

1410
01:26:58.036 --> 01:27:01.271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So don't open with "We need you
to cut out your own tongue"?</font>

1411
01:27:01.273 --> 01:27:05.074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it is. 6.</font>

1412
01:27:05.076 --> 01:27:08.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go away!
I don't want to talk to anyone!</font>

1413
01:27:08.246 --> 01:27:10.181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Screw this.</font>

1414
01:27:10.183 --> 01:27:11.382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You...</font>

1415
01:27:11.384 --> 01:27:12.583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait, wait, wait!
- Carter!</font>

1416
01:27:12.585 --> 01:27:14.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or is it Sam?</font>

1417
01:27:14.253 --> 01:27:16.319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How did you find me?
- We were motivated.</font>

1418
01:27:16.321 --> 01:27:18.355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell happened in here?
- The game.</font>

1419
01:27:18.357 --> 01:27:22.025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No contact with the outside.
Nothing in here can hurt me.</font>

1420
01:27:22.027 --> 01:27:25.428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is your plan?
- My plan is to wait it out.</font>

1421
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:26.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that was your second plan.</font>

1422
01:27:26.933 --> 01:27:28.399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your first plan
was to screw us.</font>

1423
01:27:28.401 --> 01:27:31.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 of my best friends
are dead because of you!</font>

1424
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:34.270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
I lost friends, too, okay?</font>

1425
01:27:34.272 --> 01:27:36.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I could take it all back,
I would.</font>

1426
01:27:36.342 --> 01:27:37.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is a way.</font>

1427
01:27:37.844 --> 01:27:40.243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we all have to go back
to the mission.</font>

1428
01:27:40.245 --> 01:27:42.413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A way to what?
To what, end the game? How?</font>

1429
01:27:42.415 --> 01:27:46.153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just... trust me.
We have to go back.</font>

1430
01:27:49.222 --> 01:27:52.455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-uh. No, this is
another dare, right?</font>

1431
01:27:52.457 --> 01:27:55.258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The game's daring you to lure me out? Is that...
- No.</font>

1432
01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:57.595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's telling the truth.</font>

1433
01:27:57.597 --> 01:27:59.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why should I trust you?</font>

1434
01:27:59.932 --> 01:28:02.099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we want
the same thing.</font>

1435
01:28:02.101 --> 01:28:03.503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We want to survive.</font>

1436
01:28:05.537 --> 01:28:07.538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look...</font>

1437
01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:10.474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna tell you what you
should've told me at the bar.</font>

1438
01:28:10.476 --> 01:28:12.344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Piss off.</font>

1439
01:28:19.352 --> 01:28:22.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, sweet little Olivia's
not shooting anyone.</font>

1440
01:28:22.287 --> 01:28:25.457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try me. I dare you.</font>

1441
01:28:33.432 --> 01:28:35.332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, let's go.
- I am moving.</font>

1442
01:28:35.334 --> 01:28:38.269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right through here.</font>

1443
01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:40.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

1444
01:28:53.619 --> 01:28:56.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this ritual
that old nun told you about</font>

1445
01:28:56.088 --> 01:28:57.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">actually gonna work?</font>

1446
01:28:57.490 --> 01:28:59.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one way
to find out.</font>

1447
01:29:08.267 --> 01:29:11.435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we're gonna end this
with a seance?</font>

1448
01:29:11.437 --> 01:29:14.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are not ending it.
You are.</font>

1449
01:29:14.205 --> 01:29:16.640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? I tried.</font>

1450
01:29:16.642 --> 01:29:19.012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all know how that
turned out.</font>

1451
01:29:23.515 --> 01:29:25.652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay down.</font>

1452
01:29:27.253 --> 01:29:29.720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Take this. Take it!</font>

1453
01:29:29.722 --> 01:29:31.558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say it 7 times.</font>

1454
01:29:37.263 --> 01:29:39.495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you
gonna do with that?</font>

1455
01:29:39.497 --> 01:29:42.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm giving it to you.</font>

1456
01:29:43.469 --> 01:29:45.569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it. Now!</font>

1457
01:29:45.571 --> 01:29:48.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now say the words 7 times.</font>

1458
01:29:48.607 --> 01:29:50.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

1459
01:29:50.009 --> 01:29:51.240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

1460
01:29:51.242 --> 01:29:53.577
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Hermaro almas..."</i></font>

1461
01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:01.051

- Don't stop.</font>

1462
01:30:01.053 --> 01:30:03.419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just-just tell me what's going on!
- Keep going!</font>

1463
01:30:03.421 --> 01:30:06.356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right...</font>

1472
01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.321

You can't go.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your turn's next.</font>

- Why?</font>

1480
01:30:56.075 --> 01:30:57.775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it dared me to choose.</font>

1481
01:30:57.777 --> 01:30:59.243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You already have.
You love Markie.</font>

1482
01:30:59.245 --> 01:31:01.214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Choose which one of you
to kill.</font>

1483

1484
01:31:07.652 --> 01:31:09.653

1490
01:31:19.764 --> 01:31:22.399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I knew if I didn't,
then one of you would have to.</font>

1491

<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're so close.</font>

to do.</font>

1500
01:31:59.271 --> 01:32:01.437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pick up the knife.</font>

1501
01:32:01.439 --> 01:32:03.242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do it for you.</font>

1502

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pick it up!</font>

1503
01:32:09.214 --> 01:32:10.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And do what?</font>

1504
01:32:10.683 --> 01:32:12.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry, Sam.</font>

1505
01:32:12.884 --> 01:32:14.784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you unleashed this evil,</font>

1506
01:32:14.786 --> 01:32:17.887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which means you're the only one
who can stop it.</font>

1507
01:32:19.892 --> 01:32:22.359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to cut out
your tongue.</font>

1508
01:32:22.361 --> 01:32:24.895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N-No, that's insane.</font>

1509
01:32:24.897 --> 01:32:26.896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please!
It's the only way we survive!</font>

1510
01:32:34.807 --> 01:32:36.773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take care of each other.</font>

1511
01:32:36.775 --> 01:32:39.679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1512
01:32:53.791 --> 01:32:56.095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. No.
- Do it.</font>

1513
01:33:00.532 --> 01:33:02.332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lucas, stop!
- That's not Lucas.</font>

1514
01:33:02.334 --> 01:33:04.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it now, Carter.</font>

1515
01:33:04.603 --> 01:33:07.337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before it's too late!</font>

1516
01:33:07.339 --> 01:33:08.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you want to live?!</font>

1517
01:33:08.573 --> 01:33:11.708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do not have a choice!
Do it!</font>

1518
01:33:11.710 --> 01:33:14.848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe
I'm about to do this.</font>

1519
01:33:22.187 --> 01:33:23.854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will murder
everyone you've ever known!</font>

1520
01:33:23.856 --> 01:33:26.390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they are not in this!
It's just us!</font>

1521
01:33:26.392 --> 01:33:28.792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.</font>

1522
01:33:28.794 --> 01:33:31.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Lucas is,
and he didn't do his dare.</font>

1523
01:33:31.729 --> 01:33:33.363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So now he dies.</font>

1524
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:59.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1525
01:34:21.479 --> 01:34:24.381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucas refused his dare
to save us.</font>

1526
01:34:25.784 --> 01:34:28.385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to finish this.</font>

1527
01:34:28.387 --> 01:34:30.854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calux killed Carter.
The spell won't work.</font>

1528
01:34:30.856 --> 01:34:34.992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we lost the second
we started this game.</font>

1529
01:34:34.994 --> 01:34:39.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The second we came here.</font>

1530
01:34:39.531 --> 01:34:41.632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carter was dared
to bring us here,</font>

1531
01:34:41.634 --> 01:34:44.834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because this is where you can
add new people to the game.</font>

1532
01:34:44.836 --> 01:34:46.636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an idea.
Your turn's next.</font>

1533
01:34:46.638 --> 01:34:48.872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you're asked,
I need you to pick dare.</font>

1534
01:34:48.874 --> 01:34:50.873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I do that?</font>

1535
01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:54.313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie...</font>

1536
01:34:55.414 --> 01:34:56.946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

1537
01:34:56.948 --> 01:34:59.716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now Lucas is asking me.</font>

1538
01:34:59.718 --> 01:35:01.717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pick dare.</font>

1539
01:35:01.719 --> 01:35:04.421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But don't do it.
- What? I'll die.</font>

1540
01:35:04.423 --> 01:35:06.455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Markie, I am so sorry</font>

1541
01:35:06.457 --> 01:35:08.859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for keeping that secret
from you for so long.</font>

1542
01:35:08.861 --> 01:35:10.593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I swear to you</font>

1543
01:35:10.595 --> 01:35:12.596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will never, ever keep
anything from you again.</font>

1544
01:35:12.598 --> 01:35:14.998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we survive this
only if we trust each other.</font>

1545
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

1546
01:35:18.937 --> 01:35:21.437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Trust me.</font>

1547
01:35:21.439 --> 01:35:23.440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to pick.</font>

1548
01:35:23.442 --> 01:35:25.074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dare.</font>

1549
01:35:25.076 --> 01:35:27.977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I dare you to shoot Olivia.</font>

1550
01:35:27.979 --> 01:35:31.547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants me to shoot you.</font>

1551
01:35:31.549 --> 01:35:33.350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to trust me, Markie.
Don't do it.</font>

1552
01:35:33.352 --> 01:35:35.418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the only way
to save us both.</font>

1553
01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:38.323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I trust you.</font>

1554
01:35:41.427 --> 01:35:43.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't do it.</font>

1555
01:35:48.866 --> 01:35:50.467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1556
01:35:53.772 --> 01:35:55.638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dare complete, Calux.</font>

1557
01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:57.341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your turn.</font>

1558
01:35:57.343 --> 01:36:00.110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth or dare?</font>

1559
01:36:00.112 --> 01:36:01.677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not in this game.</font>

1560
01:36:01.679 --> 01:36:03.346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, once you're asked,
you're in.</font>

1561
01:36:03.348 --> 01:36:04.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are the rules, right?</font>

1562
01:36:04.982 --> 01:36:06.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, truth or dare, asshole?</font>

1563
01:36:06.884 --> 01:36:09.618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truth.</font>

1564
01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:13.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do we get out
of this game alive?</font>

1565
01:36:15.626 --> 01:36:17.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't.</font>

1566
01:36:17.729 --> 01:36:20.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carter was the only one
who could stop this.</font>

1567
01:36:20.566 --> 01:36:24.568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So now the game won't end
until all the players are dead.</font>

1568
01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:26.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your turn's next.</font>

1569
01:36:26.972 --> 01:36:31.708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you find
some new friends to play with.</font>

1570
01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:34.781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's not
gonna happen, is it?</font>

1571
01:36:38.683 --> 01:36:41.584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your arm.
- I'm okay.</font>

1572
01:36:41.586 --> 01:36:43.453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, did it work?</font>

1573
01:36:43.455 --> 01:36:45.955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not over.</font>

1574
01:36:45.957 --> 01:36:48.958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The game will never end,
not as long as we're alive.</font>

1575
01:36:50.461 --> 01:36:53.062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1576
01:36:53.064 --> 01:36:55.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm choosing you.</font>

1577
01:37:09.147 --> 01:37:11.782
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My friends and I
went on a trip to Mexico</i></font>

1578
01:37:11.784 --> 01:37:14.818
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>for spring break.</i></font>

1579
01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:16.953
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We ended up in an old mission</i></font>

1580
01:37:16.955 --> 01:37:19.492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where we played a game
of Truth or Dare.</font>

1581
01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had no idea that we had
encountered an unspeakable evil</font>

1582
01:37:26.432 --> 01:37:27.963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that wanted to play with us.</font>

1583
01:37:27.965 --> 01:37:31.501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we went home,
the game kept going.</font>

1584
01:37:31.503 --> 01:37:33.539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It killed 5 of my friends.</font>

1585
01:37:34.705 --> 01:37:36.071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The game is real.</font>

1586
01:37:36.073 --> 01:37:37.908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell the truth, do the dare,</font>

1587
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:40.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or you die;
refuse to play, you die.</font>

1588
01:37:40.211 --> 01:37:45.080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can happen anywhere,
and it can come from anyone.</font>

1589
01:37:45.082 --> 01:37:47.818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry,
but I have to ask you...</font>

1590
01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:49.822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">truth or dare?</font>

1591
01:40:21.839 --> 01:40:25.675
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Truth or dare?</i></font>
