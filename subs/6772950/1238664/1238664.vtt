1
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.320
Can I get
a pack of Morley's?

2
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.510
Yeah.

3
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.792
Truth or dare, Giselle?

4
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.992
Please, I don't wanna
play anymore. Please.

5
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.198
Truth or dare?

6
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.520
No, no! No!

7
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.239
I'm sorry,
I don't have a choice.

8
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.793
<i>You do have a choice.</i>

9
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.070
<i>And I can honestly say,</i>

10
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.551
<i>the pure joy you will feel from
literally building someone's home,</i>

11
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.233
<i>it will stay with you
for the rest of your life.</i>

12
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.878
<i>Unlike all the nights
you won't remember,</i>

13
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.152
and the hangovers you're
really gonna want to forget.

14
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.870
So, for a spring break alternative
that is really good for the soul,

15
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.270
please consider
Habitat for Humanity.

16
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.796
Okay.

17
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.030
Hey!

18
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.436
Hi!

19
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.718
So, I've been doing some thinking,
and I forgive you.

20
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.676
For what?

21
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.316
For saying you can't come on spring break.
I know you didn't mean it.

22
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.755
- Markie.
- Yeah.

23
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.477
I love you so much,
you know that.

24
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.153
But I can't.
I already signed up for Habitat.

25
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.232
- I know.
- Yeah, I'm a trip leader.

26
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.471
No, I know, I know.
It's just...

27
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.639
This is our
last spring break. Ever.

28
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.916
And the thought of doing that
without my best friend?

29
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.279
That breaks my heart.

30
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.791
Since high school, you and I haven't spent
more than a week away from each other.

31
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.349
This is our last chance
to have some fun

32
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.995
before life tears us apart.

33
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.831
- I mean, when you put it that way...
- Yeah.

34
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.550
No, still can't.

35
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.714
Okay. Olivia, whatever happened to
"Between you and the world, I choose you"?

36
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.950
- I still mean that.
- Do you?

37
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.273
Yes, most of the time. This just,
you know, isn't one of those times.

38
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.635
Okay, all right.

39
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.154
You know, I really didn't
wanna have to do this,

40
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.833
but you've left me
no other choice.

41
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.996
I unsigned you up.

42
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.553
- You what?
- Yeah.

43
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.393
I told Habitat
you got shingles.

44
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.758
Which is kind of funny because
roofs have shingles and...

45
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.275
- Markie, that is so...
- Brilliant.

46
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.350
Thank you!

47
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.713
Okay, if you come with us for this
one week of spring break debauchery,

48
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.589
we will all build houses with you
for two weeks over the summer.

49
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.670
We said one week.

50
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.399
We said two.
It'll help with your med school applications.

51
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.470
Like I need the help.

52
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.914
He's in, full 14 days.

53
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.400
So, what's it
going to be, Liv?

54
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.394
I mean, your feeble set of hands for
one week, or all of ours for two?

55
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.874
I mean, you're really just being
selfish if you don't come with us.

56
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.310
Oh, my God!

57
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.275
What did you
put in here?

58
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.350
Shoes.

59
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.039
- It worked?
- Well, that depends.

60
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.554
Are you really gonna help me
build houses this summer?

61
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.353
You had me at
"boys with tools."

62
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.713
And Markie's nothing
if not persistent.

63
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.159
Yup, that is her
most annoying quality.

64
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.795
Glad you're with us,
Girl Scout.

65
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.719
Well,
you know we've always been a package deal.

66
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.440
Oh, yeah.
I'm well aware of that.

67
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.557
- Are you?
- Yeah. I'm okay with it.

68
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.516
Mmm.

69
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.070
- You ready?
- So ready.

70
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.190
Okay, let's go.

71
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.270
Let's do it.

72
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.552
- Do we have everything?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.550
Now we do.

74
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.670
Ooh, ooh!

75
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.353
Spring break, bitches!

76
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.960
That's right, bitches!

77
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.396
<i>There it is!
We're in Mexico.</i>

78
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.239
<i>- Rosarito! Spring break!
- Spring break!</i>

79
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.110
<i>Who's ready
for some</i> cervezas?

80
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.550
<i>- Margaritas!
- Actually, this is like our fourth.</i>

81
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.997
<i>- I love you.
- I love you!</i>

82
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.271
<i>- Such a babe. My God.
- What about me?</i>

83
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.476
<i>Mexico!</i>

84
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.276
<i>Tyson is about to run into the
water and get eaten by a shark.</i>

85
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.836
<i>Beer run, let's go!</i>

86
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.037
<i>We're not drunk yet.</i>

87
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.475
<i>Are you straight? Are you straight?
Are you straight?</i>

88
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.996
<i>All poles, no holes,
you know that.</i>

89
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.550
<i>Hey, get a room.</i>

90
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.791
<i>Lonely souls here at the bar.</i>

91
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.473
<i>- Who wants shots?
- Drink, drink!</i>

92
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.120
<i>Sand dollar! Lucky charm.</i>

93
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.313
<i>Sober friend right here.</i>

94
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.231
<i>There, there.
Yeah! Oh, shit!</i>

95
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.715
<i>I love this.</i>

96
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.915
Whoo!

97
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.829
<i>If you guys watch this later,
I love you, Markie.</i>

98
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.553
<i>Love you, Liv.</i>

99
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.110
<i>Love you, Pen. Love you, Brad.
I love you, Ty.</i>

100
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.273
<i>Let's leave these
losers behind. Let's go.</i>

101
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.635
<i>I just want to
go to one more bar.</i>

102
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.360
Ole!

103
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.518
<i>Oh, I wanna lay you!
Let's go back to the hotel. Come on.</i>

104
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.230
Wow.

105
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.079
They are really going for it.

106
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.840
Well, if you
can't beat 'em...

107
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.440
- Oh!
- Mmm-hmm.

108
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.510
Just like that?

109
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.396
Okay, tell me
what's going on.

110
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.440
Uh, last night
in Mexico. And...

111
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.672
And we're the only two
losers not dancing.

112
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.752
Mmm. If you can
call that dancing.

113
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.995
Definitely not.

114
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.674
Is that for
your YouTube channel?

115
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.154
No, no. YouTube's for my volunteer
stuff and Snapchats are just for fun.

116
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.631
Um, I'm gonna go to the <i>senoritas'.</i>
I'll be right back.

117
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.630
Come on.

118
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.717
Hey, I thought you were
done with this shit.

119
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.072
You're moving in with Lucas,
to D.C., remember?

120
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.480
- Yeah. Yeah.
- What are you doing?

121
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.280
I'm sorry.
I'm so stupid.

122
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.636
I'm just drunk, okay?
You're seriously the best friend ever.

123
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.070
- You good?
- Yeah.

124
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.716
Look who I found,
trying and failing to salsa.

125
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.792
- Oh! Cool.
- I wasn't that bad.

126
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.950
- Hey.
- Hey.

127
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.316
- I missed you. Welcome back.
- I missed you.

128
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.755
I missed you, too.

129
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.040
Yeah.

130
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.158
Olivia! What?

131
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.074
Ronnie? Hi.
What are you doing here?

132
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.311
Oh, I'm just skiing.
What do you think I'm doing here?

133
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.200
I'm getting my spring break on.
Do you wanna join me?

134
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.278
No. Thanks.

135
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.877
Hey, where's Markie?
Maybe we could do a little <i>ménage à trois?</i>

136
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.713
You know what?
She's actually with her boyfriend. Lucas.

137
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.360
What about, like,
a <i>ménage à dos?</i>

138
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.835
- It's just...
- Not happening, pal.

139
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.518
Oh, yeah?
Is there a problem, pal?

140
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.751
No. Just surprised she hasn't
punched you in the face yet.

141
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.195
Guess she's nicer than I am.

142
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.477
Oh, yeah?
How about I punch you in the face? Huh?

143
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.518
Wouldn't be the worst thing
that's happened to me this week.

144
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.071
Okay, Ronnie, calm down.
Seriously, you gotta let it go. All right?

145
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.914
I saw Delta Phi in the back.
They're doing shots.

146
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.992
So you should
really go check it out.

147
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.671
I can't say no to shots.
Everyone knows that.

148
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.393
That's why I'm gonna leave.
Not 'cause of what you said.

149
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.440
You think I'm too nice?

150
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.270
It's a good thing.
Except when dealing with guys at bars, so...

151
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.880
Feel free
to tell me to piss off.

152
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.952
Maybe I just like
being nice.

153
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.713
Can I give it a shot?

154
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.510
I'm Carter.

155
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.716
Olivia.

156
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.076
- Buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

157
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.440
Another beer,
and a margarita for the lady.

158
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.309
Come on! There's gotta be an
all-night bar around here somewhere.

159
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.914
We still have that tequila
back in the room.

160
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.476
But it's our last night in Mexico.
I don't wanna go back to the room.

161
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.955
I know a place
we can go.

162
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.589
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

163
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.200
It's a bit of a hike,
but it's worth it.

164
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.310
Hmm.

165
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.909
Or you can just
tell me to piss off.

166
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.351
I think the hotel room
sounds pretty good. Yeah.

167
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.433
Oh, come on.
It's our final spring break.

168
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.999
"Before life tears us apart."

169
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.516
Right.

170
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.670
We're almost there.

171
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.873
I should have
worn my hiking shoes.

172
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.117
Um, okay.

173
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.759
Should I lay down
some bread crumbs?

174
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.070
Wait, guys, be careful.

175
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.675
I wonder what that means.

176
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.115
How's your Spanish, Brad?

177
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.040
Come on, guys, let's go!

178
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.759
Wow.
This place is interesting.

179
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.320
Kinda terrifying.

180
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.880
There's nothing
to be afraid of. Promise.

181
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.360
Yeah, this is
way better than a club.

182
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.671
Hey. You okay?

183
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.753
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

184
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.715
Just a little tired.

185
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.639
Yeah. We won't stay long.

186
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.399
Where's the tequila?

187
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.793
Hope you've had
your tetanus shot.

188
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.799
I gotta piss.

189
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.551
- Nice. Thank you.
- Cool, cool. Thanks, man.

190
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.920
Oh!

191
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.550
Ugh!

192
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.835
Whoa! Oh! Chill out,
O-dog, it's just me.

193
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.199
Ronnie, did you
follow me here?

194
00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.510
You can't keep Ron-Ron
from a party.

195
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.430
What the hell?

196
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.395
This smells horrible.
What is it? What?

197
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.514
Yo, beer me, bro.

198
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.759
Oh, great, Ronnie's here.

199
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.510
Sure thing, bro.

200
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.036
Um...

201
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.316
You know, we gotta
get up early, so...

202
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.595
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

203
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.473
You guys just got here.

204
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.789
You can't leave now.

205
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.519
Yeah. What's the rush?

206
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.156
Um...

207
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.232
Yeah. Let's, uh,
play a game or something.

208
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.073
Oh, yeah.
Like spin the bottle.

209
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.475
And on that note,
let's, uh...

210
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.313
I was thinking
truth or dare.

211
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.397
What, this a seventh grade
sleepover or...

212
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.358
I know it's a kids' game,
but, if you play it right,

213
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.114
it's a chance to expose
your friends' deepest secrets.

214
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.033
Make 'em do things
they don't want to.

215
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.912
That actually does sound
kind of interesting.

216
00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.710
Uh...

217
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.160
Great. We're in.

218
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.796
Okay, everybody,
get behind me.

219
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.838
- And, one, two, three.
- Smile!

220
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.879
<i>- Queso!</i>
- Will you tag me in that?

221
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.760
Glad you're with us,
Ronnie.

222
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.555
All right.

223
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.710
Well?

224
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.314
Olivia. Truth or dare?

225
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.433
- Whoo!
- Hmm.

226
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.639
- Truth.
- Lame.

227
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.470
Um...

228
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.954
Aliens.

229
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.713
They land right now
and they give you a choice.

230
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.351
They kill everyone in this room
and then leave peacefully,

231
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.713
or they kill the entire
population of Mexico,

232
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.430
but we escape unscathed.
Choose.

233
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.159
What kind of a ridiculous
question is that?

234
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.430
It's a moral dilemma.

235
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.633
- I don't have morals.
- Of course you don't.

236
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.598
Okay, well, obviously,
she's choosing us.

237
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.833
- Sorry, guys.
- What?

238
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.196
You're gonna
let aliens kill us?

239
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.989
I love you, but millions
of people? Come on.

240
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.190
You have to
tell the truth.

241
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.517
I am. It's the only
right answer.

242
00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.830
Ah, whatever.

243
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.271
Well, I'm bored of this already,
so let's get this party started.

244
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.079
- You brought us here.
- Ooh.

245
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.072
Yo, I know how to
amp this up a little bit.

246
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.157
Why don't we get a little
girl-on-girl going?

247
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.230
- No.
- Ronnie...

248
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.800
- I'd watch that.
- Truth or dare?

249
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.956
Dare. Duh.

250
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.392
I dare you to give Tyson
a lap dance for 30 seconds.

251
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.590
No way. No.

252
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.796
- Yep.
- I won't do it.

253
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.519
Once you're asked, you're in.
It's the rules.

254
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.195
There's, like, three chicks here.
You couldn't dare...

255
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.517
- This sucks! So wack!
- Get over here.

256
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.000
- Just do it.
- Get it.

257
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.629
- Take it off.
- No tips, no touching, bro.

258
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.240
Don't make this a thing.

259
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.436
- Hold this.
- Don't make this weird.

260
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.711
This is gonna be the longest 30
seconds of my life. Let's go. Come on.

261
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.194
- Whoo! Take it off.
- All right.

262
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.595
He's done this before.

263
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.080
I think
he kinda likes it.

264
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.150
We got a real pro here.

265
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.754
Look at that technique.

266
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.439
- Ooh! Look at that.
- Ronnie! Ronnie!

267
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.715
He's done this before.
Look at that.

268
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.916
Make it rain pesos.

269
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.116
I don't want your pesos.

270
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.550
Aww. Cheer up.

271
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.391
Okay, all right. Lucas?
Truth or dare? This sucks.

272
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.510
Hmm.

273
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.992
Okay, who's ready?

274
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.118
Whoo-hoo!

275
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.074
Okay, guys, I promise you it's
just because it's cold in here.

276
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.190
I have no judgment.

277
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.078
Scarred for life.

278
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.760
Hold your applause, please.
Thank you.

279
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.553
- Quite the show.
- Thank you.

280
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.070
Okay, Markie's turn.

281
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.152
I got this one.
Truth or dare?

282
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.150
Uh, truth.

283
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.280
Are you aware that Olivia is
in love with your boyfriend?

284
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.794
- No, she's not.
- Come on, it's so obvious.

285
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.713
Will you stop being
such an asshole?

286
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.870
Just being truthful.

287
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.396
- Hey, Tyson, shut up!
- Don't tell me to shut up.

288
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.676
What the hell
is wrong with you?

289
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.832
Dude, we're all here because she's trying
to make you jealous, like, clearly.

290
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.832
Why are you always starting shit, dude?
Hey! Stop!

291
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.719
Can somebody tell the truth?
That would be great!

292
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.440
Stop it with the agro-posturing
and just get to my turn, please.

293
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.195
- Brad, truth or dare?
- Yes. Truth.

294
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.512
If you had to make out with anyone here,
who would it be?

295
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.433
It's okay
if you're bi-curious.

296
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.271
Scruffy boy over there.

297
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.280
- Come on!
- I'm flattered.

298
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.631
Tyson, truth or dare?

299
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.030
- Dare.
- I dare you

300
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.760
to stop selling forged
prescriptions to freshmen.

301
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.278
Olivia, always with
the moral high ground.

302
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.519
Fine. I make more money
off upperclassmen anyway.

303
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.114
Oh, my God.

304
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.511
Uh, Penelope,
truth or dare?

305
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.196
- Dare.
- Make out with Olivia.

306
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.270
Ronnie!

307
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.158
Why not? Just try.
It could be fun.

308
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.478
Didn't see that one coming.

309
00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.270
It's okay, Liv.
Just close your eyes and pretend it's Lucas.

310
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.675
You know what...

311
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.996
Wow.

312
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.276
Maybe I'm bi-curious.

313
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.600
Tight. It's tight.

314
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.156
Carter, you're up.

315
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.439
Truth or dare?

316
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.910
Uh, truth.

317
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.993
What are your intentions
with our sweet Olivia?

318
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.478
I needed to find someone with friends
that I could trick into coming here.

319
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.830
I could tell Olivia was a pushover,
which made her an easy target.

320
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.996
I brought you all up here
to play this game because...

321
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.357
I'm okay with strangers dying
if it means I get to live.

322
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.234
Uh...

323
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.076
I'm sorry,
but you should've told me to piss off.

324
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.400
Wait, what's up?

325
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.430
What the hell?

326
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.753
Look, I know.
It sounds insane, but the game is real.

327
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.996
Once you're asked,
you're in.

328
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.516
Okay? Wherever you go,
whatever you do, it'll find you.

329
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.876
Hey, don't, don't.
Tell the truth or you die.

330
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.394
Do the dare or you die.

331
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.472
Refuse to play...

332
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.030
Just follow the rules.

333
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.276
Guys?

334
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.954
Guys?

335
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.200
You okay?

336
00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.950
Yeah.

337
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.435
Yeah, I'm fine.

338
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.675
Guy's a jerk.

339
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.514
Wanna get out of here?

340
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.912
Yeah. Great way
to end the trip, Liv.

341
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.796
Make sure you make it home
next weekend, son.

342
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.240
Gotcha.

343
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.599
- Hi.
- Hey!

344
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.720
All good with Officer Dad?

345
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.793
Oh, absolutely,
now that he thinks I spent my last week

346
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.714
belly-bumping my nonexistent
girlfriend in wine country.

347
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.395
Your Canadian lady,
she really does like a good Merlot.

348
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.230
Uh, her name is Kimberly,
and her palate is quite refined, thank you.

349
00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.671
Oh, sorry. My apologies
to Canadian Kim.

350
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.560
Remind me why I didn't go to
school thousands of miles away

351
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.599
from my overbearing
and homophobic father.

352
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.558
- Because you never say no to him?
- Mmm.

353
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.711
And you never
would've met me.

354
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.239
Are you sure you don't
wanna be my beard?

355
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.278
Because I really wanna
ghost Kimberly.

356
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.909
Yeah, I doubt that would
solve either of our problems.

357
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.355
How is Markie?

358
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.916
I don't know.

359
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.197
Haven't talked to her much
since we've been back.

360
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.239
Don't worry about us.
We're friends for life.

361
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.959
- Bye.
- See you.

362
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.559
- Hi, Olivia.
- Hi.

363
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.230
Here you go.

364
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.834
God bless you.

365
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.310
Hey! We made mojitos!
Study party?

366
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.960
Yeah, maybe later.

367
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.515
Okay.

368
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.640
Olivia, um, Pen was saying that
I was a bit of a dick in Mexico,

369
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.032
so here's a little something
to make it up to you.

370
00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.839
A prescription?

371
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.919
What? You're not a freshman.

372
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.878
Yeah, you're not a doctor.

373
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.599
That's not what
my lucky pen says.

374
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.274
I thought I was
your lucky Pen.

375
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.354
Oh, baby,
but you are my lucky Pen-elope.

376
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.398
- Oh, my lucky Pen!
- Tyson! Tyson!

377
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.240
<i>Roy Cameron, 45 years old,
attempts to make dinner. Take one.</i>

378
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.078
<i>A little faith, please.</i>

379
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.675
<i>Nobody makes a steak
like your old man.</i>

380
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.752
<i>Uh, Dad,
I'm pescatarian now.</i>

381
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.995
<i>Right, and that's why
I meant to say</i>

382
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.036
<i>swordfish steaks! Boom!</i>

383
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.520
<i>God,
you are such a dork!</i>

384
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.637
<i>But you still love me, right?</i>

385
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.958
<i>Yeah, yeah, I still love you.</i>

386
00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.150
<i>Good.</i>

387
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.040
- Sorry.
- Hey.

388
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.035
Come bearing gifts.

389
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.954
Penelope said you didn't want one.
I know you better than that.

390
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.911
Yeah, you're right.
Probably could use a drink.

391
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.800
So, I know
things have been

392
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.032
a little Bette and Joan
between us since Mexico.

393
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.596
But awkwardness
stops here. Okay?

394
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.118
Since my dad took his life,
you've been my only family.

395
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.480
The one person I can really trust,
so I'm not gonna let

396
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.236
a stupid comment by Tyson,
of all people, change that.

397
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.390
Markie,

398
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.152
I promise you,

399
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.994
I do not have feelings
for your boyfriend.

400
00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.153
He's like a brother
to me. Okay?

401
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.114
Okay. Yeah.

402
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.556
Between you and the world,
I choose you.

403
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.360
And I choose you.

404
00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.309
Mmm.

405
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.710
- Oh, my God. That is...
- Wow.

406
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.070
- Very strong.
- Yeah.

407
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.670
Hey, asshole!

408
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.115
Do you think that's funny?

409
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.310
Think what's funny?

410
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.360
I don't get it.

411
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.713
My desk and the flyer
were harmless.

412
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.917
But it's gonna cost me a
lot of money to fix my car.

413
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.912
Okay, I am so lost right now.
What are you talking about?

414
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.959
You keyed "truth or dare"
into my car door.

415
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.394
There's nothing
on your car.

416
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.199
Except your idea
of a lame joke.

417
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.836
Okay, you're a little crazy.
But you know what?

418
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.832
I actually happen to like crazy.
Do you wanna maybe

419
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.515
- get a drink sometime?
- Can you just leave me alone, okay?

420
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.114
Is that a no?

421
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.320
Hey, Sarah,
have you seen Markie?

422
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.595
In the library.

423
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.229
Hey, Olivia?

424
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.794
Truth or dare?

425
00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.394
What did you say?

426
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.355
Truth or dare?

427
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.120
Truth or dare?

428
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.237
Truth or dare?

429
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.875
Truth or dare? Truth or dare?

430
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.076
Truth or dare?

431
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.436
Truth or dare? Truth or dare?

432
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.672
Truth or dare? Truth or dare?
Truth or dare?

433
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.194
Truth! Stop!

434
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.789
What secret does your
best friend make you hide?

435
00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.395
Markie's constantly
cheating on Lucas.

436
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.950
That true?

437
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.830
Markie...

438
00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.756
Luke...

439
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.590
Lucas.

440
00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.630
Wait!

441
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.350
Markie, I don't know
what's going on.

442
00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.790
He's like a brother
to you?

443
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.111
No, I'm serious.
I'm seeing things.

444
00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.036
Touch me again
and I'll break that hand.

445
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.309
Seriously!

446
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.589
Yo! 'Sup?
You wanna play?

447
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.757
You look like a girl
who's good with balls.

448
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.878
Please do not talk to me.

449
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.795
No, look, uh, just one game.
I just wanna show you my pool cue.

450
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.950
Okay.

451
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.117
By pool cue, I mean penis.
I'm referring to my penis.

452
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.072
Maybe we could have sex.
You know. See what happens.

453
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.112
Truth or dare, Ronnie?

454
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.753
What, did Olivia
put you up to this?

455
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.117
Truth or dare?

456
00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.194
Uh, creepy. And sexy.
Let's do it. Dare.

457
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.591
Get on the table and show
everyone your pool cue.

458
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.073
I knew it. Okay.

459
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.880
Hello, friends and neighbors!

460
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.269
This fine young lady here

461
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.716
has asked me to play a little
game of truth or dare with her.

462
00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.911
- And like a real gentleman, I chose dare.
- Go, Ronnie!

463
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.116
Whoo!

464
00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.911
Anyway, now, I will do you all the
honor of showing you my business.

465
00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.117
Seen it before!
Not impressed!

466
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.152
Oh!

467
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.796
- Who is that? Beth?
- No.

468
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.280
But Beth said
it was tiny, too.

469
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.759
No! Beth would
never say that!

470
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.752
Okay, you know what?
Screw this, I'm out.

471
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.470
Whoa! Careful, dude!
Watch the pool cue, man!

472
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.670
Thank you.

473
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.950
Yeah.

474
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.510
Somebody call 911!

475
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.752
<i>I swear to you.
People were talking to me.</i>

476
00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.480
<i>It looked like a messed up
Snapchat filter.</i>

477
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.151
They were asking me "Truth or dare?"
over and over again.

478
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.080
And I panicked.

479
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.040
So you're saying a mob of
people chanting in unison

480
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.510
made you tell Lucas that
Markie is a cheating whore.

481
00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.274
Look, I know
it sounds insane!

482
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.511
- Just a little.
- But it happened.

483
00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.951
Something really weird has been
going on ever since Mexico.

484
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.190
Oh, come on!

485
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.751
Keeping a secret like that,
it's a huge burden.

486
00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.277
None of us would fault you for
trying to get it off your chest.

487
00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.433
Not maybe so publicly.

488
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.917
I wish you would have done it
for your YouTube channel.

489
00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.833
I will stab you with this.

490
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.275
Calm down, baby.

491
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.640
Basic Beth again.

492
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.950
Holy shit!

493
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.438
<i>Excuse me,
friends and neighbors!</i>

494
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.319
<i>This fine young lady
right here</i>

495
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.437
<i>has asked me to play a game
of truth or dare with her.</i>

496
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.160
<i>And like a real gentleman,
I chose dare.</i>

497
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.232
<i>Anyway, now I will do you all the
honor of showing you my business.</i>

498
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.834
- Gross.
- Ugh!

499
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.630
<i>Call 911.</i>

500
00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.710
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

501
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.916
Bad break.

502
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.517
- It's a pool joke.
- That's not funny.

503
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.959
It's the game.

504
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.712
- What?
- It is. It followed us home.

505
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.870
Are you being
serious right now?

506
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.110
Carter told me
that it was real.

507
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.396
That we were all in
and that it would find us.

508
00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.519
We're really taking the word of
our mentally unstable tour guide?

509
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.075
How else do you explain what
happened to me in the library, huh?

510
00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.873
- And now Ronnie?
- Oh, I don't know.

511
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.316
Maybe he was drunk and he fell off a
pool table, which is what happened.

512
00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.756
So, it's just a coincidence that he
was supposed to be doing a dare?

513
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.830
- Yes.
- No!

514
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.277
Carter said, "Tell the truth or you die.
Do the dare or you die."

515
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.751
Ronnie chickened out.
He did not do his dare, and now he's dead.

516
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.476
Guys, tell me
I'm not crazy!

517
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.119
No, you definitely
sound crazy.

518
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.870
Lucas,

519
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.115
I am so sorry
for what I said,

520
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.119
but I swear to you,
something forced me to say that.

521
00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.072
And I need you
to believe me.

522
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.470
Please.

523
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.439
Kind of hard to believe someone
who's been lying to you for so long.

524
00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.600
See you guys.

525
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.073
<i>Anyway, now I will do you all the
honor of showing you my business.</i>

526
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.150
<i>Lucas.</i>

527
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.633
<i>Lucas.</i>

528
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.829
<i>Lucas.</i>

529
00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.077
That's very funny, guys.

530
00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.632
Okay, this is insane.

531
00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.710
Hey.

532
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.600
I believe you.

533
00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.794
<i>Something started burning
"truth or dare" into my arm.</i>

534
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.354
Oh, my God, are you okay?

535
00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.000
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.197
I mean... It's gone now,

537
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.314
but I felt it, Olivia.
It was really painful.

538
00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.718
Yeah. And when I was in the library,
I was surrounded by people,

539
00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.632
but what we're seeing
is not real.

540
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.238
Only the consequences are.

541
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.639
Did you answer?

542
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.598
<i>Lucas, you have to answer.</i>

543
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.320
I've had feelings for Olivia
since we met.

544
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.240
Sometimes I wonder what it'd be
like to be with her instead of

545
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.556
<i>Markie.</i>

546
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.755
I wonder what it'd be like
to wake up next to her.

547
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.109
<i>To kiss her.</i>

548
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.396
<i>But I know
that can never happen.</i>

549
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.358
Oh, God, please tell me
you didn't hang up.

550
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.591
We have to
convince everybody else.

551
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.835
I'm coming.

552
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.360
What is all this?

553
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.749
An intervention?

554
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.912
I always thought day-drinking
Penelope would be first.

555
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.110
Thanks.

556
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.670
Thank you for coming.

557
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.080
I live here.

558
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.833
So, what is it all about?

559
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.036
The game.

560
00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.680
We're still playing it in the
same order we played in Mexico.

561
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.077
Carter told us the truth.
The game is real.

562
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.197
First, it was my turn.
I got asked in the library,

563
00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.033
and it made me tell your secret.
Then it was Ronnie's turn.

564
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.953
He didn't do his dare
and it killed him.

565
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.349
Maybe you and Ronnie
shouldn't have answered.

566
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.280
Carter also said,
"Refuse to play and you die."

567
00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.352
I got asked tonight
and I tried to ignore it.

568
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.314
But then something burned
"truth or dare" on my arm, Markie.

569
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.516
Show me.

570
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.515
I think
it's gone now, but...

571
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.353
There's nothing there.

572
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.000
Because I told
the truth.

573
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.840
- Oh, my... Jeez.
- Wow, Olivia.

574
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.880
I mean, this is next-level.

575
00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.676
You can't take responsibility for
humiliating me in front of everyone

576
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.240
and ruining my relationship,

577
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.632
so you come up with some insane
story that a game made you say it?

578
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.272
Then you get Lucas to lie for you?
No, I'm done.

579
00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.671
Markie. Markie! Stop!

580
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.430
You can't be alone.

581
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.590
Why not?

582
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.071
Because in the picture,
your turn is next.

583
00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.472
Unknown number.
Of course it is.

584
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.350
"Truth or dare?"

585
00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.600
Wow. A text, really? I mean, there's
no way a human could've sent this out.

586
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.273
Just answer it.

587
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.990
Fine.

588
00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:27.950
Dare.

589
00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.031
"Dare you to follow through
with your promise.

590
00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.759
"Break Olivia's hand."

591
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.830
Obviously, this was you.

592
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.992
Do you see me
texting you right now?

593
00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.916
No, but you were the only
one there when I said that.

594
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.560
Markie, why would I
dare you

595
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.950
- to break my own hand?
- I don't know!

596
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.316
Maybe you're making a new YouTube
video on how to lose friends.

597
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.960
That seems even less likely.

598
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.596
What are you doing?

599
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.796
You have to do it.

600
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.950
What?

601
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.870
You have to.

602
00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.277
Ronnie didn't do his dare
and now he's dead.

603
00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.954
Liv, this is
so messed up.

604
00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.554
Even by my standards.

605
00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.279
Look, as pissed as I am at you right now,
and I'm so pissed,

606
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.840
there's no way
I'm gonna break your hand.

607
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.832
Well, you don't really
have a choice.

608
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.431
So just take it. Please.

609
00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.879
Markie, I don't wanna find out
what happens if you don't.

610
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.350
Just do it.

611
00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.470
No. I can't.

612
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.991
God, just trust me, Markie.
Do it. Please.

613
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.476
Oh, don't tell me you're a
fucking coward like your dad!

614
00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.118
Oh, shit.

615
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.394
Oh, my God.

616
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.358
I'll get some ice.

617
00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.876
I can't deal with this crazy right now.
I got a med school interview tomorrow.

618
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.514
See a doctor!

619
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.353
- I'm sorry! Sorry!
- Guys!

620
00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.954
Oh, God.
- We gotta go to the hospital, okay?

621
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.076
- Come on.
- Okay.

622
00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.160
<i>You believe all this?</i>

623
00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.879
I don't know
what to believe.

624
00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.080
Come on.

625
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.110
Come on.

626
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.440
Brad...

627
00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.594
Truth or dare?

628
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.075
Brad...

629
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.272
Truth!

630
00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.430
Brad?

631
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.638
Hey. What are you
doing here?

632
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.792
Uh, my job.
Why you here?

633
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.991
Friend of mine got hurt.
It's nothing serious.

634
00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.549
I'm just here
for moral support.

635
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.914
Something wrong?

636
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:18.111
Yeah, no, I'm just
a little shaken up.

637
00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.560
You haven't come by to see
your mother in a few weeks.

638
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.679
Yeah, I know,
I'm sorry.

639
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.160
I thought I was
paying for this school

640
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.594
so you could come home
every once in a while.

641
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.512
I know, I know...

642
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.479
Things have been
a little crazy lately.

643
00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.029
You know,
I don't wanna hear excuses, son.

644
00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.515
I want the truth.

645
00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.190
There goes another $1,000
in credit card debt.

646
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.430
Oh, my God, Liv.

647
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.990
I just had my turn.

648
00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.830
You what?

649
00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:53.073
The game, it made me, uh,
come out to my father.

650
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.400
Are you okay?

651
00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.751
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

652
00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.674
For the first time in my life,
I told him my truth,

653
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.198
and I stood up to him
and I feel awesome.

654
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.552
Okay, hold on.
Your dad didn't know that you were gay?

655
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.069
Your ringtone's Beyoncé.

656
00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.713
Everyone loves Beyoncé.

657
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.154
Tyson's next.

658
00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.874
Will do.

659
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.230
Tyson Curran?

660
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.000
Let's do this.

661
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.149
Right this way.

662
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.636
So, you come from
a family of doctors, then?

663
00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:59.236
Yes, ma'am. Mother, father,
sister, uncle, and grandfather.

664
00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.720
Pretty much everybody.

665
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.632
Well, they must have
set a great example

666
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.154
for you to want to
take the same route.

667
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.596
Yes, absolutely,
Dean Spencer.

668
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.151
Growing up, I would hear their
stories about saving lives,

669
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.996
and I think that
somehow shaped me.

670
00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.799
Pen! Where's Tyson?

671
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.917
His med school
interview. Why?

672
00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.589
You know,

673
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:33.960
I could do something self-serving,
like become a hedge fund manager.

674
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.157
The thing is,
people need help,

675
00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.953
especially in
times like these.

676
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.679
That's very noble of you.

677
00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.036
You know, I just have
one final question.

678
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.913
He hasn't had his turn yet.

679
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.356
Mr. Curran, your bag.

680
00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.713
Wait, Tyson, no!
Wait, Tyson!

681
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.314
Can I help you?

682
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.510
Truth or dare?

683
00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.233
I'm sorry,
I beg your pardon?

684
00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.630
Truth or dare?

685
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.236
Truth, I guess.

686
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.913
Did my friends really
put you up to this?

687
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.878
How long have you been
forging prescriptions?

688
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.430
I don't.

689
00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.193
Did she actually
tell you that?

690
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.430
Excuse me?

691
00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.752
I don't forge prescriptions.
Why would you even ask me that?

692
00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.755
Um...

693
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.956
Ty! Tys!

694
00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.110
Ty! Open the door!

695
00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.830
Tyson?

696
00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.193
- Tyson!
- Are you okay?

697
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.794
Open the door!
Come on! Listen! Tys!

698
00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.030
What are you doing?

699
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.592
Oh! Oh, my God!

700
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.995
Oh, my God!

701
00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.670
Tyson lied and then
died because of it.

702
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.440
Just like Ronnie did
when he didn't do the dare.

703
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.915
And my turn's next.

704
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.070
Yeah, pick truth.

705
00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.477
I mean, listen,
we all should. Right?

706
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.234
Then whatever question
that we get asked,

707
00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.754
we just answer it
with 100% honesty.

708
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.231
Okay, that's how we're gonna
survive till we figure this out.

709
00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.110
We got it?

710
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.792
Only choose truth.

711
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.395
Need more vodka.

712
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.153
You need sleep.

713
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.155
Okay, I'll put her in bed.

714
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.920
You guys find Carter.

715
00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.191
He started all this.
Maybe he can end it.

716
00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.832
He said that
he went to USC.

717
00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.273
Five Carters,
none of them our guy.

718
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.352
Maybe he meant
the other USC?

719
00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.997
All right, she's asleep.
Did you find Carter yet?

720
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.755
No, dead end.

721
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.399
Did you try using Google?

722
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.952
Search "Mexico truth or dare."

723
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.154
Uh, guys?

724
00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.757
"Suspect Giselle Hammond, 22,
an American college student

725
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.277
"had gone missing while on
spring break in Rosarito Beach.

726
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.111
"The clerk recounted Hammond's
bizarre behavior before the incident,

727
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.432
"which is backed up
with surveillance footage."

728
00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.230
<i>Pack of Morley's.</i>

729
00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.433
<i>I don't
wanna play anymore.</i>

730
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.070
<i>Dare.</i>

731
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.119
<i>I'm sorry,
I don't have a choice.</i>

732
00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.476
Holy shit.

733
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.359
Did they catch her?

734
00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.080
Uh... No, it says there's
still an ongoing search.

735
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.274
I just found her on Facebook.

736
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.635
What?

737
00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.840
Oh, my God. It's him.

738
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.675
Is he tagged?

739
00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.717
No, I don't see him
in any other photos.

740
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.354
Look at her wall.
Maybe he posted.

741
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.558
Not that I see,
but there's a bunch of posts

742
00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.199
about people asking her
to turn herself in.

743
00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.270
Stuff like that.

744
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.073
Wait, do you think
she's checking this?

745
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.834
- DM her.
- Wait.

746
00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:21.039
Just, uh, make a fake account.
We don't want this shit traced to us.

747
00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.029
Yeah.

748
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.869
<i>So,
we're here on our first vacation together.</i>

749
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.519
<i>Is it our
first vacation together?</i>

750
00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.592
<i>Um, there was
that time you came</i>

751
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.240
<i>and visited me
and my family in Texas.</i>

752
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.310
<i>Right?</i>

753
00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.433
<i>You're from Texas?
I thought you're from Mexico.</i>

754
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.312
<i>From Mexico?</i>

755
00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.150
<i>Tyson!</i>

756
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.390
We're playing
the game, too.

757
00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.758
We need your help.

758
00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.670
Please meet me.

759
00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.479
This woman
is wanted for murder.

760
00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.199
Do you really think she's
gonna come out of hiding

761
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.760
for "We need your help"?

762
00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.600
I know the game dared you
to set that woman on fire.

763
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.316
Tell me
where to meet you,

764
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.279
or I'll wait outside
your family's house

765
00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.636
until the game dares me
to do the same to them.

766
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.712
Markie,
you cannot send that!

767
00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.679
If you want to live,
you need to stop thinking about other people

768
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.831
and start thinking
about yourself!

769
00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.754
Truth or dare, beautiful?

770
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.510
What?

771
00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.319
Hard to make a decision without
Tyson telling you what to do?

772
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.350
Screw you!

773
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.830
Truth.

774
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.679
Truth or dare?

775
00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.514
I said truth!

776
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.071
Sorry, that's not
how this game works.

777
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.112
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

778
00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.679
Be patient.
She'll write back.

779
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.593
This is all my fault.

780
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.636
Hey, no, it's not.

781
00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:27.710
No, she's right.

782
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.996
None of us wanted
to follow that creep.

783
00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.833
None of us wanted
to play that stupid game.

784
00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.880
The only reason I went on that
trip was for you, remember?

785
00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.599
You said you needed
your best friend.

786
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.319
- All right, come on, guys.
- No, but now I realize

787
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.357
it's not about friendship
or "I choose you."

788
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.352
It's about me being there
to cover your ass

789
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.635
while you hooked up
with randoms!

790
00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.710
Hey.

791
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.234
Screw you, Olivia.

792
00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.076
Was that necessary?

793
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:02.792
Guys, come outside! Now!

794
00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.791
Pen!
What are you doing?

795
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.156
I tried. It wouldn't
let me pick truth.

796
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.152
I tried, I swear!

797
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.515
I have to walk the edge
until I finish this!

798
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.559
Pen,
you're gonna be fine!

799
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.916
Okay, just go slow.
Take your time.

800
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.236
- Be careful!
- Oh, jeez!

801
00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.040
I'm gonna go up there. I'll try and
grab her if she loses her balance.

802
00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.759
No, your hand's broken.
I'll go.

803
00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.190
Pen, just walk slowly, okay?

804
00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.679
Hey! Just take
your time, okay?

805
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.717
Walk slowly. It's gonna be fine.
What do we do?

806
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.553
Be careful,
it's gonna be okay.

807
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.074
- Okay.
- You're gonna be okay.

808
00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.556
We need to grab something
in case she falls. Go inside.

809
00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.750
I'm gonna clear a path.

810
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.910
All right,
let's go, let's go!

811
00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.560
Pen!

812
00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.116
Be careful!

813
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.954
You're good, okay?

814
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.350
Hey, will this work?

815
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.000
What? Yeah.
Yeah. Come on.

816
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.716
Just get under her.
Get under her and follow her.

817
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.510
Be careful, Pen.

818
00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.553
Go!
Get back, get back.

819
00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.314
No need to rush.

820
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.150
It's okay.

821
00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.230
It's okay, Pen.

822
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.272
Just take your time.
Take it slowly.

823
00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.596
Just put one foot
in front of the other.

824
00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.757
Watch it, okay?
Just go slow.

825
00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.474
You can do this.

826
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.120
We're right here.
We're here for you, okay?

827
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.071
I see her, she's right there.
Go, go, go!

828
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.276
Wait, she's on the corner.

829
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.350
There she is.

830
00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.070
Get that stuff
out of the way!

831
00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.315
Pen!

832
00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.635
I'm coming, I'm coming!

833
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.434
No, no, no,
don't get too close!

834
00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.756
If I cheat,
if I don't do the dare...

835
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.872
I know, I know. Okay?

836
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.676
But when you finish,
I'll be here to grab you.

837
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.351
Just gotta go around
this corner now, okay?

838
00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:30.596
Okay.

839
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.350
Oh...

840
00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.670
Come on.

841
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.834
Take your time, okay?

842
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.629
You're doing great, Pen.
Don't look down.

843
00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.313
- Stay here, stay below her.
- Okay.

844
00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.595
Wait, where are you going?

845
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.110
Hey, Pen, don't look
at the fence. Okay?

846
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.591
Look at me, okay? You're almost there.
Just a little more.

847
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.434
She's right above us.
Throw it on top.

848
00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.590
- You ready?
- Yeah.

849
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.670
That's not gonna work.

850
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.030
That might.

851
00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.791
Oh! Hey! Penelope!

852
00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:41.870
Shit.

853
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.710
- Guys, get back further. Get back!
- Go, go, go.

854
00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.910
One last sip.

855
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.277
No. Pen!

856
00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.794
Hey! Pen! No! No!

857
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.910
Pen!

858
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:12.990
She's not moving.

859
00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.116
Pen.

860
00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.636
Is this my bed?

861
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.990
Yeah.

862
00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.156
You're okay.

863
00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.320
I just got a Facebook
message from Giselle.

864
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:58.078
We're sure this is a good idea,
meeting her here?

865
00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.640
What if the cops
trace her message?

866
00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.200
No, she wrote us
on a fake account.

867
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.711
Yeah, but that chick lit somebody on fire.
She's probably nuts.

868
00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.473
I mean, do we really
have another choice?

869
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.557
We can talk about this inside.
Come on.

870
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.070
Let's go.

871
00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.270
Inside?

872
00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.430
Uh-uh.

873
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.910
Okay, all right, that's far enough.
Tell us what's happening.

874
00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.710
Which one of you's Olivia?

875
00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.712
No, you answer our question
first. How do you know Carter?

876
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.075
- "Carter"?
- Cut the crap.

877
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.358
We saw the photo.
He's the one who brought us into this game.

878
00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.279
Yeah, right, okay.
Carter, right.

879
00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.073
Did he bring you
into this, too?

880
00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.993
No, he didn't.
He didn't start this.

881
00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.436
He was just
one of my friends.

882
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.956
We all went on a trip to
Mexico and got really wasted.

883
00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.237
We found this old church,
and we decided to party in it,

884
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.676
and my roommate wanted to play truth or dare,
so we did.

885
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.878
But when we got home,
the game, it just kept going.

886
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.480
My roommate died first
and then the other ones and...

887
00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:57.835
How is this possible?

888
00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.874
I wish I knew.

889
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.913
I thought this was some kind of karmic
payback for Sam trashing the place.

890
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:03.990
"Sam"?

891
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.677
Uh, yeah, Sam.
He was one of my friends.

892
00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:09.395
He got really drunk and he
just started breaking stuff.

893
00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.314
I don't know.
We were all being idiots. I don't...

894
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.675
Our friend just had
a turn in the game.

895
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.160
It wouldn't let her pick "truth."
Do you know why?

896
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.320
It's how we played.
We called it "two truths and a dare."

897
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.239
If two people pick truth in a row,
then the next person had to do a dare.

898
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.280
Thought it was
more fun that way.

899
00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:26.960
More fun?

900
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.952
Your asshole buddy
gave us a death sentence.

901
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.072
Any more super dangerous rules
you wanna tell us about?

902
00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.196
Easy, Pen.

903
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.273
He told me he was dared to
find a new group to play.

904
00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:39.512
And that it had to be at the mission.
He didn't have a choice.

905
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.829
Of course he did.

906
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.713
Okay, so
where is Carter now?

907
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.478
I haven't talked to him
since he went back to Mexico.

908
00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:48.514
I thought that when he got a new
group to play, that we would be out.

909
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.672
I can't believe he only
got five of you to play.

910
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.916
If he would've gotten more,

911
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.959
then I would've had a longer
time before I had to go again.

912
00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.960
You got another turn?

913
00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.240
Okay. It's time
to go, guys.

914
00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.794
Is this why you're
telling us the truth?

915
00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.920
No. I, uh, I picked "dare."

916
00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.434
Markie's right.
Let's get out of here.

917
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.000
Okay, we're leaving.
Come on, Olivia.

918
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.671
I am so sorry, Olivia.

919
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.037
How did you know my name
when I got here?

920
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.879
I didn't put it
in the message.

921
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.519
No!

922
00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.710
- No!
- Pen!

923
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:23.954
Brad! No! No!

924
00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:30.157
- Hold her down!
- I have to kill Olivia!

925
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.516
Stop moving.

926
00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.190
What the...

927
00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.640
No! No!

928
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.870
No, no!

929
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.430
Oh, shit.

930
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.715
What was she thinking?

931
00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.073
It wasn't her.

932
00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.719
Something took over
like she was possessed.

933
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.916
She didn't finish her dare.

934
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.995
Like Ronnie.
This is what happens.

935
00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.314
So what do we do?

936
00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.112
We tell the truth.

937
00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.035
She was erratic,
said she had to kill me.

938
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.634
Then Penelope pushed me
out of the way,

939
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.359
she shot her and then
turned the gun on herself.

940
00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.631
Were you aware that Giselle
Hammond was wanted for murder?

941
00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:35.750
Yes.

942
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.553
Yeah, we thought that she knew
someone that we were looking for.

943
00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.393
A guy that we met in Mexico,
his name was Carter.

944
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.156
You don't know
his last name?

945
00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:44.870
No.

946
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.671
Any of these people
look like him?

947
00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:57.870
No, who are they?

948
00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.872
Five of Giselle Hammond's
friends.

949
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.030
All deceased.

950
00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.910
Three suicides, two accidental deaths.
All in three weeks.

951
00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:09.072
And now
you've lost two friends.

952
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.952
I don't believe
in coincidences, Olivia.

953
00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:15.636
I think this is all connected.
If you know how, you need to tell me.

954
00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:17.792
No, I promise.

955
00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.551
If I did know, I would.

956
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.995
I hope so.

957
00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:30.995
We'll be in touch.

958
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.072
Don't take
any more vacations.

959
00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.590
That did not go well.

960
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.393
We told them
the truth.

961
00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.880
- As much as we could.
- Guys,

962
00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:43.679
the cops should be
the least of our concerns.

963
00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:47.959
I mean, Penelope's dead
and Giselle gave us nothing.

964
00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.510
She did say a new game
had to start at the mission.

965
00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.672
That place
has to be the key.

966
00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.035
Brad.

967
00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.069
Catch up
with you guys later.

968
00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.430
No, we shouldn't split up.

969
00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.000
No, it's okay.
My turn's not for a while.

970
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.432
I'll deal with my father,
you deal with finding the mission.

971
01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.510
Come on.

972
01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.639
I think it was built in 1896.

973
01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.157
Yeah, that really
narrows it down.

974
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.515
It's a start.

975
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.591
Oh, shit. I gotta
grab my charger.

976
01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.598
I think you left
your bag in my room.

977
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.790
- Oh, my God.
- What?

978
01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.036
Check this out.

979
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.720
It says there was a
massacre a few weeks later.

980
01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.154
Only one survivor, lives in the area.
Inez Reyes, 19.

981
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.240
Truth

982
01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.194
or dare.

983
01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.439
Where is she? Liv!

984
01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.755
Hey! Hey!

985
01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.160
Olivia! Are you okay?

986
01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.230
Where am I?

987
01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.470
- Where am I?
- What the hell are you...

988
01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.632
Hey! Hey! Hey!

989
01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.596
Are you okay?

990
01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.240
Was that your turn?

991
01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.912
Hey! Hey!
Come back! Come back!

992
01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.352
Olivia, what did he say?

993
01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.912
He dared me
to sleep with Lucas.

994
01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.952
Why would you pick dare?

995
01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.633
Because of what
Giselle said.

996
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.516
If I picked truth,

997
01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.798
I was just forcing someone
else to pick dare.

998
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.316
How noble.

999
01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.959
Markie, I didn't know
that's what it would ask.

1000
01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.596
I don't think
he knew where he was.

1001
01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.280
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, I'm perfect.

1002
01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.999
Well, hey, hey!
Where are you going?

1003
01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.116
Anywhere but here.

1004
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.435
What is going on?

1005
01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.119
Why don't you ask Olivia?

1006
01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.720
Will you please tell me
what the hell is going on?

1007
01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.510
I got my turn.

1008
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.320
Yeah, and?

1009
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.035
Whoa. Hey, no.
What are we doing?

1010
01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.553
Oh, this is the dare.

1011
01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.390
I'm sorry.

1012
01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.358
Why didn't you pick truth?

1013
01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.354
I told Markie it was so that
you guys wouldn't have to,

1014
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.593
but that was a lie.

1015
01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.640
I chose dare because there is something
that I can never tell Markie,

1016
01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.519
and I'm really afraid the
game's gonna make me do it.

1017
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.714
It can't be that bad.

1018
01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.080
You have no idea.

1019
01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.676
What?

1020
01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.153
No, you're just doing this
because of the dare.

1021
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.509
Because you have to.

1022
01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.955
No, you have to.

1023
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.160
I don't.

1024
01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.195
Look at me.

1025
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.875
Truth or dare?

1026
01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.833
Truth or dare?

1027
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.553
Truth!

1028
01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.836
Who are you
truly in love with?

1029
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.316
I care about you. I do.

1030
01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.794
I'm in love with Markie.

1031
01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.315
Liv, I'm sorry.
It was the game.

1032
01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.992
No, it was the truth.

1033
01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.911
<i>Roy Cameron, 45 years old,
attempts to make dinner.</i>

1034
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.635
<i>Take one.</i>

1035
01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.113
<i>Whoa. A little faith, please?</i>

1036
01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.317
<i>Nobody makes a steak
like your old man.</i>

1037
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.790
<i>Wait, Dad,
I'm pescatarian now.</i>

1038
01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.120
<i>I know, honey.</i>

1039
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.070
Dad?

1040
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.679
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

1041
01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.353
I miss you, too.

1042
01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:47.240
<i>There's something that
I have been dying to ask you.</i>

1043
01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.630
No.

1044
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.869
- She's not answering.
- Wait.

1045
01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.360
Come here. Look at this.

1046
01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.954
There's no number,
but she lives in Tijuana.

1047
01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.674
That's less than
three hours away.

1048
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.354
Who is she?

1049
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.512
She's someone who might
be able to help us.

1050
01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.270
Come on.

1051
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.958
<i>Come on, sweetheart.</i>

1052
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.080
<i>Time to pick.</i>

1053
01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.800
Truth.

1054
01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.352
<i>The gun I used
to kill myself,</i>

1055
01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.119
<i>why do you keep it?</i>

1056
01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.600
Sometimes I think
about using it.

1057
01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.833
<i>Maybe you should get it.</i>

1058
01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.836
I'm worried
about Markie.

1059
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.112
I wish we would have
found her before we left.

1060
01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:48.354
Well, she doesn't want to speak to me
right now, so there's nothing we can do.

1061
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.710
You know,
the secret that you're keeping from her,

1062
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.196
maybe if you got it out,
the game couldn't use it against you.

1063
01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.636
No, no one can ever know.

1064
01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.239
Especially not Markie.
It would kill her.

1065
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.471
I'll try her again
when we get there.

1066
01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.040
- Um...
- Can I help you?

1067
01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.635
Sorry. Um, we're looking
for Inez Reyes.

1068
01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.757
She's my grandmother.
I watch after her.

1069
01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.959
We were just wondering
if we could speak to her.

1070
01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.034
She speaks to no one.

1071
01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.270
No, please.

1072
01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.156
Our friends are dying, just like hers did.
We just need a few words.

1073
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.395
I will ask.

1074
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:14.600
And if you could
show her this.

1075
01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.993
Show her that
we were at this mission,

1076
01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:20.392
and that half the people
in this photo are now dead.

1077
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.438
Then maybe
she'll talk to us.

1078
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.112
She might see you.
But she will not speak to you.

1079
01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.916
She has not said a word
in 50 years.

1080
01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.835
Wait here.

1081
01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.434
She must have taken
a vow of silence, right?

1082
01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.112
She was 19 when her friends were butchered.
Imagine what that did to her.

1083
01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.035
I don't have to.

1084
01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.758
It's been over an hour.

1085
01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.952
Yeah, for someone who doesn't speak,
they seem to be doing a lot of talking.

1086
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.040
She will see you.

1087
01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.554
I'm sorry for the wait.

1088
01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.039
She has written
something for you.

1089
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:27.790
What is it?

1090
01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.837
She would not
let me read it.

1091
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.671
Thank you
for seeing us, Ms. Reyes.

1092
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.079
"The mission was a convent where
young women went to find God.

1093
01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.714
"We were girls,
so we played silly games like hide-and-seek.

1094
01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.351
"But the priest who ran the convent
forced us to play his own game.

1095
01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:12.513
"He let us hide,
but then he took the one he found.

1096
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.316
"His pleasure was our pain.

1097
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.514
"We suffered in silence.

1098
01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.000
"Then one of the girls
told a secret.

1099
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.959
"She knew spells
that could call spirits

1100
01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.919
"so she summoned
a demon named Calux.

1101
01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.958
"He possessed our game."

1102
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.430
Possessed the game?

1103
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.399
"Demons possess
people, places,

1104
01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.995
"objects, even ideas."

1105
01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.390
Uh...

1106
01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.670
"Calux is a trickster.

1107
01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.911
"That night, when the priest
found his victim,

1108
01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.351
"she was possessed by Calux.

1109
01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.115
"She hid the priest's body
in the mission

1110
01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.750
"in pieces.

1111
01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.514
"It took them a week
to find his head.

1112
01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.672
"But Calux didn't want to stop.
He made us keep playing.

1113
01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.832
"Many of my sisters died."

1114
01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.359
Wait, how did you
and the others escape?

1115
01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.320
"The person
who released the demon

1116
01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.153
"can trap it
with a simple ritual.

1117
01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.358
"But only by his own hand."

1118
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.269
Uh... This is the spell?

1119
01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.920
It's in Spanish.

1120
01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.679
"The spell must be
repeated seven times

1121
01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.319
"and a sacrifice must be placed
in a pot sealed with wax.

1122
01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.553
"As long as the pot
stays sealed in the mission,

1123
01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:08.715
"the door we opened for Calux
will also be sealed."

1124
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.437
Wait, I've seen
that pot before.

1125
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.754
Yeah.

1126
01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.991
Look. When I saw it,
it was broken,

1127
01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.720
and there was something inside
it and it smelled rotten.

1128
01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.837
"Whoever broke the pot
will have to do the same."

1129
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.110
What was it?

1130
01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.789
The sacrifice?

1131
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.271
It was you
who summoned the demon?

1132
01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.990
It's been a few years since AP Spanish,
but I think it says,

1133
01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.231
"I have called upon an evil,

1134
01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.394
"silence my voice
so the evil is no more."

1135
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.677
So when Carter and his friends
broke the pot at the mission...

1136
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.480
The demon was freed and possessed
their game of truth or dare.

1137
01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.600
And we have to find
whoever broke that pot.

1138
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.514
Giselle said somebody named
Sam trashed the place.

1139
01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:52.875
And we have no idea
who Sam is.

1140
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.190
Or if he's even still alive.

1141
01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.510
And if we do find him...

1142
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.515
What? "Hi, Sam, do you mind
cutting out your tongue

1143
01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:03.316
"and sealing it
in this lovely handmade pot?"

1144
01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.880
I'll check Giselle's Facebook again,
see if there's a Sam tagged.

1145
01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.230
Still nothing from Markie?

1146
01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.999
She's ignoring all my texts.

1147
01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.635
Her turn is next.
I'm gonna try calling her again.

1148
01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.430
Brad?

1149
01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:20.790
Brad!

1150
01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.670
It's your father.

1151
01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.036
Since Penelope,
he's been...

1152
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.600
I'll get rid of him.

1153
01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.360
Let's talk outside.

1154
01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.074
I'm gonna
grab a coffee.

1155
01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:52.790
Look, uh, I'm hearing some things
about your friend's murder.

1156
01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.994
Kranis in homicide isn't
convinced it's so simple.

1157
01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.795
I know I don't
need to ask this, but...

1158
01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.880
Is there something
you're not telling us?

1159
01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:05.192
No, I promise.
Everything we told you was true.

1160
01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.590
Markie, thank God!

1161
01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.034
Why are you telling me
all this?

1162
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.032
'Cause I know
Kranis is wrong,

1163
01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.993
and I want you
to know what's going on.

1164
01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.276
You don't have to worry.

1165
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.511
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

1166
01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.073
You're still my son, Brad.

1167
01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.315
You gonna get that?

1168
01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.159
Get what?

1169
01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.518
<i>Truth or dare, Brad?</i>

1170
01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.319
<i>Yeah,
I guess I just needed some time alone.</i>

1171
01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.675
No, no, no. It's fine.

1172
01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:42.071
Just get here as fast as you can.
And please be careful.

1173
01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.270
Your turn's next.

1174
01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.350
<i>I had my turn.</i>

1175
01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.876
<i>I chose truth.</i>

1176
01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:46.996
So did Lucas.

1177
01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.997
And if the both of you
picked truth...

1178
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.470
<i>You only have
one choice.</i>

1179
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.313
You sure there's nothing
you need to tell me?

1180
01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.471
<i>I dare you to steal his gun</i>

1181
01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.200
<i>and make him beg for his life.</i>

1182
01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.110
Son?

1183
01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.754
Thank you, Dad,

1184
01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.509
for everything.

1185
01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.476
It's just, uh...

1186
01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.919
There's just one more thing I need to do,
and I hope you can forgive me.

1187
01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.874
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Of course.

1188
01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.679
For what?

1189
01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.069
It's okay.

1190
01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.080
I need you to beg.

1191
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.833
- For your life.
- The hell are you doing?

1192
01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.315
Beg for your life!

1193
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.472
Brad, please
put the gun down!

1194
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.676
- Just do as I say...
- You don't have to do this.

1195
01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:36.989
or I'll die.
Get on your knees.

1196
01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.435
We have to go. Now!

1197
01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.719
Do as I say.
I'll explain everything, okay?

1198
01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.037
- I know I've been hard on you. I'm sorry.
- Listen. No!

1199
01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.475
That's not
what this is about.

1200
01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.157
Beg! Please, I'll explain
everything. Just beg.

1201
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.754
I guess you think
I deserve this.

1202
01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.559
No! No.

1203
01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.279
Just beg!

1204
01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.752
Please! Just beg
and I'll put down the gun.

1205
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.434
- What's that gonna prove, Brad?
- Just beg!

1206
01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.239
And I'll put down
the gun! Beg!

1207
01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.839
No, no! No!

1208
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.510
Brad!

1209
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.432
Brad, no, no, no. No!

1210
01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.196
No! No!

1211
01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.476
Get a paramedic.

1212
01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.110
Come on.

1213
01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.596
Brad! Brad! No, no, no.

1214
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.240
Stay here.
You're gonna be fine.

1215
01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.357
No! No!

1216
01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.751
I need a paramedic. Help!

1217
01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.316
I need a paramedic! Brad!

1218
01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.560
I'm so sorry.

1219
01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.469
Guys, can we
get out of here?

1220
01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.631
I still need to
talk to the detective.

1221
01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.911
I shouldn't have picked truth.
No.

1222
01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.912
It's not your fault.
I picked truth, too.

1223
01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.430
We shouldn't have
left Brad alone.

1224
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.478
No, it wouldn't
have mattered.

1225
01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.394
This game is smart. It's too smart.
We're not playing it.

1226
01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.029
It's playing us.
And none of this is a coincidence.

1227
01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.840
It waits for our most vulnerable
moments and that's when it asks us.

1228
01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.476
Yeah, you got that right,
Olivia.

1229
01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.153
And now it's your turn.

1230
01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:23.991
Truth or dare?

1231
01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.515
What?

1232
01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.549
What is it?

1233
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.079
Lucas just asked me.

1234
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.350
No, I didn't.

1235
01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.669
Truth or dare, Olivia?

1236
01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.070
Okay.

1237
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.432
Okay, you have to
pick truth.

1238
01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.150
Olivia, do it.

1239
01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.356
- Dare.
- Olivia.

1240
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.955
I dare you

1241
01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.072
to tell Markie the secret
you fear most.

1242
01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.240
What? What is it
making you do?

1243
01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.236
Markie, there's something
important I need to tell you.

1244
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.790
What?

1245
01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:17.272
I was there the night your dad died.
I know what happened.

1246
01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.150
What?

1247
01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.474
What are you talking about?

1248
01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:27.112
I had gotten into a fight with my parents,
so I went to your house.

1249
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.072
You weren't there,
so your dad let me in.

1250
01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.960
He was drinking,
and he offered me one, so I took it.

1251
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.718
We had a few, and then he told me
that he had been fired that day

1252
01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:43.190
'cause he was
drinking on the job.

1253
01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.756
I felt really bad for him.

1254
01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:50.995
But I told him that you and I
would help him figure things out.

1255
01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.353
And then
he called me beautiful.

1256
01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.591
I was drunk, and I didn't know what to do,
and then he leaned in to kiss me...

1257
01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.593
I tried to push him off.
I didn't do it, but he...

1258
01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.913
He kept
coming back stronger.

1259
01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.197
Finally, I got free.

1260
01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.117
He begged me
to forgive him.

1261
01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.317
Said that he needed help,
but I was so scared.

1262
01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.432
And I was confused,

1263
01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.273
and I threatened to
tell you what happened,

1264
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.631
but he said that he would die
if you ever found out.

1265
01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.798
I told him that you'd be
better off if he were dead.

1266
01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:41.154
Markie,
I am so sorry.

1267
01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.912
I wanted to tell you,
but by the time I got a hold of you,

1268
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.595
he had already done it
and you were devastated.

1269
01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.878
It broke my heart.
I didn't know what to do. Trust me...

1270
01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:51.950
No.

1271
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.754
No, I'll never
trust you again.

1272
01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.830
Markie.

1273
01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.070
Don't!

1274
01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.230
Don't.

1275
01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.760
Miss Barron,

1276
01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:02.830
you're up.

1277
01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.150
"I know the game dared you
to set that woman on fire.

1278
01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.432
"Tell me where to meet you,
or I'll wait outside your family's house

1279
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.595
"until the game dares me
to do the same to them."

1280
01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.831
That is quite a threat.

1281
01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.191
We traced the IP
to your laptop.

1282
01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.478
I know that
that looks bad,

1283
01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.075
but I just needed
to get her attention.

1284
01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.117
Yeah, I know you're playing some
kind of truth or dare game,

1285
01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.478
but what I don't understand is,
why are people dying?

1286
01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.596
There's only
four of you left.

1287
01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.751
I'd like to keep
the rest of you guys alive.

1288
01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:36.876
Four?

1289
01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.360
Everyone who's dead
was in Mexico.

1290
01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:42.036
That leaves you, Markie and Lucas,
and Giselle's friend, Sam Meehan.

1291
01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.474
Sam?

1292
01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.119
Wait, he's alive?

1293
01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.953
You know him?

1294
01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.995
No.

1295
01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.156
No.

1296
01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.351
That's just someone that
Giselle had mentioned.

1297
01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:01.429
He's holed up in an apartment.
Won't talk to anybody.

1298
01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.798
Said I had to arrest him if I
wanted to speak to him again.

1299
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.754
Olivia, what the hell
is happening here?

1300
01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.758
Could I get
some water, please?

1301
01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.079
Thanks.

1302
01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.389
I need
a glass of water.

1303
01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.597
Yes, sir, right away.

1304
01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.999
Am I being charged?

1305
01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.040
Not yet.

1306
01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.874
Okay. Then I need to go.

1307
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.839
Carter is Sam.

1308
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.753
He was using a fake name.

1309
01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.478
But Giselle acted like
they were different people?

1310
01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:30.994
Well, she was probably
trying to protect him,

1311
01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.039
but she slipped up,
and she used his real name. Come on.

1312
01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.914
Markie?

1313
01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.590
Markie?

1314
01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.710
Markie!

1315
01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.199
Markie, please open the door.
We need to talk.

1316
01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.398
What are you doing?

1317
01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.440
What my father did.

1318
01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.990
Markie, please put it down.

1319
01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:49.316
Why?

1320
01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.555
I don't have anything.

1321
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.920
You have me.

1322
01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.590
No.

1323
01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.111
No, the game has us.

1324
01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:03.352
I hid the truth about
your dad to protect you.

1325
01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.119
But I was wrong.

1326
01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.631
Every single day,
I wish I could take back what I said to him.

1327
01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.478
He tried before.

1328
01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.593
It's not your fault.

1329
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.269
We can't change the past.

1330
01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.751
But we can still have a future.
We can end this game.

1331
01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.240
How?

1332
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.275
Carter. I know
where he is.

1333
01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:55.149
Okay, so what's the plan?

1334
01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.152
We just have to get him
back to the mission.

1335
01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:00.677
Okay, so don't open with,
"We need you to cut out your own tongue"?

1336
01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.752
Here it is. Six.

1337
01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.078
Go away.
I don't wanna talk to anyone.

1338
01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.270
Screw this.

1339
01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.273
- You...
- Carter!

1340
01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.709
Or is it Sam?

1341
01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.872
- How did you find me?
- We were motivated.

1342
01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.033
- What the hell happened in here?
- The game.

1343
01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.353
No contact with the outside.

1344
01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.556
Nothing in here
can hurt me.

1345
01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.554
This is your plan?

1346
01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:24.949
My plan is to wait it out.

1347
01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.873
No, that was
your second plan.

1348
01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.158
Your first plan
was to screw us.

1349
01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.710
Three of my best friends
are dead because of you!

1350
01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.873
I'm sorry. I lost friends,
too, okay?

1351
01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.190
If I could take it
all back, I would.

1352
01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.270
There is a way.

1353
01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.799
But we all have to
go back to the mission.

1354
01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:41.919
A way to what? To what,
end the game? How?

1355
01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:44.390
Just trust me.

1356
01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:45.789
We have to go back.

1357
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.200
No...

1358
01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.238
This is another dare, right?

1359
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.754
The game is daring you
to lure me out.

1360
01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:54.830
- Is that...
- No.

1361
01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.353
She's telling the truth.

1362
01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.510
And why should I
trust you?

1363
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.956
Because we want
the same thing.

1364
01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.270
We wanna survive.

1365
01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.153
Look...

1366
01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.114
I'm gonna tell you what you
should have told me at the bar.

1367
01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.000
Piss off.

1368
01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:21.838
Okay, sweet, little Olivia's
not shooting anyone.

1369
01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.152
Try me. I dare you.

1370
01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:34.910
Let's go.

1371
01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.120
Is this ritual that old nun told
you about actually gonna work?

1372
01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.278
There's only one way
to find out.

1373
01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.919
So we're gonna end this
with a séance?

1374
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.275
We are
not ending it.

1375
01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.715
You are.

1376
01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.030
Me?

1377
01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.350
I tried.

1378
01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.716
We all know
how that turned out.

1379
01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.471
Stay down.

1380
01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.392
Here, take this. Take it.

1381
01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.310
Say it seven times.

1382
01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.110
What are you gonna
do with that?

1383
01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.034
I'm giving it to you.

1384
01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.873
Take it now!

1385
01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.160
Now say the words
seven times.

1386
01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:49.670
Go!

1387
01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:58.830
Did you feel that?

1388
01:29:59.000 --> 01:29:59.990
Don't stop.

1389
01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.998
- Just tell me what's going on!
- Keep going!

1390
01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.556
All right. Uh...

1391
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.076
Say it again.

1392
01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:23.190
Five more times.

1393
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.035
Truth or dare, Lucas?

1394
01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:37.830
Dare.

1395
01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.953
- Where are you going?
- Just gotta get away from here.

1396
01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.156
Wait, wait, wait!

1397
01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.391
You can't go.
Your turn's next.

1398
01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.150
I just had my turn.

1399
01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:55.513
- Gotta get away from you both.
- Why?

1400
01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:57.276
Because it dared me
to choose.

1401
01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.079
You already have.
You love Markie!

1402
01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.833
Choose which one
of you to kill.

1403
01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.560
Luke.

1404
01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:08.836
What, so he's just leaving?

1405
01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:11.037
Don't stop.
Two more times.

1406
01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:16.430
Luke!

1407
01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:17.795
Luke!

1408
01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:19.314
Why did you pick dare?

1409
01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.875
Because I knew if I didn't,
then one of you would have to.

1410
01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.040
And we're so close.

1411
01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:25.915
And I won't let
the game kill you.

1412
01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.034
You're such an idiot.

1413
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:30.989
What can I say?

1414
01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.679
You do that to me.

1415
01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.269
That's seven. We gotta
get out of here.

1416
01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:57.350
This place
is coming down.

1417
01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.715
No, there's
one more thing to do.

1418
01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:00.954
Pick up the knife.

1419
01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:02.829
I can't do it for you.

1420
01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:05.390
Pick it up!

1421
01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.270
And do what?

1422
01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.471
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1423
01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:14.835
But you unleashed
this evil,

1424
01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.480
which means you're the
only one who can stop it.

1425
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.838
I need you
to cut out your tongue.

1426
01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:24.395
No! That's insane.

1427
01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.557
Please! It's the only way
we survive.

1428
01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.356
You take care of each other.

1429
01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.596
No!

1430
01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.190
No. No, no, no.

1431
01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.230
No, no!

1432
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.629
Do it.

1433
01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.510
No!

1434
01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:00.950
Lucas, stop!

1435
01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:02.315
That's not Lucas.

1436
01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.110
Do it now, Carter!

1437
01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:06.792
Before it's too late.

1438
01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.030
Don't you wanna live?

1439
01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.189
You do not have a choice!
Do it!

1440
01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.512
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

1441
01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:24.035
I will murder everyone
you've ever known.

1442
01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.755
No! They are not in this.
It's just us!

1443
01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.639
You're right. But Lucas is.

1444
01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:31.439
And he didn't do his dare.

1445
01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:32.790
So now he dies.

1446
01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:35.710
No...

1447
01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.152
Lucas refused his dare
to save us.

1448
01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.634
We have to finish this.

1449
01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:30.360
Calux killed Carter.
The spell won't work.

1450
01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:34.554
No, we lost the second
we started this game.

1451
01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.392
The second we came here.

1452
01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.155
Carter was dared
to bring us here,

1453
01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.391
because this is where you can
add new people to the game.

1454
01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.470
I have an idea.

1455
01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.396
Your turn's next.
When you're asked, I need you to pick dare.

1456
01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.110
Why would I do that?

1457
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.430
Markie...

1458
01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.476
Truth or dare?

1459
01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.638
Now Lucas is asking me.

1460
01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:00.995
Pick dare.

1461
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.796
But don't do it.

1462
01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:03.916
What? I'll die!

1463
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.320
Markie...

1464
01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.871
I am so sorry for keeping that
secret from you for so long.

1465
01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.999
And I swear to you I will never
ever keep anything from you again.

1466
01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.800
But we survive this
only if we trust each other.

1467
01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:15.916
Okay?

1468
01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:19.750
Okay.

1469
01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:20.910
Trust me.

1470
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.840
You have to pick.

1471
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.590
Dare.

1472
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.477
I dare you to shoot Olivia.

1473
01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:30.994
He wants me to shoot you.

1474
01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.759
You gotta trust me, Markie.
Don't do it.

1475
01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.559
This is the only way
to save us both.

1476
01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:35.830
Okay.

1477
01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:37.800
I trust you.

1478
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:42.875
I won't do it.

1479
01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:49.670
No!

1480
01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:55.120
Dare complete, Calux.

1481
01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:57.790
Your turn.

1482
01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.670
Truth or dare?

1483
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.596
I'm not in this game.

1484
01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.796
No, once you're asked,
you're in.

1485
01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.473
Those are the rules,
right?

1486
01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.479
So, truth or dare,
asshole?

1487
01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.110
Truth.

1488
01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:13.035
How do we get out
of this game alive?

1489
01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:16.835
You can't.

1490
01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:20.030
Carter was the only one
who could stop this.

1491
01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:24.160
So, now the game won't end
until all the players are dead.

1492
01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:26.553
And your turn's next.

1493
01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.278
Unless you find some
new friends to play with.

1494
01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.474
But that's not
gonna happen, is it?

1495
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:39.915
Your arm.

1496
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:40.990
I'm okay.

1497
01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:42.958
Well, did it work?

1498
01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.357
It's not over.

1499
01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.794
The game will never end.
Not as long as we're alive.

1500
01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:52.674
What are you doing?

1501
01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:55.679
I'm choosing you.

1502
01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.959
<i>My friends
and I went on a trip</i>

1503
01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.759
<i>to Mexico for spring break.</i>

1504
01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:19.111
<i>We ended up in an old mission where
we played a game of truth or dare.</i>

1505
01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:25.832
<i>We had no idea that we had
encountered an unspeakable evil</i>

1506
01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.513
<i>that wanted to play with us.</i>

1507
01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:30.997
<i>When we went home,
the game kept going.</i>

1508
01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.199
<i>It killed five of my friends.</i>

1509
01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.674
<i>The game is real.</i>

1510
01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.275
<i>Tell the truth,
do the dare or you die.</i>

1511
01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.794
<i>Refuse to play, you die.</i>

1512
01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:40.996
<i>It can happen anywhere.</i>

1513
01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.356
<i>And it can come from anyone.</i>

1514
01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.195
<i>I'm so sorry,
but I have to ask you.</i>

1515
01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:49.510
<i>Truth or dare?</i>

1516
01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:24.554
<i>Truth or dare?</i>
