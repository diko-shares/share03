00:03:17.862 --> 00:03:19.241
Hey, watch it.

2
00:03:34.254 --> 00:03:36.446
Oh, come on.

3
00:03:44.278 --> 00:03:45.948
Hey, Mike!

4
00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:48.767
-Hey, Larry.
-How you doing?

5
00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:50.124
Have you seen Nicky?

6
00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:52.839
I'm pretty sure he went with Erica.
It was half day today.

7
00:03:53.048 --> 00:03:55.240
Parent Career Day.

8
00:04:01.087 --> 00:04:03.593
-Hey.
-Hey. Come on in.

9
00:04:04.846 --> 00:04:07.873
-You all right?
-Yeah, yeah.

10
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:10.275
Why didn't anybody tell me
it was Career Day?

11
00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:12.991
What do you mean?
Nicky said he was gonna tell you.

12
00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.749
Oh, okay, I guess he forgot.

13
00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.255
There he is. How are you, Larry?

14
00:04:19.463 --> 00:04:21.447
Good. How are you doing, Don?

15
00:04:22.282 --> 00:04:23.744
Good.

16
00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:26.667
Can you believe this weather?

17
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.618
Chilly, right? Chilly, chilly,
Chilly Willy the penguin.

18
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:38.152
Leave me alone. Hey, why don't I go tell
the little corncob you're here.

19
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:41.493
Great. Great, that's great.
Yeah, thanks.

20
00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.296
Wow, your fiance really manages
to squeeze a lot onto that belt.

21
00:04:46.504 --> 00:04:47.862
-Stop it.
-What?

22
00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:50.995
What? No, it's like he's...

23
00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.770
...the Batman of stockbrokers.

24
00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.902
-Bond trader.
-Bond trader. Sorry.

25
00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:00.496
Hey, how's it going with that virtual-reality
driving range that you wanted to open?

26
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.732
Getting there, still waiting for
the technology to catch up.

27
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:06.134
It's not easy,
there are a lot of moving parts.

28
00:05:07.387 --> 00:05:10.728
Hey, do you think Nick
would like Queens?

29
00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:14.592
Oh, no, Larry.
You didn't get evicted again, did you?

30
00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:16.679
I didn't...

31
00:05:16.887 --> 00:05:19.811
...get evicted. I didn't get evicted, no.
I mean, I didn't....

32
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.047
-No, I didn't get evicted yet. It's like--
-Larry, listen to me.

33
00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:25.136
I don't know how much more
Nicky can take.

34
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.955
Every couple months, it's a new career,
a new apartment.

35
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.401
If it wasn't for Nicky, I wouldn't
say anything, I would stay out of it.

36
00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:34.220
It's just, it's too much instability.
It's not good for him.

37
00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:37.018
I'm trying to figure things out
right now, okay?

38
00:05:41.737 --> 00:05:43.199
You know...

39
00:05:44.053 --> 00:05:46.853
...I don't think that Nicky
should stay with you.

40
00:05:47.062 --> 00:05:50.611
-What?
-Just until you get really settled.

41
00:05:51.446 --> 00:05:53.096
Hey, Dad.

42
00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:56.290
-Hey, ready to carve it up?
-Cool.

43
00:06:01.262 --> 00:06:04.916
All right, good!
Take it, Nicky! Break away!

44
00:06:09.197 --> 00:06:11.702
-What are you doing?
-Hey, Nicky! Are you all right?

45
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.192
-You okay?
-I'm fine. Would you get off the ice?

46
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:18.802
Listen. Their left defenseman
is a very weak skater.

47
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.830
So you go left side, you got
a clear shot at the goal. Okay?

48
00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.231
-Cool, thanks.
-All right, man.

49
00:06:24.962 --> 00:06:29.951
We're good here. We're good.
All right. As you were, skaters.

50
00:06:30.263 --> 00:06:31.282
Game on!

51
00:06:33.732 --> 00:06:34.996
I'm good.

52
00:06:34.997 --> 00:06:37.505
I'm telling you,
you tore it up out there today.

53
00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:40.115
Thinking the NHL
is a serious possibility.

54
00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:43.665
I don't really wanna be
a hockey player anymore.

55
00:06:45.635 --> 00:06:49.289
-All right. What do you wanna be?
-A bond trader.

56
00:06:49.747 --> 00:06:51.378
A bond trader?

57
00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:55.449
Yeah, it's what Don does.
He took me to his office last week.

58
00:06:56.285 --> 00:06:57.642
That's cool.

59
00:06:57.746 --> 00:07:00.461
So you wanna dress up
in a monkey suit and tie every day?

60
00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:03.489
Like an automaton robot?

61
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:07.352
Trust me, you can't play hockey
in a cubicle. Kind of awkward.

62
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:09.857
Well, he's got a pretty big office.

63
00:07:10.274 --> 00:07:12.990
That's not the point.
Come on, you love hockey.

64
00:07:13.094 --> 00:07:16.227
I still like it,
but bond trading's my fallback.

65
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.211
Your fallback?

66
00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:21.134
Wait a minute. You're too young
to have a fallback, okay?

67
00:07:21.343 --> 00:07:24.266
And also, where did you ever
even hear that word?

68
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:27.503
Mom was talking to Don
about all your different schemes.

69
00:07:27.607 --> 00:07:28.965
She called them schemes?

70
00:07:29.173 --> 00:07:32.097
She said it was time
you found a fallback.

71
00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:37.735
Are you really moving again?

72
00:07:40.867 --> 00:07:43.164
I don't know. We'll see. I mean...

73
00:07:43.268 --> 00:07:45.774
...there's some pretty cool places
out in Queens.

74
00:07:45.878 --> 00:07:48.488
-Yeah.
-Hey.

75
00:07:48.697 --> 00:07:51.413
Hey, Nicky, look at me.

76
00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:53.823
Look at me, man.
I wanna tell you something.

77
00:07:54.032 --> 00:07:57.268
I know that things have been kind of
up and down for me lately...

78
00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.252
...and that's been hard for you.

79
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.280
But I really feel like my moment's coming
and when it does...

80
00:08:02.489 --> 00:08:05.516
...everything's just gonna come together,
you know?

81
00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:06.978
What if you're wrong...

82
00:08:07.082 --> 00:08:10.737
...and you're just an ordinary guy
who should get a job?

83
00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:18.776
All right, well....

84
00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:24.101
You know what,
we'll figure it out, okay?

85
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.278
All right? Come on,
let's get you back to Mom's.

86
00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:38.532
Mr. Daley, I can honestly say,
in 43 years at this agency...

87
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.455
...I've never seen a resume
quite like yours.

88
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:43.752
All right.

89
00:08:45.214 --> 00:08:47.510
That wasn't a compliment.

90
00:08:48.137 --> 00:08:50.016
It says here you were the CEO...

91
00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:52.731
...of Snaptime lndustries.

92
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.401
Care to elaborate on that?

93
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.517
Sure. Well, that was the umbrella
corporation for my invention, the Snapper.

94
00:08:59.726 --> 00:09:03.277
You know, you snap, the lights come on.
Snap, they come off.

95
00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:06.096
Didn't they already make that?

96
00:09:07.349 --> 00:09:11.003
No, no, that's the Clapper,
which, obviously...

97
00:09:11.212 --> 00:09:12.778
...stole a bit of our thunder.

98
00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:16.432
Personally, I don't really see
what the big difference is, I mean:

99
00:09:16.536 --> 00:09:18.938
You know, whatever, but...

100
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.625
...apparently there is a significant portion
of the population that has trouble actually...

101
00:09:24.833 --> 00:09:27.903
-...snapping.
-Clapping's easier.

102
00:09:29.051 --> 00:09:30.827
Debatable.

103
00:09:31.224 --> 00:09:33.209
I can't help you.

104
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.103
Debbie?

105
00:09:35.312 --> 00:09:36.982
Can I call you Debbie? Because...

106
00:09:37.191 --> 00:09:39.489
...I felt a connection
when I entered this office...

107
00:09:39.698 --> 00:09:41.995
...and I don't know,
I feel like you did too.

108
00:09:42.334 --> 00:09:44.527
I didn't feel a connection.

109
00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:48.694
Look.

110
00:09:50.043 --> 00:09:53.801
I need a job tomorrow, okay?

111
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.889
If I don't have one....

112
00:09:56.516 --> 00:09:58.813
Well, I just need it, okay?

113
00:09:59.126 --> 00:10:01.318
Well, I don't know.

114
00:10:01.632 --> 00:10:03.929
I might have one thing.

115
00:10:04.346 --> 00:10:08.627
They've turned down everyone
I've sent over there, but--

116
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:10.297
Great.

117
00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:12.490
--who knows?

118
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.414
You might get lucky.

119
00:10:49.142 --> 00:10:51.753
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hi.

120
00:10:51.962 --> 00:10:56.555
I'm Larry Daley. I've got a job interview
with Cecil Fredricks.

121
00:10:57.077 --> 00:11:00.210
-Right. He should still be in his office.
-Great.

122
00:11:00.418 --> 00:11:03.864
-I'm Rebecca Hutman. I'm a docent here.
-Hi.

123
00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:07.309
-Let me point you in the right direction.
-Great.

124
00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:10.859
Teddy Roosevelt, right?

125
00:11:11.068 --> 00:11:14.722
-Yes, a great visionary.
-Yes, definitely.

126
00:11:14.826 --> 00:11:16.915
He was our 4th president, right?

127
00:11:17.123 --> 00:11:19.316
-Twenty-sixth.
-Twenty-sixth.

128
00:11:19.525 --> 00:11:22.448
Please don't touch the exhibits!
I mean....

129
00:11:22.657 --> 00:11:24.014
Riffraff.

130
00:11:24.432 --> 00:11:27.461
Miss Hutman.
I cannot tolerate this type of chaos.

131
00:11:27.565 --> 00:11:30.802
I mean, this is a museum, not a....

132
00:11:32.263 --> 00:11:34.142
Do you know what "museum" means?

133
00:11:35.082 --> 00:11:38.841
It doesn't mean,
"Daddy, it's a big Tyrannosaurus thing.

134
00:11:38.945 --> 00:11:41.555
Can I touch its leg? " No!

135
00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:43.748
Work it out, please.

136
00:11:43.852 --> 00:11:46.671
-Will do, sir.
-Thank you.

137
00:11:47.193 --> 00:11:49.281
Dr. McPhee, the museum director.

138
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.265
Seems like a fun guy.

139
00:11:51.274 --> 00:11:54.302
Control your young, please. Can we?

140
00:12:05.996 --> 00:12:09.128
Hello? Just kidding.

141
00:12:09.337 --> 00:12:12.991
Hi. I'm Larry Daley.
Are you Mr. Fredricks?

142
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.288
Mr. Fredricks was my father.

143
00:12:15.497 --> 00:12:18.838
I am Cecil. Good to meet you, Larry.
Nice firm handshake.

144
00:12:19.047 --> 00:12:22.492
I like that. Tells a lot about a man.
Come on in.

145
00:12:26.877 --> 00:12:29.801
Let's talk turkey here.

146
00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:35.334
The museum is losing money,
hand over fist.

147
00:12:35.543 --> 00:12:39.824
I guess kids today don't care about
wax figures or stuffed animals.

148
00:12:40.242 --> 00:12:44.001
So they're downsizing,
which is code for firing...

149
00:12:44.209 --> 00:12:46.089
...myself and the other two night guards.

150
00:12:46.506 --> 00:12:48.595
They want to replace us
with one new guard.

151
00:12:48.803 --> 00:12:52.353
-Oh, sorry.
-Well, what are you gonna do?

152
00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:56.007
I'd like you to meet
my two colleagues here.

153
00:12:56.216 --> 00:12:58.617
Reginald? Gus?

154
00:12:58.826 --> 00:13:01.436
Where is he? I'll beat him with my fist!

155
00:13:03.316 --> 00:13:06.866
Gus, this is Larry Daley, the kid who
wants to be the new night guard.

156
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.580
Night guard?

157
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.921
No, the lady at the agency said
this was a museum position.

158
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.263
Most important position
in the museum, Larry.

159
00:13:16.367 --> 00:13:18.247
He looks like a weirdie.

160
00:13:18.978 --> 00:13:21.379
Wonderful guard, terrible people skills.

161
00:13:21.588 --> 00:13:24.929
Now, listen, lunch box.
Don't try anything funny.

162
00:13:25.033 --> 00:13:28.270
I once went nine rounds
with John L. Sullivan.

163
00:13:28.478 --> 00:13:31.193
You never fought John L. Sullivan
in your life.

164
00:13:31.402 --> 00:13:34.012
Gentlemen, we have
a job candidate here.

165
00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:36.727
He's got an excellent resume,
a winning attitude...

166
00:13:36.935 --> 00:13:39.232
...and I say let's give him a shot.
What do you say?

167
00:13:39.441 --> 00:13:43.513
Hang on a sec. I think I might wanna
have a little time just to think it over.

168
00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:46.958
Do you want the job or not, snack shack?

169
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.224
-No, no, I want the job--
-Welcome to the night guards, Larry.

170
00:13:54.163 --> 00:13:56.251
Larry, meet me up on the second floor.

171
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.219
I'll slip into my orthopedics and
give you a little tour. Arthritic knees.

172
00:14:00.636 --> 00:14:04.395
Not fun getting old, my friend. Go on.

173
00:14:10.346 --> 00:14:12.747
You really think he's the one?

174
00:14:14.209 --> 00:14:15.880
Oh, yes.

175
00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:17.968
He's the one.

176
00:14:31.228 --> 00:14:35.196
Gotta keep it moving, Larry.
I'm pretty spry for an old man.

177
00:14:35.405 --> 00:14:38.537
This is the Diorama Room.

178
00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:40.729
Oh, yeah.

179
00:14:41.147 --> 00:14:45.949
I remember these little guys. Cute.

180
00:14:48.246 --> 00:14:50.230
Cecil!

181
00:14:53.049 --> 00:14:55.137
Hey, Cecil!

182
00:15:08.293 --> 00:15:10.903
-Did I get you good?
-Yeah.

183
00:15:11.008 --> 00:15:13.409
You got me.

184
00:15:16.646 --> 00:15:21.866
Seriously, though, no fooling around
in here. This stuff is really old.

185
00:15:22.075 --> 00:15:27.086
All right, then. As you can see,
it's pretty quiet in here these days.

186
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.949
On the left there is your Attila the Hun.

187
00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:35.439
And here we have our Easter lsland head.

188
00:15:37.109 --> 00:15:38.884
Hey, Cecil.

189
00:15:40.869 --> 00:15:45.463
And this, of course,
is the Hall of African Mammals.

190
00:15:45.567 --> 00:15:47.968
Ah, yes.

191
00:15:48.908 --> 00:15:52.458
Monkeys. I love monkeys.

192
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.590
-Yeah.
-Guy's cute.

193
00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:59.557
Yeah, we call him Dexter.
He's quite a little...

194
00:15:59.766 --> 00:16:02.481
...ball of fun, aren't you, Dexter?

195
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:06.866
Moving on.

196
00:16:09.058 --> 00:16:13.861
And, finally, this is the temple
of the Pharaoh Ahkmenrah.

197
00:16:16.158 --> 00:16:20.857
And in that tomb right down there,
the pharaoh himself.

198
00:16:21.066 --> 00:16:22.319
Neat.

199
00:16:22.528 --> 00:16:24.720
And hanging on the wall behind him...

200
00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:30.148
...was his most prized possession,
the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

201
00:16:30.371 --> 00:16:33.817
Twenty-four-carat gold.
It's worth a fortune.

202
00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:35.696
Very cool.

203
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.471
It is indeed, Larry.

204
00:16:38.515 --> 00:16:40.499
Very cool.

205
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:48.747
All right. Report here at 5 tomorrow.
We'll walk you through your duties.

206
00:16:48.956 --> 00:16:50.730
Okay, 5. I'll be here.

207
00:16:50.939 --> 00:16:52.819
Moving on.

208
00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:57.413
Hey, it's me. So I got a job.

209
00:16:57.622 --> 00:16:59.919
Larry, that's great. What is it?

210
00:17:00.128 --> 00:17:03.260
It's a job...

211
00:17:03.469 --> 00:17:06.706
...at the Museum of Natural History.

212
00:17:06.914 --> 00:17:09.524
Yeah, so you can tell Nicky
that we won't be moving.

213
00:17:09.733 --> 00:17:10.882
Larry, this is good news.

214
00:17:11.091 --> 00:17:13.805
Yeah, no, definitely.
So I'll see you tomorrow?

215
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.415
-Okay.
-Okay, bye.

216
00:17:25.812 --> 00:17:27.169
Larry?

217
00:17:27.587 --> 00:17:30.302
Your keys. Your torch.

218
00:17:30.511 --> 00:17:33.330
-Right.
-You'll wanna strap those to your belt.

219
00:17:33.434 --> 00:17:35.731
It can get a little spooky
around here at night...

220
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.341
...so you might wanna
put a few lights on.

221
00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:42.413
All right, flashlight, keys.
What am I for--?

222
00:17:45.128 --> 00:17:47.007
The instruction manual.

223
00:17:47.112 --> 00:17:48.364
Instructions.

224
00:17:48.573 --> 00:17:51.810
You start with one, two, three....

225
00:17:52.019 --> 00:17:53.376
Four?

226
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.255
Are you cracking wise?

227
00:17:55.464 --> 00:17:58.387
I ought to punch you
in the nose, hopscotch.

228
00:17:58.596 --> 00:18:01.519
Leave him alone, Gus.
You got it covered, right, Larry?

229
00:18:01.728 --> 00:18:03.816
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

230
00:18:04.025 --> 00:18:06.428
-You better get it!
-Gus.

231
00:18:06.636 --> 00:18:10.082
Larry, do them in order,
do them all and do them quick.

232
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:15.511
And the most important thing of all
to remember: Don't let anything in or out.

233
00:18:15.615 --> 00:18:16.868
Out?

234
00:18:17.077 --> 00:18:18.747
Good luck, son.

235
00:18:18.956 --> 00:18:21.880
-Night, Gus.
-Young buck. Cracking wise.

236
00:18:21.984 --> 00:18:23.654
Moving on.

237
00:18:58.231 --> 00:18:59.797
Hello?

238
00:18:59.902 --> 00:19:01.781
Hello!

239
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.660
Check!

240
00:19:03.869 --> 00:19:06.479
Check.

241
00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:10.238
I am Larry.

242
00:19:10.342 --> 00:19:14.414
Check! Larry! Larry.

243
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.141
Monday! Monday! Monday!

244
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.960
Monster Truck Rally.

245
00:20:45.981 --> 00:20:47.756
Cecil?

246
00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:53.707
Okay, very funny, Cecil!

247
00:20:55.169 --> 00:20:58.196
What is this, like a
David Copperfield thing?

248
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.638
This is weird.

249
00:21:17.304 --> 00:21:19.079
Cecil?

250
00:22:08.881 --> 00:22:13.475
Come on. Revolve. Revolve!

251
00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.346
-Name, please?
-Cecil...

252
00:22:29.972 --> 00:22:33.313
-...Fredricks!
-One moment. Connecting.

253
00:22:33.522 --> 00:22:35.610
-Hello.
-Cecil! It's Larry Daley!

254
00:22:35.819 --> 00:22:37.802
Larry. Yes, how can I help you?

255
00:22:37.907 --> 00:22:40.621
The dinosaur-- The dinosaur is alive!

256
00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.918
I'm having a little trouble
hearing you, friend.

257
00:22:43.023 --> 00:22:44.380
Tequila.

258
00:22:44.484 --> 00:22:46.364
The dinosaur's alive!

259
00:22:46.468 --> 00:22:47.930
What do I do?
Tell me what to do!

260
00:22:48.139 --> 00:22:51.271
Read the instructions.
It explains everything.

261
00:22:53.254 --> 00:22:54.925
Okay, I got them!

262
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.058
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Wait! What--?

263
00:23:07.663 --> 00:23:09.334
What bone?

264
00:24:06.976 --> 00:24:08.752
Fetch?

265
00:24:12.301 --> 00:24:14.076
Play fetch?

266
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.029
No way.

267
00:24:49.793 --> 00:24:51.359
-Dum-dum.
-Yes?

268
00:24:51.668 --> 00:24:54.695
-You give me gum-gum.
-I give you gum-gum?

269
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.828
You new dum-dum.
You give me gum-gum.

270
00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:01.691
Okay, you know what?
I have no gum-gum. Sorry.

271
00:25:01.899 --> 00:25:03.779
And my name isn't dum-dum,
my name's Larry.

272
00:25:03.883 --> 00:25:06.493
No, your name dum-dum.

273
00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:10.774
Oh, you in trouble, dum-dum.

274
00:25:10.983 --> 00:25:13.802
You'd better run-run
from Attila the Hun-Hun.

275
00:25:17.978 --> 00:25:19.648
See you later, dum-dum.

276
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:57.758
What is happening?

277
00:26:37.547 --> 00:26:38.800
Hey.

278
00:26:40.053 --> 00:26:41.514
How you doing?

279
00:26:44.751 --> 00:26:46.317
Are you...?

280
00:26:47.152 --> 00:26:48.405
You're...

281
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.433
..."Sakagahwahwaya"?

282
00:26:51.642 --> 00:26:53.103
You're "Sakagawaya"?

283
00:26:53.312 --> 00:26:56.131
Oh, Sakagawea. You're Sakagawea?

284
00:26:56.758 --> 00:26:59.368
The glass. I can't...

285
00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:01.143
...hear you.

286
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:04.901
You can't...? You can't hear me?

287
00:27:05.006 --> 00:27:07.511
Excuse me.
"Who assisted the Lewis and Clark--"

288
00:27:07.825 --> 00:27:10.958
Right, so that's Lewis and Clark
and you're.... Right.

289
00:27:11.166 --> 00:27:13.359
You seem-- I'm Larry.

290
00:27:13.985 --> 00:27:17.431
What's going on? What's--?
Do you know what's going on here?

291
00:27:19.728 --> 00:27:21.294
Huns. I gotta--

292
00:28:08.038 --> 00:28:09.917
Hey. Hi.

293
00:28:10.126 --> 00:28:12.527
Tin Man. Hey. Hi. How you doing?

294
00:28:12.632 --> 00:28:15.868
I'm new. It says I'm supposed to
lock up the lions or they'll eat me.

295
00:28:17.052 --> 00:28:19.766
You're Galileo? No?

296
00:28:42.893 --> 00:28:44.162
Okay....

297
00:28:44.163 --> 00:28:45.938
Hey, I'm the....

298
00:28:47.608 --> 00:28:51.994
Hi. I'm the new guy
and I'm just locking up, so....

299
00:28:53.177 --> 00:28:56.623
If it's cool with you
I'm just gonna get my paperwork...

300
00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.565
...and be out of your hair, okay?

301
00:29:56.445 --> 00:30:00.203
"Double-check your belt.
The monkey probably stole your keys."

302
00:30:00.412 --> 00:30:02.083
Monkey.

303
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:08.869
Hey. Hey there. Hi.
What's your name? Your name is....

304
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.898
No, no, no. Come back. Come back.

305
00:30:12.002 --> 00:30:13.986
Dewey? Is that your name, Dewey?

306
00:30:14.195 --> 00:30:18.162
No, no, no. What's--? Dewey?
Dexter? Dexter. Dexter, right?

307
00:30:18.266 --> 00:30:20.459
Hey, Dexter,
you wanna give me those keys?

308
00:30:20.668 --> 00:30:22.965
I just want to lock up.

309
00:30:23.069 --> 00:30:25.262
Yes. Oh, good. Come to Papa.

310
00:30:25.366 --> 00:30:30.064
Oh, thank you. Can I have those keys?
Oh, good. What a good boy.

311
00:30:30.273 --> 00:30:32.152
That's okay. Oh, thank you.

312
00:30:32.361 --> 00:30:36.224
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
Thank you very, very much.

313
00:30:57.955 --> 00:30:59.834
Bad monkey. Stop that.

314
00:30:59.938 --> 00:31:03.071
That's not right. Are you done?

315
00:31:04.324 --> 00:31:06.934
Do you have an issue with me?
Do you have an issue with me?

316
00:31:07.142 --> 00:31:10.170
Because if I have a problem with somebody,
I don't pee on them, okay?

317
00:31:10.379 --> 00:31:13.616
And also-- Let me tell you something.
These keys?

318
00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.957
Hey. Dexter, that's not funny.
Give it back.

319
00:31:17.165 --> 00:31:18.940
Dexter. Give--

320
00:31:21.028 --> 00:31:25.206
Don't. I know what you're thinking.
Don't do it. Not a good idea.

321
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.876
Not-- Dexter, I need those.

322
00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:30.844
Don't encourage him. You think
you're funny for your friends, huh?

323
00:31:30.948 --> 00:31:34.080
You three guys-- What, he's the ringleader,
you're the audience?

324
00:31:34.185 --> 00:31:35.959
Yeah, no. Don't do it, okay?

325
00:31:36.064 --> 00:31:37.734
Lookit-- You!

326
00:31:50.889 --> 00:31:52.769
Oh, this is not happening.

327
00:32:01.744 --> 00:32:03.728
Oh, man.

328
00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:31.709
What are you guys doing?

329
00:32:32.648 --> 00:32:34.319
I can't feel my lip.

330
00:32:35.677 --> 00:32:37.348
Oh, shit.

331
00:32:40.811 --> 00:32:42.083
Man.

332
00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:08.791
Hey. Hey.

333
00:33:10.462 --> 00:33:12.446
Hey, stop that.

334
00:33:17.458 --> 00:33:19.337
Hog-tie him, boys.

335
00:33:20.486 --> 00:33:24.558
-Get him, that big old Bocephus of a man.
-Hey, what are you doing?

336
00:33:24.766 --> 00:33:27.063
Cinch him up good.
You ain't so big now, are you?

337
00:33:27.272 --> 00:33:29.256
Hey. Hey, stop that.

338
00:33:33.014 --> 00:33:35.625
Every night, year after year...

339
00:33:35.729 --> 00:33:39.279
...one of you guards
locks us up in these boxes.

340
00:33:39.488 --> 00:33:42.724
Well, I hereby say, sir, enough!

341
00:33:44.395 --> 00:33:46.587
Fire up the iron horse, boys.

342
00:33:54.732 --> 00:33:57.342
-Hey, blondie?
-Name's Jedediah.

343
00:33:57.551 --> 00:33:59.534
All right, Jedediah. Stop the train, please.

344
00:33:59.743 --> 00:34:03.293
-That's a big no-can-do, Cracker Jack.
-What's going on here, huh?

345
00:34:03.502 --> 00:34:05.694
-Somebody's gotta pay.
-Pay for what?

346
00:34:05.903 --> 00:34:10.706
I don't know. Just pay. Now, stop whining
and just take it like a man.

347
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.970
Seriously, stop the train.

348
00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.998
-All right, stop the train.
-Thank you.

349
00:34:20.207 --> 00:34:22.190
Now full speed ahead and ram him!

350
00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:24.175
Split his head like a watermelon!

351
00:34:26.368 --> 00:34:28.038
For crying out loud.

352
00:34:28.247 --> 00:34:29.709
All right, that's enough.

353
00:34:29.917 --> 00:34:32.736
We got a breach.

354
00:34:40.776 --> 00:34:45.787
I got him. I got him. I got him, guys.
I got him--

355
00:34:49.346 --> 00:34:52.791
-Oh, my....
-Prepare the catapults.

356
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.594
Octavius, hold on. This ain't your fight.
This here giant's on our land.

357
00:34:57.698 --> 00:35:00.205
Hey, little guy. Jed? Yeah.

358
00:35:00.414 --> 00:35:03.337
Sorry, look. I just-- I'm not a giant.
I'm just an average-sized--

359
00:35:03.546 --> 00:35:05.216
Don't talk down to me.

360
00:35:05.425 --> 00:35:08.453
I'm not a giant, guys. All right?
You guys are really little.

361
00:35:08.662 --> 00:35:12.942
We may be small,
but our hearts are large...

362
00:35:13.047 --> 00:35:15.031
...metaphorically speaking.

363
00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:17.536
Don't take that wrong.
I'm saying you're miniatures.

364
00:35:17.745 --> 00:35:20.668
Silence! The Roman Empire
knows no boundaries.

365
00:35:20.877 --> 00:35:23.383
-Don't you do it, son.
-Do what?

366
00:35:23.592 --> 00:35:24.949
-Octavius.
-Don't do what?

367
00:35:25.158 --> 00:35:28.603
-Unleash hell!
-Don't--

368
00:35:39.462 --> 00:35:41.237
Climb aboard, boy.

369
00:35:41.342 --> 00:35:43.430
Take the hand, son.

370
00:35:45.727 --> 00:35:47.084
Onboard.

371
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:52.618
That's right. You better run, boy.
You hear Jedediah?

372
00:35:52.722 --> 00:35:57.211
That mustachioed horseman ain't always
gonna be there to protect you, you hear me?

373
00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:01.701
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

374
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.789
Theodore Roosevelt,
26th president...

375
00:36:03.998 --> 00:36:06.295
...of these United States of America
at your service.

376
00:36:06.817 --> 00:36:11.411
Okay. I'm Larry Daley,
the new night guard.

377
00:36:14.231 --> 00:36:17.467
Pleasure to me you, Lawrence Daley.
You'll have to excuse me, though.

378
00:36:18.302 --> 00:36:20.182
The hunt is afoot.

379
00:36:21.643 --> 00:36:23.001
Hunt's afoot.

380
00:36:23.731 --> 00:36:27.072
Excuse me, Mr. President.
Could I ask you something?

381
00:36:27.281 --> 00:36:29.265
-Yes, but just one question.
-All right.

382
00:36:29.474 --> 00:36:32.710
Okay, why? Is it just some, like,
three-wishes kind of deal, or--?

383
00:36:34.276 --> 00:36:37.513
Not at all. Self-reliance
is the key to a vigorous life.

384
00:36:37.722 --> 00:36:41.898
A man must look inward to find
his own answers. How can I be of help?

385
00:36:42.002 --> 00:36:45.552
I don't really know how to put this,
and please don't take it the wrong way...

386
00:36:45.865 --> 00:36:49.312
...but isn't everything in this museum
supposed to be, you know...

387
00:36:49.521 --> 00:36:51.087
-...dead?
-Dead?

388
00:36:52.235 --> 00:36:55.054
-Yeah.
-Follow me.

389
00:36:57.977 --> 00:36:59.544
Yell all you want, pharaoh.

390
00:36:59.752 --> 00:37:03.720
You've been in there 54 years.
You're not getting out tonight.

391
00:37:04.033 --> 00:37:06.748
There's the source of all this commotion.

392
00:37:06.956 --> 00:37:10.193
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

393
00:37:10.924 --> 00:37:14.996
Arrived here in 1952
from the Nile expedition.

394
00:37:15.518 --> 00:37:21.364
On that night,
everything in this museum came to life.

395
00:37:21.469 --> 00:37:23.974
And every night since.

396
00:37:28.569 --> 00:37:32.015
So everything in the museum
comes to life every night?

397
00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:33.685
Exactly.

398
00:37:34.207 --> 00:37:36.817
And I'm supposed to do what?

399
00:37:37.026 --> 00:37:42.142
You're the night watchman, Lawrence.
A venerable position in this institution.

400
00:37:44.021 --> 00:37:47.258
-Come on, lad.
-All right. Okay. This is impossible.

401
00:37:47.467 --> 00:37:50.181
Nothing's impossible.
If it can be dreamed, it can be done.

402
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:53.418
Hence the 20-foot jackal staring at you.
Don't make eye contact.

403
00:37:53.522 --> 00:37:56.968
Your job is to make sure that everyone
stays inside the museum...

404
00:37:57.072 --> 00:37:59.787
...because if the sun rises
and anyone's on the outside...

405
00:37:59.891 --> 00:38:01.980
...we turn to dust.

406
00:38:02.502 --> 00:38:04.904
-You turn to dust?
-Dust.

407
00:38:05.112 --> 00:38:06.887
-Really?
-Really.

408
00:38:07.514 --> 00:38:10.437
Now, it's almost dawn.
I shall help you restore order tonight.

409
00:38:10.646 --> 00:38:14.196
But mark my words, it's the last time
I shall ever do so. Is that clear?

410
00:38:15.553 --> 00:38:18.789
Yeah. I mean-- I mean, I guess. I don't....

411
00:38:18.998 --> 00:38:21.922
Stop babbling, boy! Yes or no?

412
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:23.801
-Yes.
-Good.

413
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.993
Let's ride.

414
00:38:36.225 --> 00:38:39.567
All right.
So the Hall of Reptiles is secure.

415
00:38:48.024 --> 00:38:49.903
What are you looking at?

416
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.602
I'm tracking, dear boy.

417
00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:58.569
Man's got to track.
Welcome to the family, Lawrence.

418
00:38:59.613 --> 00:39:01.701
See you tomorrow night.

419
00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:04.625
Actually, I gotta be honest.
I don't think I'm coming back.

420
00:39:04.729 --> 00:39:07.026
What? You've only just begun.

421
00:39:07.235 --> 00:39:09.636
Yeah, well, this is not exactly what l--

422
00:39:09.845 --> 00:39:10.993
-Lawrence?
-Yeah?

423
00:39:11.202 --> 00:39:13.291
What did you do
before you took this post?

424
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.572
Well, I've done a lot of different things.
I invented this thing called the Snapper.

425
00:39:17.781 --> 00:39:19.347
Did you give up on that as well?

426
00:39:19.556 --> 00:39:22.792
No, I just hit a few roadblocks.
You might have heard of The Clapper?

427
00:39:23.001 --> 00:39:24.149
-Lawrence.
-Yes, sir?

428
00:39:24.358 --> 00:39:29.787
Some men are born great.
Others have greatness thrust upon them.

429
00:39:30.205 --> 00:39:33.964
For you, this is that very moment.

430
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:03.407
Bully. Got you, boy.

431
00:40:03.511 --> 00:40:04.973
Yeah. You got me.

432
00:40:08.836 --> 00:40:11.133
Say hello to your little friend.

433
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.683
-What are you doing?
-Put me down.

434
00:40:14.892 --> 00:40:16.980
I don't like to be manhandled.

435
00:40:17.188 --> 00:40:20.425
-Just calm down, Jed.
-lt doesn't feel good.

436
00:40:20.529 --> 00:40:24.184
-lt makes me feel small and powerless.
-You done?

437
00:40:24.288 --> 00:40:28.778
I'm gonna shoot you in your dang eye.
In your dadgum eye.

438
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:31.406
Yeah, keep shooting.
Nothing's gonna happen.

439
00:40:31.615 --> 00:40:34.121
Now you know my shame.

440
00:40:34.225 --> 00:40:39.759
Jedediah's impotent rage.
His guns don't fire. Take me away.

441
00:40:40.385 --> 00:40:42.473
This ain't over.
You ain't seen the last of me.

442
00:40:42.682 --> 00:40:44.770
I don't wanna hear it, okay?

443
00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:45.979
Duck!

444
00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:52.287
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

445
00:40:52.496 --> 00:40:54.042
This is not worth 1 1.50 an hour.

446
00:40:54.167 --> 00:40:58.343
Look, the giant's scared.
There's a bigger giant running around.

447
00:41:35.608 --> 00:41:37.383
Hello.

448
00:41:37.592 --> 00:41:39.159
Larry?

449
00:41:41.142 --> 00:41:42.604
Larry?

450
00:41:47.929 --> 00:41:51.165
Oh, don't do that.
We're too old for surprises.

451
00:41:51.374 --> 00:41:54.402
Really? I thought you liked surprises.
Like how you surprised me...

452
00:41:54.506 --> 00:41:57.430
...with the fact everything in
the museum comes to life at night.

453
00:41:57.639 --> 00:41:59.100
That little sweetheart.

454
00:41:59.205 --> 00:42:01.815
We wanted to tell you.
You never would have believed us.

455
00:42:02.024 --> 00:42:04.112
-You have any idea what I've been through?
-What?

456
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.601
-You have any idea what I've been through?
-Keep a lid on it, butterscotch.

457
00:42:08.706 --> 00:42:12.360
I don't know if what happened last night
was real, but I didn't sign up for this.

458
00:42:12.464 --> 00:42:16.537
I just need a regular job that
is not life-threatening and pays my bills.

459
00:42:16.746 --> 00:42:20.400
So thank you very much
and I left my uniform in the office...

460
00:42:20.609 --> 00:42:23.010
-...and I will be seeing you.
-Larry!

461
00:42:28.857 --> 00:42:31.363
-Dad?
-Hey.

462
00:42:31.467 --> 00:42:33.868
Hey, buddy.
What are you guys doing here?

463
00:42:33.973 --> 00:42:37.836
Oh, Erica had to be in court early,
so I'm taking Mr. Big Stuff here to school.

464
00:42:38.045 --> 00:42:40.341
But he wanted to swing by,
see you in the new job.

465
00:42:41.594 --> 00:42:43.787
It's so awesome
that you're working here.

466
00:42:44.518 --> 00:42:47.023
Hey, Niko, you wanna take
a little look-a-doo inside?

467
00:42:47.232 --> 00:42:49.216
Maybe your dad will give you a VlP tour.

468
00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.827
You know what?
We're pretty slammed this morning.

469
00:42:51.931 --> 00:42:56.525
Yeah, but Nicky, I promise,
I'll show you around soon, okay? Deal?

470
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.300
-Deal.
-All right.

471
00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:00.493
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

472
00:43:00.702 --> 00:43:02.372
-Love you.
-Love you too, buddy.

473
00:43:02.581 --> 00:43:04.356
Bye, now. All right.

474
00:43:34.121 --> 00:43:35.687
Hey, Larry.

475
00:43:35.896 --> 00:43:38.402
So I was thinking
maybe I'll give it one more night.

476
00:43:38.506 --> 00:43:40.490
I'm glad you came around.
Welcome back.

477
00:43:40.699 --> 00:43:43.831
You. New night guard, here, now.

478
00:43:51.975 --> 00:43:54.167
-What's up?
-"What's up? "

479
00:43:54.376 --> 00:43:57.926
Oh, well, take a walk with me
and I'll show you, Mr. "What's up? "

480
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:59.492
Come on.

481
00:44:01.058 --> 00:44:05.653
So would you kindly do me the favor
of explaining this?

482
00:44:09.411 --> 00:44:11.917
Okay. I'm guessing--

483
00:44:12.126 --> 00:44:16.824
And I'm just spitballing here,
but looks like that Roman dude got cocky...

484
00:44:17.033 --> 00:44:18.808
...and climbed over into the Wild West.

485
00:44:19.017 --> 00:44:22.149
And the cowboy knows Roman dude
wants to take over his territory...

486
00:44:22.253 --> 00:44:24.759
...so he rounded up a posse
and put him in the stockade.

487
00:44:26.651 --> 00:44:28.948
"Let's all laugh at me,
the comedy night guard."

488
00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:31.872
"No" is the answer.

489
00:44:32.081 --> 00:44:35.526
Sarcasm back at you,
with your humor box.

490
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:38.240
I wasn't laughing. Pretending to laugh...

491
00:44:38.449 --> 00:44:41.896
...if that's what you want,
some sort of battle of humor.

492
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.462
Do you?

493
00:44:45.028 --> 00:44:46.489
No.

494
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.830
I don't want--
No, I don't want a battle of humor.

495
00:44:49.935 --> 00:44:52.858
No, you don't,
because it would be a bloodbath.

496
00:44:53.485 --> 00:44:55.468
Nothing funny about Little Bighorn.

497
00:44:58.183 --> 00:45:02.464
No. I find it about as funny
as a "fancist."

498
00:45:03.194 --> 00:45:08.206
It's not funny. Okay? And I will not
stand for this type of blatant....

499
00:45:09.668 --> 00:45:12.173
If I'm not clear, tell me.

500
00:45:14.575 --> 00:45:15.933
Am I clear?

501
00:45:16.873 --> 00:45:18.647
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

502
00:45:22.824 --> 00:45:24.077
Hey, Cecil?

503
00:45:25.434 --> 00:45:28.148
You got an extra copy
of that instruction manual?

504
00:45:28.357 --> 00:45:32.429
Oh, no. I'm afraid not, Larry.
Listen, I'll tell you what you do.

505
00:45:32.638 --> 00:45:35.144
Read some books.
Brush up on your history.

506
00:45:35.352 --> 00:45:37.649
Helped me a lot when I first started out.

507
00:45:39.215 --> 00:45:43.078
This museum was originally dedicated
to that man on the horse up there...

508
00:45:43.287 --> 00:45:44.749
...President Theodore Roosevelt.

509
00:45:44.958 --> 00:45:49.029
He absolutely loved history and believed
that the more you know about the past...

510
00:45:49.238 --> 00:45:52.163
...the better prepared you are
for the future.

511
00:45:53.624 --> 00:45:57.174
Okay, kids. Who can tell me
what this room's called?

512
00:45:57.383 --> 00:45:59.784
Very good. The Hall of African Mammals.

513
00:45:59.993 --> 00:46:02.812
Right here we have the king of the jungle,
the lion.

514
00:46:03.438 --> 00:46:07.510
Up ahead is one of my favorite creatures
in the whole museum, the capuchin monkey.

515
00:46:07.719 --> 00:46:12.626
A highly intelligent primate
known for its loving and generous nature.

516
00:46:16.594 --> 00:46:17.951
Excuse me?

517
00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.083
I just thought that was....

518
00:46:21.292 --> 00:46:24.006
I just was laughing in agreement.

519
00:46:26.199 --> 00:46:27.975
Happy monkey.

520
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:31.525
All right, kids. This way.

521
00:46:36.849 --> 00:46:38.937
Let me tell you something.
I'm not buying it.

522
00:46:39.146 --> 00:46:42.592
You might have them fooled,
you might have the kids fooled. Not me.

523
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.246
Can't get past me.
There's a storm coming, buddy.

524
00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:47.916
There's a storm coming.

525
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.076
One of the most famous trackers
in history, Sakagawea was the woman...

526
00:46:54.181 --> 00:46:57.522
...who led Lewis and Clark on
their expedition to find the Pacific Ocean.

527
00:46:57.626 --> 00:47:00.967
You guys have heard the saying,
"Actions speak louder than words."

528
00:47:01.071 --> 00:47:03.159
And yet they wrote--

529
00:47:03.264 --> 00:47:05.979
-Yes, Mr. Daley?
-Yes. Was she deaf?

530
00:47:07.337 --> 00:47:11.095
Was she deaf? No. She was not.
But she--

531
00:47:11.304 --> 00:47:16.629
Yeah, because-- Just-- She does seem
a little bit sort of unresponsive.

532
00:47:16.838 --> 00:47:18.404
That's because she's a statue.

533
00:47:20.596 --> 00:47:24.355
Kids, could you give me one sec?
Go check her out. She's really cool.

534
00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:28.844
-What are you doing?
-I'm gonna be here every night.

535
00:47:29.053 --> 00:47:31.872
I wanted to learn a little bit more
about what I'm guarding.

536
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:34.065
Actually, I've got a bunch of questions.

537
00:47:34.169 --> 00:47:37.092
Maybe when you have a break,
could I buy you a cup of coffee?

538
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:38.658
A cup of coffee?

539
00:47:38.658 --> 00:47:40.956
Yeah, I mean, just purely a, you know...

540
00:47:41.061 --> 00:47:45.550
...colleague-to-colleague,
information-download sort of coffee.

541
00:47:46.699 --> 00:47:48.682
I finish in 20 minutes.
I'll meet you outside.

542
00:47:48.891 --> 00:47:50.353
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

543
00:47:50.562 --> 00:47:53.381
-And have a good rest of your--
-All right. Okay, kids.

544
00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.691
It was incredible what she did.

545
00:47:55.795 --> 00:47:59.032
She literally led these men
across rivers, up mountains...

546
00:47:59.241 --> 00:48:02.790
...all with her newborn baby on her back.
She was the ultimate working mother.

547
00:48:02.895 --> 00:48:05.296
Wow, you are quite
the Sakagawean expert.

548
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.489
-Sakagawean.
-Sakagawean?

549
00:48:07.697 --> 00:48:11.978
Yeah. I should be, I've been writing
my dissertation on her for four years.

550
00:48:12.082 --> 00:48:16.050
You've been working on one paper
for four years? That would drive me crazy.

551
00:48:16.259 --> 00:48:20.331
Actually, it's more like a 900-page book.

552
00:48:20.958 --> 00:48:24.925
So, what's your story? Have you
always wanted to be a security guard?

553
00:48:25.761 --> 00:48:28.997
-Oh, I didn't mean to--
-No, no, no.

554
00:48:29.102 --> 00:48:32.965
No, I'm divorced
and I have a 1 0-year-old son...

555
00:48:33.173 --> 00:48:36.932
...so I needed to find
a more steady situation.

556
00:48:37.141 --> 00:48:40.169
Got it. So, what can I tell you
about the museum?

557
00:48:40.377 --> 00:48:43.405
Okay, Attila the Hun.
What is that guy's problem?

558
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:46.642
Attila was considered the only
genuine threat to the Roman Empire.

559
00:48:47.164 --> 00:48:50.087
" Known as the 'Scourge of God'...

560
00:48:50.191 --> 00:48:54.786
...Attila and his Huns would often
tear off the limbs of their helpless victims.

561
00:48:56.874 --> 00:48:59.171
Attila was famous
for his superstitious beliefs.

562
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:03.452
He surrounded himself with a phalanx
of sorcerers and magicians...

563
00:49:03.661 --> 00:49:06.897
...who advised and mystified him
with their dark arts."

564
00:49:59.623 --> 00:50:01.085
Larry?

565
00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:03.069
Just wanted to say good luck, son.

566
00:50:03.382 --> 00:50:05.889
And goodbye.
We're clocking out for the last time.

567
00:50:05.993 --> 00:50:07.663
If you're ever in Boca, look us up.

568
00:50:07.768 --> 00:50:11.004
Wait, you guys are going out of town?
What if this doesn't work out?

569
00:50:11.213 --> 00:50:13.719
Smart fellow like you? You'll be fine.

570
00:50:13.928 --> 00:50:18.417
Yeah. We'll just be a phone call away.
Come on, walk us out.

571
00:50:18.626 --> 00:50:21.445
You fellas go ahead.

572
00:50:22.698 --> 00:50:24.368
I need a moment.

573
00:50:24.473 --> 00:50:29.171
He's very emotional.
A lot of memories in this room.

574
00:51:25.552 --> 00:51:27.640
Go crazy, big guy.

575
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.531
Hey, guys.

576
00:51:34.635 --> 00:51:36.619
Quest for fire...

577
00:51:37.141 --> 00:51:40.378
...over. Knock yourselves out.

578
00:51:42.153 --> 00:51:43.510
Morning, dum-dum.

579
00:51:43.719 --> 00:51:47.373
Me no dum-dum. You dum-dum.
You bring me gum-gum?

580
00:51:47.582 --> 00:51:51.654
Yes, I did, fathead.
Lots and lots of gum-gum.

581
00:52:11.492 --> 00:52:16.607
What's that?
I can't hear you through the glass.

582
00:52:18.487 --> 00:52:20.053
Sorry.

583
00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:22.454
Heave.

584
00:52:22.872 --> 00:52:25.795
Heave. Heave.

585
00:52:26.004 --> 00:52:28.510
Hey, what's going on over here?

586
00:52:28.719 --> 00:52:31.016
We expand or we die.

587
00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:33.522
Heave.

588
00:52:33.731 --> 00:52:35.193
-Heave.
-On the count of three...

589
00:52:35.401 --> 00:52:38.847
...you blow this anthill to kingdom come.

590
00:52:39.473 --> 00:52:42.814
-And a one and a two--
-Hey, Jed. Stop that.

591
00:52:43.023 --> 00:52:46.886
No, no. You blow a hole in your mountain,
all you're gonna hit is a wall.

592
00:52:46.991 --> 00:52:51.376
Step aside, Gigantor. We got us a railroad
to build. We're blowing a hole in that thing.

593
00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.821
Okay, first of all, enough with
the Gigantor giant stuff, okay?

594
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:58.788
-I'm just trying to close up shop.
-We're gonna blow it anyway. And a three!

595
00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:03.904
Yeah. What are you doing?

596
00:53:04.217 --> 00:53:07.351
What's it look like we're doing?
It's manifest destiny.

597
00:53:07.455 --> 00:53:11.318
You can't fight it and neither can l.
Go! More dynamite.

598
00:53:11.527 --> 00:53:13.928
-Yeah, use it all.
-All right. Okay.

599
00:53:14.137 --> 00:53:16.852
Listen, "Octavus"? You gotta stop that.

600
00:53:16.956 --> 00:53:18.940
It's Octavius, mary.

601
00:53:19.044 --> 00:53:22.803
Okay, you know what? Fine. Great.
Here you go. This is what happens.

602
00:53:22.907 --> 00:53:25.204
-You cannot do this. I am a Roman general.
-Sorry.

603
00:53:25.308 --> 00:53:26.561
-I have rights.
-And you.

604
00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:29.276
-Hey, no! Put me down!
-Keep heaving, men.

605
00:53:29.485 --> 00:53:30.737
You can't stop progress!

606
00:53:30.946 --> 00:53:33.139
We're gonna have a little talk, okay?

607
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:36.271
I told you, I don't like to be manhandled.

608
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.030
No, I will manhandle you, Jedediah.
Now, listen, guys.

609
00:53:40.238 --> 00:53:42.850
What is your problem, huh?
Why can't you just get along?

610
00:53:43.058 --> 00:53:45.355
Look, we're men. We fight, okay?
That's what we do.

611
00:53:45.564 --> 00:53:47.130
It's kind of how we pass the time.

612
00:53:47.339 --> 00:53:51.724
You're, like, a giant. A freak, if you will.
We can't expect you to understand that.

613
00:53:51.828 --> 00:53:55.587
You got the whole room to run around in.
You don't have to be near each other.

614
00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:59.868
-What, you mean...?
-You're gonna let us out?

615
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:02.791
What, and just roam free?

616
00:54:03.222 --> 00:54:05.728
Yeah. Yeah, I might,
if you promise to behave.

617
00:54:05.936 --> 00:54:09.069
That means no fireballs,
no explosions, okay?

618
00:54:09.277 --> 00:54:10.426
You have my word, my liege.

619
00:54:10.635 --> 00:54:13.349
Yeah, no problemo, Gigantor.

620
00:54:13.454 --> 00:54:17.421
My name's Larry, first of all. Okay, Jed?

621
00:54:17.525 --> 00:54:20.345
So I call you Jed.
I don't call you Tiny, right?

622
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.016
What's that supposed to mean?

623
00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:27.863
-"Hey, Teeny." How does that sound?
-I don't like it. It hurts my feelings.

624
00:54:27.967 --> 00:54:30.682
"Gigantor" makes me feel
like some sort of freak, so....

625
00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.396
I don't. I just call you Larry.

626
00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.484
Don't be a kiss-ass, okay?

627
00:54:35.693 --> 00:54:37.572
Look, I'm trusting you guys, all right?

628
00:54:37.677 --> 00:54:41.122
If you don't do what I say,
you can end up like the Mayan world there.

629
00:54:41.331 --> 00:54:43.419
Locked up. Take a look.

630
00:54:43.628 --> 00:54:46.760
-Do they look happy?
-No.

631
00:54:48.013 --> 00:54:49.370
They look sad.

632
00:54:49.579 --> 00:54:52.607
They can't do what they wanna do.
Now, I'm letting you guys...

633
00:54:52.816 --> 00:54:56.053
...have a little bit of leash here.
Don't choke me with it, okay?

634
00:54:56.262 --> 00:55:00.438
I gotta run. You guys play nice, okay?
Okay. Good. Thanks.

635
00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:04.406
Hey, how's that gum treating you,
dum-dum?

636
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:05.867
Good.

637
00:55:09.313 --> 00:55:12.132
Oh, hey, Dexter.
I'm just locking up. You want in?

638
00:55:13.802 --> 00:55:15.368
Yeah?

639
00:55:16.934 --> 00:55:18.605
All right.

640
00:55:24.556 --> 00:55:26.435
What's that? You got my keys?

641
00:55:29.045 --> 00:55:30.507
I don't think so.

642
00:55:32.387 --> 00:55:36.877
Looks like Uncle Larry pulled a fast one
on little Dexie.

643
00:55:37.086 --> 00:55:39.069
Those are baby keys for a little baby.

644
00:55:39.278 --> 00:55:41.471
Have fun with your baby keys,
little baby monkey.

645
00:55:41.679 --> 00:55:45.125
Tomorrow I'll bring you a little baby diapy
so you can go poo-poo in it.

646
00:55:45.229 --> 00:55:47.630
I'll give you a tickle
because you're a cute baby.

647
00:55:47.735 --> 00:55:52.538
While you cry all night long
about how Uncle Larry fooled you, huh?

648
00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.043
I told you there was a storm coming.

649
00:56:02.356 --> 00:56:04.653
-Hey, Teddy.
-Lawrence.

650
00:56:04.757 --> 00:56:07.368
You impertinent pup.
I knew you'd come back.

651
00:56:07.682 --> 00:56:11.336
-You look like a man on a mission.
-Yeah, I'm gonna give it another shot.

652
00:56:19.271 --> 00:56:21.881
-You...?
-What?

653
00:56:21.985 --> 00:56:25.326
-You checking her out?
-The nerve.

654
00:56:25.535 --> 00:56:28.459
Checking her out.
I've never heard of such a thing.

655
00:56:28.667 --> 00:56:32.635
No, no, no. I'm just-- I mean
because, you know, she's very beautiful.

656
00:56:32.739 --> 00:56:34.514
-Beautiful?
-Yeah.

657
00:56:38.586 --> 00:56:41.196
-Rather handsome woman, I suppose.
-Yeah.

658
00:56:41.614 --> 00:56:44.225
I don't know,
maybe you should go talk to her.

659
00:56:44.329 --> 00:56:46.939
-lndeed. Bless you, lad.
-Yeah. All right.

660
00:56:47.148 --> 00:56:49.967
-Carry on.
-Good. See you.

661
00:57:07.194 --> 00:57:08.969
I....

662
00:57:56.484 --> 00:57:58.155
Hey, hi.

663
00:57:58.886 --> 00:58:02.435
No! It's okay!
It's okay. You guys speak English?

664
00:58:02.853 --> 00:58:04.001
No?

665
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.491
Right. I don't know what that means...

666
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:12.772
...and I know that you and I got off
on the wrong foot last night, but...

667
00:58:14.755 --> 00:58:19.349
...a little birdie told me
that somebody likes...

668
00:58:20.184 --> 00:58:21.437
...magic.

669
00:58:21.646 --> 00:58:24.569
-Magic?
-Magic.

670
00:58:25.405 --> 00:58:27.075
Sorcery.

671
00:58:27.388 --> 00:58:28.850
Ah, sorcer--

672
00:58:28.954 --> 00:58:31.460
Yes. Illusion.

673
00:58:31.773 --> 00:58:33.236
Everybody likes magic.

674
00:58:33.445 --> 00:58:37.412
And flowers. People like flowers.

675
00:58:37.621 --> 00:58:39.083
There you go. Those are for you.

676
00:58:39.292 --> 00:58:41.797
You know what else people like?
Money.

677
00:58:42.006 --> 00:58:46.391
The almighty dollar, right?
But money can sometimes...

678
00:58:47.331 --> 00:58:48.584
...disappear.

679
00:58:51.507 --> 00:58:53.491
At least that's what l...

680
00:58:54.222 --> 00:58:55.370
...hear.

681
00:58:57.041 --> 00:59:00.799
No wonder you can't understand me.
You got a coin in your ear.

682
00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:06.855
Check this out. Anybody need a hanky?

683
00:59:07.168 --> 00:59:11.554
Well, I wouldn't suggest this little
feller because he has a nasty habit...

684
00:59:12.076 --> 00:59:14.373
...of vanishing...

685
00:59:16.461 --> 00:59:18.445
...into thin air!

686
00:59:19.384 --> 00:59:21.681
No, no. Don't. That defeats the-- Don't!

687
00:59:39.639 --> 00:59:43.920
Not the limbs. Guys, please,
do not tear the limbs.

688
01:00:00.321 --> 01:00:02.096
Cortes, right?

689
01:00:18.275 --> 01:00:19.527
How?

690
01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:24.853
You! Don't even think about it.
Don't you--

691
01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:27.150
Dexter!

692
01:00:37.591 --> 01:00:39.157
Come on, guys!

693
01:01:04.633 --> 01:01:06.199
Hey, guys!

694
01:01:10.075 --> 01:01:12.581
Hey, guys. Hey, guys!

695
01:01:14.669 --> 01:01:16.653
Sorry. What's going on?
What happened here?

696
01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:18.114
I thought we had a deal.

697
01:01:18.323 --> 01:01:20.516
We will never coexist
with these buffoons.

698
01:01:20.724 --> 01:01:22.604
We're past words, Laredo.

699
01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:25.840
Now it's time to let Smith & Wesson
do the talking!

700
01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:27.406
Those guns don't even work.

701
01:01:27.511 --> 01:01:29.808
They don't? Take a look at this.

702
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.194
Dexter!

703
01:02:23.683 --> 01:02:24.936
Why?

704
01:02:31.827 --> 01:02:33.915
Ho! Dexter.

705
01:02:41.432 --> 01:02:43.520
End of the line, cool breeze.

706
01:02:45.086 --> 01:02:46.549
End of the line.

707
01:03:04.924 --> 01:03:06.699
I am not playing games here.

708
01:03:10.875 --> 01:03:12.546
Just hand them over.

709
01:03:17.766 --> 01:03:20.063
Easy. That's it, Dexter.

710
01:03:20.272 --> 01:03:22.361
Nice and easy, Dex. That's it.

711
01:03:44.599 --> 01:03:47.209
Good Lord, Lawrence!
Why are you slapping a monkey?

712
01:03:47.836 --> 01:03:51.072
Teddy, this guy's been pushing me,
and I'm sick of it!

713
01:03:51.281 --> 01:03:54.309
Poppycock. This little creature is
your primate brother.

714
01:03:54.518 --> 01:03:56.293
Without him, there's no us.

715
01:03:56.919 --> 01:03:58.172
Are you rabid?

716
01:03:58.382 --> 01:04:00.052
Wipe that off.

717
01:04:00.783 --> 01:04:03.393
You have to deal with this creature
with love and respect.

718
01:04:03.602 --> 01:04:05.377
May I have the keys, dear friend?

719
01:04:06.839 --> 01:04:09.240
Thank you. Lawrence?

720
01:04:11.328 --> 01:04:12.581
Well, you know what?

721
01:04:12.790 --> 01:04:15.818
You seem to know what you're doing,
so I'm gonna let you take over.

722
01:04:16.026 --> 01:04:19.054
No, no. My dear boy, you can't put up
the white flag now.

723
01:04:19.263 --> 01:04:21.247
The museum is on the verge
of total anarchy.

724
01:04:21.456 --> 01:04:23.126
I tried! I came back tonight,
didn't l?

725
01:04:23.335 --> 01:04:26.676
Tried? That was one night. I didn't build
the Panama Canal in one day.

726
01:04:26.885 --> 01:04:30.121
That's great, but I'm dealing with
the most ridiculous job in history.

727
01:04:30.226 --> 01:04:31.792
Some men are born great, Lawrence--

728
01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:34.402
Yeah, I know. Others have
greatness thrust upon them.

729
01:04:34.716 --> 01:04:36.491
You hit me with that chestnut
last night.

730
01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:39.206
The thing is, not everyone is great.

731
01:04:39.414 --> 01:04:42.024
That's the problem.
Some of us are just ordinary.

732
01:04:42.233 --> 01:04:44.843
No, you're not, Lawrence.
Stop wallowing in self-pity.

733
01:04:45.052 --> 01:04:46.723
Every journey begins with a footstep.

734
01:04:46.932 --> 01:04:50.168
Teach the inhabitants to get along,
they wouldn't need to be locked up.

735
01:04:50.377 --> 01:04:53.405
That means a lot coming from a guy
who's spent the last 50 years...

736
01:04:53.613 --> 01:04:55.806
...spying on a girl he's never even
talked to.

737
01:04:56.641 --> 01:04:59.669
I was going to make contact.
Lawrence, please.

738
01:05:00.204 --> 01:05:01.979
I'm done, all right?

739
01:05:06.364 --> 01:05:09.601
No, Rexy! No!

740
01:05:41.341 --> 01:05:43.429
Oh, no.

741
01:06:46.805 --> 01:06:48.580
All right.

742
01:06:57.768 --> 01:07:01.528
No one comes here anymore. Besides,
I took this tour in second grade, Daley.

743
01:07:01.736 --> 01:07:04.138
I'm telling you,
my dad's gonna hook us up.

744
01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:06.748
-Mr. Daley?
-Yeah?

745
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:10.089
-Foam.
-Yes, I know.

746
01:07:10.298 --> 01:07:11.551
In the Neanderthal display.

747
01:07:11.759 --> 01:07:14.683
There was an incident last night
with the fire extinguisher.

748
01:07:14.892 --> 01:07:16.562
I was on my way to go clean it up.

749
01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:19.172
Okay, don't bother. You're fired.

750
01:07:20.947 --> 01:07:23.140
I don't think we're getting a tour today.

751
01:07:23.348 --> 01:07:25.332
Your dad just got canned, dude.

752
01:07:26.898 --> 01:07:28.882
Excuse me?

753
01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.866
Mr. McPhee?

754
01:07:31.805 --> 01:07:33.163
Excuse me, Mr. McPhee?

755
01:07:33.371 --> 01:07:35.669
Can I talk to you about this, please?

756
01:07:35.878 --> 01:07:37.027
-Sir?
-What?

757
01:07:37.131 --> 01:07:40.054
I know I screwed up, but I finally
understand how to do this job.

758
01:07:40.263 --> 01:07:43.395
-You obviously don't.
-No, I didn't, but now I do.

759
01:07:43.604 --> 01:07:46.319
-Really, Mr. McPhee--
-Doctor.

760
01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:48.629
Dr. McPhee.

761
01:07:49.568 --> 01:07:51.448
Can you please give me one more night?

762
01:07:54.267 --> 01:07:56.459
-One more night.
-Okay, thank you.

763
01:07:56.564 --> 01:07:59.905
And if anything is the tiniest...

764
01:08:01.157 --> 01:08:02.828
...after your shift:

765
01:08:04.916 --> 01:08:06.169
Because....

766
01:08:09.197 --> 01:08:10.867
-Got it.
-Okay?

767
01:08:11.076 --> 01:08:14.836
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice....

768
01:08:19.743 --> 01:08:22.979
Shame on me. Fool me--
Shame on me.

769
01:08:23.084 --> 01:08:25.589
-You.
-Fool me twice.... Got it.

770
01:08:25.798 --> 01:08:28.513
-Take it or leave it.
-Okay. Thank you.

771
01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.568
-Hey.
-Hey.

772
01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:37.909
-What's wrong?
-Maybe you should ask Nicky.

773
01:08:40.415 --> 01:08:43.130
Hey, buddy. What's going on?

774
01:08:43.756 --> 01:08:45.322
You got fired.

775
01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.933
What are you talking about?
I didn't get fired.

776
01:08:49.395 --> 01:08:53.153
I came to the museum this morning.
I saw your boss yelling at you.

777
01:08:54.093 --> 01:08:56.808
Why didn't you tell me?
Everything's fine.

778
01:08:57.016 --> 01:08:59.105
We just had a little misunderstanding.

779
01:08:59.209 --> 01:09:00.671
Why?

780
01:09:02.028 --> 01:09:05.056
It's hard to explain.
I mean, you wouldn't bel--

781
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:09.336
You know what? Let me show you.

782
01:09:09.754 --> 01:09:11.946
-Show me what?
-Come to work with me tonight.

783
01:09:12.155 --> 01:09:13.513
Larry?

784
01:09:13.617 --> 01:09:16.332
Can I talk to you for a second?

785
01:09:19.464 --> 01:09:20.821
Am I in trouble?

786
01:09:20.925 --> 01:09:22.700
Larry, what are you doing?

787
01:09:22.909 --> 01:09:25.311
I just wanna show him what I do.
That's all.

788
01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:28.444
I love that you wanna share that
with him, but I gotta tell you...

789
01:09:28.652 --> 01:09:32.202
...I don't think Nicky has any room
in his heart for more disappointment.

790
01:09:33.559 --> 01:09:35.126
He won't be disappointed.

791
01:09:35.961 --> 01:09:37.214
Larry.

792
01:09:37.736 --> 01:09:39.719
He won't be disappointed.

793
01:09:45.579 --> 01:09:48.629
Listen, hang out in the security
office till everyone's gone.

794
01:09:48.907 --> 01:09:51.018
Then I'm gonna come get you.
All right?

795
01:10:10.781 --> 01:10:14.017
Hey, miss? I'm gonna have to ask you
to vacate the premises.

796
01:10:14.017 --> 01:10:15.375
-Hey there.
-Hey.

797
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:20.282
-Good place to think, huh?
-Yeah. Definitely.

798
01:10:21.326 --> 01:10:23.832
So no big plans tonight?

799
01:10:23.936 --> 01:10:26.859
Yeah, no, I'm not really
a big-plan person.

800
01:10:27.173 --> 01:10:29.887
I prefer hanging out with people
who are dead for 200 years.

801
01:10:30.096 --> 01:10:31.766
It's the live ones that throw me.

802
01:10:31.871 --> 01:10:35.734
That's cool. Seriously though,
you do have to leave.

803
01:10:35.838 --> 01:10:37.926
-Seriously?
-Yeah, sorry. It's museum rules.

804
01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:40.745
We're sort of locking everything up.

805
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:44.086
You're really taking your job seriously.

806
01:10:44.399 --> 01:10:47.741
You know, once I clip on the tie,
I'm all business.

807
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:49.099
-I get it.
-Yeah.

808
01:10:49.308 --> 01:10:51.187
How's that dissertation coming?

809
01:10:52.544 --> 01:10:55.781
I've hit a dead end. I mean,
research can only get me so far.

810
01:10:55.989 --> 01:10:57.869
I'm never gonna know
who she really was.

811
01:10:58.495 --> 01:11:02.671
So I think it's time that I move on
to another subject.

812
01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:04.968
I'll let you get back to work.

813
01:11:06.639 --> 01:11:10.189
-Good night, Larry.
-Yeah, okay.

814
01:11:10.502 --> 01:11:12.277
Night.

815
01:11:19.481 --> 01:11:20.838
Hey.

816
01:11:22.301 --> 01:11:23.971
Rebecca!

817
01:11:26.477 --> 01:11:28.774
-Hey, Rebecca.
-Hey.

818
01:11:28.983 --> 01:11:32.219
Hey. Listen, I don't think you should
give up on your paper.

819
01:11:32.324 --> 01:11:34.203
Okay. Why?

820
01:11:34.412 --> 01:11:37.231
All right, look, this is gonna
sound crazy, all right?

821
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.945
I mean, it's gonna sound, like,
really, really crazy.

822
01:11:40.154 --> 01:11:42.869
-Okay.
-No, I mean insanely crazy.

823
01:11:42.973 --> 01:11:44.539
-I can handle it.
-Okay.

824
01:11:45.583 --> 01:11:49.342
You know how they say in certain
museums, history comes alive?

825
01:11:49.446 --> 01:11:52.370
-Yeah.
-ln this museum...

826
01:11:53.205 --> 01:11:54.771
...it actually does.

827
01:11:56.546 --> 01:11:58.217
What are you talking about?

828
01:12:02.811 --> 01:12:07.196
Everything in this museum
comes to life at night.

829
01:12:10.642 --> 01:12:13.774
-Really?
-Yeah, really. I'm not kidding you.

830
01:12:13.982 --> 01:12:16.071
You know that tablet?
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah?

831
01:12:16.279 --> 01:12:19.203
It actually brings things to life.
It's like some ancient spell.

832
01:12:19.412 --> 01:12:22.126
Since the '50s, every night
everything's been coming to life.

833
01:12:22.335 --> 01:12:27.451
Teddy Roosevelt told me. Seriously.
The monkey, Dexter? The cute little--

834
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:29.121
-What is he?
-Capuchin.

835
01:12:29.226 --> 01:12:32.567
A capuchin. Right. The capuchin.
He urinated on me and bit my nose.

836
01:12:33.506 --> 01:12:37.370
And Sakagawea is in her case,
alive every night...

837
01:12:37.579 --> 01:12:39.772
...just listening to Lewis and Clark
argue.

838
01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:42.382
So if you really wanna get inside
her head...

839
01:12:43.739 --> 01:12:45.618
...I can hook that up.

840
01:12:47.184 --> 01:12:48.437
That's cool.

841
01:12:48.646 --> 01:12:51.778
Yeah, it's cool. It's freaking awesome.

842
01:12:55.119 --> 01:12:57.103
Make fun of the history geek.

843
01:12:57.833 --> 01:13:00.966
-No. Rebecca!
-Good night, Larry.

844
01:13:02.854 --> 01:13:05.673
No, I'm not making fun of you.
Rebecca.

845
01:13:16.537 --> 01:13:19.042
-Here you go. Best seat in the house.
-What's going on?

846
01:13:19.251 --> 01:13:21.757
If I told you, you'd think I'm crazy.
I'm gonna show you.

847
01:13:21.966 --> 01:13:25.516
-What?
-You'll see in about 20 seconds.

848
01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.799
-Okay, you like Tyrannosaurus Rex?
-Yeah.

849
01:13:28.008 --> 01:13:30.217
Yeah? Well, I call him Rexy.

850
01:13:30.218 --> 01:13:34.708
And he's about to come to life,
Nicholas, in...

851
01:13:37.109 --> 01:13:42.120
...five, four, three, two....

852
01:13:49.221 --> 01:13:51.727
-Dad?
-Hang on a sec.

853
01:13:51.936 --> 01:13:55.277
Say hello to Rexy!

854
01:13:56.425 --> 01:13:57.574
Dad, are you okay?

855
01:13:59.975 --> 01:14:01.437
This is weird.

856
01:14:01.541 --> 01:14:03.629
Guys! Come on!

857
01:14:04.255 --> 01:14:06.030
Sundown!

858
01:14:08.327 --> 01:14:11.773
Hey, T.R., come on, rise and shine.
Buddy, I need you to wake up.

859
01:14:11.877 --> 01:14:13.965
Come on, my kid is here.
I need you to wake up.

860
01:14:14.174 --> 01:14:17.306
Texas? Texas! Come on!
Texas! Come on! Get on, Texas!

861
01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:19.394
Get on, Texas! Get up.

862
01:14:19.603 --> 01:14:21.691
Just stop, okay?

863
01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:25.346
No, Nicky, I'm telling you,
there's this tablet, okay?

864
01:14:25.451 --> 01:14:27.539
Called the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.
Every night--

865
01:14:27.643 --> 01:14:30.358
-Now there's a tablet?
-Yeah, there is.

866
01:14:30.471 --> 01:14:31.933
Come on, Dad.

867
01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:35.265
Come on.

868
01:14:39.854 --> 01:14:41.838
-It's gone.
-What's gone?

869
01:14:41.943 --> 01:14:45.492
The tablet. I think somebody stole it.

870
01:14:45.806 --> 01:14:47.476
Yeah, right.

871
01:14:47.685 --> 01:14:49.460
I'm not kidding, Nicky.

872
01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:54.471
Nicky?

873
01:14:56.455 --> 01:14:58.439
Hey, Nicky!

874
01:14:59.901 --> 01:15:02.616
Hey! Hey, Nicky! Where are you going?

875
01:15:02.825 --> 01:15:05.748
-Home.
-What? Wait a minute.

876
01:15:10.133 --> 01:15:11.595
Come on.

877
01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.975
You guys shouldn't be here.

878
01:15:23.184 --> 01:15:24.437
Give us the tablet, son.

879
01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:26.629
Wait a minute, Nicky.
What are you guys doing?

880
01:15:26.734 --> 01:15:29.030
We're not gonna hurt you.
Give us the tablet.

881
01:15:29.135 --> 01:15:32.163
I'm sorry to tell you this, son,
but your dad doesn't work here.

882
01:15:32.163 --> 01:15:35.296
He got fired this morning.
Couldn't hack it.

883
01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.428
Dad? I thought you said
you weren't fired.

884
01:15:38.532 --> 01:15:40.934
I did. They're lying,
trying to steal that thing.

885
01:15:41.143 --> 01:15:43.627
Turn the middle piece,
you'll see what I was talking about.

886
01:15:43.761 --> 01:15:45.641
That is museum property, son.
Give it back.

887
01:15:45.745 --> 01:15:47.729
Nicky, trust me. Just turn it.

888
01:15:48.147 --> 01:15:50.235
-Give us the tablet!
-Nicky?

889
01:15:50.965 --> 01:15:52.427
Trust me.

890
01:16:14.575 --> 01:16:16.037
Nick? Run. Now.

891
01:16:17.286 --> 01:16:19.165
Get back here, kid!

892
01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:23.545
Bad idea, Larry.

893
01:16:24.063 --> 01:16:26.673
You wanna dance, hot dog?
You wanna dance?

894
01:16:26.778 --> 01:16:28.970
Gus, you're an old man.
I don't wanna hurt you.

895
01:16:31.267 --> 01:16:35.026
You see, Larry, a few years into
the job, the three of us realized that...

896
01:16:35.234 --> 01:16:39.306
...like everything else in this museum,
we got new life at night.

897
01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.556
Sundown to sunrise,
we felt young again.

898
01:16:44.744 --> 01:16:46.310
Okay. Did not see that coming.

899
01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:48.191
Gave us an energy boost.

900
01:16:48.295 --> 01:16:50.592
We love the nightlife, Larry.

901
01:16:51.001 --> 01:16:53.089
So when we found out
they were gonna fired us...

902
01:16:53.298 --> 01:16:54.759
...we had to steal the tablet.

903
01:16:54.968 --> 01:16:56.952
Everyone knows you need the money.

904
01:16:57.161 --> 01:16:59.040
Add the stuff we planted
in your place...

905
01:16:59.144 --> 01:17:01.337
...pretty obvious you committed
the crime.

906
01:17:01.546 --> 01:17:03.425
Take care of that cut.

907
01:17:03.634 --> 01:17:05.618
Come on, guys, let's go find that kid.

908
01:17:07.497 --> 01:17:09.585
-Sweet dreams, cupcake!
-No!

909
01:17:09.689 --> 01:17:11.151
Pile driver!

910
01:17:11.802 --> 01:17:13.766
Let's get our tablet.

911
01:17:39.259 --> 01:17:41.556
Thank you very much.
We'll take it from here.

912
01:17:41.765 --> 01:17:43.331
Nicky!

913
01:17:45.315 --> 01:17:48.134
Just in time, Larry.
We were just locking up.

914
01:17:49.491 --> 01:17:51.579
Sleep tight, hotshot.

915
01:17:53.563 --> 01:17:55.442
Let's grab everything we can fence.

916
01:17:55.546 --> 01:17:59.932
I don't know about you,
but I'm planning on a long retirement.

917
01:18:08.167 --> 01:18:11.613
Teddy! Teddy, if you're out there,
I need you, pal!

918
01:18:14.118 --> 01:18:15.267
Someone call my name?

919
01:18:17.146 --> 01:18:19.548
Theodore Roosevelt, at your service.

920
01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:21.740
Teddy, can you get us out of here?

921
01:18:21.844 --> 01:18:24.141
Can't do it, man. This is your moment.

922
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:26.856
Will you save the lectures, please?
I'm not you. Okay?

923
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.510
I didn't build the Panama Canal,
I wasn't president of the United States!

924
01:18:30.615 --> 01:18:31.867
I need some help. Come on.

925
01:18:31.972 --> 01:18:33.747
Actually...

926
01:18:35.835 --> 01:18:39.803
...I never did any of those things.
Teddy Roosevelt did.

927
01:18:40.012 --> 01:18:42.831
I was made in a mannequin factory
in Poughkeepsie.

928
01:18:43.144 --> 01:18:45.024
I never shot a wild beast.

929
01:18:45.128 --> 01:18:48.364
I'm not even brave enough to tell
that beautiful woman I love her.

930
01:18:48.587 --> 01:18:49.944
But you...

931
01:18:50.675 --> 01:18:54.224
...you gotta finish the job this time.
You can't quit.

932
01:18:56.939 --> 01:18:58.923
I'm made of wax, Larry.

933
01:18:59.445 --> 01:19:01.220
What are you made of?

934
01:19:05.787 --> 01:19:09.128
-Wait! That's all you got for me?
-That's it!

935
01:19:21.053 --> 01:19:23.037
That's it. Come on.

936
01:19:23.968 --> 01:19:25.325
Duck!

937
01:19:26.796 --> 01:19:28.362
Go over there!

938
01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:51.954
Hey. Hi. How you doing?
Sorry to bother you...

939
01:19:52.058 --> 01:19:54.355
...but your guys there? Your jackal guys?

940
01:19:54.564 --> 01:19:56.861
Do you think you could ask them
to back off, please?

941
01:19:57.070 --> 01:20:00.306
We're not trying to hurt you, they think
we are. Could you do it like now?

942
01:20:06.153 --> 01:20:08.763
Thank you. Nicky.

943
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:10.643
Thank you.

944
01:20:18.682 --> 01:20:19.913
Dad?

945
01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:33.926
You would not believe how stuffy
it is in there.

946
01:20:36.014 --> 01:20:39.042
-How come you speak English?
-I went to Cambridge University.

947
01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:40.295
You went to Cambridge?

948
01:20:40.504 --> 01:20:43.114
I was on display
in the Egyptology Department.

949
01:20:44.262 --> 01:20:46.768
I am Ahkmenrah, fourth king
of the fourth king...

950
01:20:46.977 --> 01:20:49.482
...ruler of the land of my fathers.

951
01:20:50.213 --> 01:20:52.406
I am Larry...

952
01:20:53.763 --> 01:20:55.642
...son of Milton...

953
01:20:55.747 --> 01:20:59.192
...and this is my son, Nick.

954
01:20:59.297 --> 01:21:01.803
And we hail from Brooklyn.

955
01:21:02.117 --> 01:21:05.458
Well, I do. I mean, he comes out and
stays with me on Wednesdays...

956
01:21:05.562 --> 01:21:06.815
...and every other weekend.

957
01:21:07.546 --> 01:21:11.826
That was the custody agreement
that we had.

958
01:21:12.348 --> 01:21:16.002
Larry, Nick, guardians of Brooklyn...

959
01:21:16.316 --> 01:21:18.195
...I am forever in your debt.

960
01:21:18.195 --> 01:21:20.805
Now bestow the tablet upon me...

961
01:21:21.014 --> 01:21:23.520
...so that I may assume command
of my kingdom.

962
01:21:24.459 --> 01:21:27.487
Oh, yes. Okay, the tablet. I would...

963
01:21:27.592 --> 01:21:31.037
...love to bestow it upon you,
but we don't actually...

964
01:21:31.159 --> 01:21:32.516
...have it.

965
01:21:40.761 --> 01:21:43.475
Thanks, guys. Don't worry.
I'll watch out for him!

966
01:21:43.684 --> 01:21:45.041
Thank you.

967
01:22:00.076 --> 01:22:01.746
What is that?

968
01:22:02.999 --> 01:22:04.670
Huns.

969
01:22:05.818 --> 01:22:07.593
I gotta deal with this guy.

970
01:22:44.245 --> 01:22:46.437
Pardon me, Larry. I speak Hun.

971
01:22:54.373 --> 01:22:56.253
He says that he wants to rip you apart.

972
01:22:56.461 --> 01:22:59.071
All right. Again with the ripping.
Listen, I understand.

973
01:22:59.176 --> 01:23:02.726
I get it. Ripping for you....
You want to rip things, okay?

974
01:23:02.934 --> 01:23:06.902
And I think maybe that's because
somebody ripped you a long time ago.

975
01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:08.781
In here.

976
01:23:09.512 --> 01:23:11.705
Somebody ripped little...

977
01:23:11.809 --> 01:23:14.732
...baby Attila a long time ago,
right here.

978
01:23:15.881 --> 01:23:19.326
They ripped something out,
didn't they?

979
01:23:21.205 --> 01:23:22.876
They ripped the love.

980
01:23:23.711 --> 01:23:26.009
They ripped the love right out of you,
didn't they?

981
01:23:26.844 --> 01:23:30.499
A little baby all alone in a tent...

982
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:33.526
...whose daddy went off...

983
01:23:34.257 --> 01:23:37.285
...to pillage some town...

984
01:23:37.389 --> 01:23:40.104
...or go and plunder somewhere,
just doing his job.

985
01:23:40.313 --> 01:23:42.401
But who was left alone?

986
01:23:45.846 --> 01:23:47.726
You.

987
01:23:52.946 --> 01:23:56.704
Let it out. Let it go.

988
01:24:17.282 --> 01:24:20.832
It's okay. It's okay.

989
01:24:22.398 --> 01:24:24.591
You're next.

990
01:24:28.454 --> 01:24:31.377
Good. That's good. Just breathe.

991
01:24:35.344 --> 01:24:36.702
-Larry Daley.
-Yeah.

992
01:24:40.461 --> 01:24:42.340
Good. Yes.

993
01:24:42.758 --> 01:24:44.637
Yeah. Okay. Good, good.

994
01:24:46.617 --> 01:24:49.436
All right!
I need everybody to listen up!

995
01:24:53.194 --> 01:24:54.656
Guys! Come on!

996
01:24:58.415 --> 01:25:04.783
Quiet!

997
01:25:14.498 --> 01:25:16.065
My dum-dum want to speak.

998
01:25:16.273 --> 01:25:18.048
Thank you.

999
01:25:18.883 --> 01:25:21.180
Now, this here's King Ahkmenrah.

1000
01:25:21.389 --> 01:25:24.208
His tablet is what brings you to life
every night.

1001
01:25:24.417 --> 01:25:27.236
And those old night watchmen?
They stole it.

1002
01:25:27.758 --> 01:25:30.368
Now, we need to find those guards
and get the tablet back...

1003
01:25:30.472 --> 01:25:32.352
...and we need to do it before morning.

1004
01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:35.693
Civil War guys,
head over to the Planetarium Wing.

1005
01:25:37.885 --> 01:25:40.704
My explorer friend
whose name escapes me.

1006
01:25:40.913 --> 01:25:44.254
-It's Columbus.
-Right, Columbus! Right, I'm sorry.

1007
01:25:44.463 --> 01:25:47.177
There's no nameplate, so....
Columbus, take the Neanderthals...

1008
01:25:47.386 --> 01:25:50.310
...and do a sweep from lnvertebrates
all the way through Reptiles.

1009
01:25:50.519 --> 01:25:53.547
Jed and Octavius, their van's parked
out back. Go take care of it.

1010
01:25:53.652 --> 01:25:56.784
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!
No, sir. I ain't working with toga boy.

1011
01:25:56.993 --> 01:25:58.663
Romans work alone.

1012
01:25:59.394 --> 01:26:01.482
-That didn't hurt. Don't be a baby.
-Yes, it did.

1013
01:26:01.691 --> 01:26:02.944
Come on.

1014
01:26:03.466 --> 01:26:05.136
That was much harder!

1015
01:26:05.345 --> 01:26:06.807
Guys, come on!

1016
01:26:07.642 --> 01:26:09.730
Jed, Octavius.

1017
01:26:09.939 --> 01:26:12.236
Take away the fact you were born
2000 years apart...

1018
01:26:12.445 --> 01:26:13.906
...you guys aren't that different.

1019
01:26:14.533 --> 01:26:16.725
You're both great leaders.

1020
01:26:16.725 --> 01:26:19.022
You just want what's best
for your people, right?

1021
01:26:19.231 --> 01:26:20.693
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1022
01:26:20.901 --> 01:26:22.363
Civil War dudes.

1023
01:26:24.138 --> 01:26:28.942
You guys are brothers, for God's sakes.
You gotta stop fighting.

1024
01:26:29.359 --> 01:26:33.640
North wins. Slavery's bad. Sorry.

1025
01:26:33.849 --> 01:26:39.278
Don't wanna burst your bubble.
But, South, you guys get Allman Brothers...

1026
01:26:40.009 --> 01:26:43.036
...and NASCAR, so just chill!

1027
01:26:44.394 --> 01:26:48.674
Look, without that tablet,
all of this...

1028
01:26:48.883 --> 01:26:52.537
...this whole coming-to-life-at-night thing,
it all goes away.

1029
01:26:52.746 --> 01:26:55.878
Now, I don't wanna let that happen,
but I need your help.

1030
01:26:56.087 --> 01:26:58.384
We can get this done,
but we gotta do it together.

1031
01:26:59.637 --> 01:27:00.890
So who's with me?

1032
01:27:02.143 --> 01:27:03.814
Yeah.

1033
01:27:04.023 --> 01:27:05.902
-Who's with me?
-Yeah!

1034
01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:08.617
-Yeah!
-Charge!

1035
01:27:09.578 --> 01:27:12.502
All right! Now, let's do this, people!

1036
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:16.147
And animals!

1037
01:27:18.027 --> 01:27:21.681
And weird, faceless puppet creatures.
Come on, let's go! Let's do it!

1038
01:27:44.751 --> 01:27:46.735
Come on! Follow me, boys!

1039
01:27:46.839 --> 01:27:48.510
Geronimo!

1040
01:28:00.307 --> 01:28:02.187
Oh, jeez.

1041
01:28:16.178 --> 01:28:20.354
Now, boys, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

1042
01:28:25.888 --> 01:28:28.185
I guess it's gonna be the hard way.

1043
01:28:32.048 --> 01:28:35.806
Right, men, we're almost there.

1044
01:28:55.962 --> 01:28:58.155
Save yourself!

1045
01:28:58.363 --> 01:29:00.347
I ain't quitting you!

1046
01:29:02.226 --> 01:29:03.792
Gus?

1047
01:29:06.089 --> 01:29:07.342
Reginald?

1048
01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.535
Fellas, where are you?

1049
01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:12.458
Guys?

1050
01:29:23.003 --> 01:29:26.553
That's what I'm talking about.
Good job, gentlemen.

1051
01:29:26.657 --> 01:29:28.224
Loving the teamwork!

1052
01:29:48.575 --> 01:29:52.020
They've vanished.
How will we find them?

1053
01:29:52.634 --> 01:29:54.952
I know someone who can help. Come on.

1054
01:29:55.996 --> 01:29:57.876
Watch out!

1055
01:30:04.354 --> 01:30:08.217
Hey, Sakagawea, or wea. Listen,
I need a favor. Somebody stole his tablet.

1056
01:30:08.530 --> 01:30:10.932
You think you can track the guys
who took it?

1057
01:30:11.663 --> 01:30:15.839
He went east
but he lost control and crashed.

1058
01:30:16.365 --> 01:30:19.393
You're amazing. How can you tell that?

1059
01:30:23.569 --> 01:30:25.553
He left the wagon...

1060
01:30:25.657 --> 01:30:27.537
...and went back.

1061
01:30:27.641 --> 01:30:29.416
He went back?

1062
01:30:30.773 --> 01:30:32.130
Why would he go back?

1063
01:30:35.054 --> 01:30:36.411
Get out of the way!

1064
01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:46.122
You saved me.

1065
01:30:46.539 --> 01:30:48.628
You're worth saving, my dear.

1066
01:30:50.924 --> 01:30:53.535
-That's problematic.
-Teddy. Oh, man.

1067
01:30:53.743 --> 01:30:55.936
Larry, relax. I'm wax.

1068
01:30:56.145 --> 01:30:58.024
You gotta do something.
Dawn's approaching.

1069
01:30:58.233 --> 01:31:01.574
-Half the museum's running amuck outside.
-He's got my tablet.

1070
01:31:04.288 --> 01:31:06.376
Come on, Ockie!

1071
01:31:12.432 --> 01:31:14.311
At your service, Gigantor!

1072
01:31:14.416 --> 01:31:16.609
How can we be of assistance, my liege?

1073
01:31:16.818 --> 01:31:19.011
Just give me a second, guys.

1074
01:31:23.187 --> 01:31:24.857
Rexy?

1075
01:31:26.319 --> 01:31:27.572
Here, boy.

1076
01:31:27.676 --> 01:31:29.973
Teddy, I need a horse.

1077
01:31:30.078 --> 01:31:31.748
Do it, man.

1078
01:31:46.882 --> 01:31:50.537
-Come on, boy! Let me hear you yell!
-Yeah!

1079
01:31:50.745 --> 01:31:52.625
Just living the dream, baby!

1080
01:31:52.835 --> 01:31:54.401
I'm loving this!

1081
01:31:58.055 --> 01:32:00.247
Pull the stagecoach over now!

1082
01:32:03.066 --> 01:32:04.632
Can I make this turn up here?

1083
01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:09.853
I'll take that as a yes. Hang on!

1084
01:32:16.326 --> 01:32:18.205
I can't hold it!

1085
01:32:31.470 --> 01:32:33.141
Come on, Tex, let's finish this.

1086
01:32:34.707 --> 01:32:36.377
Come on!

1087
01:32:41.284 --> 01:32:42.955
Give me the tablet, Cecil!

1088
01:32:43.064 --> 01:32:44.525
Can't do it, son.

1089
01:32:47.971 --> 01:32:49.432
Pull over!

1090
01:32:49.637 --> 01:32:52.769
It ain't gonna happen. Moving on.

1091
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.214
Last chance, Cecil.
Stop the horses or I will!

1092
01:32:56.423 --> 01:32:58.302
They can't be stopped, Larry.

1093
01:32:58.511 --> 01:33:00.182
Don't you know your history?

1094
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:05.403
These are money carriers. They were trained
not to stop for anything but a secret word.

1095
01:33:05.612 --> 01:33:07.595
Really? You mean a word like...

1096
01:33:08.722 --> 01:33:10.414
..." Dakota"?

1097
01:33:15.113 --> 01:33:16.470
Come on, Tex.

1098
01:33:20.351 --> 01:33:22.647
I read up on my history.
Thanks for the tip.

1099
01:33:23.265 --> 01:33:24.518
Oh, and by the way...

1100
01:33:24.727 --> 01:33:27.485
...don't ever talk to me like that
in front of my son.

1101
01:33:29.334 --> 01:33:31.004
Moving on.

1102
01:33:35.372 --> 01:33:37.251
-Hey, Huns.
-Tell Attila to have his boys...

1103
01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:39.444
...take him back.
Put him with the guards.

1104
01:33:42.681 --> 01:33:45.396
Oh, and no limb ripping, okay?

1105
01:33:59.177 --> 01:34:00.848
Hey, boy. Wait, wait, hold the phone.

1106
01:34:01.057 --> 01:34:05.128
What's makeekaka mean?
Wait. Translation, please.

1107
01:34:06.903 --> 01:34:10.871
The year was 1909. I was going up
the Zambezi River in Africa.

1108
01:34:10.975 --> 01:34:14.107
And our river guide was a brilliant Pygmy
who spoke only by clicking.

1109
01:34:22.147 --> 01:34:23.505
There we are.

1110
01:34:27.163 --> 01:34:29.043
-Oh, boy.
-What is it?

1111
01:34:29.251 --> 01:34:31.340
I gotta get you guys
back to the museum.

1112
01:34:33.114 --> 01:34:34.367
How?

1113
01:34:37.082 --> 01:34:39.483
Ahkmenrah, I'm gonna need your help.

1114
01:34:39.588 --> 01:34:42.824
This is your tablet. You know
the instructions. You get everyone back.

1115
01:35:10.815 --> 01:35:13.738
Come on. There's somebody
who's gotta see this.

1116
01:35:16.239 --> 01:35:19.580
What I'm saying is, for the type of money
that they pay A-Rod...

1117
01:35:19.789 --> 01:35:23.026
...he ought to be bringing home
a World Series trophy every season.

1118
01:35:23.548 --> 01:35:25.218
You know what I mean?

1119
01:35:43.699 --> 01:35:46.309
Now, who they gonna get
to clean up all that doo-doo?

1120
01:35:46.518 --> 01:35:47.667
-lnuit.
-Yeah.

1121
01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.546
One terracotta soldier.

1122
01:35:49.650 --> 01:35:50.903
-Vikings.
-Right.

1123
01:35:51.008 --> 01:35:52.991
-Alpaca.
-Welcome back, ladies.

1124
01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:54.766
-Llama.
-Hey.

1125
01:35:54.975 --> 01:35:56.332
Viking guys.

1126
01:35:56.437 --> 01:35:58.942
Do me a favor. Your fellows
made some funeral pyre...

1127
01:35:59.151 --> 01:36:01.239
...in Petrified Wood. Go clean that up.

1128
01:36:01.552 --> 01:36:02.910
Okay? Thank you.

1129
01:36:04.371 --> 01:36:06.983
-He's back.
-All right, I'll deal with this joker.

1130
01:36:07.191 --> 01:36:10.324
Hey, hey, Moose.
It's not gonna happen, buddy. All right?

1131
01:36:10.532 --> 01:36:12.828
I told you, you can't come through
with those antlers.

1132
01:36:12.829 --> 01:36:15.961
So you and your caribou buddy
gotta go around to the loading dock.

1133
01:36:16.066 --> 01:36:18.780
-Lawrence!
-Hey, Teddy.

1134
01:36:19.511 --> 01:36:21.077
Great to see you in one piece.

1135
01:36:21.286 --> 01:36:23.687
Sakagawea, a little hot wax,
and I'm a new man.

1136
01:36:23.896 --> 01:36:25.567
Larry?

1137
01:36:30.161 --> 01:36:32.458
I told you I wasn't making fun of you.

1138
01:36:32.562 --> 01:36:35.277
-I know.
-Teddy?

1139
01:36:36.738 --> 01:36:39.975
Oh, my God.

1140
01:36:40.706 --> 01:36:42.480
Wanna meet her?

1141
01:36:44.256 --> 01:36:45.405
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1142
01:36:45.614 --> 01:36:46.762
Okay, come on.

1143
01:36:46.971 --> 01:36:50.103
Excuse me. President Roosevelt,
this is my friend Rebecca.

1144
01:36:50.312 --> 01:36:51.982
-An honor.
-Hi.

1145
01:36:52.191 --> 01:36:54.071
And this is Sakagawea.

1146
01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:55.428
-Wea.
-Wea.

1147
01:36:55.537 --> 01:36:56.704
Wea.

1148
01:36:57.103 --> 01:37:00.026
I think she has a few questions
she wants to ask you.

1149
01:37:01.801 --> 01:37:03.993
You rock. I am a big fan.

1150
01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:07.026
What would you like to know?

1151
01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:10.880
Well, I mean,
I don't know where to start, but....

1152
01:37:22.061 --> 01:37:24.567
-One Buddha.
-Check.

1153
01:37:26.133 --> 01:37:28.534
Two zebras.

1154
01:37:29.161 --> 01:37:32.502
-Right. Check.
-Dexter! Welcome back.

1155
01:37:32.710 --> 01:37:35.529
Hey, Dex, so look.
No hard feelings, all right?

1156
01:37:37.095 --> 01:37:38.662
-Lawrence!
-You saw!

1157
01:37:38.766 --> 01:37:41.063
-You saw what he did just then!
-Who's evolved?

1158
01:37:41.376 --> 01:37:43.151
-I am.
-Who's evolved?

1159
01:37:43.255 --> 01:37:44.613
I am!

1160
01:37:45.657 --> 01:37:47.014
Good.

1161
01:37:47.745 --> 01:37:49.207
Well, they're all here.

1162
01:37:49.415 --> 01:37:50.877
Well done. Everyone's in.

1163
01:37:51.086 --> 01:37:52.756
Yeah, well...

1164
01:37:52.965 --> 01:37:54.740
...not everyone.

1165
01:37:55.889 --> 01:37:58.917
We lost a couple of good, little men
out there tonight.

1166
01:37:59.335 --> 01:38:03.302
With great victory comes great sacrifice.

1167
01:38:04.242 --> 01:38:05.808
Yeah.

1168
01:38:08.736 --> 01:38:10.615
Dad, look.

1169
01:38:16.462 --> 01:38:18.446
Bully!

1170
01:38:39.128 --> 01:38:41.529
You ain't getting rid of us that easy.

1171
01:39:01.888 --> 01:39:03.559
Until tomorrow evening, Lawrence?

1172
01:39:04.185 --> 01:39:06.482
Yeah. I don't know about that, Teddy.

1173
01:39:07.214 --> 01:39:09.511
It's gonna be tough
to talk my way out of this one.

1174
01:39:09.515 --> 01:39:11.603
Well, if that's indeed the case...

1175
01:39:11.812 --> 01:39:13.691
...then it's farewell, my friend.

1176
01:39:15.871 --> 01:39:17.541
Nick?

1177
01:39:18.490 --> 01:39:20.369
Your father's a great man.

1178
01:39:20.891 --> 01:39:22.457
I know.

1179
01:39:28.208 --> 01:39:29.879
Told you.

1180
01:39:33.324 --> 01:39:35.308
All right. Good night.

1181
01:39:35.412 --> 01:39:38.335
No, Lawrence. Good day.

1182
01:39:43.548 --> 01:39:45.427
Hey, Teddy?

1183
01:39:58.791 --> 01:40:00.357
Thanks.

1184
01:40:13.934 --> 01:40:17.171
You're watching New York 1.
News all morning.

1185
01:40:18.528 --> 01:40:21.035
Thanks for joining us.
There is a fresh blanket of snow.

1186
01:40:21.244 --> 01:40:23.645
But it's not the snow
that's got New Yorkers talking.

1187
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:27.926
It's what's in the snow. There are
dinosaur tracks along West 81st Street.

1188
01:40:28.552 --> 01:40:31.893
Here's the remarkable video. These appear
to be Tyrannosaurus Rex tracks...

1189
01:40:32.102 --> 01:40:35.130
...and they lead straight
to the Museum of Natural History.

1190
01:40:35.652 --> 01:40:39.724
Authorities have found what appear to be
cave drawings in the subway.

1191
01:40:40.037 --> 01:40:43.169
Neanderthals atop the museum roof.
Elaborate hoax or publicity stunt?

1192
01:40:44.735 --> 01:40:46.614
You be the judge,
but one thing's for sure:

1193
01:40:46.614 --> 01:40:50.269
The folks at the Natural History Museum
have really outdone them--

1194
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:54.762
Any explanation at all?

1195
01:40:59.148 --> 01:41:00.819
No. Got nothing.

1196
01:41:01.028 --> 01:41:02.281
Good.

1197
01:41:02.803 --> 01:41:05.517
I'll take your keys and your flashlight.

1198
01:41:23.579 --> 01:41:25.667
Folks, this way.

1199
01:42:23.406 --> 01:42:27.373
My name is Nick Daley.
My Career Day parent is my dad.

1200
01:42:27.582 --> 01:42:30.714
He's the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1201
01:42:35.726 --> 01:42:37.709
Hey, how's it going? Well, Nicky said it:

1202
01:42:37.814 --> 01:42:40.320
I'm the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1203
01:42:40.528 --> 01:42:44.496
Let me tell you something:
That's when history comes alive.

1204
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:48.360
How many of you guys
have been over to the museum?

1205
01:43:09.136 --> 01:43:12.582
Goal!

1206
01:43:39.624 --> 01:43:42.025
Hey, it's getting late.
Are you ready to go home?

1207
01:43:42.756 --> 01:43:43.696
Nope.

1208
01:43:50.273 --> 01:43:51.839
Let's ride.

1209
01:44:29.426 --> 01:44:32.767
It was nice of Larry not to rat us out,
but this is ridiculous.

1210
01:44:32.872 --> 01:44:35.901
We're night watchmen, not janitors!

1211
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:37.884
Gentlemen, you're doing a terrific job.

1212
01:44:37.989 --> 01:44:39.450
I'll gonna catch a few Z's.

1213
01:44:39.659 --> 01:44:41.121
You ain't going nowhere.

1214
01:44:41.225 --> 01:44:43.940
Start mopping, hot dog.

1215
01:44:48.325 --> 01:44:49.995
Over here.

1216
01:44:50.019 --> 01:44:52.019
