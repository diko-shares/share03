1
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,232
Edmond has become gripped by the idea

2
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,188
that it was no accident, but suicide.

3
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,188
Caused by despair. Or <i>as</i> a punishment.

4
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,193
His wife and his daughter

5
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,226
lost their lives in a car crash.

6
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,385
Edmond had argued with Monika

7
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,405
about separation. They had traded
insults, accusations, threats etc..

8
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,231
Edmond always closes his eyes

9
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,129
when he thinks about it.

10
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,202
No other vehicle was involved,

11
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,335
the motorway was almost empty.

12
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,297
And yet the car sped through a barrier

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,180
and plunged into the gorge.

14
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,379
His wife and Kiki, his daughter,

15
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,323
were almost unrecognisable.

16
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,148
Edmond continues to run his business.

17
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,159
But as evening settles in,
so does the desperation.

18
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,356
He rarely goes home anymore...

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,185
What's there for him?

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,242
No one is waiting for him,

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,411
no child will jump into his arms
and hug him.

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,387
In old age, when one has lived his life,

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,616
he is entitled to

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,306
befriend death in silence.

25
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,199
He doesn't need people anymore,
he's seen enough of them.

26
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,239
He has only need of silence.

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,342
It's not appropriate to visit
such a person.

28
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,323
To address him,
to torment him with prattle.

29
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,364
Rather, it is fitting
to <i>pass</i> the door of his dwelling

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,169
as if it were the house of no one.

31
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,199
Those are the words
of an old Chinese poet.

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,124
<i>Meng Xie</i>

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,345
<i>or Meng Xiao.</i>

34
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,377
You know, we're both at an age
in which it is fitting

35
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,371
to occupy ourselves with death,
or departure, however you might put it.

36
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,222
Or... is it too soon for you?

37
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,211
If you think of the life
that you have before you...

38
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,229
What life'?

39
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,117
Yes, I understand.

40
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,188
How long have the two of them
been dead?

41
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,345
How long?

42
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,157
I can't remember.

43
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,297
Your child... she was always
so joyful. Howl loved her.

44
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,289
I once wanted to stroke her head...

45
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,289
and she bit me in the hand.

46
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,297
You know, there's a house...

47
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,161
a 'maison'.

48
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,197
A kind of

49
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,265
meditational...

50
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,288
You should go there sometime.

51
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,115
But Why?

52
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,239
Just try it.
Trust me, go there.

53
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,277
It would do you good.

54
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,280
No wish, no words
could ever bring you back.

55
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,309
Farewell, then!

56
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,279
Torn from you, alone, forsaken,
and filled with pain...

57
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,294
no death could be more bitter.

58
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,317
She bit him in the hand.

59
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,208
Yes, that was your Kiki!

60
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,299
And please don't play
any wicked pranks

61
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,335
like sticking your finger
in the girl's mouth. It is forbidden.

62
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,282
Come along!

63
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,398
And please don't try to wake the girl,
<i>as</i> her eyes shall not open.

64
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,260
Whatever you do,
the girl will sleep through it.

65
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,239
And when she awakes she will
know nothing of what has happened,

66
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,130
not even who was sleeping beside her.

67
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,243
So you needn't have
any worries about that.

68
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,386
What time is it?
...Quarter past eleven.

69
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,317
Then it's time.
The older gentlemen who come here

70
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,232
tend to go to bed early.
And they're the first to get up.

71
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,317
So, if you would care to...

72
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,312
She is a very pretty girl,
and we consider it important

73
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,311
to receive only guests
whom we can trust.

74
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,235
What is it?

75
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,219
There are two sleeping pills
on the table, in case you can't sleep.

76
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,329
Do you serve drinks?
A glass of wine, perhaps?

77
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,334
No, we do not serve
any alcoholic drinks.

78
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,238
Not even a nightcap?
...I'm terribly sorry.

79
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,322
So the girl is lying in that room?

80
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,283
She's sound asleep
and is waiting for you.

81
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,239
Would you prefer to disrobe here,
or in there? Perhaps I could assist?

82
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,151
No, thanks. I'll undress myself.

83
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,315
Here...

84
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,391
Take this.
You'll find you will need it.

85
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,191
I wish you a pleasant sleep.

86
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,135
Good night.

87
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,215
Toads...

88
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,301
Black dogs and drowned corpses...

89
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,210
That's what the night
holds in store for me.

90
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,135
How does it go, that poem by...

91
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,381
He was a young poet, a Romantic.

92
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,271
He died at a young age.

93
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,254
The little one...

94
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,406
The woman's skin is probably
disfigured by the narcotics...

95
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,345
leaden and drab.

96
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,280
Dark-ringed eyes, her face
emaciated and hideously sunken.

97
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,380
Or she is fat and bloated?

98
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,294
Perhaps she snores...

99
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,215
and has repugnant blue-flecked gums.

100
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,345
You're not really asleep.

101
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,339
You're awake, aren't you?

102
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,327
Well?

103
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,243
My old friend Kogi
told me about this place.

104
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,292
He said...

105
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,399
It seems to me that I gave up
women as women years ago.

106
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,266
But there are people there
who prepare a young woman for you

107
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,353
in such a way
that she sleeps and doesn't wake up.

108
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,323
I would never have believed
what my friend Kogi told me.

109
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,404
I never thought
that would ever do this.

110
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,248
And now I'm here.

111
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,187
I scarcely dare to breathe.

112
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,117
Kogi said...

113
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,279
I only feel really alive
when lying beside a somnolent...

114
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,365
beside a sleeping young woman.

115
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,169
Maybe there are old men,

116
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,271
men like Kogi,

117
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,186
who caress such a young woman,

118
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,310
touch her all over,

119
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,174
without conscience.

120
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,277
It seems to me

121
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,277
that I gave up women as women years ago.

122
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,185
But then, I am not as old

123
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,315
as Kogi.

124
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,248
Not nearly so old.

125
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,134
You smell of milk.

126
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,382
It is the milky scent of a child
that is still weaning.

127
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,117
That's impossible.

128
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,192
If you had a child,
your breast would be swollen,

129
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,146
And milk would seep from your nipples.

130
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,339
I'd be able to taste it.

131
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,305
No, you are too young.

132
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,134
You don't have a child yet.

133
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,214
But it is your scent...

134
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,197
This scent, it...

135
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,242
What does this scent remind me of'?

136
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,258
Of my mother.

137
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,151
Yes, perhaps.

138
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,153
But can one still remember that...

139
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,339
after more than 60 years?

140
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,187
Can you not be awoken at all?

141
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,203
To sleep...

142
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,170
doesn't mean to sleep for ever.

143
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,170
Neither for her, nor for me.

144
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,305
Turn over, towards me.

145
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,128
Are you dreaming?

146
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,140
Say something!

147
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,198
Two weeks later

148
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,385
I paid you a visit two weeks ago.

149
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,199
May I come again this evening? Now?

150
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,319
If you leave now,
at what time could you be here?

151
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,295
At around... nine o'clock.

152
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,379
No, that's too early. I'm sorry.

153
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,358
The girl hasn't arrived yet,
and she can't fall asleep so quickly.

154
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,322
I could have her asleep by eleven.

155
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,316
I shall expect you at that time.

156
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,170
Very well, I shall come then.

157
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,247
See you tomorrow.

158
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,162
The meeting is at 11.

159
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,259
Mr Gold is waiting downstairs.

160
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,321
Thank you, Gold.

161
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,199
I find it's turned rather cold.
Keep yourself warmly covered.

162
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,323
The girl tonight is more experienced
than the one last time.

163
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,212
What? Yes, but...

164
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,263
She is just as pretty,
but don't do anything stupid.

165
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,157
What?

166
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,180
A different girl?

167
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,218
Yes, tonight's girl...
ls not acceptable to you?

168
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,220
Well...

169
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,198
I'm not so...
...excessive?

170
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,405
But you're not doing anything
one might call excessive...

171
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,321
Are you?

172
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,288
Or are you perhaps
one of those lechers?

173
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,344
Was I perhaps mistaken about you?

174
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,206
Well, whatever you consider excessive,
the girl sleeps and remembers nothing.

175
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,188
But since you
liked the last girl so much,

176
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,295
I shall send her to sleep
the next time you come.

177
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,232
But I'm sure you'll say
that tonight's girl was even better.

178
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,248
You say she's more experienced?

179
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,171
What does that mean? She just sleeps!

180
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,317
Ah, what do you know?

181
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,276
Here, undress yourself now.

182
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,214
And sleep well.

183
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,207
More experienced...

184
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,158
Experienced...

185
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,357
Does that mean better?

186
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,175
I want to look into your eyes.

187
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,135
Blue.

188
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,350
You remind me of someone.

189
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,271
But of whom'?

190
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,368
You can't deceive me.

191
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,179
You're still virginal.

192
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,254
What are you doing here?

193
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,151
Why?

194
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,275
Oh well...

195
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,299
In the end, she's just a prostitute.

196
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,357
A little whore.

197
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,288
But... so young.

198
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,248
Mama!

199
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,254
I only did it...

200
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,339
What are you doing?

201
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,366
I don't want to!

202
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,134
What am I doing to you, then?

203
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,197
Tell me, child.

204
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,310
I only ran away because...

205
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,205
Is it over,
the dream about your mother?

206
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,297
Say something!

207
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,351
No!

208
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,340
When an old man
caresses a girl like this,

209
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,204
it is lamentation, nothing more.

210
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,294
Pah, lamentation!

211
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,332
Arousal!

212
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,282
We make love...

213
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,159
She brushes the tousled hair
from my brow...

214
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,176
with her hands so wonderful!

215
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,180
Good morning!

216
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,214
Are you awake already?

217
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,322
Yes, I'm up.

218
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,225
I'm just dressing.

219
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,203
You must get up now, sir!

220
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,151
So, how was it?

221
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,340
She's a lovely girl, don't you agree?

222
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,347
Yes, a lovely girl. That's true.

223
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,342
And when will she wake up?
...Yes... when?

224
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,152
Can I wait until she wakes?
...Out of the question!

225
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,300
We don't even allow our
most senior guest do that.

226
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,259
I like her so much that I...

227
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,238
It's better not to develop any
futile emotions, don't you think?

228
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,330
You spent the night with her;
all else need not interest you.

229
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:53,417
She has no idea that you slept
beside her. You shan't be at risk.

230
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,151
Yes... I understand.

231
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,385
But what if I were to
meet the girl on the street...

232
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,207
What?

233
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,265
You'd want to talk to hen'?

234
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,309
Please do not do that.
I feel it would be a crime.

235
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,286
It is absolutely against the law.
The law of this establishment.

236
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,201
A crime?

237
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,386
Against the laws of this establishment?
...Yes, it would be.

238
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,199
I ask you not to entertain such ideas.
Simply take her for what she is:

239
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,216
a sleeping girl.
And let that be enough.

240
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,347
Madame, please tell me...
...There's no more to say. Please go.

241
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,235
You...

242
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,282
You make the laws?

243
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,328
Would you please leave?

244
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,186
He is not a man
who is living at peace with himself.

245
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,226
No, he's a beaten, frightened man.

246
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,446
Is he perhaps afraid of approaching
death? Or is it the desperation

247
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:36,281
of not having reciprocated the
passionate devotion of a loved one?

248
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,225
What is driving him?

249
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,199
How's your family and the children,
Mr Gold? Everything fine?

250
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,353
Everything's fine, boss.
The children are never a problem.

251
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,353
Maybe I'm the problem. My wife says,
"Why do you drive for him?"

252
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,199
Yes, you! "There are better,
more important things to do.

253
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,376
Kill him, take his money!"
"Sure," I say to her,

254
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,238
<i>"I'll</i> kill him. And what then?"

255
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,153
Why should I kill'?

256
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,235
Mr Gold,

257
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,175
do you need money?

258
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,367
Ah, boss... Women!

259
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,235
Fine.

260
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,311
There was once a man

261
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,313
who followed one of these girls,
or he believed it was one of them.

262
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:07,199
He went after her, and she became
afraid. By the river, he was so close

263
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,279
that he grabbed for her,
thinking she wanted to jump in.

264
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,228
She dragged him
into the water with her.

265
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,280
The next day,
they were found drowned,

266
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,248
entangled together like lovers
in a passionate clinch.

267
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,296
When I started here,
his wife had been dead for some time.

268
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,327
It's as if he lives in a garden
full of snow, ringed by high walls.

269
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,265
No bird ventures to fly in.

270
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,312
Four clays later

271
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,232
Thank you, Gold. Goodbye.
...Shall I wait'?

272
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,266
No, you can go. See you tomorrow.

273
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,218
Here I am.

274
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,127
May I help you?

275
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,363
I want...
Aren't you going to let me in?

276
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,175
I think you have the wrong house.
Good night, sir.

277
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,321
Madame!

278
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,352
Be she a housewife,
a schoolgirl, or a marquise...

279
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,364
he can get his leg over with
this one and that. It's cheap, too!

280
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,428
Look how the trash creeps
over the city. See the blind ones,

281
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,202
this stinking city,

282
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,347
these dissolute children.
Who could live like this?

283
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,290
But the Lord's hand will come,
it will point the way to the light.

284
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:20,170
It will point the way to the light.

285
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,345
You're here already, sin'?

286
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,356
Be so kind and make me a cup of tea.

287
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,239
But of course. You're always welcome.

288
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,208
No, today's not possible.

289
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,151
No, tomorrow neither.

290
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,231
She wouldn't receive me...

291
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,276
She wouldn't let me in.
It was as if she didn't even know me.

292
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,279
What does it mean?
...I don't know. Women!

293
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,339
I called her today.

294
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,158
"It's not possible today," she said.

295
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,221
"No, tomorrow neither."
...Women.

296
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,341
Maybe she has a plan.
...What kind of plan, Kogi?

297
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,333
What do we know about women?

298
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,354
Maybe she doesn't like
you constantly asking questions.

299
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,279
This woman has a past, for certain.
I wouldn't go back there.

300
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,318
You recommended it yourself!
...Yes

301
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,267
But things change.
I wouldn't go back there again.

302
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,350
Believe me.

303
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,249
One week later

304
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,214
Tonight's girl is a trainee.

305
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,422
It's possible you won't like her.
But try to get along with her.

306
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,281
A different girl?

307
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:02,280
Since you were already leaving when
you called, I asked her to stand in.

308
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,279
If you require a specific girl,
you must notify me beforehand.

309
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,274
I understand.
But what do you mean by "trainee"?

310
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,389
She's new. A young thing.
It's unfamiliar, so she's afraid.

311
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,422
She wanted someone to go with her.
I said no. The guest don't like it.

312
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,379
What, two at once?

313
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,279
Well... it wouldn't be
altogether unpleasant for a man.

314
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,170
You think so? Tut-tut!

315
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,315
It doesn't matter.

316
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,193
She's lying there like the dead,
so she shan't know what happens.

317
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,273
Of course not.
But treat her gently, nonetheless.

318
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,378
She's not used to it yet.
...I won't harm her.

319
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,321
I know that.

320
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,239
Why did you turn me away last week?
...She's sleeping, go in!

321
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,279
Why did you humiliate me like that?
...I had no choice.

322
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,306
Furthermore, I knew you'd come back.

323
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,221
Who is this curious madame?

324
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,158
I sometimes think
she is a bringer of death.

325
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,147
Perhaps my own...

326
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,208
<i>'(our tea.</i>

327
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,258
Don't you want any?

328
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,237
No, thank you.

329
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,321
What are you waiting for?

330
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,311
You may begin.

331
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,161
Soon.

332
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,355
When you've left.

333
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,404
You think I'd want to watch?
No, no. I'm going now.

334
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,263
Can you help me into my coat?

335
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,275
Thank you.

336
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,271
I'll be going, then.

337
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,345
Have a pleasant night.

338
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,332
Do you know when you'll come again?
Oh, pardon me. I'm going.

339
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,288
Wouldn't it be better if I left?

340
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,404
Am I not like all the other
old men here, who just want

341
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,286
to suck new youth
out of these sleeping beauties?

342
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,193
To enjoy women

343
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,404
who'd never even glance at them
if they were awake.

344
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,220
Am I already such a wretch?

345
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,318
My daughter
wouldn't be any older than you now.

346
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,299
What do they give you?

347
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,155
What?

348
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,127
Madame!

349
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,298
Are you still here?

350
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:23,383
Nothing is more beautiful than
the innocent face of a sleeping girl.

351
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:31,319
No woman, no matter how beautiful,
can banish the years from her face.

352
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,357
The sleeping face of a girl

353
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,239
looks beautiful
even if she is not so pretty.

354
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,135
To sleep like the dead.

355
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,294
Like the dead...

356
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,226
If I were to squeeze now,

357
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,278
you wouldn't even notice.

358
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,252
How strange

359
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,187
that such a young girl,

360
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,296
one still learning
to be a 'sleeping beauty',

361
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,192
should remind me so much of a woman.

362
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,162
Where was it...

363
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,123
In Hamburg, yes.

364
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,254
We were in a hotel, you know?

365
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,323
And when she awoke in the morning,
she said

366
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,209
she had slept like the dead.

367
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,168
I told her

368
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,363
that she'd seemed
very much alive to me.

369
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,159
Then she understood.

370
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,310
And on that morning at dawn,

371
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,181
we re-lived the entire night.

372
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,296
Then she told me
that she was going to marry...

373
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,191
and quickly got dressed.

374
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,324
Sleep is something that is
enigmatic, mysterious,

375
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,243
terrifying... like death.

376
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,208
Should I spare a thought for it,

377
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,213
or simply brush aside
that which is... inevitable?

378
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,270
<i>SW?</i>

379
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,281
Sir!

380
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,241
Wake up!

381
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,265
It's time!

382
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,138
Wake up!

383
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,157
You'll catch a cold.

384
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,356
Didn't you hear me calling last night?

385
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,199
I'd like to be given the sleeping
drug, so I may sleep as they do.

386
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,306
That is strictly forbidden,
as I have told you.

387
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,253
It's dangerous for older people.

388
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,256
Even if I didn't wake up again,
I'd never regret it.

389
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,361
It's only your third visit here,

390
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,334
and already you're saying
such capricious things.

391
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:06,217
What are the limits of permitted
capriciousness in this house?

392
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,227
You old lecher!

393
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,170
What are you thinking about?

394
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,180
<i>“' 8 You'?</i>

395
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,315
I'm sorry,
I

396
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,370
Mr Kogmann is not here.
...Nonsense! He must be here.

397
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,163
Yes, but he cannot receive you.

398
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,314
Tell Kogi... Mr Kogmann...
Is he unwell?

399
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,196
Be careful.

400
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,271
Why did she say

401
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,219
that I should be careful?

402
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,246
And why was she crying?
...Ah, boss, women...

403
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,259
Be quiet, Gold.

404
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,161
Green!

405
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,323
Slowly now. Shall I help you?
...No. I can manage.

406
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,256
I'm not so old
that I need to be led by the hand.

407
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,239
I just wanted to help you.
...Do you also have guest,

408
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,254
half-crippled and senile idiots,

409
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,332
who wouldn't make it up the stairs
without your help?

410
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,220
You shouldn't ask me
about other guest. You know that.

411
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,403
It must be dangerous for old men
in such weather.

412
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,403
What do you do
if one has a stroke or a heart attack?

413
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,355
Should that happen...

414
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,233
then the guest would
have a pleasant passage to paradise.

415
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,279
Don't get cynical now.
But you wouldn't get away with it

416
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,241
so easily, am I right?
...Well, don't give it too much thought.

417
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,294
You always call so suddenly.

418
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:30,337
Did you not like any of the girls?
...No, I liked them all.

419
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,344
I mean it quite sincerely. Honestly.

420
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,273
If that's the case,
you might call a few days in advance

421
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,251
to let me know which of the girls
I should prepare for you.

422
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:46,159
You made it clear
that it only leads to complications

423
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:51,371
if a guest becomes too fixated
on one girl... Yes, I did.

424
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,115
So?

425
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,335
And what if I were the man
you wished for,

426
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,313
and I came to this establishment?
What would you think of me?

427
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,279
What are your usual guests like?
Horny old men

428
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,342
who long to be with women again.
With sexy women!

429
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,181
You know more than I do.

430
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:24,405
Then tell me, what is the most
evil thing an old man can expect here?

431
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,315
There is no evil here.

432
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,224
No evil?

433
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,228
Even if you were to try
to strangle one of the girls...

434
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,278
it would be no worse
than Misting a baby's arm backwards.

435
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,379
You are disgusting!

436
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,324
And the strangled girl
wouldn't notice?... I don't think so.

437
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,268
Then it is perfect
for a violent suicide.

438
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,228
Should you feel too lonely
to commit suicide alone... go ahead.

439
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,305
And what if the loneliness was

440
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:03,251
so intense that even suicide
would not suffice to drive it out?

441
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:09,248
You've not drunk anything tonight,
have you? You're talking so strangely.

442
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,251
And what if an old man
who knew he was going to die

443
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,382
wanted to take one of these
young, virginal, dissolute children

444
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:24,417
with him on his journey to death?

445
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,192
The girl tonight is hot-blooded.

446
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,363
Just right for such a cold night.
You can warm yourself up.

447
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,281
It's pointless.

448
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,310
She can't hear you anyway.

449
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,278
What did you say'? Is that French?

450
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,178
I could simply make her pregnant.
She wouldn't even notice.

451
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,252
And then?

452
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,210
No, no. For the old there is death,

453
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,316
for the young there is love.

454
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,204
Death comes to us only once...

455
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,282
But what about love?

456
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,303
Who knows?

457
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,168
I was about ten years old...

458
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:58,279
I lay in hospital with pneumonia.
I was running a high fever,

459
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,386
and was assailed by shivering fits.

460
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:08,239
I heard the doctor tell my mother
that there was no hope for me,

461
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,370
that she should start
making funeral preparations.

462
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,411
My mother crawled onto my bed,
crying bitterly out loud.

463
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,244
Her cheeks were drenched...

464
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,239
She clasped me, the warmth
of her despair spreading to my body.

465
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,164
I clutched her too...

466
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,209
She wouldn't stop crying.

467
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,208
And then, suddenly,

468
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,340
after two weeks I was discharged...
healthy.

469
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,350
She'd saved my life.

470
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,159
But I, too,
once helped Mama to survive.

471
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,199
It was just after the Great War,
we were alone in our house.

472
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:09,377
Father was still in a prison camp,
and she got sick with typhoid.

473
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,226
No doctor could help her, they said.

474
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,258
The city was full of sick people
and medical supplies had run out.

475
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,230
An old woman from the neighbourhood

476
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:34,349
told her to out off some of her hair
every clay and eat it.

477
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:39,347
That was the only thing
that could help in such times.

478
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:45,354
Mama did as the old woman said,
and, out of desperation, ate her hair.

479
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:51,218
After just one week,
she looked utterly wretched.

480
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,357
I thought,
"Now the illness is consuming here."

481
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,192
Then she had no hair left at all.

482
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,215
She stroked my head and said,

483
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,279
"Now I'm going to cut off

484
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,351
a lock of your hair."

485
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,272
Back then I had thick, curly hair,

486
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,391
but after two weeks,
she'd even eaten all of that.

487
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,183
Then suddenly, as if by a miracle,

488
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,153
she became healthy again.

489
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:35,239
We would often stand together
in front of the mirror...

490
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,177
and laugh about our bald heads.

491
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,279
I noticed then that she had even
cut off all her pubic hair.

492
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,148
Good morning!
It's already after seven!

493
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,151
I'm awake!

494
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,237
I'm just about to get dressed.

495
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,228
The Devil himself
couldn't drag me away from here!

496
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:20,342
Enough! You have to get up now.
Wait! I'll help you.

497
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:31,324
Did you fall back to sleep?
...Was I sleeping, or dreaming?

498
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:36,176
Here, put this on. I'll make some tea.

499
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,368
Breakfast is already laid out.

500
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,305
Incidentally, the newspaper reports

501
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:57,239
about the old man
who died in that establishment

502
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:02,406
only mentioned a "sudden death".
In any case,

503
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:07,341
they managed to secretly move him into
a cheap hotel during the night.

504
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,230
People are saying

505
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,410
that there is probably
some organization behind it.

506
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:19,302
Anyway, you should be very careful.

507
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,332
Is there anything I have to fear?

508
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,336
They managed to deal with it
unnoticed that time,

509
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,266
but if such an incident
should happen again, then...

510
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,386
Well, I have the feeling...

511
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:42,198
that this establishment could not

512
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,335
continue to exist much longer.

513
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,152
Two days later

514
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,315
On the prowl

515
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:06,239
for daughters of pleasure,
a punter finds his prey with ease.

516
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:14,382
You've come on such a cold night?
...Yes, I find it terribly cold too.

517
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,393
To warm oneself on a young body
on such an icy night,

518
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:31,298
and perhaps to die a sudden death...
That must be paradise for an old man.

519
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,399
What vile things you talk of!
...An old man is a neighbor of death.

520
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,135
I hope you're not referring to me.

521
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:53,219
It's like the wind is blowing
through the cracks... There are none.

522
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,283
Oh, you mean the season? Yes.

523
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,305
And if the dead one's spirit
were here?

524
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,151
Spirit of a dead one?

525
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,252
Madame...

526
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,219
You know about it?
...Well, yes.

527
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,289
I understand. You know about it,
but you still came here.

528
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,238
May I please ask you to leave?

529
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:31,423
Since I knew it but came anyway,
then everything is alright, isn't it?

530
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,260
These things do happen, after all.

531
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,289
Winter is a dangerous time
for us old people.

532
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,254
I don't know what kind of old men
frequent this place,

533
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:50,159
I only know Kogi.
...No names, please. I didn't hear that.

534
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,266
But surely you know Mr Kogmann?

535
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,194
How long have you known Kogi...

536
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,275
who?

537
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,235
Kogmann.

538
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,231
No, I don't know him.

539
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:10,239
If a second or third death
occurred here,

540
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,239
you 'd face serious complications.

541
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:19,360
But I wouldn't be to blame.
...Partly to blame, without question.

542
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,164
The body of the dead man was taken...

543
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:29,239
What was his name again?
...Please, no names.

544
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:32,175
Under the cover of night, secretly,

545
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,203
to some place or other...

546
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,199
You helped do it.

547
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,339
I saw you.

548
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,204
We had to consider
the gentleman's reputation.

549
01:07:53,205 --> 01:07:55,214
His reputation?

550
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:00,239
You mean that even dead men
have a reputation to lose?

551
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:05,269
Yes, the newspapers would gleefully
write about a prominent old man

552
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,299
who died
at the side of a naked young woman.

553
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,206
A scandal!

554
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,124
Was it passion?

555
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,235
Or even...

556
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,206
murder?

557
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:22,239
An investigation into the death
may have entailed awkward enquiries.

558
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,299
And since this establishment

559
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:30,239
is rather unusual, the other guests
may have been inconvenienced.

560
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,198
Not to mention the girls...

561
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:39,239
But the girl must have been so fast
asleep that she couldn't have noticed.

562
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,311
Certainly not!

563
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,158
Had we left the gentleman here,

564
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:50,246
we would've had to remove the girl
and hide her. Moreover,

565
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:54,410
it would be easy to establish
that a woman had been lying with him.

566
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:59,239
Ah, she lay nestled close to him
as if to warm him?

567
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:03,336
This is pure fantasy!
I really must ask you to go now.

568
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:09,164
But I was merely joking.

569
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:20,250
How did you actually realise
that the old man was dead?

570
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:27,293
Well... I heard a strange moaning.
So I went upstairs to take a look.

571
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:33,159
The old man's pulse had stopped,
and his heart had stopped beating.

572
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,195
<i>Uh'?</i>

573
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,340
So you were there
when the old man dies?

574
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,242
And the girl...

575
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,124
didn't notice anything?

576
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:48,159
Even when the old man was taken away?

577
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:52,256
It's all arranged so that
the girls aren't woken by such things.

578
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:56,187
"By such things"...

579
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,152
And you've arranged it like that?

580
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,312
Do I know the girl who was with him?
...I can't tell you.

581
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,152
You shouldn't ask so many questions!

582
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,374
And now... go along to the girl.

583
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,275
Oh, I forgot to tell you...

584
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,287
There are two girls tonight.

585
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,338
Two?

586
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,216
The first time I had sex,
it was also with two women.

587
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,225
If you could call it that.

588
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:12,358
It was Walburga's Holy Communion.

589
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,164
Walburga was fourteen,

590
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,282
and I was twelve.

591
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:24,279
And Camilla, her younger sister,
was nine years old.

592
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,239
At 10 or 11 o'clock,
we children had to go to bed.

593
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:33,337
We had to sleep in their parents'
bed, which had room for three.

594
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,204
Walburga lay in the middle,

595
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,294
Camilla lay on her left,
and I lay on her right.

596
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,287
Suddenly I felt

597
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,287
a warm hand on my stomach.

598
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,270
She felt her way, deeper...

599
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:58,228
and then thrust her hand
into my pajama trousers.

600
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,232
We kissed each other breathlessly.

601
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,323
She took my hand,
and guided it to her pussy.

602
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,311
It felt incredible.

603
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,299
She helped my take off my trousers,

604
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,245
and pulled up her night-dress
all the way to her neck.

605
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:27,233
I felt her breasts,
which were already fully developed.

606
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,286
Our hands were everywhere.

607
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:38,234
Then she moaned so loud that Camilla
woke up. "What are you doing?"

608
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,316
she asked, and climbed over us.

609
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,350
And she snuggled up to me too.

610
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,323
Then, unexpectedly and unsuspectingly,

611
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,356
she brushed against me.

612
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,236
She cried out, full of indignation,

613
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:57,318
"Wally, he's not wearing any trousers!"

614
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:09,239
Exactly 15 years ago today,
I lost Monika and my daughter.

615
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:12,358
It's hard to believe it's so long ago.

616
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:17,199
What have I done in all these years?

617
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,379
Why did you leave me?

618
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,355
Why?

619
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,282
I don't believe you...

620
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,187
It wasn't an accident.

621
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,248
I simply can't believe that.

622
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,345
You wanted to get away from me.

623
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,237
But Why?

624
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,656
I don't understand.

625
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:59,211
Whatever I did wrong... You can't
simply vanish from someone's life,

626
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,445
just like that.

627
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,232
And why did you take Kiki,

628
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,214
our little child,

629
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,130
my child, your child,

630
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,628
along with you?

631
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:28,216
That was what
you always used to call her: Kiki.

632
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,204
Oh, Monika... why?

633
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,241
Papa!

634
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,117
Papa!

635
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,231
Kiki, my child.

636
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:34,205
Judging from her breasts,
she's 20 at most.

637
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,204
What's your voice like, I wonder.

638
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:56,276
When I really like an actress, I shut
my eyes and just listen to her voice.

639
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:03,259
And I imagine she's talking to me,
that I'm all alone with her.

640
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,294
She has lipstick on her lips.

641
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,306
I'm going to steal a kiss from you.

642
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:29,199
Surely a guest of this place
is permitted a kiss?

643
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,305
It's not forbidden, is it?

644
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:37,427
It's said the lips of a sleeping woman
are cold and moist.

645
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,367
But don't the lips
of a dead loved one

646
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,272
convey an even greater
shudder of emotions?

647
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:48,382
Have you ever kissed
a dead person's lips?

648
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,247
No.

649
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,264
Yes!

650
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,172
Mama.

651
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,210
I kissed her in the coffin.

652
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,358
Well, it wasn't a proper kiss.

653
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,134
Or maybe it was.

654
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,170
It was a farewell kiss.

655
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:13,199
I had no chance to give my wife
and daughter a farewell kiss.

656
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,315
The crash.

657
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,335
And what if
it really wasn't an accident?

658
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,333
I should accept this invitation.

659
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,180
Forgive me.

660
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,265
You must forgive me.

661
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,294
I'm just old, that's all.

662
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:19,290
The death of an old fart
is an ugly affair.

663
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,226
How did the madame put it?

664
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:29,269
It must be like
a passage into paradise for him.

665
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,185
It would nice if it were so.

666
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,221
I should try to get to sleep.

667
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,289
I'm going to take these tablets...

668
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,253
then I'll sleep as she does.

669
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:08,259
What distinguishes her from a corpse
is that blood circulates,

670
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,260
that she is breathing.

671
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,175
The difference is

672
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:25,213
that she will wake up tomorrow
with no feelings of love or shame.

673
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:39,416
But perhaps she will feel disgust,
and her conscience will torment her.

674
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,199
She doesn't even know the man
who stole her innocence.

675
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:48,273
She'll probably suspect
that it was one of the old men.

676
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:52,399
And she won't even tell the madame,
because she's afraid.

677
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:59,432
And since she'll remain silent
about an old man's breaking the rules,

678
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:04,199
the affair will remain
concealed forever.

679
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:23,293
If I should die during the night,
lying here between these two girls,

680
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,239
would it not be
the last true fulfillment?

681
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:44,361
Then they'd carry me, like all those
other old fools, to some sleazy hotel.

682
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,358
And they'd say that I'd committed
suicide with sleeping pills.

683
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,316
There'd be no farewell note.

684
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:59,199
And since no motive would be known,
it would be explained thus:

685
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:05,199
I was full of despair for
the miserable bit of life before me

686
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,180
and so forth.

687
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:15,432
Who will be the last woman
in my life? What makes me think that?

688
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:21,314
The last woman?
And which one would be the first?

689
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,219
The first woman?

690
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,345
It was my mother.

691
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,254
What makes me think that?

692
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,204
My first woman, yes.

693
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,232
As she suckled me,
I kissed her nipples.

694
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:40,255
Am I permitted to think such things?

695
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:43,272
Then some time later...
How old was I?

696
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,204
Eight? Yes, perhaps...

697
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,382
She was going out and wanted to say
good night, and I kissed her bosom.

698
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,229
And she said...

699
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:57,148
You're not allowed to do that anymore.

700
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,276
You're not my husband, after all.

701
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,195
Mama...

702
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,345
How long is it since you died?

703
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,157
Welcome home, son.

704
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:25,212
Why are you two just standing there?
Come here to me!

705
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,357
Is your wife always so shy?

706
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,316
Mama, what are these flowers for?

707
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,134
Well, just come inside now.

708
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,295
I almost didn't recognise
our house.

709
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,159
Oh, what lovely flowers!

710
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:01,186
But we never had flowers
like these before!

711
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:06,159
Oh, look, a red droplet
is falling from this flower.

712
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,195
What is it?

713
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,294
It is blood.

714
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,129
Oh, God!

715
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,195
Madame!

716
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,180
Come here!

717
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,599
What's the matter?

718
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:20,199
What are you doing?
- Her lips have gone cold. The girl is dead.

719
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,191
Dead? That's impossible.

720
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,931
Did you do anything to hen'?
- Heavens, no!

721
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,226
She is not dead,
don't let it trouble you.

722
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:33,212
What did you give hen'? Perhaps she
suffered an allergic reaction.

723
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:38,279
Don't worry, you won't be
inconvenienced. Your name is safe.

724
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:42,353
Nevertheless, she is dead.
...No, I don't believe she is.

725
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:48,199
Can I help?
- No, a man is waiting downstairs... But she's heavy.

726
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:53,319
Don't worry, just lie down again.
The other girl is still there.

727
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,220
Are you insane?

728
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:00,199
How am I meant to sleep?
No, I shall go home directly!

729
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,238
Please don't,
it wouldn't be good if you were seen

730
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,187
leaving here at such a time.

731
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,115
All I know

732
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:56,329
of death is that which we all know:
that it takes us

733
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:00,181
and plunges us into silence.

734
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:31,313
A copy of the 'Süddeutsche Zeitung'.
...1.50, please.

735
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,299
Hello. A 'Maxi', please.

736
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,662
And 20 in change.

737
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,504
Young defiance blossoms on your lips.

738
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,520
Crimson-red.

739
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:20,159
It's not the first time
he's broken a house rule.

740
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,356
But he must be punished.

741
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:35,354
One mustn't hold it against him.
My friend suffers from loneliness.

742
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,299
He has no pleasure in life anymore.

743
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,152
I would so much like to release him.

744
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,373
You do understand what I mean?

745
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,254
I understand.

746
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,219
I'll take care of everything.

747
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,259
I'll be in touch.

748
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:24,207
Did you want to say something?
...No... no.

749
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:36,393
Sometimes I think
that maybe he does look at me.

750
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,198
And then he becomes cold once more.

751
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,315
Yes.

752
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,248
You may come.

753
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,237
As usual.

754
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,248
But not before eleven.

755
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,315
DOUBT

756
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,197
What is 'staying'?

757
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:23,427
What is 'finally being' in all of this?

758
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:34,266
The following evening

759
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:12,190
Boss,

760
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,242
wake up.

761
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,261
Thank you, Mr Gold.

762
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:49,209
Weary of everything,
I shall be gone

763
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,123
dying and leaving

764
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,434
my love alone.

765
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:35,370
An angel escorts me to eternal rest.

766
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,174
It is done.

767
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:46,307
I knew that I could rely on you,
my dear.
