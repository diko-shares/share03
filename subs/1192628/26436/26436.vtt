1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:02,359
I ran another trace
on those text messages.

2
00:00:02,384 --> 00:00:03,359
You were right.

3
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,180
There's definitely
something off about them.

4
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,938
Previously on "Sweet/Vicious"...

5
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:10,860
- This is what we do!
- This is not what we do.

6
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,310
You want to fix me?

7
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,479
That's so sweet.

8
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,180
She's not well.

9
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,183
You know what happened
between Nate and Jules,

10
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,520
and you are the only
person who can help her now.

11
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,432
I'm so sorry Jules

12
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:26,434
for not believing what
he really did to you.

13
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,125
He can't just get away with this.

14
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:29,494
You deserve to be heard.

15
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,829
I worry that you don't
understand what will happen

16
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,232
if we move forward
opening a case like this.

17
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,501
Harris, what's going on?

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,413

Synced and corrected by Dragoniod for
www.addic7ed.com

20
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:52,216
Oh, man, graffiti art.

21
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:56,420
Personally, I don't get it, but...

22
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:57,688
what is art even?

23
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,958
I saw you and Jules last night.

24
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:02,375
So what?

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,995
Don't go fishing to see what I know.

26
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,865
I saw you fighting after
beating Brady to a bloody pulp.

27
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,765
He's in intensive care!

28
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:12,470
You were working with Barton.

29
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,172
I wanted to find out
who derailed my career

30
00:01:15,197 --> 00:01:17,095
and attacked me at Vinalyton.

31
00:01:18,017 --> 00:01:19,677
You bashed my knee.

32
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,143
I had to! You would have...

33
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,510
What, found you out?

34
00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:27,260
So what I heard, uh...

35
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:31,197
does that mean that Jules was... ?

36
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:38,471
She tried to go to the school, but...

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,353
Most of these girls

38
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:42,221
tried to go to the school,
but they don't help.

39
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:45,024
There's a reason that you
kept this from me, Ophelia.

40
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:46,258
It is because you know

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,894
that what you and Jules are doing

42
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:52,298
goes against everything that I believe.

43
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:58,404
What are you gonna do?

44
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:00,923
I don't know, but we're done here.

45
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:21,394
I'm here to report a sexual assault.

46
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,970
You okay?

47
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:32,878
I'm sensing some...

48
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:37,105
serious Lars von Trier sad vibe here.

49
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:41,009
I was actually going for more brooding,

50
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:43,378
like a Nicolas Wining Refn thing.

51
00:02:44,091 --> 00:02:46,349
- Oh, you nailed it.
- Mm.

52
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:50,357
Harris and I just got
in this huge fight,

53
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:51,673
and we are done-zo.

54
00:02:51,698 --> 00:02:53,065
I mean, friendship over.

55
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:54,423
No way. Come on.

56
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:58,329
Okay, Harris may be
mad, but he adores you.

57
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:01,253
Just give him some space.
I'm sure he'll come around.

58
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:09,872
Hey. Where have you been?

59
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:12,898
You haven't answered any of my texts.

60
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,867
I was with Jules.

61
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,895
I believe her, Nate.

62
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:23,172
Kennedy, she's, uh...

63
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,984
She's been lying to you all semester.

64
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:27,643
Would you just stop, please?

65
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:31,682
Please, please don't.

66
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:35,356
Don't do this to me. I love you.

67
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:40,411
What is this?

68
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,155
It's a summons to testify
before the Title IX board.

69
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:45,346
I wanted to give it to you myself.

70
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,182
Jules reported you to the school.

71
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:54,955
I don't think you, uh, realize

72
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,166
what this is gonna do to Jules.

73
00:03:58,854 --> 00:04:00,665
They're gonna rip her apart.

74
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,689
It's her word against mine now.

75
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:08,099
Thank you, Nate.

76
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:11,897
I thought this was
gonna be so hard, but...

77
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,766
not anymore.

78
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:16,835
We're done.

79
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:31,216
Oh, it's you.

80
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:39,202
Listen, the things that
I said the other night

81
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:40,893
were unforgivable,

82
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:44,830
and I didn't mean any of
it, and I am so, so sorry.

83
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,332
It's okay.

84
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:49,840
Yeah, you know, you, um...

85
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,936
You were really, really mean to me.

86
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:56,147
You said some things that
were incredibly hurtful,

87
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,943
but...

88
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,379
I'm forgiving you.

89
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,169
Because... ?

90
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:04,249
Because Harris saw us in Brady's room.

91
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:05,851
He knows about us.

92
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:09,426
Well, is he... Is he
going to the authorities?

93
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:10,379
What can we do?

94
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:12,690
Harris doesn't have it
in him to send us to jail.

95
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:16,964
He just will never, ever talk
to me again and hate me forever.

96
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:18,797
Well, if there's
anything I can do, just...

97
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,033
please tell me.

98
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:24,570
And, um, I have news.

99
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:27,356
Because of you, Kennedy came to find me,

100
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,774
and I...

101
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:31,109
reported Nate to the school.

102
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:34,713
Wait. What?

103
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:37,675
All of a sudden, you trust
the school to do something?

104
00:05:37,677 --> 00:05:40,845
I mean, no, not really, but I just...

105
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:43,781
I think I owe it to myself
to give due process a chance.

106
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:46,327
And I know that there's no guarantees,

107
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:49,353
but if they find Nate guilty...

108
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:52,223
maybe I can start to move on.

109
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:01,734
Thank you for sitting
down with us, Miss Dalton.

110
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,490
You're here because
Darlington administration

111
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:04,990
is fully committed to finding out

112
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:07,177
exactly what happened
between the reporting party,

113
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:09,016
Jules Thomas,

114
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:10,610
and the respondent, Nate Griffin.

115
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,321
I'll remind you that these
proceedings are confidential,

116
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:16,924
and you're not to say
anything to anyone.

117
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,417
So let's talk about
the night of April 23rd.

118
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:23,097
Hos and CEOs... so gross.

119
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:26,641
My ex-boyfriend Nate is
president of the fraternity,

120
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,186
but I was sick, so I couldn't come.

121
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,338
Was there alcohol or drugs there?

122
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,241
. That was good.

123
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,076
Is there immunity for
self-incrimination?

124
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:38,879
Maybe I took Molly. No. Wait. Yes.

125
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:40,650
No. I don't know. Pass?

126
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:41,947
I was eating a lot of M&Ms,

127
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:44,451
but those were just regular M&Ms.

128
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:45,306
It wasn't like...

129
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:47,121
They weren't, like, party M&Ms.

130
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:50,220
Would you characterize
Jules as promiscuous?

131
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,490
I don't characterize
anyone as promiscuous.

132
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:53,967
What was her state of inebriation

133
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,608
when she went upstairs?

134
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:59,666
Super wasted.

135
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:02,073
She could barely walk around.

136
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,818
Jules uploaded a
picture of herself, you,

137
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,068
Miss Cho, and Miss Dalton

138
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:10,091
all holding bottles of alcohol,
with a caption that reads,

139
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:12,267
"These CEOs are ready to get freaky."

140
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,736
Would you say that Jules

141
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:17,423
entered the party
interested in finding sex?

142
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,543
No, that's just how we
talk. You can't judge that.

143
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:26,137
And you left the party with
Miss Cho and Miss Price,

144
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:29,440
and Jules stayed there?

145
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:31,901
I mean, we looked for Jules,

146
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:33,932
but when we couldn't find her,

147
00:07:33,957 --> 00:07:36,648
we just figured she was
with one of the brothers,

148
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:39,239
so, uh, we left.

149
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,282
They're our friends.
We didn't know that...

150
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:47,277
Thank you so much for, uh,
coming in and speaking with us.

151
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:50,083
Uh, your honesty is
very much appreciated.

152
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:02,337
- Thank you so much for coming.
- I'm so sorry about the party.

153
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:11,819
This isn't gonna be easy.
I-I have a lot to tell you.

154
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:14,194
Oh, my God, me too.

155
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,496
All I've wanted to do for the last month

156
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:18,013
is talk to you.

157
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:20,543
I-I finally filed

158
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:23,168
the missing person's
report on my brother.

159
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:25,427
- What?
- Yeah.

160
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,200
The police are gonna
search Carter's apartment,

161
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:28,981
the garage where he worked.

162
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,720
Finally.

163
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:32,455
- That's, um... That's good.
- _

164
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:34,790
That's... that's really good.

165
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:41,747
Sorry. Um, hello.

166
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:42,990
Ophelia, oh, my gosh.

167
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:44,690
Um...

168
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:46,839
Of course. I'll be right there.

169
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:49,238
I'm... I'm sorry.

170
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,679
Wait. You're leaving?

171
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:53,695
Yeah. It's, um, her kidney's...

172
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:55,311
stones.

173
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:57,307
She thinks she has kidney stones.

174
00:08:57,332 --> 00:09:00,049
Jesus Christ. Okay.

175
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:01,951
It was really nice to see you.

176
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:04,687
Hey, Thomas.

177
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:08,024
I miss that smile a lot.

178
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:14,458
♪ I've been looking so long
at these pictures of you ♪

179
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,187
Ah!

180
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:18,501
We have a problem.

181
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:21,300
Wait, are you hitting that lying down?

182
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:22,401
Yeah.

183
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,495
It took me a couple times to, um...

184
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:26,621
get the positioning just right.

185
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:31,339
T-Tyler has filed a missing
person's report on Carter,

186
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,982
and the police... they're
going back to the garage

187
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:34,083
to look for evidence.

188
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:35,640
Tyler, you gorgeous idiot,

189
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:36,936
whose side are you on?

190
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:38,585
His dead brother's side.

191
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,456
I mean, we wiped that place clean,

192
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,191
but, I mean, we were
frantic, and we were rushing.

193
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:44,895
We could have missed something,
and your vomit was everywhere,

194
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,630
and...

195
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:47,473
Um, I can't believe this.

196
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:50,166
I have to go and testify.

197
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:51,901
Maybe I could just push the meeting.

198
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:54,804
No, no, no. Um, I got this.

199
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:58,374
You just need to... you need
to focus on your trial, okay?

200
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:00,865
And I-I will find out
what the cops know.

201
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:03,179
Okay.

202
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:10,970
♪ And we kissed as the sky fell in... ♪

203
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,355
We appreciate your cooperation.

204
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:13,856
We know this isn't easy.

205
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,758
Some of our questions may
be difficult to answer,

206
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,528
but the more you can share,
the quicker we can resolve this.

207
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,466
So Hos and CEOs, and
which were you dressed as?

208
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:24,785
A CEO.

209
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:29,038
Oh, I haven't met many
CEOs dressed like that.

210
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,007
Did you go to the party with
the intention of seeing Nate?

211
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,576
I went to the party with the intention

212
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:35,010
of having fun with my friends,

213
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:36,746
and Nate was one of my friends.

214
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:39,782
Jules showed up without Kennedy,

215
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:43,853
so I think she saw an opening...

216
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:46,989
She had a little crush on me.

217
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:49,191
So, after drinking and beer pong,

218
00:10:49,193 --> 00:10:50,862
you asked to lie down in his bed,

219
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:53,596
and you went to his room alone?

220
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:54,806
I couldn't find my friends,

221
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:58,067
and I was too wasted to
walk home, and I just...

222
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,435
I needed to lie down.

223
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:00,936
Would you say that you were in any state

224
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:02,949
to be making sound decisions?

225
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,829
I could barely stand.

226
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,376
Ah, I mean...

227
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:11,080
she was a little drunk...

228
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:12,846
sure, but...

229
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:15,684
we all were.

230
00:11:15,686 --> 00:11:17,853
What happened when
you got to Nate's room?

231
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:24,760
The room was spinning, and I passed out.

232
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:30,243
Jules was laying in my
bed sort of waiting for me.

233
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:33,063
I woke up, and Nate was kissing my neck.

234
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,838
I pushed him off, and
he got on top of me,

235
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,236
and he put his hand over my mouth.

236
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:42,144
He pulled up my skirt, and
he took my underwear off.

237
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:46,956
She lifted her... her hips
for me to take her panties off.

238
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:48,851
I said, "Nate, no."

239
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:53,456
She started moaning, you
know. She said my name.

240
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,057
I tried to get out from underneath him,

241
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,805
but he was so much
stronger than me, and...

242
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:01,164
I rocked around, but
I couldn't free myself.

243
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:03,523
Did you say "no"?

244
00:12:03,781 --> 00:12:05,398
I just told you that I said no.

245
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:07,436
I could tell that once
we started having sex,

246
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:09,538
she was a little worried
that Kennedy would find out,

247
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,476
so I told her it would
be, uh, our secret,

248
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:16,745
which, you know, looking back on it,

249
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:19,748
I realize that it's probably a...

250
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,339
Probably a little scary, right?

251
00:12:22,364 --> 00:12:24,046
But you didn't try to stop him.

252
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,053
Yes, I did.

253
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:29,026
I would never, ever do
anything to hurt Jules.

254
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:32,962
I feel sick that she thinks

255
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:36,632
that whatever happened
between us was anything

256
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:38,315
but sex between...

257
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:41,323
Sex between two friends.

258
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:44,570
I couldn't process what
was happening to me...

259
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,408
and that Nate was the one doing it.

260
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,612
I don't want... I don't want
to call her a liar, but...

261
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:54,169
She's wrong.

262
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:57,820
Thank you for your testimony.

263
00:12:57,822 --> 00:12:59,609
Miss Tate and I are going
to review the information

264
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:01,851
and make a decision shortly.

265
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:03,070
Thank you.

266
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:05,828
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

267
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,428
Officer, officer, you got to help!

268
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:10,666
This total psycho on a bike just rode by

269
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:11,901
and just grabbed my phone.

270
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:13,536
Okay, do you have a "find my phone" app?

271
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:15,671
What? No, no, you have to get him.

272
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:19,542
Uh, uh, there are
pictures on my phone...

273
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:22,678
Private pictures, very
graphic, very graphic.

274
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,914
I was experimenting with my sexuality

275
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,882
and, you know, just kind
of feeling my groove out,

276
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:28,517
and I decided to get a little creative

277
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,885
so there's a lot of me bending,

278
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:31,921
and fruit was involved, like kiwi and...

279
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:34,990
Okay, okay, just stop.
God, stop, please.

280
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:37,393
Oh, no, no, no, he...
he was on the sidewalk,

281
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:39,094
so you can't get him by your car.

282
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:39,896
Okay.

283
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:45,434
- Go. Come on, hurry!
- Okay, all right, all right.

284
00:14:03,486 --> 00:14:05,749
Oh, I...

285
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:06,889
Here you go.

286
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:09,351
He must've dropped it when
he ran around the corner.

287
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:11,927
Thank you so much. A true hero.

288
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,530
Oh. Have a good one.

289
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:24,223
So what else did they ask you?

290
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:27,276
Mostly they just asked me a
lot of questions about drinking.

291
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:27,986
I don't know why.

292
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:30,579
It's not like we have
a problem with alcohol.

293
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:39,688
So, uh, you told them that
Jules was all over me, right?

294
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,131
'Cause she was.

295
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:43,292
Yeah, I said she was flirting with you,

296
00:14:43,397 --> 00:14:46,562
but I don't know what happened
once you went upstairs.

297
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,946
Oh! What up, Coach?

298
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:53,422
Hey, man.

299
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:56,173
Hey, um, do you have
any positions on the team

300
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,274
for, like, a skinny Jewish kid?

301
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:02,144
Hey, uh, clear eyes, full hearts...

302
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:05,014
- Shut up, Miles.
- Okay, great.

303
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,650
Hey. Uh, so...

304
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:09,218
did you hear anything or... ?

305
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,086
No, but I wouldn't worry about it.

306
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:14,089
I just want you to focus
on the game, all right?

307
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:15,858
I'm taking care of everything.

308
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:27,218
_

309
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,267
Oh, my God, that little asshole.

310
00:15:35,312 --> 00:15:38,013
"Right before the game.
Heard it was Jules Thomas.

311
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:40,254
She wishes."

312
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:41,550
What's going on?

313
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:55,049
Did you see this?

314
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,099
See, this is exactly why girls

315
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:58,867
don't report their sexual assaults.

316
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:01,270
Stop trying to justify
your criminal activity.

317
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:06,075
Yes, yes, this is he.

318
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,176
Ellen Thurston?

319
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:13,816
Ellen Thurston.

320
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:15,698
- Okay, yeah.
- _

321
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:17,010
No, of course.

322
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:21,023
I'll be there. Thank you.

323
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:30,684
People are always gonna
think of me as this girl.

324
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:32,634
No, no, they'll say,

325
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:36,572
"Look, there's a badass queen
with amazing bone structure."

326
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:38,787
Come in.

327
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,411
Hey. Tyler's here.
What should I tell him?

328
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:44,646
I mean, he is part of the
white male establishment,

329
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,564
but he's also really cute.

330
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:49,985
You can send him in.

331
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:59,695
Hey.

332
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:10,291
Is it true?

333
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:18,666
I am so sorry. I...

334
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:24,219
Jules, I-I had no idea.

335
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:26,755
No, it's not your fault. I-I hid it.

336
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:29,218
I wasn't ready for you to know.

337
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:30,820
I...

338
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:33,996
Ugh, when I saw you and
Nate during the lockdown,

339
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:36,165
God, I asked if you
had feelings for him.

340
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:39,301
- You know that I would never...
- I know, I know. It's okay.

341
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:44,473
I had so many things
I wanted to say to you,

342
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:46,942
but looking into your eyes,

343
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:49,645
right now all I want to do is...

344
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:52,181
tell you how sorry I am.

345
00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:54,411
I'm sorry that I didn't see it.

346
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,724
I'm sorry that this happened.

347
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:10,528
I actually have to go and meet Ophelia.

348
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:14,102
Okay. Um...

349
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:17,090
But tell me, what can I do now?

350
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:19,528
I want to be there for you.

351
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:23,946
I'm finding out the results
of my trial tomorrow.

352
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:25,532
Can you come?

353
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:29,499
Uh, wow. That will officially
be the worst date ever.

354
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:35,224
I'm in.

355
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:42,898
So I, uh... I traced
the source of the leak.

356
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,401
Why? We all know who did it.

357
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:48,170
You know, I can't
believe that Nate Griffin

358
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:50,439
is going to be a hero and I
might go to jail for murder.

359
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:51,421
Not happening.

360
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:53,742
- We're handling this.
- Are we?

361
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:55,244
Because, I mean, how much longer

362
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:56,645
are we just gonna have to
keep covering our tracks?

363
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:58,847
Oh, speaking of which, why don't you go

364
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:01,151
and clean the car that you vomited on?

365
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:08,123
Rats!

366
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:18,150
I can't believe I'm missing sleep

367
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:20,452
to babysit a crime scene.

368
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:22,955
Captain said CSI would be here by now.

369
00:19:22,957 --> 00:19:25,224
No, not until tomorrow.

370
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:30,329
- What are you doing?
- Damn it.

371
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:33,632
I'm missing this asshole Squirtle.

372
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:38,614
_

373
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:42,507
_

374
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:46,578
What are you doing?

375
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,448
Snapchat. I was gonna
add this to my story.

376
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,917
What do you think? I'm
getting us out of here.

377
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:56,755
16, this is Dispatch.

378
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:58,645
We got a 314 at 905 Dallas Avenue.

379
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,360
Don't you see it's a
drunk and disorderly?

380
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:04,412
A bunch of paperwork and
puke. Let somebody else get it.

381
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:05,864
Hey, I'm not gonna miss a
chance to get out of here

382
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:08,100
just because you're
obsessed with "Pokémon GO."

383
00:20:08,102 --> 00:20:09,434
That game's not even relevant anymore.

384
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:11,270
Got it.

385
00:20:11,272 --> 00:20:13,405
Officers Ballard and Veach responding.

386
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:24,713
Seriously?

387
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:29,254
Oh, my God, I'm so cute.

388
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,557
Don't save that.

389
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:36,295
I just can't wait for this to be over.

390
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:38,096
I just can't stop thinking about it.

391
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:39,998
Why would she do something like this?

392
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,967
She could ruin Nate's life.

393
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:46,538
I'd love to get raped
by Nate or any CSOs.

394
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,840
Let's just get out of here.

395
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:54,846
Oh, nice. Good to see you, Miles.

396
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:56,915
You guys sure are talking a lot of shit.

397
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:59,418
You're worried it's
gonna ruin Nate's life?

398
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,019
What about Jules's life?

399
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:03,388
What if this happened to
your best friend or to you,

400
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,426
or, no, wait, I forgot,
you'd love to get raped.

401
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:08,827
Why don't you educate yourself

402
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:13,265
before you say something
so incredibly heinous?

403
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:16,335
Come on, Ken.

404
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:17,803
And... and, Miles,

405
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:21,039
you might want to take a
closer look at your best friend.

406
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,108
He's not who you think he is.

407
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:32,017
Hey.

408
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:33,418
It's sweet of you to come.

409
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,619
What, are you kidding me?

410
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:37,189
My top three favorite things in life...

411
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:38,523
The smell of fresh paint,

412
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:41,693
black-and-white cookies,
and Title IX hearings.

413
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:50,531
Hey, we believe in you, Griffin.

414
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:52,504
Thank you.

415
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:53,757
Hey, have some respect.

416
00:21:53,782 --> 00:21:55,841
Hey, this is not the
time or the place, son.

417
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:57,609
Say that to your little quarter-bitch.

418
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:00,994
He's the one acknowledging hate speech.

419
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,015
What did you just say to me?

420
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:05,942
Hey, come on.

421
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:09,287
Come on. He's not worth it.

422
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:14,493
I didn't do anything
wrong, and she knows it.

423
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:16,461
Hey, hey, that's enough.

424
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:18,397
That's enough, that's enough.

425
00:22:22,903 --> 00:22:24,536
I...

426
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:27,773
asked you to be there for me, but...

427
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:28,840
not like that.

428
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:54,566
We're ready for you, Jules.

429
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:09,781
Did Tyler just punch Nate in the face?

430
00:23:09,783 --> 00:23:11,683
Yeah.

431
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:14,119
That's awesome.

432
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:15,554
Thank you for your testimony.

433
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:17,489
After a very thorough investigation

434
00:23:17,491 --> 00:23:19,357
and examining all the facts,

435
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,592
we have determined that you are guilty

436
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:24,262
of sexually assaulting Jules Thomas.

437
00:23:24,264 --> 00:23:26,431
What?

438
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:29,201
Wait. So, um, that's it?

439
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:31,736
He's guilty? I...

440
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:34,272
I don't have to see him anymore?

441
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:35,907
That's right.

442
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:38,477
We thank you for your bravery
during these proceedings.

443
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:43,615
Thank you.

444
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:56,150
Let me be clear... I
am very happy for you,

445
00:23:56,152 --> 00:23:59,821
but I am a little surprised.

446
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:01,889
I...

447
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:04,325
I thought the whole reason
we were doing this thing

448
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:08,996
is because if the girls
reported their assaults...

449
00:24:08,998 --> 00:24:13,201
they wouldn't get any justice
from Darlington, but...

450
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,369
Yeah.

451
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,471
And, you know, we...

452
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:20,588
We beat up a lot of people
based on this theory.

453
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,010
We sure did.

454
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:27,715
In fact, and... and correct
me if I am wrong, but, um...

455
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:31,519
you didn't report this originally

456
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:35,389
because you thought they
wouldn't believe you, and yet...

457
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,659
I got a guilty verdict.

458
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:44,866
Huh.

459
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:48,936
Are there, uh, any updates
on the police database?

460
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:52,240
No, none so far.

461
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,643
Have you heard from Harris?

462
00:24:55,645 --> 00:24:58,946
Hey, don't give up. He'll come around.

463
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:12,260
So great to meet you, Harris.

464
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,897
Your "Medium" article
was extremely impressive.

465
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:18,232
Your thesis was strong, and
the evidence backing it up

466
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:20,701
was very thorough.

467
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:22,570
I've actually lost
interest in that case.

468
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:24,338
You know what I've not lost interest in,

469
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,707
an internship with the DA's office.

470
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,643
You know, Harris, a lot of times

471
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:31,779
overeager students will
withhold relevant information

472
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,814
from the police because
they want to be the ones

473
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:35,182
to crack the case.

474
00:25:35,184 --> 00:25:36,038
I just want to make sure

475
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,155
that you are not making
that same mistake.

476
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,389
No. I have nothing new to share.

477
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:43,658
If there is something new,

478
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,626
and you don't share it with us,

479
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,929
that would make you an accessory...

480
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:49,897
A felony.

481
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:55,469
Thank you for sitting
down with me, Jules.

482
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,038
As you know, Title IX proceedings

483
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,873
are not legal proceedings,

484
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:02,076
which means that, uh,
while the decisions

485
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:04,545
we make are official,

486
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:07,782
we're not always the last word.

487
00:26:07,784 --> 00:26:12,578
I just found out that
your case was overturned.

488
00:26:12,603 --> 00:26:14,555
I'm so sorry.

489
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:17,625
Mr. Griffin's family
decided to appeal my verdict.

490
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:20,962
What? Who can do that?

491
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,773
People higher up than me.

492
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:26,968
Sorry, so you're saying that, um...

493
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,639
That President Mays,
who has never met me,

494
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:35,109
knows nothing about me
or what I've been through,

495
00:26:35,111 --> 00:26:38,720
has decided that Nate
Griffin is innocent.

496
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,215
I imagine this is difficult for you.

497
00:26:41,217 --> 00:26:43,918
If you'd like to take
some time away from school,

498
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,786
we can arrange that.

499
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:48,622
You could return as
soon as you're ready.

500
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,500
Hi, Mackenzie.

501
00:26:59,502 --> 00:27:01,402
Oh. Good, you saw me.

502
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:03,971
I didn't want to sneak up.

503
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:11,272
Are you okay?

504
00:27:12,358 --> 00:27:14,982
I was thinking of organizing a protest.

505
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:17,518
That's very sweet, but, um...

506
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,220
that's not gonna do much.

507
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:22,490
You're just gonna let
them overturn this?

508
00:27:22,492 --> 00:27:24,258
You're not angry?

509
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,259
You know what?

510
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:27,131
I got to tell my truth,

511
00:27:27,156 --> 00:27:30,464
and that alone is more liberating

512
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:33,801
than you could ever know.

513
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:37,071
What's happening now... It's...

514
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:41,609
way bigger than just my case.

515
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:43,892
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

516
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:48,616
I'm the sorority safety chair.

517
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:51,185
If anyone had the responsibility

518
00:27:51,187 --> 00:27:55,040
to make sure that we didn't
leave you behind, it was me.

519
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:58,592
I'm gonna institute a new rule.

520
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,528
No Zeta sister leaves a party

521
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,130
unless every Zeta is accounted for.

522
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:06,067
Thank you.

523
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:14,396
If there's a drop of blood in here,

524
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:17,111
the luminol will show us where it's at.

525
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:26,787
Oh, shit.

526
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:52,313
Hi, it's me. I just called to say hi.

527
00:28:55,852 --> 00:28:58,319
You're so good, Harris.

528
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:03,424
You're so good. You're
my... You're my best friend.

529
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:07,461
And I know I screwed things up,

530
00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:10,264
but I'm... I'm gonna make it right.

531
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:12,166
You're so good.

532
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:18,172
I'm going to the DA's office
right now to turn myself in.

533
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:23,380
And, uh...

534
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:25,346
And you can be free,

535
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:30,317
and you don't have to live
with my secrets anymore.

536
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,852
Okay.

537
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,030
Oh, no.

538
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,498
No, are you leaving?

539
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,268
I had a whole thing planned with Jenga

540
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,203
and sex and sexual Jenga.

541
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:51,038
Don't ask questions, all right?

542
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,339
Just let it happen.

543
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:56,076
Hey, can we actually, um, do this later?

544
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:59,313
I've got somewhere I
need to be right now.

545
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:03,217
Oh, yeah, yeah. No,
later... later's fine.

546
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:07,054
I will see you later, right?

547
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,056
Of course.

548
00:30:43,652 --> 00:30:45,285
What are you guys doing here?

549
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:47,287
Bitch, what are you doing here?

550
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:50,691
- Get up.
- Get up.

551
00:30:50,693 --> 00:30:52,199
Jesus, you are...

552
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:56,412
Uh, Miss Thurston, just
the woman I was looking for.

553
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,638
Harris, what are you doing here?

554
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,689
I just wanted to say,

555
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:01,375
if I wasn't clear when
we sat down before,

556
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:03,274
that I would love to be considered

557
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,555
for an internship here.

558
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,013
Please keep me in mind
if there are any openings.

559
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,583
Okay. Thank you.

560
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:16,090
Have you lost your mind?

561
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:18,226
You were gonna turn yourself in.

562
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:22,196
I mean, I knew you were crazy,
but that was... no, not cool.

563
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:24,465
You're too close to us, Harris.

564
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:27,401
I just didn't want you
to go down for my crimes.

565
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:30,571
What... What did you hack my phone?

566
00:31:30,573 --> 00:31:32,707
Put a recording device on my pen, huh?

567
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:34,609
What was it?

568
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:36,744
- Microphone in your bag.
- Oh.

569
00:31:36,746 --> 00:31:38,479
Oh, please. How do you
think this all started?

570
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,448
You put tracking software on my phone.

571
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,216
Ophelia, if we'd have been any later,

572
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:44,788
you'd have gone to jail
for a very, very long time.

573
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:46,020
And did you ever think about the fact

574
00:31:46,022 --> 00:31:47,788
that there's two of us in these hits?

575
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,857
They would have found me.

576
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:51,826
That is... that is a good point.

577
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:55,196
Look, I'm just really tired of
messing everyone else's life up.

578
00:31:55,198 --> 00:31:57,330
I'm tired of being the screwup.

579
00:31:58,518 --> 00:32:02,003
Look, you... you've bailed
me out a million times.

580
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,205
You're so kind and smart,

581
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:07,508
and just the thought

582
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,077
that I might have ruined
all that for you is...

583
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:17,018
Yes, I want you to take
responsibility for your actions,

584
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,701
but that doesn't mean I want you
to throw your whole life away.

585
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,058
You're a pain in my ass.

586
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,327
You're my
ride-or-die.

587
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,972
You guys, you saved me.

588
00:32:37,974 --> 00:32:39,840
We're all best friends.

589
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,477
Yes, I saved you,

590
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:46,914
but that doesn't mean I condone this.

591
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,783
You got to stop this.

592
00:32:48,785 --> 00:32:51,352
You two are in danger.

593
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:55,723
I got to go. I'll see you tomorrow?

594
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:07,735
So Nate's expulsion got overturned.

595
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:10,938
Yeah, I heard.

596
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,407
You can appeal.

597
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,910
No, I'm not gonna appeal.

598
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:19,714
We're gonna handle it.

599
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:21,515
[bleep], yes.

600
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:27,054
Thanks, dude. I really needed it.

601
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:29,890
Oh, these are both for me.

602
00:33:29,892 --> 00:33:31,592
But, yeah, sure.

603
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:38,785
So, uh...

604
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,071
What's up? You good?

605
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:46,751
Yeah. No, man, I'm not.

606
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:50,177
Well, did you hear the good news?

607
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:52,880
Yeah. No, I heard it. I..

608
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:55,683
I know you're saying what
Jules said isn't true,

609
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:59,086
but I heard some things, and
it really sounds like it is.

610
00:34:02,525 --> 00:34:04,325
I already told you, man.

611
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:06,093
She was wasted.

612
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:08,028
She knew exactly what was going on,

613
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,363
and then she regretted it,

614
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:12,700
so she made up some ridiculous story.

615
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:15,770
Dude, come on...

616
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:17,271
just level with me, all right?

617
00:34:17,273 --> 00:34:18,773
I'm not the school. I'm not Zeta.

618
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:21,575
I just want to understand what happened.

619
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:24,645
Are you kidding me, man?

620
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:26,580
You were the one who
told me to come up here!

621
00:34:26,582 --> 00:34:29,650
I thought she wanted
to sleep with you, okay?

622
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:30,822
I...

623
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,097
I didn't tell you to
come up here and rape her.

624
00:34:33,152 --> 00:34:35,168
Hey, watch your mouth.

625
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:39,232
I thought Jules was into you, okay?

626
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,006
But if I was wrong and she said no...

627
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:44,999
She didn't say no! She
didn't say anything!

628
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:47,268
Yeah, because she was asleep!

629
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,370
Do you really not see how wrong this is?

630
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:51,405
Why would you leak it to the school?

631
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:53,513
None of this makes any sense, Nate.

632
00:34:54,043 --> 00:34:56,944
Get out of my room.

633
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:59,666
Real mature, man.

634
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,150
- Shut the door on your way out.
- Yeah, no problem.

635
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:14,395
- Hey.
- Hey.

636
00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:17,031
I take it your thing went well?

637
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:20,067
It did.

638
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:22,169
Are you okay? What's up?

639
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:27,843
- Can I tell you something?
- Anything.

640
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:32,366
I am a dark person...

641
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:34,281
and I-I can handle it.

642
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:37,551
I mean, I let myself
get sad when I need to.

643
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:42,256
But lately, the darkness
just feels really intense,

644
00:35:42,258 --> 00:35:44,191
like, um...

645
00:35:44,193 --> 00:35:47,661
these little messed-up voices

646
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:51,265
that pollute my brain
are just getting louder,

647
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:54,702
and I just feel completely selfish

648
00:35:54,704 --> 00:35:57,838
for having any of these
anxious or depressed thoughts,

649
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,474
knowing what Jules went through.

650
00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:03,110
It's funny... it's like
I was predisposed to it,

651
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:05,194
but she was...

652
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:08,215
forced into it.

653
00:36:09,923 --> 00:36:14,165
Together we make this
twisted, dark hole,

654
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:17,591
and I want to continue
having this conversation,

655
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:19,560
I really do, because
I think it's important,

656
00:36:19,562 --> 00:36:22,296
but... but it's equally
important to note

657
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:24,899
that I heard "dark hole"
as soon as I said it.

658
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,208
- Thank you for sharing that.
- My feelings or my dark hole?

659
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,977
- Both.
- Well, yeah.

660
00:36:40,149 --> 00:36:42,917
Come in.

661
00:36:52,028 --> 00:36:55,396
I am so sorry about losing my
cool at your Title Ix meeting.

662
00:36:55,398 --> 00:36:57,064
It's okay.

663
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:59,767
There's no right way to
process something like this.

664
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:02,369
Well, there's definitely wrong ways.

665
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:07,474
All of the anger

666
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:11,437
and confusion I've been
feeling about my brother and...

667
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:13,280
what Nate did to you,

668
00:37:13,282 --> 00:37:16,116
it just came out

669
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:18,252
in that moment.

670
00:37:18,254 --> 00:37:22,523
I know that you don't need
someone to fight your battles.

671
00:37:22,525 --> 00:37:26,093
Jules, you are one of
the strongest people

672
00:37:26,095 --> 00:37:27,294
I've ever met.

673
00:37:48,884 --> 00:37:53,153
All I want to do is make you feel safe.

674
00:38:58,752 --> 00:39:01,369
_

675
00:39:03,729 --> 00:39:08,032
_

676
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,786
_

677
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:13,775
_

678
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,784
_

679
00:39:32,693 --> 00:39:34,576
Hey. We got a match on the blood.

680
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:37,164
Does it match the video footage?

681
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:54,421
Do you order whipped cream?

682
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,569
Do I?

683
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,102
- No.
- Okay.

684
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,271
What about caramel drizzle?

685
00:40:04,744 --> 00:40:08,245
Well, that was worth the wait.

686
00:40:08,247 --> 00:40:11,782
Jules, Jules, you have
to come downstairs.

687
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:26,363
Tyler Finn,

688
00:40:26,365 --> 00:40:28,933
you're under arrest for
the murder of Carter Fisher.

689
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,898
What?

690
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:33,103
Carter's dead?

691
00:40:33,105 --> 00:40:34,905
My stepbrother is dead?
Veach, what's going on?

692
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:36,540
Please, what do you
know about my brother?

693
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:37,842
- Tyler, no!
- Dude.

694
00:40:37,844 --> 00:40:40,244
No, you can't do this!

695
00:40:40,246 --> 00:40:42,947
Stop! Don't! You can't do this!

696
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:44,548
Don't say anything, okay?

697
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,618
I'll call my dad, and I'll
meet you at the station.

698
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,087
Oh, my God!
