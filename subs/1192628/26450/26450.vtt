shorted out a little.

Your... your father is a police cop?

186

Yeah, well, technically he's a sheriff,

187
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,718
but he made friends with
Ballard when I moved to college

188
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,515
and told him to watch out for me.

189

201
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:30,473

That sounds like a plan, ladies.

203
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:34,076
So it's the 2,000 quoted

204

plus an additional 200 for processing.

205
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:40,298
- We only have the 2,000.
- Unfortunately,

What's wrong, Dalton?

364
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,261
Don't like it when
we talk about titties?

365

Come on, man, we're just

Yeah. You look great.

Oh, I guess so.

And you're the famous...?

377
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,575
Kennedy. Best friend of Jules.

Hey, so how's your green-haired friend?

381
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,716
She seemed pretty bombed last night.

382
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,119
- Oh, that weed girl?
- Oh, yeah.

Okay, great.

I'm so glad that you guys met,

It's hard to believe, but it's

coming back from that.
