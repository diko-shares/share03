1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:02,204
Previously on "Incorporated"...

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:03,890
I haven't been on the
other side of the wall...

3
00:00:03,915 --> 00:00:05,062
In eight years.

4
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:06,570
I've been having the episodes again.

5
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:07,695
You have to make a decision.

6
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,678
Are you gonna let one twist
of fate decide who you are?

7
00:00:10,703 --> 00:00:12,369
My neighbor Rosa... her daughter...

8
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:13,904
there's something wrong with her belly.

9
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:15,773
I've been hearing her
scream through the night.

10
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:17,441
Is the pain on her right side?

11
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:19,229
It could be appendicitis.

12
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:21,434
Your friend's daughter... bring
her tonight. I'll examine her.

13
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:23,313
These people aren't authorized
to be in the perimeter.

14
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,887
They're on the log.

15
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:28,318
You haven't told him
about the riot you started?

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,753
What if she's pregnant?

17
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:32,756
Your plan is to take birth control

18
00:00:32,758 --> 00:00:34,224
behind your wife's back?

19
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:35,492
I don't want to hurt her.

20
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,961
You know I miss your
father as much as you do.

21
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:40,264
We're not both equally responsible

22
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,899
for his absence, are we?

23
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:43,567
Hello, Aaron.

24
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:45,402
Your skint from the 'fugee camp

25
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:47,004
who assumed a Green Zone identity.

26
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,139
I can give you what you want.

27
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:50,641
Get me into Arcadia.

28
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:51,909
I can't let her die in that place.

29
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:57,614
You're gonna destroy everything.

30
00:00:57,616 --> 00:01:00,017
I can't let you hurt my family!

31
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,084
What happened?

32
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:02,352
He knew who I was.

33
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,821
Everything I'm doing

34
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:05,422
is for Elena.

35
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:07,598
I have a plan, Theo.

36
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:09,860
The body, the watch...
it's all going to help us.

37
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,361
You have to trust me.

38
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:17,326
Are you ready, Mr. Larson?

39
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:26,779
We're waiting.

40
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,646
Of course. Uh...

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,430
What's your success rate in
extracting actionable information?

42
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:46,273
The results are,

43
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:48,180
uh... p-promising.

44
00:01:48,205 --> 00:01:50,446
We've achieved success

45
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:52,871
across all data sets,

46
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:54,578
but, uh...

47
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:58,444
Ben?

48
00:01:58,446 --> 00:02:00,813
May I remind you your promotion

49
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:02,781
depends on this presentation?

50
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:33,412
Morning health scan.

51
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:35,714
Heart rate elevated.

52
00:02:35,716 --> 00:02:38,050
Cortisol and adrenaline surge detected.

53
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:41,915
Recommend guided meditation
or stress reduction.

54
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,772
Surety Servants offers the
very best in domestic health.

55
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:02,207
Our hand-picked staff
are specially trained

56
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:03,575
in cleaning, cooking,

57
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:05,475
shopping, and laundry.

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,333
We even provide pet care.

59
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:10,185
All this, plus real-time
monitoring of your servants,

60
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,118
gives you peace of
mind and a happy home.

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,754
You work hard. Let a Surety Servant...

62
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:17,975
Block Surety Servants.

63
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:20,686
Feel sorry for those weeds.

64
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,595
They have no idea what they're in for.

65
00:03:23,597 --> 00:03:26,131
Yeah, that's me.

66
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:28,120
Ruthless.

67
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:30,235
You're not ruthless.

68
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,538
You just...

69
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,140
do what needs to be done

70
00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:36,809
and move forward.

71
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:49,655
This is Rachel Brown.

72
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:50,819
Please leave a message.

73
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:52,057
Rachel,

74
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:54,793
I just wanted to see
how you were, and...

75
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:56,228
how the girl's doing?

76
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,934
Did she get her appendix out?

77
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,765
Call me, please.

78
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:05,205
Good morning, Dr. Larson.

79
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,997
What is your destination?

80
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:12,010
Drive to 2714 Center Street.

81
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:14,179
that address is located

82
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:17,015
outside of a secure corporate area.

83
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:18,418
Do you accept?

84
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:20,719
Do you accept?

85
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,822
Do you accept?

86
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:25,745
Hell yes.

87
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:28,471
- Whoo!
- Ow ow!

88
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:32,721
Ugh, can you please
put on some lipstick?

89
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:34,533
- I'm not sharing your lipstick.
- Yes.

90
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,502
You probably caught something already.

91
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:38,537
- I probably did.
- Ew!

92
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:40,038
Incoming call.

93
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,368
Hold on a second.

94
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:44,109
- I can't believe you just said that...
- Hey, Mom.

95
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,962
Our reservations are for
1:00 tomorrow at the club.

96
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,648
- Reservations?
- I swear I had orange.

97
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,550
Who wants orange eyes?

98
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:53,786
- Guys.
- The Rezas are in town.

99
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:55,521
We're meeting them for lunch, remember?

100
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:57,022
Right.

101
00:04:57,024 --> 00:04:58,524
Yeah, it'll be good to see them.

102
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:00,058
So what you doing this evening?

103
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,060
Not much, just, um...

104
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:03,495
we're gonna grab dinner.

105
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:05,268
Well, don't stay out too late.

106
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:07,633
The Rezas were such a
help after your dad died.

107
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:09,368
I don't want you falling
asleep at the table.

108
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,564
I won't. I promise.

109
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:13,572
I love you.

110
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:15,751
I love you too, Mom.

111
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,283
Which is better, gold or purple?

112
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:20,546
- Purple.
- Purple.

113
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:22,037
You don't like gold?

114
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:23,788
- It's okay.
- No.

115
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:27,019
Are you actually updating
your emergency contact?

116
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:29,855
- My dad is in Brazil this month.
- My God!

117
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,424
You are so paranoid.

118
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:33,792
Never hurts to be prepared.

119
00:05:33,794 --> 00:05:35,694
That mean you brought Spermishield?

120
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:37,714
Ooohhh.

121
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:39,144
- No.
- You did.

122
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,441
- No!
- Amani!

123
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,613
She definitely brought it.

124
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:02,383
Hey. Watch it.

125
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:08,894
- What is wrong with you?
- Trust me, this freak loves it.

126
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,762
Give me a poke, sweetheart.

127
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:12,030
Ugh!

128
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:14,900
Come on.

129
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:16,702
Jesus, Amani, get it together.

130
00:06:16,704 --> 00:06:18,704
We look like a bunch of greenbacks.

131
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:25,010
Or worse... narcs.

132
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:27,212
Unbelievable.

133
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:29,081
You know those guys?

134
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,146
My mom must've tracked my car.

135
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:36,604
I'm sorry, it's not like I
asked her to send bodyguards.

136
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:38,790
I'm gonna go dance.

137
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:43,061
Your mom was just looking out for you.

138
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:45,815
Come on, first drink's on me.

139
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,535
What about him?

140
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:51,770
He's hot.

141
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:54,740
- But I don't know.
- Why not?

142
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:56,275
He's definitely from outside the wall.

143
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:57,859
What if you catch something?

144
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,812
My God, you know you can't actually
catch Mumbai pox from dancing, right?

145
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,742
Okay, you know what I mean.

146
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:05,050
What is the point of coming all this way

147
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:06,652
if we don't even talk

148
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:08,587
to anyone who actually lives here?

149
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:10,358
Tell that to Marisa.

150
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:12,616
Nice.

151
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,627
God, she's so concerned that
we're gonna ruin her cover,

152
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:18,345
and she's over there
chatting up some Spiga D-bags.

153
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,330
I guess she's all talk.

154
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:44,536
I like a good girl with a wild streak.

155
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:46,959
Yeah, who says I have a wild streak?

156
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,027
I don't know. You're here, aren't you?

157
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:52,297
Sorry, I'm looking for someone.

158
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:54,026
You get the best of both worlds.

159
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,467
I help you scratch what itches

160
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:56,702
with no side effects.

161
00:07:56,704 --> 00:07:58,541
Get your hands off me.

162
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:00,291
Is there a problem here?

163
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,474
Fuck off, skint.

164
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:04,301
If I have to spill these beers,

165
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:06,243
you're gonna have a problem.

166
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:15,520
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

167
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:16,675
You shouldn't have to put up with that

168
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,940
just because you're the
prettiest girl in here.

169
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,315
You want to dance?

170
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:37,808
Come on!

171
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:42,540
We're used to it out here.

172
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:49,736
Hey, do you want to get out of here?

173
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,390
I thought you'd never ask.

174
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:52,657
Come on.

175
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,092
I know the way.

176
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:08,006
We lost them.

177
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:11,076
Oh, I have never done
anything like this before.

178
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:13,350
- Come here.
- Ah...

179

www.addic7ed.com

180
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:51,263
Got her watch, but I couldn't crack it.

181
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:02,230
Oh, great.

182
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:04,999
- Is she gagged?
- Yeah.

183
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:12,173
Think you've got a screamer, Bradley.

184
00:10:12,175 --> 00:10:13,882
I hope not.

185
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,100
Just keep it moving tonight.

186
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:40,301
Sure thing, Jimmy.

187
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:44,538
- Food's almost ready.
- Thanks, Ma.

188
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,207
Did you finish your math problems?

189
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:47,675
I already checked his answers.

190
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,036
He only missed one.

191
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:54,370
Nice going.

192
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:49,003
You cogs.

193
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:51,188
You all think I'm gonna rape you.

194
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:53,974
Well, let me tell you something.

195
00:11:53,976 --> 00:11:56,243
I don't want your greenback disease.

196
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:06,754
You had a high-tech
data guard on your watch.

197
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:09,749
But I still got your
emergency contact number...

198
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,991
Mom.

199
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:15,280
So now I just need one
more thing from you...

200
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:18,032
Your name.

201
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:21,760
Amani.

202
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:26,245
Amani Merced.

203
00:12:28,344 --> 00:12:29,886
Okay, Amani.

204
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:55,091
There's one small problem, Deputy Morse.

205
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:57,505
No one in the history of Spiga

206
00:12:57,507 --> 00:13:01,709
has ever requested a transfer
from Milwaukee to Sioux Falls.

207
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:04,378
It's about quality of life.

208
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,714
It's jumping off the corporate ladder.

209
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:09,016
Makes me think you're cracking up.

210
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:10,718
And that...

211
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,154
that'd be a big problem.

212
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:16,824
My wife would prefer a smaller town.

213
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:18,605
You just had a kid, right?

214
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:22,563
Mine are almost grown.

215
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:24,832
I remember when they were
just little bundles of meat,

216
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:27,776
screaming till I thought I'd go crazy.

217
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:30,433
That's what kids do.

218
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,776
You ever worry you just might snap?

219
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:37,144
No.

220
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:42,683
I heard that about you Oil War vets.

221
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:45,953
You're brutal and efficient.

222
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,776
But then you start to see
threats where there aren't any.

223
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:53,174
Is that what happened
with Captain Berman?

224
00:13:53,596 --> 00:13:56,363
You got overzealous maintaining
security in your unit,

225
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:58,632
and you just snapped?

226
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:01,135
I was cleared to return
to my full duties.

227
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:03,971
And no one has ever
questioned my loyalty.

228
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,541
Mm.

229
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:07,674
Certainly not Elizabeth Krauss.

230
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:11,338
You're one of the best
interrogators I've ever seen.

231
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:16,570
But there's no Quiet Room
in Sioux Falls, is there?

232
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:19,954
It'd be a waste of your
talents, don't you think?

233
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:21,822
I have other talents.

234
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:24,758
Ah, what we do in this room, Julian...

235
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,594
it's bloody, thankless.

236
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:30,349
But we do it for the
good of the company.

237
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,896
All due respect, sir...

238
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,974
I think I've done enough.

239
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,610
Chief Connor, there's a 12-01.

240
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:45,052
You're both needed, now.

241
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:50,150
This was your daughter ten minutes ago.

242
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:51,986
- Is she okay?
- For now.

243
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:55,029
For $50,000 blackcoin,
she stays that way.

244
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:57,525
We're lucky he asked
for a ransom... pay it.

245
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:00,137
We'll initiate containment-recovery
protocol immediately.

246
00:15:00,162 --> 00:15:01,224
Whoa, wait.

247
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:02,740
I'm sending an account number.

248
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:03,958
We'll put a tracker on the transfer.

249
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:05,990
When he opens the receipt,
we'll have a location.

250
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:08,029
This isn't a corporate abduction.

251
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:09,598
A CNR isn't necessary.

252
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:10,802
You have 20 minutes.

253
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,917
This looks like a
low-level grab-and-bag, sir.

254
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:14,174
Can't take the risk.

255
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:15,609
CNR is in effect now.

256
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:17,311
Assemble the tactical team...

257
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:18,646
immediately.

258
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:19,935
We don't get the money,

259
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,888
bad things start
happening to Amani. Got it?

260
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:26,427
Just authorize the transfer.

261
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:29,323
Are you listening?

262
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:30,935
Elizabeth.

263
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:33,431
Hey.

264
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:34,642
You can send the money,

265
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,822
or we can escalate this thing.

266
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:41,876
No.

267
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:43,504
I'm not paying.

268
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,424
- She said no.
- What?

269
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:53,446
- She said no.
- Her mom said no?

270
00:15:53,471 --> 00:15:55,181
Goddamn suits...

271
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:57,205
care more about money
than their own kids.

272
00:15:58,174 --> 00:15:59,541
Get the kit.

273
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:05,948
When a senior executive

274
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,442
or their immediate family is abducted,

275
00:16:08,953 --> 00:16:10,285
the protocol's clear.

276
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:11,653
You heard Julian.

277
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,489
This is not a corporate kidnapping.

278
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:14,823
You don't get to change the rules

279
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:16,325
just because it's your daughter.

280
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:17,927
He called her Amani.

281
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:19,828
She lied to protect her identity.

282
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,614
- He did, sir.
- I don't care what he said.

283
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,167
If you'd authorized payment,

284
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:26,602
the TAC team would be en route.

285
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:28,170
And Laura would end up dead.

286
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:29,338
You don't know that.

287
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,773
The priority for a CNR

288
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:33,041
is to protect corporate
intellectual property,

289
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:35,978
not save the lives
of kidnapping victims.

290
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,950
We'll do our best to make
sure she comes home safe.

291
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:41,950
No.

292
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:43,786
I will.

293
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:46,121
I'm overriding you.

294
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:47,322
You have a problem with that,

295
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:49,481
take it up with the fucking board.

296
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:58,300
The board will side with Connor.

297
00:16:58,302 --> 00:16:59,968
Get me assigned to the team.

298
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,804
I'll do everything in my
power to keep her safe.

299
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:03,071
That's not enough.

300
00:17:03,073 --> 00:17:04,840
Laura's watch was deactivated

301
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:06,375
outside the Red Zone club.

302
00:17:06,377 --> 00:17:09,792
You have to find her before Spiga does.

303
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:13,315
You're asking me to openly
defy chain of command?

304
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,166
When you helped me in the past,

305
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:17,686
I made sure that you were rewarded.

306
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:20,656
Connor doesn't want
to grant your transfer.

307
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,800
I can force his hand.

308
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:26,562
Julian, I don't even want to imagine

309
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:29,152
what they're doing to Laura right now.

310
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,011
But it'll be worse if you
don't get there before Connor.

311
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:37,906
Stall him as long as you can.

312
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:39,875
If the kidnappers don't
realize who she is,

313
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:41,210
we have a chance.

314
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,214
What are you doing?

315
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:46,582
What is that for?

316
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:48,217
Just remember this is your mom's fault.

317
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:49,284
No, no.

318
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:50,619
My mom wouldn't do...

319
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:51,887
Look, we have the money.

320
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:53,021
There's been a mistake.

321
00:17:53,023 --> 00:17:54,022
Don't forget the camera.

322
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:55,257
No, please, just...

323
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:56,391
just let me talk to her.

324
00:17:56,393 --> 00:17:57,593
Just let me talk to her, please!

325
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:59,194
Don't hurt me! No, please!

326
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:00,462
Shh.

327
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:07,703
- You hold her.
- What?

328
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:09,571
- No, I'll do it.
- I got it.

329
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:12,908
- You sure?
- Yes, Kim, I'm sure.

330
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,310
No!

331
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:29,925
Shh, shh.

332
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,557
- What the fuck?
- Jesus.

333
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,690
This is why I usually do it.

334
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:39,284
- You have to keep it on the ear.
- I am.

335
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:40,643
The hard part.

336
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,408
You got to be kidding me.

337
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,385
Oh, God. I need to stop the bleeding.

338
00:18:57,588 --> 00:18:59,282
Everything okay in there?

339
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,072
Yeah.

340
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:06,221
Jesus.

341
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:10,098
Are you okay?

342
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

343
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:13,101
I've got to transfer the video,

344
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:14,677
and I'll call Jimmy.

345
00:19:21,712 --> 00:19:24,271
Ma, go.

346
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:30,608
Shit.

347
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:33,221
Shh... it's okay, it's
okay, it's okay, it's okay.

348
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:49,192
Guess the last beer's mine.

349
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,844
A girl was kidnapped from the
Pocket Rocket about an hour ago.

350
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,546
I don't know anything.

351
00:19:57,548 --> 00:19:59,214
We both know how this works.

352
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:02,250
They nab somebody on
your turf, you get a cut.

353
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:04,553
Try a different answer.

354
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:06,488
Locust Street.

355
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,157
Big building on the corner of Edgecombe.

356
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:11,059
Apartment number?

357
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:12,661
There's, like, four
different crews in there.

358
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:13,929
I only know the building.

359
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,265
Oh!

360
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:51,343
There's some blood on the bear.

361
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:01,043
I didn't want your son to see it.

362
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:03,045
My son?

363
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:05,747
I'm not any older than you.

364
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:07,776
Do you have kids yet?

365
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:10,585
Sorry, I just assumed.

366
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:12,187
He's my nephew.

367
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:20,935
His dad died working
on a pipeline up north.

368
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:28,727
Then my sister was killed by some...

369
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:30,969
joyriding suit

370
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:32,891
in a hit-and-run.

371
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:35,751
Flatass didn't even stop.

372
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,213
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,579
My brother...

374
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:50,025
doesn't know to stay on the cartilage.

375
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:52,397
My other ear gets cut off,

376
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:54,149
it better be by you.

377
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:01,837
You should think about nursing school.

378
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,650
You'd be good.

379
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:04,818
Really?

380
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:10,178
Which corporate nursing school
would you suggest I go to?

381
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,837
No, I didn't mean it like that.

382
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:19,868
This is probably six months' rent.

383
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:23,095
This is how we get by.

384
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,228
Food's ready.

385
00:22:35,705 --> 00:22:37,472
Grab my paper for me.

386
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:47,122
What is it?

387
00:22:50,228 --> 00:22:51,987
Jesus.

388
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:57,171
We hit the goddamn jackpot.

389
00:22:57,196 --> 00:23:00,890
Bradley, don't send that video yet.

390
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:25,887
She wasn't kidnapped by Inazagi.

391
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:28,223
They realize who she is,
that's who they'll sell her to.

392
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:29,891
She has no corporate I.P.

393
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:31,626
But you do.

394
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:33,862
And they could use her to get to you.

395
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:37,347
Your daughter's ransom

396
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:39,935
is now 5 million blackcoin, Mrs. Krauss.

397
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:47,597
Could you turn that off, please?

398
00:23:47,941 --> 00:23:49,578
You have 20 minutes.

399
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,812
If you don't pay,

400
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:52,541
Inazagi will.

401
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:58,253
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

402
00:23:58,278 --> 00:23:59,744
We'll do our best.

403
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:03,959
Payment complete.

404
00:24:27,743 --> 00:24:28,914
Hello.

405
00:24:28,938 --> 00:24:31,205
They know who Laura is.

406
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:34,921
Has Connor deployed the team?

407
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:37,093
Gates authorized the payments.

408
00:24:37,272 --> 00:24:40,179
They have her location.

409
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:44,296
But I don't know where she is.

410
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:48,812
I'm closing in on her now.

411
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:13,266
No!

412
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,098
You're never gonna believe it.

413
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:21,867
The girl we nabbed...

414
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:24,369
her mom is the CEO of Spiga.

415
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:26,710
Don't want you to get dehydrated.

416
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:30,175
Don't worry.

417
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:31,943
Spiga paid.

418
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:33,460
We got 5 million for it...

419
00:25:33,485 --> 00:25:35,886
Looks like you're going home soon.

420
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,687
You did what?

421
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:39,234
Shit.

422
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,156
We caught a break and we took it.

423
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,890
You think this is a good thing?

424
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:49,348
You're an idiot.

425
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:50,546
Come on, Jimmy.

426
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:52,866
You can't just grab
someone that high up.

427
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:06,444
This is huge.

428
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:08,780
We took a risk, and it paid off.

429
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:10,694
Reverse course.

430
00:26:11,385 --> 00:26:13,485
It's 5 million blackcoin, Jimmy.

431
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:15,262
We can retire on this bitch.

432
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:16,388
There you are.

433
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,722
You think you're gonna retire?

434
00:26:17,724 --> 00:26:20,045
You're gonna get incinerated
down at the Firemouth

435
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,248
and end up in cut-rate cement.

436
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:27,232
Understand the problem...

437
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:29,747
Get the girl back, and
we're all we're all rich.

438
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:31,505
Spiga's coming, and they're
gonna kill all of us!

439
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,804
But we've got the girl.

440
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:34,606
They don't give a shit
if the girl dies too.

441
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:36,873
It's a goddamn corporate policy!

442
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:40,278
It doesn't make any sense.

443
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,047
Why would they pay...

444
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:45,951
The money is here, Jimmy.

445
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:47,752
If they were gonna kill us,

446
00:26:47,754 --> 00:26:49,505
they wouldn't have paid.

447
00:26:53,634 --> 00:26:56,317
All the corporations have
bounty hunters out there...

448
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,434
Spiga thinks she's been
nabbed by a competitor.

449
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:03,969
They'll pay ten times that!

450
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:06,124
And still burn this place down.

451
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:12,877
Someone that big, they pay,

452
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:14,713
and then they take out everyone

453
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:17,053
just to protect their
intellectual property.

454
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:20,764
Okay, so what do we do then, Jimmy?

455
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,381
What do we do?

456
00:27:24,406 --> 00:27:26,201
Only thing that'll stop them

457
00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:28,403
is if they're sure the girl is dead.

458
00:27:52,078 --> 00:27:54,653
Get your things, kill the
girl, and get the hell out.

459
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:56,621
They said not to kill anyone.

460
00:27:56,623 --> 00:27:58,217
I'm telling you...

461
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:08,400
No, no, Jimmy.

462
00:28:08,402 --> 00:28:10,192
This is our payday.

463
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:11,850
Jimmy...

464
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,739
Let's go. Now.

465
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:15,980
I'll be back.

466
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:20,472
What are we gonna do?

467
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,761
Kim, get your stuff. You heard him.

468
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:32,691
No, Ma, leave that.

469
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:34,859
I'm not leaving this behind
if we're not coming back.

470
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:37,208
We're coming back, all right?

471
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:42,536
But for now, we do what Jimmy says.

472
00:28:47,707 --> 00:28:49,630
Ugh!

473
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,881
Shut up.

474
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:05,590
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

475
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:07,926
Yeah, get all that... put it in here.

476
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,010
All right. Kim?

477
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:27,642
I'll take care of it, all right?

478
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:30,594
Get him out of here first.

479
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:37,548
Kim, let's go!

480
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:39,457
Kim?

481
00:29:40,693 --> 00:29:42,211
Kim.

482
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:06,251
Whoa.

483
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:07,915
You're safe.

484
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:10,134
No one's gonna hurt you.

485
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:12,703
I'm Julian.

486
00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:15,976
Your mother sent me to bring you home.

487
00:30:25,939 --> 00:30:27,587
Okay?

488
00:30:28,775 --> 00:30:30,554
We have to move quickly.

489
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:31,943
Let's go.

490
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,471
Hold your fire.

491
00:31:07,314 --> 00:31:08,680
The risk is contained.

492
00:31:08,682 --> 00:31:10,753
CNR is complete.

493
00:31:12,718 --> 00:31:14,652
Status of hostiles?

494
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:22,961
I eliminated all the targets, sir.

495
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:32,002
She needs medical attention.

496
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:43,319
Come on.

497
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,356
Hope your loyalty serves you well.

498
00:32:00,434 --> 00:32:02,231
Oh, Laura.

499
00:32:03,577 --> 00:32:05,936
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

500
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:07,260
Thank God.

501
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,864
It's okay. It's okay.

502
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:14,920
The doctor will fix everything.

503
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:16,211
It's gonna be okay.

504
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:18,186
Tell me what really happened.

505
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:20,805
You have to understand.

506
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:22,872
If I had paid them,

507
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:24,642
it would've made everything
so much worse for you.

508
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:27,045
No, not me.

509
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,780
Dad.

510
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:32,256
What happened to Dad?

511
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:34,334
Sweetheart.

512
00:32:34,988 --> 00:32:36,554
You know what happened.

513
00:32:36,556 --> 00:32:40,324
No, no, I know what you told me...

514
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:43,227
that you tried everything to save him,

515
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:46,108
but the rescue team
couldn't make it in time.

516
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,299
That's right.

517
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:53,116
You are such a liar.

518
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:58,309
Listen, you have had a very
traumatizing experience.

519
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:00,578
Even the kidnappers seemed to know

520
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,967
how Spiga deals with abductions.

521
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,350
Maybe the two of you
should speak privately.

522
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,941
Oh, why?

523
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,428
So that she can sell
me more of her bullshit?

524
00:33:09,453 --> 00:33:10,788
Laura...

525
00:33:10,813 --> 00:33:13,694
If the company saved people,

526
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:17,728
then you wouldn't have
had to send him to save me.

527
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:24,168
All these years,

528
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,572
pretending you were so devastated

529
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:30,041
they couldn't get to him in time.

530
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:31,776
I was devastated.

531
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:35,531
Did you really think that
I would never find out?

532
00:33:35,782 --> 00:33:37,093
You were only a child...

533
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:38,945
You owe me the truth!

534
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:42,787
I owe you? I risked everything for you.

535
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:46,124
Not just my career, but my life.

536
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:48,820
And I did it to save you.

537
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,397
Which proves you could've
saved Dad if you wanted to.

538
00:33:58,175 --> 00:34:01,509
Uh, the doctor is waiting.

539
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,447
Why don't we have her look at your ear?

540
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:22,219
You could've told her the truth.

541
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:27,272
She's safer this way.

542
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:31,836
Besides, she adored Paul,

543
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:34,138
and it's better that she hate me

544
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,207
than hate him.

545
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,077
I'm glad she's home.

546
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,793
Thanks.

547
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:47,218
And thank you for your
help with the transfer.

548
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,676
Oh, um...

549
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,459
I did everything I could.

550
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:58,095
Gates vetoed it.

551
00:34:58,537 --> 00:35:01,332
Connor's moving up the ladder,

552
00:35:01,334 --> 00:35:05,396
and when he goes, I'll make
sure that you get his position.

553
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,543
I never wanted his position.

554
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:18,349
You're the only one I can trust.

555
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,936
Can you tell me where it hurts?

556
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:33,968
My ear.

557
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,734
My arm.

558
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:39,147
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

559
00:35:39,365 --> 00:35:41,866
No need to apologize.

560
00:35:44,397 --> 00:35:46,633
- It's okay.
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

561
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:57,598
This...

562
00:35:59,301 --> 00:36:01,776
is the best part of the job.

563
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:12,992
You can't convince me

564
00:36:13,017 --> 00:36:15,434
that I don't have the
best job in the world.

565
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,410
See?

566
00:36:19,661 --> 00:36:21,636
It's like it never happened.

567
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,356
that address is located

568
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,692
outside of a secure corporate area.

569
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:36,283
Do you accept?

570
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,719
Do you accept?

571
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:41,242
- Do you acce...
- Yes.

572
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:53,344
An exit strategy?

573
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:57,995
To get Elena out, I need
to get Inazagi's attention.

574
00:36:58,628 --> 00:36:59,834
How?

575
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:02,674
I'm planning an operation based
on intel we got from a defector.

576
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:05,456
This should help move up the timetable.

577
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:07,385
You think this'll work?

578
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,378
It has to.

579
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:21,862
My dad was passed out in the hall
when I came home the other night.

580
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:24,299
You talk to him?

581
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,901
I've got nothing to say to him.

582
00:37:28,802 --> 00:37:30,573
He thinks she's dead.

583
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:32,698
Probably better that way.

584
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:42,510
In 24 hours, the geolocation signal
on Roger's watch will reactivate.

585
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:44,179
It has to be in place before then

586
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,643
so Spiga believes it's
a natural defection.

587
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:49,651
No problem.

588
00:37:50,787 --> 00:37:52,620
You have to get her out, Aaron.

589
00:37:52,878 --> 00:37:54,689
You do your part,

590
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,260
and I will.

591
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:01,066
- Hey.
- Hey!

592
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:02,630
How's your day going?

593
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:04,065
I've been better.

594
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:06,987
Just... tired.

595
00:38:07,637 --> 00:38:10,839
Well, you should go home
and lay on the couch...

596
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:14,008
watch some of those animal-clone
mash-ups or something.

597
00:38:15,232 --> 00:38:16,388
You hate that stuff.

598
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:18,480
I know, but I'm not there.

599
00:38:18,482 --> 00:38:20,009
Um, I have a patient.

600
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:21,816
Your office is closed, isn't it?

601
00:38:21,818 --> 00:38:23,084
House call.

602
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:24,853
I'll tell you about it later.

603
00:38:24,855 --> 00:38:26,370
All right.

604
00:38:27,257 --> 00:38:28,659
You okay?

605
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:32,471
Yes.

606
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,175
I am.

607
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:41,455
Ha!

608
00:38:43,494 --> 00:38:46,260
Two more... on her.

609
00:38:46,787 --> 00:38:48,587
You owe me, mooch.

610
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:50,912
Cash.

611
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:57,696
I'll have what they're having.

612
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:01,322
Only take real coin, kid.

613
00:39:01,324 --> 00:39:03,324
Unload your stolen dat somewhere else.

614
00:39:03,326 --> 00:39:05,041
Come on, man.

615
00:39:06,283 --> 00:39:08,163
Belonged to a Spiga suit.

616
00:39:08,165 --> 00:39:10,791
I'll give you the
watch... barter system.

617
00:39:11,802 --> 00:39:15,036
Psst... maybe we can help you out.

618
00:39:15,038 --> 00:39:16,471
With what?

619
00:39:16,473 --> 00:39:19,096
50 for the watch.

620
00:39:19,913 --> 00:39:21,313
200.

621
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:23,672
- No way.
- How do I even know it works?

622
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,485
It's a gamble, I guess.

623
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:29,713
75.

624
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:32,220
He was gonna trade it for two shots.

625
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:33,775
Shut up.

626
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:39,494
I bring them this, the
entire Inazagi board

627
00:39:39,496 --> 00:39:41,663
will fellate my toes.

628
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:03,958
Hey, come on, guys,
get back to work, 'kay?

629
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:05,063
All right, man.

630
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:07,459
Don't relax. Let's go.

631
00:40:12,629 --> 00:40:15,069
I don't work for you anymore.

632
00:40:15,565 --> 00:40:17,264
I know.

633
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,263
Take me to the girl.

634
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,819
