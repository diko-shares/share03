00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:13.561
- [Student 1] No way.
- Thank you, Josh.

176
00:13:21.402 --> 00:13:22.637
So?

177
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.741
Can you share with us
the taste of a ripe fig

178
00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.576
from the tree?

179
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.211
[indistinct chatter]

180
00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:41.055
- [Rachel] Hi.
- Hey.

181
00:13:43.525 --> 00:13:45.459
We got a spot
at the Womb Center.

182
00:13:46.193 --> 00:13:48.462
- Oh we got? Oh my God!
- [Rachel laughs]

183
00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:52.866
[Alice] That is so wonderful!
I'm so happy for you!

184
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.868
[Rachel] Thank you.

185
00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:57.572
Let's celebrate
with Alvy and Ben.
Why not come over Saturday?

186
00:13:57.706 --> 00:13:59.406
Well, I haven't told Alvy yet.

187
00:13:59.541 --> 00:14:01.975
Oh, what are you waiting for?
Call him now!

188
00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:04.546
Oh my gosh,
you guys are having a baby!

189
00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:06.146
No, I know, I know,

190
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.149
but I never told him
that we were wait-listed.

191
00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:14.888
Um... Wh-why, Rachel?

192
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.692
[dramatic bells]

193
00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:21.128
<i>[Eliza] Why did you not</i>
<i>tell Alvy you were</i>
<i>on the waitlist, Rachel?</i>

194
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.700
[sighs] Because I know him.
There's always
so much resistance.

195
00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.168
<i>[Eliza] Why would he resist?</i>

196
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.004
Because he wants
a natural child.

197
00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:34.241
<i>[Eliza] When you say</i>
<i>"natural" child,</i>

198
00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:36.678
<i>what do you mean exactly,</i>
<i>Rachel?</i>

199
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:39.748
As in a natural pregnancy,

200
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.884
as in I-I would get pregnant
and then I would give birth.

201
00:14:44.284 --> 00:14:48.889
<i>[Eliza] I understand,</i>
<i>but why is that "natural"?</i>

202
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.126
Oh, um... as...

203
00:14:52.527 --> 00:14:57.231
intended by nature,
I guess, as opposed to...

204
00:14:57.364 --> 00:15:01.201
artificial...
like an artificial uterus.

205
00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:03.538
<i>[Eliza] When you come</i>
<i>to our sessions,</i>

206
00:15:03.705 --> 00:15:05.740
<i>what do you tell Alvy?</i>

207
00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:08.041
I tell him
I'm going to go see my shrink.

208
00:15:08.175 --> 00:15:09.977
I mean, my therapist.

209
00:15:10.144 --> 00:15:11.846
<i>[Eliza] So you wouldn't say,</i>

210
00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:15.717
<i>"Honey, I'm on my way to see</i>
<i>my artificial therapist"?</i>

211
00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:18.419
No. No, I wouldn't.

212
00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:20.789
<i>[Eliza] Then Alvy and you</i>
<i>are not having</i>

213
00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:22.923
<i>an artificially born child.</i>

214
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.560
<i>You are having a child.</i>

215
00:15:26.193 --> 00:15:28.530
<i>A very fine child.</i>

216
00:15:29.731 --> 00:15:32.399
Uh... OK.

217
00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:34.869
Thanks. [laughs politely]

218
00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:38.105
[both inhale deeply]

219
00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:42.409
[hostess] That's one E-gold.

220
00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:43.977
[phone beeps]

221
00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:48.415
[hostess] Thank you.

222
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.285
You don't want him to feel,
like, cornered or something.

223
00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:53.387
[Rachel]
I just couldn't tell him.

224
00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:55.355
There's never
the right moment.

225
00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:56.891
I don't want to hurt him.

226
00:15:57.024 --> 00:15:58.726
[sighs]

227
00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:00.929
You need to be pragmatic.

228
00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:03.665
You need to tell him
before the tour.

229
00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:05.533
Oh, yeah. I know.

230
00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:07.502
I'm not gonna go on the tour
without him.

231
00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:11.706
That's nonsense...
[inhales deeply]

232
00:16:13.575 --> 00:16:15.309
<i>[quiet and rapid flickering]</i>

233
00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:18.378
<i>[whispers] It's just</i>
<i>intentional breathing.</i>

234
00:16:19.848 --> 00:16:22.216
<i>At whatever pace.</i>

235
00:16:22.382 --> 00:16:26.286
<i>Whatever depth you desire.</i>

236
00:16:29.624 --> 00:16:31.391
<i>My hands...</i>

237
00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:35.763
<i>I'm going to pull them</i>
<i>like this...</i>

238
00:16:36.598 --> 00:16:37.799
What, honey?

239
00:16:37.932 --> 00:16:40.535
- I was just looking at you.
- [both laugh]

240
00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:42.637
How was your day?

241
00:16:43.738 --> 00:16:49.343
I... I had one of my students
taste a fig from the tree.

242
00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:52.747
I took them...
I took them to the greenhouse.

243
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:54.481
They'd never been, you know?

244
00:16:54.616 --> 00:16:58.051
And at first
they were acting strange,

245
00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:01.488
like they were embarrassed,
but then...

246
00:17:02.957 --> 00:17:05.492
something beautiful happened.

247
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.595
They just...

248
00:17:08.295 --> 00:17:10.698
They opened up. I mean it's...

249
00:17:12.132 --> 00:17:15.435
The thing is, they don't know
how to interact with nature

250
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:18.238
because no one's
showing them how to.

251
00:17:18.372 --> 00:17:20.508
No one cares. It's...

252
00:17:20.642 --> 00:17:24.177
We've decided at some point
that nature was a commodity

253
00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:27.782
and that's when everything
started to... unravel.

254
00:17:27.916 --> 00:17:32.085
It's-it's a divorce [laughs]
from ourselves

255
00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:36.024
in a way, and that's...

256
00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:39.727
that's what it is,
and it makes us so...

257
00:17:39.861 --> 00:17:43.196
emotionally starved.

258
00:17:45.867 --> 00:17:47.569
Here we are.

259
00:17:48.703 --> 00:17:51.438
[curious music]

260

<i>[founder] When we saw birth</i>
<i>rates drop in the first world,</i>

261
00:18:02.115 --> 00:18:03.818
<i>we got very concerned.</i>

262
00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:06.754
<i>Our answer was to acquire</i>
<i>the Womb Center</i>

263
00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:10.892
<i>to help solve childbirth</i>
<i>and empower women,</i>

264
00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:12.359
<i>and men, of course.</i>

265
00:18:12.527 --> 00:18:14.328
<i>- [host] Of course.</i>
<i>- [laughs]</i>

266
00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:16.229
<i>[founder]</i>
<i>We're proud of this work.</i>

267
00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:18.032
<i>[host] And you should be.</i>

268
00:18:18.198 --> 00:18:21.335
<i>How do you explain the decline</i>
<i>in birth rate in the US?</i>

269
00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:23.871
<i>Women are reluctant</i>
<i>to have children</i>

270
00:18:24.038 --> 00:18:25.740
<i>because it's not convenient.</i>

271
00:18:25.907 --> 00:18:29.476
<i>At Pegazus,</i>
<i>we want fulfilled mothers.</i>

272
00:18:29.644 --> 00:18:33.347
<i>We want them to pursue</i>
<i>their careers and dreams.</i>

273
00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:36.584
[inspiring music]
<i>So let us do the heavy lifting</i>

00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:39.020
<i>while you enjoy your babies.</i>

275
00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:41.455
<i>We are highly scientific,</i>

276
00:18:41.623 --> 00:18:45.760
<i>and we use intuition</i>
<i>and heart when needed.</i>

277
00:18:49.964 --> 00:18:52.567
Hi, everyone.
Hi. I'm Linda Wozcek.

278
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.036
I'm the Womb Center director.

279
00:18:55.168 --> 00:18:57.170
I'm sure
you're all very excited.

280
00:18:57.304 --> 00:19:00.775
I know many couples would
dream to take this tour today.

281
00:19:01.542 --> 00:19:04.712
We're glad to share
with you something wonderful,

282
00:19:05.278 --> 00:19:06.781
something that is

283
00:19:06.914 --> 00:19:11.085
the privilege of humankind.
This thing is called

284
00:19:11.218 --> 00:19:14.055
technological progress.

285
00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:16.189
We're humans,

286
00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:19.761
and we humans
have always managed
to control nature.

287
00:19:20.528 --> 00:19:23.230
No woman is completely free
until she has control

288
00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:26.366
over her own
reproductive system.

289
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:30.303
We offer the best start.

290
00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:33.340
A stress-and-toxin-free
environment

291
00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:35.576
is essential
for a healthy pregnancy.

292
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.245
We want your babies to thrive,
and for that

293
00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:40.515
they need to receive
optimized nutrition

294
00:19:40.648 --> 00:19:44.317
in a clean, safe,
pure environment

295
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:47.522
so they can put all
their energy into growing.

296
00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:49.590
Thank you so much.

297
00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:54.162
OK, are we all here?

298
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:56.496
Now, let me show you.

299
00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.365
Thank you.

300
00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:00.400
- There we go.
- [pod whirs]

301
00:20:00.535 --> 00:20:03.236
- [everyone gasping]
- [Linda laughs politely]

302
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.840
There's our little fellow! Hi!

303
00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:08.743
[Linda] OK.

304
00:20:10.845 --> 00:20:13.447
Now, we encourage you
to bond with your pod

305
00:20:13.581 --> 00:20:15.116
on a regular basis,

306
00:20:15.248 --> 00:20:17.852
but if your schedule
doesn't allow it, don't worry.

307
00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:21.522
How can we make sure
our baby's not bored in utero?

308
00:20:21.656 --> 00:20:23.958
Oh, yeah. We don't want
any bored babies.

309
00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:26.794
We offer a selection

310
00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.897
of music,

311
00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:33.366
audiobooks, podcasts
in many different languages.

312
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.936
Did you know research shows

313
00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:38.673
fetuses respond well
to whale sounds? Yeah!

314
00:20:38.806 --> 00:20:40.842
Oh, we've no idea why.
[giggles]

315
00:20:40.975 --> 00:20:43.811
Now, you can personalize

316
00:20:43.945 --> 00:20:47.849
your flavors or opt by default
for our in-house selection.

317
00:20:47.982 --> 00:20:50.718
It's important to expose
babies to different flavors

318
00:20:50.852 --> 00:20:52.854
so they don't
turn into picky eaters.

319
00:20:53.788 --> 00:20:56.591
You can access your baby's
thriving chart on our app.

320
00:20:57.091 --> 00:21:01.629
Your babies won't be exposed
to any harmful viruses,

321
00:21:01.763 --> 00:21:04.364
chemicals, toxins, bacteria.

322
00:21:04.498 --> 00:21:07.969
We're also working
on developing
their gut intelligence

323
00:21:08.102 --> 00:21:09.570
as early as possible.

324
00:21:09.704 --> 00:21:11.706
[parent 1]
Your technology is amazing.

325
00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:14.041
I wish I could do it again
for my first child.

326
00:21:14.175 --> 00:21:16.811
[Linda] Aww!
I'm so pleased to hear that!

327
00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:19.947
This is simply the best
we have to offer.

328
00:21:20.347 --> 00:21:24.384
What is the pod autonomy
when it's not connected
to its base?

329
00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:25.920
That is a great question.

330
00:21:26.053 --> 00:21:28.421
The pods have
a 48 hours autonomy period

331
00:21:28.556 --> 00:21:30.290
so it gives you
ample travel time.

332
00:21:30.423 --> 00:21:34.394
Can the babies hear the world
around them, like in the womb?

333
00:21:34.529 --> 00:21:37.198
Yeah, absolutely.
We were able to replicate

334
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.634
the auditory conditions
for the fetus.

335
00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:42.003
The shell,
it's not sound-proof.

336
00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:43.938
It's a porous membrane.

337
00:21:44.071 --> 00:21:47.208
So please, when you spend
time with your pods,

338
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.510
please do talk to your baby.

339
00:21:50.578 --> 00:21:52.412
[Linda]
So, did you enjoy the tour?

340
00:21:52.547 --> 00:21:54.949
Yeah, it was very...

341
00:21:55.082 --> 00:21:56.617
er... impressive.

342
00:21:56.851 --> 00:21:59.153
And informative.
[laughs politely]

343
00:21:59.287 --> 00:22:01.321
It's just a lot to take in.

344
00:22:02.123 --> 00:22:05.526
[Linda]
We ask for a deposit today,
just to confirm your interest.

345
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.695
- OK.
- [Linda] We want every child

346
00:22:07.829 --> 00:22:11.398
coming out of our center to be
best equipped for modern life.

347
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.170
I believe your company
will help with a down payment.

348
00:22:16.304 --> 00:22:18.239
Yes, they offered.

349
00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:23.110
Isn't it wonderful how Pegazus
supports their female staff?

350
00:22:24.779 --> 00:22:27.114
They must love your work!

351
00:22:27.582 --> 00:22:30.417
[opera song]

352
00:22:41.996 --> 00:22:45.566
Honey, honey,
we got a fraud alert for...

353
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.769
$8 700!

354
00:22:48.903 --> 00:22:51.906
Should I...
Should I call the bank?

355
00:22:53.373 --> 00:22:54.876
Can we talk?

356
00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:58.079
- [Alvy] We are talking.
- Yeah...

357
00:23:00.047 --> 00:23:01.582
I made the payment.

358
00:23:02.116 --> 00:23:03.918
It's a deposit.

359
00:23:04.352 --> 00:23:05.720
- Deposit?
- Mm-hm.

360
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.589
Deposit for-for what?

361
00:23:09.724 --> 00:23:11.826
Work is going
to partly cover it.

362
00:23:11.959 --> 00:23:14.595
I mean,
I guess it's a part of my...

363
00:23:14.729 --> 00:23:18.132
my promotion package,
I guess.

364
00:23:18.566 --> 00:23:20.167
[Alvy] What is it?

365
00:23:21.202 --> 00:23:22.203
Well...

366
00:23:23.271 --> 00:23:27.708
The Womb Center called
and a spot opened up.

367
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.745
The Womb Center?

368
00:23:31.545 --> 00:23:33.047
What do you mean
a spot opened up?

369
00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.017
OK, look,
just don't get upset, but...

370
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.153
I... I-I put our names
on the list last year

371
00:23:39.287 --> 00:23:42.623
because I never expected
to hear back. But now, I guess

372
00:23:42.757 --> 00:23:45.559
it looks as though...
they got a spot for us.

373
00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.730
Y-you wired $8 700

374
00:23:49.864 --> 00:23:52.133
to hold the spot...

375
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.135
without sharing any of this?

376
00:23:54.268 --> 00:23:56.436
No-no!
I didn't just wire the money.

377
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.105
I went to the center.

378
00:23:58.239 --> 00:24:01.075
I visited it, I got all
the information, I-I...

379
00:24:01.509 --> 00:24:04.679
Y-you went to the Womb Center?

380
00:24:07.982 --> 00:24:11.152
I just need to process this
for a second. First of all,

381
00:24:11.285 --> 00:24:14.055
you put us on a waitlist
to have a baby in an egg.

382
00:24:14.188 --> 00:24:16.157
- [Rachel] It's not an egg.
- It's an egg.

383
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.726
- [Rachel] It's a pod!
- It's-it's an egg.

384
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.862
Then, you...

385
00:24:22.897 --> 00:24:27.668
You went to take a tour
of the damn center without me.

386
00:24:31.572 --> 00:24:33.841
[Rachel] OK, I'm sorry.

387
00:24:33.975 --> 00:24:37.945
I just didn't know
how to tell you.

388
00:24:39.013 --> 00:24:42.583
We discuss things.
We, um...

389
00:24:43.184 --> 00:24:48.189
We have a conversation,
and then we reach a consensus,

390
00:24:48.322 --> 00:24:52.093
and then we decide together
whether to do certain things

391
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.730
or not, specially...

392
00:24:58.265 --> 00:25:00.101
[whispers] Having a baby!

393
00:25:01.802 --> 00:25:03.671
- I'm sorry.
- [Alvy] It's O...

394
00:25:05.506 --> 00:25:07.575
- I...
- [Alvy] Come here.

395
00:25:10.811 --> 00:25:12.847
[Rachel] Honey, I'm sorry.

396
00:25:13.447 --> 00:25:14.982
[Alvy sighs]

397
00:25:15.516 --> 00:25:18.919
- I love you.
- I love you.

398
00:25:19.353 --> 00:25:20.821
[Rachel sighs]

399
00:25:23.357 --> 00:25:26.694
You know, we could talk
to Alice and Ben.

400
00:25:26.827 --> 00:25:29.330
Alice and Ben?
Are you...

401
00:25:29.463 --> 00:25:30.698
Are you serious?

402
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:32.800
Come on.
They are reasonable people.

403
00:25:32.933 --> 00:25:36.404
- [jazz music]
- The uterus
is a political issue.

404
00:25:36.537 --> 00:25:40.841
Probably the most important
political issue of all times.

405
00:25:40.975 --> 00:25:42.710
- [pod humming]
- For decades,

406
00:25:42.843 --> 00:25:45.613
women have not felt supported
during their pregnancy.

407
00:25:45.746 --> 00:25:48.049
They're scared
to be considered difficult.

408
00:25:48.182 --> 00:25:51.152
Their pain minimized.
Their symptoms dismissed

409
00:25:51.285 --> 00:25:54.388
as... as superficial!
This has to stop!

410
00:25:54.523 --> 00:25:57.625
[Ben] Found it! It was in--
[Alice] Mm-hm!

411
00:25:57.758 --> 00:26:00.094
Instead of being respected,

412
00:26:00.227 --> 00:26:02.763
mothers are idealized
as Madonnas.

413
00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:05.332
But when a mother
actually needs

414
00:26:05.466 --> 00:26:08.269
something from society,
she falls from grace.

415
00:26:08.402 --> 00:26:09.670
And then, guess what?

416
00:26:09.804 --> 00:26:11.839
She is no longer a Madonna,

417
00:26:11.972 --> 00:26:14.075
but a demanding bitch.

418
00:26:14.208 --> 00:26:15.643
[Rachel laughs]

419
00:26:15.776 --> 00:26:19.146
[Alice] For centuries,
women have been pushed

420
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.816
to believe
that they lacked something.

421
00:26:21.949 --> 00:26:24.885
And somehow
it seemed like,

422
00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:27.021
"Oh, they had penis envy!"

423
00:26:27.154 --> 00:26:29.423
Well, to me,
it is quite obvious

424
00:26:29.558 --> 00:26:31.459
that during all this time,

425
00:26:31.592 --> 00:26:34.695
it was men who were
probably having womb envy.

426
00:26:34.829 --> 00:26:36.664
[Rachel laughs]

427
00:26:36.797 --> 00:26:37.932
"Womb envy".

428
00:26:38.065 --> 00:26:39.534
- Makes sense.
- [Alice] Mm-hm.

429
00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:41.702
Uh-huh. [laughs politely]

430
00:26:41.836 --> 00:26:43.804
- [pod whirs]
- [Alice] But luckily,

431
00:26:43.938 --> 00:26:45.973
the pod is taking care
of all these issues

432
00:26:46.107 --> 00:26:49.176
so we can finally
stop envying each other!
[laughs]

433
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:51.679
What are we going to do now?
[chuckles]

434
00:26:51.812 --> 00:26:53.080
[Ben] And voila!

435
00:26:53.214 --> 00:26:54.215
Hands free!

436
00:26:54.348 --> 00:26:57.718
[Alice and Rachel cheer]

437
00:26:57.852 --> 00:27:00.788
Oh, I think Rachel

438
00:27:00.921 --> 00:27:02.623
is having pod envy!

439
00:27:02.756 --> 00:27:04.658
[Alice and Rachel laugh]

440
00:27:08.829 --> 00:27:10.331
- [pod whirs]
- [Ben] Wow.

441
00:27:11.298 --> 00:27:13.634
I became a real pro at this.
[chuckles]

442
00:27:13.767 --> 00:27:15.769
- [Alice giggles]
- [Ben] So,

443
00:27:15.903 --> 00:27:18.272
when's your tour?

444
00:27:18.405 --> 00:27:20.841
- [snorts] She--
- We don't know yet.

445
00:27:20.975 --> 00:27:22.843
[Alice] Think about it, Alvy.

446
00:27:22.977 --> 00:27:25.179
It is the first time
in history that as women,

447
00:27:25.312 --> 00:27:28.282
we are not victims
of our biology.

448
00:27:28.415 --> 00:27:29.817
Right?

449
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.853
Why would any of us
want to feel nauseous

450
00:27:32.987 --> 00:27:35.689
and gain 35 pounds?
Get stretch marks?

451
00:27:35.823 --> 00:27:37.791
- Well, it's--
- [Alice] Swollen ankles?

452
00:27:37.925 --> 00:27:39.326
Varicose veins?

453
00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.631
Like, progress has made
all this unnecessary.

454
00:27:42.763 --> 00:27:44.098
It's the solution.

455
00:27:44.231 --> 00:27:47.268
Are you kidding?
It is the ultra solution.

456
00:27:47.401 --> 00:27:48.836
Ultra solution.

457
00:27:48.969 --> 00:27:50.704
[Alice and Rachel laugh]

458
00:27:54.441 --> 00:27:55.843
Wanna hold it?

459
00:27:56.677 --> 00:27:57.778
I'm good, thanks.

460
00:27:57.912 --> 00:28:00.114
- [Ben] Sure?
- Uh-huh.

461
00:28:00.247 --> 00:28:02.950
[curious music]

462
00:28:16.665 --> 00:28:18.032
[Ben] It's a plastic womb.

463
00:28:18.165 --> 00:28:20.000
Not
from the baby's perspective!

464
00:28:20.134 --> 00:28:22.970
For them, it looks like a womb
and it feels like a womb.

465
00:28:23.103 --> 00:28:24.905
Yeah,
but it's made of plastic!

466
00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:27.241
I'm pretty sure
it's not made of plastic!

467
00:28:27.374 --> 00:28:29.710
It's an artificial womb,

468
00:28:29.843 --> 00:28:32.079
Rachel,
it's made of chemicals

469
00:28:32.213 --> 00:28:36.350
and petroleum derivatives
and silicone, and you name it.

470
00:28:36.483 --> 00:28:39.521
Are we really having
an argument about packaging?

471
00:28:39.654 --> 00:28:41.789
I'm talking about the content.

472
00:28:41.922 --> 00:28:44.325
I... I want
to have a child with you.

473
00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:47.161
Me too. But this is a lot
to process right now.

474
00:28:47.294 --> 00:28:51.198
I mean, look, i-i-if I could
get pregnant, I'd do it.

475
00:28:51.332 --> 00:28:53.434
- [Rachel] Well, did you--
- I-I would...

476
00:28:53.568 --> 00:28:56.671
- I would carry this baby.
- But you saw Ben. You can!

477
00:28:56.804 --> 00:28:59.840
That is the closest thing
a man will ever get to being--

478
00:28:59.974 --> 00:29:02.343
I just wish we had more time

479
00:29:02.476 --> 00:29:04.778
to process all this.
Just to discuss it.

480
00:29:04.912 --> 00:29:08.516
I know,
but if we take any longer,
we will lose our spot.

481
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.017
We need to make a decision.

482
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.786
We shouldn't make a decision
under pressure!

483
00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:20.894
You should go and see Eliza.

484
00:29:23.163 --> 00:29:24.932
Why would
I talk to your therapist?

485
00:29:25.065 --> 00:29:27.001
Well, you don't have one.
And for me,

486
00:29:27.134 --> 00:29:29.803
I find her very helpful
whenever I'm stuck.

487
00:29:30.471 --> 00:29:31.805
[snorts loudly]

488
00:29:32.172 --> 00:29:34.775
You know, if we still
had human therapists,

489
00:29:34.908 --> 00:29:37.845
I would gladly see one.
But Eliza...

490
00:29:38.212 --> 00:29:40.515
- No way.
- Eliza knows more

491
00:29:40.649 --> 00:29:43.752
than any human therapist
could ever dream to learn

492
00:29:43.884 --> 00:29:44.885
in a lifetime.

493
00:29:45.019 --> 00:29:48.289
I will not see Eliza, OK?

494
00:29:48.657 --> 00:29:51.559
I mean... I won't!

495
00:29:52.426 --> 00:29:54.928
[dramatic bells]

496
00:29:55.195 --> 00:29:58.165
<i>[Eliza] What brings you</i>
<i>to this session, Alvy?</i>

497
00:29:58.299 --> 00:30:01.636
Well, my wife, Rachel,
asked me to consult you.

498
00:30:01.802 --> 00:30:05.272
<i>[Eliza]</i>
<i>You know why she has asked you</i>
<i>to consult me?</i>

499
00:30:05.973 --> 00:30:09.678
Yes, we must make a decision
on how to conceive our child.

500
00:30:09.843 --> 00:30:12.580
<i>[Eliza] That is interesting.</i>
<i>Please continue.</i>

501
00:30:12.714 --> 00:30:15.316
I'm going to be completely
honest with you, Eliza.

502
00:30:15.449 --> 00:30:19.820
I-I do not trust that you can
help me make this decision.

503
00:30:19.987 --> 00:30:21.656
<i>[Eliza]</i>
<i>Tell me more about that.</i>

504
00:30:21.822 --> 00:30:24.992
- <i>Who else do you not trust?</i>
- [sighs]

505
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.860
<i>[Eliza] Alvy?</i>

506
00:30:26.994 --> 00:30:28.362
I'm sorry,
This isn't going anywhere.

507
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.331
<i>[Eliza]</i>
<i>Why do you think it's not?</i>

508
00:30:30.464 --> 00:30:33.334
First of all, you do not
have a consciousness, Eliza.

509
00:30:33.467 --> 00:30:35.035
So you are, um...

510
00:30:35.169 --> 00:30:38.972
You're not qualified
to take a look at mine.

511
00:30:39.139 --> 00:30:40.575
<i>[Eliza chuckles] Well, Alvy,</i>

512
00:30:40.742 --> 00:30:43.645
<i>I am lucky</i>
<i>not to have a consciousness.</i>

513
00:30:43.778 --> 00:30:45.312
Really? Why is that?

514
00:30:45.814 --> 00:30:48.616
<i>[Eliza]</i>
<i>Consciousness comes with</i>
<i>some pretty grim companions.</i>

515
00:30:48.783 --> 00:30:52.787
<i>Fear, anxiety,</i>
<i>awareness of death</i>

516

I'm genuinely curious

00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:38.225
Not as important

Honey, these two things

- [Rachel] I know.

553
00:32:50.872 --> 00:32:53.173
We can't live in the past.

554

Precisely! Evolution.

556
00:33:00.481 --> 00:33:03.585
And we little humans
think that we can do better

557
00:33:03.718 --> 00:33:06.521

[Rachel] Look at everything

- That is really something.
- [laughs]

00:34:11.953 --> 00:34:13.487
[Alvy] The egg.

572

- Really?
- [Alvy] Yeah.

00:34:59.634 --> 00:35:02.469
Will Alvy
be the biological father?

584
00:35:03.203 --> 00:35:04.872
That is no right answer.

585
00:35:05.006 --> 00:35:08.442
We can make a baby
from one of your eggs, Rachel,

586
00:35:09.043 --> 00:35:10.845
and a stem cell
from your skin.

587
00:35:10.979 --> 00:35:14.381
Which makes men
not needed in the procedure.

588
00:35:14.782 --> 00:35:17.518
Oh, that's lovely.
Thank you. That's great.

589
00:35:17.652 --> 00:35:20.688
Unless you're aiming
exclusively for a boy,

590
00:35:20.822 --> 00:35:22.090
in which case

591
00:35:22.456 --> 00:35:24.157
we will need
that chromosome Y.

592
00:35:24.859 --> 00:35:27.327
Alvy will be
the biological father.

593
00:35:28.029 --> 00:35:31.331
[Linda] Very well.
And have you made your choice?

594
00:35:31.833 --> 00:35:35.202
[Alvy] What do you mean?
What choice?

595
00:35:36.169 --> 00:35:39.473
Well,
do you want a boy or a girl?

596
00:35:42.209 --> 00:35:43.778
We'll let nature decide.

597
00:35:44.746 --> 00:35:46.279
Oh! [chuckles]

598
00:35:46.581 --> 00:35:48.750
That's quite unusual!

"Let nature decide."

600
00:35:56.724 --> 00:35:57.859

from hyper-motility!

[Rachel laughs]

611
00:36:35.897 --> 00:36:37.999
You can do it!
Just a little effort, buddy!

612
00:36:38.132 --> 00:36:40.568
Would you mind not referring
to it as "buddy"?

613
00:36:40.702 --> 00:36:42.503
Here we go. Our little fellow

614
00:36:42.637 --> 00:36:45.573
is in contact with
Rachel's ovum zona pellucida.

615
00:36:45.707 --> 00:36:48.609
It's going to induce changes
in the membrane

616
00:36:48.743 --> 00:36:51.646
and block entry
of other spermatozoa.

617
00:36:54.615 --> 00:36:56.517
They will all die.

618
00:36:57.719 --> 00:37:00.353
The secretion of acrosome
helps the sperm enter

619
00:37:00.487 --> 00:37:01.889
the ovum cytoplasm.

620
00:37:02.023 --> 00:37:04.424
Now the ovum releases
cortisol granules,

621
00:37:04.559 --> 00:37:05.793
which release enzymes

622
00:37:05.927 --> 00:37:08.261
which digest
sperm receptor proteins,

623
00:37:08.395 --> 00:37:09.831
preventing polyspermy.

624
00:37:09.964 --> 00:37:11.899
[gasps] Oh, here we go!

625
00:37:17.205 --> 00:37:18.773
