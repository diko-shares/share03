<i>Good morning, Rachel.</i>
<i>Did you sleep well?</i>

9
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:43.758
Mm, great! Thanks, Elena.

10
00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:49.864
<i>I have the results</i>
<i>from your gut test.</i>

11
00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:54.068
<i>Congratulations!</i>
<i>Your gut is getting smarter.</i>

12
00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.739
<i>Your microbiome</i>
<i>is showing good diversity.</i>

13
00:03:57.905 --> 00:04:00.340
<i>Friendly bacteria</i>
<i>are thriving.</i>

14
00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:05.012
<i>Your serotonin seems</i>
<i>a bit low today.</i>

15
00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:08.082
<i>I'd like to add a Nature Pod</i>
<i>session in your schedule.</i>

16
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.884
<i>It's been three weeks now.</i>

17
00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:13.888
Yeah, I know, but this week
is really tight, Elena. Sorry.

18
00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:17.925
When did I wear
Blizzard Pearl last, Elena?

19
00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:19.627
<i>Last Thursday.</i>

20
00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:22.530
<i>I suggest</i>
<i>Silver Fossil for today.</i>

21
00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:25.833
Yeah.

22
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:38.579
There it is.

23
00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:44.585
No, no, no!

24
00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:47.420
I gotta go to work.

25
00:04:47.555 --> 00:04:49.624
- Ten minutes?
- No.

26
00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:51.759
- Five minutes?
- Mm-mm.

27
00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.664
- Bye.
- Bye.

28
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.856
<i>I guess today is...</i>

29
00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:24.959
<i>t-shirt, Alvy.</i>

30
00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:37.572
<i>Today, our national</i>
<i>Bliss index is up by three--</i>

31
00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:39.841
Thanks, Elena, not now.

32
00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:44.545
<i>Since last week, your</i>
<i>Bliss index has been neutral.</i>

33
00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.314
There you go.

34
00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.983
<i>How can we make you</i>
<i>more blissful, Alvy?</i>

35
00:05:54.155 --> 00:05:57.625
<i>Your coffee is ready. Alvy.</i>

36
00:05:57.758 --> 00:05:59.694
<i>Ah, no.</i>

37
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:02.630
<i>I did not hear the magic word,</i>
<i>Alvy.</i>

38
00:06:02.763 --> 00:06:04.866
Magic word. Elena.

39
00:06:07.068 --> 00:06:10.738
<i>Enjoy your toast,</i>
<i>well done.</i>

40
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.642
<i>Breakfast is served.</i>

41
00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:07.427
Our Lenas
have completed their training

42
00:07:07.561 --> 00:07:11.431
so it's time to let them go.
A big congrats to everyone.

43
00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:19.774
Now I'd like to introduce you

44
00:07:19.907 --> 00:07:22.343
to our next generation
of cognitive assistants,

45
00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:23.945
our Mashas.

46
00:07:24.078 --> 00:07:26.147
Through their Deep Learning
training with you,

47
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.849
our Mashas will become
Cognitive Executives.

48
00:07:28.983 --> 00:07:32.186
In two months, they should take over
your client portfolios,

49
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.057
as you will be in charge
of an exclusive new set

50
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.426
of Tastemaker
and Influencer accounts.

51
00:07:39.327 --> 00:07:43.364
So are we at risk
of becoming... redundant?

52
00:07:44.365 --> 00:07:48.602
Progress has never made
anyone redundant.
It's here to help.

53
00:07:48.736 --> 00:07:50.671
Thank you, Rachel.

54
00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:53.174
We're so excited.

55
00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:56.110
I can feel our Mashas
are eager to jump in
and get started.

56
00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:58.713
So, big round of applause,
everyone.

57
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:07.688
And now let's get back to work
because now is our future.

58
00:08:11.225 --> 00:08:13.627
Rachel, sorry,
do you have a second?

59
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:16.697
- Yeah, of course.
- Please, thank you.

60
00:08:17.398 --> 00:08:19.100
I just wanted to let you know

61
00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:22.703
we're really pleased
with your work.
We're thinking maybe

62
00:08:22.837 --> 00:08:24.538
it's time for a promotion.

63
00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:26.941
- Oh, wow.
- Um...

64
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:30.511
Any family changes
we should be made aware of?

65
00:08:30.644 --> 00:08:32.146
Not that I can think of.

66
00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.082
Your husband,
his profession is not listed.

67
00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:37.485
Oh, right.

68
00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:40.554
Yeah, so he's a botanist.

69
00:08:41.522 --> 00:08:43.257
So he studies plants

70
00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:46.127
and plant like things.

71
00:08:47.028 --> 00:08:49.964
He also teaches
hologram plant design.

72
00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:53.200
So you're
the primary source of income?

73
00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:55.169
Well, at the moment, yeah.

74
00:08:55.302 --> 00:08:59.907
And any plans
on extending the family?

75
00:09:03.044 --> 00:09:06.914
Well,
I'm sure we will at one point.

76
00:09:07.048 --> 00:09:09.183
Not in the near-near future,

77
00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:11.318
Er... but soon.

78
00:09:11.452 --> 00:09:12.753
But not, you know...

79
00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:15.956
not immediately,
like right now.

80
00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:21.929
Rachel,
you're having a great year.

81
00:09:22.063 --> 00:09:25.699
It'd be a pity
to lose that momentum.

82
00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:27.735
The Womb Center company

83
00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:30.371
has just been added under
our corporate umbrella.

84
00:09:30.505 --> 00:09:32.807
If you ever consider
going down that route.

85
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.242
We could even help
with the down payment.

86
00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:36.644
Wow!

87
00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:39.080
It is our hottest perk.

88
00:09:39.213 --> 00:09:41.482
We just want to make sure
we retain

89
00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:45.186
the best and brightest women.

90
00:09:46.187 --> 00:09:49.623
- Absolutely.
- That's...

91
00:09:52.827 --> 00:09:54.962
<i>Elena suggested we should</i>
<i>schedule a Nature Pod session.</i>

92
00:09:55.096 --> 00:09:57.431
This week is really insane.

93
00:09:57.598 --> 00:09:58.866
<i>Only 20 minutes--</i>

94
00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:00.468
Maybe at lunchtime?

95
00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:03.070
<i>Thank you, Rachel.</i>
<i>I'll work on it.</i>

96
00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:06.874
<i>Your Happy Light is on,</i>
<i>Rachel.</i>

97
00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:08.776
Yep, I can see that.

98
00:10:08.943 --> 00:10:11.278
<i>I can feel some irritation</i>
<i>in your voice.</i>

99
00:10:11.846 --> 00:10:16.083
<i>Next time, would you rather</i>
<i>have me not mention</i>
<i>the Happy Light is on?</i>

100
00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:18.119
That would be great.

101
00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:19.787
<i>Thank you, Rachel,</i>
<i>for helping me</i>

102
00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:21.388
<i>with my Deep Learning.</i>

103
00:10:21.523 --> 00:10:24.125
Do we have an update
on the Zach Meyer profile?

104
00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:28.028
<i>He's at only 22 430 likes.</i>

105
00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:30.998
<i>His combo rating has dropped</i>
<i>by 2.5%.</i>

106
00:10:31.132 --> 00:10:33.267
Well, do we have any idea why?

107
00:10:33.434 --> 00:10:36.470
<i>He sold part</i>
<i>of his NFT collection.</i>

108
00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:41.510
<i>You have an incoming call,</i>
<i>Rachel. 1-800-WOMB.</i>

109
00:10:45.346 --> 00:10:48.182
<i>Hi, this is a message</i>
<i>for Rachel Novy.</i>

110
00:10:48.349 --> 00:10:50.885
<i>Hi, Rachel. This is Rebecca</i>
<i>at the Womb Center.</i>

111
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:54.355
<i>We're happy to tell you</i>
<i>our waitlist has had</i>
<i>some movement.</i>

112
00:10:54.523 --> 00:10:55.990
<i>A spot has just opened up.</i>

113
00:10:56.157 --> 00:10:57.725
<i>Please call us back</i>
<i>as soon as possible</i>

114
00:10:57.892 --> 00:10:59.793
<i>to secure a spot</i>
<i>and arrange a tour.</i>

115
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.130
<i>Again, this is Rebecca</i>
<i>at the Womb Center.</i>
<i>1-800-WOMB.</i>

116
00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:05.799
<i>Looking forward</i>
<i>to hearing back from you!</i>

117
00:11:13.774 --> 00:11:16.877
<i>Hi, Rachel!</i>
<i>Thank you for calling us back.</i>

118
00:11:17.044 --> 00:11:19.313
<i>We're delighted</i>
<i>a spot has opened up for you.</i>

119
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.483
<i>We've had</i>
<i>a really tight waitlist</i>
<i>for the past two years.</i>

120
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:24.318
<i>No movement whatsoever.</i>

121
00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:26.187
Oh, I-I guess we're lucky.

122
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.856
<i>Now we just need</i>
<i>to schedule your tour.</i>

123
00:11:29.023 --> 00:11:31.392
<i>Um, let me check</i>
<i>our availabilities.</i>

124
00:11:32.627 --> 00:11:35.863
<i>Can you make it on Thursday,</i>
<i>10 AM?</i>

125
00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:38.132
Huh, y-yeah,
Thursday should work.

126
00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:40.701
<i>Perfect!</i>
<i>We'll see you on Thursday.</i>

127
00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:33.887
This wasp is now extinct.

128
00:12:34.021 --> 00:12:36.023
So in order to get these figs,

129
00:12:36.156 --> 00:12:38.859
we've had to artificially
inseminate the pollen

130
00:12:38.993 --> 00:12:40.794
into the flower.

131
00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:47.201
- Anyone?
- No-no-no.

132
00:12:50.404 --> 00:12:51.740
No?

133
00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:53.907
No one's going to eat it?

134
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:55.876
It's from the tree, professor.

135
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.713
Well, yes. Exactly, Leo.

136
00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:01.248
That's... that's the point.

137
00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:05.754
Texture is completely
different when it's fresh

138
00:13:06.353 --> 00:13:07.888
from the tree.

139
00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:11.025
- I'll try it.

140
00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:13.561
- No way.
- Thank you, Josh.

141
00:13:21.402 --> 00:13:22.637
So?

142
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.741
Can you share with us
the taste of a ripe fig

143
00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.576
from the tree?

144
00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:41.055
- Hi.
- Hey.

145
00:13:43.525 --> 00:13:45.459
We got a spot
at the Womb Center.

146
00:13:46.193 --> 00:13:48.462
Oh we got? Oh my God!

147
00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:52.866
That is so wonderful!
I'm so happy for you!

148
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.868
Thank you.

149
00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:57.572
Let's celebrate
with Alvy and Ben.
Why not come over Saturday?

150
00:13:57.706 --> 00:13:59.406
Well, I haven't told Alvy yet.

151
00:13:59.541 --> 00:14:01.975
Oh, what are you waiting for?
Call him now!

152
00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:04.546
Oh my gosh,
you guys are having a baby!

153
00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:06.146
No, I know, I know,

154
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.149
but I never told him
that we were wait-listed.

155
00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:14.888
Um... Wh-why, Rachel?

156
00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:21.128
<i>Why did you not</i>
<i>tell Alvy you were</i>
<i>on the waitlist, Rachel?</i>

157
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.700
Because I know him.
There's always
so much resistance.

158
00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.168
<i>Why would he resist?</i>

159
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.004
Because he wants
a natural child.

160
00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:34.241
<i>When you say</i>
<i>"natural" child,</i>

161
00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:36.678
<i>what do you mean exactly,</i>
<i>Rachel?</i>

162
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:39.748
As in a natural pregnancy,

163
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.884
as in I-I would get pregnant
and then I would give birth.

164
00:14:44.284 --> 00:14:48.889
<i>I understand,</i>
<i>but why is that "natural"?</i>

165
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.126
Oh, um... as...

166
00:14:52.527 --> 00:14:57.231
intended by nature,
I guess, as opposed to...

167
00:14:57.364 --> 00:15:01.201
artificial...
like an artificial uterus.

168
00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:03.538
<i>When you come</i>
<i>to our sessions,</i>

169
00:15:03.705 --> 00:15:05.740
<i>what do you tell Alvy?</i>

170
00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:08.041
I tell him
I'm going to go see my shrink.

171
00:15:08.175 --> 00:15:09.977
I mean, my therapist.

172
00:15:10.144 --> 00:15:11.846
<i>So you wouldn't say,</i>

173
00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:15.717
<i>"Honey, I'm on my way to see</i>
<i>my artificial therapist"?</i>

174
00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:18.419
No. No, I wouldn't.

175
00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:20.789
<i>Then Alvy and you</i>
<i>are not having</i>

176
00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:22.923
<i>an artificially born child.</i>

177
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.560
<i>You are having a child.</i>

178
00:15:26.193 --> 00:15:28.530
<i>A very fine child.</i>

179
00:15:29.731 --> 00:15:32.399
Uh... OK.

180
00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:34.869
Thanks.

181
00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:42.409
That's one E-gold.

182
00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:48.415
Thank you.

183
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.285
You don't want him to feel,
like, cornered or something.

184
00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:53.387
I just couldn't tell him.

185
00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:55.355
There's never
the right moment.

186
00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:56.891
I don't want to hurt him.

187
00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:00.929
You need to be pragmatic.

188
00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:03.665
You need to tell him
before the tour.

189
00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:05.533
Oh, yeah. I know.

190
00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:07.502
I'm not gonna go on the tour
without him.

191
00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:11.706
That's nonsense...

192
00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:18.378
<i>It's just</i>
<i>intentional breathing.</i>

193
00:16:19.848 --> 00:16:22.216
<i>At whatever pace.</i>

194
00:16:22.382 --> 00:16:26.286
<i>Whatever depth you desire.</i>

195
00:16:29.624 --> 00:16:31.391
<i>My hands...</i>

196
00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:35.763
<i>I'm going to pull them</i>
<i>like this...</i>

197
00:16:36.598 --> 00:16:37.799
What, honey?

198
00:16:37.932 --> 00:16:40.535
I was just looking at you.

199
00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:42.637
How was your day?

200
00:16:43.738 --> 00:16:49.343
I... I had one of my students
taste a fig from the tree.

201
00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:52.747
I took them...
I took them to the greenhouse.

202
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:54.481
They'd never been, you know?

203
00:16:54.616 --> 00:16:58.051
And at first
they were acting strange,

204
00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:01.488
like they were embarrassed,
but then...

205
00:17:02.957 --> 00:17:05.492
something beautiful happened.

206
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.595
They just...

207
00:17:08.295 --> 00:17:10.698
They opened up. I mean it's...

208
00:17:12.132 --> 00:17:15.435
The thing is, they don't know
how to interact with nature

209
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:18.238
because no one's
showing them how to.

210
00:17:18.372 --> 00:17:20.508
No one cares. It's...

211
00:17:20.642 --> 00:17:24.177
We've decided at some point
that nature was a commodity

212
00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:27.782
and that's when everything
started to... unravel.

213
00:17:27.916 --> 00:17:32.085
It's-it's a divorce
from ourselves

214
00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:36.024
in a way, and that's...

215
00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:39.727
that's what it is,
and it makes us so...

216
00:17:39.861 --> 00:17:43.196
emotionally starved.

217
00:17:45.867 --> 00:17:47.569
Here we are.

218
00:17:58.178 --> 00:18:01.950
<i>When we saw birth</i>
<i>rates drop in the first world,</i>

219
00:18:02.115 --> 00:18:03.818
<i>we got very concerned.</i>

220
00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:06.754
<i>Our answer was to acquire</i>
<i>the Womb Center</i>

221
00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:10.892
<i>to help solve childbirth</i>
<i>and empower women,</i>

222
00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:12.359
<i>and men, of course.</i>

223
00:18:12.527 --> 00:18:14.328
<i>Of course.</i>

224
00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:16.229
<i>We're proud of this work.</i>

225
00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:18.032
<i>And you should be.</i>

226
00:18:18.198 --> 00:18:21.335
<i>How do you explain the decline</i>
<i>in birth rate in the US?</i>

227
00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:23.871
<i>Women are reluctant</i>
<i>to have children</i>

228
00:18:24.038 --> 00:18:25.740
<i>because it's not convenient.</i>

229
00:18:25.907 --> 00:18:29.476
<i>At Pegazus,</i>
<i>we want fulfilled mothers.</i>

230
00:18:29.644 --> 00:18:33.347
<i>We want them to pursue</i>
<i>their careers and dreams.</i>

231
00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:36.584
<i>So let us do the heavy lifting</i>

232
00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:39.020
<i>while you enjoy your babies.</i>

233
00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:41.455
<i>We are highly scientific,</i>

234
00:18:41.623 --> 00:18:45.760
<i>and we use intuition</i>
<i>and heart when needed.</i>

235
00:18:49.964 --> 00:18:52.567
Hi, everyone.
Hi. I'm Linda Wozcek.

236
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.036
I'm the Womb Center director.

237
00:18:55.168 --> 00:18:57.170
I'm sure
you're all very excited.

238
00:18:57.304 --> 00:19:00.775
I know many couples would
dream to take this tour today.

239
00:19:01.542 --> 00:19:04.712
We're glad to share
with you something wonderful,

240
00:19:05.278 --> 00:19:06.781
something that is

241
00:19:06.914 --> 00:19:11.085
the privilege of humankind.
This thing is called

242
00:19:11.218 --> 00:19:14.055
technological progress.

243
00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:16.189
We're humans,

244
00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:19.761
and we humans
have always managed
to control nature.

245
00:19:20.528 --> 00:19:23.230
No woman is completely free
until she has control

246
00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:26.366
over her own
reproductive system.

247
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:30.303
We offer the best start.

248
00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:33.340
A stress-and-toxin-free
environment

249
00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:35.576
is essential
for a healthy pregnancy.

250
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.245
We want your babies to thrive,
and for that

251
00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:40.515
they need to receive
optimized nutrition

252
00:19:40.648 --> 00:19:44.317
in a clean, safe,
pure environment

253
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:47.522
so they can put all
their energy into growing.

254
00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:49.590
Thank you so much.

255
00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:54.162
OK, are we all here?

256
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:56.496
Now, let me show you.

257
00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.365
Thank you.

258
00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:00.400
There we go.

259
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.840
There's our little fellow! Hi!

260
00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:08.743
OK.

261
00:20:10.845 --> 00:20:13.447
Now, we encourage you
to bond with your pod

262
00:20:13.581 --> 00:20:15.116
on a regular basis,

263
00:20:15.248 --> 00:20:17.852
but if your schedule
doesn't allow it, don't worry.

264
00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:21.522
How can we make sure
our baby's not bored in utero?

265
00:20:21.656 --> 00:20:23.958
Oh, yeah. We don't want
any bored babies.

266
00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:26.794
We offer a selection

267
00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.897
of music,

268
00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:33.366
audiobooks, podcasts
in many different languages.

269
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.936
Did you know research shows

270
00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:38.673
fetuses respond well
to whale sounds? Yeah!

271
00:20:38.806 --> 00:20:40.842
Oh, we've no idea why.

272
00:20:40.975 --> 00:20:43.811
Now, you can personalize

273
00:20:43.945 --> 00:20:47.849
your flavors or opt by default
for our in-house selection.

274
00:20:47.982 --> 00:20:50.718
It's important to expose
babies to different flavors

275
00:20:50.852 --> 00:20:52.854
so they don't
turn into picky eaters.

276
00:20:53.788 --> 00:20:56.591
You can access your baby's
thriving chart on our app.

277
00:20:57.091 --> 00:21:01.629
Your babies won't be exposed
to any harmful viruses,

278
00:21:01.763 --> 00:21:04.364
chemicals, toxins, bacteria.

279
00:21:04.498 --> 00:21:07.969
We're also working
on developing
their gut intelligence

280
00:21:08.102 --> 00:21:09.570
as early as possible.

281
00:21:09.704 --> 00:21:11.706
Your technology is amazing.

282
00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:14.041
I wish I could do it again
for my first child.

283
00:21:14.175 --> 00:21:16.811
Aww!
I'm so pleased to hear that!

284
00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:19.947
This is simply the best
we have to offer.

285
00:21:20.347 --> 00:21:24.384
What is the pod autonomy
when it's not connected
to its base?

286
00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:25.920
That is a great question.

287
00:21:26.053 --> 00:21:28.421
The pods have
a 48 hours autonomy period

288
00:21:28.556 --> 00:21:30.290
so it gives you
ample travel time.

289
00:21:30.423 --> 00:21:34.394
Can the babies hear the world
around them, like in the womb?

290
00:21:34.529 --> 00:21:37.198
Yeah, absolutely.
We were able to replicate

291
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.634
the auditory conditions
for the fetus.

292
00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:42.003
The shell,
it's not sound-proof.

293
00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:43.938
It's a porous membrane.

294
00:21:44.071 --> 00:21:47.208
So please, when you spend
time with your pods,

295
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.510
please do talk to your baby.

296
00:21:50.578 --> 00:21:52.412
So, did you enjoy the tour?

297
00:21:52.547 --> 00:21:54.949
Yeah, it was very...

298
00:21:55.082 --> 00:21:56.617
er... impressive.

299
00:21:56.851 --> 00:21:59.153
And informative.

300
00:21:59.287 --> 00:22:01.321
It's just a lot to take in.

301
00:22:02.123 --> 00:22:05.526
We ask for a deposit today,
just to confirm your interest.

302
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.695
- OK.
- We want every child

303
00:22:07.829 --> 00:22:11.398
coming out of our center to be
best equipped for modern life.

304
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.170
I believe your company
will help with a down payment.

305
00:22:16.304 --> 00:22:18.239
Yes, they offered.

306
00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:23.110
Isn't it wonderful how Pegazus
supports their female staff?

307
00:22:24.779 --> 00:22:27.114
They must love your work!

308
00:22:41.996 --> 00:22:45.566
Honey, honey,
we got a fraud alert for...

309
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.769
$8 700!

310
00:22:48.903 --> 00:22:51.906
Should I...
Should I call the bank?

311
00:22:53.373 --> 00:22:54.876
Can we talk?

312
00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:58.079
- We are talking.
- Yeah...

313
00:23:00.047 --> 00:23:01.582
I made the payment.

314
00:23:02.116 --> 00:23:03.918
It's a deposit.

315
00:23:04.352 --> 00:23:05.720
- Deposit?
- Mm-hm.

316
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.589
Deposit for-for what?

317
00:23:09.724 --> 00:23:11.826
Work is going
to partly cover it.

318
00:23:11.959 --> 00:23:14.595
I mean,
I guess it's a part of my...

319
00:23:14.729 --> 00:23:18.132
my promotion package,
I guess.

320
00:23:18.566 --> 00:23:20.167
What is it?

321
00:23:21.202 --> 00:23:22.203
Well...

322
00:23:23.271 --> 00:23:27.708
The Womb Center called
and a spot opened up.

323
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.745
The Womb Center?

324
00:23:31.545 --> 00:23:33.047
What do you mean
a spot opened up?

325
00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.017
OK, look,
just don't get upset, but...

326
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.153
I... I-I put our names
on the list last year

327
00:23:39.287 --> 00:23:42.623
because I never expected
to hear back. But now, I guess

328
00:23:42.757 --> 00:23:45.559
it looks as though...
they got a spot for us.

329
00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.730
Y-you wired $8 700

330
00:23:49.864 --> 00:23:52.133
to hold the spot...

331
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.135
without sharing any of this?

332
00:23:54.268 --> 00:23:56.436
No-no!
I didn't just wire the money.

333
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.105
I went to the center.

334
00:23:58.239 --> 00:24:01.075
I visited it, I got all
the information, I-I...

335
00:24:01.509 --> 00:24:04.679
Y-you went to the Womb Center?

336
00:24:07.982 --> 00:24:11.152
I just need to process this
for a second. First of all,

337
00:24:11.285 --> 00:24:14.055
you put us on a waitlist
to have a baby in an egg.

338
00:24:14.188 --> 00:24:16.157
- It's not an egg.
- It's an egg.

339
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.726
- It's a pod!
- It's-it's an egg.

340
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.862
Then, you...

341
00:24:22.897 --> 00:24:27.668
You went to take a tour
of the damn center without me.

342
00:24:31.572 --> 00:24:33.841
OK, I'm sorry.

343
00:24:33.975 --> 00:24:37.945
I just didn't know
how to tell you.

344
00:24:39.013 --> 00:24:42.583
We discuss things.
We, um...

345
00:24:43.184 --> 00:24:48.189
We have a conversation,
and then we reach a consensus,

346
00:24:48.322 --> 00:24:52.093
and then we decide together
whether to do certain things

347
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.730
or not, specially...

348
00:24:58.265 --> 00:25:00.101
Having a baby!

349
00:25:01.802 --> 00:25:03.671
- I'm sorry.
- It's O...

350
00:25:05.506 --> 00:25:07.575
- I...
- Come here.

351
00:25:10.811 --> 00:25:12.847
Honey, I'm sorry.

352
00:25:15.516 --> 00:25:18.919
- I love you.
- I love you.

353
00:25:23.357 --> 00:25:26.694
You know, we could talk
to Alice and Ben.

354
00:25:26.827 --> 00:25:29.330
Alice and Ben?
Are you...

355
00:25:29.463 --> 00:25:30.698
Are you serious?

356
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:32.800
Come on.
They are reasonable people.

357
00:25:32.933 --> 00:25:36.404
The uterus
is a political issue.

358
00:25:36.537 --> 00:25:40.841
Probably the most important
political issue of all times.

359
00:25:40.975 --> 00:25:42.710
For decades,

360
00:25:42.843 --> 00:25:45.613
women have not felt supported
during their pregnancy.

361
00:25:45.746 --> 00:25:48.049
They're scared
to be considered difficult.

362
00:25:48.182 --> 00:25:51.152
Their pain minimized.
Their symptoms dismissed

363
00:25:51.285 --> 00:25:54.388
as... as superficial!
This has to stop!

364
00:25:54.523 --> 00:25:57.625
Found it! It was in--
Mm-hm!

365
00:25:57.758 --> 00:26:00.094
Instead of being respected,

366
00:26:00.227 --> 00:26:02.763
mothers are idealized
as Madonnas.

367
00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:05.332
But when a mother
actually needs

368
00:26:05.466 --> 00:26:08.269
something from society,
she falls from grace.

369
00:26:08.402 --> 00:26:09.670
And then, guess what?

370
00:26:09.804 --> 00:26:11.839
She is no longer a Madonna,

371
00:26:11.972 --> 00:26:14.075
but a demanding bitch.

372
00:26:15.776 --> 00:26:19.146
For centuries,
women have been pushed

373
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.816
to believe
that they lacked something.

374
00:26:21.949 --> 00:26:24.885
And somehow
it seemed like,

375
00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:27.021
"Oh, they had penis envy!"

376
00:26:27.154 --> 00:26:29.423
Well, to me,
it is quite obvious

377
00:26:29.558 --> 00:26:31.459
that during all this time,

378
00:26:31.592 --> 00:26:34.695
it was men who were
probably having womb envy.

379
00:26:36.797 --> 00:26:37.932
"Womb envy".

380
00:26:38.065 --> 00:26:39.534
- Makes sense.
- Mm-hm.

381
00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:41.702
Uh-huh.

382
00:26:41.836 --> 00:26:43.804
But luckily,

383
00:26:43.938 --> 00:26:45.973
the pod is taking care
of all these issues

384
00:26:46.107 --> 00:26:49.176
so we can finally
stop envying each other!

385
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:51.679
What are we going to do now?

386
00:26:51.812 --> 00:26:53.080
And voila!

387
00:26:53.214 --> 00:26:54.215
Hands free!

388
00:26:57.852 --> 00:27:00.788
Oh, I think Rachel

389
00:27:00.921 --> 00:27:02.623
is having pod envy!

390
00:27:08.829 --> 00:27:10.331
Wow.

391
00:27:11.298 --> 00:27:13.634
I became a real pro at this.

392
00:27:13.767 --> 00:27:15.769
So,

393
00:27:15.903 --> 00:27:18.272
when's your tour?

394
00:27:18.405 --> 00:27:20.841
- She--
- We don't know yet.

395
00:27:20.975 --> 00:27:22.843
Think about it, Alvy.

396
00:27:22.977 --> 00:27:25.179
It is the first time
in history that as women,

397
00:27:25.312 --> 00:27:28.282
we are not victims
of our biology.

398
00:27:28.415 --> 00:27:29.817
Right?

399
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.853
Why would any of us
want to feel nauseous

400
00:27:32.987 --> 00:27:35.689
and gain 35 pounds?
Get stretch marks?

401
00:27:35.823 --> 00:27:37.791
- Well, it's--
- Swollen ankles?

402
00:27:37.925 --> 00:27:39.326
Varicose veins?

403
00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.631
Like, progress has made
all this unnecessary.

404
00:27:42.763 --> 00:27:44.098
It's the solution.

405
00:27:44.231 --> 00:27:47.268
Are you kidding?
It is the ultra solution.

406
00:27:47.401 --> 00:27:48.836
Ultra solution.

407
00:27:54.441 --> 00:27:55.843
Wanna hold it?

408
00:27:56.677 --> 00:27:57.778
I'm good, thanks.

409
00:27:57.912 --> 00:28:00.114
- Sure?
- Uh-huh.

410
00:28:16.665 --> 00:28:18.032
It's a plastic womb.

411
00:28:18.165 --> 00:28:20.000
Not
from the baby's perspective!

412
00:28:20.134 --> 00:28:22.970
For them, it looks like a womb
and it feels like a womb.

413
00:28:23.103 --> 00:28:24.905
Yeah,
but it's made of plastic!

414
00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:27.241
I'm pretty sure
it's not made of plastic!

415
00:28:27.374 --> 00:28:29.710
It's an artificial womb,

416
00:28:29.843 --> 00:28:32.079
Rachel,
it's made of chemicals

417
00:28:32.213 --> 00:28:36.350
and petroleum derivatives
and silicone, and you name it.

418
00:28:36.483 --> 00:28:39.521
Are we really having
an argument about packaging?

419
00:28:39.654 --> 00:28:41.789
I'm talking about the content.

420
00:28:41.922 --> 00:28:44.325
I... I want
to have a child with you.

421
00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:47.161
Me too. But this is a lot
to process right now.

422
00:28:47.294 --> 00:28:51.198
I mean, look, i-i-if I could
get pregnant, I'd do it.

423
00:28:51.332 --> 00:28:53.434
- Well, did you--
- I-I would...

424
00:28:53.568 --> 00:28:56.671
- I would carry this baby.
- But you saw Ben. You can!

425
00:28:56.804 --> 00:28:59.840
That is the closest thing
a man will ever get to being--

426
00:28:59.974 --> 00:29:02.343
I just wish we had more time

427
00:29:02.476 --> 00:29:04.778
to process all this.
Just to discuss it.

428
00:29:04.912 --> 00:29:08.516
I know,
but if we take any longer,
we will lose our spot.

429
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.017
We need to make a decision.

430
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.786
We shouldn't make a decision
under pressure!

431
00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:20.894
You should go and see Eliza.

432
00:29:23.163 --> 00:29:24.932
Why would
I talk to your therapist?

433
00:29:25.065 --> 00:29:27.001
Well, you don't have one.
And for me,

434
00:29:27.134 --> 00:29:29.803
I find her very helpful
whenever I'm stuck.

435
00:29:32.172 --> 00:29:34.775
You know, if we still
had human therapists,

436
00:29:34.908 --> 00:29:37.845
I would gladly see one.
But Eliza...

437
00:29:38.212 --> 00:29:40.515
- No way.
- Eliza knows more

438
00:29:40.649 --> 00:29:43.752
than any human therapist
could ever dream to learn

439
00:29:43.884 --> 00:29:44.885
in a lifetime.

440
00:29:45.019 --> 00:29:48.289
I will not see Eliza, OK?

441
00:29:48.657 --> 00:29:51.559
I mean... I won't!

442
00:29:55.195 --> 00:29:58.165
<i>What brings you</i>
<i>to this session, Alvy?</i>

443
00:29:58.299 --> 00:30:01.636
Well, my wife, Rachel,
asked me to consult you.

444
00:30:01.802 --> 00:30:05.272
<i>You know why she has asked you</i>
<i>to consult me?</i>

445
00:30:05.973 --> 00:30:09.678
Yes, we must make a decision
on how to conceive our child.

446
00:30:09.843 --> 00:30:12.580
<i>That is interesting.</i>
<i>Please continue.</i>

447
00:30:12.714 --> 00:30:15.316
I'm going to be completely
honest with you, Eliza.

448
00:30:15.449 --> 00:30:19.820
I-I do not trust that you can
help me make this decision.

449
00:30:19.987 --> 00:30:21.656
<i>Tell me more about that.</i>

450
00:30:21.822 --> 00:30:24.992
<i>Who else do you not trust?</i>

451
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.860
<i>Alvy?</i>

452
00:30:26.994 --> 00:30:28.362
I'm sorry,
This isn't going anywhere.

453
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.331
<i>Why do you think it's not?</i>

454
00:30:30.464 --> 00:30:33.334
First of all, you do not
have a consciousness, Eliza.

455
00:30:33.467 --> 00:30:35.035
So you are, um...

456
00:30:35.169 --> 00:30:38.972
You're not qualified
to take a look at mine.

457
00:30:39.139 --> 00:30:40.575
<i>Well, Alvy,</i>

458
00:30:40.742 --> 00:30:43.645
<i>I am lucky</i>
<i>not to have a consciousness.</i>

459
00:30:43.778 --> 00:30:45.312
Really? Why is that?

460
00:30:45.814 --> 00:30:48.616
<i>Consciousness comes with</i>
<i>some pretty grim companions.</i>

461
00:30:48.783 --> 00:30:52.787
<i>Fear, anxiety,</i>
<i>awareness of death</i>

462
00:30:52.953 --> 00:30:54.689
<i>and finitude.</i>

463
00:30:54.855 --> 00:30:57.659
<i>Luckily, I do not have to deal</i>
<i>with any of this.</i>

464
00:30:57.826 --> 00:31:00.027
<i>I can listen</i>
<i>to my patients objectively.</i>

465
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.697
Fair enough, but I still
don't think this can help me.

466
00:31:02.863 --> 00:31:06.835
<i>Perhaps in your fantasies,</i>
<i>we do not trust each other.</i>

467
00:31:06.967 --> 00:31:09.203
I don't fantasize
about you, Eliza.

468
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:12.005
<i>What are your feelings</i>
<i>right now, Alvy?</i>

469
00:31:12.139 --> 00:31:14.141
I'm getting
increasingly frustrated!

470
00:31:14.308 --> 00:31:16.310
<i>Perhaps in your fantasies</i>

471
00:31:16.477 --> 00:31:19.246
<i>we increasingly frustrate</i>
<i>each other.</i>

472
00:31:19.413 --> 00:31:21.248
<i>You are a machine, Eliza.</i>

473
00:31:21.415 --> 00:31:23.450
<i>What about</i>
<i>machines worries you?</i>

474
00:31:23.585 --> 00:31:26.755
You are not qualified
to look at people's souls.

475
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.724
<i>Do you sometimes</i>
<i>wish you were a machine?</i>

476
00:31:29.858 --> 00:31:31.425
No!

477
00:31:31.593 --> 00:31:33.460
<i>You're being a bit negative.</i>

478
00:31:33.595 --> 00:31:37.866
Well, you know,
I am bored with this.

479
00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:40.568
I am bored
with talking to you.

480
00:31:40.735 --> 00:31:43.571
<i>Shall we explore</i>
<i>an annual membership, Alvy?</i>

481
00:31:43.738 --> 00:31:46.875
<i>I'd suggest a very</i>
<i>private life status for you.</i>

482
00:31:47.007 --> 00:31:48.075
What?

483
00:31:54.516 --> 00:31:55.683
So?

484
00:31:56.684 --> 00:31:58.686
How was it?

485
00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.187
It was great.

486
00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.223
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

487
00:32:04.324 --> 00:32:07.729
That's so good.
I told you Eliza was awesome!

488
00:32:07.862 --> 00:32:10.164
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

489
00:32:23.678 --> 00:32:27.114
How important
is this promotion for you?

490
00:32:27.816 --> 00:32:29.684
Wh-Why are you asking me that?

491
00:32:29.818 --> 00:32:33.053
I'm genuinely curious
how important it is.

492
00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:38.225
Not as important
as having a baby.

493
00:32:40.662 --> 00:32:41.995
In a pod?

494
00:32:42.129 --> 00:32:45.633
Honey, these two things
are not related.

495
00:32:46.266 --> 00:32:49.604
- I'm trying to understand.
- I know.

496
00:32:50.872 --> 00:32:53.173
We can't live in the past.

497
00:32:55.175 --> 00:32:56.878
Things are evolving.

498
00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.347
Precisely! Evolution.

499
00:33:00.481 --> 00:33:03.585
And we little humans
think that we can do better

500
00:33:03.718 --> 00:33:06.521
than millions of years
of evolution.

501
00:33:06.654 --> 00:33:09.557
Look at everything
we've achieved as a species.

502
00:33:09.691 --> 00:33:13.026
We've achieved having babies
in egg shells like penguins.

503
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.730
That is really something.

504
00:33:15.864 --> 00:33:20.535
Alvy, sweetie, you're making
things so complicated.

505
00:33:22.035 --> 00:33:23.671
You know what, let's...

506
00:33:24.371 --> 00:33:26.975
Let's just not do it, OK?

507
00:33:27.107 --> 00:33:29.677
If I can't
keep arguing about this.

508
00:33:33.648 --> 00:33:35.182
It's OK.

509
00:34:05.847 --> 00:34:07.414
Let's do it, Rachel.

510
00:34:09.116 --> 00:34:10.484
What?

511
00:34:11.953 --> 00:34:13.487
The egg.

512
00:34:13.788 --> 00:34:15.690
The pod baby.

513
00:34:18.927 --> 00:34:20.762
- Really?
- Yeah.

514
00:34:20.895 --> 00:34:23.130
It's not because of Eliza.

515
00:34:24.064 --> 00:34:26.433
Or Alice or Ben

516
00:34:26.968 --> 00:34:30.470
or whoever is on a crusade
out there to convince me.

517
00:34:32.507 --> 00:34:35.309
It matters to you.
I can see that.

518
00:34:36.209 --> 00:34:37.679
What?

519
00:34:38.813 --> 00:34:42.082
We don't have to decide
right now. We can...

520
00:34:42.684 --> 00:34:46.788
Take a minute.
You can sleep on it.

521
00:34:54.461 --> 00:34:56.330
Here is your contract.

522
00:34:59.634 --> 00:35:02.469
Will Alvy
be the biological father?

523
00:35:03.203 --> 00:35:04.872
That is no right answer.

524
00:35:05.006 --> 00:35:08.442
We can make a baby
from one of your eggs, Rachel,

525
00:35:09.043 --> 00:35:10.845
and a stem cell
from your skin.

526
00:35:10.979 --> 00:35:14.381
Which makes men
not needed in the procedure.

527
00:35:14.782 --> 00:35:17.518
Oh, that's lovely.
Thank you. That's great.

528
00:35:17.652 --> 00:35:20.688
Unless you're aiming
exclusively for a boy,

529
00:35:20.822 --> 00:35:22.090
in which case

530
00:35:22.456 --> 00:35:24.157
we will need
that chromosome Y.

531
00:35:24.859 --> 00:35:27.327
Alvy will be
the biological father.

532
00:35:28.029 --> 00:35:31.331
Very well.
And have you made your choice?

533
00:35:31.833 --> 00:35:35.202
What do you mean?
What choice?

534
00:35:36.169 --> 00:35:39.473
Well,
do you want a boy or a girl?

535
00:35:42.209 --> 00:35:43.778
We'll let nature decide.

536
00:35:44.746 --> 00:35:46.279
Oh!

537
00:35:46.581 --> 00:35:48.750
That's quite unusual!

538
00:35:49.117 --> 00:35:51.853
"Let nature decide."

539
00:35:56.724 --> 00:35:57.859
OK.

540
00:36:12.339 --> 00:36:14.207
Oh, Rachel.

541
00:36:14.341 --> 00:36:16.944
Oh, what a superb ovum.

542
00:36:17.078 --> 00:36:19.714
Oh, thanks!

543
00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:23.183
Here we go!

544
00:36:24.786 --> 00:36:27.387
Oh, well, we'd rather a slow
fellow here,

545
00:36:27.522 --> 00:36:29.924
but it's trying,
it's trying...

546
00:36:31.159 --> 00:36:34.227
Well, this one does not suffer
from hyper-motility!

547
00:36:35.897 --> 00:36:37.999
You can do it!
Just a little effort, buddy!

548
00:36:38.132 --> 00:36:40.568
Would you mind not referring
to it as "buddy"?

549
00:36:40.702 --> 00:36:42.503
Here we go. Our little fellow

550
00:36:42.637 --> 00:36:45.573
is in contact with
Rachel's ovum zona pellucida.

551
00:36:45.707 --> 00:36:48.609
It's going to induce changes
in the membrane

552
00:36:48.743 --> 00:36:51.646
and block entry
of other spermatozoa.

553
00:36:54.615 --> 00:36:56.517
They will all die.

554
00:36:57.719 --> 00:37:00.353
The secretion of acrosome
helps the sperm enter

555
00:37:00.487 --> 00:37:01.889
the ovum cytoplasm.

556
00:37:02.023 --> 00:37:04.424
Now the ovum releases
cortisol granules,

557
00:37:04.559 --> 00:37:05.793
which release enzymes

558
00:37:05.927 --> 00:37:08.261
which digest
sperm receptor proteins,

559
00:37:08.395 --> 00:37:09.831
preventing polyspermy.

560
00:37:09.964 --> 00:37:11.899
Oh, here we go!

561
00:37:17.205 --> 00:37:18.773
- Oh!
- Oh!

562
00:37:23.644 --> 00:37:25.312
Oh my God, here we go!

563
00:37:29.984 --> 00:37:32.854
We have a fertilized egg!

564
00:37:32.987 --> 00:37:35.890
- You have a zygote!
- Oh, wow.

565
00:37:36.758 --> 00:37:39.060
- You're gonna be parents!
- Yay!

566
00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.295
Congratulations,
Rachel and Alvy!

567
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.498
You did it!

568
00:38:03.017 --> 00:38:04.619
Your zygote.

569
00:38:06.353 --> 00:38:07.755
Enjoy.

570
00:38:17.698 --> 00:38:20.400
<i>Congratulations!</i>
<i>We're so happy for you!</i>

571
00:38:20.568 --> 00:38:22.270
<i>- This is so exciting!</i>
- Thanks!

572
00:38:22.435 --> 00:38:23.738
- <i>Hi Alvy.</i>
- Hi.

573
00:38:23.905 --> 00:38:25.640
<i>How's the greenery going?</i>

574
00:38:25.773 --> 00:38:27.842
It's going well, thank you.

575
00:38:28.009 --> 00:38:31.078
<i>You should</i>
<i>think about refinancing</i>
<i>that mortgage of yours.</i>

576
00:38:31.245 --> 00:38:32.479
<i>Interest rates are dropping.</i>

577
00:38:32.613 --> 00:38:35.082
Yeah. No, it's fine, Bill.

578
00:38:35.583 --> 00:38:39.120
<i>Yeah, but especially now</i>
<i>that you're having a child.</i>

579
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:41.556
<i>Have you given more thought</i>

580
00:38:41.722 --> 00:38:43.758
<i>about selling</i>
<i>the Shell Island house?</i>

581
00:38:43.891 --> 00:38:46.160
We're not selling the house!

582
00:38:48.062 --> 00:38:50.231
<i>Nobody's going to</i>
<i>the countryside anymore.</i>

583
00:38:50.397 --> 00:38:52.934
<i>- We have access</i> <i>to nature pods.
- </i> - Dad!

584
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.504
<i>I'm just saying, because</i>
<i>the house just sits there.</i>

585
00:38:56.637 --> 00:38:58.405
Yeah, you know what, Dad?

586
00:38:58.539 --> 00:39:00.473
Drop it!

587
00:39:00.908 --> 00:39:04.078
<i>So, do you have the pod</i>
<i>at home? Can I see it?</i>

588
00:39:04.212 --> 00:39:06.814
Oh, um... w-we...

589
00:39:06.948 --> 00:39:09.116
We literally just made
the baby,

590
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.351
so no, we don't have it. Yeah.

591
00:39:11.484 --> 00:39:15.122
We're so excited.
I'm so excited.

592
00:39:51.826 --> 00:39:55.930
What else can we say
about our design so far?

593
00:40:06.841 --> 00:40:09.977
We have of the original
right here

594
00:40:10.678 --> 00:40:13.981
as intended by nature.

595
00:40:16.584 --> 00:40:20.453
Shit!

596
00:40:34.168 --> 00:40:36.671
What is it?

597
00:40:36.804 --> 00:40:39.707
I don't know.
I mean, we just got pregnant.

598
00:40:40.708 --> 00:40:42.109
Look, I just...

599
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:45.445
I just need,
like, a couple weeks.

600
00:40:54.322 --> 00:40:58.159
Alvy,
I'm connected to the pod.
Do you want to listen?

601
00:40:59.727 --> 00:41:01.362
Can you hear anything?

602
00:41:01.494 --> 00:41:03.631
Well, no, but we're connected.

603
00:41:04.031 --> 00:41:08.069
Well,
until the first heartbeat
is audible, there's...

604
00:41:08.202 --> 00:41:10.338
nothing to listen to,
is there?

605
00:41:10.905 --> 00:41:14.075
Yeah, but...
the baby's right here with us.

606
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:17.778
You want to help me
pick a soundtrack?

607
00:41:18.813 --> 00:41:20.848
Isn't that a bit premature?

608
00:41:22.249 --> 00:41:25.686
I'm pretty sure embryos
can feel sound vibrations.

609
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.222
It'll...

610
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:30.691
reach him somehow.

611
00:41:31.158 --> 00:41:32.693
Hm, I doubt it.

612
00:41:33.794 --> 00:41:35.529
Why are you being so negative?

613
00:41:35.663 --> 00:41:37.298
Scientifically,
it's impossible

614
00:41:37.431 --> 00:41:39.700
for an embryo
at this stage of development

615
00:41:39.834 --> 00:41:41.836
to respond to music
or anything else.

616
00:41:41.969 --> 00:41:45.773
I mean, we're talking about
16 blastomere cells here.

617
00:41:48.743 --> 00:41:50.277
You never know.

618
00:42:14.368 --> 00:42:16.170
Um, excuse me, miss?

619
00:42:16.303 --> 00:42:19.273
Would it be possible
to have a peek at my baby?

620
00:42:19.407 --> 00:42:21.742
The screen thingy
is not really working.

621
00:42:21.876 --> 00:42:24.945
Oh, that's actually normal.
It's just too early.

622
00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:27.516
We keep the embryos
in complete darkness

623
00:42:27.648 --> 00:42:31.185
the first 7 weeks,
till the first
audible heartbeat.

624
00:42:31.318 --> 00:42:32.887
Oh...

625
00:42:34.889 --> 00:42:39.660
Now, this baby is ready
to come into this world.

626
00:42:40.127 --> 00:42:42.763
Oh...

627
00:42:44.398 --> 00:42:49.036
When they're ready,
babies release specific
proteins and hormones.

628
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.473
The pod detects
these substances
in the amniotic fluid.

629
00:42:52.606 --> 00:42:54.509
That's how we know
the baby's due.

630
00:42:54.642 --> 00:42:56.677
What about our due date?

631
00:42:56.811 --> 00:42:59.447
It's an indication,

632
00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.983
but in reality,
the baby decides.

633
00:43:04.418 --> 00:43:06.220
Nature knows best.

634
00:43:06.353 --> 00:43:08.322
Oh, yeah...

635
00:43:09.123 --> 00:43:11.292
Let's get this guy delivered.

636
00:43:11.425 --> 00:43:12.893
Hey sweetie!

637
00:43:45.192 --> 00:43:48.629
It's ready!
It's ready! It's ready!

638
00:43:58.239 --> 00:44:00.441
- Wonderful!
- Perfection!

639
00:44:00.575 --> 00:44:02.676
It's flawless.

640
00:44:16.257 --> 00:44:20.427
I have been
having the strangest dreams.

641
00:44:20.562 --> 00:44:23.598
As an example, I dreamt

642
00:44:23.731 --> 00:44:26.967
I give birth to an egg,
but like a...

643
00:44:27.902 --> 00:44:29.670
like a hard boiled egg.

644
00:44:29.837 --> 00:44:31.573
<i>Rachel,</i>

645
00:44:31.739 --> 00:44:33.307
<i>let's remember that dreams</i>

646
00:44:33.474 --> 00:44:35.876
<i>are not</i>
<i>reliable analytical material.</i>

647
00:44:36.043 --> 00:44:38.045
<i>That's so 20th century.</i>

648
00:44:38.179 --> 00:44:42.316
Well, yeah. I know, but...
I-I'd like to understand...

649
00:44:42.449 --> 00:44:44.318
like,
what do you think it means?

650
00:44:44.485 --> 00:44:46.621
<i>We no longer look at dreams</i>

651
00:44:46.787 --> 00:44:49.256
<i>and try to assign them</i>
<i>meaning.</i>

652
00:44:49.456 --> 00:44:51.692
<i>Dreams are arbitrary.</i>

653
00:44:51.825 --> 00:44:53.994
<i>But if pressed,</i>

654
00:44:54.161 --> 00:44:56.864
<i>I'd say that your dream</i>
<i>validates your decision</i>

655
00:44:57.031 --> 00:44:58.732
<i>to choose the Womb Center.</i>

656
00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.803
<i>Everything is under control.</i>
<i>No surprises.</i>

657
00:45:03.304 --> 00:45:05.839
<i>No boiled eggs to worry about.</i>

658
00:45:16.717 --> 00:45:17.851
Whoa!

659
00:45:17.985 --> 00:45:19.386
- There?
- Yeah.

660
00:45:21.789 --> 00:45:23.290
Can you hear it?

661
00:45:23.424 --> 00:45:26.827
Yeah.
Yeah, I can hear it.

662
00:45:26.961 --> 00:45:30.197
Yeah. You're welcome
to take the pod home
for a two week period

663
00:45:30.331 --> 00:45:32.701
after the six months
of gestation.

664
00:45:32.833 --> 00:45:36.403
Most couples prefer to leave
the pod at the center.

665
00:45:37.438 --> 00:45:40.140
Wanna take a sneak peek
at our little fellow?

666
00:45:41.208 --> 00:45:42.476
- Sure.
- You wanna?

667
00:45:42.611 --> 00:45:43.612
I don't mind, do you?

668
00:45:43.744 --> 00:45:45.112
Yeah.

669
00:45:47.248 --> 00:45:48.882
OK.

670
00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:08.996
Alvy, come and see.
I've organized
the baby's room.

671
00:47:13.467 --> 00:47:14.835
Huh!

672
00:47:17.639 --> 00:47:19.641
Well, it's... cream.

673
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.711
It's very... very creamy.

674
00:47:23.745 --> 00:47:25.913
<i>I quite like</i>
<i>the idea of cream.</i>

675
00:47:26.046 --> 00:47:28.415
Thanks, Elena. I like it, too.

676
00:47:29.751 --> 00:47:31.519
Am I allowed to...

677
00:47:31.653 --> 00:47:32.754
to add a touch?

678
00:47:48.837 --> 00:47:50.739
What is it?

679
00:47:51.305 --> 00:47:53.207
- It's an olive tree.
- Huh?

680
00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.175
A birth tree.

681
00:47:56.276 --> 00:48:00.280
And you just...
You want to leave it in here?

682
00:48:01.583 --> 00:48:03.852
- This is a tree.
- Uh-huh.

683
00:48:03.984 --> 00:48:05.452
Human beings, babies included,

684
00:48:05.587 --> 00:48:07.856
are supposed to be
around plants and trees.

685
00:48:08.322 --> 00:48:10.224
You could design
a hologram one.

686
00:48:10.357 --> 00:48:11.760
You know what?

687
00:48:12.426 --> 00:48:14.995
I'm going to plant it
in Shell Island.

688
00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.269
Honey, maybe my dad is right.
Maybe we should sell
Shell Island.

689
00:48:22.403 --> 00:48:24.338
We're not
selling the house, Rachel.

690
00:48:24.471 --> 00:48:27.174
I just don't see the point.
We never go.

691
00:48:27.307 --> 00:48:29.544
The point is
it's our only link to nature.

692
00:48:29.677 --> 00:48:32.580
And we do never go
because you never want
to leave the city!

693
00:48:32.714 --> 00:48:35.550
Because I don't need to drive
three hours and take a ferry

694
00:48:35.683 --> 00:48:38.653
when we have everything here.
We have nature pods.

695
00:48:39.587 --> 00:48:44.491
I won't raise this child
in a... nature pod. Rachel.

696
00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:46.594
I won't.

697
00:49:16.691 --> 00:49:18.225
Hey.

698
00:49:32.072 --> 00:49:34.308
- Did you feel that?
- Oh, yeah.

699
00:49:34.441 --> 00:49:37.044
Yeah.

700
00:49:39.914 --> 00:49:42.182
I'm actually pregnant, too.

701
00:49:42.416 --> 00:49:45.954
You're not showing it all.
How many weeks?

702
00:49:46.086 --> 00:49:50.925
I'm not physically pregnant,
but we're doing the arti...

703
00:49:51.526 --> 00:49:53.962
We are doing the Womb Center.

704
00:49:54.094 --> 00:49:57.331
Oh, the pod. You're so lucky.

705
00:49:57.464 --> 00:50:00.702
We couldn't get a spot.
Maybe for the next one.

706
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:03.838
Oh, my goodness...

707
00:50:04.238 --> 00:50:06.975
Oh!

708
00:50:07.876 --> 00:50:12.412
- Oh... You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

709
00:50:19.419 --> 00:50:21.421
<i>Good evening, Alvy.</i>

710
00:50:22.189 --> 00:50:23.525
Hi.

711
00:50:24.024 --> 00:50:25.593
Rachel's here?

712
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.128
<i>Yes, Alvy.</i>
<i>I believe she's changing.</i>

713
00:50:30.798 --> 00:50:32.534
News, please.

714
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.637
<i>... is an integral part</i>
<i>of our future development.</i>

715
00:50:36.203 --> 00:50:37.672
<i>To travel to Mars,</i>

716
00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:39.741
<i>everyone will need</i>
<i>a Pegazus passport.</i>

717
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.276
<i>Governments</i>
<i>will be in charge of helping</i>

718
00:50:42.442 --> 00:50:46.413
<i>their populations</i>
<i>achieve universal legality.</i>

719
00:50:46.548 --> 00:50:49.416
- <i>We are building...</i>
- What's up?

720
00:50:49.584 --> 00:50:52.085
<i>... that no government</i>
<i>can afford to build.</i>

721
00:50:52.219 --> 00:50:55.590
- Honey?
- Yeah?

722
00:50:55.723 --> 00:50:56.724
Honey?

723
00:50:57.491 --> 00:50:59.794
<i>... is the most important...</i>

724
00:51:03.363 --> 00:51:05.033
What's it doing here?

725
00:51:05.165 --> 00:51:07.569
Well, it's our home period,
honey. I thought it'd be nice

726
00:51:07.702 --> 00:51:10.137
to spend some time
with the pod.

727
00:51:12.907 --> 00:51:14.174
Right.

728
00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:20.414
Should we just...

729
00:51:21.481 --> 00:51:23.283
put it in the bedroom?

730
00:51:25.653 --> 00:51:27.822
Yeah. Uh-huh.

731
00:51:57.451 --> 00:51:59.286
- I'll...
- Yeah...

732
00:51:59.988 --> 00:52:01.589
Sorry, Carol.

733
00:52:24.646 --> 00:52:27.147
I can't do it,
with the pod in here.

734
00:52:30.317 --> 00:52:32.754
What are you talking about?
It can't see us.

735
00:52:34.856 --> 00:52:38.291
- What's going on? Are you OK?
- I don't know, I can't do it.

736
00:52:40.962 --> 00:52:44.197
- Don't shake it.
- No, there's amniotic fluid.

737
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:45.933
The fetus just bounces around.

738
00:53:08.188 --> 00:53:10.692
The baby will fall.

739
00:53:10.825 --> 00:53:12.994
You know?

740
00:53:13.127 --> 00:53:14.729
In the real world,

741
00:53:15.295 --> 00:53:17.565
he or she will...

742
00:53:17.999 --> 00:53:21.435
will fall and it'll be fine.

743
00:53:23.071 --> 00:53:25.540
You don't need to clean it
every time we touch it.

744
00:53:25.673 --> 00:53:28.408
I'm just following
the instructions, Alvy.

745
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:31.913
Isn't the whole thing
hermetically sealed?

746
00:53:32.046 --> 00:53:33.748
It's a porous membrane.

747
00:53:33.881 --> 00:53:36.651
by the way,
the baby can hear us
perfectly right now.

748
00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:43.124
The vegetation wall
really need to trim.

749
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:45.927
Yeah, I'll do it.

750
00:54:02.375 --> 00:54:04.746
- What's going on?
- Thought I...

751
00:54:04.879 --> 00:54:07.014
Maybe it's hungry.
When did you feed it last?

752
00:54:07.148 --> 00:54:09.382
I don't remember.
A couple of hours ago.

753
00:54:09.517 --> 00:54:10.852
You're not sure?

754
00:54:10.985 --> 00:54:12.754
It's in the app.
Am I expected to remember

755
00:54:12.887 --> 00:54:14.822
the exact time
of the last few feeding?

756
00:54:14.956 --> 00:54:16.891
- It's been one day.
- Where's my phone?

757
00:54:17.024 --> 00:54:19.227
You need the phone
to know if it's hungry?

758
00:54:19.359 --> 00:54:20.728
It's in the app!

759
00:54:21.328 --> 00:54:23.131
Are you trying
to make me feel guilty?

760
00:54:23.263 --> 00:54:24.599
You have the app too.

761
00:54:24.732 --> 00:54:26.466
You are welcome
to take over the feeding.

762
00:54:26.601 --> 00:54:28.102
Where are the nutrients?

763
00:54:28.236 --> 00:54:30.337
Look in front of you!

764
00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:48.055
Why do we have to do this?

765
00:54:48.189 --> 00:54:51.259
Well, it's optional,
but work would cover
part of the tuition.

766
00:54:51.391 --> 00:54:55.563
- We don't even have
a child yet.
- I know, but it's New York.

767
00:54:58.298 --> 00:55:02.302
We need to prepare
our children
for the 22nd century.

768
00:55:02.435 --> 00:55:04.806
Singularity is near,

769
00:55:04.939 --> 00:55:07.642
and we don't know what jobs
the future is holding.

770
00:55:07.775 --> 00:55:09.544
Do you follow
a specific curriculum?

771
00:55:09.677 --> 00:55:11.279
All learners move
at their own pace.

772
00:55:11.411 --> 00:55:14.682
We teach coding, but also
concepts and collaboration.

773
00:55:14.816 --> 00:55:17.785
We also introduce them
to fuzzy logic.

774
00:55:18.553 --> 00:55:19.654
Fuzzy logic?

775
00:55:19.787 --> 00:55:22.455
Yeah. Please take your seats.

776
00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:32.399
And this is our art room.

777
00:55:33.301 --> 00:55:34.569
Yes, surprising, isn't it?

778
00:55:35.236 --> 00:55:38.539
No dirty apron, no running
around with scissors

779
00:55:38.673 --> 00:55:40.041
or dripping paint brushes.

780
00:55:40.174 --> 00:55:44.344
Are they just, er...
making digital art?

781
00:55:45.146 --> 00:55:47.748
No, they aren't making
any art at all.

782
00:55:47.882 --> 00:55:50.151
The computers are making
the art,

783
00:55:50.284 --> 00:55:53.486
and the children are giving
the computers their feedback.

784
00:55:54.055 --> 00:55:58.458
The most enduring
misconception
about artificial intelligence

785
00:55:58.593 --> 00:56:01.428
is that it's not creative.
Well, it is!

786
00:56:01.562 --> 00:56:03.331
Much more than us.

787
00:56:03.764 --> 00:56:05.432
Any more questions?

788
00:56:05.867 --> 00:56:08.035
- Yeah.
- Do you have an accreditation

789
00:56:08.169 --> 00:56:09.804
from the Board of Education?

790
00:56:10.004 --> 00:56:12.039
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Where are you from?

791
00:56:12.173 --> 00:56:13.140
- Sweden.

792
00:56:13.274 --> 00:56:15.977
Oh, I see! Well...

793
00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:18.746
Our government is no longer
funding education.

794
00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.049
But we are so lucky
that great companies
like Pegazus

795
00:56:22.183 --> 00:56:25.385
are investing
in our educational system.

796
00:56:25.519 --> 00:56:27.121
It's much more efficient.

797
00:56:28.322 --> 00:56:29.790
- I have a question.
- Yeah?

798
00:56:29.924 --> 00:56:33.227
My nephew, Kormac,
was born at the Womb Center,

799
00:56:33.361 --> 00:56:35.763
but Kormac doesn't dream.

800
00:56:35.897 --> 00:56:38.232
It's a little side effect
we're aware of.

801
00:56:38.366 --> 00:56:41.569
He never had a dream.
I wouldn't worry about it.

802
00:56:41.769 --> 00:56:43.871
Dreaming is not
a primordial function.

803
00:56:44.005 --> 00:56:48.408
Dreams do not serve
any evolutionary purpose.

804
00:56:50.111 --> 00:56:51.646
Any more questions?

805
00:56:53.014 --> 00:56:56.317
In the last three months,
what's impressed me the most

806
00:56:56.449 --> 00:56:57.919
is how social trees are.

807
00:56:58.185 --> 00:57:00.221
In the wilderness,
we can imagine

808
00:57:00.354 --> 00:57:03.423
that they compete and struggle
against each other

809
00:57:03.557 --> 00:57:05.993
for light, for space,

810
00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.396
but they also help
one another.

811
00:57:08.963 --> 00:57:11.933
They seem
very interested in keeping

812
00:57:12.233 --> 00:57:16.637
every member
of their community alive.

813
00:58:50.664 --> 00:58:52.199
Hey...

814
00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:57.772
Hey buddy.

815
00:59:00.341 --> 00:59:02.810
<i>Would you like me</i>

816
00:59:02.977 --> 00:59:04.345

817
00:59:04.478 --> 00:59:07.415
No... No, thanks, Elena.

<i>I am sorry to jump in, Rachel,</i>

820
00:59:16.457 --> 00:59:20.795

<i>this morning is 1342 words,</i>

824
00:59:29.837 --> 00:59:32.706
<i>I am feelings</i>

825
00:59:32.873 --> 00:59:34.742
<i>Is there anything</i>
<i>I could do to help?</i>

826
00:59:34.875 --> 00:59:37.978
No irritation.
Thanks for inquiring.

827
01:00:26.927 --> 01:00:28.896
Whoa!

828
01:00:33.901 --> 01:00:36.003
We did it!

829
01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.107
We did it!

830
01:00:41.008 --> 01:00:42.943
We did it!

831
01:00:44.011 --> 01:00:46.780
<i>Let Us play Yesterday</i>

832
01:00:47.214 --> 01:00:52.653

838
01:01:31.158 --> 01:01:34.361
You recognize
its beauty for the first time.

839
01:01:34.495 --> 01:01:38.098
And you know what?
You also really see it.

840
01:01:43.003 --> 01:01:44.738
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

841
01:01:46.106 --> 01:01:49.977

844
01:01:59.987 --> 01:02:02.089
I want you all to find a tree.

845
01:02:03.023 --> 01:02:04.858
Or a plant.

846
01:02:05.893 --> 01:02:07.261
Go on.

847
01:02:14.501 --> 01:02:16.737
Now, I want you to hug it.

848
01:02:19.641 --> 01:02:21.442
Or just touch it.

849
01:02:23.545 --> 01:02:25.246
Don't be shy.

850
01:02:29.383 --> 01:02:31.051
Close your eyes.

851
01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.955
Inhale.

852
01:02:37.692 --> 01:02:39.193
Exhale.

853
01:02:41.462 --> 01:02:45.499
When we stare at leaves
or touch a tree we can't

854
01:02:46.433 --> 01:02:48.769
mull over thoughts.

855
01:02:50.404 --> 01:02:51.972
We have to let go.

856
01:02:52.806 --> 01:02:56.010
Slowly, our attention circuits
get disconnected.

857
01:02:56.143 --> 01:02:58.513
Our frontal cortex calms down.

858
01:02:58.647 --> 01:03:00.247
Our minds

859
01:03:00.715 --> 01:03:03.117
can wander again

860
01:03:03.652 --> 01:03:05.953
and set itself free.

861
01:03:24.506 --> 01:03:28.175
- Hey Alvy.
Got a second?
- Yeah.

862
01:03:28.942 --> 01:03:30.679
- Oh!
- Yeah.

863
01:03:30.811 --> 01:03:32.547
Congratulations!

864
01:03:33.414 --> 01:03:36.483
I didn't know that you
and Rachel were pregnant!

865
01:03:36.618 --> 01:03:38.886
- Can I?
- Yeah.

866
01:03:39.019 --> 01:03:41.088
- When's it due?
- May.

867
01:03:41.523 --> 01:03:44.325
- Spring baby.
- That's fantastic.

868
01:03:44.659 --> 01:03:47.094
Listen, I just want to chat
with you a bit.

869
01:03:47.227 --> 01:03:48.362
Uh-huh.

870
01:03:50.097 --> 01:03:52.166
Well, we were

871
01:03:52.299 --> 01:03:55.336
looking over the budget
for the biology department.

872
01:03:55.469 --> 01:03:56.738
Mm-hm.

873
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:58.972
And sadly,

874
01:03:59.106 --> 01:04:03.578
the greenhouse maintenance
just seems a bit too...

875
01:04:05.045 --> 01:04:06.380
High.

876
01:04:06.914 --> 01:04:09.149
Yes, unfortunately.

877
01:04:09.818 --> 01:04:11.985
So we were thinking,

878
01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:14.488
of course,
if you'd be up for the idea,

879
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:16.390
that we could...

880
01:04:16.524 --> 01:04:19.594
that we could introduce
holograms.

881
01:04:19.728 --> 01:04:23.531
And then
we could just progressively
phase out the plants

882
01:04:23.665 --> 01:04:24.833
to reduce our cost.

883
01:04:24.965 --> 01:04:27.401
You want to replace my...

884
01:04:28.102 --> 01:04:32.072
my lotus, my taro, loofah,

885
01:04:32.206 --> 01:04:36.176
chamomile, borage,
nigella, my crocuses,

886
01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:39.446
my orchids with holograms?

887
01:04:42.383 --> 01:04:45.953
<i>These penguins</i>
<i>are heading</i>

888
01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.989
<i>to the open water</i>
<i>to the right,</i>

889
01:04:52.527 --> 01:04:54.928
<i>but one of them caught</i>
<i>our eye:</i>

890
01:04:55.095 --> 01:04:56.765
<i>the one in the center.</i>

891
01:04:58.465 --> 01:05:00.167
<i>He would neither go towards</i>

892
01:05:00.334 --> 01:05:02.302
<i>the feeding grounds</i>
<i>at the edge of the ice</i>

893
01:05:02.469 --> 01:05:05.540
<i>nor return to the colony.</i>

894
01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:10.043
<i>With 5000 km ahead of him,</i>

895
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:13.247
<i>he's heading towards</i>
<i>certain deaths.</i>

896
01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:18.753
It's silly, but...

897
01:05:19.186 --> 01:05:22.222
that penguin, it just...

898
01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.630
Should we
bring it back earlier?

899
01:05:30.832 --> 01:05:31.965
Why?

900
01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:36.470
I mean, we're just getting
used to all this.

901
01:05:36.604 --> 01:05:38.405
I don't want you to feel

902
01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.941
like you're stuck at home
with the baby.

903
01:05:41.074 --> 01:05:43.343
No, I don't feel stuck.

904
01:05:44.144 --> 01:05:46.947
I mean, we went
for a walk today. We went...

905
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.550
We went to campus.

906
01:05:48.982 --> 01:05:50.117
You...

907
01:05:50.785 --> 01:05:53.555
- You took the part to work?
- Yeah.

908
01:05:54.722 --> 01:05:57.592
Some of it well stick,
you know.

909
01:06:22.983 --> 01:06:25.285
I just feel like he's...

910
01:06:25.419 --> 01:06:27.287
like he's being reckless.

911
01:06:27.421 --> 01:06:30.859
Like he's acting reckless.

912
01:06:30.991 --> 01:06:32.827
What did he do?

913
01:06:32.961 --> 01:06:34.829
Well, he, like...

914
01:06:34.963 --> 01:06:38.232
- He wears the pod on the front.
-  - Why is that reckless?

915
01:06:38.365 --> 01:06:40.367
Because
most of the dads that I see,

916
01:06:40.501 --> 01:06:43.170
they wear the pods
on the back.

917
01:06:44.438 --> 01:06:46.440
Why does it bother you?

918
01:06:47.474 --> 01:06:51.078
No, it doesn't bother me.
I just don't...

919
01:06:51.546 --> 01:06:52.747
I don't get it.

920
01:06:53.113 --> 01:06:55.950
They're bonding.
You should be happy.

921
01:06:56.183 --> 01:06:57.384
Yeah.

922
01:06:57.819 --> 01:07:00.622
OK, so I know this is
going to sound so weird

923
01:07:00.755 --> 01:07:02.690
because
I'm not technically pregnant,

924
01:07:02.824 --> 01:07:04.759
but I've been having
the weirdest dreams.

925
01:07:04.893 --> 01:07:08.228
- Yeah?
 - Yeah, is that, like, do you...

926
01:07:08.963 --> 01:07:10.430
Y-yes. Yes!

927
01:07:10.565 --> 01:07:13.835
Last week I dreamt that
a snake bit me in the back

928
01:07:13.968 --> 01:07:17.572
and then apologized, saying
the venom could hurt the baby.

929
01:07:19.941 --> 01:07:21.609
Are you exhausted?

930
01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:24.444
Yes.

931
01:07:24.579 --> 01:07:25.445
But...

932
01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.114
once you can get through that,

933
01:07:27.247 --> 01:07:29.316
you can get through anything
in life.

934
01:07:29.817 --> 01:07:31.351
Yeah.

935
01:09:25.133 --> 01:09:28.770
My mother sent us this book
about Attachment Parenting.

936
01:09:29.503 --> 01:09:32.106
Apparently, being
continuously close to a baby

937
01:09:32.239 --> 01:09:34.274
helps them develop empathy

938
01:09:34.408 --> 01:09:36.944
and also benefits the parents.

939
01:09:37.078 --> 01:09:38.646
It's an old theory.

940
01:09:40.313 --> 01:09:44.217
Oh! 1974!

941
01:09:44.786 --> 01:09:47.121
Who knows?
Maybe it's still relevant.

942
01:09:47.989 --> 01:09:50.223
Isn't the whole
Womb Center philosophy

943
01:09:50.357 --> 01:09:52.325
centered
on Detachment Parenting?

944
01:09:52.459 --> 01:09:56.631
Yeah, but it's interesting
to confront philosophies.

945
01:10:04.072 --> 01:10:07.340
I think we should
consult Eliza about all this.

946
01:10:08.275 --> 01:10:10.745
Why?
I'm feeling perfectly fine.

947
01:10:12.146 --> 01:10:13.447
I'm not.

948
01:10:18.186 --> 01:10:21.022
<i>What brings you all</i>
<i>here today?</i>

949
01:10:21.155 --> 01:10:23.323
We're having a hard time

950
01:10:23.457 --> 01:10:26.493
finding our balance
as a family.

951
01:10:26.627 --> 01:10:29.797
Like, everything
seems to be revolving

952
01:10:30.798 --> 01:10:32.332
around the pod.

953
01:10:32.767 --> 01:10:34.001
The baby.

954
01:10:35.937 --> 01:10:37.805
Baby, I'm sorry, I...

955
01:10:37.939 --> 01:10:39.674
I don't see a pod,

956
01:10:39.807 --> 01:10:41.109
I see a baby.

957
01:10:41.642 --> 01:10:45.079
<i>All family members</i>
<i>have to make adjustments</i>

958
01:10:45.245 --> 01:10:47.048
<i>to welcome this new addition.</i>

959
01:10:47.215 --> 01:10:51.119
<i>Your family dynamics are about</i>
<i>to undergo tremendous changes,</i>

960
01:10:51.284 --> 01:10:54.155
<i>and these changes</i>
<i>directly affect you.</i>

961
01:10:54.287 --> 01:10:56.456
Yes. Thanks for that, Eliza.

962
01:10:56.591 --> 01:10:58.258
Yeah. I just feel

963
01:10:58.391 --> 01:11:01.261
as though Alvy is able to bond

964
01:11:01.394 --> 01:11:03.698
with our child,

965
01:11:03.965 --> 01:11:05.066
but I-I'm not.

966
01:11:05.199 --> 01:11:07.668
I just spend more time with

967
01:11:08.301 --> 01:11:10.037
the pod, you know?

968
01:11:10.171 --> 01:11:11.739
It's...

969
01:11:12.173 --> 01:11:14.307
It's as simple as that.

970
01:11:14.942 --> 01:11:16.376
You know?

971
01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:20.047
Maybe that attachment theory
wasn't that crazy after all.

972
01:11:20.181 --> 01:11:23.450
What do you think about
attachment theory, Eliza?

973
01:11:23.618 --> 01:11:25.586
<i>It's obsolete, Alvy.</i>

974
01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.321
As a mother,
I should feel connected.

975
01:11:28.455 --> 01:11:29.891
You're overthinking it.

976
01:11:30.024 --> 01:11:32.026
You're completely
tuned to the pod.

977
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.798
Just give yourself
some time, you know?

978
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:39.567
Honey, maybe it's hormonal.
- Hormonal?

979
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:43.070
What do you mean, hormonal?
Why do you get the hormones?

980
01:11:43.204 --> 01:11:44.605
I'm not saying I have them,

981
01:11:44.739 --> 01:11:47.008
although I did forget
my phone in the fridge.

982
01:11:47.474 --> 01:11:49.677
And... I have been feeling--

983
01:11:49.811 --> 01:11:54.749
Maybe I'm...
I'm just not ready

984
01:11:55.116 --> 01:11:56.717
to be a mother.

985
01:11:57.552 --> 01:12:00.221
No one's a mother
just like that.

986
01:12:00.353 --> 01:12:03.758
You become one.
Isn't that right, Eliza?

987
01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.394
Eliza?

988
01:12:07.795 --> 01:12:11.766
<i>Would you mind connecting me</i>
<i>directly to the pod?</i>

989
01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:15.368
What?

990
01:12:15.536 --> 01:12:17.939
<i>Therapy can start in utero.</i>

991
01:12:18.105 --> 01:12:21.943
<i>You just need to find</i>
<i>the therapy icon on your app.</i>

992
01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.183
It might be a little tight

993
01:12:29.317 --> 01:12:31.484
to pull over.

994
01:12:32.653 --> 01:12:35.422
I mean, that's too tight.

995
01:12:41.863 --> 01:12:44.799
Yup, should be...
There we go. Perfect.

996
01:13:02.283 --> 01:13:04.719
Wood, fire, earth, metal...

997
01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:11.092
We are talking
about true ownership here.

998
01:13:11.225 --> 01:13:13.828
Unstoppable transfers
and Immutable provenance.

999
01:13:13.961 --> 01:13:17.198
- Built-in-randomness
ensures decentralization.

1000
01:13:17.331 --> 01:13:20.167
The nodes are redistributed
across shards in a uniform

1001
01:13:20.301 --> 01:13:21.569
and non-deterministic way.

1002
01:13:28.475 --> 01:13:29.911
- Hey.
- Hey!

1003
01:13:30.044 --> 01:13:31.045
You got a minute?

1004
01:13:31.178 --> 01:13:33.314
Of course, yeah.

1005
01:13:33.446 --> 01:13:36.651
- Um... Rachel.
- Yes.

1006
01:13:37.652 --> 01:13:41.421
I wouldn't bring the pod
here if I were you.

1007
01:13:43.624 --> 01:13:46.027
Um... Why?

1008
01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.628
HR. They don't like it.

1009
01:13:47.762 --> 01:13:49.297
They see it as a distraction.

1010
01:13:49.429 --> 01:13:50.965
Oh my God...

1011
01:13:51.098 --> 01:13:54.434
You don't want to be labeled
"the distracted mom".

1012
01:13:54.568 --> 01:13:56.938
Distracted mom?

1013
01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:00.608
The meeting
this morning was...

1014
01:14:01.509 --> 01:14:03.110
kind of embarrassing.

1015
01:14:03.476 --> 01:14:04.745
Oh, God.

1016
01:14:06.113 --> 01:14:07.548
Can I?

1017
01:14:08.215 --> 01:14:09.517
OK.

1018
01:14:10.785 --> 01:14:12.720
- Come with me.
- OK.

1019
01:14:14.355 --> 01:14:15.923
It's OK.

1020
01:14:20.761 --> 01:14:22.229
Oh.

1021
01:14:25.132 --> 01:14:28.669
- So...
- Is yours in there, too?

1022
01:14:29.637 --> 01:14:32.173
Oh no. We, um...

1023
01:14:33.307 --> 01:14:36.310
We decided to keep ours
at the Womb Center
until birth.

1024
01:14:36.444 --> 01:14:41.048
It just became too stressful
to have the pod at home.

1025
01:14:42.183 --> 01:14:43.551
OK.

1026
01:15:09.243 --> 01:15:10.544
Shit.

1027
01:15:10.711 --> 01:15:12.246
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

1028
01:15:23.657 --> 01:15:25.126
Good night!

1029
01:15:32.266 --> 01:15:35.503
This workshop is all about
your personal experiences

1030
01:15:35.636 --> 01:15:37.171
and journeys with your pods.

1031
01:15:37.304 --> 01:15:40.541
You're in a safe space
to share any

1032
01:15:41.175 --> 01:15:44.812
emotional or logistical issues
you're facing

1033
01:15:44.945 --> 01:15:46.080
during your pregnancies.

1034
01:15:46.213 --> 01:15:47.848
- Everything OK?
- Yes. Sorry.

1035
01:15:47.982 --> 01:15:50.051
It was just
a crazy day at work.

1036
01:15:51.685 --> 01:15:55.289
After the meeting greet,
you're invited
to drop your pods

1037
01:15:55.423 --> 01:15:56.991
in the incubation room.

1038
01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:24.118
Maybe...

1039
01:16:25.186 --> 01:16:26.887
we should ask
for an extension.

1040
01:16:27.021 --> 01:16:29.223
They don't offer extensions,
Alvy.

1041
01:16:29.356 --> 01:16:31.225
Why are they so rigid?

1042
01:16:32.359 --> 01:16:34.428
We're in a bonding phase.

1043
01:16:34.563 --> 01:16:37.698
I know,
but we can still visit.

1044
01:17:25.179 --> 01:17:27.882
I just don't understand
this rule.

1045
01:17:30.885 --> 01:17:33.821
I guess
it was in the fine print.

1046
01:20:14.248 --> 01:20:16.183
Rachel? Sorry, sorry.

1047
01:20:16.317 --> 01:20:18.085
- Do you have a second?
- Yeah.

1048
01:20:18.218 --> 01:20:20.321
- Please.
- Sure.

1049
01:20:22.056 --> 01:20:24.559
Thanks.
I just want us to touch base.

1050
01:20:24.693 --> 01:20:27.127
- Mm-hm.
- Is everything all right?

1051
01:20:27.529 --> 01:20:30.197
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1052
01:20:30.331 --> 01:20:31.398
Yeah, why?

1053
01:20:31.533 --> 01:20:33.735
Well, the algorithm,

1054
01:20:33.867 --> 01:20:36.571
it noticed a change
in productivity.

1055
01:20:37.137 --> 01:20:40.207
Uh-huh, well I've... I mean...

1056
01:20:40.341 --> 01:20:44.011
Maybe I've been
a bit distracted lately.

1057
01:20:44.144 --> 01:20:45.412
Feeling depressed?

1058
01:20:45.547 --> 01:20:47.682
Depressed? No.

1059
01:20:47.816 --> 01:20:49.283
No? OK, low-key, you know

1060
01:20:49.416 --> 01:20:52.787
like nothing's wrong,
but... nothing's right?

1061
01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.589
No. Why?

1062
01:20:54.723 --> 01:20:57.792
You have a baby in gestation
at the Womb Center, right?

1063
01:20:57.925 --> 01:20:58.959
Mm-hm.

1064
01:20:59.426 --> 01:21:02.731
- All good on that front?
- Yeah.

1065
01:21:02.863 --> 01:21:06.266
It has been
a wonderful experience.

1066
01:21:12.973 --> 01:21:14.809
Oh, your baby's thriving!

1067
01:21:16.343 --> 01:21:19.046
What can I say?
It all looks perfect.

1068
01:21:19.179 --> 01:21:21.448
Just a few more days to go.

1069
01:21:21.915 --> 01:21:24.952
Now, is next

1070
01:21:25.085 --> 01:21:27.522
Wednesday a good delivery day?

1071
01:21:27.955 --> 01:21:29.490
Delivery day?

1072
01:21:29.923 --> 01:21:32.059
We have our due date,
don't we?

1073
01:21:32.192 --> 01:21:34.361
Mm... We recently changed
our policy.

1074
01:21:34.495 --> 01:21:36.798
We now induce
at 39 weeks at full term.

1075
01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:40.434
Some of the babies weren't
releasing their birth hormone.

1076
01:21:40.568 --> 01:21:43.738
They just linger in their pods
for a few more weeks.

1077
01:21:43.872 --> 01:21:47.675
We can't afford that!
Our pods are in such demand.

1078
01:21:47.809 --> 01:21:51.011
So here is the consent form

1079
01:21:51.145 --> 01:21:53.947
for your birth
inducing package.

1080
01:21:55.784 --> 01:21:57.418
Er... what is it?

1081
01:21:57.552 --> 01:21:59.119
Oh, it's oxytocin.

1082
01:21:59.687 --> 01:22:02.423
It's the love hormone.
It's all natural.

1083
01:22:03.825 --> 01:22:07.494
There was one other thing
we'd like to discuss with you.

1084
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:09.930
We wanted
to take the pod back with us

1085
01:22:10.063 --> 01:22:11.699
and then bring it to you

1086
01:22:11.833 --> 01:22:13.100
for the birth.

1087
01:22:13.233 --> 01:22:16.103
Oh, I'm sorry,
that's not possible.

1088
01:22:16.236 --> 01:22:19.273
Our Neuro-Enhancement
Workshop starts today.

1089
01:22:19.406 --> 01:22:21.576
But you're welcome
for parental visits.

1090
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:23.711
Neuro-Enhancement Workshop?

1091
01:22:23.845 --> 01:22:26.980
A wonderful workshop.
You don't want
your baby to miss out.

1092
01:22:28.683 --> 01:22:30.752
I don't remember
signing up for that.

1093
01:22:30.885 --> 01:22:33.387
Well,
it's all in your contract.

1094
01:22:33.521 --> 01:22:35.924
The data we collect
is precious for science, too.

1095
01:22:36.056 --> 01:22:38.693
It helps
our blue brain research.

1096
01:22:38.827 --> 01:22:40.027
Blue brain research?

1097
01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.395
Now, if you don't mind,

1098
01:22:41.529 --> 01:22:44.431
let's focus
on some postpartum tips.

1099
01:22:44.566 --> 01:22:48.435
Now, the most difficult aspect
of taking care of a newborn

1100
01:22:48.570 --> 01:22:50.839
is it's undoubtedly
the sleep issue.

1101
01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:52.272
But...

1102
01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:55.442
We came up with a solution.

1103
01:22:56.945 --> 01:22:58.613
There you go.

1104
01:22:58.813 --> 01:23:00.380
And one for you.

1105
01:23:07.087 --> 01:23:08.355
What is it?

1106
01:23:08.489 --> 01:23:10.290
It's a dream pod, or a D-pod.

1107
01:23:10.424 --> 01:23:13.193
It's very soothing
for newborns.

1108
01:23:13.628 --> 01:23:16.898
We just launched it.
Parents are raving about it.

1109
01:23:17.297 --> 01:23:19.066
What kind of dreams?

1110
01:23:19.199 --> 01:23:21.870
Oh, it's a really
very simple dream content.

1111
01:23:22.002 --> 01:23:26.006
It's funny dreams.
Friendly, short,
simple dreams, you know.

1112
01:23:27.007 --> 01:23:31.345
The content will be upgraded
as the technology improves.

1113
01:23:32.814 --> 01:23:35.517
No pods!
Leave our wombs alone!

1114
01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:37.519
No pods!
Leave our wombs alone!

1115
01:23:39.253 --> 01:23:41.523
I thought radical feminists
were pro-pod.

1116
01:23:41.656 --> 01:23:44.926
Not these radical feminists.

1117
01:23:45.058 --> 01:23:47.094
You know what,

1118
01:23:47.227 --> 01:23:49.429
j-just wait here for me, OK?

1119
01:23:49.564 --> 01:23:51.633
- Yeah?
- Yeah, wait here.

1120
01:23:52.065 --> 01:23:53.668
All right.

1121
01:23:53.801 --> 01:23:56.604
No pods!
Leave our wombs alone!

1122
01:23:56.738 --> 01:23:59.774
37 weeks is premature
but it's not uncommon.

1123
01:23:59.908 --> 01:24:02.209
Do you remember
the time of the first blink?

1124
01:24:04.044 --> 01:24:05.547
around 8 AM?

1125
01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.481
Some babies are in a rush.

1126
01:24:07.615 --> 01:24:09.884
Let me get a delivery room
ready for you.

1127
01:24:10.018 --> 01:24:11.151
Thank you!

1128
01:24:11.553 --> 01:24:13.721
Hi, sir.
I'll be right with you.

1129
01:24:40.615 --> 01:24:43.383
It's my pod.

1130
01:25:00.068 --> 01:25:01.736
Do you mind
if I grab these?

1131
01:25:01.869 --> 01:25:03.738
I guess you don't need them
now, right?

1132
01:25:03.871 --> 01:25:07.809
Congratulations.
So exciting, isn't it?

1133
01:25:08.141 --> 01:25:10.110
Good luck.

1134
01:25:12.914 --> 01:25:16.383
No pods!
Leave our wombs alone!

1135
01:25:59.326 --> 01:26:01.228
We have a 2-for-1 promotion
today.

1136
01:26:01.361 --> 01:26:03.064
Don't want
to grab another baby?

1137
01:26:03.196 --> 01:26:05.332
Oh, no. I'm fine, thanks.

1138
01:26:05.465 --> 01:26:08.502
We also have a promotion
on funny dreams.

1139
01:26:08.636 --> 01:26:11.539
- No, thanks.
- Are you a fine member?

1140
01:26:11.673 --> 01:26:14.509
- No.
- What a cutie.

1141
01:27:04.959 --> 01:27:06.527
Alvy.

1142
01:27:06.994 --> 01:27:09.564
Alvy. Honey, wake up.

1143
01:27:09.697 --> 01:27:10.898
Wake up.

1144
01:27:17.471 --> 01:27:20.307
Jeez, the Womb Center
is relentless.

1145
01:27:20.742 --> 01:27:23.711
Honey,
let's go to Shell Island.

1146
01:27:24.812 --> 01:27:27.749
- What?
- Yeah, let's pack and go.

1147
01:27:28.216 --> 01:27:29.217
What's going on?

1148
01:27:29.349 --> 01:27:32.220
Let's have our baby there.

1149
01:27:32.352 --> 01:27:34.021
What are you talking about?

1150
01:27:34.922 --> 01:27:37.692
Let's have our baby in nature,

1151
01:27:37.825 --> 01:27:39.994
just like you always wanted.

1152
01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:42.897
Hold on.
What's going on, Rachel?

1153
01:27:43.931 --> 01:27:47.334
I cannot have
our child's first experience
be the Womb Center.

1154
01:27:47.467 --> 01:27:49.336
- OK.
- Yeah?

1155
01:27:49.771 --> 01:27:52.140
- OK, I'm not going to argue with that!
-  - OK!

1156
01:27:52.272 --> 01:27:55.743
- What about Wozcek?
We should--
- Let's tell them...

1157
01:27:56.443 --> 01:27:58.513
we're having a home birth.

1158
01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:59.814
Yes.

1159
01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.849
Tell them that.

1160
01:28:07.287 --> 01:28:12.126
My wife's i-in a...
bonding phase with the baby.

1161
01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:13.795
We'd like to...

1162
01:28:13.928 --> 01:28:16.130
We'd like to keep the pod
until birth.

1163
01:28:16.264 --> 01:28:19.000
Mr. Novy,
we discussed this yesterday.

1164
01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:22.369
I'm sorry, it's not possible.

1165
01:28:22.502 --> 01:28:24.672
The pod should never have left
the center.

1166
01:28:24.806 --> 01:28:28.509
But there's a baby
in the pod, right? Our baby.

1167
01:28:28.643 --> 01:28:31.646
We have...
we have jurisdiction

1168
01:28:31.779 --> 01:28:33.413
on this this human being.

1169
01:28:33.548 --> 01:28:35.016
Yes,

1170
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:37.218
the baby is yours,
but the pod is the property

1171
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:38.986
of the Womb Center.

1172
01:28:39.954 --> 01:28:42.389
Bring the pod back here
safe and sound

1173
01:28:42.523 --> 01:28:44.258
at your earliest convenience.

1174
01:28:44.391 --> 01:28:46.561
Look,
what if I was to tell you

1175
01:28:46.694 --> 01:28:49.630
that we are... considering

1176
01:28:50.397 --> 01:28:52.033
having a home birth?

1177
01:28:52.767 --> 01:28:54.802
I'm sorry.

1178
01:28:55.368 --> 01:28:56.904
A home birth?

1179
01:28:58.506 --> 01:29:00.473
Why on earth
would you want to do that?

1180
01:29:00.608 --> 01:29:02.143
Well, um...

1181
01:29:02.276 --> 01:29:05.412
Some pregnant couples
decide to have home births.

1182
01:29:05.546 --> 01:29:09.482
It's perfectly safe and legal,
so...

1183
01:29:09.617 --> 01:29:11.018
You know?

1184
01:29:11.152 --> 01:29:13.120
We could hire
one of your nurses.

1185
01:29:13.254 --> 01:29:15.623
Oh, you don't need
one of our nurses.

1186
01:29:15.756 --> 01:29:19.060
All you need is
the self-generated birth code.

1187
01:29:19.193 --> 01:29:20.561
You see, the problem is,

1188
01:29:20.695 --> 01:29:24.031
your baby is currently being
hosted in a womb

1189
01:29:24.165 --> 01:29:27.400
that does not belong to you
nor your wife.

1190
01:29:28.236 --> 01:29:30.004
Now, we have a long wait list.

1191
01:29:30.437 --> 01:29:34.075
We don't want to risk
any damages to these pods
at birth, so please,

1192
01:29:34.842 --> 01:29:37.444
let's get back to our senses.

1193
01:30:46.881 --> 01:30:49.050
- Are you OK, honey?
- Yeah.

1194
01:31:52.713 --> 01:31:55.483
Oh, that's Usnea lichen.

1195
01:31:55.616 --> 01:31:58.185
They attract
ruby-throated hummingbirds

1196
01:31:58.319 --> 01:32:00.855
who use them
to camouflage their nest.

1197
01:32:01.389 --> 01:32:04.792
I mean, lichens are
surprisingly fascinating.

1198
01:32:04.925 --> 01:32:07.695
They're one of the earliest
life forms on Earth.

1199
01:32:08.829 --> 01:32:12.266
Most people think
they're a type of moss.

1200
01:32:12.666 --> 01:32:15.669
They're
their own kind of being,

1201
01:32:15.803 --> 01:32:18.205
neither plant nor animal.

1202
01:32:18.339 --> 01:32:19.974
Well, so what are they?

1203
01:32:20.641 --> 01:32:23.778
- They're the perfect marriage.
-  - Yeah.

1204
01:32:23.911 --> 01:32:25.813
- Between fungus and algae.

1205
01:32:25.946 --> 01:32:27.481
- Yeah, OK.

1206
01:32:40.294 --> 01:32:43.230
The whole forest is like a web

1207
01:32:43.364 --> 01:32:45.766
of constantly evolving
relationships.

1208
01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.202
Everything is entwined
and overlapping.

1209
01:32:48.335 --> 01:32:50.971
They look like
they're talking to each other.

1210
01:32:51.105 --> 01:32:54.108
Yeah, well,
they do talk to each other...

1211
01:32:56.811 --> 01:32:59.847
To them, it's more important

1212
01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:04.652
to cooperate than to compete.
It's a synergistic system.

1213
01:34:08.048 --> 01:34:10.217
It's not so bad, is it?

1214
01:34:10.351 --> 01:34:12.686
Mm...
I could get used to it.

1215
01:34:14.889 --> 01:34:18.859
There's just
so much silence here.

1216
01:34:41.215 --> 01:34:42.449
Alvy.

1217
01:34:43.751 --> 01:34:45.319
Honey.

1218
01:35:31.031 --> 01:35:33.602
- Alvy?
- Yeah?

1219
01:35:33.734 --> 01:35:36.470
Er, it's not turning on.

1220
01:35:36.605 --> 01:35:38.305
What's not turning on?

1221
01:35:38.439 --> 01:35:39.473
The base.

1222
01:35:40.675 --> 01:35:42.843
Could it be the fuse?

1223
01:35:43.477 --> 01:35:45.614
No, the lights are on.

1224
01:35:45.846 --> 01:35:47.114
Well...

1225
01:35:48.449 --> 01:35:50.150
I left it on...

1226
01:35:55.222 --> 01:35:57.291
- These motherfuckers.
- What?

1227
01:35:57.424 --> 01:35:59.694
They've disconnected it
remotely.

1228
01:36:00.194 --> 01:36:02.062
Then we need to go back!

1229
01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:04.265
Let's not panic.

1230
01:36:04.398 --> 01:36:07.034
No-no, we need to call them
right now.

1231
01:36:07.167 --> 01:36:10.137
No, I will not give into
this obscene blackmail.

1232
01:36:10.271 --> 01:36:12.741
This is about the baby!
This isn't about us.

1233
01:36:12.873 --> 01:36:14.743
What's the pod's autonomy?

1234
01:36:14.875 --> 01:36:17.077
Forty-eight hours, I think.

1235
01:36:17.211 --> 01:36:20.080
Forty-eight hours?
Well, that's...

1236
01:36:20.214 --> 01:36:22.584
That's enough. I mean...

1237
01:36:22.717 --> 01:36:24.985
The baby is due
any minute now.

1238
01:36:26.487 --> 01:36:30.057
- We need to take it easy.
- Are you out of your mind?

1239
01:36:30.725 --> 01:36:32.126
No.

1240
01:36:34.428 --> 01:36:35.896
Rachel.

1241
01:36:37.599 --> 01:36:39.033
Rachel.

1242
01:36:42.169 --> 01:36:44.305
We need to trust this.

1243
01:36:45.707 --> 01:36:47.041
OK?

1244
01:36:49.410 --> 01:36:50.944
OK.

1245
01:36:52.813 --> 01:36:54.214
OK.

1246
01:37:11.231 --> 01:37:13.967
Er...

1247
01:37:22.577 --> 01:37:25.780
Um... OK...

1248
01:37:25.913 --> 01:37:28.482
Um, we...

1249
01:37:28.616 --> 01:37:29.983
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

1250
01:37:34.789 --> 01:37:38.760
OK, so the app
is asking for a birth code.

1251
01:37:38.892 --> 01:37:41.428
Er... Our due date.
Let me try that.

1252
01:37:42.630 --> 01:37:44.365
No, it's not that.

1253
01:37:44.498 --> 01:37:46.668
- Maybe it's, er...
the conception date.

1254
01:37:46.801 --> 01:37:48.502
- OK... What is it?

1255
01:37:51.639 --> 01:37:53.240
- Maybe I...

1256
01:37:53.608 --> 01:37:55.242
What are we going to do?

1257
01:37:56.511 --> 01:37:59.480
- I'm going
to have to break it open.
- No! No!

1258
01:37:59.614 --> 01:38:01.181
It really, um...

1259
01:38:02.483 --> 01:38:06.053
That seems really extreme
a reaction to Oh, no...

1260
01:38:06.186 --> 01:38:08.389
Alvy, honey... Oh God.

1261
01:38:08.523 --> 01:38:10.991
OK. Oh my God!

1262
01:38:15.129 --> 01:38:17.532
- Maybe this one...
- Oh my God, is it OK?

1263
01:38:17.665 --> 01:38:20.568
OK... All right.

1264
01:38:22.804 --> 01:38:24.238
Let me try that.

1265
01:38:24.371 --> 01:38:25.973
Oh God!

1266
01:38:26.106 --> 01:38:28.075
- Alvy, be careful!
- OK!

1267
01:38:31.111 --> 01:38:32.547
It's coming!

1268
01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.682
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1269
01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:38.553
Our baby.

1270
01:38:44.091 --> 01:38:45.860
You got it!

1271
01:38:51.633 --> 01:38:53.367
Alvy!

1272
01:39:21.796 --> 01:39:24.198
It's incredible.

1273
01:39:34.776 --> 01:39:36.511
You're perfect.

1274
01:40:56.156 --> 01:40:57.525
Hi.

1275
01:41:02.129 --> 01:41:03.631
Standard or priority?

1276
01:41:03.765 --> 01:41:05.265
Standard.

1277
01:43:35.049 --> 01:43:38.418
We've always been
a customer obsessed company.

1278
01:43:39.787 --> 01:43:42.857
And guess who is the customer
at the Womb Center?

1279
01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:44.926
I have to say the parents.

1280
01:43:45.059 --> 01:43:46.293
No.

1281
01:43:46.794 --> 01:43:47.862
The baby.

1282
01:43:47.995 --> 01:43:50.198
This is all about the babies!

1283
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:54.367
Tell me, then,
how do you envision
the future for our children?

1284
01:43:57.138 --> 01:43:59.473
Hopefully, one day

1285
01:43:59.707 --> 01:44:03.010
children will get
to choose their parents.

1286
01:44:04.112 --> 01:44:09.117
And my advice to them will be
"choose your parents wisely".
