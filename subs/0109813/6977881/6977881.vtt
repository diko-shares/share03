Fred, before you go... (GRUNTS)

Would you mind chipping your "X"
on a couple of these?

Yeah, sure. What are they?

852
00:52:04.625 --> 00:52:07.211
Well, you sign these
and your buddies down in the quarry

853

854
00:52:09.254 --> 00:52:13.675

all those memos I been sendin' in.

who's to thank for this.

858
00:52:26.563 --> 00:52:30.192
(GRUNTS) Mr. Flintstone,
up to now our relationship

859
00:52:30.234 --> 00:52:33.028
has not been based on mutuality
of admiration or respect.

860
00:52:33.111 --> 00:52:34.196
Huh?

861
00:52:34.238 --> 00:52:37.574
Put simply, you hate my bird guts
and I think you're dumber than mud.

862
00:52:37.658 --> 00:52:41.745
-Ah. Well, good night.
-Still, I wish to pass on an old dictum...

that may be apropos here.

you're the office equipment.

No, thank you, Fred.
I'll wait till Barney gets here.

I'm not sure what time he gets done.

Fred, did you hear what happened
to everyone at the quarry today?

917
00:55:52.227 --> 00:55:55.814
Yup. A few hours ago,
I sent them all off on a nice, long vacation.

918
00:55:56.064 --> 00:55:59.026
You mean, a permanent vacation.

Who are you going to believe,
me or some busboy?

923

That busboy is
your best friend!

00:56:11.747 --> 00:56:15.751
Best friend? I lost my best friend
the day I became an executive!

925
00:56:15.792 --> 00:56:18.504
He's just jealous
of my hard-earned success.

926
00:56:18.587 --> 00:56:22.466
Hard-earned? Tell me something,
Mr. Vice President,

927
00:56:22.674 --> 00:56:25.302
what's a graduated
inventory plan, huh?

928
00:56:25.385 --> 00:56:27.387
How about supply and demand?

Hey, Fred!
What's two and two?

930
00:56:31.475 --> 00:56:35.646
I didn't come here to talk business.
I'm out with my wife.

931
00:56:35.812 --> 00:56:38.065
Now,
get me a clean spoon.

932
00:56:38.565 --> 00:56:39.858
That does it!

933
00:56:40.817 --> 00:56:45.572
The only reason you got that job
is 'cause I switched tests with you.

934
00:56:45.739 --> 00:56:49.660
-Oh, Barney.
-Oh-ho-ho, that's rich!

935
00:56:49.826 --> 00:56:54.748
What good would it do me to switch tests
with the guy that got the lowest score?

936
00:56:54.915 --> 00:56:59.962
-Think about it, Fred.
-Oh, finally it all makes sense.

937
00:57:00.128 --> 00:57:02.256
You don't believe this, do you?

938
00:57:02.422 --> 00:57:04.675
Are you calling my husband a liar?

939
00:57:04.842 --> 00:57:06.677
This has gone far enough.

We took you into our home.

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:46.920
Let's ride with the family down the street

1343
01:24:47.087 --> 01:24:50.382
Through the courtesy
of Fred's two feet

1344
01:24:50.549 --> 01:24:53.051
When you're with the Flintstones

1345
01:24:53.218 --> 01:24:57.347
Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
A dabba-doo time

1346
01:24:57.514 --> 01:25:00.851
We'll have a gay old time

1347
01:25:08.025 --> 01:25:11.153
(DINO BARKING)

1348
01:25:40.933 --> 01:25:43.894
MAN: The Flintstones!

1349
01:25:45.354 --> 01:25:48.106
Flintstones
Meet the Flintstones

1350
01:25:48.273 --> 01:25:52.069
They're the modern
Stone Age family

1351
01:25:52.236 --> 01:25:54.821
From the
town of Bedrock

1352
01:25:54.988 --> 01:25:58.909
They're a page
right out of history

1353
01:25:59.076 --> 01:26:02.454
Someday maybe
Fred will win the fight

1354
01:26:02.621 --> 01:26:05.749
Then that cat will
stay out for the night

1355
01:26:05.916 --> 01:26:08.460
When you're
with the Flintstones

1356
01:26:08.627 --> 01:26:12.756
Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
A dabba-doo time

1357
01:26:12.923 --> 01:26:16.343
We'll have a gay old time

1358
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:28.438
We'll have a gay old time

1359
01:26:31.066 --> 01:26:33.110
Yeah!

1360
01:26:37.531 --> 01:26:39.032
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1361
01:26:39.199 --> 01:26:41.827
I was travelin' to Earth
and what did I spot

1362
01:26:41.994 --> 01:26:44.329
A little village by the water
Sign said Bedrock

1363
01:26:44.496 --> 01:26:46.999
I met this kid named Fred
He didn't wear no socks

1364
01:26:47.165 --> 01:26:49.668
He had a part-time gig
at the Gravel Pit slingin' rocks

1365
01:26:49.835 --> 01:26:52.796
Said he was into hip hop
Could he kick a spell I told him go for it

1366
01:26:52.963 --> 01:26:55.632
But at first said what you think
I said you're style is prehistoric

1367
01:26:55.799 --> 01:26:58.677
Sounds stuck in the Stone Age
You're still using a hammer and chisel

1368
01:26:58.844 --> 01:27:00.637
Carving out your lyrics
on stone pages

1369
01:27:00.804 --> 01:27:03.974
It's about time you heard a style from a real
before-the-wheel rapper

1370
01:27:04.141 --> 01:27:06.560
Set it off and he said yabba-dabba-doo

1371
01:27:06.727 --> 01:27:08.854
Then he got to prove
The fella's suddenly standing

1372
01:27:09.021 --> 01:27:10.856
In the middle of a crowd of K drummers

1373
01:27:11.023 --> 01:27:13.275
Sayin' tell us how you flipped
the script and ripped

1374
01:27:13.442 --> 01:27:16.445
I get busy one time They said yeah
yeah I'm hip, I'm hip

1375
01:27:16.612 --> 01:27:18.447
Didn't know the time
Didn't know about fly

1376
01:27:18.614 --> 01:27:22.159
So I, you know, I had to show
a Cave Man how to rock

1377
01:27:24.995 --> 01:27:27.664
In the Stone Age

1378
01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:29.833
I showed a Cave Man
how to rock

1379
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.337
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1380
01:27:35.839 --> 01:27:38.342
In the Stone Age

1381
01:27:38.509 --> 01:27:40.469
I showed a Cave Man
how to rock

1382
01:27:40.636 --> 01:27:43.680
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1383
01:27:50.312 --> 01:27:54.024
Barney Rubble
Fred Flintstone

1384
01:27:57.528 --> 01:28:00.864
Hey, Freddie boy
Don't try to get too close

1385
01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:04.785
I don't want to catch
a man with those

1386
01:28:07.329 --> 01:28:10.332
We'll meet at
the Bedrock disco

1387
01:28:10.374 --> 01:28:13.544
Who cares that I got T. Rex

1388
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:15.879
On my radio

1389
01:28:16.630 --> 01:28:22.177
On this prehistoric day
I feel duty-bound to say

1390
01:28:22.594 --> 01:28:27.140
Before I reach
my destination

1391
01:28:27.307 --> 01:28:32.646
On this prehistoric day
I feel duty-bound to say

1392
01:28:32.813 --> 01:28:37.484
I owes an explanation

1393
01:28:37.651 --> 01:28:40.779
Give me one good reason

1394
01:28:42.656 --> 01:28:46.118
Give me two good reasons

1395
01:28:47.744 --> 01:28:50.914
Give me three good reasons

1396
01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:55.377
Why's men do what they do

1397
01:28:58.547 --> 01:29:02.301
Yabba-dabba-doo Yabba-dabba-doo
Yabba-dabba-doo

1398
01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.850
Anarchy in Bedrock

1399
01:29:10.017 --> 01:29:13.478
Stop in some time
and meet Betty and Wilma

1400
01:29:13.645 --> 01:29:16.940
Try some Flint upside-down
Rubble bubble cake

1401
01:29:17.107 --> 01:29:19.985
Or just try
Fruity Pebbles

1402
01:29:20.152 --> 01:29:22.946
'Cause I

1403
01:29:23.113 --> 01:29:26.241
Wanna be

1404
01:29:26.408 --> 01:29:28.827
Fred Flintstone

1405
01:29:30.829 --> 01:29:34.124
Is this the U.S.D.A.

1406
01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:37.586
Is this Hollywood

1407
01:29:37.753 --> 01:29:40.839
Is this Bedrock

1408
01:29:41.006 --> 01:29:44.301
I thought it was Hollyrock

1409
01:29:44.468 --> 01:29:46.803
'Cause I

1410
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:50.349
Wanna be

1411
01:29:50.516 --> 01:29:52.935
Fred Flintstone

1412
01:29:55.437 --> 01:29:59.024
Yabba-dabba-doo

1413
01:30:04.988 --> 01:30:07.574
