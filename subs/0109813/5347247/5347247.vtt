Come on,
you lazy Cro-Magnon!

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.524
Ohh!

3
00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:48.393
Hey! Back to work!
You guys had a break two days ago!

4
00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:50.395
Come on, now!

5
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.987
Come on, Sheba!

6
00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:59.093
That's my big girl!

7
00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.203
Look at those
pathetic worms...

8
00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:08.033
burrowing
their lives away.

9
00:01:08.137 --> 00:01:11.278
Do you know why I'm up here and
they're down there, Miss Stone?

10
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:13.763
Because you lied
on your résumé?

11
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.834
No.

12
00:01:15.937 --> 00:01:18.319
Because
I have vision.

13
00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:21.357
And right now I have a
vision of you and me...

14
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.981
dripping with coconut oil
on a beach in Rocapulco...

15
00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.295
with Mr. Slate's fortune
to keep us company.

16
00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:34.508
I'm glad we see
eye to eye.

17
00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:41.929
And somewhere down there
is the ignorant stooge...

18
00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:45.519
who will make
all my schemes come true.

I'm just so excited, Fred.
I'm gonna be a father.

48
00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:12.528
It's like
a dream come true.

49
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:16.394
A son. Someone to carry on
the proud name of Rubble.

50
00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:18.396
Think I'll be
a good daddy, Fred?

51
00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.467
Well, you're bound to find
something you're good at.

52
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.573
Yeah, sure... Hey!

53
00:04:26.196 --> 00:04:29.441
Uncle!

54
00:04:29.545 --> 00:04:32.341
You know, Fred, Betty and I
really owe it all to you.

55
00:04:32.444 --> 00:04:35.861
We would've never qualified to adopt had
it not been for the money you gave us.

56
00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:38.208
Now, remember, Barn,
that's between you and me.

57
00:04:38.312 --> 00:04:41.108
Well, gee, Fred, I'd like to be
able to tell the whole world...

58
00:04:41.211 --> 00:04:43.835
what a great guy
my best buddy is! No, no, no, no.

59
00:04:43.938 --> 00:04:47.563
True, it was a selfless, noble
act, if I do say so myself,

60
00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:50.048
but my only reward
will be your happiness.

61
00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:53.154
I don't need to go blabbin'
my good deeds all around.

62
00:04:53.258 --> 00:04:55.743
You're afraid to
tell Wilma, aren't you?

63
00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:03.130
Afraid? Now,
let's get this straight, Rubble.

64
00:05:03.233 --> 00:05:06.444
I don't need permission from
my wife to make a decision.

65
00:05:06.547 --> 00:05:09.792
In my cave,
I reign supreme!

66
00:05:09.895 --> 00:05:12.139
Su-preme!

67
00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:15.107
I won't tell her,
Fred. Thanks, pal.

68
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:51.454
Hiya, Timmy!

69
00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:54.146
Here you go!
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

70
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.667
Hey, Charlie!

71
00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:16.099
Huh?

72
00:06:16.203 --> 00:06:19.758
Wilma, I'm home!

73
00:06:22.623 --> 00:06:25.315
No, Dino! No, no!
No, Dino! Bad boy!

74
00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.559
Oh!

75
00:06:27.663 --> 00:06:30.804
Bad dog!

76
00:06:30.907 --> 00:06:33.289
- Good doggy!
- Bad Dino breath.

77
00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.291
Fred!

78
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.432
Do you have to get Dino so
wound up when you come home?

79
00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:41.953
It's not my fault. Maybe he'd
calm down if we had him fixed!

80
00:06:42.056 --> 00:06:45.025
What?

81
00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:51.549
Here comes
the big Daddysaurus!

82
00:06:57.865 --> 00:07:00.558
How was your day, dear?

83
00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:03.215
I think my brontocrane's
pregnant again.

84
00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:05.563
I tell ya,

85
00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:08.773
you forget to lock her up
oneSaturday night...

86
00:07:08.876 --> 00:07:12.259
- Comfortable, Fred?
- On my way.

87
00:07:12.362 --> 00:07:16.366
All I need's a brew and a good scratch.
Which one you want to do first?

88
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.300
Oh, it does my heart good
to see you relaxing...

89
00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:21.406
after a hard day
at the quarry.

90
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.445
I'm telling you, I married the pick
of the litter. -

91
00:07:25.548 --> 00:07:29.552
Fred, our garbage disposal has
been acting up a lot lately,

92
00:07:29.656 --> 00:07:33.176
so I decided that it was
time to buy a new one.

93
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.939
But when I went to take money
out of our savings account,

94
00:07:37.042 --> 00:07:40.183
guess what. New garbage disposal?

95
00:07:40.287 --> 00:07:44.878
New garbage disposal?
Why throw good money down the drain?

96
00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:47.363
There's nothing wrong
with this one.

97
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.745
All right, you.
Say "ahh."

98
00:07:49.848 --> 00:07:51.919
Uh-uh.

99
00:07:56.268 --> 00:07:59.548
Do you have any idea why there's
no money in our savings account?

100
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:01.481
Aha!

101
00:08:03.655 --> 00:08:06.555
There's your problem
right there.

102
00:08:11.836 --> 00:08:15.149
All right, you!
Spit it out!

103
00:08:15.253 --> 00:08:17.048
Where's the money,
Fred?

104
00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:21.017
Something happened to it.
There, I said it.

105
00:08:21.121 --> 00:08:24.055
We have scrimped and saved
for that money.

106
00:08:24.158 --> 00:08:26.644
And every time weget
a little bit ahead,

107
00:08:26.747 --> 00:08:29.336
youhave to go blow it on
some harebrained scheme!

108
00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:33.478
Now, see here, Wilma!
In this cave, Iam the king!

109
00:08:33.582 --> 00:08:36.067
And... And what, Fred?

110
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.795
And you have every right
to know, my queen.

111
00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:42.901
I gave it to Barney.

112
00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:46.146
You what? I know I should've
consulted you,

113
00:08:46.249 --> 00:08:48.666
but Barney Rubble's my
neighbor, my lodge brother...

114
00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:51.669
and my best friend since the first
time I went through the fifth grade.

115
00:08:51.772 --> 00:08:53.567
Fred Flintstone!

116
00:08:53.671 --> 00:08:56.915
Wilma, without that money, they
wouldn't be allowed to adopt a baby.

117
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.919
So go ahead, yell, scream,
let the fur fly.

118
00:09:01.023 --> 00:09:03.543
Give the neighbors
something to talk about!

119
00:09:08.168 --> 00:09:11.136
What you have just done
for the Rubbles...

120
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.486
is the sweetest,
most generous thing I ever heard.

121
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.282
And I adore you for it.

122
00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:25.392
Mmm.

123
00:09:25.495 --> 00:09:27.636
I also bought
a new bowling ball.

124
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.955
Wait!
Come on, honey!

125
00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:39.268
Watch your step. Sit down.

126
00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:43.375
All right,
all together, folks.

127
00:09:52.695 --> 00:09:54.904
Betty, sit down
and relax.

128
00:09:55.008 --> 00:09:57.562
Oh, I can't, Wilma.
It just hit me.

129
00:09:57.666 --> 00:10:00.496
From now on,
I'll be spending 24 hours a day...

130
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.293
attending to the every need
of a helpless little boy.

131
00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:11.334
Then again, maybe it won't be
such a big adjustment after all.

132
00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:17.444
Fred!

133
00:10:17.547 --> 00:10:21.621
And promise me you won't say anything like
you did when you saw my sister's baby.

134
00:10:21.724 --> 00:10:25.832
The kid had a tail. What was I supposed
to do? Pretend I didn't notice?

135
00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:30.077
Hello, Mommy and Daddy!
I have someone who wants to meet you.

136
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.984
Well, it's not exactly
what we pictured, but...

137
00:10:40.087 --> 00:10:43.608
we'll love him
like he was our own. No, no, no.

138
00:10:43.712 --> 00:10:47.232
This little fellow
belongs to the Hendersons.

139
00:10:54.067 --> 00:10:56.932
- So glad you'll be nursing.
- Congratulations.

140
00:10:57.035 --> 00:11:01.799
Mr. And Mrs. Rubble,
this is your little boy.

141
00:11:03.766 --> 00:11:06.113
Oh, Barney, isn't he precious?

142
00:11:06.217 --> 00:11:09.151
Precious? They'd have been
better off with the monkey. Fred!

143
00:11:09.254 --> 00:11:11.360
- Does he have a name?
- Bamm-Bamm.

144
00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:15.433
- Is that short for somethin'?
- Bamm-Bamm-Bamm.

145
00:11:17.055 --> 00:11:19.989
You're going to have to take it
slowly with this one.

146
00:11:20.093 --> 00:11:24.476
He doesn't speak yet, and he's
a little skittish around humans.

147
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.964
But then again, I guess I would be too
if I had been raised by wild mastodons.

148
00:11:29.067 --> 00:11:31.518
- Mastodons?

149
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:34.107
Let's not nitpick.
A mammal's a mammal.

150
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.974
Well, sounds to me like all
he needs is a little lovin'.

151
00:11:39.077 --> 00:11:40.907
Ohh.

152
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.392
Come here, little guy.

153
00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:46.395
He growled. Yeah. That's cute.

00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:03.575
♪ M-A-N, Caveman ♪Whoa!

169
00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:05.577
What an arm!

170
00:13:09.029 --> 00:13:12.515
"And Cinderocka married
the handsome prince, and...

171
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.527
and they lived
happily ever after."

172
00:13:30.913 --> 00:13:32.984
Come on. Hurry.

173
00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:53.211
Yeah!

174
00:13:57.077 --> 00:13:59.977
Okay, Brother Flintstone,
we need a strike to win.

175
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.013
Can you do it?

176
00:14:02.117 --> 00:14:04.119
Is the Earth flat?

177
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.436
- Come on, Freddie!
- Come on, hit it!

178
00:14:16.717 --> 00:14:18.305
Come on, twinkle toes.

179
00:14:32.526 --> 00:14:34.390
Fred!

180
00:14:34.494 --> 00:14:37.946
Waka-waka-woo!
Waka-waka-woo!

181
00:14:38.049 --> 00:14:41.121
- Wooga-wooga-wee!
- Wooga-wooga-wee!

182
00:14:41.225 --> 00:14:44.021
Piki-piki-piki!
Poki-poki-poki!

183
00:14:44.124 --> 00:14:46.782
Ahhhhhhhh-oooh!

184
00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.991
Lava juice!

185
00:14:49.095 --> 00:14:51.960
Hey, can I have everybody's
attention, please?

186
00:14:52.063 --> 00:14:54.617
I would like to
propose a toast...

187
00:14:54.721 --> 00:14:59.105
to not only a great bowler,
but a great human being.

188
00:15:00.244 --> 00:15:03.350
And no offense to you guys.

189
00:15:03.454 --> 00:15:08.286
"Since I was just a lad of 10,
I've had the very bestest friend.

190
00:15:09.356 --> 00:15:11.911
He may be big,
he may be loud,

191
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.363
so you'll never
lose him in a crowd.

192
00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:19.090
But for my friend
the special part...

193
00:15:19.194 --> 00:15:22.576
is what's behind his ribs...
his heart.

194
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.202
- I owe my son to
him, and now...

195
00:15:27.305 --> 00:15:30.930
I stand before my peers
and vow...

196
00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:35.003
I'll pay him back,
someday, somehow."

197
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.698
The end.

198
00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:52.813
That was beautiful, Barn. I meant every word
of it, Fred.

199
00:15:52.917 --> 00:15:55.264
Care to join me
in a cold one? Love to.

200
00:16:02.409 --> 00:16:04.998
It doesn't get
any better than this.

201
00:16:43.933 --> 00:16:45.763
Ohh!

202
00:16:46.833 --> 00:16:48.628
Oh!

203
00:16:54.565 --> 00:16:56.498
Look at him.

204
00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:58.914
Drunk as a skunkosaurus.

205
00:17:01.192 --> 00:17:04.471
Mother, I can handle this. Fred.

206
00:17:04.575 --> 00:17:07.819
What's that old fossil doing here?
The tar pits back up again?

207
00:17:07.923 --> 00:17:12.514
Well, somebody has to be here looking
after my daughter and grandchild...

208
00:17:12.617 --> 00:17:15.689
while you're out carousing
with a bunch of Neanderthals.

209
00:17:15.793 --> 00:17:18.175
Oh, really?
Well, for your information,

210
00:17:18.278 --> 00:17:20.798
the lodge no longer
accepts Neanderthals.

211
00:17:20.901 --> 00:17:24.595
He robs your nest egg to bail out
that little troll next door...

212
00:17:24.698 --> 00:17:28.875
while my daughter has to wash
her clothes in the river.

213
00:17:28.978 --> 00:17:32.292
I got half a mind... Oh, don't
flatter yourself.

214
00:17:32.396 --> 00:17:34.674
That's it!
Where's my club, Wilma?

215
00:17:34.777 --> 00:17:36.986
You just try it,
fatso!

216
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.059
Boy, if you was a man,
I'd knock you... Enough! Mother! Fred!

217
00:17:40.162 --> 00:17:43.338
You two should be
ashamed of yourselves!

218
00:17:43.441 --> 00:17:46.410
I've got my hands full
just being ashamed of him.

219
00:17:46.513 --> 00:17:49.516
You got your hands full when you scratch
your neck! - Now stop it!

220
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.277
Both of you!

221
00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.004
Mother, Fred is a loving
husband and a good provider.

222
00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:59.871
Oh, really? What has he ever
provided you besides shade?

223
00:17:59.975 --> 00:18:02.495
Oh, Wilma,

224
00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:05.153
you could've married
Elliot Firestone,

225
00:18:05.256 --> 00:18:07.327
the man who invented
the wheel.

226
00:18:07.431 --> 00:18:09.950
Instead you picked
Fred Flintstone,

227
00:18:10.054 --> 00:18:12.505
the man who invented
the excuse.

228
00:18:12.608 --> 00:18:16.302
Let me tell you something, Pearl...
I'm not gonna be a nobody all my life.

229
00:18:16.405 --> 00:18:20.064
One of these days, I'm gonna be
a somebody... a real somebody!

230
00:18:20.168 --> 00:18:23.481
Then we'll live in the lap of luxury, and
Wilma will have everything she deserves.

231
00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:26.415
And when that day comes,
you're gonna be so busy eatin' crow...

232
00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:29.763
you'll be passing feathers
for a month!

233
00:18:29.867 --> 00:18:33.560
Oh, you poor, poor dear.

234
00:18:33.664 --> 00:18:38.186
And when I think of all the
sacrifices your father made for you.

235
00:18:38.289 --> 00:18:40.912
Lambs, oxen,

236
00:18:41.016 --> 00:18:43.536
your brother Jerry.

237
00:18:43.639 --> 00:18:45.883
Well... Oh, Wilma.

238
00:18:45.986 --> 00:18:48.334
Do your mother
a favor.

239
00:18:48.437 --> 00:18:50.784
Just call
Elliot Firestone.

240
00:18:50.888 --> 00:18:53.097
Even if things
don't work out,

241
00:18:53.201 --> 00:18:56.273
he can give you a great
deal on some tires.

242
00:18:56.376 --> 00:18:59.241
Yes, Mother.Byesie-bye.

243
00:18:59.345 --> 00:19:01.899
I'll show her.
I'll show everybody.

244
00:19:02.002 --> 00:19:04.108
I know you will,
Fred.

245
00:19:04.212 --> 00:19:07.318
Call me fatso. Let's
get some sleep.

246
00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:30.893
Hey,
what's the special?

247
00:19:41.076 --> 00:19:42.905
This job sucks.

248
00:19:46.495 --> 00:19:49.015
What you got today? Lizard and onions.
Want half?

249
00:19:49.118 --> 00:19:51.190
Sure.

250
00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:58.127
You know, Fred, I hear that eatin'
too much red meat is bad for you.

251
00:19:58.231 --> 00:20:00.199
What a load of bunk.

252
00:20:00.302 --> 00:20:04.375
My father ate it every day of his life.
He lived to the ripe old age of 38.

253
00:20:04.479 --> 00:20:06.826
Your attention, please.
May I have your attention?

254
00:20:06.929 --> 00:20:09.415
I have a very important
announcement to make.

255
00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:12.141
Did you find out why the guys
in Pit 6 are losing their hair?

256
00:20:12.245 --> 00:20:18.217
Yes. And we are currently in the process of
refuting the results of that investigation.

257
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.496
But today I am here to formally
announce the creation...

258
00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:24.809
of Slate and Company's
executive placement program.

259
00:20:24.913 --> 00:20:27.571
Hold your questions, please.

260
00:20:27.674 --> 00:20:31.126
That's right. This Saturday,
an aptitude test will be given,

261
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.680
granting one of you
the opportunity...

262
00:20:33.784 --> 00:20:36.131
to crawl out
of the primordial ooze...

263
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:38.409
and be somebody!

264
00:20:38.513 --> 00:20:40.653
A vice president
at Slate and Company,

265
00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:45.313
with an obscene salary
anda shiny nameplate.

266
00:20:45.416 --> 00:20:47.453
Ooh.

267
00:20:47.556 --> 00:20:50.525
Good luck, and may
the best biped win.

268
00:20:52.975 --> 00:20:56.496
An executive?
This is my chance to be somebody.

269
00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.567
Be somebody.

270
00:20:59.775 --> 00:21:01.294
Whee!

271
00:21:03.607 --> 00:21:06.782
Higher, Bamm-Bamm,
higher!

272
00:21:06.886 --> 00:21:09.958
Higher!
Higher!

273
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.029
Whee!

274
00:21:12.132 --> 00:21:13.582
Wilma. Hmm?

275
00:21:13.686 --> 00:21:15.964
How did you get rid of
the ring around the collar?

276
00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:17.759
I just started
washing Fred's neck.

277
00:21:17.862 --> 00:21:21.487
Hmm. You know, Wilma, if Fred
scores the highest on that test,

278
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.386
you'll be able to hire someone
to do your laundry for you.

279
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:29.080
If Fred scores the highest on that test,
I'll have to hire someone to revive me.

280
00:21:31.566 --> 00:21:34.154
Oh, it's true.
Fred's no Albert Einstone.

281
00:21:34.258 --> 00:21:36.295
But you never know.
He may surprise you. Whee!

282
00:21:36.398 --> 00:21:38.435
Well, maybe.

283
00:21:38.538 --> 00:21:40.885
He has been studying
day and night. Whee!

284
00:21:40.989 --> 00:21:46.201
Oh, I know. I've never seen him so excited about
something you couldn't spread mayonnaise on.

285
00:21:51.896 --> 00:21:54.382
You know, Barn, I've been
thinking about this executive job.

286
00:21:54.485 --> 00:21:56.453
It's not me.

287
00:21:56.556 --> 00:21:59.456
Cooped up inside
some swank office all day,

288
00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:01.389
kissing
the big shot's feet.

289
00:22:01.492 --> 00:22:03.391
Not Fred Flintstone.

290
00:22:03.494 --> 00:22:05.496
Why, good afternoon,
Mr. Vandercave.

291
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.259
My, that's a handsome pelt
you're wearing today. Thank you.

292
00:22:10.363 --> 00:22:13.193
Your attention, please!
Please take your seats.

293
00:22:13.297 --> 00:22:15.817
And... welcome.

294
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.716
You will have one hour
to complete the exam.

295
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.720
Please. Carve all answers with
a well-sharpened No. 2 chisel.

296
00:22:24.653 --> 00:22:26.586
On behalf
of Slate and Company,

297
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.694
I want to wish you all
the very best of luck.

298
00:22:32.454 --> 00:22:35.008
Let's begin.

299
00:23:21.089 --> 00:23:23.194
Ohh.

300
00:23:24.506 --> 00:23:26.715
Chisels down.

301
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.308
Please slide
your answer slab...

302
00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:35.517
into the numbered envelope
provided...

303
00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:38.762
and stack them neatly
on my desk.

304
00:23:38.865 --> 00:23:41.972
Psst! Hey, Fred!
How'd you do?

305
00:23:42.075 --> 00:23:44.940
How'd I do?
How'd I do?

306
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.881
Hey, you want me to
take that up for you? Yeah. Thanks, pal.

307
00:24:05.202 --> 00:24:08.516
"And I stand before
my peers and vow,

308
00:24:08.619 --> 00:24:12.796
I'll pay him back,
someday, somehow."

309
00:24:35.059 --> 00:24:38.131
Well, Cliff,
the test results are in.

310
00:24:38.235 --> 00:24:40.099
And our
unsuspecting dupe is?

311
00:24:40.202 --> 00:24:43.930
Believe it or not, the one who scored
the highest was Fred Flintstone.

312
00:24:44.034 --> 00:24:47.313
That big ape? No, the big ape
got a 65.

313
00:24:47.416 --> 00:24:49.695
Flintstone?
No, this can't be right.

314
00:24:49.798 --> 00:24:52.214
He must have cheated.
He's dense, he's witless...

315
00:24:52.318 --> 00:24:54.803
He's perfect.

316
00:24:54.907 --> 00:24:57.634
The results of the exam
were very competitive,

317
00:24:57.737 --> 00:25:00.429
and just because an
applicant was not selected...

318
00:25:00.533 --> 00:25:02.984
is no indication
of lack of ability.

319
00:25:03.087 --> 00:25:06.539
I am pleased to announce... I know a kiss-off when
I hear one. Let's go, Barn.

320
00:25:06.643 --> 00:25:08.679
That the newest member
of our executive rank...

321
00:25:08.783 --> 00:25:11.130
is Mr. Fred Flintstone!

322
00:25:11.233 --> 00:25:14.720
- Huh?
- Barney, quick. What's my name?

323
00:25:14.823 --> 00:25:16.860
Fred Flintstone! Don't toy with me,
Barney.

324
00:25:16.963 --> 00:25:19.207
You did it, Fred!
You made it!

325
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.623
Yabba-dabba-dabba-doo!

326
00:26:10.914 --> 00:26:14.538
Good morning,
Mr. Vice President.

327
00:26:14.642 --> 00:26:17.092
Good morning,
Mrs. Vice President.

328
00:26:20.371 --> 00:26:24.134
Oh, Dino!
Oh, Dino, no!

329
00:26:25.722 --> 00:26:27.965
Aaah!

330
00:26:28.069 --> 00:26:30.140
Hey! Mmm!

331
00:26:30.243 --> 00:26:32.142
Attababy!

332
00:26:37.216 --> 00:26:40.840
Ohh.

333
00:26:45.051 --> 00:26:47.191
Good boy, Dino.

334
00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:10.421
Well, how do I look?

335
00:27:10.525 --> 00:27:13.390
Daddy pretty.

336
00:27:13.493 --> 00:27:15.357
It's perfect.

337
00:27:15.461 --> 00:27:17.946
Yeah. Snazzy.

338
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:22.123
So, Fred, what am I gonna call you
now, huh? Boss? Chief?

339
00:27:22.226 --> 00:27:24.677
No, a simple
"Your Highness" will do.

340
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:27.404
No, Barn,

341
00:27:27.507 --> 00:27:31.546
I'm not gonna be one of these guys that makes
it and then forgets where he came from.

342
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:36.551
First thing I'm gonna do is get everyone
in the quarry some vacation time.

343
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.795
And maybe a health plan
with free foot care.

344
00:27:38.898 --> 00:27:42.074
Gee, Fred. I'd settle for them little
packets of ketchup for the lunchroom.

345
00:27:42.177 --> 00:27:45.284
I'm only one man. Not from the back.

346
00:27:45.387 --> 00:27:47.286
Hey, hey.

347
00:27:49.806 --> 00:27:53.913
Well, I guess this is it,
Mr. Flintstone.

348
00:27:59.885 --> 00:28:01.887
Go get 'em, big guy.

349
00:28:04.924 --> 00:28:07.686
- Hey, Barn.
- Yeah, Fred?

350
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:10.965
Could you spot me a couple bucks
for lunch? I'm a little short.

351
00:28:13.001 --> 00:28:15.003
You're right, Fred.

352
00:28:16.384 --> 00:28:18.386
Nothing's changed.

353
00:28:38.682 --> 00:28:41.961
Welcome aboard,
Flintstone!

354
00:28:42.065 --> 00:28:45.309
We're glad you're here.
Nice suit!

355
00:28:45.413 --> 00:28:48.071
You know, Fred,
any gravel brain...

356
00:28:48.174 --> 00:28:51.557
can shovel rock down in the
quarry, but up here...

357
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.699
Do you know what we do up here? Well, me and the guys have
always wondered.

358
00:28:55.803 --> 00:28:58.219
We interface, Flintstone.

359
00:28:58.322 --> 00:29:01.291
We strategize, analyze,

360
00:29:01.394 --> 00:29:03.465
conceptualize,
prioritize.

361
00:29:03.569 --> 00:29:05.571
When do we eat?

362
00:29:05.674 --> 00:29:10.472
Fred, until this moment I wasn't
sure we'd picked the right man.

363
00:29:10.576 --> 00:29:12.440
Now I'm certain.

364
00:29:20.448 --> 00:29:22.346
Fred Flintstone,

365
00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.452
you've arrived.

366
00:29:26.695 --> 00:29:28.939
This is my office? That's right.

367
00:29:29.043 --> 00:29:31.562
This is my chair? Mm-hmm.

368
00:29:31.666 --> 00:29:35.497
Not to throw too much at you on your first
day, but this big thing here is your desk.

369
00:29:35.601 --> 00:29:38.466
My desk? Watch out for your fingers
in the drawers.

370
00:29:41.987 --> 00:29:44.368
Am I interrupting?

371
00:29:44.472 --> 00:29:48.096
Not at all. Fred, I'd like you
to meet your new secretary,

372
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.134
Miss Sharon Stone. Mysecretary?

373
00:29:51.237 --> 00:29:53.999
Personalsecretary,
Mr. Flintstone.

374
00:29:54.102 --> 00:29:57.312
That is, of course,
if you want me.

375
00:30:00.488 --> 00:30:02.870
Great.

376
00:30:02.973 --> 00:30:06.356
Well, I'm sure the two
of you would like to get...

377
00:30:06.459 --> 00:30:08.289
better acquainted.

378
00:30:12.741 --> 00:30:14.916
Mr. Flintstone,
I'd like you to know...

379
00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.678
that I enjoy working
long hours, late nights,

380
00:30:18.782 --> 00:30:20.646
even weekends.

381
00:30:20.749 --> 00:30:24.029
So feel free
to use me...

382
00:30:24.132 --> 00:30:26.894
however you see fit.

383
00:30:27.929 --> 00:30:30.207
Now, can I get you
anything?

384
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:32.485
Coffee?
Sure.

385
00:30:34.867 --> 00:30:38.975
How would you like it? In a cup?

386
00:30:39.078 --> 00:30:41.046
Bold choice,
Mr. Flintstone!

387
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:43.082
You'll go far
in this company.

388
00:30:55.405 --> 00:30:59.547
Take a memo.
Cliff, let's play golf.

389
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:03.723
We can prioritize, conceptualize
and, uh... tenderize.

390
00:31:03.827 --> 00:31:06.865
Executively yours,
Fred Fli... Aaaaah!

391
00:31:08.073 --> 00:31:11.283
Are there six or seven
I's in "Fli... Aaah"?

392
00:31:11.386 --> 00:31:14.976
- Who said that?
- It was I, your dictabird.

393
00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.014
- Dicta-what?
- Dictabird. Read my beak.

394
00:31:18.117 --> 00:31:20.223
"Cliff, let's play golf.

395
00:31:20.326 --> 00:31:24.641
We can prioritize,
conceptualize and, uh, tenderize."

396
00:31:24.744 --> 00:31:28.231
Wow. Wow!

397
00:31:28.334 --> 00:31:31.682
Mr. Flintstone, I'd like to warn
you that management positions...

398
00:31:31.786 --> 00:31:33.615
are fraught with peril.

399
00:31:33.719 --> 00:31:36.101
And, whenever you find
yourself in a befuddled state,

400
00:31:36.204 --> 00:31:37.965
I urge you
to avail yourself...

401
00:31:38.068 --> 00:31:40.760
of my experience
and sage advice.

402
00:31:40.864 --> 00:31:42.728
Oh, really?

403
00:31:42.831 --> 00:31:45.696
- Listen, birdie, let's get the
pecking order straight here. - Hmm.

404
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.700
I don't need any help from you.
I'm Vice President of...

405
00:31:49.804 --> 00:31:51.668
Of, uh...

406
00:31:54.533 --> 00:31:57.156
Industrial Procurement.

407
00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.918
How about that?
Excuse me.

408
00:32:02.782 --> 00:32:05.647
Hey, guys!

409
00:32:05.751 --> 00:32:07.822
Guess what I am!

410
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:11.515
Vice President of
Industrial Procurement!

411
00:32:15.726 --> 00:32:18.660
Oy! Whew.

412
00:32:18.764 --> 00:32:21.008
Yeah.

413
00:32:22.147 --> 00:32:25.805
There. I'm all done
with the requisition forms.

414
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:28.532
What do you think?

415
00:32:28.636 --> 00:32:31.294
It's perfect.

416
00:32:31.397 --> 00:32:33.503
Looks just like
the real one.

417
00:32:33.606 --> 00:32:38.335
Mr. Flintstone, you are about to
embezzle a great deal of money.

418
00:32:38.439 --> 00:32:41.925
Unfortunately, for you,
we get to keep it.

419
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:44.824
Wecan have Flintstone
sign these right away.

420
00:32:44.928 --> 00:32:46.965
Not just yet.

421
00:32:47.068 --> 00:32:50.796
Creatures like this Flintstone are...
primitive,

422
00:32:50.899 --> 00:32:53.626
prone to irrational
bouts of integrity.

423
00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:59.184
We've got to make absolutely
certain he'll do whatever we say.

424
00:33:02.428 --> 00:33:05.431
Fred is the greatest bowler
on Earth.

425
00:33:05.535 --> 00:33:08.572
"Fred is the greatest bowler
on Earth." -

426
00:33:08.676 --> 00:33:12.300
Okay, now you talk, and see how
much I can remember. -

427
00:33:12.404 --> 00:33:15.131
Workin' hard?

428
00:33:16.718 --> 00:33:21.137
Okay, Fred, are you ready for
your first executive action?

429
00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.829
Ready and willing.
Whatever you need, consider it done!

430
00:33:23.932 --> 00:33:26.073
Good. I want you
to fire Bernard Rubble.

431
00:33:26.176 --> 00:33:28.868
Done... What?
Fire Barney? Why?

432
00:33:28.972 --> 00:33:32.665
Well, for starters, he scored the
lowest on the management aptitude test.

433
00:33:32.769 --> 00:33:36.566
He's an imbecile. The company can't afford
to have dead weight like him on the payroll.

434
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:40.777
But, Mr. Vandercave,
he's got a new kid, a mortgage.

435
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.607
I'm his best friend.
I can't.

436
00:33:43.711 --> 00:33:47.025
Fred,
if you don't fire him,

437
00:33:47.128 --> 00:33:49.061
I will.

438
00:33:49.165 --> 00:33:51.167
And then I'll fire you.

439
00:34:04.111 --> 00:34:08.287
Come on, Fred. Usually you're yakkin' my ear
off, but today you haven't said two words.

440
00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:10.910
Something exciting
must have happened up there.

441
00:34:11.014 --> 00:34:15.398
You don't want to know,
Barn, believe me. Sure I do, Fred.

442
00:34:15.501 --> 00:34:18.194
You're the first one of us
to make it out of that quarry.

443
00:34:18.297 --> 00:34:20.230
Look at me. Huh.

444
00:34:20.334 --> 00:34:22.646
I'll probably be working there
for the rest of my life.

445
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:24.579
No, you won't, Barn.

446
00:34:24.683 --> 00:34:27.168
Take my word for it.

447
00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:33.140
Come on and take a look at it. It's a dish in
the shower, you keep the soap right in it.

448
00:34:33.243 --> 00:34:36.557
Listen, Barney. There's
something we gotta talk about. Yeah, yeah. Later, Fred.

449
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.593
Surprise!

450
00:34:38.697 --> 00:34:42.321
Way to go, Fred!

451
00:34:54.575 --> 00:34:56.749
Wilma,
you shouldn't have. Hmm?

452
00:34:56.853 --> 00:35:01.720
I didn't. This was all
Barney and Betty's idea.

453
00:35:01.823 --> 00:35:05.448
Aren't we lucky to have
friends like them, Fred?

454
00:35:05.551 --> 00:35:07.553
Ohh!

455
00:35:07.657 --> 00:35:09.831
There he is!

456
00:35:09.935 --> 00:35:14.526
There's my big, handsome son-in-law!

457
00:35:15.872 --> 00:35:17.770
Have you lost weight?

458
00:35:17.874 --> 00:35:19.841
Have we met?

459
00:35:21.188 --> 00:35:23.638
Can I have everybody's
attention, please?

460
00:35:23.742 --> 00:35:25.813
I got a little something
I'd like to say.

461
00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:29.713
I hope it's not another poem.

462
00:35:29.817 --> 00:35:33.545
Fred, Betty,
Bamm-Bamm and I could not be happier,

463
00:35:33.648 --> 00:35:37.238
- even if it was me that got that job.
- Aw!

464
00:35:37.342 --> 00:35:41.553
So we got you a little something just
to show you how proud of you we are.

465
00:35:41.656 --> 00:35:44.625
Congratulations, big guy!

466
00:35:47.145 --> 00:35:49.112
Barney,
I can't accept this.

467
00:35:49.216 --> 00:35:51.183
Sure, you can. No, I can't.
Take it back.

468
00:35:51.287 --> 00:35:54.462
We can't, Fred. We had
your initials branded on it. It's yours, Fred.

469
00:35:54.566 --> 00:35:57.638
- No, it's not!
- Fred, what's wrong with you?

470
00:35:57.741 --> 00:36:01.193
It's a lovely gift, and he is
thrilled to receive it.

471
00:36:01.297 --> 00:36:03.091
Aren't you, Fred? No!

472
00:36:03.195 --> 00:36:05.887
- Don't you like the color? - It's
not the briefcase, it's not the color.

473
00:36:05.991 --> 00:36:08.683
- I just can't take anything from you.
- But, Fred...

474
00:36:08.787 --> 00:36:10.823
Take a hike, shorty.

475
00:36:10.927 --> 00:36:14.896
My Freddie doesn't want
that tacky thing.

476
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.176
- How come, Fred?
- Because you can't afford it, Barn.

477
00:36:18.279 --> 00:36:20.178
Ohh.

478
00:36:20.281 --> 00:36:22.490
Sure I can, pal.

479
00:36:22.594 --> 00:36:25.286
Not anymore.

480
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:27.254
- You're fired. -
- Fired?

481
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:36.608
Well!

482
00:36:36.711 --> 00:36:40.853
Let's not let a little thing
like this spoil the party.

483
00:36:40.957 --> 00:36:43.408
Conga line!

484
00:36:43.511 --> 00:36:47.584
Conga! Conga!

485
00:36:53.625 --> 00:36:55.696
Don't worry about me,
Fred.

486
00:36:55.799 --> 00:36:59.113
I've been working in that quarry
since it was only eight feet deep.

487
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:03.290
- Attaboy! - There could be a
whole new world opening up for me.

488
00:37:03.393 --> 00:37:06.948
Maybe I'll take in that
franchise show this weekend. That's the spirit.

489
00:37:07.052 --> 00:37:09.157
Thanks.

490
00:37:09.261 --> 00:37:11.401
Hey, Fred. There's just
one thing I gotta know.

491
00:37:11.505 --> 00:37:14.508
After all these years,
how come they're canning me?

492
00:37:15.785 --> 00:37:17.821
Barn,

493
00:37:17.925 --> 00:37:19.961
you're
a wonderful father,

494
00:37:20.065 --> 00:37:21.963
a loving husband,

495
00:37:22.067 --> 00:37:23.896
a hard worker...

496
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.934
and one heck of
a little bowler.

497
00:37:27.037 --> 00:37:31.766
But, Barn, none of that
counts on an aptitude test.

498
00:37:33.423 --> 00:37:35.908
You got the lowest score,
pal.

499
00:37:37.841 --> 00:37:39.705
The lowest score?

500
00:38:01.071 --> 00:38:05.283
Wilma, that is beautiful!

501
00:38:05.386 --> 00:38:08.251
You can't catch me! Well, I have
always wanted...

502
00:38:08.355 --> 00:38:11.081
a Halstone original.
Mmm.

503
00:38:12.497 --> 00:38:15.845
Ohh! Now, Wilma,
don't be silly.

504
00:38:15.948 --> 00:38:18.399
Your husband's a big executive.
You can afford it.

505
00:38:18.503 --> 00:38:20.919
Charge it!

506
00:38:26.027 --> 00:38:28.892
Bamm-Bamm!

507
00:38:28.996 --> 00:38:32.240
Ohh! Bamm-Bamm!

508
00:38:32.344 --> 00:38:34.864
- No!
- Bamm-Bamm! Bamm-Bamm!

509
00:38:47.566 --> 00:38:51.190
Gentlemen, please.
I cannot endorse this modernization...

510
00:38:51.294 --> 00:38:53.469
if it means laying off
all those workers.

511
00:38:53.572 --> 00:38:55.816
Some of them have been here
since the beginning of time.

512
00:38:55.919 --> 00:38:57.714
What if I could
quadruple your income?

513
00:38:57.818 --> 00:39:00.476
I'll miss them.
You were saying?

514
00:39:02.926 --> 00:39:05.377
Sorry I'm late.
I had car trouble.

515
00:39:05.481 --> 00:39:07.034
Picked up
a nail.

516
00:39:07.137 --> 00:39:09.485
Thank you for sharing that
with us, Mr. Flagstone.

517
00:39:09.588 --> 00:39:12.419
F...
May we continue?

518
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.906
Mr. Slate. Gentlemen.

519
00:39:17.009 --> 00:39:19.529
I have... a vision.

520
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.638
While our competitors are
mired in the Stone Age,

521
00:39:24.741 --> 00:39:27.641
I give you...
the future!

522
00:39:27.744 --> 00:39:30.747
- Oh!
- Slate and Company...

523
00:39:30.851 --> 00:39:33.094
will revolutionize
the building industry...

524
00:39:33.198 --> 00:39:35.476
by providing simple,

525
00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.134
low-cost,
modular housing units.

526
00:39:38.237 --> 00:39:40.067
Impossible, you say?

527
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.483
Let me demonstrate.

528
00:39:42.587 --> 00:39:45.452
Through the miracle
of geothermal power,

529
00:39:45.555 --> 00:39:49.041
the raw material is elevated
to the second stage,

530
00:39:49.145 --> 00:39:52.010
where our steam-powered
conveyor belt carries... Steam?

531
00:39:52.113 --> 00:39:54.253
He's a madman!

532
00:39:54.357 --> 00:39:57.049
Steam-powered
conveyor belts...

533
00:39:57.153 --> 00:40:00.984
carry the product to be
shaped, cleaned, inspected...

534
00:40:01.088 --> 00:40:05.023
and delivered to discerning
consumers worldwide.

535
00:40:06.852 --> 00:40:10.373
And did I mention increasing
our profit margin...

536
00:40:10.477 --> 00:40:11.892
fourfold?

537
00:40:11.995 --> 00:40:14.342
Very impressive,
Mr. Vandercave.

538
00:40:14.446 --> 00:40:18.968
Very impressive. I think we should
implement this system immediately.

539
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.696
Yes?

540
00:40:22.799 --> 00:40:25.319
Excuse me, Mr. Slate.
I know I'm the new man here,

541
00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:28.633
but I don't think you hired me
just to sit around and look pretty.

542
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.843
Uh, I hate to
bust your bubble,

543
00:40:31.946 --> 00:40:33.914
but if you build houses
this small,

544
00:40:34.017 --> 00:40:35.778
who's gonna live in 'em?

545
00:40:42.509 --> 00:40:45.166
- Excuse me. Mrs. Rubble?
- Yes.

546
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:48.100
There seems to be a slight
problem with your credit card.

547
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:51.276
Really?
And what would that be?

548
00:40:51.379 --> 00:40:53.105
It's no damn good!

549
00:41:01.597 --> 00:41:04.979
I have never been so
embarrassed in my entire life.

550
00:41:05.083 --> 00:41:09.846
Go and play, children. Wilma, I promise you
I'll pay you back.

551
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:13.505
I just don't know when.
Oh, now, Betty.

552
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:16.646
It can't be as bad
as all that. But it is.

553
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:20.478
Barney's still out of work.
We've nearly spent all of our savings.

554
00:41:20.581 --> 00:41:24.516
And, Wilma, what if the
adoption agency finds out?

555
00:41:28.382 --> 00:41:31.178
I don't want to
lose my baby.

556
00:41:31.281 --> 00:41:35.838
I swear, Betty,
Fred and I would never let that happen.

557
00:41:35.941 --> 00:41:38.496
Oh, Wilma.
Oh, Betty.

558
00:41:43.155 --> 00:41:46.607
Pterodactyl alert!

559
00:41:46.711 --> 00:41:49.645
Mommy, help!

560
00:41:55.202 --> 00:41:56.893
Ugh!

561
00:41:56.997 --> 00:41:59.102
And in conclusion,
Mr. Slate,

562
00:41:59.206 --> 00:42:02.623
I feel that a paid vacation for everyone
in the quarry would raise morale...

563
00:42:02.727 --> 00:42:04.591
and increase productivity,

564
00:42:04.694 --> 00:42:07.352
um, um,
a whole bunch!

565
00:42:07.455 --> 00:42:10.389
Sincerely yours,
Frederick J. Flintstone.

566
00:42:10.493 --> 00:42:13.669
Shall I make that "Flagstone,"
so he'll know who it's from?

567
00:42:13.772 --> 00:42:16.568
My, don't we look
handsome today.

568
00:42:16.672 --> 00:42:18.432
Thank you.

569
00:42:18.536 --> 00:42:20.986
Here are today's batch
of requisitions,

570
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:23.782
all marked and ready
for your signature.Okay.

571
00:42:25.577 --> 00:42:28.994
You know, Miss Stone, I've been signing
stacks of these things for weeks now,

572
00:42:29.098 --> 00:42:31.997
and I hate to pry,
but what are they?

573
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.104
Oh, just
tiny little forms...

574
00:42:35.207 --> 00:42:38.176
so that we can pay the contractors
working on the modernization.

575
00:42:41.075 --> 00:42:44.009
You know, we remodeled our
kitchen a couple of years ago,

576
00:42:44.113 --> 00:42:48.669
and let me tell you,
contractors can be real pirates.

577
00:42:48.773 --> 00:42:51.361
I'm gonna
read these over. No!

578
00:42:53.847 --> 00:42:57.540
You're much too busy for that,
Mr. Flintstone.

579
00:42:57.644 --> 00:42:59.577
Besides,

580
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.614
reading is my job.

581
00:43:02.718 --> 00:43:05.790
You wouldn't want to put
poor little old me...

582
00:43:05.893 --> 00:43:08.275
out of work,
now, would you?

583
00:43:08.378 --> 00:43:10.760
No.

584
00:43:14.695 --> 00:43:17.456
Your wife.
Mm-mmm.

585
00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.011
Your wife. My wife.
Wilma?

586
00:43:20.114 --> 00:43:23.739
- Wilma! What a surprise!
- So it would seem.

587
00:43:23.842 --> 00:43:26.673
Miss Stone, I'd like you to
meet my wife, Mrs. Flagstone,

588
00:43:26.776 --> 00:43:29.537
and our daughter,
um... um, um... um...

589
00:43:29.641 --> 00:43:31.781
Isn't she beautiful?
My family.

590
00:43:31.885 --> 00:43:35.267
- I've heard so much about you. - Well,
I wish that I could say the same.

591
00:43:35.371 --> 00:43:39.237
That'll be all, Miss Stone. I'll sign those
documents and place them on your desk.

592
00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.170
Whatever you want.

593
00:43:46.727 --> 00:43:51.042
Your secretary
is very attractive. Really? I hadn't noticed.

594
00:43:51.145 --> 00:43:54.010
Did I mention she chisels
18 words a minute? Hmm.

595
00:43:55.874 --> 00:43:59.153
Hey, Wilma, did ya ever see
one of these?

596
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:03.261
My wife is the most
beautiful gal in Bedrock.

597
00:44:03.364 --> 00:44:06.713
- "My wife is the most beautiful
gal in Bedrock." - Nice try, Fred.

598
00:44:06.816 --> 00:44:09.785
"Nice try, Fred."

599
00:44:09.888 --> 00:44:14.065
Fred! I've come to talk
about the Rubbles' troubles.

600
00:44:14.168 --> 00:44:15.998
What's the matter?
Hasn't Barney found a job yet?

601
00:44:16.101 --> 00:44:20.140
It's gotten so bad, they've had to rent
out their house just to make ends meet.

602
00:44:20.243 --> 00:44:23.108
Really?
Where are they gonna live?

603
00:44:27.492 --> 00:44:31.599
So glad you're over
your cold.

604
00:44:31.703 --> 00:44:33.740
Thank you.

605
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:45.027
Isn't this nice, Betty?

606
00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:48.513
The Flintstones and the
Rubbles, all under one roof.

607
00:44:48.616 --> 00:44:52.586
Yes, but, Wilma, this is such an imposition.
Are you sure it's okay with Fred?

608
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.244
Oh, absolutely.

609
00:44:55.347 --> 00:44:59.973
As a matter of fact, he thinks
it was his idea. -

610
00:45:00.076 --> 00:45:04.149
Hey, Freddie,
a couple of cool ones. Oh, yeah.

611
00:45:08.602 --> 00:45:11.225
How about it, Barn?

612
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:13.676
Flintstones and Rubbles
under one roof.

613
00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.436
Yeah, but Fred, you know,
it's only temporary.

614
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.300
It better be.

615
00:45:20.269 --> 00:45:22.305
It better be! Yeah!

616
00:45:22.409 --> 00:45:25.377
Aw, Barn, I admire ya.
You've lost your job, your dignity,

617
00:45:25.481 --> 00:45:27.690
but not your sense of humor.

618
00:45:29.519 --> 00:45:32.384
Fred. Cut it out, Fred.

619
00:45:34.179 --> 00:45:35.940
Hey, Barn. You like
your steak rare?

620
00:45:36.043 --> 00:45:38.183
Yeah. That one's yours.

621
00:45:38.287 --> 00:45:41.669
Hey, hey, stop! Come here,
you purple rodent!

622
00:45:41.773 --> 00:45:45.846
Hey, Barn. Don't forget to wash
that off before you eat it!

623
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:47.883
Hey! Come here!
Give me that!

624
00:45:49.574 --> 00:45:51.507
Help! Somebody!

625
00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:54.855
Whoa!

626
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.998
Whoo-hoo!

627
00:46:19.086 --> 00:46:20.985
Flintstone gets the rock.

628
00:46:21.088 --> 00:46:23.194
He sets his shot.
He shoots!

629
00:46:24.436 --> 00:46:26.300
Oh!

630
00:46:26.404 --> 00:46:29.096
Oh! Oh, boy.

631
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.444
Why, Miss Stone,
what a pleasant surprise.

632
00:46:32.548 --> 00:46:34.446
Oh.
What happened here?

633
00:46:36.103 --> 00:46:39.555
- That's what I'd like to know!
- I'll get someone to fix it.

634
00:46:39.658 --> 00:46:41.488
Oh, Miss Stone?

635
00:46:41.591 --> 00:46:44.525
Before you go, there's
something bothering me...

636
00:46:44.629 --> 00:46:47.563
- about this new system
we're putting in here. - Oh?

637
00:46:47.666 --> 00:46:50.359
Yeah. I mean,
I don't pretend to understand it all,

638
00:46:50.462 --> 00:46:53.327
but wouldn't this thing put
a lot of my guys out of work?

639
00:46:53.431 --> 00:46:57.090
How would I know?
I'm just a little ol' secretary.

640
00:46:57.193 --> 00:46:59.678
Are you kiddin' me?
You're smart.

641
00:46:59.782 --> 00:47:01.542
I mean, I could tell
that right off.

642
00:47:01.646 --> 00:47:05.581
There's a lot more to
you than you... uh... uh...

643
00:47:05.684 --> 00:47:08.515
You... I mean... Thank you.

644
00:47:13.382 --> 00:47:15.039
Mr. Flintstone?

645
00:47:15.142 --> 00:47:18.974
I sure hope I didn't get you into too much
trouble with your wife the other day.

646
00:47:19.077 --> 00:47:22.909
Nah. Wilma always forgives me.
She knows I love her.

647
00:47:23.012 --> 00:47:25.463
And you do, don't you? Are you kiddin'?

648
00:47:25.566 --> 00:47:29.639
I'll never forget the first time I met
her. She was working at a restaurant,

649
00:47:29.743 --> 00:47:33.920
and I won this all-you-can-eat contest,
and she was the one to clean me off.

650
00:47:34.023 --> 00:47:37.337
Every night I go home,
and I look at her, and I think,

651
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.860
"What is a beautiful woman like that
doing with a big galoot like me?"

652
00:47:43.964 --> 00:47:45.379
I think I know.

653
00:47:49.832 --> 00:47:52.352
Where have
you been? With Fred.

654
00:47:52.455 --> 00:47:54.630
I mean, Mr. Flintstone.

655
00:47:54.733 --> 00:47:57.875
I'm worried, Cliff.
He's smarter than we thought.

656
00:47:57.978 --> 00:48:00.670
He'd have to be to
get himself dressed in the morning.

657
00:48:00.774 --> 00:48:02.880
He's been asking
a lot of questions.

658
00:48:02.983 --> 00:48:05.158
I think we should just
call the whole thing off.

659
00:48:06.193 --> 00:48:09.679
No. No, I've got
a better idea.

660
00:48:09.783 --> 00:48:12.234
Why don't we
turn ourselves in,

661
00:48:12.337 --> 00:48:15.340
then we can rot in jail
until the poles freeze over.

662
00:48:15.444 --> 00:48:19.172
I was just thinking... Stick to your strengths,
Miss Stone.

663
00:48:20.759 --> 00:48:22.658
And I'll stick to mine.

664
00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:25.385
Besides,

665
00:48:26.696 --> 00:48:32.116
if Mr. Flintstone insists
on being so conscientious,

666
00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:34.912
perhaps we can give
Fred...

667
00:48:35.015 --> 00:48:37.984
something to take his
mind off work, hmm?

668
00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:41.988
A bonus? That's right, Fred.

669
00:48:42.091 --> 00:48:44.128
- You deserve it.
- For what?

670
00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:47.476
Don't be modest,
you go-getter, you.

671
00:48:47.579 --> 00:48:50.513
Oh, and, Fred, let me let you in
on a little secret.

672
00:48:50.617 --> 00:48:54.069
If you really want to become a

But, Fred, isn't this all
too much too fast?

695
00:50:44.524 --> 00:50:47.768
Wilma, in the buffet of life
there are no second helpings.

696
00:50:47.872 --> 00:50:50.047
You gotta fill up your
plate, top off your cup...

697
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:54.051
and stuff a few rolls in

Mmm. Frisky!

00:51:01.092 --> 00:51:03.163
You know, Barney,
life's funny.

701
00:51:03.267 --> 00:51:05.890
One minute people
are your best friends,

702
00:51:05.993 --> 00:51:10.377
and the next you're fantasizing they're being
ripped apart by a pack of rabid wolves.

703
00:51:10.481 --> 00:51:13.484
You too, huh? Oh, Barney,
they've changed.

704
00:51:13.587 --> 00:51:15.934
I hardly know them since
Fred's become such a big shot.

705
00:51:16.038 --> 00:51:19.973
Yeah. And it should be us that's squanderin' all
our money and treatin' our friends like dirt.

706
00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:22.148
What do you mean?

707
00:51:22.251 --> 00:51:24.150
Oh, nothin'.

708
00:51:26.048 --> 00:51:27.981
Just sour grapes,
I guess.

709
00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:29.983
Oh, don't worry,
Barney.

710
00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:31.950
It's gonna get better.

711
00:51:32.054 --> 00:51:35.333
One day we're gonna look back
on all this and we'll laugh.

712
00:51:35.437 --> 00:51:39.096
Geez, I hope so, Betty, 'cause tomorrow
they got me testin' shark repellent.

713
00:51:39.199 --> 00:51:41.615
Hmm?
Oh, Barney.

714
00:51:41.719 --> 00:51:42.720
Ooh.

715
00:51:46.689 --> 00:51:49.002
Leaving early?

716
00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:52.799
Actually, the wife and I were gonna have a
little dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green.

717
00:51:52.902 --> 00:51:57.183
Ooh, pricey. Be sure to put
that on your expense account.

718
00:51:57.286 --> 00:51:59.392
Fred, before you go...

719
00:51:59.495 --> 00:52:03.534
would you mind chipping your
"X" on a couple of these? Yeah, sure. What are they?

720
00:52:03.637 --> 00:52:08.194
Well, you sign these, and all your buddies down
in the quarry get some much-needed time off.

721
00:52:08.297 --> 00:52:13.130
No kiddin'! Well, I guess Mr. Slate finally
noticed all those memos I been sendin' in.

722
00:52:13.233 --> 00:52:16.581
I hope the guys will
know who's to thank for this.

723
00:52:17.651 --> 00:52:19.722
I'll make sure
you get all the credit.

724
00:52:27.489 --> 00:52:29.456
Mr. Flintstone,
up to now our relationship...

725
00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:33.011
has not been based on mutuality
of admiration or respect. Huh?

726
00:52:33.115 --> 00:52:36.636
Well, put more simply, you hate my bird
guts, and I think you're dumber than mud.

727
00:52:36.739 --> 00:52:40.778
- Ah. Well, good night. - Still,
I wish to pass on an old dictum...

728
00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:42.849
from business school
that may be apropos here.

729
00:52:42.952 --> 00:52:45.714
Only an idiot signs
something before reading it.

730
00:52:45.817 --> 00:52:49.718
Excuse me. I'm the executive.
You're the office equipment.

731
00:52:49.821 --> 00:52:52.686

equipment for advice,

Good night!

756
00:54:28.575 --> 00:54:32.993
How 'bout a spin, Betty? Oh, no, thank you, Fred.
I'll wait till Barney gets here.

757
00:54:33.097 --> 00:54:36.065
He started some new job today.
I'm not sure what time he gets done.

758
00:54:36.169 --> 00:54:38.447
While we're waiting,
how about another carafe of the bubbly?

759
00:54:38.551 --> 00:54:40.622
Garçon!
Whoops.

760
00:54:40.725 --> 00:54:43.141
Don't worry, Mr. Flintstone.
I'll have that taken care of right away.

761
00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.009
Table seven, sonny.

762
00:54:55.947 --> 00:54:57.604
Barney!

763
00:54:57.708 --> 00:55:01.021
Barney! Hey, nice skins.
Sit down, take a load off!

764
00:55:01.125 --> 00:55:05.232
- I can't, Fred. I'm working here.
- You're a busboy?

765
00:55:05.336 --> 00:55:09.961
- It's honest work. - Yeah, and I
don't have to fight Dino for my supper.

766
00:55:10.065 --> 00:55:14.863
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll get you a fresh tablecloth, sir.

767
00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:21.801
See, Wilma? And you were worried he'd never
find a job and we'd be stuck with him forever.

768
00:55:29.153 --> 00:55:32.121
Flintstone! Flintstone!

769
00:55:32.225 --> 00:55:34.192
No way! We want Flintstone!

770
00:55:34.296 --> 00:55:39.163
And the demonstration continues
to get uglier at Slate and Company...

771
00:55:39.266 --> 00:55:41.165
following
the unexpected layoff...

772
00:55:41.268 --> 00:55:43.098
of virtually
the entire labor force...

773
00:55:43.201 --> 00:55:45.480
by V.P. Fred Flintstone.

774
00:55:45.583 --> 00:55:48.690
For the Cave News Network,
this is Susan Rock.

775
00:55:48.793 --> 00:55:50.830
Fred, did you hear what happened
to everyone at the quarry today?

776
00:55:50.933 --> 00:55:54.523
Yep. A few hours ago, I sent them
all off on a nice, long vacation.

777
00:55:54.627 --> 00:55:57.699
You mean a permanent vacation.
He fired them!

778
00:55:57.802 --> 00:55:59.942
Fred!
How could you?

779
00:56:00.046 --> 00:56:02.945
- I didn't do that.
- You did too! It's all over the TV!

780
00:56:03.049 --> 00:56:07.156
- Fred! - Wilma, who are you
gonna believe... me or some busboy?

781
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:10.090
That busboy is
your best friend!

782
00:56:10.194 --> 00:56:14.371
Best friend? Best friend? I lost my best
friend the day I became an executive!

783
00:56:14.474 --> 00:56:17.132
He's just jealous
of my hard-earned success.

784
00:56:17.235 --> 00:56:21.274
Hard-earned?
Tell me something, Mr. Vice President,

785
00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:24.242
what's a graduated
inventory plan, huh?

786
00:56:24.346 --> 00:56:26.452
How about supply and demand?

787
00:56:26.555 --> 00:56:30.007
Hey, Fred!
What's two and two?

788
00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:33.286
I didn't come here to talk business.
I'm out with my wife.

789
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:36.669
Now,
get me a clean spoon.

790
00:56:37.946 --> 00:56:39.430
That does it!

791
00:56:39.534 --> 00:56:44.435
The only reason you got that job is
'cause I switched tests with you.

792
00:56:44.539 --> 00:56:48.543
- Oh, Barney.
- Oh-ho-ho, that's rich!

793
00:56:48.646 --> 00:56:50.614
What good would it do me
to switch tests...

794
00:56:50.717 --> 00:56:53.720
with the guy that got the
lowest score in the quarry?

795
00:56:53.824 --> 00:56:58.760
- Think about it, Fred.
- Oh, finally it all makes sense.

796
00:56:58.863 --> 00:57:01.141
You don't believe this,
do you?

797
00:57:01.245 --> 00:57:03.558
Are you calling
my husband a liar?

798
00:57:03.661 --> 00:57:05.422
Now this has gone
far enough.

799
00:57:05.525 --> 00:57:10.461
After everything that we've done
for you. We took you into our home.

800
00:57:10.565 --> 00:57:14.016
Oh, yeah? So you could show off
every chance you got! -

801
00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.536
You used to be such
nice people, but now,

802
00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.849
you're just a couple of
rich snobs! Hmm!

803
00:57:20.229 --> 00:57:22.991
Better than being
a couple of petty ingrates.

804
00:57:23.094 --> 00:57:27.236
Come on, Barney.
We are moving out... tonight!

805
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.205
Hang on, Betty.
I forgot to punch out.

806
00:57:51.985 --> 00:57:55.161
Eh, put it up top.

807
00:57:55.264 --> 00:57:58.751
Betty, please.
We can work it out.

808
00:57:58.854 --> 00:58:01.374
We're all
civilized people here.

809
00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:04.032
It's too late, Wilma.

810
00:58:04.135 --> 00:58:08.174
Come on. I mean, we all said
things that we didn't mean.

811
00:58:08.277 --> 00:58:10.038
Speak for yourself.

812
00:58:10.141 --> 00:58:12.316
Come on, Betty.
Time to hit the road.

813
00:58:12.419 --> 00:58:16.631
Fred! Aren't you even
the least bit sorry?

814
00:58:16.734 --> 00:58:20.151
Sure, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I
ever met the little moocher.

815
00:58:22.153 --> 00:58:24.121
Oh, Betty.

816
00:58:24.224 --> 00:58:26.572
Good-bye, Wilma.Oh.

817
00:58:48.317 --> 00:58:52.218
They're gone.

818
00:58:55.428 --> 00:59:00.260
I cannot believe you just sat there
and let them walk out of our lives.

819
00:59:00.364 --> 00:59:02.884
At least I can walk around the
house in my underwear again.

820
00:59:02.987 --> 00:59:06.577
And that is more important to
you than 20 years of friendship?

821
00:59:06.681 --> 00:59:08.648
It is on a hot day.

822
00:59:08.752 --> 00:59:11.651
- They were
holding us back, Wilma.

823
00:59:11.755 --> 00:59:16.345
We'll make new friends. There's
4,000 other people in this world.

824
00:59:16.449 --> 00:59:19.417
- Who needs the Rubbles?
- I do.

825
00:59:19.521 --> 00:59:22.628
But I'll tell you
what I don't need.

826
00:59:22.731 --> 00:59:25.872
I don't need...
this necklace.

827
00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:30.152
You know,
I don't need this lamp.

828
00:59:31.464 --> 00:59:35.192
And I don't need
this television set.

829
00:59:35.295 --> 00:59:37.470
Not the TV!

830
00:59:37.574 --> 00:59:40.059
I don't need this.

831
00:59:40.162 --> 00:59:43.545
I don't need this.
Oh!

832
00:59:43.649 --> 00:59:47.860
I don't think I'll be needing any
of this bone china. -

833
00:59:47.963 --> 00:59:51.346
Because I don't have
any friends to invite to dinner.

834
00:59:51.449 --> 00:59:55.902
So, I don't think I'll be using
any of these cups or saucers.

835
00:59:56.006 --> 01:00:01.287
Oh, you're gonna regret this, Wilma. It's
gonna take you hours to clean up this mess.

836
01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.885
All right, Wilma.
Enough of this charade.

837
01:00:12.988 --> 01:00:16.543
Come back now, and I'll forgive ya.

838
01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:19.408
Oh, you're bluffin',
Wilma Slaghoople.

839
01:00:19.512 --> 01:00:22.135
You're not going
to your mother's.

840
01:00:22.239 --> 01:00:24.448
Once around the block,
you'll realize...

841
01:00:24.551 --> 01:00:28.176
the folly of your ways,
and you'll come crawling back.

842
01:00:31.766 --> 01:00:33.802
Please.

843
01:01:01.174 --> 01:01:05.144
It's finally happened.
I've become my father.

844
01:01:05.247 --> 01:01:07.767
Oh, now, Barney,
don't talk like that.

845
01:01:07.871 --> 01:01:10.805
This place is fine
for now. Come on, Betty.

846
01:01:10.908 --> 01:01:13.739
We're living downwind
from a family of wild boars.

847
01:01:13.842 --> 01:01:17.225
Face it. We've hit
rock bottom.

848
01:01:19.572 --> 01:01:22.023
Come here,
little guy.

849
01:01:23.093 --> 01:01:26.165
Can you say dada?
Say dada.

850
01:01:26.268 --> 01:01:28.961
Bamm-Bamm! Oh.

851
01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:32.481
It doesn't really matter where we
live, as long as we're together.

852
01:01:32.585 --> 01:01:34.932
Family hug!

853
01:01:43.285 --> 01:01:45.115
Betty? Hmm?

854
01:01:45.218 --> 01:01:49.291
Exactly where did
you get those eggs?

855
01:01:52.536 --> 01:01:54.538
Sorry.

856
01:01:54.641 --> 01:01:58.576
I think it
might be twins.

857
01:02:03.685 --> 01:02:05.756
There he is!

858
01:02:09.035 --> 01:02:11.417
You're a traitor,
Flintstone!

859
01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.661
Listen to me.
I'm your friend. You're no friend of ours!

860
01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:18.217
And you're a rotten
bowler too!

861
01:02:29.711 --> 01:02:31.506
Good morning,
Mr. Flint...

862
01:02:43.725 --> 01:02:47.867
They made a fool out of me. - Well, look
what they had to work with.

863
01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.010
Flintstone,
heard you were down in the file room.

864
01:02:53.114 --> 01:02:54.978
Find anything interesting?

865
01:02:55.081 --> 01:02:57.566
Yeah. I'm onto
your little scam.

866
01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:00.569
Billing phony companies and
keeping the money for yourself.

867
01:03:00.673 --> 01:03:03.434
- I'm going to Mr. Slate.
- Good idea.

868
01:03:03.538 --> 01:03:06.403
Turning yourself in might buy
you a little bit of leniency.

869
01:03:06.506 --> 01:03:09.786
Me? This entire scheme
was your idea.True.

870
01:03:09.889 --> 01:03:13.065
But I've graciously decided
to give you all the credit...

871
01:03:13.168 --> 01:03:15.032
since it's your name
on the requisitions.

872
01:03:15.136 --> 01:03:16.931
I never touched
any of that money.

873
01:03:17.034 --> 01:03:19.692
Hmm. Fred, please.

874
01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:24.559
Remodeling your house, furs, jewelry,
a fully-equipped Le Sabertooth.

875
01:03:24.662 --> 01:03:28.218
- Tsk, tsk, tsk. You should have
been more discreet. - I'm innocent!

876
01:03:28.321 --> 01:03:32.049
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.
Miss Stone, call security.

877
01:03:32.153 --> 01:03:34.189
Tell them we've
uncovered an embezzler.

878
01:03:34.293 --> 01:03:38.055
Miss Stone,
you'll back me up, won't ya?

879
01:03:39.298 --> 01:03:41.887
You better run while
you still have a chance.

880
01:03:44.717 --> 01:03:46.443
You'll never get away
with this.

881
01:03:46.546 --> 01:03:48.963
I already have.

882
01:04:02.562 --> 01:04:06.359
Here comes
the pterodactyl.

883
01:04:08.361 --> 01:04:12.227
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- It's no use, Mother.

884
01:04:12.331 --> 01:04:14.609
She misses Fred.

885
01:04:14.712 --> 01:04:19.200
- I hope it's not
that pesky Avrock lady again.

886
01:04:19.303 --> 01:04:21.133
Oh!

887
01:04:22.272 --> 01:04:24.136
Betty! Oh.

888
01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:27.277
- Bamm-Bamm!
- I have missed you so much.

889
01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:32.075
I don't care what Barney said. I
couldn't let you go through this alone.

890
01:04:32.178 --> 01:04:35.319
Have you heard
from Fred? No.

891
01:04:39.116 --> 01:04:41.153
I spoke to a lawyer.

892
01:04:41.256 --> 01:04:44.673
If he's missing seven years,
you can remarry.

893
01:04:44.777 --> 01:04:47.331
Mother!

894
01:04:47.435 --> 01:04:52.440
Well, wherever Fred is,
I hope he knows I still love him.

895
01:04:52.543 --> 01:04:54.580
Oh.

896
01:04:54.683 --> 01:04:58.929
Calling all
Bedrock units, all Bedrock units.

897
01:05:09.491 --> 01:05:12.356
Tonight, in a special
edition ofBedrock's Most Wanted,

898
01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:15.428
we bring you the story
that's rocked our city,

899
01:05:15.532 --> 01:05:18.535
"The Case
of the Embezzling Executive."

900
01:05:22.228 --> 01:05:24.472
Mr. Flintstone,
what are you doing?

901
01:05:24.575 --> 01:05:28.510
I'm an executive.
I'm embezzling.

902
01:05:28.614 --> 01:05:30.271
I'm shocked!

903
01:05:30.374 --> 01:05:33.895
How could you ever
marry that man?

904
01:05:33.999 --> 01:05:37.347
Mother!
That man is not my husband.

905
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:40.937
That's right. He plays Dr. Gravelman
on The Young and the Thumbless.

906
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.526
Fred might be a lot of things,
but a thief is not one of them.

907
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:47.115
- Can you prove it?
- Who cares?

908
01:05:47.219 --> 01:05:49.462
Yabba-dabba-dabba!

909
01:05:49.566 --> 01:05:52.465
Yabba-dabba-dabba! - This menace remains at large.

910
01:05:52.569 --> 01:05:54.743
We ask the public's help
in apprehending... Maybe I can.

911
01:05:54.847 --> 01:05:56.504
Bedrock's most wanted.

912
01:06:14.246 --> 01:06:18.077
Hey, brother. A little something to take
that chill off. Take a swig of this.

913
01:06:18.181 --> 01:06:21.839
Put hair on your knuckles.

914
01:06:21.943 --> 01:06:26.154
Tell me something... You one of those guys that
was laid off up there at the stone quarry?

915
01:06:26.258 --> 01:06:28.053
Yeah, I used to work there.

916
01:06:28.156 --> 01:06:29.882
A lot of guys down here...

917
01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:33.541
would like to get their hands on the
guy who's responsible for all this.

918
01:06:33.644 --> 01:06:38.028
- So they could hear his side of the
story? - What? His side of the story?

919
01:06:42.239 --> 01:06:46.071
Huh?
Flintstone!

920
01:06:46.174 --> 01:06:48.073
Flintstone!

921
01:06:51.559 --> 01:06:54.424
It is!
Flintstone!

922
01:06:58.531 --> 01:07:00.740
Squealer!

923
01:07:00.844 --> 01:07:02.811
Get him!

924
01:07:08.093 --> 01:07:10.440
Just think.
This time tomorrow,

925
01:07:10.543 --> 01:07:13.650
we'll be on a pterodactyl
winging our w...

926
01:07:13.753 --> 01:07:16.549
- Oh, Cliff.
- Hmm?

927
01:07:16.653 --> 01:07:19.690
How come there's only
one ticket to Rocapulco?

928
01:07:22.314 --> 01:07:26.904
For your protection, darling. I thought
I would go on a "business trip,"

929
01:07:27.008 --> 01:07:28.872
while you stay here to keep up
appearances.

930
01:07:28.975 --> 01:07:32.151
Then, when we're sure it's
safe, I'll send for you.

931
01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:35.810
Forgive me, Cliff.

932
01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.124
Looks like you've
thought of everything.

933
01:07:51.584 --> 01:07:54.104
Psst.

934
01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:56.279
Excuse me!

935
01:07:57.763 --> 01:08:01.007
Hello. No, Mumsie, I don't want
to go to school.

936
01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:04.287
The other boys
make fun of me.

937
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:06.496
Wake up!

938
01:08:06.599 --> 01:08:11.673
Oh, Mrs. Flintstone. To what do
I owe the honor of this break-in?

939
01:08:11.777 --> 01:08:13.986
I need your help,
Mr. Bird.

940
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:17.231
- You hear everything that goes
on in this office. - Mm-hmm.

941
01:08:17.334 --> 01:08:20.682
You are the only one who
can help clear my husband.

942
01:08:20.786 --> 01:08:24.962
My, my! What a delicious irony.
Thank you for sharing it with me.

943
01:08:25.066 --> 01:08:29.105
Now, let me share something with you.

944
01:08:30.554 --> 01:08:33.247
Oh, now, Wilma,
calm down.

945
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:36.284
Maybe I can
reason with him.

946
01:08:36.388 --> 01:08:37.630
Ow!

947
01:08:37.734 --> 01:08:39.908
There. All set.

948
01:08:41.358 --> 01:08:44.948
You know, my only regret
is I won't be around...

949
01:08:45.051 --> 01:08:50.195
when that shoddy new equipment
blows up in their big, dumb faces.

950
01:08:50.298 --> 01:08:54.785
Oh, well, I'll just have to
console myself with all that money.

951
01:08:55.924 --> 01:08:59.756
Hey, who's that?

952
01:09:04.623 --> 01:09:06.452
That's Flintstone's wife.

953
01:09:06.556 --> 01:09:09.766
What would she want with
a stinky old dict...

954
01:09:09.869 --> 01:09:12.562
Son of a brachiosaurus!

955
01:09:12.665 --> 01:09:17.153
Well, Cliff. I guess you
haven't thought of everything.

956
01:09:18.223 --> 01:09:21.053
Oh, this is
far from over.

957
01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:30.959
String him up!

958
01:09:31.063 --> 01:09:33.099
Wait! You can't do this.
I was framed!

959
01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:37.207
In a minute you're gonna be boxed.

960
01:09:39.761 --> 01:09:43.765
♪♪ Anybody want a snow cone?

961
01:09:43.869 --> 01:09:46.734
- Barney!
- Fred!

962
01:09:46.837 --> 01:09:49.081
- What are you doing here?
- I'm getting lynched!

963
01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:53.396
Oh. I got cherry,
lime, rocky road.

964
01:09:53.499 --> 01:09:55.846
Wait a minute.
Do you know this guy?

965
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:58.884
Know him? He used to be
my best friend.

966
01:09:58.987 --> 01:10:02.957
Heck, in a way, if it wasn't for me, this
whole mess probably wouldn't have happened.

967
01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:08.894
Thanks for filling us in, mister. We
could've made a very big mistake here.

968
01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:10.930
- Hang both of 'em.
- What? Hey!

969
01:10:11.034 --> 01:10:14.071
Gee, take it easy. They make
you pay for your own uniforms.

970
01:10:14.175 --> 01:10:16.142
Hey, hey, hey!

971
01:10:16.246 --> 01:10:19.560
Barney, I thought
you came to save me.

972
01:10:19.663 --> 01:10:23.702
Save you? I saw a crowd,
I figured I'd sell a few snow cones.

973
01:10:23.805 --> 01:10:26.808
You mean you haven't
forgiven me yet? Nope.

974
01:10:26.912 --> 01:10:29.052
And frankly, I don't think
this is gonna help.

975
01:10:29.155 --> 01:10:31.537
- I took a cherry.
- I can't break a 20.

976
01:10:31.641 --> 01:10:34.851
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait a minute!

977
01:10:34.954 --> 01:10:38.993
Look, Barn, I know you're
still a little mad at me.

978
01:10:39.096 --> 01:10:43.618
But I want you to know, that if I had
to have someone hanging next to me,

979
01:10:43.722 --> 01:10:45.310
I'm glad it's you.

980
01:10:48.313 --> 01:10:52.006
I guess switchin' them tests didn't
turn out much like I planned, huh, Fred?

981
01:10:52.109 --> 01:10:54.146
Hey, got any lemon?

982
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.321
Check in the back.

983
01:10:56.424 --> 01:10:59.945
Gee, why can't business
be this good every day?

984
01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:02.603
The story of my life.

985
01:11:02.706 --> 01:11:05.778
- I'm a loser.
- No, you're not.

986
01:11:05.882 --> 01:11:07.504
This makes me a winner?

987
01:11:07.608 --> 01:11:09.817
No, but you're the best friend
a guy ever had,

988
01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.889
and that makes you a winner
in my book, pal.

989
01:11:12.992 --> 01:11:17.065
Me, I'm just a big jerk.

990
01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:21.449
Ah, everybody loves you,
Fred.

991
01:11:21.553 --> 01:11:23.313
Except, of course,
for this lynch mob.

992
01:11:23.417 --> 01:11:25.936
Aw, Barn.

993
01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.353
Aw, Fred.

994
01:11:32.184 --> 01:11:35.291
Come on. Come on. You'll have plenty
of time to bond in the afterlife.

995
01:11:38.639 --> 01:11:41.918
Wilma, look!

996
01:11:46.198 --> 01:11:48.338
Watch out for that tree!

997
01:11:52.515 --> 01:11:55.345
Now wait, everybody.

998
01:11:56.864 --> 01:12:00.074
Fred is innocent.

999
01:12:00.177 --> 01:12:03.526
Barney, do you have to do
everything Fred does?

1000
01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:07.184
Everybody,
listen to him.

1001
01:12:07.288 --> 01:12:12.051
First things first.
I demand an apology.

1002
01:12:12.155 --> 01:12:15.952
- I'm sorry!
- Not you. Him.

1003
01:12:16.055 --> 01:12:19.162
Me? Apologize to a bird?

1004
01:12:19.265 --> 01:12:22.372
Not Fred Flintstone.

1005
01:12:22.476 --> 01:12:25.306
I had hoped we might be colleagues,
but instead, you've treated me as if...

1006
01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:27.791
I were an ordinary
piece of office furniture.

1007
01:12:27.895 --> 01:12:30.484
I may eat bugs, but I have
feelings, Mr. Flintstone.

1008
01:12:30.587 --> 01:12:33.832
And you've hurt them. Aw.

1009
01:12:36.455 --> 01:12:41.495
Uh, well, look, I know I could've
been a little more sensitive.

1010
01:12:41.598 --> 01:12:44.221
- Especially when you were molting.
- Oh.

1011
01:12:44.325 --> 01:12:46.603
So, uh, I'm sorry.

1012
01:12:46.707 --> 01:12:49.744
I don't think
they heard you in the back.

1013
01:12:49.848 --> 01:12:53.299
- I'm sorry.
- Pardon?

1014
01:12:53.403 --> 01:12:55.819
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1015
01:12:58.615 --> 01:13:00.652
Now then,
gather round, everyone.

1016
01:13:00.755 --> 01:13:04.345
I'll tell you the tale
of an unsophisticated man...

1017
01:13:04.449 --> 01:13:07.106
caught up in
a treacherous web of power,

1018
01:13:07.210 --> 01:13:09.626
deceit and lust.

1019
01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:12.008
Ooh, yeah.

1020
01:13:13.630 --> 01:13:16.840
Why is the door open? Hey, what?

1021
01:13:18.532 --> 01:13:21.155
Betty.
Oh, Betty, the door is open! Wilma, something's wrong!

1022
01:13:27.264 --> 01:13:29.853
Pebbles! Bamm-Bamm!

1023
01:13:32.546 --> 01:13:35.859
What kind of madman would
do something like this?

1024
01:13:39.656 --> 01:13:42.797
That's a poor poochie.

1025
01:13:42.901 --> 01:13:47.112
That's a baby.
That's a baby.

1026
01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:56.190
Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm
are gone! They left this.

1027
01:13:56.293 --> 01:13:59.055
- It's a note.
- "If you want to see your kids again,

1028
01:13:59.158 --> 01:14:02.955
bring the dictabird to the quarry
at dawn. No police." -

1029
01:14:18.384 --> 01:14:20.421
Mr. Flintstone...

1030
01:14:20.525 --> 01:14:23.873
Stealing office equipment.
Really. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1031
01:14:23.976 --> 01:14:27.980
Is this the kind of example you
want to set for your daughter?

1032
01:14:28.084 --> 01:14:30.776
- Where are the kids?
- The bird, please.

1033
01:14:32.951 --> 01:14:35.747
- First, we want our children.
- Of course.

1034
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:40.993
Bamm-Bamm!

1035
01:14:41.097 --> 01:14:46.516
Take one more step, Mr. Rubble, and this quarry's
safety record will be severely tarnished.

1036
01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.967
Now, give me the bird.

1037
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:51.832
Go on, Fred.
Give him what he wants.

1038
01:14:51.935 --> 01:14:54.766
What? Don't worry.
I got a plan.

1039
01:14:54.869 --> 01:14:59.080
- We're gonna get the kids back, and then
we'll rescue you. - What a strategist.

1040
01:15:01.945 --> 01:15:04.016
I should have signed
with Disney.

1041
01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.985
They never would've allowed this
sort of thing to happen.

1042
01:15:11.368 --> 01:15:12.542
Ah! Easy.

1043
01:15:12.646 --> 01:15:14.579
Thank you, gentlemen.

1044
01:15:14.682 --> 01:15:16.995
And in the words of
my beloved mother,

1045
01:15:17.098 --> 01:15:20.964
I'm taking the money and
moving to a warmer climate.

1046
01:15:28.903 --> 01:15:31.147
Help, Daddy!

1047
01:15:37.671 --> 01:15:40.121
Let's discuss this,
shall we, Cliff? May I call you Cliff?

1048
01:15:40.225 --> 01:15:42.710
Barney, too much pressure.

1049
01:15:51.167 --> 01:15:54.273
One, two, three...

1050
01:15:56.379 --> 01:15:58.243
Nice goin'.

1051
01:15:58.346 --> 01:16:01.833
Now what do we do? You get the kids,
I'll try and stop this.

1052
01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.031
Whoa!

1053
01:16:37.489 --> 01:16:41.286
Cliffy, have I ever told you you
have a very distinguished chin?

1054
01:16:41.389 --> 01:16:44.116
Shut up!

1055
01:16:48.465 --> 01:16:49.777
Whoa!

1056
01:16:50.847 --> 01:16:54.368
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1057
01:16:57.371 --> 01:16:59.062
Oh!

1058
01:16:59.166 --> 01:17:03.135
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Too many years
behind a desk. Mayday, Mayday!

1059
01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:10.971
Hi, Dada.

1060
01:17:11.074 --> 01:17:14.250
You did it!
You called me dada!

1061
01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:18.392
Oh, Barney, you lunkhead!

1062
01:17:30.818 --> 01:17:34.650
What am I gonna do?
I gotta think of somethin'.

1063
01:17:38.515 --> 01:17:40.725
Not now.

1064
01:17:48.284 --> 01:17:50.286
Wake up,
Uncle Barney!

1065
01:17:53.634 --> 01:17:55.774
Help, help!

1066
01:17:55.878 --> 01:17:59.502
Save me!
Save me from this mad M.B.A.!

1067
01:17:59.605 --> 01:18:03.886
- Don't worry. I'll take care of him.
- My hero.

1068
01:18:06.336 --> 01:18:08.407
Yipes.

1069
01:18:08.511 --> 01:18:11.859
Flintstone,
kiss your bird good-bye.

1070
01:18:14.137 --> 01:18:16.001
Oh, mama.

1071
01:18:22.007 --> 01:18:24.251
Will there be anything
else, Mr. Flintstone?

1072
01:18:24.354 --> 01:18:26.909
No, Miss Stone.
Take the rest of the day off.

1073
01:19:00.977 --> 01:19:05.395
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1074
01:19:09.537 --> 01:19:11.263
Cliff.

1075
01:19:11.367 --> 01:19:14.542
It's time for you and me
to interface.

1076
01:19:30.455 --> 01:19:33.941
- Aah!
- Stee-rike!

1077
01:19:54.962 --> 01:19:56.895
And then Cliff said,

1078
01:19:56.999 --> 01:20:00.381
"True. But I've graciously decided
to give you all the credit,

1079
01:20:00.485 --> 01:20:03.419
since it's your name on
all the requisition forms."

1080
01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:10.253
Mr. Flintstone,
I may not be in on Monday.

1081
01:20:10.357 --> 01:20:12.738
Don't worry, Miss Stone.
I'll tell 'em what you did.

1082
01:20:12.842 --> 01:20:16.639
I'm sure they'll
let you off easy. Well, I've been a very bad girl.

1083
01:20:16.742 --> 01:20:19.504
But you have to admit,

1084
01:20:19.607 --> 01:20:23.508
I was very,
very good at it.

1085
01:20:26.856 --> 01:20:29.376
Come on, do it for Mommy.
Who am I?

1086
01:20:29.479 --> 01:20:32.103
Bamm-Bamm! Oh.

1087
01:20:34.864 --> 01:20:37.142
Thank goodness
you're all right.

1088
01:20:37.246 --> 01:20:41.560
Well, I'm not going to jail,
but it won't be easy getting a new job.

1089
01:20:41.664 --> 01:20:44.943
What kind of reference is Mr. Slate gonna
give me after I destroyed his quarry?

1090
01:20:45.047 --> 01:20:48.291
Oh, none of this was your fault, Fred.
I'm sure Mr. Slate will understand.

1091
01:20:48.395 --> 01:20:50.846
Flintstone!

1092
01:20:50.949 --> 01:20:53.503
Sure, now he gets
my name right.

1093
01:20:53.607 --> 01:20:56.644
How did this happen?

1094
01:20:56.748 --> 01:21:00.407
Well, Mr. Slate, it all started when
the Rubbles here wanted to adopt a baby.

1095
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:03.479
Not that!

1096
01:21:03.582 --> 01:21:06.965
How did this
happen to Cliff?

1097
01:21:07.069 --> 01:21:11.867
Well, you see, Mr. Slate, the machinery went
haywire, and the rocks got all crushed up,

1098
01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:14.800
and that got mixed in with water,
and that came all down the hill.

1099
01:21:14.904 --> 01:21:17.769
Mr. Slate, I'm sorry! Sorry?

1100
01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.529
I love this stuff!

1101
01:21:19.633 --> 01:21:22.912
I'm gonna name it after
my daughter, Concretia.

1102
01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:27.917
Flintstone,
you're a genius!

1103
01:21:28.021 --> 01:21:30.920
Me? Really?
Why?

1104
01:21:31.024 --> 01:21:36.236
Don't you see? Thanks to concrete,
man can now shape his own destiny.

1105
01:21:36.339 --> 01:21:38.686
The Stone Age is over!

1106
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:42.380
First thing, I want you to hire
back all the men, Flintstone.

1107
01:21:42.483 --> 01:21:45.038
- We're going into
production immediately. - We?

1108
01:21:45.141 --> 01:21:49.456
That's right. You are hereby promoted to
President of the entire Concrete Division.

1109
01:21:49.559 --> 01:21:51.216
Yabba...

1110
01:21:57.843 --> 01:22:02.296
That's a real nice offer, Mr. Slate, but
unfortunately, I'm gonna have to turn you down.

1111
01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.956
Don't listen to him, Mr. Slate. Fred, it's a
great job. And, this time, you deserve it.

1112
01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:09.579
Barney, all my life
I wanted to be a somebody.

1113
01:22:09.683 --> 01:22:12.755
And when I finally did,
I turned into somebody I didn't like.

1114
01:22:12.858 --> 01:22:16.207
Good grief, man,
have you lost your mind?

1115
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:19.417
This could make you rich...
Rich beyond your wildest dreams.

1116
01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.282
I was always the richest
man in the world.

1117
01:22:22.385 --> 01:22:24.870
I just never knew it.

1118
01:22:24.974 --> 01:22:27.045
So, if it's okay with you,
Mr. Slate,

1119
01:22:27.149 --> 01:22:30.117
all I want is my old job
back and my old life.

1120
01:22:30.221 --> 01:22:33.534
Fred.

1121
01:22:33.638 --> 01:22:36.227
And two weeks paid vacation
for all the men in the quarry,

1122
01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:38.505
an annual
cost of livin' increase...

1123
01:22:38.608 --> 01:22:41.542
and those little packets
of ketchup in the lunchroom.

1124
01:22:41.646 --> 01:22:45.167
- Done! - Thanks,
boss. See you at the company picnic.

1125
01:22:47.341 --> 01:22:51.414
There goes the best
executive I ever had.

1126
01:22:51.518 --> 01:22:54.210
Fred, I'm so
proud of you. And I'm proud of you, Barney.

1127
01:22:54.314 --> 01:22:56.316
And I'm starving! Me too!

1128
01:22:56.419 --> 01:22:59.767
What do you say we get some breakfast.
Snake and eggs for everybody.

1129
01:22:59.871 --> 01:23:01.286
My treat.Great.

1130
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:02.908
Barney...

1131
01:23:03.012 --> 01:23:07.051
Yeah, Fred? Could you spot me a couple of
bucks? I'm a little short.

1132
01:23:09.018 --> 01:23:10.951
