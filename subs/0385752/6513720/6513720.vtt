1
00:00:40.074 --> 00:00:44.568
There are many universes
and many earths...

2
00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:46.603
parallel to each other.

3
00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:50.374
Worlds like yours...

4
00:00:50.418 --> 00:00:53.876
where people's souls
live inside their bodies...

5
00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:01.219
and worlds like mine...

6
00:01:01.262 --> 00:01:03.560
where they walk beside us...

7
00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:07.398
as animal spirits
we call daemons.

8
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.001
Are we going to see the child?

9
00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.069
I should think so.

10
00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.343
So many worlds...

11
00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:20.609
but connecting them all is Dust.

12
00:01:20.648 --> 00:01:23.981
Dust was here before
the witches of the air...

13
00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:27.044
the Gyptians of the water...

14
00:01:27.088 --> 00:01:29.579
and the bears of the ice.

15
00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:35.451
In my world,
scholars invented an alethiometer...

16
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:39.529
a golden compass...

17
00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:42.502
and it showed them
all that was hidden.

18
00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:48.334
But the ruling power, fearing
any truth but their own...

19
00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:51.243
destroyed these devices...

20
00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:55.544
and forbade
the very mention of Dust.

21
00:01:55.583 --> 00:01:58.950
One compass remains, however...

22
00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:01.750
and only one who can read it.

23
00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:03.488
You'll never get me!

24
00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.952
Let's go get 'em, Lyra.

25
00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:10.728
Come on!

26
00:02:10.765 --> 00:02:12.096
Gonna get you!

27
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.067
I'll get you first!

28
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:15.762
Billy!

29
00:02:15.803 --> 00:02:17.771
You come back here!

30
00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:19.204
Leave me alone!

31
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.537
Faster, faster!

32
00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:22.303
We're gonna get you!

33
00:02:22.343 --> 00:02:24.072
Run, Roger!

34
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:27.805
You are now Gobbled!

35
00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:31.477
You've gotta do whatever I say!

36
00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:35.255
Go, Roger! Run!

37
00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:39.459
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

38
00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:42.326
- Leave us alone!
- Get him!

39
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.292
Come on. Run!

40
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.100
Hurry up, Roger,
or they'll Gobble you!

41
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.334
Faster!

42
00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:01.606
Hurry up!

43
00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:03.947
Stop!

44
00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:07.943
If you value your lives,
come no further.

45
00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:09.182
Why?

46
00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:10.986
We Gobbled him fair and square.

47
00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:13.493
This ain't no game, Billy Costa.

48
00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.427
Don't you know what this gate is?

49
00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:17.761
It's the back door
to your stupid college.

50
00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:18.787
So?

51
00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:21.301
There's a curse on this gate.

52
00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:23.997
You Gyptians ought to know that.

53
00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:25.198
Crossin' this gate...

54
00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.799
is worse than touching
someone's daemon...

55
00:03:27.842 --> 00:03:29.173
with your bare hands.

56
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.542
Why ain't nothin'
happened to you, then?

57
00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.376
'Cause we live 'ere.

58
00:03:33.414 --> 00:03:35.507
We got safe passage, see?

59
00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.074
And anyway, my mother's
the one who put the curse...

60
00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:39.780
on this gate in the first place.

61
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.151
What mother?

62
00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:42.883
I heard you was an orphink...

63
00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:46.120
and your uncle only left you 'ere
'cause nobody wanted you.

64
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.684
Come 'ere and say that.

65
00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.394
Don't, Billy.

66
00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.197
You should listen to your mate.

67
00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:57.864
The scholars got this special room
where they deal with trespassers.

68
00:03:57.905 --> 00:03:59.930
They got this poison gown, right...

69
00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:01.874
and it burns you alive!

70
00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.810
Rubbish. Hand him over.

71
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.481
It ain't rubbish.
I'll prove it. I'll steal it.

72
00:04:09.517 --> 00:04:11.178
You can have Roger.

73
00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:13.743
As long as you try it on.

74
00:04:13.788 --> 00:04:16.689
All right. Bring it with you tonight.

75
00:04:16.724 --> 00:04:17.986
Or else...

76
00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:20.450
War.

77
00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:23.363
Billy, don't!

78
00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:26.560
See ya later, then.

79
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.500
OK.

80
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.995
Well done, Billy!

81
00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.064
You ain't really gonna
hand me over to them?

82
00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:35.575
Of course not.

83
00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.372
I'll steal any old scholar's gown.

84
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:39.345
He'll never try it on anyway.

85
00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:48.254
- Lord Asriel?
- Morning, Hunt.

86
00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.883
Well, the Master will be relieved
to hear you've arrived safely.

87
00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:52.449
I'm sure he will.

88
00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:28.126
I wish you'd listen
to me once in a while.

89
00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:30.062
Stop being such a coward.

90
00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:32.497
If I weren't such a coward,
where would you be?

91
00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:35.502
In the Retiring Room already.

92
00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:43.307
Come on, quick.

93
00:05:48.616 --> 00:05:50.846
Let's find a robe
and get out of here.

94
00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:55.118
Don't be silly.
I want to look around.

95
00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.919
You do know that if you get
a smack, I hurt too?

96
00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:05.194
Oh, Lyra.

97
00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:07.826
You're gonna get us caught.

98
00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:14.369
Oh, no! I told you!

99
00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:20.072
Lord Asriel is an eminent
fellow of the college.

100
00:06:20.114 --> 00:06:24.107
And as master of Jordan,
you must force him...

101
00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:26.016
to abandon his plan.

102
00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:28.487
They're talking about Uncle Asriel.

103
00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:31.150
I speak for the Magisterium.

104
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:34.558
The Magisterium has no authority
within these walls.

105
00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:37.393
My dear fellow...

106
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:40.730
the Magisterium
has authority everywhere...

107
00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:45.234
and Lord Asriel will be silenced...

108
00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:48.264
one way or another.

109
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:50.402
That may be.

110
00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:53.345
But while he is at Jordan,
his proposal will be heard.

111
00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:58.407
I'll not dispense with centuries
of tolerance and free inquiry.

112
00:06:58.452 --> 00:07:00.420
And that's my final word
on the matter.

113
00:07:01.422 --> 00:07:03.413
Now, if you'll excuse me...

114
00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.563
I shall call the Council to order.

115
00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:18.570
I guess we lost that bet.

116
00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.073
Hush, pan.

117
00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:48.658
Lyra, he's leaving. Let's go.

118
00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:49.691
Lyra.

119
00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:54.901
- The professor... a really hard time.
- Oh, no.

120
00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:57.737
It's Stelmaria.

121
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:05.479
The master asked me to decant a bottle
of the '99 Tokay for you, Lord Asriel.

122
00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.487
He remembered
you were partial to it.

123
00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:09.346
Thank you.

124
00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:30.139
- Lyra!
- It's poisoned.

125
00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:32.304
- Nonsense.
- It ain't nonsense.

126
00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:34.576
I saw that man
from the Magisterium...

127
00:08:34.615 --> 00:08:36.583
pour some powder into the wine.

128
00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:42.479
Go back in there.

129
00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:44.081
Keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

130
00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:46.058
Go on.

131
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:57.368
Ah, Lord Asriel.

132
00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:58.894
This is a rare pleasure.

133
00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:04.138
May I introduce
Fra pavel of the Magisterium?

134
00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:09.878
We've never met, but I've followed
your exploits closely, Lord Asriel.

135
00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:11.544
That's what the smell is.

136
00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:14.053
Master, gentlemen,
I shall get straight to the point.

137
00:09:14.088 --> 00:09:15.715
Hunt, the lights.

138
00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:21.357
This photogram was taken
at the magnetic North pole...

139
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.364
in Svalbard...

140
00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:28.958
kingdom of the ice bears.

141
00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:30.902
Ice bears, pan.

142
00:09:30.938 --> 00:09:35.034
Lord Asriel, is that light rising up
from the man's body or coming down?

143
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:38.135
No, that's coming down from the sky,
but that's not light.

144
00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:43.582
- It's Dust.
- Dust?

145
00:09:48.489 --> 00:09:50.980
- What's Dust?
- I don't know.

146
00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:52.514
It can't be the normal sort.

147
00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:54.925
They've got plenty of that here.

148
00:09:54.962 --> 00:09:56.793
Mirabile dictu, gentlemen.

149
00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.095
Allow Lord Asriel to explain.

150
00:10:00.134 --> 00:10:03.729
Perhaps you've made a mistake.

151
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.206
It could be an aberration
or malfunction of some kind.

152
00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:10.108
No, it is no aberration.

153
00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:14.745
The behavior of these particles
is quite unmistakable.

154
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:19.377
Dust is flowing into this man,
through his daemon...

155
00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:22.115
from a city in another world.

156
00:10:22.156 --> 00:10:26.115
A world much like ours in a parallel
universe coexisting with our own.

157
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.357
Invisible, intangible, inaccessible!

158
00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:30.420
Until now.

159
00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:34.195
From there, and from
a billion other worlds, Dust flows.

160
00:10:34.234 --> 00:10:36.930
Worlds of infinite possibilities.

161
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.562
Some where men have no daemons.

162
00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:40.300
Some where daemons have no men.

163
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.934
People without daemons.
That's impossible.

164
00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.638
And even some where
there is no Magisterium...

165
00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:49.575
and no Authority.

166
00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:52.075
That is heresy.

167
00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:53.984
That...

168
00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:57.590
is the truth.

169
00:10:57.624 --> 00:11:02.118
I wouldn't recommend the Tokay,
gentlemen. It's corked.

170
00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:05.325
To discover the source of Dust,
I intend to travel to these worlds.

171
00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.833
With a sufficient source
of energy and...

172
00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:09.995
Well, a sufficient source of funds...

173
00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:13.436
I can effect a crossing.

174
00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:16.442
I humbly beg the College Council
to fund such a journey.

175
00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:25.177
It wasn't my fault.
She wouldn't listen to me.

176
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.349
I will not have my niece
slithering round like an alley cat.

177
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.359
You're not very grateful, are you?

178
00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:35.122
I've just saved your life.

179
00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:40.128
Uncle, why did he try
to poison you?

180
00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:41.828
- You wouldn't understand.
- Yes, I would.

181
00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.768
Well, I don't see why.

182
00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:45.829
Apparently you're
impossible to educate.

183
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:47.601
A miscreant and a liar.

184
00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:52.805
What will the Magisterium
do to you now?

185
00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:55.474
The Magisterium's days
are numbered.

186
00:11:55.515 --> 00:11:57.244
What does that mean?

187
00:11:57.284 --> 00:11:59.548
Trouble, with a bit of luck.

188
00:12:00.921 --> 00:12:02.821
Did you get the money you needed?

189
00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:04.289
Are you going North again?

190
00:12:04.324 --> 00:12:07.054
The College Council
has defied the Magisterium.

191
00:12:07.094 --> 00:12:09.028
I'm leaving immediately.

192
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.552
Can I come with you?

193
00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:12.428
I want to see the ice bears
and glaciers...

194
00:12:12.466 --> 00:12:14.127
and learn about Dust
and everything.

195
00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:16.294
What do you know about Dust?

196
00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:17.860
- Nothing.
- Good.

197
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.235
Keep it that way.

198
00:12:19.273 --> 00:12:21.537
Now be a good girl
and do what you're told.

199
00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:23.372
But you don't do what you're told.

200
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.435
You don't let anybody
tell you what to do.

201
00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.310
Yes, and look at the welcome I got.

202
00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:32.818
Hush, pan.

203
00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:34.980
I see your daemon
still changes shape.

204
00:12:35.022 --> 00:12:36.887
Hasn't settled yet.

205
00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:38.413
Yeah.

206
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.051
That's to do with Dust, isn't it?

207
00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.030
Why kids' daemons
can change shape...

208
00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:46.930
but grown-ups' daemons can't.

209
00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:50.029
Lyra.

210
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.163
Dust is none of your business.

211
00:12:53.573 --> 00:12:55.541
Now you try and behave.

212
00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:14.892
My Uncle Asriel said he'd take me
to the North next time he goes. He swore it.

213
00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:16.486
'Cause he needs my help, see.

214
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.861
What for?

215
00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:20.730
Fightin', probably.

216
00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:22.359
Or spying.

217
00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:24.370
He uses me as a spy sometimes.

218
00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:26.338
Like now, for instance.

219
00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:28.307
I'm supposed to be keeping
an eye on them Gobblers...

220
00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:29.331
Come on!

221
00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:31.776
...'cause they took them
Gyptian kids up Banbury way.

222
00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:33.245
Billy Costa told me.

223
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.408
I heard them Gobblers
take you down to hell.

224
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.418
Course they don't.

225
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.651
You're afraid of them, ain't you?

226
00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:42.780
No, I ain't.

227
00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:49.126
But the adults are,
because kids keep disappearin'.

228
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.426
They go after the poor kids, see.

229
00:13:51.465 --> 00:13:55.401
The orphans
and the servant kids as well.

230
00:13:55.435 --> 00:13:58.029
Roger, I promise...

231
00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:00.665
if you was taken by the Gobblers...

232
00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:01.969
I'd come and rescue you.

233
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.801
You'd come and get me too,
wouldn't you?

234
00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:09.612
Course. But everybody would go
looking for you if you was Gobbled.

235
00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:11.810
- You're a lady.
- Says who?

236
00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:16.152
Cook. He says that's why your uncle
left you here, to make you a lady.

237
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.986
Nobody can make me a lady.

238
00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:21.858
Not the master and scholars
and porters combined, right?

239
00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:25.194
Take it back, or we ain't
best mates no more!

240
00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:27.132
All right, all right,
you ain't a lady.

241
00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:28.862
Lyra!

242
00:14:28.902 --> 00:14:32.269
Lyra Belacqua,
get down off them roofs!

243
00:14:32.305 --> 00:14:33.863
The Master wants you at high table!

244
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.445
It was really...
really quite surprising.

245
00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:41.674
The state of your knees.

246
00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.842
And your hair.

247
00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:44.873
Well...

248
00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:47.684
It's not surprising.

249
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.519
Roger and me's
been huntin' Gobblers.

250
00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.286
It's dirty work.

251
00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:55.726
'Ere, don't you make jokes
about them Gobblers.

252
00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:58.560
Ain't nothin' to play about
when children go missing.

253
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.573
Lyra, my dear...

254
00:15:11.611 --> 00:15:15.206
the tutor of metaphysics tells me
that you've missed your lesson again.

255
00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:19.184
Now, I know you do not always
understand our need to educate you...

256
00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:23.553
but sometimes you must do
what others think... best.

257
00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.419
But I disagree, Master.

258
00:15:27.994 --> 00:15:28.983
Mrs. Coulter.

259
00:15:31.665 --> 00:15:33.064
When I was a young woman...

260
00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:36.159
I knew that no one could ever
really truly understand me...

261
00:15:36.203 --> 00:15:38.364
except, of course, my daemon...

262
00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:41.431
and that it would be best
if we were free to do as we pleased.

263
00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:48.404
Sit down, gentlemen.

264
00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:51.007
- Who's she?
- Don't know.

265
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:53.383
But she shut up the Master, all right.

266
00:15:53.420 --> 00:16:00.053
Mrs. Coulter? This is our Lyra,
Lyra Belacqua, Lord Asriel's niece.

267
00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:02.561
Lyra, this is Mrs. Coulter...

268
00:16:02.596 --> 00:16:04.860
a friend of the college.

269
00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:09.432
Lovely to meet you.

270
00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.302
Lovely to meet you too.

271
00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:15.331
Do you know I've met Lord Asriel?

272
00:16:15.942 --> 00:16:18.240
It was at the Royal Arctic Institute.

273
00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:20.813
We discussed
the political structure...

274
00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:23.213
of the ice bears of Svalbard.

275
00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:25.982
You've seen an ice bear?

276
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.014
As a matter of fact...

277
00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:30.716
I have had an audience
with the bear king himself...

278
00:16:30.757 --> 00:16:32.281
Ragnar Sturlusson.

279
00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.919
And I'll tell you something
I probably shouldn't...

280
00:16:36.396 --> 00:16:39.957
King Ragnar is desperate
to have a daemon of his own.

281
00:16:42.202 --> 00:16:45.103
Bears don't have them, you see,
and Ragnar...

282
00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:47.629
he likes to think of himself
as a person...

283
00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:50.472
and he will stop at nothing to get one.

284
00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.104
But you mustn't repeat that.

285
00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:55.842
Oh, I'd never.

286
00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:01.180
You know, I feel I can trust you.

287
00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:08.359
I have to go back
to the North very soon.

288
00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:10.363
I'm going to need an assistant.

289
00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:13.332
Me?

290
00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.357
- Go to the North?
- North?

291
00:17:15.402 --> 00:17:16.926
It's cold up there.

292
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.438
We'd better get
the Master's permission.

293
00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:24.169
Master, I was wondering...

294
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.701
if I might borrow dear Lyra.

295
00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:30.406
Only for a while, of course.

296
00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:33.710
I'm not sure
that would be consistent with...

297
00:17:33.753 --> 00:17:36.278
Lord Asriel's wishes
for her education.

298
00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:41.052
Let me deal with Asriel.

299
00:17:41.094 --> 00:17:44.495
You mustn't deny me
this little thing, you really mustn't.

300
00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.506
Very well.

301
00:17:57.978 --> 00:17:59.969
Yeah...

302
00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:03.339
Yeah...

303
00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:12.055
A bet's a bet...

304
00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:14.822
and Lyra was supposed
to show up with the gown.

305
00:18:14.861 --> 00:18:17.227
I told you they wouldn't
let her out of the college.

306
00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:18.821
Which one's her room?

307
00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:20.389
What are you gonna do?

308
00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:22.264
Give her a fright, that's all.

309
00:18:22.302 --> 00:18:25.032
We get caught,
I'll be skinned alive.

310
00:18:25.071 --> 00:18:28.063
Night porter's bound
to be doin' his rounds.

311
00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:30.235
Ratter, check if the coast is clear.

312
00:18:43.423 --> 00:18:44.856
It's all clear.

313
00:18:48.495 --> 00:18:51.020
Billy! Billy!

314
00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:04.608
The scholars still refuse
to hand over the last alethiometer...

315
00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:08.808
and now they've given Asriel
all the funds he needs.

316
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:13.176
If he succeeds in proving
the existence of these other worlds...

317
00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:17.053
it will contradict
centuries of teaching.

318
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:21.254
There will always be
freethinkers and heretics...

319
00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:26.061
unless we deal
with the root of the problem.

320
00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:28.932
That is why Mrs. Coulter's work
is so important.

321
00:19:30.937 --> 00:19:32.598
What progress has she made?

322
00:19:32.639 --> 00:19:35.733
The doctors at Bolvangar...

323
00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:38.903
are close to perfecting
the inoculation...

324
00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:42.904
against the effects of Dust.

325
00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:46.146
I am relieved to hear that.

326
00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:50.384
If we can protect our children
from the corrupting influence of Dust...

327
00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:53.153
before their daemons settle...

328
00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:57.391
then we will nurture a generation
at peace with itself...

329
00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:01.196
one that will never question
our authority again.

330
00:20:02.936 --> 00:20:05.336
We owe it to the young...

331
00:20:06.506 --> 00:20:08.201
do we not?

332
00:20:11.945 --> 00:20:14.641
I fear our defiance
will not go unpunished...

333
00:20:18.852 --> 00:20:21.446
now she'll be drawn into it.

334
00:20:21.488 --> 00:20:22.512
We've failed her.

335
00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:27.015
We've protected her
as long as we could, Master.

336
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.584
And she's still only a child.

337
00:20:28.628 --> 00:20:30.459
She can't possibly be
a threat to them.

338
00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:32.362
She is.

339
00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:35.959
She's meant to play
a major part in what is to come.

340
00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:39.302
How can you know such things?

341
00:20:41.374 --> 00:20:43.001
The witches.

342
00:20:48.214 --> 00:20:49.545
Thank you. Could you...

343
00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:52.483
Could you stay
by the door, Mrs. Lonsdale?

344
00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:55.044
It's important that I know
if I was followed.

345
00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:57.056
Why yes, Master.

346
00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:05.423
It's for you, Lyra.

347
00:21:05.465 --> 00:21:06.932
What is this?

348
00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:08.900
An alethiometer.

349
00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:13.065
Also known as a golden compass.

350
00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:19.939
It was given to the college
by Lord Asriel many years ago.

351
00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:23.415
And now I'm giving it to you.

352
00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:26.350
I feel you are meant to have it.

353
00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:28.650
What's it for?

354
00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:33.585
It tells the truth.

355
00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.992
We've always tried
to acquaint you with the truth.

356
00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:38.998
But the secrets at the heart
of things elude scholars...

357
00:21:39.032 --> 00:21:41.125
and, uh, Authorities.

358
00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:44.933
But this lets you
glimpse things as they are.

359
00:21:46.406 --> 00:21:50.172
But, Lyra,
keep the alethiometer to yourself.

360
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.507
It is of the utmost importance...

361
00:21:51.544 --> 00:21:53.944
that Mrs. Coulter
does not know that you have it.

362
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.004
Do you understand me?

363
00:21:55.048 --> 00:21:57.039
Of the utmost importance.

364
00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:04.987
Lyra. Are you ready?

365
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.327
There's someone missing.

366
00:22:08.361 --> 00:22:10.488
I want to say goodbye to Roger.

367
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:14.125
Roger? Who's Roger?

368
00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:16.727
My friend.
He works in the kitchens.

369
00:22:17.971 --> 00:22:20.633
We must go.
The ferry's about to take off.

370
00:22:22.308 --> 00:22:23.969
Why don't you write him a letter?

371
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.205
You can tell him
all about the journey, and...

372
00:22:26.246 --> 00:22:27.873
you can even send him a photogram.

373
00:22:27.914 --> 00:22:29.040
- Madam.
- What do you think?

374
00:22:29.082 --> 00:22:31.209
Yeah. I suppose.

375
00:23:02.815 --> 00:23:05.409
- Anything else, madam?
- That'll be all.

376
00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:11.153
Mrs. Coulter, what's that?

377
00:23:12.625 --> 00:23:15.992
That is the Magisterial seat, Lyra.

378
00:23:17.931 --> 00:23:20.491
What's the Magisterium for?

379
00:23:20.533 --> 00:23:23.696
Oh, you have been living
in an ivory tower, haven't you?

380
00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:27.103
The Magisterium
is what people need.

381
00:23:28.474 --> 00:23:32.205
They keep things working
by telling people what to do.

382
00:23:32.245 --> 00:23:36.238
But... you told the Master
you did whatever you pleased.

383
00:23:38.384 --> 00:23:41.444
That's right. Clever girl.

384
00:23:41.487 --> 00:23:45.048
Well, some people know
what's best for them...

385
00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:46.558
and some people don't.

386
00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.319
Besides, they don't tell
people what to do...

387
00:23:49.362 --> 00:23:50.624
in a mean, petty way...

388
00:23:50.663 --> 00:23:52.927
they tell them what
to do in a kindly way...

389
00:23:52.966 --> 00:23:55.434
to keep them out of danger.

390
00:23:56.936 --> 00:23:58.233
Sugar?

391
00:24:53.926 --> 00:24:59.057
Look, pan, it's got
loads of pictures round the edge.

392
00:24:59.098 --> 00:25:00.793
But what do they all mean?

393
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:02.664
Don't know.

394
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.666
The needle keeps stopping
at the same symbols...

395
00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:10.539
Lady...

396
00:25:10.576 --> 00:25:12.407
lightning bolt...

397
00:25:12.445 --> 00:25:14.572
and the baby.

398
00:25:14.614 --> 00:25:17.913
Then it goes back
and does it again. See?

399
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.646
What do you think
makes the needle move?

400
00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:24.053
I don't know.
Maybe Uncle Asriel knows.

401
00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:28.719
Maybe we're supposed
to take it to him.

402
00:25:33.466 --> 00:25:35.400
All washed and ready for bed?

403
00:25:37.403 --> 00:25:39.166
We have a busy few weeks.

404
00:25:57.156 --> 00:26:00.284
Well, it was
a stylish enough party...

405
00:26:00.326 --> 00:26:02.851
but why they don't offer
more ice with their drinks...

406
00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:04.760
I shall never understand.

407
00:26:04.797 --> 00:26:07.095
I'll only be a moment, darling.

408
00:26:07.133 --> 00:26:08.623
Official business.

409
00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:13.965
What?

410
00:26:14.006 --> 00:26:17.271
She likes to show off
her new pet, doesn't she?

411
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.870
She's never taking us to the North.

412
00:26:19.912 --> 00:26:21.504
We're like prisoners in this house.

413
00:26:21.547 --> 00:26:24.607
All these rules, and rooms
that we aren't allowed into.

414
00:26:27.687 --> 00:26:31.088
Perhaps we shouldn't have
invited professor Docker.

415
00:26:31.124 --> 00:26:32.955
He's such a bore, isn't he?

416
00:26:32.992 --> 00:26:34.960
And he had sauce in his beard.

417
00:26:38.464 --> 00:26:42.161
But he is one of the foremost
experts on particle metaphysics.

418
00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:45.699
Have I taught you
what a particle is?

419
00:26:45.738 --> 00:26:47.933
Oh, I know about particles.

420
00:26:47.974 --> 00:26:49.134
Like Dust.

421
00:26:49.842 --> 00:26:51.434
That's a particle, isn't it?

422
00:26:52.612 --> 00:26:54.079
Dust?

423
00:26:54.113 --> 00:26:56.240
I mean the Dust from space.

424
00:26:56.282 --> 00:26:58.512
That Dust, like in the North.

425
00:26:58.551 --> 00:27:00.416
Where did you hear about that?

426
00:27:02.188 --> 00:27:04.247
It must have been
one of the scholars at Jordan.

427
00:27:09.829 --> 00:27:11.524
A wise person knows, Lyra...

428
00:27:11.564 --> 00:27:13.759
that there are some things
that we best ignore...

429
00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:17.792
subjects that you...
well, you never speak about.

430
00:27:19.205 --> 00:27:21.366
- But I didn't...
- Yes.

431
00:27:21.407 --> 00:27:24.308
You didn't know, so I forgive you.

432
00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:26.106
Just don't mention it again.

433
00:27:28.147 --> 00:27:29.614
Now, darling...

434
00:27:29.649 --> 00:27:32.777
will you take off that
childish shoulder bag?

435
00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:35.252
I don't like to see you
wearing it indoors.

436
00:27:37.623 --> 00:27:39.488
Please, Mrs. Coulter.

437
00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:42.016
I do love it.

438
00:27:42.795 --> 00:27:44.285
But I do not.

439
00:27:47.967 --> 00:27:49.662
Put it away.

440
00:27:53.706 --> 00:27:55.833
Lyra, put it away now.

441
00:27:55.875 --> 00:27:57.467
I don't want to.

442
00:27:58.945 --> 00:28:00.674
If you do not obey me...

443
00:28:00.713 --> 00:28:02.408
we will have an argument
which I will win.

444
00:28:02.448 --> 00:28:04.348
Now put it away at once.

445
00:28:04.383 --> 00:28:07.079
It's absurd to be carrying
around a shoulder bag...

446
00:28:07.119 --> 00:28:09.087
in your own home.

447
00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:10.986
Jordan is my home.

448
00:28:13.359 --> 00:28:15.088
No! Lyra!

449
00:28:16.395 --> 00:28:18.886
Don't. Please, it hurts!

450
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:20.193
Lyra!

451
00:28:21.234 --> 00:28:22.360
Lyra!

452
00:28:22.401 --> 00:28:23.891
Will you do as I tell you?

453
00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:25.198
I promise.

454
00:28:29.742 --> 00:28:31.300
Lyra.

455
00:28:32.778 --> 00:28:34.575
Thank you.

456
00:28:36.482 --> 00:28:38.746
And while you're at it, you must
learn to control your daemon.

457
00:28:38.784 --> 00:28:40.615
He's much too wild.

458
00:28:40.653 --> 00:28:42.883
Now...

459
00:28:42.922 --> 00:28:45.015
Kiss me.

460
00:28:48.261 --> 00:28:49.455
I hate her!

461
00:28:50.997 --> 00:28:52.897
I hate them!

462
00:28:52.932 --> 00:28:54.297
And look.

463
00:28:54.333 --> 00:28:56.130
They're spying on us.

464
00:29:01.807 --> 00:29:04.037
What do they want with us?

465
00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:06.044
Why are we here?

466
00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:07.602
Did you see her daemon?

467
00:29:07.647 --> 00:29:10.241
He went all sharp
when you mentioned Dust.

468
00:29:10.283 --> 00:29:12.649
And what does she keep
in that room?

469
00:29:12.685 --> 00:29:14.346
Let's go find out.

470
00:29:30.069 --> 00:29:32.663
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

471
00:29:39.145 --> 00:29:40.874
Over here.

472
00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:51.779
Look.

473
00:29:57.096 --> 00:29:59.496
That's just one of
her stupid guest lists.

474
00:29:59.532 --> 00:30:00.863
No, it isn't.

475
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.595
Look at it.

476
00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.505
"Inter... cision."

477
00:30:10.376 --> 00:30:12.469
What does it mean, pan?

478
00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:13.500
And that...

479
00:30:13.546 --> 00:30:16.982
"General... Oblation Board."

480
00:30:17.016 --> 00:30:19.610
G... O... B.

481
00:30:21.187 --> 00:30:23.087
Gobblers.

482
00:30:23.122 --> 00:30:26.250
From the letters, G... O... B.

483
00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:32.559
"Workman, Edwards, parslow, Costa!"

484
00:30:32.598 --> 00:30:34.065
Billy and Roger!

485
00:30:37.169 --> 00:30:39.660
Pan, it's her.
She's running the Gobblers.

486
00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:41.229
Lyra, where are you?

487
00:30:41.273 --> 00:30:42.900
We have to get out of here.

488
00:30:45.378 --> 00:30:47.175
Lyr...

489
00:30:47.213 --> 00:30:48.544
Lyra.

490
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:50.048
What have you been doing?

491
00:30:50.082 --> 00:30:51.208
Nothing.

492
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.047
Well, we must find
something for you to do.

493
00:30:53.085 --> 00:30:56.054
Shall you help me
arrange our passage to Norroway?

494
00:30:58.057 --> 00:31:01.493
Oh, you do want to come
to the North with me, don't you?

495
00:31:01.527 --> 00:31:03.688
Where is he? I don't see him.

496
00:31:13.906 --> 00:31:16.101
Lyra, this way!

497
00:31:17.643 --> 00:31:19.668
Quick, Lyra!

498
00:31:23.916 --> 00:31:24.940
Lyra!

499
00:31:32.658 --> 00:31:34.888
What are we gonna do, pan?

500
00:31:34.927 --> 00:31:37.896
We've got to save Roger...
and Billy.

501
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.795
We've got
to save ourselves first!

502
00:31:39.832 --> 00:31:41.026
Where are we gonna go?

503
00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:42.931
Anywhere's better than here.

504
00:31:44.303 --> 00:31:46.931
Come on! This way!

505
00:31:51.544 --> 00:31:53.910
All right, then.
Split up. The girl can't be far.

506
00:31:55.181 --> 00:31:56.739
Spread out.
Search all the buildings.

507
00:31:56.782 --> 00:31:57.908
Gobblers!

508
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:59.850
You, cover the canal.

509
00:32:01.787 --> 00:32:03.982
She's gotta be here somewhere.

510
00:32:12.798 --> 00:32:14.265
Wait up, Johnny!

511
00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.131
Put your back into it!

512
00:32:16.168 --> 00:32:17.294
We'll need two more of them.

513
00:32:18.637 --> 00:32:22.266
Come on, lovely, lovely
and fresh. Lovely and fresh.

514
00:32:22.308 --> 00:32:25.800
Hurry!

515
00:32:29.448 --> 00:32:30.915
Get her!

516
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:32.178
Get it!

517
00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:37.345
Pan!

518
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:39.084
Hurry, Lyra!

519
00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:47.890
Lyra!

520
00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:49.122
Hold her!

521
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.103
No!

522
00:33:06.085 --> 00:33:08.918
- Lyra!
- Pan.

523
00:33:08.954 --> 00:33:10.945
Gyptians.

524
00:33:15.628 --> 00:33:17.357
Don't fret none, Lyra.

525
00:33:18.597 --> 00:33:19.825
Come 'ere.

526
00:33:22.268 --> 00:33:24.259
You're safe with us.

527
00:33:24.303 --> 00:33:26.601
You're Ma Costa.

528
00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:27.697
Billy's mum.

529
00:33:29.275 --> 00:33:30.708
But what are you doing here?

530
00:33:30.743 --> 00:33:32.074
We been in your shadow...

531
00:33:32.111 --> 00:33:35.376
ever since you left
Jordan College, watchin' over you.

532
00:33:35.414 --> 00:33:37.905
And a good thing too.

533
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.975
You best come with us.

534
00:33:41.186 --> 00:33:41.353
Hurry, lads.

535
00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:42.411
Hurry, lads.

536
00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:44.012
Where are we going?

537
00:33:44.056 --> 00:33:46.786
To see Lord Faa,
King of the Gyptians.

538
00:33:46.825 --> 00:33:49.055
Come on, get yourself aboard.

539
00:34:35.307 --> 00:34:37.537
Not very friendly, are they?

540
00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:39.373
What are you lookin' at?

541
00:34:45.217 --> 00:34:46.878
So now all the clans are here...

542
00:34:46.919 --> 00:34:49.649
we'll head North on the next tide.

543
00:34:51.457 --> 00:34:52.583
Ma Costa.

544
00:34:54.326 --> 00:34:56.590
This is the child?

545
00:34:58.597 --> 00:35:00.997
It's all right.

546
00:35:04.903 --> 00:35:06.268
How do you do, Lord Faa?

547
00:35:09.875 --> 00:35:11.638
Hello, Lyra.

548
00:35:13.145 --> 00:35:14.942
You come and sit by my side.

549
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.038
Right, boys, get your heads up!

550
00:35:17.216 --> 00:35:19.377
This is Farder Coram.

551
00:35:19.418 --> 00:35:21.409
Head for the ice lake!

552
00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:25.412
And these are the chiefs
of the Gyptian families.

553
00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:28.915
You are our guest here,
and you're under our protection.

554
00:35:29.828 --> 00:35:31.125
Lord Faa...

555
00:35:32.231 --> 00:35:33.630
I want to thank you.

556
00:35:33.666 --> 00:35:36.396
For keeping watch on me and all.

557
00:35:36.435 --> 00:35:38.733
But why did you do it?

558
00:35:38.771 --> 00:35:42.036
Lord Asriel has been
a good friend to the Gyptians...

559
00:35:42.074 --> 00:35:46.477
this many a year, and this many
a year it has been our charge...

560
00:35:46.512 --> 00:35:50.346
to bring him news of you
as we travel along our ways.

561
00:35:51.417 --> 00:35:53.544
Bet you didn't know that, did you?

562
00:35:54.853 --> 00:36:00.223
And when Mrs. Coulter
got a hold of you, well...

563
00:36:00.259 --> 00:36:03.558
we suspected that she had
something to do with the Gobblers.

564
00:36:03.595 --> 00:36:06.120
And she did.

565
00:36:06.165 --> 00:36:09.532
She and them Gobblers
took my little boy Billy.

566
00:36:11.003 --> 00:36:12.903
Lyra.

567
00:36:12.938 --> 00:36:15.202
We know your tale
all the way up until...

568
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.209
you run away
and the Costas found you.

569
00:36:18.243 --> 00:36:21.735
But is there anything else
you can tell us?

570
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.681
Is there anything
you may have forgot?

571
00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:27.346
Don't show it to them.

572
00:36:29.354 --> 00:36:31.788
The Master of Jordan gave me this.

573
00:36:34.159 --> 00:36:37.890
I thought they was
all taken by the Magisterium.

574
00:36:43.135 --> 00:36:45.000
It's an alethiometer.

575
00:36:45.037 --> 00:36:47.062
It's a truth measurer.

576
00:36:47.106 --> 00:36:49.506
A golden compass.

577
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:54.171
It enables you to see
what others wish to hide.

578
00:36:54.213 --> 00:36:58.115
You got three hands
you can control.

579
00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:01.608
By pointing at three symbols...

580
00:37:01.653 --> 00:37:05.282
you can ask any sort of question
you can imagine.

581
00:37:06.759 --> 00:37:08.954
Once you got your question framed...

582
00:37:08.994 --> 00:37:12.225
this blue needle points
to more symbols...

583
00:37:12.264 --> 00:37:14.198
that give you the answer.

584
00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:16.793
Could it be used
to find the missing children?

585
00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:18.359
Not by me.

586
00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:20.234
The art was jealously guarded.

587
00:37:20.272 --> 00:37:21.261
Can I try?

588
00:37:24.576 --> 00:37:25.565
All right.

589
00:37:25.611 --> 00:37:27.101
What are you doing, Lyra?

590
00:37:27.146 --> 00:37:28.443
You don't know how to read it.

591
00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.175
Hush, pan.

592
00:37:32.184 --> 00:37:37.315
Well, the serpent is cunning,
like the Gobblers.

593
00:37:37.356 --> 00:37:40.985
And... the pot could mean
a recipe or a plan.

594
00:37:41.026 --> 00:37:42.891
And...

595
00:37:42.928 --> 00:37:44.395
the baby...

596
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:46.954
that means kids.

597
00:37:46.999 --> 00:37:48.796
One thing I do know, Lyra...

598
00:37:48.834 --> 00:37:52.031
you mustn't grasp at the answer.

599
00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:55.767
Hold the question
in your mind, but lightly.

600
00:37:55.808 --> 00:37:58.402
Like it was something alive.

601
00:38:28.373 --> 00:38:30.864
It's an hourglass.

602
00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:34.106
But it came round to it
on the second time.

603
00:38:34.146 --> 00:38:37.547
The first time it only
stopped there a moment.

604
00:38:38.717 --> 00:38:41.652
On top of the hourglass...

605
00:38:41.687 --> 00:38:43.416
there's a skull.

606
00:38:49.995 --> 00:38:52.862
Thank you, children.
Finish your letters now.

607
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.533
Billy Costa,
why didn't you write anything?

608
00:39:05.577 --> 00:39:07.408
Your mother must be
missing you terribly.

609
00:39:08.947 --> 00:39:12.007
I don't know what to put
in the letter, miss.

610
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:13.881
You haven't told us
what we're here for.

611
00:39:13.919 --> 00:39:16.217
You're here to help us.

612
00:39:16.255 --> 00:39:19.850
And just as soon as you've helped us,
we'll send you back home.

613
00:39:20.859 --> 00:39:22.486
That's what you should write.

614
00:39:22.527 --> 00:39:25.087
Or don't they teach
Gyptian children to write?

615
00:39:25.898 --> 00:39:28.731
They teach us
to write the truth, miss.

616
00:39:29.768 --> 00:39:32.498
Billy, just write the letter.

617
00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:36.598
Well, as I'll be posting
these straight away...

618
00:39:36.642 --> 00:39:39.304
I'm afraid your parents
will be disappointed.

619
00:39:47.386 --> 00:39:51.584
I confess I am puzzled
by your interest in the Belacqua girl.

620
00:39:51.623 --> 00:39:55.115
For one thing, she is
in possession of the alethiometer.

621
00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.958
How...? Ah, yes. The Master.

622
00:40:01.266 --> 00:40:02.426
Can she read it?

623
00:40:02.968 --> 00:40:05.163
Of course not.

624
00:40:05.203 --> 00:40:07.137
Mrs. Coulter...

625
00:40:07.172 --> 00:40:09.868
are you familiar with
the prophesies of the witches?

626
00:40:09.908 --> 00:40:12.468
You think she is that child?

627
00:40:13.445 --> 00:40:14.434
Lmpossible.

628
00:40:15.681 --> 00:40:17.979
Nonetheless, she must be found.

629
00:40:25.857 --> 00:40:28.291
They'll seek her out
like bees to honey.

630
00:41:01.493 --> 00:41:03.085
Svalbard.

631
00:41:04.563 --> 00:41:06.360
Kingdom of the ice bears.

632
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:12.495
We shall have
to watch ourselves, Stelmaria.

633
00:41:12.537 --> 00:41:14.004
You can bet
that Coulter woman has hired...

634
00:41:14.039 --> 00:41:17.736
every Samoyed bandit from here
to the pole to hunt us down.

635
00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:27.504
Let's not be so hasty.

636
00:42:27.546 --> 00:42:28.774
Why don't we just...

637
00:42:28.814 --> 00:42:30.782
We can work this out
like gentlemen.

638
00:43:00.812 --> 00:43:02.609
Don't worry, Lyra.

639
00:43:02.647 --> 00:43:04.308
We'll find Roger.

640
00:43:37.415 --> 00:43:38.973
I'm all right.

641
00:43:41.153 --> 00:43:42.518
What is it?

642
00:43:42.554 --> 00:43:44.249
It's a spy-fly.

643
00:43:44.289 --> 00:43:45.756
Is it dangerous?

644
00:43:47.125 --> 00:43:49.855
The one that got away is.

645
00:43:49.895 --> 00:43:52.227
If you was to crack it open...

646
00:43:52.264 --> 00:43:54.824
you'd find no living thing in there.

647
00:43:54.866 --> 00:43:57.334
No animal or insect, at any rate.

648
00:43:57.369 --> 00:43:59.303
There's a clockwork...

649
00:43:59.337 --> 00:44:03.205
and pinned to the spring of it
is a bad spirit...

650
00:44:03.241 --> 00:44:06.005
with a sleeping poison in its sting.

651
00:44:07.245 --> 00:44:09.975
We'll keep him safe in here.

652
00:44:11.316 --> 00:44:13.807
What was it after?

653
00:44:13.852 --> 00:44:15.820
- You, Lyra.
- Why me?

654
00:44:15.854 --> 00:44:17.651
Why are they doing this?

655
00:44:17.689 --> 00:44:19.452
We don't know.

656
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:21.288
But we Gyptians...

657
00:44:21.326 --> 00:44:25.057
have been hurt worse than most
by these Gobblers...

658
00:44:25.096 --> 00:44:27.997
these child-thieves.

659
00:44:28.033 --> 00:44:30.524
They're takin' those children up North...

660
00:44:30.569 --> 00:44:33.697
the land of cold and dark...

661
00:44:33.738 --> 00:44:37.367
and what they're doing
with them there, we don't know...

662
00:44:37.409 --> 00:44:40.173
but we have heard terrible rumor.

663
00:44:42.214 --> 00:44:44.045
Our aim...

664
00:44:44.082 --> 00:44:47.813
is first to go North
and to rescue these children...

665
00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:51.185
both Gyptian and landloper alike.

666
00:44:54.326 --> 00:44:58.524
But if they have been harmed...

667
00:44:58.563 --> 00:45:00.622
I promise you...

668
00:45:00.665 --> 00:45:03.532
if they have been harmed...

669
00:45:03.568 --> 00:45:08.062
there is not a place
nor on land nor on sea...

670
00:45:08.106 --> 00:45:09.869
for these Gobblers.

671
00:45:09.908 --> 00:45:12.877
And when the time comes to punish...

672
00:45:12.911 --> 00:45:19.043
we will strike such a blow as'll make
their hearts faint and fearful.

673
00:45:19.084 --> 00:45:20.108
Yes!

674
00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:23.609
We will strike the strength
out of them.

675
00:45:23.655 --> 00:45:28.422
We will leave them
broken and shattered.

676
00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.518
Yes!

677
00:45:46.244 --> 00:45:48.212
Are you getting scared, pan?

678
00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:50.043
Scared?

679
00:45:50.081 --> 00:45:51.571
A little.

680
00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:55.613
It's all bigger and scarier
than we ever thought.

681
00:45:55.654 --> 00:45:58.817
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

682
00:45:58.857 --> 00:46:02.418
But we've got to, though, ain't we?

683
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.291
Go on, I mean.

684
00:46:12.304 --> 00:46:14.169
Who are you?

685
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.538
My name is Serafina pekkala...

686
00:46:17.575 --> 00:46:20.373
clan-queen of the witches
of Lake Enara.

687
00:46:20.412 --> 00:46:21.743
A witch?

688
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.771
Where's your daemon?

689
00:46:23.815 --> 00:46:26.841
Kaisa can fly a long way from me.

690
00:46:28.186 --> 00:46:30.416
Are you the girl
the Magisterium seeks?

691
00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:32.423
The one with a symbol reader?

692
00:46:37.529 --> 00:46:39.360
Let me see you read it.

693
00:46:39.397 --> 00:46:41.592
I want to know
if you can tell me...

694
00:46:41.633 --> 00:46:44.966
which of the men
on this ship was once...

695
00:46:45.003 --> 00:46:46.436
my lover.

696
00:47:15.367 --> 00:47:16.664
Farder Coram?

697
00:47:17.702 --> 00:47:18.930
But...

698
00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:21.564
He was young and beautiful once.

699
00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:24.973
And we witches live
for hundreds of years.

700
00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:26.840
Farder Coram wishes to know...

701
00:47:26.878 --> 00:47:29.346
where the child-cutters
take their prey.

702
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:32.009
It is a place...

703
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.245
they call Bolvangar.

704
00:47:34.285 --> 00:47:36.014
The place of fear.

705
00:47:36.054 --> 00:47:39.820
A regiment of Tartars
with wolf daemons guards it.

706
00:47:39.858 --> 00:47:41.985
Birds do not fly above.

707
00:47:42.026 --> 00:47:43.493
Animals have fled.

708
00:47:43.528 --> 00:47:46.156
Even the Samoyeds fear it.

709
00:47:47.699 --> 00:47:51.692
It is a week's march from Trollesund,
on the coast of Norroway.

710
00:47:51.736 --> 00:47:54.762
You will find something
to help you in Trollesund.

711
00:47:54.806 --> 00:47:57.070
You will need all your courage.

712
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.840
I'm glad I've lived long enough
to see you...

713
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:04.676
child.

714
00:48:44.522 --> 00:48:47.047
Who's going to help us?

715
00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:49.116
Can you see anything?

716
00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.685
Lyra, you're not listening to me.

717
00:49:03.975 --> 00:49:06.603
That's a mighty fancy
clockwork you got there.

718
00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.775
It's just a toy.

719
00:49:12.584 --> 00:49:15.109
Well, then,
it's a mighty fancy toy.

720
00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:20.923
How'd you come by somethin' like that?

721
00:49:20.959 --> 00:49:25.157
Oh, Lord. Lee, when you gonna learn
to mind your own business?

722
00:49:26.197 --> 00:49:27.994
I do beg pardon.

723
00:49:28.032 --> 00:49:29.693
Lee Scoresby.

724
00:49:29.734 --> 00:49:31.326
And this old gal is Hester.

725
00:49:32.704 --> 00:49:35.138
I'm Lyra. And this is pan.

726
00:49:35.173 --> 00:49:36.504
Pantalaimon.

727
00:49:36.541 --> 00:49:39.203
- Howdy.
- Mighty pleased, Miss Lyra.

728
00:49:40.278 --> 00:49:43.770
You rode in with them Gyptian fellers.
Am I right?

729
00:49:43.815 --> 00:49:45.942
- Whoa, boy.
- There I go again.

730
00:49:45.984 --> 00:49:47.349
Don't answer that.

731
00:49:47.385 --> 00:49:50.877
What are you doing
in Trollesund, Mr. Scoresby?

732
00:49:50.922 --> 00:49:54.449
Oh, a friend of mine
got himself in a fix.

733
00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:56.790
So I come to see
what I could do about it.

734
00:49:56.828 --> 00:49:58.295
Me too.

735
00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:00.559
Course, that ain't
my normal occupation.

736
00:50:00.598 --> 00:50:04.932
Most of the time,
I ply my trade up in the sky.

737
00:50:06.004 --> 00:50:07.471
You're an aeronaut!

738
00:50:09.007 --> 00:50:10.907
Can I go up in your ship?

739
00:50:10.942 --> 00:50:13.137
I'd be honored.

740
00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:15.168
Just as soon as
I get her out of hock.

741
00:50:17.482 --> 00:50:18.915
Miss Lyra...

742
00:50:19.984 --> 00:50:22.145
I'd like to give you
a word of advice...

743
00:50:22.186 --> 00:50:24.780
though you ain't asked for none.

744
00:50:24.822 --> 00:50:27.586
If I was on the kinda... scout...

745
00:50:27.625 --> 00:50:30.150
that I reckon you're on...

746
00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:33.459
I'd hire myself an aeronaut...

747
00:50:33.498 --> 00:50:35.090
and an armoured bear.

748
00:50:35.133 --> 00:50:37.260
An armoured bear?

749
00:50:37.302 --> 00:50:39.793
There's one in town.

750
00:50:39.837 --> 00:50:42.169
Iorek Byrnison's his name.

751
00:50:42.206 --> 00:50:45.733
Works at the sled depot
behind Einarsson's Bar.

752
00:50:45.777 --> 00:50:48.507
Good one to have
on your side in a scrap.

753
00:50:49.647 --> 00:50:51.478
Not that you're lookin' for that.

754
00:51:02.961 --> 00:51:06.590
Iorek Byrnison? Lorek Byrnison?

755
00:51:06.631 --> 00:51:09.998
May I speak to you?

756
00:51:12.103 --> 00:51:13.195
What?

757
00:51:13.237 --> 00:51:15.569
We want to offer you employment.

758
00:51:15.607 --> 00:51:19.873
I am employed, by the townspeople.

759
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:22.436
I mend broken machinery.

760
00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:25.472
I lift heavy objects.

761
00:51:25.516 --> 00:51:28.974
What kind of work is that
for a panserbjorn?

762
00:51:31.055 --> 00:51:32.750
Paid work!

763
00:51:53.845 --> 00:51:56.040
Is that what they pay you?

764
00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.411
Whisky?

765
00:51:59.017 --> 00:52:00.348
Lorek Byrnison...

766
00:52:00.385 --> 00:52:03.582
you're the first ice bear I ever met.

767
00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:07.290
I was ever so excited,
and scared.

768
00:52:08.493 --> 00:52:10.757
But now I'm just disappointed.

769
00:52:10.795 --> 00:52:13.593
I heard that bears
lived to hunt and to fight.

770
00:52:14.699 --> 00:52:16.758
Why are you
wasting your time here...

771
00:52:16.801 --> 00:52:18.291
drinking whisky?

772
00:52:20.104 --> 00:52:24.097
I stay because
the people of this town...

773
00:52:24.142 --> 00:52:25.700
gave me spirits...

774
00:52:25.743 --> 00:52:28.507
and let me drink till I was asleep.

775
00:52:28.546 --> 00:52:31.379
Then they took my armour away.

776
00:52:31.416 --> 00:52:34.613
And without my armour,
I cannot go to war.

777
00:52:34.652 --> 00:52:38.588
And I am an armoured bear.

778
00:52:38.623 --> 00:52:42.059
War is the sea I swim in...

779
00:52:42.093 --> 00:52:44.823
the air I breathe.

780
00:52:44.862 --> 00:52:48.662
Without my armour, I am nothing.

781
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:52.659
But... can't you make new armour?

782
00:52:52.704 --> 00:52:55.764
I thought bears were good at that.

783
00:52:55.807 --> 00:52:57.672
There's all this metal around.

784
00:52:57.709 --> 00:52:59.677
Worthless!

785
00:53:01.446 --> 00:53:04.540
My armour is made of sky iron...

786
00:53:04.582 --> 00:53:08.575
from the falling stars
that land in Svalbard.

787
00:53:08.619 --> 00:53:12.055
A bear's armour is his soul...

788
00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:15.082
as your daemon is your soul.

789
00:53:15.126 --> 00:53:16.684
Irreplaceable.

790
00:53:16.728 --> 00:53:20.289
You may as well take him away
and replace him with a doll.

791
00:53:22.033 --> 00:53:25.366
It must have been terrible
to lose your armour.

792
00:53:25.403 --> 00:53:28.338
It was no less than I deserved.

793
00:53:29.507 --> 00:53:31.372
I am an exile.

794
00:53:31.409 --> 00:53:36.403
I was sent away from Svalbard
because I was unworthy.

795
00:53:36.447 --> 00:53:39.780
I fought another bear
in single combat...

796
00:53:39.817 --> 00:53:42.513
and was defeated.

797
00:53:50.962 --> 00:53:53.396
- Come, child.
- But Farder Coram...

798
00:53:53.431 --> 00:53:55.524
We can't involve ourselves.

799
00:54:25.363 --> 00:54:27.331
He was a prince.

800
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:32.558
He would have been a king
if the other bear hadn't defeated him.

801
00:54:32.603 --> 00:54:34.798
He lost everything.

802
00:54:34.839 --> 00:54:37.637
Oh, pan, they've really hurt him.

803
00:54:41.012 --> 00:54:44.641
Iorek Byrnison? Lorek Byrnison.

804
00:54:46.017 --> 00:54:49.111
- Be careful.
- I know where your armour is.

805
00:54:51.622 --> 00:54:53.920
They tricked you out of it.

806
00:54:53.958 --> 00:54:55.926
They shouldn't have done that,
lorek Byrnison.

807
00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:00.329
It's in the district office
of the Magisterium.

808
00:55:00.364 --> 00:55:02.798
Right here in Trollesund.

809
00:55:02.834 --> 00:55:05.530
What is your name, child?

810
00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:07.333
Lyra Belacqua.

811
00:55:07.371 --> 00:55:10.932
Then, Lyra Belacqua...

812
00:55:10.975 --> 00:55:13.443
I owe you a debt.

813
00:55:13.477 --> 00:55:16.207
I will serve you in your campaign...

814
00:55:16.247 --> 00:55:18.374
until I am dead...

815
00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:21.647
or you have a victory.

816
00:56:17.408 --> 00:56:18.739
Iorek!

817
00:56:19.844 --> 00:56:22.335
Lorek Byrnison!

818
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:25.838
Lorek, listen.
Don't fight these men.

819
00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:28.010
What they done ain't right, I know.

820
00:56:28.052 --> 00:56:30.077
But if you fight, you'll kill them.

821
00:56:30.121 --> 00:56:31.486
And there'll be more fighting...

822
00:56:31.522 --> 00:56:33.456
and we'll never get away
to rescue those kids.

823
00:56:39.263 --> 00:56:41.663
Let's not be too hasty.

824
00:56:41.699 --> 00:56:45.032
Way I see it,
there's no need for a dust-up.

825
00:56:46.704 --> 00:56:50.105
Howdy, lorek.
I was down South.

826
00:56:50.141 --> 00:56:53.042
Heard you ran into
a little local trouble.

827
00:56:53.077 --> 00:56:56.478
Didn't have the first notion
on how to spring ya.

828
00:56:56.514 --> 00:56:58.004
Fortunately, little girls...

829
00:56:58.049 --> 00:57:00.279
come in real resourceful
up in these parts.

830
00:57:03.554 --> 00:57:06.785
Well, looky here. Reinforcements.

831
00:57:08.659 --> 00:57:11.822
What do you say you fellers
just call it a day?

832
00:57:15.967 --> 00:57:18.993
Just been hired on
by these gentlemen...

833
00:57:19.036 --> 00:57:21.971
of the Gyptian persuasion.

834
00:57:22.006 --> 00:57:24.497
You figurin' on joining
this turkey shoot?

835
00:57:24.542 --> 00:57:28.103
Yes. I have a contract
with the child.

836
00:57:30.848 --> 00:57:33.681
That's some pretty
fast work, Miss Lyra.

837
00:57:56.007 --> 00:57:57.998
My lord.

838
00:58:00.745 --> 00:58:03.839
Rise, Fra pavel.

839
00:58:03.881 --> 00:58:05.678
I have received your news...

840
00:58:05.716 --> 00:58:10.119
about the Gyptian party
heading to the North.

841
00:58:10.154 --> 00:58:12.281
The matter is of
the first importance.

842
00:58:12.323 --> 00:58:15.690
They must be eliminated,
and Bolvangar protected.

843
00:58:17.128 --> 00:58:21.292
The intercision process is
more important than ever.

844
00:58:21.332 --> 00:58:24.165
Which is why it must be
taken out of the hands...

845
00:58:24.201 --> 00:58:26.499
of the Coulter woman.

846
00:58:30.341 --> 00:58:34.801
It was Mrs. Coulter
who took the Belacqua child...

847
00:58:34.845 --> 00:58:37.507
from Jordan College
and then let her slip away.

848
00:58:37.548 --> 00:58:40.540
Yes, that is
the most troubling of all.

849
00:58:41.786 --> 00:58:45.017
No matter.
One way or another...

850
00:58:45.056 --> 00:58:47.456
it's better that I've sent
Mrs. Coulter after the child.

851
00:58:47.491 --> 00:58:49.823
- You've sent her?
- Yes.

852
00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:52.226
She is to demonstrate
the improvements...

853
00:58:52.263 --> 00:58:56.131
to the intercision process
upon the Belacqua girl.

854
00:59:20.191 --> 00:59:22.921
I'm sorry.

855
00:59:29.633 --> 00:59:32.193
I would never hurt you.

856
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:40.300
Oh, Lyra.

857
00:59:42.546 --> 00:59:45.140
I'll find you.

858
00:59:45.182 --> 00:59:47.946
I will find you.

859
01:00:04.502 --> 01:00:07.027
Careful now, boys.

860
01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:10.632
Airship machinery's kind of finicky.

861
01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:14.132
I want to die in a rocking chair,
not a hydrogen fire.

862
01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:16.646
And she was ever so clever,
Mrs. Coulter...

863
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.671
but she was always
telling me what to do.

864
01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:20.741
I don't like people
telling me what to do.

865
01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:23.446
I bet you don't like it either.
I can tell.

866
01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:25.455
You're like my Uncle Asriel.

867
01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:28.583
He's a rough noble like you.
That's what I think.

868
01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:38.667
Samoyed lands.

869
01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:42.297
Samoyeds don't take
kindly to trespassers.

870
01:00:42.339 --> 01:00:45.433
It's the only way
to reach Bolvangar.

871
01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:50.571
Stay close to me.

872
01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:53.640
- Come, child.
- It will be dark soon.

873
01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:05.161
How far do you reckon?

874
01:01:05.196 --> 01:01:07.858
Oh, I don't know for sure,
but a good few miles.

875
01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:10.628
We covered some ground.

876
01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:35.991
What's wrong?
What can you see?

877
01:01:41.966 --> 01:01:43.831
- Where are we going?
- Hush, pan.

878
01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.767
They told us not to leave the tent.

879
01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:47.100
Is he coming, then?

880
01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:50.402
Don't know. I'll have a look.

881
01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:07.552
Iorek?

882
01:02:07.591 --> 01:02:10.526
What is it, child?

883
01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:13.792
The alethiometer keeps
telling me something.

884
01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:17.358
In the next valley,
there's a lake with a house by it...

885
01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:19.665
and it's troubled by a ghost.

886
01:02:19.703 --> 01:02:23.195
It's something to do
with the Gobblers and Roger.

887
01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.869
You could take me there,
couldn't you?

888
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.810
You could carry me
there and back...

889
01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:30.677
before anyone knew,
couldn't you?

890
01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:35.040
You wish to ride me?

891
01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.019
Yeah.

892
01:02:37.054 --> 01:02:40.182
We will travel faster without armour.

893
01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:17.220
Are those birds?

894
01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:18.922
Witches.

895
01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:22.691
More than I have ever seen.

896
01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:24.724
Where are they going?

897
01:03:24.768 --> 01:03:27.566
Flying to war.

898
01:03:28.839 --> 01:03:30.932
If they are flying
to the aid of your enemies...

899
01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:33.204
you should all be afraid.

900
01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:35.606
Are you afraid?

901
01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.443
No.

902
01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:41.144
When I am, I will master my fear.

903
01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:12.073
I will make sure the way is clear.

904
01:04:12.116 --> 01:04:14.778
No. Stay here.

905
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.370
Lyra, no, please don't.

906
01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:41.378
Something's wrong.

907
01:04:41.412 --> 01:04:44.870
- Hush, pan.
- Something terrible.

908
01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:47.349
I'm afraid.

909
01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.944
We've got to master our fear.

910
01:05:11.775 --> 01:05:13.970
Hello?

911
01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:16.002
Hello?

912
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:42.600
Billy.

913
01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:45.005
Where's his daemon?

914
01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.806
He doesn't have a daemon.

915
01:05:47.845 --> 01:05:49.710
That's...

916
01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:51.407
intercision.

917
01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:56.014
That's what
the Gobblers are doing...

918
01:05:58.522 --> 01:06:01.082
cuttin' away kids' daemons.

919
01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:04.359
Where's my Ratter?

920
01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:06.419
Have you seen her?

921
01:06:08.499 --> 01:06:10.467
Billy, it's me, Lyra.

922
01:06:10.501 --> 01:06:13.470
Let me take you
back to your mum.

923
01:06:13.504 --> 01:06:15.563
I need Ratter.

924
01:06:15.606 --> 01:06:18.268
Billy, come on with me.

925
01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.435
We'll take you someplace safe.

926
01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:22.138
We'll find Ratter.

927
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:41.297
Gracious God, what's this?

928
01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.261
Lyra, child,
what have you found?

929
01:06:47.304 --> 01:06:50.967
Billy. Billy Costa.

930
01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:52.441
Billy!

931
01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:57.840
Oh, Billy!
You're all right, Billy.

932
01:06:57.881 --> 01:07:00.111
You're safe now.

933
01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:02.246
We'll find your daemon.

934
01:07:02.286 --> 01:07:05.119
We'll bring 'er back.

935
01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:24.973
Here, take Lyra.
Gyptians, to arms!

936
01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.082
- Watch your backs!
- Protect the children!

937
01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.861
Look out, Lyra!

938
01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:02.905
Lorek!

939
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.044
Lorek Byrnison, help me!

940
01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:26.929
Pan, where are they taking us?

941
01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:28.938
I don't know.
We've been going for hours.

942
01:08:42.552 --> 01:08:44.520
Ice bears, pan.

943
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:48.751
I hope you're happy now.

944
01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.038
You're losing your touch, amigo.

945
01:09:06.877 --> 01:09:08.367
So am I.

946
01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:10.812
Don't worry.

947
01:09:10.847 --> 01:09:12.542
We'll get her back.

948
01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:17.218
The Samoyeds
won't lay a hand on her.

949
01:09:17.254 --> 01:09:19.688
She's worth more in one piece.

950
01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.355
I'll find her.

951
01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:28.887
I'll bring her back.
I can bargain with Ragnar.

952
01:09:30.467 --> 01:09:33.732
I'll drop you at the border,
pick you up on the way out.

953
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.739
No. I will not leave her.

954
01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:41.335
You show up in Svalbard...

955
01:09:41.378 --> 01:09:43.369
Ragnar and the rest of 'em
will tear you to pieces.

956
01:09:43.413 --> 01:09:44.971
You know that.

957
01:09:45.015 --> 01:09:47.040
I know I would feel ashamed...

958
01:09:47.084 --> 01:09:49.780
to show less courage
than that child.

959
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.846
That kind of courage
could get you killed.

960
01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:57.121
I will not live in shame
any longer, Scoresby.

961
01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:00.289
No.

962
01:10:01.565 --> 01:10:03.556
I reckon not.

963
01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:07.702
I'm gonna take her down,
pick up the trail.

964
01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:17.847
Don't worry. Iorek will come.

965
01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:22.944
That's just it, pan.
There's too many of them for him to fight.

966
01:10:28.258 --> 01:10:30.351
We've got to do something.

967
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:38.467
Do you remember
what Mrs. Coulter said back at Jordan...

968
01:10:38.502 --> 01:10:41.630
about the king of the bears
wanting a daemon?

969
01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:47.036
Pan, I need you to hide.

970
01:10:47.077 --> 01:10:50.376
- Don't let them see you.
- That's fine with me.

971
01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:53.143
We can beat him, pan.

972
01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:07.922
What is this little thing?

973
01:11:09.232 --> 01:11:12.360
Our greetings to you, great king.

974
01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:16.429
Or rather, my greetings and not his.

975
01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:18.668
Not whose?

976
01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:21.506
Lorek Byrnison's, Your Majesty.

977
01:11:21.545 --> 01:11:26.073
What have you
to do with lorek Byrnison?

978
01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:31.686
I am lorek Byrnison's daemon.

979
01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:37.358
And how has the exile...

980
01:11:37.394 --> 01:11:41.125
the unworthy lorek Byrnison,
obtained a daemon?

981
01:11:41.164 --> 01:11:44.190
Lorek Byrnison was
the first bear to get a daemon...

982
01:11:44.234 --> 01:11:45.963
but it should've been you.

983
01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:49.802
They gave me to him at Bolvangar.
Mrs. Coulter did.

984
01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:53.537
And how could you be
so far from him?

985
01:11:53.577 --> 01:11:56.045
I'm like a witch's daemon, great king.

986
01:11:56.079 --> 01:11:59.810
- I can go as far from him as I please.
- Well...

987
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:01.784
if you are his daemon...

988
01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:05.777
then I will kill you right now
and be free of an enemy.

989
01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:08.382
If you do that,
I can never be your daemon.

990
01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:11.886
My... daemon?

991
01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:14.260
That's why I come here, see?

992
01:12:14.297 --> 01:12:16.765
'Cause I want to be
your daemon, not his.

993
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.792
He's just an exile, nothing.

994
01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:23.363
But you, you're powerful
and clever and rich...

995
01:12:23.406 --> 01:12:26.603
and better in every way.

996
01:12:26.643 --> 01:12:29.669
He's on his way here now,
to fight you.

997
01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:32.546
What? He's mad.

998
01:12:32.582 --> 01:12:35.073
- We shall destroy him!
- No.

999
01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:36.608
No.

1000
01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:40.585
If you defeat him,
I will become your daemon.

1001
01:12:40.624 --> 01:12:43.354
But you must defeat him
in single combat.

1002
01:12:43.393 --> 01:12:47.329
Then all his strength
will flow into yours...

1003
01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:51.698
and my mind will flow
into your mind.

1004
01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:54.169
You and me, together.

1005
01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:58.673
Have him killed any other way...

1006
01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:01.836
and I'll just go out like a light,
and you'll never have a daemon.

1007
01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.176
Prove it.

1008
01:13:04.214 --> 01:13:07.479
Prove to me that you are a daemon.

1009
01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:10.077
Ask me something only you know.

1010
01:13:13.123 --> 01:13:15.683
How did I become king?

1011
01:13:24.935 --> 01:13:26.926
What is that?

1012
01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:29.336
It's a daemon mirror, great king.

1013
01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:33.172
We daemons use it to see
the truth in our own eyes.

1014
01:13:54.831 --> 01:13:58.562
Truly you are great
and powerful, Ragnar...

1015
01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:01.069
for you poisoned the old king...

1016
01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:04.631
then challenged the heir to the throne
and beat him in single combat.

1017
01:14:07.177 --> 01:14:09.407
Iorek Byrnison.

1018
01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:33.662
Oh, pan, what have I done?

1019
01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:35.432
Ragnar's too strong.

1020
01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:43.371
So here he is.

1021
01:14:43.413 --> 01:14:46.109
But what if the coward
dare not fight me?

1022
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:49.084
Great king, let me speak to him.

1023
01:14:49.119 --> 01:14:51.747
- If I do, he will not suspect.
- Very well.

1024
01:14:51.788 --> 01:14:54.484
You go to him. Give him courage.

1025
01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:57.084
Bring him to his death.

1026
01:14:57.127 --> 01:15:00.028
Soon you'll be mine.

1027
01:15:12.409 --> 01:15:14.206
Oh, lorek.

1028
01:15:14.244 --> 01:15:16.974
Iorek, dear,
I've done a terrible thing.

1029
01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:20.449
What terrible thing?

1030
01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:26.077
I told the king I was your daemon
and that he must fight you.

1031
01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:28.090
If not, they would never let you fight.

1032
01:15:28.124 --> 01:15:30.149
They would burn you
before you even got up close.

1033
01:15:31.361 --> 01:15:32.953
But you've been fighting...

1034
01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:34.827
and running all this way.

1035
01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:38.732
Lyra. Lyra Belacqua.

1036
01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:43.102
No, I shall call you
Lyra Silvertongue.

1037
01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:46.802
To fight him is all I want.

1038
01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:49.835
Come, little daemon.

1039
01:15:58.054 --> 01:16:00.022
Fight well, lorek, my dear.

1040
01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:02.320
You're the real king,
and he ain't nothing.

1041
01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:05.555
Lyra, if I am killed...

1042
01:16:05.595 --> 01:16:07.688
Scoresby will find you.

1043
01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:52.999
Is that all...

1044
01:17:53.036 --> 01:17:54.594
whimpering cub?

1045
01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:56.730
Is that all...

1046
01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:58.400
soon-to-die?

1047
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:04.105
Is that all? Huh?

1048
01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:16.120
Is that all?

1049
01:18:37.747 --> 01:18:40.614
Yes, that is all.

1050
01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:43.585
That is all.

1051
01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:49.286
Bears, who is your king?

1052
01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:07.172
Lorek...

1053
01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:09.804
Iorek, I thought I'd lost you.

1054
01:19:09.846 --> 01:19:11.370
Why?

1055
01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:14.076
You still own my contract.

1056
01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:20.084
And now I will take you to Bolvangar.

1057
01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:26.292
We've got to stop them, lorek.

1058
01:19:26.329 --> 01:19:28.422
The alethiometer says
they'll hurt Roger.

1059
01:19:52.255 --> 01:19:53.722
There.

1060
01:20:11.341 --> 01:20:13.673
It may not hold us both.

1061
01:20:14.444 --> 01:20:17.140
You cross on your own.
I will follow.

1062
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:29.385
I'm right here. Step quickly.

1063
01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:31.416
Don't look down.

1064
01:20:48.144 --> 01:20:51.238
Don't look back!
You're almost there.

1065
01:21:07.897 --> 01:21:09.660
Run, Lyra!

1066
01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:11.997
Run! Run!

1067
01:21:20.009 --> 01:21:23.274
Lyra! I will get
Scoresby and the Gyptians.

1068
01:21:26.549 --> 01:21:28.608
Wait for me there!

1069
01:21:28.651 --> 01:21:31.484
Lyra! Wait!

1070
01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:46.699
I don't like the look of this place.

1071
01:21:52.642 --> 01:21:54.837
Bolvangar.

1072
01:21:54.877 --> 01:21:57.072
Hello, there.

1073
01:21:57.113 --> 01:22:01.015
I got lost in the snow. Where am I?

1074
01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:02.950
No need to worry, my child.

1075
01:22:02.985 --> 01:22:04.885
You're safe now.

1076
01:22:12.762 --> 01:22:14.696
Well, you'd better come inside.

1077
01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:16.664
It's warm and comfortable in here.

1078
01:22:16.699 --> 01:22:20.100
- What's your name?
- Don't tell him who we are.

1079
01:22:21.671 --> 01:22:24.504
Lizzie. Lizzie Brooks.

1080
01:22:27.710 --> 01:22:30.178
What were you doing
so far north, Lizzie?

1081
01:22:30.213 --> 01:22:32.374
That must be an interesting story.

1082
01:22:32.415 --> 01:22:35.441
My dad and uncles,
they took me north.

1083
01:22:35.485 --> 01:22:37.453
They're traders.

1084
01:22:37.487 --> 01:22:41.821
Well, you're very lucky
to have found us when you got lost.

1085
01:22:41.858 --> 01:22:43.450
What is this place?

1086
01:22:43.493 --> 01:22:45.984
Oh, you'll like it.

1087
01:22:46.028 --> 01:22:48.553
It's called the Experimental Station.

1088
01:22:48.598 --> 01:22:50.463
What do you do here?

1089
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.434
We help children grow up.

1090
01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:55.733
- Liar.
- You must be hungry, Lizzie. Lucky you.

1091
01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:58.069
Just in time for dinner.

1092
01:23:14.056 --> 01:23:16.286
Can you see him?
Is he here?

1093
01:23:31.807 --> 01:23:33.274
- Lyra, it's them.
- Pan!

1094
01:23:33.309 --> 01:23:35.072
- You found us!
- You're all right!

1095
01:23:35.111 --> 01:23:37.705
You kept your promise!

1096
01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:50.516
I knew you'd come.

1097
01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.187
I promised, didn't I?

1098
01:24:00.002 --> 01:24:03.563
Roger, do you know
what they do to the kids here?

1099
01:24:04.941 --> 01:24:07.603
They say they're gonna give us
this operation, right?

1100
01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:09.372
Then they'll send us home...

1101
01:24:09.412 --> 01:24:11.209
and we won't have
to worry about Dust.

1102
01:24:12.181 --> 01:24:14.274
But once they call a kid in...

1103
01:24:14.317 --> 01:24:16.012
you'll never see them again.

1104
01:24:16.052 --> 01:24:18.850
They took Billy Costa
away last week...

1105
01:24:18.888 --> 01:24:20.253
and he's still gone.

1106
01:24:20.289 --> 01:24:23.486
Don't worry.
I've got a plan, all right?

1107
01:24:25.528 --> 01:24:28.964
Tell the kids to have
their warm clothes ready.

1108
01:24:28.998 --> 01:24:31.057
I need to be alone someplace.

1109
01:24:32.168 --> 01:24:33.863
But not here.

1110
01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:40.332
They hardly ever use this one,
but be quick.

1111
01:24:57.727 --> 01:24:59.820
Ask it how
we're gonna get out of here.

1112
01:25:03.099 --> 01:25:05.067
But why would it...

1113
01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:07.126
Oh, no. It's them.

1114
01:25:07.169 --> 01:25:08.761
I think you'll be pleased with our progress.

1115
01:25:08.804 --> 01:25:12.433
That may be so,
but I am very interested in discovering...

1116
01:25:12.475 --> 01:25:15.967
how several children managed
to wander free from the station.

1117
01:25:18.581 --> 01:25:20.208
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Coulter...

1118
01:25:20.249 --> 01:25:22.740
I hope you'll understand
that the question is moot.

1119
01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:25.481
Any child who escapes
from the facility...

1120
01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:27.614
would not last
very long in the cold.

1121
01:25:27.657 --> 01:25:30.558
We have already recovered
two of the three missing children.

1122
01:25:31.127 --> 01:25:32.788
Were they alive?

1123
01:25:37.433 --> 01:25:39.731
Well, that is unfortunate.

1124
01:25:40.603 --> 01:25:42.468
But enough of that for now.

1125
01:25:42.505 --> 01:25:44.666
I, at least, have some good news.

1126
01:25:46.676 --> 01:25:49.645
We needn't be concerned
with Lord Asriel any longer.

1127
01:25:52.248 --> 01:25:55.274
He has bribed his captors
and set up a secret laboratory...

1128
01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.877
in the furthest reaches
of the North.

1129
01:25:59.789 --> 01:26:03.190
The Magisterium soldiers
are on their way.

1130
01:26:03.225 --> 01:26:07.286
He will be arrested for heresy
and sentenced to death.

1131
01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:09.661
Put him to death? Dear me.

1132
01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:15.569
I think I will retire for the evening.

1133
01:26:15.604 --> 01:26:17.572
Oh, well, yes, of course.

1134
01:26:17.606 --> 01:26:20.074
The orderlies will show you
to your chambers.

1135
01:26:24.647 --> 01:26:26.979
Wouldn't want to get
on the wrong side of her. I tell you that.

1136
01:26:27.016 --> 01:26:29.644
She's positively ghoulish.

1137
01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:31.812
Do you remember
the first experiments...

1138
01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:34.118
when she was so keen
to see them pulled apart?

1139
01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:36.624
Her and that mute of a daemon.

1140
01:26:36.659 --> 01:26:38.251
- What was that?
- Down there.

1141
01:26:38.294 --> 01:26:39.625
- Under the table.
- Quick!

1142
01:26:39.662 --> 01:26:41.596
- Lyra!
- Grab her leg!

1143
01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:42.688
Lyra, they've got me!

1144
01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:45.697
Come here.

1145
01:26:45.735 --> 01:26:47.669
- Come on.
- Lyra!

1146
01:26:49.672 --> 01:26:51.469
- You can't!
- Let me go! Get off me!

1147
01:26:51.507 --> 01:26:53.941
You're not allowed!

1148
01:26:55.344 --> 01:26:57.209
Lyra!

1149
01:27:03.819 --> 01:27:05.582
Quickly now. Straight into the chamber.

1150
01:27:05.621 --> 01:27:08.419
Let me go. Iorek Byrnison's gonna kill you.

1151
01:27:08.457 --> 01:27:10.652
- He'll rip your guts out!
- What a...

1152
01:27:11.994 --> 01:27:15.521
Don't fret, dear.
It's only a little cut.

1153
01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:18.863
- You'll never keep us apart.
- You want to grow up, don't you?

1154
01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:21.995
- Well, this is how you grow up.
- Stay away from me!

1155
01:27:22.037 --> 01:27:25.097
- You'll never keep us apart!
- Set phase two.

1156
01:27:25.141 --> 01:27:27.200
Never, never!

1157
01:27:32.314 --> 01:27:34.009
No, stop!

1158
01:27:34.049 --> 01:27:36.176
- Lyra!
- Pan!

1159
01:27:36.218 --> 01:27:38.584
- No!
- Never!

1160
01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:41.787
You can't!

1161
01:27:44.226 --> 01:27:46.057
- Don't leave me, pan.
- No!

1162
01:27:46.095 --> 01:27:48.393
- Stop!
- No! Help me!

1163
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.091
Lyra!

1164
01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:57.063
Lyra!

1165
01:28:26.702 --> 01:28:28.795
Lyra. Darling.

1166
01:28:28.838 --> 01:28:30.829
- Don't. Don't you touch.
- No, no. No, no one will hurt you.

1167
01:28:30.873 --> 01:28:34.001
No one is going to hurt you.
No one is ever...

1168
01:28:34.043 --> 01:28:35.738
ever going to hurt you.

1169
01:28:35.778 --> 01:28:39.578
They did it to Billy...

1170
01:28:39.615 --> 01:28:41.640
and those other kids.

1171
01:28:41.684 --> 01:28:44.380
They cut their daemons away.

1172
01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:47.480
Why? Why are they doing that?

1173
01:28:47.523 --> 01:28:51.459
I know it's difficult to understand,
but it's for their own good.

1174
01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:53.620
It's just a little cut.

1175
01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:57.598
You listen. Listen to me.

1176
01:28:57.633 --> 01:28:59.999
A long, long time ago...

1177
01:29:00.035 --> 01:29:02.526
some of our ancestors made...

1178
01:29:02.571 --> 01:29:04.869
made a terrible mistake.

1179
01:29:04.907 --> 01:29:07.603
They disobeyed...

1180
01:29:07.643 --> 01:29:09.838
the Authority.

1181
01:29:09.879 --> 01:29:13.110
And that is what made Dust
come into the world.

1182
01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:16.914
And ever since then, we have been sick
with it, we have been sick with Dust.

1183
01:29:16.952 --> 01:29:19.216
But there is a way out.

1184
01:29:19.255 --> 01:29:21.917
You see, Dust doesn't settle
on innocent children.

1185
01:29:23.259 --> 01:29:27.593
It's later, when your daemon
begins to settle...

1186
01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:30.360
that Dust begins
to swarm all around us...

1187
01:29:30.399 --> 01:29:33.960
trying to work its mischief.

1188
01:29:34.003 --> 01:29:37.370
And that is how children begin to have
all sorts of nasty thoughts...

1189
01:29:37.406 --> 01:29:39.931
and unhappy feelings and...

1190
01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:43.943
But there is a way to stop it.

1191
01:29:45.347 --> 01:29:48.942
A little cut, and gone forever.

1192
01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:52.317
Well, if it's so good,
then why don't you do it yourself?

1193
01:29:52.354 --> 01:29:54.185
Why didn't you let them do it to me?

1194
01:29:56.659 --> 01:29:59.787
I'm going to tell you something.

1195
01:29:59.828 --> 01:30:03.093
Something very important,
something you don't know.

1196
01:30:03.132 --> 01:30:05.623
Intercision isn't perfect yet...

1197
01:30:05.668 --> 01:30:08.102
and you're not just anyone, Lyra.

1198
01:30:08.137 --> 01:30:12.471
Your mother didn't die
in an airship accident as you were told.

1199
01:30:12.508 --> 01:30:16.376
She wasn't married to your father,
and even though...

1200
01:30:16.412 --> 01:30:20.007
even though she loved you
very much and...

1201
01:30:20.049 --> 01:30:21.983
and she wanted to keep you...

1202
01:30:23.852 --> 01:30:25.513
it wasn't allowed.

1203
01:30:27.222 --> 01:30:30.350
And so you were taken from her.

1204
01:30:30.392 --> 01:30:34.522
And it wasn't until things changed...

1205
01:30:34.563 --> 01:30:37.293
and she was free to do
as she wanted, that...

1206
01:30:40.102 --> 01:30:43.128
that she went to Jordan College
and she spoke to the Master.

1207
01:30:43.172 --> 01:30:45.640
No! You can't be!

1208
01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:56.310
Yes, Lyra, you're mine.

1209
01:30:56.352 --> 01:30:59.253
And you're safe with me.

1210
01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:02.257
You'll always be safe with me.

1211
01:31:05.027 --> 01:31:07.120
Who's my father?

1212
01:31:14.269 --> 01:31:17.761
Lord Asriel.
He's my father, isn't he?

1213
01:31:20.309 --> 01:31:23.608
Yes. Yes.

1214
01:31:33.489 --> 01:31:35.514
Now I almost forgot.

1215
01:31:35.557 --> 01:31:39.857
The Master of Jordan
gave you something, didn't he?

1216
01:31:39.895 --> 01:31:42.955
He gave you an alethiometer,
didn't he?

1217
01:31:44.533 --> 01:31:46.364
But you see...

1218
01:31:47.703 --> 01:31:50.399
it wasn't really his to give.

1219
01:31:52.474 --> 01:31:54.533
Ah, he did. Oh.

1220
01:31:54.576 --> 01:31:58.672
Must've seemed such a puzzle, what
a silly old thing like that was any good for.

1221
01:31:59.715 --> 01:32:01.774
All right.

1222
01:32:04.553 --> 01:32:06.646
Here it is.

1223
01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:08.349
Thank you.

1224
01:32:10.759 --> 01:32:13.592
What a funny old tin. Did you...

1225
01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:16.621
did you put it in here
to keep it safe?

1226
01:32:39.988 --> 01:32:42.047
Run! Lyra, let's go! Go!

1227
01:32:43.158 --> 01:32:45.718
We're just not used to that reaction.

1228
01:32:45.761 --> 01:32:48.457
Understand this, Sister Clara,
they're not registered...

1229
01:34:08.177 --> 01:34:10.611
Go on, then. Go on.

1230
01:34:36.672 --> 01:34:39.368
Iorek! Lorek!

1231
01:34:40.342 --> 01:34:41.741
Run, child!

1232
01:34:44.913 --> 01:34:47.211
Let's go! Come on!

1233
01:34:55.357 --> 01:34:57.120
- Quickly!
- Let's go!

1234
01:35:15.077 --> 01:35:18.171
You'd better not touch me.
I'm warning you.

1235
01:35:26.688 --> 01:35:28.815
Serafina pekkala?

1236
01:36:06.928 --> 01:36:09.795
- This way.
- Get out! Get out!

1237
01:36:09.831 --> 01:36:11.696
- Mrs. Coulter!
- Get her up.

1238
01:36:11.733 --> 01:36:13.894
Come!

1239
01:36:16.405 --> 01:36:18.464
- Come on, come on!
- Hurry!

1240
01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:40.219
Charge!

1241
01:36:40.262 --> 01:36:41.991
Come on! Run!

1242
01:36:59.715 --> 01:37:02.013
Come on! Get down, men!

1243
01:37:02.050 --> 01:37:04.848
Mr. Scoresby, help lorek!

1244
01:37:35.250 --> 01:37:36.911
Come on!

1245
01:38:23.432 --> 01:38:26.595
Joe! Oh, my precious!

1246
01:38:26.635 --> 01:38:29.433
- Dad!
- Oh, my goodness, boy!

1247
01:38:31.139 --> 01:38:32.629
- Darling!
- Mum!

1248
01:38:32.674 --> 01:38:34.403
Here's my daughter! Come here!

1249
01:38:40.682 --> 01:38:43.776
Gyptians! To me!

1250
01:38:43.819 --> 01:38:45.912
We're going home!

1251
01:38:48.924 --> 01:38:51.859
Lyra, we've got to go.

1252
01:38:51.893 --> 01:38:53.793
It's time to go home.

1253
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:56.525
I can't, Roger.

1254
01:38:56.565 --> 01:38:59.432
I've got to go to my father
and bring him the alethiometer.

1255
01:38:59.468 --> 01:39:02.164
- Your father?
- Lord Asriel...

1256
01:39:02.204 --> 01:39:04.832
Mrs. Coulter and them...
they're gonna kill him.

1257
01:39:04.873 --> 01:39:06.272
Then I'm going too.

1258
01:39:06.308 --> 01:39:10.267
You said you was gonna
come and get me. You got me.

1259
01:39:16.852 --> 01:39:20.618
Miss Lyra, are you ready to fly?

1260
01:39:23.425 --> 01:39:25.416
I know where she's going.

1261
01:39:39.774 --> 01:39:43.403
Well, they're all tucked in back there.

1262
01:39:43.445 --> 01:39:45.970
That little girl's somethin', huh?

1263
01:39:50.685 --> 01:39:53.586
There's a prophesy
about that child, Mr. Scoresby.

1264
01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:58.154
She will decide the war
which is to come.

1265
01:39:58.193 --> 01:39:59.558
War?

1266
01:40:01.296 --> 01:40:03.821
I ain't heard rumor of any war.

1267
01:40:03.865 --> 01:40:06.129
You will.

1268
01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:09.830
It is your war too,
whether you know it or not.

1269
01:40:09.871 --> 01:40:14.001
- What would the quarrel be about?
- Nothing less than free will.

1270
01:40:15.143 --> 01:40:19.671
The Magisterium not only seeks to
control everyone in this world...

1271
01:40:19.714 --> 01:40:22.182
but every world in every universe.

1272
01:40:24.986 --> 01:40:27.978
They've been unable
to extend their power until now.

1273
01:40:28.523 --> 01:40:32.220
But if Asriel finds
a way to travel between worlds...

1274
01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:36.026
nothing will stop them
from trying to take over.

1275
01:40:36.064 --> 01:40:38.032
Nothing but us...

1276
01:40:38.066 --> 01:40:40.091
and that child.

1277
01:40:50.111 --> 01:40:52.170
What's it telling you?

1278
01:41:06.528 --> 01:41:08.428
It's telling me about my father.

1279
01:41:09.464 --> 01:41:12.729
It says I'm bringing him
what he needs.

1280
01:41:12.767 --> 01:41:14.962
We're going home, aren't we, Lyra?

1281
01:41:15.003 --> 01:41:16.698
After we save your father.

1282
01:41:18.673 --> 01:41:20.334
Course.

1283
01:41:20.375 --> 01:41:23.708
'Cept, first we gotta sort out
some things that need sorting.

1284
01:41:23.745 --> 01:41:27.875
Like Billy and them other kids that lost
their daemons. We've got to help them.

1285
01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:30.240
And it isn't like the Magisterium's...

1286
01:41:30.285 --> 01:41:32.810
just gonna let us go home to Jordan
just like that...

1287
01:41:32.854 --> 01:41:35.049
or leave off ordering people about.

1288
01:41:36.291 --> 01:41:38.418
And Dust...

1289
01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:40.087
I want to know what Dust is.

1290
01:41:41.363 --> 01:41:44.696
Maybe we're supposed to go to that other
world with my father and find out.

1291
01:41:44.733 --> 01:41:47.031
That's an awful lot to sort out.

1292
01:41:47.068 --> 01:41:48.763
Well, who else is gonna do it?

1293
01:41:48.803 --> 01:41:51.397
'Sides, we're in this together now.

1294
01:41:51.439 --> 01:41:53.634
Yeah, suppose we are.

1295
01:41:55.410 --> 01:41:59.073
You reckon it would do any harm
to get some sleep now?

1296
01:41:59.114 --> 01:42:00.206
Go on, then.

1297
01:42:10.091 --> 01:42:12.321
We'll set things right.

1298
01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.726
We will.

1299
01:42:14.763 --> 01:42:17.163
You and me...

1300
01:42:17.198 --> 01:42:19.029
and lorek.

1301
01:42:19.067 --> 01:42:21.558
And Serafina pekkala
and Mr. Scoresby.

1302
01:42:23.805 --> 01:42:25.136
And my father.

1303
01:42:25.907 --> 01:42:27.772
We'll set it right, pan.

1304
01:42:30.178 --> 01:42:32.169
Just let them try to stop us.

1305
01:43:17.058 --> 01:43:20.425
<i> Where are our lives 

1306
01:43:20.462 --> 01:43:23.693
<i> If there is no dream? 

1307
01:43:23.732 --> 01:43:28.829
<i> Where is our home? 

1308
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:32.601
<i> We don't know how 

1309
01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:36.098
<i> There will be a way 

1310
01:43:36.144 --> 01:43:39.341
<i> Out of the storm 

1311
01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:47.014
<i> We will find hope 

1312
01:43:54.896 --> 01:44:02.064
<i> And her soul
walks beside her 

1313
01:44:02.103 --> 01:44:08.531
<i> An army stands behind her 

1314
01:44:08.576 --> 01:44:13.411
<i> Lyra 

1315
01:44:13.448 --> 01:44:15.643
<i> Lyra 

1316
01:44:15.683 --> 01:44:19.483
<i> And her face 

1317
01:44:19.521 --> 01:44:22.456
<i> Full of grace 

1318
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:26.517
<i> Two worlds
collide around her 

1319
01:44:26.561 --> 01:44:32.625
<i> The truth lies
deep inside her 

1320
01:44:32.667 --> 01:44:37.730
<i> Lyra 

1321
01:44:37.772 --> 01:44:40.263
<i> Lyra 

1322
01:44:40.308 --> 01:44:46.804
<i> And the stars
look down upon her 

1323
01:44:46.848 --> 01:44:53.117
<i> This darkness settles on her 

1324
01:44:53.154 --> 01:44:58.091
<i> Lyra 

1325
01:44:58.126 --> 01:45:00.321
<i> Lyra 

1326
01:45:00.361 --> 01:45:06.994
<i> Who's to know
what's in the future? 

1327
01:45:07.035 --> 01:45:10.937
<i> Every hope
we will be with her 

1328
01:45:10.972 --> 01:45:16.933
<i> We have all our love
to give her 

1329
01:45:16.978 --> 01:45:22.109
<i> Oh, Lyra 

1330
01:45:22.150 --> 01:45:24.414
<i> Lyra 

1331
01:45:24.452 --> 01:45:31.415
<i> And her soul
walks beside her 

1332
01:45:31.459 --> 01:45:37.591
<i> An army stands behind her 

1333
01:45:37.632 --> 01:45:42.365
<i> Lyra

01:45:42.403 --> 01:45:44.735
<i> Lyra 

1335
01:45:44.772 --> 01:45:48.674
<i> And her face 

1336
01:45:48.710 --> 01:45:52.009
<i> Full of grace 

1337
01:45:52.046 --> 01:45:55.846

01:46:02.023 --> 01:46:07.461

1340
01:46:07.495 --> 01:46:14.901
<i> Lyra
