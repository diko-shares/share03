1
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:44.629
There are
many universes and many earths...

2
00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:46.714
parallel to each other.

3
00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:50.426
Worlds like yours...

4
00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:53.930
where people's souls
live inside their bodies...

5
00:00:59.227 --> 00:01:01.270
...and worlds like mine...

6
00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:03.606
where they walk beside us...

7
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.443
as animal spirits
we call daemons.

8
00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:11.072
Are we going to see the child?

9
00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.116
I should think so.

10
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.370
So many worlds...

11
00:01:17.453 --> 00:01:20.665
but connecting them all is Dust.

12
00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:24.001
Dust was here before
the witches of the air...

13
00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:27.088
the Gyptians of the water...

14
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.674
and the bears of the ice.

15
00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:35.554
In my world,
scholars invented an alethiometer...

16
00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:39.558
a golden compass...

17
00:01:39.642 --> 00:01:42.603
and it showed them
all that was hidden.

18
00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:48.359
But the ruling power, fearing
any truth but their own...

19
00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:51.279
destroyed these devices...

20
00:01:51.362 --> 00:01:55.574
and forbade
the very mention of Dust.

21
00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:58.995
One compass remains, however...

22
00:01:59.078 --> 00:02:01.539
and only one who can read it.

23
00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:03.541
Aaah!
You'll never get me!

24
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:09.005
Let's go get 'em, Lyra.

25
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.133
Gonna get you!

26
00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:14.093
I'll get you first!

27
00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:15.803
Billy!

28
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:17.805
You come back here!

29
00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.223
Leave me alone!

30
00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:20.558
Faster, faster!

31
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:22.351
We're gonna get you!

32
00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:24.103
Run, Roger!

33
00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:27.857
- Unh!
- You are now Gobbled!

34
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.527
You've gotta do whatever I say!

35
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.279
- Ha ha ha ha!

36
00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:35.281
- Go, Roger! Run!

37
00:02:38.576 --> 00:02:39.493
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

38
00:02:39.577 --> 00:02:42.371
- Leave us alone!
- Get him!

39
00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:47.335
- Aah!
- Come on. Run!

40
00:02:50.463 --> 00:02:52.089
Hurry up, Roger,
or they'll Gobble you!

41
00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:54.383
Faster!

42
00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:01.640
- Hurry up!

43
00:03:01.724 --> 00:03:03.976
Stop!

44
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.980
If you value your lives,
come no further.

45
00:03:08.064 --> 00:03:09.231
Why?

46
00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:11.025
We Gobbled him fair and square.

47
00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.527
This ain't no game, Billy Costa.

48
00:03:13.611 --> 00:03:15.446
Don't you know what this gate is?

49
00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.823
It's the back door
to your stupid college.

50
00:03:17.907 --> 00:03:18.907
<i>Se'?</i>

51
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.327
There's a curse on this gate.

52
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.038
You Gyptians ought to know that.

53
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:25.247
Crossin' this gate...

54
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:27.833
is worse than touching
someone's daemon...

55
00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:29.210
with your bare hands.

56
00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:31.133
Why ain't nothin'
happened to you, then?

57
00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:33.422
'Cause we live 'ere.

58
00:03:33.506 --> 00:03:35.549
We got safe passage, see?

59
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:38.135
And anyway, my mother's
the one who put the curse...

60
00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.804
on this gate in the first place.

61
00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:41.180
What mother?

62
00:03:41.263 --> 00:03:42.932
I heard you was an orphink...

63
00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:46.143
and your uncle only left you 'ere
'cause nobody wanted you.

64
00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:47.770
Come 'ere and say that.

65
00:03:48.604 --> 00:03:50.481
Don't, Billy.

66
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.235
You should listen to your mate.

67
00:03:54.318 --> 00:03:57.905
The scholars got this special room
where they deal with trespassers.

68
00:03:57.988 --> 00:03:59.990
They got this poison gown, right...

69
00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:01.909
and it burns you alive!

70
00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:04.829
Rubbish. Hand him over.

71
00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:06.789
- It ain't rubbish.

72
00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:09.500
I'll prove it. I'll steal it.

73
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.210
You can have Roger.

74
00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:13.796
As long as you try it on.

75
00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.715
All right. Bring it with you tonight.

76
00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.092
Or else...

77
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.553
War.

78
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:23.431
Billy, don't!

79
00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:26.600
See ya later, then.

80
00:04:26.684 --> 00:04:28.519
OK.

81
00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:32.022
Well done, Billy!

82
00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:34.108
You ain't really gonna
hand me over to them?

83
00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:35.609
Of course not.

84
00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:37.403
I'll steal any old scholar's gown.

85
00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:39.447
He'll never try it on anyway.

86
00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:48.289
- Lord Asriel?
- Morning, Hunt.

87
00:04:48.372 --> 00:04:50.916
Well, the Master will be relieved
to hear you've arrived safely.

88
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.543
I'm sure he will.

89
00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:28.162
I wish you'd
listen to me once in a while.

90
00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:30.080
Stop being such a coward.

91
00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:32.541
If I weren't such a coward,
where would you be?

92
00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:35.586
In the Retiring Room already.

93
00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.385
Come on, quick.

94
00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.935
Let's find a robe
and get out of here.

95
00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:55.147
Don't be silly.
I want to look around.

96
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:58.025
You do know that if you get
a smack, I hurt too?

97
00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:05.241
Oh, Lyra.

98
00:06:05.324 --> 00:06:07.868
You're gonna get us caught.

99
00:06:07.952 --> 00:06:09.870
Ha ha ha.

100
00:06:09.954 --> 00:06:11.121
Mmm.

101
00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:12.486
- Oh, no!

102
00:06:12.498 --> 00:06:14.458
- I told you!

103
00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:20.130
Lord Asriel is an eminent
fellow of the college.

104
00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:24.134
And as Master of Jordan,
you must force him...

105
00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:26.053
to abandon his plan.

106
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.514
They're talking
about Uncle Asriel.

107
00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:31.183
I speak for the Magisterium.

108
00:06:31.267 --> 00:06:34.603
The Magisterium has no authority
within these walls.

109
00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:37.439
My dear fellow...

110
00:06:37.523 --> 00:06:40.818
the Magisterium
has authority everywhere...

111
00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.281
and Lord Asriel will be silenced...

112
00:06:45.364 --> 00:06:48.325
one way or another.

113
00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:50.452
That may be.

114
00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:53.414
But while he is at Jordan,
his proposal will be heard.

115
00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:58.460
I'll not dispense with centuries
of tolerance and free inquiry.

116
00:06:58.544 --> 00:07:00.504
And that's my final word
on the matter.

117
00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:03.507
Now, if you'll excuse me...

118
00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:10.639
...| shall call the Council to order.

119
00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:18.677
PANTALAIMON, WHISPERING:
I guess we lost that bet.

120
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:21.150
Hush, Pan.

121
00:07:45.758 --> 00:07:48.719
Lyra, he's leaving. Let's go.

122
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:49.803
Lyra.

123
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:53.795
The professor...
A really hard time.

124
00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:54.933
Oh, no.

125
00:07:55.017 --> 00:07:57.061
- It's Stelmaria.

126
00:08:01.357 --> 00:08:05.527
The Master asked me to decant a bottle
of the '99 Tokay for you, Lord Asriel.

127
00:08:05.611 --> 00:08:07.529
He remembered
you were partial to it.

128
00:08:07.613 --> 00:08:09.448
Thank you.

129
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.177
- Lyra!
- It's poisoned.

130
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.346
- Nonsense.
- It ain't nonsense.

131
00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.598
I saw that man
from the Magisterium...

132
00:08:34.682 --> 00:08:36.684
pour some powder into the wine.

133
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.523
Go back in there.

134
00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:44.166
Keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

135
00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:46.151
Go on.

136
00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:57.413
Ah, Lord Asriel.

137
00:08:57.496 --> 00:08:58.956
This is a rare pleasure.

138
00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:04.169
May I introduce, urn,
Fra Pavel of the Magisterium?

139
00:09:04.253 --> 00:09:09.925
We've never met, but I've followed
your exploits closely, Lord Asriel.

140
00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:11.593
That's what the smell is.

141
00:09:11.677 --> 00:09:14.096
Master, gentlemen, I shall
get straight to the point.

142
00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:15.806
Hunt, the lights.

143
00:09:18.142 --> 00:09:21.437
This photogram was taken
at the magnetic North Pole...

144
00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:25.441
in Svalbard...

145
00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.986
kingdom of the ice bears.

146
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.946
Ice bears, Pan.

147
00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:35.075
Lord Asriel, is that light rising up
from the man's body or coming down'?

148
00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:36.732
Uh, no, that's...
That's coming down from the sky...

149
00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:38.245
but that's not light.

150
00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:43.625
- It's Dust.
- Dust?

151
00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:49.757
What's Dust?

152
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.008
I don't know.

153
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.551
It can't be the normal sort.

154
00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.970
They've got plenty of that here.

155
00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.847
<i>Mirabile dictu, gentlemen.</i>

156
00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.142
Allow Lord Asriel to explain.

157
00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:03.771
Perhaps you've made a mistake.

158
00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:07.232
It could be an aberration
or malfunction of some kind.

159
00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:10.194
No, it is no aberration.

160
00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:14.782
The behavior of these particles
is quite unmistakable.

161
00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:19.411
Dust is flowing into this man
through his daemon...

162
00:10:19.495 --> 00:10:22.164
from a city in another world.

163
00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:26.168
A world much like ours in a parallel
universe coexisting with our own.

164
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.046
Invisible, intangible, inaccessible!

165
00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.535
- Until now.

166
00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:34.218
From there, and from
a billion other worlds, Dust flows.

167
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:36.970
Worlds of infinite possibilities.

168
00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:38.668
Some where men have no daemons.

169
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.349
Some where daemons have no men.

170
00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.976
People without daemons.
That's impossible.

171
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.729
And even some where
there is no Magisterium...

172
00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:49.650
and no Authority.

173
00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:52.110
That is heresy.

174
00:10:52.194 --> 00:10:54.071
That...

175
00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.616
is the truth.

176
00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:02.162
I wouldn't recommend the Tokay,
gentlemen. It's corked.

177
00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:05.374
To discover the source of Dust,
I intend to travel to these worlds.

178
00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:07.876
With a sufficient source
of energy and... ha...

179
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.045
Well, a sufficient source of funds...

180
00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:13.465
...| can effect a crossing.

181
00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:16.510
I humbly beg the College Council
to fund such a journey.

182
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:25.227
It wasn't my fault.
She wouldn't listen to me.

183
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.728
<i>“ ~</i> Oh!

184
00:11:26.812 --> 00:11:30.399
I will not have my niece
slithering round like an alley cat.

185
00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:33.402
You're not very grateful, are you?

186
00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:35.153
I've just saved your life.

187
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.158
Uncle, why did he try
to poison you?

188
00:11:40.242 --> 00:11:41.882
- You wouldn't understand.
- Yes, I would.

189
00:11:41.952 --> 00:11:43.787
Well, I don't see why.

190
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:45.873
Apparently you're
impossible to educate.

191
00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:47.708
A miscreant and a liar.

192
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.838
W... what will the Magisterium
do to you now?

193
00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:55.507
The Magisterium's days
are numbered.

194
00:11:55.591 --> 00:11:57.301
What does that mean?

195
00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:59.636
Trouble, with a bit of luck.

196
00:12:01.013 --> 00:12:02.848
Did you get the money you needed?

197
00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:04.308
Are you going North again?

198
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:07.102
The College Council
has defied the Magisterium.

199
00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.062
I'm leaving immediately.

200
00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:10.606
Can I come with you?

201
00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:12.482
I want to see the ice bears
and glaciers...

202
00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:14.151
and learn about Dust
and everything.

203
00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.320
What do you know about Dust?

204
00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.905
- Nothing.
- Good.

205
00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:19.281
Keep it that way.

206
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.575
Now be a good girl
and do what you're told.

207
00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:23.410
But you don't do what you're told.

208
00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:25.495
You don't let anybody
tell you what to do.

209
00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:27.331
Yes, and look at the welcome I got.

210
00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.836
- Hush, Pan.

211
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.005
I see your daemon
still changes shape.

212
00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.924
Hasn't settled yet.

213
00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:38.508
Yeah.

214
00:12:40.636 --> 00:12:43.096
That's to do with Dust, isn't it?

215
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.057
Why kids' daemons
can change shape...

216
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.017
but grown-ups' daemons can't.

217
00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:50.062
Lyra.

218
00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.272
Dust is none of your business.

219
00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:55.567
Now you try and behave.

220
00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:14.920
My Uncle Asriel said he'd take me to
the North next time he goes. He swore it.

221
00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.618
- 'Cause he needs my help, see.

222
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.965
What for'?

223
00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:20.759
Fightin', probably.

224
00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:22.386
Or spying-

225
00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.388
He uses me as a spy sometimes.

226
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:26.390
Like now, for instance.

227
00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:28.421
I'm supposed to be keeping
an eye on them Gobblers...

228
00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:29.433
Come on!

229
00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.812
...'cause they took them
Gyptian kids up Banbury way.

230
00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:33.271
Billy Costa told me.

231
00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:36.441
I heard them Gobblers
take you down to hell.

232
00:13:36.525 --> 00:13:38.485
Course they don't.

233
00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.697
You're afraid of them, ain't you?

234
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.864
No, I ain't.

235
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:45.742
<i>'</i>
- Urgh!

236
00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:49.162
But the adults are,
because kids keep disappearin'.

237
00:13:49.246 --> 00:13:51.456
They go after the poor kids, see.

238
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.419
The orphans
and the servant kids as well.

239
00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:58.088
Roger, I promise...

240
00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.716
if you was taken by the Gobblers...

241
00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.050
I'd come and rescue you.

242
00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:05.846
You'd come and get me too,
wouldn't you?

243
00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:09.641
Course. But everybody would go
looking for you if you was Gobbled.

244
00:14:09.725 --> 00:14:11.852
- You're a lady.
- Says who'?

245
00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:16.189
Cook. He says that's why your uncle
left you here, to make you a lady.

246
00:14:16.273 --> 00:14:18.025
Nobody can make me a lady.

247
00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:21.903
Not the Master and scholars
and porters combined, right?

248
00:14:21.987 --> 00:14:25.240
Take it back, or we ain't
best mates no more!

249
00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.159
All right, all right,
you ain't a lady.

250
00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:28.910
- Lyra!

251
00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:32.289
Lyra Belacqua,
get down off them roofs!

252
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.915
The Master wants you at high table!

253
00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:35.584
- Ha ha ha.

254
00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.490
- Ha ha ha.
- It was really...

255
00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.463
Really quite surprising.

256
00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.715
The state of your knees.

257
00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.884
And your hair.

258
00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:44.967
Well...

259
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.303
Ow!

260
00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:47.721
It's not surprising.

261
00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.557
Roger and me's
been huntin' Gobblers.

262
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.309
It's dirty work.

263
00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:55.771
'Ere, don't you make jokes
about them Gobblers.

264
00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:58.648
Ain't nothin' to play about
when children go missing.

265
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.620
Lyra, my dear...

266
00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:15.248
the tutor of metaphysics tells me
that you've missed your lesson again.

267
00:15:15.332 --> 00:15:19.211
Now, I know you do not always
understand our need to educate you...

268
00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:23.590
but sometimes you must do
what others think... best.

269
00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:27.469
Ha ha. But I disagree, Master.

270
00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:29.096
Ahem. Mrs. Coulter.

271
00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.100
When I was a young woman...

272
00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:36.186
I knew that no one could ever
really truly understand me...

273
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.396
except, of course, my daemon...

274
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.525
and that it would be best
if we were free to do as we pleased.

275
00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:44.194
Hm?

276
00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:48.490
Sit down, gentlemen.

277
00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:51.034
- Who's she?
- Don't know.

278
00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:53.411
Hm. But she shut up
the Master, all right.

279
00:15:53.495 --> 00:16:00.085
Urn, uh, Mrs. Coulter? This is our Lyra,
Lyra Belacqua, Lord Asriel's niece.

280
00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:02.587
Lyra, this is Mrs. Coulter...

281
00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.965
a friend of the college.

282
00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:09.469
Lovely to meet you.

283
00:16:09.553 --> 00:16:12.347
Lovely to meet you too.

284
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.225
Do you know I've met Lord Asriel?

285
00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:18.895
Mm. It was at
the Royal Arctic Institute.

286
00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:20.856
We discussed
the political structure...

287
00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.316
of the ice bears of Svalbard.

288
00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.069
You've seen an ice bear?

289
00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.071
As a matter of fact...

290
00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:30.740
I have had an audience
with the bear king himself...

291
00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.325
Ragnar Sturlusson.

292
00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:34.995
And I'll tell you something
I probably shouldn't...

293
00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:40.000
King Ragnar is desperate
to have a daemon of his own.

294
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:45.130
Ha ha ha. Bears don't have them,
you see, and, uh, Ragnar...

295
00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.674
he likes to think of himself
as a person...

296
00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:50.552
and he will stop at nothing to get one.

297
00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:54.139
But you mustn't repeat that.

298
00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.932
Oh, I'd never.

299
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.229
You know, if eel I can trust you.

300
00:17:01.313 --> 00:17:02.856
Mm.

301
00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.403
I have to go back
to the North very soon.

302
00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.447
I'm going to need an assistant.

303
00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:13.366
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

304
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.450
Go to the North?

305
00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:15.492
North?

306
00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:16.953
It's cold up there.

307
00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.539
We'd better get
the Master's permission.

308
00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:24.211
"Master-ahem" I was wondering...

309
00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:26.796
if I might borrow dear Lyra.

310
00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:30.508
Only for a while, of course.

311
00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:33.833
I'm not sure
that would be consistent with...

312
00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:36.306
Lord Asriel's wishes
for her education.

313
00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:41.102
Ha ha. Let me deal with Asriel.

314
00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:44.564
You mustn't deny me
this little thing, you really mustn't.

315
00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:54.574
Very well.

316
00:17:58.078 --> 00:17:59.996
Yeah, uh... ha ha.

317
00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.416
Yeah, uh... ah.

318
00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:12.092
A bet's a bet...

319
00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.844
and Lyra was supposed
to show up with the gown.

320
00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:17.264
I told you they wouldn't
let her out of the college.

321
00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:18.848
Which one's her room?

322
00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:20.433
What are you gonna do?

323
00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:22.310
Give her a fright, that's all.

324
00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:25.063
We get caught,
I'll be skinned alive.

325
00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:28.108
Night porter's bound
to be doin' his rounds.

326
00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:30.277
Ratter, check if the coast is clear.

327
00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:44.958
It's all clear.

328
00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:50.297
- Billy!

329
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.966
- Billy!

330
00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:04.644
The scholars still refuse
to hand over the last alethiometer...

331
00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:08.898
and now they've given Asriel
all the funds he needs.

332
00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:13.236
If he succeeds in proving
the existence of these other worlds...

333
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.073
it will contradict
centuries of teaching.

334
00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:21.286
There will always be
freethinkers and heretics...

335
00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:26.082
unless we deal
with the root of the problem.

336
00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:29.002
That is why Mrs. Coulter's work
is so important.

337
00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:32.630
What progress has she made?

338
00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:35.759
The doctors at Bolvangar...

339
00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:38.928
are close to perfecting
the inoculation...

340
00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:42.932
against the effects of Dust.

341
00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:46.186
I am relieved to hear that.

342
00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:50.440
If we can protect our children
from the corrupting influence of Dust...

343
00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:53.193
before their daemons settle...

344
00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:57.447
then we will nurture a generation
at peace with itself...

345
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.284
one that will never question
our authority again.

346
00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:05.413
We owe it to the young...

347
00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:08.291
do we not?

348
00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.714
I fear our defiance
will not go unpunished...

349
00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:21.471
now she'll be drawn into it.

350
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:22.555
We've failed her.

351
00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:27.060
We've protected her
as long as we could, Master.

352
00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:28.645
And she's still only a child.

353
00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.480
She can't possibly be
a threat to them.

354
00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.399
She is.

355
00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:36.069
She's meant to play
a major part in what is to come.

356
00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:39.406
How can you know such things?

357
00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.076
The witches.

358
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:49.582
Thank you. Um, could you...

359
00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:52.502
Could you stay
by the door, Mrs. Lonsdale?

360
00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:55.088
It's important that I know
if I was followed.

361
00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:57.132
Why yes, Master.

362
00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:05.473
It's for you, Lyra.

363
00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:06.975
What is this?

364
00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.935
An alethiometer.

365
00:21:09.018 --> 00:21:13.148
Also known as a golden compass.

366
00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:19.988
It was given to the college
by Lord Asriel many years ago.

367
00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:23.450
And now I'm giving it to you.

368
00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:26.369
I feel you are meant to have it.

369
00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:28.746
What's it for?

370
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.626
It tells the truth.

371
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.045
We've always tried
to acquaint you with the truth.

372
00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:39.048
But the secrets at the heart
of things elude scholars...

373
00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.176
and, uh, Authorities.

374
00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:45.013
But this lets you
glimpse things as they are.

375
00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:50.226
But, Lyra,
keep the alethiometer to yourself.

376
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.630
It is of the utmost importance...

377
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.980
that Mrs. Coulter does not
know that you have it.

378
00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:55.064
Do you understand me?

379
00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:57.150
Of the utmost importance.

380
00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:02.989
Lyra.

381
00:22:03.072 --> 00:22:05.200
Ha ha. Are you ready?

382
00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.369
There's someone missing.

383
00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:10.538
I want to say goodbye to Roger.

384
00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:14.167
Roger? Who's Roger?

385
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.753
My friend.
He works in the kitchens.

386
00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:20.715
We must go.
The ferry's about to take off.

387
00:22:22.383 --> 00:22:24.010
Why don't you write him a letter?

388
00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:26.262
You can tell him all
about the journey, and...

389
00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:27.931
you can even send him a photogram.

390
00:22:28.014 --> 00:22:29.170
- Madam.
- What do you think?

391
00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:31.267
Yeah. I suppose.

392
00:23:02.882 --> 00:23:05.510
- Anything else, madam?
- That'll be all.

393
00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:11.182
Mrs. Coulter, what's that?

394
00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:16.020
Ah. That is the magisterial seat, Lyra.

395
00:23:16.104 --> 00:23:17.939
Oh.

396
00:23:18.022 --> 00:23:20.525
What's the Magisterium for?

397
00:23:20.608 --> 00:23:23.736
Oh, you have been living
in an ivory tower, haven't you?

398
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.156
The Magisterium
is what people need.

399
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.491
- Mm?

400
00:23:28.575 --> 00:23:32.245
They keep things working
by telling people what to do.

401
00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:36.291
But... you told the Master
you did whatever you pleased.

402
00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:38.376
Ah. Ha ha ha.

403
00:23:38.459 --> 00:23:41.504
That's right. Clever girl.

404
00:23:41.588 --> 00:23:45.091
Well, some people know
what's best for them...

405
00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:46.634
and some people don't.

406
00:23:47.343 --> 00:23:49.345
Besides, they don't tell
people what to do...

407
00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:50.680
in a mean, petty way...

408
00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:52.974
they tell them what
to do in a kindly way...

409
00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:55.518
to keep them out of danger.

410
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.271
Sugar'?

411
00:24:35.433 --> 00:24:37.393
- Hee hee hee.
- Ha ha ha.

412
00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:59.082
Look, Pan, it's got
loads of pictures round the edge.

413
00:24:59.165 --> 00:25:00.833
PANTALAIMON:
But what do they all mean?

414
00:25:00.917 --> 00:25:02.752
Don't know.

415
00:25:04.671 --> 00:25:08.716
The needle keeps stopping
at the same symbols...

416
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.593
Lady“.

417
00:25:10.677 --> 00:25:12.428
Lightning bolt...

418
00:25:12.512 --> 00:25:14.597
and the baby.

419
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:17.934
Then it goes back
and does it again. See'?

420
00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:20.687
What do you think
makes the needle move?

421
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.148
I don't know.
Maybe Uncle Asriel knows.

422
00:25:26.192 --> 00:25:28.778
Maybe we're supposed
to take it to him.

423
00:25:33.533 --> 00:25:35.493
All washed and ready for bed?

424
00:25:37.495 --> 00:25:39.247
We have a busy few weeks.

425
00:25:57.223 --> 00:26:00.309
Well, it was
a stylish enough party...

426
00:26:00.393 --> 00:26:02.895
but why they don't offer
more ice with their drinks...

427
00:26:02.979 --> 00:26:04.814
I shall never understand.

428
00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:07.150
I'll only be a moment, darling.

429
00:26:07.233 --> 00:26:08.735
Official business.

430
00:26:09.736 --> 00:26:11.112
Ha!

431
00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:13.990
What?

432
00:26:14.073 --> 00:26:17.326
She likes to show off
her new pet, doesn't she?

433
00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.912
She's never taking us to the North.

434
00:26:19.996 --> 00:26:22.957
We're like prisoners in this house.
All these rules, and rooms that...

435
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.667
- we aren't allowed into.

436
00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:31.132
Hmm, perhaps we shouldn't have
invited Professor Docker.

437
00:26:31.215 --> 00:26:33.009
He's such a bore, isn't he?

438
00:26:33.092 --> 00:26:35.011
And he had sauce in his beard.

439
00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:37.138
Ha ha ha ha.

440
00:26:38.556 --> 00:26:42.268
But he is one of the foremost
experts on particle metaphysics.

441
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:45.730
Have I taught you
what a particle is?

442
00:26:45.813 --> 00:26:47.982
Oh, I know about particles.

443
00:26:48.065 --> 00:26:49.192
Like Dust.

444
00:26:49.275 --> 00:26:51.527
- That's a particle, isn't it?

445
00:26:52.695 --> 00:26:54.113
Dust?

446
00:26:54.197 --> 00:26:56.282
I mean the Dust from space.

447
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:58.534
That Dust, like in the North.

448
00:26:58.618 --> 00:27:00.495
Uh, w... where did you
hear about that?

449
00:27:02.288 --> 00:27:04.332
It must have been
one of the scholars at Jordan.

450
00:27:08.211 --> 00:27:11.547
Oh, a wise person knows, Lyra...

451
00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:13.800
that there are some things
that we best ignore...

452
00:27:13.883 --> 00:27:17.887
subjects that you...
Well, you never speak about.

453
00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:21.390
- But I didn't...
- Yes.

454
00:27:21.474 --> 00:27:24.352
You didn't know, so I forgive you.

455
00:27:24.435 --> 00:27:26.187
Just don't mention it again.

456
00:27:28.231 --> 00:27:29.649
Now, darling...

457
00:27:29.732 --> 00:27:32.819
will you take off that
childish shoulder bag?

458
00:27:32.902 --> 00:27:35.279
I don't like to see you
wearing it indoors.

459
00:27:37.698 --> 00:27:39.534
Please, Mrs. Coulter.

460
00:27:40.618 --> 00:27:42.119
I do love it.

461
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.372
But I do not.

462
00:27:48.042 --> 00:27:49.752
Put it away.

463
00:27:52.338 --> 00:27:53.714
Hm.

464
00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:55.883
Lyra, put it away now.

465
00:27:55.967 --> 00:27:57.552
I don't want to.

466
00:27:58.594 --> 00:28:00.721
- If you do not obey me...

467
00:28:00.805 --> 00:28:02.445
we will have an argument
which I will win.

468
00:28:02.515 --> 00:28:04.392
Now put it away at once.

469
00:28:04.475 --> 00:28:07.103
It's absurd to be carrying
around a shoulder bag...

470
00:28:07.186 --> 00:28:09.105
in your own home.

471
00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:11.023
Jordan is my home.

472
00:28:13.442 --> 00:28:15.111
No! Lyra!

473
00:28:16.487 --> 00:28:18.948
Don't. Please, it hurts!

474
00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:20.241
Lyra!

475
00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:22.410
Lyra!

476
00:28:22.493 --> 00:28:23.953
Will you do as I tell you?

477
00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:25.246
I promise.

478
00:28:29.834 --> 00:28:31.377
- Lyra.

479
00:28:32.879 --> 00:28:34.630
Thank you.

480
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:38.873
And while you're at it, you must
learn to control your daemon.

481
00:28:38.885 --> 00:28:40.636
He's much too wild.

482
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.930
Now...

483
00:28:43.014 --> 00:28:45.099
Kiss me.

484
00:28:48.352 --> 00:28:49.478
I hate her!

485
00:28:51.063 --> 00:28:52.940
I hate them!

486
00:28:53.024 --> 00:28:54.317
And look.

487
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.235
They're spying on us.

488
00:29:01.908 --> 00:29:04.076
What do they want with us?

489
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.078
Why are we here?

490
00:29:06.162 --> 00:29:07.663
Did you see her daemon?

491
00:29:07.747 --> 00:29:10.291
He went all sharp
when you mentioned Dust.

492
00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:12.668
And what does she keep
in that room?

493
00:29:12.752 --> 00:29:14.420
Let's go find out.

494
00:29:30.144 --> 00:29:32.772
PANTALAIMON, WHISPERING:
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

495
00:29:39.236 --> 00:29:40.947
Over here.

496
00:29:50.373 --> 00:29:51.874
Look.

497
00:29:57.171 --> 00:29:59.548
That's just one of
her stupid guest lists.

498
00:29:59.632 --> 00:30:00.883
No, it isn't.

499
00:30:00.967 --> 00:30:02.677
Look at it.

500
00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:09.600
"Inter.. cision."

501
00:30:10.476 --> 00:30:12.520
W... what does it mean, Pan?

502
00:30:12.603 --> 00:30:13.603
And that...

503
00:30:13.646 --> 00:30:17.024
"General... Oblation Board."

504
00:30:17.108 --> 00:30:19.694
G... O... B.

505
00:30:21.278 --> 00:30:23.114
Gobblers.

506
00:30:23.197 --> 00:30:26.325
From the letters, G... O... B.

507
00:30:28.411 --> 00:30:32.581
"Workman, Edwards, Parslow, Costa!"

508
00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:34.166
Billy and Roger!

509
00:30:37.253 --> 00:30:39.714
Pan, it's her.
She's running the Gobblers.

510
00:30:39.797 --> 00:30:41.257
Lyra, where are you?

511
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.009
We have to get out of here.

512
00:30:45.469 --> 00:30:47.221
Lyr...

513
00:30:47.304 --> 00:30:48.597
Lyra.

514
00:30:48.681 --> 00:30:50.099
What have you been doing?

515
00:30:50.182 --> 00:30:51.267
Nothing.

516
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.102
Well, we must find
something for you to do.

517
00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:56.147
Shall you help me
arrange our passage to Norroway?

518
00:30:58.149 --> 00:31:01.527
Oh, you do want to come
to the North with me, don't you?

519
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.779
Where is he? I don't see him.

520
00:31:13.998 --> 00:31:16.208
- Lyra. this Way!

521
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.712
Quick, Lyra!

522
00:31:21.672 --> 00:31:23.299
Ah!

523
00:31:24.008 --> 00:31:25.008
Lyra!

524
00:31:25.051 --> 00:31:26.177
Oh!

525
00:31:32.725 --> 00:31:34.935
What are we gonna do, Pan?

526
00:31:35.019 --> 00:31:37.938
We've got to save Roger...
and Billy.

527
00:31:38.022 --> 00:31:39.815
We've got
to save ourselves first!

528
00:31:39.899 --> 00:31:41.067
Where are we gonna go?

529
00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.985
Anywhere's better than here.

530
00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:46.989
Come on! This way!

531
00:31:51.619 --> 00:31:54.019
All right, then.
Split up. The girl can't be far.

532
00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:56.791
Spread out.
Search all the buildings.

533
00:31:56.874 --> 00:31:58.030
PANTALAIMON WHISPERS I Gobblers!

534
00:31:58.042 --> 00:31:59.919
You, cover the canal.

535
00:32:01.879 --> 00:32:04.090
THIRD MAN:
She's gotta be here somewhere.

536
00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:14.308
Wait up, Johnny!

537
00:32:14.391 --> 00:32:16.185
SECOND MAN:
Put your back into it!

538
00:32:16.268 --> 00:32:17.788
THIRD MAN:
We'll need two more of them.

539
00:32:18.729 --> 00:32:22.316
Come on, lovely, lovely
and fresh. Lovely and fresh.

540
00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:25.861
Hurry!

541
00:32:29.532 --> 00:32:30.950
Get her!

542
00:32:31.033 --> 00:32:32.284
Get it!

543
00:32:35.913 --> 00:32:37.373
Pan!

544
00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:39.166
Hurry, Lyra!

545
00:32:44.922 --> 00:32:46.882
Ah! Lyra!

546
00:32:48.217 --> 00:32:49.217
Hold her!

547
00:32:51.387 --> 00:32:53.139
- NO!

548
00:32:56.809 --> 00:32:58.602
- Ohh!

549
00:33:06.152 --> 00:33:07.152
Lyra!

550
00:33:07.194 --> 00:33:08.946
Pan.

551
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:11.031
Gyptians.

552
00:33:15.703 --> 00:33:17.454
Don't fret none, Lyra.

553
00:33:18.664 --> 00:33:19.915
Come 'ere.

554
00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:24.295
You're safe with us.

555
00:33:24.378 --> 00:33:25.588
You're Ma Costa.

556
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:27.798
- Billy's mum.

557
00:33:29.341 --> 00:33:30.759
But what are you doing here?

558
00:33:30.843 --> 00:33:32.094
We been in your shadow...

559
00:33:32.178 --> 00:33:35.431
ever since you left
Jordan College, watchin' over you.

560
00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:37.933
And a good thing too.

561
00:33:38.017 --> 00:33:40.060
You best come with us.

562
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.509
- Hurry, lads.

563
00:33:42.521 --> 00:33:44.064
Where are we going?

564
00:33:44.148 --> 00:33:46.817
To see Lord Faa,
King of the Gyptians.

565
00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:49.153
SECOND MAN:
Come on, get yourself aboard.

566
00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:37.576
PANTALAIMON:
Not very friendly, are they?

567
00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.453
What are you lookin' at?

568
00:34:45.292 --> 00:34:46.919
So now all the clans are here...

569
00:34:47.002 --> 00:34:49.755
we'll head North on the next tide.

570
00:34:51.548 --> 00:34:52.675
Ma Costa.

571
00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:56.679
This is the child?

572
00:34:58.681 --> 00:35:01.100
It's all right.

573
00:35:04.979 --> 00:35:06.355
How do you do, Lord Faa?

574
00:35:09.942 --> 00:35:11.735
Hello, Lyra.

575
00:35:13.237 --> 00:35:14.989
You come and sit by my side.

576
00:35:15.072 --> 00:35:16.832
MAN, OUTSIDE:
Right, boys, get your heads up!

577
00:35:17.283 --> 00:35:19.410
This is Farder Coram.

578
00:35:19.493 --> 00:35:21.453
MAN, OUTSIDE:
Head for the ice lake!

579
00:35:21.537 --> 00:35:25.457
And these are the chiefs
of the Gyptian families.

580
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:29.003
You are our guest here,
and you're under our protection.

581
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.213
Lord Faa...

582
00:35:32.298 --> 00:35:33.674
I want to thank you.

583
00:35:33.757 --> 00:35:36.427
For keeping watch on me and all.

584
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.762
But why did you do it?

585
00:35:38.846 --> 00:35:42.057
Lord Asriel has been
a good friend to the Gyptians...

586
00:35:42.141 --> 00:35:46.520
this many a year, and this many
a year it has been our charge...

587
00:35:46.603 --> 00:35:50.441
to bring him news of you
as we travel along our ways.

588
00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:53.652
Bet you didn't know that, did you?

589
00:35:54.945 --> 00:36:00.242
And when Mrs. Coulter
got a hold of you, well...

590
00:36:00.326 --> 00:36:03.579
we suspected that she had
something to do with the Gobblers.

591
00:36:03.662 --> 00:36:06.165
And she did.

592
00:36:06.248 --> 00:36:09.626
She and them Gobblers
took my little boy Billy.

593
00:36:11.086 --> 00:36:12.921
Lyra.

594
00:36:13.005 --> 00:36:15.257
We know your tale
all the way up until...

595
00:36:15.341 --> 00:36:18.260
you run away
and the Costas found you.

596
00:36:18.344 --> 00:36:21.764
But is there anything else
you can tell us?

597
00:36:21.847 --> 00:36:24.767
Is there anything
you may have forgot?

598
00:36:25.726 --> 00:36:27.436
Don't show it to them.

599
00:36:29.438 --> 00:36:31.815
The Master of Jordan gave me this.

600
00:36:34.234 --> 00:36:37.988
I thought they was
all taken by the Magisterium.

601
00:36:43.202 --> 00:36:45.037
It's an alethiometer.

602
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.122
It's a truth measurer.

603
00:36:47.206 --> 00:36:49.541
A golden compass.

604
00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:54.213
It enables you to see
what others wish to hide.

605
00:36:54.296 --> 00:36:58.133
You got three hands
you can control.

606
00:36:58.217 --> 00:37:01.637
By pointing at three symbols...

607
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.391
you can ask any sort of question
you can imagine.

608
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:08.977
Once you got your question framed...

609
00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:12.272
this blue needle points
to more symbols...

610
00:37:12.356 --> 00:37:14.233
that give you the answer.

611
00:37:14.316 --> 00:37:16.819
Could it be used
to find the missing children?

612
00:37:16.902 --> 00:37:18.404
Not by me.

613
00:37:18.487 --> 00:37:20.280
The art was jealously guarded.

614
00:37:20.364 --> 00:37:21.364
Can I try?

615
00:37:21.407 --> 00:37:23.450
Ha ha ha.

616
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.660
All right.

617
00:37:25.702 --> 00:37:27.162
What are you doing, Lyra?

618
00:37:27.246 --> 00:37:28.497
You don't know how to read it.

619
00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.249
Hush, Pan.

620
00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:37.339
Well, the serpent is cunning,
like the Gobblers.

621
00:37:37.423 --> 00:37:41.009
And... the pot could mean
a recipe or a plan.

622
00:37:41.093 --> 00:37:42.928
And...

623
00:37:43.011 --> 00:37:44.430
the baby...

624
00:37:44.513 --> 00:37:47.015
that means kids.

625
00:37:47.099 --> 00:37:48.851
FARDER CORAM:
One thing I do know, Lyra...

626
00:37:48.934 --> 00:37:52.062
you mustn't grasp at the answer.

627
00:37:52.146 --> 00:37:55.816
Hold the question
in your mind, but lightly.

628
00:37:55.899 --> 00:37:58.485
Li... like it was something alive.

629
00:38:10.998 --> 00:38:14.793
[Whooshing sounds,
echoing voices]

630
00:38:28.474 --> 00:38:30.893
It's an hourglass.

631
00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:34.146
But it came round to it
on the second time.

632
00:38:34.229 --> 00:38:37.649
The first time it only
stopped there a moment.

633
00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:41.695
On top of the hourglass...

634
00:38:41.778 --> 00:38:43.489
there's a skull.

635
00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:52.915
Thank you, children.
Finish your letters now.

636
00:39:01.632 --> 00:39:05.594
Billy Costa,
why didn't you write anything?

637
00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:07.513
Your mother must be
missing you terribly.

638
00:39:09.014 --> 00:39:12.059
I don't know what to put
in the letter, miss.

639
00:39:12.142 --> 00:39:13.936
You haven't told us
what we're here for.

640
00:39:14.019 --> 00:39:16.271
You're here to help us.

641
00:39:16.355 --> 00:39:19.942
And just as soon as you've helped us,
we'll send you back home.

642
00:39:20.943 --> 00:39:22.528
That's what you should write.

643
00:39:22.611 --> 00:39:25.197
Or don't they teach
Gyptian children to write?

644
00:39:25.989 --> 00:39:28.825
They teach us
to write the truth, miss.

645
00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:32.538
Billy, just write the letter.

646
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:36.625
Well, as I'll be posting
these straight away...

647
00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:39.378
I'm afraid your parents
will be disappointed.

648
00:39:47.469 --> 00:39:51.640
I confess I am puzzled
by your interest in the Belacqua girl.

649
00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:55.143
Ah! For one thing, she is
in possession of the alethiometer.

650
00:39:55.227 --> 00:39:58.063
How...? Ah, yes. The Master.

651
00:40:01.358 --> 00:40:02.526
Can she read it?

652
00:40:03.068 --> 00:40:05.195
Of course not.

653
00:40:05.279 --> 00:40:07.155
Mrs. Coulter...

654
00:40:07.239 --> 00:40:09.908
are you familiar with
the prophesies of the witches?

655
00:40:09.992 --> 00:40:12.578
You think she is that child?

656
00:40:13.537 --> 00:40:14.538
Impossible.

657
00:40:15.747 --> 00:40:18.083
Nonetheless, she must be found.

658
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:28.343
Ha ha. They'll seek her out
like bees to honey.

659
00:41:01.585 --> 00:41:03.170
Svalbard.

660
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.465
Kingdom of the ice bears.

661
00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:09.384
Heh.

662
00:41:09.468 --> 00:41:12.554
We shall have
to watch ourselves, Stelmaria.

663
00:41:12.638 --> 00:41:14.127
You can bet
that Coulter woman has hired...

664
00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:17.768
every Samoyed bandit from here
to the Pole to hunt us down.

665
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:53.011
- Aargh!

666
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:00.936
Aaah!

667
00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:03.438
A a a a ah!

668
00:42:25.961 --> 00:42:27.546
Let's not be s... so hasty.

669
00:42:27.629 --> 00:42:28.868
- Why don't we just...

670
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.882
We can work this out
like gentlemen.

671
00:43:00.912 --> 00:43:02.664
Don't worry, Lyra.

672
00:43:02.748 --> 00:43:04.416
We'll find Roger.

673
00:43:37.491 --> 00:43:39.075
I'm all right.

674
00:43:41.244 --> 00:43:42.537
What is it?

675
00:43:42.621 --> 00:43:44.289
It's a spy-W.

676
00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:45.791
Is it dangerous?

677
00:43:45.874 --> 00:43:47.125
Oh!

678
00:43:47.209 --> 00:43:49.878
The one that got away is.

679
00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:52.255
If you was to crack it open...

680
00:43:52.339 --> 00:43:54.883
you'd find no living thing in there.

681
00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:57.385
N... no animal or insect, at any rate.

682
00:43:57.469 --> 00:43:59.346
There's a clockwork...

683
00:43:59.429 --> 00:44:03.225
and pinned to the spring of it
is a bad spirit...

684
00:44:03.308 --> 00:44:06.102
with a sleeping poison in its sting.

685
00:44:07.312 --> 00:44:10.065
We'll keep him safe in here.

686
00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:13.860
What was it after?

687
00:44:13.944 --> 00:44:15.862
- You, Lyra.
- Why me'?

688
00:44:15.946 --> 00:44:17.697
Why are they doing this?

689
00:44:17.781 --> 00:44:19.491
We don't know.

690
00:44:19.574 --> 00:44:21.326
But we Gyptians...

691
00:44:21.409 --> 00:44:23.245
have been hurt worse than most...

692
00:44:23.328 --> 00:44:25.080
- by these Gobblers...

693
00:44:25.163 --> 00:44:28.041
...these child-thieves.

694
00:44:28.124 --> 00:44:30.585
They're takin' those children up North...

695
00:44:30.669 --> 00:44:33.755
the land of cold and dark...

696
00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:37.425
and what they're doing
with them there, we don't know...

697
00:44:37.509 --> 00:44:40.220
but we have heard terrible rumor.

698
00:44:42.305 --> 00:44:44.099
Our aim...

699
00:44:44.182 --> 00:44:47.853
is first to go North
and to rescue these children...

700
00:44:47.936 --> 00:44:51.231
both Gyptian and landloper alike.

701
00:44:54.401 --> 00:44:58.572
But if they have been harmed...

702
00:44:58.655 --> 00:45:00.657
I promise you...

703
00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.577
if they have been harmed...

704
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:08.123
there is not a place
nor on land nor on sea...

705
00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:09.916
for these Gobblers.

706
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.919
And when the time comes to punish...

707
00:45:13.003 --> 00:45:19.092
we will strike such a blow as'll make
their hearts faint and fearful.

708
00:45:19.175 --> 00:45:20.206
- Yes!

709
00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:23.638
We will strike the strength
out of them.

710
00:45:23.722 --> 00:45:28.476
We will leave them
broken and shattered.

711
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.603
- Yes!

712
00:45:46.328 --> 00:45:48.246
Are you getting scared, Pan?

713
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:50.081
Scared?

714
00:45:50.165 --> 00:45:51.666
A little.

715
00:45:53.001 --> 00:45:55.670
It's all bigger and scarier
than we ever thought.

716
00:45:55.754 --> 00:45:58.840
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

717
00:45:58.924 --> 00:46:02.469
But we've got to, though, ain't we?

718
00:46:02.552 --> 00:46:04.387
Go on, I mean.

719
00:46:12.395 --> 00:46:14.272
Who are you?

720
00:46:15.315 --> 00:46:17.567
My name is Serafina Pekkala...

721
00:46:17.651 --> 00:46:20.403
clan-queen of the witches
of Lake Enara.

722
00:46:20.487 --> 00:46:21.780
A Witch?

723
00:46:21.863 --> 00:46:23.823
Where's your daemon?

724
00:46:23.907 --> 00:46:26.952
Kaisa can fly a long way from me.

725
00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:30.455
Are you the girl
the Magisterium seeks?

726
00:46:30.538 --> 00:46:32.499
The one with a symbol reader?

727
00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:39.381
Let me see you read it.

728
00:46:39.464 --> 00:46:41.633
I want to know
if you can tell me...

729
00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:45.011
which of the men
on this ship was once...

730
00:46:45.095 --> 00:46:46.513
my lover.

731
00:47:15.458 --> 00:47:16.751
Farder Coram?

732
00:47:17.794 --> 00:47:18.962
But...

733
00:47:19.045 --> 00:47:21.589
He was young and beautiful once.

734
00:47:21.673 --> 00:47:25.010
And we witches live
for hundreds of years.

735
00:47:25.093 --> 00:47:26.886
Farder Coram wishes to know...

736
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:29.389
where the child-cutters
take their prey.

737
00:47:29.472 --> 00:47:32.058
It is a place...

738
00:47:32.142 --> 00:47:34.269
they call Bolvangar.

739
00:47:34.352 --> 00:47:36.062
The place of fear.

740
00:47:36.146 --> 00:47:39.858
A regiment of Tartars
with wolf daemons guards it.

741
00:47:39.941 --> 00:47:42.027
Birds do not fly above.

742
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.528
Animals have fled.

743
00:47:43.611 --> 00:47:46.239
Even the Samoyeds fear it.

744
00:47:47.782 --> 00:47:51.745
It is a week's march from Trollesund,
on the coast of Norroway.

745
00:47:51.828 --> 00:47:54.789
You will find something
to help you in Trollesund.

746
00:47:54.873 --> 00:47:57.167
You will need all your courage.

747
00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:01.921
I'm glad I've lived long enough
to see you...

748
00:48:03.048 --> 00:48:04.758
child.

749
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:47.092
Who's going to help us?

750
00:48:47.175 --> 00:48:49.177
Can you see anything?

751
00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.763
Lyra, you're not listening to me.

752
00:49:04.067 --> 00:49:06.653
That's a mighty fancy
clockwork you got there.

753
00:49:09.155 --> 00:49:10.824
It's just a toy.

754
00:49:10.907 --> 00:49:12.575
Uh-huh?

755
00:49:12.659 --> 00:49:15.203
Well, then,
it's a mighty fancy toy.

756
00:49:19.124 --> 00:49:20.959
How'd you come by somethin' like that?

757
00:49:21.042 --> 00:49:25.255
Oh, Lord. Lee, when you gonna learn
to mind your own business?

758
00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:28.049
I do beg pardon.

759
00:49:28.133 --> 00:49:29.717
Lee Scoresby.

760
00:49:29.801 --> 00:49:31.427
And this old gal is Hester.

761
00:49:32.804 --> 00:49:35.181
I'm Lyra. And this is Pan.

762
00:49:35.265 --> 00:49:36.558
Pantalaimon.

763
00:49:36.641 --> 00:49:39.310
- Howdy.
- Mighty pleased, Miss Lyra.

764
00:49:40.353 --> 00:49:42.397
You rode in with them Gyptian fellers.

765
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.815
- Am I right?

766
00:49:43.898 --> 00:49:45.984
- Whoa, boy.
- There I go again.

767
00:49:46.067 --> 00:49:47.402
Don't answer that.

768
00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:50.905
What are you doing
in Trollesund, Mr. Scoresby'?

769
00:49:50.989 --> 00:49:54.492
Oh, a friend of mine
got himself in a fix.

770
00:49:54.576 --> 00:49:56.828
So I come to see
what I could do about it.

771
00:49:56.911 --> 00:49:58.329
Me too.

772
00:49:58.413 --> 00:50:00.582
Course, that ain't
my normal occupation.

773
00:50:00.665 --> 00:50:05.003
Most of the time,
I ply my trade up in the sky.

774
00:50:06.087 --> 00:50:07.547
You're an aeronaut!

775
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:10.925
Can I go up in your ship?

776
00:50:11.009 --> 00:50:13.178
Ha ha, I'd be honored.

777
00:50:13.261 --> 00:50:15.263
Just as soon as
I get her out of hock.

778
00:50:17.557 --> 00:50:19.017
Miss Lyra...

779
00:50:20.059 --> 00:50:22.187
I'd like to give you
a word of advice...

780
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:24.814
though you ain't asked for none.

781
00:50:24.898 --> 00:50:27.609
If I was on the kinda... scout...

782
00:50:27.692 --> 00:50:30.195
that I reckon you're on...

783
00:50:30.278 --> 00:50:33.489
I'd hire myself an aeronaut...

784
00:50:33.573 --> 00:50:35.116
and an armoured bear.

785
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.285
An armoured bear?

786
00:50:37.368 --> 00:50:39.829
There's one in town.

787
00:50:39.913 --> 00:50:42.207
Lorek Byrnison's his name.

788
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:45.793
Works at the sled depot
behind Einarsson's bar.

789
00:50:45.877 --> 00:50:48.588
Good one to have
on your side in a scrap.

790
00:50:49.714 --> 00:50:51.549
Not that you're lookin' for that.

791
00:51:03.061 --> 00:51:04.812
Lorek Byrnison?

792
00:51:04.896 --> 00:51:06.648
Lorek Byrnison?

793
00:51:06.731 --> 00:51:10.068
- May I speak to you?

794
00:51:12.195 --> 00:51:13.238
What?

795
00:51:13.321 --> 00:51:15.615
We want to offer you employment.

796
00:51:15.698 --> 00:51:19.911
I am employed, by the townspeople.

797
00:51:19.994 --> 00:51:22.497
I mend broken machinery.

798
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.500
I lift heavy objects.

799
00:51:25.583 --> 00:51:29.003
What kind of work is that
for a Panserbjzrn?

800
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:32.799
Paid work!

801
00:51:53.945 --> 00:51:56.072
Is that what they pay you?

802
00:51:56.155 --> 00:51:57.448
Whisky?

803
00:51:59.117 --> 00:52:00.368
Lorek Byrnison...

804
00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:03.663
you're the first ice bear I ever met.

805
00:52:04.914 --> 00:52:07.375
I was ever so excited,
and scared.

806
00:52:08.584 --> 00:52:10.795
But now I'm just disappointed.

807
00:52:10.878 --> 00:52:13.631
I heard that bears
lived to hunt and to fight.

808
00:52:14.799 --> 00:52:16.801
Why are you
wasting your time here...

809
00:52:16.884 --> 00:52:18.344
drinking whisky?

810
00:52:20.179 --> 00:52:24.142
I stay because
the people of this town...

811
00:52:24.225 --> 00:52:25.727
gave me spirits...

812
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.563
and let me drink till I was asleep.

813
00:52:28.646 --> 00:52:31.399
Then they took my arm our away.

814
00:52:31.482 --> 00:52:34.652
And without my arm our,
I cannot go to war.

815
00:52:34.736 --> 00:52:38.614
And I am an armoured bear.

816
00:52:38.698 --> 00:52:42.076
War is the sea I swim in...

817
00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.871
the air I breathe.

818
00:52:44.954 --> 00:52:48.708
Without my arm our, I am nothing.

819
00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:52.712
But... can't you make new arm our?

820
00:52:52.795 --> 00:52:55.798
I thought bears were good at that.

821
00:52:55.882 --> 00:52:57.717
There's all this metal around.

822
00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.761
Worthless!

823
00:53:01.512 --> 00:53:04.599
My arm our is made of sky iron...

824
00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:08.603
from the falling stars
that land in Svalbard.

825
00:53:08.686 --> 00:53:12.106
A bear's arm our is his soul...

826
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:15.109
as your daemon is your soul.

827
00:53:15.193 --> 00:53:16.736
Irreplaceable.

828
00:53:16.819 --> 00:53:20.323
You may as well take him away
and replace him with a doll.

829
00:53:22.116 --> 00:53:25.411
It must have been terrible
to lose your arm our.

830
00:53:25.495 --> 00:53:28.414
It was no less than I deserved.

831
00:53:29.582 --> 00:53:31.417
I am an exile.

832
00:53:31.501 --> 00:53:36.464
I was sent away from Svalbard
because I was unworthy.

833
00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:39.801
I fought another bear
in single combat...

834
00:53:39.884 --> 00:53:42.595
and was defeated.

835
00:53:51.062 --> 00:53:53.439
- Come, child.
- But, Farder Coram...

836
00:53:53.523 --> 00:53:55.608
We can't involve ourselves.

837
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:27.348
He was a prince.

838
00:54:29.183 --> 00:54:32.603
He would have been a king
if the other bear hadn't defeated him.

839
00:54:32.687 --> 00:54:34.856
He lost everything.

840
00:54:34.939 --> 00:54:37.775
Oh, Pan, they've really hurt him.

841
00:54:41.112 --> 00:54:44.699
Lorek Byrnison? lorek Byrnison.

842
00:54:46.117 --> 00:54:49.162
- Be careful.
- I know where your arm our is.

843
00:54:51.706 --> 00:54:53.958
They tricked you out of it.

844
00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:55.960
They shouldn't have done that,
lorek Byrnison.

845
00:54:56.043 --> 00:54:59.338
It's in the district office
of the Magisterium.

846
00:55:00.465 --> 00:55:02.842
Right here in Trollesund.

847
00:55:02.925 --> 00:55:05.553
What is your name, child?

848
00:55:05.636 --> 00:55:07.346
Lyra Belacqua.

849
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:10.975
Then, Lyra Belacqua...

850
00:55:11.058 --> 00:55:13.478
I owe you a debt.

851
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:16.230
- I will serve you in your campaign...

852
00:55:16.314 --> 00:55:18.399
...until I am dead...

853
00:55:18.483 --> 00:55:21.694
or you have a victory.

854
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.834
Lorek!

855
00:56:19.919 --> 00:56:22.380
Lorek Byrnison!

856
00:56:22.463 --> 00:56:25.883
Lorek, listen.
Don't fight these men.

857
00:56:25.967 --> 00:56:28.052
What they done ain't right, I know.

858
00:56:28.135 --> 00:56:30.137
But if you fight, you'll kill them.

859
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:31.514
And there'll be more fighting...

860
00:56:31.597 --> 00:56:33.474
and we'll never get away
to rescue those kids.

861
00:56:39.313 --> 00:56:41.691
Let's not be too hasty.

862
00:56:41.774 --> 00:56:45.111
Way I see it,
there's no need for a dust-up.

863
00:56:46.779 --> 00:56:50.157
Howdy, lorek.
I was down South.

864
00:56:50.241 --> 00:56:53.077
Heard you ran into
a little local trouble.

865
00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.497
Didn't have the first notion
on how to spring ya.

866
00:56:56.581 --> 00:56:58.040
Fortunately, little girls...

867
00:56:58.124 --> 00:57:00.334
come in real resourceful
up in these parts.

868
00:57:03.629 --> 00:57:04.880
Well, looky here.

869
00:57:04.964 --> 00:57:06.882
- Reinforcements.

870
00:57:08.759 --> 00:57:11.971
What do you say you fellers
just call it a day?

871
00:57:16.058 --> 00:57:19.020
Just been hired on
by these gentlemen...

872
00:57:19.103 --> 00:57:22.023
of the Gyptian persuasion.

873
00:57:22.106 --> 00:57:24.525
You figurin' on joining
this turkey shoot?

874
00:57:24.609 --> 00:57:28.195
Yes. I have a contract
with the child.

875
00:57:30.948 --> 00:57:33.784
That's some pretty
fast work, Miss Lyra.

876
00:57:56.098 --> 00:57:58.100
My lord.

877
00:58:00.811 --> 00:58:03.898
Rise, Fra Pavel.

878
00:58:03.981 --> 00:58:05.733
I have received your news...

879
00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:10.154
about the Gyptian party
heading to the North.

880
00:58:10.237 --> 00:58:12.323
The matter is of
the first importance.

881
00:58:12.406 --> 00:58:15.785
They must be eliminated,
and Bolvangar protected.

882
00:58:17.203 --> 00:58:21.332
The intercision process is
more important than ever.

883
00:58:21.415 --> 00:58:24.210
Which is why it must be
taken out of the hands...

884
00:58:24.293 --> 00:58:26.545
of the Coulter woman.

885
00:58:26.629 --> 00:58:29.340
Oh?

886
00:58:30.424 --> 00:58:34.845
It was Mrs. Coulter
who took the Belacqua child...

887
00:58:34.929 --> 00:58:37.556
from Jordan College
and then let her slip away.

888
00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.643
Yes, that is
the most troubling of all.

889
00:58:41.852 --> 00:58:45.064
No matter.
One way or another...

890
00:58:45.147 --> 00:58:47.483
it's better that I've sent
Mrs. Coulter after the child.

891
00:58:47.566 --> 00:58:49.860
- You've sent her?
- Yes.

892
00:58:49.944 --> 00:58:52.279
She is to demonstrate
the improvements...

893
00:58:52.363 --> 00:58:56.200
to the intercision process
upon the Belacqua girl.

894
00:59:20.266 --> 00:59:23.018
- I'm sorry.

895
00:59:26.731 --> 00:59:28.733
Oh!

896
00:59:29.734 --> 00:59:32.236
I would never hurt you.

897
00:59:38.409 --> 00:59:40.411
Oh, Lyra.

898
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:45.166
I'll find you.

899
00:59:45.249 --> 00:59:48.043
I will find you.

900
01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:07.062
Careful now, boys.

901
01:00:07.146 --> 01:00:10.691
Airship machinery's kind of finicky.

902
01:00:10.775 --> 01:00:14.195
I want to die in a rocking chair,
not a hydrogen fire.

903
01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:16.697
And she was ever so clever,
Mrs. Coulter...

904
01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:18.699
but she was always
telling me what to do.

905
01:00:18.783 --> 01:00:20.785
I don't like people
telling me what to do.

906
01:00:20.868 --> 01:00:23.496
I bet you don't like it either.
I can tell.

907
01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:25.498
You're like my Uncle Asriel.

908
01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:28.626
He's a rough noble like you.
That's what I think.

909
01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:38.719
Samoyed lands.

910
01:00:38.803 --> 01:00:42.348
Samoyeds don't take
kindly to trespassers.

911
01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:45.518
LOREK BYRNISON:
It's the only way to reach Bolvangar.

912
01:00:47.603 --> 01:00:50.606
Stay close to me.

913
01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:53.734
- Come, child.
- It will be dark soon.

914
01:01:02.785 --> 01:01:05.204
How far do you reckon?

915
01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:07.915
Oh, I don't know
for sure, but a good few miles.

916
01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.709
We covered some ground.

917
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:36.068
What's wrong?
Wh... wh... what can you see?

918
01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.868
- Where are we going?
- Hush, Pan.

919
01:01:43.951 --> 01:01:45.786
They told us not to leave the tent.

920
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:47.192
- Is he coming, then?

921
01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:50.499
SECOND MAN:
Don't know. I'll have a look.

922
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:07.600
Lorek?

923
01:02:07.683 --> 01:02:10.060
What is it, child?

924
01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:13.814
The alethiometer keeps
telling me something.

925
01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:17.401
In the next valley,
there's a lake with a house by it...

926
01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:19.695
and it's troubled by a ghost.

927
01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:23.240
It's something to do
with the Gobblers and Roger.

928
01:02:23.324 --> 01:02:26.911
- You could take me there, couldn't you?

929
01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:28.829
You could carry me
there and back...

930
01:02:28.913 --> 01:02:30.748
before anyone knew,
couldn't you?

931
01:02:31.624 --> 01:02:35.085
You wish to ride me?

932
01:02:35.169 --> 01:02:37.046
Yeah.

933
01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:40.257
We will travel faster without arm our.

934
01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.252
Are those birds?

935
01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:19.004
Witches.

936
01:03:20.631 --> 01:03:22.716
More than I have ever seen.

937
01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.760
Where are they going?

938
01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:27.638
Flying to war.

939
01:03:28.931 --> 01:03:30.975
If they are flying
to the aid of your enemies...

940
01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:33.310
you should all be afraid.

941
01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:35.646
Are you afraid?

942
01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:37.481
No.

943
01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:41.235
When I am, I will master my fear.

944
01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:12.099
I will make sure the way is clear.

945
01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:14.852
No. Stay here.

946
01:04:36.707 --> 01:04:39.418
Lyra, no, please don't.

947
01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:41.420
Something's wrong.

948
01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:44.923
- Hush, Pan.
- Something terrible. I'm...

949
01:04:45.007 --> 01:04:47.384
I'm afraid.

950
01:04:47.468 --> 01:04:50.054
We've got to master our fear.

951
01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:13.994
Hello?

952
01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:16.080
Hello?

953
01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:42.648
Billy.

954
01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:45.025
Where's his daemon?

955
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:47.861
He doesn't have a daemon.

956
01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:49.738
That's...

957
01:05:49.822 --> 01:05:51.490
intercision.

958
01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:56.120
That's what
the Gobblers are doing...

959
01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:01.166
Cuttin' away kids' daemons.

960
01:06:02.543 --> 01:06:04.378
Where's my Ratter?

961
01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.463
Have you seen her?

962
01:06:06.547 --> 01:06:10.509
Billy, it's me, Lyra.

963
01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:13.512
Let me take you
back to your mum.

964
01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:15.597
I need Ratter.

965
01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:18.308
Billy, come on with me.

966
01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:20.477
We'll take you someplace safe.

967
01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:22.229
We'll find Ratter.

968
01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:41.373
Gracious god, what's this?

969
01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:47.296
Lyra, child,
what have you found?

970
01:06:47.379 --> 01:06:51.008
Billy. Billy Costa.

971
01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:53.468
MA COSTA:
Billy! Oh-oh-oh!

972
01:06:53.552 --> 01:06:55.679
Oh! Oh!

973
01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:57.890
Oh, Billy!
You're all right, Billy.

974
01:06:57.973 --> 01:07:00.142
You're safe now.

975
01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:02.269
Oh! We'll find your daemon.

976
01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:05.147
We'll bring 'er back.

977
01:07:21.163 --> 01:07:25.000
Here, take Lyra.
Gyptians, to arms!

978
01:07:34.635 --> 01:07:36.515
- Watch your backs!
- Protect the children!

979
01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:45.520
- Hyah!

980
01:07:49.233 --> 01:07:50.943
Look out, Lyra!

981
01:08:01.328 --> 01:08:02.996
Lorek!

982
01:08:03.372 --> 01:08:06.124
Lorek Byrnison, help me!

983
01:08:24.393 --> 01:08:26.979
Pan, where are they taking us?

984
01:08:27.062 --> 01:08:29.182
I don't know.
We've been going for hours.

985
01:08:42.619 --> 01:08:44.538
Ice bears, Pan.

986
01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.581
Ow.

987
01:08:46.665 --> 01:08:49.105
- I hope you're happy now.

988
01:09:03.307 --> 01:09:06.143
You're losing your touch, amigo.

989
01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:08.395
So am I.

990
01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:10.856
Don't worry.

991
01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:12.649
We'll get her back.

992
01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:17.237
The Samoyeds
won't lay a hand on her.

993
01:09:17.321 --> 01:09:19.781
She's worth more in one piece.

994
01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:25.412
I'll find her.

995
01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:28.999
I'll bring her back.
I can bargain with Ragnar.

996
01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:33.754
I'll drop you at the border,
pick you up on the way out.

997
01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:36.798
No. I will not leave her.

998
01:09:39.343 --> 01:09:41.386
You show up in Svalbard...

999
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:43.470
Ragnar and the rest of 'em
will tear you to pieces.

1000
01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.057
You know that.

1001
01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.100
I know I would feel ashamed...

1002
01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:49.811
to show less courage
than that child.

1003
01:09:49.895 --> 01:09:52.898
That kind of courage
could get you killed.

1004
01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:57.194
I will not live in shame
any longer, Scoresby.

1005
01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:00.364
No...

1006
01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:03.658
I reckon not.

1007
01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:07.746
I'm gonna take her down,
pick up the trail.

1008
01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:17.994
PANTALAIMON, WHISPERING:
Don't worry. lorek will come.

1009
01:10:18.006 --> 01:10:21.927
That's just it, Pan.
There's too many of them for him to fight.

1010
01:10:28.392 --> 01:10:30.435
We've got to do something.

1011
01:10:33.522 --> 01:10:38.652
Do you remember
what Mrs. Coulter said back at Jordan...

1012
01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:41.738
about the king of the bears
wanting a daemon?

1013
01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:47.077
Pan, I need you to hide.

1014
01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.414
- Don't let them see you.
- That's fine with me.

1015
01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:52.916
We can beat him, Pan.

1016
01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:08.014
What is this little thing?

1017
01:11:09.391 --> 01:11:12.477
Our greetings to you, great king.

1018
01:11:12.561 --> 01:11:16.481
Or rather, my greetings and not his.

1019
01:11:16.565 --> 01:11:18.692
Not whose?

1020
01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:21.611
Lorek Byrnison's, Your Majesty.

1021
01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:26.241
What have you to do
with lorek Byrnison?

1022
01:11:29.411 --> 01:11:31.705
I am lorek Byrnison's daemon.

1023
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:37.461
And how has the exile...

1024
01:11:37.544 --> 01:11:41.173
the unworthy lorek Byrnison,
obtained a daemon?

1025
01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:43.675
Lorek Byrnison was
the first bear to get a daemon...

1026
01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:46.052
- Hmm?
- ...but it should've been you.

1027
01:11:46.136 --> 01:11:49.890
They gave me to him at Bolvangar.
Mrs. Coulter did.

1028
01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:53.602
And how could you be
so far from him, hmm?

1029
01:11:53.685 --> 01:11:56.062
I'm like a witch's daemon, great king.

1030
01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:59.858
- I can go as far from him as I please.
- Mm. Well...

1031
01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:01.860
if you are his daemon...

1032
01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:05.822
then I will kill you right now
and be free of an enemy.

1033
01:12:05.906 --> 01:12:08.492
If you do that,
I can never be your daemon.

1034
01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:11.912
MY- - -dam0n'?

1035
01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:14.331
That's why I come here, see?

1036
01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:16.791
'Cause I want to be
your daemon, not his.

1037
01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:19.878
He's just an exile, nothing.

1038
01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:23.423
But you, you're powerful
and clever and rich...

1039
01:12:23.507 --> 01:12:26.635
and... and better in every way.

1040
01:12:26.718 --> 01:12:29.721
He's on his way here now,
to fight you.

1041
01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:32.599
What? He's mad.

1042
01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:35.101
- We shall destroy him!
- No.

1043
01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:37.354
- No.
- Hmm?

1044
01:12:37.437 --> 01:12:40.607
If you defeat him,
I will become your daemon.

1045
01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:43.401
But you must defeat him
in single combat.

1046
01:12:43.485 --> 01:12:47.364
Then all his strength
will flow into yours...

1047
01:12:47.447 --> 01:12:51.743
and my mind will flow
into your mind.

1048
01:12:51.826 --> 01:12:54.246
You and me, together.

1049
01:12:57.207 --> 01:13:00.502
Have him killed any other way,
and I'll just go out like a light...

1050
01:13:00.585 --> 01:13:01.878
and you'll never have a daemon.

1051
01:13:01.962 --> 01:13:04.214
Prove it.

1052
01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:07.509
Prove to me that you are a daemon.

1053
01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:10.095
Ask me something only you know.

1054
01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:13.139
Hmm.

1055
01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:15.767
How did I become king?

1056
01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:26.987
What is that, hm?

1057
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:29.364
- It's a daemon mirror, great king.
- Hmm?

1058
01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:33.243
We daemons use it to see
the truth in our own eyes.

1059
01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:58.602
Truly you are great
and powerful, Ragnar...

1060
01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:01.104
for you poisoned the old king...

1061
01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:04.733
then challenged the heir to the throne
and beat him in single combat.

1062
01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:09.487
Lorek Byrnison.

1063
01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:33.386
Oh, Pan, what have I done?

1064
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.513
Ragnar's too strong.

1065
01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:43.480
So here he is.

1066
01:14:43.563 --> 01:14:46.191
But what if the coward
dare not fight me?

1067
01:14:46.274 --> 01:14:49.152
Great king, let me speak to him.

1068
01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:51.863
- If I do, he will not suspect.
- Very well.

1069
01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:54.574
You go to him. Give him courage.

1070
01:14:54.658 --> 01:14:57.118
Bring him to his death.

1071
01:14:57.202 --> 01:15:00.163
Soon you'll be mine.

1072
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:14.302
Oh, lorek.

1073
01:15:14.386 --> 01:15:17.013
Lorek, dear,
I've done a terrible thing.

1074
01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:20.517
What terrible thing?

1075
01:15:22.686 --> 01:15:26.106
I told the king I was your daemon
and that he must fight you.

1076
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:28.108
If not, they would never let you fight.

1077
01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:30.235
They would burn you
before you even got up close.

1078
01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:32.987
But you've been fighting...

1079
01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:34.864
and running all this way.

1080
01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:38.785
Lyra. Lyra Belacqua.

1081
01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:43.123
No, I shall call you
Lyra Silver tongue.

1082
01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:46.835
To fight him is all I want.

1083
01:15:46.918 --> 01:15:49.921
Come, little daemon.

1084
01:15:58.138 --> 01:16:00.056
Fight well, lorek, my dear.

1085
01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:02.350
You're the real king,
and he ain't nothing.

1086
01:16:02.434 --> 01:16:05.603
Lyra, if I am killed...

1087
01:16:05.687 --> 01:16:07.731
Scoresby will find you.

1088
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.544
Is that all...

1089
01:17:52.627 --> 01:17:54.629
whimpering cub?

1090
01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:56.756
Is that all...

1091
01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.508
soon-to-die?

1092
01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:04.138
Is that all? Huh?

1093
01:18:13.982 --> 01:18:16.860
Is that all?

1094
01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:40.633
Yes, that is all.

1095
01:18:40.717 --> 01:18:43.803
That is all.

1096
01:18:43.887 --> 01:18:48.349
Bears, who is your king?

1097
01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:07.201
Lorek...

1098
01:19:07.285 --> 01:19:09.829
lorek, I thought I'd lost you.

1099
01:19:09.913 --> 01:19:11.414
Why?

1100
01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:14.167
You still own my contract.

1101
01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:20.173
And now I will take you to Bolvangar.

1102
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:26.346
We've got to stop them, lorek.

1103
01:19:26.429 --> 01:19:28.473
The alethiometer says
they'll hurt Roger.

1104
01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:53.790
There.

1105
01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:13.768
It may not hold us both.

1106
01:20:14.519 --> 01:20:17.230
You cross on your own.
I will follow.

1107
01:20:26.781 --> 01:20:29.409
I'm right here. Step quickly.

1108
01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:31.494
Don't look down.

1109
01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:49.178
- Don't look back!

1110
01:20:49.262 --> 01:20:51.347
You're almost there.

1111
01:21:07.447 --> 01:21:09.699
Run, Lyra!

1112
01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:12.076
Run! Run!

1113
01:21:20.043 --> 01:21:23.379
Lyra! I will get
Scoresby and the Gyptians.

1114
01:21:26.007 --> 01:21:29.010
- Wait for me there!

1115
01:21:29.093 --> 01:21:31.554
Lyra! Wait!

1116
01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:46.986
PANTALAIMON:
I don't like the look of this place.

1117
01:21:52.867 --> 01:21:54.869
Bolvangar.

1118
01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:57.121
Hello, there.

1119
01:21:57.205 --> 01:22:01.042
|... I got lost
in the snow. Where am I?

1120
01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:03.002
No need to worry, my child.

1121
01:22:03.086 --> 01:22:04.962
You're safe now.

1122
01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:14.722
Well, you'd better come inside.

1123
01:22:14.806 --> 01:22:16.682
It's warm and comfortable in here.

1124
01:22:16.766 --> 01:22:17.975
What's your name?

1125
01:22:18.059 --> 01:22:20.186
PANTALAIMON:
Don't tell him who we are.

1126
01:22:21.771 --> 01:22:24.607
Lizzie. Lizzie Brooks.

1127
01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:30.196
What were you doing
so far north, Lizzie?

1128
01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:32.406
That must be an interesting story.

1129
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:35.493
My dad and uncles,
they took me north.

1130
01:22:35.576 --> 01:22:37.495
They're traders.

1131
01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:41.249
Well, you're very lucky
to have found us when you got lost.

1132
01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:43.501
What is this place?

1133
01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:46.045
Oh, you'll like it.

1134
01:22:46.129 --> 01:22:48.589
It's called the Experimental Station.

1135
01:22:48.673 --> 01:22:50.508
What do you do here?

1136
01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:52.468
We help children grow up.

1137
01:22:52.552 --> 01:22:55.054
- Liar.
- You must be hungry, Lizzie.

1138
01:22:55.138 --> 01:22:58.099
Lucky you.
Just in time for dinner.

1139
01:23:14.157 --> 01:23:16.367
PANTALAIMON:
Can you see him? Is he here?

1140
01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.218
- Lyra, it's them!
- Pan! You found us!

1141
01:23:34.302 --> 01:23:36.470
- You're all right!
- You kept your promise!

1142
01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:50.568
I knew you'd come.

1143
01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:52.278
I promised, didn't I?

1144
01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:04.999
Roger, do you know
what they do to the kids here?

1145
01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:07.710
They say they're gonna give us
this operation, right?

1146
01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:09.462
Then they'll send us home...

1147
01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:11.297
and we won't have
to worry about Dust.

1148
01:24:12.256 --> 01:24:14.300
But once they call a kid in...

1149
01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:16.052
you'll never see them again.

1150
01:24:16.135 --> 01:24:18.763
They took Billy Costa
away last week...

1151
01:24:18.846 --> 01:24:20.306
and he's still gone.

1152
01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:23.559
Don't worry.
I've got a plan, all right'?

1153
01:24:25.603 --> 01:24:28.981
Tell the kids to have
their warm clothes ready.

1154
01:24:29.065 --> 01:24:31.150
I need to be alone someplace.

1155
01:24:32.235 --> 01:24:33.945
But not here.

1156
01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:40.409
They hardly ever use
this one, but be quick.

1157
01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:59.929
Ask it how
we're gonna get out of here.

1158
01:25:03.182 --> 01:25:05.101
But why would it...

1159
01:25:05.184 --> 01:25:06.852
Oh, no. It's them.

1160
01:25:06.936 --> 01:25:08.856
I think you'll be
pleased with our progress.

1161
01:25:08.896 --> 01:25:12.483
That may be so, but I am
very interested in discovering...

1162
01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:16.028
how several children managed
to wander free from the station.

1163
01:25:18.656 --> 01:25:20.241
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Coulter...

1164
01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:22.785
I-I hope you'll understand
th... that the question is moot.

1165
01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:25.538
Urn, any child who escapes
from the facility...

1166
01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.665
would not last
very long in the cold.

1167
01:25:27.748 --> 01:25:30.626
We have already recovered
two of the three missing children.

1168
01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:32.878
Were they alive?

1169
01:25:34.714 --> 01:25:36.465
Oh.

1170
01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:39.802
Well, that is unfortunate.

1171
01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:42.513
But enough of that for now.

1172
01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:44.765
I, at least, have some good news.

1173
01:25:47.018 --> 01:25:49.979
We needn't be concerned
with Lord Asriel any longer.

1174
01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:55.401
He has bribed his captors
and set up a secret laboratory...

1175
01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:57.820
in the furthest reaches
of the North.

1176
01:26:00.114 --> 01:26:03.242
The Magisterium soldiers
are on their way.

1177
01:26:03.326 --> 01:26:07.747
He will be arrested for heresy
and sentenced to death.

1178
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:09.749
- Put him to death? Dear me.

1179
01:26:12.752 --> 01:26:15.588
I think I will retire for the evening.

1180
01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:17.590
- Oh, well, yes, of course.

1181
01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:20.176
Uh, the orderlies will show you
to your chambers.

1182
01:26:24.722 --> 01:26:27.087
Wouldn't want to get
on the wrong side of her. I tell you that.

1183
01:26:27.099 --> 01:26:29.727
She's positively ghoulish.

1184
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:32.229
Do you remember
the first experiments...

1185
01:26:32.313 --> 01:26:34.440
when she was so keen
to see them pulled apart?

1186
01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:35.804
- Her and that mute of a daemon.
- Oh!

1187
01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:37.526
- What was that?

1188
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:38.970
Down there.
Under the table.

1189
01:26:38.986 --> 01:26:40.404
- Quick!
- Lyra!

1190
01:26:40.488 --> 01:26:42.808
- Grab her leg!
- Lyra, they've got me!

1191
01:26:42.823 --> 01:26:45.743
- Come here.

1192
01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:49.663
- Come on.
- Lyra! Oh! Aah!

1193
01:26:49.747 --> 01:26:52.666
- Let me go! Get off me! Oh!
- You can't! You're not allowed.

1194
01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:57.296
Lyra!

1195
01:27:03.094 --> 01:27:04.720
- Quickly now.

1196
01:27:04.804 --> 01:27:06.806
- Straight into the chamber.
- Let me go.

1197
01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:09.558
- Lorek Byrnison's gonna kill you.
- Aah!

1198
01:27:09.642 --> 01:27:11.727
- He'll rip your guts out!
- What a...

1199
01:27:11.811 --> 01:27:15.564
Don't fret, dear.
It's only a little cut.

1200
01:27:15.648 --> 01:27:17.233
You'll never keep us apart.

1201
01:27:17.316 --> 01:27:18.901
You want to grow up, don't you?

1202
01:27:18.984 --> 01:27:22.029
- Well, this is how you grow up.
- Stay away from me!

1203
01:27:22.113 --> 01:27:23.864
You'll never keep us apart!

1204
01:27:23.948 --> 01:27:26.409
- Set phase two.
- Never, never!

1205
01:27:32.415 --> 01:27:34.041
PANTALAIMON No, stop!

1206
01:27:34.125 --> 01:27:36.210
- Lyra!
- Pan!

1207
01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:38.629
- No!
- Never!

1208
01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:42.508
- You can't!

1209
01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:46.720
- Don't leave me, Pan.
- No! Stop!

1210
01:27:46.804 --> 01:27:49.098
- No! Help me.
- Lyra! !

1211
01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:57.148
Lyra!

1212
01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:28.846
Lyra. Darling.

1213
01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:30.961
- Don't. Don't you touch.
- No, no. No. No one will hurt you.

1214
01:28:30.973 --> 01:28:34.059
No one is going to hurt you.
No one is ever...

1215
01:28:34.143 --> 01:28:35.769
- ever going to hurt you.

1216
01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:39.607
They... they did it to Billy...

1217
01:28:39.690 --> 01:28:41.692
and those other kids.

1218
01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:44.403
They cut their daemons away.

1219
01:28:44.487 --> 01:28:47.531
Why? Why are they doing that?

1220
01:28:47.615 --> 01:28:51.494
I know it's difficult to understand,
but it's for their own good.

1221
01:28:51.577 --> 01:28:53.662
It's just a little cut.

1222
01:28:53.746 --> 01:28:57.625
You listen. Listen to me.

1223
01:28:57.708 --> 01:29:00.044
A long, long time ago...

1224
01:29:00.127 --> 01:29:02.588
some of our ancestors made...

1225
01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:04.965
Made a terrible mistake.

1226
01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:07.635
They disobeyed...

1227
01:29:07.718 --> 01:29:09.887
the Authority.

1228
01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:13.140
And that is what made Dust
come into the world.

1229
01:29:13.224 --> 01:29:16.936
And ever since then, we have been sick
with it, we've been sick with Dust.

1230
01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:19.271
But there is a way out.

1231
01:29:19.355 --> 01:29:21.941
You see, Dust doesn't settle
on innocent children.

1232
01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:26.946
It's later, when your daemon
begins to settle...

1233
01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:30.407
that Dust begins
to swarm all around us...

1234
01:29:30.491 --> 01:29:33.994
trying to work its mischief.

1235
01:29:34.078 --> 01:29:37.414
And that is how children begin to have
all sorts of nasty thoughts...

1236
01:29:37.498 --> 01:29:40.042
and unhappy feelings and...

1237
01:29:41.627 --> 01:29:44.046
But there is a way to stop it.

1238
01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:48.968
A little cut, and gone forever.

1239
01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:52.346
Well, if it's so good,
then why don't you do it yourself?

1240
01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:54.265
Why didn't you let them do it to me?

1241
01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:59.812
I'm going to tell you something.

1242
01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:03.148
Something very important,
something you don't know.

1243
01:30:03.232 --> 01:30:05.401
Intercision isn't perfect yet...

1244
01:30:05.484 --> 01:30:08.153
and you're not just anyone, Lyra.

1245
01:30:08.237 --> 01:30:12.491
Your mother didn't die
in an airship accident as you were told.

1246
01:30:12.575 --> 01:30:16.412
She wasn't married to your father,
and even though...

1247
01:30:16.495 --> 01:30:20.040
Even though she loved you
very much and...

1248
01:30:20.124 --> 01:30:22.167
and she wanted to keep you...

1249
01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:25.921
it wasn't allowed.

1250
01:30:27.881 --> 01:30:30.384
And so you were taken from her.

1251
01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:34.555
And it wasn't until things changed...

1252
01:30:34.638 --> 01:30:37.391
and she was free to do
as she wanted, that...

1253
01:30:40.185 --> 01:30:43.188
that she went to Jordan College
and she spoke to the Master.

1254
01:30:43.272 --> 01:30:45.733
No! You can't be!

1255
01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:56.368
Yes, Lyra, you're mine.

1256
01:30:56.452 --> 01:30:58.621
And you're safe with me.

1257
01:30:59.872 --> 01:31:02.333
You'll always be safe with me.

1258
01:31:05.711 --> 01:31:07.212
Who's my father?

1259
01:31:14.345 --> 01:31:17.848
Lord Asriel.
He's my father, isn't he?

1260
01:31:20.392 --> 01:31:23.687
Yes. Yes.

1261
01:31:26.815 --> 01:31:28.901
Mm.

1262
01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:35.574
Now, I almost forgot.

1263
01:31:35.658 --> 01:31:39.912
The Master of Jordan
gave you something, didn't he?

1264
01:31:39.995 --> 01:31:43.040
He gave you an alethiometer,
didn't he?

1265
01:31:44.625 --> 01:31:46.460
But you see...

1266
01:31:47.795 --> 01:31:50.506
it wasn't really his to give.

1267
01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:54.593
Ah, he did. Oh.

1268
01:31:54.677 --> 01:31:56.428
Must've seemed such a puzzle...

1269
01:31:56.512 --> 01:31:58.764
what a silly old thing
like that was any good for.

1270
01:31:59.807 --> 01:32:01.850
All right.

1271
01:32:04.645 --> 01:32:06.730
Here it is.

1272
01:32:07.272 --> 01:32:08.440
Thank you.

1273
01:32:09.817 --> 01:32:10.817
Oh!

1274
01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:13.612
What a funny old tin.
Did you...

1275
01:32:13.696 --> 01:32:16.657
Did you put it in here
to keep it safe?

1276
01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.742
Hmm? Ah!

1277
01:32:40.222 --> 01:32:42.099
PANTALAIMON:
Run! Lyra, let's go! Go!

1278
01:32:43.225 --> 01:32:45.769
We're just not used
to that reaction.

1279
01:32:45.853 --> 01:32:48.564
Understand this, Sister Clara,
they're not registered...

1280
01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:58.592
[Children gasping,
daemons whimpering]

1281
01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:10.687
Go on, then. Go on.

1282
01:34:36.755 --> 01:34:38.924
Lorek! lorek!

1283
01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:41.760
- Run, child!

1284
01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:49.059
- Let's go! Come on!

1285
01:35:15.168 --> 01:35:18.255
You'd better not touch me.
I'm warning you.

1286
01:35:19.298 --> 01:35:20.632
Hah!

1287
01:35:26.763 --> 01:35:28.891
Serafina Pekkala?

1288
01:35:49.202 --> 01:35:50.996
Aah!

1289
01:36:00.422 --> 01:36:01.840
Aaah!

1290
01:36:07.012 --> 01:36:09.848
- This way.
- Get out! Get out!

1291
01:36:09.932 --> 01:36:11.732
- Mrs. Coulter!
- Get her up.

1292
01:36:11.808 --> 01:36:13.936
Come!

1293
01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.565
Come on, come on!
Hurry!

1294
01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:25.906
Aah! Help me!

1295
01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:39.211
Charge!

1296
01:36:40.337 --> 01:36:42.089
Come on! Run!

1297
01:36:58.355 --> 01:36:59.731
Aah!

1298
01:36:59.815 --> 01:37:02.067
Come on! Get down, men!

1299
01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:04.945
Mr. Scoresby, help lorek!

1300
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:36.893
Come on!

1301
01:37:41.356 --> 01:37:43.233
Urgh!

1302
01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:47.988
Argh!

1303
01:38:23.356 --> 01:38:26.651
Joe! Oh, my precious!

1304
01:38:26.735 --> 01:38:29.488
- Dad!
- Oh, my goodness, boy!

1305
01:38:31.239 --> 01:38:32.657
- Darling!
- Mum!

1306
01:38:32.741 --> 01:38:34.493
Here's my daughter! Come here!

1307
01:38:40.749 --> 01:38:43.835
Gyptians! To me!

1308
01:38:43.919 --> 01:38:46.004
We're going home!

1309
01:38:49.007 --> 01:38:51.885
Lyra, we've got to go.

1310
01:38:51.968 --> 01:38:53.887
It's time to go home.

1311
01:38:54.429 --> 01:38:56.556
I can't, Roger.

1312
01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.476
I've got to go to my father
and bring him the alethiometer.

1313
01:38:59.559 --> 01:39:00.559
Your father?

1314
01:39:00.602 --> 01:39:03.021
Lord Asriel.
Mrs. Coulter and them...

1315
01:39:03.105 --> 01:39:06.316
- They're gonna kill him.
- Then I'm going too.

1316
01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:10.362
You said you was gonna
come and get me. You got me.

1317
01:39:16.952 --> 01:39:20.705
Miss Lyra, are you ready to fly?

1318
01:39:23.375 --> 01:39:26.128
I know where she's going.

1319
01:39:39.850 --> 01:39:43.436
Well, they're all tucked in
back there.

1320
01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:46.064
That little girl's somethin', huh?

1321
01:39:50.777 --> 01:39:53.655
There's a prophesy
about that child, Mr. Scoresby.

1322
01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:58.201
She will decide the war
which is to come.

1323
01:39:58.285 --> 01:39:59.911
War?

1324
01:40:01.705 --> 01:40:03.874
I ain't heard rumor of any war.

1325
01:40:03.957 --> 01:40:06.168
You Will.

1326
01:40:06.251 --> 01:40:09.880
It is your war too,
whether you know it or not.

1327
01:40:09.963 --> 01:40:14.092
- What would the quarrel be about?
- Nothing less than free will.

1328
01:40:15.177 --> 01:40:19.723
The Magisterium not only seeks to
control everyone in this world...

1329
01:40:19.806 --> 01:40:22.267
but every world in every universe.

1330
01:40:25.103 --> 01:40:28.023
They've been unable
to extend their power until now.

1331
01:40:28.106 --> 01:40:32.277
But if Asriel finds
a way to travel between worlds...

1332
01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.072
nothing will stop them
from trying to take over.

1333
01:40:36.156 --> 01:40:38.074
Nothing but us...

1334
01:40:38.158 --> 01:40:40.202
and that child.

1335
01:40:50.212 --> 01:40:52.255
What's it telling you?

1336
01:41:06.394 --> 01:41:09.439
It's telling me about my father.

1337
01:41:09.522 --> 01:41:12.484
It says I'm bringing him
what he needs.

1338
01:41:12.567 --> 01:41:14.986
We're going home, aren't we, Lyra?

1339
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:18.657
After we save your father.

1340
01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:20.242
Course.

1341
01:41:20.325 --> 01:41:23.578
'Cept, first we gotta sort out
some things that need sorting.

1342
01:41:23.662 --> 01:41:28.833
Like Billy and them other kids that lost
their daemons. We've got to help them.

1343
01:41:28.917 --> 01:41:30.323
And it isn't like the Magisterium's...

1344
01:41:30.335 --> 01:41:33.046
just gonna let us go home to Jordan
just like that...

1345
01:41:33.129 --> 01:41:35.131
or leave off ordering people about.

1346
01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:38.260
And Dust...

1347
01:41:38.343 --> 01:41:40.178
I want to know what Dust is.

1348
01:41:41.554 --> 01:41:44.724
Maybe we're supposed to go to that other
world with my father and find out.

1349
01:41:44.808 --> 01:41:47.185
That's an awful lot to sort out.

1350
01:41:47.269 --> 01:41:48.812
Well, who else is gonna do it?

1351
01:41:48.895 --> 01:41:51.439
'Sides, we're in this together now.

1352
01:41:51.523 --> 01:41:53.733
Yeah, suppose we are.

1353
01:41:55.485 --> 01:41:59.114
You reckon it would do any harm
to get some sleep now?

1354
01:41:59.197 --> 01:42:00.282
Go on, then.

1355
01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:12.210
We'll set things right.

1356
01:42:12.294 --> 01:42:14.546
We Will.

1357
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:17.257
You and me...

1358
01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.259
And lorek.

1359
01:42:19.342 --> 01:42:22.595
And Serafina Pekkala
and Mr. Scoresby.

1360
01:42:23.638 --> 01:42:24.723
And my father.

1361
01:42:26.099 --> 01:42:28.518
- We'll set it right, Pan.

1362
01:42:30.353 --> 01:42:32.731
Just let them try to stop us.
