00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
24.000 English

2
00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:47.585
The Transporter (2002)

3
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.628
Go, go, go, go!
Move it, move it!

4
00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.770
Move it! Let's go!

5
00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.538
Move, move! In the car!
Let's go.

6
00:03:46.281 --> 00:03:47.373
Let's go!

7
00:03:47.482 --> 00:03:49.177
There's 4 of you.

8
00:03:49.284 --> 00:03:51.081
You can count.
I'm impressed. Now drive.

9
00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:53.051
Rule one...
Never change the deal.

10
00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:54.382
The deal was
transportation...

11
00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.717
for 3 men
with a combined weight...

12
00:03:55.824 --> 00:03:57.314
of 254 kilos.

13
00:03:57.425 --> 00:03:59.825
Yeah? Well,
this is a new deal.

14
00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:02.055
An extra 80 kilos
means we'll not make...

15
00:04:02.163 --> 00:04:03.994
your destination on
the gas I have allotted.

16
00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.566
So we'll stop
and get more gas!

17
00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:06.861
Every stop we make
exposes us.

18
00:04:06.968 --> 00:04:07.900
Every exposure...

19
00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:09.731
increases the risk
of getting caught.

20
00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:12.432
An extra 80 kilos means
the Koni shock absorbers...

21
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.201
I installed for this job
will not give us...

22
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:15.276
the ability
to outmaneuver...

23
00:04:15.376 --> 00:04:17.367
any police that might
be chasing us.

24
00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.004
Which means,
if there is a chase...

25
00:04:20.115 --> 00:04:22.447
we lose our advantage,
which also increases...

26
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.915
the possibility
of getting caught.

27
00:04:24.018 --> 00:04:26.077
I don't want
to get caught.

28
00:04:26.187 --> 00:04:27.552
You don't want
to get caught.

29
00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:29.020
Just drive the car, man...

30
00:04:29.124 --> 00:04:30.421
or you're gonna catch
a bullet through the brains!

31
00:04:30.525 --> 00:04:31.685
And who's going
to drive?

32
00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:33.192
Shoot this asshole!
I'll drive.

33
00:04:33.294 --> 00:04:35.319
Not without the ignition
code you won't.

34
00:04:40.401 --> 00:04:44.633
3 men. 254 kilos.

35
00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:46.673
That was the deal.

36
00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:50.336
Argh!

37
00:04:53.047 --> 00:04:56.915
3 men, 254 kilos.

38
00:04:57.018 --> 00:04:58.952
Seat belts.

39
00:04:59.053 --> 00:05:00.213
Argh!

40
00:05:04.926 --> 00:05:07.393
Shit!

41
00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:43.954
See what I mean
about the shocks?

42
00:05:49.604 --> 00:05:51.071
Now it's time.

43
00:05:57.612 --> 00:05:59.603
Move it, Marcel, move it!

44
00:06:00.748 --> 00:06:02.841
Look out!
Get out of the road!

45
00:06:06.821 --> 00:06:08.379
One way, one way!

46
00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:10.320
We're going
the wrong way!

47
00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:11.915
Stop it,
Marcel, stop!

48
00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:15.421
Move away!

49
00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:20.025
Look out, look out!

50
00:06:20.134 --> 00:06:21.624
Whoa!

51
00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:23.533
Whoo-hoo!

52
00:06:35.817 --> 00:06:40.151
Yes!

53
00:06:40.255 --> 00:06:42.519
Go, go, go!

54
00:06:42.624 --> 00:06:43.556
Merde.!

55
00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:58.030
Oh... shit!

56
00:07:29.137 --> 00:07:30.604
If you don't mind...

57
00:07:30.705 --> 00:07:31.933
I just conditioned
the leather back there.

58
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:36.536
Take us to the drop point!

59
00:07:36.644 --> 00:07:37.770
Not yet.

60
00:07:50.158 --> 00:07:52.251
Aah!

61
00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:55.988
Hello.

62
00:07:56.097 --> 00:07:58.088
The cops, the cops!

63
00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:59.598
What are you doing?
Don't stop now!

64
00:07:59.701 --> 00:08:01.168
Do something!
Come on, do something!

65
00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:03.237
What are you thinking?

66
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.201
Your gun, please.

67
00:09:29.657 --> 00:09:31.318
Police! Stop!

68
00:09:31.426 --> 00:09:33.121
Stop! Police!

69
00:09:37.965 --> 00:09:40.490
I'm fed up with this car chase!

70
00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:06.751
You gave me too much.

71
00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:09.853
We need you to take us to Avignon.

72
00:10:09.964 --> 00:10:13.627
The deal was this far
and no further.

73
00:10:13.734 --> 00:10:16.225
The deal is the deal.
Rule number one.

74
00:10:16.337 --> 00:10:17.304
Rules are meant to be broken.

75
00:10:17.405 --> 00:10:18.736
Not mine.

76
00:10:21.609 --> 00:10:25.443
Let's go. Get in the car.

77
00:10:25.546 --> 00:10:27.377
Come on! Quick!

78
00:10:28.749 --> 00:10:30.273
Move it!

79
00:11:13.728 --> 00:11:14.820
Really I did.

80
00:11:14.929 --> 00:11:16.362
Oh, yeah, well, how come...

81
00:11:16.464 --> 00:11:17.692
you don't have your
yellow card with you?

82
00:11:17.798 --> 00:11:19.288
Well, I... I...

83
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.027
must've left it
back in Nam on the base.

84
00:11:21.135 --> 00:11:22.534
Yeah, they all say that.

85
00:11:22.637 --> 00:11:23.968
"Left it back in Nam
on the base." Uh-huh.

86
00:11:24.071 --> 00:11:25.663
Let me show you
what we do to people...

87
00:11:25.773 --> 00:11:27.104
who left it back in Nam
on the base.

88
00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:28.505
Oh, no!
Please let go of me!

89
00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:29.769
Where are you taking me?

90
00:11:29.877 --> 00:11:31.640
You gotta be punished
for not carrying...

91
00:11:31.746 --> 00:11:33.771
your shot record on you.
It's a fate far worse than death.

92
00:11:40.087 --> 00:11:42.453
The Argentinian
government reaffirmed...

93
00:11:42.557 --> 00:11:43.524
its commitment to meeting...

94
00:11:43.624 --> 00:11:46.252
the I.M. F's target
this year.

95
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.328
And yesterday, in Nice...

96
00:11:48.429 --> 00:11:50.863
4 men robbed the Alliance
Investment Corporation.

97
00:11:50.965 --> 00:11:53.331
One man died
on the sidewalk.

98
00:11:53.434 --> 00:11:56.198
The others were apprehended
early this morning...

99
00:11:56.304 --> 00:11:59.239
when they took a wrong turn
on a one-way street...

100
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.672
in Avignon and ran into
a taxi cab.

101
00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:02.743
The police said...

102
00:12:02.843 --> 00:12:04.310
were it not for their
poor driving habits...

103
00:12:04.412 --> 00:12:06.471
the 20 million euros
in bearer bonds...

104
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:09.641
would have been cashed
and gone by this afternoon.

105
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.615
And in other news...

106
00:12:15.156 --> 00:12:17.624
I always say the way
a man treats his car...

107
00:12:17.725 --> 00:12:20.694
is how he treats himself.

108
00:12:20.795 --> 00:12:22.422
I'd say that's probably true,
Inspector.

109
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.226
Heh heh heh!
You have a good sense of humor...

110
00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:27.028
for a foreigner,
Monsieur Frank.

111
00:12:27.134 --> 00:12:29.500
Like the French.
Sly wit.

112
00:12:29.604 --> 00:12:31.902
Just the right amount
of flavor.

113
00:12:32.006 --> 00:12:33.234
Been out driving?

114
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:35.502
Until they pass a law
that says I can't.

115
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.168
You want to come in
for a coffee?

116
00:12:37.278 --> 00:12:38.711
Uh, thank you...

117
00:12:38.813 --> 00:12:40.804
but I have a lot
of stops to make.

118
00:12:40.915 --> 00:12:42.405
88 to be exact.

119
00:12:42.516 --> 00:12:44.848
That's a lot of stops.

120
00:12:44.952 --> 00:12:49.286
A lot of 1999
black BMW 765s...

121
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.882
with 06 in the license
plates to check out.

122
00:12:52.994 --> 00:12:54.655
Oh, it's a very
popular car...

123
00:12:54.762 --> 00:12:56.627
with a certain type
down here.

124
00:12:56.731 --> 00:12:58.130
You've seen them.

125
00:12:58.232 --> 00:12:59.529
They come over from Italy...

126
00:12:59.634 --> 00:13:01.397
in those very expensive suits...

127
00:13:01.502 --> 00:13:02.594
and the young pretty girls...

128
00:13:02.703 --> 00:13:05.399
with the big jewelry
and too much make-up.

129
00:13:05.506 --> 00:13:08.475
Very... Mafia.

130
00:13:08.576 --> 00:13:10.305
There was a robbery.

131
00:13:10.411 --> 00:13:11.537
A getaway.

132
00:13:11.646 --> 00:13:15.309
Some very fancy driving.

133
00:13:15.416 --> 00:13:19.750
By someone in a 1999
black BMW 735?

134
00:13:19.854 --> 00:13:21.845
With 06 on the plate.

135
00:13:23.357 --> 00:13:25.552
You have been
in the city lately?

136
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.252
Not for a while.

137
00:13:27.361 --> 00:13:30.194
I love Nice.
The food...

138
00:13:30.297 --> 00:13:31.662
the way they grill fish.

139
00:13:31.766 --> 00:13:33.825
No place else in France does it...

140
00:13:33.934 --> 00:13:35.026
the way they do in Nice.

141
00:13:35.136 --> 00:13:36.933
And the women...

142
00:13:37.038 --> 00:13:39.905
I prefer the women there.

143
00:13:40.007 --> 00:13:43.670
They are more...
complicated...

144
00:13:43.778 --> 00:13:46.042
than the local variety.

145
00:13:46.147 --> 00:13:49.116
Don't you think?

146
00:13:49.216 --> 00:13:51.582
I don't particularly
like complicated.

147
00:13:51.686 --> 00:13:53.244
You like to keep it simple.

148
00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:54.787
Why are you so interested?

149
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:56.789
Oh, you know, uh...

150
00:13:56.891 --> 00:13:58.381
ever since
I'm a little boy...

151
00:13:58.492 --> 00:14:00.687
military people
have always intrigued me.

152
00:14:00.795 --> 00:14:02.626
I'm ex-military.

153
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.563
I'm an ex-little boy.

154
00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:13.532
Sure you don't have time
for a coffee?

155
00:14:13.641 --> 00:14:15.905
Everything is always...

156
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.308
so neat with you,
Monsieur Frank.

157
00:14:20.181 --> 00:14:22.615
Nothing ever out of place.

158
00:14:22.717 --> 00:14:24.207
I'll take that as a compliment...

159
00:14:24.318 --> 00:14:27.754
coming from a man who pays
attention to every detail.

160
00:14:29.724 --> 00:14:32.158
Maybe I'll come back
later for that coffee.

161
00:14:34.195 --> 00:14:35.822
Door's always open to you.

162
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.625
Hmph.

163
00:14:40.134 --> 00:14:42.432
Unh. Ahh.

164
00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:50.242
Lupo gave me your number.

165
00:14:50.344 --> 00:14:51.333
Be brief.

166
00:14:51.445 --> 00:14:52.571
I'm looking for a transporter.

167
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.874
I'm listening.

168
00:14:53.981 --> 00:14:57.144
¶ Are you ready?

169
00:14:57.251 --> 00:14:58.479
¶ Are you ready...

170
00:15:00.554 --> 00:15:01.541
One bag, that's it.

171
00:15:01.653 --> 00:15:02.811
Dimensions.

172
00:15:04.485 --> 00:15:06.143
Be specific.

173
00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.180
One meter fifty
by half meter.

174
00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.178
Weight?

175
00:15:09.281 --> 00:15:11.336
50 kilos, not more.

176
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:16.036
Destination?

177
00:15:16.143 --> 00:15:17.199
24 Rue de Luxembourg.

178
00:15:17.309 --> 00:15:19.001
You're delivering to Mister...

179
00:15:19.108 --> 00:15:21.095
Rule 2... No names.

180
00:15:23.472 --> 00:15:25.198
Time of pickup?

181
00:15:25.304 --> 00:15:28.859
7:00 in the morning
at the front door.

182
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.157
A package,
one meter fifty by fifty...

183
00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.456
50 kilos,
250 kilometers...

184
00:15:35.564 --> 00:15:36.586
travelling within
the speed limit...

185
00:15:36.696 --> 00:15:37.990
one stop for refreshments...

186
00:15:38.095 --> 00:15:39.888
40,000.

187
00:15:39.993 --> 00:15:41.514
Half now, half on delivery.

188
00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:43.351
Delivery will be at noon.

189
00:15:43.458 --> 00:15:45.786
If no one's there,
it is not my responsibility.

190
00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:47.615
I'll leave the package.
Once we make a deal...

191
00:15:47.722 --> 00:15:49.152
the terms of that deal
cannot be changed...

192
00:15:49.254 --> 00:15:50.344
or renegotiated.

193
00:15:50.454 --> 00:15:51.441
Another rule?

194
00:15:51.553 --> 00:15:53.948
It's rule number one.

195
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:55.276
Do we have a deal?

196
00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.137
You're very precise.

197
00:16:03.244 --> 00:16:05.833
Transportation is
a precise business.

198
00:17:07.868 --> 00:17:09.423
Flat.

199
00:19:29.771 --> 00:19:31.860
Hi.

200
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.491
Now, don't move.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

201
00:19:38.598 --> 00:19:40.119
I'm just gonna
make a little hole...

202
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:41.627
so you can drink.
That's all I'm gonna do.

203
00:19:41.729 --> 00:19:42.954
Please... please!
Please, come on.

204
00:19:57.585 --> 00:20:00.105
Come on, drink.

205
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:04.513
Slowly.

206
00:20:14.541 --> 00:20:16.130
OK, OK, that's enough.

207
00:20:17.905 --> 00:20:18.835
Good girl.

208
00:21:00.309 --> 00:21:01.467
I'm going to take
the tape off.

209
00:21:01.575 --> 00:21:03.005
If you scream,
I'll have to kill you.

210
00:21:03.107 --> 00:21:05.935
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:21:06.038 --> 00:21:08.093
Aah! I have to pee!

212
00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:11.565
You want me to do it
in your car?

213
00:21:14.067 --> 00:21:15.395
OK.

214
00:21:15.499 --> 00:21:17.520
Mmph!

215
00:21:25.825 --> 00:21:26.847
I'm gonna take my knife out...

216
00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:29.854
so don't scream, OK?
It's to cut you free.

217
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.609
You don't need
your mouth to pee.

218
00:21:42.814 --> 00:21:44.641
You have one minute.

219
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.835
55... 54...

220
00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:54.666
53... 52...

221
00:22:00.135 --> 00:22:02.724
You're breaking
the rules, Frank.

222
00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:04.661
Not good to break the rules.

223
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.051
15...

224
00:22:18.323 --> 00:22:20.219
7...

225
00:22:22.986 --> 00:22:24.950
2...

226
00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:26.948
Time's up.

227
00:22:29.482 --> 00:22:31.378
Don't make me drag you out.

228
00:22:44.172 --> 00:22:45.727
Shit!

229
00:23:11.487 --> 00:23:12.951
Aah!

230
00:23:28.242 --> 00:23:30.637
Aah!

231
00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.601
No, please! Nnn!

232
00:23:34.405 --> 00:23:36.369
Rule 3...
Never look in the package.

233
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.457
Hope you enjoyed your pee...

234
00:23:38.568 --> 00:23:40.623
because it's your
last on this trip.

235
00:23:57.156 --> 00:23:59.676
Aah!

236
00:24:10.513 --> 00:24:13.772
See what comes
of breaking the rules?

237
00:24:20.507 --> 00:24:22.733
¶ Yeah, yeah

238
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:29.122
¶ My music, my life,
¶ my heart, my soul...

239
00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:30.994
Jerk!

240
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.586
¶ My wife, my daughter,
¶ my love, my dream

241
00:24:33.697 --> 00:24:36.286
¶ My mother, my father,
¶ my brother, my team

242
00:24:36.396 --> 00:24:39.155
¶ My camp, my squad,
¶ my house, my car

243
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.985
¶ My boat, my shoes,
¶ my pants, my shirt

244
00:24:42.092 --> 00:24:44.783
¶ My coke, my sugar,
¶ my cream, my butter

245
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.854
¶ My toast, my all
¶ my queen, my folks

246
00:24:47.954 --> 00:24:50.918
¶ My baby
¶ walk like 6 strings tall

247
00:24:51.019 --> 00:24:55.573
¶ Talk like she's my everything

248
00:24:55.683 --> 00:24:56.670
You're late.

249
00:24:56.782 --> 00:24:59.302
Ran into a little problem.

250
00:24:59.413 --> 00:25:01.707
Nothing serious?

251
00:25:05.543 --> 00:25:06.973
Nothing serious.

252
00:25:20.333 --> 00:25:21.797
You open the package?

253
00:25:21.899 --> 00:25:24.953
Rule 3...
Never open the package.

254
00:25:25.064 --> 00:25:27.290
Ha! I like that.

255
00:25:27.395 --> 00:25:29.484
Rules.

256
00:25:29.593 --> 00:25:33.023
You can't get anything done
in the world without rules.

257
00:25:33.124 --> 00:25:34.951
You're a foreigner, right?

258
00:25:35.057 --> 00:25:36.044
This is a nice little thing...

259
00:25:36.156 --> 00:25:37.643
you've got going
for yourself here.

260
00:25:37.754 --> 00:25:42.012
High class,
good reputation.

261
00:25:42.118 --> 00:25:43.242
I didn't get your name.

262
00:25:43.351 --> 00:25:45.940
Rule 2... No names.

263
00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:47.946
Of course.

264
00:25:59.907 --> 00:26:02.496
You don't count it?

265
00:26:02.605 --> 00:26:05.364
Why? Should I?

266
00:26:05.469 --> 00:26:06.865
No, no.

267
00:26:06.969 --> 00:26:08.661
That concludes the deal.

268
00:26:13.498 --> 00:26:17.427
You know,
I was wondering...

269
00:26:17.528 --> 00:26:18.890
if you wouldn't mind...

270
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:21.254
transporting something for me.

271
00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:23.323
That's what you do, right?

272
00:26:23.424 --> 00:26:25.910
You deliver,
no questions asked.

273
00:26:29.553 --> 00:26:30.745
Why not?

274
00:26:30.853 --> 00:26:32.408
Mmm!

275
00:26:35.117 --> 00:26:37.308
Weight?

276
00:26:37.415 --> 00:26:41.004
Oh, maybe a kilo.

277
00:26:41.113 --> 00:26:42.441
Destination?

278
00:26:42.545 --> 00:26:45.599
Grenoble, 306 Rue du Lac...

279
00:26:45.709 --> 00:26:47.196
a Mister...

280
00:26:47.309 --> 00:26:50.239
Oh, right. I forgot.

281
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.464
Rule 2.

282
00:27:09.327 --> 00:27:11.382
Heh heh heh!

283
00:27:11.492 --> 00:27:13.184
I like him.

284
00:28:47.628 --> 00:28:49.558
What the fuck?!

285
00:29:01.053 --> 00:29:02.278
Come on!

286
00:29:10.914 --> 00:29:12.401
Oh!

287
00:29:12.512 --> 00:29:13.636
Aah!

288
00:29:20.507 --> 00:29:22.199
Where is he?

289
00:29:25.337 --> 00:29:26.699
Aah!

290
00:30:02.745 --> 00:30:03.732
Uhh!

291
00:30:21.033 --> 00:30:22.089
Uhh!

292
00:31:46.143 --> 00:31:47.368
Mm!

293
00:31:48.942 --> 00:31:51.304
You're like dog shit!
You're everywhere.

294
00:31:51.407 --> 00:31:53.065
Yeah.

295
00:31:53.173 --> 00:31:54.297
I know, you wanna pee.

296
00:31:54.405 --> 00:31:56.266
All you wanna do is pee.

297
00:32:04.998 --> 00:32:06.690
Shit.

298
00:32:15.724 --> 00:32:16.689
¶ I got love

299
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.777
¶ I got love for

300
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:20.785
¶ My homies
¶ who be rollin' wit me

301
00:32:20.887 --> 00:32:22.215
¶ Play no game

302
00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:23.783
¶ Play no games

303
00:32:23.885 --> 00:32:26.145
Frank, you stupid shit.

304
00:32:26.251 --> 00:32:27.545
¶ I got love

305
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:29.113
¶ I got love

306
00:32:29.215 --> 00:32:31.577
¶ For my niggaz
¶ on my family tree

307
00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:32.837
¶ I got love

308
00:32:32.945 --> 00:32:35.034
¶ Love for the ghetto,
¶ down for whatever

309
00:32:35.145 --> 00:32:36.370
¶ If you was down before

310
00:32:36.476 --> 00:32:39.201
¶You gon' still
¶ gon' be down wit me

311
00:32:39.308 --> 00:32:42.430
¶ I got game 'cause
¶ the game was given to me

312
00:33:53.492 --> 00:33:56.217
I ask the questions.
You answer the questions.

313
00:33:56.324 --> 00:33:58.311
No long speeches.
Just keep it simple.

314
00:33:58.422 --> 00:33:59.546
Got it?

315
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.547
Who are you?

316
00:34:04.652 --> 00:34:06.639
My name is Lai.
I come from Chi...

317
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.214
Uhh!

318
00:34:08.316 --> 00:34:11.280
I ask the questions.
You answer the questions.

319
00:34:11.381 --> 00:34:12.970
Nothing more.
Nothing less.

320
00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.408
You want to try again?

321
00:34:19.542 --> 00:34:20.870
What kind of shit am I in?

322
00:34:20.975 --> 00:34:23.303
Deep shit.
Very deep shit.

323
00:34:23.406 --> 00:34:25.370
Those guys...
Sorry! Sorry!

324
00:34:25.471 --> 00:34:26.696
I won't say any...
Mm!

325
00:34:56.451 --> 00:34:58.942
Bon appétit.

326
00:34:59.054 --> 00:35:00.578
Where are you going?

327
00:35:00.689 --> 00:35:03.021
To bed.

328
00:35:03.124 --> 00:35:04.182
I can't think straight
when I'm tired.

329
00:35:04.292 --> 00:35:05.384
After a good night's sleep...

330
00:35:05.493 --> 00:35:06.858
I always see things better.

331
00:35:06.962 --> 00:35:08.020
Can I leave?

332
00:35:08.129 --> 00:35:09.494
Be my guest.

333
00:35:39.561 --> 00:35:40.459
Aah!

334
00:37:04.546 --> 00:37:07.014
Hey...

335
00:37:07.115 --> 00:37:09.709
are you comfortable?

336
00:37:09.818 --> 00:37:11.410
- Boss...
- Shh.

337
00:37:11.519 --> 00:37:12.508
Save your strength.

338
00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.249
Just tell me, who did this?

339
00:37:16.357 --> 00:37:19.053
The transporter.

340
00:37:20.395 --> 00:37:22.158
The transporter's dead.

341
00:37:22.263 --> 00:37:24.163
He's not.

342
00:37:29.671 --> 00:37:31.161
Believe me.

343
00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:35.065
I believe you.

344
00:37:35.176 --> 00:37:39.408
And the police?
They were here?

345
00:37:39.514 --> 00:37:40.879
No.

346
00:37:40.982 --> 00:37:42.540
You told them nothing, right?

347
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:44.550
Right.

348
00:37:44.652 --> 00:37:47.177
Of course...

349
00:37:47.288 --> 00:37:50.883
you couldn't talk.

350
00:37:50.992 --> 00:37:52.755
Yeah.

351
00:37:57.365 --> 00:37:59.060
Let's keep it that way.

352
00:38:58.393 --> 00:39:00.827
I picked them
from the garden outside.

353
00:39:00.929 --> 00:39:03.830
I hope you don't mind.

354
00:39:03.932 --> 00:39:06.833
I didn't know
if you like coffee...

355
00:39:06.935 --> 00:39:08.459
or tea,
so I made both.

356
00:39:21.549 --> 00:39:24.177
I hope you like, uh...

357
00:39:24.285 --> 00:39:26.776
"ma-de-leine."

358
00:39:26.888 --> 00:39:28.856
Try one.

359
00:39:31.926 --> 00:39:33.359
Careful.

360
00:39:33.461 --> 00:39:34.655
It's hot.

361
00:39:37.632 --> 00:39:39.031
Good?

362
00:39:45.139 --> 00:39:46.538
Let me.

363
00:39:48.443 --> 00:39:50.172
I like it quiet in the morning.

364
00:39:50.278 --> 00:39:52.303
Yes.
Quiet in the morning.

365
00:39:52.413 --> 00:39:53.710
Me, too.
Me, too.

366
00:39:53.815 --> 00:39:57.444
I'm the same way.
I like very quiet.

367
00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:01.452
Sorry.

368
00:40:07.428 --> 00:40:08.952
Are you looking for milk?

369
00:40:10.231 --> 00:40:12.495
There's milk at the door.

370
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.830
Stay, stay.
I'll go.

371
00:40:20.475 --> 00:40:21.373
Hi.

372
00:40:24.746 --> 00:40:25.770
And you are?

373
00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.007
The new cook.

374
00:40:28.116 --> 00:40:30.550
Is Monsieur Frank in?

375
00:40:30.652 --> 00:40:33.883
Ah! Monsieur Frank.

376
00:40:33.988 --> 00:40:37.048
Is your invitation
for coffee still open?

377
00:40:37.158 --> 00:40:38.785
Sure, come on.
Please, sit.

378
00:40:41.429 --> 00:40:42.396
Madeleine?

379
00:40:42.497 --> 00:40:43.395
Homemade?

380
00:40:43.498 --> 00:40:44.795
Yes.

381
00:40:44.899 --> 00:40:46.594
I'll bring some more.

382
00:40:46.701 --> 00:40:47.725
Ah.

383
00:40:47.835 --> 00:40:49.700
My mother used to make...

384
00:40:49.804 --> 00:40:51.066
fresh madeleines every morning.

385
00:40:51.172 --> 00:40:53.299
I smell them
and my whole childhood...

386
00:40:53.408 --> 00:40:55.433
comes back in one big flood...

387
00:40:55.543 --> 00:40:57.170
like Proust.

388
00:40:57.278 --> 00:40:58.905
You ever read Proust,
Monsieur Frank?

389
00:40:59.013 --> 00:41:00.480
No.

390
00:41:00.581 --> 00:41:01.741
Ah. He's fantastic.

391
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:03.749
Memory like a steel trap.

392
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:05.375
He would have been a great cop.

393
00:41:05.486 --> 00:41:06.453
A real detail man.

394
00:41:06.554 --> 00:41:08.078
- Milk?
- Please. Mmm.

395
00:41:09.924 --> 00:41:13.087
Thank you.
Ahh.

396
00:41:13.194 --> 00:41:15.594
I used to have a memory like Proust.

397
00:41:15.697 --> 00:41:17.824
Like a filing cabinet up there.

398
00:41:17.932 --> 00:41:20.423
I would see something
and remember it like that.

399
00:41:20.535 --> 00:41:22.059
Like, uh, license plates.

400
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.139
I could see a plate
and it was printed in my head.

401
00:41:25.239 --> 00:41:27.104
Now I need all
the help I can get...

402
00:41:27.208 --> 00:41:28.800
remembering whose plate...

403
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:30.275
goes with whose car.

404
00:41:30.378 --> 00:41:33.404
Like, uh, this one.

405
00:41:35.717 --> 00:41:36.684
It's mine.

406
00:41:36.784 --> 00:41:39.048
Ah, memories.

407
00:41:39.153 --> 00:41:40.313
So?

408
00:41:40.421 --> 00:41:41.581
Where's the rest
of the car?

409
00:41:41.689 --> 00:41:43.589
I was hoping
you could tell me.

410
00:41:43.691 --> 00:41:45.158
- It was stolen.
- Stolen?

411
00:41:45.259 --> 00:41:47.284
Yeah, I went down to Frejus
to pick up a few things.

412
00:41:47.395 --> 00:41:48.794
When I came out
of the market, it was...

413
00:41:48.896 --> 00:41:51.797
Gone.
Did you report it?

414
00:41:51.899 --> 00:41:54.959
It's the first on my list
of things to do today.

415
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.967
It's a long walk
from Frejus.

416
00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:57.037
How did you get home?

417
00:41:57.138 --> 00:41:58.298
Well...

418
00:41:58.406 --> 00:42:00.840
I brought him.

419
00:42:00.942 --> 00:42:03.308
I saw him walking
along the dark road.

420
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:05.402
Mm, a risky thing.

421
00:42:05.513 --> 00:42:07.811
Picking up a stranger
on a dark road.

422
00:42:08.983 --> 00:42:10.814
He had a kind face.

423
00:42:14.389 --> 00:42:16.084
I didn't see
a car outside.

424
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.316
It's in the garage.

425
00:42:17.425 --> 00:42:18.323
May I see it?

426
00:42:18.426 --> 00:42:19.688
Mm-hmm.

427
00:42:40.014 --> 00:42:42.676
Pretty nice car
for a cook.

428
00:42:44.952 --> 00:42:47.750
Some people have a problem
with the Germans.

429
00:42:47.855 --> 00:42:48.981
They're too aggressive.

430
00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:51.388
They take up
the best beaches in summer.

431
00:42:51.492 --> 00:42:53.517
They can't cook worth a damn.

432
00:42:56.697 --> 00:42:58.858
I say anyone
who makes such great cars...

433
00:42:58.966 --> 00:43:01.662
can't be all bad.

434
00:43:01.769 --> 00:43:03.430
I would say your intuition
worked out very well...

435
00:43:03.538 --> 00:43:04.505
for Monsieur Frank,
mademoiselle.

436
00:43:06.207 --> 00:43:08.869
Worked out for both of us.

437
00:43:13.347 --> 00:43:15.247
Bon.

438
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:17.579
My intuition says
this is probably a good time...

439
00:43:17.685 --> 00:43:20.119
for me to go
file my report.

440
00:43:20.221 --> 00:43:21.688
Where's the rest
of my car?

441
00:43:21.789 --> 00:43:23.051
Oh, yes.

442
00:43:23.157 --> 00:43:24.647
I almost forgot.

443
00:43:24.759 --> 00:43:26.989
It was blown to pieces
at a rest stop.

444
00:43:28.329 --> 00:43:31.264
What's left of it
is down at the lab.

445
00:43:31.365 --> 00:43:33.833
They're trying to separate
what was left...

446
00:43:33.935 --> 00:43:35.903
of the 2 cops in the trunk...

447
00:43:36.003 --> 00:43:38.096
from the rest of it.

448
00:43:38.206 --> 00:43:41.004
But, uh, you wouldn't know
anything about that?

449
00:43:41.108 --> 00:43:42.769
No.

450
00:43:42.877 --> 00:43:44.310
Sorry to interrupt.

451
00:43:44.412 --> 00:43:46.972
Thank you for the coffee
and the memories.

452
00:43:47.081 --> 00:43:48.810
Come back any time.

453
00:43:48.916 --> 00:43:50.816
Would you mind walking me?

454
00:43:50.918 --> 00:43:52.647
Come on.

455
00:43:52.753 --> 00:43:54.220
You have always
been very quiet...

456
00:43:54.322 --> 00:43:56.153
about your business,
Monsieur Frank.

457
00:43:56.257 --> 00:43:59.090
I appreciate that.
Less work for Mother.

458
00:43:59.193 --> 00:44:00.956
But this business
at the rest stop.

459
00:44:01.062 --> 00:44:03.257
That is not very quiet.

460
00:44:03.364 --> 00:44:05.025
I don't suppose you
would like to tell me...

461
00:44:05.132 --> 00:44:07.532
something besides
a stolen car story?

462
00:44:07.635 --> 00:44:09.364
If I had one I would.

463
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:12.268
Well, may I suggest
that when the 2 of you...

464
00:44:12.373 --> 00:44:14.136
show up in my office
after lunch...

465
00:44:14.242 --> 00:44:15.834
you do have one.

466
00:44:15.943 --> 00:44:18.434
A better one
than you currently have.

467
00:44:25.219 --> 00:44:27.449
You are the one
he wants to see...

468
00:44:27.555 --> 00:44:28.453
not me!

469
00:44:28.556 --> 00:44:29.989
Quiet!

470
00:44:30.091 --> 00:44:32.150
Please, I have to think.

471
00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.160
You were supposed
to think last night.

472
00:44:34.262 --> 00:44:36.662
Yeah, well,
last night I had nightmares...

473
00:44:36.764 --> 00:44:39.790
about a girl who came
into my nice, quiet life...

474
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:41.368
screwed it all up.

475
00:44:41.469 --> 00:44:42.561
Everything she touched broke...

476
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:44.535
and every move she made
turned into a catastrophe.

477
00:44:44.639 --> 00:44:46.834
OK. Sorry.

478
00:44:49.243 --> 00:44:51.609
I'm still wondering
if I want to know everything...

479
00:44:51.712 --> 00:44:53.839
or nothing about you.

480
00:45:02.323 --> 00:45:03.915
What?

481
00:45:04.025 --> 00:45:05.424
The quiet.

482
00:45:05.526 --> 00:45:07.790
I thought you liked quiet.

483
00:45:10.798 --> 00:45:13.596
Yeah, not this quiet.

484
00:45:16.604 --> 00:45:17.502
Aah!

485
00:45:33.421 --> 00:45:34.319
You OK?

486
00:45:34.422 --> 00:45:35.320
No!

487
00:45:35.423 --> 00:45:36.685
Good. Let's go.

488
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.258
Uhh!

489
00:45:42.797 --> 00:45:43.695
Aah!

490
00:45:46.634 --> 00:45:47.532
Go! Go! Go!

491
00:45:53.975 --> 00:45:54.873
Uhh!

492
00:45:58.813 --> 00:46:00.872
- Aah!
- Aah!

493
00:46:00.982 --> 00:46:02.006
No, don't stay there!

494
00:46:02.116 --> 00:46:03.208
No!

495
00:46:05.152 --> 00:46:06.084
Aah!

496
00:46:11.792 --> 00:46:13.851
Aah! Aah!

497
00:46:31.045 --> 00:46:32.342
Frank!

498
00:46:34.248 --> 00:46:35.681
Come on,
give me your hand!

499
00:46:39.687 --> 00:46:40.915
Aah!

500
00:46:48.029 --> 00:46:49.656
Uhh!

501
00:46:49.764 --> 00:46:51.959
Aah!

502
00:46:59.073 --> 00:47:01.371
- Aah!
- Come on!

503
00:47:03.577 --> 00:47:05.101
Come on, get in!
Get in!

504
00:47:05.212 --> 00:47:07.077
- No! No!
- Get in!

505
00:47:10.217 --> 00:47:12.981
Lai, look!
Come on, you wanna die?!

506
00:47:13.087 --> 00:47:14.315
Get in!

507
00:47:38.079 --> 00:47:39.478
Calm down, OK?

508
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.844
Don't worry.
You OK?

509
00:47:42.983 --> 00:47:44.245
Stay here.
I'm coming back.

510
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:46.649
No, wait! Wait!

511
00:47:51.826 --> 00:47:52.986
Uhh!

512
00:47:56.464 --> 00:47:57.897
Aah!

513
00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.527
Put it on.

514
00:48:04.071 --> 00:48:05.333
- You OK?
- Mm.

515
00:48:05.439 --> 00:48:06.872
Sure?

516
00:48:06.974 --> 00:48:08.566
OK, let's go.

517
00:49:48.008 --> 00:49:50.135
Frank?

518
00:49:50.244 --> 00:49:51.973
Is this your house?

519
00:49:55.416 --> 00:49:56.781
Frank?

520
00:49:56.884 --> 00:49:58.749
Uhh! Yeah, guess.

521
00:50:01.388 --> 00:50:03.652
Frank.

522
00:50:10.364 --> 00:50:12.832
I should mind
my own goddamn business.

523
00:50:14.835 --> 00:50:18.134
A simple rule.
A simple, little rule.

524
00:50:18.239 --> 00:50:19.536
There's gotta be
some dry clothes...

525
00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.541
in this house.

526
00:50:22.643 --> 00:50:26.055
Don't open the package.

527
00:50:26.153 --> 00:50:27.686
Nothing but trouble,
you open the goddamn package.

528
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:30.453
Frank.

529
00:50:34.623 --> 00:50:35.521
What are you doing?

530
00:50:35.624 --> 00:50:37.353
Making up for the trouble.

531
00:50:43.365 --> 00:50:44.855
Wait, wait.

532
00:50:44.966 --> 00:50:45.898
Why are you making...

533
00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:47.366
No more questions.

534
00:50:49.971 --> 00:50:50.995
Wait.

535
00:50:51.106 --> 00:50:53.040
I don't like it
when things get complicated.

536
00:50:53.141 --> 00:50:55.507
You like things simple.

537
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:57.237
Very simple.

538
00:51:13.628 --> 00:51:15.323
I'm not so clear
about the house.

539
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.762
Could you explain...

540
00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:20.198
uh, one more time.
After I left.

541
00:51:20.302 --> 00:51:22.270
After you left, we went
for a walk on the beach.

542
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:23.735
- Had a swim.
- Where again?

543
00:51:23.838 --> 00:51:24.896
Past the point.

544
00:51:25.006 --> 00:51:26.667
Anyone else swimming
at that time?

545
00:51:26.775 --> 00:51:27.673
No.

546
00:51:27.776 --> 00:51:28.970
Did you see
anybody else swimming?

547
00:51:29.077 --> 00:51:30.601
No. No one.

548
00:51:30.712 --> 00:51:35.376
So, you took a walk,
had a swim...

549
00:51:35.483 --> 00:51:37.678
on a beach where no one
else was swimming...

550
00:51:37.786 --> 00:51:40.550
past the point
where you can't see...

551
00:51:40.655 --> 00:51:43.123
or be seen from the beach
on either side...

552
00:51:43.224 --> 00:51:45.920
which makes witnesses
a little hard to come by.

553
00:51:46.027 --> 00:51:48.495
That's the point
of a romantic swim.

554
00:51:48.596 --> 00:51:50.826
Who wants witnesses?

555
00:51:53.001 --> 00:51:54.400
And then?

556
00:51:54.502 --> 00:51:55.469
Then we came back
to the house...

557
00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:56.696
found it on fire.

558
00:51:56.805 --> 00:51:58.636
Just like that?
On fire?

559
00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.071
Yes.

560
00:52:00.175 --> 00:52:03.269
And the 5,000 rounds
of spent ammo...

561
00:52:03.378 --> 00:52:05.107
my men found
all around the house?

562
00:52:05.213 --> 00:52:06.578
Maybe they had
the wrong house.

563
00:52:06.681 --> 00:52:07.943
Monsieur Frank...

564
00:52:08.049 --> 00:52:10.847
people with
this kind of firepower...

565
00:52:10.952 --> 00:52:14.046
do not make mistakes
about who they visit.

566
00:52:15.357 --> 00:52:17.052
Who would want you this dead?

567
00:52:17.158 --> 00:52:18.887
I don't know.

568
00:52:18.994 --> 00:52:20.723
Any problems with a client?

569
00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:22.956
I don't have clients.
I'm retired.

570
00:52:23.064 --> 00:52:25.931
I live on my army pension,
you know that.

571
00:52:26.034 --> 00:52:26.966
You have all the facts
of who I am...

572
00:52:27.068 --> 00:52:28.763
and who I was.
You've had them for years.

573
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:30.633
Any enemies
you can think of?

574
00:52:30.739 --> 00:52:31.671
People from the past?

575
00:52:31.773 --> 00:52:33.764
I left the past behind
when I moved here.

576
00:52:33.875 --> 00:52:38.642
Huh. A past like yours
you never leave behind.

577
00:52:39.948 --> 00:52:41.609
Commissaire,
on vous demande en bas.

578
00:52:41.716 --> 00:52:43.843
I'll just be a moment.

579
00:52:43.952 --> 00:52:45.385
Don't leave.

580
00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:00.768
What are you doing?

581
00:53:00.869 --> 00:53:02.860
Computers know everything.

582
00:53:02.971 --> 00:53:04.029
You just need a password.

583
00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:06.835
What, are you nuts?
We're in a police station.

584
00:53:06.941 --> 00:53:08.306
You're always complaining.

585
00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:11.106
Except when we make love.
Then you say nothing.

586
00:53:24.626 --> 00:53:26.719
Aha.

587
00:53:26.828 --> 00:53:29.319
Ah.

588
00:53:34.969 --> 00:53:36.698
¶ La la la

589
00:53:36.805 --> 00:53:38.136
Hello.

590
00:53:38.239 --> 00:53:39.672
See?

591
00:53:58.626 --> 00:53:59.923
So, where will you be staying?

592
00:54:00.028 --> 00:54:01.256
I don't know.

593
00:54:01.362 --> 00:54:03.887
Well, my cousin
has a small hotel.

594
00:54:05.166 --> 00:54:07.293
Thanks, but we'll manage.

595
00:54:07.402 --> 00:54:10.394
Without money,
it would be hard.

596
00:54:10.505 --> 00:54:11.563
Here.
It's not much...

597
00:54:11.673 --> 00:54:13.766
but at least
you won't go hungry.

598
00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:16.173
Thank you.

599
00:54:28.156 --> 00:54:29.054
Where are you going?

600
00:54:29.157 --> 00:54:30.488
Going to see that guy.

601
00:54:30.592 --> 00:54:31.957
Good luck.

602
00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.254
One minute.

603
00:54:33.361 --> 00:54:34.623
You're not coming?

604
00:54:34.729 --> 00:54:35.855
No.

605
00:54:35.964 --> 00:54:37.556
But he blew up your car.

606
00:54:37.665 --> 00:54:38.962
I'll buy a new one.

607
00:54:39.067 --> 00:54:40.364
He burned your house.

608
00:54:40.468 --> 00:54:41.560
I'll rebuild it.

609
00:54:41.669 --> 00:54:43.034
He tried to kill you!

610
00:54:43.138 --> 00:54:44.799
And as far as he knows,
he succeeded.

611
00:54:44.906 --> 00:54:46.168
Look, I'm going
to give you some advice.

612
00:54:46.274 --> 00:54:47.298
I don't know
what you were into.

613
00:54:47.408 --> 00:54:48.432
I don't care
what you were into.

614
00:54:48.543 --> 00:54:49.441
But whoever wanted you dead...

615
00:54:49.544 --> 00:54:50.442
thinks you're dead.

616
00:54:50.545 --> 00:54:51.876
You have a free pass
to start over.

617
00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.972
Here's the advice:
Start over!

618
00:55:00.922 --> 00:55:04.551
There are 400 people dying...

619
00:55:04.659 --> 00:55:07.457
in a container on a ship.

620
00:55:10.265 --> 00:55:12.597
My father.

621
00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:14.861
My sisters.

622
00:55:14.969 --> 00:55:17.995
The ship arrives today.

623
00:55:18.106 --> 00:55:21.303
They will make
my father a slave.

624
00:55:21.409 --> 00:55:25.505
The only one who knows
the container number...

625
00:55:25.613 --> 00:55:28.013
is that guy.

626
00:55:28.116 --> 00:55:29.947
You're very good.

627
00:55:30.051 --> 00:55:32.042
What do you mean?

628
00:55:32.153 --> 00:55:33.950
The moment you saw
those pictures in my house...

629
00:55:34.055 --> 00:55:36.148
you were setting me up
to get involved in this.

630
00:55:36.257 --> 00:55:37.281
The breakfast.

631
00:55:37.392 --> 00:55:38.882
Giving the excuse
to the cop to help me.

632
00:55:38.993 --> 00:55:40.984
One lie after another.

633
00:55:41.095 --> 00:55:44.826
Not everything is a lie.

634
00:55:44.933 --> 00:55:47.163
Name one thing
that isn't?

635
00:55:49.737 --> 00:55:52.433
What happened in the house...

636
00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.939
between us...

637
00:55:54.042 --> 00:55:56.806
that was not a lie.

638
00:55:59.981 --> 00:56:01.573
You were a soldier.

639
00:56:01.683 --> 00:56:04.481
Your job was to save people.

640
00:56:04.586 --> 00:56:05.917
Past tense.

641
00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:07.385
What does that mean?

642
00:56:07.488 --> 00:56:09.251
It means I got tired
of seeing my best efforts...

643
00:56:09.357 --> 00:56:11.052
get turned into bullshit
by the same people...

644
00:56:11.159 --> 00:56:12.990
who paid me to do the job.

645
00:56:13.094 --> 00:56:14.254
No one cared.

646
00:56:14.362 --> 00:56:18.196
This time... I care.

647
00:56:34.315 --> 00:56:35.748
Thank you.

648
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:47.027
Bonjour.

649
00:56:47.128 --> 00:56:48.186
Bonjour.

650
00:56:48.296 --> 00:56:49.763
No phone calls
for half an hour?

651
00:56:50.965 --> 00:56:52.694
Hello. Surprise!

652
00:56:59.641 --> 00:57:00.869
Sit.

653
00:57:13.488 --> 00:57:14.716
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

654
00:57:16.391 --> 00:57:18.325
So, before we get
to the heart of the matter...

655
00:57:18.426 --> 00:57:20.326
I have one question for you.

656
00:57:20.428 --> 00:57:21.725
Why'd you try to kill me?

657
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:23.228
You lied to me.

658
00:57:23.331 --> 00:57:24.798
You opened the package.

659
00:57:24.899 --> 00:57:26.127
You broke the rules.

660
00:57:26.234 --> 00:57:27.132
Your rules.

661
00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:28.327
What did you
expect me to do...

662
00:57:28.436 --> 00:57:30.370
recommend you for another job?

663
00:57:33.941 --> 00:57:35.602
What's the ship number?

664
00:57:38.513 --> 00:57:40.344
Mr. Transporter...

665
00:57:40.448 --> 00:57:41.779
we can both agree...

666
00:57:41.883 --> 00:57:43.851
I answered your first
question politely.

667
00:57:43.951 --> 00:57:45.680
I won't answer any more...

668
00:57:45.787 --> 00:57:49.780
so I suggest
you kill me right now...

669
00:57:49.891 --> 00:57:52.553
and go screw yourself.

670
00:57:54.729 --> 00:57:56.629
I can't find anything.

671
00:58:03.571 --> 00:58:06.131
Oh, poor Frank.
What did she tell you?

672
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.708
We're smuggling people
in containers?

673
00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.438
I tell you, "Lai"'s
the perfect name for her.

674
00:58:11.546 --> 00:58:12.945
Mr. Kwai's on the way up.

675
00:58:13.047 --> 00:58:13.945
Your father's here.

676
00:58:14.048 --> 00:58:16.073
He'll really get
a kick out of this.

677
00:58:16.184 --> 00:58:17.776
I thought your father
was in a container.

678
00:58:17.885 --> 00:58:19.682
Yes! I... I mean, no.

679
00:58:19.787 --> 00:58:22.278
There are 400 people
in that container.

680
00:58:23.391 --> 00:58:25.052
Stay where you are!

681
00:58:25.159 --> 00:58:27.650
She's a real heartbreaker,
isn't she, Frank?

682
00:58:29.931 --> 00:58:31.956
10 seconds, 2 choices.

683
00:58:32.066 --> 00:58:34.466
The information on the paper
or your brains on the desk!

684
00:58:34.569 --> 00:58:35.729
Now tell me I'm lying!

685
00:58:35.837 --> 00:58:37.304
- 9... 8...
- Lai.

686
00:58:37.405 --> 00:58:38.997
Lai, give me
the gun.

687
00:58:39.107 --> 00:58:40.233
I don't know
what you're talking about.

688
00:58:40.341 --> 00:58:42.070
...6... 5...

689
00:58:42.176 --> 00:58:43.871
4... 3...

690
00:58:43.978 --> 00:58:44.876
2...

691
00:58:44.979 --> 00:58:46.241
...one.

692
00:58:46.347 --> 00:58:47.473
Shoot.

693
00:58:51.819 --> 00:58:52.843
Lai!

694
00:59:00.928 --> 00:59:03.795
Would I kill
my own daughter?

695
00:59:03.898 --> 00:59:06.799
Lai.

696
00:59:06.901 --> 00:59:09.495
Come on now.

697
00:59:09.604 --> 00:59:10.798
Put it down.

698
00:59:14.242 --> 00:59:15.709
We'll talk.

699
00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:19.541
She thinks we're smuggling
people in containers.

700
00:59:21.182 --> 00:59:22.444
I don't know where
you get these ideas!

701
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:23.539
Stay away!

702
00:59:28.156 --> 00:59:30.886
Would you kill
your own father?

703
00:59:30.992 --> 00:59:32.550
Please...

704
00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:34.215
I am begging you.

705
00:59:34.324 --> 00:59:36.015
Stop what you are doing.

706
00:59:36.123 --> 00:59:37.848
I do what I do.

707
00:59:37.954 --> 00:59:39.213
I am who I am.

708
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.443
I'll never change.

709
00:59:40.552 --> 00:59:42.913
So if you're
going to kill me...

710
00:59:43.017 --> 00:59:44.072
kill me.

711
00:59:44.183 --> 00:59:46.170
But if you don't...

712
00:59:46.281 --> 00:59:47.540
get this gun
out of my face!

713
00:59:51.376 --> 00:59:52.431
Give me.

714
00:59:52.542 --> 00:59:53.507
No!

715
00:59:54.607 --> 00:59:56.003
I know he's innocent.

716
00:59:56.105 --> 00:59:57.898
Oh, you have
such a good heart.

717
00:59:58.003 --> 01:00:01.091
Always interested in
saving innocent people.

718
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.823
Well, here's
your big chance.

719
01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.089
Drop your gun...

720
01:00:04.197 --> 01:00:06.683
and you will save one.

721
01:00:12.157 --> 01:00:13.745
- Kill him!
- No!

722
01:00:16.786 --> 01:00:18.216
The police are
on their way up.

723
01:00:18.318 --> 01:00:19.782
- What now?
- Take her.

724
01:00:22.181 --> 01:00:23.406
Send in Leo.

725
01:00:23.513 --> 01:00:25.034
I need him to wrap
something up.

726
01:00:41.331 --> 01:00:42.353
Just for the record...

727
01:00:42.463 --> 01:00:44.653
there aren't 400 people
in that container.

728
01:00:44.761 --> 01:00:48.689
Only 395 made it here alive.

729
01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:50.447
Frank!

730
01:00:53.919 --> 01:00:56.008
Inspector.
Am I glad you're here.

731
01:00:57.216 --> 01:00:57.382
What is this?

732
01:00:57.383 --> 01:00:58.279
What is this?

733
01:00:58.382 --> 01:01:00.312
This man used
my partner's daughter here...

734
01:01:00.413 --> 01:01:01.775
to try and blackmail us.

735
01:01:01.878 --> 01:01:04.433
Luckily, my security
got the drop on him.

736
01:01:05.542 --> 01:01:07.267
I wanna press charges...
kidnapping...

737
01:01:07.374 --> 01:01:08.668
extortion, assault.

738
01:01:08.772 --> 01:01:10.031
I know this man.

739
01:01:10.138 --> 01:01:11.931
Well, I suppose
in your business...

740
01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:14.057
you have to know all types.

741
01:01:16.199 --> 01:01:18.095
Now, should I call my lawyer?

742
01:01:18.197 --> 01:01:19.785
We'll handle it.

743
01:01:25.158 --> 01:01:26.588
I'll expect all of you...

744
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:28.415
down at my office
to give your statements.

745
01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:30.314
As soon as I contact
my lawyer...

746
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.407
we'll be more
than happy to oblige.

747
01:01:40.377 --> 01:01:42.466
Ohh. Mmm...

748
01:01:52.199 --> 01:01:53.561
The doctor said
you will have a headache...

749
01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:55.425
for a few days
and then everything...

750
01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:56.789
will go back to normal.

751
01:01:56.895 --> 01:01:57.825
Where are they?

752
01:01:57.927 --> 01:02:00.447
Ah, I think you should
be more concerned...

753
01:02:00.558 --> 01:02:02.783
with where you are.

754
01:02:04.522 --> 01:02:06.281
What got into you?

755
01:02:06.387 --> 01:02:07.874
You were always so careful.

756
01:02:07.985 --> 01:02:09.540
I've got to get out of here.

757
01:02:09.651 --> 01:02:11.944
Oh, well,
with the charges they filed...

758
01:02:12.048 --> 01:02:13.239
you will not be getting out...

759
01:02:13.347 --> 01:02:14.868
for a very long time.

760
01:02:16.012 --> 01:02:17.374
Assaulting a distinguished member...

761
01:02:17.477 --> 01:02:19.906
of the international
business community...

762
01:02:20.008 --> 01:02:21.404
kidnapping his daughter...

763
01:02:21.506 --> 01:02:22.402
extortion.

764
01:02:23.538 --> 01:02:25.434
I'm sorry, Frank.

765
01:02:25.536 --> 01:02:27.466
I would like to help you...

766
01:02:27.568 --> 01:02:30.054
but if you continue
with the same old story...

767
01:02:30.165 --> 01:02:32.594
"I am retired,
living on a pension..."

768
01:02:34.095 --> 01:02:36.059
I need fresh, Frank.

769
01:02:36.159 --> 01:02:37.646
I need new.

770
01:02:37.758 --> 01:02:39.914
For once,
I need the truth.

771
01:02:42.953 --> 01:02:45.042
OK.

772
01:02:45.151 --> 01:02:47.273
They're smuggling people.

773
01:02:47.383 --> 01:02:48.642
From Asia through Marseilles...

774
01:02:48.748 --> 01:02:50.076
in containers.

775
01:02:52.678 --> 01:02:53.767
You know this for fact?

776
01:02:53.877 --> 01:02:55.841
The girl told me.

777
01:02:55.942 --> 01:02:57.031
You believe her?

778
01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.661
Yes.

779
01:02:58.772 --> 01:02:59.737
In French we have a saying...

780
01:02:59.838 --> 01:03:01.200
"Never believe the cook."

781
01:03:03.702 --> 01:03:04.667
She's not the cook.

782
01:03:04.767 --> 01:03:06.288
Oh.

783
01:03:06.399 --> 01:03:08.555
I suspected.

784
01:03:08.663 --> 01:03:09.888
You know, Frank...

785
01:03:09.996 --> 01:03:10.961
no one is perfect.

786
01:03:11.062 --> 01:03:12.356
So you're saying
you're gonna do nothing?

787
01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.822
No, I'm saying...

788
01:03:13.925 --> 01:03:16.014
I'm going to start
an investigation.

789
01:03:16.123 --> 01:03:17.610
And in the meantime,
the 400 people...

790
01:03:17.722 --> 01:03:19.345
in that container
could be dead already.

791
01:03:19.454 --> 01:03:21.384
But what am I
supposed to do?

792
01:03:21.485 --> 01:03:22.415
There are laws.

793
01:03:22.518 --> 01:03:23.777
Did it ever occur
to you that sometimes...

794
01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:24.870
you have to make
your own law?

795
01:03:24.982 --> 01:03:26.004
Like you do?

796
01:03:26.114 --> 01:03:27.442
At least with me,
it doesn't take 12 months...

797
01:03:27.546 --> 01:03:28.442
to get the job done.

798
01:03:28.546 --> 01:03:29.442
Oh, yes, I know.

799
01:03:29.545 --> 01:03:32.269
That's what I admire
about you, Frank.

800
01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.737
All that army training...

801
01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.303
all that sneaking around...

802
01:03:36.406 --> 01:03:38.427
a man like you could
probably resolve this case...

803
01:03:38.536 --> 01:03:39.966
in, how long?

804
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:42.158
12 hours?

805
01:03:42.266 --> 01:03:43.457
Less.

806
01:03:43.566 --> 01:03:45.053
Less?

807
01:03:45.164 --> 01:03:46.821
Impressive.

808
01:03:46.929 --> 01:03:49.154
You would be the perfect man
for the job.

809
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.383
Yes...

810
01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:51.821
if I were out.

811
01:03:51.925 --> 01:03:52.821
Yes...

812
01:03:52.924 --> 01:03:54.581
if you were out.

813
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:17.263
Anybody moves
and I kill him.

814
01:04:17.368 --> 01:04:19.695
Personne ne bouge.
Baissez vos armes.

815
01:04:19.799 --> 01:04:21.989
Ce type est dingue
et capable de tout.

816
01:04:30.023 --> 01:04:31.078
¶ I met him in the Bahamas

817
01:04:31.189 --> 01:04:32.777
¶ I love
¶ that nigga persona

818
01:04:32.888 --> 01:04:34.113

¶ Lay on the bed,

821
01:04:36.884 --> 01:04:38.405
¶ Bone him until tomorrow

822
01:04:38.516 --> 01:04:40.003
¶ Make him sing
¶ high soprano

823
01:04:40.114 --> 01:04:41.408
¶ Ahh

824
01:04:41.513 --> 01:04:42.670
¶ 54-50-50

825
01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:44.072

¶ Money will multiply

829
01:04:48.306 --> 01:04:49.600
¶ Before you run up inside

830
01:04:49.706 --> 01:04:52.464
¶ Make me all weak
¶ and tired, mm-hmm

831
01:04:54.235 --> 01:04:55.994
If this is
how you transport...

832
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.792
I'm amazed you get
any work at all.

833
01:04:58.899 --> 01:05:00.296
Come on and give me a hand.

834
01:05:09.798 --> 01:05:11.388
Maybe I should go with you?

835
01:05:12.864 --> 01:05:14.124
Thanks, but, uh,
I'm better alone.

836
01:05:15.897 --> 01:05:17.157
That is a very small boat...

837
01:05:17.263 --> 01:05:18.751
to fight a very big war.

838
01:05:18.864 --> 01:05:20.726
Yep.

839
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:22.351
But it's a good boat.

840
01:05:22.463 --> 01:05:24.088
Frank, here.

841
01:05:25.629 --> 01:05:26.616
You'll need it.

842
01:05:30.062 --> 01:05:32.118
Or maybe not.

843
01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:01.205
The shipment's cleared.

844
01:07:01.316 --> 01:07:02.542
Here's the paperwork.

845
01:07:02.649 --> 01:07:03.875
Take the highway
all the way...

846
01:07:03.982 --> 01:07:05.572
to the first exit... Lyon.

847
01:07:05.682 --> 01:07:07.409
Go straight
to the warehouse.

848
01:07:07.515 --> 01:07:09.412
We'll be right behind you
just in case.

849
01:07:26.246 --> 01:07:28.302
OK, we are ready to go.

850
01:07:34.911 --> 01:07:35.841
Lai, dear...

851
01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:46.004
I spent thousands of dollars...

852
01:07:46.111 --> 01:07:48.474
for you to go to school
and learn English.

853
01:07:48.577 --> 01:07:50.304
The least you can do
is speak it.

854
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:51.739
I hate you.

855
01:07:56.142 --> 01:07:58.369
I'm still your father.

856
01:07:59.808 --> 01:08:01.569
Get her out of here!

857
01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:19.870
Aah!

858
01:08:21.339 --> 01:08:22.895
Give me a minute.

859
01:08:23.005 --> 01:08:24.265
Ohh!

860
01:08:28.004 --> 01:08:28.900
Aah!

861
01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:30.026
Aah!

862
01:08:31.537 --> 01:08:32.524
Yah!

863
01:08:32.637 --> 01:08:33.727
Uhh!

864
01:08:44.502 --> 01:08:45.558
Aah!

865
01:08:50.068 --> 01:08:51.226
Keep him alive.

866
01:09:34.795 --> 01:09:35.782
Let's go!

867
01:10:33.588 --> 01:10:34.597
No, don't!

868
01:10:37.128 --> 01:10:38.207
Let's go!

869
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:03.304
Aah!

870
01:12:14.917 --> 01:12:16.135
Ohh!

871
01:12:21.965 --> 01:12:22.881
Ohh...

872
01:12:36.777 --> 01:12:38.273
Ohh...

873
01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.692
Ohh...

874
01:12:45.425 --> 01:12:46.539
Uhh!

875
01:13:07.897 --> 01:13:10.346
Ohh! Aah!

876
01:13:10.451 --> 01:13:11.600
Ohh!

877
01:14:08.913 --> 01:14:10.851
Oh, shit!

878
01:14:10.956 --> 01:14:12.987
- Aah!

879
01:16:23.951 --> 01:16:24.867
Ohh!

880
01:16:24.972 --> 01:16:25.888
Ohh!

881
01:16:33.008 --> 01:16:35.016
¶ Get ready-ready-ready
¶ to rock

882
01:16:35.017 --> 01:16:37.431
¶ Get ready-ready-ready
¶ to rock

883
01:16:37.536 --> 01:16:39.846
¶ Get ready-ready-ready
¶ to rock

884
01:17:12.846 --> 01:17:14.040
Bitch!

885
01:17:59.526 --> 01:18:00.424
Good morning.

886
01:18:00.527 --> 01:18:01.425
Good morning.

887
01:18:01.528 --> 01:18:03.462
Oh...

888
01:18:03.563 --> 01:18:05.121
I'm looking to do
a little sightseeing.

889
01:18:05.231 --> 01:18:06.960
This plane is not for tourists.

890
01:18:09.969 --> 01:18:11.266
I'm not a tourist.

891
01:18:35.328 --> 01:18:37.558
Call this guy
and tell him to meet me.

892
01:18:37.664 --> 01:18:38.562
Sure.

893
01:18:38.665 --> 01:18:40.030
Where?

894
01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:43.033
Down there.

895
01:19:11.831 --> 01:19:12.729
Here!

896
01:19:18.705 --> 01:19:19.603
Careful!

897
01:19:38.891 --> 01:19:40.449
Ohh! Aah!

898
01:19:59.078 --> 01:20:01.911
Ohh... Aah!

899
01:20:03.916 --> 01:20:04.974
Move up.

900
01:20:28.408 --> 01:20:29.670
Get down.

901
01:20:50.129 --> 01:20:51.357
Aah!

902
01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:55.198
Aah!

903
01:21:22.295 --> 01:21:23.523
Ahh!

904
01:22:22.088 --> 01:22:23.055
Get closer!

905
01:22:28.227 --> 01:22:29.751
- Steady!
- No, Dad, stop!

906
01:22:34.367 --> 01:22:35.595
- Get away!
- Aah!

907
01:22:50.349 --> 01:22:51.373
Aah!

908
01:23:14.807 --> 01:23:15.933
Aah!

909
01:23:17.043 --> 01:23:18.271
Aah!

910
01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:22.275
Aah!

911
01:23:22.381 --> 01:23:23.405
Aah!

912
01:23:26.586 --> 01:23:27.484
Aah!

913
01:24:01.454 --> 01:24:03.149
Down!

914
01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:15.928
Hands on your head.

915
01:24:17.336 --> 01:24:18.530
Move!

916
01:24:21.007 --> 01:24:22.235
Watch her.

917
01:24:22.341 --> 01:24:23.808
If she moves
or I don't return...

918
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:25.241
shoot her!

919
01:24:27.847 --> 01:24:29.747
To the water.

920
01:24:29.849 --> 01:24:31.646
I'm really not
in the mood for a swim.

921
01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:32.649
March!

922
01:24:35.454 --> 01:24:37.615
So, how did
a lowlife like you...

923
01:24:37.723 --> 01:24:38.883
end up with my daughter?

924
01:24:38.991 --> 01:24:41.084
Found her in a bag.
Isn't that where you left her?

925
01:24:41.193 --> 01:24:42.182
You know nothing.

926
01:24:42.295 --> 01:24:43.353
Move!

927
01:24:48.067 --> 01:24:49.329
You got involved
with the wrong girl...

928
01:24:49.435 --> 01:24:50.402
you dumb shit.

929
01:24:50.503 --> 01:24:52.971
The delivery will be made.

930
01:24:53.072 --> 01:24:54.266
My daughter
will get over it.

931
01:24:54.373 --> 01:24:56.705
If I'm lucky,
maybe she'll see the light.

932
01:25:02.581 --> 01:25:05.778
Yeah, if she's lucky
maybe you'll get hit by a truck.

933
01:25:05.885 --> 01:25:07.284
What do you know?

934
01:25:07.386 --> 01:25:09.445
I know she'll never stop
being who she is...

935
01:25:09.555 --> 01:25:12.115
and she'll never be you
or anything like you.

936
01:25:12.224 --> 01:25:13.691
She'll come around...

937
01:25:13.793 --> 01:25:15.385
but you won't be here
to see it.

938
01:25:15.494 --> 01:25:17.018
No!

939
01:25:26.973 --> 01:25:31.307
I guess she won't be
coming around after all.

940
01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:34.038
Turn around!

941
01:25:34.146 --> 01:25:35.613
I'd rather see it coming.

942
01:25:35.715 --> 01:25:37.546
Makes no difference to me.

943
01:26:03.175 --> 01:26:05.370
He was a bastard...

944
01:26:05.478 --> 01:26:08.140
but he was still
my father.

945
01:26:22.328 --> 01:26:24.125
Pretty impressive timing, Frank.

946
01:26:27.833 --> 01:26:30.358
I guess I underestimated you.

¶ Nadia Fares - Life of a Stranger

949
01:27:34.542 --> 01:27:37.250
¶ You saved my heart

950
01:27:37.375 --> 01:27:40.417
¶ You don't even know me

951
01:27:40.542 --> 01:27:43.292
¶ You saved my dream

952
01:27:43.417 --> 01:27:46.500
¶ You heard me scream
¶ Whoa

953
01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:52.208
¶ My lost soul
¶ was saved by a stranger

954
01:27:52.375 --> 01:27:58.750
¶ Who saved my life
¶ You saved my life

955
01:28:12.542 --> 01:28:15.333
¶ Why did you do it

956
01:28:15.458 --> 01:28:18.917
¶ What made you stop and turn around

957
01:28:19.042 --> 01:28:24.292
¶ Do you even know the reason
¶ Why you had to help me out

958
01:28:24.417 --> 01:28:27.375
¶ Just when I knew it

959
01:28:27.542 --> 01:28:30.667
¶ It was my time to sink or swim

960
01:28:30.792 --> 01:28:33.500
¶ You came along and pulled me out

961
01:28:33.625 --> 01:28:36.417
¶ Of all the trouble I was in

962
01:28:36.542 --> 01:28:39.417
¶ Why did you do it

963
01:28:39.542 --> 01:28:42.417
¶ Why did you risk your life for mine

964
01:28:42.542 --> 01:28:49.250
¶ Who'd have done the same for you
¶ Who'd have saved you just in time

965
01:28:49.375 --> 01:28:52.208
¶ You saved my heart

966
01:28:52.333 --> 01:28:55.542
¶ You don't even know me

967
01:28:55.667 --> 01:29:00.333
¶ You saved my dream
¶ You heard me scream

968
01:29:00.458 --> 01:29:04.208
¶ Ooh
¶ You saved my soul

969
01:29:04.333 --> 01:29:07.375
¶ Love that you have shown me

970
01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.125
¶ You saved my life

971
01:29:10.292 --> 01:29:14.167
¶ You saved my life

972
01:29:18.458 --> 01:29:21.375
¶ Where did you come from

973
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.833
¶ How did you know I was alone

974
01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:30.417
¶ That I never stood a chance
¶ To find a way out on my own

975
01:29:30.542 --> 01:29:33.375
¶ You sent a message

976
01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:36.708
¶ That I was hanging by a thread

977
01:29:36.833 --> 01:29:42.417
¶ By this very time tomorrow
¶ They will leave me here for dead

978
01:29:42.542 --> 01:29:45.375
¶ Why did you do it

979
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:48.375
¶ Why did you risk your life for mine

980
01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:55.208
¶ Who'd have done the same for you
¶ Who'd have saved you just in time

981
01:29:55.333 --> 01:29:58.417
¶ You saved my heart

982
01:29:58.542 --> 01:30:01.292
¶ You don't even know me

983
01:30:01.417 --> 01:30:04.208
¶ You saved my dream

984
01:30:04.333 --> 01:30:07.500
¶ You heard me scream
¶ Whoa

985
01:30:07.625 --> 01:30:13.167
¶ My lost soul
¶ Was saved my a stranger

986
01:30:13.292 --> 01:30:16.083
¶ Who saved my life

987
01:30:16.208 --> 01:30:19.583
¶ You saved my life

988
01:30:21.375 --> 01:30:24.250
¶ Save my life
¶ (Save my life)

989
01:30:24.375 --> 01:30:26.458
¶ Save my heart

990
01:30:26.583 --> 01:30:31.250
¶ (Save my heart,
¶ and you don't even know me)

991
01:30:31.375 --> 01:30:36.208
¶ Ooh Save my soul
¶ (Save my soul)

992
01:30:36.333 --> 01:30:40.083
¶ Save my dream
¶ (Save my dream)

993
01:30:40.208 --> 01:30:43.667
¶ Save my life

994
01:30:43.875 --> 01:30:45.417
¶ Ooh

995
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:49.750
¶ You saved my heart
¶ (Saved my heart)

996
01:30:49.875 --> 01:30:52.958
¶ You don't even know me
¶ (You don't know)

997
01:30:53.083 --> 01:30:55.375
¶ You saved my dream
¶ (Saved my dream)

998
01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:58.417
¶ You heard me scream
¶ Whoa

999
01:30:58.542 --> 01:31:01.375
¶ My lost soul
¶ (My lost soul)

1000
01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:04.458
¶ Was saved by a stranger
¶ (Saved by love)

1001
01:31:04.583 --> 01:31:07.167
¶ Who saved my life
¶ (Saved my life)

1002
01:31:07.292 --> 01:31:10.333
¶ You saved my life

1003
01:31:10.458 --> 01:31:13.375
¶ You saved my heart
¶ (Saved my heart)

1004
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:16.500
¶ You don't even know me
¶ (You don't know)

1005
01:31:16.625 --> 01:31:19.458
¶ You saved my dream
¶ (Saved my dream)

1006
01:31:19.583 --> 01:31:22.375
¶ You heard me scream
¶ Whoa

1007
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.208
¶ My lost soul
¶ (My lost soul)

1008

¶ You saved my life
