<i>Yes. I'll bring some more.</i>

375
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.900
Ah. My mother used to make
fresh madeleines every morning.

376
00:40:43.983 --> 00:40:48.279
I smell them, and my whole
childhood comes back in one big flood.

377
00:40:48.363 --> 00:40:51.741

You ever read Proust, Monsieur Frank?

378

- Ah.

384

385
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.262
I would see something
and remember it like that.

386
00:41:13.346 --> 00:41:17.976
Like, uh, license plates. I could see a plate,
and it was printed in my head.

387
00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:20.228
Now l need
all the help I can get...

388

389
00:41:23.398 --> 00:41:26.275
Like, uh, this one.

390
00:41:28.528 --> 00:41:30.780
- That's mine.
- Ah.

391
00:41:30.863 --> 00:41:33.157

- So?

392
00:41:33.241 --> 00:41:35.994
- Where's the rest of the car?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

393
00:41:36.077 --> 00:41:37.996
- It was stolen.
- Stolen?

394
00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:41.624
I went down to Fréjus to pick up a few things.
When I came out of the market, it was-

395
00:41:41.708 --> 00:41:43.710
Gone.

396
00:41:43.793 --> 00:41:46.879
- You report it?
- That's the first on my list of things to do today.

397
00:41:46.963 --> 00:41:49.882
It's a long walk from Fréjus.
How did you get home?

398
00:41:49.966 --> 00:41:51.926
<i>I brought him.</i>

399
00:41:53.761 --> 00:41:56.139
I saw him walking along
the dark road.

400
00:41:56.222 --> 00:42:00.727
A risky thing, picking up a stranger
on a dark road.

401
00:42:01.769 --> 00:42:03.730
He had a kind face.

402
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:10.153
- I didn't see a car outside.
- It's in the garage.

403
00:42:10.236 --> 00:42:12.613

- Mm-hmm.

405
00:42:32.842 --> 00:42:35.595
Ah. Pretty nice car
for a cook.

406
00:42:37.764 --> 00:42:40.725
Some people have a problem
with the Germans.

407
00:42:40.808 --> 00:42:44.353
They are too aggressive.
They take up the best beaches in summer.

408
00:42:44.437 --> 00:42:46.439
They can't cook worth a damn.

such great cars can't be all bad.

411
00:42:59.035 --> 00:43:01.496

<i>Bon.</i> Uh-

413
00:43:08.294 --> 00:43:10.421

this is...

414
00:43:10.505 --> 00:43:12.965
probably a good time
for me to go file my report.

415
00:43:13.049 --> 00:43:15.885
- Where's the rest of my car?
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>

416
00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:19.847
I almost forgot.
It was blown to pieces at a rest stop.

417
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.393
What's left of it
is down at the lab.

418
00:43:24.477 --> 00:43:28.689
They are trying to separate
what was left of the two cops in the trunk...

419
00:43:28.773 --> 00:43:31.067
from the rest of it.

420
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.195
But, uh, you wouldn't know
anything about that.

421
00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:37.156
- No.
- Sorry to interrupt.

422
00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.826
Thank you for the coffee
and the memories.

423

Come back anytime.

424
00:43:41.744 --> 00:43:45.498
- Would you mind walking me?
- No.

425
00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:49.127
You have always been very quiet
about your business, Monsieur Frank.

426
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:52.171
I appreciate that.
Less work for mother.

427
00:43:52.255 --> 00:43:56.092
But this business at the rest stop.
That is not very quiet.

428
00:43:56.175 --> 00:44:00.638
I don't suppose you would like to tell me
something besides a stolen car story?

429
00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:03.724
- If I had one, I would.
- Well, may I suggest...

430
00:44:03.808 --> 00:44:06.769

show up in my office after lunch...

431

00:44:20.366 --> 00:44:22.827
- not me.
- Quiet!

435
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.996

437
00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:29.667

I had nightmares...

438
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:34.213
about a girl who came into my nice, quiet life,
screwed it all up.

439
00:44:34.297 --> 00:44:37.383
Everything she touched broke, and every move
she made turned into a catastrophe.

Okay. Sorry.

441
00:44:42.054 --> 00:44:46.767

everything or nothing about you.

00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:56.861

had a swim... on a beach where
no one else was swimming...

past the point, where you can't see or be seen
from the beach on either side...

505
