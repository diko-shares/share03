00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.270
<i>Saigon.</i>

2
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.273
<i>Shit.</i>

3
00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.027
<i>I'm still only in Saigon.</i>

4
00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:41.081
<i>Every time, I think
I'm gonna wake up, back in the jungle.</i>

5
00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:50.540
<i>When I was home after my first tour,
it was worse.</i>

6
00:04:59.124 --> 00:05:01.226
<i>I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.</i>

7
00:05:09.534 --> 00:05:13.663
<i>I hardly said a word to my wife,
until I said "yes" to a divorce.</i>

8
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.136
<i>When I was here, I wanted to be there.</i>

9
00:05:20.395 --> 00:05:25.233
<i>When I was there, all I could think
of was getting back into the jungle.</i>

10
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:30.288
<i>I'm here a week, now.</i>

11
00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.736
<i>Waiting for a mission.</i>

12
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.463
<i>Getting softer.</i>

13
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.972
<i>Every minute I stay in this room,
I get weaker.</i>

14
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.516
<i>And every minute
Charlie squats in the bush,</i>

15
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.126
<i>he gets stronger.</i>

16
00:05:56.473 --> 00:06:00.293
<i>Each time I looked around,
the walls moved in a little tighter.</i>

17
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.545
<i>Everyone gets everything he wants.</i>

18
00:07:43.788 --> 00:07:45.340
<i>I wanted a mission.</i>

19
00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.677
<i>And for my sins, they gave me one.</i>

20
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.130
<i>Brought it up to me like room service.</i>

21
00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.934
Captain Willard, are you in there?

22
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.269
Yeah, I'm coming.

23
00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.064
<i>It was a real choice mission.</i>

24
00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:05.710
<i>And when it was over,
I'd never want another.</i>

25
00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.871
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?

26
00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:18.873
What does it look like?

27
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.802
- Are you Captain Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.

28
00:08:30.985 --> 00:08:32.470
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.

29
00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.432
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, you gonna shut the door?

30
00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.545
We have orders
to escort you to the airfield.

31
00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:45.650
- What are the charges?
- Sir?

32
00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:47.035
What'd I do?

33
00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.029
There's no charges, Captain.

34
00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:53.174
You have orders to report to 
COMSEC Intelligence, at Nha Trang.

35
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:56.119
- I see.
- All right?

36
00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.705
- Nha Trang for me?
- That's right.

37
00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:02.259
Come on, Captain. You still
have a few hours to get cleaned up.

38
00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:05.395
- I'm not feeling too good...
- Captain?

39
00:09:07.497 --> 00:09:10.050
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

40
00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:12.427
Come on, Captain. Let's take a shower.

41
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.521
- Don't be an ass.
- Get hold of him good.

42
00:09:14.545 --> 00:09:16.415
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.

43
00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.683
- In we go.
- Now, stand underneath this, Captain.

44
00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.631
<i>I was going to 
the worst place in the world</i>

45
00:09:33.715 --> 00:09:35.884
<i>and I didn't even know it yet.</i>

46
00:09:37.193 --> 00:09:39.788
<i>Weeks away and 
hundreds of miles up a river</i>

47
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.332
<i>that snaked through the war
like a main circuit cable,</i>

48
00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:44.901
<i>plugged straight into Kurtz.</i>

49
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.796
Insult me again
and I'll kick your ass.

50
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:51.024
<i>It was no accident
that I got to be the caretaker</i>

51
00:09:51.107 --> 00:09:53.526
<i>of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory,</i>

52
00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:57.280
<i>any more than being back
in Saigon was an accident.</i>

53
00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:02.510
<i>There is no way to tell his
story without telling my own.</i>

54
00:10:03.261 --> 00:10:05.163
<i>And if his story is really a confession...</i>

55
00:10:05.346 --> 00:10:06.373
Captain Willard reporting, sir.

56
00:10:06.597 --> 00:10:07.458
<i>Then so is mine.</i>

57
00:10:07.682 --> 00:10:10.944
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

58
00:10:11.227 --> 00:10:14.605
- Stand at ease.
- General.

59
00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:17.585
Do you want a cigarette?

60
00:10:19.068 --> 00:10:20.520
No, thank you, sir.

61
00:10:22.238 --> 00:10:24.666
Captain, have you ever 
seen this gentleman before?

62
00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:26.126
No, sir.

63
00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:29.003
- Met the General or myself?
- No, sir.

64
00:10:29.187 --> 00:10:30.438
Not personally.

65
00:10:31.914 --> 00:10:33.884
You've worked a lot on your own,
haven't you, Captain?

66
00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:35.426
Yes, sir, I have.

67
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.837
Your report specifies Intelligence,

68
00:10:36.861 --> 00:10:38.980
Counterintelligence with COMSEC, I Corps.

69
00:10:39.464 --> 00:10:41.883
I'm not presently disposed
to discuss those operations, sir.

70
00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:53.461
Did you not work for the CIA in I Corps?

71
00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:56.948
No, sir.

72
00:10:57.131 --> 00:10:59.701
Did you not assassinate 
a government tax collector,

73
00:10:59.884 --> 00:11:02.762
Quang Tri province, June 18, 1968?

74
00:11:05.448 --> 00:11:06.641
Captain?

75
00:11:08.326 --> 00:11:12.955
Sir, I am unaware
of any such activity or operation,

76
00:11:14.756 --> 00:11:19.095
Nor would I be disposed 
to discuss such an operation

77
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.639
if it did, in fact, exist, sir.

78
00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.778
I thought we'd have
a bite of lunch while we talk.

79
00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.490
I hope you brought a good appetite,
Captain.

80
00:11:40.016 --> 00:11:42.059
I noticed that you have a...

81
00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:45.205
...bad hand, there. 
Are you wounded?

82
00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:47.790
I had a little fishing accident
on R&R, sir.

83
00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:50.752
- "Fishing on R&R?"
- Yes, sir.

84
00:11:51.035 --> 00:11:53.254
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

85
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.624
Oh yes, General. Very much so, sir.

86
00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:57.717
Well, let's see what we have, here.

87
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.179
Roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

88
00:12:03.172 --> 00:12:05.675
Try some, Jerry, and pass it around.

89
00:12:06.442 --> 00:12:09.329
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

90
00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:15.735
Captain, I don't know how
you feel about this shrimp,

91
00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:18.071
but, if you'll eat it,

92
00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:21.324
you'll never have to prove
your courage in any other way.

93
00:12:22.567 --> 00:12:25.570
Right, well,
why don't I just take a piece, here?

94
00:12:26.421 --> 00:12:29.591
Captain, you've heard of 
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

95
00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.320
Uh, yes, sir, 
I've heard the name.

96
00:12:34.513 --> 00:12:36.181
Oh, Jesus...

97
00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:38.967
Operations Officer, Fifth Special Forces.

98
00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:42.236
Luke, would you play that
tape for the Captain, please?

99
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.490
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.

100
00:12:48.209 --> 00:12:50.937
<i>October 9, 0430 hours.
Sector: Peter, Victor, King.</i>

101
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.031
These were monitored out of Cambodia.

102
00:12:54.624 --> 00:12:56.959
This has been
verified as Colonel Kurtz's voice.

103
00:12:57.043 --> 00:12:59.912
<i>I watched... a snail...</i>

104
00:13:01.455 --> 00:13:03.207
<i>crawl along the edge...</i>

105
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.060
<i>of a straight razor.</i>

106
00:13:07.728 --> 00:13:09.313
<i>That's my dream.</i>

107
00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:13.075
<i>It's my nightmare.</i>

108
00:13:15.803 --> 00:13:17.680
<i>Crawling, slithering...</i>

109
00:13:18.873 --> 00:13:20.500
<i>along the edge...</i>

110
00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:25.338
<i>of a straight... razor,</i>

111
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.191
<i>and surviving.</i>

112
00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:36.399
<i>Transmission 11, received '68,
December 30, 0500 hours.</i>

113
00:13:36.682 --> 00:13:38.459
<i>Sector: King, Zulu, King.</i>

114
00:13:40.311 --> 00:13:42.347
<i>But we must kill them.</i>

115
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.782
<i>We must incinerate them,</i>

116
00:13:45.066 --> 00:13:46.567
<i>pig after pig,</i>

117
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.920
<i>cow after cow,</i>

118
00:13:51.656 --> 00:13:53.499
<i>village after village,</i>

119
00:13:53.783 --> 00:13:55.368
<i>Army after army.</i>

120
00:13:56.444 --> 00:13:58.863
<i>And they call me an assassin.</i>

121
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:03.860
<i>What do you call it when
the assassins accuse the assassin?</i>

122
00:14:04.694 --> 00:14:05.695
<i>They lie.</i>

123
00:14:06.446 --> 00:14:08.848
<i>They lie, and we have to be merciful</i>

124
00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:10.950
<i>for those who lie.</i>

125
00:14:11.968 --> 00:14:13.169
<i>Those...</i>

126
00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:15.379
<i>Nabobs,</i>

127
00:14:17.073 --> 00:14:18.741
<i>I hate them.</i>

128
00:14:19.867 --> 00:14:21.577
<i>I do hate them.</i>

129
00:14:27.124 --> 00:14:29.644
Walt Kurtz was one of 
the most outstanding Officers

130
00:14:30.127 --> 00:14:32.030
this country's ever produced.

131
00:14:32.713 --> 00:14:35.083
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding, in every way.

132
00:14:36.617 --> 00:14:38.861
And he was a good man, too.

133
00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:41.463
A humanitarian man.

134
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.592
A man of wit and humor.

135
00:14:45.776 --> 00:14:47.637
He joined the Special Forces.

136
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.674
And after that, his, uh...

137
00:14:53.676 --> 00:14:56.512
ideas, methods...

138
00:14:59.015 --> 00:15:00.308
became...

139
00:15:02.927 --> 00:15:04.345
unsound.

140
00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:11.093
Unsound...

141
00:15:16.632 --> 00:15:21.120
Now he's crossed into Cambodia
with this... Montagnard Army of his

142
00:15:21.203 --> 00:15:24.957
that worship... the man... like a God.

143
00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.928
And follow every order,
however ridiculous.

144
00:15:30.713 --> 00:15:34.925
Well, I have some other... 
shocking news to tell you.

145
00:15:35.384 --> 00:15:37.720
Colonel Kurtz was about to be...

146
00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.398
arrested for murder.

147
00:15:41.207 --> 00:15:44.152
I don't follow, sir. Murdered who?

148
00:15:44.335 --> 00:15:48.406
Kurtz had ordered the execution
of some Vietnamese Intelligence Agents.

149
00:15:48.689 --> 00:15:51.108
Men he believed were, uh, double agents.

150
00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.437
So, he took matters into his own hands.

151
00:15:57.548 --> 00:15:59.350
Well, you see, Willard...

152
00:16:00.518 --> 00:16:02.520
in this war, things get..

153
00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:05.798
confused out there.

154
00:16:06.916 --> 00:16:10.261
Power, ideals, the old morality, and...

155
00:16:10.444 --> 00:16:13.072
practical military necessity.

156
00:16:15.316 --> 00:16:17.735
But out there with these natives,

157
00:16:18.903 --> 00:16:21.864
it must be a... temptation to...

158
00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:24.767
be God.

159
00:16:28.462 --> 00:16:31.674
Because there's a... 
conflict in every human heart...

160
00:16:32.842 --> 00:16:35.336
between the rational and the irrational,

161
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.247
between good and evil.

162
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:42.084
And good does <i>not</i> always triumph.

163
00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:46.247
Sometimes...

164
00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.383
the dark side...

165
00:16:50.151 --> 00:16:54.530
overcomes what Lincoln called,
<i>"the better angels of our nature."</i>

166
00:16:56.507 --> 00:16:59.135
Every man has got a breaking point.

167
00:16:59.802 --> 00:17:01.595
You and I have them.

168
00:17:03.364 --> 00:17:05.491
Walt Kurtz has reached his.

169
00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:09.946
And very obviously, he has gone insane.

170
00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:27.329
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

171
00:17:31.734 --> 00:17:35.321
Your mission is to proceed
up the Nung river in a Navy patrol boat,

172
00:17:37.323 --> 00:17:40.159
pick up Colonel
Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba,

173
00:17:40.718 --> 00:17:43.179
follow it, and learn 
what you can along the way.

174
00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:47.157
When you find the.... 
Colonel, infiltrate his team by...

175
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.785
Whatever means available...

176
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.029
and terminate the Colonel's command.

177
00:17:58.402 --> 00:18:01.038
"Terminate..." the Colonel?

178
00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:06.127
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint,

179
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:12.091
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable... human conduct.

180
00:18:12.574 --> 00:18:15.661
And he is still in the field,
commanding troops.

181
00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:20.141
Terminate... with extreme prejudice.

182
00:18:22.051 --> 00:18:25.529
You understand, Captain,
that this mission does not exist,

183
00:18:27.264 --> 00:18:29.183
nor will it ever exist.

184
00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:26.957
<i>How many people 
had I already killed?</i>

185
00:19:28.192 --> 00:19:30.961
<i>There were those six
that I knew about for sure.</i>

186
00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:35.149
<i>Close enough to blow
their last breath in my face.</i>

187
00:19:37.585 --> 00:19:42.506
<i>But this time, it was
an American, and an Officer.</i>

188
00:19:54.101 --> 00:19:58.439
<i>That wasn't supposed to make
any difference to me, but it did.</i>

189
00:20:01.025 --> 00:20:04.528
<i>Shit, charging a man
with murder in this place</i>

190
00:20:04.612 --> 00:20:07.957
<i>was like handing out
speeding tickets at the Indy 500.</i>

191
00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:14.513
<i>I took the mission.
What the hell else was I gonna do?</i>

192
00:20:16.232 --> 00:20:19.860
<i>But I really didn't know
what I'd do when I found him.</i>

193
00:20:26.826 --> 00:20:28.411
Did you check the tank?

194
00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:31.155
Yeah.

195
00:20:32.906 --> 00:20:36.293
<i>I was being ferried
down the coast in a Navy PBR.</i>

196
00:20:36.477 --> 00:20:40.681
<i>A type of plastic patrol boat,
a pretty common sight on the rivers.</i>

197
00:20:41.165 --> 00:20:43.542
<i>They said it was a good way
to pick up information and move</i>

198
00:20:43.625 --> 00:20:45.728
<i>without drawing a lot of attention.</i>

199
00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:47.747
<i>And that was okay.</i>

200
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.199
<i>I needed the air and the time.</i>

201
00:20:51.492 --> 00:20:53.252
<i>Only problem was, I wouldn't be alone.</i>

202
00:20:53.435 --> 00:20:55.271
Morning, Cap'n.

203
00:20:57.848 --> 00:21:00.601
<i>The crew were mostly just kids.</i>

204
00:21:01.185 --> 00:21:03.971
<i>Rock 'n' Rollers
with one foot in their graves.</i>

205
00:21:05.114 --> 00:21:07.449
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

206
00:21:09.193 --> 00:21:10.862
<i>The machinist,
the one they called Chef,</i>

207
00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:12.046
<i>was from New Orleans.</i>

208
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:14.907
<i>He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.</i>

209
00:21:15.391 --> 00:21:17.551
<i>Probably wrapped
too tight for New Orleans.</i>

210
00:21:18.352 --> 00:21:20.646
<i>Lance, on the forward .50s,
was a famous surfer</i>

211
00:21:20.729 --> 00:21:22.623
<i>from the beaches south of LA.</i>

212
00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:26.869
<i>To look at him, you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.</i>

213
00:21:28.862 --> 00:21:33.100
<i>"Clean, Mr. Clean,"
was from some South Bronx shithole,</i>

214
00:21:33.183 --> 00:21:35.269
<i>and I think the light and space of Vietnam</i>

215
00:21:35.352 --> 00:21:37.305
<i>really put the zap on his head.</i>

216
00:21:40.624 --> 00:21:42.702
<i>Then there was Phillips, the Chief.</i>

217
00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:46.764
<i>It might have been my mission,
but it sure as shit was the Chief's boat.</i>

218
00:21:47.047 --> 00:21:49.199
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water

219
00:21:49.383 --> 00:21:51.477
to get into the Nung river.

220
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.263
They're both hot, belong to Charlie.

221
00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:57.333
Don't worry about it.

222
00:21:58.467 --> 00:21:59.868
I don't smoke.

223
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.440
You know, I've pulled 
a few Special Ops in here.

224
00:22:05.024 --> 00:22:06.742
About six months ago,

225
00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:10.963
I took a man who was goin' up
past the bridge at Do Luong.

226
00:22:12.114 --> 00:22:14.074
He was "regular Army," too.

227
00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:18.504
I heard he shot himself in the head.

228
00:22:28.088 --> 00:22:31.341
<i>At first, I thought
they handed me the wrong dossier.</i>

229
00:22:32.025 --> 00:22:34.636
<i>I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead.</i>

230
00:22:36.346 --> 00:22:39.224
<i>Third-Generation West Point,
top of his class,</i>

231
00:22:39.408 --> 00:22:44.997
<i>Korea, Airborne, about 1,000 decorations,
et cetera, et cetera...</i>

232
00:22:48.317 --> 00:22:52.529
<i>I had heard his voice on the tape
and it really put the hook in me,</i>

233
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.950
<i>but I couldn't connect up
that voice with this man.</i>

234
00:23:03.999 --> 00:23:06.919
<i>Like they said,
he had an impressive career.</i>

235
00:23:07.836 --> 00:23:09.671
<i>Maybe too impressive.</i>

236
00:23:10.814 --> 00:23:12.357
<i>I mean, perfect.</i>

237
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.879
<i>He was being groomed for one
of the top slots in the Corporation,</i>

238
00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:20.099
<i>General, Chief of Staff, anything.</i>

239
00:23:22.351 --> 00:23:26.338
<i>In 1964, he returned from a tour
with Advisory Command in Vietnam</i>

240
00:23:26.422 --> 00:23:28.457
<i>and things started to slip.</i>

241
00:23:28.941 --> 00:23:33.195
<i>His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and Lyndon Johnson, was restricted.</i>

242
00:23:35.489 --> 00:23:37.366
<i>Seems they didn't dig
what he had to tell 'em.</i>

243
00:23:39.118 --> 00:23:42.121
<i>During the next few months,
he made three requests for transfer</i>

244
00:23:42.204 --> 00:23:47.417
<i>to Airborne Training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted.</i>

245
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.430
<i>Airborne?</i>

246
00:23:54.383 --> 00:23:56.135
<i>He was 38 years old...</i>

247
00:23:58.095 --> 00:24:00.105
<i>Why the fuck would he do that?</i>

248
00:24:02.699 --> 00:24:05.994
<i>1966, joins Special Forces,</i>

249
00:24:06.979 --> 00:24:08.397
<i>returns, Vietnam.</i>

250
00:24:10.107 --> 00:24:11.951
- Hey, what's that?
- Arc light.

251
00:24:12.434 --> 00:24:15.354
- What's that?
- B-52 strike.

252
00:24:17.156 --> 00:24:18.490
- What's that?
- Arc light.

253
00:24:18.574 --> 00:24:21.460
I hate that. Every time
I hear that, something terrible happens.

254
00:24:21.743 --> 00:24:23.545
Charlie don't never see 'em
or hear 'em, man.

255
00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:24.630
There they are!

256
00:24:24.913 --> 00:24:27.341
Concussion will suck
the air outta your damn lungs.

257
00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:30.970
- Somethin' terrible's gonna happen.
- Smoke!

258
00:24:31.253 --> 00:24:32.705
Secondary burning!

259
00:24:33.288 --> 00:24:35.165
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

260
00:24:35.348 --> 00:24:36.348
Let's have a look, Chief.

261
00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:42.664
<i>It was the Air-Cav,
First of the Ninth.</i>

262
00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:43.774
That's them.

263
00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:46.318
<i>Our escorts to the 
mouth of the Nung river.</i>

264
00:24:46.602 --> 00:24:50.322
<i>But they were supposed to be
waiting for us another 30 km, ahead.</i>

265
00:24:50.606 --> 00:24:55.068
<i>Well, Airmobile,
those boys just couldn't stay put.</i>

266
00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:10.867
Kid, come on. Get down. Come on.

267
00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:24.231
<i>First of the Ninth
was an old Cavalry Division</i>

268
00:25:24.514 --> 00:25:28.160
<i>that had cashed in its horses for
choppers and gone tear-assing around Nam</i>

269
00:25:28.243 --> 00:25:30.078
<i>looking for the shit.</i>

270
00:25:30.579 --> 00:25:34.016
<i>They'd given Charlie a few
surprises in their time, here.</i>

271
00:25:35.234 --> 00:25:38.562
<i>What they were mopping up now,
hadn't even happened yet, an hour ago.</i>

272
00:25:40.522 --> 00:25:42.282
Just keep running by!
Run for television!

273
00:25:42.332 --> 00:25:44.752
Don't look at the camera!
Just keep... go on! Keep going!

274
00:25:45.035 --> 00:25:46.479
This is for television!
Don't look at the camera!

275
00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:47.588
Don't look at the camera!

276
00:25:47.671 --> 00:25:50.174
Just go by like you're fighting!
Like you're fighting!

277
00:25:50.257 --> 00:25:52.836
Don't look at the camera!
It's for television! Just go through!

278
00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.562
Go through! Just go by! 
Keep on going! Like you're fighting!

279
00:25:55.945 --> 00:25:58.724
Keep going! Don't look at the camera!
Go on! Keep going!

280
00:26:21.121 --> 00:26:23.082
Where can I find the CO?

281
00:26:23.165 --> 00:26:24.583
That's the Colonel coming down!

282
00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:37.705
The CO's on that chopper.

283
00:27:01.069 --> 00:27:04.373
Lieutenant, bomb that 
tree line back about 100 yards!

284
00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:07.000
- Give me some room to breathe!
- Yes, sir!

285
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.675
- Body cards!
- Sir?

286
00:27:15.058 --> 00:27:16.885
- Bring my body cards!
- Yes, sir!

287
00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:23.517
I'm the Fourth Tank Commander.
I got five tanks broken down.

288
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.462
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

289
00:27:27.162 --> 00:27:28.005
Captain Willard!

290
00:27:28.188 --> 00:27:31.984
I carry priority papers from
COMSEC Intelligence, II Corps.

291
00:27:32.267 --> 00:27:35.737
I understand Nha Trang has briefed
you on the requirements of my mission.

292
00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:38.390
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang!

293
00:27:38.674 --> 00:27:41.226
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

294
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.328
- We'll see what we can do, but, uh...
- Colonel.

295
00:27:43.412 --> 00:27:45.472
Just stay out of my way
until this is done, Captain!

296
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.006
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

297
00:27:54.189 --> 00:27:58.235
A two of spades, three of spades,
four of diamonds,

298
00:27:59.419 --> 00:28:02.130
six of clubs, eight of spades.

299
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:06.560
There isn't one worth a Jack
in the whole bunch. Four of diamonds.

300
00:28:08.428 --> 00:28:12.357
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death Cards!

301
00:28:12.641 --> 00:28:15.194
- What?
- Death Cards!

302
00:28:15.477 --> 00:28:17.946
- Death?
- It lets Charlie know who did this.

303
00:28:21.983 --> 00:28:24.203
- Cheer up, son.
- <i>We will not hurt or harm you.</i>

304
00:28:24.486 --> 00:28:27.114
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

305
00:28:29.391 --> 00:28:32.044
<i>This is an area that is controlled</i>

306
00:28:32.127 --> 00:28:35.339
<i>by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.</i>

307
00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:42.221
<i>We are here to help you.</i>

308
00:28:45.715 --> 00:28:48.493
<i>We are here
to extend a welcome hand</i>

309
00:28:48.577 --> 00:28:50.979
- <i>to those of you who would like...</i>
- Come on. Everybody in?

310
00:28:51.063 --> 00:28:54.233
<i>To return to the arms of
the South Vietnamese Government.</i>

311
00:28:56.626 --> 00:28:57.778
Hurry up!

312
00:29:00.546 --> 00:29:01.165
Move it out!

313
00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:07.071
<i>This is an area that is controlled
by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.</i>

314
00:29:07.755 --> 00:29:09.298
Hey! What's this?

315
00:29:10.966 --> 00:29:12.300
What is this?

316
00:29:12.634 --> 00:29:14.987
Uh, this man's hurt pretty bad, sir.

317
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.422
About the only thing
that's holding his guts in, sir,

318
00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:19.132
- is that pot lid.
- Yeah?

319
00:29:19.316 --> 00:29:20.817
What does he have to say?

320
00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:23.553
These are dirty. Dirty VC.

321
00:29:23.837 --> 00:29:27.132
He wants water. 
He can drink paddy water.

322
00:29:28.241 --> 00:29:30.644
Get out of here! Gimme that!
Gimme that canteen...

323
00:29:30.727 --> 00:29:33.689
- He's VC! He tried to-
- Any man... that's brave enough to figh-

324
00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:36.775
Get out of here!
I'll kick your fuckin' ass!

325
00:29:36.858 --> 00:29:38.110
He killed a lot of our people!

326
00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:41.029
Any man brave enough to fight
with his guts strapped on him,

327
00:29:41.113 --> 00:29:42.948
can drink from my canteen, any day!

328
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:46.827
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those
Sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

329
00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.705
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.

330
00:29:51.206 --> 00:29:52.624
Yeah? Here.

331
00:29:53.408 --> 00:29:56.161
Repeat, we have a body count. We have...

332
00:29:59.331 --> 00:30:00.766
What's your name, Sailor?

333
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:02.968
Gunner's Mate Third Class, L. Johnson, sir!

334
00:30:03.151 --> 00:30:06.388
- Gunner's Mate Third Class—
- Alright. Lance Johnson, the surfer?

335
00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:07.823
Yes, sir.

336
00:30:08.307 --> 00:30:12.227
Well, it's an honor to meet you, Lance.
I've admired your nose-riding for years!

337
00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:15.272
I like your cutback, too. I think
you have the best cutback there is.

338
00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:18.066
- Hey, thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap, Lance.

339
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.152
I'm Bill Kilgore. I'm a goofy foot.

340
00:30:20.335 --> 00:30:22.204
- This guy with ya?
- Yeah.

341
00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:25.674
I want you to meet some guys.
This is Mike from San Diego.

342
00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:27.184
- Far out.
- Johnny from Malibu.

343
00:30:27.567 --> 00:30:29.494
- John, hi. Far out.
- Pretty solid surfers.

344
00:30:29.778 --> 00:30:31.431
None of us are anywhere
near your class, though.

345
00:30:31.655 --> 00:30:32.773
No way.

346
00:30:33.156 --> 00:30:36.793
We do- we do a lot of surfing around here, Lance.
I like to finish operations early,

347
00:30:36.977 --> 00:30:39.821
fly down to Vung Tau
for the evening glass.

348
00:30:40.922 --> 00:30:42.025
Been riding since you got here?

349
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:44.134
No way!
I haven't surfed since I've been here!

350
00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:48.889
Through Christ our Lord,
from whom all good things come.

351
00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:51.808
Through Him,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

352
00:30:51.892 --> 00:30:55.562
all glory and honor is yours,
almighty Father. Amen.

353
00:30:55.945 --> 00:30:59.708
Let us pray with confidence to the Father,
in the words our Savior gave us.

354
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:04.363
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

355
00:31:04.546 --> 00:31:07.032
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

356
00:31:07.515 --> 00:31:09.201
on earth as it is in heaven.

357
00:31:09.384 --> 00:31:11.344
Give us this day our daily bread—

358
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:16.208
<i>As we forgive those
who trespass against us;</i>

359
00:31:16.391 --> 00:31:19.853
<i>lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.</i>

360
00:31:29.963 --> 00:31:32.691
<i>Kilgore'd had
a pretty good day for himself.</i>

361
00:31:33.174 --> 00:31:35.227
<i>They choppered in the t-bones and the beer,</i>

362
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.729
<i>and turned the LZ into a beach party.</i>

363
00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:41.650
<i>The more they tried to
make it just like home,</i>

364
00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:44.244
<i>the more they made everybody miss it.</i>

365
00:31:44.528 --> 00:31:47.739
Make my meat rare, rare but not cold!

366
00:31:53.737 --> 00:31:56.573
<i>Well, he wasn't a bad Officer, I guess.</i>

367
00:31:57.632 --> 00:32:00.819
<i>He loved his boys
and you felt safe with him.</i>

368
00:32:01.302 --> 00:32:04.381
<i>He was one of those guys that
had that weird light around him.</i>

369
00:32:04.864 --> 00:32:07.801
<i>You just knew he wasn't gonna
get so much as a scratch, here.</i>

370
00:32:08.084 --> 00:32:09.719
What happened to your mission, Captain?

371
00:32:10.003 --> 00:32:11.683
Nha Trang forget all about you?

372
00:32:20.396 --> 00:32:21.524
Airborne.

373
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:26.670
Sir, two places we can 
get into the river...

374
00:32:26.853 --> 00:32:29.381
- Yeah.
- Here and here.

375
00:32:29.664 --> 00:32:33.260
It's a pretty wide delta, but these
are the only two spots I'm really sure of.

376
00:32:34.894 --> 00:32:37.514
Well, that village you're
pointing at is kind of hairy, Willard.

377
00:32:38.114 --> 00:32:40.067
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy...

378
00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.002
Got some pretty heavy ordnance.

379
00:32:42.285 --> 00:32:45.213
I lost a few recon ships
in there, now and again.

380
00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:47.716
What's the name of that Goddamn village?
Vin Drin...

381
00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:49.676
- Dop.
- "Dop" or "Lop?"

382
00:32:50.727 --> 00:32:52.988
Damn gook names all sound the same.

383
00:32:54.756 --> 00:32:57.793
Mike, you know anything
about this point at Vin Drin Dop?

384
00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.578
That's a fantastic peak!

385
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.189
- Peak?
- About six foot.

386
00:33:02.472 --> 00:33:05.684
Yeah, it's an outstanding peak. 
It's got both the long right and left slide

387
00:33:05.767 --> 00:33:09.104
with a- with a bowl section!
It's unbelievable. It's just tube city.

388
00:33:13.833 --> 00:33:15.860
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?
"A good peak."

389
00:33:15.944 --> 00:33:18.088
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

390
00:33:18.771 --> 00:33:21.449
- It's all Goddamn beach break.
- It's really hairy in there, sir.

391
00:33:21.533 --> 00:33:24.452
That's where we lost McDonald.
They shot the hell out of us, there.

392
00:33:24.911 --> 00:33:26.588
That's Charlie's point.

393
00:33:28.164 --> 00:33:30.309
Sir, we can go in there tomorrow, at dawn.

394
00:33:30.892 --> 00:33:32.844
There's always a good
offshore breeze in the morning.

395
00:33:33.528 --> 00:33:34.888
We may not be
able to get the boat in.

396
00:33:35.071 --> 00:33:37.407
The draft at the mouth of
that river may be too shallow.

397
00:33:38.967 --> 00:33:41.646
Yeah, we'll pick your boat up and put it
down like a baby, right where you want it.

398
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:45.190
This is the First of the Ninth Air-Cav, son.
Airmobile!

399
00:33:46.658 --> 00:33:48.519
I can take that point
and hold it just as long as I like,

400
00:33:48.643 --> 00:33:51.613
and you can get any place up that
river that suits you, young Captain.

401
00:33:52.272 --> 00:33:53.648
Hell, a six-foot peak...

402
00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:57.949
All right, take a gunship 
back to the division.

403
00:33:58.127 --> 00:34:00.172
Lance, go with Mike
and let him pick out a board for ya,

404
00:34:00.196 --> 00:34:02.148
and bring me my Yater Spoon,
the eight-six.

405
00:34:02.231 --> 00:34:04.301
- I don't know, sir, it's, uh—
- What is it, Soldier?

406
00:34:04.884 --> 00:34:07.254
Well, I mean, it's pretty hairy in there.
It's- it's Charlie's point!

407
00:34:07.637 --> 00:34:09.506
Charlie don't surf!

408
00:34:33.313 --> 00:34:36.775
Hey, Jesus, Clean,
you ain't gonna believe this. Look.

409
00:34:37.984 --> 00:34:40.779
Hey, man!
They're pickin' up the boat!

410
00:34:43.965 --> 00:34:47.802
- How are you feelin', Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

411
00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:51.740
All right, son, let her rip.

412
00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:53.424
Let's go!

413
00:36:16.749 --> 00:36:18.960
I never have
gotten used to a light board,

414
00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.405
and I can't get used to one.
I'm used to a heavy board.

415
00:36:21.529 --> 00:36:23.156
I know, it's a real drag.

416
00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:26.601
- Do you prefer a heavy or a light board?
- Heavier.

417
00:36:26.985 --> 00:36:27.994
- Really?
- Yeah!

418
00:36:28.377 --> 00:36:30.221
I thought all the young
guys like lighter boards.

419
00:36:30.705 --> 00:36:32.315
You can't- can't ride
the nose on those things—

420
00:36:32.399 --> 00:36:33.971
<i>Big Duke Six, this is, uh...</i>

421
00:36:33.995 --> 00:36:36.135
Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.

422
00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:37.517
<i>Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,</i>

423
00:36:37.541 --> 00:36:39.297
put on heading 2-7-0.

424
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.032
Assume attack formation.

425
00:36:41.316 --> 00:36:43.702
<i>That's a Roger, Big Duke.
Okay, we're going in.</i>

426
00:36:43.785 --> 00:36:45.032
- Lance.
- Huh?

427
00:36:45.356 --> 00:36:47.706
We'll come in low out of the rising sun,

428
00:36:47.989 --> 00:36:50.208
and about a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

429
00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:52.852
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.

430
00:36:53.036 --> 00:36:56.414
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it!

431
00:36:57.165 --> 00:36:59.125
Hey, they're gonna play music!

432
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.676
How come all you guys sit on your helmet?

433
00:37:09.786 --> 00:37:12.330
So we don't get our balls blown off!

434
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:28.538
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust:
put on 'Psy War Op', make it loud.

435
00:37:28.821 --> 00:37:32.183
This is a Romeo Foxtrot. Shall we dance?

436
00:37:37.055 --> 00:37:38.807
- Jimmy!
- Yes, sir!

437
00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:18.917
Run, Charlie!

438
00:40:38.728 --> 00:40:40.998
<i>We got some...
We got some more goin' down there...</i>

439
00:40:41.022 --> 00:40:43.691
<i>Look out, automatic .50-Cal!
.50-Cal in the open!</i>

440
00:40:44.392 --> 00:40:46.304
<i>I've spotted a large weapon down below.</i>

441
00:40:46.728 --> 00:40:47.863
We're gonna go down and check it out.

442
00:40:48.087 --> 00:40:50.298
<i>All right, this is Fox Five.
We're going in...</i>

443
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.337
- <i>All right. What a shot.</i>
- Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.

444
00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:05.913
Get you a case of beer for that.

445
00:41:27.527 --> 00:41:30.029
<i>6-4-1-0,
we're over the, uh, village right now.</i>

446
00:41:30.313 --> 00:41:31.990
I think I see a vehicle,
down in the courtyard.

447
00:41:32.073 --> 00:41:35.368
- <i>I'm gonna check it out.</i>
- Well done, Hawks. Well done.

448
00:41:35.651 --> 00:41:38.746
I want some 20 Mike-Mike Vulcan,
right along those tree lines.

449
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.281
Ripple the shit out of 'em.

450
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.001
I got a vehicle on the bridge,
.50 caliber on-board.

451
00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:45.553
He's moving across to resupply the weapon.

452
00:41:46.612 --> 00:41:49.707
<i>Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down, myself.</i>

453
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.025
Don't these people ever give up?

454
00:41:55.504 --> 00:41:57.223
Nice shot, Bill!

455
00:41:58.433 --> 00:42:00.184
- Shit!
- All right, all right!

456
00:42:01.268 --> 00:42:05.523
- It's just a flare!
- It's a flare! Gotta get out of here!

457
00:42:05.606 --> 00:42:07.567
Un-ass that shit. Get it out of here!

458
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:11.446
Get it out. Get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right. It's just a flare.

459
00:42:12.113 --> 00:42:14.782
- Everybody all right? Lance, you all right?
- I'm fine!

460
00:42:29.997 --> 00:42:30.990
Get down!

461
00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:55.865
I'm not goin'!
I'm not goin'! I'm not goin'!

462
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:12.524
<i>Yeah, we just got a Secondaries,
down there in the Plaza.</i>

463
00:43:12.548 --> 00:43:15.426
<i>Blue Three, Blue Four,
hold out over position—</i>

464
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:18.679
<i>Duke Six, Duke Six, uh,
we've got wounded down there.</i>

465
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:26.354
My God! Oh, my God!

466
00:43:27.855 --> 00:43:30.691
- Get a stretcher over here!
- You're all right.

467
00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:32.652
Please! Help me!

468
00:43:35.563 --> 00:43:38.399
- Please, God! Help me!
- Stay with me, son, you're gonna be okay.

469
00:43:39.592 --> 00:43:41.303
- Let's give him some morphine.
- My God! My God!

470
00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:45.581
- 0-3-7-7-4-2.
- Where's that duster?!

471
00:43:45.685 --> 00:43:48.479
I want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 15 minutes.

472
00:43:48.743 --> 00:43:50.378
I want my men out.

473
00:43:50.475 --> 00:43:52.245
<i>Somebody stay in
there tight with Big Duke.</i>

474
00:43:52.555 --> 00:43:56.517
<i>This is Ten-Two. Uh, we're gonna
be in, throw 'em on and get out—</i>

475
00:44:18.514 --> 00:44:20.883
She's got a grenade! She's got a grenade!

476
00:44:23.652 --> 00:44:25.663
<i>Jesus! The whole Goddamn thing just—</i>

477
00:44:25.765 --> 00:44:27.684
- <i>She blew the shit out of—</i>
- Fucking savages...

478
00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:30.869
<i>Can I get a MedEvac?</i>

479
00:44:30.952 --> 00:44:32.696
- What's goin' on over there?
- <i>Holy Christ, she's a SAP.</i>

480
00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.357
<i>I'm gonna get that dink bitch.
Get over there, Johnny. Go in there.</i>

481
00:44:35.481 --> 00:44:37.125
<i>Put that right skid right up her ass.</i>

482
00:44:40.278 --> 00:44:43.240
We gotta get some air in these trees.
It's Goddamn eat-up with enemy down there.

483
00:44:43.264 --> 00:44:45.558
I'm takin' fire.
I'm takin' hits all over—

484
00:44:45.741 --> 00:44:49.228
Three o'clock! Three o'clock, my position!
Drawin' fire, drawin' heavy fire!

485
00:44:49.512 --> 00:44:52.640
I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! I'm going in.
My tail rotor's out. I got control.

486
00:45:01.882 --> 00:45:04.368
- What do you think?
- Wow, this is really exciting, man!

487
00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:07.705
- No, no! The waves! The waves!
- Oh, right.

488
00:45:07.988 --> 00:45:10.808
Look at that, breaks both ways.
Watch. Watch.

489
00:45:11.959 --> 00:45:14.170
Look! Good six-foot swells!

490
00:45:38.786 --> 00:45:39.529
Come here, Lance.

491
00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:44.075
Incoming!

492
00:45:48.737 --> 00:45:51.807
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir!
Maybe you ought to surf somewhere else!

493
00:45:51.891 --> 00:45:55.695
What do you know about surfing, Major?!
You're from Goddamn New Jersey.

494
00:45:58.372 --> 00:45:59.757
Come here! Come here!

495
00:46:02.751 --> 00:46:04.996
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?

496
00:46:05.279 --> 00:46:08.057
I wanna see how rideable that stuff is.
Go change.

497
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.767
It's still pretty hairy out there, sir.

498
00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:12.103
- Do you wanna surf, Soldier?
- Yes, sir.

499
00:46:12.186 --> 00:46:17.149
That's good, son, 'cause you either
surf or fight. That clear? Now, get goin'.

500
00:46:17.433 --> 00:46:20.261
I'll cover for 'em.
And bring a board for Lance!

501
00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:23.873
We can't do shit till the boat gets here.

502
00:46:24.356 --> 00:46:25.471
Lance...

503
00:46:25.995 --> 00:46:27.760
I'll bet you can't wait to get out there.

504
00:46:27.843 --> 00:46:29.787
- What?
- See how they break both ways?

505
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:33.749
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think of that?

506
00:46:34.033 --> 00:46:35.960
Bill, I think we ought to wait
for the tide to come up!

507
00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:38.838
- Hey, hey, Lance, come here. Look. Look!
- Incoming!

508
00:46:41.707 --> 00:46:44.335
The tide doesn't come in for six hours!

509
00:46:46.312 --> 00:46:48.472
You wanna wait here for six hours?!

510
00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:54.136
Yo! Hey! Chief!

511
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:04.947
<i>Okay, fellas,
quit hiding. Come on!</i>

512
00:47:05.231 --> 00:47:08.159
- <i>Let's go, dickheads, take off!</i>
- Aw, come on! God damn it!

513
00:47:08.442 --> 00:47:10.828
Don't you think
it's a little risky for R&R?!

514
00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:15.499
If I say it's safe to surf this beach,
Captain, it's safe to surf this beach!

515
00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:19.920
I mean, I'm not afraid to surf this place!
I'll surf this fucking place!

516
00:47:22.423 --> 00:47:24.425
Give me that R-T, Soldier.

517
00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:28.346
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.

518
00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:29.349
Goddamnit!

519
00:47:29.373 --> 00:47:31.373
<i>I want that tree line bombed!</i>

520
00:47:31.432 --> 00:47:34.226
<i>Big Duke Six, Roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by.</i>

521
00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.062
<i>Blow 'em into the Stone Age, son!</i>

522
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:37.085
ASAP, out!

523
00:47:37.245 --> 00:47:38.347
No, ma'am, no!

524
00:47:39.732 --> 00:47:41.932
All right, now. Let me take care of this.
You all right?

525
00:47:42.184 --> 00:47:43.110
Get that out of here!

526
00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:46.364
- I'm sorry.
- Come here, now. All right.

527
00:47:46.447 --> 00:47:48.866
- No, ma'am. Sorry! You can't go!
- Jimmy!

528
00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:50.951
<i>Hawk One-Two,
Dove One-Three, Roger.</i>

529
00:47:51.035 --> 00:47:52.596
<i>They need some napalm,
down there in the tree line.</i>

530
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.538
<i>Can you guys push ground?
I'm tryin' to put it down, here.</i>

531
00:47:54.622 --> 00:47:57.517
<i>Right, One-Three. We're fixed
to fuck with 'em. What's the target?</i>

532
00:47:57.541 --> 00:48:00.753
<i>We're tryin' to suppress some
mortar fire off the tree line, down there.</i>

533
00:48:00.936 --> 00:48:02.146
<i>Roger. Here we come.</i>

534
00:48:02.229 --> 00:48:04.450
<i>Good, give it all you got.
Bring in all your ships.</i>

535
00:48:04.974 --> 00:48:05.809
<i>Wing abreast.</i>

536
00:48:06.333 --> 00:48:08.977
MedEvac him in my chopper!
Get him back to the hospital!

537
00:48:09.678 --> 00:48:13.099
No, no, no, you gotta go with him!
Come on! Go! Go!

538
00:48:14.082 --> 00:48:16.911
Get it out of here!
And tell my guys I want my board!

539
00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:18.497
<i>Brig Duke Six,
this is Dove One-Three.</i>

540
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:21.273
<i>The jets are inbound, now.
You got about 30 seconds to on-station.</i>

541
00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:24.110
<i>Get your people back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one.</i>

542
00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:31.575
Don't worry. We'll have this place
cleaned up and ready in a jiffy, son.

543
00:48:31.659 --> 00:48:33.285
Don't you worry.

544
00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:34.995
Give me those shorts.

545
00:48:37.323 --> 00:48:40.451
These are from the Air-Cav,
a present from me and the boys.

546
00:48:41.035 --> 00:48:44.396
I want to see you do your
stuff in 'em, out there. Okay?

547
00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.920
You see that?!

548
00:49:07.895 --> 00:49:09.238
You smell that?

549
00:49:10.038 --> 00:49:12.166
- Do you smell that?
- What?

550
00:49:12.658 --> 00:49:14.410
Napalm, son.

551
00:49:14.869 --> 00:49:17.246
Nothing else in the world
smells like that.

552
00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:19.665
<i>Come on.
Move it! Move it! Move it!</i>

553
00:49:21.784 --> 00:49:24.270
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

554
00:49:24.753 --> 00:49:27.439
You know, one time we had
a hill bombed... for 12 hours.

555
00:49:27.523 --> 00:49:29.900
And when it was all over, I walked up...

556
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:34.013
We didn't find one of 'em,
not one stinking dink body.

557
00:49:36.474 --> 00:49:39.310
But the smell, you know,
that gasoline smell...

558
00:49:39.393 --> 00:49:41.061
The whole hill...

559
00:49:42.229 --> 00:49:43.898
it smelled like...

560
00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:47.860
victory.

561
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.167
Someday, this war's gonna end.

562
00:50:10.216 --> 00:50:12.410
- Lance, the wind!
- Huh?

563
00:50:12.493 --> 00:50:13.828
- The wind!
- What?

564
00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:17.848
It's blowin' on shore! It's comin' on shore. 
It's gonna blow this place out!

565
00:50:17.932 --> 00:50:21.060
- It's gonna ruin it!
- Not cool! It's gonna blow out!

566
00:50:21.143 --> 00:50:23.479
It's the Goddamn napalm!
That's what's doin' it!

567
00:50:23.562 --> 00:50:26.982
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel,
but I'm afraid that does it.

568
00:50:27.066 --> 00:50:30.736
Okay, the kid's got a reputation. 
You can't expect him to surf <i>those</i> sloppy waves.

569
00:50:30.919 --> 00:50:33.405
- I understand what you're saying.
- Yeah, I'm an artist, Bill.

570
00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:36.475
- I couldn't surf that stuff.
- Lance, look...

571
00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:38.436
I apologize! It's not my fault!

572
00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:40.347
The waves are gettin'
blown out by the napalm!

573
00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:41.431
Hey, Bill, don't get me wrong—

574
00:50:41.455 --> 00:50:43.457
It was the bombs causin'
a vortex with the wind!

575
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:44.917
I accept your apology.

576
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.545
All right, then. But if you...
could hang around just 20 minutes!

577
00:50:47.628 --> 00:50:49.548
- Maybe some other time, Bill.
- Just 20 minutes! Okay?

578
00:50:50.806 --> 00:50:52.733
- I'm an artist!
- Keep walkin'!

579
00:50:54.426 --> 00:50:57.888
<i>Okay, give it a try, guys!
One goes left and one goes right.</i>

580
00:50:58.472 --> 00:50:59.974
<i>Look, Lance...</i>

581
00:51:00.075 --> 00:51:01.577
- You through surfin'?
- Yeah!

582
00:51:01.742 --> 00:51:03.519
- Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
- No.

583
00:51:03.602 --> 00:51:04.895
- You sure?
- Yeah!

584
00:51:04.979 --> 00:51:06.438
Let's get the fuck out of here!

585
00:51:06.522 --> 00:51:10.484
<i>It's the fuckin' napalm!
Just wait 20 minutes!</i>

586
00:51:11.827 --> 00:51:12.845
Lance! Fuck!

587
00:51:12.928 --> 00:51:14.430
We've been lookin' for you!

588
00:51:18.759 --> 00:51:21.136
- Don't leave without me!
- Where the fuck you goin'?

589
00:51:24.823 --> 00:51:26.074
Incoming!

590
00:51:28.268 --> 00:51:31.480
- The Colonel's surfboard!
- Get the fuck off me! It's mine!

591
00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:36.485
- Guys, help me!
- Get the board and let's get out of here!

592
00:51:40.973 --> 00:51:42.391
Fucking Airborne!

593
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:16.650
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.

594
00:52:16.917 --> 00:52:18.093
Come on, man. Let's get high.

595
00:52:18.177 --> 00:52:20.137
- Want to smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.

596
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.473
<i>"Someday this war's gonna end."</i>

597
00:52:23.766 --> 00:52:26.310
<i>That would be just fine
with the boys on the boat.</i>

598
00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:28.929
<i>They weren't looking
for anything more than a way home.</i>

599
00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:30.330
Captain?

600
00:52:30.731 --> 00:52:33.359
<i>Trouble is, I'd been back there...</i>

601
00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:37.087
<i>and I knew that it
just didn't exist anymore.</i>

602
00:52:40.841 --> 00:52:42.593
Buddha time. Here.

603
00:52:43.369 --> 00:52:46.747
All right, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

604
00:52:51.852 --> 00:52:54.296
<i>If that's how Kilgore fought the war,</i>

605
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.758
<i>I began to wonder what
they really had against Kurtz.</i>

606
00:52:58.467 --> 00:53:00.928
<i>It wasn't just insanity and murder.</i>

607
00:53:01.428 --> 00:53:04.723
<i>There was enough of that
to go around for everyone.</i>

608
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:16.949
I mean,
he never was hurtin' for pussy.

609
00:53:17.127 --> 00:53:18.587
I'm not here.

610
00:53:19.713 --> 00:53:22.841
I'm walking through the jungle
gathering mangoes.

611
00:53:23.859 --> 00:53:25.652
I meet Raquel Welch.

612
00:53:28.155 --> 00:53:30.657
I make a nice mango cream pudding,

613
00:53:33.911 --> 00:53:36.414
Y'know, kind of spread it around on us.

614
00:53:37.097 --> 00:53:43.145
She's into mangoes, too.
She's, like, one limb above me.

615
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:45.681
We're both in the jungle here, nude.

616
00:53:45.764 --> 00:53:47.391
- Hey, Chief!
- Yeah?

617
00:53:47.474 --> 00:53:49.435
Here comes that Colonel guy, again.

618
00:53:51.979 --> 00:53:54.815
<i>You know how hard it is 
to find a board you like?</i>

619
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:57.985
<i>I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

620
00:53:58.268 --> 00:54:00.904
<i>I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

621
00:54:01.088 --> 00:54:03.657
<i>Just give me back the board, Lance.</i>

622
00:54:04.041 --> 00:54:06.718
<i>It was a good board, and I like it.</i>

623
00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:09.621
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.</i>

624
00:54:09.705 --> 00:54:11.725
He's a determined motherfucker!

625
00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:12.875
<i>I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

626
00:54:12.958 --> 00:54:16.712
- Cocksucker!
- <i>I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

627
00:54:16.795 --> 00:54:19.548
<i>Just give me back the board, Lance.</i>

628
00:54:19.731 --> 00:54:22.111
<i>It was a good board, and I like it.</i>

629
00:54:22.718 --> 00:54:25.471
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.</i>

630
00:54:26.847 --> 00:54:28.557
<i>I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

631
00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.269
Jesus Christ.
That guy's too fuckin' much, man.

632
00:54:32.352 --> 00:54:34.272
Do you think he would have shot us?

633
00:54:35.564 --> 00:54:36.750
He wouldn't have shot us on the beach,

634
00:54:36.874 --> 00:54:39.394
but I think he would have shot
us if he saw me takin' his board.

635
00:54:39.418 --> 00:54:42.618
<i>"Let's go surfin', now...
Everybody's learnin' how..."</i>

636
00:54:42.696 --> 00:54:44.323
Let's get this board outta my turret.

637
00:54:45.406 --> 00:54:46.383
Sucker.

638
00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:49.536
Sock it to me, Lance.

639
00:54:55.501 --> 00:54:57.103
I wonder if that's the same chopper.

640
00:54:57.227 --> 00:54:59.967
Oh, hell, he's probably got 'em all
over the river with that recording.

641
00:55:00.672 --> 00:55:02.633
We'll have to hole up here till dark, Chief.

642
00:55:02.716 --> 00:55:05.010
Don't worry, Lance.
He won't follow us too far.

643
00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:07.930
- What makes you say that?
- You think that Big Cav Colonel

644
00:55:08.013 --> 00:55:10.265
wants everyone upriver
to know we stole his board?

645
00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:11.600
I didn't steal it!

646
00:55:14.761 --> 00:55:16.188
- Captain?
- Mm?

647
00:55:16.471 --> 00:55:18.598
Just how far up this river we goin'?

648
00:55:19.691 --> 00:55:21.610
It's classified, Chief. I can't tell you.

649
00:55:24.696 --> 00:55:26.114
We're goin' up pretty far.

650
00:55:28.742 --> 00:55:30.244
Is it gonna be hairy?

651
00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:32.913
I don't know, kid.

652
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:35.874
Yeah, probably.

653
00:55:35.958 --> 00:55:39.086
You like it like that, Captain,
when it's hot, hairy?

654
00:55:39.962 --> 00:55:41.088
Fuck...

655
00:55:51.598 --> 00:55:55.310
Never get a chance to know what the fuck
you are in some factory in Ohio.

656
00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:01.358
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get 
those mangoes now, okay?

657
00:56:01.641 --> 00:56:03.586
- Take somebody with you.
- Yeah, I'll take, uh...

658
00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.279
I'll go with him.

659
00:56:10.993 --> 00:56:11.952
Chef?

660
00:56:12.795 --> 00:56:14.755
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?

661
00:56:15.914 --> 00:56:18.166
- Call me what, sir?
- "Chef."

662
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:21.995
- Because you like mangoes and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real Chef.

663
00:56:22.963 --> 00:56:26.258
- I'm a Saucier.
- Saucier?

664
00:56:27.009 --> 00:56:28.331
Yes, sir.

665
00:56:28.755 --> 00:56:33.140
See, I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a Saucier.

666
00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:35.008
A great Saucier.

667
00:56:35.434 --> 00:56:38.812
- What's a "Saucier"?
- We specialize in sauces.

668
00:56:42.816 --> 00:56:45.402
Gotta be a mango tree here, somewhere.

669
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:56.413
Then I... I was supposed to go to Paris,
study at the Escoffier School.

670
00:56:57.623 --> 00:57:00.751
But then I got, uh, orders for my physical.

671
00:57:13.914 --> 00:57:17.100
Hell, I joined the Navy.
Heard they had better food.

672
00:57:18.477 --> 00:57:20.479
A "Cook School."
That did it.

673
00:57:20.821 --> 00:57:24.424
- Oh, yeah? How's that?
- Oh, you don't want to hear about that...

674
00:57:27.536 --> 00:57:30.806
They lined us up in front
of 100 yards of prime rib...

675
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.284
All of us. You know,
lined up, lookin' at it?

676
00:57:35.035 --> 00:57:39.539
Magnificent meat, really!
Beautifully marbled...

677
00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:41.641
<i>"Magnifique!"</i>

678
00:57:41.984 --> 00:57:45.270
Next thing, they're throwin'
the meat into these big cauldrons....

679
00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:47.798
All of it! Boiling it!

680
00:57:49.174 --> 00:57:51.969
I looked inside, man.
It was turning gray...

681
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.097
I couldn't fuckin' believe that one!

682
00:57:55.873 --> 00:57:59.084
That's when I applied for Radioman School,
but then they gave me the Engine—

683
00:58:41.393 --> 00:58:42.469
What is it?

684
00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:46.106
Charlie?

685
00:58:57.284 --> 00:58:58.702
It's a tiger!

686
00:59:02.122 --> 00:59:04.291
Tiger, man! It's a tiger!

687
00:59:05.359 --> 00:59:06.669
Battle Stations! Lance, up front!

688
00:59:06.793 --> 00:59:08.211
- On the .60, Clean!
- You got it, man.

689
00:59:08.295 --> 00:59:09.421
Holy shit.

690
00:59:09.504 --> 00:59:12.966
- Chef, come on!
- Fucking tiger!

691
00:59:13.075 --> 00:59:15.202
- Captain, come on!
- What's happening?!

692
00:59:16.344 --> 00:59:17.721
- Let's go!
- Tiger!

693
00:59:18.572 --> 00:59:20.792
Chief, you were right!
<i>"Never get out of the fuckin' boat!"</i>

694
00:59:20.858 --> 00:59:23.986
- Clean, bring that .60 forward!
- <i>"Never get out of the boat!"</i>

695
00:59:24.269 --> 00:59:26.434
<i>"Never get out of the boat!"</i>
I gotta remember! I gotta remember!

696
00:59:26.558 --> 00:59:28.932
<i>"Never get out of the boat!"
"Never get out of the boat!"</i>

697
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:34.988
- What happened? How many is it?
- A fucking tiger!

698
00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:36.698
- What?!
- A fucking tiger!

699
00:59:36.782 --> 00:59:39.493
- "Tiger?"
- Yes! I've had it!

700
00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:43.080
I've had the whole
Goddamn fucking shit, man!

701
00:59:43.263 --> 00:59:47.834
You can kiss my ass on the county square,
'cause I'm fuckin' buggin' out...

702
00:59:47.918 --> 00:59:52.172
I didn't come here for this!
I don't fuckin' need it! I don't want it!

703
00:59:52.672 --> 00:59:56.093
I didn't get out of the Goddamn
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

704
00:59:57.277 --> 00:59:59.137
All I wanted to do was fuckin' cook!

705
00:59:59.621 --> 01:00:01.973
I just wanted to learn
to fuckin' cook, man!

706
01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:05.852
- It's all right... It's all right...
- Hey, Goddamn! What happened, bro?

707
01:00:07.696 --> 01:00:09.374
You're all right...
You're gonna be all right..

708
01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:12.376
- All right... It's all right...
- You're all right.

709
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.946
It's gonna be all right...
<i>"Never get out of the fucking boat..."</i>

710
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:20.909
<i>"Never get out of the fucking boat..."</i>
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Goodbye!

711
01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:24.913
<i>"Never get out of the boat."</i>

712
01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:27.457
<i>Absolutely Goddamn right.</i>

713
01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:31.628
<i>Unless you were goin' all the way.</i>

714
01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.760
<i>Kurtz got off the boat.</i>

715
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.681
<i>He split from the whole fuckin' program.</i>

716
01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.602
<i>How did that happen?</i>

717
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.939
<i>What did he see here, that first tour?</i>

718
01:00:58.113 --> 01:00:59.906
<i>Thirty-eight fucking years old.</i>

719
01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:05.704
<i>If you joined the Green Berets, there
was no way you'd ever get above Colonel.</i>

720
01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:08.999
<i>Kurtz knew what he was giving up.</i>

721
01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:14.963
<i>And the more I read, and began
to understand, the more I admired him.</i>

722
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:18.934
<i>His family and friends
couldn't understand it.</i>

723
01:01:19.017 --> 01:01:20.602
<i>And they couldn't talk him out of it.</i>

724
01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:26.558
<i>He had to apply three times,
and he put up with a ton of shit.</i>

725
01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:29.686
<i>But when he threatened to resign,
they gave it to him.</i>

726
01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:37.152
<i>The next youngest guy
in his class was half his age.</i>

727
01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.780
<i>They must have thought
he was some far-out old man,</i>

728
01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:42.699
<i>humpin' it over that course.</i>

729
01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:47.037
<i>I did it when I was 19,
and it damn near wasted me.</i>

730
01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:51.708
<i>A tough motherfucker...</i>

731
01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:54.811
<i>He finished it.</i>

732
01:01:57.756 --> 01:01:59.507
<i>He could have gone for General,</i>

733
01:02:01.334 --> 01:02:03.253
<i>but he went for himself, instead.</i>

734
01:02:06.573 --> 01:02:08.116
<i>"Dear Eva,</i>

735
01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:13.897
<i>"today was really a new one.
Almost got eaten alive by a fuckin' tiger.</i>

736
01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:18.610
<i>"Really UN-fuckin'-believable, you know?</i>

737
01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:21.488
<i>"We're takin' this guy, Captain Willard,
up the river,</i>

738
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.571
<i>"but he hasn't told us
yet where we're takin' him."</i>

739
01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:30.389
<i>"Thought you might have heard by
now from Elwood. I'll be comin' home—“</i>

740
01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.582
<i>October 1967,</i>

741
01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:35.877
<i>on special assignment, Kon Tum Province,
II Corps.</i>

742
01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:39.381
<i>Kurtz staged Operation Archangel
with combined local forces.</i>

743
01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:41.883
<i>Rated a major success.</i>

744
01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:49.599
<i>He received no official clearance.
He just thought it up and did it.</i>

745
01:02:52.243 --> 01:02:53.620
<i>What balls.</i>

746
01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.608
<i>They were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards, for that one.</i>

747
01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:02.404
<i>But after the press got a hold of it,
they promoted him to full Colonel instead.</i>

748
01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:06.674
<i>Oh, man...</i>

749
01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:10.036
<i>the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam,</i>

750
01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.955
<i>you needed wings to stay above it.</i>

751
01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.154
<i>This sure enough is a bizarre
sight in the middle of this shit.</i>

752
01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.424
Expectin' us this time?

753
01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:51.002
Damned if I know.

754
01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:59.961
- <i>Hello? Hello?</i>
- Jesus...

755
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.762
<i>Everything goes
back up into the truck.</i>

756
01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:09.846
<i>What?</i>

757
01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:11.956
- <i>Yeah, we gotta get all that stuff up—</i>
- <i>Yeah, into the truck.</i>

758
01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.541
Hau Phat...
You ever been up here before, Chef?

759
01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:22.793
- <i>Let's go!</i>
- I bet you we can score up here.

760
01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:25.320
Yo, man, check out the bikes, Lance.

761
01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:29.115
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!

762
01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.576
- That's a good one!
- Yeah, Sukiyaki.

763
01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.037
Yeah, man. This is something.

764
01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:38.308
<i>Please!</i>

765
01:04:38.391 --> 01:04:40.643
- This must be the guy, right?
- Right over there.

766
01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.281
Sergeant. Sergeant?

767
01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:53.139
Three drums of diesel fuel, PBR 5.

768
01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:56.851
Come on, man! Move! We don't have time.
One hour. That's all. What do you want?

769
01:04:57.035 --> 01:04:58.395
Can I get some Panama Red with it?

770
01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:01.189
"Panama Red"? Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

771
01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:03.733
- Sergeant?
- Destination?

772
01:05:03.917 --> 01:05:05.553
- I don't have no destination.
- I can't do a Goddamn thing

773
01:05:05.677 --> 01:05:07.570
without a destination.
You got a destination?

774
01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:08.798
- Sergeant.
- I need diesel fuel.

775
01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:10.925
All right. You got a destination? 
I need a destination.

776
01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:12.576
I can't do a Goddamn
thing without a destination.

777
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.686
Hey, Sarge, sorry,
these guys are with me.

778
01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:15.995
Destination's classified.

779
01:05:16.179 --> 01:05:18.581
I carry priority papers from
COMSEC Intelligence, II Corps.

780
01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:21.668
Okay, right, sir...
Hey, listen, it's a real big night—

781
01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:22.886
Eight bucks for that, camo.

782
01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:27.006
All right. Damn.

783
01:05:28.207 --> 01:05:30.960
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.

784
01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:34.180
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.

785
01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:37.842
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's, uh, really bad around here, and...

786
01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:41.771
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk and you got it.

787
01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:45.191
Hey, listen, would you guys like, uh, some
seats, some press box seats for the show?

788
01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:45.953
You want those?

789
01:05:45.977 --> 01:05:48.077
- $500 a piece? C'mon, man.
- The show! The show, out here!

790
01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:50.989
- Bunnies!
- Who? Bugs Bunny? The Playboy Bunnies?

791
01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:52.866
You got it.
Hey, you gonna be here?

792
01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.367
Hey, listen, Captain...

793
01:05:55.343 --> 01:05:57.720
On the house. No hard feelings, huh?

794
01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:36.618
<i>How you doing out there?</i>

795
01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:40.413
<i>I said, “how you doing out there?"</i>

796
01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:44.417
<i>Want to say hello to you from all of us,
up here... to all of you, out there...</i>

797
01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:47.812
<i>who worked so Goddamn hard
in Operation Brute Force!</i>

798
01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:50.507
<i>Hello, all you Paratroopers out there!</i>

799
01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:54.135
<i>And the Marines! And the Sailors!</i>

800
01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:57.156
<i>We want to let you know
that we're proud of you!</i>

801
01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.991
<i>'Cause we know how tough
and how hard it's been.</i>

802
01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:00.550
<i>Yeah!</i>

803
01:07:01.034 --> 01:07:04.562
<i>And to prove it, we're gonna give you some
entertainment we know you're gonna like!</i>

804
01:07:04.746 --> 01:07:07.732
<i>Miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty.</i>

805
01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:14.197
<i>Miss May, Miss Terry Teray! Yeah!</i>

806
01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:19.702
<i>And the Playmate of the Year:
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!</i>

807
01:07:20.626 --> 01:07:23.326
- Check that out! Ho-ho!
- Get the fuck out of the way!

808
01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:32.650
Hello, up there!

809
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.840
Let's play Cowboys and Indians!

810
01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.256
- Hey man, what's the matter?
- C'mon!

811
01:08:13.739 --> 01:08:15.925
I want that girl's push-up brazzier, tonight!

812
01:08:20.282 --> 01:08:22.282
- Woo-hoo!
- Rock 'n' Roll!

813
01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:23.766
Grease my gun!

814
01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.068
I'm ready to bow-wow, baby!

815
01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:53.171
You're cute. I like you, sweetie!

816
01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:56.341
I'm here, baby! I'm here!

817
01:08:58.468 --> 01:08:59.752
Oh, my God, help me!

818
01:09:01.262 --> 01:09:02.347
Yeah!

819
01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:05.975
- You fucking bitch!
- Take it off!

820
01:09:06.599 --> 01:09:07.599
<i>Take it off!</i>

821
01:09:07.623 --> 01:09:09.455
<i>Take it off!</i>

822
01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.856
Hey, lover!
You want us to come over?

823
01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:15.177
- I sure do!
- Sign my centerfold!

824
01:09:15.301 --> 01:09:17.801
- Take it off! Take it off!
- Take it off! Take it off!

825
01:09:17.945 --> 01:09:19.606
<i>Sign my centerfold!</i>

826
01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:23.076
Come on, baby! Come up here, now.

827
01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:25.328
Get your Goddamn hands off of my girl!

828
01:09:36.547 --> 01:09:37.840
Start her up.

829
01:09:42.887 --> 01:09:43.930
Come on!

830
01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:48.351
Will you sign these?

831
01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.770
Girls! Let's go!

832
01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:10.957
So long!

833
01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:56.461
<i>Charlie didn't get much USO.</i>

834
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.673
<i>He was dug in too deep or moving too fast.</i>

835
01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:09.098
<i>His idea of great R&R was
cold rice and a little rat meat.</i>

836
01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:13.227
<i>He had only two ways home,</i>

837
01:11:14.745 --> 01:11:17.540
<i>death or victory.</i>

838
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.121
<i>No wonder Kurtz put
a weed up Command's ass...</i>

839
01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:36.459
<i>The war was being run
by a bunch of Four-Star Clowns</i>

840
01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.795
<i>who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away.</i>

841
01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.300
Man, you know, man
that was far-fuckin'-out...

842
01:11:44.483 --> 01:11:47.403
I collected every picture of her
since she was Miss December, Chief.

843
01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.389
Hey, Clean, look at that...
She was here, man!

844
01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:54.060
I even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.

845
01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:56.395
You can really get hung
up on these broads, man,

846
01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:58.105
just like that cat in the delta.

847
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:59.829
- Yeah, you better believe it.
- What cat?

848
01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:03.402
The one that went up for murder.
He was an Army Sergeant.

849
01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:07.114
Remember? This cat, man,
he really dug his Playboy, man.

850
01:12:07.198 --> 01:12:11.878
I mean like, this cat, when the thing arrived,
he was there to meet it, man.

851
01:12:12.002 --> 01:12:12.830
He just knew!

852
01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:15.665
Look at these beautiful fuckin' jugs, man!

853
01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.228
Yeah. So anyway,
he was working ARVN patrols, you know,

854
01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:22.797
had one of them cocky gook
asshole Lieutenants and shit.

855
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.026
And one day, the gook took his magazine
from him and wouldn't give it back to him.

856
01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:29.262
He said, <i>“give me my magazine back."</i>
Gook said,

857
01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:32.056
<i>"You shut up. I have you court-martial."</i>

858
01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:32.741
Y'know?

859
01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:34.851
- Typical fuckin' ARVN, man...
- Yeah, man...

860
01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:38.938
- So, like then, the gook starts to go too far, see.
- Chef, take the wheel.

861
01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:42.483
This dude started to stick
pinholes in the lady's titties.

862
01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:44.551
- Take the wheel.
- Right, well...

863
01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:45.937
He started stickin'... pinholes

864
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.115
and mutilatin' the centerfold,
and all kinds of shit like that.

865
01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:52.201
And the Sergeant said,
<i>"you better not do that to her.</i>

866
01:12:52.285 --> 01:12:54.620
<i>"You leave your shitty little
gook hands off of that girl.</i>

867
01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:56.247
<i>"Don't do her like that,"</i> right?

868
01:12:56.430 --> 01:13:00.476
- Gook say, <i>"fuck you,"</i> in Vietnamese, yeah?
- Damn.

869
01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.463
The Sergeant, man,
he just couldn't handle it no more.

870
01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:09.802
He just picked up his iron,
flipped it to Rock 'n' Roll and...

871
01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:14.348
Gave that little zero a long burst,
straight through the Playboy mag,

872
01:13:14.432 --> 01:13:17.101
and blew his ass clean off of the dock.

873
01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:21.272
There wasn't no more Lieutenant that day.
That was it for his ass.

874
01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:26.944
- They burn him for it?
- The Sergeant? Yeah, man.

875
01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:28.988
They stuck his ass in the LBJ.

876
01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:32.158
It's too bad he didn't
get no medals or nothing.

877
01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:38.539
Fuckin' ARVN, man.
They should have killed the fuck.

878
01:13:40.591 --> 01:13:42.685
Should have given
the fucker a Silver Star.

879
01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.339
Bummer for the gook, though, ain't it?

880
01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:56.515
<i>Good morning, Vietnam.

<i>Request Dust-Off.
Three, maybe four KIAs. Over.</i>

986
01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:35.159
Shove it, fuck-up!

987
01:22:35.242 --> 01:22:36.982
I sure am sorry about that!

988
01:22:37.006 --> 01:22:38.662
If I had known, I'd have
taken you to New Orleans...

989
01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:41.081
- Man, fuck you.
- Introduce you to Cooze, Bubba!

990
01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:42.967
You're a fucking dog!

991
01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:43.936
Come on down to New Orleans, Bubba,

992
01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.629
- and I'll get you fixed up, you prick.
- Lay off him, Chef.

993
01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:49.631
You're the only fuckin'
prick I see around here.

994
01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.976
And if I want to play with a prick,
I'll play with my own!

995
01:22:52.059 --> 01:22:54.399
- Lay off, Chef!
- What you gonna do with it, cherry boy?

996
01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:56.847
- Fucking cherry boy!
- Chef, I said lay off!

997
01:22:56.930 --> 01:23:01.727
Chef, knock it off! Give him a break!
What do you think I said?

998
01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:03.437
And give your jaws a rest!

999
01:23:04.388 --> 01:23:07.057
And this ain't the Army. You are a Sailor!

1000
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:11.812
So get out of that frizzly Army-lookin' shit, 
and stop smokin' that dope!

1001
01:23:12.095 --> 01:23:13.096
You hear me?!

1002
01:23:17.851 --> 01:23:20.162
Lance, what's with all the green paint?

1003
01:23:20.445 --> 01:23:22.480
- Camouflage.
- How's that?

1004
01:23:23.048 --> 01:23:24.609
So they can't see ya.
They're everywhere, Chief.

1005
01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:28.628
Uh-huh. I want you to stay awake
up there, man. You got a job to do...

1006
01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:50.734
Sampan off the port bow. Sampan
off the port bow. Let's take a look.

1007
01:23:51.818 --> 01:23:53.279
Lance. Bring 'em in.

1008
01:23:53.603 --> 01:23:55.730
Clean, on the .60. Chef, get a 16.

1009
01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:58.475
Clean, get on that .60!

1010
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.012
What's up, Chief?

1011
01:24:05.248 --> 01:24:07.301
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

1012
01:24:08.485 --> 01:24:10.313
Well, let's forget routine now,
and let 'em go.

1013
01:24:10.937 --> 01:24:12.881
These boats are runnin'
supplies in this delta, Captain.

1014
01:24:13.565 --> 01:24:14.491
I'm gonna take a look.

1015
01:24:16.159 --> 01:24:17.644
Chief, my mission's got priority, here.

1016
01:24:17.727 --> 01:24:19.907
Hell, you wouldn't even be in this
part of the river if it wasn't for me.

1017
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:24.117
Until we reach your destination, Captain,
you're just on for the ride...

1018
01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:28.280
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on, throw the rope, asshole.

1019
01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:30.874
All right. Come on.
Let's bring it over.

1020
01:24:44.829 --> 01:24:46.910
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

1021
01:24:54.106 --> 01:24:56.274
Come on! Hurry up, motherfucker!
Move it!

1022
01:24:58.811 --> 01:25:01.051
- You two, come on.
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.

1023
01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:02.681
I got you, Chief.

1024
01:25:07.377 --> 01:25:08.503
It's clear, Chief.

1025
01:25:14.926 --> 01:25:18.138
Okay, that's them.
That's them. They're okay.

1026
01:25:18.321 --> 01:25:19.264
Board and search it.

1027
01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:22.360
It's just a fuckin' boat.
There ain't nothin' on it, Chief.

1028
01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:23.277
Board it and search it.

1029
01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.246
Just some baskets and some ducks...
fuckin' bananas...

1030
01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:28.249
- There ain't nothin' on it...
- Don't be ashamed, Chef.

1031
01:25:28.273 --> 01:25:29.550
- What's wrong with you? Go on and search it.
- Look...

1032
01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:32.001
There's the goat...
And some fish...

1033
01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:33.971
- Chef!
- Bunch of fuckin' vegetables—

1034
01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:35.348
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothin' on that fuckin' boat—

1035
01:25:35.572 --> 01:25:36.307
There's nothin' on it, man!

1036
01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:37.874
- Get on it!
- Fine! All right!

1037
01:25:38.642 --> 01:25:42.045
Move it, asshole! Move it!
God damn it! Just some pigs...

1038
01:25:42.428 --> 01:25:43.647
Look, mangoes...

1039
01:25:43.730 --> 01:25:45.732
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fuckin' rice!

1040
01:25:46.015 --> 01:25:48.643
- Look in there, Chef! Look in it!
- Some fuckin' fish...

1041
01:25:49.527 --> 01:25:52.347
More coconuts. Rice. Here's rice!

1042
01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:55.277
What's in that vegetable basket?

1043
01:25:55.425 --> 01:25:58.678
Get out of here! C'mon!
Get over there, God damn it.

1044
01:25:58.762 --> 01:26:00.265
Chef, check that vegetable basket!

1045
01:26:00.589 --> 01:26:01.941
- All right!
- Shut up, Slope!

1046
01:26:02.265 --> 01:26:03.943
- There ain't nothin' in here!
- What's in the boxes?

1047
01:26:04.067 --> 01:26:05.110
Not a fuckin' thing...

1048
01:26:05.393 --> 01:26:06.528
- Look in that tin can.
- Nothin'...

1049
01:26:06.711 --> 01:26:09.089
- That rusty can.
- It's just fuckin' rice, and that's all!

1050
01:26:09.172 --> 01:26:10.383
- There ain't nothin' on it!
- Check the yellow can.

1051
01:26:10.407 --> 01:26:12.688
Check the yellow can!
She was sittin' on it. What's in it?

1052
01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:17.898
Chef!

1053
01:26:23.219 --> 01:26:24.512
Motherfuckers!

1054
01:26:28.336 --> 01:26:30.836
Motherfuckin' gooks!
Cocksuckers!

1055
01:26:33.463 --> 01:26:35.765
- Hold it! Hold it!
- Come on, let's kill them all, huh, idiots?!

1056
01:26:35.949 --> 01:26:38.476
- Fucking cocksucking mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!

1057
01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:41.087
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit out of all of 'em, huh?!

1058
01:26:41.171 --> 01:26:44.541
- Hold it, Chef, hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ...

1059
01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.527
Why the fuck not?

1060
01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:50.872
- Clean?
- I'm good.

1061
01:26:59.522 --> 01:27:01.701
- You okay, Lance?
- Cocksucking mother fucker! Shit!

1062
01:27:01.725 --> 01:27:03.977
- Chef!
- Look what she was hidin', huh?!

1063
01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.846
- You all right?
- See what she was runnin' for?!

1064
01:27:10.650 --> 01:27:12.444
It's a fuckin' puppy!

1065
01:27:13.570 --> 01:27:14.863
It's a fuckin' puppy...

1066
01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:17.324
Gimme that dog.

1067
01:27:18.108 --> 01:27:20.002
- No, you're not gonna get it!
- Fucking give it to me!

1068
01:27:20.226 --> 01:27:22.395
No! Give me the fuckin'
dog, you asshole!

1069
01:27:22.679 --> 01:27:23.488
Fuck you!

1070
01:27:24.848 --> 01:27:26.891
- Chef, she—
- A fuckin' mango, too!

1071
01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:27.776
You want that?!

1072
01:27:27.959 --> 01:27:30.240
Chef, she's movin' behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

1073
01:27:30.364 --> 01:27:30.963
You can fuckin' have it.

1074
01:27:31.187 --> 01:27:32.013
- Chef!
- Yes?!

1075
01:27:32.097 --> 01:27:33.807
She's movin' behind you!
Check her out!

1076
01:27:34.090 --> 01:27:36.059
All right. All right.

1077
01:27:36.401 --> 01:27:37.878
- Come on, Clean, God damn it.
- She's not dead, she's wounded.

1078
01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:39.181
- Give me a hand.
- Clean, give him a hand.

1079
01:27:40.872 --> 01:27:44.701
Just take it easy, there! Take it easy!
Slow down and take it easy.

1080
01:27:45.485 --> 01:27:47.346
All right, Chef, just wait a minute. 
Wait a minute, Chef.

1081
01:27:47.370 --> 01:27:48.789
- Bring her up, here...
- Is she breathin', Chef?

1082
01:27:49.013 --> 01:27:52.158
- She's hurt... She's bleedin'...
- Oh, man...

1083
01:27:52.442 --> 01:27:55.003
Bring her on board.
We're takin' her to an ARVN.

1084
01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:56.805
What are you talkin' about?

1085
01:27:57.188 --> 01:27:58.324
We're takin' her to some friendlies, Captain.

1086
01:27:58.448 --> 01:27:59.849
She's wounded, she's not dead.

1087
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:02.361
- Get out of there, Chef.
- The book says, Captain—

1088
01:28:13.897 --> 01:28:16.191
Fuck you...
Fuck him...

1089
01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.540
I told you not to stop.
Now, let's go.

1090
01:29:19.796 --> 01:29:22.590
<i>It was the way we had
over here of living with ourselves.</i>

1091
01:29:23.967 --> 01:29:26.886
<i>We'd cut them in half with a machine gun
and give them a band-aid.</i>

1092
01:29:29.572 --> 01:29:31.074
<i>It was a lie.</i>

1093
01:29:32.008 --> 01:29:33.759
<i>And the more I saw of them,</i>

1094
01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:36.496
<i>the more I hated lies.</i>

1095
01:29:38.915 --> 01:29:42.219
<i>Those boys were never gonna
look at me the same way, again.</i>

1096
01:29:43.628 --> 01:29:46.214
<i>But I felt like I knew one
or two things about Kurtz</i>

1097
01:29:46.297 --> 01:29:48.308
<i>that weren't in the dossier...</i>

1098
01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:57.442
<i>Do Luong Bridge was the last
Army outpost on the Nung River.</i>

1099
01:30:01.879 --> 01:30:04.215
<i>Beyond that, there was only Kurtz.</i>

1100
01:30:06.442 --> 01:30:09.971
Lance! Hey, Lance, what do you think?

1101
01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:11.697
It's beautiful...

1102
01:30:12.849 --> 01:30:16.185
Huh? I mean, what's the matter with you?
You actin' kind of weird.

1103
01:30:17.537 --> 01:30:20.256
Hey, you know that last
tab of acid I was saving?

1104
01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:22.926
- Yeah.
- I dropped it.

1105
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:25.862
You dropped acid? Far out.

1106
01:30:37.707 --> 01:30:40.960
- Take me home!
- God damn you!

1107
01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:54.916
God damn!
You'll get what you deserve!

1108
01:31:03.132 --> 01:31:05.885
<i>Is there a Captain Willard on board?</i>

1109
01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:07.369
- Yeah!
- <i>Captain Willard?</i>

1110
01:31:07.528 --> 01:31:10.365
- Yeah, who's that?
- <i>Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.</i>

1111
01:31:10.648 --> 01:31:11.857
Get that light off me!

1112
01:31:13.659 --> 01:31:16.396
I was sent here from Nha Trang
with these three days ago, sir.

1113
01:31:16.579 --> 01:31:19.649
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

1114
01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.901
You don't know how happy
this makes me, sir...

1115
01:31:22.185 --> 01:31:23.653
- Why?
- Now I can get out of here,

1116
01:31:23.936 --> 01:31:25.271
if I can find a way.

1117
01:31:29.525 --> 01:31:32.236
You're in the asshole
of the world, Captain!

1118
01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:38.584
Captain, where you goin'?

1119
01:31:38.668 --> 01:31:41.337
See if I can find some fuel,
get some information.

1120
01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:46.959
- Pick me up the other side of the bridge.
- Somebody go with him. Chef!

1121
01:31:47.043 --> 01:31:49.879
I'll go. I wanna go.

1122
01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:06.237
<i>You get your ass in gear.</i>

1123
01:32:41.598 --> 01:32:44.851
Come on, man.
Listen to the music, man.

1124
01:32:45.710 --> 01:32:47.028
Where can I find the CO?

1125
01:32:47.211 --> 01:32:49.489
You came right to it,
son of a bitch!

1126
01:32:49.572 --> 01:32:52.909
Lance! Get down here!

1127
01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:58.223
You still got a Commanding Officer, here?

1128
01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:01.317
- Beverly Hills.
- What?

1129
01:33:01.501 --> 01:33:06.197
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fuckin' bunker called Beverly Hills.

1130
01:33:06.481 --> 01:33:08.966
Where the fuck else do
you think it would be?

1131
01:33:44.227 --> 01:33:46.020
God damn it,
you stepped in my face!

1132
01:33:46.103 --> 01:33:48.583
- We thought you were dead.
- Well, you thought wrong, damn it.

1133
01:33:52.902 --> 01:33:54.887
I done told you to stop
fuckin' with me, didn't I?

1134
01:33:55.071 --> 01:33:56.464
You think you're so bad, huh, nigga?

1135
01:33:57.506 --> 01:33:58.683
What are you shootin' at, Soldier?

1136
01:33:58.766 --> 01:34:01.010
Gooks, man! What the fuck you
think I'm shootin' at?!

1137
01:34:01.436 --> 01:34:03.947
Sir! I'm sorry, sir...
There are gooks out there by The Wire,

1138
01:34:04.330 --> 01:34:08.084
- but I think I killed them all.
- Oh, you ain't shot shit, man. Listen!

1139
01:34:09.969 --> 01:34:12.122
Oh, shit, he's trying to call his friends, man.
Send up a flare!

1140
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:23.524
You think you're so bad, huh nigga?!
You think you bad, huh?!

1141
01:34:23.808 --> 01:34:27.403
They're all dead, stupid. 
There's one still alive underneath them bodies.

1142
01:34:28.204 --> 01:34:29.690
Who's the Commanding Officer, here?

1143
01:34:30.873 --> 01:34:31.808
Ain't you?

1144
01:34:34.477 --> 01:34:35.570
You think you're so bad, huh?!

1145
01:34:35.953 --> 01:34:38.213
I got somethin' for your ass now, nigga!

1146
01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:39.683
Got somethin' for you, now!

1147
01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:44.053
He's underneath them bodies, man!

1148
01:34:45.705 --> 01:34:48.167
- Go get the roach, man.
- Go get the roach, man.

1149
01:34:48.191 --> 01:34:51.652
- Go get the roach, nigga!
- I'm gonna go get the roach.

1150
01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:59.677
Roach. Roach. Roach.

1151
01:35:00.669 --> 01:35:03.080
Got slopes on The Wire, man.
Do ya hear 'em?

1152
01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:05.366
- Lance!
- Do ya hear 'em?

1153
01:35:10.479 --> 01:35:11.539
Go bust 'em!

1154
01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:17.920
<i>Hey, GI, fuck you!</i>

1155
01:35:27.146 --> 01:35:28.698
You hear him out there on The Wire, man?

1156
01:35:30.333 --> 01:35:33.628
- Yeah.
- <i>I'll kill you, GI!</i>

1157
01:35:34.211 --> 01:35:35.295
You need a flare?

1158
01:35:36.719 --> 01:35:37.719
No.

1159
01:35:39.725 --> 01:35:40.760
He's close, man.

1160
01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:43.446
He's real close.

1161
01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:08.137
<i>GI, fuck you!</i>

1162
01:36:09.661 --> 01:36:10.661
<i>Hey, GI!</i>

1163
01:36:11.107 --> 01:36:12.800
<i>GI, fuck y—</i>

1164
01:36:18.497 --> 01:36:19.957
Muthafucka...

1165
01:36:20.983 --> 01:36:22.102
Hey, Soldier...

1166
01:36:26.664 --> 01:36:28.624
Do you know who's in command, here?

1167
01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:32.403
Yeah.

1168
01:36:46.992 --> 01:36:48.994
Holy... shit!

1169
01:36:53.949 --> 01:36:56.944
Yo, Chief, man,
two guys just got blown off that bridge.

1170
01:36:57.228 --> 01:36:59.372
You hang on, man. You're gonna be okay.

1171
01:37:03.926 --> 01:37:05.761
- What's that?
- Mail, man.

1172
01:37:05.845 --> 01:37:08.097
Later on the mail! Watch them trees.

1173
01:37:10.650 --> 01:37:13.036
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1174
01:37:13.519 --> 01:37:14.304
Let's move out.

1175
01:37:15.287 --> 01:37:19.034
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fuckin' CO, here.

1176
01:37:21.235 --> 01:37:24.905
- Let's just get going.
- Which way, Captain?

1177
01:37:30.995 --> 01:37:32.797
You know which way, Chief.

1178
01:37:33.789 --> 01:37:35.283
You're on your own, Captain.

1179
01:37:37.101 --> 01:37:38.294
Do ya wanna go on?

1180
01:37:39.094 --> 01:37:43.007
Like this bridge: we build it every night,
Charlie blows it right back up again.

1181
01:37:43.090 --> 01:37:45.760
Just so the Generals
can say the road's open.

1182
01:37:46.402 --> 01:37:47.203
Think about it.

1183
01:37:50.890 --> 01:37:52.809
- Who cares?!
- Just get us upriver!

1184
01:37:57.913 --> 01:38:00.291
Chef, on the bow.

1185
01:38:01.558 --> 01:38:03.435
- Standby, Clean.
- Let's go!

1186
01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.627
Whose package is that?

1187
01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:05.981
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit! Wait a minute, is that it?

1188
01:39:06.215 --> 01:39:08.092
- That's it, for you.
- Lance!

1189
01:39:08.659 --> 01:39:10.953
Mr. L.B. Johnson, there ya go!

1190
01:39:12.496 --> 01:39:15.458
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waiting for this one.

1191
01:39:15.941 --> 01:39:18.903
I got another one,
got a box from Eva.

1192
01:39:19.286 --> 01:39:21.722
<i>"Lance, I'm fine. I'm fine, Lance.</i>

1193
01:39:22.106 --> 01:39:25.734
<i>"Sue and I went tripping to Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."</i>

1194
01:39:25.818 --> 01:39:29.071
- I want to get back to Antoine's.
- <i>"I remember the time we went..."</i>

1195
01:39:29.154 --> 01:39:31.740
How could I fuckin' forget, man?
Beautiful.

1196
01:39:32.925 --> 01:39:35.469
<i>"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?</i>

1197
01:39:35.452 --> 01:39:36.704
<i>"Let me know."</i>

1198
01:39:36.787 --> 01:39:40.249
Jim, it's here. It really is here.

1199
01:39:41.473 --> 01:39:43.473
No, it really is here, though...

1200
01:39:44.653 --> 01:39:47.048
<i>"There has been a new
development regarding your mission</i>

1201
01:39:47.172 --> 01:39:49.450
<i>"which we must now communicate to you.</i>

1202
01:39:49.533 --> 01:39:51.477
<i>"Months ago, a man was 
ordered on a mission</i>

1203
01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.229
<i>"which was identical to yours.</i>

1204
01:39:53.971 --> 01:39:57.600
<i>"We have reason to believe that he
is now operating with Colonel Kurtz.</i>

1205
01:39:59.335 --> 01:40:02.888
<i>"Saigon was carrying him
MIA for his family's sake.</i>

1206
01:40:03.172 --> 01:40:05.008
<i>"They assumed he was dead.</i>

1207
01:40:05.591 --> 01:40:08.677
<i>"Then, they intercepted a letter
he tried to send to his wife."</i>

1208
01:40:12.973 --> 01:40:14.717
<i>Captain Richard Colby.</i>

1209
01:40:17.036 --> 01:40:18.704
<i>He was with Kurtz.</i>

1210
01:40:20.022 --> 01:40:21.190
"Disneyland?"

1211
01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:24.844
Fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.

1212
01:40:24.927 --> 01:40:27.888
<i>"Charles Miller Manson
ordered the slaughter</i>

1213
01:40:28.072 --> 01:40:31.367
<i>"of all in the home anyway, 
as a symbol of protest."</i>

1214
01:40:31.450 --> 01:40:32.970
That's really weird, ain't it?

1215
01:40:34.219 --> 01:40:37.122
- <i>'Purple Haze,'</i> look!
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1216
01:40:37.306 --> 01:40:40.735
- I got a tape from my mom...
- Chief, <i>'Rainbow Reality,'</i> man.

1217
01:40:41.018 --> 01:40:43.395
Hey... Chief, get a good whiff...

1218
01:40:43.579 --> 01:40:46.115
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.

1219
01:40:47.049 --> 01:40:49.844
She pictures me at home,
havin' a beer and watchin' TV.

1220
01:40:51.804 --> 01:40:53.622
Hey, Lance, man...

1221
01:40:53.706 --> 01:40:54.924
Hot potato! Hot potato!

1222
01:40:56.108 --> 01:40:57.961
<i>I'm so glad you decided
to join the Navy—</i>

1223
01:40:58.185 --> 01:41:01.146
Eva's not sure if she can have
a relationship with me, you know?

1224
01:41:02.106 --> 01:41:04.742
Here I am, 13,000 fuckin'
miles away...

1225
01:41:04.825 --> 01:41:07.536
tryin' to keep our relationship
"open," my ass...

1226
01:41:08.062 --> 01:41:11.482
<i>That's much more than I can say 
for some of your friends.</i>

1227
01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:15.423
<i>If this tape is any good,
I will have dad and the family</i>

1228
01:41:15.452 --> 01:41:17.814
- <i>send you a tape of their own...</i>
- Hey, Lance...

1229
01:41:37.582 --> 01:41:38.309
There! Over there!

1230
01:41:40.595 --> 01:41:42.471
Get it, motherfuckers!

1231
01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:55.267
There! Over there!

1232
01:41:58.996 --> 01:42:01.290
Lance! Chef!

1233
01:42:04.543 --> 01:42:09.506
- Chef, Chef, check out Clean!
- Captain, he's hit, he's hit! Clean's hit!

1234
01:42:10.065 --> 01:42:11.817
- Lance!
- Where'd the dog go?!

1235
01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:14.737
Lance! Lance, check out Clean!

1236
01:42:15.195 --> 01:42:17.998
Where's the dog?!
We gotta go back and get the dog!

1237
01:42:18.082 --> 01:42:19.191
Hey, Clean...

1238
01:42:19.275 --> 01:42:21.569
-<i>It's always been nice to have...</i>
- Hey...

1239
01:42:22.052 --> 01:42:23.829
Hey, Bubba!

1240
01:42:24.313 --> 01:42:26.690
Bubba, you can't die, you fucker!

1241
01:42:28.467 --> 01:42:31.036
- <i>And so, I'm hoping...</i>
- Hey, Bubba!

1242
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:36.275
<i>That pretty soon, not- not too soon,
but pretty soon,</i>

1243
01:42:36.359 --> 01:42:40.071
<i>I'll have a lot of grandchildren
to love and spoil,</i>

1244
01:42:40.255 --> 01:42:43.383
<i>and then when your wife get 'em back,
she'll be mad with me.</i>

1245
01:42:43.566 --> 01:42:44.984
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>

1246
01:42:45.835 --> 01:42:51.132
<i>Even aunt Jessie and mama will
come to celebrate your coming home.</i>

1247
01:42:51.532 --> 01:42:55.078
<i>Granny and dad are trying to
get enough money to get you a car.</i>

1248
01:42:55.261 --> 01:42:58.806
<i>But don't tell her,
because that's our secret.</i>

1249
01:43:00.183 --> 01:43:04.979
<i>Anyhow, do the right thing,
stay out of the way of the bullets,</i>

1250
01:43:05.421 --> 01:43:09.384
<i>and bring your heinie,
home all in one piece,</i>

1251
01:43:09.667 --> 01:43:13.838
<i>because we love you very much.
Love, Mama.</i>

1252
01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:26.442
Oh, man...
You shouldn't have to be so young...

1253
01:43:33.574 --> 01:43:35.142
Clean...

1254
01:44:47.807 --> 01:44:48.516
Hold on.

1255
01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:52.946
Throw me the glasses.

1256
01:45:05.950 --> 01:45:08.911
Lance, take the 16 on the bow.

1257
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:14.283
Chef. Chef! On the .60.

1258
01:45:37.173 --> 01:45:38.149
Fuck me...

1259
01:46:20.767 --> 01:46:22.167
<i>Your are surrounded!</i>

1260
01:46:26.343 --> 01:46:27.943
<i>Go away!</i>

1261
01:46:30.868 --> 01:46:32.368
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

1262
01:46:34.367 --> 01:46:36.567
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1263
01:46:37.492 --> 01:46:39.060
They're French! They're French!

1264
01:46:39.184 --> 01:46:40.662
I'm droping my weapon!

1265
01:46:40.686 --> 01:46:43.898
Chef, pick up that weapon!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1266
01:46:43.981 --> 01:46:45.742
Stand fast! Captain—

1267
01:46:45.766 --> 01:46:47.066
We are Americans!

1268
01:46:47.290 --> 01:46:49.790
We mean you no harm!

1269
01:46:51.514 --> 01:46:52.714
It's okay!

1270
01:46:52.738 --> 01:46:54.738
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

1271
01:47:21.227 --> 01:47:23.354
All right, you men...
Put down your weapons.

1272
01:47:33.778 --> 01:47:35.479
We are Americans.

1273
01:47:35.803 --> 01:47:36.879
We are friends.

1274
01:47:38.203 --> 01:47:39.049
We are friends!

1275
01:47:39.273 --> 01:47:40.079
We are friends...

1276
01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:55.695
We lost one of our men.

1277
01:47:59.490 --> 01:48:03.369
We French always pay
respects to the dead of our allies.

1278
01:48:06.505 --> 01:48:07.999
You're all welcome.

1279
01:48:11.051 --> 01:48:13.178
My name is Hubert de Marais.

1280
01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:16.732
This is my family's plantation.

1281
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:19.919
It has been such for 70 years.

1282
01:48:21.921 --> 01:48:24.673
And it will be such until we are all dead.

1283
01:48:30.747 --> 01:48:32.147
<i>To my command!</i>

1284
01:48:32.872 --> 01:48:33.772
Attention!

1285
01:48:34.396 --> 01:48:35.296
Shoulder!

1286
01:48:58.097 --> 01:49:00.097
Present arms!

1287
01:49:06.321 --> 01:49:07.421
Taps.

1288
01:50:36.805 --> 01:50:42.269
Captain, accept the flag of Tyrone Miller, 
on behalf of a grateful nation.

1289
01:51:02.123 --> 01:51:06.669
This food is really wonderful, isn't it?
The wine, the sauces. I can't believe it.

1290
01:51:07.352 --> 01:51:08.838
Hey, can I speak with the Chef?

1291
01:51:09.421 --> 01:51:11.032
Chef speak only Vietnamese.

1292
01:51:11.815 --> 01:51:15.378
No kiddin'? He cooks like this
and he can't even speak French?

1293
01:51:15.861 --> 01:51:18.530
Hey, Lance, the Chef's a slope.

1294
01:51:20.666 --> 01:51:22.418
Hey, Lance...

1295
01:51:38.142 --> 01:51:40.142
You still need to study with Mr. Robert.

1296
01:51:40.666 --> 01:51:41.466
Let’s go.

1297
01:51:41.490 --> 01:51:43.490
Not too bad.
Everyone to bed, now.

1298
01:51:51.146 --> 01:51:52.573
This is Baudelaire.

1299
01:51:52.756 --> 01:51:55.843
It's a very cruel poem for children,
but they need it,

1300
01:51:55.926 --> 01:51:58.595
because life, sometime, is very cruel.

1301
01:52:00.231 --> 01:52:01.857
As you can see...

1302
01:52:05.394 --> 01:52:09.231
- Attacks repells by the family.
- Just for this war.

1303
01:52:09.732 --> 01:52:12.401
Viet Cong, 58.

1304
01:52:12.484 --> 01:52:14.319
North Vietnamese, 12.

1305
01:52:15.029 --> 01:52:16.905
South Vietnamese, 11.

1306
01:52:17.823 --> 01:52:19.616
"Americans...6?"

1307
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.996
Yes, well, they were... perhaps mistake.

1308
01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:40.784
Ah, Roxanne...

1309
01:52:41.308 --> 01:52:43.020
You were curious to see
these Americans, weren’t you?

1310
01:52:43.344 --> 01:52:45.144
No, I was only hungry.

1311
01:52:45.184 --> 01:52:48.103
May I present Captain Willard?
He's of a Paratroop Regiment.

1312
01:52:48.687 --> 01:52:50.856
- Madame Sarrault.
- Captain.

1313
01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:06.480
<i>“An angel passes...”</i>

1314
01:53:06.504 --> 01:53:07.704
<i>“…Let’s butcher it!”</i>

1315
01:53:11.328 --> 01:53:12.927
Do you remember this story in Paris?

1316
01:53:13.651 --> 01:53:16.228
When the baron said, <i>“Let’s cut the angel?”</i>

1317
01:53:16.552 --> 01:53:18.252
I don’t think that is the subject tonight.

1318
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:21.270
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.
Was just a little story about Paris,

1319
01:53:21.453 --> 01:53:22.764
and people starving during the war.

1320
01:53:22.788 --> 01:53:24.873
They are around the table
and there was a silence.

1321
01:53:24.957 --> 01:53:27.751
Somebody said,<i>"an angel is passing by."</i>

1322
01:53:28.135 --> 01:53:31.054
So, uh, somebody said, <i>"let's eat it!"</i>

1323
01:53:31.938 --> 01:53:32.839
Oh...

1324
01:53:38.537 --> 01:53:42.124
How long... can you possibly stay here?

1325
01:53:42.407 --> 01:53:43.451
We stay forever.

1326
01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:46.653
No, no, I mean, uh...

1327
01:53:48.122 --> 01:53:50.290
when will you go back home, to France?

1328
01:53:53.577 --> 01:53:55.129
I mean, this is our home, Captain.

1329
01:53:55.871 --> 01:53:57.456
- Sooner or later you're gonna get—
- No!

1330
01:53:57.580 --> 01:53:58.580
Control yourself, please—

1331
01:53:58.604 --> 01:53:59.575
Silence!

1332
01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:03.270
You don't understand our mentality!
The French Officer mentality!

1333
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:06.523
At first, we lose in Second World War!

1334
01:54:06.706 --> 01:54:08.793
I don't say that you Americans win,
but we lose!

1335
01:54:09.617 --> 01:54:11.617
- Oh, please—
- Silence! I'm speaking!

1336
01:54:11.803 --> 01:54:14.681
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose!
In Nigeria, we lose!

1337
01:54:14.865 --> 01:54:16.458
In Indochina, we lose!

1338
01:54:17.225 --> 01:54:19.686
But here, we don't lose!

1339
01:54:20.554 --> 01:54:24.342
This piece of earth, we keep it!
We will never lose that, never!

1340
01:54:29.529 --> 01:54:32.949
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.

1341
01:54:33.033 --> 01:54:35.327
The Russian want to help them.

1342
01:54:35.410 --> 01:54:38.288
<i>"Come and give us some money.
We are all Communists.</i>

1343
01:54:38.372 --> 01:54:40.665
<i>"Chinese, give us gun.
We are all brothers!"</i>

1344
01:54:40.849 --> 01:54:42.309
They <i>hate</i> the Chinese!

1345
01:54:43.085 --> 01:54:46.647
Maybe they hate American <i>less</i>
than the Russian and the Chinese...

1346
01:54:47.631 --> 01:54:49.400
I mean, if tomorrow,
the Vietnamese are Communists,

1347
01:54:49.424 --> 01:54:51.676
they will be
<i>Vietnamese</i> Communists.

1348
01:54:52.302 --> 01:54:55.013
And <i>this</i> is something that you
never understood, you American.

1349
01:54:55.722 --> 01:54:56.878
Well, actually, I don't know.

1350
01:54:56.902 --> 01:55:00.727
Maybe in the future we can 
make something with the Viet Minh.

1351
01:55:00.811 --> 01:55:02.646
Don't you understand?

1352
01:55:02.729 --> 01:55:05.482
The VC say, <i>"Go away! Go away!"</i>

1353
01:55:05.565 --> 01:55:08.276
That's finished for all the
white people in Indochina!

1354
01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:11.655
If you're French, American...
That's all the same!

1355
01:55:11.738 --> 01:55:14.366
<i>"Go!"</i> They want to <i>forget</i> you.

1356
01:55:14.749 --> 01:55:15.792
Look at them!

1357
01:55:15.816 --> 01:55:17.512
Come on, Phillipe, 
that's enough, now!

1358
01:55:17.536 --> 01:55:20.288
Look! This is the truth. An egg.

1359
01:55:23.458 --> 01:55:24.301
The white left...

1360
01:55:26.403 --> 01:55:28.280
The yellow... stay!

1361
01:55:29.804 --> 01:55:31.504
Come on, stay with us!

1362
01:55:31.528 --> 01:55:32.504
What's going on?

1363
01:55:32.528 --> 01:55:34.628
 They don't want to face the truth!

1364
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:39.558
- All you white people are shit.
- They are fighting! Fighting for freedom!

1365
01:55:39.641 --> 01:55:42.060
"Freedom"? Bullshit!

1366
01:55:42.144 --> 01:55:47.774
Dien Bien Phu is a trap.
All soldiers <i>know</i> they are already dead.

1367
01:55:49.818 --> 01:55:51.736
You know anything about Dien Bien Phu?

1368
01:55:55.165 --> 01:55:58.001
- Yeah, I know.
- No, you don't.

1369
01:55:58.084 --> 01:55:58.827
Not really.

1370
01:55:59.010 --> 01:56:01.955
Dien Bien Phu was an error, you know?
A military mistake.

1371
01:56:02.238 --> 01:56:06.034
A "mistake"? A voluntary mistake!
Voluntary!

1372
01:56:07.002 --> 01:56:12.382
Our Paratroopers jump at 90 meters.
I mean, you know, 90 meters, 70 meters?

1373
01:56:12.466 --> 01:56:15.635
I mean, that's crazy!
No Army in the world can do that!

1374
01:56:16.019 --> 01:56:18.606
And they only do that
to be dead with their friends.

1375
01:56:19.389 --> 01:56:21.683
The French Army was sacrificed...

1376
01:56:21.766 --> 01:56:24.478
Sacrificed by the politicians,
safe at home.

1377
01:56:24.561 --> 01:56:27.281
They put the Army in an impossible
situation where they <i>couldn't</i> win.

1378
01:56:27.305 --> 01:56:28.358
You exaggerate.

1379
01:56:28.482 --> 01:56:31.985
The students are marching in Paris,
protesting, demonstrating...

1380
01:56:32.068 --> 01:56:34.321
They stab the soldiers in the back...

1381
01:56:34.404 --> 01:56:38.492
The Soldier would open the grenade,
it wouldn't work!

1382
01:56:38.575 --> 01:56:40.368
A piece of paper would fall...

1383
01:56:40.692 --> 01:56:42.392
<i>"Union des Femmes Françaises"</i>

1384
01:56:42.446 --> 01:56:43.872
Union of French Women.

1385
01:56:44.256 --> 01:56:46.008
<i>"We are for the Viets."</i>

1386
01:56:46.091 --> 01:56:47.342
Traitors!

1387
01:56:47.801 --> 01:56:49.928
Communist traitors, at home!

1388
01:56:51.446 --> 01:56:53.870
Dien Bien Phu? Okay.

1389
01:56:54.394 --> 01:56:56.609
The French is shit.

1390
01:56:58.036 --> 01:57:00.288
No <i>one</i> cares. No <i>one</i> wants to—

1391
01:57:00.312 --> 01:57:02.112
 You are bothering me, LaFavre!

1392
01:57:02.958 --> 01:57:05.961
Why don't you Americans learn from us?
From our mistakes?

1393
01:57:07.154 --> 01:57:09.194
Mon Dieu, with your Army, your strength,
your power,

1394
01:57:09.239 --> 01:57:10.542
you can win, if you want to!

1395
01:57:10.966 --> 01:57:13.066
Be kind and help this 
poor LaFavre who fell, please.

1396
01:57:13.593 --> 01:57:14.811
You can win.

1397
01:57:18.323 --> 01:57:21.535
But, we know, I'm <i>sure</i>
we can make something, there...

1398
01:57:22.185 --> 01:57:23.770
I'm <i>sure</i> about it, you know?

1399
01:57:24.212 --> 01:57:26.757
I never do something
wrong to the people, here.

1400
01:57:27.441 --> 01:57:30.121
I'm sorry, you know, but the Communists
at home have never been traitors.

1401
01:57:30.185 --> 01:57:31.985
No, never traitors.

1402
01:57:32.009 --> 01:57:34.009
For me, Mendès-France was a Communist!

1403
01:57:34.033 --> 01:57:35.233
Mendès-France was a Socialist.

1404
01:57:35.257 --> 01:57:37.157
He was a Communist!
For me, it's simple!

1405
01:57:37.181 --> 01:57:37.881
Socialist.

1406
01:57:37.905 --> 01:57:40.805
How do you want the government to
win when it is Communist?

1407
01:57:40.829 --> 01:57:42.829
Communists have always worked for
peace wherever they are.

1408
01:57:42.853 --> 01:57:46.953
They killed the French Army,
which was the strongest in the world!

1409
01:57:46.977 --> 01:57:48.277
Because of who?
The Communists.

1410
01:57:48.301 --> 01:57:51.501
The Army destroyed itself by its
attitude toward the people here.

1411
01:57:51.525 --> 01:57:53.525
And why do you think that it did that?

1412
01:57:53.549 --> 01:57:56.449
Because it understood it had been 
sacrificed by government Communists!

1413
01:57:56.473 --> 01:57:57.273
Socialists!

1414
01:57:57.297 --> 01:57:58.097
They were Communists!

1415
01:57:58.121 --> 01:57:58.621
Socialists!

1416
01:57:58.645 --> 01:57:59.245
Shut up.

1417
01:57:59.469 --> 01:58:00.269
Yeah...

1418
01:58:00.893 --> 01:58:01.993
Goodnight, sir.

1419
01:58:05.011 --> 01:58:07.998
Excuse me. I have to go.
Captain, good night.

1420
01:58:08.482 --> 01:58:11.067
- He was a Socialist, you know?
- I know we can stay.

1421
01:58:11.151 --> 01:58:15.104
I know that we can stay and 
make practitioners. We can stay.

1422
01:58:15.428 --> 01:58:17.428
- Please show uncle to bed.
- Good evening, everyone.

1423
01:58:17.966 --> 01:58:20.272
- You know, we- we- we always
- Come on, we are leaving.

1424
01:58:20.296 --> 01:58:21.344
- <i>help</i> the people.
- Come. Let's go.ㅤ

1425
01:58:21.428 --> 01:58:23.597
- We <i>work</i> with the people.
- Yes, yes, we know...

1426
01:58:24.121 --> 01:58:26.521
So we can be friends as
soon as we are agreed.

1427
01:58:37.552 --> 01:58:41.223
So when you ask me <i>why</i> we
want to stay here, Captain...

1428
01:58:42.907 --> 01:58:46.870
We want to stay here because it's...<i>ours</i>.
It belongs to <i>us</i>.

1429
01:58:47.579 --> 01:58:49.247
It keeps our family together.

1430
01:58:50.999 --> 01:58:52.601
I mean, we fight for that!

1431
01:58:54.919 --> 01:58:56.713
While you American...

1432
01:58:57.431 --> 01:59:02.810
You are fighting for...
the biggest <i>nothing</i> in history.

1433
01:59:12.434 --> 01:59:13.534
Goodnight, Roxanne.

1434
01:59:36.795 --> 01:59:39.464
I apologize for my family, Captain.

1435
01:59:41.408 --> 01:59:43.535
We have all lost much, here.

1436
01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:48.139
Hubert, his wife and two sons.

1437
01:59:52.686 --> 01:59:54.854
And I have lost a husband.

1438
02:00:00.643 --> 02:00:02.100
I understand.

1439
02:00:02.524 --> 02:00:04.539
You are tired of the war.

1440
02:00:06.724 --> 02:00:08.851
I can see on your face.

1441
02:00:11.379 --> 02:00:15.008
It was the same in the eyes
of the soldiers of our war.

1442
02:00:17.118 --> 02:00:19.620
We call them
<i>"Les Soldats Perdus."</i>

1443
02:00:20.888 --> 02:00:22.682
The Lost Soldiers.

1444
02:00:27.662 --> 02:00:30.006
If you like, we can have some cognac.

1445
02:00:37.104 --> 02:00:40.066
I'll see about my men and...

1446
02:00:47.665 --> 02:00:50.251
The war will be still here, tomorrow.

1447
02:01:01.012 --> 02:01:02.356
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1448
02:01:11.264 --> 02:01:13.833
I noticed you had no wine at dinner.

1449
02:01:14.984 --> 02:01:17.653
No, I um... don't drink wine.

1450
02:01:21.074 --> 02:01:25.378
I do like cognac, but, uh... 
I don't want any now, thank you.

1451
02:01:26.496 --> 02:01:27.705
Well...

1452
02:01:29.207 --> 02:01:31.959
then I—  
I must drink alone.

1453
02:01:42.361 --> 02:01:45.540
Will you go back, after the war?
To America?

1454
02:01:49.864 --> 02:01:50.964
No.

1455
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:54.424
Then you're like us. Your home is here.

1456
02:02:12.225 --> 02:02:15.845
Do you know why you can never
step into the same river twice?

1457
02:02:22.885 --> 02:02:26.013
I used to prepare a pipe for my husband.

1458
02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:37.608
It was the morphine he took
for the wounds he suffered in his heart.

1459
02:02:41.279 --> 02:02:44.907
He would rage and he would cry,
my Lost Soldier.

1460
02:02:48.661 --> 02:02:50.329
And I said to him,

1461
02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:54.758
<i>"there are two of you, don't you see?</i>

1462
02:02:55.543 --> 02:02:59.172
<i>"One that kills and one that loves."</i>

1463
02:03:01.299 --> 02:03:02.967
And he said to me,

1464
02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:07.471
<i>"I don't know whether
I am an animal or a God."</i>

1465
02:03:11.033 --> 02:03:12.360
But you are both.

1466
02:03:54.735 --> 02:03:56.187
You want more?

1467
02:04:02.001 --> 02:04:05.330
All that matters is that you are alive.

1468
02:04:07.406 --> 02:04:09.325
You are alive, Captain.

1469
02:04:13.721 --> 02:04:15.348
That's the truth.

1470
02:05:29.255 --> 02:05:32.758
There are two of you, don't you see?

1471
02:05:33.993 --> 02:05:35.494
One that kills...

1472
02:05:36.787 --> 02:05:38.205
and one that loves.

1473
02:06:07.426 --> 02:06:09.971
Can't see nothin'. We're stoppin'.

1474
02:06:10.671 --> 02:06:12.848
You're not authorized 
to stop this boat, Chief.

1475
02:06:13.132 --> 02:06:16.235
I said I can't see a thing,
Captain. I'm stoppin' this boat.

1476
02:06:16.619 --> 02:06:18.104
I ain't riskin' no more lives.

1477
02:06:18.287 --> 02:06:20.807
I'm in command here, Goddammit. 
You'll do what I say.

1478
02:06:23.290 --> 02:06:24.944
You see anythin', Chef?

1479
02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:29.991
Why don't they fuckin' attack, man?!

1480
02:06:49.110 --> 02:06:50.437
Watch it over here, Chief!

1481
02:06:52.363 --> 02:06:53.656
Got a stump.

1482
02:06:55.933 --> 02:06:57.435
Lance, on the .50...

1483
02:06:58.619 --> 02:07:00.413
<i>He was close.</i>

1484
02:07:02.356 --> 02:07:04.025
<i>He was real close.</i>

1485
02:07:06.319 --> 02:07:08.612
<i>I couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him.</i>

1486
02:07:09.238 --> 02:07:11.198
<i>As if the boat were being sucked upriver,</i>

1487
02:07:11.282 --> 02:07:14.160
<i>and the water was
flowing back into the jungle.</i>

1488
02:07:16.804 --> 02:07:19.223
<i>Whatever was going to happen,</i>

1489
02:07:19.306 --> 02:07:23.269
<i>it wasn't gonna be the way
they called it back in Nha Trang.</i>

1490
02:07:27.856 --> 02:07:29.300
Arrows!

1491
02:07:29.383 --> 02:07:30.384
Fire!

1492
02:07:32.753 --> 02:07:34.755
Chef, open up! Fire!

1493
02:07:39.093 --> 02:07:40.853
Lance, fire!

1494
02:07:48.852 --> 02:07:53.899
Chef! Chef, it's okay! Quit firing!
They're just little toy arrows!

1495
02:07:54.467 --> 02:07:56.352
Cut it out! Quiet!

1496
02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:59.121
Chief, tell them to hold their fire!

1497
02:07:59.205 --> 02:08:02.124
They're just little sticks!
They're just tryin' to scare us!

1498
02:08:02.108 --> 02:08:03.192
Quiet!

1499
02:08:04.535 --> 02:08:07.129
You got us in this mess,
and now, you can't get us out

1500
02:08:07.213 --> 02:08:09.533
because you don't know 
the hell you goin', do ya?!

1501
02:08:09.815 --> 02:08:10.983
Do ya?!

1502
02:08:11.984 --> 02:08:14.862
You son of a bitch! You bastard!

1503
02:08:16.489 --> 02:08:18.824
- Lance, get the wheel!
- Fire! Fire! Fire!

1504
02:08:19.292 --> 02:08:22.837
You savages!
Come and get it, you son of a bitches!

1505
02:08:43.516 --> 02:08:45.184
A spear...

1506
02:10:04.738 --> 02:10:07.374
My mission is to 
make it up into Cambodia.

1507
02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:10.461
There's a Green Beret Colonel 
up there who's gone insane,

1508
02:10:10.544 --> 02:10:12.546
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1509
02:10:13.839 --> 02:10:16.800
That's fuckin' typical! Shit!

1510
02:10:16.884 --> 02:10:19.094
Fuckin' Vietnam mission!

1511
02:10:19.278 --> 02:10:22.932
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?!

1512
02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:26.936
That's fuckin' great!
That's just fuckin' great, man!

1513
02:10:27.603 --> 02:10:30.981
Shit! That's fuckin' crazy!

1514
02:10:31.165 --> 02:10:34.068
I mean, I thought you were
goin' in to blow up a bridge

1515
02:10:34.151 --> 02:10:37.029
or some fuckin'
railroad tracks or something!

1516
02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:39.874
- Sorry.
- No, no, wait, wait!

1517
02:10:39.957 --> 02:10:43.252
Wait, we'll go together! On the boat!
We'll go with you!

1518
02:10:43.636 --> 02:10:47.306
We'll go up there, but on the boat! Okay?

1519
02:11:54.273 --> 02:11:56.209
<i>Part of me was
afraid of what I would find</i>

1520
02:11:56.233 --> 02:11:58.235
<i>and what I would do when I got there.</i>

1521
02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:02.656
<i>I knew the risks,</i>

1522
02:12:04.158 --> 02:12:05.659
<i>or imagined I knew.</i>

1523
02:12:08.287 --> 02:12:12.458
<i>But the thing I felt the most,
much stronger than fear,</i>

1524
02:12:14.084 --> 02:12:16.003
<i>was the desire to confront him.</i>

1525
02:13:28.801 --> 02:13:30.093
Just keep movin'.

1526
02:13:30.803 --> 02:13:34.473
Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.

1527
02:15:01.293 --> 02:15:04.463
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

1528
02:15:05.731 --> 02:15:08.984
I ain't comin' in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1529
02:15:10.402 --> 02:15:13.655
Zap 'em with your siren, man!
Zap 'em with your siren!

1530
02:15:23.882 --> 02:15:25.860
There's mines over there
and mines over there, too!

1531
02:15:25.884 --> 02:15:28.345
And watch out! Those Goddamn
monkeys bite you, I'll tell you!

1532
02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:31.724
Ah. That's a pretty one.
Move it right in, toward me.

1533
02:15:33.342 --> 02:15:37.220
I'm an American! Yeah!
An American civilian. Hi, Yanks.

1534
02:15:37.930 --> 02:15:39.431
Hi, American.

1535
02:15:39.932 --> 02:15:41.350
American civilian. It's all right.

1536
02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:45.120
And you got the cigarettes.
And that's what I've been dreamin' about.

1537
02:15:46.188 --> 02:15:47.272
Chef.

1538
02:15:47.923 --> 02:15:50.592
- Who are you?
- Mm... who are you?

1539
02:15:54.888 --> 02:15:56.515
I'm a photojournalist.

1540
02:15:57.182 --> 02:16:02.104
I've covered the war since '64.
I've been in Laos, Cambodia and 'nam.

1541
02:16:06.975 --> 02:16:09.728
I'll tell you one thing,
this boat is a mess, man.

1542
02:16:10.529 --> 02:16:11.864
Who are all these people?

1543
02:16:11.947 --> 02:16:14.491
Yeah, well— 
they think you've come to, uh...

1544
02:16:16.034 --> 02:16:17.086
to take him away...

1545
02:16:17.185 --> 02:16:20.163
- And I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?

1546
02:16:22.541 --> 02:16:23.625
Him!

1547
02:16:24.351 --> 02:16:25.460
Colonel Kurtz.

1548
02:16:26.336 --> 02:16:29.047
These are all his children, man,
as far as you can see.

1549
02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:32.843
Hell, man, out here,
we're all his children.

1550
02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:35.070
Could we, uh...

1551
02:16:36.071 --> 02:16:37.239
talk to Colonel Kurtz?

1552
02:16:37.623 --> 02:16:40.375
Hey, man, you don't—
Uh, you don't talk to the Colonel.

1553
02:16:41.994 --> 02:16:43.612
Well, will you listen to him?

1554
02:16:44.897 --> 02:16:50.711
The man's enlarged my mind.
Uh, he's a poet warrior in the classic sense.

1555
02:16:51.036 --> 02:16:54.248
I mean, sometimes, he'll, uh—
Well, you'll say "hello" to him, right?

1556
02:16:54.331 --> 02:16:56.768
and, uh, he'll just walk right by
you and he won't even notice you.

1557
02:16:56.892 --> 02:17:00.495
And then, su-suddenly he'll grab you,
he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say,

1558
02:17:00.579 --> 02:17:03.665
<i>"do you know that 'if' is the middle
word in 'life'? If you can keep your head</i>

1559
02:17:03.749 --> 02:17:05.602
<i>"when all about you are losing
theirs and blaming it on you,</i>

1560
02:17:05.626 --> 02:17:07.006
<i>"if you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you—"</i>

1561
02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:08.154
I mean, I'm no—
I- I can't—

1562
02:17:08.378 --> 02:17:11.590
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's... he's a great man.

1563
02:17:11.591 --> 02:17:12.557
Uh, uh—

1564
02:17:12.582 --> 02:17:15.043
<i>"I should have been a pair of ragged claws</i>

1565
02:17:15.327 --> 02:17:18.238
<i>scuttling across
the floors of silent seas,"</i> I mean...

1566
02:17:18.321 --> 02:17:19.499
Stay with the boat.

1567
02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:20.557
Hey, don't go anywh—

1568
02:17:20.582 --> 02:17:23.460
Hey, don't go without me, okay?
I wanna get a picture.

1569
02:17:26.204 --> 02:17:30.876
He can be terrible, and he can be mean,
and he can be right.

1570
02:17:31.777 --> 02:17:34.613
He's fighting the war. He's a great man.

1571
02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:39.084
I mean...

1572
02:17:42.804 --> 02:17:46.349
I wish I had words, you know?
I wish I had words...

1573
02:17:46.433 --> 02:17:49.073
I can tell you something, like,
the other day, uh, he wanted to kill me.

1574
02:17:49.603 --> 02:17:51.813
- Somethin' like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?

1575
02:17:52.414 --> 02:17:53.999
Because I took his picture.

1576
02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:57.094
He said, <i>“if you take my picture again,</i>

1577
02:17:58.570 --> 02:17:59.905
<i>"I'm gonna kill you,"</i>

1578
02:18:01.014 --> 02:18:02.349
and he meant it.

1579
02:18:04.951 --> 02:18:08.914
So you just lay cool.
Play it cool, laid back. Dig it.

1580
02:18:09.439 --> 02:18:11.149
He gets friendly, again. He really does.

1581
02:18:12.776 --> 02:18:15.153
But, uh, you don't— you don't, uh—
you don't judge the Colonel.

1582
02:18:16.171 --> 02:18:18.298
You don't judge the
Colonel like an ordinary man.

1583
02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.542
Okay, watch it, now.
These are Americans. Americans!

1584
02:18:28.625 --> 02:18:30.127
You can feel the vibe of this place.

1585
02:18:31.128 --> 02:18:32.334
Let me take your picture.

1586
02:18:32.658 --> 02:18:34.489
Hey, could you hol—
Hey, hello? Hello?

1587
02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:36.174
Could you hold up a minute?

1588
02:18:58.630 --> 02:18:59.798
Colby.

1589
02:19:16.273 --> 02:19:17.863
The heads...

1590
02:19:18.387 --> 02:19:20.052
You're lookin' at... the heads...

1591
02:19:20.176 --> 02:19:21.976
I, uh...

1592
02:19:22.112 --> 02:19:24.406
Sometimes, he goes too far,
and you know...

1593
02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:26.324
He's the first one to admit it.

1594
02:19:27.350 --> 02:19:29.603
- He's gone crazy...
- Wrong, wrong!

1595
02:19:31.663 --> 02:19:34.424
If you could have heard
the man, uh... just two days ago.

1596
02:19:34.608 --> 02:19:37.194
If you could have heard him, then, God...

1597
02:19:37.277 --> 02:19:39.154
You're gonna call him crazy?

1598
02:19:39.838 --> 02:19:40.614
Fuckin'-A...

1599
02:19:41.715 --> 02:19:42.549
It's—

1600
02:19:42.574 --> 02:19:43.992
I just wanna talk to him.

1601
02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:48.013
Well, man, he's gone away.

1602
02:19:49.831 --> 02:19:52.310
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1603
02:19:52.334 --> 02:19:55.087
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.

1604
02:19:56.004 --> 02:19:58.048
He forgets himself with his people.

1605
02:20:00.008 --> 02:20:02.844
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?

1606
02:20:02.928 --> 02:20:04.596
Maybe we should wait back at the boat.

1607
02:20:05.889 --> 02:20:07.265
- I think you—
- Okay, Chef.

1608
02:20:07.866 --> 02:20:12.287
- We'll go back to the boat for a while.
- Yeah, stay with Lance.

1609
02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:40.298
This Colonel guy, he- he's wacko, man.
He's worse than crazy. He's evil!

1610
02:20:41.233 --> 02:20:43.360
I mean, that's what the man's
got set up, here, man!

1611
02:20:43.443 --> 02:20:45.979
It's fuckin' pagan idolatry!
Look around you!

1612
02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:49.891
- Shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?

1613
02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:53.788
"Help you?" Fuckin'-A, I'll help you.
I'll do anything to get outta this joint!

1614
02:20:53.812 --> 02:20:54.938
Good boy.

1615
02:20:55.522 --> 02:20:57.041
We could blow
all them assholes away.

1616
02:20:57.065 --> 02:20:59.693
They're so fuckin' spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it!

1617
02:21:00.610 --> 02:21:05.115
Oh, I ain't afraid of all them
fuckin' skulls, and altars, and shit.

1618
02:21:07.242 --> 02:21:08.657
I used to think if...

1619
02:21:09.181 --> 02:21:11.371
If I died in an evil place,

1620
02:21:11.413 --> 02:21:13.498
then my soul wouldn't be
able to make it to heaven.

1621
02:21:14.557 --> 02:21:17.519
But, now? Fuck.

1622
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:21.723
I mean, I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1623
02:21:22.707 --> 02:21:25.343
So what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.

1624
02:21:25.427 --> 02:21:27.220
- No, no.
- Get outta here.

1625
02:21:27.304 --> 02:21:28.930
I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1626
02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:33.326
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around,
check the place out,

1627
02:21:33.852 --> 02:21:36.021
see if I can find the Colonel, okay?

1628
02:21:37.622 --> 02:21:41.001
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Damn it.

1629
02:21:40.984 --> 02:21:46.990
Here, you take the radio,
and if I don't get back by 2200 hours,

1630
02:21:49.868 --> 02:21:51.203
you call in the air strike.

1631
02:21:53.897 --> 02:21:55.273
Air strike?

1632
02:21:57.225 --> 02:22:01.896
The code is "Almighty,"
coordinates 0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1633
02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:04.249
It's all in there.

1634
02:22:05.717 --> 02:22:08.445
0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1635
02:22:17.229 --> 02:22:20.565
<i>Everything I saw told
me that Kurtz had gone insane.</i>

1636
02:22:24.945 --> 02:22:30.617
<i>The place was full of bodies.
North Vietnamese, Viet Cong, Cambodians.</i>

1637
02:22:38.391 --> 02:22:41.394
<i>If I was still alive,
it was because he wanted me that way.</i>

1638
02:22:51.738 --> 02:22:52.439
Hey!

1639
02:23:15.745 --> 02:23:18.164
<i>It smelled like slow death in there.</i>

1640
02:23:19.749 --> 02:23:23.003
<i>Malaria, nightmares.</i>

1641
02:23:25.797 --> 02:23:28.091
<i>This was the end of the river, all right.</i>

1642
02:23:42.047 --> 02:23:43.487
Where are you from, Willard?

1643
02:23:49.154 --> 02:23:50.739
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1644
02:23:56.703 --> 02:23:59.331
- Were you born there?
- Yes, sir.

1645
02:24:01.499 --> 02:24:04.627
- Whereabouts?
- Toledo, sir.

1646
02:24:11.609 --> 02:24:13.403
How far are you from the river?

1647
02:24:20.268 --> 02:24:21.978
The Ohio river, sir?

1648
02:24:23.229 --> 02:24:26.191
- Uh-huh.
- About 200 miles.

1649
02:24:34.199 --> 02:24:37.160
I went down that river
once when I was a kid.

1650
02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:45.143
There's a place in the river,
I can't remember...

1651
02:24:45.226 --> 02:24:50.398
It must've been a gardenia plantation,
or a flower plantation, at one time.

1652
02:24:50.482 --> 02:24:53.734
It's all wild and overgrown now, but...

1653
02:24:53.918 --> 02:25:00.424
for about... for about five miles, you'd
think that heaven just fell on the earth,

1654
02:25:01.042 --> 02:25:03.003
in the form of gardenias.

1655
02:25:19.411 --> 02:25:24.457
Have you ever considered...
any real freedoms?

1656
02:25:30.355 --> 02:25:33.274
Freedoms from the opinion of others?

1657
02:25:36.819 --> 02:25:38.780
Even the opinions of yourself?

1658
02:25:54.863 --> 02:25:58.450
Did they say why, Willard?

1659
02:26:00.602 --> 02:26:05.315
Why they wanted to terminate my command?

1660
02:26:21.055 --> 02:26:23.266
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.

1661
02:26:27.279 --> 02:26:28.947
No longer classified,

1662
02:26:30.498 --> 02:26:31.749
is it?

1663
02:26:38.123 --> 02:26:39.541
What did they tell you?

1664
02:26:42.744 --> 02:26:44.287
They told me...

1665
02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:46.639
that you had gone...

1666
02:26:47.932 --> 02:26:49.225
totally insane,

1667
02:26:52.003 --> 02:26:56.466
and, uh, that your... methods were...

1668
02:26:57.625 --> 02:26:58.835
unsound.

1669
02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:04.098
Are my methods unsound?

1670
02:27:10.188 --> 02:27:16.361
I don't see any method at all, sir.

1671
02:27:23.451 --> 02:27:27.080
I expected... someone like you...

1672
02:27:30.358 --> 02:27:31.609
What did you expect?

1673
02:27:39.968 --> 02:27:41.553
Are you an assassin?

1674
02:27:46.632 --> 02:27:47.800
I'm a Soldier.

1675
02:27:51.479 --> 02:27:53.064
You're neither.

1676
02:27:55.233 --> 02:27:56.734
You're an errand boy...

1677
02:27:58.403 --> 02:28:00.338
sent by grocery clerks...

1678
02:28:04.376 --> 02:28:06.044
to collect a bill.

1679
02:28:50.304 --> 02:28:55.935
Why, huh? Why would a nice guy
like you wanna kill a genius?

1680
02:29:02.875 --> 02:29:04.627
Goin' down pretty good, huh?

1681
02:29:05.378 --> 02:29:06.462
Why?

1682
02:29:08.272 --> 02:29:09.941
You know?

1683
02:29:10.533 --> 02:29:12.577
Do you know that the man,

1684
02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:17.982
the man really likes you?

1685
02:29:21.377 --> 02:29:23.888
He likes you. He really likes you, but...

1686
02:29:25.898 --> 02:29:27.775
he's got something in mind for you.

1687
02:29:28.659 --> 02:29:30.511
Aren't you curious about that?

1688
02:29:31.095 --> 02:29:34.515
I'm curious. I'm very curious.

1689
02:29:35.850 --> 02:29:36.776
Are you curious?

1690
02:29:39.962 --> 02:29:42.757
There's something happenin' out here, man.

1691
02:29:46.177 --> 02:29:48.697
You know something, man?
I know something that you don't know.

1692
02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:50.907
That's right, Jack.

1693
02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:53.284
The man is clear in his mind,

1694
02:29:54.602 --> 02:29:56.020
but his soul is mad.

1695
02:29:58.231 --> 02:29:59.524
Oh, yeah.

1696
02:30:00.750 --> 02:30:04.754
He's dying, I think.
He hates all this. He hates it.

1697
02:30:06.038 --> 02:30:09.917
But... the man's, uh...

1698
02:30:13.221 --> 02:30:15.723
He reads poetry out loud, all right?

1699
02:30:17.542 --> 02:30:18.710
And a voice,

1700
02:30:20.686 --> 02:30:21.938
a voice...

1701
02:30:24.549 --> 02:30:26.442
He likes you 'cause you're still alive.

1702
02:30:27.610 --> 02:30:29.120
He's got plans for you.

1703
02:30:29.303 --> 02:30:33.933
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.
You're gonna help him, man.

1704
02:30:34.992 --> 02:30:36.344
You're gonna help him.

1705
02:30:36.728 --> 02:30:39.188
I mean, what are they gonna say, man,
when he's gone? Huh?

1706
02:30:39.272 --> 02:30:43.943
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1707
02:30:44.026 --> 02:30:46.171
What are they gonna say about him?
What are they gonna say?

1708
02:30:46.195 --> 02:30:49.782
<i>"He was a kind man. He was a wise man.</i>

1709
02:30:49.866 --> 02:30:53.461
<i>"He had plans. He had wisdom.“</i>
Bullshit, man!

1710
02:30:53.545 --> 02:30:57.990
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1711
02:31:01.686 --> 02:31:02.770
You...

1712
02:31:07.809 --> 02:31:09.727
Almost eight hours...

1713
02:31:12.572 --> 02:31:16.033
God. I'm asleep.

1714
02:31:18.052 --> 02:31:20.805
I'm asleep and I'm dreamin'
I'm on this shitty boat.

1715
02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:33.985
Fuck.

1716
02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:39.607
<i>Has it been eight hours?</i>

1717
02:31:42.594 --> 02:31:47.265
Hello, Almighty, Almighty.
This is PBR Street Gang.

1718
02:31:47.765 --> 02:31:48.766
Radio check. Over.

1719
02:31:49.934 --> 02:31:52.604
<i>PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty standing by. Over.</i>

1720
02:33:16.487 --> 02:33:18.848
What the hell! Jesus!

1721
02:33:25.655 --> 02:33:27.407
Oh, Christ!

1722
02:35:54.637 --> 02:35:58.808
<i>"We are the hollow men
we are the stuffed men</i>

1723
02:35:59.517 --> 02:36:04.939
<i>"leaning together
headpiece filled with straw. Alas!</i>

1724
02:36:06.482 --> 02:36:09.026
<i>"Our dried voices,

1725
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:12.446
<i>"are quiet and
meaningless as wind in dry grass</i>

1726
02:36:13.489 --> 02:36:16.093
- <i>"or rats' feet over broken glass..."</i>
- Oh, he's out there.

1727
02:36:16.117 --> 02:36:17.618
<i>"In our dry cellar..."</i>

1728
02:36:18.244 --> 02:36:24.166
- He's really out there.
- <i>"Shape without form, shade without color,</i>

1729
02:36:25.501 --> 02:36:30.214
<i>"paralyzed force,
gesture without motion..."</i>

1730
02:36:30.298 --> 02:36:32.338
Do you know what the man's saying?

1731
02:36:33.175 --> 02:36:34.886
- Do you?
- <i>"Those who have crossed..."</i>

1732
02:36:35.511 --> 02:36:39.765
This is dialectics. It's very
simple dialectics. One through nine,

1733
02:36:39.849 --> 02:36:43.227
no <i>"maybes,"</i> no <i>"supposes,"</i> no fractions.
You can't travel in space.

1734
02:36:43.311 --> 02:36:47.690
You can't go out into space, you know,
without like, you know... with fractions.

1735
02:36:47.773 --> 02:36:49.668
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?

1736
02:36:49.692 --> 02:36:52.445
What are you gonna do when you go
from here to Venus or something?

1737
02:36:52.528 --> 02:36:54.347
That's dialectic physics, okay?

1738
02:36:54.430 --> 02:36:56.416
Dialectic logic is,
<i>"there's only love and hate."</i>

1739
02:36:56.499 --> 02:36:58.543
You either love somebody or you hate 'em.

1740
02:36:59.201 --> 02:37:00.286
Mutt!

1741
02:37:02.622 --> 02:37:03.873
You mutt...

1742
02:37:04.707 --> 02:37:09.712
This is the way the fucking world ends.
Look at this fucking shit we're in, man!

1743
02:37:10.463 --> 02:37:12.465
<i>"Not with a bang, a whimper."</i>

1744
02:37:12.548 --> 02:37:14.884
And with a whimper, I'm fucking splitting,
Jack.

1745
02:37:44.705 --> 02:37:47.458
<i>On the river, I thought
that the minute I looked at him,</i>

1746
02:37:47.541 --> 02:37:49.293
<i>I'd know what to do.</i>

1747
02:37:50.252 --> 02:37:51.504
<i>But it didn't happen.</i>

1748
02:37:53.464 --> 02:37:56.968
<i>I was in there with him for days,
not under guard.</i>

1749
02:37:57.927 --> 02:37:59.136
<i>I was free.</i>

1750
02:38:00.054 --> 02:38:02.306
<i>But he knew I wasn't going anywhere.</i>

1751
02:38:03.557 --> 02:38:06.852
<i>He knew more about what I was
going to do than I did.</i>

1752
02:38:13.943 --> 02:38:17.446
<i>If the Generals back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw,</i>

1753
02:38:18.406 --> 02:38:20.992
<i>would they still want me to kill him?</i>

1754
02:38:22.243 --> 02:38:24.120
<i>More than ever, probably.</i>

1755
02:38:25.579 --> 02:38:27.498
<i>And what would his people back home want,</i>

1756
02:38:27.581 --> 02:38:30.626
<i>if they ever learned just how
far from them he'd really gone?</i>

1757
02:38:33.212 --> 02:38:36.632
<i>He broke from them,
and then he broke from himself.</i>

1758
02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:42.471
<i>I'd never seen a man
so broken up and ripped apart.</i>

1759
02:38:43.472 --> 02:38:47.601
I've seen the horrors,
horrors that you've seen.

1760
02:38:50.271 --> 02:38:52.314
But you have no right
to call me a murderer.

1761
02:38:52.398 --> 02:38:54.191
You have a right to kill me.

1762
02:38:55.526 --> 02:38:57.862
You have a right to do that.

1763
02:38:59.655 --> 02:39:01.657
But you have no right to judge me.

1764
02:39:08.831 --> 02:39:13.836
It's impossible for words to describe...

1765
02:39:16.172 --> 02:39:19.341
what is necessary...

1766
02:39:21.343 --> 02:39:25.347
to those who do not know

1767
02:39:26.682 --> 02:39:29.643
what "horror" means.

1768
02:39:31.979 --> 02:39:33.189
Horror.

1769
02:39:36.192 --> 02:39:38.819
Horror has a face.

1770
02:39:41.113 --> 02:39:43.240
And you must make a friend of horror.

1771
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:49.789
Horror and moral terror are your friends.

1772
02:39:50.372 --> 02:39:55.169
If they are not,
then they are enemies to be feared.

1773
02:39:56.670 --> 02:39:58.547
They are truly enemies.

1774
02:40:03.552 --> 02:40:06.388
I remember when I was with Special Forces.

1775
02:40:10.893 --> 02:40:14.814
It seems a thousand centuries ago.

1776
02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:20.599
We went into a camp
to inoculate...

1777
02:40:23.123 --> 02:40:24.940
some children.

1778
02:40:28.828 --> 02:40:34.375
We'd left the camp, after we had
inoculated the children for polio.

1779
02:40:36.836 --> 02:40:40.214
And this old man came running after us,
and he was crying, he couldn't see.

1780
02:40:43.801 --> 02:40:45.469
We went back there

1781
02:40:46.428 --> 02:40:51.892
and they had come
and hacked off every inoculated arm.

1782
02:40:54.270 --> 02:40:57.690
There they were, in a pile. A pile of...

1783
02:40:59.859 --> 02:41:01.110
little arms.

1784
02:41:03.195 --> 02:41:05.447
And I remember,

1785
02:41:09.326 --> 02:41:12.121
I cried. I wept like...

1786
02:41:14.290 --> 02:41:16.959
some grandmother.

1787
02:41:19.128 --> 02:41:22.381
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

1788
02:41:24.133 --> 02:41:26.385
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

1789
02:41:27.261 --> 02:41:29.096
I never want to forget.

1790
02:41:30.764 --> 02:41:32.349
And then I realized,

1791
02:41:33.809 --> 02:41:38.147
like I was shot,
like I was shot with a diamond,

1792
02:41:39.356 --> 02:41:42.484
a diamond bullet,
right through my forehead.

1793
02:41:44.570 --> 02:41:49.742
And I thought, <i>"my God,
the genius of that. The genius."</i>

1794
02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:53.537
The will to do that,

1795
02:41:55.206 --> 02:41:59.668
perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline,
pure.

1796
02:42:02.254 --> 02:42:04.173
And then I realized,

1797
02:42:04.256 --> 02:42:07.843
they were stronger than me,
because they could stand it.

1798
02:42:07.927 --> 02:42:11.889
These were not monsters.
These were men, trained cadres.

1799
02:42:13.349 --> 02:42:15.935
These men who fought with their hearts,

1800
02:42:16.018 --> 02:42:19.396
who have families, who have children,
who are filled with love,

1801
02:42:20.397 --> 02:42:22.149
but they have the strength,

1802
02:42:23.692 --> 02:42:25.194
the strength...

1803
02:42:29.156 --> 02:42:30.366
to do that.

1804
02:42:31.242 --> 02:42:35.537
If I had ten divisions of those men,

1805
02:42:36.622 --> 02:42:39.583
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

1806
02:42:41.377 --> 02:42:45.798
You have to have men who are moral,

1807
02:42:48.133 --> 02:42:51.929
and at the same time, who are able to...

1808
02:42:53.806 --> 02:42:55.754
utilize their...

1809
02:42:57.978 --> 02:43:01.962
primordial instincts to kill...

1810
02:43:01.981 --> 02:43:03.941
without feeling, without passion,

1811
02:43:06.026 --> 02:43:08.529
without judgment. Without judgment.

1812
02:43:14.076 --> 02:43:16.704
Because it's judgment that defeats us.

1813
02:43:36.181 --> 02:43:42.980
I worry that my son might not
understand what I've tried to be.

1814
02:43:45.691 --> 02:43:50.321
And if I were to be killed, Willard,

1815
02:43:51.864 --> 02:43:57.328
I would want someone to go to my
home and tell my son everything.

1816
02:44:00.622 --> 02:44:03.584
<i>Everything I did. Everything you saw.</i>

1817
02:44:05.377 --> 02:44:10.883
<i>Because there's nothing that I detest
more than the stench of lies.</i>

1818
02:44:13.969 --> 02:44:16.468
<i>And if you understand
me, Willard, you...</i>

1819
02:44:18.992 --> 02:44:21.476
<i>You will do this for me.</i>

1820
02:45:27.501 --> 02:45:29.670
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Over.</i>

1821
02:45:31.463 --> 02:45:34.591
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. Over.</i>

1822
02:45:36.844 --> 02:45:40.722
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. How do you copy?</i>

1823
02:45:46.061 --> 02:45:48.856
<i>They were gonna
make me a Major for this,</i>

1824
02:45:49.606 --> 02:45:52.734
<i>and I wasn't even
in their fucking Army, anymore.</i>

1825
02:45:54.903 --> 02:45:56.864
<i>Everybody wanted me to do it,</i>

1826
02:45:58.490 --> 02:45:59.908
<i>him most of all.</i>

1827
02:46:01.577 --> 02:46:05.956
<i>I felt like he was up there,
waiting for me to take the pain away.</i>

1828
02:46:09.293 --> 02:46:11.670
<i>He just wanted to go out like a Soldier.</i>

1829
02:46:12.504 --> 02:46:13.672
<i>Standing up.</i>

1830
02:46:14.715 --> 02:46:18.302
<i>Not like some poor, wasted,
rag-assed renegade.</i>

1831
02:46:22.181 --> 02:46:24.475
<i>Even the jungle wanted him dead,</i>

1832
02:46:25.434 --> 02:46:28.103
<i>and that's who he really
took his orders from anyway.</i>

1833
02:47:45.430 --> 02:47:50.644
"We train young men to drop fire
on people, but their commanders

1834
02:47:51.853 --> 02:47:56.775
"won't allow them to write 'fuck!'
On their airplanes

1835
02:47:56.858 --> 02:47:59.861
"because it's obscene!"

1836
02:49:23.070 --> 02:49:24.613
The horror...

1837
02:49:28.659 --> 02:49:30.035
The horror...

1838
02:54:26.581 --> 02:54:28.458
<i>Calling PBR Street Gang.</i>

1839
02:54:29.626 --> 02:54:33.588
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Do you read me? Over.</i>

1840
02:54:34.464 --> 02:54:36.049
<i>PBR Street Gang.</i>

1841
02:54:36.675 --> 02:54:38.677
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty—</i>

1842
02:55:17.007 --> 02:55:18.425
<i>The horror.</i>

1843
02:55:22.846 --> 02:55:24.222
<i>The horror.</i>
