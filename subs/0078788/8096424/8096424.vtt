1
00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:21.975
Saigon.

2
00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:24.978
Shit.

3
00:04:26.813 --> 00:04:28.774
I'm still only in Saigon.

4
00:04:37.324 --> 00:04:40.827
Every time, I think
I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle.

5
00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:50.587
When I was home after my first tour,
it was worse.

6
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.473
I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.

7
00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:13.610
I hardly said a word to my wife
until I said yes to a divorce.

8
00:05:16.696 --> 00:05:19.282
When I was here, I wanted to be there.

9
00:05:20.242 --> 00:05:25.080
When I was there, all I could think
of was getting back into the jungle.

10
00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:30.335
I'm here a week now.

11
00:05:33.922 --> 00:05:35.882
Waiting for a mission.

12
00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:38.510
Getting softer.

13
00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:47.018
Every minute I stay in this room,
I get weaker.

14
00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:49.563
And every minute
Charlie squats in the bush,

15
00:05:49.646 --> 00:05:51.273
he gets stronger.

16
00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.240
Each time I looked around,
the walls moved in a little tighter.

17
00:07:40.048 --> 00:07:42.592
Everyone gets everything he wants.

18
00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:45.387
I wanted a mission.

19
00:07:46.346 --> 00:07:48.723
And for my sins, they gave me one.

20
00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:51.977
Brought it up to me like room service.

21
00:07:53.603 --> 00:07:55.981
Captain Willard, are you in there?

22
00:07:56.606 --> 00:07:58.316
Yeah, I'm coming.

23
00:07:58.775 --> 00:08:01.111
It was a real choice mission.

24
00:08:01.903 --> 00:08:05.657
And when it was over,
I'd never want another.

25
00:08:14.374 --> 00:08:16.918
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?

26
00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:18.920
What does it look like?

27
00:08:28.138 --> 00:08:30.849
- Are you Captain Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.

28
00:08:30.932 --> 00:08:32.517
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.

29
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.478
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, you gonna shut the door?

30
00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:40.692
We have orders
to escort you to the airfield.

31
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.697
- What are the charges?
- Sir?

32
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:46.781
What'd I do?

33
00:08:47.532 --> 00:08:49.075
There's no charges, Captain.

34
00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:53.121
You have orders to report
to COMSEC Intelligence at Nha Trang.

35
00:08:54.456 --> 00:08:56.166
- I see.
- All right?

36
00:08:56.249 --> 00:08:58.752
- Nha Trang for me?
- That's right.

37
00:08:59.794 --> 00:09:02.505
Come on, Captain. You still
have a few hours to get cleaned up.

38
00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:05.341
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?

39
00:09:07.343 --> 00:09:10.096
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

40
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.474
Come on, Captain. Let's take a shower.

41
00:09:12.557 --> 00:09:14.309
- Don't be an ass.
- Get hold of him good.

42
00:09:14.392 --> 00:09:16.603
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.

43
00:09:16.686 --> 00:09:18.730
- In we go.
- Now stand underneath this, Captain.

44
00:09:31.493 --> 00:09:33.578
I was going
to the worst place in the world

45
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:35.830
and I didn't even know it yet.

46
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.834
Weeks away
and hundreds of miles up a river

47
00:09:39.918 --> 00:09:42.378
that snaked through the war
like a main circuit cable,

48
00:09:43.046 --> 00:09:45.048
plugged straight into Kurtz.

49
00:09:45.131 --> 00:09:47.842
Insult me again
and I'll kick your ass.

50
00:09:48.468 --> 00:09:50.970
It was no accident
that I got to be the caretaker

51
00:09:51.054 --> 00:09:53.473
of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory

52
00:09:53.932 --> 00:09:57.227
any more than being back
in Saigon was an accident.

53
00:09:58.812 --> 00:10:02.357
There is no way to tell his
story without telling my own.

54
00:10:03.108 --> 00:10:05.110
And if his story is really a confession...

55
00:10:05.193 --> 00:10:06.361
Captain Willard reporting, sir.

56
00:10:06.444 --> 00:10:07.445
...then so is mine.

57
00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:10.990
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

58
00:10:11.074 --> 00:10:14.452
- Stand at ease.
- General.

59
00:10:16.454 --> 00:10:18.832
Do you want a cigarette?

60
00:10:18.915 --> 00:10:20.667
No, thank you, sir.

61
00:10:22.085 --> 00:10:24.712
Captain, have you ever seen
this gentleman before?

62
00:10:24.796 --> 00:10:26.172
No, sir.

63
00:10:26.256 --> 00:10:29.050
- Met the General or myself?
- No, sir.

64
00:10:29.134 --> 00:10:30.385
Not personally.

65
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:33.972
You've worked a lot on your own,
haven't you, Captain?

66
00:10:34.055 --> 00:10:35.473
Yes, sir, I have.

67
00:10:35.557 --> 00:10:36.724
Your report specifies Intelligence,

68
00:10:36.808 --> 00:10:39.227
Counterintelligence with COMSEC, I Corps.

69
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.729
I'm not presently disposed
to discuss those operations, sir.

70
00:10:51.447 --> 00:10:53.408
Did you not work for the CIA in I Corps?

71
00:10:55.869 --> 00:10:56.995
No, sir.

72
00:10:57.078 --> 00:10:59.747
Did you not
assassinate a government tax collector,

73
00:10:59.831 --> 00:11:02.709
Quang Tri Province, June 18, 19687

74
00:11:05.295 --> 00:11:06.588
Captain?

75
00:11:08.173 --> 00:11:12.802
Sir, I am unaware
of any such activity or operation...

76
00:11:13.803 --> 00:11:19.142
nor would I be
disposed to discuss such an operation

77
00:11:19.225 --> 00:11:21.686
if it did, in fact, exist, sir.

78
00:11:33.573 --> 00:11:35.825
I thought we'd have
a bite of lunch while we talk.

79
00:11:35.909 --> 00:11:39.037
I hope you brought a good appetite,
Captain.

80
00:11:39.662 --> 00:11:41.706
I noticed that you have...

81
00:11:43.416 --> 00:11:45.251
a bad hand, there. Are you wounded?

82
00:11:45.335 --> 00:11:47.837
I had a little fishing accident
on R&R, sir.

83
00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:50.798
- Fishing on R&R?
- Yes, sir.

84
00:11:50.882 --> 00:11:53.301
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

85
00:11:53.384 --> 00:11:55.970
Yes, General. Very much so, sir.

86
00:11:56.054 --> 00:11:57.764
Well, let's see what we have here.

87
00:11:57.847 --> 00:12:01.226
Roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

88
00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:05.521
Try some, Jerry, and pass it around.

89
00:12:06.189 --> 00:12:09.275
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

90
00:12:12.654 --> 00:12:15.740
Captain, I don't know how
you feel about this shrimp,

91
00:12:15.823 --> 00:12:18.076
but if you'll eat it,

92
00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:21.329
you'll never have to prove
your courage in any other way.

93
00:12:22.372 --> 00:12:25.375
Right, well,
why don't I just take a piece here?

94
00:12:26.334 --> 00:12:29.837
Captain,
you've heard of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

95
00:12:32.382 --> 00:12:34.133
Yes, sir, I've heard the name.

96
00:12:35.218 --> 00:12:36.386
Jesus.

97
00:12:36.469 --> 00:12:38.972
Operations officer, Fifth Special Forces.

98
00:12:39.472 --> 00:12:42.141
Luke, would you play
that tape for the Captain, please?

99
00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:45.395
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.

100
00:12:47.814 --> 00:12:50.942
October 9, 0430 hours,
sector Peter Victor King.

101
00:12:51.025 --> 00:12:53.236
These were monitored out of Cambodia.

102
00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:56.864
This has been
verified as Colonel Kurtz's voice.

103
00:12:56.948 --> 00:12:59.617
I watched a snail...

104
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.912
crawl along the edge...

105
00:13:03.955 --> 00:13:05.665
of a straight razor.

106
00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:08.918
That's my dream.

107
00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:12.880
It's my nightmare.

108
00:13:15.508 --> 00:13:17.385
Crawling, slithering...

109
00:13:18.678 --> 00:13:20.305
along the edge...

110
00:13:21.973 --> 00:13:25.143
of a straight razor...

111
00:13:27.395 --> 00:13:28.896
and surviving.

112
00:13:31.858 --> 00:13:36.612
Transmission 11, received '68,
December 30, 0500 hours.

113
00:13:36.696 --> 00:13:38.573
Sector King Zulu King.

114
00:13:40.325 --> 00:13:42.660
But we must kill them.

115
00:13:42.744 --> 00:13:44.996
We must incinerate them,

116
00:13:45.079 --> 00:13:46.581
pig after pig...

117
00:13:47.874 --> 00:13:49.834
cow after cow...

118
00:13:51.669 --> 00:13:53.713
village after village,

119
00:13:53.796 --> 00:13:55.381
army after army.

120
00:13:56.257 --> 00:13:58.676
And they call me an assassin.

121
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.848
What do you call it when
the assassins accuse the assassin?

122
00:14:04.682 --> 00:14:05.683
They lie.

123
00:14:06.434 --> 00:14:08.936
They lie, and we have to be merciful

124
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.938
for those who lie.

125
00:14:11.856 --> 00:14:15.234
Those Nabobs...

126
00:14:17.028 --> 00:14:18.696
I hate them.

127
00:14:19.822 --> 00:14:21.532
I do hate them.

128
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.999
Walt Kurtz
was one of the most outstanding officers

129
00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:32.585
this country's ever produced.

130
00:14:32.668 --> 00:14:35.838
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.

131
00:14:36.672 --> 00:14:39.342
And he was a good man, too.

132
00:14:39.425 --> 00:14:41.052
A humanitarian man.

133
00:14:42.303 --> 00:14:44.180
A man of wit and humor.

134
00:14:45.681 --> 00:14:47.642
He joined the Special Forces.

135
00:14:49.685 --> 00:14:51.479
And after that...

136
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:56.317
his ideas, methods...

137
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.113
became...

138
00:15:02.532 --> 00:15:03.950
unsound.

139
00:15:09.414 --> 00:15:11.082
Unsound.

140
00:15:16.421 --> 00:15:21.008
Now he's crossed into Cambodia
with this Montagnard army of his

141
00:15:21.092 --> 00:15:24.846
that worship the man like a god.

142
00:15:25.596 --> 00:15:29.016
And follow every order,
however ridiculous.

143
00:15:30.601 --> 00:15:34.814
Well, I have some
other shocking news to tell you.

144
00:15:35.273 --> 00:15:37.608
Colonel Kurtz is about to be

145
00:15:38.484 --> 00:15:40.486
arrested for murder.

146
00:15:41.195 --> 00:15:44.240
I don't follow, sir. Murdered who?

147
00:15:44.323 --> 00:15:48.494
Kurtz had ordered the execution
of some Vietnamese intelligence agents.

148
00:15:48.578 --> 00:15:50.997
Men he believed were double agents.

149
00:15:52.498 --> 00:15:55.126
So he took matters into his own hands.

150
00:15:57.336 --> 00:15:59.338
Well, you see, Willard...

151
00:16:00.506 --> 00:16:02.508
in this war, things get...

152
00:16:03.843 --> 00:16:05.887
confused out there.

153
00:16:06.804 --> 00:16:10.349
Power, ideals, the old morality,

154
00:16:10.433 --> 00:16:13.060
and practical military necessity.

155
00:16:15.104 --> 00:16:17.523
But out there with these natives...

156
00:16:18.691 --> 00:16:21.652
it must be a temptation...

157
00:16:23.488 --> 00:16:24.655
to be God.

158
00:16:28.451 --> 00:16:31.662
Because there's
a conflict in every human heart...

159
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.625
between the rational and the irrational,

160
00:16:36.459 --> 00:16:38.336
between good and evil.

161
00:16:39.837 --> 00:16:42.173
And good does not always triumph.

162
00:16:44.717 --> 00:16:46.135
Sometimes...

163
00:16:47.845 --> 00:16:49.472
the dark side

164
00:16:50.139 --> 00:16:54.519
overcomes what Lincoln called,
"The better angels of our nature."

165
00:16:56.395 --> 00:16:59.023
Every man has got a breaking point.

166
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.484
You and I have them.

167
00:17:03.152 --> 00:17:05.279
Walt Kurtz has reached his...

168
00:17:07.365 --> 00:17:10.034
and very obviously he has gone insane.

169
00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:27.218
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

170
00:17:31.722 --> 00:17:35.309
Your mission is to proceed
up the Nung River in a Navy patrol boat...

171
00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:40.147
pick up Colonel
Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba,

172
00:17:40.606 --> 00:17:43.568
follow it,
learn what you can along the way.

173
00:17:43.651 --> 00:17:46.445
When you find the Colonel,
infiltrate his team by

174
00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:49.073
whatever means available

175
00:17:49.949 --> 00:17:52.118
and terminate the Colonel's command.

176
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:01.127
Terminate the Colonel?

177
00:18:02.003 --> 00:18:06.215
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint,

178
00:18:06.299 --> 00:18:12.179
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable human conduct.

179
00:18:12.263 --> 00:18:15.349
And he is still in the field,
commanding troops.

180
00:18:16.851 --> 00:18:20.229
Terminate with extreme prejudice.

181
00:18:21.939 --> 00:18:25.318
You understand, Captain,
that this mission does not exist...

182
00:18:27.153 --> 00:18:29.071
nor will it ever exist.

183
00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:27.046
How many
people had I already killed?

184
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.050
There were those six
that I knew about for sure.

185
00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:35.137
Close enough to blow
their last breath in my face.

186
00:19:37.473 --> 00:19:42.395
But this time it was
an American and an officer.

187
00:19:53.989 --> 00:19:58.327
That wasn't supposed to make
any difference to me, but it did.

188
00:20:00.913 --> 00:20:04.417
Shit, charging a man
with murder in this place

189
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.045
was like handing out
speeding tickets at the Indy 500.

190
00:20:10.131 --> 00:20:14.301
I took the mission.
What the hell else was I gonna do?

191
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.849
But I really didn't know
what I'd do when I found him.

192
00:20:26.814 --> 00:20:29.400
Did you check the tank?

193
00:20:29.483 --> 00:20:30.943
Yeah.

194
00:20:32.695 --> 00:20:36.282
I was being ferried
down the coast in a Navy PBR.

195
00:20:36.365 --> 00:20:40.870
A type of plastic patrol boat,
a pretty common sight on the rivers.

196
00:20:40.953 --> 00:20:43.330
They said it was a good way
to pick up information and move

197
00:20:43.414 --> 00:20:45.916
without drawing a lot of attention.

198
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.835
And that was okay.

199
00:20:47.918 --> 00:20:50.087
I needed the air and the time.

200
00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.340
Only problem was, I wouldn't be alone.

201
00:20:53.424 --> 00:20:55.259
Morning, Captain.

202
00:20:57.636 --> 00:21:00.890
The crew were mostly just kids.

203
00:21:00.973 --> 00:21:04.059
Rock 'n' rollers
with one foot in their graves.

204
00:21:05.102 --> 00:21:07.438
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

205
00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:10.691
The machinist,
the one they called Chef,

206
00:21:10.775 --> 00:21:12.234
was from New Orleans.

207
00:21:12.318 --> 00:21:15.196
He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.

208
00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:17.740
Probably wrapped
too tight for New Orleans.

209
00:21:18.264 --> 00:21:20.558
Lance, on the forward .50s,
was a famous surfer

210
00:21:20.642 --> 00:21:22.936
from the beaches south of LA.

211
00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:26.981
To look at him, you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.

212
00:21:28.775 --> 00:21:33.113
Clean, Mr. Clean,
was from some South Bronx shithole,

213
00:21:33.196 --> 00:21:35.281
and I think the light and space of Vietnam

214
00:21:35.365 --> 00:21:37.617
really put the zap on his head.

215
00:21:40.537 --> 00:21:42.914
Then there was Phillips, the Chief.

216
00:21:42.997 --> 00:21:46.876
It might have been my mission,
but it sure as shit was the Chief's boat.

217
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.212
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water

218
00:21:49.295 --> 00:21:51.589
to get into the Nung River.

219
00:21:51.673 --> 00:21:54.175
They're both hot, belong to Charlie.

220
00:21:55.844 --> 00:21:57.345
Don't worry about it.

221
00:21:58.179 --> 00:21:59.681
Don't smoke.

222
00:22:01.683 --> 00:22:04.853
You know,
I've pulled a few special ops in here.

223
00:22:04.936 --> 00:22:06.855
About six months ago,

224
00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:10.775
I took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Luong.

225
00:22:12.026 --> 00:22:13.987
He was regular Army, too.

226
00:22:16.614 --> 00:22:19.117
I heard he shot himself in the head.

227
00:22:28.001 --> 00:22:31.254
At first, I thought
they handed me the wrong dossier.

228
00:22:31.838 --> 00:22:34.549
I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead.

229
00:22:36.259 --> 00:22:39.137
Third-generation West Point,
top of his class,

230
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.809
Korea, Airborne, about 1,000 decorations,
et cetera, et cetera.

231
00:22:48.229 --> 00:22:52.442
I had heard his voice on the tape
and it really put the hook in me,

232
00:22:53.193 --> 00:22:56.863
but I couldn't connect up
that voice with this man.

233
00:23:03.912 --> 00:23:06.831
Like they said,
he had an impressive career.

234
00:23:07.749 --> 00:23:09.584
Maybe too impressive.

235
00:23:10.627 --> 00:23:12.170
I mean, perfect.

236
00:23:13.213 --> 00:23:17.091
He was being groomed for one
of the top slots in the corporation,

237
00:23:17.175 --> 00:23:20.011
General, Chief of Staff, anything.

238
00:23:22.263 --> 00:23:26.351
In 1964, he returned from a tour
with advisory command in Vietnam

239
00:23:26.434 --> 00:23:28.770
and things started to slip.

240
00:23:28.853 --> 00:23:33.107
His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.

241
00:23:35.401 --> 00:23:37.278
Seems they didn't dig
what he had to tell them.

242
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.033
During the next few months,
he made three requests for transfer

243
00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:47.330
to Airborne training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted.

244
00:23:50.083 --> 00:23:51.543
Airborne?

245
00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:56.047
He was 38 years old.

246
00:23:58.007 --> 00:24:00.218
Why the fuck would he do that?

247
00:24:02.512 --> 00:24:05.807
1966, joins Special Forces...

248
00:24:06.891 --> 00:24:08.309
returns Vietnam.

249
00:24:10.019 --> 00:24:12.063
- Hey, what's that?
- Arc light.

250
00:24:12.146 --> 00:24:15.066
- What's that?
- B-52 strike.

251
00:24:17.068 --> 00:24:18.403
- What's that?
- Arc light.

252
00:24:18.486 --> 00:24:21.573
I hate that. Every time
I hear that, something terrible happens.

253
00:24:21.656 --> 00:24:23.658
Charlie don't never see them
or hear them, man.

254
00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:24.742
There they are.

255
00:24:24.826 --> 00:24:27.453
Concussion will suck
the air out of your damn lungs.

256
00:24:27.996 --> 00:24:31.082
- Something terrible's gonna happen.
- Smoke!

257
00:24:31.165 --> 00:24:32.917
Secondary burning.

258
00:24:33.001 --> 00:24:34.878
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

259
00:24:34.961 --> 00:24:35.962
Let's have a look, Chief.

260
00:24:39.757 --> 00:24:42.677
It was the air cav,
First of the Ninth.

261
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.887
That's them.

262
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.431
Our escorts
to the mouth of the Nung River.

263
00:24:46.514 --> 00:24:50.435
But they were supposed to be
waiting for us another 30 km ahead.

264
00:24:50.518 --> 00:24:54.981
Well, Airmobile,
those boys just couldn't stay put.

265
00:25:07.452 --> 00:25:10.580
Kid, come on. Get down. Come on.

266
00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:24.344
First of the Ninth
was an old cavalry division

267
00:25:24.427 --> 00:25:27.972
that had cashed in its horses for
choppers and gone tear-as sing around Nam

268
00:25:28.056 --> 00:25:29.891
looking for the shit.

269
00:25:30.391 --> 00:25:34.228
They'd given Charlie a few
surprises in their time here.

270
00:25:35.146 --> 00:25:38.775
What they were mopping up now
hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.

271
00:25:40.234 --> 00:25:42.362
Just keep running by.
Run for television.

272
00:25:42.445 --> 00:25:44.864
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep... Go on! Keep going.

273
00:25:44.948 --> 00:25:46.532
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

274
00:25:46.616 --> 00:25:47.700
Don't look at the camera.

275
00:25:47.784 --> 00:25:50.203
Just go by like you're fighting.
Like you're fighting.

276
00:25:50.286 --> 00:25:52.705
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television. Just go through!

277
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:55.291
Go through! Just go by! Keep on going!

278
00:25:55.375 --> 00:25:59.253
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.

279
00:26:22.318 --> 00:26:24.862
- Where can I find the CO?
- That's the Colonel coming down!

280
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.834
The CO's on that chopper.

281
00:27:00.898 --> 00:27:04.402
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line
back about 100 yards!

282
00:27:04.485 --> 00:27:07.030
- Give me some room to breathe!
- Yes, sir!

283
00:27:12.869 --> 00:27:14.704
- Body cards!
- Sir?

284
00:27:14.787 --> 00:27:16.914
- Bring my body cards!
- Yes, sir!

285
00:27:21.044 --> 00:27:23.546
I'm the fourth tank commander.
I got five tanks broken down.

286
00:27:23.629 --> 00:27:26.591
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

287
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:28.134
Captain Willard!

288
00:27:28.217 --> 00:27:32.013
I carry priority papers
from COMSEC Intelligence, Il Corps.

289
00:27:32.096 --> 00:27:35.767
I understand Nha Trang has briefed you
on the requirements of my mission.

290
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.519
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.

291
00:27:38.603 --> 00:27:41.355
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

292
00:27:41.439 --> 00:27:43.357
- We'll see what we can do, but...
- Colonel.

293
00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:45.276
...just stay out of my way
until this is done, Captain.

294
00:27:51.449 --> 00:27:54.035
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

295
00:27:54.118 --> 00:27:58.164
A two of spades, three of spades,
four of diamonds...

296
00:27:59.248 --> 00:28:01.959
six of clubs, eight of spades.

297
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.589
There isn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch. Four of diamonds.

298
00:28:08.257 --> 00:28:12.386
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death cards!

299
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.223
- What?
- Death cards!

300
00:28:15.306 --> 00:28:17.975
- Death?
- It lets Charlie know who did this.

301
00:28:21.813 --> 00:28:24.232
- Cheer up, son.
- We will not hurt or harm you.

302
00:28:24.315 --> 00:28:26.943
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

303
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.906
This is an area that is controlled

304
00:28:31.989 --> 00:28:35.368
by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.

305
00:28:40.206 --> 00:28:42.250
We are here to help you.

306
00:28:45.545 --> 00:28:48.422
We are here
to extend a welcome hand

307
00:28:48.506 --> 00:28:51.008
- to those of you who would like...
- Come on. Everybody in?

308
00:28:51.092 --> 00:28:54.262
...to return to the arms
of the South Vietnamese government.

309
00:28:56.556 --> 00:28:57.807
Hurry up!

310
00:28:58.975 --> 00:29:01.394
Move it out!

311
00:29:01.477 --> 00:29:07.900
This is an area that is controlled
by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.

312
00:29:07.984 --> 00:29:09.527
Hey! What's this?

313
00:29:10.695 --> 00:29:12.029
What is this?

314
00:29:12.864 --> 00:29:15.116
This man's hurt pretty bad, sir.

315
00:29:15.199 --> 00:29:17.451
About the only thing
that's holding his guts in, sir,

316
00:29:17.535 --> 00:29:19.162
- Is that pot lid.
- Yeah?

317
00:29:19.245 --> 00:29:20.746
What does he have to say?

318
00:29:21.455 --> 00:29:23.583
This soldier is dirty VC.

319
00:29:23.666 --> 00:29:26.961
He wants water. He can drink paddy water.

320
00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.590
Get out of here! Give me that canteen.

321
00:29:30.776 --> 00:29:33.738
- He's VC!
- Any man that's brave enough to...

322
00:29:33.821 --> 00:29:36.824
Get out of here!
I'll kick your fucking ass!

323
00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:38.159
He killed a lot of our people!

324
00:29:38.242 --> 00:29:41.078
Any man brave enough to fight
with his guts strapped on him

325
00:29:41.162 --> 00:29:42.997
can drink from my canteen any day!

326
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.876
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those
sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

327
00:29:46.959 --> 00:29:49.754
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.

328
00:29:51.255 --> 00:29:52.673
Yeah? Here.

329
00:29:53.257 --> 00:29:56.010
Repeat, we have a body count. We have...

330
00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.015
What's your name, sailor?

331
00:30:01.098 --> 00:30:03.017
Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson, sir!

332
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.437
- Gunner's Mate Third Class...
- Wait. Lance Johnson, the surfer?

333
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.772
Yes, sir.

334
00:30:08.356 --> 00:30:12.276
Well, it's an honor to meet you, Lance.
I've admired your nose riding for years.

335
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.321
I like your cutback, too. I think
you have the best cutback there is.

336
00:30:15.404 --> 00:30:18.115
- Thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap, Lance.

337
00:30:18.199 --> 00:30:20.201
I'm Bill Kilgore. I'm a goofy foot.

338
00:30:20.284 --> 00:30:22.453
- This guy with you?
- Yeah.

339
00:30:22.536 --> 00:30:25.623
I want you to meet some guys.
This is Mike from San Diego.

340
00:30:25.706 --> 00:30:27.333
- Far out.
- Johnny from Malibu.

341
00:30:27.416 --> 00:30:29.543
- John, hi. Far out.
- Pretty solid surfers.

342
00:30:29.627 --> 00:30:31.420
None of us are anywhere
near your class, though.

343
00:30:31.504 --> 00:30:32.922
No way.

344
00:30:33.005 --> 00:30:36.842
We do a lot of surfing around here, Lance.
I like to finish operations early,

345
00:30:36.926 --> 00:30:39.971
fly down to Vung Tau
for the evening glass.

346
00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:42.014
Been riding since you got here?

347
00:30:42.098 --> 00:30:44.183
No way.
I haven't surfed since I been here.

348
00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:48.938
Through Christ our Lord,
from whom all good things come.

349
00:30:49.021 --> 00:30:51.857
Through him
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

350
00:30:51.941 --> 00:30:55.611
all glory and honor is yours,
Almighty Father. Amen.

351
00:30:55.695 --> 00:30:59.657
Let us pray with confidence to the Father
in the words our savior gave us.

352
00:31:00.199 --> 00:31:04.412
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

353
00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:07.081
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done

354
00:31:07.164 --> 00:31:09.250
on Earth as it is in heaven.

355
00:31:09.333 --> 00:31:11.294
Give us this day our daily bread...

356
00:31:13.379 --> 00:31:16.257
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

357
00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.802
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

358
00:31:29.812 --> 00:31:32.940
Kilgore had had
a pretty good day for himself.

359
00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:35.276
They choppered in the T-bones and the beer

360
00:31:35.359 --> 00:31:37.778
and turned the LZ into a beach party.

361
00:31:38.988 --> 00:31:41.699
The more they tried
to make it just like home,

362
00:31:41.782 --> 00:31:44.493
the more they made everybody miss it.

363
00:31:44.577 --> 00:31:47.788
Make my meat rare, rare but not cold!

364
00:31:53.586 --> 00:31:56.422
Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess.

365
00:31:57.381 --> 00:32:00.968
He loved his boys
and you felt safe with him.

366
00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:04.430
He was one of those guys that
had that weird light around him.

367
00:32:04.513 --> 00:32:07.850
<i>You just knew he wasn't gonna
get so much as a scratch here.</i>

368
00:32:07.933 --> 00:32:09.769
What happened to your mission, Captain?

369
00:32:09.852 --> 00:32:11.520
Nha Trang forget all about you?

370
00:32:19.945 --> 00:32:22.573
Airborne.

371
00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.619
Sir, two places
we can get into the river...

372
00:32:26.702 --> 00:32:29.330
- Yeah.
- ...here and here.

373
00:32:29.413 --> 00:32:33.209
It's a pretty wide delta, but these
are the only two spots I'm really sure of.

374
00:32:34.543 --> 00:32:37.463
Well, that village you're
pointing at is kind of hairy, Willard.

375
00:32:37.963 --> 00:32:40.216
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy,

376
00:32:40.299 --> 00:32:42.051
got some pretty heavy ordnance.

377
00:32:42.134 --> 00:32:45.137
I lost a few recon ships
in there now and again.

378
00:32:45.221 --> 00:32:47.640
What's the name of that goddamn village?
Vin Drin...

379
00:32:47.723 --> 00:32:49.600
- Dop.
- Dop or Lop?

380
00:32:50.351 --> 00:32:52.812
Damn gook names all sound the same.

381
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.817
Mike, you know anything
about this point at Vin Drin Dop?

382
00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.402
That's a fantastic peak.

383
00:33:00.194 --> 00:33:02.113
- Peak?
- About six foot.

384
00:33:02.321 --> 00:33:05.533
Yeah, it's an outstanding peak. It's got
both the long right and left slide

385
00:33:05.616 --> 00:33:08.953
with a bowl section. It's unbelievable.
It's just tube city.

386
00:33:13.582 --> 00:33:15.709
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?
A good peak.

387
00:33:15.793 --> 00:33:18.337
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

388
00:33:18.421 --> 00:33:21.298
- It's all goddamn beach break.
- It's really hairy in there, sir.

389
00:33:21.382 --> 00:33:24.301
That's where we lost McDonald.
They shot the hell out of us there.

390
00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.637
That's Charlie's point.

391
00:33:28.013 --> 00:33:30.558
Sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.

392
00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:32.893
There's always a good
offshore breeze in the morning.

393
00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:34.937
We may not be
able to get the boat in.

394
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.356
The draft at the mouth of
that river may be too shallow.

395
00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:41.735
We'll pick your boat up and put it
down like a baby, right where you want it.

396
00:33:41.819 --> 00:33:45.239
This is the First of the Ninth air cav,
son. Airmobile.

397
00:33:46.407 --> 00:33:48.409
I can take that point
and hold it just as long as I like.

398
00:33:48.492 --> 00:33:51.662
And you can get any place up that
river that suits you, young Captain.

399
00:33:52.121 --> 00:33:53.497
Hell, a six-foot peak.

400
00:33:55.958 --> 00:33:57.793
All right,
take a gunship back to the division.

401
00:33:57.877 --> 00:33:59.962
Lance, go with Mike
and let him pick out a board for you,

402
00:34:00.045 --> 00:34:01.797
and bring me my Yater Spoon, the 8'6".

403
00:34:01.881 --> 00:34:04.550
- I don't know, sir, it's...
- What is it, soldier?

404
00:34:04.633 --> 00:34:07.303
Well, I mean, it's pretty hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.

405
00:34:07.386 --> 00:34:09.555
Charlie don't surf!

406
00:34:33.162 --> 00:34:36.624
Hey, Jesus, Clean,
you ain't gonna believe this. Look.

407
00:34:37.833 --> 00:34:40.628
Hey, man!
They're picking up the boat!

408
00:34:43.714 --> 00:34:47.551
- How are you feeling, Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

409
00:34:49.803 --> 00:34:51.889
All right, son, let her rip.

410
00:34:51.972 --> 00:34:52.973
Let's go!

411
00:36:16.599 --> 00:36:18.809
I never have
gotten used to a light board,

412
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.395
and I can't get used to one.
I'm used to a heavy board.

413
00:36:21.478 --> 00:36:23.105
I know, it's a real drag.

414
00:36:23.897 --> 00:36:26.650
- You prefer a heavy or a light board?
- Heavier.

415
00:36:26.734 --> 00:36:27.943
- Really?
- Yeah!

416
00:36:28.027 --> 00:36:30.070
I thought all the young
guys like lighter boards.

417
00:36:30.154 --> 00:36:32.364
You can't ride the nose on those things.

418
00:36:32.448 --> 00:36:35.784
Big Duke Six, this is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.

419
00:36:35.868 --> 00:36:39.246
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,
put on heading 2-7-0.

420
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.081
Assume attack formation.

421
00:36:41.165 --> 00:36:43.751
That's a roger, Big Duke.
Okay, we're going in.

422
00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:47.755
Lance, we'll come in low
out of the rising sun,

423
00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:50.257
and about a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

424
00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:52.801
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.

425
00:36:52.885 --> 00:36:56.263
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.

426
00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:58.974
Hey, they're gonna play music!

427
00:37:05.939 --> 00:37:08.525
How come all you guys sit on your helmet?

428
00:37:09.735 --> 00:37:12.279
So we don't get our balls blown off.

429
00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.587
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,
put on psy war op, make it loud.

430
00:37:28.671 --> 00:37:32.132
This is a Romeo Foxtrot. Shall we dance?

431
00:37:36.595 --> 00:37:38.347
- Jimmy!
- Yes, sir!

432
00:40:17.923 --> 00:40:18.966
Run, Charlie!

433
00:40:38.777 --> 00:40:41.071
We got some...
There's more and more down there.

434
00:40:41.154 --> 00:40:43.824
Look out, automatic .50-cal!
.50-cal in the open!

435
00:40:44.324 --> 00:40:48.036
I've spotted a large weapon down below.
We're gonna go down and check it out.

436
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.330
All right, this is Fox Five.
We're going in.

437
00:41:01.049 --> 00:41:04.219
- All right. What a shot.
- Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.

438
00:41:04.303 --> 00:41:05.596
Get you a case of beer for that.

439
00:41:27.409 --> 00:41:30.120
6-4-1-0,
we're over the village right now.

440
00:41:30.203 --> 00:41:32.080
I think I see a vehicle
down in the courtyard.

441
00:41:32.164 --> 00:41:35.459
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Well done, hawks. Well done.

442
00:41:35.542 --> 00:41:38.754
I want some 20 Mike-Mike
Vulcan right along those tree lines.

443
00:41:38.837 --> 00:41:40.130
Ripple the shit out of them.

444
00:41:40.839 --> 00:41:43.050
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
50 caliber on board.

445
00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:45.802
He's moving across to resupply the weapon.

446
00:41:46.261 --> 00:41:49.556
Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down myself.

447
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.974
Don't these people ever give up?

448
00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:57.314
Nice shot, Bill.

449
00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:00.233
- Shit!
- All right, all right!

450
00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:05.572
- It's just a flare!
- It's a flare! Gotta get out of here!

451
00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:07.616
Un-ass that shit. Get it out of here!

452
00:42:07.699 --> 00:42:11.495
Get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right. It's just a flare.

453
00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:14.831
- Everybody all right? Lance?
- I'm fine!

454
00:42:29.846 --> 00:42:31.139
Get down!

455
00:42:51.618 --> 00:42:55.914
I'm not going!
I'm not going! I'm not going!

456
00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:12.514
We just got a secondary
down there in the plaza.

457
00:43:12.597 --> 00:43:15.475
Blue Three, Blue Four,
hold out over position...

458
00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:18.729
Duke Six, Duke Six,
we've got wounded down there.

459
00:43:23.373 --> 00:43:26.418
My God! Oh, my God!

460
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.756
- Get a stretcher over here!
- You're all right.

461
00:43:30.839 --> 00:43:32.716
Please! Help me!

462
00:43:35.427 --> 00:43:38.263
- Please, God! Help me!
- Stay with me, son, you're gonna be okay.

463
00:43:39.556 --> 00:43:41.308
- Let's give him some morphine.
- My God! My God!

464
00:43:41.391 --> 00:43:43.810
- 0-3-7-7-4-2.
- Where's that duster?

465
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.545
I want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 15 minutes.

466
00:43:48.628 --> 00:43:50.463
I want my men out.

467
00:43:50.547 --> 00:43:52.257
Somebody stay in
there tight with Big Duke.

468
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:56.303
This is 10-10. We're gonna
be in, throw them on and get out...

469
00:44:18.199 --> 00:44:20.869
She's got a grenade! She's got a grenade!

470
00:44:23.538 --> 00:44:25.749
Jesus! The whole goddamn thing just...

471
00:44:25.832 --> 00:44:27.751
- She blew the shit out of...
- Fucking savages.

472
00:44:30.045 --> 00:44:31.254
Can I get a medevac?

473
00:44:31.338 --> 00:44:32.922
What's going on...
Holy Christ, she's a sapper.

474
00:44:33.006 --> 00:44:35.383
I'm gonna get that dink bitch.
Get over there, Johnny. Go in there.

475
00:44:35.467 --> 00:44:37.510
Put that right skid right up her ass.

476
00:44:40.263 --> 00:44:43.266
We gotta get some air in these trees.
It's goddamn eat up with enemy down there.

477
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:45.643
I'm taking fire.
I'm taking hits all over...

478
00:44:45.727 --> 00:44:49.314
Three o'clock! Three o'clock, my position!
Drawing fire, drawing heavy fire!

479
00:44:49.397 --> 00:44:52.525
I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! I'm going in.
My tail rotor's out. I got control.

480
00:45:01.868 --> 00:45:04.454
- What do you think?
- Wow, this is really exciting, man.

481
00:45:04.537 --> 00:45:07.791
- No, no! The waves! The waves!
- Oh, right.

482
00:45:07.874 --> 00:45:10.794
Look at that, breaks both ways.
Watch. Watch.

483
00:45:12.045 --> 00:45:14.255
Look! Good six-foot swells!

484
00:45:38.571 --> 00:45:40.115
Come here, Lance.

485
00:45:43.034 --> 00:45:44.160
Incoming!

486
00:45:48.623 --> 00:45:51.793
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.
Maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.

487
00:45:51.876 --> 00:45:55.880
What do you know about surfing, Major?
You're from goddamn New Jersey.

488
00:45:57.757 --> 00:45:59.342
Come here! Come here!

489
00:46:02.637 --> 00:46:05.181
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?

490
00:46:05.265 --> 00:46:08.143
I wanna see how ride able that stuff is.
Go change.

491
00:46:08.226 --> 00:46:09.853
It's still pretty hairy out there, sir.

492
00:46:09.936 --> 00:46:12.188
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

493
00:46:12.272 --> 00:46:17.235
That's good, son, 'cause you either
surf or fight. That clear? Now get going.

494
00:46:17.318 --> 00:46:20.447
I'll cover for them.
And bring a board for Lance!

495
00:46:21.739 --> 00:46:24.159
We can't do shit till the boat gets here.

496
00:46:24.242 --> 00:46:27.745
Lance,
I'll bet you can't wait to get out there.

497
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:29.873
- What?
- See how they break both ways?

498
00:46:29.956 --> 00:46:33.835
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think of that?

499
00:46:33.918 --> 00:46:36.045
We ought to wait for the tide to come up.

500
00:46:36.129 --> 00:46:38.923
- Lance, come here. Look. Look!
- Incoming!

501
00:46:41.593 --> 00:46:44.220
The tide doesn't come in for six hours!

502
00:46:46.097 --> 00:46:48.558
You wanna wait here for six hours?

503
00:46:51.895 --> 00:46:54.022
Yo! Hey! Chief!

504
00:47:02.184 --> 00:47:05.062
Okay, fellas,
quit hiding. Come on!

505
00:47:05.729 --> 00:47:08.273
- Let's go, dickheads, take off!
- God damn it!

506
00:47:08.357 --> 00:47:10.943
Don't you think
it's a little risky for R&R?

507
00:47:11.026 --> 00:47:15.614
If I say it's safe to surf this beach,
Captain, it's safe to surf this beach!

508
00:47:15.697 --> 00:47:20.035
I mean, I'm not afraid to surf this place!
I'll surf this fucking place.

509
00:47:22.538 --> 00:47:24.540
Give me that RT, soldier.

510
00:47:25.999 --> 00:47:28.210
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.

511
00:47:28.544 --> 00:47:31.463
God damn it! I want that tree line bombed!

512
00:47:31.547 --> 00:47:34.341
Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by.

513
00:47:34.424 --> 00:47:36.218
Blow them into the Stone Age, son!

514
00:47:37.469 --> 00:47:39.596
No, back, no!

515
00:47:39.846 --> 00:47:42.015
All right, now. Let me take care of this.
You all right?

516
00:47:42.099 --> 00:47:43.225
Get that out of here!

517
00:47:43.308 --> 00:47:46.478
- I'm sorry.
- Come here now. All right.

518
00:47:46.562 --> 00:47:48.981
- No, ma'am. Sorry!
- Jimmy!

519
00:47:49.064 --> 00:47:51.066
Hawk One-Two,
Dove One-Three, roger.

520
00:47:51.149 --> 00:47:52.651
They need some napalm
down there in the tree line.

521
00:47:52.734 --> 00:47:54.653
Can you guys push
ground and put it down there?

522
00:47:54.736 --> 00:47:57.573
Right, One-Three. We're fixing
to fuck with them. What's the target?

523
00:47:57.656 --> 00:48:00.867
We're trying to suppress some
mortar fire off the tree line down there.

524
00:48:00.951 --> 00:48:02.160
Roger. Here we come.

525
00:48:02.244 --> 00:48:06.164
Good, give it all you got.
Bring in all your ships.

526
00:48:06.248 --> 00:48:09.626
Medevac him in my chopper.
Get him back to the hospital.

527
00:48:09.793 --> 00:48:13.213
No, no, no, you got to go with him.
Come on! Go! Go!

528
00:48:13.297 --> 00:48:16.925
Get it out of here!
And tell my guys I want my board!

529
00:48:17.009 --> 00:48:18.552
Brig Duke Six,
this is Dove One-Three.

530
00:48:18.635 --> 00:48:21.388
The jets are inbound now.
You got about 30 seconds to on-station.

531
00:48:21.471 --> 00:48:25.058
Get your people back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one.

532
00:48:27.686 --> 00:48:31.690
Don't worry. We'll have this place
cleaned up and ready in a jiffy, son.

533
00:48:31.773 --> 00:48:33.400
Don't you worry.

534
00:48:33.483 --> 00:48:35.944
Give me those shorts.

535
00:48:37.237 --> 00:48:40.866
These are from the air cav,
a present from me and the boys.

536
00:48:40.949 --> 00:48:45.245
I want to see you do your
stuff in them out there. Okay?

537
00:49:07.809 --> 00:49:09.353
You smell that?

538
00:49:09.853 --> 00:49:11.980
- Do you smell that?
- What?

539
00:49:12.773 --> 00:49:14.524
Napalm, son.

540
00:49:14.983 --> 00:49:17.361
Nothing else in the world
smells like that.

541
00:49:17.903 --> 00:49:19.780
Come on.
Move it! Move it! Move it!

542
00:49:21.698 --> 00:49:24.284
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

543
00:49:24.868 --> 00:49:27.454
You know, one time we had
a hill bombed for 12 hours.

544
00:49:27.537 --> 00:49:29.915
And when it was all over, I walked up.

545
00:49:31.124 --> 00:49:34.127
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

546
00:49:36.588 --> 00:49:39.424
But the smell, you know,
that gasoline smell...

547
00:49:39.508 --> 00:49:41.176
The whole hill...

548
00:49:42.344 --> 00:49:44.012
it smelled like...

549
00:49:46.723 --> 00:49:47.974
victory.

550
00:49:53.355 --> 00:49:55.482
Someday this war's gonna end.

551
00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:12.624
- Lance, the wind!
- Huh?

552
00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:14.042
- The wind!
- What?

553
00:50:14.126 --> 00:50:17.963
It's blowing on shore! It's coming
on shore. It's gonna blow this place out!

554
00:50:18.046 --> 00:50:21.174
- It's gonna ruin it!
- Not cool! It's gonna blow out!

555
00:50:21.258 --> 00:50:23.593
It's the goddamn napalm!
That's what's doing it!

556
00:50:23.677 --> 00:50:27.097
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel,
but I'm afraid that does it.

557
00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.851
The kid's got a reputation. You can't
expect him to surf those sloppy waves.

558
00:50:30.934 --> 00:50:33.520
- I understand what you're saying.
- Yeah, I'm an artist, Bill.

559
00:50:33.603 --> 00:50:36.690
- I couldn't surf that stuff.
- Lance, look.

560
00:50:36.773 --> 00:50:38.650
I apologize. It's not my fault.

561
00:50:38.734 --> 00:50:40.402
The waves are getting
blown out by the napalm.

562
00:50:40.485 --> 00:50:41.486
Hey, Bill, don't get me wrong...

563
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:43.572
It was the bombs causing
a vortex with the wind.

564
00:50:43.655 --> 00:50:45.031
I accept your apology.

565
00:50:45.115 --> 00:50:47.659
All right, then. But if you
could hang around just 20 minutes...

566
00:50:47.743 --> 00:50:50.454
- Maybe some other time, Bill.
- Just 20 minutes.

567
00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:54.082
- I'm an artist!
- Keep walking.

568
00:50:54.541 --> 00:50:58.503
Okay, give it a try, guys!
One goes left and one goes right.

569
00:50:58.587 --> 00:51:00.088
Look, Lance.

570
00:51:00.172 --> 00:51:01.673
- You through surfing?
- Yeah!

571
00:51:01.757 --> 00:51:03.633
- Want to say good-bye to the Colonel?
- No.

572
00:51:03.717 --> 00:51:05.010
- You sure?
- Yeah!

573
00:51:05.093 --> 00:51:06.553
Let's get the fuck out of here!

574
00:51:06.636 --> 00:51:11.433
It's the fucking napalm!
Just wait 20 minutes!

575
00:51:11.641 --> 00:51:13.059
Damn! Fuck!

576
00:51:13.143 --> 00:51:15.479
They're looking for you!

577
00:51:18.774 --> 00:51:21.985
- Don't leave without me!
- Where the fuck you going?

578
00:51:24.738 --> 00:51:26.823
Incoming!

579
00:51:28.283 --> 00:51:32.329
- The colonel's surfboard!
- Get the fuck off me! It's mine!

580
00:51:33.038 --> 00:51:37.042
- Guys, help!
- Get the board and let's get out of here!

581
00:51:41.087 --> 00:51:43.340
Fucking Airborne!

582
00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:16.748
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.

583
00:52:16.832 --> 00:52:18.208
Come on. Let's get high.

584
00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:20.252
- Want to smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.

585
00:52:20.335 --> 00:52:22.587
Someday this war's gonna end.

586
00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:26.424
That would be just fine
with the boys on the boat.

587
00:52:26.883 --> 00:52:29.010
They weren't looking
for anything more than a way home.

588
00:52:29.094 --> 00:52:30.345
Captain?

589
00:52:30.846 --> 00:52:33.473
Trouble is, I'd been back there

590
00:52:34.266 --> 00:52:37.102
and I knew that it
just didn't exist any more.

591
00:52:40.856 --> 00:52:42.607
Buddha time, here.

592
00:52:43.483 --> 00:52:46.862
All right, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

593
00:52:51.867 --> 00:52:54.411
If that's how Kilgore fought the war,

594
00:52:54.494 --> 00:52:57.873
I began to wonder what
they really had against Kurtz.

595
00:52:58.582 --> 00:53:01.042
It wasn't just insanity and murder.

596
00:53:01.543 --> 00:53:04.838
There was enough of that
to go around for everyone.

597
00:53:15.223 --> 00:53:17.058
I mean,
he never was hurting for pussy.

598
00:53:17.142 --> 00:53:18.602
I'm not here.

599
00:53:19.728 --> 00:53:22.856
I'm walking through the jungle
gathering mangos.

600
00:53:23.773 --> 00:53:25.567
I meet Raquel Welch.

601
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:30.572
I make a nice mango cream pudding...

602
00:53:34.326 --> 00:53:36.828
kind of spread it around on us.

603
00:53:36.912 --> 00:53:43.585
She's into mangos, too.
She's, like, one limb above me.

604
00:53:43.668 --> 00:53:45.795
We're both in the jungle here, nude.

605
00:53:45.879 --> 00:53:47.505
- Hey, Chief.
- Yeah?

606
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:50.383
Here comes that Colonel guy again.

607
00:53:52.093 --> 00:53:55.472
You know how
hard it is to find a board you like?

608
00:53:55.555 --> 00:53:58.099
I will not hurt or harm you.

609
00:53:58.183 --> 00:54:01.019
I will not hurt or harm you.

610
00:54:01.102 --> 00:54:03.772
Just give me back the board, Lance.

611
00:54:03.855 --> 00:54:07.108
It was a good board, and I like it.

612
00:54:07.192 --> 00:54:09.736
You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.

613
00:54:09.819 --> 00:54:11.780
He's a determined motherfucker!

614
00:54:11.863 --> 00:54:12.989
I will not hurt or harm you.

615
00:54:13.073 --> 00:54:16.826
- Cocksucker!
- I will not hurt or harm you.

616
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:19.663
Just give me back the board, Lance.

617
00:54:19.746 --> 00:54:22.749
It was a good board, and I like it.

618
00:54:22.832 --> 00:54:26.419
You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.

619
00:54:26.962 --> 00:54:28.672
I will not hurt or harm you.

620
00:54:28.755 --> 00:54:32.384
Jesus Christ.
That guy's too fucking much, man.

621
00:54:32.467 --> 00:54:35.595
Do you think he would have shot us?

622
00:54:35.679 --> 00:54:36.805
He wouldn't have shot us on the beach,

623
00:54:36.888 --> 00:54:39.349
but I think he would have shot
us if he saw me taking his board.

624
00:54:42.811 --> 00:54:44.437
Let's get this board out of my turret.

625
00:54:44.521 --> 00:54:46.940
Sucker.

626
00:54:47.023 --> 00:54:48.733
How am I going to shoot him
the next time he comes around?

627
00:54:48.817 --> 00:54:51.695
Hey, Chef,
make some room back there for the board.

628
00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.492
Sock it to me, Lance.

629
00:55:02.622 --> 00:55:04.165
I wonder if that's the same chopper.

630
00:55:04.249 --> 00:55:07.711
Oh, hell, he's probably got them
all over the river with that recording.

631
00:55:07.794 --> 00:55:09.754
We'll have to hole up here
till dark, Chief.

632
00:55:09.838 --> 00:55:12.132
Don't worry, Lance.
He won't follow us too far.

633
00:55:12.215 --> 00:55:15.051
- What makes you say that?
- You think that big cav colonel

634
00:55:15.135 --> 00:55:17.387
wants everyone upriver
to know we stole his board?

635
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:18.722
I didn't steal it!

636
00:55:21.683 --> 00:55:23.309
- Captain?
- Mmm?

637
00:55:23.393 --> 00:55:26.354
Just how far up this river we going?

638
00:55:26.813 --> 00:55:29.566
It's classified, Chief. I can't tell you.

639
00:55:31.818 --> 00:55:34.070
We're going up pretty far.

640
00:55:35.864 --> 00:55:38.199
Is it gonna be hairy?

641
00:55:38.908 --> 00:55:40.869
I don't know, kid.

642
00:55:41.202 --> 00:55:42.996
Yeah, probably.

643
00:55:43.079 --> 00:55:47.000
You like it like that, Captain,
when it's hot, hairy?

644
00:55:47.083 --> 00:55:49.044
Fuck.

645
00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:03.266
Never get a chance to know what the fuck
you are in some factory in Ohio.

646
00:56:05.852 --> 00:56:08.480
Hey, Chief,
I'm gonna go get those mangoes now, okay?

647
00:56:08.563 --> 00:56:10.648
- Take somebody with you.
- Yeah, I'll take...

648
00:56:10.732 --> 00:56:13.234
I'll go with him.

649
00:56:18.114 --> 00:56:19.574
Chef?

650
00:56:20.116 --> 00:56:22.077
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?

651
00:56:23.036 --> 00:56:25.288
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.

652
00:56:25.371 --> 00:56:28.917
- Because you like mangos and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.

653
00:56:30.085 --> 00:56:33.379
- I'm a saucier.
- Saucier?

654
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:40.261
Yes, sir. See, I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier,

655
00:56:40.345 --> 00:56:41.930
a great saucier.

656
00:56:42.555 --> 00:56:45.934
- What's a saucier?
- You specialize in sauces.

657
00:56:49.938 --> 00:56:52.524
Gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.

658
00:56:59.072 --> 00:57:03.535
Then I was supposed to go to Paris,
study at the Escoffier School.

659
00:57:04.744 --> 00:57:07.872
But then I got orders for my physical.

660
00:57:21.159 --> 00:57:24.246
Hell, I joined the Navy.
Heard they had better food.

661
00:57:25.622 --> 00:57:27.624
A cook school, that did it.

662
00:57:28.166 --> 00:57:31.670
- Oh, yeah? How's that?
- You don't want to hear about that.

663
00:57:34.881 --> 00:57:38.051
They lined us up in front
of 100 yards of prime rib.

664
00:57:38.885 --> 00:57:41.429
All of us lined up, looking at it.

665
00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:46.685
Magnificent meat, really.
Beautifully marbled.

666
00:57:47.352 --> 00:57:48.687
Magnifique.

667
00:57:49.229 --> 00:57:52.315
Next thing, they're throwing
the meat into these big cauldrons.

668
00:57:52.941 --> 00:57:54.943
All of it, boiling it.

669
00:57:56.319 --> 00:57:59.114
I looked inside, man. It was turning gray.

670
00:58:00.365 --> 00:58:02.242
I couldn't fucking believe that one.

671
00:58:03.118 --> 00:58:06.329
That's when I applied for radioman school,
but then they gave me the...

672
00:58:48.538 --> 00:58:49.914
What is it?

673
00:58:52.042 --> 00:58:53.251
Charlie?

674
00:59:04.429 --> 00:59:05.847
It's a tiger!

675
00:59:09.267 --> 00:59:11.436
Tiger, man! It's a tiger!

676
00:59:12.604 --> 00:59:13.855
Battle stations. Lance, up front!

677
00:59:13.938 --> 00:59:15.357
- On the .60, Clean!
- Got it, man.

678
00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.566
Holy shit.

679
00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:20.111
- Chef, come on!
- Fucking tiger!

680
00:59:20.278 --> 00:59:22.405
- Captain, come on!
- What's happening?

681
00:59:23.573 --> 00:59:24.949
- Let's go!
- Tiger!

682
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:28.203
Chief, you were right.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

683
00:59:28.286 --> 00:59:31.414
- Bring that .60 forward!
- Never get out of the boat!

684
00:59:31.498 --> 00:59:36.461
Never get out of the boat! I gotta
remember. Never get out of the boat.

685
00:59:39.089 --> 00:59:42.217
- What happened? How many is it?
- A fucking tiger!

686
00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:43.927
- What?
- A fucking tiger!

687
00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:46.721
- Tiger?
- Yes! I've had it!

688
00:59:46.805 --> 00:59:50.308
I've had the whole goddamn fucking shit,
man!

689
00:59:50.392 --> 00:59:55.063
You can kiss my ass on the county square,
because I'm fucking bugging out.

690
00:59:55.146 --> 00:59:59.401
I didn't come here for this.
I don't fucking need it! I don't want it.

691
00:59:59.901 --> 01:00:03.321
I didn't get out of the goddamn
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

692
01:00:04.406 --> 01:00:06.366
All I wanted to do was fucking cook!

693
01:00:06.449 --> 01:00:09.202
I just wanted
to learn to fucking cook, man!

694
01:00:09.285 --> 01:00:13.081
- It's all right. It's all right.
- What happened, bro?

695
01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:17.043
You're all right.
You're gonna be all right.

696
01:00:17.127 --> 01:00:19.546
- All right. It's all right.
- You're all right.

697
01:00:19.629 --> 01:00:23.174
It's gonna be all right.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

698
01:00:23.258 --> 01:00:28.138
Never get out of the fucking boat.
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Good-bye!

699
01:00:30.056 --> 01:00:32.142
Never get out of the boat.

700
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.686
Absolutely goddamn right.

701
01:00:36.479 --> 01:00:38.857
Unless you were going all the way.

702
01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:45.989
Kurtz got off the boat.

703
01:00:47.699 --> 01:00:49.909
He split from the whole fucking program.

704
01:00:53.371 --> 01:00:54.831
How did that happen?

705
01:00:55.999 --> 01:00:58.168
What did he see here that first tour?

706
01:01:05.341 --> 01:01:07.135
Thirty-eight fucking years old.

707
01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:12.932
If you joined the Green Berets, there
was no way you'd ever get above colonel.

708
01:01:14.184 --> 01:01:16.227
Kurtz knew what he was giving up.

709
01:01:18.146 --> 01:01:22.192
And the more I read and began
to understand, the more I admired him.

710
01:01:23.818 --> 01:01:26.362
His family and friends
couldn't understand it,

711
01:01:26.446 --> 01:01:28.031
and they couldn't talk him out of it.

712
01:01:30.366 --> 01:01:33.787
He had to apply three times
and he put up with a ton of shit.

713
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:36.915
But when he threatened to resign,
they gave it to him.

714
01:01:41.127 --> 01:01:44.380
The next youngest guy
in his class was half his age.

715
01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.009
They must have thought
he was some far-out old man,

716
01:01:48.092 --> 01:01:49.928
humping it over that course.

717
01:01:51.054 --> 01:01:54.265
I did it when I was 19
and it damn near wasted me.

718
01:01:57.185 --> 01:01:58.937
A tough motherfucker.

719
01:02:00.772 --> 01:02:01.940
He finished it.

720
01:02:04.984 --> 01:02:06.736
He could have gone for General...

721
01:02:08.363 --> 01:02:10.281
but he went for himself instead.

722
01:02:13.701 --> 01:02:15.245
"Dear Eva,

723
01:02:15.745 --> 01:02:21.125
today was really a new one.
Almost got eaten alive by a fucking tiger.

724
01:02:23.545 --> 01:02:25.839
Really un-fucking-believable, you know?

725
01:02:25.922 --> 01:02:28.716
We're taking this guy, Captain Willard,
up the river,

726
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.635
but he hasn't told us
yet where we're taking him."

727
01:02:34.722 --> 01:02:37.559
"Thought you might have heard by
now from Elwood. I'll be coming home..."

728
01:02:37.642 --> 01:02:39.811
October 1967,

729
01:02:39.894 --> 01:02:43.106
on special assignment, Kon Tum Province,
Il Corps.

730
01:02:43.189 --> 01:02:46.609
Kurtz staged Operation Archangel!
with combined local forces,

731
01:02:47.235 --> 01:02:49.112
rated a major success.

732
01:02:52.824 --> 01:02:56.828
He received no official clearance.
He just thought it up and did it.

733
01:02:59.372 --> 01:03:00.748
What balls.

734
01:03:02.834 --> 01:03:05.837
They were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one.

735
01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.632
But after the press got a hold of it,
they promoted him to full colonel instead.

736
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:13.803
Oh, man,

737
01:03:14.596 --> 01:03:17.265
the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam,

738
01:03:17.348 --> 01:03:19.183
you needed wings to stay above it.

739
01:03:48.129 --> 01:03:51.382
This sure enough is a bizarre
sight in the middle of this shit.

740
01:03:53.009 --> 01:03:54.552
Expecting us this time?

741
01:03:56.888 --> 01:03:58.431
Damned if I know.

742
01:04:03.937 --> 01:04:07.190
- Hello. Hello...
- Jesus.

743
01:04:14.008 --> 01:04:16.010
Everything goes
back up into the truck.

744
01:04:16.093 --> 01:04:17.094
What?

745
01:04:17.178 --> 01:04:18.805
We gotta get all that stuff up.

746
01:04:25.937 --> 01:04:27.730
Hau Phat.
You ever been up here before, Chef?

747
01:04:27.814 --> 01:04:29.982
- Let's go!
- Ibet you we can score up here.

748
01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:32.568
Yo, man, check out the bikes,
Lance.

749
01:04:33.653 --> 01:04:36.364
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!

750
01:04:36.447 --> 01:04:38.825
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, sukiyaki.

751
01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:41.285
Yeah, man. This is something.

752
01:04:44.455 --> 01:04:45.456
Please!

753
01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.792
- This must be the guy.
- Right over there.

754
01:04:49.168 --> 01:04:51.629
Sergeant. Sergeant?

755
01:04:58.162 --> 01:05:00.414
Three drums of diesel fuel, PBR 5.

756
01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:04.126
Come on, man! Move! We don't have time.
One hour. That's all. What do you want?

757
01:05:04.209 --> 01:05:05.669
Can I get some Panama Red with it?

758
01:05:05.753 --> 01:05:08.464
Panama Red. Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

759
01:05:08.547 --> 01:05:11.008
- Sergeant?
- Destination?

760
01:05:11.091 --> 01:05:12.968
- I don't have no destination.
- I can't do a goddamn thing

761
01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:14.845
without a destination.
You got a destination?

762
01:05:14.928 --> 01:05:16.013
- Sergeant.
- I need diesel fuel.

763
01:05:16.096 --> 01:05:18.140
All right. You got
a destination? I need a destination.

764
01:05:18.223 --> 01:05:19.892
I can't do a goddamn
thing without a destination.

765
01:05:19.975 --> 01:05:22.060
Hey, Sarge, these guys are with me.

766
01:05:22.144 --> 01:05:23.270
Destination's classified.

767
01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:25.856
I carry priority papers from
COMSEC Intelligence, Il Corps.

768
01:05:25.939 --> 01:05:28.942
Okay, right, sir.
Hey, listen, it's a real big night.

769
01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:30.360
Eight bucks for that...

770
01:05:32.488 --> 01:05:34.281
All right. Damn.

771
01:05:35.282 --> 01:05:38.035
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.

772
01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:41.455
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.

773
01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:44.917
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.

774
01:05:46.126 --> 01:05:49.046
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk and you got it.

775
01:05:49.129 --> 01:05:52.466
Hey, listen, would you guys like some
seats, some press box seats for the show?

776
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:55.427
You want those? The show, man.
The show out here.

777
01:05:55.969 --> 01:05:58.263
- Bunnies.
- Playboy bunnies?

778
01:05:58.347 --> 01:06:00.140
You got it. You gonna be here?

779
01:06:00.224 --> 01:06:01.642
Hey, listen, Captain,

780
01:06:02.518 --> 01:06:04.895
on the house. No hard feelings, huh?

781
01:06:42.516 --> 01:06:43.892
How you doing out there?

782
01:06:45.143 --> 01:06:47.688
I said, "How you doing out there?"

783
01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:51.692
Want to say hello to you from all of us
up here to all of you out there

784
01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:54.987
who worked so goddamn hard
in Operation Brute Force!

785
01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:57.781
Hello, all you paratroopers out there!

786
01:06:58.448 --> 01:07:01.410
And the Marines! And the sailors!

787
01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:04.371
We want to let you know
that we're proud of you!

788
01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:06.206
"Cause we know how tough
and how hard it's been.

789
01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:08.125
Yeah!

790
01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:11.837
And to prove it, we're gonna give you some
entertainment we know you're gonna like.

791
01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:15.007
Miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty.

792
01:07:17.175 --> 01:07:21.471
Miss May, Miss Terry Teray! Yeah!

793
01:07:22.014 --> 01:07:26.977
And the Playmate of the Year,
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!

794
01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:20.530
What's the matter?

795
01:08:20.614 --> 01:08:23.200
They've got them here tonight!

796
01:08:29.581 --> 01:08:31.041
Grease my gun!

797
01:08:39.383 --> 01:08:41.343
I'm ready to bow-wow, baby!

798
01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.445
You're cute. I like you.

799
01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:03.490
I'm here, baby! I'm here!

800
01:09:05.617 --> 01:09:06.702
Oh, my God...

801
01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:09.496
Yeah!

802
01:09:10.163 --> 01:09:13.125
- You fucking bitch!
- Take it off!

803
01:09:16.628 --> 01:09:19.006
Hey, lover!
You want us to come over?

804
01:09:19.548 --> 01:09:23.427
- I sure do!
- Sign my centerfold!

805
01:09:25.095 --> 01:09:27.055
Sign my centerfold!

806
01:09:28.015 --> 01:09:30.308
Come on, baby!
Come up here now.

807
01:09:30.392 --> 01:09:32.561
Get your goddamn hands off of my girl!

808
01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:45.073
Start her up.

809
01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.163
Come on!

810
01:09:54.249 --> 01:09:55.584
Will you sign these?

811
01:09:56.418 --> 01:09:58.086
Girls! Let's go!

812
01:10:16.938 --> 01:10:18.190
So long!

813
01:11:01.108 --> 01:11:03.693
Charlie didn't get much USO.

814
01:11:05.153 --> 01:11:07.906
He was dug in too deep or moving too fast.

815
01:11:12.577 --> 01:11:16.373
His idea of great R&R was
cold rice and a little rat meat.

816
01:11:18.973 --> 01:11:20.516
He had only two ways home...

817
01:11:21.934 --> 01:11:24.729
death or victory.

818
01:11:36.449 --> 01:11:39.410
No wonder Kurtz put
a weed up Command's ass.

819
01:11:40.953 --> 01:11:43.748
The war was being run
by a bunch of four-star clowns

820
01:11:43.831 --> 01:11:46.084
who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away.

821
01:11:49.087 --> 01:11:51.798
Man, that was far fucking out.

822
01:11:51.881 --> 01:11:55.343
I collected every picture of her
since she was Miss December, Chief.

823
01:11:55.426 --> 01:11:58.388
Hey, Clean, look at that.
She was here, man.

824
01:11:58.471 --> 01:12:01.349
I even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.

825
01:12:01.432 --> 01:12:03.684
You can really get hung
up on these broads, man,

826
01:12:03.768 --> 01:12:05.395
just like that cat in the delta.

827
01:12:05.478 --> 01:12:07.480
- Yeah, you better believe it.
- What cat?

828
01:12:07.563 --> 01:12:10.691
The one that went up for murder.
He was an Army sergeant.

829
01:12:10.775 --> 01:12:14.404
Remember? This cat, man,
he really dug his Playboy, man.

830
01:12:14.487 --> 01:12:20.159
I mean, this cat, when the thing arrived,
he was there to meet it, man.

831
01:12:20.243 --> 01:12:22.954
Look at these beautiful fucking jugs, man!

832
01:12:24.122 --> 01:12:26.457
Yeah. So anyway,
he was working ARVN patrols, you know,

833
01:12:26.541 --> 01:12:30.086
had one of them cocky gook
asshole lieutenants and shit.

834
01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:33.256
And one day, the gook took his magazine
from him and wouldn't give it back to him.

835
01:12:33.339 --> 01:12:36.551
He said, "Give me my magazine back."
Gook said,

836
01:12:36.634 --> 01:12:39.971
"You shut up. I have you court-martial.”

837
01:12:40.054 --> 01:12:42.140
- Typical fucking ARVN.
- Yeah.

838
01:12:42.223 --> 01:12:46.227
- So then the gook starts to go too far.
- Chef, take the wheel.

839
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:50.314
This dude started to stick
pinholes in the lady's titties.

840
01:12:50.398 --> 01:12:52.066
Take the wheel.

841
01:12:52.150 --> 01:12:53.609
He started sticking pinholes

842
01:12:53.693 --> 01:12:56.404
and mutilating the centerfold
and all kinds of shit like that.

843
01:12:56.487 --> 01:12:59.490
And the sergeant said,
"You better not do that to her.

844
01:12:59.574 --> 01:13:01.909
You leave your shitty little
gook hands off of that girl.

845
01:13:01.993 --> 01:13:03.578
Don't do her like that," right?

846
01:13:03.661 --> 01:13:08.499
- Gook say, "Fuck you,” in Vietnamese.
- Damn.

847
01:13:09.167 --> 01:13:11.752
The sergeant, man,
he just couldn't handle it no more.

848
01:13:11.836 --> 01:13:17.091
He just picked up his iron,
flipped it to rock 'n' roll and...

849
01:13:18.342 --> 01:13:21.637
Gave that little zero a long
burst straight through the Playboy mag

850
01:13:21.721 --> 01:13:24.390
and blew his ass clean off of the dock.

851
01:13:24.474 --> 01:13:29.395
There wasn't no more lieutenant that day.
That was it for his ass.

852
01:13:30.396 --> 01:13:34.233
- They burn him for it?
- The sergeant? Yeah, man.

853
01:13:34.317 --> 01:13:36.277
They stuck his ass in the LBJ.

854
01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.281
It's too bad he didn't
get no medals or nothing.

855
01:13:42.867 --> 01:13:46.662
Fucking ARVN, man.
They should have killed the fuck.

856
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:50.708
Should have given the
fucker a Silver Star.

857
01:13:51.876 --> 01:13:54.212
Bummer for the gook, though, ain't it?

858
01:14:00.092 --> 01:14:03.804
Good morning, Vietnam.
I'm Army Specialist Zack Johnson on AFVN.

859
01:14:03.888 --> 01:14:07.517
It's about 82 degrees in downtown
Saigon right now, also very humid.

860
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.894
And we have an
important message for all Gis

861
01:14:09.977 --> 01:14:12.313
who are living off base
from the Mayor of Saigon.

862
01:14:12.396 --> 01:14:13.397
Yeah!

863
01:14:13.481 --> 01:14:16.400
He'd like you to hang your laundry up
indoors instead of on the windowsills.

864
01:14:16.484 --> 01:14:19.403
The Mayor wants you to
keep Saigon beautiful.

865
01:14:19.737 --> 01:14:22.323
And now, here's another blast
from the past going out to big Sam

866
01:14:22.406 --> 01:14:26.369
who's all alone out there with
the First Battalion, 35th Infantry,

867
01:14:26.452 --> 01:14:29.497
and dedicated by the fire team
at An Khe to their groovy CO...

868
01:14:30.873 --> 01:14:34.293
- The Rolling Stones, Satisfaction.
- Ooh! All right!

869
01:14:35.461 --> 01:14:37.755
Work out, Clean!

870
01:14:37.838 --> 01:14:40.258
Get down, Bubba!

871
01:14:49.225 --> 01:14:51.102
Hang on, Lance!

872
01:14:57.817 --> 01:15:00.111
Get down, Bubba!

873
01:15:08.536 --> 01:15:10.997
Yeah!

874
01:15:19.297 --> 01:15:22.300
I see you is right on target.

875
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:27.221
Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

876
01:15:27.305 --> 01:15:29.307
All right!

877
01:15:29.432 --> 01:15:30.725
Look out, Lance!

878
01:15:32.727 --> 01:15:34.854
Sayonara!

879
01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:40.943
"Commitment and Counter-Insurgency,

880
01:15:41.027 --> 01:15:43.446
by Colonel Walter E. Kurtz.

881
01:15:44.572 --> 01:15:48.659
As long as our officers and troops
perform tours of duty limited to one year,

882
01:15:48.743 --> 01:15:52.663
they will remain dilettantes
in war and tourists in Vietnam.

883
01:15:54.749 --> 01:15:57.585
As long as cold beer, hot food,
rock 'n' roll

884
01:15:57.668 --> 01:16:00.421
and all the other
amenities remain the expected norm,

885
01:16:00.504 --> 01:16:03.799
our conduct of the war
will gain only impotence.

886
01:16:03.883 --> 01:16:05.676
We need fewer men and better.

887
01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.723
If they were committed, this war could be
won with a fourth of our present force."

888
01:16:10.806 --> 01:16:12.183
- Shit.
- Holy shit.

889
01:16:12.266 --> 01:16:15.144
Chicken time. You ain't shitting,
bro. They're motherfucking...

890
01:16:17.772 --> 01:16:20.274
- Who is that?
- What's going on?

891
01:16:22.526 --> 01:16:24.111
Is that you, Lazzaro?

892
01:16:40.336 --> 01:16:43.673
- Fire on the canopy!
- I got it! Get out of there!

893
01:16:44.507 --> 01:16:47.802
Get out! I got it! Yeah! I got it!

894
01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:53.140
- Lance, get down!
- Put that fucker out, man!

895
01:17:00.439 --> 01:17:02.191
What the fuck
they think they're doing?

896
01:17:26.661 --> 01:17:29.789
Late summer, autumn 1968.

897
01:17:30.915 --> 01:17:34.169
Kurtz's patrols in the
highlands coming under frequent ambush.

898
01:17:35.128 --> 01:17:37.130
The camp started falling apart.

899
01:17:43.887 --> 01:17:45.138
November.

900
01:17:45.722 --> 01:17:49.476
Kurtz orders assassination
of three Vietnamese men and one woman.

901
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:54.147
Two of the men were colonels
in the South Vietnamese army.

902
01:17:57.066 --> 01:18:00.945
Enemy activity in his old
sector dropped off to nothing.

903
01:18:03.615 --> 01:18:05.742
Guess he must have hit
the right four people.

904
01:18:08.661 --> 01:18:12.749
He joined the Special Forces.
And after that, his...

905
01:18:14.334 --> 01:18:17.587
The Army tried one last
time to bring him back into the fold.

906
01:18:17.670 --> 01:18:18.713
...methods...

907
01:18:18.796 --> 01:18:21.591
And if he'd pulled over,
it all would have been forgotten.

908
01:18:21.674 --> 01:18:22.717
...unsound.

909
01:18:23.676 --> 01:18:25.053
But he kept going...

910
01:18:25.136 --> 01:18:26.804
Now he's crossed into Cambodia...

911
01:18:26.888 --> 01:18:28.264
...and he
kept winning it his way...

912
01:18:28.348 --> 01:18:30.308
...with this
Montagnard army of his...

913
01:18:30.391 --> 01:18:31.768
...and they called me in.

914
01:18:31.851 --> 01:18:36.814
...man like a god. And follow
every order, however ridiculous.

915
01:18:39.859 --> 01:18:41.110
They lost him.

916
01:18:42.987 --> 01:18:44.197
He was gone.

917
01:18:45.698 --> 01:18:48.409
Nothing but rumors
and random intelligence,

918
01:18:48.493 --> 01:18:50.286
mostly from captured VC.

919
01:18:52.372 --> 01:18:55.708
The VC knew his name by now,
and they were scared of him.

920
01:18:56.876 --> 01:19:00.004
He and his men were playing hit and run,
all the way into Cambodia.

921
01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:08.972
I know where I'm going.
I'm going to the White House

922
01:19:09.055 --> 01:19:13.393
to have dinner with the
President of the United States, baby.

923
01:19:13.476 --> 01:19:14.727
That's where I'm going.

924
01:19:15.853 --> 01:19:17.730
Hey, Chef, put the cover on that.

925
01:19:19.566 --> 01:19:20.733
Clean.

926
01:19:25.029 --> 01:19:28.783
- How long has that kid been on this boat?
- Seven months.

927
01:19:29.867 --> 01:19:32.412
He's really
specializing in busting my balls.

928
01:19:33.246 --> 01:19:35.748
Very possible, Captain,
he thinks the same of you.

929
01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:39.711
Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?

930
01:19:39.794 --> 01:19:41.337
I don't think.

931
01:19:42.088 --> 01:19:45.008
My orders say I'm not supposed to know
where I'm taking this boat, so I don't!

932
01:19:46.175 --> 01:19:49.095
But one look at you, and I know
it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

933
01:20:00.273 --> 01:20:03.818
We're going upriver about 75
klicks above the Do Luong bridge.

934
01:20:08.448 --> 01:20:11.242
- That's Cambodia, Captain.
- That's classified.

935
01:20:12.493 --> 01:20:15.413
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,
but that's where I'm going.

936
01:20:17.457 --> 01:20:21.044
You just get me close to my destination,
and I'll cut you and the crew loose.

937
01:20:24.797 --> 01:20:26.299
All right, Captain.

938
01:20:47.987 --> 01:20:49.447
"Dear Son,

939
01:20:50.365 --> 01:20:52.742
I'm afraid that both you
and your mother will have been worried

940
01:20:52.825 --> 01:20:55.953
at not hearing from me
during the past weeks.

941
01:20:56.037 --> 01:20:59.207
But my situation here
has become a difficult one.

942
01:21:00.041 --> 01:21:02.794
I have been officially
accused of murder by the Army.

943
01:21:10.259 --> 01:21:13.096
The alleged victims were
four Vietnamese double agents.

944
01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.683
We spent months uncovering
them and accumulating evidence.

945
01:21:19.435 --> 01:21:23.356
When absolute proof was completed,
we acted, we acted like soldiers.

946
01:21:24.899 --> 01:21:26.693
The charges are unjustified.

947
01:21:27.485 --> 01:21:29.195
They are, in fact,

948
01:21:29.278 --> 01:21:32.865
and in the circumstances
of this conflict, quite completely insane.

949
01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:47.213
In a war, there are many moments
for compassion and tender action.

950
01:21:48.881 --> 01:21:53.386
There are many moments for ruthless
action, what is often called ruthless,

951
01:21:54.345 --> 01:21:57.098
what may, in many circumstances,
be only clarity.

952
01:21:57.932 --> 01:22:00.226
Seeing clearly what there
is to be done and doing it."”

953
01:22:00.309 --> 01:22:01.352
Medevac, come in.

954
01:22:01.436 --> 01:22:04.147
- "... directly, quickly, awake..."
- Alpha Tango Tango.

955
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:06.441
- Echo Tango Alpha...
- "...looking at it."

956
01:22:06.524 --> 01:22:09.485
...request dust-off.
Three, maybe four KIAs. Over.

957
01:22:09.569 --> 01:22:12.947
"I will trust you to tell your
mother what you choose about this letter.

958
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:16.617
As for the charges against me,
I am unconcerned.”

959
01:22:16.701 --> 01:22:17.702
Medevac, come in.

960
01:22:18.564 --> 01:22:20.607
"I am beyond their timid, lying morality.

961
01:22:20.691 --> 01:22:24.111
- And so I am beyond caring."
- Medevac, do you read? Over.

962
01:22:24.194 --> 01:22:27.573
"You have all my faith.
Your loving father."”

963
01:22:47.926 --> 01:22:49.136
Jesus.

964
01:22:49.219 --> 01:22:52.055
No wonder I couldn't
get them on the radio.

965
01:22:52.139 --> 01:22:54.266
What a dump.

966
01:22:58.187 --> 01:22:59.855
- Hi, there!
- How you doing?

967
01:22:59.938 --> 01:23:03.650
Wow. That's a nice little boat you got
there. Never seen one up here before.

968
01:23:03.734 --> 01:23:07.404
You know, we called in a request
for a medevac. You guys receive it?

969
01:23:07.487 --> 01:23:09.364
Medevac? No.

970
01:23:09.448 --> 01:23:12.910
Yeah, we passed
a downed Huey with some KIAs.

971
01:23:12.993 --> 01:23:15.120
- On your way here?
- Yeah.

972
01:23:15.204 --> 01:23:18.332
- You going up this river?
- Way up.

973
01:23:18.415 --> 01:23:22.586
- Way upriver? Whoa! Forget it.
- Why? Why?

974
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:25.672
Well, we want
to send some people downriver.

975
01:23:25.756 --> 01:23:28.258
- Just forget it.
- What the fuck was that?

976
01:23:28.342 --> 01:23:31.929
- We'll be back in a couple of days.
- Yeah, right, you'll be back.

977
01:23:38.685 --> 01:23:40.771
- Hey, Chief?
- Yeah, Captain?

978
01:23:40.854 --> 01:23:42.606
Why don't you see
what you can do with that engine?

979
01:23:42.689 --> 01:23:44.399
- I'm gonna have a look around.
- All right.

980
01:23:44.483 --> 01:23:46.985
Hey, don't leave without me.

981
01:24:09.132 --> 01:24:13.679
- Hey, soldier, where's your CO?
- Don't ask me, man.

982
01:24:33.991 --> 01:24:36.243
Give me my clothes back, asshole!

983
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:41.665
Asshole!

984
01:24:46.586 --> 01:24:49.506
Hey, guys, where's the CO?

985
01:24:49.798 --> 01:24:52.884
He stepped on a land mine
about two months ago.

986
01:24:52.968 --> 01:24:55.929
- Got all blown to hell.
- Who's in charge here?

987
01:24:56.013 --> 01:24:59.599
Charge? I don't know, man.
I'm just the night man.

988
01:24:59.683 --> 01:25:03.228
Just doing what I'm told.
Shit, I'm just a working girl.

989
01:25:03.312 --> 01:25:04.813
What about you, fella?

990
01:25:06.231 --> 01:25:09.401
Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you
it's gonna jam. You mark my words.

991
01:25:09.484 --> 01:25:11.945
- Keep it in that condition.
- Hey, get off my back. Get off my back.

992
01:25:12.029 --> 01:25:14.323
- No, man, I'm telling you.
- Lay off!

993
01:25:16.199 --> 01:25:19.536
Hey, hey, come here!

994
01:25:19.619 --> 01:25:22.164
Is that your boat? Come on inside.

995
01:25:23.999 --> 01:25:25.208
What do you want?

996
01:25:25.292 --> 01:25:28.795
Come on inside. I want to talk to you.
Come on!

997
01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.091
Get out of the rain.

998
01:25:33.175 --> 01:25:35.052
Get off me!

999
01:25:35.469 --> 01:25:37.596
Come on. Cut this shit.
Hey, Chef. Come on.

1000
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:42.517
Hey, how you doing, Captain?
I want you to meet some people.

1001
01:25:44.311 --> 01:25:48.565
- I got your ass.
- Your ass is shit, Chef. Your ass is shit.

1002
01:25:48.648 --> 01:25:50.567
You're a motherfucker, man.

1003
01:25:54.905 --> 01:25:57.616
What a motherfucker, man!

1004
01:25:58.575 --> 01:26:01.828
Goddamn, my ear, you motherfucker!

1005
01:26:03.622 --> 01:26:07.084
Get him off me, Chef!
You smartass.

1006
01:26:08.418 --> 01:26:10.504
Hey, guys.

1007
01:26:10.754 --> 01:26:12.672
I got you! I got your ass!

1008
01:26:12.756 --> 01:26:15.926
- You ain't shit, Chef.
- Hey, fellas!

1009
01:26:17.803 --> 01:26:20.180
- You pulled my fucking...
- Guys!

1010
01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.767
I just made a deal with
the people from Hau Phat.

1011
01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:28.105
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for
a couple of hours with the bunnies.

1012
01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.155
Captain!

1013
01:26:37.239 --> 01:26:39.783
Hey, hey, you shitting me?

1014
01:26:39.866 --> 01:26:44.913
No, I'm not. Grab a couple of barrels
and get up to that big tent. Come on!

1015
01:26:46.665 --> 01:26:48.667
Captain.

1016
01:26:49.376 --> 01:26:52.170
You're giving away our fuel
for a Playmate of the Month?

1017
01:26:52.254 --> 01:26:55.257
Nope. Playmate of the Year, Chief.

1018
01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:59.803
- Warm them up, baby! Warm them up!
- Warm them up.

1019
01:26:59.886 --> 01:27:02.973
Captain, we get in a firefight
and run out of fuel,

1020
01:27:03.056 --> 01:27:05.559
I want you to tell me how she was.

1021
01:27:05.725 --> 01:27:09.729
I made a deal for all of us, Chief.
How about you?

1022
01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.903
- You got some mamas in there?
- Some what?

1023
01:27:18.905 --> 01:27:22.367
Forget it, Captain.
I'll stay with the boat.

1024
01:27:22.951 --> 01:27:25.787
Hey, Captain, give me a hand.

1025
01:27:46.516 --> 01:27:49.019
I got every one of your pictures.

1026
01:27:49.102 --> 01:27:52.647
I got the centerfold,
the Playmates Review,

1027
01:27:52.731 --> 01:27:57.360
the Playmate of the Year runoff.
I even got the calendar.

1028
01:27:57.444 --> 01:28:00.238
Hey, oiseau.

1029
01:28:00.989 --> 01:28:02.824
Wait, how come you got a bird?

1030
01:28:02.908 --> 01:28:05.702
I used to be the
bird girl at Busch Gardens.

1031
01:28:05.785 --> 01:28:09.206
- Busch Gardens?
- Yeah, I used to train birds there.

1032
01:28:12.626 --> 01:28:15.378
- You are Miss December, aren't you?
- Miss May.

1033
01:28:15.462 --> 01:28:17.088
Is it coming?

1034
01:28:24.012 --> 01:28:27.557
- Miss December has black hair.
- It's over there.

1035
01:28:27.641 --> 01:28:30.685
He's not one of my regular birds.

1036
01:28:31.645 --> 01:28:35.732
Come on. Come on, baby.
Snack? Snatch a crack. Come here.

1037
01:28:35.815 --> 01:28:42.030
Being Playmate of the Year is
the loneliest experience I can imagine.

1038
01:28:43.573 --> 01:28:49.829
It's like you try to
express your feelings to someone

1039
01:28:50.372 --> 01:28:52.207
and show them your heart...

1040
01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:56.044
Yeah, I want to hear about your bird act.
I'd love to hear about your bird act.

1041
01:29:00.715 --> 01:29:04.886
But would you just mind putting
this black wig on for me, please?

1042
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:10.517
And there's this glass wall between you,
this invisible glass,

1043
01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.562
and they can see your mouth moving.

1044
01:29:13.645 --> 01:29:15.939
I used to train birds
for at least two years...

1045
01:29:16.022 --> 01:29:17.274
- That's beautiful, yeah.
- ...at Busch Gardens.

1046
01:29:17.357 --> 01:29:19.609
This was cascading
over your right shoulder,

1047
01:29:19.693 --> 01:29:21.528
and this, this was open here.

1048
01:29:21.611 --> 01:29:24.489
But they can't hear what you're saying.

1049
01:29:24.573 --> 01:29:26.825
I used to train them
to stand on their head

1050
01:29:26.908 --> 01:29:29.160
and fly upside down
and ride little bicycles.

1051
01:29:29.244 --> 01:29:30.954
Your right
hand was kind of over there.

1052
01:29:31.746 --> 01:29:32.872
Hey, Chef!

1053
01:29:32.956 --> 01:29:35.625
Hey, come on, get out of here, man!

1054
01:29:35.709 --> 01:29:37.961
- Later! Later!
- Does he want to talk to you?

1055
01:29:38.044 --> 01:29:39.421
Give me 15 minutes.

1056
01:29:39.504 --> 01:29:43.508
You can never really make them
hear what you're trying to say.

1057
01:29:43.592 --> 01:29:45.385
You okay with kind of bending?

1058
01:29:45.468 --> 01:29:47.345
That's it. Yeah, your ass was
sticking out just a little...

1059
01:29:47.429 --> 01:29:50.807
Hey, man, fuck off! Fifteen minutes!

1060
01:29:51.683 --> 01:29:54.352
That's why I tried so desperately

1061
01:29:55.061 --> 01:29:58.982
to show somebody that I had some talent.

1062
01:29:59.065 --> 01:30:02.694
Little baby macaws.
Have you ever seen a baby macaw?

1063
01:30:02.777 --> 01:30:04.195
- That's kind of...
- They're all blue.

1064
01:30:04.279 --> 01:30:09.200
- Come on, man! Take off, would you?
- Open up! I got my rights, man!

1065
01:30:09.284 --> 01:30:13.413
They make you do things that
you don't want to do. Like...

1066
01:30:13.496 --> 01:30:16.875
Like this picture here.

1067
01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:22.797
I started feeling repulsed with myself.

1068
01:30:23.048 --> 01:30:24.466
You were just kind of bending forward.

1069
01:30:24.549 --> 01:30:26.635
- ...really, really cute.
- Your ass, kind of out a bit.

1070
01:30:26.718 --> 01:30:29.304
- I love training birds.
- That's it.

1071
01:30:29.387 --> 01:30:33.391
That's it. That's it. Voila!

1072
01:30:33.808 --> 01:30:36.895
You're beautiful. I just want to...

1073
01:30:36.978 --> 01:30:40.065
You know, I can't believe it.

1074
01:30:40.148 --> 01:30:44.986
Me, Jay Hicks. I can't
believe I'm really here, you know?

1075
01:30:45.070 --> 01:30:49.199
Maybe I'm unfit to have a relationship

1076
01:30:49.282 --> 01:30:54.204
with a beautiful, innocent boy.

1077
01:30:54.287 --> 01:30:57.707
Just think,
if it hadn't been for the Vietnam War,

1078
01:30:57.791 --> 01:31:01.628
- I never would've met you, Miss December.
- Miss May.

1079
01:31:02.712 --> 01:31:04.172
I wish...

1080
01:31:04.255 --> 01:31:08.968
I wish I could find just one person...

1081
01:31:11.554 --> 01:31:14.474
that could share my point of view.

1082
01:31:20.939 --> 01:31:22.857
Oh, you kiss like a bird!

1083
01:31:22.941 --> 01:31:25.527
Oh, God! Kiss me, kiss me.

1084
01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:27.570
Who is that?

1085
01:31:27.654 --> 01:31:31.241
You're driving me crazy! Kiss me!

1086
01:31:31.324 --> 01:31:33.034
- Oh, my God.
- I love birds!

1087
01:31:38.456 --> 01:31:40.333
You finished yet?

1088
01:31:41.042 --> 01:31:43.420
Holy fuck!

1089
01:31:44.087 --> 01:31:49.759
Make like a bird! Make like a bird!
Fly, baby! Cockatoo me!

1090
01:31:49.843 --> 01:31:52.637
- Fly!
- I can fly like an eagle!

1091
01:31:52.721 --> 01:31:55.265
Fly like an eagle!
It drives me crazy!

1092
01:31:55.348 --> 01:31:57.934
It drives me crazy!

1093
01:32:06.901 --> 01:32:10.697
Lance, that was somebody's son.

1094
01:32:13.199 --> 01:32:17.996
Lance,
there were things that they made me do

1095
01:32:18.079 --> 01:32:19.581
that I didn't want to do.

1096
01:32:19.664 --> 01:32:23.418
They said,
"Pull the ribbons between your legs,"

1097
01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:26.045
and I didn't want to do it,

1098
01:32:26.129 --> 01:32:29.841
but they said that was
what was expected of me,

1099
01:32:29.924 --> 01:32:33.052
that that's what people wanted to see.

1100
01:32:54.407 --> 01:32:58.244
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm next, ma'am.

1101
01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:00.997
Hell,
I didn't know he was a cherry.

1102
01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.875
- Didn't know you never got no pussy.
- Shove it, fuck-up!

1103
01:33:03.958 --> 01:33:07.378
Sure sorry about that. If I had known,
I'd have taken you to New Orleans...

1104
01:33:07.462 --> 01:33:09.798
- Man, fuck you.
- ...Introduce you to cooze, Bubba!

1105
01:33:09.881 --> 01:33:13.635
- Lay off, Chef.
- Cherry boy! Cherry boy!

1106
01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:15.512
You're a fucking dog!

1107
01:33:15.595 --> 01:33:16.763
Come on down to New Orleans, Bubba,

1108
01:33:16.846 --> 01:33:20.308
- and I'll get you fixed up, you prick.
- Lay off, Chef.

1109
01:33:20.391 --> 01:33:22.811
You're the only fucking
prick I see around here.

1110
01:33:22.894 --> 01:33:24.938
If I want to play with a prick,
I'll play with my own!

1111
01:33:25.835 --> 01:33:27.253
- Lay off, Chef!
- What you gonna do with it, cherry boy?

1112
01:33:27.336 --> 01:33:29.797
- Fucking cherry boy!
- Chef, I said lay off!

1113
01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:34.677
Chef, knock it off! Give him a break!
What do you think I said?

1114
01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.387
And give your jaws a rest!

1115
01:33:37.138 --> 01:33:39.807
And this ain't the Army. You are a sailor!

1116
01:33:40.599 --> 01:33:44.562
So get out of that frizzly Army-looking
shirt and stop smoking that dope!

1117
01:33:44.895 --> 01:33:46.731
You hear me?

1118
01:33:50.651 --> 01:33:53.362
Lance,
what's with all the green paint?

1119
01:33:53.446 --> 01:33:55.865
- Camouflage.
- How's that?

1120
01:33:55.948 --> 01:33:57.450
So they can't see you.
They're everywhere, Chief.

1121
01:33:57.783 --> 01:34:01.579
Uh-huh. I want you to stay awake up there,
man. You got a job to do.

1122
01:34:20.556 --> 01:34:24.101
Sampan off the port bow. Sampan
off the port bow. Let's take a look.

1123
01:34:24.769 --> 01:34:26.270
Lance. Bring them in.

1124
01:34:26.353 --> 01:34:28.481
Clean, on the .60. Chef, get a .16.

1125
01:34:29.815 --> 01:34:31.525
Clean, get on that .60!

1126
01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:36.113
What's up, Chief?

1127
01:34:38.199 --> 01:34:41.452
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

1128
01:34:41.535 --> 01:34:43.704
Well,
let's forget routine now and let them go.

1129
01:34:43.788 --> 01:34:46.332
These boats are running
supplies in this delta, Captain.

1130
01:34:46.415 --> 01:34:47.541
I'm gonna take a look.

1131
01:34:49.210 --> 01:34:50.795
Chief, my mission's got priority here.

1132
01:34:50.878 --> 01:34:53.339
Hell, you wouldn't even be in this
part of the river if it wasn't for me.

1133
01:34:54.381 --> 01:34:57.468
Until we reach your destination, Captain,
you're just on for the ride.

1134
01:34:58.344 --> 01:35:01.430
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on, throw the rope, asshole.

1135
01:35:01.514 --> 01:35:03.724
All right. Come on.
Let's bring it over.

1136
01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:19.907
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

1137
01:35:26.956 --> 01:35:29.625
Come on! Hurry up, motherfucker!
Move it!

1138
01:35:32.294 --> 01:35:34.505
- You two, come on.
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.

1139
01:35:34.588 --> 01:35:35.631
I got you, Chief.

1140
01:35:40.302 --> 01:35:41.428
It's clear, Chief.

1141
01:35:47.935 --> 01:35:51.146
Okay, that's them.
That's them. They're okay.

1142
01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:52.773
Board and search it.

1143
01:35:53.858 --> 01:35:55.609
It's just a fucking boat.
There ain't nothing on it, Chief.

1144
01:35:55.693 --> 01:35:56.986
Board it and search it.

1145
01:35:57.069 --> 01:35:59.655
Just some baskets and some ducks,
fucking bananas.

1146
01:35:59.738 --> 01:36:01.240
Ain't nothing on it.
Don't be ashamed, Chef.

1147
01:36:01.323 --> 01:36:02.700
What's wrong with you?
Go on and search it.

1148
01:36:02.783 --> 01:36:04.910
There's a goat and some fish.

1149
01:36:05.703 --> 01:36:07.121
- Chef!
- Bunch of fucking vegetables.

1150
01:36:07.204 --> 01:36:09.456
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothing on it, man!

1151
01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:11.083
- Get on it!
- All right!

1152
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:15.254
Move it, asshole! Goddamn it!
Just some pigs.

1153
01:36:15.337 --> 01:36:16.755
Look, mangos.

1154
01:36:16.839 --> 01:36:18.841
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fucking rice!

1155
01:36:18.924 --> 01:36:21.552
- Look in there, Chef. Look in it.
- Some fucking fish.

1156
01:36:22.636 --> 01:36:25.556
More coconuts. Rice. Here's rice.

1157
01:36:26.974 --> 01:36:28.309
What's in that vegetable basket?

1158
01:36:28.934 --> 01:36:31.687
Get out of here! Come on!
Get over there, Goddamn it.

1159
01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:33.814
Check that vegetable basket.

1160
01:36:33.898 --> 01:36:35.190
- All right!
- Shut up, slope!

1161
01:36:35.274 --> 01:36:37.192
- There ain't nothing in here.
- What's in the boxes?

1162
01:36:37.276 --> 01:36:38.319
Not a fucking thing.

1163
01:36:38.402 --> 01:36:39.737
- Look in that tin can.
- Nothing.

1164
01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:42.197
- That rusty can.
- Just fucking rice, that's all!

1165
01:36:42.281 --> 01:36:43.532
- There ain't nothing on it!
- Check the yellow can.

1166
01:36:43.616 --> 01:36:45.826
Check the yellow can!
She was sitting on it. What's in it?

1167
01:36:50.331 --> 01:36:51.707
Chef!

1168
01:36:56.128 --> 01:36:57.546
Motherfuckers!

1169
01:37:06.472 --> 01:37:08.974
- Hold it!
- Come on, let's kill them all!

1170
01:37:09.058 --> 01:37:11.685
- Fucking cock sucking mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!

1171
01:37:11.769 --> 01:37:14.396
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit out of all of them.

1172
01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.650
- Chef, hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.

1173
01:37:18.609 --> 01:37:20.736
Why the fuck not?

1174
01:37:22.196 --> 01:37:23.781
- Clean?
- I'm good.

1175
01:37:32.331 --> 01:37:34.750
- You okay, Lance?
- Shit! Fuck! Shit!

1176
01:37:34.833 --> 01:37:37.086
- Chef!
- Look what she was hiding, huh?

1177
01:37:37.169 --> 01:37:39.755
- You all right?
- See what she was running for?

1178
01:37:43.759 --> 01:37:45.552
It's a fucking puppy.

1179
01:37:46.971 --> 01:37:47.972
It's a fucking puppy.

1180
01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:51.433
Give me that dog!

1181
01:37:51.517 --> 01:37:53.352
- No, you're not gonna get it!
- Fucking give it to me!

1182
01:37:53.435 --> 01:37:55.604
Give me the fucking dog, asshole!

1183
01:37:55.688 --> 01:37:56.897
Fuck you!

1184
01:37:57.856 --> 01:37:59.900
- Chef.
- Fucking mango, too!

1185
01:37:59.984 --> 01:38:00.985
You want that?

1186
01:38:01.068 --> 01:38:03.195
Chef, she's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

1187
01:38:04.196 --> 01:38:05.322
- Chef!
- Yes!

1188
01:38:05.406 --> 01:38:07.116
She's moving behind you. Check her out!

1189
01:38:07.199 --> 01:38:08.867
All right. All right.

1190
01:38:09.410 --> 01:38:11.286
Come on, Clean, Goddamn it.
Give me a hand.

1191
01:38:11.370 --> 01:38:13.247
She's not dead, she's wounded.
Clean, give him a hand.

1192
01:38:14.081 --> 01:38:17.710
Just take it easy. Take it easy.
Slow down and take it easy.

1193
01:38:18.293 --> 01:38:20.295
All right, Chef,
just wait a minute. Wait a minute, Chef.

1194
01:38:20.379 --> 01:38:21.839
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing, Chef?

1195
01:38:21.922 --> 01:38:25.467
- She's hurt. She's bleeding.
- Oh, man.

1196
01:38:25.551 --> 01:38:28.512
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.

1197
01:38:28.595 --> 01:38:30.014
What are you talking about?

1198
01:38:30.097 --> 01:38:31.473
We're taking her to some friendlies,
Captain.

1199
01:38:31.557 --> 01:38:33.058
She's wounded, she's not dead.

1200
01:38:33.559 --> 01:38:35.310
- Get out of there, Chef.
- The book says, Captain...

1201
01:38:46.864 --> 01:38:49.199
Fuck you. Fuck him.

1202
01:38:49.908 --> 01:38:51.577
I told you not to stop.
Now let's go.

1203
01:39:52.816 --> 01:39:55.610
It was the way we had
over here of living with ourselves.

1204
01:39:56.986 --> 01:39:59.906
We'd cut them in half with a machine gun
and give them a Band-Aid.

1205
01:40:02.492 --> 01:40:03.993
It was a lie,

1206
01:40:04.828 --> 01:40:06.579
and the more I saw of them...

1207
01:40:07.622 --> 01:40:09.416
the more I hated lies.

1208
01:40:11.835 --> 01:40:15.839
Those boys were never gonna
look at me the same way again.

1209
01:40:16.548 --> 01:40:19.134
But I felt like I knew one
or two things about Kurtz

1210
01:40:19.217 --> 01:40:21.428
that weren't in the dossier.

1211
01:40:26.493 --> 01:40:30.580
Do Luong bridge was the last
Army outpost on the Nung River.

1212
01:40:34.918 --> 01:40:37.253
Beyond that, there was only Kurtz.

1213
01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:43.009
Lance! Hey, Lance, what do you think?

1214
01:40:43.593 --> 01:40:44.636
It's beautiful.

1215
01:40:45.887 --> 01:40:49.224
Huh? I mean, what's the matter with you?
You're acting kind of weird.

1216
01:40:50.475 --> 01:40:53.394
Hey, you know that last
tab of acid I was saving?

1217
01:40:53.478 --> 01:40:56.064
- Yeah.
- I dropped it.

1218
01:40:56.147 --> 01:40:58.900
You dropped acid? Far out.

1219
01:41:10.745 --> 01:41:13.998
- Take me home!
- God damn you!

1220
01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:28.054
God damn!
You'll get what you deserve!

1221
01:41:36.271 --> 01:41:39.023
Is there a Captain Willard on board?

1222
01:41:39.107 --> 01:41:40.483
- Yeah!
- Captain Willard?

1223
01:41:40.567 --> 01:41:43.570
- Yeah, who's that?
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.

1224
01:41:43.653 --> 01:41:44.696
Get that light off me.

1225
01:41:46.698 --> 01:41:49.534
I was sent here from Nha Trang
with these three days ago, sir.

1226
01:41:49.617 --> 01:41:52.787
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

1227
01:41:53.246 --> 01:41:55.039
You don't know how happy
this makes me, sir.

1228
01:41:55.123 --> 01:41:56.791
- Why?
- Now I can get out of here,

1229
01:41:56.874 --> 01:41:58.209
if I can find a way.

1230
01:42:02.463 --> 01:42:05.174
You're in the asshole
of the world, Captain!

1231
01:42:09.929 --> 01:42:11.723
Captain, where you going?

1232
01:42:11.806 --> 01:42:14.475
See if I can find some fuel,
get some information.

1233
01:42:15.977 --> 01:42:19.897
- Pick me up the other side of the bridge.
- Somebody go with him. Chef!

1234
01:42:19.981 --> 01:42:22.817
I'll go. I wanna go.

1235
01:42:37.624 --> 01:42:39.375
You get your ass in gear.

1236
01:43:15.036 --> 01:43:18.289
Come on, man.
Listen to the music, man.

1237
01:43:18.748 --> 01:43:20.166
Where can I find the CO?

1238
01:43:20.249 --> 01:43:22.627
You came right to it,
son of a bitch!

1239
01:43:22.710 --> 01:43:26.047
Lance! Get down here!

1240
01:43:28.883 --> 01:43:31.010
You still got a Commanding Officer here?

1241
01:43:31.844 --> 01:43:34.555
- Beverly Hills.
- What?

1242
01:43:34.639 --> 01:43:39.435
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills.

1243
01:43:39.519 --> 01:43:42.105
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

1244
01:44:17.265 --> 01:44:19.058
Goddamn I,
you stepped in my face!

1245
01:44:19.142 --> 01:44:21.436
- We thought you were dead.
- Well, you thought wrong, damn it.

1246
01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:28.025
I told you to stop fucking with me,
didn't I?

1247
01:44:28.109 --> 01:44:29.902
You think you're so bad, huh, nigga?

1248
01:44:30.445 --> 01:44:31.821
What are you shooting at, soldier?

1249
01:44:31.904 --> 01:44:34.449
Gooks.
What the fuck you think I'm shooting at?

1250
01:44:35.074 --> 01:44:37.285
I'm sorry, sir.
There are gooks out there by the wire,

1251
01:44:37.368 --> 01:44:41.122
- but I think I killed them all.
- You ain't shot shit, man. Listen!

1252
01:44:42.707 --> 01:44:45.960
Oh, shit, he's trying to call his friends,
man. Send up a flare.

1253
01:44:54.427 --> 01:44:56.763
You think you're so bad, nigga?
You think you bad, huh?

1254
01:44:56.846 --> 01:45:00.641
They're all dead, stupid. There's
one still alive underneath them bodies.

1255
01:45:01.142 --> 01:45:03.728
Who's the Commanding Officer here?

1256
01:45:03.811 --> 01:45:05.146
Ain't you?

1257
01:45:07.315 --> 01:45:08.608
You think you're so bad, huh?

1258
01:45:08.691 --> 01:45:11.194
I got something for your ass now, nigga!

1259
01:45:11.277 --> 01:45:13.321
I got something for you now!

1260
01:45:15.281 --> 01:45:16.991
He's underneath the bodies, man.

1261
01:45:18.743 --> 01:45:21.245
- Go get the roach, man.
- Go get the roach, man.

1262
01:45:21.329 --> 01:45:24.791
- Go get the roach, nigga!
- I'm gonna go get the roach.

1263
01:45:29.128 --> 01:45:32.715
Roach. Roach. Roach.

1264
01:45:33.508 --> 01:45:36.385
Got slopes on the wire, man.
Do you hear them?

1265
01:45:36.469 --> 01:45:38.471
- Lance!
- Do you hear them?

1266
01:45:43.684 --> 01:45:45.144
Go bust them!

1267
01:45:48.064 --> 01:45:51.025
Hey, GI, fuck you!

1268
01:46:00.451 --> 01:46:02.703
You hear him out there on the wire, man?

1269
01:46:03.538 --> 01:46:06.833
- Yeah.
- I'll kill you, Gl!

1270
01:46:06.916 --> 01:46:08.000
You need a flare?

1271
01:46:10.002 --> 01:46:11.254
No.

1272
01:46:12.630 --> 01:46:14.465
He's close, man.

1273
01:46:15.174 --> 01:46:17.051
He's real close.

1274
01:46:38.906 --> 01:46:41.242
Gl, fuck you!

1275
01:46:44.412 --> 01:46:45.580
Gl, fuck you!

1276
01:46:51.502 --> 01:46:52.962
Motherfucker.

1277
01:46:54.088 --> 01:46:56.007
Hey, soldier...

1278
01:46:59.969 --> 01:47:01.929
do you know who's in command here?

1279
01:47:04.724 --> 01:47:05.808
Yeah.

1280
01:47:20.197 --> 01:47:22.199
Holy shit!

1281
01:47:26.954 --> 01:47:30.249
Yo, Chief, man,
two guys just got blown off that bridge.

1282
01:47:30.333 --> 01:47:32.877
You hang on, man. You're gonna be okay.

1283
01:47:37.131 --> 01:47:38.966
- What's that?
- Mail, man.

1284
01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:41.302
Later on the mail! Watch them trees.

1285
01:47:44.055 --> 01:47:46.641
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1286
01:47:46.724 --> 01:47:48.309
Let's move out.

1287
01:47:48.392 --> 01:47:52.939
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fucking CO here.

1288
01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:58.110
- Let's just get going.
- Which way, Captain?

1289
01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.202
You know which way, Chief.

1290
01:48:06.994 --> 01:48:08.788
You're on your own, Captain.

1291
01:48:10.206 --> 01:48:11.499
Do you wanna go on?

1292
01:48:11.999 --> 01:48:16.212
Like this bridge, we build it every night,
Charlie blows it right back up again

1293
01:48:16.295 --> 01:48:18.965
just so the generals
can say the road's open.

1294
01:48:19.507 --> 01:48:21.008
Think about it.

1295
01:48:24.095 --> 01:48:26.514
- Who cares?
- Just get us upriver!

1296
01:48:31.018 --> 01:48:33.396
Chef, on the bow.

1297
01:48:34.563 --> 01:48:36.440
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go.

1298
01:49:33.230 --> 01:49:34.856
Whose package is that?

1299
01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:39.361
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit. Wait a minute, is that it?

1300
01:49:39.736 --> 01:49:40.695
- That's it for you.
- Lance!

1301
01:49:42.011 --> 01:49:44.305
<i>Mr. LB. Johnson, there you go.</i>

1302
01:49:45.849 --> 01:49:48.810
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waiting for this one.

1303
01:49:48.893 --> 01:49:52.355
I got another one,
got a box from Eva.

1304
01:49:52.439 --> 01:49:55.275
"Lance, I'm fine. I'm fine, Lance.

1305
01:49:55.358 --> 01:49:58.987
Sue and I went tripping to Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."

1306
01:49:59.070 --> 01:50:02.323
- I want to get back to Antoine's.
- "I remember the time we went..."

1307
01:50:02.407 --> 01:50:04.993
How could I fucking forget, man?
Beautiful.

1308
01:50:06.077 --> 01:50:08.621
"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?

1309
01:50:08.705 --> 01:50:09.956
Let me know."

1310
01:50:10.039 --> 01:50:13.501
Jim, it's here. It really is here.

1311
01:50:17.881 --> 01:50:20.341
"There has been a new
development regarding your mission

1312
01:50:20.425 --> 01:50:22.802
which we must now communicate to you.

1313
01:50:22.886 --> 01:50:24.929
Months ago,
a man was ordered on a mission

1314
01:50:25.013 --> 01:50:26.681
which was identical to yours.

1315
01:50:27.223 --> 01:50:30.852
We have reason to believe that he
is now operating with Colonel Kurtz.

1316
01:50:32.687 --> 01:50:36.316
Saigon was carrying him
MIA for his family's sake.

1317
01:50:36.399 --> 01:50:38.860
They assumed he was dead.

1318
01:50:38.943 --> 01:50:42.030
Then they intercepted a letter
he tried to send to his wife."

1319
01:50:46.326 --> 01:50:48.369
Captain Richard Colby...

1320
01:50:50.288 --> 01:50:51.956
he was with Kurtz.

1321
01:50:53.374 --> 01:50:54.542
Disneyland.

1322
01:50:55.418 --> 01:50:58.296
Fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.

1323
01:50:58.379 --> 01:51:01.341
"Charles Miller Manson
ordered the slaughter

1324
01:51:01.424 --> 01:51:04.719
of all in the home
anyway as a symbol of protest.”

1325
01:51:04.803 --> 01:51:06.596
That's really weird, ain't it?

1326
01:51:07.472 --> 01:51:10.475
- Purple haze, look.
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1327
01:51:10.558 --> 01:51:14.187
- I got a tape from my mom.
- Chief, rainbow reality, man.

1328
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:16.648
Hey, Chief, get a good whiff.

1329
01:51:16.731 --> 01:51:19.567
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.

1330
01:51:20.401 --> 01:51:23.196
She pictures me at home
having a beer and watching TV.

1331
01:51:25.156 --> 01:51:27.075
Hey, Lance, man.

1332
01:51:27.158 --> 01:51:28.576
Hot potato! Hot potato!

1333
01:51:29.661 --> 01:51:31.454
I'm so glad you decided to join...

1334
01:51:31.538 --> 01:51:34.499
Eva's not sure if she can
have a relationship with me, you know?

1335
01:51:35.208 --> 01:51:37.919
Here I am, 13,000 fucking miles away,

1336
01:51:38.002 --> 01:51:41.214
trying to keep a relationship open,
my ass.

1337
01:51:41.297 --> 01:51:44.843
That's much more
than I can say for some of your friends.

1338
01:51:45.218 --> 01:51:48.721
If this tape is any good,
I will have Dad and the family

1339
01:51:48.805 --> 01:51:51.766
- send you a tape of their own...
- Hey, Lance.

1340
01:52:10.535 --> 01:52:11.661
There! Over there!

1341
01:52:14.247 --> 01:52:16.124
Motherfuckers!

1342
01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:28.720
There! Over there!

1343
01:52:32.223 --> 01:52:34.017
Lance! Chef!

1344
01:52:38.146 --> 01:52:42.859
- Chef, Chef, check out Clean!
- Captain, he's hit, he's hit! Clean's hit!

1345
01:52:43.318 --> 01:52:45.069
- Lance!
- Where'd the dog go?

1346
01:52:45.153 --> 01:52:47.989
Lance. Lance, check out Clean!

1347
01:52:48.448 --> 01:52:51.576
Where's the dog?
We got to go back to get the dog!

1348
01:52:51.659 --> 01:52:52.744
Hey, Clean.

1349
01:52:52.827 --> 01:52:55.121
It's always been nice to have...

1350
01:52:55.204 --> 01:52:57.582
Hey, Bubbal!

1351
01:52:57.665 --> 01:52:59.417
Bubba, you can't die, you fucker!

1352
01:53:01.778 --> 01:53:04.448
- And so, I'm hoping...
- Bubbal!

1353
01:53:04.531 --> 01:53:09.327
...that pretty soon, not too soon,
but pretty soon,

1354
01:53:09.411 --> 01:53:13.123
<i>I'll have a lot of grandchildren
to love and spoil,</i>

1355
01:53:13.415 --> 01:53:16.543
and then when your wife get them back,
she'll be mad with me.

1356
01:53:16.626 --> 01:53:18.045
Ha, ha, ha.

1357
01:53:18.795 --> 01:53:24.092
Even Aunt Jessie and Mama
will come to celebrate your coming home.

1358
01:53:24.593 --> 01:53:28.138
Granny and Dad are trying
to get enough money to get you a car.

1359
01:53:28.221 --> 01:53:31.767
But don't tell her,
because that's our secret.

1360
01:53:33.101 --> 01:53:37.939
Anyhow, do the right thing,
stay out of the way of the bullets,

1361
01:53:38.482 --> 01:53:42.444
and bring your heinie home
all in one piece

1362
01:53:42.527 --> 01:53:46.698
because we love you very much. Love, Mama.

1363
01:53:55.123 --> 01:53:59.503
Oh, man. You're so young.

1364
01:54:06.134 --> 01:54:07.803
Clean.

1365
01:55:21.001 --> 01:55:23.044
Hold on.

1366
01:55:25.046 --> 01:55:27.674
Throw me the glasses.

1367
01:55:39.144 --> 01:55:42.939
Lance, take the .16 on the bow.

1368
01:55:44.524 --> 01:55:47.944
Chef, Chef, on the .60.

1369
01:56:10.467 --> 01:56:12.552
Fuck me.

1370
01:56:49.464 --> 01:56:51.466
Lance.

1371
01:57:20.495 --> 01:57:22.330
Cover the Captain.

1372
01:57:22.414 --> 01:57:24.874
Lance, cover the Captain.

1373
01:57:42.309 --> 01:57:44.060
They're French. They're French.

1374
01:57:45.562 --> 01:57:48.773
Chef, pick up that weapon! Pick it up!
Pick it up!

1375
01:57:48.857 --> 01:57:50.817
Stand fast! Captain...

1376
01:58:26.102 --> 01:58:29.064
All right, you men, put down your weapons.

1377
01:59:17.278 --> 01:59:18.530
New Orleans.

1378
01:59:23.368 --> 01:59:26.037
We lost one of our men.

1379
01:59:28.915 --> 01:59:33.628
We French always pay
respects to the dead of our allies.

1380
01:59:35.630 --> 01:59:38.258
You are all welcome.

1381
01:59:40.176 --> 01:59:43.138
My name is Hubert de Marais.

1382
01:59:43.805 --> 01:59:46.891
This is my family's plantation.

1383
01:59:46.975 --> 01:59:49.978
It has been such for 70 years.

1384
01:59:51.146 --> 01:59:54.732
And it will be such until we are all dead.

1385
02:02:06.030 --> 02:02:11.744
Captain, accept the flag of Tyrone
Miller on behalf of a grateful nation.

1386
02:02:31.848 --> 02:02:36.394
This food is really wonderful, isn't it?
The wine, the sauces. I can't believe it.

1387
02:02:36.477 --> 02:02:38.563
Can I speak with the chef?

1388
02:02:38.646 --> 02:02:40.857
The chef speaks only Vietnamese.

1389
02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:44.902
No kidding. He cooks like this
and he can't even speak French?

1390
02:02:44.986 --> 02:02:48.489
Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.

1391
02:02:49.991 --> 02:02:51.743
Hey, Lance.

1392
02:03:20.271 --> 02:03:21.898
This is Baudelaire.

1393
02:03:21.981 --> 02:03:25.068
It's a very cruel poem for children,
but they need it,

1394
02:03:25.151 --> 02:03:28.655
because life sometimes is very cruel.

1395
02:03:29.656 --> 02:03:32.116
As you can see...

1396
02:03:34.619 --> 02:03:38.873
- Attacks repelled by the family.
- Just for this war.

1397
02:03:38.956 --> 02:03:41.626
Viet Cong, 58.

1398
02:03:41.709 --> 02:03:44.170
North Vietnamese, 12.

1399
02:03:44.253 --> 02:03:46.964
South Vietnamese, 11.

1400
02:03:47.048 --> 02:03:49.676
Americans, six.

1401
02:03:50.385 --> 02:03:54.055
Yes, well, they were perhaps mistakes.

1402
02:04:14.409 --> 02:04:17.829
May I present Captain Willard?
He's of a paratroop regiment.

1403
02:04:17.912 --> 02:04:20.915
- Madame Sarrault.
- Captain.

1404
02:04:47.775 --> 02:04:50.528
I'm sorry, Captain.
Was just a little story about Paris

1405
02:04:50.611 --> 02:04:52.029
and people starving during the war.

1406
02:04:52.113 --> 02:04:54.198
They are around the table
and there was a silence.

1407
02:04:54.282 --> 02:04:57.076
Somebody says, "An angel is passing by."

1408
02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:00.079
So somebody said, "Let's eat it."

1409
02:05:00.872 --> 02:05:02.498
Oh.

1410
02:05:07.962 --> 02:05:11.632
How long can you possibly stay here?

1411
02:05:11.716 --> 02:05:13.801
We stay forever.

1412
02:05:13.885 --> 02:05:16.596
No, no, I mean,

1413
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:19.599
when will you go back home to France?

1414
02:05:22.685 --> 02:05:24.896
I mean, this is our home, Captain.

1415
02:05:24.979 --> 02:05:26.647
- Sooner or later you're gonna...
- No!

1416
02:05:28.816 --> 02:05:33.321
You don't understand our mentality,
the French Officer mentality.

1417
02:05:33.446 --> 02:05:35.740
At first, we lose in Second World War.

1418
02:05:35.823 --> 02:05:38.910
I don't say that you Americans win,
but we lose.

1419
02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:43.998
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose.
In Nigeria, we lose.

1420
02:05:44.081 --> 02:05:46.459
In Indochina, we lose.

1421
02:05:46.542 --> 02:05:49.587
But here, we don't lose.

1422
02:05:49.670 --> 02:05:55.593
This piece of earth, we keep it!
We will never lose that, never!

1423
02:06:00.264 --> 02:06:02.016
The Americans,

1424
02:06:02.099 --> 02:06:04.811
In...

1425
02:06:04.894 --> 02:06:08.189
1945, yes,

1426
02:06:08.272 --> 02:06:11.108
after the Japanese War,

1427
02:06:11.192 --> 02:06:13.611
your President Roosevelt
didn't want the French people

1428
02:06:13.694 --> 02:06:16.614
to stay in Indochina.

1429
02:06:17.698 --> 02:06:22.286
So, you Americans invent the Viet Minh.

1430
02:06:24.539 --> 02:06:26.499
- What's he mean?
- Yeah, that's true.

1431
02:06:26.582 --> 02:06:29.877
The Viet Cong were
invented by the Americans, sir.

1432
02:06:30.378 --> 02:06:32.129
The Americans?

1433
02:06:32.213 --> 02:06:37.051
Now you take the French place,
and the Viet Minh fight you,

1434
02:06:37.134 --> 02:06:39.011
and what can you do?

1435
02:06:39.095 --> 02:06:41.639
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

1436
02:06:41.722 --> 02:06:45.142
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.

1437
02:06:45.226 --> 02:06:47.520
The Russians want to help them.

1438
02:06:47.603 --> 02:06:50.481
"Come and give us some money.
We are all communists.

1439
02:06:50.565 --> 02:06:52.859
Chinese, give us guns.
We are all brothers."

1440
02:06:52.942 --> 02:06:55.194
They hate the Chinese.

1441
02:06:55.278 --> 02:06:59.740
Maybe they hate Americans less
than the Russians and the Chinese.

1442
02:06:59.824 --> 02:07:01.534
I mean, if tomorrow the
Vietnamese are communists,

1443
02:07:01.617 --> 02:07:04.412
they will be Vietnamese communists.

1444
02:07:04.495 --> 02:07:07.832
And this is something that you
never understood, you Americans.

1445
02:07:07.915 --> 02:07:12.920
I don't know. Maybe in the future we
can make something with the Viet Minh.

1446
02:07:13.004 --> 02:07:14.839
Don't you understand?

1447
02:07:14.922 --> 02:07:17.675
The VC say, "Go away! Go away'!"

1448
02:07:17.758 --> 02:07:20.469
That's finished for all the
white people in Indochina.

1449
02:07:20.553 --> 02:07:23.848
If you're French, American,
that's all the same.

1450
02:07:23.931 --> 02:07:26.559
Go! They want to forget you.

1451
02:07:26.642 --> 02:07:27.685
Look at them.

1452
02:07:29.729 --> 02:07:32.607
Look, this is the truth. An egg.

1453
02:07:35.651 --> 02:07:37.904
The white left.

1454
02:07:38.696 --> 02:07:41.407
The yellow stay.

1455
02:07:48.623 --> 02:07:52.251
When I was in Saigon,
I spoke to an American politician

1456
02:07:52.335 --> 02:07:57.340
and he explained it very well.
He said, "Look, yesterday it was Korea,

1457
02:07:57.423 --> 02:08:03.596
today, Vietnam, tomorrow, Thailand,
the Philippines, and then maybe Europe.”

1458
02:08:05.806 --> 02:08:07.099
Why not Europe?

1459
02:08:07.183 --> 02:08:09.644
Look what happened in
Czechoslovakia recently!

1460
02:08:09.727 --> 02:08:11.354
And even before the Second World War,

1461
02:08:11.437 --> 02:08:13.522
the Americans knew
exactly what was going on.

1462
02:08:13.606 --> 02:08:16.484
They don't want that shit to take over!

1463
02:08:18.945 --> 02:08:23.449
- All you white people are shit.
- They are fighting. Fighting for freedom.

1464
02:08:23.532 --> 02:08:25.952
Freedom? Bullshit.

1465
02:08:26.035 --> 02:08:29.121
French bullshit. American bullshit.

1466
02:08:29.205 --> 02:08:35.169
Dien Bien Phu is a trap.
All soldiers know they are already dead.

1467
02:08:36.879 --> 02:08:39.632
You know anything about Dien Bien Phu?

1468
02:08:41.926 --> 02:08:44.762
- Yeah, I know.
- No, you don't,

1469
02:08:44.845 --> 02:08:45.888
not really.

1470
02:08:45.972 --> 02:08:49.016
Dien Bien Phu was an error, you know?
A military mistake.

1471
02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:52.937
A mistake? A voluntary mistake! Voluntary!

1472
02:08:55.481 --> 02:09:00.111
All the soldiers knew.
We knew we would be dead.

1473
02:09:00.194 --> 02:09:01.946
Generals and
colonels believe it's impossible

1474
02:09:02.029 --> 02:09:06.993
for the Viets to get a cannon up
there in the mountains, but they do.

1475
02:09:07.076 --> 02:09:10.705
Then they wait for the rain to come.

1476
02:09:11.038 --> 02:09:15.209
When it comes, no airplane can fly there.

1477
02:09:15.292 --> 02:09:20.923
And our paratroopers jump at 90 meters.
I mean, you know, 90 meters, 70 meters...

1478
02:09:21.007 --> 02:09:24.677
I mean, that's crazy.
No army in the world can do that.

1479
02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.639
And they only do that to
be dead with their friends.

1480
02:09:30.224 --> 02:09:31.600
No, no!

1481
02:09:34.729 --> 02:09:37.023
The French army was sacrificed,

1482
02:09:37.106 --> 02:09:39.817
sacrificed by the
politicians safe at home.

1483
02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:42.486
They put the army in an impossible
situation where they couldn't win.

1484
02:09:43.821 --> 02:09:47.324
The students are marching in Paris,
protesting, demonstrating.

1485
02:09:47.408 --> 02:09:49.577
They stab the soldiers in the back.

1486
02:09:49.660 --> 02:09:53.748
The soldier would open the grenade,
it wouldn't work.

1487
02:09:53.831 --> 02:09:56.000
A piece of paper would fall.

1488
02:09:58.002 --> 02:09:59.628
Union of French Women.

1489
02:09:59.712 --> 02:10:01.464
"We are for the Viets."

1490
02:10:01.547 --> 02:10:03.174
Traitors.

1491
02:10:03.257 --> 02:10:06.218
Communist traitors at home.

1492
02:10:06.802 --> 02:10:12.099
Dien Bien Phu... Okay, the French is shit.

1493
02:10:13.392 --> 02:10:15.644
No one cares. No one wants to.

1494
02:10:18.314 --> 02:10:22.151
Why don't you Americans learn from us?
From our mistakes?

1495
02:10:22.610 --> 02:10:24.612
Mon dieu, with your army, your strength,
your power,

1496
02:10:24.695 --> 02:10:26.238
you can win if you want to.

1497
02:10:28.949 --> 02:10:31.035
You can win.

1498
02:10:33.579 --> 02:10:37.458
You know,
I'm sure we can make something there.

1499
02:10:37.541 --> 02:10:39.585
I'm sure about it, you know?

1500
02:10:39.668 --> 02:10:42.713
I never do something
wrong to the people here.

1501
02:10:42.797 --> 02:10:45.591
I'm sorry, you know, but the communists
at home have never been traitors.

1502
02:11:20.167 --> 02:11:23.754
Excuse me. I have to go.
Captain, good night.

1503
02:11:23.838 --> 02:11:26.423
- I was a socialist, you know?
- I know we can stay.

1504
02:11:26.507 --> 02:11:29.760
I know that we can stay. We can stay.

1505
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:36.809
You know, we always help the people.

1506
02:11:36.892 --> 02:11:38.602
We work with the people.

1507
02:11:55.161 --> 02:11:59.415
See, Captain, when my grandfather...

1508
02:12:00.749 --> 02:12:04.044
and my uncles and father came here...

1509
02:12:05.588 --> 02:12:09.008
there was nothing. Nothing.

1510
02:12:09.550 --> 02:12:12.553
The Vietnamese were nothing.

1511
02:12:13.637 --> 02:12:17.474
So, we worked hard, very hard.

1512
02:12:17.558 --> 02:12:23.189
We brought the rubber from
Brazil and then planted it here.

1513
02:12:23.272 --> 02:12:26.901
We took the Vietnamese, work with them,

1514
02:12:26.984 --> 02:12:28.986
make something.

1515
02:12:29.069 --> 02:12:31.906
Something out of nothing.

1516
02:12:32.656 --> 02:12:37.161
So when you ask me why we
want to stay here, Captain,

1517
02:12:37.912 --> 02:12:42.499
we want to stay here because it's ours.
It belongs to us.

1518
02:12:42.583 --> 02:12:45.085
It keeps our family together.

1519
02:12:45.794 --> 02:12:48.839
I mean, we fight for that.

1520
02:12:49.924 --> 02:12:52.551
While you Americans,

1521
02:12:52.635 --> 02:12:58.349
you are fighting for
the biggest nothing in history.

1522
02:13:05.481 --> 02:13:07.650
I'm sorry, Captain.

1523
02:13:07.733 --> 02:13:12.655
I will see if your men need
any help to repair your boat

1524
02:13:12.738 --> 02:13:16.533
so that you can go on with your war.

1525
02:13:51.277 --> 02:13:54.780
I apologize for my family, Captain.

1526
02:13:55.990 --> 02:13:58.951
We have all lost much here.

1527
02:13:59.493 --> 02:14:03.455
Hubert, his wife and two sons.

1528
02:14:07.167 --> 02:14:10.170
And I have lost a husband.

1529
02:14:15.259 --> 02:14:19.888
- I understand.
- You are tired of the war.

1530
02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:23.600
I can see on your face.

1531
02:14:25.894 --> 02:14:29.690
It was the same in the eyes
of the soldiers of our war.

1532
02:14:31.233 --> 02:14:34.570
We call them...

1533
02:14:35.404 --> 02:14:38.032
"The lost soldiers.”

1534
02:14:42.077 --> 02:14:45.456
If you like, we can have some cognac.

1535
02:14:49.376 --> 02:14:51.337
No.

1536
02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:55.215
I'll see about my men and...

1537
02:15:02.181 --> 02:15:05.601
The war will be still here tomorrow.

1538
02:15:15.527 --> 02:15:18.405
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1539
02:15:25.579 --> 02:15:29.083
I noticed you had no wine at dinner.

1540
02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:32.336
No, I don't drink wine.

1541
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:40.928
I do like cognac,
but I don't want any now, thank you.

1542
02:15:41.011 --> 02:15:43.055
Well,

1543
02:15:43.722 --> 02:15:47.309
then I must drink alone.

1544
02:15:56.777 --> 02:16:00.989
Will you go back, after the war,
to America?

1545
02:16:04.451 --> 02:16:05.702
No.

1546
02:16:05.786 --> 02:16:09.873
Then you're like us. Your home is here.

1547
02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:31.395
Do you know why you can never
step into the same river twice?

1548
02:16:32.813 --> 02:16:34.606
Yeah,

1549
02:16:34.690 --> 02:16:36.942
'cause it's always moving.

1550
02:16:37.401 --> 02:16:41.363
I used to prepare a pipe for my husband.

1551
02:16:47.828 --> 02:16:52.958
It was the morphine he took for
the wounds he suffered in his heart.

1552
02:16:55.794 --> 02:17:00.257
He would rage and he would cry,
my lost soldier.

1553
02:17:03.177 --> 02:17:05.512
And I said to him,

1554
02:17:05.596 --> 02:17:09.808
"There are two of you, don't you see?

1555
02:17:10.058 --> 02:17:14.521
One that kills and one that loves."

1556
02:17:15.814 --> 02:17:18.275
And he said to me,

1557
02:17:18.358 --> 02:17:22.613
"I don't know whether
I am an animal or a god."

1558
02:17:25.449 --> 02:17:27.910
But you are both.

1559
02:18:08.951 --> 02:18:11.537
You want more?

1560
02:18:16.416 --> 02:18:20.045
All that matters is that you are alive.

1561
02:18:21.922 --> 02:18:24.508
You are alive, Captain.

1562
02:18:28.136 --> 02:18:30.597
That's the truth.

1563
02:19:43.670 --> 02:19:48.008
There are two of you, don't you see?

1564
02:19:48.508 --> 02:19:50.844
One that kills

1565
02:19:51.303 --> 02:19:53.555
and one that loves.

1566
02:20:22.042 --> 02:20:24.586
Can't see nothing. We're stopping.

1567
02:20:25.087 --> 02:20:27.464
You're not
authorized to stop this boat, Chief.

1568
02:20:27.547 --> 02:20:31.051
I said I can't see a thing,
Captain. I'm stopping this boat.

1569
02:20:31.134 --> 02:20:32.719
I ain't risking no more lives.

1570
02:20:32.803 --> 02:20:35.722
I'm in command here,
Goddamn it. You'll do what I say.

1571
02:20:37.599 --> 02:20:39.559
You see anything, Chef?

1572
02:20:42.062 --> 02:20:44.606
Why don't they fucking attack, man?

1573
02:21:03.625 --> 02:21:05.752
Watch it over here, Chief.

1574
02:21:06.878 --> 02:21:08.171
Got a stump.

1575
02:21:10.549 --> 02:21:12.050
Lance, on the .50s.

1576
02:21:13.135 --> 02:21:14.928
He was close.

1577
02:21:16.972 --> 02:21:18.640
He was real close.

1578
02:21:20.934 --> 02:21:23.228
I couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him,

1579
02:21:23.854 --> 02:21:25.814
as if the boat were being sucked upriver

1580
02:21:25.897 --> 02:21:28.442
and the water was
flowing back into the jungle.

1581
02:21:31.319 --> 02:21:33.739
Whatever was going to happen,

1582
02:21:33.822 --> 02:21:37.784
it wasn't gonna be the way
they called it back in Nha Trang.

1583
02:21:41.981 --> 02:21:43.441
Arrows!

1584
02:21:43.524 --> 02:21:44.650
Fire!

1585
02:21:46.694 --> 02:21:48.821
Chef, open up! Fire!

1586
02:21:53.159 --> 02:21:55.161
Lance, fire!

1587
02:22:02.794 --> 02:22:08.341
Chef! Chef, it's okay. Quit firing.
They're just little toy arrows.

1588
02:22:08.633 --> 02:22:10.718
Cut it out! Quiet!

1589
02:22:11.177 --> 02:22:13.763
Chief, tell them to hold their fire!

1590
02:22:13.846 --> 02:22:16.265
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1591
02:22:16.349 --> 02:22:17.934
Quiet!

1592
02:22:18.976 --> 02:22:21.771
You got us in this mess,
and now you can't get us out

1593
02:22:21.854 --> 02:22:23.773
because you don't know where
the hell you're going, do you?

1594
02:22:24.357 --> 02:22:25.525
Do you?

1595
02:22:26.526 --> 02:22:29.404
You son of a bitch! You bastard!

1596
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:33.366
- Lance, get the wheel!
- Fire!

1597
02:22:34.033 --> 02:22:37.578
You savages!
Come and get it, you son of a bitches!

1598
02:22:58.057 --> 02:23:00.101
A spear.

1599
02:24:19.180 --> 02:24:22.016
My mission
is to make it up into Cambodia.

1600
02:24:22.642 --> 02:24:25.102
There's a Green Beret
colonel up there who's gone insane

1601
02:24:25.186 --> 02:24:27.188
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1602
02:24:28.481 --> 02:24:31.442
That's fucking typical! Shit!

1603
02:24:31.526 --> 02:24:33.736
Fucking Vietnam mission!

1604
02:24:33.819 --> 02:24:37.573
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1605
02:24:37.657 --> 02:24:41.577
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.

1606
02:24:42.245 --> 02:24:45.623
Shit! That's fucking crazy.

1607
02:24:45.706 --> 02:24:48.709
I mean, I thought you were
going in to blow up a bridge

1608
02:24:48.793 --> 02:24:51.671
or some fucking
railroad tracks or something.

1609
02:24:52.421 --> 02:24:54.715
- Sorry.
- No, no, wait, wait.

1610
02:24:54.799 --> 02:24:58.094
We'll go together on the boat.
We'll go with you.

1611
02:24:58.177 --> 02:25:01.847
We'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay?

1612
02:26:08.914 --> 02:26:10.791
Part of me was
afraid of what I would find

1613
02:26:10.875 --> 02:26:12.877
and what I would do when I got there.

1614
02:26:15.921 --> 02:26:17.298
I knew the risks...

1615
02:26:18.799 --> 02:26:20.301
or imagined I knew.

1616
02:26:22.928 --> 02:26:27.099
But the thing I felt the most,
much stronger than fear...

1617
02:26:28.726 --> 02:26:30.645
was the desire to confront him.

1618
02:27:43.342 --> 02:27:44.635
Just keep moving.

1619
02:27:45.344 --> 02:27:49.014
Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.

1620
02:29:15.935 --> 02:29:19.104
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

1621
02:29:20.272 --> 02:29:23.526
I ain't coming in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1622
02:29:24.944 --> 02:29:28.197
Zap them with your siren, man.
Zap them with your siren.

1623
02:29:38.624 --> 02:29:40.543
There's mines over there
and mines over there, too.

1624
02:29:40.626 --> 02:29:43.087
And watch out. Those goddamn
monkeys bite you, I'll tell you.

1625
02:29:43.963 --> 02:29:46.465
That's a pretty one.
Move it right in toward me.

1626
02:29:47.883 --> 02:29:51.762
I'm an American! Yeah!
An American civilian. Hi, Yanks.

1627
02:29:52.471 --> 02:29:53.973
Hi, American.

1628
02:29:54.473 --> 02:29:55.891
American civilian. It's all right.

1629
02:29:56.642 --> 02:29:59.562
And you got the cigarettes.
And that's what I've been dreaming about.

1630
02:30:00.729 --> 02:30:01.814
Chef.

1631
02:30:02.565 --> 02:30:05.234
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1632
02:30:09.530 --> 02:30:11.156
I'm a photojournalist.

1633
02:30:11.824 --> 02:30:16.745
I've covered the war since 64.
I've been in Laos, Cambodia and Nam.

1634
02:30:21.417 --> 02:30:24.169
I'll tell you one thing,
this boat is a mess, man.

1635
02:30:25.170 --> 02:30:26.505
Who are all these people?

1636
02:30:26.589 --> 02:30:29.133
Yeah, they think you've come to...

1637
02:30:30.676 --> 02:30:31.927
take him away,

1638
02:30:32.011 --> 02:30:34.889
- and I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?

1639
02:30:37.182 --> 02:30:38.267
Him!

1640
02:30:38.893 --> 02:30:40.102
Colonel Kurtz.

1641
02:30:40.978 --> 02:30:43.689
These are all his children, man,
as far as you can see.

1642
02:30:44.982 --> 02:30:47.484
Hell, man, out here,
we're all his children.

1643
02:30:48.402 --> 02:30:49.612
Could we...

1644
02:30:50.613 --> 02:30:51.780
talk to Colonel Kurtz?

1645
02:30:52.364 --> 02:30:55.117
Hey, man, you don't talk to the Colonel.

1646
02:30:56.535 --> 02:30:58.454
Well, you listen to him.

1647
02:30:59.538 --> 02:31:05.252
The man's enlarged my mind.
He's a poet warrior in the classic sense.

1648
02:31:05.878 --> 02:31:09.089
Sometimes you'll say hello to him, right,

1649
02:31:09.173 --> 02:31:11.550
and he'll just walk right by
you and he won't even notice you.

1650
02:31:11.634 --> 02:31:15.137
And then suddenly he'll grab you,
he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say,

1651
02:31:15.220 --> 02:31:18.307
"Do you know that 'if is the middle
word in 'life"? If you can keep your head

1652
02:31:18.390 --> 02:31:20.184
"when all about you are losing
theirs and blaming it on you,

1653
02:31:20.267 --> 02:31:21.685
if you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you..."

1654
02:31:23.020 --> 02:31:26.231
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.

1655
02:31:27.024 --> 02:31:29.485
"I should have been
a pair of ragged claws,

1656
02:31:29.568 --> 02:31:32.446
Scuttling across
the floors of silent seas."

1657
02:31:32.529 --> 02:31:34.073
Stay with the boat.

1658
02:31:35.324 --> 02:31:38.202
Don't go without me, okay?
I wanna get a picture.

1659
02:31:40.746 --> 02:31:45.417
He can be terrible, he can be mean,
and he can be right.

1660
02:31:46.418 --> 02:31:49.254
He's fighting the war. He's a great man.

1661
02:31:51.382 --> 02:31:53.425
I mean...

1662
02:31:57.346 --> 02:32:00.891
I wish I had words, you know?
I wish I had words.

1663
02:32:00.975 --> 02:32:03.519
I can tell you something, like,
the other day he wanted to kill me.

1664
02:32:04.144 --> 02:32:06.355
- Something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?

1665
02:32:06.855 --> 02:32:08.440
Because I took his picture.

1666
02:32:09.441 --> 02:32:11.735
He said, "If you take my picture again...

1667
02:32:13.112 --> 02:32:14.446
I'm gonna kill you..."

1668
02:32:15.656 --> 02:32:16.991
And he meant it.

1669
02:32:19.493 --> 02:32:23.455
So you just lay cool.
Play it cool, laid back. Dig it.

1670
02:32:24.081 --> 02:32:25.791
He gets friendly again. He really does.

1671
02:32:27.418 --> 02:32:29.795
But you don't judge the Colonel.

1672
02:32:30.713 --> 02:32:32.840
You don't judge the
Colonel like an ordinary man.

1673
02:32:39.722 --> 02:32:43.183
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans. Americans!

1674
02:32:43.267 --> 02:32:44.768
You can feel the vibe of this place.

1675
02:32:45.769 --> 02:32:49.231
Let me take your picture.
Could you hold... Hello? Hello?

1676
02:32:49.314 --> 02:32:50.816
Could you hold up a minute?

1677
02:33:13.172 --> 02:33:14.339
Colby.

1678
02:33:30.397 --> 02:33:34.276
The heads. You're looking at the heads.

1679
02:33:36.236 --> 02:33:38.530
Sometimes he goes too far.

1680
02:33:38.614 --> 02:33:40.449
He's the first one to admit it.

1681
02:33:41.575 --> 02:33:43.827
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!

1682
02:33:45.788 --> 02:33:48.749
If you could have heard
the man just two days ago.

1683
02:33:48.832 --> 02:33:51.418
If you could have heard him then, God...

1684
02:33:51.502 --> 02:33:53.378
You're gonna call him crazy?

1685
02:33:53.962 --> 02:33:55.339
Fucking A.

1686
02:33:56.799 --> 02:33:58.217
I just wanna talk to him.

1687
02:34:00.594 --> 02:34:02.137
Well, man, he's gone away.

1688
02:34:04.056 --> 02:34:06.475
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1689
02:34:06.558 --> 02:34:09.311
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.

1690
02:34:10.229 --> 02:34:12.272
He forgets himself with his people.

1691
02:34:14.233 --> 02:34:17.069
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?

1692
02:34:17.152 --> 02:34:18.821
Maybe we should wait back at the boat.

1693
02:34:20.114 --> 02:34:21.490
Okay, Chef.

1694
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:26.411
- We'll go back to the boat for a while.
- Yeah, stay with Lance.

1695
02:34:49.685 --> 02:34:54.523
This Colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
He's worse than crazy. He's evil!

1696
02:34:55.858 --> 02:34:57.484
That's what the man's got set up here!

1697
02:34:57.568 --> 02:34:59.903
Man, it's fucking Pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

1698
02:35:01.405 --> 02:35:04.116
- Shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?

1699
02:35:04.825 --> 02:35:07.953
Help you? Fucking A, I'll help you.
I'll do anything to get out of this joint.

1700
02:35:08.036 --> 02:35:09.663
Good boy.

1701
02:35:09.746 --> 02:35:11.206
We could blow
all them assholes away.

1702
02:35:11.290 --> 02:35:13.917
They're so fucking spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1703
02:35:14.835 --> 02:35:19.339
I ain't afraid of all them
fucking skulls and altars and shit.

1704
02:35:21.466 --> 02:35:25.095
I used to think
if I died in an evil place,

1705
02:35:25.679 --> 02:35:27.764
then my soul wouldn't be
able to make it to heaven.

1706
02:35:28.724 --> 02:35:31.685
But now, fuck.

1707
02:35:33.896 --> 02:35:36.190
I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1708
02:35:36.773 --> 02:35:39.610
So what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.

1709
02:35:39.693 --> 02:35:41.486
- No, no.
- Get out of here.

1710
02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:43.197
I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1711
02:35:43.947 --> 02:35:47.492
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around,
check the place out,

1712
02:35:48.118 --> 02:35:50.287
see if I can find the Colonel, okay?

1713
02:35:51.788 --> 02:35:55.167
- What do you want me to do?
- Damn it.

1714
02:35:55.250 --> 02:36:01.256
Here, you take the radio,
and if I don't get back by 2200 hours...

1715
02:36:04.134 --> 02:36:05.469
you call in the air strike.

1716
02:36:08.263 --> 02:36:09.640
Air strike?

1717
02:36:11.391 --> 02:36:16.063
The code is "Almighty,"
coordinates 0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1718
02:36:16.980 --> 02:36:18.315
It's all in there.

1719
02:36:19.983 --> 02:36:22.778
0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1720
02:36:31.495 --> 02:36:34.831
Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane.

1721
02:36:39.211 --> 02:36:44.967
The place was full of bodies.
North Vietnamese, Viet Cong, Cambodians.

1722
02:36:52.557 --> 02:36:55.560
If I was still alive,
it was because he wanted me that way.

1723
02:37:05.904 --> 02:37:06.905
Hey!

1724
02:37:30.012 --> 02:37:32.431
It smelled like slow death in there.

1725
02:37:34.016 --> 02:37:37.269
Malaria, nightmares.

1726
02:37:40.063 --> 02:37:42.357
This was the end of the river, all right.

1727
02:37:56.413 --> 02:37:57.831
Where are you from, Willard?

1728
02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:05.005
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1729
02:38:10.969 --> 02:38:14.014
- Were you born there?
- Yes, sir.

1730
02:38:15.766 --> 02:38:18.894
- Whereabouts?
- Toledo, sir.

1731
02:38:25.776 --> 02:38:27.569
How far are you from the river?

1732
02:38:34.534 --> 02:38:36.244
The Ohio River, sir?

1733
02:38:37.496 --> 02:38:40.457
- Uh-huh.
- About 200 miles.

1734
02:38:48.465 --> 02:38:51.426
I went down that river
once when I was a kid.

1735
02:38:56.306 --> 02:38:59.309
There's a place in the river,
I can't remember.

1736
02:38:59.393 --> 02:39:04.564
It must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1737
02:39:04.648 --> 02:39:07.401
It's all wild and overgrown now,

1738
02:39:07.484 --> 02:39:13.990
but for about five miles, you'd think
that heaven just fell on the Earth...

1739
02:39:15.409 --> 02:39:17.369
in the form of gardenias.

1740
02:39:33.677 --> 02:39:38.723
Have you ever
considered any real freedoms?

1741
02:39:44.521 --> 02:39:47.441
Freedoms from the opinion of others?

1742
02:39:50.986 --> 02:39:52.946
Even the opinions of yourself?

1743
02:40:09.129 --> 02:40:12.716
Did they say why, Willard?

1744
02:40:14.968 --> 02:40:19.681
Why they wanted to terminate my command?

1745
02:40:35.322 --> 02:40:37.532
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.

1746
02:40:41.745 --> 02:40:43.413
No longer classified...

1747
02:40:44.664 --> 02:40:45.916
is it?

1748
02:40:52.589 --> 02:40:54.007
What did they tell you?

1749
02:40:57.010 --> 02:40:58.553
They told me

1750
02:40:59.262 --> 02:41:00.805
that you had gone...

1751
02:41:02.098 --> 02:41:03.391
totally insane...

1752
02:41:06.269 --> 02:41:10.732
and that your methods were

1753
02:41:11.691 --> 02:41:12.901
unsound.

1754
02:41:16.446 --> 02:41:18.365
Are my methods unsound?

1755
02:41:24.454 --> 02:41:30.627
I don't see any method at all, sir.

1756
02:41:37.717 --> 02:41:41.346
I expected someone like you.

1757
02:41:44.724 --> 02:41:45.976
What did you expect?

1758
02:41:54.234 --> 02:41:55.819
Are you an assassin?

1759
02:42:00.699 --> 02:42:01.866
I'm a soldier.

1760
02:42:05.745 --> 02:42:07.330
You're neither.

1761
02:42:09.499 --> 02:42:11.001
You're an errand boy...

1762
02:42:12.669 --> 02:42:14.504
sent by grocery clerks...

1763
02:42:18.842 --> 02:42:20.510
to collect a bill.

1764
02:43:04.521 --> 02:43:10.151
Why, huh? Why would a nice guy
like you wanna kill a genius?

1765
02:43:16.991 --> 02:43:18.743
Going down pretty good, huh?

1766
02:43:19.494 --> 02:43:20.578
Why?

1767
02:43:22.288 --> 02:43:23.957
You know?

1768
02:43:24.749 --> 02:43:26.793
Do you know that the man...

1769
02:43:30.296 --> 02:43:32.298
the man really likes you?

1770
02:43:35.593 --> 02:43:37.804
He likes you. He really likes you...

1771
02:43:40.014 --> 02:43:41.891
but he's got something in mind for you.

1772
02:43:41.975 --> 02:43:44.727
Aren't you curious about that?

1773
02:43:45.311 --> 02:43:48.731
I'm curious. I'm very curious.

1774
02:43:50.066 --> 02:43:51.192
Are you curious?

1775
02:43:54.279 --> 02:43:57.073
There's something happening out here, man.

1776
02:44:00.493 --> 02:44:03.413
You know something, man?
I know something that you don't know.

1777
02:44:03.496 --> 02:44:05.123
That's right, jack.

1778
02:44:05.206 --> 02:44:07.500
The man is clear in his mind...

1779
02:44:08.918 --> 02:44:10.336
but his soul is mad.

1780
02:44:12.547 --> 02:44:13.840
Oh, yeah.

1781
02:44:14.966 --> 02:44:18.970
He's dying, I think.
He hates all this. He hates it.

1782
02:44:20.054 --> 02:44:23.933
But the man's...

1783
02:44:27.437 --> 02:44:29.939
He reads poetry out loud, all right?

1784
02:44:31.858 --> 02:44:33.026
And a voice...

1785
02:44:34.903 --> 02:44:36.154
a voice...

1786
02:44:38.865 --> 02:44:40.658
He likes you 'cause you're still alive.

1787
02:44:41.826 --> 02:44:43.536
He's got plans for you.

1788
02:44:43.620 --> 02:44:48.249
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.
You're gonna help him, man.

1789
02:44:49.208 --> 02:44:50.960
You're gonna help him.

1790
02:44:51.044 --> 02:44:53.504
What are they gonna say, man,
when he's gone? Huh?

1791
02:44:53.588 --> 02:44:58.259
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1792
02:44:58.343 --> 02:45:00.428
What are they gonna say about him?
What are they gonna say?

1793
02:45:00.511 --> 02:45:04.098
"He was a kind man. He was a wise man.

1794
02:45:04.182 --> 02:45:07.977
He had plans. He had wisdom."
Bullshit, man!

1795
02:45:08.061 --> 02:45:12.398
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1796
02:45:15.902 --> 02:45:16.986
You.

1797
02:45:22.325 --> 02:45:24.243
Almost eight hours.

1798
02:45:26.788 --> 02:45:30.249
God. I'm asleep.

1799
02:45:32.168 --> 02:45:34.921
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.

1800
02:45:47.016 --> 02:45:48.142
Fuck.

1801
02:45:52.438 --> 02:45:54.023
Has it been eight hours?

1802
02:45:57.110 --> 02:46:01.781
Hello, Almighty, Almighty,
this is PBR Street Gang.

1803
02:46:02.281 --> 02:46:03.282
Radio check. Over.

1804
02:46:04.450 --> 02:46:07.120
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty standing by. Over.

1805
02:47:30.726 --> 02:47:33.187
What the hell! Jesus!

1806
02:47:40.194 --> 02:47:41.946
Oh, Christ!

"The war on the horizon.

1810
02:50:01.877 --> 02:50:03.962
The American people may
find it hard to believe

1811
02:50:04.046 --> 02:50:07.591
that the US is
winning the war in Vietnam.

1812
02:50:07.674 --> 02:50:11.929
Nevertheless,
one of the most exhaustive inquiries

1813
02:50:12.012 --> 02:50:14.890
into the status of
the conflict yet compiled

1814
02:50:14.973 --> 02:50:18.185
offers considerable evidence
that the weight of US power,

1815
02:50:18.268 --> 02:50:20.979
two and a half years
after the big buildup began,

1816
02:50:21.063 --> 02:50:23.857
is beginning to make itself felt.

1817
02:50:23.941 --> 02:50:28.779
White House officials
maintain the impact of that strength

1818
02:50:29.113 --> 02:50:31.490
may bring the enemy to the point

1819
02:50:31.573 --> 02:50:36.120
where he could simply be
unable to continue fighting."

1820

Is this familiar?

1821
02:50:40.833 --> 02:50:44.044
"Because Lyndon Johnson
fears that the US public

1822
02:50:44.128 --> 02:50:47.923
is in no mood to accept
its optimistic conclusions,

1823
02:50:48.006 --> 02:50:50.676
he may never permit the
report to be released in full.

1824
02:50:50.759 --> 02:50:54.388
Even so, he is sufficiently
impressed with the findings

1825
02:50:54.471 --> 02:50:57.641
and sufficiently anxious to
make their conclusions known

1826
02:50:57.724 --> 02:51:00.727
to permit experts who
have been working on it

1827
02:51:00.811 --> 02:51:03.730
to talk about it in general terms."”

02:51:23.834 --> 02:51:27.045
who led the victory over
communist guerrillas in Malaya,

1831
02:51:27.129 --> 02:51:31.592
is now a Rand Corporation consultant,
recently returned to Vietnam

1832
02:51:31.675 --> 02:51:35.179
to sound out the situation
for President Nixon.

1833
02:51:35.262 --> 02:51:37.556
He told the President last week

1834
02:51:37.639 --> 02:51:44.062
that things felt much better
and smelled much better over there."

1835
02:51:45.147 --> 02:51:47.691
How do they smell to you, soldier?

1836
02:51:59.536 --> 02:52:02.497
You'll be free. You'll be under guard.

1837
02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:05.083
Read these at your leisure.

1838
02:52:05.167 --> 02:52:07.252
Don't lose them.

1839
02:52:07.336 --> 02:52:09.504
Don't try to escape. You'll be shot.

1840
02:52:11.423 --> 02:52:14.218
We can talk of these things later.

1841
02:55:32.780 --> 02:55:36.951
"We are the hollow men,
We are the stuffed men,

1842
02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:43.082
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!

1843
02:55:44.625 --> 02:55:47.169
Our dried voices,
when we whisper together,

1844
02:55:47.253 --> 02:55:50.589
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass...

1845
02:55:51.632 --> 02:55:54.176
- Or rats' feet over broken glass..."
- Oh, he's out there.

1846
02:55:54.260 --> 02:55:55.761
“In our dry cellar..."

1847
02:55:56.178 --> 02:55:57.388
He's really out there.

1848
02:55:57.471 --> 02:56:02.309
"Shape without form,
shade without color...

1849
02:56:03.644 --> 02:56:08.357
Paralyzed force,
gesture without motion..."

1850
02:56:08.441 --> 02:56:09.984
Do you know what the man's saying?

1851
02:56:11.318 --> 02:56:13.028
- Do you?
- "Those who have crossed..."

1852
02:56:13.654 --> 02:56:17.908
This is dialectics. It's very
simple dialectics. One through nine,

1853
02:56:17.992 --> 02:56:21.370
no "maybes," no "supposes," no fractions.
You can't travel in space.

1854
02:56:21.454 --> 02:56:25.833
You can't go out into space, you know,
without like... With fractions.

1855
02:56:25.916 --> 02:56:27.752
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?

1856
02:56:27.835 --> 02:56:30.588
What are you gonna do when you go
from here to Venus or something?

1857
02:56:30.671 --> 02:56:32.590
That's dialectic physics, okay?

1858
02:56:32.673 --> 02:56:34.759
Dialectic logic is,
"There's only love and hate."

1859
02:56:34.842 --> 02:56:36.886
You either love somebody or you hate them.

1860
02:56:37.344 --> 02:56:38.429
Mutt!

1861
02:56:40.765 --> 02:56:42.016
You mutt.

1862
02:56:42.850 --> 02:56:47.855
This is the way the fucking world ends.
Look at this fucking shit we're in, man!

1863
02:56:48.606 --> 02:56:50.608
"Not with a bang, a whimper."

1864
02:56:50.691 --> 02:56:53.027
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, jack.

1865
02:57:22.473 --> 02:57:25.601
On the river, I thought
that the minute I looked at him,

1866
02:57:25.684 --> 02:57:27.436
I'd know what to do.

1867
02:57:28.395 --> 02:57:29.647
But it didn't happen.

1868
02:57:31.607 --> 02:57:35.110
I was in there with him for days,
not under guard.

1869
02:57:35.861 --> 02:57:37.279
I was free.

1870
02:57:38.197 --> 02:57:40.449
But he knew [ wasn't going anywhere.

1871
02:57:41.700 --> 02:57:44.870
He knew more about
what I was going to do than I did.

1872
02:57:52.086 --> 02:57:55.589
If the generals back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw,

1873
02:57:56.549 --> 02:57:59.134
would they still want me to kill him?

1874
02:58:00.386 --> 02:58:02.263
More than ever, probably.

1875
02:58:03.722 --> 02:58:05.641
And what would his people back home want,

1876
02:58:05.724 --> 02:58:08.769
if they ever learned just how
far from them he'd really gone?

1877
02:58:11.355 --> 02:58:14.775
He broke from them,
and then he broke from himself.

1878
02:58:16.443 --> 02:58:20.614
I'd never seen a man
So broken up and ripped apart.

1879
02:58:21.615 --> 02:58:25.744
I've seen the horrors,
horrors that you've seen.

1880
02:58:28.414 --> 02:58:30.457
But you have no right
to call me a murderer.

1881
02:58:30.541 --> 02:58:32.334
You have a right to kill me.

1882
02:58:33.669 --> 02:58:36.005
You have a right to do that.

1883
02:58:37.798 --> 02:58:39.800
But you have no right to judge me.

1884
02:58:46.974 --> 02:58:51.979
It's impossible for words to describe...

1885
02:58:54.315 --> 02:58:57.484
what is necessary...

1886
02:58:59.486 --> 02:59:03.490
to those who do not know...

1887
02:59:04.825 --> 02:59:07.786
what horror means.

1888
02:59:10.122 --> 02:59:11.332
Horror.

1889
02:59:14.335 --> 02:59:16.962
Horror has a face.

1890
02:59:19.256 --> 02:59:21.383
And you must make a friend of horror.

1891
02:59:23.093 --> 02:59:27.932
Horror and moral terror are your friends.

1892
02:59:28.515 --> 02:59:33.312
If they are not,
then they are enemies to be feared.

1893
02:59:34.813 --> 02:59:36.690
They are truly enemies.

1894
02:59:41.695 --> 02:59:44.531
I remember when I was with Special Forces.

1895
02:59:49.036 --> 02:59:52.957
It seems a thousand centuries ago.

1896
02:59:56.543 --> 03:00:02.383
We went into a camp
to inoculate some children.

1897
03:00:06.971 --> 03:00:12.518
We'd left the camp after we had
inoculated the children for polio.

1898
03:00:14.979 --> 03:00:18.357
And this old man came running after us,
and he was crying, he couldn't see.

1899
03:00:21.944 --> 03:00:23.612
We went back there,

1900
03:00:24.571 --> 03:00:30.035
and they had come
and hacked off every inoculated arm.

1901
03:00:32.413 --> 03:00:35.833
There they were, in a pile. A pile...

1902
03:00:38.002 --> 03:00:39.253
of little arms.

1903
03:00:41.338 --> 03:00:43.590
And I remember...

1904
03:00:47.469 --> 03:00:50.264
I cried. I wept like...

1905
03:00:52.433 --> 03:00:55.102
some grandmother.

1906
03:00:57.271 --> 03:01:00.524
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

1907
03:01:02.276 --> 03:01:04.528
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

1908
03:01:05.404 --> 03:01:07.239
I never want to forget.

1909
03:01:08.907 --> 03:01:10.492
And then I realized...

1910
03:01:11.952 --> 03:01:16.290
like I was shot,
like I was shot with a diamond...

1911
03:01:17.499 --> 03:01:20.627
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

1912
03:01:22.713 --> 03:01:27.885
And I thought, "My God,
the genius of that. The genius.”

1913
03:01:29.303 --> 03:01:31.680
The will to do that...

1914
03:01:33.348 --> 03:01:37.811
perfect, genuine,
complete, crystalline, pure.

1915
03:01:40.397 --> 03:01:42.316
And then I realized

1916
03:01:42.399 --> 03:01:45.986
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

1917
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:50.032
These were not monsters.
These were men, trained cadres.

1918
03:01:51.492 --> 03:01:54.078
These men who fought with their hearts,

1919
03:01:54.161 --> 03:01:57.539
who have families, who have children,
who are filled with love...

1920
03:01:58.540 --> 03:02:00.292
but they have the strength...

1921
03:02:01.835 --> 03:02:03.337
the strength...

1922
03:02:07.299 --> 03:02:08.509
to do that.

1923
03:02:09.384 --> 03:02:13.680
If I had 10 divisions of those men...

1924
03:02:14.765 --> 03:02:17.726
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

1925
03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:23.941
You have to have men who are moral...

1926
03:02:26.276 --> 03:02:30.072
and at the same time, who are able...

1927
03:02:31.949 --> 03:02:38.205
to utilize
their primordial instincts to Kill...

1928
03:02:40.124 --> 03:02:42.084
without feeling, without passion...

1929
03:02:44.169 --> 03:02:46.672
without judgment. Without judgment.

1930
03:02:52.219 --> 03:02:54.847
Because it's judgment that defeats us.

1931
03:03:14.348 --> 03:03:21.147
I worry that my son might not
understand what I've tried to be.

1932
03:03:23.858 --> 03:03:28.487
And if I were to be killed, Willard...

1933
03:03:30.030 --> 03:03:35.494
I would want someone to go to
my home and tell my son everything.

1934
03:03:38.789 --> 03:03:41.751
Everything I did. Everything you saw.

1935
03:03:43.544 --> 03:03:49.049
Because there's nothing that I detest
more than the stench of lies.

1936
03:03:52.136 --> 03:03:59.143
And if you understand me, Willard,
you will do this for me.

1937
03:05:05.683 --> 03:05:07.852
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty. Over.

1938
03:05:09.646 --> 03:05:12.774
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. Over.

1939
03:05:15.026 --> 03:05:18.905
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. How do you copy?

1940
03:05:24.244 --> 03:05:27.038
They were gonna
make me a Major for this,

1941
03:05:27.789 --> 03:05:30.917
and I wasn't even
in their fucking Army any more.

1942
03:05:33.086 --> 03:05:35.046
Everybody wanted me to do it...

1943
03:05:36.673 --> 03:05:38.091
him most of all.

1944
03:05:39.759 --> 03:05:44.139
I felt like he was up there,
waiting for me to take the pain away.

1945
03:05:47.475 --> 03:05:49.853
He just wanted to go out like a soldier.

1946
03:05:50.687 --> 03:05:51.855
Standing up.

1947
03:05:52.897 --> 03:05:56.484
Not like some poor, wasted,
rag-assed renegade.

1948
03:06:00.363 --> 03:06:02.657
Even the jungle wanted him dead,

1949
03:06:03.616 --> 03:06:06.286
and that's who he really
took his orders from anyway.

1950
03:07:23.613 --> 03:07:28.826
"We train young men to drop fire
on people, but their commanders...

1951
03:07:30.036 --> 03:07:34.958
won't allow them to write 'Fuck!'
on their airplanes

1952
03:07:35.041 --> 03:07:38.044
because it's obscene!”

1953
03:09:01.252 --> 03:09:02.795
The horror.

1954
03:09:06.841 --> 03:09:08.217
The horror.

1955
03:14:31.248 --> 03:14:33.125
Calling PBR Street Gang.

1956
03:14:34.293 --> 03:14:38.255
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Do you read me? Over.

1957
03:14:38.798 --> 03:14:40.716
PBR Street Gang.

1958
03:14:41.647 --> 03:14:43.357
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty...

1959
03:15:21.687 --> 03:15:23.105
The horror.

1960
03:15:27.526 --> 03:15:28.903
The horror.
