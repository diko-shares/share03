1
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.641
Everyone has their path in life,

2
00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.337
and this is more or less
where mine started.

3
00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:50.849
My name is Norbit Albert Rice,
and I was an orphan.

4
00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.247
I like to think my parents
loved me very much,

5
00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.986
but just didn't have the means
to properly care for me.

6
00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:04.222
I can see them researching
all of the orphanages in the area,

7
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.230
agonizing over their choices,

8
00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.596
trying to make sure
their precious little boy

9
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.602
was raised in the perfect environment.

10
00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.120
Ling Ling! Someone left another one!

11
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.882
Coyotes, go! Get! Back! Back, coyotes!

12
00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.922
Get out here! You not eat another baby.

13
00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.798
Oh, crap. Another black one.

14
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.474
Can't give these away.

15
00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:57.214
You ugly black one, too.
You be here long time.

16
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.783
Nobody ever come and say,
"Give me the ugly, black one."

17
00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:04.081
You very ugly baby.
The ugliest baby I ever seen.

18
00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:07.221
A lot of people think
that orphanages are cold and scary,

19
00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:10.057
but the Golden Wonton
was a great place to grow up.

20
00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:13.860
We had everything
normal children had. Pets...

21
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.062
Here. Play with that.

22
00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:23.571
...a big backyard,
and lots of kids to play with.

23
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:27.276
Ling Ling!
The children got in MSG barrel.

24
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.348
Now all their hair gonna fall out again.

25
00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.680
You stupid orphan!
Nobody want a bald orphan!

26
00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:35.310
Norbit, how you find family with no hair?

27
00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.389
Nobody want a bald Norbit!

28
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.788
What the hell wrong
with the children here?

29
00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.259
Mr. Wong was a very interesting man.

30
00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:46.492
In addition to his love for children
and preparation of fine Asian cuisine,

31
00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.591
he had a real passion
for old-time whaling.

32
00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.670
It's a whale, ho!

33
00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:56.739
Die, you son-of-a!

34
00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:01.438
Bingo! Right in the blow hole!

35
00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:08.550
Norbit, where you go?
Why you run off like little bitch?

36
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:13.087
After Marvin Browning got lost
downtown for a couple of weeks,

37
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.354
the orphanage started using
a buddy system.

38
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.485
Go, Norbit!

39
00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.530
My buddy was little Kate.

40
00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:21.998
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

41
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:27.196
That's okay. You're doing good.

42
00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:35.904
Kate and I were always together.
Playing checkers...

43
00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:38.583
- Oh, man.
- Yes!

44
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.147
...watching scary movies.

45
00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:48.686
Why, we even pooped together.

46
00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.232
And then one day, Kate and I decided
that we should tie the knot.

47
00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:57.167
We got married
under the great big oak tree.

48
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.704
I now pronounce you my wife.

49
00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:04.402
And I pronounce you my husband.

50
00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.210
It's watermelon.

51
00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.378
Yours is green apple.

52
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.221
I think it's time for us to kiss now.

53
00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:24.189
And we lived happily ever after

54
00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:29.498
for about two weeks
until she got adopted.

55
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.435
Bye, Norbit.

56
00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:39.470
I didn't do too much bike riding
after that.

57
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.948
When Kate left, there was an
odd number of kids at the orphanage,

58
00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:47.986
so I was buddyless for a while.

59
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:51.952
And sometimes I'd get a little sad,

60
00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:59.262
but I never lost hope.

61
00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:03.631
I knew that someday I'd find
another somebody to share my life with.

62
00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:07.035
All I had to do was just be patient.

63
00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:13.007
- What'd you do that for?
- Because we felt like it.

64
00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.512
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What are you gonna do about it?

65
00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:16.582
Loser.

66
00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.380
Stop it.

67
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.793
Leave him alone.

68
00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:30.829
- Says who?
- Says who?

69
00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:37.635
- Who are you?
- Rasputia. What's your name?

70
00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:42.465
- Norbit.
- Norbit? That's a stupid name.

71
00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:46.040
- Why'd you beat those boys up?
- To protect you.

72
00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:49.945
- You got a girlfriend, Nesbit?
- Norbit.

73
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.912
No.

74
00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:55.977
Well, you do now.
Get your ass up and hold my hand.

75
00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:59.122
- Okay.
- How you doing?

76
00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:03.989
Everything changed
once I had Rasputia as my girlfriend.

77
00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.224
We took care of each other,

78
00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.860
and the other kids
started to respect me.

79
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.528
I'll take...

80
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.514
- Norbit.
- Come on.

81
00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:27.752
And because of Rasputia,
for the first time in my life,

82
00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:30.914
I had a real family.

83
00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:33.218
Rasputia had three brothers.

84
00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.817
Big Black Jack. He was the oldest.

85
00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.088
Leg.

86
00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:41.465
Then, there was Blue.

87
00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:43.958
Breasts.

88
00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.968
And Earl. He was the baby.

89
00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.336
Wing.

90
00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:52.641
They sure loved their little sister,

91
00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:55.043
and so they treated me
like one of their own.

92
00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:58.015
Here you go, Norbit.
Saved the best piece for you.

93
00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:02.117
- What's that?
- Turkey ass. Eat up, sucker.

94
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.017
Bon appetitty.

95
00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.283
Bon appetitty.

96
00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:10.926
The Latimores had a reputation

97
00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:13.964
for being the meanest,
nastiest people in town,

98
00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:16.728
but that's just because
folks didn't know them.

99
00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.498
They were actually
very nice, hard-working people.

100
00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:22.805
They ran
the local construction company,

101
00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:25.936
and recently, responding to the needs
of the community...

102
00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:27.034
Yo, Morris.

103
00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:29.944
...had opened a little security business.

104
00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:33.916
It was a surprisingly popular service
among the local vendors.

105
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.751
Hey, you don't shake me down.
I'm Italian. I shake you down.

106
00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:39.381
- Is that right?
- Yes.

107
00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:41.221
Get his ass in here.

108
00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:49.659
I'm in.

109
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:56.272
As time passed,
Rasputia and I got closer and closer,

110
00:07:56.809 --> 00:08:01.109
in high school and as adults.

111
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.918
I started working as a bookkeeper
in her family's business.

112
00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:09.587
I'm expecting
some important calls today, Norbit,

113
00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.324
so when you answer the phone,
try and sound white.

114
00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:11.915
so when you answer the phone,
try and sound white.

115
00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:14.652
It was like everything was
finally coming together.

116
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.727
Yes.

117
00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:19.626
Of course,
it was only natural that Rasputia and I

118
00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:22.326
would take the next step
in our relationship.

119
00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:25.962
I now pronounce you man and wife.

120
00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.232
You may kiss the bride.

121
00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:57.095
Open your mouth.

122
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.771
Go, Rasputia!

123
00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:11.806
It was a storybook wedding,

124
00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:14.648
the beginning of a brand-new chapter.

125
00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:21.092
I knew I would never be lonely again.
I had found my place in the world.

126
00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:24.187
Poor Norbit. Man.

127
00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:27.766
Back when I was in the game,
I used to tell my hos,

128
00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:32.566
"Hos, ain't no man gonna pay for
the cow if he can get the milk for free."

129
00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:35.106
You ain't got to worry
about this brother buying the milk,

130
00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:38.005
'cause he just bought
the whole damn cow.

131
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.943
That's a special cow, too.

132
00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:41.843
That must be
where buttermilk come from.

133
00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:43.506
Sing that shit, girl.

134
00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:46.481
Them are not dimples.
Them are potholes in her ass.

135
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.884
Look like an Escalade
in a wedding dress.

136
00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:55.593
It a horror show.

137
00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.994
Norbit. What a woman you got.

138
00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.032
- Hi, fellows.
- We're all jealous, right, boys?

139
00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:04.625
- Oh, yeah. Way jealous.
- Wish I had one like that.

140
00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:07.672
Norbit, let me talk to you for a second.

141
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.134
Look, just so we clear.

142
00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:16.680
If you ever hurt my sister in any way,

143
00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:21.515
make her cry,
even make her sad one time,

144
00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:26.249
I'm coming at you
with razor blades and lemon juice.

145
00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.455
- You hear me?
- Yes.

146
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.620
I'm talking pain, boy.

147
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.893
Searing, mind-numbing pain.

148
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.467
I understand.

149
00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.763
- You understand me?
- Yes, yes, yes.

150
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.167
All right.

151
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.604
- Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

152
00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:50.707
Somebody is take
a big hunk out of my cake!

153
00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:58.584
What y'all looking at?
I ain't had no cake.

154
00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.285
You better mind your damn business.

155
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:10.631
Hey, hey! Everyone!

156
00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:13.364
I am Mr. Wong.
I am best man in wedding.

157
00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:18.842
I feel it my place to say something,
make a toast to bride and groom,

158
00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:21.845
tell story about Norbit.
I like Norbit father.

159
00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:24.575
I raise Norbit. He like my own child.

160
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:28.085
And I want to say that
I very, very confused, Norbit,

161
00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.485
that you... You marry Latimore.

162
00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:34.389
I don't understand it, because
when you was a little boy, you say,

163
00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:39.829
"One day I find the girl of my dreams."
And then you marry a gorilla.

164
00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.559
I joke, I joke, I joke.

165
00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.603
Why you not know joke
when you hear joke?

166
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:48.265
Why you wanna make fight at wedding?

167
00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:52.743
Cool off, before I have to
bust somebody ass in here. Okay.

168
00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:55.642
When Norbit just little boy,

169
00:11:55.748 --> 00:12:01.050
he like to always
run all over place naked. Always naked.

170
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.818
And Norbit, when he was just little boy,
had a pee-pee the size of an egg roll.

171
00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:10.189
- You know, Norbit.
- That's true.

172
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:14.093
And one day, down by creek,
Norbit run around naked

173
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.102
and poisonous snake jump up
and bite Norbit right on ass.

174
00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:21.940
Very close to hole.

175
00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:27.068
Norbit pass out. I think Norbit is dead.

176
00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:31.309
I go to check the boy pulse.
He still alive. He still alive!

177
00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:35.080
"Okay," I say,
"I must do something to save child."

178
00:12:35.187 --> 00:12:37.212
So, I start to think,

179
00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:43.284
"Do I suck poison out of Norbit's ass
or do I let him die?"

180
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.858
I do the most responsible thing.

181
00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:51.959
I say, "Hell to the no!

182
00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.971
"Norbit is out of here,

183
00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:55.973
"because it is long time in hell

184
00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:59.442
"before Wong suck poison
out of another man's ass."

185
00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:06.415
But strange, mystical thing
happen, Norbit.

186
00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:09.613
Even though poison is in Norbit,
he not die.

187
00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:13.180
Norbit get stronger and stronger.

188
00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:17.695
That why I know, Norbit,
deep down inside, you very, very strong.

189
00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.890
You strong like warrior.

190
00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:23.230
That's why I say to you, Norbit,
you can survive anything.

191
00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:24.899
Even...

192
00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:30.002
So I say to everyone here, and to Norbit,

193
00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:34.739
I wish you much happiness and peace
and love,

194
00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:39.477
and lots of bananas for your new gorilla.

195
00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:42.520
I only kidding. To Norbit and Rasputia.

196
00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.086
Norbit, you know
what would be so romantic?

197
00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:50.253
If you'd carry me over the threshold
like a little chocolate drop.

198
00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:56.396
Be delicate, now.

199
00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.937
Put your back into it.

200
00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:06.473
Come on, now. Be a man.
You ain't no man.

201
00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:08.610
Pathetic.

202
00:14:12.284 --> 00:14:16.186
Rasputia, I know we're both nervous
because we've never done this before,

203
00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:19.815
but we can take our time, darling.
In sweet time.

204
00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:29.499
Rasputia was so full of love.

205
00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:33.502
Merry Christmas!

206
00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.404
Ho, ho, ho!

207
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:40.034
It was a love that sustained us
through the years.

208
00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:41.237
Halt!

209
00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:46.843
187. Officer down.

210
00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:49.147
And it's still going strong.

211
00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:51.647
Happy Presidents' Day!

212
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.490
God bless America.

213
00:14:57.796 --> 00:15:02.631
And so, we began our life together,
like any other happily married couple.

214
00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:04.462
Morning, Rasputia.

215
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.060
"Morning, Rasputia," my ass.

216
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:08.298
I tell you what. You better do something
about that goddamn dog,

217
00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.567
because I ain't gonna be
getting terrorized

218
00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:10.972
by no dog on my own property.

219
00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:13.271
I'm sick of it! I'm gonna go out
and purchase me a pellet rifle!

220
00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:14.846
And then I'm gonna give him
something to bark about

221
00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:18.508
when I start popping pellets
in his little bug-eyed bastard's ass.

222
00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:23.076
Messing around with you,
now I'm gonna be late for dance class.

223
00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:30.353
God damn it, Norbit.

224
00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:33.454
How many times I got to tell you, when
you drive my car, don't adjust my seat!

225
00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:36.966
- I haven't touched your seat.
- Then why is it up so damn far?

226
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:40.266
It looks like it's back
as far as it goes, Rasputia.

227
00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:41.905
No, you moved it. I can tell, 'cause look,

228
00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:44.942
when I inhale,
my titty make the horn honk. Listen.

229
00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.306
You see that?

230
00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:50.145
- That ain't right.
- I hear it.

231
00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:53.343
That scientifically prove
that you was adjusting my seat.

232
00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.545
- That's not science.
- It is. Now just let it go.

233
00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:58.054
- It's not science.
- I said let it go.

234
00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:00.853
- I'm just...
- I said it was science, God damn it.

235
00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:10.357
Why you think I want to sell
Golden Wonton Restaurant?

236
00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:11.663
I got a good business.

237
00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.295
It practically run itself.
I make a lot of money here.

238
00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:20.675
Every man got a price.
We think this might be yours.

239
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:38.930
And here is my counteroffer.

240
00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:49.001
- Excuse me.
- All right, it's go time.

241
00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:56.876
I not like rest of town people.
I not intimidated by Latimore.

242
00:16:56.982 --> 00:17:00.782
- You wrong, Wong. Relax, man.
- Be cool with that thing, Mr. Wong.

243
00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:02.581
Ling Ling, get my pistol!

244
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.748
That dude is crazy.
Let's get the hell out of here!

245
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:09.419
I never sell to Latimore! Ever! Ever!

246
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:15.463
All right! Y'all ready, class?
Are y'all ready?

247
00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:19.162
We gonna perforate!
We gonna penetrate!

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:20.802
We gonna percolate!

249
00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:22.671
We gonna palpitate!

250
00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:28.039
All because we wanna master the bate,
the art of power-tap the fat.

251
00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:31.383
Come on, and power-tap the fat.
Take that, power-tap the fat.

252
00:17:31.483 --> 00:17:33.314
Hey, you get your skinny ass
out of my way.

253
00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:36.149
One, two, three, four.
I stepped in poo, better wipe it off.

254
00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:39.383
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

255
00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:43.154
I stepped in poo, better wipe it off.
One, two, three, four.

256
00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:46.288
Ride the horse. Ride the horse!

257
00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:51.465
Keep bucking, y'all!
Keep bucking! And slide!

258
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.768
Click clackety clack! Come on, slide!
Click clackety clack! Just slide!

259
00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:59.275
Here come the cops.

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:02.677
They take me to jail.
They take me to jail.

261
00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:06.114
Riverdance. Come on, white people.
Riverdance. Come on, white people.

262
00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:07.947
Riverdance. Come on.

263
00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:09.918
Now, pump, pump, pump, pump,
pump me up.

264
00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:11.614
Pump, pump, pump, pump,
pump me down.

265
00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:17.252
And one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

266
00:18:17.362 --> 00:18:20.627
And stretch it out.
Work your whole bicuspids area,

267
00:18:20.732 --> 00:18:24.600
your whole bilaterals and bisexuals.
Very good.

268
00:18:24.703 --> 00:18:26.068
Excuse me, Buster?

269
00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:27.798
I think I need
a little adjustment over here.

270
00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:30.033
Look at you,
looking like the Great Pumpkin, girl.

271
00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:31.939
Trick or treat. What's going on?

272
00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:35.275
Well, see, I was born with a trick hip
and it made me real bendy.

273
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.871
See, I'm just like licorice. Look.

274
00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:41.309
Goddamn, girl,
that look like the harvest moon.

275
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.651
- Turn a brother to a werewolf.
- You just need to stop.

276
00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:48.021
You know what?
Do you do any private lessons?

277
00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:52.158
I could do private lessons
if you could do me a little favor.

278
00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:53.322
What's that?

279
00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:58.062
Just need you talk to your little brothers
about funding my little video tape.

280
00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.933
I'm trying to make power-tap
more international.

281
00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:01.596
I'm trying to be like Billy Blanks,

282
00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:03.299
but double the money
and half the Blank.

283
00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:05.103
That's a good idea.

284
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.340
Maybe I will, maybe I will.
But, first, I got to get that private lesson.

285
00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:11.541
Okay. Call me, girl.

286
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.619
- I'll call you.
- I'll be your private dancer.

287
00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.287
- Must be Saturday.
- Why is that?

288
00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:23.186
Because here come Norbit,
right on schedule.

289
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:26.190
Almost set your watch to him.

290
00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:30.661
Hey, Pope Sweet Jesus
and Lord Have Mercy.

291
00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:31.963
How you guys doing, fellows?

292
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.094
Business is good.

293
00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:35.730
Business is good.
It's almost like the good old days.

294
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:36.808
Yes, indeedy.

295
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.171
What do you mean,
"the good old days"?

296
00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:40.837
The good old days, man,
back when we was pimping, Norbit.

297
00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:41.935
You know.

298
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.342
- You guys used to pimp?
- "Used to"?

299
00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:46.747
That's a violation. Still pimping.
Once a pimp, always a pimp.

300
00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:49.013
- Always. Forever.
- Boss player.

301
00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.322
Rasputia sent me down here
to get the usual.

302
00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:52.447
You guys are open, right?

303
00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:54.582
We always open.
Go on and take yourself in there, Norbit.

304
00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:55.887
We'll stack that up for you.

305
00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:00.993
- Moniqua!
- Yes, Daddy.

306
00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:04.557
Can you get King Kong
three large buckets, extra sauce?

307
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.160
- Please don't trim the fat.
- Yes, Daddy.

308
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:08.466
Please don't trim that fat.
She will kill me.

309
00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:10.098
Norbit, while I got your attention,

310
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:13.440
can I interest you in some new shoes,
maybe a haircut?

311
00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:15.513
How about a bath or a sink?

312
00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:18.276
Hey, don't tell me
you guys bought the bath store, too?

313
00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.715
It's a perfect fit, man.
We used to sell bitches to johns.

314
00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:23.287
Now we selling johns to bitches.

315
00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:26.585
- Beds, bitches, and beyond!
- Sound like money to me.

316
00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:27.716
No, thanks, guys.

317
00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:30.021
I got to go do a puppet show
for the kids at the orphanage.

318
00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:31.095
At the orphanage?

319
00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:33.460
That's a nice thing you do
for them little kids over there.

320
00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:35.089
Why don't you take
these little tater puffs

321
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.462
over there to them little children?

322
00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:39.332
Oh, that's great, guys. That's sweet.

323
00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:42.100
Wait, my puppets! I forgot my puppets!

324
00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:43.674
I got to go. I got to go, guys.

325
00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:45.640
- Where's his puppets?
- He ain't got no puppets.

326
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.380
What's Rasputia doing home so early?

327
00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.553
'Sputia?

328
00:21:03.028 --> 00:21:04.052
Oh, yeah, girl.

329
00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:05.754
Come on, girl, that's sweet chocolate!

330
00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:08.492
Okay, you in trouble, now.
You in trouble. You in trouble, now.

331
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.865
I'm Willy Wonka.
Get up on that Oompa Loompa.

332
00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:19.310
That's sweet. Oh, yeah.
Take all that, girl.

333
00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:22.107
Take it with your big old self, girl.
You ain't never had it like this.

334
00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:24.444
You ain't never had it like this!

335
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:26.278
Hell, yeah.
Come on, we gonna do pig in a blanket.

336
00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:27.750
Come on, pig in a blanket.

337
00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:30.481
- Now squeal. Squeal! Squeal!
- Oink, oink, oink!

338
00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:31.647
Take it from the back.

339
00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:35.488
Damn, I feel like Willy Wonka,
all this sweet chocolate up in this...

340
00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:42.056
Hey. How you doing, man?
What's good with you, brother?

341
00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:44.294
How's it going, man? How you doing?

342
00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:46.428
I'm Bust-a-move Perkin.
How you doing?

343
00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:48.130
Man, your wife was
just talking about you.

344
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.935
Man, she love you.

345
00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:55.207
- You're Rasputia's tap dance teacher.
- Man, actually, I'm her power-tap guru.

346
00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.942
I was just here
giving her a little tap lesson.

347
00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.745
But you're naked.

348
00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:02.384
That's just so she could see
the various muscle groups

349
00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:03.818
as I go through the various routines.

350
00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:07.517
You see that there?
You can't see that with a turtleneck.

351
00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:10.651
And you have an...

352
00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:13.822
Oh, man,
I'm just real passionate about dance.

353
00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:16.594
You can say the word "dance"
and he just jump up. Dance!

354
00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:18.431
See that? See that there?

355
00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:19.796
'Sputia?

356
00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:21.896
Norbit, Buster's a guest in our home.

357
00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.668
How dare you insinuate
something like that?

358
00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:25.333
Yeah, Orbit!

359
00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:28.709
How dare you insinuate
something such like that!

360
00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:33.547
You know, I am actually offended
by your accusization, you understand?

361
00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:37.019
And rather than sit here and have
a belligerent confrontation with you,

362
00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:39.590
'cause I am a God-fearing man,

363
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:44.060
I'm'a do like Jesus H. Christ
would do in a situation such as such

364
00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:46.960
and I'm gonna turn the other cheek.

365
00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:48.362
Amen.

366
00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:54.995
You happy now?

367
00:22:55.107 --> 00:22:57.075
Rasputia, you cheated on me!

368
00:22:57.175 --> 00:22:58.802
Look, I told your ass
ain't nothing happened,

369
00:22:58.910 --> 00:22:59.968
and the next time you say
it happened again,

370
00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:02.512
I'm gonna knock your teeth
out your mouth.

371
00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:05.675
Rasputia, we took vows.
I'm your husband.

372
00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:10.182
Rasputia, we took vows,
and you cheated on me!

373
00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:12.387
It never happened!

374
00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:15.551
Yes, it did!

375
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.721
And that makes you
the queen of whores!

376
00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:26.670
Hey, Norbit!

377
00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:35.737
Run for your lives!

378
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.112
Bastard! Come here!

379
00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:45.019
Oh, sweet Moses! Oh, my God!

380
00:23:45.123 --> 00:23:47.489
Come here! Come here!
Come here to me!

381
00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:48.752
No! Leave me alone!

382
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.487
You ain't nothing
but a goddamn coward!

383
00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:51.960
Saddle tramp!

384
00:23:57.803 --> 00:24:00.067
That's what your stupid black ass get!

385
00:24:00.172 --> 00:24:02.265
I hope you broke your ass!

386
00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:05.533
Since you feel like running, Norbit,

387
00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:08.477
why don't you run your ass
down to the Rib Shak

388
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.982
and get me a short stack of ribs?

389
00:24:10.982 --> 00:24:11.812
and get me a short stack of ribs?

390
00:24:11.917 --> 00:24:14.477
Extra hot sauce.

391
00:24:14.586 --> 00:24:17.987
All this setting you straight
done got me famished.

392
00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:27.990
I'm Little Red Riding Goose,

393
00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:30.727
walking through the forest,
minding my own business,

394
00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:32.701
when all at once...

395
00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:33.930
Hello.

396
00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:37.702
- Who are you?
- I'm the big, bad pig of the forest.

397
00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:40.573
My, what big eyes you have, Pig.

398
00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:42.670
The better to see you with, Goose.

399
00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:46.046
And my, what a big nose you have, Pig.

400
00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:49.780
The better to smell them scrumptious
goodies you got in your basket.

401
00:24:49.888 --> 00:24:52.516
Hey, let me take a look in there.

402
00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:56.788
Oh, no, you don't.
You're gonna try to steal my food.

403
00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.328
No, I won't steal your food.

404
00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.228
Don't let that pig
push you around, Goose.

405
00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:04.461
Yeah, I'm tired of
you pushing me around.

406
00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:06.628
Look, I'm tired of
playing with your ass, bitch.

407
00:25:06.738 --> 00:25:08.330
I know you got ribs in that basket.

408
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.805
You better give them up smooth

409
00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:12.342
or I'm gonna break my hoof off
in your goose ass.

410
00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:15.208
Oh, really? Well, why don't you get up
off of your lazy behind

411
00:25:15.313 --> 00:25:17.440
and go down to the Rib Shak
and get your own ribs?

412
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:20.177
Or better still,
why don't you just call Buster

413
00:25:20.285 --> 00:25:22.378
and tell him to come over
and power-tap you,

414
00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:24.614
because in addition to being
the pig of the forest,

415
00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:27.521
you're also a saddle tramp,
whore, bitch pig...

416
00:25:27.626 --> 00:25:31.756
Norbit! What you doing?
This supposed to be a children's show.

417
00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:35.890
This remind me
of Chinese snuff film I once co-star in.

418
00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:39.437
I'm sorry. I got a little carried away.

419
00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:42.607
Wow, Norbit,
that was some puppet show.

420
00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:48.176
Oh, come on. You don't remember me?

421
00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:53.408
- Kate. Kate.
- Come here!

422
00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:56.976
Kate! Kate! Oh, God!
I can't believe it! Kate!

423
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:59.348
Well, can I have a hug?

424
00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:03.717
Norbit.

425
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.491
It just like old times.

426
00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:10.295
Maybe you two go take poop together.

427
00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:19.103
This place has not changed at all.

428
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.976
Oh, yeah. Some of this furniture's
even come back in style.

429
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:25.345
So, how long are
you gonna be visiting for?

430
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.680
No, I'm not visiting. I'm moving back.

431
00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:30.619
Really? Wow.

432
00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:33.418
I sold my clothing business in Atlanta,

433
00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:36.722
and I'm going to use the money
to buy the orphanage.

434
00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.261
What?

435
00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:43.334
Mr. Wong's getting older.
He wants to go whaling, so...

436
00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:47.829
You know, it's always been my dream
to come back here and take over.

437
00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:49.937
That's great.

438
00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:53.110
Norbit, look.

439
00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:57.676
That's the tree we got married under.

440
00:26:59.918 --> 00:27:02.443
You know, I've still got my ring.

441
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.218
I ate mine.

442
00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:09.485
I missed you so much when you left.

443
00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.592
I missed you, too.

444
00:27:15.066 --> 00:27:16.658
That's my car.

445
00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:20.967
We didn't really get a chance
to catch up much.

446
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.508
I'll be back in town on Tuesday.
You wanna have lunch?

447
00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:28.638
Yeah, I would love to
have lunch on Tuesday.

448
00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:29.975
- I love lunch.
- Okay.

449
00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:33.812
Lunch, yes. For sure.
I love lunch. Tuesday.

450
00:27:34.285 --> 00:27:35.343
I'll see you Tuesday.

451
00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:39.048
I'll see you on Tuesday.
We'll have lunch on Tuesday.

452
00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:41.549
Tuesday.

453
00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:44.689
Tuesday. Tuesday.

454
00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:48.459
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday.

455
00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:52.499
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday...

456
00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:56.404
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday, Tuesday...

457
00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:04.238
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

458
00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:07.512
Tuesday, Tuesday...

459
00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:11.555
Say "Tuesday" again
and you ain't gonna see Wednesday!

460
00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:13.783
I got it. I'll get it. Tuesday.

461
00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:17.223
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

462
00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:19.960
- Buster. How you doing? You look great.
- Hey.

463
00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:22.226
- Oh, thank you, man.
- Good to see you. Good to see you.

464
00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:24.324
Thank you.
I thought you were gonna be at work.

465
00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:25.698
Yeah, I'm on my way out now.

466
00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:27.965
But hey, look,
there's cold beer in the refrigerator

467
00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:30.200
and there's fresh sheets on the bed.
Go have a great dance lesson.

468
00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:31.468
- All right.
- All right.

469
00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:32.804
Power-tap.

470
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:35.709
Very good, very good.

471
00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:39.183
Tuesday.

472
00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:44.878
What's wrong with your boy?
He real cool all of a sudden.

473
00:28:44.989 --> 00:28:48.823
Yeah, I don't know what the hell got
into him, but I know I got dance fever.

474
00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:51.395
Ready for a little power-tap, huh?

475
00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:54.628
Lord, give me strength.

476
00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:56.958
Hey, Sam, happy Tuesday.

477
00:28:57.068 --> 00:28:58.228
Norbit.

478
00:28:58.336 --> 00:28:59.462
Norbit.

479
00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:02.438
- Hey, Kate. Hi.
- Come on, I got us a table.

480
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.235
Great. I've been looking forward to this
all week.

481
00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:05.809
Good.

482
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.537
Hey.

483
00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:09.237
Hey. Who's he?

484
00:29:09.347 --> 00:29:11.406
Norbit, this is my fiancé, Deion Hughes.

485
00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:14.508
How you doing, my man?
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

486
00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:16.746
- This is your fiancé?
- Yes, sir.

487
00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:19.688
I was just telling Deion that you and I
were buddy partners at the orphanage.

488
00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.725
Now she and I are buddy partners.

489
00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:25.762
Shame on you, man,
letting a girl go like this. I feel for you.

490
00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:28.332
And so Deion's got all this experience
in real estate,

491
00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:31.368
so he's going to help me buy
the orphanage, Norbit. It's so exciting!

492
00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:33.198
No, wait, wait. No, no.
Slow down, slow down.

493
00:29:33.304 --> 00:29:35.966
I mean, you know,
we're just out here just scouting it out.

494
00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:38.133
All right? This is her nest egg,
you know.

495
00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:39.904
I don't want her
making any hasty decisions

496
00:29:40.011 --> 00:29:41.808
that she might regret later, you know?

497
00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:44.438
She worked too hard for this money,
man, you know what I mean?

498
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:47.074
Deion, you take
such good care of me, baby.

499
00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:49.847
It's my job. Stop it.

500
00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:51.987
Okay?

501
00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:59.286
Don't you just love Tuesdays?

502
00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:08.362
Lloyd, just tell me why it has to hurt
so GD much.

503
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:14.401
What's the matter, boy?

504
00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:18.573
You sensing an earthquake
or some other sort of natural disaster?

505
00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:25.886
That's just my...

506
00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:27.821
My wife.

507
00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:40.230
A man needs his own space.

508
00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:53.611
Finally! For the love of Cain.

509
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:01.058
Moses!

510
00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:05.328
I'll see you suckers
tomorrow at the picnic!

511
00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:22.479
Damn it, Norbit!
How many times I got to tell you,

512
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.911
don't be messing with my car seat!

513
00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:25.880
Nobody touched your old, stupid seat.

514
00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:29.351
Then how come
it's all mushed up like this, then?

515
00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:31.422
Well, you know, Rasputia,
you've been eating so much lately

516
00:31:31.522 --> 00:31:36.118
there's a very strong possibility that...
The car is shrinking.

517
00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:39.219
Might be shrinking.
The car is being smaller.

518
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:44.029
Yeah, you might be right. Been raining
a lot lately. All this moist weather.

519
00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:47.662
- Oh, yeah? That'll make it shrink.
- This weather's so moist.

520
00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:55.706
How you doing?

521
00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:03.485
Don't cha wish your girlfriend
was hot like me

522
00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:06.386
Don't cha wish your girlfriend
was a freak like me

523
00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.188
Don't cha

524
00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:12.329
Look at that dog over there,
eyeballing me.

525
00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:15.126
Rasputia, what are you doing?

526
00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:16.495
Shut up!

527
00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:20.799
- Hey, slow down! You're gonna hit him!
- I got you now. I got you now!

528
00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:25.800
- Stop it! No!
- I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

529
00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:29.073
Rasputia, don't! No! No! No!

530
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.955
I know what that sound means!

531
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:37.387
I know what that sound means!

532
00:32:37.488 --> 00:32:39.718
Bark! How you doing!

533
00:32:39.824 --> 00:32:41.018
Lloyd!

534
00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:44.220
Enough is enough.

535
00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:47.355
Now, where in the hell
do you think you're going?

536
00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:49.326
Lloyd's in the hospital because of you!

537
00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:51.459
Yeah, that's right.
I put his little dog ass in the hospital.

538
00:32:51.569 --> 00:32:54.163
And I'd have put it in the morgue, too,
if you didn't mess with my car seat.

539
00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:55.671
It threw off my driving skills.

540
00:32:55.773 --> 00:33:02.303
Rasputia, you are a mean, selfish, cold,
heartless woman, and I am leaving you!

541
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.505
- You leaving me?
- Yes!

542
00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:07.012
Well, where the hell
you think you're going, big shot?

543
00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:08.847
You ain't got no money.
You ain't got no family.

544
00:33:08.953 --> 00:33:10.545
Everything is in my name, the car,
the house...

545
00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:13.146
You ain't nothing and you ain't gonna
never be nothing without me, Norbit!

546
00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:17.193
Norbit, you just can't leave!
Norbit, please, I'm with child!

547
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.257
With child?

548
00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:25.803
Oh, yes, Norbit, can't you tell?
I'm getting a little belly.

549
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:29.897
And my titties is all achy and itchy-like.

550
00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:33.340
Oh, Norbit, we gonna be a family.

551
00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:40.178
Oh, Norbit, come hug me,
Daddy, please.

552
00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:44.919
Please, Norbit.

553
00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:05.867
I understand, little pony.

554
00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:08.669
I know your pain.

555
00:34:10.014 --> 00:34:11.914
Oh, yes, I know.

556
00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:16.076
Excuse me, snow bunny.

557
00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:19.588
I don't come in your jurisdiction,
throwing town picnics.

558
00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:23.626
Yet here you is all up in mines,
pimping hos.

559
00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:25.360
It's just a kissing booth.

560
00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:29.194
Call it what you will,
but Pope Sweet Jesus

561
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.961
is taking half.

562
00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:34.564
You work for me now, ho.

563
00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:36.929
Sure.

564
00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:38.440
Let me taste the goods.

565
00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:39.976
Put it on me.

566
00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:42.974
- Greasy.
- Greasy.

567
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:44.912
We back in business.

568
00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:50.345
I wanna be a ho. How do I apply?

569
00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:54.684
Please, Lord Jesus, help me!
Look, look, tickets! Hey, tickets, tickets.

570
00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:56.384
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Line up with your buddy.

571
00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:57.654
Line up with your buddy.

572
00:34:57.762 --> 00:34:59.195
- You got one, sweetie.
- Can we go on the jumper?

573
00:34:59.297 --> 00:35:00.286
Yeah, yeah, you go.

574
00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:03.367
Baby, you know I love you.
I love these kids.

575
00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:05.493
It's just that
I don't think buying an orphanage

576
00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:08.697
is the right move financially right now.
That's all.

577
00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:10.865
Hey, this is not
a financial decision, Deion.

578
00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:13.341
- I thought you understood that, baby.
- No. No, I do. I do, baby.

579
00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:16.174
But this the call I was telling you...
The business call, it's very important.

580
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.145
Let's talk about it
when I get back to the house, okay?

581
00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:19.477
You're not going to stay?

582
00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:21.916
No, very important. Here.

583
00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:27.052
Hello? It's never a bad time for you.

584
00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:30.683
Stop it! Stop!

585
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.092
Norbit!

586
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.293
- Hey.
- Hi.

587
00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:37.000
Hey.

588
00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:39.797
- I didn't know you were gonna be here.
- Oh, yeah.

589
00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:42.236
Hey, you know, I just saw Deion leaving.

590
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.641
He had some business to take care of.

591
00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:48.771
So, who are you here with?

592
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.038
My wife.

593
00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:58.082
- Norbit, I didn't know you were married.
- Yeah.

594
00:35:58.189 --> 00:36:02.216
- Well, that's wonderful. Really.
- Thank you so much.

595
00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:03.987
So, where is she?

596
00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:08.163
Right over there in the print outfit.

597
00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:11.201
The one talking to the girl by the bench?

598
00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:15.033
No, the one sucking the jelly
out of them donuts.

599
00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:21.811
Oh, yeah. She's pretty.

600
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.944
That's cherry.
Is that cherry or strawberry?

601
00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:27.574
What are my kids doing? Peter! Theo!

602
00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:30.051
I don't want you bothering anyone.

603
00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:32.890
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Rice.

604
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.185
Mrs. Rice?
My name ain't no damn Mrs. Rice.

605
00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:37.693
Oh, I just thought
'cause you're married to Norbit...

606
00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:38.921
Who the hell are you?

607
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.090
Kate, this is my wife,
Rasputia Latimore,

608
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.599
and, Rasputia, this is Kate.

609
00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:46.398
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

610
00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:48.734
Kate's an old friend of mine
from the orphanage.

611
00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:51.569
Latimore, as in Latimore Construction?

612
00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:53.507
Yes, that's right,
as in Latimore Construction.

613
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:54.873
That's right. Why?

614
00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:56.344
Well, just that this is perfect,

615
00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:59.939
'cause I was going to come see
you guys about a renovation of...

616
00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:01.651
I ain't come out here for that.

617
00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:04.084
I'm out here to enjoy these festivities,
not to be talking no business.

618
00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:05.678
You wanna talk business,
my brother is Big Black Jack

619
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:06.757
over there by the BB guns.

620
00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:08.586
Go over there and talk to him.
I ain't got no time for this.

621
00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:10.456
Oh, sure, okay.

622
00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:12.290
Well, go on, get.

623
00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:15.126
- Okay.
- Okay.

624
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.166
- Come here.
- What, Rasputia?

625
00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:24.741
You thinking about creeping, ain't you?

626
00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:25.934
We're just friends.

627
00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:28.739
What'd I tell you about having friends?

628
00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:30.370
Go over there
and get me another wine cooler.

629
00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:32.745
It's hot as hell out here.
Don't you see I'm sweltering?

630
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:36.445
- Rasputia, you can't drink wine.
- Why the hell not?

631
00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:41.224
- You're with child.
- With child? I ain't with no...

632
00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:46.328
Oh, that was... I had gas. I still got it.

633
00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:51.557
There's your child.
Now, go get me something to drink.

634
00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:01.308
Twins!

635
00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:03.673
Hey! You come back here!

636
00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.811
- Oh, my God!
- Move your fat ass, boy.

637
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.150
Look, you got one!

638
00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.692
Get him. Get him, Big Black.

639
00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:19.829
Are you Big Black Jack?

640
00:38:20.197 --> 00:38:21.824
What it look like?

641
00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:24.298
Oh, well.

642
00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:27.530
Me and my fiancé
are buying the Golden Wonton...

643
00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:30.971
Wong's place? He's selling it to you?

644
00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:33.600
Yeah. Why is that surprising?

645
00:38:33.711 --> 00:38:35.872
Miss Thomas, Miss Thomas, let's go.
They're starting the music.

646
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.447
- Oh, great!
- Come on. Let's go.

647
00:38:37.548 --> 00:38:40.039
Can we finish this up later?
Apparently I have to go dance now.

648
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.642
All right, baby. You go dance now.

649
00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:46.287
The orphanage is in play.

650
00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:52.121
Y'all better give me my hat.
Give me the hat!

651
00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:53.662
Here, take her hat.

652
00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:57.493
You think I won't come up in here?
I'm gonna come up in here.

653
00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:07.733
You think I'm playing?

654
00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:09.574
Give me the hat right now,
or I'm gonna tear your leg off.

655
00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:12.409
Hey, Norbit, come on!

656
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.485
Oh, no. No, I can't.
Rasputia's waiting for me.

657
00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:17.918
- Come on, dance with us.
- No, really, I shouldn't...

658
00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:21.617
Don't think I won't kill a child.
I'll kill a child in front of everybody.

659
00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.626
Little street urchins.

660
00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:29.087
Okay. That's it.
Now it's time to bring the pain.

661
00:39:36.173 --> 00:39:38.664
Dance, Norbit, dance! Come on!

662
00:39:43.447 --> 00:39:44.573
My hat!

663
00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.878
It's raining little white women.

664
00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:52.888
My prayers have been answered!

665
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.050
She'd better move,
'cause my prayer is for a Cadillac.

666
00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.534
You little bastards.

667
00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:14.540
Where the hell is Norbit
with that wine cooler?

668
00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:16.442
I'm thirsty as hell.

669
00:40:25.956 --> 00:40:27.446
Oh, hell, no.

670
00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.119
Oh, he's lost his mind.

671
00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:35.221
Bitch, that's my wine cooler!

672
00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:38.529
It's my birthday! It's my birthday!

673
00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:40.831
It's your birthday?
You think it's your birthday, huh?

674
00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:43.372
Norbit's got moves, everybody! Yeah!

675
00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:45.873
You got him loose, don't you,
you little skinny bitch?

676
00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:49.139
I see what you trying to do.
I see just what you trying to do.

677
00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:53.012
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!
Come on, everybody!

678
00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:54.106
Go, Norbit!

679
00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:57.085
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

680
00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:59.122
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

681
00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:01.987
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go...

682
00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:03.150
Norbit!

683
00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:13.535
Crooked employees?
Unlicensed doctors?

684
00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:15.229
Lipstick on your husband's collar?

685
00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:17.000
Find out who you're really dealing with.

687
00:41:19.743 --> 00:41:22.075
P.O. Box 119, Locust Falls.

688
00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:23.441
Hey, buddy partner.

689
00:41:23.547 --> 00:41:27.449
Hi, Kate. Hi, nice to see you.
How you doing?

690
00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:30.614
I'm good, but how about you
and your head?

691
00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.484
Oh, I'm doing better.

692
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:37.084
The doctor said if it weren't for
my hard Afro, it could have killed me.

693
00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:45.226
Are you sure you're okay, Norbit?
That sounds kind of fast.

694
00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:49.602
Oh, well, they're doing some tests.
They're kind of monitoring me.

695
00:41:51.575 --> 00:41:54.203
Well, I don't know about this stuff,
but 110 beats per minute,

696
00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:57.280
that's kind of high. 120...

697
00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.808
Oh, my goodness, 130!

698
00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:03.353
Yeah, maybe the machine's broke.
I'm just gonna take these off.

699
00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:16.791
You Deion Hughes?

700
00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:18.266
Who's asking?

701
00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.359
We the Latimores.

702
00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:22.632
Yeah. Latimore Construction.

703
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.401
And we run this town.

704
00:42:24.508 --> 00:42:27.807
Your woman was telling us how y'all
was planning on buying the orphanage.

705
00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:29.709
Kate has her plans and I have mine.

706
00:42:29.813 --> 00:42:32.247
Well, it looks like the only plans you got,
my man, is leaving.

707
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:34.180
I ain't sticking around
raising no damn orphans.

708
00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:36.617
I got kids of my own
I ain't even bringing up.

709
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.415
So, you was just hustling her?

710
00:42:38.522 --> 00:42:41.753
Break it to her gentle for me,
would you? I'm out!

711
00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:45.893
Hold up, player.
I think you missing the flow here.

712
00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:48.865
That orphanage she buying,
that's a huge property,

713
00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:51.025
outside of town, zoned commercial.

714
00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:52.602
Even got a liquor license.

715
00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:54.136
Interesting.

716
00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:56.433
It's a perfect place for a titty bar.

717
00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.106
- Did you say "titty bar"?
- Titties.

718
00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:00.642
We got it all worked out.

719
00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:03.304
We gonna call it Nipplopolis.

720
00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:04.979
Nipplopolis.

721
00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:07.575
Shit got a ring to it, don't it?

722
00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:10.515
We talking about overpriced,
watered-down alcohol

723
00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:13.522
and fake tig old bitties in abundance.

724
00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:15.316
Ain't gonna be nothing but tax-free,

725
00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:17.417
under-the-table, pure cash money.
Big time!

726
00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:18.495
That's right.

727
00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:22.896
All you got to do is swing us the deal
and we make you partner.

728
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.262
And what about Kate?

729
00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:27.895
If you marry her,
it's as much yours as hers.

730
00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:33.436
Norbit, I really want you
to be a part of the orphanage.

731
00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.808
The kids are crazy about you.

732
00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.938
- They're good kids.
- Yeah.

733
00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:41.609
You know, I'm gonna take them
bike riding tomorrow, down by the lake.

734
00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:43.653
Why don't you come?

735
00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:46.846
I don't know if I could go for a bike ride.

736
00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:50.083
I never... I didn't really know how, the...

737
00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:53.459
I can't ride a bike still.

738
00:43:54.164 --> 00:43:56.394
You never learned? What?

739
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.525
Well, you left, you know,

740
00:43:58.636 --> 00:44:00.160
and there was nobody
there to teach me.

741
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.204
And Wong don't ride.

742
00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.766
Okay, we'll do something else.
The water park.

743
00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:07.639
The kids have been begging me
to take them there.

744
00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:09.440
Oh, I don't know about the water park.

745
00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:11.776
Come on, it's a Saturday.
You don't have to work.

746
00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:15.283
Yeah, I know, but it's the park
and it's watery,

747
00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:21.018
and there's a potential hell to pay
if I were to be there maybe...

748
00:44:21.892 --> 00:44:24.520
Hey, what are you doing
with those things, Kate?

749
00:44:24.628 --> 00:44:27.722
Well, I'm just going to have to shock you
till you say yes.

750
00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:29.696
Hey, come on, Kate.
Don't play with those.

751
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.462
- Those things are plugged in. It's hot.
- Clear.

752
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:34.935
No, no clear. No clear. Stop, Kate.
Stop, Kate.

753
00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:36.734
Come on. Yes.

754
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.105
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes! Okay, stop. Nurse!

755
00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:57.524
Oh, my God, Deion. This is beautiful.
I didn't even know you could cook.

756
00:44:57.728 --> 00:45:00.856
I just wanted to do something special
for you, you know, from the heart.

757
00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:02.898
Well, I am feeling it.

758
00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:08.895
Let's do it. Let's get married, right away.
I don't wanna wait.

759
00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:13.068
- Deion.
- Church is free on Saturday.

760
00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:16.804
You're serious?

761
00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:20.042
- Baby, we belong together.
- Yeah.

762
00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:23.384
- I want to. Saturday.
- Yeah. Yes!

763
00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:28.219
- Thank you.
- Oh, no, thank you.

764
00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:48.802
Norbit!

765
00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:51.813
Hi. Hey. Good morning, Rasputia.

766
00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:54.611
Good morning.
How are you this morning?

767
00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:56.413
Where the hell you going?

768
00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:01.653
Nowhere special.
I was just gonna go out to...

769
00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:05.195
- I was just going over to Raging Waters.
- Raging Waters?

770
00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:09.322
Yes. It's this thing
I got roped into, darling.

771
00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:12.925
You know, I was at this orphanage
when I was raised, and...

772
00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:14.162
And the people from the orphanage

773
00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:16.296
and now they're taking other orphans
to Raging Waters

774
00:46:16.406 --> 00:46:18.499
so they asked me to come
and give back to the community,

775
00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:21.134
so I'm trying to, you know, do my part.

776
00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:24.009
Little Miss Skinny Bitch gonna be there?

777
00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:26.278
You mean Miss Ling Ling?

778
00:46:26.383 --> 00:46:28.476
You know damn well
I ain't talking about no Miss Ling Ling.

779
00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:30.883
I'm talking about Miss Thing Thing
from that picnic.

780
00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:32.478
Miss Thing Thing from the picnic?

781
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:34.682
Who are you talking about, sweetheart?
I don't even...

782
00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:39.024
Wait, I think I remember now.
A girl, she had the foreign name.

783
00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:46.697
- Something Russian.
- Kate, bitch!

784
00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:49.932
Kate! Of course it's Kate. Yes,
I don't know if Kate's gonna be there.

785
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.804
I hadn't even thought about it.
It didn't even cross my mind.

786
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:56.175
I wonder, will Kate be there?
Damn good question.

787
00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.180
Well, I'm going.

788
00:46:58.282 --> 00:46:59.442
No!

789
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.984
You don't like water parks,
Rasputia. No.

790
00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.781
You don't like water parks,
Rasputia. No.

791
00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:05.878
Who don't like water parks? I love them.
They're just like amusement parks,

792
00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.116
except you ain't got to get off the ride
to go to the bathroom.

793
00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:09.522
How you doing?

794
00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:13.453
Great.

795
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.895
There you go. Have fun.

796
00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:20.936
There you go, Brian.
Nick, there's one for you.

797
00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:26.165
All right, kids, everybody please be nice
to Mrs. Latimore, okay?

798
00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:28.676
- Okay.
- Okay.

799
00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:32.880
Kate, I hope you don't mind.
I asked Rasputia to join us.

800
00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:36.146
Of course not.
I'm really glad you could come.

801
00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:40.052
Well, are we gonna stand around here
all day or we gonna go inside?

802
00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:41.317
Excuse me.

803
00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:45.024
Excuse me, ma'am.

804
00:47:45.662 --> 00:47:46.993
What?

805
00:47:48.565 --> 00:47:50.624
Are you wearing bottoms?

806
00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:53.134
Of course I'm wearing bottoms!

807
00:47:54.404 --> 00:47:56.429
Okay. Come on in.

808
00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.599
How dare you?

809
00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:06.182
Oh, hell, no.

810
00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:16.952
How you doing!

811
00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:23.492
This ain't like no real beach,

812
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.569
'cause on a real beach you got people
walking around with ice chests

813
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:30.071
and you can get all kinds of treats
like sandwiches and potato chips

814
00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:33.836
and Mentos and Skittles
and all sorts of delectables.

815
00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:35.673
You can't get shit here!

816
00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:38.805
Well, you know,
there's a concession stand.

817
00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:40.213
You going?

818
00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:42.408
No, I already ate.

819
00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:44.714
Well, you could have fooled me.

820
00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:45.879
I'm sorry?

821
00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:49.015
I'm just trying to say
you too damn skinny. Look at you.

822
00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:52.118
See, most men like a woman
that got a little... Or a little...

823
00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:53.992
You ain't got nothing.
You just skin and bones,

824
00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:56.463
just sitting in that chair
all bones and skin.

825
00:48:56.566 --> 00:48:58.124
I feel sorry for you.

826
00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:01.671
Well, I just feel that we're all made
exactly the way we're supposed to be.

827
00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.137
Oh, no. Hell, no. I'm a Christian,

828
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.698
and you ain't gonna sit there
and blame God for how you look, okay?

829
00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.641
You the one that
pushed that plate away.

830
00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:10.940
My Norbit is always telling me
there's two kinds of women,

831
00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:13.676
big old good ones
and good old big ones.

832
00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:15.273
Really?

833
00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:17.683
That's right. And, sister, let me tell you,
just between the two of us,

834
00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:18.880
I can't keep Norbit off me.

835
00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.752
He is the biggest freak
you ever wanna meet

836
00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:22.381
and he be blowing my back out,

837
00:49:22.492 --> 00:49:24.756
trying to put me
through the headboard every night.

838
00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:26.453
I'm thinking about
going on a little diet or something

839
00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:28.258
so I can get
all emaciated-looking like you,

840
00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:29.696
then he'll think I look disgusting

841
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.768
and I can get a rest
or some sleep for a little while,

842
00:49:31.868 --> 00:49:35.326
because he want it all the time.
Just boom, bam, boom, boom, boom.

843
00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:37.873
But I ain't mad at him, hey.

844
00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:39.840
I'm gonna go on a diet for sure,
next week.

845
00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:42.605
Right now I'm gonna get me
a lamb kabob and a wine cooler.

846
00:49:42.713 --> 00:49:45.978
How you doing?
Where is that wine cooler section?

847
00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:50.409
Miss Thomas, we're all going off
the Leap of Doom. Come on.

848
00:49:50.587 --> 00:49:52.953
Slowly. Slowly.
Someone's gonna fall down.

849
00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:55.684
You're gonna break your head in half
in a second. Slow down!

850
00:49:55.792 --> 00:49:57.020
Wait for me!

851
00:49:57.127 --> 00:50:01.757
I tell you, it sure is tiring chasing these
kids all around the water park, isn't it?

852
00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:04.163
Especially for us skinny folk.

853
00:50:04.267 --> 00:50:05.757
What?

854
00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:07.632
Never mind.
