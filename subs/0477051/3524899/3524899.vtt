00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.641
<i>Everyone has their path in life,</i>

2
00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.337
<i>and this is more or less</i>
<i>where mine started.</i>

3
00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:50.849
<i>My name is Norbit Albert Rice,</i>
<i>and I was an orphan.</i>

4
00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.247
<i>I like to think my parents</i>
<i>loved me very much,</i>

5
00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.986
<i>but just didn't have the means</i>
<i>to properly care for me.</i>

6
00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:04.222
<i>I can see them researching</i>
<i>all of the orphanages in the area,</i>

7
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.230
<i>agonizing over their choices,</i>

8
00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.596
<i>trying to make sure</i>
<i>their precious little boy</i>

9
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.602
<i>was raised in the perfect environment.</i>

10
00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.120
Ling Ling! Someone left another one!

11
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.882
Coyotes, go! Get! Back! Back, coyotes!

12
00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.922
Get out here! You not eat another baby.

13
00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.798
Oh, crap. Another black one.

14
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.474
Can't give these away.

15
00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:57.214
You ugly black one, too.
You be here long time.

16
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.783
Nobody ever come and say,
"Give me the ugly, black one."

17
00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:04.081
You very ugly baby.
The ugliest baby I ever seen.

18
00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:07.221
<i>A lot of people think</i>
<i>that orphanages are cold and scary,</i>

19
00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:10.057
<i>but the Golden Wonton</i>
<i>was a great place to grow up.</i>

20
00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:13.860
<i>We had everything</i>
<i>normaI children had. Pets...</i>

21
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.062
Here. Play with that.

22
00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:23.571
<i>...a big backyard,</i>
<i>and lots of kids to play with.</i>

23
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:27.276
Ling Ling!
The children got in MSG barrel.

24
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.348
Now all their hair gonna fall out again.

25
00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.680
You stupid orphan!
Nobody want a bald orphan!

26
00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:35.310
Norbit, how you find family with no hair?

27
00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.389
Nobody want a bald Norbit!

28
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.788
What the hell wrong
with the children here?

29
00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.259
<i>Mr. Wong was a very interesting man.</i>

30
00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:46.492
<i>ln addition to his love for children</i>
<i>and preparation of fine Asian cuisine,</i>

31
00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.591
<i>he had a real passion</i>
<i>for old-time whallng.</i>

32
00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.670
It's a whale, ho!

33
00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:56.739
Die, you son-of-a!

34
00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:01.438
Bingo! Right in the blow hole!

35
00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:08.550
Norbit, where you go?
Why you run off like little bitch?

36
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:13.087
<i>After Marvin Browning got lost</i>
<i>downtown for a couple of weeks,</i>

37
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.354
<i>the orphanage started using</i>
<i>a buddy system.</i>

38
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.485
Go, Norbit!

39
00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.530
<i>My buddy was little Kate.</i>

40
00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:21.998
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

41
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:27.196
That's okay. You're doing good.

42
00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:35.904
<i>Kate and I were always together.</i>
<i>Playing checkers...</i>

43
00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:38.583
-Oh, man.
-Yes!

44
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.147
<i>...watching scary movies.</i>

45
00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:48.686
<i>Why, we even pooped together.</i>

46
00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.232
<i>And then one day, Kate and I decided</i>
<i>that we should tie the knot.</i>

47
00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:57.167
<i>We got married</i>
<i>under the great big oak tree.</i>

48
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.704
I now pronounce you my wife.

49
00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:04.402
And I pronounce you my husband.

50
00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.210
It's watermelon.

51
00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.378
Yours is green apple.

52
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.221
I think it's time for us to kiss now.

53
00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:24.189
<i>And we lived happily ever after</i>

54
00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:29.498
<i>for about two weeks</i>
<i>untiI she got adopted.</i>

55
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.435
Bye, Norbit.

56
00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:39.470
<i>I didn't do too much bike riding</i>
<i>after that.</i>

57
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.948
<i>When Kate left, there was an</i>
<i>odd number of kids at the orphanage,</i>

58
00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:47.986
<i>so I was buddyless for a while.</i>

59
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:51.952
<i>And sometimes I'd get a little sad,</i>

60
00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:59.262
<i>but I never lost hope.</i>

61
00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:03.631
<i>I knew that someday I'd find</i>
<i>another somebody to share my life with.</i>

62
00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:07.035
<i>all I had to do was just be patient.</i>

63
00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:13.007
-What'd you do that for?
-Because we feIt like it.

64
00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.512
-What are you gonna do about it?
-What are you gonna do about it?

65
00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:16.582
Loser.

66
00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.380
Stop it.

67
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.793
Leave him alone.

68
00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:30.829
-Says who?
-Says who?

69
00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:37.635
-Who are you?
-Rasputia. What's your name?

70
00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:42.465
-Norbit.
-Norbit? That's a stupid name.

71
00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:46.040
-Why'd you beat those boys up?
-To protect you.

72
00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:49.945
-You got a girlfriend, Nesbit?
-Norbit.

73
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.912
No.

74
00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:55.977
Well, you do now.
Get your ass up and hold my hand.

75
00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:59.122
-Okay.
-How you doing?

76
00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:03.989
<i>Everything changed</i>
<i>once I had Rasputia as my girlfriend.</i>

77
00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.224
<i>We took care of each other,</i>

78
00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.860
<i>and the other kids</i>
<i>started to respect me.</i>

79
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.528
I'll take...

80
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.514
-Norbit.
-Come on.

81
00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:27.752
<i>And because of Rasputia,</i>
<i>for the first time in my life,</i>

82
00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:30.914
<i>I had a real family.</i>

83
00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:33.218
<i>Rasputia had three brothers.</i>

84
00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.817
<i>Big Black Jack. He was the oldest.</i>

85
00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.088
Leg.

86
00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:41.465
<i>Then, there was Blue.</i>

87
00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:43.958
Breasts.

88
00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.968
<i>And Earl. He was the baby.</i>

89
00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.336
Wing.

90
00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:52.641
<i>They sure loved their little sister,</i>

91
00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:55.043
<i>and so they treated me</i>
<i>like one of their own.</i>

92
00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:58.015
Here you go, Norbit.
Saved the best piece for you.

93
00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:02.117
-What's that?
-Turkey ass. Eat up, sucker.

94
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.017
Bon appetitty.

95
00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.283
Bon appetitty.

96
00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:10.926
<i>The Latimores had a reputation</i>

97
00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:13.964
<i>for being the meanest,</i>
<i>nastiest people in town,</i>

98
00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:16.728
<i>but that's just because</i>
<i>folks didn't know them.</i>

99
00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.498
<i>They were actually</i>
<i>very nice, hard-working people.</i>

100
00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:22.805
<i>They ran</i>
<i>the local construction company,</i>

101
00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:25.936
<i>and recently, responding to the needs</i>
<i>of the community...</i>

102
00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:27.034
Yo, Morris.

103
00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:29.944
<i>...had opened a little security business.</i>

104
00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:33.916
<i>It was a surprisingly popular service</i>
<i>among the local vendors.</i>

105
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.751
Hey, you don't shake me down.
I'm Italian. I shake you down.

106
00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:39.381
-Is that right?
-Yes.

107
00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:41.221
Get his ass in here.

108
00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:49.659
I'm in.

109
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:56.272
<i>As time passed,</i>
<i>Rasputia and I got closer and closer,</i>

110
00:07:56.809 --> 00:08:01.109
<i>in high school and as adults.</i>

111
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.918
<i>I started working as a bookkeeper</i>
<i>in her family's business.</i>

112
00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:09.587
I'm expecting
some important calIs today, Norbit,

113
00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.324
so when you answer the phone,
try and sound white.

114
00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:11.915
so when you answer the phone,
try and sound white.

115
00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:14.652
<i>It was like everything was</i>
<i>finally coming together.</i>

116
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.727
Yes.

117
00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:19.626
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>it was only naturaI that Rasputia and l</i>

118
00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:22.326
<i>would take the next step</i>
<i>in our relationship.</i>

119
00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:25.962
I now pronounce you man and wife.

120
00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.232
You may kiss the bride.

121
00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:57.095
Open your mouth.

122
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.771
Go, Rasputia!

123
00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:11.806
<i>It was a storybook wedding,</i>

124
00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:14.648
<i>the beginning of a brand-new chapter.</i>

125
00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:21.092
<i>I knew I would never be lonely again.</i>
<i>I had found my place in the world.</i>

126
00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:24.187
Poor Norbit. Man.

127
00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:27.766
Back when I was in the game,
I used to tell my hos,

128
00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:32.566
"Hos, ain't no man gonna pay for
the cow if he can get the milk for free."

129
00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:35.106
You ain't got to worry
about this brother buying the milk,

130
00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:38.005
'cause he just bought
the whole damn cow.

131
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.943
That's a speciaI cow, too.

132
00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:41.843
That must be
where buttermilk come from.

133
00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:43.506
Sing that shit, girl.

134
00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:46.481
Them are not dimples.
Them are potholes in her ass.

135
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.884
Look like an Escalade
in a wedding dress.

136
00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:55.593
It a horror show.

137
00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.994
Norbit. What a woman you got.

138
00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.032
-Hi, fellows.
-We're all jealous, right, boys?

139
00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:04.625
-Oh, yeah. Way jealous.
-Wish I had one like that.

140
00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:07.672
Norbit, let me talk to you for a second.

141
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.134
Look, just so we clear.

142
00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:16.680
lf you ever hurt my sister in any way,

143
00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:21.515
make her cry,
even make her sad one time,

144
00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:26.249
I'm coming at you
with razor blades and lemon juice.

145
00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.455
-You hear me?
-Yes.

146
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.620
I'm talking pain, boy.

147
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.893
Searing, mind-numbing pain.

148
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.467
I understand.

149
00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.763
-You understand me?
-Yes, yes, yes.

150
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.167
all right.

151
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.604
-Welcome to the family.
-Thank you.

152
00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:50.707
Somebody is take
a big hunk out of my cake!

153
00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:58.584
What y'all looking at?
I ain't had no cake.

154
00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.285
You better mind your damn business.

155
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:10.631
Hey, hey! Everyone!

156
00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:13.364
I am Mr. Wong.
I am best man in wedding.

157
00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:18.842
I feel it my place to say something,
make a toast to bride and groom,

158
00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:21.845
tell story about Norbit.
I like Norbit father.

159
00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:24.575
I raise Norbit. He like my own child.

160
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:28.085
And I want to say that
I very, very confused, Norbit,

161
00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.485
that you... You marry Latimore.

162
00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:34.389
I don't understand it, because
when you was a little boy, you say,

163
00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:39.829
"One day I find the girI of my dreams."
And then you marry a gorilla.

164
00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.559
I joke, I joke, I joke.

165
00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.603
Why you not know joke
when you hear joke?

166
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:48.265
Why you wanna make fight at wedding?

167
00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:52.743
CooI off, before I have to
bust somebody ass in here. Okay.

168
00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:55.642
When Norbit just little boy,

169
00:11:55.748 --> 00:12:01.050
he like to always
run all over place naked. Always naked.

170
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.818
And Norbit, when he was just little boy,
had a pee-pee the size of an egg roll.

171
00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:10.189
-You know, Norbit.
-That's true.

172
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:14.093
And one day, down by creek,
Norbit run around naked

173
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.102
and poisonous snake jump up
and bite Norbit right on ass.

174
00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:21.940
Very close to hole.

175
00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:27.068
Norbit pass out. I think Norbit is dead.

176
00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:31.309
I go to check the boy puIse.
He still allve. He still allve!

177
00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:35.080
"Okay," I say,
"I must do something to save child."

178
00:12:35.187 --> 00:12:37.212
So, I start to think,

179
00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:43.284
"Do I suck poison out of Norbit's ass
or do I let him die?"

180
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.858
I do the most responsible thing.

181
00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:51.959
I say, "Hell to the no!

182
00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.971
"Norbit is out of here,

183
00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:55.973
"because it is long time in hell

184
00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:59.442
"before Wong suck poison
out of another man's ass."

185
00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:06.415
But strange, mystical thing
happen, Norbit.

186
00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:09.613
Even though poison is in Norbit,
he not die.

187
00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:13.180
Norbit get stronger and stronger.

188
00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:17.695
That why I know, Norbit,
deep down inside, you very, very strong.

189
00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.890
You strong like warrior.

190
00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:23.230
That's why I say to you, Norbit,
you can survive anything.

191
00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:24.899
Even...

192
00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:30.002
So I say to everyone here, and to Norbit,

193
00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:34.739
I wish you much happiness and peace
and love,

194
00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:39.477
and lots of bananas for your new gorilla.

195
00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:42.520
I only kidding. To Norbit and Rasputia.

196
00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.086
Norbit, you know
what would be so romantic?

197
00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:50.253
lf you'd carry me over the threshold
like a little chocolate drop.

198
00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:56.396
Be delicate, now.

199
00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.937
Put your back into it.

200
00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:06.473
Come on, now. Be a man.
You ain't no man.

201
00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:08.610
Pathetic.

202
00:14:12.284 --> 00:14:16.186
Rasputia, I know we're both nervous
because we've never done this before,

203
00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:19.815
but we can take our time, darling.
ln sweet time.

204
00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:29.499
<i>Rasputia was so fulI of love.</i>

205
00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:33.502
Merry Christmas!

206
00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.404
Ho, ho, ho!

207
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:40.034
<i>It was a love that sustained us</i>
<i>through the years.</i>

208
00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:41.237
HaIt!

209
00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:46.843
187. Officer down.

210
00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:49.147
<i>And it's still going strong.</i>

211
00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:51.647
Happy Presidents' Day!

212
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.490
God bless America.

213
00:14:57.796 --> 00:15:02.631
<i>And so, we began our life together,</i>
<i>like any other happily married couple.</i>

214
00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:04.462
Morning, Rasputia.

215
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.060
"Morning, Rasputia," my ass.

216
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:08.298
I tell you what. You better do something
about that goddamn dog,

217
00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.567
because I ain't gonna be
getting terrorized

218
00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:10.972
by no dog on my own property.

219
00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:13.271
I'm sick of it! I'm gonna go out
and purchase me a pellet rifle!

220
00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:14.846
And then I'm gonna give him
something to bark about

221
00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:18.508
when I start popping pellets
in his little bug-eyed bastard's ass.

222
00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:23.076
Messing around with you,
now I'm gonna be late for dance class.

223
00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:30.353
God damn it, Norbit.

224
00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:33.454
How many times I got to tell you, when
you drive my car, don't adjust my seat!

225
00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:36.966
-I haven't touched your seat.
-Then why is it up so damn far?

226
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:40.266
It looks like it's back
as far as it goes, Rasputia.

227
00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:41.905
No, you moved it. I can tell, 'cause look,

228
00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:44.942
when I inhale,
my titty make the horn honk. Listen.

229
00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.306
You see that?

230
00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:50.145
-That ain't right.
-I hear it.

231
00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:53.343
That scientifically prove
that you was adjusting my seat.

232
00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.545
-That's not science.
-It is. Now just let it go.

233
00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:58.054
-It's not science.
-I said let it go.

234
00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:00.853
-I'm just...
-I said it was science, God damn it.

235
00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:10.357
Why you think I want to sell
Golden Wonton Restaurant?

236
00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:11.663
I got a good business.

237
00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.295
It practically run itself.
I make a lot of money here.

238
00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:20.675
Every man got a price.
We think this might be yours.

239
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:38.930
And here is my counteroffer.

240
00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:49.001
-Excuse me.

I not like rest of town people.

242
00:16:56.982 --> 00:17:00.782
-You wrong, Wong. Relax, man.
-Be cooI with that thing, Mr. Wong.

243
00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:02.581
Ling Ling, get my pistol!

244
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.748
That dude is crazy.
Let's get the hell out of here!

245
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:09.419

255
00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:43.154
I stepped in poo, better wipe it off.

256
00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:46.288

Now, pump, pump, pump, pump,

Pump, pump, pump, pump,

Excuse me, Buster?

269
00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:27.798
I think I need
a little adjustment over here.

270
00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:30.033
Look at you,
looking like the Great Pumpkin, girl.

271
00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:31.939
Trick or treat. What's going on?

272
00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:35.275
Well, see, I was born with a trick hip
and it made me real bendy.

273
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.871
See, I'm just like licorice. Look.

274
00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:41.309
Goddamn, girl,
that look like the harvest moon.

275
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.651
-Turn a brother to a werewolf.
-You just need to stop.

276
00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:48.021
You know what?
Do you do any private lessons?

277
00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:52.158
I could do private lessons
if you could do me a little favor.

278
00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:53.322
What's that?

279
00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:58.062
Just need you talk to your little brothers
about funding my little video tape.

280
00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.933
I'm trying to make power-tap
more international.

281
00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:01.596
I'm trying to be like Billy Blanks,

282
00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:03.299
but double the money
and half the Blank.

283
00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:05.103
That's a good idea.

284
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.340
Maybe I will, maybe I will.
But, first, I got to get that private lesson.

285
00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:11.541
Okay. Call me, girl.

286
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.619
-I'll call you.
-I'll be your private dancer.

287
00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.287
-Must be Saturday.
-Why is that?

288
00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:23.186
Because here come Norbit,
right on schedule.

289
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:26.190
Almost set your watch to him.

290
00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:30.661
Hey, Pope Sweet Jesus
and Lord Have Mercy.

291
00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:31.963
How you guys doing, fellows?

292
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.094
Business is good.

293
00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:35.730
Business is good.
It's almost like the good old days.

294
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:36.808
Yes, indeedy.

295
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.171
What do you mean,
"the good old days"?

296
00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:40.837
The good old days, man,
back when we was pimping, Norbit.

297
00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:41.935
You know.

298
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.342
-You guys used to pimp?
-"Used to"?

299
00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:46.747
That's a violation. still pimping.
Once a pimp, always a pimp.

300
00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:49.013
-Always. Forever.
-Boss player.

301
00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.322
Rasputia sent me down here
to get the usual.

302
00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:52.447
You guys are open, right?

303
00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:54.582
We always open.
Go on and take yourself in there, Norbit.

304
00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:55.887
We'll stack that up for you.

305
00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:00.993
-Moniqua!
-Yes, Daddy.

306
00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:04.557
Can you get King Kong
three large buckets, extra sauce?

307
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.160
-Please don't trim the fat.
-Yes, Daddy.

308
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:08.466
Please don't trim that fat.
She wilI kilI me.

309
00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:10.098
Norbit, while I got your attention,

310
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:13.440
can I interest you in some new shoes,
maybe a haircut?

311
00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:15.513
How about a bath or a sink?

312
00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:18.276
Hey, don't tell me
you guys bought the bath store, too?

313
00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.715
It's a perfect fit, man.
We used to sell bitches to johns.

314
00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:23.287
Now we selling johns to bitches.

315
00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:26.585
-Beds, bitches, and beyond!
-Sound like money to me.

316
00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:27.716
No, thanks, guys.

317
00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:30.021
I got to go do a puppet show
for the kids at the orphanage.

318
00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:31.095
At the orphanage?

319
00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:33.460
That's a nice thing you do
for them little kids over there.

320
00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:35.089
Why don't you take
these little tater puffs

321
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.462

322
00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:39.332
Oh, that's great, guys. That's sweet.

323
00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:42.100
Wait, my puppets! I forgot my puppets!

-Where's his puppets?
-He ain't got no puppets.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.380

Okay, you in trouble, now.
You in trouble. You in trouble, now.

333
00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:22.107
Take it with your big old self, girl.
You ain't never had it like this.

334
00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:24.444
You ain't never had it like this!

335
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:26.278
Hell, yeah.
Come on, we gonna do pig in a blanket.

336
00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:27.750
Come on, pig in a blanket.

337
00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:30.481
-Now squeal. Squeal! Squeal!
-Oink, oink, oink!

338
00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:31.647
Take it from the back.

339
00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:35.488
Damn, I feel like Willy Wonka,
all this sweet chocolate up in this...

340
00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:42.056
Hey. How you doing, man?
What's good with you, brother?

341
00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:44.294
How's it going, man? How you doing?

342
00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:46.428
I'm Bust-a-move Perkin.
How you doing?

343
00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:48.130
Man, your wife was
just talking about you.

344
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.935
Man, she love you.

345
00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:55.207
-You're Rasputia's tap dance teacher.
-Man, actually, I'm her power-tap guru.

346
00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.942
I was just here
giving her a little tap lesson.

347
00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.745
But you're naked.

348
00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:02.384
That's just so she could see
the various muscle groups

349
00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:03.818
as I go through the various routines.

350
00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:07.517
You see that there?
You can't see that with a turtleneck.

351
00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:10.651
And you have an...

352
00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:13.822
Oh, man,
I'm just real passionate about dance.

353
00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:16.594
You can say the word "dance"
and he just jump up. Dance!

354
00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:18.431
See that? See that there?

355
00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:19.796
'Sputia?

356
00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:21.896
Norbit, Buster's a guest in our home.

357
00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.668
How dare you insinuate
something like that?

358
00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:25.333
Yeah, Orbit!

359
00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:28.709
How dare you insinuate
something such like that!

360
00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:33.547
You know, I am actually offended
by your accusization, you understand?

361
00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:37.019
And rather than sit here and have
a belligerent confrontation with you,

362
00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:39.590
'cause I am a God-fearing man,

363
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:44.060
I'm'a do like Jesus H. Christ
would do in a situation such as such

364
00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:46.960
and I'm gonna turn the other cheek.

365
00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:48.362
Amen.

366
00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:54.995
You happy now?

367
00:22:55.107 --> 00:22:57.075
Rasputia, you cheated on me!

368
00:22:57.175 --> 00:22:58.802
Look, I told your ass
ain't nothing happened,

369
00:22:58.910 --> 00:22:59.968
and the next time you say
it happened again,

370
00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:02.512
I'm gonna knock your teeth
out your mouth.

371
00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:05.675
Rasputia, we took vows.
I'm your husband.

372
00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:10.182
Rasputia, we took vows,
and you cheated on me!

373
00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:12.387
It never happened!

374
00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:15.551
Yes, it did!

375
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.721
And that makes you
the queen of whores!

376
00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:26.670
Hey, Norbit!

377
00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:35.737
Run for your lives!

378
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.112
Bastard! Come here!

379
00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:45.019
Oh, sweet Moses! Oh, my God!

380
00:23:45.123 --> 00:23:47.489
Come here! Come here!
Come here to me!

381
00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:48.752
No! Leave me alone!

382
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.487
You ain't nothing
but a goddamn coward!

383
00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:51.960
Saddle tramp!

384
00:23:57.803 --> 00:24:00.067
That's what your stupid black ass get!

385
00:24:00.172 --> 00:24:02.265
I hope you broke your ass!

386
00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:05.533
Since you feel like running, Norbit,

387
00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:08.477
why don't you run your ass
down to the Rib Shak

388
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.982
and get me a short stack of ribs?

389
00:24:10.982 --> 00:24:11.812
and get me a short stack of ribs?

390
00:24:11.917 --> 00:24:14.477
Extra hot sauce.

391
00:24:14.586 --> 00:24:17.987
all this setting you straight
done got me famished.

392
00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:27.990
I'm Little Red Riding Goose,

393
00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:30.727
walking through the forest,
minding my own business,

394
00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:32.701
when all at once...

395
00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:33.930
Hello.

396
00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:37.702
-Who are you?
-I'm the big, bad pig of the forest.

397
00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:40.573
My, what big eyes you have, Pig.

398
00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:42.670
The better to see you with, Goose.

399
00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:46.046
And my, what a big nose you have, Pig.

400
00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:49.780
The better to smelI them scrumptious
goodies you got in your basket.

401
00:24:49.888 --> 00:24:52.516
Hey, let me take a look in there.

402
00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:56.788
Oh, no, you don't.
You're gonna try to steaI my food.

403
00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.328
No, I won't steaI your food.

404
00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.228
Don't let that pig
push you around, Goose.

405
00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:04.461
Yeah, I'm tired of
you pushing me around.

406
00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:06.628
Look, I'm tired of
playing with your ass, bitch.

407
00:25:06.738 --> 00:25:08.330
I know you got ribs in that basket.

408
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.805
You better give them up smooth

409
00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:12.342
or I'm gonna break my hoof off
in your goose ass.

410
00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:15.208
Oh, really? Well, why don't you get up
off of your lazy behind

411
00:25:15.313 --> 00:25:17.440
and go down to the Rib Shak
and get your own ribs?

412
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:20.177
Or better still,
why don't you just call Buster

413
00:25:20.285 --> 00:25:22.378
and tell him to come over
and power-tap you,

414
00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:24.614
because in addition to being
the pig of the forest,

415
00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:27.521
you're aIso a saddle tramp,
whore, bitch pig...

416
00:25:27.626 --> 00:25:31.756
Norbit! What you doing?
This supposed to be a children's show.

417
00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:35.890
This remind me
of Chinese snuff film I once co-star in.

418
00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:39.437
I'm sorry. I got a little carried away.

419
00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:42.607
Wow, Norbit,
that was some puppet show.

420
00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:48.176
Oh, come on. You don't remember me?

421
00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:53.408
-Kate. Kate.
-Come here!

422
00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:56.976
Kate! Kate! Oh, God!
I can't believe it! Kate!

423
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:59.348
Well, can I have a hug?

424
00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:03.717
Norbit.

425
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.491
It just like old times.

426
00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:10.295
Maybe you two go take poop together.

427
00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:19.103
This place has not changed at all.

428
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.976
Oh, yeah. Some of this furniture's
even come back in style.

429
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:25.345
So, how long are
you gonna be visiting for?

430
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.680
No, I'm not visiting. I'm moving back.

431
00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:30.619
Really? Wow.

432
00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:33.418
I sold my clothing business in Atlanta,

433
00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:36.722
and I'm going to use the money
to buy the orphanage.

434
00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.261
What?

435
00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:43.334
Mr. Wong's getting older.
He wants to go whallng, so...

436
00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:47.829
You know, it's always been my dream
to come back here and take over.

437
00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:49.937
That's great.

438
00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:53.110
Norbit, look.

439
00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:57.676
That's the tree we got married under.

440
00:26:59.918 --> 00:27:02.443
You know, I've still got my ring.

441
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.218
I ate mine.

442
00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:09.485
I missed you so much when you left.

443
00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.592
I missed you, too.

444
00:27:15.066 --> 00:27:16.658
That's my car.

445
00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:20.967
We didn't really get a chance
to catch up much.

446
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.508
I'll be back in town on Tuesday.
You wanna have lunch?

447
00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:28.638
Yeah, I would love to
have lunch on Tuesday.

448
00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:29.975
-I love lunch.
-Okay.

449
00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:33.812
Lunch, yes. For sure.
I love lunch. Tuesday.

450
00:27:34.285 --> 00:27:35.343
I'll see you Tuesday.

451
00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:39.048
I'll see you on Tuesday.
We'll have lunch on Tuesday.

452
00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:41.549
Tuesday.

453
00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:44.689
Tuesday. Tuesday.

454
00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:48.459
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday.

455
00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:52.499
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday...

456
00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:56.404
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday, Tuesday...

457
00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:04.238
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

458
00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:07.512
<i>Tuesday, Tuesday...</i>

459
00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:11.555
Say "Tuesday" again
and you ain't gonna see Wednesday!

460
00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:13.783
I got it. I'll get it. Tuesday.

461
00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:17.223
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

462
00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:19.960
-Buster. How you doing? You look great.
-Hey.

463
00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:22.226
-Oh, thank you, man.
-Good to see you. Good to see you.

464
00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:24.324
Thank you.
I thought you were gonna be at work.

465
00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:25.698
Yeah, I'm on my way out now.

466
00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:27.965
But hey, look,
there's cold beer in the refrigerator

467
00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:30.200
and there's fresh sheets on the bed.
Go have a great dance lesson.

468
00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:31.468
-all right.
-all right.

469
00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:32.804
Power-tap.

470
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:35.709
Very good, very good.

471
00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:39.183
Tuesday.

472
00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:44.878
What's wrong with your boy?
He real cooI all of a sudden.

473
00:28:44.989 --> 00:28:48.823
Yeah, I don't know what the hell got
into him, but I know I got dance fever.

474
00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:51.395
Ready for a little power-tap, huh?

475
00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:54.628
Lord, give me strength.

476
00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:56.958
Hey, Sam, happy Tuesday.

477
00:28:57.068 --> 00:28:58.228
Norbit.

478
00:28:58.336 --> 00:28:59.462
Norbit.

479
00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:02.438
-Hey, Kate. Hi.
-Come on, I got us a table.

480
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.235
Great. I've been looking forward to this
all week.

481
00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:05.809
Good.

482
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.537
Hey.

483
00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:09.237
Hey. Who's he?

484
00:29:09.347 --> 00:29:11.406
Norbit, this is my fiancé, Deion Hughes.

485
00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:14.508
How you doing, my man?
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

486
00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:16.746
-This is your fiancé?
-Yes, sir.

487
00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:19.688
I was just telling Deion that you and l
were buddy partners at the orphanage.

488
00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.725
Now she and I are buddy partners.

489
00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:25.762
Shame on you, man,
letting a girI go like this. I feel for you.

490
00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:28.332
And so Deion's got all this experience
in real estate,

491
00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:31.368
so he's going to help me buy
the orphanage, Norbit. It's so exciting!

492
00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:33.198
No, wait, wait. No, no.
Slow down, slow down.

493
00:29:33.304 --> 00:29:35.966
I mean, you know,
we're just out here just scouting it out.

494
00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:38.133
all right? This is her nest egg,
you know.

495
00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:39.904
I don't want her
making any hasty decisions

496
00:29:40.011 --> 00:29:41.808
that she might regret later, you know?

497
00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:44.438
She worked too hard for this money,
man, you know what I mean?

498
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:47.074
Deion, you take
such good care of me, baby.

499
00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:49.847
It's my job. Stop it.

500
00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:51.987
Okay?

501
00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:59.286
Don't you just love Tuesdays?

502
00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:08.362
Lloyd, just tell me why it has to hurt
so GD much.

503
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:14.401
What's the matter, boy?

504
00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:18.573
You sensing an earthquake
or some other sort of naturaI disaster?

505
00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:25.886
That's just my...

506
00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:27.821
My wife.

507
00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:40.230
A man needs his own space.

508
00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:53.611
Finally! For the love of Cain.

509
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:01.058
Moses!

510
00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:05.328
I'll see you suckers
tomorrow at the picnic!

511
00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:22.479
Damn it, Norbit!
How many times I got to tell you,

512
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.911
don't be messing with my car seat!

513
00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:25.880
Nobody touched your old, stupid seat.

514
00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:29.351
Then how come
it's all mushed up like this, then?

515
00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:31.422
Well, you know, Rasputia,
you've been eating so much lately

516
00:31:31.522 --> 00:31:36.118
there's a very strong possibility that...
The car is shrinking.

517
00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:39.219
Might be shrinking.
The car is being smaller.

518
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:44.029
Yeah, you might be right. Been raining
a lot lately. all this moist weather.

519
00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:47.662
-Oh, yeah? That'll make it shrink.
-This weather's so moist.

520
00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:55.706
How you doing?

521
00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:03.485
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was hot like me</i>

522
00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:06.386
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was a freak like me</i>

523
00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.188
<i>Don't cha</i>

524
00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:12.329
Look at that dog over there,
eyeballing me.

525
00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:15.126
Rasputia, what are you doing?

526
00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:16.495
Shut up!

527
00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:20.799
-Hey, slow down! You're gonna hit him!
-I got you now. I got you now!

528
00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:25.800
-Stop it! No!
-I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

529
00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:29.073
Rasputia, don't! No! No! No!

530
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.955
I know what that sound means!

531
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:37.387
I know what that sound means!

532
00:32:37.488 --> 00:32:39.718
Bark! How you doing!

533
00:32:39.824 --> 00:32:41.018
Lloyd!

534
00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:44.220
Enough is enough.

535
00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:47.355
Now, where in the hell
do you think you're going?

536
00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:49.326
Lloyd's in the hospitaI because of you!

537
00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:51.459
Yeah, that's right.
I put his little dog ass in the hospital.

538
00:32:51.569 --> 00:32:54.163
And I'd have put it in the morgue, too,
if you didn't mess with my car seat.

539
00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:55.671
It threw off my driving skilIs.

540
00:32:55.773 --> 00:33:02.303
Rasputia, you are a mean, selfish, cold,
heartless woman, and I am leaving you!

541
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.505
-You leaving me?
-Yes!

542
00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:07.012
Well, where the hell
you think you're going, big shot?

543
00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:08.847
You ain't got no money.
You ain't got no family.

544
00:33:08.953 --> 00:33:10.545
Everything is in my name, the car,
the house...

545
00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:13.146
You ain't nothing and you ain't gonna
never be nothing without me, Norbit!

546
00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:17.193
Norbit, you just can't leave!
Norbit, please, I'm with child!

547
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.257
With child?

548
00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:25.803
Oh, yes, Norbit, can't you tell?
I'm getting a little belly.

549
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:29.897
And my titties is all achy and itchy-like.

550
00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:33.340
Oh, Norbit, we gonna be a family.

551
00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:40.178
Oh, Norbit, come hug me,
Daddy, please.

552
00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:44.919
Please, Norbit.

553
00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:05.867
I understand, little pony.

554
00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:08.669
I know your pain.

555
00:34:10.014 --> 00:34:11.914
Oh, yes, I know.

556
00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:16.076
Excuse me, snow bunny.

557
00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:19.588
I don't come in your jurisdiction,
throwing town picnics.

558
00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:23.626
Yet here you is all up in mines,
pimping hos.

559
00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:25.360
It's just a kissing booth.

560
00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:29.194
Call it what you will,
but Pope Sweet Jesus

561
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.961
is taking half.

562
00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:34.564
You work for me now, ho.

563
00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:36.929
Sure.

564
00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:38.440
Let me taste the goods.

565
00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:39.976
Put it on me.

566
00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:42.974
-Greasy.
-Greasy.

567
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:44.912
We back in business.

568
00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:50.345
I wanna be a ho. How do I apply?

569
00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:54.684
Please, Lord Jesus, help me!
Look, look, tickets! Hey, tickets, tickets.

570
00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:56.384
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Line up with your buddy.

571
00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:57.654
Line up with your buddy.

572
00:34:57.762 --> 00:34:59.195
-You got one, sweetie.
-Can we go on the jumper?

573
00:34:59.297 --> 00:35:00.286
Yeah, yeah, you go.

574
00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:03.367
Baby, you know I love you.
I love these kids.

575
00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:05.493
It's just that
I don't think buying an orphanage

576
00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:08.697
is the right move financially right now.
That's all.

577
00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:10.865
Hey, this is not
a financiaI decision, Deion.

578
00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:13.341
-I thought you understood that, baby.
-No. No, I do. I do, baby.

579
00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:16.174
But this the call I was telling you...
The business call, it's very important.

580
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.145
Let's talk about it
when I get back to the house, okay?

581
00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:19.477
You're not going to stay?

582
00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:21.916
No, very important. Here.

583
00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:27.052
Hello? It's never a bad time for you.

584
00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:30.683
Stop it! Stop!

585
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.092
Norbit!

586
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.293
-Hey.
-Hi.

587
00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:37.000
Hey.

588
00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:39.797
-I didn't know you were gonna be here.
-Oh, yeah.

589
00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:42.236
Hey, you know, I just saw Deion leaving.

590
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.641
He had some business to take care of.

591
00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:48.771
So, who are you here with?

592
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.038
My wife.

593
00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:58.082
-Norbit, I didn't know you were married.
-Yeah.

594
00:35:58.189 --> 00:36:02.216
-Well, that's wonderful. Really.
-Thank you so much.

595
00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:03.987
So, where is she?

596
00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:08.163
Right over there in the print outfit.

597
00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:11.201
The one talking to the girI by the bench?

598
00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:15.033
No, the one sucking the jelly
out of them donuts.

599
00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:21.811
Oh, yeah. She's pretty.

600
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.944
That's cherry.
Is that cherry or strawberry?

601
00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:27.574
What are my kids doing? Peter! Theo!

602
00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:30.051
I don't want you bothering anyone.

603
00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:32.890
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Rice.

604
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.185
Mrs. Rice?
My name ain't no damn Mrs. Rice.

605
00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:37.693
Oh, I just thought
'cause you're married to Norbit...

606
00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:38.921
Who the hell are you?

607
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.090
Kate, this is my wife,
Rasputia Latimore,

608
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.599
and, Rasputia, this is Kate.

609
00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:46.398
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

610
00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:48.734
Kate's an old friend of mine
from the orphanage.

611
00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:51.569
Latimore, as in Latimore Construction?

612
00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:53.507
Yes, that's right,
as in Latimore Construction.

613
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:54.873
That's right. Why?

614
00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:56.344
Well, just that this is perfect,

615
00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:59.939
'cause I was going to come see
you guys about a renovation of...

616
00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:01.651
I ain't come out here for that.

617
00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:04.084
I'm out here to enjoy these festivities,
not to be talking no business.

618
00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:05.678
You wanna talk business,
my brother is Big Black Jack

619
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:06.757
over there by the BB guns.

620
00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:08.586
Go over there and talk to him.
I ain't got no time for this.

621
00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:10.456
Oh, sure, okay.

622
00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:12.290
Well, go on, get.

623
00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:15.126
-Okay.
-Okay.

624
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.166
-Come here.
-What, Rasputia?

625
00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:24.741
You thinking about creeping, ain't you?

626
00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:25.934
We're just friends.

627
00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:28.739
What'd I tell you about having friends?

628
00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:30.370
Go over there
and get me another wine cooler.

629
00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:32.745
It's hot as hell out here.
Don't you see I'm sweItering?

630
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:36.445
-Rasputia, you can't drink wine.
-Why the hell not?

631
00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:41.224
-You're with child.
-With child? I ain't with no...

632
00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:46.328
Oh, that was... I had gas. I still got it.

633
00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:51.557
There's your child.
Now, go get me something to drink.

634
00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:01.308
Twins!

635
00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:03.673
Hey! You come back here!

636
00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.811
-Oh, my God!
-Move your fat ass, boy.

637
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.150
Look, you got one!

638
00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.692
Get him. Get him, Big Black.

639
00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:19.829
Are you Big Black Jack?

640
00:38:20.197 --> 00:38:21.824
What it look like?

641
00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:24.298
Oh, well.

642
00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:27.530
Me and my fiancé
are buying the Golden Wonton...

643
00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:30.971
Wong's place? He's selling it to you?

644
00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:33.600
Yeah. Why is that surprising?

645
00:38:33.711 --> 00:38:35.872
Miss Thomas, Miss Thomas, let's go.
They're starting the music.

646
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.447
-Oh, great!
-Come on. Let's go.

647
00:38:37.548 --> 00:38:40.039
Can we finish this up later?
Apparently I have to go dance now.

648
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.642
all right, baby. You go dance now.

649
00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:46.287
The orphanage is in play.

650
00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:52.121
Y'all better give me my hat.
Give me the hat!

651
00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:53.662
Here, take her hat.

652
00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:57.493
You think I won't come up in here?
I'm gonna come up in here.

653
00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:07.733
You think I'm playing?

654
00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:09.574
Give me the hat right now,
or I'm gonna tear your leg off.

655
00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:12.409
Hey, Norbit, come on!

656
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.485
Oh, no. No, I can't.
Rasputia's waiting for me.

657
00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:17.918
-Come on, dance with us.
-No, really, I shouldn't...

658
00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:21.617
Don't think I won't kilI a child.
I'll kilI a child in front of everybody.

659
00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.626
Little street urchins.

660
00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:29.087
Okay. That's it.
Now it's time to bring the pain.

661
00:39:36.173 --> 00:39:38.664
Dance, Norbit, dance! Come on!

662
00:39:43.447 --> 00:39:44.573
My hat!

663
00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.878
It's raining little white women.

664
00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:52.888
My prayers have been answered!

665
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.050
She'd better move,
'cause my prayer is for a Cadillac.

666
00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.534
You little bastards.

667
00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:14.540
Where the hell is Norbit
with that wine cooler?

668
00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:16.442
I'm thirsty as hell.

669
00:40:25.956 --> 00:40:27.446
Oh, hell, no.

670
00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.119
Oh, he's lost his mind.

671
00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:35.221
Bitch, that's my wine cooler!

672
00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:38.529
It's my birthday! It's my birthday!

673
00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:40.831
It's your birthday?
You think it's your birthday, huh?

674
00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:43.372
Norbit's got moves, everybody! Yeah!

675
00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:45.873
You got him loose, don't you,
you little skinny bitch?

676
00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:49.139
I see what you trying to do.
I see just what you trying to do.

677
00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:53.012
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!
Come on, everybody!

678
00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:54.106
Go, Norbit!

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:57.085
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

680
00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:59.122
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go...

688
00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:23.441
Hey, buddy partner.

689
00:41:23.547 --> 00:41:27.449
Hi, Kate. Hi, nice to see you.
How you doing?

690
00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:30.614
I'm good, but how about you
and your head?

691
00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.484
Oh, I'm doing better.

692
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:37.084
The doctor said if it weren't for
my hard Afro, it could have killed me.

693
00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:45.226
Are you sure you're okay, Norbit?
That sounds kind of fast.

694
00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:49.602
Oh, well, they're doing some tests.
They're kind of monitoring me.

695
00:41:51.575 --> 00:41:54.203
Well, I don't know about this stuff,
but 1 10 beats per minute,

696
00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:57.280
that's kind of high. 120...

697
00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.808
Oh, my goodness, 130!

698
00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:03.353
Yeah, maybe the machine's broke.
I'm just gonna take these off.

699
00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:16.791
You Deion Hughes?

700
00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:18.266
Who's asking?

701
00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.359
We the Latimores.

702
00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:22.632
Yeah. Latimore Construction.

703
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.401
And we run this town.

704
00:42:24.508 --> 00:42:27.807
Your woman was telling us how y'all
was planning on buying the orphanage.

705
00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:29.709
Kate has her plans and I have mine.

706
00:42:29.813 --> 00:42:32.247
Well, it looks like the only plans you got,
my man, is leaving.

707
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:34.180
I ain't sticking around
raising no damn orphans.

708
00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:36.617
I got kids of my own
I ain't even bringing up.

709
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.415
So, you was just hustling her?

710
00:42:38.522 --> 00:42:41.753
Break it to her gentle for me,
would you? I'm out!

711
00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:45.893
Hold up, player.
I think you missing the flow here.

712
00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:48.865
That orphanage she buying,
that's a huge property,

713
00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:51.025
outside of town, zoned commercial.

714
00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:52.602
Even got a liquor license.

715
00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:54.136
lnteresting.

716
00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:56.433
It's a perfect place for a titty bar.

717
00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.106
-Did you say "titty bar"?
-Titties.

718
00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:00.642
We got it all worked out.

719
00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:03.304
We gonna call it Nipplopolis.

720
00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:04.979
Nipplopolis.

721
00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:07.575
Shit got a ring to it, don't it?

722
00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:10.515
We talking about overpriced,
watered-down alcohol

723
00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:13.522
and fake tig old bitties in abundance.

724
00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:15.316
Ain't gonna be nothing but tax-free,

725
00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:17.417
under-the-table, pure cash money.
Big time!

726
00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:18.495
That's right.

727
00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:22.896
all you got to do is swing us the deal
and we make you partner.

728
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.262
And what about Kate?

729
00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:27.895
lf you marry her,
it's as much yours as hers.

730
00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:33.436
Norbit, I really want you
to be a part of the orphanage.

731
00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.808
The kids are crazy about you.

732
00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.938
-They're good kids.
-Yeah.

733
00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:41.609
You know, I'm gonna take them
bike riding tomorrow, down by the lake.

734
00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:43.653
Why don't you come?

735
00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:46.846
I don't know if I could go for a bike ride.

736
00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:50.083
I never... I didn't really know how, the...

737
00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:53.459
I can't ride a bike still.

738
00:43:54.164 --> 00:43:56.394
You never learned? What?

739
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.525
Well, you left, you know,

740
00:43:58.636 --> 00:44:00.160
and there was nobody
there to teach me.

741
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.204
And Wong don't ride.

742
00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.766
Okay, we'll do something eIse.
The water park.

743
00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:07.639
The kids have been begging me
to take them there.

744
00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:09.440
Oh, I don't know about the water park.

745
00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:11.776
Come on, it's a Saturday.
You don't have to work.

746
00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:15.283
Yeah, I know, but it's the park
and it's watery,

747
00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:21.018
and there's a potentiaI hell to pay
if I were to be there maybe...

748
00:44:21.892 --> 00:44:24.520
Hey, what are you doing
with those things, Kate?

749
00:44:24.628 --> 00:44:27.722
Well, I'm just going to have to shock you
tilI you say yes.

750
00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:29.696
Hey, come on, Kate.
Don't play with those.

751
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.462
-Those things are plugged in. It's hot.
-Clear.

752
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:34.935
No, no clear. No clear. Stop, Kate.
Stop, Kate.

753
00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:36.734
Come on. Yes.

754
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.105
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Yes, yes, yes, yes! Okay, stop. Nurse!

755
00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:57.524
Oh, my God, Deion. This is beautiful.
I didn't even know you could cook.

756
00:44:57.728 --> 00:45:00.856
I just wanted to do something special
for you, you know, from the heart.

757
00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:02.898
Well, I am feeling it.

758
00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:08.895
Let's do it. Let's get married, right away.
I don't wanna wait.

759
00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:13.068
-Deion.
-Church is free on Saturday.

760
00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:16.804
You're serious?

761
00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:20.042
-Baby, we belong together.
-Yeah.

762
00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:23.384
-I want to. Saturday.
-Yeah. Yes!

763
00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:28.219
-Thank you.
-Oh, no, thank you.

764
00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:48.802
Norbit!

765
00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:51.813
Hi. Hey. Good morning, Rasputia.

766
00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:54.611
Good morning.
How are you this morning?

767
00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:56.413
Where the hell you going?

768
00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:01.653
Nowhere special.
I was just gonna go out to...

769
00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:05.195
-I was just going over to Raging Waters.
-Raging Waters?

770
00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:09.322
Yes. It's this thing
I got roped into, darling.

771
00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:12.925
You know, I was at this orphanage
when I was raised, and...

772
00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:14.162
And the people from the orphanage

773
00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:16.296
and now they're taking other orphans
to Raging Waters

774
00:46:16.406 --> 00:46:18.499
so they asked me to come
and give back to the community,

775
00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:21.134
so I'm trying to, you know, do my part.

776
00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:24.009
Little Miss Skinny Bitch gonna be there?

777
00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:26.278
You mean Miss Ling Ling?

778
00:46:26.383 --> 00:46:28.476
You know damn well
I ain't talking about no Miss Ling Ling.

779
00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:30.883
I'm talking about Miss Thing Thing
from that picnic.

780
00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:32.478
Miss Thing Thing from the picnic?

781
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:34.682
Who are you talking about, sweetheart?
I don't even...

782
00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:39.024
Wait, I think I remember now.
A girl, she had the foreign name.

783
00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:46.697
-Something Russian.
-Kate, bitch!

784
00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:49.932
Kate! Of course it's Kate. Yes,
I don't know if Kate's gonna be there.

785
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.804
I hadn't even thought about it.
It didn't even cross my mind.

786
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:56.175
I wonder, wilI Kate be there?
Damn good question.

787
00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.180
Well, I'm going.

788
00:46:58.282 --> 00:46:59.442
No!

789
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.984
You don't like water parks,
Rasputia. No.

790
00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.781
You don't like water parks,
Rasputia. No.

791
00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:05.878
Who don't like water parks? I love them.
They're just like amusement parks,

792
00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.116
except you ain't got to get off the ride
to go to the bathroom.

793
00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:09.522
How you doing?

794
00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:13.453
Great.

795
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.895
There you go. Have fun.

796
00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:20.936
There you go, Brian.
Nick, there's one for you.

797
00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:26.165
all right, kids, everybody please be nice
to Mrs. Latimore, okay?

798
00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:28.676
-Okay.
-Okay.

799
00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:32.880
Kate, I hope you don't mind.
I asked Rasputia to join us.

800
00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:36.146
Of course not.
I'm really glad you could come.

801
00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:40.052
Well, are we gonna stand around here
all day or we gonna go inside?

802
00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:41.317
Excuse me.

803
00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:45.024
Excuse me, ma'am.

804
00:47:45.662 --> 00:47:46.993
What?

805
00:47:48.565 --> 00:47:50.624
Are you wearing bottoms?

806
00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:53.134
Of course I'm wearing bottoms!

807
00:47:54.404 --> 00:47:56.429
Okay. Come on in.

808
00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.599
How dare you?

809
00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:06.182
Oh, hell, no.

810
00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:16.952
How you doing!

811
00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:23.492
This ain't like no real beach,

812
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.569
'cause on a real beach you got people
walking around with ice chests

813
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:30.071
and you can get all kinds of treats
like sandwiches and potato chips

814
00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:33.836
and Mentos and Skittles
and all sorts of delectables.

815
00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:35.673
You can't get shit here!

816
00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:38.805
Well, you know,
there's a concession stand.

817
00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:40.213
You going?

818
00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:42.408
No, I already ate.

819
00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:44.714
Well, you could have fooled me.

820
00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:45.879
I'm sorry?

821
00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:49.015
I'm just trying to say
you too damn skinny. Look at you.

822
00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:52.118
See, most men like a woman
that got a little... Or a little...

823
00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:53.992
You ain't got nothing.
You just skin and bones,

824
00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:56.463
just sitting in that chair
all bones and skin.

825
00:48:56.566 --> 00:48:58.124
I feel sorry for you.

826
00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:01.671
Well, I just feel that we're all made
exactly the way we're supposed to be.

827
00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.137
Oh, no. Hell, no. I'm a Christian,

828
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.698
and you ain't gonna sit there
and blame God for how you look, okay?

829
00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.641
You the one that
pushed that plate away.

830
00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:10.940
My Norbit is always telling me
there's two kinds of women,

831
00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:13.676
big old good ones
and good old big ones.

832
00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:15.273
Really?

833
00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:17.683
That's right. And, sister, let me tell you,
just between the two of us,

834
00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:18.880
I can't keep Norbit off me.

835
00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.752
He is the biggest freak
you ever wanna meet

836
00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:22.381
and he be blowing my back out,

837
00:49:22.492 --> 00:49:24.756
trying to put me
through the headboard every night.

838
00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:26.453
I'm thinking about
going on a little diet or something

839
00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:28.258
so I can get
all emaciated-looking like you,

840
00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:29.696
then he'll think I look disgusting

841
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.768
and I can get a rest
or some sleep for a little while,

842
00:49:31.868 --> 00:49:35.326
because he want it all the time.
Just boom, bam, boom, boom, boom.

843
00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:37.873
But I ain't mad at him, hey.

844
00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:39.840
I'm gonna go on a diet for sure,
next week.

845
00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:42.605
Right now I'm gonna get me
a lamb kabob and a wine cooler.

846
00:49:42.713 --> 00:49:45.978
How you doing?
Where is that wine cooler section?

847
00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:50.409
Miss Thomas, we're all going off
the Leap of Doom. Come on.

848
00:49:50.587 --> 00:49:52.953
Slowly. Slowly.
Someone's gonna fall down.

849
00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:55.684
You're gonna break your head in half
in a second. Slow down!

850
00:49:55.792 --> 00:49:57.020
Wait for me!

851
00:49:57.127 --> 00:50:01.757
I tell you, it sure is tiring chasing these
kids all around the water park, isn't it?

852
00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:04.163
Especially for us skinny folk.

853
00:50:04.267 --> 00:50:05.757
What?

854
00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:07.632
Never mind.

855
00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:12.469
So, Norbit, I have some news.

856
00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:16.105
Deion and l
decided to move up the wedding.

857
00:50:16.713 --> 00:50:17.873
What wedding?

858
00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:19.608
Our wedding.

859
00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:22.680
We're going to get married on Saturday.

860
00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:25.912
You're getting married on Saturday?

861
00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:29.390
Yeah, we just figured, "Why wait?"
You know?

862
00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:37.763
Well... Congratulations, then.

863
00:50:38.468 --> 00:50:39.492
Thanks.

864
00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:41.195
-Yeah.
-I'm really happy.

865
00:50:41.304 --> 00:50:43.670
Oh, so am l. It's wonderful.

866
00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:48.171
So, there it is, the Leap of Doom.

867
00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:50.473
Yeah, go and have fun.
I'll wait for you at the bottom.

868
00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.547
You go have some fun.

869
00:50:51.648 --> 00:50:53.309
-Okay.
-Okay.

870
00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:59.185
Okay, kids, one at a time.

871
00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:04.724
I guess this is me.

872
00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:10.530
What are you looking at, Norbit?

873
00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:16.328
I was just watching the... Some kids.
They're about to come down the slide.

874
00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.772
I wanted to watch
the kids come down safely.

875
00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:20.634
-Kids, huh?
-Yeah.

876
00:51:20.977 --> 00:51:23.537
So, you wanna watch a bitch
come down a slide?

877
00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:26.081
Well, I'm gonna show you
how a bitch come down a slide.

878
00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:27.741
Oh, no...

879
00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:38.223
Excuse me, ma'am?
We have a 300-pound weight limit.

880
00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:46.796
I don't weigh no damn 300 pounds.
I weigh 165. How you doing?

881
00:51:48.738 --> 00:51:50.603
That was awesome.

882
00:51:55.545 --> 00:51:57.137
What's that?

883
00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.108
It's Rasputia.

884
00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:06.018
I'm gonna show you
how a bitch go down a slide.

885
00:52:20.203 --> 00:52:22.103
I'm sliding, bitches!

886
00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:28.939
Mary, Mother of God.

887
00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:31.276
Slow down! Stop! Stop!

888
00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:50.356
How you doing?

889
00:52:57.641 --> 00:52:59.700
Why does she have to go
and get married, Lloyd?

890
00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:01.800
Things were going so well.

891
00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:06.482
There it is.

892
00:53:07.884 --> 00:53:11.183
Hey. Sorry about the concussion.

893
00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:13.553
-It's okay.
-And the whiplash.

894
00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:16.319
-It's okay.
-And the bruised stomach.

895
00:53:17.127 --> 00:53:18.594
And the blood clot.

896
00:53:21.164 --> 00:53:22.529
Nothing.

897
00:53:26.236 --> 00:53:28.397
You know damn welI that's your baby.

898
00:53:28.505 --> 00:53:32.532
You know it's yours. Got the same chin.
The same lip.

899
00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:35.509
That baby got the same head as you
and the same eye...

900
00:53:35.612 --> 00:53:37.978
Go take the test. Take the test.

901
00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:39.605
<i>You want to hear the test resuIts?</i>

902
00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.183
ln the case of the little baby...

903
00:53:41.284 --> 00:53:43.309
<i>Well, the test says that is your baby.</i>

904
00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.751
How you doing?

905
00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:49.122
Latimore Construction, Norbit speaking.

906
00:53:49.226 --> 00:53:50.818
<i>Hey, Norbit, it's Kate.</i>

907
00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:53.327
<i>Is there any way you can meet me</i>
<i>in town right now?</i>

908
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:54.590
Yeah, sure.

909
00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:56.028
<i>Great. I'm at McCormick's.</i>

910
00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:57.759
Okay. Fine.

911
00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:07.441
Rasputia, I'm just loaded up
with paperwork up to my ear.

912
00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:10.707
I was wondering, could you run
these permits downtown for me?

913
00:54:10.814 --> 00:54:13.044
Now you tell me
what in the hell I look like,

914
00:54:13.149 --> 00:54:16.414
running some goddamn permits
down to City Hall for your ass.

915
00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:17.621
You do it.

916
00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:17.916
You do it.

917
00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:19.915
Okay.

918
00:54:21.324 --> 00:54:23.189
-What's the surprise?
-No, I'm not telling you.

919
00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:25.921
TelI me. Hey, no, what are you doing?

920
00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:27.724
-Not tilI the last second.
-What? What?

921
00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:30.425
-You ready?
-Yeah, what is it?

922
00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:33.962
I know you don't think
I'm gonna get on that thing.

923
00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:36.300
-I think you're gonna get on that.
-Hey, no way. Hey.

924
00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:39.102
Come on! Look where you wanna go.
You're doing great.

925
00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:43.009
You got it? You got it? You got it?

926
00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:45.206
Watch out for the fence!

927
00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:48.681
And the mailbox.

928
00:54:50.353 --> 00:54:53.379
Rasputia, the painters from
the Crestview site got food poisoning.

929
00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.390
There's vomit everywhere!

930
00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:58.290
You know damn well
you clean up all the vomit. You do it!

931
00:54:58.395 --> 00:55:01.421
-I don't feel safe.
-Yeah! You're doing great!

932
00:55:04.534 --> 00:55:05.762
Yeah.

933
00:55:08.438 --> 00:55:11.532
The Portosans at Drummond's
tipped over!

934
00:55:11.641 --> 00:55:13.541
Well, go clean the shit up!

935
00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:26.520
Rasputia?

936
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:42.402
You do it!

937
00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:45.534
-I got it!
-Go!

938
00:55:45.642 --> 00:55:48.770
I'm getting it! I'm doing it!

939
00:55:48.878 --> 00:55:50.277
You're doing it! Yeah, but slow down!

940
00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.372
-How?
-With the brakes! The brakes!

941
00:55:58.888 --> 00:56:00.378
Oh, no. Are you okay?

942
00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:03.584
Yeah. Actually, that was kind of fun.

943
00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:07.623
-Come on.
-Okay, help me.

944
00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:09.858
-Okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

945
00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:16.536
So, I'm going to Giovanni's tonight
to choose the food for the reception.

946
00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:19.608
You wanna come? Help me decide?

947
00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:21.506
What about Deion?

948
00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:25.113
I just don't trust him with food.

949
00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:27.615
You know,
he made dinner for us the other night.

950
00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:29.912
It tasted like cheap take-out.

951
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:35.688
-Well, I'll go.
-Good.

952
00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:39.694
Well, I just have to go get my dress,
and then we can meet, say, at 7:00?

953
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:41.057
Okay, that's great.

954
00:56:41.164 --> 00:56:43.962
-Perfect, Norbit.
-Okay, see you at 7:00.

955
00:56:45.635 --> 00:56:46.659
Norbit!

956
00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.260
all right. Yeah, Norby.

957
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:50.305
7:00, don't be late.

958
00:56:50.974 --> 00:56:53.238
You guys are all pervs.

959
00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:56.810
I love it.

960
00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:00.112
What's wrong?

961
00:57:00.617 --> 00:57:02.744
Are you sure we're not rushing things?

962
00:57:02.852 --> 00:57:07.050
I know we're not. I know we're not.
I couldn't be happier.

963
00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:10.853
Norbit, that's a date.

964
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.292
No, it's not. She just wants someone...

965
00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:16.194
Are you paying for this encounter
this evening?

966
00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:17.288
Of course not!

967
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:21.131
Then that's a date.
Don't be trying to tell a pimp his game.

968
00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:23.764
Come on, baby.

969
00:57:26.509 --> 00:57:28.136
-Thank you.
-Carmen, honey!

970
00:57:28.244 --> 00:57:29.711
all right.

971
00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:34.242
Well, who are you getting all fine for?

972
00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:37.217
Hello, Rasputia. Well, that's nice.

973
00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.254
Oh, yeah, right.
Why you trying to look all extra today?

974
00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:42.882
Oh, I'm just, you know, being a girl.

975
00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:48.688
My fiancé likes it
when I take care of myself.

976
00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:50.823
Look to me like
that fish already in his net.

977
00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:53.164
You look like
you fixing to catch you a new fish.

978
00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:57.103
What? No. God. Don't be silly.

979
00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:00.271
You're married. You're here.

980
00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:01.934
I don't do this for my husband.

981
00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:04.707
Girl, I do this
because I have a reputation to uphold.

982
00:58:04.814 --> 00:58:08.841
Everybody in this town know that
Rasputia Latimore is fine. Ain't I fine?

983
00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:10.886
-You fine, girl! You are fine.
-Sister!

984
00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:12.181
Everybody knows.

985
00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:15.223
But even a delicate flower like me
need a little water from time to time.

986
00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:17.691
Or a little lye in her kitchen
to help straighten out them petaIs.

987
00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:19.022
How you doing?

988
00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:20.356
Rasputia.

989
00:58:20.463 --> 00:58:22.431
Helga waiting on you, girl,
to do your bikini wax.

990
00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:23.760
Here I come, girl.

991
00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:27.132
I got to go, girl. Every now and then
I got to mow the lawn.

992
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:31.036
You just make sure
all that sprucing up is for your fiancé.

993
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:36.206
Helga, here I come, girl.
It's a fulI moon, too.

994
00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:41.880
Here we go, dear.

995
00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:51.418
I was looking for Norbit's police whistle.

996
00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:52.886
Go fish.

997
00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:54.630
What's up?

998
00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:56.665
Everything on schedule
with the wedding?

999
00:58:56.766 --> 00:58:58.757
I got my own problems, but I'll handle it.

1000
00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:00.563
What's this situation
you're talking about?

1001
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:02.638
The liquor license on the orphanage.

1002
00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:05.606
It won't rolI over
when the property changes hands,

1003
00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:08.040
not without one of
these transfer requests upfront.

1004
00:59:08.144 --> 00:59:10.476
Yeah, and getting a new license
could take years.

1005
00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:13.276
Yeah, we'd be out of business
before we get started.

1006
00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:15.044
You think you can get Kate to sign that?

1007
00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:17.813
Hell, no. She's planning on
closing the restaurant.

1008
00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:19.548
It'd raise too many suspicions.

1009
00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:21.851
all right, smart-ass,
then what we gonna do now?

1010
00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:24.392
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1011
00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:28.886
Norbit.

1012
00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:33.567
-Where you going, Norbit?
-Sit your punk ass down.

1013
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:37.766
Guys, I told Rasputia
the toilet needed to be reinforced

1014
00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:39.466
and she said
that I should take care of it,

1015
00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:40.770
so I'm gonna go take care of that.

1016
00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:41.935
Forget that.

1017
00:59:42.045 --> 00:59:43.706
I can't. No, guys,
it's an accident waiting to happen.

1018
00:59:43.813 --> 00:59:45.781
-I have to deaI with it.
-I said forget that.

1019
00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:47.474
We need you to
get these papers signed tonight.

1020
00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:48.573
Oh, no. I can't do it tonight, guys.

1021
00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:50.744
There's an accident waiting to happen.
I have to deaI with this...

1022
00:59:50.853 --> 00:59:53.481
Norbit, if you don't
get these papers signed tonight,

1023
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.353
we can't start
the remodeI on the orphanage.

1024
00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:56.482
That's right, punk ass.

1025
00:59:56.593 --> 00:59:59.153
BulIshit. I'm going for mine tonight.
I got things to do!

1026
00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.321
Norbit, you better find that Kate Thomas

1027
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.796
and get her to sign.

1028
01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.059
Yeah.

1029
01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.160
Kate Thomas?

1030
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:08.965
You want me to get these papers
to Kate Thomas?

1031
01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.266
Yeah.

1032
01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:11.662
Okay, that's more important.

1033
01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.969
I'll take care of this for you guys.
I'll get these to Kate Thomas.

1034
01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:16.602
-That's what I told you to do.
-Get your punk ass up.

1035
01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:17.975
Okay, I'm gonna go take these to Kate

1036
01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:20.106
and take my punk ass to Kate Thomas
right now.

1037
01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:22.081
Excuse me, pardon me.
Let me get through here. Thank you.

1038
01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:24.676
-Excuse me. Going through. Hi.
-Bitch ass.

1039
01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:27.381
Yes, I am a bitch ass. Excuse me.
Kate Thomas.

1040
01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:32.026
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1041
01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:34.695
Man, it's time for
a pimpallcious makeover. Let's do this.

1042
01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:37.288
all right. But nothing too flashy now.
I wanna be flashy, but not...

1043
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.391
Class. I don't want no....

1044
01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.609
Now, that's pimping.

1045
01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.208
all right, hair's bigger.

1046
01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:19.700
Okay. Well, I guess this is it, guys.
Thanks a lot for all your help.

1047
01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.634
Thanks for making me fly.

1048
01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.939
You fly like a flock of birds, baby.

1049
01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:26.645
-You look good.
-Thanks, guys.

1050
01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:30.446
-Handle this business for us, brother.
-I'm gonna handle it. Gonna handle it.

1051
01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:32.416
-Do the walk, Norbit.
-I got you.

1052
01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.513
Yeah. Norbit!

1053
01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:44.389
Wow, Norbit!

1054
01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:48.165
I just picked these
on the side of the road,

1055
01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:50.899
'cause this is just a casuaI get-together.

1056
01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:54.943
Sure. And you put the wires
up the stems, too. That's a nice touch.

1057
01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:57.610
-Norbit!
-Hey, Sam.

1058
01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:02.382
You dressed to kill, huh?

1059
01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:05.454
Katerina, you look beautiful.
Come sit, please.

1060
01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.715
I'm making my speciaIty just for you.

1061
01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:13.091
Hey. Did you make my favorite?

1062
01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:14.993
What do you think, huh?

1063
01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:18.893
I'm gonna take the flowers,
put them into water, okay?

1064
01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:20.926
He's a nice man.

1065
01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.331
Your favorite?

1066
01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.806
I guess you and Rasputia
come here a lot, huh?

1067
01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:29.605
Oh, no. We used to,
but she got banned for life

1068
01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:31.771
because Sam had
an all-you-can-eat buffet once

1069
01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:35.874
and she took it as a personaI challenge,
and it got pretty ugly.

1070
01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.519
I wanna make a toast.

1071
01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:39.918
Oh, sure.

1072
01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:44.657
To old friends.

1073
01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.729
To old friends.

1074
01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:52.025
We were buddy partners, all right,
Norbit. We were.

1075
01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:57.038
I tell you, you know,

1076
01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:01.440
sometimes I think
I should've never married Rasputia.

1077
01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:03.708
What do you mean, Norbit?

1078
01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:07.078
I was just really young, you know,
and she latched on to me

1079
01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:11.449
and kind of helped me fit in
and gave me a family, so...

1080
01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:15.054
We had nobody, Norbit.

1081
01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:18.616
I mean, who can blame us
for wanting to feel safe, you know?

1082
01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:21.627
Yeah, safe.

1083
01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:23.928
Like you and Deion?

1084
01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:26.527
Yeah.

1085
01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:33.440
I mean,
it's different with Deion, obviously.

1086
01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:38.608
So, what have you got here?

1087
01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:41.410
Those are just construction papers,

1088
01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:44.042
permits and stuff that you have to sign.

1089
01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:48.780
Kate, can I ask you
a personaI question?

1090
01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:50.483
Sure, what?

1091
01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:56.860
Do you love Deion?

1092
01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:01.897
Of course. Yeah.

1093
01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:07.865
Otherwise,
why would I be marrying him, right?

1094
01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:10.703
Right?

1095
01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:17.244
-Got your pizza.
-It is about time.

1096
01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.687
I'm about to disappear up in here
I'm so hungry.

1097
01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.621
Norbit out draining a swamp
or something.

1098
01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:27.992
Yeah, he's definitely draining a swamp.
He's draining a swamp like he would be.

1099
01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:35.566
-Why you looking at me like that?
-Where's Norbit?

1100
01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:39.801
Draining a swamp.
And why are you looking at me like that?

1101
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:44.510
He's out there in the woods,
draining a swamp. I told you before.

1102
01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:48.642
I don't know nothing.

1103
01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:52.247
I don't know nothing, okay?

1104
01:04:58.094 --> 01:05:01.723
He's on a date with that fine skinny girl!

1105
01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:14.602
It's pain time here! I ain't having this!

1106
01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:18.611
Oh, hell, no. And on top of that
he been messing with my seat again?

1107
01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:20.375
Damn it, Norbit!

1108
01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.819
He got me destroying my shit.

1109
01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.597
This is it.

1110
01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.760
It's always so beautifuI in here.

1111
01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:42.828
Peaceful.

1112
01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:45.371
-Hello, Kate, Norbit.
-Hey.

1113
01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:48.875
Didn't know anybody was here.
I was getting ready to close up shop.

1114
01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:52.709
You know, Kate,
this all happened so fast,

1115
01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:56.080
I reallzed we never had
a chance to rehearse.

1116
01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:57.914
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1117
01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.112
So, come on up here.

1118
01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:01.689
Let me at least show you
where you're gonna stand.

1119
01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.383
-Come on.
-all right.

1120
01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:09.563
Rasputia. You know
you no allowed in here.

1121
01:06:09.665 --> 01:06:11.860
The hell with that. Where's Norbit?

1122
01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:15.233
I don't see Norbit.
Anybody is a see Norbit?

1123
01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.771
-No.
-He hasn't been here.

1124
01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:21.673
Then who was eating a turkey ass?

1125
01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:25.273
Run! Run! Run!

1126
01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.679
At which point
you'll give your vows to Deion.

1127
01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:32.649
You want to practice those?

1128
01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:37.688
Well, I hadn't actually gotten to that
quite yet.

1129
01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:40.020
You don't even know
what you're gonna say yet?

1130
01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:44.123
Well, what would you say, Norbit?
I don't know.

1131
01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:46.066
What would I say?

1132
01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:49.430
Norbit!

1133
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:58.812
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was hot like me</i>

1134
01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:03.010
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was a freak like me</i>

1135
01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.086
<i>Don't cha</i>

1136
01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:07.015
What would I say if I was saying vows?

1137
01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:09.021
I guess...

1138
01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:11.218
Kate,

1139
01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:14.853
I think about you all day long.

1140
01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:19.495
And when I'm not near you,

1141
01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:22.435
all I think about is being near you.

1142
01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:24.233
And when you are near me,

1143
01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.002
I feel like I'm at peace
with the whole world.

1144
01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:31.111
I know that...

1145
01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.611
I know I'll never have to
ask God for anything

1146
01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:37.015
'cause, as long as I have you in my life,

1147
01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:40.520
I got everything I ever wanted.

1148
01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:46.723
And the only thing
I really wanna do is just

1149
01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:51.698
spend the rest of my life making you
as happy as you've made me.

1150
01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:55.570
Because I love you, Kate.

1151
01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.432
I love you.

1152
01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:03.878
I don't know. Something like that.

1153
01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.008
And after the vows you would then...

1154
01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:10.007
Okay.

1155
01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.185
Oh, my God.

1156
01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.918
I'm sorry, I have to go.

1157
01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:48.052
I'm sorry.

1158
01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:58.866
-Awkward.
-Yeah.

1159
01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:08.838
Give me that crowbar.
I got some killing to do.

1160
01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:22.918
Damn it!

1161
01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:27.322
I'm a Christian. You got me
up in this church cursing, Norbit.

1162
01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:31.827
Death do us part, huh? Okay, Norbit.

1163
01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:34.061
Look like you done moved up
the goddamn schedule.

1164
01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.728
I'm cursing again.

1165
01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:36.995
Pray, bitch, pray.

1166
01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:38.733
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1167
01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:42.333
Thy kingdom come, thy wilI be done
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1168
01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:45.970
Kate, please. Kate, please, I'm sorry.

1169
01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:47.275
Kate, please, stop and talk to me.

1170
01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:49.248
Please, please, Kate.
Talk to me, please.

1171
01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:51.114
I can't, Norbit.

1172
01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:53.283
I'm just too confused right now.

1173
01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:56.847
I'm sorry. It was all my fauIt.
I never should have kissed you.

1174
01:09:57.493 --> 01:09:58.960
No.

1175
01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:03.424
I wanted you to.

1176
01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:08.228
That's why I'm so confused.

1177
01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.297
Good night.

1178
01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:25.180
She wanted me to.

1179
01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:37.460
-Where the papers at, Norbit?
-Got them for you right here.

1180
01:10:43.839 --> 01:10:46.273
I'd hate to be you right now.

1181
01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:47.776
Why?

1182
01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:50.674
Go on in the house.

1183
01:10:51.313 --> 01:10:52.678
Go on in.

1184
01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:58.615
Go ahead, fool. What you waiting for?

1185
01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:00.348
Get on in.

1186
01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:14.259
Hello?

1187
01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:20.103
Chocolate drop, I'm home.

1188
01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.976
Lollipop?

1189
01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:27.041
Mail.

1190
01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.520
Expecting a letter, Norbit?

1191
01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:40.319
You frightened me.
No, I was just looking through.

1192
01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:42.726
How was your date?

1193
01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:44.594
Date?

1194
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:49.135
That was no date. That was just...

1195
01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:53.868
I just was over at
what's-her-name's wedding rehearsal.

1196
01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:58.576
That's all. It wasn't a date, though.

1197
01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.382
Oh, really?

1198
01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:22.865
Lloyd. Is that you, Lloyd?

1199
01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:26.000
Lloyd, what am I gonna do?

1200
01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:28.202
KilI the bitch.

1201
01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:30.669
Excuse me? What'd you say?

1202
01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:35.443
You heard me. Rub her out.
Take her down. lce the bitch.

1203
01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:39.345
Hey. Lloyd, you're talking.

1204
01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:43.186
She took my legs, Norbit.
She took my legs.

1205
01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:46.261
You know what it's like to be a dog
with no legs?

1206
01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.159
I can't raise one up to pee.

1207
01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:53.166
Hell, I can't even hump no more, Norbit.
Humping was my thing.

1208
01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:55.498
What is this, Norbit?

1209
01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:01.776
Some kind of weird, satanic potato art?

1210
01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:04.774
What's this?

1211
01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.440
It looks like the acid
that we use down at the quarry.

1212
01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:08.675
Right!

1213
01:13:08.784 --> 01:13:11.480
But this is
Miss Pretty Little Thang's little face.

1214
01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:15.751
And, Norbit, if you ever see her again,
if you ever talk to her again,

1215
01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:18.190
if you ever so much
as think about the bitch again,

1216
01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:20.853
this is what's gonna happen to her.

1217
01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:28.561
How you doing?

1218
01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:31.666
You get the picture, Norbit?

1219
01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:36.409
Deion, I just think that
we need to take a beat.

1220
01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:38.742
It's not you, it's me.

1221
01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:41.577
Just if we slow down, l...

1222
01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:43.514
Oh, good, you're up.

1223
01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:46.417
-Deion, we need to talk.
-Yes, we do.

1224
01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:49.582
I was just at Latimore Construction,
you know, with the renovation plans,

1225
01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:52.125
and I found this on Big Black's desk.

1226
01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:53.786
What is it?

1227
01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:56.228
It's a request to renew
the Golden Wonton's liquor license

1228
01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:58.925
and put it in the Latimores' name.

1229
01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:00.726
What?

1230
01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:03.304
Baby, you signed it yesterday.
Look at the date.

1231
01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:05.805
No. No, I didn't sign anything.

1232
01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:10.409
Just some permits
that Norbit gave me, but...

1233
01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:12.776
Well, did you read them?

1234
01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:15.708
-No.
-No. Great.

1235
01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:17.285
I don't get it, though, Deion.

1236
01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:19.411
Why would the Latimores
want me to renew the liquor license

1237
01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:20.749
at the orphanage?

1238
01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:22.585
Baby, people say
they've been trying to get their hands on

1239
01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.921
that orphanage for years.

1240
01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:27.928
Apparently they want to turn it
into a strip joint.

1241
01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:29.491
Disgusting.

1242
01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:32.698
First you gonna clean the basement,
then you gonna clean the garage,

1243
01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.769
then you gonna go upstairs
and clean the attic.

1244
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.997
We don't even have an attic.

1245
01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:40.632
Well, then you build a damn attic, then,
Norbit! And then clean it!

1246
01:14:40.742 --> 01:14:43.609
I'm going upstairs to take a bubble bath.

1247
01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:51.684
Bitch! You bitch!

1248
01:14:53.917 --> 01:14:55.544
Finally.

1249
01:14:55.652 --> 01:14:59.952
I needed this.
Let me submerge this ass.

1250
01:15:00.057 --> 01:15:01.922
How you doing?

1251
01:15:05.262 --> 01:15:06.889
Good and hot.

1252
01:15:07.431 --> 01:15:09.899
Sounds like it's raining outside.

1253
01:15:20.544 --> 01:15:21.670
Oh, no.

1254
01:15:22.479 --> 01:15:23.673
Kate!

1255
01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:24.747
Norbit.

1256
01:15:24.848 --> 01:15:27.043
Over here. Over here.

1257
01:15:28.218 --> 01:15:29.776
I need to talk to you.

1258
01:15:29.886 --> 01:15:33.049
Do you know what was in those papers
you had me sign last night?

1259
01:15:33.156 --> 01:15:35.021
Yeah, the construction permits.

1260
01:15:35.125 --> 01:15:37.252
No, that's not all.

1261
01:15:40.897 --> 01:15:42.125
Norbit.

1262
01:15:42.432 --> 01:15:46.095
Hey, just... Just go away, Kate!
Get out of here!

1263
01:15:46.203 --> 01:15:47.363
What?

1264
01:15:49.573 --> 01:15:52.167
You heard what I said!
Just get out of here! Scram!

1265
01:15:52.275 --> 01:15:55.972
The Latimores are trying to
take controI of the orphanage, Norbit.

1266
01:15:56.079 --> 01:16:00.140
Well, why don't you go and find
somebody who gives a rat's ass,

1267
01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:02.810
because I sure as hell don't!

1268
01:16:03.386 --> 01:16:06.480
-You don't care?
-No, I don't care.

1269
01:16:08.058 --> 01:16:10.925
-And I don't care about you, either!
-Norbit.

1270
01:16:11.027 --> 01:16:14.758
The only woman I have ever,
ever loved and ever cared about

1271
01:16:14.865 --> 01:16:18.392
was my darling wife, Rasputia!

1272
01:16:20.604 --> 01:16:21.628
But last night...

1273
01:16:21.738 --> 01:16:26.266
Last night I was just trying to naiI you,
you know, score?

1274
01:16:26.743 --> 01:16:28.904
But now I reallze I don't have to do that!

1275
01:16:29.012 --> 01:16:34.575
all I need is my beautiful,
precious wife Rasputia!

1276
01:16:35.519 --> 01:16:39.956
She's all the woman I need, so
you can just go on and get out of here,

1277
01:16:40.056 --> 01:16:42.547
you screwy dame! Who needs you?

1278
01:16:43.593 --> 01:16:45.493
Damn, Norbit.

1279
01:16:45.595 --> 01:16:48.792
Did that skinny little thing
figure out your plan?

1280
01:16:48.899 --> 01:16:52.460
Girl, you just don't get it, do you?
Norbit played you.

1281
01:16:52.569 --> 01:16:54.867
You got her to sign those papers,
didn't you?

1282
01:16:54.971 --> 01:16:56.666
Yes, darling.

1283
01:16:57.574 --> 01:16:59.235
He been setting you up
from that moment

1284
01:16:59.342 --> 01:17:01.435
from the very first day you got here.

1285
01:17:01.545 --> 01:17:02.910
How you doing?

1286
01:17:03.847 --> 01:17:06.714
Don't you ever talk to me again!

1287
01:17:08.151 --> 01:17:09.209
Kate.

1288
01:17:09.319 --> 01:17:12.015
Damn, Norbit,
you pissing off everybody today.

1289
01:17:12.122 --> 01:17:17.355
Don't you ever talk to me again!
Don't you ever talk to me again!

1290
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:21.058
Never again!

1291
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:54.761
Hey, Norbit.

1292
01:17:56.299 --> 01:17:58.563
Mr. Wong,
what are you doing around here?

1293
01:17:58.668 --> 01:18:02.399
I just going for a walk, Norbit.
Just going for a walk.

1294
01:18:02.505 --> 01:18:06.134
I live in this neighborhood long time.
Long time.

1295
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:09.103
Soon I be moving on.

1296
01:18:09.212 --> 01:18:11.737
Yes, as I look around this neighborhood,

1297
01:18:11.848 --> 01:18:15.375
I reallze there
no good dry cleaners here.

1298
01:18:15.485 --> 01:18:17.180
I could make killing.

1299
01:18:17.287 --> 01:18:18.652
Why you got suitcase?

1300
01:18:18.755 --> 01:18:21.815
I'm getting the H out of here.
I'm leaving town for good.

1301
01:18:21.925 --> 01:18:23.051
What? Leaving town?

1302
01:18:23.159 --> 01:18:26.424
I thought you stick around,
help Kate run orphanage.

1303
01:18:26.963 --> 01:18:28.555
She's getting married
to Deion tomorrow,

1304
01:18:28.665 --> 01:18:31.156
so there's no reason
for me to stay around here.

1305
01:18:31.268 --> 01:18:32.758
No reason?

1306
01:18:32.936 --> 01:18:34.597
No, she won't even see me.

1307
01:18:34.704 --> 01:18:37.002
And besides,
I'll just wind up getting hurt again.

1308
01:18:37.107 --> 01:18:40.440
Norbit, you listen to me.
You very speciaI to me.

1309
01:18:41.244 --> 01:18:45.408
I love you like my own child,
like boy child, not girI child.

1310
01:18:45.515 --> 01:18:47.881
Wong once have girI child
back in Shanghai.

1311
01:18:47.984 --> 01:18:50.509
When she two years old,
I trade her for yak.

1312
01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.180
That sort of thing happen in China
from time to time.

1313
01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:54.951
Yak very hard to come by.

1314
01:18:55.058 --> 01:18:57.788
Oh, yeah, sure. I appreciate that.

1315
01:18:57.894 --> 01:19:00.761
You can't run
from your problems, Norbit.

1316
01:19:00.864 --> 01:19:04.800
Black people run fast,
but problem even faster.

1317
01:19:05.435 --> 01:19:07.027
That's kind of racist.

1318
01:19:07.137 --> 01:19:11.267
Yes. Wong very racist. I no like black.
I no like Jew either.

1319
01:19:11.374 --> 01:19:14.138
But black and Jew love Chinese food.
Go figure.

1320
01:19:15.045 --> 01:19:17.479
Always remember two things, Norbit.

1321
01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:22.040
One, even though you're very ugly,

1322
01:19:22.152 --> 01:19:24.985
you're very strong inside, like warrior.

1323
01:19:25.088 --> 01:19:29.388
And two, maiI come late on Friday.

1324
01:19:31.227 --> 01:19:33.388
Wong Dry Cleaning.

1325
01:19:34.197 --> 01:19:35.960
It could have been huge.

1326
01:19:36.066 --> 01:19:39.729
You don't even have to clean nothing,
you just spray with starch.

1327
01:20:00.123 --> 01:20:01.283
Mr...

1328
01:20:06.363 --> 01:20:08.228
I gotta warn Kate.

1329
01:20:16.906 --> 01:20:17.930
<i>Hello?</i>

1330
01:20:18.041 --> 01:20:20.134
Hello, Kate. Kate, it's Norbit.
I have to talk to you.

1331
01:20:20.243 --> 01:20:23.644
<i>-Please don't call me anymore.</i>
-No, Kate, it's very important.

1332
01:20:25.248 --> 01:20:26.579
Kate?

1333
01:20:39.696 --> 01:20:40.924
Going somewhere, Norbit?

1334
01:20:41.031 --> 01:20:43.363
No, I was... No.

1335
01:20:43.466 --> 01:20:45.127
What did I tell you
about leaving this house?

1336
01:20:45.235 --> 01:20:47.703
I was just going to get some fresh air.

1337
01:20:47.804 --> 01:20:50.398
Boy, you ain't going nowhere
tilI after that wedding's done.

1338
01:20:50.507 --> 01:20:52.134
We got too much riding on that.

1339
01:20:52.242 --> 01:20:54.210
What do you have
riding on the wedding?

1340
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:56.505
Soon as your little friend says, "I do,"

1341
01:20:56.613 --> 01:20:59.878
Deion and us is gonna
turn the orphanage into a titty bar.

1342
01:21:00.216 --> 01:21:02.446
But what about the little orphans?

1343
01:21:02.552 --> 01:21:05.612
Hell, they can come too,
if they pay the cover.

1344
01:21:07.857 --> 01:21:10.690
John the Baptist, stop their eviI plan.

1345
01:21:11.494 --> 01:21:13.519
Get your ass down in the basement.

1346
01:21:14.064 --> 01:21:15.588
Get down there!

1347
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:26.204
It's a madhouse! A madhouse!

1348
01:21:42.392 --> 01:21:45.020
-Come on, Rasputia! We gonna be late.
-Yeah.

1349
01:21:45.128 --> 01:21:47.062
I know y'all better stop rushing me.

1350
01:21:47.163 --> 01:21:49.631
Beauty takes time.
This don't just happen.

1351
01:21:49.732 --> 01:21:50.994
Oh, no.

1352
01:21:51.301 --> 01:21:52.268
You get out the car.

1353
01:21:52.368 --> 01:21:52.735
You gonna stay here
and make sure Norbit don't go no place.

1354
01:21:52.735 --> 01:21:54.168
You gonna stay here
and make sure Norbit don't go no place.

1355
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:56.795
What? Why I gotta stay?

1356
01:21:56.906 --> 01:21:59.374
Because everybody know
you the smartest.

1357
01:22:16.292 --> 01:22:19.887
Three minutes to show time.
Not too late to chicken out.

1358
01:22:20.563 --> 01:22:22.360
No, I'm ready.

1359
01:22:22.665 --> 01:22:24.929
Okay. You look beautiful.

1360
01:22:43.453 --> 01:22:45.853
<i>P-O-W-E-R.</i>

1361
01:22:45.955 --> 01:22:50.153
<i>T to the A to the mother-stanking P.</i>
<i>Power-tap the fat, move back.</i>

1362
01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:52.057
<i>Power-tap the fat, move back.</i>

1363
01:23:11.514 --> 01:23:13.072
What are the Latimores doing here?

1364
01:23:13.183 --> 01:23:16.482
Don't worry. It's your day.
You look beautiful.

1365
01:23:25.962 --> 01:23:27.224
Nuts.

1366
01:23:27.797 --> 01:23:30.391
<i>-Tap, tap, tap. Tap it off.</i>
-Tap, tap. Tap...

1367
01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.328
Norbit!

1368
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:36.734
Norbit? Norbit?

1369
01:23:38.708 --> 01:23:40.608
Oh, damn. He escaped.

1370
01:23:41.444 --> 01:23:43.275
Norbit! Norbit!

1371
01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.339
Your ass is mine, Norbit!

1372
01:23:55.925 --> 01:23:57.222
Yeah.

1373
01:24:01.831 --> 01:24:03.856
-Just now? Shit.
-Is he all right?

1374
01:24:04.267 --> 01:24:06.497
Norbit escaped. He gonna be
headed this way. Come on.

1375
01:24:06.603 --> 01:24:08.070
Hell, no.

1376
01:24:11.808 --> 01:24:14.242
-Norbit is coming.
-For shizzle?

1377
01:24:14.344 --> 01:24:16.505
We have to figure out way
to stall wedding.

1378
01:24:16.613 --> 01:24:17.944
Just calm down, Mr. Wong.

1379
01:24:18.047 --> 01:24:21.278
I've ruined plenty of weddings
back in the day. I got this.

1380
01:24:21.884 --> 01:24:23.715
Dearly beloved,

1381
01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:27.916
we are gathered here today
to join these two in holy matrimony.

1382
01:24:28.024 --> 01:24:30.720
Your Honor, I object!

1383
01:24:31.394 --> 01:24:34.886
Object? Sir, we've not gotten to
that part yet.

1384
01:24:34.998 --> 01:24:38.866
Then I'm objeculating prematurely,
Reverend.

1385
01:24:40.403 --> 01:24:43.770
No offense, my brother, but we're just
trying to keep the train rolling here.

1386
01:24:43.873 --> 01:24:47.206
Oh, well, if you want to
get the train rolling, you know...

1387
01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:49.471
You got to use the big "L".

1388
01:24:50.813 --> 01:24:51.837
Lesbians.

1389
01:24:51.948 --> 01:24:54.109
No, man.
I ain't talking about no lesbians.

1390
01:24:54.217 --> 01:24:55.775
-AIthough, late at night.
-Yes.

1391
01:24:55.885 --> 01:24:57.409
-Right?
-Yes.

1392
01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:00.521
-No, brother, we talking about love.
-Love.

1393
01:25:00.623 --> 01:25:06.255
Love is the engine
that drives the train forward, backwards,

1394
01:25:06.362 --> 01:25:11.129
side to side,
round and round love does go.

1395
01:25:11.234 --> 01:25:13.794
You understand me? I got this, brother.

1396
01:25:13.903 --> 01:25:18.340
I'm not talking about no $20 up in here,
back seat of the car,

1397
01:25:18.441 --> 01:25:20.409
stanky-stanky, hanky-panky.

1398
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:21.477
-No.
-No.

1399
01:25:21.577 --> 01:25:23.977
I'm talking about good, wholesome,

1400
01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.072
fortified with
eight essentiaI vitamins love.

1401
01:25:27.183 --> 01:25:28.616
That cost anywhere...

1402
01:25:28.718 --> 01:25:29.707
How much it cost?

1403
01:25:29.819 --> 01:25:33.880
About $136, Monday through Fridays.
$212 on the weekends.

1404
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:36.823
Because of inflation.
Can I get an "Amen"?

1405
01:25:36.926 --> 01:25:38.018
Amen!

1406
01:25:48.338 --> 01:25:50.238
Where the hell you going, Norbit?

1407
01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:53.366
None of your GD beeswax, Rasputia!

1408
01:25:53.476 --> 01:25:55.467
Look at you, you old stupid fool.
You can't even ride a bike.

1409
01:25:55.578 --> 01:25:58.570
Oh, yes, I can, because Kate taught me!

1410
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:12.222
Brothers and sisters.
This particular one's for the brothers.

1411
01:26:12.328 --> 01:26:16.025
When you buy the ones that say,
"Ribbed for her pleasure,"

1412
01:26:16.132 --> 01:26:20.728
turn them inside out
and they ribbed for your pleasure.

1413
01:26:20.837 --> 01:26:23.067
-Can I get an "Amen"?
-Amen!

1414
01:26:23.172 --> 01:26:25.663
Now, speaking of ribs and pleasure.

1415
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:30.578
Yes. For a limited time only,
we are proud to present to you

1416
01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.877
our barbeque, baby back, horseradish,

1417
01:26:33.983 --> 01:26:36.918
mustard and
peanut butter-encrusted ribs

1418
01:26:37.019 --> 01:26:41.718
with a slight Jagermeister infusion
sprinkled with chamomile leaves

1419
01:26:41.824 --> 01:26:46.523
with a horseradish
and dandelion salad on a bed of rice.

1420
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:49.723
Buy one Pimp Platter,
get the whole bones free.

1421
01:26:49.866 --> 01:26:52.858
No, no, no! That's enough talking.

1422
01:26:52.969 --> 01:26:54.903
It's time to get back to the wedding.

1423
01:26:55.004 --> 01:26:59.634
It ain't never enough talking
when you talking about love, brother.

1424
01:26:59.742 --> 01:27:01.937
-Ain't that right?
-Yeah!

1425
01:27:02.044 --> 01:27:03.602
Let me hear you say it, people!

1426
01:27:03.713 --> 01:27:04.737
Love!

1427
01:27:04.847 --> 01:27:06.872
Let me hear you sing it, choir!

1428
01:27:06.983 --> 01:27:09.076
<i>Love!</i>

1429
01:27:21.664 --> 01:27:23.188
-I'm gonna rip your head off.
-Rasputia.

1430
01:27:23.299 --> 01:27:24.698
-What?
-Car!

1431
01:27:24.801 --> 01:27:26.496
I don't give a damn about no car.
I'm ready to die.

1432
01:27:26.602 --> 01:27:27.967
Car!

1433
01:27:29.939 --> 01:27:31.964
I'm ready to die!

1434
01:27:33.443 --> 01:27:34.467
I'm ready to die.

1435
01:27:34.577 --> 01:27:37.375
I ain't gonna let you ruin Nipplopolis
for me, boy! Damn!

1436
01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.471
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die up in here.

1437
01:27:39.916 --> 01:27:41.508
Drive the car, God damn it!

1438
01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:51.786
What's up, white man?
Pay for your sins. Pay for your sins.

1439
01:27:52.061 --> 01:27:54.359
We gonna change your name to Leroy.

1440
01:28:50.887 --> 01:28:52.752
Amen!

1441
01:28:57.126 --> 01:28:58.252
That's enough!

1442
01:28:58.361 --> 01:29:01.660
That's enough! Enough! Enough!
Enough! Enough!

1443
01:29:01.931 --> 01:29:03.694
-Stop the music!
-Hold on.

1444
01:29:03.833 --> 01:29:06.165
Shut up! You two, shut up!

1445
01:29:06.269 --> 01:29:08.100
That's it. This is husband-and-wife time.

1446
01:29:08.204 --> 01:29:11.833
Now, let's go. Let's go.
Husband-and-wife stuff.

1447
01:29:13.943 --> 01:29:14.910
Dearly beloved,

1448
01:29:15.912 --> 01:29:17.140
we are gathered here today...

1449
01:29:17.246 --> 01:29:18.543
I object!

1450
01:29:18.648 --> 01:29:20.013
Oh, for Christ's sake!

1451
01:29:20.449 --> 01:29:21.939
-Norbit.
-Norbit.

1452
01:29:22.051 --> 01:29:23.040
Norbit.

1453
01:29:23.152 --> 01:29:25.950
<i>Norbit</i>

1454
01:29:26.722 --> 01:29:29.418
This wedding is a sham
and I'm here to stop it.

1455
01:29:29.525 --> 01:29:31.493
Norbit, what are you doing?

1456
01:29:31.594 --> 01:29:35.257
I'm being a man
for the first time in my life. Kate...

1457
01:29:36.098 --> 01:29:38.032
Kate, I love you.

1458
01:29:39.602 --> 01:29:41.934
What the hell did you just say?

1459
01:29:43.339 --> 01:29:46.069
You heard what I said, strumpet.
I love Kate!

1460
01:29:46.175 --> 01:29:48.473
That's right. I love you, Kate.

1461
01:29:48.578 --> 01:29:51.911
And the last two weeks I spent with you
have meant more to me

1462
01:29:52.014 --> 01:29:54.847
than my whole entire miserable life
with you, Rasputia!

1463
01:29:54.951 --> 01:30:00.082
It's over! Norbit Albert Rice
is no longer your bitch!

1464
01:30:05.161 --> 01:30:06.526
You're dead! Get off me!

1465
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:08.221
Get your hands off me, Black.
Don't go hitting me.

1466
01:30:08.331 --> 01:30:10.561
What's wrong with you, girl?
What's wrong with you? Get off of me.

1467
01:30:10.666 --> 01:30:11.826
You don't talk like that with me.

1468
01:30:11.934 --> 01:30:12.901
No, wait!

1469
01:30:13.002 --> 01:30:14.264
No, no, wait, baby girl,
he's ruining our wedding.

1470
01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:15.667
Let's just get back to the nuptiaIs.

1471
01:30:15.771 --> 01:30:18.467
We just heard condom advice
from an ex-pimp.

1472
01:30:18.574 --> 01:30:21.168
I think we can survive
a few words from Norbit.

1473
01:30:21.277 --> 01:30:24.269
Deion is a fake. He's marrying you
just to get your money.

1474
01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:25.369
What?

1475
01:30:25.481 --> 01:30:28.575
Him and the Latimores.
They thought this whole scheme up.

1476
01:30:28.684 --> 01:30:31.847
He's been married four times in the
last six years to four different women,

1477
01:30:31.954 --> 01:30:34.980
and he cheated the women
out of $300,000 in divorce settlements.

1478
01:30:35.091 --> 01:30:36.854
Yeah, I heard all about it!
And something eIse.

1479
01:30:36.959 --> 01:30:39.154
They were gonna try to steal
the orphanage from you.

1480
01:30:39.261 --> 01:30:40.489
That's what this whole thing is about!

1481
01:30:40.596 --> 01:30:43.759
You crazy! He's got a big crush on you.
He's making this stuff up.

1482
01:30:43.866 --> 01:30:45.663
Oh, yeah? I'm crazy?
I'm making it all up?

1483
01:30:45.768 --> 01:30:47.998
-Yes, you making it up.
-Then what about this, then?

1484
01:30:48.104 --> 01:30:50.800
This evidence that I have.
Look at this!

1485
01:30:52.208 --> 01:30:54.142
This, well...

1486
01:30:54.343 --> 01:30:57.938
This used to, before it felI in the pond,
it had numbers

1487
01:30:58.047 --> 01:30:59.514
and there was information.

1488
01:30:59.615 --> 01:31:02.709
There was people's names
and dates and addresses

1489
01:31:02.818 --> 01:31:05.412
and all kinds of incriminating things.

1490
01:31:05.521 --> 01:31:09.821
I felI in the pond, but you can't read it.
But, boy, did I have your ass!

1491
01:31:10.059 --> 01:31:13.426
That's nice, Norbit. Really nice.
Did you write that yourself? Pathetic.

1492
01:31:13.529 --> 01:31:15.087
Kate, you have to believe me.

1493
01:31:15.197 --> 01:31:16.425
Yeah, yeah, believe him, Kate.

1494
01:31:16.532 --> 01:31:18.966
Remember the one that got you to sign
the papers to steaI the orphanage?

1495
01:31:19.068 --> 01:31:21.298
Remember that?
Believe him. Go ahead.

1496
01:31:21.804 --> 01:31:26.241
I'm so sorry, Norbit.
I just don't trust you anymore.

1497
01:31:31.313 --> 01:31:34.339
Well, well, well, Norbit. You lose again.

1498
01:31:34.450 --> 01:31:38.318
Once a loser, always a loser, huh?
Now, come on! Let's go!

1499
01:31:39.822 --> 01:31:43.519
Yeah, I thought you'd feel
that way about it, Kate.

1500
01:31:45.027 --> 01:31:47.018
And that's why I took the liberty

1501
01:31:47.129 --> 01:31:50.724
of inviting some of
Deion's ex-wives down

1502
01:31:50.833 --> 01:31:53.199
so maybe they could tell you
for themselves.

1503
01:31:53.302 --> 01:31:54.929
Ladies!

1504
01:31:55.037 --> 01:31:56.561
Hello, Antoine.

1505
01:31:56.706 --> 01:31:59.641
-I've been looking for you.
-Daddy!

1506
01:31:59.742 --> 01:32:02.233
Antoine? He told me
his name was Luther!

1507
01:32:02.344 --> 01:32:03.311
Who is that ho?

1508
01:32:03.412 --> 01:32:05.039
He told me he was gay.

1509
01:32:05.147 --> 01:32:09.140
No, no, no. Y'all got me confused with
my gay twin brother, Antoine Luther.

1510
01:32:09.251 --> 01:32:11.742
-You dead, gold digger!
-Get your butt back here!

1511
01:32:11.854 --> 01:32:12.912

1512
01:32:13.022 --> 01:32:15.081
Looks like the wedding's off, bro.

1513
01:32:15.191 --> 01:32:16.556

1522
01:33:03.672 --> 01:33:07.039

Mind your business. Get out of here.
Move it.

1531
01:33:39.942 --> 01:33:41.705

01:34:16.545 --> 01:34:19.275
'Sputia? Rasputia?

1540
01:34:20.282 --> 01:34:22.409
You remember <i>"tilI death do us part,"</i>
