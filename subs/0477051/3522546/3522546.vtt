159
00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:23.916
Okay

160
00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:26.085
We Norbit just a little boy

161
00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:28.654
He like to all run over the place

162
00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:31.646
Making, always making

163
00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:36.226

Nobit run around the poison snake chop

167
00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:53.375
Really cross to hole

168
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.148
Norbit pass out

169
00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:58.918
I think Norbit is death, I go
to check the pulse,

170
00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:01.182
...he still alive

171
00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:05.253
Okay, I said I must do something
to save child

172
00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:07.660
I saw 2 things

173
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:15.101
Do I suck the poison out the Norbit ass
or I let him died

174
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:18.502
Well I do the most responsible things

175
00:12:18.771 --> 00:12:22.341
I said hell to the North

176
00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:24.410
No is he out of here

177
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:29.939
I teach he long time for one a
poison in another man ass

178
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:40.025
Even those poison in the
Norbit, he not died

179
00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.994
Norbit get stronger

180
00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:43.462

181
00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:48.297
That's why I know Norbit deep on inside

182
00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:53.833
But you now can survive everything

183
00:12:57.243 --> 00:13:00.346

Norbit

Norbit

397
00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:04.939
Hey Kate

398
00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:08.253
I've been looking forward

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.220
Good

400
00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.653
Hey

401
00:28:12.123 --> 00:28:13.291
Who's he?

402
00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:17.785
Norbit, this's my fiance Deion Hughes
-How are you doing, my man, sit...?

403
00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:20.191
Your fiance?

404
00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:23.902
I was telling Deion you and i were
buddies in the orphanage

405
00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:25.537
Niw she and i are buddy

406
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:27.639
shame on you, my man,
let my gal go like this

407
00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:29.266
I feel for you

408
00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.644
...has got all of the experience
in real estate

409
00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:35.204
He's gonna help me to buy the
orphanage, Norbit!

410
00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:37.248
slow down...

411
00:28:37.248 --> 00:28:39.651
I mean, we just out here just got it out

412
00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:41.753
Alrite, this's an estate

413
00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:45.211
I don't wanna make any hasty
decision that she might regret later

414
00:28:47.158 --> 00:28:48.526
...you know what i mean?

415
00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:51.062
Deion takes such a good care of me, baby

416
00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:53.656
This's my job

417
00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:03.368
Is this a lovely Tuesday?

418
00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:11.346
Why does that hurt so?

419
00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.456
Had it, boy.

420
00:29:18.456 --> 00:29:21.892
Is there an earthquake
or some other disaster?

421
00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:27.532
God!

422
00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:29.762
That is just mine...

423
00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:31.898
My wife.

424
00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:44.411
Man, this is the only space.

425
00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:56.294
Finally...

426
00:29:56.294 --> 00:29:58.421
What a cane.

427
00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:25.256
Damn it, Norbit!

428
00:30:25.256 --> 00:30:26.758
How many times I gotta tell you.

429
00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:27.959
Don't mess with my car seat.

430
00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:29.694
Nobody touch your old stupid seat.

431
00:30:29.694 --> 00:30:32.857
Then why would my car is hook up
like this thing?

432
00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:35.066
Well, you know,
you've been eating so much lately.

433
00:30:35.066 --> 00:30:37.635
And a very strong possibility that...

434
00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:39.838
The car is shrinking.

435
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:41.472
Might be shrinking the car.

436
00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:43.074
Been smaller.

437
00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:44.776
Yeah, you might be right.

438
00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:46.511
It rain a lot lately.

439
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:48.246
All this while as well.
-Oh yeah.

440
00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:51.306
That means it shrink.
-Way to go.

441
00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:59.318
I did it.

442
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.065
...hot like me.

443
00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:10.201
Don't you wish your girlfriend
was freak like me.

444
00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:13.004
Don't ya...

445
00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:14.938
That dog would be hard on me.

446
00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.639
What you doing?
-shut up!

447
00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:23.237
You gotta hit him.
-That's it now.

448
00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:29.310
stop it!
-We'll get you.

449
00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:32.517
stop. No. No.

450
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.732
I know what that sound mean.

451
00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:43.368
Bark, how you doing?

452
00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:44.892
Why?

453
00:31:45.603 --> 00:31:47.298
I get enough.

454
00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:50.674
Now where the hell do you think
you're going?

455
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:52.610
Lyod's in the hospital because of you.

456
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.779
You just want I put that little dog ass
in the hospital.

457
00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:57.382
I can put it in the mould too.
If you didn't mess with my car seat.

458
00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:59.017
And threw off my valiant skill.

459
00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:03.888
Rasputia, you are mean, selfish,
cold, heartless woman,

460
00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:05.856
And I'm leaving you.

461
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.381
You leaving me?
Yes.

462
00:32:08.626 --> 00:32:10.995
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

463
00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:13.564
You got no money, you got no family,
everything here is my name.

464
00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:15.767
The house. You got nothing to do
that will be it.

465
00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:17.869
Norbit, you can's just leave.

466
00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:21.134
Norbit, please. I'm with child.

467
00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:27.412
With child?
-Oh, yes, Norbit. Can't you tell?

468
00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:29.880
I'm getting a little belly.

469
00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:33.551
And my tit is all aching and itchy like.

470
00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:37.180
Oh, Norbit, we're gonna be
a family.

471
00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:43.122
Oh, Norbit. Come home, baby.

472
00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:50.158
Norbit...

473
00:33:04.182 --> 00:33:05.945
Hi...

474
00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:09.920
I understand with the pony.

475
00:33:10.288 --> 00:33:12.848
I know your pain.

476
00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:16.026
Oh, yes, I know.

477
00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:19.252
Excuse me, snoop bunny.

478
00:33:19.464 --> 00:33:22.558
I don't come at your jurisdiction
doing town picnics.

479
00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:25.236
You hit. He is out looking mines.

480
00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:28.506
Pimping house.
-It's just a kissing booth.

481
00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:30.008
Call me what you hear.

482
00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:34.035
But Pope sweet Jesus
is taking hate.

483
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.081
You work for me now.

484
00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:40.073
Howdy?
-sure.

485
00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:41.853
Let me taste your booth.

486
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:43.445
For the round mate.

487
00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:46.190
Greasy.
-Greasy.

488
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.885
Prepare to bings.

489
00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:52.459
I wanna be a ho.

490
00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:54.324
I know I have pride.

491
00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.263
Please let him on me.

492
00:33:58.102 --> 00:34:00.036
Let go. Let me go.

493
00:34:00.238 --> 00:34:01.500
Have fun with your buddy.

494
00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.636
Can we do with jump with?
Yeah, you go.

495
00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:05.176
Baby you know...
-There you go.

496
00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:07.078
I love you. I love you.
Your kids, your kids...

497
00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:11.014
I don't think that buying an orphanage
is the right move financially right now.

498
00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:13.584
That's all.
-Hey, this is not a financial decision.

499
00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:16.178
Do you understand that, do you baby?
-I do. I do, baby.

500
00:34:16.387 --> 00:34:19.290
But this is the call tone,
this call is very important.

501
00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:20.725
Let's talk about it when I get back.

502
00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:22.560
Okay?
You're not gonna stay?

503
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.494
No, love you. Here.

504
00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:28.229
Hello?

505
00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:31.093
It's never been a tough feet.

506
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.671
stop that.

507
00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:35.229
Norbit.

508
00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:37.998
Hey.
-Hi.

509
00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:40.278
Hey.

510
00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:42.678
I didn't know you're gonna be here.
-Oh, yeah.

511
00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:45.178
Hey, you know. I just saw Deion leaving.

512
00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:48.317
Oh, he has a business to take care of.

513
00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:53.890
so who are you here with?
-My wife.

514
00:34:57.361 --> 00:34:59.397
Norbit, I didn't know you were married.

515
00:34:59.397 --> 00:35:02.867
Hey, yeah.
-Well, that's wonderful. Really.

516
00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:06.963
Thank you... so much.
-so where is she?

517
00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:11.309
Right over there
with a print out.

518
00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:14.540
The one talking to the girl
by the bench?

519
00:35:14.712 --> 00:35:19.240
No, the one sucking this jelly
out of the fillings.

520
00:35:22.086 --> 00:35:25.180
Oh, yeah. she's pretty.

521
00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:30.450
That chill is...
-Oh, what are my kids doing? Peter!

522
00:35:30.728 --> 00:35:33.128
I don't want you bothering anyone.

523
00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:36.134
I'm so sorry. Mrs Price.

524
00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:38.369
Jesus Christ, my name is damn
as a right.

525
00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:40.605
Oh, I just thought
that you're married to Norbit.

526
00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:41.906
Who the hell are you?

527
00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:45.243
Kate, this is my wife
Rasputia Lettermore,

528
00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:48.613
And Rasputia, this is Kate.
-Nice to meet you.

529
00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:49.680
Really?

530
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.682
Kate is an old friend of mine
from the old day.

531
00:35:51.682 --> 00:35:54.519
Lettermore...
As is Lettermore Construction?

532
00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:57.788
Yeah, that's right.
As is Lettermore Construction? Why?

533
00:35:57.788 --> 00:35:59.223
Well, just, this is perfect.

534
00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:02.090
Cause I was gonna come see you guys
about a renovation of...

535
00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:05.630
I ain't talking for that.
I'm here to enjoy myself.

536
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.698
If you're talking about business,
my brother Big Black Jack...

537
00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:10.963
...will talk about it, DD girl.
Don't talk to me.

538
00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:13.327
Oh, sure. Okay.

539
00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:18.640
Okay.
-Okay.

540
00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:25.183
Come here.
-It's great, Rasputia.

541
00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:27.174
You thinking about that creepy.

542
00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:30.884
We're just friends.
-What I tell you about friends?

543
00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.257
Go and get me another Wild Cool.

544
00:36:33.257 --> 00:36:35.560
It's hot the hell out here.
Don't you see I'm shrifting?

545
00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:39.291
Rasputia, you can't just drink wine.
-Why the hell not?

546
00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:42.133
You're with child.

547
00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:47.867
With child? I would not...
Oh, that was... I had days.

548
00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:51.676
I still got it. That's attack.

549
00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:53.871
Not go get me something to drink.

550
00:36:55.379 --> 00:37:00.544
Oh, oh...

551
00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:04.143
Tramp.

552
00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:24.598
Are you Big Black Jack?
-What do I look like?

553
00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:30.248
Me and my fiance,
are buying a golden white tine.

554
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:33.718
White tine?
He sent it to you?

555
00:37:33.718 --> 00:37:36.448
Yeah. Why is that surprising?

556
00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:38.689
Miss Thomas, miss Thomas, let's go.
They started a music.

557
00:37:38.689 --> 00:37:40.057
Oh, really?
-Come on, let's go.

558
00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:42.827
Can we finish this up later?
I have to go dance now.

559
00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:45.489
Alright, baby.
You go dance now.

560
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.021
The Gordanage is in there.

561
00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:55.595
Nobody get my hat.
Get my hat.

562
00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.668
I'm gonna come on it.
I'm gonna come on in.

563
00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:12.385
Without my hat, I'm gonna take on that.

564
00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:15.126
Hey, Norbit. Come on.

565
00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.727
Oh, no, no, I can't.

566
00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:17.862
Rasputia is waiting for me.

567
00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:20.296
Come on, dance with us.
-No, really...

568
00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:24.223
Don't forget I hit a child.
I shouldn't care out for anybody.

569
00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:32.272
Half time. Piece of pain.

570
00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:41.852
Dance, Norbit, dance. Come on.

571
00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:53.631
Is spending little white women.

572
00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:55.599
My prayers have been answered.

573
00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:59.091
We better move because my prayer
is full of cat leg.

574
00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:10.972
This bad thing.

575
00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:17.421
Where the hell is Norbit
with that wine cooler?

576
00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:19.013
Hot to hell.

577
00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:30.296
Oh, hell no.

578
00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:33.967
Who knows it's right.

579
00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:37.936
That is my wine cooler.

580
00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:41.212
It's my birthday.
It's my birthday.

581
00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:43.447
What do you mean
with your birthday, huh?

582
00:39:43.447 --> 00:39:45.316
Norbit, start moving, everybody.

583
00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:47.551
Yeah.
Yeah, you loose, don't you?

584
00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:49.887

585
00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.822
I see just what you're trying to do.

586
00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:56.994
Go, Norbit. Go, Norbit. Go, Norbit.
Come on, everybody. Go, Norbit...

587
00:39:56.994 --> 00:40:03.401
Go, Norbit. Go, Norbit...

588
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:05.767
Go, Norbit!

589
00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:27.625
Hey, partner.
-Hi. Hey.

590
00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:30.116
Nice to see you. How you doing?

591
00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:33.021
I'm good. But how about you?

592
00:40:33.664 --> 00:40:35.097
Doing great.

593
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:38.436
Doctor said it's the lame from my heart
astro that killed me.

594
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.097
Oh...

595
00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:45.810
Are you sure you're okay, Norbit?

596
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.370
That sound is kind of fast.

597
00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:52.378
They're doing some testing
kind of monitoring me.

598
00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:57.054
Oh, my, I don't know about this stuff,
but 1 10 beats per minute,

599
00:40:57.054 --> 00:41:02.393
That's kind of high. 120.
Oh my Goodness, 130.

600
00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:05.885
Maybe they are hints broken.
I'm just gonna take this off.

601
00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:21.068
You Deion Hughes?
-Who's asking?

602
00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:25.082
We're the Lettermores.
Yeah. Lettermore constructions.

603
00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:26.817
Yeah, we're in this town.

604
00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:29.987
Your woman was telling us how you
always planned to buy an orphanage.

605
00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:32.122
Oh, Kate has her plan,
and I have mine.

606
00:41:32.122 --> 00:41:34.558
But it looks like
you're the plan, is to leave.

607
00:41:34.558 --> 00:41:36.494
I didn't stick around with
no damn orphan.

608
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:38.928
I got kids of my own
didn't even bringing up.

609
00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:40.731
so you were just hustling?

610
00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:42.756
Break it to agenda for me, would you?

611
00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:44.591
I'm out.

612
00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:45.970
Holing up, player.

613
00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.131
I'm thinking of this thought here.

614
00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:50.040
I don't wish you die.

615
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.344
There's a used property
outside town, zone commercail.

616
00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:56.336
You can get a liquor license.
-lnteresting.

617
00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:58.808
It's a perfect place
for titty bar.

618
00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:01.318
Did you say titty bar?
-Titties.

619
00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:05.846
We got it all worked out.
We're gonna call it Nipplopolis.

620
00:42:06.023 --> 00:42:09.823
Nipplopolis.
-so you got a rain to it, don't you?

621
00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:14.832
We're talking about overpriced water,
down alcohol, and babe tickle babes...

622
00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:18.235
In abundance. Ain't gonna be nothing
but tax free, under the table...

623
00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:20.538
...pure cash money, big time.
-That's right.

624
00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:23.474
What you gotta do?
Just bring us the deal.

625
00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:26.410
How we make you proud.
-And what about Kate?

626
00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:30.346
If you marry her,
this is much yours than hers.

627
00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:32.812
Norbit.

628
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.819
I really want you to be a part
of the orphanage.

629
00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:39.356
Th kids are crazy about you.
-They're good kids.

630
00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:43.793
Yeah. You know, I'm gonna

631
00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:45.929
Why don't you come?

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:49.028
I don't know, but...
You can go through a bike riding.

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:56.195
I knew it. I don't really know...
What, I can't driving bike. still.

634
00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:58.809
You never learn? What?

635
00:42:58.809 --> 00:43:04.509
Well, you left you know,
there's no one to teach me along to ride.

636
00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:07.918
Okay, we'll do something else.
The wild park.

637
00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.787
Kids have been begging me
to take them there.

638
00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:11.956
Oh, I don't know about that,
the water park.

639
00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:14.058

679
00:45:52.182 --> 00:45:54.810
That I didn't even thought about it.

680
00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.789
I have a question.

681
00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:01.519
Well, I'm going.
-No.

682
00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:04.194
You don't like water park, Rasputia.

683
00:46:04.194 --> 00:46:05.963
No.
-Who don't like water park?

684
00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:07.865
I love them,
just like amusement park.

685
00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:09.933
Except that I can't get on the rack
to the bathroom.

686
00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:12.128
How you know.

687
00:46:14.104 --> 00:46:15.332
Great.

690
00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:27.772
Right everybody.
Be nice to Mrs Lettermore.

691
00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:32.713
Okay.
-Kate, I hope you don't mind.

692
00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:35.759
That Rasputia is joining in.
-Of course not.

693
00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:38.159
I'm really glad that you can come.

694
00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:41.632
Well, are we gonna stand around here
all day? Are we gonna go inside?

695
00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:43.361
Excuse me.

696
00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:48.267
Excuse me, mam.
-What?

697
00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:52.476
Are you wearing bottoms?

698
00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:55.274
Of course I'm wearing bottoms.

699
00:46:56.113 --> 00:47:00.379
Okay, come on in.
-How dare you.

700
00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:08.287
Hell, no.

701
00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:26.610
You think here like real beach,
over real beach,

702
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.412
You got people walking around
with ice chills,

703
00:47:28.412 --> 00:47:32.149
And you can get all kind of treats
like sandwiches, and potato chips...

704
00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:35.786
The Nipto, the skittles,
all sort of...

705
00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.487
You can't get shit here.

706
00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:40.490
What do you know?
There is a concession stand.

707
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:44.094
You going?
-Ah, no. I already ate.

708
00:47:44.094 --> 00:47:47.497
You better fooling me.
-What? I'm sorry?

709
00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:49.233
I'm just trying to say
you're damn too skinny.

710
00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:50.934
Look at you.

711
00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:52.936
suppose to me a woman has got
a little...

712
00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:57.532
You ain't got nothing,
skinny bone, just bone skin.

713
00:47:58.275 --> 00:47:59.943
I feel sorry for you.

714
00:47:59.943 --> 00:48:03.380
Well,l just feel we were all made
exactly the way we're suppose to be.

715
00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.982
Hell, no. I'm a Christian.

716
00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:08.252
And you ain't gonna sit there
and blame God for how you look. Okay?

717
00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:10.277
You wanna push that plate away.

718
00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:12.489
And nobody is always telling me,
there's 2 kind of women.

719
00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:15.822
Big old goofers
and good old fat ass.

720
00:48:16.126 --> 00:48:17.294
Really?

721
00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:18.962
Instead just let me tell you
between the two of us,

722
00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:20.564
I can't keep Norbit off me.

723
00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:22.432
He has the biggest need if he wanted me.

724
00:48:22.432 --> 00:48:24.101
He's going not that out.

725
00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:26.370
Gonna put it on the handball everynight.

726
00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.938
Been about going on
with some little guy.

727
00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:29.940
so I can get to Macy
and look like you.

728
00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.375
Then he'll think I look disgusting.

729
00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:33.543
And I get a restless little sleep
for a while.

730
00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:35.272
Cause he want it all the time...

731
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.516
But I ain't mad at him. Hey.

732
00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:40.984
I'm a woman to die for sure.

733
00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:43.520
Next week, right now.
Right now we'll give you half the ball,

734
00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.455
And a wine cooler
how you do it?

735
00:48:45.455 --> 00:48:47.855
Where is that wine cooler section?

736
00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:51.995
Miss Thomas, we're all going after
we presume, come on.

737
00:48:51.995 --> 00:48:56.566
slowly. slowly.
You're gonna break your hand...

738
00:48:56.566 --> 00:48:58.702
slow down.
-Wait for me.

739
00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:01.939
sure it's tiring chasing
these kids all around the water park.

740
00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:05.875
Isn't it?
-Especially for a skinny boob.

741
00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:08.901
What?
-Nevermind.

742
00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:13.874
so, Norbit. I have some good news.

743
00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:18.117

You go grab some fun.
-Okay. -Okay.

Okay, kids. One at a time.

754
00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:06.666
I guess this is me.

755
00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:11.866
What are you looking at?

756
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:16.380
I was just watching the...
some kids.

757
00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.015
They are about to come down the slide...

758
00:50:18.015 --> 00:50:20.350
I want to watch the kid come down
and say...

759
00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.375

760
00:50:22.552 --> 00:50:24.955

Excuse me, ma'am.

We have a 300 pound
weight limit.

765
00:50:43.507 --> 00:50:47.110
I don't weight a damn 300 pound./l weight 165.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:48.839
And you know it.

00:50:50.313 --> 00:50:53.248
That was awesome.
-Hey.

768
00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:59.387

It's always so beautiful in here

957
01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:43.105

958
01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:44.814

You know, Kate

962
01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.814
Because it all happens so fast

963
01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:55.880

981
01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:16.303

But i'm not near you

983
01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:22.345
All i think about is being near you

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:28.250
And when you're near me i feel like
i'm in peace with the whole world

1011
01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.386

1013
01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:06.662

1014
01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:09.636
There was no date

1015
01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:12.671
I was just...

1016
01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:24.081
Oh really?

1017
01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.869

1018
01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:47.707

1019
01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:50.035
Kill the bitch

1020
01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:52.181
Excuse me, what did you say?

1021
01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:53.482
You hear me?

1022
01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:55.517
Move her out.

1023
01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:57.508
Ice the bitch

1024
01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:00.889
What are you talking?

1025
01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:04.627
Took my leg, bro, took my leg

1026
01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:07.460
No one wants to be a dog with no leg

1027
01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:12.123
And i can't even hopping

1028
01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:14.703
Hopping was my thing

1029
01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:17.331
What is this, Norbit?

1030
01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:29.573
It looks like the acid we used
down in the quarry

1031
01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:33.122
If this is miss killer's little face

1032
01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:35.750
And, Norbit, if you ever see her again

1033
01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:38.893
If you ever talk to her again

1034
01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:42.326
This is what's gonna happen to her

1035
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.636
How are you doing?

1036
01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.966
Get a picture of it?

1037
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:59.880
Deion, i just think that we need to
take a bit, it isn't you, it's me

1038
01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:02.515
Just take it slower...

1039
01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:04.682
Oh good, here you're

1040
01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:07.720
Deion, we needa talk
Yes, we do

1041
01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:10.793

1042
01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:13.694
And i found this on the big black desk

1043
01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:15.364
What is it?

1044
01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:18.765
This is a request to remove the
Gold Wanton

1045
01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:22.204
What?

1046
01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:24.640
Baby, you signed it yesterday,

1047
01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.871
No, i didn't sign anything

1048
01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:32.306
Just a permit that Norbit gave me babe

1049
01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:34.640
Did you read them?

1050
01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:36.580
No

1051
01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:41.786

1056
01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:56.171
Then you go up there and clean that

1057
01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:57.798
What happening?

1058
01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:01.574
When you build that
you didn't clean it

1059
01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:04.369
