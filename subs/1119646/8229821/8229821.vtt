00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.591
You've reached Dr. Stuart Price.

2
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:12.406
The office will be closed until the 24th.
If this is an emergency, please try...

3
00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.226
Hi. This is Dr. Stu Price.

4
00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.646
I'm getting married, so I'll be out
of the country for two weeks.

5
00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:24.568
I'm not sure if I'll have cell service.
If this is a dental emergency, plea...

6
00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:26.668
Nothing.

7
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.703
Daddy, please. You're not helping.

8
00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:38.628
I looked into his eyes.
Not the eyes of a man.

9
00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:41.026
The eyes of a coward.

10
00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.938
Excuse me.

11
00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.194
Phil.
- Tracy.

12
00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:54.765
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:56.865
Where the hell are you?

14
00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.286
It happened again.

15
00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:03.106
Don't say that.

16
00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:04.274
Please.

17
00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.527
No, this time we really fucked up.

18
00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.571
Seriously, what is wrong with you three?

19
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:12.658
So much, Trace,
I don't even know where to begin.

20
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:14.758
Oh, God. How bad?

21
00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:17.594
Like no wedding bad?

22
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.680
Yeah.

23
00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:22.852
Little worse than that.

24
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
Mm-hm.

25
00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.653
You really need to floss more.

26
00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.946
Fuck that. That's why I come here.

27
00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.532
Then you should come more than
once every two years.

28
00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:22.037
So you could bleed me of all my money?
- I never charge you a dime, Phil.

29
00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:25.248
Hey, how do I work the nitrous?
- Uh, you don't, actually.

30
00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.350
Come on. Just one hit.

31
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.713
Fillings look pretty good.
Any other problems?

32
00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:35.592
Yeah, actually.
You're getting married in Thailand.

33
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:39.721
For starters, that's flights for me and Steph.
That's two grand right there.

34
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.348
My mother-in-law's watching the kids.

35
00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.767
Now she's got this whole new thing
to hold over my head.

36
00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:45.936
Plus it takes five days to get there.

37
00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:49.606
It's a 16-hour flight.
And it's beautiful when you get there.

38
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.109
Whatever. it's a hassle.
- It is kind of far.

39
00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:54.778
Lauren's been there a week
and she's still jet-lagged.

40
00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.114
It's where her parents are from.
It means a lot.

41
00:04:57.214 --> 00:05:00.992
Who gives a shit about her parents?
Her dad hates you.

42
00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.953
He doesn't hate me.

43
00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.789
He's just never spoken to me.
I think it's a cultural thing.

44
00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.000
Why can't you get married in Vegas
like last time? So much easier.

45
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.245
Why can't you just be excited for me?

46
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.568
This is my wedding.

47
00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.138
You're really happy, huh?

48
00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:23.238
I really am.

49
00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.253
All right. I'm happy too.

50
00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:32.607
Thank you.

51
00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.707
It's gonna be fun.

52
00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:39.313
Phil? Put the prescription pad back.

53
00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.631
Thank you.
You know that's a felony, right?

54
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.731
Fuck you, man.

55
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.975
Was this right up against your scrotum?
- Yep.

56
00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:07.017
Oh, my God. I just realized.
- What?

57
00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.935
I forgot to renew my passport.

58
00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.353
Oh, no.

59
00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:14.399
Good thing I did it last week.
It's in the kitchen drawer.

60
00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:15.650
You're the best.

61
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.527
Hey, we're a team.

62
00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:22.474
No, I mean, you are a good guy.
Like, a really good guy.

63
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:24.785
Thank you.

64
00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:27.162
So I know you're not gonna get mad.

65
00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:29.472
Mad? What...? Mad at what?

66
00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:32.793
Alan found out that we're going to Thailand
for Stu's wedding.

67
00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:34.002
So?

68
00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:37.047
So he's heartbroken, Doug.
You guys are like his family.

69
00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.633
No, your family is like his family.

70
00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:44.137
All Alan talks about is the three of you.
And that weekend.

71
00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:47.224
Wait. Is he the one that keeps calling
and hanging up?

72
00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:52.187
He does that when he's upset. He doesn't
understand why he's not invited.

73
00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.272
Could you just run it by Stu?

74
00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:56.466
Just run it by him.

75
00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958
For me?

76
00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:02.072
No fucking way.

77
00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.573
Absolutely not.

78
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:06.201
Come on, Stu. it's killing him.

79
00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:07.744
I don't care.

80
00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.996
Honestly, the two of you
were barely invited.

81
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.915
Oh.
- All right. I get it. I really do.

82
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:15.418
Just, you know what? Alan considers you
to be one of his best friends.

83
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.128
I consider Alan to be insane.

84
00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.421
Stu, throw him a bone.

85
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.882
His dad pays
for everything he eats and breaks.

86
00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.760
We should squeeze the old man
to cover the bachelor party.

87
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.970
That's good.

88
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:30.183
I'm glad you brought that up,
because this is the bachelor party.

89
00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.018
What?
- What are you talking about?

90
00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.104
Yeah. it's my bachelor brunch.

91
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:40.026
Go crazy. Get some chocolate-chip
pancakes, a lap dance from the waitress.

92
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:44.239
That's bullshit. Ha, ha. You can't just
skip out of a bachelor party, Stu.

93
00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.993
You see that?
That's orange juice with a napkin on top.

94
00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:50.871
Do you know why?
So nobody roofies me.

95
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:53.832
Well, I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe
at a bachelor party.

96
00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.084
Come on.
Don't you think you're overreacting?

97
00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:58.278
No, I don't.

98
00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:03.915
I'm still putting the broken pieces
of my psyche back together.

99
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:06.094
And you know what the glue is?

100
00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:09.556
Lauren. And I'm not doing anything
to screw that up.

101
00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.851
You wouldn't be with her if it wasn't for us.
- Oh, this'll be good.

102
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.478
Stu, think about it.
You ended up ditching Melissa.

103
00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.731
Two years later,
you met your true soul mate.

104
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:22.819
You take Vegas out of that equation,
you would have married a cunt.

105
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.155
It's okay. I'm allowed to say it.
It's a bachelor party.

106
00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.781
Drink up, everybody.

107
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.743
Wait, there's no alcohol.
I forgot, we're at a fucking IHOP.

108
00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.996
Well, it's my decision and it's final,
so how about a toast?

109
00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:37.000
This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Come on, Phil. Where you going?

110
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.628
I just don't get it.
He's getting married in Thailand.

111
00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:43.048
That's great for him, but what about us?
You're just selfish.

112
00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.148
Come on, sweetheart.

113
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.026
Shame on you.

114
00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:53.308
Don't worry, Stu.
I will stand up for you no matter what.

115
00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:54.768
Thank you.

116
00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:58.778
But you gotta help me out
with this Alan thing.

117
00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.442
Guys, I can't tell you how much this means.

118
00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:06.112
Alan's been waiting for the invite
ever since he got wind of the wedding.

119
00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.322
I'm sure he has.

120
00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:10.700
Yeah, he's been standing outside
by the mailbox every day.

121
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.536
Wow, that's rough.
- Yeah. I, uh...

122
00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:18.625
I'm not quite sure he ever left Vegas,
you know? He really needs this.

123
00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.543
[KNOCKS ON Doom

124
00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.504
What?

125
00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:25.423
Sweetie, it's Pa Pa. You have visitors.

126
00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:29.323
Go in slowly,
give him a chance to acclimate.

127
00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:33.988
Hey, Alan.

128
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:36.184
Hey, guys.

129
00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.457
Hey, Phil.
- Hey, bud.

130
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.399
Uh... Uh, you guys wanna come in?

131
00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.718
Sure.
- Yeah, absolutely.

132
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.070
Hey.
- Hey.

133
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.170
Hey.

134
00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:53.252
Hey, Stu.
- Okay. See you on the court in half...

135
00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:55.996
Pretty cool room, Alan.

136
00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.707
Oh, thanks, Phil. My dad pays my rent.

137
00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:00.583
Alan, what the fuck?

138
00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:04.254
We were supposed to delete these.
You made a promise.

139
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:07.233
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell?

140
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:10.760
I'm not cool with this at all.
You can't have these.

141
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.388
Ha, ha.
- Chillax, Stu. Nobody ever comes in here.

142
00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.140
Total violation of trust.

143
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.768
Mother, I'm done with my lunch.
It's just sitting here.

144
00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.021
Sorry, honey. I'll be right up.

145
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.106
Can't believe you stopped by.
This is cool.

146
00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:25.025
Wait a second. Al, is that Mr. Chow?

147
00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.590
Yeah. We still keep in touch.

148
00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.029
Stu.

149
00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.448
The guy that kidnapped us?
- He didn't kidnap us.

150
00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.366
He kidnapped Black Doug. Remember?

151
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:37.454
It was a whole big misunderstanding.
He's actually quite charming.

152
00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:40.123
Alan, he's a criminal.
- Excuse me, boys.

153
00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.000
Hi, Linda.
- Hi, Dougie.

154
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.045
I guess we don't do dessert any more.
I didn't get that memo.

155
00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:47.881
Well, I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

156
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.106
Would a cupcake kill you?

157
00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:54.596
I don't think this was a good idea.
- Uh, Alan, we have a little surprise for you.

158
00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:58.058
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

159
00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.310
Well, only if you're not busy.

160
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.686
Stu.

161
00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.980
Well, maybe the Jonas Brothers
are in town.

162
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.025
No. They're in Raleigh-Durham
that weekend.

163
00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.735
Mm.

164
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:13.340
Are you really being serious, Stu?
You're inviting me?

165
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:19.401
Yeah, why not? Could be fun, right?

166
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.401
Phil, are you going?
- Of course.

167
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.310
Then it will be fun.

168
00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:37.016
Ah.
- Whoa, what the fuck are you doing, man?

169
00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:41.434
It's my immunizations.
This is the last day I can do it.

170
00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.020
That's supposed to be done
by a registered nurse.

171
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.815
I am a nurse. I'm just not registered.

172
00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.915
Oh, Stu, look at this.

173
00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:52.232
I bought this because I thought of you.

174
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.960
Hey, there he is.
- Hey, Stu.

175
00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:33.570
Teddy. What's up? How are you?
- Good to see you, man.

176
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.697
All right.
- Who's this guy, Stu?

177
00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.782
This is Teddy, Lauren's little brother.

178
00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:40.702
Goes to Stanford. Premed.
This is Phil, Alan and Doug.

179
00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:44.664
Hey, nice to meet you, man.
- Wow, Stanford? How old are you?

180
00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.333
I'm...
- Uh, he's 17. Kind of a genius.

181
00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:48.960
Actually, I'm 16.

182
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.505
And I'm not a genius. My dad just had me
take the entrance exams early.

183
00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.645
Because you're a genius.

184
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.261
So, what are you, a doctor?
- No. Not yet. I'm premed.

185
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:01.055
Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser?

186
00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:04.470
Yeah.
- Well, he turned out to be a gay.

187
00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:07.353
Alan.
- It's true. I read it in Teen People.

188
00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:10.648
Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna grab a book
or something for the plane.

189
00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:11.900
You guys want anything?

190
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.109
No, thanks.
- I'm good.

191
00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.111
I would actually love a Smartwater.

192
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.071
Cool.

193
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.615
Thanks.

194
00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:21.784
What’s the matter with you? He's 16.
- Yeah, Alan. Take it easy.

195
00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:24.787
I'm a little confused.
Is he here just to see us off or what?

196
00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:27.123
How does this work?
- How does what work?

197
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:30.084
Is that person coming to the wedding?

198
00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:33.963
Yes, Alan. My bride's little brother
is coming to the wedding.

199
00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.381
Is that okay with you?

200
00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:41.601
Well, it's just the first time I've heard of it.
You could have paged me.

201
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.840
Don't overreact. it's gonna be fine.

202
00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:50.330
Hey. Mind if I sit?

203
00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:54.734
Wolf pack only. Find another chair.
- There's no wolf pack, Alan.

204
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.111
Come on.
- It's no problem. I can find...

205
00:13:57.211 --> 00:14:00.949
Don't be ridiculous. You're sitting here.
- Careful. That's a Louis...

206
00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.089
That is a Louis Vuitton.

207
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.261
Thanks.

208
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.517
That's a nice neck roll.

209
00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:18.404
Thanks. You can use it if you want.

210
00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.025
Okay.

211
00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:33.684
LAUREN; Baby. Hi. on, my God.

212
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.850
Ah.

213
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:39.839
How was your trip?
- It was long, but good.

214
00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:49.954
This is so absolutely beautiful.
Thank you so much.

215
00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.267
Of course.

216
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.686
Between Teddy and me,
you must be pretty excited.

217
00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:56.439
Pretty soon you'll have two doctors
in the family. Ha, ha.

218
00:15:56.539 --> 00:16:00.735
You have to realize that in my country, we
don't consider dentist to be real doctors.

219
00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.528
Dad.

220
00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:03.738
Okay.

221
00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:07.658
Anyway, I have to go and talk to Teddy
about his cello performance tonight.

222
00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:09.758
See you.

223
00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:12.722
Ouch.
- I'm so sorry.

224
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:15.333
Your dad's kind of obsessed
with your brother.

225
00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.418
Teddy is my dad's prized possession.

226
00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:19.728
It's always been that way.

227
00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.840
He'll warm up. I promise. Okay?

228
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.885
If you just fax it over to me,
I'll pick it up from concierge.

229
00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.408
Okay. Ha, ha. Thanks, Pa Pa.

230
00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:29.639
Bye-bye.

231
00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.725
That was, uh, my dad.
I'm a stay-at-home son.

232
00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.937
We were discussing your wedding gift.
He's sparing no expense.

233
00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:39.166
Oh, that's so unnecessary.

234
00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:42.110
I've been, uh, meaning to ask.
I noticed it's a fishing village.

235
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.278
Is there a Long John Silver's on the island?

236
00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:47.281
You know, no, I don't think so.
I'm so sorry.

237
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:50.827
But we are actually sewing
some great fresh seafood.

238
00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.680
Better than Long John's'?
- Yes.

239
00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:56.165
I'll be the judge of that.
Enjoy your evening.

240
00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:59.109
You too. Okay.

241
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.474
All right.

242
00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:45.145
Thank you, Teddy.

243
00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:48.176
The hands of a brilliant musician...

244
00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.996
...and one day, a great surgeon.

245
00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:54.947
I admit it.

246
00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:59.104
When I first met Stu, I was not quite sold.

247
00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:03.090
He seemed unattractive.

248
00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:06.564
He lacked intelligence and imagination.

249
00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:11.248
He was missing that spark
you look for in a man.

250
00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:15.812
But then I look into Stu's eyes.

251
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.540
He reminded me of my sweet brother,
Chaiyo.

252
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.084
For those who do not know...

253
00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:26.689
Chaiyo is learning-disabled
and lives in a group home.

254
00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:32.203
But Chaiyo loves chok.

255
00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:35.327
And that's when I realized...

256
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.368
Stu is chok.

257
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:41.076
What's chok?

258
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.940
Chok is soft white rice in lukewarm water.

259
00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.294
It has no taste.

260
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.806
We feed it to small baby
and very old people.

261
00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:55.993
It is nourishment that everyone can digest.

262
00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:58.221
The world needs chok.

263
00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:01.787
Just as the world needs people like Stu.

264
00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:07.880
To my sweet daughter and Stu.
Congratulations.

265
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.359
Hear, hear.
- Cheers, guys.

266
00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:18.401
And now I believe that Teddy
has something to say.

267
00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:21.127
Sit down. I got this.

268
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.410
Sit down, boy.

269
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.816
That was, uh, a great speech, sir.

270
00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:31.763
I like the comparisons between, uh,
Stu and rice.

271
00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:36.684
I've also prepared a few words.

272
00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:40.788
'Hey, everybody, here are some fun facts.

273
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:43.749
The population in Thailand
is 63 million people.

274
00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:46.569
It is twice the size of Wyoming.

275
00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:50.506
Its chief exports are textiles,
footwear and rice.

276
00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:55.928
Each year, approximately 13,000 people
are killed in car accidents in Thailand.

277
00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.930
The climate in Thailand is...'
- Alan, uh...

278
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.684
Alan, why don't you skip
to the last card there, buddy?

279
00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:03.784
Okay. Sorry.

280
00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:09.525
'None of you know Stu like I do.'

281
00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:12.549
Not you. Not you.

282
00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.427
Not you. Not you.

283
00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:18.224
Not nobody knows Stu like I do.

284
00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:22.428
No one.

285
00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:25.166
'I can't even tell you
what we've been through...

286
00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:29.211
...because we made a pact
more important than blood.

287
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:31.130
What I can tell you is this:

288
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.035
This is not Stu's first marriage.

289
00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.844
There was a whore in Las Vegas
a couple of years ago...'

290
00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:40.473
All right, time's up.
You can sit down, bud. You can sit down.

291
00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:43.601
It was good. I did good, though.
- Oh, God, you killed it.

292
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:46.761
Okay. Thanks, Phil.
- Sit down. Yeah.

293
00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:57.087
In your face.

294
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:03.162
Well, that was exactly as painful
as I expected it to be.

295
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.262
Ha, ha. Sorry.

296
00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:08.584
Oh, rice pudding. What are you doing?

297
00:21:08.684 --> 00:21:12.630
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny, Phil.
- Be nice, Phil. He's extra sensitive tonight.

298
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.759
Get over it. He's your father-in-law.
He's supposed to hate you.

299
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.095
Come have a drink with me and the guys.

300
00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:23.557
You know, I'm really exhausted.
We're just gonna go upstairs and crash.

301
00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:26.477
I spoke with the manager.
He'll let us have a beach bonfire.

302
00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:28.396
That sounds fun.

303
00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:31.500
Nah. I'm good.

304
00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:32.775
He's tired.

305
00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:35.820
Stu. One drink with your friends.
They came all this way.

306
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.699
I just wanna hang out with you.
- Oh, come on, just go and do me a favor:

307
00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.018
Take Teddy with you.

308
00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:43.744
He never gets to have any fun.

309
00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:46.580
That is a great idea. Bring the kid.

310
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.624
All right. One drink.
- Perfect.

311
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:49.792
See?
- You win.

312
00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:51.460
See you later.
- Have fun.

313
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.422
Got your key?
- Uh, yep. Got it right there.

314
00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:57.922
I'll see you in 20 minutes.
- I love you.

315
00:21:59.777 --> 00:22:03.431
My Uncle Roger said
that he once saw an albino polar bear.

316
00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.474
Really? Polar bears are white.

317
00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:08.634
How would he know if it's an albino?

318
00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:11.745
This one was black.

319
00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:18.248
Did you ever think
maybe it was just a black bear?

320
00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:22.283
Whatevs.

321
00:22:22.383 --> 00:22:24.660
Okay. Here we go.
- All right.

322
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.871
American beer.
- Let's do it.

323
00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:28.497
Sealed bottles.

324
00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:30.166
Thank you. All right.

325
00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:33.169
Um, I'm not really old enough to drink.

326
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:36.881
Yeah, it's illegal.
Be a shame if somebody reported you.

327
00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:38.966
Nobody's reporting anybody.

328
00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:41.177
It's fine, Teddy. Have a little fun.

329
00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:43.277
Careful.
- What? Oh.

330
00:22:43.404 --> 00:22:46.849
What is this? Roasting marshmallows?
Nice touch.

331
00:22:46.949 --> 00:22:50.944
That was Alan's idea.
- Oh. Good thinking, Alan.

332
00:22:51.328 --> 00:22:55.775
You know, I gotta hand it to you, Stu.
This place is paradise.

333
00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:57.234
Not bad, right?

334
00:22:57.334 --> 00:23:01.489
And I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm actually jealous of you.

335
00:23:01.589 --> 00:23:03.699
I mean, Lauren is an angel.

336
00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:05.868
Yeah, she really is amazing.

337
00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:07.286
Wow, you guys are sweet.

338
00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:12.358
Not big breasts on her,
but still, solid rack for an Asian.

339
00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:14.376
Sorry, Teddy, but it's true.

340
00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:15.586
That's okay.

341
00:23:15.686 --> 00:23:21.133
That is just wildly inappropriate.
And yet I'm really glad you're here.

342
00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.052
All you guys.

343
00:23:23.152 --> 00:23:25.152
Even you, Alan.

344
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:28.057
It means a lot that you made the trip.
Thank you.

345
00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:30.017
Wouldn't miss it, buddy.

346
00:23:30.117 --> 00:23:33.562
Great. Now can we have our
one fucking beer, Dad?

347
00:23:33.662 --> 00:23:35.523
Mm-hm.

348
00:23:35.623 --> 00:23:37.024
All right. Toast.

349
00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:39.172
Come on, stand up, guys.

350
00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:41.793
Come over here, Alan.

351
00:23:43.172 --> 00:23:45.971
To Lauren and Stu.

352
00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.285
You did it, buddy.
- You sure did.

353
00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:50.385
Cheers.

354
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:09.506
What the hell?

355
00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:50.672
What?

356
00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:53.759
No.

357
00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:17.783
Phil?

358
00:26:18.327 --> 00:26:20.707
I think it's happened again.

359
00:26:21.163 --> 00:26:23.399
Alan, what the fuck did you do?

360
00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:26.644
I didn't do anything. I swear to God.

361
00:26:27.044 --> 00:26:29.263
Your hair is gone.

362
00:26:30.923 --> 00:26:32.741
No, no.

363
00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:34.841
UP...

364
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:42.146
Where the fuck are we?

365
00:26:50.776 --> 00:26:52.776
Phil, I'm scared.

366
00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:07.524
Stu, come on, get up. We got a situation.

367
00:27:14.883 --> 00:27:17.181
Oh, holy shit.

368
00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:19.886
Where are we?

369
00:27:22.015 --> 00:27:25.394
Oh, my God, Alan. Your head.

370
00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:27.769
No, your head.

371
00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:29.131
He's bald.

372
00:27:29.231 --> 00:27:32.092
Stu, you're gonna freak out,
but it's gonna be okay.

373
00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:34.386
Why? What's...? Is it my teeth?

374
00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:35.763
It's not your teeth.
- No.

375
00:27:35.863 --> 00:27:37.264
Are you sure?
- Yep.

376
00:27:37.364 --> 00:27:40.254
Did you check the bottoms?
- I did.

377
00:27:41.994 --> 00:27:43.994
Oh, my God.

378
00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:47.257
What the fuck? Ow.

379
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.487
That's good.
Why don't you try to wash it off?

380
00:27:51.587 --> 00:27:53.587
It's not coming off.

381
00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:56.850
This is a real tattoo.

382
00:27:57.467 --> 00:27:59.453
Alan, what did you do?
Did you roofie me?

383
00:27:59.553 --> 00:28:03.293
I didn't do anything.
- Stu, he swore to God.

384
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.600
What happened?

385
00:28:08.395 --> 00:28:10.631
Oh, jeez.
- What is it?. What is it?.

386
00:28:10.731 --> 00:28:13.175
Help. Back there. What are you'?.

387
00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:14.635
Did you see that jump?

388
00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:18.050
Oh, what the hell?.
- Oh, it's a monkey.

389
00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:20.766
Look at the cute little vest.
Hi, little monkey.

390
00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:22.866
Alan. Alan.

391
00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:25.452
Butthole.

392
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:28.232
Phone.
- Hi, monkey.

393
00:28:28.332 --> 00:28:31.392
Look, Alan, Alan, go find the phone.

394
00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:33.543
I got it.

395
00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:35.697
Doug. Doug. Where the hell are you?

396
00:28:35.797 --> 00:28:38.659
I'm at breakfast. By the pool.
You guys coming down or what?

397
00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:41.453
Oh, Jesus. Thank God. Doug's fine.

398
00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.872
Stu, Doug's fine. He's at the resort.

399
00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:45.707
Why aren't we at the resort?

400
00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:47.459
What's going on? Where are you?

401
00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:51.130
I don't know, man. We woke up
in some shithole room in some city.

402
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.483
Oh, God. What city?

403
00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:56.879
I don't know, Doug. Fucking Asia Town.

404
00:28:57.152 --> 00:28:59.277
I don't know. I told you.

405
00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:01.056
Where are we?

406
00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:03.156
I have no fucking idea.

407
00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:08.497
Hey, Stu.
- What?

408
00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:11.081
Check this out.

409
00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:15.056
You ever seen anything like this?

410
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.854
What is that?
- Careful.

411
00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:28.417
Might be a spider's nest.
I've tangled with those before.

412
00:29:28.517 --> 00:29:32.296
I don't get it, man. I mean,
we each had one beer last night, right?

413
00:29:32.396 --> 00:29:35.382
I mean, you too.
- Yeah, but I left early, remember?

414
00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:37.092
I don't remember shit.

415
00:29:37.192 --> 00:29:40.095
Tracy wasn't feeling well.
She came down to get me.

416
00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:42.055
Wait a second. Is Teddy with you guys?

417
00:29:42.155 --> 00:29:44.391
Teddy? What?
What are you talking about?

418
00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:46.935
They've been looking for him all morning.

419
00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:50.230
Teddy went to Stanford, right?
- Yeah. Why?

420
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.330
Fuck.

421
00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:55.402
I just found his finger.

422
00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:57.502
What?

423
00:29:57.546 --> 00:30:00.115
I just found his fucking finger, Doug.

424
00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:02.215
Phil, what is going on?

425
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:05.287
All right. All right, all right, all right.

426
00:30:05.387 --> 00:30:08.123
This is what we're gonna do.
Tell the girls that we woke up early...

427
00:30:08.223 --> 00:30:10.292
...and went on a fishing trip.
That's where we are.

428
00:30:10.392 --> 00:30:13.537
Right.
- All right, stay by the phone.

429
00:30:14.187 --> 00:30:16.187
Shit.

430
00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:22.807
All right, we got a little bit of a problem.

431
00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:24.946
What is that?

432
00:30:25.574 --> 00:30:27.574
We don't know.

433
00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:29.995
Is it a worm?

434
00:30:30.287 --> 00:30:32.381
It's a mushroom.

435
00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:35.915
Yeah, shiitake.

436
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.863
Monkey, taste it. What do you think?
Is it shiitake?

437
00:30:39.963 --> 00:30:42.003
He can't understand you.

438
00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:44.424
He just did.

439
00:30:44.551 --> 00:30:45.827
Why is he pulling on it?

440
00:30:45.927 --> 00:30:47.621
He's probably hungry.

441
00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:49.748
Wait a second. Is that...?

442
00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:52.772
Aah. What the fuck, man?.

443
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:55.295
Tell that gay monkey to leave my shit alone.

444
00:30:55.395 --> 00:30:57.395
Chow'?.

445
00:30:57.439 --> 00:30:59.439
You fucking crazy.

446
00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.177
Ah, so fucking light in here.

447
00:31:02.277 --> 00:31:03.845
Alan.

448
00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:05.639
Grab me my sunglasses.

449
00:31:05.739 --> 00:31:10.686
It's great to see you, Leslie.
- Mm. Nice to see you too, my little hobo.

450
00:31:10.786 --> 00:31:12.771
Chow, what the fuck are you doing here?

451
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:16.608
Alan called me a few days ago
and invited me to wedding.

452
00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:18.944
Excuse me?
- What? He's my plus one.

453
00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:21.196
You didn't have a plus one.
It's $200 a plate.

454
00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:24.700
Guys, guys. Just focus, okay?
Chow, what happened?

455
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.815
You guys texted me, said you fucked up
and looking to party.

456
00:31:35.477 --> 00:31:38.797
I picked you up in my boat
and I brought you here to Bangkok.

457
00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:40.924
And we had a sick night, bitches.

458
00:31:41.024 --> 00:31:44.386
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second, Chow.

459
00:31:44.486 --> 00:31:46.305
Chow, we're in Bangkok?

460
00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:50.126
Holler. City of squalor.

461
00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:51.685
Do you know how I got this tattoo?

462
00:31:51.785 --> 00:31:55.130
Uh, yeah. From a fucking tattoo guy.

463
00:31:55.288 --> 00:31:57.858
Come on, Stewie.
Use that big Jewish brain.

464
00:31:57.958 --> 00:32:00.593
Hey, what's the monkey holding?

465
00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.114
That's a finger.

466
00:32:04.214 --> 00:32:06.433
Stu, I got some bad news.

467
00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:09.807
Teddy was with us last night.

468
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.455
That's his finger.

469
00:32:11.555 --> 00:32:13.978
Teddy... Teddy's dead?

470
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:18.253
Ha, ha. Teddy not dead.
He party with us all night.

471
00:32:18.353 --> 00:32:19.588
Well, then where is he?

472
00:32:19.688 --> 00:32:22.068
Don't you remember anything?

473
00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:24.860
No.
- No. Nothing, Chow.

474
00:32:25.026 --> 00:32:28.001
Okay, okay. I explain it all, okay?

475
00:32:28.572 --> 00:32:30.766
Just let me do one bump,
get my head straight.

476
00:32:30.866 --> 00:32:32.868
Come to papa.

477
00:32:33.452 --> 00:32:36.046
Okay.
- That's a big...

478
00:32:41.418 --> 00:32:45.173
You ready for craziest fucking story of...

479
00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:57.348
Chow.

480
00:32:58.894 --> 00:33:00.894
Mr. Chow, are you okay?

481
00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:05.696
You gotta be kidding me.

482
00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:13.531
Fuck, he's dead.

483
00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:20.565
Help.
- Stu.

484
00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:23.009
Help. Help.
- Stu, shut up.

485
00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:25.463
Stu, shut up. Stu, shut up.

486
00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:27.572
Call an ambulance.
- Shut up.

487
00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:31.743
He's dead. Look, if someone comes and
finds a dead body and a pile of cocaine...

488
00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:34.830
...we'll spend the rest of our lives
in a Thai prison. Shh.

489
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.565
Alan. Alan, please stop crying.

490
00:33:39.434 --> 00:33:44.619
All right. All right.
I just need a second to figure this out.

491
00:34:17.847 --> 00:34:21.710
This is the worst idea ever.
What the fuck is this place?

492
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:25.589
'Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
Its population is 12 million people.'

493
00:34:25.689 --> 00:34:28.579
Alan, put the cards away and help.

494
00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:35.515
Elevator.

495
00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:39.100
I'll get the button. I'll get the button.

496
00:34:40.495 --> 00:34:42.689
What the fuck is the deal with this monkey?

497
00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:44.837
That monkey gets it.

498
00:34:45.709 --> 00:34:47.986
Come on.
- Oh, fuck. No, the power's out.

499
00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:50.989
We gotta take the stairs.
- Ah, fuck.

500
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:53.089
Come on.

501
00:34:57.429 --> 00:34:59.429
Here it is.

502
00:34:59.889 --> 00:35:03.799
Feet first, feet first. I've done this before.

503
00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:06.269
Alan.

504
00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.862
All right. Careful. Careful.

505
00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:32.839
Stu.
- What?

506
00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:37.035
We still have to find Teddy.

507
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:39.135
Oh, God.

508
00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:48.588
The roof.

509
00:35:48.688 --> 00:35:49.881
Teddy.
- Teddy.

510
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:54.202
Teddy. Teddy.
- Teddy. Teddy.

511
00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:57.403
ALAN, Teddy.

512
00:36:00.075 --> 00:36:02.749
You guys see anything?
- No.

513
00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:09.339
Come on. Where are you, buddy?

514
00:36:12.087 --> 00:36:14.087
He's not here.

515
00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:19.449
I can't believe this is happening again.

516
00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:26.001
Okay. Look, we'll handle this.
You get back there.

517
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:29.671
You tell them that Alan and I
got drunk with him, we're still partying.

518
00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:32.048
You gotta go get married.
- No, no.

519
00:36:32.148 --> 00:36:34.843
I'm not going back without Teddy.

520
00:36:34.943 --> 00:36:39.448
It's Lauren's little brother,
he's lost, he's injured.

521
00:36:39.614 --> 00:36:41.867
If I fuck this up...

522
00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:44.661
I lose everything.

523
00:36:47.163 --> 00:36:49.163
Okay.

524
00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:51.958
All right.

525
00:36:52.585 --> 00:36:54.883
Alan, check your pockets.

526
00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:56.531
What?
- You know the drill.

527
00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:58.867
Come on, there might be clues.

528
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:02.996
Check your phones. Numbers, texts.
- Oh, that's a good idea.

529
00:37:03.096 --> 00:37:04.789
I got nothing. Fuck.
- Me neither.

530
00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.875
I got a text from Chow.
- What time?

531
00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:08.977
Uh, 10:00 last night.

532
00:37:09.144 --> 00:37:10.712
What's it say?

533
00:37:10.812 --> 00:37:13.531
'On my way, niggas.'

534
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:14.883
Oh, niggas. Okay.

535
00:37:14.983 --> 00:37:16.983
Hip-hop.

536
00:37:19.112 --> 00:37:22.992
We are so fucked.

537
00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:26.332
Hey, Phil.
- What?

538
00:37:26.494 --> 00:37:28.494
Look who's back. Hi.

539
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:33.068
We gotta get you out of the sun.
Get you a hat.

540
00:37:33.168 --> 00:37:35.168
Yeah. Yeah.

541
00:37:35.795 --> 00:37:38.865
Phil, I really think we should go
to the American Consulate.

542
00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:41.785
For what? Report a dead body
we shoved into an ice machine?

543
00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:44.913
Are we gonna keep walking in circles?
That's real productive.

544
00:37:45.013 --> 00:37:47.874
I'm trying to figure this out.
Your attitude is not helping.

545
00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:51.169
Well, I'm sorry. It's 100 degrees
and we don't have a plan.

546
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:53.421
And all we've done is buy him hats
and sodas.

547
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:54.923
What? it's a bag of Fanta.

548
00:37:55.023 --> 00:37:57.676
All right, what do you wanna do, Stu?
- I don't know.

549
00:37:57.776 --> 00:38:01.596
Then stop yelling at me like it's my fault.
- It is your fault.

550
00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:03.431
All I wanted was a bachelor brunch.

551
00:38:03.531 --> 00:38:05.892
Shit. Shut up, it's Doug. Talk to me.

552
00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:09.104
Just got off the phone with Bangkok P.D.
They got him. He's okay.

553
00:38:09.204 --> 00:38:12.378
Oh. Thank God. Doug found him.

554
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.275
What happened?
- He got arrested.

555
00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:17.278
Arrested? For what?
- Disorderly conduct.

556
00:38:17.378 --> 00:38:19.614
Seriously?
- Yeah. He's okay, though.

557
00:38:19.714 --> 00:38:23.326
They'll release him to you, no questions
asked. No one here has to know.

558
00:38:23.426 --> 00:38:25.474
He's at the, uh...

559
00:38:26.638 --> 00:38:28.873
'Ratchawang Police Station.'

560
00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.292
Okay. Okay,
I'll call you when we get there.

561
00:38:31.392 --> 00:38:36.832
Teddy's in jail, but fine. We gotta get a cab.
- Okay. All right.

562
00:38:40.401 --> 00:38:42.971
Yes, I have his paperwork here.
- Okay.

563
00:38:43.071 --> 00:38:45.140
He has been cleared.
- Sounds good.

564
00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.100
Of course.
- Thank you.

565
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.354
We're good, we're good.
They're processing for release.

566
00:38:51.454 --> 00:38:53.857
Yeah, they threw him in the drunk tank.
He's fine.

567
00:38:53.957 --> 00:38:58.445
Sixteen years old, spent a night in jail.
Can you imagine?

568
00:38:58.545 --> 00:39:00.545
We love to party.

569
00:39:04.217 --> 00:39:06.217
Here we go.

570
00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:09.164
Wait, who's this fucking guy?
- Teddy Srisai.

571
00:39:09.264 --> 00:39:10.832
What...? No, no, no. I'm so...

572
00:39:10.932 --> 00:39:12.625
It's the wrong guy. Sir.

573
00:39:12.725 --> 00:39:14.836
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Uh, there's been a mistake.

574
00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:17.672
He brought the wrong guy.
That's not Teddy.

575
00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:21.767
Of course it is.
We have his IDs and everything.

576
00:39:21.985 --> 00:39:24.345
These were in his pockets
when we made the arrest.

577
00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:26.485
They were in his pocket?

578
00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:28.850
Excuse me, sir.

579
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.245
How did you get this stuff?

580
00:39:32.453 --> 00:39:34.453
Hello?

581
00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:35.940
Teddy doesn't speak.

582
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.440
We tried English, Thai, Chinese.
Nothing.

583
00:39:39.544 --> 00:39:41.029
Let me ask you something.

584
00:39:41.129 --> 00:39:46.367
Does he look like he works out at
Bally Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?

585
00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:49.311
Look, we arrest a lot of people.

586
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.707
We cannot analyze everything. All right?

587
00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:55.043
Well, what do you expect us to do
with this guy?

588
00:39:55.143 --> 00:39:57.143
Not my problem.

589
00:39:57.687 --> 00:39:59.687
Hey, guys?

590
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:01.549
I think he knows us.

591
00:40:01.649 --> 00:40:03.649
Hi. Hello.

592
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:11.309
Do you know where our friend is?.
Teddy. He's missing.

593
00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:13.561
Stu, forget it. The guy's worthless.

594
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:17.996
He knows something.
He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.

595
00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:19.859
What if he just doesn't understand?

596
00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:23.954
Uh, I'll act it out.
Yeah, like charades. Watch.

597
00:40:24.505 --> 00:40:26.715
Two words.
- Is it a movie?

598
00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:29.185
This is not for you, Alan.

599
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:34.349
American teenager in Asia.

600
00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:36.895
Karate Kid with Jaden Smith.

601
00:40:37.352 --> 00:40:39.963
It's easy because
you were talking through it.

602
00:40:40.063 --> 00:40:41.673
Stu, it's a waste of time.

603
00:40:41.773 --> 00:40:43.758
Just leave this fucking guy here.

604
00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:47.679
Oh, here's something.'There are
500,000 monks living in Thailand.

605
00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:51.933
It is not uncommon for some monks
to take a vow of silence...

606
00:40:52.033 --> 00:40:55.378
...at the age of 8.'
- There you go.

607
00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:59.649
Is there anything else in that envelope?
- No, it's empty.

608
00:40:59.749 --> 00:41:00.900
Whoa, hang on.

609
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.471
A drink card from White Lion Bar,
Bangkok?

610
00:41:06.047 --> 00:41:08.141
Worth a shot.

611
00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:12.912
Jesus Christ. Is this the right street?

612
00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:15.012
That's what it says.

613
00:41:19.894 --> 00:41:24.132
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is the White Lion.

614
00:41:24.232 --> 00:41:25.967
What the fuck happened here?

615
00:41:26.067 --> 00:41:28.411
Holy shit.

616
00:41:33.241 --> 00:41:39.106
Oh, okay. Just keep walking. Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah, we should probably...

617
00:41:40.415 --> 00:41:42.483
Ah.
- All right. it's okay.

618
00:41:42.583 --> 00:41:45.218
What the fuck is going on here?

619
00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:49.324
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, check it out.

620
00:41:49.424 --> 00:41:52.678
Holy shit. Stu, look.

621
00:41:52.844 --> 00:41:54.329
That's my face.

622
00:41:54.429 --> 00:41:56.429
Go, go, go.

623
00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:58.681
Nice work, Alan.

624
00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:03.021
Hello?
- Be with you in a minute.

625
00:42:07.108 --> 00:42:08.760
Excuse me.

626
00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.860
Oh, look who it is.

627
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.070
So, what do you think?

628
00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.432
What? I'm sorry?

629
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:16.572
The tattoo? You love it?

630
00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:19.604
Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.

631
00:42:19.704 --> 00:42:21.856
No refunds. Get the fuck out.

632
00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:24.506
Wait a second.
- Read the sign.

633
00:42:25.793 --> 00:42:28.696
We don't want a refund.
We just have a couple of questions.

634
00:42:28.796 --> 00:42:30.990
Trying to figure out
what went down last night.

635
00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.450
'What went down'?

636
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.328
Look what you did outside.
Half the neighborhood went down.

637
00:42:35.428 --> 00:42:36.537
We did that?

638
00:42:36.637 --> 00:42:39.707
You don't remember getting into a bar fight
at the White Lion?

639
00:42:39.807 --> 00:42:41.626
Starting a full-on fucking riot?

640
00:42:41.726 --> 00:42:45.230
No, sir. We don't remember anything.

641
00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:52.703
Hold this. Oh, boy.

642
00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:55.404
Check this out.

643
00:42:59.494 --> 00:43:01.494
Holy shit.

644
00:43:04.457 --> 00:43:06.585
Fuck the police.

645
00:43:06.751 --> 00:43:08.751
Fuck the police.

646
00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:14.431
There's Teddy. He was with us.

647
00:43:27.897 --> 00:43:29.465
Jesus Christ.

648
00:43:29.565 --> 00:43:32.552
That's when the cops arrived,
started cracking skulls.

649
00:43:32.652 --> 00:43:35.346
I took you guys
and hid you in the shop here.

650
00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:39.726
Then you decided to get a tattoo.
Cried like a little bitch.

651
00:43:39.826 --> 00:43:43.104
This kid's fucking 9 years old.
He's got balls twice your size.

652
00:43:43.204 --> 00:43:47.275
Show him your balls, man.
- No, no, no. That's okay.

653
00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:50.695
Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy.
Have you seen him?

654
00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:52.572
Not since last night. What happened?

655
00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:56.784
Yeah, I'm supposed to marry his sister
tomorrow and we kind of lost him.

656
00:43:56.884 --> 00:43:59.728
Oh, well. Then fuck it.

657
00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:02.267
What do you mean, 'fuck it'?

658
00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:06.294
Bangkok has him now
and she'll never let him go.

659
00:44:06.394 --> 00:44:08.129
You hear that? Huh?

660
00:44:08.229 --> 00:44:10.256
Is this what you wanted? Happy now?
- Phil.

661
00:44:10.356 --> 00:44:14.218
You're wasting your time.
These monks take their vow shit seriously.

662
00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.553
Look at this.

663
00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:19.307
That's the sign of the Chiang Mei
monastery just outside of town.

664
00:44:19.407 --> 00:44:23.232
Maybe somebody over there
can get him to talk.

665
00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:30.276
Can we just go over this one more time?
You got the beer from...?

666
00:44:30.376 --> 00:44:32.653
The hotel bar.
They gave me a sealed case.

667
00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:35.782
Right. But who gave it to you?
- The bartender.

668
00:44:35.882 --> 00:44:37.492
Right. Okay.

669
00:44:37.592 --> 00:44:39.827
And then you brought them out
and I opened them.

670
00:44:39.927 --> 00:44:43.664
Yeah, and Doug had one and he was fine,
so it's not the beer.

671
00:44:43.764 --> 00:44:45.917
So, what the hell happened?
- I have no idea.

672
00:44:46.017 --> 00:44:49.087
Hey, guys. Check it out,
he's got a Chinese boner.

673
00:44:49.187 --> 00:44:51.440
Alan, come on. Cut it out.

674
00:44:55.026 --> 00:44:56.928
The monkey is a pervert.

675
00:44:57.028 --> 00:44:58.971
Come on, that is so wrong.

676
00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:02.386
Hey, don't stop, monkey, keep doing it.

677
00:45:09.457 --> 00:45:14.557
When a monkey nibbles on a penis,
it's funny in any language.

678
00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:17.546
Oh, keep doing it.

679
00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:21.143
All right. Thank you.

680
00:45:21.302 --> 00:45:23.302
We good?

681
00:45:23.638 --> 00:45:26.858
Bye, Shannon. Bye, Lil Wayne.

682
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.400
Wow.

683
00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:40.655
So beautiful.

684
00:45:42.448 --> 00:45:44.913
What is this, a P.F. Chang's?

685
00:45:46.327 --> 00:45:48.705
Ah, they're meditating.

686
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.629
Such a peaceful people.
- Yeah.

687
00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:54.527
Knock, knock. Hello?.

688
00:45:54.627 --> 00:45:58.072
Alan, Alan, show some respect.
Don't get up, guys.

689
00:45:58.172 --> 00:46:00.491
We brought one of your guys back.

690
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:03.911
He's really funny.
He's really nice and cool.

691
00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:08.091
Hi, how you doing?
Uh, are you the one in charge?

692
00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:11.022
Hey. Aah.
- Excuse me. Ow.

693
00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:12.503
Wait. Ah.
- stop in

694
00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:14.422
Just calm down. Aah.

695
00:46:14.522 --> 00:46:15.673
Hold on. Ah.

696
00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:18.217
It's because' Ow. We're talking. Ah.

697
00:46:18.317 --> 00:46:20.490
Stop talking. Goddamn it.

698
00:46:20.653 --> 00:46:22.054
Don't. Stop.

699
00:46:22.154 --> 00:46:23.431
Wait. it's me.

700
00:46:23.531 --> 00:46:24.724
Stop hitting me.

701
00:46:24.824 --> 00:46:26.824
Oh, I get it.

702
00:46:30.204 --> 00:46:32.204
No talk. No talk.

703
00:46:32.331 --> 00:46:35.551
Shh. Okay. We no talk.

704
00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:40.656
Okay.

705
00:46:40.756 --> 00:46:43.221
Asshole.
- I get it, I get it.

706
00:47:01.569 --> 00:47:06.414
Late last night, you climbed the walls
of our monastery...

707
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:12.355
...shouting out question about love,
marriage and the meaning of life.

708
00:47:13.873 --> 00:47:19.237
Poor Brother Han was meditating alone
in the garden and you took him.

709
00:47:19.337 --> 00:47:21.840
Oh, my God.

710
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.340
We kidnapped a monk.

711
00:47:24.633 --> 00:47:26.911
Uh, we live an alternative lifestyle.

712
00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:31.999
And we are so sorry about that,
but we weren't ourselves last night.

713
00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:34.835
Yup, things kind of spun out
of control a little bit.

714
00:47:34.935 --> 00:47:38.940
But there's a boy who's missing and hurt.

715
00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:41.676
Can you find out if he knows
where our friend is?

716
00:47:41.776 --> 00:47:44.971
Brother Han took a vow of silence
many years ago.

717
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:47.139
It would be useless to try.

718
00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:51.686
Well, maybe he can write down
what happened on a piece of paper.

719
00:47:51.786 --> 00:47:54.522
Actually, that would be cheating.
Right, Grand Wizard?

720
00:47:54.622 --> 00:47:57.466
Alan.
- I'm afraid Fatty is right.

721
00:47:57.625 --> 00:47:59.627
See? What?

722
00:47:59.794 --> 00:48:03.281
None us will ever know what
Brother Han knows.

723
00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:04.699
Oh, all right.

724
00:48:04.799 --> 00:48:07.994
So much for holy people.
Bunch of bald assholes. Come on, let's go.

725
00:48:08.094 --> 00:48:11.872
Hey, you know what? FYI, you may wanna
put some signs up that say 'no talking'...

726
00:48:11.972 --> 00:48:14.875
...before you unleash your dragon.
- Yeah, that was a little rough.

727
00:48:14.975 --> 00:48:19.297
You're welcome for bringing him back safe.
You know, we found him in a drunk tank.

728
00:48:19.397 --> 00:48:21.173
We did take him in the first place.

729
00:48:21.273 --> 00:48:23.313
Come on, guys, let's go.

730
00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:25.901
Wait.

731
00:48:26.195 --> 00:48:28.055
The Buddha teach:

732
00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:31.625
Every memory lives somewhere
deep within.

733
00:48:32.034 --> 00:48:36.981
Perhaps you should bring your question
to the garden of meditation.

734
00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:39.608
Did you understand a word he said?
- About two-thirds.

735
00:48:39.708 --> 00:48:41.736
Something about the garden of meditation?

736
00:48:41.836 --> 00:48:45.239
No, he said he's farting
because of his medication.

737
00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:47.339
I get that.

738
00:48:52.054 --> 00:48:55.750
This is a waste of time.
I don't remember anything.

739
00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:57.376
Do you?

740
00:48:57.476 --> 00:49:00.104
No. I got nothing.

741
00:49:01.105 --> 00:49:03.105
Alan?

742
00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:07.067
Alan?

743
00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:12.767
Every memory lives somewhere
deep within.

744
00:49:12.867 --> 00:49:14.867
Sweetie?
- What?

745
00:49:14.869 --> 00:49:16.604
You have visitors.

746
00:49:16.704 --> 00:49:18.704
Hey, Alan.
- Hey, guys.

747
00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:20.441
Hey, Phil.
- Hey, buddy.

748
00:49:20.541 --> 00:49:24.570
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.
- Is this true, Stuart?

749
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.050
Yeah, why not? it'll be fun.

750
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.730
What the fuck?
- To Lauren and Stu.

751
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.260
Cheers.

752
00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:37.865
Chow?
- We had a sick night, bitches.

753
00:49:38.392 --> 00:49:40.895
Yeah.
- Alan, what the fuck?

754
00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:44.131
Is that person coming to the wedding?

755
00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:45.674
There is no wolf pack.

756
00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:48.511
Alan, don't do that.
- 'The population in Thailand is...'

757
00:49:48.611 --> 00:49:53.286
And we're the three best friends
That anybody could have

758
00:49:57.328 --> 00:49:59.328
Hey.

759
00:50:00.706 --> 00:50:04.085
Yeah. Fuck the police. Fuck the police.

760
00:50:16.388 --> 00:50:18.388
I know where to go.

761
00:50:20.935 --> 00:50:22.975
What do you think, Alan?

762
00:50:23.103 --> 00:50:25.105
Uh, this is the place.

763
00:50:25.272 --> 00:50:27.272
Come on, let's go.

764
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.199
I don't remember any of this.

765
00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.851
Yeah, Alan,
are you sure this is the place?

766
00:50:36.951 --> 00:50:38.953
Yeah, pretty sure.

767
00:50:46.293 --> 00:50:48.387
Bros, finally.

768
00:50:48.546 --> 00:50:51.574
Is he coming or what?
I've been waiting all day for him.

769
00:50:51.674 --> 00:50:53.701
Uh, I'm sorry. Waiting for who?

770
00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:55.926
Chow, that dick-ass fuck.

771
00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:59.373
Why, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

772
00:50:59.473 --> 00:51:01.333
Okay, good. Look at this.

773
00:51:01.433 --> 00:51:04.712
Look what I bring for him.
Check it out, huh? Huh?

774
00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:07.486
No, no, no.
- $6000, American.

775
00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:09.742
Wow, it looks so real.

776
00:51:15.781 --> 00:51:18.079
Sorry. Ahem. Sorry.

777
00:51:18.242 --> 00:51:19.810
Alan. What the fuck?.

778
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:23.731
It's okay. it's okay.
The gun, very sensitive. Very sensitive.

779
00:51:23.831 --> 00:51:25.733
Everybody okay?
- Yeah, okay.

780
00:51:25.833 --> 00:51:29.087
Okay? Then get the fuck back to work.

781
00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:31.253
Come on. Music, please.

782
00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:33.365
Who has my $6000?

783
00:51:33.465 --> 00:51:37.328
No, no, no. That's Chow's deal.
We got nothing to do with that.

784
00:51:37.428 --> 00:51:39.246
Un-fucking-believable, man.

785
00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:43.459
This guy, if he backs out again,
this shit is gonna catch up to him, okay?

786
00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:46.921
He's made a lot of enemies in this town
and now they're your enemies.

787
00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:48.214
That's not fair.

788
00:51:48.314 --> 00:51:51.050
Okay, listen.
We're just looking for a little kid.

789
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:52.927
Two thousand dollars.
- What?.

790
00:51:53.027 --> 00:51:55.930
I don't know. Maybe more.
How young you want this kid to be?

791
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:59.099
No. No, no, no. Sorry.
You misunderstood.

792
00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:03.545
We're looking for our friend,
16 years old, Teddy?

793
00:52:03.704 --> 00:52:06.440
Teddy?
Yeah, he was here with you guys last night.

794
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.526
He was?
You remember if he left with us?

795
00:52:08.626 --> 00:52:12.238
You were in the corner all night
with Kimmy. I didn't see you leave.

796
00:52:12.338 --> 00:52:14.240
Kimmy? Kimmy? Is she here?

797
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:18.118
Yeah, she's in the back.
She just came for her shift. Go talk to her.

798
00:52:18.218 --> 00:52:20.829
Listen, I'm sorry about everything
that happened.

799
00:52:20.929 --> 00:52:23.165
Pay attention what
I'm gonna talk to you now.

800
00:52:23.265 --> 00:52:27.520
When you see Chow,
you tell him Samir says hello.

801
00:52:27.686 --> 00:52:29.713
Okay.
- But do it like that, okay?

802
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:31.853
Hello. Like threatening.

803
00:52:31.899 --> 00:52:33.467
Like ironic.

804
00:52:33.567 --> 00:52:35.567
Hello.
- Okay.

805
00:52:37.363 --> 00:52:39.661
Hello.
- Hello.

806
00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:42.201
Hello.
- More O. Hello.

807
00:52:42.368 --> 00:52:43.477
Hello.

808
00:52:43.577 --> 00:52:46.480
Go away, go away.
Fucking make me crazy.

809
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:50.442
Of course I remember him.
He was buying shots for everyone.

810
00:52:50.542 --> 00:52:53.921
Nice kid. His parents must be so proud.

811
00:52:54.088 --> 00:52:56.088
Yeah. You have no idea.

812
00:52:56.173 --> 00:52:58.242
Okay, so do you remember
if he left with us?

813
00:52:58.342 --> 00:53:02.788
Yeah, you all were leaving together,
but you almost forgot this one right here.

814
00:53:02.888 --> 00:53:05.311
Right, superstar?
- Hmm.

815
00:53:05.474 --> 00:53:09.920
This one was following me around
like a little puppy dog all night.

816
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:14.950
Saying how he fall in love with me
and ask me to marry him.

817
00:53:15.609 --> 00:53:17.609
Classic Stu.

818
00:53:17.945 --> 00:53:20.764
We didn't get married, did we?
- Of course not.

819
00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:23.225
We just had some fun
in the Chardonnay Room.

820
00:53:23.325 --> 00:53:25.603
What, uh... What happens
in the Chardonnay Room?

821
00:53:25.703 --> 00:53:27.688
Let's just stay on task here.

822
00:53:27.788 --> 00:53:30.691
Oh, you know. Dance for him.
He tickle me. We had sex.

823
00:53:30.791 --> 00:53:32.985
I massage his shoulders.
- Fuck.

824
00:53:33.085 --> 00:53:35.529
It's okay. You're not married yet.
It's no big deal.

825
00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:37.757
It's cheating, okay?

826
00:53:37.923 --> 00:53:42.286
No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.
It's a violation of my moral code.

827
00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:45.060
Don't be sad. Stu, you love it.

828
00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:47.958
You were crying,
saying how special it was.

829
00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:50.044
Wait. Ha, ha. I'm sorry, he was crying?

830
00:53:50.144 --> 00:53:51.545
What a baby. He was crying.

831
00:53:51.645 --> 00:53:56.342
You should have seen him.
He was so sexy, the way he move around.

832
00:53:56.442 --> 00:54:01.542
I had to ask him slow down
so I don't drop my load too quick.

833
00:54:01.989 --> 00:54:03.989
Load? What load?

834
00:54:03.991 --> 00:54:06.665
Oh, you know. My sperms.

835
00:54:07.995 --> 00:54:12.650
Eh, I think your English is off.
You're talking about my sperms.

836
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:14.360
Where would your sperm come from?

837
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.903
From my balls.

838
00:54:16.003 --> 00:54:17.363
Hold on. Back up.

839
00:54:17.463 --> 00:54:20.012
Wait, wait. Are you...?

840
00:54:20.174 --> 00:54:22.643
Hey. You in Bangkok, sweetie.

841
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:24.912
There's a reason
they don't call it Bangcunt.

842
00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:27.012
Oh.

843
00:54:30.851 --> 00:54:32.851
Oh, my God.

844
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:35.270
Wow.

845
00:54:36.356 --> 00:54:39.501
I don't get it. Is this a magic show?

846
00:54:39.777 --> 00:54:44.877
Come on, Stu. It was beautiful.
We climaxed at the same time.

847
00:54:44.907 --> 00:54:46.517
How's that work?

848
00:54:46.617 --> 00:54:49.770
Shoot my load into you,
you shoot your load on the floor.

849
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:52.590
Okay.
- You shot your load in me?

850
00:54:52.706 --> 00:54:54.706
In my bottom?

851
00:54:55.209 --> 00:54:57.209
Oh, God.

852
00:55:04.343 --> 00:55:07.121
Stu, it's not the end of the world.

853
00:55:07.221 --> 00:55:09.941
I'm sorry, but I am so confused.

854
00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:13.739
I made love to a man with boobies.

855
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:17.631
Listen, I promise you no one's ever
gonna find out about this.

856
00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:19.299
But we just found out about it.

857
00:55:19.399 --> 00:55:21.760
And then we forget. That's what we do.

858
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.805
I've done so much fucked up shit,
and I just forget about it.

859
00:55:24.905 --> 00:55:28.900
You have?
- Yeah. You just forget. It goes away.

860
00:55:29.743 --> 00:55:32.813
That might be harder to go away,
but in time it'll happen.

861
00:55:32.913 --> 00:55:35.038
That's what I'm gonna do.

862
00:55:35.541 --> 00:55:37.151
I'm just gonna forget about it.

863
00:55:37.251 --> 00:55:39.251
Never happened.
- Right.

864
00:55:40.379 --> 00:55:42.823
Phone. Phone. Who is it? Answer.

865
00:55:42.923 --> 00:55:44.491
Lauren's dad.

866
00:55:44.591 --> 00:55:45.951
It just reminded me.

867
00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:47.661
Answer it.
- I can't.

868
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:50.581
He might know something about Teddy.
We still have a shot.

869
00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:55.016
I can't.
- Get your head back into the fucking game.

870
00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:01.675
Hello?
- Who takes an all-day fishing trip...

871
00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:03.635
...the day before a wedding?

872
00:56:03.735 --> 00:56:07.139
Yeah, ha, ha.
I guess it was kind of stupid.

873
00:56:07.239 --> 00:56:09.239
Put Teddy on the phone.

874
00:56:09.741 --> 00:56:13.871
Uh, Teddy's seasick, actually.
- Seasick?

875
00:56:14.037 --> 00:56:16.774
Teddy's been a maritime deck cadet
since he was 9.

876
00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:19.359
Well, that's weird,
because he's puking everywhere.

877
00:56:19.459 --> 00:56:22.613
I'm gonna tell you something
that you did not know.

878
00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:24.156
I don't like you.

879
00:56:24.256 --> 00:56:26.992
Yeah, I knew that already.
- My daughter chooses you...

880
00:56:27.092 --> 00:56:29.161
...that's her problem.
- Hey, it's Phil Winnick.

881
00:56:29.261 --> 00:56:35.000
Listen, I apologize. We've been reeling in
some crazy marlin, and I just want...

882
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.210
Phil.
- Phil.

883
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:37.377
Jesus.

884
00:56:37.477 --> 00:56:39.630
Phil? You're okay.
- Fuck me.

885
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.048
Give us back our monkey.

886
00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:43.091
What monkey? Get your own monkey.

887
00:56:43.191 --> 00:56:45.886
Come on, you asshole.
The fucking monkey.

888
00:56:45.986 --> 00:56:47.387
Come on.

889
00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:49.681
Any time, Alan. He's pointing a gun at us.

890
00:56:49.781 --> 00:56:51.183
This is our monkey.

891
00:56:51.283 --> 00:56:54.978
Alan, no one's getting shot over
a fucking monkey. Hand him over now.

892
00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:58.478
Oh, God, I never get to keep no monkeys.

893
00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:05.280
Hey, check it out.
He's got a banana on his helmet.

894
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.741
These guys are the real deal.
- What's happening?

895
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:10.911
Hold on. How did this happen?
Do you know where our friend is?

896
00:57:11.011 --> 00:57:15.006
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, 16 years old, Asian kid?

897
00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:18.418
No, I don't understand what he said.

898
00:57:18.518 --> 00:57:20.671
What did he say? What did he say?.

899
00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:24.001
He said, 'Fuck you and your question.'

900
00:57:25.317 --> 00:57:26.760
Oh, my arm.

901
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.410
Poor Phil. Phil, are you okay?

902
00:57:29.529 --> 00:57:33.409
Oh, I got shot. Fuck. Fuck, guys.

903
00:57:33.575 --> 00:57:37.938
It's all right, Phil. We'll figure this all out
and get the monkey back. I promise.

904
00:57:38.038 --> 00:57:40.065
No one gives a fuck
about the monkey, Alan.

905
00:57:40.165 --> 00:57:42.384
Oh, shit, look at my arm.

906
00:57:42.542 --> 00:57:45.386
What the fuck is going on?.

907
00:57:45.545 --> 00:57:48.198
Stu, am I gonna be okay?
You're a doctor.

908
00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:51.613
I don't know. Let me look, let me look.

909
00:57:52.552 --> 00:57:54.288
What? What?

910
00:57:54.388 --> 00:57:55.956
Stu, come here. No, look at it.

911
00:57:56.056 --> 00:57:59.293
Stuart Price, get your ass back over here.

912
00:57:59.393 --> 00:58:01.393
You got shot.
- I know.

913
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:19.459
Hey.
- Yo. You all right?

914
00:58:19.621 --> 00:58:21.440
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

915
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:26.137
Actually, bullet just grazed my arm.
Eight stitches.

916
00:58:26.628 --> 00:58:28.822
Only cost $6. How's that even possible?

917
00:58:28.922 --> 00:58:31.721
How's any of this even possible?

918
00:58:35.137 --> 00:58:39.557
I mean, if I was a foot to my left,
Stu, I'd be dead.

919
00:58:40.767 --> 00:58:42.767
What are we gonna do?

920
00:58:47.649 --> 00:58:51.474
I'm sorry, guys.
This wasn't part of the plan.

921
00:58:51.987 --> 00:58:53.987
What plan, Alan?

922
00:58:55.073 --> 00:58:57.368
I've said too much already.

923
00:59:04.791 --> 00:59:07.795
Alan, what plan?

924
00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:11.198
This is all Teddy's fault.

925
00:59:11.298 --> 00:59:12.866
What are you talking about, Alan?

926
00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:15.202
Why is he here?
He's not part of the wolf pack.

927
00:59:15.302 --> 00:59:18.146
Alan, what did you do?

928
00:59:18.305 --> 00:59:23.043
It's not my fault. Teddy shouldn't have
been sharing from his bag.

929
00:59:23.143 --> 00:59:24.294
What bag?

930
00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:27.547
The marshmallows.
I had a separate bag just for Teddy.

931
00:59:27.647 --> 00:59:31.218
But it was dark, it was hard to keep track,
and then you almost sat on them.

932
00:59:31.318 --> 00:59:33.720
I couldn't tell which was which.
It was mayhem.

933
00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:36.181
What did you do to the marshmallows,
Alan?

934
00:59:36.281 --> 00:59:38.784
Alan? What did you do?

935
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:42.771
Well, isn't it obvious?
I spiked them with muscle relaxers.

936
00:59:42.871 --> 00:59:45.232
And, plus, my ADHD medication.

937
00:59:45.332 --> 00:59:47.359
What?.
- You drugged us again?.

938
00:59:47.459 --> 00:59:51.196
Not you. I just wanted to knock out Teddy
so we could enjoy the weekend.

939
00:59:51.296 --> 00:59:56.034
'Enjoy the weekend''? Alan, you told me
that you didn't do anything.

940
00:59:56.134 --> 00:59:57.869
Alan, you swore to God.

941
00:59:57.969 --> 01:00:00.288
I just wanted things to stay the same.

942
01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:02.561
Look at my face.

943
01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:04.849
You ruined my life.

944
01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:06.003
You're not my friend.

945
01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:08.922
Don't say that, Phil. Are you serious?
Even in America?

946
01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:12.868
Yes.
- Oh, God. Don't say that, Phil.

947
01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.428
Don't start crying, Alan.

948
01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.096
You're the bearded devil.

949
01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:19.641
You liked it. You smiled at me when
I held up the marshmallows.

950
01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:23.736
Because I like marshmallows,
you fucking psycho.

951
01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:27.341
Hey. Whoa, whoa, hold on. Stop.

952
01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:29.109
Guys, guys. Enough.
- Why?.

953
01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:31.382
Why, Alan?. Why?.

954
01:00:31.837 --> 01:00:34.614
Because we're the three best friends,
remember?

955
01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.283
Remember?

956
01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:39.557
Stu, that's enough. That's enough.

957
01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:41.719
Fuck.

958
01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:47.354
Guys, we can't fall apart now.
We gotta stick together.

959
01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:55.651
Alan, what's that written on your belly?
- What? Huh?

960
01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:59.639
'Lebua Hotel. Saturday, 6 p.m.'
Did you write that?

961
01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:01.739
No.

962
01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:05.079
Shit, that's in 20 minutes.

963
01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:07.230
What about England?
Are we friends there?

964
01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.649
I told you,
it was in the heat of the moment.

965
01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:12.819
We're still friends, all over the world.

966
01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:15.724
Even Great Britain?
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

967
01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:19.801
Well, what about you, Stu?

968
01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:22.468
We'll see.

969
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.682
Gentlemen, follow me.

970
01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:30.768
All right.

971
01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:41.905
Here you go.

972
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.700
Well.

973
01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.588
It's about time. Sit down.

974
01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:50.982
Come on, sit, sit, sit.
- Okay.

975
01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:53.547
Wow, you guys look like shit.

976
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.550
Uh, do we know you?
- Hey.

977
01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:04.155
Take off your fucking hat.
You're in a restaurant, for chrissake.

978
01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:09.709
Okay, listen. Uh,
we have no clue what's going on here.

979
01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:14.005
You know, they sell a plum whiskey here.
It's fucking unreal.

980
01:02:14.105 --> 01:02:17.675
Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up.

981
01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:22.764
Oh, I'm sorry, you guys already
got fucked up, didn't you?

982
01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:25.851
Uh, listen. I'm a little confused.
How did you...?

983
01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:28.562
Yeah, you know what?
I'm a little fucking confused.

984
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.230
Where's Chow?.

985
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:36.195
Where is Chow with the fucking account
code and the fucking password?.

986
01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:47.467
We don't know anything about any codes.
We're just trying to find our friend.

987
01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:52.106
Teddy.
- Yes. Teddy.

988
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:54.269
Have you seen him?

989
01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:56.423
Come here.

990
01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:59.777
Hmm. Let's see. Oh.

991
01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:02.568
There's Teddy.

992
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:06.659
Holy shit. it's from last night.
- Hmm.

993
01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:09.686
Who are you?

994
01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.146
I'm a businessman...

995
01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:15.525
...and I have invested a large chunk
of capital in your friend Chow.

996
01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:19.362
And in return, he was supposed
to transfer our profits electronically...

997
01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:22.807
...about five fucking minutes ago.

998
01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:27.350
So last night,
we took Teddy as insurance.

999
01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:30.686
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

1000
01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:33.989
Oh, my God. I wasn't done talking.

1001
01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.644
You tell Chow...

1002
01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:41.384
...that we are having breakfast on the roof
of this hotel tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.

1003
01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.803
Now, if he makes the transfer,
you will get Teddy.

1004
01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:47.999
If not, well, then, hey, you know?
It's Bangkok.

1005
01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:53.941
That's your cue to get the fuck out of here.

1006
01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:01.934
Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.

1007
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.589
Alan, leave the hat.

1008
01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.092
Attaboy.

1009
01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:20.840
We're fucked. Chow's dead.
What do we do now?

1010
01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:26.972
The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow.
This whole thing's about a bank account.

1011
01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:29.516
Let's just go back to the hotel,
Search Chow's body.

1012
01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:32.811
And hopefully the password's
in his wallet or something.

1013
01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:35.355
What if it isn't?
I mean, they're gonna kill Teddy.

1014
01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:40.385
Just relax. We have until 8 a.m.
tomorrow to figure it out.

1015
01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:45.348
First the monkey, now my hat.

1016
01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:48.352
How much worse can this day get?

1017
01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.811
Jesus Christ.

1018
01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:05.619
Well, we're living here in Alantown

1019
01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:11.326
And he's driven our lives into the ground

1020
01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:16.208
When we woke up
We were wasted and drunk

1021
01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:18.544
Phil got shot

1022
01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:22.586
We got beaten by a monk

1023
01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:28.725
I was happy, and my life was good

1024
01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:34.189
Getting married like a dentist should

1025
01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:38.318
Roasting marshmallows on a stick

1026
01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:41.355
I got fucked in the ass

1027
01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:44.240
By a girl with a dick

1028
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:47.903
I remember that.

1029
01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:54.456
And we 're living here in Alantown

1030
01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.911
There's water everywhere.

1031
01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:02.025
Yeah, that's because it melted, Stu.
The fucking power's out.

1032
01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:05.195
'With an inadequate electrical grid
serving millions of people...

1033
01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:08.281
Bangkok experiences
1500 power outages per year.'

1034
01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.617
Seriously, Alan, that's enough.

1035
01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:12.717
Out of the way.

1036
01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:20.725
We got it.

1037
01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:24.312
Ghost. There's a ghost.

1038
01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:27.571
Motherfucker.

1039
01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:31.534
Chow, calm down. Chow, calm down.

1040
01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:34.798
Fucking kill on me.
- No, no, no. Ah.

1041
01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.327
It's okay.

1042
01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:41.871
Relax.

1043
01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:46.006
Shh.
- Shh.

1044
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:53.435
That's it. it's just us. Breathe.

1045
01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:55.912
Chow so cold.
- I'm gonna warm you up.

1046
01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:58.606
Chow so cold. Chow so cold.

1047
01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:01.167
You did good, buddy. You did good.

1048
01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.267
Chow did good.

1049
01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.024
Feeling better?

1050
01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:12.387
You all right? You warm enough?

1051
01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:15.223
I don't know.
Come feel my balls and tell me.

1052
01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:19.102
I've been locked in a fucking ice box all day.

1053
01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:22.856
Hey, Alan, you want my awesome
sunglasses, you just ask Chow.

1054
01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:24.691
You don't have to kill me.

1055
01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:28.820
Chow, nobody killed you. You were
already dead. You didn't have a pulse.

1056
01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.738
Oh, you never do blow before?

1057
01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:34.701
Sometime your heart stop, start up again.
Read a book.

1058
01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.703
Look, I'm sorry.
We're just having a bad day.

1059
01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:40.148
Oh, you having a bad day? Did you die?

1060
01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:42.208
I got shot.

1061
01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:43.877
But did you die?

1062
01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:48.089
Chow, some guy told us that
you've got a bank code or something...

1063
01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:52.802
...and if we don't bring it to him first thing
in the morning, he's gonna kill Teddy.

1064
01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:55.826
Who, Kingsley? Pfft. He harmless.

1065
01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:59.414
Don't worry. I got the bank codes.

1066
01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:03.146
Great. All right,
we gotta meet him at 8 a.m.

1067
01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:05.023
Who is that fucking guy, anyway?

1068
01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:07.123
Invest in my business.

1069
01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:08.610
Yeah? What business is that?

1070
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:11.884
It's called Not Your Business, okay?

1071
01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:14.338
So where's the monkey?

1072
01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:15.909
The monkey?
- Yeah.

1073
01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:21.619
I stashed the account number
and password in his vest. Where is he?

1074
01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:25.877
Why would you do that?
- Safekeeping, pretty boy.

1075
01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:28.087
I got a lot of heat on my ass.

1076
01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:33.284
I got FBI, Bangkok P.D.,
Interpol, MSNBC.

1077
01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:36.095
That monkey snorting coke
with me all night...

1078
01:08:36.195 --> 01:08:39.224
...jerking me off while
I watch Stu fuck with ladyboy.

1079
01:08:39.324 --> 01:08:41.392
Ugh.
- He not going anywhere.

1080
01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:43.102
We don't have the monkey, Chow.

1081
01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:46.064
No, some Russian thugs took him from us.

1082
01:08:46.164 --> 01:08:48.164
Oh, you fucking guys.

1083
01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:51.042
Okay, no problem.

1084
01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.592
We just have to get him back.

1085
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:57.115
From where?
- Same place we took him from.

1086
01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:20.882
This monkey isn't just normal monkey.

1087
01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:36.431
Think of him like monkey drug mule.

1088
01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:40.389
He take coke to buyer...

1089
01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.164
...and deliver cash to dealer.

1090
01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:47.264
He middleman.

1091
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.240
Dealer never handle drug directly.

1092
01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:52.353
He clean.

1093
01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:54.966
That's terrible.

1094
01:09:55.066 --> 01:09:58.344
Not terrible. What you talking about?
It's fucking genius.

1095
01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:01.163
You ever see monkey go to jail?

1096
01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:04.642
We just signal monkey for deal,
he come close...

1097
01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:07.312
...we take his vest and that's that.

1098
01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:09.856
Maybe get some blow too.
You know, just bump.

1099
01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:11.996
No. No more bumps, Chow.

1100
01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:16.043
Okay, this is ridiculous.

1101
01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:21.742
Stu, Mr. Chow can't whistle.
Signal monkey.

1102
01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.782
All right, here we go.
- Come on.

1103
01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:42.680
How'd we wind up with the monkey
last night?

1104
01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:48.730
Well, I needed some blow and
Alan thought he was cute, so we stole him.

1105
01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:00.657
So stupid.

1106
01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.325
Stu, ready to grab vest?

1107
01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.474
I... Okay. I just grab it?

1108
01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:08.331
Yeah, just do it, Stu. Just do it.
- Hey, monkey.

1109
01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:10.431
Alan, shh.
- Hi.

1110
01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.734
Fuck.
- We gotta go right now.

1111
01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:18.883
Pull that fucking monkey in.

1112
01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:20.983
I'm trying.

1113
01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.113
Aah. Fuck.

1114
01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:31.270
Get that monkey in here, Stu.

1115
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:33.623
He won't let go.

1116
01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:36.526
Stu, get back in the car right now.

1117
01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:39.630
I'm trying. Slow down.

1118
01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.134
He's so strong.

1119
01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:52.434
Let go, you fucking monkey.

1120
01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:55.128
Look out.
- Aah.

1121
01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:57.268
Oh, shit. Tight squeeze.

1122
01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:02.361
I got him. I got him.

1123
01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:08.607
Where's the code, Chow?
- Check his little vest.

1124
01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:13.062
You got it, Alan?
- Yeah, I got it, Phil.

1125
01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:17.157
Slow down, slow down, Chow.
- Hold on, gay boys.

1126
01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.253
Holy shit.
- Fuck.

1127
01:12:23.548 --> 01:12:26.013
Don't worry, I got this shit.

1128
01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.760
Pig.

1129
01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.292
Oh, my word.

1130
01:12:34.392 --> 01:12:36.687
Ha, ha. Sorry, Stu. My bad.

1131
01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.191
Oh, shit.

1132
01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:46.012
Get down.

1133
01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:48.112
What the fuck?.

1134
01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:51.459
Oh, no. They shot the monkey.

1135
01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:54.326
They shot the monkey.

1136
01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:56.453
I'm at my wits' end.

1137
01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.998
He's coming back around.

1138
01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:03.794
Look out.

1139
01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:09.264
Holy fuck.
- Oh, no.

1140
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:31.325
Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

1141
01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:35.412
Whoo. I have such an erection right now.

1142
01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:41.373
Are you for real?

1143
01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:46.656
Shh.

1144
01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:50.181
It's okay. it's okay. it's okay.

1145
01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.094
It's okay.

1146
01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:59.424
They're gonna take good care
of you here, okay?

1147
01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:02.353
What's that?

1148
01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.008
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1149
01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:09.848
Cigarettes, got them right here.
Here you go.

1150
01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:15.324
There you go.

1151
01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:20.001
Deep breath.

1152
01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:21.941
Good. Good.

1153
01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:24.544
Smoke it in.

1154
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:27.280
Breathe the smoke
into your tiny little lungs.

1155
01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.198
There you go.

1156
01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:33.208
It's funny. I've never been
much of a smoker...

1157
01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:35.538
...but, boy, does it look cool on you.

1158
01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:38.141
Alan. Come on, let's go.

1159
01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:43.897
I'm gonna miss you, monkey.

1160
01:14:46.357 --> 01:14:48.735
I wish monkeys could Skype.

1161
01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:52.403
Maybe one day.

1162
01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:02.440
Come on, get in.
- Scoot over.

1163
01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:06.790
Oh, we gotta go see Kingsley.
- He's gonna be fine.

1164
01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:23.861
If I could save time in a bottle

1165
01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:28.775
The first thing that I'd like to do

1166
01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:32.153
Is to save every day

1167
01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:36.036
Till eternity passes away

1168
01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.225
Just to spend them with you

1169
01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:40.227
Are you guys seriously this calm?

1170
01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:43.147
Relax, Stuart. It's classic switcheroo.

1171
01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:45.441
I give him money, he gives us Teddy.

1172
01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.985
Ever do anything that doesn't
end up in a standoff?

1173
01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:51.405
I'm an international criminal.
It always ends like this.

1174
01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:54.533
I met my wife at one of these things.

1175
01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:56.035
You have a wife?

1176
01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:58.433
Yeah. We married 15 years.

1177
01:15:58.596 --> 01:16:02.336
What, Chow not good-looking enough
for woman?

1178
01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.391
No, that's cool.

1179
01:16:05.853 --> 01:16:07.755
Let's do this.
- Welcome to the Tower Club.

1180
01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:10.529
Blah, blah, blah. Who cares?

1181
01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:14.115
it's okay.
- Stop. Chow crossing.

1182
01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:19.225
Hey, Kingsley.

1183
01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:22.300
Well, well.
- Propecia looking nice.

1184
01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:24.897
Whew, you been hitting the gym?

1185
01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:28.234
Yes, I am, actually.
Thank you for noticing, Chow.

1186
01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:30.712
Hey, guys, have a seat.

1187
01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:32.238
Where's Teddy?

1188
01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:35.074
He's waiting downstairs in my car.
We'll send him up...

1189
01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:37.743
...when the transfer is complete.
- Tell you what:

1190
01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:43.708
Give me extra 50 grand, you keep Teddy.
And I throw in this other fat fuck for free.

1191
01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:45.808
Oh, jeez. Chow.

1192
01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.712
Can we move this along?

1193
01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:50.156
Alan, account number?

1194
01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:52.299
Come On, Come On, Come On.

1195
01:16:52.399 --> 01:16:56.654
Uh, eight-one-four...

1196
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.530
K, as in 'knife'...

1197
01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:02.292
...two-three-nine-eight.

1198
01:17:03.702 --> 01:17:04.937
Password?

1199
01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:07.037
'Baloney1

1200
01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:08.482
Your password is 'baloney1'?

1201
01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:11.902
It used to be just 'baloney.'
Now they make you add number.

1202
01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:15.381
Really fucking annoying. Okay.

1203
01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:27.477
And it's that easy.
- Ta-da.

1204
01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:30.990
Oh, look, you sunk my battleship.

1205
01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:34.133
Great. Now can we please have Teddy?

1206
01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:37.032
Uh, yeah. Bring him up.

1207
01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:38.804
Good to go.

1208
01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:42.975
Ha, ha. See? We go to your
wedding, we have fun, I bust a nut.

1209
01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:46.079
We did it, Stu. it's over.

1210
01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:58.067
This is Bangkok Police.
Everybody down.

1211
01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:03.930
No. Kingsley, you're fucking 5-0?

1212
01:18:04.305 --> 01:18:05.664
Gotcha, Leslie.

1213
01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:06.999
Get him out of here.

1214
01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.394
Go. Good, good. We're good.

1215
01:18:13.772 --> 01:18:15.772
How the fuck...?.

1216
01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.858
Samir?

1217
01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:21.782
You fucked me over 6 grand?
You camel jockey.

1218
01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:24.266
You spit to me?

1219
01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.018
You spit to me?

1220
01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:28.354
Hey, 6 grand this time, 8 grand last time.

1221
01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:30.648
It's not the money, man.
It's the principle.

1222
01:18:30.748 --> 01:18:33.692
Principle? Nigga, please.
We both dead inside.

1223
01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:35.861
You call me nigga?
Huh? Don't call me nigga.

1224
01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:40.699
Toodleoo, motherfucker.
- Called me nigga. Racist asshole, man.

1225
01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:43.327
You guys okay?
- What the fuck's going on?

1226
01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.371
Detective Inspector Peters, Interpol.

1227
01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:47.206
You're a cop?
- Yes.

1228
01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:49.792
This sting operation's been in place
for weeks.

1229
01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:53.379
When Samir told us
that your friend was lost...

1230
01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.464
...we took advantage of that information.

1231
01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:58.158
I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

1232
01:18:58.317 --> 01:19:02.179
So can Teddy come out of the car now?
- No, Alan, Teddy's not in the fucking car.

1233
01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:04.849
They don't have him.
They never had him.

1234
01:19:04.949 --> 01:19:07.434
They just needed us to bring them Chow.

1235
01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:09.574
They used Teddy as bait.

1236
01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:12.189
Do you have any leads at all?

1237
01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:16.610
No. We've checked everywhere,
no one has seen him. I'm sorry.

1238
01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:19.446
If you haven't found him by now...

1239
01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:22.095
I'm afraid Bangkok has him.

1240
01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:29.266
Why do people keep saying that?

1241
01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:33.308
Stu...

1242
01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:35.686
...it's time.

1243
01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:42.276
Phil.

1244
01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.611
I'm sorry.

1245
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.158
Don't say that. Please.

1246
01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:49.476
No, this time we really fucked up.

1247
01:19:49.576 --> 01:19:51.576
Oh, God. How bad?

1248
01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:53.662
Like no wedding bad?

1249
01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:55.706
Yeah.

1250
01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:57.927
Little worse than that.

1251
01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:04.931
I don't know what to tell you.

1252
01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:25.804
Okay, how about this?

1253
01:20:25.904 --> 01:20:29.389
He fell off the fishing boat and drowned.

1254
01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:31.533
No.

1255
01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:33.646
Okay, I got it.

1256
01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:35.874
Teddy was hit by a truck.

1257
01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:39.109
Alan.
- Not a good time, Phil. Kind of busy.

1258
01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:41.111
How many people get run over here?

1259
01:20:41.211 --> 01:20:43.591
Ugh. Over 1200 a year, Phil.

1260
01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:46.825
Perfect.
His body was too mangled to recover.

1261
01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:48.925
Case closed.

1262
01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:52.183
Can I have more ice, please?

1263
01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:54.124
I'm not gonna lie to Lauren.

1264
01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:57.398
Stu, do you want this or not?

1265
01:20:57.728 --> 01:21:00.231
Look at what I've done, Phil.

1266
01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:02.658
What I do.

1267
01:21:05.069 --> 01:21:07.959
I have a weakness for prostitutes.

1268
01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.155
All kinds, apparently.

1269
01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:17.214
I have a demon in me.

1270
01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.207
So what?

1271
01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:25.781
Teddy's gone, but I can still save Lauren.
I'll just let her live her life without me.

1272
01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:26.991
Stu.

1273
01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:30.744
I want you to call Doug and tell him
I'm never coming back.

1274
01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:33.734
I'm getting off the hamster wheel.

1275
01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:36.625
I'm gonna stay here in Bangkok.

1276
01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:38.853
I think I belong here.

1277
01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:41.739
Open up a little dentist office.

1278
01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:45.624
Teeth cleanings with a happy ending.

1279
01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:50.987
You sure about this?

1280
01:21:57.955 --> 01:22:00.253
Hey. What the crud?

1281
01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.917
Power's out, Alan.

1282
01:22:07.631 --> 01:22:09.325
Phil.
- Doug.

1283
01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:10.743
I need answers, man.

1284
01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:13.412
I know, um...
- Doug, who are you talking to?

1285
01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:15.706
Give me the phone.
- No, that's a private...

1286
01:22:15.806 --> 01:22:17.583
Who is this?
- Lauren?

1287
01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:20.919
Phil? Tell me what's going on right now.

1288
01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:22.963
We lost your little brother.

1289
01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:24.173
What?

1290
01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.696
Bangkok has him now.

1291
01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.601
We gotta take the stairs.

1292
01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:37.701
You're in Bangkok?

1293
01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:44.381
Ew. That's a finger.

1294
01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:46.543
Put Stu on the phone.

1295
01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:50.407
'Bangkok experiences
1500 power outages per year.'

1296
01:22:50.507 --> 01:22:53.327
Stu really just doesn't wanna
talk to anybody.

1297
01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:54.703
Water.
- Power's out.

1298
01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:57.790
Come on, Stewie.
Use that big Jewish brain.

1299
01:22:57.890 --> 01:23:00.143
He's just not up for it...

1300
01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:02.795
Phil? Phil. Phil, give me the phone.
- it's Lauren.

1301
01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:07.049
I know. I need to talk to her.
- I'm handling this. I'll handle this, Stu.

1302
01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:09.927
You're gonna break her heart.
- Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

1303
01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:11.136
I'm so sorry.

1304
01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:14.890
Stu? What the hell is going on?
What does he mean, you lost Teddy?

1305
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:17.101
What? Is that what Phil said?

1306
01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:19.836
No, no, no. We misplaced Teddy.

1307
01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:24.149
But we're all good now. We're headed back
to the resort. See you soon.

1308
01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:25.818
I love you so much.

1309
01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:29.843
And I gotta go, but I'll see you soon. Bye.

1310
01:23:32.424 --> 01:23:34.424
Stu.

1311
01:23:36.803 --> 01:23:38.803
Stu....
- Ah.

1312
01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:42.355
Taxi. Taxi.

1313
01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:45.943
Come on. Come on, Alan. Come on.

1314
01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.550
Hey, you mind filling us in?
- Okay.

1315
01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:50.869
Now, when we woke up,
the power was out.

1316
01:23:50.969 --> 01:23:51.969
Yeah.

1317
01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:54.513
And you found Teddy's finger in what?

1318
01:23:54.613 --> 01:23:57.850
In a bowl of water.
- But it didn't start out as water.

1319
01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.602
It was ice.
- Exactly. Teddy got ice from the machine...

1320
01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:03.564
...came back to the room,
put his finger on ice, fell asleep.

1321
01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:07.109
What do you do if you wake up
and your finger's in a bowl of melted ice?

1322
01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:11.029
I'd get more ice, Stu,
on the 15th fucking floor.

1323
01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:14.283
Yes.
Teddy goes up, the power goes out...

1324
01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:17.512
Holy shit. Of course.

1325
01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:19.496
Of course, he's in the ice machine.

1326
01:24:19.596 --> 01:24:21.644
Alan, no.

1327
01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:26.628
It's on 10.

1328
01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:29.023
Sir, is the elevator stuck?

1329
01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:31.988
Come on.
- Go. Go, go, go.

1330
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.555
Ten. This is it. Teddy.

1331
01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:37.973
Teddy. Teddy.

1332
01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.073
Look out, look out.

1333
01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:50.844
Oh, my God. Teddy.
- He's okay. He's okay.

1334
01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:52.863
Hey, you okay?

1335
01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:54.740
You okay, man?

1336
01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:55.908
Where am I?

1337
01:24:56.008 --> 01:24:58.243
You're in an elevator in the middle
of Bangkok.

1338
01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.746
But we're gonna get you out of here.
It's gonna be fine.

1339
01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:02.414
Hey, Stu...

1340
01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:04.514
...nice tattoo.

1341
01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:08.378
Thanks, man.
- All right, let's do this.

1342
01:25:08.478 --> 01:25:10.005
Come on. Come on, come on.

1343
01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:12.858
Doug, we found him. Yeah.

1344
01:25:13.025 --> 01:25:16.762
I know, I know, but we're on our way.
Okay, bye.

1345
01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:20.265
All right, guests are arriving,
people are starting to ask questions...

1346
01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:22.434
...but we can still pull this off.

1347
01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:24.853
How?
- I don't know. Like, a taxi?

1348
01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:26.688
Chow's speedboat.
- What?

1349
01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:29.399
Last thing I remember was getting
off Chow's speedboat.

1350
01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:31.360
Chow has a speedboat?

1351
01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.460
The Perfect Life.

1352
01:25:34.004 --> 01:25:36.004
Come on.

1353
01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:41.144
Stu, get that back line.

1354
01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:44.763
Good jump, Phil.

1355
01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:48.642
You all right?
- Yeah.

1356
01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:51.880
You sure you know how to drive this thing?

1357
01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:56.910
Please. I was raised in yacht clubs.
I know what I'm doing.

1358
01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:19.884
You know where we're going?

1359
01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:22.160
Please address me as 'captain.'

1360
01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.763
Oh, fuck you, Alan.

1361
01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:29.568
Do you know where We're going,
captain?

1362
01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:35.132
Affirmative, cadet. We're going south,
through the Gulf of Thailand. Ha, ha.

1363
01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:37.232
Good.

1364
01:26:57.671 --> 01:27:00.971
Hey. You okay?

1365
01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:04.943
Feeling a little better.
- All right.

1366
01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:11.043
Listen, Teddy, I'm really sorry.
We didn't mean for any of this to happen.

1367
01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:15.023
It's funny. I can't remember anything...

1368
01:27:15.188 --> 01:27:18.317
...but when I woke up...

1369
01:27:18.734 --> 01:27:20.734
I was kind of happy.

1370
01:27:21.278 --> 01:27:23.278
Yeah.

1371
01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:27.726
By the way, you have any idea
where my finger is?

1372
01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:31.396
Yeah, we gave it to a drug-dealing monkey.

1373
01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:35.901
Bangkok.

1374
01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:38.001
Yeah, right?

1375
01:27:38.003 --> 01:27:40.003
Fucking Bangkok.

1376
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:50.248
He's on his way, I'm telling you.
Dad's always doing this.

1377
01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:52.348
No, it's just...

1378
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:55.629
I apologize. There will be no wedding.

1379
01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:58.215
No, he is on his way. He will be here.

1380
01:27:58.315 --> 01:28:01.009
Please, if you will all move to the bar.

1381
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:04.509
We are going to clear this area. Please.

1382
01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:07.057
Daddy, how can you do this?

1383
01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:10.897
I'm telling you, I spoke to him.
He's coming.

1384
01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:13.605
You don't understand.

1385
01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:16.174
Look. There they are.

1386
01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:22.128
Stu.

1387
01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:29.246
Alan, there's no dock.

1388
01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:30.455
Just hang on.

1389
01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:32.874
Alan, it's not funny. Turn the boat.
- Hang on.

1390
01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:34.710
Is that Alan driving the boat?

1391
01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:36.461
What? Uh...

1392
01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:39.881
We should probably move back a little bit.
Come on.

1393
01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:41.425
Alan, slow down.
- Please.

1394
01:28:41.525 --> 01:28:44.386
Turn the boat. Turn the boat, Alan.
Turn the fucking boat.

1395
01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:46.221
Everyone, back up a little bit here.

1396
01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:49.725
Sir, it's gonna get worse
before it gets better. Come on, sir.

1397
01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:51.825
Hold on. Hold on.

1398
01:29:00.752 --> 01:29:02.752
Fuck.

1399
01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:06.575
Hi.

1400
01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:08.675
Hi, everybody.

1401
01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:12.539
We came in a little hotter than we planned.

1402
01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:15.417
And sorry we trenched the lawn here.

1403
01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:17.669
Totally fixable. A bit of sod, we'll be fine.

1404
01:29:17.769 --> 01:29:19.171
Baby.
- Oh, my God.

1405
01:29:19.271 --> 01:29:22.366
Hi.
- Ah, I'm so happy to see you.

1406
01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:25.275
Teddy.

1407
01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:26.762
Teddy, here.

1408
01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:28.956
Hi, Dad.
- Oh, Teddy.

1409
01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:32.209
Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1410
01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:34.186
No. Your hand.

1411
01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:37.961
I know. We had an accident. I'm okay.

1412
01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:41.651
This is your fault.
- No, Dad.

1413
01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:43.695
He's right. Mr. Srisai, Lauren.

1414
01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:46.114
I haven't been completely honest with you.
- Stu?

1415
01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:47.324
Yeah?
- Don't do this.

1416
01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:49.974
Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it.

1417
01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:52.558
You said I'm chok.

1418
01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:55.099
Well, I'm not.

1419
01:29:55.265 --> 01:29:59.987
I'm not some weird milky, ricey,
watery goop...

1420
01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:02.839
...that you feed to infants
and old people, okay?

1421
01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:07.104
Maybe I would be
if you added some cayenne pepper.

1422
01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:13.433
I wish I was a boring dentist
who had a boring life and boring friends...

1423
01:30:13.533 --> 01:30:16.002
...but I don't, I'm not.

1424
01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:18.688
I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.

1425
01:30:18.788 --> 01:30:22.317
Hey, it's not weird. it's pretty cool, actually.
No membership fee...

1426
01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:24.736
I have heard enough of this.
You come here.

1427
01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:26.836
Whoa.

1428
01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:29.547
Here's the deal, man.

1429
01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:32.097
I got a dark side.

1430
01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:35.973
There's a demon in me.

1431
01:30:36.473 --> 01:30:39.108
It's true, he has semen in him.

1432
01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:41.044
I said 'demon.'

1433
01:30:41.144 --> 01:30:43.088
But you also have semen in you.
Remember?

1434
01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:46.673
That's not relevant, but thank you, Alan.

1435
01:30:47.609 --> 01:30:48.718
Point is...

1436
01:30:48.818 --> 01:30:53.369
...this demon takes me
to some pretty weird places.

1437
01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:57.016
And we lost Teddy
for two days in Bangkok.

1438
01:30:57.369 --> 01:31:01.273
But that same demon took us to hell
and back to find him.

1439
01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:03.923
We took on Bangkok and we won.

1440
01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:08.388
And that's pretty fucking cool
if you ask me. Right?

1441
01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:15.495
I love your daughter
and I'm gonna marry her...

1442
01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:17.747
...unless you have any problem with that.

1443
01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:19.847
I'm good.
- All right.

1444
01:31:20.266 --> 01:31:22.815
But all that said...

1445
01:31:22.978 --> 01:31:25.839
...it would actually mean a great deal
to both of us...

1446
01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:30.274
...if we could just get
your motherfucking blessing.

1447
01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:47.417
Hey, Alan.

1448
01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:50.906
Your head looks pretty cool shaved.

1449
01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:52.741
Thanks, Phil.

1450
01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:54.743
You should shave your head too.

1451
01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:56.202
Why would I do that?

1452
01:31:56.302 --> 01:31:59.957
Well, that way,
we would look exactly alike.

1453
01:32:10.066 --> 01:32:12.177
Take good care of my daughter, Stu.

1454
01:32:12.277 --> 01:32:15.326
I will.
- Thank you.

1455
01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:24.356
I'm sorry we almost
killed everyone with the boat.

1456
01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:26.550
Just happy you're here.

1457
01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:32.948
Don't worry about the tattoo. I'll have it
lasered as soon as we're home in L.A.

1458
01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:35.768
It's okay. I can get used to it.

1459
01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:38.051
Really?

1460
01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:43.458
But for now, let's switch sides?
- Yeah, okay.

1461
01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:45.558
Thank you.

1462
01:32:46.144 --> 01:32:48.144
Much better.

1463
01:32:49.022 --> 01:32:51.491
Dear family and friends...

1464
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:53.385
...on behalf of Stu and Lauren...

1465
01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:57.555
I welcome all of you
for this marriage celebration.

1466
01:32:57.655 --> 01:33:01.455
We are here today to encourage,
celebrate...

1467
01:33:36.736 --> 01:33:38.736
I walk along the avenue

1468
01:33:39.197 --> 01:33:43.168
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you

1469
01:33:43.785 --> 01:33:46.129
Meet a girl like you

1470
01:33:47.914 --> 01:33:53.011
And I ran Iran so far away

1471
01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:55.680
I couldn't get away

1472
01:33:56.214 --> 01:33:58.783
Thanks, buddy.
Can you hold on for a second?

1473
01:33:58.883 --> 01:34:00.883
Thank you. Ahem.

1474
01:34:08.017 --> 01:34:10.896
Hello? Hi, everyone.

1475
01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:14.299
I'm, uh... My name's Alan Garner.

1476
01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:20.702
Um, I want to thank the Asiatic
people for allowing us in your land.

1477
01:34:22.407 --> 01:34:26.603
I wanted to, um, say that, um,
I'm really happy to be here...

1478
01:34:26.703 --> 01:34:31.024
...and I have a wedding gift
to present to Lauren and Stu.

1479
01:34:31.124 --> 01:34:35.220
Um, and a lot of thought have gone
into this...

1480
01:34:35.378 --> 01:34:39.616
...and I hope that you appreciate it
as much I di... Are going to.

1481
01:34:39.716 --> 01:34:41.716
Okay. Guys.

1482
01:34:55.106 --> 01:34:57.926
Bangkok, Oriental setting, and the city
Don't know what the city is getting

1483
01:34:58.026 --> 01:34:59.719
Oh, fuck.

1484
01:34:59.819 --> 01:35:04.069
In a show with everything
But Yul Brynner, ya know?

1485
01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.195
One night in Bangkok
And the world's your oyster

1486
01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:13.900
The bars are temples
But the pearls, they ain't free

1487
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.800
You'll find a god in every golden cloister

1488
01:35:18.463 --> 01:35:21.699
And if you're lucky, then the god's a she

1489
01:35:21.799 --> 01:35:23.076
Alan.

1490
01:35:23.176 --> 01:35:25.495
I can feel the devil walking next to me

1491
01:35:25.595 --> 01:35:27.595
What the fuck, man?

1492
01:35:27.722 --> 01:35:30.667
So, what do you think?
- It's insane. How did you do that?

1493
01:35:30.767 --> 01:35:33.753
My dad had to make a lot of calls,
and then I told Mike, I said:

1494
01:35:33.853 --> 01:35:36.798
'You gotta do it.
It's for my third best friend.'

1495
01:35:36.898 --> 01:35:39.742
Alan, it's amazing. I love it.

1496
01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:41.010
Thank you so much.

1497
01:35:41.110 --> 01:35:45.431
We only have him for the night.
We don't own him permanently.

1498
01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:47.531
Understood.

1499
01:35:47.951 --> 01:35:52.001
One night in Bangkok
Makes the hard man humble

1500
01:35:52.538 --> 01:35:55.917
Not much between despair and ecstasy

1501
01:35:56.668 --> 01:36:00.343
I can feel the devil walking next to me

1502
01:36:03.091 --> 01:36:06.321
You do a lot of public speaking, Alan?

1503
01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:09.393
Mike, you were great.

1504
01:36:09.555 --> 01:36:11.833
It's true, that was incredible.

1505
01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:15.253
Thanks, guys. Thank you.
That means a lot. Really, it does.

1506
01:36:15.353 --> 01:36:18.798
By the way, you really need to remove
that fucking tattoo from your face.

1507
01:36:18.898 --> 01:36:20.898
Yep. On it.

1508
01:36:23.069 --> 01:36:25.263
Sorry about the last-minute
performance change.

1509
01:36:25.363 --> 01:36:27.348
Don't worry.
- What are you talking about?

1510
01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:30.602
Well, he was supposed to sing
'Burning Up' by the Jonas Brothers...

1511
01:36:30.702 --> 01:36:33.104
...but then I remembered
you don't like indie rock.

1512
01:36:33.204 --> 01:36:35.440
Hey, guys. You're not gonna believe this.

1513
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.918
Is that your phone?
- Yeah.

1514
01:36:38.084 --> 01:36:40.069
How come you never tried calling us?

1515
01:36:40.169 --> 01:36:41.821
It's been dead for two days.

1516
01:36:41.921 --> 01:36:44.282
But I recharged it
and found all these photos.

1517
01:36:44.382 --> 01:36:46.034
What?
- Oh, shit.

1518
01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:47.785
Some of it's pretty messed up.

1519
01:36:47.885 --> 01:36:50.955
Awesome. Let's check them out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1520
01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:52.624
No one needs to see this stuff.

1521
01:36:52.724 --> 01:36:55.627
Come on, man. I'm Mike Tyson.
I've seen everything.

1522
01:36:55.727 --> 01:36:57.855
It'll be fine.
- What...?

1523
01:36:59.397 --> 01:37:01.090
All right. But we look at it once...

1524
01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:04.845
And then we delete them.
It's gonna be okay.

1525
01:37:05.737 --> 01:37:07.737
Motherfucker.
