1
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,603
Atten-hut!

2
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:45,166
Here's our man.
Professor Howard Plummer.

3
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:48,907
He's been kidnapped
by a group of Serbian rebels.

4
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:53,111
I know we've been up for 72
hours, but I expect perfection.

5
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,154
Nothing else.

6
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:02,556
The enemy has a boat,
four jet skis, and a chopper.

7
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:05,392
I'll take you guys in
until we hit radar range.

8
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,126
Then you'll dive from there.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,963
Once we hit our target,

10
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,731
Red One, Red Two,
you take out our escorts.

11
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:15,331
I'll handle the chopper,
and I'll find the professor.

12
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,070
Red Three, you radio in
for our copter.

13
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,203
- Do you copy?
- Sir, yes sir!

14
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,042
- Do you copy?
- Sir, yes sir!

15
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:26,415
We are SEALS.
And this is what we do.

16
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,731
Ah!

17
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,314
Red Two, handle the boat.

18
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,477
I'll take care of the bozos
on the jet ski.

19
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,830
Ah!

20
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,172
Oh!

21
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:25,060
Gotcha.

22
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,832
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe,
U.S. Navy.

23
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,767
Where is the briefcase?

24
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:39,299
It's right behind you.
Man, am I glad to see you.

25
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:43,314
- I never thought I'd see my family...
- I'll get you out.

26
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,714
We're gonna do it my way.
No highway option.

27
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,480
Yeah, I'm with you. Absolutely.

28
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,435
Lieutenant, thank you so much
for saving my life.

29
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:11,908
If I had died back there,
my wife, she would've killed me.

30
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,377
Just a joke.

31
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:17,177
Do you mind if I call my wife
to tell her I'm okay?

32
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:20,013
I have strict orders
to get you out of here safely.

33
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,246
We gotta keep moving.

34
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,347
Lieutenant, I am safe.
Please. She thinks I'm dead.

35
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:28,359
- All right, make it quick.
- Okay.

36
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:32,090
Zoe, Seth, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.

37
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,959
It's voice activated.

38
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,595
Hey.

39
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,298
These are my kids.

40
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,734
You'd like 'em.
They're really great.

41
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,271
I doubt it. Hurry up.

42
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:51,407
Hey! We're almost ready.

43
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,782
Give us another sec.

44
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,323
Professor!

45
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,691
The doctor says you've
healed up real good, Shane.

46
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,704
I should've been
out of here weeks ago.

47
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,797
Look, I know heads
are gonna roll for this.

48
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,171
Hey, you took a bullet.

49
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,904
Yeah, but I want you to know
I take full responsibility

50
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,775
for what happened
to the professor.

51
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:23,076
Plummer was the best
security expert

52
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,014
the Department of Defense
ever had.

53
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:29,043
He was working on a program to scramble
launch codes that he called "GHOST":

54
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,555
Guided High-altitude
Scrambling Transmitter.

55
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,285
One pulse from a GHOST satellite

56
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,418
and a country can't launch
its own nukes.

57
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:37,689
That's why the Serbians
kidnapped him.

58
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:41,221
They must have thought that
GHOST was in that briefcase.

59
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,269
GHOST is still out there.

60
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:47,237
Which is why I'm sending you
back in.

61
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,740
I know you've never lost anybody
before, Shane.

62
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,243
I was with your father
when he led a platoon...

63
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,472
With all due respect,

64
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,981
I'd appreciate it if we kept
my father out of this.

65
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,813
All I'm saying is that it
happens to the best of them.

66
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:02,351
And you're the best.

67
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,412
I need someone I can trust on this

68
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,755
- and I know I can trust you.
- Okay.

69
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,089
I'll put a team together.

70
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:11,220
No. It's not
that kind of mission.

71
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,164
This is at the top of the Pentagon's
priority list.

72
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,164
<i>Two days ago,
I got a call from Admiral Blair.</i>

73
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,436
<i>It seems that the professor's widow
contacted him.</i>

74
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,999
<i>Whoever killed her husband</i>

75
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,238
<i>must think that GHOST
is still in that house.</i>

76
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,372
<i>Now, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.</i>

77
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:33,509
<i>A safety deposit box has been discovered
in Zurich in the Plummers' name.</i>

78
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,386
<i>I've been assigned to escort Mrs.
Plummer there to retrieve the contents.</i>

79
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:40,448
<i>We're hoping it's the GHOST program.</i>

80
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,393
<i>In the meantime, someone
needs to watch over those kids.</i>

81
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,054
<i>That's where you come in.</i>

82
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,259
<i>While there, you'll be looking
for the hidden program as well.</i>

83
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,483
Ah!

84
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:20,732
You must be Lieutenant Wolfe!
Admiral Blair said you'd be coming.

85
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,825
Come on in.
Meet the rest of the gang.

86
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,097
Come on.

87
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:30,370
Kids! Get your butts
down here and say hello!

88
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:35,812
Okay, you've already met Lulu.
This is Zoe, Seth and Peter.

89
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,748
Kids, this is Lieutenant Wolfe.

90
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,752
He's gonna stay with you
while I'm away.

91
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,811
- Hi.
- Hi.

92
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:47,188
Oh! This is Helga and Tyler.

93
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,352
Ma'am. Baby.

94
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,920
- That's a pretty dress.
- Thank you.

95
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:55,489
I have date
with butcher tonight.

96
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,502
I want to look nice.

97
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,834
Ah!

98
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,041
You have a pleasant family.

99
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:13,016
Well, for the younger ones,

100
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,144
I think it hasn't really
sunk in yet.

101
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,157
It's been hardest
on Zoe and Seth.

102
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,557
But they don't really
like to talk about it.

103
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,925
Well, it must be hard
on all of you.

104
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,294
Howard wasn't around much.

105
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,424
His work took him
all over the world.

106
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,298
He'd be gone six,
seven months at a time.

107
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,600
Yeah, I can understand
that lifestyle.

108
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,802
Anyway, about a week ago,

109
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,210
someone broke into the house.
No one was home.

110
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,976
I didn't tell the kids 'cause
I didn't wanna scare them.

111
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,778
Mrs. Plummer, I've dealt with...

112
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,046
Ow! Oh, my God!

113
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,453
I'm sorry. That's Gary.
He was Howard's.

114
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,388
Gary, down!

115
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,017
He bit me.

116
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,187
Yeah, well,
he thinks he's a guard dog.

117
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,791
- Mrs. Plummer?
- Oh, call me Julie. Please.

118
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,665
I'm gonna go outside
and have a look around.

119
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,102
Out, out.

120
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,500
I'm gonna miss you.
Mmm...

121
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:45,406
I'm gonna miss you too.

122
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:48,241
I'll be back in 48 hours, okay?

123
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,010
Bye, pumpkin.
I love you, pumpkin.

124
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,888
Oh, and kids? Remember,

125
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,517
whatever Lieutenant Wolfe
asks you to do, do it.

126
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:03,618
Mom, chill.
We're gonna be fine.

127
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,093
I'm sorry.
I don't do this very often.

128
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,863
You're going away for a few days.

129
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,233
Yeah, I know.

130
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,169
I got it.

131
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,900
Okay. Here you go, Helga.

132
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:19,001
- I take baby.
- Bye. Bye.

133
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,546
It's okay.

134
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:23,945
You remember
the emergency numbers, right?

135
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,008
Don't worry, Mrs. Plummer,
your kids'll be safe with me.

136
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,920
Your little angels will be fine,
Mrs. Plummer.

137
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,363
Go.

138
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:42,900
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

139
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,993
Have some fun.

140
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,301
Bye-bye.

141
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,838
Tell me,
are you licensed to kill?

142
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:55,539
No, ma'am.

143
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:59,641
Too bad.
It could have come in handy.

144
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,158
Ah!

145
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,494
<i>Prepare to be annihilated.</i>

146
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,391
Please!

147
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:18,959
Oh, my God! Shut up!

148
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,871
<i>Prepare to be annihilated.</i>

149
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,106
Hey!

150
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,149
- Where's the baby?
- Tell me. Come on.

151
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:33,707
No!

152
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,220
Shut up! No, she didn't.

153
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,916
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

154
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,515
Oh, my God. Tell me!

155
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:43,083
Is there anyone here
that understands

156
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,130
the meaning of the word
"discipline"?

157
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:49,725
Hey, Flipper. You don't like it?
Do something. I make bottle.

158
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,104
Thank you, Peter.

159
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,575
Yes!

160
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,734
- Ow!
- Gotcha!

161
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,862
Ah!

162
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,069
What's your problem?
Get off me!

163
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,134
Oh, my God!

164
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,807
What are you doing, you spaz?
That's my boyfriend!

165
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,941
So you're the one breaking in!

166
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,507
- Go back inside!
- No!

167
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,699
We speak English, buddy.

168
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,291
Look, about the sirens
and the strobe lights.

169
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,566
We own a bakery, so we're up
kind of early. Would you mind?

170
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,435
Sorry.

171
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:07,606
Oh, and we found this
in our pool filter.

172
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,239
Keep that zoo reined in,
huh, babysitter?

173
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:16,019
Yo, fool, handle me like that again
and I'll lay knuckles upside your head!

174
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,613
Okay! Enough is enough!
Come on, Scott, let's go!

175
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,282
- Come on.
- No, you don't.

176
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:25,296
Get back here.
Give me 20.

177
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,831
I meant push-ups!

178
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,164
- Zoe?
- Drop down! Do 20!

179
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:33,329
- This is not the Army or Navy!
- One...

180
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,566
Real nice move, Lt. Smooth.

181
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,336
He'll probably never speak to me!

182
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,877
- Then I did you a favor.
- Whoa!

183
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,537
Personal bubble invasion.

184
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:43,911
Your mother was worried sick
about you!

185
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:45,882
You should call here and tell her.

186
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,181
I'm sure you'll take care of that
for me.

187
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:50,881
Stay out of my life!

188
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,853
Wait! You can't do this!

189
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,761
I have plans!
It's Saturday night! Ow!

190
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,229
Not anymore.

191
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:07,361
- You too. Lights out.
- Bite me.

192
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,873
Boy, this family's in
for a rude awakening.

193
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,150
What are you doing?

194
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,211
You're burning daylight! Move!

195
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,780
It's Sunday.

196
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:02,860
And it's 6am!
You're insane!

197
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,765
Listen up!

198
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,533
Your behavior is unacceptable.

199
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,870
In order to maintain
a state of safety,

200
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,773
we need to maintain
a state of order.

201
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,937
One more little bite?

202
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,447
We going to be strong mine
worker when we grow up.

203
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,914
Excuse me.

204
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,678
Excuse me!

205
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:30,919
Now, I've only got one rule.

206
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,958
Everything is done my way.
No highway option.

207
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,392
- Do you copy?
- Do you copy?

208
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:43,262
What? I said, "Do you copy?"

209
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,328
- Do not copy me.
- Do not copy me.

210
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:52,408
Hey, I mean it.
Cut it out!

211
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:54,274
Uh...

212
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,106
Peter farted.

213
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,583
- Oh, that is so gross.
- Quiet!

214
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:04,588
Everybody up.
That means you too.

215
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:08,114
Tracking devices,
never take them off.

216
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,357
The panic button
is for emergencies only.

217
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,332
Touch that,
you'd better be dying.

218
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,265
Or you're dead.

219
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,305
I would rather chew off my arm
than wear that.

220
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,536
Just because my mom is paranoid doesn't
mean we have to take orders from you.

221
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,873
Let me explain how
the chain of command works.

222
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,778
I tell you what to do
and you do it!

223
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,874
End of chain.

224
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,943
I'm not gonna have time
to remember all of your names.

225
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:41,391
You'll be Red Leader.
Red Baby. Red One. Red.

226
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,320
Where's the older male?
There were five.

227
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,731
He walks like Dracula

228
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:54,966
with footsteps
silent like death.

229
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,735
He's in his room.

230
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,103
Red Two!

231
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,315
Red Two, open up!

232
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,980
Red Two!

233
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,329
What have you done?

234
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,989
What? I thought...

235
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,431
Is this what you're
trained to do?

236
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,264
A "shock and awe" on my door?

237
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,396
I can fix that
with a hammer and some nails.

238
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,565
- It's real easy to fix.
- No, it's not! Look!

239
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,441
It's broken in half!
You can't fix that!

240
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,970
If you'd been wearing this,
this wouldn't have happened.

241
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:42,418
What are you talking about?
I was in the bathroom!

242
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:45,456
You know I would never
ask you for your help...

243
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,924
...but he has got to go.

244
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,240
Somebody help me, please!

245
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,372
Help me, somebody!

246
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:14,818
- Stop it, Peter! This is nuts!
- Peter, cut this out.

247
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:22,750
Hey, good soldiers
aren't scared of anything.

248
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,693
I'm not scared. I'm annoyed.

249
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:28,028
Ever since he heard Daddy say
there was a ghost in the house,

250
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:32,468
he puts on that blanket and chases me
everywhere. It drives me crazy.

251
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:34,198
Peter, have you seen this ghost?

252
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,180
All right, here he comes.

253
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,194
Hey! You leave towel
on floor in bathroom.

254
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,599
I pick up after kids,
not you.

255
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:07,467
And light a match next time.

256
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,305
Oh!

257
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,611
Good news.

258
00:20:23,688 --> 00:20:25,815
Your background checks
have cleared,

259
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,825
and we are free
to give you the box.

260
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,622
- Oh.
- Excellent.

261
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:33,152
Just as soon as you
provide us with the passwords.

262
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,391
Passwords?

263
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,956
It was your husband's wish

264
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,093
that the person who collects the box

265
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:40,603
must provide us
with the passwords.

266
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,799
Great.

267
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,638
- Is it "The GHOST?"
- Ghost.

268
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,337
Mmm... No.

269
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:55,686
<i>These brats! Sugi pula!</i>

270
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,847
I had it!

271
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,859
- Remain calm.
- I am calm.

272
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,988
I quit!
That makes me calm.

273
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,931
Let's not be hasty about this.

274
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,009
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

275
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,038
<i>- Don't even think about it!
- Lt. Wolfe?</i>

276
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:26,242
<i>It's Julie Plummer.</i>

277
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,115
<i>- Who's this?
- Julie Plummer.</i>

278
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,347
<i>- What's that?
- Julie Plummer!</i>

279
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,390
Ah!

280
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,789
<i>- Oh, Mrs. Plummer.
- Did something fall?</i>

281
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:37,851
<i>- What was that noise?
- Nothing. Everything's okay!</i>

282
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,797
You'll be happy to know that I found
the culprit that's been sneaking around!

283
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:43,925
<i>- Great. Who was it?
- Just some teenager.</i>

284
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,563
<i>Teenager? I wanted to tell you
I'm gonna be a few more days.</i>

285
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,732
You'll be a few more days?

286
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,437
<i>- Yes, is that a problem?
- No, that's no problem!</i>

287
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:57,038
No, I'm fine.
I'm just... I'm just doing my...

288
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,639
<i>Your what?</i>

289
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,618
<i>- Duty.
- Sure everything's okay?</i>

290
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:04,279
Things are great,
Mrs. Plummer.

291
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,688
Yeah, you just do
whatever you have to.

292
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,784
<i>- Well, tell the kids I said...
- Bye, Mrs. Plummer!</i>

293
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,490
Just hang...
Let's calm down.

294
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,799
Just... just try to relax.

295
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:22,499
Ah!

296
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,476
Ah! She bit me!

297
00:22:30,548 --> 00:22:33,312
Red Leader!

298
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,548
I command you to come back here!
That's a direct order!

299
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,816
You can't leave a man behind!

300
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,051
Red Leader!

301
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,088
Red Leader!

302
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,994
I don't even know
how to change a diaper!

303
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,426
Don't worry!

304
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,595
If she loves you,
she'll come back, huh?

305
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,869
Okay, everybody, listen up.
There's been a change of plans.

306
00:22:57,942 --> 00:23:00,672
Your mother's not coming home
as soon as she expected.

307
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:03,270
- When is she coming back?
- Soon.

308
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,475
For now,
we'll just have some more big fun.

309
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,711
That's what we've been doing?
Having fun?

310
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,119
- Tomorrow's a school day.
- I have wrestling.

311
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,747
I need a release for Driver's Ed.

312
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,314
I've got Fireflies.

313
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,552
I have to go to the mall.

314
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,561
I have to stop her
from spending so much.

315
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,893
Whoa, okay, Halt. Halt!

316
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:22,125
We'll take this hill
one inch at a time.

317
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,134
Only then can we rise
to the challenge.

318
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,341
Okay,
who's gonna change Red Baby?

319
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,001
Guys?

320
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,582
Ah!

321
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:43,746
God! Red Baby!

322
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,492
Alrighty. We'll try this.

323
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,892
Yes. Whoa.

324
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,829
Ooh. Soak that up a bit.

325
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,436
Hi. Zoe says you look
like The Hulk.

326
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,171
I think you're cute.

327
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,270
Thank you.

328
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,615
- Do you do kung fu?
- Yes.

329
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:19,179
Did you ever punch someone
so hard that their head came off?

330
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,088
No.

331
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,261
Why are your boobs so big?

332
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,024
They're not boobs.

333
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,261
Do you have to wear a bra?

334
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:40,001
Will my boobs
get as big as yours someday?

335
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,413
You know, little girl,

336
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:51,251
I think it's time you went
nappy-poo in beddy-bye land.

337
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:54,883
Do I look like I'm five to you?

338
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,325
What did I say?

339
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:02,024
Disrespectful. And to think
I was interested in you!

340
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:08,638
Okay, troops! Breakfast!

341
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:10,901
What are you waiting for?
Dig in.

342
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:12,465
Feel free to mix and match.

343
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,104
Stay away from the cheese.
It'll back you up.

344
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,308
Don't worry about running out.
I can get lots more of these.

345
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,442
I've survived months
off this stuff.

346
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:23,316
Okay, like, I'm really gonna eat
all of these carbs?

347
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,454
I can cross my eyes.
Wanna see?

348
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,923
No.

349
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,564
Tyler hates it when I do that.

350
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:39,466
I know how he feels.

351
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,933
What's he...? Red Four!

352
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,878
Plummer residence.

353
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,856
Yes, I know it's Monday today.

354
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,017
No, Mrs. Plummer's away.

355
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,722
Yes, we'll be right there.

356
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,289
Who was that?

357
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,595
Your vice principal.

358
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:12,135
He said that if you and Seth
are late again,

359
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,830
you're both suspended.

360
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,601
He wants to see you
in his office right away.

361
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,734
What is it?

362
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:57,872
- It's a minivan.
- Ugh.

363
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,577
Now,
is this supposed to...?

364
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,143
- How do we...?
- Excuse me, Mr. Wolfe?

365
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,689
If you don't hurry up,
we're gonna be late for sure.

366
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,748
Not on my watch.

367
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,759
- Hold that.
- How fast is your watch?

368
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,894
You'll be suspended for sure.

369
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,437
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

370
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,102
Who drives like this?
You're crazy!

371
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,688
What are you doing?
Stop!

372
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,954
Got 'em here.

373
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:46,121
My fault.

374
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:50,258
Yeah, I always said these kids
needed a parole officer.

375
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,395
I guess, uh, Mrs. Plummer
thought so too, huh?

376
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:58,905
Wow, you got a real, uh,
upper torso going on, huh?

377
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,638
You ever, uh, do any time?

378
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,679
Sasquatch.

379
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,582
- You got something to say, boy?
- No.

380
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,347
No? Good.

381
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,446
Wow, it looks like you
have a pair of legs

382
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:14,184
coming out of your shoulders.

383
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:16,954
- You hit the gym a lot, do you?
- Eh.

384
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,656
- Woolly Mammoth.
- You know what, Creeper?

385
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:23,428
You just bought yourself
an extra 15 minutes on the mats.

386
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,662
With the Murninator!

387
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:29,104
Excuse me.
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe.

388
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:32,438
I'm watching the kids
for the Plummers. A few days.

389
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,842
Oh, babysitter, huh?

390
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:37,745
Well, good.
Whatever job you can get, right?

391
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:40,841
I'm Murney.
Duane Murney.

392
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:43,250
My friends call me
"Little Puppet. "

393
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,720
I'm the VP here.

394
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,316
I'm in charge of discipline,
conduct and truancy

395
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:52,625
from top to bottom,
K through 12.

396
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,029
You're in my house now,
strong man.

397
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:58,728
- You're the vice principal.
- And the wrestling coach.

398
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,464
See the Creeper over there?

399
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:04,133
He has played hooky from every
wrestling practice this month.

400
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:08,235
And her, she has missed
22 Driver's Ed classes.

401
00:29:08,312 --> 00:29:10,837
Out of 23!

402
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,247
These are the worst students
in my school.

403
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:16,343
- I'm ashamed...
- Your school?

404
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:20,590
Good morning, kids.

405
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:23,559
Mr. Murney,
thanks for watching my chair.

406
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,461
- I'll take it from here.
- Roger. Absolutely.

407
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,556
I was just informing
our new friend here

408
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,965
about some of the duties
as vice principal.

409
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,902
Speaking of which, how's it
going with the investigation

410
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:36,439
into the baloney slices
on the cafeteria ceiling?

411
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:39,635
- Taking some interesting turns.
- Keep up the good work.

412
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,941
Right. I'll be on the roof.

413
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,448
Bye, now.

414
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:47,814
All right, it's time
to get back to class.

415
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:51,946
I'll cut you some slack seeing as
it's Lt. Wolfe's first day. Thank you.

416
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,548
Okay.

417
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,093
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Yes, please.

418
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,530
So, what's with this Murninator?

419
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,194
He's big, he's hairy,
he's sometimes smelly,

420
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:07,464
but he's harmless
and he has tenure.

421
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:10,132
So, you're the bodyguard?

422
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,005
Mrs. Plummer thought the kids...

423
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:15,512
She briefed me on everything
and she told me that the kids

424
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,480
aren't fully aware of the situation

425
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:19,641
and that's the way she wants it.

426
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:24,487
She also told me
you're a "Teams" guy.

427
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:27,456
- Yes, I am.
- Well, Petty Officer Third Class

428
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,551
- Claire Fletcher at your service.
- You're kidding.

429
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:33,791
Four years at Naval Base
Coronado. They paid for college.

430
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,698
- Honor, courage.
- Commitment.

431
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,928
It's the way I run this school.

432
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,334
I like that.

433
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:48,006
So, permission to stick around
and keep eyes on the kids?

434
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,343
Permission granted.

435
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,787
<i>We don't need no music
We don't need no band</i>

436
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,762
<i>All we need is Mustangs
and jammin' in the stands</i>

437
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,095
<i>We said jammin' in the stands</i>

438
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,432
<i>J- A-M-M-I-N
Jammin' in the stands</i>

439
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:16,530
<i>What? J-A-M-M-I-N
Jammin' in the stands</i>

440
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:19,633
Go, Mustangs! Whoo!

441
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,111
"Black belt.
Honorable discharge. "

442
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,172
Clean as a whistle.

443
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:30,049
- Yeah, you little punk!
- Where's your babysitter now?

444
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,720
Hey!

445
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,660
- Enough.
- All right, you heard the lady.

446
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:41,323
Let's break it up, guys.
Come on. Hmm?

447
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,062
Relax, Popeye.
Boys will be boys, huh?

448
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,970
It's kinda good for the Creeper.
Gives him a chance to punk up.

449
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,339
- Learn to defend himself.
- Six against one?

450
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,344
Well, the odds are never pretty.

451
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,744
But look at it as, like,
a preparation for him.

452
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,543
The naked streets of Bethesda

453
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:00,742
can be so dark and dangerous.

454
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:04,846
- Right, Creeper?
- Ooh. Whoa.

455
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:07,152
You're pretty quick there, frogman.

456
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,455
I, myself,
happen to be a black belt.

457
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:12,257
That's why they wanted me
to coach the wrestling team.

458
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,764
Ooh-ah!

459
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,096
Sensei.

460
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,329
You know what that's called, homeboy?

461
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:21,735
Total control.

462
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,364
You all right? Hmm?

463
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,239
Maybe sometime you can pop by
the wrestling class

464
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,972
and, uh, we'll show the boys
how a couple pros do it.

465
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:31,071
What do you think?
I'll go easy on you.

466
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:33,810
- I'm on duty.
- You're on duty.

467
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:35,977
Oh, that's right,
you're a babysitter.

468
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:39,079
So it's kinda like "doo-doo" duty.

469
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,920
Don't worry about it.

470
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:46,930
We'll do it on a day when you're
not, uh, washing your hair. Hmm?

471
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,460
And I'll see you in class.

472
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,304
At ease.

473
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,766
That guy don't have his head on right.

474
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:02,539
I was fine!
I don't need your help!

475
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,384
Okay, okay.

476
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:13,719
- Aw. Hey, rough day?
- I tried feeding him.

477
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,383
Yeah? Did you try changing him?

478
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:18,257
- Would you help me?
- No.

479
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,991
Just the thought of...

480
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,506
- Emergency.
- What are you...? I... Hey!

481
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,107
Hi.

482
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,168
What's up with him?

483
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,237
Where are you going?

484
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:24,593
Hey!
What's wrong with you?

485
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,737
Ha-ha.

486
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,647
I should go, okay?

487
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,050
Call me, you guys,
if you need anything.

488
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,884
My number's on the fridge.

489
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:27,446
Are you okay?

490
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:31,153
Oh... Wow.

491
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,393
Is there anything I can do?

492
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,195
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

493
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,101
- Can I get you anything?
- I'm fine.

494
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,230
I mean, they're just kids,
you know.

495
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,707
Call me if you need anything.
Okay?

496
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,643
After you shower.
Or, before. It doesn't matter.

497
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:50,703
I'll see you guys.

498
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:58,988
Very funny.
Thank you for the letter.

499
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:27,014
Guys, be quiet.
I told you he had boobs.

500
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,182
Lulu, can I see you
in the family room?

501
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:37,552
Who are those people?

502
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:41,291
My troop. Monday, Wednesday
and Saturday are troop nights.

503
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,230
- Get rid of 'em.
- I can't.

504
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,428
Parents go out on troop nights.
They'll be back at 8:00.

505
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:48,027
Mom's our den mother!

506
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:51,370
You better tell your little
friends that they have to...

507
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,841
- Today we're supposed to sell cookies.
- I don't do cookies.

508
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,649
We have to. If we don't
sell enough cookies,

509
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,384
we can't go
to the Jamboree.

510
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:15,122
They're waving at me.

511
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,636
All right, ladies!
Here's how it's gonna be!

512
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:22,433
Tonight I'm your den mother.

513
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,134
That means if you want
to live to see tomorrow,

514
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,109
you do exactly as I say!

515
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:29,372
Do we understand each other?

516
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:32,381
Den mother,
you frighten me.

517
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:34,178
Good.

518
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:36,378
Now, let's move out!

519
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:49,229
- I call the front!
- Middle back!

520
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:50,994
Fine, I'll get the back.

521
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,502
Yeah, he's kind
of a dork, but he's okay.

522
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,868
<i>- How's Helga?
- Helga's fine.</i>

523
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:58,237
<i>- When are you getting home?
- I'm sorry...</i>

524
00:37:58,308 --> 00:38:02,074
Look, Mom, I'd love to stay and chat
all day, but I have homework to do.

525
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:25,296
Oh, no!
They're back!

526
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:35,433
Hey, Skeever, what glows
in the dark till you squish 'em?

527
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:36,604
Fireflies!

528
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:47,282
Please. Leave us alone.

529
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:49,188
This is troop 16 territory.

530
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:51,625
How are we supposed
to sell raffle tickets

531
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:54,289
if this place reeks
of your skanky cookies?

532
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:56,559
Hey! Hey!

533
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:59,227
Boo!

534
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:02,295
Get outta here!

535
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:05,808
- These cookies taste disgusting.
- I know.

536
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:09,812
- We really scared these guys.
- Where are my troops?

537
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,522
Lulu, what happened?

538
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,153
Those boys over there
broke our cookies.

539
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,821
Broke your cookies.

540
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,422
- Mm-hm.
- Lulu, this is not a toy.

541
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,528
Forget those boys. I am here
to protect you, not cookies.

542
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,596
Understand?

543
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:39,836
Good, now get in the car.
We're all going home.

544
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,607
Wait. You can't take us home yet.
You're supposed to take us to eat.

545
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,540
Where do you usually go?

546
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,984
Welcome to Woody Woodchuck's!

547
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,858
Let go!

548
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,494
And they say war is hell.

549
00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:26,684
Ah! I figured you'd
come back for him.

550
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,658
Lulu, watch your brother.
Inexcusable!

551
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:32,251
- I've never left a man behind.
- Oh, relax.

552
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,765
Once we found a kid in the ball pool
when we opened in the morning.

553
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:37,231
Whoa! Whoa!

554
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:41,931
Not cool! Uh, there is no
freestyling in the ball pool!

555
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,282
Should we send
someone in after him?

556
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:03,120
We're good.

557
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,064
Holy baloney.

558
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:20,041
Ooh! Someone's gonna get busted!

559
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,635
- Who are these people?
- What's wrong with this?

560
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:27,013
- We need to talk.
- Don't hate the player, hate the game.

561
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,516
Beat it.

562
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:40,424
Party's over!

563
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:42,226
Oh, my God, it's here.

564
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,291
You're all gonna clean
this house spotless.

565
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,600
No highway option.
Now, get cleaning.

566
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,640
- I'm outta here!
- Wait! Scott!

567
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:52,732
Move! Later!

568
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,577
Oh, no, you don't.

569
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,152
This is my favorite shirt.

570
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,870
Thank you.

571
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,273
Come on, Seth! You've
been in there for an hour!

572
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,146
Thanks a lot, Lt. Loser! Now
I'm gonna be the school joke.

573
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,445
I don't know what
I'll say to my friends.

574
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:10,486
You call those people
your friends?

575
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:14,046
They have no respect for you.
They have no respect for your home.

576
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,684
You have no respect
for yourself!

577
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,160
I do, too, respect myself!

578
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,595
Company downstairs.
That means you too.

579
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,065
You're not my dad.

580
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,999
In case you
haven't noticed,

581
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:28,765
this family is going through
a really hard time

582
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,433
and you're just making
everything a lot worse.

583
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,567
You have no feelings.

584
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:37,374
We hate you
and you hate us.

585
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:39,745
So why don't you
just leave us alone?

586
00:43:39,816 --> 00:43:43,149
Don't worry. When your
mom comes back, I'm gone.

587
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,747
- Now what?
- Scott.

588
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,622
Run! Take the babies!
Go to your rooms!

589
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,250
Shane! Come over here!
Take one of these!

590
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:19,686
Lulu!

591
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:24,122
- Get inside. Come on.
- Hey! Hey! Wait!

592
00:45:25,288 --> 00:45:27,381
Don't move.

593
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,826
Ahhhh!

594
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,471
Kids, it's safe!

595
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:50,172
- Who was that? What'd they want?
- What happened?

596
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,408
- Don't leave us!
- What do they want?

597
00:45:52,482 --> 00:45:55,349
They were after the program
that your father invented.

598
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:01,453
They were after this.

599
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:06,459
All right, all right, come on,
guys. Let's hope this is it.

600
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:15,060
<i>- 9- 2-6, 3-1-0-4-3.
- 9- 2-6...</i>

601
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:16,196
<i>3- 1-0-4-3.</i>

602
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,138
<i>They want our
Ghost movie?</i>

603
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,039
Haven't they heard
of Blockbuster?

604
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,102
<i>- Tell her Rita Miller.
- Rita Miller.</i>

605
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:26,114
So there really are people
out there to get us?

606
00:46:26,182 --> 00:46:28,742
Yes, there are, Zoe.
That's why I'm here.

607
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:31,878
I think we're gonna need
a little more cooperation.

608
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,413
From now on,
you listen to me...

609
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,255
...and I'll listen to you too.

610
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,755
Deal?

611
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,693
- Relax. Relax.
- I'm relaxed.

612
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,565
- If you just relax...
- I'm relaxed! I'm relaxed!

613
00:46:46,636 --> 00:46:49,571
You've got to relax!
Please, it's on the...

614
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,470
Okay. I'm not
feeling well, here.

615
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:54,271
- Oh, my God! There's a bee!
- There's no bee!

616
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,904
- There's a bee!
- There's no bee! Stop! Please!

617
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,012
Okay, so she wrecked the car.
The insurance will pay for it.

618
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:05,486
They were parallel parking.
The instructor jumped.

619
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:08,456
But it's not about her.
It's about the boy.

620
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,254
Has he been
skipping class again?

621
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,319
Skipping class? He always
skips sixth period, but...

622
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:14,454
All right. Seth!

623
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,024
Okay, take off the hat.

624
00:47:20,203 --> 00:47:21,534
Go ahead.

625
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:27,136
Look at that.
That's how he showed up for practice.

626
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,237
I was doing a little recon in
his locker and I found this.

627
00:47:32,682 --> 00:47:34,206
Okay?

628
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:38,311
If it was a girlie
magazine or a hamster, fine.

629
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:42,324
Boys will be boys.
But this is sick.

630
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,519
All right. He dyed his hair.
He's not a Nazi.

631
00:47:44,594 --> 00:47:46,960
This is not normal.
We're very concerned.

632
00:47:48,631 --> 00:47:50,622
Why don't you get back to class?

633
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,100
Mr. Murney, would you
give me a minute?

634
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:00,670
Look, I'm sure this
is about their father.

635
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:05,113
We've tried to get Seth and Zoe to talk
to the psychologist, but they won't.

636
00:48:05,181 --> 00:48:07,843
Maybe you can get through to them?
See what's going on?

637
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:10,044
I'll talk to them
and see what I can do.

638
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,583
Thanks.

639
00:48:14,924 --> 00:48:19,156
Seth, I don't understand
unless you explain it to me.

640
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,629
Why would you join wrestling
if you hate it?

641
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,689
Because my father
wanted me to!

642
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:27,168
Look, I know you're
just trying to help, but don't!

643
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,432
I can take care of myself.

644
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,789
Refrigerator magnet.

645
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,630
Smart kid.

646
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,261
Red One!

647
00:48:59,335 --> 00:49:04,068
You're in charge. Anyone gets within
40 clicks of the perimeter, signal me.

648
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,576
Keep all doors sealed, do
your homework, preheat the oven

649
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,841
and don't let Lulu
in the cookie jar.

650
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:44,979
- Everything's ready?
- Yeah.

651
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,510
Come on.

652
00:50:05,768 --> 00:50:09,898
All right. All my Nazis
are finally here.

653
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:13,340
I want all of you
at attention!

654
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:16,776
Okay, let's start
where we left off yesterday.

655
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,558
We open in a week, people.
The set isn't finished.

656
00:51:05,628 --> 00:51:08,995
Mother Abbess just quit
because she got shingles!

657
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:13,525
And every step-ball change would
make Bob Fosse rise from the grave

658
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:16,197
just so he could have
a heart attack again!

659
00:51:16,272 --> 00:51:20,868
- I'm really sorry. I'll get it right.
- No, you won't, Seth.

660
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:24,778
You and your mother
over here can't get it right.

661
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:28,214
And I know this
because I am a professional.

662
00:51:28,284 --> 00:51:30,718
<i>I directed Show Boat
with Greg Brady.</i>

663
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,085
It wasn't union,
but it was good.

664
00:51:40,463 --> 00:51:42,454
Obviously, I quit!

665
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:47,265
Exeunt stage right!

666
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:53,642
Seriously, Seth, if you drop me
again, I'm going to kill you.

667
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,940
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

668
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,912
I'm fine.

669
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,673
Come on.

670
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,843
I'm not gonna quit!

671
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:06,912
- I don't expect you to understand...
- Hey...

672
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,949
I may not understand a whole
hell of a lot about this kinda stuff,

673
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,552
but I definitely
understand not quitting.

674
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,724
And from what I see,
you're pretty good.

675
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:19,962
A little discipline,
you could make a go of this.

676
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:23,403
- But what about Murney?
- He's an all-talk spaz.

677
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,941
<i>So, The Sound of Music?</i>

678
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,944
- I saw it when I was a kid.
- Really?

679
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:33,711
The idea of a nun ditching her
habit for a guy in the military.

680
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:37,184
Nothing wrong with that.

681
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:39,312
Do you think girls
will think I'm weird?

682
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:42,290
They probably already do, Seth.

683
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:44,622
But you'll kill 'em later.

684
00:52:46,729 --> 00:52:48,924
Come here.

685
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:52,456
Forget about everyone else
for a second.

686
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:55,800
Is performing
what makes you happy?

687
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,340
Yeah,
more than anything.

688
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:03,435
All right, fall in.

689
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,277
Company. Center stage.

690
00:53:09,118 --> 00:53:11,814
Company! Center stage!

691
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:14,755
Who is this guy?

692
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:20,194
Now, do you or do you not have
what it takes to perform this musical?

693
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:24,063
- We don't have a director.
- I've directed rescue missions

694
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:26,567
all around the world.

695
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:29,696
I've directed numerous
snatch-and-grabs

696
00:53:29,772 --> 00:53:34,505
from countries whose names
you are not allowed to know.

697
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:39,276
I've choreographed
multi-pronged amphibious landings

698
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,874
and stealth air attacks!

699
00:53:41,951 --> 00:53:47,082
Do you think I have
the military proficiency...

700
00:53:47,156 --> 00:53:50,216
...to direct this production?

701
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,760
Yes.

702
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:54,695
- Yes, what?
- Yes, sir!

703
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:57,731
Once upon a time,
there was a family...

704
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,597
...of elves.

705
00:53:59,635 --> 00:54:04,902
And one day the little elf family

706
00:54:04,974 --> 00:54:08,307
went into the magic forest

707
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,609
to find a secret...

708
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,740
...gnome...

709
00:54:13,816 --> 00:54:15,181
...facility,

710
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:21,121
where the gnomes were
turning mushrooms into uranium.

711
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:27,129
So three elves laid down heavy
suppressive fire on the gnomes

712
00:54:27,196 --> 00:54:32,532
while the others maneuvered
around to the right flank,

713
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:36,936
finishing off anything left alive.

714
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:45,178
And not one of those elves
were left behind that day.

715
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,409
We got 'em all.

716
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,750
Even the teeniest...

717
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:57,759
...littlest elf of all...

718
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,159
...Rodriguez.

719
00:55:00,229 --> 00:55:03,756
You're gonna have to do
the Panda dance or he won't stop.

720
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,358
Oh, come on...

721
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,597
I don't know how to do
the Panda dance.

722
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:11,162
I'll write it down for you.

723
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,232
Close your eyes. Go to sleep.
I'll be right back.

724
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,074
You gotta do the dance.

725
00:55:17,146 --> 00:55:21,276
Like Dad used to do.
He made it up for him.

726
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:24,012
You have to do the dance
to make him sleep.

727
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:27,988
Come on.

728
00:55:42,738 --> 00:55:45,263
- Lulu.
- Thank you.

729
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,571
Seth.

730
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:49,304
Zoe. Uh!

731
00:55:49,378 --> 00:55:51,278
Today you drive.

732
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:54,475
But I can't even
pass Driver's Ed.

733
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,745
Exactly.

734
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,648
We're all gonna die.

735
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,453
Have you ever given
a driving lesson before?

736
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,224
In a minivan? No.

737
00:56:08,297 --> 00:56:10,697
Think of it like
a Bradley Assault Vehicle.

738
00:56:10,766 --> 00:56:12,358
Especially when Zoe's driving.

739
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:20,508
- Zoe Plummer!
- Zoe, what are you doing?

740
00:56:20,576 --> 00:56:23,067
- What are...? Slow down!
- Truck!

741
00:56:29,952 --> 00:56:32,420
Whoa! Whoa!

742
00:56:32,488 --> 00:56:35,355
- Whoa!
- Not bad.

743
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,822
Land! Solid land!

744
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,891
- I think it went well.
- Oh, it's so dramatic.

745
00:56:47,336 --> 00:56:49,827
Hey, hey, hey. No fighting.

746
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,567
- Play nicely.
- Sorry.

747
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,269
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

748
00:56:54,343 --> 00:56:58,609
I have noticed an improvement in the
Plummer kids and I'm very impressed.

749
00:56:58,714 --> 00:57:01,774
Yeah, you know,
they're just misunderstood.

750
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:04,411
Peter, careful!
Don't make me come up there!

751
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,183
Someone needs to take the time
to talk to 'em.

752
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:11,590
- You're getting a little attached.
- I take my job very seriously.

753
00:57:12,361 --> 00:57:15,558
But it's like you said.
They're just kids.

754
00:57:15,631 --> 00:57:19,829
Well, keep up the good work.

755
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,266
Oh!

756
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,705
You look very nice today.

757
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:30,709
Oh. Thanks.

758
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,307
I don't think you understand.
Don't you ever do that again.

759
00:57:34,383 --> 00:57:36,817
Is that clear?
Okay, I've had it.

760
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:40,982
I caught the kid dancing to no music.
I want him out of my class.

761
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:43,958
Somebody's gotta give this punk
a talking to.

762
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:46,756
Seth?

763
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:49,696
Well, you got something
to say, twinkle toes?

764
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,802
Yeah. Yeah, I do, Murney.

765
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:56,064
- I quit.
- You quit.

766
00:57:56,138 --> 00:57:59,130
You know why you quit?
Because you're a quitter.

767
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:02,177
And everybody knows
that quitters...

768
00:58:02,244 --> 00:58:03,711
...quit.

769
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,449
What are you scared of, Prancer?

770
00:58:08,517 --> 00:58:12,613
- I'm not scared. I want to act.
- And I want to take up origami.

771
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:16,055
<i>- I'm in The Sound of Music.
- Oh. A musical.</i>

772
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,787
You're giving up wrestling
to be in a musical.

773
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:21,523
That happens when there
isn't a man in the house.

774
00:58:21,597 --> 00:58:25,465
There is a man
in the house. It's me.

775
00:58:25,534 --> 00:58:29,527
Well,
it's gotta be a tiny house.

776
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,900
You think you're tough, boy,
don't you?

777
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:39,581
Wanna shave the tiger?
Do you? Huh?

778
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,482
- You want it tough?
- Where did you wanna do this?

779
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:46,681
- What are you talking about?
- You said you wanted to wrestle.

780
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:48,917
Where? When?

781
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,552
- After school.
- Okay.

782
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:57,590
- Today?
- That's right. The gym.

783
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,225
Okay?

784
00:58:59,301 --> 00:59:04,000
Remember. You mess with
the bull, you get the horns.

785
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:15,146
Out of my way!

786
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:20,052
- How did that feel?
- It was good.

787
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:28,060
Murney is getting
his butt kicked at 3:00!

788
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,335
Oh, that is so gross.

789
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:41,808
Come on! Come on!

790
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:45,278
What? That's it!

791
00:59:45,347 --> 00:59:48,874
Someone's gonna get hurt today
and you know who it is?

792
00:59:55,858 --> 01:00:00,454
You're about to enter
Murney's House of Pain!

793
01:00:00,529 --> 01:00:05,592
What do you say we go over
the rules, cue ball? Huh?

794
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,436
Oooh!

795
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:10,870
Rule number one.

796
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,206
Never be too eager
to rush your opponent.

797
01:00:15,277 --> 01:00:20,078
Wanna play prison rules, frogman?
Wanna play prison rules? You got it.

798
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:23,175
I'll be your daddy.

799
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:28,483
Ah!

800
01:00:28,557 --> 01:00:31,390
All right.
Now you've unlocked the beast.

801
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:33,786
Oh, God!

802
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,593
From this position,
it's relatively easy

803
01:00:36,665 --> 01:00:40,260
- to manipulate your opponent.
- Ohhh!

804
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,968
And thus we have
the chicken wing.

805
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:47,465
The chicken wing.

806
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,272
The arm bar.

807
01:00:50,946 --> 01:00:53,779
The crow bar.
Or my personal favorite...

808
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:57,683
- Ahhhh!
... the pacifier!

809
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,823
Any questions?

810
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,129
Anything you
didn't understand?

811
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,194
Ah. The nipple crippler.

812
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:19,173
This is a useless, not to mention,
shameless move

813
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:23,234
that ultimately is a sure sign
of desperation.

814
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,479
And finally...

815
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:36,850
Pinned!

816
01:01:37,993 --> 01:01:40,086
That was awesome!

817
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:45,929
- Are you okay, Murney?
- Get away from me!

818
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:51,199
Can I get a little help, please?
I can't move my back. Watch the back!

819
01:02:09,725 --> 01:02:11,488
Go!

820
01:02:16,832 --> 01:02:18,527
Sorry!

821
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:23,400
I didn't get that cone!

822
01:02:34,683 --> 01:02:36,412
Crawl!

823
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:54,325
See? But he usually
breaks down the door.

824
01:03:21,196 --> 01:03:25,064
Excellent!
Now do it backwards.

825
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,139
Okay.

826
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,904
- Again.
- Again?

827
01:04:36,972 --> 01:04:40,237
You're going to sleep.
Good night, Peter Panda.

828
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:42,072
Good night, Daddy.

829
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,980
Good night, little fella.

830
01:04:55,357 --> 01:04:57,450
Good night.

831
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:10,671
Hey, Skeever, what do you put in a jar
and shake till they're dead?

832
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:12,969
Fireflies?

833
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:19,144
Go away
and we won't hurt you.

834
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:32,250
Hiya!

835
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:39,460
Don't even think about it.

836
01:05:58,554 --> 01:05:59,714
Cookie!

837
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:03,586
Eat it, you jerk!

838
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:06,127
Go get 'em!

839
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:10,260
Customer service.

840
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,932
From now on, you do things our way!

841
01:06:21,009 --> 01:06:22,738
No highway option!

842
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:25,905
Ah!

843
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,693
- Gary the duck?
- No.

844
01:06:45,767 --> 01:06:47,792
We've been
here two weeks.

845
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,134
This is a matter of national security.

846
01:06:50,205 --> 01:06:54,301
Well, I am sorry, sir, but none
of these answers ring true.

847
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:03,550
Howard. I'm so stupid.

848
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,381
Is it "my angel"?

849
01:07:08,323 --> 01:07:10,223
Yes, it is indeed.

850
01:07:15,964 --> 01:07:19,263
Well, I'll leave you to your business.

851
01:07:24,773 --> 01:07:27,970
Please, Howard,
no more surprises.

852
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:52,657
Zoe, a rookie sniper
could drop you like a deer.

853
01:07:52,734 --> 01:07:56,170
- Good.
- Good?

854
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:59,002
All right,
this is about Scott again.

855
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:02,100
No, it's not.

856
01:08:02,177 --> 01:08:07,308
You were right about him.
Stupid guy.

857
01:08:07,382 --> 01:08:10,874
- So, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

858
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:15,314
Nothing. Okay.

859
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:28,364
You know, when I was little,
my mom left.

860
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:33,340
My dad was a spec ops soldier like me.

861
01:08:33,408 --> 01:08:39,404
When I was eight, he shipped
me off to military school.

862
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:49,120
I guess he liked being a soldier
more than he liked being a dad.

863
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:53,954
One day, I get a letter.

864
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,589
No more dad.

865
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,828
That's terrible.

866
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:06,130
For a long time I thought if I talked
about it, I was letting him down.

867
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:10,076
Like I was supposed to be brave
or something.

868
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:14,912
Yeah.

869
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,987
It's okay to talk
about your dad, Zoe.

870
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:28,789
I do miss him so much.

871
01:09:31,099 --> 01:09:33,329
I don't know, I just...

872
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:36,701
I wanna be strong for Lulu
and Tyler and Peter

873
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:39,332
and Seth and my mom.

874
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:42,343
That's such
a big burden to carry.

875
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,681
I know.

876
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:52,419
I miss him so much.

877
01:09:52,487 --> 01:09:55,650
It's okay to miss your dad.

878
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:03,064
I'll get it.

879
01:10:03,131 --> 01:10:07,199
- Really?
- Yes.

880
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:10,568
Seth! Seth! Guess what?
Mom's coming home.

881
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:13,938
- When?
- Tomorrow! She's coming home tomorrow!

882
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:16,136
- When did you talk?
- Mommy's coming.

883
01:10:16,211 --> 01:10:18,372
Here, buddy,
Mommy's coming home!

884
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,709
Mom's coming home!

885
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:21,339
She is?

886
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:22,906
She's coming back.

887
01:10:25,887 --> 01:10:28,048
Peter,
aren't you excited?

888
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:33,584
- When's she gonna be here?
- So, what are we gonna do?

889
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:37,189
We should dress up nice.
We should make her something.

890
01:10:37,265 --> 01:10:40,462
- We'll clean up the entire house.
- That's a good idea.

891
01:10:40,535 --> 01:10:44,164
- We should make a banner too.
- In the family room.

892
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:06,288
What's wrong, Gary?
Foot got stuck?

893
01:11:07,562 --> 01:11:10,326
Hang on, hang on.

894
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,726
Okay, now just stay still.

895
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:38,425
Hi. Come on in.

896
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:42,054
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, almost.

897
01:11:48,069 --> 01:11:49,934
<i>- Yes?
- Hey, it's Shane.</i>

898
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:52,496
I have excellent news.
I think I found GHOST.

899
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:54,735
<i>- Do you have it?
- It's in a steel vault.</i>

900
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:59,304
It needs some sort of two-pronged key.
I've been working on it, but it's tough.

901
01:11:59,414 --> 01:12:01,882
Great. Good work.
We're on our way.

902
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,943
Don't do anything further.
I'll be there soon.

903
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,578
Yes, sir.

904
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:11,253
Ready?

905
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:14,352
The good news is,
once I give this to my C.O.,

906
01:12:14,429 --> 01:12:17,262
whoever's been bothering you
ain't gonna be.

907
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:19,323
- Really?
- Really.

908
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:23,667
What's wrong? Your mother's
coming. You should be happy.

909
01:12:23,738 --> 01:12:26,639
But, Shane, doesn't that
mean you have to go?

910
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:30,841
You should get ready.
Your mother will be home soon.

911
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:52,698
I had a fight with Zoe before I left,
so they probably trashed the place.

912
01:13:40,248 --> 01:13:41,715
Welcome home, Mom.

913
01:13:43,618 --> 01:13:47,679
Hi! I missed you!

914
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,747
Guy!

915
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:59,563
Shane, I am so proud of you.
I truly am.

916
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:02,569
I am going to give you
your choice of assignment.

917
01:14:02,637 --> 01:14:06,903
Anywhere you want to go,
you just name it.

918
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,739
Well, I appreciate that.

919
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:12,575
But I'll have to think about it.

920
01:14:13,848 --> 01:14:15,509
You're gonna think about it?

921
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:18,553
Well, the military's
all I've ever known.

922
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,555
- I have no regrets.
- I should hope not.

923
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:24,057
It's just that being
with this family...

924
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:26,389
- I've never had a...
- Put your hands up!

925
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:30,923
The Chuns?

926
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:35,267
You gotta be kidding.
I swear I checked them out.

927
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:37,567
Give us the key.

928
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:42,303
- Put your hands up!
- Okay. All right.

929
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:44,242
Here.

930
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:46,741
Now!

931
01:14:52,954 --> 01:14:55,013
You promised us GHOST
months ago!

932
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:58,116
Well, I'm sorry.
There were delays.

933
01:14:58,226 --> 01:14:59,853
Shane!

934
01:14:59,894 --> 01:15:01,794
Stop talking.

935
01:15:01,863 --> 01:15:05,196
Shane's not gonna be
babysitting you anymore.

936
01:15:05,266 --> 01:15:08,861
I trusted you.
Howard trusted you.

937
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:13,965
You've betrayed us
and you've betrayed this country.

938
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,943
Guess what?
North Korea pays better.

939
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:20,209
Chun, watch them.
They're squirmy.

940
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:24,108
You two, come with me.

941
01:16:01,322 --> 01:16:04,314
Did you bring the
stethoscope, Mrs. Chun?

942
01:16:04,392 --> 01:16:07,088
No, but I've
got some C-4.

943
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:19,166
I just had my eyebrows done.

944
01:16:41,696 --> 01:16:43,493
Quiet!

945
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:51,236
I said "Quiet,"
you little bug!

946
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:55,899
Now, Peter!

947
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:56,999
Ah!

948
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:05,946
Hiya!

949
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:08,011
Well, that's cute!

950
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,012
That stuff doesn't hurt!

951
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,783
Shane! You can't do this!
You can't leave a man behind!

952
01:17:41,856 --> 01:17:43,448
Hold on, I got it.

953
01:17:44,592 --> 01:17:45,820
Shane!

954
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:48,328
- Where's Mom?
- Mom?

955
01:17:48,396 --> 01:17:50,364
I'll find her.
You guys run and get help!

956
01:17:50,431 --> 01:17:52,865
Hurry!

957
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,834
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

958
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:57,098
Yes, Lulu. Go, get help.

959
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:03,640
Hold on!

960
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,712
They're headed for the car!

961
01:18:07,782 --> 01:18:10,808
- Zoe, call 911.
- I forgot my cell phone.

962
01:18:10,885 --> 01:18:14,685
- Great. The only time you don't.
- We're gonna be okay!

963
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:27,501
Oh, my God!
What do we do?

964
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:28,797
Find a cop!

965
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:39,638
Ahh!

966
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,324
- He's gaining on us.
- I'll handle it.

967
01:19:20,788 --> 01:19:23,222
Look, Zoe! It's the cops!

968
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:34,993
I assume you heard the Baloney
Bandit has struck again.

969
01:19:35,069 --> 01:19:40,234
I accept total responsibility.
My intelligence, well, it was faulty.

970
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:43,004
If I had better resources...

971
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:56,585
I told you not to pass her
in Driver's Ed.

972
01:19:56,658 --> 01:20:00,353
You have exactly three seconds
to get me through this mine field.

973
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:04,296
- One, two...
- Bill.

974
01:20:04,365 --> 01:20:06,833
She doesn't know.

975
01:20:06,901 --> 01:20:10,166
And you're not taking another
parent away from those kids.

976
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:12,706
Leave the family alone
and I'll get you in.

977
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:14,298
You better not be bluffing.

978
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:22,975
Zoe! Seth!

979
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:26,885
Lulu! Peter! Tyler!

980
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,484
Ah!

981
01:20:31,559 --> 01:20:34,995
That was the code. I saw Mr. Plummer
use it to open the briefcase.

982
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:40,023
You think this is a game?
Code or no code, open it. Now.

983
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:41,966
You can't make him do this.

984
01:20:42,036 --> 01:20:45,369
I know Howard.
You haven't got a chance.

985
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:28,777
Quick like a turtle!
Lie on your back!

986
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:55,300
And that's
the Peter Panda dance.

987
01:21:55,376 --> 01:21:58,436
All right. Go.

988
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:01,413
Yeah, right.

989
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:03,508
Okay, I'll go first.

990
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:15,557
Great work, Shane.
I knew you'd figure it out.

991
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:18,724
I think you'd better open it.

992
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,062
Wait, wait, wait!

993
01:22:24,138 --> 01:22:26,402
Back away.

994
01:22:28,309 --> 01:22:30,277
You open it.

995
01:22:30,344 --> 01:22:32,744
Come on.
I walked the floor first.

996
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:34,975
No way.
You can do it, soldier man.

997
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:36,742
Ah!

998
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:55,829
Ahhh!

999
01:23:09,016 --> 01:23:10,847
Any last words, Shane?

1000
01:23:10,918 --> 01:23:12,977
Say good night,
Peter Panda.

1001
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,757
Shane, are you okay?

1002
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:25,594
Oh!

1003
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:30,403
She was never
a good neighbor.

1004
01:24:01,035 --> 01:24:03,128
Zoe, you're going too fast!

1005
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:05,195
You're not gonna
have time to stop!

1006
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:08,640
Who said anything about
stopping? I'm parking.

1007
01:24:22,089 --> 01:24:26,082
- What are you doing to these kids?
- Hands where I can see them!

1008
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,390
Okay. Calm down.

1009
01:24:28,462 --> 01:24:30,692
Everybody!
Put your weapons down!

1010
01:24:33,534 --> 01:24:35,502
I want the GHOST.

1011
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:46,710
Um... Calm down.
It's just a duck.

1012
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:49,079
- Where's the GHOST?
- I have it.

1013
01:24:51,185 --> 01:24:52,550
Bring it here!

1014
01:24:58,192 --> 01:24:59,591
Put it on the ground.

1015
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:07,861
Now, Gary.
Go for his balls.

1016
01:25:07,935 --> 01:25:11,564
Okay, duck whisperer,
step away!

1017
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:19,541
Gary, now!

1018
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,013
Ah!

1019
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:29,850
Couldn't let you
have all the fun.

1020
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:42,801
So I guess you'll be
taking off now, huh?

1021
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:47,569
Seeing as there's no reason
to stick around anymore.

1022
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:50,509
I'm still here,
aren't I?

1023
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,579
Yeah.

1024
01:25:55,549 --> 01:26:00,111
- What now?
- I don't know. I'm on dry land.

1025
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:01,848
True.

1026
01:26:01,889 --> 01:26:04,414
Which means you're
the superior officer.

1027
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:06,392
True.

1028
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,360
So you tell me.

1029
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:12,222
Um...

1030
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,298
Lulu!

1031
01:26:18,372 --> 01:26:20,704
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could I have a few words?

1032
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:22,538
Sure.

1033
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,305
Well, we... I... You know.

1034
01:26:25,546 --> 01:26:26,979
Oh.

1035
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:31,278
We'll talk later.

1036
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:35,220
- Mission accomplished, soldier.
- I suppose it is.

1037
01:26:35,289 --> 01:26:39,817
- I guess you'll be leaving us now.
- I guess so.

1038
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,830
I want you to have this.

1039
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:50,026
Because I don't want you
ever to forget me.

1040
01:26:53,507 --> 01:26:56,203
I will never forget you.

1041
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:01,147
'Cause you're the
best friend I ever had.

1042
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:04,616
No matter how far...

1043
01:27:04,685 --> 01:27:07,483
...or long life takes me away,

1044
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:10,456
I will always be thinking about you.

1045
01:27:12,526 --> 01:27:14,756
I love you, Shane.

1046
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:18,523
I love you too.

1047
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:31,377
From now on, it's your command.

1048
01:27:34,281 --> 01:27:36,340
At ease, soldiers.

1049
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:40,251
Your father would
be so proud of all of you.

1050
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:45,018
Awww.

1051
01:27:45,092 --> 01:27:46,753
Look who just woke up.

1052
01:27:47,561 --> 01:27:49,586
- Shane?
- Yes?

1053
01:27:49,663 --> 01:27:53,724
- Are we ever gonna see you again?
- What are you talking about?

1054
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:56,292
We still have one more mission.

1055
01:28:34,141 --> 01:28:37,440
Looks like you have
a hit on your hands.

1056
01:28:37,511 --> 01:28:39,638
- You think so?
- Mm-hmm.

1057
01:28:39,713 --> 01:28:43,581
You should take over the drama
department instead of wrestling.

1058
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:47,821
It's gonna be nice
having you around now.

1059
01:28:47,888 --> 01:28:50,413
Now that Murney's found
his true calling.

1060
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:02,160
It's gonna be my pleasure
serving with you.
