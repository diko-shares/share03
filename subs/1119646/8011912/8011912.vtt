{6374}{6469}I'm happy just to have you
{6470}{6565}You're all the love I need somehow
{6566}{6620}It's like a dream

{7946}{7990}(PA) '... 356 to London Heathrow,
{7991}{8062}'all remaining passengers|please make your way... '
{8063}{8136}Harry, I'm not working,|I'm going to my sister's wedding.
{8137}{8203}Customer service|will have to survive without me.
{8204}{8287}But Kat, we've had three delays|and two reps call in sick.
{8288}{8377}And a 2505 on the 8:20 CPT to LGW.
{8378}{8424}And there's this guy on line two
{8425}{8531}who gut stuck with in-laws because|we couldn't get him out of Heathrow.
{8532}{8627}I'd love to help you, sincerely,|but I haven't seen my family in two years
{8628}{8685}and my flight leaves in 15 minutes.
{8697}{8794}Come on, Kat. Please, I'm begging you.
{8874}{8957}Bump the 14:14 to the upper on 16:10.
{8958}{9007}What about line two?
{9039}{9089}Check my bags.
{9090}{9187}I understand, you want your family|to see you the way you see yourself,
{9188}{9250}or would, if you didn't feel|so victimized by them.
{9255}{9315}Hello!
{9316}{9436}We regret that you were inconvenienced.|Unfortunately, we are not liable.
{9478}{9585}But just this once I'll refund your ticket|and credit you 10,000 frequent flyer miles.
{9586}{9645}Thank you for calling Virgin Atlantic.
{9891}{9945}Your first trip?
{10025}{10103}My sister's getting married|and the best man is my ex.
{10104}{10182}If I chicken out,|I wanna know where the exits are.
{10362}{10417}I'm not a knuckler, I fly all the time.
{10418}{10472}The reason I can't feel my legs
{10473}{10549}is that any second|my date is gonna sit down in 3B
{10550}{10605}and I need him to look really good today.
{10634}{10682}Hello, 3B.
{10929}{10969}Thank you.
{11054}{11093}Hey.
{11094}{11137}Kat.
{11248}{11285}Let's sit.
{11538}{11586}I'm glad you found it OK.
{11605}{11657}The airport... The plane, I mean.
{11677}{11798}I'm sorry we couldn't leave sooner. I know you|wanted to get settled before the party.
{11799}{11847}Work must be crazy.
{12112}{12165}Oh, I should warn you.
{12166}{12246}You know those families|where everyone's out of their mind
{12247}{12304}but they're your family so you love them?
{12305}{12344}Mine's not like that.
{12660}{12719}I love my dad.
{12720}{12812}But since he's my stepdad,|he's technically not family.
{12813}{12852}He's more like a hostage.
{13022}{13061}(Snores)
{13170}{13209}'Ladies and gentlemen,
{13210}{13297}'we will shortly be arriving|at London Heathrow.
{13298}{13354}'On arrival, please remain seated
{13355}{13440}'until the seat belt sign|has been switched off.
{13441}{13508}'Local time is 4:22pm
{13509}{13557}'and the temperature is a warm 21... '
{13558}{13597}Good morning.
{13598}{13673}'That's 72 degrees Fahreneit.
{13674}{13739}'We would like to thank you|for flying with us today
{13740}{13805}'and look forward to seeing you again soon.'
{13907}{13933}Oh.
{13998}{14083}Nick, please tell me|you're not wearing that tonight.
{14084}{14141}I am.
{14142}{14274}It's no big deal really, it just looks like|a tailor made your tie out of my dress.
{14275}{14418}Don't get me wrong - matching's fine.|It's matchy-matchy you wanna look out for.
{14442}{14515}- We look like we're trying too hard.|- Exactly.
{14516}{14605}I want us to look like we fit|but not like we're trying to look like we fit.
{14606}{14654}Let me teach you a trick.
{14655}{14755}If you look people in the eye,|they'll never notice what you're wearing.
{14756}{14831}(Kat) There's no way I'm showing up|in his and her outfits
{14832}{14909}so if you're gonna wear that tie,|I have to change my dress.
{14910}{14980}Driver, will you please|pull over somewhere?
{15138}{15217}(Kat) I'm sorry. I promise this is the last one.
{15218}{15281}You must think...|Who knows what you think?
{15282}{15342}(Nick) I know how important this is for you.
{15342}{15441}But remember, you're a beautiful woman|and you've got everything going for you.
{15442}{15483}(Kat) Don't patronize me.
{15502}{15574}I feel like crap but I wanna look hot doing it.
{15652}{15710}Mission accomplished.
{15710}{15746}Really?
{15766}{15823}Don't get too attached.
{16005}{16053}I prefer the red one.
{16082}{16133}I'll let her know.
{16226}{16261}Hmm...
{16262}{16332}"Hmm, nice dress," or "Hmm...
{16333}{16395}"Gorgeous. I was insane to let you go"?
{16428}{16486}Well, I'd shag you.
{16486}{16532}If that's all right with you?
{16718}{16757}(Gentle piano)
{16790}{16835}I don't know if I can do this.
{16836}{16935}Well, you can never be sure of anything|but we still have to go inside.
{17174}{17247}- Aunt Bea!|- Dear girl.
{17248}{17318}This should have been you getting married.
{17319}{17396}You know, you didn't have|to return the gravy boat.
{17397}{17473}And to think Jeffrey is the best man.
{17474}{17520}Have you met Nick?
{17521}{17569}- How do you do?|- Oh.
{17594}{17641}Charming.
{17642}{17681}And what do you do?
{17714}{17745}Excuse us.
{17878}{17929}What a nightmare.
{18022}{18061}OK, we need a story.
{18062}{18169}You're a therapist, we just started dating and|you're crazy about me.
{18226}{18281}Count it. 6,000 even.
{18282}{18370}- Oh, I trust you.|- No. Count it.
{18464}{18504}All right.
{18688}{18792}I'll cover expenses but if you want|to be intimate, we talk money first.
{18793}{18888}That won't be an issue. I find the idea|of sex for money morally repugnant.
{18913}{18987}I'm sorry. No offense.
{19033}{19085}Do me a favor, quit apologizing.
{19086}{19161}If you look at this as a business transaction,
{19162}{19227}maybe you won't|feel compelled to keep saying sorry.
{19228}{19264}I'm sorry.
{19265}{19305}It's also really annoying.
{19656}{19693}Sorry.
{19694}{19771}- Sorry.|- Pussy Kat! What happened to you?
{19772}{19880}- Pull over for a quickie?|- Mom, this is so not the time to be yourself.
{19897}{19944}And who might this be?
{19945}{20010}Hi. I'm the new guy.|It's great to meet you.
{20011}{20095}Lovely. This is a marathon, not a sprint.
{20096}{20145}We've got welcome cocktails today
{20146}{20225}then tomorrow's Young People In The Park|and Stags And Hens.
{20226}{20380}Friday's the picnic, then the rehearsal dinner|and since you have left no margin for jetlag,
{20381}{20431}I need you to hydrate.
{20556}{20621}- Dad.|- My darling.
{20663}{20723}- Meet Nick.|- Professor Ellis.
{20724}{20780}- How do you do?|- Kat?
{20802}{20874}- Kat! Oooh! I'm getting married! Oh, Kitty!|- Hey!
{20874}{20911}Oh, I missed you so much.
{20912}{20982}Gosh, who's the hunky, huh? Nice.
{20983}{21045}There you are! Get over here!
{21083}{21166}At times like these,|I find a good, stiff drink helps.
{21167}{21239}- Can I get you a refill, sir?|- Very kind of you.
{21263}{21310}Where did you find him?
{21310}{21352}Thank you.
{21383}{21423}Yellow Pages.
{21424}{21466}(Glass clinking)
{21467}{21517}- (Mrs. Ellis) Hello!|- (Feedback)
{21585}{21651}Sweet Jesus.|Who gave that woman an amp?
{21652}{21705}Hello. Hello?
{21706}{21782}Oh. Wonderful. It's finally working.
{21783}{21889}Does everybody have a drink?|Because I am going to say a few words.
{21890}{21955}(Quiet, then loud)|Welcome, friends and family...
{21956}{22015}- (Applause)|- I'm...
{22029}{22088}Victor and I are so happy
{22089}{22159}that you're here to celebrate with us
{22160}{22266}as we welcome Edward and|the Fletcher-Wootens into our family.
{22266}{22377}We always thought that|we would marry off Kat first.
{22378}{22493}We had good reason to hope because|she was so popular with the boys at school
{22494}{22541}and we came pretty close once,
{22542}{22624}but, as you all know,|that crashed and burned.
{22642}{22725}Luckily, we were able|to get the deposit back,
{22726}{22811}- so here we are again...|- (Piano chords)
{22899}{22947}To the bride and groom.
{22969}{23090}Oh. Yes. Yes. Well, back|to the bride and groom to be.
{23118}{23173}Um...
{23174}{23323}Edward, we are so glad that|you fell in love with the girl next door.
{23324}{23392}Our Amy. Congratulations, babies.
{23393}{23457}- (AIl) Congratulations.|- (Applause)
{23773}{23799}Jeffrey.
{23815}{23885}Hello. Kat-mandu.
{24204}{24256}Wow, you look gorgeous.
{24292}{24331}Gorgeous.
{24332}{24388}(Woman) Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
{24389}{24482}Oh, my God, oh, my God,|oh, my God, oh, my God! Top Kat! Ooooh!
{24482}{24589}Where the bloody hell have you been?|I have gynecologists that call more often.
{24590}{24701}- You have more than one?|- I play them off against each other.
{24702}{24801}Hello, arsehole.|Since you dumped my cousin brutally,
{24802}{24859}you won't mind if I steal her away, will you?
{24860}{24909}Thanks.
{25046}{25127}- You didn't have to do that.|- I wasrt saving you from him,
{25128}{25177}I was saving you from yourself.
{25178}{25253}You, my love, are too bloody nice.
{25288}{25375}I've never seen so many|beautiful women in one room.
{25376}{25410}Did he bring a date?
{25410}{25482}Darling, why waste time on that horse's arse
{25482}{25568}when Mr. Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down|is waiting for you over there?
{25569}{25626}- What does he do?|- He's a therapist.
{25652}{25730}- The perils of paranoia.|- Yes.
{25731}{25785}Oh, God. I think I've just come.
{25970}{26002}Thank you.
{26003}{26051}Can I have that?
{26204}{26244}Hm.
{26359}{26416}(Muffled) Thank you.
{26417}{26475}You know what I love about all this, Kat?
{26476}{26545}There's finally a reason for|the world to revolve around you?
{26546}{26589}Exactly.
{26654}{26723}- There you are.|- How's the future missus?
{26724}{26777}I'm perfect, I'm all ginny.
{26778}{26835}Thanks, Snufflepop.
{26929}{26987}Mmm! Mm-mm-mm!
{27021}{27060}Wow!
{27061}{27129}Am I not the luckiest bastard on earth?
{27130}{27221}Aw! Well, I'll dance to that.
{27258}{27306}- Oh!|- Oh, Jesus!
{27353}{27422}That's what he gets|for not taking dance lessons
{27423}{27483}until two days before the wedding.
{27484}{27553}Who's ever heard of|dance lessons for a wedding?
{27554}{27612}Just about everyone.
{27613}{27657}You are taking the piss?
{27658}{27697}We'll go with you.
{27698}{27769}I don't even know you, hunky dunky,|and I love you already.
{27789}{27889}(Ed) Dance lessons? Hm. Right.
{28104}{28190}- Hey.|- Oh. Hello.
{28301}{28382}Weddings are a celebration|of love and commitment...
{28383}{28423}in Utopia.
{28424}{28521}In the real world they're an excuse to drink|excessively and say things you shouldn't.
{28522}{28622}- A philosopher, huh?|- Well, shrink.
{28623}{28675}- Crikey!|- What?
{28676}{28724}- No, nothing.|- No, tell me.
{28743}{28796}Well, you Yanks and your therapy,
{28797}{28874}it's a load of touchy-feely mumbo jumbo.
{28898}{28980}Spilling your guts to a total stranger,|it's not natural.
{28981}{29027}(Laughter)
{29063}{29111}Oh, God.
{29147}{29183}It's just...
{29184}{29301}There's this girl that I care for...|Well, I suppose you could say I love her.
{29333}{29412}The bugger is,|she's here with some other guy.
{29413}{29453}There you are.
{29486}{29543}Hey, Kat. Hey, Kat.
{29544}{29607}Oh, hey, yourself. I see you met my ex.
{29685}{29749}- I was just telling him how we met.|- Mm.
{29799}{29847}- The Knicks game.|- Oh, yes.
{29848}{29892}Yeah... Oh.
{29893}{29931}You hate sport.
{29932}{29991}- I hate cricket.|- Right, yes.
{30036}{30100}Well, I should go and... go.
{30183}{30231}He looks miserable.
{30252}{30334}- What were you talking about?|- He seems a little drunk
{30335}{30402}but I think he's still crazy about you.
{30403}{30462}- Do I know you from somewhere?|- No.
{30505}{30552}What did he say? You don't...
{30586}{30633}You don't think he wants me back?
{30638}{30674}(Texas: When We Are Together)
{30675}{30725}Love started making sense
{30726}{30826}I always make mistakes at my expense
{30827}{30920}Love has placed a seed
{30921}{31017}And you're the sun|that shines down upon me
{31018}{31111}Yeah, when we are together
{31112}{31154}And when we are apart
{31155}{31209}Are you OK?
{31260}{31320}- Here we are.|- Thank God!

{31512}{31552}(Breathing heavily)
{31598}{31715}- Thanks again for having me.|- Don't be silly. It's wonderful to meet you.
{31716}{31802}Although technically,|I never knew you existed.
{31803}{31883}- Come on, Bunny.|- I love surprises.
{31899}{31955}Where's Nick sleeping?
{31956}{32066}My mother has this rule about sharing|when there's no ring involved...
{32067}{32126}- Don't be silly.|- What?
{32126}{32225}I am not as small-town|as my daughter seems to think.
{32288}{32315}(Giggling)
{32640}{32680}Sorry about this.
{32681}{32758}I went through a painfully|earnest floral phase.
{32916}{32964}Air Supply?
{33050}{33144}Oh. My parents had a German|exchange student a few years back.
{33170}{33218}He must have left it here.
{33359}{33405}Everyone knows their greatest hits.
{33406}{33485}Some of their lesser-known ballads|are surprisingly poignant.
{33617}{33657}(Squeaking)
{33790}{33919}Is that an old habit from ballet class|or from a lifetime of walking on eggshells?
{34062}{34102}I never took ballet.
{34301}{34340}How'd you know that was me?
{34465}{34513}I have a friend at the magazine.
{34538}{34589}So much for anonymity.
{34590}{34664}Go ahead, take a look.|It's part of the package.
{34665}{34709}(Laughs)
{34793}{34853}I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous.
{34880}{34948}I never thought anything like this|could happen to me.
{34949}{34996}This happened to you?
{35020}{35118}It happened in the sense that|I picked up the phone, tracked you down,
{35119}{35191}flew you over her and gave you $6,000.
{35405}{35493}- Will you grab my shampoo, please?|- Shampoo! Got it.
{35601}{35714}(Nick) I'm all out love,|I'm so lost without you
{35715}{35819}I know you were right,|believing for so long
{35820}{35946}I'm all out of love,|what am I without you?
{35947}{36097}I can't be too late|to say that I was so wrong
{36098}{36138}(Clears throat)
{36191}{36290}The part where you were|a sexual surrogate and then started to...
{36318}{36365}branch out, is...
{36389}{36453}Is that really how it happened?
{36454}{36555}The real story -|my mother was a hippie, and a stripper.
{36581}{36633}She was insanely inappropriate with me,
{36634}{36715}she washed her lingerie|in my bath water while I was still in it.
{36716}{36756}Oh.
{36757}{36852}So as an adult, I needed to find ways|to experience intimacy and sex
{36854}{36925}- but with rules that couldn't be violated.|- Wow.
{36974}{37026}I'm just screwing with you.
{37061}{37111}You shit.
{37158}{37200}OK, this part.
{37201}{37261}You say, and I quote,
{37262}{37337}"Every woman has|the exact love life she wants."
{37338}{37393}That seems a broad generalization... Oh!
{37656}{37696}Oh.
{37718}{37834}Do you honestly believe that|I want to be single and miserable?
{37835}{37935}Do you think that I want to be hung up|on some guy who led me on for years
{37936}{38006}and out of the blue shattered my heart?
{38006}{38104}First of all, there's no such thing|as out of the blue.
{38105}{38164}And second of all, yeah.

{38510}{38558}how did he sound?
{38558}{38637}Like a harmless, self-absorbed toolbox.
{38638}{38689}Seriously.
{38707}{38760}He sounded tormented.
{38846}{38893}Tormented? How?
{38905}{38945}Like he's...
{38956}{39025}jealous that I'm here|with someone else, or like...
{39062}{39139}he regrets throwing away|our life together?
{39376}{39424}It's just that...
{39444}{39544}this hasn't really turned out|the way that I thought it would.
{39700}{39745}Hey, Nick.

{75186}{75292}I'm majoring in comparative literature|at Brown. I hate anchovies.
{75336}{75408}I think I'd miss you|even if we'd never met.
{75587}{75633}Come on!
{75762}{75849}(Ed) I'm a little concerned...|I'm just... It makes me nervous...
{75850}{75934}(TJ) You know, I might just call you.
{75952}{76050}But if I did, I would lose,|because my hand is complete shite.
{76051}{76086}Ohhh.
{76136}{76169}- I'm in.|- Come on.
{76170}{76225}There's gotta be something wrong with him.
{76226}{76308}I bet his thingy bends, doesn't it?|Got a little kink in it.
{76309}{76383}Oh, no, don't tell me.|It's bloody perfect.
{76402}{76465}I'm going to see you.
{76511}{76566}Looky, looky here.
{76567}{76626}A full house.
{76627}{76678}Oh-ho-ho!
{76679}{76775}Has anyone seen my future wife?|She'll kill me if I don't serve her first.
{76776}{76860}Have you guys ever had|a real honest-to-God fight, ever?
{76861}{76921}- Yes, of course.|- Yeah, right.
{76922}{77021}Well, apparently,|makeup sex is the best kind.
{77022}{77069}Not that I'm ever going to find out.
{77070}{77134}- Give me that!|- (Shouting)
{77135}{77187}- Come on!|- No, no!
{77188}{77236}- Don't!|- Come on!
{77237}{77301}(Shouting and laughter)
{77349}{77413}You seem to have a way with women.
{77430}{77513}Why don't you go and rustle up the bride? Get|her to join the party.
{77610}{77694}(Amy) Why are you bringing this up now?|I love Ed.
{77695}{77770}- What do you want from me?|- I want you to tell me...
{77866}{77953}Blue shirt or... white shirt|for the, er, rehearsal dinner?
{78086}{78126}Sorry to interrupt.
{78156}{78215}Your dad sent me.
{78216}{78264}What for?
{78286}{78338}To make sure you're OK.
{78470}{78534}Kat, could I have a word?|It'll only take a moment.
{78535}{78641}Let me think. You stole seven years of|her life with your bullshit and your charm
{78642}{78687}and now you'd like just a moment?
{78688}{78749}Sure. Go right ahead.
{78853}{78950}Thanks for the solidarity, Mum,|but next time a little less information.
{78989}{79047}Do you believe a place has a memory?
{79048}{79189}Even before Ed and I started dating,|we all used to come up here in the summer
{79190}{79238}and spend weekends.
{79461}{79528}God, I hope it doesn't remember everything.
{79575}{79641}No matter how certain|one is of one's position
{79642}{79694}of what one should or shouldn't do,
{79695}{79747}one sometimes discovers
{79748}{79861}that one is not as one would have|hoped one would have been.
{79874}{79957}- What exactly are you trying to say?|- I'm sorry.
{79958}{80044}Look, I feel like I need to tell you something.
{80046}{80131}- You're not even listening.|- I'm sorry. I'll be back in a minute.
{80297}{80372}Hey, is everything OK?
{80455}{80503}Yeah.
{80556}{80595}Yeah.
{80723}{80771}(Victor) Anchovy, Nick?
{80772}{80824}I remember the day I met Kat.
{80825}{80872}It was in New York.
{80874}{80925}I'd been seeing Bunny for a few months
{80926}{81039}and she finally trusted me|enough to meet her kid.
{81040}{81189}So I'm over at her place|and in walks this little monster.
{81226}{81282}That was it. I was a goner.
{81311}{81359}That was the day I became a dad.
{81390}{81494}You know, Nick, you think it's going|to get easier as they get older,
{81495}{81567}that you're going to worry about them less.
{81596}{81683}Or that you're going to trust the world more.
{81703}{81755}But that's just not how it happens.
{82040}{82115}This may not make much sense to you, sir,
{82116}{82208}but I'd like to ask your permission|to date your daughter.
{82269}{82317}I thought you already were.
{82498}{82545}(Cheering and laughter)
{82686}{82815}- I blame... I blame Tony Peepants.|- No.
{82816}{82859}Let's have the story. Kat, come on.
{82860}{82949}- No.|- I have to initiate Nick into our family.
{82950}{83091}I blame Tony for why my two girls|just don't seem to be able to get along.
{83104}{83193}Don't deny it. You barely tolerate each other.
{83194}{83298}Come on. It's true. The only thing you've got in|common is you're both attracted to me.
{83299}{83342}It started after we moved here.
{83343}{83462}My two girls got into a fight over Tony|Peepants and have never made up since.
{83463}{83519}Apparently, Kat and I were inseparable.
{83520}{83582}If Kat ate a banana, Amy threw it up.
{83583}{83632}If Amy threw it up, Kat ate it.
{83634}{83665}(AII groaning)
{83665}{83778}So we were eating|and throwing up together in harmony
{83779}{83838}until Tony walked me home|from school one day.
{83839}{83873}He was my first boyfriend.
{83874}{83945}Tony ignored Kat|because he wanted to play with me.
{83946}{84047}Anyway, the point of the story is that|Tony ended up with a chair in his face.
{84048}{84123}It was plastic and child-sized.
{84147}{84278}- As I recall, there were stitches involved.|- Come on, Bunny, 15 stitches.
{84279}{84338}So is that when he peed in his pants?
{84339}{84397}He cried a lot,|but there was no peeing.
{84398}{84475}So what's with the nickname?
{84572}{84627}I have absolutely no idea.
{84697}{84745}Let me get some more wine.
{84768}{84821}(TJ) Would you marry me if I asked?
{84822}{84877}That was a yes. Did you see that?
{84884}{84918}(Laughter)
{85140}{85241}And you know, I thought perhaps you...|Bollocks. Sorry.
{85258}{85374}I had no idea this would be so difficult.|I just feel like I owe you an explanation.
{85375}{85433}Relax, relax. It's fine.
{85456}{85504}I promise.
{85562}{85668}And I should probably admit that...
{85714}{85808}I brought Nick with me to torture you, slowly,
{85809}{85856}for the entire weekend.
{85877}{85982}But then, I don't know,|something happened and now...
{85983}{86097}I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings|but I'm just sick of you and me.
{86117}{86255}Of our whole story, so come on,|let's just go upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
{86341}{86397}I slept with your sister.
{86631}{86740}- I'm sorry?|- Well, I shagged Amy, two years ago.
{86741}{86809}That's why I broke it off with you.
{86810}{86939}And then after you left,|sod it, we kept at it like rabbits,
{86940}{87063}until we both realized it was absolutely mad|and, obviously, morally wrong.
{87121}{87193}And then that was it.
{87193}{87323}But last Christmas, when Ed proposed,
{87324}{87414}I realized... I'm in love with her.
{87557}{87616}Good Lord, say something, please.
{88002}{88061}Oh, my God, he's told you, hasn't he?
{88081}{88164}- You knew?|- Kat, I'm so sorry. I'm so...
{88406}{88465}Kat. Kat, please.
{88465}{88521}Kat, please don't say anything.
{88630}{88671}I can't believe you told her.
{89117}{89157}(Thunder)
{89447}{89500}What's going on?
{89501}{89548}Nothing.
{89591}{89633}It doesn't look like nothing.
{89658}{89719}Now is not the time to catch on, Ed.
{89775}{89845}OK. Good.
{90044}{90097}(Thunder)
{90156}{90228}Leave me alone.|You knew and you didn't tell me.
{90230}{90313}- Wait up.|- I can't believe I trusted you.
{90314}{90365}Come on. You've got to stop running.
{90366}{90455}- How could you not have told me?|- What did you expect me to say?
{90474}{90536}You let me make a fool of myself.
{90537}{90653}You lied to me, but I guess I shouldn't be|surprised because that's what you do.
{90653}{90704}That's who you are. You're a liar.
{90731}{90793}You're judging me? That's a good one.
{90794}{90854}You're going to point a finger at me,
{90855}{90951}the guy that you hired|to pretend to be your boyfriend?
{90952}{91062}You're right. I was so desperate|to make everyone believe that I was happy
{91063}{91128}that I paid $6,000 for a lie.
{91129}{91241}And, at the end of the day, the only one|who ended up falling for it was me.
{91264}{91314}I wish I could say it was won'th it.
{91353}{91415}Go ahead, Kat, hate me.
{91435}{91533}I think you're running out of steam|on this whole Jeffrey thing anyhow.
{91534}{91657}Maybe now you'll be able to hold on to this|long enough to ruin your next relationship.
{91993}{92077}- Nick.|- I'm just checking into a hotel.
{92078}{92139}Don't be ridiculous. It's late.
{92163}{92211}Take the car.
{92378}{92454}Actually, the boathouse is empty.
{92485}{92592}Look, I don't know what's going on with|you two but I'm sure you'll work it out.
{92689}{92809}You couldn't be more perfect|if she'd picked you out of a catalog.
{92932}{92980}Thanks, Ed.
{93014}{93054}(Knocking)
{93225}{93265}Hey.
{93345}{93383}Hey.
{93461}{93601}I just... I wanted to say thank you|for not outing me in front of Ed.
{93669}{93775}I want to tell him,|just not the night before our wedding.
{93776}{93856}You know, with these things,|timing is everything.
{94076}{94124}You're right.
{94148}{94189}You should time it right,
{94201}{94312}so that when he hears that|you repeatedly screwed his best friend,
{94314}{94396}he won't feel like the world is collapsing|and there's no escape
{94397}{94474}because you tricked him into marrying you.
{94647}{94722}- Kat...|- Don't worry. Your wedding will be perfect.
{94723}{94845}Tomorrow I'll say all the right things|and you'll deal with Ed when you're ready.
{94846}{94959}But right now, tonight,|I'm not going to pretend it's OK.

{98063}{98107}Hello.
{98175}{98223}I've been looking for you.
{98341}{98404}So, why did you let him go?
{98549}{98611}- It's complicated, Dad.|- Right.
{98612}{98682}It probably wouldn't have|worked out anyway, huh?
{98801}{98914}I remember reading a fascinating article|in the New York Times Magazine once,
{98915}{98974}where this guy said,
{98975}{99088}"Every woman has|the exact love life she wants."
{99124}{99186}You know what? I agree with him.
{99217}{99300}But I refuse to believe|that this is what you want, Kat.
{99324}{99381}Ever since you were little,
{99382}{99466}you've always worried|about what other people think.
{99491}{99607}Now, come on. What do you think?|Is he the guy for you?
{99777}{99812}Then go and get him.
{100493}{100577}Hello, darling. Your mother said|you wanted to have a quick word.
{100578}{100626}No, no, no, I...
{100736}{100820}There's something|you should know before you marry me.
{100821}{100850}What is it?
{102068}{102140}I wanted to tell you|but I was afraid you'd never forgive me
{102141}{102197}and I just... I love you so much.
{102217}{102271}I'm sorry.
{102272}{102421}I knew you were seeing someone else|when we finally got together, but not Jeffrey.
{102471}{102529}Does Kat know?
{102561}{102609}Jeffrey told her last night.
{102741}{102785}Excuse me.
{102977}{103017}(Jeffrey) Ed?
{103121}{103193}Ed... Calm down, Ed.

{103603}{103701}Ed, calm down!|It's all sorted! She wants you!
{103702}{103765}I've given up! What's the problem?

{103819}{103909}That's not fair.|It was before you guys were even dating.
{103910}{103989}But you were engaged to her sister.
{103989}{104054}Ed, calm down!
{104081}{104165}We can talk about this|like civilized human beings.
{104337}{104396}I look like a total wanker, don't I?

{104717}{104740}Whoa!
{104968}{105061}(Ed) I trust you've enjoyed|your trip to England.
{105061}{105125}Yeah, it was fantastic.|Thanks, Eddie.
{105192}{105261}You know, I felt sorry|for you last night.
{105285}{105404}I was just sitting there like some smug arse,|thinking, "Arert I a lucky sod?"
{105449}{105580}I forgave her when I thought|it was just some random bloke.
{105630}{105678}But not Jeffrey.
{105758}{105822}I've had her up on a pedestal ever since...
{105921}{105977}ever since I put her up there.
{106021}{106072}What a mess I've made, huh?
{106366}{106414}I'm so sorry.
