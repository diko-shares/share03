2
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.280
I'm so happy you picked
this dress, Veruca!

3
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.360
You look beautiful. Doesn't she?

4
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.800
You guys, I'm getting married!

5
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.600
I'm getting married!

6
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.280
Not without your
veil, you're not.

7
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.720
Where is that bad boy?

8
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.080
Oh, I think I left it upstairs.

9
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.920
Don't worry. I'll get it,

10
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.680
sis.

11
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.360
She is so annoying.

12
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.040
And so ugly.

13
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960
She looks like Karl Malden.

14
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.280
I know, and she's gonna be

15
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.360
my sister-in-law in an hour!

16
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.160
How are you
gonna deal with that?

17
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.240
I'm just gonna lay
down the law for Danny.

18
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.800
We're seeing his goofy family
as little as possible.

19
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.510
You sure he's gonna
go along with that?

20
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.640
Danny doesn't say no to me.

21
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.880
Believe me, I have
him well-trained.

22
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
So, tell us, what happened
with Eric last night?

23
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.520
So, I told him if he wanted
to stop the wedding,

24
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.160
he had to speak now or
forever hold his peace.

25
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.680
And what'd he say?

26
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.240
He said he's never
gonna settle down,

27
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.000
and I should just go
ahead and marry Danny.

28
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.080
Did he give you a
wedding present, huh?

29
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.480
You're so horny! Yeah.

30
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.240
I guess you could call it that.

31
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.680
You're so bad!

32
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.840
It's the last time, I swear.

33
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.160
Yeah, right!

34
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.680
Danny is so sweet
and considerate.

35
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.760
And he's gonna be
a cardiologist.

36
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.680
So, I'm marrying him

37
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.680
and that zucchini in the
middle of his face.

38
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.400
His parents are
disgusting, too!

39
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.320
Close your eyes
when he's on top!

40
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.240
And your thighs!

41
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.040
Cuz, I'm so sorry.

42
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.840
Yikes, that hurt.

43
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.800
That was me, Danny
Maccabee, 20 years ago.

44
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.960
Pathetic, huh?

45
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.280
So, I'm halfway done
boozing away my sorrows,

46
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.040
when something pretty
interesting happened.

47
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.280
Oh, baby, you're
like a Pop Tart,

48
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.360
hot and sweet!

49
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.560
Hey, mami!

50
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.400
You must play the
trumpet or something,

51
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.640
'cause you're making me
feel all horny and stuff!

52
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.280
You dropped your purse.

53
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.840
Can I just sit for 10 seconds

54
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.160
and not get hit on? Thank you.

55
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.920
I was just letting you know
you dropped your purse.

56
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.240
- I'm sorry. I thought...
- That's fine, that's fine.

57
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.910
I'm sure you didn't meet the
lady who gave you that ring

58
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.720
in a meat market like this.

59
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.440
School cafeteria.

60
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.560
How long you been married?

61
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.480
I was gonna tell her,
I really was.

62
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.520
But I didn't want her to
know what a loser I was,

63
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.160
so I stretched the
truth a little.

64
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.320
Six years.

65
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.160
Where's your wife tonight?

66
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.240
I stopped asking that
question a long time ago.

67
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.040
That's terrible.

68
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.800
My wife says I work too much.

69
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.320
Trying to provide for her,
her shopping addiction,

70
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.800
and crack.

71
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.640
Why don't you just leave her?

72
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.600
The children.

73
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.440
All 14 of them.

74
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.000
I just, I like to adopt,

75
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.440
and I don't wanna
stop doing that.

76
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.640
You poor guy.

77
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.800
You wanna get outta here?

78
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.760
And so I discovered

79
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.680
the power of the wedding ring.

80
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.440
The symbol of my humiliation

81
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.960
had become a tool to
get back on the horse.

82
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.800
Are you kidding me?
Snuffleupagus!

83
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.400
I switched my specialty from
cardiology to plastic surgery,

84
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.320
got rid of the big honker,

85
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.880
and the ring became my thing.

86
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.320
I just assumed after we got married
she'd stop hooking, but...

87
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.120
You need to put this wedding
band on a true heart.

88
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.720
This is a good moment.

89
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.520
Yeah. Should we go make it last,

90
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.720
for a while, somewhere?

91
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.800
Okay, let's go. To your dorm.

92
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.680
Sometimes I think about

93
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.320
throwing the ring
into the ocean.

94
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.880
I know how wrong it is.
But I can't.

95
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.080
It's my Precious.

96
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.760
Besides, being fake married

97
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.480
is the perfect way to make sure

98
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.520
I never get my heart
broken again.

99
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.360
What are these?

100
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.760
Boobie bags.

101
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.080
The women, they stick them
in their flat chesties,

102
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.160
make them big.

103
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.200
These are not the boobie
bags that I ordered.

104
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.560
What is that?

105
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.280
It's like a syrup
dispenser at an IHOP.

106
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.440
I don't know what that is.

107
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.240
Come on. These, they
don't feel like these.

108
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.040
No... Seriously?

109
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.360
I just trying to learn.

110
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.320
Listen, Dr. Maccabee would
never accept subpar boobs.

111
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.200
Would you please just
get me what I ordered

112
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.840
and tell Omar that I would like a
discount for the inconvenience?

113
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.880
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, Simon.

114
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.440
- My 4:00 here?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.000
Room one, Kirsten Brant.
Don't laugh.

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.800
Well, I, uh... I had
bad plastic surgery.

117
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.961
Should've known this
doctor was a quack.

118
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.960
His office was in,
like, a warehouse.

119
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.160
I see, I see.

120
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.320
Questions?

121
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.480
No, no. Just, please
help me, Doctor.

122
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.880
Absolutely. It's usually easier

123
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.640
to do these things right
the first time, but...

124
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.600
What? You seem dubious.

125
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.680
Hmm?

126
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.200
Oh, no, not at all.

127
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.720
I mean, I hear you're the best,
Dr. Maccabee.

128
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.000
I don't know about that,

129
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.920
but I think we can figure
something out here.

130
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.780
Relax, relax.

131
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.900
That's relaxed? Hmm.

132
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.860
Here, let me just pull
it down for a sec.

133
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.260
And I let go. Okay, shoots right
back up there.

134
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.180
- I'm sorry.
- Oh. Sorry about what?

135
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.940
Oh, my God! It's just...

136
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.140
That just really
went right up there.

137
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.060
That was high.
You gotta watch that.

138
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.140
It's gonna get
caught in your hair.

139
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.900
I don't know, maybe I should
just keep it like this.

140
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.340
It seems to make
other people happy.

141
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.820
No. But, seriously, are you available
for my kid's birthday party?

142
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.540
That's too much.
I'm sorry!

143
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.660
Let me give you a hug.

144
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.620
That's what you need first.
We'll fix this.

145
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.980
Mmm.

146
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.460
Oh, God! Okay, I gotta...

147
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.060
I'm gonna excuse myself.
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.820
Ding-dong!

149
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.700
Eddie's here. Hey. My cousin.

150
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.100
Oh.

151
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.500
Oh, my gosh.

152
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.660
Brows gone wild over here.

153
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.980
I'm actually digging it.

154
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.130
And what are you doing later?

155
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.180
Oh!

156
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.580
Oh, sorry, I'm kind of seeing anybody else.
There you go.

157
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.300
Oh, browch.

158
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.580
My gosh.

159
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.210
Look, I don't know
who you're seeing,

160
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.540
but whoever they are,

161
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.580
they don't have what this guy's got
down there, you know what I mean?

162
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.940
All right, Eddie.

163
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.980
Yeah, it's a very good one.
I should know, I installed it.

164
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.580
Oh, you had a
penile enlargement?

165
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.940
Yes.

166
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.700
People really do that?
That is hilarious!

167
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.380
See you on the 28th,
Dr. Maccabee!

168
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.100
Dude, why are you telling
everybody about my surgery?

169
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.980
Am I hiding the
secrets around here?

170
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.730
You don't think Katherine
knows about this?

171
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.420
Katherine was in the
room when I did that.

172
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.060
She held the magnifying glass.

173
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.780
I did. And the tweezer.

174
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.220
Real nice.

175
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.820
Did you get a chance
to try it out yet?

176
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.980
Uh, yeah. I've banged it up.

177
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.220
It's got a couple dents.
I'm not gonna lie.

178
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.260
- Yeah.
- You did?

179
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.140
Not from a human.

180
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.900
It's got... From
this doll I made.

181
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.420
Oh.

182
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.980
Hey, Adon. Yo, yo.

183
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.420
Danny! I am so happy
you could be here!

184
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.410
- How are you, baby?
- Did you bring any Botox?

185
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.700
I didn't bring the Botox.
I brought my cousin, Eddie.

186
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.340
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

187
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.780
Is this a Halloween party?

188
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.500
Are you kidding me right now?

189
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.020
You got a little
more work done, huh?

190
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.060
Yeah, just a little bit,
just tweaking, tweaking.

191
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.460
Maintenance, maintenance.

192
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.700
I just wanna stay
in the game, Danny.

193
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.300
I don't wanna hit home runs,
just some singles. That's all.

194
00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.170
You gotta stop, though,
I'm telling you.

195
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.660
Do you have any
feeling in your face?

196
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.700
Just in this one
spot right here.

197
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.660
And then from the eyebrows
down, dead, dead.

198
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.460
Is that a car alarm?

199
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.540
- He's laughing, he's laughing.
- Oh, okay.

200
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.010
I wanted to go to your
cousin Danny here,

201
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.500
but he refused to do any work.

202
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.140
He didn't wanna put his
fingers in the pie. Ooh!

203
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.770
It was getting dangerous.
This amount...

204
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.340
You gotta slow it down.

205
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.340
Okay, see? That shouldn't
be happening right now.

206
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.180
Adon! Adon, Adon, Adon!

207
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.740
Ariel cut open his knee.
It looks awful.

208
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.970
What happened?
Settle, settle.

209
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.210
What do you expect
me to do about it?

210
00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:32.916
It's bleeding.

211
00:09:32.918 --> 00:09:34.418
You know what?
I could stitch him up.

212
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.220
- Why don't you go get me my bag?
- All right.

213
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.300
So, you fell down
the stairs, huh?

214
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.660
Yeah.

215
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.820
Mmm-hmm.

216
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.380
Did you trip over something?

217
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.860
Was there a skateboard
there, or...

218
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.420
No, I was distracted
by something.

219
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.060
What distracted you?

220
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.300
A girl.

221
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.180
A girl, okay.
Was it your mother?

222
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.420
No!

223
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.820
'Cause she just looks good.

224
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.260
That's your stepmom.
I can talk like that.

225
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.380
All right. This is lidocaine.
Don't think about it.

226
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.220
Ow!

227
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
Don't think about it.
Think about your face.

228
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.420
Good, good.

229
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.020
Blonde, brunette, redhead?

230
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.940
Blonde, tan, tall, rocking body.

231
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.380
Nipples.

232
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.500
Want me to numb
something else for you?

233
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.930
You're getting a little
nutty over there.

234
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.540
No! No, I'm good.
I'm good.

235
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.900
I'm alive! I'm alive, everybody!

236
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.100
Good job, Doctor.
That was really nice.

237
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.140
The distraction, I'm guessing.

238
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.300
The what?

239
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.020
The boy was distracted.
That's why he fell.

240
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.380
So, I'm taking the rap for this.

241
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.100
Yes. Your hotness basically
pushed him down the stairs.

242
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.980
Good luck proving that
in court, Wisengruber.

243
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.700
Wisengruber? Is that
what they're saying

244
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.140
on the Gossip Girl nowadays?

245
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.500
I knew you two would
eventually find each other!

246
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.380
But be careful, Palmer,
these plastic surgeons,

247
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.780
they really know how to operate.

248
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.020
Yeah, all right, Adon.
All right.

249
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.860
I just don't know
about plastic surgery.

250
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.500
I mean, doesn't it
always look so fake?

251
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.890
Depends who's doing it. I'm pretty
good at it. I'm telling you.

252
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.900
- Some of my patients are here tonight.
- Oh, really?

253
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.090
Really, really. Look around,

254
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.500
see if you can find
someone decent-looking.

255
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.660
How 'bout her?

256
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.300
The lady from Saw?

257
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.820
Fine. Who did you do?

258
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.940
All right. I hate
to rat the guy out,

259
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.860
but see that guy over there?

260
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.860
You mean Sexy Ass?

261
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.500
Before I met him, he
was No Buns Bobby.

262
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.700
Really?

263
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.900
- His back went straight to his legs.
- No kidding.

264
00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.060
He'd go to the bathroom,

265
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.380
he'd slide right in the toilet.

266
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.820
I know, I know, that's
really romantic, isn't it?

267
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.500
So, North Carolina, how long
have you lived here in LA?

268
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.020
I've been here almost two years.

269
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.540
Uh-huh. That's a lot of
auditioning for you.

270
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.180
You think I'm an actress?

271
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.540
I guarantee you're an actress.

272
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.380
Well, guess again, Doc.
I teach sixth grade math.

273
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.700
They got no schools in North
Carolina to teach at?

274
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.180
My parents divorced.

275
00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.620
Had a pretty nasty
one, actually,

276
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.380
- when I was in the eighth grade.
- Mmm-hmm.

277
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.820
And... I don't know. I got
tired of picking sides, so...

278
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.356
Okay.

279
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:18.364
I thought I'd make a change
and, yeah, move out to LA.

280
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.180
You came to the right place.
No one gets divorced in LA.

281
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.500
Mmm-hmm.

282
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.220
I've never hung out with a girl your age.
This is nice.

283
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.460
Oh, no. Your first lie to me.

284
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.860
You're good. All right.

285
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.220
I've never hung out with
a girl your age and

286
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.220
connected the way
we are right now.

287
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.540
Actually, I've never
connected with,

288
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.580
I don't think any
girl at any age.

289
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.660
See? I can tell
when you're lying

290
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.780
- and when you're telling the truth.
- Oh.

291
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.620
Yeah. The second thing
I said was the truth.

292
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.220
I know.

293
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.540
Oh, my God. That was the
greatest night of my life.

294
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.780
Yeah. This feels
like it could be...

295
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.260
I don't know, a real thing.

296
00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.900
It's a thing all right, Palmer.

297
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.860
Well, I have to get to work,

298
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.300
but how 'bout I take your number

299
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.620
and then you can take me out
on a proper date next time?

300
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.820
I got a business card in my
pocket if you wanna get that.

301
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.140
You better call.

302
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.340
You better not just,
just leave me hanging.

303
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.380
I'd get it for you myself,

304
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.540
but I don't want you to see
me naked in the daylight.

305
00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.500
It could be a deal breaker.

306
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.820
What's this?

307
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.620
A circle?

308
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.420
A wedding ring?
You're married?

309
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.820
No, no, no, I'm not,
I'm not married.

310
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.100
That is a... That is...
That's not mine.

311
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.500
Whose wedding ring is
in your pants, Danny?

312
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.620
All right, listen, just give
me a minute to explain this.

313
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.020
Please.

314
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.381
It's gonna take
more than a minute.

315
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.860
I am such an idiot!

316
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.140
No, no, no, no, no.

317
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.060
Don't call me!

318
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.780
No, Palmer!

319
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.060
I told you that this whole
fake marriage thing

320
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.060
was just gonna come and
bite you in the ass.

321
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.900
Why don't you just
tell her the truth?

322
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.860
You think I can
tell her the truth?

323
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.460
Let me practice.
You be her right now.

324
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.340
Oh, good. Okay, hold on.

325
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.740
Okay. She's not like
that, but anyways.

326
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.740
Um, I wear this fake
wedding ring sometimes...

327
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:42.860
You're a pig.

328
00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.860
Sorry. You're a pig.

329
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.980
What's wrong?
You're walking really weird.

330
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.300
My back. I slept on
the beach last night.

331
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.500
God Almighty.

332
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.420
When are you gonna
strengthen your spine?

333
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.220
Seriously, Flomax.

334
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.220
You gotta work out more
than once a month.

335
00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.820
I can't, I don't have
time to work out.

336
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.420
You do. You can't
say that, Danny.

337
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.660
My mother always said Cary
Grant never went to the gym.

338
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.740
Only took the stairs, every
day, never an elevator.

339
00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.454
You wanna hear my impression of
Cary Grant's butler?

340
00:15:09.464 --> 00:15:10.219
Nuh-uh.

341
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.460
- Watch.
- What?

342
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.860
Hello? No, he's dead.

343
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.620
Okay, bye-bye.

344
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.380
That's good. That's funny.

345
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.740
Mom, give me some money.

346
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.220
Hi. How are you?

347
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.540
Nice to see you, kids.

348
00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.580
Please be polite and say hello to
Dr. Maccabee.

349
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.100
'Ello, Dr. Danny.

350
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.620
'Ow is you today?

351
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.460
Is that my associate,
Dr. Doolittle?

352
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.740
Why is she talking like that?

353
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.900
She's been working
on some accents.

354
00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.140
I am takin' an acting
class this summer, I is.

355
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.860
Gonna be the next
Miley Cyrus, I am.

356
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.460
How 'bout you, young man?
Do you like Hannah Montana?

357
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.460
No. I like Californication.

358
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.300
When do you ever watch
Californication?

359
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.460
Rosa lets us watch Showtime
when she calls her boyfriend.

360
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.660
Eat the mushroom!
Eat the mushroom! Yes!

361
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.380
Mmm. You run a tight
ship at home, huh?

362
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.740
Dr. Danny?

363
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.060
Yeah?

364
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.900
Will you take me to Hawaii so
I can swim with the dolphins?

365
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.500
Take you to Hawaii?
No.

366
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.180
I saw a show on the
Discovery Channel.

367
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.260
They say in Hawaii
they have dolphins

368
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.940
that you can swim with
if you pay money.

369
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.260
Okay.

370
00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.140
But I don't have any money.
And my mom says you're rich.

371
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.140
- Michael!
- No, it's fine.

372
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.340
Maybe you should
make your own money.

373
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.500
Maybe a paper route or
something like that?

374
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.300
'Cause rich people don't
give other people trips.

375
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.420
That's why they remain rich.
You understand?

376
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.980
But my mom says you do charity
for kids all the time.

377
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.460
I do charity work like I fix a
cleft lip or a child's deformity.

378
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.580
I don't take them to Hawaii.
I could get arrested for that.

379
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.020
What if I was deformed?
Then would you take me to Hawaii?

380
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.580
If you were deformed,
I'd bring you to Hawaii,

381
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.220
but I'd leave you there, 'cause
I wouldn't want to look at you.

382
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.140
Okay. Here's the money,
and I want change.

383
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.420
And I wanna hear back

384
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.540
that you actually ate the
food that I am paying for.

385
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.980
Mom, before we go,
can I make a Devlin?

386
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.700
Sure. Down the hall.
Will you please go with him?

387
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.540
We open in five minutes and I am
not having him sit there forever.

388
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.620
Bloody hell right,
I will, Mumsy!

389
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.860
All right, Winston Churchill.

390
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.300
He said,
"I gotta make a Devlin".

391
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.220
- What does that mean?
- Uh...

392
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.900
It's just a friend of mine who
was in my sorority in college

393
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.420
named Devlin Adams, and...

394
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.940
Well, I wouldn't say friend.
I'd say more my nemesis.

395
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.060
- Oh, so she was a frenemy?
- Yes.

396
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.860
You'd probably like her.
She's really, really fake.

397
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.020
Ah.

398
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.860
Always had to have
the coolest clothes

399
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.580
and the hottest boys
and, you know...

400
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.820
- She bothers you.
- A lot.

401
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.540
So, one night, I was just
having a glass of wine.

402
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.500
- A bottle.
- A bottle.

403
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.780
And, uh...

404
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.020
And I just got so tired of
the kids saying things like,

405
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.420
"I gotta take a crap."

406
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.020
"I gotta take a dump."

407
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.300
So, I told them that it was
called "making a Devlin",

408
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.780
and they liked it.

409
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:48.860
And it stuck.

410
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.340
I always call it
making a black pickle.

411
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.180
- Making a what?
- I don't say that.

412
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.100
- Out loud? Good.
- To others. No.

413
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.250
What are we gonna do about
my love life, though?

414
00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.380
Oh, Danny, I would feel
terrible for you if I had any,

415
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.700
even the slightest,
investment in you

416
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.260
successfully banging
23-year-olds.

417
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.940
Holy Devlin, you're
not listening to me.

418
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.540
This is like not some
bull-Devlin fling.

419
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.180
I mean, I'm serious.

420
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.780
This is the real Devlin.
I could...

421
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.260
I swear to God, I could see
myself ending up with this girl.

422
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.620
Oh.

423
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.740
You're right. You can't
tell her the truth.

424
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.980
High score!

425
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.940
Oh, God. Sorry.

426
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.100
I'm glad someone's doing good.

427
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.380
You know what?
You don't wanna get serious,

428
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.660
'cause when you get serious,
that leads to marriage,

429
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.300
and then marriage leads to
divorce, and divorce is just...

430
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.660
I mean, look at these poor kids.

431
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.141
You know, their dad was
supposed to pick them up today.

432
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.580
- He was a no-show?
- Again.

433
00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.940
But you know what?

434
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.500
At least I got my head
together and I divorced him.

435
00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.940
Yeah, yeah.

436
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.580
Wait a minute.

437
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.980
You go ahead without me.

438
00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.380
Oh, no, no, no.

439
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.980
Palmer, Palmer, Palmer,
Palmer, Palmer.

440
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.460
I told you I didn't
want to see you.

441
00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.260
I just want to explain
something to you.

442
00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.580
Let me explain something to you.

443
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.940
I do not date married men.

444
00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.850
My father cheated on my
mom when I was young.

445
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.660
I am not going to
be the other woman!

446
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.700
Adulterer! Fornicator!

447
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.980
All right, take it easy,
Damien, all right?

448
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.941
Okay, his name is Silas,
leave him out of this.

449
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.460
I'll kill you.

450
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.540
What? Anytime!

451
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.460
Listen! I am married.

452
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.900
But it is a horrible marriage.

453
00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.700
She doesn't even
talk to me anymore.

454
00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.500
Danny, that's what
all married men say.

455
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.660
If it's so bad, why
don't you get divorced?

456
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.060
I am.

457
00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.220
- You are?
- Yes! It's over.

458
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.100
Oh, my God, I can't
believe this.

459
00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.580
I destroyed a marriage!

460
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.860
I really feel like I'm gonna be sick.
I can't...

461
00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.940
No, no, it wasn't 'cause of you!

462
00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.020
I filed a long, long time ago.

463
00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.460
We're gonna sign the
papers in a couple of days

464
00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.620
and it's like, she's dead to me.

465
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.020
What's her name?

466
00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.540
Mrs. Maccabee.

467
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.860
You mean her first name?
Her first name is Devlin.

468
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.100
Her name's Devlin?

469
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.020
Isn't that a shitty name?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

470
00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.980
But Devlin and I are
splitting up, fortunately,

471
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:19.380
'cause I caught her cheating
on me with another guy.

472
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.580
I didn't catch her.

473
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.780
The television show Cheaters
caught her and the guy.

474
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.210
And I told them not
to air it, though,

475
00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.380
because it's too painful.

476
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.700
They actually burned the
tape so you can't see it.

477
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.420
But I would love you to.

478
00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.420
There's another man?

479
00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.420
There's another guy, yes. Dolph.

480
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.060
Dolph?

481
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.940
Dolph Lundgren. Yeah.

482
00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.620
Like the guy from Rocky IV?

483
00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.340
No, no, a different
Dolph Lundgren.

484
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.780
Apparently, if you
bring that one up,

485
00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.300
this one gets really
angry, so don't.

486
00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.450
Danny, guys always say they're
gonna leave their wives.

487
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.540
They never do.

488
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.780
I'm telling you, she's
happy with this Dolph guy,

489
00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.020
good for her. Now
I wanna be happy.

490
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.380
And the only way I can be
happy is if I'm with you!

491
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.540
All right?

492
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.980
Just wanna be able
to be with you

493
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.820
and not be called a "fornicator"

494
00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.580
or an "adulterer"
or whatever that.

495
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.420
Children of the Corn
kid was calling me.

496
00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.140
Okay.

497
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.300
Okay?

498
00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.300
I just need to hear it from her.

499
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.740
How about if she texts
you, would that be good?

500
00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.220
I need to meet her.

501
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.420
Let's do it.

502
00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.980
- You want me to be your wife?
- Uh-huh.

503
00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.170
And you couldn't think of another
name, other than Devlin?

504
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.780
I practically took a Devlin in
my pants when she asked me.

505
00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.050
"What's her name?"
I got panicked.

506
00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.170
I get nervous around this girl.

507
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.340
You got panicked?

508
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.580
You who invents a fake
wife every Friday night?

509
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.890
Yeah. Doesn't that say something

510
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.221
about what I feel
about this girl?

511
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.490
Have you ever thought
about the time

512
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.450
- that she's actually gonna walk into your office...
- Uh-huh.

513
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.500
...and sees that I'm your
assistant\receptionist?

514
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.340
So easy.
I'm a plastic surgeon,

515
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.781
you will never look
like you again.

516
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.930
- Snip, snap. Chip, chap.
- What are you talking about?

517
00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.570
I'm kidding. I'll get
you a fake mustache.

518
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.540
Oh, my God, you've really,
really not thought this through.

519
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.500
Will you please just
look at some clothes?

520
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.340
Look at that.
I don't wear...

521
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.820
I have clothes, by the way.

522
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.330
I do not need to do any of this.
I'm fine.

523
00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.210
Yes. You have the best
clothes that Old Navy sells.

524
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.290
I'm just saying you gotta look
like a plastic surgeon's wife.

525
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.660
I want to create the illusion
I had a hot first wife.

526
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.140
- You're so...
- Not this!

527
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.860
Okay, come on,
let's go, you asked for it.

528
00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:20.980
I'm ready.

529
00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.460
Wow! These are...
Oh, geez.

530
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.580
Nice, nice.

531
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.700
It's just been a while since
I've been in heels, sorry.

532
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.820
Okay, okay. Oh, gosh. Okay.

533
00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.700
Get there. Yeah, great.

534
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.220
Oh, my God! These are gorgeous!

535
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.540
How much are these? $1,700.

536
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.300
$1,700? What, do you
come with them?

537
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.500
My parents' house costs $1,700.
No, no.

538
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.340
No. What, did Mickey
Mantle sign those?

539
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.540
Why are they $1,700,
they made outta panda?

540
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.060
- Walk away.
- Yeah. You know what?

541
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.900
We won't really be
needing them anyway.

542
00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.860
'Cause I'm actually
starting to...

543
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.500
I'm actually starting to feel not so hot.
Is it warm in here?

544
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.940
Whoo. I'm not sure I'll be
able to make it this evening.

545
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.660
Very good. Okay, you know what?
We'll take them.

546
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.940
- It's your Christmas bonus.
- Oh, really?

547
00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.780
Okay, then I would like
them in blue, too.

548
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.540
In case a heel breaks or
I just want to cuddle.

549
00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.580
- It's beautiful.
- You sicken me.

550
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.661
Yes, well, that's why
we're getting a divorce.

551
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.860
We're getting a divorce because
you're greedy, schemy and selfish.

552
00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.260
Actually, I think you need to
get the matching bag, too.

553
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.220
Yeah, I think I should.

554
00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.100
- Mmm.
- Thank you, Laurie. I agree.

555
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.170
All the girls are sticking together.
Isn't that sweet?

556
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.820
- Mmm-hmm.
- She's on your side, what a shock.

557
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.620
You asked for this.
Trust me.

558
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.180
Uh-huh. You asked for this.

559
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.540
No.

560
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.380
No.

561
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.220
Hell, no!
No, no, no!

562
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.420
What do you mean, no?

563
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.980
No?
No what?

564
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.260
No hope. Okay?
There's only one word for it.

565
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.620
- What is it?
- Neglect.

566
00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.740
Okay? This is the one word

567
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.330
for the whole thing.
Are you the husband?

568
00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.620
I'm the soon to be ex-husband.

569
00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.940
We're getting a divorce.

570
00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.450
Well, you know he's
not divorcing you.

571
00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.620
He's divorcing your head.

572
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.620
True 'dat, Ernesto.
Right on the money.

573
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.210
Your hair is so messed
up, I don't even...

574
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.300
Let me count the ways.

575
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.420
It's dull, it's dead, it's flat.

576
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.740
Don't forget smelly.

577
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.180
It don't smell,
particularly...

578
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.700
- Okay, I think we got it.
- You bad.

579
00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.100
You is bad. Give me a little bit.
That's bad, though.

580
00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.220
You guys, come on, seriously.
Ernesto, can you just, please

581
00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.980
do something, so we can be home

582
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.100
and I can get out of here?

583
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.220
Hurricane Katrina could
do something, baby.

584
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.650
I'm gonna do something
transcendent.

585
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.820
Katya! Yuri,
Mrs. Hwiggins!

586
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.100
We going in deep, y'all.

587
00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.540
You seem nervous, Danny.

588
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.820
No, no, I just...

589
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.740
It's weird, she
gets me very tense.

590
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.340
I'm sorry to put
you through this.

591
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.980
No, I understand why
we're doing this.

592
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.130
I'm just looking forward to
getting past this part of my life

593
00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.900
and moving on to the good part.

594
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.500
We will. Soon.
Tonight.

595
00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.020
Good God, yes.

596
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.020
Is that her?

597
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.020
I think so.

598
00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.580
She's stunning.

599
00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.260
I love her shoes.

600
00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.660
Yeah, well, she got about
five pairs of them.

601
00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.900
Maybe she'll give you one.

602
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.820
Henderson!

603
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.060
Do you see Dr. Maccabee
anywhere in this...

604
00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.340
Oh! There he is.

605
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.060
Keep the car running,
shan't be long.

606
00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.260
Hello, boring!

607
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.060
Hey. You went with
a limo driver?

608
00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.740
I'm just playing the part.

609
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.220
Okay.

610
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.940
Palmer! Hi.

611
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.780
Devlin Maccabee.
Soon to be, single-abee.

612
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.620
Waiter! Excuse me.
Anybody?

613
00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.060
Yes, yes. Something
to drink, madam?

614
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.540
Well, hello.

615
00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.620
I would like a
tall glass of you.

616
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.620
Is that possible?
Meow!

617
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.300
I'm just kidding.
Unless you're really into it.

618
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.700
Kidding again.
No, I'm not.

619
00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.060
We don't know.
Grey Goose martinis,

620
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.460
just keep 'em coming.
Okay. Ooh!

621
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.420
Make that a dirty martini. Okay?

622
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.660
Okay, that was a good one.

623
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.340
Well, so, Palmer.

624
00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.860
I heard you and Danny had sex.

625
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.500
Yes. I am so sorry, I had...

626
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.140
Please, honey, it is fine.

627
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.820
I'm just happy to hear that his
thing-a-ding can still ring-a-ding.

628
00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.340
'Cause he's got a
serious small issue

629
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.220
with ED. Over here.

630
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.420
Okay.

631
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.980
What's ED?
I don't...

632
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.180
Oh, gosh. I forgot.
You're fifteen.

633
00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.340
Erectile dysfunction,
my darling.

634
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.740
Think about it as if

635
00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.540
you're trying to throw
darts and you just...

636
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.580
All you really got,
you're shooting with,

637
00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.140
like, overcooked spaghetti.

638
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.340
Okay. Yeah.

639
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.020
I just think that my
spaghetti wasn't loving

640
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.700
the meatballs that
was being served.

641
00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.420
- They were a little too lumpy.
- Oh.

642
00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.100
I've heard from a lot
of men that I serve

643
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.220
the finest meatballs in
Southern California.

644
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.380
Of course. A lot of homeless
men have said this.

645
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.940
They'll eat anything, you know.

646
00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.380
I'm just very shocked
that you remember

647
00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.060
anybody you've ever been with.

648
00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.380
With all the pills that
are in your system.

649
00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.380
She likes the pills, this one.

650
00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.220
At night I come home,
"What's for dinner?"

651
00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.740
"Well, we have purple
pills, and the green ones"

652
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.380
"and some lovely yellow bombers."

653
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.180
"I just took out of the oven."

654
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.420
Remember that?

655
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.100
I had to do something
to amuse myself

656
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.580
while this one sat on
the throne for hours

657
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.740
dealing with his irritable
bowel syndrome.

658
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.780
I got another disease. Okay.

659
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.740
Can I tell you, I spent
the eve of our wedding

660
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.220
sitting on the bed,

661
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.900
listening to what sounded
like an underwater symphony,

662
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.140
of French horns and bassoons

663
00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.940
coming out of our
hotel bathroom.

664
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.980
Mix that with the smell of like
a dead cat and some fajitas

665
00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.220
and you've got what
you call yourself

666
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.220
a severely diminished libido.

667
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.660
Ow!

668
00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.100
Did you just kick me?

669
00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.420
No. Did you?
You kicked her?

670
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.540
Why'd you kick her?

671
00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.100
Yeah, I don't... I... Yes.
I... I have leg spasms.

672
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.300
Ow!

673
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.620
It's a side effect.

674
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.541
Terrible side effect from
all the pill popping.

675
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.580
But, you know, it's
all better now.

676
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.740
I'm clean and sober
and I apologize.

677
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.900
It's okay.

678
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.140
Thirteenth step, right there.
Back to drinking.

679
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.540
Oh, Henderson,
you thoughtless oaf,

680
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.020
stop texting, open that door.

681
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.781
- Why do you keep calling me Henderson?
- Just go with it.

682
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.060
Palmer, so lovely to meet you.

683
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.060
Likewise, really.

684
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.940
I mean, look at you two.

685
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.900
I mean, it's like, Barbie and...

686
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.020
Yes.

687
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.900
...Grandpa Ken.

688
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.700
I mean... And even though
it did not work out

689
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.460
between us at all...

690
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.940
It's like it never happened.
You know?

691
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.180
It really isn't.

692
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.660
- I still want my Danny to be happy.
- Oh, look at that.

693
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.940
Happy, happy, happy.

694
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.180
Good night, kiddo. Okay.

695
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.660
Hello.

696
00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.100
It's her drug dealer
I'm thinking.

697
00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.180
Okay, please put her on
the phone right now.

698
00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.020
Are you kidding me, honey?

699
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.740
You know how I feel about

700
00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.700
you selling your
brother's stuff on eBay.

701
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.820
Hey, hey, hey. Take
that in the car.

702
00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.020
No. It's okay.

703
00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:11.860
I will deal with you when I
get home, young lady. Okay.

704
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.300
I mean, you would think...

705
00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.780
You have kids?

706
00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.100
Hmm? Hmm?

707
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.140
You have...
You have children?

708
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.580
We have sort of a little bit...

709
00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.660
A little bit of children, right?

710
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.260
When were you planning
on telling me

711
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.461
about these children, Danny?

712
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.820
I don't know, but listen,

713
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.140
I have to go get to
those little munchkins.

714
00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.220
Palmer, so nice, seriously.

715
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.340
Danny.

716
00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.980
No, no, no, hey, hey.

717
00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.540
Okay.

718
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.540
Are you freaked out right
now about all this or...

719
00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.980
Actually, just the opposite.

720
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.980
The opposite of freaked out?
What do you mean? Good?

721
00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.380
You know that I love kids.

722
00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

723
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.580
I just never pegged
you as a kids guy.

724
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.420
I'm a huge kids guy.
I love kids.

725
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.180
Kids, kids, kids. Is...

726
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's my thing.
That's my bumper sticker.

727
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.700
What are their names?

728
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.860
What are their names again?
There is

729
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.700
the girl who, of
course, is Kiki Dee.

730
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:21.340
And then the boy's name's Bart.

731
00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.860
Which of course is
short for Barto.

732
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.340
Well, I wanna meet them!

733
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.180
Of course you do.

734
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.690
So our mom doesn't
know that you took us today?

735
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.900
Not yet.

736
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.580
You know this is kidnapping.

737
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:34.860
Stranger danger.

738
00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.220
What?
No.

739
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.940
Is the guy from Dateline
NBC gonna walk in?

740
00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:43.420
No! I know you two a long
time and Rosa's here.

741
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.660
Doing whatever that Rosa does.

742
00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.980
- God, she's freaky.
- Yeah.

743
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.100
So here's the deal.

744
00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.100
How would you like to
be my pretend children

745
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.500
for one afternoon?

746
00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.580
Why don't you just tell
that poor girl the truth?

747
00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.740
You know?

748
00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.460
Our mother tells us everything.

749
00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.900
Wedding ring boy.

750
00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.140
- What?
- Oh, my goodness!

751
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.140
Did you see Gossip Girl last night?
It was so good!

752
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.100
No, she's not like that.

753
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.420
Your mother's presenting
her in a weird, weird way.

754
00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.650
I'm just saying,
telling the truth

755
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.140
is not in the cards right now.

756
00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.660
I thought you'd be excited
to have an acting job.

757
00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.980
If it's an acting job,
we should get paid.

758
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.500
Yeah, you're gonna get
paid in experience.

759
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.460
I wanna actually get paid.

760
00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.900
All right, what do you want?

761
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.940
$600 for the day,

762
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.420
plus overtime if we
go over eight hours.

763
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.020
I'll do my own hair and makeup.

764
00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.140
And I want you to pay for the
six-week intensive acting camp

765
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.540
that my mom can't afford.

766
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.540
$50 for the day and a two-week acting
class at the YMCA nearest you.

767
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.140
$500 and a four-
week acting class.

768
00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.660
$300 and a three-week class.

769
00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.020
Done.

770
00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.420
I would have done it for $500.

771
00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.540
I would have done
it for the experience.

772
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.620
Michael, you're up.
Opener?

773
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.500
I want you to take me to Hawaii

774
00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.540
so I can swim with the dolphins.

775
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.380
You're not gonna let
that one go, are you?

776
00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.620
We're not going to Hawaii, pal.
Anything else?

777
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.740
Find someone else then.

778
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.740
Ooh, the Mafia stare down.
Very good, Michael.

779
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.180
We're here to negotiate.

780
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.060
Do you have anything
else you might like?

781
00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.100
I want a flying pony.

782
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.660
I want a flying pony too,
Michael, but they don't exist.

783
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.420
Then I want a regular pony.
And I want to name him Nelson.

784
00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.540
How about a Playstation 3
and we name him Nelson?

785
00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.420
Keep talking.

786
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.540
We'll include four video games.

787
00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.700
Five games.

788
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.420
And I want the meeting with blondie
to be at J.D. McFunnigan's.

789
00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.740
How 'bout Charlie Choo-Choo's

790
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.370
'cause it's right down
the street from me.

791
00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.860
Mention that slop-hole
again and I walk.

792
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.380
All right, take it easy, son.
Take it easy.

793
00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.660
And I want unlimited tokens.

794
00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.220
If I can spend 'em,
I wanna have 'em.

795
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.020
I don't wanna be like
playing Skee-Ball

796
00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.780
and all of a sudden
run out of tokens.

797
00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.500
All right, I can
make that happen.

798
00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.100
So do we have a deal?

799
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.340
Deal.

800
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.980
Deal's off unless you eat that
pizza, though. Seriously.

801
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.820
Can I do an accent?

802
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.460
- Let me hear some.
- 'Ello!

803
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.060
No. Okay.

804
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.100
My kids? Have you
completely lost your mind?

805
00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.900
Are you kidding me right now?

806
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.740
You're the one who picked
up your cell phone.

807
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.140
That is not...

808
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.460
Mrs. Harrington...

809
00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.580
The doctor will see you now.

810
00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.570
I can't believe you're doing all
of this just so you can get some.

811
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.340
It's just gross.
You're just pathetic.

812
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.780
I'm not trying to get some.
I already got some.

813
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.700
And yes, I'd like to
continue getting some.

814
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.300
I'm pro me getting some.

815
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.650
Have a seat right there,
Mrs. Harrington.

816
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.380
Remove your shirt,
if you could.

817
00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:51.020
I smell something.
You smell something?

818
00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.420
I smell perfume.

819
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.460
Is that coming from you?

820
00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.620
Maybe.

821
00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.461
What, you got a
date or something?

822
00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.300
I don't have a date.
I have a lunch.

823
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.620
You got a lunch?
Who you got a lunch with?

824
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.020
Dr. Gervitz's office manager,
if you must know everything.

825
00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.140
His name is Brian.

826
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.020
The guy with the
gray soul patch?

827
00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.460
You know what?

828
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.980
Hey, man, I'm Brian.

829
00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.060
You're mean!

830
00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.450
Wow, you wanna go
to lunch sometime?

831
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.610
Is he gonna take you there
right after the big protest?

832
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.020
Hey, man, we gotta
stop these squirrels.

833
00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:26.860
He plays bass, don't he?

834
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.860
You can take the
brassiere off, too.

835
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.300
And by the way, he
does play the bass.

836
00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.180
And he writes songs.

837
00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.530
What does he write songs about,

838
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.820
how bad his ponytail stinks?

839
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.660
Mrs. Harrington, could you put
your hands on your hips, please?

840
00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.660
Okay, so, one of the funbags
is not having too much fun.

841
00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.180
All right, what
happened anyways?

842
00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.060
Well, I hit it with the car
door yesterday... Right.

843
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.220
...and I heard a pop

844
00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.380
and then some sloshing
sound when I walk.

845
00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.860
Yeah. I think.

846
00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.740
What are you doing?

847
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.700
Could be the kids
or could be Brian.

848
00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.020
Okay. Stop that.

849
00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.250
Do you mind just for one second?

850
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.420
Let me just talk to this guy.

851
00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.900
Stop!

852
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.420
Yeah.

853
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.740
- Hello?
- Yeah, man!

854
00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.740
- Brian?
- You can lie down.

855
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.420
Yeah, hi!
We sure are.

856
00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.180
Yeah, no, sushi would be groovy.

857
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.900
Okay, I'll see you
at 1:00 in the lobby.

858
00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.420
Okay, bye.

859
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.020
What voice was that?

860
00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.460
That was my voice.

861
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.900
Really?

862
00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.020
I didn't sound like that.

863
00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.260
One o'clock...

864
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.540
You're excited about
this guy, huh?

865
00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.460
Mrs. Harrington, this is numbing
cream for your nipples, okay?

866
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.740
Oh. Oh, okay.

867
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.460
It's gonna be one afternoon.

868
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.050
Why are we making such a
big deal out of this?

869
00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.290
Because you know what? You're
trying to get my kids involved

870
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.620
in your dysfunctional, sick little,
pathetic, twisted web of lies.

871
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.490
When I was negotiating
with your son, Michael,

872
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.420
he had the biggest smile I've
ever seen on anyone's face.

873
00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.220
When I told him we could do it at
J.D. McFunnigan's,

874
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.730
the kid looked like he
won the Heisman Trophy,

875
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.220
I'm not kidding you.

876
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.930
I think that's enough.
Do you feel that?

877
00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.980
No.

878
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.100
No, but do you feel that?

879
00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.260
- No.
- We're good.

880
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.460
By the way, did you make this?

881
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.660
Mmm-hmm.

882
00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.500
We'll have to give it
to the Smithsonian

883
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.660
when we've done the operation.
Terrific job.

884
00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.500
Did he really smile?

885
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.500
Swear to God, like the
cutest little smile.

886
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.940
And I got Maggie to eat.

887
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.820
- You did?
- Yeah.

888
00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.940
Pizza. Deep dish. Three pieces.

889
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.580
I can't get her to eat anything.

890
00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.540
I know you can't.
Don't do this for me.

891
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.180
Do it for the children.

892
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.700
- Yeah!
- Oh, stop!

893
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.220
Come on, you're late!

894
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.740
What are you, in
character right away?

895
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.020
Come on, let's go!

896
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.860
She's inside.

897
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.140
What is that?

898
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.700
What?

899
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.500
Did Victoria Beckham have a yard sale?
Why are you wearing that?

900
00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.060
Are you kidding me?

901
00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.460
This is what you bought for me.

902
00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.101
I know, I know.
I'm just saying is it...

903
00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.370
All right, we're stuck with it,

904
00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.650
I just think it's a little
over the top, but...

905
00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.540
Thanks. Happy to be
here to help you.

906
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.500
The first rule of improv is
always accept the information.

907
00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.540
If someone says something,
just go with it.

908
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.740
No negating.

909
00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:10.620
Gotcha. That sounds
good, that's smart.

910
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.180
In my acting class, when
someone says "No" in a scene,

911
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.700
the whole class yells, "Die!"

912
00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.700
No. I mean, no one
will say "no" then.

913
00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.860
Don't yell "die".

914
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.460
Who's up for some
warm-up exercises?

915
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.340
- No, honey, I'm not gonna do that.
- The what?

916
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.970
The tip of the tongue,
the teeth, the lips.

917
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.700
The tip of the tongue,
the teeth, the lips.

918
00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.700
I got one for you.
Shut up!

919
00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.220
All right, let's go already.
Are you ready there, Mafia?

920
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.260
- Hell, yeah.
- Let's do it!

921
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.300
Stinks.

922
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:24.340
Smells like kids' feet and
like skidmark underwear.

923
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.300
Mmm. Happy Father's Day.

924
00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.060
Oh! Jeez!

925
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:35.460
Mommy! That man put his
pee-pee on my face!

926
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:36.740
What?

927
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:41.060
- He put his face on my pee-pee.
- Danny!

928
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.340
- I'm saying he's the one.
- I don't think it matters.

929
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.540
No, I get you.

930
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.460
Oh, oh! Palmer, darling.

931
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.740
Hi.

932
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.980
Devlin. Thank you so much for
bringing the kids today.

933
00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.010
I don't think she was the
only one who brought them.

934
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.500
You know what I'm saying?
They are my pride and joy.

935
00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:00.660
So I'd like to introduce
you to, the one and only,

936
00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:04.620
Kiki Dee, who came out at
nine pounds four ounces.

937
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.740
Yeouch.

938
00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.860
And then the whopper,
we call him, Bart,

939
00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.860
because he was a 12-pounder
and did some damage.

940
00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.500
Okay. So...

941
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.660
Hi, you guys.

942
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.980
Hello, Palmer.

943
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.580
Heard so much about you.

944
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.660
You're British?

945
00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.460
So you're the bird what's been given
Daddy the ol' slap and tickle?

946
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:30.500
We sent her to boarding
school last year in England.

947
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.380
See? So she picked
up a slight accent.

948
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.460
It's, you know, very Madonna.

949
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.100
Well, it is a pleasure
meeting you, Kiki Dee.

950
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.180
Wish I could say the same.

951
00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.740
You see, before you,
I had meself a father.

952
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.740
I was the apple of his eye.

953
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.340
It was all giggling and
chasing butterflies

954
00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.220
in the meadows, and
what have you.

955
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.060
And now what do I got?

956
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.020
An hour and a half
every other week

957
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.580
at J.D. McFunnigan's
with him and his whore.

958
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.820
Koko! Kiki! Kiki!

959
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.540
God, she's in such pain.

960
00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.380
No, that's the pills that...

961
00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.690
She took some out of
her mother's bureau.

962
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.820
Are you...

963
00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.460
All right, let me go see her.

964
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.180
How are you doing, sweetie?

965
00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.540
I'll be better when
I start seeing some tokens.

966
00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.180
He's American.

967
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.580
Excuse me. Yo!
What was that all about?

968
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.700
That was raw and real
and in the moment.

969
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.180
You know, I feel
very good about it.

970
00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.820
You do? Well, I don't!

971
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.620
So if you wanna get your money
and your acting classes,

972
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.500
you better start doing
things right from now on.

973
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.060
No more sob stories.

974
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.340
And we're stuck with the
English accent now, Ringo,

975
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.380
so commit to it.
Don't choke, got it?

976
00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.540
Got it.

977
00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.620
Now hug me and laugh

978
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.540
and let's get back
into the show.

979
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.260
Okay. Papa!

980
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.060
You're not a whore, Palmer.

981
00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.220
Okay.

982
00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.060
That's so nice. See what
they do, they fight,

983
00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.420
then they make up and it's good.

984
00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.820
Good. We're doing good.

985
00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.620
Are you kidding me?

986
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.900
Got a hamburger here for
Bart, Art the Water Fart.

987
00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.020
Here you go, kid.

988
00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.300
Look at that, sweet!

989
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:15.780
And two quesadillas for Kiki
Sneaky With a Side of Freaky.

990
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.100
Here's the waters.
No soda for you.

991
00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.740
- You're battling diabetes, remember?
- Huh?

992
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.140
Kiki Dee?

993
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:28.100
I got you two quesadillas 'cause it's
your favorite food so you have to eat it.

994
00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.820
Well, yes! And that's why I'm going
to eat every single bit of it.

995
00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.740
All right, let's see.

996
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.620
Yummy!

997
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.820
Thank you.

998
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.820
Hey, I think we forgot napkins.

999
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.980
We did? Okay. Well let
me get the napkins.

1000
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.730
Because I know she's not
gonna get up and do it

1001
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.410
because she doesn't like
to get up and do anything.

1002
00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.500
Oh, nice.

1003
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.140
Everybody be cool.

1004
00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:56.860
So, Bart, your dad tells me you
like to go to the bathroom.

1005
00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.860
When I feel it, I do it.

1006
00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.340
What else do you like?

1007
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.940
I don't know.

1008
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.620
That's our Bart.

1009
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.660
He's a man of very few words.

1010
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.740
Ah. Okay.

1011
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.820
Maybe I'm upset.

1012
00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.500
Upset about me and
your father dating?

1013
00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:20.260
No. You seem to make my dad
happy and that's cool, but...

1014
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.220
But what?

1015
00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.620
Nothing.

1016
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:25.850
Hey, I want you to
feel comfortable

1017
00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.020
telling me anything.

1018
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.460
Well, I just hate that he
broke his promise to me.

1019
00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.700
What promise?

1020
00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.060
Yeah, what promise?

1021
00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.060
He promised me last year that
he would take me to Hawaii

1022
00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.220
to swim with the dolphins.

1023
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.700
They have this lagoon
there with dolphins

1024
00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.180
and people get to
swim with them.

1025
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.340
What are you doing?

1026
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.140
But without warning, my
dad canceled the trip.

1027
00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.860
Why would he do that?

1028
00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.980
He met you.

1029
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.460
He what?

1030
00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.460
- No!
- Die!

1031
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:56.660
No, no, no, no, no, no!
I'm saying that did not...

1032
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.060
You misread what I said.

1033
00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.020
I said we have to go
to Hawaii earlier.

1034
00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.340
Because I'm excited for all
of us to hang out there.

1035
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.500
We're going to Hawaii!

1036
00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.340
I can't believe I let a
six-year-old blackmail me.

1037
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.780
I saw my shot and I took it.

1038
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.100
You're angry at yourself

1039
00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.850
'cause you got us into
this whole situation.

1040
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.060
- I did?
- You really did.

1041
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.900
I think old Mary
Poppins with the,

1042
00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.580
"You can't say no.
You can't say no, Guv'nor."

1043
00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.500
Okay, listen, my tolerance

1044
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.780
for these continued
shenanigans is right here.

1045
00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.260
And if it gets up to here,
I'm taking my kids,

1046
00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.180
I'm selling you out
and I'm going home.

1047
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:42.940
I am so happy we are
doing this, Danny.

1048
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.660
Are you kidding me?
We're going to Hawaii,

1049
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.260
we're gonna swim with dolphins.

1050
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.090
It's gonna be so much fun.
I was just telling the squirt.

1051
00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.580
And Seventeen magazine.

1052
00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.450
You brought that for these
guys or is that for you?

1053
00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.020
It's mine. It's my favorite.

1054
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.940
See that? Did you ever
read that magazine?

1055
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.220
Thirty years ago you did.

1056
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.940
And hopefully we're gonna have
time together, right, sweetie?

1057
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.900
Wait! Wait!

1058
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.460
Danny, wait!

1059
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.620
Muffinstein, I could not
stand to be without you.

1060
00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:14.900
Uh-oh!

1061
00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.020
Is this him?

1062
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.660
I see the Colonel von Generous
right here in front of me.

1063
00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.340
Okay, I'm confused right now.

1064
00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.620
I'm so sorry. I've not
introduced myself,

1065
00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.140
we have talked on the phone,
but I am the Dolph Lundgren.

1066
00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:29.660
Devlin's man-friendl
love monkey.

1067
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:30.900
Oh, kill me now.

1068
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.900
Devlin said you had to
stay back and work.

1069
00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.500
I did. She what said?

1070
00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.020
Nein, nein to the work.

1071
00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.820
I will work when I am kaput.

1072
00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.500
You know, I think
this is so great

1073
00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.100
of all of you, so mature.

1074
00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.250
I would have loved if my parents
had done something like this

1075
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:45.660
when they got divorced.

1076
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.980
That's why I was thinking we
should have the man come.

1077
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.700
Yeah, I'm glad. I'm glad.

1078
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.700
It's important for the children

1079
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.860
to see us as a unit.

1080
00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:56.010
And also I cannot stay away
from this potato pancake.

1081
00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.660
She loves the schnitzel,
you know what I mean?

1082
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.260
You know what? Tongue
feels a little dry.

1083
00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.700
Let's go get you some water, honey.
We'll be back.

1084
00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.300
That's a big tongue, big tongue.

1085
00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.740
- Get over here, get over here.
- Ew!

1086
00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:11.860
What are you doing here?

1087
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.100
I don't know, saving the day.
Helping. Hello?

1088
00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.060
Who are you talking to?
What are you looking at?

1089
00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:17.940
I can't see in these things.

1090
00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.170
This is what you're gonna do.

1091
00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.010
You're gonna tell them that you ate a
bad sauerkraut omelet for breakfast

1092
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.410
and that you are feeling like
you're sick and that you gotta go.

1093
00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.100
- Katherine, I can't go. Okay?
- Why?

1094
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.820
Because I texted a picture of my
new equipment to my ex-girlfriend.

1095
00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.940
Oh, you're disgusting.

1096
00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.820
And I forgot she's engaged
to a UFC fighter.

1097
00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.740
He wants to punch
me in the face.

1098
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.420
I wanna punch you in the face.

1099
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:37.620
Hey, guys, how we doing?

1100
00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.380
I am just waiting for the
money for the ticket.

1101
00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.780
Mmm-hmm. So you are coming?
And I am paying?

1102
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.180
Yes. Dolph has zero dollars.

1103
00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.300
- Whoops!
- Okay.

1104
00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:50.980
Let me see if I can
find my credit card.

1105
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.100
Oh, here it is.

1106
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.180
That's for sleeping
with my wife, pal.

1107
00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.100
There you go. Thank you.

1108
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.380
Hey, hey!

1109
00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.180
Didn't have time to
make any reservations,

1110
00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:15.540
but I need two rooms, please.

1111
00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.780
Oh, of course.

1112
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.740
Unfortunately, we only
have our suites left.

1113
00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.060
Oh, boy.

1114
00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.700
The Waldorf Astoria
at $8,000 per night

1115
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.660
and the Presidential at $12,000.

1116
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.340
- $12,000 a night?
- Mmm-hmm.

1117
00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.370
Do the Rolling Stones come and
play for me while I'm in there?

1118
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.250
What the hell are you talking about?
Why is it so much?

1119
00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.340
Is it made out of panda?

1120
00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.021
I've used that somewhere
else, but is it?

1121
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.660
No, but you've made some
terrific suggestions

1122
00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.060
and I'm gonna jot them down.

1123
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.420
Are you a member of the Hilton
Honors Rewards program?

1124
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:40.500
No, I'm not.

1125
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.780
Oh. That's too bad.
You should join.

1126
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:44.060
Yeah.

1127
00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.860
Yay!

1128
00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.020
Just got reamed.
I mean, I got the rooms.

1129
00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:51.780
Who wants to go to the beach?

1130
00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.140
Me!

1131
00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.620
Who wants to start drinking?

1132
00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.500
Me!

1133
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.100
Okay, yeah,

1134
00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:17.020
I would create a fake family for that.
Oh, my God!

1135
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.780
You know what?
You're disgusting.

1136
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.900
Mumsy, please do come in.

1137
00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.380
The water's as lovely
as Westminster in May.

1138
00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.740
No, honey, I'm good.

1139
00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.370
I don't really feel like
swimming right now.

1140
00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.660
What is this from, my Liebchen?

1141
00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.300
Don't you be intimidated by
her whole thing right there,

1142
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.660
which is perfect.

1143
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.940
Oh, come on. Like
she's intimidated.

1144
00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:37.060
I hope when I'm her
age I look that good.

1145
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.220
Yes, right?

1146
00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.980
You can look that good

1147
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.380
if you don't take the elevators

1148
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:45.420
and only take the
stairs like Cary Grant.

1149
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.900
Take the stairs.
Take the stairs.

1150
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.860
Hey, why are
we stopped here?

1151
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.100
Uh, what's the matter?

1152
00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:55.540
I can't look at
engagement rings?

1153
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.540
- Engagement rings?
- Yeah, you heard me.

1154
00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:00.260
Look all you want, but
you and I both know that

1155
00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:01.530
you're gonna get
sick of this hottie

1156
00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.370
and you're gonna be back
on the prowl next week.

1157
00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.260
Nope. I'm telling you,
is this girl not cute?

1158
00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:06.540
Yeah, she's really cute.

1159
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.700
Is she not the sweetest?

1160
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:09.010
The nicest person I've ever met.

1161
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.420
Did you ever see her lips?

1162
00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.010
I think she has the best
lips I've ever seen.

1163
00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.260
They're like an inner tube
and I just wanna sit on it.

1164
00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.940
You know what I mean?
And just, like...

1165
00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:17.580
Do you want me to
knock you out, or...

1166
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.580
No, I'm saying you
should sit on her lips.

1167
00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:21.900
Anyways...

1168
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.700
You know, this whole situation
reminds me of a song.

1169
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.620
Danny is a big plastic surgeon.

1170
00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:30.260
Who never had time for a wife.

1171
00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.700
And he's friends with Davy
Who's still in the Navy.

1172
00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.580
Piano Man? Why Piano Man?

1173
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.020
No, it's "Piano Dan".

1174
00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.970
That's based on your life.
It's a little Eddie remix.

1175
00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:39.980
Uh-huh.

1176
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:44.300
Eddie used to have an afro And
pimples all over his face.

1177
00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.700
So he popped and he poked 'em
And Clearasil soaked 'em.

1178
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.820
But ladies still
greet him with mace.

1179
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.300
I was maced one time.

1180
00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.020
Five times.

1181
00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.580
So, guys, we're here to get
to know each other better.

1182
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:02.740
Yes. Yeah.

1183
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.300
Dolph, let's start with you.

1184
00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.140
So, what line of
work are you in?

1185
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:10.100
Well, Palmer, I am in sheep.

1186
00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.260
I'm sorry. I don't
know what you mean.

1187
00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:16.900
I am a sheep shipper.

1188
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.420
- Oh.
- Yes.

1189
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.660
You know, people, they
don't buy the sheep

1190
00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.300
from the local
sheepherder anymore.

1191
00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.340
Really? They don't?

1192
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.980
No, they don't. They go online!

1193
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.940
Yes! They go on the Interweb,

1194
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:34.420
to my website,
gotprettysheep.com.

1195
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.060
And leave this, please.
Thank you.

1196
00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.340
Now, people go on. They see
the pictures of the sheep,

1197
00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.860
and they pick the
ones they want.

1198
00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.330
You know, it's like,
"I want that one".

1199
00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.650
"You know, it's very stylish.
You know, it's a stylish one."

1200
00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.140
Goes, "Oh, no, I want the shy
one who doesn't want to baa."

1201
00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.860
Or they buy the sassy one,

1202
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:51.420
who's like, "Hey,
I see you, baa, baa."

1203
00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.220
So, what do the people
do with these sheep?

1204
00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:56.300
Whatever they want!
Sky is the limit.

1205
00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.980
You know, some
have them as pets.

1206
00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.220
Some have them as
security for the house.

1207
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.660
A lot of the people...

1208
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.780
The new thing is training them

1209
00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.500
to fight each other in
the Sheep Fight Club.

1210
00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.700
Sheep Fight Clubs?

1211
00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:11.700
Yes. All the sheeps,
they get together.

1212
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.380
They baa, all you hear
is, "Baa, baa, baa".

1213
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.050
And then you see hoof,
kick, hoof, kick,

1214
00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.820
hoof, kick, baa,
baa, baa, baa, baa!

1215
00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.140
And then he's out.

1216
00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:22.740
And that is how we met.
She bought a sheep from me.

1217
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.580
Really? Why?

1218
00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.700
Children? Okay, tune out.

1219
00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:30.740
Okay, 'cause some secrets are coming
out, all right? Some adult ones.

1220
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.660
She likes to shave the sheep

1221
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:38.060
for the pelt for the
sex, sexuals, yes.

1222
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.340
She has got a real fetish

1223
00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.740
for the wool and
stuff, you know.

1224
00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:43.820
We do this thing
called "sheepstenein".

1225
00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:46.980
Danny? Would you come
with me, please?

1226
00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.380
Yeah. Absolutely.

1227
00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.860
So, we're gonna leave right now.

1228
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.770
So you guys play that game
that we always love to play,

1229
00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:52.820
Nobody Talk game.

1230
00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.060
And start now.

1231
00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.540
I'm sorry, we're leaving.
I can't do it. No.

1232
00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.490
- He was going sheep-crazy, I'll give you that.
- I'm gonna kill that guy. He's lost it.

1233
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.040
- Where is your hand right now?
- Where is my hand?

1234
00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:02.150
- You wanna see where it is?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1235
00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:03.612
It's not even here anymore!
It's gone!

1236
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.660
How about I beat him up?

1237
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.420
You can beat him up with me.
It'll be fun.

1238
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.220
I don't want to!
I have to go.

1239
00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.450
- Don't bail on me right now!
- Don't make that face at me.

1240
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.620
I cannot stand that face.

1241
00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:12.780
Katherine?

1242
00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.700
Katherine Murphy?

1243
00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.460
Oh, my God, Devlin Adams.

1244
00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.300
Devlin? Devlin as in taking a...

1245
00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.420
Taking? From what I see...

1246
00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.740
It's my favorite college Devlin!

1247
00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.740
Both of us here at this
resort at the same time.

1248
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.580
I didn't know you came
to places like this.

1249
00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:34.700
Here we go.

1250
00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:35.780
Honey!

1251
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.580
Honey, I want you
to meet someone.

1252
00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.740
This is one of my best
friends from my sorority.

1253
00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:44.580
Katherine, this is my
husband, Ian Maxtone Jones.

1254
00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:45.740
Pleasure.

1255
00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.660
You might've heard of him.
He invented the iPod.

1256
00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.940
Well, of course he did.
The iPod.

1257
00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.300
The idea just came
to me in the shower.

1258
00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:57.980
A shower that I was
taking with Devlin.

1259
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.780
So, this is a cabana you guys
got yourselves here, huh?

1260
00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:06.340
Because my skin is so white.
I don't like to get it burned.

1261
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.180
Even at night?

1262
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:09.970
Well, in Hawaii, you
never know with the sun.

1263
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.100
Very, very strong.

1264
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.060
So you mean like
a moonburn or...

1265
00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.620
- You look fantastic.
- Oh...

1266
00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.020
You look great.

1267
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.340
I'm so glad you got your teeth fixed.
Much better.

1268
00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:27.100
You are just the same glorious
Devlin that I remember.

1269
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.020
Oh, my God, I ran into
Sandra Wernick last month.

1270
00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.980
The poor thing. She's already
divorced and she has a child.

1271
00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:36.860
She's a single mother.
It's a disaster.

1272
00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.540
I feel so bad for her.

1273
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.340
Are you married?

1274
00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.260
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

1275
00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:46.260
Oh! I've neglected to
introduce you to Danny,

1276
00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:51.100
Daniel Leroy Maccabee III,
my husband.

1277
00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.340
Yes. If you want me to stay,

1278
00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:54.690
will you just go with it, honey?

1279
00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.130
Come here and please
meet Devlin and Ian.

1280
00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.780
Hey. This is Daniel.

1281
00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:00.260
IPod, what's up?
How are you?

1282
00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.380
I'm fine.

1283
00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:03.540
- Invented it.
- Pleasure. I heard.

1284
00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:06.500
Devlin, I think I spoke
about you with my wife

1285
00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:08.340
in the bathroom one
or two times, right?

1286
00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.540
We did.

1287
00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:10.980
Number two.

1288
00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.700
We did it twice, yes.

1289
00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:15.460
So, chief, tell me, what
do you do for a living?

1290
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.580
I'm also an inventor,
just like you.

1291
00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.300
I invented the barking hand.

1292
00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.820
I got you.
But you're sunburned?

1293
00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.420
No. What?

1294
00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.260
You are a surgeon.

1295
00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:29.060
He's a plastic surgeon,
and he's one of the best

1296
00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:30.900
according to Los
Angeles Magazine.

1297
00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:32.500
Touchdown!

1298
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.380
Yes. Well, that, yeah.

1299
00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:35.580
Touched it down.

1300
00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:38.021
We gotta go back. We have to run.
It was great to see you.

1301
00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.700
We have to get back to our kids.
So...

1302
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.100
You have kids?

1303
00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:43.500
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, two, actually.

1304
00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.780
We couldn't wait to
start creating lives.

1305
00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:49.020
And by the way,
I created these children

1306
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:50.740
in the shower. Right?

1307
00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:51.164
You did.

1308
00:54:51.189 --> 00:54:52.509
You know what I'm
saying, homeboy?

1309
00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:55.540
That is funny.

1310
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.100
Wow, you've been
together a long time.

1311
00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.100
Am I gonna leave this girl?
Look at her.

1312
00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:00.490
Still gets the flag up the pole,

1313
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.780
if you know what I mean.

1314
00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:04.420
Bing-bang. An iRod,
I should say.

1315
00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.210
Oh. Come on, hit that. Why'd
you leave me hanging so long?

1316
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:08.220
You're so clever.
That's so silly.

1317
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:09.780
The four of us
should get together

1318
00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:11.140
and have dinner one night.

1319
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.740
Oh! That would be almost
like a dream of mine.

1320
00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:17.820
If we could ever get ourselves
out of the bedroom.

1321
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:20.260
Katherine Murphy, look at you!

1322
00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:23.620
Oh, no, not Murphy anymore.
Leroy Maccabee.

1323
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.780
That's right.

1324
00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:28.860
The third. Anyway, so it was great
to see you and meet you, Ian.

1325
00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:31.020
The big E. Love the
Shuffle, by the way.

1326
00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.300
- Good to meet you. Bye!
- Thanks. You, too!

1327
00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.500
What are you talking about?
She was nice.

1328
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.770
- I'm gonna kill you. Come on.
- You need me, though, right?

1329
00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:38.970
I don't believe
that just happened.

1330
00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:40.370
I like that you need me.
How's that make you feel?

1331
00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.940
Please, it feels like a car door
just slowly shut on my soul.

1332
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.180
- Come here! Listen.
- What?

1333
00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:45.660
Do you know how
I feel right now?

1334
00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:46.810
You were getting me so upset,

1335
00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:48.010
bringing me into
that web of lies.

1336
00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.130
My hand's right here right now.

1337
00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.260
Oh, my hand's right there.

1338
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.650
You know what?
I hate you right now.

1339
00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.660
I've gotta write out a
bunch of index cards

1340
00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:55.420
just to keep up with these lies.

1341
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.980
Yeah, and you're gonna make me copies, too.
And one more thing.

1342
00:56:01.756 --> 00:56:02.770
Oh, my God, why are we
leaving the hotel right now?

1343
00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.220
Oh, my God, why are we
leaving the hotel right now?

1344
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:06.740
Why did you wake me up?

1345
00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:07.940
Because, Grandpa,

1346
00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.900
I signed us up for the
all-day adventure tour.

1347
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:13.740
We're gonna go hiking in the
rainforest, and kayaking down rivers

1348
00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.540
and swimming under waterfalls.

1349
00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:17.660
Swimming. I hope you
mean skinny-dipping.

1350
00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.180
I'm gonna suggest swimming.

1351
00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:22.020
I, however, am fine with
some man nudity, Danny.

1352
00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:25.860
Okay, so Swiss Family
nightmare is coming with us.

1353
00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:27.740
That's so we can bond?

1354
00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.860
Oh, that'll be great!

1355
00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.580
It's bloody
breathtaking out here!

1356
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.740
Is this where the blue
Avatar people live?

1357
00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:40.500
Yeah, the blue Avatar people
and I think that black pig.

1358
00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.940
- Where?
- The pig.

1359
00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.940
Look, how cute. Looks like Babe.

1360
00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.380
Oh, my God! Go, Go!

1361
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.220
Come on, go, go!

1362
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.260
The pig is eating my body!

1363
00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:18.380
Keep your eyes on the
river, sweetheart.

1364
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:21.140
Yes. I was looking at the canyon.

1365
00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.140
Hey, what're you guys doing?

1366
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.620
That bridge can only handle
one person at a time!

1367
00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:35.220
Go, go, go!

1368
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.460
What'd he say?
What'd you say?

1369
00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:44.500
Holy Devlin! Ow!

1370
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.500
Come on, let's go.

1371
00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.380
Piggyback times are magical
times, aren't they?

1372
00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:51.460
Yeah, aren't they? You're
warping my spine now.

1373
00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.740
I think Kiki slipped.

1374
00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.900
Oh, Father, I just love
spending time with you!

1375
00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.100
Oh, my God!

1376
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.900
You guys, look at this!

1377
00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:10.020
- Oh, my God!
- It's lovely!

1378
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:12.460
Wow!
That is unbelievable.

1379
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:15.860
I don't know about you guys,
but I am gonna go cool off.

1380
00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.700
Really? There could be
black pigs in there.

1381
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.580
I agree.

1382
00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.300
Look at that. That's terrific.

1383
00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:24.980
Does the hotel know you took
those pillows, honey?

1384
00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.300
She really wears
that bikini well.

1385
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:29.660
Yeah.

1386
00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:33.020
You know what she'd wear well?
Dental floss and a pirate hat.

1387
00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:34.820
- Don't say that.
- Absolutely gross.

1388
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:38.620
Oh, my God! Gorgeous!

1389
00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:39.820
Perfect.

1390
00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:42.980
That was a ten! A perfect ten!
Yay!

1391
00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:46.140
So, Al Jolson, you mind
jumping in the water

1392
00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:48.500
and also screaming on the way
down, "I love my daddy"?

1393
00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:50.060
Okay.

1394
00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:51.860
Yeah, do it, do it for me.

1395
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.500
- Do it for Da-da.
- I love my daddy.

1396
00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:55.660
Daddy is my favorite adult!

1397
00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:58.860
You're paying her
enough for this, right?

1398
00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:01.900
And I love you, my
little British crumpet!

1399
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.740
All right, homeboy, you're up next.
Let's go.

1400
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:06.460
Come up with something
on your own.

1401
00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.900
You gotta squeeze
out another log?

1402
00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:11.740
What happened?
What'd he whisper to you?

1403
00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:13.700
Water's too deep.

1404
00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.260
Water's too deep for what?

1405
00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:16.540
He can't swim.

1406
00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.620
He can't swim?

1407
00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:21.460
And you wanna swim
with the dolphins?

1408
00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.380
That makes a lot of sense.

1409
00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.660
Hadn't thought it through.

1410
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:27.500
No kidding you didn't
think it through.

1411
00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:29.530
Thought about spending all my
money, though, didn't you?

1412
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:31.940
Danny! I'm saying,
I'm not the kid's...

1413
00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:34.380
Okay. No one taught
you how to swim, huh?

1414
00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:38.100
Well, my dad's supposed
to, but he's busy.

1415
00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.340
Uh-huh. Busy being an idiot.

1416
00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:55.100
You guys have to come in,
the water feels magical!

1417
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:58.860
I got something magical, too.
Right in the downstairs area.

1418
00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.620
I don't high-five when it's...

1419
01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.900
Downstairs area!

1420
01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.700
- No, put it away. Sorry.
- No, stop.

1421
01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.700
You know what? I think Mommy's
gonna explore the magical waters.

1422
01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.860
Honey, are you okay to hang
out here with fake Daddy?

1423
01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.460
Sure.

1424
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.100
Really? You're gonna
get undressed?

1425
01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:13.180
What are you doing?

1426
01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.940
What? You got a
bathing cap, too?

1427
01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:16.220
You're the worst.

1428
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.260
A 1920s swimming gown on, honey?

1429
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.540
Don't do it. Don't take it off.

1430
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.620
Yeah. I have to be alone.

1431
01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:38.940
Okay.

1432
01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.780
God, I gotta start
taking the stairs more.

1433
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.980
Don't buy that line.

1434
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.420
She takes spinning classes
like they're M&M's.

1435
01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.020
I think he's wearing
my underwear.

1436
01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.580
What is he doing?

1437
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.940
Yo, I guarantee you fall!

1438
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.460
I'm all set.

1439
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.300
Ow!

1440
01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.020
Thank you, God.

1441
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.140
I wanna climb Palmer Mountain,

1442
01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.940
so what do you say we
get rid of these kids?

1443
01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.660
No. They had them last night.
It's our turn.

1444
01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.180
Isn't that how things work?
We alternate?

1445
01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.700
What? No.

1446
01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:26.660
I get the kids...
I had them today.

1447
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.060
That counted as a "me" day

1448
01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.330
and then she gets them at night.

1449
01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.540
- That's how we do it.
- Oh.

1450
01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:33.300
Dolph, Devlin, do you
want us to watch the kids

1451
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:35.460
so that you guys can have
a little alone time?

1452
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.700
- I don't think...
- Yes! Absoshnutely!

1453
01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.060
We are sleeping together!

1454
01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.980
You guys have your own
beds and it's our time!

1455
01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:43.700
- So we're gonna watch them.
- Good.

1456
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:47.170
You guys wanna come take
a look at the balcony?

1457
01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.450
I think I saw some
dolphins around here.

1458
01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.700
Dolphins? Hey, he loves those, right?
Dolphins.

1459
01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.900
Sorry. Okay, go.

1460
01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.340
All right, let go. Come on.

1461
01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.820
- Get the dolphins.
- Bye, you guys.

1462
01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.580
That's why we're
here, the dolphins.

1463
01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:58.740
See you out there.

1464
01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.340
Listen, if anything happens

1465
01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.981
and you need any...
And I mean anything,

1466
01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.220
you have to call me.

1467
01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.820
I'm good at this,
I swear to you.

1468
01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.020
I used to baby-sit Eddie
when we were children.

1469
01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:09.460
- Eddie is your fault?
- No, no, no.

1470
01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.340
But I want you to enjoy tonight.

1471
01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:12.570
Come on, it's like a free night.

1472
01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.020
You can do whatever you want.

1473
01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.940
You can knit yourself some socks

1474
01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.940
or shock people with
your sneaky hot body.

1475
01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.890
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Cary Grant?

1476
01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.220
I'm just gonna sit in my room

1477
01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.860
and worry about you and
them and everything.

1478
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.780
What about just hang
out platonically

1479
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.500
with Eddie tonight?
Have some dinner?

1480
01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.940
Or is he not good enough?

1481
01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:32.020
You need Brian, the guy
from Foghat, around here.

1482
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.420
That really bothered you

1483
01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:35.380
that I went to lunch
with that guy.

1484
01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.050
What do you mean, you
went to lunch with him?

1485
01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.060
I told you I was going
to lunch with him.

1486
01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.940
I thought it was he
asked you to lunch

1487
01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.370
and you were gonna
like scoff at it.

1488
01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.700
But you did?
You fell for his charms?

1489
01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:47.540
I don't even understand
what this is.

1490
01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.940
It's the beard, man.

1491
01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:50.340
It doesn't move!

1492
01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:53.220
Well, yeah, in the wind, man.
It's flapping around.

1493
01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.930
All right. You know what?
I'll tell you this.

1494
01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.460
The guy made it through an
entire lunch with a woman

1495
01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.180
without making up a fake life.

1496
01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:00.820
Ah.

1497
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.580
You just hurt me.

1498
01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.740
That was not nice,
but it was the truth.

1499
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.900
And I speak the truth.

1500
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.620
Please pay attention
to my children.

1501
01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:10.860
Everything will be nice.

1502
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:13.740
They serve room service
in the hallway.

1503
01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:16.260
I'm so nauseous. Okay. Bye.

1504
01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.540
Alone at last!

1505
01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.020
Let's play the game.

1506
01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.140
We were doing so
good with the game.

1507
01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.820
"If you could be one
person besides yourself,"

1508
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.220
"who would you be?"

1509
01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.020
Rachael Ray, because I've always

1510
01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.141
wanted to know how to cook.

1511
01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.940
- Really?
- Oh, she's darling.

1512
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.700
You know what? I don't
really wanna be anyone else.

1513
01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:47.460
I'm happy with who I am.
I choose me.

1514
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:49.820
Or Captain Kirk. Either one.

1515
01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.700
- See, that's a good one.
- All right.

1516
01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.020
What about you, Bart?

1517
01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.100
Mr. DeCesare.

1518
01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.500
Our mailman? Why?

1519
01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:02.540
He just seems like he's
got it all figured out.

1520
01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:04.340
We're getting deep.

1521
01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:07.660
Okay, moving on. Uh...

1522
01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.460
Okay. "Name something
that makes you sad."

1523
01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:17.300
That Judi Dench has never won
the Oscar for Best Actress.

1524
01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:20.100
It's a travesty.

1525
01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.460
That 'N Sync broke up.

1526
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.860
Yeah. That was rough
on all of us.

1527
01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:29.140
Who's 'N Sync?

1528
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.340
Sadness. Bart, you're up.

1529
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.540
I don't wanna say mine.

1530
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.460
Okay. Let's move on then.

1531
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:38.700
Hey!

1532
01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:40.980
Honey, come on. You can
share anything with us.

1533
01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.180
Yeah, share.

1534
01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.061
He looks like he's about
to lose it, but okay.

1535
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.340
When my dad doesn't
have time for me.

1536
01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.660
Come on, it's okay.

1537
01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.900
We're okay. We're okay.
It's fine.

1538
01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.660
It's all gonna be okay.
Come on.

1539
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.860
We don't need him in our lives.

1540
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.340
Wow.

1541
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:01.740
No, no, no, he's...

1542
01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:03.060
We're okay. It's fine.

1543
01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.660
It's all gonna be okay.

1544
01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.700
This has nothing to...

1545
01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.100
This is, like, from
a long time ago!

1546
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.180
It's okay.

1547
01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.020
What are you doing?

1548
01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.780
Well, that was
a major setback.

1549
01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:20.860
"When my dad doesn't have time
for me."

1550
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.820
We're sorry.

1551
01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.060
I know you're sorry.

1552
01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.050
I know you got real stuff
going on with your family.

1553
01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.260
And it's painful.

1554
01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.220
But you gotta just hold it in

1555
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.900
till you get to the
mainland again.

1556
01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.290
You're the ones who
wanted to come here

1557
01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:33.530
and go swimming
with the dolphins

1558
01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.700
or standing with the dolphins
because you can't swim.

1559
01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.900
- Can you act professional?
- Yes, sir.

1560
01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:40.100
For at least two more days,
until I kill you off

1561
01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.260
in a boarding school
train accident?

1562
01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:44.100
I thought it was a car accident.

1563
01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.260
I don't know. Either that

1564
01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:46.770
or a science explosion,
just something.

1565
01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.020
You're gonna be dead soon.
That's the good news. Okay?

1566
01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:51.300
So, can you just focus
for a few more days?

1567
01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.740
- Yes.
- Good.

1568
01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.420
So, give me some fake hugs
right now and laugh real loud

1569
01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.930
like we're the happiest
family on earth.

1570
01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.420
Okay. Is that possible?

1571
01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.980
And laughing,
laughing, laughing.

1572
01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:03.580
Okay, that's it. Laugh
louder, louder.

1573
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.540
I love you guys!

1574
01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.100
Hey, sweetie! What's going on?
What's up?

1575
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.300
So, kids, I just got off
the phone with your mom

1576
01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.980
and you guys are gonna
have plenty of time

1577
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.500
to spend with your dad tomorrow

1578
01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:20.740
because she and I are gonna
have a nice, long spa day.

1579
01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.900
Aw!

1580
01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.980
Awesome! Awesome, awesome.

1581
01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:27.020
You guys are so...

1582
01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.060
I'll see you in a minute, okay?
I love you.

1583
01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.260
- Okay, he's losing it.
- Okay, good night.

1584
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.420
He's losing it.

1585
01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:39.500
All right, here we go.
Everybody out.

1586
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.980
So, what are we doing?

1587
01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.500
Palmer forgot her
camera in the room

1588
01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.060
so I'm gonna have a
surprise for her

1589
01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.540
when she gets back from the spa.

1590
01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:49.980
A stolen camera?

1591
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.620
No, some pictures of
us having a great time

1592
01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.340
reassuring her of all the
fun we have together.

1593
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.380
I forgot to flush the toilet
before I left the hotel.

1594
01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.220
So she's gonna have
two surprises.

1595
01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:04.500
Okay. No one's supposed to
crap as much as you do.

1596
01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.860
You gotta look into that
Pepto Bismol or something.

1597
01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.140
Here's your putters. Bing.

1598
01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:11.060
- And a bam.
- Thank you.

1599
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:14.140
Let's just look right in the camera.
And we're having fun.

1600
01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.140
And we're a family.
We love each other.

1601
01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.020
And boo!

1602
01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.820
All right, let's do the old
Michael-hit-a-putt shot. Okay?

1603
01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.860
So boom, that's in the hole.

1604
01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.180
And you're excited about that,

1605
01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:27.260
and we're happy for him, and...

1606
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.810
Maggie just hit the ball, but
you followed through too much

1607
01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.220
and it made you
fall on your back.

1608
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:32.660
Okay, but... Look at this.

1609
01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.981
You're laughing, but I'm a
concerned father, so I'm like,

1610
01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.940
"Oh, my God."

1611
01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.860
All right, now,

1612
01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.090
let's just laugh at something I
say, because I'm a funny dad.

1613
01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.210
You're very close with me, and
you think I'm funny, and...

1614
01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:44.460
Why are we always laughing?

1615
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.860
Is there something
wrong with us?

1616
01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.860
No. You're just amused by everything I say.
So, here we go.

1617
01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.420
Can we take a break?
Do something really fun?

1618
01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.220
No, we're not doing
anything fun, man.

1619
01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:54.900
We're here to fake having fun.

1620
01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.140
Come on. Right to the camera.

1621
01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:59.100
Don't worry. We never have fun
with our real dad either.

1622
01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.700
Oh, man.

1623
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.420
All right. How's this?

1624
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.020
I'll teach you how
to swim, okay?

1625
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.860
Before your mother gets back

1626
01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.420
from the "spa day"
in four hours?

1627
01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.260
- Is that even possible?
- Yeah.

1628
01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.370
But we're gonna take one more
picture, if you don't mind.

1629
01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.540
Make that two pictures. Maggie.

1630
01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:19.410
Throw this straight in the air.
Make it look like...

1631
01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:21.100
On the count of three, one, two, three.

1632
01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.260
Okay.

1633
01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:23.900
Now, Michael, lay down.

1634
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.860
On your back. And...

1635
01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.380
Yeah, all the way over. See
if you can clench this.

1636
01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.300
Now look like you're in pain.

1637
01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:32.780
Ooh!

1638
01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:38.140
It took my friend a whole
summer to learn how to swim.

1639
01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:39.901
How're you gonna
teach me so quick?

1640
01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.460
I'm gonna do it the same way
my grandfather taught me.

1641
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.820
Don't worry.

1642
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.020
It took Grandpa eight
hours to teach us.

1643
01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:51.100
It was a nightmare.

1644
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.060
But there's two of us here
now, and we're sober.

1645
01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:55.500
You're gonna be fine.

1646
01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.780
All right. You're doing great.

1647
01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:59.620
- Is he doing great?
- He's doing great.

1648
01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.370
Okay. We want to advance
a little, though.

1649
01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.300
I need you to swim
to Uncle Eddie.

1650
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:04.970
If you get there without
touching the bottom,

1651
01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:06.300
we'll give you a dolphin cookie.

1652
01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.261
Is that what your
grandpa gave you?

1653
01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.420
No, Grandpa gave us something
he'd call a Heineken.

1654
01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:14.500
I want one of those.

1655
01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.901
No. Stick with the
dolphin cookie.

1656
01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:18.660
Yeah. They hurt less when
they get thrown at your head.

1657
01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.260
God, he was a sick man.

1658
01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:22.660
Yeah. Okay? Are we ready?

1659
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.130
Don't think about it.
Commit. Kick, kick.

1660
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.940
Get the cookie. Move your feet.

1661
01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.140
Kick, kick!

1662
01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.140
Right there! Reach for it!
You got it!

1663
01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.340
Doing good, buddy!

1664
01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:35.460
There you go!

1665
01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.620
My boy! That was
terrific, buddy.

1666
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.180
Have your cookie. We're
gonna move on, though.

1667
01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:41.580
Hey, Devlin?

1668
01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:44.700
Devlin? Yeah?

1669
01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.060
So, Danny's birthday
is next week,

1670
01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.740
and I have no idea
what to get him.

1671
01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:53.340
Well, don't get him a tie.

1672
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.580
He has 100 of them and
he never wears them.

1673
01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:56.740
That's good to know.

1674
01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.140
He loves books on
tape for his car.

1675
01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.420
Fishing gear.

1676
01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:03.140
Loves it. Doesn't use it.

1677
01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.700
Can't take the fish
off of the hook

1678
01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.700
once he catches it, so
he just collects it.

1679
01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.740
He loves candy. Jelly Bellies.
Loves them, his favorite.

1680
01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.890
But he only likes the Cotton
Candy and the Peanut Butter.

1681
01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:15.020
So you have to buy the bag
of the Jelly Bellies,

1682
01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.730
separate the Cotton Candy
and the Peanut Butter

1683
01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.900
and put them into a little...

1684
01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.890
It's a kind of Ziploc
baggies that I got online.

1685
01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.860
You know so much about him.

1686
01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.020
Yeah.

1687
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.940
I've known the guy forever.

1688
01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.900
Music. Loves music.

1689
01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.260
But anything after
'95, don't bother.

1690
01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:34.540
You'll lose him.

1691
01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:36.940
That's when I finished
my Girl Scouts.

1692
01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:40.900
All right. How many
cookies do we got left?

1693
01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:42.780
Maybe about forty!

1694
01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:45.580
What do you think, 40
feet for 40 cookies?

1695
01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.380
Can you handle that?
You need a little rest?

1696
01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:48.540
Let's do this.

1697
01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:51.620
Really? Okay, he's ready!
He's ready to rock!

1698
01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.020
Almost.

1699
01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:54.420
What? No.

1700
01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:58.420
Oh, my! Ladies and gentlemen,
off come the floaties!

1701
01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.420
This is getting serious!

1702
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.780
Are you sure about
this, Michael?

1703
01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:03.460
Hell, yeah. All right.

1704
01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.620
No matter what, you're
a good man, okay?

1705
01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:07.980
Keep kicking. I'm
here if you need me.

1706
01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:09.100
You got this.

1707
01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.740
Go! Go, Michael!

1708
01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.380
Go! Breathe! Yeah!

1709
01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.060
Kick it! Go!

1710
01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:15.580
Move your arms! Yeah!

1711
01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.900
He doesn't have floaties on!

1712
01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.580
Oh, my God!

1713
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.980
Get the cookies!

1714
01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.900
Come on, sweetheart!
You've got it!

1715
01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.341
A little bit more,
little bit more.

1716
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.740
- Swim! Swim!
- Oh, my God!

1717
01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:31.340
- Come on!
- Just a little bit more!

1718
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.100
Keep going, Michael!
Don't give up!

1719
01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.820
Very nice!

1720
01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.740
That's my boy! Yeah, buddy!

1721
01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:48.420
I did it! I did it! Thank you!

1722
01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.140
No way, that was you, buddy.

1723
01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.700
That was awesome. Way to go!

1724
01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.300
What are we looking at?

1725
01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:05.140
Jeez. Oh, God. Devlin.

1726
01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:09.140
Devlin. Oh, God. You
snuck up on me.

1727
01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:10.900
- Did I? Oh...
- Yes.

1728
01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:13.580
Do you startle easily?
That's a sign of menopause.

1729
01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:14.660
Hmm...

1730
01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:16.300
Devlin?

1731
01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:18.540
Palmer Dodge, this is Devlin.

1732
01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.700
She and I went to
college together.

1733
01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.780
- This is Palmer Dodge.
- Aloha, Palmer.

1734
01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.700
Is this your daughter?

1735
01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:29.540
No, no, no. I'm actually
the girlfriend.

1736
01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:30.700
Whose girlfriend?

1737
01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:33.220
Yes, hi.

1738
01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:36.580
I am the Dolph. Willkommen.
And you're very beautiful.

1739
01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.820
Married, flattered. Thanks.
Where's Danny?

1740
01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:42.580
Danny is in the water teaching
our little boy how to swim.

1741
01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:43.820
Hi, Doctor!

1742
01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:45.900
He was so sweet.

1743
01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:48.261
You know what's so crazy is
that I have never met anybody

1744
01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:49.700
with the first name
Devlin before.

1745
01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.420
You know, and here you are,
and your name's Devlin and...

1746
01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.900
Shark attack!

1747
01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:57.980
We are playing Bavarian pool
rugby and now I'm in the lead.

1748
01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:59.380
Okay, bye!

1749
01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:03.740
She's trying to beat
me, but she won't.

1750
01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:05.820
No one can!

1751
01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:06.980
This is fun!

1752
01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.420
Anyway, something's opened
up in our schedule tonight.

1753
01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.100
So, we were wondering
if you and Danny

1754
01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:12.420
were good to go for dinner.

1755
01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.780
- Oceano's. Seven o'clock.
- Oh, no...

1756
01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:18.060
Oh, no, you don't! She's like a shark.
Come on.

1757
01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.340
Is it a bad night?
Are you two fighting?

1758
01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.060
No! We're not fighting.

1759
01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.260
No, we just, we're delighting.
We're just fine.

1760
01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:27.060
No, that's great. Tonight's gonna happen.
Yeah, perfect.

1761
01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.940
Perfect. Anyway,
see you tonight!

1762
01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.260
Okay, Devlin.

1763
01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.420
Oh, my God! Dolph,
let her breathe!

1764
01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:34.540
Yes, I...

1765
01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.100
Dolph! What?

1766
01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.260
What was that?

1767
01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:41.620
I was... Were you under...

1768
01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:45.220
I don't understand.
Why would you say yes?

1769
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.100
Because I didn't know,
I didn't say no.

1770
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.860
I'm not leaving here.
What would I tell Palmer?

1771
01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.660
What's going on, sweetie?

1772
01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:03.740
So, today, you know, with
Dolph pushing me in the pool.

1773
01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.140
It was weird, right?

1774
01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:07.380
No, no, no. He's a sheepherder.

1775
01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:08.810
That's what those
guys do, you know?

1776
01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.740
They do a lot of horseplay

1777
01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.740
and that's kind of
initiation time for you.

1778
01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:14.420
You're in the gang, I think.

1779
01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.020
Okay. Yeah.

1780
01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:19.860
Well, I was thinking
for tonight,

1781
01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:23.220
maybe we could have a
little me and you time?

1782
01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:24.580
Oh!

1783
01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:29.180
I'll get my rubber duck
and see you in a sec.

1784
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.820
Yeah, no, I'm not
doing this tonight.

1785
01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:35.020
It's like my first night
alone with the girl.

1786
01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:36.860
All I'm asking you is one favor!

1787
01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:40.620
Just get this one dinner
with me so I can save face

1788
01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:43.260
with this horrible,
heinous human being.

1789
01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:44.540
What am I gonna tell Palmer?

1790
01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.060
Would you just put
her on the phone?

1791
01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:51.860
Oh, God.

1792
01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:54.020
Tell me she is not
listening to 'N Sync.

1793
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.900
No, no, no. It's coming
from the elevator.

1794
01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:58.300
Hey!

1795
01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.980
Danny, that is my jam.

1796
01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.300
Someone on the phone for you.

1797
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.020
- I don't know who.
- Okay.

1798
01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:06.060
Hello?

1799
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:07.660
What is that?

1800
01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:09.060
- It's Palmer.
- So?

1801
01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.970
I need you to get on the phone.
I need you to ask her out.

1802
01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:12.810
I need you to take her as far away
from the hotel for the entire night.

1803
01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:14.010
Would you please
just do this for me?

1804
01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:16.660
No, I'm already eating.
I just wanna hang out. Ow!

1805
01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.530
Seriously, I need you.
What are you doing? No.

1806
01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:20.140
Ow! My gosh.

1807
01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:21.980
- Take it.
- All right.

1808
01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:24.180
Go for Dolph.

1809
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:25.820
It's Dolph.

1810
01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:27.180
Okay, I got an idea.

1811
01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:29.180
How about you and me,

1812
01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:31.980
we go and get the
dinner tonight?

1813
01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.140
To supper?

1814
01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.500
Tonight?

1815
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.850
Yes, and we get to
know each other,

1816
01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.740
because I think it's
important for the kids

1817
01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:41.380
to have good symmetry
in the family unit.

1818
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.580
Yeah, hang on. Let
me check with Danny.

1819
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.900
Dolph wants to do
dinner tonight.

1820
01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:47.740
No. No, no, no.

1821
01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.220
All right, tell him yeah.

1822
01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.500
Yeah, that's fine.

1823
01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.540
Awesome. Thank you so much.

1824
01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.650
What am I supposed to
say to her all night?

1825
01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:02.180
You spout crazy nonsense for
hours in Eurotrashenese.

1826
01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:05.620
Just do it, but just do it
far away from the hotel.

1827
01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.060
Okay, fine, I'll do it,

1828
01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.620
but if I do good, can I
sleep in the bed with you?

1829
01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:13.540
No. Why? You've got a
great private room.

1830
01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.300
Hmm, really? Because when
we were in the Napa Valley,

1831
01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:30.860
they said that wasn't a good
time of year for Merlot.

1832
01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:34.220
Oh. How about the
Verite Cabernet?

1833
01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:36.340
Isn't Cabernet really grapey?

1834
01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.580
I mean, I like grapey,
but not overly grapey.

1835
01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.620
Did you go over the index cards?

1836
01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:42.740
I glanced at them, yes.

1837
01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:43.940
You glanced at them?

1838
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.500
I graduated med school

1839
01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:48.060
without reading a book.
Just relax.

1840
01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.300
Just give us the most
expensive bottle you have

1841
01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.060
and it'll probably
be good enough.

1842
01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:53.380
Perfect!

1843
01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:57.820
Look at us, Katherine. Both
so happily married. I mean...

1844
01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:59.620
Can you believe it?

1845
01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.260
Everything I always
hoped for, right, Yogi?

1846
01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:03.460
Mmm. Boo-Boo.

1847
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.300
- My Yogi Bear.
- My Boo-Boo.

1848
01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:08.860
Never enough.

1849
01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:24.300
Hold on a second.

1850
01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.900
I love the way you smell.

1851
01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.540
Nothing smells as
good as Devlin.

1852
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.980
Smelling Devlin,
always a good thing.

1853
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:41.500
This is really where
we're eating?

1854
01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:43.220
Oh, yes. No, the hotel says

1855
01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:46.100
it's amazing und very far away.
Yeah, it's good.

1856
01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:48.420
Hey. I want that car.

1857
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.980
I'll give you two
chickens for it.

1858
01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:52.940
Two chickens, that's
very nice of you, but...

1859
01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.100
Don't be scared.

1860
01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:55.380
We're just here for dinner.

1861
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.820
Also, this car's worth
about 10,000 chickens.

1862
01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.020
Don't pour over me.

1863
01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.420
Don't pour over me.

1864
01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.420
I'll bring my glass to you.

1865
01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.940
So, Danny, you're a
plastic surgeon.

1866
01:18:07.964 --> 01:18:08.759
Yes.

1867
01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.620
Very convenient for
you, Katherine.

1868
01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.620
No, this girl's
had nothing done.

1869
01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.060
She's just a natural beauty.

1870
01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:15.300
- She really is.
- Sweetie.

1871
01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:17.900
What about me?
What would you do to fix me?

1872
01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:19.940
Professionally speaking?

1873
01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.700
Nothing. I wouldn't
do a thing to you.

1874
01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:22.900
Nothing?

1875
01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.620
You're too sweet.

1876
01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:27.060
They already took too much
fat out of your arms,

1877
01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:28.460
but that's what sleeves are for.

1878
01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.460
So, where did you two meet?

1879
01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.660
We just, we met at a concert.

1880
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:36.980
- Sting.
- Yeah.

1881
01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.980
Live at the Index Card.

1882
01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:41.700
It was a benefit for
the rainforest.

1883
01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:45.700
Someone's on the phone for you.

1884
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.500
I think it's the
guy from The Omen.

1885
01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.660
Go for the iMan.

1886
01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:53.660
Hold on a second.

1887
01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:56.500
Can I say something before you
say what you're gonna say?

1888
01:18:56.980 --> 01:19:00.380
Seeing the man who invented
the iPod, on the iPhone,

1889
01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.820
- saying, "Go for the iMan..."
- Yeah.

1890
01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.940
...that was like
watching Ronald McDonald

1891
01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.740
eat a cheeseburger
off the Grimace.

1892
01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:09.020
- I'm serious. That was serious stuff.
- It's so true.

1893
01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:13.020
That, to me, was like watching
Dr. Kevorkian kill himself.

1894
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:14.180
Oh, no.

1895
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:16.700
I'm sorry. This is one
of my foundations.

1896
01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:18.260
I've gotta take this.

1897
01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.820
Your virtue, your
intelligence, your passion.

1898
01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:25.980
Your beauty, your drive,
and your womanhood.

1899
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:35.540
It's something we do
whenever the other leaves.

1900
01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.780
We say what we love
most about the other.

1901
01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:39.610
- That's really nice. That's big.
- I like that.

1902
01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:40.860
You guys should try it.

1903
01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.780
- Yes, we should.
- We should. We'll try that later.

1904
01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.700
- We have to.
- Not everyone can do it.

1905
01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:47.940
We'll do it now.

1906
01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:50.140
- Right now.
- Okay.

1907
01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:52.300
So, broke and penniless,

1908
01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:55.100
I took to the streets
to sell my wares.

1909
01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.500
And by wares, I mean my body.

1910
01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:00.060
And by body,
I mean my schnitzel.

1911
01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.460
Mmm.

1912
01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.780
Help! Is there a
veterinarian in the house?

1913
01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:06.340
My pet sheep, he passed out.
He's not breathing!

1914
01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:07.781
I don't know what's
wrong with him!

1915
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:11.700
Him! Him! He's not a vet,
but he sells sheep for a living.

1916
01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:13.980
Oh, me, yes.

1917
01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.420
I do, yes. I am that.

1918
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.660
Please come this way!

1919
01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.180
- Now?
- Yes!

1920
01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:20.420
This way, this way!

1921
01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.660
What is this?

1922
01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:23.700
Is that a real sheep?

1923
01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.020
Okay.

1924
01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:30.260
Yes, um...

1925
01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:32.900
Hello...

1926
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.180
Yes?

1927
01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:40.220
Yes, in my expert opinion,
that sheep is dead.

1928
01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:41.540
I'm very sorry.

1929
01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:43.500
Let's go eat. Okay, show's over.
Let's go.

1930
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.380
Oh! He's still alive!

1931
01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:47.740
Please, you have
to do something!

1932
01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:49.740
Oh, shit on me.

1933
01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:52.180
You look each other in the eyes

1934
01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:55.020
and you say what you love
about the other. Mmm-hmm.

1935
01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.220
We can't just say it? We gotta
look at each other for this thing?

1936
01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:00.180
Okay. Yes. We're so ready.

1937
01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:01.620
Are you ready?

1938
01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:02.940
Go ahead.

1939
01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.340
- You're on.
- Okay.

1940
01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:06.780
Come on.

1941
01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:09.180
Um...

1942
01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.220
I love your sense of humor.

1943
01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:16.460
- You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

1944
01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:17.860
All of it?

1945
01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:20.620
Every dirty bit of it.

1946
01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:24.540
I love your, uh, stories.

1947
01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:26.980
- Yes. They can go long, but...
- It's okay.

1948
01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:29.140
- ...I try to finish strong.
- Always entertaining.

1949
01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.620
And I love that you...

1950
01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.620
Love that you read
the index cards.

1951
01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:37.980
Of course.

1952
01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.940
And I love that you secretly

1953
01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:45.780
have a huge heart,

1954
01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:51.580
and it's just filled
with kindness

1955
01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.300
and humility.

1956
01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:57.060
And blood?

1957
01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:59.460
I'm sure there's blood.

1958
01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:05.100
I don't know, I...

1959
01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:10.980
I just think you're a really
nice person and I really like...

1960
01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:14.980
I really love spending
time with you.

1961
01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:18.260
That's good enough
for me right there.

1962
01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:19.620
Yeah, game over.

1963
01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:22.140
Danny?

1964
01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.460
Game back on? We gotta...

1965
01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:25.820
Um...

1966
01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.980
Well, I'd like to
start off by saying

1967
01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:33.020
that I love the most that
you fixed your teeth.

1968
01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:35.020
Why did I know that...

1969
01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.460
They were horrible, I agree.

1970
01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:40.420
No, no. Um...

1971
01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.180
- You know what I love?
- Mmm-hmm?

1972
01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:46.020
How you just do everything
for everybody else

1973
01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:47.820
and you never expect
anything back.

1974
01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:52.140
In fact, when I say thank you,
I don't know, do you hear that or not?

1975
01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.380
It's cute.

1976
01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.020
And I love...

1977
01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:58.700
I just love...

1978
01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:03.660
You're the only person I've
never lied to in my life.

1979
01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:05.500
I swear to God.

1980
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.700
I just trust you more than
anybody in the world.

1981
01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:11.900
You know every secret about me.

1982
01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.380
I love your smile.

1983
01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:20.060
That smile is the magic.

1984
01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:23.100
When I'm in the operating
room all I think about is,

1985
01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:27.220
"All right, 20 more minutes,
I get to see the smile."

1986
01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.220
It's just like...

1987
01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:32.740
It starts my day, that smile.

1988
01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:42.460
I won best smile at our sorority

1989
01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:44.500
three years straight,
right, Katherine?

1990
01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.900
Not little Bucky here.

1991
01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:57.260
Okay, here we go! Hi, yes! Wee!

1992
01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.020
We do the sheep dance, right?

1993
01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.900
We want to live and
dance more, yes.

1994
01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:03.220
Okay, all right. Here we go.
Eat some food.

1995
01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:05.380
Eat the food. Come
on, here we go.

1996
01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:06.540
Couple more zings.

1997
01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:08.460
Make the milk. Yes,
he makes the milk.

1998
01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:10.860
You love it. You give
milk to the baby.

1999
01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:13.940
All right. One, two,
three, here we go!

2000
01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:16.140
Come on!

2001
01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.140
We got a couple things
that I know how to do!

2002
01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:21.260
Yes, this is a good
test, so why not?

2003
01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.060
All right. Here we go.

2004
01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:27.620
You're killing him!

2005
01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.820
The sheep lives!
The sheep lives!

2006
01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.620
Yes! Here we go, one more time.

2007
01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.140
Here we go. Yes!

2008
01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:46.460
This is what I did. You saw this.
Yes!

2009
01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.500
Welcome. I am
Tanner Patrick, Jr.

2010
01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:53.100
We're ready for the legendary
Oceano's Hula Competition.

2011
01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:54.740
Legendary?
Never heard of it!

2012
01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:59.260
Legendary like the day you
were once sober. So...

2013
01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:02.940
She talks the talk, who
will walk the walk

2014
01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.860
and walk with me to the Ladies' Lounge?
Feeling it...

2015
01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:07.940
I think you should do it, Devlin.

2016
01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.540
Because she would win.

2017
01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.140
- I'll do it!
- Oh! Good show!

2018
01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:16.340
Katherine? How about you?

2019
01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:19.220
Come on, this isn't Katherine's thing.
Right, Katherine?

2020
01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:23.060
No, no, not my... Her speed.
Not mine.

2021
01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:24.900
Some people are just
more comfortable

2022
01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:26.900
on the sidelines, so
don't judge her, honey.

2023
01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:30.340
Your honesty, your fearlessness,
and your tickle spot.

2024
01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:33.740
Your creativity, your bravery,
and your taffy nipples.

2025
01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:37.020
Let's go! How do I
win this thing?

2026
01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.140
I'm gonna do this hula thing.

2027
01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:40.900
Oh, don't feel any
pressure, Katherine.

2028
01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:43.180
I'm not the one who
should feel the pressure.

2029
01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:50.580
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm
welcome for tonight's hula girls.

2030
01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:57.420
These are my stars.
And here's the key,

2031
01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.900
you decide how brightly
they shine tonight.

2032
01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:02.060
You the audience,
judge and jury.

2033
01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:03.700
I like what I see.

2034
01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:09.060
This is my hula palooza.

2035
01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.140
You're the judges.

2036
01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:14.540
You're voting for your
favorite hula girl.

2037
01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:16.540
How about we do one over here?

2038
01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:19.100
Can I get a little something-something
up here in the corner?

2039
01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:23.340
Has anybody got a
conscience here tonight?

2040
01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.260
Come on, you did well.
You did well.

2041
01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:26.780
Aw!

2042
01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:28.340
It's tough.

2043
01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.420
What do I got over here?
Anybody?

2044
01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.460
How tall do you
think that guy is?

2045
01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:35.460
Who? The Tanner guy?
I don't know.

2046
01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:36.660
Yeah, that Tanner.

2047
01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.500
Looks pretty tall, I'd
say he's like 6'3".

2048
01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:39.700
Yeah, I don't know.

2049
01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.700
Can I get a positive reaction?

2050
01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.460
Thank you.

2051
01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.900
How about this little girl?
Let's make her night. How about it?

2052
01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:51.180
I like it. Keep the mojo going.

2053
01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:52.780
How about Big Country
in the corner?

2054
01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.220
Do I got...

2055
01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.060
Sorry.

2056
01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:58.460
This is fixed!

2057
01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:01.460
Tall fellow is
lucky to get away.

2058
01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.940
Let's pick
up the tempo, boys.

2059
01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:05.540
What? What is that?

2060
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.100
Okay. This is a lot faster.

2061
01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:45.660
Fabulous!

2062
01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:58.780
Yeah, baby!

2063
01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:17.700
What?

2064
01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.500
Come on.

2065
01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:37.900
Nobody got cheated here tonight.

2066
01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:39.620
These are two of
the hottest chicks

2067
01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.460
we have ever had up here.

2068
01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:42.900
But our job is not done.

2069
01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:46.820
I need your help, because
I need a winner.

2070
01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:47.980
Let me hear you.

2071
01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:50.900
Beautiful!

2072
01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:53.260
Wow, that is gonna
be tough to beat.

2073
01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:56.180
Let's not kid anybody.
How about over here?

2074
01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:01.900
There you have it.
We have ourselves...

2075
01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:04.900
That's my Boo-Boo!

2076
01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:08.540
A tie! We have ourselves a tie.

2077
01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:10.900
That's great. We both win.
Good...

2078
01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:12.540
What's the tiebreaker?

2079
01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:15.700
What's the tiebreaker?

2080
01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:19.940
This is how we settle
ties in my house.

2081
01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:22.100
It's something I like to
call Coconut Smoochie.

2082
01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:23.700
The object of the game is,

2083
01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:25.780
the coconut is in
their midsections.

2084
01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:27.660
It must move all the
way up to their mouths

2085
01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:28.930
without the use of their hands.

2086
01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:30.020
Focus, focus.

2087
01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:33.580
If you touch the coconut,
you are disqualified.

2088
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:37.380
Okay. Ready? One, two,
three, get coconutty!

2089
01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:39.420
Okay. Slow.

2090
01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.660
Okay, all right. Calm
down, calm down.

2091
01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:45.010
Let me just bring it up to you.

2092
01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:46.020
Okay, do it.

2093
01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.420
Get it up there. Come on.

2094
01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:49.940
Bring your coconuts down to me.

2095
01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:51.460
Okay. Oh, my coconuts.

2096
01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.260
Pull up. All right. I'm so low.

2097
01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:55.780
Squeeze your coconuts.
Squeeze them.

2098
01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:58.940
Use every crevice you can.
Don't be afraid.

2099
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:00.540
I can't get it up here.

2100
01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:01.940
I'm trying.

2101
01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:03.940
Would you be quiet?

2102
01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:05.980
Stay there. Wait.

2103
01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:08.220
Okay, that's good. Is that good?

2104
01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:09.900
Sorry about this, by the way.

2105
01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:11.450
Really? You're really
sorry about this?

2106
01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:12.820
No, I'm not. I like it.

2107
01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:15.780
Oh, yeah!

2108
01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:17.020
Pick it up, pick it up!

2109
01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:18.940
Not with your
hands, you buffoon!

2110
01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.140
Come on!

2111
01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:23.260
Look what he's doing! What happened?
I can't see.

2112
01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:26.100
Focus. Take it slow,
take it slow.

2113
01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:27.820
He's got it!

2114
01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:32.300
That's not fair.
He can't do that.

2115
01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.180
No, that's a clean
pick-up right there.

2116
01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:36.100
Okay. Bring it over here.

2117
01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:38.780
Go! Go! Go!

2118
01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:40.620
I got it.

2119
01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:45.820
There's still time. Let's go.

2120
01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:47.420
You can touch each other,

2121
01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:48.980
you cannot touch the coconut.

2122
01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.340
Hang on, hang on.

2123
01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.580
- What's going on? What is that?
- What do you use?

2124
01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:55.810
- What's the hold-up?
- You still got that perfume on, huh?

2125
01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:56.860
Would you stop it?

2126
01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:58.140
Smells good. Come on, let's go.

2127
01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:00.180
Have you got it to your
mouth yet, Boo-Boo?

2128
01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:03.900
Stop putting your
ass in my face.

2129
01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:06.500
I like it. That's my girl.
Okay.

2130
01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:12.660
We've got a winner! We have a winner!
We have a winner.

2131
01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:16.020
Coconut Smoochie
champions right here.

2132
01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:18.180
Awesome.

2133
01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:20.220
You suck at everything!

2134
01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:22.660
Boo-Boo.

2135
01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.340
Great teamwork, guys.

2136
01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:25.781
How long have you
two been married?

2137
01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:27.620
Eight years. Ten years.

2138
01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:29.100
Ten years. Eight.

2139
01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:30.900
Very long time.
A very long time.

2140
01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.340
- Did you see the look on her face?
- Yes.

2141
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:35.580
Do you understand what
joy that brought me?

2142
01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.020
How about the look on her face

2143
01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:38.410
when you were doing
the juggling, though?

2144
01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:39.810
The juggling was the
highlight for me.

2145
01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:41.300
That was pretty good.
You liked that?

2146
01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:42.460
It was so cute.

2147
01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.780
And when you talked about
her arms getting done?

2148
01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:46.620
The good news is she's
beating the hell

2149
01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:47.900
out of the iPod guy right now.

2150
01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:49.100
Right now, I know.

2151
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.700
That was good.
That was really fun.

2152
01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:55.380
You know what, I think
that was the first time

2153
01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:56.900
that you and I have ever

2154
01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:01.260
gone out, you know, just us.

2155
01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.740
I know. I do.

2156
01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:04.420
I feel bad for the
Soul Patch now.

2157
01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:06.140
I do.

2158
01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:07.861
Now that you've been
out with a real man.

2159
01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.180
And by a real man,
I mean a man who showers.

2160
01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:15.180
I think it's so adorable

2161
01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:17.740
how obsessed you
are with this guy.

2162
01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:20.210
I just can't picture you guys on
a date, you know what I mean?

2163
01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:21.900
Who said it was a date ever?

2164
01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.420
- You.
- You.

2165
01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.740
You get very excited when
you talk to this man.

2166
01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:29.780
Listen, Dr. Gervitz is moving
his practice to New York City.

2167
01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:30.940
Yeah.

2168
01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:33.580
Brian is not gonna go
with him, and he...

2169
01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:36.460
He's just been asking me if

2170
01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:40.460
I would want to, you
know, replace him.

2171
01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:42.300
You're going?

2172
01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:44.100
No.

2173
01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.940
You can't do that to me.

2174
01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:48.100
I just wanted to see
how you'd react.

2175
01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:50.460
Look at you.
You can't live without me.

2176
01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:52.020
"What do I do?
How do I sign it?"

2177
01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:53.420
"How do I pay for it?"

2178
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.340
No. You kind of played with
me a little bit, though.

2179
01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:59.140
You could've told
me that earlier.

2180
01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:00.660
You're just messing with me?

2181
01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:02.581
Trying to get me a little
jealous, weren't you?

2182
01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.460
No. I just was having
fun teasing you.

2183
01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:08.100
That was fun. Why?
Were you jealous?

2184
01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:11.940
No. Get outta here. Was I jealous?
No.

2185
01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:15.740
Look at you. You're grinning, you
can't stop, what is that smile?

2186
01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:17.300
I didn't know you had
that many teeth.

2187
01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:20.100
I know.
I got like 55 teeth.

2188
01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.740
No. So there's nothing?

2189
01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:26.500
You and...
There's nothing?

2190
01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:27.980
No love connection?

2191
01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:30.380
No. Mmm-mmm. Nothing.

2192
01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.540
Well, then, that's a shame.

2193
01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:33.780
What?

2194
01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:36.860
That coconut getting
in the way tonight.

2195
01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:38.450
- That's a shame, don't you think?
- Oh.

2196
01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:40.020
No. No, that was bad.

2197
01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:41.260
The coconut.

2198
01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:42.690
You're lucky that
coconut was there.

2199
01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:45.660
You couldn't... You wouldn't
have been able to handle it.

2200
01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:47.500
Maybe you're right.

2201
01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:53.340
You got more tricks that
I don't know about?

2202
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:54.620
I don't know.

2203
01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:55.860
Okay.

2204
01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:58.260
I don't know anything.

2205
01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:00.020
Mommy? Mommy?

2206
01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:03.460
Hi, guys!

2207
01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:05.340
Hey! What're you doing?

2208
01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.300
The babysitter fell asleep.

2209
01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:08.540
Oh, great.

2210
01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:09.820
I mean, come on,

2211
01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:11.540
it's like a Hawaiian Rosa, huh?

2212
01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.700
Is it? Oh, my God.

2213
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.020
Yeah, that's asleep.

2214
01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:16.180
Look at that.

2215
01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:22.540
- Wow.
- She's out deep.

2216
01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.180
All right. Good to see you guys.

2217
01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:25.740
Good night.

2218
01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.260
Good job. One more
day of lying, guys.

2219
01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:30.220
We're almost done.
Home stretch.

2220
01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:33.100
All right. So, you
gotta go to sleep.

2221
01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:34.740
Yeah.

2222
01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:36.700
- Tired?
- Yes. Good night.

2223
01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:38.580
- Okay. That was fun.
- Good job.

2224
01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:42.100
- Good night.
- Good night.

2225
01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:44.060
- Good night.
- All right.

2226
01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:45.260
Okay, Danny.

2227
01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:47.900
Okay, good luck.
I'll see you in the morning.

2228
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:12.380
She ain't going to sleep.

2229
01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:25.780
Oh! Hello!
There he is, Danny!

2230
01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.100
It's nice to meet you.

2231
01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:28.420
Where were you going?

2232
01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:29.500
What?

2233
01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:31.500
I was going...
I was going to...

2234
01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:32.700
Where were you guys?

2235
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:34.060
I was looking for you guys at...

2236
01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:35.620
What happened?
How was the dinner?

2237
01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:40.300
Dolph gave mouth-
to-mouth to a sheep.

2238
01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:41.940
Yeah. And then we
had a few drinks.

2239
01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:46.180
Yes. It was choking and
so I gave him sheep-P-R.

2240
01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:50.620
But he was the black
sheep of the family,

2241
01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:54.820
but he was also white,
if that makes any sense.

2242
01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:58.100
And we've been talking about
how amazing this trip has been

2243
01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:00.060
and how amazing you are.

2244
01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.660
Yeah, all joking aside,

2245
01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:03.500
it really has been first-class.

2246
01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:06.700
And that, if the kids and I
hadn't kept you so busy,

2247
01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:08.860
that you might've had the
time to do something

2248
01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:10.700
you've been thinking
about doing?

2249
01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:12.860
The one ringy-dingy?

2250
01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:15.980
Uh... Yeah, you told
her about that?

2251
01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:19.140
I don't need you to
get me a ring, Danny.

2252
01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:21.540
Let's just get married.
Right here.

2253
01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:23.140
What now?

2254
01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:26.980
Why not? We're in Hawaii.
Let's do it tomorrow.

2255
01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:30.060
I mean, this has felt special
from the moment that we met.

2256
01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:32.100
And I've seen the way that
you are with the kids,

2257
01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:34.940
and it's exactly the way I always
imagined my husband would be.

2258
01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:36.900
Oh, man...

2259
01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:39.100
I don't wanna wait.

2260
01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:41.020
I just wanna start
my life with you.

2261
01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:45.740
Hi!

2262
01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:51.420
Hi, everybody! Dolph.

2263
01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:52.980
There you are.

2264
01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:55.100
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

2265
01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:55.972
For me?

2266
01:36:55.997 --> 01:36:58.844
Yes. Come here.
Come on, let's go.

2267
01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:01.020
- No way, we can't go.
- What?

2268
01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:02.660
My little Oompa Loompa.

2269
01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:07.860
Danny and Palmer, they're
getting married tomorrow!

2270
01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:10.380
What?

2271
01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:12.100
No, no, I mean, why?

2272
01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:14.340
Yeah, we are.
But what do you think?

2273
01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:16.340
What do you mean,
what do I think?

2274
01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.460
I mean, what does it
matter what I think?

2275
01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:21.140
I think that's great.

2276
01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:22.860
Thank you, Devlin.

2277
01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:24.980
I really hope that you
can be there tomorrow.

2278
01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:26.540
I can't.

2279
01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:28.380
It's really...

2280
01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:31.420
It's bad luck for the ex
to be at the wedding.

2281
01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:32.700
Come on, Dolph. Let's go.

2282
01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.820
Where are we going?
They are here.

2283
01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:36.060
We gotta have the sweet sex.

2284
01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.580
- What?
- Okay? Come on.

2285
01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:40.420
Okay. Congratulations, though.

2286
01:37:57.820 --> 01:37:59.420
I'm trying
them on as we speak.

2287
01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:00.860
I know, but I just bought them.

2288
01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:04.780
I had some with me and the one
I have on is pretty amazing.

2289
01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:14.060
Michael!

2290
01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:17.900
Nincompoop!

2291
01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:21.060
Nincompoopenschtic!

2292
01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:23.900
Michael, the crap
is the stinking...

2293
01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:40.980
Hello?

2294
01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:42.820
Hey, you up?

2295
01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:47.060
Hi. Yeah. Glad you called.

2296
01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:49.420
Are you?

2297
01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:51.420
Um...

2298
01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:54.340
Yeah, I was, uh, just
checking flights

2299
01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:57.940
for your parents
tomorrow and I found...

2300
01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:00.500
No, no, no. You don't
have to do that.

2301
01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:02.740
Her parents aren't coming in

2302
01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:05.260
and she wants it to
be kind of elope-y.

2303
01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:07.260
Elope-y.

2304
01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.100
Got it.

2305
01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:11.140
Okay, uh, so, are you all set

2306
01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:13.220
for what you need
to wear tomorrow?

2307
01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:16.500
Do you think this
is a good idea?

2308
01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:19.180
What?
The wedding?

2309
01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:23.620
Yeah, the wedding...
Just the whole Palmer thing.

2310
01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:29.620
Well, that's why we
came out here, right?

2311
01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:31.780
I guess.

2312
01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.460
You don't think it's crazy?

2313
01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:42.900
Um, Danny, you don't
need my permission.

2314
01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:46.260
Okay? You're a big boy.

2315
01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:47.980
I know, I just...

2316
01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:54.540
I know if I do this that...

2317
01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:58.500
Just, things could get weird

2318
01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:00.900
between you and me
at the office, so...

2319
01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:04.500
Well, you're not gonna
have to worry about that.

2320
01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:08.660
You going to New York?

2321
01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:11.860
Yeah. I just, you
know, I mean...

2322
01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.340
As much as I was looking
forward to you, um,

2323
01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:18.580
reconstructing my face,

2324
01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:23.020
I really just need to
start fresh, you know?

2325
01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:27.660
Hello, are you there?

2326
01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.140
You understand?

2327
01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:32.820
I guess.

2328
01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:37.180
It's an awful lot of guessing
coming through this phone.

2329
01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:40.540
I've been divorced,
I have two kids,

2330
01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:42.540
I don't have time for guessing.

2331
01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:48.940
Got a big day tomorrow,
Doc, all right?

2332
01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:51.940
So why don't you just get
yourself some sleep?

2333
01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:08.540
So that's it. You have
nothing else to worry about.

2334
01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:10.740
We have the flowers, the
music and the location,

2335
01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:13.140
which is ha-wowie, by the
way, you're gonna love it.

2336
01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.420
I promise you it is going to be

2337
01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:18.460
the most wonderful day of
your life, guaranteed.

2338
01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:20.460
- Devlin.
- Yeah.

2339
01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:21.820
Oh! Palmer! I didn't...

2340
01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:29.820
Well, you just look
absolutely beautiful.

2341
01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:32.300
- Really? Thank you.
- Yes.

2342
01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:34.580
Devlin, can I ask you something?

2343
01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:35.740
'Course.

2344
01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:38.980
Do you still want
to be with Danny?

2345
01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:41.660
Wait. What?

2346
01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:43.300
Because I think that

2347
01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:48.340
he still may be
in love with you.

2348
01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:51.060
Really?

2349
01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:55.260
Why would you think that?

2350
01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:58.740
He's always glowing
when you're around.

2351
01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:02.180
And he laughs at your jokes.
He doesn't laugh at mine.

2352
01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:06.740
Palmer, trust me, there is
nothing between me and Danny.

2353
01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:08.780
We're just, you know,

2354
01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:10.580
we're familiar.

2355
01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:13.780
And you are the girl for him.

2356
01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:16.260
He even told me that last night.

2357
01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:19.940
My God, Devlin, this
is such a relief

2358
01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:23.940
because I could never stand a
chance going up against you.

2359
01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:25.980
Turn around. Tell
me if this fits.

2360
01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:28.180
Put the hanger up your nose.

2361
01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:29.380
Stop!

2362
01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:41.660
Excuse me.

2363
01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:43.220
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2364
01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:44.660
Katherine!

2365
01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:46.340
- Katherine!
- Oh, Devlin.

2366
01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:48.140
That was so much fun last night.

2367
01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:49.300
I know.

2368
01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:52.660
I am still trying to work
out how you cheated.

2369
01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:55.740
I didn't. That's what happened.

2370
01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:58.180
So, where's Danny?

2371
01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:01.500
Devlin...

2372
01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:05.300
Danny's at his wedding.

2373
01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:06.980
Come again?

2374
01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:08.660
I was never married to him.

2375
01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:11.860
All a big lie that I made up.

2376
01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:13.260
Why?

2377
01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:18.500
'Cause I couldn't stand the
thought of you knowing the truth.

2378
01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:19.660
Really?

2379
01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:22.820
So, yeah, I'm a single mother.

2380
01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:24.900
I have two kids that I love

2381
01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:26.380
more than anything in the world.

2382
01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:30.420
I drive a Honda.
Still have dial-up internet.

2383
01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:34.700
I got a 2.7 GPA in
college, not a 3.4.

2384
01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:36.940
And while I'm at it
telling the truth,

2385
01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:38.900
I named my kids' poop after you.

2386
01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:43.500
And I work for Danny.
I'm his assistant.

2387
01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:44.700
That's it.

2388
01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:48.500
Really, I would never
have guessed this.

2389
01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:50.340
I mean, you two had
a real connection.

2390
01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:55.020
He's great.
He's the greatest guy.

2391
01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:59.620
And I might even be
in love with him,

2392
01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:02.620
but that doesn't really
matter at this moment

2393
01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:07.100
because he is getting married
to another person right now.

2394
01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:11.220
Ian and I are breaking up.

2395
01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:15.260
What?
What happened?

2396
01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:18.740
Well, for starters, he's gay.

2397
01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:20.020
He's gay?

2398
01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.660
I mean, look at him.

2399
01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:23.820
That's a strong
muscle right there.

2400
01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.380
I'm squeezing.

2401
01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:27.340
Devlin, I gotta tell you,

2402
01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:30.300
last night, with the ass
grab of the coconut,

2403
01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:32.380
little bit of a red flag.

2404
01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:36.100
I've seen him do
that with the soap.

2405
01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:44.420
What about the iPod?

2406
01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:46.260
Oh, he didn't invent shit.

2407
01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:47.580
He didn't?

2408
01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:50.300
No! He made his money
suing the Dodgers

2409
01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:52.500
after he got hit by a foul ball.

2410
01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:57.300
Oh, God! That's so... What?

2411
01:45:58.300 --> 01:45:59.940
Well, this is different.

2412
01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:05.020
Yeah, why didn't we try this
truth-telling thing before?

2413
01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:06.860
I don't know.

2414
01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:09.580
- Hey.
- Hey.

2415
01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:11.860
What?

2416
01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:13.180
That's nice.

2417
01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:15.460
It's nice to tell the truth.
That's good.

2418
01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.060
The truth is fun, isn't it?

2419
01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:18.620
Like, were you telling the truth

2420
01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:20.380
when you said you might
be in love with me?

2421
01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:22.940
- I'm gonna leave you two.
- Okay.

2422
01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:24.980
- I'm gonna go get a divorce.
- Good luck.

2423
01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:32.940
Wait, where are my kids?

2424
01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:35.780
Palmer took them
out for ice cream.

2425
01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:38.900
So, how was the wedding?

2426
01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:40.340
Okay. All right.

2427
01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:43.580
So, we're standing on top
of this beautiful cliff.

2428
01:46:43.605 --> 01:46:44.404
Uh-huh.

2429
01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:47.740
I start looking out
into the Pacific,

2430
01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:49.380
and I think to myself,

2431
01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:54.260
"Wow. I am about
to start my life"

2432
01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:56.380
"with the one I love."

2433
01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:00.140
And the only problem was,

2434
01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:02.660
the one I love was not with me.

2435
01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:05.060
She wasn't?

2436
01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:06.340
She was not.

2437
01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:09.140
So you didn't?

2438
01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:10.540
I couldn't.

2439
01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:11.820
You couldn't.

2440
01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:16.820
I mean, don't we
have something extra

2441
01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:18.220
happening with us?

2442
01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:21.540
Danny, I...

2443
01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:27.220
What happens when we're
not on fake-cation

2444
01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:30.460
and you wake up and
realize this is real?

2445
01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:33.540
You are the only real thing
I've ever had in my life.

2446
01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:35.900
Danny, come on, man. I don't...

2447
01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:39.100
She's beautiful and she's...
I'm not twenty-three.

2448
01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:42.860
I'm not that.

2449
01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:44.980
She's good, she's very nice,

2450
01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:47.740
there's only one problem.
She's not you.

2451
01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:49.060
She's not you.

2452
01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:51.740
I have two kids.

2453
01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:55.420
I can't just drive them off a cliff.
You know?

2454
01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:57.180
I love those kids

2455
01:47:57.260 --> 01:47:59.300
more than anything in
the world, Guv'nor.

2456
01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:04.300
No, I wanna be with those
guys like 23 hours a day.

2457
01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:06.540
What about the other hour?

2458
01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:19.260
Good job!

2459
01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:20.980
That's what I'm talking about.

2460
01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:22.420
Whatever!

2461
01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.421
Well,
everything turned out

2462
01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:30.620
pretty good for everybody.

2463
01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:33.660
Squirt got to swim
with the dolphins.

2464
01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:40.140
Palmer met some tennis player her
own age on the plane ride home,

2465
01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:42.620
who's an even bigger
fan of 'N Sync.

2466
01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:46.940
And Maggie's about to start
a three-week acting class

2467
01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:49.260
with the actual Dolph Lundgren.

2468
01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:52.300
And what happened for me?

2469
01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:55.780
Well, I'm finally wearing
my wedding ring for real.

2470
01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:57.860
And now when women
ask me about it,

2471
01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:00.140
I'm gonna tell them I'm
married to a woman

2472
01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:02.940
who doesn't beat me,
doesn't cheat on me,

2473
01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:06.060
doesn't drink... Well,
doesn't drink that much.

2474
01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:09.020
And who I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with.

2475
01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:11.860
A woman named Katherine.

2476
01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:15.220
Would you like to dance with
your wife, Doctor Maccabee?

2477
01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:17.540
Yes, I would, Mrs. Maccabee.

2478
01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:19.000
Yeah, it's okay.

2479
01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:22.660
One more.

2480
01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:31.020
You were right, Soul Patch
is going hard on that bass.

2481
01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:32.740
- What did I tell you?
- Uh-huh.

2482
01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:38.500
- Hey. Encore, man. I'm just kidding.
- Stop.

2483
01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:45.860
- I get it.
- It is long and it's gross.

2484
01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:48.700
You don't need wind for
that thing to swing around.
