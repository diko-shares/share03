00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.145
JUST GO WITH IT

2
00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.630
I'm so glad
that you chose this dress.

3
00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:49.049
- You're very beautiful.
- Do not you?

4
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:53.011
Girls, get married!
I'm married!

5
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:59.685
- Not without a veil. Where is it?
- I think I let up.

6
00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:05.107
Do not worry.
I'm going to pick me, sister.

7
00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:13.657
- It's incredibly annoying.
- And incredibly ugly.

8
00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:18.203
- Looks like Karl Malden.
- And my sister will be in an hour!

9
00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:22.165
- How do you reconcile that?
- Close your eyes only for Danny.

10
00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:26.253
I do not want to have scarcely tangenюe
his family of clowns.

11
00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:30.299
- Sure you will agree with that?
- Danny never refuse me.

12
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.260
Believe me, I've trained well.

13
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:38.056
Tell us what happened
Eric last night?

14
00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:43.312
I told him that if he
to stop wedding

15
00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.647
to talk now
or be silent forever.

16
00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.984
- And what did he say?
- He said that the standby will not settle to his house.

17
00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:50.944
Said to marry Danny.

18
00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:54.865
- Thi and gave a wedding gift?
- Bitch what you're horny!

19
00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:58.410
I think you can tell him and the and a.

20
00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:05.667
- It's the last time, I swear.
- Sure.

21
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:10.172
Danny's has a nice and careful with me and
and will reach a cardiologist.

22
00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:14.635
So A and marry him...
And with that beam in the middle Fethi.

23
00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:15.636
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

24
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:19.014
<i>- Close your eyes when on top.
- And when it's underneath.</i>

25
00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.352
Cousin, I'm terribly sorry.

26
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.440
<i>What ugly, it hurt. That was me,
Danny Maccabee, 20 years ago.</i>

27
00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:29.900
<i>Ridiculous, right?</i>

28
00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:35.030
<i>Almost finished
I drink to all the bitter,</i>

29
00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:37.824
<i>when something interesting happened.</i>

30
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:43.080
Honey, you're like a cake.
Hot and sweet.

31
00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:50.587
Mommy, of course trumpet Cantha
that make me grow my "standard of living."

32
00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:56.343
Thi-po fell and eta.

33
00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:59.429
Can I stay below 10 seconds
without someone to give me? Thanks.

34
00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.976
Just tell you that thi-po fell and eta.

35
00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:09.982
- I'm sorry, I...
- It's nothing.

36
00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:14.570
I'm sure you have not met his wife Thi
in such a degrading bar.

37
00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:18.240
- In the cafeteria at school.
- Since you are married?

38
00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:22.077
<i>I wanted to tell, really wanted...</i>

39
00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:24.663
<i>But I wanted to know
and the one I'm a loser</i>

40
00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:26.874
<i>to so I modeled a little truth.</i>

41
00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:30.002
- For six years.
- And where is it tonight?

42
00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:34.173
We stopped to ask me more
this question long ago.

43
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.465
Horrible.

44
00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:39.428
I say that too much work
to bring money home for her

45
00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.807
and shopping for her dependence
and drugs as well.

46
00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.063
- Why you do not exits?
- Children... All 14.

47
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:56.069
I like and do not want to adopt
Do I stop this.

48
00:03:56.695 --> 00:04:00.616
Sгrгcuюul you.
Want to get out of here?

49
00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.494
<i>And I found the standby
power of the ring.</i>

50
00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:08.957
<i>Symbol became a tool of my humility
that I had to return.</i>

51
00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.376
You move to me?
With this?

52
00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:16.131
<i>I changed my major,
from cardiology to cosmetic operations.</i>

53
00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:20.511
<i>I escaped to the front and cocoa
and the ring has become the subject of my work.</i>

54
00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:24.806
I assumed that after we were married,
will cease to use the drug.

55
00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.770
You need to put the ring
a true heart.

56
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.730
This is a very pleasant time.

57
00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:35.776
Yes. Let's go do it
Hold more?

58
00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.445
Okay, let's go... You.

59
00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:44.076
<i>Sometimes I think
to throw it into the ocean,</i>

60
00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.954
<i>I know it's not doing well,
but can not.</i>

61
00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:50.040
<i>My preюiosul E!</i>

62
00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:53.836
<i>Plus that this false marriage
is a perfect way</i>

63
00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:56.922
<i>to make sure that nobody
will not break my heart again.</i>

64
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.008
<i>Cindy, I had a wonderful evening!</i>

65
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.095
<i>PS Thank you that you did not beat,
the way it makes my wife.</i>

66
00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:10.602
What are these?

67
00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:18.652
Bags breasts, women and bring them
in chests and flat and they do great.

68
00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:22.948
These are not bags
they asked.

69
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.035
What's this? Looks like the syrup container
the restaurant. E. Do not understand why

70
00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.872
What the hell. These do not feel like this.

71
00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:34.960
- Really?
- And I'm trying to learn.

72
00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:39.173
Listen, do not support Dr. Maccabee
someone so rigid breasts.

73
00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:40.549
Please bring good to me
I ordered

74
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:43.677
and tell him that I discount Omar
for this mess.

75
00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:45.179
Thanks, Simon.

76
00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:49.391
- I came up programming at 16?
- Yes, a camera, Christine Grant, do not laugh.

77
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.398
Well, we had
an aesthetic operation Failed.

78
00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.651
Ought to realize
that was a doctor of anything,

79
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.362
- Take office as a deposit.
- I understand, understand.

80
00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:06.450
Do you have any questions?

81
00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:09.161
No. Just beautiful please
ajutaюi to me, Doctor.

82
00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:13.707
Sure. It is usually easier
when you do it for the first time, but...

83
00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.794
What is it? Pгreюi you have any doubts.

84
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.132
No, not at all.
I heard that you are the best.

85
00:06:22.174 --> 00:06:24.009
I do not know if the best, but...

86
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.554
I think we will succeed to find a solution.

87
00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:33.268
Relaxaюi sure. Relaxaюi sure.
That means relaxed?

88
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:39.733
Station to drag down a bit.
Well, jumped back, up.

89
00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.862
- Sorry.
- Why?

90
00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:45.489
God!

91
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.826
- It's incredibly high.
- Yes. It is very high.

92
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.663
You must be careful,
will remain caught in the hair.

93
00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:58.377
Maybe we should just leave the standby a.
It seems that you and others оnvesele it.

94
00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:02.339
No, no. But seriously, you are available
the day my child?

95
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:05.050
- Sorry.
- That was too much.

96
00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:06.844
Come to hug you ez.
For this you need first.

97
00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:13.517
Dear God.
I'll go, Excuse me.

98
00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:15.853
Ding Dong!

99
00:07:16.812 --> 00:07:19.273
- It's Eddie.
- My cousin.

100
00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:26.488
God. Eyebrows crazy.
I kinda liked. What are you doing later?

101
00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:30.242
Sorry. I am in a relationship
with anyone else.

102
00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:38.750
Lord. I do not know with who you are
in a relationship, but certainly not what I got.

103
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.962
- Down there, I understand?
- Ready Eddie.

104
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.965
Yes, it is very good.
I know, I just installed it.

105
00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:49.136
- Thi-you did a penis enlarge?
- Yes.

106
00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:53.015
People really do that?
It's incredible and something.

107
00:07:53.015 --> 00:07:55.058
We see the program, Dr. Maccabee.

108
00:07:57.895 --> 00:08:01.481
Dude, why tell them all
About My Operation?

109
00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:04.818
You want to hide the secret of this?
You know and Katherine knows about it.

110
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.615
- Katherine was there with a magnifying glass.
- And with tweezers.

111
00:08:10.616 --> 00:08:13.327
- Very nice.
- You got to try it?

112
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:18.624
Yes. I оnюepat some little girl,
I will not lie.

113
00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:24.546
- Really?
- No meat and bones. More puppet i.

114
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:38.810
- Addon! Hello.
- Danny! Glad you could come.

115
00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.604
- What are you doing?
- You brought up some Botox?

116
00:08:40.646 --> 00:08:42.940
I brought botox, but I brought
on my side the cousins, Eddie.

117
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.525
Nice acquainted.

118
00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:47.528
- This is somehow a Halloween party?
- You move to me?

119
00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:52.699
- Thi've worked a little face, I see.
- Just a little. Only conservation.

120
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:57.871
I just want to maintain IM in the game.
I do not want nothing serious, just someone adventures.

121
00:08:57.913 --> 00:09:01.708
But you have your stops, however i.
May Оюi feel even a little face?

122
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.546
Only in this small area.
From the eyebrows down, absolutely nothing.

123
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.387
- You hear the alarm of cars?
- Laugh, laugh.

124
00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:16.598
I wanted to go to your cousin,
but he refused to operate on me.

125
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.312
- I wanted to mвnuюele and dirty.
- It becomes dangerous. You have to your stops.

126
00:09:23.522 --> 00:09:25.566
See that?
Should not happen.

127
00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:27.401
Adon? Adon!?

128
00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:29.236
Ariel knee was cut to the bone.

129
00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:30.571
- What happened?
- Looks awful.

130
00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.322
Lini and you and you up. What do you do?

131
00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:36.118
- Bleeding.
- Could I, I bind myself. Bring me the bag.

132
00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.663
- So you fell off the stairs?
- Yes.

133
00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:44.293
And you have prevented something
any skateboard?

134
00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:48.338
- No. Something distracted my attention.
- What?

135
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.465
- A girl.
- Well, a girl.

136
00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:53.385
- It's your mother?
- No!

137
00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:57.306
- Looks good. Basically, it's stepmother.
- No, no.

138
00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:59.808
It will not hurt bad,
not think about pain.

139
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.396
I told you not to your mind.
Think you to your face. Good.

140
00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:06.648
Blonde? Brunette? Ro and how much?

141
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:12.196
Blonde, tan, tall,
lightning body.

142
00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.114
Nipples...

143
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.117
May Amorth want to tell you and something else?
I see that you become passionate about.

144
00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.911
No, no, I'm fine.

145
00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:21.497
I'm alive!
I am alive, folks.

146
00:10:32.591 --> 00:10:35.552
Well done, doctor.
That was very nice.

147
00:10:35.594 --> 00:10:37.721
Let me guess.
You're the one that has distracted attention.

148
00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:41.391
- Who?
- That's why he fell, he was distracted attention.

149
00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:43.727
So it's my fault.

150
00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:46.605
Yes. Basically, you push the stairs
You look and because of the well.

151
00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:50.901
- I do not feel guilty, cicгlitorule.
- A and to speak in Gossip Girl now?

152
00:10:52.194 --> 00:10:54.613
And I knew you two you'll meet
eventually.

153
00:10:54.613 --> 00:10:59.993
But beware, Palmer, doctors knew г
aestheticians know very well to handle.

154
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.171
I do not know what to say
with this aesthetic surgery.

155
00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:15.050
- Does not look always false?
- Depends on who does it. I'm pretty good.

156
00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:18.929
Some of my pacienюii are here
tonight. See if I can find.

157
00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:22.057
- Well...
- Someone to look decent.

158
00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:25.644
- It?
- The lady in the "Saw"?

159
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.313
Well, tell me who you run.

160
00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:32.442
I hate that you need to pour,
but you see them on over there?

161
00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:33.861
Funduleю sexy?

162
00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:37.531
When I met him,
was of a piece.

163
00:11:37.531 --> 00:11:39.700
- Really?
- Bottom hung them up to the ankles.

164
00:11:40.284 --> 00:11:42.619
Put the bottom on the toilet immediately.

165
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.372
I know it's bad for me,
but it's too funny, right?

166
00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:50.085
So, you're in North Carolina.
How long you live here in LA?

167
00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:53.714
- I've been here almost a year.
- That many sites audiюii and casting.

168
00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:56.758
- You think you are actress?
- I can guarantee you're actress.

169
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.803
May guess and you, Doctor,
matics at the 6th grade.

170
00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:03.015
In North Carolina schools did
from which to teach?

171
00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:08.896
My parents divorced when I was
8th grade, to exit it really bad.

172
00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:13.108
I'm tired of being
one side and another,

173
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:18.739
standby So I thought to change something
and I moved to Los Angeles.

174
00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:21.366
You came right place,
divorюeazг nobody here.

175
00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:26.872
I have never exit it with a girl
your age. It's very nice.

176
00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:31.877
- No, already your first lie.
- You're good.

177
00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:37.508
Well. I have not ever exit it with a girl
and your age and understanding to us

178
00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:43.597
Understanding the way it us us now. In fact,
with any girl I had not realized the and the good.

179
00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:48.685
I realize the minds
and when you tell the truth.

180
00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:54.274
- The second thing is true.
- I know.

181
00:13:06.495 --> 00:13:09.581
God, was the most extraordinary
night of my life.

182
00:13:10.332 --> 00:13:16.338
Yes, there could be
something real between us.

183
00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:19.758
Something certainly is, Palmer.

184
00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:23.554
You must get to work,
but how about give me your number

185
00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:26.849
Scotland and a meeting I can
true next time?

186
00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:30.602
I have a business card in your pocket
if you lie down after her.

187
00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:35.732
You better call me. I hope
to me and not to wait by the phone.

188
00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:39.403
Thi has and give it to myself but I
the light to see me naked.

189
00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.530
Could you drop me all the chances.

190
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.662
What's this?

191
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.831
A circle?

192
00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:55.919
- A wedding ring? You're married?
- No, not married.

193
00:13:56.587 --> 00:13:59.214
That e. .. Not mine.

194
00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:02.926
Whose wedding
in your pants, Danny?

195
00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:06.889
Listen to me, just...
Give me a minute to explain the situation.

196
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.640
Please nice.

197
00:14:09.183 --> 00:14:12.352
- It will take more than a minute.
- I am the one and the bad!

198
00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:14.771
- No, no, no.
- Do not call me.

199
00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:17.149
There... Palmer!

200
00:14:20.319 --> 00:14:25.365
I told that whole thing with
fake marriage will backfire.

201
00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:28.702
- Why not tell the truth?
- Do you think that I can tell the truth?

202
00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:33.499
- Keep practicing. You'll get it.
- Move to. Wait a little.

203
00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:38.420
Good. There is a standby,
but in any case...

204
00:14:39.296 --> 00:14:42.633
- I'm wearing a wedding ring sometimes false...
- You're a pig.

205
00:14:44.343 --> 00:14:46.595
- Sorry. You're a pig.
- Going to work.

206
00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:51.600
- What happened? You have a strange walk.
- I'm back hurts, I slept on the beach.

207
00:14:52.476 --> 00:14:55.437
When you have to tell you strengthens your column?
Seriously. Flow Max.

208
00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:58.440
You need to do more exercise
once a month.

209
00:14:58.482 --> 00:15:01.401
- I can not. I have no time.
- I have. Do not say that, Danny.

210
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.240
Mother always said that the Carey Grant
exercise was not just climb stairs.

211
00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.033
Every day, never take no elevator.

212
00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:10.244
Want to learn how to imitate
Carey Grant's butler?

213
00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.703
- Look.
- Let me see.

214
00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:15.624
Hello? No, he died.
Well. Goodbye.

215
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.253
- E Well, it's funny.
- Mom, give me some money.

216
00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:21.296
Hello. What are you doing?

217
00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:25.175
Nice to see you. Be political and
and Dr Maccabee salutaюi it.

218
00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:28.136
Hello, Doctor Danny.
How do you feel today?

219
00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:31.056
Somehow trying to impress me?
What speaks to you?

220
00:15:31.098 --> 00:15:36.478
- Work at some highlights.
- I take theater classes this summer.

221
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.939
I'll be the next Miley Cyrus.

222
00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:41.900
But you, young man?
Thiele you like Hannah Montana?

223
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.864
- No, I like Californication.
- When you look you in Californication?

224
00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:49.867
Rose let us forget the channel
Showtime when she and boyfriend sounds.

225
00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:53.036
Eat the mushroom! And ah!

226
00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:55.914
It appears that you have more per capita.

227
00:15:55.956 --> 00:15:57.875
- Dr Danny?
- Yes.

228
00:15:57.916 --> 00:16:03.797
- I'm going to Hawaii to swim with dolphins?
- Do you go to Hawaii? No.

229
00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:06.258
I saw a documentary on Discovery.

230
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.345
They said that if you pay money
there are dolphins that can swim.

231
00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:12.514
- Well...
- I have no money.

232
00:16:12.556 --> 00:16:14.683
But Mom says you're rich.

233
00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:16.268
- Michael!
- It's nothing.

234
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.981
Perhaps, as you should only tigi money.
To sell lemonade or something like that.

235
00:16:21.023 --> 00:16:26.028
The rich do not offer tours
as lollipops, that's why remain rich.

236
00:16:26.028 --> 00:16:26.987
You understand?

237
00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:30.532
But mom says that charities do
Children almost always.

238
00:16:30.574 --> 00:16:34.703
I do my job
such as to fix a disability.

239
00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:38.790
Do not go to Hawaii.
A and could be arrested for it.

240
00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:42.461
And if the standby and I have been with disabilities?
Did you go to Hawaii?

241
00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:47.382
In this case, and leads you up and let you standby
there because I'd like to watch you.

242
00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:49.635
Okay, forget the money.
I want to get my rest.

243
00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:53.388
And I want to say that you ate
food paid with money knew.

244
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.183
<i>Mom, before we left,
I can go to do a Devlin?</i>

245
00:16:56.225 --> 00:16:59.978
Sure. In the hall. Go with him
Please open in 5 minutes

246
00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:03.690
- And you will not want to sit and no one there.
- Of course I go, mгmicuюг.

247
00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:06.109
Bravo. E following
Winston Churchill, this girl.

248
00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.362
<i>He said he wants to do a Devlin.
What does that mean?</i>

249
00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:14.827
It's a friend of mine
Devlin Adams named college.

250
00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.038
I'd say he was a friend,
more than my rival.

251
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.833
- So it was a close enemy.
- Yes.

252
00:17:20.833 --> 00:17:23.544
Thi probably would like. It is very false.

253
00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:27.756
Always had to have clothes
most move to, those sexy boys...

254
00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:31.134
- I worried.
- Very much.

255
00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:34.721
- One evening, drinking a glass of wine...
- A glass.

256
00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:37.307
A glass. And i. ..

257
00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:40.894
I'm sick children
at the shower and bathroom.

258
00:17:40.936 --> 00:17:42.855
You have to make poop
or bowel.

259
00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:46.108
<i>So A and I told them that reads:
Make a Devlin.</i>

260
00:17:46.692 --> 00:17:49.403
They liked it and the standby has remained.

261
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.738
<i>To me it was said:
Make black pick.</i>

262
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.698
What to do?!

263
00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:55.200
- I say this... compared with the others.
- Loud? Very good.

264
00:17:55.576 --> 00:17:57.536
What about my love life?

265
00:17:57.578 --> 00:18:02.332
Danny, I'm sorry you were
I would even care if a little

266
00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:05.043
of success for you to sleep with women
and 20-odd years.

267
00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:07.129
Holy Devlin, I do not listen at all.

268
00:18:07.129 --> 00:18:13.135
This is not an adventure,
is something serious between us.

269
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:17.472
I swear that I see a seated
to my home girl.

270
00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:21.977
You're right, you can not tell you the truth.

271
00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:25.564
- I scored!
- Dear God. Excuse me.

272
00:18:26.148 --> 00:18:28.192
At least someone is doing well.

273
00:18:28.734 --> 00:18:32.613
You know what? You do not want to get involved seriously
because it leads to marriage,

274
00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:35.073
then marriage leads to divorce
then divorce is...

275
00:18:35.866 --> 00:18:39.369
Look at the poor children.
Their father had to take them today.

276
00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:41.038
- Did not come?
- Again.

277
00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:44.958
But even I was inspired
and I divorced him.

278
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.959
Yes, yes.

279
00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:49.963
to wait a little.

280
00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:58.472
I can not believe.

281
00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.974
Palmer, Palmer!

282
00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:04.603
- I told that I do not want to see you.
- I just want to tell you explain something.

283
00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:06.772
Hold me explain something to tell you.

284
00:19:09.483 --> 00:19:12.611
I do not meet men оnsuraюi.
And my father deceived the mother.

285
00:19:12.611 --> 00:19:16.949
- I'll be the other woman.
- Husband of adultery! Sinner!

286
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:21.537
- Take it easy, Damian. Okay?
- Silas calls THEM and not I put into this.

287
00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:25.666
- It's gonna kill you!
- What? Whenever you want.

288
00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:30.754
Listen. Yes, I'm married.
But it's a horrible marriage.

289
00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:34.758
- Do not even talk with me.
- That all men say оnsuraюi.

290
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.345
- If it has and the bad, why not divorce?
- I do.

291
00:19:39.638 --> 00:19:42.432
- Divorce?
- Yes. It's over.

292
00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:45.727
Lord, I do not believe it.
I ruined a marriage!

293
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.606
- I feel that we'll є.
- No. It was not because of you.

294
00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:52.568
I filed divorce
long time ago.

295
00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:57.823
A few days to sign documents
and will be like and dead to me.

296
00:19:58.282 --> 00:20:00.742
- How a name?
- Ms. Maccabee.

297
00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:04.163
I was wondering the name?

298
00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:06.290
First name is Devlin.

299
00:20:07.124 --> 00:20:09.877
- Her name Devlin?
- It's not the name so it's a crap?

300
00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:15.591
But, unfortunately,
Devlin and I are broke.

301
00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:19.595
Because I caught it
elвndu and me in another.

302
00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:25.142
I got a plan. They got it
making a show and head.

303
00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:29.438
I told them not to give television
because... It was too painful.

304
00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:33.734
Even burned and the box can not see.
I would like very much to see.

305
00:20:34.193 --> 00:20:38.655
- It's another man in the middle?
- Yes, it's someone else. Dolph.

306
00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:42.284
- Dolph?
- Dolph Lundgren.

307
00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:47.331
- The guy from Rocky 4?
- No, another Dolph Lundgren.

308
00:20:47.873 --> 00:20:51.502
It seems that if you mentioned it,
very bad guy mad.

309
00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:52.336
The so that may not be mentioned.

310
00:20:52.503 --> 00:20:56.215
Men always say that and
will leave their wives. Never do it.

311
00:20:56.215 --> 00:20:59.885
I'll tell you he's happy with that.
Now I want and I want to be happy.

312
00:20:59.927 --> 00:21:02.763
Only if you are you can be happy.

313
00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:04.431
Okay?

314
00:21:04.473 --> 00:21:10.020
I want to be able to be with you without
to be told adultery or sinner,

315
00:21:10.062 --> 00:21:12.564
or what was said there that kid.

316
00:21:13.524 --> 00:21:15.609
- Okay.
- Okay?

317
00:21:15.901 --> 00:21:17.444
I just want to hear from her and that.

318
00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:21.323
What about the message? It would be fine
would you get if you would send a message?

319
00:21:21.365 --> 00:21:22.324
I want to meet with her.

320
00:21:28.247 --> 00:21:29.748
Let's do it.

321
00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:32.084
- Want to be your wife?
- Yes.

322
00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.086
Could not you think you're

Divorce because you're greedy

It's amazing.
I love shoes to death.

389
00:25:58.183 --> 00:26:01.520
It took about five pairs
maybe give one to tell you.

390
00:26:02.855 --> 00:26:06.358
Henderson, see where is Dr. Maccabee?

391
00:26:06.984 --> 00:26:10.612
Here it is. Hold the engine running,
should not take long.

392
00:26:10.988 --> 00:26:12.739
Hello, plictisitorule.

393
00:26:12.781 --> 00:26:16.493
- Good. You rented limo?
- Dance Theatre only.

394
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.455
Palmer! Hello.

395
00:26:20.455 --> 00:26:23.417
<i>Devlin Maccabee.
Future single-bee.</i>

396
00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:26.837
Waiter! Excuse me.

397
00:26:26.879 --> 00:26:28.881
- Anybody?
- Yes.

398
00:26:28.922 --> 00:26:34.011
- Would you like something to drink, ma'am?
- Good. I'd like a glass of you.

399
00:26:34.052 --> 00:26:36.013
Is it possible?

400
00:26:37.097 --> 00:26:39.766
Just kidding. Or not, if you might be interested.

401
00:26:40.434 --> 00:26:46.440
Again, kidding. I did not.
I do not know, martini, whatever, I always get.

402
00:26:48.066 --> 00:26:51.403
Do not be a virgin martini.
Okay?

403
00:26:52.154 --> 00:26:56.241
So Palmer, I heard
that you had sex with Danny.

404
00:27:00.245 --> 00:27:06.251
- Yes. I'm terribly sorry...
- You please, dear, nothing.

405
00:27:06.627 --> 00:27:09.880
Nice to hear
I still toy that anymore.

406
00:27:10.589 --> 00:27:15.928
Because PE is a serious problem with

407
00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.513
Side the Lord and here.

408
00:27:17.804 --> 00:27:21.767
- What is EP?
- Oh, I forgot that you have 15 years.

409
00:27:23.685 --> 00:27:26.396
Premature ejaculation, my dear.

410
00:27:26.438 --> 00:27:29.816
Think about yourself, you play darts,
You need to have good arrows.

411
00:27:29.858 --> 00:27:34.071
In him were more
spaghetti someone mole and knives.

412
00:27:34.655 --> 00:27:40.077
Well. I think not my spaghetti
liked the meatballs that were served.

413
00:27:40.118 --> 00:27:42.579
They were a little stumpy.

414
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:48.627
We heard from many men that serve
best dumplings in California.

415
00:27:48.836 --> 00:27:52.422
Sure.
Many have said that heaven and ETOR.

416
00:27:52.464 --> 00:27:54.466
They do not have enough to eat.

417
00:27:55.676 --> 00:28:01.682
I wonder-Thi, remember that those with whom
you were, how many pills you take.

418
00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:06.311
I like little pills. I came home
and wondering what's for dinner.

419
00:28:06.562 --> 00:28:09.022
I said that we
pills purple, green,

420
00:28:09.147 --> 00:28:13.777
someone soothing yellow
just baked.

421
00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:15.529
You remember?

422
00:28:15.571 --> 00:28:20.576
I had to do something to entertain me
while he sat on his throne

423
00:28:20.617 --> 00:28:24.246
hours due
movements of the stomach.

424
00:28:24.288 --> 00:28:26.206
I have another illness, very well.

425
00:28:26.248 --> 00:28:31.962
We spent our wedding eve
sitting on the bed and listening

426
00:28:32.004 --> 00:28:36.049
an aquatic symphony

427
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:41.221
The French horns and drums
coming from our bathroom.

428
00:28:41.263 --> 00:28:45.642
May mix and a cat smell
dead and spicy food

429
00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:50.689
and say that you can libido
extremely reduced.

430
00:28:52.983 --> 00:28:57.404
- I just kicked you?
- No. You were? Why did you hit her?

431
00:28:57.446 --> 00:29:01.825
What? Yes. I do not know. I hit.
We bite of chili leg spasms.

432
00:29:04.369 --> 00:29:08.499
It's a horrible side effect
from all those pills,

433
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.336
but everything is better now
do not use and I apologize.

434
00:29:12.377 --> 00:29:13.295
It's nothing.

435
00:29:13.337 --> 00:29:15.756
E phase with the number 13
of addiction. Back to drink.

436
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:20.302
Henderson, stop sending messages
and open the door a.

437
00:29:20.594 --> 00:29:22.638
- Why do I say Henderson?
- Enter the dance and silent.

438
00:29:22.846 --> 00:29:27.768
- Palmer was a pleasure to meet you.
- Also.

439
00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:29.561
Take a look at you two.

440
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.900
Park have to be Barbie
and Gepeto old man.

441
00:29:37.069 --> 00:29:43.033
Although it did not work between us,
absolutely not...

442
00:29:43.242 --> 00:29:45.953
- Like it has not happened.
- Just and E.

443
00:29:45.994 --> 00:29:48.622
All I want my Danny
to be happy.

444
00:29:48.664 --> 00:29:49.957
- How nice of you.
- Happy, happy, happy.

445
00:29:49.957 --> 00:29:52.125
- Good night, kid toaico.
- Okay. Hello?

446
00:29:53.293 --> 00:29:55.212
- I think it's her drug dealer.
- What?

447
00:29:55.712 --> 00:29:57.840
Please nice to give me the phone.

448
00:29:57.881 --> 00:29:59.091
You move to the right, sweetie?

449
00:29:59.132 --> 00:30:04.179
You know I do not like you sell
Your brother's stuff on Ebay.

450
00:30:04.221 --> 00:30:08.058
- Get in the car.
- No, no, no. Not problem.

451
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.895
We talk when I get home,
Lord and everything. Well.

452
00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.690
You'd think that...

453
00:30:17.442 --> 00:30:19.486
You have children?

454
00:30:21.655 --> 00:30:23.740
You have children together?

455
00:30:24.241 --> 00:30:29.037
We, somehow...
We have someone a little child.

456
00:30:29.037 --> 00:30:32.958
- When were you going to tell me them?
- I do not know, but listen.

457
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.254
I must go, to reach
the plight of the home.

458
00:30:37.296 --> 00:30:39.590
It's a pleasure.
Danny...

459
00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:43.802
No, no, no.

460
00:30:47.723 --> 00:30:52.978
- You're scared, that's the situation now?
- In fact, the opposite.

461
00:30:52.978 --> 00:30:58.192
- The opposite of scary? I mean it's good?
- You know I love children.

462
00:30:58.525 --> 00:31:01.695
I imagine I'm not
to be a lover of children.

463
00:31:01.737 --> 00:31:04.865
I am a huge lover.
Only children think.

464
00:31:05.657 --> 00:31:07.618
That's my label.
Can I write my forehead.

465
00:31:07.826 --> 00:31:11.079
- How do you name?
- Start and name.

466
00:31:11.705 --> 00:31:17.669
The girl is called... Kiki D

467
00:31:18.003 --> 00:31:21.215
and the boy his name Bar...

468
00:31:21.757 --> 00:31:25.260
Short for Bardo.

469
00:31:25.302 --> 00:31:28.430
- I want to know.
- Of course you do.

470
00:31:28.972 --> 00:31:32.184
- So my mother did not know that we've got today?
- Not yet.

471
00:31:32.226 --> 00:31:35.854
- You know that means kidnapping?
- Danger stranger.

472
00:31:35.896 --> 00:31:39.942
- What? No.
- Will come the guy at the show on NBC?

473
00:31:39.983 --> 00:31:44.029
No! We both know
long. E and Rose here...

474
00:31:46.448 --> 00:31:50.244
- It makes it normal.
- God, it has and the strange.

475
00:31:50.285 --> 00:31:51.870
Remember what's up.

476
00:31:51.912 --> 00:31:57.167
You wish you an afternoon prefaceюi
that you are my children?

477
00:31:57.751 --> 00:32:00.045
Why not tell the poor girl the truth?

478
00:32:00.087 --> 00:32:03.006
- You know?
- My mom says it all.

479
00:32:03.048 --> 00:32:04.967
- Bгieюelule the ring.
- What?

480
00:32:05.008 --> 00:32:08.512
God, I met a girl last night
and to exit it as well.

481
00:32:08.554 --> 00:32:12.307
No, no, no gate, and a. Your mother
one presents a very strange way.

482
00:32:13.016 --> 00:32:15.435
Truth is not an option now.

483
00:32:15.477 --> 00:32:17.980
I thought you might like
to receive a role.

484
00:32:18.021 --> 00:32:22.568
- If it's a role, should you pay us.
- Yes. You should be getting paid in experience.

485
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:25.445

00:37:30.417 --> 00:37:34.046

Thanks. It is my pleasure
to be here to help you.

585

The first rule to improvizaюii
accepюi is always to the information.

586
00:38:05.577 --> 00:38:08.956
If someone says
something, say, do not refuse.

587
00:38:08.956 --> 00:38:10.749
I understood, that sounds
Well, it's wise.

588
00:38:10.749 --> 00:38:13.168
In my classes in acting,
when someone says "No" during the scene,

589
00:38:13.168 --> 00:38:14.670
rest of the class shouting "Die!".

590
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:18.006
There... then do not say no to "No".
Do not scream "Die!".

591
00:38:18.006 --> 00:38:19.424
Who wants to make someone
Heating exercise?

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.318
What the hell is this?

599
00:39:19.318 --> 00:39:24.281
This smells like feet in children
and soiled linen.

600
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:26.116
Have a happy father's day.

00:42:38.517 --> 00:42:40.769

00:42:43.063 --> 00:42:45.983
Well, I am going to bring station and erveюelele,
because I know that she does not bring them,

659
00:42:45.983 --> 00:42:47.651
because they do not like to
get up and do something.

660
00:42:47.651 --> 00:42:48.652
How nice.

661
00:42:48.652 --> 00:42:50.237
Everyone remain calm.

662
00:42:51.947 --> 00:42:56.368
So Bar, your dad told me
that you like to go to the bathroom.

663
00:42:57.286 --> 00:42:59.288
When I cut, I let go.

664
00:43:00.664 --> 00:43:03.167
- How is he?
- I do not know.

665
00:43:05.377 --> 00:43:08.130
This one is our Bar.
He is a man of a piece.

666
00:43:11.133 --> 00:43:12.259
Maybe I'm a little upset.

667
00:43:13.719 --> 00:43:15.220
You're mad because me and
meet your father?

668
00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.932
No, you seem to make him daddy
happy and that's good.

669
00:43:18.932 --> 00:43:21.560
- But...
- What?

670
00:43:22.936 --> 00:43:23.979
Nothing.

671
00:43:23.979 --> 00:43:26.690
I do not want you feel uncomfortable,
can you tell me anything.

672
00:43:27.399 --> 00:43:30.235
I do not like that and broke
I promise you made to me.

00:43:30.235 --> 00:43:32.488
- What promise?
- Yes, and even to that promise?

674
00:43:33.238 --> 00:43:37.159
Last year I promised to
take me to Hawaii to swim with dolphins.

675
00:43:37.159 --> 00:43:40.996
They have a lagoon where dolphins
and people can swim with them.

676
00:43:40.996 --> 00:43:41.997
What are you doing?

677
00:43:41.997 --> 00:43:44.917
But without warning me,
My father canceled vacations.

678
00:43:44.917 --> 00:43:48.378
- Why would they do that?
- He met you.

679
00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.882
- What did he do?
- No!

680
00:43:51.882 --> 00:43:54.801
- Die!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

681
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:58.430
I want to say no...
You have understood well what I said.

682
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:01.642
I said that we should
go to Hawaii earlier.

683
00:44:01.642 --> 00:44:04.895
Because of all we'd like
to spend some time together there.

684
00:44:04.895 --> 00:44:06.480
We will go to Hawaii.

685
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.034
I can not believe I left a
6 years your kid to me and blackmail.

686
00:44:19.034 --> 00:44:21.370
I saw that I had a chance
and we took advantage of it.

687
00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.414
You're angry with yourself, for
that we've put ourselves in the matter.

688
00:44:24.414 --> 00:44:25.874
- Yes, I have not stuck.
- Yes.

689
00:44:25.874 --> 00:44:27.543
I believe the Lord and time
"Mary Poppins" said

690
00:44:27.543 --> 00:44:30.629
You can not deny, can not
refuse, Governor.

691
00:44:30.629 --> 00:44:34.383
Well, listen to me, my tolerance
for these insults is up here.

692
00:44:34.383 --> 00:44:38.762
When you get here, take my children
Forget thee, and I'm going home.

693
00:44:38.762 --> 00:44:42.516
I'm so glad
that do this, Danny.

694
00:44:42.516 --> 00:44:45.435

696
00:44:47.604 --> 00:44:51.441
<i>You bought Seventeen magazine
for them or for you?</i>

697
00:44:51.441 --> 00:44:52.734
It is for me.
It's my favorite.

698
00:44:52.734 --> 00:44:54.278
Did you hear that?
Have you ever read and review it?

699
00:44:54.278 --> 00:44:55.946
It's obvious that you have not read it.

700
00:44:55.946 --> 00:44:59.158

Good and Thiele, dear.

00:45:10.627 --> 00:45:13.046
I could not help me
take thought of you.

705
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.594
He is? I have it in my face
the most generous man.

706
00:45:18.594 --> 00:45:21.138
- Okay, I'm confused now.

707
00:45:21.138 --> 00:45:25.517

00:45:27.186 --> 00:45:30.606
- Devlin's boyfriend, her monkey love.
- Kill me now.

709
00:45:30.731 --> 00:45:32.524
Devlin said that the
I had to stay at work.

710
00:45:32.524 --> 00:45:34.443
That said?

711
00:45:34.443 --> 00:45:36.612
Not really.
You should not stay at work.

712
00:45:36.612 --> 00:45:40.240
- I will work when I want.
- That's so cool.

713
00:45:40.324 --> 00:45:42.493
Cause you're all the atвюi
legaюi among yourselves. You know, I would have liked

Yes, I am glad.

717
00:45:49.625 --> 00:45:53.295
It is important that children
see us united.

718
00:45:53.295 --> 00:45:55.672
Also, I can not stand

<i>Danny is a great plastic surgeon.</i>

784
00:49:27.384 --> 00:49:29.720
<i>Who has not had time

00:49:30.179 --> 00:49:33.557
<i>And everything is played with his friends,
belonging to the navy.</i>

786
00:49:33.557 --> 00:49:35.017
Piano Man?
For the Piano Man?

<i>And Eddie ordinary rod to be just as red.</i>

00:49:41.523 --> 00:49:43.734
<i>And to have freckles on his face.</i>

<i>But still domniюele
He throws the corn.</i>

Sorry.
Do not understand what you mean.

797
00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:17.976
I am a shepherd of sheep.

798
00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:22.189
You know, people do not buy
sheep from the locals.

799
00:50:22.189 --> 00:50:24.817
- Do you? Stop buying?
- No, not buy.

- And what people do with these sheep?
- Anything they want.

809

- He gave us each a Heineken.

1128
01:09:13.403 --> 01:09:15.864
- I got one and that is why.
- No, stay at the Dolphin.

1129
01:09:15.864 --> 01:09:18.200
I miss you оюi are less
thrown in the head.

1130
01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:22.704
- God, that was sick man.
- Yes, yes, yes. Ready?

1131
01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:25.332
Do not think about fear, acюioneazг. Go!

1132
01:09:31.505 --> 01:09:33.090
Well done, mate.

1133
01:09:36.468 --> 01:09:39.763
It was amazing, dude. Eat junkie dunking pound cake.
But do not stop there.

1134
01:09:40.389 --> 01:09:44.685
- Devlin? Devlin?
- Yes?

1135
01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:49.148
Danny's birthday is next week
and I do not know what to take.

1136
01:09:51.692 --> 01:09:55.863
Do not buy the tie.
It has a hundred and never wear them not.

1137
01:09:55.863 --> 01:09:57.114
It's over knew.

1138
01:09:57.156 --> 01:09:59.241
She loves audio books
as you listen in the car.

1139
01:09:59.449 --> 01:10:01.493
Loves fishing gear.

1140
01:10:01.493 --> 01:10:05.664
But to use? I do not know how to remove
on telecommunications and the hook that caught him once.

1141
01:10:05.664 --> 01:10:06.665
Only colecюioneazг it.

1142
01:10:07.374 --> 01:10:10.502
I like sweets. I love jellies.
His favorites.

1143
01:10:10.502 --> 01:10:12.880
But not like vata than the bath
and peanut butter,

1144
01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.717
So the need to buy and jellies
and to separate these elements

1145
01:10:16.717 --> 01:10:19.386
and then put them into a mesh
That's why the little zipper and i. ..

1146
01:10:19.428 --> 01:10:21.680
You know so much about him.

1147
01:10:22.723 --> 01:10:26.894
Yes... You know the one forever.

1148
01:10:28.562 --> 01:10:30.481
Music. Loves music.

1149
01:10:30.939 --> 01:10:34.610
But every year after '95,
a waste of resources.

1150
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:37.029
When I finished
My research and work i.

1151
01:10:38.989 --> 01:10:42.826
- How many cakes we have left?
- Around 40.

1152
01:10:42.993 --> 01:10:45.329
How about 40 meters
for 40 cakes?

1153
01:10:45.329 --> 01:10:47.247
You're doing? Or you need
The little rest?

1154
01:10:47.623 --> 01:10:51.585
- Let's do it.
- Really? Okay, ready!

1155
01:10:51.585 --> 01:10:54.463
- Almost ready.
- What? No.

1156
01:10:54.463 --> 01:11:00.219
Ladies and gentlemen, comes the wave.
It becomes serious!

1157
01:11:00.219 --> 01:11:02.554
- Are you sure, Michael?
- I dare say.

1158
01:11:02.554 --> 01:11:05.766
All right. Whatever it is,
You're a good boy.

1159
01:11:06.099 --> 01:11:08.352

1162
01:11:17.861 --> 01:11:20.531
God! Lord!

1163
01:11:29.873 --> 01:11:32.251
- Come on. One more bit.
- You can do it!

1164
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:34.253
Do not give up.

1165
01:11:41.134 --> 01:11:43.095
Very nice! This one is my boy.

1166
01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:48.350
- Bravo, mate!
- We did it! Thanks.

1167
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:52.271
It was only your merit, buddy.
It was incredible. Very good!

1168
01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:03.615
- What should I see?
- Jesus Christ!

1169
01:12:03.615 --> 01:12:09.163
Devlin? Lord. You steal, and at

1170
01:12:09.163 --> 01:12:13.750
Really? Agiюi you soon?
The so happens at menopause.

1171
01:12:14.626 --> 01:12:16.044
Devlin?

1172
01:12:16.044 --> 01:12:20.549

01:12:20.549 --> 01:12:22.426
Enters each other!

1174
01:12:24.261 --> 01:12:29.725

1175
01:12:29.725 --> 01:12:32.728
- Whose girlfriend?

I am married and very flattered.
Thanks. Where's Danny?

1178
01:12:38.984 --> 01:12:42.613
Danny is in water, it learns
the little guy to swim.

1179
01:12:42.613 --> 01:12:45.616
- Hello, Doctor.
- Yes, it was a nice standby.

1180
01:12:45.616 --> 01:12:49.495
You know what has and has weird? I have never met
anyone with the name of Devlin.

1181

Yes! Fight in water,
and I now benefit.

01:13:01.173 --> 01:13:05.052
Try to beat me,
but no chances. Nobody has.

1184
01:13:05.469 --> 01:13:06.845
What fun e.

1185
01:13:06.845 --> 01:13:09.056
It opened a window

At 19:00.

1188
01:13:13.852 --> 01:13:17.731
- No, no...
- It's like a shark.

1189
01:13:18.273 --> 01:13:21.985
- It's an evening inappropriate? Did you quarrel?
- Do we fight? No.

1190
01:13:23.987 --> 01:13:26.657
We're fine.
Tonight is perfect.

1191
01:13:26.865 --> 01:13:29.201
Perfect.

1192
01:13:29.284 --> 01:13:32.246
Well. Lord!
Let it breathe!

1193
01:13:32.496 --> 01:13:33.330
Yes, I...

1194
01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:40.921
What? I...
You were under...

1195
01:13:43.006 --> 01:13:47.845
- Do not understand, why did you agree?
- Because I knew I will not say no.

1196
01:13:47.886 --> 01:13:50.430
Do not leave here. What I said Palmer?

1197
01:13:58.147 --> 01:13:59.273
What, sweetie?

1198
01:14:00.023 --> 01:14:04.653
Today, when I did wind
Dolph pool was weird, huh?

1199
01:14:05.571 --> 01:14:08.365
No, it's a way to search.
That's what people like him.

1200
01:14:08.907 --> 01:14:14.163
They played harder and I think it's time
Your iniюierii. You came into play, I think.

1201
01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:16.540
Well...
Yes...

1202
01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:22.588
For tonight, I thought...
Can we make time for me?

1203
01:14:26.842 --> 01:14:28.844
I take the rubber and rгюu
and see you in a second.

1204
01:14:30.262 --> 01:14:32.514
Hello, yes... Do not attend tonight.

1205
01:14:32.639 --> 01:14:34.475
It's my first night alone with girl...

1206
01:14:34.892 --> 01:14:38.228
Оюi ask a single favor.
Come with me only at this dinner,

01:14:43.275 --> 01:14:45.611
- And what's gonna tell him Palmer?
- Give me a phone.

1209
01:14:50.407 --> 01:14:51.283
Lord...

1210
01:14:51.867 --> 01:14:55.954
- Tell me you do not listen to 'N Sync.
- No, he hears the elevator.

1211
01:14:57.372 --> 01:14:59.833
Danny is my song.

1212
01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:01.752
Is anyone on the phone for you.

1213
01:15:02.211 --> 01:15:03.921
<i>- I do not know...

1214
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:05.589
<i>Hello?</i>

1215
01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.050
- What is it?

1216
01:15:08.675 --> 01:15:11.512
I want to pick up the phone, so inviюi
in the city, it can go as far

1217
01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.639
hotel all night.
You want to do that, please?

1218
01:15:13.764 --> 01:15:15.474
No, I already eat, I want to exit it.

1219
01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:18.060
- Seriously, I need you.
- Do not...

1220
01:15:19.144 --> 01:15:20.103
- Lord...
- Get it!

1221
01:15:20.145 --> 01:15:21.021
Well.

1222
01:15:22.564 --> 01:15:23.607
Talk to him by Dolph.

1223
01:15:24.691 --> 01:15:25.567
E Dolph.

1224
01:15:27.152 --> 01:15:31.990
What about us two to go
and have dinner, tonight?

1225
01:15:33.158 --> 01:15:33.992
Tonight?

1226
01:15:34.076 --> 01:15:35.994
Yes, let us know each other better,

1227
01:15:36.203 --> 01:15:39.665
for it is important for children
to have a good mismatch

1228
01:15:39.665 --> 01:15:40.582
and family unit.

1229
01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:43.210
Yes... Wait to talk to Danny.

1230
01:15:44.086 --> 01:15:48.799
- Dolph wants to have dinner tonight.
- Do not... Well, tell him yes.

1231
01:15:51.009 --> 01:15:52.302
Yeah, right.

1232
01:15:54.054 --> 01:15:55.514
Оюi thank you very much.

1233
01:15:55.514 --> 01:15:57.057
What will you tell him all night?

1234
01:15:57.307 --> 01:16:01.979
Bгlmгje're all kind of nonsense
hours of your language...

1235
01:16:02.396 --> 01:16:05.274
Do it, just do it
far from the hotel.

1236
01:16:05.524 --> 01:16:08.944
Okay, I'll do, but if they do well,
I can sleep in bed with you?

1237
01:16:10.237 --> 01:16:12.906
No, why, you have a wonderful private room.

1238
01:16:25.836 --> 01:16:28.005
Seriously, because when
I was in Napa Valley

1239
01:16:28.172 --> 01:16:30.632
said that there was a period
good year for Merlot.

1240
01:16:31.258 --> 01:16:34.136
What you verite about a Cabernet?

1241
01:16:34.636 --> 01:16:35.971
Cabernet does not taste like grapes?

1242
01:16:36.472 --> 01:16:38.474
I mean, I like the taste of
grapes, but not too much.

1243
01:16:38.515 --> 01:16:42.436
- Have you looked on the menu?
- I took a look, yes...

1244
01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:43.770
Have a look?

1245
01:16:43.979 --> 01:16:47.816
I graduated without medicine
read a book. Stay calm and very nice, calm...

1246
01:16:48.066 --> 01:16:49.985
Bring us the most expensive
a glass of wine that you

1247
01:16:50.277 --> 01:16:52.738
and I think that will be enough.
- Perfect.

1248
01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:57.159
Look at us, Katherine
the marriage and both have a happy.

1249
01:16:57.826 --> 01:16:58.911
Can you believe?

1250
01:17:00.078 --> 01:17:03.248
- All I ever wanted, my Yogi...
- Bubu...

1251
01:17:03.582 --> 01:17:05.292
- Yogi mine...
- Bubu...

1252
01:17:07.586 --> 01:17:08.712
Never enough.

1253
01:17:12.257 --> 01:17:14.468
<i>I think they took one of
Your yellow bombs.</i>

1254
01:17:19.723 --> 01:17:21.141
<i>I just hope that their noses clean.</i>

1255
01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:24.520
Wait a minute.

1256
01:17:25.437 --> 01:17:30.192
I love your smell.
Nothing smells as good as Devlin.

1257
01:17:30.526 --> 01:17:33.195
Devlin mirositoarea.
Always welcome.

1258
01:17:39.618 --> 01:17:41.036
Even eat here?

1259
01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:45.457
Yes, say those at the hotel
it's amazing. It's good.

1260
01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:49.837
I want that machine.
Laying two Оюi give her.

1261
01:17:50.462 --> 01:17:53.215
Two chicken?
Very nice of you.

1262
01:17:53.757 --> 01:17:57.177
We are just here for dinner.
And the machine is worth about ten thousand chickens.

1263
01:17:58.178 --> 01:18:01.014
Do not pour over me.

1264
01:18:02.432 --> 01:18:03.892
Do you me the cup.

1265
01:18:04.852 --> 01:18:07.187
So Danny, you're a plastic surgeon.

1266
01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:08.355
Yes.

1267
01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:12.109
- Very convenient for you, Katherine.
- Girl and has not done anything.

1268
01:18:12.484 --> 01:18:13.652
It's just a natural beauty.

1269
01:18:13.694 --> 01:18:14.945
- Honey...
- Even e.

1270
01:18:15.112 --> 01:18:17.114
And I, what did you do that I arrange?

1271
01:18:18.031 --> 01:18:21.201
From a professional perspective?
Nothing, and would you get to do anything.

1272
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:24.288
Nothing?
You're too sweet!

1273
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:27.958
I mean, you already would you get out too much fat
the arm, but that there sleeves.

1274
01:18:29.251 --> 01:18:30.711
So, where did you meet?

1275
01:18:32.504 --> 01:18:35.090
We met at a concert.

1276
01:18:35.382 --> 01:18:38.385
Sting. At The Index Card.

1277
01:18:38.969 --> 01:18:41.513
The funds gathered
saving the rain forest.

1278
01:18:43.974 --> 01:18:46.852
You look for someone on the phone.
I think the guy in "The Omen".

1279
01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:50.606
Tell the man I?

1280
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:53.233
Wait a second.

1281
01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.986
Can I say something before you speak?

1282
01:18:56.695 --> 01:18:59.948
Let him see the man who invented
Talking on the iPod iPhone

1283
01:19:00.157 --> 01:19:03.827
answering, "Tell the man I"
It was just like seeing it

1284
01:19:03.994 --> 01:19:06.163
Ronald McDonald eating a
cheeseburger on the counter.

1285
01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:08.624
- Sorry...
- Very true...

1286
01:19:09.124 --> 01:19:12.794
For me it was like
I saw a doctor and taking life.

1287
01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:17.466
Excuse me, is one of the foundations
my need to talk.

1288
01:19:19.051 --> 01:19:21.428
Food and intelligence you Thi, passion...

1289
01:19:21.762 --> 01:19:26.016
Beauty, femininity and you need...

1290
01:19:32.439 --> 01:19:34.316
We do this as many times
one of us leaves.

1291
01:19:34.399 --> 01:19:37.152
We say what we like best
more to each other.

1292
01:19:37.694 --> 01:19:39.196
How nice!

1293
01:19:39.321 --> 01:19:40.489

I'll do now.
Right now.

1298
01:19:48.914 --> 01:19:49.790
Well.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:54.545
So, without a fanю and I exit it
the streets to sell my business.

1300
01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:56.964
And by that I mean my body.

01:19:57.589 --> 01:20:00.008
And I mean crenvu through the body and my kid.

1302
01:20:01.635 --> 01:20:03.554
Help! Is there a vet on here?

1303
01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:07.432
My Sheep Company and their supporters!
Do not breathe! I do not know what is!

Well.

1310
01:20:31.582 --> 01:20:32.708
Hello...

1311
01:20:36.962 --> 01:20:40.174

Resume the game?

1332
01:22:26.613 --> 01:22:31.577
Let me start by saying
I like that most

1333
01:22:31.952 --> 01:22:36.790
Thi-teeth that you set.
They were terrible.

1334
01:22:41.712 --> 01:22:42.713
You know what I hate?

1335
01:22:43.589 --> 01:22:45.966
The way you do everything for others

1336
01:22:46.216 --> 01:22:47.843
and tepюi and not anything back.

1337
01:22:48.051 --> 01:22:51.680
In fact, they tell you thanks,

I trust you more than the

1343
01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:20.000
I like your smile.
It's magic.

1344
01:23:21.001 --> 01:23:24.880
When the operations room,
I think that more than 20 minutes

1345
01:23:25.047 --> 01:23:26.840

1346
01:23:28.091 --> 01:23:32.387
With this smile I start the day.

1347
01:23:40.562 --> 01:23:41.730

Some people feel better edge

Do not feel pressured.

1382
01:25:40.682 --> 01:25:42.226
I must not feel pressured.

1383
01:25:45.979 --> 01:25:48.106

But I finished.

1412

How to decide?

01:29:28.202 --> 01:29:30.078
without help of hands.

1426

01:31:18.228 --> 01:31:19.771
You're not any good!

1465
01:31:21.273 --> 01:31:22.107
Bubu...

1466
01:31:23.192 --> 01:31:25.611
Great teamwork.

1468
01:31:27.696 --> 01:31:28.530
- Ten years.
- Eight...

1469
01:31:29.198 --> 01:31:30.657

1470
01:31:31.158 --> 01:31:33.327

- Yes ..

1471
01:31:33.494 --> 01:31:35.412
- You understand how happy I did that?
- Yes, I know...

1472
01:31:36.163 --> 01:31:39.500
What face you have when juggling mime...
It was the most important moment.

1473
01:31:39.583 --> 01:31:43.212
It was wonderful.
And when you spoke of her arms...

1474
01:31:44.004 --> 01:31:48.217
The good news is that it beats
sorry for all the guy's iPod.

1475
01:31:48.258 --> 01:31:49.134
I know...

1476
01:31:50.928 --> 01:31:52.513
It was good.
It was very fun.

1477
01:31:52.721 --> 01:31:56.517
I think that was the first time

1478
01:31:56.683 --> 01:32:01.146
when I exit it but us.

1479
01:32:01.396 --> 01:32:04.525
I know, and I feel guilty about that.

1480
01:32:05.484 --> 01:32:06.360
Even I feel.

1481
01:32:06.485 --> 01:32:09.655
You exit it with a real man, and when
I say this I mean one which is washed.

1482
01:32:12.574 --> 01:32:17.663
I find it adorable how
You're obsessed with this guy.

1483
01:32:17.955 --> 01:32:19.373
I can not you imagine me on a date.

1484
01:32:20.082 --> 01:32:21.041
Who said that a date?

1485
01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:21.917
Ever?

1486
01:32:22.376 --> 01:32:23.210
- You!
- You!

1487
01:32:23.544 --> 01:32:25.462
You become very agitated when
you talking to this guy...

1488
01:32:25.546 --> 01:32:30.217
Listen. I and Dr Gervitz
Cabinet moves to New York.

1489
01:32:30.634 --> 01:32:32.386
Ryan will not go with him

1490
01:32:32.886 --> 01:32:35.430
and asked me

1491
01:32:35.639 --> 01:32:40.227
if you want to take his place.

1492
01:32:40.978 --> 01:32:41.854
Are you going?

1493
01:32:43.147 --> 01:32:44.106
No.

1494
01:32:44.982 --> 01:32:48.152
- I can do that.
- I wanted to see how react.

1495
01:32:48.235 --> 01:32:50.612
Look at you.
You can not live without me!

1496
01:32:50.946 --> 01:32:53.073
Where do I sign, what to do with it...

1497
01:32:53.866 --> 01:32:58.203
You played a little with me.
You could tell me.

1498
01:32:59.413 --> 01:33:05.335
- I wanted to do a little jealous, right?
- No, I'm just having fun to you.

1499
01:33:05.752 --> 01:33:08.046
It was fun.
Why were you jealous?

1500
01:33:09.214 --> 01:33:11.675
No, nonsense...
How to be jealous?

1501
01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:17.055
Look at you... what's with that smile?
No I did not know that you atвюia teeth.

1502
01:33:22.269 --> 01:33:28.150
So, there's nothing between you and i. ..
He has no luck.

1503
01:33:30.944 --> 01:33:33.572
- When big sin.
- What?

1504
01:33:34.781 --> 01:33:37.826
That we were put in the way that nut
Coconut tonight. It's a shame, huh?

1505
01:33:39.077 --> 01:33:42.831
- It's bad...
- You were lucky it was there that nut.

1506
01:33:42.915 --> 01:33:45.083
You could not cope.

1507
01:33:46.251 --> 01:33:47.044
Maybe you're right.

1508
01:33:50.297 --> 01:33:52.925
Do you have something up your sleeve,
that I do not know?

1509
01:33:53.842 --> 01:33:55.010
I do not know.

1510
01:33:55.761 --> 01:33:58.055
- Okay.
- I do not know, I have to think.

1511
01:33:59.389 --> 01:34:00.307
Mommy!

1512
01:34:02.142 --> 01:34:05.270
Hey, kids.
What are you doing?

1513
01:34:05.979 --> 01:34:07.105

Awesome.

1515
01:34:09.066 --> 01:34:11.235
No big deal, right?

1516
01:34:12.736 --> 01:34:13.821
Lord...

1517
01:34:14.029 --> 01:34:14.947
Yes, it's asleep.

1518
01:34:14.988 --> 01:34:15.823
Look and you...

1519
01:34:21.036 --> 01:34:22.579

- Nice to see you, kids.

1521
01:34:27.209 --> 01:34:28.335
Another day, kids.

1522
01:34:28.752 --> 01:34:31.046
- Almost done.
- Okay.

1523
01:34:31.505 --> 01:34:33.048
So you must go to bed...

1528
01:34:42.766 --> 01:34:44.685
- Okay.

1529
01:34:45.269 --> 01:34:47.521
Good luck, we hear the morning.

1530
01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.795
Do not go to bed...

1531
01:35:23.015 --> 01:35:25.267
- Hello. Danny!

1532
01:35:26.059 --> 01:35:28.187

1533

What? I went...

1534
01:35:30.439 --> 01:35:34.568
I went... eraюi where you
I came after you. What happened?

1535
01:35:34.651 --> 01:35:35.486
How was dinner?

1536
01:35:36.695 --> 01:35:39.781
He made breathing
mouth to mouth of a sheep.

1537
01:35:40.491 --> 01:35:41.617
And I drank a few glasses.

1538
01:35:42.451 --> 01:35:45.787
Drowning, he and I So I
mouth breathing did the bot...

1539
01:35:47.372 --> 01:35:50.459
It was the black sheep of the family,

1540
01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:54.421
but it was, and white.
It makes sense that?

1541
01:35:55.631 --> 01:35:59.843
And talking about how great it was
this trip and how great is you.

1542
01:35:59.968 --> 01:36:02.387
Yes. I'm kidding...

1543
01:36:03.514 --> 01:36:06.558
And I said that if children and me
I did not keep busy as much,

1544
01:36:06.767 --> 01:36:10.312

do something you wanted to do...

1545
01:36:10.854 --> 01:36:11.897

1549
01:36:22.908 --> 01:36:26.620
Why not? We are in Hawaii.
Let's do it tomorrow.

1550
01:36:27.204 --> 01:36:29.706
It was something special from
moment we met.

1551
01:36:30.123 --> 01:36:31.834
And I saw how you wear with children

1552
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.753

01:36:55.774 --> 01:36:58.443
Yes.
Come, go, go!

1560
01:36:58.610 --> 01:37:00.737
- Do not wait, can not go.

01:37:21.091 --> 01:37:24.678
Thanks, Devlin,
I hope to come tomorrow.

1567
01:37:25.304 --> 01:37:30.601
I can not. It's very... bad luck
if one was coming to the wedding.

1568
01:37:31.393 --> 01:37:34.563
- Come, Dolph, to go.
- But they are still here.

1569
01:37:34.605 --> 01:37:37.774

Hello.
Yes, I'm glad you called.

1574
01:39:47.863 --> 01:39:48.697

Yes, check schedule

for your parents and I...
- I know, you should not do that.

1577
01:40:01.084 --> 01:40:04.838
Her parents and she would not come
wants to be a little secret.

1578
01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:06.507
In hiding?

1579
01:40:07.925 --> 01:40:08.759
I understand.

1580
01:40:08.967 --> 01:40:12.429
Well. Have you decided which one to wear tomorrow?

1581
01:40:13.972 --> 01:40:16.308
You think that's a good idea?

1582
01:40:17.017 --> 01:40:18.936
What? Wedding?

1583
01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:23.232
Yes, the wedding.
All... Palmer thing.

1584
01:40:26.443 --> 01:40:31.031
- That's why I came here, right?
- I think yes.

1585
01:40:32.866 --> 01:40:34.076
Do not you think it's crazy?

1586
01:40:39.331 --> 01:40:42.751
Danny, you do not need my permission.

1587
01:40:44.294 --> 01:40:45.504
You're a big boy.

1588
01:40:46.213 --> 01:40:47.214
I know...

1589
01:40:50.968 --> 01:40:53.512
Only that if I do that,

1590
01:40:55.139 --> 01:41:00.352
situation of us
become strange to the office.

1591
01:41:01.770 --> 01:41:03.564
You should not worry about that.

1592
01:41:06.775 --> 01:41:07.943
You go to New York?

1593
01:41:08.819 --> 01:41:13.073
Yes. As much as I wanted

1594
01:41:13.198 --> 01:41:17.578
to my face you're rebuilding,

1595
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:22.958
I feel I must take it from the beginning.

1596
01:41:25.836 --> 01:41:26.795
<i>Hello, May you're there?</i>

1597
01:41:28.464 --> 01:41:29.465
You understand?

1598
01:41:31.175 --> 01:41:32.259
I think so...

1599
01:41:34.261 --> 01:41:36.430
Many beliefs have heard
by this phone.

1600
01:41:38.765 --> 01:41:42.269
I am divorced, have two children,
I have no time for assumptions.

1601
01:41:47.524 --> 01:41:51.528
Have a great day tomorrow, Doctor,
why not a little sleep?

1602
01:42:06.418 --> 01:42:08.712
So that's it, no
have anything to worry about.

1603
01:42:08.796 --> 01:42:13.383
We have flowers, music and location,
that's great, I'm gonna like it.

1604
01:42:13.759 --> 01:42:18.722
I promise that will be the
wonderful day of your life. Guaranteed.

1605
01:42:18.764 --> 01:42:22.351
- Devlin!
- Palmer, I do not...

1606
01:42:25.813 --> 01:42:30.192
You look... absolutely beautiful.

1607
01:42:31.193 --> 01:42:34.446
Thanks.
Devlin, can I ask you something?

1608
01:42:34.863 --> 01:42:35.739
Of course.

1609
01:42:37.282 --> 01:42:38.826
Still ferent from Danny?

1610
01:42:40.327 --> 01:42:42.412
Wait, what?
Why...

1611
01:42:42.496 --> 01:42:48.418
Because I believe that he could
are still in love with you.

1612
01:42:50.129 --> 01:42:54.925
Really?
Why do you believe that?

1613
01:42:55.968 --> 01:42:58.512
And you always shine
when you're around

1614
01:42:58.971 --> 01:43:01.974
and laugh at your jokes.
In my not laughing.

1615
01:43:02.432 --> 01:43:06.562
Palmer, believe me,
there's nothing between me and Danny.

1616
01:43:07.146 --> 01:43:10.482
We just... familiar.

1617
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:16.238
You're right girl for him.
He said that just last night.

1618
01:43:16.947 --> 01:43:19.783
Lord Devlin, the big door greeting.

1619
01:43:20.492 --> 01:43:23.537
Because he had no chance and
if the standby compete against you.

1620
01:43:40.053 --> 01:43:43.015
- I Excuse... Poftiюi.
- Thanks.

1621
01:43:43.432 --> 01:43:46.143

So where's Danny?

1626

Devlin, Danny is at his wedding.

1627
01:44:05.746 --> 01:44:06.580
Can you repeюi?

1628
01:44:07.372 --> 01:44:08.415
I was never married to him.

1629
01:44:09.792 --> 01:44:11.752
It was a big lie,
I invented it.

1630
01:44:12.252 --> 01:44:13.128
Why?

1631
01:44:15.130 --> 01:44:18.300
I supported the idea
you to know the truth.

1632
01:44:19.009 --> 01:44:19.802
Just right?

1633
01:44:20.385 --> 01:44:22.721
It and So, yes, I'm a single mother

1634
01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:26.433
I have two children who love them
more than anything in the world,

1635
01:44:26.725 --> 01:44:29.853
driving a Honda, still
I Internet via modem,

1636
01:44:31.230 --> 01:44:34.775
I had an average of 2.7
in college, not 3.4.

1637
01:44:35.526 --> 01:44:36.777
And if all confess the whole truth

1638
01:44:37.611 --> 01:44:39.154
I called my children "rгhгюel" after you.

1639
01:44:40.906 --> 01:44:44.451
And working for Danny.
I'm his assistant. That's it.

1640
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:47.955
Seriously, me and not be
never thought about it.

1641
01:44:48.497 --> 01:44:50.332
Between the two of you was a true connection.

1642
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:52.793
It's great.

1643
01:44:53.043 --> 01:44:54.461
It's the greatest man.

1644
01:44:57.089 --> 01:44:58.549
And I would be able to
be in love with him,

1645
01:45:00.968 --> 01:45:02.594
but that does not really matter now,

1646
01:45:02.970 --> 01:45:05.848
and because he marry you
with another person.

1647
01:45:06.431 --> 01:45:07.349
In this moment.

1648
01:45:09.518 --> 01:45:10.936
I'm breaking up in January.

1649
01:45:12.146 --> 01:45:14.481
What?
What happened?

1650
01:45:16.775 --> 01:45:19.820
- From the beginning, is gay.
- It's gay?

1651
01:45:19.987 --> 01:45:21.029
Look at him.

1652
01:45:21.989 --> 01:45:24.825
You bite strong chi.
He gathered together.

1653
01:45:25.909 --> 01:45:28.078
Devlin, must tell you that last night,

1654
01:45:28.245 --> 01:45:30.080
when he grabbed the bottom of coconut,

1655
01:45:30.455 --> 01:45:31.832
kindled a small beculeю.

1656
01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:36.044
I saw him doing it with soap.

1657
01:45:42.801 --> 01:45:44.344
What about the iPod?

1658
01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:47.014
- Na invented anything.
- No?

1659
01:45:47.973 --> 01:45:52.311
He made money giving the team costs
Dogers after being hit by a ball.

1660
01:45:53.437 --> 01:45:57.858
God, why...

1661
01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:00.027
Something else.

1662
01:46:00.444 --> 01:46:04.990
Yes, I have not tried to
before we tell the truth?

1663
01:46:05.657 --> 01:46:06.658
I do not know.

1664
01:46:11.747 --> 01:46:12.831
How beautiful it is!

1665
01:46:13.332 --> 01:46:16.960
It's nice to tell the truth.
It was nice. The truth is fun, right?

1666
01:46:17.461 --> 01:46:20.047
Telling the truth when he says that would
able to be in love with me?

1667
01:46:21.256 --> 01:46:22.966
- You coward.
- Okay.

1668
01:46:23.258 --> 01:46:24.927
- I'm going to divorce.
- Cheers.

1669
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:32.810
Where are my children?

1670
01:46:33.352 --> 01:46:35.354
Palmer led them to an ice cream.

1671
01:46:36.772 --> 01:46:38.857
How was the wedding?

1672
01:46:41.652 --> 01:46:46.782
I was on the verge of a great rock,
I began to look to the Pacific

1673
01:46:47.866 --> 01:46:49.243
and I said

1674
01:46:51.078 --> 01:46:56.291
"I would like to start my
life that they love. "

1675
01:46:58.001 --> 01:47:02.422
The only problem was that the one
I loved was not with me.

1676
01:47:04.133 --> 01:47:06.051
- It was not?
- It was not.

1677
01:47:07.219 --> 01:47:08.971
So there you have...

1678
01:47:09.263 --> 01:47:10.139
I could not.

1679
01:47:11.056 --> 01:47:12.057
You have done it.

1680
01:47:12.891 --> 01:47:17.980
There is something wonderful going on between us?

1681
01:47:19.815 --> 01:47:21.608
Danny

1682
01:47:24.069 --> 01:47:26.613
what will happen when
not to be on vacation

1683
01:47:26.989 --> 01:47:30.367
and you wake up and you
realize that this is true.

1684
01:47:30.492 --> 01:47:33.537
You're really the only thing
that I had in life.

1685
01:47:33.745 --> 01:47:38.917
Danny, what the heck, she's beautiful
and is only 23 years old.

1686
01:47:41.044 --> 01:47:42.421
I'm not, and a.

1687
01:47:43.255 --> 01:47:47.134
It's good, it's very nice, but is
the only problem. Does not compare to you.

1688
01:47:48.051 --> 01:47:49.011
Does not compare to you.

1689
01:47:50.262 --> 01:47:54.433
Two children. I can not
throw a rock.

1690
01:47:55.976 --> 01:47:59.480
I love those kids more than
anything on this earth, Governor.

1691
01:48:00.939 --> 01:48:03.775
I want to stay with them 23 hours a day.

1692
01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:05.944
And the other hour?

1693
01:48:19.291 --> 01:48:20.834
That's what it is.

1694
01:48:21.251 --> 01:48:22.127
I pray...

1695
01:48:26.924 --> 01:48:30.052
Everything was arranged well for everyone.

1696
01:48:30.719 --> 01:48:32.888
The little swim with the dolphins.

1697
01:48:37.017 --> 01:48:38.977
Palmer has seen a player
tennis with her same age,

1698
01:48:39.102 --> 01:48:39.978
the plane to fly back home

1699
01:48:40.145 --> 01:48:42.397
who is a fan and more
fiery's' N Sync.

1700
01:48:44.566 --> 01:48:46.860
And Maggie to attend a
a course of three weeks

1701
01:48:47.027 --> 01:48:48.654
with true Dolph Lundgren.

1702
01:48:50.489 --> 01:48:51.657
And I?

1703
01:48:52.866 --> 01:48:55.035
Finally the port ring true.

1704
01:48:55.953 --> 01:48:57.871
And now, when I would ask women

1705
01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:01.291
I will say I'm married with
a woman who beat me,

1706
01:49:01.792 --> 01:49:05.712
EALA and I'm not in, do not drink,
I ask, do not drink and has a much

1707
01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:08.632
and that I will
spend the rest of my life.

1708
01:49:08.966 --> 01:49:11.760
A woman named Katherine.

1709
01:49:12.052 --> 01:49:15.055
Want to dance with wife
you, Dr. Maccabee?

1710
01:49:15.597 --> 01:49:17.558
Yes, I, Mrs Maccabee.

1711
01:49:28.485 --> 01:49:30.988
You were right, the guy
mop sticks great on bass.

1712
01:49:31.029 --> 01:49:32.406
What I told?

1713
01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:37.578
Again!

1714
01:49:43.959 --> 01:49:47.796
- I got it. E long.
- I shall move.
