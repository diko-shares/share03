1
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,315
We are back!

2
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:42,155
Let's go!

3
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,040
Nuts!

4
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:48,931
Gimme the Black Beauty.

5
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:54,104
Alvin, take it easy up there.
You've got to share the spotlight.

6
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:55,328
You got it, Dave.

7
00:01:58,192 --> 00:02:02,110
- Dave.
- I'm serious, Alvin. This is a charity benefit.

8
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,550
- It's not all about you.
- Sorry,Dave. I can't hear you ...

9
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:07,787
over the thousands of fans
screaming my name.

10
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:11,084
I've got  this.

11
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,000
I need a help, boys.

12
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,378
Alvin, will you please get down from there.

13
00:02:39,545 --> 00:02:41,811
I can't hear you.

14
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:45,135
- Alvin, I'm not kidding.
- What?

15
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:55,961
- Dave, look out!
- Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

16
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:02,778
Oh, Dave. Dave?

17
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:08,059
This should help with the pain.

18
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,444
I wannna talk to my boys.

19
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,786
I just gave you a sedative
that will take effect in about one minute, so...

20
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,313
But, let them in, quickly.

21
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:23,668
- Dave!
- You are alive! - Hey guys!

22
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,074
- It was an accident. I swear.
- Are you OK?

23
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:29,009
- I'm really sorry, Dave.
- I'll be fine.

24
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:31,221
I'm just gonna be stucked here for a while.

25
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:35,880
And until I get out, I made arrangements for
my aunt Jackie to come and stay with you.

26
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,057
Who is Aunt Jackie?

27
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:40,717
The one who sent us those mail package of 
yummy popcorn for Christmas.

28
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:43,839
- Popcorn Jackie.
- You don't have much time Mr Seville.

29
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,549
Listen, I want you guys to go home
and live a normal childhood.

30
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:53,785
I even made arrangement 
for you to go to school.

31
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:56,623
- School?
- Yes, school.

32
00:03:56,624 --> 00:04:00,003
Simon, I'm putting you in charge.

33
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:04,893
- You are?
- I'm counting on you.

34
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:08,076
Dave, wait a minute. 
Why is he in charge?

35
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:11,714
- He's counting on me.
- Dave, please, don't die.

36
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:13,669
He just sleeping.
He had a sedative.

37
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:16,193
Ah, a sedative.

38
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:19,091
Excuse me, I'm here to escort
the Chipmunks home.

39
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,626
We are not leaving Dave.
I'm putting my paw down on this one.

40
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:23,929
You come here.

41
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,577
I got it! I'll fix it! No, made it worse.

42
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:30,762
Please, please go.

43
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:36,653
More stress you put on persistent
the longer will take him to recover.

44
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:40,546
You are too slow, nanny.

45
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:48,775
You'll never hit me! I'm not going anywhere without Daaa...
...aaaydream believer, and a homecoming queen... 

46
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:55,339
I hope for your sake
he stays asleep for the entire flight.

47
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,048
Maybe you should give him another shot.
Just to be sure.

48
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:10,799
Any ideas on how we gonna find aunt Jackie?

49
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:12,961
Follow me.

50
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:16,824
Excuse me. Sorry.

51
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:19,128
Excuse me, got you.

52
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:24,021
- Look, aunt Jackie! Aunt Jackie!
- Popcorn Jackie.

53
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:26,468
- Oh, come on dears.
- Yeah, we got you.

54
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:28,532
- Popcorn!
- Who's sending to Theodore's?

55
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:31,897
Oh, there is a plenty for everyone.
Give a hug first.

56
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,436
Come over here, you old teddy bear.

57
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:37,017
I'm not really much of a hugger.

58
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:40,972
Oh, boys, I want you to meet someone.
This is my grandson Toby. Toby?

59
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,735
Hi, I'm Theodore.

60
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:46,238
- Toby?!
- What, what happened?

61
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:49,580
- The boys!
- Oh, hey! Hey,how are you? I'm Toby. Nice to meet you.

62
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:52,919
Toby is living with me 'til he figures out
what he want to do with his life.

63
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,232
So far that means going beeoo-beeoo-beeoo
with his thumbs the all day.

64
00:05:56,767 --> 00:06:01,585
For the record goin' beeoo-beeoo-beeoo with my thumbs right now
is keeping me in first place, and that's important.

65
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:03,543
- Toby get the bags.
- What bags?

66
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:08,145
- The lighters. Get the luggages.
- Oh, the lug, right. Let me get those...

67
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:12,867
- Toby!
- Get the brake! Get the brake!

68
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,317
I'm fine.Don't worry!

69
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:29,541
I'm so sorry, aunt Jackie. I'm so sorry.
Is she goin' to be ok?

70
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,410
Don't worry about me, I will be home with no time.

71
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,540
I wouldn't be so sure.

72
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:39,148
It was an accident, I swear.

73
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,927
Been there, done that.
Several times.

74
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:44,240
I guess he will be taking care of us now?

75
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:46,822
I'll take frankly foster of five hundred please-outs.

76
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,791
Ain't no problem. I can totally do this.

77
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:53,581
I mean, I took care of my cat... 
until it ran away.

78
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:57,306
Well, 'ran away' is kind of strong wordin',
I think he just wanted his space.

79
00:06:57,307 --> 00:07:00,638
I still see him around neighbourhood.

80
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,156
You know, he like hisses and claws at me.
but I think that's his way of saying we're still tight, you know.

81
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,640
You guys are nothing to worry about, seriously.
'Cause, I'm not gonna be like Dave, you know, Dave is gone.

82
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:12,778
Gone?

83
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,168
Not gone, not gone gone.
He is not dead. He's very much alive.

84
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,318
He completely coming back.
I'm just gonna be in his room, keepin' his bed warm.

85
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,164
I'll be doin'my thing,you'll be doin' your thing.
I mean, you don't need to know that I'm there.

86
00:07:23,215 --> 00:07:27,852
We supposed to know that you there,
that's the whole idea.

87
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:35,134
Yeah, ok absolutely. You know that I'm there,I'm just...
I'm not gonna be like: I know everything, and you do this, and you do that.

88
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:36,508
I mean that.

89
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:40,393
All right, let's do this.

90
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:42,029
Oh, boy!

91
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,329
Theodore, we gonna be just fine.

92
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:58,546
The important thing is...we're all still alive.

93
00:07:57,547 --> 00:08:02,023
Well, maybe my "Get Well" card will 
help Dave to come faster. 

94
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:05,844
It needs just a touch more glitter.

95
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:12,206
That should do it.
Who's hungry?

96
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:15,195
- Uh, uh me, me!
- Let's eat.

97
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:18,091
Nada. Find anything?

98
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:20,773
It's a food ghost town in here. Alvin?

99
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:24,089
Hello, the cheese balls are in the heat house.

100
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:54,647
Bingo. Dinner, she is  aserved.

101
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:58,063
Hey, what are you doing in here?

102
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:00,572
A cheese ball?

103
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,243
Thumb boy, give me a second, real quick.

104
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:09,156
Alvin, I really need to focus, right now
because I'm one knockout away from my heavy weight title.

105
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:11,637
Can we play as well?

106
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:18,016
You know, I don't want to  hurt your feelings, but else
you don't want see anyone get hurt and there gonna be fistsufferean flyin'.

107
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,617
We can play monopoly.

108
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:21,899
We play monopoly with Dave all the time.

109
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,410
That sounds funny.
We should do that sometime right.

110
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:27,245
Now, I got to back and floatin' like
a butterfly and stinging like the bee.

111
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:33,881
Who needs Toby, Theodore, you got us.

112
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:37,838
Yeah, who needs Toby? Boys, right this way.

113
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:58,021
I'm gonna puke.

114
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:02,732
Do you know what Dave would
say if he were here right now?

115
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:06,402
But I think it means to come more from the belly.

116
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:15,453
Get together.
Be cool.

117
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,859
- Helllooooo?
- Boys, it's me.

118
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,267
Dave?

119
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:24,777
Well, I guess since you've answered the phone, 
you haven't burned down the house yet.

120
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:26,918
- Have a little faith, Dave.
- Yes.

121
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,115
Mayday!

122
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:33,394
- What was that?
- Don't stress him out.

123
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:38,798
- Oh, that was... Aunt Jackie.
- Yeah, she's making us a tasty five-course meal.

124
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:41,907
Really? Can I talk to her?

125
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,641
She's practising her pole dancing.

126
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:48,158
Pole dancing?
But, what happened with making dinner. Guys, what's going on?

127
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,679
- Gotta go, Dave.
- Alvin, I'm not kidding!

128
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,375
- Get better!
- Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

129
00:10:53,982 --> 00:10:56,645
Yep, nobody does that better than him.

130
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,521
Toby, Toby wake up.

131
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:36,398
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay. What is it?

132
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,174
- I had a nightmare.
- Oh, the nightmares.I hate the nightmares.

133
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,179
What was it?

134
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,254
I dreamt that we didn't have a family anymore.

135
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:51,411
Theodore, that couldn't happen. 
No, you guys are tight.

136
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:53,934
Nothing could ever separate you.

137
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:58,680
Less like an eagle swooped down from the sky like caw-caaaw!

138
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,817
Which couldn't happen ever.
Why would you think that ever happened, you know...

139
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:09,515
The Eagles are in Philadelphia.

140
00:12:10,293 --> 00:12:12,423
Sweet dreams.

141
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:22,345
- Toby, make it stop.
- What are you doing?

142
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:25,288
There is something wrong with the clock.
It won't shut up.

143
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:27,594
I can't sleep.

144
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:32,024
That's the point.
It's an alarm clock.

145
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:34,510
It helps you wake up early in the morning.

146
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,676
Why anyone wanna wake up early?

147
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,518
For the school, you got to be there by eight.

148
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:42,626
- In the morning?
- Look, I don't like any others early anything more than you do.

149
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:48,606
But we are in this together, Alvin.
Soon you get to school, soon I get to compound and get back to sleep.

150
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:52,853
- You mean you don't stayin' with us in school?
- No, no , no.

151
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,872
I've done my time making very much.

152
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:59,771
- But school is fun, right?
- Fun? Well, i guess Maybe, it's... fun-ish..

153
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:03,157
Hey, it's my cat!

154
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,044
Hey kiddy it's me, remember?

155
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:13,280
I treated you good.

156
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,361
There, here we go.

157
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:39,826
Enjoy your first day in school.
See you around three-ish.

158
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:50,346
We got it. This got to be a walk in the park.

159
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:53,863
I'm frightening.

160
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:58,004
Hi, I'm Theodore.

161
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:01,714
Hi, I'm Theodore.

162
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,730
- Eagle.
- Go eagle!

163
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:21,815
That wasn't very fun-ish.

167
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:26,690
You must be our new students.
I'm Dr Rubin, the principal.

164
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,865
And we are the Chipmunks.

165
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:32,661
Yeah, that will explain the fur and booshy tales.

166
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:35,225
- Follow me, gentlemen.
- Gentlemen?

167
00:14:35,226 --> 00:14:37,691
Oh, us. Right.

168
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:40,142
There was a minute left and
we were down by two ...

169
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:43,594
And I mind couch: I don't care if my leg is broken,
put me in, I can win this...

170
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:46,067
I never get tired of that story.

171
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,346
So I hobbled out barely able to stand...

172
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,634
Did I mention my leg was broken?

173
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,844
- Mrs. Ortega?
- Yes?

174
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,264
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

175
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:59,845
- Well guys, welcome to home room.
- Good to be here, I hope.

176
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,620
So this is a classroom?

177
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,259
I love the smell of zit cream in the morning.
 
178
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:08,949
Hello ladies.

179
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:17,257
Hi, I'm Theodore. Hi, I'm Theodore.

180
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:20,262
Yes, he's Theodore in case you missed it.

181
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:21,949
And I am Simon.

182
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,080
My name Seville, Alvin Seville.

183
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:29,265
Enchantée... mademoiselle.

184
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,571
Somebody's have to knock these guys down to size.

185
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:37,705
That should be pretty easy, really.
They are only eight inches tall.

186
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:07,915
I had 15 cars.
I mean that's like five more cars than anybody really needs.
 
190
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:13,495
I had seven maids.
Courtside seats to the Lakers.

191
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,518
Even my maids had courstside seats to the Lakers.

192
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:20,419
Now, look at me.

193
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:23,115
Look at me.
I lost everything.

194
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:26,593
Except for my dignity,
they can't take that away from me.

195
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:30,908
And it's all because of them.

196
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:35,599
Oh, hey ...crackers.

197
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,690
Now run around, hoping and praying
that I could find other animals that can ...

198
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:42,021
sing or dance.

199
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:45,301
Wait a second, you don't sing, do you?

200
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:50,332
Hey, hey that's my muffin.
Give me my muffin! You dirty rat.

201
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,019
I will get you Chimpmunks.

202
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,354
Girls, we have to get out of here.

203
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:09,112
I can't see.

204
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:12,520
- My nose.
- That's my tail! - Sorry.

205
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,355
- Move your ass.
- Ok. Stop pushing me.

206
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,560
- We made it. - Jets Records!
- Phew!

207
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:29,627
Oh, my gosh. It's him! Ian Hawke!

208
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:31,874
Mr Hawke?

209
00:17:32,524 --> 00:17:35,640
That voice! I can't get it out of my head!

210
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:38,671
Hello, Mr Hawke?

211
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:41,824
That not in my head, that's really happening.

212
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:45,101
- What do you want?
- We want to introduce ourselves.

213
00:17:45,102 --> 00:17:49,349
That's right.
I'm Brittany. And this is my sister Eleanor.

214
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,196
Hello, sir. Such a pleasure to meet you!

215
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:56,338
And I'm their sister Jeanette. 
Although I feel more like an Olivia or sometimes....

216
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,355
Anyway, we are the Chipmunk girls.

218
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:03,128
We will be just so honored to have you to represent us.

218
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:05,037
You made Alvin and the Chipmunk stars.

219
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:06,760
We wanna be stars too, yeah!

220
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:09,524
And hangin' out with the Chipmunks.

221
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:13,874
Ok, now listen before we get all girly and giggly
about this, just tell me one thing ...

222
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:16,912
You can sing, right?

223
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:21,869
Hang on, not here.

224
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,393
Why not we take this meeting upstairs
in my penthouse office?

225
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:30,928
This is so exciting.

226
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:35,563
Oh, my gosh, can you believe it?

227
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:38,671
My first penthouse office!

228
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:44,503
Oh, my... the Hollywood sign!

230
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:46,360
I thought you might like the view!

231
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:49,477
Ladies, tell me little something about yourselves.

232
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:53,137
We grew up in a small town,
population 300 and ...

233
00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:55,827
Really? That's fascinating. Great! 

234
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:58,120
All right, impress me!

235
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:02,103
One, two, three.

236
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:37,209
Girls, girls, girls.

237
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,558
Guess who just became the number one
Chipmunks' band in whole dang world?

238
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,057
Ian Hawke.

239
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,481
So, when can we meet the Chipmunks?

240
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:52,942
That's an excellent question 
and the excellent answer is...

241
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:56,786
I don't really represent Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.

242
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:59,966
- Oh, no. Wha-what happened?
- Oh, classic tale.

243
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,666
Sweet and innocent when I met them,
they had nothing ...and then I work my butt of

244
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,547
to make them rock stars and...

245
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:11,207
They changed.
Turned out to be like bad cheese.

246
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,574
- No.
- That's terrible.

247
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:17,643
I know. I mean, I treated Alvin like my own son, you know.

248
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,641
And he just goes and spits on me.

249
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:25,194
Literally.
He filled his chipmunk's cheeks with saliva
and just had at it.

250
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,279
- Don't even get me started about Simon.
- But not Theodore, right?

251
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,187
It's the cuddly ones you have to watch for.

252
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:36,994
But why we are talkin' about them for, c'mon?
They are over, fired, nobledeute (noble death)...

253
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:39,398
Chipmunks' stupid sayin'.

254
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:42,088
But ...

255
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:47,189
Girl Chipmunks' stupid sayin' ...
Fasten your seat belts!

256
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:54,151
So I eyed Jay Z's eyes right, and I said: 
Jay, where is Beyonce?

257
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,748
And he says : She's holding a plate 
full of cheese balls, turn around ...

258
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:58,722
And guess what..

259
00:20:58,818 --> 00:21:02,628
- She was.
- PS, Dave left me in charge.

260
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,141
We stay up to ten every night.

261
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:08,738
Look what I can do.

262
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:12,283
You're Theadorable.

263
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:19,366
- I am so sorry.
- That's cool. No harm done.

264
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:23,125
Not yet.
Girls, please, private conference.

265
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,171
Thank you.

266
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:32,520
Listen up, rock stars.

268
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:35,387
If you talk to those girls again
you're dead.

267
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:38,265
If you look at those girls again
you're dead.

268
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:41,876
If you even think about those girls...

269
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:45,318
- Are you thinking about them?
- Well, I am now.

270
00:21:45,536 --> 00:21:48,370
- That's it.
- You are dead!

271
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:52,796
Get them, c'mon! Crack you, you dirty rats!

272
00:21:55,638 --> 00:21:57,910
Scatter!

273
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,005
- That way. Over there!
- I'm runin'.

274
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:06,164
Hey Dumbo, catch me if you can.

275
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:11,852
- You are dead!
- Not!

276
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,609
It's stretching time!

277
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,021
Oh, boy.

278
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:28,960
Eagle.

279
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:31,400
- Eagle! Eagle!
- Get him.

280
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:34,014
- Move! Move!
- This way.

281
00:22:34,982 --> 00:22:36,928
- Gotcha.
- Wait, wait, come up...

282
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:40,170
- It's swirley time.
- C'mon, c'mon guys, this is not so...

283
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:42,719
Please, please!

284
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:48,328
- That's a good look for you!
- Thank you.

285
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:53,333
- I can't swim. Help.
- Grab on Simon!

286
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,299
You okay?

287
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,900
Well, uh, considering that you just saved me 
from drowning in a toilet...

288
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:07,183
I'm, uh, pretty good.

289
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:09,208
I'll be right back.

290
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,612
Alvin, Alvin! 
We're not gonna solve anything with violence!

291
00:23:11,613 --> 00:23:13,630
- It's the fatty ratty.
- Cut it out!

292
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:17,456
- This rat has serious junk in the trunk.
- Yeah, little fatty.

293
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:27,472
Simon, does this make my butt look smaller?

294
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:30,842
Theodore, your butt looks fine.
Those guys are just some jerks.

295
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:44,062
You threatened to climb inside of him
and build a nest.

296
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:48,247
That was out of line and not even sure
that is physically impossible.

297
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:53,736
- I should suspend all three of you.
- Please do.

298
00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:04,133
Instead I have the better idea.

299
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:09,807
Due to budget cutbacks ,
we are in jeopardy of loosing our beloved music program.

300
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:11,608
- That's awful.
- I know.

301
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:14,072
But, there is one small ray of hope.

302
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:17,395
Every year the District sponsors a music competition...

303
00:24:17,396 --> 00:24:20,916
And the winner school receives 25,000 dolars.

304
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,135
If we win, we can save our program.

305
00:24:23,136 --> 00:24:25,733
And you want us to perform?

306
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:28,637
I begin to think that you are a fan?

307
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:32,383
Why don't you sleep on it.

308
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:35,734
- Wait.
- Great.

309
00:24:36,378 --> 00:24:38,808
Promise me that you won't say anything.

310
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:42,299
The principal has a certain image to uphold.
If Mr Fencle ever finds out about this ta...

311
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:49,290
I just can't believe this, that you are actually sitting in my office.
I have all of your CDs.

312
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:52,957
I even went to see you last year in Denver.
That's where I got this.

313
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:56,016
It was my birthday.
And I was like...Oh, the Chipmunks!

314
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:02,830
So, what you say? 
Will you represent our school?

315
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:07,190
Honestly suspension sounds pretty good to me.

316
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:11,462
Come on Alvin?
One for all, and three for one.

317
00:25:11,463 --> 00:25:14,534
Well put, Theodore.Very well put.
Count us in.

318
00:25:14,535 --> 00:25:17,450
Go Eagles!

319
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:20,349
Eagles? Where?

320
00:25:23,408 --> 00:25:25,343
Ah, the penthouse limo.

321
00:25:25,344 --> 00:25:27,569
Très exclusivo.

322
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:34,260
Hey, isn't that that Chihuahua?
Ya know, from the movie?

323
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:39,650
Uh, yeah, yeah. I mean, of course it is.
Yeah, a lot of big names live here.

324
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:42,448
- Oh. Como esta?
- I must have his autograph!

325
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:45,693
Whoa, whoa, Brittany. You wanna be a star, act like a star.

326
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:49,606
- You don't get autographs, you give 'em.
- Oh, right.

327
00:25:51,526 --> 00:25:54,598
Hey, look over there, there's a couple of the Jonas Brothers.

328
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,209
- Where? I don't see them.
- Here we are.

329
00:25:57,698 --> 00:26:02,091
Ok, let's scootin' to my apartment ...

330
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:05,805
What? Did I... Oh, darn it! Darn it to heck!

331
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:08,154
- What? What's wrong?
- Girls, I apologise but ...

332
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:11,458
I seem to left my keys back in my office.

333
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:15,971
What if one of you shroud through that mail
slot and open it up for me from the inside?

334
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:18,319
I'll do it.

335
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:23,109
I'm stuck.

336
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:26,574
All right, I got you, I got you!

337
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,671
Not so hard.

338
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:34,985
I wanna lay off the nuts.

339
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:37,784
All right, how about you, glasses? 
You are in better shape. Wanna go?

340
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:41,313
- Well I'm not that good in things like this.
- I got it!

341
00:26:49,592 --> 00:26:52,222
Impressive!

342
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:54,252
Gee, Willakers!

343
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:58,864
Great. Bingo! This is the best treehouse ever!

344
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:01,163
A red piano.

345
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:04,652
- Is this a dream?
- Stand by and catch me.

346
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:09,215
- It's much better than a tree!
- I just adore a penthouse view!

347
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:12,083
Nice one, Hawke.

348
00:27:12,084 --> 00:27:14,658
- You like it?
- Sure, Ian.

349
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,649
- I live here.
- It's so beautiful.

350
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:22,959
The last time we visited Meerkat Manor ...

351
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,171
Arrival group called the Commanders ...

352
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:28,754
was making large indoors in to the Whiskers' teritory.

353
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:39,419
Toby, I thought i was messy, 
but this is really disgusting.

354
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,355
I feel like livin' in a dumpster.

355
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:45,253
Simon, it's Meerkat Manor on it. Watch with me.

356
00:27:45,973 --> 00:27:50,545
You're right.
I thik I'll relax, feelin' my nerves little bit...

357
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:53,409
What is this?

358
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,234
You got to be joking? A taco.

359
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:58,799
In a blanket? Toby!

360
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:04,999
Ladies and gentlemen, goin' for his turkey
is the Tobster.

361
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,753
Come on baby.

362
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,840
No problem.
Watch and learn, my friends.

363
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:26,222
Oops, broken TV, I think this is the time
to play my second favorite game.

364
00:28:26,223 --> 00:28:28,957
Hide the broken TV from Dave.
You wanna play?

365
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:32,115
- No!!!
- Go easy on him, Taco Boy.

366
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:34,333
This day has been bad enough already.

367
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:40,349
Oh, I think I see what's going on.

368
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,663
- You guys are having some problems at school.
- No, not really ...

369
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:47,014
Unless you consider, having your head 
dumped in public toilet, a problem ...

370
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:52,642
Squirrelees are the worst.

371
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:54,634
At least, that's what I heard.

372
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:58,813
Because, there is no way that I possibly know that,
on a personal level.

373
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:02,143
Toby, what was school like for you?

374
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:41,164
- Toby? Tobyyy!!!
- What?

375
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,763
What was school like for me? In a word?

376
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:48,773
Awesome!
But, you know that 'cause I was like ...

377
00:29:48,774 --> 00:29:52,091
Extremely popular.

378
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:55,911
- Is that why you are still live with your grandmother?
- And refer to yourself as Tobster?

379
00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:58,656
And go peeoo-peeoo-peeoo all day?

380
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:02,350
Bed time.

381
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:12,664
Alvin! Alvin wake up and turn off the alarm.

382
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:21,980
Alvin, I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding, buddy, turn it off!

383
00:30:21,981 --> 00:30:24,403
Guys, guys ...

384
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:32,779
Boys, this isn't funny.

385
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,946
Hello? I need help.

386
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:39,001
A man got us.
He wants to take us to eternal place.

387
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:42,251
- School.
- Howgh!  - Have a heart.

388
00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:45,452
Have a heart. Dave wants you to school,
so you are goin'.

389
00:30:45,453 --> 00:30:49,151
Don't worry about taking us three, Toby.
We gonna be all right.

390
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:52,353
- If it hurts?
- Guys, come on.

391
00:30:52,354 --> 00:30:55,641
Trust me, the second day is
never as bad as the first.

392
00:31:00,955 --> 00:31:03,815
Glasses! Glasses! 
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would y...

393
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:07,543
Right in the pancreas.

394
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:15,182
Nurse?

395
00:31:16,753 --> 00:31:21,466
C'mon, Alvin! Remember the five D's!
Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge!

396
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:24,222
You're next, furball.

397
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:26,780
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me?

398
00:31:26,781 --> 00:31:30,501
I'm the only one here, so you must be talkin' to me.

399
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:40,438
- Did you see that?
- Hallelujah!

400
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:43,109
Unbelievable, he caught it.
You're out, man.

401
00:31:44,241 --> 00:31:46,958
And the tackle made, she got's in.

402
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,609
- He got hands.
- I think that's paws actually.

403
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,268
We can definitely use him on the team.

404
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:56,862
Hey, furball, how would you like a spot
in the football team?

405
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:59,754
- Football? Moi?
- I got to say you're good.

406
00:31:59,755 --> 00:32:02,091
I'm gonna let you hangin' out with us at lunch.

407
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:05,520
That is, if you wanna be on the team?

408
00:32:05,521 --> 00:32:07,827
- Interesting proposition.
- Alvin?

409
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:11,069
- Maybe I'll get back to you on that.
- This is a one-time offer.

410
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,839
Don't take too long and think it over .

411
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,565
Great, but I will dish my brothers!

412
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:20,571
Just to become the first chipmunk ever to 
play an actual pose on a football team.

413
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,266
No chance.

414
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:26,672
The stadium is unanimous.

415
00:32:26,673 --> 00:32:31,683
It stots and goes, it's out, it's out...
and he catches it!

416
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,909
The crowd goes crazy.

417
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:40,220
Me?

418
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:47,942
I think that super cool jock table
is paging you.

419
00:32:48,614 --> 00:32:50,167
Why would I go over there?

420
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,849
Look, if I really need to worry about being popular.

421
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,640
Hello, talking Chipmunk.
World-famous rock star ...

422
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,460
Dive with his own flesh doll.
Guys, I'm on pajamas.

421
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:03,967
Not to toot my own horn bike.

422
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:08,614
Come on, it's delectable.

423
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:11,351
- Just go, Alvin.
- Really? You really mean it?

424
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:14,313
- Yeah.
- Thanks. I'll be right back.

425
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:19,501
- What's up, geeks?
- What's up, man?

426
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:22,415
Bring it.

427
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:33,508
I got it, I got it I...

429
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:36,251
Not.

430
00:33:36,252 --> 00:33:38,839
- I think he's cute.
- Me too.

431
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,089
Toss.

432
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:49,580
Call me.

433
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:53,921
I'm tellin' you, Chipmunks are old news.
I got the next big thing.

434
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:57,267
Singing female Chipmunks.

435
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:05,296
God, what part of singing female chipmunks
some of this people do not understand...

436
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:11,863
Girls, we are goin' to school.

437
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:15,539
He's up, and he scores.

438
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:22,059
Hey, right up, ass? Wow, don't hate on a high five?

439
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:24,940
Yeah, high five.

440
00:34:24,941 --> 00:34:29,499
Look Alvin, I know you've guys been busy with
your sporting gathers and what not...

441
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,187
- But I can really use your help at home.
- Oh, no can do.

442
00:34:33,188 --> 00:34:36,268
Ryan is gonna teach me how 
to get pretty girls to do my homework.

443
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,854
Alvin, you promised Theodore we hang out.

444
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:44,115
We are watching Meerkat Manor tonight.
No pretty girls.

445
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:48,110
- Dude, I can't swing it today.
- That's what you say every day, Alvin.

446
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:50,451
Not to remind you it's your day to do the laundry.

447
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:54,346
Better listen to your daddy, Alvin.
You don't wanna get grounded?

448
00:34:56,508 --> 00:35:00,913
- Are you going to pick that up?
- Are you going to make me?

449
00:35:00,914 --> 00:35:05,695
Au contraire, mon frère!
I'm just going to elegantly show you how it's done.

450
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:13,717
Off the glass.
And you call yourself a jar.

451
00:35:17,674 --> 00:35:22,238
My brother, he's a real jokester.
Always do.

452
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,146
I'll see you guys around.

453
00:35:26,778 --> 00:35:29,085
- That's my play.
- That's my play.

454
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:32,719
Why are you tryin' to embarrass
me in front of my friends?

455
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:35,704
Are you kidding me?
They are the ones which should be embarrassed by.

456
00:35:35,705 --> 00:35:38,546
- Good luck with the show, guys.
- First row seats. Can't wait!

457
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:40,711
So, which song are we gonna sing?

458
00:35:40,712 --> 00:35:43,566
No pressure, but the whole school
is counting on us.

459
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:47,457
Oh, relax! It's like Ryan said: 
Who's gonna beat singing chipmunks?

460
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:15,984
Finally. Oh, Simon is dreamy.

461
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:18,916
- I think Theodore was looking at me!
- Yeah, I know.

462
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:22,474
But guys remember what Ian said?
We can't trust them.

463
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:46,071
- What happened?
- I never thought I'd say this but... 

464
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:50,538
- Pink is my new favourite colour.
- Her glasses were quite fetching.

465
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:53,566
She's like a beautiful green gumdrop.

466
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:57,494
If you guys want to do this
you got to pay attention.

467
00:36:57,495 --> 00:37:00,989
- Maybe, this is a good time for us to take a break.
- Good call,take five.

468
00:37:02,184 --> 00:37:05,073
She's right. We need to focus.

469
00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:07,754
This is for my screen saver.

470
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:12,229
- Hey buzz!
- Hey guys? Are you guys ready to go?

471
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:14,175
'Cause I've got a lot of important staff 
to do at home.

472
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:19,018
- You must be their guardian?
- God, that I am. Yes I am.

473
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:23,148
Hi. How are you, Dr Rubin?
I know that because I went to school here a few years ago.

474
00:37:23,149 --> 00:37:27,829
I don't know if you remember me,
Toby Seville probably not...

475
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:34,025
Toby? No way? Hi! Hey, no braces.

476
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:38,514
- I think it's great.
- I did ...

477
00:37:38,514 --> 00:37:42,063
I did get the braces off,'cause they were just...

478
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,966
I know a guy who actually works on drum heads.
I'll be in the car, guys.

479
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:03,324
Somebody is in love.

480
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:07,018
We are going to replace everything.
Chipmunks' honor.

481
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:10,643
The old false modestly suck up routine.

482
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:14,493
- I thought I smelled a rat.
- May I help you Mr Hawke?

483
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:18,123
I was wondering if I could help you,
Ijust heard about your musical competition ...

484
00:38:18,124 --> 00:38:21,175
and I just get down here as quickly as I could                                                                        
to volunteer my girls.

485
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:25,082
That's very thoughtful of you,
but I've already made up my mind.

486
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:28,878
Perhaps this will change your mind.

487
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:30,725
Girls.

488
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:35,144
They are with Ian?

489
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:40,418
One, two, one, two ...

490
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:10,331
They're astounding.

491
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:46,671
Good people of West Eastman, you have 
just witnessed the debut... 

492
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:49,474
Of the Chipettes!

493
00:39:49,475 --> 00:39:51,417
Thank you!

494
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:56,800
- Well?
- They were splendid. But as I said before...

495
00:39:56,801 --> 00:40:00,443
I have made my decision.

496
00:40:01,558 --> 00:40:04,732
I see.
You've made your decision.

497
00:40:06,175 --> 00:40:10,955
I don't need to speak out of school doctor, 
but in the true spirit of democracy ...

498
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:15,337
which our great wonderful country was
founded upon...

499
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:18,408
I say, let the people vote.

500
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:23,776
Let them choose.
One person, one vote, I say, let us vote!

501
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:26,959
Let us vote.

502
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,878
Let us vote.

503
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:33,202
Please don't be a flasher granby...

504
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:35,456
let them sing.

505
00:40:35,457 --> 00:40:37,958
Let us vote.

506
00:40:40,652 --> 00:40:43,157
You make a persuasive case, Mr Hawke.

507
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,199
All right, here is what I'm going to do.

508
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,598
This friday, each group will perform
one song in front of the student body.

509
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:55,324
Whoever gets the most applause, well,
will represent the school.

510
00:40:55,325 --> 00:40:56,937
What?

511
00:40:57,653 --> 00:41:01,380
Thank you. We made it.

512
00:41:01,381 --> 00:41:03,986
Oh, it is on, like Donkey Kong!

513
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:09,660
The Meerkats huddle together, at
the end of a dramatic day ...

514
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:12,290
to reaffirm their family bond.

515
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:16,197
The whiskers are going to have
to rely on each other more than ever.

516
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:20,259
Guys, I'm so happy that Mrs Ortega
can rehearsal with us every day after school.

517
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,397
- Wow! Every day?
- Stop right there, ok!

518
00:41:24,397 --> 00:41:27,509
We are the team, we need you.

519
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,320
Would you relax? We are not going to lose.

520
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,856
We'll talk about this in the morning.

521
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,245
Not much to talk about.
I will see you at the rehearsal.

522
00:41:38,335 --> 00:41:40,745
- Stop huggin'.
- I am not huggin'.

523
00:41:40,746 --> 00:41:46,089
You might as well be really obstacles 
in the face countryside because you are in fact huggin'.

524
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:50,224
- I'm not.
- I saw, and saw...

525
00:41:50,225 --> 00:41:52,750
I think I will sleep in my own bed tonight.

526
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:55,521
You know for me, I'm so glad I'm not a meerkat.

527
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,711
- Oh, really? And why is that?
- I would never hug with you!

528
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:16,056
Toby, can I sleep with you?

529
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:22,019
- What?
- Be kind to me.

530
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,746
My brothers are fighting.

531
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:29,875
What? Geeeee... ok.

532
00:42:39,728 --> 00:42:42,797
Man, Dutch Oven!

533
00:42:42,798 --> 00:42:47,241
Not the Dutch Oven!
Anything but the Dutch Oven! I can’t breath!

534
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:51,591
It's to late! It burns! It burns!

535
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:17,042
Now, let's see. What else am I in the mood for?

536
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:20,473
How about a side order of friendly advice, courtesy of me?

537
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:22,582
No, thanks.

538
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:24,622
Grapes, please.

539
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:31,395
Heh, heh. Excuse me. Ahem. 
So, uh, well, I, I, I just wanted to warn you... about Ian.

540
00:43:31,395 --> 00:43:33,867
What?

541
00:43:33,868 --> 00:43:38,754
You should be grateful to him. 
He did everything for you, Alvin, and you broke his heart.

542
00:43:38,755 --> 00:43:41,862
Hmm,really. How do I put this gently! 

543
00:43:41,863 --> 00:43:44,409
He's the devil, 
he doesn't have a heart,

544
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:47,970
and one of the things he did for us 
was put us in a cage!

545
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:52,843
- Oh, Alvin, he would never do that.
- Yeah, guess, you were there, I forgot... 

546
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:55,651
- You, you'd better watch out.
- I don't need any advice from you.

547
00:43:55,652 --> 00:43:58,872
-But...
-But, nothing, Alvin! Ian's taking us straight to the tooooooopppp!

548
00:44:02,668 --> 00:44:05,573
Right, straight to the top. I got it. 

549
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:08,707
Yeah, funny. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

550
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:16,325
Hah, hah we are, so, going to destroy those Chipmunks!

551
00:44:16,326 --> 00:44:19,699
- I don't want to destroy them.
- Me neither. I just want to hang out with them.

552
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,489
All right, look. If you feel that way ...

553
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,849
- Maybe we should just withdraw from the contest.
- What?!

554
00:44:26,882 --> 00:44:30,221
I'll put you all in Fedex package and mail you
back to whatever tree you came from.

555
00:44:30,222 --> 00:44:33,775
Sounds good? Ok then.
Take room from the top. Let's go!

556
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:40,898
Wow, wow stop.
Short one in a green dress... 

557
00:44:40,899 --> 00:44:42,625
- what's your name again?
- Eleanor.

558
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:46,101
Yeah, look. I'm losin' you there, you know.
Have you always been that short?

559
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:49,324
- I guess.
- You've got to work on that.

560
00:44:49,325 --> 00:44:52,423
Ok, all right. Let me try somethin' here.

561
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:55,542
Brittany, here. Come up here.
No, you two stay back.

562
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:59,413
A little further.

563
00:44:59,414 --> 00:45:01,755
Oh, yeah! Now that I like!

564
00:45:01,756 --> 00:45:05,422
It's not just because Brittany is more 
than mega-ultra superstar than you guys.

565
00:45:05,423 --> 00:45:10,519
Good, good. Ok, you know what, let's get a 
little more separation. Brittany, stay there.

566
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:15,399
Get a little more separation from you guys. 
Give her some room! Give her some room, guys.

568
00:45:15,432 --> 00:45:19,041
All right. Watch me now.

569
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:22,546
One, two, three ... Watch me.
Watch me now.

570
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,723
- Hello?
- Toby?

571
00:45:34,724 --> 00:45:37,805
What are you doing in the house?
Where is Aunt Jacky?

572
00:45:37,806 --> 00:45:42,542
Dave, hey Dave, what's happenin'?

573
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:48,698
Aunt Jacky is in the hospital.

574
00:45:51,228 --> 00:45:54,153
I am a little worried.
Who's watcin' the boys?

575
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:57,608
I am.

576
00:45:58,433 --> 00:46:02,170
- So, Dave, how is Paris?
- Wait, are the boys behaving?

577
00:46:02,171 --> 00:46:04,838
Absolutely. They've been just pitchy.

578
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:09,034
- Toby, what's going on?
- Nothing. Don't even worry about it.

579
00:46:09,035 --> 00:46:12,285
You know, I know that you're not suppose to be stress down.

580
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:15,717
-So I'm gonna go right now, but it's all good here.
Come home soon. Bye.
- Toby? Toby?

581
00:46:19,891 --> 00:46:23,623
Nurse, get me out of here!

582
00:46:23,624 --> 00:46:26,838
Help...

583
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:31,917
I don't mean to interrupt your game but I
saw you stand up to Ryan when he littered...

584
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:33,812
- That's to guts.
- Really?

585
00:46:33,813 --> 00:46:37,696
That's the kind of guy we are looking for.
Jeremy Smith, Student body president.

586
00:46:37,697 --> 00:46:40,096
- How do you do, I am ...
- International recording star ...

587
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,590
- And litter monitor Simon Seville.
- Litter monitor? 

588
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:46,073
Litter monitor, 
it's a new position that we've created,

590
00:46:46,074 --> 00:46:49,419
to help raise awareness to the presssing problem 
in our society.

591
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,125
I agree 99% plus 1.

592
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:55,265
You did the math.

593
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:58,156
Simon, I know this is a lot to ask...

594
00:46:58,157 --> 00:47:03,964
We are lookin' for a take-charge guy who
take charge of this very rewarding position.

595
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:06,628
What do you say?

596
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:09,354
Excuse me, everybody.
Quick announcement.

597
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:12,493
I'm Simon, I am the Litter monitor.
Put your trash in a garbage can. He's out.

598
00:47:15,782 --> 00:47:20,253
Hello, ladies.
You are probably unaware that you've thrown
a racker on the ground, so ...

599
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,770
We gonna just call this morning warning.

600
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,432
Carry on.

601
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:28,817
- Right up, dudes?
- What up, pal!

602
00:47:28,818 --> 00:47:33,272
Hey, everybody! Check it out.
The newest member of the football team.

603
00:47:33,273 --> 00:47:37,969
- Soon enough for his first away game.
- Guys, don't mess with me.

604
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:40,513
I talked to couch.
You are in.

605
00:47:40,514 --> 00:47:43,500
- That's great. Awesome.
- So, check it out, hey man...

606
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:45,315
We are watchin' the new litter monitor.

607
00:47:45,316 --> 00:47:48,571
I even wasn't aware that school even had
a litter monitor.

608
00:47:48,572 --> 00:47:51,183
It don't but don't tell him that.

609
00:47:53,143 --> 00:47:55,862
- Are you goin' to pick it up?
- No.

610
00:47:55,862 --> 00:48:01,714
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, 
I guess I'm going to have to, anyway a tuition.

611
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:08,109
No, I got a suition from littery.

612
00:48:09,982 --> 00:48:14,106
Oh, you wanna play that game, do you?
Guess what, I can play that game all day long.
- Simon!

613
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:16,167
It's a joke, dude.

614
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:17,702
Litter is no joking matter.

615
00:48:17,703 --> 00:48:20,527
You're the joke.
We are messing with you.

616
00:48:20,528 --> 00:48:22,882
There is no such a thing as Litter monitor.

617
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:25,251
What?
Big liar, huh!

618
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:30,337
You knew about this, Alvin?
Spelling "brother" mean anything to you?

619
00:48:30,338 --> 00:48:32,602
Yes, of course.

620
00:48:32,603 --> 00:48:35,293
Well, yes he has some new brothers
now he is on football team.

621
00:48:37,274 --> 00:48:40,856
You still hadn't pick up that litter.

622
00:48:40,857 --> 00:48:42,553
Want me to get rid of litter?

623
00:48:42,554 --> 00:48:45,656
- Let's start with you.
- Hey, let go, let go. Noooo!!

624
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:50,393
Touch down.

625
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:55,568
I'll catch with you guys in a second.

626
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:07,982
Ok, I'm a total jerk, I admit.

625
00:49:07,983 --> 00:49:10,719
So are we cool now?

626
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:25,190
Ok, I'm going to put this behind us ...

627
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:27,122
- For Theodore's sake.
- I know.

628
00:49:27,123 --> 00:49:28,889
That's why I'm giving you my...

629
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:32,866
The Alvin currency that I will be on
that stage Friday night.

630
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,439
Wait, wait, wait! 
Why woudn't you be there?

631
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,714
Because I had a...

632
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:42,761
- What?
- I...

633
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:46,110
- You have a what?
- A socker ball game. Now I said it.

634
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:48,889
A football game.

635
00:49:56,289 --> 00:49:59,274
- Simon, Alvin is everything alrigt?
- Theodore. Hello!

636
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:03,147
Yes, we are fine.
Just a little dumpster wrestling.

637
00:50:03,148 --> 00:50:05,837
- It's crazy in here.
- Right.

638
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:12,687
Don't worry Theo, everything is gonna be fine.

639
00:50:12,688 --> 00:50:17,120
- Alvin, do not miss that Sing all.
- Don't worry, Simon.

640
00:50:17,121 --> 00:50:20,237
I'll be there. I can prove.

641
00:50:20,238 --> 00:50:23,470
Hey guys, thanks so much for helping out today.

642
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:28,085
"Toys for Tots" is a really cool organization.
So, everybody is gettin' cool points today.

643
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,922
- What's goin' with Theodore?
- I have no idea.

644
00:50:38,321 --> 00:50:41,299
- Hey Eleanor, why don't you see if Theodore needs some help?
- Ok.

645
00:50:59,547 --> 00:51:04,230
- They don't look very comfortable.
- My shoes?

646
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:08,954
- They are not.
- But Ian says that I need to work on being higher.

647
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:13,510
Well... I think you look great just the way you are.

648
00:51:14,365 --> 00:51:17,617
You do?

649
00:51:25,526 --> 00:51:28,450
Hi, you've reached Dave Seville,
please leave a message.

650
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:32,715
Hi, Toby.
This is Julie Ortega, we talked yesterday...

651
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:37,114
a sort of it.
Anyway, the reason I'm calling,

652
00:51:37,115 --> 00:51:41,724
is that I am worried about Theodore,
he's been acting a little down lately.

653
00:51:42,964 --> 00:51:45,072
I hope you are going to the "Sing All" Friday.

654
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:48,411
You know in his down, 
Theodore needs all the support he can get.

655
00:51:48,507 --> 00:51:55,375
So, I'll see you there.
I hope we get a chance to talk. Bye.

656
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:05,277
<i>Ok, folks. Time to get behind your Warriors...<i>

657
00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:09,566
<i>They are listening Eagles down by five, 
with only thirty seconds left on the game.<i>

658
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:14,400
<i>- Time is running out for the ...
- ...He really needs to make a move here or...<i>

659
00:52:14,401 --> 00:52:17,439
<i>This game is over.<i>
- I know, put me in.

660
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,895
Hey, put me in.

661
00:52:23,414 --> 00:52:26,211
- Time out, Time out.
<i>Time out Eagles<i>

662
00:52:26,212 --> 00:52:29,075
<i>Number 15 got nine seconds to make it to the game.<i>

663
00:52:34,773 --> 00:52:37,906
All right boys, it's time for the big A.

664
00:52:37,907 --> 00:52:42,231
I'm going to crush them and burn them to pain.
The Alvinator is in the house.

665
00:52:42,232 --> 00:52:43,491
Are you sure about this?

666
00:52:43,587 --> 00:52:45,537
Four to ten say that we need to go
for the secret weapon.

667
00:52:45,633 --> 00:52:48,591
Chip is right.
He left decision on me.
 
668
00:52:48,592 --> 00:52:51,743
Time to make history, boys.

669
00:52:59,222 --> 00:53:02,630
I'm taking you down, Jennifer.

670
00:53:02,631 --> 00:53:05,294
You are the one going down, rat face.

671
00:53:05,294 --> 00:53:08,657
I'm going to crack you like an acorn 
and eat you for dinner.

672
00:53:08,658 --> 00:53:11,503
With some fava beans and a nice chianti.

673
00:53:12,715 --> 00:53:16,456
Is this something about my father?

674
00:53:16,457 --> 00:53:19,622
One, two ...

675
00:53:28,024 --> 00:53:30,816
I'm comin'!

676
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:43,259
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Don't hate the pain, hate the game.

677
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,880
I love the hunt, man.

678
00:53:45,881 --> 00:53:49,528
<i>Final score: Eagles 15. The Warriors 14<i>

679
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:54,354
What you think about that, sucker?

680
00:53:54,355 --> 00:53:57,616
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You're really muscle chipmunk.

681
00:53:57,617 --> 00:54:02,126
Give me a A, give me an O,
give me a W, give me an E, give me a M...

682
00:54:02,127 --> 00:54:04,906
How that spell...awesome.

683
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:07,698
I am the king of the world.

684
00:54:08,923 --> 00:54:10,743
Party with Alvin.

685
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:13,274
Everybody to the beach house.

686
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:15,502
Let's do it.

687
00:54:21,643 --> 00:54:25,013
Look guys, 
I just want you to know that I'm here for you.

688
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:29,293
There is plenty of time.I'm gonna go find Alvin.
Everything is gonna work out.

689
00:54:29,795 --> 00:54:34,553
-Thank you, Toby.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Rubin<i>

690
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,866
<i>Thank you, students.Thank you.<i>

691
00:54:38,867 --> 00:54:41,927
Welcome to our exiciting "Sing All" Competition ...

692
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:44,990
Between the Chipmunks
and the Chipettes.

693
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:52,929
Remember students, there
are no winners or losers.

694
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:56,288
Remind me to tell the Chipmunks that one,
when we blow up off the stage.

695
00:54:56,289 --> 00:55:01,068
...To our school, a chance to win 25 000 dollars
to save our music department.

696
00:55:01,069 --> 00:55:05,016
So, without further due,
I give you ... the Chipettes.

697
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:10,083
This is it girls, can you believe it.

698
00:55:10,084 --> 00:55:13,280
Brittany, your time to shine baby.

699
00:55:13,281 --> 00:55:16,794
- Go up there and knock them dead.
- Yes sir, I can do it.

700
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,127
- You two I just wanna let you know, not to get in Brittany's way.
- Ah, ok.

701
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,269
You like what you see,
call Ian Hawke ...

702
00:56:09,368 --> 00:56:12,963
310-555-5309.

703
00:56:15,091 --> 00:56:18,909
Don't worry, Simon, Alvin will walk
through that door any minute now.
Alvin!

704
00:56:24,522 --> 00:56:27,277
I'm back.

705
00:56:36,545 --> 00:56:42,391
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- Well done, ladies.

706
00:56:42,425 --> 00:56:47,853
And now, let teared for the group that
will rock you like a hurricane.

707
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:51,546
At least that is what many of you
students have told me.

708
00:56:51,547 --> 00:56:54,855
Here they are...the Chipmunks.

709
00:56:56,223 --> 00:57:00,034
Hey, you know they say there is no "I" in
the word "team", and they are right.

710
00:57:00,035 --> 00:57:03,229
But,you know where is "IN" ?
Alvin.

711
00:57:04,998 --> 00:57:07,752
Such to be you. 
Girls!

712
00:57:07,753 --> 00:57:10,504
Sadly, he's correct.

713
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:15,645
- Did you find him?
- Guys, sorry, I searched the whole perimeter.

714
00:57:15,646 --> 00:57:18,104
And I don't know why, but
the team is not back yet.

715
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:20,733
What should we do?

716
00:57:21,793 --> 00:57:24,548
I would ...

717
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:28,700
I would ask someone...who's not me.

718
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:32,091
I know what we should do.

719
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:45,018
Hi, everyone.

720
00:57:47,742 --> 00:57:51,094
Our brother, Alvin couldn't be here today.

721
00:57:52,253 --> 00:57:55,658
Thing is, we never performed without Alvin ..

722
00:57:55,754 --> 00:57:59,853
and we are not starting now.

723
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:05,669
You can't have two little pigs,
you can't have only two musketeers so...

724
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:09,298
You know you can't have only two chipmunks.

725
00:58:10,258 --> 00:58:11,508
Thank you.

726
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:24,096
I'll take you home.

727
00:58:35,434 --> 00:58:36,959
You hear that, girls? 

728
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,899
That...is the sound of success.

730
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,047
I relize how devastated you...

731
00:58:47,048 --> 00:58:49,119
Chipmunks' funs must be...

732
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:54,600
So I guess that means that the Chipettes...

733
00:58:54,601 --> 00:58:57,330
Come on girls, let's take a victory lap.

734
00:58:58,913 --> 00:59:00,857
Hey, come on guys, let's go.

735
00:59:00,858 --> 00:59:02,814
Britt, we have to.

736
00:59:02,815 --> 00:59:04,840
Let's go.

737
00:59:09,187 --> 00:59:11,053
Thank you.

738
00:59:19,596 --> 00:59:20,979
Life is good.

739
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:23,792
Especially when you're not a loser.

740
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,419
Hey guys? I'm here.

741
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:30,108
Guys?

742
00:59:30,889 --> 00:59:32,645
Oh, great.

743
00:59:32,646 --> 00:59:34,279
They are gone, Alvin.

744
00:59:35,068 --> 00:59:38,504
- They never gonna forgive me.
- You know ... Alvin...

745
00:59:38,505 --> 00:59:42,407
Ian was right.
You don't care about anyone except yourself.

746
00:59:47,936 --> 00:59:51,849
And oh, by the way, 
I never wanna to win this way.

747
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:10,837
Simon, are you awake?

748
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,538
Theodore, I don't blame you for being mad.

749
01:00:45,168 --> 01:00:47,366
I ran away from home?

750
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:50,463
Don't look for me in the Zoo,
because I'm not there.

751
01:00:50,464 --> 01:00:52,401
Oh, no Theodore ...

752
01:00:58,271 --> 01:00:59,787
Hello?

753
01:01:00,669 --> 01:01:03,158
Meerkat family?

754
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:10,975
Is anyone home?

755
01:01:11,732 --> 01:01:15,142
My name is Theodore, I like to be in your family.

756
01:01:22,286 --> 01:01:23,966
Maybe they are hiding.

757
01:01:23,967 --> 01:01:25,275
Don't be afraid.

758
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:34,645
You are not a meerkat!

759
01:01:35,189 --> 01:01:37,968
Toby, you take the lions,
the tigers and the bears ...

760
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:40,042
Simon and I will take the butterfly room.

761
01:01:40,842 --> 01:01:42,637
Nice Eagle.

762
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,886
Don't move Theodore.

763
01:01:45,887 --> 01:01:48,121
No problem there.

764
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:51,055
Hang in there, hang little guy.
We'll get you out from there.

765
01:01:53,428 --> 01:01:56,622
Ok, we need a plan. 
And we need carefuly executed plan.

766
01:01:57,256 --> 01:02:00,115
Or you can just ride in there like a maniac.

767
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:02,837
Theo, watch out.

768
01:02:02,838 --> 01:02:05,135
Hi, I'm Theodore ...

769
01:02:07,405 --> 01:02:09,920
Hey birdy, look up in here, are you hungry?
Catch this "A"?

770
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:12,293
That's for appetizer.

771
01:02:15,055 --> 01:02:17,745
Let's all just relax, and
we talk this out, ok!

772
01:02:18,863 --> 01:02:23,842
Look, I guess why you want Theodore, I do, 

773
01:02:23,938 --> 01:02:27,293
but I'm sorry, I can't let that happen.

774
01:02:28,256 --> 01:02:29,313
He's my brother.

775
01:02:29,314 --> 01:02:34,465
Not let him know that, because
I've been a such a big jerk lately.

776
01:02:37,148 --> 01:02:40,361
If anyone deserves to be eaten, it's me.

777
01:02:42,899 --> 01:02:44,339
Not really.

778
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:46,151
I got you, Alvin.

779
01:02:52,211 --> 01:02:53,662
Watch to the eagle.

780
01:02:53,663 --> 01:02:57,686
Their only mortal enemy is a piggy elephant.
Luckily I speak a little habitat.

781
01:03:02,586 --> 01:03:04,037
I think it's working.

782
01:03:13,712 --> 01:03:15,394
Guys, that was huge.

783
01:03:15,968 --> 01:03:20,657
He's right.Now we are one for all
and three for one?

784
01:03:21,945 --> 01:03:23,859
Come on, Simon, hug it out.

785
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,573
You know I'm sorry, Sy.

786
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,256
Sy, don't make me up to kiss you because 
I'll do it.

787
01:03:31,257 --> 01:03:33,691
I don't care. 

788
01:03:34,653 --> 01:03:38,031
Here come the lips!
The makeout train leaving the station.

789
01:03:40,778 --> 01:03:42,864
I think after all, I'll take that hug.

790
01:03:52,427 --> 01:03:54,748
Justine, call Ian Hawke.

791
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:58,230
310-555-5309.

792
01:03:58,231 --> 01:04:01,104
Morris, get me that Ian Hawke
on the phone.

793
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,812
There you are.

794
01:04:06,813 --> 01:04:08,780
My sweet little money makers.

795
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:13,763
Do you remember when I told you
that I would make you all big stars?

796
01:04:15,487 --> 01:04:18,429
Well, guess who's opening up for Britney Spears
at Staples Center tonight?

797
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:21,771
Am I dreamin'? oh, my gosh!

798
01:04:21,772 --> 01:04:24,570
Oh, wait, we can't. 
We'll miss the school concert!

799
01:04:25,009 --> 01:04:27,913
That's correct.
You will miss the school contest.

800
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:30,292
You are so smart, I can't never get 
anything being passed by you.

801
01:04:30,293 --> 01:04:37,509
It was never about that stupid school contest,
it was always about making Brittany a star.

802
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:39,395
That's what you wanted, right?

803
01:04:41,523 --> 01:04:44,645
- well...yes.
- Tonight is your big chance.

804
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:46,745
It's all about you, Brittany.

805
01:04:46,746 --> 01:04:49,130
But what about Jeanette and Eleanor?

806
01:04:49,131 --> 01:04:52,173
They can sing backups,
I got them some staff too.

807
01:04:53,546 --> 01:04:59,056
- We are her sisters.
- We either sing together or not at all!

808
01:04:59,986 --> 01:05:02,825
Ok, fine.
All I ever needed is the B-girl.

809
01:05:05,127 --> 01:05:07,140
Ian, I won't do it without them.

810
01:05:09,876 --> 01:05:12,473
Ok, fine, fine. Let's move on to Plan B.

811
01:05:12,474 --> 01:05:15,349
Ok, who likes barbecue?

812
01:05:16,703 --> 01:05:21,599
Because I know this awesome little barbecue restaurant in the valley, 
that makes the best roasted chipmunks.

813
01:05:23,037 --> 01:05:27,609
Real tasty.
Unless of course, you wanna sing?

814
01:05:35,373 --> 01:05:40,342
Welcome to West Eastman, and thank you
for supporting music in our schools.

815
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:45,735
Now remember,the group you pick tonight,
will win 25000 dollars for their school.

816
01:05:47,126 --> 01:05:50,948
Now there's got a lot of acts, and we have to 
trow heat off by nine-thirdy so ..

817
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:57,852
without no further due, representing Orange girl
put your hands together for...Lou Rosarro.

818
01:06:22,938 --> 01:06:26,545
We meet again.
You wanna a piece of it?

819
01:06:26,641 --> 01:06:28,410
Eagle.

820
01:06:31,709 --> 01:06:33,149
Ian Hawke?

821
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,230
I'll take that.

822
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:39,219
I didn't realise that you are runnin' a low life.

823
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:43,913
- Alvin, - Brittany?
- Aren't you guys still interest?

824
01:06:43,914 --> 01:06:46,543
I'm not gonna be able to perform tonight.

825
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,439
What about the music department?
The whole school is counting on you.

826
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,799
I know, I know.
I had to listen to you about Ian.

827
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,839
Don't tell me...

828
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,575
Yes, he locked us in a cage.

829
01:06:57,252 --> 01:07:01,872
This is this the biggest you have?
I have a licence to call and asked for the biggest thing,
that's not the biggest what you got.

830
01:07:01,873 --> 01:07:03,710
I will go and take the news to Dr Rubin.

831
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,996
- Brittany?
- Alvin, don't move.

832
01:07:06,997 --> 01:07:09,554
You got it.
Brittany, I'm comin' to get you.

833
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:12,208
Simon, how do you know to hit a lock?

834
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:13,111
Roger that.

835
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,847
I need to get to those girls.
Fast.

836
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:17,617
I know how.

837
01:07:30,984 --> 01:07:34,788
The third number is notoriously the hardest to crack ...

838
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:37,225
I'm assuming that provide number that we can't assume...

839
01:07:37,594 --> 01:07:41,136
The first two numbers are one.
I got to go with one.

840
01:07:41,169 --> 01:07:42,363
It opened.

841
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:44,045
- All right,  girls ...
- Ian is coming.

842
01:07:44,046 --> 01:07:45,764
Put the phone back, hurry!

843
01:07:45,765 --> 01:07:47,164
Get ready to be fabulous.

844
01:07:47,165 --> 01:07:48,635
We are ready.

845
01:07:48,636 --> 01:07:53,262
Yeah, you're better be.
Because tonight's performance it's gonna put me back on the top.

846
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,652
And now please welcome...Cherisse.

847
01:08:19,837 --> 01:08:24,371
Driver man, take me to the Arena.
The VIP entrance.

848
01:08:24,372 --> 01:08:28,538
Tout de suite.
A little moonroofs actions.

849
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:32,291
Moonroofs are go, moonroofs, roofs, roofs...

850
01:08:32,292 --> 01:08:34,448
Champagne.

851
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:36,987
If you don't mind ...
If I do...

852
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:42,476
You know why I don't mind if I do?
Because tonight we've got to toast ...

853
01:08:42,477 --> 01:08:47,069
To a very special someone, named me.

854
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:51,035
They said I couldn't do it, 
they said I never bounce back.

855
01:08:51,604 --> 01:08:55,102
Guess what?
Time to kiss my ass.

856
01:08:57,612 --> 01:09:02,781
A toast! To the ladies who gonna make the world forget
about the Chipmu...

857
01:09:09,533 --> 01:09:11,801
No, no, no, no! What are doin'? Alvin.

858
01:09:12,693 --> 01:09:15,244
Hi Ian! Good to see you. You look alright!

859
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,059
No, no! I signed a contract.

860
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:23,346
- Jump, Jeanette. -Wait!
- I'm not really good...

861
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,916
I bet it you don't perform.

862
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:27,766
- Gas, Alvin.
- You got it!

863
01:09:28,443 --> 01:09:31,595
Hey, Ian! In the words of McDonald, you're fired!

864
01:09:44,621 --> 01:09:48,048
- Hey guys, any sayin' about Alvin yet?
- No Alvin and no Chipettes.

865
01:09:48,049 --> 01:09:52,014
Just Dr Rubin and the entire school are counting on us.

866
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:58,772
Well, you know...you know don't worry
everything will work out...ish.

867
01:10:07,843 --> 01:10:09,447
- Faster Alvin!
- Don't worry...

868
01:10:09,448 --> 01:10:12,118
I'm gonna get a real help from my friend, stay there.

869
01:10:13,187 --> 01:10:15,295
Roger that Alvin.

870
01:10:15,296 --> 01:10:17,109
Just like I'm back on the racetrack.

871
01:10:18,822 --> 01:10:20,743
Where you going?
What are you doing?

872
01:10:22,733 --> 01:10:26,547
Wait 'til I tell everybody back home that
I've saved Alvin Seville.

873
01:10:26,548 --> 01:10:28,745
I think I owe you an apology about Ian.

874
01:10:28,746 --> 01:10:31,451
Stick with me Britt.
I'll never stay alive.

875
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:35,076
Oh yeah , I'll never got to do that.

876
01:10:38,423 --> 01:10:41,014
I got to say, he's definitely persistant.

877
01:10:44,169 --> 01:10:46,507
- We got to lose him.
- Hang on.

878
01:10:48,151 --> 01:10:50,723
I got a plan, jump on a count of three!

879
01:10:50,804 --> 01:10:52,789
Three.

880
01:10:53,129 --> 01:10:56,344
- Oh, that's it.
- I didn't like heights.

881
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:59,302
- Keep your tight Jeanette.
- Bring my girls right to me.

882
01:10:59,303 --> 01:11:02,623
- We need a  remote.
- Guys, I know what to do.

883
01:11:02,624 --> 01:11:04,477
Hats off on Ian.

884
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,461
The remote.

885
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,428
I can't reach it.

886
01:11:15,429 --> 01:11:17,499
I'm doing it.
Hold my ankles.

887
01:11:21,452 --> 01:11:23,176
I got it.

889
01:11:23,683 --> 01:11:25,587
I got it?

890
01:11:26,676 --> 01:11:29,144
- Well done, Jen.
- Top work, Jeanette.

891
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:34,011
Hey Ian, you were wrong.
I don't need these.

892
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,979
- Bye bye.
- Adios, Ian.

893
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,741
And now, for our final act of the night...

894
01:11:47,742 --> 01:11:52,498
And, listen we have last second change to the line up,
but we don't think you gonna be to disapointed.

895
01:11:52,499 --> 01:11:56,606
Representing West Eastman it's...the Chipmunks.

896
01:12:00,802 --> 01:12:02,809
We may have to go up there , Theodore.

897
01:12:10,096 --> 01:12:12,419
If there are no Chipmunks
we gonna have to move on.

898
01:12:16,203 --> 01:12:18,297
I don't wanna be good again.

899
01:12:20,233 --> 01:12:21,785
I'm sorry, but we have to move on.

900
01:12:28,705 --> 01:12:31,287
I'm not a Chipmunk, as you can see.

901
01:12:38,668 --> 01:12:41,281
Where is the music you loser?
Where is the music? Music?!

902
01:12:45,481 --> 01:12:48,310
Ok, I got to song.

903
01:13:26,575 --> 01:13:28,605
Well, that...was huge.

904
01:13:32,465 --> 01:13:35,332
Thank you.

905
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:39,096
The Chipmunks are in the building.

906
01:13:39,842 --> 01:13:42,562
- It is the Chipettes!
- Alvin.

907
01:13:46,406 --> 01:13:48,629
Hello, West Eastman.

908
01:13:49,194 --> 01:13:52,214
I'm puttin' her down.
Hang on.

909
01:13:52,725 --> 01:13:54,399
- Alvin.
- Give me the high-five, brothers.

910
01:13:57,837 --> 01:14:01,171
Ladies and gentlemen, representing West Eastman 
it is my great pleasure...

911
01:14:03,082 --> 01:14:05,191
This is such an honor.

912
01:14:05,192 --> 01:14:07,742
- For you or for us?
- For us.

913
01:14:11,305 --> 01:14:13,684
We get it! Come up, guys.

914
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,773
And now I give you the Chipettes and the Chipmunks.

915
01:15:39,378 --> 01:15:42,563
Thank you.

916
01:15:44,434 --> 01:15:49,463
Hey everybody, it's clear that we have a
winner of the 25000 dollars ...

917
01:15:49,464 --> 01:15:51,229
And it's West Eastman High.

918
01:15:52,572 --> 01:15:54,570
Guys, we did it.

919
01:16:02,774 --> 01:16:04,837
It's all yours, Dr Rubin.

And we are the Chipettes.

924
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:33,072
One, two, three.

925
01:17:00,756 --> 01:17:03,947

- You are even good, Dave. Yeah!

926
01:17:03,948 --> 01:17:06,683

- So, did you miss us?

927
01:17:06,717 --> 01:17:09,684
Of course I missed you.
You are my boys.

928
01:17:10,287 --> 01:17:13,563
Ok Dave, just did how much you miss us.
There are now six of us.

929
01:17:13,564 --> 01:17:14,754
Alvin, what did you say?

930
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:17,746
The Chipettes need a place to cresche , right?

931
01:17:17,747 --> 01:17:22,948
So I said that you said, they can stay with us
for as long as they needed to.

932
01:17:24,596 --> 01:17:29,660
Ok, this works for Dave.
Everybody shake what your mama gave ya!

Looks like the Chipettes
had a good influence.

935
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:13,901

936
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:16,650

Sorry, but you've got school tomorrow.

Still not tired. More light.

944
01:18:43,099 --> 01:18:45,071
Tired. Just kidding.
Much more light.

945
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:47,326
Alvin, that's it!
Don't make me come over there...

946
01:18:52,588 --> 01:18:55,855
Oh boy, I finally got relly, really tired.
