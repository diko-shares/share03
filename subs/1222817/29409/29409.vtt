00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,114
U-turn at Gwang Myung crossroads. Be there soon.

3
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,095
Wake up. Show time.

4
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,883
Hyung Tack, Sang Gon front entrance,

00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:13,278
Jung Ho and Sang Min the stairways. Yup.

6
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,860
If this guy is packing, he can be dangerous so stay close.

7
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:18,480
I said we needed back up, damn it.

8
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,280
Awake now? Fuck you, I wasn't dozing.

9
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,295
Wrap this quick and put anend to this two months stakeout, alright?

10
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,380
He's here.

11
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,580
Quick.

12
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,880
Catch the big bird and don't bother with rest.

13
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,180
Move in when it's feeding.

14
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,680
Hello.

15
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,680
Food is transferred...

16
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,905
Sir, you shouldn't...- Hold it!

17
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,580
Don't move you motherfucker.

18
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,815
Yeah, I've got it.

19
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:03,780
Be there immediately.

20
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:39,019
He's moving.

21
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,270
What next?

22
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,670
Sure it changed hands? I saw it!...

23
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,462
Then why isn't he out yet?

24
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:47,849
I saw him handing over the stuff!

25
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,480
What now?

26
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,570
If he gets away, we're done!

27
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,525
Boss?... BOSS?!

28
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,180
Go!

29
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,280
Come on, son of bitch!

30
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,680
Don't move! You shit bag! You motherfucker!

31
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,773
Grab that guy!

32
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:15,968
Stop it!

33
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:17,712
Grab a hold of him!

34
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:19,659
You... motherfucker!

35
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:26,938
Heads up!

36
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,044
Make it quick! We need to write a reportbefore having dinner, you know.

37
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,166
Motherfucker!...

38
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,980
The package's gone...

39
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,811
Someone took it!

40
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:55,460
Damn it!

41
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:57,307
Take it easy...

42
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,280
Those motherfuckers really...

43
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:15,430
Crazy bitch!

44
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:35,680
Will you stop kneading them, uh?

45
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,785
Wanna make some sushi?

46
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,680
(Pawn shop)

47
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,680
Come out.

48
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,915
Wanna die?

49
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,237
I didn't steal the milk, you know.

50
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,470
It wasn't a big deal, really...

51
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,522
I don't steal anymore, you know...

52
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,871
Oh... Those flowers?

53
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,881
Youngchul, the boy from rice shop,

54
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:37,856
ran into him today at the loo.

55
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:40,474
and it was a real embarrassment you know..

56
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:43,223
Kids kept asking if I like him...

57
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:45,577
why on earth would I like him?

58
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:49,628
Oh! Look at my teeth. One of them feels loose.

59
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,907
Ever pulled your teeth?

60
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:53,365
Does it hurt alot?

61
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,197
Eh?

62
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,914
Mister?...

63
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,525
I knew it.

64
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,356
Why do I need to pull my teeth at this age...

65
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,680
I hate it...

66
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,800
Why is it 1,000?

67
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:22,679
You didn't pay me back 500 last time.

68
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:24,922
I've downloaded lots of new songs, you know.

69
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:26,332
The songs are all weird.

70
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:28,333
That's mean.

71
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,440
Hey?

72
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,286
What?

73
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:40,070
Give it back.

74
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,756
Eh? Sausage...

75
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:45,915
I like sausage, too you know.

76
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,736
why do you wanna make money?

77
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:57,227
Voila!

78
00:07:57,354 --> 00:08:00,907
Open a nail art shop of my own. I'm the best in class.

79
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,453
Want your nails done?

80
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,870
Men are doing it these days, you know.

81
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,220
Were you a gangster?

82
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,257
People say you did something badand hides here.

83
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:21,848
Mom tells me to be careful causeyou might be a sexual offender...

84
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,860
Are you?

85
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,099
Do you...

86
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,377
think I'm a bad guy?

87
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,210
I just thought you look good behind bars.

88
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,148
Jung Somee, are you in there again?- It's mom!...

89
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,944
I am not here, OK?

90
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,432
Mister!

91
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,693
Open this goddamn door!

92
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,834
Mister? Is Somee with you?

93
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:58,720
She isn't here.

94
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,340
I heard her.

95
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,537
If she isn't, then why areyou blocking the room with the door?

96
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,702
Jung Somee, I know you're in there. Get outta here now!

97
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,898
Let me see into the room...

98
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,630
Open up, will you?

99
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,660
Mister, what the hell are you doing?

100
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:34,680
Jung Somee, I'm going to give you a good whooping. if you don't come out right now!

101
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,279
What the..

102
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,570
She's really not here?

103
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,492
I'm warning you.

104
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:54,373
Don't ever ask my daughterinto your place?

105
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:56,875
If you ever do anything to Somee...

106
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,066
I forgive bastards who fuck married women.

107
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:03,251
But I'll never forgive bastards that touch children.

108
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,535
I will rip his balls off.

109
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:11,984
Well! If you're lonely, you couldask me out for a date, you know.

110
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,046
You don't look too bad.

111
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:17,266
I might even make love with you...

112
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:18,873
Right?

113
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:25,220
Chicken!

114
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,585
Beautiful, isn't it?

115
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,797
Don't touch the things that are not yours.

116
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,290
Are you smiling?

117
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,105
Tell your bossthat I will kill him once caught.

118
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,270
Day and night... have a fucking ball.

119
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,954
Fucking up the job that I ask you to do.

120
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:47,747
Think I'll ask someone else to get it back? You motherfucker!

121
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,695
I have guys out looking for it.

122
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:56,395
If I find out who fucked with me...- That's why I can't trust you guys...

123
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,645
Christ... look at those two for fuck's sake..

124
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,730
Who brought in that thick headed bastard?

125
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,110
Fucking Viet Cong.

126
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,262
1.6 billion Chinese are smoking Marijuana.

127
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:17,217
26 million are taking Methan Betamin.

128
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:19,237
and 11 million are doing Heroin.

129
00:12:19,248 --> 00:12:22,605
Isn't that an outright bonanza? UN says so!

130
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,736
Three days!

131
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:28,391
I can only hold off the Chinese guys for three days!

132
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:30,702
If you can't retrieve the sample heroin...

133
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:35,092
You and your fucking brother will bein the "Human Body Revealed" exhibition for display.

134
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,815
Since you're into organs harvesting, you do know what I mean?

135
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,700
Only way for this country to do well is to put guys like you into a concentration camp just like the Kwangju massacre.

136
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,318
Fucking bitch!

137
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,285
Are you crazy?

138
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,027
Where did you stash the stuff?

139
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:12,701
Speak up?

140
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,082
I took the risk...

141
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:21,215
I'm entitled to half. right?

142
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,720
Fucking whore...

143
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,283
Listen, slut...!

144
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:32,441
80/20 ain't bad, so bring it by tomorrow.

145
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,755
My ass!

146
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:38,636
Who can find me if I sell it off and disappear?

147
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,517
You must be set on going to hell... Do you realise who we've fucked?

148
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,665
Think wisely. Stupid bitch.

149
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:56,539
Like mother, like daughter. Fuck!

150
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,930
Go play outside.

151
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,794
Really! I'll go home, once mom's friends are gone.

152
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,778
Do you know what your nickname is?

153
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,265
Pawnshop ghost.

154
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,680
Guess what mine is?.

155
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,457
What is it?

156
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,060
I won't tell you.

157
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,980
Garbage can.

158
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,995
My aunt told me that when my mom conceived me,

159
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:06,768
she kicked a garbage can and had her toe broken.

160
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,351
Since then, I am a garbage can.

161
00:16:09,362 --> 00:16:10,760
Funny, isn't it?

162
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,166
Sleep.

163
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,964
A pawnshop ghost and a garbage can...

164
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:22,841
Sounds like some ID names on the net, isn't it?

165
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,725
Wish I could play a computer game.

166
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:00,978
"It had to be a rough job because of improper materials, Hope you'd be tolerant enough to find it cute"

167
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,933
What a naughty devil this is!

168
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,415
What's your mom's mobile phone number?

169
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:27,476
Answer me!

170
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:30,626
Oh... please stop hitting her. You may really hurt her.

171
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:32,187
Can't you see my child is hurt?

172
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:34,652
I am a taxpayer but what are you guys doing?

173
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:37,711
Allow begging kids like these wander round freely!

174
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,541
What's with the dirty look?

175
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:40,748
Your mother teach you to look at people like that?

176
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:41,870
Come here...

177
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:44,950
Did you steal that bag?

178
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,489
I didn't steal the bag..

179
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,781
I just wanted to see the difference from mine.

180
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,720
You don't have a bag, you beggar!

181
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,960
I told you not to touch her. She's full of germ.

182
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:03,926
Look. We need one of your parents to settle this.

183
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:06,044
Where's your mom?

184
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,380
Your dad?

185
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,625
Hey! Mister!

186
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,820
Mister!- Excuse me!

187
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:23,006
Hey!

188
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,130
Isn't he your dad?

189
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,680
Hello...

190
00:20:09,872 --> 00:20:10,836
Where are you?

191
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:16,294
Judging from your voice, I had quite a beating...

192
00:20:16,305 --> 00:20:19,378
Your brother went through the shitholewhile you're having a feast...

193
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:21,266
what an exemplary family it is, uh?

194
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:24,279
Easy does it... easy.

195
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,925
Life is simple, you know.

196
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:29,754
I got a call from Tochi. Find the bitch who siphoned our stuff.

197
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,235
Who?

198
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,200
The dancer?!

199
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,180
Are you mad at me?

200
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,040
Told you... you shouldn't steal.

201
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,765
How much for the stuff she just took?

202
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,076
Never mind...

203
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:30,531
Stealing is part of growing up.

204
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,510
Giving birth doesn't make one a parent. The poor thing is always alone by herself.

205
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,845
Like other dads, take her out with you more often.

206
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,885
Free, alright?

207
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:11,680
Give me back my MP3 player.

208
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,187
Since I don't have any money, I'll give you my treasure card.

209
00:22:20,198 --> 00:22:22,380
It's my most precious possession.

210
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:27,682
Goodnight, sir.

211
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:42,943
Mister...

212
00:22:42,954 --> 00:22:45,382
Mister, you're embarrassedabout me, aren't you?

213
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,310
That's why you pretended not to know me...

214
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:55,930
It's alright... My classmates feel thesame and so do the teachers.

215
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,562
Mom told me if I ever get lost,

216
00:22:59,573 --> 00:23:03,522
I should pretend not to know ouraddress nor phone numbers.

217
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:08,980
Everytime she's drunk, she keeps sayingwe should kill ourselves together.

218
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:15,267
You are worse than the fat bitch who calls me a beggar.

219
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,529
Still, I don't hate you.

220
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:25,750
If I come to hate you, there won'tbe a single person I'd like more in this world.

221
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,949
If I keep thinking about that, it really hurts here.

222
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:34,076
So, I'm not going to hate you.

223
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,530
Mom?

224
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,680
Mommy...

225
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,132
We're looking for something, you know...

226
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,197
It's better you came to help us.

227
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:24,485
Fuck! You think I'm a two bit robber?

228
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:34,469
Go.

229
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,230
Got it?

230
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,295
That's... we may have a situation here.

231
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:27,180
Who are you, mister?

232
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,861
Don't think of robbing this pawn shop...

233
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:32,681
I didn't call police so just get lost.

234
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,227
Fuck! Ain't you a fucking cool...

235
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,884
Alright! If I have what belongs to me, I'll leave.

236
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:42,751
Something was pawned yesterdayby a bitch named Park Hae jung.

237
00:26:42,762 --> 00:26:44,925
A camera bag. Give it to us.

238
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,120
Pawn shop takes half a month interest even for a day.

239
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,785
The principle 80,000 Won plus interest 1,600 Won. The goods are returned upon payment in person.

240
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,335
Really? I didn't know that.

241
00:26:58,641 --> 00:26:59,631
Please hold on...

242
00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:03,378
So, how can we resolve the issue...

243
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:06,674
Go on tell him. Quick!

244
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:09,579
God damn bitch!

245
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,184
Are you alright? Mom..

246
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,315
Mom... Wake up, mom... mom

247
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,436
Well! The situation now is the person is unable to retrieve said item. Understand?

248
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:25,686
Listen... Two of them are bout tokiss the world goodbye...

249
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,530
Fuck...

250
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,290
I got it.

251
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:08,412
What?

252
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,165
God damn, motherfucker...

253
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,830
Mister! Mister! Mis...

254
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:04,147
Help me!... Mister!

255
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,580
Mister...

256
00:29:21,414 --> 00:29:24,130
You motherfucker... Can't you evendeal with an old timer?!

257
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,580
What was it? Boxing, Jeet Kune Do or Karate? What?

258
00:29:28,764 --> 00:29:31,621
Hey boss! You should have seen him yourself!

259
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,179
He was so quick. I couldn'teven see his hand move.

260
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,088
Hey, wasn't he some...

261
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:38,818
Forget it... Fuck!

262
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:44,666
Alright! Fine. I needed someone to take the fall anyway.

263
00:29:44,677 --> 00:29:46,410
He didn't flinch...

264
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:47,781
What?

265
00:29:49,057 --> 00:29:51,428
He didn't flinch when I shot the gun.

266
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:55,276
So what!

267
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:07,680
So your neighbour mother and daughter was kidnapped and it's a drug related. right?

268
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:08,780
Yes.

269
00:30:08,915 --> 00:30:10,935
Is she really your neighbour?

270
00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:14,799
Nevermind. State your address andwe'll have a nearest precinct contact you.

271
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,738
Hello?...

272
00:30:18,072 --> 00:30:19,062
Your address sir?...

273
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:25,728
Hey mister, if you're lonely, why don't you call 114 instead?

274
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:30,443
Girls have way sexier voices. Why bother us late at night...

275
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,846
I'll do whatever you want me to do. Just don't hurt them.

276
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,680
Wise of you. All youneed to do is just run an errand.

277
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:00,776
~ 11/19, 6:13 A. M. ~

278
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:23,005
How's he?- Not bad.

279
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,080
Open the glove compartment.

280
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,760
(Out of order)

281
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,176
Go to Dalak Golf driving range and ask for Mr. Oh.

282
00:32:29,187 --> 00:32:32,628
Hand over the package at 6 sharp. Be punctual.

283
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:34,882
Hang up and ditch the phone.

284
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,985
When are you letting them go?

285
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,260
There's a famous dumpling soup restaurant. Bet you haven't been there?

286
00:32:43,468 --> 00:32:46,630
Table for three at 9 o'clock. Go and look it up.

287
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:30,221
Hey, auntie. How come the dishes don't change and still taste so bad.

288
00:33:30,232 --> 00:33:31,280
Fuck you

289
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,460
Fuck me.

290
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,410
Narcotics! Rho speaking

291
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,330
What?

292
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,912
Chinese: ~ Meet you...- Very happy to see you...

293
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:21,865
Welcome. This way please.

294
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,980
Please.

295
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,080
Chinese:~ Please be seated...- Wait, wait, wait!

296
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,933
(Chinese~ Happy to meet you.)

297
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,826
Am I correct ? Yes sir.

298
00:34:33,837 --> 00:34:35,930
Seat...- (Chinese~ Please be seated.)

299
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,365
Was he alone? Yes, sir.

300
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,670
These continent guys are fearless, uh?

301
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,680
What are you waiting for?

302
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,235
Tell him I've brought it from Shen Yang, China.

303
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:01,625
Tell him that.- Yes sir.

304
00:35:02,762 --> 00:35:06,480
(Chinese: ~ This tea is from Shen Yang, China. Please try it)

305
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,321
Try!- (Chinese:~ Try some... )

306
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,604
He must have watched too much gangster movies.

307
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,786
All dressed up in black... Is he attending a funeral?

308
00:35:17,798 --> 00:35:19,350
Shall I translate that?

309
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,158
You don't want to live?

310
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:26,661
Son of a bitch... afraid I might've poisoned it. Want me to drink it first, fine?

311
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,180
Are you Mr. Oh Myung Kyu?

312
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,630
I kept my part of bargain.

313
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:40,980
Let them go.

314
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,880
What's this?

315
00:35:43,923 --> 00:35:45,269
What the hell is this?!

316
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,680
I did exactly as I was told.

317
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:48,680
Keep your promise.

318
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,680
What the hell is he talking about?

319
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,568
Did you receive it?

320
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,680
Man Suk?

321
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,080
Are you trying to fuck me?

322
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:20,760
Should I just sit and watchthe business go down your throat?

323
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,770
You think you'd get away with this?!

324
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,330
Mr. Oh... Born in '58, year of the dog, Oh Myung Kyu, motherfucker.

325
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,180
Let me tell you this.

326
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:35,055
No matter how well you lick the assholesof prosecutors and judges,

327
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:37,057
You have 20 rounds with your name on it. Get it? Motherfucker?

328
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:42,290
If you value your life, you better start running, you stinking mongrel, motherfucker!

329
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,780
Stinking mongrel!

330
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,816
You! Chinese literature Major.

331
00:36:55,585 --> 00:36:56,910
You've just blown your part-time job payment.

332
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,330
Bastard!

333
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,855
Hold him up!

334
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,594
Fuck! What a mess...

335
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:13,955
God damn...!

336
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,230
Stop!

337
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,619
Give him to the cops.

338
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,775
Quickly... This way!

339
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,321
We need to get in! Out of the way!- God damn motherfucker!

340
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:48,405
Motherfuckers!!

341
00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:52,874
Out of the way! Fuckers!

342
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,487
There's Oh! Over there!

343
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,140
What the fuck!

344
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:39,980
Fuck!

345
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,090
Get him...

346
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,965
Lee Gwang Su.

347
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,580
Joo Dae Young

348
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,880
Kim Bo Sung

349
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,135
Whoever drops it, gets his ass kicked!

350
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,112
Anyone caught adding water to his piss, will regret it. Understood?

351
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,980
Son of bitches. Not even a single respond.- Got it.

352
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,280
No talking!

353
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,433
Don't swap your piss!

354
00:40:44,147 --> 00:40:45,780
You've all heard it clearly. Understood?!

355
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,461
No organs?- Yes!

356
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,118
Cornea, kidney, liver, heart, subcutaneous tissues...

357
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:53,918
whatever that can be sold at high priceshave been completely taken out and emptied.

358
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:56,330
Organ harvesting is not Oh Myung Jyu's style...

359
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,496
Who the hell is he?

360
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,022
He popped out from nowhere.

361
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:06,246
We're checking his identity but so far nolinks with Oh Myung Kyu.

362
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,570
This was hidden inside the boiler.

363
00:41:16,365 --> 00:41:17,270
Too little.

364
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,030
Already gone.

365
00:41:20,254 --> 00:41:20,730
Yeah?

366
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:25,480
Name: Cha Tae Shik, Address: 21 Dongja-dong, Yong San-ku, Seoul

367
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:27,855
No drug charges. And negative on dope test.

368
00:41:29,185 --> 00:41:33,853
Right! And this guy has norecords between '98 and '06...

369
00:41:33,864 --> 00:41:34,720
No record?

370
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,975
Citizen registration cancellation is nothing new.

371
00:41:38,186 --> 00:41:40,750
Start from last known record. Find the connection with Oh Myung Kyu.

372
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:43,308
Remember, it's a homicide.

373
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,345
21 Dong Ja-dong, Yong San-ku

374
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,080
Pawn shop?

375
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,300
A splotch was found inside this woman's nose

376
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,267
Understand what that means?

377
00:42:10,808 --> 00:42:13,360
Her eyeballs were extractedwhile her heart was still beating.

378
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,625
She was alive when her eyeballs were gorged out, god damn it!

379
00:42:16,636 --> 00:42:17,626
Understand!

380
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,080
Drug charges is not an issue here...

381
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,635
If you keep insisting on taking the fifth, you will rot in prison for good. Understand?

382
00:42:25,646 --> 00:42:26,636
Do you...?!

383
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,715
Detective...

384
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,796
Don't we get night snacks?

385
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,596
What? Night snack?

386
00:42:33,607 --> 00:42:35,558
Don't you fucking get it?

387
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,415
Who's Cha Tae Shik?

388
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:40,680
What is it?

389
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,891
I couldn't access his record. It was locked.

390
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,105
Locked?

391
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,526
Hey! This is the phone records betweenOh Myung Kyu and his associates.

392
00:42:46,537 --> 00:42:49,141
Pass it to the captain and tell him to see me after he reads it.

393
00:42:49,147 --> 00:42:51,214
He's still at the site andprobably won't be back anytime soon.

394
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,620
Damn..

395
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,382
Alright! Let's continue after meals?

396
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:12,139
Look...

397
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,080
I'm left-handed.

398
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,118
Alright! Hunger finally got to you, eh?

399
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:19,432
Now you'll talk, thank god!

400
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:21,015
That's the attitude!

401
00:43:21,026 --> 00:43:25,096
Let's finish this quickly after eating, Okay?

402
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,540
Hello?

403
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,381
Who is this? Who the hell are you?

404
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:10,610
I'm the part time job student at the scene...

405
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,070
All I did was ask for a meal...

406
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,450
Where's detective Park?

407
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,975
Put detective Park on!

408
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,880
Please save me!

409
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,380
Young man.

410
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,980
Can you read the license plate over there?

411
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:38,680
What?

412
00:44:39,266 --> 00:44:42,247
Help to see if it's my son's van. I can hardly see it.

413
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,080
What's the number.- 5124...

414
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,930
Yeah. It's 5124 alright!

415
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,940
Let's go to see your mom.

416
00:46:14,407 --> 00:46:16,237
Come on up.

417
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,130
Mom's up there?

418
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,230
You don't come up, you don't see your mom.

419
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,093
Open up, please

420
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:37,740
Grandma, please let me out.

421
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,180
Open up please.

422
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,080
41 minutes.

423
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:37,980
43 minutes

424
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:44,470
45 minutes 18 seconds.

425
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:46,398
Jun Ho got all his whole teeth broken.

426
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:49,843
Detective Kwon's knee joint got busted.

427
00:47:49,854 --> 00:47:53,610
This man seems to be very mysteriousand well versed in close combat.

428
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,981
This bastard is fucking complicated.

429
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,440
The blocked code of lock on Cha Tae Shik'sbackground record was 011.

430
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:00,600
Guess what?

431
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,680
Military Intelligence...

432
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:06,680
Unless it's a political figure. I've never seenany civilian having his record locked.

433
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,680
It's fucking curious...

434
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,180
There's a way to break the lock, you know.

435
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,680
Wanna try?

436
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,133
Remember the short track Ono case?

437
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:21,854
An elementary school kid sent an email tothe president of U. S. A. stating inside...

438
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,890
I Kill You!...

439
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:27,600
Alarmed, the FBI requested a police investigation.

440
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:31,305
Naturally, guys with skeletons in theircloset will start to get nervous.

441
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,833
We'll use exactly the same tactic andsend a email in name of Cha Tae Shik.

442
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:37,275
If they request for our investigation...

443
00:48:37,968 --> 00:48:41,059
Well, National Intelligence Service wouldn'thave any option but to declassify the information.

444
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,530
Obama... Obama?

445
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,496
Is Obama your friend, idiot?

446
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,446
We are just sending it to the white house.

447
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,559
Alright now... Go?

448
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:58,705
Stop?

449
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,380
Whatever it takes.

450
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,357
Don't kill me.

451
00:49:11,368 --> 00:49:13,581
Don't kill me please.

452
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:18,095
That bitch... The fucking whore talked me into it...

453
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:20,420
That's how it got started...

454
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,630
Korean bastards only act when they are confronted...

455
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:26,880
It took the Olympics to have them build bridges and stadiums.

456
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,268
How could it possibly not collapse?

457
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:37,855
Oh... I just wanted to have some fun with the bitch. Nobody is behind this...

458
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,030
Son of a bitch.

459
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,679
Then where the fuck does the pawnshop guy fit in?

460
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,475
He's with you, isn't he?

461
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,250
What pawnshop?

462
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,640
Count to three.

463
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,355
I cut your dick off and squeeze your balls out. One.

464
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,780
P... p... please forgive me...

465
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:59,113
Two.

466
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:03,328
Please, please don't kill me. Please forgive me. Let me live, please. No... No.

467
00:50:03,339 --> 00:50:04,329
Three!

468
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,980
You just frightened the shit outta me, god damn it!

469
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,231
Why the fuck waste time?

470
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:21,670
Dinner's here. Eat!

471
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:28,610
Would you please drop me a hint when you act, for god sake!

472
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,797
I just can't figure out where the pawn shop guy fits in?

473
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,915
Think about it. Why would he listen to usand not talk to the police?

474
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:37,580
Drop it... It doesn't matter. It's now our turf.

475
00:50:37,591 --> 00:50:39,660
What about Oh?- He was sent to Namnang.

476
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:41,780
Alone?

477
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:47,035
It's a fucking brand new Dolceand Gabbana, for god sake. Damn it!

478
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,330
Alone again?

479
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,895
Yes.- I said don't let him act alone

480
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,595
That pervert just likes to play alone.

481
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,528
Let me live, please? This once, please let me live.

482
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,552
I'll pay you more thanMan Suk and Jong Suk. Alright?

483
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,280
Alright? Please spare me this once.

484
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,585
If we refine the philophon melt inside this,

485
00:51:16,596 --> 00:51:20,835
We'll live like kings for the rest of our lives. Alright?

486
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:40,176
I got it! I finally figure it out!

487
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:44,210
The daughter of the killed woman. She was running errands for Cha Tae Shik.

488
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:45,930
The girl was here often.

489
00:51:45,941 --> 00:51:48,299
I don't think there's any relationship betweenthe Park Hae Jung and Cha Tae Shik

490
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:51,414
Having the kid as a drug runner. Don't you think it fits?

491
00:51:51,995 --> 00:51:53,622
Doesn't it sounds right? I've got it right?

492
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,390
So he cut up the womanhe was having a relationship with...

493
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:57,931
and pulled her eyeballs out?

494
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,206
Think Cha Tae Shik did all that?

495
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,480
No?

496
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:05,012
That girl called Somee. Any leads on her whereabouts?

497
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:08,732
Who cares? We're neck deep in Oh Myung Kyu's case.

498
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:14,865
It's up.

499
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,480
Cha Tae Shik.

500
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,330
Forget bout fucking mike. damn it. You see a big audience?

501
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,461
Yes, sir.

502
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:30,480

508
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,480
You two are sure about this information? Make sure you got the information verified.

509
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:53,200
This man looks like a delliquent...

That was sold from here, wasn't it?

515
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,350
I'm afraid you misunderstood.

516
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:11,296
This is a loan office, not a telecommunication service.

517
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:14,696
Give me the name of the guy and you won't get hurt.

518
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,119
Who are you?

519
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,480
A cop?

520
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,046
Agency training have always been kept secret to the outside.

521
00:53:24,057 --> 00:53:31,160
Known to be extremely brutal even by just watching the drills... That's all we have on the organization...

522
00:53:56,622 --> 00:53:58,326
This guy usually buys about 20 phones at a time...

Gunshot wound?

527
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:15,904
Unlike the other victims in the car, Cha Tae Shik was transferred to a military hospital.

528
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,307
According to the military doctor who performed surgery on him...

529
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:20,589
the wound he had was not vehicular.

530
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,780
Who the fuck are we dealing with?

531
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,959

536
00:54:42,987 --> 00:54:47,410
Listen! We're not on the internet buying shoes. Let's meet up.

537
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:48,957
Right.

538
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:57,320
You can't prolong your life, just swallowing some pills...

539
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,460
Right.

540
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:02,225
Let's discuss this laterwith all the information, alright?

541
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:03,226
Right!...

542
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,980
Hold it, love. That's not the way to light a cigarette.

543
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:37,380
Ever heard the sound of this, sweetheart?

544
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,430
Here, bottom's up.

545
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,430
C'mon! Cheers!

546
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:50,680
You mean it? After this man isfound, we're even, right?

547
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,565
Just let me know where he is.

548
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:55,939
Right.

549
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:03,041
Yes, yes. Right! He took the car and crossedYang Hwa bridge a few minutes ago.

550
00:56:03,052 --> 00:56:08,441
Tochi's cell was traced to that area. Be careful!

551
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,410
Good evening, sir!- Evening.

552
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:48,760
First time here?

553
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,130
Chicks are hot here, you know.

554
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:56,905
This place is about as risque as it can gets.

555
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,740
Though tonight seems slow...

556
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,460
although I've scored on numerous hotties here..

557
00:57:10,115 --> 00:57:14,602
What's with this place today? I suggest we change venue.

558
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:17,130
Let's change...

559
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:24,055
Where's Tochi?

560
00:57:27,273 --> 00:57:28,962
Boss! He's here.

561
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,079
Boss! He's here!

562
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,251
I got it, I got it. Damn it.

563
00:57:41,786 --> 00:57:44,081
Chronic constipation.

564
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,980
This way, please.

565
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:55,499
Dialysis.

566
00:57:56,253 --> 00:57:58,947
Once begun going to a convenientstore across can be quite a labour.

567
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:01,480
Since you're looking for a kidney for your wife, I'll give you a special deal cheap.

568
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:03,559
Religion?- What... Religion?

569
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:06,271
Make it look like a voluntary donation within a religious organization.

570
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:10,010
As part of the laundry process. This takes about two months...

571
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,770
Are you having a fever?

572
00:58:11,785 --> 00:58:12,529
You are sweating like hell.

573
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,080
No, I'm fine.

574
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:19,780
Hello?

575
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:24,740
Yes. I am... in the men's room

576
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:28,820
Yes... Yes.

577
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,065
Who was it?

578
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:34,923
It's a... friend... of mine..- Friend who?

579
00:58:35,965 --> 00:58:37,118
The toilet's out! Get out!

580
00:58:38,462 --> 00:58:39,990
I said! Get out of here!

581
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,105
Mister, here! Here.

582
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,938
Fucking son of a bitch.

583
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,870
I'll not ask twice.

584
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:09,960
Where is Somee?

585
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,780
Fuck you...

586
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:28,560
You sold Somee to that ant tunnel?

587
00:59:28,571 --> 00:59:33,141
I know nothing about Man Suk and Jong Suk.

588
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:34,380
Where are they?

589
00:59:38,935 --> 00:59:40,185
I know!

590
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,662
I know...!
