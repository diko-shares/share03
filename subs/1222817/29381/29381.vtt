1
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,260
Twenty questions. Go.

2
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,460
You're a man. Are you in politics?

3
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,060
Warm beer. Tastes like piss.

4
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,460
It's your turn, babe.

5
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,380
Dead or alive?

6
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,660
Don't you think that's
a really stupid question these days?

7
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,300
You know, he's kind of an asshole,

8
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,100
but if you need me
to take care of him, I will.

9
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,140
I can hear you.

10
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,780
He's the one in the family
with all the brains.

11
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,300
Is that right?

12
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,740
All right, the interstate's coming up.
What do we do?

13
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,100
Don't get on it. Stay on this back road.

14
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,580
How come every time you say that,

15
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,500
we end up in a three-hour scenic tour
in the middle of nowhere?

16
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,060
Look, we agreed on the rules, didn't we?

17
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,140
And by taking it, we're breaking what?

18
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,700
The rule that says
we shouldn't take the interstate.

19
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,780
"I guess we wouldn't want
to break any rules," he said,

20
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,180
drinking his beer
as he drove the stolen Mercedes

21
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,780
ridiculously over the speed limit,
and, look, no hands!

22
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,540
- Babe, don't!
- Stop!

23
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,180
- Stop it, you moron!
- Don't!

24
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,940
- All right, smartass, I'll read the map.
- Can you? It has actual writing on it.

25
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,220
Very funny.

26
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,740
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

27
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,340
Hey, guys.

28
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,420
All right, windows, everybody.

29
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,740
What the hell is this guy doing?

30
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,380
My daughter and I, we ran out of gas.

31
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,100
All right, sir,
please move your car out of the road.

32
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,340
We left Denver yesterday morning.
Last gas we got was Colorado Springs.

33
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,420
I'm sorry, we can't help you.
Now move your car!

34
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,980
Look, all we need
is just a little bit of gas.

35
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,620
Yeah, I'm sure you do.
You and everybody else.

36
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,340
Stay where you are!

37
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,380
We can trade you for it.
We got food and water.

38
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,340
- Brian, we have more than enough.
- More than... How do you know that?

39
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,500
- I said do not get any closer!
- Brian, he looks clean.

40
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,500
Or he could be incubating.
Think about it for a second...

41
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,540
Guys! She's got it.

42
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,060
Shit!

43
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,580
Come on, come on, come on...

44
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,860
They'll die out there.

45
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,260
Everyone dies.

46
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,380
<i>The rules are simple.
At least, that's how my brother sees it.</i>

47
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,540
<i>One, avoid the infected at all costs.</i>

48
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,340
<i>Their breath is highly contagious.</i>

49
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,980
<i>Two, disinfect anything they've touched
in the last 24 hours.</i>

50
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,780
<i>Three, the sick are already dead.
They can't be saved.</i>

51
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,500
<i>You break the rules, you die.</i>

52
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,780
<i>You follow them, you live.</i>

53
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,900
<i>Maybe.</i>

54
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,220
Hey. Look what I found.

55
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,620
Great.

56
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,780
Hey, if you happen to find a brand-new
factory-issued oil pan, holler.

57
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,140
- Are you sure you can't fix it?
- It's blown, lvy Boy.

58
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,340
- Brian.
- What?

59
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,500
All that car needed was gas.

60
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,660
Wait, what? No. No, no, no way.

61
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,500
- Lf we sit here, we're just gonna die.
- We won't if we go back?

62
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,860
You saw the girl.
You saw the blood, the rashes.

63
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,900
Bobby, come on, you saw her.

64
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,140
- Am I the only one here?
- Kate, we do not have a lot of options...

65
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,420
They're your rules!

66
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,540
Danny, tell your girlfriend
to get her shit together.

67
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,700
- I'm not his girlfriend.
- She's not my girlfriend.

68
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,700
All right, then tell me, tell me.
Why the hell is she here?

69
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,860
Why didn't we let her sit tight
in her McMansion,

70
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,260
- waiting for the looters?
- Okay.

71
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,380
Could we just calm down and try
and think this thing through? Please.

72
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,940
- Yeah.
- So what about the car?

73
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,700
I don't know, Danny. I'm trying to think.

74
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,340
- Well, we need that car...
- I know that!

75
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,180
Shit!

76
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,860
All right, put your masks on, guys.

77
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,140
Frank Holloway.

78
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,860
We're gonna need your car.

79
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,940
Yeah, I figured as much.

80
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,940
Do you really want to splatter
your brand-new vehicle

81
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,220
with the insides of someone who,
for all you know, may be infected?

82
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,980
We got loads of Clorox.

83
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,020
- Cleanup is not my chief concern.
- Brian, that's all right.

84
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,260
- That's close enough.
- I picked up a radio transmission

85
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,220
from a school outside of Farmington
last week.

86
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,580
People from all over the state
are traveling there.

87
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,860
For what?

88
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,860
The CDC, they set up some kind
of emergency response center.

89
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,820
They've got a new serum.

90
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,980
That's one hell of a story, man.
I don't think I've heard that one yet.

91
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,140
Are they getting results?

92
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,020
No, they're not getting any results, Kate.

93
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,980
They've got a new treatment, and I am
taking my daughter there in this car.

94
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,140
Now, if you're onboard with that, great.
If not...

95
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,060
This is a fairytale, and he knows it.

96
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,620
It's the Baltimore vaccine all over again.

97
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,220
It's a bunch of retrovirals
that don't work for shit.

98
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,980
So go ahead, Brian.
Shoot him in the head.

99
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,500
Wait! Hey.

100
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,500
I got an idea.

101
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,580
Hey.

102
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,580
Want to know a secret? About boys?

103
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,380
Their bark is worse than their bite.

104
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,660
- You know what I mean?
- No.

105
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,340
- It's okay.
- Don't listen to her, kiddo.

106
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,540
- Trust me, she loves it when I bite.
- Why don't you eat me, Brian?

107
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,420
- I think we can arrange that.
- Jesus, Brian! She's, like, eight.

108
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,140
Yeah, well, mentally, so is he.

109
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,060
<i>Adi√≥s, Road Warrior.
You crap piece of shit.</i>

110
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,020
<i>But Godless governments have fallen,</i>

111
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,220
<i>and the armies of man
have perished by his hand...</i>

112
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,620
Pattycake, pattycake...

113
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,620
<i>... for this pandemic is the flail of God
and the world his threshing floor,</i>

114
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,620
<i>and, implacably,
he will thresh out his harvest</i>

115
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,060
<i>until the wheat is separated from
the chaff, the righteous from the sinner.</i>

116
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,620
<i>And make no mistake about it,
there shall be far more chaff than wheat.</i>

117
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,420
<i>Few chosen...</i>

118
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,060
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen much weed around lately.

119
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,260
- Very funny.
- What?

120
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,740
Just show some respect.

121
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,500
For what?
That God's punishing my daughter?

122
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,620
Who's he rewarding? Who, you?

123
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,940
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?

124
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,060
Some people locked themselves away,
piled up food,

125
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,300
didn't even pick up the phone.
They were dead in a week.

126
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,340
Me, I worked at the stadium,
digging those mass graves for 400...

127
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,980
- 400 bucks a day!
- That's exactly right.

128
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,020
You can laugh all you want,
but I was up to my knees in that shit,

129
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,220
and here I am.

130
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,740
So you're immune or chosen
or something?

131
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,420
I'm here and they're not.

132
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,860
So, then, I guess you won't mind
kissing my daughter good night for me,

133
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,260
huh, Brian?

134
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,020
I didn't think so.

135
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,660
So much for being chosen, huh?

136
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,180
That's hysterical, huh, lvy League?

137
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,700
Where'd you go to school, Danny?

138
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,500
- He got a scholarship to go to Harvard.
- Yale.

139
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,540
- It was Yale, actually.
- It doesn't really matter, does it?

140
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,580
A little something shut the place down
before freshman orientation.

141
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,580
- Watch it, Brian.
- How's that for a knee-slapper?

142
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,740
- Why do you have to be such a dick?
- Come on!

143
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,540
Watch out! Watch out!

144
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,020
You! You stay in the back, you hear me?

145
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,740
Hey, I will if you keep your eyes
on the goddamn road!

146
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,380
Hey, you can get out anytime!
You can get out right now!

147
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,940
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Kate! Kate!

148
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,940
The tape held.
You don't have to worry about it.

149
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,580
Are you okay? What is it?

150
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,860
Damn it.
I think she knocked a filling loose.

151
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,380
I weep for you.

152
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,580
It's locked.

153
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,660
Danny, be careful.

154
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,100
It's okay.

155
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,060
Shit.

156
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,700
Hey, are you all right? Danny!

157
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,860
What happened?

158
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,100
Jesus!

159
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,340
Just get the gas and let's go.

160
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,900
Hey, kids, we'll be back in 20.

161
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,020
Yeah, we'll be back in more like five.

162
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,340
Shit.

163
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,100
Bobby! Baby?

164
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,100
- What's that?
- That?

165
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,420
Well, Brian and I,

166
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,620
we had a dad, too.
He was just like yours.

167
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,620
And every summer, when we were little,
he would take us to this place.

168
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,300
It's Turtle Beach.

169
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,860
And we could swim and surf,
and we'd fish

170
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,740
<i>and eat these soft-shell crab
sandwiches that were soaked in mayo.</i>

171
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,180
Were there lots of turtles?

172
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,140
Lots? God, there were thousands
of them! They were everywhere.

173
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,620
<i>I mean, you could barely put your foot
in the water without stepping on one.</i>

174
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,860
Sometimes they'd be stacked up
on top of each other.

175
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,180
- That's impossible!
- It is possible.

176
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,900
- They were everywhere.
- Can we go to Turtle Beach with them?

177
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,700
Time to sleep.

178
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,420
What makes you think
you're gonna be safe there?

179
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,540
It's an old motel.

180
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,460
The place has been abandoned
for years. We'll go on scavenging trips

181
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,860
and quarantine ourselves
every single time we get back,

182
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,780
- and wait.
- Until they come for us.

183
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,620
Until... Until the disease dies off.

184
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,660
The disease or the people?

185
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,180
It's the same thing, really.

186
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,900
<i>Bobby, I love you,</i>

187
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,180
and you know
what a dipshit I can be sometimes...

188
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,300
What's the big deal?

189
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,660
I think we should see other people.

190
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,020
If that's the way you feel.

191
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,700
It is the way I feel.

192
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,140
- You can be such a dipshit sometimes.
- I know!

193
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,700
Probably the biggest in the world
at this point.

194
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,700
Do you ever think of Yale?

195
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,540
Yeah. Sure.

196
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,460
That, and all those things
you think you'll get to do someday.

197
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,220
Jesus!

198
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,220
- Put it out! Put the fire out!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

199
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,620
Where do you think you're going, boy?

200
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,340
- Hurry up.
- Hurry.

201
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,180
Just keep it down. Keep it down.
Put it out.

202
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,780
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Daddy.

203
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,620
Honey, I'm just going in there

204
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,260
to make sure
there are no monsters under the bed.

205
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,940
If there are monsters, you shouldn't go.

206
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,540
Okay, now listen to me.
There's no reason to worry. All right?

207
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,220
I'll be back before you can say
Captain Feathersword.

208
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,020
Captain Feathersword.

209
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,300
You're too smart for me, you know that?

210
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,020
I'll stay with her.

211
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,340
Bobby.

212
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,940
Look, now is not the time, okay?

213
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,060
The girls need some alone time
to talk about boys.

214
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,820
I am serious.
Do not get too close to her.

215
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,260
I'm serious. Just go. It's gonna be fine.

216
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,420
You know, you are always doing
whatever the hell you want.

217
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,340
That's why you love me!

218
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,780
Hello?

219
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,660
Hello?

220
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,500
Looks like your hospital
ran out of patients, Frank.

221
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,220
Come on. Let's get out of here.

222
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,380
Where's Kate?

223
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,580
- What is she doing?
- Kate?

224
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,020
- We have to go. There's nothing here.
- You don't know that.

225
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,820
Kate, they failed. Let's go.

226
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,660
There's a whole wing
we haven't checked yet.

227
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,180
You see? There are people here.

228
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,860
Wait!

229
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,740
No way.

230
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,060
Oh, my God. They did it.

231
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,180
- Sir. Sir!
- Yes?

232
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,900
- Are you in charge here?
- No, you want Dr. Lindus.

233
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,380
His office is on the second floor
of the old math building.

234
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,500
But you won't find him there.
He died on Thursday.

235
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,140
Doctor, we've come all the way
from Colorado.

236
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,380
We heard that you had a serum here.

237
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,060
It's my daughter, she's...
My daughter is very sick.

238
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,180
- How long?
- A little over a week.

239
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,740
- Is she bleeding from her ears yet?
- No.

240
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,380
Well, bring her in.

241
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,700
Okay, kids, these nice people
are gonna take you to your parents,

242
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,340
who are all waiting outside.

243
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,540
So, as soon as we finish our medicine,
we'll all be right as rain.

244
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,540
What are you doing to these kids?
What's that? Where's the serum?

245
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,820
The serum? Yes, we had a serum.

246
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,820
For three days it stabilized the patients.
A few actually improved.

247
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,100
Three days.
That's the best that we could do,

248
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,660
or anyone else in the world
as far as I know.

249
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,780
Staved off the virus for three days.

250
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,500
Prolonged sickness and pain
for 72 hours.

251
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,140
Well, I'm not prolonging it anymore.

252
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,540
- What's in the punch?
- Potassium.

253
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,620
Lots and lots of potassium.

254
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,100
Now, if you'll excuse us.

255
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,060
No! No, stop! You can't do this!

256
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,620
Kate, they're sick. They're already dead.
Let's go.

257
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,780
- Brian, they are kids.
- Who's dead? My daughter's alive!

258
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,940
She's not dead!

259
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,860
- There are other places...
- Stop pulling the goddamn curtain!

260
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,060
Please! Please.

261
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,900
- Give me your gun.
- Frank, stay where you are!

262
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,540
- Give me your gun, Brian.
- Frank, you know I can't do that.

263
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,140
Give me the gun!

264
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,980
Danny!

265
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,260
Stop. Stop! Stop, goddamn you!
Stop it! Now!

266
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,620
Put that down.

267
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,060
- Put it down!
- Look around you.

268
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,940
We lost power two weeks ago.

269
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,540
We sucked the town dry of gas
just to run the generators.

270
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,340
There's nothing left.

271
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,540
Don't. Please don't.

272
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,140
Sometimes choosing life is just
choosing a more painful form of death.

273
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,340
You're telling me your favorite cartoon's
name is Mop-Face Circle-Shirt?

274
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,940
- No!
- Brush-Bill Soup-Jeans?

275
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,900
No! SpongeBob SquarePants!

276
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,340
Spoon-Lips Boxer-Shorts!

277
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,980
Frank! Frank!

278
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,100
Okay. You're gonna be okay, just...

279
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,100
Okay, listen. Breathe slow.

280
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,540
Okay, okay.

281
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,380
We're getting out of here.

282
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,300
What happened?

283
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:27,060
Nothing. She took it off.
She had problems breathing, I think.

284
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,820
- Come here.
- Daddy? I have to go.

285
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,380
- Number one or number two?
- Number two.

286
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,060
Can you hold it?

287
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,500
Well, how about if I get you, like, a potty
or something, can you do it here then?

288
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,020
No.

289
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,100
All right, now. I need you to be
a very big girl for me right now.

290
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,220
Okay? I need you to be really brave.

291
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,460
You see those little blue huts
over there?

292
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,740
I need you to go over there by yourself,

293
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,660
and I'll be waiting
right here for you, okay?

294
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,180
- Can you try that for me?
- Okay.

295
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,620
- Good girl. You ready?
- Ready.

296
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,980
Come on.

297
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,140
I'll be waiting right here for you, okay?

298
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,420
- Okay, honey. It's okay.
- Daddy.

299
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,460
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

300
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,380
You did great. I'm very proud of you.
Now Daddy will take you, okay?

301
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,580
You strike me as a good man, Daniel.

302
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,020
We'll be back in a minute.
Come on, honey.

303
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,940
Get in.

304
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,980
- Get... Get in the car!
- We can't leave them here. Not here.

305
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,740
Look, we brought them here.
That was the deal.

306
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,460
Now, it's time to drop the fairytales
and move on.

307
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,660
You heard what that doctor said.
There's nothing here. There's nothing!

308
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,420
You already put us in danger
once back there.

309
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,460
Bobby? Bobby, say something.

310
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,060
Hey, what was that song... What was
that song Miss Stevens taught you

311
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,820
<i>- that you used to sing all the time?
- Itsy Bitsy Spider.</i>

312
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
<i>The ltsy Bitsy Spider, yeah.
Do you remember how to sing that?</i>

313
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:20,140
<i>Ltsy bitsy spider went up the waterspout</i>

314
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,820
<i>Down came the rain
and washed the spider out</i>

315
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,660
<i>Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain</i>

316
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,740
<i>And the itsy bitsy spider
went up the spout again</i>

317
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,980
How long till the beach, Danny?

318
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,220
At least two days. Why?

319
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,060
Anyone for 18 holes?

320
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,580
If we're gonna stop somewhere
for the night, might as well be high-end.

321
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,780
Right?

322
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,900
- What do you say, Bobby?
- Do whatever you want, Brian.

323
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,620
Hello!

324
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,780
Hello!

325
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,900
The service here is for shit.

326
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
Hey.

327
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,940
Hey.

328
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,820
- You all right?
- Yeah.

329
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,860
Hey.

330
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,500
Look, what happened back there...

331
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,020
I'm just trying
to get us to the beach alive.

332
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,900
- You know that, right?
- Yeah, I know.

333
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,580
We all agreed on the rules.

334
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,420
And the sick, they're dead.
There's nothing we can do for them.

335
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,580
Right.

336
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,020
- All right, I should go check the back.
- Okay.

337
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,220
Okay. Knock it off, stupid, you're fine.

338
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,220
Hey, Danny! I found the pool!

339
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,380
You want to play Marco Polo?

340
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,980
- Shit!
- Help!

341
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,780
Help!

342
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,820
Oh, Jesus Christ! Danny!

343
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,220
Let's play some golf.

344
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,940
Jesus! Yeah!

345
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,100
Hey, are you okay?

346
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,780
I thought golf was for old people.

347
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,740
- Fuck.
- Jerk!

348
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,620
Come on down here, baby.

349
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,260
- What?
- Help me out of here.

350
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,460
Come on, it'll be just like the time
we broke into Forest Oaks.

351
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,220
Remember how the groundskeeper
booted us out?

352
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,340
Yeah.

353
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,220
Well, this time we're members.
They can't touch us.

354
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,260
It's nice and soft.

355
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,300
Just come out of there. Come on.

356
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,340
Just give me a hand.

357
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,860
- Come over here! Get over here!
- Brian! Stop it!

358
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,140
Come on! Don't!

359
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,740
What?

360
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,220
- I'm gonna get all dirty!
- It's sand!

361
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,740
Yeah, sand is dirt, asshole!

362
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,180
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

363
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,900
it's the 18th hole, and
young Brian Green steps up to the tee.

364
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,140
He needs a hole in one here
to get to the Masters,

365
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,340
but what he's really worried about
is people finding out that he's gay!

366
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,740
God damn it!

367
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,380
Dude, my advice to you
is put the club down, wait 10 minutes,

368
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,940
and just never pick it up again.

369
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,980
If it's so funny, show us what you got.

370
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,220
Thanks, but I think I'll use
an actual driver.

371
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,340
It's getting down to the wire, folks.

372
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,460
- Katie, Kate, whatever her last name...
- Shut up!

373
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,940
- All right!
- Nice.

374
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,100
Shit, the girl can swing!

375
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,460
Fairfield Country Club
Junior Champion three years in a row,

376
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,980
thank you very much.
Tiger Woods can kiss my ass.

377
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,020
Yeah!

378
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,580
Oh, shit.

379
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,220
Yeah!

380
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,500
<i>Larry?</i>

381
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,900
<i>Larry, come in.</i>

382
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,180
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

383
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,300
<i>If you're there, pick up.</i>

384
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,220
<i>We're coming back. Do you hear me?
We're coming back.</i>

385
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,780
What are you doing?

386
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,060
What the hell are you doing?

387
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,740
All day long, every single phone!
The phones are dead.

388
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,940
So, I just gotta try
and get in touch with my parents.

389
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,660
They're dead, too.

390
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,820
- You don't know that.
- I don't? Where were they?

391
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,020
Their cruise ship was quarantined
in Piraeus.

392
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,940
- Then they're dead.
- How do you know?

393
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,020
- You don't even know where Piraeus is!
- It doesn't matter where Piraeus is!

394
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,100
Everyone, everywhere, is dead,
your parents, my parents.

395
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,700
Soon you and I will be dead, too.

396
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,340
Kate, what happened?

397
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,660
- Leave me alone.
- Please.

398
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,100
What did she say to you?

399
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,180
Brian?

400
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,420
- That's not Brian.
- No.

401
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,220
<i>- Shit!
- We got them!</i>

402
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,940
<i>This way!</i>

403
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,820
<i>Up on the second floor!
It's a mess up here!</i>

404
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,740
Who are you,
and what the hell are you doing here?

405
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,140
Who are you?

406
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,660
Maybe we'll be able to talk
once we get rid of this.

407
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,420
No! Don't touch me!
Please, don't touch me!

408
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,100
We've been out a couple of days
scouting for supplies! We just got back!

409
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,460
<i>Let him go!</i>

410
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,700
<i>Now.</i>

411
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,860
<i>We got everybody?</i>

412
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,980
<i>- I think so.
- There's nobody else.</i>

413
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,060
<i>Tom!</i>

414
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,540
<i>- My space.
- What?</i>

415
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,780
<i>They breached it. It's not safe.</i>

416
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,780
<i>I can't... It's not safe!</i>

417
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,300
That's what you get
for living in a condom, man.

418
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,140
- You get...
- Screw you.

419
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,140
Hey, leave him alone!
We just wanted to spend the night here!

420
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,260
<i>You sons of bitches.
What have you done with Larry?</i>

421
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,860
How the hell do I know, man?

422
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,900
Maybe he got in a fight
with a shower curtain

423
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,900
like the rest of you guys.

424
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,940
<i>Larry. He was guarding the place.</i>

425
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,940
<i>They killed him.</i>

426
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,940
<i>- He was like that when we got here.
- Yeah, right.</i>

427
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,140
<i>You expect us to believe that?</i>

428
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,140
Why don't you go in the pool,

429
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,900
check out the cause of death
for yourself?

430
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,220
<i>- What, no volunteers?
- Shut up.</i>

431
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,620
<i>Tom, he must have been sick
when we left and didn't say anything.</i>

432
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,740
<i>That's impossible.
You know that's impossible.</i>

433
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,220
<i>The system is perfect.</i>

434
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,540
<i>- Why? Because you thought of it?
- He didn't seal up his suit properly.</i>

435
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,460
<i>He made a mistake.
He didn't follow procedure.</i>

436
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,180
Whatever gets you through the night.

437
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,900
<i>You know, I just met you
and I'm already sick of you.</i>

438
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,700
- I have that effect on people.
- Brian, cut it out! Jesus!

439
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,260
<i>I want all of you out of here. Now.</i>

440
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,020
Hey!

441
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,380
<i>- Please, we need that.
- So do we.</i>

442
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,420
<i>Get in.</i>

443
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,380
<i>- Not you.
- What? Danny.</i>

444
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,740
<i>What the hell are you doing?
Let the girl go.</i>

445
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,580
<i>- The girls stay.
- No!</i>

446
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,060
<i>- Yeah, they stay.
- Get your hands off me!</i>

447
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,420
<i>- Don't you touch her, you son of a bitch!
- Don't move!</i>

448
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,300
<i>Get back!</i>

449
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,180
<i>If we keep the girls,</i>

450
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,180
<i>what are you gonna do with the guys?
Kill them?</i>

451
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,420
<i>We're not that kind of people.</i>

452
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,700
<i>Yeah?</i>

453
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,820
<i>And what kind of people are we?
The kind that just sits and waits to die?</i>

454
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,860
Wait.

455
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:33,260
<i>Screw you, Tom! This isn't the mill.
You're not in charge anymore.</i>

456
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,860
<i>Let the girls go.</i>

457
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,740
<i>We have to check them out.
Make sure they're clean.</i>

458
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,940
<i>Right.</i>

459
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,300
<i>Strip.</i>

460
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,180
<i>- Please, no.
- I said strip!</i>

461
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,060
<i>Shit, shit, shit, shit!</i>

462
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,340
<i>- What's going on?
- Oh, my God! Back off! Back off!</i>

463
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,260
<i>- Somebody tell me what's going on!
- Stay away from her!</i>

464
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,820
<i>- What the hell is going on?
- I said go!</i>

465
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,380
<i>Shit!</i>

466
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:44,580
<i>Get the hell out of here right now!
I said, right now!</i>

467
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,180
This one's locked.

468
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,260
- I'm gonna look inside.
- I'll go check the back.

469
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,740
Danny?

470
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,100
Do you want to end up like them?

471
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,300
We will if she stays.

472
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,700
Talk to him.

473
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,220
- Brian?
- Help me out, will you?

474
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,500
We need to talk.

475
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,460
The key to the pump
has to be here somewhere.

476
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:32,140
- Brian, we need to deal with...
- Where the hell is that key?

477
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,780
Get in the car.

478
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,380
Get in.

479
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,220
Any luck?

480
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,660
Brian.

481
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,180
Get out.

482
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,700
I said get out.

483
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,100
- I'll get in the back.
- That's not what I said.

484
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,340
Brian, please let me stay.

485
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,380
Brian, please don't!

486
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,700
Brian, do not do this!

487
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,540
- There's a town down that road.
- These are just bruises.

488
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,020
I've been bouncing around
in the back of that

489
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,980
- stupid car for days.
- I'm sure there's plenty of water in town,

490
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,100
- but here's half a gallon.
- Of course I have bruises, but I am fine!

491
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,660
- Lf you ration it...
- I love you.

492
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,740
...it should last a few days.
- You love me, don't you?

493
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:51,140
- The same goes for the food.
- Brian, I'll wear a mask. I didn't know.

494
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,140
Like hell you didn't know!

495
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,340
- I...
- Don't you do that!

496
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,620
Don't you lie to me!

497
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,460
I wasn't sure.

498
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,860
Please don't leave me here!
Please, won't you help me?

499
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,860
When you get to town,
you find a comfortable place,

500
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,500
you know, with a good bed.

501
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,620
And get yourself a blanket,
even if it feels hot now.

502
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,380
And lots of water.

503
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,420
Do it before you're too weak.

504
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,780
Brian. Brian!

505
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,620
I warned you about the girl.

506
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,260
- You...
- I told you to stay away from her.

507
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,180
Why the hell
couldn't you have listened to me?

508
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,860
She was choking. She couldn't breathe.

509
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,340
- Brian.
- Hey, hand me a beer, will you?

510
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,780
Warm beer.

511
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,100
Tastes like piss.

512
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,980
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

513
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:07,220
- It's almost gone.
- I know that!

514
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,260
Car.

515
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,700
- I see it.
- We gotta make them stop.

516
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,980
Yeah, we'll just wave politely
and ask for help.

517
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,980
Brian. Brian!

518
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,300
Hey! I'll deal with this.

519
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,700
- Stay where you are!
- Don't come any closer!

520
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:50,900
I'm gonna stay right here.
We just need some gas.

521
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,820
- Sorry. We don't have any to spare.
- I know. I understand.

522
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,340
But I was just hoping
that maybe as a fellow Christian,

523
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,620
- you might be able to help us.
- Please don't do that.

524
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,700
You see, my wife in the car,
she's pregnant.

525
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,780
We're just looking for a cool place
to have the baby,

526
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,740
- see this thing through.
- Go in reverse. Let's go. Let's go.

527
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,180
Good luck.

528
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,260
- Go, go, go.
- Ma'am.

529
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,140
- No, I can't.
- Please.

530
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,740
I'm begging you!

531
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,780
No, Brian!

532
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,460
Get out!

533
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,700
Get out!

534
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,300
Get the gas.

535
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,300
Oh, God.

536
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,620
What are you doing?

537
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,340
They weren't gonna give it to us, Danny.

538
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,500
Help her out.

539
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:45,820
You don't talk to me. You hear me?
You don't tell me what to do!

540
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:50,860
Don't walk away from me,
you son of a bitch! I'm talking to you!

541
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,020
- What the...
- I am talking to you,

542
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,580
and I'm telling you what to do,
you self-righteous shit!

543
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,580
It must be nice sitting on the sidelines

544
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,540
while your dumb brother
wades in shit for you.

545
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,740
- No, I don't...
- Somebody had to do it.

546
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,420
- Was it gonna be you, Danny?
- You didn't have to...

547
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,060
You remember...
You remember our last day at home?

548
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:12,860
It wasn't you who went up to Mom
and Dad's room to get his gun, was it?

549
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,500
It wasn't you! It wasn't you
who had to go up there and lie

550
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,980
and tell them not to worry,
that you'd be back real soon.

551
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,540
- They were alive? Alive?
- You knew they were.

552
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,700
They were? You... You told me...

553
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:32,820
- What you wanted to hear.
- You asshole! Asshole!

554
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,740
Come here. Come here.
I'm an asshole for what?

555
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,380
Tell me, Danny, asshole for what?

556
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,660
For what?

557
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,900
For letting you walk by
with a clean conscience?

558
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,060
Well, that's what you like, Danny.

559
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,460
Remember Bobby?

560
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,460
You remember Bobby?

561
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,020
I was the one that had to drag her
out of the car

562
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,420
while you just sat there
watching me do it!

563
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,180
Bobby was right.

564
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,940
You got all the brains.

565
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:50,940
<i>Danny.</i>

566
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,260
Hey. Brian.

567
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,500
Stop here.

568
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,540
Brian. Brian.

569
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,340
We're gonna stop at this house, okay?

570
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:15,540
We're gonna find something
to dress your wound with.

571
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,460
Whatever you say, Doc.

572
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,460
Danny. There.

573
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,220
A little closer.

574
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,020
Keep going. Okay, stop.

575
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,620
Hello?

576
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:58,740
Hello!

577
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,420
If you can hear me,
we just need medical supplies.

578
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,540
Someone's hurt.

579
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,700
We're not infected,

580
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,300
and we don't mean you any harm.

581
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,540
We're...

582
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:28,420
We're just gonna take what we need,
and we'll leave.

583
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,460
What happened? Oh, shit!
What's on you?

584
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,820
It's not contagious. It's not human blood.

585
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,820
It's dog blood.

586
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:11,020
- You had me worried, little brother.
- I'm sorry.

587
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,460
Sorry.

588
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:25,140
Hey, don't take this the wrong way.
Can you pull down your pants?

589
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:56,420
Hey, so much for being chosen, huh?

590
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:02,300
I'm sorry.

591
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,420
He's got it, doesn't he?

592
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:41,100
Shit!

593
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:49,460
<i>I don't know if there's anybody listening,</i>

594
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,860
<i>but my generator is dying.</i>

595
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:58,140
<i>So, if there is someone out there,
this is my last song.</i>

596
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,980
<i>This is Laura Merkin,
last survivor of Corpus Christi, Texas,</i>

597
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,780
<i>saying goodbye.</i>

598
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:22,860
Can I see those?

599
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:50,460
Bobby had this crazy idea.

600
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:55,460
She wanted to be a mom.

601
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,340
Can you believe that?

602
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:04,620
Why not?

603
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:08,340
With me?

604
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:15,180
There are some things
I'm just not good at, man.

605
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:20,620
Where did she get...

606
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:23,900
A baby?

607
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:33,740
Who knows?
Maybe I would have been good at it.

608
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:38,420
Hey, Danny. Danny?

609
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:44,660
I gotta tell you something. It's a secret.

610
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:48,340
You want to hear a secret?

611
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,740
- Sure.
- At the stadium,

612
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,260
some of those people, they were...

613
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,620
They were still alive, Danny.

614
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:10,180
We were gonna dump them in the grave
and then...

615
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,620
Some of them would move.

616
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,340
I'd look at the supervisor,

617
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,300
and he'd pretend not to see, so...

618
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:27,060
So we'd pretend not to see them,

619
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,620
but we did.

620
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:34,580
We did, and we'd bury them anyway.

621
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:39,300
- There were so many bodies, Danny.
- I know.

622
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,260
- So many.
- I know.

623
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:47,300
How the hell did we get here?

624
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:54,100
- I don't know, Brian.
- You know.

625
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,100
We both know.

626
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,380
We both know.

627
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,300
We both know.

628
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,700
We both...

629
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:51,180
Where you going, Danny?

630
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:59,380
Where you going, man?

631
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:02,260
We're leaving, Brian.

632
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:16,620
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on!

633
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,700
- Shit!
- Oh, my God.

634
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,100
I need those keys, Brian.

635
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,180
Sure.

636
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:05,940
And I need a ride.

637
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,420
- You know I can't.
- Come on, Danny.

638
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:17,620
The ocean, you and me, one more time.

639
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,300
You remember how it was.

640
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:26,060
Hitting those waves
before everything turned to shit.

641
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,340
Just give me the keys.

642
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,540
You want them?

643
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:37,340
Shoot me or take me with you.

644
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:44,660
- Brian, don't do it.
- I'm not gonna end up like them, Danny.

645
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,300
Rotting alive, alone.

646
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,860
You can't tell whether they're alive
or dead.

647
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:56,300
Please, Brian. Don't.

648
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:02,220
- It's what we decided.
- I'm dying, Danny!

649
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:07,660
I don't give a fuck about the rules.

650
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,700
You made them.

651
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,740
My little brother.

652
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:21,100
I taught him everything he knows.

653
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:18,340
<i>I drive and wait for a storm to come</i>

654
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,740
<i>and wash us all away,</i>

655
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,260
<i>but it doesn't.</i>

656
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,140
<i>It's a beautiful day.</i>

657
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:36,180
<i>And it shouldn't be a beautiful day.</i>

658
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,660
<i>I wait,</i>

659
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,060
<i>but nothing happens to me.</i>

660
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:53,180
<i>And for the first time,
I feel like I am alone in the world.</i>

661
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:12,020
<i>We made it.
Two strangers with nothing left to say.</i>

662
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,740
<i>Brian and I used to love this place,</i>

663
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:23,380
<i>the hotel, the beach.</i>

664
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:32,700
<i>They still look exactly the same,
but they're just places now.</i>

665
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,580
<i>Brian! Danny! Come on!</i>

666
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,940
<i>I don't know what'll happen next.</i>

667
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,220
<i>I don't know how long I'll live.</i>

668
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,420
<i>But I know I will be alone.</i>
