Hi.

37
00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:26.378
Hi.

38
00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:29.077
This is you, right?

39
00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:31.123
Yeah. That's me.

40
00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:34.082
Are you the actor Andy Samberg?

41
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040
I am.

42
00:03:36.084 --> 00:03:36.955
- You are? Yeah.

43
00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:38.304
Are you kidding?

44
00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:41.481
I'm a big fan, man.
Like, a big fan.

45
00:03:41.612 --> 00:03:44.484
Oh, thank you very much. Hey,
I got a question for you.

46
00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:47.095
Do you like limos?

47
00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.184
Do I like limos? Sure. Yeah.

48
00:03:49.315 --> 00:03:50.185
Who doesn't, right?

49
00:03:50.273 --> 00:03:52.144
Right.
- Yeah.

50
00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:53.231
You wanna get in?

51
00:03:55.582 --> 00:03:57.410
Uh...

52
00:03:57.497 --> 00:03:59.630
- Sure.
- Yeah? Come on.

53
00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:12.643
Congrats. You've been selected.

54
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.298
Thanks. For what?

55
00:04:16.864 --> 00:04:18.213
Um, I don't know.

56
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.042
So, um, you know what?

57
00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:25.177
I'm not memorized, so I'm just
gonna read this off the card.

58
00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:27.527
Are you talking to me or...?
SAMBERG: Per the contract.

59
00:04:27.614 --> 00:04:29.050
Huh? No, sorry, you're good.

60
00:04:29.137 --> 00:04:30.217
- Don't worry. Yeah.
- Okay.

61
00:04:30.443 --> 00:04:32.140
Uh, Thomas Walcott.

62
00:04:32.227 --> 00:04:34.665
Single, no children,
no dependents.

63
00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:36.406
Job is network management,

64
00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:38.451
focusing on
statistical analysis.

65
00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:39.757
Physically fit.

66
00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:42.890
Enough.

67
00:04:43.108 --> 00:04:44.936
I guess they're not too
strict about that one.

68
00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:47.155
I'm joking. Kind
of serious though.

69
00:04:47.242 --> 00:04:48.602
All right. I'll
keep it going here.

70
00:04:48.635 --> 00:04:50.483
I'm sorry. I'll keep it
going. I'ma keep it tight.

71
00:04:50.507 --> 00:04:51.986
Uh, after your
breakup... I'm sorry.

72
00:04:52.073 --> 00:04:53.486
You moved back in
with your mother.

73
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.401
Yeah, I'm sorry, Andy Samberg.
How do you know all this?

74
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:57.209
Oh, the company that hired me,

75
00:04:57.818 --> 00:04:59.535
I think they've been
tracking you for a while.

76
00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.300
There's a company
that's been tracking me?

77
00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:03.084
I guess what I would
say is, don't ask me

78
00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:06.044
any specific questions
because they told me nothing.

79
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:08.220
I, I don't know any
details about what it is.

80
00:05:08.568 --> 00:05:12.833
But I do need to ask you, do you
want to continue on this adventure?

81
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.140
Um...

82
00:05:17.838 --> 00:05:19.187
Fuck it. Yes.

83
00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:20.885
- Really?
- Really, yeah. Definitely.

84
00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:22.103
Why would you say yes?

85
00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:25.387
'Cause this is the most exciting
thing that's happened to me in ages.

86
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:27.761
And I don't - want it to end.
- Okay.

87
00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:30.851
I mean, if I say no, then I
have to go back to my life.

88
00:05:31.025 --> 00:05:33.425
And my life is in this, like,
routine. It's, like, I'm stuck.

89
00:05:33.463 --> 00:05:36.074
So saying yes has to be
better than that, right?

90
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.293
I mean, no, not necessarily.

91
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:42.428
But, man, the way you
just phrased that. So sad.

92
00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:44.952
Um... All right, let's go.

93
00:05:55.528 --> 00:05:59.489
How long until we get to, uh,
the next part of the adventure?

94
00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:04.015
You're not supposed to talk.

95
00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:06.887
How come?

96
00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:11.022
I think they just
wanna use all of this.

97
00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:12.153
Build up the tension.

98
00:06:26.777 --> 00:06:29.997
Okay. You see that red
door? Walk through it.

99
00:06:30.084 --> 00:06:32.391
There will be small red arrows
on the ground and walls.

100
00:06:32.478 --> 00:06:33.653
Just follow those.

101
00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:35.742
- You're not coming?
- No, no, I'm done.

102
00:06:35.873 --> 00:06:38.745
Yeah, they just paid me
to get you here. So...

103
00:06:40.486 --> 00:06:42.662
Well, it was really
awesome to meet you.

104
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:44.882
Yeah.

105
00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:47.972
- Maybe we could get a beer.
- Good luck, man.

106
00:06:49.452 --> 00:06:51.715
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Yeah.

107
00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:17.670
Come sit.

108
00:08:18.845 --> 00:08:19.845
Please.

109
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:24.981
Okay.

110
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.826
Congratulations.

111
00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:45.176
You have been
selected to partake

112
00:08:45.263 --> 00:08:48.353
in the biggest reality
show in the dark web.

113
00:08:49.354 --> 00:08:51.574
There will be people
trying to kill you.

114
00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:52.965
The hunters.

115
00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:56.056
What are you talking about?

116
00:08:56.143 --> 00:08:57.928
There's people
trying to murder me?

117
00:08:58.058 --> 00:08:59.058
Very much so.

118
00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:06.763
Each participant selected will
have 30 days to... survive.

119
00:09:07.372 --> 00:09:09.461
If they survive 30 days,

120
00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:13.683
they will receive one
million dollars, cash.

121
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.947
The hunters will be all
around the world, Mr. Walcott,

122
00:09:17.034 --> 00:09:20.080
and, uh, might not
make it to your city.

123
00:09:20.254 --> 00:09:22.561
So you will be safe
until they find you.

124
00:09:22.648 --> 00:09:25.008
You might spend the next 30
days and never encounter anyone,

125
00:09:25.085 --> 00:09:27.174
but you still make
the million dollars.

126
00:09:28.175 --> 00:09:30.177
We will be filming
you the entire time.

127
00:09:30.264 --> 00:09:31.264
How?

128
00:09:31.744 --> 00:09:33.809
Production assistants have
already bugged your residence

129
00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:36.444
as well as places
we expect you to go.

130
00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:40.971
They will travel as you
do. You will not see them.

131
00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:42.886
They are highly
skilled at evasion.

132
00:09:44.104 --> 00:09:47.238
So they're kind of like
production assistant ninjas?

133
00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:49.675
No, they are not trained ninjas.

134
00:09:49.762 --> 00:09:52.330
I didn't say trained
ninjas, I said like ninjas.

135
00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:58.118
But if it helps you to say yes,
to think of them as ninjas,

136
00:09:58.684 --> 00:10:00.077
we are fine with that.

137
00:10:00.425 --> 00:10:03.123
Excuse me. I need to
stand up for a moment.

138
00:10:03.254 --> 00:10:05.212
- Yeah, please. Thank you.

139
00:10:12.306 --> 00:10:13.438
What are you thinking?

140
00:10:13.568 --> 00:10:16.441
I mean, what can I do
to help you say yes?

141
00:10:16.528 --> 00:10:18.704
Ah, nothing. I don't
think I can do this.

142
00:10:18.791 --> 00:10:20.488
Oh, you can. You should.

143
00:10:22.403 --> 00:10:25.711
Well, come sit down, yeah.
You can always say no.

144
00:10:25.798 --> 00:10:28.018
So, just come sit
for a minute. Yeah?

145
00:10:30.455 --> 00:10:32.109
It's very interesting, guys.

146
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.634
I just, I don't think that I can do
this. I can't risk other people's lives.

147
00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:38.332
I can't, I can't have my
roommate catching a bullet

148
00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:40.247
'cause I'm playing
some silly game.

149
00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.859
Your mother will be safe.

150
00:10:43.729 --> 00:10:45.818
How do you... How can
you guarantee that?

151
00:10:45.992 --> 00:10:48.429
You will only be killed
when you are alone.

152
00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:51.844
What does that mean, I'll
only be killed when I'm alone?

153
00:10:51.868 --> 00:10:55.698
If you are with someone else,
the hunters will have to wait.

154
00:10:56.307 --> 00:10:59.136
There is no risk to anyone else.

155
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.444
But once alone, you
are no longer safe.

156
00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:05.663
So that's a loophole.

157
00:11:05.969 --> 00:11:08.711
Well, this is no loophole.
It's just a rule.

158
00:11:08.798 --> 00:11:10.016
Well, it's kind of a loophole.

159
00:11:10.756 --> 00:11:13.803
What if I was with, like, my mom or
my sisters every second of every day?

160
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.066
You would need to
spend every moment

161
00:11:16.153 --> 00:11:19.939
with them in close proximity.
It's not as easy as it sounds.

162
00:11:21.288 --> 00:11:23.073
Yeah. If the person
you're with walks

163
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.685
to the other side of the room,
you are vulnerable for attack.

164
00:11:27.338 --> 00:11:30.384
You must be within
striking distance from them

165
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.822
each and every second.

166
00:11:32.996 --> 00:11:37.304
So let me get this straight.
It's 30 days, right?

167
00:11:37.391 --> 00:11:38.958
And you guys are
hunting me for my life.

168
00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:42.396
But you cannot touch
me if I'm with someone,

169
00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:45.748
and the hunters might not
even ever make it to my city.

170
00:11:45.965 --> 00:11:48.838
So there's a chance I
spend the entire 30 days

171
00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:50.491
and no one even finds me.

172
00:11:50.578 --> 00:11:53.538
And then I get a million
dollars. That's the game?

173
00:11:54.582 --> 00:11:57.368
- Yes.
- Are you interested?

174
00:12:05.419 --> 00:12:06.507
Let's play.

175
00:12:11.599 --> 00:12:15.038
I just wanna make sure that I'm
clear on what you're saying.

176
00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:17.954
What you called us all here
on a Saturday to say, which is

177
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:20.521
that Andy Samberg pulled
up to you driving a limo?

178
00:12:20.608 --> 00:12:23.133
- No, I, I'm not saying that.
Okay. What are you saying?

179
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.220
He had a chauffeur.

180
00:12:24.874 --> 00:12:27.702
I'd hope so. Oh, I'm sorry.
I botched that detail.

181
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.376
Oh, you're damn right
he'd have a driver.

182
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.141
The Sams ain't driving himself.

183
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:32.925
Don't call him The
Sams. He goes by Andy.

184
00:12:33.012 --> 00:12:35.469
- What are you, his publicist?
- Yeah, you're his best friend now?

185
00:12:35.493 --> 00:12:37.321
No, but he, no, I didn't
call him The Sams.

186
00:12:37.408 --> 00:12:38.864
- He didn't introduce himself.
- I call him The Sams.

187
00:12:38.888 --> 00:12:41.020
You've never met him.

188
00:12:41.151 --> 00:12:42.761
Andy Samberg.
- Yeah.

189
00:12:42.848 --> 00:12:45.546
Is like, "Hey Tommy, get
in, get in the backseat."

190
00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:48.680
I'm just trying to get it right.

191
00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:50.092
I didn't, okay, this is
getting turned around.

192
00:12:50.116 --> 00:12:51.857
I'm done talking about
Andy fucking Samberg.

193
00:12:51.944 --> 00:12:53.119
If the hunters find me,

194
00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:55.295
you need to be with me
24/7 so I don't die.

195
00:12:55.382 --> 00:12:57.994
Oh, hey, but, like, aren't
there other people playing

196
00:12:58.081 --> 00:13:00.083
the pretend-y game who
could hang out with you?

197
00:13:00.387 --> 00:13:03.086
I posted a cryptic message
on, uh, Craigslist.

198
00:13:03.173 --> 00:13:05.064
I'm waiting to hear back,
but I can't depend on it.

199
00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:06.717
So in the meantime, I need
to lean on the family.

200
00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:10.310
Okay. Tommy, you are delusional.

201
00:13:10.397 --> 00:13:11.834
I am not delusional.

202
00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:14.662
What about when you
told everybody at school

203
00:13:14.749 --> 00:13:16.751
that you were moving to Japan

204
00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:20.320
to become a Samurai with Dad
after he left? How about that?

205
00:13:20.407 --> 00:13:22.646
Great idea. Bringing up when
Dad left, right in front of Mom.

206
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.021
Okay, what about the
time that you made us all

207
00:13:25.108 --> 00:13:27.806
call you Michael
Jackson for a year?

208
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.653
Okay, you know what,
guys?'Cause I liked his music.

209
00:13:29.677 --> 00:13:31.220
No, you know what, guys?
- Stop. Stop. - I was a fan.

210
00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:32.395
There's a big difference
between liking...

211
00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:33.419
What is the difference?

212
00:13:33.943 --> 00:13:36.225
Stop, stop. Just a minute, okay?
Just hang on just a minute.

213
00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:38.991
Honey, do you think that
all this, Andy Samberg,

214
00:13:39.078 --> 00:13:43.126
Greenlandic ninjas, the
Internet killing show

215
00:13:43.213 --> 00:13:47.130
is really, really
more about the fact

216
00:13:47.217 --> 00:13:50.785
that Theresa broke up with
you and now she has a baby?

217
00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:55.138
So you created this
all as a diversion

218
00:13:55.225 --> 00:13:57.314
so that you wouldn't have
to feel the emotional pain

219
00:13:57.401 --> 00:14:00.534
of that loss. I mean,
is that a possibility?

220
00:14:01.448 --> 00:14:02.448
Well, first of all,

221
00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.253
thanks for bringing up my
breakup in this moment.

222
00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:07.063
It feels like a great time
for a mother to do that.

223
00:14:07.454 --> 00:14:09.761
Um, and second, um,

224
00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:12.503
if you're implying, lemme just
try to do the math on this,

225
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.246
that the producers of this game

226
00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:17.900
implanted my ex-girlfriend,

227
00:14:17.987 --> 00:14:21.164
who I haven't talked
to in nearly two years,

228
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:23.557
uh, with a baby.

229
00:14:23.644 --> 00:14:26.386
She grew the baby and
had it in order to get me

230
00:14:26.473 --> 00:14:29.476
to risk my life for
a million dollars?

231
00:14:29.563 --> 00:14:31.150
Right, but if all that
happened, then possibly.

232
00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:33.785
But to me that seems a
little wacky. Are you okay?

233
00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:35.004
- I'm done.
- Are you okay?

234
00:14:35.395 --> 00:14:36.851
I'm done with this, Tommy.'Cause
I'm worried about you.

235
00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:37.875
- Tommy.
- What?

236
00:14:38.094 --> 00:14:39.549
You're lonely, so
find a club, you know.

237
00:14:39.573 --> 00:14:40.811
Yeah. That's not
what this is about.

238
00:14:40.835 --> 00:14:42.117
- Do a hobby or something.
- Yeah, I understand.

239
00:14:42.141 --> 00:14:43.751
- Just, this is sad.
- Yeah, thanks.

240
00:14:43.926 --> 00:14:46.319
And this is all in
your head. Get over it.

241
00:14:46.406 --> 00:14:47.906
Don't leave that ice cream,
cause I'll eat it all.

242
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.932
- Great. Bye, Mom.
I'll see you Thursday.

243
00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:51.344
Is, is it Thursday? I
thought it was Friday.

244
00:14:51.368 --> 00:14:52.562
- No, it's Thursday.
Bye, Tommy!

245
00:14:52.586 --> 00:14:53.781
I hope the ninjas
don't kill you.

246
00:14:53.805 --> 00:14:55.720
Mom. You believe me, right?

247
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.635
Not even a little.

248
00:16:36.777 --> 00:16:37.777
Hello?

249
00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:49.833
Hello?

250
00:17:41.712 --> 00:17:43.148
Tommy, what?

251
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.671
Someone found me.

252
00:17:45.019 --> 00:17:46.804
<i>Oh, good. Well, now
that they found you,</i>

253
00:17:46.934 --> 00:17:48.214
maybe you can move in with them.

254
00:17:48.284 --> 00:17:49.894
<i>It was a production assistant.</i>

255
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:51.504
<i>It was one of the
ninjas with a camera.</i>

256
00:17:51.591 --> 00:17:53.202
Oh, God. This crap, again?

257
00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:57.293
Mom, I'm holding a tiny
camera in my hands right now.

258
00:17:57.423 --> 00:18:00.165
A tiny-What are you
holding a tiny camera for?

259
00:18:00.252 --> 00:18:02.143
It's either that or a piece
of rat shit. I'm not sure.

260
00:18:02.167 --> 00:18:04.474
But- Or, like, a, a
weird little blueberry.

261
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:06.495
<i>Either way, do you understand
what I'm saying, Mom?</i>

262
00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:07.540
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

263
00:18:07.564 --> 00:18:09.392
You're holding a tiny
piece of rat shit

264
00:18:09.479 --> 00:18:11.220
and you're... Hi.

265
00:18:11.307 --> 00:18:14.397
And you're pretending
that it's a camera.

266
00:18:14.484 --> 00:18:16.747
Put it down. Wash your
hands. It's full of diseases.

267
00:18:16.834 --> 00:18:18.159
Okay, you're not listening
to what I'm saying.

268
00:18:18.183 --> 00:18:19.463
I need to come
see you right now.

269
00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:20.944
I need to come to the
hospital. I can't be alone.

270
00:18:20.968 --> 00:18:23.797
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Mom, do you want me killed?

271
00:18:23.884 --> 00:18:25.147
<i>You know what, at this point,</i>

272
00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:27.584
I think that, that I
would prefer Sandy Amberg

273
00:18:27.671 --> 00:18:29.281
to murder you on a computer show

274
00:18:29.368 --> 00:18:31.936
than have you come down
here and get me fired.

275
00:18:32.023 --> 00:18:34.330
His name is Andy Samberg.

276
00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:37.420
I don't care what his
name... Call your sister.

277
00:18:38.638 --> 00:18:39.638
Oh, God.

278
00:18:39.857 --> 00:18:41.902
Dude, I heard
something, like, bang.

279
00:18:41.989 --> 00:18:45.210
It spooked me, man. Like, I
know they're on to me now.

280
00:18:45.297 --> 00:18:46.777
I left the back door closed.

281
00:18:46.907 --> 00:18:49.736
I mean, I get it. Your mom's
at work. It's after midnight.

282
00:18:50.128 --> 00:18:51.564
You can't just run over there.

283
00:18:51.912 --> 00:18:54.001
Well, this... Yeah,
either way, man.

284
00:18:54.088 --> 00:18:55.762
I appreciate it. I didn't
know what I was gonna do.

285
00:18:55.786 --> 00:18:56.787
I can't be alone.

286
00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:59.099
Yeah, no, your sister
doesn't get home until two.

287
00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:01.420
So you're more than welcome to
crash here with us on the couch.

288
00:19:01.444 --> 00:19:02.444
You'll be good.

289
00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:06.294
Yeah, and then what time do you wanna
hop in there and go to bed together?

290
00:19:06.318 --> 00:19:07.318
Huh?

291
00:19:08.015 --> 00:19:10.168
At what point you wanna... If
we hang out here, we'll watch...

292
00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:12.953
I'm beat now. I'm ready for bed. I'll
keep watching the movie with you,

293
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.110
but I don't, I don't care.
I mean, I'm zonked, bro.

294
00:19:16.502 --> 00:19:18.548
You wanna sleep in
the bed with me?

295
00:19:19.331 --> 00:19:20.506
No.

296
00:19:24.902 --> 00:19:26.342
Good, man. 'Cause
for a second there,

297
00:19:26.382 --> 00:19:27.968
I was a little confused
of what you were asking.

298
00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:29.820
I have to for my safety.

299
00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:33.998
What?

300
00:19:34.346 --> 00:19:36.566
I have to sleep in bed with
you so that I don't die.

301
00:19:36.653 --> 00:19:37.958
These are the rules, my man.

302
00:19:38.742 --> 00:19:41.832
Look, bro, I don't want you to die. I
want you to be safe. You're my brother.

303
00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:43.268
- I love you.
- I love you.

304
00:19:43.355 --> 00:19:45.923
But we not sleeping
in the same bed.

305
00:19:48.969 --> 00:19:50.536
- Yes, we are.
- No, we're not.

306
00:19:50.623 --> 00:19:51.494
Yes, we are.

307
00:19:51.581 --> 00:19:52.495
- No, we are not.
- Yes, we are.

308
00:19:52.582 --> 00:19:53.844
- We are not.
- Yes, we are.

309
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:55.324
- No.
- Yes.

310
00:19:58.152 --> 00:19:59.937
- Well, goodnight, man.
- Shut the fuck up.

311
00:20:26.746 --> 00:20:28.531
Oh, shit. No, no, no, no.

312
00:20:28.618 --> 00:20:31.447
Oh, no. Malcolm! Malcolm!

313
00:20:31.534 --> 00:20:34.188
I'm in the bathroom.
- Ah, ah. Oh, God.

314
00:20:34.276 --> 00:20:36.452
What's going on?

315
00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:39.672
I am in the bathroom taking
a shit. What's happening?

316
00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:43.241
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, man?

317
00:20:43.328 --> 00:20:45.417
- Why'd you leave my side?
- I had to take a shit.

318
00:20:45.504 --> 00:20:47.419
Why didn't you wake me
up and bring me with you?

319
00:20:47.506 --> 00:20:49.291
Because I'm taking a shit.

320
00:20:49.378 --> 00:20:51.380
I can't be alone.

321
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:54.141
I'm not gonna wake you up to bring
you in here to take a shit with me.

322
00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:55.882
He's right here. He's taking
a dump. He's taking a dump.

323
00:20:55.906 --> 00:20:58.125
Put the rifle down. No, no,
no. Get up, get up, get up.

324
00:20:58.212 --> 00:20:59.451
Do not pull me off-Turn around.

325
00:20:59.475 --> 00:21:01.477
- Turn the fuck around.
- What are you doing?

326
00:21:01.564 --> 00:21:04.523
He's right here.
What the? God.

327
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.699
Man, there's nobody out there.

328
00:21:07.483 --> 00:21:09.659
Well...

329
00:21:13.489 --> 00:21:14.359
They found me.

330
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.492
They found you, alright.

331
00:21:20.104 --> 00:21:22.193
- Get out.
- Huh?

332
00:21:23.455 --> 00:21:25.239
Get out!

333
00:21:25.327 --> 00:21:27.764
What you are doing
is irresponsible.

334
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:29.243
You are not thinking
clearly, man.

335
00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:30.331
Oh, yes, I am.

336
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:32.092
No, you're not.
- And when Amy comes home,

337
00:21:32.116 --> 00:21:33.485
I'll explain to her that you
kicked in our bathroom door...

338
00:21:33.509 --> 00:21:35.946
I was being hunted... and
pulled me off the toilet.

339
00:21:36.033 --> 00:21:37.774
I can't be alone.
I've told you that.

340
00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:39.273
- I can't be alone.
- I had to go to the bathroom.

341
00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:40.709
- I'm sorry.
- What was I supposed to do?

342
00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:42.232
Wake you up so I can have
another man watch me dump?

343
00:21:42.256 --> 00:21:43.256
No, that's gross.

344
00:21:43.388 --> 00:21:44.931
I know it's gross. I
didn't wanna do it.

345
00:21:44.955 --> 00:21:47.740
I don't have a choice.
I can't be alone, man.

346
00:21:47.827 --> 00:21:48.872
Fuck.

347
00:21:56.314 --> 00:21:57.489
Hey, you see that guy?

348
00:21:58.708 --> 00:21:59.708
Who, him?

349
00:22:00.231 --> 00:22:01.449
Yeah, him. Do you see
him? Yeah, I see him.

350
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.799
Just watch me
until I get to him.

351
00:22:02.886 --> 00:22:05.279
Please do not leave until
I'm with that man, okay?

352
00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:06.367
You sure?

353
00:22:06.629 --> 00:22:08.128
Yes, I'm sure. You promise
you'll keep watching?

354
00:22:08.152 --> 00:22:10.110
I promise I'll watch you.

355
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:14.201
I'm sorry I pulled you off a toilet
while you were taking a dump.

356
00:22:14.288 --> 00:22:16.160
It's all right.
I'll forgive you.

357
00:22:16.987 --> 00:22:18.075
We family.

358
00:22:27.171 --> 00:22:28.259
Excuse me, sir.

359
00:22:29.129 --> 00:22:32.002
Hi. Uh, are, are you interested
in making some money?

360
00:22:32.089 --> 00:22:33.264
Yeah.

361
00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:35.135
Yeah?
- Yeah, how much?

362
00:22:35.222 --> 00:22:38.487
This is so weird. Very weird.

363
00:22:38.574 --> 00:22:40.358
You have no idea, man.
You're saving my life.

364
00:22:40.445 --> 00:22:42.684
- Now well, how could that be?
- Because I can't be alone,

365
00:22:42.708 --> 00:22:44.275
'cause I'm playing
this dark web game.

366
00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:46.202
And so the whole thing
about it is if I'm alone

367
00:22:46.233 --> 00:22:47.472
even for a second,
I can be killed.

368
00:22:47.496 --> 00:22:48.714
But if I'm with you, I'm safe.

369
00:22:48.801 --> 00:22:50.803
So you'll just shadow
me and then I'm safe.

370
00:22:55.634 --> 00:22:57.375
What the fuck is this?

371
00:22:57.462 --> 00:22:59.353
I'm gonna need you to be a
little bit more specific.

372
00:22:59.377 --> 00:23:00.726
You need me to be more specific?

373
00:23:00.813 --> 00:23:02.946
How about the stranger who's
eating Mom's Raisin Bran.

374
00:23:03.033 --> 00:23:04.271
Is that specific
enough for you, Tommy?

375
00:23:04.295 --> 00:23:05.533
Amy, you don't have
to-don't be rude, honey.

376
00:23:05.557 --> 00:23:06.557
- Mom.
- Don't.

377
00:23:07.254 --> 00:23:10.823
You called me to come over here,
so please don't be soft now, okay?

378
00:23:11.302 --> 00:23:15.524
Malcolm told me that you pulled
him off the toilet last night

379
00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:18.222
when he was in the middle
of using the bathroom.

380
00:23:18.309 --> 00:23:20.398
Well, I asked him to
stand. He wouldn't stand.

381
00:23:20.485 --> 00:23:23.793
I'm sorry I revealed his bare
bottom. That was not my intention.

382
00:23:24.446 --> 00:23:25.969
And this is James,
my new friend.

383
00:23:26.099 --> 00:23:27.274
Hi, James.

384
00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:28.405
Hi, Tommy's family.

385
00:23:28.493 --> 00:23:30.147
Oh, we are very
happy to have you.

386
00:23:30.277 --> 00:23:34.368
Mm. I'm very happy to be here.
I slept great last night.

387
00:23:34.456 --> 00:23:35.326
Me too, man.

388
00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:36.936
Good.

389
00:23:37.067 --> 00:23:38.566
James, would you mind just
stepping outside, please,

390
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.505
for a minute, so I can
talk to my son now.

391
00:23:40.636 --> 00:23:43.160
Oh, I can't do that. He
pays me to shadow him.

392
00:23:43.247 --> 00:23:44.596
It's my job.

393
00:23:44.901 --> 00:23:46.511
Oh, wow. That is amazing.

394
00:23:46.642 --> 00:23:47.773
- Shadow?
- Good work.

395
00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:50.210
Thank you for taking my
unique situation seriously.

396
00:23:50.297 --> 00:23:52.169
It genuinely means
the world to me.

397
00:23:52.256 --> 00:23:53.692
'Cause I'm kind
of in a tough spot

398
00:23:53.779 --> 00:23:55.496
and you're the only one
who's kind of helping.

399
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.435
So thank you. But
you can step outside.

400
00:23:57.522 --> 00:23:58.610
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

401
00:23:58.697 --> 00:23:59.568
Okay.

402
00:23:59.655 --> 00:24:01.134
- Don't go far.
- I won't.

403
00:24:04.747 --> 00:24:06.507
What in the actual fuck
is going on with you?

404
00:24:06.575 --> 00:24:08.359
There was a cowboy
who had a rifle...

405
00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:10.274
- A cowboy? A cowboy.
On me last night.

406
00:24:10.361 --> 00:24:12.406
And he was going to
shoot me and kill me.

407
00:24:12.537 --> 00:24:14.800
I cannot be alone, you guys.

408
00:24:15.932 --> 00:24:17.475
I thought you were
gonna be more supportive

409
00:24:17.499 --> 00:24:19.805
or I never would've signed
up for this fucking game.

410
00:24:19.892 --> 00:24:22.242
Oh, that's not fair.
- Supportive. - I support this.

411
00:24:22.373 --> 00:24:24.810
So, yes, I hired a person
without a home to shadow me.

412
00:24:24.897 --> 00:24:26.420
Why?'Cause you're a weirdo.

413
00:24:26.551 --> 00:24:28.074
Because I don't wanna die.

414
00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:30.773
You cannot have this person
sleeping in Mom's house.

415
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.514
We don't know him.
It's not safe.

416
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:34.777
Then how about this.
Are you gonna shadow me?

417
00:24:34.864 --> 00:24:36.518
- No. Are you gonna shadow me?

418
00:24:36.605 --> 00:24:38.868
- No, I'm not gonna shadow.
Are you gonna shadow me?

419
00:24:38.955 --> 00:24:41.261
I don't wanna take
away James's job.

420
00:24:41.914 --> 00:24:43.394
So what choice do I have here?

421
00:24:43.655 --> 00:24:47.137
Okay, well, Mom...
Mom, kick him out.

422
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:49.681
He's an adult. He has
money. He's got a job.

423
00:24:49.705 --> 00:24:51.145
- Mom, we had a deal.
- Kick him out.

424
00:24:51.228 --> 00:24:52.489
You said, as long as I had a
job, I could stay with you.

425
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.360
I have a job.

426
00:24:53.447 --> 00:24:54.318
- Mom.
- Mom.

427
00:24:54.405 --> 00:24:55.754
- No. Mom.
- Mom.

428
00:24:55.885 --> 00:24:57.451
Yeah, I did. No,
I did say that.

429
00:24:57.539 --> 00:25:00.933
I remember saying that. But that,
now, now this, this whole thing

430
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.154
about picking people up
off of the toilet bowls.

431
00:25:04.241 --> 00:25:06.112
Honey, that's, I mean, come on.

432
00:25:06.199 --> 00:25:10.769
That, I mean, no more of that. Okay?
All right, that's fair I think.

433
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.030
As long as I got him,

434
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.902
I don't have to pull anybody
off a toilet bowl, right?

435
00:25:13.903 --> 00:25:15.382
That's why I have him.

436
00:25:15.905 --> 00:25:17.384
But that's over. That's a deal.

437
00:25:18.168 --> 00:25:19.909
Yeah, very tough,
Mom. Well done.

438
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:26.132
Whoa.

439
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.526
This is gonna end
badly. I guarantee it.

440
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.319
Where's your best friend?

441
00:26:22.406 --> 00:26:23.494
I don't know.

442
00:26:23.755 --> 00:26:25.595
I tried calling him,
hopefully he's on his way.

443
00:26:25.975 --> 00:26:27.561
Long and short of it is
I gotta crash with you

444
00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:28.867
- a couple of days.
- Well, you can't.

445
00:26:28.891 --> 00:26:29.891
Yes, I can.

446
00:26:29.935 --> 00:26:31.415
- No, you can't.
- I actually have to.

447
00:26:31.502 --> 00:26:33.460
- Mom kicked me out.
- Wow, 'cause you got fired?

448
00:26:33.547 --> 00:26:34.984
Yes, I had to deal with...

449
00:26:35.941 --> 00:26:37.203
Holy shit.

450
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.075
Oh my God. Is that
the Craigslist post?

451
00:26:39.162 --> 00:26:40.946
It's also happening
to me. Shall we chat?

452
00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:42.881
- This is exactly what I want.
- Honestly, get your hands off.

453
00:26:42.905 --> 00:26:44.105
Can you just forward it to me?

454
00:26:44.254 --> 00:26:45.361
- Stay here. Don't go away.
- Just forward it to me.

455
00:26:45.385 --> 00:26:47.474
Sorry, it's really
loud. Gimme one sec.

456
00:26:47.561 --> 00:26:49.738
This is the guy from Craigslist.

457
00:26:49.825 --> 00:26:50.695
Oh, hi. Yeah.

458
00:26:50.826 --> 00:26:53.350
I saw your ad.
I'm a participant.

459
00:26:53.437 --> 00:26:54.568
How do I know you're real?

460
00:26:54.656 --> 00:26:55.918
<i>How do I know you're real?</i>

461
00:26:56.092 --> 00:26:58.200
Yeah, but this could be a
setup. You could be hunting me.

462
00:26:58.224 --> 00:27:00.357
You could be hunting
me. <i>Okay, so let's meet.</i>

463
00:27:00.444 --> 00:27:02.664
<i>You wanna meet in public
somewhere so it's safe?</i>

464
00:27:02.751 --> 00:27:04.404
<i>How's that?</i> MADDY:
Okay, sure. When?

465
00:27:04.491 --> 00:27:05.841
Uh, now.

466
00:27:06.276 --> 00:27:08.356
<i>No, it's the middle of the
night. I could do tomorrow.</i>

467
00:27:09.235 --> 00:27:11.368
Okay, you know where
La Cita is downtown?

468
00:27:11.455 --> 00:27:12.630
<i>No, but I can figure it out.</i>

469
00:27:12.761 --> 00:27:14.980
Great, let's meet there
tomorrow at 10:00 AM.

470
00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:16.068
Can you do that?

471
00:27:16.242 --> 00:27:17.983
Okay. How are you
gonna recognize me?

472
00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:21.073
You got anything yellow?
Like, a yellow hat?

473
00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.422
<i>I've got a banana sweatshirt.</i>

474
00:27:22.509 --> 00:27:23.815
What's a banana sweatshirt?

475
00:27:24.033 --> 00:27:25.750
<i>It's a sweatshirt with
a giant banana on it.</i>

476
00:27:25.774 --> 00:27:27.863
Okay. Wear the
banana sweatshirt.

477
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.560
Okay, are you gonna
be wearing yellow?

478
00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:32.713
No, it would be ridiculous if we were
both wearing yellow clothes, right?

479
00:27:32.737 --> 00:27:35.000
That's a good point.
I'll see you tomorrow.

480
00:27:35.087 --> 00:27:36.219
Yeah, great. This is good.

481
00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:39.048
Oh shit!

482
00:27:56.413 --> 00:27:57.413
Stop.

483
00:27:59.285 --> 00:28:01.070
Oh, God. Oh.

484
00:28:01.287 --> 00:28:03.376
- I'm not, I'm not alone.
- You're alone.

485
00:28:03.463 --> 00:28:05.988
I'm not! James is coming.
He's on his way right now.

486
00:28:06.249 --> 00:28:08.468
Oh, God. Oh, God.

487
00:28:24.093 --> 00:28:26.704
Help! Fucking help! Help! Help!

488
00:28:26.791 --> 00:28:28.706
SOS! Hey, did you
not hear me, man?

489
00:28:28.793 --> 00:28:30.945
- No, what happened?
- What the fuck you doing standing here?

490
00:28:30.969 --> 00:28:31.970
I'm here.

491
00:28:32.405 --> 00:28:34.625
I was just choked by a giant.
He was trying to kill me.

492
00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:36.821
He, he was wearing a, a red
leather jacket with the...

493
00:28:36.845 --> 00:28:39.325
He was wearing a fucking
Michael Jackson jacket.

494
00:28:39.412 --> 00:28:41.371
He was wearing the
fucking "Thriller" jacket.

495
00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:43.618
You got choked by a giant
dressed like Michael Jackson.

496
00:28:43.677 --> 00:28:44.677
He had the zippers.

497
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.116
He had the Michael Jackson
"Thriller" video zippers.

498
00:28:47.203 --> 00:28:50.336
Sorry, that's the jacket from...
That's not the "Thriller" jacket.

499
00:28:50.728 --> 00:28:52.338
- What?
- The "Thriller" jacket?

500
00:28:52.425 --> 00:28:54.601
The one, the- Was it a
zippers jacket, right?

501
00:28:54.732 --> 00:28:56.386
Yeah. That from "Beat It."

502
00:28:56.516 --> 00:28:58.736
The "Thriller" jacket,
they're similar jackets.

503
00:28:58.823 --> 00:28:59.955
Tommy!
- I'm sorry.

504
00:29:00.129 --> 00:29:03.088
Tommy. I'm here. I'm sorry, man.

505
00:29:03.523 --> 00:29:05.221
- Oh, man. I'm sorry, man.

506
00:29:05.308 --> 00:29:08.833
- Where the fuck were you, man?
- I was waiting for your call.

507
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.531
I fucking called you ten times.

508
00:29:11.618 --> 00:29:14.404
My phone never rang.
Maybe it's dead.

509
00:29:16.188 --> 00:29:17.799
Okay, let's just go, man.

510
00:29:19.409 --> 00:29:22.020
Tell my sister I was
almost murdered. Okay?

511
00:29:22.107 --> 00:29:23.456
I'm gonna give
her a full report.

512
00:29:24.022 --> 00:29:25.110
Thanks but hang on.

513
00:29:25.371 --> 00:29:27.211
We gotta get that thing
a charger, and we're...

514
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.202
It's pretty fucking annoying,
but also really cool

515
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:32.049
how much you know about
Michael Jackson, man.

516
00:29:32.074 --> 00:29:33.815
I loved his music
when I was a kid.

517
00:29:38.167 --> 00:29:39.821
Thanks. Me too.

518
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:44.521
All right. Is your phone
100 percent charged?

519
00:29:44.608 --> 00:29:46.653
Yes, sir. It is.
- Okay, let's do this.

520
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.577
I think that's her. She
doesn't look that scary to me.

521
00:29:57.664 --> 00:29:59.928
Well, you never know.
Stay with me, okay?

522
00:30:00.015 --> 00:30:02.495
Okay, I got your back.
Don't worry about it.

523
00:30:04.106 --> 00:30:06.848
Hi, are you, uh, are you the
lady from, uh, Craigslist?

524
00:30:06.935 --> 00:30:08.501
- Yeah. You are?

525
00:30:09.372 --> 00:30:11.132
Why aren't you wearing
the, uh, banana sweatshirt

526
00:30:11.156 --> 00:30:12.742
- like you said?
- Oh, I got self-conscious.

527
00:30:12.766 --> 00:30:14.116
About what?

528
00:30:14.203 --> 00:30:15.923
It's a sweatshirt with
a giant banana on it.

529
00:30:16.466 --> 00:30:18.468
But this is yellow,
so I wore this.

530
00:30:18.555 --> 00:30:19.686
Do you guys wanna sit?

531
00:30:19.773 --> 00:30:20.600
- Yeah. Let's sit down.
- Yeah, please.

532
00:30:20.687 --> 00:30:21.687
- Great.
- Uh...

533
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:23.559
Would you mind sitting there, - James?
- I don't mind.

534
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.170
Oh, thanks for meeting.
- Yeah, sure.

535
00:30:25.344 --> 00:30:27.477
It's nice to meet you. I'm Tom.

536
00:30:27.564 --> 00:30:28.434
- Maddy. Maddy?

537
00:30:28.521 --> 00:30:29.521
- Yeah. Yeah.

538
00:30:29.609 --> 00:30:31.481
- How many days you got left?
- Fifteen.

539
00:30:31.611 --> 00:30:33.570
- You?
- Sixteen.

540
00:30:36.878 --> 00:30:38.488
I got a question for ya.

541
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.100
If you're playing the game, then how
the fuck are you alone right now?

542
00:30:43.232 --> 00:30:44.232
I'm not alone.

543
00:30:45.103 --> 00:30:47.322
Well, we don't count. We just got here.
You were alone before we got here.

544
00:30:47.323 --> 00:30:50.243
- Yeah, my Mom's right over there.
- Okay, well, that's my Dad right there.

545
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.980
- Mom?
- Yeah, oh, yeah?

546
00:30:52.415 --> 00:30:53.416
- Hi.
- Hi.

547
00:30:53.764 --> 00:30:55.940
Just checking
in. Oh, sure. Hi.

548
00:30:56.245 --> 00:30:58.508
- Anything else I need to
prove? Let's cut the shit.

549
00:31:00.075 --> 00:31:02.270
You're not with them, right?
You're not gonna murder me?

550
00:31:02.294 --> 00:31:05.036
- Are you actually asking me that?
- I really am. Yes.

551
00:31:05.776 --> 00:31:08.866
Well, if I was gonna murder you, I
wouldn't tell you. I'd just murder you.

552
00:31:08.953 --> 00:31:11.782
Right, but I don't think you're gonna.
But just say it so I can hear it.

553
00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:13.629
You're not gonna... No,
I'm not gonna murder you.

554
00:31:13.653 --> 00:31:14.653
Are you gonna murder me?

555
00:31:14.741 --> 00:31:17.092
No, I wanna be on
the same team as you.

556
00:31:17.179 --> 00:31:18.179
Great.

557
00:31:19.007 --> 00:31:20.051
So that's settled.

558
00:31:20.747 --> 00:31:21.747
This feels good, right?

559
00:31:21.792 --> 00:31:22.880
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

560
00:31:22.967 --> 00:31:24.510
- Mm-hmm.
- You think what I'm thinking?

561
00:31:24.534 --> 00:31:27.102
Mm-hmm. I hope so.

562
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.933
You know what I think we should
do? I think we should partner up.

563
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.300
What does that mean, partner up?

564
00:31:33.369 --> 00:31:34.889
I mean, spend all of
our time together.

565
00:31:34.936 --> 00:31:37.217
They can't kill us if we're
together, right? The loophole.

566
00:31:38.765 --> 00:31:40.205
You wanna spend all
our time together

567
00:31:40.289 --> 00:31:41.609
after knowing me
for five minutes?

568
00:31:42.073 --> 00:31:44.747
Come on, let's just do this. Let's
team up. Let's fucking win together.

569
00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:45.772
Right.

570
00:31:47.426 --> 00:31:50.473
I, I don't know if I'm ready to
say okay to the full 15 days.

571
00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:56.716
I couldn't understand
a word you said, buddy.

572
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.177
I said, "Go for
what you can get."

573
00:32:00.222 --> 00:32:02.615
Would you be willing to
commit for the rest of today?

574
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:14.236
Wow, look at this.

575
00:32:15.237 --> 00:32:16.890
- Beautiful house.
- Wow.

576
00:32:16.978 --> 00:32:18.196
Thanks.
- Yeah.

577
00:32:19.589 --> 00:32:21.939
Is it just you and, uh,
your parents here then?

578
00:32:22.026 --> 00:32:25.856
Uh, well, it's just me
and my Mom. My dad died.

579
00:32:26.378 --> 00:32:28.400
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- No, it was a long time ago.

580
00:32:28.424 --> 00:32:30.643
- He was in a car accident.
- Oof.

581
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.733
It was a drunk driver.
He was a drunk driver.

582
00:32:34.821 --> 00:32:37.215
He was a veteran though. So his
funeral was really beautiful.

583
00:32:37.302 --> 00:32:40.044
He was kind of this, like,
beloved figure in the community.

584
00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:42.568
I don't know why
I'm saying all that.

585
00:32:42.655 --> 00:32:43.961
It's a lot of info.

586
00:32:45.484 --> 00:32:46.920
You guys wanna see
something weird?

587
00:32:47.008 --> 00:32:49.706
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Sure, yeah.

588
00:32:51.447 --> 00:32:53.971
Oh, wow.

589
00:32:54.058 --> 00:32:56.017
What is this?

590
00:32:57.105 --> 00:32:59.237
Yeah, it started as a hobby.

591
00:32:59.324 --> 00:33:01.544
I've always liked
making just, like,

592
00:33:01.674 --> 00:33:05.287
weird little sculptures,
ceramics, that kind of thing.

593
00:33:05.374 --> 00:33:08.551
But Etsy's a wild
place. You know?

594
00:33:08.638 --> 00:33:13.164
The custom, like, dog things
for people's pets and stuff?

595
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:14.531
It kind of sells like hot cakes.

596
00:33:16.037 --> 00:33:17.038
Did you hear that?

597
00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:20.128
- It's an old house, so.
- Right.

598
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.310
Has that door always
been like that?

599
00:33:29.354 --> 00:33:31.095
I don't know, I don't mark it.

600
00:33:32.227 --> 00:33:34.881
Do you mind if I check it out?

601
00:33:34.968 --> 00:33:35.968
Yeah.

602
00:33:36.405 --> 00:33:38.537
- Do you mind coming
with? Yeah, of course.

603
00:33:44.108 --> 00:33:46.197
- Do you wanna hold hands?
- Yeah, sure.

604
00:34:00.429 --> 00:34:01.734
- Nothing, right?
- Yep.

605
00:34:02.257 --> 00:34:07.131
Just, um, Christmas decorations and
a couple embarrassing old journals,

606
00:34:07.218 --> 00:34:09.655
I'm guessing. That
kind of thing.

607
00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:12.180
And a camera.

608
00:34:12.658 --> 00:34:14.399
No.
- Yeah.

609
00:34:14.921 --> 00:34:18.751
- The ninjas have been here.
- Holy shit.

610
00:34:19.926 --> 00:34:21.972
Little fucking snakes.

611
00:34:23.365 --> 00:34:25.193
Well, I've never been married,

612
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.501
but I never wanted to.
I just like my freedom.

613
00:34:29.588 --> 00:34:31.028
Well, I've had a
lot of love affairs,

614
00:34:31.112 --> 00:34:33.114
but then, um, who hasn't?

615
00:34:34.289 --> 00:34:36.291
I'm sorry, ma'am. What
was your question?

616
00:34:37.901 --> 00:34:39.468
I didn't ask one.

617
00:34:39.642 --> 00:34:41.470
- Oh.
- I was married once, James.

618
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.515
I regret it. Should
have stayed single.

619
00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:46.649
- My ex was a pain in the ass.
- Oh, boy. I'll say so.

620
00:34:46.736 --> 00:34:50.653
I was never married, but I did date a
woman for a long time. For 23 years.

621
00:34:51.175 --> 00:34:52.481
- Did you say 23?
- Yeah.

622
00:34:52.568 --> 00:34:53.917
- Of dating?
- Yes.

623
00:34:54.004 --> 00:34:56.615
We felt married. We just never
did the paperwork. But...

624
00:34:56.746 --> 00:34:58.146
Well, what happened?
Why did it end?

625
00:34:58.922 --> 00:35:00.532
Uh... He doesn't know.

626
00:35:00.619 --> 00:35:01.620
Oh, thank you, James.

627
00:35:02.012 --> 00:35:03.772
We got together when we were
young. We were, like, 15.

628
00:35:03.796 --> 00:35:05.537
I thought we were gonna
be together forever.

629
00:35:05.624 --> 00:35:08.714
And then, um, I don't know,
I guess we grew apart.

630
00:35:08.801 --> 00:35:11.108
One day I came home and
she said that was it.

631
00:35:11.239 --> 00:35:13.110
And so, uh, so I left.

632
00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:14.980
And then what?

633
00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:17.134
He hasn't talked to the
girl since she dumped him.

634
00:35:17.158 --> 00:35:21.771
- What?
- Shut up, James, please.

635
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.253
I've gone to her house
a lot to ask her.

636
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.908
I just, I don't even
know what I would say.

637
00:35:28.995 --> 00:35:30.625
So you just broke- You
just don't know why

638
00:35:30.649 --> 00:35:32.347
- she broke up
with you? I don't.

639
00:35:32.434 --> 00:35:34.305
- Don't you wanna know?
- I would love to know.

640
00:35:34.392 --> 00:35:36.438
Is it killing you?
- It's killing me.

641
00:35:37.178 --> 00:35:38.657
Well, this is what
we're doing today.

642
00:35:40.181 --> 00:35:41.921
Oh, no, no, no, no. I
can't do that today.

643
00:35:42.008 --> 00:35:44.924
Oh, no. We need to find out.
If we're gonna be partners,

644
00:35:45.447 --> 00:35:48.287
I need to know - what I'm dealing with.
- I don't think you need to know.

645
00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:49.900
Do you wanna be
my partner or not?

646
00:35:53.194 --> 00:35:57.198
Uh, this is delicious.
So what do you call it?

647
00:35:58.286 --> 00:35:59.417
Spaghetti.

648
00:36:28.577 --> 00:36:31.406
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hey, Theresa. How are ya?

649
00:36:33.538 --> 00:36:35.497
Seen you out here a few times.

650
00:36:36.759 --> 00:36:39.762
How's, uh, how's your baby?

651
00:36:39.892 --> 00:36:42.939
She is good. Her name is
Heather. She's almost one.

652
00:36:44.636 --> 00:36:48.074
Are you just here to
ask about the baby?

653
00:36:48.727 --> 00:36:51.295
I actually wanted
to ask you, um...

654
00:36:52.514 --> 00:36:56.648
how you felt about the, uh,
Ellen DeGeneres cancellation.

655
00:36:56.735 --> 00:36:58.415
I know what a big fan
you were of her show.

656
00:36:58.476 --> 00:37:00.609
Yes, I was very disappointed,
as you can imagine.

657
00:37:00.696 --> 00:37:02.350
I've been dying to ask you.

658
00:37:03.046 --> 00:37:05.566
I mean, all the red flags were
there. I should have known, but...

659
00:37:06.049 --> 00:37:07.833
Really fucked with my
afternoon schedules.

660
00:37:09.357 --> 00:37:10.357
What do you want?

661
00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:15.145
A friend encouraged me to come here
and ask you why you broke up with me.

662
00:37:15.711 --> 00:37:17.689
You know why I broke up - with you.
- I don't. Just tell me.

663
00:37:17.713 --> 00:37:18.820
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

664
00:37:18.844 --> 00:37:20.082
We talked about it so
many times. You know.

665
00:37:20.106 --> 00:37:21.426
We never talked.
I don't know why.

666
00:37:21.499 --> 00:37:24.372
I don't. If I knew, I
wouldn't be here, okay?

667
00:37:24.459 --> 00:37:26.417
And look, I-obviously,
we had our, our problems,

668
00:37:26.504 --> 00:37:29.333
but I mean, fuck, we
were together forever.

669
00:37:29.725 --> 00:37:30.726
We...

670
00:37:31.204 --> 00:37:32.858
We were supposed
to make it work.

671
00:37:32.945 --> 00:37:34.991
Yeah.
- That was our fucking deal.

672
00:37:35.078 --> 00:37:37.689
Yeah, I thought so too.

673
00:37:38.081 --> 00:37:41.171
But your version of being
together is just existing

674
00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:42.999
and I needed more from life.

675
00:37:43.434 --> 00:37:45.610
Right. I don't know
what that means.

676
00:37:45.697 --> 00:37:48.613
For years, we just did the
same things all the time.

677
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.311
We just went to the
same restaurants,

678
00:37:50.398 --> 00:37:52.071
and ate the same foods,
and sat in the same chairs,

679
00:37:52.095 --> 00:37:54.750
just to, like,
not feel anything.

680
00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.101
But at a certain point, I wanted
to feel things, good and bad.

681
00:37:58.188 --> 00:38:00.364
And I wanted you there with me.

682
00:38:00.843 --> 00:38:02.627
And I really tried.

683
00:38:02.714 --> 00:38:05.064
And you didn't wanna do that.
You never wanted to do that.

684
00:38:05.151 --> 00:38:07.023
You just wanted to fucking hide.

685
00:38:07.153 --> 00:38:10.026
You were just, like, stuck
and you refused to move.

686
00:38:10.156 --> 00:38:13.116
It's like you're so afraid of
feeling that you're already dead.

687
00:38:13.812 --> 00:38:16.685
I had a lot of shit to deal with,
and I've been working on it,

688
00:38:16.772 --> 00:38:18.948
and I have fought
to get better...

689
00:38:21.951 --> 00:38:25.084
but I don't think you wanted to
do that fight, so I had to leave.

690
00:38:27.086 --> 00:38:29.175
Well, what would you
do if I told you, uh,

691
00:38:29.262 --> 00:38:31.439
I got better too? What
would you say then?

692
00:38:31.569 --> 00:38:36.792
Yeah, well, then I would have
to ask you who that man is.

693
00:38:42.493 --> 00:38:44.321
This is an awkward
time to explain.

694
00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:46.454
Give it a shot.

695
00:38:46.932 --> 00:38:48.151
This is James.

696
00:38:48.412 --> 00:38:52.068
He follows me for a dark web
game where I'm being hunted

697
00:38:52.155 --> 00:38:54.026
for my life and
he keeps me safe.

698
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:56.768
Right.

699
00:38:58.466 --> 00:39:02.252
Tommy, you have to deal
with your emotions.

700
00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:04.559
Okay? You deserve
better than this.

701
00:39:04.646 --> 00:39:05.646
You know what?

702
00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:07.343
Thank you.

703
00:39:08.301 --> 00:39:10.391
Thank you. I
actually owe you one.

704
00:39:10.521 --> 00:39:12.393
'Cause he's awesome
and now he's mine.

705
00:39:13.176 --> 00:39:15.918
- Cool. Who is she?
I'm his partner.

706
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:19.095
And we're gonna go live
the fuck out of every day

707
00:39:19.182 --> 00:39:20.705
'cause we could
die at any moment.

708
00:39:20.792 --> 00:39:22.446
Yes. Yeah.

709
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.275
And congratulations
on your baby.

710
00:39:25.406 --> 00:39:27.538
You look, I mean, honestly,
you look stunning.

711
00:39:27.625 --> 00:39:29.714
I'm so sorry. This isn't
about-this isn't about me.

712
00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:31.368
I'm so sorry. I'm
really, I'm gonna go.

713
00:39:36.982 --> 00:39:37.983
Take care, Tommy.

714
00:39:39.507 --> 00:39:40.638
Yeah, you too.

715
00:39:43.685 --> 00:39:44.685
Bye, James.

716
00:39:58.917 --> 00:40:01.398
- Good try, buddy.
- Thanks, pal.

717
00:40:01.485 --> 00:40:03.705
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

718
00:40:03.792 --> 00:40:05.378
I thought that was
gonna be, like, funny,

719
00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:07.404
or I don't know what I
thought. That was awful.

720
00:40:07.491 --> 00:40:08.491
That was so awful.

721
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:09.991
It's okay. It's okay.
It needed to happen.

722
00:40:10.015 --> 00:40:11.234
- Really?
- Yes. I'm glad.

723
00:40:11.321 --> 00:40:14.193
Okay. Partners? I'm so sorry.

724
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.543
- Yes. Partners.
- Partners?

725
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.196
Okay, can we do
something fun, please?

726
00:40:17.283 --> 00:40:18.283
Yes, please.

727
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.640
Like, what's the most fun
thing you can think of?

728
00:40:43.396 --> 00:40:46.356
I am so glad we're playing
this game together.

729
00:40:47.139 --> 00:40:49.707
- I love dancing.
- It is so fun.

730
00:40:49.794 --> 00:40:52.623
I'm so bad at it.
- You're so good at it.

731
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.843
I'm better than you
but I'm really bad.

732
00:40:56.148 --> 00:40:59.238
All right, here you go.
I'm good. Thanks, bud.

733
00:41:01.763 --> 00:41:04.200
Um, I need to tell
you something.

734
00:41:04.287 --> 00:41:05.767
- Okay.
- Uh...

735
00:41:06.376 --> 00:41:08.857
My, uh, Dad didn't
die. I lied about that.

736
00:41:10.641 --> 00:41:13.426
He and my mom split
up when I was 10.

737
00:41:13.514 --> 00:41:16.691
It wasn't dramatic. Um,
no fights or anything.

738
00:41:16.865 --> 00:41:18.954
They just kind of drifted apart

739
00:41:19.041 --> 00:41:20.627
and neither of them
fought for the marriage.

740
00:41:20.651 --> 00:41:25.264
So now, um, my nightmare is
to be in that relationship,

741
00:41:25.351 --> 00:41:29.181
and I, uh, kind of end
up in these situations

742
00:41:29.268 --> 00:41:31.314
with overly dramatic people.

743
00:41:31.619 --> 00:41:36.101
Um, but then I get, like,
overwhelmed by their shit

744
00:41:36.188 --> 00:41:37.188
and I leave.

745
00:41:40.149 --> 00:41:41.716
Well, thanks for the honesty.

746
00:41:47.809 --> 00:41:52.117
When I was 10, my dad
vanished from the family.

747
00:41:52.814 --> 00:41:54.734
We were just hanging out
and everything was fine,

748
00:41:54.816 --> 00:41:56.992
and he and I stayed up
really late together.

749
00:41:57.079 --> 00:41:59.124
And we were playing
video games and laughing.

750
00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:01.736
And it was one of the most fun
nights I'd ever had with him.

751
00:42:02.563 --> 00:42:04.390
And then when I woke
up, he was gone.

752
00:42:04.477 --> 00:42:07.872
And we all looked for him
and we called the police.

753
00:42:09.874 --> 00:42:11.746
There was, like,
no trace of him.

754
00:42:17.186 --> 00:42:19.362
This has been an
interesting day.

755
00:42:19.449 --> 00:42:21.016
- Right?
- Yeah.

756
00:42:21.799 --> 00:42:26.238
It's been a fascinating,
uh, first day,

757
00:42:26.325 --> 00:42:28.980
of our partnership in
this game together.

758
00:42:29.241 --> 00:42:30.416
Do you wanna get outta here?

759
00:42:30.503 --> 00:42:33.245
Sure. Um, where to?

760
00:42:33.724 --> 00:42:36.118
I'm sorry I didn't want
James staying here,

761
00:42:36.205 --> 00:42:39.469
but I think he was content
with the hotel room I got him.

762
00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:42.472
Oh, he was really fired up
about that hotel room tonight.

763
00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:45.127
- He's excited for the time off.
- Yeah, and, and again,

764
00:42:45.214 --> 00:42:47.608
thank you for agreeing
to sleep like this.

765
00:42:47.695 --> 00:42:49.305
You know, I'm sorry
I'm old school.

766
00:42:49.392 --> 00:42:50.630
So I just thought it would be...

767
00:42:50.654 --> 00:42:51.654
Mom, stop... better if...

768
00:42:51.699 --> 00:42:53.091
- Stop, stop, Mom.
- Okay, okay.

769
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.920
So, again, you're welcome
to use the guest room

770
00:42:56.007 --> 00:42:59.402
if you want and have your
own bed. But it's up to you.

771
00:42:59.489 --> 00:43:01.709
That's really sweet of you.
But I obviously can't be

772
00:43:01.796 --> 00:43:03.164
away from your daughter
or I'm gonna...

773
00:43:03.188 --> 00:43:07.236
Oh, oh, right. Or you'll
get murdered. I forgot.

774
00:43:07.323 --> 00:43:08.846
Oh, you know what?

775
00:43:08.933 --> 00:43:11.849
I can't talk to you about
this. This is too weird.

776
00:43:12.154 --> 00:43:14.765
You know, you're an adult
so I assume you know

777
00:43:14.852 --> 00:43:16.941
what you're doing, so goodnight.

778
00:43:17.028 --> 00:43:20.771
And I hope no one
murders either of you.

779
00:43:26.298 --> 00:43:29.171
- I'm sorry about my Mom.
- No, she's great.

780
00:43:29.258 --> 00:43:31.260
This is great.

781
00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:33.523
- Thank God this is here.
- Yeah, for sure.

782
00:43:35.133 --> 00:43:36.308
Otherwise it would be weird.

783
00:43:37.745 --> 00:43:40.051
Yeah, it would be weird
without it. For sure.

784
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.100
All right.

785
00:43:47.711 --> 00:43:48.711
Good day.

786
00:43:48.973 --> 00:43:50.583
- Glad we met.
- Mm-hmm.

787
00:44:02.857 --> 00:44:03.858
Goodnight.

788
00:44:04.336 --> 00:44:06.861
Goodnight.

789
00:44:35.759 --> 00:44:37.065
Wake up.

790
00:44:37.152 --> 00:44:38.152
My God.

791
00:44:40.938 --> 00:44:43.462
- Are you a ninja?
- Production assistant, yeah.

792
00:44:44.376 --> 00:44:46.204
Why are you letting me see you?

793
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:48.163
Well, you're all of
our favorite character.

794
00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:50.469
We think you play
with a lot of heart.

795
00:44:50.556 --> 00:44:51.644
Thanks.

796
00:44:51.732 --> 00:44:54.212
You are not as safe
as you think you are.

797
00:44:54.299 --> 00:44:55.648
We wanted to warn you.

798
00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.827
Why do you keep saying "we"
when you're all by yourself?

799
00:45:16.278 --> 00:45:17.453
Hi, guys.

800
00:45:21.979 --> 00:45:25.156
You need to go. You
are not safe here.

801
00:45:25.287 --> 00:45:27.028
Yes, I am. I'm with Maddy.

802
00:45:27.898 --> 00:45:30.031
Shh.

803
00:45:30.814 --> 00:45:31.815
Look.

804
00:45:37.038 --> 00:45:41.564
Be careful. They're close.
Closer than you think.

805
00:46:01.236 --> 00:46:03.020
What the fuck?

806
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:09.461
Holy-Oh my God.

807
00:46:14.205 --> 00:46:15.772
- Where were you?
- I was getting water.

808
00:46:15.859 --> 00:46:18.253
We need to go to a
motel right now, Maddy.

809
00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.516
- Is this about my Mom?
- What?

810
00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:22.561
Is this about, like,
the sleeping situation?

811
00:46:22.648 --> 00:46:24.868
No, it's not about
your Mom, it's about...

812
00:46:25.477 --> 00:46:27.653
There was a bunch of
contortionist ninjas in here.

813
00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.568
They came out of there and he,

814
00:46:29.655 --> 00:46:32.615
there was, like, six of them in here
and they told me that it wasn't safe

815
00:46:32.702 --> 00:46:35.357
and I was in danger and we
needed to go someplace safer.

816
00:46:35.879 --> 00:46:37.620
We can just move the pillows.

817
00:46:39.622 --> 00:46:41.711
It's not about
the pillows. Okay.

818
00:46:46.759 --> 00:46:48.979
<i>♪ I had a dream ♪</i>

819
00:46:50.546 --> 00:46:53.157
<i>♪ She took my hand</i>

820
00:46:54.637 --> 00:46:58.902
<i>♪ Led me to a wonderland</i>

821
00:46:58.989 --> 00:47:00.077
How's this?

822
00:47:00.425 --> 00:47:02.732
Yeah, it's better,
right? Oh, great.

823
00:47:08.259 --> 00:47:09.652
Get up.

824
00:47:10.305 --> 00:47:11.915
No, I'm tired. I
wanna go to sleep.

825
00:47:12.002 --> 00:47:13.802
Please come out here -
just for a second. What?

826
00:47:13.874 --> 00:47:15.590
'Cause I can't. I can't go
out there alone. Please.

827
00:47:15.614 --> 00:47:17.007
No.
- Please.

828
00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.054
Thank you.

829
00:47:23.709 --> 00:47:25.233
- It's very nice.
It's really...

830
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.887
- It's very pretty.
It's pretty.

831
00:47:31.413 --> 00:47:34.764
Do you mind telling me why
you agreed to play the game?

832
00:47:35.504 --> 00:47:37.027
Why are you asking me this now?

833
00:47:37.114 --> 00:47:39.116
I'm just so curious.

834
00:47:44.165 --> 00:47:46.080
I was very bored.

835
00:47:47.385 --> 00:47:49.605
Like, dangerously bored.

836
00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.695
I felt like I needed to do something
extreme to shake things up.

837
00:47:53.696 --> 00:47:55.306
Why did you agree to do it?

838
00:47:57.656 --> 00:48:00.442
I guess I did it, uh,
'cause I was lonely.

839
00:48:00.572 --> 00:48:04.359
I felt so alone and,
uh, stuck in my routine.

840
00:48:04.446 --> 00:48:06.013
I didn't know how
to get out of it.

841
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.930
And as soon as that fucking
guy mentioned the loophole,

842
00:48:11.061 --> 00:48:12.236
a light bulb went off.

843
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.490
And I thought, "Well, that's
what I've been craving."

844
00:48:15.848 --> 00:48:18.721
I want to be around people
more, so I'll do that.

845
00:48:20.462 --> 00:48:21.637
And it's worked.

846
00:48:24.857 --> 00:48:27.860
Yeah. I think we sort of
did it for the same reason.

847
00:48:27.948 --> 00:48:30.733
I bet everybody who's played this
game has done it for the same reason.

848
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.126
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

849
00:48:33.475 --> 00:48:36.434
- Let's go to bed.
- Yeah, let's go to bed.

850
00:48:53.843 --> 00:48:57.064
Oh no. No. We're together.

851
00:49:02.634 --> 00:49:05.463
Hey, hey. Hey, man,
we're together.

852
00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:08.162
You can't do this, man.
Those aren't the rules.

853
00:49:08.292 --> 00:49:09.835
Sorry, maintenance. I
thought the room was empty.

854
00:49:09.859 --> 00:49:11.121
Oh, fucking bullshit with you.

855
00:49:11.208 --> 00:49:12.664
If you're maintenance
then why are you dressed

856
00:49:12.688 --> 00:49:13.950
like a Mario brother?

857
00:49:14.037 --> 00:49:15.037
Tommy?

858
00:49:15.473 --> 00:49:17.040
What do you mean Mario brother?

859
00:49:17.127 --> 00:49:18.713
You know what I mean.
Fucking look at you.

860
00:49:18.737 --> 00:49:20.304
Hey... No, I don't
know what you mean.

861
00:49:20.391 --> 00:49:23.786
I'm also the manager of this
motel. This is our uniform.

862
00:49:23.873 --> 00:49:26.634
Well, what are you, are you maintenance
or are you the fucking manager?

863
00:49:26.702 --> 00:49:27.746
Can't I be both?

864
00:49:27.877 --> 00:49:30.314
The, the uniform's
kind of ridiculous, so.

865
00:49:30.401 --> 00:49:32.969
Alright. I need to
improve the uniform.

866
00:49:34.014 --> 00:49:35.928
I'm sorry for
interrupting your sleep.

867
00:49:36.712 --> 00:49:39.497
Just stay out of our fucking
room, Mario. You hear me?

868
00:49:39.584 --> 00:49:40.803
We're together now.

869
00:49:49.377 --> 00:49:50.377
Well...

870
00:49:53.511 --> 00:49:54.904
if I'm Mario...

871
00:49:56.384 --> 00:49:58.473
who does that make you, huh?

872
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:01.998
Huh? King Koopa?

873
00:50:02.085 --> 00:50:03.173
What is King Koopa?

874
00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.436
What? You don't
know the characters?

875
00:50:05.523 --> 00:50:06.963
It's the bad guy
from Mario Brothers.

876
00:50:07.438 --> 00:50:09.634
- It's a really good reference.
- I'm not the bad guy. You're the bad guy.

877
00:50:09.658 --> 00:50:10.876
I'm the guy trying to survive.

878
00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:14.097
So in your scenario
that make you Mario.

879
00:50:14.184 --> 00:50:15.838
Yeah, he's Mario.

880
00:50:16.143 --> 00:50:18.943
And that doesn't mean I'm Princess
Peach, by the way. I'm fucking Luigi.

881
00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.193
You wanna be Luigi?
His twin brother?

882
00:50:24.107 --> 00:50:25.935
- Not the princess? Well, I...

883
00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:29.025
I mean, I guess I wasn't thinking
about the fact that it's like a bro...

884
00:50:29.112 --> 00:50:30.896
I guess <i>Mario Brothers.</i>
They are brothers.

885
00:50:30.983 --> 00:50:33.203
Yeah. I was just...
I want it to be clear

886
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:34.876
that it's, like, a
partnership and I feel like...

887
00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.860
Just stay out of our fucking
room. How about that, man?

888
00:50:37.947 --> 00:50:39.079
'Cause we're together.

889
00:50:48.914 --> 00:50:51.265
Oh! Oh my gosh.

890
00:50:51.352 --> 00:50:53.702
Fucking Christ.
- Oh my God.

891
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:55.051
- That was incredible.
- Yeah.

892
00:50:55.138 --> 00:50:56.811
Can you imagine if I
hadn't answered your ad?

893
00:50:56.835 --> 00:50:59.205
I'd just be asleep in bed, and
instead I'm yelling at some guy

894
00:50:59.229 --> 00:51:01.536
at three in the morning, calling
him like a Mario Brother.

895
00:51:01.623 --> 00:51:02.754
Okay, we gotta go.

896
00:51:02.841 --> 00:51:04.515
- What are you doing?
- We have to go obviously.

897
00:51:04.539 --> 00:51:06.715
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes, we do.

898
00:51:07.324 --> 00:51:09.544
It's just not safe
here. We have to go.

899
00:51:09.631 --> 00:51:11.198
Hey. No, no, no.

900
00:51:11.459 --> 00:51:13.200
- It's safe.
- It's not safe.

901
00:51:13.287 --> 00:51:15.593
Tommy. You're not serious.
Where would we even go?

902
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.204
No, no, no, no, no, we're not...

903
00:51:17.291 --> 00:51:19.989
- We're not doing that.
- We have to do it.

904
00:51:20.816 --> 00:51:23.035
Tommy, we just... We're fine.

905
00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:28.780
- Okay, you know what?
- I don't understand what's happening.

906
00:51:28.867 --> 00:51:31.392
Here's what's happening. Did
you see how close he was?

907
00:51:31.479 --> 00:51:33.109
- Yes.
- Did you see how aggressive he was?

908
00:51:33.133 --> 00:51:34.197
- Yes.
- I mean, he walked into our...

909
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:35.661
And we're fine 'cause
we're together.

910
00:51:36.875 --> 00:51:39.051
Right. But we have to
be, like, so perfect.

911
00:51:39.139 --> 00:51:40.140
Okay.

912
00:51:40.618 --> 00:51:42.292
It can't be as sloppy as it
was back at your house, right?

913
00:51:42.316 --> 00:51:44.361
Okay.
- It's gotta be 100 percent on.

914
00:51:44.448 --> 00:51:45.580
Okay.
- Or we're dead.

915
00:51:45.667 --> 00:51:48.452
Look, I really, really
like hanging with you.

916
00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:50.846
I feel like I have
been waiting for you.

917
00:51:50.933 --> 00:51:54.676
And now that I got you, -
I don't wanna die. Okay.

918
00:51:55.677 --> 00:51:56.677
I'm...

919
00:51:58.941 --> 00:52:01.683
I'm not going anywhere.

920
00:52:02.858 --> 00:52:03.989
Okay?

921
00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.601
- Okay, I'm not going anywhere.
- Good, then...

922
00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:08.579
So then we have to
spend the next...

923
00:52:08.603 --> 00:52:09.908
Great... two weeks or so...

924
00:52:09.995 --> 00:52:11.127
Great... like fucking this.

925
00:52:11.301 --> 00:52:13.434
I'm not worried about it, - are you?
- No, no.

926
00:52:14.261 --> 00:52:16.915
All right, well, I promise I'm
not going anywhere. I'm with you.

927
00:52:17.002 --> 00:52:19.657
- You're not getting rid of me.
- Okay, good. Then we're...

928
00:52:19.744 --> 00:52:21.268
- We're together.
- Yeah.

Holy shit.

945
00:53:22.111 --> 00:53:25.506
There's another
participant. Look. Look.

946
00:53:26.246 --> 00:53:29.814
I am also playing. I have
info that you will want.

947
00:53:34.645 --> 00:53:36.212
We don't wanna do that, right?

948
00:53:36.734 --> 00:53:38.040
I mean, we have to see.

949
00:53:38.954 --> 00:53:40.956
You wanna involve
somebody else? Now?

950
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.065
I feel like we've got a
pretty good thing going here.

951
00:53:44.089 --> 00:53:46.875
- I would rather not fuck it up.
- Right.

952
00:53:47.441 --> 00:53:50.008
I'm feeling really good.

953
00:53:50.618 --> 00:53:52.968
Like, kind of better than
I've felt in a while.

954
00:53:53.098 --> 00:53:54.448
Sorry, are you listening?

955
00:53:55.318 --> 00:53:59.191
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. I am.
There's another person playing.

956
00:53:59.279 --> 00:54:01.368
Hey, you're not
listening. It sucks.

957
00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:04.631
Maddy.

958
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.679
They could be playing the
game and they could be alone

959
00:54:08.766 --> 00:54:11.073
and in danger and we could help.

960
00:54:11.682 --> 00:54:14.206
Do you remember how we were
before we met each other?

961
00:54:14.294 --> 00:54:17.601
How fucking scary that
was? How lonely we were?

962
00:54:18.298 --> 00:54:21.779
Well, they could be like this
right now and we could help them.

963
00:54:22.824 --> 00:54:23.824
Right?

964
00:54:24.782 --> 00:54:27.176
Or they could help us.

965
00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:29.023
They could have information
that changes our game.

966
00:54:29.047 --> 00:54:31.398
We don't know. We have to try.

967
00:54:31.485 --> 00:54:33.530
And what is there?
What, what's the risk?

968
00:54:35.837 --> 00:54:38.361
Nothing. We have
each other. Right?

969
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.580
Right.

970
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:47.065
But this could be huge for us.
This could help our game so much.

971
00:55:04.648 --> 00:55:05.648
Sit down.

972
00:55:10.915 --> 00:55:14.658
- How many days you got left?
- I'm 11. She's, uh, 10.

973
00:55:18.749 --> 00:55:19.749
What's so funny?

974
00:55:20.621 --> 00:55:24.102
I don't wanna burst your bubble,
man, but the game is a joke.

975
00:55:24.189 --> 00:55:25.277
They're laughing at us.

976
00:55:26.627 --> 00:55:29.934
Oh, that's good to know.

977
00:55:30.413 --> 00:55:33.416
Right? It's a good
thing we met you.

978
00:55:33.503 --> 00:55:35.940
Yeah, that's probably everything
we need though. We should...

979
00:55:36.027 --> 00:55:37.309
You don't wanna know
how the game works?

980
00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:38.773
I do want to know
how the game works.

981
00:55:39.204 --> 00:55:40.944
Well, we're still playing. So I don't...
Of course, yeah. Please tell us.

982
00:55:40.945 --> 00:55:45.254
They pick a certain type of contestant.
You wanna know what the type is?

983
00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:46.690
- Analytical.
- Kinda cute.

984
00:55:46.777 --> 00:55:47.778
Hell no.

985
00:55:48.344 --> 00:55:50.999
They pick people really going
through shit. Like, struggling.

986
00:55:51.086 --> 00:55:53.088
Those are the ones
they take advantage of.

987
00:55:53.175 --> 00:55:56.265
The kind of people when other
people start to doubt them,

988
00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:57.962
they doubt themselves too.

989
00:56:00.008 --> 00:56:01.008
Right.

990
00:56:01.792 --> 00:56:04.099
Tom, I think we should go.

991
00:56:04.839 --> 00:56:06.449
You guys ready for
the other surprise?

992
00:56:06.536 --> 00:56:07.842
- Yeah.
- Not really.

993
00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.974
The show is a comedy.

994
00:56:10.714 --> 00:56:13.108
How's it a comedy? They're
trying to fucking kill us.

995
00:56:13.195 --> 00:56:14.588
That's it right there.

996
00:56:14.979 --> 00:56:18.330
The people trying to kill you are
dressed up just to get some laughs.

997
00:56:18.418 --> 00:56:21.508
Like me, I'm getting
hunted by a sumo wrestler

998
00:56:21.595 --> 00:56:23.727
and a guy dressed like Sinbad.

999
00:56:23.814 --> 00:56:25.033
A sumo wrestler?

1000
00:56:26.164 --> 00:56:28.384
And Sinbad, like, the comedian?

1001
00:56:28.471 --> 00:56:31.431
Yeah. And they're
dangerous as fuck too.

1002
00:56:31.518 --> 00:56:35.522
So the show's, like, um,
like, "Let's Make a Deal."

1003
00:56:35.609 --> 00:56:37.611
Is that the one
with Wayne Brady?

1004
00:56:37.698 --> 00:56:39.830
Yeah, it's actually- It's
a surprisingly good show.

1005
00:56:39.917 --> 00:56:42.398
- He's a great host.
- No surprises there at all.

1006
00:56:42.529 --> 00:56:44.008
That motherfucker is all talent.

1007
00:56:44.095 --> 00:56:45.096
I've never seen the show.

1008
00:56:45.183 --> 00:56:46.183
Yes.
- It's fun.

1009
00:56:46.533 --> 00:56:48.709
It's a good show.
- Okay, I'll check it out.

1010
00:56:48.796 --> 00:56:51.668
Do you even know the title
of the show you're on?

1011
00:56:51.755 --> 00:56:52.755
No, they never told me.

1012
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.192
- Did they tell you?
- No.

1013
00:56:55.716 --> 00:57:00.503
<i>DOG.</i> D, period, O, period,
G. <i>Delusions of Grandeur.</i>

1014
00:57:00.982 --> 00:57:03.506
You're stuck in a spider
web and don't even know it.

1015
00:57:03.593 --> 00:57:06.553
Charlie. Enough's
enough. It's time to go.

1016
00:57:07.249 --> 00:57:10.426
Bring your ass on. Now.
Gonna sit in the car.

1017
00:57:10.513 --> 00:57:14.256
That's my Dad. He's
on one. I gotta go.

1018
00:57:20.915 --> 00:57:22.351
I don't even know, uh...

1019
00:57:23.961 --> 00:57:27.748
- what to say.
- Yeah, um, I need to go home.

1020
00:57:28.444 --> 00:57:29.880
Yeah?
- Yeah.

1021
00:57:29.967 --> 00:57:31.007
Great, yeah. That's smart.

1022
00:57:31.578 --> 00:57:33.164
Just to get closer to the people
and places we're familiar with.

1023
00:57:33.188 --> 00:57:35.886
No um, I'm gonna, I think
I'm gonna go home alone.

1024
00:57:35.973 --> 00:57:38.280
What does that mean,
alone? Without me?

1025
00:57:38.367 --> 00:57:40.456
Yeah, I just need,
need the night at least

1026
00:57:40.543 --> 00:57:42.589
to kind of breathe.
Does that make sense?

1027
00:57:42.676 --> 00:57:46.418
Uh, emotionally, yeah. In terms
of the game, no, not at all.

1028
00:57:46.767 --> 00:57:48.812
Um, okay. How about this?

1029
00:57:48.899 --> 00:57:51.467
I can just drive you
wherever you want to go.

1030
00:57:51.554 --> 00:57:54.122
And maybe tomorrow
we can check in and,

1031
00:57:54.209 --> 00:57:55.863
and see where we're at kind of.

1032
00:57:56.124 --> 00:57:58.518
Or, or, or, sorry.

1033
00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.695
Or we could go back to the
motel and I'll just give you,

1034
00:58:01.782 --> 00:58:03.740
- I'll just give you
more space. Right.

1035
00:58:03.871 --> 00:58:05.437
The motel where we
sleep in the same bed

1036
00:58:05.525 --> 00:58:07.205
and we can't be more
than three feet apart.

1037
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:09.374
Well, we can... I can take, I
can take you wherever you want.

1038
00:58:09.398 --> 00:58:11.705
And I'll, I'll wait until
somebody's with you.

1039
00:58:12.619 --> 00:58:15.317
I think this is a really bad
idea and they could kill us.

1040
00:58:15.404 --> 00:58:18.625
Yeah, um...

1041
00:58:20.061 --> 00:58:22.106
I'm okay with you thinking that.

1042
00:58:28.417 --> 00:58:30.462
Maddy. Maddy, please.

1043
00:58:31.159 --> 00:58:36.947
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck
you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.

1044
00:58:37.034 --> 00:58:38.034
What is happening?

1045
00:58:38.558 --> 00:58:40.013
I don't know where the cameras
are, but I know they're here.

1046
00:58:40.037 --> 00:58:42.102
I know you guys have been
here. You're sneaky as fuck.

1047
00:58:42.126 --> 00:58:43.626
And I know that the
ninjas have been here.

1048
00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.869
I know the real name.
<i>Delusions of Grandeur.</i>

1049
00:58:45.956 --> 00:58:48.480
Fuck off. I got it. Very
clever. And guess what?

1050
00:58:48.568 --> 00:58:50.004
I don't care. And guess what?

1051
00:58:50.091 --> 00:58:51.851
You tried to get my
family not to believe me.

1052
00:58:51.919 --> 00:58:56.271
Well, I got James. And guess
what? He's become a friend.

1053
00:58:56.358 --> 00:58:58.316
Maybe even a friend for life.

1054
00:58:58.403 --> 00:58:59.598
- This is your brother.
- Yeah.

1055
00:58:59.622 --> 00:59:01.062
And if I find out
Madeline gets hurt,

1056
00:59:01.319 --> 00:59:05.323
I'm gonna fucking kill Andy
Samberg. Maddy dies, Samberg dies.

1057
00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:08.936
I'll turn that motherfucker into a
pinata. You understand what I'm saying?

1058
00:59:09.066 --> 00:59:11.808
I'll put his head
on a fucking stick.

1059
00:59:12.026 --> 00:59:15.464
He'll be a little pinata boy.

1060
00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:18.685
Ya fucked with the wrong
guy. I'll kill Andy Samberg.

1061
00:59:34.352 --> 00:59:35.352
Tommy.

1062
00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:40.924
You gotta go. There's a limo
outside waiting for you.

1063
00:59:41.533 --> 00:59:45.189
I don't want to go - to a limo right now.
- You don't have a choice.

1064
00:59:45.755 --> 00:59:47.539
Is this about...

1065
00:59:47.627 --> 00:59:50.455
me saying I would
murder Andy Samberg?

1066
00:59:50.542 --> 00:59:53.371
I don't know.'Cause I,
I would never do that.

1067
00:59:53.458 --> 00:59:55.373
I was just saying
it 'cause I was mad.

1068
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:58.420
- I don't know. You gotta go.
- Am I in trouble?

1069
00:59:58.507 --> 00:59:59.639
I don't know.

1070
01:00:01.466 --> 01:00:02.466
Let's go.

1071
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.220
Hi, Tommy.

1072
01:01:01.962 --> 01:01:02.962
Hi, Dad.

1073
01:01:04.965 --> 01:01:06.096
How's your mother?

1074
01:01:07.402 --> 01:01:10.535
She's good, yeah.
Mom's doing-Mary? Amy?

1075
01:01:11.058 --> 01:01:13.669
Good. Everybody's doing really
good in the last 30 years.

1076
01:01:13.756 --> 01:01:14.888
How are you?

1077
01:01:14.975 --> 01:01:17.412
Oh, real good.

1078
01:01:18.456 --> 01:01:19.456
Actually...

1079
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.940
Living in Cleveland, sober.

1080
01:01:24.027 --> 01:01:26.682
I'm sorry, uh, what, uh...

1081
01:01:28.292 --> 01:01:31.426
- What are you doing here?
- Right.

1082
01:01:31.513 --> 01:01:33.036
And I don't mean
to be rude, Dad.

1083
01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:35.517
I'm just trying to do the math
on what the fuck's happening.

1084
01:01:35.604 --> 01:01:37.780
I didn't expect to see you.

1085
01:01:37.867 --> 01:01:41.044
Well, yeah. Yeah.

1086
01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:45.875
I'm here to tell you...
that Madeline is unharmed.

1087
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:48.269
What are you talking about?

1088
01:01:51.054 --> 01:01:56.756
A few hours ago, a guy named
Wayne Brady knocked on my door.

1089
01:01:56.843 --> 01:01:59.149
Next thing I know...

1090
01:01:59.236 --> 01:02:02.022
I'm on a, a private jet.

1091
01:02:03.414 --> 01:02:05.373
Now I'm sitting here with you.

1092
01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:11.161
All right, Dad, well, this
was interesting but, um...

1093
01:02:11.858 --> 01:02:12.858
Tommy.

1094
01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:17.298
When I, I left,

1095
01:02:17.385 --> 01:02:19.300
when you and me
stayed up... Hey.

1096
01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:22.216
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey. No.

1097
01:02:22.303 --> 01:02:24.522
No. No.

1098
01:02:24.609 --> 01:02:26.611
Don't do this right now.

1099
01:02:27.351 --> 01:02:30.093
I can't do the big fucking
Dad talk right now.

1100
01:02:31.573 --> 01:02:36.447
What the fuck is going on
now? We're doing a Dad talk?

1101
01:02:36.534 --> 01:02:40.016
If I try to do a Dad talk, my
fucking head is gonna explode.

1102
01:02:40.103 --> 01:02:41.757
I understand.

1103
01:02:42.453 --> 01:02:44.107
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1104
01:02:45.543 --> 01:02:48.808
I have wanted to have
this moment with you

1105
01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:53.073
since the night
you fucking left.

1106
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:59.035
I've dreamt of this fucking
moment, man. But not now.

1107
01:02:59.122 --> 01:03:02.865
'Cause all I'm thinking about
now is Madeline's safety.

1108
01:03:02.952 --> 01:03:05.433
I like her so much.

1109
01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:11.700
I hope no one hurts
her, son. Or you.

1110
01:03:13.702 --> 01:03:18.141
And that you get to spend
your lives together.

1111
01:03:19.577 --> 01:03:23.886
Don't be like me. Don't
fuck up a good thing.

1112
01:03:27.585 --> 01:03:30.937
Hey, Dad.

1113
01:03:34.854 --> 01:03:37.857
Is this real-life right now?
Is this really happening?

1114
01:03:40.076 --> 01:03:41.382
I think so.

1115
01:03:46.126 --> 01:03:47.126
Okay.

1116
01:03:48.171 --> 01:03:49.171
Okay.

1117
01:03:51.566 --> 01:03:52.610
I love you, Dad.

1118
01:03:54.525 --> 01:03:55.700
Oh, man.

1119
01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.050
Mm-hmm.

1120
01:04:05.362 --> 01:04:06.973
- All right.
- Okay.

1121
01:04:13.631 --> 01:04:16.373
Been calling her for days.
Maybe she wants some space.

1122
01:04:23.511 --> 01:04:24.816
Hi.

1123
01:04:24.947 --> 01:04:27.558
Hey, I've been trying you
for days. Are you okay?

1124
01:04:27.863 --> 01:04:29.996
- I'm fine. I'm fine. You're
safe? Hundred percent?

1125
01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:31.083
Yeah.

1126
01:04:31.649 --> 01:04:35.305
Oh my God. - Come here, please.
- Tommy. I was lying.

1127
01:04:35.392 --> 01:04:37.220
I know, we've been over
that. I don't care.

1128
01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:38.526
No. Tommy, about the game.

1129
01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:42.530
Um. I'm not playing a game.

1130
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:46.621
- What are you talking about?
- I saw your ad and I...

1131
01:04:47.752 --> 01:04:51.887
was really bored and
lonely, and um...

1132
01:04:53.149 --> 01:04:57.197
I thought it was a joke.
I thought this was like...

1133
01:04:58.981 --> 01:05:01.679
roleplaying dating
or something...

1134
01:05:01.766 --> 01:05:03.594
What are you talking
about? What is this?

1135
01:05:03.725 --> 01:05:05.509
This is the truth. I...

1136
01:05:08.512 --> 01:05:10.514
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

1137
01:05:13.169 --> 01:05:15.476
- Who got to you?
- Nobody.

1138
01:05:15.563 --> 01:05:17.826
Who told you to say this?

1139
01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:20.046
Tommy, nobody.

1140
01:05:20.176 --> 01:05:23.266
Yeah. Was it
fucking Wayne Brady?

1141
01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:25.353
Did Wayne Brady come here
and tell you to say that?

1142
01:05:25.399 --> 01:05:27.096
That son of a fucking bitch.

1143
01:05:27.183 --> 01:05:28.837
I can assure you Wayne
Brady was not here.

1144
01:05:33.624 --> 01:05:35.322
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1145
01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:39.543
- They got my Mom.
Who got your Mom?

1146
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:41.502
Fucking hunters, Maddy.

1147
01:05:42.155 --> 01:05:45.810
Please, please keep up with me.
James, go as fast as you can!

1148
01:05:45.897 --> 01:05:48.161
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1149
01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:01.043
Ah!
- Ah, God.

1150
01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:05.787
Whoo. Hi. I, I'm
Ellen DeGeneres.

1151
01:06:06.483 --> 01:06:09.051
Sorry, but you don't really
look like Ellen DeGeneres to me.

1152
01:06:09.138 --> 01:06:12.098
You're probably a little
nervous, 'cause you're a big fan.

1153
01:06:12.185 --> 01:06:13.925
You've come to my taping before.

1154
01:06:14.143 --> 01:06:16.624
Yeah? You, you and, uh, your
ex-girlfriend, didn't you?

1155
01:06:16.711 --> 01:06:18.278
Yeah, we went. How
do you know that?

1156
01:06:18.365 --> 01:06:21.455
Well, get in the car, Tom. We
can talk about it in private.

1157
01:06:21.585 --> 01:06:23.587
But it's not a limousine.

1158
01:06:23.674 --> 01:06:25.894
Well, I, I like a Lincoln.

1159
01:06:25.981 --> 01:06:27.635
Why the fuck would
you like a Lincoln?

1160
01:06:27.722 --> 01:06:30.290
Come on, don't be a car snob.
Just, just get in the car.

1161
01:06:30.377 --> 01:06:32.074
- I'm not a car
snob. Tommy, please.

1162
01:06:32.161 --> 01:06:33.761
Why would you like a
Lincoln over a limo?

1163
01:06:35.817 --> 01:06:37.297
Get in the fucking car.

1164
01:06:37.645 --> 01:06:41.127
Hey, it's Ellen DeGeneres from TV.
She's giving away guest blocks.

1165
01:06:41.214 --> 01:06:42.843
Tommy! What the hell
happened to you, man?

1166
01:06:42.867 --> 01:06:44.391
I got hit in the face.

1167
01:06:44.478 --> 01:06:46.741
Oh, well, that's what
happens when you go too fast.

1168
01:06:46.828 --> 01:06:49.222
- Here, gimme your hand.
- You gotta keep up with me, man.

1169
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:51.528
Did you say Ellen
DeGeneres was here?

1170
01:06:51.615 --> 01:06:55.402
No, that wasn't Ellen DeGeneres.
It was a murderer, you asshole!

1171
01:06:55.532 --> 01:06:56.577
What?

1172
01:06:56.881 --> 01:06:59.362
- How's it look?
- Awful. Wipe your mouth.

1173
01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:00.729
Did you just call me an asshole?

1174
01:07:04.106 --> 01:07:05.106
Almost there.

1175
01:07:05.542 --> 01:07:07.892
Yeah, yeah, you said that
about ten minutes ago.

1176
01:07:07.979 --> 01:07:10.634
Okay, come on, come on. Please,
please, please. Hurry up.

1177
01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:18.032
What is this?

1178
01:07:18.294 --> 01:07:20.166
What does it look like?
It's an intervention.

1179
01:07:20.253 --> 01:07:22.124
- For me?
- No, for Mom.

1180
01:07:22.211 --> 01:07:23.667
We're all just facing
the wrong direction.

1181
01:07:23.691 --> 01:07:25.562
What the hell happened
to your tooth?

1182
01:07:25.649 --> 01:07:29.262
Oh, I got hit in the face by an
Ellen DeGeneres impersonator.

1183
01:07:29.392 --> 01:07:31.394
- Did it hurt?
- It was a pretty clean hit.

1184
01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:33.266
Yes, it hurt, but
it's kind of fine now.

1185
01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:35.050
Hi, Tom. I'm Lindsay.

1186
01:07:35.137 --> 01:07:37.531
I'm an interventionist and
I'd like to welcome you

1187
01:07:37.618 --> 01:07:39.141
to have a seat with
us for a while.

1188
01:07:39.446 --> 01:07:42.144
Hi, Lindsay. An inter... What
do you think? I'm a drug addict?

1189
01:07:42.231 --> 01:07:45.930
- Do you think I'm on drugs?
- No, it's about your mental health.

1190
01:07:46.017 --> 01:07:48.324
Or, I mean... We're not
really sure what it is.

1191
01:07:48.411 --> 01:07:51.197
Or maybe it's about attention
or, like, Theresa dumped you.

1192
01:07:51.284 --> 01:07:52.826
Okay, well, then how
about fucking this?

1193
01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:55.636
I saw Theresa and
we're good. We talked.

1194
01:07:56.506 --> 01:07:57.812
Oh, yeah?

1195
01:07:58.291 --> 01:08:01.032
Okay, well, maybe it's about
Dad never being around.

1196
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.338
I saw Dad.

1197
01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:04.819
He says hi to everybody.

1198
01:08:04.906 --> 01:08:08.953
Yeah, he lives in Cleveland.
He claims to be sober,

1199
01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.304
and he was pretty apologetic
about how he left.

1200
01:08:11.913 --> 01:08:13.349
You saw Dad?

1201
01:08:13.871 --> 01:08:16.047
Yeah, we were in a
limousine together.

1202
01:08:16.178 --> 01:08:20.313
Uh, Wayne Brady, um, I guess found
him and put him on a private jet.

1203
01:08:22.228 --> 01:08:24.752
Wayne Brady's friends with Dad?

1204
01:08:24.882 --> 01:08:26.643
I'm not sure if Wayne
Brady's friends with him,

1205
01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:28.669
but yeah, that's what Dad said.

1206
01:08:28.756 --> 01:08:31.411
There are a lot of people in
this room who really love you.

1207
01:08:31.498 --> 01:08:32.910
So why don't you
just sit for a while.

1208
01:08:32.934 --> 01:08:35.110
Hey, hey. Tommy?
- What?

1209
01:08:35.197 --> 01:08:36.197
Just sit down.

1210
01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:38.853
No offense, but this woman
is ridiculously expensive,

1211
01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:40.289
so please, thank you.

1212
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.555
Okay, we hired someone. We hired someone
to search for your dark web show.

1213
01:08:45.642 --> 01:08:47.209
They found nothing, honey.

1214
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:51.431
No thanks, buddy.

1215
01:08:53.389 --> 01:08:57.959
Well, maybe the person that
you hired is part of the game.

1216
01:08:58.089 --> 01:09:00.222
Have you brainiacs
ever thought of that?

1217
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:03.138
- Maybe it's a
setup. Oh, Tommy.

1218
01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:06.707
Tommy, we've been down
this road so many times.

1219
01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:10.406
And it's not the first time that you
thought the world was against you.

1220
01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:12.060
It just happens
to be the latest.

1221
01:09:13.322 --> 01:09:15.237
Honey, please accept it.

1222
01:09:21.852 --> 01:09:24.072
There's a ninja out
the window right now.

1223
01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:27.249
But don't look, they'll just run
away. It'll make me look worse.

1224
01:09:27.336 --> 01:09:28.336
There's no ninja.

1225
01:09:28.555 --> 01:09:30.395
What's that ninja doing?
Something really cool?

1226
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:33.168
Like, some back flips, some
kicks, or are they just chilling?

1227
01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:34.517
Just chilling.

1228
01:09:34.778 --> 01:09:36.215
That's disappointing.

1229
01:09:36.476 --> 01:09:39.305
Flips would've been cool.
- Okay, stop it. It's not funny.

1230
01:09:39.392 --> 01:09:41.002
Used to be funny.

1231
01:09:41.524 --> 01:09:44.310
- Uh, excuse me,
uh, Lindsay. Yes.

1232
01:09:44.397 --> 01:09:46.268
This is a lot to take in, um,

1233
01:09:46.355 --> 01:09:48.662
and, um, I'm just wondering
before I make my decision

1234
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:51.142
and we get to the letters,
if I can just take a minute.

1235
01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:55.146
Um, just to process and then I'm
happy to get in. Is that okay?

1236
01:09:55.756 --> 01:09:57.410
- Sure. Thank you.

1237
01:09:59.716 --> 01:10:02.458
Would you stop fucking
snacking and come with me, man?

1238
01:10:03.242 --> 01:10:04.852
That's all you ever say to me.

1239
01:10:04.939 --> 01:10:06.680
Stop snacking is
all I say to you?

1240
01:10:06.767 --> 01:10:08.247
- Yeah.
- That's not it.

1241
01:10:08.334 --> 01:10:10.292
Oh, it isn't? No.

1242
01:10:10.423 --> 01:10:11.989
Well, that went really bad.

1243
01:10:12.076 --> 01:10:14.644
I can't believe one tooth
can change a face so much.

1244
01:10:14.731 --> 01:10:16.342
- Right?
- Oh! There, he's running.

1245
01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:17.778
No, Tommy. Go, go, go, go, go.

1246
01:10:17.865 --> 01:10:21.129
Oh, goddamn it. I'm
calling the police.

1247
01:10:25.568 --> 01:10:29.268
Man, I gotta admit, this
has been a lot of fun.

1248
01:10:30.007 --> 01:10:31.835
I agree, man.

1249
01:10:31.922 --> 01:10:35.317
It's been great having you part
of it, James. It really has.

1250
01:10:35.404 --> 01:10:39.452
Also, you should know
my name's not James.

1251
01:10:39.539 --> 01:10:43.760
It's Walter.

1252
01:10:43.847 --> 01:10:46.981
- Is that true?
- Yes, that's true.

1253
01:10:47.068 --> 01:10:51.072
So why the fuck did you
tell me your name was James?

1254
01:10:51.159 --> 01:10:53.074
I didn't tell you
my name was James.

1255
01:10:53.161 --> 01:10:54.902
You just started
calling me James.

1256
01:10:54.989 --> 01:10:57.034
What?

1257
01:11:01.343 --> 01:11:04.868
- I just made up James?
- Yes, you did.

1258
01:11:05.391 --> 01:11:07.044
But don't worry about it, man.

1259
01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:08.307
Um... All right.

1260
01:11:08.829 --> 01:11:10.700
- We're friends now.
- Okay.

1261
01:11:11.048 --> 01:11:13.181
- Sorry I did that.
- So you should know my real name.

1262
01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.488
Yeah, I agree, man.

1263
01:11:15.575 --> 01:11:17.838
Sometimes my brain
does shit, man.

1264
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:24.366
Well, Walter, when I win this
fucking game, which I will...

1265
01:11:25.454 --> 01:11:27.674
I'd like to buy
you a place, man.

1266
01:11:27.761 --> 01:11:30.459
- For reals?
- Hundred percent. You deserve it, man.

1267
01:11:30.546 --> 01:11:31.958
- No, no.
- You're a great fucking guy.

1268
01:11:31.982 --> 01:11:33.182
- No, no, man.
- And I don't...

1269
01:11:33.419 --> 01:11:35.725
I don't want you - living like this.
- It's too much.

1270
01:11:35.812 --> 01:11:36.944
We're friends, right?

1271
01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:38.511
- Yeah.
- So I got you.

1272
01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:43.516
Listen to me.

1273
01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.476
Keep your head in the game, kid.

1274
01:11:47.563 --> 01:11:51.045
Remember what you're
doing. Remember the rules.

1275
01:11:51.132 --> 01:11:55.266
You can win. Don't quit.

1276
01:11:59.793 --> 01:12:00.707
Okay.

1277
01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:02.143
- You're good?
- Yeah.

1278
01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:03.492
Okay. Me too.

1279
01:12:03.666 --> 01:12:06.669
Okay.

1280
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.237
Boy, we are a toothless
bunch of old dudes, ain't we?

1281
01:12:26.994 --> 01:12:29.736
Excuse me. Have you seen the guy
I was with, with the big beard?

1282
01:12:36.569 --> 01:12:39.136
What the fuck is
going on? James!

1283
01:12:42.226 --> 01:12:43.226
Walter!

1284
01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.060
Have you seen the guy I was
with, with the big beard?

1285
01:13:00.767 --> 01:13:02.072
It's a dark web reality show.

1286
01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:03.813
I'm being hunted, I
just can't be alone.

1287
01:13:03.987 --> 01:13:06.686
So that's why I came here, cause
my family doesn't trust me. So...

1288
01:13:16.043 --> 01:13:18.175
I'd prefer to go home,
believe me, you know,

1289
01:13:18.262 --> 01:13:20.656
but it's only a couple
more days, so...

1290
01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:27.924
So I've got about 24 hours
left, and then I win.

1291
01:13:28.011 --> 01:13:30.100
That's it. That's it.

1292
01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:44.898
Wake up.

1293
01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:51.339
It's day 30, is it over?

1294
01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:53.210
- Did I win?
- No.

1295
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:55.256
Then why are you here?

1296
01:13:55.778 --> 01:13:58.378
We're just here to give you
instructions on the ending of the game.

1297
01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.260
Okay.

1298
01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:03.361
You can just bring out the other
ninjas, I know they're here.

1299
01:14:11.315 --> 01:14:12.316
Hey.

1300
01:14:12.839 --> 01:14:14.841
So what happens now,
how does it end?

1301
01:14:14.928 --> 01:14:17.496
- There will be a limo.
- You need to get in it.

1302
01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:19.062
It will take you to the ending.

1303
01:14:19.759 --> 01:14:21.761
That's it. Those are
the instructions.

1304
01:14:21.848 --> 01:14:23.327
Okay, where's the limo?

1305
01:14:23.414 --> 01:14:26.156
I don't know, but, uh, they
did tell me to tell you

1306
01:14:26.243 --> 01:14:29.116
that you need to leave
this area to find the limo.

1307
01:14:29.203 --> 01:14:31.988
I have to leave here? Why?

1308
01:14:32.075 --> 01:14:33.903
They feel like the
audience is getting bored

1309
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:35.644
watching you sleeping
under this bridge.

1310
01:14:35.731 --> 01:14:37.448
They feel like it's getting
a little depressing.

1311
01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:38.560
Really?

1312
01:14:38.647 --> 01:14:40.736
It is a comedy, remember?

1313
01:14:40.823 --> 01:14:42.703
Well, I'm sorry I'm not
being more entertaining,

1314
01:14:42.738 --> 01:14:44.479
but people are
trying to murder me.

1315
01:14:44.566 --> 01:14:47.830
We get it. But they do want
a more exciting ending.

1316
01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:49.852
That's why we got rid of
Walter in the first place.

1317
01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:52.443
They felt like your
relationship was too repetitive.

1318
01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:55.925
You took Walter? You
didn't hurt him, did you?

1319
01:14:56.012 --> 01:14:59.799
No, he's sleeping in a motel right
now until you either win or die.

1320
01:14:59.886 --> 01:15:01.670
He's quite happy
with the set up.

1321
01:15:01.757 --> 01:15:03.585
Well I'm sure he is.

1322
01:15:03.672 --> 01:15:07.241
We recommend that you find
someone getting outta here

1323
01:15:07.328 --> 01:15:08.808
and you follow them.

1324
01:15:09.199 --> 01:15:11.158
- The limo will find you.
- Okay.

1325
01:15:12.115 --> 01:15:13.203
Maybe her?

1326
01:15:42.798 --> 01:15:45.409
Sir, why'd you follow me?

1327
01:15:45.496 --> 01:15:47.063
Oh, I wasn't following you.

1328
01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:49.588
We just both happened to
be doing the same thing.

1329
01:15:58.901 --> 01:16:01.034
How are you doing, Mr. Walcott?

1330
01:16:02.862 --> 01:16:05.386
Boy, you have been one
hell of a contestant.

1331
01:16:05.473 --> 01:16:07.083
Excuse me, can you see him?

1332
01:16:08.084 --> 01:16:09.869
Stop talking to me.

1333
01:16:11.522 --> 01:16:14.438
Mm-hmm. Woah.

1334
01:16:14.525 --> 01:16:16.745
I'm not alone. We're together.

1335
01:16:16.832 --> 01:16:20.880
You will be. And
I'm a patient man.

1336
01:16:20.967 --> 01:16:22.367
Do you mind if I
ask you a question?

1337
01:16:23.447 --> 01:16:24.535
Go ahead.

1338
01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:28.844
Have you figured it out?

1339
01:16:30.672 --> 01:16:33.762
That this whole game
was set up just for you?

1340
01:16:35.068 --> 01:16:37.505
All that Michael Jackson shit.

1341
01:16:38.637 --> 01:16:41.422
You and your dad
playing video games,

1342
01:16:41.683 --> 01:16:43.903
and your ex with
Ellen DeGeneres.

1343
01:16:49.865 --> 01:16:51.388
So then who are you?

1344
01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:55.566
I think maybe you watched a
few too many westerns, huh?

1345
01:18:30.139 --> 01:18:31.139
Hi.

1346
01:18:32.228 --> 01:18:34.274
- Me again.
- Hi.

1347
01:18:34.578 --> 01:18:36.755
So, you been having fun?

1348
01:18:36.885 --> 01:18:38.844
Did you just ask if
I was having fun?

1349
01:18:38.931 --> 01:18:40.889
Um... yes?

1350
01:18:40.976 --> 01:18:43.805
No! I'm not having fun!

1351
01:18:43.892 --> 01:18:44.892
Okay.

1352
01:18:45.328 --> 01:18:48.070
This has been a goddamn
nightmare, Andy Samberg.

1353
01:18:48.157 --> 01:18:50.594
Well I'm sorry to hear
that. But truth be told...

1354
01:18:51.465 --> 01:18:54.305
since I last saw you, things haven't
been that great for me either. So...

1355
01:18:55.948 --> 01:18:58.820
Been on a little
bit of a bender.

1356
01:18:58.907 --> 01:19:01.301
- You've been on a bender?
Lot of ups and downs.

1357
01:19:01.562 --> 01:19:04.434
Currently in a big down.

1358
01:19:05.653 --> 01:19:10.136
In a big down. Thus,
me, back here with you.

1359
01:19:10.571 --> 01:19:12.573
- For a little money gig.
- What do you even want?

1360
01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:13.855
You know what, you're
actually totally right.

1361
01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:15.141
I'm gonna keep this moving

1362
01:19:15.271 --> 01:19:17.708
so I can get paid, you can
be on your way, and I can...

1363
01:19:18.971 --> 01:19:20.668
<i>♪ Take it back to
squeaky street. ♪</i>

1364
01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:22.801
I'm just kidding!

1365
01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:24.890
No more of that.

1366
01:19:25.238 --> 01:19:26.911
Just getting my money so I can
pay everyone back that I owe.

1367
01:19:26.935 --> 01:19:28.434
If you're watching,
I'm just joking around,

1368
01:19:28.458 --> 01:19:30.243
you're gonna get your
money. Here we go.

1369
01:19:31.635 --> 01:19:34.073
Thomas Walcott.
Smelly, no tooth.

1370
01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.988
Doesn't really say
that, I was just joking.

1371
01:19:36.075 --> 01:19:39.121
Gotta keep it light. Congratulations.
You have made it to the limo.

1372
01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:42.298
But the game is not
over. You have a choice.

1373
01:19:42.385 --> 01:19:45.519
Do you want to continue
playing, or end it now,

1374
01:19:45.606 --> 01:19:48.565
and return to your home
safely but receive no money?

1375
01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:54.441
- I'm gonna do it.
- Really?

1376
01:19:54.528 --> 01:19:58.488
Yeah, really. I've come this far,
I need to finish what I started.

1377
01:19:58.575 --> 01:20:00.882
Why would you...
You know what? Fine.

1378
01:20:00.969 --> 01:20:03.058
I get paid more if you
keep going, so great.

1379
01:20:03.667 --> 01:20:05.582
He wants to keep going.
Let's keep going.

1380
01:20:06.975 --> 01:20:09.848
Jesus fucking Christ.

1381
01:20:12.372 --> 01:20:14.532
Hey uh, would you do me a
favor? Roll your window down.

1382
01:20:14.591 --> 01:20:16.637
You're pretty ripe.

1383
01:20:17.768 --> 01:20:21.860
Thank you.

1384
01:20:32.435 --> 01:20:35.961
Okay. Good luck, man.

1385
01:20:56.546 --> 01:20:57.591
Hey, boo.

1386
01:20:58.287 --> 01:21:01.160
Can I talk to you? I got
some information about Maddy.

1387
01:21:01.247 --> 01:21:04.467
Hey, Tommy, come
this way. Towards me.

1388
01:21:04.554 --> 01:21:06.643
- We're friends with Charlie.
- Sinbad...

1389
01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:08.254
- Come here.
- Fuck.

1390
01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:09.908
Tommy.

1391
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:23.008
Tommy!

1392
01:21:35.542 --> 01:21:37.500
Holy shit.

1393
01:21:37.848 --> 01:21:40.764
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

1394
01:21:48.685 --> 01:21:51.601
I won! I won! I won!

1395
01:22:01.481 --> 01:22:06.268
Where are the
fucking guys? I won!

1396
01:22:10.664 --> 01:22:14.233
It's been 30 days. The limo
picked me up, I made it!

1397
01:22:14.842 --> 01:22:16.931
I told you when we
were sitting here,

1398
01:22:17.062 --> 01:22:19.368
your game was
beatable, and it was.

1399
01:22:19.455 --> 01:22:21.109
And I beat you!

1400
01:22:21.631 --> 01:22:24.983
You tried to break me, but
you failed at that too.

1401
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:27.550
You actually made me stronger.

1402
01:22:27.637 --> 01:22:29.857
You wanna know why?
'Cause I learned things.

1403
01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:33.252
First of all, I got
over my ex. Check mark.

1404
01:22:33.904 --> 01:22:36.995
Second of all, I saw
my Dad. Thank you.

1405
01:22:37.082 --> 01:22:38.909
Fucking check mark.

1406
01:22:39.388 --> 01:22:42.652
Third of all, I met a new
woman and she's excellent.

1407
01:22:42.739 --> 01:22:44.002
So how's this?

1408
01:22:45.655 --> 01:22:51.357
I know that I won, and you
owe me a million dollars,

1409
01:22:51.444 --> 01:22:55.143
and I'm not leaving
until you bring it to me.

1410
01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:08.069
Just gimme my goddamn money
so I can get on with my life

1411
01:23:08.156 --> 01:23:09.679
for fuck's sake.

1412
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:27.132
Congratulations. You
survived 30 days.

1413
01:23:27.219 --> 01:23:31.701
- You are our first winner!
- You won our game!

1414
01:23:31.788 --> 01:23:34.356
How does it feel to be a winner?

1415
01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:38.839
Pretty good. Pretty good.

1416
01:23:38.926 --> 01:23:40.188
Stoked for you, Tommy.

1417
01:23:40.319 --> 01:23:43.583
Thanks, man. You helped me
a lot. All you guys did.

1418
01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:46.107
I mean, not you, Samurai.

1419
01:23:46.194 --> 01:23:49.241
I just met you. And
you remember this guy.

1420
01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:52.983
You beat me, ya prick.

1421
01:23:53.984 --> 01:23:57.597
Even that was scary.

1422
01:23:57.684 --> 01:23:58.684
What is this?

1423
01:23:59.207 --> 01:24:02.254
This is Danish Kroner. It's
the currency of Greenland.

1424
01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:05.822
Thank you. And I'm really
glad you didn't kill me.

1425
01:24:05.909 --> 01:24:07.563
You're very welcome.

1426
01:24:07.650 --> 01:24:09.130
I think I learned
from this game,

1427
01:24:09.217 --> 01:24:11.872
I'm ready to shake things
up. Let's try new things.

1428
01:24:11.959 --> 01:24:13.091
Yeah.

1429
01:24:13.178 --> 01:24:18.008
I fucking won! I won the game!

1430
01:24:19.271 --> 01:24:22.143
Fuck yeah!

1431
01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:27.844
Wow! What a fucked-up game!

1432
01:24:36.723 --> 01:24:41.031
<i>Was it dangerous? Uh, yeah,
it actually really was.</i>

1433
01:24:41.597 --> 01:24:43.991
Was it worth it? Hmm.

1434
01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:49.823
You bet your ass it was. 'Cause
we're talking a million dollars.

1435
01:24:50.389 --> 01:24:51.433
And I won.

1436
01:24:52.826 --> 01:24:55.524
So I'd like to thank you
guys for fucking nothing,

1437
01:24:55.611 --> 01:24:57.831
because you didn't
believe in me,

1438
01:24:57.961 --> 01:25:00.094
and you were wrong
and I was right.

1439
01:25:00.181 --> 01:25:02.009
And you all have
egg on your face.

1440
01:25:02.096 --> 01:25:03.736
So what do you have
to say for yourselves?

1441
01:25:04.751 --> 01:25:08.668
I'm glad you fixed your tooth,
'cause it really looked terrible.

1442
01:25:08.755 --> 01:25:11.671
Comedically.
- I preferred it before. So you won.

1443
01:25:12.193 --> 01:25:16.154
So does that, does that mean you're,
you're a millionaire now, honey?

1444
01:25:16.763 --> 01:25:21.071
Uh, obviously with this game,
there's always twists and turns

1445
01:25:21.159 --> 01:25:22.638
and it's happened
with the currency.

1446
01:25:22.725 --> 01:25:23.876
What's the twist
with the currency?

1447
01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:25.182
Yeah, how much-
How much did you...

1448
01:25:25.206 --> 01:25:27.208
I wonder what the twist
is with the currency.

1449
01:25:27.295 --> 01:25:28.862
Are you a millionaire or not?

1450
01:25:28.949 --> 01:25:29.993
- Yeah, so. Of course.

1451
01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:32.668
Yeah, so the way they're doing
the payment on this one is uh,

1452
01:25:32.692 --> 01:25:37.349
it's four grand a month for,
I think it's 250 months.

1453
01:25:37.697 --> 01:25:40.265
And it's in Greenlandic currency.
So I don't know the conversion.

1454
01:25:40.352 --> 01:25:42.658
That's very interesting.
Greenlandic currency.

1455
01:25:42.745 --> 01:25:44.747
I wonder where that
terrible idea came from.

1456
01:25:44.834 --> 01:25:46.836
Not so bad! That's,
like, 12 years.

1457
01:25:46.967 --> 01:25:49.012
Yeah. Okay well,
that's it. I'm done.

1458
01:25:49.143 --> 01:25:51.145
Uh, Wayne Brady, big fan.

1459
01:25:51.232 --> 01:25:52.233
- Yeah.
- Aw, thank you.

1460
01:25:52.712 --> 01:25:54.211
Uh, you wanna grab lunch or
something, or are you down?

1461
01:25:54.235 --> 01:25:56.213
- Yeah, yeah, no I'm down.
- Great. Awesome. Yeah, cool.

1462
01:25:56.237 --> 01:25:58.283
Thank you. Alright, well
good to see everybody.

1463
01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:01.503
It's just like a lot,
you know what I mean?

1464
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:03.331
Hey, thank you.

1465
01:26:03.505 --> 01:26:06.552
<i>So, what are you gonna tell
Maddy if she asks about the game?</i>

1466
01:26:06.639 --> 01:26:08.206
<i>I'm gonna tell her the truth.</i>

1467
01:26:08.336 --> 01:26:11.383
The game's over.
Time to move on.

1468
01:26:12.558 --> 01:26:16.039
Alright. Here goes
nothing. Now or never.

1469
01:26:16.126 --> 01:26:17.780
Yeah, here goes nothing.

1470
01:26:19.347 --> 01:26:20.783
You want me to come with you?

1471
01:26:21.219 --> 01:26:24.047
No, no. I wanna do it
on my own. But thanks.

1472
01:26:24.134 --> 01:26:25.851
I'll see you back at the
apartment, though, all right?

1473
01:26:25.875 --> 01:26:27.181
Come on, hug it up.

1474
01:26:27.747 --> 01:26:29.942
Thanks. I'll see you back - at home, okay?
- Yeah, I'll see you at home.

1475
01:26:29.966 --> 01:26:31.620
