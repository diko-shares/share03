00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.138
<i>Thebes, City of the Living,</i>

2
00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.475
<i>crown jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.</i>

3
00:01:17.436 --> 00:01:21.690
<i>Home of Imhotep,</i>
<i>Pharaoh's high priest,</i>

4
00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:23.734
<i>keeper of the dead.</i>

5
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:29.073
<i>Birthplace of Anck-Su-Namun,
Pharaoh's mistress.</i>

6
00:01:29.698 --> 00:01:32.326
<i>No other man was allowed to touch her.</i>

7
00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:58.977
<i>But for their love,
they were willing to risk life itself.</i>

8
00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.707
What are you doing here?

9
00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:41.853
Who has touched you?

10
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.486
Imhotep?

11
00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.613
My priest!

12
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.048
Pharaoh's bodyguards.

13
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:16.304
- You must go! Save yourself!
- No.

14
00:03:16.387 --> 00:03:18.597
Only you can resurrect me!

15
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.853
I won't leave you! Get away from me!

16
00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:28.607
You shall live again!

17
00:03:29.941 --> 00:03:31.985
I will resurrect you!

18
00:03:35.322 --> 00:03:38.950
My body is no longer his temple!

19
00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:50.003
<i>To resurrect Anck-Su-Namun,</i>

20
00:03:50.087 --> 00:03:54.549
<i>Imhotep and his priests
broke into her crypt and stole her body.</i>

21
00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:56.843
<i>They raced deep into the desert,</i>

22
00:03:56.927 --> 00:03:59.721
<i>taking Anck-Su-Namun's corpse
to Hamunaptra, City of the Dead...</i>

23
00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:01.056
HAMUNAPTRA - 1290 B.C.

24
00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.142
<i>...ancient burial site
for the sons of pharaohs</i>

25
00:04:04.226 --> 00:04:07.312
<i>and resting place for the wealth of Egypt.</i>

26
00:04:10.148 --> 00:04:11.233
<i>For his love,</i>

27
00:04:11.316 --> 00:04:15.445
<i>Imhotep dared the gods' anger
by going deep into the city,</i>

28
00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:19.199
<i>where he took the black</i> Book of the Dead
<i>from its holy resting place.</i>

29
00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.285
<i>Anck-Su-Namun's soul</i>

30
00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:24.704
<i>had been sent to the dark underworld,</i>

31
00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:30.252
<i>her vital organs removed
and placed in five sacred canopic jars.</i>

32
00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:02.283
<i>Anck-Su-Namun's soul</i>
<i>had come back from the dead...</i>

33
00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:07.371
<i>...but Pharaoh's bodyguards
had followed Imhotep and stopped him</i>

34
00:05:07.454 --> 00:05:09.039
<i>before the ritual could be completed.</i>

35
00:05:22.928 --> 00:05:26.765
<i>Imhotep's priests</i>
<i>were condemned to be mummified alive.</i>

36
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.364
<i>As for Imhotep,</i>
<i>he was condemned to endure the Hom-Dai,</i>

37
00:05:42.448 --> 00:05:44.783
<i>the worst of all ancient curses.</i>

38
00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:48.454
<i>One so horrible,
it had never before been bestowed.</i>

39
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:31.120
<i>He was to remain sealed</i>
<i>inside his sarcophagus,</i>

40
00:06:31.704 --> 00:06:34.332
<i>be undead for all of eternity.</i>

41
00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:37.335
<i>The Magi would never allow him
to be released,</i>

42
00:06:37.418 --> 00:06:41.839
<i>for he would arise a walking disease,
a plague upon mankind,</i>

43
00:06:41.923 --> 00:06:45.176
<i>an unholy flesh-eater
with the strength of ages,</i>

44
00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.806
<i>power over the sands,
and the glory of invincibility.</i>

45
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.713
HAMUNAPTRA - 1923

46
00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:26.384
<i>For 3,000 years,</i>
<i>men and armies fought over this land,</i>

47
00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:28.970
<i>never knowing what evil lay beneath it.</i>

48
00:07:45.944 --> 00:07:48.989
<i>And for 3,000 years,</i>
<i>we, the Magi,</i>

49
00:07:49.072 --> 00:07:51.658
<i>the descendants
of Pharaoh's sacred bodyguards,</i>

50
00:07:51.742 --> 00:07:52.576
<i>kept watch.</i>

51
00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:08.300
You just got promoted.

52
00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:17.559
Steady!

53
00:08:17.642 --> 00:08:21.897
- You're with me on this one, right?
- Oh, your strength gives me strength.

54
00:08:23.357 --> 00:08:24.691
Steady!

55
00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:31.239
Wait! Wait for me!

56
00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:34.076
Steady!

57
00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:40.665
Fire!

58
00:10:05.708 --> 00:10:07.793
Run, Beni! Run!

59
00:10:07.877 --> 00:10:10.588
Get inside! Get inside!

60
00:10:11.797 --> 00:10:17.219
Hey! Don't you close that door!
Don't you close that door!

61
00:11:16.945 --> 00:11:20.949
<i>You will die. You will die.</i>

62
00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:52.981
The Creature remains undiscovered.

63
00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:56.149
And what of this one?

64
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.252
- Should we kill him?
- No.

65
00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:17.629
The desert will kill him.

66
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.052
CAIRO, EGYPT - 3 YEARS LATER

67
00:12:35.314 --> 00:12:37.399
Sacred stones,

68
00:12:37.983 --> 00:12:40.610
sculpture and aesthetics,

69
00:12:41.403 --> 00:12:46.867
Socrates, Seth, volume one, volume two,

70
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.912
and volume three. And... Tu...

71
00:12:51.663 --> 00:12:55.334
Tuthmosis? What are you doing here?

72
00:12:56.251 --> 00:12:57.878
T. T, T, T...

73
00:12:57.961 --> 00:12:59.046
T.

74
00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:03.300
I'm going to put you
where you belong.

75
00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:21.568
Help.

76
00:13:50.137 --> 00:13:50.971
Oops.

77
00:13:51.514 --> 00:13:54.809
What... How...

78
00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:58.437
Um...

79
00:13:59.688 --> 00:14:01.524
Oh, look at this!

80
00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:04.568
Sons of the pharaohs!

81
00:14:04.652 --> 00:14:08.864
Give me frogs! Flies! Locusts!

82
00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:10.825
Anything but you!

83
00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:14.495
Compared to you,
the other plagues were a joy!

84
00:14:14.578 --> 00:14:16.914
I am so very sorry. It was an accident.

85
00:14:16.997 --> 00:14:21.627
My girl, when Rameses destroyed Syria,
that was an accident.

86
00:14:21.711 --> 00:14:26.090
You are a catastrophe! Look at my library!

87
00:14:26.674 --> 00:14:28.467
Why do I put up with you?

88
00:14:29.427 --> 00:14:32.388
Well, you put up with me because I can...

89
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:35.266
I can read and write Ancient Egyptian,

90
00:14:35.349 --> 00:14:38.436
and I can...
I can decipher hieroglyphics and hieratic,

91
00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:42.648
and, well, I am the only person
within 1,000 miles

92
00:14:42.732 --> 00:14:45.818
who knows how to properly code
and catalog this library, that's why.

93
00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:49.529
I put up with you because your father
and mother were our finest patrons.

94
00:14:49.612 --> 00:14:50.572
That's why!

95
00:14:51.281 --> 00:14:52.741
Allah rest their souls.

96
00:14:54.117 --> 00:14:58.580
Now, I don't care how you do it,
I don't care how long it takes,

97
00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:00.665
straighten up this <i>meshiver!</i>

98
00:15:14.637 --> 00:15:15.764
Hello?

99
00:15:41.873 --> 00:15:42.999
Abdul?

100
00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:46.503
Mohammed?

101
00:15:49.672 --> 00:15:50.757
Bob?

102
00:16:11.611 --> 00:16:14.697
Have you no respect for the dead?

103
00:16:16.323 --> 00:16:17.783
Of course I do.

104
00:16:17.866 --> 00:16:20.828
But sometimes
I'd rather like to join them.

105
00:16:20.911 --> 00:16:23.205
Well, I wish you would do it
sooner rather than later

106
00:16:23.288 --> 00:16:25.541
before you ruin my career
the way you've ruined yours.

107
00:16:25.624 --> 00:16:28.877
- Now, get out.
- My dear, sweet baby sister.

108
00:16:28.961 --> 00:16:31.004
I'll have you know

109
00:16:31.088 --> 00:16:34.091
that, at this precise moment,
my career is on a high note.

110
00:16:34.174 --> 00:16:37.553
High note, ha! Oh, Jonathan, please,
I'm really not in the mood for you.

111
00:16:37.636 --> 00:16:40.013
I've just made a bit of a mess
in the library,

112
00:16:40.097 --> 00:16:43.267
and the Bembridge scholars have
rejected my application form again.

113
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.061
They say I don't have enough experience
in the field.

114
00:16:49.815 --> 00:16:52.860
You'll always have me, old mum.

115
00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.533
Besides, I have just the thing
to cheer you up.

116
00:16:59.616 --> 00:17:02.953
Oh, no, Jonathan,
not another worthless trinket.

117
00:17:03.036 --> 00:17:06.164
If I have to take one more piece of junk
to the curator to try and...

118
00:17:06.248 --> 00:17:07.583
sell for you.

119
00:17:11.378 --> 00:17:12.671
Where did you get this?

120
00:17:13.964 --> 00:17:16.550
On a dig down in Thebes.

121
00:17:17.342 --> 00:17:18.927
My whole life,
I've never found anything, Evy.

122
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:21.179
Please tell me I've found something.

123
00:17:25.767 --> 00:17:28.145
- Jonathan.
- Yes?

124
00:17:29.187 --> 00:17:30.814
I think you've found something.

125
00:17:35.277 --> 00:17:36.445
You see the cartouche there?

126
00:17:36.528 --> 00:17:39.823
It's the official royal seal
of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.

127
00:17:40.532 --> 00:17:42.033
- Perhaps.
- Two questions.

128
00:17:42.116 --> 00:17:45.286
Who the hell was Seti the First,
and was he rich?

129
00:17:45.369 --> 00:17:47.830
He was the second pharaoh
of the 19th dynasty,

130
00:17:47.914 --> 00:17:49.165
said to be the wealthiest pharaoh
of them all.

131
00:17:49.248 --> 00:17:51.208
Good. That's good. I like this fellow.

132
00:17:51.292 --> 00:17:53.836
- I like him very much.
- I've already dated the map.

133
00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.212
It's almost 3,000 years old.

134
00:17:55.296 --> 00:17:59.634
And if you look at the hieratic just here,
well, it's Hamunaptra.

135
00:17:59.717 --> 00:18:04.931
Dear God, don't be ridiculous.
We're scholars, not treasure hunters.

136
00:18:05.014 --> 00:18:08.351
Hamunaptra's a myth
told by ancient Arab storytellers

137
00:18:08.434 --> 00:18:10.144
to amuse Greek and Roman tourists.

138
00:18:10.227 --> 00:18:11.604
Yes, yes, I know all the silly blather

139
00:18:11.687 --> 00:18:14.440
about the city being protected
by the curse of a mummy nonsense,

140
00:18:14.523 --> 00:18:17.193
but my research has led me to believe

141
00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:19.278
that the city itself
may have actually existed.

142
00:18:19.362 --> 00:18:23.449
- Are we talking about "the" Hamunaptra?
- Yes. The City of the Dead.

143
00:18:23.532 --> 00:18:26.577
Where the earliest pharaohs were said
to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.

144
00:18:26.661 --> 00:18:29.830
Yes, yes, in a big,
underground treasure chamber.

145
00:18:29.914 --> 00:18:32.667
Oh, come on. Everybody knows the story.

146
00:18:33.209 --> 00:18:36.003
The entire necropolis was rigged to sink
into the sand on Pharaoh's command.

147
00:18:36.087 --> 00:18:38.881
A flick of a switch, and the whole place
would disappear beneath the sand dunes,

148
00:18:38.965 --> 00:18:40.091
taking the treasure with it.

149
00:18:40.174 --> 00:18:43.427
As the Americans would say,
it's all fairy tales and hokum.

150
00:18:43.511 --> 00:18:46.055
Oh, my goodness! Look at that!

151
00:18:52.895 --> 00:18:53.729
You've burnt it!

152
00:18:53.813 --> 00:18:55.773
You've burned off the part
with the lost city.

153
00:18:55.856 --> 00:18:57.817
It's for the best, I'm sure.

154
00:18:58.484 --> 00:19:02.446
Many men have wasted their lives
in the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra.

155
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:03.990
No one's ever found it.

156
00:19:04.824 --> 00:19:07.368
Most have never returned.

157
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.286
Come, come! Step over the threshold.

158
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.206
Welcome to Cairo Prison, my humble home.

159
00:19:13.289 --> 00:19:16.042
You told me that you got it
on a dig down in Thebes.

160
00:19:16.126 --> 00:19:17.752
Yeah, well, I was mistaken.
You lied to me.

161
00:19:17.836 --> 00:19:20.213
I lie to everybody.
What makes you so special?

162
00:19:20.296 --> 00:19:22.298
- I am your sister.
- That just makes you more gullible.

163
00:19:22.382 --> 00:19:24.217
Jonathan, you stole it from a drunk
at the local casbah.

164
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.636
Picked his pocket, actually,
so I don't think it's a very good...

165
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.887
Will you stop being so ridiculous?

166
00:19:27.971 --> 00:19:29.889
Now what exactly
is this man in prison for?

167
00:19:29.973 --> 00:19:31.391
Well, this I did not know.

168
00:19:31.975 --> 00:19:34.978
But when I heard that you were coming,
I asked him that myself.

169
00:19:35.061 --> 00:19:36.730
And what did he say?

170
00:19:36.813 --> 00:19:39.816
He said he was just looking
for a good time.

171
00:19:45.655 --> 00:19:48.575
- This is the man that you stole it from?
- Yes, exactly.

172
00:19:48.658 --> 00:19:50.535
So why don't we just go
sniff out a spot of tiffin...

173
00:19:50.618 --> 00:19:51.578
Who are you?

174
00:19:53.496 --> 00:19:55.081
- And who's the broad?
- "Broad"?

175
00:19:55.165 --> 00:19:59.502
I'm just a local sort of missionary chap,
spreading the good word and all that,

176
00:19:59.586 --> 00:20:02.255
- but this is my sister, Evy.
- How do you do?

177
00:20:03.006 --> 00:20:06.176
- Oh, well. Guess she's not a total loss.
- I beg your pardon.

178
00:20:07.761 --> 00:20:08.595
I'll be back in a moment.

179
00:20:08.678 --> 00:20:12.098
- Ask him about the box.
- We have found... Uh...

180
00:20:12.182 --> 00:20:17.145
Hello. Excuse me.
Um, we both found your puzzle box,

181
00:20:17.228 --> 00:20:19.397
and we've come to ask you about it.

182
00:20:19.939 --> 00:20:22.317
- No.
- No?

183
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.987
No. You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.

184
00:20:27.405 --> 00:20:30.075
How do you know
that the box pertains to Hamunaptra?

185
00:20:30.158 --> 00:20:32.368
Because that's where I was
when I found it. I was there.

186
00:20:34.162 --> 00:20:36.580
But how do we know
that's not a load of pig's wallow?

187
00:20:36.663 --> 00:20:39.124
- You know... Do I know you?
- No, no, no.

188
00:20:39.208 --> 00:20:41.919
I've just got one of those faces.

189
00:20:42.711 --> 00:20:44.671
Damn.

190
00:20:46.715 --> 00:20:49.802
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

191
00:20:51.136 --> 00:20:53.305
- Yeah, I was there.
- You swear?

192
00:20:53.388 --> 00:20:54.723
- Every damn day.
- No, I didn't mean that...

193
00:20:54.807 --> 00:20:58.811
I know what you meant. I was there.
Seti's place. City of the Dead.

194
00:20:59.686 --> 00:21:02.523
Could you tell me
how to get there?

195
00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:08.195
I mean, the exact location.

196
00:21:08.278 --> 00:21:10.906
- You want to know?
- Well, yes.

197
00:21:10.989 --> 00:21:13.242
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

198
00:21:16.829 --> 00:21:19.206
Then get me the hell out of here!

199
00:21:22.376 --> 00:21:23.627
Do it, lady!

200
00:21:28.674 --> 00:21:31.176
- Where are they taking him?
- To be hanged.

201
00:21:31.844 --> 00:21:34.680
Apparently, he had a very good time.

202
00:21:40.102 --> 00:21:42.354
I will give you £100
to save this man's life.

203
00:21:42.437 --> 00:21:46.191
Madame, I would pay £100
just to see him hang.

204
00:21:46.275 --> 00:21:48.026
- Two... £200.
- Proceed!

205
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.153
£300.

206
00:21:51.196 --> 00:21:53.073
Any last requests, pig?

207
00:21:53.657 --> 00:21:56.160
Yeah. Loosen the knot and let me go.

208
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.539
Of course we don't let him go!

209
00:22:04.041 --> 00:22:06.419
Five-hundred pounds!

210
00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.381
And what else? I'm a very lonely man.

211
00:22:14.844 --> 00:22:16.387
No!

212
00:22:23.269 --> 00:22:25.855
His neck did not break.

213
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.861
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Now we must watch him strangle to death.

214
00:22:41.162 --> 00:22:42.955
He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

215
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.250
- You lie.
- I would never!

216
00:22:46.334 --> 00:22:49.420
Are you telling me
this filthy, godless son of a pig

217
00:22:49.503 --> 00:22:51.505
knows where to find the City of the Dead?

218
00:22:51.589 --> 00:22:52.423
- Yes!
- Truly?

219
00:22:52.506 --> 00:22:55.009
Yes! And if you cut him down,
we will give you...

220
00:22:58.763 --> 00:23:00.765
- Ten percent.
- Fifty percent.

221
00:23:00.848 --> 00:23:02.558
- Twenty.
- Forty.

222
00:23:02.642 --> 00:23:04.018
- Thirty!
- Twenty-five.

223
00:23:04.101 --> 00:23:05.394
Ah! Deal.

224
00:23:07.355 --> 00:23:08.940
Cut him down!

225
00:23:21.035 --> 00:23:23.871
GIZA PORT - CAIRO

226
00:23:24.997 --> 00:23:26.707
Do you really think
he's going to show up?

227
00:23:26.791 --> 00:23:29.417
Yes, undoubtedly,
knowing my luck.

228
00:23:30.043 --> 00:23:32.754
He may be a cowboy, but I know the breed.
His word is his word.

229
00:23:32.837 --> 00:23:37.384
Well, personally I think he's filthy,
rude, a complete scoundrel.

230
00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:39.719
- I don't like him one bit.
- Anyone I know?

231
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:43.264
Oh.

232
00:23:44.224 --> 00:23:45.058
Um...

233
00:23:45.767 --> 00:23:46.601
Hello.

234
00:23:46.685 --> 00:23:49.896
Smashing day for the start
of an adventure, eh, O'Connell?

235
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.148
Yeah. Yeah, smashing.

236
00:23:52.232 --> 00:23:55.568
Oh, no, no,
I'd never steal from a partner, partner.

237
00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.531
That reminds me.
No hard feelings about the...

238
00:23:59.614 --> 00:24:01.700
Oh, no, no. Happens all the time.

239
00:24:01.783 --> 00:24:04.869
Mr. O'Connell, can you look me in the eye
and guarantee me

240
00:24:04.953 --> 00:24:07.914
that this isn't all
some kind of a flimflam?

241
00:24:07.998 --> 00:24:11.376
- Because if it is, I am warning you...
- You're warning me?

242
00:24:11.459 --> 00:24:13.044
Lady, let me put it this way,

243
00:24:13.128 --> 00:24:15.463
my whole damn garrison
believed in this so much

244
00:24:15.547 --> 00:24:18.591
that without orders, they marched
halfway across Libya and into Egypt

245
00:24:18.675 --> 00:24:20.802
to find that city. And when we got there,

246
00:24:20.885 --> 00:24:23.471
all we found was sand and blood.

247
00:24:24.639 --> 00:24:25.598
Let me get your bags.

248
00:24:31.396 --> 00:24:33.523
Yes, yes, you're right.

249
00:24:33.606 --> 00:24:36.735
Filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel.
Nothing to like there at all.

250
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:41.239
Bright good morning to all.

251
00:24:41.322 --> 00:24:43.074
Oh, no. What are you doing here?

252
00:24:43.658 --> 00:24:47.203
I'm here to protect my investment,
thank you very much.

253
00:25:08.682 --> 00:25:11.894
Quit playing with your glasses
and cut the deck, would you, Burns?

254
00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:14.521
Without my glasses I can't see
the deck to cut it, can I, Dave?

255
00:25:14.605 --> 00:25:17.483
O'Connell, sit down, sit down.
We could use another player.

256
00:25:17.566 --> 00:25:19.610
I only gamble with my life,
never my money.

257
00:25:19.693 --> 00:25:20.652
Never?

258
00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:24.281
What if I was to bet you $500, says
we get to Hamunaptra before you?

259
00:25:24.364 --> 00:25:27.451
- You're looking for Hamunaptra?
- Damn straight we are.

260
00:25:27.534 --> 00:25:30.245
- And who says we are?
- He does.

261
00:25:30.329 --> 00:25:33.999
Well, how about it? Is it a bet?

262
00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:40.005
- All right, you're on.
- What makes you so confident, sir?

263
00:25:40.089 --> 00:25:41.548
What makes you?

264
00:25:41.632 --> 00:25:43.675
Well, we got us a man
who's actually been there.

265
00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:45.302
Oh, what a coincidence,
because O'Connell...

266
00:25:45.385 --> 00:25:49.640
Whose play is it?
Is it my play? I thought I just, um...

267
00:25:49.723 --> 00:25:52.976
Gentlemen, we got us a wager.
Good evening, Jonathan.

268
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:53.977
Night.

269
00:26:10.244 --> 00:26:12.162
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

270
00:26:12.246 --> 00:26:15.249
The only thing that scares me,
Mr. O'Connell, are your manners.

271
00:26:15.332 --> 00:26:18.127
Still angry
about that kiss, huh?

272
00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.086
Well, if you call that a kiss.

273
00:26:25.842 --> 00:26:30.763
Did I miss something?
Are we... Are we going into battle?

274
00:26:30.847 --> 00:26:32.348
Lady, there's something out there.

275
00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:35.393
Something underneath that sand.

276
00:26:35.476 --> 00:26:38.729
Yes, well,
I'm hoping to find a certain artifact.

277
00:26:38.813 --> 00:26:41.691
A book, actually.
My brother thinks there's treasure.

278
00:26:42.733 --> 00:26:46.320
- What do you think's out there?
- In a word? Evil.

279
00:26:46.863 --> 00:26:49.949
The Bedouin and the Tuaregs believe
that Hamunaptra is cursed.

280
00:26:50.032 --> 00:26:53.870
Oh, look, I don't believe
in fairy tales and hokum, Mr. O'Connell,

281
00:26:53.953 --> 00:26:57.165
but I do believe one of the most famous
books in history is buried out there.

282
00:26:57.248 --> 00:26:58.916
The <i>Book of Amun-Ra.</i>

283
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.045
It contains within it all the secret
incantations of the old kingdom.

284
00:27:03.129 --> 00:27:06.007
It's what first interested me in Egypt
when I was a child.

285
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:09.427
It's why I came here.
Sort of a life's pursuit.

286
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.929
And the fact that they say
that it's made out of pure gold

287
00:27:12.013 --> 00:27:13.681
makes no never mind to you?

288
00:27:13.764 --> 00:27:16.058
- Right?
- You know your history.

289
00:27:16.142 --> 00:27:17.226
I know my treasure.

290
00:27:20.104 --> 00:27:20.938
Um...

291
00:27:22.231 --> 00:27:23.232
By the way,

292
00:27:24.692 --> 00:27:26.110
why did you kiss me?

293
00:27:26.194 --> 00:27:28.946
I was about to be hanged.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

294
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:37.705
What? What'd I say?

295
00:27:42.543 --> 00:27:46.755
What a surprise.
My good friend, you're alive!

296
00:27:46.838 --> 00:27:51.259
- I was so very, very worried.
- Well, if it ain't my little buddy, Beni.

297
00:27:51.843 --> 00:27:53.803
- I think I'll kill you.
- Think of my children.

298
00:27:53.887 --> 00:27:55.597
You don't have any children.

299
00:27:56.348 --> 00:27:57.974
- Someday I might.
- Shut up!

300
00:27:58.058 --> 00:28:00.435
So, you're the one
who's leading the Americans.

301
00:28:00.518 --> 00:28:02.646
I might have known.
So, what's the scam, Beni?

302
00:28:02.729 --> 00:28:04.564
You take them out
into the middle of the desert,

303
00:28:04.648 --> 00:28:07.734
- and then you leave them to rot?
- Unfortunately, no.

304
00:28:08.276 --> 00:28:09.861
These Americans are smart.

305
00:28:09.945 --> 00:28:13.323
They pay me only half now,
half when I get them back to Cairo.

306
00:28:13.406 --> 00:28:16.534
- So this time I must go all the way.
- Them's the breaks, huh?

307
00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:20.330
You never believed
in Hamunaptra, O'Connell.

308
00:28:21.081 --> 00:28:24.960
Why are you going back?

309
00:28:25.043 --> 00:28:28.129
You see that girl? She saved my neck.

310
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:36.930
You always did have
more balls than brains.

311
00:28:41.017 --> 00:28:43.061
Yeah. Goodbye, Beni.

312
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.278
O'Connell!

313
00:29:03.999 --> 00:29:05.333
George Bembridge...

314
00:29:06.501 --> 00:29:08.712
In 1860...

315
00:29:11.798 --> 00:29:14.633
Hmm. 1865, was...

316
00:29:17.511 --> 00:29:18.470
Was...

317
00:29:18.554 --> 00:29:21.557
Oh, for heaven's sake, girl,
it wasn't that good of a kiss, anyway.

318
00:29:35.946 --> 00:29:38.532
Where is the map?

319
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.161
It's... It's... There.

320
00:29:42.244 --> 00:29:44.913
And the key? Where is the key?

321
00:29:45.539 --> 00:29:48.125
The key? The key? What key?

322
00:29:48.208 --> 00:29:49.043
Evelyn!

323
00:30:05.392 --> 00:30:07.561
The map! The map!
I forgot the map!

324
00:30:07.645 --> 00:30:10.856
Relax. I'm the map. It's all up here.

325
00:30:10.939 --> 00:30:11.982
Oh, that's comforting.

326
00:30:20.783 --> 00:30:22.576
- The key!
- Evy?

327
00:30:43.554 --> 00:30:45.139
Hold on to this.

328
00:31:13.876 --> 00:31:15.044
Can you swim?

329
00:31:15.128 --> 00:31:17.880
Of course I can swim,
if the occasion calls for it.

330
00:31:17.964 --> 00:31:20.299
Trust me. It calls for it.

331
00:31:44.073 --> 00:31:46.117
O'Connell! O'Connell!
What are we going to do?

332
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.201
What are we going to do?

333
00:31:47.285 --> 00:31:49.412
- Wait here! I'll go get help!
- Right!

334
00:32:12.017 --> 00:32:13.727
Americans.

335
00:32:28.575 --> 00:32:30.869
I say, bloody good show, chaps!

336
00:32:32.204 --> 00:32:33.663
And did I panic?

337
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:35.916
I think not.

338
00:32:47.928 --> 00:32:50.388
Get them out of the water!
Get them out of the water!

339
00:32:50.472 --> 00:32:53.225
Come on, doggies!
Give them a smack, would you?

340
00:32:56.728 --> 00:32:58.814
This is a messed-up country.

341
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.904
We've lost everything!
All of our tools, all the equipment!

342
00:33:06.571 --> 00:33:07.614
All my clothes!

343
00:33:07.697 --> 00:33:09.366
O'Connell!

344
00:33:10.659 --> 00:33:13.537
Hey! O'Connell!

345
00:33:14.162 --> 00:33:17.916
It looks to me
like I've got all the horses!

346
00:33:18.458 --> 00:33:19.668
Hey, Beni!

347
00:33:19.751 --> 00:33:23.797
Looks to me like
you're on the wrong side of the river!

348
00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.257
Yeah.

349
00:33:42.773 --> 00:33:44.817
I only want four! Four!

350
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.695
I only want four, not a whole bloody herd!

351
00:33:47.778 --> 00:33:51.031
O'Connell! Can you believe the cheek?

352
00:33:51.115 --> 00:33:52.867
Will you just pay the man?

353
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.119
Oh, for heaven's sake.

354
00:33:55.828 --> 00:33:58.247
Can't believe the price of these fleabags.

355
00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:01.458
Yes, happy. Very good.

356
00:34:01.542 --> 00:34:05.588
You probably could've got them for free.
All we had to do was give him your sister.

357
00:34:05.671 --> 00:34:06.630
Yes.

358
00:34:07.423 --> 00:34:09.091
Awfully tempting, wasn't it?

359
00:34:16.056 --> 00:34:17.224
Awfully.

360
00:34:42.875 --> 00:34:44.376
Never did like camels.

361
00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.255
Filthy buggers.
They smell, they bite, they spit.

362
00:34:48.339 --> 00:34:51.926
- Disgusting.
- I think they're adorable.

363
00:34:54.678 --> 00:34:55.512
<i>♪ Oh, baby ♪</i>

364
00:36:43.118 --> 00:36:45.412
This one is strong.

365
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.757
Good morning, my friend.

366
00:37:13.523 --> 00:37:15.067
What the hell we doing?

367
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.152
Patience, my good <i>barat'm.</i> Patience.

368
00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:22.074
Remember our bet, O'Connell.
First one to the city, 500 cash bucks.

369
00:37:22.157 --> 00:37:24.576
A hundred of them bucks is yours
if you help us win that bet.

370
00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:26.203
Oh, my pleasure.

371
00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:30.207
Hey, O'Connell. Nice camel.

372
00:37:34.669 --> 00:37:35.504
Get ready for it.

373
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:40.550
- For what?
- We're about to be shown the way.

374
00:37:53.979 --> 00:37:57.691
- Will you look at that?
- Can you believe it?

375
00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:59.318
Hamunaptra.

376
00:37:59.401 --> 00:38:00.945
Here we go again.

377
00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:36.355
So long, Beni.

378
00:38:40.234 --> 00:38:41.610
That serves you right.

379
00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:10.639
Go, Evy! Go!

380
00:39:51.346 --> 00:39:52.680
Do they know something we don't?

381
00:39:54.182 --> 00:39:57.602
They are led by a woman.
What does a woman know?

382
00:39:58.353 --> 00:40:01.981
That's a statue of Anubis.
Its legs go deep underground.

383
00:40:02.065 --> 00:40:03.900
According to Bembridge scholars,

384
00:40:03.983 --> 00:40:06.027
that's where we'll find
a secret compartment

385
00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.196
containing the golden <i>Book of Amun-Ra.</i>

386
00:40:10.573 --> 00:40:12.951
Jonathan, you're meant to catch
the sun with that.

387
00:40:15.787 --> 00:40:19.082
- So, what are these old mirrors for?
- Ancient mirrors.

388
00:40:19.749 --> 00:40:21.834
It's an ancient Egyptian trick.
You'll see.

389
00:40:23.127 --> 00:40:25.672
Uh... Here, this is for you.

390
00:40:27.966 --> 00:40:31.344
Go ahead. It's something
I borrowed off our American brethren.

391
00:40:31.427 --> 00:40:34.764
I thought you might like it,
you might need it for when you're...

392
00:40:34.847 --> 00:40:38.101
Yeah. What are you looking at?

393
00:40:48.652 --> 00:40:51.780
Hey, look for bugs. I hate bugs.

394
00:40:52.322 --> 00:40:54.366
Do you realize
we're standing inside a room

395
00:40:54.449 --> 00:40:57.119
no one has entered in over 3,000 years?

396
00:40:57.202 --> 00:41:00.372
What is that god-awful stench?

397
00:41:03.417 --> 00:41:04.293
Oh.

398
00:41:10.674 --> 00:41:13.760
And then there was light.

399
00:41:15.512 --> 00:41:17.806
Hey, that is a neat trick.

400
00:41:17.889 --> 00:41:20.726
Oh, my God. It's a <i>sah-netjer.</i>
What?

401
00:41:20.809 --> 00:41:21.977
A preparation room.

402
00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.355
- Preparation for what?
- For entering the afterlife.

403
00:41:26.815 --> 00:41:29.693
Mummies, my good son.
This is where they made the mummies.

404
00:41:40.829 --> 00:41:42.205
What the...

405
00:41:46.168 --> 00:41:47.252
What was that?

406
00:41:47.878 --> 00:41:50.839
Sounds like... bugs.

407
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:55.427
- He said bugs.
- What do you mean, bugs? I hate bugs!

408
00:42:12.651 --> 00:42:13.986
The legs of Anubis.

409
00:42:15.363 --> 00:42:19.408
The secret compartment should be hidden
somewhere inside here.

410
00:42:44.975 --> 00:42:46.894
You scared the bejesus
out of us, O'Connell.

411
00:42:46.977 --> 00:42:47.812
Likewise.

412
00:42:48.854 --> 00:42:51.065
- Hey, that's my tool kit.
- No, I don't think so.

413
00:42:51.148 --> 00:42:54.318
Okay. Perhaps I was mistaken.

414
00:42:56.237 --> 00:42:57.822
Well, have a nice day, gentlemen.

415
00:42:57.905 --> 00:42:59.490
We have a lot of work
to be getting along with.

416
00:42:59.573 --> 00:43:03.035
- Push off! This is our dig site.
- We got here first.

417
00:43:05.246 --> 00:43:07.415
This here's our statue, friend.

418
00:43:07.498 --> 00:43:10.376
I don't see your name written on it, pal.

419
00:43:10.459 --> 00:43:16.006
Yes, well, there's only four of you
and 15 of me.

420
00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:18.467
Your odds are not so great, O'Connell.

421
00:43:19.009 --> 00:43:21.762
- I've had worse.
- Yeah, me, too.

422
00:43:23.305 --> 00:43:26.892
Oh, look, for goodness' sake,
let's be nice, children.

423
00:43:27.435 --> 00:43:30.688
If we're going to play together,
we must learn to share.

424
00:43:32.731 --> 00:43:34.775
There are other places to dig.

425
00:43:40.155 --> 00:43:42.907
According to these hieroglyphics,
we're underneath the statue.

426
00:43:43.658 --> 00:43:45.493
We should come up right between his legs.

427
00:43:45.577 --> 00:43:47.454
When those damn Yanks go to sleep...

428
00:43:47.537 --> 00:43:48.788
- No offense.
- None taken.

429
00:43:49.372 --> 00:43:50.582
...we'll dig our way up
and steal that book

430
00:43:50.665 --> 00:43:51.666
right out from under them.

431
00:43:51.749 --> 00:43:53.877
Are you sure we can find
this secret compartment thing?

432
00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.963
Oh, yes, if those beastly Americans
haven't beaten us to it.

433
00:43:57.046 --> 00:43:58.590
- No offense.
- None taken.

434
00:43:58.673 --> 00:44:01.050
Hey, where'd our smelly
little friend get to?

435
00:44:16.316 --> 00:44:17.192
Hey.

436
00:44:22.238 --> 00:44:23.823
What have we here?

437
00:44:27.911 --> 00:44:29.162
Blue gold.

438
00:44:31.331 --> 00:44:34.209
This will fetch a mighty fine price.

439
00:44:46.137 --> 00:44:48.681
- Let's get us some treasure!
- Careful!

440
00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:51.517
Seti was no fool.

441
00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.021
I think perhaps
we should let the diggers open it. Hmm?

442
00:44:55.605 --> 00:44:59.400
Oh, I think we should listen
to the good doctor, Henderson.

443
00:44:59.943 --> 00:45:02.237
Yeah, sure. Let them open it.

444
00:45:25.842 --> 00:45:26.843
Let me get this straight.

445
00:45:26.927 --> 00:45:29.388
They ripped out your guts
and stuffed them in jars.

446
00:45:29.471 --> 00:45:31.098
And then they'd
take out your heart as well.

447
00:45:31.181 --> 00:45:33.141
Oh, and you know
how they took out your brains?

448
00:45:33.225 --> 00:45:34.851
Evy, I don't think we need to know this.

449
00:45:34.935 --> 00:45:38.188
They'd take a sharp, red-hot poker,
stick it up your nose,

450
00:45:38.272 --> 00:45:39.856
scramble things about a bit,

451
00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.566
and then rip it all out
through your nostrils.

452
00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:44.569
- Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
- It's called mummification.

453
00:45:44.653 --> 00:45:46.655
- You'll be dead when they do this.
- For the record,

454
00:45:46.738 --> 00:45:49.783
if I don't make it out of here,
don't put me down for mummification.

455
00:45:49.866 --> 00:45:50.701
Likewise.

456
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.379
Oh, my God. It's a...

457
00:46:02.921 --> 00:46:04.923
It's a sarcophagus.

458
00:46:07.759 --> 00:46:09.678
Buried at the base of Anubis.

459
00:46:11.805 --> 00:46:14.683
He must have been
someone of great importance.

460
00:46:16.101 --> 00:46:19.521
Or he did something very naughty.

461
00:46:22.232 --> 00:46:23.358
Oh, Allah.

462
00:46:27.779 --> 00:46:28.864
One more.

463
00:46:32.116 --> 00:46:33.784
One more.

464
00:46:50.426 --> 00:46:52.887
Help me! Help me!

465
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:54.263
Help me!

466
00:47:11.697 --> 00:47:13.074
Well, who is it?

467
00:47:15.409 --> 00:47:18.412
"He That Shall Not Be Named."

468
00:47:22.666 --> 00:47:24.418
This looks like some sort of a lock.

469
00:47:24.502 --> 00:47:26.712
Well, whoever's in here
sure wasn't getting out.

470
00:47:26.796 --> 00:47:27.838
Yeah, no kidding.

471
00:47:28.464 --> 00:47:30.966
It'd take us a month
to crack into this thing without a key.

472
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.968
A key?

473
00:47:33.469 --> 00:47:36.514
A key! A key!
Now that's what he was talking about!

474
00:47:36.597 --> 00:47:39.308
- Who was talking about what?
- The man... The man on the barge,

475
00:47:39.392 --> 00:47:41.310
the one with the hook.
He was looking for a key.

476
00:47:41.394 --> 00:47:42.728
Hey, that's mine.

477
00:48:08.294 --> 00:48:11.214
- What do you suppose killed him?
- Did you ever see him eat?

478
00:48:11.297 --> 00:48:12.632
Seems that our American friends

479
00:48:12.715 --> 00:48:15.135
had a little misfortune
of their own today.

480
00:48:15.218 --> 00:48:19.264
Three of their diggers were, uh, melted.

481
00:48:19.347 --> 00:48:21.099
- What?
- How?

482
00:48:21.182 --> 00:48:23.017
Salt acid.

483
00:48:23.101 --> 00:48:27.856
Pressurized salt acid.
Some kind of ancient booby trap.

484
00:48:28.565 --> 00:48:30.733
Maybe this place really is cursed.

485
00:48:34.446 --> 00:48:36.531
Oh, for goodness' sake, you two!

486
00:48:37.323 --> 00:48:39.159
- You don't believe in curses, huh?
- No, I don't.

487
00:48:39.242 --> 00:48:42.078
I believe if I can see it
and I can touch it, then it's real.

488
00:48:42.162 --> 00:48:43.329
That's what I believe.

489
00:48:43.413 --> 00:48:45.748
I believe in being prepared.

490
00:48:45.832 --> 00:48:48.334
Let's see what our friend
the warden believed in.

491
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.801
- What?
- My God, what is it?

492
00:48:57.927 --> 00:48:59.429
Hmm, a broken bottle.

493
00:48:59.596 --> 00:49:02.807
Glenlivet, 12 years old!

494
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:04.976
Well, he may have been a stinky fellow,

495
00:49:05.059 --> 00:49:06.478
but he had good taste.

496
00:49:09.981 --> 00:49:12.484
Take this. Stay here.

497
00:49:12.567 --> 00:49:15.612
- No, wait, wait! Wait for me. Wait!
- Evy!

498
00:49:15.695 --> 00:49:18.531
Excuse me,
but didn't the man just say stay here?

499
00:49:18.615 --> 00:49:19.657
Evy!

500
00:49:22.868 --> 00:49:25.746
Mr. Henderson! Wake up!

501
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.913
O'Connell!

502
00:50:26.431 --> 00:50:27.349
Enough!

503
00:50:29.017 --> 00:50:32.312
We will shed no more blood,
but you must leave.

504
00:50:32.938 --> 00:50:34.690
Leave this place or die.

505
00:50:36.108 --> 00:50:37.317
You have one day.

506
00:51:01.507 --> 00:51:02.508
Evelyn.

507
00:51:05.011 --> 00:51:06.012
Hey.

508
00:51:07.972 --> 00:51:11.058
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

509
00:51:11.559 --> 00:51:13.185
- You sure?
- Thank you.

510
00:51:13.269 --> 00:51:14.770
See, that proves it.

511
00:51:14.854 --> 00:51:17.398
Old Seti's fortune's
got to be under this sand.

512
00:51:17.481 --> 00:51:20.818
For them to protect it like this,
you know there's treasure down there.

513
00:51:20.901 --> 00:51:22.570
No,
these men are desert people.

514
00:51:22.653 --> 00:51:24.780
They value water, not gold.

515
00:51:24.864 --> 00:51:29.327
You know, maybe just at night,
we could, uh, combine forces, hmm?

516
00:51:30.661 --> 00:51:33.414
Hey, tough stuff,
try a right hook.

517
00:51:33.497 --> 00:51:35.708
Ball up your fist and put it...
Put it up like that.

518
00:51:35.791 --> 00:51:38.127
- Mmm-hmm.
- And then mean it. Hit it right here.

519
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:40.379
- Mean it!
- Okay.

520
00:51:43.257 --> 00:51:45.384
Okay, it's time for another drink.

521
00:51:46.135 --> 00:51:48.679
Unlike my brother, sir,

522
00:51:49.305 --> 00:51:51.515
I know when to say no.

523
00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:53.851
Uh-huh.

524
00:51:53.934 --> 00:51:56.020
And unlike your brother, miss,

525
00:51:56.103 --> 00:51:58.022
you, I just don't get.

526
00:51:58.105 --> 00:51:58.939
Ah.

527
00:52:00.107 --> 00:52:02.360
I know. You're wondering

528
00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:08.157
what is a place like me doing
in a girl like this.

529
00:52:08.574 --> 00:52:12.828
- Yeah, something like that.
- Egypt is in my blood.

530
00:52:12.912 --> 00:52:19.167
You see, my father
was a very, very famous explorer.

531
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:23.630
And he loved Egypt so much,
he married my mother,

532
00:52:23.713 --> 00:52:28.343
who was an Egyptian
and quite an adventurer herself.

533
00:52:29.427 --> 00:52:33.181
I get your father
and I get your mother, and, uh...

534
00:52:35.016 --> 00:52:37.185
I get him, but...

535
00:52:38.061 --> 00:52:39.062
What are you doing here?

536
00:52:41.314 --> 00:52:45.902
Look, I... I may not be an explorer

537
00:52:45.985 --> 00:52:50.115
or an adventurer or a treasure seeker

538
00:52:50.198 --> 00:52:54.244
or a gunfighter, Mr. O'Connell,

539
00:52:54.327 --> 00:52:58.665
but I am proud of what I am.

540
00:52:59.749 --> 00:53:01.376
And what is that?

541
00:53:01.459 --> 00:53:02.752
I...

542
00:53:04.796 --> 00:53:06.923
...am a librarian.

543
00:53:10.802 --> 00:53:14.097
And I am going to kiss you,

544
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.016
- Mr. O'Connell.
- Call me Rick.

545
00:53:18.393 --> 00:53:19.227
Oh.

546
00:53:23.148 --> 00:53:24.649
Rick.

547
00:54:00.851 --> 00:54:03.562
- There is a curse upon this chest.
- Curse, my ass.

548
00:54:03.645 --> 00:54:06.064
- Yeah, who cares?
- Have a care, Mr. Henderson.

549
00:54:06.607 --> 00:54:09.526
In these hallowed grounds,
that which was set forth in ancient times

550
00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:12.362
- is as strong today as it was then.
- Yeah, yeah, we understand.

551
00:54:12.446 --> 00:54:13.906
What's it say?

552
00:54:21.455 --> 00:54:23.957
"Death will come on swift wings

553
00:54:24.041 --> 00:54:26.960
to whomsoever opens this chest."

554
00:54:38.263 --> 00:54:40.516
We should not be here.

555
00:54:41.058 --> 00:54:42.434
This is not good.

556
00:54:42.518 --> 00:54:43.977
It says,

557
00:54:44.061 --> 00:54:46.563
"There is one, the undead,

558
00:54:46.647 --> 00:54:50.108
who, if brought back to life,
is bound by sacred law

559
00:54:50.192 --> 00:54:51.860
to consummate this curse."

560
00:54:51.944 --> 00:54:53.111
Well, Let's make sure

561
00:54:53.195 --> 00:54:54.863
we don't bring anyone
back from the dead then, huh?

562
00:54:54.947 --> 00:54:58.450
"He will kill all who open this chest

563
00:54:58.534 --> 00:55:01.453
and assimilate their organs and fluids,

564
00:55:02.788 --> 00:55:05.541
and in so doing, he will regenerate

565
00:55:05.624 --> 00:55:08.417
and no longer be the undead,

566
00:55:08.501 --> 00:55:11.087
but a plague upon this Earth."

567
00:55:12.797 --> 00:55:15.967
Well, we didn't come
all this way for nothing.

568
00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:17.927
- That's right.
- It's the curse.

569
00:55:18.553 --> 00:55:20.179
It's the curse.

570
00:55:20.263 --> 00:55:24.183
It's the curse! Beware of the curse!

571
00:55:24.267 --> 00:55:25.643
Beware!

572
00:55:25.726 --> 00:55:28.563
Stupid superstitious bastard.

573
00:55:30.898 --> 00:55:33.609
Oh, I've dreamt about this
since I was a little girl.

574
00:55:33.693 --> 00:55:35.027
You dream about dead guys?

575
00:55:35.111 --> 00:55:38.239
Oh, look, the sacred spells
have been chiseled off.

576
00:55:38.322 --> 00:55:41.492
Now, this man must have been condemned
not only in this life, but in the next.

577
00:55:41.576 --> 00:55:43.953
- Tough break.
- Yeah, I'm all tears.

578
00:55:44.036 --> 00:55:47.665
Now, let's see who's inside, shall we?

579
00:55:58.718 --> 00:56:00.845
Oh, my God,
I hate it when these things do that.

580
00:56:00.928 --> 00:56:02.471
Is he supposed to look like that?

581
00:56:02.555 --> 00:56:04.891
No, I've never seen
a mummy look like this before.

582
00:56:04.974 --> 00:56:07.935
He's still... Still...

583
00:56:08.019 --> 00:56:10.104
- Juicy.
- Yes.

584
00:56:10.187 --> 00:56:13.107
He must be more than 3,000 years old,

585
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:16.110
and, well, it looks as if he's still

586
00:56:16.193 --> 00:56:18.321
decomposing.

587
00:56:18.404 --> 00:56:20.114
Hey, look at that.

588
00:56:22.617 --> 00:56:26.162
- What do you make of this?
- My God, these marks were made with...

589
00:56:27.788 --> 00:56:29.373
Fingernails.

590
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:32.627
This man was buried alive.

591
00:56:34.628 --> 00:56:36.338
And he left a message.

592
00:56:37.505 --> 00:56:40.926
"Death is only the beginning."

593
00:56:59.945 --> 00:57:01.780
Oh, my God.

594
00:57:02.238 --> 00:57:03.782
It does exist.

595
00:57:04.824 --> 00:57:07.494
- The <i>Book of the Dead.</i>
- A book?

596
00:57:07.577 --> 00:57:10.372
Who cares about a book?
Where the hell's the treasure?

597
00:57:10.455 --> 00:57:12.540
This, gentlemen.

598
00:57:13.249 --> 00:57:15.669
This is treasure.

599
00:57:16.753 --> 00:57:18.296
Hell, I wouldn't trade you for a brass...

600
00:57:22.259 --> 00:57:24.052
Look at that.

601
00:57:25.428 --> 00:57:27.681
There's your treasure, gentlemen.

602
00:57:27.764 --> 00:57:29.599
Well, now we're on to something.

603
00:57:45.865 --> 00:57:48.201
I believe you need a key
to open that book.

604
00:57:50.704 --> 00:57:52.122
Say, O'Connell,

605
00:57:52.205 --> 00:57:54.291
what do you think
these babies'll fetch back home?

606
00:57:54.374 --> 00:57:55.875
We hear you boys found yourselves

607
00:57:55.959 --> 00:57:58.670
a nice, gooey mummy.
Well, Congratulations.

608
00:57:58.753 --> 00:57:59.963
You know, if you dry that fellow out,

609
00:58:00.046 --> 00:58:01.755
you might be able
to sell him for firewood.

610
00:58:03.424 --> 00:58:04.717
Look what I found.

611
00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.343
You're in her seat.

612
00:58:06.427 --> 00:58:07.803
- Now!
- Yup.

613
00:58:07.886 --> 00:58:11.098
Scarab skeletons, flesh-eaters.

614
00:58:11.181 --> 00:58:13.517
I found them inside our friend's coffin.

615
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:17.563
They can stay alive for years
feasting on the flesh of a corpse.

616
00:58:18.022 --> 00:58:21.734
Unfortunately for our friend, he was
still alive when they started eating him.

617
00:58:22.359 --> 00:58:24.445
So somebody
threw these in with our guy,

618
00:58:24.528 --> 00:58:26.530
and then they slowly ate him alive?

619
00:58:26.613 --> 00:58:28.073
Very slowly.

620
00:58:28.157 --> 00:58:30.993
Well, he certainly wasn't a popular fellow
when they planted him, was he?

621
00:58:31.076 --> 00:58:34.371
You know, probably got a little too frisky
with the pharaoh's daughter.

622
00:58:35.456 --> 00:58:37.708
Well, according to my readings,

623
00:58:37.791 --> 00:58:42.254
our friend suffered the Hom-Dai,
the worst of all Ancient Egyptian curses,

624
00:58:42.338 --> 00:58:44.757
one reserved only
for the most evil of blasphemers.

625
00:58:45.341 --> 00:58:48.510
In my research, I've never heard of
this curse having actually been performed.

626
00:58:48.594 --> 00:58:51.138
- That bad, huh?
- Yes, well, they...

627
00:58:51.221 --> 00:58:53.474
They never used it,
because they feared it so.

628
00:58:54.099 --> 00:58:58.604
It's written that if a victim
of the Hom-Dai should ever arise,

629
00:58:58.687 --> 00:59:01.982
he would bring with him
the ten plagues of Egypt.

630
00:59:32.887 --> 00:59:34.931
That's called stealing, you know.

631
00:59:35.014 --> 00:59:38.726
According to you and my brother,
it's called borrowing.

632
00:59:41.687 --> 00:59:44.357
I thought the <i>Book of Amun-Ra</i>
was made out of gold.

633
00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:48.236
It is made out of gold.
This isn't the <i>Book of Amun-Ra.</i>

634
00:59:48.319 --> 00:59:50.613
This is something else.

635
00:59:50.696 --> 00:59:53.491
I think this may be the <i>Book of the Dead.</i>

636
00:59:54.117 --> 00:59:55.618
The <i>Book of the Dead?</i>

637
00:59:55.952 --> 00:59:57.995
Are you sure you want to be
playing around with this thing?

638
00:59:58.079 --> 01:00:00.123
It's just a book.

639
01:00:00.206 --> 01:00:03.876
No harm ever came from reading a book.

640
01:00:09.674 --> 01:00:11.259
That happens a lot around here.

641
01:00:14.637 --> 01:00:15.847
So, what's it say?

642
01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:19.267
"Amun Ra. Amun Dei."

643
01:00:19.892 --> 01:00:22.145
It speaks of the night and of the day.

644
01:00:35.741 --> 01:00:38.035
No!

645
01:00:38.619 --> 01:00:40.204
You must not read from the book!

646
01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:46.043
Huh?

647
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.231
Run!

648
01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:12.360
Go, go!

649
01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:23.121
What have we done?

650
01:01:24.498 --> 01:01:25.874
Where the hell did they come from?

651
01:01:25.957 --> 01:01:27.959
I ain't waiting around to find out.

652
01:01:31.463 --> 01:01:34.049
My glasses. My glasses!

653
01:01:34.132 --> 01:01:35.926
Leave me! Leave me!

654
01:01:36.009 --> 01:01:37.761
Hey! Hey!

655
01:01:38.678 --> 01:01:39.763
Could you help me find my...

656
01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.057
Oh.

657
01:01:44.392 --> 01:01:46.102
Wait for me!

658
01:02:07.999 --> 01:02:10.710
Who's there?

659
01:02:13.505 --> 01:02:14.839
Who's there?

660
01:02:29.103 --> 01:02:30.229
Daniels?

661
01:02:53.752 --> 01:02:55.504
Oh, Jon!

662
01:03:02.386 --> 01:03:03.637
Scarabs!

663
01:03:04.096 --> 01:03:07.099
Run, Evy! Go, go, go! Run!

664
01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:40.466
- Evelyn?
- Evy?

665
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:42.760
- Evelyn?
- Evy!

666
01:03:56.689 --> 01:03:58.608
Oh, Mr. Burns. Thank goodness.

667
01:03:58.691 --> 01:04:01.235
I was just starting to get scared.

668
01:04:01.319 --> 01:04:03.946
I've lost everyone.

669
01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:06.366
My eyes. My eyes!

670
01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:16.834
Oh...

671
01:04:27.679 --> 01:04:29.889
Please help me.

672
01:04:30.765 --> 01:04:34.686
My tongue. He took my tongue.

673
01:04:34.769 --> 01:04:36.062
Please don't leave me.

674
01:04:39.565 --> 01:04:41.317
Anck-Su-Namun?

675
01:04:41.401 --> 01:04:43.528
Damn it! It's a trap door.

676
01:04:43.611 --> 01:04:45.947
There's gotta be a switch
or something around here someplace.

677
01:04:47.657 --> 01:04:50.660
- Run, you sons of bitches! Run!
- Go.

678
01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:05.633
Go! Go!

679
01:05:12.724 --> 01:05:15.809
Come with me, my Princess Anck-Su-Namun.

680
01:05:17.394 --> 01:05:19.271
There you are!
Will you quit playing hide- and-seek?

681
01:05:19.354 --> 01:05:21.356
Come on. Let's get out of here.

682
01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.858
Whoa!

683
01:05:22.941 --> 01:05:24.317
Evy!

684
01:05:36.496 --> 01:05:38.206
- Move!
- Yeah, right.

685
01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:41.376
Did you see that?
It was walking. It was walking!

686
01:05:51.052 --> 01:05:52.721
I told you to leave or die.

687
01:05:53.764 --> 01:05:54.973
You refused.

688
01:05:55.474 --> 01:05:57.350
Now you may have killed us all,

689
01:05:57.434 --> 01:05:58.685
for you have unleashed a creature

690
01:05:58.769 --> 01:06:00.562
that we have feared
for more than 3,000 years.

691
01:06:00.645 --> 01:06:04.274
- Relax. I got him.
- No mortal weapon can kill this creature.

692
01:06:04.357 --> 01:06:06.026
He's not of this world.

693
01:06:14.618 --> 01:06:16.995
- You bastard.
- What did you do to him?

694
01:06:17.078 --> 01:06:20.165
We saved him. Saved him
before the creature could finish his work.

695
01:06:21.416 --> 01:06:23.877
Leave, all of you, quickly,
before he finishes you all.

696
01:06:28.173 --> 01:06:31.468
I must now go on the hunt,
and try and find a way to kill him.

697
01:06:31.551 --> 01:06:33.553
I already told you, I got him.

698
01:06:36.431 --> 01:06:37.641
Know this,

699
01:06:38.433 --> 01:06:41.018
this creature is the bringer of death.

700
01:06:41.101 --> 01:06:44.021
He will never eat, he will never sleep,

701
01:06:44.104 --> 01:06:45.940
and he will never stop.

702
01:07:19.306 --> 01:07:22.059
May the good Lord
protect and watch over me

703
01:07:22.142 --> 01:07:24.687
as a shepherd watches over his flock.

704
01:07:38.784 --> 01:07:41.078
No? Okay.

705
01:07:59.889 --> 01:08:01.557
The language of the slaves...

706
01:08:03.851 --> 01:08:06.686
I may have use for you.

707
01:08:08.396 --> 01:08:09.314
And the rewards...

708
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:13.234
...will be great.

709
01:08:15.612 --> 01:08:17.363
My prince.

710
01:08:20.158 --> 01:08:23.745
Where are the other sacred jars?

711
01:08:42.931 --> 01:08:44.807
FORT BRYDON - CAIRO

712
01:08:51.481 --> 01:08:54.776
I thought you said you didn't believe
in that fairy tales and hokum stuff. Shoo!

713
01:08:54.859 --> 01:08:56.152
Having an encounter

714
01:08:56.235 --> 01:08:59.113
with a 3,000-year-old
walking, talking corpse

715
01:08:59.197 --> 01:09:00.698
does tend to convert one.

716
01:09:00.782 --> 01:09:03.952
Well, forget it. We're out the door,
we're down the hall and we're gone.

717
01:09:04.035 --> 01:09:07.288
- Oh, no, we are not.
- Oh, yes, we are.

718
01:09:07.372 --> 01:09:08.373
Oh, no, we are not.

719
01:09:08.456 --> 01:09:09.958
We woke him up
and we are going to stop him.

720
01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:12.168
We? What we? We didn't read that book.

721
01:09:12.251 --> 01:09:13.628
I told you not to
play around with that thing.

722
01:09:13.711 --> 01:09:15.296
Didn't I tell you
not to play around with that thing?

723
01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.506
Right then, me, me, me, me.

724
01:09:16.589 --> 01:09:18.424
I, I, I woke him up
and I intend to stop him.

725
01:09:18.508 --> 01:09:19.759
Oh, yeah? How?

726
01:09:19.842 --> 01:09:22.261
You heard the man.
No mortal weapons can kill this guy.

727
01:09:22.345 --> 01:09:25.640
Oh, well, then we are just
going to have to find some immortal ones.

728
01:09:25.723 --> 01:09:27.392
There goes that "we" again.

729
01:09:27.475 --> 01:09:29.560
Look, will you just listen to me?
We have to do something.

730
01:09:29.644 --> 01:09:31.437
Once this creature has been reborn,

731
01:09:31.521 --> 01:09:33.939
his curse is going to spread
until the whole of the Earth is destroyed.

732
01:09:34.022 --> 01:09:37.150
- Yeah? And is that my problem?
- Well, it is everybody's problem.

733
01:09:37.234 --> 01:09:39.444
Evelyn, I appreciate
you saving my life and all,

734
01:09:39.528 --> 01:09:41.029
but when I signed on, I agreed

735
01:09:41.113 --> 01:09:42.990
to take you out there
and to bring you back.

736
01:09:43.073 --> 01:09:46.201
I have done that. End of job.
End of story. Contract terminated.

737
01:09:46.284 --> 01:09:47.619
That's all I am to you? A contract?

738
01:09:47.703 --> 01:09:49.705
Look, you can either tag along with me

739
01:09:49.788 --> 01:09:52.916
or you can stay here
and try and save the world.

740
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.293
- What's it gonna be?
- I'm staying.

741
01:09:55.377 --> 01:09:56.461
- Fine.
- Fine.

742
01:09:57.004 --> 01:09:58.630
- Fine.
- Fine.

743
01:09:58.714 --> 01:09:59.840
Fine.

744
01:10:06.304 --> 01:10:09.891
I'm the last of the Royal Air Corps
still stationed out here, you know...

745
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.061
Some bloody idiot spilt his drink.

746
01:10:13.562 --> 01:10:17.399
All the other laddies died in the sky
and were buried in the sand.

747
01:10:17.482 --> 01:10:19.234
Good chaps, every one of them, too.

748
01:10:20.277 --> 01:10:22.320
- Oh, hey, Winston.
- Yeah...

749
01:10:22.404 --> 01:10:26.742
Oh, you know, O'Connell,
ever since the end of the Great War,

750
01:10:26.825 --> 01:10:32.039
there hasn't been a single challenge
worthy of a man like me.

751
01:10:32.122 --> 01:10:33.707
Yeah? We all got
our little problems today,

752
01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:34.791
don't we, Winston?

753
01:10:34.875 --> 01:10:37.961
I just wish I could have chucked it in
with the others

754
01:10:38.045 --> 01:10:40.297
and gone down in flame and glory,

755
01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.466
instead of sitting around here, rotting

756
01:10:42.549 --> 01:10:44.301
- of boredom and booze.
- Of boredom and booze.

757
01:10:44.384 --> 01:10:45.886
Cheers, hmm.

758
01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:51.558
Oh, well, back to the airfield, ha-ha!

759
01:10:52.726 --> 01:10:54.644
Tell me, has your sister always been...

760
01:10:54.728 --> 01:10:56.438
- Oh, yes, always.
- Well, we're all packed up,

761
01:10:56.521 --> 01:10:58.522
but the damn boat
doesn't leave till tomorrow morning.

762
01:10:58.606 --> 01:11:00.941
Tail set firmly between your legs, I see.

763
01:11:01.025 --> 01:11:04.904
Yeah, you can talk. You don't have
some sacred walking corpse after you.

764
01:11:04.987 --> 01:11:07.615
So, uh, how's your friend?

765
01:11:09.408 --> 01:11:11.327
He had his eyes and his tongue ripped out.

766
01:11:11.994 --> 01:11:13.496
How would you be?

767
01:11:14.121 --> 01:11:18.084
I'm so pleased to meet you.

768
01:11:18.876 --> 01:11:22.171
Prince Imhotep
does not like to be touched.

769
01:11:22.254 --> 01:11:25.382
A silly Eastern superstition, I'm afraid.

770
01:11:25.883 --> 01:11:28.719
Please forgive me.

771
01:11:28.803 --> 01:11:30.596
Oh, whoops.

772
01:11:32.014 --> 01:11:36.811
Mr. Burns, Prince Imhotep
thanks you for your hospitality.

773
01:11:36.894 --> 01:11:38.437
No.

774
01:11:39.063 --> 01:11:41.065
And for your eyes,

775
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:44.735
- and for your tongue.
- What...

776
01:11:44.819 --> 01:11:47.780
- But I am afraid more is needed.
- What...

777
01:11:48.489 --> 01:11:49.990
The prince must finish the job

778
01:11:50.783 --> 01:11:52.409
and consummate the curse,

779
01:11:52.493 --> 01:11:54.203
- which you and your friends...
- No!

780
01:11:54.286 --> 01:11:57.498
- ...have brought down upon yourselves.
- No! Wait! No!

781
01:12:02.044 --> 01:12:03.420
Good luck, boys.

782
01:12:08.384 --> 01:12:10.010
Sweet Jesus!

783
01:12:10.469 --> 01:12:12.138
Tasted just like...

784
01:12:13.389 --> 01:12:14.682
Blood.

785
01:12:14.765 --> 01:12:17.810
"And the rivers
and waters of Egypt ran red

786
01:12:18.519 --> 01:12:20.604
and were as blood."

787
01:12:22.606 --> 01:12:23.983
He's here.

788
01:12:28.361 --> 01:12:30.530
Oh, looks like it's gonna storm.

789
01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:33.158
- Oh, Evelyn!
- Oh, so you're still here.

790
01:12:34.492 --> 01:12:35.660
We've got problems.

791
01:12:58.683 --> 01:12:59.684
Hey!

792
01:13:00.852 --> 01:13:02.979
Beni, you little stinkweed.
Where've you been?

793
01:13:28.796 --> 01:13:30.715
We are in serious trouble.

794
01:13:47.982 --> 01:13:50.109
You saved me from the undead.

795
01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:51.693
I thank you.

796
01:14:08.543 --> 01:14:11.421
We are in very serious trouble.

797
01:14:13.423 --> 01:14:15.717
He does seem to like you Evy.
Yeah, what's that about?

798
01:14:15.801 --> 01:14:17.094
What's this guy want anyway?

799
01:14:17.177 --> 01:14:20.180
There's only one person I know
that can possibly give us any answers.

800
01:14:20.264 --> 01:14:22.557
You!
Miss Carnahan.

801
01:14:23.475 --> 01:14:25.352
- Gentlemen.
- What is he doing here?

802
01:14:26.353 --> 01:14:29.940
Do you really want to know,
or would you prefer to just shoot us?

803
01:14:30.023 --> 01:14:34.152
After what I just saw,
I'm willing to go on a little faith here.

804
01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:36.822
We are part
of an ancient secret society.

805
01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:40.033
For over 3,000 years,
we have guarded the City of the Dead.

806
01:14:40.826 --> 01:14:43.495
We are sworn at manhood
to do any and all in our part

807
01:14:43.578 --> 01:14:46.581
to stop the High Priest Imhotep
from being reborn into this world.

808
01:14:46.665 --> 01:14:48.125
And now, because of you, we have failed.

809
01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:50.752
And you think this justifies
the killing of innocent people?

810
01:14:50.836 --> 01:14:52.879
To stop this creature? Let me think.

811
01:14:52.963 --> 01:14:54.172
Yes!

812
01:14:55.924 --> 01:14:58.593
Question. Why doesn't he like cats?

813
01:14:58.677 --> 01:15:00.679
Well, cats are the guardians
of the underworld.

814
01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:02.597
He will fear them
until he is fully regenerated.

815
01:15:02.681 --> 01:15:04.182
And then he will fear nothing.

816
01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:06.059
Yeah, and you know
how he gets his self fully regenerated?

817
01:15:06.143 --> 01:15:08.353
By killing everyone who opened that chest.

818
01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:10.230
And sucking them dry, that's how!

819
01:15:10.314 --> 01:15:12.024
Jonathan, will you stop
playing with that?

820
01:15:12.649 --> 01:15:17.529
When I saw him alive at Hamunaptra,
he called me Anck-Su-Namun.

821
01:15:19.363 --> 01:15:22.408
And then just now in Mr. Burns' quarters,
he tried to kiss me.

822
01:15:22.491 --> 01:15:25.369
It's because of his love for Anck-Su-Namun
that he was cursed.

823
01:15:25.453 --> 01:15:28.331
- Apparently, even after 3,000 years...
- He is still in love with her.

824
01:15:28.414 --> 01:15:31.459
Yes well, that's very romantic,
but what has it got to do with me?

825
01:15:31.542 --> 01:15:33.544
Perhaps he will once again
try to raise her from the dead.

826
01:15:33.627 --> 01:15:34.670
Yes.

827
01:15:34.754 --> 01:15:37.590
And it appears he's already
chosen his human sacrifice.

828
01:15:40.676 --> 01:15:42.553
Bad luck, old mum.

829
01:15:42.636 --> 01:15:44.138
On the contrary,

830
01:15:44.221 --> 01:15:47.308
it may just give us the time we need
to kill the creature.

831
01:15:48.267 --> 01:15:50.353
We will need all the help we can get.

832
01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.688
His powers are growing.

833
01:15:58.361 --> 01:15:59.737
"And he stretched forth his hand

834
01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:01.238
towards the heavens

835
01:16:01.989 --> 01:16:04.992
and there was darkness
throughout the land of Egypt."

836
01:16:06.577 --> 01:16:08.287
We must stop him
from regenerating.

837
01:16:08.371 --> 01:16:09.455
Who opened that chest?

838
01:16:09.538 --> 01:16:10.998
Well,
there was me and Daniels here.

839
01:16:11.082 --> 01:16:13.501
- Oh, and Burns, of course.
- And that Egyptologist fellow.

840
01:16:13.584 --> 01:16:14.585
What about my buddy, Beni?

841
01:16:14.668 --> 01:16:17.004
No, he scrammed out of there
before we opened the damn thing.

842
01:16:17.088 --> 01:16:20.132
- Yeah, he was the smart one.
- Yeah, that sounds like Beni.

843
01:16:20.216 --> 01:16:22.009
We must find the Egyptologist

844
01:16:22.093 --> 01:16:23.552
and bring him back
to the safety of the fort

845
01:16:23.636 --> 01:16:25.930
- before the creature can get to him.
- Right.

846
01:16:26.013 --> 01:16:27.515
She stays here. You three, come with me.

847
01:16:27.598 --> 01:16:29.183
Not me...
No, no!

848
01:16:29.266 --> 01:16:30.976
Just a minute! You can't
just leave me behind here

849
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.145
like some old kind of carpetbag.

850
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:34.730
I mean, who put you in charge...

851
01:16:34.814 --> 01:16:36.816
O'Connell!
What do you think you are doing?

852
01:16:36.899 --> 01:16:38.567
Jonathan! O'Connell!

853
01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:41.362
- Sorry, but he's a bit tall.
- Jonathan, coward that you are!

854
01:16:41.445 --> 01:16:43.906
O'Connell, you are not leaving me in here!

855
01:16:44.697 --> 01:16:47.325
Jonathan, if you don't
open this door in one minute flat...

856
01:16:47.409 --> 01:16:49.577
- O'Connell...
- This door doesn't open.

857
01:16:49.661 --> 01:16:51.037
- ...let me out of here.
- She doesn't come out,

858
01:16:51.121 --> 01:16:52.997
- and no one goes in, right?
- Right.

859
01:16:53.081 --> 01:16:54.666
- Right?
- Right.

860
01:16:54.749 --> 01:16:57.335
O'Connell! Jonathan!

861
01:16:57.419 --> 01:16:58.253
Let's go, Jonathan.

862
01:16:58.336 --> 01:17:00.505
Oh, uh, I thought
I could just stay at the fort

863
01:17:00.588 --> 01:17:01.506
and, uh, reconnoiter...

864
01:17:01.589 --> 01:17:03.049
- Now!
- Yeah, right.

865
01:17:03.133 --> 01:17:05.176
We're just gonna rescue the Egyptologist.

866
01:17:38.334 --> 01:17:41.754
Well, well, well.
Let me guess. Spring cleaning.

867
01:17:46.176 --> 01:17:47.010
Nice shot.

868
01:17:48.887 --> 01:17:51.347
Oh, Beni, did you fall down?
Here, let me help you up.

869
01:17:53.850 --> 01:17:57.479
You came back from the desert
with a new friend, didn't you, Beni?

870
01:17:57.562 --> 01:17:59.731
What friend? You are my only friend.

871
01:18:02.650 --> 01:18:04.903
What the hell are you doing
with this creep, huh, Beni?

872
01:18:04.986 --> 01:18:06.279
What's in it for you?

873
01:18:06.362 --> 01:18:08.865
It is better to be
the right hand of the devil

874
01:18:08.948 --> 01:18:10.325
than in his path.

875
01:18:10.407 --> 01:18:13.827
As long as I serve him, I am immune.

876
01:18:17.414 --> 01:18:18.790
Immune from what?

877
01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:21.418
What did you say?

878
01:18:21.502 --> 01:18:23.837
I don't wanna tell you.
You'll just hurt me some more.

879
01:18:24.463 --> 01:18:26.882
What are you looking for?
And try not to lie to me.

880
01:18:26.965 --> 01:18:28.717
The book!

881
01:18:29.092 --> 01:18:31.094
The black book they found at Hamunaptra.

882
01:18:31.178 --> 01:18:32.346
He wants it back.

883
01:18:32.429 --> 01:18:34.515
He said to me it would be
worth its weight in gold.

884
01:18:34.598 --> 01:18:36.975
- What does he want the book for?
- Oh, come on, I don't know.

885
01:18:37.976 --> 01:18:40.687
Something about bringing
his dead girlfriend back to life.

886
01:18:40.771 --> 01:18:43.607
But that's all.
He just wants the book, I swear.

887
01:18:43.690 --> 01:18:45.817
Just the book, I swear.

888
01:18:45.901 --> 01:18:46.777
And your sister.

889
01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.111
But other than that...

890
01:19:39.537 --> 01:19:42.623
- That's two down, two to go.
- Then he'll be coming after Evy.

891
01:19:43.332 --> 01:19:44.834
Guards in place!

892
01:19:44.917 --> 01:19:46.836
Reporting all clear, sir!

893
01:19:46.919 --> 01:19:48.337
To hell with this.

894
01:19:48.421 --> 01:19:50.715
I'm going downstairs, get me a drink.
You want something?

895
01:19:50.798 --> 01:19:53.467
- Yeah. Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon.
- All right.

896
01:19:54.218 --> 01:19:56.387
- And a shot of bourbon.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

897
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:59.015
- And a bourbon chaser.
- Yeah, yeah, I'll get your damn bourbon!

898
01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:00.683
Don't worry about the door.

899
01:21:40.865 --> 01:21:42.784
Anck-Su-Namun.

900
01:21:53.712 --> 01:21:56.297
Hey, get your ugly face off of her!

901
01:22:00.135 --> 01:22:01.136
Look what I got.

902
01:22:18.695 --> 01:22:22.073
- You all right?
- Well, I'm not sure.

903
01:22:32.291 --> 01:22:33.500
Yes, well, according to legend,

904
01:22:33.584 --> 01:22:36.336
the black book
that the Americans found at Hamunaptra

905
01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.380
is supposed to bring people
back from the dead.

906
01:22:38.464 --> 01:22:40.591
Until now, it was a notion
I was unwilling to believe.

907
01:22:40.674 --> 01:22:41.508
Believe it, sister.

908
01:22:41.592 --> 01:22:43.302
That's what
brought our buddy back to life.

909
01:22:43.385 --> 01:22:45.220
Yes. And I'm thinking
that if the black book

910
01:22:45.304 --> 01:22:46.680
can bring dead people to life...

911
01:22:46.764 --> 01:22:50.476
- Then maybe the gold book can kill him.
- That's the myth.

912
01:22:50.559 --> 01:22:52.895
Now, we just have to find out
where the gold book is hidden.

913
01:22:53.437 --> 01:22:59.193
Imhotep. Imhotep. Imhotep.

914
01:22:59.276 --> 01:23:05.407
Imhotep. Imhotep. Imhotep.

915
01:23:17.711 --> 01:23:21.715
Last but not least,
my favorite plague, boils and sores.

916
01:23:22.174 --> 01:23:24.259
They have become his slaves.

917
01:23:24.343 --> 01:23:27.554
So it has begun, the beginning of the end.

918
01:23:27.638 --> 01:23:30.307
Not quite yet, it hasn't. Come on.

919
01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.874
According to Bembridge scholars,
the golden <i>Book of Amun-Ra</i>

920
01:23:55.958 --> 01:23:58.000
is located inside the statue of Anubis.

921
01:23:58.084 --> 01:24:00.127
- That's where we found the black book.
- Exactly.

922
01:24:00.211 --> 01:24:01.921
Well, looks like the old boys
at Bembridge were mistaken.

923
01:24:02.004 --> 01:24:03.881
Yes, they mixed the books up.

924
01:24:03.965 --> 01:24:06.092
Mixed up where they were buried.

925
01:24:06.175 --> 01:24:08.803
So, if the black book
is inside the statue of Anubis,

926
01:24:08.886 --> 01:24:11.514
then the golden book must be inside...

927
01:24:16.936 --> 01:24:20.022
- Come on, Evy, faster.
- Patience is a virtue.

928
01:24:22.233 --> 01:24:23.526
Not right now, it isn't.

929
01:24:23.609 --> 01:24:26.821
- I think I'll go and get the car started.
- I've got it.

930
01:24:26.904 --> 01:24:28.322
The golden <i>Book of Amun-Ra</i>

931
01:24:28.406 --> 01:24:31.242
is at Hamunaptra,
inside the statue of Horus.

932
01:24:31.325 --> 01:24:33.202
Take that, Bembridge scholars.

933
01:24:42.837 --> 01:24:45.464
Imhotep.

934
01:24:45.548 --> 01:24:52.513
Imhotep. Imhotep. Imhotep.

935
01:25:02.815 --> 01:25:04.650
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

936
01:25:06.736 --> 01:25:09.530
Get this thing in gear, boy.
Let's get out of here.

937
01:25:09.614 --> 01:25:11.115
- Evy. Come on, Evy. Hurry up.
- Imhotep!

938
01:25:11.198 --> 01:25:13.242
Imhotep!

939
01:25:19.916 --> 01:25:22.542
You're gonna get yours, Beni! You hear me?

940
01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:27.464
- You're gonna get yours!
- Oh, like I've never heard that before!

941
01:25:58.036 --> 01:25:59.537
Hang on!

942
01:26:35.865 --> 01:26:38.076
Hey! O'Connell! O'Connell!

943
01:27:33.839 --> 01:27:34.840
Jump down!

944
01:27:38.177 --> 01:27:39.094
Move, move, move!

945
01:27:42.931 --> 01:27:48.062
Imhotep.
Imhotep. Imhotep.

946
01:27:58.906 --> 01:28:00.449
It's the creature.

947
01:28:01.533 --> 01:28:03.452
He's fully regenerated.

948
01:28:08.582 --> 01:28:10.292
"Come with me, my princess.

949
01:28:11.126 --> 01:28:14.213
It is time to make you mine forever."

950
01:28:14.296 --> 01:28:16.089
For all eternity, idiot.

951
01:28:22.595 --> 01:28:25.848
"Take my hand,
and I will spare your friends."

952
01:28:26.432 --> 01:28:28.267
Oh, dear.

953
01:28:30.812 --> 01:28:33.648
- Have you got any bright ideas?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

954
01:28:33.731 --> 01:28:37.026
You better think of something fast,
because if he turns me into a mummy,

955
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:38.778
you're the first one I'm coming after.

956
01:28:43.574 --> 01:28:44.867
- No.
- Don't.

957
01:28:44.951 --> 01:28:46.035
No!

958
01:28:46.119 --> 01:28:48.079
He still has to take me
to Hamunaptra to perform the ritual.

959
01:28:48.162 --> 01:28:51.624
She is right. Live today, fight tomorrow.

960
01:29:03.344 --> 01:29:06.139
I'll be seeing you again.

961
01:29:12.019 --> 01:29:13.312
Evelyn!

962
01:29:16.190 --> 01:29:19.026
- Hey, that's mine.
- Thank you.

963
01:29:20.653 --> 01:29:21.946
Kill them all!

964
01:29:22.029 --> 01:29:23.906
No! Let go of me!

965
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:25.867
Imhotep.
Let go of me!

966
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:27.535
Goodbye, my friend.

967
01:29:27.618 --> 01:29:28.953
Come here, you little...

968
01:29:30.538 --> 01:29:34.041
Imhotep. Imhotep. Imhotep.

969
01:29:38.045 --> 01:29:39.130
Come on!

970
01:29:39.213 --> 01:29:40.965
- What about my sister?
- We're gonna get her back!

971
01:29:41.048 --> 01:29:42.007
Go!

972
01:29:43.091 --> 01:29:43.967
You're next!

973
01:29:46.094 --> 01:29:47.470
Come on! Give me your hand!

974
01:29:47.846 --> 01:29:49.931
- You go!
- Come on!

975
01:29:50.015 --> 01:29:51.850
Go!

976
01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:27.052
Morning, Winston. Uh, a word?

977
01:30:28.678 --> 01:30:32.182
So what's your little problem got to do
with His Majesty's Royal Air Corps?

978
01:30:32.265 --> 01:30:33.516
Not a damn thing.

979
01:30:35.977 --> 01:30:37.062
Is it dangerous?

980
01:30:37.145 --> 01:30:38.730
You probably won't live through it.

981
01:30:38.813 --> 01:30:40.315
By Jove, do you really think so?

982
01:30:40.398 --> 01:30:43.360
Well, everybody else
we've bumped into has died. Why not you?

983
01:30:43.443 --> 01:30:45.612
What's the, uh...
What's the challenge, then?

984
01:30:45.695 --> 01:30:49.115
Rescue the damsel in distress,
kill the bad guy, and save the world.

985
01:30:50.951 --> 01:30:54.037
Winston Havelock
at your service, sir. Ha-ha!

986
01:31:04.839 --> 01:31:06.341
Are you all right?

987
01:31:07.509 --> 01:31:09.802
Do I bloody look all right?

988
01:31:14.014 --> 01:31:15.265
How you doing?

989
01:31:25.734 --> 01:31:28.946
See that? I've never seen one so big.

990
01:31:29.488 --> 01:31:31.657
- Never?
- No!

991
01:31:44.253 --> 01:31:47.339
Get off me! Get off!

992
01:31:49.174 --> 01:31:50.926
I need a new job.

993
01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:12.698
Oh, my God.

994
01:32:13.949 --> 01:32:14.992
We're back.

995
01:32:27.921 --> 01:32:29.214
O'Connell.

996
01:32:41.768 --> 01:32:44.270
Oh, my God.

997
01:32:45.813 --> 01:32:49.317
Hey, Winston! Pedal faster!

998
01:32:52.028 --> 01:32:53.988
Hang on, men!

999
01:33:37.365 --> 01:33:39.367
Stop it! You'll kill them!

1000
01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:40.952
That's the idea.

1001
01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.679
Here I come, laddies!

1002
01:34:26.288 --> 01:34:28.415
I loved the whole sand-wall trick.

1003
01:34:28.498 --> 01:34:29.833
It was beautiful.

1004
01:34:29.916 --> 01:34:31.126
Bastard.

1005
01:34:48.518 --> 01:34:49.811
Excuse me?

1006
01:34:51.062 --> 01:34:56.568
Um, a little help would be useful,
if it's not too much trouble!

1007
01:34:58.361 --> 01:34:59.613
Yeah, yeah. All right.

1008
01:35:05.952 --> 01:35:08.371
Winston! Hey, Winston!

1009
01:35:23.178 --> 01:35:26.514
Quicksand! Get back! It's quicksand.

1010
01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:16.272
Keep moving!

1011
01:36:17.398 --> 01:36:20.317
You know,
nasty little fellows such as yourself

1012
01:36:20.401 --> 01:36:21.694
always get their comeuppance.

1013
01:36:21.777 --> 01:36:25.864
- Really? They do?
- Oh, yes.

1014
01:36:26.949 --> 01:36:27.866
Always.

1015
01:36:34.832 --> 01:36:37.960
Um, I'd take
those bigger stones first.

1016
01:36:38.043 --> 01:36:39.086
Take them from the top,

1017
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:41.213
otherwise the whole thing
will cave in on us.

1018
01:36:41.297 --> 01:36:42.965
Come on. Put your backs into it.

1019
01:36:45.175 --> 01:36:48.012
Yes, well, you've got the idea.
Chop, chop.

1020
01:36:56.853 --> 01:36:58.771
I say!

1021
01:37:01.774 --> 01:37:03.901
Gents, you should come
and have a look at this.

1022
01:37:12.869 --> 01:37:13.703
What?

1023
01:37:14.579 --> 01:37:16.122
It's in my arm! My arm!

1024
01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:19.584
Whoa!

1025
01:37:20.043 --> 01:37:21.669
- Do something!
- Hold it!

1026
01:37:21.753 --> 01:37:23.212
Do something! Do something!

1027
01:37:23.296 --> 01:37:24.714
Not that! Not that!

1028
01:37:35.141 --> 01:37:36.059
O'Connell.

1029
01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:04.545
Bembridge scholars never wrote about this.

1030
01:38:10.009 --> 01:38:12.387
Get off me. Get off!

1031
01:38:13.346 --> 01:38:14.639
Kill them...

1032
01:38:15.932 --> 01:38:18.101
...and wake the others.

1033
01:39:21.955 --> 01:39:23.540
- Can you see...
- Yeah.

1034
01:39:23.623 --> 01:39:25.500
- Can you believe...
- Yeah.

1035
01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:27.711
- Can we just...
- No.

1036
01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:41.766
- Who the hell are these guys?
- Priests.

1037
01:39:42.517 --> 01:39:44.019
Imhotep's priests.

1038
01:39:44.478 --> 01:39:45.312
All right, then.

1039
01:40:33.901 --> 01:40:35.152
There he is!

1040
01:40:36.612 --> 01:40:38.239
Hello, Horus, old boy.

1041
01:40:47.831 --> 01:40:48.958
Time to close the door.

1042
01:41:29.872 --> 01:41:31.749
Anck-Su-Namun.

1043
01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:41.718
O'Connell!

1044
01:41:42.885 --> 01:41:44.053
Jonathan!

1045
01:41:55.732 --> 01:41:57.442
Damn. These guys just don't quit, do they?

1046
01:41:58.443 --> 01:41:59.444
Keep digging.

1047
01:42:22.884 --> 01:42:25.428
The <i>Book of Amun-Ra.</i>

1048
01:42:33.645 --> 01:42:36.230
Save the girl. Kill the creature.

1049
01:42:49.326 --> 01:42:50.702
What are you waiting for?

1050
01:42:50.786 --> 01:42:53.038
Get out! Get out!

1051
01:43:01.004 --> 01:43:02.673
You all right? Let's go.

1052
01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:56.685
With your death, Anck-su-namun shall live.

1053
01:43:56.768 --> 01:43:58.228
And I shall be invincible!

1054
01:43:58.311 --> 01:44:01.398
The <i>Book of Amun-Ra!</i>
I found it, Evy! I found it!

1055
01:44:01.481 --> 01:44:03.233
The <i>Book of Amun-Ra.</i>

1056
01:44:03.316 --> 01:44:05.693
Shut up
and get me off here, Jonathan!

1057
01:44:06.694 --> 01:44:09.530
Open the book, Jonathan.
It's the only way to kill him.

1058
01:44:10.322 --> 01:44:13.075
You have to open the book
and find the inscription.

1059
01:44:13.159 --> 01:44:16.996
Well, I can't open it!
It's locked or something.

1060
01:44:18.748 --> 01:44:22.209
- We need the key, Evy!
- It's inside his robes.

1061
01:44:28.758 --> 01:44:29.842
O'Connell!

1062
01:45:02.124 --> 01:45:03.125
Mummies.

1063
01:45:15.012 --> 01:45:17.223
Look out! There's one there...
O'Connell!

1064
01:45:43.832 --> 01:45:44.958
Here's an inscription.

1065
01:46:04.686 --> 01:46:05.520
Oh, boy.

1066
01:46:13.111 --> 01:46:16.281
Oh, yeah.
This just keeps getting better and better.

1067
01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:19.450
- Do something, Jonathan.
- Me?

1068
01:46:19.534 --> 01:46:21.035
You can command them.

1069
01:46:21.119 --> 01:46:22.620
You have got to be joking.

1070
01:46:22.704 --> 01:46:24.414
Finish the inscription
on the cover, idiot,

1071
01:46:24.497 --> 01:46:25.874
then you can control them.

1072
01:46:25.957 --> 01:46:28.126
Oh. Right.

1073
01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:53.234
Uh-uh.

1074
01:47:05.537 --> 01:47:07.456
Hurry up, Jonathan!

1075
01:47:39.363 --> 01:47:40.989
I can't figure out this last symbol.

1076
01:47:41.073 --> 01:47:42.574
What does it look like?

1077
01:47:56.922 --> 01:48:00.300
It's a bird. A stork!

1078
01:48:13.188 --> 01:48:15.190
Ahmenophus.

1079
01:48:16.984 --> 01:48:18.235
Oh, yes, I see.

1080
01:48:49.515 --> 01:48:51.142
Destroy him!

1081
01:48:51.642 --> 01:48:52.727
Destroy him!

1082
01:48:54.311 --> 01:48:56.063
I command you to destroy him!

1083
01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.573
Anck-Su-Namun!

1084
01:49:10.661 --> 01:49:12.872
Give me that book!

1085
01:49:17.126 --> 01:49:18.753
Anck-Su-Namun!

1086
01:49:26.218 --> 01:49:27.511
Now you die.

1087
01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:48.908
Evy, I've got it.

1088
01:49:53.411 --> 01:49:54.537
Keep him busy.

1089
01:49:58.750 --> 01:49:59.709
No problem.

1090
01:50:12.722 --> 01:50:15.642
- Hurry, Evy! Hurry!
- You're not helping.

1091
01:50:19.145 --> 01:50:21.856
Now it's your turn.

1092
01:50:24.567 --> 01:50:25.860
Oh, I've got it!

1093
01:50:56.641 --> 01:50:58.935
I thought you said
it was gonna kill him!

1094
01:51:08.862 --> 01:51:09.988
He's mortal.

1095
01:51:45.522 --> 01:51:48.817
"Death is only the beginning."

1096
01:52:18.889 --> 01:52:20.390
Time to go.

1097
01:52:30.734 --> 01:52:33.445
You've lost the book!
Jonathan, I can't believe...

1098
01:52:33.528 --> 01:52:34.863
- Come on!
- Hurry!

1099
01:53:03.849 --> 01:53:05.977
- Oh, couldn't we just...
- No, Jonathan!

1100
01:53:13.317 --> 01:53:14.652
O'Connell!

1101
01:53:16.988 --> 01:53:20.491
- O'Connell! Wait!
- Come on, come on, come on!

1102
01:53:20.574 --> 01:53:23.369
- Wait! Please!
- Come on, come on! Beni!

1103
01:53:25.454 --> 01:53:26.539
Goodbye, Beni.

1104
01:54:05.161 --> 01:54:06.245
Go away.

1105
01:54:06.329 --> 01:54:08.080
Get back! Get back!

1106
01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:41.112
Go, go, go!

1107
01:55:27.033 --> 01:55:30.120
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

1108
01:55:30.203 --> 01:55:33.998
You have earned the respect
and gratitude of me and my people.

1109
01:55:34.082 --> 01:55:37.167
Yes, well... It was nothing.

1110
01:55:37.251 --> 01:55:39.044
May Allah smile upon you always.

1111
01:55:41.171 --> 01:55:43.674
And yourself.

1112
01:55:49.012 --> 01:55:52.433
Yes, anytime.
Stay out of trouble.

1113
01:55:53.684 --> 01:55:56.311
He's just leaving us here.

1114
01:56:00.691 --> 01:56:03.193
Well, I guess we go home empty-handed.

1115
01:56:03.277 --> 01:56:04.361
Again.

1116
01:56:04.445 --> 01:56:06.196
I wouldn't say that.

1117
01:56:08.782 --> 01:56:10.868
Oh, please!

1118
01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:22.546
How about you, darling?
Would you like a little kissy-wissy?

1119
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:24.465
Whew!
