00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:38.838
(proud music)

2
00:00:38.873 --> 00:00:45.185
(stars hum as they appear)

3
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.585
VO: Here we stand,
on the shoulders of giants.

4
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.488
These are our words

5
00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:55.657
and our sacred charge.

6
00:00:55.692 --> 00:00:59.364
Greatness is the foundation of
our world.

7
00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.433
Greatness let us survive
centuries of strife.

8
00:01:02.468 --> 00:01:04.534
Tame the world to our will,

9
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.901
and spread across the stars
at the speed of light.

10
00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:12.542
That same greatness may be in
you.

11
00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:16.546
Now it's time to find out.

12
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:19.417
Your Academies have nominated
you

13
00:01:19.452 --> 00:01:20.583
for your ambition,

14
00:01:20.618 --> 00:01:24.224
your drive, your potential for
greatness.

15
00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.457
It's time to prove yourself
worthy

16
00:01:26.492 --> 00:01:31.495
in the Sol Invictus games...

17
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.499
You and your team will
be cast across the stars

18
00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:36.896
to a pre-selected planet.

19
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.800
Your mission is a race against
time

20
00:01:39.835 --> 00:01:42.308
and a triumph of will.

21
00:01:42.343 --> 00:01:44.310
You are to set up camp

22
00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:46.543
establish a foothold for your
Academy

23
00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:49.810
and use all the tools at your
disposal.

24
00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:52.747
You are to search the sky and
pinpoint

25
00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:54.749
out of all the stars in the sky

26
00:01:54.784 --> 00:02:00.194
which is Earth's sun: Sol.

27
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:07.894
But be warned: only one team can
win

28
00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.798
and each Academy has sent their
best

29
00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:13.636
and brightest to compete against
you.

30
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:15.902
Your team Captain will lead you.

31
00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:18.278
Your Astronomer will search the
skies.

32
00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:20.511
And your team must form a
cohesive unit

33
00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:22.843
to have any hope of victory.

34
00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:27.947
We're strong together, broken
apart.

35
00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:31.324
Eternal glory awaits the winner.

36
00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.524
Use all the tools and wits you
have

37
00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.427
to prove your greatness.

38
00:02:35.462 --> 00:02:37.330
But move quickly.

39
00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:40.531
Only the victorious team may
return home.

40
00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:43.435
The cosmos are dark and
dangerous.

41
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.241
There's no room for mediocrity.

42
00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.773
Return a champion or not at all.

43
00:02:51.808 --> 00:02:55.480
Winning is the only rule.

44
00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:58.384
(powerful machinery roars to
life)

45
00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.453
VO: Welcome to Sol Invictus...

46
00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:06.689
(deafening roar)

47
00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:12.266
We have to turn it off!

48
00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:13.762
What about the rest of them?

49
00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:15.764
They haven't made it out yet!

50
00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.273
Leave 'em! The Slip Gate's gonna
collapse!

51
00:03:19.308 --> 00:03:23.739
(machinery roars angrily)

52
00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:25.774
I can fix this!

53
00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:29.745
Take this!

54
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.847
(roaring machinery)

55
00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:34.321
(crash)

56
00:03:34.356 --> 00:03:35.388
(ears ringing)

57
00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.587
They're still inside!

58
00:03:36.622 --> 00:03:38.688
Look out!

59
00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:40.690
That's all I can do!

60
00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:43.495
Clear out! Run!

61
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.564
(screaming)

62
00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.567
(machine turbulence builds)

63
00:03:49.602 --> 00:03:51.569
(BANG)

64
00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:55.474
(ears ringing)

65
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.972
(faint breeze)

66
00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:02.877
(tenuous music)

67
00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:16.022
Okay listen up.

68
00:04:16.057 --> 00:04:17.826
Something must have happened to
the gate.

69
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:19.828
The rest of our teams haven't
come through.

70
00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:22.864
Am I the only Team Captain?

71
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.405
Eli?

72
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:28.639
What are you doing here?

73
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:30.608
I came out.

74
00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:32.379
With Virgo Academy.

75
00:04:32.414 --> 00:04:35.448
Is anyone here a Team Engineer?

76
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.944
What's your name?

77
00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.815
Ira. From Aries Academy.

78
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.817
Come with me.

79
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.635
(low machine rumbling)

80
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.440
The rest of my team,
they hadn't come through yet!

81
00:05:00.475 --> 00:05:01.771
My brother was with them.

82
00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:03.773
Mine too. Listen to me, Ira.

83
00:05:03.808 --> 00:05:05.511
Can you get the rest of my team
through?

84
00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:08.514
I don't know. I've never
worked a Slip Gate before.

85
00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:09.812
They don't teach us how.

86
00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:11.583
I need you to try. Try hard.

87
00:05:11.618 --> 00:05:14.355
I still have a competition to
win.

88
00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:17.457
I think...

89
00:05:17.492 --> 00:05:19.756
I think it's broken on our end.

90
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:22.022
(machinery roars)

91
00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.671
Hey!

92
00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:35.068
Pick it up.

93
00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:36.740
What?

94
00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:39.446
You're a Team Chronicle.
You need to record this!

95
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:40.645
There's nothing to record.

96
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.647
My team didn't make it through.

97
00:05:42.682 --> 00:05:44.616
There's enough of my team to
compete.

98
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:47.553
We need a Chronicle to prove our
win.

99
00:05:47.588 --> 00:05:48.851
You're one of us now, shrimp.

100
00:05:48.886 --> 00:05:49.918
My name's Kit!

101
00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:51.458
Kyle Ian Troy.

102
00:05:51.493 --> 00:05:54.725
Well now you're a Gemini, Kit.

103
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.156
Now pick it up!

104
00:06:02.702 --> 00:06:04.702
Lee?

105
00:06:05.672 --> 00:06:07.936
What about the rest of them?

106
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:09.938
Leave 'em.

107
00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:11.940
They're just dead weight.

108
00:06:11.975 --> 00:06:14.074
A lot of our team didn't make it
through.

109
00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:16.780
We could use the extra hands.

110
00:06:16.815 --> 00:06:19.750
The rest of you, you're coming
with us.

111
00:06:19.785 --> 00:06:22.654
You're all from Gemini now.

112
00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:25.591
I'm not on your team.

113
00:06:26.627 --> 00:06:28.462
Why should I follow you?

114
00:06:28.497 --> 00:06:29.925
Your teammates aren't coming.

115
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.597
Face it.

116
00:06:31.632 --> 00:06:35.029
Come with us and you may
get credit as part of our team.

117
00:06:35.064 --> 00:06:37.097
Don't want to be one of us? Then
stay.

118
00:06:37.132 --> 00:06:39.473
You can be our competition...

119
00:06:39.508 --> 00:06:41.640
Your call.

120
00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:59.020
(eerie music)

121
00:06:59.055 --> 00:07:00.857
This isn't right.

122
00:07:00.892 --> 00:07:04.025
The games are supposed
to be on a forest world.

123
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.500
Make sure to include
that in your Chronicle.

124
00:07:06.535 --> 00:07:09.162
Judges won't believe this
unless they see proof.

125
00:07:09.197 --> 00:07:14.134
Maybe we'll get a special
honor for winning out here.

126
00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.203
Do you think this happened
to the girl's Games too?

127
00:07:17.238 --> 00:07:20.646
We'd have heard wouldn't we?

128
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:29.281
If we're going to find Sol
first we need to set up,

129
00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:31.283
learn the area.

130
00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:33.285
Scouts, this way. Scour the
place.

131
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.529
Find anything that might be
useful.

132
00:07:37.962 --> 00:07:39.797
I know you!

133
00:07:39.832 --> 00:07:41.667
You're the guy that won last
year.

134
00:07:41.702 --> 00:07:43.570
You won Sol Invictus!

135
00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:47.134
But... You were disqualified
weren't you?

136
00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:50.643
That's right! You were DQ'd for
cheating.

137
00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:53.239
Must have been embarrassing
to have that taken away.

138
00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:55.241
I'd watch what I was saying

139
00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:58.013
if I didn't have my team here
to back me up...

140
00:07:58.048 --> 00:07:59.619
Maybe you should.

141
00:07:59.654 --> 00:08:02.754
You two, you know each other?

142
00:08:04.153 --> 00:08:05.185
We used to.

143
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.220
What class are you?

144
00:08:06.254 --> 00:08:07.594
Astronomer.

145
00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:09.024
I'm Eli from Virgo.

146
00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:11.026
We've already got an Astronomer.

147
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:13.028
Lee, should we drop this one?

148
00:08:13.063 --> 00:08:14.161
What about you?

149
00:08:14.196 --> 00:08:15.162
Me?

150
00:08:15.197 --> 00:08:16.801
You're scouts now.

151
00:08:16.836 --> 00:08:18.902
Find everything you can about
this place.

152
00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:21.740
But we don't have weapons.
What if it's dangerous?

153
00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:23.742
Then you'll be the first to
know.

154
00:08:23.777 --> 00:08:25.744
Strength in numbers, right?

155
00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:28.076
Rest of you scouts, let's move
out!

156
00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:30.243
I want camp set up before
sunset!

157
00:08:30.278 --> 00:08:33.983
We've got a lot of stars to
search through.

158
00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:40.792
This could go on for miles.

159
00:08:40.827 --> 00:08:43.256
And I think the air is thinner
out here.

160
00:08:45.766 --> 00:08:49.295
(optimistic music)

161
00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:53.739
They're not going to send
any search parties.

162
00:08:53.774 --> 00:08:55.741
They don't send help.

163
00:08:55.776 --> 00:08:58.106
But we're on the wrong planet.
Won't they come looking?

164
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:01.846
You sure they know something's
wrong?

165
00:09:01.881 --> 00:09:03.045
(deep rumbling)

166
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.047
Did you hear that? Listen...

167
00:09:05.082 --> 00:09:07.654
(deep rumbling)

168
00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:11.658
Eli, wait!

169
00:09:13.827 --> 00:09:16.894
(tense music)

170
00:09:16.929 --> 00:09:19.666
(sweeping music)

171
00:09:19.701 --> 00:09:21.899
An ocean?!

172
00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:25.001
I've never seen a real one
before...

173
00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:34.846
How much do you think
this is worth back home?

174
00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:36.980
Hard to tell.

175
00:09:37.015 --> 00:09:39.213
It could go on forever.

176
00:09:39.248 --> 00:09:42.018
But it's fresh water that they
need.

177
00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:44.988
What should we do about the
Geminis?

178
00:09:45.023 --> 00:09:47.023
Should we run?

179
00:09:47.729 --> 00:09:49.927
Then what?

180
00:09:55.704 --> 00:09:57.231
Don't say that to me!

181
00:09:57.266 --> 00:09:59.233
What do you mean there's no
food?

182
00:09:59.268 --> 00:10:00.432
You're the Chef.

183
00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:03.039
It's your job to make sure
everyone is fed!

184
00:10:03.074 --> 00:10:05.041
I know that.

185
00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:08.209
It's just: all our food
was with the Porters.

186
00:10:09.078 --> 00:10:13.181
I've got a few essentials but
nothing else.

187
00:10:14.921 --> 00:10:17.889
There's not enough for
everyone...

188
00:10:28.264 --> 00:10:30.000
(creature snarl)

189
00:10:42.113 --> 00:10:44.410
(twig snaps)

190
00:10:44.445 --> 00:10:48.216
(animal breathing nearby)

191
00:10:48.251 --> 00:10:53.254
(creatures chirping)

192
00:10:53.289 --> 00:10:57.027
(creatures hissing)

193
00:11:05.939 --> 00:11:10.876
(creatures communicating)

194
00:11:12.176 --> 00:11:15.243
(creatures growls)

195
00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:17.377
(ominous music)

196
00:11:17.412 --> 00:11:20.380
(creature growls angrily)

197
00:11:20.415 --> 00:11:22.382
(child screams)

198
00:11:22.417 --> 00:11:25.253
(creatures roar, children
scream)

199
00:11:25.288 --> 00:11:28.157
Kit! What are you doing?!
Record this!

200
00:11:28.192 --> 00:11:31.963
(sounds of chaos in camp)

201
00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:40.466
We have to go!

202
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:42.875
If we get to water maybe they
can't swim!

203
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.844
I'm not going out there!

204
00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:46.417
If we get to the ocean we might
make it!

205
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:49.409
We can't make it!

206
00:11:49.444 --> 00:11:52.379
(screams and roars in
background)

207
00:11:57.287 --> 00:12:00.453
(gasping)

208
00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:09.803
(creatures and screams in
distance)

209
00:12:09.838 --> 00:12:13.400
(tragic music)

210
00:12:16.042 --> 00:12:20.880
(frantic splashing)

211
00:12:28.923 --> 00:12:32.452
(creatures roar in distance)

212
00:12:47.205 --> 00:12:53.440
(eerie music)

213
00:13:33.647 --> 00:13:36.153
(branches snap)

214
00:13:37.123 --> 00:13:39.519
You made it! How?

215
00:13:39.554 --> 00:13:41.356
Spent the night in a tree.

216
00:13:41.391 --> 00:13:44.326
Those - whatever they are -
hunters

217
00:13:44.361 --> 00:13:46.625
lost interest in me a few hours
ago.

218
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.903
Took the rest and left.

219
00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:57.471
It's still running!

220
00:13:57.506 --> 00:14:00.111
(screaming from camera)

221
00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:02.509
Maybe we can see... what
happened.

222
00:14:02.544 --> 00:14:05.446
No one should see what those
things do.

223
00:14:08.253 --> 00:14:10.484
Just the four of us?

224
00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:12.519
We're all that made it?

225
00:14:12.554 --> 00:14:14.257
What are you doing?!

226
00:14:14.292 --> 00:14:16.028
You can't just leave.

227
00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:18.294
Look what staying in a group
got the rest of them.

228
00:14:18.329 --> 00:14:20.329
I'm going solo.

229
00:14:20.364 --> 00:14:22.331
I got to camp first so this
stuff is mine.

230
00:14:22.366 --> 00:14:24.333
That's not fair you were
the first to run too!

231
00:14:24.368 --> 00:14:25.368
This stuff is mine!

232
00:14:25.402 --> 00:14:26.940
You want to prove it, shrimp?

233
00:14:26.975 --> 00:14:28.007
My name is Kit!

234
00:14:28.042 --> 00:14:28.975
Keep quiet!

235
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.977
We're not splitting up.

236
00:14:31.012 --> 00:14:34.574
If the Geminis can put
together a team so can we.

237
00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:37.247
They didn't know about
the Hunters but now we do.

238
00:14:37.282 --> 00:14:38.644
We don't even have half a team.

239
00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:41.086
You know the rules...

240
00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:45.618
There's still a team
as long as there's a Captain.

241
00:14:45.653 --> 00:14:47.620
I know the rules.

242
00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:50.128
You're an Astronomer.
I don't have to listen to you.

243
00:14:50.163 --> 00:14:52.427
Don't listen to me then.

244
00:14:53.265 --> 00:14:55.133
Listen to Tyl.

245
00:14:55.168 --> 00:14:57.938
He's the only Team Captain now.

246
00:15:01.438 --> 00:15:02.976
What are you doing!?

247
00:15:03.011 --> 00:15:06.078
I want as many eyes watching
my back as possible.

248
00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:08.542
The best chance we have
is if we stick together, right?

249
00:15:08.577 --> 00:15:09.741
Yeah but-

250
00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:12.183
Then you have to force them into
a team!

251
00:15:12.218 --> 00:15:14.218
But I'm not a Captain!

252
00:15:16.717 --> 00:15:20.488
(hopeful music)

253
00:15:21.623 --> 00:15:23.491
You are now.

254
00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:26.230
So start acting like it.

255
00:15:28.036 --> 00:15:29.497
The games are over!

256
00:15:29.532 --> 00:15:32.104
There's gotta be someone
here with a communicator.

257
00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:33.468
I'm calling home.

258
00:15:33.503 --> 00:15:35.767
If someone was out here
we'd have seen them.

259
00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:37.505
We're alone.

260
00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.177
Then what are we supposed to do?

261
00:15:39.212 --> 00:15:40.378
We still have a telescope.

262
00:15:40.413 --> 00:15:42.741
We followed the Geminis because
they were supposed to win

263
00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:44.413
and get us picked up.

264
00:15:44.448 --> 00:15:45.645
We'll just do the same.

265
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.713
And those Hunters?

266
00:15:46.748 --> 00:15:50.221
We'll stick to the shore
so we can see them coming.

267
00:15:50.256 --> 00:15:51.717
Maybe they can't swim.

268
00:15:51.752 --> 00:15:54.225
Scorpius team is still out
there...

269
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.162
They'll finish what those
Hunters started.

270
00:15:57.197 --> 00:15:59.428
I'm safer hiding on my own.

271
00:15:59.463 --> 00:16:03.630
Do me a favor and stay away from
me.

272
00:16:08.076 --> 00:16:11.374
Just because we're in this
together doesn't mean we're a team.

273
00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:13.475
I'm only following you
because you have the scope.

274
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.741
I don't think so...

275
00:16:16.243 --> 00:16:18.249
Tyl, the lens is cracked.

276
00:16:18.284 --> 00:16:20.251
What?!

277
00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:23.518
See? Crack runs the whole
length.

278
00:16:23.553 --> 00:16:26.257
Great! You couldn't spot shit
with that!

279
00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:27.753
Now what, Team Captain!?

280
00:16:27.788 --> 00:16:29.194
(distant explosion)

281
00:16:29.229 --> 00:16:30.723
Rescue party!

282
00:16:30.758 --> 00:16:34.364
(machinery howls in distance)

283
00:16:36.632 --> 00:16:39.138
Do you see anything!?

284
00:16:39.173 --> 00:16:42.108
(ominous music)

285
00:16:42.143 --> 00:16:44.440
Guys?

286
00:16:44.475 --> 00:16:46.574
We're not alone out here...

287
00:16:49.513 --> 00:16:52.184
What do you mean?

288
00:16:52.686 --> 00:16:55.451
See for yourself.

289
00:16:57.521 --> 00:16:59.851
Doesn't look like a rescue
party.

290
00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:01.391
Should we talk to him?

291
00:17:01.426 --> 00:17:02.459
I don't know.

292
00:17:02.494 --> 00:17:05.692
I've heard stories about
strange people off-world.

293
00:17:05.727 --> 00:17:08.332
What's he doing here?

294
00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:16.571
Whatever you do, you better
hurry.

295
00:17:21.578 --> 00:17:23.677
(Kit screams)

296
00:17:23.712 --> 00:17:25.250
Where are you from!?

297
00:17:25.285 --> 00:17:26.449
Scorpius? Virgo? Corona?

298
00:17:26.484 --> 00:17:27.524
I'm not from any of those!

299
00:17:27.552 --> 00:17:29.716
Did you kill somebody who was
and take his gear?

300
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:31.157
It's nothing like that!

301
00:17:31.192 --> 00:17:32.818
I'll be the judge of that!

302
00:17:35.328 --> 00:17:37.295
You don't know what
you're doing! Let go of me!

303
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.626
You don't know what you're
doing!

304
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:40.694
You can't trust the other
Academies!

305
00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:43.433
I know! But he's not from an
Academy.

306
00:17:47.802 --> 00:17:48.935
How'd you get here?

307
00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.409
I was late for the start so
they just sent me through.

308
00:17:52.444 --> 00:17:54.642
Did they say anything about
trouble with the Gates?!

309
00:17:54.677 --> 00:17:57.414
No it was business as usual.
Why?

310
00:17:57.449 --> 00:17:59.812
Do you have a communicator?

311
00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:02.881
My teammates have all that.

312
00:18:03.554 --> 00:18:05.884
Where's my team?

313
00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.822
They didn't make it.

314
00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:13.595
You can be sad later.
We need to find a way home.

315
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.334
Do you have any equipment we can
use?

316
00:18:16.369 --> 00:18:19.469
It was all broken when I
got here so I dropped it.

317
00:18:19.504 --> 00:18:21.537
Where did you leave it?

318
00:18:21.572 --> 00:18:23.803
There was nothing worthwhile
left.

319
00:18:23.838 --> 00:18:25.409
I'm positive.

320
00:18:25.444 --> 00:18:27.774
We'll be the judge of that.

321
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:32.911
(hopeful music)

322
00:18:34.288 --> 00:18:36.915
There it is.

323
00:18:40.393 --> 00:18:42.492
That's close enough!

324
00:18:42.527 --> 00:18:45.297
(energy gun charging)

325
00:18:45.332 --> 00:18:46.727
(ominous music)

326
00:18:46.762 --> 00:18:48.366
Where's the rest of your team?

327
00:18:48.401 --> 00:18:49.895
I hid.

328
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.205
The rest didn't.

329
00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.834
But it looks like my fortunes
have turned.

330
00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:56.572
Step back.

331
00:18:56.607 --> 00:18:58.277
How'd you get a gun through the
Gate?

332
00:18:58.312 --> 00:19:00.279
Made it with his stuff.

333
00:19:00.314 --> 00:19:02.974
That's all the valuables the
half-wit left.

334
00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:05.515
Gate must have ruined the rest.

335
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.254
But you seem like a guy
with a lot more to give.

336
00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:09.453
What do you want?

337
00:19:09.488 --> 00:19:11.455
Your telescope for starters.

338
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.325
Mine needs some parts

339
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.228
and you're gonna give them to
me.

340
00:19:15.263 --> 00:19:17.230
Is this all in your party?

341
00:19:17.265 --> 00:19:19.595
You got a camp nearby?

342
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.927
You're gonna give me all your
belongings

343
00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:25.271
and I'll consider letting
you live to be rescued.

344
00:19:25.306 --> 00:19:27.900
We're dead without our stuff
and you know it.

345
00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:29.308
Not my problem.

346
00:19:29.343 --> 00:19:31.673
No. You can't have it.

347
00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:34.445
Show me your camp or I can just

348
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.514
kill you and find it myself!

349
00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:40.286
(gun charges louder)

350
00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:41.087
He's a kid!

351
00:19:41.122 --> 00:19:42.618
He'll just die on his own
anyway.

352
00:19:42.653 --> 00:19:45.357
You need parts and so do we.

353
00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:48.261
Does your telescope have a lens?

354
00:19:48.296 --> 00:19:51.429
Put it in ours and we can work
together.

355
00:19:51.464 --> 00:19:54.465
We can all go home tonight.

356
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.699
(gun powers down)

357
00:19:58.834 --> 00:20:01.967
Tell your friend to come over.

358
00:20:12.617 --> 00:20:17.422
(ocarina music)

359
00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:21.789
You didn't bring a tent
but you brought that?

360
00:20:22.458 --> 00:20:25.397
It helps me when I'm nervous.

361
00:20:25.632 --> 00:20:27.960
Tyl, you're Team Captain.

362
00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:29.995
You get first try.

363
00:20:31.966 --> 00:20:36.672
(telescope interface boots up)

364
00:20:36.707 --> 00:20:40.478
(hopeful music)

365
00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:53.557
Let me show you how it's done!

366
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:02.368
There it is.

367
00:21:04.504 --> 00:21:05.437
(negative)

368
00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:07.065
What?!

369
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.836
This thing is broken!

370
00:21:08.871 --> 00:21:10.101
You rigged it!

371
00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:12.840
Would we really rig it to cheat
ourselves?

372
00:21:26.823 --> 00:21:30.363
We can't do this without
the rest of our teams.

373
00:21:30.398 --> 00:21:32.365
We need their equipment.

374
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.896
What else can we do? We have to
try.

375
00:21:36.866 --> 00:21:39.372
(negative beeps)

376
00:21:39.407 --> 00:21:42.705
I have no idea where Sol is. Do
you?

377
00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.444
(negative beeps)

378
00:21:47.745 --> 00:21:49.844
(negative beeps)

379
00:21:49.879 --> 00:21:51.846
Why can't you just find it?

380
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:53.386
We have no tools!

381
00:21:53.421 --> 00:21:54.849
No idea where we are

382
00:21:54.884 --> 00:21:57.852
and no idea where our sun is
hiding!

383
00:21:57.887 --> 00:21:59.590
You're so smart?

384
00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:01.526
Find it yourself.

385
00:22:12.836 --> 00:22:14.704
(negative beeps)

386
00:22:14.739 --> 00:22:16.706
Can I sleep in here?

387
00:22:16.741 --> 00:22:18.708
(lonely music)

388
00:22:18.743 --> 00:22:20.743
(negative beeps)

389
00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:25.077
Come on, Kit.

390
00:22:25.112 --> 00:22:27.178
We need to rest.

391
00:22:27.213 --> 00:22:29.422
(negative beeps)

392
00:22:34.154 --> 00:22:36.990
(negative beeps)

393
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.030
(negative beeps)

394
00:22:44.065 --> 00:22:48.573
Come on Kit, we'll look again
tomorrow.

395
00:22:49.576 --> 00:22:53.072
(negative beeps)

396
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.827
Do you think rescue ships
will scout this area soon?

397
00:23:11.862 --> 00:23:14.192
I don't think they know
anything's wrong.

398
00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:16.194
Even if they did

399
00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:19.197
it could take months for them to
find us.

400
00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:22.068
Maybe years...

401
00:23:22.403 --> 00:23:25.874
We'll just have to survive
long enough to win.

402
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:29.713
They put us in teams
for the best chance of survival.

403
00:23:29.748 --> 00:23:31.715
We're gonna keep doing it that
way.

404
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.013
Hal, you're a cook right?

405
00:23:33.048 --> 00:23:34.817
It's your job to make sure we
can eat.

406
00:23:34.852 --> 00:23:36.984
But there's nothing out there!
I can't work like this!

407
00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:38.249
None of us should have to.

408
00:23:38.284 --> 00:23:41.021
We all have to pickup duties
we didn't want.

409
00:23:41.056 --> 00:23:44.024
Adrian, you're offense?
Find anything you can out here.

410
00:23:44.059 --> 00:23:45.564
Especially water...

411
00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:47.566
I'm Security against other
teams.

412
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:49.568
That makes me second in command.

413
00:23:49.603 --> 00:23:50.899
You can't reassign me.

414
00:23:50.934 --> 00:23:53.605
All the other teams are dead.

415
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.607
You're a Scout now.

416
00:23:55.642 --> 00:23:57.609
Lex, you're a Technician.

417
00:23:57.644 --> 00:23:59.611
Kit, you're a Chronicle?

418
00:23:59.646 --> 00:24:00.445
Keep recording.

419
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.747
If we do get back you're the
only one

420
00:24:03.782 --> 00:24:05.782
that can prove we didn't cheat.

421
00:24:05.817 --> 00:24:07.817
We're all a team now.

422
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.130
(lonely music)

423
00:24:32.844 --> 00:24:34.910
Gone...

424
00:24:34.945 --> 00:24:36.912
It's all gone.

425
00:24:36.947 --> 00:24:39.112
There has to be good water
somewhere.

426
00:24:39.147 --> 00:24:40.883
We just have to find it.

427
00:24:40.918 --> 00:24:42.951
What are we supposed to do till
then?

428
00:24:42.986 --> 00:24:44.953
Stop sweating?

429
00:24:45.155 --> 00:24:48.220
I can't keep going on like this.

430
00:24:50.829 --> 00:24:52.191
He's got water!

431
00:24:52.226 --> 00:24:53.192
What?

432
00:24:53.227 --> 00:24:54.963
There! In his jacket!

433
00:24:54.998 --> 00:24:56.965
I don't have any water!

434
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.736
If I did I wouldn't share it
with you...

435
00:24:58.771 --> 00:24:59.935
His lips are wet.

436
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.574
You think I've got water?

437
00:25:01.609 --> 00:25:02.839
Try and take it.

438
00:25:02.874 --> 00:25:04.874
See what happens.

439
00:25:14.215 --> 00:25:17.282
Howard, wait!

440
00:25:17.317 --> 00:25:19.317
(eerie music)

441
00:25:23.224 --> 00:25:28.029
Don't drink that!
You're gonna make it worse!

442
00:25:29.263 --> 00:25:32.638
It's fresh...

443
00:25:34.675 --> 00:25:36.235
Fresh! It's fresh!

444
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.237
Fresh water!

445
00:25:38.272 --> 00:25:40.239
Can you imagine what
this is worth back home?

446
00:25:40.274 --> 00:25:42.109
They could stop drilling the
moon.

447
00:25:42.144 --> 00:25:43.682
And Europa...

448
00:25:43.717 --> 00:25:45.981
This could change everything!

449
00:25:46.016 --> 00:25:47.818
(laughter)

450
00:25:47.853 --> 00:25:49.820
How could they have missed this?

451
00:25:49.855 --> 00:25:52.790
The Gate must have been built
before the oceans dried.

452
00:25:52.825 --> 00:25:54.660
They weren't looking.

453
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:56.992
(splashing)

454
00:25:59.326 --> 00:26:04.263
(hopeful music)

455
00:26:15.078 --> 00:26:18.310
(screams outside)

456
00:26:18.345 --> 00:26:20.312
Lex!

457
00:26:20.347 --> 00:26:21.918
(telescope buzzing)

458
00:26:21.953 --> 00:26:23.183
Hold him down!

459
00:26:23.218 --> 00:26:25.185
Kit! Water now!

460
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.693
Kit, come on!

461
00:26:27.728 --> 00:26:30.729
(gasping, coughing)

462
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.096
What happened?

463
00:26:35.131 --> 00:26:38.429
I don't know. I don't know...

464
00:26:38.464 --> 00:26:41.300
I was just trying to find Sol

465
00:26:41.335 --> 00:26:44.204
and the damn thing shocked me!

466
00:26:44.239 --> 00:26:46.206
Nice job putting it together.

467
00:26:46.241 --> 00:26:48.208
You trying to kill me?!

468
00:26:48.243 --> 00:26:50.782
What's this for?

469
00:26:51.719 --> 00:26:54.313
Part of the scope is open.

470
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.053
You were trying to cheat!

471
00:26:58.088 --> 00:27:00.825
You tried tricking it
to think you found Sol!

472
00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.354
But scopes are tamper proof!

473
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:04.895
Yeah it shocked him in defense!

474
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.864
Does it still work!?

475
00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:09.867
(scope powers up)

476
00:27:09.902 --> 00:27:11.132
Yeah.

477
00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:13.134
We should throw him out.

478
00:27:13.169 --> 00:27:15.741
Before he pulls something like
this again.

479
00:27:15.776 --> 00:27:16.973
Lex?

480
00:27:17.008 --> 00:27:20.845
Do it! I dare you!

481
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.884
You need me as much as I need
your stuff.

482
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.285
That's what I thought.

483
00:27:34.454 --> 00:27:36.828
Thanks for the water!

484
00:27:36.863 --> 00:27:39.259
You're not letting him get
away with that are you?

485
00:27:39.294 --> 00:27:41.261
You have to kick him out!

486
00:27:41.296 --> 00:27:42.460
I'm not doing that!

487
00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:44.737
What if he cheats again, or does
worse?

488
00:27:44.772 --> 00:27:45.671
What will you do?

489
00:27:45.707 --> 00:27:48.037
Maybe we'll need his help! I
don't know-

490
00:27:48.072 --> 00:27:49.775
What do you know?!

491
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.942
Have you ever led anyone?

492
00:27:51.977 --> 00:27:54.373
How long have you even been a
Team Captain?

493
00:27:55.211 --> 00:27:57.178
No.

494
00:27:57.213 --> 00:27:59.213
You can't handle this.

495
00:28:07.058 --> 00:28:11.027
(tenuous music)

496
00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:23.534
Look for a clearing.

497
00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:26.207
Any opening big enough to gather
logs.

498
00:28:26.242 --> 00:28:28.308
But we have a light,
we don't need to build a fire.

499
00:28:28.343 --> 00:28:29.540
Not for that!

500
00:28:29.575 --> 00:28:30.948
Then what?

501
00:28:30.983 --> 00:28:33.412
We're not making a fire, kid.

502
00:28:33.447 --> 00:28:34.820
It's for a boat.

503
00:28:34.855 --> 00:28:36.085
Why?

504
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.087
We're leaving.

505
00:28:38.122 --> 00:28:42.421
Do you really want to stay
with those Hunters?

506
00:28:43.358 --> 00:28:45.061
What if this is the only land?

507
00:28:45.096 --> 00:28:46.799
You'd rather wait here to be
eaten?

508
00:28:46.834 --> 00:28:48.064
Look...

509
00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:51.199
This can't be the only land.

510
00:28:51.234 --> 00:28:53.971
Someone's gotta be out there.

511
00:28:54.006 --> 00:28:55.335
And we can find 'em.

512
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.371
And contact home.

513
00:28:59.209 --> 00:29:00.912
Now go.

514
00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:04.410
Find logs. Get good ones.

515
00:29:16.292 --> 00:29:18.226
(slithering sounds)

516
00:29:18.261 --> 00:29:20.525
(creature roars)

517
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.527
(screams)

518
00:29:22.562 --> 00:29:25.904
(frantic music)

519
00:29:26.434 --> 00:29:27.565
(gasps)

520
00:29:28.634 --> 00:29:31.338
I can't hold on!

521
00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:33.979
Lex!

522
00:29:34.013 --> 00:29:35.375
I'm slipping!

523
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.377
Somebody help me!

524
00:29:37.412 --> 00:29:39.049
Anybody!

525
00:29:39.084 --> 00:29:40.215
Help!

526
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:41.854
(creature hisses)

527
00:29:41.889 --> 00:29:43.856
Hang on!

528
00:29:43.891 --> 00:29:45.858
It's gonna pull us in too!

529
00:29:45.893 --> 00:29:47.222
Help!

530
00:29:47.257 --> 00:29:49.191
(creature hisses)

531
00:29:49.226 --> 00:29:51.226
(screams)

532
00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.999
(gun charges)

533
00:29:55.034 --> 00:29:56.330
(BANG)

534
00:29:56.365 --> 00:29:59.135
(creature screams)

535
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.940
(creature flees)

536
00:30:02.569 --> 00:30:05.306
(panicked gasping)

537
00:30:05.341 --> 00:30:08.375
(pained winces)

538
00:30:10.676 --> 00:30:14.612
(tense music)

539
00:30:19.157 --> 00:30:21.058
Tyl, help us!

540
00:30:21.093 --> 00:30:24.094
We need your help! Hurry!

541
00:30:24.129 --> 00:30:27.460
(pained screams)

542
00:30:29.398 --> 00:30:32.102
(screams)

543
00:30:32.537 --> 00:30:34.874
I think he's poisoned.

544
00:30:35.701 --> 00:30:37.943
It's killing him.

545
00:30:37.978 --> 00:30:39.978
(gasping)

546
00:30:40.442 --> 00:30:42.343
What do we do?!

547
00:30:44.512 --> 00:30:46.578
Right here!

548
00:30:47.013 --> 00:30:49.383
The med-pack!

549
00:30:51.959 --> 00:30:53.959
Here!

550
00:30:54.861 --> 00:30:58.458
The venom's bad.
I don't know if he'll make it!

551
00:30:58.493 --> 00:31:01.692
Here, you clean the wound!

552
00:31:01.727 --> 00:31:04.937
(tense music)

553
00:31:04.972 --> 00:31:07.599
(screams)

554
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:11.702
Where's the sting kit!?

555
00:31:11.737 --> 00:31:13.946
I'm looking!

556
00:31:14.281 --> 00:31:16.542
Oh no. It's broken!

557
00:31:16.577 --> 00:31:18.544
Are there more?

558
00:31:18.579 --> 00:31:20.546
Hurry!

559
00:31:20.581 --> 00:31:23.153
This is our last one.

560
00:31:23.188 --> 00:31:26.420
Wait! We gotta save it.

561
00:31:26.455 --> 00:31:27.421
What?!

562
00:31:27.456 --> 00:31:28.994
What if one of us gets stung?

563
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:30.424
He's right.

564
00:31:30.459 --> 00:31:33.130
Use it now and you won't
have one for yourself later.

565
00:31:33.165 --> 00:31:36.001
But he's hurt now!

566
00:31:36.465 --> 00:31:39.103
Use it, Tyl!

567
00:31:39.138 --> 00:31:42.205
(snap, medical hiss)

568
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.637
(screams subside)

569
00:31:45.672 --> 00:31:49.245
(music fades away)

570
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.985
Think there could be
more of those things, Lex?

571
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.220
If we're stuck here
it's not long till we find out.

572
00:32:04.493 --> 00:32:07.593
We're not going to
make it out of here are we?

573
00:32:10.664 --> 00:32:14.369
(pained moans)

574
00:32:14.404 --> 00:32:17.603
(loud groaning)

575
00:32:19.178 --> 00:32:21.673
(pained screams)

576
00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:24.709
How long will this last?

577
00:32:24.744 --> 00:32:26.612
(loud yell)

578
00:32:26.647 --> 00:32:29.384
(creatures howl in distance)

579
00:32:29.419 --> 00:32:30.748
(howls, closer)

580
00:32:30.783 --> 00:32:32.750
They're coming!

581
00:32:32.785 --> 00:32:34.752
(tense music)

582
00:32:34.787 --> 00:32:36.754
(loud moans)

583
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:38.756
(creatures call in response)

584
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:40.725
I'm not staying here. Not again!

585
00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.298
Me neither!

586
00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:44.300
He'll bring the Hunters right to
us!

587
00:32:44.335 --> 00:32:45.268
(loud, pained moans)

588
00:32:45.303 --> 00:32:46.135
Leave him!

589
00:32:46.171 --> 00:32:48.304
Someone has to stay and keep him
quiet

590
00:32:48.339 --> 00:32:50.306
or they'll find him for sure!

591
00:32:50.341 --> 00:32:52.638
(Hunters howl, getting closer)

592
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.212
Eli's the only one that
doesn't do his job anymore.

593
00:32:55.247 --> 00:32:56.642
He's least essential.

594
00:32:56.677 --> 00:32:57.509
Hey! I-

595
00:32:57.545 --> 00:33:01.350
I record, Hal cooks, Lex fixes
things

596
00:33:01.385 --> 00:33:02.747
and Tyl saves people.

597
00:33:02.782 --> 00:33:05.750
Have you found Sol yet?

598
00:33:05.785 --> 00:33:08.588
No but I try every night!

599
00:33:08.623 --> 00:33:10.161
He's right, Eli.

600
00:33:10.196 --> 00:33:12.163
You're the least important.

601
00:33:12.198 --> 00:33:14.495
Stay here with Adrian.

602
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.794
Okay...

603
00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:18.796
Lex, is that gun still in your
pack?

604
00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:20.798
No, stay out of my pack!

605
00:33:20.833 --> 00:33:22.800
Leave it! No time!

606
00:33:22.835 --> 00:33:25.836
(Hunters howl in distance)

607
00:33:25.871 --> 00:33:29.642
(ominous music)

608
00:33:33.747 --> 00:33:39.718
(Hunters sniffing nearby)

609
00:33:47.761 --> 00:33:49.860
(Hunters calling)

610
00:33:49.895 --> 00:33:52.500
There! At our camp.

611
00:33:52.535 --> 00:33:55.569
(Hunters sniffing nearby)

612
00:33:55.604 --> 00:33:57.373
(electronic beeps)

613
00:33:57.408 --> 00:33:59.375
What are you doing?

614
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.377
(electronics powering up)

615
00:34:01.412 --> 00:34:05.843
(Hunters roar)

616
00:34:05.878 --> 00:34:09.682
(Hunters howling)

617
00:34:09.717 --> 00:34:14.687
If they go after Eli then
they won't come after us.

618
00:34:14.722 --> 00:34:17.690
(Hunters roaring)

619
00:34:20.398 --> 00:34:24.103
(tenuous music)

620
00:34:33.675 --> 00:34:35.345
You tried to kill me!

621
00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.447
Don't pity yourself too much.
You look fine...

622
00:34:38.482 --> 00:34:40.680
Whatever you did to chase them
off worked.

623
00:34:40.715 --> 00:34:42.550
I didn't do anything!

624
00:34:42.585 --> 00:34:46.158
Something kept them away...

625
00:34:50.296 --> 00:34:51.889
(light humming)

626
00:34:51.924 --> 00:34:53.759
The light!

627
00:34:53.794 --> 00:34:54.694
What?

628
00:34:54.729 --> 00:34:57.664
Maybe they're afraid of it.

629
00:34:59.338 --> 00:35:02.273
We have only seen them at night.

630
00:35:02.308 --> 00:35:04.737
Maybe the light hurts them.

631
00:35:04.772 --> 00:35:06.541
Burns them.

632
00:35:06.576 --> 00:35:08.510
Do you think it's just the
lantern?

633
00:35:08.545 --> 00:35:09.940
I don't know.

634
00:35:09.975 --> 00:35:14.318
But it's not gonna last
forever...

635
00:35:14.815 --> 00:35:19.686
(rising music)

636
00:35:29.368 --> 00:35:31.929
As long as there are people on
this island

637
00:35:31.964 --> 00:35:36.208
there will be a fire...

638
00:36:16.745 --> 00:36:18.910
Are we sure this will work?

639
00:36:18.945 --> 00:36:21.286
Will fire really keep them away?

640
00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:22.617
I don't know.

641
00:36:22.652 --> 00:36:24.619
When will we know!?

642
00:36:24.654 --> 00:36:28.656
When the Hunters come and eat us
or not!

643
00:36:29.494 --> 00:36:32.297
We should get some rest.

644
00:36:32.332 --> 00:36:34.596
I can't sleep like this.

645
00:36:34.631 --> 00:36:37.434
Me neither.

646
00:36:39.064 --> 00:36:44.903
(haunting ocarina music)

647
00:37:02.791 --> 00:37:05.792
Where's Lex?

648
00:37:05.827 --> 00:37:07.926
Who cares.

649
00:37:07.961 --> 00:37:10.434
We're almost out of wood.

650
00:37:12.768 --> 00:37:15.340
Who's coming with?

651
00:37:15.375 --> 00:37:18.277
I can't go back out there.

652
00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:26.318
(anxious music)

653
00:37:45.867 --> 00:37:49.935
(ominous music)

654
00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.850
(Hunters calling in distance)

655
00:38:10.089 --> 00:38:15.565
(Hunters sniffing, calling
nearby)

656
00:38:16.469 --> 00:38:20.570
(more Hunters gathering)

657
00:38:25.137 --> 00:38:33.137
(Hunter nearby)

658
00:38:36.489 --> 00:38:37.653
(twig snaps)

659
00:38:37.688 --> 00:38:40.359
(Hunter roars)

660
00:38:45.729 --> 00:38:49.093
(Hunter approaches)

661
00:38:50.635 --> 00:38:53.900
(new Hunter roars)

662
00:38:55.167 --> 00:38:58.608
(Hunter roars)

663
00:38:58.643 --> 00:39:00.610
(electric pulse)

664
00:39:00.645 --> 00:39:04.515
(Hunters scream and flee)

665
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.584
Guess you were right about the
light.

666
00:39:08.686 --> 00:39:11.786
(Hunters roar in distance)

667
00:39:15.121 --> 00:39:16.923
(Hunter attacks)

668
00:39:16.958 --> 00:39:18.958
(electric blast)

669
00:39:31.577 --> 00:39:33.775
What? What happened?!

670
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.811
We found something!

671
00:39:41.917 --> 00:39:44.918
I've never seen one before
but...

672
00:39:44.953 --> 00:39:46.623
I think it's a Storm runner!

673
00:39:46.658 --> 00:39:48.053
Can't be! That would mean it's

674
00:39:48.088 --> 00:39:51.221
Over two hundred years old...

675
00:39:51.256 --> 00:39:55.126
(mysterious music)

676
00:39:58.637 --> 00:40:01.539
Where's the rest of it?

677
00:40:07.041 --> 00:40:08.810
It's still intact!

678
00:40:08.845 --> 00:40:09.778
What is?

679
00:40:09.813 --> 00:40:13.045
The computer core, it's still
functional!

680
00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:17.148
But the control element's gone.

681
00:40:17.183 --> 00:40:18.985
Without that it's useless.

682
00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.987
Just needs a jump-start huh?

683
00:40:21.022 --> 00:40:22.989
This is a waste of our time,
Tyl.

684
00:40:23.024 --> 00:40:25.761
I didn't bring you here for
nostalgia.

685
00:40:25.796 --> 00:40:28.533
I need help carrying something.

686
00:40:28.568 --> 00:40:30.535
What are we supposed to do with
this junk?!

687
00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.537
Look how old it is!

688
00:40:32.572 --> 00:40:34.869
That's not junk you're looking
at.

689
00:40:34.904 --> 00:40:37.641
There's a Trans-Conduit relay in
there.

690
00:40:37.676 --> 00:40:38.939
You sure?

691
00:40:38.974 --> 00:40:42.646
Checked it myself. Still works.

692
00:40:42.681 --> 00:40:44.714
I know what you're thinking.

693
00:40:44.749 --> 00:40:47.651
But if we screw this up
it could ruin the telescope.

694
00:40:47.686 --> 00:40:50.819
Isn't it worth the risk?

695
00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:01.665
(mysterious music)

696
00:41:04.065 --> 00:41:08.573
This was a Hyperion ship...

697
00:41:09.108 --> 00:41:11.774
If the Hyperions couldn't
survive here

698
00:41:11.809 --> 00:41:15.745
how are we supposed to?

699
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:20.145
(lonely music)

700
00:41:24.921 --> 00:41:27.658
A Trans-Conduit relay lets any
computer

701
00:41:27.693 --> 00:41:30.694
connect to the network
that links every system.

702
00:41:30.729 --> 00:41:32.696
If we hook it to the scope

703
00:41:32.731 --> 00:41:36.095
we might be able to
send a message back to Earth.

704
00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:37.195
Let me do it.

705
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.702
It's not that simple.

706
00:41:38.737 --> 00:41:39.934
Overload the conductor and

707
00:41:39.969 --> 00:41:41.936
the whole thing's cooked!

708
00:41:41.971 --> 00:41:43.333
That's why I'm doing it...

709
00:41:43.368 --> 00:41:45.203
How long will it take to contact
home?

710
00:41:45.238 --> 00:41:48.338
It's not as easy as calling mom
and dad...

711
00:41:48.373 --> 00:41:50.076
Connecting with Terra-Net only
lets us

712
00:41:50.111 --> 00:41:53.277
transmit messages to individual
addresses.

713
00:41:53.312 --> 00:41:56.247
If a message actually makes
it...

714
00:41:56.282 --> 00:41:58.249
They'll have to record their own
reply

715
00:41:58.284 --> 00:42:01.626
and hope it finds its way
back to the scope.

716
00:42:01.661 --> 00:42:03.089
Which it won't.

717
00:42:03.124 --> 00:42:04.354
If someone responds

718
00:42:04.389 --> 00:42:06.895
we can triangulate our position

719
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.194
and have them send help.

720
00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:12.901
Here we go...

721
00:42:12.936 --> 00:42:14.771
(computer beeps in error)

722
00:42:14.806 --> 00:42:15.673
Did you break it?

723
00:42:15.708 --> 00:42:16.839
Can we fix it?

724
00:42:16.874 --> 00:42:18.368
It's fine, I just need my
splicer.

725
00:42:18.403 --> 00:42:19.369
Where is it?

726
00:42:19.404 --> 00:42:20.645
My pack, I'll get it.

727
00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.307
No you keep working on it.
Howard?

728
00:42:39.094 --> 00:42:42.766
(tenuous music)

729
00:42:56.749 --> 00:42:58.078
What are you doing with that?!

730
00:42:58.113 --> 00:43:00.344
Shut your goddamn mouth!

731
00:43:00.379 --> 00:43:01.312
What's the matter?

732
00:43:01.347 --> 00:43:03.215
Day 1: Assessed Slip Gate.

733
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.184
Unable to establish return
portal

734
00:43:05.219 --> 00:43:07.725
for more than three seconds.

735
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.727
Replaced coupler. No
improvement.

736
00:43:09.762 --> 00:43:12.224
Day 8: Gemini telescope battery

737
00:43:12.259 --> 00:43:14.798
unable to jump-start Gate.

738
00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:17.702
Day 20: Energy source to power
Gate

739
00:43:17.737 --> 00:43:19.297
needs to be larger.

740
00:43:19.332 --> 00:43:20.903
Day 30: Found crashed ship.

741
00:43:20.938 --> 00:43:22.806
Should be able to salvage parts

742
00:43:22.841 --> 00:43:24.038
to stabilize Gate.

743
00:43:24.073 --> 00:43:25.402
He has been sneaking off

744
00:43:25.437 --> 00:43:28.977
and working on the Slip Gate all
this time!

745
00:43:29.848 --> 00:43:31.947
Can you fix it?

746
00:43:32.279 --> 00:43:33.982
No.

747
00:43:34.017 --> 00:43:35.984
We don't have the parts.

748
00:43:36.019 --> 00:43:36.985
Why didn't you tell us?

749
00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.087
Because he didn't
want to bring us with him!

750
00:43:40.122 --> 00:43:42.386
He was going to leave us here

751
00:43:42.421 --> 00:43:44.828
so that he can go home
and win the games on his own.

752
00:43:44.863 --> 00:43:46.830
I would have sent help when I
got back!

753
00:43:46.865 --> 00:43:49.129
You've been lying to us this
whole time!

754
00:43:49.164 --> 00:43:51.131
How do you know so much
about Slip Gates, Lex?

755
00:43:51.166 --> 00:43:52.968
Nobody's allowed to learn how
they work-

756
00:43:53.003 --> 00:43:54.937
You did this, didn't you?

757
00:43:54.972 --> 00:43:56.939
Didn't you!?

758
00:43:56.974 --> 00:43:59.711
You sabotaged the Slip Gate
network...

759
00:43:59.746 --> 00:44:01.174
You rigged it so we'd be stuck

760
00:44:01.209 --> 00:44:03.440
on this backwater planet
with no chance of winning.

761
00:44:03.475 --> 00:44:05.981
But you did too good of a job.

762
00:44:06.016 --> 00:44:07.785
Your team crashed the network so
bad

763
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.413
that it sucked everyone in.

764
00:44:09.448 --> 00:44:11.415
You fell into your own trap.

765
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:12.757
Is he right?

766
00:44:12.792 --> 00:44:13.923
Tell us!

767
00:44:13.958 --> 00:44:14.958
Why'd you do it!?

768
00:44:14.992 --> 00:44:17.927
Because I have to win!

769
00:44:20.228 --> 00:44:23.867
If I don't bring back that
Hyperion coin...

770
00:44:25.167 --> 00:44:27.299
You wouldn't understand.

771
00:44:27.334 --> 00:44:29.466
I had to do it!

772
00:44:29.501 --> 00:44:31.743
Everything that's happened...

773
00:44:31.778 --> 00:44:33.745
Everything!

774
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.944
It's all your fault.

775
00:44:34.979 --> 00:44:36.473
That night with the Hunters

776
00:44:36.508 --> 00:44:39.014
you tried killing me to hide the
journal.

777
00:44:39.049 --> 00:44:40.510
Instead I saved you!

778
00:44:40.545 --> 00:44:44.184
Where would we be if we didn't
learn what light can do?!

779
00:44:44.219 --> 00:44:45.757
And the rest?

780
00:44:45.792 --> 00:44:48.793
This is Sol Invictus.

781
00:44:48.828 --> 00:44:51.125
Winning's the only rule.

782
00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.457
They should have known
what they were getting in to.

783
00:44:53.492 --> 00:44:55.294
Wrap it however you want.

784
00:44:55.329 --> 00:44:58.198
If you hadn't done that, we'd be
home now!

785
00:44:58.233 --> 00:45:02.301
And innocent people would still
be alive.

786
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:06.503
I feel sorry for you.

787
00:45:17.417 --> 00:45:19.021
What are we gonna do with him?

788
00:45:19.056 --> 00:45:20.792
Can't trust him anymore.

789
00:45:20.827 --> 00:45:22.959
Before you do anything rash,

790
00:45:22.994 --> 00:45:24.895
afraid I need him over here.

791
00:45:25.997 --> 00:45:28.558
The relay's almost done.

792
00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:30.395
Go.

793
00:45:31.937 --> 00:45:35.367
(relay powers up)

794
00:45:36.106 --> 00:45:38.304
(relay processes)

795
00:45:38.339 --> 00:45:40.240
(error beeps)

796
00:45:40.275 --> 00:45:42.011
(power fades)

797
00:45:42.046 --> 00:45:44.882
(device boots up)

798
00:45:44.917 --> 00:45:47.984
(processing beeps)

799
00:45:50.021 --> 00:45:51.515
The signal's too weak.

800
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:53.088
That's as good as we're gonna
get.

801
00:45:53.123 --> 00:45:55.123
That won't get the messages
half way to Earth!

802
00:45:55.158 --> 00:45:58.192
Then we'll try anyway!

803
00:45:58.227 --> 00:46:01.899
(lonely music)

804
00:46:02.368 --> 00:46:06.266
This is Lex of Scorpius
to anyone at command.

805
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:08.906
Hi, Mom and Dad...

806
00:46:09.241 --> 00:46:12.239
By now you've probably heard
from school.

807
00:46:12.274 --> 00:46:15.143
We've no idea where we are.

808
00:46:15.178 --> 00:46:17.145
Nobody does.

809
00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.147
My assignment

810
00:46:19.182 --> 00:46:22.513
did more than we could have
imagined.

811
00:46:22.548 --> 00:46:25.318
Trapping me on the same

812
00:46:25.353 --> 00:46:28.288
unknown planet as the rest of
them.

813
00:46:28.323 --> 00:46:31.093
Why did I come out here?

814
00:46:31.595 --> 00:46:34.228
Was I wrong about all this?

815
00:46:34.263 --> 00:46:36.593
Everything I did,

816
00:46:36.628 --> 00:46:39.332
I did for the mission.

817
00:46:45.538 --> 00:46:52.048
(introspective music swells)

818
00:46:54.646 --> 00:46:58.483
(thunderstorm in distance)

819
00:47:46.973 --> 00:47:51.635
(hopeful music)

820
00:47:52.407 --> 00:47:55.210
Please respond.

821
00:47:55.245 --> 00:47:57.707
Please...

822
00:47:57.742 --> 00:48:00.380
Say anything.

823
00:48:00.415 --> 00:48:03.152
I'll win.

824
00:48:03.587 --> 00:48:05.649
One way or the other.

825
00:48:05.684 --> 00:48:08.025
I can't wait to get home.

826
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.456
I love you guys.

827
00:48:10.491 --> 00:48:12.491
See you soon.

828
00:48:13.329 --> 00:48:16.231
Say anything...

829
00:48:16.266 --> 00:48:19.234
I just want to hear from you.

830
00:48:32.084 --> 00:48:34.612
(telescope relay boots)

831
00:48:34.647 --> 00:48:36.647
Let's send these things!

832
00:48:37.617 --> 00:48:39.991
Enter the address here.

833
00:48:49.035 --> 00:48:51.134
This is it!

834
00:48:51.169 --> 00:48:55.534
(computer processing)

835
00:49:00.607 --> 00:49:01.540
That's it?

836
00:49:01.575 --> 00:49:04.510
What were you expecting,
an instant response?

837
00:49:04.545 --> 00:49:06.512
It could take hours
for them to reach everyone.

838
00:49:06.547 --> 00:49:07.480
Then leave it on all night.

839
00:49:07.515 --> 00:49:10.714
I want to know the instant we
get a reply!

840
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.724
(lonely music)

841
00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.597
I wonder what it looks like from
up there.

842
00:49:26.666 --> 00:49:30.206
From all those other fires.

843
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:49.291
Want to check yours?

844
00:49:52.494 --> 00:49:54.263
That's enough.

845
00:49:54.298 --> 00:49:55.693
Time to turn it off.

846
00:49:55.728 --> 00:49:56.793
Wait!

847
00:49:56.828 --> 00:49:58.729
I want to know when they hear
from me.

848
00:49:58.764 --> 00:50:01.105
If we leave it on any longer
we'll kill the battery.

849
00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.041
No!

850
00:50:03.276 --> 00:50:05.472
Wait! I want to hear back!

851
00:50:05.507 --> 00:50:07.243
Turn it off or we're really
screwed!

852
00:50:07.278 --> 00:50:08.409
Give it to me!

853
00:50:08.444 --> 00:50:10.444
Let it go!

854
00:50:20.654 --> 00:50:22.225
Give it to me.

855
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.656
So you're gonna shoot me now!?

856
00:50:25.725 --> 00:50:27.428
Give me the gun, Kit!

857
00:50:27.463 --> 00:50:28.561
No!

858
00:50:28.596 --> 00:50:30.233
Kit, give me the gun!

859
00:50:30.268 --> 00:50:31.696
Kit!

860
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:33.599
Give me the gun!

861
00:50:33.634 --> 00:50:35.601
No!

862
00:50:35.636 --> 00:50:37.636
(arrow shoots)

863
00:50:49.683 --> 00:50:52.123
(gasping)

864
00:50:52.158 --> 00:50:53.388
What'd you do!?

865
00:50:53.423 --> 00:50:54.686
It was an accident!

866
00:50:54.721 --> 00:50:56.589
I- I didn't...

867
00:50:56.624 --> 00:50:58.624
What have you done?!

868
00:50:59.259 --> 00:51:02.397
Eli, please just hold still.

869
00:51:02.432 --> 00:51:04.366
Just give me a second!

870
00:51:04.401 --> 00:51:06.467
Eli!

871
00:51:06.502 --> 00:51:09.569
(gasping, sounds fade away)

872
00:51:09.604 --> 00:51:12.869
(failing heartbeat)

873
00:51:25.884 --> 00:51:30.722
(sorrowful music)

874
00:52:11.732 --> 00:52:16.636
(forlorn ocarina music)

875
00:52:26.846 --> 00:52:28.384
Of course it was his fault!

876
00:52:28.419 --> 00:52:30.386
Okay! You're right. But...

877
00:52:30.421 --> 00:52:31.750
He didn't mean to-

878
00:52:31.785 --> 00:52:34.786
He feels even worse about it
than you do.

879
00:52:35.121 --> 00:52:38.691
You can't make him sleep outside
forever.

880
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:52.606
You got us into this mess,

881
00:52:52.641 --> 00:52:54.971
it's your job to get us out.

882
00:52:55.974 --> 00:52:58.348
You're in charge now.

883
00:52:58.383 --> 00:53:02.220
(tense music)

884
00:53:03.586 --> 00:53:06.653
Time to stop waiting.

885
00:53:06.688 --> 00:53:10.019
(telescope boots)

886
00:53:10.054 --> 00:53:12.989
(processing beeps)

887
00:53:19.932 --> 00:53:21.998
(energetic beeping)

888
00:53:22.033 --> 00:53:24.000
No way...

889
00:53:24.035 --> 00:53:29.643
(energetic beeping)

890
00:53:29.678 --> 00:53:31.381
Message received?

891
00:53:31.416 --> 00:53:32.778
Message received?!

892
00:53:32.813 --> 00:53:34.780
Message received!

893
00:53:34.815 --> 00:53:36.584
We got one! We got a reply!

894
00:53:36.619 --> 00:53:37.717
Somebody sent a response!

895
00:53:37.752 --> 00:53:40.049
Somebody heard from us!?

896
00:53:40.084 --> 00:53:42.018
(whistles)

897
00:53:43.362 --> 00:53:45.626
Tyl, somebody sent a reply!

898
00:53:45.661 --> 00:53:47.892
(processing beeps)

899
00:53:47.927 --> 00:53:49.564
Eli VO: Hi, Mom and Dad.

900
00:53:49.599 --> 00:53:50.895
We haven't received a response.

901
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:53.304
It's one of our own messages
bounced back to us.

902
00:53:53.539 --> 00:53:55.537
It didn't even make it out of
the system.

903
00:53:55.572 --> 00:53:57.539
(Eli's message plays in
background)

904
00:53:57.574 --> 00:53:59.310
No one received any messages.

905
00:53:59.345 --> 00:54:01.345
No one ever will!

906
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.941
I can't believe we thought
this thing would work.

907
00:54:03.976 --> 00:54:05.943
(telescope shuts off)

908
00:54:05.978 --> 00:54:07.714
Wait a second!

909
00:54:07.749 --> 00:54:09.716
Just one of the messages bounced
back.

910
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:11.685
Others could still make it
through!

911
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.820
But if you break the telescope
we'll never know!

912
00:54:14.855 --> 00:54:16.822
To think I let you

913
00:54:16.857 --> 00:54:19.462
get my hopes up, Hal.

914
00:54:19.497 --> 00:54:21.464
You couldn't even check the
message.

915
00:54:21.499 --> 00:54:25.369
You just started dancing
around like a fat fool!

916
00:54:25.738 --> 00:54:27.767
You broke my gun.

917
00:54:27.802 --> 00:54:30.770
We lost our food because of you!

918
00:54:30.805 --> 00:54:33.069
How could anybody be so stupid

919
00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:35.071
and yet still be alive?!

920
00:54:35.106 --> 00:54:36.776
You've gotta be the most hapless
oaf

921
00:54:36.811 --> 00:54:38.745
I've ever seen in my life!

922
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:41.781
(angry yelling)

923
00:54:42.883 --> 00:54:45.521
Stop it! Hal, stop!

924
00:54:45.556 --> 00:54:48.887
(grunting and yelling)

925
00:54:48.922 --> 00:54:52.088
(angry yelling)

926
00:54:52.423 --> 00:54:55.498
I shouldn't be here.

927
00:54:55.533 --> 00:54:57.830
I want to go home.

928
00:54:57.865 --> 00:54:59.601
(lonely music)

929
00:54:59.636 --> 00:55:01.603
I want to go home!

930
00:55:01.638 --> 00:55:03.066
(crying)

931
00:55:03.101 --> 00:55:07.378
None of this was supposed to
happen...

932
00:55:07.413 --> 00:55:10.513
What was I thinking?

933
00:55:11.945 --> 00:55:14.781
(sniffling)

934
00:55:14.816 --> 00:55:18.521
(crying)

935
00:55:30.568 --> 00:55:32.062
We can't build a boat!

936
00:55:32.097 --> 00:55:34.702
Haven't you seen what's
out there? We'd never make it!

937
00:55:34.737 --> 00:55:35.670
We're trapped!

938
00:55:35.705 --> 00:55:36.738
It's our only option.

939
00:55:36.773 --> 00:55:39.608
Would you rather die here
or trying to find help?!

940
00:55:39.643 --> 00:55:41.775
There's no one out there to help
us!

941
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:43.777
It's up to us to make it back!

942
00:55:43.812 --> 00:55:45.779
You put me in charge, remember?

943
00:55:45.814 --> 00:55:47.649
Or do you think you can do
better?

944
00:55:47.684 --> 00:55:49.882
Tyl might listen to you, but I'm
not.

945
00:55:49.917 --> 00:55:52.522
I'm not going out there!
I'm not making a boat!

946
00:55:52.557 --> 00:55:53.952
Then you can live on your own.

947
00:55:53.987 --> 00:55:57.725
If you're not working
I'm kicking you out of my camp!

948
00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.595
This wouldn't be such a problem

949
00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:01.597
if you hadn't murdered our only
Astronomer!

950
00:56:01.632 --> 00:56:03.599
(angry yells)

951
00:56:03.634 --> 00:56:05.964
Hey!

952
00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:15.006
You look like shit.

953
00:56:15.712 --> 00:56:18.075
What's going on?

954
00:56:18.343 --> 00:56:21.144
(thunderstorm outside)

955
00:56:21.179 --> 00:56:23.652
Here that long, huh?

956
00:56:24.354 --> 00:56:27.557
Any more ideas how we got here?

957
00:56:30.694 --> 00:56:32.463
No.

958
00:56:32.498 --> 00:56:34.465
There is

959
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.731
one other option.

960
00:56:36.999 --> 00:56:38.931
Every year the Board of
Governors

961
00:56:38.966 --> 00:56:42.033
sends out a judge in each team
to observe.

962
00:56:42.368 --> 00:56:44.640
No one ever knows about it.

963
00:56:44.675 --> 00:56:47.170
The judges pick a contestant
from every team,

964
00:56:47.205 --> 00:56:49.205
make sure they can trust him,

965
00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:53.011
and assign him to report back on
the games.

966
00:56:53.046 --> 00:56:56.718
Sometimes I bet they even rig
it.

967
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:02.790
How'd you find this out?

968
00:57:02.825 --> 00:57:05.595
I talked it out of someone last
year.

969
00:57:06.928 --> 00:57:08.059
Now.

970
00:57:08.094 --> 00:57:10.930
No one can come home till
someone's won.

971
00:57:11.165 --> 00:57:13.504
These judges do it all the time.

972
00:57:13.539 --> 00:57:16.606
Pop home to report then slip
right back.

973
00:57:16.641 --> 00:57:18.608
Say they'd gone to
the bathroom or something.

974
00:57:18.643 --> 00:57:21.138
I know how to contact the Gate
Ops.

975
00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:23.877
Tell 'em you're a student judge,

976
00:57:23.912 --> 00:57:25.648
and they'll bring you home.

977
00:57:25.683 --> 00:57:27.650
If you were right

978
00:57:27.685 --> 00:57:29.652
I would have heard about it.

979
00:57:29.687 --> 00:57:31.786
How can we believe you?

980
00:57:31.821 --> 00:57:34.019
Because Shrimp,

981
00:57:34.588 --> 00:57:37.528
that's how I got home first.

982
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:40.597
That's how I cheated.

983
00:57:40.632 --> 00:57:42.225
I told the Slip Gate Operators

984
00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:43.534
that I was a judge.

985
00:57:43.569 --> 00:57:45.800
When I came out I raised my
scope

986
00:57:45.835 --> 00:57:48.033
and said I'd found Sol.

987
00:57:48.635 --> 00:57:51.135
The Gate Ops don't talk but

988
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:53.269
the judges figured it out.

989
00:57:53.304 --> 00:57:56.140
There's no way to contact home
or I'd have done it.

990
00:57:56.175 --> 00:57:57.812
There's one.

991
00:57:57.847 --> 00:58:01.651
That Hyperion ship
still has a working core.

992
00:58:01.686 --> 00:58:04.115
Your scope is programmed for the
Gate Ops.

993
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:05.820
If you run it through the ship

994
00:58:05.855 --> 00:58:07.184
it'll let you call for a
pick-up.

995
00:58:07.219 --> 00:58:08.889
No.

996
00:58:09.826 --> 00:58:11.826
The control element's missing.

997
00:58:11.861 --> 00:58:14.092
We'd never find it out here.

998
00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:20.065
You knew a way home

999
00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.803
and you didn't tell us?

1000
00:58:21.838 --> 00:58:23.640
What were you waiting for?!

1001
00:58:23.675 --> 00:58:25.741
When they realize we cheated
they'll come after us

1002
00:58:25.776 --> 00:58:27.743
with everything they have.

1003
00:58:27.778 --> 00:58:30.141
We'd be better off staying here.

1004
00:58:30.376 --> 00:58:32.242
You made it back...

1005
00:58:32.277 --> 00:58:33.914
It took

1006
00:58:33.949 --> 00:58:37.720
everything my family had to get
me back in.

1007
00:58:39.691 --> 00:58:41.658
I'd never do it again either.

1008
00:58:41.693 --> 00:58:43.957
If not for all this.

1009
00:58:43.992 --> 00:58:46.223
But look at all that's happened.

1010
00:58:46.491 --> 00:58:48.632
Wouldn't they understand?

1011
00:58:48.667 --> 00:58:50.095
Believe me,

1012
00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:52.603
they won't care.

1013
00:58:52.905 --> 00:58:55.001
If you try and explain
beforehand

1014
00:58:55.036 --> 00:58:56.640
you'll just blow your cover.

1015
00:58:56.675 --> 00:58:58.268
Is it really that bad?

1016
00:58:58.303 --> 00:59:00.270
When you stand before them

1017
00:59:00.305 --> 00:59:03.746
and see your entire future
slipping away.

1018
00:59:05.112 --> 00:59:07.376
Remember how you felt today.

1019
00:59:07.411 --> 00:59:09.378
Cause whoever gives them their
name

1020
00:59:09.413 --> 00:59:12.590
that's the one they'll come
after worst.

1021
00:59:13.021 --> 00:59:15.153
He's done.

1022
00:59:16.024 --> 00:59:17.694
We'll do it.

1023
00:59:17.729 --> 00:59:19.355
No.

1024
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:21.027
No we won't.

1025
00:59:21.062 --> 00:59:23.029
I'm in charge now remember?

1026
00:59:23.064 --> 00:59:25.636
I just want to go home.

1027
00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:26.901
More than anything.

1028
00:59:26.936 --> 00:59:28.199
I'm sorry. I am.

1029
00:59:28.234 --> 00:59:30.168
I want to go home too
but there's another way

1030
00:59:30.203 --> 00:59:32.203
off this planet and I'm gonna
find it.

1031
00:59:32.238 --> 00:59:36.042
You can't have the scope. I'm
sorry.

1032
00:59:36.913 --> 00:59:37.978
Wait, Lex-

1033
00:59:38.013 --> 00:59:39.683
No!

1034
00:59:58.264 --> 01:00:02.266
(nervous breathing)

1035
01:00:05.238 --> 01:00:08.877
(anxious music)

1036
01:00:16.348 --> 01:00:18.315
Where's the scope?!

1037
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.415
It's gone!

1038
01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:21.252
Could he have gone to look for
Sol?

1039
01:00:21.287 --> 01:00:22.385
We gotta find him!

1040
01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.255
He could be anywhere by now. How
can we-

1041
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:26.257
Quiet!

1042
01:00:26.292 --> 01:00:28.798
Listen.

1043
01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:31.328
(footsteps heard through camera)

1044
01:00:31.697 --> 01:00:34.870
Your camera's still connected to
it.

1045
01:00:36.874 --> 01:00:39.171
I see something.

1046
01:00:39.877 --> 01:00:41.844
Hal? Hal?

1047
01:00:41.879 --> 01:00:44.044
Hal, what's going on!?

1048
01:00:45.949 --> 01:00:47.212
I'm taking the scope.

1049
01:00:47.247 --> 01:00:49.082
I won't let your ruin this. I'm
going home!

1050
01:00:49.117 --> 01:00:51.381
But we need the scope.
You can't just take it!

1051
01:00:51.416 --> 01:00:53.383
You know we'll never find Sol!

1052
01:00:53.418 --> 01:00:56.254
But at least if I call home
we can finally leave.

1053
01:00:56.289 --> 01:00:59.422
What about us?
Somebody has to take the fall!

1054
01:00:59.457 --> 01:01:01.160
Don't we get a say in it?!

1055
01:01:01.195 --> 01:01:02.359
I'm sorry,

1056
01:01:02.394 --> 01:01:04.834
but I don't care about the
tournament.

1057
01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:06.165
I can live with the
consequences,

1058
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.365
my family needs me home.

1059
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.773
You wouldn't understand.

1060
01:01:09.808 --> 01:01:10.852
It's easy for you to talk big

1061
01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:13.040
when you're the one
running with our telescope!

1062
01:01:13.075 --> 01:01:14.305
What would you know?

1063
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.472
I'm doing it to help someone.

1064
01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:17.979
You guys have never thought

1065
01:01:18.014 --> 01:01:20.014
about anybody but yourselves!

1066
01:01:20.412 --> 01:01:21.818
No...

1067
01:01:21.853 --> 01:01:25.481
(Hunters calling nearby)

1068
01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:27.252
Hal! Do you have a light?

1069
01:01:27.287 --> 01:01:29.518
You need to get back to camp.
Hurry!

1070
01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:31.355
I think I hear something.

1071
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:33.258
Where are you, Hal?

1072
01:01:33.293 --> 01:01:34.930
I'm in the forest.

1073
01:01:34.965 --> 01:01:36.767
That's their forest.
That's where they live!

1074
01:01:36.802 --> 01:01:39.198
Listen! Hide.
We're coming for you right now.

1075
01:01:39.233 --> 01:01:41.332
(Hunter roars)

1076
01:01:41.367 --> 01:01:42.872
Hal, run!

1077
01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:45.138
(roars and screams)

1078
01:01:45.173 --> 01:01:48.944
(Hunters roaring and feeding)

1079
01:01:51.443 --> 01:01:54.246
(static)

1080
01:01:54.281 --> 01:01:57.821
(tragic music)

1081
01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:03.090
You had your chance!

1082
01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:05.323
You don't know what you're
doing!

1083
01:02:05.358 --> 01:02:07.930
Why should we trust you now?

1084
01:02:09.494 --> 01:02:12.099
Because I know what to do.

1085
01:02:14.169 --> 01:02:16.400
I'm getting us home.

1086
01:02:17.106 --> 01:02:19.106
It's Tyl's team.

1087
01:02:19.141 --> 01:02:21.471
I'm with him.

1088
01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:39.390
If I do this,

1089
01:02:39.425 --> 01:02:43.064
do you promise you'll get us
home?

1090
01:02:46.498 --> 01:02:49.367
I promise.

1091
01:02:59.214 --> 01:03:01.951
It's not safe to split up.

1092
01:03:01.986 --> 01:03:04.349
We'll just have to comb the
whole forest.

1093
01:03:04.384 --> 01:03:06.549
(sounds of movement in brush)

1094
01:03:06.584 --> 01:03:08.584
(birds take flight)

1095
01:03:10.456 --> 01:03:13.325
No point delaying the
inevitable.

1096
01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.867
(eerie music)

1097
01:03:41.388 --> 01:03:44.257
It's quiet here.

1098
01:03:44.292 --> 01:03:46.897
I don't like it.

1099
01:03:57.041 --> 01:04:00.207
(tense music)

1100
01:04:00.242 --> 01:04:02.572
There it is.

1101
01:04:04.213 --> 01:04:06.917
Let's make a break for it.

1102
01:04:06.952 --> 01:04:08.314
Wait.

1103
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:11.317
Whatever did this could still be
here.

1104
01:04:11.352 --> 01:04:14.221
(tense music)

1105
01:04:38.478 --> 01:04:40.918
(yells)

1106
01:04:56.199 --> 01:04:57.968
The telescope!

1107
01:04:58.003 --> 01:04:59.200
Is it okay?!

1108
01:04:59.235 --> 01:05:00.399
It's fine!

1109
01:05:00.434 --> 01:05:02.434
But look...

1110
01:05:08.211 --> 01:05:11.476
(mysterious music)

1111
01:05:11.511 --> 01:05:13.313
I think-

1112
01:05:13.348 --> 01:05:16.349
I think they took Hal down
there.

1113
01:05:18.683 --> 01:05:20.254
Can you see anything?

1114
01:05:20.289 --> 01:05:22.091
There are tunnels inside.

1115
01:05:22.126 --> 01:05:23.752
Long ones...

1116
01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:26.359
I can't see the ends.

1117
01:05:26.994 --> 01:05:30.330
It must be where they go during
the day.

1118
01:05:30.365 --> 01:05:32.761
There could be a whole world
down there.

1119
01:05:32.796 --> 01:05:35.434
Even bigger than the island.

1120
01:05:36.635 --> 01:05:40.340
Then let's keep it down there.

1121
01:05:40.375 --> 01:05:42.375
(fire crackles loudly)

1122
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:48.645
This is the only way out.

1123
01:05:49.747 --> 01:05:52.088
Are you sure?

1124
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:55.190
Unless those things can fly.

1125
01:05:59.328 --> 01:06:02.065
Do you think it'll be able to
stop 'em?

1126
01:06:03.563 --> 01:06:06.168
I don't know.

1127
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:09.402
(Hunters calling in forest)

1128
01:06:12.572 --> 01:06:15.375
(Hunters roar)

1129
01:06:16.246 --> 01:06:18.774
(exciting music)

1130
01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:21.315
Stop! Listen!

1131
01:06:22.252 --> 01:06:24.516
They're not coming!

1132
01:06:24.551 --> 01:06:29.323
(Hunters roar angrily in
background)

1133
01:06:30.623 --> 01:06:33.129
It worked.

1134
01:06:33.164 --> 01:06:35.098
It works!

1135
01:06:35.633 --> 01:06:38.200
Are we sure it'll last all
night?

1136
01:06:38.532 --> 01:06:40.466
I hope.

1137
01:06:40.501 --> 01:06:42.468
We'll have to keep the fire
going.

1138
01:06:42.503 --> 01:06:43.799
I'll take tomorrow.

1139
01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:46.241
Then Lex. Then you, Kit.

1140
01:06:46.276 --> 01:06:48.441
We'll keep them trapped forever.

1141
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.807
I wonder if they'll start to eat
each other

1142
01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:54.282
when they realize they're never
leaving.

1143
01:06:54.317 --> 01:06:57.153
(Hunters continue to roar
angrily)

1144
01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:08.230
(lone roar)

1145
01:07:12.401 --> 01:07:15.534
Are you sure you're ready?

1146
01:07:18.572 --> 01:07:21.276
Then let's go home.

1147
01:07:24.149 --> 01:07:28.184
(hopeful music)

1148
01:07:45.599 --> 01:07:47.632
The core's still intact.

1149
01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:49.766
All we need is the control
element.

1150
01:07:49.801 --> 01:07:51.372
No.

1151
01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.539
Not like this.

1152
01:07:53.574 --> 01:07:55.145
I can't go home like that.

1153
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:57.609
It's time to go home!

1154
01:07:59.811 --> 01:08:01.811
(camera beeps)

1155
01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:19.697
(ship powers up)

1156
01:08:19.732 --> 01:08:22.271
(ship fails, powers down)

1157
01:08:22.306 --> 01:08:23.734
Tyl, that's not gonna work.

1158
01:08:23.769 --> 01:08:25.439
Main power's offline.

1159
01:08:26.706 --> 01:08:28.805
Then what can we do?

1160
01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.708
I can do it.

1161
01:08:30.743 --> 01:08:31.709
Let me try.

1162
01:08:31.744 --> 01:08:33.315
One wrong wire

1163
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:35.317
and he could fry the whole
computer.

1164
01:08:35.352 --> 01:08:38.749
If he ever wanted to
screw us over it would be now.

1165
01:08:39.554 --> 01:08:41.488
Can you get it to work?

1166
01:08:41.523 --> 01:08:42.322
No!

1167
01:08:42.357 --> 01:08:44.722
I'm sorry but how can we trust
him?

1168
01:08:44.757 --> 01:08:46.757
Because.

1169
01:08:47.661 --> 01:08:49.925
He's better than that.

1170
01:08:50.796 --> 01:08:53.401
Fix it.

1171
01:09:01.774 --> 01:09:05.215
(ship powers up)

1172
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:11.254
(ship echoes with power)

1173
01:09:11.289 --> 01:09:15.621
(noise evens out)

1174
01:09:23.961 --> 01:09:27.237
(relay powers up)

1175
01:09:27.272 --> 01:09:31.736
(electronic communications
sounds)

1176
01:09:31.771 --> 01:09:34.277
(voice emerges from static)

1177
01:09:34.312 --> 01:09:36.840
Slip Gate Operator: Come in,
this is Slip Gate Control.

1178
01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:37.774
Hello?

1179
01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:39.843
Gate Op: Who's this? Identify
yourself.

1180
01:09:39.878 --> 01:09:41.845
I'm a student judge in the
Sol Invictus games.

1181
01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.847
Requesting immediate transit
back to Earth

1182
01:09:43.882 --> 01:09:44.781
for a report.

1183
01:09:44.817 --> 01:09:47.818
Gate Op: Sol Invictus? That was
weeks ago.

1184
01:09:47.853 --> 01:09:49.556
We thought you were all dead.

1185
01:09:49.591 --> 01:09:50.887
We're not.

1186
01:09:50.922 --> 01:09:51.855
Not yet.

1187
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:53.021
Gate Op: I don't believe it.

1188
01:09:53.056 --> 01:09:54.759
We need to get you back for
debrief.

1189
01:09:54.794 --> 01:09:55.727
What's your name?

1190
01:09:55.762 --> 01:09:56.695
My name?

1191
01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:58.598
Gate Op: Every portal needs
a record on file

1192
01:09:58.633 --> 01:10:02.338
for who authorized it.
Especially student judges.

1193
01:10:02.373 --> 01:10:05.407
Give me your name.

1194
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:08.740
Kit. Kit of Capricorn.

1195
01:10:08.775 --> 01:10:10.841
I take full responsibility.

1196
01:10:10.876 --> 01:10:13.349
I need a portal back to Earth
immediately.

1197
01:10:13.384 --> 01:10:14.746
The Gate here was damaged.

1198
01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:16.319
I can't get a portal up.

1199
01:10:16.354 --> 01:10:17.782
I need you to open one on your
end.

1200
01:10:17.817 --> 01:10:19.520
We can still activate one from
Earth.

1201
01:10:19.555 --> 01:10:21.456
All I need is your planet code.

1202
01:10:21.491 --> 01:10:23.557
Give it to me and we'll
have you home by nightfall.

1203
01:10:23.592 --> 01:10:24.756
Can't you tell me where I am?

1204
01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:26.329
We don't know where you landed.

1205
01:10:26.364 --> 01:10:27.759
Now we can open a portal

1206
01:10:27.794 --> 01:10:30.399
but only if we know which one to
use.

1207
01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:32.599
Without that there's
no way to get you home.

1208
01:10:32.634 --> 01:10:34.073
Then open all the Gates in the
system!

1209
01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:35.833
Do you have any idea how many
that is?

1210
01:10:35.868 --> 01:10:37.736
The resources that would waste?!

1211
01:10:37.771 --> 01:10:39.309
You know we can't do that.

1212
01:10:39.344 --> 01:10:40.937
What about a rescue party?

1213
01:10:40.972 --> 01:10:42.510
Can you send anyone?

1214
01:10:42.545 --> 01:10:43.478
We can't.

1215
01:10:43.513 --> 01:10:46.778
You could be in any corner of
the galaxy.

1216
01:10:46.813 --> 01:10:49.451
What are you saying?

1217
01:10:49.486 --> 01:10:51.453
You know what I'm saying.

1218
01:10:51.488 --> 01:10:52.960
If we don't know what planet
you're on,

1219
01:10:52.984 --> 01:10:55.424
there's nothing we can do.

1220
01:10:55.459 --> 01:10:57.855
I know this is hard to hear

1221
01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:59.923
but you're not coming home.

1222
01:10:59.958 --> 01:11:01.463
I'm sorry.

1223
01:11:01.498 --> 01:11:03.465
Gate Control out...

1224
01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.996
(static)

1225
01:11:09.066 --> 01:11:11.836
We got so close...

1226
01:11:12.138 --> 01:11:15.774
Now we're even further
than when we started.

1227
01:11:15.809 --> 01:11:18.480
How could this have happened to
us?

1228
01:11:18.682 --> 01:11:20.009
I'm sorry.

1229
01:11:21.716 --> 01:11:23.749
I'm really sorry.

1230
01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:26.081
We're never going home.

1231
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:29.755
What is home?

1232
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:31.790
This isn't.

1233
01:11:32.092 --> 01:11:34.331
It could never be.

1234
01:11:40.768 --> 01:11:42.834
The fire's almost out.

1235
01:11:42.869 --> 01:11:44.869
Maybe you should put some wood
on it.

1236
01:11:44.904 --> 01:11:46.904
What's the point?

1237
01:11:47.808 --> 01:11:48.741
Where are you going?

1238
01:11:48.776 --> 01:11:51.480
Does it even matter anymore?!

1239
01:11:55.915 --> 01:12:00.115
(thunder rolling in)

1240
01:12:03.725 --> 01:12:07.430
(rain sizzles on fire)

1241
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:19.376
(lonely music)

1242
01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.174
My name is Tyl of Libra.

1243
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:28.176
The date?

1244
01:12:28.211 --> 01:12:30.651
I don't even know.

1245
01:12:30.686 --> 01:12:32.785
If you found this telescope then
you're

1246
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:34.490
probably stranded here too.

1247
01:12:34.525 --> 01:12:36.085
If that's the case,

1248
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.429
then I'm sorry.

1249
01:12:39.959 --> 01:12:41.563
My only advice is-

1250
01:12:41.598 --> 01:12:45.468
(computer beeps frantically)

1251
01:12:45.503 --> 01:12:47.866
No...

1252
01:12:47.901 --> 01:12:50.473
(computer processing)

1253
01:12:50.508 --> 01:12:53.575
Message VO: Eli?
Eli, I just saw your message.

1254
01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:56.171
Where are you? What happened?

1255
01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:58.173
We're so worried.

1256
01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:00.208
Your father and I
have been trying to find you

1257
01:13:00.243 --> 01:13:02.452
and no one will tell us
anything.

1258
01:13:02.487 --> 01:13:04.080
They just said there was an
accident

1259
01:13:04.115 --> 01:13:05.818
with the Slip Gates.

1260
01:13:05.853 --> 01:13:07.490
We thought you were lost...

1261
01:13:07.525 --> 01:13:10.053
I am so glad you're okay!

1262
01:13:10.088 --> 01:13:12.220
We'll never give up on finding
you.

1263
01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:15.795
Even if we have to search
every planet ourselves.

1264
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:17.863
We will find you.

1265
01:13:17.898 --> 01:13:20.536
I'll see you soon, son.

1266
01:13:20.571 --> 01:13:21.834
I love you.

1267
01:13:21.869 --> 01:13:23.935
(static)

1268
01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:26.135
What do you want me to do?

1269
01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:28.676
I don't know what to tell her!

1270
01:13:28.711 --> 01:13:31.107
If I send a response...

1271
01:13:32.649 --> 01:13:34.110
Wait...

1272
01:13:34.512 --> 01:13:36.519
Send a response!

1273
01:13:36.554 --> 01:13:37.817
Trace that message!

1274
01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:40.050
Point of origin.

1275
01:13:40.085 --> 01:13:41.953
(computer beeps)

1276
01:13:41.988 --> 01:13:43.955
Ignore!

1277
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:46.760
(music builds)

1278
01:13:46.795 --> 01:13:48.960
You're all the way over there?

1279
01:13:48.995 --> 01:13:52.062
(music rises)

1280
01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.574
(negative beeps)

1281
01:13:58.609 --> 01:14:00.609
Oh come on!

1282
01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:11.147
Not yet you're not! Come on!

1283
01:14:11.182 --> 01:14:14.722
(computer loading)

1284
01:14:22.193 --> 01:14:27.031
(sweeping music)

1285
01:14:31.906 --> 01:14:34.676
(energetic beeping)

1286
01:14:34.711 --> 01:14:36.711
(cheers)

1287
01:14:38.979 --> 01:14:43.553
(reverent music)

1288
01:14:46.217 --> 01:14:48.591
There you are...

1289
01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:51.286
Wait.

1290
01:14:51.321 --> 01:14:53.288
If you're Sol...

1291
01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:56.533
You can be my reference point!

1292
01:14:56.902 --> 01:14:59.635
Triangulate position.

1293
01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:02.737
Point of reference.

1294
01:15:02.772 --> 01:15:06.136
Using that star.

1295
01:15:06.171 --> 01:15:09.711
As Sol...

1296
01:15:09.746 --> 01:15:12.549
(processing)

1297
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:19.952
Cygnus B-7.

1298
01:15:19.987 --> 01:15:22.317
Cygnus B-7!

1299
01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:24.957
(anxious music)

1300
01:15:24.992 --> 01:15:27.762
Gate Op: Gate Control.
Come in this is Gate Control.

1301
01:15:27.797 --> 01:15:28.961
I'm a Sol contestant!

1302
01:15:28.996 --> 01:15:30.259
I need immediate transit-

1303
01:15:30.294 --> 01:15:31.964
Gate Op: Kid, I'm sorry.

1304
01:15:31.999 --> 01:15:33.735
But unless you've got a planet
code

1305
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:34.802
I've got nothing else-

1306
01:15:34.837 --> 01:15:36.804
Cygnus B-7!

1307
01:15:36.839 --> 01:15:37.871
We're on Cygnus B-7!

1308
01:15:37.906 --> 01:15:40.335
Gate Op: Cygnus B-7...

1309
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:42.337
Cygnus B-7?!

1310
01:15:42.372 --> 01:15:43.844
You're all the way out there!?

1311
01:15:44.079 --> 01:15:47.617
That's an H Class planet.
Unsafe for human habitation!

1312
01:15:47.652 --> 01:15:48.652
How did you-

1313
01:15:48.686 --> 01:15:49.949
Never mind! Listen!

1314
01:15:49.984 --> 01:15:52.083
Get to the Slip Gate as fast as
you can.

1315
01:15:52.118 --> 01:15:54.085
I just sent through the
activation command.

1316
01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.691
A portal will be up soon.

1317
01:15:55.726 --> 01:15:57.121
Wait! You gotta delay it!

1318
01:15:57.156 --> 01:15:58.628
I have to find my friends first!

1319
01:15:58.663 --> 01:16:00.861
That gate's not stable
enough to hold for long!

1320
01:16:00.896 --> 01:16:03.765
A few minutes tops and
it's gonna collapse for good!

1321
01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.229
Come home now while you still
can!

1322
01:16:06.264 --> 01:16:09.265
(building music)

1323
01:16:20.014 --> 01:16:24.918
(sweeping music)

1324
01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.855
Take Adrian and get to the Slip
Gate!

1325
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:29.219
What about you?!

1326
01:16:29.254 --> 01:16:31.254
I gotta find Lex!

1327
01:16:43.202 --> 01:16:44.971
We don't have any time! You go
ahead!

1328
01:16:45.006 --> 01:16:46.973
No! We're all going home!

1329
01:16:47.008 --> 01:16:48.337
Give him to me!

1330
01:16:48.372 --> 01:16:50.372
Go!

1331
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:57.280
(Slip Gate crackles loudly)

1332
01:16:57.315 --> 01:16:59.282
Let's go! Hurry!

1333
01:17:00.857 --> 01:17:03.121
(Hunters roar in distance)

1334
01:17:03.156 --> 01:17:04.892
Did you hear that?

1335
01:17:04.927 --> 01:17:06.091
Don't worry about it!

1336
01:17:06.126 --> 01:17:07.224
They do that every night

1337
01:17:07.259 --> 01:17:09.292
when they're burned by the fire!

1338
01:17:09.327 --> 01:17:11.459
Should be ready in a few
minutes!

1339
01:17:11.494 --> 01:17:12.900
(more Hunter cries)

1340
01:17:12.935 --> 01:17:14.935
Wait!

1341
01:17:16.774 --> 01:17:19.071
That one didn't come from the
forest.

1342
01:17:19.106 --> 01:17:21.073
How did they-

1343
01:17:21.108 --> 01:17:22.305
(more Hunters roar)

1344
01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:23.845
Kit! You didn't-

1345
01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.715
I'm sorry!

1346
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:27.915
I didn't think we'd make it.

1347
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:29.917
It's not gonna form in time!

1348
01:17:29.952 --> 01:17:31.919
(ominous music)

1349
01:17:31.954 --> 01:17:34.185
If we run we might
be able to get away from them!

1350
01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:35.483
The portal's gonna collapse!

1351
01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:37.089
It can't re-open after this!

1352
01:17:37.124 --> 01:17:39.993
We can try and fix it
later but right now we have to-

1353
01:17:40.028 --> 01:17:41.258
(Hunters closing in)

1354
01:17:41.293 --> 01:17:42.226
Run!

1355
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:43.425
No!

1356
01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:45.867
We're not running anymore!

1357
01:17:45.902 --> 01:17:46.967
You're going home.

1358
01:17:47.002 --> 01:17:47.902
What?!

1359
01:17:47.937 --> 01:17:49.101
No we can't leave you!

1360
01:17:49.136 --> 01:17:50.839
I'll buy you some time.

1361
01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:52.203
Take Adrian with you.

1362
01:17:52.238 --> 01:17:54.436
Take Adrian!

1363
01:17:55.912 --> 01:17:57.912
Take it!

1364
01:17:57.947 --> 01:18:00.475
(rising music)

1365
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:01.949
Go home.

1366
01:18:01.984 --> 01:18:03.313
What are you doing, Tyl?!

1367
01:18:03.348 --> 01:18:06.151
Have you even thought about
this?!

1368
01:18:07.352 --> 01:18:13.026
(sweeping, hopeful music)

1369
01:18:13.061 --> 01:18:15.358
Go home, guys.

1370
01:18:15.393 --> 01:18:18.768
(Gate crackles with energy)

1371
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:22.332
(Hunters roar in background)

1372
01:18:26.239 --> 01:18:30.010
(rising, tense music)

1373
01:18:45.324 --> 01:18:48.897
(Hunters in distance)

1374
01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.445
(loud explosion)

1375
01:19:09.747 --> 01:19:12.888
(Hunters roar angrily)

1376
01:19:19.259 --> 01:19:23.932
(Hunters attack)

1377
01:19:24.935 --> 01:19:28.464
(Gate explodes with life)

1378
01:19:36.012 --> 01:19:41.246
(Gate explodes with energy)

1379
01:19:42.216 --> 01:19:46.152
(silence)

1380
01:19:47.386 --> 01:19:49.991
VO: Here we stand,

1381
01:19:50.026 --> 01:19:52.961
on the shoulders of giants.

1382
01:19:53.263 --> 01:19:55.260
These are our words.

1383
01:19:55.295 --> 01:19:57.867
And our sacred charge.

1384
01:19:58.603 --> 01:20:01.596
Greatness is the foundation of
our world.

1385
01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:05.105
Greatness let us survive
centuries of strife.

1386
01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:07.371
Tame the physical world to our
will.

1387
01:20:07.406 --> 01:20:09.472
And spread across the stars

1388
01:20:09.507 --> 01:20:12.541
at the speed of light.

1389
01:20:12.576 --> 01:20:16.248
That same greatness may be in
you.

1390
01:20:16.283 --> 01:20:19.251
Now, it's time to find out...

1391
01:20:19.286 --> 01:20:23.893
(rising music)

1392
01:20:27.558 --> 01:20:35.558
(hopeful music)

1393
01:20:44.245 --> 01:20:48.643
Welcome to Sol Invictus...
