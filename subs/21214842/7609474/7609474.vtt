1
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.585
Here we stand,
on the shoulders of giants.

2
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.488
These are our words

3
00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:55.657
and our sacred charge.

4
00:00:55.692 --> 00:00:59.364
Greatness is the foundation of
our world.

5
00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.433
Greatness let us survive
centuries of strife.

6
00:01:02.468 --> 00:01:04.534
Tame the world to our will,

7
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.901
and spread across the stars
at the speed of light.

8
00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:12.542
That same greatness may be in
you.

9
00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:16.546
Now it's time to find out.

10
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:19.417
Your Academies have nominated
you

11
00:01:19.452 --> 00:01:20.583
for your ambition,

12
00:01:20.618 --> 00:01:24.224
your drive, your potential for
greatness.

13
00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.457
It's time to prove yourself
worthy

14
00:01:26.492 --> 00:01:31.495
in the Sol Invictus games...

15
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.499
You and your team will
be cast across the stars

16
00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:36.896
to a pre-selected planet.

17
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.800
Your mission is a race against
time

18
00:01:39.835 --> 00:01:42.308
and a triumph of will.

19
00:01:42.343 --> 00:01:44.310
You are to set up camp

20
00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:46.543
establish a foothold for your
Academy

21
00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:49.810
and use all the tools at your
disposal.

22
00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:52.747
You are to search the sky and
pinpoint

23
00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:54.749
out of all the stars in the sky

24
00:01:54.784 --> 00:02:00.194
which is Earth's sun: Sol.

25
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:07.894
But be warned: only one team can
win

26
00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.798
and each Academy has sent their
best

27
00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:13.636
and brightest to compete against
you.

28
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:15.902
Your team Captain will lead you.

29
00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:18.278
Your Astronomer will search the
skies.

30
00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:20.511
And your team must form a
cohesive unit

31
00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:22.843
to have any hope of victory.

32
00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:27.947
We're strong together, broken
apart.

33
00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:31.324
Eternal glory awaits the winner.

34
00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.524
Use all the tools and wits you
have

35
00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.427
to prove your greatness.

36
00:02:35.462 --> 00:02:37.330
But move quickly.

37
00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:40.531
Only the victorious team may
return home.

38
00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:43.435
The cosmos are dark and
dangerous.

39
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.241
There's no room for mediocrity.

40
00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.773
Return a champion or not at all.

41
00:02:51.808 --> 00:02:55.480
Winning is the only rule.

42
00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.453
Welcome to Sol Invictus...

43
00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:12.266
We have to turn it off!

44
00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:13.762
What about the rest of them?

45
00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:15.764
They haven't made it out yet!

46
00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.273
Leave 'em! The Slip Gate's gonna
collapse!

47
00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:25.774
I can fix this!

48
00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:29.745
Take this!

49
00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.587
They're still inside!

50
00:03:36.622 --> 00:03:38.688
Look out!

51
00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:40.690
That's all I can do!

52
00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:43.495
Clear out! Run!

53
00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:16.022
Okay listen up.

54
00:04:16.057 --> 00:04:17.826
Something must have happened to
the gate.

55
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:19.828
The rest of our teams haven't
come through.

56
00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:22.864
Am I the only Team Captain?

57
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.405
Eli?

58
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:28.639
What are you doing here?

59
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:30.608
I came out.

60
00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:32.379
With Virgo Academy.

61
00:04:32.414 --> 00:04:35.448
Is anyone here a Team Engineer?

62
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.944
What's your name?

63
00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.815
Ira. From Aries Academy.

64
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.817
Come with me.

65
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.440
The rest of my team,
they hadn't come through yet!

66
00:05:00.475 --> 00:05:01.771
My brother was with them.

67
00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:03.773
Mine too. Listen to me, Ira.

68
00:05:03.808 --> 00:05:05.511
Can you get the rest of my team
through?

69
00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:08.514
I don't know. I've never
worked a Slip Gate before.

70
00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:09.812
They don't teach us how.

71
00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:11.583
I need you to try. Try hard.

72
00:05:11.618 --> 00:05:14.355
I still have a competition to
win.

73
00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:17.457
I think...

74
00:05:17.492 --> 00:05:19.756
I think it's broken on our end.

75
00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.671
Hey!

76
00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:35.068
Pick it up.

77
00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:36.740
What?

78
00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:39.446
You're a Team Chronicle.
You need to record this!

79
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:40.645
There's nothing to record.

80
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.647
My team didn't make it through.

81
00:05:42.682 --> 00:05:44.616
There's enough of my team to
compete.

82
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:47.553
We need a Chronicle to prove our
win.

83
00:05:47.588 --> 00:05:48.851
You're one of us now, shrimp.

84
00:05:48.886 --> 00:05:49.918
My name's Kit!

85
00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:51.458
Kyle Ian Troy.

86
00:05:51.493 --> 00:05:54.725
Well now you're a Gemini, Kit.

87
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.156
Now pick it up!

88
00:06:02.702 --> 00:06:04.702
Lee?

89
00:06:05.672 --> 00:06:07.936
What about the rest of them?

90
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:09.938
Leave 'em.

91
00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:11.940
They're just dead weight.

92
00:06:11.975 --> 00:06:14.074
A lot of our team didn't make it
through.

93
00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:16.780
We could use the extra hands.

94
00:06:16.815 --> 00:06:19.750
The rest of you, you're coming
with us.

95
00:06:19.785 --> 00:06:22.654
You're all from Gemini now.

96
00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:25.591
I'm not on your team.

97
00:06:26.627 --> 00:06:28.462
Why should I follow you?

98
00:06:28.497 --> 00:06:29.925
Your teammates aren't coming.

99
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.597
Face it.

100
00:06:31.632 --> 00:06:35.029
Come with us and you may
get credit as part of our team.

101
00:06:35.064 --> 00:06:37.097
Don't want to be one of us? Then
stay.

102
00:06:37.132 --> 00:06:39.473
You can be our competition...

103
00:06:39.508 --> 00:06:41.640
Your call.

104
00:06:59.055 --> 00:07:00.857
This isn't right.

105
00:07:00.892 --> 00:07:04.025
The games are supposed
to be on a forest world.

106
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.500
Make sure to include
that in your Chronicle.

107
00:07:06.535 --> 00:07:09.162
Judges won't believe this
unless they see proof.

108
00:07:09.197 --> 00:07:14.134
Maybe we'll get a special
honor for winning out here.

109
00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.203
Do you think this happened
to the girl's Games too?

110
00:07:17.238 --> 00:07:20.646
We'd have heard wouldn't we?

111
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:29.281
If we're going to find Sol
first we need to set up,

112
00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:31.283
learn the area.

113
00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:33.285
Scouts, this way. Scour the
place.

114
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.529
Find anything that might be
useful.

115
00:07:37.962 --> 00:07:39.797
I know you!

116
00:07:39.832 --> 00:07:41.667
You're the guy that won last
year.

117
00:07:41.702 --> 00:07:43.570
You won Sol Invictus!

118
00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:47.134
But... You were disqualified
weren't you?

119
00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:50.643
That's right! You were DQ'd for
cheating.

120
00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:53.239
Must have been embarrassing
to have that taken away.

121
00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:55.241
I'd watch what I was saying

122
00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:58.013
if I didn't have my team here
to back me up...

123
00:07:58.048 --> 00:07:59.619
Maybe you should.

124
00:07:59.654 --> 00:08:02.754
You two, you know each other?

125
00:08:04.153 --> 00:08:05.185
We used to.

126
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.220
What class are you?

127
00:08:06.254 --> 00:08:07.594
Astronomer.

128
00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:09.024
I'm Eli from Virgo.

129
00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:11.026
We've already got an Astronomer.

130
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:13.028
Lee, should we drop this one?

131
00:08:13.063 --> 00:08:14.161
What about you?

132
00:08:14.196 --> 00:08:15.162
Me?

133
00:08:15.197 --> 00:08:16.801
You're scouts now.

134
00:08:16.836 --> 00:08:18.902
Find everything you can about
this place.

135
00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:21.740
But we don't have weapons.
What if it's dangerous?

136
00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:23.742
Then you'll be the first to
know.

137
00:08:23.777 --> 00:08:25.744
Strength in numbers, right?

138
00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:28.076
Rest of you scouts, let's move
out!

139
00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:30.243
I want camp set up before
sunset!

140
00:08:30.278 --> 00:08:33.983
We've got a lot of stars to
search through.

141
00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:40.792
This could go on for miles.

142
00:08:40.827 --> 00:08:43.256
And I think the air is thinner
out here.

143
00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:53.739
They're not going to send
any search parties.

144
00:08:53.774 --> 00:08:55.741
They don't send help.

145
00:08:55.776 --> 00:08:58.106
But we're on the wrong planet.
Won't they come looking?

146
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:01.846
You sure they know something's
wrong?

147
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.047
Did you hear that? Listen...

148
00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:11.658
Eli, wait!

149
00:09:19.701 --> 00:09:21.899
An ocean?!

150
00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:25.001
I've never seen a real one
before...

151
00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:34.846
How much do you think
this is worth back home?

152
00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:36.980
Hard to tell.

153
00:09:37.015 --> 00:09:39.213
It could go on forever.

154
00:09:39.248 --> 00:09:42.018
But it's fresh water that they
need.

155
00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:44.988
What should we do about the
Geminis?

156
00:09:45.023 --> 00:09:47.023
Should we run?

157
00:09:47.729 --> 00:09:49.927
Then what?

158
00:09:55.704 --> 00:09:57.231
Don't say that to me!

159
00:09:57.266 --> 00:09:59.233
What do you mean there's no
food?

160
00:09:59.268 --> 00:10:00.432
You're the Chef.

161
00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:03.039
It's your job to make sure
everyone is fed!

162
00:10:03.074 --> 00:10:05.041
I know that.

163
00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:08.209
It's just: all our food
was with the Porters.

164
00:10:09.078 --> 00:10:13.181
I've got a few essentials but
nothing else.

165
00:10:14.921 --> 00:10:17.889
There's not enough for
everyone...

166
00:11:25.288 --> 00:11:28.157
Kit! What are you doing?!
Record this!

167
00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:40.466
We have to go!

168
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:42.875
If we get to water maybe they
can't swim!

169
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.844
I'm not going out there!

170
00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:46.417
If we get to the ocean we might
make it!

171
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:49.409
We can't make it!

172
00:13:37.123 --> 00:13:39.519
You made it! How?

173
00:13:39.554 --> 00:13:41.356
Spent the night in a tree.

174
00:13:41.391 --> 00:13:44.326
Those - whatever they are -
hunters

175
00:13:44.361 --> 00:13:46.625
lost interest in me a few hours
ago.

176
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.903
Took the rest and left.

177
00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:57.471
It's still running!

178
00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:02.509
Maybe we can see... what
happened.

179
00:14:02.544 --> 00:14:05.446
No one should see what those
things do.

180
00:14:08.253 --> 00:14:10.484
Just the four of us?

181
00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:12.519
We're all that made it?

182
00:14:12.554 --> 00:14:14.257
What are you doing?!

183
00:14:14.292 --> 00:14:16.028
You can't just leave.

184
00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:18.294
Look what staying in a group
got the rest of them.

185
00:14:18.329 --> 00:14:20.329
I'm going solo.

186
00:14:20.364 --> 00:14:22.331
I got to camp first so this
stuff is mine.

187
00:14:22.366 --> 00:14:24.333
That's not fair you were
the first to run too!

188
00:14:24.368 --> 00:14:25.368
This stuff is mine!

189
00:14:25.402 --> 00:14:26.940
You want to prove it, shrimp?

190
00:14:26.975 --> 00:14:28.007
My name is Kit!

191
00:14:28.042 --> 00:14:28.975
Keep quiet!

192
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.977
We're not splitting up.

193
00:14:31.012 --> 00:14:34.574
If the Geminis can put
together a team so can we.

194
00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:37.247
They didn't know about
the Hunters but now we do.

195
00:14:37.282 --> 00:14:38.644
We don't even have half a team.

196
00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:41.086
You know the rules...

197
00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:45.618
There's still a team
as long as there's a Captain.

198
00:14:45.653 --> 00:14:47.620
I know the rules.

199
00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:50.128
You're an Astronomer.
I don't have to listen to you.

200
00:14:50.163 --> 00:14:52.427
Don't listen to me then.

201
00:14:53.265 --> 00:14:55.133
Listen to Tyl.

202
00:14:55.168 --> 00:14:57.938
He's the only Team Captain now.

203
00:15:01.438 --> 00:15:02.976
What are you doing!?

204
00:15:03.011 --> 00:15:06.078
I want as many eyes watching
my back as possible.

205
00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:08.542
The best chance we have
is if we stick together, right?

206
00:15:08.577 --> 00:15:09.741
Yeah but-

207
00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:12.183
Then you have to force them into
a team!

208
00:15:12.218 --> 00:15:14.218
But I'm not a Captain!

209
00:15:21.623 --> 00:15:23.491
You are now.

210
00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:26.230
So start acting like it.

211
00:15:28.036 --> 00:15:29.497
The games are over!

212
00:15:29.532 --> 00:15:32.104
There's gotta be someone
here with a communicator.

213
00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:33.468
I'm calling home.

214
00:15:33.503 --> 00:15:35.767
If someone was out here
we'd have seen them.

215
00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:37.505
We're alone.

216
00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.177
Then what are we supposed to do?

217
00:15:39.212 --> 00:15:40.378
We still have a telescope.

218
00:15:40.413 --> 00:15:42.741
We followed the Geminis because
they were supposed to win

219
00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:44.413
and get us picked up.

220
00:15:44.448 --> 00:15:45.645
We'll just do the same.

221
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.713
And those Hunters?

222
00:15:46.748 --> 00:15:50.221
We'll stick to the shore
so we can see them coming.

223
00:15:50.256 --> 00:15:51.717
Maybe they can't swim.

224
00:15:51.752 --> 00:15:54.225
Scorpius team is still out
there...

225
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.162
They'll finish what those
Hunters started.

226
00:15:57.197 --> 00:15:59.428
I'm safer hiding on my own.

227
00:15:59.463 --> 00:16:03.630
Do me a favor and stay away from
me.

228
00:16:08.076 --> 00:16:11.374
Just because we're in this
together doesn't mean we're a team.

229
00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:13.475
I'm only following you
because you have the scope.

230
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.741
I don't think so...

231
00:16:16.243 --> 00:16:18.249
Tyl, the lens is cracked.

232
00:16:18.284 --> 00:16:20.251
What?!

233
00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:23.518
See? Crack runs the whole
length.

234
00:16:23.553 --> 00:16:26.257
Great! You couldn't spot shit
with that!

235
00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:27.753
Now what, Team Captain!?

236
00:16:29.229 --> 00:16:30.723
Rescue party!

237
00:16:36.632 --> 00:16:39.138
Do you see anything!?

238
00:16:42.143 --> 00:16:44.440
Guys?

239
00:16:44.475 --> 00:16:46.574
We're not alone out here...

240
00:16:49.513 --> 00:16:52.184
What do you mean?

241
00:16:52.686 --> 00:16:55.451
See for yourself.

242
00:16:57.521 --> 00:16:59.851
Doesn't look like a rescue
party.

243
00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:01.391
Should we talk to him?

244
00:17:01.426 --> 00:17:02.459
I don't know.

245
00:17:02.494 --> 00:17:05.692
I've heard stories about
strange people off-world.

246
00:17:05.727 --> 00:17:08.332
What's he doing here?

247
00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:16.571
Whatever you do, you better
hurry.

248
00:17:23.712 --> 00:17:25.250
Where are you from!?

249
00:17:25.285 --> 00:17:26.449
Scorpius? Virgo? Corona?

250
00:17:26.484 --> 00:17:27.524
I'm not from any of those!

251
00:17:27.552 --> 00:17:29.716
Did you kill somebody who was
and take his gear?

252
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:31.157
It's nothing like that!

253
00:17:31.192 --> 00:17:32.818
I'll be the judge of that!

254
00:17:35.328 --> 00:17:37.295
You don't know what
you're doing! Let go of me!

255
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.626
You don't know what you're
doing!

256
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:40.694
You can't trust the other
Academies!

257
00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:43.433
I know! But he's not from an
Academy.

258
00:17:47.802 --> 00:17:48.935
How'd you get here?

259
00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.409
I was late for the start so
they just sent me through.

260
00:17:52.444 --> 00:17:54.642
Did they say anything about
trouble with the Gates?!

261
00:17:54.677 --> 00:17:57.414
No it was business as usual.
Why?

262
00:17:57.449 --> 00:17:59.812
Do you have a communicator?

263
00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:02.881
My teammates have all that.

264
00:18:03.554 --> 00:18:05.884
Where's my team?

265
00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.822
They didn't make it.

266
00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:13.595
You can be sad later.
We need to find a way home.

267
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.334
Do you have any equipment we can
use?

268
00:18:16.369 --> 00:18:19.469
It was all broken when I
got here so I dropped it.

269
00:18:19.504 --> 00:18:21.537
Where did you leave it?

270
00:18:21.572 --> 00:18:23.803
There was nothing worthwhile
left.

271
00:18:23.838 --> 00:18:25.409
I'm positive.

272
00:18:25.444 --> 00:18:27.774
We'll be the judge of that.

273
00:18:34.288 --> 00:18:36.915
There it is.

274
00:18:40.393 --> 00:18:42.492
That's close enough!

275
00:18:46.762 --> 00:18:48.366
Where's the rest of your team?

276
00:18:48.401 --> 00:18:49.895
I hid.

277
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.205
The rest didn't.

278
00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.834
But it looks like my fortunes
have turned.

279
00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:56.572
Step back.

280
00:18:56.607 --> 00:18:58.277
How'd you get a gun through the
Gate?

281
00:18:58.312 --> 00:19:00.279
Made it with his stuff.

282
00:19:00.314 --> 00:19:02.974
That's all the valuables the
half-wit left.

283
00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:05.515
Gate must have ruined the rest.

284
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.254
But you seem like a guy
with a lot more to give.

285
00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:09.453
What do you want?

286
00:19:09.488 --> 00:19:11.455
Your telescope for starters.

287
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.325
Mine needs some parts

288
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.228
and you're gonna give them to
me.

289
00:19:15.263 --> 00:19:17.230
Is this all in your party?

290
00:19:17.265 --> 00:19:19.595
You got a camp nearby?

291
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.927
You're gonna give me all your
belongings

292
00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:25.271
and I'll consider letting
you live to be rescued.

293
00:19:25.306 --> 00:19:27.900
We're dead without our stuff
and you know it.

294
00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:29.308
Not my problem.

295
00:19:29.343 --> 00:19:31.673
No. You can't have it.

296
00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:34.445
Show me your camp or I can just

297
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.514
kill you and find it myself!

298
00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:41.087
He's a kid!

299
00:19:41.122 --> 00:19:42.618
He'll just die on his own
anyway.

300
00:19:42.653 --> 00:19:45.357
You need parts and so do we.

301
00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:48.261
Does your telescope have a lens?

302
00:19:48.296 --> 00:19:51.429
Put it in ours and we can work
together.

303
00:19:51.464 --> 00:19:54.465
We can all go home tonight.

304
00:19:58.834 --> 00:20:01.967
Tell your friend to come over.

305
00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:21.789
You didn't bring a tent
but you brought that?

306
00:20:22.458 --> 00:20:25.397
It helps me when I'm nervous.

307
00:20:25.632 --> 00:20:27.960
Tyl, you're Team Captain.

308
00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:29.995
You get first try.

309
00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:53.557
Let me show you how it's done!

310
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:02.368
There it is.

311
00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:07.065
What?!

312
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.836
This thing is broken!

313
00:21:08.871 --> 00:21:10.101
You rigged it!

314
00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:12.840
Would we really rig it to cheat
ourselves?

315
00:21:26.823 --> 00:21:30.363
We can't do this without
the rest of our teams.

316
00:21:30.398 --> 00:21:32.365
We need their equipment.

317
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.896
What else can we do? We have to
try.

318
00:21:39.407 --> 00:21:42.705
I have no idea where Sol is. Do
you?

319
00:21:49.879 --> 00:21:51.846
Why can't you just find it?

320
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:53.386
We have no tools!

321
00:21:53.421 --> 00:21:54.849
No idea where we are

322
00:21:54.884 --> 00:21:57.852
and no idea where our sun is
hiding!

323
00:21:57.887 --> 00:21:59.590
You're so smart?

324
00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:01.526
Find it yourself.

325
00:22:14.739 --> 00:22:16.706
Can I sleep in here?

326
00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:25.077
Come on, Kit.

327
00:22:25.112 --> 00:22:27.178
We need to rest.

328
00:22:44.065 --> 00:22:48.573
Come on Kit, we'll look again
tomorrow.

329
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.827
Do you think rescue ships
will scout this area soon?

330
00:23:11.862 --> 00:23:14.192
I don't think they know
anything's wrong.

331
00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:16.194
Even if they did

332
00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:19.197
it could take months for them to
find us.

333
00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:22.068
Maybe years...

334
00:23:22.403 --> 00:23:25.874
We'll just have to survive
long enough to win.

335
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:29.713
They put us in teams
for the best chance of survival.

336
00:23:29.748 --> 00:23:31.715
We're gonna keep doing it that
way.

337
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.013
Hal, you're a cook right?

338
00:23:33.048 --> 00:23:34.817
It's your job to make sure we
can eat.

339
00:23:34.852 --> 00:23:36.984
But there's nothing out there!
I can't work like this!

340
00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:38.249
None of us should have to.

341
00:23:38.284 --> 00:23:41.021
We all have to pickup duties
we didn't want.

342
00:23:41.056 --> 00:23:44.024
Adrian, you're offense?
Find anything you can out here.

343
00:23:44.059 --> 00:23:45.564
Especially water...

344
00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:47.566
I'm Security against other
teams.

345
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:49.568
That makes me second in command.

346
00:23:49.603 --> 00:23:50.899
You can't reassign me.

347
00:23:50.934 --> 00:23:53.605
All the other teams are dead.

348
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.607
You're a Scout now.

349
00:23:55.642 --> 00:23:57.609
Lex, you're a Technician.

350
00:23:57.644 --> 00:23:59.611
Kit, you're a Chronicle?

351
00:23:59.646 --> 00:24:00.445
Keep recording.

352
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.747
If we do get back you're the
only one

353
00:24:03.782 --> 00:24:05.782
that can prove we didn't cheat.

354
00:24:05.817 --> 00:24:07.817
We're all a team now.

355
00:24:32.844 --> 00:24:34.910
Gone...

356
00:24:34.945 --> 00:24:36.912
It's all gone.

357
00:24:36.947 --> 00:24:39.112
There has to be good water
somewhere.

358
00:24:39.147 --> 00:24:40.883
We just have to find it.

359
00:24:40.918 --> 00:24:42.951
What are we supposed to do till
then?

360
00:24:42.986 --> 00:24:44.953
Stop sweating?

361
00:24:45.155 --> 00:24:48.220
I can't keep going on like this.

362
00:24:50.829 --> 00:24:52.191
He's got water!

363
00:24:52.226 --> 00:24:53.192
What?

364
00:24:53.227 --> 00:24:54.963
There! In his jacket!

365
00:24:54.998 --> 00:24:56.965
I don't have any water!

366
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.736
If I did I wouldn't share it
with you...

367
00:24:58.771 --> 00:24:59.935
His lips are wet.

368
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.574
You think I've got water?

369
00:25:01.609 --> 00:25:02.839
Try and take it.

370
00:25:02.874 --> 00:25:04.874
See what happens.

371
00:25:14.215 --> 00:25:17.282
Howard, wait!

372
00:25:23.224 --> 00:25:28.029
Don't drink that!
You're gonna make it worse!

373
00:25:29.263 --> 00:25:32.638
It's fresh...

374
00:25:34.675 --> 00:25:36.235
Fresh! It's fresh!

375
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.237
Fresh water!

376
00:25:38.272 --> 00:25:40.239
Can you imagine what
this is worth back home?

377
00:25:40.274 --> 00:25:42.109
They could stop drilling the
moon.

378
00:25:42.144 --> 00:25:43.682
And Europa...

379
00:25:43.717 --> 00:25:45.981
This could change everything!

380
00:25:47.853 --> 00:25:49.820
How could they have missed this?

381
00:25:49.855 --> 00:25:52.790
The Gate must have been built
before the oceans dried.

382
00:25:52.825 --> 00:25:54.660
They weren't looking.

383
00:26:18.345 --> 00:26:20.312
Lex!

384
00:26:21.953 --> 00:26:23.183
Hold him down!

385
00:26:23.218 --> 00:26:25.185
Kit! Water now!

386
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.693
Kit, come on!

387
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.096
What happened?

388
00:26:35.131 --> 00:26:38.429
I don't know. I don't know...

389
00:26:38.464 --> 00:26:41.300
I was just trying to find Sol

390
00:26:41.335 --> 00:26:44.204
and the damn thing shocked me!

391
00:26:44.239 --> 00:26:46.206
Nice job putting it together.

392
00:26:46.241 --> 00:26:48.208
You trying to kill me?!

393
00:26:48.243 --> 00:26:50.782
What's this for?

394
00:26:51.719 --> 00:26:54.313
Part of the scope is open.

395
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.053
You were trying to cheat!

396
00:26:58.088 --> 00:27:00.825
You tried tricking it
to think you found Sol!

397
00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.354
But scopes are tamper proof!

398
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:04.895
Yeah it shocked him in defense!

399
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.864
Does it still work!?

400
00:27:09.902 --> 00:27:11.132
Yeah.

401
00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:13.134
We should throw him out.

402
00:27:13.169 --> 00:27:15.741
Before he pulls something like
this again.

403
00:27:15.776 --> 00:27:16.973
Lex?

404
00:27:17.008 --> 00:27:20.845
Do it! I dare you!

405
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.884
You need me as much as I need
your stuff.

406
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.285
That's what I thought.

407
00:27:34.454 --> 00:27:36.828
Thanks for the water!

408
00:27:36.863 --> 00:27:39.259
You're not letting him get
away with that are you?

409
00:27:39.294 --> 00:27:41.261
You have to kick him out!

410
00:27:41.296 --> 00:27:42.460
I'm not doing that!

411
00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:44.737
What if he cheats again, or does
worse?

412
00:27:44.772 --> 00:27:45.671
What will you do?

413
00:27:45.707 --> 00:27:48.037
Maybe we'll need his help! I
don't know-

414
00:27:48.072 --> 00:27:49.775
What do you know?!

415
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.942
Have you ever led anyone?

416
00:27:51.977 --> 00:27:54.373
How long have you even been a
Team Captain?

417
00:27:55.211 --> 00:27:57.178
No.

418
00:27:57.213 --> 00:27:59.213
You can't handle this.

419
00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:23.534
Look for a clearing.

420
00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:26.207
Any opening big enough to gather
logs.

421
00:28:26.242 --> 00:28:28.308
But we have a light,
we don't need to build a fire.

422
00:28:28.343 --> 00:28:29.540
Not for that!

423
00:28:29.575 --> 00:28:30.948
Then what?

424
00:28:30.983 --> 00:28:33.412
We're not making a fire, kid.

425
00:28:33.447 --> 00:28:34.820
It's for a boat.

426
00:28:34.855 --> 00:28:36.085
Why?

427
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.087
We're leaving.

428
00:28:38.122 --> 00:28:42.421
Do you really want to stay
with those Hunters?

429
00:28:43.358 --> 00:28:45.061
What if this is the only land?

430
00:28:45.096 --> 00:28:46.799
You'd rather wait here to be
eaten?

431
00:28:46.834 --> 00:28:48.064
Look...

432
00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:51.199
This can't be the only land.

433
00:28:51.234 --> 00:28:53.971
Someone's gotta be out there.

434
00:28:54.006 --> 00:28:55.335
And we can find 'em.

435
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.371
And contact home.

436
00:28:59.209 --> 00:29:00.912
Now go.

437
00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:04.410
Find logs. Get good ones.

438
00:29:28.634 --> 00:29:31.338
I can't hold on!

439
00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:33.979
Lex!

440
00:29:34.013 --> 00:29:35.375
I'm slipping!

441
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.377
Somebody help me!

442
00:29:37.412 --> 00:29:39.049
Anybody!

443
00:29:39.084 --> 00:29:40.215
Help!

444
00:29:41.889 --> 00:29:43.856
Hang on!

445
00:29:43.891 --> 00:29:45.858
It's gonna pull us in too!

446
00:29:45.893 --> 00:29:47.222
Help!

447
00:30:19.157 --> 00:30:21.058
Tyl, help us!

448
00:30:21.093 --> 00:30:24.094
We need your help! Hurry!

449
00:30:32.537 --> 00:30:34.874
I think he's poisoned.

450
00:30:35.701 --> 00:30:37.943
It's killing him.

451
00:30:40.442 --> 00:30:42.343
What do we do?!

452
00:30:44.512 --> 00:30:46.578
Right here!

453
00:30:47.013 --> 00:30:49.383
The med-pack!

454
00:30:51.959 --> 00:30:53.959
Here!

455
00:30:54.861 --> 00:30:58.458
The venom's bad.
I don't know if he'll make it!

456
00:30:58.493 --> 00:31:01.692
Here, you clean the wound!

457
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:11.702
Where's the sting kit!?

458
00:31:11.737 --> 00:31:13.946
I'm looking!

459
00:31:14.281 --> 00:31:16.542
Oh no. It's broken!

460
00:31:16.577 --> 00:31:18.544
Are there more?

461
00:31:18.579 --> 00:31:20.546
Hurry!

462
00:31:20.581 --> 00:31:23.153
This is our last one.

463
00:31:23.188 --> 00:31:26.420
Wait! We gotta save it.

464
00:31:26.455 --> 00:31:27.421
What?!

465
00:31:27.456 --> 00:31:28.994
What if one of us gets stung?

466
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:30.424
He's right.

467
00:31:30.459 --> 00:31:33.130
Use it now and you won't
have one for yourself later.

468
00:31:33.165 --> 00:31:36.001
But he's hurt now!

469
00:31:36.465 --> 00:31:39.103
Use it, Tyl!

470
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.985
Think there could be
more of those things, Lex?

471
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.220
If we're stuck here
it's not long till we find out.

472
00:32:04.493 --> 00:32:07.593
We're not going to
make it out of here are we?

473
00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:24.709
How long will this last?

474
00:32:30.783 --> 00:32:32.750
They're coming!

475
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:40.725
I'm not staying here. Not again!

476
00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.298
Me neither!

477
00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:44.300
He'll bring the Hunters right to
us!

478
00:32:45.303 --> 00:32:46.135
Leave him!

479
00:32:46.171 --> 00:32:48.304
Someone has to stay and keep him
quiet

480
00:32:48.339 --> 00:32:50.306
or they'll find him for sure!

481
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.212
Eli's the only one that
doesn't do his job anymore.

482
00:32:55.247 --> 00:32:56.642
He's least essential.

483
00:32:56.677 --> 00:32:57.509
Hey! I-

484
00:32:57.545 --> 00:33:01.350
I record, Hal cooks, Lex fixes
things

485
00:33:01.385 --> 00:33:02.747
and Tyl saves people.

486
00:33:02.782 --> 00:33:05.750
Have you found Sol yet?

487
00:33:05.785 --> 00:33:08.588
No but I try every night!

488
00:33:08.623 --> 00:33:10.161
He's right, Eli.

489
00:33:10.196 --> 00:33:12.163
You're the least important.

490
00:33:12.198 --> 00:33:14.495
Stay here with Adrian.

491
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.794
Okay...

492
00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:18.796
Lex, is that gun still in your
pack?

493
00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:20.798
No, stay out of my pack!

494
00:33:20.833 --> 00:33:22.800
Leave it! No time!

495
00:33:49.895 --> 00:33:52.500
There! At our camp.

496
00:33:57.408 --> 00:33:59.375
What are you doing?

497
00:34:09.717 --> 00:34:14.687
If they go after Eli then
they won't come after us.

498
00:34:33.675 --> 00:34:35.345
You tried to kill me!

499
00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.447
Don't pity yourself too much.
You look fine...

500
00:34:38.482 --> 00:34:40.680
Whatever you did to chase them
off worked.

501
00:34:40.715 --> 00:34:42.550
I didn't do anything!

502
00:34:42.585 --> 00:34:46.158
Something kept them away...

503
00:34:51.924 --> 00:34:53.759
The light!

504
00:34:53.794 --> 00:34:54.694
What?

505
00:34:54.729 --> 00:34:57.664
Maybe they're afraid of it.

506
00:34:59.338 --> 00:35:02.273
We have only seen them at night.

507
00:35:02.308 --> 00:35:04.737
Maybe the light hurts them.

508
00:35:04.772 --> 00:35:06.541
Burns them.

509
00:35:06.576 --> 00:35:08.510
Do you think it's just the
lantern?

510
00:35:08.545 --> 00:35:09.940
I don't know.

511
00:35:09.975 --> 00:35:14.318
But it's not gonna last
forever...

512
00:35:29.368 --> 00:35:31.929
As long as there are people on
this island

513
00:35:31.964 --> 00:35:36.208
there will be a fire...

514
00:36:16.745 --> 00:36:18.910
Are we sure this will work?

515
00:36:18.945 --> 00:36:21.286
Will fire really keep them away?

516
00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:22.617
I don't know.

517
00:36:22.652 --> 00:36:24.619
When will we know!?

518
00:36:24.654 --> 00:36:28.656
When the Hunters come and eat us
or not!

519
00:36:29.494 --> 00:36:32.297
We should get some rest.

520
00:36:32.332 --> 00:36:34.596
I can't sleep like this.

521
00:36:34.631 --> 00:36:37.434
Me neither.

522
00:37:02.791 --> 00:37:05.792
Where's Lex?

523
00:37:05.827 --> 00:37:07.926
Who cares.

524
00:37:07.961 --> 00:37:10.434
We're almost out of wood.

525
00:37:12.768 --> 00:37:15.340
Who's coming with?

526
00:37:15.375 --> 00:37:18.277
I can't go back out there.

527
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.584
Guess you were right about the
light.

528
00:39:31.577 --> 00:39:33.775
What? What happened?!

529
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.811
We found something!

530
00:39:41.917 --> 00:39:44.918
I've never seen one before
but...

531
00:39:44.953 --> 00:39:46.623
I think it's a Storm runner!

532
00:39:46.658 --> 00:39:48.053
Can't be! That would mean it's

533
00:39:48.088 --> 00:39:51.221
Over two hundred years old...

534
00:39:58.637 --> 00:40:01.539
Where's the rest of it?

535
00:40:07.041 --> 00:40:08.810
It's still intact!

536
00:40:08.845 --> 00:40:09.778
What is?

537
00:40:09.813 --> 00:40:13.045
The computer core, it's still
functional!

538
00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:17.148
But the control element's gone.

539
00:40:17.183 --> 00:40:18.985
Without that it's useless.

540
00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.987
Just needs a jump-start huh?

541
00:40:21.022 --> 00:40:22.989
This is a waste of our time,
Tyl.

542
00:40:23.024 --> 00:40:25.761
I didn't bring you here for
nostalgia.

543
00:40:25.796 --> 00:40:28.533
I need help carrying something.

544
00:40:28.568 --> 00:40:30.535
What are we supposed to do with
this junk?!

545
00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.537
Look how old it is!

546
00:40:32.572 --> 00:40:34.869
That's not junk you're looking
at.

547
00:40:34.904 --> 00:40:37.641
There's a Trans-Conduit relay in
there.

548
00:40:37.676 --> 00:40:38.939
You sure?

549
00:40:38.974 --> 00:40:42.646
Checked it myself. Still works.

550
00:40:42.681 --> 00:40:44.714
I know what you're thinking.

551
00:40:44.749 --> 00:40:47.651
But if we screw this up
it could ruin the telescope.

552
00:40:47.686 --> 00:40:50.819
Isn't it worth the risk?

553
00:41:04.065 --> 00:41:08.573
This was a Hyperion ship...

554
00:41:09.108 --> 00:41:11.774
If the Hyperions couldn't
survive here

555
00:41:11.809 --> 00:41:15.745
how are we supposed to?

556
00:41:24.921 --> 00:41:27.658
A Trans-Conduit relay lets any
computer

557
00:41:27.693 --> 00:41:30.694
connect to the network
that links every system.

558
00:41:30.729 --> 00:41:32.696
If we hook it to the scope

559
00:41:32.731 --> 00:41:36.095
we might be able to
send a message back to Earth.

560
00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:37.195
Let me do it.

561
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.702
It's not that simple.

562
00:41:38.737 --> 00:41:39.934
Overload the conductor and

563
00:41:39.969 --> 00:41:41.936
the whole thing's cooked!

564
00:41:41.971 --> 00:41:43.333
That's why I'm doing it...

565
00:41:43.368 --> 00:41:45.203
How long will it take to contact
home?

566
00:41:45.238 --> 00:41:48.338
It's not as easy as calling mom
and dad...

567
00:41:48.373 --> 00:41:50.076
Connecting with Terra-Net only
lets us

568
00:41:50.111 --> 00:41:53.277
transmit messages to individual
addresses.

569
00:41:53.312 --> 00:41:56.247
If a message actually makes
it...

570
00:41:56.282 --> 00:41:58.249
They'll have to record their own
reply

571
00:41:58.284 --> 00:42:01.626
and hope it finds its way
back to the scope.

572
00:42:01.661 --> 00:42:03.089
Which it won't.

573
00:42:03.124 --> 00:42:04.354
If someone responds

574
00:42:04.389 --> 00:42:06.895
we can triangulate our position

575
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.194
and have them send help.

576
00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:12.901
Here we go...

577
00:42:14.806 --> 00:42:15.673
Did you break it?

578
00:42:15.708 --> 00:42:16.839
Can we fix it?

579
00:42:16.874 --> 00:42:18.368
It's fine, I just need my
splicer.

580
00:42:18.403 --> 00:42:19.369
Where is it?

581
00:42:19.404 --> 00:42:20.645
My pack, I'll get it.

582
00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.307
No you keep working on it.
Howard?

583
00:42:56.749 --> 00:42:58.078
What are you doing with that?!

584
00:42:58.113 --> 00:43:00.344
Shut your goddamn mouth!

585
00:43:00.379 --> 00:43:01.312
What's the matter?

586
00:43:01.347 --> 00:43:03.215
Day-Assessed Slip Gate.

587
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.184
Unable to establish return
portal

588
00:43:05.219 --> 00:43:07.725
for more than three seconds.

589
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.727
Replaced coupler. No
improvement.

590
00:43:09.762 --> 00:43:12.224
Day-Gemini telescope battery

591
00:43:12.259 --> 00:43:14.798
unable to jump-start Gate.

592
00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:17.702
Day-Energy source to power Gate

593
00:43:17.737 --> 00:43:19.297
needs to be larger.

594
00:43:19.332 --> 00:43:20.903
Day-Found crashed ship.

595
00:43:20.938 --> 00:43:22.806
Should be able to salvage parts

596
00:43:22.841 --> 00:43:24.038
to stabilize Gate.

597
00:43:24.073 --> 00:43:25.402
He has been sneaking off

598
00:43:25.437 --> 00:43:28.977
and working on the Slip Gate all
this time!

599
00:43:29.848 --> 00:43:31.947
Can you fix it?

600
00:43:32.279 --> 00:43:33.982
No.

601
00:43:34.017 --> 00:43:35.984
We don't have the parts.

602
00:43:36.019 --> 00:43:36.985
Why didn't you tell us?

603
00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.087
Because he didn't
want to bring us with him!

604
00:43:40.122 --> 00:43:42.386
He was going to leave us here

605
00:43:42.421 --> 00:43:44.828
so that he can go home
and win the games on his own.

606
00:43:44.863 --> 00:43:46.830
I would have sent help when I
got back!

607
00:43:46.865 --> 00:43:49.129
You've been lying to us this
whole time!

608
00:43:49.164 --> 00:43:51.131
How do you know so much
about Slip Gates, Lex?

609
00:43:51.166 --> 00:43:52.968
Nobody's allowed to learn how
they work-

610
00:43:53.003 --> 00:43:54.937
You did this, didn't you?

611
00:43:54.972 --> 00:43:56.939
Didn't you!?

612
00:43:56.974 --> 00:43:59.711
You sabotaged the Slip Gate
network...

613
00:43:59.746 --> 00:44:01.174
You rigged it so we'd be stuck

614
00:44:01.209 --> 00:44:03.440
on this backwater planet
with no chance of winning.

615
00:44:03.475 --> 00:44:05.981
But you did too good of a job.

616
00:44:06.016 --> 00:44:07.785
Your team crashed the network so
bad

617
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.413
that it sucked everyone in.

618
00:44:09.448 --> 00:44:11.415
You fell into your own trap.

619
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:12.757
Is he right?

620
00:44:12.792 --> 00:44:13.923
Tell us!

621
00:44:13.958 --> 00:44:14.958
Why'd you do it!?

622
00:44:14.992 --> 00:44:17.927
Because I have to win!

623
00:44:20.228 --> 00:44:23.867
If I don't bring back that
Hyperion coin...

624
00:44:25.167 --> 00:44:27.299
You wouldn't understand.

625
00:44:27.334 --> 00:44:29.466
I had to do it!

626
00:44:29.501 --> 00:44:31.743
Everything that's happened...

627
00:44:31.778 --> 00:44:33.745
Everything!

628
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.944
It's all your fault.

629
00:44:34.979 --> 00:44:36.473
That night with the Hunters

630
00:44:36.508 --> 00:44:39.014
you tried killing me to hide the
journal.

631
00:44:39.049 --> 00:44:40.510
Instead I saved you!

632
00:44:40.545 --> 00:44:44.184
Where would we be if we didn't
learn what light can do?!

633
00:44:44.219 --> 00:44:45.757
And the rest?

634
00:44:45.792 --> 00:44:48.793
This is Sol Invictus.

635
00:44:48.828 --> 00:44:51.125
Winning's the only rule.

636
00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.457
They should have known
what they were getting in to.

637
00:44:53.492 --> 00:44:55.294
Wrap it however you want.

638
00:44:55.329 --> 00:44:58.198
If you hadn't done that, we'd be
home now!

639
00:44:58.233 --> 00:45:02.301
And innocent people would still
be alive.

640
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:06.503
I feel sorry for you.

641
00:45:17.417 --> 00:45:19.021
What are we gonna do with him?

642
00:45:19.056 --> 00:45:20.792
Can't trust him anymore.

643
00:45:20.827 --> 00:45:22.959
Before you do anything rash,

644
00:45:22.994 --> 00:45:24.895
afraid I need him over here.

645
00:45:25.997 --> 00:45:28.558
The relay's almost done.

646
00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:30.395
Go.

647
00:45:50.021 --> 00:45:51.515
The signal's too weak.

648
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:53.088
That's as good as we're gonna
get.

649
00:45:53.123 --> 00:45:55.123
That won't get the messages
half way to Earth!

650
00:45:55.158 --> 00:45:58.192
Then we'll try anyway!

651
00:46:02.368 --> 00:46:06.266
This is Lex of Scorpius
to anyone at command.

652
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:08.906
Hi, Mom and Dad...

653
00:46:09.241 --> 00:46:12.239
By now you've probably heard
from school.

654
00:46:12.274 --> 00:46:15.143
We've no idea where we are.

655
00:46:15.178 --> 00:46:17.145
Nobody does.

656
00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.147
My assignment

657
00:46:19.182 --> 00:46:22.513
did more than we could have
imagined.

658
00:46:22.548 --> 00:46:25.318
Trapping me on the same

659
00:46:25.353 --> 00:46:28.288
unknown planet as the rest of
them.

660
00:46:28.323 --> 00:46:31.093
Why did I come out here?

661
00:46:31.595 --> 00:46:34.228
Was I wrong about all this?

662
00:46:34.263 --> 00:46:36.593
Everything I did,

663
00:46:36.628 --> 00:46:39.332
I did for the mission.

664
00:47:52.407 --> 00:47:55.210
Please respond.

665
00:47:55.245 --> 00:47:57.707
Please...

666
00:47:57.742 --> 00:48:00.380
Say anything.

667
00:48:00.415 --> 00:48:03.152
I'll win.

668
00:48:03.587 --> 00:48:05.649
One way or the other.

669
00:48:05.684 --> 00:48:08.025
I can't wait to get home.

670
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.456
I love you guys.

671
00:48:10.491 --> 00:48:12.491
See you soon.

672
00:48:13.329 --> 00:48:16.231
Say anything...

673
00:48:16.266 --> 00:48:19.234
I just want to hear from you.

674
00:48:34.647 --> 00:48:36.647
Let's send these things!

675
00:48:37.617 --> 00:48:39.991
Enter the address here.

676
00:48:49.035 --> 00:48:51.134
This is it!

677
00:49:00.607 --> 00:49:01.540
That's it?

678
00:49:01.575 --> 00:49:04.510
What were you expecting,
an instant response?

679
00:49:04.545 --> 00:49:06.512
It could take hours
for them to reach everyone.

680
00:49:06.547 --> 00:49:07.480
Then leave it on all night.

681
00:49:07.515 --> 00:49:10.714
I want to know the instant we
get a reply!

682
00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.597
I wonder what it looks like from
up there.

683
00:49:26.666 --> 00:49:30.206
From all those other fires.

684
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:49.291
Want to check yours?

685
00:49:52.494 --> 00:49:54.263
That's enough.

686
00:49:54.298 --> 00:49:55.693
Time to turn it off.

687
00:49:55.728 --> 00:49:56.793
Wait!

688
00:49:56.828 --> 00:49:58.729
I want to know when they hear
from me.

689
00:49:58.764 --> 00:50:01.105
If we leave it on any longer
we'll kill the battery.

690
00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.041
No!

691
00:50:03.276 --> 00:50:05.472
Wait! I want to hear back!

692
00:50:05.507 --> 00:50:07.243
Turn it off or we're really
screwed!

693
00:50:07.278 --> 00:50:08.409
Give it to me!

694
00:50:08.444 --> 00:50:10.444
Let it go!

695
00:50:20.654 --> 00:50:22.225
Give it to me.

696
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.656
So you're gonna shoot me now!?

697
00:50:25.725 --> 00:50:27.428
Give me the gun, Kit!

698
00:50:27.463 --> 00:50:28.561
No!

699
00:50:28.596 --> 00:50:30.233
Kit, give me the gun!

700
00:50:30.268 --> 00:50:31.696
Kit!

701
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:33.599
Give me the gun!

702
00:50:33.634 --> 00:50:35.601
No!

703
00:50:52.158 --> 00:50:53.388
What'd you do!?

704
00:50:53.423 --> 00:50:54.686
It was an accident!

705
00:50:54.721 --> 00:50:56.589
I- I didn't...

706
00:50:56.624 --> 00:50:58.624
What have you done?!

707
00:50:59.259 --> 00:51:02.397
Eli, please just hold still.

708
00:51:02.432 --> 00:51:04.366
Just give me a second!

709
00:51:04.401 --> 00:51:06.467
Eli!

710
00:52:26.846 --> 00:52:28.384
Of course it was his fault!

711
00:52:28.419 --> 00:52:30.386
Okay! You're right. But...

712
00:52:30.421 --> 00:52:31.750
He didn't mean to-

713
00:52:31.785 --> 00:52:34.786
He feels even worse about it
than you do.

714
00:52:35.121 --> 00:52:38.691
You can't make him sleep outside
forever.

715
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:52.606
You got us into this mess,

716
00:52:52.641 --> 00:52:54.971
it's your job to get us out.

717
00:52:55.974 --> 00:52:58.348
You're in charge now.

718
00:53:03.586 --> 00:53:06.653
Time to stop waiting.

719
00:53:22.033 --> 00:53:24.000
No way...

720
00:53:29.678 --> 00:53:31.381
Message received?

721
00:53:31.416 --> 00:53:32.778
Message received?!

722
00:53:32.813 --> 00:53:34.780
Message received!

723
00:53:34.815 --> 00:53:36.584
We got one! We got a reply!

724
00:53:36.619 --> 00:53:37.717
Somebody sent a response!

725
00:53:37.752 --> 00:53:40.049
Somebody heard from us!?

726
00:53:43.362 --> 00:53:45.626
Tyl, somebody sent a reply!

727
00:53:47.927 --> 00:53:49.564
Eli-Hi, Mom and Dad.

728
00:53:49.599 --> 00:53:50.895
We haven't received a response.

729
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:53.304
It's one of our own messages
bounced back to us.

730
00:53:53.539 --> 00:53:55.537
It didn't even make it out of
the system.

731
00:53:57.574 --> 00:53:59.310
No one received any messages.

732
00:53:59.345 --> 00:54:01.345
No one ever will!

733
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.941
I can't believe we thought
this thing would work.

734
00:54:05.978 --> 00:54:07.714
Wait a second!

735
00:54:07.749 --> 00:54:09.716
Just one of the messages bounced
back.

736
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:11.685
Others could still make it
through!

737
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.820
But if you break the telescope
we'll never know!

738
00:54:14.855 --> 00:54:16.822
To think I let you

739
00:54:16.857 --> 00:54:19.462
get my hopes up, Hal.

740
00:54:19.497 --> 00:54:21.464
You couldn't even check the
message.

741
00:54:21.499 --> 00:54:25.369
You just started dancing
around like a fat fool!

742
00:54:25.738 --> 00:54:27.767
You broke my gun.

743
00:54:27.802 --> 00:54:30.770
We lost our food because of you!

744
00:54:30.805 --> 00:54:33.069
How could anybody be so stupid

745
00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:35.071
and yet still be alive?!

746
00:54:35.106 --> 00:54:36.776
You've gotta be the most hapless
oaf

747
00:54:36.811 --> 00:54:38.745
I've ever seen in my life!

748
00:54:42.883 --> 00:54:45.521
Stop it! Hal, stop!

749
00:54:52.423 --> 00:54:55.498
I shouldn't be here.

750
00:54:55.533 --> 00:54:57.830
I want to go home.

751
00:54:59.636 --> 00:55:01.603
I want to go home!

752
00:55:03.101 --> 00:55:07.378
None of this was supposed to
happen...

753
00:55:07.413 --> 00:55:10.513
What was I thinking?

754
00:55:30.568 --> 00:55:32.062
We can't build a boat!

755
00:55:32.097 --> 00:55:34.702
Haven't you seen what's
out there? We'd never make it!

756
00:55:34.737 --> 00:55:35.670
We're trapped!

757
00:55:35.705 --> 00:55:36.738
It's our only option.

758
00:55:36.773 --> 00:55:39.608
Would you rather die here
or trying to find help?!

759
00:55:39.643 --> 00:55:41.775
There's no one out there to help
us!

760
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:43.777
It's up to us to make it back!

761
00:55:43.812 --> 00:55:45.779
You put me in charge, remember?

762
00:55:45.814 --> 00:55:47.649
Or do you think you can do
better?

763
00:55:47.684 --> 00:55:49.882
Tyl might listen to you, but I'm
not.

764
00:55:49.917 --> 00:55:52.522
I'm not going out there!
I'm not making a boat!

765
00:55:52.557 --> 00:55:53.952
Then you can live on your own.

766
00:55:53.987 --> 00:55:57.725
If you're not working
I'm kicking you out of my camp!

767
00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.595
This wouldn't be such a problem

768
00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:01.597
if you hadn't murdered our only
Astronomer!

769
00:56:03.634 --> 00:56:05.964
Hey!

770
00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:15.006
You look like shit.

771
00:56:15.712 --> 00:56:18.075
What's going on?

772
00:56:21.179 --> 00:56:23.652
Here that long, huh?

773
00:56:24.354 --> 00:56:27.557
Any more ideas how we got here?

774
00:56:30.694 --> 00:56:32.463
No.

775
00:56:32.498 --> 00:56:34.465
There is

776
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.731
one other option.

777
00:56:36.999 --> 00:56:38.931
Every year the Board of
Governors

778
00:56:38.966 --> 00:56:42.033
sends out a judge in each team
to observe.

779
00:56:42.368 --> 00:56:44.640
No one ever knows about it.

780
00:56:44.675 --> 00:56:47.170
The judges pick a contestant
from every team,

781
00:56:47.205 --> 00:56:49.205
make sure they can trust him,

782
00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:53.011
and assign him to report back on
the games.

783
00:56:53.046 --> 00:56:56.718
Sometimes I bet they even rig
it.

784
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:02.790
How'd you find this out?

785
00:57:02.825 --> 00:57:05.595
I talked it out of someone last
year.

786
00:57:06.928 --> 00:57:08.059
Now.

787
00:57:08.094 --> 00:57:10.930
No one can come home till
someone's won.

788
00:57:11.165 --> 00:57:13.504
These judges do it all the time.

789
00:57:13.539 --> 00:57:16.606
Pop home to report then slip
right back.

790
00:57:16.641 --> 00:57:18.608
Say they'd gone to
the bathroom or something.

791
00:57:18.643 --> 00:57:21.138
I know how to contact the Gate
Ops.

792
00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:23.877
Tell 'em you're a student judge,

793
00:57:23.912 --> 00:57:25.648
and they'll bring you home.

794
00:57:25.683 --> 00:57:27.650
If you were right

795
00:57:27.685 --> 00:57:29.652
I would have heard about it.

796
00:57:29.687 --> 00:57:31.786
How can we believe you?

797
00:57:31.821 --> 00:57:34.019
Because Shrimp,

798
00:57:34.588 --> 00:57:37.528
that's how I got home first.

799
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:40.597
That's how I cheated.

800
00:57:40.632 --> 00:57:42.225
I told the Slip Gate Operators

801
00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:43.534
that I was a judge.

802
00:57:43.569 --> 00:57:45.800
When I came out I raised my
scope

803
00:57:45.835 --> 00:57:48.033
and said I'd found Sol.

804
00:57:48.635 --> 00:57:51.135
The Gate Ops don't talk but

805
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:53.269
the judges figured it out.

806
00:57:53.304 --> 00:57:56.140
There's no way to contact home
or I'd have done it.

807
00:57:56.175 --> 00:57:57.812
There's one.

808
00:57:57.847 --> 00:58:01.651
That Hyperion ship
still has a working core.

809
00:58:01.686 --> 00:58:04.115
Your scope is programmed for the
Gate Ops.

810
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:05.820
If you run it through the ship

811
00:58:05.855 --> 00:58:07.184
it'll let you call for a
pick-up.

812
00:58:07.219 --> 00:58:08.889
No.

813
00:58:09.826 --> 00:58:11.826
The control element's missing.

814
00:58:11.861 --> 00:58:14.092
We'd never find it out here.

815
00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:20.065
You knew a way home

816
00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.803
and you didn't tell us?

817
00:58:21.838 --> 00:58:23.640
What were you waiting for?!

818
00:58:23.675 --> 00:58:25.741
When they realize we cheated
they'll come after us

819
00:58:25.776 --> 00:58:27.743
with everything they have.

820
00:58:27.778 --> 00:58:30.141
We'd be better off staying here.

821
00:58:30.376 --> 00:58:32.242
You made it back...

822
00:58:32.277 --> 00:58:33.914
It took

823
00:58:33.949 --> 00:58:37.720
everything my family had to get
me back in.

824
00:58:39.691 --> 00:58:41.658
I'd never do it again either.

825
00:58:41.693 --> 00:58:43.957
If not for all this.

826
00:58:43.992 --> 00:58:46.223
But look at all that's happened.

827
00:58:46.491 --> 00:58:48.632
Wouldn't they understand?

828
00:58:48.667 --> 00:58:50.095
Believe me,

829
00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:52.603
they won't care.

830
00:58:52.905 --> 00:58:55.001
If you try and explain
beforehand

831
00:58:55.036 --> 00:58:56.640
you'll just blow your cover.

832
00:58:56.675 --> 00:58:58.268
Is it really that bad?

833
00:58:58.303 --> 00:59:00.270
When you stand before them

834
00:59:00.305 --> 00:59:03.746
and see your entire future
slipping away.

835
00:59:05.112 --> 00:59:07.376
Remember how you felt today.

836
00:59:07.411 --> 00:59:09.378
Cause whoever gives them their
name

837
00:59:09.413 --> 00:59:12.590
that's the one they'll come
after worst.

838
00:59:13.021 --> 00:59:15.153
He's done.

839
00:59:16.024 --> 00:59:17.694
We'll do it.

840
00:59:17.729 --> 00:59:19.355
No.

841
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:21.027
No we won't.

842
00:59:21.062 --> 00:59:23.029
I'm in charge now remember?

843
00:59:23.064 --> 00:59:25.636
I just want to go home.

844
00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:26.901
More than anything.

845
00:59:26.936 --> 00:59:28.199
I'm sorry. I am.

846
00:59:28.234 --> 00:59:30.168
I want to go home too
but there's another way

847
00:59:30.203 --> 00:59:32.203
off this planet and I'm gonna
find it.

848
00:59:32.238 --> 00:59:36.042
You can't have the scope. I'm
sorry.

849
00:59:36.913 --> 00:59:37.978
Wait, Lex-

850
00:59:38.013 --> 00:59:39.683
No!

851
01:00:16.348 --> 01:00:18.315
Where's the scope?!

852
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.415
It's gone!

853
01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:21.252
Could he have gone to look for
Sol?

854
01:00:21.287 --> 01:00:22.385
We gotta find him!

855
01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.255
He could be anywhere by now. How
can we-

856
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:26.257
Quiet!

857
01:00:26.292 --> 01:00:28.798
Listen.

858
01:00:31.697 --> 01:00:34.870
Your camera's still connected to
it.

859
01:00:36.874 --> 01:00:39.171
I see something.

860
01:00:39.877 --> 01:00:41.844
Hal? Hal?

861
01:00:41.879 --> 01:00:44.044
Hal, what's going on!?

862
01:00:45.949 --> 01:00:47.212
I'm taking the scope.

863
01:00:47.247 --> 01:00:49.082
I won't let your ruin this. I'm
going home!

864
01:00:49.117 --> 01:00:51.381
But we need the scope.
You can't just take it!

865
01:00:51.416 --> 01:00:53.383
You know we'll never find Sol!

866
01:00:53.418 --> 01:00:56.254
But at least if I call home
we can finally leave.

867
01:00:56.289 --> 01:00:59.422
What about us?
Somebody has to take the fall!

868
01:00:59.457 --> 01:01:01.160
Don't we get a say in it?!

869
01:01:01.195 --> 01:01:02.359
I'm sorry,

870
01:01:02.394 --> 01:01:04.834
but I don't care about the
tournament.

871
01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:06.165
I can live with the
consequences,

872
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.365
my family needs me home.

873
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.773
You wouldn't understand.

874
01:01:09.808 --> 01:01:10.852
It's easy for you to talk big

875
01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:13.040
when you're the one
running with our telescope!

876
01:01:13.075 --> 01:01:14.305
What would you know?

877
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.472
I'm doing it to help someone.

878
01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:17.979
You guys have never thought

879
01:01:18.014 --> 01:01:20.014
about anybody but yourselves!

880
01:01:20.412 --> 01:01:21.818
No...

881
01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:27.252
Hal! Do you have a light?

882
01:01:27.287 --> 01:01:29.518
You need to get back to camp.
Hurry!

883
01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:31.355
I think I hear something.

884
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:33.258
Where are you, Hal?

885
01:01:33.293 --> 01:01:34.930
I'm in the forest.

886
01:01:34.965 --> 01:01:36.767
That's their forest.
That's where they live!

887
01:01:36.802 --> 01:01:39.198
Listen! Hide.
We're coming for you right now.

888
01:01:41.367 --> 01:01:42.872
Hal, run!

889
01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:03.090
You had your chance!

890
01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:05.323
You don't know what you're
doing!

891
01:02:05.358 --> 01:02:07.930
Why should we trust you now?

892
01:02:09.494 --> 01:02:12.099
Because I know what to do.

893
01:02:14.169 --> 01:02:16.400
I'm getting us home.

894
01:02:17.106 --> 01:02:19.106
It's Tyl's team.

895
01:02:19.141 --> 01:02:21.471
I'm with him.

896
01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:39.390
If I do this,

897
01:02:39.425 --> 01:02:43.064
do you promise you'll get us
home?

898
01:02:46.498 --> 01:02:49.367
I promise.

899
01:02:59.214 --> 01:03:01.951
It's not safe to split up.

900
01:03:01.986 --> 01:03:04.349
We'll just have to comb the
whole forest.

901
01:03:10.456 --> 01:03:13.325
No point delaying the
inevitable.

902
01:03:41.388 --> 01:03:44.257
It's quiet here.

903
01:03:44.292 --> 01:03:46.897
I don't like it.

904
01:04:00.242 --> 01:04:02.572
There it is.

905
01:04:04.213 --> 01:04:06.917
Let's make a break for it.

906
01:04:06.952 --> 01:04:08.314
Wait.

907
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:11.317
Whatever did this could still be
here.

908
01:04:56.199 --> 01:04:57.968
The telescope!

909
01:04:58.003 --> 01:04:59.200
Is it okay?!

910
01:04:59.235 --> 01:05:00.399
It's fine!

911
01:05:00.434 --> 01:05:02.434
But look...

912
01:05:11.511 --> 01:05:13.313
I think-

913
01:05:13.348 --> 01:05:16.349
I think they took Hal down
there.

914
01:05:18.683 --> 01:05:20.254
Can you see anything?

915
01:05:20.289 --> 01:05:22.091
There are tunnels inside.

916
01:05:22.126 --> 01:05:23.752
Long ones...

917
01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:26.359
I can't see the ends.

918
01:05:26.994 --> 01:05:30.330
It must be where they go during
the day.

919
01:05:30.365 --> 01:05:32.761
There could be a whole world
down there.

920
01:05:32.796 --> 01:05:35.434
Even bigger than the island.

921
01:05:36.635 --> 01:05:40.340
Then let's keep it down there.

922
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:48.645
This is the only way out.

923
01:05:49.747 --> 01:05:52.088
Are you sure?

924
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:55.190
Unless those things can fly.

925
01:05:59.328 --> 01:06:02.065
Do you think it'll be able to
stop 'em?

926
01:06:03.563 --> 01:06:06.168
I don't know.

927
01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:21.315
Stop! Listen!

928
01:06:22.252 --> 01:06:24.516
They're not coming!

929
01:06:30.623 --> 01:06:33.129
It worked.

930
01:06:33.164 --> 01:06:35.098
It works!

931
01:06:35.633 --> 01:06:38.200
Are we sure it'll last all
night?

932
01:06:38.532 --> 01:06:40.466
I hope.

933
01:06:40.501 --> 01:06:42.468
We'll have to keep the fire
going.

934
01:06:42.503 --> 01:06:43.799
I'll take tomorrow.

935
01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:46.241
Then Lex. Then you, Kit.

936
01:06:46.276 --> 01:06:48.441
We'll keep them trapped forever.

937
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.807
I wonder if they'll start to eat
each other

938
01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:54.282
when they realize they're never
leaving.

939
01:07:12.401 --> 01:07:15.534
Are you sure you're ready?

940
01:07:18.572 --> 01:07:21.276
Then let's go home.

941
01:07:45.599 --> 01:07:47.632
The core's still intact.

942
01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:49.766
All we need is the control
element.

943
01:07:49.801 --> 01:07:51.372
No.

944
01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.539
Not like this.

945
01:07:53.574 --> 01:07:55.145
I can't go home like that.

946
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:57.609
It's time to go home!

947
01:08:22.306 --> 01:08:23.734
Tyl, that's not gonna work.

948
01:08:23.769 --> 01:08:25.439
Main power's offline.

949
01:08:26.706 --> 01:08:28.805
Then what can we do?

950
01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.708
I can do it.

951
01:08:30.743 --> 01:08:31.709
Let me try.

952
01:08:31.744 --> 01:08:33.315
One wrong wire

953
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:35.317
and he could fry the whole
computer.

954
01:08:35.352 --> 01:08:38.749
If he ever wanted to
screw us over it would be now.

955
01:08:39.554 --> 01:08:41.488
Can you get it to work?

956
01:08:41.523 --> 01:08:42.322
No!

957
01:08:42.357 --> 01:08:44.722
I'm sorry but how can we trust
him?

958
01:08:44.757 --> 01:08:46.757
Because.

959
01:08:47.661 --> 01:08:49.925
He's better than that.

960
01:08:50.796 --> 01:08:53.401
Fix it.

961
01:09:34.312 --> 01:09:36.840
Slip Gate - Come in,
this is Slip Gate Control.

962
01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:37.774
Hello?

963
01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:39.843
Gate - Who's this? Identify
yourself.

964
01:09:39.878 --> 01:09:41.845
I'm a student judge in the
Sol Invictus games.

965
01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.847
Requesting immediate transit
back to Earth

966
01:09:43.882 --> 01:09:44.781
for a report.

967
01:09:44.817 --> 01:09:47.818
Gate - Sol Invictus? That was
weeks ago.

968
01:09:47.853 --> 01:09:49.556
We thought you were all dead.

969
01:09:49.591 --> 01:09:50.887
We're not.

970
01:09:50.922 --> 01:09:51.855
Not yet.

971
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:53.021
Gate - I don't believe it.

972
01:09:53.056 --> 01:09:54.759
We need to get you back for
debrief.

973
01:09:54.794 --> 01:09:55.727
What's your name?

974
01:09:55.762 --> 01:09:56.695
My name?

975
01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:58.598
Gate - Every portal needs
a record on file

976
01:09:58.633 --> 01:10:02.338
for who authorized it.
Especially student judges.

977
01:10:02.373 --> 01:10:05.407
Give me your name.

978
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:08.740
Kit. Kit of Capricorn.

979
01:10:08.775 --> 01:10:10.841
I take full responsibility.

980
01:10:10.876 --> 01:10:13.349
I need a portal back to Earth
immediately.

981
01:10:13.384 --> 01:10:14.746
The Gate here was damaged.

982
01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:16.319
I can't get a portal up.

983
01:10:16.354 --> 01:10:17.782
I need you to open one on your
end.

984
01:10:17.817 --> 01:10:19.520
We can still activate one from
Earth.

985
01:10:19.555 --> 01:10:21.456
All I need is your planet code.

986
01:10:21.491 --> 01:10:23.557
Give it to me and we'll
have you home by nightfall.

987
01:10:23.592 --> 01:10:24.756
Can't you tell me where I am?

988
01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:26.329
We don't know where you landed.

989
01:10:26.364 --> 01:10:27.759
Now we can open a portal

990
01:10:27.794 --> 01:10:30.399
but only if we know which one to
use.

991
01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:32.599
Without that there's
no way to get you home.

992
01:10:32.634 --> 01:10:34.073
Then open all the Gates in the
system!

993
01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:35.833
Do you have any idea how many
that is?

994
01:10:35.868 --> 01:10:37.736
The resources that would waste?!

995
01:10:37.771 --> 01:10:39.309
You know we can't do that.

996
01:10:39.344 --> 01:10:40.937
What about a rescue party?

997
01:10:40.972 --> 01:10:42.510
Can you send anyone?

998
01:10:42.545 --> 01:10:43.478
We can't.

999
01:10:43.513 --> 01:10:46.778
You could be in any corner of
the galaxy.

1000
01:10:46.813 --> 01:10:49.451
What are you saying?

1001
01:10:49.486 --> 01:10:51.453
You know what I'm saying.

1002
01:10:51.488 --> 01:10:52.960
If we don't know what planet
you're on,

1003
01:10:52.984 --> 01:10:55.424
there's nothing we can do.

1004
01:10:55.459 --> 01:10:57.855
I know this is hard to hear

1005
01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:59.923
but you're not coming home.

1006
01:10:59.958 --> 01:11:01.463
I'm sorry.

1007
01:11:01.498 --> 01:11:03.465
Gate Control out...

1008
01:11:09.066 --> 01:11:11.836
We got so close...

1009
01:11:12.138 --> 01:11:15.774
Now we're even further
than when we started.

1010
01:11:15.809 --> 01:11:18.480
How could this have happened to
us?

1011
01:11:18.682 --> 01:11:20.009
I'm sorry.

1012
01:11:21.716 --> 01:11:23.749
I'm really sorry.

1013
01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:26.081
We're never going home.

1014
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:29.755
What is home?

1015
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:31.790
This isn't.

1016
01:11:32.092 --> 01:11:34.331
It could never be.

1017
01:11:40.768 --> 01:11:42.834
The fire's almost out.

1018
01:11:42.869 --> 01:11:44.869
Maybe you should put some wood
on it.

1019
01:11:44.904 --> 01:11:46.904
What's the point?

1020
01:11:47.808 --> 01:11:48.741
Where are you going?

1021
01:11:48.776 --> 01:11:51.480
Does it even matter anymore?!

1022
01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.174
My name is Tyl of Libra.

1023
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:28.176
The date?

1024
01:12:28.211 --> 01:12:30.651
I don't even know.

1025
01:12:30.686 --> 01:12:32.785
If you found this telescope then
you're

1026
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:34.490
probably stranded here too.

1027
01:12:34.525 --> 01:12:36.085
If that's the case,

1028
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.429
then I'm sorry.

1029
01:12:39.959 --> 01:12:41.563
My only advice is-

1030
01:12:45.503 --> 01:12:47.866
No...

1031
01:12:50.508 --> 01:12:53.575
Message-Eli?
Eli, I just saw your message.

1032
01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:56.171
Where are you? What happened?

1033
01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:58.173
We're so worried.

1034
01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:00.208
Your father and I
have been trying to find you

1035
01:13:00.243 --> 01:13:02.452
and no one will tell us
anything.

1036
01:13:02.487 --> 01:13:04.080
They just said there was an
accident

1037
01:13:04.115 --> 01:13:05.818
with the Slip Gates.

1038
01:13:05.853 --> 01:13:07.490
We thought you were lost...

1039
01:13:07.525 --> 01:13:10.053
I am so glad you're okay!

1040
01:13:10.088 --> 01:13:12.220
We'll never give up on finding
you.

1041
01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:15.795
Even if we have to search
every planet ourselves.

1042
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:17.863
We will find you.

1043
01:13:17.898 --> 01:13:20.536
I'll see you soon, son.

1044
01:13:20.571 --> 01:13:21.834
I love you.

1045
01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:26.135
What do you want me to do?

1046
01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:28.676
I don't know what to tell her!

1047
01:13:28.711 --> 01:13:31.107
If I send a response...

1048
01:13:32.649 --> 01:13:34.110
Wait...

1049
01:13:34.512 --> 01:13:36.519
Send a response!

1050
01:13:36.554 --> 01:13:37.817
Trace that message!

1051
01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:40.050
Point of origin.

1052
01:13:41.988 --> 01:13:43.955
Ignore!

1053
01:13:46.795 --> 01:13:48.960
You're all the way over there?

1054
01:13:58.609 --> 01:14:00.609
Oh come on!

1055
01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:11.147
Not yet you're not! Come on!

1056
01:14:46.217 --> 01:14:48.591
There you are...

1057
01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:51.286
Wait.

1058
01:14:51.321 --> 01:14:53.288
If you're Sol...

1059
01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:56.533
You can be my reference point!

1060
01:14:56.902 --> 01:14:59.635
Triangulate position.

1061
01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:02.737
Point of reference.

1062
01:15:02.772 --> 01:15:06.136
Using that star.

1063
01:15:06.171 --> 01:15:09.711
As Sol...

1064
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:19.952
Cygnus B-7.

1065
01:15:19.987 --> 01:15:22.317
Cygnus B-7!

1066
01:15:24.992 --> 01:15:27.762
Gate - Gate Control.
Come in this is Gate Control.

1067
01:15:27.797 --> 01:15:28.961
I'm a Sol contestant!

1068
01:15:28.996 --> 01:15:30.259
I need immediate transit-

1069
01:15:30.294 --> 01:15:31.964
Gate - Kid, I'm sorry.

1070
01:15:31.999 --> 01:15:33.735
But unless you've got a planet
code

1071
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:34.802
I've got nothing else-

1072
01:15:34.837 --> 01:15:36.804
Cygnus B-7!

1073
01:15:36.839 --> 01:15:37.871
We're on Cygnus B-7!

1074
01:15:37.906 --> 01:15:40.335
Gate - Cygnus B-7...

1075
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:42.337
Cygnus B-7?!

1076
01:15:42.372 --> 01:15:43.844
You're all the way out there!?

1077
01:15:44.079 --> 01:15:47.617
That's an H Class planet.
Unsafe for human habitation!

1078
01:15:47.652 --> 01:15:48.652
How did you-

1079
01:15:48.686 --> 01:15:49.949
Never mind! Listen!

1080
01:15:49.984 --> 01:15:52.083
Get to the Slip Gate as fast as
you can.

1081
01:15:52.118 --> 01:15:54.085
I just sent through the
activation command.

1082
01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.691
A portal will be up soon.

1083
01:15:55.726 --> 01:15:57.121
Wait! You gotta delay it!

1084
01:15:57.156 --> 01:15:58.628
I have to find my friends first!

1085
01:15:58.663 --> 01:16:00.861
That gate's not stable
enough to hold for long!

1086
01:16:00.896 --> 01:16:03.765
A few minutes tops and
it's gonna collapse for good!

1087
01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.229
Come home now while you still
can!

1088
01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.855
Take Adrian and get to the Slip
Gate!

1089
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:29.219
What about you?!

1090
01:16:29.254 --> 01:16:31.254
I gotta find Lex!

1091
01:16:43.202 --> 01:16:44.971
We don't have any time! You go
ahead!

1092
01:16:45.006 --> 01:16:46.973
No! We're all going home!

1093
01:16:47.008 --> 01:16:48.337
Give him to me!

1094
01:16:48.372 --> 01:16:50.372
Go!

1095
01:16:57.315 --> 01:16:59.282
Let's go! Hurry!

1096
01:17:03.156 --> 01:17:04.892
Did you hear that?

1097
01:17:04.927 --> 01:17:06.091
Don't worry about it!

1098
01:17:06.126 --> 01:17:07.224
They do that every night

1099
01:17:07.259 --> 01:17:09.292
when they're burned by the fire!

1100
01:17:09.327 --> 01:17:11.459
Should be ready in a few
minutes!

1101
01:17:12.935 --> 01:17:14.935
Wait!

1102
01:17:16.774 --> 01:17:19.071
That one didn't come from the
forest.

1103
01:17:19.106 --> 01:17:21.073
How did they-

1104
01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:23.845
Kit! You didn't-

1105
01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.715
I'm sorry!

1106
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:27.915
I didn't think we'd make it.

1107
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:29.917
It's not gonna form in time!

1108
01:17:31.954 --> 01:17:34.185
If we run we might
be able to get away from them!

1109
01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:35.483
The portal's gonna collapse!

1110
01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:37.089
It can't re-open after this!

1111
01:17:37.124 --> 01:17:39.993
We can try and fix it
later but right now we have to-

1112
01:17:41.293 --> 01:17:42.226
Run!

1113
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:43.425
No!

1114
01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:45.867
We're not running anymore!

1115
01:17:45.902 --> 01:17:46.967
You're going home.

1116
01:17:47.002 --> 01:17:47.902
What?!

1117
01:17:47.937 --> 01:17:49.101
No we can't leave you!

1118
01:17:49.136 --> 01:17:50.839
I'll buy you some time.

1119
01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:52.203
Take Adrian with you.

1120
01:17:52.238 --> 01:17:54.436
Take Adrian!

1121
01:17:55.912 --> 01:17:57.912
Take it!

1122
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:01.949
Go home.

1123
01:18:01.984 --> 01:18:03.313
What are you doing, Tyl?!

1124
01:18:03.348 --> 01:18:06.151
Have you even thought about
this?!

1125
01:18:13.061 --> 01:18:15.358
Go home, guys.

1126
01:19:47.386 --> 01:19:49.991
Here we stand,

1127
01:19:50.026 --> 01:19:52.961
on the shoulders of giants.

1128
01:19:53.263 --> 01:19:55.260
These are our words.

1129
01:19:55.295 --> 01:19:57.867
And our sacred charge.

1130
01:19:58.603 --> 01:20:01.596
Greatness is the foundation of
our world.

1131
01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:05.105
Greatness let us survive
centuries of strife.

1132
01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:07.371
Tame the physical world to our
will.

1133
01:20:07.406 --> 01:20:09.472
And spread across the stars

1134
01:20:09.507 --> 01:20:12.541
at the speed of light.

1135
01:20:12.576 --> 01:20:16.248
That same greatness may be in
you.

1136
01:20:16.283 --> 01:20:19.251
Now, it's time to find out...

1137
01:20:44.245 --> 01:20:48.643
Welcome to Sol Invictus...
