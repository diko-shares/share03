That's a funny one.
Isn't that funnier?

39
00:03:08.963 --> 00:03:10.190
It's hysterical, Manny.

40
00:03:10.263 --> 00:03:11.666
As long as we're laughing...

41
00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:13.167
we won't cry
over the box office.

42
00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:14.823
Talk about depressing.

43
00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:18.429
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around like circus ponies.

44
00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:20.031
That's depressing.

45
00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.442
I love a good chorus line.

46
00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:27.040
What's this? It's a play.

47
00:03:27.117 --> 00:03:28.607
Who wrote it, Annie?

48
00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:30.481
Some guy. Driscoll.

49
00:03:30.954 --> 00:03:32.183
Driscoll.

50
00:03:32.256 --> 00:03:34.119
From the Federal Theatre.

51
00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.558
Don't knock it, honey. At
least they got an audience.

52
00:03:38.228 --> 00:03:41.165
It'll pick up. Isn't
that right, Manny?

53
00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:46.392
It always does.

54
00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:48.397
See you tomorrow.

55
00:03:48.473 --> 00:03:52.569
The trick is to start to build right
from the back of your throat.

56
00:03:54.278 --> 00:03:56.268
Works well
out through the nose, too.

57
00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:58.145
Have you eaten today?

58
00:03:58.216 --> 00:03:59.412
Oh...

59
00:03:59.486 --> 00:04:01.786
I'm not hungry. Don't
worry about me.

60
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:03.050
Hey.

61
00:04:04.323 --> 00:04:06.086
You're all I've got.

62
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:09.788
Come on, take me to dinner.

63
00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:11.789
Okay.

64
00:04:12.163 --> 00:04:14.992
You think the kitchen
will still be open on Third?

65
00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.597
Soup and biscuits. Perfect.

66
00:04:24.475 --> 00:04:26.601
Harry, what's going on?

67
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.143
Hey, open up! We work here.
Not anymore, lady.

68
00:04:31.216 --> 00:04:34.775
It's all right for you. We haven't
had a paycheck in two weeks.

69
00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:36.511
How we gonna eat?

70
00:04:36.718 --> 00:04:39.714
They're not getting away with this!
They just did.

71
00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:42.227
Ann, it's no use.

72
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:45.223
The show, it's over. It's done.

73
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:47.294
I'm done.

74
00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:51.464
I'm leaving, Annie.

75
00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:55.229
I'm going back to Chicago.

76
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:57.700
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:00.439
I'm sorry, Annie.

78
00:05:02.418 --> 00:05:05.853
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

79
00:05:07.555 --> 00:05:09.819
You gotta think of yourself now.

80
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.685
You should try
out for that part.

81
00:05:15.428 --> 00:05:17.762
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

82
00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:21.735
Every time you reach
out for something you care about...

83
00:05:21.806 --> 00:05:24.534
fate comes
along and snatches it away.

84
00:05:25.205 --> 00:05:27.198
But not this time, Annie.

85
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:29.302
Not this time.

86
00:05:34.215 --> 00:05:36.582
Oh, hello, Mr. Weston. Oh, jeez.

87
00:05:36.784 --> 00:05:39.723
Look, miss, I told you
already, call my office.

88
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:41.726
Leave your résumé
with my secretary.

89
00:05:41.794 --> 00:05:44.851
Now, why would I want to do that when
we can talk about it in person?

90
00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:46.568
Because that's what a smart
girl would do.

91
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:49.100
But I already sent you my résumé.
You returned it unopened.

92
00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:52.190
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.

93
00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:53.929
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

94
00:05:54.002 --> 00:05:55.193
Jesus, you don't
give up, do you?

95
00:05:55.268 --> 00:05:56.826
Mr. Weston, I know
this role backwards.

96
00:05:56.902 --> 00:05:59.875
Well, that's too bad, 'cause we just
gave the part to someone else.

97
00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.344
I'm sorry, kid.
The play is cast.

98
00:06:06.447 --> 00:06:08.110
I know times are tough.

99
00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.175
You want my advice?

100
00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:13.583
Use what you got.
You're not bad-looking.

101
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.284
A girl like you doesn't
have to starve.

102
00:06:18.495 --> 00:06:20.987
There's a new place.
It just opened.

103
00:06:25.602 --> 00:06:29.198
Now listen, princess, this gig
ain't the Palace, you understand?

104
00:06:29.273 --> 00:06:32.265
Ask for Kenny K.
Tell him I sent you.

105
00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.967
Just play the date,
take the money...

106
00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:38.937
forget you was ever there.

107
00:07:09.116 --> 00:07:11.016
How much more is there?

108
00:07:11.553 --> 00:07:13.283
Another five reels.

109
00:07:13.657 --> 00:07:14.985
Lights up.

110
00:07:22.866 --> 00:07:24.229
This is it?

111
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.129
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?

112
00:07:27.202 --> 00:07:28.832
Another one of your safari
pictures?

113
00:07:28.904 --> 00:07:31.996
You promised us romantic scenes
with Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie!

114
00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:33.768
Come on, fellows,
you know the deal.

115
00:07:33.843 --> 00:07:35.439
We agreed to push
Maureen's start date...

116
00:07:35.506 --> 00:07:37.064
so she could get
her teeth fixed.

117
00:07:37.141 --> 00:07:39.978
It's not the principle
of the thing, it's the money.

118
00:07:40.048 --> 00:07:42.609
Carl, you've been in production
for over two months.

119
00:07:42.684 --> 00:07:45.343
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up the screen...

120
00:07:45.418 --> 00:07:47.319
once we get them on the ship.

121
00:07:48.088 --> 00:07:49.421
What ship?

122
00:07:49.692 --> 00:07:52.319
The one that we hired
to get to the location.

123
00:07:52.395 --> 00:07:56.192
What location? Carl! You're supposed
to be shooting on the back lot.

124
00:07:56.262 --> 00:07:57.787
Yes, I understand that.

125
00:07:57.866 --> 00:08:00.232
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...

126
00:08:00.301 --> 00:08:01.565
and I'll tell you why.

127
00:08:01.638 --> 00:08:04.470
The story has changed. The
script has been rewritten.

128
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.666
Life intervened.

129
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:10.137
I've come into possession
of a map.

130
00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:14.577
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

131
00:08:14.717 --> 00:08:17.777
A place that was thought
to exist only in myth.

132
00:08:18.087 --> 00:08:19.110
Until now.

133
00:08:19.187 --> 00:08:21.214
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

134
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:22.624
Is he asking for more money?

135
00:08:22.694 --> 00:08:25.284
He's asking us to fund
a wild goose chase.

136
00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:29.824
I'm talking about a primitive
world never before seen by man.

137
00:08:31.002 --> 00:08:33.994
The ruins of an entire
civilization.

138
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.173
The most spectacular
thing you've ever seen.

139
00:08:39.209 --> 00:08:41.703
That's where
I'll shoot my picture.

140
00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:46.081
Will there be boobies?

141
00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.548
Boobies?

142
00:08:49.022 --> 00:08:51.718
Jigglies. Jiblonkas. Bazooms.

143
00:08:51.925 --> 00:08:54.586
In my experience, people
only go to these films...

144
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.028
to observe the undraped
form of the native girls.

145
00:08:58.197 --> 00:08:59.666
What are you, an idiot?

146
00:08:59.733 --> 00:09:02.931
You think they asked De Mille
if he would waste his time on nudie shots?

147
00:09:03.005 --> 00:09:06.631
No! They respected the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

148
00:09:06.706 --> 00:09:10.167
Not that you'd know
what that means, you cheap lowlife!

149
00:09:14.343 --> 00:09:16.937
Would you step
out for a moment, Carl?

150
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.187
Zelman and Associates.

151
00:09:30.662 --> 00:09:32.425
Give me that, quick.

152
00:09:34.099 --> 00:09:36.123
You won't like it.
It's non-alcoholic.

153
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.332
Preston, you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business.

154
00:09:43.278 --> 00:09:45.870
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...

155
00:09:45.945 --> 00:09:48.916
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

156
00:09:48.984 --> 00:09:51.281
He's had a lot of near-success.

157
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.790
He's a preening self-promoter.

158
00:09:53.857 --> 00:09:57.153
An ambitious no-talent. The guy's got
"loser" written all over him.

159
00:09:57.223 --> 00:09:58.715
I understand
your disappointment...

160
00:09:58.793 --> 00:10:00.921
♪ He can't direct. He ♪
♪ doesn't have the smarts. ♪

161
00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:03.798
♪ He's washed up. ♪
♪ It's all over town. ♪

162
00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:07.295
This jumped-up
little turd's gonna bankrupt us.

163
00:10:07.369 --> 00:10:09.202
The animal footage has value.

164
00:10:09.272 --> 00:10:11.705
Sure. Universal are desperate
for stock footage.

165
00:10:11.774 --> 00:10:14.172
Then sell it! Scrap the picture.

166
00:10:16.944 --> 00:10:19.608
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

167
00:10:21.518 --> 00:10:23.111
Get him back in.

168
00:10:24.186 --> 00:10:25.743
Mr. Denham.

169
00:10:28.692 --> 00:10:30.956
I want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.

170
00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:32.154
No, Carl, you can't do this.

171
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.389
Tell them the studio pressured
us into an early departure.

172
00:10:34.462 --> 00:10:36.487
It's not ethical! What
are they gonna do, sue me?

173
00:10:36.566 --> 00:10:37.659
They can get in line.

174
00:10:37.734 --> 00:10:39.167
I'm not gonna let
them kill my film.

175
00:10:39.237 --> 00:10:42.675
You realize that none of the camera
equipment is on board?

176
00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:45.538
We have no permits, no visas.

177
00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:47.238
That's why I have you, Preston.

178
00:10:47.312 --> 00:10:49.406
We have no insurance, we have
no foreign currency.

179
00:10:49.481 --> 00:10:51.411
In fact, we have no
currency of any kind.

180
00:10:51.479 --> 00:10:52.479
He's there.

181
00:10:52.547 --> 00:10:54.377
Get in there. Who's gonna
pay for the ship?

182
00:10:54.448 --> 00:10:55.540
Get in.

183
00:10:58.353 --> 00:11:02.019
You get out of there! Come here!
Step on it! Step on it!

184
00:11:02.093 --> 00:11:05.152
Get out! You're
finished, Denham!

185
00:11:08.065 --> 00:11:11.364
Don't worry, Preston. I've had
a lot of practice at this.

186
00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.997
I'm real good at crapping
the crappers.

187
00:11:16.372 --> 00:11:18.432
Red Label, 80% proof...

188
00:11:18.507 --> 00:11:20.341
to be packed in a crate
marked "lemonade."

189
00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:21.470
You got it.

190
00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:23.915
Tell Maureen she doesn't have
six hours to put on her face.

191
00:11:23.985 --> 00:11:26.280
If she wants to be in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

192
00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:28.981
She doesn't wanna
be in this picture.

193
00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:32.750
Maureen pulled out.
She pulled out?

194
00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:34.917
Yesterday. I told you.

195
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.626
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

196
00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:39.688
That's what you told her.

197
00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:42.762
Yeah, but we're not
shooting in Singapore.

198
00:11:42.838 --> 00:11:47.136
God damn it, Preston, all you had to do
was look her in the eye and lie.

199
00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:49.934
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

200
00:11:50.012 --> 00:11:51.444
She's unavailable.

201
00:11:51.512 --> 00:11:54.344
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?

202
00:11:54.648 --> 00:11:56.707
You'll never get her
into a size four.

203
00:11:56.782 --> 00:12:00.347
You gotta get a girl that'll fit
into Maureen's costumes.

204
00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:03.920
Fay's a size four.

205
00:12:03.993 --> 00:12:07.483
Yes, she is, but she's doing
a picture with RKO.

206
00:12:09.165 --> 00:12:10.563
Cooper, huh?

207
00:12:12.368 --> 00:12:14.095
I might have known.

208
00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:16.869
You're not listening. We
got to delay the shoot.

209
00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:19.407
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

210
00:12:19.475 --> 00:12:20.908
Not an option. Carl.

211
00:12:20.977 --> 00:12:22.446
I said I'd find a girl.

212
00:12:22.514 --> 00:12:24.776
For God's sake, Preston,
think like a winner!

213
00:12:24.847 --> 00:12:27.681
Call Jack. I need
that goddamn screenplay!

214
00:12:29.553 --> 00:12:31.608
Defeat is always momentary.

215
00:13:05.557 --> 00:13:06.646
What?

216
00:14:00.948 --> 00:14:04.246
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

217
00:14:05.521 --> 00:14:06.851
Excuse me.

218
00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:11.388
Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

219
00:14:20.966 --> 00:14:22.629
Vaudeville, huh?

220
00:14:22.702 --> 00:14:25.728
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

221
00:14:25.806 --> 00:14:27.602
If you don't kill them
fast, they kill you.

222
00:14:27.674 --> 00:14:29.141
Mr. Denham...

223
00:14:30.178 --> 00:14:31.178
I want you to know...

224
00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:34.042
that I'm not in the habit
of accepting charity from strangers.

225
00:14:34.114 --> 00:14:35.979
Or, for that matter...

226
00:14:36.614 --> 00:14:38.606
taking things that don't
belong to me.

227
00:14:38.684 --> 00:14:40.586
It was obviously a terrible
misunderstanding.

228
00:14:40.654 --> 00:14:42.624
It's just that I haven't
been paid in a while.

229
00:14:42.691 --> 00:14:46.092
That's awful. Anyway, Ann...
May I call you Ann?

230
00:14:49.198 --> 00:14:52.564
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

231
00:14:55.136 --> 00:14:57.126
No, no. Oh, God, no.

232
00:14:57.204 --> 00:14:59.732
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

233
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.904
I'm not that type
of person at all.

234
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.675
What type of person are you?

235
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:06.714
I'm someone you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

236
00:15:06.782 --> 00:15:10.846
Believe me, I am on the level. No
funny business. Please sit down.

237
00:15:11.122 --> 00:15:13.487
Please. Please.

238
00:15:17.392 --> 00:15:18.484
Okay.

239
00:15:20.464 --> 00:15:22.025
Ann, I want you to imagine...

240
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:24.761
a handsome explorer
bound for the Far East.

241
00:15:24.836 --> 00:15:27.133
You're filming in the Far East?

242
00:15:27.371 --> 00:15:28.702
Singapore.

243
00:15:30.743 --> 00:15:33.541
On board ship, he meets
a mysterious girl.

244
00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:37.439
She's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.

245
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.214
And she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control...

246
00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:45.189
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.

247
00:15:45.491 --> 00:15:49.451
It's as if her whole life has
been a prelude to this moment...

248
00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:55.195
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.

249
00:15:56.265 --> 00:15:59.828
And sure enough, against her
better judgment...

250
00:16:00.104 --> 00:16:01.594
She falls in love.

251
00:16:02.306 --> 00:16:03.365
Yes.

252
00:16:03.508 --> 00:16:05.498
But she doesn't trust it.

253
00:16:05.743 --> 00:16:08.643
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.

254
00:16:10.082 --> 00:16:11.106
Uh...

255
00:16:11.183 --> 00:16:12.375
really?

256
00:16:12.549 --> 00:16:14.915
If she loves someone,
it's doomed.

257
00:16:14.985 --> 00:16:16.384
Why is that?

258
00:16:16.887 --> 00:16:19.379
Good things never
last, Mr. Denham.

259
00:16:25.097 --> 00:16:27.462
So you're interested. Good.
That's settled, then.

260
00:16:27.532 --> 00:16:30.095
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under some time pressure.

261
00:16:30.138 --> 00:16:32.570
Well, I really... Ann,
I'm telling you...

262
00:16:32.638 --> 00:16:33.972
you're perfect. Look at you.

263
00:16:34.043 --> 00:16:36.033
You're the saddest
girl I've ever met.

264
00:16:36.109 --> 00:16:40.206
You're gonna make them weep, Ann.
You're gonna break their hearts.

265
00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:43.575
See, that's where you're
wrong, Mr. Denham.

266
00:16:43.652 --> 00:16:46.246
I make people laugh,
that's what I do.

267
00:16:46.752 --> 00:16:48.879
Good luck with your picture.

268
00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:54.287
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

269
00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:55.761
I'm offering you money.

270
00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:59.494
Adventure, fame, the thrill
of a lifetime, and a long sea voyage.

271
00:16:59.568 --> 00:17:00.660
You want to read a script?

272
00:17:00.736 --> 00:17:03.798
Jack Driscoll's turning
in a draft as we speak.

273
00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:07.175
Jack Driscoll?

274
00:17:07.242 --> 00:17:08.573
Sure. Why?

275
00:17:08.644 --> 00:17:10.637
Wait. You know him?

276
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.275
No, not personally.
I've seen his plays.

277
00:17:15.385 --> 00:17:17.352
What a writer, huh? And
let me tell you, Ann...

278
00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:20.447
Jack Driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.

279
00:17:20.524 --> 00:17:21.890
He said to me, "Carl..."

280
00:17:21.961 --> 00:17:25.327
"somewhere out there is a woman
born to play this role."

281
00:17:25.397 --> 00:17:27.796
And as soon as I saw
you, I knew.

282
00:17:30.105 --> 00:17:31.435
Knew what?

283
00:17:33.436 --> 00:17:35.697
It was always going to be you.

284
00:17:47.815 --> 00:17:50.218
- How much do I owe you?
- Make it a quarter.

285
00:17:50.286 --> 00:17:51.879
Keep the change.

286
00:17:53.391 --> 00:17:55.721
Is this the moving picture ship?

287
00:17:57.325 --> 00:17:58.724
Not exactly.

288
00:17:58.825 --> 00:18:01.229
It's actually this
one over here.

289
00:18:10.776 --> 00:18:14.902
Don't let appearances deceive you.
It's much more spacious on board.

290
00:18:16.181 --> 00:18:17.840
Is this all of the equipment?
Yeah.

291
00:18:17.914 --> 00:18:19.006
This is all of it? Yeah.

292
00:18:19.082 --> 00:18:20.676
We're taking the Bell & Howell?
Yeah.

293
00:18:20.752 --> 00:18:23.451
Good. You got all the lenses?
Sure.

294
00:18:23.524 --> 00:18:25.079
Carl! Yes!

295
00:18:25.157 --> 00:18:27.523
Get it on board,
fellows, come on.

296
00:18:31.299 --> 00:18:32.321
It's bad, it's bad.

297
00:18:32.398 --> 00:18:34.299
They're on their way.
I've just had word.

298
00:18:34.366 --> 00:18:36.494
Who? Men in uniform.

299
00:18:36.569 --> 00:18:38.661
The studio called the cops.

300
00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:43.168
Englehorn! Cast off!

301
00:18:43.245 --> 00:18:45.142
Hoist up the mainsail,
raise the anchor...

302
00:18:45.212 --> 00:18:47.271
whatever the hell it is you do.
We gotta leave!

303
00:18:47.347 --> 00:18:49.007
I cannot do that.

304
00:18:49.418 --> 00:18:51.353
We are waiting on the manifest.

305
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:53.888
What? Who? English, please.

306
00:18:54.155 --> 00:18:56.020
Paperwork, Mr. Denham.

307
00:18:57.056 --> 00:18:59.721
I'll give you another $1,000
to leave now.

308
00:18:59.795 --> 00:19:02.232
You haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.

309
00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:04.462
Can we talk about this later?

310
00:19:04.533 --> 00:19:07.366
Can't you see we're
in the company of a VIP guest?

311
00:19:13.172 --> 00:19:14.468
Ma'am.

312
00:19:15.374 --> 00:19:16.739
Ann Darrow.

313
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:20.902
So you are ready for this
voyage, Miss Darrow?

314
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.276
Sure.

315
00:19:24.185 --> 00:19:25.412
Nervous?

316
00:19:28.054 --> 00:19:29.955
Nervous? No.

317
00:19:30.425 --> 00:19:33.258
Why? Should I be?

318
00:19:33.695 --> 00:19:36.424
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

319
00:19:39.098 --> 00:19:42.502
Why don't I show Miss
Darrow to her cabin?

320
00:19:43.004 --> 00:19:45.370
Wonderful idea.
Thank you, Preston.

321
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.874
Miss Darrow, if you
would just...

322
00:19:49.813 --> 00:19:53.270
Hi. My name is Preston.
Carl's assistant.

323
00:19:53.518 --> 00:19:56.383
$2,000. It's a deal.
Will you take a check?

324
00:19:56.985 --> 00:19:58.714
Do I have a choice?

325
00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.288
Please follow me.

326
00:20:01.358 --> 00:20:03.625
If there's anything that you...
Excuse me, fellows.

327
00:20:03.695 --> 00:20:07.595
If there's anything that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

328
00:20:26.085 --> 00:20:28.451
Oh, Jesus! Jack, you scared me.

329
00:20:28.521 --> 00:20:32.924
Listen. If anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me.

330
00:20:33.058 --> 00:20:35.583
Say I got depressed
and committed suicide.

331
00:20:35.662 --> 00:20:37.856
Say I stuck my head
down the toilet.

332
00:20:38.797 --> 00:20:40.858
You want one? No.
I can't stay, Carl.

333
00:20:40.935 --> 00:20:43.963
I got a rehearsal for which I am
now three hours late.

334
00:20:44.872 --> 00:20:47.205
What's this? It's the script.

335
00:20:50.346 --> 00:20:51.974
This is a script?

336
00:20:52.581 --> 00:20:54.840
Jack, this is 15 pages.

337
00:20:54.911 --> 00:20:57.538
I know, but they're good. You've got
15 good pages there, Carl.

338
00:20:57.613 --> 00:20:59.615
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

339
00:20:59.685 --> 00:21:02.086
You told me I had more time. I'm sorry.
Look, I gotta go.

340
00:21:02.155 --> 00:21:04.180
No, Jack, you can't do this to me.
I have a beginning...

341
00:21:04.256 --> 00:21:06.851
but I need a middle and an end.
I gotta have something to shoot.

342
00:21:06.926 --> 00:21:10.123
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

343
00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:17.090
All right, fine. We might
as well settle up.

344
00:21:18.604 --> 00:21:19.970
You're gonna pay me?

345
00:21:20.038 --> 00:21:21.974
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

346
00:21:24.177 --> 00:21:26.976
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

347
00:21:27.046 --> 00:21:28.877
How's $2,000 sound?

348
00:21:30.552 --> 00:21:31.986
Sounds great.

349
00:21:32.054 --> 00:21:33.782
I thought it might.

350
00:21:33.855 --> 00:21:36.378
Sounds great. Okay.

351
00:21:37.423 --> 00:21:39.254
♪ Raise the spring line! ♪

352
00:21:39.325 --> 00:21:40.919
Watch the aft!

353
00:21:49.471 --> 00:21:51.064
And voilà.

354
00:21:51.742 --> 00:21:52.935
Thanks.

355
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.802
You've written "two grand."

356
00:21:59.983 --> 00:22:03.648
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from the beginning.

357
00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:06.421
"Two thousand dollars."

358
00:22:14.331 --> 00:22:15.993
It is the 29th, isn't it?

359
00:22:16.067 --> 00:22:18.863
Oh, come on, it's the 25th.
It's the 25th.

360
00:22:19.235 --> 00:22:21.467
God, I'm sorry.
It'll just take a sec.

361
00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:23.703
Never mind, Carl. Just pay
me when you get back.

362
00:22:23.778 --> 00:22:25.139
All right.

363
00:22:38.553 --> 00:22:41.614
Your cabin is the last
on the left, Mr. Baxter.

364
00:22:41.692 --> 00:22:46.187
And may I just say how excited
we are to have you back with us, sir?

365
00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:48.059
Be a sport and lend
a hand here, would you?

366
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:50.600
Excuse me. I'm trying to...
I gotta get...

367
00:22:53.203 --> 00:22:54.396
Christ!

368
00:22:55.203 --> 00:22:57.105
Appreciate the help, fellow.

369
00:22:57.174 --> 00:22:59.301
Let me get the door for you.

370
00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:02.571
Welcome to your stateroom, sir.

371
00:23:08.119 --> 00:23:10.179
Dead slow ahead both, Mr. Hayes.

372
00:23:10.255 --> 00:23:12.191
Dead slow ahead both, Captain.

373
00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.532
Oh, Christ!

374
00:23:30.945 --> 00:23:32.347
God damn it!

375
00:23:40.756 --> 00:23:44.192
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theater.

376
00:23:47.195 --> 00:23:48.719
Oh, no! No!

377
00:23:50.166 --> 00:23:52.966
You're much better
off sticking with film.

378
00:23:53.201 --> 00:23:55.634
I don't do it
for the money, Carl.

379
00:23:57.038 --> 00:23:59.232
I happen to love the theater.

380
00:23:59.674 --> 00:24:01.164
No, you don't.

381
00:24:02.447 --> 00:24:04.436
If you really loved it...

382
00:24:04.882 --> 00:24:06.475
you would have jumped.

383
00:24:10.255 --> 00:24:12.156
You! This is your fault!

384
00:24:26.568 --> 00:24:29.731
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light, fresh straw.

385
00:24:29.805 --> 00:24:31.831
Jesus. What do you
keep down here?

386
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:34.238
Lion, tiger, hippo, you name it.

387
00:24:35.275 --> 00:24:37.007
You sell them to zoos?

388
00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:38.670
Zoo, circus.

389
00:24:38.948 --> 00:24:41.576
Skipper get big money
for rare animal.

390
00:24:41.717 --> 00:24:44.845
Careful. Camel have bad
accident on floor.

391
00:24:45.022 --> 00:24:46.683
Stain unremovable.

392
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.296
Skipper catch any wild
animal you want.

393
00:24:52.364 --> 00:24:54.261
He'll do you real good
price on white rhino.

394
00:24:54.329 --> 00:24:55.422
Choy.

395
00:24:57.734 --> 00:25:01.102
My apologies for not being
able to offer you a cabin.

396
00:25:01.171 --> 00:25:03.972
Have you found an enclosure
to your taste?

397
00:25:05.175 --> 00:25:06.508
Spoiled for choice.

398
00:25:06.578 --> 00:25:09.306
What are you, Mr. Driscoll?
A lion?

399
00:25:10.381 --> 00:25:12.112
Or a chimpanzee?

400
00:25:13.586 --> 00:25:15.210
I'll take this one.

401
00:25:28.167 --> 00:25:29.829
I told you to lock it up.

402
00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:33.429
Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said...
Lumpy doesn't give the orders!

403
00:25:33.508 --> 00:25:36.568
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?

404
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.678
Get them out of here.

405
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.685
Compliments of the chef. Okay.

406
00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:27.086
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

407
00:26:27.664 --> 00:26:29.995
Lamb's brains in walnut sauce.

408
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:36.831
Jimmy.

409
00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:39.007
You run those ropes
up on deck like I told you?

410
00:26:39.074 --> 00:26:41.066
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

411
00:26:41.376 --> 00:26:45.279
How about you return
Mr. Driscoll's pen first?

412
00:26:53.091 --> 00:26:54.953
He don't mean no harm.

413
00:26:55.958 --> 00:26:56.959
Thanks.

414
00:26:57.026 --> 00:26:58.789
I'll keep him out of your way.
It's okay.

415
00:26:58.861 --> 00:27:01.387
It's just that he likes
it down here.

416
00:27:01.464 --> 00:27:04.060
It's where I found
him four years ago.

417
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.996
Stowed away in one of them
back cages.

418
00:27:08.273 --> 00:27:10.707
His arm was broken
in two places.

419
00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:14.775
He was wilder than half
the animals in here.

420
00:27:15.678 --> 00:27:18.274
Still won't tell me
where he came from.

421
00:27:19.449 --> 00:27:21.579
But it wasn't anyplace good.

422
00:27:24.257 --> 00:27:26.248
You got to straighten up.

423
00:27:26.525 --> 00:27:27.686
Jimmy.

424
00:27:28.493 --> 00:27:31.487
You don't want to be on this
ship the rest of your life.

425
00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:33.928
Yes, I do. No, you don't, Jimmy.

426
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.495
You got to be smart.
Get yourself educated.

427
00:27:36.566 --> 00:27:38.498
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!

428
00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:40.695
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do. Look.

429
00:27:40.837 --> 00:27:42.329
I've been reading.

430
00:27:45.276 --> 00:27:46.971
Where'd you get this?

431
00:27:47.313 --> 00:27:48.313
I borrowed it.

432
00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.751
On long-term loan.

433
00:27:54.252 --> 00:27:55.683
Look at this. Look, look.

434
00:27:55.752 --> 00:27:59.019
"Adventures on a tramp steamer." See?
Just like us.

435
00:28:06.098 --> 00:28:08.726
It's so nice to meet
you, Mr. Driscoll.

436
00:28:09.435 --> 00:28:12.305
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.

437
00:28:16.275 --> 00:28:19.403
Hello, Mr. Driscoll.
It's so nice to meet you.

438
00:28:19.545 --> 00:28:22.449
Actually, I'm quite
familiar with your work.

439
00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:24.743
I'm a huge fan.

440
00:28:24.818 --> 00:28:26.754
I've read everything
you've ever written.

441
00:28:26.822 --> 00:28:28.289
No, too much.

442
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:32.257
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialogue.

443
00:28:32.997 --> 00:28:34.326
Seagulls.

444
00:28:35.364 --> 00:28:37.491
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.

445
00:28:37.566 --> 00:28:38.725
I don't care, Mike.

446
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.201
You're the sound recordist.
Make it work.

447
00:28:42.672 --> 00:28:45.469
Ann! Come on in. Let me
introduce you to the crew.

448
00:28:45.541 --> 00:28:47.737
This is Herb, the cameraman.

449
00:28:48.311 --> 00:28:51.007
Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
Likewise.

450
00:28:51.081 --> 00:28:53.244
May I say what a lovely dress?

451
00:28:53.318 --> 00:28:56.216
Oh, this old thing?
I just threw it on.

452
00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.245
Isn't
that one of Maureen's costumes?

453
00:28:59.621 --> 00:29:03.355
Now, what does a girl have to do
around here to get some breakfast?

454
00:29:03.428 --> 00:29:05.452
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

455
00:29:05.529 --> 00:29:08.987
Fancy my porridge à la walnuts?

456
00:29:13.107 --> 00:29:15.727
Oh, Ann, I don't
believe you've met...

457
00:29:18.139 --> 00:29:19.197
Ann?

458
00:29:19.674 --> 00:29:22.839
That's all right, Mr. Denham.
I know who this is.

459
00:29:28.118 --> 00:29:31.748
Thrilled to meet you. It's an honor
to be a part of this.

460
00:29:32.991 --> 00:29:34.386
Gee, thanks.

461
00:29:34.989 --> 00:29:37.892
Actually, I'm quite
familiar with your work.

462
00:29:38.328 --> 00:29:39.521
Really?

463
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.390
Yes, and what I most admire...

464
00:29:42.467 --> 00:29:46.094
is the way you've captured
the voice of the common people.

465
00:29:47.339 --> 00:29:49.135
Well, that's my job.

466
00:29:52.043 --> 00:29:54.373
I'm sure you've heard this
before, Mr. Driscoll...

467
00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:55.911
if you don't mind me saying...

468
00:29:55.979 --> 00:29:59.040
but you don't look
at all like your photograph.

469
00:30:04.189 --> 00:30:05.884
Excuse me. Wait a minute, Ann...

470
00:30:05.957 --> 00:30:08.757
He's so much younger in person.
And much better-looking.

471
00:30:08.829 --> 00:30:10.456
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

472
00:30:10.532 --> 00:30:12.693
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be...

473
00:30:12.768 --> 00:30:15.563
one of those self-obsessed
literary types.

474
00:30:16.067 --> 00:30:17.467
I'm sorry, I'm not...
You know...

475
00:30:17.538 --> 00:30:21.269
the tweedy twerp with his nose
in his book and his head up his a...

476
00:30:25.479 --> 00:30:28.177
It's nice to meet you,
too, Miss Darrow.

477
00:30:42.063 --> 00:30:43.464
Good Christ!

478
00:31:09.957 --> 00:31:11.928
She's standing at the railing.

479
00:31:11.994 --> 00:31:13.518
She doesn't know it yet...

480
00:31:14.759 --> 00:31:18.254
But they are sailing towards disaster.
You got that?

481
00:31:18.432 --> 00:31:20.161
Okay, so she turns...

482
00:31:21.469 --> 00:31:23.370
the first mate
is staggering towards her.

483
00:31:24.705 --> 00:31:27.301
There's a knife sticking
out of his back.

484
00:31:27.376 --> 00:31:30.311
Wait a sec. We're killing
off the first mate?

485
00:31:30.847 --> 00:31:33.044
That's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.

486
00:31:33.118 --> 00:31:35.948
Come on, Jack. It
was an honest mistake.

487
00:31:36.017 --> 00:31:38.577
Ann is nearsighted. It could
have happened to anyone.

488
00:31:38.654 --> 00:31:40.246
I was joking, Carl.

489
00:31:40.322 --> 00:31:43.623
The point is, she's horrified.
She has to look away.

490
00:31:46.329 --> 00:31:48.457
And that's when she sees it.

491
00:31:50.635 --> 00:31:52.003
Sees what?

492
00:31:53.274 --> 00:31:54.364
What?

493
00:31:59.912 --> 00:32:01.277
The island.

494
00:32:04.983 --> 00:32:09.387
We're filming on an island now?
When did this happen?

495
00:32:10.123 --> 00:32:12.558
Jack, keep your voice down.

496
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:15.618
I don't want the crew
getting spooked.

497
00:32:16.194 --> 00:32:19.222
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

498
00:32:19.299 --> 00:32:21.325
All right. It has
a local name...

499
00:32:21.402 --> 00:32:23.929
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

500
00:32:24.006 --> 00:32:26.698
They call it Skull Island.

501
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.501
Did you get that?

502
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:30.640
What's wrong with this place?

503
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:33.443
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.

504
00:32:33.648 --> 00:32:37.011
Because, technically, it
hasn't been discovered yet.

505
00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:41.385
Okay. All right.

506
00:32:43.621 --> 00:32:45.852
So we arrive at this place.

507
00:32:46.457 --> 00:32:47.651
S...

508
00:32:48.294 --> 00:32:49.487
K...

509
00:32:50.529 --> 00:32:51.897
U...

510
00:32:52.901 --> 00:32:54.095
I...

511
00:32:55.598 --> 00:32:56.862
I...

512
00:33:02.342 --> 00:33:03.707
Island.

513
00:33:08.017 --> 00:33:11.110
All right, everyone, from the top!
And action!

514
00:33:12.686 --> 00:33:16.348
I think this is awfully exciting!
I've never been on a ship before.

515
00:33:16.422 --> 00:33:19.019
And I've never
been on one with a woman before.

516
00:33:19.095 --> 00:33:22.552
I guess you don't think much
of women on ships, do you?

517
00:33:22.933 --> 00:33:24.591
No, they're a nuisance.

518
00:33:24.664 --> 00:33:28.331
Well, I'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.

519
00:33:36.611 --> 00:33:37.669
Cut!

520
00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.147
It's great.

521
00:33:40.282 --> 00:33:44.514
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

522
00:33:44.587 --> 00:33:47.490
That was very natural.
I felt moved.

523
00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:51.118
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some flow now, huh?

524
00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:53.029
It was pure effluence.

525
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.856
I beefed up the banter.

526
00:33:54.928 --> 00:33:57.060
Try to resist that impulse.

527
00:33:57.667 --> 00:33:59.364
It's just a little bit
of humor, bud.

528
00:33:59.438 --> 00:34:01.905
What are you, a Bolshevik
or something?

529
00:34:01.974 --> 00:34:03.170
Actors.

530
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.609
Travel the world, but all they ever
see is a mirror.

531
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:21.420
Good legs.

532
00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:25.685
Sea legs. Well, you
know, sea legs.

533
00:34:28.267 --> 00:34:29.291
Yeah.

534
00:34:29.368 --> 00:34:32.996
Not that you don't have good legs.
Just making conversation.

535
00:34:33.072 --> 00:34:35.367
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

536
00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:39.863
About the scene today
with you and Bruce...

537
00:34:39.941 --> 00:34:41.774
I know it wasn't
what you wrote...

538
00:34:41.845 --> 00:34:45.872
but Mr. Baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman...

539
00:34:46.517 --> 00:34:48.181
he must ignore her.

540
00:34:48.255 --> 00:34:51.120
And if things turn
really hostile, then...

541
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:53.187
No?

542
00:34:53.261 --> 00:34:54.984
Interesting theory.

543
00:34:55.693 --> 00:34:57.718
I know. I should have...

544
00:34:57.862 --> 00:35:00.092
It wasn't what I had
intended, but...

545
00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:01.690
I'm sorry. I was...

546
00:35:01.767 --> 00:35:03.759
And you made it your own.

547
00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:06.228
I was nervous.

548
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.068
It was funny, actually.
You were funny.

549
00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:12.311
Please don't say another word.
Good night.

550
00:35:12.382 --> 00:35:13.779
Miss Darrow.

551
00:35:19.422 --> 00:35:21.616
You don't have to be nervous.

552
00:36:32.163 --> 00:36:33.496
Thank you.

553
00:36:34.399 --> 00:36:36.023
Let's take it...

554
00:36:36.132 --> 00:36:38.432
Would you please... We're
trying to shoot a scene.

555
00:36:38.504 --> 00:36:40.128
Okay. Thank you.

556
00:36:40.538 --> 00:36:41.664
Okay, again.

557
00:36:56.221 --> 00:36:58.418
We're close. Turn southwest.

558
00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:02.054
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

559
00:37:03.997 --> 00:37:06.522
It takes us way
outside the shipping lanes.

560
00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:09.091
I won't sail blind
in these waters.

561
00:37:10.136 --> 00:37:12.369
I'll make it worth your while.

562
00:37:13.677 --> 00:37:15.698
There's nothing out there.

563
00:37:16.409 --> 00:37:18.843
Well, then
you've nothing to lose.

564
00:37:30.892 --> 00:37:34.851
If someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for Singapore...

565
00:37:36.327 --> 00:37:38.056
what would you say?

566
00:37:38.163 --> 00:37:40.926
I would say they're
full of it, Mr. Hayes.

567
00:37:42.901 --> 00:37:45.426
Well, we turned
southwest last night.

568
00:37:45.638 --> 00:37:47.300
Gentlemen, please.

569
00:37:48.744 --> 00:37:51.234
We're not looking for trouble.
No.

570
00:37:52.582 --> 00:37:54.978
You're looking
for something else.

571
00:37:58.351 --> 00:37:59.752
Yes, we are.

572
00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.790
We're going to find
Skull Island.

573
00:38:04.391 --> 00:38:07.225
Find it, film it,
and show it to the world.

574
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:11.996
For 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.

575
00:38:12.402 --> 00:38:14.596
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

576
00:38:16.903 --> 00:38:18.533
What do you mean?

577
00:38:19.274 --> 00:38:21.869
Seven years ago, me and Mr. Hayes
were working our passage...

578
00:38:21.943 --> 00:38:23.503
on a Norwegian bark.

579
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.411
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

580
00:38:26.683 --> 00:38:28.516
He'd been drifting for days.

581
00:38:28.586 --> 00:38:31.986
His ship had run aground
on an island way west of Sumatra.

582
00:38:32.056 --> 00:38:35.512
An island hidden in fog.

583
00:38:37.293 --> 00:38:39.559
He spoke of a huge wall...

584
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.596
built so long ago...

585
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.124
no one knew who'd made it.

586
00:38:45.368 --> 00:38:48.272
A wall 100 foot high...

587
00:38:48.541 --> 00:38:51.374
as strong today
as it was ages ago.

588
00:38:53.145 --> 00:38:55.135
Why'd they build the wall?

589
00:38:59.586 --> 00:39:03.249
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...

590
00:39:03.691 --> 00:39:05.782
neither beast nor man...

591
00:39:06.293 --> 00:39:09.559
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

592
00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:11.958
A lion or a tiger.

593
00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:15.230
A man-eater. That's how all these
stories start.

594
00:39:15.302 --> 00:39:17.094
What else did he say?

595
00:39:17.433 --> 00:39:18.560
Nothing.

596
00:39:18.636 --> 00:39:21.399
We found him the next morning.
He'd stuck a knife through his heart.

597
00:39:21.472 --> 00:39:22.735
Mmm-hmm.

598
00:39:22.906 --> 00:39:25.965
Sorry, fellows. You'll have
to do better than that.

599
00:39:27.211 --> 00:39:29.477
Monsters belong in B movies.

600
00:39:29.548 --> 00:39:31.572
If you find this place...

601
00:39:32.084 --> 00:39:35.519
if you go ashore with your friends
and your cameras...

602
00:39:36.688 --> 00:39:38.384
you won't come back.

603
00:39:39.358 --> 00:39:41.883
Just as long as you
understand that.

604
00:41:01.742 --> 00:41:04.609
How long do you expect
us to stay out here?

605
00:41:10.221 --> 00:41:12.452
You're writing a stage comedy?

606
00:41:12.591 --> 00:41:14.490
I'm writing it for you.

607
00:41:16.658 --> 00:41:18.525
Why would you do that?

608
00:41:19.463 --> 00:41:22.329
Why would I write a play for you?
Yes.

609
00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:25.594
Isn't it obvious?

610
00:41:28.339 --> 00:41:29.672
Not to me.

611
00:41:33.514 --> 00:41:34.706
Well...

612
00:41:36.246 --> 00:41:38.043
it's in the subtext.

613
00:41:40.785 --> 00:41:43.015
I guess I must have missed it.

614
00:41:48.126 --> 00:41:49.926
It's not about words.

615
00:42:33.077 --> 00:42:35.067
Message for you, Captain.

616
00:42:53.461 --> 00:42:55.088
What's going on?

617
00:42:55.863 --> 00:42:58.697
Hayes, why
are we changing course?

618
00:43:00.269 --> 00:43:02.533
Englehorn, you can't just...
Outside.

619
00:43:06.609 --> 00:43:09.205
There's a warrant
out for your arrest.

620
00:43:09.546 --> 00:43:11.173
Did you know that?

621
00:43:13.618 --> 00:43:16.245
I've been ordered
to divert to Rangoon.

622
00:43:20.424 --> 00:43:23.724
Another week. I haven't
got a film yet.

623
00:43:25.027 --> 00:43:27.793
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

624
00:43:27.865 --> 00:43:31.130
No, Denham. You risked
everything I have.

625
00:43:33.038 --> 00:43:34.300
What do you want?

626
00:43:34.371 --> 00:43:36.635
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

627
00:43:36.706 --> 00:43:38.641
I want you off my ship.

628
00:43:41.178 --> 00:43:43.704
Set a course
for Rangoon, Mr. Hayes.

629
00:43:50.324 --> 00:43:51.791
I'm finished.

630
00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.123
It's over for me, Jack.

631
00:43:56.861 --> 00:43:59.355
How'd you think this
would end, Carl?

632
00:44:15.082 --> 00:44:18.514
Check our position.
Use the stars.

633
00:44:32.165 --> 00:44:34.293
There are no stars, Captain.

634
00:44:36.735 --> 00:44:38.135
What is that?

635
00:44:40.107 --> 00:44:42.198
What? That.

636
00:44:46.179 --> 00:44:47.841
That right there.

637
00:44:48.882 --> 00:44:51.648
I don't know. What is it?
A coffee stain?

638
00:46:29.989 --> 00:46:33.825
Station the forward lookout and get
me the depth by lead line.

639
00:46:34.127 --> 00:46:35.594
Aye, Captain.

640
00:46:46.906 --> 00:46:49.034
30 fathoms, no bottom!

641
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.850
Reduce speed, steerage way only.

642
00:46:54.615 --> 00:46:56.480
Dead slow ahead, both.

643
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:01.512
You should stop the ship.

644
00:47:02.892 --> 00:47:04.686
15 degrees port.

645
00:47:07.563 --> 00:47:09.292
We're getting
out of here, Mr. Hayes.

646
00:47:09.365 --> 00:47:11.492
We'll find clear conditions.

647
00:47:12.167 --> 00:47:13.693
We have seabed!

648
00:47:19.442 --> 00:47:20.932
25 fathoms!

649
00:47:22.813 --> 00:47:24.279
We're shallowing!

650
00:47:24.346 --> 00:47:25.712
20 degrees starboard!

651
00:47:25.782 --> 00:47:27.842
Captain, you don't know where
the hell you're going!

652
00:47:27.919 --> 00:47:29.546
Get me another reading!

653
00:47:32.791 --> 00:47:34.380
Another reading!

654
00:47:36.928 --> 00:47:38.652
22 fathoms!

655
00:47:40.194 --> 00:47:42.252
Douse the lights. Aye, Captain.

656
00:47:54.277 --> 00:47:55.676
10 fathoms!

657
00:48:07.255 --> 00:48:10.057
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

658
00:48:27.311 --> 00:48:28.803
Stop engines!

659
00:49:32.114 --> 00:49:33.912
Give me some power!
Half astern both.

660
00:49:33.983 --> 00:49:36.074
Half astern both, Captain!

661
00:49:40.653 --> 00:49:41.848
Rocks!

662
00:49:44.958 --> 00:49:46.119
Rocks!

663
00:49:50.699 --> 00:49:52.859
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

664
00:49:53.369 --> 00:49:55.733
To port! Rocks everywhere!

665
00:49:55.906 --> 00:49:57.495
Take the wheel, Hayes.

666
00:50:14.657 --> 00:50:15.885
Hang on!

667
00:50:39.351 --> 00:50:40.716
Full ahead!

668
00:50:46.524 --> 00:50:48.428
Rocks to port, Captain!

669
00:50:49.397 --> 00:50:52.163
- Turn, Captain!
- Starboard, starboard!

670
00:51:11.617 --> 00:51:12.877
Ah!

671
00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:21.183
Shore up that breach!

672
00:52:21.259 --> 00:52:24.524
Get me more men down here now!
Come on, move, move!

673
00:52:26.565 --> 00:52:28.862
Hayes! She's taken a pounding!

674
00:52:31.137 --> 00:52:32.572
What about the prop?

675
00:52:32.638 --> 00:52:34.831
The shaft's not bent,
as far as we can tell.

676
00:52:34.905 --> 00:52:37.136
But she struck hard
against the rock!

677
00:52:38.143 --> 00:52:39.368
Captain!

678
00:52:40.042 --> 00:52:41.806
Better come up quick!

679
00:52:43.679 --> 00:52:45.074
Right there!

680
00:52:59.896 --> 00:53:01.990
Want me to bring them back?

681
00:53:02.633 --> 00:53:04.328
I don't give a damn
about Carl Denham.

682
00:53:04.401 --> 00:53:07.892
I want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide!

683
00:53:07.971 --> 00:53:09.600
Come on, move it.

684
00:53:10.776 --> 00:53:12.766
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.

685
00:53:20.185 --> 00:53:22.280
Can you believe this, Jack?

686
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:27.455
We've got our picture.

687
00:54:25.082 --> 00:54:27.781
Why does Marlow keep
going up the river?

688
00:54:29.155 --> 00:54:31.148
Why doesn't he turn back?

689
00:54:33.594 --> 00:54:36.427
There's a part of him
that wants to, Jimmy.

690
00:54:37.765 --> 00:54:40.929
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

691
00:54:42.738 --> 00:54:44.829
But there's another part...

692
00:54:45.972 --> 00:54:47.702
that needs to know.

693
00:54:50.948 --> 00:54:53.781
To defeat the thing
which makes him afraid.

694
00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:58.951
"We could not understand
because we were too far..."

695
00:54:59.823 --> 00:55:01.018
<i>"and could not remember..."</i>

696
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:04.618
<i>"because we were traveling
in the night of first ages..."</i>

697
00:55:05.459 --> 00:55:07.760
<i>"of those ages that are gone..."</i>

698
00:55:08.967 --> 00:55:11.663
<i>"leaving hardly a sign,
and no memories."</i>

699
00:55:14.539 --> 00:55:15.765
<i>"We are accustomed to look..."</i>

700
00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.004
<i>"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster..."</i>

701
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:22.971
<i>"but there...</i>

702
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:28.115
<i>"there you could look at a thing
monstrous and free. ".</i>

703
00:55:38.132 --> 00:55:40.362
It's not an adventure story...

704
00:55:40.935 --> 00:55:42.563
is it, Mr. Hayes?

705
00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:45.900
No, Jimmy.

706
00:55:47.007 --> 00:55:48.407
It's not.

707
00:56:10.898 --> 00:56:13.297
It's deserted. Of
course it's deserted.

708
00:56:13.366 --> 00:56:16.802
Use your eyes, Preston.
The place is a ruin.

709
00:56:18.238 --> 00:56:21.037
Nobody's lived here
for hundreds of years.

710
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.412
Mr. Denham, I think
we should go back.

711
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:39.215
I will handle this.

712
00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:46.287
Look. Chocolate.

713
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:49.259
You like chocolate?

714
00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:53.730
It's good to eat.

715
00:57:56.072 --> 00:57:57.335
You want?

716
00:58:03.348 --> 00:58:04.575
Take it.

717
00:58:12.326 --> 00:58:14.691
Here, put it in your hand
and take it.

718
00:58:20.767 --> 00:58:23.201
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.

719
00:58:23.268 --> 00:58:25.564
She doesn't want the chocolate.

720
00:58:27.539 --> 00:58:28.769
Aah!

721
00:58:50.801 --> 00:58:52.166
All right!

722
00:58:52.538 --> 00:58:55.025
Just a bunch of women
and old folks!

723
00:58:56.839 --> 00:58:58.467
They're harmless!

724
01:00:20.192 --> 01:00:21.250
Ann!

725
01:01:48.752 --> 01:01:49.844
Jack.

726
01:02:04.068 --> 01:02:05.464
Seen enough?

727
01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:14.971
Lighten the ship!

728
01:02:15.479 --> 01:02:19.145
Anything that's not bolted
down goes overboard!

729
01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:22.979
Just heave it!

730
01:02:23.523 --> 01:02:24.749
We got away.

731
01:02:24.823 --> 01:02:26.552
We gotta be grateful
for that, gentlemen.

732
01:02:26.624 --> 01:02:30.393
What about Mike? He didn't get away!
He's still there!

733
01:02:31.098 --> 01:02:34.396
Mike died doing what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing.

734
01:02:34.468 --> 01:02:38.529
And I'll tell you something else. I'm
gonna finish this film for Mike!

735
01:02:44.973 --> 01:02:46.601
I'll finish it...

736
01:02:48.512 --> 01:02:50.813
and I'll donate the proceeds...

737
01:02:51.517 --> 01:02:53.315
to his wife and kids.

738
01:02:53.754 --> 01:02:57.311
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

739
01:02:58.156 --> 01:02:59.523
Hear, hear!

740
01:03:38.034 --> 01:03:40.433
Chuck everything
except for the potatoes!

741
01:03:45.973 --> 01:03:48.808
What's wrong now?
Excuse me, Shakespeare.

742
01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:51.679
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

743
01:04:02.929 --> 01:04:06.325
Drop those spare cables overboard!
Go on, just chuck it!

744
01:04:24.745 --> 01:04:25.905
Where's Ann? What?

745
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:27.141
Where's Ann?

746
01:04:32.523 --> 01:04:33.524
Ann!

747
01:04:53.312 --> 01:04:54.641
She's free!

748
01:05:00.988 --> 01:05:03.580
Full ahead, both engines!

749
01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:12.299
Ann!

750
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:37.791
No! Stop! Turn back!

751
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:40.355
Stop!

752
01:05:42.265 --> 01:05:44.063
We have to turn back.

753
01:05:44.267 --> 01:05:45.926
They've taken Ann.

754
01:05:58.349 --> 01:06:01.437
Kong! Kong! Kong!

755
01:06:43.627 --> 01:06:47.526
All hands going ashore!
Report to stations!

756
01:06:48.831 --> 01:06:51.269
Jump to it! Jump
to it, gentlemen!

757
01:06:54.941 --> 01:06:56.667
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!

758
01:07:03.985 --> 01:07:05.742
Come on, move it!

759
01:07:22.769 --> 01:07:24.432
Pull harder!

760
01:07:25.769 --> 01:07:27.670
Row! Row!

761
01:07:27.873 --> 01:07:29.071
Come on!

762
01:08:15.887 --> 01:08:17.015
Kong.

763
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:41.207
Spread out! Find her!

764
01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.387
Miss Darrow!

765
01:10:51.588 --> 01:10:54.388
Check up there, Jimmy!
Everybody stay together!

766
01:10:57.828 --> 01:10:58.855
Ann!

767
01:11:01.001 --> 01:11:02.760
She's here somewhere!

768
01:11:07.468 --> 01:11:09.300
What in God's name was that?

769
01:11:15.675 --> 01:11:17.269
Behind the wall!

770
01:11:18.011 --> 01:11:19.604
Behind the wall!

771
01:12:11.273 --> 01:12:12.639
She's gone!

772
01:12:23.619 --> 01:12:25.381
Carl, what is it?

773
01:12:32.028 --> 01:12:33.690
You saw something.

774
01:12:40.872 --> 01:12:43.665
You can take Hayes
and 15 others.

775
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:47.133
I'll put a guard on the gate
until you return.

776
01:12:47.206 --> 01:12:49.697
The rest of you
stay with the ship.

777
01:12:49.808 --> 01:12:50.902
Choy!

778
01:12:52.682 --> 01:12:54.238
Not you, Jimmy.

779
01:12:54.349 --> 01:12:56.474
Come on, Mr. Hayes.
Look at them.

780
01:12:56.549 --> 01:12:58.313
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

781
01:12:58.385 --> 01:12:59.716
Stay here.

782
01:13:00.222 --> 01:13:02.691
Miss Darrow needs me! No!

783
01:13:07.559 --> 01:13:09.926
Bring the tripod
and all of the film stock.

784
01:13:09.996 --> 01:13:12.433
You wanna go
with the 6-inch lens?

785
01:13:12.903 --> 01:13:15.303
The wide-angle
will do just fine.

786
01:13:21.313 --> 01:13:24.245
You got guns. You got food.
You got the ammo.

787
01:13:24.714 --> 01:13:26.509
And you got 24 hours!

788
01:13:26.981 --> 01:13:28.415
24 hours?

789
01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:30.813
This time tomorrow,
we haul anchor.

790
01:13:54.281 --> 01:13:55.802
♪ Miss Darrow! ♪

791
01:13:58.181 --> 01:13:59.310

794
01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:33.495
What is it?

795
01:14:43.257 --> 01:14:44.540
Fire!

796
01:14:46.296 --> 01:14:47.636
Cut it out.

797
01:14:48.846 --> 01:14:50.349
Hold your fire.

798
01:14:50.638 --> 01:14:52.523
Hold your fire!

799
01:15:22.824 --> 01:15:25.712
Stay down, damn it. Stay down.

800
01:15:40.353 --> 01:15:43.969
Come on. Come on. Come on.

801
01:16:15.672 --> 01:16:17.633
Good shooting, Mr. Hayes.

802
01:16:21.799 --> 01:16:24.086
Aren't these things
supposed to be extinct?

803
01:16:24.336 --> 01:16:25.754
They are now.

804
01:16:31.516 --> 01:16:34.100
What the hell kind
of a place is this?

805
01:16:49.478 --> 01:16:50.877
Miss Darrow!

806
01:16:55.586 --> 01:16:56.642
Ann!

807
01:18:12.197 --> 01:18:13.200
No!

808
01:18:30.918 --> 01:18:33.116
Ann! Sailor: Miss Darrow!

809
01:18:41.732 --> 01:18:42.788
Ann!

810
01:19:30.244 --> 01:19:32.646
Christ, it's a bleeding
boneyard!

811
01:19:34.051 --> 01:19:36.518
They've been ripped
limb from limb.

812
01:19:38.353 --> 01:19:40.790
Ann! Ann!

813
01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.301
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes.
Pretend you didn't see me.

814
01:19:56.373 --> 01:19:58.364
Jesus, Jimmy. Hey, I need that!

815
01:19:58.442 --> 01:19:59.672
I'm not giving you a gun!

816
01:19:59.746 --> 01:20:01.772
You were younger than me
when they gave you one!

817
01:20:01.849 --> 01:20:05.407
I was in the army. I was trained.
I had a drill sergeant.

818
01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:09.012
I wanna help bring her back.

819
01:20:16.863 --> 01:20:18.831
Don't make me regret it.

820
01:20:46.159 --> 01:20:48.150
Conserve your ammunition!

821
01:20:57.506 --> 01:20:58.997
I'm knackered.

822
01:21:01.312 --> 01:21:03.368
- I can't breathe.
- I need a breather.

823
01:21:03.443 --> 01:21:04.909
Fellows, we don't
have time for this.

824
01:21:04.977 --> 01:21:07.443
We've lost too much ground already.
Come on, get up!

825
01:21:07.512 --> 01:21:10.951
They're not about to quit on you.
Cut them some slack.

826
01:21:11.085 --> 01:21:13.418
All right, you got five minutes!

827
01:21:13.655 --> 01:21:15.588
Everybody stay in sight.

828
01:21:19.595 --> 01:21:23.032
Over here. I'm gonna get
a wide shot of the valley.

829
01:21:53.266 --> 01:21:54.630
Bloody Nora!

830
01:22:01.775 --> 01:22:04.005
Is that what took Miss Darrow?

831
01:22:07.577 --> 01:22:11.710
There's only one creature capable
of leaving a footprint that size.

832
01:22:18.157 --> 01:22:20.058
The abominable snowman.

833
01:22:21.662 --> 01:22:24.357
Yeah, a snowman. We dead meat.

834
01:22:25.064 --> 01:22:27.464
It's got to be
what, 20, 25 feet?

835
01:22:29.568 --> 01:22:31.003
Carl saw it.

836
01:22:32.407 --> 01:22:33.899
Let's ask him.

837
01:22:36.011 --> 01:22:37.204
Denham!

838
01:22:39.781 --> 01:22:41.045
Where'd he go?

839
01:23:01.269 --> 01:23:03.033
Walk forward, Bruce.

840
01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:05.365
What? You're the star
of this picture.

841
01:23:05.437 --> 01:23:08.497
Get into character and head
toward the animals.

842
01:23:14.649 --> 01:23:17.243
What the hell kind
of a place is this?

843
01:23:27.462 --> 01:23:29.793
Are you sure about this, Denham?

844
01:23:30.298 --> 01:23:32.359
Don't we have a stand-in
for this type of thing?

845
01:23:32.435 --> 01:23:35.369
I need you in the shot, or people
will say they're fake.

846
01:23:35.437 --> 01:23:37.632
Nobody's gonna think
these are fake.

847
01:23:46.316 --> 01:23:48.306
You're making them nervous.
No sudden movements.

848
01:23:48.384 --> 01:23:49.682
I'm not moving.

849
01:23:55.459 --> 01:23:57.789
Mother of God.

850
01:24:19.751 --> 01:24:21.119
What's this?

851
01:24:47.345 --> 01:24:48.810
What is it? What is it?
Where's Carl?

852
01:24:48.877 --> 01:24:51.678
Carl? He's up there, filming.

853
01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:03.529
Bugger this!

854
01:25:10.936 --> 01:25:12.735
Run, Jack!

855
01:25:15.542 --> 01:25:18.066
Holy Christ. Go, Jimmy, run!

856
01:25:18.977 --> 01:25:20.470
Run, run, run!

857
01:25:27.356 --> 01:25:28.946
Let go! I'm not
leaving the camera!

858
01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.320
Let go, you idiot!

859
01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:32.224
Carl, run!

860
01:25:45.674 --> 01:25:46.936
Get down.

861
01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:48.800
Look out!

862
01:26:39.094 --> 01:26:40.620
Coming through!

863
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:45.953
No!

864
01:28:29.044 --> 01:28:31.775
Carl! Carl!

865
01:28:34.951 --> 01:28:37.476
Get up! Come on. Come on.

866
01:28:52.338 --> 01:28:55.000
Mr. Denham! Mr. Denham!

867
01:28:55.707 --> 01:28:58.302
Herb! Herb, come on!

868
01:28:58.377 --> 01:29:00.106
Take the tripod!

869
01:29:00.347 --> 01:29:01.576
Come on!

870
01:29:02.783 --> 01:29:05.341
I'm pulling you up!
Hold on to your end!

871
01:29:05.417 --> 01:29:06.441
Go!

872
01:29:06.517 --> 01:29:08.212
No, I'm not going
anywhere without you!

873
01:29:08.886 --> 01:29:11.550
You gotta leave me!
Shut up and hold on!

874
01:30:19.294 --> 01:30:21.023
Jimmy, do a head count.

875
01:30:21.096 --> 01:30:23.623
I want to know
how many are injured and how bad.

876
01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:24.959
Injured?

877
01:30:26.368 --> 01:30:28.131
Four of us are dead!

878
01:30:34.844 --> 01:30:36.607
It's not your fault.

879
01:30:37.046 --> 01:30:39.742
What happened to Herb
is no one's fault.

880
01:30:40.217 --> 01:30:42.618
You're absolutely
right, Preston.

881
01:30:43.022 --> 01:30:45.420
And I'll tell you
something else.

882
01:30:45.489 --> 01:30:47.788
Herbert didn't die for nothing.

883
01:30:48.191 --> 01:30:50.990
He died for what he believed
in, and I'm gonna honor that.

884
01:30:51.061 --> 01:30:55.123
He died believing there was still
some mystery left in this world.

885
01:30:55.601 --> 01:30:58.194
And we could all have
a piece of it...

886
01:30:58.404 --> 01:31:00.929
for the price
of an admission ticket.

887
01:31:01.173 --> 01:31:04.869
God damn it, Preston, we're gonna
finish this film for Herb.

888
01:31:05.273 --> 01:31:06.934
We'll finish it...

889
01:31:07.041 --> 01:31:09.942
and donate the proceeds
to his wife and kids.

890
01:31:17.687 --> 01:31:19.853
Come on, guys. We
need more rope.

891
01:31:21.584 --> 01:31:23.576
All right, we gotta
get back to the ship.

892
01:31:23.653 --> 01:31:27.347
Englehorn sails in nine hours. So?
We gotta find Miss Darrow.

893
01:31:27.422 --> 01:31:29.888
Hey, do you hear me? We're
gonna be stranded here.

894
01:31:32.459 --> 01:31:35.857
Look, fellows, Miss Darrow
was a great gal, no question.

895
01:31:35.926 --> 01:31:37.658
And she was a wonderful person.

896
01:31:37.731 --> 01:31:40.961
It's a terrible loss and we're
all gonna miss her.

897
01:31:41.266 --> 01:31:45.167
I always knew you were nothing
like the tough guy you play on screen.

898
01:31:45.236 --> 01:31:46.966
I just never figured
you for a coward.

899
01:31:47.038 --> 01:31:49.165
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

900
01:31:49.708 --> 01:31:52.176
Heroes don't look like me,
not in the real world.

901
01:31:52.244 --> 01:31:55.805
In the real world, they got bad
teeth, a bald spot, and a beer gut.

902
01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:59.409
I'm just an actor with a gun,
who's lost his motivation.

903
01:32:00.854 --> 01:32:02.345
Be seeing you.

904
01:32:03.594 --> 01:32:04.955
Anyone else?

905
01:32:06.494 --> 01:32:08.463
Well, see you. Come on.

906
01:37:04.707 --> 01:37:05.900
No!

907
01:37:06.607 --> 01:37:08.042
I said no!

908
01:37:15.518 --> 01:37:19.081
That's all there is.
There isn't any more.

909
01:39:41.413 --> 01:39:44.202
Get them off the boat.
Get them off the boat.

910
01:39:46.579 --> 01:39:47.957
Keep paddling.

911
01:40:25.907 --> 01:40:27.833
What the hell was that?

912
01:41:08.858 --> 01:41:11.241
Come on. Get them out of there!

913
01:41:13.016 --> 01:41:14.368
Preston!

914
01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:21.164
Give me your hand.

915
01:41:21.756 --> 01:41:22.963
Jack!

916
01:41:28.424 --> 01:41:29.718
Jack!

917
01:41:34.513 --> 01:41:35.804
- Choy!
- Help!

918
01:41:35.894 --> 01:41:37.929
Swim, you filthy bugger.

919
01:42:46.907 --> 01:42:48.401
Choy!

920
01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:51.323
Stay with him.

921
01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.823
Swim to shore
as fast as you can!

922
01:42:52.913 --> 01:42:53.913
Hold on. Preston!

923
01:42:54.662 --> 01:42:57.021
Whatever happens, don't
let go of the camera!

924
01:42:57.121 --> 01:42:58.707
Don't let go of the camera!

925
01:43:06.508 --> 01:43:08.288
Come on, get
up out of that water.

926
01:43:09.804 --> 01:43:11.103
Get up!

927
01:43:50.885 --> 01:43:52.380
Come on, come on.

928
01:44:04.729 --> 01:44:06.680
Preston. Preston.

929
01:44:18.362 --> 01:44:19.571
It's working.

930
01:44:37.917 --> 01:44:39.919
Did you get that, did you?

931
01:45:40.272 --> 01:45:41.600
No!

932
01:45:42.441 --> 01:45:43.610
No.

933
01:45:47.892 --> 01:45:48.977
No.

934
01:46:38.633 --> 01:46:39.758
What is it?

935
01:46:44.538 --> 01:46:45.835
Mr. Hayes?

936
01:46:49.409 --> 01:46:52.003
If anything happens,
I want you to run.

937
01:46:52.514 --> 01:46:53.775
You understand?

938
01:46:54.349 --> 01:46:57.318
I'm not a coward.
I ain't gonna run.

939
01:46:58.856 --> 01:47:00.824
It's not about being
brave, Jimmy.

940
01:47:29.453 --> 01:47:30.478
Go back!

941
01:47:32.524 --> 01:47:33.923
Back across the log!

942
01:47:34.125 --> 01:47:36.685
I ain't gonna run! Get
Jimmy out of here!

943
01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:38.226
No! Get back! Get back!

944
01:47:43.137 --> 01:47:44.467
Move back!

945
01:48:02.133 --> 01:48:03.192
No!

946
01:48:08.473 --> 01:48:09.769
Look at me.

947
01:48:12.010 --> 01:48:14.569
Let him go! You got
to run, Jimmy.

948
01:48:18.751 --> 01:48:20.117
Do as I say.

949
01:48:21.454 --> 01:48:22.853
Go with Jack.

950
01:48:25.291 --> 01:48:26.349
Run!

951
01:48:29.895 --> 01:48:32.295
No! Shoot him!

952
01:48:33.832 --> 01:48:34.833
No!

953
01:48:49.883 --> 01:48:52.683
Here! Over here!

954
01:49:10.986 --> 01:49:12.954
Hold on! Hold on!

955
01:49:17.059 --> 01:49:19.324
Lumpy! Help me!

956
01:49:21.564 --> 01:49:22.964
Bloody hell, Choy!

957
01:54:44.932 --> 01:54:45.989
No!

958
01:54:50.172 --> 01:54:51.367
Oh, my!

959
02:01:26.853 --> 02:01:28.150
Wait!

960
02:02:17.642 --> 02:02:18.769
Carl.

961
02:02:23.849 --> 02:02:25.440
Jimmy. Jimmy.

962
02:02:26.317 --> 02:02:27.318
Jimmy.

963
02:02:28.422 --> 02:02:29.582
You all right?

964
02:03:19.538 --> 02:03:20.802
No.

965
02:04:13.065 --> 02:04:15.088
Get off! Get it off!

966
02:04:22.643 --> 02:04:23.667
Get off!

967
02:04:37.553 --> 02:04:38.645
Get it off!

968
02:05:44.591 --> 02:05:45.717
Kill it!

969
02:05:57.806 --> 02:05:59.207
Stop moving!

970
02:06:19.261 --> 02:06:20.990
Get it off my face!

971
02:06:21.963 --> 02:06:24.362
Stay still. I am standing still.

972
02:06:26.867 --> 02:06:28.666
- Hold on.
- Be careful!

973
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:06.133
Don't move! Stay
away from the walls!

974
02:07:06.811 --> 02:07:08.335
Coming through!

975
02:07:16.787 --> 02:07:19.384
Get out of there now! Climb!

976
02:07:26.681 --> 02:07:28.505
Nobody get in my way.

977
02:07:31.473 --> 02:07:33.229
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

978
02:07:33.316 --> 02:07:36.181
Get up the rope. Let's go.
Hurry up.

979
02:08:02.505 --> 02:08:04.571
Jimmy, let's go.

980
02:08:09.216 --> 02:08:10.799
- Come on.
- Okay.

981
02:08:14.009 --> 02:08:15.127
Go.

982
02:08:19.973 --> 02:08:21.859
Just as you go down...

983
02:08:22.889 --> 02:08:25.181
for the third and final time...

984
02:08:26.227 --> 02:08:29.148
as your head disappears
beneath the waves...

985
02:08:29.731 --> 02:08:32.147
and your lungs
fill with water...

986
02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:36.684
do you know what happens in those last
precious seconds before you drown?

987
02:08:36.934 --> 02:08:39.826
Come on, buddy. Get up the rope. Come on.
Get out of here. Come on.

988
02:08:39.903 --> 02:08:42.481
Your whole life passes
before your eyes.

989
02:08:42.668 --> 02:08:45.123
And if you've lived
as a true American...

990
02:08:45.195 --> 02:08:47.239
you get to watch
it all in colour.

991
02:08:48.457 --> 02:08:50.087
Oh, and you will.

992
02:08:50.167 --> 02:08:52.839
Now, why don't you climb
up the rope, huh? Come on.

993
02:08:58.037 --> 02:09:00.131
Come on, Driscoll. Let's go.

994
02:11:54.575 --> 02:11:56.097
It's beautiful.

995
02:12:17.565 --> 02:12:18.895
Beautiful.

996
02:12:30.382 --> 02:12:31.712
Beautiful.

997
02:13:19.128 --> 02:13:20.322
There.

998
02:13:23.405 --> 02:13:24.496
Thank God.

999
02:13:24.572 --> 02:13:26.537
Don't thank God.
Thank Mr. Baxter.

1000
02:13:26.637 --> 02:13:28.607
He insisted on a rescue mission.

1001
02:13:29.943 --> 02:13:33.401
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

1002
02:13:34.712 --> 02:13:36.975
That's the thing
about cockroaches.

1003
02:13:37.047 --> 02:13:40.487
No matter how many times you
flush them down the toilet...

1004
02:13:40.554 --> 02:13:43.045
they always crawl
back up the bowl.

1005
02:13:43.992 --> 02:13:46.822
Hey, buddy? I'm out of the bowl.

1006
02:13:47.595 --> 02:13:50.258
I'm dryin' off my wings
and trekkin' across the lid.

1007
02:13:58.205 --> 02:13:59.432
Driscoll!

1008
02:14:00.909 --> 02:14:04.575
Don't be a fool! Give it up.
It's useless!

1009
02:14:05.847 --> 02:14:07.210
She's dead.

1010
02:14:10.019 --> 02:14:11.578
She's not dead.

1011
02:14:15.488 --> 02:14:17.720
Jack's gonna bring her back...

1012
02:14:18.694 --> 02:14:21.287
and the ape will be
hard on his heels.

1013
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.525
We can still come
out of this thing okay.

1014
02:14:27.135 --> 02:14:28.696
More than okay.

1015
02:14:29.942 --> 02:14:31.498
Think about it.

1016
02:14:31.577 --> 02:14:34.403
You got a boat full of chloroform
we could put to good use.

1017
02:14:35.339 --> 02:14:37.239
You wanna trap the ape?

1018
02:14:44.087 --> 02:14:45.712
I don't think so.

1019
02:14:46.286 --> 02:14:49.726
Isn't that what you do?
Live animal capture?

1020
02:14:51.227 --> 02:14:52.989
I heard you were the best.

1021
02:15:01.104 --> 02:15:02.232
Jack!

1022
02:15:05.307 --> 02:15:07.070
Look after yourself!

1023
02:15:07.711 --> 02:15:09.337
Keep the gate open, will you?

1024
02:15:09.715 --> 02:15:11.113
Sure thing, buddy.

1025
02:15:12.150 --> 02:15:13.480
Good luck!

1026
02:15:26.764 --> 02:15:28.130
I'm sorry.

1027
02:18:06.996 --> 02:18:08.055
Ann.

1028
02:19:16.604 --> 02:19:17.697
Jack!

1029
02:19:18.574 --> 02:19:19.667
Run!

1030
02:19:49.973 --> 02:19:51.601
Jack, Jack!

1031
02:19:59.314 --> 02:20:00.474
Jack.

1032
02:20:09.527 --> 02:20:11.497
Ann, it's okay.

1033
02:20:12.332 --> 02:20:14.728
Ann, let's go. Let's go.
Come on!

1034
02:20:28.013 --> 02:20:29.379
Let's go. Come on.

1035
02:20:30.117 --> 02:20:31.346
Come on!

1036
02:22:03.615 --> 02:22:04.706
Carl!

1037
02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:07.577
Please! Somebody help us!

1038
02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:11.188
They've gone.

1039
02:22:12.758 --> 02:22:14.814
Carl. Christ.

1040
02:22:15.393 --> 02:22:16.484
Carl!

1041
02:22:17.326 --> 02:22:19.489
Drop the bridge. Do it
now, for Christ's sake!

1042
02:22:19.564 --> 02:22:20.791
Not yet.

1043
02:22:22.235 --> 02:22:23.327
Wait.

1044
02:22:24.004 --> 02:22:25.095
Wait.

1045
02:22:29.242 --> 02:22:30.335
Wait!

1046
02:22:41.055 --> 02:22:42.284
Come on!

1047
02:23:54.763 --> 02:23:56.253
Now! Throw them!

1048
02:23:56.332 --> 02:23:57.730
Throw!

1049
02:23:58.599 --> 02:23:59.624
No!

1050
02:24:02.005 --> 02:24:03.234
Hold him!

1051
02:24:03.307 --> 02:24:04.796
Are you out of your mind?

1052
02:24:13.519 --> 02:24:15.644
- ♪ Stop! Hold the line! ♪

1053
02:24:16.387 --> 02:24:17.785
Keep him down!

1054
02:24:23.363 --> 02:24:24.364
Heave!

1055
02:24:25.398 --> 02:24:26.728
Please!

1056
02:24:27.198 --> 02:24:28.893
No! Stop!

1057
02:24:29.234 --> 02:24:30.235
Jack.

1058
02:24:31.304 --> 02:24:32.567
No. Get her out of...

1059
02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:34.535
They'll kill him!
There's nothing we can do.

1060
02:24:34.602 --> 02:24:36.569
No! Get her out of his sight!

1061
02:24:36.637 --> 02:24:38.571
It's too late. Throw it!

1062
02:24:40.842 --> 02:24:41.937
Look out!

1063
02:24:44.248 --> 02:24:45.714
Let go of me.

1064
02:24:49.854 --> 02:24:51.482
We gotta go. Come on.

1065
02:24:52.058 --> 02:24:53.251
Come on. Stop it.

1066
02:24:53.324 --> 02:24:54.847
Leave me alone!

1067
02:24:56.026 --> 02:24:57.549
Ann, please come on.

1068
02:25:04.869 --> 02:25:06.700
No. No!

1069
02:25:06.904 --> 02:25:09.169
It's over, you goddamn lunatic!

1070
02:25:11.377 --> 02:25:12.901
All of you, run!

1071
02:25:12.979 --> 02:25:14.343
Come on. Come on!

1072
02:25:32.198 --> 02:25:33.774
Look out!

1073
02:25:44.530 --> 02:25:46.176
Move it! Move it!

1074
02:25:48.546 --> 02:25:49.911
Come on, come on!

1075
02:25:58.854 --> 02:26:00.483
Stay there! It's me he wants!

1076
02:26:00.557 --> 02:26:02.754
Please stop this! Move!
Hold onto her!

1077
02:26:02.828 --> 02:26:05.490
Ann, go. Please,
I can stop this!

1078
02:26:05.564 --> 02:26:07.087
No! Ann, stay there!

1079
02:26:09.568 --> 02:26:10.967
Get it out!

1080
02:26:13.707 --> 02:26:15.566
Get the hell out of here!

1081
02:26:15.636 --> 02:26:17.625
Come on! Jimmy, don't be crazy!
Come on.

1082
02:26:17.704 --> 02:26:19.001
Don't be crazy.

1083
02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:21.301
Let me go!

1084
02:26:22.644 --> 02:26:24.113
Cast off!

1085
02:26:26.416 --> 02:26:27.676
Come on, Carl!

1086
02:26:29.151 --> 02:26:30.983
- Row!
- Wait.

1087
02:26:31.255 --> 02:26:33.384
Row, God damn it!

1088
02:26:43.635 --> 02:26:44.760
Go back.

1089
02:26:51.677 --> 02:26:52.804
Jimmy, no!

1090
02:26:59.783 --> 02:27:00.784
No!

1091
02:27:17.869 --> 02:27:19.701
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

1092
02:27:19.771 --> 02:27:21.297
Hide out in the back!

1093
02:27:43.867 --> 02:27:45.494
Wait! No!

1094
02:27:46.202 --> 02:27:48.794
No! No! Please don't!

1095
02:29:47.025 --> 02:29:49.551
The whole world
will pay to see this.

1096
02:29:52.299 --> 02:29:54.289
We're millionaires, boys!

1097
02:29:54.602 --> 02:29:56.501
I'll share it with all of you!

1098
02:29:57.333 --> 02:30:01.831
In a few months his name will be
up in lights on Broadway!

1099
02:30:04.011 --> 02:30:08.107
Kong! The Eighth
Wonder of the World!

1100
02:31:11.415 --> 02:31:13.442
What can I say? What can I say?

1101
02:31:13.521 --> 02:31:14.919
Any comments, sir?

1102
02:31:16.251 --> 02:31:17.878
The Mayor, thank you.

1103
02:31:19.086 --> 02:31:20.088
Ready.

1104
02:31:20.255 --> 02:31:21.587
What am I?

1105
02:31:21.992 --> 02:31:23.723
Thank you very much.

1106
02:31:27.564 --> 02:31:29.053
Get used to it.

1107
02:31:29.264 --> 02:31:30.929
Listen, great to see you. Ready?

1108
02:31:31.002 --> 02:31:32.470
I'm really appreciating that...

1109
02:31:32.539 --> 02:31:34.005
Look at you! I remember you.

1110
02:31:34.072 --> 02:31:37.062
You're a lucky guy, Denham.
Am I a lucky guy?

1111
02:31:37.140 --> 02:31:38.937
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

1112
02:31:52.761 --> 02:31:53.921
Carl!

1113
02:31:55.794 --> 02:31:56.989
Zelman! I told you.

1114
02:31:57.062 --> 02:31:58.529
I know you did
and I appreciate it.

1115
02:31:58.597 --> 02:32:00.589
Let's get a shot of this.

1116
02:32:01.067 --> 02:32:02.194
Come on.

1117
02:32:02.938 --> 02:32:05.267
Big smile. Yeah! That's great!

1118
02:32:07.641 --> 02:32:10.577
<i>Look at yourself. Look
at what you've become.</i>

1119
02:32:11.209 --> 02:32:13.893
- ♪ No woman is worth this. ♪
♪ This woman is worth it. ♪

1120
02:32:13.918 --> 02:32:15.905
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.

1121
02:32:15.983 --> 02:32:17.211
Oh, really?

1122
02:32:17.283 --> 02:32:18.945
She's not gonna buy
this for a second.

1123
02:32:19.019 --> 02:32:21.215
Shut up and hand
me the grapefruit!

1124
02:32:23.358 --> 02:32:26.021
<i>- You're writing a comedy?
- Yes, I am.</i>

1125
02:32:26.762 --> 02:32:28.696
<i>I'm writing it for you.</i>

1126
02:32:30.634 --> 02:32:32.500
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

1127
02:32:33.503 --> 02:32:35.902
<i>Why would I write
a play for you?</i>

1128
02:32:39.305 --> 02:32:40.936
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

1129
02:32:41.210 --> 02:32:42.702
Oh, I'm sorry.

1130
02:32:43.948 --> 02:32:45.811
I couldn't help but overhear.

1131
02:32:49.317 --> 02:32:52.051
So, he took me to this
fancy French restaurant...

1132
02:32:52.124 --> 02:32:54.922
and halfway through the hors
d'oeuvres, he clutches my hand.

1133
02:32:54.994 --> 02:32:57.184
And that's when he told
you how he felt?

1134
02:32:57.257 --> 02:32:59.988
No. He never said it.
He never said it?

1135
02:33:00.060 --> 02:33:02.029
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.

1136
02:33:02.097 --> 02:33:04.122
Well, then how does
she know that it's real?

1137
02:33:04.199 --> 02:33:07.657
He said it was not about the words.
Oh, please!

1138
02:33:07.868 --> 02:33:12.001
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.

1139
02:33:12.376 --> 02:33:16.674
He said we'd talk about it later.
Only there was no later.

1140
02:33:18.413 --> 02:33:19.972
It never happened.

1141
02:33:20.984 --> 02:33:22.747
That's how it ended.

1142
02:33:22.886 --> 02:33:26.617
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?

1143
02:33:28.492 --> 02:33:31.860
I honestly believed things
might actually work out...

1144
02:33:32.965 --> 02:33:34.955
which was really very...

1145
02:33:38.235 --> 02:33:39.461
foolish.

1146
02:33:39.702 --> 02:33:42.333
Men. Oh, they'll give
you the world...

1147
02:33:42.408 --> 02:33:44.808
but they let the one thing
that truly matters...

1148
02:33:44.877 --> 02:33:46.776
slip through their fingers.

1149
02:33:46.845 --> 02:33:48.073
Typical.

1150
02:33:48.682 --> 02:33:52.346
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use their brains.

1151
02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:55.221
Romance. Who needs it?

1152
02:34:19.980 --> 02:34:21.313
Thank you.

1153
02:34:22.151 --> 02:34:23.515
Thank you.

1154
02:34:26.456 --> 02:34:27.786
Thank you.

1155
02:34:29.589 --> 02:34:30.957
Thank you.

1156
02:34:32.763 --> 02:34:34.230
Ladies and gentlemen...

1157
02:34:35.828 --> 02:34:38.318
I'm here to tell you
a very strange story.

1158
02:34:39.097 --> 02:34:40.826
The story of our adventure...

1159
02:34:41.665 --> 02:34:44.637
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths...

1160
02:34:45.603 --> 02:34:47.095
their lives lost...

1161
02:34:47.874 --> 02:34:49.967
in pursuit of a savage beast...

1162
02:34:51.145 --> 02:34:53.740
a monstrous
aberration of nature.

1163
02:34:54.982 --> 02:34:57.108
But even the meanest
brute can be tamed.

1164
02:34:57.851 --> 02:35:00.149
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
as you will see...

1165
02:35:00.620 --> 02:35:02.283
the beast was no match...

1166
02:35:02.891 --> 02:35:04.449
for the charms of a girl.

1167
02:35:07.928 --> 02:35:09.519
A girl from New York...

1168
02:35:12.736 --> 02:35:14.533
Who melted his heart...

1169
02:35:15.238 --> 02:35:17.831
bringing to mind that old
Arabian proverb...

1170
02:35:19.774 --> 02:35:22.939
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty..."

1171
02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:25.879
"and beauty stayed his hand."

1172
02:35:27.184 --> 02:35:31.053
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."

1173
02:35:38.829 --> 02:35:42.288
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you...

1174
02:35:42.435 --> 02:35:45.427
the greatest thing your eyes
have ever beheld.

1175
02:35:46.572 --> 02:35:51.237
He was a king in the world he knew,
but he comes to you now a captive.

1176
02:35:52.447 --> 02:35:54.108
Ladies and gentlemen...

1177
02:35:54.182 --> 02:35:58.708
I give you Kong, The Eighth
Wonder of the World!

1178
02:36:08.094 --> 02:36:11.224
Don't be alarmed.
It's perfectly safe.

1179
02:36:11.533 --> 02:36:14.969
These chains are made
of chrome steel!

1180
02:36:35.718 --> 02:36:37.516
Observe, if you will...

1181
02:36:40.791 --> 02:36:42.762
I am touching the beast.

1182
02:36:43.062 --> 02:36:47.295
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.

1183
02:36:54.442 --> 02:36:56.066
Crank 'em up, fellas.

1184
02:37:15.398 --> 02:37:17.591
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight...

1185
02:37:17.666 --> 02:37:19.294
a surprise guest.

1186
02:37:20.101 --> 02:37:22.298
The real-life hero
of this story.

1187
02:37:22.706 --> 02:37:25.139
The man who hunted
down the mighty Kong!

1188
02:37:26.809 --> 02:37:31.577
The man who risked all to win
the freedom of a helpless female.

1189
02:37:32.752 --> 02:37:35.083
A big hand for Mr. Bruce Baxter!

1190
02:37:40.958 --> 02:37:43.019
Thank you. Thank you.

1191
02:37:43.695 --> 02:37:44.855
Thank you.

1192
02:38:12.556 --> 02:38:13.989
He was right.

1193
02:38:15.558 --> 02:38:18.355
About there still being
some mystery left in this world...

1194
02:38:19.529 --> 02:38:21.827
and we can all have
a piece of it...

1195
02:38:22.198 --> 02:38:24.463
for the price
of an admission ticket.

1196
02:38:26.035 --> 02:38:28.334
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.

1197
02:38:30.442 --> 02:38:33.844
His unfailing ability
to destroy the things he loves.

1198
02:38:48.294 --> 02:38:50.887
Please remain calm,
ladies and gentlemen...

1199
02:38:50.964 --> 02:38:54.264
for we now come to the climax
of this savage ritual.

1200
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:56.959
The sacrifice
of a beautiful young girl.

1201
02:38:57.737 --> 02:39:01.367
Behold her terror as she is offered
up to the mighty Kong!

1202
02:39:02.610 --> 02:39:06.671
A big hand, folks, for the bravest
girl I've ever met!

1203
02:39:07.415 --> 02:39:08.678
Miss Ann Darrow.

1204
02:39:56.664 --> 02:39:58.393
Save me from the beast!

1205
02:40:07.276 --> 02:40:08.504
Help me!

1206
02:40:12.650 --> 02:40:13.947
Where is she?

1207
02:40:15.118 --> 02:40:16.675
Where's Ann? I have no idea.

1208
02:40:16.752 --> 02:40:20.152
I heard he offered her all kinds
of money and she turned him down flat.

Here's your story, boys.

1220
02:41:07.375 --> 02:41:10.469
"Beauty and the man who saved
her from the beast."

1221
02:41:16.217 --> 02:41:17.213
No.

1222
02:41:25.558 --> 02:41:27.423
We have to get these
people out of here.

1223
02:41:27.493 --> 02:41:29.485
Everyone needs to leave, okay?
Come on.

1224
02:41:31.230 --> 02:41:33.428
Let him roar. It makes
a swell picture.

1225
02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:36.292
Head for the exits.

1226
02:41:36.368 --> 02:41:38.804
Get your own seat, buddy.
You're not having mine.

1227
02:41:46.980 --> 02:41:48.210
Excuse me, fellows.

1228
02:41:49.151 --> 02:41:51.846
Coming through. Coming
through, fellows.

1229
02:41:55.423 --> 02:41:58.414
Get me down! Help me, please!

1230
02:42:00.829 --> 02:42:03.731

Come on, pal, we gotta
draw him off.

1241
02:45:20.304 --> 02:45:22.135
It's all yours, buddy.

1242
02:45:38.558 --> 02:45:40.286

Jesus Christ.

Fire!

1249
02:52:26.488 --> 02:52:27.581
Stop!

1250
02:52:43.060 --> 02:52:44.504
Listen up.

1251
02:52:44.593 --> 02:52:47.546
This is New York City,
and this is sacred ground.

1252
02:52:47.636 --> 02:52:49.091
You hear me?

1253
02:52:49.725 --> 02:52:52.349
It was built
for humans, by humans.

1254
02:52:52.433 --> 02:52:54.762
Not for stinking
lice-infested apes.

1255
02:52:55.017 --> 02:52:56.772
The thought
of some mutant gorilla...

1256
02:52:56.857 --> 02:53:01.558
crapping all over the streets of this
fair city, fills me with disgust.

1257
02:53:01.655 --> 02:53:03.655
So this is how it's gonna be.

1258
02:53:03.732 --> 02:53:06.068
We find it. We kill it.

1259
02:53:06.152 --> 02:53:09.405
We cut it's ugly head
off and we ram it up...

1260
02:53:29.430 --> 02:53:30.990
No. No.

1261
02:56:02.558 --> 02:56:03.890
Beautiful.

1262
02:56:10.336 --> 02:56:11.394
Yes.

1263
02:56:14.039 --> 02:56:15.403
Yes, it is.

1264
03:01:11.951 --> 03:01:13.077
Hey! Hey!

1265
03:01:13.353 --> 03:01:14.979
Nobody past this point.

1266
03:01:16.222 --> 03:01:17.848
You can't go in there!

1267
03:01:19.192 --> 03:01:20.191
Hey!

1268
03:01:22.294 --> 03:01:23.588
Stop him!

1269
03:01:26.695 --> 03:01:28.958
Hey! Get back. You're
not allowed up there!

Move along.

1277
03:09:18.427 --> 03:09:20.328
Just one shot! One shot!

1278
03:09:20.997 --> 03:09:23.091
Come, come! Boys,
how about a photo?

1279
03:09:23.167 --> 03:09:24.165
Look at me.

1280
03:09:24.266 --> 03:09:25.993
Come on, watch the camera.

1281
03:09:28.838 --> 03:09:30.362
Come a little closer.

1282
03:09:31.041 --> 03:09:33.237
That's it, folks. Show's over.
Step back!

1283
03:09:33.311 --> 03:09:35.504
Clear the area. That's it.
Shove off, boys.

1284
03:09:36.212 --> 03:09:37.770
Why'd he do that?

1285
03:09:38.079 --> 03:09:40.550
Climb up there and get
himself cornered.

1286
03:09:40.618 --> 03:09:42.946
The ape must have known
what was coming.

1287
03:09:43.017 --> 03:09:45.676
He's just a dumb animal.
Didn't know nothing.

1288
03:09:51.893 --> 03:09:54.622
What does it matter?
Airplanes got him.

1289
03:09:57.197 --> 03:09:59.168
It wasn't the airplanes.

1290
03:10:03.537 --> 03:10:05.834
It was beauty killed the beast.
