1
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:52.318
Oh!

2
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.235
That's a funny one.
Isn't that funnier?

3
00:03:10.303 --> 00:03:11.531
It's hysterical, Manny.

4
00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:13.004
As long as we're laughing...

5
00:03:13.073 --> 00:03:14.506
we won't cry
over the box office.

6
00:03:14.574 --> 00:03:16.166
Talk about depressing.

7
00:03:16.243 --> 00:03:19.770
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around
like circus ponies.

8
00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:21.370
That's depressing.

9
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:23.779
I love a good chorus line.

10
00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:28.377
What's this?
It's a play.

11
00:03:28.488 --> 00:03:29.955
Who wrote it, Annie?

12
00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:31.853
Some guy. Driscoll.

13
00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:33.553
Driscoll.

14
00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:35.492
From the Federal Theatre.

15
00:03:35.562 --> 00:03:38.929
Don't knock it, honey.
At least they got
an audience.

16
00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.534
It'll pick up.
Isn't that right, Manny?

17
00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.763
It always does.

18
00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:49.767
See you tomorrow.

19
00:03:49.843 --> 00:03:53.939
The trick is to
start to build right from
the back of your throat.

20
00:03:55.682 --> 00:03:57.650
Works well
out through the nose, too.

21
00:03:57.751 --> 00:03:59.548
Have you eaten today?

22
00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:00.711
Oh...

23
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.118
I'm not hungry.
Don't worry about me.

24
00:04:03.223 --> 00:04:04.383
Hey.

25
00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.422
You're all I've got.

26
00:04:08.895 --> 00:04:11.125
Come on, take me to dinner.

27
00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:13.125
Okay.

28
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.333
You think the kitchen
will still be open
on Third?

29
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.936
Soup and biscuits.
Perfect.

30
00:04:25.812 --> 00:04:27.939
Harry, what's going on?

31
00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.480
Hey, open up! We work here.
Not anymore, lady.

32
00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:36.113
It's all right for you.
We haven't had a paycheck
in two weeks.

33
00:04:36.222 --> 00:04:37.883
How we gonna eat?

34
00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:41.083
They're not getting away
with this!
They just did.

35
00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:43.595
Ann, it's no use.

36
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.594
The show, it's over.
It's done.

37
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.662
I'm done.

38
00:04:51.104 --> 00:04:52.833
I'm leaving, Annie.

39
00:04:54.574 --> 00:04:56.599
I'm going back to Chicago.

40
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.068
I'm sorry.

41
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.738
I'm sorry, Annie.

42
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.186
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

43
00:05:08.888 --> 00:05:11.152
You gotta
think of yourself now.

44
00:05:11.424 --> 00:05:14.018
You should try out
for that part.

45
00:05:16.763 --> 00:05:19.095
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

46
00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:23.065
Every time you reach out
for something
you care about...

47
00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:25.866
fate comes along
and snatches it away.

48
00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.530
But not this time, Annie.

49
00:05:29.142 --> 00:05:30.632
Not this time.

50
00:05:35.582 --> 00:05:37.914
Oh, hello, Mr. Weston.
Oh, jeez.

51
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:41.086
Look, miss,
I told you already,
call my office.

52
00:05:41.154 --> 00:05:43.088
Leave your r�sum�
with my secretary.

53
00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:46.216
Now, why would I want to
do that when we can
talk about it in person?

54
00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:47.919
Because that's what
a smart girl would do.

55
00:05:47.994 --> 00:05:50.462
But I already
sent you my r�sum�.
You returned it unopened.

56
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.556
What can I say? Jack
Driscoll's very particular
about who he works with.

57
00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:55.294
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

58
00:05:55.368 --> 00:05:56.562
Jesus, you don't give up,
do you?

59
00:05:56.636 --> 00:05:58.194
Mr. Weston,
I know this role backwards.

60
00:05:58.271 --> 00:06:01.172
Well, that's too bad,
'cause we just gave the part
to someone else.

61
00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:03.641
I'm sorry, kid.
The play is cast.

62
00:06:07.747 --> 00:06:09.408
I know times are tough.

63
00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:11.473
You want my advice?

64
00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:14.879
Use what you got.
You're not bad-looking.

65
00:06:14.988 --> 00:06:17.616
A girl like you
doesn't have to starve.

66
00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:22.317
There's a new place.
It just opened.

67
00:06:26.933 --> 00:06:30.528
Now listen, princess,
this gig ain't the Palace,
you understand?

68
00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:33.595
Ask for Kenny K.
Tell him I sent you.

69
00:06:34.808 --> 00:06:37.299
Just play the date,
take the money...

70
00:06:38.278 --> 00:06:40.269
forget you was ever there.

71
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.310
How much more is there?

72
00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:14.575
Another five reels.

73
00:07:14.948 --> 00:07:16.279
Lights up.

74
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.555
This is it?

75
00:07:26.226 --> 00:07:28.456
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?

76
00:07:28.528 --> 00:07:30.155
Another one of your
safari pictures?

77
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.324
You promised us romantic
scenes with Bruce Baxter
and Maureen McKenzie!

78
00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:35.094
Come on, fellows,
you know the deal.

79
00:07:35.168 --> 00:07:36.760
We agreed to push
Maureen's start date...

80
00:07:36.836 --> 00:07:38.394
so she could
get her teeth fixed.

81
00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:41.304
It's not the principle
of the thing, it's the money.

82
00:07:41.374 --> 00:07:43.934
Carl,
you've been in production
for over two months.

83
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.672
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up
the screen...

84
00:07:46.746 --> 00:07:48.646
once we get them on the ship.

85
00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:50.746
What ship?

86
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.644
The one that we hired
to get to the location.

87
00:07:53.753 --> 00:07:57.553
What location? Carl!
You're supposed to be
shooting on the back lot.

88
00:07:57.624 --> 00:07:59.114
Yes, I understand that.

89
00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:01.523
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...

90
00:08:01.594 --> 00:08:02.856
and I'll tell you why.

91
00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:05.762
The story has changed.
The script has been rewritten.

92
00:08:05.832 --> 00:08:07.959
Life intervened.

93
00:08:08.902 --> 00:08:11.427
I've come into possession
of a map.

94
00:08:12.705 --> 00:08:15.868
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

95
00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:19.069
A place that was
thought to exist
only in myth.

96
00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:20.403
Until now.

97
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.505
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

98
00:08:22.615 --> 00:08:23.912
Is he asking for more money?

99
00:08:24.017 --> 00:08:26.577
He's asking us
to fund a wild goose chase.

100
00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:31.123
I'm talking about
a primitive world
never before seen by man.

101
00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:35.317
The ruins
of an entire civilization.

102
00:08:36.596 --> 00:08:39.497
The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.

103
00:08:40.533 --> 00:08:43.024
That's where
I'll shoot my picture.

104
00:08:45.538 --> 00:08:47.403
Will there be boobies?

105
00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:49.869
Boobies?

106
00:08:50.343 --> 00:08:53.039
Jigglies. Jiblonkas.
Bazooms.

107
00:08:53.246 --> 00:08:55.908
In my experience,
people only go
to these films...

108
00:08:56.015 --> 00:08:59.382
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.

109
00:08:59.552 --> 00:09:00.951
What are you, an idiot?

110
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.217
You think they asked De Mille
if he would waste his time
on nudie shots?

111
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.919
No! They respected
the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

112
00:09:07.994 --> 00:09:11.452
Not that you'd know
what that means,
you cheap lowlife!

113
00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:18.229
Would you step out
for a moment, Carl?

114
00:09:29.482 --> 00:09:31.473
Zelman and Associates.

115
00:09:31.985 --> 00:09:33.714
Give me that, quick.

116
00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:37.412
You won't like it.
It's non-alcoholic.

117
00:09:37.523 --> 00:09:41.653
Preston, you have
a lot to learn about
the motion picture business.

118
00:09:44.597 --> 00:09:47.191
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...

119
00:09:47.267 --> 00:09:50.236
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

120
00:09:50.303 --> 00:09:52.601
He's had a lot of
near-success.

121
00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:55.107
He's a preening self-promoter.

122
00:09:55.174 --> 00:09:58.473
An ambitious no-talent.
The guy's got "loser"
written all over him.

123
00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:00.034
I understand
your disappointment...

124
00:10:00.113 --> 00:10:02.240
He can't direct.
He doesn't have the smarts.

125
00:10:02.348 --> 00:10:05.112
He's washed up.
It's all over town.

126
00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:08.613
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.

127
00:10:08.721 --> 00:10:10.552
The animal footage has value.

128
00:10:10.623 --> 00:10:13.057
Sure. Universal are
desperate for stock footage.

129
00:10:13.126 --> 00:10:15.526
Then sell it!
Scrap the picture.

130
00:10:18.298 --> 00:10:20.960
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

131
00:10:22.869 --> 00:10:24.461
Get him back in.

132
00:10:25.538 --> 00:10:27.096
Mr. Denham.

133
00:10:30.043 --> 00:10:32.307
I want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.

134
00:10:32.378 --> 00:10:33.504
No, Carl,
you can't do this.

135
00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:35.740
Tell them the studio
pressured us into
an early departure.

136
00:10:35.848 --> 00:10:37.839
It's not ethical!
What are they gonna do,
sue me?

137
00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:39.009
They can get in line.

138
00:10:39.118 --> 00:10:40.551
I'm not gonna let them
kill my film.

139
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.056
You realize that none of
the camera equipment
is on board?

140
00:10:44.123 --> 00:10:46.921
We have no permits,
no visas.

141
00:10:46.993 --> 00:10:48.620
That's why I have you,
Preston.

142
00:10:48.695 --> 00:10:50.788
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

143
00:10:50.863 --> 00:10:52.797
In fact, we have
no currency of any kind.

144
00:10:52.865 --> 00:10:53.854
He's there.

145
00:10:53.933 --> 00:10:55.764
Get in there.
Who's gonna pay
for the ship?

146
00:10:55.835 --> 00:10:56.927
Get in.

147
00:10:59.739 --> 00:11:03.334
You get out of there!
Come here!
Step on it! Step on it!

148
00:11:03.443 --> 00:11:06.503
Get out!
You're finished, Denham!

149
00:11:09.415 --> 00:11:12.714
Don't worry, Preston.
I've had a lot of practice
at this.

150
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.348
I'm real good
at crapping the crappers.

151
00:11:17.724 --> 00:11:19.783
Red Label, 80% proof...

152
00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:21.690
to be packed in a crate
marked "Lemonade."

153
00:11:21.761 --> 00:11:22.819
You got it.

154
00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:25.261
Tell Maureen
she doesn't have six hours
to put on her face.

155
00:11:25.331 --> 00:11:27.629
If she wants to be
in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

156
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.328
She doesn't wanna be
in this picture.

157
00:11:31.504 --> 00:11:34.098
Maureen pulled out.
She pulled out?

158
00:11:34.173 --> 00:11:36.266
Yesterday. I told you.

159
00:11:36.609 --> 00:11:38.975
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

160
00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:41.036
That's what you told her.

161
00:11:41.514 --> 00:11:44.108
Yeah, but we're not
shooting in Singapore.

162
00:11:44.217 --> 00:11:48.517
God damn it, Preston,
all you had to do was
look her in the eye and lie.

163
00:11:48.788 --> 00:11:51.279
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

164
00:11:51.391 --> 00:11:52.824
She's unavailable.

165
00:11:52.892 --> 00:11:55.725
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow?
Mae West?

166
00:11:56.029 --> 00:11:58.088
You'll never get her
into a size four.

167
00:11:58.164 --> 00:12:01.656
You gotta get a girl
that'll fit into
Maureen's costumes.

168
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.230
Fay's a size four.

169
00:12:05.304 --> 00:12:08.796
Yes, she is, but she's
doing a picture with RKO.

170
00:12:10.476 --> 00:12:11.875
Cooper, huh?

171
00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:15.408
I might have known.

172
00:12:16.249 --> 00:12:18.217
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

173
00:12:18.284 --> 00:12:20.752
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

174
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.253
Not an option.
Carl.

175
00:12:22.321 --> 00:12:23.788
I said I'd find a girl.

176
00:12:23.856 --> 00:12:26.120
For God's sake, Preston,
think like a winner!

177
00:12:26.192 --> 00:12:29.025
Call Jack. I need that
goddamn screenplay!

178
00:12:30.897 --> 00:12:32.956
Defeat is always momentary.

179
00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:07.958
What?

180
00:14:02.255 --> 00:14:05.554
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

181
00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:08.157
Excuse me.

182
00:14:10.363 --> 00:14:12.695
Ma'am,
I think you dropped this.

183
00:14:22.275 --> 00:14:23.936
Vaudeville, huh?

184
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.036
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

185
00:14:27.113 --> 00:14:28.910
If you don't kill them fast,
they kill you.

186
00:14:28.981 --> 00:14:30.471
Mr. Denham...

187
00:14:31.517 --> 00:14:32.484
I want you to know...

188
00:14:32.585 --> 00:14:35.383
that I'm not in the habit
of accepting charity
from strangers.

189
00:14:35.454 --> 00:14:37.319
Or, for that matter...

190
00:14:37.957 --> 00:14:39.925
taking things
that don't belong to me.

191
00:14:40.026 --> 00:14:41.926
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

192
00:14:41.994 --> 00:14:43.962
It's just that
I haven't been paid
in a while.

193
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.431
That's awful. Anyway, Ann...
May I call you Ann?

194
00:14:50.536 --> 00:14:53.903
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

195
00:14:56.475 --> 00:14:58.466
No, no. Oh, God, no.

196
00:14:58.544 --> 00:15:01.012
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

197
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.173
I'm not that type
of person at all.

198
00:15:03.282 --> 00:15:04.943
What type of person are you?

199
00:15:05.051 --> 00:15:08.020
I'm someone
you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

200
00:15:08.087 --> 00:15:12.148
Believe me, I am on
the level. No funny business.
Please sit down.

201
00:15:12.425 --> 00:15:14.791
Please. Please.

202
00:15:18.698 --> 00:15:19.790
Okay.

203
00:15:21.767 --> 00:15:23.325
Ann, I want you to imagine...

204
00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:26.064
a handsome explorer
bound for the Far East.

205
00:15:26.138 --> 00:15:28.436
You're filming
in the Far East?

206
00:15:28.674 --> 00:15:30.005
Singapore.

207
00:15:32.044 --> 00:15:34.842
On board ship,
he meets a mysterious girl.

208
00:15:35.147 --> 00:15:38.742
She's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.

209
00:15:39.385 --> 00:15:42.548
And she can't
escape the feeling that
forces beyond her control...

210
00:15:42.622 --> 00:15:46.524
are compelling her
down a road from which
she cannot draw back.

211
00:15:46.826 --> 00:15:50.785
It's as if her whole life
has been a prelude
to this moment...

212
00:15:52.632 --> 00:15:56.534
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.

213
00:15:57.603 --> 00:16:01.095
And sure enough, against
her better judgment...

214
00:16:01.374 --> 00:16:02.864
She falls in love.

215
00:16:03.576 --> 00:16:04.634
Yes.

216
00:16:04.777 --> 00:16:06.768
But she doesn't trust it.

217
00:16:07.013 --> 00:16:09.914
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.

218
00:16:11.384 --> 00:16:12.373
Uh...

219
00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:13.645
really?

220
00:16:13.853 --> 00:16:16.219
If she loves someone,
it's doomed.

221
00:16:16.289 --> 00:16:17.688
Why is that?

222
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.681
Good things never last,
Mr. Denham.

223
00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:28.765
So you're interested. Good.
That's settled, then.

224
00:16:28.834 --> 00:16:31.359
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under
some time pressure.

225
00:16:31.437 --> 00:16:33.871
Well, I really...
Ann, I'm telling you...

226
00:16:33.939 --> 00:16:35.270
you're perfect. Look at you.

227
00:16:35.341 --> 00:16:37.332
You're the saddest girl
I've ever met.

228
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.506
You're gonna make them weep,
Ann. You're gonna
break their hearts.

229
00:16:42.882 --> 00:16:44.873
See, that's where
you're wrong, Mr. Denham.

230
00:16:44.984 --> 00:16:47.544
I make people laugh,
that's what I do.

231
00:16:48.087 --> 00:16:50.180
Good luck with your picture.

232
00:16:53.426 --> 00:16:55.621
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

233
00:16:55.695 --> 00:16:57.094
I'm offering you money.

234
00:16:57.163 --> 00:17:00.758
Adventure, fame,
the thrill of a lifetime,
and a long sea voyage.

235
00:17:00.833 --> 00:17:01.925
You want to read a script?

236
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:05.061
Jack Driscoll's turning in
a draft as we speak.

237
00:17:06.972 --> 00:17:08.439
Jack Driscoll?

238
00:17:08.507 --> 00:17:09.838
Sure. Why?

239
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:11.900
Wait. You know him?

240
00:17:13.012 --> 00:17:16.539
No, not personally.
I've seen his plays.

241
00:17:16.682 --> 00:17:18.650
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann...

242
00:17:18.718 --> 00:17:21.710
Jack Driscoll does not
want just anyone
starring in this picture.

243
00:17:21.821 --> 00:17:23.186
He said to me, "Carl..."

244
00:17:23.255 --> 00:17:26.622
"somewhere out there
is a woman
born to play this role."

245
00:17:26.692 --> 00:17:29.092
And as soon as I saw you,
I knew.

246
00:17:31.397 --> 00:17:32.728
Knew what?

247
00:17:34.734 --> 00:17:36.998
It was always
going to be you.

248
00:17:49.115 --> 00:17:51.549
How much do I owe you?
Make it a quarter.

249
00:17:51.617 --> 00:17:53.175
Keep the change.

250
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.052
Is this
the moving picture ship?

251
00:17:58.657 --> 00:18:00.056
Not exactly.

252
00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:02.491
It's actually
this one over here.

253
00:18:12.037 --> 00:18:16.167
Don't let appearances
deceive you. It's much more
spacious on board.

254
00:18:17.443 --> 00:18:19.104
Is this all of the equipment?
Yeah.

255
00:18:19.178 --> 00:18:20.270
This is all of it?
Yeah.

256
00:18:20.346 --> 00:18:21.938
We're taking
the Bell & Howell?
Yeah.

257
00:18:22.014 --> 00:18:24.710
Good. You got all the lenses?
Sure.

258
00:18:24.817 --> 00:18:26.341
Carl!
Yes!

259
00:18:26.452 --> 00:18:28.818
Get it on board, fellows,
come on.

260
00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:33.615
It's bad, it's bad.

261
00:18:33.692 --> 00:18:35.592
They're on their way.
I've just had word.

262
00:18:35.661 --> 00:18:37.788
Who?
Men in uniform.

263
00:18:37.863 --> 00:18:39.956
The studio called the cops.

264
00:18:42.435 --> 00:18:44.460
Englehorn! Cast off!

265
00:18:44.537 --> 00:18:46.437
Hoist up the mainsail,
raise the anchor...

266
00:18:46.505 --> 00:18:48.564
whatever the hell it is
you do. We gotta leave!

267
00:18:48.641 --> 00:18:50.302
I cannot do that.

268
00:18:50.709 --> 00:18:52.643
We are waiting
on the manifest.

269
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:55.179
What? Who? English, please.

270
00:18:55.448 --> 00:18:57.313
Paperwork, Mr. Denham.

271
00:18:58.384 --> 00:19:00.944
I'll give you another $1,000
to leave now.

272
00:19:01.053 --> 00:19:03.487
You haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.

273
00:19:04.423 --> 00:19:05.720
Can we talk about this later?

274
00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:08.624
Can't you see
we're in the company
of a VIP guest?

275
00:19:14.433 --> 00:19:15.730
Ma'am.

276
00:19:16.635 --> 00:19:18.000
Ann Darrow.

277
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:22.163
So you are ready
for this voyage, Miss Darrow?

278
00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:23.533
Sure.

279
00:19:25.444 --> 00:19:26.672
Nervous?

280
00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:31.248
Nervous? No.

281
00:19:31.717 --> 00:19:34.550
Why? Should I be?

282
00:19:34.987 --> 00:19:37.717
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

283
00:19:40.392 --> 00:19:43.793
Why don't I show
Miss Darrow to her cabin?

284
00:19:44.296 --> 00:19:46.662
Wonderful idea.
Thank you, Preston.

285
00:19:46.732 --> 00:19:49.166
Miss Darrow,
if you would just...

286
00:19:51.103 --> 00:19:54.561
Hi. My name is Preston.
Carl's assistant.

287
00:19:54.807 --> 00:19:57.674
$2,000. It's a deal.
Will you take a check?

288
00:19:58.277 --> 00:20:00.006
Do I have a choice?

289
00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.579
Please follow me.

290
00:20:02.681 --> 00:20:04.911
If there's anything
that you...
Excuse me, fellows.

291
00:20:05.017 --> 00:20:08.919
If there's anything
that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

292
00:20:27.406 --> 00:20:29.772
Oh, Jesus!
Jack, you scared me.

293
00:20:29.842 --> 00:20:34.245
Listen. If anyone comes
to the door, don't open it.
You haven't seen me.

294
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.905
Say I got depressed
and committed suicide.

295
00:20:37.016 --> 00:20:39.177
Say I stuck my head
down the toilet.

296
00:20:40.152 --> 00:20:42.177
You want one?
No. I can't stay, Carl.

297
00:20:42.288 --> 00:20:45.314
I got a rehearsal for which
I am now three hours late.

298
00:20:46.225 --> 00:20:48.557
What's this?
It's the script.

299
00:20:51.697 --> 00:20:53.324
This is a script?

300
00:20:53.933 --> 00:20:56.197
Jack, this is 15 pages.

301
00:20:56.268 --> 00:20:58.896
I know, but they're good.
You've got 15 good pages
there, Carl.

302
00:20:58.971 --> 00:21:00.905
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

303
00:21:00.973 --> 00:21:03.373
You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

304
00:21:03.442 --> 00:21:05.467
No, Jack, you can't
do this to me.
I have a beginning...

305
00:21:05.544 --> 00:21:08.138
but I need a middle
and an end. I gotta have
something to shoot.

306
00:21:08.213 --> 00:21:11.410
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

307
00:21:15.888 --> 00:21:18.379
All right, fine.
We might as well settle up.

308
00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:21.290
You're gonna pay me?

309
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.294
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

310
00:21:25.497 --> 00:21:28.295
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

311
00:21:28.367 --> 00:21:30.198
How's $2,000 sound?

312
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.303
Sounds great.

313
00:21:33.372 --> 00:21:35.101
I thought it might.

314
00:21:35.174 --> 00:21:37.699
Sounds great.
Okay.

315
00:21:38.744 --> 00:21:40.575
Raise the spring line!

316
00:21:40.646 --> 00:21:42.238
Watch the aft!

317
00:21:50.823 --> 00:21:52.415
And voilà.

318
00:21:53.092 --> 00:21:54.286
Thanks.

319
00:21:57.062 --> 00:21:59.155
You've written "two grand."

320
00:22:01.266 --> 00:22:04.929
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from
the beginning.

321
00:22:05.304 --> 00:22:07.704
"Two thousand dollars."

322
00:22:15.614 --> 00:22:17.275
It is the 29th, isn't it?

323
00:22:17.383 --> 00:22:20.147
Oh, come on, it's the 25th.
It's the 25th.

324
00:22:20.552 --> 00:22:22.782
God, I'm sorry.
It'll just take a sec.

325
00:22:22.855 --> 00:22:25.016
Never mind, Carl.
Just pay me
when you get back.

326
00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.455
All right.

327
00:22:39.872 --> 00:22:42.932
Your cabin is the last
on the left, Mr. Baxter.

328
00:22:43.008 --> 00:22:47.502
And may I just say how
excited we are to have you
back with us, sir?

329
00:22:47.613 --> 00:22:49.376
Be a sport
and lend a hand here,
would you?

330
00:22:49.481 --> 00:22:51.949
Excuse me. I'm trying to...
I gotta get...

331
00:22:54.553 --> 00:22:55.713
Christ!

332
00:22:56.555 --> 00:22:58.455
Appreciate the help, fellow.

333
00:22:58.524 --> 00:23:00.583
Let me get the door for you.

334
00:23:01.326 --> 00:23:03.851
Welcome to your
stateroom, sir.

335
00:23:09.401 --> 00:23:11.460
Dead slow ahead both,
Mr. Hayes.

336
00:23:11.537 --> 00:23:13.471
Dead slow ahead both,
Captain.

337
00:23:21.346 --> 00:23:22.813
Oh, Christ!

338
00:23:32.257 --> 00:23:33.656
God damn it!

339
00:23:42.067 --> 00:23:45.503
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theater.

340
00:23:48.507 --> 00:23:50.031
Oh, no! No!

341
00:23:51.477 --> 00:23:54.275
You're much better off
sticking with film.

342
00:23:54.513 --> 00:23:56.947
I don't do it
for the money, Carl.

343
00:23:58.383 --> 00:24:00.476
I happen to love the theater.

344
00:24:00.953 --> 00:24:02.420
No, you don't.

345
00:24:03.722 --> 00:24:05.690
If you really loved it...

346
00:24:06.158 --> 00:24:07.750
you would have jumped.

347
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.430
You! This is your fault!

348
00:24:27.846 --> 00:24:31.009
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light,
fresh straw.

349
00:24:31.116 --> 00:24:33.107
Jesus. What do you keep
down here?

350
00:24:33.218 --> 00:24:35.550
Lion, tiger, hippo,
you name it.

351
00:24:36.588 --> 00:24:38.317
You sell them to zoos?

352
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:39.982
Zoo, circus.

353
00:24:40.259 --> 00:24:42.887
Skipper get big money
for rare animal.

354
00:24:43.028 --> 00:24:46.156
Careful. Camel have
bad accident on floor.

355
00:24:46.331 --> 00:24:47.992
Stain unremovable.

356
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.604
Skipper catch
any wild animal you want.

357
00:24:53.672 --> 00:24:55.572
He'll do you real good price
on white rhino.

358
00:24:55.641 --> 00:24:56.733
Choy.

359
00:24:59.044 --> 00:25:02.343
My apologies for not being
able to offer you a cabin.

360
00:25:02.447 --> 00:25:05.245
Have you found an enclosure
to your taste?

361
00:25:06.451 --> 00:25:07.782
Spoiled for choice.

362
00:25:07.853 --> 00:25:10.583
What are you, Mr. Driscoll?
A lion?

363
00:25:11.657 --> 00:25:13.386
Or a chimpanzee?

364
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.487
I'll take this one.

365
00:25:29.441 --> 00:25:31.102
I told you to lock it up.

366
00:25:31.176 --> 00:25:34.703
Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said...
Lumpy doesn't
give the orders!

367
00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.840
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?

368
00:25:41.186 --> 00:25:42.983
Get them out of here.

369
00:26:18.023 --> 00:26:20.958
Compliments of the chef.
Okay.

370
00:26:26.331 --> 00:26:28.356
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

371
00:26:28.934 --> 00:26:31.266
Lamb's brains
in walnut sauce.

372
00:26:36.942 --> 00:26:38.102
Jimmy.

373
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.278
You run those ropes
up on deck like I told you?

374
00:26:40.345 --> 00:26:42.336
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

375
00:26:42.648 --> 00:26:46.584
How about you return
Mr. Driscoll's pen first?

376
00:26:54.393 --> 00:26:56.258
He don't mean no harm.

377
00:26:57.262 --> 00:26:58.251
Thanks.

378
00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.093
I'll keep him
out of your way.
It's okay.

379
00:27:00.165 --> 00:27:02.633
It's just that
he likes it down here.

380
00:27:02.734 --> 00:27:05.328
It's where I found him
four years ago.

381
00:27:05.637 --> 00:27:08.231
Stowed away
in one of them back cages.

382
00:27:09.508 --> 00:27:11.942
His arm was broken
in two places.

383
00:27:13.145 --> 00:27:16.012
He was wilder than
half the animals in here.

384
00:27:16.949 --> 00:27:19.509
Still won't tell me
where he came from.

385
00:27:20.719 --> 00:27:22.812
But it wasn't anyplace good.

386
00:27:25.524 --> 00:27:27.515
You got to straighten up.

387
00:27:27.793 --> 00:27:28.953
Jimmy.

388
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:32.753
You don't want to
be on this ship
the rest of your life.

389
00:27:32.831 --> 00:27:35.197
Yes, I do.
No, you don't, Jimmy.

390
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.766
You got to be smart.
Get yourself educated.

391
00:27:37.836 --> 00:27:39.770
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!

392
00:27:39.838 --> 00:27:41.965
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do. Look.

393
00:27:42.107 --> 00:27:43.597
I've been reading.

394
00:27:46.545 --> 00:27:48.240
Where'd you get this?

395
00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.569
I borrowed it.

396
00:27:53.151 --> 00:27:55.051
On long-term loan.

397
00:27:55.554 --> 00:27:56.987
Look at this. Look, look.

398
00:27:57.055 --> 00:28:00.252
"Adventures on
a tramp steamer."
See? Just like us.

399
00:28:07.332 --> 00:28:09.960
It's so nice to meet you,
Mr. Driscoll.

400
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:13.536
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.

401
00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:20.637
Hello, Mr. Driscoll.
It's so nice to meet you.

402
00:28:20.779 --> 00:28:23.680
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.

403
00:28:24.383 --> 00:28:25.975
I'm a huge fan.

404
00:28:26.084 --> 00:28:28.018
I've read everything
you've ever written.

405
00:28:28.086 --> 00:28:29.553
No, too much.

406
00:28:30.255 --> 00:28:33.520
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialogue.

407
00:28:34.259 --> 00:28:35.590
Seagulls.

408
00:28:36.628 --> 00:28:38.755
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.

409
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:39.990
I don't care, Mike.

410
00:28:40.065 --> 00:28:42.465
You're the sound recordist.
Make it work.

411
00:28:43.935 --> 00:28:46.733
Ann! Come on in.
Let me introduce you
to the crew.

412
00:28:46.805 --> 00:28:49.000
This is Herb, the cameraman.

413
00:28:49.574 --> 00:28:52.270
Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
Likewise.

414
00:28:52.344 --> 00:28:54.505
May I say
what a lovely dress?

415
00:28:54.579 --> 00:28:57.480
Oh, this old thing?
I just threw it on.

416
00:28:58.016 --> 00:29:00.450
Isn't that
one of Maureen's costumes?

417
00:29:00.852 --> 00:29:04.583
Now, what does a girl
have to do around here
to get some breakfast?

418
00:29:04.656 --> 00:29:06.647
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

419
00:29:06.758 --> 00:29:10.216
Fancy my porridge
� la walnuts?

420
00:29:14.332 --> 00:29:16.960
Oh, Ann, I don't believe
you've met...

421
00:29:19.371 --> 00:29:20.429
Ann?

422
00:29:20.906 --> 00:29:24.069
That's all right, Mr. Denham.
I know who this is.

423
00:29:29.381 --> 00:29:32.976
Thrilled to meet you.
It's an honor to be
a part of this.

424
00:29:34.252 --> 00:29:35.651
Gee, thanks.

425
00:29:36.254 --> 00:29:39.155
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.

426
00:29:39.591 --> 00:29:40.785
Really?

427
00:29:41.593 --> 00:29:43.652
Yes,
and what I most admire...

428
00:29:43.728 --> 00:29:47.357
is the way
you've captured the voice
of the common people.

429
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.397
Well, that's my job.

430
00:29:53.305 --> 00:29:55.637
I'm sure you've heard
this before, Mr. Driscoll...

431
00:29:55.707 --> 00:29:57.174
if you don't mind me
saying...

432
00:29:57.242 --> 00:30:00.302
but you don't look at all
like your photograph.

433
00:30:05.484 --> 00:30:07.145
Excuse me.
Wait a minute, Ann...

434
00:30:07.252 --> 00:30:10.050
He's so much
younger in person.
And much better-looking.

435
00:30:10.122 --> 00:30:11.749
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

436
00:30:11.823 --> 00:30:13.984
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be...

437
00:30:14.059 --> 00:30:16.857
one of those
self-obsessed literary types.

438
00:30:17.362 --> 00:30:18.761
I'm sorry, I'm not...
You know...

439
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:22.561
the tweedy twerp
with his nose in his book
and his head up his a...

440
00:30:26.771 --> 00:30:29.467
It's nice to meet you, too,
Miss Darrow.

441
00:30:43.388 --> 00:30:44.787
Good Christ!

442
00:31:11.249 --> 00:31:13.217
She's standing
at the railing.

443
00:31:13.285 --> 00:31:14.775
She doesn't know it yet...

444
00:31:16.054 --> 00:31:19.512
But they are sailing
towards disaster.
You got that?

445
00:31:19.724 --> 00:31:21.453
Okay, so she turns...

446
00:31:22.761 --> 00:31:24.661
the first mate
is staggering towards her.

447
00:31:25.997 --> 00:31:28.591
There's a knife
sticking out of his back.

448
00:31:28.667 --> 00:31:31.602
Wait a sec. We're killing off
the first mate?

449
00:31:32.137 --> 00:31:34.332
That's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.

450
00:31:34.406 --> 00:31:37.239
Come on, Jack.
It was an honest mistake.

451
00:31:37.309 --> 00:31:39.869
Ann is nearsighted.
It could have happened
to anyone.

452
00:31:39.945 --> 00:31:41.537
I was joking, Carl.

453
00:31:41.613 --> 00:31:44.912
The point is,
she's horrified.
She has to look away.

454
00:31:47.652 --> 00:31:49.745
And that's when she sees it.

455
00:31:51.957 --> 00:31:53.322
Sees what?

456
00:31:54.593 --> 00:31:55.685
What?

457
00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:02.531
The island.

458
00:32:06.238 --> 00:32:10.641
We're filming on an island
now? When did this happen?

459
00:32:11.376 --> 00:32:13.810
Jack, keep your voice down.

460
00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:16.873
I don't want the crew
getting spooked.

461
00:32:17.482 --> 00:32:20.474
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

462
00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:22.576
All right.
It has a local name...

463
00:32:22.687 --> 00:32:25.178
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

464
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:27.986
They call it Skull Island.

465
00:32:28.126 --> 00:32:29.787
Did you get that?

466
00:32:30.595 --> 00:32:31.926
What's wrong
with this place?

467
00:32:31.997 --> 00:32:34.727
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.

468
00:32:34.933 --> 00:32:38.300
Because, technically,
it hasn't been
discovered yet.

469
00:32:40.705 --> 00:32:42.673
Okay. All right.

470
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:47.139
So we arrive at this place.

471
00:32:47.746 --> 00:32:48.940
S...

472
00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:50.775
K...

473
00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.215
U...

474
00:32:54.219 --> 00:32:55.379
L...

475
00:32:56.921 --> 00:32:58.183
L...

476
00:33:03.595 --> 00:33:04.960
Island.

477
00:33:09.267 --> 00:33:12.361
All right, everyone,
from the top! And action!

478
00:33:13.938 --> 00:33:17.601
I think this is
awfully exciting! I've never
been on a ship before.

479
00:33:17.676 --> 00:33:20.270
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.

480
00:33:20.345 --> 00:33:23.803
I guess you don't think
much of women
on ships, do you?

481
00:33:24.215 --> 00:33:25.842
No, they're a nuisance.

482
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:29.579
Well, I'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.

483
00:33:37.896 --> 00:33:38.954
Cut!

484
00:33:40.065 --> 00:33:41.430
It's great.

485
00:33:41.566 --> 00:33:45.798
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

486
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:48.771
That was very natural.
I felt moved.

487
00:33:48.907 --> 00:33:52.399
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some
flow now, huh?

488
00:33:52.477 --> 00:33:54.308
It was pure effluence.

489
00:33:54.379 --> 00:33:56.142
I beefed up the banter.

490
00:33:56.214 --> 00:33:58.341
Try to resist that impulse.

491
00:33:58.983 --> 00:34:00.575
It's just a little bit
of humor, bud.

492
00:34:00.685 --> 00:34:03.153
What are you,
a Bolshevik or something?

493
00:34:03.221 --> 00:34:04.415
Actors.

494
00:34:05.557 --> 00:34:08.856
Travel the world,
but all they ever see
is a mirror.

495
00:34:21.339 --> 00:34:22.670
Good legs.

496
00:34:24.342 --> 00:34:26.936
Sea legs.
Well, you know, sea legs.

497
00:34:29.547 --> 00:34:30.536
Yeah.

498
00:34:30.648 --> 00:34:34.243
Not that you don't
have good legs.
Just making conversation.

499
00:34:34.352 --> 00:34:36.650
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

500
00:34:38.623 --> 00:34:41.114
About the scene today
with you and Bruce...

501
00:34:41.226 --> 00:34:43.057
I know it wasn't
what you wrote...

502
00:34:43.128 --> 00:34:47.155
but Mr. Baxter
felt very strongly that
when a man likes a woman...

503
00:34:47.799 --> 00:34:49.460
he must ignore her.

504
00:34:49.534 --> 00:34:52.401
And if things turn
really hostile, then...

505
00:34:53.271 --> 00:34:54.465
No?

506
00:34:54.539 --> 00:34:56.268
Interesting theory.

507
00:34:56.975 --> 00:34:59.000
I know. I should have...

508
00:34:59.144 --> 00:35:01.305
It wasn't
what I had intended, but...

509
00:35:01.413 --> 00:35:02.937
I'm sorry. I was...

510
00:35:02.981 --> 00:35:04.972
And you made it your own.

511
00:35:05.984 --> 00:35:07.451
I was nervous.

512
00:35:07.685 --> 00:35:10.279
It was funny, actually.
You were funny.

513
00:35:11.256 --> 00:35:13.554
Please don't say
another word. Good night.

514
00:35:13.625 --> 00:35:15.024
Miss Darrow.

515
00:35:20.665 --> 00:35:22.860
You don't have to be nervous.

516
00:36:33.404 --> 00:36:34.735
Thank you.

517
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.267
Let's take it...

518
00:36:37.375 --> 00:36:39.673
Would you please...
We're trying to
shoot a scene.

519
00:36:39.744 --> 00:36:41.371
Okay.
Thank you.

520
00:36:41.779 --> 00:36:42.905
Okay, again.

521
00:36:57.495 --> 00:36:59.690
We're close. Turn southwest.

522
00:37:00.164 --> 00:37:03.258
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

523
00:37:05.203 --> 00:37:07.728
It takes us way outside
the shipping lanes.

524
00:37:07.805 --> 00:37:10.296
I won't sail blind
in these waters.

525
00:37:11.342 --> 00:37:13.572
I'll make it
worth your while.

526
00:37:14.879 --> 00:37:16.904
There's nothing out there.

527
00:37:17.649 --> 00:37:20.083
Well,
then you've nothing to lose.

528
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:36.089
If someone were to tell you
this ship was headed
for Singapore...

529
00:37:37.569 --> 00:37:39.298
what would you say?

530
00:37:39.404 --> 00:37:42.168
I would say they're
full of it, Mr. Hayes.

531
00:37:44.142 --> 00:37:46.667
Well, we turned southwest
last night.

532
00:37:46.878 --> 00:37:48.539
Gentlemen, please.

533
00:37:49.981 --> 00:37:52.472
We're not looking
for trouble.
No.

534
00:37:53.851 --> 00:37:56.251
You're looking
for something else.

535
00:37:59.624 --> 00:38:00.955
Yes, we are.

536
00:38:02.627 --> 00:38:04.993
We're going to find
Skull Island.

537
00:38:05.597 --> 00:38:08.430
Find it, film it,
and show it to the world.

538
00:38:09.434 --> 00:38:13.200
For 25 cents,
you get to see the last
blank space on the map.

539
00:38:13.605 --> 00:38:15.800
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

540
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:19.736
What do you mean?

541
00:38:20.478 --> 00:38:23.072
Seven years ago,
me and Mr. Hayes
were working our passage...

542
00:38:23.147 --> 00:38:24.705
on a Norwegian bark.

543
00:38:24.816 --> 00:38:27.649
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

544
00:38:27.919 --> 00:38:29.750
He'd been drifting for days.

545
00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:33.222
His ship had run aground
on an island
way west of Sumatra.

546
00:38:33.291 --> 00:38:36.749
An island hidden in fog.

547
00:38:38.529 --> 00:38:40.793
He spoke of a huge wall...

548
00:38:42.066 --> 00:38:43.829
built so long ago...

549
00:38:44.335 --> 00:38:46.360
no one knew who'd made it.

550
00:38:46.604 --> 00:38:49.505
A wall 100 foot high...

551
00:38:49.774 --> 00:38:52.607
as strong today
as it was ages ago.

552
00:38:54.379 --> 00:38:56.370
Why'd they build the wall?

553
00:39:00.785 --> 00:39:04.448
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...

554
00:39:04.889 --> 00:39:06.982
neither beast nor man...

555
00:39:07.492 --> 00:39:10.757
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

556
00:39:11.529 --> 00:39:13.156
A lion or a tiger.

557
00:39:14.132 --> 00:39:16.430
A man-eater. That's how
all these stories start.

558
00:39:16.501 --> 00:39:18.298
What else did he say?

559
00:39:18.636 --> 00:39:19.762
Nothing.

560
00:39:19.837 --> 00:39:22.601
We found him
the next morning. He'd stuck
a knife through his heart.

561
00:39:22.674 --> 00:39:23.936
Mmm-hmm.

562
00:39:24.108 --> 00:39:27.168
Sorry, fellows.
You'll have to do
better than that.

563
00:39:28.413 --> 00:39:30.677
Monsters belong in B movies.

564
00:39:30.782 --> 00:39:32.773
If you find this place...

565
00:39:33.317 --> 00:39:36.753
if you go ashore
with your friends
and your cameras...

566
00:39:37.922 --> 00:39:39.617
you won't come back.

567
00:39:40.591 --> 00:39:43.116
Just as long as
you understand that.

568
00:41:02.974 --> 00:41:05.841
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?

569
00:41:11.482 --> 00:41:13.677
You're writing a stage comedy?

570
00:41:13.851 --> 00:41:15.751
I'm writing it for you.

571
00:41:17.922 --> 00:41:19.787
Why would you do that?

572
00:41:20.725 --> 00:41:23.592
Why would I write
a play for you?
Yes.

573
00:41:25.229 --> 00:41:26.856
Isn't it obvious?

574
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.931
Not to me.

575
00:41:34.772 --> 00:41:35.966
Well...

576
00:41:37.508 --> 00:41:39.305
it's in the subtext.

577
00:41:42.046 --> 00:41:44.276
I guess
I must have missed it.

578
00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.217
It's not about words.

579
00:42:34.332 --> 00:42:36.323
Message for you, Captain.

580
00:42:54.752 --> 00:42:56.344
What's going on?

581
00:42:57.154 --> 00:42:59.987
Hayes,
why are we changing course?

582
00:43:01.492 --> 00:43:03.756
Englehorn, you can't just...
Outside.

583
00:43:07.832 --> 00:43:10.426
There's a warrant out
for your arrest.

584
00:43:10.768 --> 00:43:12.395
Did you know that?

585
00:43:14.839 --> 00:43:17.467
I've been ordered
to divert to Rangoon.

586
00:43:21.646 --> 00:43:24.945
Another week.
I haven't got a film yet.

587
00:43:26.284 --> 00:43:29.014
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

588
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.385
No, Denham.
You risked everything I have.

589
00:43:34.292 --> 00:43:35.554
What do you want?

590
00:43:35.626 --> 00:43:37.890
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

591
00:43:37.962 --> 00:43:39.896
I want you off my ship.

592
00:43:42.433 --> 00:43:44.958
Set a course for Rangoon,
Mr. Hayes.

593
00:43:51.575 --> 00:43:53.042
I'm finished.

594
00:43:54.512 --> 00:43:56.377
It's over for me, Jack.

595
00:43:58.149 --> 00:44:00.549
How'd you think
this would end, Carl?

596
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.736
Check our position.
Use the stars.

597
00:44:33.417 --> 00:44:35.510
There are no stars, Captain.

598
00:44:37.989 --> 00:44:39.388
What is that?

599
00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:43.452
What?
That.

600
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:49.092
That right there.

601
00:44:50.134 --> 00:44:52.898
I don't know.
What is it? A coffee stain?

602
00:46:31.202 --> 00:46:35.036
Station the forward lookout
and get me the depth
by lead line.

603
00:46:35.339 --> 00:46:36.806
Aye, Captain.

604
00:46:48.152 --> 00:46:50.245
30 fathoms, no bottom!

605
00:46:52.123 --> 00:46:55.092
Reduce speed,
steerage way only.

606
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.725
Dead slow ahead, both.

607
00:47:00.698 --> 00:47:02.689
You should stop the ship.

608
00:47:04.068 --> 00:47:05.865
15 degrees port.

609
00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:10.468
We're getting out of here,
Mr. Hayes.

610
00:47:10.541 --> 00:47:12.668
We'll find clear conditions.

611
00:47:13.344 --> 00:47:14.868
We have seabed!

612
00:47:20.651 --> 00:47:22.118
25 fathoms!

613
00:47:24.021 --> 00:47:25.488
We're shallowing!

614
00:47:25.556 --> 00:47:26.921
20 degrees starboard!

615
00:47:26.991 --> 00:47:29.050
Captain, you don't know
where the hell you're going!

616
00:47:29.126 --> 00:47:30.753
Get me another reading!

617
00:47:33.998 --> 00:47:35.590
Another reading!

618
00:47:38.135 --> 00:47:39.864
22 fathoms!

619
00:47:41.405 --> 00:47:43.464
Douse the lights.
Aye, Captain.

620
00:47:55.519 --> 00:47:56.918
10 fathoms!

621
00:48:08.432 --> 00:48:11.230
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

622
00:48:28.519 --> 00:48:29.986
Stop engines!

623
00:49:33.317 --> 00:49:35.080
Give me some power!
Half astern both.

624
00:49:35.185 --> 00:49:37.244
Half astern both, Captain!

625
00:49:41.859 --> 00:49:43.053
Rocks!

626
00:49:46.163 --> 00:49:47.323
Rocks!

627
00:49:51.902 --> 00:49:54.063
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

628
00:49:54.571 --> 00:49:56.937
To port! Rocks everywhere!

629
00:49:57.107 --> 00:49:58.699
Take the wheel, Hayes.

630
00:50:15.893 --> 00:50:17.121
Hang on!

631
00:50:40.617 --> 00:50:41.982
Full ahead!

632
00:50:47.791 --> 00:50:49.691
Rocks to port, Captain!

633
00:50:50.661 --> 00:50:53.425
Turn, Captain!
Starboard, starboard!

634
00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:14.078
Ah!

635
00:52:20.818 --> 00:52:22.376
Shore up that breach!

636
00:52:22.486 --> 00:52:25.751
Get me more men
down here now!
Come on, move, move!

637
00:52:27.791 --> 00:52:30.089
Hayes!
She's taken a pounding!

638
00:52:32.362 --> 00:52:33.795
What about the prop?

639
00:52:33.864 --> 00:52:36.059
The shaft's not bent,
as far as we can tell.

640
00:52:36.133 --> 00:52:38.363
But she struck hard
against the rock!

641
00:52:39.369 --> 00:52:40.597
Captain!

642
00:52:41.271 --> 00:52:43.034
Better come up quick!

643
00:52:44.908 --> 00:52:46.307
Right there!

644
00:53:01.091 --> 00:53:03.184
Want me to bring them back?

645
00:53:03.827 --> 00:53:05.522
I don't give a damn
about Carl Denham.

646
00:53:05.596 --> 00:53:09.088
I want this ship fixed
and ready to float
on the next high tide!

647
00:53:09.166 --> 00:53:10.793
Come on, move it.

648
00:53:11.969 --> 00:53:13.960
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.

649
00:53:21.378 --> 00:53:23.471
Can you believe this, Jack?

650
00:53:26.817 --> 00:53:28.682
We've got our picture.

651
00:54:26.276 --> 00:54:28.972
Why does Marlow
keep going up the river?

652
00:54:30.347 --> 00:54:32.338
Why doesn't he turn back?

653
00:54:34.818 --> 00:54:37.651
There's a part of him
that wants to, Jimmy.

654
00:54:38.989 --> 00:54:42.152
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

655
00:54:43.961 --> 00:54:46.054
But there's another part...

656
00:54:47.197 --> 00:54:48.926
that needs to know.

657
00:54:52.169 --> 00:54:55.002
To defeat the thing
which makes him afraid.

658
00:54:56.873 --> 00:55:00.172
"We could not understand
because we were too far..."

659
00:55:00.978 --> 00:55:02.172
"and could not remember..."

660
00:55:02.245 --> 00:55:05.772
"because we were traveling
in the night of first ages..."

661
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:08.948
"of those ages
that are gone..."

662
00:55:10.153 --> 00:55:12.849
"leaving hardly a sign,
and no memories."

663
00:55:15.726 --> 00:55:16.954
"We are accustomed to look..."

664
00:55:17.027 --> 00:55:20.190
"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster..."

665
00:55:22.666 --> 00:55:24.156
"but there..."

666
00:55:25.535 --> 00:55:29.301
"there you could look
at a thing
monstrous and free."

667
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:41.544
It's not
an adventure story...

668
00:55:42.152 --> 00:55:43.744
is it, Mr. Hayes?

669
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:47.120
No, Jimmy.

670
00:55:48.225 --> 00:55:49.624
It's not.

671
00:56:12.082 --> 00:56:14.482
It's deserted.
Of course it's deserted.

672
00:56:14.551 --> 00:56:17.987
Use your eyes, Preston.
The place is a ruin.

673
00:56:19.423 --> 00:56:22.221
Nobody's lived here
for hundreds of years.

674
00:57:36.099 --> 00:57:38.590
Mr. Denham,
I think we should go back.

675
00:57:38.668 --> 00:57:40.397
I will handle this.

676
00:57:45.842 --> 00:57:47.469
Look. Chocolate.

677
00:57:48.712 --> 00:57:50.441
You like chocolate?

678
00:57:53.283 --> 00:57:54.910
It's good to eat.

679
00:57:57.287 --> 00:57:58.549
You want?

680
00:58:04.494 --> 00:58:05.722
Take it.

681
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:15.836
Here, put it in your hand
and take it.

682
00:58:21.912 --> 00:58:24.346
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.

683
00:58:24.414 --> 00:58:26.712
She doesn't want
the chocolate.

684
00:58:28.718 --> 00:58:29.912
Aah!

685
00:58:51.975 --> 00:58:53.340
All right!

686
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:56.201
Just a bunch of women
and old folks!

687
00:58:58.014 --> 00:58:59.641
They're harmless!

688
01:00:21.398 --> 01:00:22.456
Ann!

689
01:01:49.986 --> 01:01:51.044
Jack.

690
01:02:05.235 --> 01:02:06.634
Seen enough?

691
01:02:14.477 --> 01:02:16.138
Lighten the ship!

692
01:02:16.646 --> 01:02:20.309
Anything that's not
bolted down goes overboard!

693
01:02:22.685 --> 01:02:24.152
Just heave it!

694
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:25.949
We got away.

695
01:02:26.022 --> 01:02:27.751
We gotta be grateful
for that, gentlemen.

696
01:02:27.824 --> 01:02:31.590
What about Mike?
He didn't get away!
He's still there!

697
01:02:32.295 --> 01:02:35.594
Mike died doing
what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing.

698
01:02:35.665 --> 01:02:39.726
And I'll tell you
something else. I'm gonna
finish this film for Mike!

699
01:02:46.176 --> 01:02:47.803
I'll finish it...

700
01:02:49.712 --> 01:02:52.010
and I'll donate
the proceeds...

701
01:02:52.749 --> 01:02:54.512
to his wife and kids.

702
01:02:54.984 --> 01:02:58.511
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

703
01:02:59.389 --> 01:03:00.686
Hear, hear!

704
01:03:39.229 --> 01:03:41.629
Chuck everything
except for the potatoes!

705
01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:50.003
What's wrong now?
Excuse me, Shakespeare.

706
01:03:50.507 --> 01:03:52.873
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

707
01:04:04.087 --> 01:04:07.488
Drop those
spare cables overboard!
Go on, just chuck it!

708
01:04:25.909 --> 01:04:27.069
Where's Ann?
What?

709
01:04:27.143 --> 01:04:28.303
Where's Ann?

710
01:04:33.716 --> 01:04:34.683
Ann!

711
01:04:54.504 --> 01:04:55.835
She's free!

712
01:05:02.111 --> 01:05:04.705
Full ahead, both engines!

713
01:05:12.021 --> 01:05:13.454
Ann!

714
01:05:35.545 --> 01:05:38.946
No! Stop! Turn back!

715
01:05:40.316 --> 01:05:41.510
Stop!

716
01:05:43.453 --> 01:05:45.250
We have to turn back.

717
01:05:45.455 --> 01:05:47.116
They've taken Ann.

718
01:05:59.535 --> 01:06:02.561
Kong! Kong! Kong!

719
01:06:44.781 --> 01:06:48.717
All hands going ashore!
Report to stations!

720
01:06:50.019 --> 01:06:52.453
Jump to it!
Jump to it, gentlemen!

721
01:06:56.125 --> 01:06:57.854
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!

722
01:07:05.101 --> 01:07:06.864
Come on, move it!

723
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.547
Pull harder!

724
01:07:26.923 --> 01:07:28.823
Row! Row!

725
01:07:29.025 --> 01:07:30.219
Come on!

726
01:08:17.006 --> 01:08:18.132
Kong.

727
01:10:40.616 --> 01:10:42.379
Spread out! Find her!

728
01:10:51.227 --> 01:10:52.592
Miss Darrow!

729
01:10:52.795 --> 01:10:55.593
Check up there, Jimmy!
Everybody stay together!

730
01:10:59.035 --> 01:11:00.059
Ann!

731
01:11:02.138 --> 01:11:03.901
She's here somewhere!

732
01:11:08.611 --> 01:11:10.442
What in God's name was that?

733
01:11:16.852 --> 01:11:18.410
Behind the wall!

734
01:11:19.188 --> 01:11:20.746
Behind the wall!

735
01:12:12.408 --> 01:12:13.773
She's gone!

736
01:12:24.787 --> 01:12:26.550
Carl, what is it?

737
01:12:33.195 --> 01:12:34.856
You saw something.

738
01:12:42.038 --> 01:12:44.836
You can take Hayes
and 15 others.

739
01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:48.305
I'll put a guard on the gate
until you return.

740
01:12:48.377 --> 01:12:50.868
The rest of you
stay with the ship.

741
01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.072
Choy!

742
01:12:53.883 --> 01:12:55.407
Not you, Jimmy.

743
01:12:55.551 --> 01:12:57.644
Come on, Mr. Hayes.
Look at them.

744
01:12:57.753 --> 01:12:59.516
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

745
01:12:59.588 --> 01:13:00.850
Stay here.

746
01:13:01.357 --> 01:13:03.825
Miss Darrow needs me!
No!

747
01:13:08.698 --> 01:13:11.064
Bring the tripod
and all of the film stock.

748
01:13:11.133 --> 01:13:13.567
You wanna go
with the 6-inch lens?

749
01:13:14.036 --> 01:13:16.436
The wide-angle
will do just fine.

750
01:13:22.445 --> 01:13:25.380
You got guns. You got food.
You got the ammo.

751
01:13:25.881 --> 01:13:27.644
And you got 24 hours!

752
01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:29.583
24 hours?

753
01:13:29.819 --> 01:13:31.946
This time tomorrow,
we haul anchor.

754
01:13:55.444 --> 01:13:56.968
Miss Darrow!

755
01:13:59.381 --> 01:14:00.405
Ann!

756
01:14:03.853 --> 01:14:05.252
Miss Darrow!

757
01:14:14.163 --> 01:14:15.562
Miss Darrow!

758
01:14:20.603 --> 01:14:22.002
Miss Darrow!

759
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:27.767
Ann!

760
01:15:43.352 --> 01:15:44.319
No!

761
01:16:02.004 --> 01:16:04.199
Ann!
Miss Darrow!

762
01:16:12.848 --> 01:16:13.872
Ann!

763
01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:03.730
Christ,
it's a bleeding boneyard!

764
01:17:05.134 --> 01:17:07.602
They've been ripped
limb from limb.

765
01:17:09.438 --> 01:17:11.872
Ann! Ann!

766
01:17:25.154 --> 01:17:27.418
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes.
Pretend you didn't see me.

767
01:17:27.489 --> 01:17:29.457
Jesus, Jimmy.
Hey, I need that!

768
01:17:29.558 --> 01:17:30.786
I'm not giving you a gun!

769
01:17:30.859 --> 01:17:32.884
You were younger than me
when they gave you one!

770
01:17:32.962 --> 01:17:36.523
I was in the army.
I was trained.
I had a drill sergeant.

771
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.127
I wanna help bring her back.

772
01:17:47.977 --> 01:17:49.945
Don't make me regret it.

773
01:18:17.239 --> 01:18:19.230
Conserve your ammunition!

774
01:18:28.617 --> 01:18:30.084
I'm knackered.

775
01:18:32.421 --> 01:18:34.446
I can't breathe.
I need a breather.

776
01:18:34.556 --> 01:18:36.023
Fellows, we don't have
time for this.

777
01:18:36.091 --> 01:18:38.559
We've lost too much ground
already. Come on, get up!

778
01:18:38.627 --> 01:18:42.063
They're not about to
quit on you.
Cut them some slack.

779
01:18:42.197 --> 01:18:44.529
All right,
you got five minutes!

780
01:18:44.767 --> 01:18:46.701
Everybody stay in sight.

781
01:18:50.706 --> 01:18:54.142
Over here. I'm gonna get
a wide shot of the valley.

782
01:19:24.339 --> 01:19:25.704
Bloody Nora!

783
01:19:32.881 --> 01:19:35.076
Is that
what took Miss Darrow?

784
01:19:38.687 --> 01:19:42.817
There's only one creature
capable of leaving
a footprint that size.

785
01:19:49.264 --> 01:19:51.164
The abominable snowman.

786
01:19:52.768 --> 01:19:55.464
Yeah, a snowman.
We dead meat.

787
01:19:56.171 --> 01:19:58.571
It's got to be what,
20, 25 feet?

788
01:20:00.676 --> 01:20:02.109
Carl saw it.

789
01:20:03.512 --> 01:20:05.002
Let's ask him.

790
01:20:07.149 --> 01:20:08.309
Denham!

791
01:20:10.919 --> 01:20:12.181
Where'd he go?

792
01:20:32.407 --> 01:20:34.170
Walk forward, Bruce.

793
01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:36.507
What?
You're the star
of this picture.

794
01:20:36.578 --> 01:20:39.638
Get into character
and head toward the animals.

795
01:20:45.821 --> 01:20:48.415
What the hell
kind of a place is this?

796
01:20:58.634 --> 01:21:00.898
Are you sure about this,
Denham?

797
01:21:01.403 --> 01:21:03.462
Don't we have a stand-in
for this type of thing?

798
01:21:03.539 --> 01:21:06.474
I need you in the shot,
or people will say
they're fake.

799
01:21:06.542 --> 01:21:08.737
Nobody's gonna think
these are fake.

800
01:21:17.452 --> 01:21:19.420
You're making them nervous.
No sudden movements.

801
01:21:19.521 --> 01:21:20.818
I'm not moving.

802
01:21:26.595 --> 01:21:28.927
Mother of God.

803
01:21:50.919 --> 01:21:52.284
What's this?

804
01:22:18.447 --> 01:22:19.914
What is it? What is it?
Where's Carl?

805
01:22:19.982 --> 01:22:22.780
Carl?
He's up there, filming.

806
01:22:33.262 --> 01:22:34.661
Bugger this!

807
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:43.867
Run, Jack!

808
01:22:46.675 --> 01:22:49.200
Holy Christ.
Go, Jimmy, run!

809
01:22:50.112 --> 01:22:51.602
Run, run, run!

810
01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.078
Let go!
I'm not leaving the camera!

811
01:23:00.188 --> 01:23:01.416
Let go, you idiot!

812
01:23:01.523 --> 01:23:03.354
Carl, run!

813
01:23:16.772 --> 01:23:18.034
Get down.

814
01:23:18.874 --> 01:23:19.898
Look out!

815
01:24:10.192 --> 01:24:11.716
Coming through!

816
01:25:16.024 --> 01:25:17.048
No!

817
01:26:00.168 --> 01:26:02.830
Carl! Carl!

818
01:26:06.007 --> 01:26:08.532
Get up! Come on. Come on.

819
01:26:23.425 --> 01:26:26.087
Mr. Denham! Mr. Denham!

820
01:26:26.795 --> 01:26:29.389
Herb! Herb, come on!

821
01:26:29.464 --> 01:26:31.193
Take the tripod!

822
01:26:31.433 --> 01:26:32.661
Come on!

823
01:26:33.869 --> 01:26:36.429
I'm pulling you up!
Hold on to your end!

824
01:26:36.505 --> 01:26:37.529
Go!

825
01:26:37.606 --> 01:26:39.301
No, I'm not going anywhere
without you!

826
01:26:39.975 --> 01:26:42.637
You gotta leave me!
Shut up and hold on!

827
01:27:50.378 --> 01:27:52.107
Jimmy, do a head count.

828
01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:54.705
I want to know how many
are injured and how bad.

829
01:27:54.816 --> 01:27:56.044
Injured?

830
01:27:57.485 --> 01:27:59.248
Four of us are dead!

831
01:28:05.894 --> 01:28:07.657
It's not your fault.

832
01:28:08.096 --> 01:28:10.792
What happened to Herb
is no one's fault.

833
01:28:11.266 --> 01:28:13.666
You're absolutely right,
Preston.

834
01:28:14.069 --> 01:28:16.469
And I'll tell you
something else.

835
01:28:16.538 --> 01:28:18.836
Herbert didn't die
for nothing.

836
01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.038
He died for
what he believed in,
and I'm gonna honor that.

837
01:28:22.110 --> 01:28:26.171
He died believing
there was still some mystery
left in this world.

838
01:28:26.681 --> 01:28:29.241
And we could all
have a piece of it...

839
01:28:29.484 --> 01:28:31.975
for the price
of an admission ticket.

840
01:28:32.253 --> 01:28:35.950
God damn it, Preston,
we're gonna finish this film
for Herb.

841
01:28:36.358 --> 01:28:38.019
We'll finish it...

842
01:28:38.126 --> 01:28:41.027
and donate the proceeds
to his wife and kids.

843
01:28:42.664 --> 01:28:44.655
All right, we gotta
get back to the ship.

844
01:28:44.733 --> 01:28:48.430
Englehorn sails
in nine hours.
So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.

845
01:28:48.503 --> 01:28:50.971
Hey, do you hear me?
We're gonna be
stranded here.

846
01:28:51.039 --> 01:28:54.440
Look, fellows,
Miss Darrow was a great gal,
no question.

847
01:28:54.509 --> 01:28:56.238
And she was
a wonderful person.

848
01:28:56.311 --> 01:28:59.542
It's a terrible loss
and we're all gonna miss her.

849
01:28:59.848 --> 01:29:03.716
I always knew you were
nothing like the tough guy
you play on screen.

850
01:29:03.818 --> 01:29:05.513
I just never figured you
for a coward.

851
01:29:05.587 --> 01:29:07.680
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

852
01:29:08.256 --> 01:29:10.724
Heroes don't look like me,
not in the real world.

853
01:29:10.792 --> 01:29:14.353
In the real world,
they got bad teeth,
a bald spot, and a beer gut.

854
01:29:14.429 --> 01:29:17.956
I'm just an actor with a gun,
who's lost his motivation.

855
01:29:19.401 --> 01:29:20.891
Be seeing you.

856
01:29:22.137 --> 01:29:23.502
Anyone else?

857
01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.008
Well, see you.
Come on.

858
01:34:23.771 --> 01:34:24.965
No!

859
01:34:25.673 --> 01:34:27.106
I said no!

860
01:34:34.615 --> 01:34:38.142
That's all there is.
There isn't any more.

861
01:36:35.169 --> 01:36:36.295
What is it?

862
01:36:41.075 --> 01:36:42.372
Mr. Hayes?

863
01:36:45.947 --> 01:36:48.541
If anything happens,
I want you to run.

864
01:36:49.083 --> 01:36:50.311
You understand?

865
01:36:50.918 --> 01:36:53.887
I'm not a coward.
I ain't gonna run.

866
01:36:55.423 --> 01:36:57.391
It's not about
being brave, Jimmy.

867
01:37:25.987 --> 01:37:26.976
Go back!

868
01:37:29.056 --> 01:37:30.455
Back across the log!

869
01:37:30.658 --> 01:37:33.218
I ain't gonna run!
Get Jimmy out of here!

870
01:37:33.461 --> 01:37:34.758
No!
Get back! Get back!

871
01:37:39.667 --> 01:37:40.998
Move back!

872
01:37:53.981 --> 01:37:56.211
No! No!
Stay back.

873
01:37:58.953 --> 01:37:59.977
No!

874
01:38:05.226 --> 01:38:06.523
Look at me.

875
01:38:08.763 --> 01:38:11.323
Let him go!
You got to run, Jimmy.

876
01:38:15.503 --> 01:38:16.868
Do as I say.

877
01:38:18.206 --> 01:38:19.605
Go with Jack.

878
01:38:22.043 --> 01:38:23.101
Run!

879
01:38:26.647 --> 01:38:29.047
No!
Shoot him!

880
01:38:30.618 --> 01:38:31.585
No!

881
01:38:46.667 --> 01:38:49.465
Here! Over here!

882
01:39:07.555 --> 01:39:09.523
Hold on! Hold on!

883
01:39:13.628 --> 01:39:15.892
Lumpy! Help me!

884
01:39:18.132 --> 01:39:19.531
Bloody hell, Choy!

885
01:44:41.555 --> 01:44:42.579
No!

886
01:44:46.794 --> 01:44:47.988
Oh, my!

887
01:51:23.457 --> 01:51:24.754
Wait!

888
01:52:14.207 --> 01:52:15.333
Carl.

889
01:52:20.414 --> 01:52:22.006
Jimmy. Jimmy.

890
01:52:22.916 --> 01:52:23.883
Jimmy.

891
01:52:25.018 --> 01:52:26.144
You all right?

892
01:53:16.103 --> 01:53:17.365
No.

893
01:54:09.623 --> 01:54:11.614
Get off! Get it off!

894
01:54:19.199 --> 01:54:20.223
Get off!

895
01:54:34.114 --> 01:54:35.206
Get it off!

896
01:55:41.147 --> 01:55:42.273
Kill it!

897
01:55:54.394 --> 01:55:55.793
Stop moving!

898
01:56:15.815 --> 01:56:17.510
Get it off my face!

899
01:56:18.518 --> 01:56:20.918
Stay still.
I am standing still.

900
01:56:23.423 --> 01:56:25.220
Hold on.
Be careful!

901
01:57:00.093 --> 01:57:02.653
Don't move!
Stay away from the walls!

902
01:57:03.330 --> 01:57:04.854
Coming through!

903
01:57:13.306 --> 01:57:15.900
Get out of there now! Climb!

904
02:00:07.113 --> 02:00:08.637
It's beautiful.

905
02:00:30.136 --> 02:00:31.467
Beautiful.

906
02:00:42.982 --> 02:00:44.279
Beautiful.

907
02:01:31.698 --> 02:01:32.892
There.

908
02:01:35.969 --> 02:01:37.061
Thank God.

909
02:01:37.136 --> 02:01:39.104
Don't thank God.
Thank Mr. Baxter.

910
02:01:39.205 --> 02:01:41.173
He insisted on
a rescue mission.

911
02:01:42.508 --> 02:01:45.966
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

912
02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.544
That's the thing
about cockroaches.

913
02:01:49.649 --> 02:01:53.085
No matter how many times
you flush them
down the toilet...

914
02:01:53.152 --> 02:01:55.620
they always crawl
back up the bowl.

915
02:01:56.589 --> 02:01:59.422
Hey, buddy?
I'm out of the bowl.

916
02:02:00.193 --> 02:02:02.787
I'm dryin' off my wings
and trekkin' across the lid.

917
02:02:10.737 --> 02:02:11.965
Driscoll!

918
02:02:13.439 --> 02:02:17.102
Don't be a fool!
Give it up. It's useless!

919
02:02:18.378 --> 02:02:19.743
She's dead.

920
02:02:22.582 --> 02:02:24.106
She's not dead.

921
02:02:28.054 --> 02:02:30.284
Jack's gonna bring her back...

922
02:02:31.257 --> 02:02:33.851
and the ape will be
hard on his heels.

923
02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:37.085
We can still
come out of this thing okay.

924
02:02:39.699 --> 02:02:41.257
More than okay.

925
02:02:42.502 --> 02:02:44.060
Think about it.

926
02:02:44.137 --> 02:02:46.970
You got a boat
full of chloroform
we could put to good use.

927
02:02:47.907 --> 02:02:49.807
You wanna trap the ape?

928
02:02:56.683 --> 02:02:58.275
I don't think so.

929
02:02:58.885 --> 02:03:02.252
Isn't that what you do?
Live animal capture?

930
02:03:03.756 --> 02:03:05.519
I heard you were the best.

931
02:03:13.633 --> 02:03:14.759
Jack!

932
02:03:17.837 --> 02:03:19.600
Look after yourself!

933
02:03:20.239 --> 02:03:21.866
Keep the gate open, will you?

934
02:03:22.241 --> 02:03:23.640
Sure thing, buddy.

935
02:03:24.677 --> 02:03:26.008
Good luck!

936
02:03:39.325 --> 02:03:40.690
I'm sorry.

937
02:06:19.518 --> 02:06:20.542
Ann.

938
02:07:29.121 --> 02:07:30.179
Jack!

939
02:07:31.090 --> 02:07:32.182
Run!

940
02:08:02.455 --> 02:08:04.082
Jack, Jack!

941
02:08:11.797 --> 02:08:12.957
Jack.

942
02:08:22.008 --> 02:08:23.976
Ann, it's okay.

943
02:08:24.810 --> 02:08:27.210
Ann, let's go.
Let's go. Come on!

944
02:08:40.526 --> 02:08:41.891
Let's go. Come on.

945
02:08:42.628 --> 02:08:43.856
Come on!

946
02:10:16.155 --> 02:10:17.213
Carl!

947
02:10:17.423 --> 02:10:20.119
Please! Somebody help us!

948
02:10:22.261 --> 02:10:23.728
They've gone.

949
02:10:25.297 --> 02:10:27.356
Carl. Christ.

950
02:10:27.933 --> 02:10:29.025
Carl!

951
02:10:29.869 --> 02:10:32.030
Drop the bridge.
Do it now, for Christ's sake!

952
02:10:32.104 --> 02:10:33.332
Not yet.

953
02:10:34.773 --> 02:10:35.865
Wait.

954
02:10:36.542 --> 02:10:37.634
Wait.

955
02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:42.872
Wait!

956
02:10:53.626 --> 02:10:54.854
Come on!

957
02:12:07.266 --> 02:12:08.756
Now!
Throw them!

958
02:12:08.834 --> 02:12:10.233
Throw!

959
02:12:11.103 --> 02:12:12.127
No!

960
02:12:14.506 --> 02:12:15.734
Hold him!

961
02:12:15.808 --> 02:12:17.298
Are you out of your mind?

962
02:12:26.051 --> 02:12:28.144
Stop!
Hold the line!

963
02:12:28.921 --> 02:12:30.320
Keep him down!

964
02:12:35.894 --> 02:12:36.883
Heave!

965
02:12:37.930 --> 02:12:39.261
Please!

966
02:12:39.732 --> 02:12:41.427
No! Stop!

967
02:12:41.767 --> 02:12:42.756
Jack.

968
02:12:43.836 --> 02:12:45.098
No.
Get her out of...

969
02:12:45.170 --> 02:12:47.070
They'll kill him!
There's nothing we can do.

970
02:12:47.139 --> 02:12:49.107
No!
Get her out of his sight!

971
02:12:49.174 --> 02:12:51.108
It's too late.
Throw it!

972
02:12:53.379 --> 02:12:54.471
Look out!

973
02:12:56.815 --> 02:12:58.282
Let go of me.

974
02:13:02.354 --> 02:13:03.946
We gotta go. Come on.

975
02:13:04.556 --> 02:13:05.750
Come on.
Stop it.

976
02:13:05.824 --> 02:13:07.348
Leave me alone!

977
02:13:08.527 --> 02:13:10.051
Ann, please come on.

978
02:13:17.369 --> 02:13:19.200
Kill it!
No. No!

979
02:13:19.405 --> 02:13:21.669
It's over,
you goddamn lunatic!

980
02:13:23.876 --> 02:13:25.400
All of you, run!

981
02:13:25.477 --> 02:13:26.842
Come on. Come on!

982
02:13:35.054 --> 02:13:36.646
Move it! Move it!

983
02:13:39.058 --> 02:13:40.423
Come on, come on!

984
02:13:49.335 --> 02:13:50.962
Stay there!
It's me he wants!

985
02:13:51.036 --> 02:13:53.231
Please stop this!
Move! Hold onto her!

986
02:13:53.305 --> 02:13:55.967
Ann, go.
Please, I can stop this!

987
02:13:56.041 --> 02:13:57.565
No!
Ann, stay there!

988
02:14:00.045 --> 02:14:01.376
Get it out!

989
02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:05.980
Get the hell out of here!

990
02:14:06.085 --> 02:14:08.053
Come on!
Jimmy, don't be crazy!
Come on.

991
02:14:08.153 --> 02:14:09.450
Don't be crazy.

992
02:14:10.656 --> 02:14:11.748
Let me go!

993
02:14:13.092 --> 02:14:14.559
Cast off!

994
02:14:16.862 --> 02:14:18.124
Come on, Carl!

995
02:14:19.598 --> 02:14:21.429
Row!
Wait.

996
02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:23.827
Row, God damn it!

997
02:14:34.079 --> 02:14:35.205
Go back.

998
02:14:42.154 --> 02:14:43.246
Jimmy, no!

999
02:14:50.262 --> 02:14:51.251
No!

1000
02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:10.111
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

1001
02:15:10.215 --> 02:15:11.705
Hide out in the back!

1002
02:15:34.306 --> 02:15:35.933
Wait!
No!

1003
02:15:36.642 --> 02:15:39.236
No! No! Please don't!

1004
02:17:37.462 --> 02:17:39.987
The whole world
will pay to see this.

1005
02:17:42.734 --> 02:17:44.725
We're millionaires, boys!

1006
02:17:45.037 --> 02:17:46.937
I'll share it with all of you!

1007
02:17:47.773 --> 02:17:52.267
In a few months
his name will be up
in lights on Broadway!

1008
02:17:54.446 --> 02:17:58.542
Kong!
The Eighth Wonder
of the World!

1009
02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:03.805
What can I say?
What can I say?

1010
02:19:03.915 --> 02:19:05.314
Any comments, sir?

1011
02:19:06.652 --> 02:19:08.244
The Mayor, thank you.

1012
02:19:09.488 --> 02:19:10.455
Ready.

1013
02:19:10.656 --> 02:19:11.987
What am I?

1014
02:19:12.391 --> 02:19:14.120
Thank you very much.

1015
02:19:17.963 --> 02:19:19.453
Get used to it.

1016
02:19:19.665 --> 02:19:21.326
Listen, great to see you.
Ready?

1017
02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:22.867
I'm really
appreciating that...

1018
02:19:22.934 --> 02:19:24.401
Look at you!
I remember you.

1019
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:27.461
You're a lucky guy, Denham.
Am I a lucky guy?

1020
02:19:27.539 --> 02:19:29.336
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

1021
02:19:43.188 --> 02:19:44.348
Carl!

1022
02:19:46.224 --> 02:19:47.418
Zelman!
I told you.

1023
02:19:47.492 --> 02:19:48.959
I know you did
and I appreciate it.

1024
02:19:49.027 --> 02:19:51.018
Let's get a shot of this.

1025
02:19:51.496 --> 02:19:52.622
Come on.

1026
02:19:53.365 --> 02:19:55.697
Big smile.
Yeah! That's great!

1027
02:19:58.070 --> 02:20:01.005
Look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.

1028
02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:04.265
No woman is worth this.
This woman is worth it.

1029
02:20:04.342 --> 02:20:06.333
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.

1030
02:20:06.411 --> 02:20:07.639
Oh, really?

1031
02:20:07.713 --> 02:20:09.374
She's not gonna buy this
for a second.

1032
02:20:09.448 --> 02:20:11.643
Shut up and hand me
the grapefruit!

1033
02:20:13.819 --> 02:20:16.447
You're writing a comedy?
Yes, I am.

1034
02:20:17.222 --> 02:20:19.156
I'm writing it for you.

1035
02:20:21.093 --> 02:20:22.958
Why would you do that?

1036
02:20:23.962 --> 02:20:26.362
Why would I write
a play for you?

1037
02:20:29.768 --> 02:20:31.395
Isn't it obvious?

1038
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:33.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

1039
02:20:34.406 --> 02:20:36.271
I couldn't help but overhear.

1040
02:20:39.778 --> 02:20:42.508
So, he took me to this
fancy French restaurant...

1041
02:20:42.581 --> 02:20:45.379
and halfway through
the hors d'oeuvres,
he clutches my hand.

1042
02:20:45.484 --> 02:20:47.645
And that's when he told you
how he felt?

1043
02:20:47.753 --> 02:20:50.483
No. He never said it.
He never said it?

1044
02:20:50.555 --> 02:20:52.523
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.

1045
02:20:52.591 --> 02:20:54.616
Well, then how does she know
that it's real?

1046
02:20:54.693 --> 02:20:58.151
He said it was
not about the words.
Oh, please!

1047
02:20:58.363 --> 02:21:02.424
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.

1048
02:21:02.801 --> 02:21:07.101
He said we'd talk
about it later.
Only there was no later.

1049
02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:10.398
It never happened.

1050
02:21:11.409 --> 02:21:13.172
That's how it ended.

1051
02:21:13.311 --> 02:21:17.042
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?

1052
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:22.317
I honestly believed
things might actually
work out...

1053
02:21:23.421 --> 02:21:25.389
which was really very...

1054
02:21:28.693 --> 02:21:29.921
foolish.

1055
02:21:30.162 --> 02:21:32.790
Men.
Oh, they'll give you
the world...

1056
02:21:32.864 --> 02:21:35.264
but they let the one thing
that truly matters...

1057
02:21:35.333 --> 02:21:37.233
slip through their fingers.

1058
02:21:37.302 --> 02:21:38.530
Typical.

1059
02:21:39.137 --> 02:21:42.800
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use
their brains.

1060
02:21:43.775 --> 02:21:45.675
Romance. Who needs it?

1061
02:22:10.402 --> 02:22:11.733
Thank you.

1062
02:22:12.571 --> 02:22:13.936
Thank you.

1063
02:22:16.875 --> 02:22:18.206
Thank you.

1064
02:22:20.011 --> 02:22:21.376
Thank you.

1065
02:22:23.181 --> 02:22:24.671
Ladies and gentlemen...

1066
02:22:26.284 --> 02:22:28.752
I'm here to tell you
a very strange story.

1067
02:22:29.554 --> 02:22:31.283
The story of our adventure...

1068
02:22:32.123 --> 02:22:35.092
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths...

1069
02:22:36.061 --> 02:22:37.551
their lives lost...

1070
02:22:38.330 --> 02:22:40.423
in pursuit of
a savage beast...

1071
02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:44.194
a monstrous aberration
of nature.

1072
02:22:45.437 --> 02:22:47.564
But even the meanest brute
can be tamed.

1073
02:22:48.306 --> 02:22:50.604
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
as you will see...

1074
02:22:51.076 --> 02:22:52.737
the beast was no match...

1075
02:22:53.345 --> 02:22:54.903
for the charms of a girl.

1076
02:22:58.416 --> 02:22:59.974
A girl from New York...

1077
02:23:03.154 --> 02:23:04.951
Who melted his heart...

1078
02:23:05.657 --> 02:23:08.251
bringing to mind
that old Arabian proverb...

1079
02:23:10.195 --> 02:23:13.358
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty..."

1080
02:23:14.399 --> 02:23:16.299
"and beauty stayed his hand."

1081
02:23:17.602 --> 02:23:21.470
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."

1082
02:23:29.281 --> 02:23:32.717
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you...

1083
02:23:32.884 --> 02:23:35.853
the greatest thing
your eyes have ever beheld.

1084
02:23:37.022 --> 02:23:41.686
He was a king in the world
he knew, but he comes to you
now a captive.

1085
02:23:42.894 --> 02:23:44.555
Ladies and gentlemen...

1086
02:23:44.629 --> 02:23:49.157
I give you Kong,
The Eighth Wonder
of the World!

1087
02:23:58.543 --> 02:24:01.603
Don't be alarmed.
It's perfectly safe.

1088
02:24:01.913 --> 02:24:05.371
These chains are made
of chrome steel!

1089
02:24:26.137 --> 02:24:27.934
Observe, if you will...

1090
02:24:31.209 --> 02:24:33.177
I am touching the beast.

1091
02:24:33.478 --> 02:24:37.710
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.

1092
02:24:44.889 --> 02:24:46.516
Crank 'em up, fellas.

1093
02:25:05.777 --> 02:25:07.972
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight...

1094
02:25:08.046 --> 02:25:09.673
a surprise guest.

1095
02:25:10.515 --> 02:25:12.676
The real-life hero
of this story.

1096
02:25:13.118 --> 02:25:15.552
The man who hunted down
the mighty Kong!

1097
02:25:17.222 --> 02:25:21.989
The man who risked all
to win the freedom
of a helpless female.

1098
02:25:23.161 --> 02:25:25.493
A big hand for
Mr. Bruce Baxter!

1099
02:25:31.369 --> 02:25:33.428
Thank you. Thank you.

1100
02:25:34.105 --> 02:25:35.265
Thank you.

1101
02:26:02.934 --> 02:26:04.367
He was right.

1102
02:26:05.937 --> 02:26:08.735
About there still being some
mystery left in this world...

1103
02:26:09.908 --> 02:26:12.206
and we can all have
a piece of it...

1104
02:26:12.577 --> 02:26:14.841
for the price
of an admission ticket.

1105
02:26:16.414 --> 02:26:18.712
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.

1106
02:26:20.852 --> 02:26:24.253
His unfailing ability
to destroy the things
he loves.

1107
02:26:38.703 --> 02:26:41.297
Please remain calm,
ladies and gentlemen...

1108
02:26:41.372 --> 02:26:44.671
for we now come
to the climax of
this savage ritual.

1109
02:26:44.876 --> 02:26:47.367
The sacrifice
of a beautiful young girl.

1110
02:26:48.146 --> 02:26:51.775
Behold her terror as she is
offered up to the mighty Kong!

1111
02:26:53.051 --> 02:26:57.078
A big hand, folks,
for the bravest girl
I've ever met!

1112
02:26:57.856 --> 02:26:59.118
Miss Ann Darrow.

1113
02:27:47.071 --> 02:27:48.800
Save me from the beast!

1114
02:27:57.715 --> 02:27:58.909
Help me!

1115
02:28:03.021 --> 02:28:04.318
Where is she?

1116
02:28:05.490 --> 02:28:07.014
Where's Ann?
I have no idea.

1117
02:28:07.125 --> 02:28:10.526
I heard he offered her
all kinds of money
and she turned him down flat.

1118
02:28:56.374 --> 02:28:57.705
Here's your story, boys.

1119
02:28:57.775 --> 02:29:00.801
"Beauty and the man
who saved her from the beast."

1120
02:29:06.584 --> 02:29:07.551
No.

1121
02:29:15.927 --> 02:29:17.792
We have to get these people
out of here.

1122
02:29:17.862 --> 02:29:19.853
Everyone needs to leave, okay?
Come on.

1123
02:29:21.599 --> 02:29:23.794
Let him roar.
It makes a swell picture.

1124
02:29:25.637 --> 02:29:26.661
Head for the exits.

1125
02:29:26.738 --> 02:29:29.172
Get your own seat, buddy.
You're not having mine.

1126
02:29:37.382 --> 02:29:38.576
Excuse me, fellows.

1127
02:29:39.550 --> 02:29:42.212
Coming through.
Coming through, fellows.

1128
02:29:45.823 --> 02:29:48.815
Get me down! Help me, please!

1129
02:29:51.229 --> 02:29:54.130
Somebody! Somebody help me!

1130
02:29:57.535 --> 02:30:00.197
Go! Go! Get out!

1131
02:30:04.175 --> 02:30:05.665
Go! Go!

1132
02:31:40.705 --> 02:31:42.696
There they are.

1133
02:31:55.987 --> 02:31:57.648
Go!
Wait for me!

1134
02:31:58.556 --> 02:31:59.921
Go back!

1135
02:32:06.864 --> 02:32:08.126
This way!

1136
02:32:15.907 --> 02:32:17.067
Help!

1137
02:32:25.516 --> 02:32:26.483
No!

1138
02:33:06.390 --> 02:33:09.052
Taxi! Follow that ape.

1139
02:33:09.126 --> 02:33:10.616
Come on, pal,
we gotta draw him off.

1140
02:33:10.695 --> 02:33:12.526
It's all yours, buddy.

1141
02:33:28.946 --> 02:33:30.675
Hey, get out of here, lady!

1142
02:33:51.435 --> 02:33:52.663
Come on.

1143
02:34:01.779 --> 02:34:02.768
Buddy!

1144
02:34:04.148 --> 02:34:06.343
Come on. Come on.

1145
02:34:19.764 --> 02:34:20.753
Look out.

1146
02:34:43.454 --> 02:34:44.682
Jesus Christ.

1147
02:40:08.212 --> 02:40:09.304
Fire!

1148
02:40:11.749 --> 02:40:12.807
Stop!

1149
02:40:38.909 --> 02:40:40.467
No. No.

1150
02:43:11.995 --> 02:43:13.326
Beautiful.

1151
02:43:19.770 --> 02:43:20.828
Yes.

1152
02:43:23.474 --> 02:43:24.839
Yes, it is.

1153
02:48:21.338 --> 02:48:22.464
Hey! Hey!

1154
02:48:22.739 --> 02:48:24.366
Nobody past this point.

1155
02:48:25.609 --> 02:48:27.236
You can't go in there!

1156
02:48:28.578 --> 02:48:29.567
Hey!

1157
02:48:31.715 --> 02:48:32.977
Stop him!

1158
02:48:36.119 --> 02:48:38.383
Hey! Get back.
You're not allowed up there!

1159
02:48:38.455 --> 02:48:40.116
What's going on?
Go!

1160
02:52:22.012 --> 02:52:23.309
No!

1161
02:52:24.481 --> 02:52:26.642
No!

1162
02:52:33.657 --> 02:52:36.285
Please! No!

1163
02:52:36.660 --> 02:52:37.854
No!

1164
02:55:34.437 --> 02:55:36.735
Ann. Ann.

1165
02:56:26.055 --> 02:56:27.352
Move along.

1166
02:56:27.824 --> 02:56:29.724
Just one shot! One shot!

1167
02:56:30.393 --> 02:56:32.486
Come, come!
Boys, how about a photo?

1168
02:56:32.562 --> 02:56:33.551
Look at me.

1169
02:56:33.663 --> 02:56:35.392
Come on, watch the camera.

1170
02:56:38.234 --> 02:56:39.758
Come a little closer.

1171
02:56:40.436 --> 02:56:42.631
That's it, folks.
Show's over. Step back!

1172
02:56:42.705 --> 02:56:44.900
Clear the area. That's it.
Shove off, boys.

1173
02:56:45.608 --> 02:56:47.166
Why'd he do that?

1174
02:56:47.477 --> 02:56:49.945
Climb up there
and get himself cornered.

1175
02:56:50.013 --> 02:56:52.345
The ape must have known
what was coming.

1176
02:56:52.448 --> 02:56:55.076
He's just a dumb animal.
Didn't know nothing.

1177
02:57:01.257 --> 02:57:03.987
What does it matter?
Airplanes got him.

1178
02:57:06.562 --> 02:57:08.530
It wasn't the airplanes.

1179
02:57:12.902 --> 02:57:15.200
It was beauty
killed the beast.
