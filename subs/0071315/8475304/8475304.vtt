1
00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:35.898
All right, Curly, enough's enough.

2
00:02:35.982 --> 00:02:40.653
You can't eat the Venetian blinds.
I just had them installed on Wednesday.

3
00:02:56.878 --> 00:02:58.504
Down the hatch.

4
00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:13.644
- She's no good.
- What can I tell you, kid? You're right.

5
00:03:13.728 --> 00:03:15.396
When you're right, you're right.

6
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.189
And you're right.

7
00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:20.276
I'll pay you the rest next week.

8
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.237
We only caught 60 ton of skipjack
down in San Benedict.

9
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:26.532
And they don't pay you the same for
skipjack as they do albacore or tuna.

10
00:03:26.658 --> 00:03:27.866
Forget it, will you, Curly?

11
00:03:27.993 --> 00:03:31.287
I only brought it up to illustrate a point.
I don't want your last dime.

12
00:03:31.371 --> 00:03:33.622
What kind of a guy do you think I am?

13
00:03:33.707 --> 00:03:36.125
- Thank you, Mr. Gittes.
- Call me Jake.

14
00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.669
Careful driving home, Curl, huh?

15
00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:43.424
Mrs. Mulwray's waiting for you
with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

16
00:03:44.384 --> 00:03:47.219
Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr. Gittes?

17
00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:51.181
- Mrs. Mulwray, how do you do?
- Mr. Gittes.

18
00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:54.727
Now, what seems to be the problem?

19
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.021
My husband,

20
00:03:57.772 --> 00:03:59.773
I believe, is seeing another woman.

21
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.737
- No. Really?
- I'm afraid so.

22
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.488
I am sorry.

23
00:04:06.573 --> 00:04:10.576
Mr. Gittes, please, do you think
we could discuss this alone?

24
00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:15.789
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray.
These are my operatives,

25
00:04:15.874 --> 00:04:19.168
and at some point,
they're going to have to assist me.

26
00:04:19.252 --> 00:04:21.670
I can't do everything myself.

27
00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:23.130
Of course not.

28
00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:24.548
Now,

29
00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:31.388
what makes you certain
that your husband is

30
00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:34.099
involved with someone?

31
00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:35.893
A wife can tell.

32
00:04:37.312 --> 00:04:40.564
Mrs. Mulwray,
do you love your husband?

33
00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:42.900
Yes, of course!

34
00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:45.402
- Then go home and forget everything.
- But, I...

35
00:04:45.487 --> 00:04:47.655
I'm sure that he loves you, too,
Mrs. Mulwray.

36
00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:51.659
Do you know the expression,
"Let sleeping dogs lie"?

37
00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:55.204
You're better off not knowing.

38
00:04:55.288 --> 00:04:56.955
I have to know.

39
00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:02.878
Very well.

40
00:05:04.464 --> 00:05:07.091
What is your husband's first name?

41
00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:08.342
Hollis.

42
00:05:08.426 --> 00:05:10.094
Hollis Mulwray.

43
00:05:11.137 --> 00:05:14.264
- Water and Power?
- He's Chief Engineer.

44
00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:17.476
Chief Engineer?

45
00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:26.694
Mrs. Mulwray, this...

46
00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:31.198
This type of investigation can be hard
on your pocketbook.

47
00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:33.492
It takes time...

48
00:05:33.618 --> 00:05:36.370
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.

49
00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.792
Okay, we'll...

50
00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:44.837
We'll see what we can do.

51
00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:47.506
Gentlemen, today
you can walk out that door,

52
00:05:47.632 --> 00:05:50.676
turn right, hop a streetcar,
and within 25 minutes,

53
00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:53.303
end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.

54
00:05:53.388 --> 00:05:57.099
Now, you can swim in it and you can
fish in it, but you can't drink it,

55
00:05:57.183 --> 00:06:00.477
and you can't irrigate
an orange grove with it.

56
00:06:00.562 --> 00:06:03.188
Now remember,
we live next door to the ocean,

57
00:06:03.398 --> 00:06:06.316
but we also live on
the edge of a desert.

58
00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:09.069
Los Angeles is a desert community.

59
00:06:09.154 --> 00:06:12.740
Beneath this building,
beneath our streets, is a desert.

60
00:06:12.991 --> 00:06:15.826
And without water,
the dust will rise up and cover us

61
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.369
as though we never existed.

62
00:06:17.495 --> 00:06:20.664
Now, the Alto Vallejo
can save us from this,

63
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:24.626
and I respectfully suggest
that $8.5 million

64
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:28.714
is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert from our streets

65
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.840
and not on top of them.

66
00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:31.091
Hear, hear!

67
00:06:36.014 --> 00:06:39.683
Mayor Bagby, let's hear
from all the departments again.

68
00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:43.020
I suppose we'd better take
Water and Power first.

69
00:06:43.104 --> 00:06:44.354
Mr. Mulwray?

70
00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:57.826
In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,

71
00:06:57.911 --> 00:07:01.580
over 500 lives were lost
when the Van der Lip Dam gave way.

72
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.668
Core samples have shown
that beneath this bedrock

73
00:07:06.753 --> 00:07:11.381
is shale similar to the permeable shale
in the Van der Lip disaster.

74
00:07:11.466 --> 00:07:14.468
It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure.

75
00:07:14.552 --> 00:07:18.180
And now you propose
yet another dirt-banked terminus dam

76
00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:21.475
with slopes of 2.5:1, 112 feet high,

77
00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:24.061
and a 12,000-acre water surface.

78
00:07:25.063 --> 00:07:26.563
Well, it won't hold.

79
00:07:27.148 --> 00:07:29.775
I won't build it. It's that simple.

80
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:32.653
I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

81
00:07:32.737 --> 00:07:34.613
Thank you, gentlemen.

82
00:07:40.411 --> 00:07:42.746
Quiet! Quiet!

83
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:49.169
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get those goddamn things out of here!

84
00:07:49.254 --> 00:07:51.630
- Hold some of them.
- Tell me where to take them!

85
00:07:51.756 --> 00:07:55.300
You don't have an answer for that
so quick, do you?

86
00:07:55.426 --> 00:07:59.012
You steal water from the Valley,
ruin the grazing,

87
00:07:59.973 --> 00:08:01.890
starve the livestock!

88
00:08:01.975 --> 00:08:04.351
Who's paying you to do that,
Mr. Mulwray?

89
00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:06.144
That's what I want to know!

90
00:12:52.723 --> 00:12:55.892
- Jeez, he was there all night.
- That's right.

91
00:12:56.811 --> 00:13:00.313
I had to go back three times
to pick up the watches.

92
00:13:06.154 --> 00:13:07.988
Yesterday he went to three reservoirs,

93
00:13:08.072 --> 00:13:11.658
a men's room at a Richfield gas station,
and The Pig'n Whistle.

94
00:13:11.784 --> 00:13:14.327
The guy's got water on the brain.

95
00:13:26.174 --> 00:13:28.300
So what do you got?

96
00:13:50.448 --> 00:13:51.489
This?

97
00:13:51.616 --> 00:13:55.785
Well, they got into a terrific argument
outside The Pig'n Whistle.

98
00:13:57.788 --> 00:13:58.872
What about?

99
00:13:58.956 --> 00:14:01.416
I don't know.
The traffic was pretty loud.

100
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.376
I heard only one thing, though.

101
00:14:03.461 --> 00:14:04.794
"Apple core."

102
00:14:05.504 --> 00:14:07.839
- "Apple core"?
- Yeah.

103
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.095
My God, Walsh, is that
what you spent your day doing?

104
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.389
Look, you tell me to take pictures,
I take pictures.

105
00:14:17.683 --> 00:14:20.310
Let me explain
something to you, Walsh.

106
00:14:20.394 --> 00:14:21.811
J.J. Gittes and Associates.

107
00:14:21.896 --> 00:14:25.315
This business requires
a certain amount of finesse.

108
00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:29.569
What is it, Sophie?

109
00:14:29.654 --> 00:14:31.571
Duffy's on the phone.

110
00:14:36.327 --> 00:14:37.953
- Yeah, Duff, where are you?
- I got it!

111
00:14:38.037 --> 00:14:40.747
He's found himself some cute
little twist, the old buzzard...

112
00:14:40.831 --> 00:14:42.374
Okay. Slow down. Where are you?

113
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.167
I'm at Glendale and Douglas.

114
00:14:44.252 --> 00:14:47.128
They're in Echo Park in a rowboat.
A rowboat!

115
00:14:47.213 --> 00:14:48.546
Okay.

116
00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:52.884
Echo Park.

117
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.094
Water again.

118
00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:10.694
Okay, pal, let's have us a big smile.

119
00:15:18.244 --> 00:15:19.869
You'll love it.

120
00:16:10.254 --> 00:16:12.255
Here. Let me...

121
00:16:24.518 --> 00:16:27.687
When you get so much publicity,
you got to get blasé about it.

122
00:16:27.772 --> 00:16:31.316
Let's face it, Jake,
you're practically a movie star.

123
00:16:36.113 --> 00:16:39.240
- Just look at that, Barn.
- Yeah, the heat's murder.

124
00:16:39.325 --> 00:16:40.700
Sure is.

125
00:16:40.785 --> 00:16:43.161
Fools' names and fools' faces.

126
00:16:47.124 --> 00:16:49.292
- What's that, pal?
- Nothing.

127
00:16:50.294 --> 00:16:52.003
You got a hell of a
way to make a living.

128
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:55.382
Oh? And what do you do
to make ends meet?

129
00:16:55.466 --> 00:16:58.385
Mortgage department,
First National Bank.

130
00:16:59.053 --> 00:17:02.639
Tell me, did you foreclose
on many families this week?

131
00:17:02.723 --> 00:17:05.141
We don't publish a record in the paper,
I can tell you that.

132
00:17:05.226 --> 00:17:06.726
Neither do I.

133
00:17:06.811 --> 00:17:09.312
No, you have your press agent do it.

134
00:17:09.397 --> 00:17:12.690
Who is this bimbo, Barney?
Is he a regular customer or what?

135
00:17:12.817 --> 00:17:14.484
Hey, listen, pal, I
make an honest living.

136
00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:16.569
People only come to me
when they're in a desperate situation.

137
00:17:16.654 --> 00:17:18.905
I help them out. I don't kick
families out of their houses

138
00:17:18.989 --> 00:17:21.950
- like you bums down at the bank do!
- Jake, can I tell you about the guy who...

139
00:17:22.034 --> 00:17:23.868
Maybe you'd like to step down
out of the barber chair

140
00:17:23.994 --> 00:17:25.453
and maybe we can go outside
and discuss it.

141
00:17:25.538 --> 00:17:26.579
- What do you think?
- Oh, come on.

142
00:17:26.664 --> 00:17:28.039
Jake, let me tell you about the guy
who got tired...

143
00:17:28.165 --> 00:17:30.166
I don't know how that thing
got in the newspaper.

144
00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:32.419
It was so quick,
I didn't even know it myself.

145
00:17:32.503 --> 00:17:34.629
- Thank you.
- I make an honest living!

146
00:17:34.713 --> 00:17:36.172
- Of course you do.
- Huh?

147
00:17:36.257 --> 00:17:38.591
Anyway, this guy
who got tired of screwing his wife

148
00:17:38.676 --> 00:17:41.094
- said to his friend, "What do I do?"
- An honest living, you understand?

149
00:17:41.178 --> 00:17:43.096
So the guy says, "Why don't you do
what the Chinese do?"

150
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.806
He says, "What do the Chinese do?"

151
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.016
He says, "The Chinese they screw
a little and they get tired..."

152
00:17:48.602 --> 00:17:50.520
Duffy. Hey, Walsh!

153
00:17:50.604 --> 00:17:54.274
Sophie, go to the little girls' room
for a minute, okay?

154
00:17:54.567 --> 00:17:57.068
- But, Mr. Gittes...
- Sophie...

155
00:17:58.237 --> 00:17:59.737
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

156
00:17:59.864 --> 00:18:00.905
- Jake...
- Duffy, listen to me, man.

157
00:18:01.031 --> 00:18:02.282
I want to tell you a story.

158
00:18:02.366 --> 00:18:04.492
So, there's this guy, Walsh,
you understand?

159
00:18:04.577 --> 00:18:06.369
He's tired of screwing his wife.

160
00:18:06.454 --> 00:18:08.037
- Jake, there's a problem...
- Wait a second, Duffy.

161
00:18:08.122 --> 00:18:09.706
You're always in such a hurry.

162
00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.458
So his friend says to him,

163
00:18:11.542 --> 00:18:13.710
"Hey, why don't you
do it like the Chinese do?"

164
00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:15.753
So he says,
"Well, how do the Chinese do it?"

165
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.506
The guy says, "Well, the Chinese,
first they screw a little bit,

166
00:18:18.591 --> 00:18:21.259
"then they stop and they go
and read a little Confucius.

167
00:18:21.385 --> 00:18:24.220
"Come back, screw a little bit more,
then they stop again,

168
00:18:24.305 --> 00:18:26.181
- "go back and they screw a little..."
- Jake.

169
00:18:26.265 --> 00:18:28.600
Walsh, just listen to me for a second.

170
00:18:28.726 --> 00:18:30.143
I mean, you'll love this.

171
00:18:30.227 --> 00:18:33.396
Now, then they go back
and they screw a little bit more,

172
00:18:33.481 --> 00:18:35.440
and then they go out
and they contemplate the moon

173
00:18:35.566 --> 00:18:38.485
or something like that.
Makes it more exciting.

174
00:18:38.569 --> 00:18:42.489
So, now, the guy goes home and
he starts screwing his own wife, see.

175
00:18:42.907 --> 00:18:44.866
So, he screws her for a little bit,
and then he stops.

176
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.702
He goes out of the room
and reads LIFE magazine.

177
00:18:47.786 --> 00:18:49.871
Then he goes back in,
he starts screwing again,

178
00:18:49.955 --> 00:18:51.456
and he says,
"Excuse me for a minute, honey"

179
00:18:51.582 --> 00:18:53.249
and he goes out
and he smokes a cigarette.

180
00:18:53.334 --> 00:18:55.710
Now, his wife is getting sore as hell.

181
00:18:55.794 --> 00:18:57.754
He comes back in the room,
he starts screwing again,

182
00:18:57.838 --> 00:18:59.839
he gets up to start to leave again
to go look at the moon,

183
00:18:59.924 --> 00:19:01.758
she looks at him and says,
"Hey, what's the matter with you?

184
00:19:01.842 --> 00:19:04.677
"You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"

185
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.597
Jesus!

186
00:19:07.932 --> 00:19:09.432
That Barney!

187
00:19:14.813 --> 00:19:16.147
Mr. Gittes?

188
00:19:17.983 --> 00:19:19.150
Yes.

189
00:19:19.944 --> 00:19:21.528
Do you know me?

190
00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.780
Well,

191
00:19:25.282 --> 00:19:27.659
I think I would have remembered.

192
00:19:27.785 --> 00:19:29.702
Have we ever met?

193
00:19:32.122 --> 00:19:33.623
Well, no.

194
00:19:33.707 --> 00:19:35.041
Never?

195
00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:36.376
Never.

196
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:38.211
That's what I thought.

197
00:19:38.295 --> 00:19:40.380
You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

198
00:19:40.464 --> 00:19:42.799
You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife?

199
00:19:44.301 --> 00:19:47.512
Not that Mulwray?

200
00:19:47.638 --> 00:19:50.223
Yes, Mr. Gittes, that Mulwray.

201
00:19:51.809 --> 00:19:54.602
And since you agree with me
that we've never met before,

202
00:19:54.687 --> 00:19:57.981
you must also agree with me
that I never hired you to do anything,

203
00:19:58.065 --> 00:20:00.525
certainly not spy on my husband.

204
00:20:00.651 --> 00:20:03.361
I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.

205
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.823
Well, you're going to get it.

206
00:20:07.658 --> 00:20:09.033
Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray.

207
00:20:09.159 --> 00:20:11.202
I think there's been some
misunderstanding here.

208
00:20:11.328 --> 00:20:12.912
There's no point
in getting tough with me. I'm just...

209
00:20:12.997 --> 00:20:16.040
I don't get tough with
anyone, Mr. Gittes.

210
00:20:16.166 --> 00:20:17.834
My lawyer does.

211
00:20:19.336 --> 00:20:22.046
Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.

212
00:20:25.426 --> 00:20:28.595
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

213
00:20:44.028 --> 00:20:46.362
- Mr. Mulwray?
- He's not in, Mr...

214
00:20:46.447 --> 00:20:49.157
- Gittes.
- May I ask what this is regarding?

215
00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:51.576
It's a personal matter.
Has he been gone long?

216
00:20:51.702 --> 00:20:53.202
Since lunch.

217
00:20:53.579 --> 00:20:56.831
- Gee whiz, and I'm late.
- He was expecting you?

218
00:20:56.915 --> 00:21:00.460
Fifteen minutes ago.
Why don't I just go in and wait?

219
00:21:01.629 --> 00:21:02.920
Sir?

220
00:21:06.592 --> 00:21:08.718
Is Mr. Yelburton there?

221
00:21:09.553 --> 00:21:11.888
Is he still in the building?

222
00:21:12.556 --> 00:21:14.432
Very well. Thank you.

223
00:22:36.473 --> 00:22:40.184
Can I help you? Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

224
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.811
J.J. Gittes.

225
00:22:41.895 --> 00:22:44.522
It's not a departmental matter,
Mr. Yelburton.

226
00:22:44.648 --> 00:22:46.858
I wonder if you'd care
to wait in my office.

227
00:22:46.984 --> 00:22:48.067
Certainly.

228
00:22:48.986 --> 00:22:51.237
We're a bit nervous around here

229
00:22:51.321 --> 00:22:54.240
with all this business in the papers
about Mr. Mulwray.

230
00:22:54.324 --> 00:22:56.033
Right this way.

231
00:23:01.749 --> 00:23:05.084
You know, after you've worked
with a man for a certain length of time,

232
00:23:06.378 --> 00:23:08.963
you come to know his habits, his values.

233
00:23:09.047 --> 00:23:10.131
You come to know him.

234
00:23:10.215 --> 00:23:13.426
And either he's the kind
who chases after women or he isn't.

235
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.886
And Mulwray isn't?

236
00:23:15.012 --> 00:23:17.263
He never even kids about it.

237
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:20.433
Well, maybe he takes it very seriously.

238
00:23:22.936 --> 00:23:25.563
- Sit down.
- No, thank you.

239
00:23:25.689 --> 00:23:27.857
Do you know
where Mulwray's having lunch?

240
00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:30.026
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

241
00:23:30.694 --> 00:23:32.945
Well, tell him I'll be back.

242
00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:35.281
I will.

243
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.617
Do you mind if I take one of your cards?

244
00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:39.577
In case I have
to get in touch with you again.

245
00:23:39.703 --> 00:23:42.038
- No, help yourself.
- Thank you.

246
00:23:46.543 --> 00:23:48.878
Mulvihill! What are you doing here?

247
00:23:48.962 --> 00:23:51.297
They shut my water off.
What's it to you?

248
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:54.675
How'd you find out about it?
You don't drink it.

249
00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.303
You don't take a bath in it.

250
00:23:57.387 --> 00:23:59.096
They wrote you a letter!

251
00:23:59.223 --> 00:24:02.141
But then you'd have to be able to read.

252
00:24:03.769 --> 00:24:07.563
Relax, Mulvihill. Glad to see you.
You know Claude Mulvihill here?

253
00:24:07.648 --> 00:24:10.274
Well, I hope so. He's working for us.

254
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.484
Doing what?

255
00:24:11.568 --> 00:24:13.069
Well, frankly, there have been
some threats

256
00:24:13.153 --> 00:24:14.946
to blow up the city reservoirs.

257
00:24:15.072 --> 00:24:17.615
- Any particular reason?
- Well, it's this darn drought.

258
00:24:17.741 --> 00:24:20.368
We've had to ration water in the Valley
and the farmers are desperate.

259
00:24:20.452 --> 00:24:22.954
But what can we do? The rest of the city
needs drinking water.

260
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.706
- Well, you're in luck, Mr. Yelburton.
- How's that?

261
00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:28.376
When Mulvihill here
was Sheriff of Ventura County,

262
00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.838
the rum runners landed hundreds
of tons of booze on the beach

263
00:24:31.922 --> 00:24:34.423
and never lost a drop.

264
00:24:34.508 --> 00:24:37.844
He ought to be able
to hold on to your water for you.

265
00:25:37.905 --> 00:25:40.489
J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

266
00:26:04.348 --> 00:26:05.681
Please.

267
00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:22.865
You wait.

268
00:27:24.428 --> 00:27:27.596
- Bad for glass.
- Yeah. Sure.

269
00:27:28.682 --> 00:27:30.933
Bad for the glass.

270
00:28:07.512 --> 00:28:08.596
Mr. Gittes.

271
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.183
Actually, I came to see
your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.

272
00:28:14.811 --> 00:28:16.604
Would you like something to drink?

273
00:28:16.688 --> 00:28:17.897
What are you having?

274
00:28:17.981 --> 00:28:20.775
- Iced tea.
- That'll be fine, thank you.

275
00:28:20.859 --> 00:28:24.070
- Two iced teas, Kahn, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

276
00:28:25.197 --> 00:28:27.364
My husband's at the office.

277
00:28:28.575 --> 00:28:31.285
Actually, he's not, Mrs. Mulwray,

278
00:28:31.369 --> 00:28:33.913
and he's checked out of his apartment
at the El Macondo.

279
00:28:33.997 --> 00:28:36.832
That's not his apartment.

280
00:28:38.335 --> 00:28:39.710
Anyway, I...

281
00:28:41.213 --> 00:28:44.507
The point is, is I'm not in business
to be loved, but I am in business,

282
00:28:44.591 --> 00:28:47.009
and believe me, Mrs. Mulwray,
whoever set your husband up,

283
00:28:47.094 --> 00:28:48.219
set me up.

284
00:28:48.345 --> 00:28:50.554
L.A.'s a small town. People talk.

285
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.141
I'm just trying to make a living.
I don't want to become a local joke.

286
00:28:54.226 --> 00:28:57.728
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it.
I'll drop the lawsuit.

287
00:28:57.854 --> 00:28:59.980
- What?
- I said, I'll drop the lawsuit.

288
00:29:00.065 --> 00:29:02.191
So let's just drop the whole thing.

289
00:29:02.275 --> 00:29:04.026
- Sugar, lemon, or both?
- Both.

290
00:29:04.111 --> 00:29:05.945
- Mrs. Mulwray...
- Yes, Mr. Gittes?

291
00:29:06.029 --> 00:29:08.197
...I don't want to drop it.

292
00:29:09.616 --> 00:29:12.535
I better talk to your
husband about this.

293
00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:15.121
Why? What on Earth for?

294
00:29:15.205 --> 00:29:17.331
Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

295
00:29:18.625 --> 00:29:21.168
Well, I've been accused
of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray,

296
00:29:21.253 --> 00:29:22.378
but never that.

297
00:29:22.462 --> 00:29:24.421
Look, somebody's gone
to a lot of trouble here,

298
00:29:24.548 --> 00:29:26.841
and lawsuit or no lawsuit,
I intend to find out.

299
00:29:26.925 --> 00:29:30.219
I'm not supposed to be the one
who's caught with his pants down.

300
00:29:30.303 --> 00:29:32.763
So unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk to your husband.

301
00:29:32.889 --> 00:29:34.807
Why should it be a problem?

302
00:29:34.891 --> 00:29:39.145
- May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
- You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

303
00:29:40.313 --> 00:29:42.523
Well, that little girlfriend,
she was pretty,

304
00:29:42.607 --> 00:29:44.900
in a cheap sort of a way, of course.

305
00:29:44.985 --> 00:29:48.320
She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together.

306
00:29:48.405 --> 00:29:51.407
Suppose they did.
How does that affect you?

307
00:29:51.908 --> 00:29:54.618
- It's nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray.
- It's very personal!

308
00:29:54.744 --> 00:29:57.079
It couldn't be more personal.

309
00:29:57.914 --> 00:30:00.749
Is this business
or an obsession with you?

310
00:30:00.834 --> 00:30:02.793
Let's look at it this way.

311
00:30:02.919 --> 00:30:06.505
Now, this phony broad,
excuse the language,

312
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:09.091
she tells me she's you. She hires me.

313
00:30:09.176 --> 00:30:11.385
Now, whoever put her up to it
doesn't have anything against me.

314
00:30:11.469 --> 00:30:12.636
They're out to get your husband.

315
00:30:12.762 --> 00:30:15.264
If I can see him, I can help him.

316
00:30:18.351 --> 00:30:20.936
Did you talk to him this morning?

317
00:30:21.605 --> 00:30:22.646
No.

318
00:30:23.315 --> 00:30:25.107
I went riding rather early.

319
00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:27.735
Looks like you went quite a distance.

320
00:30:27.819 --> 00:30:29.778
I was riding bareback.

321
00:30:31.364 --> 00:30:32.615
You...

322
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.951
You might try the Oak Pass
or the Stone Canyon Reservoir.

323
00:30:36.036 --> 00:30:37.870
Frequently, at lunch,
Hollis takes walks around them.

324
00:30:37.954 --> 00:30:39.496
Otherwise, he'll be home by 6:30.

325
00:30:39.623 --> 00:30:41.290
I'll stop by.

326
00:30:41.374 --> 00:30:43.167
Please call first.

327
00:30:59.643 --> 00:31:01.810
Sorry, closed to public, sir.

328
00:31:02.395 --> 00:31:04.813
Oh, that's all right, Officer.

329
00:31:06.191 --> 00:31:09.318
Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

330
00:31:09.819 --> 00:31:12.988
- Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.
- That's okay.

331
00:31:38.765 --> 00:31:41.016
- Gittes! For Christ's sake!
- Loach.

332
00:31:41.101 --> 00:31:43.310
- Get out of here before he sees you.
- What are you talking about?

333
00:31:43.395 --> 00:31:45.729
- What's going on here?
- Loach!

334
00:31:47.357 --> 00:31:48.857
Hello, Jake.

335
00:31:49.693 --> 00:31:51.527
Lou. How are you?

336
00:31:52.696 --> 00:31:57.366
Lousy cold I can't seem to shake,
but otherwise, I'm okay.

337
00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:01.620
- Yeah, summer colds are the worst.
- Yeah, they are.

338
00:32:01.705 --> 00:32:03.163
There's no smoking here, sir...

339
00:32:03.248 --> 00:32:06.125
That's all right, Officer.
We can make an exception this time.

340
00:32:06.209 --> 00:32:09.503
I'll see he's careful with the matches
and doesn't burn himself.

341
00:32:09.587 --> 00:32:11.255
Thanks, Lou.

342
00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:13.716
How'd you get past the guard?

343
00:32:14.467 --> 00:32:17.261
Well, to tell you the truth,
I lied a little.

344
00:32:18.388 --> 00:32:21.348
You look like
you've done well by yourself.

345
00:32:21.433 --> 00:32:22.474
I get by.

346
00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:25.978
Well, sometimes it takes a while
for a man to find himself.

347
00:32:26.062 --> 00:32:27.271
Maybe you have.

348
00:32:27.397 --> 00:32:30.441
Yeah, going through
other people's dirty linen.

349
00:32:30.567 --> 00:32:34.403
Yeah. Tell me,
you still putting Chinamen in jail

350
00:32:34.487 --> 00:32:36.780
for spitting in the laundry?

351
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.783
You're a little behind the times, Jake.

352
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:41.952
They use steam irons now.

353
00:32:42.162 --> 00:32:44.246
And I'm out of Chinatown.

354
00:32:44.914 --> 00:32:46.332
Since when?

355
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.917
Since I made lieutenant.

356
00:32:49.836 --> 00:32:51.253
Congratulations.

357
00:32:51.338 --> 00:32:52.463
Hmm.

358
00:32:52.589 --> 00:32:56.175
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm looking for somebody.

359
00:32:56.259 --> 00:32:57.426
Who?

360
00:32:57.969 --> 00:33:00.304
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

361
00:33:00.847 --> 00:33:02.097
Yeah.

362
00:33:02.599 --> 00:33:04.683
I'd like to talk to him.

363
00:33:05.268 --> 00:33:07.603
So you'd like to talk to him, huh?

364
00:33:09.105 --> 00:33:11.023
You're welcome to try.

365
00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:13.859
There he is.

366
00:33:31.836 --> 00:33:35.631
Looks like he was washed down the
entire length of the run-off channel.

367
00:33:36.466 --> 00:33:38.967
- Could he swim?
- Of course.

368
00:33:40.303 --> 00:33:43.847
Obviously, the fall
must have knocked him unconscious.

369
00:33:45.642 --> 00:33:47.142
Mrs. Mulwray,

370
00:33:48.311 --> 00:33:51.480
this alleged affair
your husband was having.

371
00:33:52.482 --> 00:33:55.025
The publicity didn't make him

372
00:33:56.152 --> 00:33:57.986
morose, or unhappy?

373
00:33:59.364 --> 00:34:01.448
It didn't make him happy.

374
00:34:01.533 --> 00:34:04.368
There is no possibility
that he would have taken his own life?

375
00:34:04.494 --> 00:34:05.661
No.

376
00:34:07.664 --> 00:34:09.331
Mrs. Mulwray,

377
00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:13.419
do you happen to know the name
of the young lady in question?

378
00:34:14.754 --> 00:34:15.879
No.

379
00:34:16.214 --> 00:34:18.298
- Or where she might be?
- Certainly not.

380
00:34:18.383 --> 00:34:21.260
You and your husband
never discussed her?

381
00:34:23.012 --> 00:34:24.179
He...

382
00:34:25.181 --> 00:34:26.390
We did.

383
00:34:27.016 --> 00:34:29.351
He wouldn't tell me her name.

384
00:34:29.769 --> 00:34:34.064
We quarreled over her, of course.
It came as a complete surprise to me.

385
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.150
A complete surprise?

386
00:34:36.234 --> 00:34:38.777
I thought you hired
a private investigator.

387
00:34:39.529 --> 00:34:42.030
A private investigator?

388
00:34:42.907 --> 00:34:44.408
Mr. Gittes.

389
00:34:50.248 --> 00:34:53.709
Yes, but I did that
because I thought I would put an end

390
00:34:53.793 --> 00:34:56.628
to a ridiculous rumor
that had no basis.

391
00:34:57.255 --> 00:34:59.423
Uh-huh.

392
00:34:59.966 --> 00:35:01.341
When did Mr. Gittes inform you

393
00:35:01.426 --> 00:35:04.011
that these rumors
had some foundation in fact?

394
00:35:04.095 --> 00:35:07.306
Just before the story
broke in the papers, Lou.

395
00:35:08.391 --> 00:35:10.767
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could find her?

396
00:35:10.894 --> 00:35:11.977
No.

397
00:35:12.562 --> 00:35:14.771
- Or her name?
- No.

398
00:35:15.773 --> 00:35:16.857
Of course not.

399
00:35:16.941 --> 00:35:19.151
Will you need me
for anything else, Lieutenant?

400
00:35:19.235 --> 00:35:21.445
Oh, no, no, Mrs. Mulwray,
I don't think so.

401
00:35:21.571 --> 00:35:24.990
If we need any more information,
we'll be in touch.

402
00:35:25.617 --> 00:35:28.410
Of course you have
my deepest sympathy.

403
00:35:29.746 --> 00:35:32.623
I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.

404
00:35:35.418 --> 00:35:38.712
- Jake, come on, what's the story?
- Take it easy, guys. Let us get through.

405
00:35:38.796 --> 00:35:40.172
We better do this in a hurry.

406
00:35:40.256 --> 00:35:43.592
Let us through, guys!
Give us a little room!

407
00:35:45.178 --> 00:35:47.471
You want a picture, guys? Here it is!

408
00:35:47.597 --> 00:35:49.598
"Gittes", two T's and an E.

409
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.144
Thank you for
going along with me back there.

410
00:35:54.604 --> 00:35:57.439
I just didn't want to explain anything.

411
00:35:57.982 --> 00:35:59.775
I'll send you a check.

412
00:35:59.859 --> 00:36:00.943
A check?

413
00:36:01.027 --> 00:36:03.946
To make it official that I've hired you.

414
00:36:20.129 --> 00:36:22.673
I'll get to him this afternoon if I can.

415
00:36:22.799 --> 00:36:25.092
Jake, what are you doing here?

416
00:36:25.176 --> 00:36:26.718
Nothing, Morty. It's my lunch hour.

417
00:36:26.803 --> 00:36:29.555
Thought I'd drop by
and see who dropped dead lately.

418
00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:31.473
Yeah? Isn't this something?

419
00:36:32.058 --> 00:36:34.643
Middle of a drought,
and the Water Commissioner drowns.

420
00:36:34.727 --> 00:36:37.312
- Only in L.A.
- Yeah.

421
00:36:37.522 --> 00:36:40.816
- Looks pretty banged up.
- Well, it's a long fall.

422
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.365
So how are you doing, Morty?

423
00:36:48.992 --> 00:36:52.244
Never better, except for this darn cough.

424
00:36:52.328 --> 00:36:54.580
- You know me, Jake.
- Yeah.

425
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:04.381
Who you got there?

426
00:37:04.507 --> 00:37:07.426
Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk.

427
00:37:08.177 --> 00:37:10.887
Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.

428
00:37:12.348 --> 00:37:14.182
Quite a character.

429
00:37:14.267 --> 00:37:18.228
Lately he'd been living
in one of the downtown storm drains.

430
00:37:19.689 --> 00:37:22.899
Had a bureau dresser down there
and everything.

431
00:37:23.735 --> 00:37:25.068
All right, there.

432
00:37:31.618 --> 00:37:33.660
Yeah. He drowned, too.

433
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:36.079
Come again?

434
00:37:36.164 --> 00:37:39.791
Yeah. Got drunk, passed out
in the bottom of the riverbed.

435
00:37:39.876 --> 00:37:41.418
The L.A. River?

436
00:37:41.669 --> 00:37:45.172
Yeah, right under Hollenbeck Bridge.
What's wrong with that?

437
00:37:45.256 --> 00:37:47.466
Well, it's dry as a bone, Morty.

438
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:49.926
It's not completely dry.

439
00:37:50.011 --> 00:37:52.804
Well, he ain't gonna exactly
drown in a damp riverbed,

440
00:37:52.889 --> 00:37:54.973
no matter how soused he is.

441
00:37:55.058 --> 00:37:57.726
We got water out of him. He drowned!

442
00:38:55.827 --> 00:38:57.077
Hello.

443
00:39:04.585 --> 00:39:05.836
Howdy.

444
00:39:06.254 --> 00:39:09.631
You were riding out here
the other day, weren't you?

445
00:39:11.718 --> 00:39:12.968
Do you speak English?

446
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:21.560
You were talking to a man
a few days ago. He wore glasses...

447
00:39:21.978 --> 00:39:23.061
Yes.

448
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.773
What did you talk about,
do you mind my asking?

449
00:39:26.858 --> 00:39:29.568
- The water.
- What about the water?

450
00:39:29.652 --> 00:39:32.028
- When it comes.
- When it comes?

451
00:39:33.072 --> 00:39:34.656
What did you tell him?

452
00:39:34.741 --> 00:39:37.325
It comes in different parts of the river.

453
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.703
Every night a different part.

454
00:42:00.887 --> 00:42:04.890
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn Florsheim shoe.

455
00:42:13.024 --> 00:42:16.151
Hold it there, kitty-cat! Hold it!

456
00:42:22.074 --> 00:42:25.243
Hello, Claude.
Where'd you get the midget?

457
00:42:30.249 --> 00:42:33.126
You're a very nosy
fellow, kitty-cat, huh?

458
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.003
You know what happens
to nosy fellows?

459
00:42:35.087 --> 00:42:39.007
No? Want to guess? No?

460
00:42:39.091 --> 00:42:41.301
Okay. They lose their noses.

461
00:42:46.515 --> 00:42:48.808
Next time you lose the whole thing.

462
00:42:48.893 --> 00:42:51.686
Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish.

463
00:42:53.064 --> 00:42:54.189
Understand?

464
00:42:55.066 --> 00:42:56.650
- Understand?
- Don't you understand, Gittes?

465
00:42:56.734 --> 00:42:58.443
I understand.

466
00:42:58.527 --> 00:42:59.945
All right.

467
00:43:10.873 --> 00:43:13.041
So some contractor
wants to build a dam,

468
00:43:13.125 --> 00:43:15.627
and he makes a few payoffs. So what?

469
00:43:15.711 --> 00:43:19.255
Think you can nail Mulvihill?
They'll claim you were trespassing.

470
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.966
Don't want Mulvihill.

471
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:23.927
I want the big boys
that are making the payoffs.

472
00:43:24.011 --> 00:43:25.387
Then what do you do?

473
00:43:25.471 --> 00:43:27.138
Sue the shit out of them.

474
00:43:27.223 --> 00:43:28.723
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

475
00:43:31.102 --> 00:43:34.312
- What is it, Sophie?
- A Miss Sessions is calling.

476
00:43:34.772 --> 00:43:36.982
- Who?
- Ida Sessions.

477
00:43:38.693 --> 00:43:41.069
Don't know her. Take a number.

478
00:43:41.487 --> 00:43:42.862
Sue people like that,

479
00:43:42.947 --> 00:43:46.282
they're liable to be having dinner
with the judge who's trying the suit.

480
00:43:47.743 --> 00:43:50.829
I'm sorry. Miss Sessions insists.

481
00:43:50.913 --> 00:43:52.038
She says you know her.

482
00:43:53.582 --> 00:43:54.749
Okay.

483
00:43:59.046 --> 00:44:02.424
Hello, Miss Sessions.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

484
00:44:02.508 --> 00:44:04.426
Oh, yes, we have.

485
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:06.553
- Are you alone?
- Isn't everyone?

486
00:44:07.847 --> 00:44:09.806
What can I do for you?

487
00:44:11.058 --> 00:44:13.351
Well, I'm a working girl.

488
00:44:13.436 --> 00:44:15.770
I didn't come in to see you on my own.

489
00:44:15.855 --> 00:44:17.647
When did you come in?

490
00:44:17.732 --> 00:44:21.317
I was the one who pretended to be
Mrs. Mulwray. Remember?

491
00:44:21.402 --> 00:44:24.029
- Shut the fuck up.
- Beg your pardon?

492
00:44:24.447 --> 00:44:27.615
- Yes, I remember.
- Beg your pardon? Is something wrong?

493
00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.911
No. I was just checking a detail
or two with my two associates.

494
00:44:31.996 --> 00:44:33.121
Go on.

495
00:44:33.247 --> 00:44:36.708
I never expected anything to happen
like what happened to Mr. Mulwray.

496
00:44:36.792 --> 00:44:39.335
The point is, if it ever comes out,

497
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.422
I want somebody to know
that I didn't know what would happen.

498
00:44:42.506 --> 00:44:44.049
I understand.

499
00:44:45.009 --> 00:44:47.719
Who was your employer?
That could be helpful to both of us.

500
00:44:47.803 --> 00:44:49.345
Oh, no! Oh, no.

501
00:44:49.889 --> 00:44:51.056
No.

502
00:44:52.516 --> 00:44:54.851
What's your address?
Maybe we could talk this over.

503
00:44:54.935 --> 00:44:56.019
No, Mr. Gittes.

504
00:44:56.103 --> 00:44:59.189
Just look in the obituary column
of today's L.A. Post-Record.

505
00:44:59.273 --> 00:45:00.857
The obituary column?

506
00:45:00.941 --> 00:45:04.736
- You'll find one of those people.
- "Those people"? Miss...

507
00:45:06.655 --> 00:45:07.906
Sure.

508
00:45:08.991 --> 00:45:10.700
How do you like them apples?

509
00:45:41.565 --> 00:45:43.733
Ma'am.

510
00:45:48.072 --> 00:45:49.989
Thank you for coming.

511
00:45:57.456 --> 00:45:59.499
- Yes, sir?
- Drink?

512
00:46:00.209 --> 00:46:02.710
Tom Collins.
With lime, not lemon, please.

513
00:46:02.795 --> 00:46:04.796
Tom Collins with lime.

514
00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:10.593
I got your check in the mail.

515
00:46:10.678 --> 00:46:13.930
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.

516
00:46:14.974 --> 00:46:18.268
Mrs. Mulwray,
I'm afraid that's not good enough.

517
00:46:22.106 --> 00:46:23.815
How much would you like?

518
00:46:23.899 --> 00:46:26.985
Oh, stop it, The money's fine.
It's generous.

519
00:46:27.153 --> 00:46:32.073
But I think you short-changed me
on the story.

520
00:46:32.908 --> 00:46:35.160
- I have?
- I think so.

521
00:46:35.244 --> 00:46:38.454
Something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you.

522
00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:40.957
You were upset, but not that upset.

523
00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:44.085
Mr. Gittes, don't tell me how I feel.

524
00:46:47.715 --> 00:46:48.965
Sorry.

525
00:46:50.551 --> 00:46:55.013
Look, you sue me, your husband dies,
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato,

526
00:46:55.097 --> 00:46:58.474
all of it quicker
than the wind from a duck's ass.

527
00:46:58.809 --> 00:47:00.226
Excuse me.

528
00:47:01.478 --> 00:47:05.732
- Then you ask me to lie to the police...
- It wasn't much of a lie.

529
00:47:05.816 --> 00:47:08.318
If your husband was killed, it was.

530
00:47:08.402 --> 00:47:11.988
This could look like you paid me off
to withhold evidence.

531
00:47:12.072 --> 00:47:13.990
But he wasn't killed.

532
00:47:16.452 --> 00:47:19.537
Mrs. Mulwray,
I think you're hiding something.

533
00:47:24.627 --> 00:47:25.919
Well,

534
00:47:27.755 --> 00:47:29.339
I suppose I am.

535
00:47:30.591 --> 00:47:33.176
Actually, I knew about the affair.

536
00:47:34.178 --> 00:47:37.096
- How did you find out?
- My husband.

537
00:47:37.181 --> 00:47:38.681
He told you?

538
00:47:39.266 --> 00:47:41.851
And you weren't the least bit upset?

539
00:47:42.186 --> 00:47:43.770
I was grateful.

540
00:47:45.648 --> 00:47:47.941
Mrs. Mulwray,
you'll have to explain that.

541
00:47:48.025 --> 00:47:49.192
Why?

542
00:47:49.902 --> 00:47:52.278
Look, I do matrimonial work.
It's my métier.

543
00:47:52.363 --> 00:47:55.323
When a wife tells me that she's happy
that her husband is cheating on her,

544
00:47:55.407 --> 00:47:57.992
it runs contrary to my experience.

545
00:47:58.577 --> 00:48:00.078
Unless what?

546
00:48:02.748 --> 00:48:04.791
She was cheating on him.

547
00:48:07.419 --> 00:48:08.836
Were you?

548
00:48:13.926 --> 00:48:16.135
I dislike the word "cheat".

549
00:48:17.346 --> 00:48:18.846
Did you have affairs?

550
00:48:18.931 --> 00:48:21.641
- Mr. Gittes...
- Did he know about it?

551
00:48:23.143 --> 00:48:25.979
Well, I wouldn't run home and tell him
every time I went to bed with someone,

552
00:48:26.063 --> 00:48:28.147
if that's what you mean.

553
00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.900
Is there anything else you want
to know about me?

554
00:48:31.277 --> 00:48:34.028
Where were you
when your husband died?

555
00:48:34.613 --> 00:48:36.072
I can't tell you.

556
00:48:36.156 --> 00:48:37.740
You mean you don't know
where you were?

557
00:48:37.825 --> 00:48:41.160
- I mean I can't tell you.
- You were seeing someone, too.

558
00:48:42.955 --> 00:48:44.664
For very long?

559
00:48:44.748 --> 00:48:47.875
I don't see anyone
for very long, Mr. Gittes.

560
00:48:48.335 --> 00:48:50.336
It's difficult for me.

561
00:48:53.299 --> 00:48:57.218
Now, I think you know
all you need know about me.

562
00:48:58.804 --> 00:48:59.887
I didn't want publicity.

563
00:48:59.972 --> 00:49:03.308
I didn't want to go
into any of this, then or now.

564
00:49:04.184 --> 00:49:05.393
Is that all?

565
00:49:09.565 --> 00:49:13.151
By the way,
what does this "C" stand for?

566
00:49:15.404 --> 00:49:16.529
"Cross."

567
00:49:19.074 --> 00:49:21.451
- It's your maiden name?
- Yes.

568
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:23.077
Why?

569
00:49:23.787 --> 00:49:25.204
No reason.

570
00:49:25.539 --> 00:49:27.623
You must've had a reason
to ask me that.

571
00:49:27.708 --> 00:49:29.584
No. I'm just a snoop.

572
00:49:35.507 --> 00:49:38.843
No. I have my own car. The Packard.

573
00:49:38.927 --> 00:49:40.845
Wait a minute, sonny.

574
00:49:40.929 --> 00:49:43.097
I think you better come with me.

575
00:49:43.182 --> 00:49:45.433
But why? There's nothing more to say.

576
00:49:45.517 --> 00:49:47.810
Will you get my car, please?

577
00:49:50.481 --> 00:49:51.856
Okay, go home.

578
00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:55.735
But in case you're interested,
your husband was murdered.

579
00:49:55.819 --> 00:49:58.112
Somebody's been dumping
thousands of tons of water

580
00:49:58.197 --> 00:49:59.364
from the city's reservoirs,

581
00:49:59.448 --> 00:50:01.824
and we're supposed to be
in the middle of a drought.

582
00:50:01.909 --> 00:50:04.619
He found out about it,
and he was killed.

583
00:50:04.703 --> 00:50:06.579
There's a waterlogged drunk
in the morgue.

584
00:50:06.663 --> 00:50:09.165
Involuntary manslaughter,
if anybody wants to take the trouble,

585
00:50:09.249 --> 00:50:10.333
which they don't.

586
00:50:10.417 --> 00:50:12.668
It seems like half the city
is trying to cover it all up,

587
00:50:12.753 --> 00:50:14.629
which is fine by me.

588
00:50:15.923 --> 00:50:17.465
But, Mrs. Mulwray,

589
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:19.884
I goddamn near lost my nose,

590
00:50:19.968 --> 00:50:21.260
and I like it.

591
00:50:21.345 --> 00:50:23.262
I like breathing through it.

592
00:50:23.347 --> 00:50:26.557
And I still think
that you're hiding something.

593
00:50:35.234 --> 00:50:37.026
Mr. Gittes...

594
00:50:46.703 --> 00:50:49.622
J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.

595
00:51:19.862 --> 00:51:22.738
Mr. Yelburton will be
busy for some time.

596
00:51:23.073 --> 00:51:26.534
Well, it's my lunch hour. I can wait.

597
00:51:26.952 --> 00:51:29.787
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.

598
00:51:30.372 --> 00:51:32.498
I take a long lunch hour.

599
00:51:34.126 --> 00:51:36.544
All day, sometimes.

600
00:52:36.438 --> 00:52:38.981
Noah Cross worked
for the Water Department.

601
00:52:39.066 --> 00:52:40.399
Yes.

602
00:52:40.484 --> 00:52:42.777
- No.
- Well, did he or didn't he?

603
00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:44.862
He owned it.

604
00:52:46.114 --> 00:52:48.616
He owned the Water Department?

605
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.867
Yes.

606
00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:55.206
You mean, he owned
the entire water supply for the city?

607
00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:56.457
Yes.

608
00:53:01.547 --> 00:53:04.257
How did they get it away from him?

609
00:53:04.341 --> 00:53:07.802
Mr. Mulwray felt
the public should own the water.

610
00:53:07.886 --> 00:53:09.679
Mr. Mulwray?

611
00:53:09.763 --> 00:53:12.390
I thought you said Cross owned it.

612
00:53:12.474 --> 00:53:14.433
Along with Mr. Mulwray.

613
00:53:15.561 --> 00:53:19.480
- They were partners?
- Yes! Yes, they were partners.

614
00:53:57.227 --> 00:53:59.895
Mr. Yelburton will see you now.

615
00:54:05.444 --> 00:54:07.695
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.

616
00:54:07.779 --> 00:54:10.948
These staff meetings,
they just go on and on.

617
00:54:11.033 --> 00:54:15.286
Yeah. Must be especially tough
to take over under these circumstances.

618
00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:19.457
Yes. Hollis was the best
department chief the city's ever had.

619
00:54:20.167 --> 00:54:22.460
My goodness,
what happened to your nose?

620
00:54:22.544 --> 00:54:24.211
Cut myself shaving.

621
00:54:25.547 --> 00:54:28.549
Well, you ought to be more careful.
That must really smart.

622
00:54:28.675 --> 00:54:30.551
Only when I breathe.

623
00:54:34.723 --> 00:54:36.724
Only when you breathe.

624
00:54:37.392 --> 00:54:40.394
Don't tell me you're still working
for Mrs. Mulwray.

625
00:54:40.479 --> 00:54:42.855
- I never was.
- I don't understand.

626
00:54:43.899 --> 00:54:45.816
Neither do I, actually.

627
00:54:45.901 --> 00:54:47.401
You hired me.

628
00:54:48.362 --> 00:54:50.821
Or you hired that chippy to hire me.

629
00:54:51.406 --> 00:54:54.533
Mr. Gittes, you're not making
a bit of sense.

630
00:54:55.577 --> 00:54:57.828
Well, let's look at it this way.

631
00:54:57.913 --> 00:55:00.081
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.

632
00:55:00.207 --> 00:55:02.416
He had a reputation
that was hard to get around.

633
00:55:02.542 --> 00:55:04.335
You decided to ruin it.

634
00:55:04.419 --> 00:55:07.838
Then he found out
you were dumping water at night.

635
00:55:08.548 --> 00:55:10.091
Then he was...

636
00:55:10.425 --> 00:55:11.759
Drowned.

637
00:55:12.594 --> 00:55:15.513
Mr. Gittes,
that's an outrageous accusation.

638
00:55:15.597 --> 00:55:17.932
I don't know what you're talking about.

639
00:55:18.016 --> 00:55:21.852
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz
over at the Times will.

640
00:55:21.937 --> 00:55:24.522
Dumping thousands of gallons of water
down the toilet

641
00:55:24.606 --> 00:55:27.441
in the middle of a drought, that's news.

642
00:55:29.277 --> 00:55:30.945
Mr. Gittes,

643
00:55:31.905 --> 00:55:33.239
we're...

644
00:55:34.741 --> 00:55:37.868
We're not anxious for this to get around,
but we have been diverting a little water

645
00:55:37.953 --> 00:55:40.955
to irrigate orange groves
in the Northwest Valley.

646
00:55:41.039 --> 00:55:43.708
As you know, the farmers out there
have no legal right to our water,

647
00:55:43.792 --> 00:55:45.459
but we've been trying to help
some of them out,

648
00:55:45.544 --> 00:55:47.461
keep them from going under.

649
00:55:47.587 --> 00:55:51.298
Naturally, when you divert water,
there's a little run-off.

650
00:55:51.425 --> 00:55:53.551
Yeah. A little run-off.

651
00:55:54.302 --> 00:55:58.055
- Where'd you say those groves were?
- In the Northwest Valley.

652
00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:00.933
That's like saying they're in Arizona.

653
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:05.813
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out.
I can't give you the exact location.

654
00:56:06.314 --> 00:56:08.983
- You're a married man, aren't you?
- Yes.

655
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:12.111
Hard-working? Wife? Kids?

656
00:56:12.904 --> 00:56:14.155
Yes.

657
00:56:14.239 --> 00:56:16.323
I don't want to nail you.

658
00:56:21.246 --> 00:56:23.998
I want to find out who put you up to it.

659
00:56:24.124 --> 00:56:26.417
I'll give you a few
days to think about it.

660
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:28.335
Call me. I can help.

661
00:56:29.004 --> 00:56:30.171
Who knows?

662
00:56:30.255 --> 00:56:33.841
Maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big-shots,

663
00:56:33.925 --> 00:56:35.509
and you can stay
the head of the department

664
00:56:35.635 --> 00:56:37.511
for the next 20 years.

665
00:57:19.221 --> 00:57:21.639
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

666
00:57:26.895 --> 00:57:29.063
What is your usual salary?

667
00:57:29.981 --> 00:57:33.984
$35 a day, plus 20 to my associates,

668
00:57:34.653 --> 00:57:36.237
plus expenses,

669
00:57:37.155 --> 00:57:39.573
plus a bonus if I show results.

670
00:57:42.869 --> 00:57:46.664
Whoever is behind my husband's death,
why have they gone to all this trouble?

671
00:57:46.748 --> 00:57:47.998
Money.

672
00:57:48.834 --> 00:57:51.418
How they plan to make it
out of emptying reservoirs,

673
00:57:51.503 --> 00:57:53.254
that I don't know.

674
00:57:53.588 --> 00:57:55.422
I'll pay your salary,

675
00:57:55.507 --> 00:57:57.174
plus $5,000

676
00:57:57.592 --> 00:58:01.595
if you find out what happened to Hollis,
and who is involved.

677
00:58:05.892 --> 00:58:10.104
Sophie, draw up one of our
standard contracts for Mrs. Mulwray.

678
00:58:10.188 --> 00:58:11.939
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

679
00:58:15.735 --> 00:58:17.778
Tell me something.

680
00:58:17.904 --> 00:58:20.865
Did you get married before or after
Mulwray and your father

681
00:58:20.949 --> 00:58:23.117
sold the Water Department?

682
00:58:23.535 --> 00:58:26.203
Noah Cross is your father, isn't he?

683
00:58:28.874 --> 00:58:30.457
Yes, of course.

684
00:58:31.084 --> 00:58:33.043
It was sometime after.

685
00:58:33.962 --> 00:58:37.298
I was just out of grade school
when they did that.

686
00:58:38.967 --> 00:58:42.261
Then you married
your father's business partner.

687
00:58:44.973 --> 00:58:47.975
You've already got one going,
Mrs. Mulwray.

688
00:58:49.728 --> 00:58:53.647
Does my talking about your father
upset you?

689
00:58:53.773 --> 00:58:55.065
Why, no.

690
00:58:56.318 --> 00:58:57.902
Yes. A little.

691
00:58:57.986 --> 00:59:00.154
You see, Hollis and my...

692
00:59:01.656 --> 00:59:02.781
My father

693
00:59:03.408 --> 00:59:05.492
had a falling-out finally.

694
00:59:06.828 --> 00:59:09.830
Over you
or over the Water Department?

695
00:59:09.956 --> 00:59:12.166
Not over me. Why should it be over me?

696
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:13.918
Then it was over
the Water Department.

697
00:59:14.002 --> 00:59:15.002
Yes.

698
00:59:16.254 --> 00:59:18.672
Hollis felt that the water
should belong to the public,

699
00:59:18.798 --> 00:59:22.593
and I don't think my
father felt that way.

700
00:59:23.178 --> 00:59:25.846
Actually, it was over
the Van der Lip Dam.

701
00:59:25.972 --> 00:59:27.264
You know, the dam that broke?

702
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:30.768
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes. Hollis never forgave him for it.

703
00:59:30.852 --> 00:59:35.105
- Never forgave him for what?
- For talking him into building it.

704
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:37.816
They never spoke from that time on.

705
00:59:41.821 --> 00:59:43.697
You sure about that?

706
00:59:44.532 --> 00:59:46.367
Of course I'm sure.

707
00:59:51.206 --> 00:59:52.539
Sign here.

708
00:59:54.042 --> 00:59:55.876
The copy's for you.

709
01:00:57.939 --> 01:01:00.107
- Mr. Gitts?
- Gittes.

710
01:01:00.233 --> 01:01:01.275
Oh.

711
01:01:01.401 --> 01:01:02.943
How do you do?

712
01:01:03.528 --> 01:01:07.281
You've got a nasty reputation,
Mr. Gitts. I like that.

713
01:01:08.116 --> 01:01:09.283
Thanks.

714
01:01:09.367 --> 01:01:11.285
If you were a bank president,
that would be one thing,

715
01:01:11.369 --> 01:01:13.454
but in your business, it's admirable.

716
01:01:13.621 --> 01:01:15.539
And it's good advertising.

717
01:01:15.623 --> 01:01:16.707
It doesn't hurt.

718
01:01:16.791 --> 01:01:20.127
It's why you attracted
a client like my daughter.

719
01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.046
Probably.

720
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:23.964
But I'm surprised
you're still working for her,

721
01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:26.550
unless she's suddenly come up
with another husband.

722
01:01:26.634 --> 01:01:30.763
No. She happens to think
the last one was murdered.

723
01:01:32.724 --> 01:01:34.808
How'd she get that idea?

724
01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:37.478
I think I gave it to her.

725
01:01:38.605 --> 01:01:42.483
I hope you don't mind. I believe
they should be served with the head.

726
01:01:42.609 --> 01:01:45.861
Fine. Long as you don't serve
chicken that way.

727
01:01:47.947 --> 01:01:51.158
Tell me, what do the police say?

728
01:01:51.284 --> 01:01:53.660
They're calling it an accident.

729
01:01:54.704 --> 01:01:58.749
- Who's the investigating officer?
- Lou Escobar. He's a lieutenant.

730
01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:01.460
- Do you know him?
- Oh, yeah.

731
01:02:01.961 --> 01:02:03.378
Where from?

732
01:02:04.172 --> 01:02:06.965
We used to work together.
In Chinatown.

733
01:02:08.885 --> 01:02:11.345
Would you call him a capable man?

734
01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.347
Very.

735
01:02:13.848 --> 01:02:15.140
Honest?

736
01:02:15.475 --> 01:02:16.892
As far as it goes.

737
01:02:17.727 --> 01:02:20.854
Of course, he has to swim
in the same water we all do.

738
01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.566
Of course, but you've no reason to think
he's bungled the case?

739
01:02:24.692 --> 01:02:27.027
- None.
- That's too bad.

740
01:02:27.904 --> 01:02:29.321
- Too bad?
- Hmm.

741
01:02:30.031 --> 01:02:33.659
It disturbs me. Makes me think
you're taking my daughter for a ride.

742
01:02:33.743 --> 01:02:36.203
Financially speaking, of course.

743
01:02:37.163 --> 01:02:39.248
What are you charging her?

744
01:02:41.042 --> 01:02:45.045
My usual fee,
plus a bonus if I get results.

745
01:02:45.171 --> 01:02:47.256
Are you sleeping with her?

746
01:02:49.759 --> 01:02:50.843
Come, come, Mr. Gitts.

747
01:02:50.927 --> 01:02:54.680
You don't have to think about that
to remember, do you?

748
01:02:56.391 --> 01:02:58.517
If you want an answer
to that question, Mr. Cross,

749
01:02:58.601 --> 01:03:01.228
I'll put one of my men on the job.

750
01:03:02.772 --> 01:03:04.606
- Good afternoon.
- Mr. Gitts...

751
01:03:04.732 --> 01:03:06.400
- Gittes.
- Gittes.

752
01:03:07.193 --> 01:03:10.404
You're dealing with a disturbed woman
who just lost her husband.

753
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:12.948
I don't want her taken advantage of.

754
01:03:13.074 --> 01:03:14.908
- Sit down.
- What for?

755
01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.998
You may think you know
what you're dealing with,

756
01:03:21.082 --> 01:03:23.250
but believe me, you don't.

757
01:03:24.252 --> 01:03:25.961
Why is that funny?

758
01:03:26.087 --> 01:03:29.214
It's what the District Attorney
used to tell me in Chinatown.

759
01:03:29.299 --> 01:03:31.133
Yeah? Was he right?

760
01:03:32.468 --> 01:03:35.470
Exactly what do you know about me?
Sit down.

761
01:03:41.144 --> 01:03:42.936
Mainly that you're rich,

762
01:03:43.062 --> 01:03:46.648
and too respectable
to want your name in the newspapers.

763
01:03:46.774 --> 01:03:49.443
Of course I'm respectable. I'm old.

764
01:03:51.112 --> 01:03:52.863
Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores

765
01:03:52.947 --> 01:03:56.116
all get respectable
if they last long enough.

766
01:03:56.618 --> 01:03:59.912
I'll double whatever your fee is
and pay you $10,000

767
01:03:59.996 --> 01:04:02.456
if you find Hollis' girlfriend.

768
01:04:02.957 --> 01:04:05.667
- Girlfriend?
- Disappeared, hasn't she?

769
01:04:05.793 --> 01:04:06.960
Yeah.

770
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:10.214
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?

771
01:04:10.298 --> 01:04:11.590
Maybe.

772
01:04:13.301 --> 01:04:14.343
If Mulwray was murdered,

773
01:04:14.469 --> 01:04:17.679
she'd be one of the last
to have seen him alive.

774
01:04:17.972 --> 01:04:20.682
When's the last time you saw Mulwray?

775
01:04:22.101 --> 01:04:24.394
Sheriff's gold posse.
Bunch of damn fools

776
01:04:24.479 --> 01:04:28.482
who pay $5,000 apiece
towards the Sheriff's re-election.

777
01:04:29.025 --> 01:04:31.485
I let them practice up out here.

778
01:04:32.654 --> 01:04:33.820
Yeah.

779
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:38.450
Do you remember the last time
you saw Mulwray?

780
01:04:38.534 --> 01:04:41.119
At my age, you tend to forget.

781
01:04:42.497 --> 01:04:45.207
It was five days ago outside
The Pig'n Whistle,

782
01:04:45.333 --> 01:04:48.043
and you had one hell of an argument.

783
01:04:48.169 --> 01:04:52.172
I got the pictures in my office,
if that'll help you remember.

784
01:04:55.176 --> 01:04:58.220
- What was the argument about?
- My daughter.

785
01:05:00.056 --> 01:05:01.682
What about her?

786
01:05:02.225 --> 01:05:06.061
Just find the girl, Mr. Gitts.

787
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:13.193
I happen to know Hollis was fond of her.

788
01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:16.154
I'd like to help her if I can.

789
01:05:16.239 --> 01:05:20.158
I had no idea you and Hollis
were that fond of one another.

790
01:05:21.035 --> 01:05:23.370
Hollis Mulwray made this city,

791
01:05:24.038 --> 01:05:26.206
and he made me a fortune.

792
01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:31.044
We were a lot closer
than Evelyn realized.

793
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:38.510
If you want to hire me, I still have to
know what the argument was about.

794
01:05:39.721 --> 01:05:41.972
My daughter's a very jealous woman.

795
01:05:42.056 --> 01:05:45.183
I didn't want her to find out
about the girl.

796
01:05:45.393 --> 01:05:47.227
How did you find out?

797
01:05:47.353 --> 01:05:51.606
I still got a few teeth left in my head,
and a few friends in town.

798
01:05:54.569 --> 01:05:55.736
Okay.

799
01:05:57.447 --> 01:05:58.739
I'll...

800
01:06:00.116 --> 01:06:03.076
I'll have my secretary
draw up the papers.

801
01:06:03.745 --> 01:06:05.078
Tell me,

802
01:06:06.205 --> 01:06:10.250
are you frightened for the girl
or what Evelyn might do to her?

803
01:06:10.376 --> 01:06:12.210
Just find the girl.

804
01:06:13.713 --> 01:06:15.422
I'll look into it,

805
01:06:15.548 --> 01:06:18.717
as soon as I've checked out
some orange groves.

806
01:06:19.635 --> 01:06:21.219
Orange groves?

807
01:06:22.221 --> 01:06:24.556
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.

808
01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:31.772
I'm a little lost.
I wonder if you could tell me

809
01:06:31.898 --> 01:06:34.608
where the plat books
for the Northwest Valley are?

810
01:06:34.734 --> 01:06:36.526
Part of it's in Ventura County.

811
01:06:36.611 --> 01:06:40.113
We don't have Ventura County
in our Hall of Records.

812
01:06:40.573 --> 01:06:43.784
Well, then, I'll settle
for Los Angeles County.

813
01:06:44.619 --> 01:06:46.328
Row 23, section C.

814
01:06:50.792 --> 01:06:52.084
Weasel.

815
01:07:47.515 --> 01:07:48.974
Say, sonny,

816
01:07:51.185 --> 01:07:54.813
why do they have all those names
pasted in the plat books?

817
01:07:54.897 --> 01:07:58.400
Land sales out of escrow
are always recorded within the week.

818
01:07:58.526 --> 01:08:01.695
- Then these are all new owners?
- That's right.

819
01:08:02.864 --> 01:08:06.324
Well, that means that most of the Valley
sold in the last few months.

820
01:08:06.409 --> 01:08:08.410
If that's what it says.

821
01:08:10.037 --> 01:08:12.706
Can I check one of these volumes out?

822
01:08:13.666 --> 01:08:17.711
Sir, this is not a lending library.
It's the Hall of Records.

823
01:08:17.837 --> 01:08:20.755
- How about a ruler?
- A ruler?

824
01:08:21.757 --> 01:08:25.010
Yeah. The print's real fine.
I left my glasses home.

825
01:08:25.094 --> 01:08:27.721
I'd like to be able to read across.

826
01:08:39.609 --> 01:08:41.234
Why, thank you.

827
01:09:48.427 --> 01:09:50.178
Hold it right there!

828
01:10:58.706 --> 01:11:01.041
All right, quit it. Quit, now!

829
01:11:01.167 --> 01:11:03.710
Search the man. See if he's armed.

830
01:11:16.724 --> 01:11:19.934
I said see if he's armed,
not empty his pockets!

831
01:11:20.311 --> 01:11:22.312
Search him. Search him!

832
01:11:23.481 --> 01:11:25.273
He ain't armed.

833
01:11:25.399 --> 01:11:26.858
All right, mister, who you with,

834
01:11:26.942 --> 01:11:30.111
the Water Department
or the Real Estate Office?

835
01:11:30.905 --> 01:11:32.447
- Get away from me!
- Answer him!

836
01:11:32.573 --> 01:11:33.948
You come near me
with that thing again,

837
01:11:34.075 --> 01:11:35.116
you're gonna need a pair of them!

838
01:11:35.242 --> 01:11:37.035
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

839
01:11:37.119 --> 01:11:41.081
I said cut that out! Give
the man a chance to say something!

840
01:11:44.752 --> 01:11:48.421
The name's Gittes.
I'm a private investigator.

841
01:11:48.506 --> 01:11:50.256
I'm not with either one of them.

842
01:11:51.425 --> 01:11:53.802
Then what you doing out here, mister?

843
01:11:54.095 --> 01:11:56.137
A client hired me to see...

844
01:11:57.181 --> 01:11:59.974
To see if the Water Department
was irrigating your land.

845
01:12:00.101 --> 01:12:01.768
Irrigating my land?

846
01:12:01.852 --> 01:12:03.478
The Water Department's been sending
you people out here

847
01:12:03.604 --> 01:12:06.314
to blow up my water tanks,
they put poison down three of my wells.

848
01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.525
I call that a funny way to irrigate.

849
01:12:08.609 --> 01:12:11.361
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?

850
01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:17.867
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

851
01:12:17.952 --> 01:12:20.954
Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch
who's done it to us.

852
01:12:21.038 --> 01:12:25.625
Mulwray's dead. You don't know what
you're talking about, you dumb Okie.

853
01:12:33.008 --> 01:12:35.135
Well, that's that.

854
01:13:02.204 --> 01:13:03.872
What's going on?

855
01:13:04.331 --> 01:13:05.957
You didn't look too good,

856
01:13:06.041 --> 01:13:09.043
so we thought we better call
your employer.

857
01:13:13.549 --> 01:13:15.341
Thanks for coming.

858
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:22.599
- That dam's a con job.
- What dam?

859
01:13:22.683 --> 01:13:26.436
The one your husband opposed.
They're conning L.A. into building it.

860
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.272
But the water's not gonna go to L.A.,
it's coming right here.

861
01:13:29.356 --> 01:13:30.565
To the Valley?

862
01:13:30.691 --> 01:13:33.109
Everything you can see.
Everything around us.

863
01:13:33.194 --> 01:13:35.737
I was at the Hall of Records today.

864
01:13:41.911 --> 01:13:45.705
In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres,

865
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:49.501
Emma Dill, 12,000,
Clarence Speer, 5,000,

866
01:13:49.585 --> 01:13:52.796
and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres.

867
01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.881
- Jasper Lamar Crabb?
- You know him?

868
01:13:54.965 --> 01:13:58.718
- I think I would've remembered.
- Yeah.

869
01:13:58.803 --> 01:14:00.637
They're blowing these farmers
out of their land

870
01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:02.180
and then picking it up for peanuts.

871
01:14:02.264 --> 01:14:06.851
You have any idea what this land would
be worth with a steady water supply?

872
01:14:06.936 --> 01:14:09.938
About $30 million more
than they paid for it.

873
01:14:11.732 --> 01:14:15.109
- Hollis knew about this?
- That's why he was killed.

874
01:14:17.071 --> 01:14:18.905
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

875
01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.741
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

876
01:14:24.245 --> 01:14:25.954
- We got it!
- What?

877
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.622
- We got it.
- What? What is it?

878
01:14:27.748 --> 01:14:30.750
"A memorial service was held
at the Mar Vista Inn today

879
01:14:30.835 --> 01:14:31.960
"for Jasper Lamar Crabb."

880
01:14:32.086 --> 01:14:34.462
He passed away two weeks ago.

881
01:14:35.422 --> 01:14:37.131
Why is that unusual?

882
01:14:37.591 --> 01:14:41.302
He passed away two weeks ago,
and one week ago he bought the land.

883
01:14:41.428 --> 01:14:43.012
That's unusual.

884
01:15:26.807 --> 01:15:30.184
Hello, there. I'm Mr. Palmer.
Can I help you folks?

885
01:15:30.644 --> 01:15:32.478
Yes, I hope so.

886
01:15:33.814 --> 01:15:35.148
It's Dad.

887
01:15:35.649 --> 01:15:37.275
I can't seem to handle him anymore.

888
01:15:37.359 --> 01:15:39.694
- Can I, sweetheart?
- My goodness.

889
01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:42.322
Nothing with Dad. It's me.

890
01:15:42.406 --> 01:15:44.991
Oh, no, no, Dad is an absolute angel
with everyone else.

891
01:15:45.075 --> 01:15:48.161
- It's just that he and my...
- Oh, I don't know.

892
01:15:48.245 --> 01:15:51.122
Of course, I'm anxious
for him to have the best,

893
01:15:51.206 --> 01:15:52.999
and money is no object.

894
01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:55.835
Perhaps if we met with your father.

895
01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:59.172
- There is one question.
- Of course.

896
01:15:59.256 --> 01:16:02.425
Do you accept people
of the Jewish persuasion?

897
01:16:03.177 --> 01:16:05.053
I'm sorry, but we don't.

898
01:16:05.179 --> 01:16:06.804
Don't be sorry. Neither does Dad.

899
01:16:06.889 --> 01:16:09.849
We just wanted to be sure,
didn't we, hon?

900
01:16:10.017 --> 01:16:14.270
Would it be possible for me to see a list
of your patients, just to be certain?

901
01:16:14.355 --> 01:16:18.483
We never reveal the names
of our guests as a matter of policy.

902
01:16:18.567 --> 01:16:20.693
You would appreciate that
if your father came to live with us.

903
01:16:20.778 --> 01:16:24.030
That's exactly
what I wanted to hear you say.

904
01:16:24.114 --> 01:16:25.239
Good.

905
01:16:25.366 --> 01:16:27.700
I wonder, is it too late
for us to have a look around?

906
01:16:27.785 --> 01:16:29.077
No. Allow me to show you.

907
01:16:29.203 --> 01:16:31.788
Would you mind
if we took a stroll on our own?

908
01:16:31.872 --> 01:16:34.290
Just if you'll confine yourself
to the main building.

909
01:16:34.375 --> 01:16:36.125
It's almost bedtime.

910
01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:39.462
We understand. Come, my sweet.

911
01:16:51.892 --> 01:16:54.477
Charlie! You ought to know
better than that!

912
01:16:54.561 --> 01:16:56.562
Sit down. Have a chair.

913
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:19.419
They're all there. Every goddamn name.

914
01:17:25.467 --> 01:17:29.012
You're looking at the owners
of a 50,000-acre empire.

915
01:17:29.096 --> 01:17:30.638
They can't be.

916
01:17:35.144 --> 01:17:37.770
They may not know it, but they are.

917
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.149
- Hello, girls.
- Hello.

918
01:17:41.275 --> 01:17:43.776
- Hello.
- Are any of you Emma Dill?

919
01:17:45.446 --> 01:17:48.072
- Yes? Are you Emma?
- Yes.

920
01:17:48.157 --> 01:17:50.742
Well, I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.

921
01:17:50.826 --> 01:17:51.868
Why?

922
01:17:51.952 --> 01:17:54.162
Did you know you were
a very wealthy woman?

923
01:17:54.288 --> 01:17:56.080
Oh, I'm not.

924
01:17:56.165 --> 01:18:00.293
- Yes, you are. You own a lot of land.
- No more.

925
01:18:01.045 --> 01:18:02.295
Some time ago,

926
01:18:02.379 --> 01:18:06.424
my late husband owned a good deal
of beach property at Long Beach,

927
01:18:06.508 --> 01:18:08.134
but we lost it.

928
01:18:08.552 --> 01:18:11.137
- That's very beautiful.
- Thanks.

929
01:18:11.805 --> 01:18:13.806
Where did you get
this piece of material?

930
01:18:13.891 --> 01:18:15.808
At the Abbacore Club.

931
01:18:16.143 --> 01:18:19.729
- Abbacore?
- No. The Albacore.

932
01:18:19.813 --> 01:18:21.773
It's a fish.

933
01:18:21.857 --> 01:18:26.569
My grandson is a member,
and they take very nice care of us.

934
01:18:26.653 --> 01:18:28.571
How do they do that?

935
01:18:28.655 --> 01:18:32.825
Oh, give us things,
not just like this old flag, but...

936
01:18:33.327 --> 01:18:34.368
But what?

937
01:18:34.495 --> 01:18:37.830
We're a sort of unofficial charity
of theirs, Mr. Gittes.

938
01:18:38.916 --> 01:18:43.044
Would you come with me, please?
Someone wants to talk with you.

939
01:18:45.756 --> 01:18:46.798
Goodbye, ladies.

940
01:18:46.882 --> 01:18:47.924
- Bye!
- Bye!

941
01:18:56.183 --> 01:18:59.185
Come on.
I want you to meet someone, Gittes.

942
01:18:59.269 --> 01:19:01.479
Can we leave the lady out of this?

943
01:19:01.563 --> 01:19:04.774
- Yeah. Why not?
- I'd like to see her to the car.

944
01:19:04.858 --> 01:19:07.610
- She knows where it's at.
- I'll stay.

945
01:19:08.362 --> 01:19:09.946
Get in the car.

946
01:20:30.611 --> 01:20:32.320
Maid's night off?

947
01:20:33.614 --> 01:20:36.240
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

948
01:20:36.325 --> 01:20:40.286
- Nobody's here, that's why.
- I gave everyone the night off.

949
01:20:41.121 --> 01:20:43.331
Easy. It's an innocent question.

950
01:20:43.457 --> 01:20:46.500
No question from you
is innocent, Mr. Gittes.

951
01:20:46.627 --> 01:20:48.502
I guess you're right.

952
01:20:51.548 --> 01:20:53.466
To you, Mrs. Mulwray.

953
01:20:54.801 --> 01:20:57.303
Frankly, tonight, you saved my...

954
01:20:57.554 --> 01:20:59.388
You saved my neck.

955
01:21:02.517 --> 01:21:04.352
Tell me, Mr. Gittes,

956
01:21:05.687 --> 01:21:08.064
does this often happen to you?

957
01:21:09.650 --> 01:21:11.150
What's that?

958
01:21:12.027 --> 01:21:14.820
Well, I'm judging only on the basis
of one afternoon and an evening,

959
01:21:14.905 --> 01:21:17.114
but if this is how you go
about your work,

960
01:21:17.199 --> 01:21:20.993
I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a whole day.

961
01:21:22.663 --> 01:21:25.456
Actually, this hasn't happened to me
for a long time.

962
01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:27.541
When was the last time?

963
01:21:28.168 --> 01:21:29.252
Why?

964
01:21:30.003 --> 01:21:32.171
It's an innocent question.

965
01:21:36.843 --> 01:21:40.179
- In Chinatown.
- What were you doing there?

966
01:21:42.516 --> 01:21:45.977
- Working for the District Attorney.
- Doing what?

967
01:21:46.061 --> 01:21:47.812
As little as possible.

968
01:21:47.896 --> 01:21:51.399
The District Attorney gives his men
advice like that?

969
01:21:52.234 --> 01:21:54.193
They do in Chinatown.

970
01:21:55.279 --> 01:21:57.905
Why did you leave the police force?

971
01:22:01.535 --> 01:22:06.998
Do you have any peroxide,
or anything like that?

972
01:22:07.082 --> 01:22:09.709
Surely. Will you come this way?

973
01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:28.769
My God!

974
01:22:32.232 --> 01:22:33.941
It's a nasty cut.

975
01:22:35.902 --> 01:22:37.611
I had no idea...

976
01:22:42.659 --> 01:22:43.909
Sorry!

977
01:22:45.078 --> 01:22:46.329
There.

978
01:22:47.414 --> 01:22:48.956
Is it painful?

979
01:22:49.082 --> 01:22:51.125
Uh-huh.

980
01:22:52.419 --> 01:22:54.253
It must be painful.

981
01:22:56.256 --> 01:22:57.757
What's wrong?

982
01:22:58.592 --> 01:22:59.925
Your eye.

983
01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:04.972
What about it? What?

984
01:23:05.599 --> 01:23:09.143
There's something black
in the green part of your eye.

985
01:23:09.853 --> 01:23:11.020
Oh, that.

986
01:23:11.605 --> 01:23:15.858
It's a flaw in the iris.

987
01:23:17.152 --> 01:23:19.320
- A flaw?
- Yes.

988
01:23:20.655 --> 01:23:22.782
A sort of birthmark.

989
01:23:58.527 --> 01:24:00.528
Did you wear a uniform?

990
01:24:02.197 --> 01:24:03.656
Sometimes.

991
01:24:05.659 --> 01:24:07.993
Must have looked cute in blue.

992
01:24:09.996 --> 01:24:12.039
Give me a break, will you?

993
01:24:12.541 --> 01:24:14.250
I don't know you.

994
01:24:15.544 --> 01:24:17.920
I want to know more about you.

995
01:24:18.505 --> 01:24:19.839
Not now.

996
01:24:22.050 --> 01:24:25.553
You really don't like to talk
about the past, do you?

997
01:24:28.056 --> 01:24:29.432
I'm tired.

998
01:24:30.267 --> 01:24:33.269
No. Why does it bother you
to talk about it?

999
01:24:33.895 --> 01:24:37.106
- It bothers everybody that works there.
- Where?

1000
01:24:38.108 --> 01:24:40.025
Chinatown. Everybody.

1001
01:24:41.361 --> 01:24:43.696
To me, it was just bad luck.

1002
01:24:43.947 --> 01:24:45.114
Why?

1003
01:24:47.951 --> 01:24:50.744
You can't always tell what's going on.

1004
01:24:52.873 --> 01:24:54.415
Like with you.

1005
01:25:03.925 --> 01:25:05.384
Why was...

1006
01:25:07.721 --> 01:25:09.555
Why was it bad luck?

1007
01:25:14.311 --> 01:25:17.438
I was trying to keep someone
from being hurt.

1008
01:25:18.064 --> 01:25:20.983
I ended up making sure
that she was hurt.

1009
01:25:29.242 --> 01:25:31.827
Was there a woman involved?

1010
01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:34.997
Of course.

1011
01:25:36.625 --> 01:25:37.791
Dead?

1012
01:25:51.139 --> 01:25:52.515
Yes, hello?

1013
01:25:55.435 --> 01:25:59.230
Oh, my God.
No, look, don't do anything.

1014
01:25:59.314 --> 01:26:01.941
Don't do anything until I get there.

1015
01:26:06.029 --> 01:26:08.822
I have to go.

1016
01:26:09.449 --> 01:26:13.160
- Where?
- Just that I have to.

1017
01:26:13.662 --> 01:26:17.623
- I want to know where you're going.
- No, please. Don't be angry.

1018
01:26:17.707 --> 01:26:20.626
It has nothing to do with you
or with any of all of this. It's just...

1019
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:23.128
- Where are you going?
- Please...

1020
01:26:26.049 --> 01:26:27.841
Trust me this much.

1021
01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:39.979
I'll be back.

1022
01:26:45.443 --> 01:26:47.027
And there is...

1023
01:26:48.738 --> 01:26:51.407
There is something
that I should tell you about.

1024
01:26:51.491 --> 01:26:55.744
The fishing club
that old lady mentioned...

1025
01:26:57.330 --> 01:27:00.374
- The pieces of the flag... Yes.
- The Albacore Club.

1026
01:27:00.458 --> 01:27:03.127
- It has to do with my father.
- I know.

1027
01:27:03.211 --> 01:27:05.754
He owns it... You know?

1028
01:27:06.715 --> 01:27:08.090
I saw him.

1029
01:27:11.678 --> 01:27:13.137
You saw

1030
01:27:14.097 --> 01:27:15.431
my father?

1031
01:27:18.852 --> 01:27:21.770
- What... When?
- This morning.

1032
01:27:24.858 --> 01:27:26.609
You didn't tell me.

1033
01:27:26.943 --> 01:27:29.486
Well, there hasn't been much time.

1034
01:27:29.988 --> 01:27:31.196
What...

1035
01:27:31.906 --> 01:27:33.574
What did he say?

1036
01:27:39.039 --> 01:27:40.664
What did he say?

1037
01:27:41.166 --> 01:27:43.125
That you were jealous.

1038
01:27:44.711 --> 01:27:46.754
And that he was afraid
what you might do.

1039
01:27:46.838 --> 01:27:49.048
Do? To whom?

1040
01:27:50.258 --> 01:27:52.593
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one.

1041
01:27:54.971 --> 01:27:57.348
He wanted to know where she was.

1042
01:28:00.518 --> 01:28:02.561
I want you to listen to me.

1043
01:28:02.646 --> 01:28:07.232
Now, my father is
a very dangerous man.

1044
01:28:07.317 --> 01:28:10.986
You don't know how dangerous.
You don't know how crazy.

1045
01:28:12.155 --> 01:28:15.574
Are you trying to tell me
that he might be behind all this?

1046
01:28:15.659 --> 01:28:17.201
It's possible.

1047
01:28:23.667 --> 01:28:26.293
Even the death of your husband?

1048
01:28:26.378 --> 01:28:27.920
It's possible.

1049
01:28:28.129 --> 01:28:30.381
Now, please,
don't ask me anymore questions now,

1050
01:28:30.465 --> 01:28:32.633
just wait. Wait for me here.

1051
01:28:33.718 --> 01:28:35.427
I need you here.

1052
01:31:44.576 --> 01:31:45.993
No, no. Here.

1053
01:32:15.398 --> 01:32:17.107
Give me the keys.

1054
01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.444
You...

1055
01:32:20.528 --> 01:32:23.989
It's either that
or you drive yourself to the police.

1056
01:32:24.073 --> 01:32:25.490
The police?

1057
01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.492
Come on, Mrs. Mulwray.

1058
01:32:27.577 --> 01:32:31.204
You've got your husband's girlfriend
tied up in there.

1059
01:32:31.289 --> 01:32:33.624
- She's not tied up.
- You know what I mean.

1060
01:32:33.708 --> 01:32:36.960
- You're holding her against her will.
- I am not!

1061
01:32:38.004 --> 01:32:40.756
- Okay. Then let's go talk to her.
- No!

1062
01:32:42.467 --> 01:32:43.759
She's...

1063
01:32:43.968 --> 01:32:45.677
She's too upset.

1064
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:48.889
What about?

1065
01:32:49.515 --> 01:32:51.058
Hollis's death.

1066
01:32:52.101 --> 01:32:53.352
I tried to keep it from her.

1067
01:32:53.436 --> 01:32:57.981
I didn't want her to know until
I could make plans for us to leave.

1068
01:32:58.066 --> 01:33:00.776
You mean she just found out about it?

1069
01:33:02.904 --> 01:33:05.864
That's not what it looks like,
Mrs. Mulwray.

1070
01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.241
What does it look like?

1071
01:33:08.409 --> 01:33:11.578
Like she knows more
than you want her to tell.

1072
01:33:13.081 --> 01:33:14.706
You're insane.

1073
01:33:14.791 --> 01:33:17.334
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not the police.

1074
01:33:17.418 --> 01:33:21.088
I don't care what you've done.
I don't want to hurt you.

1075
01:33:25.176 --> 01:33:27.552
You won't go to the
police if I tell you?

1076
01:33:27.637 --> 01:33:29.471
I will if you don't.

1077
01:33:43.611 --> 01:33:44.861
She...

1078
01:33:44.946 --> 01:33:46.196
She...

1079
01:33:47.073 --> 01:33:48.240
She...

1080
01:33:49.492 --> 01:33:51.159
She's my sister.

1081
01:33:57.542 --> 01:33:59.084
Take it easy.

1082
01:33:59.836 --> 01:34:02.671
If she's your sister, she's your sister.

1083
01:34:03.297 --> 01:34:05.132
Why all the secrecy?

1084
01:34:07.301 --> 01:34:08.552
I can't.

1085
01:34:08.636 --> 01:34:13.265
Is it because of Hollis? Because she
was seeing your husband? Is that it?

1086
01:34:17.311 --> 01:34:19.813
I would never have harmed Hollis.

1087
01:34:20.773 --> 01:34:24.568
He was the most gentle,
decent man imaginable.

1088
01:34:26.821 --> 01:34:30.741
And he put up with more from me
than you'll ever know.

1089
01:34:33.077 --> 01:34:36.830
I wanted him to be happy.

1090
01:34:55.725 --> 01:34:59.936
I borrowed your husband's car.
I'll bring it back in the morning.

1091
01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:02.814
But aren't you going...
Coming back with me?

1092
01:35:02.899 --> 01:35:05.859
Don't worry. I'm not going
to tell anybody about this.

1093
01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:09.821
That's not what I meant.

1094
01:35:13.159 --> 01:35:14.326
Yeah.

1095
01:35:15.203 --> 01:35:18.914
Well, I'm tired, Mrs. Mulwray.

1096
01:35:20.083 --> 01:35:21.541
Good night.

1097
01:36:26.899 --> 01:36:28.150
Gittes?

1098
01:36:29.485 --> 01:36:31.027
- Gittes?
- Yeah?

1099
01:36:31.571 --> 01:36:33.947
Ida Sessions wants to see you.

1100
01:36:34.031 --> 01:36:37.742
- Who?
- Ida Sessions. You remember Ida.

1101
01:36:39.245 --> 01:36:41.496
- Yeah, I do?
- Sure, you do.

1102
01:36:45.001 --> 01:36:46.918
I tell you what, pal.

1103
01:36:48.004 --> 01:36:52.382
If Ida wants to see me,
she can call me at my office.

1104
01:37:19.285 --> 01:37:23.872
848-1/2 East Kensington. Echo Park.

1105
01:37:23.956 --> 01:37:26.291
She begged me to call.
She's waiting for you.

1106
01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:37.065
Find anything interesting, Gittes?

1107
01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.405
What are you doing around here?

1108
01:40:43.489 --> 01:40:45.323
Didn't you call me?

1109
01:40:47.076 --> 01:40:49.494
How come you happen to know her?

1110
01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:51.204
I don't.

1111
01:40:54.041 --> 01:40:56.793
Come here.
I want to show you something.

1112
01:41:06.053 --> 01:41:09.013
- Isn't that your phone number?
- Is it?

1113
01:41:09.098 --> 01:41:11.349
I forget. I don't call
myself that often.

1114
01:41:11.434 --> 01:41:14.477
Well, just to make sure,
we had Loach here give you a call.

1115
01:41:14.562 --> 01:41:16.229
What happened to your nose, Gittes?

1116
01:41:16.313 --> 01:41:18.481
Somebody slam
a bedroom window on it?

1117
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:24.821
Nope. Your wife got excited.
She crossed her legs a little too quick.

1118
01:41:24.905 --> 01:41:26.781
You understand what I mean, pal?

1119
01:41:27.658 --> 01:41:28.867
Loach.

1120
01:41:49.263 --> 01:41:51.055
They look familiar?

1121
01:41:52.224 --> 01:41:55.560
- Yeah. I took them. So what?
- How did she happen to have them?

1122
01:41:55.644 --> 01:41:59.272
Either you tell me or I guess.
I don't know the answer.

1123
01:41:59.607 --> 01:42:01.900
You must really think I'm stupid,
don't you, Gittes?

1124
01:42:01.984 --> 01:42:03.443
I don't think about it that much,

1125
01:42:03.527 --> 01:42:06.571
but give me a day or two
and I'll get back to you.

1126
01:42:06.655 --> 01:42:10.200
- Now I'd like to go home.
- I want the other pictures, Gittes.

1127
01:42:10.284 --> 01:42:11.826
What pictures?

1128
01:42:12.578 --> 01:42:16.039
This broad hired you,
not Evelyn Mulwray.

1129
01:42:16.123 --> 01:42:17.582
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1130
01:42:18.667 --> 01:42:20.376
Somebody wanted
to shake Mulwray down,

1131
01:42:20.461 --> 01:42:22.045
she hired you.

1132
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:24.631
That's how come you found out
he was murdered.

1133
01:42:24.715 --> 01:42:27.759
- I heard it was an accident.
- Come on, Gittes.

1134
01:42:27.843 --> 01:42:31.221
Who the hell do you think you're
dealing with, a bunch of assholes?

1135
01:42:31.305 --> 01:42:33.640
Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.

1136
01:42:35.684 --> 01:42:38.645
You were following him day and night.
You saw who killed him.

1137
01:42:38.729 --> 01:42:40.772
You even took pictures of it.

1138
01:42:40.856 --> 01:42:42.023
It was Evelyn Mulwray,

1139
01:42:42.107 --> 01:42:45.360
and she's been paying you off
like a slot machine ever since.

1140
01:42:45.444 --> 01:42:48.238
- You accusing me of extortion?
- Absolutely.

1141
01:42:48.322 --> 01:42:50.031
I don't think I need a day or two.

1142
01:42:50.115 --> 01:42:52.283
You're dumber than you think
I think you are.

1143
01:42:52.368 --> 01:42:55.411
Not only that, but I wouldn't extort
a nickel from my worst enemy, Escobar.

1144
01:42:55.496 --> 01:42:57.121
That's where I draw the line.

1145
01:42:57.206 --> 01:42:59.374
I want the rest of the pictures, Gittes.

1146
01:42:59.458 --> 01:43:01.209
We're talking about accessory
after the fact,

1147
01:43:01.293 --> 01:43:03.002
conspiracy, and extortion, minimum.

1148
01:43:03.087 --> 01:43:05.547
What do you think, Evelyn Mulwray
knocked off her husband in the ocean,

1149
01:43:05.631 --> 01:43:06.965
then dragged him up to a reservoir

1150
01:43:07.049 --> 01:43:09.884
because she thought
it would look more like an accident?

1151
01:43:11.303 --> 01:43:12.637
Mulwray was murdered and moved

1152
01:43:12.721 --> 01:43:16.474
because somebody didn't want his body
found in the ocean.

1153
01:43:16.559 --> 01:43:17.600
Why is that?

1154
01:43:17.685 --> 01:43:19.644
He found out
they were dumping water there.

1155
01:43:19.728 --> 01:43:22.689
That's what they were
trying to cover up.

1156
01:43:23.607 --> 01:43:27.569
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come on. I'll show you.

1157
01:43:28.779 --> 01:43:32.031
Come on, Lou.
You're in charge. Make a decision.

1158
01:43:50.134 --> 01:43:51.884
- It's too late.
- Too late for what?

1159
01:43:51.969 --> 01:43:54.554
They only dump the water at night.

1160
01:43:56.265 --> 01:43:59.267
- Reach anybody?
- Yelburton. He's the new chief.

1161
01:43:59.351 --> 01:44:02.103
- Yeah, I know who he is. Go on!
- He says...

1162
01:44:02.187 --> 01:44:04.564
- I know what he says.
- Shut up.

1163
01:44:06.066 --> 01:44:07.150
Go on!

1164
01:44:07.234 --> 01:44:09.110
Yelburton says there's irrigation
in the Valley,

1165
01:44:09.194 --> 01:44:11.404
and there's always a little run-off
after they do that.

1166
01:44:11.488 --> 01:44:13.031
And he says Gittes knows this,

1167
01:44:13.115 --> 01:44:17.619
and he's been going around making
irresponsible accusations all last week.

1168
01:44:17.703 --> 01:44:19.412
Lou, let's swear out a warrant
for her arrest.

1169
01:44:19.496 --> 01:44:21.331
What the hell are we waiting for?

1170
01:44:21.415 --> 01:44:26.044
He just made lieutenant.
Wants to hang on to his little gold bar.

1171
01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.300
Have your client in my office
in two hours.

1172
01:44:32.384 --> 01:44:34.927
And remember,
I don't have to let you go.

1173
01:44:35.012 --> 01:44:38.097
I've got you right now
for withholding evidence.

1174
01:44:39.266 --> 01:44:40.516
Loach?

1175
01:45:26.146 --> 01:45:28.022
Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

1176
01:45:29.733 --> 01:45:31.359
These her bags?

1177
01:45:33.987 --> 01:45:35.988
Is she going on a trip?

1178
01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:39.659
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

1179
01:45:39.743 --> 01:45:43.162
- Is she going on a vacation?
- Mrs. Mulwray no home.

1180
01:45:43.539 --> 01:45:47.625
"Mrs. Mulwray no home."
Well, I'll just have a look around, huh?

1181
01:45:54.758 --> 01:45:56.718
Yeah, yeah. Bad for the glass.

1182
01:45:56.802 --> 01:45:59.137
Oh, yes. Bad for glass.

1183
01:45:59.638 --> 01:46:01.973
Salt water very bad for grass.

1184
01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:19.115
Salt water?

1185
01:46:19.783 --> 01:46:22.577
Very, very bad. See?

1186
01:46:31.462 --> 01:46:32.920
- What's that?
- Huh?

1187
01:46:34.673 --> 01:46:36.132
Right there.

1188
01:46:39.970 --> 01:46:41.179
There.

1189
01:47:38.946 --> 01:47:40.822
- You wait.
- You wait.

1190
01:47:46.411 --> 01:47:48.663
How are you? I've been calling you.

1191
01:47:48.747 --> 01:47:50.206
- Yeah?
- It's all right, Kahn.

1192
01:47:50.290 --> 01:47:52.458
- Have you slept?
- Sure.

1193
01:47:53.585 --> 01:47:55.962
Have you had lunch?
Kahn can fix you something.

1194
01:47:56.046 --> 01:47:59.257
- Where's the girl?
- Upstairs. Why?

1195
01:47:59.341 --> 01:48:01.092
I want to see her.

1196
01:48:01.468 --> 01:48:05.429
She's having a bath right now.
Why do you want to see her?

1197
01:48:05.514 --> 01:48:07.181
Going someplace?

1198
01:48:08.141 --> 01:48:10.893
Yes. We have a 5:30 train to catch.

1199
01:48:14.690 --> 01:48:15.940
Jake?

1200
01:48:25.492 --> 01:48:28.077
J.J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar.

1201
01:48:28.453 --> 01:48:31.205
But... Now look, what's the matter?
What's wrong?

1202
01:48:31.290 --> 01:48:35.418
- I told you, we have a 5:30...
- You're going to miss your train.

1203
01:48:35.878 --> 01:48:37.128
Lieutenant Escobar.

1204
01:48:37.212 --> 01:48:38.337
- Lou?
- Yeah.

1205
01:48:38.422 --> 01:48:41.173
Meet me at 1972 Canyon Drive.

1206
01:48:42.926 --> 01:48:44.969
Yeah. Soon as you can.

1207
01:48:45.888 --> 01:48:47.763
Why did you do that?

1208
01:48:48.181 --> 01:48:51.058
- You know any good criminal lawyers?
- No.

1209
01:48:52.936 --> 01:48:55.730
Don't worry, I can recommend a couple.

1210
01:48:56.273 --> 01:48:59.233
They're expensive, but
you can afford it.

1211
01:49:00.027 --> 01:49:03.237
Will you please tell me
what this is all about?

1212
01:49:15.208 --> 01:49:18.210
I found these in your backyard
in the pond.

1213
01:49:19.296 --> 01:49:22.048
They belonged to your husband,
didn't they?

1214
01:49:22.132 --> 01:49:23.633
Didn't they?

1215
01:49:24.509 --> 01:49:27.803
- I don't know. Yes, probably.
- Yes, positively.

1216
01:49:27.888 --> 01:49:29.972
It's where he was drowned.

1217
01:49:30.182 --> 01:49:31.223
What?

1218
01:49:31.308 --> 01:49:33.935
There's no time
to be shocked by the truth.

1219
01:49:34.019 --> 01:49:35.519
The coroner's report proves

1220
01:49:35.604 --> 01:49:37.980
that he had salt water in his lungs
when he was killed.

1221
01:49:38.065 --> 01:49:39.440
Just take my word for it, all right?

1222
01:49:39.524 --> 01:49:41.609
Now, I want to know how it happened,
and I want to know why,

1223
01:49:41.693 --> 01:49:43.736
and I want to know
before Escobar gets here,

1224
01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:45.780
because I don't want to lose my license.

1225
01:49:45.864 --> 01:49:49.951
I don't know what you are talking about.
This is the craziest, most insane thing...

1226
01:49:50.035 --> 01:49:51.535
Stop it!

1227
01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:53.371
I'm gonna make it easy for you.

1228
01:49:53.455 --> 01:49:56.207
You were jealous. You had a fight.
He fell. He hit his head.

1229
01:49:56.291 --> 01:49:57.375
It was an accident!

1230
01:49:57.459 --> 01:50:00.127
But his girl is a witness.
So you had to shut her up.

1231
01:50:00.212 --> 01:50:01.379
You don't have the guts to harm her,

1232
01:50:01.463 --> 01:50:03.339
but you got the money
to keep her mouth shut.

1233
01:50:03.423 --> 01:50:05.049
- Yes or no?
- No!

1234
01:50:06.301 --> 01:50:08.719
Who is she? And don't give me
that crap about your sister,

1235
01:50:08.804 --> 01:50:10.888
because you don't have a sister.

1236
01:50:10.973 --> 01:50:12.640
I'll tell you...

1237
01:50:13.016 --> 01:50:15.101
I'll tell you the truth.

1238
01:50:16.979 --> 01:50:18.854
Good. What's her name?

1239
01:50:20.732 --> 01:50:23.484
- Katherine.
- Katherine who?

1240
01:50:25.946 --> 01:50:27.738
She's my daughter.

1241
01:50:28.907 --> 01:50:30.908
I said I want the truth!

1242
01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:33.160
She's my sister.

1243
01:50:34.579 --> 01:50:36.288
She's my daughter.

1244
01:50:37.290 --> 01:50:39.291
My sister, my daughter!

1245
01:50:40.127 --> 01:50:41.919
I said I want the truth!

1246
01:50:42.004 --> 01:50:43.379
All of it!

1247
01:50:45.632 --> 01:50:48.426
She's my sister and my daughter!

1248
01:50:52.347 --> 01:50:54.265
Kahn, please, go back.

1249
01:50:54.808 --> 01:50:57.184
For God's sake, keep her upstairs.
Go back!

1250
01:51:04.818 --> 01:51:06.569
My father and I...

1251
01:51:11.158 --> 01:51:12.533
Understand?

1252
01:51:13.452 --> 01:51:15.578
Or is it too tough for you?

1253
01:51:24.713 --> 01:51:26.213
He raped you?

1254
01:51:42.939 --> 01:51:44.648
Then what happened?

1255
01:51:44.941 --> 01:51:46.400
I ran away.

1256
01:51:46.735 --> 01:51:48.152
To Mexico.

1257
01:51:54.659 --> 01:51:57.995
Hollis came and took care of me.

1258
01:52:01.083 --> 01:52:02.917
I couldn't see her.

1259
01:52:04.086 --> 01:52:05.503
I was 15.

1260
01:52:09.216 --> 01:52:11.175
I wanted to, but I...

1261
01:52:12.427 --> 01:52:13.844
I couldn't.

1262
01:52:16.389 --> 01:52:17.640
Then...

1263
01:52:20.352 --> 01:52:22.520
Now I want to be with her.

1264
01:52:23.271 --> 01:52:25.439
I want to take care of her.

1265
01:52:25.774 --> 01:52:27.983
Where are you going to take her now?

1266
01:52:28.068 --> 01:52:29.693
Back to Mexico.

1267
01:52:30.987 --> 01:52:35.741
Well, you can't take the train. Escobar
will be looking for you everywhere.

1268
01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:43.040
Well, how about a plane?

1269
01:52:43.125 --> 01:52:44.333
No, that's worse.

1270
01:52:44.417 --> 01:52:47.795
You better just get out of here.
Leave all this stuff here.

1271
01:52:47.879 --> 01:52:51.757
Where does Kahn live?
Get the exact address.

1272
01:52:52.592 --> 01:52:53.968
All right.

1273
01:52:57.597 --> 01:53:00.975
Those didn't belong to Hollis.

1274
01:53:01.393 --> 01:53:03.060
How do you know?

1275
01:53:03.395 --> 01:53:05.437
He didn't wear bifocals.

1276
01:53:36.928 --> 01:53:40.681
Katherine, say hello to Mr. Gittes.

1277
01:53:40.932 --> 01:53:42.141
Hello.

1278
01:53:43.101 --> 01:53:44.268
Hello.

1279
01:53:49.274 --> 01:53:52.776
He lives at 1712 Alameda.
Do you know where that is?

1280
01:53:55.822 --> 01:53:56.989
Sure.

1281
01:54:18.011 --> 01:54:19.845
J.J. Gittes and Associates.

1282
01:54:19.971 --> 01:54:22.806
- Sophie, get me Walsh.
- Yes, Mr. Gittes.

1283
01:54:23.850 --> 01:54:25.434
- Jake?
- Yeah.

1284
01:54:25.518 --> 01:54:29.146
Listen, pal, Escobar's going to try
and book me in about five minutes.

1285
01:54:29.272 --> 01:54:30.814
What? What the hell's
the matter? What...

1286
01:54:30.899 --> 01:54:32.900
Relax and I'll tell you.

1287
01:54:32.984 --> 01:54:35.152
Wait in the office for me
about two hours.

1288
01:54:35.237 --> 01:54:39.782
If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy
meet me at 1712 Alameda.

1289
01:54:40.617 --> 01:54:43.494
Jesus. That's in Chinatown, ain't it?

1290
01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:45.579
I know where it is. Just do it.

1291
01:54:45.664 --> 01:54:47.748
1712 Alameda...

1292
01:55:16.486 --> 01:55:18.153
Come on in, Lou.

1293
01:55:19.406 --> 01:55:23.284
Looks like we're both too late.
She flew the coop.

1294
01:55:28.581 --> 01:55:31.917
I don't suppose you have any idea
where she went.

1295
01:55:32.002 --> 01:55:34.795
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Where?

1296
01:55:34.879 --> 01:55:37.756
Her maid's house.
I think she knows something's up.

1297
01:55:37.841 --> 01:55:40.009
What's the maid's address?

1298
01:55:40.468 --> 01:55:42.386
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down.

1299
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:45.472
No, no, no, Gittes.
You're going to show us.

1300
01:55:46.224 --> 01:55:47.558
What for?

1301
01:55:48.351 --> 01:55:50.477
Because if she ain't there,
you're going downtown,

1302
01:55:50.562 --> 01:55:53.772
and you're gonna stay there
until she does show up.

1303
01:55:54.399 --> 01:55:57.026
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

1304
01:55:58.403 --> 01:56:01.322
Tell us about it
on the way to San Pedro.

1305
01:56:14.502 --> 01:56:18.297
- Let's get the little lady.
- Lou, can I ask you a favor?

1306
01:56:18.798 --> 01:56:21.550
I'd like to bring her out myself.

1307
01:56:21.634 --> 01:56:25.179
She's not armed or nothing.
She won't be a problem.

1308
01:56:25.263 --> 01:56:29.183
I just want a minute alone with her.
It would mean a lot to her.

1309
01:56:29.267 --> 01:56:30.642
And to me.

1310
01:56:35.273 --> 01:56:37.649
You never learn, do you, Jake?

1311
01:56:39.319 --> 01:56:40.819
I guess not.

1312
01:56:43.782 --> 01:56:45.324
Okay. But...

1313
01:56:47.285 --> 01:56:49.328
I'll give you three minutes.

1314
01:56:49.454 --> 01:56:50.954
Just three minutes.

1315
01:56:51.039 --> 01:56:52.790
Gee, thanks, Lou.

1316
01:57:08.848 --> 01:57:10.099
Yes?

1317
01:57:11.267 --> 01:57:12.434
Hello.

1318
01:57:13.353 --> 01:57:16.814
Mr. Gittes! Come in!
Well, this is some surprise, Mr. Gittes.

1319
01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:18.774
Call me Jake. How you doing, Curly?

1320
01:57:18.858 --> 01:57:20.859
Just sitting down for supper.
You care to join us?

1321
01:57:20.985 --> 01:57:22.152
No, thanks.

1322
01:57:22.278 --> 01:57:24.029
How about a glass of wine?

1323
01:57:24.155 --> 01:57:26.782
- Hey, honey, this is the fellow that...
- I know.

1324
01:57:26.866 --> 01:57:30.202
No, thank you, Curly, very much, but I
would like a glass of water, though.

1325
01:57:30.328 --> 01:57:32.246
Come on out in the kitchen with me
for a second, huh?

1326
01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:33.747
Sure thing.

1327
01:57:37.794 --> 01:57:39.670
- Curly, where's your car?
- In the garage.

1328
01:57:39.796 --> 01:57:42.005
- Where's that?
- Off the alley.

1329
01:57:42.090 --> 01:57:44.675
- Can you give me a ride somewhere?
- Sure, soon as we eat.

1330
01:57:44.801 --> 01:57:47.177
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.

1331
01:57:47.595 --> 01:57:50.514
- I'll tell my wife.
- Tell her later, Curl, huh?

1332
01:58:22.547 --> 01:58:25.591
Just drive slow for a block or two,
will you, Curly?

1333
01:58:25.675 --> 01:58:30.095
- What's this all about?
- I'll tell you in a block or two.

1334
01:58:31.389 --> 01:58:33.140
How much do you owe me?

1335
01:58:33.224 --> 01:58:36.226
Gee, Mr. Gittes,
we're going out tomorrow.

1336
01:58:36.311 --> 01:58:40.063
I know you been real good about it,
but my cousin Auggie's sick.

1337
01:58:40.148 --> 01:58:42.024
Forget it.
How would you like to pay me off

1338
01:58:42.108 --> 01:58:45.277
by taking a couple of passengers
to Ensenada?

1339
01:58:45.361 --> 01:58:48.864
- You'd have to leave tonight.
- I don't know.

1340
01:58:48.948 --> 01:58:53.285
I might be able to squeeze 75 bucks
out of it for you.

1341
01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:55.662
Maybe even 100.

1342
01:58:57.123 --> 01:59:00.083
- Plus what I owe?
- I'll throw that in, too.

1343
01:59:01.252 --> 01:59:04.838
1712 Alameda. It's in Chinatown.
Wait for me until 8:30.

1344
01:59:04.923 --> 01:59:07.925
If I don't show up,
take them to your boat.

1345
01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:22.940
You sure this is okay?

1346
01:59:23.775 --> 01:59:27.194
Curly, you know how long
I've been in this business?

1347
01:59:54.514 --> 01:59:58.642
Have you got your checkbook handy,
Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.

1348
01:59:59.769 --> 02:00:01.937
You've got her? Where?

1349
02:00:02.021 --> 02:00:04.147
Do you remember
the figures we discussed?

1350
02:00:04.274 --> 02:00:06.400
Of course I do. Where are you?

1351
02:00:06.484 --> 02:00:09.861
At your daughter's house.
How soon can you get here?

1352
02:00:09.988 --> 02:00:11.280
An hour.

1353
02:00:35.138 --> 02:00:37.014
Oh, there you are.

1354
02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:41.518
Well, you don't look too much the worse
for wear, Mr. Gitts, I must say.

1355
02:00:42.353 --> 02:00:44.354
- Where's the girl?
- I've got her.

1356
02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:46.773
- Is she all right?
- She's fine.

1357
02:00:47.358 --> 02:00:49.192
Well, where is she?

1358
02:00:49.694 --> 02:00:51.445
With her mother.

1359
02:00:53.197 --> 02:00:56.366
I got something
I'd like to show you, Mr. Cross.

1360
02:00:56.451 --> 02:00:57.618
What is it?

1361
02:00:57.702 --> 02:01:01.371
An obituary column.
Can you see all right in this light?

1362
02:01:01.664 --> 02:01:03.206
I guess I can manage.

1363
02:01:12.967 --> 02:01:14.593
What does it mean?

1364
02:01:14.677 --> 02:01:17.054
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

1365
02:01:18.014 --> 02:01:19.431
Right here,

1366
02:01:19.724 --> 02:01:21.266
in that pond.

1367
02:01:21.934 --> 02:01:23.602
You drowned him.

1368
02:01:24.854 --> 02:01:26.647
And you left these.

1369
02:01:28.858 --> 02:01:32.986
The coroner's report shows Mulwray
had salt water in his lungs.

1370
02:01:36.532 --> 02:01:40.744
Hollis was always fascinated
by tide pools.

1371
02:01:41.746 --> 02:01:43.789
You know what he used to say?

1372
02:01:43.873 --> 02:01:45.457
I haven't the faintest idea.

1373
02:01:45.541 --> 02:01:47.626
"That's where life begins."

1374
02:01:47.710 --> 02:01:49.586
Sloughs, tide pools.

1375
02:01:51.214 --> 02:01:52.297
When we first come out here,

1376
02:01:52.382 --> 02:01:55.175
he figured if you dumped water
into desert sand

1377
02:01:55.259 --> 02:01:59.221
and let it percolate down to the
bedrock, it would stay there

1378
02:01:59.305 --> 02:02:02.391
instead of evaporate
the way it does in most reservoirs.

1379
02:02:02.475 --> 02:02:06.144
You'd only lose 20% instead of 70 or 80.
He made this city.

1380
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:08.063
And that's what you were going to do
in the Valley.

1381
02:02:08.147 --> 02:02:09.690
It's what I am doing.

1382
02:02:09.774 --> 02:02:11.525
When the bond issue passes Tuesday,

1383
02:02:11.609 --> 02:02:13.902
there'll be $8 million
to build an aqueduct and a reservoir.

1384
02:02:13.986 --> 02:02:15.445
I'm doing it.

1385
02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:17.114
Gonna be a lot of irate citizens

1386
02:02:17.198 --> 02:02:20.492
when they find out that they're paying
for water that they're not gonna get.

1387
02:02:20.618 --> 02:02:22.577
Oh, that's all taken care of.

1388
02:02:22.662 --> 02:02:26.748
See, Mr. Gitts,
either you bring the water to L.A.,

1389
02:02:26.833 --> 02:02:29.167
or you bring L.A. to the water.

1390
02:02:29.794 --> 02:02:30.919
How are you gonna do that?

1391
02:02:31.003 --> 02:02:34.840
By incorporating the Valley into the city.
Simple as that.

1392
02:02:36.551 --> 02:02:38.760
- How much are you worth?
- I have no idea.

1393
02:02:38.845 --> 02:02:39.970
How much do you want?

1394
02:02:40.054 --> 02:02:42.556
No, I just want to know
what you're worth. Over $10 million?

1395
02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:45.684
- Oh my, yes.
- Why are you doing it?

1396
02:02:45.810 --> 02:02:46.893
How much better can you eat?

1397
02:02:46.978 --> 02:02:49.229
What can you buy
that you can't already afford?

1398
02:02:49.313 --> 02:02:51.189
The future, Mr. Gitts!

1399
02:02:51.649 --> 02:02:53.066
The future!

1400
02:02:53.860 --> 02:02:55.736
Now, where's the girl?

1401
02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:58.155
I want the only daughter I've got left.

1402
02:02:58.239 --> 02:03:01.450
As you found out,
Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.

1403
02:03:01.534 --> 02:03:03.910
Who do you blame for that? Her?

1404
02:03:04.495 --> 02:03:06.329
I don't blame myself.

1405
02:03:07.582 --> 02:03:10.876
See, Mr. Gitts, most people
never have to face the fact

1406
02:03:11.002 --> 02:03:13.545
that at the right time and the right place,

1407
02:03:13.671 --> 02:03:15.839
they're capable of anything.

1408
02:03:18.009 --> 02:03:21.344
Claude, take those glasses from him,
will you?

1409
02:03:28.519 --> 02:03:30.771
It's not worth it, Mr. Gitts.

1410
02:03:32.732 --> 02:03:34.858
It's really not worth it.

1411
02:03:41.407 --> 02:03:42.449
Where's the girl?

1412
02:04:37.588 --> 02:04:40.715
You remember "Night Train"
Claude Mulvihill, don't you, boys?

1413
02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:44.344
Mr. Cross, these are my associates,
Mr. Walsh and Mr...

1414
02:04:45.596 --> 02:04:47.764
You're under arrest, Jake.

1415
02:04:49.851 --> 02:04:50.976
Good news.

1416
02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:54.729
Withholding evidence, extortion,
accessory after the fact.

1417
02:04:54.814 --> 02:04:57.148
I didn't extort nothing
from nobody, Lou.

1418
02:04:57.233 --> 02:05:00.569
This is Noah Cross, if you don't know.
Evelyn's father, if you don't know.

1419
02:05:00.653 --> 02:05:02.863
He's the bird you're after, Lou.
I can explain everything.

1420
02:05:02.947 --> 02:05:04.030
- Lieutenant?
- Just give me five minutes.

1421
02:05:04.115 --> 02:05:05.198
That's all I need.

1422
02:05:05.283 --> 02:05:07.450
- He's rich! Do you understand?
- Shut up!

1423
02:05:07.535 --> 02:05:09.703
He thinks he can get away
with anything!

1424
02:05:09.787 --> 02:05:12.038
Shut up or I'm gonna lock you in
to the wheel of that car.

1425
02:05:12.123 --> 02:05:15.876
Lieutenant, I am rich, I am Noah Cross.

1426
02:05:16.544 --> 02:05:19.004
- Evelyn Mulwray is my daughter.
- He's crazy, Lou!

1427
02:05:19.088 --> 02:05:20.797
He killed Mulwray because
of the water thing!

1428
02:05:20.882 --> 02:05:21.923
- I'm telling...
- Water?

1429
02:05:22.008 --> 02:05:23.133
Would you just listen to me
for five minutes?

1430
02:05:23.217 --> 02:05:26.011
Loach, lock him to the
wheel of that car.

1431
02:05:26.971 --> 02:05:29.848
Lou, you don't know
what's going on here. I'm telling you.

1432
02:05:29.932 --> 02:05:31.349
Katherine!

1433
02:05:31.517 --> 02:05:32.726
Katherine.

1434
02:05:32.810 --> 02:05:37.689
- I am your grandfather, my dear.
- Come, miss.

1435
02:05:37.773 --> 02:05:39.441
- I'm your grandfather.
- Come, miss.

1436
02:05:39.525 --> 02:05:41.234
Katherine, get in the car.

1437
02:05:41.319 --> 02:05:42.694
- Go on, go on.
- But, ma'am...

1438
02:05:42.778 --> 02:05:46.114
No, no, go back to the Hong Kong.
I'll follow. It's all right.

1439
02:05:46.782 --> 02:05:48.825
Get away from her. Get away!

1440
02:05:48.910 --> 02:05:53.747
Evelyn. Please, please, be reasonable.

1441
02:05:53.831 --> 02:05:56.249
- Come to my...
- Get away from her!

1442
02:05:56.334 --> 02:05:57.626
Evelyn!

1443
02:05:58.836 --> 02:06:01.713
How many years have I got?

1444
02:06:02.298 --> 02:06:03.882
She's mine, too.

1445
02:06:03.966 --> 02:06:06.384
She's never going to know that!

1446
02:06:08.554 --> 02:06:12.807
Evelyn, you're a disturbed woman.
You cannot hope to provide.

1447
02:06:12.892 --> 02:06:15.685
Evelyn, put that gun away!
Let the police handle this!

1448
02:06:15.770 --> 02:06:17.604
He owns the police!

1449
02:06:18.397 --> 02:06:19.981
Get away from her.

1450
02:06:20.066 --> 02:06:23.276
- You'll have to kill me first.
- Get away! Get...

1451
02:06:24.445 --> 02:06:26.571
Katherine, close the door.

1452
02:06:27.406 --> 02:06:28.573
Halt!

1453
02:07:09.073 --> 02:07:10.532
Oh, no!

1454
02:07:10.616 --> 02:07:13.326
Better call the captain.
Get an ambulance.

1455
02:07:13.411 --> 02:07:15.412
- No!
- Turn him loose. Turn them all loose.

1456
02:07:15.496 --> 02:07:17.080
- Lord.
- No!

1457
02:07:20.668 --> 02:07:21.960
Lord.

1458
02:07:22.378 --> 02:07:23.753
Lord.

1459
02:07:25.339 --> 02:07:26.840
No! No!

1460
02:07:28.634 --> 02:07:32.387
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Don't look. Don't look. Don't look.

1461
02:07:44.984 --> 02:07:47.652
- As little as possible.
- What's that?

1462
02:07:50.906 --> 02:07:52.407
What's that?

1463
02:07:56.912 --> 02:07:59.831
You want to do your partner
a big favor?

1464
02:08:01.459 --> 02:08:03.001
Take him home.

1465
02:08:06.589 --> 02:08:08.173
Take him home!

1466
02:08:08.424 --> 02:08:10.967
Just get him the hell out of here!

1467
02:08:11.052 --> 02:08:12.594
Come on, Jake.

1468
02:08:13.637 --> 02:08:15.180
Go home, Jake.

1469
02:08:16.182 --> 02:08:18.224
I'm doing you a favor.

1470
02:08:19.769 --> 02:08:21.352
Come on, Jake.

1471
02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:26.816
Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.

1472
02:08:41.665 --> 02:08:45.585
All right, come on. Clear the area!
On the sidewalk!

1473
02:08:47.588 --> 02:08:49.255
On the sidewalk!

1474
02:08:51.425 --> 02:08:53.176
Get off the street!

1475
02:08:55.513 --> 02:08:57.305
Get off the street!
