So the guy says, "Why don't you do
what the Chinese do?"

174
00:17:43.981 --> 00:17:45.607
He says, "What do the Chinese do?"

175
00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:47.818
He says, "The Chinese they screw
a little and they get tired..."

176
00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:51.321
Duffy. Hey, Walsh!

177
00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:55.075
Sophie, go to the little girls' room
for a minute, okay?

178
00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.869
- But, Mr. Gittes...
- Sophie...

179
00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:00.539
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

180
00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:01.707
- Jake...
- Duffy, listen to me, man.

181
00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:03.083
I want to tell you a story.

182
00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:05.294
So, there's this guy, Walsh,
you understand?

183
00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:07.170
He's tired of screwing his wife.

184
00:18:07.254 --> 00:18:08.839
- Jake, there's a problem...
- Wait a second, Duffy.

185
00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.507
You're always in such a hurry.

186
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:12.259
So his friend says to him,

187
00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.511
"Hey, why don't you
do it like the Chinese do?"

188
00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:16.555
So he says,
"Well, how do the Chinese do it?"

189
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.308
The guy says, "Well, the Chinese,
first they screw a little bit,

190
00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:22.060
"then they stop and they go
and read a little Confucius.

191
00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:25.022
"Come back, screw a little bit more,
then they stop again,

192
00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:26.982
- "go back and they screw a little..."
- Jake.

193
00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:29.401
Walsh, just listen to me for a second.

194
00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:30.944
I mean, you'll love this.

195
00:18:31.028 --> 00:18:34.197
Now, then they go back
and they screw a little bit more,

196
00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:36.241
and then they go out
and they contemplate the moon

197
00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:39.286
or something like that.
Makes it more exciting.

198
00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:43.290
So, now, the guy goes home and
he starts screwing his own wife, see.

199
00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.667
So, he screws her for a little bit,
and then he stops.

200
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:48.503
He goes out of the room
and reads <i>LIFE</i> magazine.

201
00:18:48.587 --> 00:18:50.672
Then he goes back in,
he starts screwing again,

202
00:18:50.756 --> 00:18:52.257
and he says,
"Excuse me for a minute, honey"

203
00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.051
and he goes out
and he smokes a cigarette.

204
00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.511
Now, his wife is getting sore as hell.

205
00:18:56.595 --> 00:18:58.555
He comes back in the room,
he starts screwing again,

206
00:18:58.639 --> 00:19:00.641
he gets up to start to leave again
to go look at the moon,

207
00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:02.559
she looks at him and says,
"Hey, what's the matter with you?

208
00:19:02.643 --> 00:19:05.479
"You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"

209
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.398
Jesus!

210
00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:10.233
That Barney!

211
00:19:15.614 --> 00:19:16.948
Mr. Gittes?

212
00:19:18.784 --> 00:19:19.951
Yes.

213
00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.329
Do you know me?

214
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.581
Well,

215
00:19:26.083 --> 00:19:28.460
I think I would have remembered.

216
00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:30.504
Have we ever met?

217
00:19:32.923 --> 00:19:34.424
Well, no.

218
00:19:34.508 --> 00:19:35.842
Never?

219
00:19:35.926 --> 00:19:37.177
Never.

220
00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:39.012
That's what I thought.

221
00:19:39.096 --> 00:19:41.181
You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

222
00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:43.600
You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife?

223
00:19:45.102 --> 00:19:48.313
Not that Mulwray?

224
00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:51.024
Yes, Mr. Gittes, that Mulwray.

225
00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:55.404
And since you agree with me
that we've never met before,

226
00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:58.782
you must also agree with me
that I never hired you to do anything,

227
00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:01.326
certainly not spy on my husband.

228
00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:04.162
I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.

229
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.624
Well, you're going to get it.

230
00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:09.835
Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray.

231
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.003
I think there's been some
misunderstanding here.

232
00:20:12.129 --> 00:20:13.714
There's no point
in getting tough with me. I'm just...

233
00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:16.842
I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Gittes.

234
00:20:16.967 --> 00:20:18.635
My lawyer does.

235
00:20:20.137 --> 00:20:22.848
Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.

236
00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:29.396
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

237
00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:47.164
- Mr. Mulwray?
- He's not in, Mr...

238
00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.958
- Gittes.
- May I ask what this is regarding?

239
00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.377
It's a personal matter.
Has he been gone long?

240
00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.004
Since lunch.

241
00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:57.632
- Gee whiz, and I'm late.
- He was expecting you?

242
00:20:57.716 --> 00:21:01.261
Fifteen minutes ago.
Why don't I just go in and wait?

243
00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:03.722
Sir?

244
00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.519
RECEPTIONIST: Is Mr. Yelburton there?

245
00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:12.689
Is he still in the building?

246
00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:15.233
Very well. Thank you.

247
00:22:37.274 --> 00:22:40.986
Can I help you? Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

248
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:42.612
J.J. Gittes.

249
00:22:42.696 --> 00:22:45.323
It's not a departmental matter,
Mr. Yelburton.

250
00:22:45.448 --> 00:22:47.659
I wonder if you'd care
to wait in my office.

251
00:22:47.784 --> 00:22:48.869
Certainly.

252
00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:52.038
We're a bit nervous around here

253
00:22:52.122 --> 00:22:55.041
with all this business in the papers
about Mr. Mulwray.

254
00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.835
Right this way.

255
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:05.886
You know, after you've worked
with a man for a certain length of time,

256
00:23:05.969 --> 00:23:07.095
(DOOR CLOSING)

257
00:23:07.178 --> 00:23:09.764
you come to know his habits, his values.

258
00:23:09.848 --> 00:23:10.932
You come to know him.

259
00:23:11.016 --> 00:23:14.227
And either he's the kind
who chases after women or he isn't.

260
00:23:14.311 --> 00:23:15.687
And Mulwray isn't?

261
00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:18.064
He never even kids about it.

262
00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:21.234
Well, maybe he takes it very seriously.

263
00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:26.364
- Sit down.
- No, thank you.

264
00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:28.658
Do you know
where Mulwray's having lunch?

265
00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:30.827
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

266
00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:33.747
Well, tell him I'll be back.

267
00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:36.082
I will.

268
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.418
Do you mind if I take one of your cards?

269
00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:40.378
In case I have
to get in touch with you again.

270
00:23:40.503 --> 00:23:42.839
- No, help yourself.
- Thank you.

271
00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:49.679
Mulvihill! What are you doing here?

272
00:23:49.763 --> 00:23:52.098
They shut my water off.
What's it to you?

273
00:23:52.182 --> 00:23:55.477
How'd you find out about it?
You don't drink it.

274
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.104
You don't take a bath in it.

275
00:23:58.188 --> 00:23:59.898
They wrote you a letter!

276
00:24:00.023 --> 00:24:02.943
But then you'd have to be able to read.

277
00:24:04.569 --> 00:24:08.365
Relax, Mulvihill. Glad to see you.
You know Claude Mulvihill here?

278
00:24:08.448 --> 00:24:11.076
Well, I hope so. He's working for us.

279
00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:12.285
Doing what?

280
00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:13.870
Well, frankly, there have been
some threats

281
00:24:13.954 --> 00:24:15.747
to blow up the city reservoirs.

282
00:24:15.872 --> 00:24:18.416
- Any particular reason?
- Well, it's this darn drought.

283
00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:21.169
We've had to ration water in the Valley
and the farmers are desperate.

284
00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:23.755
But what can we do? The rest of the city
needs drinking water.

285
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.508
- Well, you're in luck, Mr. Yelburton.
- How's that?

286
00:24:26.591 --> 00:24:29.177
When Mulvihill here
was Sheriff of Ventura County,

287
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.639
the rum runners landed hundreds
of tons of booze on the beach

288
00:24:32.722 --> 00:24:35.225
and never lost a drop.

289
00:24:35.308 --> 00:24:38.645
He ought to be able
to hold on to your water for you.

290
00:25:14.764 --> 00:25:17.100
(WIPING)

291
00:25:38.705 --> 00:25:41.291
J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

292
00:25:52.469 --> 00:25:54.971
(WIPING)

293
00:26:05.148 --> 00:26:06.483
Please.

294
00:26:22.332 --> 00:26:23.666
You wait.

295
00:26:42.685 --> 00:26:44.771
(GROANING)

296
00:27:13.466 --> 00:27:15.135
(GROANING)

297
00:27:25.228 --> 00:27:28.398
- Bad for glass.
- Yeah. Sure.

298
00:27:29.482 --> 00:27:31.734
Bad for the glass.

299
00:28:08.313 --> 00:28:09.397
Mr. Gittes.

300
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.984
Actually, I came to see
your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.

301
00:28:15.612 --> 00:28:17.405
Would you like something to drink?

302
00:28:17.488 --> 00:28:18.698
What are you having?

303
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:21.576
- Iced tea.
- That'll be fine, thank you.

304
00:28:21.659 --> 00:28:24.871
- Two iced teas, Kahn, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

305
00:28:25.997 --> 00:28:28.166
My husband's at the office.

306
00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:32.086
Actually, he's not, Mrs. Mulwray,

307
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.714
and he's checked out of his apartment
at the El Macondo.

308
00:28:34.797 --> 00:28:37.634
That's not his apartment.

309
00:28:37.967 --> 00:28:39.052
(CLEARING THROAT)

310
00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:40.511
Anyway, I...

311
00:28:42.013 --> 00:28:45.308
The point is, is I'm not in business
to be loved, but I am in business,

312
00:28:45.391 --> 00:28:47.810
and believe me, Mrs. Mulwray,
whoever set your husband up,

313
00:28:47.894 --> 00:28:49.020
set me up.

314
00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:51.356
L.A.'s a small town. People talk.

315
00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:54.943
I'm just trying to make a living.
I don't want to become a local joke.

316
00:28:55.026 --> 00:28:58.529
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it.
I'll drop the lawsuit.

317
00:28:58.655 --> 00:29:00.782
- What?
- I said, I'll drop the lawsuit.

318
00:29:00.865 --> 00:29:02.992
So let's just drop the whole thing.

319
00:29:03.076 --> 00:29:04.827
- Sugar, lemon, or both?
- Both.

320
00:29:04.911 --> 00:29:06.746
- Mrs. Mulwray...
- Yes, Mr. Gittes?

321
00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:08.998
...I don't want to drop it.

322
00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:13.336
I better talk to your husband about this.

323
00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:15.922
Why? What on Earth for?

324
00:29:16.005 --> 00:29:18.132
Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

325
00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:19.342
(CHUCKLING)

326
00:29:19.425 --> 00:29:21.970
Well, I've been accused
of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray,

327
00:29:22.053 --> 00:29:23.179
but never that.

328
00:29:23.263 --> 00:29:25.223
Look, somebody's gone
to a lot of trouble here,

329
00:29:25.348 --> 00:29:27.642
and lawsuit or no lawsuit,
I intend to find out.

330
00:29:27.725 --> 00:29:31.020
I'm not supposed to be the one
who's caught with his pants down.

331
00:29:31.104 --> 00:29:33.564
So unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk to your husband.

332
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:35.608
Why should it be a problem?

333
00:29:35.692 --> 00:29:39.946
- May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
- You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

334
00:29:41.114 --> 00:29:43.324
Well, that little girlfriend,
she was pretty,

335
00:29:43.408 --> 00:29:45.702
in a cheap sort of a way, of course.

336
00:29:45.785 --> 00:29:49.122
She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together.

337
00:29:49.205 --> 00:29:52.208
Suppose they did.
How does that affect you?

338
00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:55.420
- It's nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray.
- It's very personal!

339
00:29:55.545 --> 00:29:57.880
It couldn't be more personal.

340
00:29:58.715 --> 00:30:01.551
Is this business
or an obsession with you?

341
00:30:01.634 --> 00:30:03.594
Let's look at it this way.

342
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.307
Now, this phony broad,
excuse the language,

343
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.892
she tells me she's you. She hires me.

344
00:30:09.976 --> 00:30:12.186
Now, whoever put her up to it
doesn't have anything against me.

345
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.438
They're out to get your husband.

346
00:30:13.563 --> 00:30:16.065
If I can see him, I can help him.

347
00:30:19.152 --> 00:30:21.738
Did you talk to him this morning?

348
00:30:22.405 --> 00:30:23.448
No.

349
00:30:24.115 --> 00:30:25.908
I went riding rather early.

350
00:30:26.659 --> 00:30:28.536
Looks like you went quite a distance.

351
00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:30.580
I was riding bareback.

352
00:30:32.165 --> 00:30:33.416
You...

353
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.753
You might try the Oak Pass
or the Stone Canyon Reservoir.

354
00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:38.671
Frequently, at lunch,
Hollis takes walks around them.

355
00:30:38.755 --> 00:30:40.298
Otherwise, he'll be home by 6:30.

356
00:30:40.423 --> 00:30:42.091
I'll stop by.

357
00:30:42.175 --> 00:30:43.968
Please call first.

358
00:31:00.443 --> 00:31:02.612
Sorry, closed to public, sir.

359
00:31:03.196 --> 00:31:05.615
Oh, that's all right, Officer.

360
00:31:06.991 --> 00:31:10.119
Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

361
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.790
- Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.
- That's okay.

362
00:31:39.565 --> 00:31:41.818
- Gittes! For Christ's sake!
- Loach.

363
00:31:41.901 --> 00:31:44.112
- Get out of here before he sees you.
- What are you talking about?

364
00:31:44.195 --> 00:31:46.531
- What's going on here?
- Loach!

365
00:31:48.157 --> 00:31:49.659
Hello, Jake.

366
00:31:50.493 --> 00:31:52.328
Lou. How are you?

367
00:31:53.496 --> 00:31:58.167
Lousy cold I can't seem to shake,
but otherwise, I'm okay.

368
00:31:58.251 --> 00:32:02.422
- Yeah, summer colds are the worst.
- Yeah, they are.

369
00:32:02.505 --> 00:32:03.965
There's no smoking here, sir...

370
00:32:04.048 --> 00:32:06.926
That's all right, Officer.
We can make an exception this time.

371
00:32:07.009 --> 00:32:10.304
I'll see he's careful with the matches
and doesn't burn himself.

372
00:32:10.388 --> 00:32:12.056
Thanks, Lou.

373
00:32:12.181 --> 00:32:14.517
How'd you get past the guard?

374
00:32:15.268 --> 00:32:18.062
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.

375
00:32:19.188 --> 00:32:22.150
You look like
you've done well by yourself.

376
00:32:22.233 --> 00:32:23.276
I get by.

377
00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:26.779
Well, sometimes it takes a while
for a man to find himself.

378
00:32:26.863 --> 00:32:28.072
Maybe you have.

379
00:32:28.197 --> 00:32:31.242
Yeah, going through
other people's dirty linen.

380
00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:35.204
Yeah. Tell me,
you still putting Chinamen in jail

381
00:32:35.288 --> 00:32:37.582
for spitting in the laundry?

382
00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:40.585
You're a little behind the times, Jake.

383
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.753
They use steam irons now.

384
00:32:42.962 --> 00:32:45.047
And I'm out of Chinatown.

385
00:32:45.715 --> 00:32:47.133
Since when?

386
00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.719
Since I made lieutenant.

387
00:32:50.636 --> 00:32:52.054
Congratulations.

388
00:32:52.138 --> 00:32:53.264
Hmm.

389
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:56.976
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm looking for somebody.

390
00:32:57.059 --> 00:32:58.227
Who?

391
00:32:58.769 --> 00:33:01.105
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

392
00:33:01.647 --> 00:33:02.899
Yeah.

393
00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:05.485
I'd like to talk to him.

394
00:33:06.068 --> 00:33:08.404
So you'd like to talk to him, huh?

395
00:33:09.906 --> 00:33:11.824
You're welcome to try.

396
00:33:13.159 --> 00:33:14.660
There he is.

397
00:33:32.637 --> 00:33:36.432
Looks like he was washed down
the entire length of the run-off channel.

398
00:33:37.266 --> 00:33:39.769
- Could he swim?
- Of course.

399
00:33:41.103 --> 00:33:44.649
Obviously, the fall
must have knocked him unconscious.

400
00:33:46.442 --> 00:33:47.944
Mrs. Mulwray,

401
00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:52.281
this alleged affair
your husband was having.

402
00:33:53.282 --> 00:33:55.826
The publicity didn't make him

403
00:33:56.953 --> 00:33:58.788
morose, or unhappy?

404
00:34:00.164 --> 00:34:02.250
It didn't make him happy.

405
00:34:02.333 --> 00:34:05.169
There is no possibility
that he would have taken his own life?

406
00:34:05.294 --> 00:34:06.462
No.

407
00:34:08.464 --> 00:34:10.132
Mrs. Mulwray,

408
00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:14.220
do you happen to know the name
of the young lady in question?

409
00:34:15.555 --> 00:34:16.681
No.

410
00:34:17.014 --> 00:34:19.100
- Or where she might be?
- Certainly not.

411
00:34:19.183 --> 00:34:22.061
You and your husband
never discussed her?

412
00:34:23.813 --> 00:34:24.981
He...

413
00:34:25.982 --> 00:34:27.191
(STUTTERING) We did.

414
00:34:27.817 --> 00:34:30.152
He wouldn't tell me her name.

415
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:34.865
We quarreled over her, of course.
It came as a complete surprise to me.

416
00:34:34.991 --> 00:34:36.951
A complete surprise?

417
00:34:37.034 --> 00:34:39.579
I thought you hired
a private investigator.

418
00:34:40.329 --> 00:34:42.832
A private investigator?

419
00:34:43.708 --> 00:34:45.209
Mr. Gittes.

(HESITATING)

421
00:34:51.048 --> 00:34:54.510
Yes, but I did that
because I thought I would put an end

422
00:34:54.594 --> 00:34:57.430
to a ridiculous rumor
that had no basis.

423
00:34:58.055 --> 00:35:00.224
Uh-huh.

424
00:35:00.766 --> 00:35:02.143
When did Mr. Gittes inform you

425
00:35:02.226 --> 00:35:04.812
that these rumors
had some foundation in fact?

426
00:35:04.895 --> 00:35:08.107
Just before the story
broke in the papers, Lou.

427
00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:11.569
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could find her?

428
00:35:11.694 --> 00:35:12.778
No.

429
00:35:13.362 --> 00:35:15.573
- Or her name?
- No.

430
00:35:16.574 --> 00:35:17.658
Of course not.

431
00:35:17.742 --> 00:35:19.952
Will you need me
for anything else, Lieutenant?

432
00:35:20.036 --> 00:35:22.246
Oh, no, no, Mrs. Mulwray,
I don't think so.

433
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:25.791
If we need any more information,
we'll be in touch.

434
00:35:26.417 --> 00:35:29.211
Of course you have
my deepest sympathy.

435
00:35:30.546 --> 00:35:33.424
I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.

436
00:35:36.218 --> 00:35:39.513
- Jake, come on, what's the story?
- Take it easy, guys. Let us get through.

437

going along with me back there.

443
00:35:55.404 --> 00:35:58.240
I just didn't want to explain anything.

444
00:35:58.783 --> 00:36:00.576
I'll send you a check.

445
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.744

Nothing, Morty. It's my lunch hour.

- Yeah.

Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.

463
00:37:13.149 --> 00:37:14.984
Quite a character.

464
00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:19.029
Lately he'd been living
in one of the downtown storm drains.

465
00:37:20.489 --> 00:37:23.701
Had a bureau dresser down there
and everything.

466
00:37:24.535 --> 00:37:25.870
All right, there.

467
00:37:32.418 --> 00:37:34.462
Yeah. He drowned, too.

468
00:37:35.629 --> 00:37:36.881
Come again?

469
00:37:36.964 --> 00:37:40.593
Yeah. Got drunk, passed out
in the bottom of the riverbed.

Well, it's dry as a bone, Morty.

It's not completely dry.

474
00:37:50.811 --> 00:37:53.606
Well, he ain't gonna exactly
drown in a damp riverbed,

475

- When it comes.

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:08.640
Then he found out
you were dumping water at night.

690
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:10.892
Then he was...

691
00:55:11.226 --> 00:55:12.560
Drowned.

692
00:55:13.394 --> 00:55:16.314
Mr. Gittes,
that's an outrageous accusation.

693
00:55:16.397 --> 00:55:18.733
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:55:30.078 --> 00:55:31.746
Mr. Gittes,

698
00:55:32.705 --> 00:55:34.040
we're...

699
00:55:35.542 --> 00:55:38.670
We're not anxious for this to get around,
but we have been diverting a little water

700
00:55:38.753 --> 00:55:41.756
to irrigate orange groves
in the Northwest Valley.

701
00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:44.509
As you know, the farmers out there
have no legal right to our water,

702
00:55:44.592 --> 00:55:46.261
but we've been trying to help
some of them out,

703
00:55:46.344 --> 00:55:48.263
keep them from going under.

704
00:55:48.388 --> 00:55:52.100
Naturally, when you divert water,
there's a little run-off.

705
00:55:52.225 --> 00:55:54.352
Yeah. A little run-off.

706
00:55:55.103 --> 00:55:58.857
- Where'd you say those groves were?
- In the Northwest Valley.

707
00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.734
That's like saying they're in Arizona.

708
00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:06.614
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out.
I can't give you the exact location.

709
00:56:07.115 --> 00:56:09.784
- You're a married man, aren't you?
- Yes.

710
00:56:09.909 --> 00:56:12.912
Hard-working? Wife? Kids?

711
00:56:13.705 --> 00:56:14.956
Yes.

I don't want to nail you.

713
00:56:22.046 --> 00:56:24.799
I want to find out who put you up to it.

714
00:56:24.924 --> 00:56:27.218
I'll give you a few days to think about it.

715
00:56:27.302 --> 00:56:29.137
Call me. I can help.

716

Who knows?

717
00:56:31.055 --> 00:56:34.642
Maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big-shots,

718
00:56:34.726 --> 00:56:36.311
and you can stay

Yes, of course.

741

00:58:34.762 --> 00:58:38.099
I was just out of grade school
when they did that.

743

Then you married
your father's business partner.

744
00:58:45.773 --> 00:58:48.776
You've already got one going,
Mrs. Mulwray.

upset you?

Over you
or over the Water Department?

753

Not over me. Why should it be over me?

754
00:59:13.051 --> 00:59:14.719
Then it was over
the Water Department.

755
00:59:14.802 --> 00:59:15.803
Yes.

756
00:59:17.055 --> 00:59:19.474
Hollis felt that the water
should belong to the public,

757
00:59:19.599 --> 00:59:23.394
and I don't think my father felt that way.

758
00:59:23.978 --> 00:59:26.647
Actually, it was over
the Van der Lip Dam.

759
00:59:26.773 --> 00:59:28.066
You know, the dam that broke?

760
00:59:28.149 --> 00:59:31.569
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes. Hollis never forgave him for it.

761
00:59:31.652 --> 00:59:35.907
- Never forgave him for what?
- For talking him into building it.

with another husband.

No. She happens to think
the last one was murdered.

781
01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:35.610
How'd she get that idea?

782
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:38.279
I think I gave it to her.

783
01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:43.284
I hope you don't mind. I believe
they should be served with the head.

Of course, he has to swim
in the same water we all do.

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:25.368
Of course, but you've no reason to think
he's bungled the case?

- None.
- That's too bad.

- Too bad?
- Hmm.

and too respectable
to want your name in the newspapers.

821
01:03:47.575 --> 01:03:50.244
Of course I'm respectable. I'm old.

or what Evelyn might do to her?

862
01:06:11.177 --> 01:06:13.012
Just find the girl.

863
01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:16.223
I'll look into it,

864
01:06:16.348 --> 01:06:19.518
as soon as I've checked out
some orange groves.

865
01:06:20.436 --> 01:06:22.021
Orange groves?

866
01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:25.357
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.

867
01:06:30.571 --> 01:06:32.573
I'm a little lost.
I wonder if you could tell me

868
01:06:32.698 --> 01:06:35.409
where the plat books
for the Northwest Valley are?

869
01:06:35.534 --> 01:06:37.328
Part of it's in Ventura County.

870
01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:40.915
We don't have Ventura County
in our Hall of Records.

871
01:06:41.373 --> 01:06:44.585
Well, then, I'll settle
for Los Angeles County.

872
01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:47.129
Row 23, section C.

873
01:06:51.592 --> 01:06:52.885
Weasel.

874
01:07:48.315 --> 01:07:49.775
Say, sonny,

875
01:07:51.986 --> 01:07:55.614
why do they have all those names
pasted in the plat books?

876
01:07:55.698 --> 01:07:59.201
Land sales out of escrow
are always recorded within the week.

877
01:07:59.326 --> 01:08:02.496
- Then these are all new owners?
- That's right.

878
01:08:03.664 --> 01:08:07.126
Well, that means that most of the Valley
sold in the last few months.

879
01:08:07.209 --> 01:08:09.211
If that's what it says.

880
01:08:10.838 --> 01:08:13.507
Can I check one of these volumes out?

881
01:08:14.466 --> 01:08:18.512
Sir, this is not a lending library.
It's the Hall of Records.

882
01:08:18.637 --> 01:08:21.557
- How about a ruler?
- A ruler?

883
01:08:22.558 --> 01:08:25.811
Yeah. The print's real fine.
I left my glasses home.

884
01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:28.522
I'd like to be able to read across.

885
01:08:40.409 --> 01:08:42.036
Why, thank you.

886
01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:53.672
(COUGHING LOUDLY)

887
01:09:49.228 --> 01:09:50.979
MAN: Hold it right there!

888
01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:01.842
All right, quit it. Quit, now!

889
01:11:01.967 --> 01:11:04.511
Search the man. See if he's armed.

890
01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:20.736
I said see if he's armed,
not empty his pockets!

891
01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:23.113
Search him. Search him!

892
01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:26.074
He ain't armed.

893
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.659
All right, mister, who you with,

894
01:11:27.743 --> 01:11:30.913
the Water Department
or the Real Estate Office?

895
01:11:31.705 --> 01:11:33.248
- Get away from me!
- Answer him!

896
01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:34.750
You come near me
with that thing again,

897
01:11:34.875 --> 01:11:35.918
you're gonna need a pair of them!

898
01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:37.836
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

899
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.882
OLD MAN: I said cut that out! Give
the man a chance to say something!

900
01:11:45.552 --> 01:11:49.223
The name's Gittes.
I'm a private investigator.

901
01:11:49.306 --> 01:11:51.058
I'm not with either one of them.

902
01:11:52.226 --> 01:11:54.603
Then what you doing out here, mister?

903
01:11:54.895 --> 01:11:56.939
A client hired me to see...

904
01:11:57.981 --> 01:12:00.776
To see if the Water Department
was irrigating your land.

905
01:12:00.901 --> 01:12:02.569
Irrigating my land?

906
01:12:02.653 --> 01:12:04.279
The Water Department's been sending
you people out here

907
01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:07.115
to blow up my water tanks,
they put poison down three of my wells.

908
01:12:07.241 --> 01:12:09.326
I call that a funny way to irrigate.

909
01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:12.162
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?

910
01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:18.669
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

911
01:12:18.752 --> 01:12:21.755
Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch
who's done it to us.

912
01:12:21.839 --> 01:12:26.426
Mulwray's dead. You don't know what
you're talking about, you dumb Okie.

913
01:12:33.809 --> 01:12:35.936
MAN: Well, that's that.

914
01:13:03.005 --> 01:13:04.673
What's going on?

915
01:13:05.132 --> 01:13:06.758
You didn't look too good,

916
01:13:06.842 --> 01:13:09.845
so we thought we better call
your employer.

917
01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:16.143
Thanks for coming.

918
01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:23.400
- That dam's a con job.
- What dam?

919
01:13:23.483 --> 01:13:27.237
The one your husband opposed.
They're conning L.A. into building it.

920
01:13:27.321 --> 01:13:30.073
But the water's not gonna go to L.A.,
it's coming right here.

921
01:13:30.157 --> 01:13:31.366
To the Valley?

922
01:13:31.491 --> 01:13:33.911
Everything you can see.
Everything around us.

923
01:13:33.994 --> 01:13:36.538
I was at the Hall of Records today.

924
01:13:42.711 --> 01:13:46.506
In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres,

925
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:50.302
Emma Dill, 12,000,
Clarence Speer, 5,000,

926
01:13:50.385 --> 01:13:53.597
and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres.

927
01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.682
- Jasper Lamar Crabb?
- You know him?

928
01:13:55.766 --> 01:13:59.519
- I think I would've remembered.
- Yeah.

929
01:13:59.603 --> 01:14:01.438
They're blowing these farmers
out of their land

930
01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:02.981
and then picking it up for peanuts.

931
01:14:03.065 --> 01:14:07.653
You have any idea what this land would
be worth with a steady water supply?

932
01:14:07.736 --> 01:14:10.739
About $30 million more
than they paid for it.

933
01:14:12.532 --> 01:14:15.911
- Hollis knew about this?
- That's why he was killed.

934
01:14:17.871 --> 01:14:19.706
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

935
01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.542
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

936
01:14:25.045 --> 01:14:26.755
- We got it!
- What?

937
01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.423
- We got it.
- What? What is it?

938
01:14:28.548 --> 01:14:31.551
"A memorial service was held
at the Mar Vista Inn today

939
01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:32.761
"for Jasper Lamar Crabb."

940
01:14:32.886 --> 01:14:35.263
He passed away two weeks ago.

941
01:14:36.223 --> 01:14:37.933
Why is that unusual?

942
01:14:38.392 --> 01:14:42.104
He passed away two weeks ago,
and one week ago he bought the land.

943
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:43.814
That's unusual.

944
01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:30.986
Hello, there. I'm Mr. Palmer.
Can I help you folks?

945
01:15:31.445 --> 01:15:33.280
Yes, I hope so.

946
01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:35.949
It's Dad.

947
01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:38.076
I can't seem to handle him anymore.

948
01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.495
- Can I, sweetheart?
- My goodness.

949
01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.123
Nothing with Dad. It's me.

950
01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:45.792
Oh, no, no, Dad is an absolute angel
with everyone else.

951
01:15:45.876 --> 01:15:48.962
- It's just that he and my...
- Oh, I don't know.

952
01:15:49.046 --> 01:15:51.923
Of course, I'm anxious
for him to have the best,

953
01:15:52.007 --> 01:15:53.800
and money is no object.

954
01:15:53.884 --> 01:15:56.636
Perhaps if we met with your father.

955
01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.973
- There is one question.
- Of course.

956
01:16:00.057 --> 01:16:03.226
Do you accept people
of the Jewish persuasion?

957
01:16:03.977 --> 01:16:05.854
I'm sorry, but we don't.

958
01:16:05.979 --> 01:16:07.606
Don't be sorry. Neither does Dad.

959
01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:10.650
We just wanted to be sure,
didn't we, hon?

960
01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:15.072
Would it be possible for me to see
a list of your patients, just to be certain?

961
01:16:15.155 --> 01:16:19.284
We never reveal the names
of our guests as a matter of policy.

962
01:16:19.367 --> 01:16:21.495
You would appreciate that
if your father came to live with us.

963
01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:24.831
That's exactly
what I wanted to hear you say.

964
01:16:24.915 --> 01:16:26.041
Good.

965
01:16:26.166 --> 01:16:28.502
I wonder, is it too late
for us to have a look around?

966
01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:29.878
No. Allow me to show you.

967
01:16:30.003 --> 01:16:32.589
Would you mind
if we took a stroll on our own?

968
01:16:32.672 --> 01:16:35.092
Just if you'll confine yourself
to the main building.

969
01:16:35.175 --> 01:16:36.927
It's almost bedtime.

970
01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:40.263
We understand. Come, my sweet.

971
01:16:40.847 --> 01:16:43.183
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON PIANO)

972
01:16:52.692 --> 01:16:55.278
Charlie! You ought to know
better than that!

973
01:16:55.362 --> 01:16:57.364
Sit down. Have a chair.

974
01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:20.220
They're all there. Every goddamn name.

975
01:17:26.268 --> 01:17:29.813
You're looking at the owners
of a 50,000-acre empire.

976
01:17:29.896 --> 01:17:31.439
They can't be.

977
01:17:35.944 --> 01:17:38.572
They may not know it, but they are.

978
01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.950
- Hello, girls.
- ALL: Hello.

979
01:17:42.075 --> 01:17:44.578
- Hello.
- Are any of you Emma Dill?

980
01:17:46.246 --> 01:17:48.874
- Yes? Are you Emma?
- Yes.

981
01:17:48.957 --> 01:17:51.543
Well, I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.

982
01:17:51.626 --> 01:17:52.669
Why?

983
01:17:52.752 --> 01:17:54.963
Did you know you were
a very wealthy woman?

984
01:17:55.088 --> 01:17:56.882
Oh, I'm not.

985
01:17:56.965 --> 01:18:01.094
- Yes, you are. You own a lot of land.
- No more.

986
01:18:01.845 --> 01:18:03.096
Some time ago,

987
01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:07.225
my late husband owned a good deal
of beach property at Long Beach,

988
01:18:07.309 --> 01:18:08.935
but we lost it.

989
01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:11.938
- That's very beautiful.
- Thanks.

990
01:18:12.606 --> 01:18:14.608
Where did you get
this piece of material?

991
01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:16.610
At the Abbacore Club.

992
01:18:16.943 --> 01:18:20.530
- Abbacore?
- No. The Albacore.

993
01:18:20.614 --> 01:18:22.574
It's a fish.

994
01:18:22.657 --> 01:18:27.370
My grandson is a member,
and they take very nice care of us.

995
01:18:27.454 --> 01:18:29.372
How do they do that?

996
01:18:29.456 --> 01:18:33.627
Oh, give us things,
not just like this old flag, but...

997
01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:35.170
But what?

998
01:18:35.295 --> 01:18:38.632
We're a sort of unofficial charity
of theirs, Mr. Gittes.

999
01:18:39.716 --> 01:18:43.845
Would you come with me, please?
Someone wants to talk with you.

1000
01:18:46.556 --> 01:18:47.599
Goodbye, ladies.

1001
01:18:47.682 --> 01:18:48.725
- Bye!
- Bye!

1002
01:18:56.983 --> 01:18:59.986
Come on.
I want you to meet someone, Gittes.

1003
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:02.280
Can we leave the lady out of this?

1004
01:19:02.364 --> 01:19:05.575
- Yeah. Why not?
- I'd like to see her to the car.

1005
01:19:05.659 --> 01:19:08.411
- She knows where it's at.
- I'll stay.

1006
01:19:09.162 --> 01:19:10.747
Get in the car.

1007
01:20:31.411 --> 01:20:33.121
Maid's night off?

1008
01:20:34.414 --> 01:20:37.042
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

1009
01:20:37.125 --> 01:20:41.087
- Nobody's here, that's why.
- I gave everyone the night off.

1010
01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:44.132
Easy. It's an innocent question.

1011
01:20:44.257 --> 01:20:47.302
No question from you
is innocent, Mr. Gittes.

1012
01:20:47.427 --> 01:20:49.304
I guess you're right.

1013
01:20:52.349 --> 01:20:54.267
To you, Mrs. Mulwray.

1014
01:20:55.602 --> 01:20:58.104
Frankly, tonight, you saved my...

1015
01:20:58.355 --> 01:21:00.190
You saved my neck.

1016
01:21:03.318 --> 01:21:05.153
Tell me, Mr. Gittes,

1017
01:21:06.488 --> 01:21:08.865
does this often happen to you?

1018
01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:11.951
What's that?

1019
01:21:12.827 --> 01:21:15.622
Well, I'm judging only on the basis
of one afternoon and an evening,

1020
01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:17.916
but if this is how you go
about your work,

1021
01:21:17.999 --> 01:21:21.795
I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a whole day.

1022
01:21:23.463 --> 01:21:26.257
Actually, this hasn't happened to me
for a long time.

1023
01:21:26.341 --> 01:21:28.343
When was the last time?

1024
01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:30.053
Why?

1025
01:21:30.804 --> 01:21:32.972
It's an innocent question.

1026
01:21:37.644 --> 01:21:40.980
- In Chinatown.
- What were you doing there?

1027
01:21:43.316 --> 01:21:46.778
- Working for the District Attorney.
- Doing what?

1028
01:21:46.861 --> 01:21:48.613
As little as possible.

and I'll get back to you.

1204
01:42:07.456 --> 01:42:11.001
- Now I'd like to go home.
- I want the other pictures, Gittes.

1205
01:42:11.084 --> 01:42:12.628
What pictures?

1206
01:42:13.378 --> 01:42:16.840
This broad hired you,
not Evelyn Mulwray.

1207
01:42:16.923 --> 01:42:18.383
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1208
01:42:19.468 --> 01:42:21.178
Somebody wanted
to shake Mulwray down,

1209
01:42:21.261 --> 01:42:22.846
she hired you.

1210
01:42:22.929 --> 01:42:25.432
That's how come you found out
he was murdered.

1211
01:42:25.515 --> 01:42:28.560
- I heard it was an accident.
- Come on, Gittes.

1212
01:42:28.644 --> 01:42:32.022
Who the hell do you think you're
dealing with, a bunch of assholes?

1213
01:42:32.105 --> 01:42:34.441
Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.

1214
01:42:36.485 --> 01:42:39.446
You were following him day and night.
You saw who killed him.

1215
01:42:39.529 --> 01:42:41.573
You even took pictures of it.

1216
01:42:41.657 --> 01:42:42.824
It was Evelyn Mulwray,

1217
01:42:42.908 --> 01:42:46.161
and she's been paying you off
like a slot machine ever since.

1218
01:42:46.244 --> 01:42:49.039
- You accusing me of extortion?
- Absolutely.

1219
01:42:49.122 --> 01:42:50.832
I don't think I need a day or two.

1220
01:42:50.916 --> 01:42:53.085
You're dumber than you think
I think you are.

1221
01:42:53.168 --> 01:42:56.213
Not only that, but I wouldn't extort
a nickel from my worst enemy, Escobar.

1222
01:42:56.296 --> 01:42:57.923
That's where I draw the line.

1223
01:42:58.006 --> 01:43:00.175
I want the rest of the pictures, Gittes.

1224
01:43:00.258 --> 01:43:02.010
We're talking about accessory
after the fact,

1225
01:43:02.094 --> 01:43:03.804
conspiracy, and extortion, minimum.

1226
01:43:03.887 --> 01:43:06.348
What do you think, Evelyn Mulwray
knocked off her husband in the ocean,

1227
01:43:06.431 --> 01:43:07.766
then dragged him up to a reservoir

1228
01:43:07.849 --> 01:43:10.686
because she thought
it would look more like an accident?

1229
01:43:10.894 --> 01:43:12.020
(SCOFFING)

1230
01:43:12.104 --> 01:43:13.438
Mulwray was murdered and moved

1231
01:43:13.522 --> 01:43:17.275
because somebody didn't want his body
found in the ocean.

1232
01:43:17.359 --> 01:43:18.402
Why is that?

1233
01:43:18.485 --> 01:43:20.445
He found out
they were dumping water there.

1234
01:43:20.529 --> 01:43:23.490
That's what they were trying to cover up.

1235
01:43:24.408 --> 01:43:28.370
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come on. I'll show you.

1236
01:43:29.579 --> 01:43:32.833
Come on, Lou.
You're in charge. Make a decision.

1237
01:43:47.639 --> 01:43:49.808
(SCOFFING)

1238
01:43:50.934 --> 01:43:52.686
- It's too late.
- Too late for what?

1239
01:43:52.769 --> 01:43:55.355
They only dump the water at night.

1240
01:43:57.065 --> 01:44:00.068
- Reach anybody?
- Yelburton. He's the new chief.

1241
01:44:00.152 --> 01:44:02.904
- Yeah, I know who he is. Go on!
- He says...

1242
01:44:02.988 --> 01:44:05.365
- I know what he says.
- Shut up.

1243
01:44:06.867 --> 01:44:07.951
Go on!

1244
01:44:08.034 --> 01:44:09.911
Yelburton says there's irrigation
in the Valley,

1245
01:44:09.995 --> 01:44:12.205
and there's always a little run-off
after they do that.

1246
01:44:12.289 --> 01:44:13.832
And he says Gittes knows this,

1247
01:44:13.915 --> 01:44:18.420
and he's been going around making
irresponsible accusations all last week.

1248
01:44:18.503 --> 01:44:20.213
Lou, let's swear out a warrant
for her arrest.

1249
01:44:20.297 --> 01:44:22.132
What the hell are we waiting for?

1250
01:44:22.215 --> 01:44:26.845
He just made lieutenant.
Wants to hang on to his little gold bar.

1251
01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.101
Have your client in my office
in two hours.

1252
01:44:33.185 --> 01:44:35.729
And remember,
I don't have to let you go.

1253
01:44:35.812 --> 01:44:38.899
I've got you right now
for withholding evidence.

1254
01:44:40.066 --> 01:44:41.318
Loach?

1255
01:45:26.947 --> 01:45:28.824
Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

1256
01:45:30.534 --> 01:45:32.160
These her bags?

1257
01:45:34.788 --> 01:45:36.790
Is she going on a trip?

1258
01:45:37.541 --> 01:45:40.460
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

1259
01:45:40.544 --> 01:45:43.964
- Is she going on a vacation?
- Mrs. Mulwray no home.

1260
01:45:44.339 --> 01:45:48.426
"Mrs. Mulwray no home."
Well, I'll just have a look around, huh?

1261
01:45:55.559 --> 01:45:57.519
Yeah, yeah. Bad for the glass.

1262
01:45:57.602 --> 01:45:59.938
Oh, yes. Bad for glass.

1263
01:46:00.438 --> 01:46:02.774
Salt water very bad for grass.

1264
01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:19.916
Salt water?

1265
01:46:20.584 --> 01:46:23.378
Very, very bad. See?

1266
01:46:32.262 --> 01:46:33.722
- What's that?
- Huh?

1267
01:46:35.473 --> 01:46:36.933
Right there.

1268
01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:41.980
There.

01:47:39.746 --> 01:47:41.623

1272
01:47:47.212 --> 01:47:49.464
How are you? I've been calling you.

1273
01:47:49.547 --> 01:47:51.007
- Yeah?
- It's all right, Kahn.

1274
01:47:51.091 --> 01:47:53.259
- Have you slept?
- Sure.

1275
01:47:54.386 --> 01:47:56.763
Have you had lunch?
Kahn can fix you something.

1276
01:47:56.846 --> 01:48:00.058
- Where's the girl?
- Upstairs. Why?

1277
01:48:00.141 --> 01:48:01.893
I want to see her.

1278
01:48:02.268 --> 01:48:06.231
She's having a bath right now.
Why do you want to see her?

1279
01:48:06.314 --> 01:48:07.983
Going someplace?

1280
01:48:08.942 --> 01:48:11.695
Yes. We have a 5:30 train to catch.

1281
01:48:15.490 --> 01:48:16.741
Jake?

1282
01:48:26.292 --> 01:48:28.878
J.J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar.

1283
01:48:29.254 --> 01:48:32.007
But... Now look, what's the matter?
What's wrong?

1284
01:48:32.090 --> 01:48:36.219
- I told you, we have a 5:30...
- You're going to miss your train.

1285
01:48:36.678 --> 01:48:37.929

<i>- Yeah.</i>

1287

Meet me at 1972 Canyon Drive.

<i>(LOU CHATTERING ON PHONE)</i>

1289
01:48:43.727 --> 01:48:45.770
Yeah. Soon as you can.

1290
01:48:46.688 --> 01:48:48.565
Why did you do that?

1291
01:48:48.982 --> 01:48:51.860
- You know any good criminal lawyers?
- No.

1292
01:48:53.737 --> 01:48:56.531
Don't worry, I can recommend a couple.

1293
01:48:57.073 --> 01:49:00.035
They're expensive, but you can afford it.

1294
01:49:00.827 --> 01:49:04.039
Will you please tell me
what this is all about?

1295
01:49:16.009 --> 01:49:19.012
I found these in your backyard
in the pond.

1296
01:49:20.096 --> 01:49:22.849
They belonged to your husband,
didn't they?

1297
01:49:22.932 --> 01:49:24.434
Didn't they?

1298
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:28.605
- I don't know. Yes, probably.
- Yes, positively.

1299
01:49:28.688 --> 01:49:30.774
It's where he was drowned.

1300
01:49:30.982 --> 01:49:32.025
What?

1301
01:49:32.108 --> 01:49:34.736
There's no time
to be shocked by the truth.

1302
01:49:34.819 --> 01:49:36.321
The coroner's report proves

1303
01:49:36.404 --> 01:49:38.782
that he had salt water in his lungs
when he was killed.

1304
01:49:38.865 --> 01:49:40.241
Just take my word for it, all right?

1305
01:49:40.325 --> 01:49:42.410
Now, I want to know how it happened,
and I want to know why,

1306
01:49:42.494 --> 01:49:44.537
and I want to know
before Escobar gets here,

1307
01:49:44.621 --> 01:49:46.581
because I don't want to lose my license.

1308
01:49:46.664 --> 01:49:50.752
I don't know what you are talking about.
This is the craziest, most insane thing...

1309
01:49:50.835 --> 01:49:52.337
Stop it!

1310
01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:54.172
I'm gonna make it easy for you.

1311
01:49:54.255 --> 01:49:57.008
You were jealous. You had a fight.
He fell. He hit his head.

1312
01:49:57.092 --> 01:49:58.176
It was an accident!

1313
01:49:58.259 --> 01:50:00.929
But his girl is a witness.
So you had to shut her up.

1314
01:50:01.012 --> 01:50:02.180
You don't have the guts to harm her,

1315
01:50:02.263 --> 01:50:04.140
but you got the money
to keep her mouth shut.

1316
01:50:04.224 --> 01:50:05.850
- Yes or no?
- No!

1317
01:50:07.102 --> 01:50:09.521
Who is she? And don't give me
that crap about your sister,

1318
01:50:09.604 --> 01:50:11.689
because you don't have a sister.

1319
01:50:11.773 --> 01:50:13.441
I'll tell you...

1320
01:50:13.817 --> 01:50:15.902
I'll tell you the truth.

1321
01:50:17.779 --> 01:50:19.656
Good. What's her name?

1322
01:50:21.533 --> 01:50:24.285
- Katherine.
- Katherine who?

1323
01:50:26.746 --> 01:50:28.540
She's my daughter.

1324
01:50:29.707 --> 01:50:31.709
I said I want the truth!

1325
01:50:32.252 --> 01:50:33.962
She's my sister.

1326
01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:37.090
She's my daughter.

1327
01:50:38.091 --> 01:50:40.093
My sister, my daughter!

1328
01:50:40.927 --> 01:50:42.720
I said I want the truth!

1329
01:50:42.804 --> 01:50:44.180
All of it!

1330
01:50:46.432 --> 01:50:49.227
She's my sister and my daughter!

1331
01:50:53.148 --> 01:50:55.066
Kahn, please, go back.

1332
01:50:55.608 --> 01:50:57.986
For God's sake, keep her upstairs.
Go back!

1333
01:51:05.618 --> 01:51:07.370
My father and I...

1334
01:51:11.958 --> 01:51:13.334
Understand?

1335
01:51:14.252 --> 01:51:16.379
Or is it too tough for you?

1336
01:51:25.513 --> 01:51:27.015
He raped you?

1337
01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:45.450
Then what happened?

1338
01:51:45.742 --> 01:51:47.202
I ran away.

1339
01:51:47.535 --> 01:51:48.953
To Mexico.

1340
01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:58.796
Hollis came and took care of me.

1341
01:52:01.883 --> 01:52:03.718
I couldn't see her.

1342
01:52:04.886 --> 01:52:06.304
I was 15.

1343
01:52:10.016 --> 01:52:11.976
I wanted to, but I...

1344
01:52:13.228 --> 01:52:14.646
I couldn't.

1345
01:52:17.190 --> 01:52:18.441
Then...

1346
01:52:21.152 --> 01:52:23.321
Now I want to be with her.

1347
01:52:24.072 --> 01:52:26.241
I want to take care of her.

1348
01:52:26.574 --> 01:52:28.785
Where are you going to take her now?

1349
01:52:28.868 --> 01:52:30.495
Back to Mexico.

1350
01:52:31.788 --> 01:52:36.542
Well, you can't take the train. Escobar
will be looking for you everywhere.

1351
01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:43.841
Well, how about a plane?

1352
01:52:43.925 --> 01:52:45.134
No, that's worse.

1353
01:52:45.218 --> 01:52:48.596
You better just get out of here.
Leave all this stuff here.

1354
01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:52.558
Where does Kahn live?
Get the exact address.

1355
01:52:53.393 --> 01:52:54.769
All right.

1356
01:52:58.398 --> 01:53:01.776
Those didn't belong to Hollis.

1357
01:53:02.193 --> 01:53:03.861
How do you know?

1358
01:53:04.195 --> 01:53:06.239
He didn't wear bifocals.

1359
01:53:37.729 --> 01:53:41.482

1372
01:54:41.417 --> 01:54:44.295
<i>Jesus. That's in Chinatown, ain't it?</i>

1373
01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:46.381
I know where it is. Just do it.

1374
01:54:46.464 --> 01:54:48.549
<i>1712 Alameda...</i>

1375
01:54:48.633 --> 01:54:50.760
(CAR APPROACHING)

1376
01:55:02.105 --> 01:55:04.148
(DOORBELL RINGING)

1377
01:55:17.286 --> 01:55:18.955
Come on in, Lou.

1378
01:55:20.206 --> 01:55:24.085
Looks like we're both too late.
She flew the coop.

1379
01:55:29.382 --> 01:55:32.718
I don't suppose you have any idea
where she went.

1380
01:55:32.802 --> 01:55:35.596
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Where?

1381
01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:38.558
Her maid's house.
I think she knows something's up.

1382
01:55:38.641 --> 01:55:40.810
What's the maid's address?

1383
01:55:41.269 --> 01:55:43.187
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down.

1384
01:55:43.271 --> 01:55:46.274
No, no, no, Gittes.
You're going to show us.

1385
01:55:47.024 --> 01:55:48.359
What for?

1386
01:55:49.152 --> 01:55:51.279
Because if she ain't there,
you're going downtown,

1387
01:55:51.362 --> 01:55:54.574
and you're gonna stay there
until she does show up.

1388
01:55:55.199 --> 01:55:57.827
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

1389
01:55:59.203 --> 01:56:02.123
Tell us about it
on the way to San Pedro.

1390
01:56:15.303 --> 01:56:19.098
- Let's get the little lady.
- Lou, can I ask you a favor?

1391
01:56:19.599 --> 01:56:22.351
I'd like to bring her out myself.

1392
01:56:22.435 --> 01:56:25.980
She's not armed or nothing.
She won't be a problem.

1393
01:56:26.063 --> 01:56:29.984
I just want a minute alone with her.
It would mean a lot to her.

1394
01:56:30.067 --> 01:56:31.444
And to me.

1395
01:56:32.487 --> 01:56:34.906
(SIGHING)

1396
01:56:36.073 --> 01:56:38.451
You never learn, do you, Jake?

1397
01:56:40.119 --> 01:56:41.621
I guess not.

1398
01:56:43.122 --> 01:56:44.457
(SIGHING)

1399
01:56:44.582 --> 01:56:46.125
Okay. But...

1400
01:56:48.085 --> 01:56:50.129
I'll give you three minutes.

1401
01:56:50.254 --> 01:56:51.756
Just three minutes.

1402
01:56:51.839 --> 01:56:53.591
Gee, thanks, Lou.

1403
01:57:09.649 --> 01:57:10.900
Yes?

1404
01:57:12.068 --> 01:57:13.236
Hello.

1405
01:57:14.153 --> 01:57:17.615
Mr. Gittes! Come in!
Well, this is some surprise, Mr. Gittes.

1406
01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:19.575
Call me Jake. How you doing, Curly?

1407
01:57:19.659 --> 01:57:21.661
Just sitting down for supper.
You care to join us?

1408
01:57:21.786 --> 01:57:22.954
No, thanks.

1409
01:57:23.079 --> 01:57:24.830
How about a glass of wine?

1410
01:57:24.956 --> 01:57:27.583
- Hey, honey, this is the fellow that...
- I know.

1411
01:57:27.667 --> 01:57:31.003
No, thank you, Curly, very much,
but I would like a glass of water, though.

1412
01:57:31.128 --> 01:57:33.047
Come on out in the kitchen with me
for a second, huh?

1413
01:57:33.130 --> 01:57:34.549
Sure thing.

1414
01:57:38.594 --> 01:57:40.471
- Curly, where's your car?
- In the garage.

1415
01:57:40.596 --> 01:57:42.807
- Where's that?
- Off the alley.

1416
01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:45.476
- Can you give me a ride somewhere?
- Sure, soon as we eat.

1417
01:57:45.601 --> 01:57:47.979
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.

1418
01:57:48.396 --> 01:57:51.315
- I'll tell my wife.
- Tell her later, Curl, huh?

1419
01:58:12.962 --> 01:58:15.131
(ENGINE STALLING)

1420
01:58:23.347 --> 01:58:26.392
Just drive slow for a block or two,
will you, Curly?

1421
01:58:26.475 --> 01:58:30.896
- What's this all about?
- I'll tell you in a block or two.

1422
01:58:32.189 --> 01:58:33.941
How much do you owe me?

1423
01:58:34.025 --> 01:58:37.028
Gee, Mr. Gittes,
we're going out tomorrow.

1424
01:58:37.111 --> 01:58:40.865
I know you been real good about it,
but my cousin Auggie's sick.

1425
01:58:40.948 --> 01:58:42.825
Forget it.
How would you like to pay me off

1426
01:58:42.908 --> 01:58:46.078
by taking a couple of passengers
to Ensenada?

1427
01:58:46.162 --> 01:58:49.665
- You'd have to leave tonight.
- I don't know.

1428
01:58:49.749 --> 01:58:54.086
I might be able to squeeze 75 bucks
out of it for you.

1429
01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:56.464
Maybe even 100.

1430
01:58:57.923 --> 01:59:00.885
- Plus what I owe?
- I'll throw that in, too.

1431
01:59:02.053 --> 01:59:05.640
1712 Alameda. It's in Chinatown.
Wait for me until 8:30.

1432
01:59:05.723 --> 01:59:08.726
If I don't show up,
take them to your boat.

1433
01:59:21.781 --> 01:59:23.741
You sure this is okay?

1434
01:59:24.575 --> 01:59:27.995
Curly, you know how long
I've been in this business?

1435
01:59:34.251 --> 01:59:36.420
(ENGINE STALLING)

1436
01:59:55.314 --> 01:59:59.443
Have you got your checkbook handy,
Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.

1437
02:00:00.569 --> 02:00:02.738
<i>You've got her? Where?</i>

1438
02:00:02.822 --> 02:00:04.949
Do you remember
the figures we discussed?

1439
02:00:05.074 --> 02:00:07.201
<i>Of course I do. Where are you?</i>

1440
02:00:07.284 --> 02:00:10.663
At your daughter's house.
How soon can you get here?

1441
02:00:10.788 --> 02:00:12.081
<i>An hour.</i>

1442
02:00:35.938 --> 02:00:37.815
Oh, there you are.

1443
02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:42.319
Well, you don't look too much the worse
for wear, Mr. Gitts, I must say.

1444
02:00:43.154 --> 02:00:45.156
- Where's the girl?
- I've got her.

1445
02:00:45.281 --> 02:00:47.575
- Is she all right?
- She's fine.

1446
02:00:48.159 --> 02:00:49.994
Well, where is she?

1447
02:00:50.494 --> 02:00:52.246
With her mother.

1448
02:00:53.998 --> 02:00:57.168
I got something
I'd like to show you, Mr. Cross.

1449
02:00:57.251 --> 02:00:58.419
What is it?

1450
02:00:58.502 --> 02:01:02.173
An obituary column.
Can you see all right in this light?

1451
02:01:02.465 --> 02:01:04.008
I guess I can manage.

1452
02:01:13.768 --> 02:01:15.394
What does it mean?

1453
02:01:15.478 --> 02:01:17.855
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

1454
02:01:18.814 --> 02:01:20.232
Right here,

1455
02:01:20.524 --> 02:01:22.067
in that pond.

1456
02:01:22.735 --> 02:01:24.403
You drowned him.

1457
02:01:25.654 --> 02:01:27.448
And you left these.

1458
02:01:29.658 --> 02:01:33.788
The coroner's report shows Mulwray
had salt water in his lungs.

1459
02:01:37.333 --> 02:01:41.545
Hollis was always fascinated
by tide pools.

1460
02:01:42.546 --> 02:01:44.590
You know what he used to say?

1461
02:01:44.673 --> 02:01:46.258
I haven't the faintest idea.

1462
02:01:46.342 --> 02:01:48.427
"That's where life begins."

1463
02:01:48.511 --> 02:01:50.387
Sloughs, tide pools.

1464
02:01:52.014 --> 02:01:53.098
When we first come out here,

1465
02:01:53.182 --> 02:01:55.976
he figured if you dumped water
into desert sand

1466
02:01:56.060 --> 02:02:00.022
and let it percolate down to the bedrock,
it would stay there

1467
02:02:00.105 --> 02:02:03.192
instead of evaporate
the way it does in most reservoirs.

1468
02:02:03.275 --> 02:02:06.946
You'd only lose 20% instead of 70 or 80.
He made this city.

1469
02:02:07.029 --> 02:02:08.864
And that's what you were going to do
in the Valley.

1470
02:02:08.948 --> 02:02:10.491
It's what I am doing.

1471
02:02:10.574 --> 02:02:12.326
When the bond issue passes Tuesday,

1472
02:02:12.409 --> 02:02:14.703
there'll be $8 million
to build an aqueduct and a reservoir.

1473
02:02:14.787 --> 02:02:16.247
I'm doing it.

1474
02:02:16.330 --> 02:02:17.915
Gonna be a lot of irate citizens

1475
02:02:17.998 --> 02:02:21.293
when they find out that they're paying
for water that they're not gonna get.

1476
02:02:21.418 --> 02:02:23.379
Oh, that's all taken care of.

1477
02:02:23.462 --> 02:02:27.550
See, Mr. Gitts,
either you bring the water to L.A.,

1478
02:02:27.633 --> 02:02:29.969
or you bring L.A. to the water.

1479
02:02:30.594 --> 02:02:31.720
How are you gonna do that?

1480
02:02:31.804 --> 02:02:35.641
By incorporating the Valley into the city.
Simple as that.

1481
02:02:37.351 --> 02:02:39.562
- How much are you worth?
- I have no idea.

1482
02:02:39.645 --> 02:02:40.771
How much do you want?

1483
02:02:40.855 --> 02:02:43.357
No, I just want to know
what you're worth. Over $10 million?

1484
02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:46.485
- Oh my, yes.
- Why are you doing it?

1485
02:02:46.610 --> 02:02:47.695
How much better can you eat?

1486
02:02:47.778 --> 02:02:50.030
What can you buy
that you can't already afford?

1487
02:02:50.114 --> 02:02:51.991
The future, Mr. Gitts!

1488
02:02:52.449 --> 02:02:53.868
The future!

1489
02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:56.537
Now, where's the girl?

1490
02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:58.956
I want the only daughter I've got left.

1491
02:02:59.039 --> 02:03:02.251
As you found out,
Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.

1492
02:03:02.334 --> 02:03:04.712
Who do you blame for that? Her?

1493
02:03:05.296 --> 02:03:07.131
I don't blame myself.

1494
02:03:08.382 --> 02:03:11.677
See, Mr. Gitts, most people
never have to face the fact

1495
02:03:11.802 --> 02:03:14.346
that at the right time and the right place,

1496
02:03:14.471 --> 02:03:16.640
they're capable of anything.

1497
02:03:18.809 --> 02:03:22.146
Claude, take those glasses from him,
will you?

1498
02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:31.572
It's not worth it, Mr. Gitts.

1499
02:03:33.532 --> 02:03:35.659
It's really not worth it.

1500
02:03:42.207 --> 02:03:43.250
Where's the girl?

1501
02:04:38.389 --> 02:04:41.517
You remember "Night Train"
Claude Mulvihill, don't you, boys?

1502
02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:45.145
Mr. Cross, these are my associates,
Mr. Walsh and Mr...

1503
02:04:46.397 --> 02:04:48.565
You're under arrest, Jake.

1504
02:04:50.651 --> 02:04:51.777
Good news.

1505
02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:55.531
Withholding evidence, extortion,
accessory after the fact.

1506
02:04:55.614 --> 02:04:57.950
I didn't extort nothing from nobody, Lou.

1507
02:04:58.033 --> 02:05:01.370
This is Noah Cross, if you don't know.
Evelyn's father, if you don't know.

1508
02:05:01.453 --> 02:05:03.664
He's the bird you're after, Lou.
I can explain everything.

1509
02:05:03.747 --> 02:05:04.832
- Lieutenant?
- Just give me five minutes.

1510
02:05:04.915 --> 02:05:06.000
That's all I need.

1511
02:05:06.083 --> 02:05:08.252
- He's rich! Do you understand?
- Shut up!

1512
02:05:08.335 --> 02:05:10.504
He thinks he can get away
with anything!

1513
02:05:10.587 --> 02:05:12.840
Shut up or I'm gonna lock you in
to the wheel of that car.

1514
02:05:12.923 --> 02:05:16.677
Lieutenant, I am rich, I am Noah Cross.

1515
02:05:17.344 --> 02:05:19.805
- Evelyn Mulwray is my daughter.
- He's crazy, Lou!

1516
02:05:19.888 --> 02:05:21.598
He killed Mulwray because
of the water thing!

1517
02:05:21.682 --> 02:05:22.725
- I'm telling...
- Water?

1518
02:05:22.808 --> 02:05:23.934
Would you just listen to me
for five minutes?

1519
02:05:24.018 --> 02:05:26.812
Loach, lock him to the wheel of that car.

1520
02:05:27.771 --> 02:05:30.649
Lou, you don't know
what's going on here. I'm telling you.

1521
02:05:30.733 --> 02:05:32.151
Katherine!

1522
02:05:32.317 --> 02:05:33.527
Katherine.

1523
02:05:33.610 --> 02:05:38.490
- I am your grandfather, my dear.
- Come, miss.

1524
02:05:38.574 --> 02:05:40.242
- I'm your grandfather.
- Come, miss.

1525
02:05:40.325 --> 02:05:42.036
Katherine, get in the car.

1526
02:05:42.119 --> 02:05:43.495
- Go on, go on.
- But, ma'am...

1527
02:05:43.579 --> 02:05:46.915
No, no, go back to the Hong Kong.
I'll follow. It's all right.

1528
02:05:47.583 --> 02:05:49.626
Get away from her. Get away!

1529
02:05:49.710 --> 02:05:54.548
Evelyn. Please, please, be reasonable.

1530
02:05:54.631 --> 02:05:57.051
- Come to my...
- Get away from her!

1531
02:05:57.134 --> 02:05:58.427
Evelyn!

1532
02:05:59.636 --> 02:06:02.514
How many years have I got?

1533
02:06:03.098 --> 02:06:04.683
She's mine, too.

1534
02:06:04.767 --> 02:06:07.186
She's never going to know that!

1535
02:06:09.354 --> 02:06:13.609
Evelyn, you're a disturbed woman.
