00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:12.756
Peace be with you, sisters.

11
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.659
Although, at first
I hesitated to deviate

12
00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:18.595
from the usual solemnity
of our meal times,

13
00:02:19.063 --> 00:02:21.665
I had to acknowledge
that tonight, indeed,

14
00:02:21.798 --> 00:02:23.868
should be a joyous occasion.

15
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:28.672
Sister Gertrude has been
with us for many years.

16
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.010
And celebrating the birthday
of a sister in Christ

17
00:02:33.576 --> 00:02:35.679
- summons us to-
- Nun: Whores!

18
00:02:36.247 --> 00:02:40.117
You are whores!
You are all whores of Christ!

19
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:42.920
And you will fucking burn
in hell!

20
00:02:43.087 --> 00:02:46.456
You are vain
and you are lustful!

21
00:02:46.623 --> 00:02:50.094
And I see you! He sees you!

22
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.334
Cocksuckers!

23
00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.136
...your fucking God!

24
00:02:59.703 --> 00:03:01.072
Fuck you!

25
00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:32.803
Maybe ever fretting shirt
of punishment

26
00:03:32.937 --> 00:03:35.940
give myrrh-threaded
the golden folds of ease.

27
00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.109
Your scarce sheathed bones

28
00:03:38.275 --> 00:03:39.709
are weary of being bent.

29
00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:43.613
Lo, and God shall strengthen
all the feeble knees.

30
00:03:44.215 --> 00:03:47.717
Benjamin, you remember
your Hopkins.

31
00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:49.987
- You're looking well.
- Thank you.

32
00:03:51.088 --> 00:03:53.190
Uh, what were you
doing just now?

33
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.525
Admiring the handiwork.

34
00:03:56.593 --> 00:04:00.398
Not even Solomon in his glory
was arrayed as one of these.

35
00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:03.434
And I understand
congratulations are in order.

36
00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:07.004
I heard you passed your exams,
if only just barely.

37
00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:09.040
Just as you taught me.
If you can't be good,

38
00:04:09.173 --> 00:04:10.174
be good enough.

39
00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:12.943
Right.
Good advice for all of us.

40
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:15.179
And I'm kidding, of course.

41
00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:17.348
Reports are you did brilliantly.

42
00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:20.418
How long have you been out,
a semi-free man?

43
00:04:21.118 --> 00:04:22.619
Three weeks, Father Donaghue.

44
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.422
I'm gonna take my vows
in the spring.

45
00:04:24.554 --> 00:04:27.757
And then they're talking about
taking me on at St. Joseph's.

46
00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:29.793
Perfect, Saint Joe's.

47
00:04:30.094 --> 00:04:32.595
God knows we could use
one like you.

48
00:04:33.197 --> 00:04:34.298
Days like this,

49
00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:37.268
I think the church got
it wrong with Augustine.

50
00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:41.172
Too much original sin.

51
00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.706
It seems more likely
that we were conceived

52
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:45.810
in a state of original blessing.

53
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.812
Well, don't tell
the bishop that.

54
00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:49.612
Oh, of course I wouldn't.

55
00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:53.683
Wait, the bishop?

56
00:04:55.052 --> 00:04:56.786
Why are you here Benjamin?

57
00:04:58.222 --> 00:05:00.091
Well, they called on me
to fetch you,

58
00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:02.659
the bishops
in Father Cappa's office.

59
00:05:02.792 --> 00:05:06.230
He's here? Jesus Christ. Fuck.

60
00:05:06.363 --> 00:05:08.466
And there's another
priest with them, too.

61
00:05:08.598 --> 00:05:10.267
Tall, glasses?

62
00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:13.404
It's vicar general,
isn't it, Father Exley?

63
00:05:13.804 --> 00:05:15.139
I thought this was good news.

64
00:05:15.272 --> 00:05:17.208
No, Benjamin,
it is not good news.

65
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:20.077
- It's the worst possible news.
- How do you know that?

66
00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:22.779
Ah, Christ, and they
sent you to fetch me,

67
00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:24.714
to humiliate me, no doubt.

68
00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.450
What are you even
talking about?

69
00:05:26.584 --> 00:05:29.386
Just forget it.
Thy will be done.

70
00:05:33.623 --> 00:05:35.025
Take a seat, gentlemen.

71
00:05:46.703 --> 00:05:49.039
Relax, Frank,
it's not what you think.

72
00:05:53.043 --> 00:05:54.945
I assume you're familiar
with a convent

73
00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:56.713
in the far corner
of our diocese,

74
00:05:57.181 --> 00:05:58.849
the Carmelite Santa Theresa?

75
00:05:59.283 --> 00:06:01.418
- Yes.
- Understand that this matter

76
00:06:01.552 --> 00:06:03.354
requires the utmost discretion.

77
00:06:03.854 --> 00:06:05.055
Of course.

78
00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:07.591
You have special training,
I'm told.

79
00:06:07.925 --> 00:06:11.728
All kinds. Not so much
with religious sisters.

80
00:06:11.862 --> 00:06:14.797
- Do you think this is funny?
- Let's just cut to the chase.

81
00:06:17.101 --> 00:06:18.735
Two weeks ago,
there was an incident

82
00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:21.172
with one of the sisters
at Santa Teresa.

83
00:06:21.972 --> 00:06:25.109
An incident? You're serious?

84
00:06:25.242 --> 00:06:28.245
His eminence and I rarely
leave the seat of the diocese.

85
00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:31.982
I assure you,
we are absolutely serious.

86
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.053
Does he need to be here?
I don't think he's ready.

87
00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:39.089
Frank, just stop.
They have their reasons.

88
00:06:39.557 --> 00:06:40.690
We'll get to that later.

89
00:06:41.058 --> 00:06:42.759
I have to admit,
I don't understand.

90
00:06:42.927 --> 00:06:44.195
Be glad you don't.

91
00:06:44.628 --> 00:06:47.464
They're talking about
the Holy Rite of Exorcism.

92
00:06:48.432 --> 00:06:50.901
- So, what happened?
- The signs are all there,

93
00:06:51.268 --> 00:06:53.437
spontaneous violent outbursts,

94
00:06:54.004 --> 00:06:55.973
eruptions of vile blasphemy,

95
00:06:56.173 --> 00:06:58.042
surprising feats of strength.

96
00:06:58.842 --> 00:07:01.011
Their diagnoses
was inconclusive.

97
00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:03.713
Dissociative disorder?

98
00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:06.617
Yes.
So vague it might as well

99
00:07:06.783 --> 00:07:08.219
be demonic possession.

100
00:07:12.056 --> 00:07:13.657
What
do we know about this girl?

101
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.192
She's lived there for years.

102
00:07:15.326 --> 00:07:18.395
Their record's almost a blank,
no family to call.

103
00:07:18.996 --> 00:07:24.201
No history of psychological
problems, sexual abuse?

104
00:07:24.602 --> 00:07:25.803
None that we know about.

105
00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:28.472
I almost find it amusing
you would ask that.

106
00:07:29.273 --> 00:07:31.242
This is hardly useful right now.

107
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.511
My apologies.

108
00:07:35.613 --> 00:07:37.147
But what will happen is this.

109
00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:40.884
The two of you will drive to
Santa Teresa early tomorrow,

110
00:07:41.218 --> 00:07:45.155
talk to the sisters, investigate
this poor girl's symptoms.

111
00:07:45.422 --> 00:07:48.459
Stay as long as you need to.
Use your...

112
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:52.162
judgment.

113
00:07:54.198 --> 00:07:56.300
At the very least,
we need to rule out

114
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.901
the worst case scenario.

115
00:07:58.602 --> 00:08:02.840
Possession?
Actual demonic possession?

116
00:08:03.207 --> 00:08:06.043
Right, you understand
I don't really believe

117
00:08:06.176 --> 00:08:08.912
in this medieval woo-woo?

118
00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:12.516
You understand that you're
in no position to refuse?

119
00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.053
The sisters
will be expecting you.

120
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.223
Father Cappa will help you
with anything else you need.

121
00:08:19.356 --> 00:08:21.191
You're dismissed,
Father Donaghue.

122
00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:24.461
Benjamin,
would you stay a moment?

123
00:08:25.396 --> 00:08:26.397
What did...

124
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:29.799
Oh. Gene, don't do this.

125
00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:32.036
I'm sorry, Frank.

126
00:08:33.504 --> 00:08:35.372
I'll talk to you
tomorrow morning.

127
00:08:59.029 --> 00:09:01.065
This is gonna be
difficult to hear.

128
00:09:01.699 --> 00:09:02.933
It's hard to say.

129
00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:04.601
He's been a good friend
of mine for years,

130
00:09:04.735 --> 00:09:07.271
and he's done so much
good for this parish.

131
00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:08.505
Until now.

132
00:09:09.239 --> 00:09:10.407
We're sending him away,

133
00:09:10.641 --> 00:09:12.743
far away from here,
perhaps overseas.

134
00:09:12.876 --> 00:09:14.078
What's going on?

135
00:09:14.712 --> 00:09:17.448
What is the shame
of the church right now?

136
00:09:19.616 --> 00:09:22.419
No, I don't believe it.

137
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.754
I don't either.

138
00:09:24.722 --> 00:09:27.991
But accusations have been made,
and he doesn't deny them.

139
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.562
Pray for him,

140
00:09:32.896 --> 00:09:34.064
but keep an eye on him.

141
00:09:34.565 --> 00:09:37.501
We're afraid the added
pressure is making him...

142
00:09:39.203 --> 00:09:41.538
- erratic.
- Desperate.

143
00:09:42.606 --> 00:09:44.508
Am I gonna have
to worry about...

144
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.113
- my own welfare?
- What do you mean?

145
00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:52.049
Am I gonna be safe with him?

146
00:10:06.296 --> 00:10:09.032
You're a grown man, Benjamin.
You're gonna be just fine.

147
00:10:22.479 --> 00:10:23.514
What?

148
00:10:27.618 --> 00:10:28.952
Well?

149
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.026
Sisters,
get some clean laundry.

150
00:10:38.162 --> 00:10:39.930
Hold her down, sisters!

151
00:10:40.364 --> 00:10:41.932
Oh, my God!

152
00:11:27.678 --> 00:11:30.614
What draws so many
young men to the priesthood,

153
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:32.382
not so much nowadays,

154
00:11:32.516 --> 00:11:34.886
is this beautiful vision
of service.

155
00:11:35.652 --> 00:11:37.521
- Yeah.
- I mean, don't get me wrong,

156
00:11:37.654 --> 00:11:39.289
it is a beautiful vision,
but it needs to be more

157
00:11:39.423 --> 00:11:41.024
- than that.
- I know, you told me about this

158
00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:42.659
in class, remember?
I know all this already.

159
00:11:42.793 --> 00:11:45.762
I just wanna be sure this
comes from your heart of hearts,

160
00:11:45.897 --> 00:11:48.499
not from some idea
of how to live a good life

161
00:11:48.665 --> 00:11:50.167
because you don't know
what you want.

162
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.837
Or... or you're compensating
for something.

163
00:11:52.971 --> 00:11:54.371
Or you're scared of life.

164
00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:56.975
There are plenty of ways
to live a good, meaningful life.

165
00:11:57.107 --> 00:11:58.575
I'm not scared of life.

166
00:12:00.777 --> 00:12:04.081
I've searched my heart,
and it says become a priest.

167
00:12:06.416 --> 00:12:08.352
That seems courageous to me.

168
00:12:09.186 --> 00:12:11.355
- I pray about it a lot.
- Okay, then.

169
00:12:16.593 --> 00:12:18.495
- Do you regret it?
- No.

170
00:12:19.964 --> 00:12:22.065
I don't, but... but it's tough.

171
00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:25.803
And this is really personal,
but what about chastity?

172
00:12:26.503 --> 00:12:28.505
- What about it?
- Don't you want to get a job,

173
00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.942
make some money,
meet the nice girl

174
00:12:31.074 --> 00:12:32.576
or guy?

175
00:12:32.743 --> 00:12:34.778
That'd be okay, too. I don't
know what you're into.

176
00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:37.414
I'm not into anything.
I'm taking a vow of chastity.

177
00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:44.621
Pancakes and sausage
with a side of syrup.

178
00:12:52.864 --> 00:12:56.300
At the very least, know thyself
before you jump into this.

179
00:12:56.433 --> 00:12:58.201
You got this
or you want me to do it?

180
00:12:58.335 --> 00:12:59.703
Go for it.

181
00:13:02.807 --> 00:13:04.708
Bless us, O Lord
and these thy gifts,

182
00:13:05.009 --> 00:13:07.477
which we are about
to receive from thy bounty.

183
00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:10.514
Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

184
00:13:12.282 --> 00:13:13.383
So...

185
00:13:13.952 --> 00:13:15.586
what do you know about exorcism?

186
00:13:16.353 --> 00:13:17.654
Not much.

187
00:13:18.722 --> 00:13:20.490
I know that
it's still a holy rite,

188
00:13:20.624 --> 00:13:22.593
even though the church doesn't
really practice it anymore.

189
00:13:22.726 --> 00:13:23.861
Wrong.

190
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:26.363
They do.
They just don't claim it.

191
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.699
It's all very hush, hush.

192
00:13:32.169 --> 00:13:33.537
- Thanks for telling me.
- Even if,

193
00:13:35.405 --> 00:13:38.375
in our current age,
less people believe in God,

194
00:13:38.876 --> 00:13:42.346
it seems that belief
in the devil is rising.

195
00:13:44.015 --> 00:13:46.383
Maybe that means
he's winning, I don't know.

196
00:13:46.818 --> 00:13:49.753
It seems to me that people
are just in more pain.

197
00:13:49.887 --> 00:13:50.955
Good. Yes.

198
00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:53.223
They are.
And they don't know why.

199
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.195
So they clutch at whatever
reason they can find.

200
00:13:59.097 --> 00:14:02.499
Look, I've performed exorcisms,

201
00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:05.069
five or six full ones,
with Father Rigazzi,

202
00:14:05.502 --> 00:14:07.038
who really knew the rite.

203
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.539
But I never saw anything
that convinced me

204
00:14:09.673 --> 00:14:12.609
a demon was actually
inside someone.

205
00:14:13.443 --> 00:14:16.380
But I do know
the exorcisms worked.

206
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.548
The power of faith.

207
00:14:20.084 --> 00:14:22.719
Maybe, people needed to get sick

208
00:14:22.854 --> 00:14:26.858
to some other worldly
or unimaginable degree

209
00:14:27.025 --> 00:14:31.461
and could only get well
when a priest forgave them,

210
00:14:32.195 --> 00:14:35.933
someone ordained by God.

211
00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:38.903
Hmm, maybe...

212
00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:43.107
some people just need
to walk through darkness

213
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.175
before they even
get to the light, as...

214
00:14:45.375 --> 00:14:47.511
as cliché as that sounds.

215
00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:50.313
You don't believe in demons?

216
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:59.824
I'm afraid the answer is no.

217
00:15:01.725 --> 00:15:03.127
<i>Our a way of life</i>

218
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.594
<i>is no doubt hard.</i>

219
00:15:05.328 --> 00:15:10.467
<i>It demands rigor, discipline
and strength of spirit.</i>

220
00:15:11.435 --> 00:15:13.737
<i>But, most of all,
the purity of heart.</i>

221
00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:16.306
But sometimes we falter.

222
00:15:17.207 --> 00:15:19.309
Now, understand that I have
sought the Lord's guidance

223
00:15:19.443 --> 00:15:22.080
and deliberated hard
over this decision.

224
00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:26.984
Two days ago, I requested
help from the diocese.

225
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:30.520
A priest with experience
in such matters,

226
00:15:30.654 --> 00:15:32.890
a true man of God
with the highest of reputations

227
00:15:33.024 --> 00:15:34.926
is now on his way to us.

228
00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:36.460
We will host him

229
00:15:36.793 --> 00:15:40.198
until he decides what
must be done with Sister Agnes.

230
00:15:40.764 --> 00:15:42.867
I'm told
he will arrive this evening.

231
00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:45.903
Now, it goes without saying
that I expect conduct

232
00:15:46.037 --> 00:15:48.305
of the highest standard
during this time.

233
00:15:48.705 --> 00:15:50.440
Remember who you are, sisters.

234
00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:53.044
We are not accustomed
to admitting men

235
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:55.146
within our walls, even holy men.

236
00:15:55.512 --> 00:15:57.280
So let every action

237
00:15:57.414 --> 00:15:58.582
reflect the dignity

238
00:15:58.782 --> 00:16:01.284
of your solemn vow
before Almighty God.

239
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.756
- May I ask a question, Mother?
- You may not.

240
00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.591
If you have concerns,
you may seek my counsel

241
00:16:07.724 --> 00:16:09.026
after our duties are finished.

242
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.162
We will spend the rest
of the day cleaning

243
00:16:11.294 --> 00:16:13.597
before Father Donaghue arrives.

244
00:16:14.364 --> 00:16:15.833
Sister Mary,

245
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.736
youngest in Christ
and lowliest among us,

246
00:16:20.504 --> 00:16:22.907
I'm told you were friends
with Sister Agnes?

247
00:16:23.074 --> 00:16:24.142
Yes.

248
00:16:24.307 --> 00:16:25.475
Then your hands

249
00:16:25.609 --> 00:16:27.544
must be idle least of all.

250
00:16:28.478 --> 00:16:31.481
You will clean the chapel
from floor to ceiling,

251
00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:34.018
removing every mote of dust.

252
00:16:35.052 --> 00:16:38.555
It's likely Father Donaghue
will serve mass while he's here.

253
00:16:39.489 --> 00:16:40.958
Yes, Mother.

254
00:16:53.403 --> 00:16:55.505
Here, put this on.

255
00:16:58.876 --> 00:17:01.311
- Oh, I can't wear this.
- Why not?

256
00:17:02.312 --> 00:17:03.613
I'm not a priest.

257
00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:06.150
You said at lunch
your vows are all but taken.

258
00:17:06.416 --> 00:17:07.985
Yeah,
but I haven't taken them yet.

259
00:17:08.186 --> 00:17:10.855
This is gonna cause
problems in there.

260
00:17:13.024 --> 00:17:15.492
Look, sorry, Father Donaghue,
there's just no way.

261
00:17:16.961 --> 00:17:19.997
Suit yourself.
Don't say I didn't tell you.

262
00:17:34.544 --> 00:17:36.646
I saw Father Donaghue
give mass once

263
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.415
before the sisterhood.

264
00:17:39.116 --> 00:17:40.985
It was inspiring.

265
00:17:41.718 --> 00:17:43.486
Who's that
supposed to be, his driver?

266
00:17:43.653 --> 00:17:45.022
Whoever he is, he's handsome.

267
00:17:45.156 --> 00:17:46.756
Sister, you need
\ to contain yourself.

268
00:17:46.891 --> 00:17:49.359
I'm sorry, but he looks
like a movie star.

269
00:17:49.693 --> 00:17:51.428
And Father Donaghue
isn't bad, either.

270
00:17:51.595 --> 00:17:53.396
- Sister Honey!
- What?

271
00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:56.600
We can't even talk about it?
I don't see the problem.

272
00:17:56.733 --> 00:17:58.735
It's not like I'm going
to go up to him and say,

273
00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.470
- "Oh, Father, I..."
- Sister!

274
00:18:00.704 --> 00:18:02.405
The younger one
is wearing all black,

275
00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:03.707
but no priest color.

276
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:05.508
He's probably a deacon.

277
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:34.272
I must say, I wish I was told

278
00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:36.773
your young companion
would be accompanying you.

279
00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:40.344
I find it inappropriate.
Almost insulting.

280
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.180
I'm sorry,
Mother Superior, I assumed

281
00:18:43.314 --> 00:18:45.349
- the vicar general...
- Of course, Father Benoit

282
00:18:45.515 --> 00:18:47.417
visits us for mass
three times a week,

283
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.753
but he's 77 years old.

284
00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:53.423
It's unusual enough to have
a priest stay overnight,

285
00:18:53.556 --> 00:18:55.092
let alone this young man.

286
00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:57.161
Again, my apologies Mother.

287
00:18:57.527 --> 00:18:59.830
But he is a very pious
young man.

288
00:19:00.597 --> 00:19:01.933
And I assure you,

289
00:19:02.066 --> 00:19:05.202
he is absolutely essential
for my work here.

290
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.570
Then I assume
we should look at this

291
00:19:07.704 --> 00:19:09.807
as a test of faith
for all of us.

292
00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:14.946
Benjamin, Mother Superior
is concerned...

293
00:19:15.712 --> 00:19:16.981
How should I put this,

294
00:19:17.315 --> 00:19:19.749
about having a young
unordained rooster

295
00:19:19.884 --> 00:19:21.518
loose in the hen house.

296
00:19:21.651 --> 00:19:23.586
Father, there's no need
to be crude.

297
00:19:28.426 --> 00:19:30.928
Mother Superior, I'm taking
my vows later this year.

298
00:19:31.162 --> 00:19:34.432
I absolutely assure you, with
Christ himself as my witness,

299
00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:36.499
I will remain a model
of propriety

300
00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:38.903
as long as you are kind
enough to host me.

301
00:19:41.105 --> 00:19:45.176
Well, I'll expect so,
and we'll insist upon it.

302
00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:56.686
This is Sister Ruth.
This is Sister Honey.

303
00:19:57.088 --> 00:19:58.889
- Thank you, Mother.
- Honey?

304
00:19:59.723 --> 00:20:01.558
I... I believe it's Proverbs.

305
00:20:02.093 --> 00:20:05.628
"My son, eat the honey,
for it is good.

306
00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:08.299
And the drippings
of the honeycomb

307
00:20:08.432 --> 00:20:09.766
are sweet to the taste."

308
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.470
Oh, my God, stop.

309
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:14.637
Sister, that's enough.
Leave them be.

310
00:20:15.139 --> 00:20:17.041
Have Sister Mary
take their dirty things

311
00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:19.509
- when they're through.
- Yes, Mother.

312
00:20:21.979 --> 00:20:25.850
And afterward, we should do
what we came here to do.

313
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.617
The sooner, the better.

314
00:20:27.818 --> 00:20:30.187
Mother, forgive me,
one last thing.

315
00:20:30.821 --> 00:20:33.523
Do you happen to have any wine?

316
00:20:34.724 --> 00:20:36.327
"And they said of him,

317
00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:40.364
'He casts out devils
by the power of the devil.'"

318
00:20:40.697 --> 00:20:41.999
Careful, Mother.

319
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.603
In that passage, the Pharisees
are talking about our Lord.

320
00:20:47.171 --> 00:20:48.239
Humph.

321
00:20:50.975 --> 00:20:52.209
I thought you said
you were interested

322
00:20:52.343 --> 00:20:53.511
in this going smoothly.

323
00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:56.579
We'll be in and out
of here anyway.

324
00:20:57.348 --> 00:21:00.484
The inflicted sister probably
just needs some priest

325
00:21:00.617 --> 00:21:03.087
to come and say the magic words.

326
00:21:04.021 --> 00:21:06.790
Don't worry. I've seen this
more than a few times.

327
00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:32.516
What?

328
00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:34.285
It's Father Donaghue.

329
00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:38.389
It's not appropriate
for you to be here.

330
00:21:39.123 --> 00:21:40.623
But I imagine you knew that.

331
00:21:40.757 --> 00:21:42.026
Forgive me, Mother.

332
00:21:42.226 --> 00:21:45.229
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior.

333
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:47.932
It was a long trip today.

334
00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:50.901
And I'm not accustomed
to your way of life out here.

335
00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:54.371
I wasn't thinking,
and I should've known better.

336
00:21:54.505 --> 00:21:55.772
You should have.

337
00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:59.243
I'm afraid I'm more used
to dealing with lay people.

338
00:22:00.044 --> 00:22:02.880
Sometimes I joke with them.

339
00:22:03.514 --> 00:22:05.416
It puts them at ease.

340
00:22:06.417 --> 00:22:10.221
But here I should conduct
myself with more respect,

341
00:22:10.421 --> 00:22:12.823
especially toward you.

342
00:22:14.191 --> 00:22:18.095
Well, then I must forgive you.

343
00:22:20.431 --> 00:22:21.832
My temper is...

344
00:22:22.732 --> 00:22:25.002
It's been quite
a stressful time.

345
00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:29.273
May the Holy Spirit
guide us both.

346
00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:36.247
Now, shall we go see
about your poor lost lamb?

347
00:23:29.133 --> 00:23:31.802
Has she spoken at all
in any ancient languages?

348
00:23:31.969 --> 00:23:33.837
- No, Father.
- Has she said anything

349
00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:36.540
about any of you
she couldn't possibly know?

350
00:23:36.706 --> 00:23:39.043
Secrets or private details,

351
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.778
particularly those things
from before you took your vows?

352
00:23:41.946 --> 00:23:43.247
Of course not.

353
00:23:44.448 --> 00:23:45.950
Likely all will be well.

354
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.751
Follow my lead as we discussed.

355
00:23:49.453 --> 00:23:52.489
If you become afraid,
you can't let it show.

356
00:23:53.123 --> 00:23:56.327
You have to be strong,
but fill your hearts with love.

357
00:23:57.361 --> 00:24:00.998
If you see anything strange,
stick to the script.

358
00:24:04.435 --> 00:24:06.103
You tied her up?
You treat someone

359
00:24:06.237 --> 00:24:07.938
like an animal,
they'll act like an animal.

360
00:24:08.072 --> 00:24:09.907
The poor girl
injured herself.

361
00:24:10.174 --> 00:24:11.942
Oh. What's her name?

362
00:24:12.176 --> 00:24:14.511
Agnes.
Sister Agnes.

363
00:24:15.145 --> 00:24:18.882
Sister Agnes, can you hear me?

364
00:24:19.717 --> 00:24:21.318
Can you feel me near you?

365
00:24:25.022 --> 00:24:27.925
This looks bad,
but maybe not that bad.

366
00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:30.394
Benjamin, the holy water.

367
00:24:42.806 --> 00:24:44.541
Well, let's begin.

368
00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:51.915
- Lord, have mercy.
- Lord, have mercy.

369
00:24:52.782 --> 00:24:53.917
Christ, have mercy.

370
00:24:54.218 --> 00:24:56.920
- Christ, have mercy.
- Fuck you.

371
00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:00.658
Lord, have mercy.

372
00:25:00.824 --> 00:25:02.326
Lord, have mercy.

373
00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:03.927
Christ, have mercy.

374
00:25:04.194 --> 00:25:06.096
Christ, have mercy.

375
00:25:06.796 --> 00:25:08.332
Begone, you.

376
00:25:09.066 --> 00:25:11.201
Begone, seducer.

377
00:25:12.036 --> 00:25:14.104
Your place is in solitude.

378
00:25:14.772 --> 00:25:17.875
Your abode
is the nest of serpents.

379
00:25:18.008 --> 00:25:20.811
Get down and crawl with them.

380
00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:27.484
You might delude man,
but God cannot be mocked.

381
00:25:27.618 --> 00:25:29.887
Go to hell, cocksucker.

382
00:25:34.858 --> 00:25:37.461
It is He who cast you out,

383
00:25:38.195 --> 00:25:41.498
from whose sight
nothing is hidden.

384
00:25:41.732 --> 00:25:44.501
It is He who repels you,

385
00:25:45.402 --> 00:25:49.707
to whose might
all things are subject.

386
00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.776
Many things. Many things.

387
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.213
Is He who expels you.

388
00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.217
He who has everlasting fire.

389
00:26:09.927 --> 00:26:14.465
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

390
00:26:14.598 --> 00:26:15.966
Amen.

391
00:26:19.336 --> 00:26:23.640
Oh,
dear sweet sister.

392
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.911
That was dramatic.

393
00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:31.915
It has to be.

394
00:26:34.084 --> 00:26:35.519
It's an exorcism,

395
00:26:36.821 --> 00:26:39.623
one of the most elaborate
song and dance acts

396
00:26:39.757 --> 00:26:41.024
the world has ever seen.

397
00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:42.926
So, that was all in her head?

398
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.695
More or less.

399
00:26:45.329 --> 00:26:48.867
Look, the Carmelites
here in Santa Teresa

400
00:26:48.999 --> 00:26:52.636
belong to an entirely
enclosed order.

401
00:26:53.137 --> 00:26:54.271
In some ways,

402
00:26:54.538 --> 00:26:56.273
they're more a relic
of the old church

403
00:26:56.407 --> 00:26:58.475
than even exorcism itself.

404
00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:01.445
- Yeah, but if they...
- That's enough heaven

405
00:27:01.578 --> 00:27:04.615
and hell for one night,
Benjamin, let's get some sleep.

406
00:27:05.749 --> 00:27:07.117
I'm knackered.

407
00:27:19.263 --> 00:27:21.031
<i>God sees the truth...</i>

408
00:27:22.533 --> 00:27:24.001
but waits.

409
00:27:25.202 --> 00:27:27.671
Over 100 years ago,
Leo Tolstoy

410
00:27:28.038 --> 00:27:30.107
wrote a story with that title.

411
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.076
And it has always stuck with me.

412
00:27:33.444 --> 00:27:37.916
I find that so many of us
who devote our lives to God

413
00:27:38.115 --> 00:27:39.483
through our vows,

414
00:27:40.184 --> 00:27:43.387
spend a great deal
of time waiting.

415
00:27:44.288 --> 00:27:46.256
Waiting on God.

416
00:27:46.825 --> 00:27:48.625
It can be so easy

417
00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:53.997
to fall into despair
in this fallen world.

418
00:27:54.431 --> 00:27:58.569
How could we know this gift,

419
00:27:59.002 --> 00:28:01.605
the glory of salvation,

420
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.309
of finding our way to Christ,

421
00:28:06.143 --> 00:28:09.413
if at first we did not wander?

422
00:28:10.949 --> 00:28:14.785
How could we ever
truly appreciate

423
00:28:15.219 --> 00:28:18.989
the miracle of redemption
and grace

424
00:28:19.456 --> 00:28:23.594
if we'd not suffered tribulation
and come to darkness?

425
00:28:24.695 --> 00:28:28.532
I haven't met all of you,
but the Mother Superior

426
00:28:28.765 --> 00:28:32.369
tells me that you are a pious
and devoted bunch.

427
00:28:32.904 --> 00:28:36.473
And I am truly grateful
for the hospitality

428
00:28:36.607 --> 00:28:39.209
that you've shown us
during this time of trial,

429
00:28:39.343 --> 00:28:43.815
to me and my strapping
young buck of a companion.

430
00:28:43.948 --> 00:28:45.850
Isn't he handsome, ladies?

431
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.252
But there is one among you

432
00:28:48.987 --> 00:28:52.322
who I am most pleased
to have become acquainted with,

433
00:28:53.123 --> 00:28:58.161
one who has suffered much,
walking through a darkness

434
00:28:58.295 --> 00:29:01.565
that most of us
cannot even imagine,

435
00:29:02.332 --> 00:29:07.738
one who has endured
a true test of faith.

436
00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:11.475
God sees the truth, but waits.

437
00:29:12.209 --> 00:29:17.080
And he can always see a heart
that is fundamentally pure,

438
00:29:17.815 --> 00:29:20.651
as I know hers is.

439
00:29:21.886 --> 00:29:23.487
Okay, Sister Honey.

440
00:29:46.143 --> 00:29:47.678
What say you, dear sister,

441
00:29:48.445 --> 00:29:51.615
are you ready to join us
in the Lord's sacrament?

442
00:29:56.219 --> 00:29:57.421
We must be patient.

443
00:29:57.822 --> 00:30:00.290
Understandably, our dear sister
will take some time

444
00:30:00.424 --> 00:30:02.060
to return to her former self.

445
00:30:02.693 --> 00:30:06.396
Well, aren't you just
the sweetest old liar?

446
00:30:06.931 --> 00:30:08.398
What?

447
00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:37.127
Father Frank,
he touched my wee-wee.

448
00:30:37.327 --> 00:30:40.731
Father Frank,
he touched my wee-wee!

449
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.079
So, should we call the diocese?

450
00:30:55.278 --> 00:30:56.613
Absolutely not.

451
00:30:56.914 --> 00:30:58.950
- Well, the rite didn't work.
- You've made this worse

452
00:30:59.083 --> 00:31:00.684
- by your pride.
- Obviously,

453
00:31:00.818 --> 00:31:04.254
that was not my doing, Mother.
It ambushed us.

454
00:31:04.488 --> 00:31:05.789
So, it's an it now?

455
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.993
What she said about the child,
how could she know that?

456
00:31:09.359 --> 00:31:11.194
I thought everybody
knew about that.

457
00:31:11.528 --> 00:31:14.431
I have never seen anything
like this before in my life.

458
00:31:14.598 --> 00:31:16.767
I thought you were
supposed to be the expert.

459
00:31:17.567 --> 00:31:19.770
They were setting me up to fail.

460
00:31:20.237 --> 00:31:21.906
- Sister!
- I'm sorry, Mother.

461
00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.808
We have to call the diocese.

462
00:31:23.941 --> 00:31:28.278
You don't want that kind
of attention here right now.

463
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.449
And it's not needed. I know
someone who can help us.

464
00:31:32.582 --> 00:31:35.752
- We served in Rome.
- You mean a priest?

465
00:31:37.788 --> 00:31:38.956
Kind of.

466
00:31:43.627 --> 00:31:45.796
Cross Talk with Guy Chesterton.

467
00:31:47.698 --> 00:31:49.299
No matter
your religious beliefs,

468
00:31:49.433 --> 00:31:51.401
you're probably familiar
with the old adage

469
00:31:51.535 --> 00:31:53.370
giving the devil his due.

470
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:54.906
Well, our guest this evening

471
00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:57.141
can be said to have done
all that and more,

472
00:31:57.407 --> 00:31:59.342
tracing an unlikely career path

473
00:31:59.476 --> 00:32:01.645
through decades
of macabre service,

474
00:32:01.778 --> 00:32:05.248
casting out alleged demons,
possibly saving souls,

475
00:32:05.382 --> 00:32:07.952
and becoming a household
name in the process.

476
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:10.554
We're pleased to welcome
Father Henry Black

477
00:32:10.687 --> 00:32:12.824
in the studio with us
this evening.

478
00:32:13.757 --> 00:32:16.460
- Welcome, Father Black.
- Well, thank you, Guy,

479
00:32:16.626 --> 00:32:18.963
that was quite an introduction.
It's good to be with you.

480
00:32:19.097 --> 00:32:21.331
Now, your methods are said
to be quite different

481
00:32:21.465 --> 00:32:22.699
from the Catholic church,

482
00:32:23.034 --> 00:32:25.368
not to mention from the way
we've seen exorcism

483
00:32:25.502 --> 00:32:27.939
represented in the media
and on films.

484
00:32:28.538 --> 00:32:29.841
It's true
you were ex-communicated

485
00:32:29.974 --> 00:32:31.909
from the Church
over 17 years ago.

486
00:32:32.043 --> 00:32:33.878
Never looked back. Hmm.

487
00:32:34.678 --> 00:32:38.182
Now, I'm sure they miss me just
about as much as I miss them.

488
00:32:38.415 --> 00:32:39.851
Let's go back
to the beginning.

489
00:32:40.051 --> 00:32:43.054
When did you learn you had
a talent for this kind of thing?

490
00:32:43.587 --> 00:32:44.889
When I was a child,

491
00:32:45.223 --> 00:32:49.392
my little sister was possessed
by a demon named Bune.

492
00:32:49.961 --> 00:32:53.430
You were involved in exorcisms
from a very early age.

493
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.434
No, Bune,
he was a stubborn demon.

494
00:32:58.502 --> 00:32:59.871
He wouldn't get out.

495
00:33:00.737 --> 00:33:04.307
So, you're saying
a demon named Bune

496
00:33:04.474 --> 00:33:07.044
infiltrated your sister's body
years ago,

497
00:33:07.178 --> 00:33:10.047
and to this day
resides in your family's home?

498
00:33:10.248 --> 00:33:12.582
- Correct.
- And all this can be verified?

499
00:33:12.716 --> 00:33:14.819
It took some getting used to.
But growing up,

500
00:33:14.952 --> 00:33:18.990
I was forced to adapt
to the ways of the demon Bune.

501
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.961
I grew accustomed to interacting
with him on a daily basis.

502
00:33:24.694 --> 00:33:26.530
So, by the time I got my collar,

503
00:33:26.763 --> 00:33:28.900
I already had all
the know-how I needed

504
00:33:29.033 --> 00:33:31.468
to exorcise anything
you put in front of me.

505
00:33:31.601 --> 00:33:33.637
And yet,
with all your experience,

506
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:37.307
you were never able
to exercise the demon Bune

507
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.812
- from your sister.
- It's complicated, Guy.

508
00:33:41.545 --> 00:33:44.381
I mean, the family,
at this point,

509
00:33:44.514 --> 00:33:47.717
had become so familiar
with Bune.

510
00:33:48.152 --> 00:33:51.421
He still lives with my family,
still eats at the table,

511
00:33:51.621 --> 00:33:54.992
still sleeps in what used
to be my sister's room,

512
00:33:55.559 --> 00:33:57.527
family vacations and whatnot.

513
00:33:57.661 --> 00:33:58.963
His favorite color is green.

514
00:33:59.096 --> 00:34:01.899
His favorite dessert
is lemon chiffon cake.

515
00:34:02.033 --> 00:34:03.901
What do you say
to those who claim

516
00:34:04.035 --> 00:34:07.337
you're simply exploiting
the families you visit

517
00:34:07.504 --> 00:34:09.773
and capitalizing
on the mental illness

518
00:34:09.907 --> 00:34:11.641
of the so-called possessed?

519
00:34:11.976 --> 00:34:15.512
Let me put it
to you this way, Guy.

520
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:19.016
I didn't choose
this line of work.

521
00:34:19.616 --> 00:34:20.885
It chose me.

522
00:34:21.518 --> 00:34:23.453
God chose me.

523
00:34:24.554 --> 00:34:28.625
He put me on a path of darkness.
He put a demon

524
00:34:28.893 --> 00:34:32.897
by my side and said,
"Be not afraid, my son."

525
00:34:36.167 --> 00:34:37.367
We'll be right back.

526
00:34:50.882 --> 00:34:52.817
She's given herself
over to the devil.

527
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:54.451
She needs medical attention.

528
00:34:54.584 --> 00:34:57.387
Sisters, you forget yourselves.

529
00:34:57.654 --> 00:34:59.190
As if we don't have
enough to do.

530
00:34:59.556 --> 00:35:01.325
Sister Honey,
find out if Father Donaghue

531
00:35:01.458 --> 00:35:04.394
has stopped bleeding. If so,
clean and dress his wound.

532
00:35:04.527 --> 00:35:05.695
Yes, Mother Superior.

533
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.564
You two,
finish cleaning the filth

534
00:35:07.697 --> 00:35:09.799
that Agnes has trailed
from the chapel. Go.

535
00:35:09.934 --> 00:35:11.768
You, prepare a light meal

536
00:35:11.903 --> 00:35:13.170
to be served to the rest
of the sisters

537
00:35:13.304 --> 00:35:15.639
in half an hour.
We will gather our strength,

538
00:35:15.772 --> 00:35:17.942
after which
we will retire to our rooms

539
00:35:18.075 --> 00:35:19.643
and we will pray
for the rest of the evening.

540
00:35:19.776 --> 00:35:21.913
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, Mother.

541
00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.117
Sister Mary, Sister Ruth,
she's quiet, yes?

542
00:35:26.384 --> 00:35:29.619
She hasn't stirred since
the straps or the holy water.

543
00:35:31.055 --> 00:35:32.023
Then go.

544
00:35:32.722 --> 00:35:33.991
Sister Mary,

545
00:35:34.691 --> 00:35:36.526
since you two
were thick as thieves,

546
00:35:36.827 --> 00:35:38.262
you will attend Agnes,

547
00:35:38.863 --> 00:35:40.430
or whatever holy
remains in her.

548
00:35:40.563 --> 00:35:42.133
We might still call her
by that name.

549
00:35:42.266 --> 00:35:43.600
I can't see her.

550
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.873
You're frightened, child?

551
00:35:50.074 --> 00:35:53.144
You don't have the luxury
to be frightened.

552
00:35:55.578 --> 00:35:58.215
- Yes, Mother.
- And mind,

553
00:35:59.749 --> 00:36:03.687
if she speaks evil,
don't listen.

554
00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:14.698
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

555
00:36:14.832 --> 00:36:16.100
Blessed art thou among women.

556
00:36:16.233 --> 00:36:17.835
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

557
00:36:17.969 --> 00:36:19.602
Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners

558
00:36:19.736 --> 00:36:21.105
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

559
00:36:21.238 --> 00:36:22.840
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

560
00:36:22.974 --> 00:36:24.241
Blessed art thou among women.

561
00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:25.943
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

562
00:36:26.077 --> 00:36:27.510
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

563
00:36:27.644 --> 00:36:28.980
now and at the hour
f our death, amen.

564
00:36:29.113 --> 00:36:30.815
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

565
00:36:30.948 --> 00:36:32.283
Blessed art thou among women.
And blessed is the fruit

566
00:36:32.416 --> 00:36:33.985
- of thy womb, Jesus.
- Mary!

567
00:36:34.251 --> 00:36:35.853
- Holy Mary, Mother of God...
- Go home!

568
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.520
...pray for us sinners, now and
at the hour of our death, amen.

569
00:36:37.721 --> 00:36:39.290
- Hail Mary full of grace...
- Praise Jesus!

570
00:36:39.457 --> 00:36:40.925
Blessed is the fruit of thy...

571
00:36:41.058 --> 00:36:42.525
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us

572
00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:44.028
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

573
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:45.997
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
please pray for me.

574
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:05.515
Hey, Mary.

575
00:37:08.819 --> 00:37:09.954
Hey, Agnes.

576
00:37:26.837 --> 00:37:28.738
Are you afraid of me?

577
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:34.544
You bit off
Father Donaghue's nose.

578
00:37:36.013 --> 00:37:37.948
Well, he had a nice nose.

579
00:37:54.999 --> 00:37:59.336
I wish I'd said goodbye
to everyone before I left,

580
00:38:01.372 --> 00:38:03.074
told them how much I loved them.

581
00:38:06.243 --> 00:38:08.778
But I guess
that doesn't matter now.

582
00:38:12.817 --> 00:38:14.717
Aren't you uncomfortable?

583
00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:18.289
What do you mean?

584
00:38:19.656 --> 00:38:21.624
Come on, take that shit off.

585
00:38:45.049 --> 00:38:46.716
There, isn't that better?

586
00:38:52.123 --> 00:38:53.958
You and I have never
really been honest

587
00:38:54.091 --> 00:38:55.692
with each other, have we?

588
00:38:59.597 --> 00:39:00.898
You lost someone.

589
00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.735
- Yeah.
- I lost someone, too.

590
00:39:06.703 --> 00:39:08.239
The love of my life.

591
00:39:09.706 --> 00:39:11.175
He was my teacher.

592
00:39:13.144 --> 00:39:16.247
He could make me laugh
like no one else could.

593
00:39:17.915 --> 00:39:21.152
But I was stupid and I lost him.

594
00:39:23.521 --> 00:39:24.855
Paul Satchimo.

595
00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.126
You loved him?

596
00:39:29.894 --> 00:39:31.728
And he loved me.

597
00:39:33.998 --> 00:39:35.665
You lost your son.

598
00:39:38.169 --> 00:39:40.070
The only person I ever loved.

599
00:39:42.606 --> 00:39:44.842
You have to bury the dead, Mary.

600
00:40:02.393 --> 00:40:03.928
I'll always be with you.

601
00:40:12.036 --> 00:40:14.505
I beseech you
now for guidance, Lord,

602
00:40:14.838 --> 00:40:16.739
you whose righteousness
has always breathed

603
00:40:16.874 --> 00:40:19.643
through this convent
like the sweetest song.

604
00:40:20.277 --> 00:40:22.680
How is this wretchedness
come to pass upon us?

605
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.015
Is my service
not pleasing to you?

606
00:40:25.182 --> 00:40:26.550
What?

607
00:40:27.351 --> 00:40:29.620
- What's it?
- I'm sorry, Mother.

608
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.589
For a great many things,
I'm sure.

609
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:33.157
I think you should go see Agnes.

610
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.092
What are you talking about?
The devil is in her.

611
00:40:35.226 --> 00:40:36.660
Has it gotten into you as well?

612
00:40:36.793 --> 00:40:40.364
I don't think it's the devil.
She was kind to me.

613
00:40:40.598 --> 00:40:42.666
The devil leads with kindness.

614
00:40:42.799 --> 00:40:44.335
And why are you not presentable?

615
00:40:44.468 --> 00:40:47.404
There are men
in this house, you slut. Leave!

616
00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:10.394
Do you want me to pray with you?

617
00:41:11.161 --> 00:41:15.966
No, Benjamin, just
leave me to the wolves.

618
00:41:17.835 --> 00:41:22.339
Maybe a priest without a nose
won't seem so strange in...

619
00:41:23.474 --> 00:41:26.310
Vietnam or Croatia
or wherever the hell it is

620
00:41:26.443 --> 00:41:29.380
- they're gonna be sending me.
- That's it, think positive.

621
00:41:29.713 --> 00:41:34.018
I am thinking positive.
I'm positively fucked.

622
00:41:36.453 --> 00:41:39.089
Yeah.

623
00:41:40.524 --> 00:41:44.028
Father Black
will be here in the morning.

624
00:41:45.896 --> 00:41:47.831
Well,
that should be interesting.

625
00:41:49.199 --> 00:41:51.101
I am fucked.

626
00:41:52.936 --> 00:41:56.974
I am fucked,
I'm fucked, I'm fucked.

627
00:42:37.414 --> 00:42:38.482
Frank.

628
00:42:42.186 --> 00:42:43.554
Good to see you again.

629
00:42:43.787 --> 00:42:44.955
So what happened there, Frank,

630
00:42:45.089 --> 00:42:46.390
somebody spite your face
a little bit?

631
00:42:46.523 --> 00:42:49.026
Yeah, something like that.
Father Black,

632
00:42:49.326 --> 00:42:51.562
I would like to introduce you
to Benjamin,

633
00:42:51.695 --> 00:42:53.364
one of my best students.

634
00:42:54.064 --> 00:42:57.134
Father Henry Black
and his lovely assistant.

635
00:42:57.267 --> 00:42:58.936
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

636
00:42:59.503 --> 00:43:01.638
- I didn't disclose.
- Right.

637
00:43:01.905 --> 00:43:03.440
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

638
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.409
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

639
00:43:07.077 --> 00:43:08.445
- Who's this guy?
- I'm sorry.

640
00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:10.314
We've been under
considerable stress

641
00:43:10.447 --> 00:43:12.049
in our current predicament.

642
00:43:12.182 --> 00:43:14.017
- Benjamin, if you...
- Boy's right.

643
00:43:15.586 --> 00:43:18.823
This is not the sort of company
I'd ever allow in this convent,

644
00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:20.157
no matter what the circumstance.

645
00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:22.393
You absolutely
cannot smoke here.

646
00:43:23.227 --> 00:43:27.064
You know, I can sense
when I'm not welcome, Frank.

647
00:43:27.197 --> 00:43:28.532
I appreciate the call

648
00:43:28.665 --> 00:43:30.134
- after so long, but...
- No, no, no, no.

649
00:43:30.267 --> 00:43:32.035
- Come on, let's...
- Please, Henry, please.

650
00:43:32.269 --> 00:43:37.107
The fact is that we are
in dire need of your expertise.

651
00:43:37.307 --> 00:43:38.843
That's probably true.

652
00:43:39.643 --> 00:43:45.249
Mother, you and the sisters
in your cherished convent

653
00:43:45.382 --> 00:43:47.584
have been the most
gracious hosts.

654
00:43:47.718 --> 00:43:49.052
But now I have a request.

655
00:43:49.319 --> 00:43:51.121
Respectfully,
would you give it a rest?

656
00:43:51.255 --> 00:43:53.524
- Excuse me?
- Forgive us, Mother.

657
00:43:53.657 --> 00:43:56.260
- This is highly inappropriate.
- At this juncture,

658
00:43:56.393 --> 00:43:58.863
I don't see that you
have any other choice.

659
00:43:59.096 --> 00:44:02.332
Please escort us to Agnes

660
00:44:02.599 --> 00:44:05.569
so that we can end
this dance once and for all.

661
00:44:05.702 --> 00:44:06.937
I most certainly will not.

662
00:44:07.104 --> 00:44:10.407
Very well, then.
If you will follow me,

663
00:44:10.574 --> 00:44:13.110
I would love to introduce you
to the poor girl,

664
00:44:13.277 --> 00:44:15.646
and you can commence your work.

665
00:44:17.781 --> 00:44:20.651
Oh, what the hell?
I drove this far.

666
00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.290
I'll be notifying the bishop.

667
00:44:31.161 --> 00:44:32.463
I am curious.

668
00:44:39.736 --> 00:44:41.305
Hello there, Agnes.

669
00:44:45.075 --> 00:44:47.311
Wow, shows some good instinct

670
00:44:48.378 --> 00:44:50.815
because I'm not your friend.

671
00:44:51.782 --> 00:44:54.351
I'm not your friend at all.
No, ma'am.

672
00:44:57.054 --> 00:44:58.455
Let me ask you something.

673
00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:01.860
Do you feel like
you're welcome here?

674
00:45:02.125 --> 00:45:04.027
Is that what's going on?

675
00:45:04.461 --> 00:45:09.032
You feel like you're welcome?
Because I've looked around.

676
00:45:10.133 --> 00:45:11.535
You're in a convent.

677
00:45:12.336 --> 00:45:15.072
So... so, you're not
welcome here.

678
00:45:15.739 --> 00:45:18.742
Which means that you and I,
well, we're gonna have to...

679
00:45:19.443 --> 00:45:21.345
have this little talk,
aren't we?

680
00:45:22.246 --> 00:45:23.680
You're a disgrace.

681
00:45:23.915 --> 00:45:26.283
Well, you can sweet
talk me all you want,

682
00:45:26.416 --> 00:45:28.085
but I'm not scared.

683
00:45:28.218 --> 00:45:29.720
Fuck you, cocksucker.

684
00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.323
Oh! Yeah, you can't bruise name
with your words, either.

685
00:45:33.457 --> 00:45:35.325
I've been to all nine
levels of hell and back.

686
00:45:35.459 --> 00:45:36.961
Hell wouldn't have you.

687
00:45:37.528 --> 00:45:40.230
Well, you see, that's...
that's where you're wrong

688
00:45:40.364 --> 00:45:44.768
because I have escorted
several there myself.

689
00:45:55.279 --> 00:45:57.347
I think
I'm starting to like you.

690
00:45:58.115 --> 00:46:00.083
Well that's, that's sweet.

691
00:46:01.351 --> 00:46:02.921
Let me tell you something.

692
00:46:03.153 --> 00:46:05.055
Come here,
let me tell you something.

693
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:09.459
I love you.

694
00:46:10.895 --> 00:46:12.529
You love me?

695
00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:15.566
I do. I love you.

696
00:46:17.134 --> 00:46:18.903
And you know who else loves you?

697
00:46:19.469 --> 00:46:20.771
No.

698
00:46:21.738 --> 00:46:24.741
- Jesus Christ! Get out, demon!
- Stop, no! No!

699
00:46:24.876 --> 00:46:27.377
- Time to go! You hear me?
- No, stop, please!

700
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:29.079
- The power of Jesus Christ...
- I'm sorry!

701
00:46:29.212 --> 00:46:30.949
- ...our true Lord and Savior...
- No, no!

702
00:46:31.081 --> 00:46:32.282
- ...compels you!
- No! No!

703
00:46:32.416 --> 00:46:33.818
- And I say begone!
- I'm so sorry!

704
00:46:34.052 --> 00:46:37.521
- Begone!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

705
00:46:37.654 --> 00:46:39.523
- This has to stop now!
- Just wait!

706
00:46:39.656 --> 00:46:43.861
Child of God, for it
is He who commands you!

707
00:46:43.995 --> 00:46:47.664
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

708
00:46:47.798 --> 00:46:49.700
What just happened?
What just happened?

709
00:46:49.867 --> 00:46:53.270
It's all right, my child.
You're safe now.

710
00:46:53.537 --> 00:46:58.342
I don't understand, I...
I could... I could see, like,

711
00:46:59.343 --> 00:47:00.812
I could feel.

712
00:47:02.713 --> 00:47:04.816
It was like, it was like
I was another person.

713
00:47:04.949 --> 00:47:06.316
Yeah, well, you were,

714
00:47:06.483 --> 00:47:10.120
you were in the grips
of a creature most foul.

715
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:12.756
But it's okay, you're safe now.

716
00:47:13.323 --> 00:47:14.625
You see, folks,

717
00:47:15.425 --> 00:47:17.561
that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

718
00:47:18.328 --> 00:47:21.531
You see, if you'd have let me
have my camera crew in here,

719
00:47:21.665 --> 00:47:23.634
we could've documented
some history.

720
00:47:23.767 --> 00:47:26.670
- Nice work, Henry.
- Thank you, Frank.

721
00:47:26.804 --> 00:47:28.705
Father Black, thank you.

722
00:47:28.906 --> 00:47:31.541
No, there's no need
to thank me.

723
00:47:31.976 --> 00:47:33.310
No, I want to thank you.

724
00:47:33.443 --> 00:47:35.479
But I have to tell you,
I'm afraid.

725
00:47:35.712 --> 00:47:38.315
Well, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

726
00:47:39.182 --> 00:47:40.617
Maybe not for me.

727
00:47:41.218 --> 00:47:45.422
- Well, what do you mean?
- It's not me I'm afraid for.

728
00:47:47.324 --> 00:47:49.626
I don't understand.

729
00:47:51.929 --> 00:47:52.930
It's you.

730
00:47:57.567 --> 00:48:01.338
Oh, goddammit, son of a bitch!

731
00:48:01.672 --> 00:48:04.541
Please, praise me! God!

732
00:48:04.741 --> 00:48:06.978
Please, please! God!

733
00:48:07.111 --> 00:48:08.478
Somebody help me!

734
00:48:08.645 --> 00:48:10.114
Aren't you going
to do something?

735
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.450
Help!

736
00:48:19.023 --> 00:48:21.358
God damn you!

737
00:49:45.375 --> 00:49:46.543
Yeah, we're good.

738
00:49:47.277 --> 00:49:49.613
Hey, Wanda, do you know
if our paychecks are ready?

739
00:49:49.914 --> 00:49:52.749
Oh, I don't know. Go ask Curly.
He's in the back.

740
00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:55.519
- How are you doing?
- All right.

741
00:49:55.652 --> 00:49:57.788
Good.

742
00:49:57.922 --> 00:49:58.990
Come.

743
00:50:03.861 --> 00:50:06.363
Hey, I was wondering if
my paycheck was ready yet?

744
00:50:06.496 --> 00:50:07.999
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

745
00:50:09.066 --> 00:50:12.502
You're...
You're that new girl, huh?

746
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:14.839
What was your...
what was your name again?

747
00:50:14.972 --> 00:50:17.141
- I'm terrible with that stuff.
- It's okay. Uh, Mary.

748
00:50:17.275 --> 00:50:19.509
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.

749
00:50:20.443 --> 00:50:22.412
Mary Jane, Mary Jane.

750
00:50:23.747 --> 00:50:25.515
There we go, I got you.

751
00:50:26.449 --> 00:50:28.252
All right, here, there you go.

752
00:50:28.418 --> 00:50:29.686
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

753
00:50:29.821 --> 00:50:31.788
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You just call me...

754
00:50:32.556 --> 00:50:34.591
call me Curly, all right?

755
00:50:35.193 --> 00:50:36.260
Today your day off?

756
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.461
Yeah, I'm working
a double tomorrow.

757
00:50:38.628 --> 00:50:41.032
Oh, nice.
Well, you enjoy your day.

758
00:50:42.666 --> 00:50:43.800
Yeah, you too.

759
00:50:43.935 --> 00:50:45.535
Used to be a nun, huh?

760
00:50:46.804 --> 00:50:49.472
- Yeah, I was.
- Golly.

761
00:50:50.875 --> 00:50:52.676
I've always wanted
to meet a nun.

762
00:50:53.311 --> 00:50:55.847
Well, I'm sure I've met
enough for the both of us.

763
00:50:59.884 --> 00:51:02.954
I bet you have.
I bet you have. That's good.

764
00:51:03.486 --> 00:51:04.688
That's good.

765
00:51:05.923 --> 00:51:07.657
Hey, listen,
I'll be the first tell you

766
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:09.626
that I don't for fraternizing
with the employees here,

767
00:51:09.759 --> 00:51:11.162
but since you're new in town,

768
00:51:11.295 --> 00:51:13.496
if you ever wanted to, you know.

769
00:51:15.365 --> 00:51:17.467
I'm out and about a lot.

770
00:51:17.734 --> 00:51:21.705
I don't know if you like
to drink or if you like wine.

771
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:25.076
I like wine.

772
00:51:27.744 --> 00:51:29.814
I like...
I like other stuff, too.

773
00:51:33.851 --> 00:51:37.088
So... When was the last time
you went out with somebody?

774
00:51:38.289 --> 00:51:39.689
I don't know.

775
00:51:40.557 --> 00:51:42.093
I guess you got
all kinds of stuff

776
00:51:42.226 --> 00:51:44.161
just stirring up inside you.

777
00:51:48.698 --> 00:51:50.400
Yeah, well,
you just think about it.

778
00:51:50.533 --> 00:51:52.136
You know where to find me.

779
00:51:54.105 --> 00:51:56.673
Hey, enjoy your day off.

780
00:51:57.041 --> 00:51:58.109
Thank you.

781
00:52:20.965 --> 00:52:22.099
Later, girl.

782
00:52:28.406 --> 00:52:30.308
Now, take care.
Thank you so much.

783
00:52:30.808 --> 00:52:32.475
Hi, how can I help you?

784
00:52:32.609 --> 00:52:33.978
I just need to cash this check.

785
00:52:34.111 --> 00:52:36.646
Sure. You have
a checking account with us?

786
00:52:37.114 --> 00:52:38.316
I don't. Do I need one?

787
00:52:38.448 --> 00:52:40.550
Yes. In order to cash
your check, you do. Yeah.

788
00:52:40.684 --> 00:52:41.953
Okay.
Does it cost anything?

789
00:52:42.086 --> 00:52:45.089
It's $25,
but we have great benefits.

790
00:52:46.723 --> 00:52:48.993
- Twenty-five?
- Twenty-five, yes.

791
00:52:54.597 --> 00:52:56.100
You have a good day.

792
00:52:59.904 --> 00:53:02.273
<i>It seems
I remember doing this before,</i>

793
00:53:02.739 --> 00:53:04.942
<i>only then
I didn't have so far to fall.</i>

794
00:53:09.847 --> 00:53:11.614
<i>Where are you now, Martin?</i>

795
00:53:59.897 --> 00:54:02.532
He brought by his dog
thinking I would babysit.

796
00:54:02.766 --> 00:54:05.503
I mean,
now what kind of lazy SOB

797
00:54:05.702 --> 00:54:08.005
would think that I would
take care of his dog?

798
00:54:08.272 --> 00:54:10.174
Just crazy son of a...

799
00:54:10.707 --> 00:54:12.810
There you go.
You have a good day.

800
00:54:13.477 --> 00:54:17.547
I sure like that tie and
that pink shirt. Looks good.

801
00:54:18.516 --> 00:54:20.084
Oh. Hey, Mary,

802
00:54:20.284 --> 00:54:22.552
- could you do me a favor?
- What?

803
00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:26.556
Curly's yapping about
some spill on aisle four.

804
00:54:27.158 --> 00:54:28.526
Would you clean it up for me?

805
00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:32.196
Please? I mean,
my back is just killing me.

806
00:54:32.729 --> 00:54:34.098
I've been standing here

807
00:54:34.265 --> 00:54:38.069
- for four hours.
- Okay, fine. Fine.

808
00:54:38.601 --> 00:54:40.570
I'll watch your register.

809
00:54:43.441 --> 00:54:45.742
What the fuck
are you talking about?

810
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:47.610
This is not the plan, all right?

811
00:54:47.744 --> 00:54:49.413
He was drunk
off the booze you made.

812
00:54:49.547 --> 00:54:50.780
- Okay?
- Oh, so it's my fault?

813
00:54:50.915 --> 00:54:52.183
- Yes.
- Listen,

814
00:54:52.316 --> 00:54:53.517
I have bills to pay.

815
00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:55.119
You have a bill to pay.

816
00:54:58.389 --> 00:55:00.858
He fucking gets drunk and
takes advantage of you?

817
00:55:00.991 --> 00:55:02.159
Go to hell, Curly.

818
00:55:11.035 --> 00:55:12.403
<i>How are you doing today,</i>

819
00:55:12.536 --> 00:55:14.171
- Sister Mary?
- I'm good.

820
00:55:14.671 --> 00:55:17.308
I just got off work and I'm
gonna go meet some friends.

821
00:55:17.908 --> 00:55:20.177
Please, if you want anything,
just help yourself.

822
00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:22.813
Well, I ain't gonna trouble
you none. I just...

823
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.482
I just need a moment
of your time,

824
00:55:24.614 --> 00:55:28.018
if that's okay with you.
You got a little bit of time?

825
00:55:28.419 --> 00:55:30.154
Yeah. Is everything okay?

826
00:55:30.321 --> 00:55:32.289
Nah, nothing like that.

827
00:55:34.125 --> 00:55:37.660
You being a nun and all, when
you came looking for a place,

828
00:55:37.794 --> 00:55:41.031
well, you know,
I gave you a special deal.

829
00:55:41.165 --> 00:55:43.400
And I appreciate it a lot.
I really do.

830
00:55:43.534 --> 00:55:44.902
Ah, it was nothing.

831
00:55:45.503 --> 00:55:47.238
It feels good to help, it does.

832
00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:50.908
But well, my wife, Ona,

833
00:55:51.876 --> 00:55:53.676
she gets bent
out of shape a lot.

834
00:55:54.111 --> 00:55:55.813
But you gotta understand,
she's a juice head.

835
00:55:55.946 --> 00:55:58.349
Been that was for as
long as I can remember.

836
00:55:58.983 --> 00:56:01.118
And when she caught wind
of me helping out

837
00:56:01.252 --> 00:56:04.321
another young woman and...
Well, she got ideas.

838
00:56:05.022 --> 00:56:07.124
- Is there something that...
- Hold on now.

839
00:56:07.258 --> 00:56:09.326
I done told her wasn't
nothing going on between us,

840
00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:11.362
but that don't mean
she listened.

841
00:56:12.096 --> 00:56:14.797
See, we have a history
that stretches far and wide

842
00:56:14.932 --> 00:56:16.000
across this city.

843
00:56:16.467 --> 00:56:18.536
And I done quit drinking,
understand,

844
00:56:18.668 --> 00:56:20.037
I don't touch this stuff.

845
00:56:20.905 --> 00:56:24.175
This ain't my doing, but anyhow,

846
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:27.278
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to break our promise.

847
00:56:27.511 --> 00:56:30.814
I know I told you
I needed 450 for this place.

848
00:56:31.248 --> 00:56:33.551
But in order to be fair
to the other tenants,

849
00:56:33.683 --> 00:56:37.087
be fair to Ona, I'm going
to have to ask for 600.

850
00:56:37.488 --> 00:56:38.889
Six hundred dollars?

851
00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:40.891
I'm real sorry.

852
00:56:41.425 --> 00:56:45.129
It ain't like me to promise one
thing and then take it back.

853
00:56:45.362 --> 00:56:49.099
Right. It's just $600
is a lot of money.

854
00:56:49.233 --> 00:56:50.800
My job doesn't pay very much.

855
00:56:51.302 --> 00:56:53.837
It's tough all over,
Sister Mary.

856
00:56:56.207 --> 00:56:57.408
I'm gonna give you
the number

857
00:56:57.541 --> 00:57:00.110
of another young woman
named Evonne.

858
00:57:00.244 --> 00:57:03.881
She works up at the laundromat.
She's always looking for help.

859
00:57:04.781 --> 00:57:06.584
It ain't much,
but maybe it'll help you

860
00:57:07.384 --> 00:57:09.719
get over the hump,
won't put you out much.

861
00:57:10.821 --> 00:57:12.289
The work's easy.

862
00:57:57.501 --> 00:58:01.305
- Hello, sisters.
- Sister Mary. Aww!

863
00:58:01.739 --> 00:58:03.240
You look wonderful.

864
00:58:03.374 --> 00:58:05.542
We just wanted
to see how you were doing.

865
00:58:05.843 --> 00:58:07.311
I'm fine.

866
00:58:08.312 --> 00:58:09.446
But how are you?

867
00:58:11.315 --> 00:58:12.383
Good.

868
00:58:15.085 --> 00:58:17.655
So, you are living in this town?

869
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:21.791
Yeah, I got an apartment
near here not long ago.

870
00:58:22.226 --> 00:58:23.627
What a coincidence.

871
00:58:23.861 --> 00:58:26.697
We're only a few stops up
the bus line at Villa Lucia.

872
00:58:26.897 --> 00:58:28.899
It must be part of God's plan.

873
00:58:29.266 --> 00:58:31.035
- Do you like it?
- Oh, yes.

874
00:58:31.669 --> 00:58:35.139
But it's very different
than Santa Teresa.

875
00:58:35.706 --> 00:58:38.275
- It's a convent in the city.
- Can you imagine?

876
00:58:39.009 --> 00:58:41.111
After Sister Agnes was put away

877
00:58:41.245 --> 00:58:43.747
and Mother Superior
laid to rest...

878
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:48.218
...the diocese thought it
best to relocate all of us.

879
00:58:48.352 --> 00:58:52.122
And the new order
is very different.

880
00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:55.225
So, what have you been up to?

881
00:58:56.026 --> 00:58:57.428
Well, I got a job.

882
00:58:57.628 --> 00:58:58.996
You're so brave.

883
00:58:59.263 --> 00:59:01.231
I always said that
you were the brave one.

884
00:59:01.365 --> 00:59:04.268
Didn't I always say that about
Sister Mary, Sister Ruth?

885
00:59:04.401 --> 00:59:07.538
Yes, she always
did say that about you.

886
00:59:08.038 --> 00:59:11.008
And also that
you were pure of heart.

887
00:59:11.141 --> 00:59:13.911
I did. I did. I did.

888
00:59:14.411 --> 00:59:16.447
We understand better than anyone

889
00:59:16.647 --> 00:59:19.750
how difficult it must've been
for you to leave the convent

890
00:59:19.883 --> 00:59:21.118
the way that you did.

891
00:59:21.385 --> 00:59:23.153
And we want you to know
we have your best interest

892
00:59:23.287 --> 00:59:25.889
at heart, but we feel that...

893
00:59:26.023 --> 00:59:29.693
Listen, we understand,
we really do.

894
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:34.131
What happened was
traumatizing, to say the least.

895
00:59:34.765 --> 00:59:37.067
We want you to know
we have your best interest

896
00:59:37.201 --> 00:59:38.569
- at heart.
- Traumatizing

897
00:59:38.702 --> 00:59:40.471
for everybody. Traumatizing.

898
00:59:41.605 --> 00:59:44.274
The Church not only
lost Santa Theresa,

899
00:59:44.408 --> 00:59:48.011
I heard it was sold last month,
but Father Donaghue as well.

900
00:59:48.145 --> 00:59:49.613
That brave and gentle man.

901
00:59:49.747 --> 00:59:51.982
- What happened to him?
- He disappeared.

902
00:59:52.316 --> 00:59:54.385
No one has seen him since.

903
00:59:55.085 --> 00:59:57.087
We know that
it's been a lot to deal with,

904
00:59:57.221 --> 00:59:58.922
and we respect your choice.

905
00:59:59.323 --> 01:00:02.192
But we would also like
to extend our welcome

906
01:00:02.326 --> 01:00:04.995
if you wanted to join us
at Villa Lucia.

907
01:00:06.497 --> 01:00:11.201
Sister Honey, Sister Ruth,
I appreciate you reaching out,

908
01:00:11.335 --> 01:00:14.705
but after all
we've been through,

909
01:00:14.839 --> 01:00:18.709
it just felt right
to put everything behind me.

910
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:20.377
We understand that.

911
01:00:20.644 --> 01:00:24.982
But may I ask you
a question, Mary?

912
01:00:25.682 --> 01:00:28.185
- Is it about Agnes?
- No.

913
01:00:30.087 --> 01:00:32.189
Do you still carry the faith?

914
01:00:37.027 --> 01:00:38.429
I don't know.

915
01:00:40.531 --> 01:00:42.800
I keep a crucifix
on the wall in my apartment

916
01:00:42.933 --> 01:00:44.435
and I pray sometimes,

917
01:00:44.568 --> 01:00:47.504
but I don't know what
it all means anymore.

918
01:00:48.439 --> 01:00:50.674
I mean, now that I'm
back in the real world,

919
01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:54.311
my time at the convent
feels like a dream.

920
01:00:56.747 --> 01:00:58.682
I keep asking for God
to guide me and...

921
01:01:01.018 --> 01:01:02.453
I hear nothing back.

922
01:01:09.126 --> 01:01:10.594
Did you know
among our other duties

923
01:01:10.727 --> 01:01:13.764
in the new order,
we service the poor.

924
01:01:14.498 --> 01:01:16.967
Yes, our soup lines
are very popular.

925
01:01:23.574 --> 01:01:25.742
Hey, I got this.

926
01:01:28.111 --> 01:01:30.614
Thanks. I'm gonna go clock out.

927
01:01:31.215 --> 01:01:34.184
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

928
01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.628
Hey, whoa.

929
01:01:45.996 --> 01:01:47.297
Who's taking over your shift?

930
01:01:47.531 --> 01:01:49.399
It's Wanda. She's out there now.

931
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.135
Can't be Wanda.
I done fired Wanda.

932
01:01:53.103 --> 01:01:54.338
- No, I didn't know.
- Yeah, well,

933
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:56.106
there's a lot
you don't know about.

934
01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:59.543
Especially what
goes on back here.

935
01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:01.078
I don't know.

936
01:02:01.345 --> 01:02:03.413
I noticed you've been picking up
a lot of double shifts.

937
01:02:04.481 --> 01:02:07.518
You're a worker.
Not like these other girls that,

938
01:02:08.385 --> 01:02:10.754
they don't care
about getting ahead.

939
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:13.757
- My rent just went up.
- Yeah, I know

940
01:02:13.892 --> 01:02:15.058
your rent just went up.

941
01:02:15.192 --> 01:02:16.693
And I get it. I get it.

942
01:02:17.394 --> 01:02:19.663
We all got stuff like that
in our lives.

943
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:22.032
Let me ask you something.
This job,

944
01:02:22.466 --> 01:02:25.569
all the double shifts,
the back-to-backs,

945
01:02:27.237 --> 01:02:28.739
is it gonna be enough?

946
01:02:30.607 --> 01:02:31.675
We'll see.

947
01:02:32.142 --> 01:02:33.577
Yeah, we'll see.

948
01:02:34.611 --> 01:02:35.712
How about this?

949
01:02:36.647 --> 01:02:40.651
How about I give you
a little extra cash.

950
01:02:42.386 --> 01:02:44.154
Then when I need a favor,

951
01:02:44.989 --> 01:02:47.691
- I can call on you.
- No, thank you.

952
01:02:49.726 --> 01:02:50.929
"No, thank you"?

953
01:02:51.094 --> 01:02:53.330
I appreciate it.
But I can't take that.

954
01:02:54.498 --> 01:02:56.466
My money's not good
enough for you?

955
01:02:57.067 --> 01:02:59.136
I'd just like to make it
my own way.

956
01:03:03.841 --> 01:03:05.309
Yeah, I can respect that.

957
01:03:08.178 --> 01:03:09.847
I'm going to get you
one of these days.

958
01:03:12.149 --> 01:03:13.650
I better go back up front.

959
01:03:13.952 --> 01:03:15.319
Yeah, go on.

960
01:03:28.498 --> 01:03:30.367
So, you're Earl's friend?

961
01:03:30.902 --> 01:03:32.135
Yeah.

962
01:03:33.136 --> 01:03:34.371
I'm his tenant.

963
01:03:34.839 --> 01:03:36.206
Mm-hmm.

964
01:03:37.207 --> 01:03:38.442
He's really nice.

965
01:03:39.309 --> 01:03:40.777
Oh, I'll bet he is.

966
01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.535
<i>Lady, if you don't know
the difference between</i>

967
01:04:05.669 --> 01:04:08.106
<i>a meatball and a matzo ball,
I cannot help you.</i>

968
01:04:09.706 --> 01:04:11.675
Anyway, please give it
up for my good friend,

969
01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:14.311
the great Paul Satchimo,
ladies and gentlemen.

970
01:04:14.444 --> 01:04:16.480
Paul Satchimo.

971
01:04:18.715 --> 01:04:20.784
Hey, everybody.

972
01:04:21.019 --> 01:04:22.386
You know what I've noticed?

973
01:04:23.353 --> 01:04:25.857
Not everybody's trying.
You ever notice that?

974
01:04:26.423 --> 01:04:29.861
Okay, I saw a guy
on the sidewalk yesterday,

975
01:04:29.994 --> 01:04:32.162
he was pushing a shopping cart
full of newspapers,

976
01:04:32.562 --> 01:04:34.098
wearing pink stretch pants.

977
01:04:34.398 --> 01:04:36.968
He was trying.

978
01:04:37.167 --> 01:04:38.936
He went to the bank
to get a loan.

979
01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:41.672
They weren't trying at all.

980
01:04:42.606 --> 01:04:45.342
I went to this bar back here
to cash in my two drink limit,

981
01:04:45.475 --> 01:04:47.644
and, man..
...they weren't trying either.

982
01:04:47.812 --> 01:04:52.416
So, now here I am,
up here trying, dead sober.

983
01:04:52.582 --> 01:04:55.019
Okay. Check this out.

984
01:04:55.153 --> 01:04:58.156
Some people are trying,
some people aren't trying.

985
01:04:58.622 --> 01:05:00.424
Some people
aren't even trying to try.

986
01:05:00.557 --> 01:05:04.294
But some people
are trying to not try.

987
01:05:05.429 --> 01:05:11.368
And some people are trying
to try not trying.

988
01:05:13.071 --> 01:05:15.106
Hey, if I thought that
could work, I might try it.

989
01:05:18.408 --> 01:05:21.278
Anyway, what do you
guys want to talk about?

990
01:05:22.013 --> 01:05:23.246
Money?

991
01:05:24.882 --> 01:05:25.850
Jobs?

992
01:05:27.284 --> 01:05:30.420
I had a regular type
job once, I did.

993
01:05:32.389 --> 01:05:34.092
I was a cold caller

994
01:05:34.926 --> 01:05:38.295
selling restaurant quality
meats at wholesale prices.

995
01:05:38.462 --> 01:05:40.098
I was not very good at it.

996
01:05:42.365 --> 01:05:43.667
One night...

997
01:05:44.301 --> 01:05:46.470
Yes, one night...

998
01:05:48.973 --> 01:05:50.007
victory.

999
01:05:51.742 --> 01:05:54.644
I sold 25 pounds
of New York strips

1000
01:05:54.812 --> 01:05:57.849
all across the greater
metropolitan area.

1001
01:05:59.117 --> 01:06:01.018
My name topped the sales board.

1002
01:06:01.485 --> 01:06:05.123
I rose from my cubicle
like a champion

1003
01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:10.727
as my colleagues watched
with... with, um...

1004
01:06:11.428 --> 01:06:12.796
with envy,

1005
01:06:13.497 --> 01:06:14.765
and disdain
because they knew...

1006
01:06:14.899 --> 01:06:16.500
...that I had been chosen

1007
01:06:16.666 --> 01:06:19.336
by the team leader, Mark,

1008
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:23.273
to enter the inner sanctum,

1009
01:06:23.573 --> 01:06:25.275
the deep freeze,

1010
01:06:26.376 --> 01:06:29.412
the deep freeze
which held a cornucopia

1011
01:06:30.948 --> 01:06:32.716
of frozen meat products.

1012
01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:34.852
And as I stood there,

1013
01:06:36.286 --> 01:06:37.521
gazing into the...

1014
01:06:38.522 --> 01:06:40.757
the glistening vista
of frozen meats,

1015
01:06:40.892 --> 01:06:45.963
Mark said to me and I quote,
"Pick anything you want."

1016
01:06:50.902 --> 01:06:52.402
Anyway, that's it.
That's the story.

1017
01:06:52.536 --> 01:06:54.906
It's not really a joke, I guess.

1018
01:06:55.039 --> 01:06:59.877
It's really more
just a 38-year-old man

1019
01:07:00.011 --> 01:07:03.147
sitting alone in his apartment,
eating three pounds of sausage.

1020
01:07:07.651 --> 01:07:10.087
You know what, that sausage
didn't make me happy.

1021
01:07:10.221 --> 01:07:14.125
Things, things do not
make people happy.

1022
01:07:14.959 --> 01:07:17.727
Do you know what does make
people happy? Do you know?

1023
01:07:19.096 --> 01:07:20.430
Connection.

1024
01:07:21.631 --> 01:07:26.770
Us, connecting in this room,
right now.

1025
01:07:26.904 --> 01:07:28.873
Forget about the sausage.

1026
01:07:29.006 --> 01:07:30.774
It's an electricity.
Do you feel it?

1027
01:07:30.908 --> 01:07:32.576
- Right now, it's happening.
- <i>It's us.</i>

1028
01:07:32.742 --> 01:07:34.377
<i>We're communicating
with one another.</i>

1029
01:07:34.511 --> 01:07:36.147
<i>That's where real happiness
comes from. I don't know.</i>

1030
01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.748
<i>Anyway, what else you
guys want to talk about?</i>

1031
01:08:03.207 --> 01:08:05.109
Frozen meats.

1032
01:08:14.051 --> 01:08:15.052
Hey, hey, hey.

1033
01:08:15.253 --> 01:08:17.687
What is so funny?
People are complaining.

1034
01:08:22.059 --> 01:08:24.228
That's what I thought.

1035
01:08:24.427 --> 01:08:26.529
Would you calm the fuck down?

1036
01:08:28.065 --> 01:08:29.499
I'm sorry.

1037
01:08:31.135 --> 01:08:32.402
Jesus Christ.

1038
01:08:45.283 --> 01:08:47.818
<i>It can't compare
to the nonsense,</i>

1039
01:08:47.952 --> 01:08:49.452
<i>She started saying things.</i>

1040
01:08:59.196 --> 01:09:01.531
And concentrate
on the things you can handle.

1041
01:09:02.233 --> 01:09:04.734
Sometimes,
I gotta pray for strength.

1042
01:09:05.403 --> 01:09:06.603
Like the good book says,

1043
01:09:06.736 --> 01:09:08.940
"Like a dog
returneth to its vomit,

1044
01:09:09.073 --> 01:09:11.309
so a fool repeats
his foolishness."

1045
01:09:11.876 --> 01:09:14.211
Mary, are you even
listening to me?

1046
01:09:20.351 --> 01:09:22.652
Hi. Do you need any help?

1047
01:09:23.287 --> 01:09:26.556
Um, no, I don't think so.
I just came in here to...

1048
01:09:27.624 --> 01:09:29.193
Wait, what do people
come in here to do?

1049
01:09:29.393 --> 01:09:32.430
Um, I can show
you how the machines work.

1050
01:09:34.432 --> 01:09:36.834
I think I got it, but thank you.

1051
01:09:37.435 --> 01:09:38.635
No problem.

1052
01:09:43.573 --> 01:09:44.909
Okay, well.

1053
01:09:45.042 --> 01:09:47.078
Yeah, just let me know
if you need anything.

1054
01:09:47.211 --> 01:09:48.179
Sure.

1055
01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:58.755
- Who's that?
- He's a comedian.

1056
01:09:58.956 --> 01:10:01.959
He don't look funny.
Is he funny?

1057
01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:04.494
Yes. He's a comedian.

1058
01:10:23.314 --> 01:10:25.216
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

1059
01:10:27.517 --> 01:10:29.519
Am I not allowed
to smoke out here?

1060
01:10:29.753 --> 01:10:30.988
It's fine.

1061
01:10:31.588 --> 01:10:33.656
Cool. You never know these days.

1062
01:10:35.826 --> 01:10:37.094
I saw your show.

1063
01:10:38.561 --> 01:10:41.765
Oh, okay. Well, no wonder.

1064
01:10:42.732 --> 01:10:44.268
Well, thanks for coming.

1065
01:10:51.842 --> 01:10:53.210
So, what did you think?

1066
01:10:53.743 --> 01:10:55.112
Of the show?

1067
01:10:55.246 --> 01:10:56.914
Yeah. Did you laugh?

1068
01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.748
- No.
- Huh!

1069
01:11:00.784 --> 01:11:02.319
Everyone's a critic.

1070
01:11:03.487 --> 01:11:05.089
It wasn't my best night.

1071
01:11:07.425 --> 01:11:08.893
But I laughed later.

1072
01:11:10.361 --> 01:11:12.063
Well, I guess that's something,

1073
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:14.697
the slow burn kind of a thing.

1074
01:11:17.234 --> 01:11:21.038
Of course, the point is
to laugh during the show.

1075
01:11:21.172 --> 01:11:24.241
That's kind of the idea,
I guess.

1076
01:11:25.742 --> 01:11:27.278
Hell, I dunno.
You know what?

1077
01:11:27.978 --> 01:11:30.247
Laugh when you wanna laugh.
It's a free country.

1078
01:11:32.782 --> 01:11:34.151
I knew Agnes.

1079
01:11:36.821 --> 01:11:38.222
Excuse me?

1080
01:11:38.956 --> 01:11:42.026
I was in the convent
with Agnes before she left.

1081
01:11:44.295 --> 01:11:45.329
Oh.

1082
01:11:46.596 --> 01:11:47.932
Wow.

1083
01:11:48.866 --> 01:11:50.167
She was in love with you.

1084
01:12:14.892 --> 01:12:16.360
You look nice.

1085
01:12:21.798 --> 01:12:25.269
I have to say I haven't
even heard her name in...

1086
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:27.938
I don't know, it's been awhile.

1087
01:12:28.239 --> 01:12:30.207
You must've known her
pretty well.

1088
01:12:31.475 --> 01:12:32.775
We had talks.

1089
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:35.778
Not a lot, but the ones we had
were important.

1090
01:12:36.679 --> 01:12:38.115
She was incredible.

1091
01:12:39.016 --> 01:12:40.683
And do you know
where she is now?

1092
01:12:40.818 --> 01:12:43.320
You mentioned
she left the convent.

1093
01:12:44.822 --> 01:12:47.224
She's in a different place now.

1094
01:12:47.992 --> 01:12:49.426
What do you mean?

1095
01:12:50.793 --> 01:12:52.296
I don't want to talk about it.

1096
01:12:53.631 --> 01:12:54.965
I understand.

1097
01:12:56.367 --> 01:12:59.069
I always wondered about her,
to be honest.

1098
01:13:00.171 --> 01:13:03.773
The minute that things
got hard between us

1099
01:13:04.141 --> 01:13:06.277
was the minute she gave up.
And I never bought into any

1100
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:08.212
of her religious horseshit,
by the way.

1101
01:13:08.512 --> 01:13:11.282
I'm sorry if I offend, but I...

1102
01:13:11.849 --> 01:13:15.853
I couldn't understand why she
went to such great lengths

1103
01:13:15.986 --> 01:13:18.455
for her salvation.

1104
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:20.925
Anyway, we were young.

1105
01:13:21.691 --> 01:13:25.462
I... I didn't usually make
a habit of dating my students,

1106
01:13:25.596 --> 01:13:29.066
but I, you know, in that case
I made an exception.

1107
01:13:30.834 --> 01:13:32.870
How long have you
been a funny man?

1108
01:13:34.737 --> 01:13:36.941
A what?

1109
01:13:38.609 --> 01:13:41.445
I guess, I don't know,
I've always been funny.

1110
01:13:41.845 --> 01:13:45.015
I, uh, I was funny
when I was a kid,

1111
01:13:45.349 --> 01:13:48.852
started putting an act
together when I was like 19,

1112
01:13:48.986 --> 01:13:52.856
and I should probably be
farther along in my career

1113
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:54.757
than I am, but...

1114
01:13:55.059 --> 01:13:58.829
But you're comfortable?
You like who you are?

1115
01:13:59.697 --> 01:14:00.931
Yeah, I think so.

1116
01:14:01.332 --> 01:14:04.068
I... I make just
the right amount of money

1117
01:14:04.201 --> 01:14:09.273
and I... I'm happy
living life the way that I do.

1118
01:14:09.406 --> 01:14:10.574
I don't,

1119
01:14:11.609 --> 01:14:15.312
I don't need fame or fortune.
I do what I love.

1120
01:14:16.413 --> 01:14:18.482
How about you?
What's your story?

1121
01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:21.385
Why did you leave the convent?

1122
01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.555
That was Agnes, really.

1123
01:14:25.389 --> 01:14:27.691
She convinced me there
was maybe more to life

1124
01:14:27.825 --> 01:14:28.993
outside the Church.

1125
01:14:30.995 --> 01:14:32.396
So, what do you think?

1126
01:14:33.497 --> 01:14:36.267
I don't think either of us
ever belonged there.

1127
01:14:39.069 --> 01:14:40.671
Is there anything
you're passionate about?

1128
01:14:41.005 --> 01:14:42.439
Anything at all?

1129
01:14:44.774 --> 01:14:46.076
I don't know.

1130
01:14:46.443 --> 01:14:50.014
The only thing I ever worked
hard for was becoming a sister.

1131
01:14:52.283 --> 01:14:55.853
Well, geez, Mary, that's about
the saddest thing I ever heard.

1132
01:14:58.222 --> 01:15:00.190
Can I ask you
a personal question?

1133
01:15:01.392 --> 01:15:03.961
Have you ever felt love
outside of God?

1134
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:15.205
Hey, Paul, don't mind us.
We just been here a few hours.

1135
01:15:15.539 --> 01:15:17.174
Are you gonna introduce
us to your friend?

1136
01:15:17.308 --> 01:15:21.378
Oh, sorry. Peter, Evelyn, Pedro.
This is Mary.

1137
01:15:21.512 --> 01:15:23.047
Nice to meet you.
He's the best.

1138
01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:24.515
I always say he's the best.

1139
01:15:39.697 --> 01:15:43.067
Anyway, here we are.

1140
01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:50.274
You can feel free
to make yourself at home.

1141
01:15:54.378 --> 01:15:56.980
I don't know, have a seat
or whatever you do.

1142
01:15:57.816 --> 01:16:00.017
I'll be right back.

1143
01:16:07.826 --> 01:16:09.293
I like your place.

1144
01:16:09.626 --> 01:16:11.128
Thank you.

1145
01:16:17.701 --> 01:16:19.470
You were the funniest man?

1146
01:16:20.003 --> 01:16:22.773
- Like in the world?
- What's that?

1147
01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.977
Oh, that? Yeah.
That was many years ago.

1148
01:16:28.011 --> 01:16:29.646
Who's the funniest man now?

1149
01:16:32.049 --> 01:16:33.450
Um...

1150
01:16:34.718 --> 01:16:36.086
I actually don't know.

1151
01:16:37.888 --> 01:16:39.156
Do you like music?

1152
01:16:39.757 --> 01:16:40.991
I used to.

1153
01:16:42.326 --> 01:16:43.427
Okay.

1154
01:16:46.797 --> 01:16:49.333
You read a lot. Books.

1155
01:16:49.533 --> 01:16:53.270
Oh, yeah. Well, as I said,
I used to teach.

1156
01:16:54.004 --> 01:16:55.606
There was a time...

1157
01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.843
I can't say that I really
have the focus to just...

1158
01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:03.447
to just sit and read a book.
I haven't for a while.

1159
01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.282
I don't know
what happened there.

1160
01:17:06.717 --> 01:17:07.985
What do you do now?

1161
01:17:08.285 --> 01:17:10.954
You mean to take
the place of reading?

1162
01:17:11.922 --> 01:17:13.323
Um...

1163
01:17:14.024 --> 01:17:17.194
I don't know. I guess I drink.

1164
01:17:23.667 --> 01:17:26.537
I have to say, I don't know why
I'm being so honest with you.

1165
01:17:26.871 --> 01:17:29.440
I know that we just met,
and I...

1166
01:17:31.108 --> 01:17:33.076
I don't know.
Well, you're not...

1167
01:17:34.378 --> 01:17:38.015
you're not the usual sort
of woman that I associate with.

1168
01:17:44.588 --> 01:17:46.590
You asked me a question
in the bar

1169
01:17:46.858 --> 01:17:48.492
before your friends came.

1170
01:17:49.426 --> 01:17:50.594
Yeah.

1171
01:17:50.761 --> 01:17:53.130
I asked you if you'd ever
been in love before.

1172
01:17:57.134 --> 01:17:58.569
The answer is yes.

1173
01:18:03.474 --> 01:18:07.311
When I was really young,
I got pregnant.

1174
01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.516
Back then, I was
a different kind of person.

1175
01:18:13.517 --> 01:18:16.787
I don't even
remember the conception

1176
01:18:16.987 --> 01:18:19.590
or who the guy was.

1177
01:18:22.559 --> 01:18:25.128
Anyway, I decided
to keep the baby.

1178
01:18:28.098 --> 01:18:29.366
And it was like...

1179
01:18:31.468 --> 01:18:34.505
a whole new window
opened up on my life.

1180
01:18:37.508 --> 01:18:42.179
I loved my son
with everything I had.

1181
01:18:44.348 --> 01:18:47.518
I loved the way he laughed.

1182
01:18:47.784 --> 01:18:50.354
I loved to hear him cry
when I left the room.

1183
01:18:50.487 --> 01:18:55.292
I loved the color of his cheeks
and his stupid little teeth.

1184
01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:00.264
I was even...

1185
01:19:02.032 --> 01:19:03.600
starting to love God.

1186
01:19:18.248 --> 01:19:21.251
<i>Then, one day,
God took my son away</i>

1187
01:19:21.385 --> 01:19:22.854
<i>and left me with nothing.</i>

1188
01:19:23.353 --> 01:19:26.123
<i>I prayed.
I begged God to tell me why.</i>

1189
01:19:26.423 --> 01:19:29.593
- <i>And he said...</i>
- <i>What'd he say?</i>

1190
01:19:32.629 --> 01:19:34.097
He said nothing.

1191
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:43.041
I don't know what lives there
in that nothingness now.

1192
01:19:43.173 --> 01:19:44.408
But he just...

1193
01:19:47.812 --> 01:19:49.146
he put a spell on me.

1194
01:20:43.901 --> 01:20:45.802
What is the matter with you?

1195
01:20:46.037 --> 01:20:48.505
Oh, I'm sorry.

1196
01:20:49.272 --> 01:20:52.043
Stop fucking laughing, then.

1197
01:20:52.376 --> 01:20:53.744
I'm sorry.
No, I'm really sorry.

1198
01:20:53.878 --> 01:20:56.047
- Why did you do that?
- I'm really sorry.

1199
01:20:58.348 --> 01:21:00.517
My face!
I have a show tomorrow night!

1200
01:21:00.651 --> 01:21:02.786
- Are you sick or something?
- No, please. No.

1201
01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.023
Just... just leave, okay?
Come on. Just...

1202
01:21:18.002 --> 01:21:20.071
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

1203
01:21:20.237 --> 01:21:21.505
Blessed art thou amongst women

1204
01:21:21.638 --> 01:21:23.007
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1205
01:21:23.141 --> 01:21:24.708
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

1206
01:21:24.842 --> 01:21:26.610
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

1207
01:21:26.743 --> 01:21:29.080
Dear God, please listen to me,
please listen to me.

1208
01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:37.088
Please, I beg you. I beg you.
I'll do anything you want me to.

1209
01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:38.488
Please just talk to me.

1210
01:21:38.622 --> 01:21:42.160
Please just show me,
show me, please.

1211
01:22:39.183 --> 01:22:40.684
Excuse me.

1212
01:22:41.651 --> 01:22:43.320
<i>Yes, I know it's a big diocese,</i>

1213
01:22:43.453 --> 01:22:44.621
but someone in your office

1214
01:22:44.755 --> 01:22:46.157
has to know
who I'm talking about.

1215
01:22:46.389 --> 01:22:48.391
He was around the tragedy
at the Santa Teresa convent.

1216
01:22:48.525 --> 01:22:49.894
I was a sister there.

1217
01:22:50.161 --> 01:22:53.563
Okay. Yes. Okay.
I can hold on, but I am at work.

1218
01:22:55.133 --> 01:22:57.835
- What the fuck are you doing?
- It's an emergency.

1219
01:22:59.369 --> 01:23:00.704
Crazy bitch.

1220
01:23:04.108 --> 01:23:05.877
Hello? Okay, hold on.

1221
01:23:08.545 --> 01:23:10.081
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1222
01:23:10.248 --> 01:23:13.350
You're sure that's
the right number? Thank you.

1223
01:23:14.484 --> 01:23:15.953
You're fired.

1224
01:23:21.926 --> 01:23:23.360
You're fired!

1225
01:23:25.163 --> 01:23:27.031
<i>You think you
might be possessed?</i>

1226
01:23:28.166 --> 01:23:29.332
That's serious.

1227
01:23:29.566 --> 01:23:32.736
No, not really, I guess.

1228
01:23:33.436 --> 01:23:34.839
You shouldn't joke about that.

1229
01:23:35.305 --> 01:23:38.075
I think I just remember Agnes.

1230
01:23:39.442 --> 01:23:40.945
Were you two close?

1231
01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:46.383
Yes. Yes, we were.

1232
01:23:47.717 --> 01:23:50.720
We had a good conversation
right before she, uh...

1233
01:23:51.588 --> 01:23:54.791
you know. Anyway,
she helped me rethink my life.

1234
01:23:54.992 --> 01:23:58.328
That's great. I never
would've guessed that about her.

1235
01:24:02.365 --> 01:24:03.767
So, how's it going?

1236
01:24:05.303 --> 01:24:06.570
Oh, I don't know.

1237
01:24:07.271 --> 01:24:10.607
I just walked out on my job,
so....

1238
01:24:12.977 --> 01:24:15.279
You know, after what
happened at Santa Teresa,

1239
01:24:15.412 --> 01:24:17.447
the Church would probably
put you up for a few months

1240
01:24:17.581 --> 01:24:18.983
if you can't make rent.

1241
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:22.887
Thanks, but I'll figure it out.
I'll call you again if I can't.

1242
01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.788
Now, I'm told
your former sisters

1243
01:24:24.922 --> 01:24:27.258
invited you to join them
at Villa Lucia.

1244
01:24:28.025 --> 01:24:29.526
Do you think
the life of a religious

1245
01:24:29.659 --> 01:24:31.128
could appeal to you again?

1246
01:24:33.231 --> 01:24:34.431
I don't think so.

1247
01:24:34.698 --> 01:24:36.167
It's different
than Santa Teresa.

1248
01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:38.668
It's less confined.

1249
01:24:40.437 --> 01:24:41.806
But if you no longer
hear the call.

1250
01:24:41.939 --> 01:24:43.241
Maybe not then.

1251
01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.976
Well, maybe not.

1252
01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:47.044
A wise man once taught me

1253
01:24:47.178 --> 01:24:48.980
it's not something
you should try to fake.

1254
01:24:51.282 --> 01:24:54.584
So, can you think of any other
work you'd be passionate about?

1255
01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.420
No.

1256
01:24:58.622 --> 01:25:00.892
You, uh...

1257
01:25:02.559 --> 01:25:03.828
Oh, never mind.

1258
01:25:04.594 --> 01:25:05.897
What?

1259
01:25:06.831 --> 01:25:08.598
It can't be that bad.

1260
01:25:11.302 --> 01:25:12.636
I had a son.

1261
01:25:13.371 --> 01:25:14.604
He died.

1262
01:25:15.339 --> 01:25:17.407
Just now, I was thinking how
much I would've liked him

1263
01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.476
to grow up and be like you.

1264
01:25:20.677 --> 01:25:22.280
And that's way too much.

1265
01:25:22.746 --> 01:25:25.049
No, it's not.

1266
01:25:26.449 --> 01:25:27.885
It's just, um...

1267
01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.656
my mother died.
I was 11.

1268
01:25:37.361 --> 01:25:38.896
So, that means a lot.

1269
01:25:43.935 --> 01:25:46.037
Can I ask you
a spiritual question?

1270
01:25:46.904 --> 01:25:48.306
Yeah,
of course, it's my job.

1271
01:25:48.438 --> 01:25:50.707
I hope I can answer it.

1272
01:25:51.842 --> 01:25:53.543
How do we know God?

1273
01:25:54.544 --> 01:25:56.013
Well, there's scripture.

1274
01:25:56.147 --> 01:25:58.715
And there's a few thousand
years of church teaching.

1275
01:25:58.849 --> 01:26:00.084
I'm not talking
about any of that.

1276
01:26:00.217 --> 01:26:04.521
I'm talking about contact,
connection.

1277
01:26:04.654 --> 01:26:07.325
How do we know God?
How do you know God?

1278
01:26:07.691 --> 01:26:09.894
- In this world?
- Yeah.

1279
01:26:14.365 --> 01:26:18.102
Okay. Yeah, I'll try.

1280
01:26:19.803 --> 01:26:23.606
Just remember, I haven't
been a priest very long, so.

1281
01:26:26.143 --> 01:26:27.144
All right.

1282
01:26:27.311 --> 01:26:28.913
Let's take this sandwich.
We're hungry

1283
01:26:29.046 --> 01:26:30.815
and it's all we've got,
but let's look at it.

1284
01:26:31.048 --> 01:26:33.451
First, there's this
terrible crappy bread

1285
01:26:33.583 --> 01:26:36.087
you've got to get through.
And that's most of it, really.

1286
01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:37.487
It's so much bread,

1287
01:26:37.721 --> 01:26:40.891
this starchy, substandard
awfulness, this filler.

1288
01:26:41.092 --> 01:26:42.927
Most of this sandwich,
most of this world,

1289
01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:44.627
just a bunch of junk
to chew through,

1290
01:26:44.761 --> 01:26:46.130
hoping that it ends soon.

1291
01:26:48.165 --> 01:26:50.633
Then you got
flavorless tomatoes,

1292
01:26:51.634 --> 01:26:53.904
this wilted lettuce.
Cheese looks like death.

1293
01:26:54.171 --> 01:26:56.474
Sauce, if you had a jar of it,
you'd probably die.

1294
01:26:56.673 --> 01:26:59.143
But hidden within all
this sound and fury

1295
01:26:59.910 --> 01:27:01.678
is a thin sliver of meat.
And that's the stuff

1296
01:27:01.846 --> 01:27:03.347
we really came here for. Right?

1297
01:27:03.481 --> 01:27:05.916
You can imagine a better
sandwich, a better world...

1298
01:27:07.351 --> 01:27:08.651
I know I can.

1299
01:27:09.753 --> 01:27:11.188
More fulfilling, with more meat.

1300
01:27:11.422 --> 01:27:13.723
Just like you can imagine
more good people

1301
01:27:13.858 --> 01:27:16.293
when you've met one
really good one, you know?

1302
01:27:17.495 --> 01:27:18.628
Okay.

1303
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:20.563
So for Christians, at least,

1304
01:27:20.697 --> 01:27:23.968
that one really good person
who brings out the best in you,

1305
01:27:24.101 --> 01:27:26.103
makes you want to bring out
the best in other people,

1306
01:27:26.237 --> 01:27:27.138
that's Christ.

1307
01:27:27.972 --> 01:27:31.175
And if you look hard enough,
he's in this world.

1308
01:27:32.843 --> 01:27:34.211
He's the meat in the sandwich,

1309
01:27:34.345 --> 01:27:36.780
this stuff we'd realize
we were really hungry for

1310
01:27:36.914 --> 01:27:39.216
if we knew ourselves
like God knows us.

1311
01:27:41.485 --> 01:27:43.320
Because Christ is God incarnate,

1312
01:27:43.454 --> 01:27:45.722
and carne means meat, flesh.

1313
01:27:46.190 --> 01:27:48.459
You know, he comes to us
in a form that we can recognize,

1314
01:27:48.625 --> 01:27:50.861
God in a meat suit like us.

1315
01:27:51.761 --> 01:27:52.997
God <i>con carne.</i>

1316
01:27:53.297 --> 01:27:56.967
But to know him in this world,
to really know him,

1317
01:27:57.101 --> 01:27:59.003
you have to deal
with the whole sandwich.

1318
01:27:59.503 --> 01:28:01.172
And if you chew through it,

1319
01:28:02.173 --> 01:28:04.707
and you keep a pure heart,
you can know God,

1320
01:28:06.143 --> 01:28:07.677
taste God.

1321
01:28:11.449 --> 01:28:12.850
You just ate God.

1322
01:28:14.018 --> 01:28:16.353
Well, he invites us to.
That's the sacrament.

1323
01:28:16.954 --> 01:28:18.956
Take this, my body,
and eat of it.

1324
01:28:20.257 --> 01:28:23.894
He invites us to the feast.
And it's a gift freely given.

1325
01:28:24.095 --> 01:28:26.629
And as long as we're willing
to open our hearts.

1326
01:28:29.333 --> 01:28:31.801
When I open my heart,
it just hurts.

1327
01:28:32.369 --> 01:28:33.736
That's right.

1328
01:28:34.637 --> 01:28:35.973
I think you know.

1329
01:28:38.476 --> 01:28:39.877
Something has to go out of you.

1330
01:28:40.144 --> 01:28:42.847
To make room
for the spirit to come in.

1331
01:28:45.416 --> 01:28:47.151
We get there by loss.

1332
01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.522
That's what spiritual hunger is.

1333
01:28:52.156 --> 01:28:54.325
And joy can follow, too,
if we let it.

1334
01:28:54.959 --> 01:28:58.129
Like we have to say goodbye
to the people we love,

1335
01:28:59.463 --> 01:29:01.265
the people we care about.

1336
01:29:05.336 --> 01:29:06.669
I'm afraid so.

1337
01:29:07.972 --> 01:29:10.007
Hopefully not too soon.

1338
01:29:13.477 --> 01:29:17.815
But no one can ever
actually say goodbye, right?

1339
01:29:24.388 --> 01:29:25.856
No.
