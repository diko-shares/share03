1
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:02.539
Peace be with you, sisters.

2
00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:05.751
Although, at first
I hesitated to deviate

3
00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.587
from the usual solemnity
of our meal times,

4
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:11.757
I had to acknowledge
that tonight, indeed,

5
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.717
should be a joyous occasion.

6
00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:18.680
Sister gertrude has been
with us for many years.

7
00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:22.851
And celebrating the birthday
of a sister in Christ

8
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.687
summons us to... Whores!

9
00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.233
You are whores!
You are all whores of Christ!

10
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.986
And you will fucking burn
in hell!

11
00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:36.406
You are vain
and you are lustful!

12
00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:39.951
And I see you! He sees you!

13
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.249
Cocksuckers!

14
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.002
Your fucking god!

15
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.921
Fuck you!

16
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.911
Maybe ever fretting shirt
of punishment

17
00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.747
give myrrh-threaded
the golden folds of ease.

18
00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:27.958
Your scarce sheathed bones

19
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.459
are weary of being bent.

20
00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:33.630
Lo, and god shall strengthen
all the feeble knees.

21
00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.718
Benjamin, you remember
your Hopkins.

22
00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.803
- You're looking well.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.056
Uh, what were you
doing just now?

24
00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.475
Admiring the handiwork.

25
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.355
Not even Solomon in his glory
was arrayed as one of these.

26
00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:53.650
And I understand
congratulations are in order.

27
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:57.070
I heard you passed your exams,
if only just barely.

28
00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:58.999
Just as you taught me.
If you can't be good,

29
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.030
be good enough.

30
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:02.743
Right.
Good advice for all of us.

31
00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:05.036
And I'm kidding, of course.

32
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.247
Reports are you did brilliantly.

33
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.375
How long have you been out,
a semi-free man?

34
00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.586
Three weeks, father donaghue.

35
00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:14.337
I'm gonna take my vows
in the spring.

36
00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.549
And then they're talking about
taking me on at St. Joseph's.

37
00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.801
Perfect, Saint Joe's.

38
00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:22.304
God knows we could use
one like you.

39
00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.222
Days like this,

40
00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:27.142
I think the church got
it wrong with augustine.

41
00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:31.021
Too much original sin.

42
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.774
It seems more likely
that we were conceived

43
00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:35.567
in a state of original blessing.

44
00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.903
Well, don't tell
the bishop that.

45
00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.321
Oh, of course I wouldn't.

46
00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.408
Wait, the bishop?

47
00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.536
Why are you here Benjamin?

48
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.915
Well, they called on me
to fetch you,

49
00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:52.667
the bishops
in father cappa's office.

50
00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:56.421
He's here? Jesus Christ. Fuck.

51
00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:58.423
And there's another
priest with them, too.

52
00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.133
Tall, glasses?

53
00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.303
It's vicar general,
isn't it, father exley?

54
00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.305
I thought this was good news.

55
00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:07.390
No, Benjamin,
it is not good news.

56
00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:10.227
- It's the worst possible news.
- How do you know that?

57
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.562
Ah, Christ, and they
sent you to fetch me,

58
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:14.689
to humiliate me, no doubt.

59
00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.441
What are you even talking about?

60
00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.277
Just forget it.
Thy will be done.

61
00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:24.825
Take a seat, gentlemen.

62
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.960
Father exley: Relax, frank,
it's not what you think.

63
00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.053
I assume you're familiar
with a convent

64
00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.680
in the far corner
of our diocese,

65
00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:48.849
the carmelite Santa Theresa?

66
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.393
- Yes.
- Understand that this matter

67
00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.228
requires the utmost discretion.

68
00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.021
Of course.

69
00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.524
You have special training,
I'm told.

70
00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:02.028
All kinds. Not so much
with religious sisters.

71
00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.531
- Do you think this is funny?
- Let's just cut to the chase.

72
00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:08.785
Two weeks ago,
there was an incident

73
00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:10.996
with one of the sisters
at Santa Teresa.

74
00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:15.250
An incident? You're serious?

75
00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:18.420
His eminence and I rarely
leave the seat of the diocese.

76
00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:21.756
I assure you,
we are absolutely serious.

77
00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:26.177
Does he need to be here?
I don't think he's ready.

78
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.889
Frank, just stop.
They have their reasons.

79
00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.640
We'll get to that later.

80
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.726
I have to admit,
I don't understand.

81
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.294
Be glad you don't.

82
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.355
They're talking about
the holy rite of exorcism.

83
00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.901
- So, what happened?
- The signs are all there,

84
00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.320
spontaneous violent outbursts,

85
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.989
eruptions of vile blasphemy,

86
00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.824
surprising feats of strength.

87
00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.785
Their diagnoses
was inconclusive.

88
00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.663
Dissociative disorder?

89
00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:56.541
Father exley: Yes.
So vague it might as well

90
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.043
be demonic possession.

91
00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.733
Father donaghue: What
do we know about this girl?

92
00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:04.966
She's lived there for years.

93
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.303
Their record's almost a blank,
no family to call.

94
00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:14.017
No history of psychological
problems, sexual abuse?

95
00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:15.769
None that we know about.

96
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.355
I almost find it amusing
you would ask that.

97
00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.066
This is hardly useful right now.

98
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.402
My apologies.

99
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.197
But what will happen is this.

100
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:30.867
The two of you will drive to
Santa Teresa early tomorrow,

101
00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:35.205
talk to the sisters, investigate
this poor girl's symptoms.

102
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:38.333
Stay as long as you need to.
Use your...

103
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:41.962
Judgment.

104
00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.132
At the very least,
we need to rule out

105
00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:47.884
the worst case scenario.

106
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.806
Possession?
Actual demonic possession?

107
00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:56.142
Right, you understand
I don't really believe

108
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.895
in this medieval woo-woo?

109
00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:02.399
You understand that you're
in no position to refuse?

110
00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.069
The sisters
will be expecting you.

111
00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.364
Father cappa will help you
with anything else you need.

112
00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:10.991
You're dismissed,
father donaghue.

113
00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.327
Father cappa: Benjamin,
would you stay a moment?

114
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.246
What did...

115
00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.499
Oh. Gene, don't do this.

116
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.793
I'm sorry, frank.

117
00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.255
I'll talk to you
tomorrow morning.

118
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.822
This is gonna be
difficult to hear.

119
00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:52.782
It's hard to say.

120
00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:54.826
He's been a good friend
of mine for years,

121
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:57.162
and he's done so much
good for this parish.

122
00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.371
Until now.

123
00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:00.498
We're sending him away,

124
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.667
far away from here,
perhaps overseas.

125
00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.085
What's going on?

126
00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.297
What is the shame
of the church right now?

127
00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:12.260
No, I don't believe it.

128
00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:13.795
Father cappa: I don't either.

129
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.724
But accusations have been made,
and he doesn't deny them.

130
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.436
Pray for him,

131
00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.064
but keep an eye on him.

132
00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.358
We're afraid the added
pressure is making him...

133
00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.404
- Erratic.
- Desperate.

134
00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.365
Am I gonna have
to worry about...

135
00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.870
- My own welfare?
- What do you mean?

136
00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.790
Am I gonna be safe with him?

137
00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.807
You're a grown man, Benjamin.
You're gonna be just fine.

138
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.363
What?

139
00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:18.660
Well?

140
00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:26.000
Sisters, get some clean laundry.

141
00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.879
Hold her down, sisters!

142
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:31.881
Oh, my god!

143
00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:20.471
What draws so many
young men to the priesthood,

144
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.432
not so much nowadays,

145
00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.809
is this beautiful vision
of service.

146
00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:27.604
- Yeah.
- I mean, don't get me wrong,

147
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.456
it is a beautiful vision,
but it needs to be more

148
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.125
- than that.
- I know, you told me about this

149
00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:32.869
in class, remember?
I know all this already.

150
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.987
I just wanna be sure this
comes from your heart of hearts,

151
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.573
not from some idea
of how to live a good life

152
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:40.221
because you don't know
what you want.

153
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.827
Or... or you're compensating
for something.

154
00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.370
Or you're scared of life.

155
00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.998
There are plenty of ways
to live a good, meaningful life.

156
00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:48.416
I'm not scared of life.

157
00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.796
I've searched my heart,
and it says become a priest.

158
00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.134
That seems courageous to me.

159
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.137
- I pray about it a lot.
- Okay, then.

160
00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:08.311
- Do you regret it?
- No.

161
00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:11.773
I don't, but... but it's tough.

162
00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.693
And this is really personal,
but what about chastity?

163
00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.714
- What about it?
- Don't you want to get a job,

164
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.949
make some money,
meet the nice girl

165
00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.659
Or guy?

166
00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.911
That'd be okay, too. I don't
know what you're into.

167
00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.205
I'm not into anything.
I'm taking a vow of chastity.

168
00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:34.462
Pancakes and sausage
with a side of syrup.

169
00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:46.391
At the very least, know thyself
before you jump into this.

170
00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.268
You got this
or you want me to do it?

171
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:49.560
Father donaghue: Go for it.

172
00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.816
Bless us, o lord
and these thy gifts,

173
00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.277
which we are about
to receive from thy bounty.

174
00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.321
Through Christ, our lord. Amen.

175
00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:05.410
What do you know about exorcism?

176
00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.495
Not much.

177
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.331
I know that
it's still a holy rite,

178
00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.559
even though the church doesn't
really practice it anymore.

179
00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:13.751
Wrong.

180
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.129
They do.
They just don't claim it.

181
00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:18.548
It's all very hush, hush.

182
00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.495
- Thanks for telling me.
- Even if,

183
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.391
in our current age,
less people believe in god,

184
00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:32.103
it seems that belief
in the devil is rising.

185
00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:36.399
Maybe that means
he's winning, I don't know.

186
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.610
It seems to me that people
are just in more pain.

187
00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:40.862
Good. Yes.

188
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.239
They are.
And they don't know why.

189
00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:47.910
So they clutch at whatever
reason they can find.

190
00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:52.582
Look, I've performed exorcisms,

191
00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.001
five or six full ones,
with father rigazzi,

192
00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:56.961
who really knew the rite.

193
00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.672
But I never saw anything
that convinced me

194
00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:02.425
a demon was actually
inside someone.

195
00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:06.137
But I do know
the exorcisms worked.

196
00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:08.348
The power of faith.

197
00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.769
Maybe, people needed to get sick

198
00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:16.981
to some other worldly
or unimaginable degree

199
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.235
and could only get well
when a priest forgave them,

200
00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:25.823
someone ordained by god.

201
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.701
Hmm, maybe...

202
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:33.122
Some people just need
to walk through darkness

203
00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.124
before they even
get to the light, as...

204
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.293
As cliché as that sounds.

205
00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.046
You don't believe in demons?

206
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.680
I'm afraid the answer is no.

207
00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.059
Our way of life

208
00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:54.685
is no doubt hard.

209
00:14:55.561 --> 00:15:00.233
It demands rigor, discipline
and strength of spirit.

210
00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:03.569
But, most of all,
the purity of heart.

211
00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:06.280
But sometimes we falter.

212
00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.426
Now, understand that I have
sought the lord's guidance

213
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.994
and deliberated hard
over this decision.

214
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.874
Two days ago, I requested
help from the diocese.

215
00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:20.628
A priest with experience
in such matters,

216
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:22.839
a true man of god
with the highest of reputations

217
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.799
is now on his way to us.

218
00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:26.342
We will host him

219
00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:30.138
until he decides what
must be done with sister Agnes.

220
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.723
I'm told
he will arrive this evening.

221
00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:36.060
Now, it goes without saying
that I expect conduct

222
00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:38.271
of the highest standard
during this time.

223
00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.440
Remember who you are, sisters.

224
00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.942
We are not accustomed
to admitting men

225
00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.069
within our walls, even holy men.

226
00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.280
So let every action

227
00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:48.573
reflect the dignity

228
00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.992
of your solemn vow
before almighty god.

229
00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.973
- May I ask a question, mother?
- You may not.

230
00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.757
If you have concerns,
you may seek my counsel

231
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.208
after our duties are finished.

232
00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.085
We will spend the rest
of the day cleaning

233
00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.379
before father donaghue arrives.

234
00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:05.673
Sister Mary,

235
00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:09.552
youngest in Christ
and lowliest among us,

236
00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:12.763
I'm told you were friends
with sister Agnes?

237
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.056
Yes.

238
00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:15.558
Then your hands

239
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.310
must be idle least of all.

240
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:21.564
You will clean the chapel
from floor to ceiling,

241
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.900
removing every mote of dust.

242
00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:28.321
It's likely father donaghue
will serve mass while he's here.

243
00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:30.823
Yes, mother.

244
00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:45.254
Here, put this on.

245
00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:51.010
- Oh, I can't wear this.
- Father donaghue: Why not?

246
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:53.387
I'm not a priest.

247
00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:56.057
You said at lunch
your vows are all but taken.

248
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.100
Yeah,
but I haven't taken them yet.

249
00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:00.686
This is gonna cause
problems in there.

250
00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:05.233
Look, sorry, father donaghue,
there's just no way.

251
00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.862
Suit yourself.
Don't say I didn't tell you.

252
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.754
I saw father donaghue
give mass once

253
00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:28.130
before the sisterhood.

254
00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:30.883
It was inspiring.

255
00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:33.439
Who's that
supposed to be, his driver?

256
00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:35.179
Whoever he is, he's handsome.

257
00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:36.889
Sister, you need
to contain yourself.

258
00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.308
I'm sorry, but he looks
like a movie star.

259
00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.394
And father donaghue
isn't bad, either.

260
00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:43.354
- Sister honey!
- What?

261
00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:46.691
We can't even talk about it?
I don't see the problem.

262
00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:48.859
It's not like I'm going
to go up to him and say,

263
00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.444
- "oh, father, I..."
- Sister!

264
00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.363
The younger one
is wearing all black,

265
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.823
but no priest color.

266
00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.241
He's probably a Deacon.

267
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:24.520
I must say, I wish I was told

268
00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:26.814
your young companion
would be accompanying you.

269
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:30.276
I find it inappropriate.
Almost insulting.

270
00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:33.321
I'm sorry,
mother superior, I assumed

271
00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:35.407
- the vicar general...
- Of course, father benoit

272
00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:37.408
visits us for mass
three times a week,

273
00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:39.744
but he's 77 years old.

274
00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:43.456
It's unusual enough to have
a priest stay overnight,

275
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:44.957
let alone this young man.

276
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.084
Again, my apologies mother.

277
00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:49.629
But he is a very pious
young man.

278
00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.048
And I assure you,

279
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:55.092
he is absolutely essential
for my work here.

280
00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:57.637
Then I assume
we should look at this

281
00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.847
as a test of faith
for all of us.

282
00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:04.769
Benjamin, mother superior
is concerned...

283
00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:07.063
How should I put this,

284
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.857
about having a young
unordained rooster

285
00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.484
loose in the hen house.

286
00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.319
Father, there's no need
to be crude.

287
00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.993
Mother superior, I'm taking
my vows later this year.

288
00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:24.372
I absolutely assure you, with
Christ himself as my witness,

289
00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:26.540
I will remain a model
of propriety

290
00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.709
as long as you are kind
enough to host me.

291
00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:35.049
Well, I'll expect so,
and we'll insist upon it.

292
00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:46.644
This is sister Ruth.
This is sister honey.

293
00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:48.944
- Thank you, mother.
- Father donaghue: Honey?

294
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.524
I... I believe it's proverbs.

295
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:55.611
"My son, eat the honey,
for it is good.

296
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.197
And the drippings
of the honeycomb

297
00:19:58.364 --> 00:19:59.824
are sweet to the taste."

298
00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.410
Oh, my god, stop.

299
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.620
Sister, that's enough.
Leave them be.

300
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.206
Have sister Mary
take their dirty things

301
00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:09.208
- when they're through.
- Yes, mother.

302
00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:15.631
And afterward, we should do
what we came here to do.

303
00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:17.591
The sooner, the better.

304
00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:20.052
Mother, forgive me,
one last thing.

305
00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:23.222
Do you happen to have any wine?

306
00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.225
"And they said of him,

307
00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:30.271
'he casts out devils
by the power of the devil."'

308
00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:31.939
careful, mother.

309
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.318
In that passage, the pharisees
are talking about our lord.

310
00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:38.112
Humph.

311
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.217
I thought you said
you were interested

312
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.451
in this going smoothly.

313
00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:46.537
We'll be in and out
of here anyway.

314
00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:50.499
The inflicted sister probably
just needs some priest

315
00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.918
to come and say the magic words.

316
00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:56.547
Don't worry. I've seen this
more than a few times.

317
00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:22.498
What?

318
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.158
It's father donaghue.

319
00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:28.287
It's not appropriate
for you to be here.

320
00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.664
But I imagine you knew that.

321
00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:32.082
Forgive me, mother.

322
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:35.085
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior.

323
00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:37.963
It was a long trip today.

324
00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:40.925
And I'm not accustomed
to your way of life out here.

325
00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:44.345
I wasn't thinking,
and I should've known better.

326
00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:45.638
You should have.

327
00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:49.141
I'm afraid I'm more used
to dealing with lay people.

328
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.686
Sometimes I joke with them.

329
00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:55.314
It puts them at ease.

330
00:21:56.565 --> 00:22:00.069
But here I should conduct
myself with more respect,

331
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.571
especially toward you.

332
00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:07.910
Well, then I must forgive you.

333
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:11.580
My temper is...

334
00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:14.792
It's been quite
a stressful time.

335
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.129
May the holy spirit
guide us both.

336
00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:26.095
Now, shall we go see
about your poor lost lamb?

337
00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:21.775
Has she spoken at all
in any ancient languages?

338
00:23:21.984 --> 00:23:23.861
- No, father.
- Has she said anything

339
00:23:23.986 --> 00:23:26.447
about any of you
she couldn't possibly know?

340
00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:29.074
Secrets or private details,

341
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:31.744
particularly those things
from before you took your vows?

342
00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:33.078
Of course not.

343
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.706
Likely all will be well.

344
00:23:36.832 --> 00:23:38.709
Follow my lead as we discussed.

345
00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:42.379
If you become afraid,
you can't let it show.

346
00:23:43.172 --> 00:23:46.175
You have to be strong,
but fill your hearts with love.

347
00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:50.763
If you see anything strange,
stick to the script.

348
00:23:54.558 --> 00:23:56.226
You tied her up?
You treat someone

349
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.990
like an animal,
they'll act like an animal.

350
00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:59.943
The poor girl injured herself.

351
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.941
Oh. What's her name?

352
00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:04.401
Agnes.
Sister Agnes.

353
00:24:05.194 --> 00:24:08.614
Sister Agnes, can you hear me?

354
00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:11.158
Can you feel me near you?

355
00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:17.665
This looks bad,
but maybe not that bad.

356
00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:20.250
Benjamin, the holy water.

357
00:24:32.763 --> 00:24:34.431
Well, let's begin.

358
00:24:38.852 --> 00:24:41.647
- Lord, have mercy.
- Lord, have mercy.

359
00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:43.899
Christ, have mercy.

360
00:24:44.274 --> 00:24:46.652
- Christ, have mercy.
- Fuck you.

361
00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:50.572
Lord, have mercy.

362
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:52.157
Lord, have mercy.

363
00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:53.909
Christ, have mercy.

364
00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:55.869
Christ, have mercy.

365
00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:58.163
Father donaghue: Begone, you.

366
00:24:59.081 --> 00:25:01.000
Begone, seducen

367
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:03.877
your place is in solitude.

368
00:25:04.712 --> 00:25:07.923
Your abode
is the nest of serpents.

369
00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:10.759
Get down and crawl with them.

370
00:25:11.969 --> 00:25:17.391
You might delude man,
but god cannot be mocked.

371
00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:19.601
Go to hell, cocksucker.

372
00:25:24.815 --> 00:25:27.317
It is he who cast you out,

373
00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:31.363
from whose sight
nothing is hidden.

374
00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:34.366
It is he who repels you,

375
00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:39.621
to whose might
all things are subject.

376
00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:42.708
Many things. Many things.

377
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.003
Is he who expels you.

378
00:25:46.837 --> 00:25:50.257
He who has everlasting fire.

379
00:26:00.142 --> 00:26:04.396
In the name of the father
and the son and the holy spirit.

380
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.689
Amen.

381
00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:13.530
Oh, dear sweet sister.

382
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:17.618
That was dramatic.

383
00:26:20.621 --> 00:26:21.622
It has to be.

384
00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:25.375
It's an exorcism,

385
00:26:27.002 --> 00:26:29.588
one of the most elaborate
song and dance acts

386
00:26:29.671 --> 00:26:31.006
the world has ever seen.

387
00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.633
So, that was all in her head?

388
00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:34.593
More or less.

389
00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:38.889
Look, the carmelites
here in Santa Teresa

390
00:26:38.972 --> 00:26:42.559
belong to an entirely
enclosed order.

391
00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:44.311
In some ways,

392
00:26:44.645 --> 00:26:46.396
they're more a relic
of the old church

393
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.315
than even exorcism itself.

394
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.660
- Yeah, but if they...
- That's enough heaven

395
00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:54.488
and hell for one night,
Benjamin, let's get some sleep.

396
00:26:55.656 --> 00:26:56.865
I'm knackered.

397
00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:10.754
God sees the truth...

398
00:27:12.381 --> 00:27:13.715
But waits.

399
00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:17.553
Over 100 years ago, Leo Tolstoy

400
00:27:18.011 --> 00:27:20.097
wrote a story with that title.

401
00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:23.058
And it has always stuck with me.

402
00:27:23.517 --> 00:27:27.855
I find that so many of us
who devote our lives to god

403
00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:29.314
through our vows,

404
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.193
spend a great deal
of time waiting.

405
00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:36.071
Waiting on god.

406
00:27:36.738 --> 00:27:38.740
It can be so easy

407
00:27:38.949 --> 00:27:43.954
to fall into despair
in this fallen world.

408
00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:48.417
How could we know this gift,

409
00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:51.461
the glory of salvation,

410
00:27:51.879 --> 00:27:55.132
of finding our way to Christ,

411
00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:59.219
if at first we did not wander?

412
00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:04.683
How could we ever
truly appreciate

413
00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:08.937
the miracle of redemption
and grace

414
00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:13.442
if we'd not suffered tribulation
and come to darkness?

415
00:28:14.818 --> 00:28:18.614
I haven't met all of you,
but the mother superior

416
00:28:18.906 --> 00:28:22.451
tells me that you are a pious
and devoted bunch.

417
00:28:23.076 --> 00:28:26.622
And I am truly grateful
for the hospitality

418
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:29.291
that you've shown us
during this time of trial,

419
00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:33.795
to me and my strapping
young buck of a companion.

420
00:28:33.879 --> 00:28:35.756
Isn't he handsome, ladies?

421
00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:38.258
But there is one among you

422
00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:42.346
who I am most pleased
to have become acquainted with,

423
00:28:43.347 --> 00:28:48.227
one who has suffered much,
walking through a darkness

424
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.396
that most of us
cannot even imagine,

425
00:28:52.356 --> 00:28:57.611
one who has endured
a true test of faith.

426
00:28:58.695 --> 00:29:01.531
God sees the truth, but waits.

427
00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:06.787
And he can always see a heart
that is fundamentally pure,

428
00:29:07.704 --> 00:29:10.499
as I know hers is.

429
00:29:11.792 --> 00:29:13.293
Okay, sister honey.

430
00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:37.526
What say you, dear sister,

431
00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:41.446
are you ready to join us
in the lord's sacrament?

432
00:29:46.201 --> 00:29:47.452
We must be patient.

433
00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:50.330
Understandably, our dear sister
will take some time

434
00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:52.040
to return to her former self.

435
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:56.169
Well, aren't you just
the sweetest old liar?

436
00:29:56.837 --> 00:29:58.171
What?

437
00:30:24.406 --> 00:30:27.075
Father frank,
he touched my wee-wee.

438
00:30:27.326 --> 00:30:30.579
Father frank,
he touched my wee-wee!

439
00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.010
So, should we call the diocese?

440
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.428
Absolutely not.

441
00:30:46.803 --> 00:30:48.930
- Well, the rite didn't work.
- You've made this worse

442
00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:50.766
- by your pride.
- Obviously,

443
00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:54.186
that was not my doing, mother.
It ambushed us.

444
00:30:54.478 --> 00:30:55.645
So, it's an it now?

445
00:30:56.646 --> 00:30:58.899
What she said about the child,
how could she know that?

446
00:30:59.358 --> 00:31:01.151
I thought everybody
knew about that.

447
00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:04.446
I have never seen anything
like this before in my life.

448
00:31:04.654 --> 00:31:06.656
I thought you were
supposed to be the expert.

449
00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:09.618
They were setting me up to fail.

450
00:31:10.202 --> 00:31:11.870
- Sister!
- I'm sorry, mother.

451
00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:13.997
We have to call the diocese.

452
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:18.251
You don't want that kind
of attention here right now.

453
00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:22.506
And it's not needed. I know
someone who can help us.

454
00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:25.592
- We served in Rome.
- You mean a priest?

455
00:31:27.636 --> 00:31:28.845
Kind of.

456
00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:35.644
Cross talk with guy Chesterton.

457
00:31:37.771 --> 00:31:39.356
No matter
your religious beliefs,

458
00:31:39.439 --> 00:31:41.483
you're probably familiar
with the old adage

459
00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:43.360
giving the devil his due.

460
00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:44.945
Well, our guest this evening

461
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.072
can be said to have done
all that and more,

462
00:31:47.406 --> 00:31:49.408
tracing an unlikely career path

463
00:31:49.491 --> 00:31:51.785
through decades
of macabre service,

464
00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:55.288
casting out alleged demons,
possibly saving souls,

465
00:31:55.372 --> 00:31:57.833
and becoming a household
name in the process.

466
00:31:58.333 --> 00:32:00.669
We're pleased to welcome
father Henry black

467
00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:02.671
in the studio with us
this evening.

468
00:32:03.839 --> 00:32:06.466
- Welcome, father black.
- Well, thank you, guy,

469
00:32:06.675 --> 00:32:09.177
that was quite an introduction.
It's good to be with you.

470
00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:11.388
Now, your methods are said
to be quite different

471
00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:12.764
from the catholic church,

472
00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:15.434
not to mention from the way
we've seen exorcism

473
00:32:15.517 --> 00:32:17.853
represented in the media
and on films.

474
00:32:18.562 --> 00:32:20.021
It's true
you were ex-communicated

475
00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:21.815
from the church
over 17 years ago.

476
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.733
Never looked back. Hmm.

477
00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:28.113
Now, I'm sure they miss me just
about as much as I miss them.

478
00:32:28.405 --> 00:32:29.865
Let's go back to the beginning.

479
00:32:30.115 --> 00:32:32.993
When did you learn you had
a talent for this kind of thing?

480
00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:34.870
When I was a child,

481
00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:39.416
my little sister was possessed
by a demon named bune.

482
00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:43.420
You were involved in exorcisms
from a very early age.

483
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.174
No, bune,
he was a stubborn demon.

484
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:49.718
He wouldn't get out.

485
00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:54.264
So, you're saying
a demon named bune

486
00:32:54.473 --> 00:32:57.267
infiltrated your sister's body
years ago,

487
00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.187
and to this day
resides in your family's home?

488
00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:02.689
- Correct.
- And all this can be verified?

489
00:33:02.772 --> 00:33:04.941
It took some getting used to.
But growing up,

490
00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:08.862
I was forced to adapt
to the ways of the demon bune.

491
00:33:09.863 --> 00:33:13.825
I grew accustomed to interacting
with him on a daily basis.

492
00:33:14.743 --> 00:33:16.536
So, by the time I got my collar,

493
00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:19.080
I already had all
the know-how I needed

494
00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:21.541
to exorcise anything
you put in front of me.

495
00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:23.752
And yet,
with all your experience,

496
00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:27.255
you were never able
to exercise the demon bune

497
00:33:27.422 --> 00:33:30.634
- from your sister.
- It's complicated, guy.

498
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:34.429
I mean, the family,
at this point,

499
00:33:34.513 --> 00:33:37.766
had become so familiar
with bune.

500
00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:41.353
He still lives with my family,
still eats at the table,

501
00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:44.856
still sleeps in what used
to be my sister's room,

502
00:33:45.565 --> 00:33:47.526
family vacations and whatnot.

503
00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:48.902
His favorite color is green.

504
00:33:48.985 --> 00:33:52.072
His favorite dessert
is lemon chiffon cake.

505
00:33:52.155 --> 00:33:54.074
What do you say
to those who claim

506
00:33:54.157 --> 00:33:57.285
you're simply exploiting
the families you visit

507
00:33:57.494 --> 00:33:59.913
and capitalizing
on the mental illness

508
00:33:59.996 --> 00:34:01.665
of the so-called possessed?

509
00:34:02.082 --> 00:34:05.252
Let me put it
to you this way, guy.

510
00:34:06.962 --> 00:34:08.880
I didn't choose
this line of work.

511
00:34:09.631 --> 00:34:10.715
It chose me.

512
00:34:11.508 --> 00:34:13.218
God chose me.

513
00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:18.640
He put me on a path of darkness.
He put a demon

514
00:34:18.974 --> 00:34:22.727
by my side and said,
"be not afraid, my son."

515
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:27.315
We'll be right back.

516
00:34:40.954 --> 00:34:42.956
She's given herself
over to the devil.

517
00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:44.457
She needs medical attention.

518
00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:47.335
Sisters, you forget yourselves.

519
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:49.087
As if we don't have
enough to do.

520
00:34:49.546 --> 00:34:51.590
Sister honey,
find out if father donaghue

521
00:34:51.673 --> 00:34:54.426
has stopped bleeding. If so,
clean and dress his wound.

522
00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:55.510
Yes, mother superior.

523
00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:57.637
You two,
finish cleaning the filth

524
00:34:57.721 --> 00:34:59.848
that Agnes has trailed
from the chapel. Go.

525
00:35:00.015 --> 00:35:01.808
You, prepare a light meal

526
00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:03.411
to be served to the rest
of the sisters

527
00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:05.645
in half an hour.
We will gather our strength,

528
00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:08.064
after which
we will retire to our rooms

529
00:35:08.189 --> 00:35:09.792
and we will pray
for the rest of the evening.

530
00:35:09.816 --> 00:35:11.776
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, mother.

531
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:16.239
Sister Mary, sister Ruth,
she's quiet, yes?

532
00:35:16.573 --> 00:35:19.367
She hasn't stirred since
the straps or the holy water.

533
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:21.910
Then go.

534
00:35:22.746 --> 00:35:23.830
Sister Mary,

535
00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:26.499
since you two
were thick as thieves,

536
00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:28.168
you will attend Agnes,

537
00:35:28.918 --> 00:35:30.462
or whatever holy remains in her.

538
00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:32.088
We might still call her
by that name.

539
00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:33.340
I can't see her.

540
00:35:36.676 --> 00:35:38.678
You're frightened, child?

541
00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.016
You don't have the luxury
to be frightened.

542
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.104
- Yes, mother.
- And mind,

543
00:35:49.773 --> 00:35:53.443
if she speaks evil,
don't listen.

544
00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:04.788
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The lord is with thee.

545
00:36:04.871 --> 00:36:06.265
Blessed art thou among women.

546
00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:08.009
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

547
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:09.727
Holy Mary, mother of
god, pray for us sinners

548
00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:11.271
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

549
00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:13.022
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The lord is with thee.

550
00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:14.214
Blessed art thou among women.

551
00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:15.900
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

552
00:36:15.924 --> 00:36:17.401
Holy Mary, mother of god,
pray for us sinners

553
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:18.968
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

554
00:36:19.094 --> 00:36:20.780
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The lord is with thee.

555
00:36:20.804 --> 00:36:22.281
Blessed art thou among women.
And blessed is the fruit

556
00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:23.449
- of thy womb, Jesus.
- Mary!

557
00:36:23.473 --> 00:36:25.034
- Holy Mary, mother of god...
- Go home!

558
00:36:25.058 --> 00:36:27.119
Pray for us sinners, now and
at the hour of our death, amen.

559
00:36:27.143 --> 00:36:28.978
- Hail Mary full of grace...
- Praise Jesus!

560
00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:31.123
Blessed is the fruit of thy...

561
00:36:31.147 --> 00:36:32.375
Holy Mary, mother of god,
pray for us

562
00:36:32.399 --> 00:36:33.983
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

563
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.069
Holy Mary, mother of god,
please pray for me.

564
00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.213
Hey, Mary.

565
00:36:58.842 --> 00:36:59.842
Hey, Agnes.

566
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.486
Are you afraid of me?

567
00:37:22.449 --> 00:37:24.242
You bit off
father donaghue's nose.

568
00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:27.746
Well, he had a nice nose.

569
00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:49.225
I wish I'd said goodbye
to everyone before I left,

570
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:52.896
told them how much I loved them.

571
00:37:56.357 --> 00:37:58.526
But I guess
that doesn't matter now.

572
00:38:02.822 --> 00:38:04.449
Aren't you uncomfortable?

573
00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.161
What do you mean?

574
00:38:09.621 --> 00:38:11.331
Come on, take that shit off.

575
00:38:35.104 --> 00:38:36.439
There, isn't that better?

576
00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:44.072
You and I have never
really been honest

577
00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:45.406
with each other, have we?

578
00:38:49.536 --> 00:38:50.662
You lost someone.

579
00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:55.458
- Yeah.
- I lost someone, too.

580
00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:58.086
The love of my life.

581
00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:01.005
He was my teacher.

582
00:39:03.216 --> 00:39:06.094
He could make me laugh
like no one else could.

583
00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:10.974
But I was stupid and I lost him.

584
00:39:13.434 --> 00:39:14.602
Paul satchimo.

585
00:39:17.647 --> 00:39:18.940
You loved him?

586
00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:21.442
And he loved me.

587
00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:25.363
You lost your son.

588
00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:29.868
The only person I ever loved.

589
00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:34.581
You have to Bury the dead, Mary.

590
00:39:52.265 --> 00:39:53.683
I'll always be with you.

591
00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:04.402
I beseech you
now for guidance, lord,

592
00:40:04.819 --> 00:40:06.779
you whose righteousness
has always breathed

593
00:40:06.863 --> 00:40:09.574
through this convent
like the sweetest song.

594
00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:12.619
How is this wretchedness
come to pass upon us?

595
00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:15.038
Is my service
not pleasing to you?

596
00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.456
What?

597
00:40:17.457 --> 00:40:19.542
- What's it?
- I'm sorry, mother.

598
00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:21.586
For a great many things,
I'm sure.

599
00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:22.962
I think you should go see Agnes.

600
00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:25.214
What are you talking about?
The devil is in her.

601
00:40:25.298 --> 00:40:26.758
Has it gotten into you as well?

602
00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:30.219
I don't think it's the devil.
She was kind to me.

603
00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:32.680
The devil leads with kindness.

604
00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:34.515
And why are you not presentable?

605
00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:37.268
There are men
in this house, you slut. Leave!

606
00:40:58.581 --> 00:41:00.249
Do you want me to pray with you?

607
00:41:01.209 --> 00:41:05.713
No, Benjamin, just
leave me to the wolves.

608
00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:12.220
Maybe a priest without a nose
won't seem so strange in...

609
00:41:13.596 --> 00:41:16.474
Vietnam or Croatia
or wherever the hell it is

610
00:41:16.557 --> 00:41:19.477
- they're gonna be sending me.
- That's it, think positive.

611
00:41:19.894 --> 00:41:23.773
I am thinking positive.
I'm positively fucked.

612
00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:28.861
Yeah.

613
00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:33.783
Father black
will be here in the morning.

614
00:41:35.868 --> 00:41:37.537
Well,
that should be interesting.

615
00:41:39.247 --> 00:41:40.873
I am fucked.

616
00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:46.713
I am fucked,
I'm fucked, I'm fucked.

617
00:42:27.253 --> 00:42:28.337
Frank.

618
00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:33.426
Good to see you again.

619
00:42:33.718 --> 00:42:34.862
So what happened there, frank,

620
00:42:34.886 --> 00:42:36.387
somebody spite your face
a little bit?

621
00:42:36.512 --> 00:42:39.015
Yeah, something like that.
Father black,

622
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.434
I would like to introduce you
to Benjamin,

623
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:43.186
one of my best students.

624
00:42:44.062 --> 00:42:47.148
Father Henry black
and his lovely assistant.

625
00:42:47.315 --> 00:42:48.900
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

626
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:51.527
- I didn't disclose.
- Right.

627
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:53.529
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

628
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.239
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

629
00:42:57.075 --> 00:42:58.576
- Who's this guy?
- I'm sorry.

630
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:00.453
We've been under
considerable stress

631
00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:01.746
in our current predicament.

632
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:04.069
- Benjamin, if you...
- The boy's right.

633
00:43:05.708 --> 00:43:08.836
This is not the sort of company
I'd ever allow in this convent,

634
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.254
no matter what the circumstance.

635
00:43:10.338 --> 00:43:12.215
You absolutely
cannot smoke here.

636
00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:17.136
You know, I can sense
when I'm not welcome, frank.

637
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.721
I appreciate the call

638
00:43:18.805 --> 00:43:20.282
- after so long, but...
- No, no, no, no.

639
00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:22.026
- Come on, let's...
- Please, Henry, please.

640
00:43:22.308 --> 00:43:27.105
The fact is that we are
in dire need of your expertise.

641
00:43:27.355 --> 00:43:28.773
That's probably true.

642
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:35.363
Mother, you and the sisters
in your cherished convent

643
00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:37.532
have been the most
gracious hosts.

644
00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:39.033
But now I have a request.

645
00:43:39.367 --> 00:43:41.202
Respectfully,
would you give it a rest?

646
00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:43.663
- Excuse me?
- Forgive us, mother.

647
00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:46.374
- This is highly inappropriate.
- At this juncture,

648
00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.793
I don't see that you
have any other choice.

649
00:43:49.085 --> 00:43:52.380
Please escort us to Agnes

650
00:43:52.713 --> 00:43:55.466
so that we can end
this dance once and for all.

651
00:43:55.591 --> 00:43:56.884
I most certainly will not.

652
00:43:57.093 --> 00:44:00.471
Very well, then.
If you will follow me,

653
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.099
I would love to introduce you
to the poor girl,

654
00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:05.518
and you can commence your work.

655
00:44:07.937 --> 00:44:10.523
Oh, what the hell?
I drove this far.

656
00:44:13.734 --> 00:44:16.070
I'll be notifying the bishop.

657
00:44:21.159 --> 00:44:22.285
I am curious.

658
00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:31.085
Hello there, Agnes.

659
00:44:35.047 --> 00:44:37.091
Wow, shows some good instinct

660
00:44:38.426 --> 00:44:40.720
because I'm not your friend.

661
00:44:41.929 --> 00:44:44.140
I'm not your friend at all.
No, ma'am.

662
00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:48.269
Let me ask you something.

663
00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:51.772
Do you feel like
you're welcome here?

664
00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:53.983
Is that what's going on?

665
00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:58.738
You feel like you're welcome?
Because I've looked around.

666
00:45:00.114 --> 00:45:01.365
You're in a convent.

667
00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:05.036
So... so, you're not
welcome here.

668
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:08.623
Which means that you and I,
well, we're gonna have to...

669
00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:11.125
Have this little talk,
aren't we?

670
00:45:12.251 --> 00:45:13.794
You're a disgrace.

671
00:45:14.086 --> 00:45:16.380
Well, you can sweet
talk me all you want,

672
00:45:16.464 --> 00:45:18.132
but I'm not scared.

673
00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:19.842
Fuck you, cocksucker.

674
00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:23.387
Oh! Yeah, you can't bruise name
with your words, either.

675
00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:25.431
I've been to all nine
levels of hell and back.

676
00:45:25.514 --> 00:45:26.891
I wouldn't have you.

677
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.311
Well, you see, that's...
That's where you're wrong

678
00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:34.649
because I have escorted
several there myself.

679
00:45:45.284 --> 00:45:47.161
I think
I'm starting to like you.

680
00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:49.789
Well that's, that's sweet.

681
00:45:51.374 --> 00:45:52.833
Let me tell you something.

682
00:45:53.125 --> 00:45:54.752
Come here,
let me tell you something.

683
00:45:56.254 --> 00:45:59.257
I love you.

684
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.343
You love me?

685
00:46:02.843 --> 00:46:05.388
I do. I love you.

686
00:46:07.098 --> 00:46:08.808
And you know who else loves you?

687
00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:10.643
No.

688
00:46:11.852 --> 00:46:14.939
- Jesus Christ! Get out, demon!
- Stop, no! No!

689
00:46:15.022 --> 00:46:17.483
- It's time for you to go! You hear me?
- No, stop, please!

690
00:46:17.566 --> 00:46:19.169
- The power of Jesus Christ...
- I'm sorry!

691
00:46:19.193 --> 00:46:20.945
- Our true lord and savior...
- No, no!

692
00:46:21.028 --> 00:46:22.280
- Compels you!
- No! No!

693
00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:23.948
- And I say begone!
- I'm so sorry!

694
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.576
- Begone!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

695
00:46:27.743 --> 00:46:29.620
- This has to stop now!
- Just wait!

696
00:46:29.745 --> 00:46:34.041
Child of god, for it
is he who commands you!

697
00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:37.795
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

698
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.797
What just happened?
What just happened?

699
00:46:40.006 --> 00:46:43.259
It's all right, my child.
You're safe now.

700
00:46:43.592 --> 00:46:48.097
I don't understand, I...
I could... I could see, like,

701
00:46:49.348 --> 00:46:50.683
I could feel.

702
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.770
It was like, it was like
I was another person.

703
00:46:54.854 --> 00:46:56.314
Yeah, well, you were,

704
00:46:56.522 --> 00:46:59.817
you were in the grips
of a creature most foul.

705
00:47:01.027 --> 00:47:02.611
But it's okay, you're safe now.

706
00:47:03.279 --> 00:47:04.447
You see, folks,

707
00:47:05.448 --> 00:47:07.616
that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

708
00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:11.662
You see, if you'd have let me
have my camera crew in here,

709
00:47:11.746 --> 00:47:13.789
we could've documented
some history.

710
00:47:13.873 --> 00:47:16.584
- Nice work, Henry.
- Thank you, frank.

711
00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:18.794
Father black, thank you.

712
00:47:19.045 --> 00:47:21.339
No, there's no need to thank me.

713
00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:23.382
No, I want to thank you.

714
00:47:23.466 --> 00:47:25.509
But I have to tell you,
I'm afraid.

715
00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:28.054
Well, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

716
00:47:29.138 --> 00:47:30.681
Maybe not for me.

717
00:47:31.432 --> 00:47:35.186
- Well, what do you mean?
- It's not me I'm afraid for.

718
00:47:37.313 --> 00:47:39.440
I don't understand.

719
00:47:41.817 --> 00:47:42.818
It's you.

720
00:47:47.615 --> 00:47:51.327
Oh, goddammit, son of a bitch!

721
00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:54.580
Please, praise me! God!

722
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.916
Please, please! God!

723
00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:58.501
Somebody help me!

724
00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:00.044
Aren't you going
to do something?

725
00:48:00.252 --> 00:48:03.214
Help!

726
00:48:09.178 --> 00:48:11.459
God damn you!

727
00:49:35.347 --> 00:49:36.557
Yeah, we're good.

728
00:49:37.475 --> 00:49:39.643
Hey, Wanda, do you know
if our paychecks are ready?

729
00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:42.563
Oh, I don't know. Go ask curly.
He's in the back.

730
00:49:44.064 --> 00:49:45.544
- How are you doing?
- All right.

731
00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:47.610
Good.

732
00:49:47.776 --> 00:49:48.861
Come.

733
00:49:53.949 --> 00:49:56.410
Hey, I was wondering if
my paycheck was ready yet?

734
00:49:56.494 --> 00:49:57.870
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

735
00:49:59.205 --> 00:50:02.249
You're...
You're that new girl, huh?

736
00:50:03.459 --> 00:50:04.978
What was your...
What was your name again?

737
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:07.122
- I'm terrible with that stuff.
- It's okay. Uh, Mary.

738
00:50:07.213 --> 00:50:09.256
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.

739
00:50:10.424 --> 00:50:12.134
Mary Jane, Mary Jane.

740
00:50:13.802 --> 00:50:15.262
There we go, I got you.

741
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:18.182
All right, here, there you go.

742
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:19.767
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

743
00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.644
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You just call me...

744
00:50:22.561 --> 00:50:24.355
Call me curly, all right?

745
00:50:25.105 --> 00:50:26.190
Today your day off?

746
00:50:26.565 --> 00:50:28.442
Yeah, I'm working
a double tomorrow.

747
00:50:28.651 --> 00:50:30.903
Oh, nice.
Well, you enjoy your day.

748
00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:33.948
Yeah, you too.

749
00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:35.282
Used to be a nun, huh?

750
00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:39.203
- Yeah, I was.
- Golly.

751
00:50:40.955 --> 00:50:42.706
I've always wanted
to meet a nun.

752
00:50:43.499 --> 00:50:45.668
Well, I'm sure I've met
enough for the both of us.

753
00:50:49.964 --> 00:50:52.800
I bet you have.
I bet you have. That's good.

754
00:50:53.467 --> 00:50:54.468
That's good.

755
00:50:56.011 --> 00:50:57.447
Hey, listen,
I'll be the first tell you

756
00:50:57.471 --> 00:50:59.783
that I don't really go for
fraternizing with the employees here,

757
00:50:59.807 --> 00:51:01.141
but since you're new in town,

758
00:51:01.225 --> 00:51:03.227
if you ever wanted to, you know.

759
00:51:05.312 --> 00:51:07.439
I'm out and about a lot.

760
00:51:07.773 --> 00:51:11.485
I don't know if you like
to drink or if you like wine.

761
00:51:13.529 --> 00:51:14.947
I like wine.

762
00:51:17.783 --> 00:51:19.618
I like...
I like other stuff, too.

763
00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:26.959
So... when was the last time
you went out with somebody?

764
00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:29.461
I don't know.

765
00:51:30.504 --> 00:51:32.047
I guess you got
all kinds of stuff

766
00:51:32.131 --> 00:51:34.049
just stirring up inside you.

767
00:51:38.721 --> 00:51:40.347
Yeah, well,
you just think about it.

768
00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:42.016
You know where to find me.

769
00:51:43.976 --> 00:51:46.437
Hey, enjoy your day off.

770
00:51:46.895 --> 00:51:47.980
Thank you.

771
00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.962
Later, girl.

772
00:52:18.344 --> 00:52:20.220
Now, take care.
Thank you so much.

773
00:52:20.846 --> 00:52:22.514
Hi, how can I help you?

774
00:52:22.598 --> 00:52:24.099
I just need to cash this check.

775
00:52:24.183 --> 00:52:26.393
Teller: Sure. You have
a checking account with us?

776
00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:28.270
I don't. Do I need one?

777
00:52:28.354 --> 00:52:30.522
Yes. In order to cash
your check, you do. Yeah.

778
00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:32.107
Okay.
Does it cost anything?

779
00:52:32.191 --> 00:52:34.943
It's $25,
but we have great benefits.

780
00:52:36.737 --> 00:52:38.822
- Twenty-five?
- Cashier: Twenty-five, yes.

781
00:52:44.578 --> 00:52:45.954
You have a good day.

782
00:52:49.958 --> 00:52:52.169
Wolt seems
I remember doing this before,

783
00:52:52.753 --> 00:52:54.755
only then
I didn't have so far to fall.

784
00:52:59.885 --> 00:53:01.485
Where are you now, Martin?

785
00:53:49.935 --> 00:53:52.479
He brought by his dog
thinking I would babysit.

786
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:55.441
I mean,
now what kind of lazy sob

787
00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:57.818
would think that I would
take care of his dog?

788
00:53:58.152 --> 00:54:00.070
Just crazy son of a...

789
00:54:00.696 --> 00:54:02.823
There you go.
You have a good day.

790
00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:07.244
I sure like that tie and
that pink shirt. Looks good.

791
00:54:08.454 --> 00:54:10.164
Oh. Hey, Mary,

792
00:54:10.414 --> 00:54:12.499
- could you do me a favor?
- What?

793
00:54:12.833 --> 00:54:16.503
Curly's yapping about
some spill on aisle four.

794
00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:18.464
Would you clean it up for me?

795
00:54:19.131 --> 00:54:22.050
Please? I mean,
my back is just killing me.

796
00:54:22.718 --> 00:54:24.178
I've been standing here

797
00:54:24.386 --> 00:54:27.890
- for four hours.
- Okay, fine. Fine.

798
00:54:28.557 --> 00:54:30.267
I'll watch your register.

799
00:54:33.604 --> 00:54:35.731
What the fuck
are you talking about?

800
00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:37.566
This is not the plan, all right?

801
00:54:37.733 --> 00:54:39.401
He was drunk
off the booze you made.

802
00:54:39.485 --> 00:54:40.819
- Okay?
- Oh, so it's my fault?

803
00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.104
- WoYes.
- Listen,

804
00:54:42.196 --> 00:54:43.530
I have bills to pay.

805
00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:45.032
You have a bill to pay.

806
00:54:48.535 --> 00:54:50.913
He fucking gets drunk and
takes advantage of you?

807
00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:52.039
WoGo to hell, curly.

808
00:55:01.089 --> 00:55:02.299
How are you doing today,

809
00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:04.259
- sister Mary?
- I'm good.

810
00:55:04.885 --> 00:55:07.221
I just got off work and I'm
gonna go meet some friends.

811
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:10.265
Please, if you want anything,
just help yourself.

812
00:55:10.432 --> 00:55:12.810
Well, I ain't gonna trouble
you none. I just...

813
00:55:13.018 --> 00:55:14.478
I just need a moment
of your time,

814
00:55:14.603 --> 00:55:17.815
if that's okay with you.
You got a little bit of time?

815
00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:19.983
Yeah. Is everything okay?

816
00:55:20.192 --> 00:55:22.152
Nah, nothing like that.

817
00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:27.658
You being a nun and all, when
you came looking for a place,

818
00:55:27.783 --> 00:55:31.078
well, you know,
I gave you a special deal.

819
00:55:31.245 --> 00:55:33.372
And I appreciate it a lot.
I really do.

820
00:55:33.455 --> 00:55:34.665
Ah, it was nothing.

821
00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:37.084
It feels good to help, it does.

822
00:55:37.751 --> 00:55:40.671
But well, my wife, ona,

823
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.632
she gets bent
out of shape a lot.

824
00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:45.934
But you gotta understand,
she's a juice head.

825
00:55:45.968 --> 00:55:48.220
Been that way for as
long as I can remember.

826
00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:51.265
And when she caught wind
of me helping out

827
00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:54.184
another young woman and...
Well, she got ideas.

828
00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.271
- Is there something that...
- Hold on now.

829
00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.439
I done told her wasn't
nothing going on between us,

830
00:55:59.606 --> 00:56:01.275
but that don't mean
she listened.

831
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:04.862
See, we have a history
that stretches far and wide

832
00:56:04.945 --> 00:56:06.071
across this city.

833
00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:08.490
And I done quit drinking,
understand,

834
00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:09.825
I don't touch this stuff.

835
00:56:10.868 --> 00:56:14.246
This ain't my doing, but anyhow,

836
00:56:14.454 --> 00:56:17.374
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to break our promise.

837
00:56:17.666 --> 00:56:20.794
I know I told you
I needed 450 for this place.

838
00:56:21.336 --> 00:56:23.755
But in order to be fair
to the other tenants,

839
00:56:23.881 --> 00:56:26.884
be fair to ona, I'm going
to have to ask for 600.

840
00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:28.635
Six hundred dollars?

841
00:56:29.511 --> 00:56:30.846
I'm real sorry.

842
00:56:31.513 --> 00:56:35.183
It ain't like me to promise one
thing and then take it back.

843
00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:39.146
Right. It's just $600
is a lot of money.

844
00:56:39.313 --> 00:56:40.772
My job doesn't pay very much.

845
00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:43.567
It's tough all over,
sister Mary.

846
00:56:46.278 --> 00:56:47.463
I'm gonna give you the number

847
00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:50.157
of another young woman
named evonne.

848
00:56:50.324 --> 00:56:53.619
She works up at the laundromat.
She's always looking for help.

849
00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:56.496
It ain't much,
but maybe it'll help you

850
00:56:57.497 --> 00:56:59.416
get over the hump,
won't put you out much.

851
00:57:00.792 --> 00:57:02.127
The work's easy.

852
00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:51.134
- Hello, sisters.
- Sister Mary. Aww!

853
00:57:51.677 --> 00:57:53.095
You look wonderful.

854
00:57:53.178 --> 00:57:55.430
We just wanted
to see how you were doing.

855
00:57:55.806 --> 00:57:57.140
I'm fine.

856
00:57:58.141 --> 00:57:59.309
But how are you?

857
00:58:01.144 --> 00:58:02.229
Good.

858
00:58:05.107 --> 00:58:07.567
So, you are living in this town?

859
00:58:08.735 --> 00:58:11.738
Yeah, I got an apartment
near here not long ago.

860
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.448
What a coincidence.

861
00:58:13.573 --> 00:58:16.618
We're only a few stops up
the bus line at villa Lucia.

862
00:58:16.868 --> 00:58:18.870
It must be part of god's plan.

863
00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:21.039
- Do you like it?
- Oh, yes.

864
00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:25.168
But it's very different
than Santa Teresa.

865
00:58:25.877 --> 00:58:28.088
- It's a convent in the city.
- Can you imagine?

866
00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:31.216
After sister Agnes was put away

867
00:58:31.299 --> 00:58:33.677
and mother superior
laid to rest...

868
00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:38.348
The diocese thought it
best to relocate all of us.

869
00:58:38.432 --> 00:58:41.893
And the new order
is very different.

870
00:58:42.602 --> 00:58:45.022
So, what have you been up to?

871
00:58:46.023 --> 00:58:47.274
Well, I got a job.

872
00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:48.984
You're so brave.

873
00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:51.361
I always said that
you were the brave one.

874
00:58:51.445 --> 00:58:54.406
Didn't I always say that about
sister Mary, sister Ruth?

875
00:58:54.489 --> 00:58:57.409
Yes, she always
did say that about you.

876
00:58:58.035 --> 00:59:01.079
And also that
you were pure of heart.

877
00:59:01.163 --> 00:59:03.874
I did. I did. I did.

878
00:59:04.499 --> 00:59:06.543
We understand better than anyone

879
00:59:06.793 --> 00:59:09.755
how difficult it must've been
for you to leave the convent

880
00:59:09.838 --> 00:59:11.048
the way that you did.

881
00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.317
And we want you to know
we have your best interest

882
00:59:13.341 --> 00:59:15.844
at heart, but we feel that...

883
00:59:16.011 --> 00:59:19.598
Listen, we understand,
we really do.

884
00:59:20.307 --> 00:59:24.144
What happened was
traumatizing, to say the least.

885
00:59:24.936 --> 00:59:27.206
We want you to know
we have your best interest

886
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.583
- at heart.
- Traumatizing

887
00:59:28.607 --> 00:59:30.358
for everybody. Traumatizing.

888
00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:34.321
The church not only
lost Santa Theresa,

889
00:59:34.488 --> 00:59:38.075
I heard it was sold last month,
but father donaghue as well.

890
00:59:38.158 --> 00:59:39.826
That brave and gentle man.

891
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:42.030
- What happened to him?
- He disappeared.

892
00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:44.247
No one has seen him since.

893
00:59:45.082 --> 00:59:47.167
We know that
it's been a lot to deal with,

894
00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:48.877
and we respect your choice.

895
00:59:49.377 --> 00:59:52.297
But we would also like
to extend our welcome

896
00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.716
if you wanted to join us
at villa Lucia.

897
00:59:56.593 --> 01:00:01.306
Sister honey, sister Ruth,
I appreciate you reaching out,

898
01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:04.935
but after all
we've been through,

899
01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:08.605
it just felt right
to put everything behind me.

900
01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.440
We understand that.

901
01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:14.945
But may I ask you
a question, Mary?

902
01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:17.948
- Is it about Agnes?
- No.

903
01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:21.952
Do you still carry the faith?

904
01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:28.250
I don't know.

905
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.796
I keep a crucifix
on the wall in my apartment

906
01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:34.589
and I pray sometimes,

907
01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:37.342
but I don't know what
it all means anymore.

908
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:40.887
I mean, now that I'm
back in the real world,

909
01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:44.099
my time at the convent
feels like a dream.

910
01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:48.562
I keep asking for god
to guide me and...

911
01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.274
I hear nothing back.

912
01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:00.782
Did you know
among our other duties

913
01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:03.702
in the new order,
we service the poor.

914
01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:06.663
Yes, our soup lines
are very popular.

915
01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.630
Hey, I got this.

916
01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:20.468
Thanks. I'm gonna go clock out.

917
01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.930
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

918
01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:34.482
Hey, whoa.

919
01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:37.319
Who's taking over your shift?

920
01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:39.237
It's Wanda. She's out there now.

921
01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:41.907
Can't be Wanda.
I done fired Wanda.

922
01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:44.409
- No, I didn't know.
- Yeah, well,

923
01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.077
there's a lot
you don't know about.

924
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.372
Especially what
goes on back here.

925
01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:50.790
I don't know.

926
01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:53.251
I noticed you've been picking up
a lot of double shifts.

927
01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:57.339
You're a worker.
Not like these other girls that,

928
01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.634
they don't care
about getting ahead.

929
01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:03.678
- My rentjust went up.
- Yeah, I know

930
01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.055
your rent just went up.

931
01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:06.556
And I get it. I get it.

932
01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:09.517
We all got stuff like that
in our lives.

933
01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.978
Let me ask you something.
This job,

934
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.398
all the double shifts,
the back—to-backs,

935
01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:18.610
is it gonna be enough?

936
01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:21.529
We'll see.

937
01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:23.406
Yeah, we'll see.

938
01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:25.575
How about this?

939
01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:30.497
How about I give you
a little extra cash.

940
01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.125
Then when I need a favor,

941
01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:37.545
- I can call on you.
- No, thank you.

942
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:40.840
"No, thank you"?

943
01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:43.093
I appreciate it.
But I can't take that.

944
01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.263
My money's not good
enough for you?

945
01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.848
I'd just like to make it
my own way.

946
01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:55.063
Yeah, I can respect that.

947
01:02:58.149 --> 01:02:59.734
I'm going to get you
one of these days.

948
01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:03.488
I better go back up front.

949
01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:05.073
Yeah, go on.

950
01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:20.130
Evonne:
So, you're Earl's friend?

951
01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:21.840
Yeah.

952
01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:24.134
I'm his tenant.

953
01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:25.927
Mm-hmm.

954
01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:28.221
He's really nice.

955
01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:30.640
Oh, I'll bet he is.

956
01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:55.725
Lady, if you don't know
the difference between

957
01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:58.126
a meatball and a matzo ball,
I cannot help you.

958
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:01.838
Anyway, please give it
up for my good friend,

959
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:04.382
the great Paul satchimo,
ladies and gentlemen.

960
01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:06.259
Paul satchimo.

961
01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:10.638
Hey, everybody.

962
01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.140
You know what I've noticed?

963
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.727
Not everybody's trying.
You ever notice that?

964
01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:20.023
Okay, I saw a guy
on the sidewalk yesterday,

965
01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:22.108
he was pushing a shopping cart
full of newspapers,

966
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:24.027
wearing pink stretch pants.

967
01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:26.863
He was trying.

968
01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:28.823
He went to the bank
to get a loan.

969
01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:31.493
They weren't trying at all.

970
01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.413
I went to this bar back here
to cash in my two drink limit,

971
01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:37.707
and, man..
They weren't trying either.

972
01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:42.420
So, now here I am,
up here trying, dead sober.

973
01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:45.173
Okay. Check this out.

974
01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.093
Some people are trying,
some people aren't trying.

975
01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:50.512
Some people
aren't even trying to try.

976
01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:54.057
But some people
are trying to not try.

977
01:04:55.433 --> 01:05:01.106
And some people are trying
to try not trying.

978
01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.193
Hey, if I thought that
could work, I might try it.

979
01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:10.990
Anyway, what do you
guys want to talk about?

980
01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:12.951
Money?

981
01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:15.744
Jobs?

982
01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:20.166
I had a regular type
job once, I did.

983
01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:24.003
I was a cold caller

984
01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:28.258
selling restaurant quality
meats at wholesale prices.

985
01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:30.009
I was not very good at it.

986
01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:33.471
One night...

987
01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:36.224
Yes, one night...

988
01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:39.894
Victory.

989
01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:44.691
I sold 25 pounds
of New York strips

990
01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:47.694
all across the greater
metropolitan area.

991
01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:50.947
My name topped the sales board.

992
01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:55.034
I Rose from my cubicle
like a champion

993
01:05:55.994 --> 01:06:00.540
as my colleagues watched
with... with, um...

994
01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:02.625
With envy,

995
01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:04.794
and disdain because they knew...

996
01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:06.504
That I had been chosen

997
01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:09.048
by the team leader, Mark,

998
01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:13.219
to enter the inner sanctum,

999
01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:14.971
the deep freeze,

1000
01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:19.142
the deep freeze
which held a cornucopia

1001
01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.562
of frozen meat products.

1002
01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:24.689
And as I stood there,

1003
01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:27.275
gazing into the...

1004
01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:30.862
The glistening vista
of frozen meats,

1005
01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:35.825
Mark said to me and I quote,
"pick anything you want."

1006
01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.457
Anyway, that's it.
That's the story.

1007
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.084
It's not really a joke, I guess.

1008
01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:50.048
It's really more
just a 38-year-old man

1009
01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:53.051
sitting alone in his apartment,
eating three pounds of sausage.

1010
01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.308
You know what, that sausage
didn't make me happy.

1011
01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:04.020
Things, things do not
make people happy.

1012
01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.524
Do you know what does make
people happy? Do you know?

1013
01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:10.151
Connection.

1014
01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:16.908
Us, connecting in this room,
right now.

1015
01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.952
Forget about the sausage.

1016
01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:20.787
It's an electricity.
Do you feel it?

1017
01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:22.765
- Right now, it's happening.
- Father donaghue: It's us.

1018
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:24.374
We 're communicating
with one another.

1019
01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.435
That's where real happiness
comes from. I don't know.

1020
01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.545
Anyway, what else you
guys want to talk about?

1021
01:07:53.111 --> 01:07:54.988
Frozen meats.

1022
01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.164
Hey, hey, hey.

1023
01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:07.458
What is so funny?
People are complaining.

1024
01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:14.132
That's what I thought.

1025
01:08:14.382 --> 01:08:16.259
Would you calm the fuck down?

1026
01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:19.220
I'm sorry.

1027
01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:22.098
Jesus Christ.

1028
01:08:35.445 --> 01:08:37.947
It can't compare
to the nonsense,

1029
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.407
she started saying things.

1030
01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:51.544
And concentrate
on the things you can handle.

1031
01:08:52.378 --> 01:08:54.547
Sometimes,
I gotta pray for strength.

1032
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.674
Like the good book says,

1033
01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:59.052
"like a dog
returneth to its vomit,

1034
01:08:59.177 --> 01:09:01.220
so a fool repeats
his foolishness."

1035
01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:04.098
Mary, are you even
listening to me?

1036
01:09:10.271 --> 01:09:12.690
Hi. Do you need any help?

1037
01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:16.277
Um, no, I don't think so.
I just came in here to...

1038
01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:19.322
Wait, what do people
come in here to do?

1039
01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:22.367
Um, I can show
you how the machines work.

1040
01:09:24.369 --> 01:09:26.621
I think I got it, but thank you.

1041
01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.373
No problem.

1042
01:09:33.544 --> 01:09:34.754
Okay, well.

1043
01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.006
Yeah, just let me know
if you need anything.

1044
01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:38.090
Sure.

1045
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:48.768
- Who's that?
- He's a comedian.

1046
01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.771
He don't look funny.
Is he funny?

1047
01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:54.190
Yes. He's a comedian.

1048
01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.086
Oh, hey.

1049
01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:19.465
Am I not allowed
to smoke out here?

1050
01:10:19.757 --> 01:10:20.800
It's fine.

1051
01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.386
Cool. You never know these days.

1052
01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:26.931
I saw your show.

1053
01:10:28.516 --> 01:10:31.519
Oh, okay. Well, no wonder.

1054
01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:34.147
Well, thanks for coming.

1055
01:10:41.863 --> 01:10:43.114
So, what did you think?

1056
01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.032
Of the show?

1057
01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:46.701
Yeah. Did you laugh?

1058
01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:48.535
Huh!

1059
01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:52.206
Everyone's a critic.

1060
01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:54.917
It wasn't my best night.

1061
01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:58.671
But I laughed later.

1062
01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.883
Well, I guess that's something,

1063
01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:04.427
the slow burn kind of a thing.

1064
01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:11.184
Of course, the point is
to laugh during the show.

1065
01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:14.103
That's kind of the idea,
I guess.

1066
01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:17.148
Hell, I dunno. You know what?

1067
01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:20.109
Laugh when you wanna laugh.
It's a free country.

1068
01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:23.988
I knew Agnes.

1069
01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:28.117
Excuse me?

1070
01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:31.829
I was in the convent
with Agnes before she left.

1071
01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:35.208
Oh.

1072
01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:37.710
Wow.

1073
01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:40.004
She was in love with you.

1074
01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:06.239
You look nice.

1075
01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:15.122
I have to say I haven't
even heard her name in...

1076
01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:17.959
I don't know, it's been awhile.

1077
01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.044
You must've known her
pretty well.

1078
01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:22.755
We had talks.

1079
01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.508
Not a lot, but the ones we had
were important.

1080
01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:27.969
She was incredible.

1081
01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:30.638
And do you know
where she is now?

1082
01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:33.182
You mentioned
she left the convent.

1083
01:12:34.809 --> 01:12:37.061
She's in a different place now.

1084
01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.313
What do you mean?

1085
01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.149
I don't want to talk about it.

1086
01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:44.735
I understand.

1087
01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:48.906
I always wondered about her,
to be honest.

1088
01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:53.744
The minute that things
got hard between us

1089
01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.455
was the minute she gave up.
And I never bought into any

1090
01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:58.059
of her religious horseshit,
by the way.

1091
01:12:58.416 --> 01:13:01.377
I'm sorry if! Offend, but I...

1092
01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:05.923
I couldn't understand why she
went to such great lengths

1093
01:13:06.007 --> 01:13:08.342
for her salvation.

1094
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:10.928
Anyway, we were young.

1095
01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:15.641
I... I didn't usually make
a habit of dating my students,

1096
01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:18.853
but I, you know, in that case
I made an exception.

1097
01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.607
How long have you
been a funny man?

1098
01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:26.694
A what?

1099
01:13:28.779 --> 01:13:31.324
I guess, I don't know,
I've always been funny.

1100
01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:35.036
I, uh, I was funny
when I was a kid,

1101
01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:38.831
started putting an act
together when I was like 19,

1102
01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:42.835
and I should probably be
farther along in my career

1103
01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:44.712
than I am, but...

1104
01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:48.549
But you're comfortable?
You like who you are?

1105
01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:50.927
Yeah, I think so.

1106
01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:54.138
I... I makejust
the right amount of money

1107
01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:59.185
and I... I'm happy
living life the way that I do.

1108
01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:00.478
I don't,

1109
01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:05.149
I don't need fame or fortune.
I do what I love.

1110
01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:08.361
How about you?
What's your story?

1111
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:11.238
Why did you leave the convent?

1112
01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:14.450
That was Agnes, really.

1113
01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:17.703
She convinced me there
was maybe more to life

1114
01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:18.787
outside the church.

1115
01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:22.249
So, what do you think?

1116
01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:26.087
I don't think either of us
ever belonged there.

1117
01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:30.730
Is there anything
you're passionate about?

1118
01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:32.301
Anything at all?

1119
01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.013
I don't know.

1120
01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:39.767
The only thing I ever worked
hard for was becoming a sister.

1121
01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:45.564
Well, geez, Mary, that's about
the saddest thing I ever heard.

1122
01:14:48.275 --> 01:14:49.986
Can I ask you
a personal question?

1123
01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.698
Have you ever felt love
outside of god?

1124
01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:05.251
Hey, Paul, don't mind us.
We just been here a few hours.

1125
01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:07.308
Are you gonna introduce
us to your friend?

1126
01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:11.549
Oh, sorry. Peter, Evelyn, Pedro.
This is Mary.

1127
01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:13.192
Nice to meet you.
He's the best.

1128
01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:14.468
I always say he's the best.

1129
01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:32.820
Anyway, here we are.

1130
01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:40.077
You can feel free
to make yourself at home.

1131
01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:46.709
I don't know, have a seat
or whatever you do.

1132
01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:49.754
I'll be right back.

1133
01:15:57.762 --> 01:15:59.096
I like your place.

1134
01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:00.890
Thank you.

1135
01:16:07.605 --> 01:16:09.315
You were the funniest man?

1136
01:16:09.982 --> 01:16:12.693
- Like in the world?
- What's that?

1137
01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:16.697
Oh, that? Yeah.
That was many years ago.

1138
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:19.533
Who's the funniest man now?

1139
01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:23.287
Um...

1140
01:16:24.622 --> 01:16:25.831
I actually don't know.

1141
01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:28.918
Do you like music?

1142
01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:30.711
I used to.

1143
01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:33.255
Okay.

1144
01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:39.386
You read a lot. Books.

1145
01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:43.057
Oh, yeah. Well, as I said,
I used to teach.

1146
01:16:43.974 --> 01:16:45.476
There was a time...

1147
01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:48.771
I can't say that I really
have the focus to just...

1148
01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:53.526
To just sit and read a book.
I haven't for a while.

1149
01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:55.069
I don't know
what happened there.

1150
01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.947
What do you do now?

1151
01:16:58.322 --> 01:17:00.658
You mean to take
the place of reading?

1152
01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:03.119
Um...

1153
01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:06.956
I don't know. I guess I drink.

1154
01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:16.382
I have to say, I don't know why
I'm being so honest with you.

1155
01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:19.260
I know that we just met,
and I...

1156
01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:22.805
I don't know.
Well, you're not...

1157
01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:27.726
You're not the usual sort
of woman that I associate with.

1158
01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:36.443
You asked me a question
in the bar

1159
01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:38.320
before your friends came.

1160
01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:40.364
Yeah.

1161
01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.867
I asked you if you'd ever
been in love before.

1162
01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:48.414
The answer is yes.

1163
01:17:53.544 --> 01:17:57.089
When I was really young,
I got pregnant.

1164
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:02.386
Back then, I was
a different kind of person.

1165
01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:06.682
I don't even
remember the conception

1166
01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:09.435
or who the guy was.

1167
01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:14.857
Anyway, I decided
to keep the baby.

1168
01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:19.153
And it was like...

1169
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:24.325
A whole new window
opened up on my life.

1170
01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:31.916
I loved my son
with everything I had.

1171
01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:37.588
I loved the way he laughed.

1172
01:18:37.922 --> 01:18:40.466
I loved to hear him cry
when I left the room.

1173
01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:45.054
I loved the color of his cheeks
and his stupid little teeth.

1174
01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:50.017
I was even...

1175
01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:53.437
Starting to love god.

1176
01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:11.288
Then, one day,
god took my son away

1177
01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:12.748
and left me with nothing.

1178
01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:16.085
I prayed.
Ibegged god to tell me why.

1179
01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.421
- And he said...
- What'd he say?

1180
01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:23.801
He said nothing.

1181
01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:33.060
I don't know what lives there
in that nothingness now.

1182
01:19:33.143 --> 01:19:34.186
But he just...

1183
01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:38.857
He put a spell on me.

1184
01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:35.838
What is the matter with you?

1185
01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:38.292
Oh, I'm sorry.

1186
01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:41.962
Stop fucking laughing, then.

1187
01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:43.922
I'm sorry. No, I'm really sorry.

1188
01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:46.008
- Why did you do that?
- I'm really sorry.

1189
01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:50.554
My face!
I have a show tomorrow night!

1190
01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:52.890
- Are you sick or something?
- No, please. No.

1191
01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:54.937
Just... just leave, okay?
Come on. Just...

1192
01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.035
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The lord is with thee.

1193
01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:11.408
Blessed art thou amongst women

1194
01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:13.178
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1195
01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:14.929
Holy Mary, mother of god,
pray for us sinners

1196
01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:16.705
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

1197
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:18.999
Dear god, please listen to me,
please listen to me.

1198
01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:27.007
Please, I beg you. I beg you.
I'll do anything you want me to.

1199
01:21:27.174 --> 01:21:28.592
Please just talk to me.

1200
01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:32.179
Please just show me,
show me, please.

1201
01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:30.487
Excuse me.

1202
01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:33.282
Yes, I know it's a big diocese,

1203
01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:34.533
but someone in your office

1204
01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.927
has to know
who I'm talking about.

1205
01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:38.454
He was around the tragedy
at the Santa Teresa convent.

1206
01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:39.788
I was a sister there.

1207
01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:43.333
Okay. Yes. Okay.
I can hold on, but I am at work.

1208
01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:47.671
- What the fuck are you doing?
- It's an emergency.

1209
01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:50.507
Crazy bitch.

1210
01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:55.721
Hello? Okay, hold on.

1211
01:22:58.557 --> 01:23:00.225
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1212
01:23:00.434 --> 01:23:03.061
You're sure that's
the right number? Thank you.

1213
01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.814
You're fired.

1214
01:23:11.778 --> 01:23:13.071
You're fired!

1215
01:23:15.282 --> 01:23:16.909
You think you
might be possessed?

1216
01:23:18.076 --> 01:23:19.286
That's serious.

1217
01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:22.539
No, not really, I guess.

1218
01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:24.666
You shouldn'tjoke about that.

1219
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.961
I think I just remember Agnes.

1220
01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:30.797
Were you two close?

1221
01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:36.094
Yes. Yes, we were.

1222
01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:40.516
We had a good conversation
right before she, uh...

1223
01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.853
You know. Anyway,
she helped me rethink my life.

1224
01:23:45.103 --> 01:23:48.023
That's great. I never
would've guessed that about her.

1225
01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:53.570
So, how's it going?

1226
01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:56.573
Oh, I don't know.

1227
01:23:57.449 --> 01:24:00.369
I just walked out on my job,
so...

1228
01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.541
You know, after what
happened at Santa Teresa,

1229
01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:07.560
the church would probably
put you up for a few months

1230
01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:09.002
if you can't make rent.

1231
01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:12.714
Thanks, but I'll figure it out.
I'll call you again if! Can't.

1232
01:24:13.507 --> 01:24:14.883
Now, I'm told
your former sisters

1233
01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:17.177
invited you to join them
at villa Lucia.

1234
01:24:18.136 --> 01:24:19.596
Do you think
the life of a religious

1235
01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.014
could appeal to you again?

1236
01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:24.393
I don't think so.

1237
01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.061
It's different
than Santa Teresa.

1238
01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:28.438
It's less confined.

1239
01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:31.751
But if you no longer
hear the call.

1240
01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:33.151
Maybe not then.

1241
01:24:33.527 --> 01:24:34.820
Well, maybe not.

1242
01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:36.947
A wise man once taught me

1243
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:38.824
it's not something
you should try to fake.

1244
01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:44.329
So, can you think of any other
work you'd be passionate about?

1245
01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:47.124
No.

1246
01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:50.711
You, uh...

1247
01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:53.630
Oh, never mind.

1248
01:24:54.548 --> 01:24:55.716
What?

1249
01:24:56.883 --> 01:24:58.343
It can't be that bad.

1250
01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:02.389
I had a son.

1251
01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:04.600
He died.

1252
01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:07.495
Just now, I was thinking how
much I would've liked him

1253
01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:09.187
to grow up and be like you.

1254
01:25:10.689 --> 01:25:12.232
And that's way too much.

1255
01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.901
No, it's not.

1256
01:25:16.403 --> 01:25:17.696
It's just, um...

1257
01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:22.409
My mother died. I was 11.

1258
01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:28.707
So, that means a lot.

1259
01:25:34.004 --> 01:25:35.881
Can I ask you
a spiritual question?

1260
01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.359
Yeah, of course, it's my job.

1261
01:25:38.383 --> 01:25:40.469
I hope I can answer it.

1262
01:25:41.887 --> 01:25:43.263
How do we know god?

1263
01:25:44.514 --> 01:25:45.807
Well, there's scripture.

1264
01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:48.810
And there's a few thousand
years of church teaching.

1265
01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:50.163
I'm not talking
about any of that.

1266
01:25:50.187 --> 01:25:54.566
I'm talking about contact,
connection.

1267
01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:57.235
How do we know god?
How do you know god?

1268
01:25:57.694 --> 01:25:59.696
- In this world?
- Yeah.

1269
01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:07.954
Okay. Yeah, I'll try.

1270
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:13.335
Just remember, I haven't
been a priest very long, so.

1271
01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:17.047
All right.

1272
01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:18.965
Let's take this sandwich.
We're hungry

1273
01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:20.892
and it's all we've got,
but let's look at it.

1274
01:26:21.134 --> 01:26:23.720
First, there's this
terrible crappy bread

1275
01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:26.044
you've got to get through.
And that's most of it, really.

1276
01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:27.432
It's so much bread,

1277
01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:30.936
this starchy, substandard
awfulness, this filler.

1278
01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:33.063
Most of this sandwich,
most of this world,

1279
01:26:33.146 --> 01:26:34.648
just a bunch ofjunk
to chew through,

1280
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:35.982
hoping that it ends soon.

1281
01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:40.404
Then you got
flavorless tomatoes,

1282
01:26:41.613 --> 01:26:43.949
this wilted lettuce.
Cheese looks like death.

1283
01:26:44.282 --> 01:26:46.410
Sauce, if you had a jar of it,
you'd probably die.

1284
01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:48.995
But hidden within all
this sound and fury

1285
01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:51.755
is a thin sliver of meat.
And that's the stuff

1286
01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.500
we really came here for. Right?

1287
01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:55.711
You can imagine a better
sandwich, a better world...

1288
01:26:57.254 --> 01:26:58.380
I know I can.

1289
01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:01.299
More fulfilling, with more meat.

1290
01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:03.802
Just like you can imagine
more good people

1291
01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:06.179
when you've met one
really good one, you know?

1292
01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:08.598
Okay.

1293
01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:10.559
So for christians, at least,

1294
01:27:10.642 --> 01:27:14.104
that one really good person
who brings out the best in you,

1295
01:27:14.187 --> 01:27:16.082
makes you want to bring out
the best in other people,

1296
01:27:16.106 --> 01:27:17.106
that's Christ.

1297
01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:21.027
And if you look hard enough,
he's in this world.

1298
01:27:22.863 --> 01:27:24.239
He's the meat in the sandwich,

1299
01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:26.867
this stuff we'd realize
we were really hungry for

1300
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:29.077
if we knew ourselves
like god knows us.

1301
01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:33.290
Because Christ is god incarnate,

1302
01:27:33.373 --> 01:27:35.709
and came means meat, flesh.

1303
01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:38.533
You know, he comes to us
in a form that we can recognize,

1304
01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:40.630
god in a meat suit like us.

1305
01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:43.008
God con carne.

1306
01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:47.095
But to know him in this world,
to really know him,

1307
01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:48.805
you have to deal
with the whole sandwich.

1308
01:27:49.431 --> 01:27:51.016
And if you chew through it,

1309
01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:54.436
and you keep a pure heart,
you can know god,

1310
01:27:55.979 --> 01:27:57.397
taste god.

1311
01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:02.652
You just ate god.

1312
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:06.239
Well, he invites us to.
That's the sacrament.

1313
01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:08.784
Take this, my body,
and eat of it.

1314
01:28:10.368 --> 01:28:13.914
He invites us to the feast.
And it's a gift freely given.

1315
01:28:14.164 --> 01:28:16.333
And as long as we're willing
to open our hearts.

1316
01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:21.546
When I open my heart,
it just hurts.

1317
01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:23.465
That's right.

1318
01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:25.759
I think you know.

1319
01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:29.888
Something has to go out of you.

1320
01:28:30.222 --> 01:28:32.599
To make room
for the spirit to come in.

1321
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:36.978
We get there by loss.

1322
01:28:39.815 --> 01:28:41.441
That's what spiritual hunger is.

1323
01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:44.194
And joy can follow, too,
if we let it.

1324
01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:47.948
Like we have to say goodbye
to the people we love,

1325
01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:51.117
the people we care about.

1326
01:28:55.205 --> 01:28:56.373
I'm afraid so.

1327
01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:59.793
Hopefully not too soon.

1328
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:07.551
But no one can ever
actually say goodbye, right?

1329
01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:15.600
No.
