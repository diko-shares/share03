1
00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.706
When I met your father

2
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.541
I tried to kill him.

3
00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.918
It was love at first sight.

4
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.132
His place is with his own breed.

5
00:04:21.512 --> 00:04:22.638
That's mine!

6
00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:23.805
I got it first!

7
00:04:24.223 --> 00:04:25.933
Why should I give it to you?

8
00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:27.476
That's mine!

9
00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:31.980
You lie, Lo'ak! Give it to me!

10
00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:58.914
ONE YEAR LATER

11
00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:11.281
FORT OMATIKAYA CAMP

12
00:22:34.646 --> 00:22:37.357
BRIDGEHEAD CITY

13
00:32:03.215 --> 00:32:04.675
Put it down. Set on

14
00:32:17.688 --> 00:32:18.981
Stay calm...

15
00:33:09.656 --> 00:33:11.658
Sorry, I don't speak your language...

16
00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:14.244
with morons.

17
00:33:14.786 --> 00:33:16.496
Where's your father?

18
00:50:19.436 --> 00:50:22.648
AWA'ATLU, A METKAYIN VILLAGE

19
00:59:37.744 --> 00:59:39.538
Swim with us.

20
01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:15.574
What's wrong with them?

21
01:00:16.658 --> 01:00:18.327
These guys are bad divers.

22
01:00:18.493 --> 01:00:19.578
Arrete

23
01:00:20.162 --> 01:00:21.580
They're learning.

24
01:02:15.944 --> 01:02:21.325
And that starts with speaking the language.

25
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:25.954
You call that speaking the language?

26
01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:28.916
You sound like a three-year-old!

27
01:10:54.922 --> 01:10:58.175
It allows you to breathe underwater.

28
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:24.126
LES ROCHES DES TROIS FRÃˆRES

29
01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:52.696
Call the fish.

30
01:17:08.754 --> 01:17:10.130
What an idiot!

31
01:24:30.445 --> 01:24:32.948
I'm very sorry.

32
01:30:35.519 --> 01:30:38.313
It's very painful.

33
01:31:36.413 --> 01:31:38.040
Faster!

34
01:42:22.518 --> 01:42:25.437
I see you, sister.

35
01:42:26.188 --> 01:42:28.857
I see you, sister. I'm so happy.

36
01:42:34.738 --> 01:42:37.991
Your son is magnificent.

37
01:42:38.617 --> 01:42:41.245
Thank you for your time. How's your baby?

38
01:42:42.246 --> 01:42:44.623
My baby is strong.

39
01:42:47.459 --> 01:42:50.754
I met a boy.

40
01:43:16.113 --> 01:43:18.740
TA'UNUI VILLAGE

41
01:43:38.051 --> 01:43:39.178
This man...

42
01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:43.140
We know he's on these islands.

43
01:43:43.891 --> 01:43:44.933
Here? In this village?

44
01:43:46.268 --> 01:43:47.895
We're a clan apart.

45
01:43:48.103 --> 01:43:49.897
The man in the reflection...

46
01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:51.481
lives in the forest.

47
01:44:03.535 --> 01:44:05.621
You've got to get out of here...

48
01:44:05.787 --> 01:44:07.664
and go into the forest
look for this man...

49
01:44:29.645 --> 01:44:30.687
Stay calm.

50
01:44:32.814 --> 01:44:34.316
Stay calm! Stay calm!

51
01:44:43.534 --> 01:44:44.952
He told you he didn't know!

52
01:45:45.971 --> 01:45:47.306
I'm sorry!

53
01:45:47.806 --> 01:45:49.433
I didn't know that!

54
01:45:49.766 --> 01:45:51.393
Stop this madness!

55
03:03:23.003 --> 03:03:28.717
