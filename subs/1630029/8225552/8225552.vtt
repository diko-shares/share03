00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320
<i>The forests of Pandora...</i>

3
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.360
<i>hold many dangers.</i>

4
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.160
<i>But the most dangerous thing
about Pandora...</i>

5
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.960
<i>is that you may grow
to love her too much.</i>

6
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.320
<i>We sing the songcords to remember.</i>

7
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.920
<i>Each bead, a story in our life.</i>

8
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.880
<i>A bead for the birth of our son.</i>

9
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.720
Neteyam!

10
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.600
Neteyam!

11
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.480
<i>A bead,
when we adopted our daughter, Kiri.</i>

12
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.520
<i>Born of Grace's avatar.</i>

13
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.880
<i>A daughter whose
conception was a total mystery.</i>

14
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.160
<i>A bead
for the first communion with Eywa.</i>

15
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.320
<i>The People say we live in Eywa...</i>

16
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.960
<i>and Eywa lives in us.</i>

17
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.320
<i>The Great Mother
holds all her children in her heart.</i>

18
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.320
<i>Happiness is simple.</i>

19
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.720
<i>But who would've thought a
jarhead like me could crack the code?</i>

20
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.400
<font color=#00FFFF>When I first met your father
I was trying to kill him.</font>

21
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.600
<font color=#00FFFF>It was love at first sight.</font>

22
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.240
<i>Before I knew it, we had four.</i>

23
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.000
<i>When we sent the Sky People
back to Earth a few of 'em stayed.</i>

24
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.360
<i>Science guys, loyal to the Na'vi.</i>

25
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.360
<i>And then there was Spider.</i>

26
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.960
<i>He was just stuck here.
Too young for a cryo-capsule.</i>

27
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.440
-You little wild man.
-See you, Norm!

28
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.560
<i>Orphaned by the war
he was raised by the lab guys.</i>

29
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.080
-Spider, take your spare!
-I'm just going to the village!

30
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.440
<i>He wasn't part of our family.
He was like a stray cat.</i>

31
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.520
<i>Just always around.</i>

32
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.960
<i>Inseparable from our kids.</i>

33
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.200
<i>To Neytiri he would always be alien.</i>

34
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.040
<i>One of them.</i>

35
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.960
<font color=#00FFFF>He belongs with his own kind.</font>

36
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.360
<font color=#00FFFF>It's mine! I had it first.</font>

37
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.120
<font color=#00FFFF>Why should I let you have it?</font>

38
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.320
<i>Took a few years to get the
language through my thick skull.</i>

39
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.800
<i>But now when I hear it...
it might as well be English.</i>

40
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.200
I hate you!

41
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.640
Well, I hate you times infinity, Lo'ak!
Penis face!

42
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.560
Hey! Hey! That's enough.

43
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.600
Don't make me come over there.

44
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.120
He's gonna come out
from behind those big rocks.

45
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.440
There he is.

46
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.040
There you go. Go get it! Yeah!

47
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.680
Hey, Neteyam, the mighty fisherman.
There you go. Good boy.

48
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.040
Wow, that's a big one.

49
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.160
By the rocks.

50
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.400
Right where you said.

51
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.200
How tall is he?

52
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.120
-He's... that tall.
-He's tall!

53
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.040
<i>Goes by too fast. Like a dream.</i>

54
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.040
-Kiri.
-Bro, come on. Come on.

55
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.040
Smile, skxawng.

56
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.320
<i>Happiness is simple.</i>

57
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.400
<i>Like date night.
Time away from the kids.</i>

58
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.840
<i>But the thing about happiness...</i>

59
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.280
<i>it can vanish in a heartbeat.</i>

60
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.280
<i>A new star in the night.</i>

61
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.360
<i>It could only mean one thing.</i>

62
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.680
<i>Ships. Decelerating.</i>

63
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.920
<i>And Sky People returning.</i>

64
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.160
<font color=#FFFFFF>ONE YEAR LATER</font>

65
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.800
-Pulse 168.
-Yeah, here it comes.

66
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.920
You're just fine.

67
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.920
Just lie still. Stay calm.

68
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.240
-Yep. Pupillary reflex is good.
-Get that out of his face.

69
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.960
Colonel... can you hear me?

70
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.360
Colonel?

71
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.320
You need to lie back down, sir.

72
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.720
-Sedate him! Sedate him!
-Get outta here.

73
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.840
-Go, go, go!
-Get security!

74
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.920
-Grab him!
-Grab him!

75
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.080
Hold him!

76
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.920
-Calm down!
-Colonel, stand down!

77
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.880
Colonel... it's me!
Corporal Wainfleet!

78
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.600
Lyle?

79
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.160
That you?

80
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.960
Yes, sir. And Z Dog.

81
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.160
And Fike.

82
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.360
I'm all right.
Let me go. I'm all right.

83
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.800
Well...

84
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.800
ain't this a bitch.

85
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.760
<i>Stand by. Two minutes to
Pandora insertion. Secure for Delta V.</i>

86
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.360
All right. Umbilical's clear.
Pulse ox 89.

87
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.320
<i>In case you haven't figured it
out yet, you're Colonel Miles Quaritch.</i>

88
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.640
<i>Only younger, taller, bluer
and not nearly as good-lookin'.</i>

89
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.160
<i>In two hours, I fly a mission
against the Na'vi's stronghold.</i>

90
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.880
<i>The powers that be thought it prudent
that I do this backup just in case.</i>

91
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.080
<i>And if you are watchin' it, well...</i>

92
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.240
<i>it means that I did
get my ticket punched.</i>

93
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.360
<i>Hey, Parker... just what the hell
am I supposed to say now?</i>

94
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.200
<i>Just remind him how this works.
Here.</i>

95
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.200
<i>So see this? This is all your
memories and your personality.</i>

96
00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.520
<i>We're gonna send
this back to Earth...</i>

97
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.000
<i>where you're growing
in a lab as we speak.</i>

98
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.560
<i>We're gonna imprint
you with it, and then...</i>

99
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.040
<i>Hey, hey, hey. Am I doin' this,
or are you doin' this?</i>

100
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.120
<i>Hurry it up. Hurry it up.</i>

101
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.760
<i>Anyway, the idea is to get the minds
of the saltiest on-world operators.</i>

102
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.000
<i>Yeah, like Corporal Wainfleet
over there...</i>

103
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.360
<i>and your humble narrator into
recombinant bodies.</i>

104
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.040
<i>You're a recom now, Colonel loaded
with my memories and my charm.</i>

105
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.240
<i>What you won't remember is my death
because it hasn't happened yet...</i>

106
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.920
<i>and it ain't gonna.</i>

107
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.360
<i>-Damn right.
-Hell yeah.</i>

108
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.040
<i>Well, whatever happened...</i>

109
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.120
<i>if you're any clone of mine, you'll
be lookin' for some payback.</i>

110
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.480
<i>And Jake Sully would be
at the top of that list.</i>

111
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.280
<i>Remember, kid,
a Marine can't be defeated.</i>

112
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.440
<i>Oh, you can kill us
but we'll just regroup in hell.</i>

113
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.920
<i>Semper fi.</i>

114
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.640
Ground team, go!

115
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.600
Take this! Go!

116
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.680
Let's go. Two minutes, people.
Let's go.

117
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.920
-Bro, we have got to get down there.
-No way! Dad will skin us!

118
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.600
-Come on. Don't be a wuss.
-Lo'ak! Get back here, you...

119
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.360
Taking the whole case! We're taking
mags, the RPGs, the stingers.

120
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.680
Bro, let's go. Come on!

121
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.920
Okay, let's go!

122
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.400
Move! Take that!
Take these weapons.

123
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.200
Here, boy. Go!

124
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.800
You don't even know how to use it.

125
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.440
Dad taught me.

126
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:06.960
Gunship's inbound!

127
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.520
Bro, come on!

128
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.440
Lo'ak, where are you? Neteyam!

129
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.960
Easy, easy, you okay?

130
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.600
-Yeah.
-Where's your brother?

131
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.400
-That way.
-Where is he? Where?

132
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.040
Get outta here! Go on!

133
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.120
Neteyam!

134
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.480
Oh, no.

135
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.760
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, God.

136
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.720
Dad?

137
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.520
What are you doin' here, boy?
What the hell were you thinkin'?

138
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.520
I'm sorry.

139
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.360
I'm sorry, sir.

140
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.440
We are not in Kansas anymore.

141
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.200
We are going to Pandora.

142
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400
Now...

143
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.240
I know you're all askin'
yourselves the same question.

144
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.200
Why so blue?

145
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.880
For our sins in our past life
we have been brought back...

146
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.200
in the form of our enemy.

147
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.080
That gives us their size,
their strength, their speed.

148
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.200
And with our training
that's a pretty potent mix.

149
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.520
-Do we have a mission yet?
-Indeed we do.

150
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.800
Our mission is to hunt down and kill
the leader of the Na'vi insurgency.

151
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.480
The one they call Toruk Makto.
Jake Sully.

152
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.520
Yeah!

153
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.560
Attack, attack! Got ya!

154
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.200
-Tuk!
-Come on!

155
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.120
I'm definitely faster
when I'm blue.

156
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.240
Skxawng.

157
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.440
No, seriously.
And the animals respect me more.

158
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.920
-They don't think of me as human.
-Wait. You're human?

159
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.600
They're coming!

160
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.680
<font color=#FFFFFF>HIGH CAMP, OMATIKAYA STRONGHOLD</font>

161
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.640
They're coming! Kiri, Spider!

162
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.040
The war party's coming back!
Come on, come on.

163
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.440
Let's go, come on.

164
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.520
-Mom!
-Tuk...

165
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.200
-Mom.
-Tuk, Tuk, Tuk.

166
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.160
Fall in.

167
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.280
You're supposed to be spotters.

168
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.160
You spot bogeys, and you call 'em in.
From a distance!

169
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.320
Does any of this sound familiar?
Get here!

170
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.800
Jesus. I let you two
geniuses fly a mission...

171
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.560
and you disobey direct orders.

172
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.760
Kiri, can you go help your
grandmother with the wounded? Please?

173
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.960
-My brother is wounded.
-It's fine.

174
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.720
-Tuk, go with her. Go.
-Dad.

175
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.560
-Sir. I take full responsibility.
-Yeah, you do.

176
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.160
That's right. 'Cause you're the older
brother. You gotta act like it.

177
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.240
MaJake.

178
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.400
Your son is actually bleeding.

179
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.000
Mother, it's fine. I...

180
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.920
Just go and get patched up.
Go on, dismissed.

181
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.160
You do understand that you
almost got your brother killed.

182
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.640
Yes, sir.

183
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.360
You're grounded.
No flying for a month.

184
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.840
Now, see to the ikran.
All of 'em.

185
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.880
Yes, sir.

186
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.440
And get that crap off your face.

187
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.960
Aw, want a kiss on the boo-boo?

188
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.080
-Give him this.
-Okay.

189
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.440
-I would use yalna bark.
-Here, drink.

190
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.040
-Oh, you would?
-And who is Tsahik?

191
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.600
You are, Grand... Move!

192
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.360
You are, Grandmother.
But yalna bark is better.

193
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.880
It stings less.

194
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.640
Mighty Warrior.

195
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.280
What?

196
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.680
Neteyam and Lo'ak
try to live up to you.

197
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.640
It is very hard on them.

198
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.440
I know.

199
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.640
You are very hard on them.

200
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.040
I'm their father. It's my job.

201
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.120
This is not a squad.
It is a family.

202
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.360
I thought we'd lost them.

203
00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.880
Hey, man. How's it going?
Hey, Spider.

204
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.720
-Your ass is mine.
-I'm right here.

205
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.880
-Avatars only... go around!
-Sorry.

206
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.480
Yeah. Those blue stripes
don't make you any bigger, bro.

207
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.680
Yeah, well, I can still kick your ass.

208
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.160
-Hell of a day.
-Long run.

209
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.520
Real hysterical, guys.

210
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.320
You know what really sucks though?
Is you can breathe Earth air for hours...

211
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.920
and I can only breathe
your air for, like, 10 seconds.

212
00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.480
Yeah, Monkey Boy, that really sucks.
For you.

213
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.680
-Hi, Max.
-Hey, kids.

214
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.440
Hey. What's up, Max?

215
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.800
What's up, Norm?

216
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.440
Hi, Ma.

217
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.240
<i>Maybe I'm just losing it out here...</i>

218
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.080
<i>but I'm seeing real evidence...</i>

219
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.760
<i>of a systemic response
on a global level.</i>

220
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.520
<i>I can't...</i>

221
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.520
<i>I won't use the term "intelligence".
It's...</i>

222
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.600
<i>maybe "awareness" is a better word.</i>

223
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.280
<i>It's like the entire biosphere
of Pandora...</i>

224
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.800
<i>is aware and capable of
this cognitive response.</i>

225
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.680
<i>Oh, crap, I can't say that.
They'll crucify me.</i>

226
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.240
<i>I mean, I need to say...</i>

227
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.000
So who do you think
knocked her up?

228
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.040
-Pretty sure it was Norm.
-Totally.

229
00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.360
You do not deserve to live.

230
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.240
No, no, no. Think about it, right?
I mean, he's the teacher's pet.

231
00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.720
He's out at the lab
with her all the time.

232
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.240
I would kill myself.
I would drink acid.

233
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.240
Bro, you're right.
He's, like, in every shot.

234
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.520
Bro, look, look,
he's giving her looks.

235
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.680
Hey.

236
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.800
See, I'm thinkin'...

237
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.560
their two avatars were out
in the woods all alone...

238
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.920
Gross!

239
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.560
Guys. I mean, sometimes it's not
so great to know who your father was.

240
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.080
Whatever.

241
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.920
Don't even remember him.

242
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.280
No, Spider.

243
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.160
-Dude.
-Spider...

244
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.800
You are not him.

245
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.400
<font color=#FFFFFF>BRIDGEHEAD CITY</font>

246
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.280
Go, go, go!
Directly inside the terminal.

247
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.320
Do not stop.

248
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.800
Masks off.

249
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.400
Sir...

250
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.800
this is the General.

251
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.600
General Ardmore.

252
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.960
Good to meet you, Colonel.

253
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.880
I've heard good things...

254
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.480
but a lot's changed
since your last tour here.

255
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.520
Walk with me.

256
00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.760
The new ops center is over here.
That just came online.

257
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.400
These Swarm Assemblers,
they can put up a building in six days.

258
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.000
We have done more here in a year
than in the previous 30 years.

259
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.400
We're not here to run a mine, Colonel.

260
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.920
As On-World Commander, I have been
charged with a greater mission.

261
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.160
Earth is dying.

262
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.520
Our task here is to tame this frontier.

263
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.320
Nothing less than to make Pandora...

264
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.560
the new home for humanity.

265
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.360
But before we can do that,
we need to pacify the hostiles.

266
00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.080
Sully's raids are becoming
bolder and more frequent.

267
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.520
His strikes are well-planned.

268
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.240
He's got tight coordination
between his ground and air assets.

269
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.920
His forces are hitting our
outlying sites. The mines, pipelines...

270
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.600
cutting off our supply chain.

271
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.320
And they hit a maglev two days ago.

272
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.720
Any intel on
Sully's base of operations?

273
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.120
Yeah. Give me the mountains.

274
00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.880
It's a cave system in the
Hallelujah Mountains somewhere.

275
00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.760
But every time we send our
forces up there, we take losses.

276
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.760
Our hardware really
stirs up the hornet's nest.

277
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.200
We only get 10 minutes in
enemy airspace they are all over us.

278
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.160
Colonel...

279
00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.120
we believe your Blue Team will
be perceived as indigenous...

280
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.760
and will not trigger
the immune response.

281
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.640
And how might we test
that hypothesis, General?

282
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.680
The hard way.

283
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.560
Outstanding.

284
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.040
<i>-We're entering hostile airspace.
-Copy that.</i>

285
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.480
-Bro!
-Go, Monkey Boy!

286
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.760
Guys, wait up!

287
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.480
-Tuk! Keep up!
-Okay, okay.

288
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.960
Bro, why'd you bring her anyway?

289
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.600
She's such a cry baby.

290
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.160
She's all, "I'm telling."

291
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.040
"You're not supposed
to go to the battlefield."

292
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.960
"I'll tell Mom if you
don't let me come."

293
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.240
Don't pick on her.

294
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.120
Come on.

295
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.560
Oh, sick!

296
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.160
Are there any dead bodies up there?

297
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.960
Bro, check it out. Come on.

298
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.520
No shit.

299
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.960
Kiri.

300
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.360
Kiri.

301
00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.200
Kiri...

302
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.560
Kiri, hey.

303
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.640
Hey.

304
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.560
Are you okay?

305
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.760
I was doing that
thing again, wasn't I?

306
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.880
Yeah, you were.

307
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.640
Kiri!

308
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.720
-Kiri!
-Kiri, we have to get back.

309
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.880
All right, come on.

310
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.080
What is it?

311
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.960
We're always supposed
to be home by eclipse.

312
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.320
It's way too big for a human.

313
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.800
-Avatars?
-Maybe...

314
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.600
but they're for sure not ours.

315
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.640
-What are you doing?
-I'm tracking.

316
00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.080
Watch your six.

317
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.040
Clear.

318
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:07.960
Perimeter up.

319
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.680
Damn!

320
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.920
We are never supposed to come here.

321
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.040
-Dad is going to ground you.
-Can you stop?

322
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:49.920
For life.

323
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.360
Bro, we have got to check this out.
Let's go.

324
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.120
Bro...

325
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.120
that's where your dad and my dad...

326
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.920
fought.

327
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.200
-That's your dad's actual suit.
-Holy shit!

328
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.680
Lyle, see if you can pull some data
off that dash cam.

329
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.440
-That thing's deader than shit, Colonel.
-So were we.

330
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.240
All right.

331
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.680
-I gotta call this in.
-No, bro, we're gonna get in trouble.

332
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.280
Let's go.

333
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.640
<i>Devil Dog, Devil Dog,
this is Eagle Eye, over.</i>

334
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.720
Eagle Eye. Send your traffic.

335
00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.240
I got eyes on some guys.

336
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.880
They look like avatars...

337
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.120
<i>but they're in full camo
and carrying ARs.</i>

338
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.360
<i>-There's six of them. Over.</i>
-What's your pos? Over.

339
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.800
We're at the old shack.

340
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.800
Who's "we"?

341
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.640
Me, Spider, Kiri...

342
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.360
and Tuk.

343
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.520
Son, you listen to me very carefully.
You pull back right now.

344
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.960
Do not make a sound.
<i>You get the hell out of there.</i>

345
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.080
<i>-Move! You copy?</i>
-Yes, sir, moving out.

346
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.520
-Go, go.
-See, I told you!

347
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.880
Dad... I know a quick way!

348
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.680
You're going to be
in so much trouble.

349
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.200
Kiri, stop!

350
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.520
Guys, come on.
It's almost eclipse, come on.

351
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.360
Put it down! Down!

352
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.160
Put it down or I'll shoot you!

353
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.200
With me.

354
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.640
Drop it! Right now!

355
00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.040
Do not move! Put your hands up!

356
00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.200
<font color=#00FFFF>Put it down. Put it down.</font>

357
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.280
Spider.

358
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.440
Get 'em! Get 'em!

359
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.560
Get over here! Come on! Get down!

360
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.800
Stop fighting. Don't move!

361
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.960
Check 'em for weapons!

362
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.480
Kiri!

363
00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.960
<font color=#00FFFF>Be calm...</font>

364
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.880
Shut up! Don't move!

365
00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.800
What have we here?

366
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.160
Hey, Colonel... check it out.

367
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.240
Four fingers. We got a half-breed.

368
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.520
Shit...

369
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.120
Show me your fingers.

370
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.880
You're his, aren't you?

371
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.120
You're his, all right.

372
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.680
Where is he?

373
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.360
<font color=#00FFFF>Sorry, I don't speak your language...</font>

374
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.960
<font color=#00FFFF>...to buttholes.</font>

375
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.120
<font color=#00FFFF>Where is your father?</font>

376
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.320
No!

377
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.560
Really? You wanna play it this way?

378
00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.000
Shut up!

379
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.320
Kiri! No! Stop!

380
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.160
Hey! Hey, don't touch her!

381
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:13.680
Hey!

382
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.480
Don't hurt her, please.

383
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.880
Don't move!

384
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.760
What's your name, kid?

385
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.760
Spider...

386
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.360
Socorro.

387
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.080
Miles?

388
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.120
Nobody calls me that.

389
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.160
Well, I'll be damned...

390
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.080
Well, I figured they
sent you back to Earth.

391
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.280
They can't put
babies in cryo, dipshit.

392
00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.920
What are we doin', boss?

393
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.960
Iron Sky, Blue One, Actual.

394
00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.920
Blue One, Iron Sky, send your traffic.

395
00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.400
<i>We are standing by for extract, over.</i>

396
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.240
Take us in.

397
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.200
Dragonfly comin' left...

398
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.640
we are go for extract.

399
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.520
<i>Be advised</i> we are bringin' in
high value prisoners.

400
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.400
-Let us go!
-Shut up!

401
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.440
Sit tight, Blue One...
we're inbound to your pos.

402
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.480
-That's bingo in ten.
<i>-We're on the clock.</i>

403
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.440
-Sit!
-Come on, in the dirt!

404
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.600
-Feet up!
-Get down on the ground!

405
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.600
Lyle... get me some audio on this.

406
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.400
Shut your mouth! Don't look up!

407
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.320
That's Sully's woman.

408
00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.920
She's an animal.

409
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.040
<i>Give it up, Quaritch.</i>

410
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.240
Sully.

411
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.680
<i>-It's all over.</i>
-Son of a bitch.

412
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.560
<i>Nothin's over while I'm breathin'.</i>

413
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.360
<i>I kinda hoped you'd say that.</i>

414
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.200
No, no, you stay with the ikran.

415
00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.800
But, Dad... I'm a warrior like you.
I'm supposed to fight.

416
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:13.720
Neteyam.

417
00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.560
I'm not gonna say it again.

418
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.200
Yes, sir.

419
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.400
Yeah, there's nothin' after that.

420
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.520
You want us to recover these remains?

421
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.480
<i>Blue One, stand by ready.
We are three minutes out.</i>

422
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.400
Heads up, three minutes.

423
00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.320
Watch our six.

424
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.440
Shut up!

425
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.600
Shut up!

426
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.560
Contact rear!

427
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.680
Contact rear!

428
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.000
Lo'ak!

429
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:55.720
Shit!

430
00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.320
-You little shit.
-Lo'ak!

431
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.680
-Tuk, come on. Go, go, go!
-Get back here!

432
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.880
Run!

433
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.200
Grab 'em!

434
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.880
Come on!

435
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.800
Cover!

436
00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.440
Come on!

437
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.560
That you, Mrs. Sully?

438
00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.120
I recognize your calling card.

439
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.240
Why don't you come
on out, Mrs. Sully?

440
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.040
You and I, we got some...

441
00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.120
unfinished business.

442
00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.400
Demon!

443
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.360
I will kill you as many
times as I have to!

444
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.080
I guess you and the Corporal
have been pretty...

445
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.720
busy, haven't you?

446
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.720
Dropped yourself a whole litter of...

447
00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.520
half-breeds.

448
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:20.800
Na'vi!

449
00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.920
Go, go, go!

450
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.800
-You okay? You okay, boy?
-Yeah.

451
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.560
-Okay. With me. Ready? Ready?
-Yes, sir!

452
00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.720
Move!

453
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.200
Come on!

454
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.480
Go, go, go!

455
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.520
Flank out. Get after 'em!

456
00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.400
Spider?

457
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.480
-Spider!
-Kiri!

458
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.360
Spider. Come! Come on.

459
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.360
-Spider. He's down there.
-No.

460
00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.040
Ma'am, we're at bingo.
Ten minutes in enemy airspace.

461
00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.520
Blue One. Get back
to the rally point now.

462
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.200
<i>Blue One... fall back.</i>

463
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.880
Fall back!
Fall back, fall back!

464
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.080
Move out! Move!

465
00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.880
Move, move, move!

466
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.640
-Kiri!
-Spider!

467
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.600
-Come, come.
-No.

468
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.400
-Come!
-Go, go, go. Come on. Let's go.

469
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.520
Hey. Hey, it's okay. You hurt?

470
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.560
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm okay.

471
00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.880
-Tuk, you hurt?
-Daddy!

472
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.400
Okay, we're clear.
We're clear. Everyone okay?

473
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.800
-Mom!
-Tuk.

474
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.080
It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

475
00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.160
Oh, thank you, Great Mother.
Thank you.

476
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.960
Thank you.

477
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.440
Where's Spider?

478
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.680
They took him.

479
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.720
They took him.

480
00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.320
Okay. It's all right, baby girl.
All right? He's a tough kid.

481
00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.160
All right.

482
00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.080
He's gonna be okay.

483
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.080
We're all gonna be okay.

484
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.520
Goddamn!

485
00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.280
Come on!

486
00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.080
Let me out of here!

487
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.280
He's completely feral.

488
00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.160
Thinks he's one of them.

489
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.640
This thing. This Quaritch.
Whatever he is...

490
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.800
-What's going on?
-He can walk right in here.

491
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.440
He can walk right under Eywa's nose.

492
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.480
-This is our family. This is our home.
-This is about our family.

493
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.960
This is about our little ones.

494
00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.240
I cannot. You cannot ask this.

495
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.000
I cannot leave my People.

496
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:25.920
I will not.

497
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.400
He's hunting us.

498
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.680
-He's targeting our family.
-You cannot ask this!

499
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.880
The children. Everything they've
ever known. The forest.

500
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.320
This is our home!

501
00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.360
He had our children.
He had 'em under his knife!

502
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.280
My father gave me this bow
as he lay dying.

503
00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.360
And he said protect the People.

504
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.200
You're Toruk Makto!

505
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.960
This will protect the People!

506
00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.880
Quaritch has Spider.
And that kid knows everything.

507
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.640
He knows our whole operation
and he can lead them right in here.

508
00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.640
If the People harbor us,
they will die.

509
00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.360
Do you understand?

510
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.960
Look, I got nothing.

511
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.920
I got no plan...

512
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.480
But I can protect this family.
That I can do.

513
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.880
I know one thing.

514
00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.680
Wherever we go...
this family is our fortress.

515
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.600
-Where is Jake Sully?
-I don't know!

516
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.520
We know that you know.

517
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.560
I don't know!

518
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.200
Just form a picture in your mind.
Is it one of the floating mountains?

519
00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.200
Let me out of here!

520
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.600
-He's fighting us. Give us a minute.
-I don't know!

521
00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.120
Just form a thought,
and we will see it.

522
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.480
I don't know!

523
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.200
Look, I don't like this
any more than you do.

524
00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.720
-Which clans would be harboring him?
-I don't know!

525
00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.840
You're gonna have to kill me!

526
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.840
Watch this. You're peaking all
over the prefrontal.

527
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.560
It's not gonna stop until you
give us something. Where is he?

528
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.400
I don't know, you buttholes! Okay?
I don't know!

529
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.480
General, let me try
the personal angle.

530
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.120
He's not your son.

531
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.480
Easy, tiger. Easy.

532
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.000
We good?

533
00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.360
Kid, you got heart.

534
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.720
Those science pukes
leaned on you pretty hard.

535
00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.360
But you gave them nothin'.

536
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.440
I respect that.

537
00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.640
I thought you might want this.

538
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.240
That's Colonel Miles Quaritch.

539
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:12.960
Deceased.

540
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.680
Killed in action.

541
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.480
I'm not that man.

542
00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.400
But I do have his memories...

543
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.800
enough to know that...

544
00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.560
well, he wasn't
always the best father.

545
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.000
But that's not an apology.

546
00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.400
I'm not your father.
Technically...

547
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.400
you and I, we're nothin'
to each other. But...

548
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.520
I can help you.

549
00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.040
I can get you outta here.

550
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.040
I'm not gonna ask you
to betray Jake Sully.

551
00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.080
I know you'd never do that.
You're loyal...

552
00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.920
and I admire loyalty.

553
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.520
Just ride along.

554
00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.800
Otherwise, I gotta give
you back to the lab coats.

555
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.360
<i>This is like stones in my heart.</i>

556
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.760
<i>Tarsem is wise for his years.</i>

557
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.600
<i>He will be a strong Olo'eyktan.</i>

558
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.320
<i>The leader must die.</i>

559
00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.200
<i>So the leader can be born.</i>

560
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.200
<i>Toruk Makto will disappear.</i>

561
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.080
<i>The People will be safe.</i>

562
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.400
<i>A father protects.</i>

563
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.240
<i>It's what gives him meaning.</i>

564
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.720
<i>One life ends.</i>

565
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.200
<i>Another begins.</i>

566
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.640
Tuk.

567
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.360
<i>The sea clans are a
world unto themselves.</i>

568
00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.960
<i>Thousands of islands.</i>

569
00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:49.480
<i>An unknown territory into which
we could just vanish without a trace.</i>

570
00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.880
Are we there yet?

571
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.160
<font color=#FFFFFF>AWA'ATLU, A METKAYINA VILLAGE</font>

572
00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.720
Hey... leave it.

573
00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.360
On me.

574
00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.400
Tuk.

575
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.840
Be nice.

576
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:07.480
Be nice.

577
00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.200
Hey.

578
00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.280
Easy. Just be cool.

579
00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.080
Look. What is that?
Is that supposed to be a tail?

580
00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.400
It's too small.
How are they supposed to swim?

581
00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.760
Do not. Rotxo, Aonung.

582
00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.080
Hey.

583
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.920
<i>Tonowari was the chief
of the Metkayina, the Reef People.</i>

584
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.000
I See you, Tonowari.

585
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.200
Jake Sully.

586
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.600
<i>I knew him as a tough leader.</i>

587
00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.080
<i>But it wasn't Tonowari
I was worried about.</i>

588
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.760
I See you, Ronal.

589
00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.160
Tsahik of the Metkayina.

590
00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.400
I See you, Ronal.

591
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.520
Why do you come to us, Jake Sully?

592
00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.760
We seek uturu.

593
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.400
Yes, sanctuary for my family.

594
00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.960
We are Reef People.
You are Forest People.

595
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.880
Your skills will mean nothing here.

596
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.760
Well, we will learn
your ways. Am I right?

597
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.920
Yes.

598
00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.160
-Their arms are thin.
-Mom.

599
00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.640
Their tails... are weak.

600
00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.360
You will be slow in the water.

601
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.600
These children...

602
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.520
-..are not even true Na'vi.
-Dad.

603
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.600
Yes, we are!

604
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.360
They have demon blood!

605
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.440
Look. Look.

606
00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.360
Look, I was born of the Sky People,
and now I am Na'vi.

607
00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.400
All right? You can adapt.
We will adapt. Okay?

608
00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.600
My husband was Toruk Makto.

609
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:54.360
He led the clans to
victory against the Sky People.

610
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.120
This you call victory?

611
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.800
Hiding among strangers?

612
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.520
It seems Eywa has turned
her back on you, Chosen One.

613
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.640
-I apologize for my mate. She's...
-Do not apologize for me.

614
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.000
...flown a long way,
and she's exhausted.

615
00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:20.880
Jake.

616
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.320
Toruk Makto is a great war leader.

617
00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.560
All Na'vi people know his story.

618
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.160
But we Metkayina...

619
00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.560
-Dad.
-...are not at war.

620
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.080
We cannot let you bring your war here.

621
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.040
I'm done with war.

622
00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.080
Okay?

623
00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.520
I just want to keep my family safe.

624
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.720
Uturu has been asked.

625
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.480
Do we have to go?

626
00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.320
We'll be okay.

627
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.880
Toruk Makto and his
family will stay with us.

628
00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.320
Treat them as our
brothers and sisters.

629
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.440
Now, they do not know the sea.

630
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.000
So they will be like babies...

631
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.600
taking their first breath.

632
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:30.320
Teach them our ways, so they
do not suffer the shame of being...

633
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.720
useless.

634
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.680
-Okay, what do we say?
-Thank you.

635
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:37.960
Thank you.

636
00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:42.000
My son, Aonung, our daughter, Tsireya,
will show your children what to do.

637
00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.920
-Father, why do...
-It is decided.

638
00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.360
Come. I will show you our village.

639
00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.360
This way.

640
00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.040
Tuk, let's go.

641
00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:04.560
Just up here.

642
00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.080
This is for you.

643
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:15.720
Your new home.

644
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.000
Yeah, this will work.

645
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.040
This is great.

646
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.120
It's nice, right?

647
00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.160
-Okay, Sullys, fall in.
-Remember?

648
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.160
-Family meeting.
-Come on. Take a knee. Let's go.

649
00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.480
-Kiri.
-What?

650
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.200
Okay.

651
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.680
I need you kids
on your best behavior.

652
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.280
I mean it.

653
00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.880
Learn fast. Pull your weight.

654
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.400
-Don't cause trouble. You got it?
-Yes, sir.

655
00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.440
I want to go home.

656
00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.920
Oh, Tuk.

657
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.720
Tuk, this is our home now.

658
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.280
Now we're gonna get through this.

659
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.360
We're gonna get through this

660
00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.280
if we have each
other's backs. All right?

661
00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.360
What does your father always say?

662
00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.320
Sullys stick together.

663
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.560
That's right. Sullys stick together.

664
00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.680
-Now this time with some feeling.
-Yeah.

665
00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:26.920
-Sullys stick together.
-Sullys stick together.

666
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:37.960
Come on.

667
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.280
<font color=#00FFFF>Swim together with us.</font>

668
00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.920
<font color=#00FFFF>What's wrong with them?</font>

669
00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.680
<font color=#00FFFF>-Those guys are bad divers.
-Stop.</font>

670
00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.600
<font color=#00FFFF>They're learning.</font>

671
00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.240
Are you all right?

672
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.560
You're too fast! Wait for us.

673
00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:11.720
-Just breathe. Breathe.
-You are not good divers.

674
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.600
Maybe good at swinging
through trees, but...

675
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.240
Come on, bro.
We don't speak this finger talk, guys.

676
00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.720
-We don't know what you're saying.
-I will teach you.

677
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.160
-Where is Kiri?
-Kiri?

678
00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.400
-Who?
-Kiri. Where is Kiri?

679
00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.760
Did you see her?

680
00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.000
Get on the ship, find a seat,
and keep out of the way.

681
00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.120
Let's go! Chop-chop.

682
00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.080
Sweet.

683
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.560
Whoa, hold on there, hotshot!

684
00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.680
You listen up.

685
00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.000
There's a tracker built in that mask.

686
00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.360
We hit the ground, and you take off,
I'll have you back in two minutes...

687
00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:00.120
and I will give you a
old-school ass-whippin'. Understood?

688
00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.840
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

689
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.280
-We up?
-Team's up.

690
00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.360
All right, listen up.

691
00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.680
Jake Sully's gone to ground.

692
00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:27.640
Don't matter.
Wherever he is, we'll find him...

693
00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.440
and his batshit crazy wife, too.

694
00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:35.520
To do so, we go Na'vi.

695
00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.640
Full tilt, all the way.
That means we...

696
00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:41.240
eat Na'vi. We ride Na'vi.

697
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.160
Think Na'vi.

698
00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:48.440
<font color=#00FFFF>And that starts with
speaking the language.</font>

699
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.960
<font color=#00FFFF>You call that speaking the language?</font>

700
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.680
<font color=#00FFFF>You sound like a three year old!</font>

701
00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.240
All right, smart guy.

702
01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.480
You just went from bein'
our monkey mascot...

703
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.160
to official interpreter.

704
01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.520
These are ilu.

705
01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.920
If you want to live here,
you have to ride.

706
01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.160
Make the bond gently.

707
01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.040
Feel his breath.

708
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.600
Feel his strength.

709
01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.640
Hold here.

710
01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.280
Hold on.

711
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.920
You all right, Forest Boy?

712
01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.400
This is a warrior's mount.
Not easy to master.

713
01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.160
Perhaps you should start with an ilu.

714
01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.680
Nah. This one.

715
01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.120
Now remember...

716
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.920
when you dive back in, good position.
Very important.

717
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.360
I got this.

718
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.200
That's it, okay.

719
01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.240
Steady.

720
01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.400
Ah, shit.

721
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.520
I love her already.

722
01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.120
Breathe in.

723
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.680
And breathe out.

724
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.880
Imagine flickering a flame.

725
01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.720
You must slow down your heartbeat.

726
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.160
Breathe in.

727
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.480
Breathe from down here.

728
01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.760
Breathe out slowly.

729
01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:45.360
Lo'ak, your heartbeat is fast.

730
01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.080
-Sorry.
-Try to focus.

731
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.560
-Okay.
-Breathe in.

732
01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.240
And breathe out.

733
01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.880
Let your mind go clear.

734
01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.960
You are learning to breathe.

735
01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.080
Come on! Keep up, losers!

736
01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.040
I got this.

737
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.600
What?

738
01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.440
Na'vi kids younger than me
do this with their bare hands.

739
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.520
Jake Sully did it the hard way?

740
01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.360
What do you think?

741
01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.760
What are we doin', Colonel?

742
01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.600
This is gonna be good.

743
01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.040
All right, move up.

744
01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.640
It's you and me, cupcake.

745
01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.720
Did I mention you're
supposed to tie the mouth shut first?

746
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.040
Thanks a lot, kid!

747
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.320
Move up, move up!

748
01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.440
You see 'em?

749
01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.240
All right, let's go.
We're Oscar Mike. Come on.

750
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.600
Let's go. We're outta here.

751
01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.960
Yeah! That's right!

752
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.960
Yeah, Colonel! Get some!

753
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.400
Yeah, Colonel! Who's up next?

754
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:42.200
The way of water has
no beginning and no end.

755
01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.640
<i>The sea is around you...</i>

756
01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:49.880
<i>and in you.</i>

757
01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.560
<i>The sea is your home...</i>

758
01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.960
<i>before your birth...</i>

759
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.560
<i>and after your death.</i>

760
01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.520
<i>Our hearts beat in
the womb of the world.</i>

761
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.000
<i>Our breath burns
in the shadows of the deep.</i>

762
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.120
<i>The sea gives...</i>

763
01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.160
<i>and the sea takes.</i>

764
01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.800
<i>Water connects all things.</i>

765
01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.640
<i>Life to death.</i>

766
01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.640
<i>Darkness...</i>

767
01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.040
<i>to light.</i>

768
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:42.720
I got it!

769
01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.560
You did it!

770
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.080
<font color=#00FFFF>It gives breath under water.</font>

771
01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.360
What is she doing?

772
01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.720
I don't know.
She's just looking at the sand.

773
01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.440
What'd you say?

774
01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.360
Are you some kind of... freak?

775
01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.440
He asked if you are a freak.

776
01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.200
-No.
-Are you sure?

777
01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.760
I mean, you're not even real Na'vi.
Look at these hands.

778
01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.160
I mean, look at them...

779
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.920
Hey!

780
01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.720
Back off, fishlips!

781
01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:16.360
-Oh, another four-fingered freak.
-Look at his little baby tail!

782
01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.200
-Don't touch me!
-Baby tail!

783
01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.440
Leave us alone!

784
01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.040
He's not normal. Look at his tail.
Aw, baby tail! It is so cute!

785
01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.400
You heard what she said.

786
01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.480
Leave them alone.

787
01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.120
Ah, big brother come...

788
01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.560
Back off!

789
01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.760
Now.

790
01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.640
Smart choice.

791
01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.480
And from now on...
I need you to respect my sister.

792
01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.280
Let's go.

793
01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.800
Buh-bye!

794
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.320
Look at them. They're all freaks.
The whole family.

795
01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.600
-Lo'ak.
-I got this, bro.

796
01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.160
I know this hand is funny.
Look, I'm a freak. An alien.

797
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.280
But it can do
something really cool. Watch!

798
01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.680
First, I ball it up
real tight like this.

799
01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.960
Okay? Then...

800
01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.400
It's called a punch, bitch!
Don't ever touch my sister again.

801
01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.480
Yeah! Aonung! Show him!

802
01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.360
Come here!

803
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.480
Hey! Hey!

804
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.080
Stop this!

805
01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.920
Stop it!

806
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.120
So stupid!

807
01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:47.320
Ow, my tail!

808
01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.600
My ear! Let go! He's got my ear!

809
01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.760
What was the one thing I asked?
The one thing!

810
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.080
-Stay out of trouble.
-Stay out of trouble.

811
01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.200
-Right.
-It was my fault.

812
01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.000
I don't think so.

813
01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.560
You gotta stop takin' the
heat for this knucklehead.

814
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.080
Look, Dad. Aonung was picking on Kiri.
He called her a freak.

815
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.560
-Go apologize to Aonung.
-What?

816
01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.520
He is the chief's son.
Do you understand?

817
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:21.480
I don't care how you do it.
Just go make peace. Just go.

818
01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.400
Hey.

819
01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.600
So what'd the other guys look like?

820
01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.000
-Worse.
-That's good.

821
01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.960
-A lot worse.
-Get outta here!

822
01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.160
What is wrong?

823
01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.760
Nothing. I'm fine.

824
01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.640
Why should I not be fine?

825
01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.920
Why can't I just be
like everyone else?

826
01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.200
Oh, Kiri.

827
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.880
Ah, what's tree boy doing here?

828
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.080
I'm sorry I hit you.

829
01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.040
So many times.

830
01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.680
We should be friends.

831
01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.920
Come hunting with us.
Outside the reef.

832
01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.160
It's where the men hunt.

833
01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.280
No way. I'm not allowed.

834
01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.160
I must be asking the wrong brother.

835
01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.000
Let's do it!

836
01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.080
Come on! Come on!

837
01:12:59.000 --> 01:12:59.960
Yeah!

838
01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.960
Keep up, Forest Boy!

839
01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.200
Yeah!

840
01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.680
<font color=#FFFFFF>THREE BROTHERS ROCKS</font>

841
01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.080
Hey, you lived!

842
01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.080
That was insane, cuz!

843
01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.160
This way. I know a good spot.

844
01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.120
<font color=#00FFFF>Call the fish.</font>

845
01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:00.840
<font color=#00FFFF>What a moron!</font>

846
01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.320
Hey, guys!

847
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.040
Hey!

848
01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.480
Aonung!

849
01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.280
Come on, this isn't funny!

850
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:41.960
Hey, Aonung!

851
01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:08.920
Holy shit!

852
01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.080
You're a tulkun.

853
01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.280
You saved my life. Thank you.

854
01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.600
Thank you.

855
01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.120
Buddy, I have no idea
what you just said.

856
01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.320
They hurt you, didn't they?

857
01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.760
I'll try to pull it out.

858
01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.360
Just trust me, okay?

859
01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:43.920
Friends?

860
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.560
That's right, we're friends. Friends.

861
01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:54.920
Bro!

862
01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.480
<font color=#00FFFF>I'm sorry.</font>

863
01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.960
So, what is it, baby girl?

864
01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.360
You missin' Spider?

865
01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.520
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

866
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.880
But that's not it.

867
01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.200
Okay...

868
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:58.960
So what is it?

869
01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.360
I feel her, Dad.

870
01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.920
You feel who?

871
01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:06.600
Eywa.

872
01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.520
I hear her breathing.

873
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.320
I hear her heartbeat.

874
01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.080
She's so close.

875
01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.360
She's just there...

876
01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.960
like a word about to be spoken.

877
01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.440
I know you think I'm crazy.

878
01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.040
You're not crazy, baby girl.

879
01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.440
So what does Eywa's
heartbeat sound like?

880
01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.600
Mighty.

881
01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.400
Tell him what you told me!

882
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.440
You like lookin' at the stars?

883
01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.360
You know, my dad came from a star.

884
01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.480
That one. Right there.

885
01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:17.760
Lo'ak!

886
01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.520
Oh, man. I'm in trouble.

887
01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.120
Go. I will see you again.

888
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.960
-The boy has returned!
-It is the Sully boy.

889
01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.520
-They found the boy.
-They found him.

890
01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.000
Hey, hey.

891
01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.280
Let's have a look at you. Okay.

892
01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.000
He's fine. He's fine... yeah.
Just a few scratches.

893
01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.400
I pray for the strength that
I will not...

894
01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:06.320
pluck the eyeballs out of
my youngest son!

895
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.920
No.

896
01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.800
My son knows better
than to take him outside the reef.

897
01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.880
The blame is his.

898
01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.920
-Okay, let's go.
-No.

899
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.400
This is not Aonung's fault.
This was my idea.

900
01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:26.880
Aonung tried to talk me out of it.
Really.

901
01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.120
Come on.

902
01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:30.600
I'm sorry.

903
01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.040
Come on.

904
01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.200
I got this.

905
01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.760
Is this true?

906
01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.880
Aonung. What were you thinking?

907
01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.880
Dad, you told me to make
friends with these kids.

908
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.760
-That's all I was trying to...
-I don't want to hear it.

909
01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:50.880
Dad...

910
01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.480
You brought shame to this family.

911
01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:56.680
Can I go now?

912
01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.040
Any more trouble, I jerk a knot
in your tail. You read me?

913
01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:02.360
Yes, sir. Lima Charlie.

914
01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.800
Where were you?

915
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.760
Yeah. What happened to
"keep an eye on your brother"?

916
01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.400
Sorry, sir.

917
01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.360
Why did you speak for me?

918
01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.640
Because I know what it's like
to be one big disappointment.

919
01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.000
I wish I'd been there.

920
01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.920
The ocean blessed
you with a gift, brother.

921
01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.800
The tulkun have not returned yet.

922
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.880
And anyway, no tulkun is ever alone.

923
01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:41.640
Well, this one was.

924
01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.360
He had a missing fin.

925
01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.280
-Like a stump. On the left side.
-Poor tulkun.

926
01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:48.920
Payakan.

927
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.600
Who's Payakan?

928
01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.640
A young bull who went rogue.
He's outcast. Alone.

929
01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.920
-And he has a missing fin.
-They say he is a killer.

930
01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.760
-No, no.
-He killed Na'vi and other tulkun.

931
01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.720
-Not here, but far to the south.
-No, he's no killer.

932
01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.640
-You are lucky to be alive.
-I'm telling you guys. He saved my life.

933
01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.400
He's my friend.

934
01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.320
My baby bro! The Mighty Warrior...

935
01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.920
who faced the killer tulkun
and lived to tell about it, huh?

936
01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.280
You guys aren't listening.

937
01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.120
-Lo'ak, I'm listening.
-Lo'ak, come back.

938
01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.520
You skxawngs.

939
01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.200
Payakan!

940
01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.240
Payakan!

941
01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:36.640
Payakan!

942
01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.080
It's good to see you.

943
01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.000
Why are you outcast? What happened?

944
01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.960
<font color=#00FFFF>It's too painful.</font>

945
01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:02.360
I trust you. You can trust me.

946
01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.440
Bro, that's disgusting!

947
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.200
<font color=#00FFFF>Go faster!</font>

948
01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:28.560
We are here.

949
01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:37.000
This is the Cove of the Ancestors.

950
01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.560
Our most sacred place.

951
01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.240
Eclipse is the best
time of day to be here.

952
01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.000
This is it.

953
01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.800
This is the Spirit Tree.

954
01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.360
<i>My beautiful daughter.</i>

955
01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:11.720
<i>Hi, Ma.</i>

956
01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:13.920
<i>I'm so happy to see you.</i>

957
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:15.960
<i>But you look troubled.</i>

958
01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:23.080
<i>My sweet girl.</i>

959
01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.240
<i>It will be okay.</i>

960
01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.520
<i>What is it, baby?</i>

961
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.280
<i>Why am I different?</i>

962
01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.960
<i>What does the Great Mother want
from me?</i>

963
01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.280
<i>Who was my father?</i>

964
01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.720
<i>Oh, my darling.</i>

965
01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.480
<i>No!</i>

966
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.040
Come on.

967
01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.120
What is wrong? What is it?

968
01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:24.920
It was a seizure.

969
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.400
Is she breathing?

970
01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.040
Is she breathing?

971
01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.280
Get her to the village! Hurry!

972
01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.320
-Let's go! Let's move!
-Tuk, come.

973
01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.120
-Hi!
-It's good to see you.

974
01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:53.440
Let's get the gear. Neteyam!
Neteyam, keep them back!

975
01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:55.640
-How is she?
-She's still unconscious.

976
01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.840
There's no bleed. There's no fracture.

977
01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:02.600
No effects of hypoxia.
The brain looks good.

978
01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:09.920
But we still have this interictal
activity right here in the prefrontal.

979
01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.760
-Okay.
-She's definitely had a seizure.

980
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.160
-I think we can rule out toxins.
-So what is it?

981
01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:18.800
-I see that I am not needed here.
-You are Tsahik!

982
01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:21.960
Remove these things.

983
01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.480
Out! You have done nothing!

984
01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.640
Come on, come on.
Let's just take a break.

985
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.680
Okay, hold on.
I gotta take her IV off.

986
01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:30.760
Tuktirey.

987
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.040
She said that she can feel Eywa.
She can hear her heartbeat.

988
01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.280
-That's it.
-What?

989
01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.560
That is classic frontal lobe epilepsy.

990
01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:49.240
-Epilepsy?
-Yep. You see visions. You get...

991
01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.640
states of religious ecstasy
like the kind she's describing.

992
01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:02.760
Pluggin' into the Spirit Tree
is some sort of a trigger.

993
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.680
You definitely can't let
her do that anymore.

994
01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.000
-What? Ever?
-Jake.

995
01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:13.120
If she seizes underwater again,
it could kill her.

996
01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.000
You're awake!

997
01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:38.360
Kiri, my sweet child.
Oh, my sweet little girl.

998
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.960
Okay, this one. "I See you."

999
01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:48.360
That's what I just said, isn't it?

1000
01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.760
Not "Naati. Ngaati."

1001
01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:56.040
All right. Like comin'
out your nose or something.

1002
01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.880
<i>Boss...</i>

1003
01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.320
long-range patrol
picked up a radar hit.

1004
01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:01.720
A rogue gunship.

1005
01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:03.640
Where?

1006
01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:05.360
<i>Eastern sea.
Four hundred klicks north.</i>

1007
01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:09.160
Hang on.

1008
01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:15.560
The signal was intermittent,
and they lost it over open water but...

1009
01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.520
if you project the track...

1010
01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:20.520
it hits this island group.

1011
01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.480
That's hundreds of islands.

1012
01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:25.600
That's a big search box
with lots of villages.

1013
01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:26.800
This is our guy.

1014
01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.600
You give me ships and aircraft,
I'll bring you back his scalp.

1015
01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.080
-Bogies inbound.
-Skipper.

1016
01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:53.520
-All stop.
-All stop.

1017
01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:54.880
All stop. Aye.

1018
01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.040
Hey.

1019
01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.680
You Scoresby?

1020
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.760
Are you the asshole
who's commandeering my ship?

1021
01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.480
That would be me.

1022
01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.920
The target's pretty much
this whole island group.

1023
01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:27.760
Never been up there.

1024
01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:31.280
You know those waters, doc.
What kinda indigenous we got?

1025
01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:35.240
Metkayina, mostly. Some Ta'unui.
Maybe fifty villages.

1026
01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:36.760
And you are who?

1027
01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.080
I'm Ian Garvin.

1028
01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:41.600
Marine biologist.

1029
01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:45.280
Fifty villages. A hundred villages.
I don't care. We'll search 'em all.

1030
01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.560
I hunt tulkun.

1031
01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.440
That's what I'm rigged for.
That's all my guys do.

1032
01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.160
I've got quotas to meet.

1033
01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:55.120
I'll be nice once.

1034
01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:56.760
Then I won't.

1035
01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.280
Well, if you can't get out of it...

1036
01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:03.400
get into it!

1037
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.560
-All crews to stations!
-Hey, don't touch.

1038
01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:11.760
-Helm, bring her up. Flight speed.
-Flight speed, aye.

1039
01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.400
What was that?

1040
01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:25.360
What's going on?

1041
01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.400
The tulkun have returned!

1042
01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:33.440
Everybody, our Brothers
and Sisters have returned.

1043
01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.520
<i>In their endless cycle of migration,
the tulkun had come home.</i>

1044
01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.360
-Kiri, come on. Come on!
-Tuk, leave me alone.

1045
01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:58.600
-Come on!
-What?

1046
01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.360
What do you want?

1047
01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:02.520
Look.

1048
01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:11.920
Come on.

1049
01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.000
Let's go meet them.

1050
01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.720
Look... it's my Spirit Sister.

1051
01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:14.120
<font color=#00FFFF>Sister, I See you.</font>

1052
01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.360
<font color=#00FFFF>I See you, Sister. I am happy.</font>

1053
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.120
<font color=#00FFFF>Your son is beautiful.</font>

1054
01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.280
<font color=#00FFFF>Thank you. How is your baby?</font>

1055
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.480
<font color=#00FFFF>My baby is strong.</font>

1056
01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:36.400
<font color=#00FFFF>I met a boy.</font>

1057
01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:40.400
<i>It was a time for stories.
Of their season apart.</i>

1058
01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:42.600
<i>Of deaths and births.</i>

1059
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.960
<i>Of old friends and new loves.</i>

1060
01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:05.280
<font color=#FFFFFF>TA'UNUI VILLAGE</font>

1061
01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.200
Children.

1062
01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.880
Be calm, my people.

1063
01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:15.560
We're looking for weapons, comms.
Any kind of tech.

1064
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.640
Get down. You too.

1065
01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.560
You see this?

1066
01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:20.560
Stay down and shut up!

1067
01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.760
<font color=#00FFFF>This man...</font>

1068
01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.560
<font color=#00FFFF>We know he is in these islands.</font>

1069
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.320
<font color=#00FFFF>Here? This village?</font>

1070
01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.120
<font color=#00FFFF>We are a totally separate clan...</font>

1071
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.560
<font color=#00FFFF>...this man in the reflection
is from the forest.</font>

1072
01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:38.880
-Now what's he saying?
-They never saw him.

1073
01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:41.480
These are Sea People.
Forest People don't come here.

1074
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.400
I ain't buyin' that.

1075
01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:52.160
<font color=#00FFFF>He needs to leave here
and go to the forest to find this man.</font>

1076
01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:56.040
They don't know anything.

1077
01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:59.600
Shoot that animal.

1078
01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.480
What the hell are you doing?

1079
01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.240
<font color=#00FFFF>Be calm.</font>

1080
01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:16.960
Your ears workin' now?

1081
01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:17.840
<font color=#00FFFF>Be calm!</font>

1082
01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.600
You see what these can do, huh?

1083
01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:22.920
Jake Sully.

1084
01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.360
Toruk Makto!

1085
01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:27.840
<font color=#00FFFF>He told you he doesn't know!</font>

1086
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.760
-Put her down!
-Get down!

1087
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.400
-Get down!
-Stop!

1088
01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.240
You make it real clear to him.

1089
01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.800
He doesn't give up Sully,
we kill the Tsahik.

1090
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.320
-No, I'm not doin' that.
-Is that right?

1091
01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.800
-I'm not gonna be a part of this!
-Get down!

1092
01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:48.640
These people don't know anything!
They don't know anything!

1093
01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:49.920
Don't move!

1094
01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.160
We really gonna waste her?

1095
01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:59.560
Please. Please don't do this.
This is wrong.

1096
01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:02.080
What you're doing here is wrong.

1097
01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:03.760
Please.

1098
01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:09.960
Burn the hooches.

1099
01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:13.880
-Hey, light 'em up.
-Light 'em up. All of 'em!

1100
01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:15.440
Flamethrowers up!

1101
01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:27.640
<font color=#00FFFF>I'm sorry!</font>

1102
01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.640
<font color=#00FFFF>I didn't know!</font>

1103
01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.600
<font color=#00FFFF>Stop this madness!</font>

1104
01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.800
I'm sorry. We're outta here.

1105
01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:38.880
Don't touch me! I'm sorry.

1106
01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:41.800
-Let's go. Saddle up.
-All right. Let's go.

1107
01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:08.000
-What's wrong?
-Sky People.

1108
01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:12.600
They're looking for you, Jake Sully.
South.

1109
01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.520
They have a human boy
who speaks Na'vi.

1110
01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.880
Did they kill anybody?

1111
01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:22.880
Not yet.

1112
01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.120
They threaten.

1113
01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:27.880
But the villagers will not
tell them where you are.

1114
01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.240
By my order.

1115
01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:39.240
We must hunt this demon.

1116
01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.360
Trap him.

1117
01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.360
Kill him.

1118
01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:44.080
We've gotta be smart.

1119
01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:45.800
We gotta be smart.

1120
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.720
If we hit Quaritch...
they're gonna know where we are...

1121
01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:51.040
and they're gonna come
here with everything they've got.

1122
01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.640
Then what is our plan?

1123
01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:57.480
That's Toruk Makto! Head down.

1124
01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.440
Has he been here?

1125
01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.240
This shit ain't workin'.

1126
01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.240
Nah, they're stonewallin' us.

1127
01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:10.960
If we turn up the heat,
he's just gonna keep runnin'.

1128
01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.640
We gotta draw him out.

1129
01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:22.680
I'm over it.

1130
01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:26.000
I've got quotas to meet.

1131
01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:27.600
You wanna hunt?

1132
01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:29.200
Let's hunt.

1133
01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:32.760
Here? Not here.
There's too many villages.

1134
01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.280
No. No, no, no.

1135
01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:38.240
Respectfully, sir,
you do not understand...

1136
01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:41.040
the kinship bonds between
the tulkun and the ocean Na'vi.

1137
01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:43.320
It would be like murdering
a member of their family.

1138
01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:46.800
If we start hunting here,
the hostiles will come after us.

1139
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.120
Exactly.

1140
01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.800
One hostile, in particular.

1141
01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:02.240
I know how you feel.

1142
01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:07.680
I feel all alone too.

1143
01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:10.800
Tell me.

1144
01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.520
Why are you outcast?

1145
01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:31.320
I'm sorry.

1146
01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:32.920
I'm so sorry.

1147
01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:37.640
It's okay.

1148
01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.160
It's okay.

1149
01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:54.640
You allowed this.

1150
01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:59.320
You allowed him to
bond with the outcast!

1151
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:02.960
Tsireya.

1152
01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.160
You disappoint me, daughter.

1153
01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:08.640
And you...

1154
01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:11.640
son of a great warrior
who has been taught better.

1155
01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:14.360
Payakan saved my life, sir.
You don't know him.

1156
01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.760
No, Lo'ak.

1157
01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:17.760
Sit.

1158
01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:20.360
Sit.

1159
01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.400
Sit down!

1160
01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:29.760
Hear my words, boy.

1161
01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:36.600
In the days of the First Songs,
tulkun fought amongst themselves...

1162
01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.120
for territory and for revenge.

1163
01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:45.480
But they came to believe that
killing, no matter how justified...

1164
01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.280
only brings more killing.

1165
01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:56.040
So all killing was forbidden.
This is the Tulkun Way.

1166
01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:58.160
Payakan...

1167
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.040
is a killer, so... he is outcast.

1168
01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:05.920
-I'm sorry, sir. But you're wrong.
-Lo'ak.

1169
01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:08.880
-You speak to Olo'eyktan!
-I know what I...

1170
01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:09.920
That's enough!

1171
01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.160
I know what I know.

1172
01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:19.680
That's enough.

1173
01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.080
I'll deal with this one.

1174
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.400
This storm will pass.

1175
01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:35.720
Lo'ak, I saw something today.

1176
01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:38.880
I saw a Forest Boy chosen by tulkun.

1177
01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:42.160
I am very proud of you.

1178
01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.760
Payakan didn't kill those boys.
I saw it all.

1179
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:48.520
The demon ship killed his
mother right in front of him.

1180
01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:50.640
He gathered the young bulls
and the reef boys together

1181
01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:51.920
to attack the ship.

1182
01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:56.640
And they were all killed,
but by the Sky People. Not by him.

1183
01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:58.560
-He's not a killer.
-No, Lo'ak.

1184
01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:02.200
By the Tulkun Way, he is.
He bears those deaths.

1185
01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:04.600
Does he have to pay for
it for the rest of his life?

1186
01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:07.120
He knows what he did was wrong.
He would never do it again.

1187
01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.720
-We must tell my father...
-No. No.

1188
01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:12.040
I'm in enough trouble
with my dad already.

1189
01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.320
Your father will understand this.

1190
01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:16.760
No, he won't.
He doesn't understand anything.

1191
01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:19.760
The whole clan hates me.
Demon blood.

1192
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.680
Alien. That's all they see.

1193
01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.360
I See you.

1194
01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:35.960
You are Brother of Tulkun.

1195
01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.040
You are one of us now.

1196
01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:57.480
You got my mother?

1197
01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:00.320
Mother and calf.
Strong signal. Range 4,000.

1198
01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:04.680
-Bring it down on the hull.
-Comin' down, aye. Foils deployed.

1199
01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:29.160
Sub teams, two minutes!
Let's get in there!

1200
01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.280
Hatches closed!

1201
01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.280
Come on, hustle! Hustle!

1202
01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:36.520
Crews to their boats. Two minutes.
Let's make some bank.

1203
01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:38.960
Boat crews!

1204
01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.520
Let's get those tie downs off!
Tie downs off!

1205
01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:48.400
All boats in! Boats in!

1206
01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:54.280
Let's go, baby!

1207
01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:05.880
We're rollin'!

1208
01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:34.600
Stand by depth charges
and fire, fire, fire!

1209
01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:57.920
What's that? What are they doin'?

1210
01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:02.160
Those are echolocation sensors.
How they navigate.

1211
01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:05.280
They have to hold them out
of the water or they'll go deaf.

1212
01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:10.520
Picadors! Get in there! Go on.
Get in there. Get up in there!

1213
01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:28.080
They're gonna cut the cow
from the rest of the pod...

1214
01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.800
using the sound cannon.

1215
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.800
They target the mother
because the calf swims slowly...

1216
01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:34.760
and she won't leave the calf.

1217
01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:36.720
Do they ever fight back?

1218
01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:39.200
Nah, never seen 'em lift a fin.

1219
01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.640
Tough bastards to kill though.

1220
01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:44.360
Sub teams, go!

1221
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:45.720
And release.

1222
01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:51.360
<i>Release, release.</i>

1223
01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:58.080
-There's our gal.
-Target in sight.

1224
01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:01.240
-3-6 is in hot with harpoons.
-Here we go, baby.

1225
01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:06.360
See, we go in from below
where there's gaps in the armor.

1226
01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:12.160
All right, let's go.
Get up in there.

1227
01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:14.400
I'm goin' in. Get me in close.

1228
01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:20.160
-Hold her steady.
-In range. Arm one.

1229
01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:23.160
Arming, target lock. And one away.

1230
01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:30.520
<i>Two's in hot.</i>

1231
01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:31.680
<i>-Arm one.
-Arming.</i>

1232
01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:32.880
<i>Fire.</i>

1233
01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.440
<i>-Good strike. Arm two.
-Arming.</i>

1234
01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:39.520
<i>Two away.</i>

1235
01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:41.680
<i>Booyah!</i>

1236
01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:44.480
<i>Nice. 3-6, you owe us a beer.</i>

1237
01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.360
You see, the bags slow her down
and keep her up at the surface.

1238
01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:53.400
Yeah.

1239
01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:56.120
Get on her! Get me in there.

1240
01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:58.760
Straight up on her. 30 meters.

1241
01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:01.160
Explosive-tipped harpoon.

1242
01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:04.240
Ten meters. Get me in there.
Put me in the pocket.

1243
01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:05.800
Now steady, steady.

1244
01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:08.720
Stay with her. Hold. Hold.

1245
01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:12.040
Line's runnin'!

1246
01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.560
Hold on to your ponytail, Colonel!

1247
01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:33.520
-Hold back full!
-Back full, aye.

1248
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.320
Hold her.

1249
01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:49.520
She takes an explosive harpoon
to the chest and she's still runnin'.

1250
01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.960
Beautiful.

1251
01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:05.480
The only way to reach
the gland is from below.

1252
01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:10.520
We drill up through the hard palate
into the brain. And...

1253
01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:17.400
These are highly intelligent beings.
Probably smarter than us.

1254
01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:20.360
-Not smarter than me.
-That is setting the bar very low.

1255
01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:21.960
Hey, I'm the one with the harpoon.

1256
01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:24.480
Yep.

1257
01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:37.400
How do you know?
That they're smarter than us?

1258
01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:39.880
More neurons, more pathways.

1259
01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:44.040
Not only are they smarter,
they're deeply emotional.

1260
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.160
More spiritual.

1261
01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:53.080
See, this region here corresponds
with our emotional centers...

1262
01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:55.560
but proportionally it's much larger.

1263
01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:58.440
They have music...

1264
01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:00.080
philosophy...

1265
01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:01.720
mathematics...

1266
01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:03.480
complex language.

1267
01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:06.480
Okay. Here we go.

1268
01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:08.600
Show me the money.

1269
01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:15.040
So that's what this is all about?

1270
01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:16.920
That's it.

1271
01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:18.040
Amrita.

1272
01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.640
Bad luck for the big guys.

1273
01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:26.000
This stuff just happens to
stop human aging. Like...

1274
01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:28.040
stops it.

1275
01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:34.360
Ounce for ounce the single most
valuable substance known to man.

1276
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.920
This little vial here is worth like...

1277
01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:40.280
80 million.

1278
01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:42.080
Think fast!

1279
01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.480
Please don't.

1280
01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:46.440
It's never funny.

1281
01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:50.520
Amrita is what's paying for
everything here on Pandora now.

1282
01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.800
Even your research.
Ain't that right, Dr. G?

1283
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.200
It's why I drink.

1284
01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.520
That's all you take?

1285
01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:01.760
I mean, you just waste the rest?

1286
01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:06.440
Drop the bags. Let's sink her!

1287
01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:10.640
No. Leave the bags.
I want 'em to know it was us.

1288
01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:14.520
I charge extra for bein' used as bait.

1289
01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:49.800
Her name is Ro'a.

1290
01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:54.760
She was my Spirit Sister.

1291
01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:59.680
She was a composer of songs.

1292
01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:02.440
Much revered.
We would sing together.

1293
01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:07.640
She waited many breeding
cycles to have this calf.

1294
01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:10.240
The clan were so happy for her.

1295
01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:15.120
What is this, Tonowari?

1296
01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:19.360
What is this?

1297
01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:43.520
My Spirit Sister and her baby
have been murdered by the Sky People!

1298
01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:46.960
This war has come to us.

1299
01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:51.040
We knew about this hunting
of our tulkun people.

1300
01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:54.000
But it was over the horizon far away.

1301
01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:55.880
Now it is here!

1302
01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:02.600
No, you don't... You gotta understand
how the Sky People think.

1303
02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:04.400
They don't care about
the Great Balance.

1304
02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.040
We don't answer to Sky People!

1305
02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:07.960
Listen. Listen to him.

1306
02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:10.280
The Sky People are not gonna stop.
This is only the beginning.

1307
02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:12.360
You gotta tell your tulkun to leave.

1308
02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.360
You gotta tell them to go far away!

1309
02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:16.360
Leave?

1310
02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:19.560
You live among us...

1311
02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:22.000
and you learn nothing!

1312
02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:25.160
We will fight to protect
our brothers and sisters!

1313
02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:26.440
No, no, no.

1314
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.280
If you attack, if you fight,
then they will destroy you!

1315
02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:34.320
They will destroy
everything that you love.

1316
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:35.920
No!

1317
02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:40.760
You hear my words! Hear my words!
Stay calm. Stay calm!

1318
02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.360
-Listen to my father.
-Damn it!

1319
02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:44.720
He speaks the truth.

1320
02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:55.560
You tell the tulkun...

1321
02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:00.000
that if they're hit by one of these,
they're marked for death.

1322
02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:05.080
And call for me... I'll silence it.

1323
02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:09.400
Saving their lives,
that's all that matters.

1324
02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:11.720
Right?

1325
02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:15.720
Saving your family.

1326
02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:29.200
Tell the tulkun!

1327
02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:31.400
Go.

1328
02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:32.920
Go!

1329
02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:37.960
We must fight.

1330
02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:42.280
MaJake.
I will not stand and do nothing!

1331
02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:45.200
It's a trap. They want us to hit back.

1332
02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:49.040
They're not hunting tulkun.
They're hunting us.

1333
02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:04.720
No way you're rolling
out of here, baby brother.

1334
02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:06.480
I have to warn Payakan
about the pingers.

1335
02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:09.760
No. You've gotta keep
your skxawng ass here.

1336
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.760
He's outcast.
There's nobody to warn him but me.

1337
02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:13.640
Bro...

1338
02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:16.920
why do you always have
to make things so hard?

1339
02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:19.360
No.

1340
02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:22.000
You mean why can't I be
the perfect son like you?

1341
02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:24.760
The perfect little soldier.

1342
02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:26.720
Well, I'm not you!

1343
02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:29.520
Okay? I'm not you.

1344
02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:33.360
He's my brother. I'm going.

1345
02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:34.760
He's your brother?

1346
02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:37.720
No, I'm your brother.

1347
02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:38.680
Lo'ak!

1348
02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:40.320
Get off me.

1349
02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.280
Lo'ak!

1350
02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:44.960
-Come back!
-Come on. He's going to Payakan.

1351
02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:57.520
Come back!

1352
02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:00.160
There's Lo'ak! Lo'ak.

1353
02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:01.440
Lo'ak!

1354
02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:03.160
Lo'ak's going to find Payakan!

1355
02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:04.360
Wait up!

1356
02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:06.680
Hold on!

1357
02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:17.360
-All crews to stations.
-Sound general call.

1358
02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:19.560
All right, people. Come on.
Let's make some money!

1359
02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:29.080
Brother!

1360
02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:30.040
Lo'ak!

1361
02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:33.720
-Lo'ak!
-Wait!

1362
02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:38.120
What is it? What's wrong?

1363
02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:41.200
Shit!

1364
02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:43.600
Stay calm. Stay calm.

1365
02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:45.520
I got this.

1366
02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:52.680
Shit!

1367
02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:57.880
Bro, come on! Help me out!

1368
02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:00.320
-Hurry, the ship's coming!
-They're over there!

1369
02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:03.800
Bro, come on!

1370
02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:06.000
Bro.

1371
02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:07.480
-Come on, bro.
-Hurry!

1372
02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:11.520
Call it in! Call Dad!
Call Dad! Just go! Do it!

1373
02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:12.720
Just do it.

1374
02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:15.400
Dad. I mean, Devil Dog.
Do you read me?

1375
02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:17.720
-Did you see where they went?
<i>-It's Eagle Eye, do you copy?</i>

1376
02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:19.200
-They went outside the reef.
-Yeah, Lo'ak.

1377
02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:19.960
<i>Dad!</i>

1378
02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:23.520
We're with a tulkun
that's under attack.

1379
02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:26.240
Killer ship's inbound.
<i>It's about two klicks out.</i>

1380
02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:28.120
-Who's with you?
<i>-It's all of us.</i>

1381
02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:31.160
<i>Aonung and Tsireya too.</i>
We're at Three Brothers Rocks.

1382
02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:33.120
You get to cover,
and you do not engage.

1383
02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:35.280
All right? You hear me?
Do not engage. We're comin'.

1384
02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:36.240
Yes, sir.

1385
02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:37.400
It's getting closer!

1386
02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:39.560
-Three, two, pull!
-Pull!

1387
02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:41.880
Kids are under attack!

1388
02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:44.200
The kids are under attack.
They were defending a tulkun.

1389
02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:45.560
It's your kids too.

1390
02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:47.400
-The demon ship?
-Yes!

1391
02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:49.920
-We gotta go!
-Weapons. Sound the alarm!

1392
02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:56.200
-You should stay back.
-I ride!

1393
02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:57.120
Come!

1394
02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:47.800
Sub teams, hatches close.
Two-minute warning.

1395
02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:55.440
Aonung!

1396
02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:58.680
-Hurry up! Come on!
-Bro, hurry up!

1397
02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:01.760
Go, go, go!

1398
02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:06.880
Pull! Now!

1399
02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:10.400
-Everybody! Together!
-Pull!

1400
02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:15.320
I'll be damned.

1401
02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:19.800
Sully's kids. Let's roll. Not you.

1402
02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:21.320
Saddle up.

1403
02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:35.760
<i>Range is 700 meters.
Pinger signal is good.</i>

1404
02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:40.280
-Pull, harder!
-Pull!

1405
02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:43.360
-Pull, harder!
-Go!

1406
02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:46.440
-It's out! Kiri, it's out!
-Go. Tuk, go.

1407
02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:48.480
Come on. Get out of here!

1408
02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:50.360
Go that way! I'll draw them off.

1409
02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:51.720
-Okay.
-Lo'ak, come.

1410
02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:56.040
Go, go, dive! Now, dive!

1411
02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:56.880
Grab on.

1412
02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:11.760
Range 300. Ready depth charges
and fire, fire, fire.

1413
02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.120
No depth charges.
Scoresby, you copy?

1414
02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:23.640
-These kids are worthless to me dead.
-Hold your fire.

1415
02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:30.720
Circle out. Get a cordon around 'em.

1416
02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.120
Get your subs in the water.

1417
02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:34.880
Sub teams, get wet.

1418
02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:24.320
Crabs flank right. Get around on 'em.

1419
02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:29.240
Don't lose 'em. Stay on 'em now.

1420
02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:32.160
-Planes up. We're goin' in!
-Oh, hell yeah!

1421
02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:04.320
Tone on lock. Two away.

1422
02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:34.560
Where is Tuk? Did you see her?

1423
02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:51.480
Tuk!

1424
02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:54.920
Target in sight.

1425
02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:01.880
-It is coming.
-We gotta go!

1426
02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:18.600
<i>-Switch net.
-Switching.</i>

1427
02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:19.400
<i>Fire!</i>

1428
02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:39.760
Hold on!

1429
02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:41.000
Let me out!

1430
02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:43.600
-Watch out!
-Tuk, move! Move your hand!

1431
02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:45.400
-Cut it!
-Hurry, hurry!

1432
02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:51.280
Hey, kid, get back here!

1433
02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:59.520
-Drop the weapon. Put the weapon down!
-Put it down. Put it down!

1434
02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:02.360
Stay down.

1435
02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:05.080
-Hey, kid, get back here!
-Get him! Get him!

1436
02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:07.760
Put the weapon down! Drop it, now!

1437
02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.360
-Put it down!
-Drop the knife. Drop it!

1438
02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:14.040
Hey! Hey, what are you doing? Stop!
Stop. Don't hurt them.

1439
02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:16.240
Stop moving.

1440
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:18.360
-Spider!
-Bro, you okay?

1441
02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:21.200
Yeah. Great, cuz. Never better.

1442
02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:24.880
Knock it off. Stay still.

1443
02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:28.600
Get back to the bridge.

1444
02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:32.680
-Keep him there!
-I'm going, I'm going.

1445
02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:36.120
Yeah. I remember you.

1446
02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:39.560
-Cuff 'em to the rail. All of 'em.
-Let's go.

1447
02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:42.440
Let's go. Move! Over here.

1448
02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:43.520
Watch 'em. They bite.

1449
02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:45.800
Get on your knees! On 'em!

1450
02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:47.360
-Give me your hand.
-No!

1451
02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:50.320
-Now the other.
-No.

1452
02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:55.080
Be brave.

1453
02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:00.560
Na'vi inbound!

1454
02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:03.760
Spread out. Weapons up.

1455
02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:04.480
Dad!

1456
02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:06.240
Push left. Spread out.

1457
02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:09.480
Stop. Stop them.

1458
02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:14.680
It's Sully.

1459
02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:17.840
300 yards.

1460
02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:27.400
They got our kids. Your daughter.
Tuk. Lo'ak.

1461
02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:30.840
<i>Jake...</i>

1462
02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:33.480
tell your friends to stand down.

1463
02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:38.120
You want your kids back...
you come out alone.

1464
02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:42.800
You know better than to
test my resolve.

1465
02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:45.160
Lo'ak! No!

1466
02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:52.360
<i>I took you under my wing, Jake.</i>
You betrayed me.

1467
02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:55.720
You killed your own.
Good men. Good women.

1468
02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:58.840
I will not hesitate
to execute your kid.

1469
02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:01.320
Just wait one.

1470
02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:13.240
Hold here.

1471
02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:16.000
They are killers of tulkun.

1472
02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:19.560
They must die. Here. Today.

1473
02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:21.360
It's me that they want.

1474
02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:23.000
That's what all this
has been about, all right?

1475
02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:25.400
The hunting of our tulkun.
The taking of our kids.

1476
02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:30.280
You brought this upon us!

1477
02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:31.760
You!

1478
02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:37.120
Well, then it's me
that has to do this.

1479
02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:46.440
Offer's fixin' to expire.
What's it gonna be?

1480
02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:49.960
Check your fire. I'm comin' out.

1481
02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:02.080
MaJake... what is happening?

1482
02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.000
<i>MaJake?</i>

1483
02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:09.240
Stay tense everybody. All weapons.

1484
02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:27.320
Easy shot.

1485
02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:29.920
You hit him now, they attack.

1486
02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:33.080
Wait till he's on board.

1487
02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:00.120
Payakan!

1488
02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:12.160
Open fire. Open fire!

1489
02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:15.400
Brother!

1490
02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:21.720
-Come about!
-Comin' about!

1491
02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:23.200
Get me around!

1492
02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:24.680
Get me a shot!

1493
02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:27.520
Go, go!

1494
02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:48.120
-Get me around!
-Go, go, go!

1495
02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:52.320
Get in there... get me in range.
Go, go, go.

1496
02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:01.760
Down!

1497
02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.440
Bloody hell!

1498
02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:12.720
Open fire! Open fire!

1499
02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:19.360
Sully's inbound. I want eyes on!

1500
02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:21.440
All right, let's go.
Saddle up. We're up!

1501
02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:03.680
Somebody shoot something!

1502
02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:19.400
Stop!

1503
02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:14.160
<i>Get after them. Go!</i>

1504
02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:34.200
Breach! Masks on!
Masks on! Go!

1505
02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:13.560
Get him out of here!

1506
02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:19.360
Calm down!

1507
02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:34.080
Go, go, go!

1508
02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:48.280
Damage report!

1509
02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:50.200
Flooding.
Compartment two and three.

1510
02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:51.400
You okay?

1511
02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:20.920
Port bow!

1512
02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.960
Hard port! Open fire!
Get me a shot!

1513
02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:27.600
Got ya!

1514
02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:47.400
-Cut us away!
-Not responding!

1515
02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:51.520
-Get us off the cable!
-Who's got the harpoon now?

1516
02:20:55.760 --> 02:20:56.960
Back full!

1517
02:21:08.080 --> 02:21:09.160
Reload!

1518
02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:14.000
Not the cable, you idiot!

1519
02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:16.400
We're dead in the water.

1520
02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:21.200
-Taking on water. Pumps on.
-Man your weapons!

1521
02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:23.560
I thought you were the
intelligent species here, Scoresby.

1522
02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:25.280
Shut ya cakehole, Garvin.

1523
02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:30.320
Where are you? Cheeky bugger.

1524
02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:32.800
You think you're
pretty clever, don't ya?

1525
02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:48.120
Get down!

1526
02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:02.560
-Pumps aren't working.
-Abandon ship!

1527
02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:03.960
-Get him to a boat!
-All crew to the boats.

1528
02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:05.920
Let's go, people! Let's move! Mask up!

1529
02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:12.360
Neteyam!

1530
02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:15.200
Hey, baby brother. Need some help?

1531
02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:17.480
Shut up. Come on. Get us loose.

1532
02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:22.560
-Okay, get Tuk out of here.
-Bro, hurry up!

1533
02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:26.680
Who's the Mighty Warrior?
Come on. Say it.

1534
02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:28.600
-Bro!
-Come on. Let's go.

1535
02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:31.360
Lo'ak!

1536
02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:34.960
They've got Spider.
We've gotta get him. Come on.

1537
02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:37.560
Come on, bro. We can't leave him.

1538
02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:46.320
Let me go!

1539
02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:49.680
No!

1540
02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:52.560
Look!

1541
02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:03.000
-Let's go, buttercup. Get up.
-I'm not your buttercup, perv!

1542
02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:06.360
-We've got to go back for her.
-Tuk, wait!

1543
02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:08.040
Sullys stick together.

1544
02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:20.680
Wait right there, guys. Wait.

1545
02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:22.680
Clear to drop!

1546
02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:25.280
Check your mask.
Make sure it's tight.

1547
02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:26.840
I'm good, dumbass.

1548
02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:31.720
Move, move! Evacuating, people.

1549
02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:39.360
Tuk... this is not a good idea.
Tuk!

1550
02:23:58.800 --> 02:23:59.640
Cut it here.

1551
02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:03.400
No!

1552
02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:10.400
I got her.

1553
02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:19.320
-We can still get this done.
-Hell yeah.

1554
02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:22.200
I can't believe I'm tied up again!

1555
02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:48.960
-Bro, come on.
-Let's go.

1556
02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:53.320
Thanks, guys.

1557
02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:57.240
-Go!
-No!

1558
02:24:57.360 --> 02:24:58.360
-Bro, come on!
-Go, go, go!

1559
02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:00.880
Go, go, go!

1560
02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:04.400
Give me that!

1561
02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:09.360
Go, go, go!

1562
02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:11.040
This way.

1563
02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:19.280
Cover, cover!

1564
02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:26.080
You see 'em?

1565
02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:37.480
Bro!

1566
02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:39.680
-That was insane, cuz.

02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:15.720
-It's okay, bro. I got you.
-Hurry. Go, go, go!

1577
02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:18.040
They have Kiri and Tuk.

1578
02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:20.280
I can't go back.

1579
02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:28.480
Dad!

1580
02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:31.680
-Dad, help! It's Neteyam!
-Hurry!

1581
02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:33.240

1582
02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:36.880
-Oh, no.
-It's Neteyam! He's hurt!

1583
02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:39.320

-Come on. Come on! Hurry, please!

1584
02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:40.800
Pull!

1585
02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:44.520
Bro, watch his head.

1586
02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:47.240
Pull! Come on!

1587
02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:53.000
Just watch his head. Okay.

1588
02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:56.800
-It's okay, bro. We got you.
-Oh, no.

1589
02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:00.720
Put pressure. Put pressure on it.

1590
02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:04.880
-Dad, I...
-It's okay. I'm here.

1591
02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:09.600
-No, no, no.
-It's okay, son. I gotcha.

1592
02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:16.280
I want to go home.

1593
02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.120
I know. I know.
It's okay, we're goin' home.

1594
02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:22.760
We're goin' home.

1595
02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:27.320
It's okay. It's okay.

1596
02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:28.400
Dad, I...

1597
02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:36.200
Neteyam...

02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:45.080
No. No, no, no. Neteyam!

1599
02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:53.920
Oh, Great Mother.

1600
02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:55.120
No, Great Mother.

1601
02:27:55.920 --> 02:27:57.360
Please.

1602
02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:00.280
Oh, my son.

1603
02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:02.880
My son. No!

1604
02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:10.080
My son!

1605
02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:14.760
No!

1606
02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:18.000
No!

1607
02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:20.720
<i>Can you hear me, Corporal?</i>

1608
02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:25.400
<i>Yeah, yeah, I think you can.</i>

1609
02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:27.520
<i>I got your daughters.</i>

1610
02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:31.480
<i>Same deal as before.</i>

1611
02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:34.040
You for them.

1612
02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:36.880
No!

1613
02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:40.480
Where are your sisters?

1614
02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:43.880
Your sisters. Where are they?

1615
02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:45.680
I don't know.

1616
02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:46.920
-Where are they?
-They're on the ship.

1617
02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:48.840
They're tied up on the ship.

1618
02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:52.760
They're at the moon pool.
At the well deck. Midships.

1619
02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:55.360
-What?
-Come on. I'll show you.

1620
02:28:55.920 --> 02:28:57.480
Come on. I'll show you.

1621
02:28:57.560 --> 02:28:58.800
<i>Talk to me, Corporal.</i>

1622
02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:00.440
-Z, up top.
-I need somethin', Jake...

1623
02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:02.160
or there's gonna be consequences.

1624
02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:04.080
Yeah, I hear you.

1625
02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:06.120
-Come on.
-Come on!

1626
02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:08.320
Let's go. We gotta go.
Come on, let's go.

1627
02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:10.040
-No!
-Let's go.

1628
02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:12.840
Listen. Listen. Listen to me.

1629
02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:19.200
Listen to me. Listen to me.
They have our daughters.

1630
02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:24.360
I need you with me.

1631
02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:28.960
And I need you to be strong.
Right now.

1632
02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:30.240
Strong heart.

1633
02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:32.800
Strong heart.

1634
02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:47.200
Let's go get our daughters.

1635
02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:02.960
You stay with your brother.

1636
02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:04.800
Dad, I want to go with you.

1637
02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:09.760
-You've done enough.
-Dad...

1638
02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:15.360
Hold fire.

1639
02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:17.560
Let's go.

1640
02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:19.560
He's coming.

1641
02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:22.240
I'm good. Go, go!

1642
02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:26.960
Let's get this guy.
It's what we came here for.

1643
02:30:31.960 --> 02:30:34.440
-Stay with him.
-No...

1644
02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:36.520
Heads on a swivel, guys.

1645
02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:57.640
Go.

1646
02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:07.600
-Where are they?
-The middle deck.

1647
02:31:07.720 --> 02:31:10.600
Where they launch the subs.
There's, like, a pool in the center.

1648
02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:12.120
They're at the forward railing.

1649
02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:15.560
No, no. Stay here.

1650
02:31:18.600 --> 02:31:19.680
<i>Talk to me, Corporal.</i>

1651
02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:23.000
<i>This ship's going down</i>
and your girls with it.

1652
02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:28.200
Your boy didn't have to die.
<i>You brought that on yourself.</i>

1653
02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:37.760
<i>You thought you could keep
your family safe, but you can't.</i>

1654
02:31:40.040 --> 02:31:41.640
<i>Only one way to keep them safe.</i>

1655
02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:48.360
<i>So let's get this over with before
you lose another kid.</i>

1656
02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:00.680
Get down!

1657
02:32:41.320 --> 02:32:42.360
-Who's down?
-Zdinarsik, you copy?

1658
02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:44.360
-Sound off!
-Clear!

1659
02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:46.960
Prager. You read?

1660
02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:49.880
Eyes up. Eyes up!

1661
02:32:58.720 --> 02:32:59.680
Move up!

1662
02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:03.160
Push left. Go!

1663
02:33:03.800 --> 02:33:06.160
-Push right. Get around on her.
-Who's got eyes?

1664
02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:51.000
MaJake.

1665
02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:58.000
It's Mom!

1666
02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:07.520
That's right.
They're coming for you.

1667
02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:57.280
Dad! Dad.

1668
02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:02.480
Okay. Where's your sister?
Where is she? Where is she?

1669
02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:05.360
-That way. That way.
-Okay, stay behind me.

1670
02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:11.400
Kiri!

1671
02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:14.040
Runnin' out of time here, Corporal.

1672
02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:18.600
You already lost one kid today.
You really wanna lose another?

1673
02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:20.680
Do not test me!

1674
02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:23.800
Just kill him, Dad!

1675
02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:28.240
-Weapons down!
-Don't!

1676
02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:29.760
-Don't do it!
-Down!

1677
02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:33.080
Kick 'em away!

1678
02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:35.880
Do it!

1679
02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:39.880
No.

1680
02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:42.600
Cuff yourself.

1681
02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:45.280
-No! No, don't hurt her, okay?
-Stand there!

1682
02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:48.440
-Don't!
-Don't move! Not a step.

1683
02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:53.080
-Cuffs on. Now.
-You son of a bitch.

1684
02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:54.640
Please, don't hurt her.

1685
02:35:57.720 --> 02:35:58.920
Release.

1686
02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:00.760
Or I cut.

1687
02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:05.280
What, you think I care about some kid?

1688
02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:10.080
He's not mine.
We're not even the same species.

1689
02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:14.640
Just please... don't hurt her.
Just please let her go.

1690
02:36:14.880 --> 02:36:16.600
-Don't.
-Please! Don't kill him.

1691
02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:19.000
Listen to me!
Let her go. Don't hurt her.

1692
02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:20.600
Mom, don't kill him.

1693
02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:23.520
A son for a son.

1694
02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:26.800
Please don't hurt her.

1695
02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:30.240
I cut.

1696
02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:33.080
Please just let her go... okay?
Just let her go.

1697
02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:36.000
No!

1698
02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:47.040
Kiri... Kiri.

1699
02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:54.520
Spider.

1700
02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:57.200
Spider... get 'em out of here.

1701
02:36:57.560 --> 02:36:59.480
Come on. Guys. Tuk.

1702
02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:01.360
I owe you a death.

1703
02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:03.520
Mom.

1704
02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:04.400
-Mama.
-Come.

1705
02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:07.120
Come on. Please... Mama.

1706
02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:10.720
You're not leaving, are you, Jake?
Knowin' I'm out there.

1707
02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:13.960
Knowin' that I'll never stop.

1708
02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:18.360
I'm coming for you. And when I do,
I'll kill your whole family.

1709
02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:20.240
Dad...

1710
02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:23.200
Then let's get it done!

1711
02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:34.440
Jake!

1712
02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:40.960
-It's coming!
-Back. Back. Get back to the ship. Go!

1713
02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:42.080
Tuk, swim, swim.

1714
02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:46.080
Stay close.

1715
02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:47.280
-Keep moving.
-Stay close.

1716
02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:50.360

1717
02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:53.240
-Mom, take my hand!
-Hold on!

1718
02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.480
Mom!

1719
02:37:59.080 --> 02:37:59.920
-Kiri, come on.
-No...

1720
02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:01.960
-Kiri, we've got to go, come on.
-No!

1721
02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:07.560
Go! Climb. Climb! Kiri, come on!

-Mom!
-Swim! Swim. Go, Tuk. Climb up.

1724
02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:21.560
Mom...

1725
02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:23.600
Go!

1726
02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:25.080
Go, go, go!

Keep climbing! Go!

1728
02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:38.640
I got you.

1729
02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:42.480
Give me your hand! Come on!

1730
02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:45.760
Open it!

1731
02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:56.080
-Open it!
-Move back.

1732
02:38:56.680 --> 02:38:57.640

Climb! Go! Go up!

1736
02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:23.400
We're rolling over!

1737
02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:25.240
-Go, go, go, go!
-Okay...

1738
02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:28.680
No!

1739
02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:30.200
Mom!

1740
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.680
Kiri! Keep going!

02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:45.400
-This way, this way!
-Okay.

1742
02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:46.200
Go!

1743
02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:52.080
Open it! Open it!

Come on!

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:08.960
Go, Tuk!

1747
02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:11.960
There's no way out!

1748
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:15.200
Stay together, okay?

1749
02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:16.560
-Yes.
-Stay together.

1750
02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:17.760
Yes.

1751
02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:48.120
Oh, Great Mother!
Oh, Great Mother, help us!

1752
02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:30.160
Kiri!

1753
02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:50.520
Bro!

1754
02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:53.840
Mom and Dad... are down there.
In the ship.

1755
02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:55.320
Grab on!

1756
02:41:55.720 --> 02:41:56.680
Bro, I'm good. Go!

1757

Okay.

Fuck!

1761

Come on, you son of a bitch!

1762
02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:51.560
-Dad, just breathe.
-Neteyam?

1763
02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:53.280
No, Dad. It's Lo'ak.

1764
02:43:54.680 --> 02:43:55.640
Oh, Lo'ak.

1765
02:43:56.920 --> 02:43:57.880
I'm sorry, sir.

1766
02:43:58.320 --> 02:43:59.960
I'm sorry about Neteyam.
It's all my fault.

1767
02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:02.320
Just focus. Focus on now.

1768
02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:22.920
We're losing the air pocket.
Come on. We've gotta move.

1769
02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:24.440
Come on, Dad.

1770
02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:33.080
You know your way out?

1771
02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:36.080
I think so. But, Dad,
it's gonna be a long breath-hold.

1772
02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:37.640
I can't make it.

1773
02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:40.200
-You can. You can.
-No.

1774
02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:43.320
-So you gotta go right now.
-I can't lose you too, Dad.

1775
02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:44.120
Please.

1776
02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:49.960
Mama, I'm scared.

1777
02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:52.360
It is all right.

1778
02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:54.200
Stay close to me.

1779
02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:56.120
Stay close to Mama.

1780
02:44:58.520 --> 02:44:59.480
It's okay.

1781
02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:18.800
You just have to slow your heart down.
Be real calm.

1782
02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:23.040
Breathe from here.
Hey, breathe from here.

1783
02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.640
The way of water has
no beginning and no end.

1784

The sea is around you and in you.

1785
02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:48.320
The sea is your home before
your birth and after your death.

1786
02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:56.040
The sea gives and the sea takes.

1787
02:45:57.240 --> 02:45:59.200
Water connects all things.

1788
02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:02.760
Life to death.

1789
02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:06.680

1792
02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:33.040
Everything's going to
be all right, little sister.

1793
02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:35.520
Mom... I'm gonna give this to you.

1794
02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:41.240
It'll help you.

1795
02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:43.640
Dad, you can do this.

1796
02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:46.600
Trust me.

1797
02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:48.120
Calm your heart.

1798
02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:51.320

1799
02:46:55.240 --> 02:46:56.200
Last breath.

1801
02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:17.320
Hold on. Just breathe.

1802
02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:18.800
Just breathe.

1803
