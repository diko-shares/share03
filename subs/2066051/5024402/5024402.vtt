2
00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:39.683
How long is this gonna take?

3
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:42.254
That's really up to you.

4
00:02:42.653 --> 00:02:43.988
Right, then.

5
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:47.925
I know how this bit goes.

6
00:02:53.597 --> 00:02:56.567
My name is
Elton Hercules John...

7
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.442
and I'm an alcoholic.

8
00:03:09.347 --> 00:03:10.814
And a cocaine addict.

9
00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:15.586
And a sex addict.

10
00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.125
And a bulimic.

11
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.595
I'm also a shopaholic,
who has problems with weed...

12
00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:28.098
prescription drugs...

13
00:03:31.268 --> 00:03:33.070
and anger management.

14
00:03:34.305 --> 00:03:35.437
Why are you here now?

15
00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.005
Well, my dealer was out of town.

16
00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:39.043
I thought this seemed like
a good alternative.

17
00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:49.186
I'm here because
I want to get better.

18
00:03:49.752 --> 00:03:52.054
What were you like
as a child, Elton?

19
00:03:52.056 --> 00:03:53.489

Reggie! You're late!

44
00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:45.235
I've had to throw your dinner
in the bin! Get inside.

45
00:05:55.812 --> 00:05:57.046
Is he back?

46
00:05:58.381 --> 00:05:59.615
What am I? Thin air?

47
00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:01.682
Wouldn't get your hopes up.

48
00:06:01.684 --> 00:06:04.118
He's very unreliable
and very selfish.

49
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.388
But will you send him up
if I'm already in bed?

50
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.690
Reggie! Move!

51
00:06:08.057 --> 00:06:10.093
Got to get this done
before I go out.

52
00:06:13.396 --> 00:06:14.961
All right, all done.

53
00:06:14.963 --> 00:06:16.763
Put it away before you go out.

54
00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:18.667
Mum, I've got to go.

55
00:06:18.968 --> 00:06:20.769
Where's my cardigan?

56
00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:46.494
What?
Did I do something wrong?

57
00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:47.928
Bloody hell, Sheila.

58
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.832
Maybe we should
get him some lessons.

59
00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:53.668
Love to. Get him out
from under my feet.

60
00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.774
Go on, play it again.

61
00:07:00.142 --> 00:07:01.843
I want to play it for Dad.

62
00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:10.783
Managed to drag yourself
home then.

63
00:07:10.785 --> 00:07:13.154
- Hello, Stanley.
- How are you, Ivy?

64
00:07:13.156 --> 00:07:14.721
Like you care.

65
00:07:14.723 --> 00:07:16.392
Come on.
You're letting in a draft.

66
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.296
How long you back?

67
00:07:22.298 --> 00:07:23.832
I've got
a couple of weeks' leave.

68
00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:26.466
Reggie's not long gone to bed.

69
00:07:26.468 --> 00:07:28.970
Go on. Pop up, say hello.

70
00:07:29.738 --> 00:07:30.972
I'll see him tomorrow.

71
00:07:32.974 --> 00:07:34.441
Any dinner left?

72
00:07:34.443 --> 00:07:36.878
Or have you fed it all
to that boy?

73
00:07:38.947 --> 00:07:40.849
My dad was passionate about...

74
00:07:41.617 --> 00:07:43.919
family and music.

75
00:07:44.954 --> 00:07:47.089
He'd talk for hours about jazz.

76
00:07:47.856 --> 00:07:49.322
He was always hugging me.

77
00:07:49.324 --> 00:07:50.358
I was very lucky.

78
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.799
I was actually
a very happy child.

79
00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:08.741
Dad, is it true
you play piano?

80
00:08:08.743 --> 00:08:10.377
I'm saving to get lessons.

81
00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:12.612
If you want to sit in here,
you'll have to be quiet.

82
00:08:12.614 --> 00:08:15.816
I'm listening to my music.

83
00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:26.795
I like this one, Dad.

84
00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:35.437
Never, ever touch
my collection without asking.

85
00:08:46.114 --> 00:08:48.083
When are you going to hug me?

86
00:08:48.817 --> 00:08:50.185
Don't be soft.

87
00:08:58.628 --> 00:09:00.160
What are you still doing up?

88
00:09:00.462 --> 00:09:01.463
Learning.

89
00:09:02.464 --> 00:09:04.332
Turn off the light.
Go to sleep.

90
00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:07.660
Crumbs! That was energetic!

91
00:10:07.662 --> 00:10:09.230
Play another one.

92
00:10:09.764 --> 00:10:12.032
The "Moonlight Sonata," Reggie.

93
00:10:14.435 --> 00:10:17.102
Mum? My piano teacher
thinks I'm good enough

94
00:10:17.104 --> 00:10:19.473
for a scholarship
at the Royal Academy of Music.

95
00:10:20.775 --> 00:10:23.243
The Royal Academy of Music?

96
00:10:23.877 --> 00:10:26.180
It has a nice ring to it.

97
00:10:26.514 --> 00:10:27.549
"Royal."

98
00:10:27.915 --> 00:10:29.283
Scissors.

99
00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:34.589
- What do you think?
- The red one's good.

100
00:10:35.955 --> 00:10:39.324
- It's only on Saturdays.
- I've things to do on weekends.

101
00:10:39.326 --> 00:10:41.562
- Can't just drop everything.
- I'll take you.

102
00:10:44.198 --> 00:10:47.232
- Where are you off to?
- Don't know.

103
00:10:47.234 --> 00:10:48.535
Haven't decided yet.

104
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:51.840
But whatever it is,
you're not invited.

105
00:10:52.172 --> 00:10:55.543
Reggie's piano teacher thinks he's
good enough for a scholarship.

106
00:10:55.943 --> 00:10:56.977
Really?

107
00:10:57.445 --> 00:10:59.310
You think he's got
that kind of talent?

108
00:10:59.312 --> 00:11:01.680
Of course, he has.
But you'd know that

109
00:11:01.682 --> 00:11:04.651
if you took the slightest bit of
interest in me or this family.

110
00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:17.364
Stop looking at that.
You're not a girl.

111
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.646
- Can we go home?
- Home? No going home.

112
00:11:34.648 --> 00:11:35.849
This is your life.

113
00:11:36.383 --> 00:11:38.552
You have to get over
that silly shyness.

114
00:11:38.951 --> 00:11:40.285
But Mum says I'll never...

115
00:11:40.287 --> 00:11:42.220
Everybody's frightened
at the beginning.

116
00:11:42.222 --> 00:11:44.558
You play at being confident.

117
00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:47.726
Life gives you
very few chances, Reggie,

118
00:11:47.728 --> 00:11:49.095
and this is one of yours.

119
00:11:49.362 --> 00:11:51.195
You show 'em you can be
as good as they are.

120
00:11:51.197 --> 00:11:53.634
Better. Number one.
You can do that, can't you?

121
00:11:54.267 --> 00:11:57.369
- Yeah, I suppose.
- Good. Go on then. Here.

122
00:11:57.371 --> 00:12:00.374
Here's for a bag of chips
and your bus fare home.

123
00:12:17.557 --> 00:12:18.859
Reginald Dwight?

124
00:12:19.292 --> 00:12:21.527
- Yes.
- Hi. How do you do?

125
00:12:23.996 --> 00:12:25.499
Good, thank you.

126
00:12:26.065 --> 00:12:27.534
Take your coat off.

127
00:12:30.437 --> 00:12:32.473
Did you not bring
something to play?

128
00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:35.374
Didn't know I had to.

129
00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:38.144
I see. Well...

130
00:12:40.246 --> 00:12:41.779
So, can you show me anything

131
00:12:41.781 --> 00:12:45.051
so I can get a sense
of where you're up to?

132
00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:07.507
Why have you stopped?

133
00:13:09.876 --> 00:13:11.277
That's as far as you got.

134
00:13:14.547 --> 00:13:16.547
You might have a good memory,
and a good ear,

135
00:13:16.549 --> 00:13:18.785
but you've an awful lot
of work to do.

136
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.421
So, wrists and back straight.

137
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:25.188
Let's start
with the C-major scale,

138
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.360
both hands, two octaves.

139
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:38.070
Hands off the table, Reginald.
Stop making that noise.

140
00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:42.742

Boy... There's a boy there.

171
00:16:15.492 --> 00:16:17.629
Reggie. What you doing?

172
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.734
Hello, son. I'm Fred.
I'm a friend of your mum's.

173
00:16:31.276 --> 00:16:34.111
You tied me down
with that kid years ago,

174
00:16:34.113 --> 00:16:36.812
and now I've finally
got a reason to leave

175
00:16:36.814 --> 00:16:40.051
and be rid of you
and this bloody house!

176
00:17:03.307 --> 00:17:05.542
He didn't even give me
a hug goodbye.

177
00:17:07.311 --> 00:17:09.446
He's no good
at showing affection.

178
00:17:09.914 --> 00:17:11.482
Never has been.

179
00:17:14.152 --> 00:17:17.387
- I wish I was someone else.
- Oh, don't be silly.

180
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.561
Well, how do you think I felt?

181
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:28.799
I was a kid.

182
00:17:34.105 --> 00:17:35.539
Heartbroken.

183
00:17:38.642 --> 00:17:40.544
People don't care though,
do they?

184
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:45.717
Anyway...

185
00:17:48.585 --> 00:17:50.454
I'd discovered records.

186
00:17:52.356 --> 00:17:53.857
And rock 'n' roll.

187
00:18:00.198 --> 00:18:03.498
I know you like him.
He's quite a dish.

188
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.104
- I would.
- Oh, Mum!

189
00:18:06.537 --> 00:18:08.873
Thanks, Mum. It's fantastic.

190
00:18:09.107 --> 00:18:12.040
You serious about wanting
to be a rock 'n' roller?

191
00:18:12.042 --> 00:18:13.842
Yeah. Of course.

192
00:18:13.844 --> 00:18:15.913
Better get you
the proper haircut, eh?

193
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.750
- Can I get it cut like Elvis?
- Enjoy it while it lasts.

194
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.783
He's like my side
of the family.

195
00:18:21.785 --> 00:18:24.454
He'll be bald as an egg
by the time he's 20.

196
00:18:44.074 --> 00:18:46.274
Congratulations to Dave.
He's won four pork chops,

197
00:18:46.276 --> 00:18:49.010
half a pound of prime mince
and a string of sausages.

198
00:18:49.012 --> 00:18:51.715
Thank you all! Thank you!

199
00:18:52.416 --> 00:18:54.015
Now, Sheila and Fred's boy

200
00:18:54.017 --> 00:18:56.319
is gonna sing us
a couple of songs on the piano.

201
00:18:56.321 --> 00:18:57.853
Reggie Dwight!

202
00:18:57.855 --> 00:18:59.655
Come on, Reg!

203
00:19:00.123 --> 00:19:01.357
Go on, boy.

204
00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:04.558
Hello.

205
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.797
Bloody hell.
Have you got a fag?

206
00:19:11.301 --> 00:19:12.603
Rubbish!

207
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.639
Reg, Reg,
play the one I like.

208
00:19:17.107 --> 00:19:18.208
Excuse me.

209
00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.542
- You can't put that there.
- Why not?

210
00:19:20.544 --> 00:19:22.145

00:27:18.851 --> 00:27:20.087
boss?

351
00:27:26.425 --> 00:27:29.493
All right,
Elton John the piano player.

352
00:27:29.495 --> 00:27:31.395
Thank you so much
for coming in.

353
00:27:31.397 --> 00:27:33.717
- Leave your details on your way...
- Please, Mr. Williams.

354
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.998
Give me a chance.

355
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.471
Um... all right.

356
00:27:37.671 --> 00:27:41.040
See if there's anything interesting
in this one and set it to music.

357
00:27:50.049 --> 00:27:51.648
Okay.
Well, I'll see you soon.

358
00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.450
Thank you for coming in.
Will I hear from you, or...

359
00:27:53.452 --> 00:27:55.332
We'll be in touch.
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

360
00:27:55.388 --> 00:27:58.290
Okay. Thanks so much
for your time.

361
00:27:58.825 --> 00:28:00.660
No worries. Come on.

362
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.939
One frothy coffee, no froth.

363
00:28:16.941 --> 00:28:19.245
- Thanks.
- We close in an hour.

364
00:28:22.148 --> 00:28:24.681
- Bernie Taupin?
- Yeah. You must be Elton?

365
00:28:24.683 --> 00:28:25.749
- Yeah.
- Hi.

366
00:28:25.751 --> 00:28:27.319
Well, that's my stage name.

367
00:28:27.821 --> 00:28:31.157
You can tell me your real name when
we get to know each other better.

368
00:28:31.524 --> 00:28:32.559
Right.

369
00:28:34.092 --> 00:28:36.327
- Uh...
- Um...

370
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.262
- I was thinking... Sorry.
- Have you ever... Sorry.

371
00:28:39.264 --> 00:28:41.232
No, no, please.
After you.

372
00:28:42.868 --> 00:28:45.003
- I like your lyrics.
- Thank you.

373
00:28:45.471 --> 00:28:48.340
Yeah, I got the tape
you sent. It's great.

374
00:28:48.874 --> 00:28:51.310
- Really good.
- Thanks.

375
00:28:52.044 --> 00:28:55.712
Hang on. Don't bother with that one.
That wasn't supposed to be in there.

376
00:28:55.714 --> 00:28:58.316
- That's sent by mistake.
- No, no, that's really good.

377
00:28:58.684 --> 00:29:00.285
I wrote a tune to it.

378
00:29:01.286 --> 00:29:02.952
- Yeah, I...
- "Border Song"?

379
00:29:02.954 --> 00:29:06.623
Yeah. I read it and I could
hear the whole tune in my head.

380
00:29:06.625 --> 00:29:09.860
It was all there, I could see all the
notes, and I just had to get it out.

381
00:29:09.862 --> 00:29:13.265
It was like my fingers couldn't work
fast enough to keep up with my brain.

382
00:29:15.468 --> 00:29:16.900
Do you ever get anything
like that?

383
00:29:16.902 --> 00:29:19.205
Uh... not really, no.

384
00:29:19.905 --> 00:29:22.106
But I can write more
for you, though, Elton.

385
00:29:22.707 --> 00:29:26.010
- I'll just send them down to you.
- Great. That'll be good.

386
00:29:26.912 --> 00:29:28.146
Great.

387
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.418
My real name's Reg Dwight.

388
00:29:33.719 --> 00:29:36.755
Cool. Yeah, that sounds
like a cowboy name.

389
00:29:38.089 --> 00:29:39.358
Yeah, all I ever...

390
00:29:39.758 --> 00:29:41.725
All I ever wanted to be
was a cowboy, you see.

391
00:29:41.727 --> 00:29:43.629
Do you like
country and western music?

392
00:29:44.196 --> 00:29:46.027
- Yeah.
- It's good, isn't it?

393
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:48.399
Have you heard "Streets of
Laredo" by Marty Robbins?

394
00:29:49.133 --> 00:29:50.435
Mmm.

395
00:29:50.735 --> 00:29:51.769

- It's catchy, Dick.

429
00:31:58.596 --> 00:32:00.696
These guys are special.
I've got an instinct for these things.

430
00:32:00.698 --> 00:32:03.133
All right, don't break your
neck sucking your own cock.

431
00:32:04.102 --> 00:32:06.738
Maybe we could put these two
into a little beat combo.

432
00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:10.005
He's the good-looking one.
We'll make him the singer.

433
00:32:10.007 --> 00:32:13.642
Oh, no, hold on. I'm tone-deaf.
Elton is... He sings the songs.

434
00:32:13.644 --> 00:32:16.012
Yeah, I could just take those
songs and leave, if you like.

435
00:32:16.014 --> 00:32:19.447
Whoa, all right, no offense.
Don't get your knickers in a twist.

436
00:32:19.449 --> 00:32:21.716
They are writing
a lot of great tunes, Dick.

437
00:32:21.718 --> 00:32:23.685
There is one
that's perfect for Lulu.

438
00:32:23.687 --> 00:32:25.155
Easy, tiger.

439
00:32:25.857 --> 00:32:27.892
You... You flatmates?

440
00:32:28.525 --> 00:32:30.526
No, we live with our mums.

441
00:32:30.528 --> 00:32:32.461
So I do the writing,

442
00:32:32.463 --> 00:32:34.423
I send it down to him,
and then he adds the music.

443
00:32:34.564 --> 00:32:36.798
Who ever heard of songwriters
not living together?

444
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.336
Yes, Lennon and McCartney
are inseparable.

445
00:32:39.703 --> 00:32:42.037
- How many songs you got?
- Um, hundreds.

446
00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:43.340
Play another one.

447
00:32:45.308 --> 00:32:46.543

00:33:21.112 --> 00:33:23.610
Sounds like 99% of 'em are shit!

457
00:33:23.612 --> 00:33:25.615
It's the one percent
I'm interested in.

458
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:29.452
Ray says you're an investment.

459
00:33:30.252 --> 00:33:31.488
But Ray knows fuck all.

460
00:33:32.089 --> 00:33:34.391
You're a couple of pricks
as far as I can tell.

461
00:33:34.758 --> 00:33:36.560
So quit that
backing-band nonsense,

462
00:33:36.993 --> 00:33:40.328
find a place to work together,
and write me tunes

463
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.999
that gray-haired old tramps'll
whistle in the street.

464
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.201
You never know.

465
00:33:45.203 --> 00:33:47.603
One day, you might have
enough for an album.

466
00:33:48.038 --> 00:33:51.108
Do that, and I'll put you

- They're struggling rock stars.
- Hello. I'm Bernie.

472
00:34:18.135 --> 00:34:20.569
Who ever heard of a rock star
with the name Bernie?

473
00:34:24.141 --> 00:34:25.541
Lovely.

474
00:34:29.513 --> 00:34:32.149
So what are your plans
now... Elton?

475
00:34:32.649 --> 00:34:34.248
Not too sure.

476
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.552
Written a lot of songs,
haven't we? Enough for an album.

477
00:34:36.986 --> 00:34:39.588
And Elton's got
himself a girlfriend now.

478
00:34:40.356 --> 00:34:42.993
Arabella,
our new landlady. Yep.

479
00:34:44.127 --> 00:34:46.295
So what about rock 'n' roll?

480
00:34:47.463 --> 00:34:50.066
What about hot chicks
and cocaine orgies?

481
00:34:50.366 --> 00:34:51.735
What about fame and fortune?

482
00:34:52.169 --> 00:34:54.503
What about the fact
that you're a fag?

483
00:34:59.307 --> 00:35:00.341
A what?

484
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:04.446
Your little friend
is a homosexual.

485
00:35:06.183 --> 00:35:07.714
No, I've got a girlfriend.

486
00:35:07.716 --> 00:35:10.653
When's that ever stopped anybody?

487
00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:16.026
Are you?

488
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.064
Don't know.

489
00:35:24.934 --> 00:35:26.936
Would it matter
if I was, Bernie?

490
00:35:30.306 --> 00:35:31.674
No, not to me.

491
00:35:35.444 --> 00:35:37.278
Might matter to Arabella,
though.

492
00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:41.548
- Yeah, mate, I'd agree on that.
- Have you met her?

493
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.953

"Who's that singing on the demos?" And I...

there is something
special that happens...

when you sing our songs.

518
00:37:02.331 --> 00:37:05.399
You heard what Dick said.
He said my hands are like midget boxers.

519
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:06.935
Who cares what Dick thinks.

520
00:37:07.936 --> 00:37:09.871
I just don't know if I'm...

521
00:37:10.705 --> 00:37:12.440
what they're looking for.

522
00:37:17.746 --> 00:37:19.882
It's time for you
to be out front.

523
00:37:27.522 --> 00:37:28.890
I love you, man.

524
00:37:31.025 --> 00:37:32.460
I do, but...

525
00:37:33.528 --> 00:37:34.996
not in that way.

526
00:37:41.303 --> 00:37:43.205
Yeah.

527
00:37:44.772 --> 00:37:47.742
Elton, time for bed.

528
00:37:54.015 --> 00:37:56.050
We became inseparable
after that.

529
00:37:57.285 --> 00:37:58.953
The brother I never had.

530
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:01.754
Do you know, in 20 years,

531
00:38:01.756 --> 00:38:05.624
we have never had
a single argument. Not once.

532
00:38:05.626 --> 00:38:08.830
Anyway, I took his advice,
told Arabella.

533
00:38:10.164 --> 00:38:12.033
She took it very well,
actually.

534
00:38:13.567 --> 00:38:16.668
You bastard!

535
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:18.170
She's killed my piano.

536
00:38:18.172 --> 00:38:20.775
You treacherous beast!

537
00:38:21.476 --> 00:38:24.645
Your music's as shitty
as you are!

538
00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.115
Hi, Mum.

539
00:38:27.582 --> 00:38:29.684
I knew you'd be back.

540
00:38:30.386 --> 00:38:33.553
You'll have to pay rent.
I'm not made of money.

541
00:38:41.795 --> 00:38:43.398
- Morning.
- Good morning.

542
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.067
- Get dressed, Reggie!
- Elton.

543
00:38:46.934 --> 00:38:49.037
I'm not having you
moping around here all day.

544
00:38:49.536 --> 00:38:50.571
We're songwriting.

545
00:38:51.072 --> 00:38:53.708
Oh, yeah?
Looks like it's going well.

546
00:38:56.412 --> 00:38:59.378
Right. I will not
have a mess in this house.

547
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.848
It's nice and tidy,
and that's how I want it to stay.

548
00:39:02.316 --> 00:39:04.417
I'll not have
a doss house around here.

549
00:39:04.419 --> 00:39:08.189
I can't do everything.
I can't cook and clean and wash.

550
00:39:08.889 --> 00:39:11.357
Rely upon me to do everything.
It's not fair.

551
00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:12.592
There's egg on this.

552
00:39:16.431 --> 00:39:19.700
I'd better go
take a shave, I think.

553
00:39:27.641 --> 00:39:28.942

592
00:42:54.381 --> 00:42:57.316
I love it. Best thing I've
heard since "Let It Be."

593
00:42:57.516 --> 00:42:59.081
Trans-fucking-Atlantic!

594
00:42:59.083 --> 00:43:00.885
Always knew
you boys could do it.

595
00:43:01.453 --> 00:43:04.123
First thing I'm gonna do is
put you on a three-album deal.

596
00:43:04.356 --> 00:43:06.925
- Three?
- A year.

597
00:43:07.426 --> 00:43:09.726
And I got you a couple of
nights at the Troubadour.

598
00:43:09.728 --> 00:43:12.931
- Doug Weston's an old friend.
- Hang on. The Troubadour?

599
00:43:13.232 --> 00:43:16.500
- It's this really cool folk club in LA.
- Yeah, we know what it is, Ray.

600
00:43:16.502 --> 00:43:18.503
Hang on. Now, let's not be
hasty, because the thing is,

601
00:43:18.505 --> 00:43:20.170
I haven't even got
a backing band yet.

602
00:43:20.172 --> 00:43:21.973
No, I've sorted the backup
band, don't worry.

603
00:43:22.307 --> 00:43:23.973
Dick, I don't wanna
appear ungrateful,

604
00:43:23.975 --> 00:43:25.509
but you can't just spring
the Troubadour on me.

605
00:43:25.511 --> 00:43:27.780
Look, it's time to do
something bold, Elton.

606
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.716
Granted, America's
a bit of a gamble,

607
00:43:31.216 --> 00:43:33.018
and you fuck up
and I'll kill ya.

608
00:43:33.952 --> 00:43:36.255
But Ray'll go, too.
He'll keep an eye on you.

609
00:43:36.722 --> 00:43:40.859
Buy yourself some new clothes.
Get something flashy.

610
00:43:41.627 --> 00:43:43.262
Let 'em know who you are.

611
00:43:44.096 --> 00:43:46.264
Put on a great fucking show,

612
00:43:47.566 --> 00:43:49.735
and just don't
kill yourself with drugs.

613
00:43:50.034 --> 00:43:51.903
Yeah?

614
00:43:52.504 --> 00:43:53.505
Yeah, all right.

615
00:43:54.673 --> 00:43:56.140
I'm gonna have a massage.

616
00:43:57.409 --> 00:43:58.510

Good to see you, Doug.

629
00:44:55.567 --> 00:44:57.535
Ray.

630
00:44:57.901 --> 00:44:59.835
How are you?
So good to see you, man.

631
00:44:59.837 --> 00:45:01.103
What'd you bring me?

632
00:45:01.105 --> 00:45:02.972
Hey, Doug. Bernie.
Nice to meet you.

633
00:45:02.974 --> 00:45:04.375
- Hi, Bernie.
- Good morning.

634
00:45:04.909 --> 00:45:06.675
- Hi. I'm Elton.
- Oh.

635
00:45:06.677 --> 00:45:08.344
Sweet. How are you?

636
00:45:08.346 --> 00:45:10.913
Monday night at the Troubadour, man.

637
00:45:10.915 --> 00:45:12.415
It's gonna blow your mind.

638
00:45:12.417 --> 00:45:14.720
Be totally packed.
You're gonna love it.

639
00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:17.052
It's a bit different
from what I expected.

640
00:45:17.054 --> 00:45:18.089
Yeah?

641
00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.156
Yeah, it's just a bit smaller.

642
00:45:20.158 --> 00:45:22.157
Well, size is
everything, my friend.

643
00:45:22.159 --> 00:45:23.793
Neil Young
played here last week

644
00:45:23.795 --> 00:45:26.562
and there were people lined
around the block.

645
00:45:26.564 --> 00:45:28.766
Man, it was just...
It was the best night ever.

646
00:45:29.267 --> 00:45:31.235
- That's a cool hat.
- Yeah?

647
00:45:31.602 --> 00:45:33.805
- You like it?
- I do like it, yeah.

648
00:45:34.505 --> 00:45:36.572
- I won that hat, in a bet.
- Oh.

649
00:45:36.574 --> 00:45:38.174
- With Bob Dylan.
- Really?

650
00:45:38.176 --> 00:45:39.375
- Yeah.
- That's cool.

651
00:45:39.377 --> 00:45:41.010
Elton. This is the band.

652
00:45:41.012 --> 00:45:43.179
I'm just gonna check
they know what they're doing.

653
00:45:43.181 --> 00:45:45.781
So, you want something to drink?
Get these guys whatever they want.

654
00:45:45.783 --> 00:45:47.217
They just flew in from England

655
00:45:47.552 --> 00:45:49.454
and, boy, their arms are tired.

656
00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.329
Whoa, dude,
what the hell are you wearing?

657
00:46:01.532 --> 00:46:02.533
My stage gear.

658
00:46:02.935 --> 00:46:05.367
Where's Reggie? Where's Reggie?
Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.

659
00:46:05.369 --> 00:46:08.037
Neil Diamond is at the bar.
He's talking to Leon Russell

660
00:46:08.039 --> 00:46:11.241
and half the fucking
Beach Boys. Huh?

661
00:46:14.579 --> 00:46:16.313
Jesus, shit, Bernie!

662
00:46:17.214 --> 00:46:18.449
Reggie?

663
00:46:18.783 --> 00:46:21.385
- Elton. I think you're overreacting.
- No.

664
00:46:22.052 --> 00:46:24.753
Bernie, you are under-reacting.

665
00:46:24.755 --> 00:46:27.323
They are the geniuses
of American music.

666
00:46:27.325 --> 00:46:29.058
I can't go out there
in front of that lot!

667
00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:33.328
Okay, okay. Then we'll tell Doug
to refund everyone's ticket,

668
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.430
- and we'll send everybody home.
- Where is he?

669
00:46:35.432 --> 00:46:38.266
- Hey, Ray.
- You've signed a contract!

670
00:46:38.268 --> 00:46:39.802
Dick's paid
your fucking airfare!

671
00:46:39.804 --> 00:46:42.439
Now get out there and play,
you little twat.

672
00:46:50.314 --> 00:46:51.516
Well, come on then.

673
00:46:52.617 --> 00:46:54.585
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

674
00:46:54.919 --> 00:46:57.153

711
00:50:24.259 --> 00:50:26.094
- This is... This is Heather.
- Hi.

712
00:50:26.096 --> 00:50:27.830
- Hello.
- You were amazing!

713
00:50:29.032 --> 00:50:30.232
Thank you.

714
00:50:31.134 --> 00:50:33.834
All right.
Enough of this bullshit.

715
00:50:33.836 --> 00:50:36.237
Who wants to go
to a party at Mama Cass's?

716
00:50:36.905 --> 00:50:40.542
I'm so drunk, and Doug's
just lent me his car.

717
00:51:02.597 --> 00:51:06.434
- How cool is this, man?
- Yeah, great.

718
00:51:07.435 --> 00:51:09.337
Apparently Dylan's
here somewhere.

719
00:51:12.273 --> 00:51:13.442
Uh...

720
00:51:13.876 --> 00:51:16.011
I'm gonna go to the teepee
with Heather.

721
00:51:16.812 --> 00:51:18.814
- Really? All right.
- Yeah.

722
00:51:19.948 --> 00:51:20.982
Okay.

723
00:51:21.449 --> 00:51:23.250
- You'll be all right, won't you?
- Yeah, of course.

724
00:51:23.252 --> 00:51:24.485
Yeah, yeah.

725
00:51:30.691 --> 00:51:32.795
So we still gonna go to
Tower Records tomorrow, then?

726
00:51:33.262 --> 00:51:37.599
Uh, well, she's talking about going to
some place called Paradise Cove tomorrow.

727
00:51:39.735 --> 00:51:41.535
But we'll go
another time, though.

728
00:51:41.537 --> 00:51:43.372
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

729
00:51:43.705 --> 00:51:44.705
Come on.

Elton.

767
00:55:11.945 --> 00:55:13.978
I know it all seems
a bit overwhelming at first,

768
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.649
but something makes me think
you'll get used to it.

769
00:55:18.685 --> 00:55:22.222
In fact, I predict you could be the
best-selling artist in America if you desire.

770
00:55:22.621 --> 00:55:24.057
So you like the song then?

771
00:55:24.623 --> 00:55:26.558
Not quite as much
as the singer.

772
00:55:31.865 --> 00:55:35.035
You don't realize what happened
at the Troubadour tonight, do you?

773
00:55:36.136 --> 00:55:38.603
Look, I'm in music management,
and let me tell you,

774
00:55:38.605 --> 00:55:42.642
there are moments in a rock
star's life that define who he is

775
00:55:43.477 --> 00:55:47.913
and how people perceive him
as he ascends into the heavens.

776
00:55:50.783 --> 00:55:52.252
You lit the blue touch paper.

777
00:55:52.651 --> 00:55:57.057
Now we can all see you
shooting light and color and...

778
00:55:57.791 --> 00:56:00.627

there is now you.

00:56:08.335 --> 00:56:09.701

00:56:12.871 --> 00:56:14.706
You can do anything you want.

782
00:56:16.042 --> 00:56:18.078
You can be anyone you want.

783
00:56:20.746 --> 00:56:22.781

Our review from the <i>LA Times</i>
has been syndicated.

801
00:57:42.794 --> 00:57:45.629
- Okay.
- Things are going crazy. I've extended our stay.

802
00:57:45.631 --> 00:57:47.830
We're in San Francisco
tomorrow for three nights.

803
00:57:47.832 --> 00:57:49.499
- Ray, slow down.
- After that we fly to NYC,

804
00:57:49.501 --> 00:57:51.769
then we're back here for
two more shows, and then...

805
00:57:52.037 --> 00:57:54.439
Dick wants us back in London
to start the new album.

806
00:57:55.007 --> 00:57:56.940
- Doug.
- "Rejoice.

807
00:57:56.942 --> 00:57:59.242
Rock music has a new star.

808
00:57:59.244 --> 00:58:03.013
He's Englishman Elton John,
a 23-year-old,

809
00:58:03.015 --> 00:58:08.786
whose debut at the Troubadour
was, in every way, magnificent."

810
00:58:09.153 --> 00:58:10.786
Whoo!

811
00:58:10.788 --> 00:58:11.989
It's happening, guys.

812
00:58:12.291 --> 00:58:13.925
Just remember,
when you get back...

813
00:58:14.393 --> 00:58:15.826
four shows you owe me.

814
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:20.065
- You said...
- Four.

815
00:58:20.465 --> 00:58:21.900
Did... You said four shows?

816
00:58:22.201 --> 00:58:24.434
- Yes.
- That's not gonna work!

817
00:58:24.436 --> 00:58:25.470
So...

818
00:58:28.675 --> 00:58:30.207
will I see you
when I get back?

819
00:58:30.209 --> 00:58:33.543
Now, don't worry about me.
Go and enjoy your moment.

820
00:58:33.545 --> 00:58:36.080
- That's what's important.
- Come to London with me.

821
00:58:37.148 --> 00:58:38.781
I can't, but, uh...

822
00:58:38.783 --> 00:58:41.852
But next time I'm there,
I'll look you up. Promise.

823
00:58:42.154 --> 00:58:44.588

the piano in those?

829
00:59:25.096 --> 00:59:27.031

And I promised if I was ever in
town, I'd look you up.

854

How long you staying?

855
01:00:55.486 --> 01:00:57.588

That depends.

Don't make me beg.

I've been hearing
your songs everywhere.

858
01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.463
Makes it very hard
to stop thinking about you.

859
01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:09.333
Really?

860
01:01:11.202 --> 01:01:12.735
Elton, what's going on?

861
01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:14.538
Are we going again
or shall we go for a pint?

862
01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:22.145
Yeah, no, yeah,
you should go for a pint.

863
01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:38.529
What do you want, Elton?

864
01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:40.596
Dinner with you.

865
01:01:40.598 --> 01:01:42.833
You're so humble,
it's embarrassing.

866
01:01:43.434 --> 01:01:46.169
A millionaire rock star who
lives at home with his mum.

867
01:01:48.304 --> 01:01:49.639
Things are serious now.

868
01:01:49.973 --> 01:01:52.475
Be brave. Think big.

869
01:01:53.677 --> 01:01:54.978
What do you really want?

01:02:01.419 --> 01:02:03.587

No one's
getting phased out, Dick.

904
01:04:09.344 --> 01:04:12.748
Elton feels things will run more
smoothly if he has personal management.

905
01:04:14.049 --> 01:04:16.920
- There's never been a problem before.
- And there isn't one now.

906
01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:20.955
Look, there's loads of work and
commitments, tours, etcetera.

907
01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:23.189
That's what I'll be doing,
personal management.

908
01:04:23.191 --> 01:04:25.193
- Taking care of things.
- Is that right?

909
01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:27.528
You realize I've got
a contract with Elton.

910
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:29.062
I've had that looked into,

911
01:04:29.064 --> 01:04:30.431
and my client
is quite entitled

912
01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:31.932
to take on
outside representation.

913
01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.335
That's what you think.

914
01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:38.173
You fucking poofter.

915
01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:42.778
And you. You're happy
with this arrangement, are ya?

916
01:04:43.211 --> 01:04:44.446
Right?

917
01:04:44.746 --> 01:04:45.949
After all these years?

918
01:04:46.348 --> 01:04:48.083
It's nothing personal, Dick.

919
01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:53.221
Come on, Ray.

920
01:04:57.859 --> 01:04:59.428
Best of luck to you, Elton.

921
01:05:04.266 --> 01:05:07.636
Your very expensive painting
is upside down.

922
01:05:10.405 --> 01:05:13.408
- After you, Mr. James.
- Thank you, Raymond.

923
01:05:15.243 --> 01:05:16.846
Well...

924
01:05:17.312 --> 01:05:19.348
that was absolutely horrible.

925
01:05:19.948 --> 01:05:22.749
Don't worry, it's business.
Dick's a big boy, he'll be fine.

926
01:05:22.751 --> 01:05:26.820
Mr. Reid, Lord Grade's office have called
about the Royal Variety Performance.

927
01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:29.022
Apparently,
the Queen Mother is a big fan.

928
01:05:29.024 --> 01:05:32.359
Couldn't we have kept on Ray?
He's such a lovely guy.

929
01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:34.196
"Lovely guy" is not a job.

930
01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:37.432
This is a crucial time,
Elton.

931
01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.433
You and I are gonna
have to be more careful,

932
01:05:40.435 --> 01:05:42.103
'cause the papers
have been sniffing around.

933
01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.572
We can't give them
anything to speculate on.

934
01:05:44.873 --> 01:05:47.174
I'm thinking of getting
someone in as your girlfriend.

935
01:05:47.876 --> 01:05:50.378
- Doesn't that seem a bit excessive?
- No, no, no, no, no.

936
01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:52.646
This is your career
and our business at stake.

937
01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:55.149
If our sleeping
arrangements get out...

938
01:05:55.517 --> 01:05:57.452
- all of this is gone.
- Right.

939
01:05:57.886 --> 01:06:00.055
And you're gonna have
to talk to your parents.

940
01:06:00.522 --> 01:06:02.088
Make sure they know
what to say.

941
01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:04.159
Those are the first doors
reporters knock on.

942
01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:17.171
- Hello, Reg.
- Hello, Dad.

943
01:06:23.177 --> 01:06:25.714
Well, come on in.

944
01:06:27.082 --> 01:06:29.284
Well, those are
very fancy shoes.

945
01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:31.520
Oh. Yeah.

946
01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.555
I brought you something.

947
01:06:44.198 --> 01:06:45.433
Why are you here, Reg?

948
01:06:47.836 --> 01:06:49.736
The boys.

949
01:06:53.307 --> 01:06:55.508
Dad, there's
a Rolls-Royce outside.

950
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:57.378
Stephen, Geoff...

951
01:06:58.312 --> 01:07:00.648
this is your brother, Reggie.

952
01:07:00.915 --> 01:07:02.016
Half brother.

953
01:07:02.483 --> 01:07:04.452
Not actually called
Reggie anymore.

954
01:07:05.786 --> 01:07:06.786
Hmm.

955
01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:09.055
I thought maybe
once I'm back from touring,

956
01:07:09.057 --> 01:07:11.026
you and I could
get together, if you like.

957
01:07:11.425 --> 01:07:14.495
I could get you some tickets
to my next concert.

958
01:07:15.229 --> 01:07:17.431
Not really my thing.

959
01:07:18.867 --> 01:07:21.969
Is it true
you're worth 25 million pound?

960
01:07:22.403 --> 01:07:24.536
Do you know,
I don't actually know.

961
01:07:24.538 --> 01:07:27.108
They're really
proud of you. Mmm.

962
01:07:27.742 --> 01:07:30.478
Yeah, we've even got
some of your records.

963
01:07:30.978 --> 01:07:34.315
Why don't you go and get the album?
Grab us a pen.

964
01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:43.692
You probably get asked this all the
time, but would you...

965
01:07:44.424 --> 01:07:46.259
Would you mind signing this?

966
01:07:49.964 --> 01:07:51.297
Yeah, of course.

967
01:07:56.937 --> 01:07:59.874
Oh, no. Would you
make it out to Arthur?

968
01:08:01.308 --> 01:08:03.310
He's one of the blokes
from work.

969
01:08:03.644 --> 01:08:05.279
Yeah, he's a big fan.

970
01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.581
- Is he?
- Mm-hmm.

971
01:08:16.857 --> 01:08:17.858
Perfect.

972
01:08:20.828 --> 01:08:21.862
Right.

973
01:08:23.296 --> 01:08:26.634
Well, looks like things worked out
really well second time around, Dad.

974
01:08:27.568 --> 01:08:28.769
- I suppose they have.
- Mmm.

975
01:08:29.403 --> 01:08:31.905
'Cause, you know,
not everybody gets a second chance.

976
01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:40.047
The boys loved
meeting a real-life pop star.

977
01:08:40.547 --> 01:08:42.615
Sure. Thanks, Dad.

978
01:08:43.017 --> 01:08:44.051
Bye.

979
01:08:47.087 --> 01:08:48.887
- When I grow up, Dad...
- Get inside.

980
01:08:48.889 --> 01:08:51.659
What are you doing
without your shoes on?

981
01:08:52.593 --> 01:08:54.428
You're gonna be a draftsman.

982
01:08:56.162 --> 01:08:57.497
Back inside.

983
01:09:24.891 --> 01:09:27.660
What have you got to do to get
a fucking drink around here, eh?

984
01:09:35.568 --> 01:09:37.037
Will you stop sulking?

985
01:09:38.973 --> 01:09:41.075
It has to be done
whether you like it or not.

986
01:09:41.608 --> 01:09:43.810
Are you gonna be scared of her
your whole life?

987
01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:46.878
Right, stop the car.

988
01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.415
- Elton...
- I said, stop the car!

989
01:09:54.288 --> 01:09:56.789
You're onstage in 15 minutes.

990
01:09:57.991 --> 01:10:00.491
You're the big-shot manager.
You make my excuses.

991
01:10:00.493 --> 01:10:04.664
Tell them I'm indisposed,
breaking my mother's heart!

992
01:10:05.299 --> 01:10:06.865
Elton. Elton!

993
01:10:06.867 --> 01:10:08.533
Drive 'round, Denis.

994
01:10:08.902 --> 01:10:10.400
<i>Liberace!</i>

995
01:10:18.745 --> 01:10:20.978
Pinner nine, seven,
double-five.

996
01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:23.716
- Mum, it's me.
- <i>I know who you are.</i>

997
01:10:25.585 --> 01:10:27.152
Well, I've got something
to tell you.

998
01:10:27.154 --> 01:10:30.122
Reggie, we're gonna miss
the bit of the show with you on.

999
01:10:30.124 --> 01:10:31.557
Look, shut up, Mum!

1000
01:10:32.258 --> 01:10:34.426
I'm not on telly yet, am I?
I'm talking to you.

1001
01:10:36.561 --> 01:10:37.797
I...

1002
01:10:38.497 --> 01:10:40.033
Me and John, we...

1003
01:10:42.235 --> 01:10:43.535
Well, the thing is...

1004
01:10:47.273 --> 01:10:50.109
I'm... a homosexual.

1005
01:10:54.447 --> 01:10:55.981
A poofter.

1006
01:10:57.317 --> 01:10:58.717
A fairy.

1007
01:10:59.484 --> 01:11:00.686
A queen.

1008
01:11:06.192 --> 01:11:07.592
Well, say something.

1009
01:11:11.064 --> 01:11:13.633
Oh, for God's sake,
I know that.

1010
01:11:16.069 --> 01:11:17.170
Known for years.

1011
01:11:19.604 --> 01:11:22.174
- You don't mind?
- Frankly, I don't care.

1012
01:11:22.941 --> 01:11:26.044
But I'd rather you keep
that sort of thing to yourself.

1013
01:11:28.281 --> 01:11:30.613
I just hope you realize
you're choosing a life

1014
01:11:30.615 --> 01:11:32.251
of being alone forever.

1015
01:11:33.419 --> 01:11:35.822
You'll never be loved properly.

1016
01:11:41.627 --> 01:11:43.628
<i>Right. Got to go.</i>

1017
01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:54.706
She said I'll never be loved.

1018
01:11:56.041 --> 01:11:57.907
Don't ever put me
in this position again.

1019
01:11:57.909 --> 01:11:59.176
You're onstage in 10 minutes,

1020
01:11:59.178 --> 01:12:00.978
so get over yourself
and do the show.

1021
01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.982
We're running a business here,
you fucking idiot.

1022
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:07.020
Don't ever put your hands on me.

1023
01:12:11.723 --> 01:12:13.792
Real love's hard to come by.

1024
01:12:20.999 --> 01:12:22.901
So you find a way
to cope without it.

1025
01:13:24.862 --> 01:13:26.597
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1026
01:13:27.099 --> 01:13:29.332
Got the number-one album
in America. Again.

1027
01:13:29.334 --> 01:13:33.735
I'm about to embark on the
highest-grossing tour in rock history.

1028
01:13:33.737 --> 01:13:35.671
I'm personally responsible
for five percent

1029
01:13:35.673 --> 01:13:38.041
of all record sales
on the entire planet,

1030
01:13:38.043 --> 01:13:40.910
and I have the biggest
headdress known to man.

1031
01:13:40.912 --> 01:13:42.879
So, yeah,
I think I'm okay, Bernie.

1032
01:13:42.881 --> 01:13:44.646
It used to just be
the two of us.

1033
01:13:44.648 --> 01:13:46.782
Now there's busloads of people
just to do the music.

1034
01:13:46.784 --> 01:13:48.551
Hang on, hang on,
don't you wanna just

1035
01:13:48.553 --> 01:13:51.256
go out there and sing without
this ridiculous paraphernalia?

1036
01:13:51.889 --> 01:13:55.093
You know,
just be yourself, Reg?

1037
01:13:56.261 --> 01:13:58.995
Why the fuck
would I want that, Bernie?

1038
01:13:58.997 --> 01:14:01.998
You wouldn't say this shit to me
if you were a real friend.

1039
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.666
People don't pay
to see Reginald Dwight.

1040
01:14:04.668 --> 01:14:07.170
They pay to see Elton John!

1041
01:14:07.172 --> 01:14:10.341
Don't ever tell me
how to do my fucking job!

1042
01:14:17.315 --> 01:14:18.350
Break a leg.

1043
01:14:21.186 --> 01:14:22.718
You don't have
to put up with this, Reg.

1044
01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.955
Write the fucking lyrics,
Bernie!

1045
01:14:25.656 --> 01:14:27.392
Let me deal with the rest.

1046
01:14:33.063 --> 01:14:34.596
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

1047
01:14:34.598 --> 01:14:37.032
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

1048
01:14:37.034 --> 01:14:41.303

1060
01:15:58.082 --> 01:16:01.318
- Where am I?
- At your house in LA, Mr. John.

1061
01:16:03.254 --> 01:16:04.288
Right.

1062
01:16:05.556 --> 01:16:07.057
I'll put some coffee on.

1063
01:16:15.832 --> 01:16:18.833
Darling, I've been thinking,
maybe we should quit the booze

1064
01:16:18.835 --> 01:16:21.372
for a couple of days,
take some quality time together...

1065
01:16:23.073 --> 01:16:24.308
Afternoon.

1066
01:16:25.775 --> 01:16:27.011
Mr. Reid.

1067
01:16:32.649 --> 01:16:34.750
- What are you doing, John?
- Just a bit of rock 'n' roll.

1068
01:16:34.752 --> 01:16:37.588
Rock 'n' roll is not shagging your
secretary in front of the pool boys!

1069
01:16:37.887 --> 01:16:40.457
Rock 'n' roll is getting you
out of your bed in the morning.

1070
01:16:40.691 --> 01:16:43.592
Arranging 250 gigs
in 26 different countries.

1071
01:16:43.594 --> 01:16:46.463
Rock 'n' roll's actually
112 employment contracts,

1072
01:16:46.697 --> 01:16:48.497
insurance, copyright indemnity,

1073
01:16:48.499 --> 01:16:50.632
renegotiating your
previously insane contracts

1074
01:16:50.634 --> 01:16:52.200
and wiping your arse.

1075
01:16:52.202 --> 01:16:54.269
You know, all you do, Elton,
is play the piano.

1076
01:16:54.271 --> 01:16:57.405
But for me, rock 'n' roll is an 87
million-dollar-a-year industry.

1077
01:16:57.407 --> 01:17:00.109
Maybe I just play the piano,
but you know what else I do?

1078
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:02.845
Hmm? I pay, John.

1079
01:17:03.646 --> 01:17:04.881
For everything.

1080
01:17:05.214 --> 01:17:07.417
Including this house,
which I'd like you to leave now.

1081
01:17:07.817 --> 01:17:11.118
You may still be my manager,
but you and me are finished.

1082
01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.120
- You're so predictable.
- No, not predictable.

1083
01:17:13.122 --> 01:17:14.690
I want to be by myself,

1084
01:17:14.692 --> 01:17:18.193
not with some asshole
who doesn't give a shit about me

1085
01:17:18.195 --> 01:17:21.164
and takes the piss
day after day!

1086
01:17:21.431 --> 01:17:23.930
- Get out!
- Yoo-hoo!

1087
01:17:23.932 --> 01:17:25.501
Elton.

1088
01:17:26.769 --> 01:17:28.102
What are they doing here?

1089
01:17:28.104 --> 01:17:29.403
You told me to hire a jet

1090
01:17:29.405 --> 01:17:30.741
and fly them over
for the gig.

1091
01:17:31.407 --> 01:17:34.542
- No, no, next week, John.
- It is next week.

1092
01:17:34.544 --> 01:17:36.277
I'm gonna go
and fetch them a drink.

1093
01:17:36.279 --> 01:17:37.978
Darling, why don't you
clean yourself up,

1094
01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:39.347
because you fucking stink.

1095
01:17:39.349 --> 01:17:42.919
Sheila! It's been too long.

1096
01:17:43.386 --> 01:17:45.985
- Beautiful woman.
- Hello, look at this, you lovely lot.

1097
01:17:45.987 --> 01:17:47.323
- Here we are.
- Hi, Nan.

1098
01:17:48.056 --> 01:17:51.192
- I can't believe I'm actually in America.
- I know.

1099
01:17:51.194 --> 01:17:52.914
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing? Good to see you.

1100
01:17:53.129 --> 01:17:54.695
- Elton.
- Hello, Mum.

1101
01:17:54.697 --> 01:17:57.298
Elton, darling,
you remember the Andersons

1102
01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.533
- from next door, don't you?
- Yes, the Andersons.

1103
01:17:59.535 --> 01:18:01.337
How could we forget
the Andersons?

1104
01:18:01.637 --> 01:18:02.872
- Hello.
- Hello.

1105
01:18:04.907 --> 01:18:07.810
And what a shy little boy
you were.

1106
01:18:08.076 --> 01:18:09.610
Look at you now.

1107
01:18:09.612 --> 01:18:11.978
Elton, you must
give them a tour.

1108
01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:13.381
- Yes, right now, go on.
- Yeah, okay.

1109
01:18:13.383 --> 01:18:15.115
Everyone,
Elton is giving a tour.

1110
01:18:15.117 --> 01:18:17.884
- Mum, you're on my gown.
- Don't be rude.

1111
01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.397
Here we go.
Come here, come here. Excited?

1112
01:18:28.197 --> 01:18:29.432
- Car.
- Yeah.

1113
01:18:32.968 --> 01:18:35.870
- Bernie, how's it going, man?
- Hey, man. How's it going?

1114
01:18:35.872 --> 01:18:37.640
No idea who he is.
Of course.

1115
01:18:53.489 --> 01:18:54.624
Here he is!

1116
01:18:55.057 --> 01:18:56.956
Ladies, Elton.

1117
01:18:56.958 --> 01:18:58.026
- Hey.
- Hey.

1118
01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:01.027
What are you
doing on your own up here?

1119
01:19:01.029 --> 01:19:02.462
Miserable bastard.

1120
01:19:02.464 --> 01:19:04.164
You're missing
all the fun downstairs.

1121
01:19:04.166 --> 01:19:06.065
Well, as long as all the fun
isn't missing me,

1122
01:19:06.067 --> 01:19:07.936
then who gives a shit, Bernie?

1123
01:19:11.641 --> 01:19:12.675
We should get a drink.

1124
01:19:13.543 --> 01:19:16.410
- No, we should. Let's go get a drink.
- Come on, it's fine.

1125
01:19:16.412 --> 01:19:19.012
No, we absolutely should.
No, I'm telling you...

1126
01:19:19.014 --> 01:19:21.550
Yeah, go and get
a little drink.

1127
01:19:54.316 --> 01:19:56.249
You look amazing.

1128
01:19:56.251 --> 01:19:58.819
Fucking prick.

1129
01:20:10.998 --> 01:20:13.133
For my next trick,

1130
01:20:15.303 --> 01:20:17.272

kill myself.

- Elton.
- Yes, sorry. You were saying?

1164
01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:55.715
I was saying
that I think I need a break.

1165
01:24:56.048 --> 01:24:58.249
You need to take a break?

1166
01:24:58.251 --> 01:25:01.788
I think that I just need
to go and sort myself out a bit.

1167
01:25:04.257 --> 01:25:05.456
What?

1168
01:25:05.458 --> 01:25:09.028
I'm going home... for a while.

1169
01:25:09.729 --> 01:25:11.063
Well, that's nice for you.

1170
01:25:11.497 --> 01:25:15.668
Why can't we just, you know,
both of us just disappear together?

1171
01:25:18.905 --> 01:25:19.939
My ranch.

1172
01:25:20.305 --> 01:25:22.208
We'll go to my ranch,
we'll hide away.

1173
01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.543
We can write like we did.

1174
01:25:26.245 --> 01:25:27.747
Like we used to.

1175
01:25:28.581 --> 01:25:31.083
We should go home, Elton.

1176
01:25:32.218 --> 01:25:33.553
Reconnect.

1177
01:25:38.391 --> 01:25:39.692
No, you should go.

1178
01:25:41.128 --> 01:25:43.762
There are other writers
I'd like to work with anyway.

1179
01:25:44.663 --> 01:25:48.067
Do me good.
Collaborate with other people.

1180
01:25:49.601 --> 01:25:51.103
I think
it's a really good idea.

Or wherever the hell we are.

1185
01:26:32.110 --> 01:26:35.346
Well, if you don't like it, go home.

1186
01:26:35.348 --> 01:26:37.847
It's what everyone else
seems to be doing at the moment.

1187
01:26:40.219 --> 01:26:44.422

01:29:35.726 --> 01:29:37.961
Why don't you get back in
the studio you're paying for?

1223
01:29:39.364 --> 01:29:43.033
Why don't you sell my fucking records?
What's this? Hmm?

1224
01:29:43.566 --> 01:29:45.267
Number 11 in Italy.

1225
01:29:45.269 --> 01:29:47.568
The song doesn't work,
that's the problem.

1226
01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:49.371
The record's
coked-out MOR shit.

1227
01:29:49.373 --> 01:29:50.374
No, the problem...

1228
01:29:50.941 --> 01:29:55.012
is you have
never understood me...

1229
01:29:55.579 --> 01:29:57.281
and what I have to go through.

1230
01:29:57.614 --> 01:29:59.781
And you know what?
I should've sacked you when you left me.

1231
01:29:59.783 --> 01:30:02.918
I am glad I left you.
It means I can maintain some objectivity

1232
01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.587
in your self-indulgent,
myopic little world.

1233
01:30:05.589 --> 01:30:08.092
Get in the studio
and make some music or don't.

1234
01:30:08.392 --> 01:30:09.625
I don't care.

1235
01:30:14.597 --> 01:30:16.632
Well, you will
when your money runs out.

1236
01:30:19.903 --> 01:30:23.071
Do your worst.
In fact, take me to court.

1237
01:30:23.073 --> 01:30:25.275
You signed contracts
with me years ago.

1238
01:30:25.543 --> 01:30:29.380
So I'll still be collecting my 20%
long after you've killed yourself.

1239
01:30:30.613 --> 01:30:32.516
Get out of my fucking house!

1240

I know.

1280
01:35:02.883 --> 01:35:04.652
Renate didn't deserve that.

1281

She's a good person.

1282
01:35:11.292 --> 01:35:13.395

make you happy?

1284
01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:19.699

01:35:25.172 --> 01:35:27.340

- Hello, Mum.

1286
01:35:27.342 --> 01:35:29.908
- Sir, would you like me to...
- Maybe a bit later, thank you.

1287
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:31.379
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.

1288
01:35:31.912 --> 01:35:33.146
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good.

1289
01:35:33.148 --> 01:35:35.950
Just talking about poor Renate.

1290
01:35:36.818 --> 01:35:38.153
Such a lovely woman.

1291
01:35:38.453 --> 01:35:40.655
Divorce can be so painful.

1292
01:35:41.489 --> 01:35:44.089
- Yeah.
- Anyway, celebration is in order.

1293
01:35:46.026 --> 01:35:50.061
We found a lovely villa
by the sea.

1294
01:35:50.063 --> 01:35:51.731
It'd be good if you would
talk to John today,

1295
01:35:51.733 --> 01:35:54.634
get the money arranged.
Can't risk losing this one.

1296
01:35:54.636 --> 01:35:56.202
Yeah, in Minorca.

1297
01:35:56.204 --> 01:35:57.503
It is a lovely place.
You should see it.

1298
01:35:57.505 --> 01:35:59.707
- Minorca, eh?
- Mmm.

1299
01:36:01.876 --> 01:36:03.545
What do you want
to go there for?

1300
01:36:04.045 --> 01:36:06.077
- Because you're driving me away.
- Mmm.

1301
01:36:06.079 --> 01:36:08.046
Every time
we open a paper,

1302
01:36:08.048 --> 01:36:10.984
there's something about you and
the booze or the drugs, and...

1303
01:36:11.753 --> 01:36:13.753
you're breaking
your poor mum's heart.

1304
01:36:13.755 --> 01:36:15.755
Tell you what,
I'll write you a check. Hmm?

1305
01:36:15.757 --> 01:36:17.422
So she can go buy a new one.

1306
01:36:17.424 --> 01:36:19.794
Typical that you'd say
something like that about me,

1307
01:36:20.127 --> 01:36:22.060
when I've given up
so much for you.

1308
01:36:22.062 --> 01:36:23.763
What have you given up for me?

1309
01:36:23.765 --> 01:36:27.235
Your father... for a start.

1310
01:36:32.072 --> 01:36:34.308
You really are
a heartless monster.

1311
01:36:38.679 --> 01:36:41.215
You know, I don't live my life
in black and white.

1312
01:36:42.884 --> 01:36:46.521
And I do not want your fucked-up,
frigid ideas about anything.

1313
01:36:50.324 --> 01:36:52.792
You know, I am so sick

1314
01:36:52.794 --> 01:36:54.561
of running away from who I am.

1315
01:36:56.763 --> 01:36:59.931
There's nothing wrong
with success. Or pleasure.

1316
01:36:59.933 --> 01:37:01.299
In fact,
why am I apologizing for it?

1317
01:37:01.301 --> 01:37:03.770
Mum, I have fucked
everything that moves.

1318
01:37:05.372 --> 01:37:08.173
And I've taken
every drug known to man.

1319
01:37:08.175 --> 01:37:09.409
All of them.

1320
01:37:10.745 --> 01:37:11.779
Do you know what?

1321
01:37:13.681 --> 01:37:15.449
I enjoyed
every last minute of it.

1322
01:37:15.850 --> 01:37:18.617
Ever since you first dangled
your fat little legs

1323
01:37:18.619 --> 01:37:20.487
in front of a piano,
you've been lucky.

1324
01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:24.422
You've never worked hard
for a bloody thing in your life.

1325
01:37:24.424 --> 01:37:26.992
It all just comes to you.
You don't do anything.

1326
01:37:26.994 --> 01:37:29.027
And I'm the one who suffers.

1327
01:37:29.029 --> 01:37:31.263

have had children.

1328
01:37:31.265 --> 01:37:35.669

how do you expect anyone else to?

01:39:56.909 --> 01:40:00.511
- you weren't there.
- It's not weak to ask for help.

1361
01:40:00.513 --> 01:40:03.649
I have worked my balls off
to get us out of the shit.

1362
01:40:04.483 --> 01:40:07.918
Day in, day out, for years.

1363
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.554
And now it's me that can't
walk down the streets.

1364
01:40:10.556 --> 01:40:13.926
It's me
who doesn't have a life.

1365
01:40:14.727 --> 01:40:17.594
'Cause I don't get to sit
around with my feet on a desk,

1366
01:40:17.596 --> 01:40:19.530
chewing on the end
of a fucking pencil.

1367
01:40:19.532 --> 01:40:21.932
"Write the lyrics, Bernie.
I'll take care of everything else."

1368
01:40:21.934 --> 01:40:23.335
That was a test!

1369
01:40:26.073 --> 01:40:27.206
You should've known.

1370
01:40:27.773 --> 01:40:29.542

- Enjoy.

1425
01:46:04.474 --> 01:46:08.244
Yeah, but I started
acting like a cunt in 1975.

1426
01:46:10.846 --> 01:46:12.315
I just forgot to stop.

1427
01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:19.555
I do feel ashamed.

1428
01:46:21.824 --> 01:46:25.796
Spent so long feeling resentful
for things that just don't matter.

1429
01:46:33.002 --> 01:46:35.171
Maybe I should've tried
to be more ordinary.

1430
01:46:41.677 --> 01:46:42.912
Hello, Nan.

1431
01:46:43.712 --> 01:46:45.748
You was never ordinary.

1432
01:46:46.749 --> 01:46:47.983
Look at you.

1433
01:46:48.984 --> 01:46:52.255
In here, talking
about your feelings.

1434
01:46:53.056 --> 01:46:54.988
What a waste of time.

1435
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:57.993
Mum, I know it was never easy.

1436
01:46:58.694 --> 01:47:00.329
And I hope you can forgive me.

1437
01:47:02.131 --> 01:47:04.733
Because I've realized
that's what we need to do now.

1438
01:47:05.835 --> 01:47:07.603
Forgive each other.

1439
01:47:09.506 --> 01:47:11.974
- No, your problem is you're selfish.
- No.

1440
01:47:12.975 --> 01:47:15.345
My problem was I believed
you loved me.

1441
01:47:15.611 --> 01:47:17.245
And you're incapable of it.

1442
01:47:17.247 --> 01:47:18.945
I gave everything
to keep something

1443
01:47:18.947 --> 01:47:20.748
that I never even had
in the first place.

1444
01:47:22.051 --> 01:47:24.854
I always thought you was
an introverted extrovert.

1445
01:47:25.521 --> 01:47:28.924
- A what?
- He's shy. He's always been shy.

1446
01:47:29.325 --> 01:47:30.993
It's all his father's fault.

1447
01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:35.197
Don't blame me.
He'd have been strange, regardless.

1448
01:47:35.798 --> 01:47:38.134
Actually, I think
I'm okay with "strange."

1449
01:47:38.634 --> 01:47:41.238
God. Not him.

1450
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:43.339
Both of you. Stop.

1451
01:47:43.938 --> 01:47:47.276
I'm not going to allow you to
talk to me like this anymore.

1452
01:47:49.111 --> 01:47:50.980
It's about time you said that.

1453
01:47:55.484 --> 01:47:56.719
Bernie.

1454
01:47:59.755 --> 01:48:01.488
I never told you
how much I need you.

1455
01:48:01.490 --> 01:48:03.359
No, no, no, I love you, man.

1456
01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.429
Always have, always will.

1457
01:48:08.963 --> 01:48:11.766
You write songs
that millions of people love.

1458
01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:13.569
And that's what's important.

1459
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:16.305
You just need to remember
who you are...

1460
01:48:17.772 --> 01:48:19.074
and be okay with it.

1461
01:48:19.608 --> 01:48:21.377
He doesn't know who he is.

1462
01:48:28.684 --> 01:48:29.984
Yes, I do.

1463
01:48:32.588 --> 01:48:34.355
I'm Elton Hercules John.

1464
01:48:35.957 --> 01:48:37.992
I thought
you were Reggie Dwight.

1465
01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:50.873
I haven't been
Reggie Dwight for years.

1466
01:49:05.153 --> 01:49:06.955
When are you going
to hug me?

1467
01:49:40.121 --> 01:49:42.290
Impressed you know
how to use one of those.

1468
01:49:46.893 --> 01:49:48.263
How you doing?

1469
01:49:49.964 --> 01:49:51.065
Good to see you.

1470
01:49:51.532 --> 01:49:54.135
Some days are tougher than
others, but I feel good.

1471
01:49:55.803 --> 01:49:57.305
They got a piano here?

1472
01:49:58.106 --> 01:49:59.939
- You been playing?
- Hmm...

1473
01:49:59.941 --> 01:50:01.407
- No.
- No?

1474
01:50:01.409 --> 01:50:03.512
Not in the right place
for that just now.

1475
01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:05.912
I'm scared, Bernie.

1476
01:50:09.883 --> 01:50:11.386
What if I'm not as good...

1477
01:50:13.954 --> 01:50:15.490
without the drink
and the drugs?

1478
01:50:19.227 --> 01:50:20.928
You know that's not true.

1479
01:50:22.630 --> 01:50:24.563
You're not scared
you're not good without it,

1480
01:50:24.565 --> 01:50:25.900
you're scared to feel again.

1481
01:50:26.501 --> 01:50:29.336
You might be able to lie to
yourself, but you can't lie to me.

1482
01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.876
I should be going.

1483
01:50:37.978 --> 01:50:39.213
Don't go.

1484
01:50:41.382 --> 01:50:42.383
Not yet.

1485
01:50:43.084 --> 01:50:44.918
This is the part
you gotta do on your own.

1486
01:50:46.521 --> 01:50:49.057
These... need music.

1487
01:50:59.433 --> 01:51:00.535

1488
01:51:04.971 --> 01:51:06.307
