1
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,859
On your left.

2
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:13,051
On your right.

3
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:21,245
You must check in
with your P.O. Once a week.

4
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:23,825
Your P.O. Is entitled
to visit at any time.

5
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:27,520
You cannot come
within 300 feet of...

6
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:31,339
You must register immediately
upon return...

7
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,500
- Walter?
- Hey, Bob.

8
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:29,526
It's good to see you.

9
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:32,281
That's Mary-Kay.

10
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:39,574
The only reason I'm doing this is 'cause
I know you did good work for my father.

11
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:42,372
So you be here on time.
You do your work.

12
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:44,945
I don't want
any kind of problem, period.

13
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:42,671
God, that looks awful.

14
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,571
Yeah.

15
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:49,538
Now, this looks good.

16
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:54,936
Want some? Homemade.

17
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:57,098
No, thanks.

18
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:00,723
You won't taste
a better chicken salad in town.

19
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,119
I said no, thank you.

20
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:10,952
I'm sorry. I got to get back to work.

21
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:46,219
- So, how are you adjusting?
- I'm adjusting okay.

22
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:49,617
- And your new apartment?
- Apartment's okay.

23
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,450
- How's the job?
- The job's okay.

24
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:56,297
Do I take "okay" to mean
you feel good about working there?

25
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,419
I said the job's okay.

26
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,300
That's right. You did.

27
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,675
- Vicki!
- Fuck you, asshole.

28
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:26,719
- Come on. What's wrong, huh?
- Kiss my ass.

29
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:44,307
Boy, you still think fast.

30
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,794
You don't need to think fast
to handle a beer.

31
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:50,132
Well, it took some talking
to convince your super I was a relative.

32
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:53,586
Yeah, well, I told her
all my relatives were good-looking.

33
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:55,849
- Jesus Christ, man, it's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

34
00:05:57,103 --> 00:05:58,627
You look good...

35
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:01,171
damn good,
considering you're an old man now.

36
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:04,733
Feels like the whole world's
gotten younger.

37
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:08,189
So, you're doing okay?

38
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:09,674
Yeah, I'm okay.

39
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,434
- How's business?
- Booming.

40
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:16,297
Can't keep up with the work.
In fact, I just hired a few new guys.

41
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:19,788
Just until, you know, we catch up.

42
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:32,051
Living across the street
from a grade school. Jesus.

43
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:35,003
Something wrong with that?

44
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:38,811
I'm just thinking of the noise.

45
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,973
It's the only landlord in town
who'll take my money.

46
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:49,051
So, how's Annette?

47
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,608
A little tense.

48
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,121
You know, you're the only member
of the family still speaking to me.

49
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:56,254
Yeah, well, I remember when
they all gave Annette shit...

50
00:06:56,271 --> 00:07:00,970
because she married the brown-skinned boy
from down the street... except her brother.

51
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,811
And what about Annette?

52
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:05,595
I'm workin' on it.

53
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:13,772
- So how old is Carla?
- She's gonna be 12 next week.

54
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:17,082
We're gonna throw her
a big party on Saturday.

55
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:21,055
I wish I could ask you to come.

56
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,954
Good enough
to eat today, baby.

57
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:55,568
Ooh, yeah.

58
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,467
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, huh?

59
00:07:57,487 --> 00:08:00,752
How'd you like it if someone did
that shit to your sister, huh?

60
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:02,619
Piece of shit!

61
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:08,320
Fuck off!
Clean that shit up!

62
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,808
- Oh, yeah.
- Play with yourself, asshole!

63
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:27,995
You okay?

64
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:29,983
What?

65
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:33,662
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.

66
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,346
So, what'd he do?

67
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:59,807
- What did who do?
- You know, the new guy.

68
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,257
Drugs, armed robbery,
manslaughter...

69
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:07,599
Mind your business, Mary-Kay.

70
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:13,559
<i>Have you made any friends there?</i>

71
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,574
<i>I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.</i>

72
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,996
<i>You seem a little hostile today.</i>

73
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,859
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.

74
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,076
No need to call me doctor.
I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.

75
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,844
It's all the same to me.

76
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:30,434
Walter, I'd like you
to try something for me.

77
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:33,111
- What's that?
- I'd like you to keep a journal.

78
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:35,594
- No fuckin' way.
- Why not?

79
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:38,086
Evidence.

80
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:41,220
Perhaps a journal would
encourage you to reflect.

81
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:45,148
Try it?

82
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,264
Sixteen, 17, 18, 19, 20.

83
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:21,197
320 feet.

84
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,026
How about that?

85
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,858
Want a ride?

86
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,920
- I'm all right.
- It's fucking freezing out here.

87
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:34,812
- I'm fine.
- Come on. I won't bite.

88
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:02,220
Something wrong
with this picture.

89
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,281
Here's this nice, hard-working guy...

90
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:06,702
suddenly appears out of the blue.

91
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:08,728
Takes the bus to and from work.

92
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,650
I mean, who takes
the bus anymore?

93
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:14,074
People who don't have cars.

94
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:18,466
- It's very weird.
- Not as weird as a sharp, young...

95
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,414
good-looking woman
working in a lumberyard.

96
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,330
Oh, yeah?
What's weird about that?

97
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,045
Most women wouldn't choose it.

98
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,800
Guess I'm not like most women.

99
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:41,754
You never spoke to me before.

100
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,185
I thought you were a dyke.

101
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:55,003
- Are you?
- What do you think?

102
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,130
You plan on drinking
both those beers?

103
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,265
I'm sorry.

104
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:23,901
- Is that a school?
- K through sixth.

105
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,820
Doesn't it get noisy?

106
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,665
I like the noise.

107
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:43,689
I used to think you were shy...

108
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:45,321
but now I think it's something else.

109
00:13:47,822 --> 00:13:49,722
What?

110
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:53,940
- Something happened to you.
- Yeah?

111
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:55,862
I'm not easily shocked.

112
00:13:57,326 --> 00:13:59,226
I get that impression.

113
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:06,165
So, you gonna tell me your dark secret?

114
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:07,593
Why do you want to know?

115
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,598
Don't you think I should know
before we have sex?

116
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,850
I don't like to waste time.

117
00:14:21,582 --> 00:14:23,846
So, you gonna tell me
your deep, dark secret?

118
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:29,901
No.

119
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:33,434
Okay.

120
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:45,932
So, you're not a dyke.

121
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,858
Not tonight.

122
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:54,558
Hey, that was intense.

123
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,629
You're still here.

124
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:00,538
I didn't say I didn't like it.

125
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,530
What are you doing?

126
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,643
This table's a heavy little bitch, man.

127
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:47,145
It's cherry.

128
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,761
This wood. It's cherry.

129
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:52,666
It's a nice table.

130
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:55,280
It's my own design. You're not gonna
find another one like it in the world.

131
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,145
- It was a beautiful gift.
- So, why are you giving it back to me?

132
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:00,287
Because, man, you need a table.

133
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:04,398
Carlos, I made this table for you
and Annette as a wedding present.

134
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,461
- I put a lot into it.
- I know, man.

135
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:10,938
I love the table too.
But I also love my wife.

136
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:12,762
Hey, you got a beer?

137
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:40,200
<i>"I watch the kids arrive at school.</i>

138
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:47,266
<i>But for the last few weeks,
I've noticed someone else watching them.</i>

139
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:01,242
<i>I call him Candy. "</i>

140
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:54,489
She's at the top
of her class at school.

141
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:56,346
How about your kids?

142
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:57,833
- They're good.
- Yeah?

143
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,337
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

144
00:18:59,374 --> 00:19:02,309
She's really doing great at school.

145
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:04,185
I don't see her much, but...

146
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:14,167
- I'd keep away from him.
- What?

147
00:19:14,126 --> 00:19:16,219
The new guy.

148
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,636
I'd keep away from him
if I were you.

149
00:19:18,638 --> 00:19:22,096
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- I think he's damaged goods...

150
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:24,186
real damaged.

151
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:27,369
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do.

152
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,131
Thanks a bunch for the advice.

153
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,849
Suit yourself.

154
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:53,150
Close, but no ciggy.

155
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:02,409
Thanks, babe.

156
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,337
Thank you.

157
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,820
Hey, Walter.

158
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:20,095
Hello.

159
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,217
Hello.

160
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,097
You okay?

161
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,283
Walter, what did you do?

162
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,786
What happened to you?

163
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:49,896
Walter?

164
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,506
Why do you want to know?

165
00:21:58,894 --> 00:22:00,828
Because I like you.

166
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:11,740
What's the worst thing
you ever did?

167
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:14,938
The worst?

168
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:19,305
I fucked my best friend's husband.

169
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:25,178
I mean, my best friend
since second grade.

170
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:31,531
He had the hots for me and...
Yeah, he was cute.

171
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:34,863
We'd get it on for days.

172
00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:37,421
And then he told her... the shit.

173
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,823
Broke up their marriage.
Ruined our friendship.

174
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:45,038
I still feel like the lowest piece of shit
when I think about that.

175
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:50,494
So, what did you do?

176
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:55,523
I molested little girls.

177
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:10,332
Twelve years in prison is no joke.

178
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,857
How young?

179
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:37,289
Between 10 and 12.

180
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,217
Once a nine-year-old
told me she was 11.

181
00:23:40,237 --> 00:23:42,637
Once a 14-year-old
told me she was 12.

182
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:45,812
I always asked
how old they were.

183
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:53,146
What did you do to them?

184
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,250
It's not what you think.

185
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:01,337
I never hurt them.

186
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,457
Never.

187
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,461
Look...

188
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:14,404
I want you to go now, all right?

189
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,564
I told you
I'm not easily shocked.

190
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:23,446
Yeah, well, you should be shocked.

191
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,166
- Or do you get off on this shit?
- What?

192
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:33,181
<i>When will I be normal?</i>

193
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,292
<i>We have a lot of work to do.</i>

194
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,370
<i>- Will I ever be normal?
- What's your idea of being normal?</i>

195
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:41,116
What's your idea
of being a fuckin' shrink?

196
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,610
- Sorry.
- Watch where you're going.

197
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,598
Sorry.

198
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:22,860
So what's happening?

199
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:25,225
Braves are kicking the shit
out of the Phillies.

200
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,993
Fucking Phillies.

201
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:31,924
It's just the beginning of the season.
You got to give them a chance.

202
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:42,841
- So, how was the party?
- What party?

203
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,453
- The birthday party.
- Fuck. It was great.

204
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:47,715
You should have seen Carla.
She was so pretty.

205
00:26:47,757 --> 00:26:50,225
She looked like a princess.

206
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:52,051
She's the light of my life, man.

207
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,130
You don't want
to love them too much though.

208
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,119
No such thing, man.
I couldn't love her enough.

209
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:02,471
Oh, I've got photos.
You want to see?

210
00:27:02,478 --> 00:27:04,378
- Nah, it's all right.
- Ah, come on.

211
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:07,094
I don't want to see
any goddamn pictures, all right?

212
00:27:08,557 --> 00:27:11,458
They're just photos
I took at the party.

213
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:15,931
Carlos, I want to see my sister
and my niece in person.

214
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,352
Okay?

215
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,090
Yeah, okay.

216
00:27:24,718 --> 00:27:26,879
<i>I'm just saying Carlos
has a thing for his daughter.</i>

217
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:28,793
<i>If he's not careful, he's gonna suffer.</i>

218
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,767
You think I'm crazy?

219
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,450
Do you think you're crazy?

220
00:27:39,054 --> 00:27:42,353
You know, talking to you is like riding
on a fuckin' merry-go-round.

221
00:27:42,317 --> 00:27:44,444
That's a marvellous image, Walter.

222
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:48,922
Because by going in circles we find things
we missed the first time around.

223
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:55,434
When will I be normal?

224
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,202
<i>"So what should I do?</i>

225
00:28:44,205 --> 00:28:46,105
<i>Call the cops?</i>

226
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,616
<i>Yeah, that's pretty funny.</i>

227
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:52,467
<i>But what if Candy seduces one
to go for a ride?</i>

228
00:28:54,253 --> 00:28:56,221
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

229
00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:59,687
<i>If the boy goes for a ride...</i>

230
00:28:59,693 --> 00:29:01,991
<i>it's because he wants
to go for a ride. "</i>

231
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:28,505
Walter.

232
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:30,516
Cop.

233
00:29:30,574 --> 00:29:33,634
Sergeant Lucas.
You mind if I come in?

234
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:35,080
You are in.

235
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:39,630
Yeah, I am.
But I always like to ask.

236
00:29:39,597 --> 00:29:42,361
It's a force of habit.
You don't mind if I look around, do you?

237
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,817
I would.

238
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:49,073
Why, you got something to hide?

239
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,594
Doesn't everybody?

240
00:29:53,518 --> 00:29:55,816
Have a seat.

241
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:04,392
I could get a search warrant.

242
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:08,158
Yeah, if you could get a search warrant,
you would have brought one today.

243
00:30:14,061 --> 00:30:15,926
This cherry?

244
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,140
Yeah.

245
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:25,056
It's a little unusual design
for a contemporary piece, but...

246
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:37,107
Walter...

247
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:43,098
two nights ago a 10-year-old girl
got attacked not far from here.

248
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,441
That's a bit of a coincidence,
don't you think?

249
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:49,278
- What time did it happen?
- I'll ask the questions.

250
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:51,661
If you tell me what time
it happened, maybe I could...

251
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:53,788
Get your hands out
of your fuckin' pockets!

252
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:59,610
Sit down!

253
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,521
I know every fuckin' move
you make...

254
00:31:19,757 --> 00:31:22,021
every goddamn step.

255
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:23,997
When you sleep, when you eat...

256
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:26,948
when you shit, when you jack off...

257
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:28,859
When you're sitting there
by the window...

258
00:31:28,877 --> 00:31:31,812
watching the little girls
in their cotton white dresses...

259
00:31:31,821 --> 00:31:34,722
and you're sittin' there on your little
jack-off bench, and you're jackin' off.

260
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:36,601
Do you show your cock
to little girls when you jack off?

261
00:31:36,621 --> 00:31:38,919
- You can't talk to me like...
- Like what?

262
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:42,361
Like a piece of shit? That's what
you are to me, a piece of shit.

263
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,250
Throw you out
that window right now.

264
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,170
Think somebody's gonna miss you?

265
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,841
I could say you jumped
when I came in.

266
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:53,401
Who you think
they're gonna believe, me or you?

267
00:31:53,421 --> 00:31:55,912
You'd just be a dead piece of shit.

268
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:05,980
We need to make sure...

269
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:08,054
that you're being
a good boy, Walter.

270
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:10,077
Okay?

271
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:12,352
- Okay?
- Okay.

272
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,864
Okay.

273
00:32:16,205 --> 00:32:17,672
Okay.

274
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:20,889
Have a good day.

275
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:24,500
Nice table.

276
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:26,222
Yes, may I help you, please?

277
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:48,910
- What did you think would happen?
- I don't know.

278
00:34:48,877 --> 00:34:50,970
- What did you want to happen?
- I don't know!

279
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:55,401
Would you please stop writing
in the fucking pad?

280
00:34:56,781 --> 00:35:00,342
You know that if anything happens to me,
I go back to prison.

281
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:02,599
No parole. No nothin'. For life.

282
00:35:02,605 --> 00:35:04,334
- Is this the first one?
- Of course it is!

283
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:06,959
- Why do you think I'm telling you?
- I want you to calm down.

284
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,382
You followed a girl.

285
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:15,569
Perhaps you wanted to see
what it felt like after so many years.

286
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:19,940
Maybe subconsciously
you were testing yourself.

287
00:35:21,645 --> 00:35:24,045
And here you are...

288
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:27,014
talking about it with me.

289
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:29,287
This is positive.

290
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,510
Walter, we'll pick up here
next week.

291
00:35:45,805 --> 00:35:48,296
Remember when
you asked me what...

292
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,494
my idea of normal was?

293
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:53,993
Normal is when I can see a girl...

294
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:56,124
be near a girl, even talk to a girl...

295
00:35:58,061 --> 00:35:59,961
and not think about...

296
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:06,041
That's my idea of normal.

297
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:41,849
What are you lookin' at?

298
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:09,350
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

299
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:11,486
A plant. I don't need a plant.

300
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:13,366
Everyone needs a plant.

301
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:17,301
This ivy is one tough baby.

302
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:19,591
It's a cutting from one of mine.

303
00:38:19,596 --> 00:38:21,154
So, here's the deal.

304
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:23,097
Give it a little water...

305
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:25,244
go easy on the direct sunlight...

306
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,252
and notice it
every once in a while.

307
00:38:28,236 --> 00:38:30,500
They love it when you look at 'em
or touch their leaves.

308
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,880
Think you can handle that?

309
00:38:41,228 --> 00:38:42,695
Such an asshole.

310
00:38:45,612 --> 00:38:47,079
Thanks.

311
00:38:50,253 --> 00:38:52,153
Want to go for a ride?

312
00:38:53,421 --> 00:38:54,979
Sure.

313
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,386
Get your coat.

314
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,186
Why do you stay?

315
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:38,749
I see something in you,
something good.

316
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:42,058
You don't see it yet, but I do.

317
00:40:42,892 --> 00:40:45,292
You know, most people
say the odds are against me.

318
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:47,976
What odds?

319
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:51,129
Percentages...

320
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,049
for guys like me.

321
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:57,637
Most of us end up back there.

322
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:02,718
Well, most people don't know
what they're talking about.

323
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,701
You want to talk about odds?

324
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:09,625
Someday I'll tell you how I survived...

325
00:41:09,645 --> 00:41:11,909
as the only daughter
in a family with three sons.

326
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:16,581
Hell, maybe you should
tell me now.

327
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,457
Maybe not.

328
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,377
You scared?

329
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:27,803
I got poked around
here and there.

330
00:41:28,845 --> 00:41:30,904
Jesus. Which brother?

331
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:35,541
All three, in chronological order.

332
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:39,962
Why are you telling me this?

333
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:46,102
I'm trying to tell you who I am,
if you're interested.

334
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,873
You must hate your brothers.

335
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:52,792
- I love my brothers.
- No, you don't.

336
00:41:56,493 --> 00:41:58,393
I love all of them.

337
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:03,421
They're strong, gentle men
with families of their own.

338
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:09,455
If you ever asked them about what they did
to me, they'd beat the shit out of you.

339
00:42:09,421 --> 00:42:11,685
And they'd call you a fucking liar.

340
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,160
Hey...

341
00:42:19,213 --> 00:42:21,306
I never told anyone that before.

342
00:43:01,452 --> 00:43:03,420
Yeah, he's right there.

343
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:16,596
Hey, Jim.

344
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,839
Yeah. Okay.

345
00:43:37,804 --> 00:43:40,432
I'll tell him. Bye-bye.

346
00:43:40,429 --> 00:43:41,953
Bob said you wanted to see me.

347
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:45,552
He wants everyone to sign
this card for Reggie.

348
00:43:48,813 --> 00:43:51,077
It's a baby girl.

349
00:43:51,116 --> 00:43:53,084
Reggie must be a happy man.

350
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:58,032
I heard you're lookin'
for another job.

351
00:43:58,028 --> 00:43:59,996
Where'd you hear that?

352
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:03,412
- Around.
- I'm not lookin' for another job.

353
00:44:03,405 --> 00:44:08,001
I just heard they're looking for some
good men down at Dan Shroeder's place.

354
00:44:10,893 --> 00:44:12,986
I like my job. Thank you.

355
00:45:09,836 --> 00:45:12,464
- So, I've got some good news.
- What's that?

356
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,428
Annette will see you.

357
00:45:15,788 --> 00:45:17,756
Aren't you glad?

358
00:45:19,372 --> 00:45:20,839
When?

359
00:45:20,877 --> 00:45:23,107
Early July.

360
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:29,520
- That's three months from now.
- It's a better time.

361
00:45:29,484 --> 00:45:32,214
Carla will be away at camp.
House'll be quiet.

362
00:45:32,204 --> 00:45:33,967
It's better when it's quiet.

363
00:45:33,996 --> 00:45:37,159
- Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
- Now, come on, Walter.

364
00:45:37,132 --> 00:45:39,600
You should see my appointment book.
It just got crazy.

365
00:45:39,596 --> 00:45:42,394
- It isn't what you think.
- Isn't it?

366
00:45:43,628 --> 00:45:46,426
Look, the important thing
is that you and Annette talk.

367
00:45:46,412 --> 00:45:49,870
She needs to see you,
and you need to see her.

368
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:54,329
I'm not a monster.

369
00:45:55,564 --> 00:45:57,464
Hey.

370
00:45:57,484 --> 00:46:01,147
So next week, Annette's gonna
be away for a few days, right?

371
00:46:01,132 --> 00:46:03,896
And the thing is,
when Annette's away...

372
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:05,852
I get horny as hell for other women.

373
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:08,564
I mean, I fantasize about
fucking some beautiful woman.

374
00:46:08,556 --> 00:46:10,615
You don't have to tell me this.

375
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:13,105
I know. I'm just sayin' I understand.

376
00:46:14,924 --> 00:46:20,226
It's crazy out there. I mean,
girls wearing mini-this, mini-that...

377
00:46:20,108 --> 00:46:23,339
Sometimes when I walk down the street
and I pass a sexy-looking woman...

378
00:46:23,308 --> 00:46:25,276
she makes me feel
like I'm bothering her.

379
00:46:25,293 --> 00:46:28,023
Hey, I see a pretty lady, I look.

380
00:46:28,044 --> 00:46:30,478
That's the price of beauty, my friend.

381
00:46:30,476 --> 00:46:34,003
You wouldn't believe the things Carla
and her friends are wearin' these days.

382
00:46:38,508 --> 00:46:42,535
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

383
00:46:46,636 --> 00:46:48,103
You ever have...

384
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:50,765
feelings for Carla?

385
00:46:51,756 --> 00:46:53,280
What do you mean?

386
00:46:53,324 --> 00:46:57,158
You know, feelings.

387
00:46:59,788 --> 00:47:04,384
Look, man, I ain't got your sick fuckin'...
Disease? Is that what it is?

388
00:47:04,332 --> 00:47:06,823
Whatever the fuck it is,
I ain't got it.

389
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,057
So if you ever touch
my daughter, I'll kill you.

390
00:47:34,956 --> 00:47:37,254
<i>When I say the word "girl"...</i>

391
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,094
<i>what is the earliest image
you can remember?</i>

392
00:47:41,037 --> 00:47:44,336
<i>When I say the word "pretty,"
when I say the word "pleasure"...</i>

393
00:47:46,412 --> 00:47:48,505
<i>who do you see?</i>

394
00:47:54,508 --> 00:47:56,476
I see my sister.

395
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,007
Where is she?

396
00:48:01,388 --> 00:48:05,347
She's asleep in my bedroom.

397
00:48:05,324 --> 00:48:07,792
Where are you?

398
00:48:07,788 --> 00:48:10,313
I'm in my bed too.

399
00:48:14,989 --> 00:48:17,287
How old are you and your sister?

400
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:22,404
Oh, about six.

401
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:25,868
That would make her four.

402
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:30,906
What are you doing?

403
00:48:30,892 --> 00:48:34,521
Nothin'. Takin' a nap.

404
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:37,604
- A nap?
- Yeah, a nap.

405
00:48:37,612 --> 00:48:40,137
Kids take naps.
You ever take a nap, Rosen?

406
00:48:40,172 --> 00:48:43,767
I don't wanna talk about this.
What the hell are you doin' back there?

407
00:48:43,724 --> 00:48:45,954
Did you and your sister
often take naps...

408
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,262
I want you back in your chair. Now!

409
00:48:50,732 --> 00:48:52,324
I'm sorry.

410
00:48:52,364 --> 00:48:54,696
I don't like nobody behind my back.

411
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:01,676
Walter, what did you do
while taking naps with your sister?

412
00:49:03,852 --> 00:49:05,319
Nothin'.

413
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:09,315
Did you touch her?
Did you take her clothes off?

414
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:11,385
- You take your clothes off?
- This is bullshit.

415
00:49:11,436 --> 00:49:13,495
I'm only asking questions.

416
00:49:17,964 --> 00:49:21,263
All right. I'm gonna tell you
just to shut you up.

417
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,747
I smelled her hair.

418
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:30,576
What else?

419
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:32,540
Nothin'.

420
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:34,023
That's it.

421
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,968
I just liked smellin' her hair.

422
00:49:39,244 --> 00:49:41,212
You felt pleasure?

423
00:49:45,036 --> 00:49:46,503
Yes.

424
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:51,109
- Did you get an erection?
- I was six years old.

425
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:54,542
I meant later,
when you two took naps...

426
00:49:56,524 --> 00:49:58,492
when the two of you
held each other...

427
00:49:58,508 --> 00:50:02,137
when you were 10 or 11,
and she was eight or nine...

428
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:07,407
when the two of you
were all alone...

429
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:10,341
completely alone in that big house.

430
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,673
It was a small house.

431
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,389
All right. A small house...

432
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:22,662
with small rooms.

433
00:50:32,044 --> 00:50:34,137
I smelled her hair.

434
00:50:35,628 --> 00:50:37,027
That's all.

435
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:43,212
I just liked smellin' her hair.

436
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:06,406
Hi.

437
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,212
Hello.

438
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,527
What are you looking at?

439
00:54:12,844 --> 00:54:15,074
Up in that oak tree
there's a nest.

440
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:17,416
- Where?
- Up there.

441
00:54:18,572 --> 00:54:21,541
- A little higher.
- There are little chicks.

442
00:54:21,515 --> 00:54:24,484
- You want to see?
- Sure.

443
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,024
They're starlings.

444
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:33,988
- Is that right?
- I don't like starlings.

445
00:54:33,964 --> 00:54:37,525
- Why not?
- They're extremely aggressive birds.

446
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,747
Plus their habits are pretty filthy.

447
00:54:40,524 --> 00:54:43,015
The mother must have her hands full.

448
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,488
So, you always carry these with you?

449
00:54:45,484 --> 00:54:47,452
When I go bird-watching.

450
00:54:47,468 --> 00:54:49,436
It's why I like coming here.

451
00:54:49,451 --> 00:54:51,351
It's just a city park.

452
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,340
You'd be surprised
how many kinds of birds you find here.

453
00:54:54,316 --> 00:54:56,443
Last week, I saw a purple martin...

454
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,156
and the week before that,
I saw a solitary vireo.

455
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,616
- That's rare.
- A solitary vireo?

456
00:55:02,604 --> 00:55:06,096
- I like that.
- Their sound is really musical.

457
00:55:08,107 --> 00:55:10,632
Are you a bird-watcher too?

458
00:55:10,636 --> 00:55:13,366
Me? No, I'm a...

459
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:15,323
more of a people-watcher.

460
00:55:16,524 --> 00:55:18,754
The way you were staring
at the tops of those trees...

461
00:55:18,763 --> 00:55:20,663
I thought you were
gonna take off and fly.

462
00:55:21,547 --> 00:55:23,344
I should go now.

463
00:55:23,372 --> 00:55:24,771
You come here a lot?

464
00:55:24,812 --> 00:55:26,677
My daddy likes me home
before dark.

465
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,972
- Well, it's good to listen to your dad.
- Bye.

466
00:55:49,131 --> 00:55:52,362
<i>Good morning, fellow sports fans.
The match is about to begin.</i>

467
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:54,732
<i>Candy enters the arena
looking sweet and trim.</i>

468
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:59,065
<i>He checks out the scene but plays it cool.
He's definitely holding back.</i>

469
00:55:58,987 --> 00:56:01,649
<i>Uh-oh. Candy's eyes
have locked on to something.</i>

470
00:56:01,644 --> 00:56:05,239
<i>Oh, yeah. A cherub lad has separated
himself from his friends.</i>

471
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:09,665
<i>Candy quickly makes his move.
He offers the boy a bag of treats.</i>

472
00:56:09,612 --> 00:56:11,079
<i>Round one to Candy.</i>

473
00:56:11,148 --> 00:56:13,810
<i>The cherub walks away.!</i>

474
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,431
<i>Round two goes to the cherub.</i>

475
00:56:15,468 --> 00:56:17,493
<i>Very risky move by Candy.</i>

476
00:56:17,516 --> 00:56:21,646
<i>I have never seen Candy act so cocky.</i>

477
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,946
<i>The cherub looks at Candy.
Cherub looks for his friends.</i>

478
00:56:24,651 --> 00:56:26,915
<i>But his friends are long gone.
The cherub is alone.</i>

479
00:56:26,923 --> 00:56:28,823
<i>The cherub crosses the street...</i>

480
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,320
<i>The cherub gets in the car.</i>

481
00:57:24,779 --> 00:57:29,079
- Hey, Walter.
- What can I do for you, Sergeant Lucas?

482
00:57:29,004 --> 00:57:31,529
You can listen to
my stories about Jesus.

483
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,141
Oh, no. This is too much.
This is too much sun.

484
00:57:41,132 --> 00:57:43,464
- What?
- This is ivy.

485
00:57:43,467 --> 00:57:45,458
These plants don't like
a lot of sunlight.

486
00:57:45,516 --> 00:57:47,416
Don't they grow outside?

487
00:57:47,436 --> 00:57:51,873
Yeah, they grow outside.
But outside they got trees to shade 'em.

488
00:57:51,788 --> 00:57:54,086
So now you're gonna take me
on a nature walk?

489
00:57:55,755 --> 00:57:57,848
Have a seat.

490
00:58:02,763 --> 00:58:04,856
So, yesterday you take
the 12 bus home...

491
00:58:04,876 --> 00:58:07,504
but you don't get off
at your regular stop.

492
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,468
You stay on.
Why'd you stay on?

493
00:58:09,483 --> 00:58:12,509
Fell asleep. When I woke up,
I was confused.

494
00:58:12,523 --> 00:58:15,287
I got off at the wrong stop,
and I walked home.

495
00:58:16,748 --> 00:58:18,443
You walked home?

496
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,287
Yeah.

497
00:58:28,395 --> 00:58:31,489
Some of these guys...

498
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:33,992
they walk right
into a family's house.

499
00:58:33,995 --> 00:58:35,986
Very...

500
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:38,946
It's very fuckin' ballsy.

501
00:58:38,924 --> 00:58:41,484
Had this one guy,
he's on death row...

502
00:58:41,483 --> 00:58:43,951
I'll call him Henry...

503
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,039
and he's tellin' me
about his last victim.

504
00:58:48,076 --> 00:58:50,306
She's a little...
little cutie named Adele.

505
00:58:50,315 --> 00:58:53,148
She's seven years old.

506
00:58:53,132 --> 00:58:58,195
And Adele's mother's got
the TV playing so loud...

507
00:58:58,091 --> 00:59:03,620
he can hear Letterman
tellin' jokes in the next room.

508
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:06,468
And he walks into Adele's room...

509
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:08,411
puts his hand over her mouth.

510
00:59:08,428 --> 00:59:12,387
He says, "If you scream, little girl,
I'm gonna kill your mother. "

511
00:59:12,332 --> 00:59:15,233
So, of course,
Adele doesn't scream.

512
00:59:15,243 --> 00:59:19,043
She doesn't cry.
She doesn't make a sound.

513
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:22,583
And Henry takes her by the hand.

514
00:59:24,011 --> 00:59:26,639
They walk out the front door.

515
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:33,697
Ten days later,
they find Adele's body...

516
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,078
what's left of it.

517
00:59:37,259 --> 00:59:39,227
You believe in fairy tales?

518
00:59:42,315 --> 00:59:44,215
Fairy tales?

519
00:59:44,235 --> 00:59:49,366
<i>Yeah, like, Alice in Wonderland and...</i>

520
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:52,518
No.

521
00:59:53,516 --> 00:59:56,041
Yeah. Yeah, me neither.

522
00:59:58,475 --> 01:00:02,377
What's the one with the woodsman?

523
01:00:02,315 --> 01:00:06,445
- Woodsman?
- Yeah. With the ax.

524
01:00:07,275 --> 01:00:09,266
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you know it.

525
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:12,124
The woodsman...
He cuts open a wolf's stomach.

526
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,975
The little girl comes out alive.

527
01:00:14,955 --> 01:00:17,116
<i>- Little Red Riding Hood.
- Little Red Riding Hood.</i>

528
01:00:17,131 --> 01:00:19,326
That's it. That's it.

529
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:23,308
The woodsman...
He cuts open the wolf's stomach.

530
01:00:23,276 --> 01:00:26,905
The girl comes out without a scratch.

531
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,229
You ever see a seven-year-old...

532
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,831
been sodomized in half?

533
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,774
She was so small...

534
01:00:51,627 --> 01:00:53,151
just broken.

535
01:00:55,211 --> 01:00:59,511
I saw 20-year vets on that job...
hard guys, man...

536
01:00:59,435 --> 01:01:02,063
and they just broke down and cried.

537
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:05,028
I was there. I cried.

538
01:01:17,611 --> 01:01:20,580
There ain't no fuckin' woodsman
in this world.

539
01:01:29,803 --> 01:01:34,103
I don't know why they keep
lettin' freaks like you out on the street.

540
01:01:34,027 --> 01:01:37,485
It just means that we gotta
catch you all over again.

541
01:01:57,643 --> 01:01:59,702
I'll see you, Walter.

542
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:22,098
Talk to me like you fuckin'...

543
01:02:22,091 --> 01:02:23,991
Speak to me like you fuckin'...

544
01:02:24,715 --> 01:02:26,307
I am not...

545
01:02:27,308 --> 01:02:29,276
I am not...

546
01:03:21,836 --> 01:03:24,566
- Let's go.
- You don't feel sorry for this sick fuck.

547
01:03:24,555 --> 01:03:27,115
- Mind your own business, Pedro.
- This is my business.

548
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:35,695
What the hell is goin' on here?

549
01:03:40,203 --> 01:03:41,670
Who did this?

550
01:03:42,859 --> 01:03:45,828
Any man who can't deal with it,
you meet me in the office.

551
01:03:45,803 --> 01:03:48,397
I'll pay you for the week.
You can clear the fuck out.

552
01:03:48,395 --> 01:03:51,364
We got a lot of orders today.
Get to work.

553
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,137
This is bullshit.

554
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:04,760
Are you okay?

555
01:04:09,932 --> 01:04:11,399
Watch your back, bitch.

556
01:04:50,603 --> 01:04:52,571
This is ready whenever.

557
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:05,627
Where's Walter?

558
01:05:05,643 --> 01:05:07,167
I don't know.

559
01:05:11,051 --> 01:05:12,643
I don't fucking believe this.

560
01:05:12,715 --> 01:05:15,775
- Goddamn it, Mary-Kay!
- Bitch, what the fuck are you doin'?

561
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:19,587
- What is going on?
- This is bullshit, Bob!

562
01:05:19,531 --> 01:05:20,998
It's bullshit.

563
01:05:21,963 --> 01:05:24,090
People have the right to know.

564
01:07:06,475 --> 01:07:08,602
See anything interesting?

565
01:07:09,387 --> 01:07:10,854
Not yet.

566
01:07:23,595 --> 01:07:27,224
- What are you writin' in that book?
- It's my bird book.

567
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:30,637
I've identified 67 species
of birds this year alone.

568
01:07:30,603 --> 01:07:32,571
Wow.

569
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:37,716
Where are your friends?

570
01:07:39,915 --> 01:07:42,008
Don't you have any friends?

571
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,263
I have friends.

572
01:07:48,299 --> 01:07:50,358
A pretty girl like you
should have a lot of friends.

573
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:51,878
I'm not pretty.

574
01:07:51,915 --> 01:07:54,907
- Well, not in the common way.
- What does that mean?

575
01:07:55,883 --> 01:07:58,750
It means that uncommon beauty...

576
01:07:58,731 --> 01:08:00,631
is commonly overlooked.

577
01:08:01,802 --> 01:08:04,737
You know, like people only notice...

578
01:08:04,715 --> 01:08:07,343
the birds with the brightest colors.

579
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:16,891
What's your name?

580
01:08:22,922 --> 01:08:25,982
Let's see. Linda.

581
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:29,144
Susan?

582
01:08:29,163 --> 01:08:30,790
Jennifer?

583
01:08:30,827 --> 01:08:32,795
Jackie?

584
01:08:34,891 --> 01:08:37,758
You tell me your name,
and I'll tell ya mine.

585
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:40,599
Robin.

586
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:42,746
Yeah, like the bird.

587
01:08:43,755 --> 01:08:45,882
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

588
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:48,197
- No, you're not.
- I will be in three months.

589
01:08:48,203 --> 01:08:50,262
I can't wait. I hate being 11.

590
01:08:50,283 --> 01:08:53,081
It has to be the stupidest age
in the world.

591
01:08:58,763 --> 01:09:00,230
What's your name?

592
01:09:01,419 --> 01:09:03,011
Walter.

593
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:06,111
- Do you have many friends?
- No.

594
01:09:06,091 --> 01:09:08,059
How come?

595
01:09:08,075 --> 01:09:11,670
A long time ago, I was sent away f...

596
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:15,159
When I came home,
all my friends were gone.

597
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:17,306
Sounds like you were banished.

598
01:09:19,435 --> 01:09:21,528
Banished, yeah.

599
01:09:21,547 --> 01:09:24,277
Birds are my friends.
They know I watch them...

600
01:09:24,299 --> 01:09:26,767
but they don't mind
because they like being watched...

601
01:09:26,794 --> 01:09:29,262
if they know
you won't hurt them.

602
01:09:36,011 --> 01:09:38,138
- Robin...
- Yes?

603
01:09:39,787 --> 01:09:41,812
Would you like to sit on my lap?

604
01:09:42,635 --> 01:09:44,102
What?

605
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:47,418
Would you like to sit on my lap?

606
01:09:47,435 --> 01:09:49,403
No, thank you.

607
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,914
Okay.

608
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,907
Doesn't matter.

609
01:10:00,811 --> 01:10:02,779
Do you want me to sit on your lap?

610
01:10:07,243 --> 01:10:09,268
Yes.

611
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:11,384
I would enjoy that.

612
01:10:20,491 --> 01:10:23,585
I know this place that's really quiet...

613
01:10:23,563 --> 01:10:26,532
except for the sound
of these tiny little birds.

614
01:10:27,819 --> 01:10:30,287
They sound like finches.

615
01:10:30,283 --> 01:10:32,581
Yeah, they might be finches.

616
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:36,962
Do you want to see?

617
01:10:43,275 --> 01:10:45,505
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.

618
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:49,221
- Does he?
- Yes.

619
01:10:49,227 --> 01:10:51,354
Do you like it when he asks you?

620
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:55,430
No.

621
01:11:05,963 --> 01:11:07,954
Why not?

622
01:11:16,811 --> 01:11:19,006
Are you two alone
when he asks you?

623
01:11:24,203 --> 01:11:27,172
Does he say strange things?

624
01:11:32,267 --> 01:11:34,735
Does he move his legs
in funny ways?

625
01:12:04,394 --> 01:12:05,861
Walter...

626
01:12:08,395 --> 01:12:10,693
do you still want me
to sit on your lap?

627
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:14,159
I will.

628
01:12:14,186 --> 01:12:15,653
I don't mind.

629
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,301
No.

630
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:28,601
Go home, Robin.

631
01:15:41,131 --> 01:15:42,598
Come on in. It's open.

632
01:15:44,267 --> 01:15:46,030
Hey, Walter.

633
01:15:48,234 --> 01:15:50,259
What can I do for you,
Sergeant Lucas?

634
01:15:50,954 --> 01:15:52,854
I don't know. We'll see.

635
01:15:52,874 --> 01:15:57,641
You didn't hear? Last night...

636
01:15:57,547 --> 01:16:00,812
all that shoutin'
and screamin' outside?

637
01:16:02,314 --> 01:16:03,781
No.

638
01:16:03,819 --> 01:16:07,118
Yeah, a guy got beat up
pretty bad last night out there.

639
01:16:07,082 --> 01:16:08,982
- You don't know anything about this?
- Nope.

640
01:16:09,002 --> 01:16:10,492
I could take ya downtown.

641
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:13,733
Yeah, you could...

642
01:16:14,954 --> 01:16:17,047
but it'd be a waste of your time.

643
01:16:17,066 --> 01:16:22,026
There was a boy there.
He could I.D. The assailant.

644
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:24,091
He gave a description.

645
01:16:24,138 --> 01:16:26,606
It fits you really, really close.

646
01:16:31,338 --> 01:16:32,862
That's a nasty scratch
on your neck.

647
01:16:35,178 --> 01:16:36,907
I got a passionate girlfriend.

648
01:16:42,155 --> 01:16:44,123
What's with the boxes?

649
01:16:44,139 --> 01:16:45,766
I'm movin' in with her.

650
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:51,598
Congrats. Lucky you.

651
01:16:52,427 --> 01:16:54,418
I count my blessings.

652
01:16:54,474 --> 01:16:56,567
Yeah, I bet you do.

653
01:17:00,266 --> 01:17:02,359
Well, all right.

654
01:17:03,531 --> 01:17:06,261
I'll be seein' you around, Walter.

655
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:12,128
Hey.

656
01:17:14,218 --> 01:17:16,448
You think you're gonna
catch this guy?

657
01:17:16,458 --> 01:17:18,926
Yeah. Yeah.

658
01:17:18,922 --> 01:17:20,651
We're gonna catch him.

659
01:17:22,058 --> 01:17:24,652
But the victim can't talk.

660
01:17:25,322 --> 01:17:28,553
Among all his other injuries,
he's got a broken jaw.

661
01:17:28,522 --> 01:17:30,820
However, we did run
a check on the victim...

662
01:17:30,827 --> 01:17:33,125
and as it turns out
he's wanted in Virginia.

663
01:17:34,122 --> 01:17:36,215
Raped a boy down there.

664
01:17:48,234 --> 01:17:51,203
You stay out of trouble, Walter.
I'm watchin' you.

665
01:19:15,915 --> 01:19:17,883
<i>I saw my sister.</i>

666
01:19:18,858 --> 01:19:20,826
<i>It was hard.</i>

667
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:25,290
<i>She's still really hurt and angry.</i>

668
01:19:28,043 --> 01:19:30,671
<i>I understand that. I do.</i>

669
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:42,702
<i>It's gonna take time, Walter.</i>

670
01:19:44,234 --> 01:19:45,701
<i>Time?</i>

671
01:19:48,394 --> 01:19:50,692
<i>How do you feel about that?</i>

672
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:54,213
<i>I feel...</i>

673
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:57,797
<i>okay.</i>
