1
00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:56.545
It's pretty windy out.

2
00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:08.610
That'd better not be
the one where you blow people up.

3
00:02:08.626 --> 00:02:10.585
It's not, mom.

4
00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:17.601
Dad, look what I can do.

5
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:19.631
I've been practicing.

6
00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:25.616
That's spectacular, kiddo.

7
00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:27.555
Cool.

8
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:31.566
You're inside out.

9
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:34.601
Oh I knew that.

10
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:36.621
It doesn't work for you?

11
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:40.581
I can't believe
you taught him that.

12
00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:43.581
I didn't.
He did it on his own.

13
00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:47.573
Charlie, did you
brush your teeth?

14
00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.564
- Yes.
- Charlie

15
00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.589
I brushed them.

16
00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.589
Let me see.

17
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.589
Look at this, Con.

18
00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.573
Let's go. I'm serious.

19
00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:57.572
You're driving me bonkers, mom.

20
00:02:58.591 --> 00:02:59.591
Let's go.

21
00:02:59.602 --> 00:03:01.588
Con, remember when
we were going to buy Omnidel

22
00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:03.539
and you said no?

23
00:03:03.563 --> 00:03:04.606
Do you remember
what the price was?

24
00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:07.553
$1.50.

25
00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:09.576
Close: $1.61.

26
00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:10.579
I'll do it, mom.

27
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.539
No, I'm going to do it.

28
00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.553
Do you know what
it's going for now, Con?

29
00:03:14.564 --> 00:03:16.540
- Say, "e".
- Eeeee.

30
00:03:16.591 --> 00:03:17.620
Guess, Con.

31
00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.549
Edward,
I don't know. All right?

32
00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:22.573
All right. Now rinse.

33
00:03:22.584 --> 00:03:23.603
$74.

34
00:03:23.614 --> 00:03:26.530
Really rinse. And pee.

35
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:28.590
I should have
bought it. Shit.

36
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.554
So buy some.

37
00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:33.575
Too late, Con. Too late.

38
00:03:33.608 --> 00:03:35.584
Lift the seat, honey.

39
00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:41.620
Don't forget to put it down

40
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:45.607
when you finish.

41
00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:51.537
Do you really
need all that stuff?

42
00:03:51.548 --> 00:03:54.611
Mom, no one
wears these dorky hats.

43
00:03:55.545 --> 00:03:57.535
Well you do
and you're not a dork.

44
00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:58.588
How do I look?

45
00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.545
Very handsome.

46
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:04.608
Love you.
OK. Come on. Let's go!

47
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.525
Jesus!

48
00:04:08.565 --> 00:04:09.572
Come on.

49
00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:12.591
Maybe you shouldn't
go in today.

50
00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:14.555
I promised I'd do
that stuff for the auction

51
00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:16.572
and someone's
got a birthday coming up.

52
00:04:16.582 --> 00:04:18.620
Latrell Sprewell Jersey, mom:

53
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.572
Don't forget.

54
00:04:20.613 --> 00:04:22.543
He's on the Yankees, right?

55
00:04:22.553 --> 00:04:23.579
Mom.

56
00:04:23.609 --> 00:04:26.552
You're driving me bonkers.

57
00:04:26.562 --> 00:04:28.579
You're driving him bonkers.

58
00:04:33.546 --> 00:04:34.566
Jesus.

59
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.572
It's a holiday there.

60
00:04:36.582 --> 00:04:37.596
Well
I'll just keep talking.

61
00:04:37.607 --> 00:04:40.536
No, no. That's OK.
But in order to pick up

62
00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:09.582
Taxi

63
00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:11.521
Shit

64
00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:14.532
Taxi

65
00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:17.612
Taxi, taxi

66
00:06:53.528 --> 00:06:55.525
Oh shit

67
00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:57.610
I'm so sorry.

68
00:06:57.611 --> 00:07:00.561
- <i>Oh putanne. Mes bouquins!</i>
- I'm so sorry.

69
00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:02.558
<i>Putanne. Mes bouquins!</i>

70
00:07:03.594 --> 00:07:04.611
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:05.602 --> 00:07:07.554
I'll get your things.

72
00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:14.562
Oh shit

73
00:07:18.512 --> 00:07:20.561
Taxi, taxi

74
00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:22.549
My books. <i>Putanne.</i>

75
00:07:35.597 --> 00:07:38.562
I need a taxi.
Could you help me get a taxi.

76
00:07:38.567 --> 00:07:39.567
OK.

77
00:07:40.567 --> 00:07:41.586
I'll watch your books.

78
00:07:41.588 --> 00:07:43.555
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

79
00:07:46.543 --> 00:07:48.569
Hey.

80
00:07:51.567 --> 00:07:52.586
Hey.

81
00:08:05.574 --> 00:08:07.520
A bad day for taxis.

82
00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:09.530
It's this horrible wind.

83
00:08:09.534 --> 00:08:11.590
Yeah. You
shot down there like a bullet.

84
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:14.580
If you'd flapped your arms
you'd be home by now.

85
00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:17.507
I'll remember that next time.

86
00:08:19.514 --> 00:08:20.567
That's not good.

87
00:08:21.517 --> 00:08:21.580
I know.

88
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:25.584
Listen. That's
me up there: the flower pot.

89
00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:29.605
I'll get you a band-aid. OK?

90
00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:36.524
Hold on to something.
Don't blow away.

91
00:08:38.575 --> 00:08:42.564
Or... you can
come on up and clean it off, no?

92
00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:44.601
Come on.

93
00:08:45.595 --> 00:08:48.564
I'm not
an ax murderer. I promise.

94
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:02.556
Oh shit

95
00:09:03.564 --> 00:09:05.533
Fucking elevator!

96
00:09:05.584 --> 00:09:07.544
<i>Ne marche pas jamais cet ascenseur.</i>

97
00:09:07.584 --> 00:09:09.532
<i>Ascenseur de merde!</i>

98
00:09:11.599 --> 00:09:13.545
<i>Allez.</i>  One more.

99
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:36.519
Pardon the mess.

100
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.508
Are you a writer?

101
00:09:40.556 --> 00:09:42.532
I'm a book dealer.

102
00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:48.542
The bathroom's
right down there, on the left.

103
00:09:51.534 --> 00:09:52.586
Go ahead.

104
00:09:52.587 --> 00:09:54.577
There's a medicine cabinet.

105
00:09:55.547 --> 00:09:58.542
You can sneak
a peak at my prescriptions.

106
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:07.547
Hello.

107
00:11:18.502 --> 00:11:20.498
I made you some tea.

108
00:11:20.499 --> 00:11:21.536
Thank you.

109
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.540
Do you box?

110
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.570
I used to, when I was young.

111
00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:31.579
This is an amazing place.

112
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.511
Yeah but it's not mine.

113
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:36.527
No?

114
00:11:36.531 --> 00:11:38.503
The owner
is a friend, a sculptor

115
00:11:38.505 --> 00:11:41.507
and he's living
in Paris so... that's cool.

116
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:43.551
We can stay here,
me and my books.

117
00:11:48.525 --> 00:11:51.518
I... can I use your phone?

118
00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:52.532
I have to call home.

119
00:11:52.535 --> 00:11:55.505
Oh sure.
There's a phone just behind you.

120
00:11:55.508 --> 00:11:56.558
Thank you.

121
00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:04.568
Gloria? Hi. It's me.

122
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:06.525
Good.

123
00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:08.515
How's Charlie?

124
00:12:08.576 --> 00:12:11.566
Hi, honey.
How was your day at school?

125
00:12:11.576 --> 00:12:13.589
Yeah? What was the best part?

126
00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:18.556
Guess what. Can you believe
that mommy missed her train?

127
00:12:26.493 --> 00:12:27.510
Ice.

128
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.583
About an hour.

129
00:12:32.493 --> 00:12:34.510
You should start your homework.

130
00:12:34.569 --> 00:12:37.576
No. I promise to
tell you all about it when I see you.

131
00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:39.560
I love you. 'Bye.

132
00:12:41.492 --> 00:12:43.492
That was my son Charlie.

133
00:12:43.534 --> 00:12:46.535
He's 8. He'll be 9 next week.

134
00:12:46.536 --> 00:12:49.577
I'm Paul Martel.
I'll be 28 in July.

135
00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:52.568
I'm Constance

136
00:12:53.507 --> 00:12:55.530
and I'm late. I have to go.

137
00:12:56.507 --> 00:12:59.514
Before you go,
take your book... no?

138
00:13:00.495 --> 00:13:04.559
Oh no. I couldn't. I don't.

139
00:13:04.572 --> 00:13:06.530
Sure you can:

140
00:13:06.532 --> 00:13:08.518
a souvenir.

141
00:13:08.558 --> 00:13:10.487
Go down there

142
00:13:10.499 --> 00:13:12.491
you know, like before.

143
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:13.566
OK.

144
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.539
Keep going.

145
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.548
Stop.

146
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.537
Now right.

147
00:13:27.587 --> 00:13:29.544
No. Right.

148
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:35.526
OK, now...
the second shelf from the top.

149
00:13:35.558 --> 00:13:38.505
Take the fourth one from the left.

150
00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:39.574
Got it?

151
00:13:40.564 --> 00:13:42.516
I think so.

152
00:13:42.518 --> 00:13:44.551
Open to page 23.

153
00:13:52.556 --> 00:13:54.559
<i>Drink wine.</i>

154
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.582
<i>This is life eternal.</i>

155
00:13:57.492 --> 00:13:58.573
<i>This, all that youth</i>

156
00:13:58.573 --> 00:14:00.552
<i>will give to you.</i>

157
00:14:00.563 --> 00:14:02.570
<i>It is the season for wine</i>

158
00:14:02.572 --> 00:14:05.520
<i>roses, and drunken friends.</i>

159
00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:07.581
<i>Be happy for this moment.</i>

160
00:14:07.582 --> 00:14:09.492
<i>This moment</i>

161
00:14:09.504 --> 00:14:11.563
<i>is your life.</i>

162
00:14:20.494 --> 00:14:21.549
I have to go.

163
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:23.496
Thank you.

164
00:14:24.487 --> 00:14:25.548
Can you find your way out?

165
00:14:25.551 --> 00:14:26.575
I hope so.

166
00:14:29.558 --> 00:14:31.528
That's my bedroom.

167
00:14:34.524 --> 00:14:37.545
It was nice
meeting you, Constance.

168
00:14:38.575 --> 00:14:42.494
Hey. Come back if you need
more books or... medical attention.

169
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:16.488
A perfect 10 there!

170
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:18.576
Oh my! Did you see that?

171
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.535
Hey, Glo, hey.

172
00:15:24.539 --> 00:15:26.516
That wouldn't be
the TV on, would it?

173
00:15:26.557 --> 00:15:28.549
I was just turning it off.

174
00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:30.516
Sure you were.

175
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.532
The wind
knocked me down today, Glo.

176
00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:42.546
Oh yeah? Are you all right?
Do you need anything?

177
00:15:44.497 --> 00:15:45.533
Gross!

178
00:15:45.574 --> 00:15:49.519
- Were you in a fight?
- No. I just fell over.

179
00:15:49.528 --> 00:15:50.540
Does it hurt?

180
00:15:50.561 --> 00:15:51.553
A little bit.

181
00:15:51.555 --> 00:15:53.503
Cool!

182
00:15:53.534 --> 00:15:54.533
Where are you going?

183
00:15:54.545 --> 00:15:56.508
To get the camera.

184
00:15:56.528 --> 00:15:58.536
- Try this.
- Thank you.

185
00:16:00.478 --> 00:16:02.477
What do you need a camera for?

186
00:16:02.478 --> 00:16:04.564
It's for school.
We're doing blood and stuff.

187
00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:08.511
OK. Now
look like it really hurts.

188
00:16:08.522 --> 00:16:09.575
- Ready?
- Yep.

189
00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:14.557
This'll be great.

190
00:16:15.488 --> 00:16:16.547
The wind blew her down.

191
00:16:16.549 --> 00:16:19.474
She bled and everything.

192
00:16:19.475 --> 00:16:20.575
Everybody's hats blew off.

193
00:16:21.475 --> 00:16:22.549
Look who's
the world photographer!

194
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.502
Are you OK?

195
00:16:23.506 --> 00:16:25.568
Yeah.
It took me down like an old lady.

196
00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:28.478
- Honey
- It's humiliating.

197
00:16:28.482 --> 00:16:30.528
Dad, look at the pictures.

198
00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:34.534
At least we've got
the evidence. Anyone we can sue?

199
00:16:34.538 --> 00:16:35.552
No.

200
00:16:36.502 --> 00:16:38.549
There was
this nice guy who helped me.

201
00:16:38.549 --> 00:16:41.514
It was like this, dad.
It was a twister.

202
00:16:44.495 --> 00:16:45.552
Dad, look.

203
00:16:46.513 --> 00:16:49.524
It was like this.
This is a tornado.

204
00:16:50.475 --> 00:16:54.524
He lived around there. He got me
some bandaids and put me in a taxi.

205
00:16:56.473 --> 00:16:57.522
Is he good looking?

206
00:17:01.473 --> 00:17:02.516
I feel sick.

207
00:17:02.566 --> 00:17:04.528
Did you do
your homework, Charlie?

208
00:17:04.529 --> 00:17:07.492
I can't.
I don't know how to do it.

209
00:17:07.534 --> 00:17:09.502
Well come on. I'll help you.

210
00:17:09.504 --> 00:17:11.478
You can help me with mine.

211
00:17:12.489 --> 00:17:14.553
Did you get his name, this guy?

212
00:17:15.505 --> 00:17:17.519
You can send him a bottle a wine

213
00:17:18.541 --> 00:17:20.504
cheap wine.

214
00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:38.554
Con, stand there a second.
Con, wait a minute.

215
00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:42.537
Just stay there a second. I'm just
trying to figure out how to do the

216
00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:46.551
The thing
I can't figure out is the

217
00:17:46.562 --> 00:17:48.514
zoom thing here.

218
00:17:48.554 --> 00:17:51.548
There it is.
OK. Hold on. Stay there.

219
00:17:51.551 --> 00:17:54.541
The zooming thingie... zooming in.

220
00:17:57.563 --> 00:18:00.467
Stay there. No, come on.
I'm just trying to figure this thing out.

221
00:18:00.467 --> 00:18:01.554
I want to see if it focuses.

222
00:18:02.544 --> 00:18:04.544
Hold on. Come here.

223
00:18:07.477 --> 00:18:09.472
Cool. Very cool.

224
00:18:09.513 --> 00:18:11.475
So beautiful!

225
00:18:11.486 --> 00:18:14.468
If you only knew... Look at you.

226
00:18:14.478 --> 00:18:16.484
God! What a beauty!

227
00:18:25.547 --> 00:18:27.494
Is something the matter?

228
00:18:30.512 --> 00:18:31.531
Nothing.

229
00:18:32.502 --> 00:18:33.542
Nothing at all.

230
00:18:33.547 --> 00:18:35.499
Good.

231
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.500
Come here.

232
00:18:51.503 --> 00:18:53.557
- This is really good.
- No, it isn't. Go away.

233
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.550
- Come here.
- This is major.

234
00:19:00.521 --> 00:19:02.501
I think it really is zooming in.

235
00:19:02.511 --> 00:19:03.540
I've found the zoom.

236
00:19:03.551 --> 00:19:05.482
I've found it.

237
00:19:06.463 --> 00:19:07.520
Dad.

238
00:19:08.532 --> 00:19:09.496
Mom.

239
00:19:09.497 --> 00:19:11.463
Shit. OK.

240
00:19:11.469 --> 00:19:13.538
I can't sleep.

241
00:19:13.548 --> 00:19:16.520
- That camera
- Jesus!

242
00:19:18.483 --> 00:19:21.504
I'll be back...
Don't fall asleep.

243
00:19:22.515 --> 00:19:24.463
It works.

244
00:19:29.488 --> 00:19:31.511
Mom, are you nuts?

245
00:19:31.516 --> 00:19:33.536
You forgot my lunch.

246
00:19:33.538 --> 00:19:34.555
I did not.

247
00:19:34.555 --> 00:19:37.517
It's by the door. Come with me.

248
00:19:37.538 --> 00:19:39.557
What are you chewing?

249
00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:40.546
Nothing.

250
00:19:41.479 --> 00:19:42.530
Spit that out. What is that?

251
00:19:46.511 --> 00:19:47.553
That's lovely.

252
00:19:48.472 --> 00:19:49.489
- Mom?
- Yes?

253
00:19:49.493 --> 00:19:51.529
I don't want to be
a dumb bunny.

254
00:19:51.533 --> 00:19:53.513
Honey, it's a play.

255
00:19:53.523 --> 00:19:55.488
There are lots of other bunnies.

256
00:19:55.498 --> 00:19:57.485
It would be cool to be a bunny.

257
00:19:57.486 --> 00:20:00.476
- You're bonkers, mom.
- That's what you tell me.

258
00:20:00.493 --> 00:20:02.463
- Love you.
- Love you too. What's that?

259
00:20:02.464 --> 00:20:04.555
Oh. Thank you.

260
00:20:09.485 --> 00:20:10.504
'Bye.

261
00:21:23.519 --> 00:21:24.539
Shit.

262
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.454
Hi. This is Paul Martel.

263
00:22:17.465 --> 00:22:20.467
Leave a message
after the beep. Thanks.

264
00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:24.478
Hello?

265
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:25.477
Hello?

266
00:22:25.478 --> 00:22:26.512
- Hello
- Hello!

267
00:22:26.515 --> 00:22:28.485
You're... there.

268
00:22:29.486 --> 00:22:30.532
This is Connie Sumner.

269
00:22:30.533 --> 00:22:33.470
The one from
the really windy day.

270
00:22:33.471 --> 00:22:34.536
Oh that one!

271
00:22:36.506 --> 00:22:38.506
How's the knee? Did you ice it?

272
00:22:38.542 --> 00:22:41.517
Yes, I iced it
and I elevated it and

273
00:22:42.467 --> 00:22:45.498
you name it: I did it
and it's much better and I

274
00:22:45.502 --> 00:22:48.485
and I just wanted to call
and I wanted to thank you and

275
00:22:48.508 --> 00:22:50.472
I wanted to
ask for your address.

276
00:22:50.473 --> 00:22:51.510
because I wanted to
send you a bottle of

277
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.512
- Where are you?
- What?

278
00:22:53.513 --> 00:22:56.479
I said, where are you?

279
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.455
I'm in Grand Central.

280
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.509
It's really hard to hear you.

281
00:23:02.512 --> 00:23:04.456
Come and see me.

282
00:23:04.459 --> 00:23:05.473
What?

283
00:23:05.474 --> 00:23:07.453
Yeah, take a break.

284
00:23:07.513 --> 00:23:09.486
I'll make you some coffee.

285
00:23:12.454 --> 00:23:13.495
Coffee.

286
00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:21.456
OK.

287
00:23:21.456 --> 00:23:22.516
OK.

288
00:23:23.467 --> 00:23:24.513
See you. 'Bye.

289
00:23:24.533 --> 00:23:26.464
Fuck

290
00:23:37.481 --> 00:23:40.466
No permanent damage, I see.

291
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.471
We take Medicaid, Blue Cross.

292
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.530
I'm uninsured.

293
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:52.469
No, I'm afraid
we don't take charity cases here.

294
00:23:57.526 --> 00:23:59.461
It was a joke.

295
00:24:08.452 --> 00:24:09.508
Oh look at this.

296
00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:11.476
Jack London.

297
00:24:11.496 --> 00:24:13.480
First edition of "White Fang".

298
00:24:13.481 --> 00:24:16.457
In the original dust jacket
and do you know what?

299
00:24:16.458 --> 00:24:18.460
I got it for a buck and 50.

300
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.468
What's it worth?

301
00:24:20.537 --> 00:24:23.458
About 4,000 times more.

302
00:24:26.513 --> 00:24:28.470
Those are in French.

303
00:24:29.462 --> 00:24:30.535
I took it in school.

304
00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:35.451
<i>Tu veux enlever ton manteau?</i>

305
00:24:36.494 --> 00:24:38.539
Do I want to
take off something?

306
00:24:39.499 --> 00:24:42.494
Your coat.

307
00:24:43.443 --> 00:24:45.487
Would you
like to take off your coat?

308
00:24:45.489 --> 00:24:47.507
Yes, my coat.

309
00:24:48.497 --> 00:24:49.524
Thank you.

310
00:24:58.472 --> 00:25:01.516
But I can't stay very long.
I have some errands I have to run.

311
00:25:03.489 --> 00:25:05.522
- I'll get the coffe.
- OK.

312
00:25:12.526 --> 00:25:14.475
Shit

313
00:25:27.533 --> 00:25:29.476
It's in Braille.

314
00:25:30.478 --> 00:25:31.474
Braille.

315
00:25:31.514 --> 00:25:34.481
No. Braille. He was French.

316
00:25:36.452 --> 00:25:37.502
Close your eyes.

317
00:25:37.535 --> 00:25:39.458
What?

318
00:25:39.509 --> 00:25:41.463
Close your eyes.

319
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.445
<i>My mother makes me chicken.</i>

320
00:26:01.531 --> 00:26:05.501
<i>Her chicken makes me cough.</i>

321
00:26:06.522 --> 00:26:10.439
<i>I wish that when she made it</i>

322
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.486
<i>she took the feathers off.</i>

323
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.480
It doesn't say that.

324
00:26:30.508 --> 00:26:32.487
I had better go.

325
00:26:32.488 --> 00:26:35.477
I've got to go.

326
00:26:40.454 --> 00:26:42.481
Take care. Don't fall.

327
00:26:42.502 --> 00:26:44.494
Thanks for the coffee.

328
00:26:45.505 --> 00:26:47.462
You didn't drink it.

329
00:27:00.498 --> 00:27:02.438
Hi.

330
00:27:04.458 --> 00:27:05.458
Lindsay, hi.

331
00:27:05.498 --> 00:27:07.448
Connie.

332
00:27:07.468 --> 00:27:09.488
- Let me buzz him.
- Thanks.

333
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:14.517
Hey. What a surprise.

334
00:27:15.478 --> 00:27:16.455
Look at you!

335
00:27:16.456 --> 00:27:18.435
- Hi, Bill.
- Hi, Connie.

336
00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:19.436
Am I interrupting?

337
00:27:19.446 --> 00:27:20.507
- No.
- I was just leaving.

338
00:27:20.509 --> 00:27:23.473
All right, I'll get you
the budget for those trucks later.

339
00:27:23.476 --> 00:27:24.495
All right. Thanks.

340
00:27:24.496 --> 00:27:25.525
Would you like a coffee?

341
00:27:26.437 --> 00:27:28.459
No, thank you.

342
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:37.492
That's nice.

343
00:27:38.456 --> 00:27:39.505
You know, I didn't
know you were coming in today.

344
00:27:39.505 --> 00:27:41.462
I could have given you a ride.

345
00:27:41.473 --> 00:27:43.505
You're freezing. What is that?

346
00:27:43.515 --> 00:27:47.469
Well I was around the corner
and I brought you a present.

347
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.436
What's the occasion?

348
00:27:50.497 --> 00:27:52.513
Nothing. I don't know.

349
00:27:53.503 --> 00:27:56.511
It's a medium
but they said it runs large.

350
00:27:57.484 --> 00:27:59.439
Look at that.

351
00:27:59.461 --> 00:28:01.429
You don't have to try it on.

352
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:03.512
I'm the boss.
I can do whatever I want.

353
00:28:12.458 --> 00:28:13.491
What do you think?

354
00:28:15.491 --> 00:28:17.455
Hold on just a second.

355
00:28:19.452 --> 00:28:20.473
Yeah?

356
00:28:21.464 --> 00:28:24.520
Oh all right
but hold the other calls.

357
00:28:25.508 --> 00:28:27.468
You're busy. I'll go.

358
00:28:27.508 --> 00:28:30.440
- I'll go.
- No. Sit.

359
00:28:30.443 --> 00:28:31.477
Hello, Henry.

360
00:28:31.478 --> 00:28:34.448
Yeah, so what is
this suspension problem?

361
00:28:34.458 --> 00:28:36.488
No, I never received it.

362
00:28:38.448 --> 00:28:40.498
Well all right.
Well get it to me.

363
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.515
Henry, this...
No, it's not good enough.

364
00:28:43.516 --> 00:28:46.458
I'm sitting here
with 200 trucks that I can't use.

365
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:48.428
All right.
Well set up a meeting.

366
00:28:48.429 --> 00:28:50.486
Yeah and I want
Frank Burnbaum there.

367
00:28:51.424 --> 00:28:52.489
'Cause I don't feel
good about this guy.

368
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.460
When I tell someone
to do something, I want it done.

369
00:28:55.507 --> 00:28:57.489
I'm sure you will.

370
00:29:00.426 --> 00:29:01.523
Anyway...

371
00:29:02.523 --> 00:29:05.472
So what else are you up to?

372
00:29:06.484 --> 00:29:08.472
- Auction.
- Yeah?

373
00:29:08.474 --> 00:29:09.507
Who'd you hit on?

374
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.437
The usual suspects.

375
00:29:16.519 --> 00:29:18.469
Who?

376
00:29:20.477 --> 00:29:23.496
- Bob Gaylord.
- Bob?

377
00:29:25.436 --> 00:29:28.478
You get a pledge out of Bob
and they should send you to the middle east!

378
00:29:35.454 --> 00:29:36.513
So tell me.

379
00:29:38.504 --> 00:29:40.434
What?

380
00:29:42.424 --> 00:29:43.506
What do you think?

381
00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:45.490
It's a keeper.

382
00:29:46.487 --> 00:29:47.516
Jeez!

383
00:30:50.436 --> 00:30:51.427
Hello.

384
00:30:51.436 --> 00:30:52.485
Hello.

385
00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.513
Here I am again.

386
00:31:00.443 --> 00:31:02.433
I brought muffins.

387
00:31:03.453 --> 00:31:05.422
<i>Tu veux enlever ton manteau?</i>

388
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:18.513
What is this music?

389
00:31:19.414 --> 00:31:20.481
Do you like it?

390
00:31:21.422 --> 00:31:22.431
Yes.

391
00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:25.507
Do you want to dance?

392
00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.465
Now?

393
00:31:28.475 --> 00:31:30.427
Yeah.

394
00:31:31.469 --> 00:31:32.511
OK.

395
00:31:36.441 --> 00:31:38.478
I have to warn you:
I tend to lead.

396
00:31:38.478 --> 00:31:41.420
Of course: You are American.

397
00:31:52.441 --> 00:31:54.458
You've done this before.

398
00:31:54.469 --> 00:31:56.435
What?

399
00:31:58.488 --> 00:32:01.492
How many
girlfriends have you had?

400
00:32:04.419 --> 00:32:07.428
Two.

401
00:32:07.488 --> 00:32:09.493
Really?

402
00:32:10.444 --> 00:32:12.483
Would I lie to you?

403
00:32:13.413 --> 00:32:14.494
I don't know. Would you?

404
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.413
Your eyes are amazing.
Do you know that?

405
00:32:36.414 --> 00:32:38.490
You should never shut them,
not even at night.

406
00:32:39.451 --> 00:32:42.426
You should learn to
sleep with your eyes open.

407
00:32:45.414 --> 00:32:47.410
I'll work on that.

408
00:32:47.491 --> 00:32:49.450
Will you?

409
00:32:53.421 --> 00:32:54.446
Hang on.

410
00:32:59.415 --> 00:33:01.417
I think this is a mistake.

411
00:33:04.407 --> 00:33:05.494
There's
no such thing as a mistake.

412
00:33:05.499 --> 00:33:08.477
There's what you do
and what you don't do.

413
00:33:10.407 --> 00:33:12.413
I can't do this.

414
00:33:25.423 --> 00:33:26.502
I forgot my coat.

415
00:35:42.464 --> 00:35:44.444
I can't.

416
00:35:44.454 --> 00:35:46.454
What? What's wrong?

417
00:35:46.465 --> 00:35:48.457
I can't.
I don't know how to do this.

418
00:35:48.468 --> 00:35:50.480
- This is wrong.
- Hit me.

419
00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:52.417
I don't want to.

420
00:35:52.427 --> 00:35:53.480
Hit me.

421
00:35:59.462 --> 00:36:01.440
Hit me.

422
00:37:36.402 --> 00:37:37.421
Say, Ed!

423
00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:39.454
- Hey, Bob!
- I haven't seen you in a while.

424
00:37:39.463 --> 00:37:42.418
No. I've been
working late this week.

425
00:37:42.478 --> 00:37:44.431
How's the boy?

426
00:37:44.482 --> 00:37:46.457
He's a pistol of a kid.
He's going to have a birthday.

427
00:37:46.458 --> 00:37:47.462
- Really? How old?
- 9.

428
00:37:48.402 --> 00:37:51.395
So any major armed robberies?

429
00:37:51.406 --> 00:37:53.409
No, not this week.

430
00:37:53.469 --> 00:37:54.482
Speaking of armed robberies

431
00:37:55.393 --> 00:37:56.432
you'd better
watch out for Connie.

432
00:37:56.432 --> 00:37:58.441
She's going to get you
to sign over your mortgage.

433
00:37:58.452 --> 00:38:00.415
What do you mean?

434
00:38:00.426 --> 00:38:03.401
Did she try to
hit on you for some money?

435
00:38:03.403 --> 00:38:04.202
No.

436
00:38:04.397 --> 00:38:06.415
I thought
she'd talked to you about this

437
00:38:06.416 --> 00:38:08.465
school auction... or whatever.

438
00:38:08.476 --> 00:38:10.396
Not me

439
00:38:10.416 --> 00:38:12.456
but I've been out of town.
Maybe she talked to Maggie about it.

440
00:38:14.469 --> 00:38:17.402
Yeah, I guess I got it wrong.

441
00:38:17.414 --> 00:38:19.439
Anyway we owe you a dinner.

442
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:22.448
Yeah.

443
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:33.441
He's out.

444
00:38:36.448 --> 00:38:38.404
Can I get you anything?

445
00:38:38.435 --> 00:38:41.410
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

446
00:38:44.468 --> 00:38:46.424
A tough day?

447
00:38:47.385 --> 00:38:48.457
Not really.

448
00:38:50.386 --> 00:38:52.423
How about you?
How was your day?

449
00:38:53.437 --> 00:38:55.411
It was good.

450
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:57.466
You know, the usual stuff.

451
00:39:04.472 --> 00:39:06.452
Sure you don't want anything?

452
00:39:07.432 --> 00:39:08.468
No.

453
00:39:10.402 --> 00:39:11.412
Con?

454
00:39:11.442 --> 00:39:12.468
Yeah?

455
00:39:13.479 --> 00:39:15.465
Do you love me?

456
00:39:16.436 --> 00:39:18.476
Of course I love you.

457
00:39:20.396 --> 00:39:22.425
What a silly question.

458
00:39:23.456 --> 00:39:28.385
I guess...
I'm just feeling silly.

459
00:39:33.395 --> 00:39:35.395
I'll be up in a minute.

460
00:39:35.437 --> 00:39:36.446
OK.

461
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.409
Sorry.

462
00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:45.453
What are we doing here?

463
00:41:47.441 --> 00:41:49.397
Having lunch.

464
00:41:51.435 --> 00:41:53.437
I shouldn't be doing this.

465
00:41:53.437 --> 00:41:56.374
What? You
shouldn't be having lunch?

466
00:41:56.384 --> 00:41:57.464
Not with you.

467
00:41:58.434 --> 00:42:00.418
I think we should leave.

468
00:42:06.405 --> 00:42:07.441
Listen.

469
00:42:08.382 --> 00:42:11.382
See those guys
over there paying the check?

470
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.382
- Yes.
- OK.

471
00:42:15.384 --> 00:42:18.418
If the guy on the right pays
we'll leave right now.

472
00:42:18.419 --> 00:42:22.395
If the guy
on the left pays, we'll stay

473
00:42:24.466 --> 00:42:27.377
and... I'll kiss you.

474
00:42:27.448 --> 00:42:29.437
No.

475
00:42:29.448 --> 00:42:32.408
No.

476
00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:38.395
Hey. You're kidding me, man.

477
00:42:41.386 --> 00:42:42.442
I win.

478
00:42:46.407 --> 00:42:47.426
No.

479
00:42:47.427 --> 00:42:49.379
- <i>C'est la vie!</i>
- No.

480
00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.424
Don't do it. Don't.

481
00:44:07.364 --> 00:44:08.364
A room for two?

482
00:44:08.368 --> 00:44:09.417
Of course.

483
00:44:46.451 --> 00:44:48.403
Nice music.

484
00:44:48.405 --> 00:44:50.361
What is it?

485
00:44:51.385 --> 00:44:53.418
It's

486
00:44:53.428 --> 00:44:56.397
African, I think.

487
00:44:57.388 --> 00:44:58.437
I like it.

488
00:45:25.446 --> 00:45:27.404
Here.

489
00:45:59.397 --> 00:46:02.444
Let's go to bed. Come on.

490
00:46:02.447 --> 00:46:04.441
Stay here with me.

491
00:46:04.451 --> 00:46:05.431
I'm cold.

492
00:46:05.432 --> 00:46:07.397
- Stay here.
- I'm cold.

493
00:46:12.361 --> 00:46:13.383
Stay here with me.

494
00:46:13.384 --> 00:46:14.384
I'm cold.

495
00:46:14.394 --> 00:46:16.397
Come on. Let's go.

496
00:46:44.379 --> 00:46:45.442
How about lunch today?

497
00:46:46.392 --> 00:46:47.431
Are you free?

498
00:46:48.401 --> 00:46:52.431
I have all this
fund-raiser stuff auction things to pick up.

499
00:46:52.434 --> 00:46:54.403
We can do
an early one, if you want.

500
00:46:54.414 --> 00:46:56.374
How about 12:00?

501
00:46:56.385 --> 00:46:58.354
12:00?

502
00:46:58.365 --> 00:46:59.392
Yeah.

503
00:47:03.363 --> 00:47:05.405
Will I be hungry at 12:00?

504
00:47:13.395 --> 00:47:15.375
We could go in together.

505
00:47:15.386 --> 00:47:17.375
I'll wait for you.

506
00:47:18.427 --> 00:47:21.379
I'm not going to be
ready to go for at least an hour.

507
00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.376
That's all right. I'll wait.

508
00:47:37.362 --> 00:47:39.373
- Oh shit
- What?

509
00:47:39.373 --> 00:47:41.357
I just remembered.

510
00:47:42.387 --> 00:47:45.442
I have a facial
at 12:30 at Georgiana's today.

511
00:47:47.378 --> 00:47:48.424
Oh well

512
00:47:50.364 --> 00:47:52.434
you've got to
stay beautiful, right?

513
00:47:56.442 --> 00:47:59.378
Georgiana's?

514
00:48:01.366 --> 00:48:03.447
A waste of money.

515
00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.366
Yeah, Manhattan.

516
00:48:23.376 --> 00:48:26.427
A beauty salon called Georgina.

517
00:48:28.441 --> 00:48:32.380
Yeah, right.
Yes, Georgiana's. That's right.

518
00:48:34.422 --> 00:48:36.365
Thank you.

519
00:48:42.433 --> 00:48:47.351
Hello. I'm calling
to confirm an appointment today: 12:30.

520
00:48:48.386 --> 00:48:52.386
Sumner,
Connie Sumner. S-U-M-N-E-R.

521
00:48:56.404 --> 00:49:01.376
Could she
be down for another time?

522
00:49:06.345 --> 00:49:07.439
No, thank you.

523
00:49:29.424 --> 00:49:31.437
Connie!

524
00:49:31.438 --> 00:49:34.421
Connie!

525
00:49:34.424 --> 00:49:37.384
- Tracy! Hi.
- Hi.

526
00:49:37.388 --> 00:49:38.434
I was going to call you.

527
00:49:38.435 --> 00:49:41.403
That's what they all say
when I call about bunny costumes.

528
00:49:41.405 --> 00:49:44.341
Do you know
Sally from Planned Parenthood?

529
00:49:44.342 --> 00:49:45.351
Hi. It's been a while.

530
00:49:45.362 --> 00:49:46.421
Well too long.

531
00:49:46.423 --> 00:49:48.363
You look amazing.

532
00:49:48.367 --> 00:49:49.385
So where are you headed?

533
00:49:49.385 --> 00:49:51.388
Oh I was just going to

534
00:49:51.399 --> 00:49:53.404
go and look at
some window shades for the kitchen.

535
00:49:53.415 --> 00:49:55.378
Well we're
going to go and have coffee.

536
00:49:55.388 --> 00:49:57.356
Why don't you join us?

537
00:49:57.357 --> 00:49:59.387
Oh I'm going to be late.

538
00:49:59.388 --> 00:50:01.399
For window shades?

539
00:50:02.381 --> 00:50:03.396
Come on!

540
00:50:03.399 --> 00:50:05.421
OK.

541
00:50:10.401 --> 00:50:12.415
Hi. How are you?

542
00:50:18.416 --> 00:50:21.355
I'm just
going to make a phone call.

543
00:50:21.366 --> 00:50:22.418
Sure.

544
00:50:23.398 --> 00:50:26.396
She could have
used my cell phone.

545
00:50:31.382 --> 00:50:32.418
Hi. It's me.

546
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.364
You're not
going to believe this.

547
00:50:35.414 --> 00:50:37.382
I'm at
the cafe around the corner.

548
00:50:37.394 --> 00:50:40.436
Why do you have to introduce me
as Sally from Planned Parenthood?

549
00:50:41.344 --> 00:50:41.434
What do you mean?

550
00:50:42.344 --> 00:50:45.363
Well it makes it sound like
I'm in New York handing out condoms.

551
00:50:45.367 --> 00:50:47.343
I'm stuck here.

552
00:50:49.407 --> 00:50:51.366
Will you wait for me?

553
00:50:51.427 --> 00:50:53.357
Wait for me.

554
00:50:54.387 --> 00:50:56.407
...with the redhead.
Just can't take it.

555
00:50:56.416 --> 00:50:58.396
She has it
the next morning... all the time.

556
00:50:58.407 --> 00:50:59.434
I had to
call Gloria and remind her

557
00:50:59.434 --> 00:51:02.391
to pick up the dry cleaning
when she gets Charlie.

558
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.421
Never a dull moment.

559
00:51:04.432 --> 00:51:07.378
No. Charlie is so adorable.

560
00:51:08.337 --> 00:51:09.374
Thank you.

561
00:51:25.414 --> 00:51:27.412
I can't eat.

562
00:51:30.365 --> 00:51:31.362
I'll have a coffee.

563
00:51:31.372 --> 00:51:33.431
Well I guess
I'll have coffee too.

564
00:51:35.345 --> 00:51:37.393
Excuse me again.
The ladies room...

565
00:51:41.367 --> 00:51:43.371
God! She looks good.

566
00:51:43.372 --> 00:51:44.427
Do you think she's had work?

567
00:51:45.338 --> 00:51:47.412
Why would she have work?
She still looks gorgeous.

568
00:51:47.419 --> 00:51:48.421
That's
when they're having it now:

569
00:51:49.332 --> 00:51:51.334
early,
before it all goes to shit.

570
00:52:06.361 --> 00:52:08.354
I have friends out there.

571
00:52:15.385 --> 00:52:17.407
You take me to the best places.

572
00:52:18.347 --> 00:52:19.396
Wait.

573
00:52:20.338 --> 00:52:21.414
Let me.

574
00:52:25.418 --> 00:52:28.370
She's not like that.
She's really nice.

575
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:31.334
Of course she is.
That makes it worse.

576
00:52:31.343 --> 00:52:33.373
She is nice and she's sweet.

577
00:52:33.384 --> 00:52:35.369
and her ass
is in exactly the same place it was

578
00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:37.356
when she was in college.

579
00:52:43.399 --> 00:52:45.374
Are you taking tennis?

580
00:52:45.384 --> 00:52:49.372
Oh I wouldn't
call what I do taking tennis.

581
00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:53.336
- OK.
- There you are.

582
00:52:53.339 --> 00:52:54.379
I was beginning to worry.

583
00:52:54.381 --> 00:52:56.381
No, it's fine. I'm fine.

584
00:52:56.392 --> 00:52:59.381
We thought you were
abducted by that heart throb.

585
00:53:00.392 --> 00:53:02.355
What heart throb?

586
00:53:02.356 --> 00:53:04.341
You didn't
see him at the counter?

587
00:53:04.345 --> 00:53:05.355
He was gorgeous.

588
00:53:06.413 --> 00:53:08.388
I miss everything.

589
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:10.345
Your button's undone.

590
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:12.371
Oh thank you.

591
00:53:17.342 --> 00:53:18.425
That's him.

592
00:53:27.383 --> 00:53:29.370
I guess
I could see the appeal.

593
00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:32.378
Well if he looked at me twice,
I would be on my back in a second.

594
00:53:32.382 --> 00:53:33.356
Oh you would not.

595
00:53:33.366 --> 00:53:34.422
Oh I would so. Why not?

596
00:53:35.333 --> 00:53:37.422
Well a couple of reasons:
Adam for one, your kids for another...

597
00:53:38.326 --> 00:53:40.402
Well you know, Tracy...
They wouldn't have to know about it.

598
00:53:41.369 --> 00:53:43.369
It could be just
something that I did for myself

599
00:53:43.369 --> 00:53:46.396
you know, to broaden my horizons.

600
00:53:46.407 --> 00:53:48.389
It'd be like
taking a pottery class.

601
00:53:48.411 --> 00:53:51.410
Having an affair is
nothing like taking a pottery class.

602
00:53:51.411 --> 00:53:54.351
- It could be.
- No. It would start out like that

603
00:53:54.355 --> 00:53:56.402
and then something would happen.

604
00:53:56.412 --> 00:53:59.414
Someone finds out
or someone falls in love

605
00:53:59.418 --> 00:54:01.414
and it ends disastrously.

606
00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:05.412
They always end disastrously.

607
00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:16.340
Tracy!

608
00:54:17.381 --> 00:54:19.357
No.

609
00:54:19.368 --> 00:54:20.407
When?

610
00:54:21.398 --> 00:54:23.373
It was a long time ago

611
00:54:24.335 --> 00:54:28.326
and it's the one thing in my life
I would undo if I could.

612
00:54:36.327 --> 00:54:38.410
Did you just
fuck me across the street?

613
00:54:40.325 --> 00:54:41.385
I did.

614
00:54:42.376 --> 00:54:45.398
You know, we could end this now
and no one would get hurt.

615
00:54:45.401 --> 00:54:47.363
Yeah?

616
00:54:47.372 --> 00:54:52.339
I think, if we ended this now...
I'd get hurt.

617
00:54:52.382 --> 00:54:55.358
So no matter what,
someone get's hurt?

618
00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:57.322
Maybe not.

619
00:54:57.373 --> 00:54:59.393
Maybe we'll get
tired of each other.

620
00:55:00.342 --> 00:55:02.369
God! I hope I get tired of you.

621
00:55:07.366 --> 00:55:09.352
You're in my mind.

622
00:55:09.383 --> 00:55:14.410
You're the only thing in my mind
when I wake up every morning.

623
00:55:16.337 --> 00:55:19.350
You're in my brain
before I even open my eyes.

624
00:55:19.363 --> 00:55:21.334
What do you think of?

625
00:55:21.343 --> 00:55:22.407
It depends.

626
00:55:22.408 --> 00:55:25.368
If it's a day when I don't know
if I'm going to get to see you.

627
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:31.380
I'm anxious, thinking of excuses
to come into the city and see you.

628
00:55:35.387 --> 00:55:37.396
And the days you know we'll meet?

629
00:55:37.406 --> 00:55:39.364
On those days

630
00:55:40.404 --> 00:55:42.353
I'm

631
00:55:43.322 --> 00:55:44.360
calm

632
00:55:44.364 --> 00:55:46.407
and hating myself.

633
00:55:50.318 --> 00:55:51.389
Oh God!

634
00:55:56.408 --> 00:55:59.366
This is what we have over here

635
00:55:59.397 --> 00:56:03.359
and I'll have it
ready for you this afternoon.

636
00:56:03.364 --> 00:56:05.339
That happens all the time.

637
00:56:06.348 --> 00:56:08.371
Ed, what's up?
It sounded important.

638
00:56:10.368 --> 00:56:13.335
I've heard you're
talking with Dunbar and Brinks

639
00:56:13.346 --> 00:56:14.408
and a few other companies.

640
00:56:15.319 --> 00:56:17.335
Oh yeah?
Where'd you hear that?

641
00:56:18.383 --> 00:56:21.412
Well look.
I mean, I suppose they could be

642
00:56:21.413 --> 00:56:23.403
wooing me,
if that's what you mean.

643
00:56:23.407 --> 00:56:27.330
Apparently a lot of people
are wooing you these days.

644
00:56:27.361 --> 00:56:29.356
Now who's wooing who?

645
00:56:29.357 --> 00:56:31.412
Wait.
What are you talking about?

646
00:56:32.323 --> 00:56:34.329
So I talked to
some people. So what?

647
00:56:34.329 --> 00:56:36.356
This is about loyalty, Bill.

648
00:56:36.396 --> 00:56:38.367
I'm letting you go.

649
00:56:38.371 --> 00:56:41.362
You'll have
my recommendation if you need it.

650
00:56:44.334 --> 00:56:46.346
I have a family, Ed.

651
00:56:46.397 --> 00:56:49.345
You had a family here.

652
00:56:49.345 --> 00:56:53.361
Wait a minute.
You're telling me about family!

653
00:56:54.314 --> 00:56:57.315
Well you don't know
the first God damned thing about it.

654
00:57:01.397 --> 00:57:04.369
Why don't you take a look at
your own fucking family, Ed?

655
00:57:04.384 --> 00:57:07.341
Take a God damned look at that.

656
00:57:25.402 --> 00:57:27.385
- Hi, Ed.
- Frank.

657
00:57:30.379 --> 00:57:33.348
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

658
00:57:33.399 --> 00:57:36.339
This is personal.
It's not business.

659
00:57:37.329 --> 00:57:38.359
So you think about it.

660
00:57:38.363 --> 00:57:40.395
I don't know if you're going to
want to get involved with this

661
00:57:40.396 --> 00:57:43.335
but I need someone I can trust.

662
00:57:43.345 --> 00:57:45.364
I want you to follow somebody.

663
00:57:46.365 --> 00:57:47.395
I

664
00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:52.318
I want you to follow my wife.

665
00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:04.332
It's burning, mom.

666
00:58:04.343 --> 00:58:05.343
What?

667
00:58:05.367 --> 00:58:08.312
It's burning... the chicken.

668
00:58:08.314 --> 00:58:09.374
Oh shit!

669
00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:13.382
Shit

670
00:58:22.333 --> 00:58:24.306
It's boiling, mom.

671
00:58:24.307 --> 00:58:25.363
It's boiling!

672
00:58:25.364 --> 00:58:26.379
Thank you.

673
00:58:30.391 --> 00:58:32.403
Watch it.

674
00:58:45.387 --> 00:58:48.339
The chicken's
a little dry. I'm sorry.

675
00:58:48.371 --> 00:58:49.373
It's fine.

676
00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:57.348
I have to
go to Chicago tomorrow.

677
00:58:59.331 --> 00:59:00.370
For how long?

678
00:59:00.371 --> 00:59:02.374
Not long.
Probably just a night.

679
00:59:02.374 --> 00:59:04.351
What time's your flight?

680
00:59:04.382 --> 00:59:06.341
8:00

681
00:59:07.365 --> 00:59:09.325
a.m.

682
00:59:12.342 --> 00:59:15.352
Diane Dryer's son
is marrying Amy Lynne's daughter.

683
00:59:15.356 --> 00:59:17.379
I'm never getting married.

684
00:59:18.318 --> 00:59:19.318
Why not?

685
00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:21.332
I hate girls.

686
00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:25.362
Well
you might change your mind.

687
00:59:25.362 --> 00:59:27.352
That happens sometimes.

688
00:59:27.362 --> 00:59:29.310
I won't.

689
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:34.370
What?

690
00:59:35.364 --> 00:59:37.373
I fired Bill Stone today.

691
00:59:38.344 --> 00:59:40.323
So that's what's bothering you.

692
00:59:40.326 --> 00:59:42.313
Nothing's bothering me.

693
00:59:42.314 --> 00:59:44.313
Why did you fire him?

694
00:59:46.315 --> 00:59:47.348
He's not accountable.

695
00:59:47.358 --> 00:59:50.301
What's accountable?

696
00:59:50.312 --> 00:59:52.341
Is it,
like, people who eat people?

697
00:59:53.301 --> 00:59:55.386
No. That's a cannibal.

698
00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:01.319
Anyway
I can't trust him anymore.

699
01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:04.343
So if you
run into Dolly, you'll know.

700
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:23.309
Well how are you going to clean up the area
so pedestrians can get through?

701
01:01:41.294 --> 01:01:42.310
What?

702
01:01:42.351 --> 01:01:43.391
I can't believe you.

703
01:01:44.351 --> 01:01:46.315
What are you doing?

704
01:02:12.371 --> 01:02:14.297
Shit!

705
01:02:14.299 --> 01:02:15.299
Charlie

706
01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.359
Shit!

707
01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:34.290
Come on!

708
01:02:55.374 --> 01:02:58.297
I'm so sorry.

709
01:02:58.307 --> 01:02:59.336
I'm sorry.

710
01:02:59.346 --> 01:03:01.306
Honey, are you OK?

711
01:03:01.317 --> 01:03:03.309
You must have been so worried.

712
01:03:03.309 --> 01:03:04.338
- Stop, mom.
- What?

713
01:03:04.338 --> 01:03:06.316
- People can see.
- OK.

714
01:03:29.342 --> 01:03:31.288
Hi. This is Paul Martel.

715
01:03:31.299 --> 01:03:32.378
Leave a message
after the beep. Thanks.

716
01:03:33.288 --> 01:03:34.298
Mom?

717
01:03:34.308 --> 01:03:36.288
Honey.

718
01:03:36.359 --> 01:03:38.346
You're supposed to be in bed.

719
01:03:39.306 --> 01:03:40.379
You're crying, mom.

720
01:03:40.379 --> 01:03:42.358
Oh honey.

721
01:03:43.329 --> 01:03:45.378
Mommy's
just a little sad. That's all.

722
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:48.312
Come on.
I'll take you to bed.

723
01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.342
Let's get you into bed.

724
01:03:50.353 --> 01:03:52.289
Don't be sad, mom.

725
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.316
Dad will be home tomorrow.

726
01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:05.345
His name is Paul Martel.

727
01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:14.295
He lives at
433 Mercer Street, apartment 3.

728
01:04:14.379 --> 01:04:17.297
She sees him during the day.

729
01:04:18.335 --> 01:04:20.339
She usually
goes around lunchtime.

730
01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.373
She stays
about 2 hours, maybe 3.

731
01:04:37.314 --> 01:04:39.350
Do they go to the movies?

732
01:04:40.311 --> 01:04:43.283
They did, that day.
Otherwise they're in his apartment.

733
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:58.320
Pick up!

734
01:06:21.304 --> 01:06:22.336
Hey, lady!

735
01:06:23.338 --> 01:06:25.284
You forgot your keys.

736
01:07:06.346 --> 01:07:07.322
Wait!

737
01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:11.294
Who is she?

738
01:07:11.325 --> 01:07:12.292
No!

739
01:07:12.301 --> 01:07:13.292
Calm down!

740
01:07:14.319 --> 01:07:15.349
Why are you doing this?

741
01:07:19.275 --> 01:07:21.315
How many are there? 5? 10?

742
01:07:23.296 --> 01:07:25.271
God! What am I?

743
01:07:25.282 --> 01:07:27.302
The Monday one.
What? Did I get my day wrong?

744
01:07:27.319 --> 01:07:29.325
She's just a friend. OK?

745
01:07:29.336 --> 01:07:31.284
Just a friend.

746
01:07:32.287 --> 01:07:34.286
You're a fucking liar.

747
01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:36.336
Me? I'm the liar?

748
01:07:36.347 --> 01:07:38.327
I can't do this anymore.

749
01:07:41.354 --> 01:07:43.362
Fine. Go back
to your suburban carpool

750
01:07:43.364 --> 01:07:45.288
your tennis dress on your

751
01:07:45.298 --> 01:07:47.297
What are you doing?

752
01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:49.293
Fuck you!

753
01:07:49.355 --> 01:07:51.278
That'll make you happy.

754
01:07:51.279 --> 01:07:52.325
Fuck you!

755
01:07:59.361 --> 01:08:00.305
No.

756
01:08:00.315 --> 01:08:02.281
No, I can't.

757
01:08:02.292 --> 01:08:04.289
Paul, it's over.

758
01:08:06.355 --> 01:08:07.362
I can't!

759
01:08:14.328 --> 01:08:16.337
I hate you.

760
01:08:16.337 --> 01:08:17.297
I know.

761
01:08:17.308 --> 01:08:19.310
Stop it. I can't.

762
01:08:40.269 --> 01:08:41.319
Are you going to fuck me?

763
01:08:41.321 --> 01:08:42.326
Do you want it?

764
01:08:42.336 --> 01:08:43.349
Yeah, I want you to.

765
01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:44.353
Say it.

766
01:08:44.362 --> 01:08:46.303
- I want you to fuck me.
- Say it.

767
01:08:46.313 --> 01:08:48.296
I want you to fuck me.

768
01:10:40.343 --> 01:10:42.283
Oh thank you.

769
01:10:42.293 --> 01:10:43.326
Thank you very much.

770
01:10:43.337 --> 01:10:46.267
Thank you
very much indeed.

771
01:11:07.322 --> 01:11:08.325
Yes?

772
01:11:10.346 --> 01:11:12.256
You're Paul Martel?

773
01:11:12.259 --> 01:11:13.286
Yes.

774
01:11:14.287 --> 01:11:15.329
How old are you?

775
01:11:18.337 --> 01:11:20.257
Who are you?

776
01:11:21.257 --> 01:11:22.320
Edward Sumner:

777
01:11:24.317 --> 01:11:26.310
Connie's husband.

778
01:11:33.285 --> 01:11:35.274
May I

779
01:11:35.304 --> 01:11:36.347
May I come in?

780
01:11:38.342 --> 01:11:41.264
Yeah. Sure.

781
01:12:09.318 --> 01:12:11.298
Would you like a drink?

782
01:12:11.318 --> 01:12:13.295
Yeah. Why not?

783
01:12:24.278 --> 01:12:28.250
I have
scotch, vodka... prune juice

784
01:12:28.274 --> 01:12:30.260
Vodka.

785
01:12:31.314 --> 01:12:33.260
Is it cold?

786
01:12:34.271 --> 01:12:35.300
Yeah.

787
01:12:37.251 --> 01:12:39.264
I keep it in the freezer.

788
01:12:39.275 --> 01:12:42.275
So do I, at home.

789
01:12:59.313 --> 01:13:02.279
So tell me. How did you

790
01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:04.248
meet my wife?

791
01:13:05.308 --> 01:13:07.294
By accident

792
01:13:07.335 --> 01:13:09.307
on the street.

793
01:13:10.249 --> 01:13:12.301
There was a wind storm.
She hooked her knee.

794
01:13:12.305 --> 01:13:14.315
Oh. You're him.

795
01:13:15.336 --> 01:13:17.292
She told you about that?

796
01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:18.305
Yes.

797
01:13:24.287 --> 01:13:25.323
How's it going?

798
01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:29.286
Fine.

799
01:13:30.256 --> 01:13:31.326
Fine... I mean, OK.

800
01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:34.292
This is where you meet?

801
01:13:34.293 --> 01:13:35.333
Yes.

802
01:13:36.334 --> 01:13:38.279
She likes it?

803
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.317
Well I guess.
She never complained.

804
01:13:44.278 --> 01:13:47.344
Do you stay in all the time,
or do you go out too?

805
01:13:49.285 --> 01:13:52.275
It depends.
Sometimes yes, we go out.

806
01:13:52.278 --> 01:13:53.334
She likes that?

807
01:13:53.338 --> 01:13:55.271
She

808
01:13:55.341 --> 01:13:58.253
likes this neighborhood?

809
01:13:58.255 --> 01:13:59.286
Oh yeah.

810
01:13:59.287 --> 01:14:01.337
More exciting
than the suburbs, I guess.

811
01:14:06.271 --> 01:14:10.254
Do you know that
we have been married 11 years?

812
01:14:11.245 --> 01:14:12.318
We have a son.

813
01:14:14.292 --> 01:14:16.285
Yeah, she told me.

814
01:14:19.275 --> 01:14:20.301
More?

815
01:14:21.292 --> 01:14:23.251
Yes, please.

816
01:14:36.262 --> 01:14:38.329
He's the reason
that we left the city.

817
01:14:39.299 --> 01:14:42.298
Connie thought
it would be better for him.

818
01:14:42.301 --> 01:14:44.310
Oh. She told me
it was your idea.

819
01:14:47.266 --> 01:14:50.315
You talk about me?

820
01:15:09.337 --> 01:15:11.304
A lot of books.

821
01:15:11.334 --> 01:15:14.327
Yeah. A lot of
buying and selling.

822
01:15:55.258 --> 01:15:57.261
I didn't know it did that.

823
01:16:03.269 --> 01:16:04.328
Where did you get this?

824
01:16:05.249 --> 01:16:06.279
It was a gift.

825
01:16:07.238 --> 01:16:08.278
From her.

826
01:16:21.314 --> 01:16:23.295
Why would she do that?

827
01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:25.263
I don't know.

828
01:16:26.253 --> 01:16:29.324
Maybe she just
wanted to buy me something.

829
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:37.263
She didn't buy this for you.
I gave it to her.

830
01:16:45.273 --> 01:16:46.302
I gave it to her.

831
01:16:47.234 --> 01:16:48.263
What?

832
01:16:49.331 --> 01:16:51.273
I gave it to her.

833
01:16:51.284 --> 01:16:54.240
I gave... I'm

834
01:16:56.268 --> 01:17:00.258
I'm feeling sick. I can't.

835
01:17:00.268 --> 01:17:02.238
Do you want some water?

836
01:17:03.278 --> 01:17:06.291
I'm feeling sick. I'm

837
01:17:07.262 --> 01:17:08.299
I don't.

838
01:17:12.268 --> 01:17:15.233
I'm not well.

839
01:17:15.275 --> 01:17:17.237
I'm not feeling well.

840
01:17:22.258 --> 01:17:24.234
I'm not

841
01:17:24.284 --> 01:17:26.250
I'm not feeling

842
01:18:24.271 --> 01:18:25.321
God!

843
01:21:03.303 --> 01:21:05.216
Hi. This is Paul Martel.

844
01:21:05.237 --> 01:21:08.233
Leave a message
after the beep. Thanks.

845
01:21:08.264 --> 01:21:10.240
Hi. It's me.

846
01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:11.284
Listen.

847
01:21:13.271 --> 01:21:17.217
I don't like
saying this to your machine but

848
01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:20.304
I have to end this.

849
01:21:24.214 --> 01:21:27.293
I just... I can't do it anymore.

850
01:21:27.298 --> 01:21:30.281
I can't live like this.

851
01:21:30.292 --> 01:21:35.223
I'm so tired of
lying and hurting my family.

852
01:21:36.234 --> 01:21:37.304
I'm sorry.

853
01:21:38.245 --> 01:21:43.227
I hope...
I don't know what I hope.

854
01:21:44.218 --> 01:21:45.304
I'm sorry.

855
01:22:53.305 --> 01:22:56.218
Messages erased.

856
01:23:10.237 --> 01:23:11.253
Does that pinch?

857
01:23:11.264 --> 01:23:13.216
No.

858
01:23:13.228 --> 01:23:15.213
Do you know your solo?

859
01:23:15.214 --> 01:23:15.294
- Yes.
- Yeah?

860
01:23:15.295 --> 01:23:18.244
Can I hear it?

861
01:24:47.251 --> 01:24:48.239
Do you need a hand?

862
01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.040
No.

863
01:24:49.201 --> 01:24:50.250
No, I'm fine.

864
01:24:50.272 --> 01:24:52.224
Thanks.

890
01:27:53.275 --> 01:27:56.204
You were spectacular.
Do you know that?

891
01:27:57.228 --> 01:28:00.187
- Wasn't he great, Edward?
- Great.

892
01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:02.273
He was great

893
01:28:03.253 --> 01:28:05.208
really great.

894
01:28:05.275 --> 01:28:07.201
I have to help clean up.

895
01:28:07.202 --> 01:28:09.285
I'll come and kiss you good night
later when I get home. OK?

896
01:28:18.259 --> 01:28:19.282
Sorry, Ed.

897
01:28:20.193 --> 01:28:22.192
It looks like I nailed you.

898
01:28:24.233 --> 01:28:26.263
It's all right, Jerry. It's OK.

899
01:28:32.271 --> 01:28:35.206
You'd better check
to see if this is going to open.

900
01:28:35.216 --> 01:28:36.255
No, this is fine.

901
01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:39.226
It's nothing. It's fine.

902
01:28:43.246 --> 01:28:45.197
Did he dent you, dad?

903
01:28:45.248 --> 01:28:48.185
Yes, he did.

904
01:28:48.195 --> 01:28:50.232
Can we call the cops, dad?

905
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:54.218
Are you sure you don't
want to check the trunk?

906
01:28:54.219 --> 01:28:56.210
- We'll deal with it tomorrow.
- It'll just take a second.

907
01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:57.210
No!

908
01:32:03.254 --> 01:32:05.190
Oh my God!

909
01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:06.240
Charlie

910
01:32:06.249 --> 01:32:09.229
look at your dad
and tell me what's wrong.

911
01:32:11.251 --> 01:32:13.193
What?

912
01:32:14.251 --> 01:32:16.207
His shoes!

913
01:32:16.258 --> 01:32:18.264
They're different colors.

914
01:32:26.215 --> 01:32:28.180
Honey, you look awful.

915
01:32:28.241 --> 01:32:30.204
What happened last night?
Did you sleep?

916
01:32:30.205 --> 01:32:32.241
I got up and looked for you.

917
01:32:32.242 --> 01:32:34.255
Oh I just

918
01:32:36.185 --> 01:32:38.181
got some air.

919
01:32:38.192 --> 01:32:39.259
Are you OK?

920
01:32:41.179 --> 01:32:42.243
Yeah.

921
01:32:54.212 --> 01:32:56.241
Do you like it here, Connie?

922
01:32:56.242 --> 01:32:58.182
What?

923
01:32:59.182 --> 01:33:00.209
Of course I like it here.

924
01:33:00.213 --> 01:33:01.236
'Cause we don't
have to stay here.

925
01:33:01.237 --> 01:33:04.186
We can
move back to the city.

926
01:33:05.236 --> 01:33:08.241
Honey,
what has gotten into you?

927
01:33:10.245 --> 01:33:12.206
Are you OK?

928
01:33:13.176 --> 01:33:15.233
Yeah, I'm fine.

929
01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.245
Are you OK?

930
01:33:19.257 --> 01:33:22.176
I'm fine.

931
01:33:22.227 --> 01:33:26.200
Everybody's fine
and we're not moving anywhere.

932
01:34:08.236 --> 01:34:10.228
The cops are here, mom.

933
01:34:12.186 --> 01:34:13.233
What do they want?

934
01:34:13.233 --> 01:34:15.229
I'm sure it's nothing.

935
01:34:22.210 --> 01:34:24.230
N.Y.P.D., mom.

936
01:34:26.208 --> 01:34:27.197
Hello.

937
01:34:27.208 --> 01:34:28.224
- Mrs. Sumner
- Yes.

938
01:34:28.233 --> 01:34:30.170
Yeah. I'm Detective Dean.

939
01:34:30.171 --> 01:34:31.220
This is Detective Mirojnick.

940
01:34:31.231 --> 01:34:33.175
New York City Police Department.

941
01:34:33.177 --> 01:34:34.203
Did something happen?
Is something wrong?

942
01:34:34.204 --> 01:34:35.237
Oh no.

943
01:34:35.238 --> 01:34:37.258
Do you know a Paul Martel?

944
01:34:38.218 --> 01:34:42.201
Yes, not very well. Why?

945
01:34:42.211 --> 01:34:44.168
Do you know where he is?

946
01:34:45.238 --> 01:34:47.199
No.

947
01:34:49.238 --> 01:34:52.159
At home, I would imagine.

948
01:34:52.179 --> 01:34:53.236
Do you know where he lives?

949
01:34:54.166 --> 01:34:56.186
Soho, wasn't it?

950
01:34:57.177 --> 01:35:00.194
Your name and number
were found on his desk.

951
01:35:02.194 --> 01:35:03.246
Has he done something wrong?

952
01:35:03.247 --> 01:35:07.181
Well we don't know. He's been
reported missing by his family.

953
01:35:07.204 --> 01:35:09.174
His wife doesn't know where he is.

954
01:35:13.162 --> 01:35:14.245
I didn't know he was married.

955
01:35:16.162 --> 01:35:17.211
Separated.

956
01:35:22.183 --> 01:35:23.248
When did you see him last?

957
01:35:26.167 --> 01:35:28.231
I don't know.
It's hard to say.

958
01:35:30.251 --> 01:35:32.227
He's a book dealer.

959
01:35:32.238 --> 01:35:35.254
I barely know him at all. I was
going to buy some books from him.

960
01:35:36.175 --> 01:35:36.251
And did you?

961
01:35:37.161 --> 01:35:39.211
No, not yet.

962
01:35:42.212 --> 01:35:45.204
Has something happened to him?
I mean, do you think he's all right?

963
01:35:45.208 --> 01:35:47.205
It's hard to say at this point.

964
01:35:48.215 --> 01:35:49.255
We're working on it.

965
01:35:51.235 --> 01:35:54.176
Anyway thanks for your time.

966
01:35:54.216 --> 01:35:55.235
Thank you.

967
01:35:55.246 --> 01:35:58.232
I like these snow glass things.

968
01:35:58.233 --> 01:36:00.159
My boy has some of these.

969
01:36:00.170 --> 01:36:02.188
If you hear from Mr. Martel,
let us know.

970
01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:03.225
Certainly.

971
01:36:31.204 --> 01:36:34.171
Dad! The cops
came to our house today.

972
01:36:36.181 --> 01:36:38.207
The cops!
What did they want?

973
01:36:42.241 --> 01:36:46.247
Someone's missing and they have to
check everyone. You know.

974
01:36:51.218 --> 01:36:52.241
Who was it?

975
01:36:53.242 --> 01:36:55.218
Honey, sit up straight.

976
01:36:58.239 --> 01:36:59.245
Who was it?

977
01:36:59.246 --> 01:37:01.155
I don't think you know him.

978
01:37:01.166 --> 01:37:03.224
He's... He sells books.

979
01:37:04.215 --> 01:37:06.202
I forget where I met him.

980
01:37:07.212 --> 01:37:09.204
Was it a bad guy, mom?

981
01:37:12.151 --> 01:37:15.167
So what did they...
Why did they want to talk to you?

982
01:37:15.235 --> 01:37:18.241
I guess...
He had my name and number.

983
01:37:20.172 --> 01:37:22.202
Why would he
have your number?

984
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:26.169
I think
I bought a book from him.

985
01:37:38.213 --> 01:37:40.156
Be careful.

986
01:37:40.157 --> 01:37:41.167
Hey, Charlie.

987
01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:43.162
Hi, darling.

988
01:37:43.173 --> 01:37:45.189
Oh I wish
you lived closer.

989
01:37:49.187 --> 01:37:53.225
Lord, bless this food
to our use and us to thy service.

990
01:37:54.170 --> 01:37:58.172
and help us to be
ever mindful of the needs of others.

991
01:37:58.176 --> 01:37:58.223
Amen.

992
01:37:58.233 --> 01:38:01.169
Amen.

993
01:38:01.179 --> 01:38:03.189
Edward!

994
01:38:13.174 --> 01:38:14.227
All right!

995
01:38:23.182 --> 01:38:25.231
I have a story
you don't know about Edward.

996
01:38:25.242 --> 01:38:27.191
He was at the club.

997
01:39:15.173 --> 01:39:17.156
Hello, Mrs. Sumner.

998
01:39:17.167 --> 01:39:19.220
I'm sorry to
bother you on the weekend.

999
01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:21.219
I'm Detective Dean.

1000
01:39:21.227 --> 01:39:23.206
This is
Detective Mirojnick, N.Y.P.D.

1001
01:39:23.207 --> 01:39:24.177
OK.

1002
01:39:24.187 --> 01:39:27.145
We were hoping to
talk to you for a few minutes.

1003
01:39:27.164 --> 01:39:29.177
Sure.

1004
01:39:29.188 --> 01:39:31.202
Charlie, we're going to
go up on the porch for a minute.

1005
01:39:31.204 --> 01:39:32.193
Can I come?

1006
01:39:32.204 --> 01:39:34.200
No, sweetheart.
You stay out here.

1007
01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:36.204
Play with Poppy.
We'll be right back.

1008
01:39:38.144 --> 01:39:39.191
I don't know if
your wife mentioned...

1009
01:39:39.192 --> 01:39:41.204
We were here
about a week and a half ago

1010
01:39:41.214 --> 01:39:43.166
about Paul Martel.

1011
01:39:43.177 --> 01:39:45.206
Yeah, that was
the man who was missing.

1012
01:39:45.207 --> 01:39:47.231
Well he's
not missing anymore.

1013
01:39:48.143 --> 01:39:50.218
His body
was discovered last weekend.

1014
01:39:51.209 --> 01:39:54.160
God! That's terrible.

1015
01:39:56.151 --> 01:39:57.214
Oh my God!

1016
01:39:57.218 --> 01:40:02.154
Do you recall where
you met Mr. Martel, Mrs. Sumner?

1017
01:40:03.155 --> 01:40:05.221
- I told you
- No, madam. You didn't.

1018
01:40:05.235 --> 01:40:07.227
I'm sorry.

1019
01:40:08.157 --> 01:40:10.158
I can't remember.

1020
01:40:10.209 --> 01:40:12.204
A fund-raiser, I think.

1021
01:40:12.207 --> 01:40:14.169
Can you be more specific?

1022
01:40:14.199 --> 01:40:16.166
Juilliard.

1023
01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:19.203
Juilliard.

1024
01:40:20.183 --> 01:40:21.168
The music school.

1025
01:40:22.142 --> 01:40:24.144
Yes, I know what Juilliard is.

1026
01:40:24.145 --> 01:40:26.158
Oh, of course you do. I'm sorry.

1027
01:40:26.159 --> 01:40:28.162
Were you there too, sir?

1028
01:40:29.222 --> 01:40:32.159
Yes. I think I was.

1029
01:40:32.198 --> 01:40:35.161
Well maybe you met Mr. Martel

1030
01:40:36.232 --> 01:40:39.146
No, not that I remember.

1031
01:40:39.148 --> 01:40:40.209
Maybe you'd recognize him.

1032
01:40:42.156 --> 01:40:44.213
No. I've never met him before.

1033
01:40:44.215 --> 01:40:47.169
- Is that him?
- Yes.

1034
01:40:48.167 --> 01:40:50.170
Have you ever
been to his apartment?

1035
01:40:51.150 --> 01:40:52.188
No.

1036
01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.199
No, I hardly knew him.

1037
01:40:54.203 --> 01:40:56.232
I didn't even know
why he had my phone number.

1038
01:40:56.233 --> 01:40:58.169
Maybe he liked you.

1039
01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.157
Look. I think that's enough.

1040
01:41:03.207 --> 01:41:05.209
So you've
never been to his apartment

1041
01:41:05.212 --> 01:41:09.140
Well how about the neighborhood...
Did you hang out down there?

1042
01:41:09.141 --> 01:41:11.216
- No.
- No, not often

1043
01:41:11.217 --> 01:41:14.200
- ...or no, never
- Never.

1044
01:41:14.207 --> 01:41:17.146
I can't remember
the last time I was in Soho.

1045
01:41:17.148 --> 01:41:19.167
It was 4 weeks ago actually.

1046
01:41:21.211 --> 01:41:24.186
You got a parking ticket
right in front of Martel's apartment

1047
01:41:24.188 --> 01:41:25.220
4 weeks ago.

1048
01:41:25.223 --> 01:41:28.140
Oh that. Right.

1049
01:41:28.141 --> 01:41:31.197
I had coffee
with friends at a little place.

1050
01:41:31.198 --> 01:41:32.198
I forgot.

1051
01:41:32.201 --> 01:41:36.135
- It was Tracy and Sally,
- Oh yeah. Yes. Yeah.

1052
01:41:48.152 --> 01:41:49.168
Look.

1053
01:41:51.159 --> 01:41:54.218
My wife has told you
everything she knows. So have I so

1054
01:41:55.186 --> 01:41:58.165
if you don't mind,
we'd like to get back to our son.

1055
01:41:58.168 --> 01:42:00.187
All right.

1056
01:42:00.198 --> 01:42:03.135
Why don't I give you my card.

1057
01:42:03.138 --> 01:42:04.191
I have your card.

1058
01:42:06.132 --> 01:42:07.148
Right.

1059
01:42:08.196 --> 01:42:10.219
- Enjoy your weekend
- You too.

1060
01:43:06.205 --> 01:43:08.180
Sumner, please.

1061
01:43:47.173 --> 01:43:49.149
Oh my God!

1062
01:43:50.213 --> 01:43:52.203
Hi, Connie.

1063
01:43:53.164 --> 01:43:55.160
Hi, Tracy.

1064
01:43:55.171 --> 01:43:58.197
I'm just picking up
my silk suit for tonight.

1065
01:44:00.193 --> 01:44:03.132
I was thinking of
wearing the black.

1066
01:44:15.167 --> 01:44:17.140
I'm going to
give up the good row.

1067
01:44:17.141 --> 01:44:20.133
Let someone else
be gorgeous for a change.

1068
01:44:24.132 --> 01:44:27.181
So what should we bring
aside from our sparkling personalities?

1069
01:44:32.145 --> 01:44:33.161
How are we doing?

1070
01:44:33.202 --> 01:44:35.124
Fine.

1071
01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:36.144
Do you need help?

1072
01:44:36.145 --> 01:44:37.184
No.

1073
01:44:39.202 --> 01:44:44.121
The white is not cold
so I'm going to put it in the freezer.

1074
01:44:45.152 --> 01:44:47.218
Just remind me
it's in there. All right?

1075
01:44:50.152 --> 01:44:52.150
Most people drink red anyway.

1076
01:44:57.159 --> 01:44:58.195
Oh I love these things.

1077
01:44:58.205 --> 01:45:00.195
Is there
any place you guys haven't been?

1078
01:45:00.196 --> 01:45:04.169
The Rosenthals
got 795 for their place.

1079
01:45:04.179 --> 01:45:06.128
In 2 days they had 6 offers:

1080
01:45:06.129 --> 01:45:08.121
sealed bids.
That's what everyone's doing now.

1081
01:45:08.125 --> 01:45:09.215
What do you think
this place is worth, Ed?

1082
01:45:10.166 --> 01:45:12.165
Oh I don't know.

1083
01:45:12.176 --> 01:45:14.196
You sell your house,
and where do you go?

1084
01:45:14.199 --> 01:45:16.172
At those prices, Tahiti.

1085
01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:17.205
Bangkok.

1086
01:45:17.216 --> 01:45:20.152
Connie, where's this one from?

1087
01:45:30.187 --> 01:45:32.180
Fiji.

1088
01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:35.194
Oh remember, Jeff?
I asked you to take me to Fiji

1089
01:45:36.184 --> 01:45:37.214
and then you took me to Hawaii.

1090
01:45:38.124 --> 01:45:40.120
We went fishing every single day.

1091
01:46:04.123 --> 01:46:05.199
What happened, Edward?

1092
01:46:08.193 --> 01:46:10.187
What did you do?

1093
01:46:12.137 --> 01:46:13.189
Did you hurt him?

1094
01:46:18.138 --> 01:46:19.181
Edward?

1095
01:46:20.211 --> 01:46:22.181
Did you hurt him?

1096
01:46:25.148 --> 01:46:26.208
You did, didn't you?

1097
01:46:27.199 --> 01:46:31.155
Oh Jesus, Edward!

1098
01:46:33.125 --> 01:46:35.112
Talk to me.

1099
01:46:35.152 --> 01:46:37.191
Tell me what you did.

1100
01:46:37.195 --> 01:46:41.151
No.
You tell me what you did:

1101
01:46:41.202 --> 01:46:44.202
how you fucked him
over and over and over.

1102
01:46:45.113 --> 01:46:46.186
You lied to me

1103
01:46:46.196 --> 01:46:49.169
over and over and over.

1104
01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:50.199
Edward, please.

1105
01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:53.133
No.
You don't talk to me now.

1106
01:46:53.134 --> 01:46:55.167
I gave everything

1107
01:46:56.147 --> 01:46:58.186
for this family

1108
01:46:59.117 --> 01:47:00.163
everything!

1109
01:47:01.183 --> 01:47:04.170
And what did you do?

1110
01:47:05.141 --> 01:47:07.134
You threw it all away

1111
01:47:07.144 --> 01:47:09.127
like it was nothing.

1112
01:47:09.128 --> 01:47:11.127
For what?

1113
01:47:11.168 --> 01:47:13.180
To a fucking kid!

1114
01:47:22.141 --> 01:47:24.144
You didn't think I'd know?

1115
01:47:24.175 --> 01:47:26.124
That I wouldn't feel it?

1116
01:47:26.127 --> 01:47:28.157
I knew it
from the very first day

1117
01:47:30.185 --> 01:47:32.175
because I know you, Connie.

1118
01:47:32.178 --> 01:47:35.143
I know you
and I fucking hate you!

1119
01:47:35.144 --> 01:47:38.160
I didn't want to kill him.
I wanted to kill you!

1120
01:47:41.118 --> 01:47:43.184
Oh my God.

1121
01:47:53.141 --> 01:47:57.134
Edward... Oh my God!

1122
01:48:07.156 --> 01:48:09.179
Dear God!

1123
01:48:51.111 --> 01:48:54.174
Mom, look what I did.

1124
01:48:56.192 --> 01:48:59.131
Honey... that's OK.

1125
01:49:00.131 --> 01:49:01.141
That's OK.

1126
01:49:01.182 --> 01:49:03.150
I'm sorry, mom.

1127
01:49:03.153 --> 01:49:05.118
It's an accident.

1128
01:49:05.158 --> 01:49:07.142
Everybody has accidents.

1129
01:49:07.145 --> 01:49:09.200
Why aren't you in bed, mom?

1130
01:49:12.188 --> 01:49:14.141
I don't know.

1131
01:49:18.113 --> 01:49:19.197
Charlie, look at me.

1132
01:49:20.158 --> 01:49:22.134
I want you to know.

1133
01:49:22.164 --> 01:49:26.161
that I love you
more than anything in the world

1134
01:49:29.114 --> 01:49:32.141
and I want you to know
that your daddy and me both

1135
01:49:32.155 --> 01:49:35.124
will always, always love you

1136
01:49:35.135 --> 01:49:38.115
no matter what. Hmm?

1137
01:49:40.186 --> 01:49:43.132
- OK?
- OK.

1138
01:49:44.112 --> 01:49:45.152
Come on, sweetie.

1139
01:49:45.152 --> 01:49:49.195
Let's go and fix up your bed
all nice and fresh. OK?

1140
01:49:50.177 --> 01:49:52.150
All right.

1141
01:51:30.123 --> 01:51:32.153
<i>If you find this
DO NOT OPEN until our 25th anniversary.</i>

1142
01:51:45.132 --> 01:51:49.112
<i>To my beautiful wife
the best part of every day.</i>

1143
01:53:04.097 --> 01:53:06.123
You can come on up
and clean it off, no?.

1144
01:53:06.134 --> 01:53:10.164
Come on! I'm not
an ax murderer. I promise.

1145
01:53:45.130 --> 01:53:46.157
Thank you.

1146
01:54:13.147 --> 01:54:15.180
What are we going to do?

1147
01:54:19.096 --> 01:54:21.103
I'm so scared.

1148
01:54:23.123 --> 01:54:25.132
I'll turn myself in.

1149
01:54:25.163 --> 01:54:27.099
No.

1150
01:54:29.170 --> 01:54:31.139
No.

1151
01:54:40.157 --> 01:54:43.116
No, we can get through this.

1152
01:54:44.167 --> 01:54:47.164
We'll take it
one day at a time.

1153
01:54:49.114 --> 01:54:51.127
No one will know.

1154
01:54:53.107 --> 01:54:55.097
We'll know.

1155
01:55:03.128 --> 01:55:07.084
31, 3.500, 3.800, 4.000.

1156
01:55:07.095 --> 01:55:09.103
42, 45, 4.800.

1157
01:56:36.102 --> 01:56:38.115
We could disappear.

1158
01:56:40.133 --> 01:56:43.094
We could raise
some money, sell everything

1159
01:56:43.105 --> 01:56:45.133
and just leave the country.

1160
01:56:46.155 --> 01:56:48.138
<i>Señorita</i>

1161
01:56:49.149 --> 01:56:51.148
Mexico.

1162
01:56:53.098 --> 01:56:54.163
Why not?

1163
01:56:56.145 --> 01:56:58.165
We could get
a little house on the beach

1164
01:56:59.115 --> 01:57:01.135
and take a different name.

1165
01:57:02.155 --> 01:57:05.090
People do it all the time.

1166
01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:07.160
What do we tell Charlie?

1167
01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:12.140
Tell him it's an adventure.

1168
01:57:15.130 --> 01:57:17.149
We could fish all day.

1169
01:57:21.105 --> 01:57:24.110
We could
learn to play the guitar

1170
01:57:25.149 --> 01:57:30.115
and I would
serenade you to sleep every night.

1171
01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:34.100
We'd just live
the rest of our lives on that beach

1172
01:57:35.090 --> 01:57:39.085
and then when we die
we could just push out to sea.

1173
01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:41.080
What do you think?

1174
01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:45.081
It sounds perfect.
