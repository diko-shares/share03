<i>Welcome to New Tokyo
International Airport. Welcome.</i>

2
00:02:41.797 --> 00:02:43.672
Welcome to Tokyo.
Thank you very much.

3
00:02:43.757 --> 00:02:45.466
My name is Kawasaki.
Nice to meet you.

4
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.009
I've heard of you.
Thank you.

5
00:02:47.052 --> 00:02:48.135
For you.
Thank you.

6
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.179
And Mr. Mori from Suntory. Hi.

7
00:02:50.263 --> 00:02:51.263
And Miss Shibata.

8
00:02:51.348 --> 00:02:52.306
Hey, I need that.

9
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.141
And Mr. Awinami.

10
00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:55.351
Nice to meet you.

11
00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:56.685
All right. Thank you.

12
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.770
And Mr. Tanaka.

13
00:02:57.854 --> 00:02:59.146
Thank you. Thank you.

14
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:01.607
And we will pick you up in the morning?

15
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:02.650
Okay.

16
00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:03.859
Okay. See you tomorrow.

17
00:03:03.944 --> 00:03:06.529
Great. Short and sweet.
Very Japanese. I like that.

18
00:03:06.613 --> 00:03:07.822
My pleasure.

19
00:03:07.906 --> 00:03:09.406
Yeah, get some sleep,
will you?

20
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:11.450
We're all... You're all
really tired, I'm sure.

21
00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:12.576
See you tomorrow.

22
00:03:12.661 --> 00:03:14.495
Good night. Thank you. Thank you.

23
00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.497
Thank you... What's this?

24
00:03:16.665 --> 00:03:18.123
Something good?

25
00:03:25.423 --> 00:03:26.799
Thank you.

26
00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:38.185
Mr. Harris, welcome
to Park Hyatt Tokyo.

27
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.311
Yeah.

28
00:03:39.396 --> 00:03:41.021
This way, please.

29
00:03:42.983 --> 00:03:44.900
Mr. Harris,
pleased to welcome.

30
00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:46.318
Thank you.
Have a nice stay with us.

31
00:03:46.403 --> 00:03:47.862
This way.

32
00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:51.782
Mr. Harris, welcome
to Park Hyatt Tokyo.

33
00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:53.158
Thank you.
Enjoy your stay with us.

34
00:03:53.243 --> 00:03:54.451
Thank you very much.

35
00:04:27.903 --> 00:04:33.032
<i>I'm in your arms</i>

36
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:38.162
<i>And you are kissing me</i>

37
00:04:38.622 --> 00:04:43.167
<i>But there seems to be</i>

38
00:04:44.461 --> 00:04:46.211
Finish this drink,
then we'll go to a jazz club.

39
00:04:46.296 --> 00:04:47.421
Yeah.

40
00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:49.214
You see that guy?

41
00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:50.299
Yeah.

42
00:04:50.383 --> 00:04:51.800
You know who that is?

43
00:04:51.885 --> 00:04:52.927
It's not him.

44
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:55.012
It looks like him,
but it's not him.

45
00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:57.014
Can you believe it?

46
00:04:57.098 --> 00:04:58.140
Okay, maybe it is.

47
00:04:58.224 --> 00:04:59.600
He's here with us. I'm
gonna go talk to him.

48
00:04:59.684 --> 00:05:00.893
Shut up. Shut up.

49
00:05:00.977 --> 00:05:04.021
Bob? Bob Harris?
You're awesome, man!

50
00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:06.106
Sunset Odds. Loved it.

51
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:08.943
Man, that car chase,
I couldn't believe it.

52
00:05:09.027 --> 00:05:11.946
Four buses... And he took that
thing and everything exploded.

53
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.114
I heard he did
his own driving.

54
00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:15.866
Did you do
your own driving?

55
00:05:15.992 --> 00:05:17.326
I did.
Cool.

56
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.786
So, what are you
doing here?

57
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.079
Yeah.

58
00:05:21.873 --> 00:05:23.624
Seeing friends.
Seeing friends.

59
00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:25.626
Yeah?
Great.

60
00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.002
We're here on business.

61
00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:28.587
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>

62
00:05:28.672 --> 00:05:29.880
Later.

63
00:05:29.923 --> 00:05:31.048
See you, Bob.
Keep it up.

64
00:06:32.652 --> 00:06:34.319
Are you awake?

65
00:06:38.783 --> 00:06:40.284
John.

66
00:06:43.288 --> 00:06:44.872
Go to sleep.

67
00:07:51.856 --> 00:07:53.774
Yeah,
I'm coming down.

68
00:07:54.692 --> 00:07:55.734
Okay.

69
00:07:56.903 --> 00:07:58.779
I gotta go to work.

70
00:07:58.863 --> 00:07:59.947
Okay.

71
00:08:00.031 --> 00:08:01.532
I love you.
I'll see you later.

72
00:08:01.616 --> 00:08:02.699
Okay. Bye.

73
00:09:06.014 --> 00:09:07.222
Mr. Bob-san.

74
00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:16.106
Suntory whisky.

75
00:09:29.037 --> 00:09:30.704
Casablanca. Bogie.

76
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.665
Suntory time.

77
00:09:34.584 --> 00:09:37.211
He want you to turn,
look in camera.

78
00:09:37.962 --> 00:09:39.171
Okay?

79
00:09:40.423 --> 00:09:41.548
That's all he said?

80
00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:42.758
Yes.

81
00:09:42.926 --> 00:09:44.259
Turn to camera.

82
00:09:47.138 --> 00:09:50.432
All right, does he want me
to turn from the right,

83
00:09:50.516 --> 00:09:53.227
or turn from the left?

84
00:10:17.502 --> 00:10:20.379
Passionate. Camera. Passion.

85
00:10:20.463 --> 00:10:23.298
Right side and
with intensity.

86
00:10:24.092 --> 00:10:25.092
Okay?

87
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.636
Is that everything? I
mean, it seemed like he said

88
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.346
quite a bit more than that.

89
00:10:30.848 --> 00:10:32.808
Whiskey.

90
00:10:37.105 --> 00:10:38.355
Gently.

91
00:10:40.149 --> 00:10:41.984
Tension.

92
00:10:42.068 --> 00:10:45.153
Like an old friend,
and into the camera.

93
00:10:46.114 --> 00:10:47.239
Okay.

94
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.784
Whiskey.

95
00:10:50.868 --> 00:10:53.787
It's Suntory time! Okay?

96
00:10:54.706 --> 00:10:55.831
Okay.

97
00:10:56.082 --> 00:10:57.207
Okay?

98
00:10:59.294 --> 00:11:00.294
Hey, come on!

99
00:11:00.378 --> 00:11:01.878
Come on,
come on, come on.

100
00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:11.388
For relaxing times,

101
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.349
make it Suntory time.

102
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.020
Cut-o! Cut-o, cut-o,
cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

103
00:11:28.823 --> 00:11:30.198
Could you do it slower

104
00:11:30.283 --> 00:11:33.994
and with more intensity?

105
00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:39.916
Suntory time.

106
00:11:56.434 --> 00:11:58.310
For relaxing times,

107
00:12:00.355 --> 00:12:02.064
make it Suntory time.

108
00:12:06.694 --> 00:12:08.653
Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

109
00:13:26.023 --> 00:13:27.107
<i>Hello?</i>

110
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:28.275
Lauren?

111
00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:29.609
<i>Charlotte! Hey!</i>

112
00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:31.486
Hey.

113
00:13:31.571 --> 00:13:32.821
<i>Oh, my God. How's Tokyo?</i>

114
00:13:32.905 --> 00:13:36.199
It's great here.
It's really great. Um...

115
00:13:36.617 --> 00:13:38.452
I don't know...
I went to this shrine today.

116
00:13:38.536 --> 00:13:39.536
<i>Mmm-hmm?</i>

117
00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.079
And

118
00:13:41.497 --> 00:13:44.416
there were these monks,
and they were chanting.

119
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.503
And I didn't feel anything.
You know?

120
00:13:48.588 --> 00:13:52.007
And I don't know...

121
00:13:52.216 --> 00:13:55.552
I even tried ikebana, and John
is using these hair products.

122
00:13:55.636 --> 00:13:57.387
I just...
I don't know who I married.

123
00:13:57.472 --> 00:13:59.806
<i>Look, can you wait a second?
Just hold on. I'll be right back.</i>

124
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:01.266
Okay, sure.

125
00:14:02.977 --> 00:14:04.895
<i>Sorry. What were you saying?</i>

126
00:14:04.979 --> 00:14:07.022
Nothing. It's okay.
I'll call you later. Okay?

127
00:14:07.106 --> 00:14:11.234
<i>Okay. Have the best time. Just call
me when you get back. Okay? Bye.</i>

128
00:14:11.319 --> 00:14:12.569
<i>Bye.
Love you.</i>

129
00:15:20.137 --> 00:15:21.638
God!

130
00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:23.390
Ow.

131
00:15:26.978 --> 00:15:29.896
At the fitting today,
they had all these

132
00:15:29.981 --> 00:15:31.481
rock-and-roll clothes,

133
00:15:31.566 --> 00:15:33.400
but the band
wasn't tough at all.

134
00:15:33.484 --> 00:15:35.527
The label guy just kept
saying, "More lock and loll,"

135
00:15:35.611 --> 00:15:37.028
but it's just so much better

136
00:15:37.113 --> 00:15:40.240
if they're just skinny and nerdy
like they came in, you know.

137
00:15:40.324 --> 00:15:42.951
They're making them wear all
these Keith Richards clothes,

138
00:15:43.035 --> 00:15:44.327
and it's just ridiculous.

139
00:15:44.412 --> 00:15:47.205
They should let them be who they
are. Don't you think? I mean...

140
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.623
Yeah.

141
00:15:48.708 --> 00:15:50.333
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was saying.

142
00:15:50.418 --> 00:15:53.587
But then you try to...
I mean, you know...

143
00:15:54.505 --> 00:15:56.423
That's what I think.

144
00:15:56.507 --> 00:15:58.508
Do you think this is done?

145
00:16:01.304 --> 00:16:03.763
I don't know. I don't know.

146
00:16:04.932 --> 00:16:08.810
Would you... Would you
please stop smoking?

147
00:16:08.894 --> 00:16:10.812
I like to. I don't really
smoke that much.

148
00:16:10.896 --> 00:16:13.857
It's just so bad
for you, though.

149
00:16:14.025 --> 00:16:15.650
Well, I'll stop later.

150
00:16:28.164 --> 00:16:29.623
Welcome back,
Mr. Harris.

151
00:16:29.707 --> 00:16:30.790
Yes, Mr. Harris.

152
00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:31.875
Please.

153
00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:32.959
Thank you.

154
00:17:14.752 --> 00:17:16.544
Mr. Harris?
Yes?

155
00:17:16.629 --> 00:17:17.796
Mr. Kazu sent me.

156
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.838
Oh?

157
00:17:18.923 --> 00:17:20.382
May I enter?

158
00:17:22.885 --> 00:17:24.010
Thank you.

159
00:17:24.095 --> 00:17:26.054
Do you like massage?

160
00:17:26.138 --> 00:17:29.849
I don't think
I like massage anymore.

161
00:17:29.934 --> 00:17:33.019
Mr. Kazu sends
premium fantasy.

162
00:17:33.938 --> 00:17:37.357
My stockings, lip them.

163
00:17:40.444 --> 00:17:42.696
Lip my stockings.

164
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.615
Yes, please.

165
00:17:46.242 --> 00:17:47.492
Lip them.

166
00:17:49.578 --> 00:17:50.620
What?

167
00:17:50.705 --> 00:17:52.122
Lip them.

168
00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:56.292
Hey! Lip my stocking!

169
00:17:56.377 --> 00:17:58.962
Hey! "Lip" them?
"Lip" them? What?

170
00:17:59.046 --> 00:18:02.048
Lip them. Like this.
Lip them.

171
00:18:02.133 --> 00:18:03.550
Rip them?
Lip, yes.

172
00:18:03.634 --> 00:18:04.968
You want me to rip
your stockings?

173
00:18:05.052 --> 00:18:07.053
Yes, lip my stockings,
please.

174
00:18:07.138 --> 00:18:08.513
Rip your stockings.
Yes.

175
00:18:08.639 --> 00:18:10.557
You want me to rip your
stockings. Please? Please? Please?

176
00:18:10.641 --> 00:18:11.808
All right, I'm gonna
rip your stockings,

177
00:18:11.892 --> 00:18:14.644
and you tell Mr. Kazu
we had a blast.

178
00:18:14.729 --> 00:18:17.480
Oh, no! Mr. Harris!
Oh, my God!

179
00:18:17.565 --> 00:18:19.065
Don't touch me!

180
00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.277
Mr. Bob Harris,
don't touch me!

181
00:18:22.695 --> 00:18:24.320
Just lip my stocking!

182
00:18:24.405 --> 00:18:27.031
Oh, no, Mr. Harris!

183
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.534
Oh, no! Help! Help!

184
00:18:29.618 --> 00:18:30.618
Yeah. Yeah.

185
00:18:30.703 --> 00:18:31.828
Help, please!
Help, please!

186
00:18:31.912 --> 00:18:32.912
Okay.

187
00:18:32.997 --> 00:18:34.914
Mr. Harris, help, please.
Careful with those.

188
00:18:34.999 --> 00:18:36.791
Oh! Help, please!
Help, please!

189
00:18:36.876 --> 00:18:38.877
Come on. Come on.

190
00:18:38.961 --> 00:18:41.296
Let me go, Mr. Harris!

191
00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.547
Oh, no! Let me go!

192
00:18:42.631 --> 00:18:43.631
Come on. Come on.

193
00:18:43.716 --> 00:18:46.009
Oh! Let me go!
Let me go.

194
00:18:46.093 --> 00:18:47.093
Oh, crap.

195
00:18:47.178 --> 00:18:48.261
Please let me go.
With pleasure.

196
00:18:48.345 --> 00:18:52.932
Oh, no, Mr. Bob Harris,
don't let me go! No!

197
00:18:54.185 --> 00:18:57.061
No! Oh, no,
Mr. Bob Harris!

198
00:18:58.481 --> 00:18:59.981
Oh, please.

199
00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:01.441
Let me go, please!

200
00:19:47.321 --> 00:19:50.740
Hi! Mr. Harris,
good morning.

201
00:19:50.825 --> 00:19:51.950
Hi.

202
00:19:52.034 --> 00:19:54.452
Hello. We just got
a request from Tanabe Mori.

203
00:19:54.537 --> 00:19:56.037
He is the Johnny Carson
of Japan.

204
00:19:56.121 --> 00:19:58.998
It is a big honor to
be invited to his show.

205
00:19:59.083 --> 00:20:01.084
Can you stay here
until Friday?

206
00:20:02.378 --> 00:20:06.172
I'm surprised and honored, but I
think I need to check with my agent.

207
00:20:06.257 --> 00:20:07.215
Okay.

208
00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:08.550
I believe I may have
a previous commitment.

209
00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:10.343
Sure.
Okay. I understand.

210
00:20:10.427 --> 00:20:11.928
Shall we go?
Yes.

211
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.410
<i>I think
you should do it.</i>

212
00:20:35.494 --> 00:20:37.287
No, hear this, Fred.

213
00:20:37.371 --> 00:20:40.164
I gotta be on a plane
Thursday night.

214
00:20:40.249 --> 00:20:41.791
<i>We're looking
into it, Bob.</i>

215
00:20:41.876 --> 00:20:44.669
<i>They really want you to
stay and do that talk show.</i>

216
00:20:44.753 --> 00:20:47.171
<i>Apparently,
he's a really big deal...</i>

217
00:20:47.631 --> 00:20:50.049
Johnny Carson
of Japan. Yeah.

218
00:20:50.134 --> 00:20:53.553
<i>Bob, these people are paying you a
lot. Would you please consider it?</i>

219
00:20:53.637 --> 00:20:56.723
I already have.
I gotta get out of here.

220
00:20:56.807 --> 00:20:58.182
As soon as I can.

221
00:20:58.267 --> 00:21:00.018
<i>All right, you're
scheduled to leave Friday,</i>

222
00:21:00.102 --> 00:21:01.811
<i>but we'll hold it
for you Saturday.</i>

223
00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:03.062
All right, now...

224
00:21:03.147 --> 00:21:06.399
You're breaking up, Fred. There's
no reception in this studio.

225
00:21:06.483 --> 00:21:08.192
Forget it. Call me back.

226
00:21:16.327 --> 00:21:19.913
So, can you put your hand
close your face, please?

227
00:21:19.997 --> 00:21:21.372
I'm sorry, Naka.
What?

228
00:21:21.457 --> 00:21:25.710
Can you put your hand close
your face? Close your face.

229
00:21:28.839 --> 00:21:31.549
I don't get that close to the
glass until I'm on the floor.

230
00:21:31.634 --> 00:21:32.759
How's this?

231
00:21:33.928 --> 00:21:36.346
Yes. You want a whisky?

232
00:21:38.807 --> 00:21:42.393
This is not whisky. This is iced
tea. If you gave me real whisky...

233
00:21:42.478 --> 00:21:44.395
I need mysterious face.

234
00:21:44.521 --> 00:21:46.606
Can you show mysterious?
Mysterious.

235
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.400
I think I know what you want.
You want this, right?

236
00:21:49.485 --> 00:21:52.111
I need more mysterious and...

237
00:21:52.363 --> 00:21:53.446
More mysterious. Yeah.

238
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.491
I'll just try to think,
"Where the hell's the whisky?"

239
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.121
You are a movie star, yes?

240
00:22:02.206 --> 00:22:04.791
Yes, I should be doing
movies, yes, but...

241
00:22:04.875 --> 00:22:06.250
And Lat Pack.

242
00:22:06.502 --> 00:22:08.586
Lat Pack.
You know Lat Pack?

243
00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.089
- Rat... Rat Pack?
- Rat Pack. Yes, please.

244
00:22:11.173 --> 00:22:12.548
Oh, Rat Pack.

245
00:22:18.222 --> 00:22:20.181
I need more tension,
please.

246
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.351
More...

247
00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:28.564
You so gentleman, yes?

248
00:22:29.191 --> 00:22:30.900
<i>A Ring-a-Ding Ding!
Yeah.</i>

249
00:22:32.152 --> 00:22:34.153
Sinatora.
You know Sinatora?

250
00:22:35.656 --> 00:22:37.281
<i>Ol' Blue Eyes.
Yeah.</i>

251
00:22:38.701 --> 00:22:40.159
That's good. Yeah.

252
00:22:40.244 --> 00:22:41.786
That's more of Dino.
That's Dino.

253
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.204
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

254
00:22:43.914 --> 00:22:45.081
Great.

255
00:22:45.249 --> 00:22:46.207
Joey Bishop would you like?

256
00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:48.376
Yes. Just change film.

257
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.383
Are you drinking? No?

258
00:22:55.467 --> 00:22:56.426
Am I drinking?
Yeah.

259
00:22:56.552 --> 00:22:58.136
As soon as I'm done.

260
00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.971
Okay, close your hand, please. Huh?

261
00:23:00.055 --> 00:23:01.973
Close your hand. Yeah.
Close it?

262
00:23:02.057 --> 00:23:04.058
Yes. Close your
face, please.

263
00:23:04.143 --> 00:23:06.144
Close my...
Yes. Sorry.

264
00:23:07.438 --> 00:23:09.355
And 007?

265
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.357
He drinks martinis,
but okay, I got it.

266
00:23:11.442 --> 00:23:12.859
007, yeah.

267
00:23:12.943 --> 00:23:14.193
Loger Moore?

268
00:23:14.611 --> 00:23:16.362
Loger Moore?
Loger Moore.

269
00:23:16.447 --> 00:23:17.989
You know Loger Moore?

270
00:23:18.073 --> 00:23:19.198
Roger Moore?
Yeah.

271
00:23:19.283 --> 00:23:21.200
Okay. I...

272
00:23:21.285 --> 00:23:22.368
I always think of Sean
Connery. Seriously.

273
00:23:22.453 --> 00:23:23.536
No, no.

274
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.787
Didn't you get the Sean
Connery one over here?

275
00:23:24.872 --> 00:23:26.873
No. Loger Moore.
Okay.

276
00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:28.958
Yes.

277
00:23:29.501 --> 00:23:31.127
Loger Moore? No...

278
00:23:31.462 --> 00:23:33.337
Yeah. Okay.

279
00:23:33.839 --> 00:23:36.049
Yeah, okay. Good.

280
00:23:36.884 --> 00:23:38.718
More. Please.

281
00:23:38.802 --> 00:23:39.761
You mean "more,"
or Roger Moore again?

282
00:23:39.845 --> 00:23:41.679
Yeah. Yeah.

283
00:23:42.973 --> 00:23:44.307
Good.

284
00:23:44.558 --> 00:23:46.142
And sexy!

285
00:23:52.357 --> 00:23:56.360
Are you going

286
00:23:56.737 --> 00:24:01.032
<i>To Scarborough Fair?</i>

287
00:24:05.037 --> 00:24:07.872
<i>Parsley, sage</i>

288
00:24:07.956 --> 00:24:10.917
<i>Rosemary</i>

289
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:13.961
<i>And thyme</i>

290
00:24:14.046 --> 00:24:15.254
He's really sad.

291
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.930
Thank you.
We're glad to be here.

292
00:24:24.014 --> 00:24:25.848
We're Sausalito.

293
00:24:39.738 --> 00:24:41.280
They're beautiful.

294
00:24:41.365 --> 00:24:43.616
They're beautiful, yeah.
You know?

295
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.953
Send these over to
that table over there.

296
00:24:47.079 --> 00:24:48.704
- Old temple?
- An old temple?

297
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:49.956
Yeah.

298
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.207
Oh, beautiful, man.

299
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:54.544
Excuse me, sir.
From the woman over there.

300
00:24:54.628 --> 00:24:56.921
Oh! Oh, they are?
Really?

301
00:24:57.172 --> 00:24:58.548
Yeah, yeah.
What's... What's...

302
00:24:58.632 --> 00:25:02.093
Is Japan... Is it mainly
Buddhism here?

303
00:25:02.177 --> 00:25:04.178
Yeah, it's Buddhism.

304
00:25:04.888 --> 00:25:05.847
CD or...

305
00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:07.140
Yeah, CD.

306
00:25:07.224 --> 00:25:08.349
Playing her...

307
00:25:08.433 --> 00:25:10.143
Oh, she plays...
Guitar?

308
00:25:10.227 --> 00:25:12.103
Guitar. Guitar.

309
00:25:12.187 --> 00:25:13.896
That's a beautiful job.

310
00:25:47.764 --> 00:25:49.265
Help!

311
00:26:12.706 --> 00:26:14.373
Good morning.
Good morning.

312
00:26:14.458 --> 00:26:16.042
Good morning.
Good morning.

313
00:26:16.126 --> 00:26:18.127
Are you okay?
Yeah. Fine.

314
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:21.547
Car is outside.
Shall we go?

315
00:26:26.053 --> 00:26:27.803
That's what I told him.

316
00:26:28.096 --> 00:26:29.639
But if...
Yeah.

317
00:26:29.723 --> 00:26:31.474
He never listens.
Yeah.

318
00:26:34.645 --> 00:26:36.312
John?

319
00:26:36.688 --> 00:26:39.482
Oh, my God! John!
What are you doing here?

320
00:26:39.816 --> 00:26:43.569
Oh, well, you know, I'm
just here, shooting a band.

321
00:26:43.654 --> 00:26:44.654
What about you?

322
00:26:44.738 --> 00:26:45.947
I'm here promoting that
action movie I did.

323
00:26:47.115 --> 00:26:50.076
You know! I'm doing 20
million interviews a day.

324
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.744
It's crazy.

325
00:26:51.828 --> 00:26:53.037
God, it is so good
to see you!

326
00:26:53.121 --> 00:26:54.121
Yeah. Yeah.

327
00:26:54.206 --> 00:26:55.748
So, how long are you
gonna be here?

328
00:26:55.832 --> 00:26:57.875
We're here for a week.

329
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.418
I'm gonna go shoot
in Fukawaka.

330
00:27:00.587 --> 00:27:02.004
Oh, it's amazing!
Yeah.

331
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.923
It's amazing.
Oh, yeah.

332
00:27:07.219 --> 00:27:10.096
Oh, this is... This is
my wife, Charlotte.

333
00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.597
Hi! It's really nice
to meet you!

334
00:27:11.682 --> 00:27:12.848
Hi. Nice to meet you.

335
00:27:12.933 --> 00:27:14.350
Hello!
Yeah!

336
00:27:15.686 --> 00:27:17.645
Wife?
Yeah. Yeah.

337
00:27:18.522 --> 00:27:20.356
John. John.
Huh?

338
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.816
You are my favorite
photographer.

339
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.900
Oh, come on!

340
00:27:22.985 --> 00:27:24.860
No, you are. I only
want you to shoot me.

341
00:27:26.446 --> 00:27:28.364
It's true!

342
00:27:28.699 --> 00:27:32.118
I have the worst B.O.
right now. I'm so sorry.

343
00:27:32.202 --> 00:27:34.412
No, no, no.
But listen,

344
00:27:34.496 --> 00:27:35.454
let's all go out for
a drink sometime.

345
00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:36.580
Yeah.

346
00:27:36.665 --> 00:27:39.041
You know? Call me. Okay?

347
00:27:39.126 --> 00:27:40.126
Yeah. Okay.

348
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.211
Listen, I'm under
Evelyn Waugh.

349
00:27:42.713 --> 00:27:44.380
Oh, oh, oh.
Shh. Okay?

350
00:27:44.464 --> 00:27:45.965
Okay. Yeah.

351
00:27:46.049 --> 00:27:47.925
<i>Okay, arigatou, arigatou.</i>

352
00:27:51.388 --> 00:27:52.680
Evelyn Waugh?

353
00:27:52.806 --> 00:27:54.724
What?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.

354
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.892
Oh, come on. She's nice.

355
00:27:58.228 --> 00:28:01.314
What? You know... You know,
not everybody went to Yale.

356
00:28:02.566 --> 00:28:05.067
It was just a pseudonym,
for Christ's sake.

357
00:28:05.152 --> 00:28:06.986
Why do you have
to defend her?

358
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.072
Well, why do you have to point out
how stupid everybody is all the time?

359
00:28:10.157 --> 00:28:12.283
I thought it was funny.
Forget it.

360
00:28:13.118 --> 00:28:14.535
Well...

361
00:28:15.203 --> 00:28:16.662
Hey, John,
we gotta go.

362
00:28:16.747 --> 00:28:18.080
Oh. Yeah.

363
00:28:18.749 --> 00:28:20.082
Bye.

364
00:28:23.253 --> 00:28:26.088
<i>Did you ever wonder
what your purpose in life is?</i>

365
00:28:26.173 --> 00:28:29.675
<i>This book is about finding
your soul's purpose or destiny.</i>

366
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.804
<i>Every soul has its path, but
sometimes that path is not clear.</i>

367
00:28:34.473 --> 00:28:36.349
<i>The Inner Map Theory
is an example</i>

368
00:28:36.433 --> 00:28:38.434
<i>of how each soul
begins with an imprint,</i>

369
00:28:38.518 --> 00:28:41.979
<i>all compacted into a pattern that
has been selected by your soul</i>

370
00:28:42.064 --> 00:28:43.689
<i>before you've even
gotten here.</i>

371
00:28:48.653 --> 00:28:52.865
<i>You know, I guess the
reason why I like Japan the best</i>

372
00:28:52.949 --> 00:28:54.367
<i>out of all Asian countries,</i>

373
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:58.829
<i>is because I really feel
close to Buddhism.</i>

374
00:28:58.955 --> 00:29:00.122
<i>I really feel...</i>

375
00:29:01.917 --> 00:29:05.378
<i>That's part of what drew me
to Midnight Velocity as well,</i>

376
00:29:05.462 --> 00:29:08.381
<i>because although Keanu dies,</i>

377
00:29:08.465 --> 00:29:10.591
<i>he eventually gets
reincarnated.</i>

378
00:29:10.675 --> 00:29:14.220
<i>So there's hope. There's hope
in reincarnation, I think.</i>

379
00:29:14.554 --> 00:29:16.722
What was it like
working with Keanu Reeves?

380
00:29:16.807 --> 00:29:20.810
<i>He was always so... He was
always, you know, giving me ideas,</i>

381
00:29:20.894 --> 00:29:22.395
<i>and, you know, really helpful.</i>

382
00:29:22.479 --> 00:29:24.438
<i>He made me feel
really comfortable, so...</i>

383
00:29:24.523 --> 00:29:28.567
<i>And we both have two dogs,
and we both live in L.A.,</i>

384
00:29:28.652 --> 00:29:31.779
<i>so we have all these
different things in common.</i>

385
00:29:31.863 --> 00:29:34.698
<i>So, you know, we both
really like Mexican food,</i>

386
00:29:34.783 --> 00:29:37.701
<i>and yoga and</i>

387
00:29:37.786 --> 00:29:39.078
<i>karate!</i>

388
00:29:40.288 --> 00:29:42.998
<i>Mexican food. Yoga.</i>

389
00:30:01.101 --> 00:30:02.768
Hello. Hi.

390
00:30:06.857 --> 00:30:32.590
Okay.

391
00:31:45.413 --> 00:31:47.581
He got married
a couple of times

392
00:31:49.543 --> 00:31:50.668
to some nice women.

393
00:31:50.752 --> 00:31:53.879
Beautiful women, too. I mean, you
and I would be crazy for these women.

394
00:31:53.964 --> 00:31:56.131
But there were
always rumors.

395
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.759
I never liked his acting,

396
00:31:58.843 --> 00:32:01.762
so I never gave a damn
whether he was straight or not.

397
00:32:01.846 --> 00:32:04.056
Thank you. Hi. Thanks.

398
00:32:04.641 --> 00:32:06.183
What can I get you?

399
00:32:07.644 --> 00:32:08.936
I'm not sure.

400
00:32:11.856 --> 00:32:14.316
For relaxing times,

401
00:32:14.401 --> 00:32:16.402
make it Suntory time.

402
00:32:19.322 --> 00:32:20.614
I'll have a vodka tonic.

403
00:32:21.825 --> 00:32:23.158
Thanks.

404
00:32:28.582 --> 00:32:30.416
So, what are you
doing here?

405
00:32:32.043 --> 00:32:33.627
A couple of things.

406
00:32:34.004 --> 00:32:37.423
Taking a break from my wife,
forgetting my son's birthday

407
00:32:37.507 --> 00:32:40.175
and getting paid
$2 million

408
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.344
to endorse a whisky

409
00:32:42.846 --> 00:32:45.180
when I could be doing
a play somewhere.

410
00:32:46.933 --> 00:32:48.100
Oh.

411
00:32:49.436 --> 00:32:51.854
But the good news is,
the whisky works.

412
00:32:59.321 --> 00:33:00.821
What are you doing?

413
00:33:03.199 --> 00:33:04.533
My husband's
a photographer,

414
00:33:04.618 --> 00:33:06.952
so he's here working,

415
00:33:07.621 --> 00:33:09.622
and I wasn't doing anything,
so I came along.

416
00:33:09.706 --> 00:33:12.124
And we have some friends
that live here.

417
00:33:12.751 --> 00:33:13.959
How long have you
been married?

418
00:33:14.044 --> 00:33:15.294
Thank you.

419
00:33:17.172 --> 00:33:18.380
Two years.

420
00:33:19.257 --> 00:33:20.883
Twenty-five long ones.

421
00:33:22.677 --> 00:33:25.304
You're probably just
having a midlife crisis.

422
00:33:26.306 --> 00:33:28.057
Did you buy a Porsche yet?

423
00:33:29.934 --> 00:33:32.686
You know, I was thinking
about buying a Porsche.

424
00:33:36.358 --> 00:33:39.068
Twenty-five years.
That's a...

425
00:33:39.903 --> 00:33:41.528
Well, it's impressive.

426
00:33:44.491 --> 00:33:47.868
Well, you figure you sleep
one-third of your life.

427
00:33:48.161 --> 00:33:50.329
That knocks off eight years
of marriage right there.

428
00:33:50.413 --> 00:33:52.831
So you're down
to 16 and change.

429
00:33:52.916 --> 00:33:54.958
You're just a teenager
at marriage.

430
00:33:55.043 --> 00:33:58.712
You can drive it, but there's
still the occasional accident.

431
00:33:58.797 --> 00:33:59.922
Yeah.

432
00:34:01.508 --> 00:34:02.800
What do you do?

433
00:34:07.305 --> 00:34:09.223
I'm not sure yet,
actually.

434
00:34:09.307 --> 00:34:11.225
I just graduated
last spring.

435
00:34:12.102 --> 00:34:13.602
What did you study?

436
00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.187
Philosophy.

437
00:34:16.106 --> 00:34:17.940
Yeah, there's a good buck
in that racket.

438
00:34:18.024 --> 00:34:19.274
Yeah.

439
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.237
Well, so far
it's pro bono.

440
00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:26.949
Well, I'm sure you'll
figure out the angles.

441
00:34:27.033 --> 00:34:28.158
Yeah.

442
00:34:30.787 --> 00:34:33.038
I hope your Porsche works out.

443
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.249
Cheers to that, huh?

444
00:34:35.333 --> 00:34:36.542
Cheers to that.

445
00:34:48.513 --> 00:34:49.972
Wish I could sleep.

446
00:34:50.056 --> 00:34:51.306
Me, too.

447
00:35:00.817 --> 00:35:03.485
One, two, three,
and okay.

448
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.612
All right.

449
00:35:13.997 --> 00:35:17.332
One, two, three, four.

450
00:35:17.667 --> 00:35:21.211
And one, two, three, four.

451
00:35:21.296 --> 00:35:23.297
And one, two...

452
00:36:36.913 --> 00:36:39.081
<i>Wait!
Take me with you!</i>

453
00:36:58.768 --> 00:36:59.935
How'd it go, huh?

454
00:37:00.019 --> 00:37:02.688
Oh, it was good, you know.
I'm tired.

455
00:37:02.772 --> 00:37:05.899
Yeah, I gotta go downstairs
and meet Kelly for some drinks.

456
00:37:05.984 --> 00:37:08.026
She wants to talk about
some photo thing.

457
00:37:08.111 --> 00:37:10.237
Maybe I'll go
downstairs with you.

458
00:37:10.864 --> 00:37:12.531
Oh, you wanna come?

459
00:37:12.615 --> 00:37:13.907
Yeah, sure.

460
00:37:14.325 --> 00:37:16.702
Okay. Yeah.

461
00:37:18.955 --> 00:37:21.123
You

462
00:37:21.207 --> 00:37:24.960
<i>Stepped out of a dream</i>

463
00:37:25.253 --> 00:37:28.672
Everybody is always like,
"Kelly, you are anorexic."

464
00:37:28.756 --> 00:37:30.257
And I'm like,
"No, I'm not."

465
00:37:30.341 --> 00:37:33.093
I eat so much junk food,
you wouldn't believe it.

466
00:37:33.177 --> 00:37:34.845
Just because I have
a high metabolism.

467
00:37:34.929 --> 00:37:36.847
Because I thought
you were anorexic, too.

468
00:37:36.931 --> 00:37:38.348
Everybody does.
Everybody thinks that.

469
00:37:38.433 --> 00:37:40.392
Yeah, 'cause
you look so...

470
00:37:40.476 --> 00:37:42.561
Thank you.
I know, but it's...

471
00:37:42.645 --> 00:37:45.397
I mean, I eat whatever. I
have a really high metabolism.

472
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:47.065
Yeah.
But...

473
00:37:49.736 --> 00:37:51.862
My dad is an anorexic.

474
00:37:53.448 --> 00:37:55.407
- Really?
- Oh, really?

475
00:37:55.992 --> 00:37:57.034
Yeah.

476
00:37:57.118 --> 00:38:01.038
He fought on the American side
of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.

477
00:38:01.623 --> 00:38:02.998
He was taken prisoner,

478
00:38:03.082 --> 00:38:06.460
and the whole time he was there
they tortured him about food.

479
00:38:06.544 --> 00:38:09.463
Every day they told him
they put poison in the food.

480
00:38:09.547 --> 00:38:12.758
So they would always make
themselves throw up after every meal.

481
00:38:12.842 --> 00:38:15.510
That's horrible.
That's terrible.

482
00:38:16.846 --> 00:38:18.221
That's some crazy shit.

483
00:38:18.348 --> 00:38:19.598
You don't think he
sounds kind of goofy? No.

484
00:38:19.682 --> 00:38:21.725
You know that
break beat, right?

485
00:38:22.268 --> 00:38:24.061
Well, I been taking it
to some next level shit.

486
00:38:24.145 --> 00:38:26.438
Like, I'll take that and put
a delay on it, so it's like...

487
00:38:29.609 --> 00:38:31.902
So it's, like,
evolving the beat.

488
00:38:31.986 --> 00:38:35.864
So it, like, sounds hella large on
the track. You know what I'm saying?

489
00:38:36.532 --> 00:38:37.950
No.
No?

490
00:38:38.034 --> 00:38:39.868
You don't listen
to hip-hop?

491
00:38:40.203 --> 00:38:42.371
Oh, my God!
You guys gotta listen.

492
00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:45.499
I tried this power cleanse.
It's so amazing.

493
00:38:45.583 --> 00:38:46.917
Okay, promise me
you'll try it.

494
00:38:47.001 --> 00:38:48.377
Will you try
this power cleanse?

495
00:38:48.503 --> 00:38:50.337
I did it last week, and it's
amazing. I'll be right back.

496
00:38:50.421 --> 00:38:53.465
It's so good to get the
toxins out of your body.

497
00:38:53.549 --> 00:38:56.718
With all, like, the
pollution, all, like, the...

498
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:03.225
Hello.
Hello.

499
00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:05.060
You ever switch seats?

500
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:10.232
I like this one. If I fall,
someone will notice.

501
00:39:11.484 --> 00:39:12.693
Yeah.

502
00:39:13.277 --> 00:39:15.112
So, you having a nice time?

503
00:39:15.738 --> 00:39:17.364
Can you keep a secret?

504
00:39:17.907 --> 00:39:19.825
I'm trying to organize
a prison break.

505
00:39:19.909 --> 00:39:21.868
I'm looking for, like,
an accomplice.

506
00:39:23.287 --> 00:39:26.581
We'd have to, first,
get out of this bar.

507
00:39:26.666 --> 00:39:30.335
Then the hotel, then the
city and then the country.

508
00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.254
Are you in,
or are you out?

509
00:39:32.338 --> 00:39:33.338
I'm in.

510
00:39:33.423 --> 00:39:35.340
Good.
I'll go pack my stuff.

511
00:39:35.425 --> 00:39:36.466
Get your coat.

512
00:39:36.551 --> 00:39:37.718
See you.

513
00:39:38.302 --> 00:39:41.138
I hope you've had enough to
drink. It's gonna take courage.

514
00:39:47.979 --> 00:39:51.356
Oh, look.
The label got me these.

515
00:39:51.774 --> 00:39:54.317
I love Cristal.
You wanna have some?

516
00:39:54.986 --> 00:39:58.739
Well, I'm... I gotta go.
I mean, I...

517
00:40:01.617 --> 00:40:04.119
You know,
you don't have to stay.

518
00:40:04.203 --> 00:40:05.245
I mean...

519
00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:06.496
You don't have to go,
do you?

520
00:40:07.749 --> 00:40:09.541
Well, I...

521
00:40:09.625 --> 00:40:11.376
I know. You're gonna be
working the whole time.

522
00:40:11.461 --> 00:40:12.836
I'll have a much
better time here.

523
00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.920
I'll call Charlie
and those guys.

524
00:40:14.005 --> 00:40:15.964
Yeah! Call those guys.

525
00:40:16.758 --> 00:40:19.217
And I'm gonna be back
on Sunday, and I...

526
00:40:20.136 --> 00:40:21.803
I love you, you know.

527
00:40:25.058 --> 00:40:26.892
Okay?
I love you.

528
00:40:31.147 --> 00:40:32.397
I'll see you. Okay?

529
00:40:32.482 --> 00:40:34.816
Yeah, it's just gonna be a
couple of... A couple of days.

530
00:40:34.901 --> 00:40:35.942
Bye.

531
00:40:36.027 --> 00:40:37.235
I love you.

532
00:41:42.468 --> 00:41:43.760
Hello.

533
00:41:43.845 --> 00:41:45.053
Hello.
How are you?

534
00:41:45.138 --> 00:41:46.555
Good. How are you?

535
00:41:51.894 --> 00:41:53.061
It's a cool pool,
isn't it?

536
00:41:53.146 --> 00:41:54.563
Yeah, it's nice.

537
00:41:56.732 --> 00:41:58.358
Get any sleep?

538
00:41:58.442 --> 00:42:00.610
Not yet. How about you?

539
00:42:01.154 --> 00:42:03.071
No. Not yet.

540
00:42:04.365 --> 00:42:06.074
How long you staying for?

541
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.493
I'll be in the bar for
the rest of the week.

542
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.289
Well, that's good.

543
00:42:13.749 --> 00:42:17.043
I'm going out with some friends
later, if you wanna come...

544
00:42:18.087 --> 00:42:19.129
Sure.

545
00:42:19.213 --> 00:42:21.006
Okay. I'll see you later.

546
00:42:21.757 --> 00:42:23.216
Okay.
See you.

547
00:42:54.624 --> 00:42:55.999
Which one is burgundy?

548
00:42:58.127 --> 00:42:59.211
Hold on!

549
00:43:00.463 --> 00:43:01.671
Hold on.

550
00:43:05.885 --> 00:43:08.553
You really are having
a midlife crisis, huh?

551
00:43:08.638 --> 00:43:10.931
Really? Yeah,
I was afraid of that.

552
00:43:11.641 --> 00:43:16.019
I kept telling myself that I just wanted
to be ready in case we go to war tonight.

553
00:43:19.815 --> 00:43:21.942
My bathroom is
messier than yours.

554
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.241
And it's not like
you're not trying.

555
00:43:29.325 --> 00:43:31.076
Here, will you cut
the tag out for me?

556
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.285
Sure.

557
00:43:34.747 --> 00:43:36.122
You're too tall.

558
00:43:38.918 --> 00:43:40.919
Anybody ever tell you,
you may be too small?

559
00:43:42.129 --> 00:43:43.088
Whose is this?

560
00:43:43.172 --> 00:43:46.091
<i>"A Soul's Search:
Finding Your True Calling."</i>

561
00:43:46.175 --> 00:43:47.425
I don't know.

562
00:43:48.678 --> 00:43:49.636
I have that.

563
00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.596
Did it work out
for you, then?

564
00:43:53.474 --> 00:43:54.808
Obviously.

565
00:43:56.227 --> 00:43:59.145
Okay.

566
00:44:00.856 --> 00:44:02.148
Where's your shoes?

567
00:44:02.233 --> 00:44:03.275
They're over here.

568
00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:04.484
Where's your room key?

569
00:44:04.568 --> 00:44:05.694
It's in my bag.

570
00:44:06.279 --> 00:44:07.320
And where's your bag?

571
00:44:07.405 --> 00:44:08.655
It's right here.

572
00:44:09.156 --> 00:44:10.282
Let's go.
Wait!

573
00:44:10.366 --> 00:44:11.408
There's the elevator.
I gotta go.

574
00:44:11.492 --> 00:44:12.575
Hey!

575
00:44:16.038 --> 00:44:17.539
Hi! How are you?

576
00:44:17.623 --> 00:44:19.165
Hi, Charlie!

577
00:44:21.544 --> 00:44:23.670
Bob, this is
Charlie Brown.

578
00:44:23.754 --> 00:44:24.963
Hi. Nice to meet you.
How are you?

579
00:44:25.047 --> 00:44:26.548
Nice to meet you.

580
00:44:26.632 --> 00:44:28.174
This is Bambie.
How are you, Bambie?

581
00:44:28.259 --> 00:44:29.384
His real name's
Hayashi, but...

582
00:44:29.468 --> 00:44:30.969
Why do they call you
Charlie Brown?

583
00:44:31.053 --> 00:44:33.805
Everybody say, "He looks
like Charlie Brown."

584
00:44:33.889 --> 00:44:35.265
You know, Snoopy, man.

585
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:37.600
Oh, I'll be right back.

586
00:44:38.144 --> 00:44:42.063
Bob, over here. These are
my friends. Very beautiful.

587
00:44:42.148 --> 00:44:45.942
She's "B," and she's Rico,
and she's Mayumi.

588
00:44:46.027 --> 00:44:47.319
Mayumi. How are you?
I'm Bob.

589
00:44:47.403 --> 00:44:48.403
Oh! Bob.

590
00:44:48.487 --> 00:44:50.739
Bob from United States,
man.

591
00:44:52.033 --> 00:44:53.450
Hi, Bob.

592
00:44:53.534 --> 00:44:55.160
Maybe you'd like to
sing backup for me.

593
00:44:55.244 --> 00:44:56.619
This is my
surfing teacher.

594
00:44:56.704 --> 00:44:57.829
He's your
surfing teacher?

595
00:44:57.913 --> 00:44:59.789
Sometime, sometime.

596
00:44:59.874 --> 00:45:00.915
You're a surfer?

597
00:45:37.703 --> 00:45:39.496
The emperor's house? Cool.

598
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.626
Yeah?
Yeah.

599
00:45:48.422 --> 00:45:50.090
Cool!

600
00:45:50.174 --> 00:45:51.216
Right.

601
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.718
You don't have anything...
Do you have anything...

602
00:45:53.803 --> 00:45:54.803
Hey.

603
00:45:54.887 --> 00:45:55.887
Hey. How you doing?

604
00:45:55.971 --> 00:45:56.971
Good. How are you?

605
00:45:57.056 --> 00:45:58.181
My Japanese is getting better.

606
00:45:58.265 --> 00:46:00.058
We started speaking English.

607
00:46:06.482 --> 00:46:07.816
Charlie.

608
00:46:14.073 --> 00:46:15.907
Get out, guys!

609
00:46:15.991 --> 00:46:17.992
- BBs!
- They sting!

610
00:46:25.543 --> 00:46:27.085
Who are these guys,
anyway?

611
00:46:33.759 --> 00:46:35.385
Hey, hey, hey!

612
00:46:37.388 --> 00:46:38.513
Oh, no.

613
00:47:01.245 --> 00:47:02.370
Hi.

614
00:47:03.664 --> 00:47:05.081
Come on!

615
00:47:05.541 --> 00:47:07.500
Hey, guys! Over here!

616
00:47:07.585 --> 00:47:09.377
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hurry up!

617
00:47:09.462 --> 00:47:10.545
Wait!
Our tour guide!

618
00:47:10.629 --> 00:47:11.838
Hurry up!

619
00:47:21.223 --> 00:47:22.307
Yeah?
Gorgeous.

620
00:47:22.391 --> 00:47:23.475
Gorgeous?

621
00:47:23.559 --> 00:47:24.601
Blonde and black.

622
00:47:30.608 --> 00:47:32.108
Cheese. Cheese-o!

623
00:47:32.193 --> 00:47:33.359
Cheese!

624
00:47:35.196 --> 00:47:37.113
Yeah, yeah.
Hi.

625
00:47:38.073 --> 00:47:40.450
Hi, I'm Hans.
Nice to meet you.

626
00:47:40.534 --> 00:47:42.577
I'm Charlotte.
Nice to meet you.

627
00:47:43.204 --> 00:47:44.621
Hi.
Hi.

628
00:47:48.667 --> 00:47:50.919
Last weekend,
I went surfing.

629
00:47:51.003 --> 00:47:52.003
Right.

630
00:47:52.087 --> 00:47:55.673
About seven people, you know.
Some friends.

631
00:47:55.758 --> 00:47:59.511
And we camp over
there on the beach.

632
00:48:01.013 --> 00:48:04.015
In fact, we made a kind of...

633
00:48:04.099 --> 00:48:06.017
Wait. What kind
of weed is it?

634
00:48:06.101 --> 00:48:07.519
I don't know.

635
00:48:07.603 --> 00:48:11.648
<i>Baby when I saw you turnin'
at the end of the street</i>

636
00:48:13.943 --> 00:48:15.527
<i>I knew our time was gone</i>

637
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:19.113
<i>Into blank pages</i>

638
00:48:19.198 --> 00:48:24.244
<i>Just understand I was afraid
to be a simple guy</i>

639
00:48:24.328 --> 00:48:26.913
<i>I tried my best to smile</i>

640
00:48:26.997 --> 00:48:29.582
<i>But deep inside my heart</i>

641
00:48:29.667 --> 00:48:32.710
<i>l felt like the shell
that a crab comes in</i>

642
00:48:33.212 --> 00:48:35.755
<i>I guess I couldn't
live without things</i>

643
00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:37.549
God sabe the queen

644
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:41.052
<i>A fascist regime</i>

645
00:48:41.971 --> 00:48:44.847
<i>It made you a moron</i>

646
00:48:44.974 --> 00:48:46.933
<i>A potential H-bomb</i>

647
00:48:48.644 --> 00:48:50.144
<i>God save the queen</i>

648
00:48:51.605 --> 00:48:53.773
<i>She ain't no human being</i>

649
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:57.235
<i>There's no future</i>

650
00:48:57.903 --> 00:49:01.114
<i>In England's dreaming</i>

651
00:49:04.034 --> 00:49:07.328
As I walk through

652
00:49:07.496 --> 00:49:10.206
<i>This wicked world</i>

653
00:49:11.166 --> 00:49:13.626
<i>Searchin' for light
in the darkness</i>

654
00:49:14.878 --> 00:49:17.505
<i>Of insanity</i>

655
00:49:17.756 --> 00:49:19.841
<i>I ask myself</i>

656
00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:23.845
<i>Is all hope lost?</i>

657
00:49:24.513 --> 00:49:27.140
<i>Is there only pain</i>

658
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:28.558
<i>And hatred</i>

659
00:49:28.642 --> 00:49:30.518
<i>And misery?</i>

660
00:49:31.979 --> 00:49:35.648
<i>And each time
I feel like this inside</i>

661
00:49:35.733 --> 00:49:39.319
<i>There's one thing
I want to know</i>

662
00:49:39.737 --> 00:49:44.616
<i>What's so funny 'bout peace
love and understanding?</i>

663
00:49:44.825 --> 00:49:46.367
<i>Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh</i>

664
00:49:46.452 --> 00:49:52.832
<i>What's so funny 'bout peace
love and understanding?</i>

665
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:56.961
I'm winkin' at ya

666
00:49:57.046 --> 00:50:01.382
<i>Gonna make you, make you
make you notice</i>

667
00:50:02.593 --> 00:50:04.552
<i>Gonna use my arms</i>

668
00:50:05.054 --> 00:50:06.971
<i>Gonna use my legs</i>

669
00:50:07.348 --> 00:50:09.390
<i>Gonna use my style</i>

670
00:50:10.059 --> 00:50:12.393
<i>Gonna use my sidestep</i>

671
00:50:12.561 --> 00:50:14.854
<i>Gonna use my fingers</i>

672
00:50:15.064 --> 00:50:17.982
<i>Gonna use my, my,
my, my, my, my</i>

673
00:50:18.067 --> 00:50:20.610
<i>Imagination, oh-ohh</i>

674
00:50:20.694 --> 00:50:22.445
<i>'Cause I'm</i>

675
00:50:22.529 --> 00:50:24.697
<i>Gonna make you see</i>

676
00:50:24.823 --> 00:50:28.993
<i>Nobody else here,
no one like me</i>

677
00:50:30.245 --> 00:50:31.496
<i>I'm special</i>

678
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.622
<i>Special</i>

679
00:50:32.706 --> 00:50:34.123
<i>So special</i>

680
00:50:34.208 --> 00:50:35.208
<i>Special</i>

681
00:50:35.292 --> 00:50:37.877
<i>I gotta have some of your</i>

682
00:50:37.961 --> 00:50:40.838
<i>Attention, give it to me</i>

683
00:50:40.923 --> 00:50:43.633
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Bob Harris.</i>

684
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.011
<i>Thanks. This is hard.</i>

685
00:50:47.346 --> 00:50:49.347
Oh, Jesus.

686
00:50:55.312 --> 00:50:59.482
<i>I could feel at the time</i>

687
00:50:59.566 --> 00:51:03.069
<i>There was no way of knowing</i>

688
00:51:03.153 --> 00:51:06.698
<i>Fallen leaves in the night</i>

689
00:51:07.032 --> 00:51:10.993
<i>Who can say
where they're blowin'?</i>

690
00:51:11.078 --> 00:51:13.955
<i>As free as the wind</i>

691
00:51:15.582 --> 00:51:18.042
<i>Hopefully learnin'</i>

692
00:51:18.127 --> 00:51:21.587
<i>Why the sea on the tide</i>

693
00:51:22.297 --> 00:51:25.717
<i>Has no way of turnin'</i>

694
00:51:29.138 --> 00:51:31.556
<i>More than this</i>

695
00:51:32.558 --> 00:51:36.394
<i>You know there's nothing</i>

696
00:51:36.478 --> 00:51:39.814
<i>More than this</i>

697
00:51:40.315 --> 00:51:43.776
<i>Tell me one thing</i>

698
00:51:43.986 --> 00:51:47.155
<i>More than this</i>

699
00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:52.493
<i>Ooh, there's nothing</i>

700
00:52:48.842 --> 00:52:51.719
<i>Close my eyes</i>

701
00:52:52.554 --> 00:52:54.764
<i>Feel me now</i>

702
00:52:56.225 --> 00:52:58.059
<i>l don't know</i>

703
00:52:58.477 --> 00:53:02.522
<i>How you could not love me now</i>

704
00:53:03.607 --> 00:53:05.775
<i>You will know</i>

705
00:53:05.901 --> 00:53:09.904
<i>With her feet down
to the ground</i>

706
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.074
<i>Over there</i>

707
00:53:13.617 --> 00:53:17.245
<i>And I want you love to know</i>

708
00:53:18.747 --> 00:53:21.374
<i>You can't hide</i>

709
00:53:21.959 --> 00:53:24.335
<i>Oh, no</i>

710
00:53:24.419 --> 00:53:27.171
<i>From the way I feel</i>

711
00:55:32.464 --> 00:55:33.714
<i>Hello?</i>

712
00:55:33.799 --> 00:55:34.882
Hey.

713
00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:37.051
<i>Hello, Bob.</i>

714
00:55:38.095 --> 00:55:40.554
Hey, you know,
those carpet samples,

715
00:55:40.639 --> 00:55:42.181
you were right
about the burgundy.

716
00:55:42.265 --> 00:55:43.975
It wasn't even close.

717
00:55:44.059 --> 00:55:45.559
Blows the others away.

718
00:55:45.644 --> 00:55:47.812
<i>I'm glad you like it.</i>

719
00:55:49.231 --> 00:55:53.442
I saw a great house tonight
that you would've loved,

720
00:55:53.902 --> 00:55:56.278
and that burgundy would've
been good in this house, really.

721
00:55:56.363 --> 00:55:57.488
<i>Really?</i>

722
00:55:57.572 --> 00:56:00.074
A guy designed his
own house and built it.

723
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:02.618
<i>Oh, yeah? I wish I'd seen it.</i>

724
00:56:04.579 --> 00:56:07.915
He's a fashion guy. All these
fashion people were there.

725
00:56:08.792 --> 00:56:11.877
And there were
Japanese surfers there,

726
00:56:11.962 --> 00:56:16.716
and the guy was playing really,
really, really great music.

727
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.176
I should've found out what
it was and brought some...

728
00:56:19.261 --> 00:56:21.679
I'll bring some back.
I'll try to find out.

729
00:56:21.763 --> 00:56:24.015
<i>That sounds great.
Can you hold on?</i>

730
00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:30.271
<i>You have to have something for
breakfast. Do you want some cereal?</i>

731
00:56:30.355 --> 00:56:32.189
Tell her I said
she's gotta eat something.

732
00:56:32.274 --> 00:56:34.567
<i>I'm just trying to get her
to eat something.</i>

733
00:56:34.651 --> 00:56:37.194
Yeah. Tell her I said
she has to eat something.

734
00:56:37.279 --> 00:56:39.113
<i>Your dad says
eat something.</i>

735
00:56:39.197 --> 00:56:40.197
<i>No.</i>

736
00:56:40.282 --> 00:56:42.450
Eat. Tell her I said so.

737
00:56:42.534 --> 00:56:44.785
<i>She won't eat anything.
Forget it.</i>

738
00:56:45.287 --> 00:56:47.371
<i>Look, I'm glad
you're having fun.</i>

739
00:56:48.457 --> 00:56:51.876
It's not fun. It's just...
It's just very, very different.

740
00:56:52.419 --> 00:56:54.003
<i>Maybe that's good.</i>

741
00:56:55.297 --> 00:56:57.840
<i>I have to get the kids off
for school, okay?</i>

742
00:56:57.924 --> 00:56:59.842
<i>So, can I call you in a while?</i>

743
00:57:01.178 --> 00:57:04.263
I might not be up.
It's... It's, like, 4:00.

744
00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:08.642
<i>Well, you better get some sleep.
You have work in the morning.</i>

745
00:57:08.727 --> 00:57:11.145
No, actually,
they gave me tomorrow off.

746
00:57:11.855 --> 00:57:13.689
<i>That must be nice.</i>

747
00:57:16.777 --> 00:57:19.653
<i>All right. Well, thanks
for checking in. I gotta go.</i>

748
00:57:20.072 --> 00:57:21.447
All right. Have a great,
great night.

749
00:57:21.531 --> 00:57:22.573
<i>All right.</i>

750
00:57:22.657 --> 00:57:25.159
I mean, I guess have
a great morning, huh?

751
00:57:25.827 --> 00:57:27.328
<i>Good night, Bob. Good night.</i>

752
00:57:27.412 --> 00:57:28.496
Good night.

753
00:57:30.665 --> 00:57:31.874
I love you.

754
00:57:34.544 --> 00:57:36.253
That was a stupid idea.

755
00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:50.161
I was feeling tight, you know? Mmm-hmm.

756
00:58:50.245 --> 00:58:52.079
Shoulders and neck.
Mmm-hmm.

757
00:58:52.247 --> 00:58:54.832
So I called down
and had a

758
00:58:56.084 --> 00:58:57.501
shiatsu massage
in my room.

759
00:58:57.586 --> 00:58:58.794
That's nice.

760
00:58:58.879 --> 00:59:02.089
And the tightness has
completely disappeared

761
00:59:02.507 --> 00:59:04.341
and been replaced by

762
00:59:05.552 --> 00:59:07.178
unbelievable pain.

763
00:59:08.054 --> 00:59:10.222
Just staggering,
unbearable pain.

764
00:59:10.307 --> 00:59:11.557
That's too bad.

765
00:59:11.641 --> 00:59:13.100
Yeah.
I'm in pain.

766
00:59:13.185 --> 00:59:17.980
I got my foot banged
up, and... Wanna see it?

767
00:59:19.024 --> 00:59:20.649
How do you say no?

768
00:59:20.734 --> 00:59:21.859
Oh, my gosh!

769
00:59:21.943 --> 00:59:22.943
I know.

770
00:59:23.028 --> 00:59:24.028
That's...

771
00:59:24.279 --> 00:59:25.529
How...
When did you do this?

772
00:59:25.614 --> 00:59:27.948
I did it the other day.
It hurts, you know?

773
00:59:28.033 --> 00:59:29.825
Didn't you feel
any pain? Your...

774
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:31.535
Yeah, it really hurt.
It was...

775
00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.454
Yeah. That toe
is almost dead.

776
00:59:34.664 --> 00:59:36.040
I think I gotta take you
to a doctor.

777
00:59:36.124 --> 00:59:38.250
You can't just put that
back in the shoe.

778
00:59:38.335 --> 00:59:40.044
No. I don't think so.

779
00:59:40.128 --> 00:59:42.630
Well, you either go to a
doctor, or you leave it here.

780
00:59:45.217 --> 00:59:47.301
He's smiling.
You like that idea?

781
00:59:47.636 --> 00:59:50.095
See, they love black toe
over in this country.

782
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.097
You got a sharp knife?

783
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:54.183
Gotta be, you know,
in this country,

784
00:59:54.267 --> 00:59:55.976
somebody's gotta
prefer a black toe.

785
00:59:57.354 --> 00:59:58.646
"Brack toe."

786
00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:01.982
Or we should probably hang
around until someone orders it.

787
01:00:02.567 --> 01:00:04.068
Hey, what's with
the straight face?

788
01:00:04.653 --> 01:00:06.237
Hospital regulations.
Get in there.

789
01:00:06.321 --> 01:00:07.321
All right.
Thank you.

790
01:00:07.405 --> 01:00:08.405
All right.

791
01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:14.203
Careful, okay?
No, don't!

792
01:00:14.746 --> 01:00:16.789
No!
Hey, use the horn, fella.

793
01:00:22.754 --> 01:00:24.546
Let's try "mixed internal."

794
01:00:24.839 --> 01:00:26.215
Yeah. Go.

795
01:00:26.299 --> 01:00:27.299
Switched to beer, huh?

796
01:00:27.842 --> 01:00:29.593
Go. Go. You might
want to switch to sake.

797
01:00:29.678 --> 01:00:30.928
Stop.

798
01:00:34.015 --> 01:00:35.057
Hi.

799
01:00:35.684 --> 01:00:36.767
Hi.
Hi.

800
01:00:37.978 --> 01:00:40.271
Yeah. We need a doctor.

801
01:00:40.355 --> 01:00:42.564
For a hurt... Emergency room.

802
01:00:42.649 --> 01:00:45.442
It's not an emergency.
I just hurt my foot.

803
01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:55.452
Okay, do we fill this out?
We go over there?

804
01:00:55.537 --> 01:00:56.912
Which number?

805
01:01:03.378 --> 01:01:06.130
We're not going to another hospital,
so whatever you say is okay.

806
01:01:06.214 --> 01:01:07.381
Okay.

807
01:01:08.258 --> 01:01:10.509
Could you put that back
in the garage for us?

808
01:01:45.086 --> 01:01:46.420
"In desuka"?

809
01:01:57.098 --> 01:02:00.309
Japan.

810
01:02:03.229 --> 01:02:04.229
Japan...

811
01:02:04.856 --> 01:02:05.856
After?

812
01:02:06.941 --> 01:02:07.941
Japan...

813
01:02:18.203 --> 01:02:22.122
Ahh-ah, so. Ahh-ah.

814
01:02:23.124 --> 01:02:32.216
Ahh, so. Ahh...

815
01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.010
How's that song go?

816
01:02:47.816 --> 01:02:49.191
Is that for me?

817
01:02:50.443 --> 01:02:51.819
Yeah, it can be for you.

818
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.271
<i>Hey, Bob, it's Charlotte.</i>

819
01:03:27.355 --> 01:03:31.692
<i>I'm going to meet Charlie and those guys
at this place called Orange around 10:00,</i>

820
01:03:31.776 --> 01:03:34.528
<i>so I'll fax you a map
on how to get there.</i>

821
01:03:34.612 --> 01:03:37.030
<i>I hope you can come
and meet us. Bye.</i>

822
01:03:46.124 --> 01:03:48.709
<i>Suckin' on my titties
like you wanted me</i>

823
01:03:48.793 --> 01:03:50.586
<i>Callin' me all the time
like Blondie</i>

824
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:54.214
<i>Check out my Chrissie be-Hynde
It's fine all of the time</i>

825
01:03:54.299 --> 01:03:56.049
<i>Like sex on the beach is</i>

826
01:03:56.134 --> 01:03:58.927
<i>What else is in the
Teaches of Peaches?</i>

827
01:03:59.012 --> 01:04:00.888
<i>Huh, what?</i>

828
01:04:08.229 --> 01:04:10.647
<i>Suckin' on my titties
like you wanted me</i>

829
01:04:10.732 --> 01:04:13.358
<i>Callin' me all the time
like Blondie</i>

830
01:04:13.443 --> 01:04:15.903
How long have
you been here?

831
01:04:15.987 --> 01:04:17.237
I couldn't say.

832
01:04:17.739 --> 01:04:19.740
Where's Charlie
and those guys?

833
01:04:21.576 --> 01:04:23.494
They're taking
a dance class.

834
01:04:24.496 --> 01:04:28.040
<i>Why, what?</i>

835
01:04:28.208 --> 01:04:31.668
<i>Uh-huh</i>

836
01:04:31.878 --> 01:04:35.422
<i>What? Right</i>

837
01:04:35.548 --> 01:04:37.466
<i>Oh</i>

838
01:04:41.721 --> 01:04:42.763
Can I get you
a couple drinks?

839
01:04:42.847 --> 01:04:43.931
Let's go.

840
01:04:44.015 --> 01:04:45.349
Okay.
Okay.

841
01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:46.892
<i>Like you wanted me</i>

842
01:04:46.976 --> 01:04:48.101
Thank you.

843
01:04:48.228 --> 01:04:49.561
<i>Callin' me all the time
like Blondie</i>

844
01:04:52.774 --> 01:04:54.149
He's got blockers.

845
01:04:55.610 --> 01:04:57.319
They've got room to run.

846
01:04:57.612 --> 01:05:00.030
He's cutting back.
He cut back.

847
01:05:00.114 --> 01:05:02.574
He's dancing. He's dancing.
Where'd he go?

848
01:05:05.828 --> 01:05:07.079
There you are.

849
01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:11.500
Say "Hi."

850
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:17.589
Hi. You ready?

851
01:05:18.758 --> 01:05:19.967
Come on.

852
01:05:22.637 --> 01:05:24.471
<i>Thank you, Tokyo!</i>

853
01:05:24.556 --> 01:05:29.393
<i>Nobody does it better</i>

854
01:05:31.521 --> 01:05:36.275
<i>Makes me feel sad
for the rest</i>

855
01:05:38.778 --> 01:05:41.905
<i>Nobody does it</i>

856
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:44.616
<i>Half as good as you</i>

857
01:05:45.994 --> 01:05:49.621
<i>Baby, you're the best</i>

858
01:05:49.706 --> 01:05:51.832
You two. Both of you.

859
01:05:53.876 --> 01:05:56.295
<i>l wasn't lookin'</i>

860
01:05:57.171 --> 01:06:00.048
<i>But somehow you found me</i>

861
01:06:02.176 --> 01:06:06.263
<i>l tried to hide
from your love, yeah</i>

862
01:07:38.773 --> 01:07:40.107
<i>No, no. Not here.</i>

863
01:07:40.775 --> 01:07:42.234
<i>It must be over there.</i>

864
01:07:58.167 --> 01:07:59.543
You know,
the first time I saw you,

865
01:07:59.627 --> 01:08:02.129
you were wearing
a tuxedo at the bar.

866
01:08:02.338 --> 01:08:03.964
You were very dashing.

867
01:08:04.465 --> 01:08:05.966
I liked the mascara.

868
01:08:12.473 --> 01:08:15.058
But the first time I saw you
was in the elevator.

869
01:08:15.143 --> 01:08:16.226
Really?

870
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:17.394
You don't remember?

871
01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:23.191
I guess you do
kind of blend in, huh?

872
01:08:25.570 --> 01:08:27.112
Did I scowl at you?

873
01:08:28.072 --> 01:08:29.573
No, you smiled.

874
01:08:29.657 --> 01:08:30.699
I did?

875
01:08:30.783 --> 01:08:32.409
Yes, it was a complete
accident.

876
01:08:32.493 --> 01:08:34.077
A freak.
I haven't seen it since.

877
01:08:34.162 --> 01:08:36.955
Just that one time.
Like that, but bigger.

878
01:08:38.624 --> 01:08:41.209
Bigger. Yeah, big, big...

879
01:08:41.502 --> 01:08:43.211
Well, not that big.

880
01:08:44.338 --> 01:08:46.089
<i>My goodness.</i>

881
01:08:52.847 --> 01:08:56.516
<i>Marcello, come here.
Hurry up.</i>

882
01:09:00.354 --> 01:09:03.023
Why do they switch
the "R's" and the "L's" here?

883
01:09:04.150 --> 01:09:06.651
Oh, for yuks.
You know, just to mix it up.

884
01:09:08.196 --> 01:09:11.072
They have to amuse themselves,
'cause we're not making them laugh.

885
01:09:14.702 --> 01:09:18.830
Let's never come here again, 'cause
it would never be as much fun.

886
01:09:21.876 --> 01:09:24.127
Whatever you say.
You're the boss.

887
01:09:29.467 --> 01:09:30.717
I'm stuck.

888
01:09:34.555 --> 01:09:36.014
Does it get easier?

889
01:09:36.724 --> 01:09:37.766
No.

890
01:09:39.894 --> 01:09:41.144
Yes.

891
01:09:42.230 --> 01:09:43.522
It gets easier.

892
01:09:44.607 --> 01:09:45.857
Oh, yeah?

893
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.651
Look at you.

894
01:09:49.445 --> 01:09:50.737
Thanks.

895
01:09:52.907 --> 01:09:55.075
The more you know
who you are,

896
01:09:55.159 --> 01:09:56.743
and what you want,

897
01:09:57.411 --> 01:09:59.538
the less you let

898
01:10:00.331 --> 01:10:01.706
things upset you.

899
01:10:03.501 --> 01:10:04.751
Yeah.

900
01:10:06.546 --> 01:10:09.005
I just don't know
what I'm supposed to be.

901
01:10:09.882 --> 01:10:11.174
You know?

902
01:10:12.009 --> 01:10:14.261
I tried being a writer,
but...

903
01:10:14.762 --> 01:10:16.179
I hate what I write.

904
01:10:16.264 --> 01:10:20.100
And I tried
taking pictures,

905
01:10:21.519 --> 01:10:23.478
but they're so mediocre,
you know.

906
01:10:23.563 --> 01:10:26.690
Every girl goes through
a photography phase.

907
01:10:27.441 --> 01:10:29.025
You know, like horses?

908
01:10:30.027 --> 01:10:34.281
You know? Take dumb
pictures of your feet.

909
01:10:36.659 --> 01:10:38.285
You'll figure that out.

910
01:10:39.871 --> 01:10:41.621
I'm not worried
about you.

911
01:10:45.167 --> 01:10:46.418
Keep writing.

912
01:10:51.799 --> 01:10:53.425
But I'm so mean.

913
01:10:55.428 --> 01:10:57.262
Mean's okay.
Yeah?

914
01:11:04.437 --> 01:11:06.897
What about marriage?
Does that get easier?

915
01:11:14.113 --> 01:11:15.363
That's hard.

916
01:11:21.329 --> 01:11:23.204
We used to have
a lot of fun.

917
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:28.001
Lydia would come with me
when I made the movies,

918
01:11:28.085 --> 01:11:30.754
and we would laugh
about it all.

919
01:11:32.965 --> 01:11:36.509
Now she doesn't want to leave
the kids, and she doesn't

920
01:11:38.554 --> 01:11:41.681
need me to be there.

921
01:11:41.766 --> 01:11:44.976
The kids miss me,
but they're fine.

922
01:11:47.647 --> 01:11:51.483
It gets a whole lot more
complicated when you have kids.

923
01:11:51.901 --> 01:11:53.693
Yeah. It's scary.

924
01:11:57.365 --> 01:11:59.115
It's the most terrifying
day of your life

925
01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.326
the day the first one is born.

926
01:12:01.953 --> 01:12:04.496
Yeah. Nobody ever
tells you that.

927
01:12:05.957 --> 01:12:07.415
Your life,

928
01:12:08.292 --> 01:12:09.584
as you know it,

929
01:12:10.044 --> 01:12:11.378
is gone.

930
01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.214
Never to return.

931
01:12:16.884 --> 01:12:20.303
But they learn how to walk, and
they learn how to talk, and...

932
01:12:21.222 --> 01:12:24.182
And you want to be with them.

933
01:12:25.226 --> 01:12:27.644
And they turn out
to be the most

934
01:12:27.728 --> 01:12:29.980
delightful people

935
01:12:30.064 --> 01:12:31.940
you will ever meet
in your life.

936
01:12:32.024 --> 01:12:34.275
Hmm, that's nice.

937
01:12:48.207 --> 01:12:49.708
Where'd you grow up?

938
01:12:51.127 --> 01:12:52.752
I grew up in New York,

939
01:12:53.713 --> 01:12:57.048
and I moved to Los Angeles
when John and I got married.

940
01:12:58.092 --> 01:12:59.926
But it's so different there.

941
01:13:00.594 --> 01:13:02.262
Yeah, I know.

942
01:13:04.598 --> 01:13:06.766
John thinks
I'm so snotty.

943
01:13:27.329 --> 01:13:28.872
You're not hopeless.

944
01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:55.703
Hello?

945
01:16:56.372 --> 01:16:57.372
<i>Mr. Harris?
A fax for you.</i>

946
01:16:57.456 --> 01:16:58.790
Yes.

947
01:16:58.916 --> 01:17:01.251
Okay. Can you send it up?

948
01:17:01.335 --> 01:17:02.877
Do you think you could
kick it under the door for me,

949
01:17:02.962 --> 01:17:04.754
slide it under the door
for me, please?

950
01:17:04.838 --> 01:17:06.422
<i>Do you want I send it
to your room?</i>

951
01:17:06.507 --> 01:17:08.925
Just slide it under the door,
please. Thank you.

952
01:17:09.009 --> 01:17:10.176
<i>Okay. Thank you,
Mr. Harris.</i>

953
01:17:10.261 --> 01:17:11.261
All right, bye.

954
01:17:46.839 --> 01:17:50.049
Hey, Ms. Kawasaki.
It's Bob Harris.

955
01:17:50.718 --> 01:17:54.137
Yes, I would love to
do his talk show.

956
01:17:54.346 --> 01:17:55.513
I would.

957
01:17:56.849 --> 01:17:59.225
I would love to change
my plans and stay.

958
01:18:16.869 --> 01:18:18.578
...American movie star...

959
01:18:25.377 --> 01:18:27.503
Ladies and gentlemen,

960
01:18:27.588 --> 01:18:30.757
Mr. Bob Harris!

961
01:18:30.841 --> 01:18:32.050
Come on!

962
01:18:36.513 --> 01:18:38.139
Whoo!

963
01:18:38.223 --> 01:18:39.974
Come on, Bob.
Come on, Bob.

964
01:18:40.059 --> 01:18:42.435
Bobby, come on!
Bobby, come on!

965
01:18:43.228 --> 01:18:45.271
Nice to meet you.

966
01:18:49.193 --> 01:18:51.611
He said you guys
are e-mailing together.

967
01:18:58.869 --> 01:19:00.703
He wants to show you
his dance.

968
01:19:00.788 --> 01:19:01.746
Japanese dance step.

969
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:03.206
Japanese dance.

970
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:04.874
Do I... Do I have
to dance with him?

971
01:19:10.089 --> 01:19:13.132
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby... Bobby.

972
01:19:14.468 --> 01:19:15.885
Welcome, Bob.
What?

973
01:19:15.969 --> 01:19:17.345
He was saying,
"Welcome, Bob."

974
01:19:57.177 --> 01:19:59.137
<i>- Hello?
- Bob?</i>

975
01:20:01.348 --> 01:20:02.515
Hi, Lydia.

976
01:20:02.808 --> 01:20:04.392
<i>ls this a bad time?</i>

977
01:20:05.436 --> 01:20:07.270
No, it's always a good time.

978
01:20:07.855 --> 01:20:11.107
<i>Look, your burgundy carpet
isn't in stock.</i>

979
01:20:11.191 --> 01:20:15.069
<i>It's gonna take 12 weeks. Did
you like any of the other colors?</i>

980
01:20:18.490 --> 01:20:21.200
Whatever you like.
I'm completely lost.

981
01:20:22.536 --> 01:20:24.203
<i>It's just carpet.</i>

982
01:20:25.372 --> 01:20:26.956
That's not what
I'm talking about.

983
01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.167
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

984
01:20:31.670 --> 01:20:34.130
I don't know.
I just want to get healthy.

985
01:20:34.214 --> 01:20:37.216
You know, I want to take
better care of myself.

986
01:20:37.301 --> 01:20:40.303
I would like to start
eating healthier.

987
01:20:40.471 --> 01:20:42.680
I don't want all that pasta.

988
01:20:42.764 --> 01:20:43.931
What?

989
01:20:44.433 --> 01:20:47.268
I would like to start eating,
like, Japanese food.

990
01:20:48.645 --> 01:20:52.315
<i>Well, why don't you just stay
there, and you can have it every day?</i>

991
01:20:57.237 --> 01:20:58.946
How are the kids doing?

992
01:20:59.948 --> 01:21:02.575
<i>They're fine.
They miss their father.</i>

993
01:21:02.743 --> 01:21:05.786
<i>But they're getting used
to you not being here.</i>

994
01:21:05.871 --> 01:21:08.289
<i>Do I need to worry
about you, Bob?</i>

995
01:21:09.875 --> 01:21:11.751
Only if you want to.

996
01:21:13.253 --> 01:21:17.173
<i>Bob, I got things to do.
I gotta go.</i>

997
01:21:17.883 --> 01:21:19.008
Okay.

998
01:21:20.093 --> 01:21:22.428
<i>I'll see you... I mean,
I'll talk to you later.</i>

999
01:21:22.513 --> 01:21:23.804
Okay.

1000
01:21:24.348 --> 01:21:25.806
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

1001
01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:27.600
Bye.

1002
01:22:06.848 --> 01:22:10.643
We have Matthew Smellick!

1003
01:22:11.061 --> 01:22:13.938
Matthew Snellick.

1004
01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.738
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1005
01:22:22.823 --> 01:22:23.948
We'll take a really
short break,

1006
01:22:24.032 --> 01:22:25.575
and we'll see you
in a minute.

1007
01:22:32.541 --> 01:22:34.875
Hi. Champagne. Thanks.

1008
01:22:41.508 --> 01:22:42.675
Hi.

1009
01:22:59.985 --> 01:23:03.446
<i>Midnight at the oasis</i>

1010
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:06.032
<i>Send your camel to bed</i>

01:23:06.116 --> 01:23:09.577
<i>Shadows paintin' our faces</i>

<i>Heaven's holding a half moon</i>

1014
01:23:23.133 --> 01:23:24.383
I got it.

1015
01:23:28.055 --> 01:23:29.555
Have a rough night?

1016
01:23:32.225 --> 01:23:34.977
I'm going to that place, that
sushi place in Daikanyama.

1017
01:23:35.062 --> 01:23:36.270
You wanna come?

1018
01:23:36.355 --> 01:23:37.772
Yeah, but I can't
right now.

1019
01:23:39.399 --> 01:23:43.152
<i>Midnight at
the oasis Send your cameI to bed</i>

1020
01:23:43.236 --> 01:23:45.529
Yeah, I guess
you're busy, huh?

1021
01:23:45.614 --> 01:23:48.407
<i>Shadows paintin' our faces</i>

1022
01:23:49.117 --> 01:23:52.370
<i>Traces of romance in our heads</i>

1023
01:23:58.418 --> 01:23:59.627
Hello?

1024
01:23:59.711 --> 01:24:01.420
<i>Hello? Bob, it's me.</i>

1025
01:24:01.755 --> 01:24:02.755
Hello?

1026
01:24:02.964 --> 01:24:04.924
<i>It's Lydia, your wife.</i>

1027
01:24:05.092 --> 01:24:07.510
Oh, I'm...
I couldn't hear you.

1028
01:24:07.594 --> 01:24:09.428
<i>Do you want to talk to Zoe?</i>

1029
01:24:09.513 --> 01:24:10.638
Yeah.

1030
01:24:10.931 --> 01:24:13.057
<i>Zoe, come say hello
to your father.</i>

1031
01:24:13.141 --> 01:24:14.308
<i>No.</i>

1032
01:24:14.518 --> 01:24:15.976
<i>She just ran into
the other room.</i>

1033
01:24:16.061 --> 01:24:17.978
It's okay. It's okay.

1034
01:24:18.855 --> 01:24:22.149
<i>Okay. Her ballet recital
is Sunday. Don't forget.</i>

1035
01:24:22.234 --> 01:24:23.567
I didn't forget.

1036
01:24:24.277 --> 01:24:26.404
<i>Well, travel safely.
I'll see you soon.</i>

1037
01:24:26.488 --> 01:24:28.197
<i>Mommy!</i>

1038
01:24:28.281 --> 01:24:29.240
Okay.

1039
01:24:29.324 --> 01:24:30.825
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

1040
01:24:31.368 --> 01:24:32.451
Bye.

1041
01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:45.631
Well, she is closer
to your age.

1042
01:24:48.468 --> 01:24:51.637
You could talk about things
you have in common, like

1043
01:24:53.014 --> 01:24:54.640
growing up in the '50s.

1044
01:24:55.726 --> 01:24:58.185
Maybe she liked the movies
you were making in the '70s,

1045
01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:00.396
when you still
were making movies.

1046
01:25:00.981 --> 01:25:03.899
Wasn't there anyone else there
to lavish you with attention?

1047
01:25:12.951 --> 01:25:14.994
I'm switching to beer.
Okay?

1048
01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.334
I can't tell
the difference.

1049
01:25:27.924 --> 01:25:29.550
We'll have two
of these, okay?

1050
01:26:23.355 --> 01:26:25.481
<i>... to your nearest exit</i>

1051
01:26:26.066 --> 01:26:28.192
<i>and leave the building.</i>

1052
01:26:29.277 --> 01:26:32.404
<i>Await instructions
from the authorities.</i>

1053
01:26:54.803 --> 01:26:56.762
That was the worst lunch.

1054
01:26:56.847 --> 01:26:58.055
So bad.

1055
01:26:59.182 --> 01:27:02.142
What kind of restaurant
makes you cook your own food?

1056
01:27:09.234 --> 01:27:10.776
When are you leaving?

1057
01:27:13.530 --> 01:27:14.738
Tomorrow.

1058
01:27:19.452 --> 01:27:20.786
I'll miss you.

1059
01:27:35.552 --> 01:27:38.470
<i>I'm so into you</i>

1060
01:27:40.974 --> 01:27:43.517
Whoo-hoo

1061
01:27:48.106 --> 01:27:51.317
<i>When you walked
into the room</i>

1062
01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:55.487
<i>There was voodoo in the vibes</i>

1063
01:27:59.701 --> 01:28:02.578
<i>I was captured by your style</i>

1064
01:28:03.705 --> 01:28:06.999
<i>But I could not
catch your eyes</i>

1065
01:28:12.505 --> 01:28:14.214
I don't want to leave.

1066
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:17.718
So don't. Stay here with me.

1067
01:28:19.763 --> 01:28:21.472
We'll start a jazz band.

1068
01:28:26.645 --> 01:28:30.356
<i>I am so into you, baby</i>

1069
01:28:51.670 --> 01:28:53.629
Good night.
Good night. Okay.

1070
01:28:53.713 --> 01:28:55.005
Good night.

1071
01:29:05.767 --> 01:29:06.809
Okay.

1072
01:29:06.893 --> 01:29:08.811
Okay. Good night.
Good night.

1073
01:29:42.262 --> 01:29:44.263
Good morning, Mr. Harris.
Have a nice flight.

1074
01:29:44.347 --> 01:29:45.347
Thank you.
Thank you.

1075
01:29:45.432 --> 01:29:46.765
Goodbye.

1076
01:29:48.601 --> 01:29:50.102
I'll be one minute.

1077
01:30:00.655 --> 01:30:04.199
Charlotte, I'm down in the
lobby, and I'm leaving now.

1078
01:30:05.577 --> 01:30:06.910
I was calling

1079
01:30:06.995 --> 01:30:09.413
to see if you still
have my jacket.

1080
01:30:09.497 --> 01:30:11.498
If you could bring it down,
but you're not there,

1081
01:30:11.583 --> 01:30:15.085
so this is goodbye, and...

1082
01:30:17.547 --> 01:30:19.006
So,

1083
01:30:20.133 --> 01:30:23.635
I guess, goodbye and enjoy
my jacket which you stole

1084
01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:24.970
from me.

1085
01:30:33.146 --> 01:30:34.646
Hello.
Hello.

1086
01:30:34.731 --> 01:30:36.106
How are you?

1087
01:30:36.191 --> 01:30:37.399
I'm good.
How are you?

1088
01:30:38.068 --> 01:30:40.152
Mr. Harris,
thank you for coming.

1089
01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:41.987
Enjoy your trip?

1090
01:30:42.072 --> 01:30:43.072
I had a great time.

1091
01:30:43.156 --> 01:30:45.074
I had a very good time.

1092
01:30:47.243 --> 01:30:48.619
Excuse me.
Aren't you Bob Harris?

1093
01:30:48.703 --> 01:30:49.745
Yes, I am.

1094
01:30:49.829 --> 01:30:51.163
I'm such a big fan.
So nice to meet you.

1095
01:30:51.247 --> 01:30:52.831
Thank you very much.
Nice to meet you.

1096
01:30:52.916 --> 01:30:54.541
What are you doing
here in Japan?

1097
01:30:54.626 --> 01:30:55.876
I have to go right now.

1098
01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:56.919
Excuse me one second.

1099
01:30:57.003 --> 01:30:58.170
Okay. Well...

1100
01:30:58.630 --> 01:30:59.838
Hi.
Hi.

1101
01:31:00.131 --> 01:31:01.799
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1102
01:31:01.883 --> 01:31:02.966
Thought I'd missed you.

1103
01:31:10.892 --> 01:31:11.934
Are you going right now?

1104
01:31:12.018 --> 01:31:14.353
Yeah. And my bodyguards
are right here.

1105
01:31:21.319 --> 01:31:23.946
All right. Aren't you
gonna wish me

1106
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:25.614
"Have a good 'fright,"'
or something?

1107
01:31:25.698 --> 01:31:27.241
Yeah, right.

1108
01:31:33.164 --> 01:31:35.082
Okay. Well, bye.

1109
01:31:35.166 --> 01:31:36.375
All right.

1110
01:31:37.585 --> 01:31:39.711
Can I take
one more picture?

1111
01:31:39.796 --> 01:31:41.046
Sure.

1112
01:32:36.186 --> 01:32:39.146
Hey, hold on here.
Let me out. Thank you.

1113
01:33:01.085 --> 01:33:02.461
Hey, you.

1114
01:33:32.533 --> 01:33:34.326
Okay?
Okay.

1115
01:33:58.309 --> 01:33:59.851
Bye.

1116
01:34:00.311 --> 01:34:01.436
