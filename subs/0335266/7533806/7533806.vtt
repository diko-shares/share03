MAN ON TAPE: Did you ever wonder
what your purpose in life is?

435
00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:17.695
This book is about finding
your soul's purpose or destiny.

436
00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:21.824
Every soul has its path, but
sometimes that path is not clear.

437
00:28:22.492 --> 00:28:24.368
The Inner Map Theory
is an example

438
00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:26.453
of how each soul
begins with an imprint,

439
00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:29.998

has been selected by your soul

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:46.849
is because I really feel

I really feel...

445
00:28:49.936 --> 00:28:53.397
That's part of what drew me
to Midnight Velocity as well,

I'll be one minute.

1266
01:29:48.674 --> 01:29:52.219
Charlotte, I'm down in the
lobby, and I'm leaving now.

1267
01:29:53.596 --> 01:29:54.930
I was calling

1268
01:29:55.014 --> 01:29:57.432
to see if you still
have my jacket.

1269
01:29:57.517 --> 01:29:59.518
If you could bring it down,
but you're not there,

1270
01:29:59.602 --> 01:30:03.105
so this is goodbye, and...

1271
01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:07.025
So,

1272
01:30:08.152 --> 01:30:11.655
I guess, goodbye and enjoy
my jacket which you stole

1273
01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:12.989
