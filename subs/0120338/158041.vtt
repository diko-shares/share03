HEALTHY COOKING

2
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:32,173
GUTS OF A BEAUTY

3
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:55,093
That's okay.
-Thank you very much. Come again.

4
00:02:45,518 --> 00:02:47,383
Let me go.

5
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:09,031
Thanks for coming.

6
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:08,325
My turn? I'll pass, thank you.

7
00:04:08,902 --> 00:04:11,302
It's your own doing.

8
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:14,668
But did the lchiyama clan
bring her here?

9
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:22,681
I'm sorry. Higashi, you must
apologise as well.

10
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:26,341
I'm very sorry. I said too much.

11
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,121
You said too much?
You mean it slipped out.

12
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:38,958
Sorry. I'll take over for today.

13
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:40,960
Okay.

14
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,331
No. Sister, let me go.
What's wrong with you, sister?

15
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,061
Stop that.

16
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:56,708
Higashi, explain it to her.
About her fate.

17
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:24,760
We sold your sister in Africa.
Higashi arranged it all.

18
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:30,069
Higashi, tell her.

19
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:35,973
You will never be a really tough guy.

20
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,009
Isn't this enough?

21
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:46,752
No. She's pathetic.
We can grab her.

22
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,997
That hurts.

23
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:26,358
Higashi, do it. The Angel Rain.

24
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:29,696
Angel Rain?

25
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,237
That is too strong for her.

26
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:38,237
Just use the regular dope.
-Vermin.

27
00:08:57,824 --> 00:09:04,696
You should be grateful and excited.
This is very expensive dope.

28
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:14,031
This wimp here has sold your sister
in Africa via Manilla.

29
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:18,440
You will be next.

30
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:34,419
She's a virgin...and then the effect
of this very special dope.

31
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:42,825
You. Do you have anything to do
with the dope?

32
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:43,794
Quickly.

33
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:35,338
Ken, about the next job...
Don't screw it up.

34
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:40,315
You guys, take it easy
with the merchandise.

35
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,049
Aquarium Clinic. Hospital.

36
00:12:57,496 --> 00:12:59,794
What's happened?

37
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,959
Help me.

38
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:41,304
I was with my sister.

39
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:45,801
She transferred 206 million yen...

40
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:50,473
...through the computer
to a non-existing account.

41
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:55,277
This bad guy Higashi,
her boyfriend...

42
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:58,413
...l found out where he is.

43
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:08,096
My sister vanished a month ago.
Higashi would take me to her.

44
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:18,771
I was tricked.
Oh god, I need that dope...

45
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:25,011
...Angel Rain.

46
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:32,414
Angel Rain.

47
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:03,978
No, don't kill yourself.
That dope has messed you up.

48
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:05,920
Calm down.

49
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:08,159
Help her.

50
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:29,272
Higashi, together with the yakuza
clan lchiyama...

51
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:32,714
...used my sister and took the money.

52
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:35,985
My sister did not know
she was being tricked.

53
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:40,922
She believed Higashi
and continued to give him money.

54
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,096
In the end, they sold her in Africa,
via the Philippines.

55
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:50,101
She will never come back alive.

56
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:55,701
I finally found Higashi to ask for
my sister's whereabouts...

57
00:15:55,941 --> 00:16:03,245
...but they injected me with dope
and raped me, again and again.

58
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:17,123
I wish I could help.

59
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:03,058
Yes.

60
00:19:04,797 --> 00:19:06,264
I understand.

61
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:14,969
What's up?

62
00:19:15,207 --> 00:19:16,970
She ran away.

63
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:22,080
Kill the guys who had to watch her.

64
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:26,717
How's the boss?

65
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:31,982
You know better where he is
than I do.

66
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,183
What if I did?

67
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:38,328
Haven't seen him for a while.
The idiot.

68
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:41,922
He's probably out
chasing some young girl.

69
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,994
Leave me some dope.

70
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,361
I gave you some last time.

71
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:49,802
I don't have it anymore.

72
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:51,771
You use too much.

73
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,242
Never mind.
Just leave some for me.

74
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:57,246
If the boss finds out,
you'll be in trouble.

75
00:19:57,382 --> 00:20:02,342
Not if you keep your mouth shut.
-You know I can't say anything.

76
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:11,054
That's right. And I can't tell him
I'm screwing you for dope.

77
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:03,214
Are you sure nobody talked?
-I think so.

78
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:07,742
You think?
-No, no...l'm sure.

79
00:21:10,322 --> 00:21:14,088
You have no confidence at all.
-I'm sorry.

80
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:20,989
Listen, you must erase all traces
of the dead girl.

81
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:25,069
During an autopsy they might find
the dope.

82
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:38,013
Have you been using it for long?
The dope, I mean.

83
00:21:38,517 --> 00:21:42,248
No, no, just two or three times.

84
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:44,515
Stupid idiot.

85
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,122
She was your responsibility.

86
00:21:47,326 --> 00:21:53,026
You'd better be prepared
that the boss will find out.

87
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:55,526
Idiots.

88
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:11,046
Damn, why should I take responsibility
for unimportant yakuza?

89
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:42,104
Hello. Higashi speaking.

90
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:46,408
You injected dope and had me raped.

91
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:48,109
Who is this?

92
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:52,417
Damn you. Everybody raped me.
I curse you all.

93
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:54,991
Who are you?
-I'll get my revenge.

94
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:57,391
What do you want?

95
00:23:21,286 --> 00:23:23,447
Yes, lchiyama here.

96
00:23:25,357 --> 00:23:28,986
It's Higashi.

97
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:42,304
It's me. What? From that girl?
You're joking.

98
00:23:42,441 --> 00:23:47,401
Dead girls don't use the telephone.
Don't be a wimp.

99
00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:54,743
I was ordered to remove all traces
of her, so just shut up.

100
00:23:55,153 --> 00:24:00,352
Don't ever mention it again.
Your life is at stake.

101
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:04,991
Do you understand?
Keep your mouth shut.

102
00:24:09,835 --> 00:24:14,272
You must all keep quiet.

103
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:21,373
Even if they rip your mouth apart,
you keep quiet.

104
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:32,746
How could this happen?
I will find out.

105
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:09,157
I am Kenji Higashi. I have a feeling
we have met before.

106
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:16,427
So do l. How do you do?
My name is Yoshimi.

107
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:20,796
Yoshimi?
-What's wrong?

108
00:25:20,906 --> 00:25:22,737
Nothing.

109
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:27,311
Tell me.
I can see something is wrong.

110
00:25:28,013 --> 00:25:32,416
It's nothing, really. It's just that
I used to know someone...

111
00:25:32,717 --> 00:25:36,744
You knew someone named Yoshimi?

112
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:41,253
Was this recently?

113
00:25:41,493 --> 00:25:45,361
You didn't treat her well?
-Let's change the subject.

114
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:49,160
Good idea. We have only just met.

115
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:52,930
We should not be talking about
another woman.

116
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:55,239
Excuse me.

117
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:33,396
I haven't taken a bath yet.
Can you smell it?

118
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:50,370
What's the matter, Higashi?
I don't like this.

119
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:54,018
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's wrong.

120
00:28:54,486 --> 00:29:00,391
Maybe you have been
under some stress?

121
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:02,860
That's nonsense.

122
00:29:02,994 --> 00:29:07,124
I am a psychiatrist.

123
00:29:07,432 --> 00:29:13,462
Trust me and lie down.

124
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:16,864
I'll turn you into a real man.

125
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:30,952
Just relax. Like this.

126
00:29:31,322 --> 00:29:35,258
That's good.

127
00:29:36,494 --> 00:29:43,229
Pretend you are a bird
flying in the sky.

128
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:54,340
Can you see the ocean?

129
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:02,242
It is the ocean.
Look, there is a plane.

130
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:05,154
What is its destination?

131
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:08,018
The Philippines.

132
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:13,689
That's right, the Philippines.
Manilla.

133
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:20,397
Look, it is Keiko lto.

134
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:25,776
She is waiting for you.
Can you see her?

135
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:32,978
Keiko, don't go.

136
00:30:35,353 --> 00:30:38,481
It wasn't my fault.

137
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,781
It was the lchiyama clan.

138
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:46,923
They sold you.

139
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:51,028
It wasn't me.

140
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,906
That's right.
It is the lchiyama's doing.

141
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:59,076
You should curse them.

142
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:10,380
Yoshioka, Nishibashi, lchiyama.

143
00:31:19,864 --> 00:31:26,201
That feels good. Mama...

144
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:32,707
Ken, you cannot be a bad boy anymore.

145
00:31:33,878 --> 00:31:39,316
The lchiyama clan made you bad.

146
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,054
The next time you are with them...

147
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:51,988
...and they call you an idiot,
you will stab them. Understand?

148
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,031
Do you understand? lf you are
called an idiot, stab them.

149
00:31:57,535 --> 00:32:02,029
Don't forget. Promise me.

150
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,934
I am scared.

151
00:32:06,077 --> 00:32:10,104
If you can promise this,
you will become a real man.

152
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:14,183
Then you will be able to ejaculate.

153
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,245
I promise.

154
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:25,121
You will be a man and you will screw
lots of girls.

155
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:35,796
Don't forget. If they call you
an idiot, you must stab them.

156
00:32:36,908 --> 00:32:43,370
Now you will ejaculate,
and when I count one, two, three...

157
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:49,043
...you will wake up
and you won't remember anything.

158
00:32:50,355 --> 00:32:53,916
And you'll want to go home.

159
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:07,364
One, two, three.

160
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:23,046
Well, Higashi, you have become
a man.

161
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:26,120
Did you do this with your mouth?

162
00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:30,216
I am rather embarrassed.
It was my first time.

163
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:34,889
I love you, Yoshimi.
Thank you.

164
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:39,394
I should be going home.

165
00:33:44,108 --> 00:33:50,741
Can I meet you at the same club
tomorrow?

166
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:10,867
You idiot.

167
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:22,205
If you say 'idiot' I must kill you.

168
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:33,916
Just wait.

169
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,085
Let's hear him out.

170
00:34:38,896 --> 00:34:43,094
That hurts.

171
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:46,965
Who did you meet, Kenji?

172
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:51,135
Call a doctor.

173
00:35:08,826 --> 00:35:11,920
Doctor Yoshimi.

174
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:15,995
What, a geisha?

175
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:27,105
No, a doctor...psychiatrist.

176
00:35:27,512 --> 00:35:29,275
Where?

177
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:42,019
At a club in Shinjuku.

178
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:49,063
You idiot. That is the place
where Yoshimi jumped.

179
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:53,996
Higashi, one more thing...

180
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,844
Aquarium Clinic.

181
00:36:02,146 --> 00:36:05,912
Yoshimi, is that you?
It's me...Higashi.

182
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,845
Higashi?

183
00:36:08,753 --> 00:36:16,853
I killed them all. Help me, Yoshimi.
They will kill me.

184
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:24,730
Calm down. Calm down, Higashi.
I'll meet you at the club.

185
00:36:27,004 --> 00:36:29,268
Please be there.

186
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:44,020
I did it. I did it.
Yoshimi, I made him pay.

187
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:19,814
Welcome.

188
00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:36,233
Can I help you, miss?
-A highball.

189
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:38,063
Coming up.

190
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:46,100
Is there a Yoshimi here?
Telephone.

191
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:09,990
Hello?

192
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:34,018
Sit down, Yoshimi.

193
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:50,134
We are all of the same clan,
so don't bother to resist.

194
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:55,335
Let's talk and have a drink.

195
00:40:03,988 --> 00:40:07,480
You don't look like a yakuza member.

196
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:12,090
Is that so?
Well, there are many kinds.

197
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:15,161
Really?

198
00:40:17,168 --> 00:40:20,103
What is your relation to Yoshimi?

199
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,430
I am Yoshimi.

200
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:26,368
Is that so?

201
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:35,317
I am impotent. Do you think
you can treat me, Dr Hiromi?

202
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:43,782
With hypnosis, for instance?
What do you say, doctor?

203
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:50,529
Higashi is dead because of you.

204
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:53,969
It is his own fault.

205
00:40:55,206 --> 00:40:58,300
You're not even related
to the dead girl.

206
00:40:59,043 --> 00:41:03,844
There's no need to go through
so much trouble for a stranger.

207
00:41:11,088 --> 00:41:12,419
Today's yakuza...

208
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:17,251
Today's yakuza must be alert
in order to survive.

209
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:33,804
How can you live with yourself?
With all this evil?

210
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:38,943
We can't live without it.

211
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:45,120
Stick to your own profession, doc.

212
00:42:26,363 --> 00:42:28,763
You fooled around with Higashi.

213
00:45:13,897 --> 00:45:16,923
I am ashamed we belong
to the same human race.

214
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:24,906
Then you can stop being human.
I'll personally dig your grave.

215
00:45:26,076 --> 00:45:30,979
You ruined our artwork.
I will rip your ass to shreds.

216
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:43,859
Wait.

217
00:45:53,137 --> 00:45:55,503
Okay, do it.

218
00:46:10,721 --> 00:46:14,179
She's biting me. Let me go.

219
00:46:32,276 --> 00:46:34,801
Too bad..

220
00:47:17,488 --> 00:47:19,353
Hold her.

221
00:47:28,232 --> 00:47:34,068
Angel Rain. Strong stuff.

222
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:39,707
It will make you feel good.

223
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:44,076
Later on you can do us a few favours.

224
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:58,390
I think you can cure my impotence.

225
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:05,733
What is this?

226
00:48:05,936 --> 00:48:07,995
That's nice.

227
00:48:15,212 --> 00:48:17,703
Good stuff.

228
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:35,154
It was too strong.

229
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:54,316
It's a pity we killed her.

230
00:49:01,992 --> 00:49:07,259
Hiromoto, get rid of her
together with Higashi's body.

231
00:49:08,165 --> 00:49:15,367
Takiguchi, you wait here
for our business partner.

232
00:51:55,799 --> 00:51:57,426
You are alive?

233
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:01,799
Give me the dope. I will do anything.

234
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:01,497
Come here. I will lick you.

235
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:54,849
I will come inside you.
Tonight we'll have plenty of fun.

236
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,023
Does this feel good?

237
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:12,060
From now on, I will teach you.

238
00:55:12,862 --> 00:55:19,825
See, you should push more
and twist and turn.

239
00:55:22,872 --> 00:55:24,669
Yes, like that.

240
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:47,355
Where did everybody go?
Stupid idiots.

241
00:57:43,379 --> 00:57:46,177
Who can it be?

242
00:58:08,772 --> 00:58:11,297
Now what?

243
01:01:25,134 --> 01:01:29,093
You idiot. What will you do
when the boss finds out?

244
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:18,284
Help.

245
01:02:20,056 --> 01:02:23,423
Please don't kill me.

246
01:02:35,872 --> 01:02:40,241
Please, I am just an unimportant
number.

247
01:02:43,446 --> 01:02:49,180
This organisation is like
a spider's web.

248
01:03:28,124 --> 01:03:30,251
Okay, Tuesday next week.

249
01:04:48,337 --> 01:04:50,703
This feels great.

250
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,500
Whenever I need dope...

251
01:04:54,243 --> 01:04:56,871
Wherever there is yakuza...

252
01:04:57,013 --> 01:04:59,948
...there will be dope.

253
01:05:37,153 --> 01:05:39,678
This feels great.
