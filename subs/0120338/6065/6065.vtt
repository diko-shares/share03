1
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,749
Love exists

2
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:24,154
Director / Maurice Pialat

3
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,119
Long ago

4
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,753
I was living in the suburbs

5
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,261
My first memory is
that of the suburbs

6
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,859
Deep in my memory, a train passes by

7
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,872
Just like in the movies

8
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:51,570
Memories and films are filled up
with objects that we dread

9
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,576
I have lived in this Courbevoie
area for a long time

10
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:04,322
Where bombs destroyed old houses but
the church saved has been cleared away

11
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,819
I replace as a victim against those
sacred stones, a school friend

12
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,829
We were singing together in class

13
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,590
To die for the nation

14
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,532
One day of Glory equals
100 years of life

15
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:30,539
The Vidal-Lablache maps awakened
in me the desire to travel far away

16
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:34,744
But they especially kept their illusion
between our poor landscapes

17
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,848
A look still pure can be read without
bitterness, here, where the slag

18
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,656
the dust and the rust are like an outcropping
of deep geological strata of stone

19
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,066
Palace, Eden, Magic, Lux, Kursaal

20
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,835
The best time of the week became
Thursday afternoons

21
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,311
Piled up in the front rows
the best seats boys and girls had

22
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,711
the full reign of two hour
forjust a few coins

23
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,923
Because the towers of the big mills of Pantin
are like a "Burg" drawn by Hugo,

24
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,727
the common glass piled up along the Ourcq
canal shines brighter than the stones

25
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,631
At 15 years old, riding a bike, it's nothing
to go past a jogger in training

26
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,238
The winter wind cutting the Polygone
of Vincennes Wood, less severe than

27
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,938
the winter wind that would follow witnessing
the Panzer test flights across the field

28
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,949
Walking, first crushes on
the border of la Marne

29
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,247
dark shadows and silent parties

30
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,051
dance steps for girls, ballrooms
would close their doors

31
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:53,064
Bathing at la Marne Yesterday Eldorado
old silent and rare, sleeping of the mud

32
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,497
Suddenly the streets are slow and silent

33
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:09,504
The fried food of Suresnes, Paris will
be tuned in to the melody of an accordion

34
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,526
The entire suburbs will be frozen as
in a favoured set of a French movie

35
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,127
At Montreuil, the Melies studio
lies in disrepair

36
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,627
That way, beauties and pleasures
disappear, without noise

37
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,834
The sad Suburb that is bored a grey
parade under the rain sang Piaf

38
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,039
The sad Suburb that is a bored
grey parade under the rain

39
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:47,050
Boredom is the main factor of erosion
in landscapes of the poor

40
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:58,856
Childhood castles disappear from adults
returning to the garden of their school

41
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,596
like at recess time then
the trains take them away

42
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,014
The Suburbs grow up

43
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,812
To be divided into small lands The Big Suburb
is the chosen land of the Little Pavilion

44
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,419
It's the craziness of small things

45
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:26,218
My little house, my little garden
a good little job a good quiet little life

46
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,925
Life spent waiting to be paid
Life spent in the working hours

47
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,329
Life full of overtime hours

48
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,027
Life framed in terms of social assistance
security, retreat, insurance

49
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,129
People that buy everything at the retail price
and sell it at the wholesale price

50
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,745
We live in the kitchen

51
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,250
it's the smallest room

52
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,848
Beside the festivities, the dining room opens
its door only during the cleaning hours;

53
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:03,587
it's the biggest room: we preciously
keep the precious things

54
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:10,193
Lives with a future that has already passed
and an eternal present constantly waiting

55
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:20,203
The Pavilion of the Suburbs can be a minor
expression of generosity of the French

56
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,109
In danger, he will disappear

57
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,615
To be deaf, the fight is not
always a silent one

58
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,231
Courage built upon the front lines

59
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,504
The Parisian region is the poorest in
the world in terms of green space

60
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,408
however, the systematic destruction
of old parks is not yet finished

61
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:30,209
massacre, along with real estate
speculation that serves the purpose

62
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,510
of artificial lure for residency guaranteed
by trees centuries old

63
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,125
Here is the coming age
of the civilian barracks

64
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:54,934
A contradictory world payable in increments
Urbanism imagined in terms of voyeurism

65
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,939
Poor materials damaged before
construction is finished

66
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:05,277
Landscape, in general being bad
we go about to abolish windows,

67
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,079
ince there is nothing to look at

68
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:18,390
Entrepreneurs keep the nostalgia of work
done for the Todt organisation alive

69
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,602
Completion of (social)
class segregation

70
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,103
Introduction of age segregation

71
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,403
Parents of the same age having the same
number of children of the same age

72
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,011
We don't choose
We are chosen

73
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,085
Model students, still as photos
are who the teachers all want

74
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,278
Shadowy games in basements of disproportion
Constraints of ready-made games Or evasion

75
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,896
Or evasion
What will be their memories?

76
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,309
Happiness will be decided
in board rooms

77
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,605
The red belt will be dyed in pink

78
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,713
Who repeats today of the French
that they are undisciplined?

79
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,916
An entire class is conditioned by landlords
ready to replace the next one

80
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,527
Class that make good elections

81
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,822
Artificial culture in artificial construction

82
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,634
Again and again
Advertising prevails against reality

83
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,219
They exist 3 km from
the Champs-Elysees

84
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:16,030
Light construction in panels and
asphalt boards That ignites very easily

85
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,443
Utensils of kerosene serve
to cook and to light

86
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:58,378
Number of microbes breathed in a meter cube
of air by a cashier in a supermarket 4 million

87
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,214
Number of words typed in a year
by a secretary: 5 million

88
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:07,319
<i>Loss of playgrounds, loss
of sports fields: 75%I</i>

89
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,825
<i>Loss of kindergartens: 99%I</i>

90
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,126
Number of colleges

91
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,631
Paris is 29

92
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,730
Sons of workers

93
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,840
<i>1 .5%I of colleges in paris</i>

94
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,732
<i>Sons of workers: 0.9%I</i>

95
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:29,336
<i>The literature department 0.2%I</i>

96
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,150
Theatres (outside of Paris): 0

97
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,445
Concert halls: 0

98
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,658
Half of the year, free time is at night

99
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,558
but every morning, comes
the fear of being late

100
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:05,103
Leave in the black of the night
Run to the station

101
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,206
Blind and chaotic commute
in crowds packed and sticky

102
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,807
Jump into a warm subway

103
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,001
The walking of endless transfers

104
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,908
Automatic doors
Piled up in overloaded trains

105
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,106
Second ride on a bus

106
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,212
Work is a delivery

107
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,018
Evening, once again

108
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,424
2 hours, 3 hours

109
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,617
4 hours of commute

110
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,547
This grey water moves only
in the morning and evening

111
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,286
The majority are up in front doing the wor
Those in the back are picking up the slack

112
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,589
The country has its hours
of an ebbing tide

113
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,666
The Bus, a millionaire in kilometres,

114
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,500
And the Worker, a millionaire in gestures

115
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,099
separated a second time, an evening
so discrete that we didn't pay attention

116
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,175
On one side, old buses with platforms
have no right to retire

117
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,705
the administration sells them
they have to start again a new career

118
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,011
On the other side, old workers

119
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,820
Old age that has to, in the spirit of each
employee, undoubtly overcome

120
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,924
old age is like a prize, like a market
that each is considered to have passed

121
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,630
They have paid for it! Paid to be old

122
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,426
The only age where we leave you alone,

123
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,629
but what a peace it is

124
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:52,037
A rest for 9,000 FF per month
The isolation in old areas... the Home

125
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,841
They wait for the far away hour to go
back to the countryside of their Childhood

126
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,046
For the time when the livestock
returned from the pastures

127
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,380
Hills covered by shadows dogs barking

128
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,281
the smell of cattle

129
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,192
A common voice, very far away

130
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,095
They could lend a hand and feel
the pages of the book,

131
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,994
The very first book they read

132
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:23,199
Outside it's cold and the dog comes
to hide between our legs

133
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,502
Mummy served the soup, it's very hot

134
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,510
Jacques stands up straight

135
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,322
The Small public gardens didn't replace
the Landscape of the lle-de

136
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,122
France where were coming, yesterday
still to Paris, meeting the Painters

137
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,429
The traveller hurries ignoring the suburbs

138
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,596
Those streets exposed more to
barricades than to parades

139
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,231
Keep secretly untouchable beauty

140
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,337
The one who could say it

141
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,275
Don't speak Nobody
taught them to read it

142
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,974
Gifted child Adolescence found
fixed and boring, definitely

143
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,985
It was not good to stay "There"

144
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,850
After being born A few
kilometres too far apart

145
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,188
Years and years of
furnished hotel rooms

146
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,990
Filled up at 10 in the same room

147
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:21,290
Punch given, punch received
Ears closed to shouting

148
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,101
At the end of working time
when the museums are closed

149
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:30,703
No promotion, no plan, no spending

150
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,209
Will stop the bleeding Nothing mustbe
left to keep the misery

151
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,405
The lesson of darkness is never
written on monuments

152
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,321
The hand of glory ordering
and directing

153
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,617
It can also beg

154
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,722
A simple change of angle is enough

155
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,819
The Styrene Song

156
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,416
Director / Alain Resnais

157
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,650
Man is served by blind matter

158
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,955
He thinks, he searches, he creates!

159
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:55,458
With his living breath
the buds of nature

160
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,963
Tremble as a forest
rustles in the wind

161
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,562
Victor Hugo

162
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,056
Oh mystic time

163
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,053
Oh plastic substance!

164
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,661
Where do you come from?
Who are you?

165
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,093
What can explain
your rare qualities?

166
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,594
What are you made of?

167
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,996
What is your origin?

168
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,899
Let us rediscover the ancestors
from the object itself!

169
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,498
Let us reverse the story

170
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,113
First here is the mold
and we surround the prototype

171
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,209
This mysterious being

172
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,615
Produces anything it wants

173
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,019
But the mold itself
is part of a press

174
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,218
Which injects the paste
and shapes the piece

175
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,642
The greatest advantage is the ability

176
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,543
To complete such work
with no further procedures

177
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,449
The mold is expensive
which is a small disadvantage

178
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,452
But it can be used
in many ways

179
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,335
Vacuum shaping is
another method of making things

180
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,031
A little suction is all it takes

181
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,081
The carefully arranged warm material

182
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,682
Gets laid out on the board

183
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,917
To enter the nozzle, a piston
and a heating adaptor are required

184
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,113
or we could say
an adapted heater

185
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:53,228
then we turn the rough polystyrene
to fine granules

186
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:02,534
And the granules on the vibrant sieve
are full of beautiful colors

187
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,391
Before turning into granules
they had been like straws

188
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:26,190
Straws of all colors and tones

189
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,575
These straws had been
arranged in a series

190
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,574
in the shape of a long cylinder
held together by screws

191
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:17,273
Which through this, colored pearls
of every variety are made

192
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,384
And how did the coloring pigment

193
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,386
Uniformly attach itself
on the polystyrene?

194
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:39,800
It needs to be rotated and hardened
before it tumbles in a rotary

195
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:50,907
That's how the polymer polystyrene
is born from the simple styrene

196
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:55,715
Polymerization occurs
when molecules combine

197
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,220
To become a complex
chemical combination

198
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,720
And in the concave belly of
a basic autoclave machine

199
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:06,763
Molecules cling to each other
like pearls linked together

200
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,759
But before that

201
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,667
The styrene was volatile

202
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,772
a colorless liquid with odor

203
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:21,568
Take a good look as this is your
only chance to see the liquid

204
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:27,779
Styrene is produced in large quantities
from overheated ethylbenzene

205
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,884
It requires catalysts such as

206
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,890
Oxide, zinc, and magnesium

207
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,688
In the past styrene was
extracted from benzoin

208
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:46,099
Of the styrax family,
a small tree found in Indonesia

209
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:55,700
From tube to tube, it proceeds
through a desert of channels

210
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:03,611
Back towards its original product
towards the abstract material

211
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,096
That circulates endlessly
while it cleans, distills, and redistills

212
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:58,692
A certain degree of temperature is needed
for ethylbenzene to explode

213
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,515
We must now ask

214
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,213
where ethylene and benzene
come from

215
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:25,621
They are extracted from
the magical liquid of petroleum oil

216
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,127
And also extracted from coal

217
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,630
To make ethylene and benzene
both petroleum oil and coal are fine

218
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:39,134
Transformed into gas
the coal combusts

219
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,637
And gives birth to these hydrocarbons

220
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,494
We should strike out
on these new paths

221
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,902
And examine why the one
and the other exists

222
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,103
Does petroleum come
from masses of fish?

223
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,211
We do not know much about coal

224
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,311
nor from where it comes

225
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,215
Does petroleum come from plankton?

226
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,617
It's a controversial question
with obscure origins

227
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,227
And petroleum and coal were
vanishing into smoke

228
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:43,225
Before that chemist came
a happy idea

229
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,633
To render the smokes solid and
to fashion Innumerable useful objects

230
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:52,139
And these obscure residues were
thus transformed into new things

231
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:57,036
And there remain other things
yet unknown Awaiting still similar efforts

232
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,749
To make them the subject
of other documentaries

233
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:25,367
Tributed to Jean cocteau

234
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:48,991
Charlotte and her Lover

235
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:55,395
Screenplay & Director
Jean-Luc Godard

236
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,421
It's me!

237
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,519
I know it's you
I knew you would come back

238
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,657
I told you

239
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,659
You missed me

240
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,159
You're stupid!

241
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,661
You never want to listen to me

242
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:28,269
I know why you came back I will tell
you came back to apologize!

243
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:32,069
It's too late! It's useless to say
anything little girl;you should just go to hell

244
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,679
It's great, I think you are the most
beautiful girl in Paris

245
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,872
It's pointless

246
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:42,077
it's predictable, with this guy
we should've guessed

247
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,587
What an idiot!
No, you really exaggerate

248
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,590
I know what you're going to tell me
It's wrong, it's really wrong

249
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,387
Of course, it didn't work!

250
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,489
It didn't work, because
it couldn't work

251
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,691
and it can't work, because
it wasn't supposed to work

252
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,892
Impossible!

253
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:03,296
You should know impossible
is a French word... stupid!

254
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,807
Me too, I can jump on anybody

255
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,810
Charlotte, what I'm blaming you
for, is not to be in love

256
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:09,810
but to believe he is in love with you
It's true, I'm not kidding

257
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,108
you have to think before you act

258
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,515
I don't blame you to believe in love
but to believe in theories of love

259
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,053
I find it wonderful
coming from girls

260
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:22,147
People says love is like a waltz
three little turns, yes, yes, yes! No!

261
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:25,262
That's why when you broke up
with me, I didn't say anything...

262
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:29,457
You came back with your head
down eight days later!

263
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,966
I ask myself
what are you doing here, so?

264
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,866
Look at what you look like now?

265
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,870
You would tell me
you couldn't guess

266
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,770
But yes! Stupid!

267
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,374
What were you thinking going
out with a guy like that!

268
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,774
I knew he would leave you

269
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,779
I expected as much! You too...

270
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,180
Me, on the contrary

271
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,379
it amazes me to see the lack
of practical sense in girls!

272
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:54,386
You have a nice little body...
I don't deny it

273
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,550
- Anyway you're a bitch!
- Oh!

274
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,594
I know, I know

275
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:01,391
he's going to hire you for next film
because you're sleeping with him?

276
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,500
No way!

277
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,099
I know him, he's the worst cad

278
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,101
Listen to what I'm telling you
dammit!

279
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,796
Ah, if only you were
good at making love!

280
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,602
Move your knee away from here!
Put your hand there! Move a bit!

281
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,266
Ah! Like that!
You have to be told!

282
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,505
I swear, you have to
see it to believe it!

283
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,136
Terrible!

284
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,347
I told you that

285
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,544
he's not the kind of guy
who thinks it's fun!

286
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,746
He doesn't care about girls!

287
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,558
I'm asking you what's going
through your mind?

288
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,660
Well, I also wonder what
are you doing with him?

289
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,455
Oh, nothing! He touches me...

290
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,858
But let me finish my sentence

291
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,363
When we were at the beach
I told you to not make fun of me

292
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,058
It's always the same... Shit!

293
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:42,366
It's not being with a guy like that
who charmed you for 3 minutes

294
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,374
when you've loved me for 3 years
that I blame you for

295
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,570
but by doing it so easily!
Even right in front of my face

296
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,477
- Don't act stupid, it's important!
- Yeah, yeah!

297
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,585
Don't tell me it's not true
I told you impossible doesn't work!

298
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,277
I knew you would come back!

299
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,781
Be serious!

300
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,583
You can't be without me!

301
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:03,285
I told you a thousand times
you're incapable

302
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,987
I know what you think
Same with me?

303
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,588
That's why, I knew you would
come back to apologize!

304
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:10,598
Don't say no!

305
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:11,997
What does that mean?

306
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,001
C'mon Charlotte
because I love you

307
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,298
you have to love me

308
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,236
If I didn't like you, fine!

309
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,741
But because I love you
you love me too

310
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,242
No!

311
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,244
I told you not to speak
No!

312
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,245
You're exhausting!

313
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,940
It's great!

314
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,551
So what, it was weird
my poor little girl!

315
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:34,625
We need to do things
with a bit of cleverness

316
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,856
Oh yeah! Poor guy!
You really want to do movies?

317
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,863
There are 12,000 other guys
you have to sleep with!

318
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,659
And besides
why make movies?

319
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,070
I find it disgraceful, disgraceful
and old fashioned

320
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,573
It's true!
What is cinema?

321
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,474
A big head making
faces in a little room

322
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,880
You have to be...
to like that!

323
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:01,678
Oh yeah! I know what I said!
It's an illusionary art

324
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,782
Novels, paintings like that

325
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,390
but not cinema

326
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,592
Everybody will tell you
you're crazy!

327
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,092
But you don't want to listen

328
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,393
You're the only girl in Parisz
who people can sleep with for free!

329
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,030
- Oh!
- But let me talk!

330
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,534
I know what you're going to tell me
You love to do that

331
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,231
Better to go walk the streets, so you
could make me some money too

332
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:26,741
It's true, When I suggested it to you
I admit that you refused, fine!

333
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:33,248
But being a hooker in a room, me
I found it a thousand times worse!

334
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,945
Me, I have the right to party
with those little, You don't!

335
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,747
Because you understand
that you're a blessed soul

336
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,948
Really! Charlotte!

337
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:44,152
Do you realise that behind the face
there is a soul, and as soon as

338
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,059
we look at the face of
a girl we see her soul!

339
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,564
For boys, it's not the same
It surprises you, huh?

340
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,467
Reminds me of a guy
from "Dupont-Bastille"

341
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,072
You know what he said?

342
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:02,077
What is most important
Ladies and Gentleman,

343
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,977
it's not love, it's not war
it's not money, it's not happiness,

344
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,984
It's not women, No! hat is the most
important, the subtleties!

345
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,578
Yes, darling. But by the time you
will understand this, it will be warm.

346
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,819
God dammit
you cut your hair!

347
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,624
But you're crazy, poor thing!
Who do you think you are?

348
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:24,030
Who do you think you look like!
France is full of idiots but you win the prize

349
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,329
I know what you'll say
but it's wrong

350
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:35,735
Unbelievable!
Girls don't know but it's so clear

351
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,043
You are stupid, by definition

352
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:42,243
Stay still, dammit!
Let me finish my sentence

353
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,046
I know what you're going to say
Why do you love me?

354
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,157
But you're stupid
Really!

355
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,752
You don't know if I love you, idiot
Well I don't like you anymore

356
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:56,162
You guessed it, My somber idiot
you came back for nothing

357
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,168
I told you if you left me and if you
were coming back without apologizing

358
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,772
I wouldn't give a shit
You could beg me

359
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,573
I would pretend
I didn't hear you. Like...

360
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,781
like that actor, when
Simone Simon told him

361
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,681
He would jump out the window
I don't know in what thing, it's...

362
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,310
- What kind of move?
- It was a film of Max Ophuls...

363
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,218
Shut up! Everything that
happens is your fault...

364
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,316
The morning we had to get married
You didn't have to fall asleep again

365
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,623
We wouldn't have be
late to City Hall!

366
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,722
It's always the same with you!

367
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,827
Girls think they have
the moral right in everything!

368
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,835
I can't deal with this!

369
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:34,835
I told you

370
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,735
it will come back to you!

371
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:39,135
I already knew you would
come back crying

372
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,238
You're wonderful Charlotte!

373
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,540
If I forgive you, it'll be a pure miracle

374
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,845
the light path
Shit!

375
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,750
A miracle of great importance!

376
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,651
Really! Everything that
happened, is a miracle

377
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,258
Picasso, you know what he
was saying about Cocteau?

378
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,162
It's a miracle to not
melt in a bath!

379
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,662
Don't open your month I knew
before that you're wrong!

380
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,461
Your biggest fault is
to speak for nothing

381
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,969
Men hate that. At your age
you should know that!

382
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,769
Don't pretend you're listening

383
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,371
It's clear that you're not listening

384
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:19,415
I know you're thinking about that guy
I know he's waiting in his car

385
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,415
So why did you come back?
Get the hell out!

386
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,712
know what you're doing

387
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:27,313
Remember! When we met, I had
a paratrooper's beret and you were

388
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,323
saying to everybody with your little voice

389
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,122
My parents kicked me out! I don't
know where I'm going to sleep

390
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,628
And stupid me said

391
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:37,830
Come sleep in my bed
I'll sleep on the sofa...

392
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,626
I feel like hitting you! Disgusting!

393
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,234
You don't want to lay a coat
in front of my feet?

394
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,637
And I'm such an idiot!

395
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,539
You didn't ask for more
huh! I touched you

396
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:50,340
- while you pretended to "sleep"
- No, No!

397
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,144
In the morning, you nothing
happened listening to Jazz

398
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,446
you were looking at yourself
naked in the mirror

399
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,952
You asked me What do
you think about me?

400
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:01,148
What do I think about you?
God dammit, but look at yourself in the mirror!

401
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,055
No, no joke, Charlotte!

402
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:06,061
When I said you had nice breasts
it was to please you...

403
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:09,064
- Oh!
- If we can't even laugh anymore, so!

404
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,568
Great!

405
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,761
I know you're not the first to whom
I predicted the worse and God knows

406
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,099
if I was always right!

407
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,006
Look at your friend Veronique
She should be slapped

408
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,203
Girls like that! Oh yeah
All the same!

409
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,804
You're always thinking that people
love you for your spirit...

410
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,716
The spirit of your ass, yes!
In order to please, we need to hate...

411
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,017
At the discotheque the first time
we saw each other sambas, mambos...

412
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,625
But the poor guys who go
there with a necktie...

413
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,019
multicolored...

414
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,622
What are they looking for?

415
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:44,334
ambas, mambos? My ass!

416
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,935
Really! They come to "grind"!

417
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,237
In... in fact, I wonder why
I waste my time?

418
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,841
It's best that you leave
That's right!

419
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:53,343
That's right!

420
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:59,441
I was tired of you using my electric
razor to shave your what? Legs!

421
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:05,049
And I'll be quiet. At least
I'll get my room back

422
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,954
And, I'll be able to go to the window
without your panties in my face!

423
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:12,927
It's true, guys living on women
I was against that. But what a burden!

424
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,158
Women, we have to beat them up!

425
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:21,467
I never wanted because for me
civilisation represents some kind of value

426
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,168
But I was stupid!

427
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,776
We have to beat them! Yes, that's it
We have to beat them up!

428
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:30,472
It's sad to say, I agree! But we need to hit
We have to! We have to hit!

429
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:34,084
Do we have to tell them anything?
Not at all!

430
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:38,177
I'll explain it, There is obviously
a link between the previous one...

431
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,290
You have to stay with me
It's Cartesian logic!

432
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,982
You love me, I love you

433
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,888
But if it's on purpose
I'm talking I'm in a play

434
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,293
Yes, I am terribly moved!

435
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,597
You knew I couldn't
be without you

436
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,894
Ah la la! Bitch! If I knew!

437
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:56,400
And the story of 40.000 FF Don't
pretend to have forgotten it,

438
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,804
No! If you leave I'm screwed
That's right! You know!

439
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,106
Just... find another guy who'll accept
everything without complaining!

440
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:06,410
The night when you didn't
come home the police

441
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,808
they couldn't stop laughing

442
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:09,517
But I don't care

443
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:10,711
I don't blame you!

444
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,616
Yes, I blame you!

445
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,056
No, I don't blame you!

446
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:20,061
Or maybe better, yes
I do blame you!

447
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:21,660
I don't know!

448
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,562
I don't blame you to
not blame yourself!

449
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,268
I know I'm a wimp

450
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,168
but it's because I love you.

451
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,270
I can't live without you.

452
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,374
Where do you want me to go
if you abandon me?

453
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,976
Please, don't leave me Charlotte!

454
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,771
Well, if you leave
I'll punch your face!

455
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,382
Me too, I have a lot connections
they contacted me from Hollywood

456
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,781
Yes! For my novel

457
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,878
Stay with me

458
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,986
As soon as my book gets published
I'll give you an "Alfa-Romeo"

459
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,083
British cars are ugly

460
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,195
I always told you
you have bad taste!

461
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,897
No! You're right. I say I'm
not making any sense

462
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,000
But it's not your fault
if I confuse everything

463
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,798
I am desperate since you left

464
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:03,400
Charlotte, don't leave me alone
please, Charlotte!

465
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,499
Yes, stay! You have no right!
If you do I'll kill myself!

466
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,910
I beg you to stay, Charlotte!

467
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,908
I know what you'll tell me

468
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:16,042
In love, men are wimps
lazy, cruel, idiots!

469
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,547
Yes, that's right! I'm a jerk

470
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,953
but deep down you
don't really hate it

471
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,856
A guy with style
you've missed it

472
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,759
Don't say it's not true!

473
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,264
I knew it. You too,
you can't be without me

474
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,762
That's why you came back?

475
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,168
No, Jean I came back to
pick up my toothbrush!

476
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,741
The Shepherd Move

477
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,857
Here is the moral of the story

478
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:10,160
The best chess player is the one who can
anticipate one step ahead of his opponent

479
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,168
Let's take a common example:
the so- called "shepherd"

480
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,465
Only a novice can be fooled

481
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,074
It's her move

482
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,889
- Are you going out?
- Yes, I'm going to meet Solange

483
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,395
Kiss her for me

484
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,100
See you tonight

485
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,362
Take off your coat

486
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,548
Do you want to drink a bit?

487
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,464
More

488
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,488
Where did you go?

489
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:52,586
I just came back

490
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,354
- Darling
- My darling?

491
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:32,261
My darling, did you know that
in order to

492
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:37,362
honor their lover
and prove their gratitude

493
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:40,067
the Jivaro Indians used
to offer them,

494
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:45,171
on the eve of the 3rd moon
a shriveled head, did you?

495
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:48,384
- a shriveled head, did you?
- Terrible!

496
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:51,385
That's what I think

497
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,684
So I would prefer
for the occasion...

498
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,487
- What occasion?
- Hmm, the occasion, this fur...

499
00:49:58,762 --> 00:49:59,694
A fur

500
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,828
- What's this
- A fur

501
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:11,432
Do you like it?

502
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:16,437
Here is the animal fur
that will be the plot of the game

503
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,844
Clear Italian- style attack

504
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:19,949
Stop moving

505
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:26,856
The curtains

506
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,170
Thief!

507
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:42,972
You're not going to sleep with it

508
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,066
What are we gonna do?

509
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,568
Why?

510
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,271
- About Jean
- Jean?

511
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,676
I can't tell him, uhh...

512
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,383
Of course not

513
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,882
So, what are we gonna do?

514
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,853
Make something up

515
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,016
Tell him you found it,

516
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,222
that you won it

517
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:10,731
- Be serious
- So, well... think of something yourself!

518
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:15,232
I have an idea, but I don't know...
You'll make fun of me

519
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:16,532
C'mon, say it...

520
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:30,753
Their plan is simple

521
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,650
Put the fur in a suitcase

522
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:36,156
Go to some train station
and act like a traveler

523
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,357
I just got back

524
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,327
- It's done
- Did everything go okay?

525
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,333
It's 1 1 Dames Augustines Street

526
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,045
How will I tell him?

527
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,049
- What?
- Where I found it

528
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,348
Wait...

529
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,156
the perfect crime...

530
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,009
- Yvonne, Is my husband here?
- Yes, Madam

531
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:11,914
Good evening, darling

532
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,022
Good evening

533
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,622
I'm a bit late I took a slow cab

534
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,724
- Can we eat soon?
- Yes, right now

535
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,628
- Claire
- Yes?

536
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,728
I would like to go to bed early I have
to go to the office tomorrow morning

537
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,230
Yvonne, when will it be ready...

538
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:44,747
I'm tired

539
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,352
What would I do if...

540
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,357
If what, sweetie?
I will take a rest

541
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,103
- Look
- What's that?

542
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,209
Do you see It's a locker ticket
It was on the floor in the taxi

543
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,709
- Why did you pick it up?
- Well, uh...

544
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,512
You should have left it

545
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,808
- What do I do now?
- Just throw it away

546
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:13,916
We can't What if...

547
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,712
- You should have given it to the driver
- Ah, I didn't think of that

548
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:17,911
To bad Throw it away

549
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:19,822
Maybe it's something expensive

550
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,922
I don't know, sweetie
Put it under the vase

551
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,058
You're wrong

552
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:09,165
You think so
Wrong about what?

553
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:10,873
About the locker ticket

554
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,375
Why? What do you want me to do?

555
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,675
We should look

556
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,577
We never know what it is

557
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,184
Maybe there's an address

558
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:28,281
if it was important, they wouldn't
have lost it like that...

559
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:32,287
They would have paid more attention

560
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,300
However it's not much

561
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,800
If it was really valuable
they could go to the locker

562
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,103
The clerk would recognize them

563
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,501
How could he?

564
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:50,303
Sure he could They would describe
what they left inside

565
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:51,705
Yvonne!

566
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,548
Did you order the stuff?

567
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,348
Stuff?

568
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,058
The things for tomorrow evening

569
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,262
You will give them something to eat

570
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,860
Of course, sure

571
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,269
It is tomorrow evening, isn't it?

572
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:24,371
Because I called Chichette

573
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,478

574
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,281
Of course, it's tomorrow

575
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,380
So you don't want to do anything?

576
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:38,689
I will play a little bit of
piano for them

577
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,589
Not for that
For the locker ticket

578
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,292
What locker ticket?

579
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,167
- That's it?
- It's Monday

580
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,164

581
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,169
I'll go tomorrow morning

582
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,979
- It's becoming a habit
- But did you hear what I said?

583
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,280
I'll go to the locker tomorrow morning

584
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,980

588
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,594
Do you want me to go?
Do you really want me to?

589
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,791

00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,945
The next morning
The game continues

593
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,051
Claire places her "bishop"

594
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,966
You're lovely

595
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,169
I'm a fool, yes

596
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,272
Bye bye, my little darling

597
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:36,763

614
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,310
- But it's my grey jacket
- I've never seen it before

615
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,421
It's been more than a year

616
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,714
- Don't you like it?
- I do...

617
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:08,915
Try it on

01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,142

It's possible
