1
00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.460
This dam project
will create many new jobs.

2
00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:10.966
The Party and country
will assist in your relocation.

3
00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:14.177
Grandma, give me your hand.

4
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.055
- But where are they taking us?
- It'll be all right.

5
00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:23.520
Brother!

6
00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:26.356
Grandma, I will send you money.

7
00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.655
Who can write?

8
00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:35.824
Who can read?

9
00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:38.410
Who can weld?

10
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.818
I put a lot of faith
into your organization.

11
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:58.406
It's a perfect replica, Roland.

12
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.117
There are too many fanatics out there
that could damage her.

13
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:05.664
Just think about the beautiful Buddha
statues they blew up in Afghanistan.

14
00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:10.794
Our Heritage Organization
has already made selections...

15
00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:13.797
from the British Museum
and L'Hermitage.

16
00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:24.140
I guess she'll be safe now,
tucked away...

17
00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:29.521
hidden in some bunker
in Switzerland.

18
00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:33.108
Perfectly safe, Roland.

19
00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:37.195
Only infrared analysis
would reveal the difference.

20
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.615
But it's still a fake.

21
00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:46.754
Laura, can you hear me?

22
00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:48.631
Roland, is that you?

23
00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.758
Laura, they lied to us.

24
00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:53.177
I've arranged a press conference
for tomorrow.

25
00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:55.763
I will tell everyone the truth
about what's going on.

26
00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:57.432
What are you talking about?

27
00:16:57.599 --> 00:16:59.142
The art you collected...

28
00:16:59.893 --> 00:17:01.561
it's not in the Alps.

29
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.104
Those tunnels are empty.

30
00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:04.355
I have proof!

31
00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:08.609
Laura, can you hear me?

32
00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:12.363
- I'm losing you. Roland?
- Laura, can you hear me?

33
00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:05.008
- Yuri!
- Zultan!

34
00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:07.260
I feared you would not come.

35
00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:20.440
Zultan, listen to me...

36
00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:23.610
we are fighters,
we never go down...

37
00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:27.530
no matter how hard they hit us.

38
00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:31.284
Kill the bastard.

39
00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:15.662
Yuri, where are you going?

40
01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:24.341
Do not believe in something simply
because you have heard it, Nima.

41
01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:28.220
But, great Lama,
Tenzin is my brother.

42
01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:32.224
He works inside the big tunnel,
where the ships are built.

43
01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:39.774
But what is there in your wisdom,
great Lama, if Tenzin is right?

44
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.818
What if our world
is indeed coming to an end?

45
01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:56.207
It is full, great Rinpoche.

46
01:20:02.005 --> 01:20:03.047
Like this cup...

47
01:20:03.215 --> 01:20:07.718
you are full of opinions
and speculations.

48
01:20:09.721 --> 01:20:11.388
To see the light of wisdom...

49
01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:14.600
you first must empty your cup.

50
01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:33.744
Be careful with the clutch.

51
01:20:34.579 --> 01:20:36.580
It tends to slip.

52
01:20:54.891 --> 01:20:57.935
- Grandma.
- Grandpa, Nima is here!

53
01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.271
Grandma,
I got a message from Tenzin.

54
01:21:00.647 --> 01:21:03.440
He wants us to meet him
in Cho Ming at the west gate.

55
01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:07.111
He says he can get us on the ships
he's working on.

56
01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:11.365
What are you talking about?
Tenzin works on the dam.

57
01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.287
Grandma...

58
01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:20.249
the dam is a ship!
The government lied to us.

59
01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:22.668
There will be a big flood!

60
01:21:23.336 --> 01:21:24.795
We must pack up right away.

61
01:21:25.088 --> 01:21:27.715
Nima, he gave you the truck?

62
01:21:28.925 --> 01:21:31.635
We took a trip
on the Laem Song ferry once.

63
01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:34.847
Grandpa threw up the whole way.

64
01:21:36.349 --> 01:21:37.641
Let's eat first.

65
01:55:30.673 --> 01:55:31.757
Who are they?

66
01:55:31.925 --> 01:55:33.634
We found them along side
of the road.

67
01:55:34.302 --> 01:55:35.344
Send them back!

68
01:55:41.851 --> 01:55:43.393
I am a follower...

69
01:55:44.312 --> 01:55:46.021
of our great Lama Rinpoche.

70
01:55:46.814 --> 01:55:48.231
You know I cannot do that.

71
01:56:25.853 --> 01:56:29.648
We are all children of the earth.

72
01:56:29.816 --> 01:56:33.318
My plan will not work for so many,
Grandma.

73
01:56:33.486 --> 01:56:37.406
We will take them all.

74
01:57:33.796 --> 01:57:34.921
We have to hurry!

75
01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:36.757
They are leaving!

76
01:57:55.818 --> 01:57:56.818
Tenzin wait!

77
01:57:58.404 --> 01:58:00.405
Grandma, we're almost there.

78
01:58:35.358 --> 01:58:36.399
Mr. President.

79
01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.443
You've got to see this.

80
01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:51.975
Down there Oleg, you go first!

81
02:00:28.095 --> 02:00:29.346
Daddy look!

82
02:10:59.101 --> 02:11:00.977
Tenzin, almost there.

83
02:11:02.104 --> 02:11:03.646
Nima, what happened?

84
02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:20.457
Grandma, Grandpa.

85
02:18:20.959 --> 02:18:22.584
I'm sorry.

86
02:18:23.003 --> 02:18:26.880
- I could not save us.
- He has gone back in. He will fix it.

87
02:18:28.216 --> 02:18:30.509
There's no way.

88
02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:33.721
Don't lose your faith, brother.
