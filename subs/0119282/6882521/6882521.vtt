NARRATOR: <i>Long ago,</i>
<i>in the faraway land of ancient Greece,</i>

2
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.960
<i>there was a golden age of powerful</i>
<i>gods and extraordinary heroes.</i>

3
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.880
<i>And the greatest and strongest of all</i>
<i>these heroes was the mighty Hercules.</i>

4
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.560
<i>But what is the measure of a true hero?</i>

5

<i>-That is what our story is...</i>
-Will you listen to him?

6
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.640
He's makin' the story sound like
some Greek tragedy.

some sweet music with him...

13

Our story actually begins long before
Hercules, many aeons ago.

<i>The planet Earth was down on its luck</i>

17
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.720
<i>And everywhere gigantic brutes</i>
<i>called Titans ran amok</i>

18
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.920
<i>It was a nasty place</i>

19
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.920
<i>There was a mess</i>
<i>wherever you stepped</i>

20
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.400

<i>-Locked those suckers in a vault</i>
<i>-They're trapped</i>

25
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.560
<i>And on his own</i>
<i>stopped chaos in its tracks</i>

26

Didn't you want me?

loved you with all our hearts.

a true hero on Earth,

377

Exactly how do you
become a true hero?

380
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.160
First, you must seek out Philoctetes,
the trainer of heroes.

I'm hoppin' the first barge out of here.
I'm goin' home.

1194
01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.880
Fine!

1195
01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.960
Go! I don't... I don't need you.

1196
01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.680
I thought you were gonna be
the all-time champ,

1197
01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.320
not the all-time chump.

1198
01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.800
HADES: Geez Louise!
What got his goat, huh?

1199
01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.800
Baboom. Name is Hades,
Lord of the Dead.

1200
01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.920
-Hi. How ya doin'?
-Not now, okay?

1201
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.680
Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds
and I'm a fast talker, all right?

1202
01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.640
I've got the major deal in the works.
A real estate venture, if you will.

1203
01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.840
And Herc, you little devil you.
May I call you Herc?

1204
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.280
You seem to be constantly
getting in the way of it.

1205
01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.480
You've got the wrong guy.

1206
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.000
Hear me out, ya little...
Just hear me out, okay?

1207
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.240
So I would be eternally grateful

1208
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.360
if you would just take a day off
from this hero business of yours.

1209
01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.600
I mean, monsters, natural disasters.
You wait a day, okay?

1210
01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.800
-You're out of your mind.
-Not so fast, because, ya see,

1211
01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.360
I do have a little leverage
you might wanna know about.

1212
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.040
-Meg!
-Don't listen, Herc...

1213
01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.680
-Let her go!
-Here's the trade-off.

1214
01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.800
You give up your strength
for about 24 hours, okay?

1215
01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.880
Say the next 24 hours.

1216
01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.040
And Meg here is free as a bird
and safe from harm.

1217
01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.360

we carry on, we go home happy.

1220
01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.640
Nah! I mean, it's a possibility.
It happens 'cause, you know, it's war.

1221
01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.360
But what can I tell ya? Anyway,
what do you owe these people?

1222
01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:51.040
Isn't Meg, little smoochy face,
isn't she more important than they are?

1223
01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.360
-Stop it!
-Isn't she?

1224
01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.960
You've gotta swear
she'll be safe from any harm.

1225
01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.960
Fine, okay. I'll give you that one.

1226
01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.040
Meg is safe, otherwise you get your
strength right back. Yadda yadda.

1227
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.520
Fine print. Boilerplate. Okay? Done.
What d'ya say we shake on it?

1228
01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.840
Hey, I really don't have, like,
time to bat this around.

1229
01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.760
I'm kind of on a schedule here.
I got plans for August. Okay?

1230
01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.920
I need an answer, like, now.
Going once, going twice...

You're off the hook.

1240
01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.680
And by the way, Herc,
is she not a fabulous little actress?

1241
01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.360
-Stop it.
-What do you mean?

1242
01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:54.480
I mean your little chickie-poo here
was working for me all the time.

<i>I can go the distance</i>

1531
01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:53.240
<i>I will find my way</i>

1532
01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.600
<i>If I can be strong</i>

1533
01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.920
<i>I know every mile</i>

1534
01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:03.280
<i>Will be worth my while</i>

1535
01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:12.760
<i>When I go the distance</i>
<i>I'll be right</i>

1536
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.600
<i>Where I</i>

1537
01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:18.640
<i>Belong</i>

1538
01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:25.160
<i>Down an unknown road</i>

1539
01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.120
<i>You embrace my fears</i>

1540
01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.120
<i>Though that road may wander</i>

1541
01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:36.680
<i>It will lead me to you</i>

1542
01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:40.880
<i>And a thousand years</i>

1543
01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.080
<i>Would be worth the wait</i>

1544
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.560
<i>It might take a lifetime</i>

1545
01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.960
<i>But somehow I'll see it through</i>

1546
01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:55.720
<i>And I won't look back</i>

1547
01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:59.800
<i>I can go the distance</i>

1548
01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:03.640
<i>And I'll stay on track</i>

1549
01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:07.160
<i>No, I won't accept defeat</i>

1550
01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:10.920
<i>It's an uphill slope</i>

1551
01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:15.040
<i>But I won't lose hope</i>

1552
01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:21.680
<i>Till I go the distance</i>
<i>And my journey</i>

1553
01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:26.000
<i>Is complete</i>

1554
01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.360
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1555
01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:34.000
<i>But to look beyond the glory</i>

1556
01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:38.120
<i>Is the hardest part</i>

1557
01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:41.800
<i>For a hero's strength is measured</i>

1558
01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.840
<i>By his heart</i>

1559
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.880
<i>Hoo</i>

1560
01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:13.200
<i>Like a shooting star</i>

1561
01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:16.760
<i>I will go the distance</i>

1562
01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:20.080
<i>I will search the world</i>

1563
01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:24.120
<i>I will face its harms</i>

1564
01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.080
<i>I don't care how far</i>

1565
01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:31.880
<i>I can go the distance</i>

1566
01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:36.640
<i>Till I find my hero's welcome</i>

1567
01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:40.720
<i>Waiting in</i>

1568
01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:47.880
<i>Your arms</i>

1569
01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:00.760
<i>I will search the world</i>

1570
01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:05.400
<i>I will face its harms</i>

1571
01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:12.800
<i>Till I find my hero's welcome</i>

1572
01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:16.120
<i>Waiting in</i>

1573
01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:24.800
<i>Your arms</i>

1574
01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.320
HADES: <i>What d'ya say?</i>
<i>It's happy ending time!</i>

1575
01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:51.480
<i>Everybody's got a little taste</i>
<i>of somethin' but me.</i>

1576
01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.160
<i>I got nothin'. I'm here with nothin'.</i>
<i>Anybody listenin'?</i>

1577
01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.400
<i>It's like I'm...</i>
<i>What am I, an echo or something?</i>

1578
01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:03.040
<i>Hello? Hello? Am I talking to, what?</i>
<i>Hyperspace? Hello, it's me.</i>

1579
01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:04.360
<i>Nobody listens.</i>
