00:00:17.523 --> 00:00:21.107
<i>Long ago,
in the faraway land of ancient Greece,</i>

2
00:00:21.197 --> 00:00:26.428
<i>There was a golden age of powerful
gods and extraordinary heroes.</i>

3
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.132
<i>And the greatest and strongest of all
these heroes was the mighty Hercules.</i>

4
00:00:32.223 --> 00:00:35.568
<i>But what is the measure of a true hero?</i>

5
00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:38.523
<i>- That is what our story is...
- Will you listen to him?</i>

6
00:00:38.613 --> 00:00:41.403
He's makin' the story sound like
some Greek tragedy.

7
00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.922
- Lighten up, dude.
- We'll take it from here, darling.

8
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.111
<i>You go, girl.</i>

9
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.943
We are the Muses, goddesses of
the arts and proclaimers of heroes.

10
00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:55.742
Heroes like Hercules.

11
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.703
Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules."

12
00:00:57.787 --> 00:00:59.933
Ooh, I'd like to make
some sweet music with him...

13
00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:06.693
Our story actually begins long before
Hercules, many eons ago.

14
00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:08.209
<i>Ah</i>

15
00:01:08.411 --> 00:01:11.365
<i>Back when the world was new</i>

16
00:01:11.449 --> 00:01:14.161
<i>The planet Earth was down on its luck</i>

17
00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:19.834
<i>And everywhere gigantic brutes
called Titans ran amok</i>

18
00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:22.946
<i>It was a nasty place</i>

19
00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.822
<i>There was a mess
wherever you stepped</i>

20
00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.932
<i>Where chaos reigned and the
earthquakes and volcanoes never slept</i>

21
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:31.978
Say it, girlfriend!

22
00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:33.608
<i>And then along came Zeus</i>

23
00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:36.367
<i>- He hurled his thunderbolt
He zapped</i>

24
00:01:36.453 --> 00:01:39.244
<i>- Locked those suckers in a vault
- They're trapped</i>

25
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.514
<i>And on his own
stopped chaos in its tracks</i>

26
00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.997
<i>And that's the gospel truth</i>

27
00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:49.386
<i>The guy was too "Type A" to just relax</i>

28
00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.263
<i>And that's the world's first dish</i>

29
00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:52.311
Yeah, baby.

30
00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:55.060
<i>Zeus tamed the globe
while still in his youth</i>

31
00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:57.980
<i>Though, honey it may seem impossible</i>

32
00:01:58.064 --> 00:02:01.137
<i>That's the gospel truth</i>

33
00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.642
<i>On Mount Olympus life was neat
And smooth as sweet vermouth</i>

34
00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:09.638
<i>Although honey
it may seem impossible</i>

35
00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:15.753
<i>That's the gospel truth</i>

36
00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:17.430
<i>Ah, ah</i>

37
00:02:17.557 --> 00:02:21.860
<i>- Yeah yeah
- Ah, ah</i>

38
00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.465
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

39
00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:25.217
<i>Ah, ah</i>

40
00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:27.612
<i>Hey, yeah</i>

41
00:02:53.148 --> 00:02:55.577
Hercules!

42
00:02:55.704 --> 00:02:58.569
Behave yourself.

43
00:03:02.175 --> 00:03:04.005
Look at this.

44
00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:06.239
Look how cute he is.

45
00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:11.432
Hah!

46
00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:14.834
Oh, he's strong like his dad, hmm?

47
00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:18.949
Whoa! Excuse me! Hot stuff coming
through! Excuse me. One side, Ares.

48
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:22.464
Why, Hermes, they're lovely.

49
00:03:22.547 --> 00:03:24.901
Yeah, you know,
I had Orpheus do the arrangement.

50
00:03:24.983 --> 00:03:27.096
Isn't that too nutty?

51
00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:28.247
Fabulous party. You know,

52
00:03:28.338 --> 00:03:31.564
I haven't seen this much love in a room
since Narcissus discovered himself.

53
00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.243
Dear, keep those away from the baby.

54
00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:39.397
He won't hurt himself.

55
00:03:39.483 --> 00:03:41.837
Let the kid have a little fun.

56
00:03:50.508 --> 00:03:52.099
On behalf of my son,

57
00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:56.490
I want to thank you all
for your wonderful gifts!

58
00:03:56.578 --> 00:03:58.170
What about our gift, dear?

59
00:03:58.257 --> 00:04:01.286
Well, let's see here. We'll take...
Hmm, yes.

60
00:04:01.372 --> 00:04:05.763
A little cirrus
and, hmm, a touch of nimbostratus

61
00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:09.192
and a dash of cumulus.

62
00:04:12.717 --> 00:04:15.822
His name is Pegasus,

63
00:04:15.912 --> 00:04:18.986
and he's all yours, son.

64
00:04:29.973 --> 00:04:31.760
Mind his head.

65
00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:33.680
He's so tiny.

66
00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:40.432
My boy.

67
00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.428
My little Hercules.

68
00:04:44.314 --> 00:04:45.948
How sentimental.

69
00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:49.538
You know,
I haven't been this choked up

70
00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:52.970
since I got a hunk of moussaka
caught in my throat! Huh?

71
00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.486
So is this an audience or a mosaic?

72
00:04:56.576 --> 00:04:58.929
Hey, how you doin'?
Lookin' good. Nice dress.

73
00:04:59.013 --> 00:05:03.285
So, Hades, you finally made it.
How are things in the underworld?

74
00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:06.157
Well, they're just fine.
You know, a little dark, a little gloomy.

75
00:05:06.243 --> 00:05:08.313
And, as always,
hey, full of dead people.

76
00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:09.511
What are you gonna do?

77
00:05:09.597 --> 00:05:12.268
There's the little sunspot.
Little snootchie.

78
00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:15.307
And here is a sucker
for the tittle sucker, eh?

79
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.058
Here you go. Ya just...

80
00:05:19.704 --> 00:05:20.936
Sheesh.

81
00:05:21.222 --> 00:05:22.977
Uh, powerful little tyke.

82
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.611
Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff.
Join the celebration!

83
00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:27.805
Hey.

84
00:05:27.892 --> 00:05:31.925
Love to, babe, but unlike you gods
lounging about up here,

85
00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:34.437
I regrettably have a full-time gig

86
00:05:34.523 --> 00:05:37.911
that you, by the way,
so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.

87
00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.864
So, can't. Love to, but can't.

88
00:05:40.955 --> 00:05:44.702
You ought to slow down.
You'll work yourself to death.

89
00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.621
Hah! Work yourself to death!

90
00:05:49.663 --> 00:05:51.417
Oh, I kill myself!

91
00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.045
If only. If only.

92
00:05:55.135 --> 00:05:59.123
If there's one god you don't want to
get steamed up, it's Hades.

93
00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:01.803
'Cause he had an evil plan.

94
00:06:01.886 --> 00:06:06.189
<i>He ran the underworld</i>

95
00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:09.908
<i>But thought the dead
were dull and uncouth</i>

96
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:13.306
<i>He was as mean as he was ruthless</i>

97
00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.181
<i>And that's the gospel truth</i>

98
00:06:17.265 --> 00:06:21.416
<i>He had a plan to shake things up</i>

99
00:06:21.498 --> 00:06:28.200
<i>And that's the gospel truth</i>

100
00:06:36.358 --> 00:06:37.470
Pain!

101
00:06:37.556 --> 00:06:40.346
Coming, your most lugubriousness.

102
00:06:40.432 --> 00:06:42.622
Ow!

103
00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:44.945
Panic!

104
00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:47.700
I'm sorry. I can handle it!

105
00:06:54.813 --> 00:06:57.602
- Pain! Ohh!
- And Panic!

106
00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:59.442
- Reporting for duty!
- Reporting for duty!

107
00:06:59.526 --> 00:07:00.484
Fine, fine, fine.

108
00:07:00.564 --> 00:07:03.071
Just let me know
the instant the Fates arrive.

109
00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:04.828
Oh. They're here.

110
00:07:04.918 --> 00:07:07.871
What? The Fates are here,
and you didn't tell me?

111
00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:14.060
- We are worms! Worthless worms!
- We are worms! Worthless worms!

112
00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:18.493
Memo to me, memo to me.
Maim you after my meeting.

113
00:07:20.576 --> 00:07:25.644
Darling, hold that mortal's thread of life

114
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.399
good and tight.

115
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:33.868
Incoming!

116
00:07:42.307 --> 00:07:44.812
Ladies! Hah! I am so sorry that I'm...

117
00:07:44.902 --> 00:07:45.860
- Late!
- Late!

118
00:07:45.942 --> 00:07:49.015
- We knew you would be.
- We know everything.

119
00:07:49.098 --> 00:07:51.091
- Past.
- Present.

120
00:07:51.174 --> 00:07:53.124
And Future.

121
00:07:53.212 --> 00:07:55.957
Indoor plumbing, it's gonna be big.

122
00:07:56.047 --> 00:07:58.741
Great, great. Anyway, see, ladies,
I was at this party, and I lost track of...

123
00:07:58.764 --> 00:08:01.913
- We know!
- Yeah. I know you know.

124
00:08:01.998 --> 00:08:05.431
So here's the deal. Zeus,

125
00:08:05.514 --> 00:08:09.099
Mr High and Mighty, Mr "Hey, you,
get off of my cloud," now he has...

126
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.534
- A bouncing baby brat.
- We know!

127
00:08:12.624 --> 00:08:16.613
I know you know. I know.
I got it. I got the concept.

128
00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:17.656
So let me just ask.

129
00:08:17.698 --> 00:08:20.651
Is this kid gonna mess up
my hostile takeover bid, or what?

130
00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:21.768
What do you think?

131
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:25.764
No, you don't.
We're not supposed to reveal the future.

132
00:08:27.244 --> 00:08:29.196
Oh, wait. I'm sorry. Time out. Can I...

133
00:08:29.281 --> 00:08:30.896
Can I ask you a question, by the way?
Are you...

134
00:08:30.918 --> 00:08:32.989
Did you cut your hair or something?
You look fabulous.

135
00:08:33.077 --> 00:08:36.509
I mean, you look like
a Fate worse than death.

136
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:41.414
- Oh, gross!
- It's blinkin'!

137
00:08:43.221 --> 00:08:45.695
Ladies, please.

138
00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:49.124
My fate is in your lovely hands.

139
00:08:49.214 --> 00:08:51.688
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, all right.

140
00:08:54.288 --> 00:08:58.678
<i>In 18 years precisely,</i>

141
00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:04.503
<i>the planets will align ever so nicely.</i>

142
00:09:04.592 --> 00:09:05.704
Ay, verse. Oy.

143
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:08.297
<i>The time to act will be at hand.</i>

144
00:09:08.387 --> 00:09:12.539
<i>Unleash the Titans,
your monstrous band.</i>

145
00:09:12.622 --> 00:09:13.929
Mm-hmm. Good, good.

146
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:19.087
<i>Then the once-proud Zeus
will finally fall,</i>

147
00:09:19.172 --> 00:09:25.154
<i>and you, Hades, will rule all!</i>

148
00:09:25.244 --> 00:09:27.793
Yes! Hades rules!

149
00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:30.713
A word of caution to this tale.

150
00:09:30.796 --> 00:09:31.908
Excuse me?

151
00:09:31.994 --> 00:09:36.385
<i>Should Hercules fight, you will fail.</i>

152
00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:43.056
What?

153
00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:45.972
Okay, fine, fine. I'm cool. I'm fine.

154
00:09:47.612 --> 00:09:51.045
Pain? Panic? Got a little riddle for ya.

155
00:09:51.129 --> 00:09:54.157
How do you kill a god?

156
00:09:54.244 --> 00:09:57.556
- I do not know!
- You can't. They're immortal?

157
00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:59.785
Bingo! They're immortal.

158
00:09:59.877 --> 00:10:04.867
So, first you got to turn
the little sunspot mortal.

159
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:34.981
- What? What is it?
- Huh?

160
00:10:35.547 --> 00:10:36.821
- The baby!
- The baby!

161
00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:44.444
Hercules!

162
00:10:44.693 --> 00:10:46.720
Oh!

163
00:10:49.008 --> 00:10:54.391
No!

164
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.228
Now we did it!

165
00:10:56.318 --> 00:10:58.312
Zeus is gonna use us
for target practice!

166
00:10:58.394 --> 00:11:00.224
Just hang onto the kid, Panic.

167
00:11:03.867 --> 00:11:04.825
Hurry!

168
00:11:04.906 --> 00:11:07.216
Let's just kill the kid
and get it over with, okay?

169
00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:11.290
Here you go, kid.
A little Grecian formula.

170
00:11:11.936 --> 00:11:15.565
Look at that! He's changing.
Can we do it now?

171
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:20.597
No, he has to drink the whole potion.
Every last drop.

172
00:11:20.683 --> 00:11:21.752
Who's there?

173
00:11:27.075 --> 00:11:29.221
Alcmene, over here.

174
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.340
You poor thing.

175
00:11:33.427 --> 00:11:35.573
- Oh, don't cry.
- Ls anybody there?

176
00:11:35.663 --> 00:11:37.330
- Now?
- Now.

177
00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:41.689
Oh. Well,
he must have been abandoned.

178
00:11:41.855 --> 00:11:44.567
Amphitryon, for so many years

179
00:11:44.651 --> 00:11:47.604
we've prayed to the gods
to bless us with a child.

180
00:11:47.687 --> 00:11:51.555
- Perhaps they've answered our prayers.
- Perhaps they have.

181
00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:53.232
"Hercules"?

182
00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:14.280
Help, help, help!

183
00:12:14.369 --> 00:12:16.920
Hades is gonna kill us
when he finds out what happened.

184
00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:19.316
You mean, if he finds out.

185
00:12:19.402 --> 00:12:21.549
Of course he's gonna...

186
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.830
If. If is good.

187
00:12:25.474 --> 00:12:27.186
<i>It was tragic.</i>

188
00:12:27.272 --> 00:12:30.181
<i>Zeus led all the gods
on a frantic search.</i>

189
00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:33.972
But by the time they found the baby,
it was too late.

190
00:12:34.062 --> 00:12:38.454
<i>Young Herc was mortal now</i>

191
00:12:38.696 --> 00:12:42.280
<i>But since he did not drink the last drop</i>

192
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.244
<i>He still retained his godlike strength</i>

193
00:12:45.327 --> 00:12:48.237
<i>So thank his lucky stars</i>

194
00:12:48.322 --> 00:12:49.434
Tell it, girl.

195
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.192
<i>But Zeus and Hera wept</i>

196
00:12:54.554 --> 00:12:58.139
<i>Because their son
could never come home</i>

197
00:12:58.228 --> 00:13:04.897
<i>They'd have to watch their precious
baby grow up from afar</i>

198
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.730
<i>Though Hades' horrid plan</i>

199
00:13:09.813 --> 00:13:13.246
<i>Was hatched before
Herc cut his first tooth</i>

200
00:13:13.328 --> 00:13:16.956
<i>The boy grew stronger every day</i>

201
00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:21.146
<i>And that's the gospel truth</i>

202
00:13:21.236 --> 00:13:27.621
<i>The gospel truth</i>

203
00:13:37.934 --> 00:13:40.080
Hercules, slow down!

204
00:13:43.286 --> 00:13:44.244
Look out!

205
00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.593
Sorry, guys.

206
00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:49.914
- Hey, watch where you're goin'.
- Sunday driver!

207
00:13:53.952 --> 00:13:55.707
Thanks, son.

208
00:13:55.789 --> 00:13:59.374
When old Penelope twisted her ankle
back there, I thought we were done for.

209
00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:00.739
No problem, Pop.

210
00:14:00.822 --> 00:14:04.450
Uh, don't unload just yet.
First, I have to finagle with Phideas.

211
00:14:04.536 --> 00:14:05.844
Okay.

212
00:14:06.214 --> 00:14:07.883
Oops.

213
00:14:08.012 --> 00:14:09.080
Sorry, Penelope.

214
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.276
Now, Hercules, this time, please just...

215
00:14:12.366 --> 00:14:14.556
I know. I know.

216
00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:16.549
Stay by the cart.

217
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.954
That's my boy.

218
00:14:22.432 --> 00:14:24.306
Oh, my goodness. Whoa!

219
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:26.056
Careful!

220
00:14:27.146 --> 00:14:29.456
- Why, thank you.
- No problem.

221
00:14:29.542 --> 00:14:31.733
Why, Hercules!

222
00:14:31.819 --> 00:14:32.854
It's you!

223
00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:35.924
- Let me help you with that.
- No, no, no, no, no. I got it!

224
00:14:36.013 --> 00:14:38.563
I'm fine.
You just run along.

225
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.164
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

226
00:14:40.247 --> 00:14:41.763
Absolutely.

227
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.990
Yo! Give it here!

228
00:14:48.076 --> 00:14:49.983
Hey, you need an extra guy?

229
00:14:50.913 --> 00:14:51.871
Uh...

230
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.017
Sorry, Herc.

231
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:57.698
Uh, we already got five,
and we want to keep it an even number.

232
00:14:57.783 --> 00:14:59.493
Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an even...

233
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.367
- See ya, Herc.
- What a geek!

234
00:15:01.458 --> 00:15:04.847
- Destructo Boy.
- Maybe we should call him "Jerkules."

235
00:15:11.923 --> 00:15:13.471
Heads up!

236
00:15:13.561 --> 00:15:14.673
I got it!

237
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.154
No! Stop!

238
00:15:18.514 --> 00:15:19.701
Uh-oh.

239
00:15:20.311 --> 00:15:21.706
No.

240
00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:24.576
It's okay.

241
00:15:30.857 --> 00:15:32.492
Hey! Whoa!

242
00:15:37.927 --> 00:15:41.273
- Son!
- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!

243
00:15:41.362 --> 00:15:43.793
Oh, my! No! Don't! No, no, no, no!

244
00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:46.146
No, no, no, no, no, no!

245
00:15:51.869 --> 00:15:53.939
Watch out!

246
00:16:08.205 --> 00:16:10.592
Nice catch, Jerkules.

247
00:16:11.401 --> 00:16:13.069
Son...

248
00:16:14.277 --> 00:16:18.669
This is the last straw, Amphitryon!

249
00:16:19.231 --> 00:16:20.778
That boy is a menace!

250
00:16:20.868 --> 00:16:23.538
He's too dangerous
to be around normal people!

251
00:16:25.301 --> 00:16:27.415
He didn't mean any harm.
He's just a kid.

252
00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:31.170
He just can't control his strength.

253
00:16:31.253 --> 00:16:33.041
I'm warning you.

254
00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:37.119
You keep that freak away from here!

255
00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:39.712
Freak! Yeah, go away!

256
00:16:51.465 --> 00:16:56.292
Son, you shouldn't let those
things they said back there get to you.

257
00:16:56.578 --> 00:17:01.482
But, Pop, they're right. I am a freak.
I try to fit in. I really do.

258
00:17:01.971 --> 00:17:03.965
I just can't.

259
00:17:05.087 --> 00:17:10.590
Sometimes I feel like
I really don't belong here,

260
00:17:11.637 --> 00:17:15.310
like I'm supposed to be someplace else.

261
00:17:16.192 --> 00:17:18.185
Hercules, son...

262
00:17:18.269 --> 00:17:20.143
I know it doesn't make any sense.

263
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:35.522
<i>I have often dreamed of a far off place</i>

264
00:17:35.604 --> 00:17:40.792
<i>Where a great warm welcome
will be waiting for me</i>

265
00:17:40.878 --> 00:17:45.749
<i>Where the crowds will cheer
when they see my face</i>

266
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:51.376
<i>And a voice keeps sayin'
this is where I'm meant to be</i>

267
00:17:52.062 --> 00:17:54.807
<i>I will find my way</i>

268
00:17:54.898 --> 00:17:57.164
<i>I can go the distance</i>

269
00:17:57.254 --> 00:17:59.881
<i>I'll be there someday</i>

270
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:02.161
<i>If I can be strong</i>

271
00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.602
<i>I know every mile</i>

272
00:18:04.764 --> 00:18:07.716
<i>Will be worth my while</i>

273
00:18:08.639 --> 00:18:14.904
<i>I would go most anywhere to feel like I</i>

274
00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:19.215
<i>Belong</i>

275
00:18:22.459 --> 00:18:24.094
Hercules,

276
00:18:24.177 --> 00:18:29.244
there's something your mother and I
have been meaning to tell ya.

277
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.121
But if you found me,
then where did I come from?

278
00:18:33.205 --> 00:18:35.079
Why was I left here?

279
00:18:35.801 --> 00:18:40.313
This was around your neck
when we found you.

280
00:18:41.673 --> 00:18:44.059
It's the symbol of the gods.

281
00:18:44.628 --> 00:18:47.897
This is it! Don't you see?
Maybe they have the answers!

282
00:18:47.985 --> 00:18:49.739
I'll go to the temple of Zeus and...

283
00:18:52.338 --> 00:18:54.932
Ma, Pop,

284
00:18:55.573 --> 00:18:59.006
you're the greatest parents
anyone could have, but...

285
00:19:00.247 --> 00:19:01.762
I gotta know.

286
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.606
<i>I am on my way</i>

287
00:19:22.696 --> 00:19:24.647
<i>I can go the distance</i>

288
00:19:24.733 --> 00:19:27.327
<i>I don't care how far</i>

289
00:19:27.449 --> 00:19:29.639
<i>Somehow, I'll be strong</i>

290
00:19:29.726 --> 00:19:32.037
<i>I know every mile</i>

291
00:19:32.123 --> 00:19:35.512
<i>Will be worth my while</i>

292
00:19:35.598 --> 00:19:38.551
<i>I would go most anywhere</i>

293
00:19:38.634 --> 00:19:44.704
<i>To find where I belong</i>

294
00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:04.508
Oh, mighty Zeus,

295
00:20:04.598 --> 00:20:08.630
please, hear me and answer my prayer.

296
00:20:08.713 --> 00:20:10.499
I need to know.

297
00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:11.941
Who am I?

298
00:20:12.028 --> 00:20:14.414
Where do I belong?

299
00:20:20.176 --> 00:20:21.134
Huh?

300
00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:28.558
My boy.

301
00:20:28.646 --> 00:20:30.716
My little Hercules.

302
00:20:31.281 --> 00:20:33.068
Ahhhh!

303
00:20:33.597 --> 00:20:36.191
Hey, hey, hey. Hold on, kiddo!

304
00:20:36.274 --> 00:20:37.342
What's your hurry?

305
00:20:37.432 --> 00:20:41.223
After all these years, is this the kind of
hello you give your father?

306
00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:43.698
Father?

307
00:20:43.783 --> 00:20:46.650
Didn't know you had a famous father,
did you?

308
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.245
Surprise!

309
00:20:49.656 --> 00:20:51.606
Look how you've grown.

310
00:20:51.693 --> 00:20:57.119
Why, you've got your mother's
beautiful eyes and my strong chin. Hah!

311
00:20:57.764 --> 00:20:59.279
I don't understand.

312
00:20:59.362 --> 00:21:03.230
If you're my father,
that would make me a...

313
00:21:03.316 --> 00:21:06.345
- A god.
- A god.

314
00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:07.424
A god!

315
00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:09.026
Hey, you wanted answers,

316
00:21:09.109 --> 00:21:12.453
and by thunder, you're old enough
now to know the truth.

317
00:21:12.543 --> 00:21:15.976
But why did you leave me on Earth?
Didn't you want me?

318
00:21:16.099 --> 00:21:17.570
Of course we did.

319
00:21:17.657 --> 00:21:20.489
Your mother and I
loved you with all our hearts.

320
00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:24.081
Someone stole you from us
and turned you mortal,

321
00:21:24.168 --> 00:21:27.033
and only gods
can live on Mount Olympus.

322
00:21:27.523 --> 00:21:28.950
And you can't do a thing?

323
00:21:29.041 --> 00:21:30.992
I can't, Hercules, but you can.

324
00:21:31.078 --> 00:21:34.031
Really? What? I'll do anything.

325
00:21:34.114 --> 00:21:37.263
Hercules, if you can prove yourself
a true hero on Earth,

326
00:21:37.349 --> 00:21:39.256
your godhood will be restored!

327
00:21:39.346 --> 00:21:41.657
A true hero. Great!

328
00:21:42.263 --> 00:21:45.608
Exactly how do you
become a true hero?

329
00:21:45.698 --> 00:21:50.001
First, you must seek out Philoctetes,
the trainer of heroes.

330
00:21:50.092 --> 00:21:52.925
Seek out Philoctetes.
Right. I'll... Whoa!

331
00:21:53.008 --> 00:21:54.959
Whoa! Hold your horses!

332
00:21:55.045 --> 00:21:56.832
Which reminds me.

333
00:22:02.474 --> 00:22:03.542
Ha ha!

334
00:22:03.633 --> 00:22:08.504
You probably don't remember Pegasus,
but you two go way back, son.

335
00:22:15.936 --> 00:22:17.722
Oh, Pegasus!

336
00:22:18.093 --> 00:22:22.964
He's a magnificent horse
with the brain of a bird.

337
00:22:23.206 --> 00:22:24.437
Huh?

338
00:22:24.604 --> 00:22:27.591
I'll find Philoctetes
and become a true hero.

339
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.954
That's the spirit!

340
00:22:29.038 --> 00:22:30.509
I won't let you down, Father!

341
00:22:31.674 --> 00:22:32.665
Yee-haw!

342
00:22:33.471 --> 00:22:35.302
Good luck, son.

343
00:22:37.906 --> 00:22:40.499
<i>I will beat the odds</i>

344
00:22:40.582 --> 00:22:42.292
<i>I can go the distance</i>

345
00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.766
<i>I will face the world</i>

346
00:22:44.856 --> 00:22:46.763
<i>Fearless, proud and strong</i>

347
00:22:46.853 --> 00:22:49.119
<i>I will please the gods</i>

348
00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.964
<i>I can go the distance</i>

349
00:22:51.048 --> 00:22:56.790
<i>Till I find my hero's welcome
right where I</i>

350
00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:03.587
<i>Belong</i>

351
00:23:29.514 --> 00:23:31.105
Whoa!

352
00:23:34.148 --> 00:23:35.695
You sure this is the right place?

353
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.803
What's the matter, little guy?
You stuck?

354
00:23:49.885 --> 00:23:51.401
Hey, butt out, buddy!

355
00:23:51.564 --> 00:23:52.795
Ugh!

356
00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:55.714
Girls! Stop! Stop!
Come back, come back, come back.

357
00:23:55.837 --> 00:23:58.028
Whoa, whoa! Oh. Geez!

358
00:23:58.473 --> 00:24:01.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, Nymphs!

359
00:24:02.189 --> 00:24:04.901
- They can't keep their hands off me.
- Hey!

360
00:24:08.861 --> 00:24:11.531
What's the matter?
You never seen a satyr before?

361
00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:13.523
Uh, no. Can you help us?

362
00:24:13.613 --> 00:24:17.122
We're looking for someone
called Philoctetes.

363
00:24:18.127 --> 00:24:19.402
Cali me Phil.

364
00:24:19.486 --> 00:24:20.792
- Phil!
- Ow!

365
00:24:20.883 --> 00:24:23.357
Boy, am I glad to meet you!
I'm Hercules.

366
00:24:23.439 --> 00:24:25.749
This is Pegasus.

367
00:24:27.234 --> 00:24:29.348
Animals! Disgusting!

368
00:24:29.431 --> 00:24:30.946
I need your help.

369
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:33.023
I want to become a hero, a true hero.

370
00:24:34.943 --> 00:24:37.689
- Sorry, kid. Can't help ya.
- Wait!

371
00:24:38.658 --> 00:24:39.694
Uh, sorry.

372
00:24:39.777 --> 00:24:44.200
- Why not?
- Two words, I am retired.

373
00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:47.077
Look, I gotta do this.

374
00:24:47.167 --> 00:24:48.802
Haven't you ever had a dream,

375
00:24:48.884 --> 00:24:51.477
something you wanted so bad
you'd do anything?

376
00:24:54.197 --> 00:24:57.390
Kid, come inside.
I want to show you something.

377
00:25:05.302 --> 00:25:08.288
Watch it!
That was part of the mast of the Argo.

378
00:25:08.377 --> 00:25:10.044
- The Argo?
- Yeah.

379
00:25:10.134 --> 00:25:12.248
Who do you think
taught Jason how to sail?

380
00:25:12.332 --> 00:25:13.564
Cleopatra?

381
00:25:13.651 --> 00:25:16.005
I trained all those would-be heroes.

382
00:25:16.126 --> 00:25:20.713
Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.
A lot of "yeuseus."

383
00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:24.951
And every single one of those bums
let me down flatter than a discus.

384
00:25:25.034 --> 00:25:27.421
None of 'em could go the distance.

385
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.780
And then there was Achilles.

386
00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:34.814
Now, there was a guy who had it all,
the build, the foot speed.

387
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.128
He could jab, he could take a hit,
he could keep on comin'.

388
00:25:39.215 --> 00:25:41.764
But that furshlugginer heel of his!

389
00:25:41.852 --> 00:25:44.641
He barely gets nicked there once
and kaboom!

390
00:25:45.127 --> 00:25:46.598
He's history.

391
00:25:48.521 --> 00:25:50.232
Yeah, I had a dream once.

392
00:25:50.318 --> 00:25:53.665
I dreamed I was gonna train
the greatest hero there ever was.

393
00:25:53.755 --> 00:25:59.781
So great, the gods would hang a picture
of him in the stars all across the sky,

394
00:25:59.867 --> 00:26:02.972
and people would say,
"That's Phil's boy."

395
00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.892
That's right.

396
00:26:04.979 --> 00:26:06.689
Eh, but dreams are for rookies.

397
00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:08.847
A guy can only take
so much disappointment.

398
00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:11.124
But I'm different than
those other guys, Phil!

399
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.596
I can go the distance.
Come on. I'll show you.

400
00:26:14.884 --> 00:26:16.878
Geez! You don't give up, do ya?

401
00:26:17.121 --> 00:26:18.397
Watch this.

402
00:26:22.675 --> 00:26:24.548
Holy Hera.

403
00:26:24.631 --> 00:26:27.901
You know, maybe if I...
No! Snap out of it!

404
00:26:27.988 --> 00:26:30.014
I'm too old
to get mixed up in this stuff again.

405
00:26:30.104 --> 00:26:34.255
But if I don't become a true hero, I'll
never be able to rejoin my father, Zeus.

406
00:26:34.698 --> 00:26:35.689
Hold it!

407
00:26:35.776 --> 00:26:37.803
Zeus is your father, right?

408
00:26:37.893 --> 00:26:39.441
Uh-huh.

409
00:26:39.571 --> 00:26:43.003
Zeus. The big guy. He's your daddy.

410
00:26:43.086 --> 00:26:44.797
Mr Lightning Bolts!

411
00:26:44.883 --> 00:26:46.878
Read me a book, would ya, Da-da?

412
00:26:46.961 --> 00:26:49.870
- Zeus!
- "Once upon a time..."

413
00:26:49.956 --> 00:26:51.068
It's the truth!

414
00:26:51.155 --> 00:26:52.626
Please!

415
00:26:54.989 --> 00:26:57.540
<i>So you wanna be a hero, kid</i>

416
00:26:57.625 --> 00:26:59.052
<i>Well, whoop-de-do</i>

417
00:26:59.942 --> 00:27:02.252
<i>I have been around the block before</i>

418
00:27:02.339 --> 00:27:04.650
<i>With blockheads just like you</i>

419
00:27:04.736 --> 00:27:06.882
<i>Each and every one a disappointment</i>

420
00:27:06.973 --> 00:27:10.405
<i>Pain for which there ain't no ointment</i>

421
00:27:10.488 --> 00:27:13.876
<i>So much for excuses
Though a kid of "Zeus" is</i>

422
00:27:13.964 --> 00:27:17.069
<i>Askin' me to jump into the fray</i>

423
00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:19.949
<i>My answer is two words</i>

424
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.182
Okay.

425
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:26.340
- You mean you'll do it?
- You win.

426
00:27:26.426 --> 00:27:28.616
- You won't be sorry, Phil.
- Oh, gods.

427
00:27:28.703 --> 00:27:30.250
So when do we start?
Can we start now?

428
00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.330
<i>Oy vey.</i>

429
00:27:32.578 --> 00:27:37.241
<i>I'd given up hope
that someone would come along</i>

430
00:27:37.331 --> 00:27:42.082
<i>A fella who'd ring the bell for once
Not the gong</i>

431
00:27:42.164 --> 00:27:44.355
<i>The kind who wins trophies</i>

432
00:27:44.442 --> 00:27:46.272
<i>Won't settle for low fees</i>

433
00:27:46.358 --> 00:27:48.549
<i>At least semipro fees</i>

434
00:27:48.635 --> 00:27:51.425
<i>But, no, I get the greenhorn</i>

435
00:27:51.512 --> 00:27:55.782
<i>I've been out to pasture, pal
My ambition gone</i>

436
00:27:55.865 --> 00:28:00.376
<i>Content to spend lazy days
and to graze my lawn</i>

437
00:28:00.459 --> 00:28:02.769
<i>But you need an adviser</i>

438
00:28:02.855 --> 00:28:05.046
<i>A satyr, but wiser</i>

439
00:28:05.132 --> 00:28:07.681
<i>A good merchandiser and... Whoa</i>

440
00:28:08.207 --> 00:28:09.843
<i>There goes my ulcer</i>

441
00:28:09.925 --> 00:28:14.393
<i>I'm down to one last hope
and I hope it's you</i>

442
00:28:14.479 --> 00:28:18.827
<i>Though, kid, you're not exactly
a dream come true</i>

443
00:28:19.113 --> 00:28:23.417
<i>I trained enough turkeys
Who never came through</i>

444
00:28:23.506 --> 00:28:26.851
<i>You're my one last hope
So you'll have to do</i>

445
00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:28.533
Rule number six.

446
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.734
When rescuing a damsel...

447
00:28:30.817 --> 00:28:32.811
...always handle with care.

448
00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:36.366
No!

449
00:28:37.688 --> 00:28:40.433
Rule number 95, kid. Concentrate!

450
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.195
Rule number 96.

451
00:28:44.597 --> 00:28:45.948
Aim!

452
00:28:46.835 --> 00:28:51.379
<i>Demigods have faced the odds
And ended up a mockery</i>

453
00:28:51.468 --> 00:28:56.100
<i>Don't believe the stories
That you read on all the crockery</i>

454
00:28:56.182 --> 00:29:00.649
<i>To be a true hero, kid, is a dying art</i>

455
00:29:00.734 --> 00:29:02.968
<i>Like paintin' a masterpiece</i>

456
00:29:03.052 --> 00:29:05.287
<i>It's a work of heart</i>

457
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.603
<i>It takes more than sinew</i>

458
00:29:07.686 --> 00:29:09.919
<i>Comes down to what's in you</i>

459
00:29:10.003 --> 00:29:13.467
<i>You have to continue to grow</i>

460
00:29:13.557 --> 00:29:15.748
Now, that's more like it!

461
00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:21.064
<i>I'm down to one last shot
And my last high note</i>

462
00:29:21.866 --> 00:29:26.617
<i>Before that blasted underworld
gets my goat</i>

463
00:29:26.699 --> 00:29:28.770
<i>My dreams are on you, kid</i>

464
00:29:28.856 --> 00:29:30.970
<i>Go make 'em come true</i>

465
00:29:31.053 --> 00:29:32.927
<i>Climb that uphill slope</i>

466
00:29:33.011 --> 00:29:35.278
<i>Keep pushin' that envelope</i>

467
00:29:35.368 --> 00:29:37.002
<i>You're my one last hope</i>

468
00:29:37.084 --> 00:29:42.588
<i>And, kid, it's up to you</i>

469
00:29:44.236 --> 00:29:45.662
Yeah!

470
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.976
Did you see that?

471
00:29:50.066 --> 00:29:52.660
Next stop, Olympus.

472
00:29:53.303 --> 00:29:55.254
All right, just take it easy, champ.

473
00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.486
I am ready. I want to get off this island.

474
00:29:57.576 --> 00:29:59.886
I want to see battles and monsters.

475
00:29:59.973 --> 00:30:01.728
Rescue some damsels.

476
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.804
You know, heroic stuff.

477
00:30:04.247 --> 00:30:07.277
- Well...
- Aw, come on! Phil!

478
00:30:07.363 --> 00:30:10.632
Well, okay. Okay, you want a road test?
Saddle up, kid.

479
00:30:10.718 --> 00:30:12.951
We're going to Thebes!

480
00:30:14.034 --> 00:30:16.704
- So what's in Thebes?
- A lot of problems.

481
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:20.178
It's a big, tough town.
Good place to start buildin' a rep.

482
00:30:22.183 --> 00:30:26.290
Sounds like your basic DID,
Damsel in Distress.

483
00:30:32.928 --> 00:30:35.314
Not so fast, sweetheart.

484
00:30:35.404 --> 00:30:37.758
I swear, Nessus. Put me down or I'll...

485
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.347
Whoo! I like 'em fiery!

486
00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:42.464
Now, remember, kid.

487
00:30:42.554 --> 00:30:44.384
First, analyze the situation.

488
00:30:44.472 --> 00:30:46.618
Don't just barrel in there
without thinking.

489
00:30:48.466 --> 00:30:50.820
He's losin' points for this!

490
00:30:51.022 --> 00:30:52.896
- You don't know what you're...
- Halt!

491
00:30:55.776 --> 00:30:58.446
Step aside, two legs.

492
00:30:58.532 --> 00:31:02.204
Pardon me, my good sir.

493
00:31:02.287 --> 00:31:03.972
I'll have to ask you to
release that young...

494
00:31:04.044 --> 00:31:06.878
- Keep movin', junior.
- Lady.

495
00:31:06.961 --> 00:31:10.306
But you...
Aren't you a damsel in distress?

496
00:31:10.395 --> 00:31:13.348
I'm a damsel, I'm in distress.

497
00:31:13.432 --> 00:31:16.297
I can handle this. Have a nice day.

498
00:31:16.428 --> 00:31:18.018
Uh.

499
00:31:18.145 --> 00:31:20.771
Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be
too close to the situation to realize...

500
00:31:22.898 --> 00:31:23.889
Ohhh!

501
00:31:24.337 --> 00:31:27.485
- What are you doin'? Get your sword!
- Sword. Right, right.

502
00:31:27.572 --> 00:31:30.601
Rule number 15,
a hero is only as good as his weapon!

503
00:31:38.277 --> 00:31:41.263
Whoa! Hold it! Hold on!
He's gotta do it on his own.

504
00:31:41.512 --> 00:31:44.422
Come on, kid! Concentrate!

505
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:46.415
Use your head!

506
00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:48.172
Oh.

507
00:31:53.456 --> 00:31:56.125
All right! Not bad, kid!

508
00:31:56.212 --> 00:31:58.957
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but not bad.

509
00:32:01.125 --> 00:32:05.636
Oh, gee, miss, I'm really sorry.
That was dumb.

510
00:32:06.038 --> 00:32:07.748
Yeah.

511
00:32:08.755 --> 00:32:10.063
Excuse me.

512
00:32:14.986 --> 00:32:18.451
<i>Nice work! Excelente!</i>

513
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.535
Is Wonderboy here for real?

514
00:32:20.618 --> 00:32:23.364
What are you talkin' about?
Of course he's real.

515
00:32:23.454 --> 00:32:24.412
Whoa!

516
00:32:25.371 --> 00:32:29.883
And by the way, sweet cheeks,
I'm real, too.

517
00:32:30.045 --> 00:32:31.636
Ugh!

518
00:32:32.202 --> 00:32:34.468
Yee-hah! Yahoo!

519
00:32:40.271 --> 00:32:41.228
Whoa!

520
00:33:07.474 --> 00:33:09.468
- How was that, Phil?
- Rein it in, rookie.

521
00:33:09.551 --> 00:33:12.263
You can get away with mistakes
like those in the minor decathlons,

522
00:33:12.346 --> 00:33:14.853
but this is the big leagues!

523
00:33:14.943 --> 00:33:16.774
At least I beat him, didn't I?

524
00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.489
Next time, don't let your guard down
because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!

525
00:33:21.094 --> 00:33:25.127
It's like I keep tellin' ya.
You gotta stay focused, and... You...

526
00:33:34.716 --> 00:33:37.701
Are you all right, Miss...

527
00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:41.495
Megara. My friends call me Meg.
At least, they would if I had any friends.

528
00:33:41.586 --> 00:33:46.054
So did they give you a name
along with all those rippling pectorals?

529
00:33:46.139 --> 00:33:48.646
Uh, I'm, um, uh...

530
00:33:50.893 --> 00:33:52.441
Are you always this articulate?

531
00:33:52.532 --> 00:33:55.441
Hercules. My...
My name is Hercules.

532
00:33:55.966 --> 00:33:58.832
Hercules. I think I prefer Wonderboy.

533
00:33:59.641 --> 00:34:03.706
So, how'd you get mixed up with the...

534
00:34:03.796 --> 00:34:06.150
Pinhead with hooves?
Well, you know how men are.

535
00:34:06.232 --> 00:34:09.817
They think that "No" means "Yes," and
"Get lost" means "Take me, I'm yours."

536
00:34:12.223 --> 00:34:14.698
Don't worry.
Shorty here can explain it to ya later.

537
00:34:15.819 --> 00:34:20.450
Well, thanks for everything, Herc.
It's been a real slice.

538
00:34:20.932 --> 00:34:24.157
Wait! Can we give you a ride?

539
00:34:27.801 --> 00:34:30.547
I don't think
your pinto likes me very much.

540
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:35.390
Pegasus? Oh, no. Don't be silly.
He'd be more than happy to... Ow.

541
00:34:37.388 --> 00:34:42.934
I'll be all right. I'm a big, tough girl.
I tie my own sandals and everything.

542
00:34:44.459 --> 00:34:46.410
Bye-bye, Wonderboy.

543
00:34:46.816 --> 00:34:48.242
Bye.

544
00:34:49.332 --> 00:34:52.601
She's something. Isn't she, Phil?

545
00:34:52.687 --> 00:34:55.281
Yeah. Yeah. She's really something.

546
00:34:55.364 --> 00:34:56.758
A real pain in the patella!

547
00:34:56.842 --> 00:34:59.915
Earth to Herc!
Come in, Herc! Come in, Herc!

548
00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:02.710
We got a job to do, remember?

549
00:35:02.794 --> 00:35:04.460
Thebes is still waitin'.

550
00:35:04.551 --> 00:35:07.297
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

551
00:35:17.653 --> 00:35:19.679
Aw... How cute.

552
00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.277
A couple of rodents
looking for a theme park.

553
00:35:22.366 --> 00:35:25.679
Who you callin' a rodent, sister?
I'm a bunny!

554
00:35:25.762 --> 00:35:27.113
And I'm his gopher.

555
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.197
Ta-da!

556
00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:30.631
I thought I smelled a rat.

557
00:35:30.714 --> 00:35:32.350
Meg?

558
00:35:32.432 --> 00:35:34.187
Speak of the devil.

559
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:38.183
Meg, my little flower, my little bird,
my little nut, Meg.

560
00:35:38.265 --> 00:35:40.138
What exactly happened here?

561
00:35:40.221 --> 00:35:42.175
I thought you were gonna
persuade the river guardian

562
00:35:42.219 --> 00:35:43.734
to join my team for the uprising,

563
00:35:43.817 --> 00:35:46.487
and here I am,
kind of river guardian-less.

564
00:35:46.573 --> 00:35:50.441
I gave it my best shot,
but he made me an offer I had to refuse.

565
00:35:50.526 --> 00:35:53.034
Fine. So, instead of subtracting
two years from your sentence,

566
00:35:53.124 --> 00:35:54.791
hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?

567
00:35:54.881 --> 00:35:55.917
Give that your best shot.

568
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.909
It wasn't my fault.
It was this wonderboy, Hercules.

569
00:35:59.715 --> 00:36:03.344
Hercules?
Why does that name ring a bell?

570
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.142
I don't know.
Maybe we owe him money?

571
00:36:06.226 --> 00:36:10.617
- What was that name again?
- Hercules.

572
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.693
He comes on with
this big, innocent farm boy routine,

573
00:36:12.777 --> 00:36:14.472
but I could see through that
in a Peloponnesian minute.

574
00:36:14.494 --> 00:36:15.452
Wait a minute.

575
00:36:15.493 --> 00:36:18.565
Wasn't Hercules the name
of that kid we were supposed to...

576
00:36:18.648 --> 00:36:20.600
- Oh, my gods!
- Oh, my gods!

577
00:36:20.686 --> 00:36:21.993
Run for it!

578
00:36:22.084 --> 00:36:25.157
So you took care of him, huh?

579
00:36:25.239 --> 00:36:27.146
Dead as a door nail.

580
00:36:27.236 --> 00:36:29.950
Weren't those your exact words?

581
00:36:30.033 --> 00:36:31.820
This might be a different Hercules.

582
00:36:31.911 --> 00:36:35.418
Yeah! I mean, Hercules
is a very popular name nowadays!

583
00:36:35.505 --> 00:36:38.732
Remember, like, a few years ago,
every other boy was named Jason,

584
00:36:38.821 --> 00:36:40.456
and the girls were all named Brittany?

585
00:36:40.538 --> 00:36:44.886
I'm about to rearrange the cosmos,

586
00:36:44.972 --> 00:36:51.640
and the one schlemiel who can louse
it up is waltzing around in the woods!

587
00:36:55.597 --> 00:36:57.428
Wait. Wait, big guy.

588
00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:59.782
- We can still cut in on his waltzing.
- That's right!

589
00:36:59.871 --> 00:37:02.901
And at least we made him mortal.
That's a good thing.

590
00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:04.534
Didn't we?

591
00:37:04.744 --> 00:37:05.812
Hmm.

592
00:37:06.423 --> 00:37:07.893
Fortunately for the three of you,

593
00:37:07.981 --> 00:37:11.652
we still have time to correct
this rather egregious oversight.

594
00:37:11.734 --> 00:37:15.048
And this time, no foul-ups.

595
00:37:17.847 --> 00:37:18.804
Wow!

596
00:37:20.643 --> 00:37:23.956
- Is that all one town?
- One town, a million troubles.

597
00:37:24.038 --> 00:37:28.102
The one and only Thebes.
The Big Olive itself.

598
00:37:28.192 --> 00:37:31.265
If you can make it there,
you can make it anywhere.

599
00:37:38.258 --> 00:37:42.171
Stick with me, kid.
This city is a dangerous place.

600
00:37:42.252 --> 00:37:46.078
- Look where you're goin', numbskull!
- Hey, I'm walkin' here!

601
00:37:46.167 --> 00:37:48.641
You see what I mean?
I'm tellin' you, wackos.

602
00:37:48.724 --> 00:37:51.917
Pitta bread. Pitta bread.
Get your pitta bread here.

603
00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:53.514
Hey, Mack.

604
00:37:53.597 --> 00:37:54.633
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

605
00:37:54.875 --> 00:37:57.740
- You wanna buy a sundial?
- He's not interested, all right?

606
00:37:57.832 --> 00:37:58.822
Come on, kid.

607
00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:01.896
The end is coming! Can't you feel it?

608
00:38:01.986 --> 00:38:06.049
Yes, yes. Thank you for the info. Yes.
We'll ponder that for a while.

609
00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.434
Just stare at the sidewalk. Come on.

610
00:38:07.457 --> 00:38:09.811
Don't make eye contact.
People here are nuts.

611
00:38:09.895 --> 00:38:11.966
That's because
they live in a city of turmoil.

612
00:38:12.052 --> 00:38:13.043
Trust me, kid.

613
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.320
You're gonna be
just what the doctor ordered.

614
00:38:16.285 --> 00:38:20.393
It was tragic!
We lost everything in the fire.

615
00:38:20.479 --> 00:38:23.389
Everything except old Snowball here.

616
00:38:24.554 --> 00:38:27.299
Now, were the fires
before or after the earthquake?

617
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.461
They were after the earthquake.
I remember.

618
00:38:29.547 --> 00:38:30.899
But before the flood.

619
00:38:30.986 --> 00:38:34.254
Don't even get me started
on the crime rate.

620
00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.773
Thebes has certainly
gone downhill in a hurry.

621
00:38:37.855 --> 00:38:39.370
Tell me about it.

622
00:38:39.454 --> 00:38:41.404
It seems like every time I turn around,

623
00:38:41.491 --> 00:38:43.681
there's some new monster
wreaking havoc and I...

624
00:38:43.767 --> 00:38:47.200
All we need now is a plague of locusts.

625
00:38:48.921 --> 00:38:51.994
That's it! I'm movin' to Sparta!

626
00:38:52.076 --> 00:38:53.263
Excuse me.

627
00:38:54.352 --> 00:38:56.260
It, uh...

628
00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.738
...seems to me that what
you folks need is a hero.

629
00:39:01.064 --> 00:39:02.893
Yeah, and who are you?

630
00:39:04.858 --> 00:39:09.326
I'm Hercules, and I happen to be a hero.

631
00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.877
- Is that so?
- A hero!

632
00:39:12.966 --> 00:39:17.315
- Have you ever saved a town before?
- Uh, no. Not exactly, but I...

633
00:39:17.401 --> 00:39:19.787
Have you ever
reversed a natural disaster?

634
00:39:19.878 --> 00:39:22.187
Well, uh, no.

635
00:39:22.274 --> 00:39:25.261
Listen to this.
He's just another chariot chaser.

636
00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.421
- This we need.
- That's a laugh.

637
00:39:27.507 --> 00:39:29.740
- Don't you pea brains get it?
- Hmm?

638
00:39:29.863 --> 00:39:32.010
This kid is the genuine article.

639
00:39:32.219 --> 00:39:35.925
Hey, isn't that the goat-man
who trained Achilles?

640
00:39:36.015 --> 00:39:37.606
Watch it, pal.

641
00:39:37.693 --> 00:39:39.839
Yeah, you're right.

642
00:39:39.929 --> 00:39:42.316
Hey, nice job on those heels!

643
00:39:42.406 --> 00:39:44.880
Ya missed a spot!

644
00:39:44.963 --> 00:39:46.869
I got your heel right here!

645
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.986
I'll wipe that stupid grin
off your face! You...

646
00:39:49.076 --> 00:39:52.226
Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil! Take it easy. Phil.

647
00:39:52.313 --> 00:39:54.700
What are you, crazy? Sheesh!

648
00:39:54.869 --> 00:40:00.012
Young man, we need
a professional hero, not an amateur.

649
00:40:01.381 --> 00:40:03.407
Well, wait. Stop!

650
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:12.195
How am I supposed to prove myself
a hero if nobody will give me a chance?

651
00:40:12.285 --> 00:40:13.353
You'll get your chance.

652
00:40:13.443 --> 00:40:16.308
You just need some kind of
catastrophe or disaster.

653
00:40:16.399 --> 00:40:18.034
Please.

654
00:40:18.156 --> 00:40:21.230
Help! Please!
There's been a terrible accident!

655
00:40:21.313 --> 00:40:23.383
- Meg?
- Speakin' of disasters.

656
00:40:23.789 --> 00:40:26.938
Wonderboy! Hercules!
Thank goodness!

657
00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:28.418
What's wrong?

658
00:40:28.502 --> 00:40:31.696
Outside of town, two little boys.
They were playing in the gorge.

659
00:40:31.778 --> 00:40:34.328
There was this terrible rockslide.

660
00:40:34.414 --> 00:40:37.040
- They're trapped!
- Kids? Trapped?

661
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:38.646
Phil, this is great!

662
00:40:38.729 --> 00:40:40.453
You're really choked up about this,
aren't ya?

663
00:40:40.526 --> 00:40:41.484
Come on!

664
00:40:41.524 --> 00:40:46.068
No, I... You don't...
I have this terrible fear of heights!

665
00:40:50.711 --> 00:40:53.381
I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo!

666
00:40:53.468 --> 00:40:55.298
I'm way behind ya, kid.

667
00:40:55.384 --> 00:40:57.531
I got a fur wedgie.

668
00:41:04.292 --> 00:41:06.003
- Are you okay?
- I'll be fine.

669
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.205
Just get me down
before I ruin the upholstery.

670
00:41:08.288 --> 00:41:11.197
- Help! I can't breathe!
- Hurry!

671
00:41:11.283 --> 00:41:13.637
- Get us out!
- We're suffocating!

672
00:41:14.718 --> 00:41:17.824
Somebody call IX-I-I!

673
00:41:17.914 --> 00:41:19.462
Easy, fellas. You'll be all right.

674
00:41:19.552 --> 00:41:23.856
- We can't last much longer!
- Get us out before we get crushed!

675
00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.034
- How you boys doin'?
- We're okay now.

676
00:41:44.117 --> 00:41:47.582
Jeepers, mister. You're really strong.

677
00:41:47.672 --> 00:41:51.018
Well, try to be a little more careful
next time, okay, kids?

678
00:41:51.107 --> 00:41:52.698
We sure will.

679
00:41:57.938 --> 00:41:59.812
A stirring performance, boys.

680
00:41:59.896 --> 00:42:01.651
I was really moved.

681
00:42:02.892 --> 00:42:05.081
"Jeepers, mister"?

682
00:42:05.168 --> 00:42:08.242
I was going for innocence.

683
00:42:08.324 --> 00:42:12.357
And, hey, two thumbs
way, way up for our leading lady.

684
00:42:12.439 --> 00:42:14.074
What a dish. What a doll.

685
00:42:14.156 --> 00:42:16.749
Get outta there, you big lug,
white you still can.

686
00:42:17.072 --> 00:42:19.142
Phil, I did great.

687
00:42:19.468 --> 00:42:21.463
They even applauded, sort of.

688
00:42:21.826 --> 00:42:23.416
Huh!

689
00:42:23.504 --> 00:42:26.935
I hate to burst your bubble, kid,
but that ain't applause.

690
00:42:34.088 --> 00:42:36.758
Phil? What do you call that thing?

691
00:42:36.844 --> 00:42:37.999
Two words.

692
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:41.031
Am-scray!

693
00:42:43.795 --> 00:42:47.980
Let's get ready to rumble!

694
00:42:53.941 --> 00:42:56.447
That's it. Dance around! Dance around!

695
00:42:56.537 --> 00:42:59.524
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.
Keep going. Come on. Come on.

696
00:42:59.613 --> 00:43:02.925
Lead with your left.
Lead with your left! Your other left!

697
00:43:27.774 --> 00:43:30.281
Whoa!

698
00:43:54.497 --> 00:43:57.809
All right! All right! You're bad! Okay!

699
00:43:57.892 --> 00:44:01.402
See, Phil? That... That wasn't so hard.

700
00:44:01.488 --> 00:44:03.122
Kid, kid, kid.

701
00:44:03.205 --> 00:44:04.632
How many horns do ya see?

702
00:44:04.723 --> 00:44:06.390
Six?

703
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.226
Eh, close enough.
Let's get you cleaned up.

704
00:44:13.151 --> 00:44:16.017
Guys, guys, relax.

705
00:44:16.107 --> 00:44:17.894
It's only half-time.

706
00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:22.776
That doesn't sound good.

707
00:44:30.088 --> 00:44:31.636
Definitely not good!

708
00:44:42.351 --> 00:44:43.342
Whoa! Whoa!

709
00:44:59.248 --> 00:45:02.038
Will you forget the head-slicing thing?

710
00:45:02.203 --> 00:45:03.239
Hyah!

711
00:45:09.313 --> 00:45:12.746
Phil, I don't think we covered
this one in basic training!

712
00:45:23.533 --> 00:45:26.083
My favorite part of the game,

713
00:45:29.125 --> 00:45:30.879
Sudden death.

714
00:45:37.275 --> 00:45:38.232
Huh?

715
00:45:51.016 --> 00:45:52.170
Oh!

716
00:45:52.853 --> 00:45:56.557
There goes another one.
Just like Achilles.

717
00:45:59.044 --> 00:46:00.831
Game.

718
00:46:00.921 --> 00:46:02.676
Set.

719
00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:04.067
Match.

720
00:46:26.846 --> 00:46:31.717
Phil, you gotta admit.
That was pretty heroic.

721
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:36.147
Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!
You won by a landslide!

722
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:40.664
Hades mad.

723
00:46:43.263 --> 00:46:45.933
Well, what do ya know?

724
00:46:49.814 --> 00:46:53.606
From that day forward,
our boy Hercules could do no wrong.

725
00:46:53.689 --> 00:46:56.957
He was so hot, steam looked cool.

726
00:46:57.044 --> 00:46:59.190
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

727
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.952
<i>Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll</i>

728
00:47:03.035 --> 00:47:05.868
<i>Person of the week
in every Greek opinion poll</i>

729
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:08.458
<i>- What a pro
- Herc could stop a show</i>

730
00:47:08.548 --> 00:47:11.413
<i>Point him at a monster
and you're talkin' SRO</i>

731
00:47:11.504 --> 00:47:14.174
<i>- He was a no one
- A zero, zero</i>

732
00:47:14.261 --> 00:47:16.974
<i>- Now he's a honcho
- He's a hero</i>

733
00:47:17.096 --> 00:47:19.766
<i>Here was a kid with his act down pat</i>

734
00:47:19.852 --> 00:47:22.598
<i>Zero to hero in no time flat</i>

735
00:47:22.688 --> 00:47:25.359
<i>- Zero to hero
- Just like that</i>

736
00:47:25.445 --> 00:47:27.831
<i>When he smiled the girls went wild</i>

737
00:47:27.962 --> 00:47:30.631
<i>With oohs and aahs</i>

738
00:47:30.717 --> 00:47:33.343
<i>And they slapped his face
on every vase</i>

739
00:47:33.433 --> 00:47:36.627
<i>On every "vahse"</i>

740
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:39.019
<i>From appearance fees and royalties</i>

741
00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:41.579
<i>Our Herc had cash to burn</i>

742
00:47:41.662 --> 00:47:44.289
<i>Now nouveau riche and famous</i>

743
00:47:44.379 --> 00:47:47.571
<i>He could tell you what's a Grecian urn</i>

744
00:47:47.814 --> 00:47:50.407
<i>Say amen, there he goes again</i>

745
00:47:50.489 --> 00:47:53.236
<i>- Sweet and undefeated
- And an awesome 10-for-10</i>

746
00:47:53.366 --> 00:47:55.795
<i>Folks lined up just to watch him flex</i>

747
00:47:55.883 --> 00:47:58.912
<i>And this perfect package
packed a pair of pretty pecs</i>

748
00:47:58.998 --> 00:48:01.624
<i>Hercie, he comes
he sees, he conquers</i>

749
00:48:01.714 --> 00:48:04.504
<i>Honey, the crowds were goin' bonkers</i>

750
00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:06.420
<i>He showed the moxie
brains and spunk</i>

751
00:48:06.507 --> 00:48:07.465
<i>Yeah</i>

752
00:48:07.547 --> 00:48:09.900
<i>- From zero to hero
- A major hunk</i>

753
00:48:09.982 --> 00:48:12.577
<i>- Zero to hero
- And who'd have thunk?</i>

754
00:48:15.975 --> 00:48:18.165
<i>Who put the glad in gladiator?</i>

755
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:19.559
<i>Hercules</i>

756
00:48:19.649 --> 00:48:21.917
<i>Who's darin' deeds are great theater?</i>

757
00:48:22.007 --> 00:48:23.554
<i>Hercules</i>

758
00:48:23.644 --> 00:48:25.474
<i>- isn't he bold?
- No one braver</i>

759
00:48:25.561 --> 00:48:27.512
<i>- Is he sweet?
- Our favorite flavour</i>

760
00:48:27.598 --> 00:48:28.589
<i>Hercules</i>

761
00:48:28.677 --> 00:48:29.635
My man.

762
00:48:29.716 --> 00:48:31.503
<i>- Hercules
- Hercules</i>

763
00:48:31.593 --> 00:48:33.500
<i>Hercules</i>

764
00:48:33.591 --> 00:48:35.465
<i>- Hercules
- Look at my Hercules</i>

765
00:48:35.547 --> 00:48:38.860
<i>- Hercules Hercules
- Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

766
00:48:38.943 --> 00:48:41.176
<i>Bless my soul, Herc was on a roll</i>

767
00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.734
<i>- Undefeated
- Riding high</i>

768
00:48:43.816 --> 00:48:45.123
And the nicest guy.

769
00:48:45.215 --> 00:48:46.849
<i>Not conceited</i>

770
00:48:46.931 --> 00:48:48.807
<i>- He was a nothing
- Zero, zero</i>

771
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:50.763
<i>- Now he's a honcho
- He's our hero</i>

772
00:48:50.847 --> 00:48:53.833
<i>He hit the heights at breakneck speed</i>

773
00:48:53.922 --> 00:48:56.068
<i>From zero to hero</i>

774
00:48:56.159 --> 00:48:57.915
<i>Herc is a hero</i>

775
00:48:57.997 --> 00:49:02.180
<i>Now he's a hero</i>

776
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:04.943
<i>Yes, indeed</i>

777
00:49:07.624 --> 00:49:08.931
Pull!

778
00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:14.523
Nice shootin', Rex.

779
00:49:14.613 --> 00:49:16.085
I can't believe this guy.

780
00:49:16.172 --> 00:49:18.678
I throw everything I've got at him
and it doesn't even...

781
00:49:20.326 --> 00:49:23.670
What are those?

782
00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:27.666
Um, I don't know.
I thought they looked kinda dashing.

783
00:49:27.796 --> 00:49:31.380
I've got 24 hours to get rid of this bozo,

784
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:36.854
or the entire scheme I've been setting
up for 18 years goes up in smoke,

785
00:49:37.263 --> 00:49:42.046
and you are wearing his merchandise!

786
00:49:49.046 --> 00:49:50.081
Thirsty?

787
00:50:00.869 --> 00:50:02.177
Looks like your game's over.

788
00:50:02.268 --> 00:50:04.894
Wonderboy is hitting
every curve you throw at him.

789
00:50:05.783 --> 00:50:09.095
Oh, yeah.

790
00:50:09.418 --> 00:50:11.084
I wonder if maybe

791
00:50:11.176 --> 00:50:17.201
I haven't been throwing
the right curves at him, Meg, my sweet.

792
00:50:17.646 --> 00:50:19.357
Don't even go there.

793
00:50:19.444 --> 00:50:23.793
See, he's gotta have a weakness
because everybody's got a weakness.

794
00:50:23.878 --> 00:50:26.231
I mean, for what?
Pandora, it was the box thing.

795
00:50:26.313 --> 00:50:28.863
For the Trojans, hey.
They bet on the wrong horse, okay?

796
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:31.696
We simply need to
find out Wonderboy's.

797
00:50:31.787 --> 00:50:33.857
I've done my part. Get your little imps...

798
00:50:33.944 --> 00:50:35.119
They couldn't handle him as a baby.

799
00:50:35.142 --> 00:50:38.367
I need somebody
who can handle him as a man.

800
00:50:38.457 --> 00:50:40.365
Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.

801
00:50:40.455 --> 00:50:44.279
That's good because that's what
got you into this jam in the first place.

802
00:50:44.369 --> 00:50:47.637
You sold your soul to me
to save your boyfriend's life.

803
00:50:47.724 --> 00:50:50.198
And how does this creep thank you?

804
00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.233
By running off with some babe.

805
00:50:53.317 --> 00:50:55.310
He hurt you real bad,
didn't he, Meg, huh?

806
00:50:55.394 --> 00:50:57.268
Look, I learned my lesson, okay?

807
00:50:57.351 --> 00:51:01.699
Which is exactly why I got a feelin'
you're gonna leap at my new offer.

808
00:51:01.784 --> 00:51:04.694
You give me the key
to bringing down Wonder Breath,

809
00:51:04.781 --> 00:51:10.524
and I give you the thing that
you crave most in the entire cosmos,

810
00:51:10.972 --> 00:51:12.802
your freedom.

811
00:51:16.805 --> 00:51:18.319
You should have been there, Father.

812
00:51:18.402 --> 00:51:23.425
I mangled the Minotaur,
grappled with the Gorgon.

813
00:51:23.515 --> 00:51:24.702
Just like Phil told me.

814
00:51:24.792 --> 00:51:28.465
I analyzed the situation,
controlled my strength and kicked.

815
00:51:30.465 --> 00:51:32.579
The crowds went wild!

816
00:51:34.859 --> 00:51:36.211
Thank you. Thank you.

817
00:51:36.337 --> 00:51:37.295
Hah!

818
00:51:37.535 --> 00:51:41.326
You're doin' great, son.
You're doing your old man proud.

819
00:51:41.409 --> 00:51:43.524
I'm glad to hear you say that, Father.

820
00:51:43.608 --> 00:51:45.481
I've been waiting for this day
a long time.

821
00:51:45.565 --> 00:51:48.038
Hmm. What day is that, son?

822
00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:51.030
The day I rejoin the gods.

823
00:51:51.116 --> 00:51:54.865
You've done wonderfully.
You really have, my boy.

824
00:51:54.951 --> 00:51:56.705
You're just not there yet.

825
00:51:56.789 --> 00:52:00.657
You haven't proven yourself a true hero.

826
00:52:00.743 --> 00:52:04.012
But, Father, I've beaten every single
monster I've come up against.

827
00:52:04.098 --> 00:52:07.204
I'm the most famous person
in all of Greece.

828
00:52:07.294 --> 00:52:10.998
I'm an action figure!

829
00:52:11.088 --> 00:52:16.472
I'm afraid being famous
isn't the same as being a true hero.

830
00:52:16.561 --> 00:52:18.228
What more can I do?

831
00:52:18.319 --> 00:52:21.665
It's something
you have to discover for yourself.

832
00:52:21.755 --> 00:52:25.819
- But how can I...
- Look inside your heart.

833
00:52:27.027 --> 00:52:29.097
Father, wait!

834
00:52:44.282 --> 00:52:46.549
<i>On your left is Hercules' villa.</i>

835
00:52:46.639 --> 00:52:48.874
<i>Our next stop is
the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop</i>

836
00:52:48.957 --> 00:52:49.915
<i>where you can pick up</i>

837
00:52:49.995 --> 00:52:53.787
<i>the great hero's 30-minute
workout scroll Buns of Bronze.</i>

838
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.102
At 1:00,
you got a meeting with King Augeas.

839
00:52:56.186 --> 00:52:57.854
He's got a problem with his stables.

840
00:52:57.944 --> 00:52:59.611
I'd advise you
not to wear your new sandals.

841
00:52:59.702 --> 00:53:01.934
- Phil?
- I told you, don't move!

842
00:53:02.019 --> 00:53:03.673
DGR, the Daughters of
the Greek Revolution.

843
00:53:03.695 --> 00:53:04.653
- Phil.
- At 3:00,

844
00:53:04.735 --> 00:53:06.641
you gotta get a girdle
from some Amazons.

845
00:53:06.731 --> 00:53:09.641
Phil, what's the point?

846
00:53:11.685 --> 00:53:12.916
That's it!

847
00:53:13.003 --> 00:53:14.833
Keep your toga on, pal.

848
00:53:16.958 --> 00:53:17.915
Yuck!

849
00:53:18.317 --> 00:53:20.027
What do you mean, "What's the point?"

850
00:53:20.113 --> 00:53:21.780
You wanna go to Olympus, don't ya?

851
00:53:21.871 --> 00:53:25.784
Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem
to be getting me anywhere.

852
00:53:25.865 --> 00:53:28.339
You can't give up now.
I'm countin' on ya.

853
00:53:28.422 --> 00:53:30.612
I gave this everything I had.

854
00:53:32.816 --> 00:53:35.562
Listen to me, kid. I seen 'em all.

855
00:53:35.652 --> 00:53:39.684
And I am tellin' you,
and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth,

856
00:53:39.766 --> 00:53:42.631
- you got somethin' I never seen before.
- Really?

857
00:53:42.721 --> 00:53:46.231
I can feel it right down
to these stubby bowlegs of mine.

858
00:53:46.318 --> 00:53:49.030
There is nothin' you can't do, kid.

859
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:51.628
It's him!

860
00:53:52.269 --> 00:53:53.544
Hey, watch it! Watch it! Watch...

861
00:53:53.627 --> 00:53:57.211
- I touched his elbow!
- I got his sweatband!

862
00:53:57.302 --> 00:53:59.448
Phil, help!

863
00:53:59.539 --> 00:54:01.925
- Okay. Escape plan, beta.
- Gotcha.

864
00:54:02.055 --> 00:54:04.323
Hey. Where is he?

865
00:54:04.412 --> 00:54:06.003
There he goes! On the veranda!

866
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:07.397
Whoa!

867
00:54:22.507 --> 00:54:23.465
Let's see.

868
00:54:23.546 --> 00:54:25.900
What could be behind
curtain number one?

869
00:54:25.982 --> 00:54:26.972
Meg!

870
00:54:27.061 --> 00:54:30.254
It's all right.
The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.

871
00:54:30.337 --> 00:54:33.246
Gee, it's great to see you.

872
00:54:33.332 --> 00:54:34.880
I missed you.

873
00:54:34.969 --> 00:54:37.323
So this is what heroes do
on their days off.

874
00:54:37.406 --> 00:54:39.553
I'm no hero.

875
00:54:39.644 --> 00:54:41.877
Sure ya are. Everybody in Greece

876
00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.333
thinks you're the greatest thing
since they put the pocket in pitta.

877
00:54:44.356 --> 00:54:46.982
I know. It's crazy.

878
00:54:47.072 --> 00:54:48.808
You know, I can't go anywhere
without being mobbed.

879
00:54:48.831 --> 00:54:50.978
- I mean...
- You sound like you could use a break.

880
00:54:51.067 --> 00:54:53.334
Think your nanny goat would go...

881
00:54:53.424 --> 00:54:55.778
...berserk if you played hooky
this afternoon?

882
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.287
Oh, gee. I don't know.

883
00:54:57.378 --> 00:54:59.034
Phil's got the rest of the day
pretty much booked.

884
00:54:59.057 --> 00:55:01.890
Ah, Phil, schmill. Just follow me.

885
00:55:01.973 --> 00:55:06.080
Out the window, round the dumbbells,
you lift up the back wall and we're gone.

886
00:55:11.239 --> 00:55:13.352
Wow. What a day.

887
00:55:13.436 --> 00:55:18.666
First, that restaurant by the bay,
and then that play, that Oedipus thing.

888
00:55:18.749 --> 00:55:21.179
Man! I thought I had problems.

889
00:55:23.661 --> 00:55:28.489
- Psst! Stop foolin' around!
- Yeah. Get the goods, sister.

890
00:55:28.575 --> 00:55:31.920
I didn't know that
playing hooky could be so much fun.

891
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:35.596
- Yeah. Neither did I.
- Thanks, Meg.

892
00:55:36.206 --> 00:55:37.393
Oh.

893
00:55:37.882 --> 00:55:39.473
Don't thank me just yet.

894
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.917
Oh!

895
00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:42.389
Oop. Careful.

896
00:55:42.476 --> 00:55:44.471
Sorry. Weak ankles.

897
00:55:44.554 --> 00:55:47.822
Oh, yeah? Well,
maybe you better sit down for a while.

898
00:55:49.067 --> 00:55:54.058
So, uh, do you have any problems
with things like this?

899
00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:55.737
Uh...

900
00:55:55.938 --> 00:55:57.486
Weak ankles, I mean.

901
00:55:57.575 --> 00:56:00.169
Oh, no. Not really.

902
00:56:00.451 --> 00:56:04.123
No weaknesses whatsoever?

903
00:56:04.206 --> 00:56:06.199
No trick knee?

904
00:56:06.843 --> 00:56:09.391
Ruptured disks?

905
00:56:11.475 --> 00:56:15.267
No. I'm afraid I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle.

906
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:18.300
Wonderboy, you are perfect.

907
00:56:18.426 --> 00:56:20.693
Thanks.

908
00:56:21.223 --> 00:56:23.097
Whoops!

909
00:56:25.417 --> 00:56:27.487
It looks better that way.

910
00:56:27.574 --> 00:56:29.807
No, it really does.

911
00:56:35.961 --> 00:56:38.511
You know, when I was a kid,

912
00:56:38.598 --> 00:56:41.944
I would have given anything
to be exactly like everybody else.

913
00:56:42.034 --> 00:56:45.107
You wanted to be
petty and dishonest?

914
00:56:45.189 --> 00:56:46.301
Everybody's not like that.

915
00:56:47.066 --> 00:56:48.897
Yes, they are.

916
00:56:48.984 --> 00:56:50.694
You're not like that.

917
00:56:50.781 --> 00:56:52.372
How do you know what I'm like?

918
00:56:52.459 --> 00:56:59.161
All I know is you're the most amazing
person with weak ankles I've ever met.

919
00:57:02.366 --> 00:57:03.433
Oh!

920
00:57:04.082 --> 00:57:09.749
Meg, when I'm with you,
I don't feel so alone.

921
00:57:10.954 --> 00:57:13.340
Sometimes it's better to be alone.

922
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:14.617
What do you mean?

923
00:57:14.707 --> 00:57:16.702
Nobody can hurt you.

924
00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.452
Meg?

925
00:57:21.898 --> 00:57:25.286
I would never, ever hurt you.

926
00:57:25.374 --> 00:57:31.323
And I don't wanna hurt you, so let's both
do ourselves a favour and stop this

927
00:57:32.724 --> 00:57:34.869
before we...

928
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.992
<i>All right! Break it up! Break it up!
Party's over!</i>

929
00:57:39.075 --> 00:57:41.788
<i>- I been lookin' all over this town!
- Calm down, mutton man.</i>

930
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:43.102
It was all my fault.

931
00:57:43.188 --> 00:57:45.815
<i>You're already on my list, sister,
so don't make it worse!</i>

932
00:57:48.781 --> 00:57:51.375
And as for you, ya bum,
you're gonna go to the stadium

933
00:57:51.457 --> 00:57:53.393
and you're gonna be put through
the workout of your life!

934
00:57:53.416 --> 00:57:56.564
- Now get on the horse.
- Okay, okay.

935
00:57:57.848 --> 00:58:00.354
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, he'll get over it.

936
00:58:05.838 --> 00:58:08.790
Move!
Move, move, move, move, move! Move!

937
00:58:09.113 --> 00:58:10.779
Whoo! Yahee!

938
00:58:14.266 --> 00:58:18.331
Hey, watch it, watch it! Watch it!
Keep your goo-goo eyes on the...

939
00:58:21.016 --> 00:58:24.449
That's it. Next time, I drive.

940
00:58:31.803 --> 00:58:34.711
Oh, what's the matter with me?

941
00:58:34.798 --> 00:58:37.511
You'd think a girl would learn.

942
00:58:38.392 --> 00:58:42.457
<i>If there's a prize for rotten judgment</i>

943
00:58:42.666 --> 00:58:46.251
<i>I guess I've already won that</i>

944
00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:50.729
<i>No man is worth the aggravation</i>

945
00:58:50.816 --> 00:58:54.607
<i>That's ancient history
Been there, done that</i>

946
00:58:54.689 --> 00:58:58.362
<i>Who d'ya think you're kidding
He's the Earth and heaven to you</i>

947
00:58:58.445 --> 00:59:02.149
<i>Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through you</i>

948
00:59:02.239 --> 00:59:03.906
<i>- Oh no
- Girl, you can't conceal it</i>

949
00:59:03.997 --> 00:59:08.660
<i>We know how you feel
and who you're thinkin' of</i>

950
00:59:10.269 --> 00:59:14.017
<i>No chance no way
I won't say it, no, no</i>

951
00:59:14.103 --> 00:59:17.656
<i>You swoon you sigh
Why deny it? Uh-oh</i>

952
00:59:17.738 --> 00:59:22.009
<i>It's too cliché, I won't say I'm in love</i>

953
00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:25.005
<i>Shoo-doo shoo-doo
Oooooo</i>

954
00:59:25.087 --> 00:59:28.596
<i>I thought my heart
had learned its lesson</i>

955
00:59:28.682 --> 00:59:32.071
<i>It feels so good when you start out</i>

956
00:59:32.437 --> 00:59:35.947
<i>My head is screaming
"Get a grip, girl"</i>

957
00:59:36.392 --> 00:59:40.064
<i>Unless you're dyin'
To cry your heart out</i>

958
00:59:40.146 --> 00:59:43.895
<i>You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feelin'</i>

959
00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.686
<i>Baby, we're not buyin'
Hon, we saw you hit the ceilin'</i>

960
00:59:47.777 --> 00:59:51.481
<i>Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up that you</i>

961
00:59:51.571 --> 00:59:54.916
<i>- Got
- Got it bad?</i>

962
00:59:55.006 --> 00:59:59.474
<i>Oh, no chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no</i>

963
00:59:59.599 --> 01:00:03.228
<i>- Give up, but give in
- Check the grin, you're in love</i>

964
01:00:03.315 --> 01:00:07.019
<i>This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love</i>

965
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:09.735
<i>You're doing flips
Read our lips</i>

966
01:00:09.826 --> 01:00:10.783
<i>You're in love</i>

967
01:00:10.863 --> 01:00:13.218
<i>You're way off base
I won't say I'm it</i>

968
01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:14.533
<i>She won't say in love</i>

969
01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:18.444
<i>Get off my case, I won't say it</i>

970
01:00:18.533 --> 01:00:22.763
<i>Girl, don't be proud
It's okay, you're in love</i>

971
01:00:23.647 --> 01:00:25.477
<i>Oh</i>

972
01:00:26.243 --> 01:00:29.556
<i>At least out loud</i>

973
01:00:29.638 --> 01:00:32.352
<i>I won't say I'm in</i>

974
01:00:33.193 --> 01:00:36.658
<i>- Love
- Shoo-doo, shoo-doo</i>

975
01:00:36.828 --> 01:00:39.215
<i>Sha-la-la-la-Ia-la-la-la</i>

976
01:00:39.504 --> 01:00:40.780
<i>Ah</i>

977
01:00:50.889 --> 01:00:53.319
Hey, what's the buzz, huh, Meg?

978
01:00:53.405 --> 01:00:56.674
What is the weak link
in Wonderboy's chain?

979
01:00:56.761 --> 01:00:58.951
Get yourself another girl. I'm through.

980
01:00:59.037 --> 01:01:00.812
I'm sorry. Do you mind
runnin' that by me again?

981
01:01:00.834 --> 01:01:03.384
I must have had a chunk of brimstone
wedged in my ear or something.

982
01:01:03.471 --> 01:01:07.416
Then read my lips! Forget it.

983
01:01:07.506 --> 01:01:11.810
Meg, Meg, Meg,
my sweet, deluded little minion.

984
01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:16.487
Aren't we forgetting one teensy-weensy,
but ever so crucial little, tiny detail?

985
01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:18.447
I own you!

986
01:01:20.369 --> 01:01:22.961
- I got another horn here.
- You work for me.

987
01:01:23.044 --> 01:01:25.310
That kid's gonna be
doin' laps for a month.

988
01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:28.507
If I say, "Sing," you say,
"Hey, name that tune."

989
01:01:28.598 --> 01:01:32.901
If I say, "I want Wonderboy's head
on a platter," you say...

990
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:34.817
Medium or well-done.

991
01:01:34.908 --> 01:01:39.300
Oh! I knew that dame was trouble.
This is gonna break the kid's heart.

992
01:01:39.461 --> 01:01:42.413
- I'll work on that.
- I'm sorry. You hear that sound?

993
01:01:42.497 --> 01:01:46.606
That's the sound of your freedom
fluttering out the window forever.

994
01:01:46.691 --> 01:01:49.917
I don't care.
I'm not gonna help you hurt him.

995
01:01:50.965 --> 01:01:54.791
I can't believe you're
getting so worked up about some guy.

996
01:01:54.881 --> 01:01:57.027
This one is different.
He's honest, and he's sweet...

997
01:01:57.117 --> 01:01:58.074
Please!

998
01:01:58.156 --> 01:01:59.891
- He would never do anything to hurt me.
- He's a guy!

999
01:01:59.913 --> 01:02:03.945
Besides, O oneness,
you can't beat him.

1000
01:02:04.028 --> 01:02:07.656
He has no weaknesses. He's gonna...

1001
01:02:08.061 --> 01:02:11.645
I think he does, Meg.

1002
01:02:11.737 --> 01:02:14.930
I truly think he does.

1003
01:02:25.877 --> 01:02:26.944
Ha ha!

1004
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.546
Whoo-hoo!

1005
01:02:37.061 --> 01:02:39.328
Hey, Phil! What happened to you?

1006
01:02:39.417 --> 01:02:40.770
Kid, we gotta talk.

1007
01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:44.365
Phil, I just had
the greatest day of my life!

1008
01:02:44.451 --> 01:02:46.685
I can't stop thinking about Meg.

1009
01:02:46.848 --> 01:02:48.961
She's something else.

1010
01:02:49.125 --> 01:02:52.232
Kid, I'm tr yin' to talk to ya!
Will you come down here and listen?

1011
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.952
Aw, how can I come down there
when I'm feeling so up?

1012
01:03:21.161 --> 01:03:22.588
Gotcha!

1013
01:03:22.679 --> 01:03:24.912
Ah, very nice!
What I'm tr yin' to say is...

1014
01:03:24.995 --> 01:03:27.426
That if it wasn't for you,
I never would have met her.

1015
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:29.266
Oh, I owe ya big time.

1016
01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:31.083
Will you just knock it off
for a couple of seconds?

1017
01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:33.613
Rule number 38. Come on, Phil.
Keep them up there, huh?

1018
01:03:33.702 --> 01:03:36.656
- Phil, I got two words for ya, duck!
- Listen to me! She's...

1019
01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.090
- A dream come true?
- Not exactly.

1020
01:03:38.176 --> 01:03:40.203
- More beautiful than Aphrodite?
- Aside from that!

1021
01:03:40.294 --> 01:03:44.325
- The most wonderful...
- She's a fraud!

1022
01:03:44.408 --> 01:03:46.882
She's been playin' ya for a sap!

1023
01:03:46.965 --> 01:03:49.874
- Aw, come on. Stop kiddin' around.
- I'm not kiddin' around.

1024
01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.655
I know you're upset about today,
but that's no reason to...

1025
01:03:51.678 --> 01:03:52.734
Kid, you're missin' the point.

1026
01:03:52.757 --> 01:03:55.067
- The point is, I love her.
- She don't love you.

1027
01:03:55.153 --> 01:03:57.267
- You're crazy.
- She's nothin' but a two-timin'...

1028
01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:59.344
- Stop it!
- No-good, lyin', schemin'...

1029
01:03:59.427 --> 01:04:00.702
Shut up!

1030
01:04:03.903 --> 01:04:05.657
Phil. I...

1031
01:04:06.657 --> 01:04:07.648
I'm sorry.

1032
01:04:07.737 --> 01:04:11.484
Okay, okay, that's it.
You won't face the truth? Fine.

1033
01:04:11.571 --> 01:04:13.958
Phil, wait. Where you going?

1034
01:04:14.087 --> 01:04:17.399
I'm hoppin' the first barge out of here.
I'm goin' home.

1035
01:04:18.122 --> 01:04:20.116
Fine!

1036
01:04:20.199 --> 01:04:23.065
Go! I don't... I don't need you.

1037
01:04:25.351 --> 01:04:28.458
I thought you were gonna be
the all-time champ,

1038
01:04:28.547 --> 01:04:30.934
not the all-time chump.

1039
01:04:33.701 --> 01:04:36.326
Geez Louise!
What got his goat, huh?

1040
01:04:39.053 --> 01:04:41.080
Baboom. Name is Hades,
Lord of the Dead.

1041
01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:43.120
- Hi. How ya doin'?
- Not now, okay?

1042
01:04:43.208 --> 01:04:45.813
Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds
and I'm a fast talker, all right?

1043
01:04:45.843 --> 01:04:48.601
I've got the major deal in the works.
A real estate venture, if you will.

1044
01:04:48.639 --> 01:04:50.634
And Herc, you little devil you.
May I call you Herc?

1045
01:04:50.717 --> 01:04:52.863
You seem to be constantly
getting in the way of it.

1046
01:04:52.953 --> 01:04:54.108
You've got the wrong guy.

1047
01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:57.536
Hear me out, ya little...
Just hear me out, okay?

1048
01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:59.578
So I would be eternally grateful

1049
01:04:59.664 --> 01:05:02.616
if you would just take a day off
from this hero business of yours.

1050
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.686
I mean, monsters, natural disasters.
You wait a day, okay?

1051
01:05:05.775 --> 01:05:07.951
- You're out of your mind.
- Not so fast, because, ya see,

1052
01:05:07.974 --> 01:05:11.199
I do have a little leverage
you might wanna know about.

1053
01:05:11.967 --> 01:05:13.918
- Meg!
- Don't listen, Herc...

1054
01:05:16.361 --> 01:05:18.269
- Let her go!
- Here's the trade-off.

1055
01:05:18.359 --> 01:05:21.311
You give up your strength
for about 24 hours, okay?

1056
01:05:21.394 --> 01:05:23.301
Say the next 24 hours.

1057
01:05:23.391 --> 01:05:25.341
And Meg here is free as a bird
and safe from harm.

1058
01:05:25.428 --> 01:05:27.563
We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,
we carry on, we go home happy.

1059
01:05:27.586 --> 01:05:28.938
What d'ya say? Come on.

1060
01:05:30.022 --> 01:05:31.929
People are gonna get hurt, aren't they?

1061
01:05:32.019 --> 01:05:35.407
Nah! I mean, it's a possibility.
It happens 'cause, you know, it's war.

1062
01:05:35.494 --> 01:05:37.968
But what can I tell ya? Anyway,
what do you owe these people?

1063
01:05:38.051 --> 01:05:40.764
Isn't Meg, little smoochy face,
isn't she more important than they are?

1064
01:05:40.847 --> 01:05:42.798
- Stop it!
- Isn't she?

1065
01:05:42.884 --> 01:05:45.435
You've gotta swear
she'll be safe from any harm.

1066
01:05:45.522 --> 01:05:47.351
Fine, okay. I'll give you that one.

1067
01:05:47.438 --> 01:05:50.271
Meg is safe, otherwise you get your
strength right back. Yadda yadda.

1068
01:05:50.353 --> 01:05:53.502
Fine print. Boilerplate. Okay? Done.
What d'ya say we shake on it?

1069
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:55.824
Hey, I really don't have, like,
time to bat this around.

1070
01:05:55.907 --> 01:05:57.681
I'm kind of on a schedule here.
I got plans for August. Okay?

1071
01:05:57.704 --> 01:06:00.690
I need an answer, like, now.
Going once, going twice...

1072
01:06:00.779 --> 01:06:03.733
- All right!
- Yes, we're there! Bam!

1073
01:06:11.245 --> 01:06:13.959
You may feel just a little queasy.
It's kinda natural.

1074
01:06:14.041 --> 01:06:15.871
Maybe you should sit down!

1075
01:06:17.995 --> 01:06:21.908
Now you know how it feels
to be just like everybody else.

1076
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:24.823
Isn't it just peachy?

1077
01:06:25.586 --> 01:06:27.699
Oh!
You'll love this. One more thing.

1078
01:06:27.782 --> 01:06:32.131
Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.
You're off the hook.

1079
01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:35.841
And by the way, Herc,
is she not a fabulous little actress?

1080
01:06:35.932 --> 01:06:37.358
- Stop it.
- What do you mean?

1081
01:06:37.448 --> 01:06:41.361
I mean your little chickie-poo here
was working for me all the time.

1082
01:06:41.443 --> 01:06:42.401
Duh.

1083
01:06:42.482 --> 01:06:44.476
You're... You're lying!

1084
01:06:45.398 --> 01:06:49.985
- Help!
- Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.

1085
01:06:50.071 --> 01:06:52.545
Couldn't have done it without you,
sugar, sweetheart, babe.

1086
01:06:52.628 --> 01:06:53.902
No! It's not like that.

1087
01:06:53.986 --> 01:06:56.731
I didn't mean to... I couldn't... I...

1088
01:06:57.101 --> 01:06:58.889
I'm so sorry.

1089
01:06:58.979 --> 01:07:03.087
Our hero's a zero! Our hero's a zero!

1090
01:07:04.211 --> 01:07:05.965
Well, gotta blaze.

1091
01:07:06.049 --> 01:07:10.397
There's a whole cosmos up there
waiting for me with, hey, my name on it.

1092
01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.188
So much for the preliminaries,
and now on to the main event!

1093
01:07:28.697 --> 01:07:31.846
Brothers! Titans!

1094
01:07:31.933 --> 01:07:35.039
Look at you in your squalid prison!

1095
01:07:35.128 --> 01:07:38.081
Who put you down there?

1096
01:07:38.164 --> 01:07:40.191
Zeus!

1097
01:07:40.282 --> 01:07:46.472
And now that I set you free, what is
the first thing you are going to do?

1098
01:07:46.793 --> 01:07:50.018
- Destroy him!
- Good answer.

1099
01:07:52.304 --> 01:07:56.130
Crush Zeus!

1100
01:07:58.736 --> 01:08:01.809
Freeze him!

1101
01:08:06.047 --> 01:08:08.401
Melt Zeus!

1102
01:08:09.441 --> 01:08:14.106
Blow him away!

1103
01:08:16.511 --> 01:08:18.581
Zeus!

1104
01:08:20.785 --> 01:08:22.453
- Uh, guys?
- Huh?

1105
01:08:22.783 --> 01:08:24.613
Olympus would be that way.

1106
01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:28.652
- Zeus!
- Freeze him!

1107
01:08:29.453 --> 01:08:31.240
Hold it, bright eye.

1108
01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:34.236
I have a special job for you,
my optic friend.

1109
01:08:40.718 --> 01:08:42.232
Ah, huh?

1110
01:08:42.436 --> 01:08:45.062
Destroy Zeus!

1111
01:08:45.232 --> 01:08:48.304
Oh, we're in trouble!
Big trouble! I gotta...

1112
01:08:48.866 --> 01:08:51.177
My lord and lady,
the Titans have escaped,

1113
01:08:51.263 --> 01:08:53.169
and they're practically at our gates!

1114
01:08:53.261 --> 01:08:57.173
Sound the alarm!
Launch an immediate counterattack!

1115
01:08:57.255 --> 01:08:59.686
- Go! Go!
- Gone, babe.

1116
01:09:02.527 --> 01:09:03.563
Huh?

1117
01:09:08.639 --> 01:09:09.794
Charge!

1118
01:09:09.877 --> 01:09:10.835
Yah!

1119
01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:12.823
On to battle!

1120
01:09:18.626 --> 01:09:19.781
Eeyah!

1121
01:09:23.778 --> 01:09:25.445
You windbag!

1122
01:09:27.333 --> 01:09:30.046
Boom, badda-boom, boom, boom!
Hah!

1123
01:09:33.365 --> 01:09:36.711
Hercules!

1124
01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.826
Where are you?

1125
01:09:41.833 --> 01:09:43.979
What can we do?

1126
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:47.144
- Where is Hercules?
- Yeah, Hercules'll save us.

1127
01:09:47.227 --> 01:09:51.017
Hercules!

1128
01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:55.568
Come out! Face me!

1129
01:09:56.892 --> 01:09:59.998
What are you doing?
Without your strength, you'll be killed.

1130
01:10:00.528 --> 01:10:02.521
There are worse things.

1131
01:10:02.604 --> 01:10:03.792
Run!

1132
01:10:03.883 --> 01:10:06.509
Wait! Stop!

1133
01:10:06.599 --> 01:10:09.911
- Hey, look! It's Hercules.
- Thank the gods!

1134
01:10:09.994 --> 01:10:12.826
- We're saved!
- So...

1135
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:15.819
You mighty Hercules.

1136
01:10:22.257 --> 01:10:23.772
Oh!

1137
01:10:27.889 --> 01:10:30.080
Easy, horsefeathers.

1138
01:10:30.166 --> 01:10:32.553
Whoa, stop twitching.

1139
01:10:32.643 --> 01:10:35.716
Listen. Hercules is in trouble.

1140
01:10:36.437 --> 01:10:37.505
We've gotta find Phil.

1141
01:10:37.596 --> 01:10:39.982
He's the only one
who can talk some sense into him.

1142
01:10:44.347 --> 01:10:46.614
Get back, blast you!

1143
01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:53.567
- Ooh, Chihuahua.
- Zeus!

1144
01:10:55.771 --> 01:10:58.876
Come on! Hurry up!
We're shovin' off here!

1145
01:10:59.006 --> 01:11:00.434
Phil!

1146
01:11:00.604 --> 01:11:02.631
Phil, Hercules needs your help!

1147
01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.270
What does he need me for
when he's got friends like you?

1148
01:11:05.357 --> 01:11:09.706
- He won't listen to me.
- Good! He's finally learned something.

1149
01:11:09.792 --> 01:11:12.898
Look, I know what I did was wrong,
but this isn't about me.

1150
01:11:12.987 --> 01:11:17.095
It's about him.
If you don't help him now, Phil, he'll die.

1151
01:11:17.221 --> 01:11:19.412
I need more thunderbolts!

1152
01:11:19.498 --> 01:11:21.884
Hephaestus has been captured,
my lord.

1153
01:11:21.975 --> 01:11:24.241
Everyone's been captured.
I've been captured!

1154
01:11:24.332 --> 01:11:26.205
Hey, hey! Watch the glasses.

1155
01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.030
Zeusy, I'm home!

1156
01:11:35.116 --> 01:11:38.789
Hades. You're behind this!

1157
01:11:38.872 --> 01:11:40.506
You are correct, sir!

1158
01:11:44.982 --> 01:11:46.771
Flea.

1159
01:11:51.134 --> 01:11:53.924
- Hercules!
- Phil.

1160
01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:55.918
Come on, kid. Come on. Fight back.

1161
01:11:56.047 --> 01:11:58.957
Come on, you can take this bum.
This guy's a pushover. Look at him.

1162
01:11:59.043 --> 01:12:00.994
You were right all along, Phil.

1163
01:12:02.158 --> 01:12:03.946
Dreams are for rookies.

1164
01:12:04.037 --> 01:12:07.143
No, no, no, no, kid.
Givin' up is for rookies.

1165
01:12:07.232 --> 01:12:09.182
I came back
'cause I'm not quittin' on ya.

1166
01:12:09.269 --> 01:12:11.383
I'm willing to go the distance.

1167
01:12:11.466 --> 01:12:12.937
How 'bout you?

1168
01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.650
Me bite off head!

1169
01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:24.477
Whoa, baby!

1170
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:39.660
Hercules! Look out!

1171
01:12:39.786 --> 01:12:42.457
Meg! No!

1172
01:12:51.051 --> 01:12:52.718
What's happening?

1173
01:12:54.367 --> 01:12:57.079
Hades' deal is broken.

1174
01:12:58.201 --> 01:13:00.272
He promised I wouldn't get hurt.

1175
01:13:00.998 --> 01:13:02.665
Meg.

1176
01:13:02.755 --> 01:13:05.425
Why did you...

1177
01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:06.742
You didn't have to...

1178
01:13:06.829 --> 01:13:11.776
Oh, people always do crazy things
when they're in love.

1179
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.414
Oh, Meg.

1180
01:13:14.937 --> 01:13:16.889
Meg, I... I...

1181
01:13:17.373 --> 01:13:20.688
Are you always this articulate?

1182
01:13:23.805 --> 01:13:27.510
You haven't got much time.
You can still stop Hades.

1183
01:13:28.599 --> 01:13:30.986
I'll watch over her, kid.

1184
01:13:31.834 --> 01:13:33.709
You're gonna be all right.

1185
01:13:34.032 --> 01:13:35.905
I promise.

1186
01:13:38.266 --> 01:13:40.053
Let's go, Pegasus!

1187
01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:45.252
Hup, two, three, four.
Come on, everybody!

1188
01:13:45.415 --> 01:13:47.291
- I can't hear you!
- Oh, oh!

1189
01:13:47.972 --> 01:13:51.960
I swear to you, Hades,
when I get out of this...

1190
01:13:52.046 --> 01:13:54.835
I'm the one giving orders now, bolt boy.

1191
01:13:54.923 --> 01:13:57.232
And I think I'm gonna like it here.

1192
01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.990
Don't get too comfortable, Hades!

1193
01:14:01.592 --> 01:14:02.987
Hercules!

1194
01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:05.306
This ought to even the odds!

1195
01:14:07.865 --> 01:14:10.339
Yeah, Hercules! Thank you, man.

1196
01:14:10.421 --> 01:14:11.695
Get them!

1197
01:14:14.177 --> 01:14:16.127
Whoa! Hey!

1198
01:14:16.214 --> 01:14:20.201
No! Get him! Not me! Him!

1199
01:14:21.925 --> 01:14:26.230
Follow the fingers! Him!
The yutz with the horse.

1200
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:34.584
Thank you, my boy.

1201
01:14:34.748 --> 01:14:39.215
Nice horsey! My intentions were pure!
I really was attracted to you.

1202
01:14:42.097 --> 01:14:43.405
Throw!

1203
01:14:43.495 --> 01:14:44.452
Hah!

1204
01:14:44.534 --> 01:14:47.444
Now watch your old man work!

1205
01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:48.487
Uh-oh.

1206
01:14:52.044 --> 01:14:57.034
Guys, get your titanic rears in gear
and kick some Olympian butt!

1207
01:14:57.795 --> 01:14:59.462
Whoa, is my hair out?

1208
01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.354
- Hah!
- Whoo-hoo!

1209
01:15:25.637 --> 01:15:27.304
Thanks a ton, Wonderboy.

1210
01:15:27.395 --> 01:15:30.065
But at least
I've got one swell consolation prize,

1211
01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:33.735
a friend of yours who's dying to see me.

1212
01:15:33.826 --> 01:15:35.253
Meg.

1213
01:16:04.623 --> 01:16:05.811
Meg.

1214
01:16:12.213 --> 01:16:13.924
Meg, no.

1215
01:16:33.264 --> 01:16:35.334
Oh, I'm sorry, kid.

1216
01:16:37.297 --> 01:16:40.162
There's some things
you just can't change.

1217
01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:44.996
Yes, I can.

1218
01:16:48.642 --> 01:16:50.910
We were so close!

1219
01:16:50.998 --> 01:16:52.425
So close.

1220
01:16:52.516 --> 01:16:54.303
We tripped at the finish line. Why?

1221
01:16:54.395 --> 01:16:58.185
Because our little nut, Meg,
has to go all noble.

1222
01:17:02.383 --> 01:17:04.976
- Where's Meg?
- Oh, look who's here.

1223
01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.173
Wonderboy, you are too much.

1224
01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:10.929
- Let her go.
- Get a grip.

1225
01:17:11.011 --> 01:17:13.037
Come here, come here.
Let me show you around.

1226
01:17:13.847 --> 01:17:17.312
Hmph. Well, well.
It's a small underworld after all. Huh?

1227
01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:20.275
Meg! Ahhh!

1228
01:17:20.359 --> 01:17:22.068
No, no, no. Mustn't touch.

1229
01:17:22.156 --> 01:17:24.585
You see, Meg's
running with a new crowd these days.

1230
01:17:24.711 --> 01:17:26.466
And not a very lively one, at that.

1231
01:17:28.228 --> 01:17:31.334
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.

1232
01:17:31.422 --> 01:17:36.772
Well. The son of my hated rival
trapped forever in a river of death.

1233
01:17:36.855 --> 01:17:39.165
- Going once.
- Ls there a downside to this?

1234
01:17:39.252 --> 01:17:42.205
- Going twice!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1235
01:17:42.288 --> 01:17:45.600
You get her out. She goes, you stay.

1236
01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.954
You know what slipped my mind?

1237
01:17:50.036 --> 01:17:51.823
You'll be dead
before you can get to her.

1238
01:17:51.914 --> 01:17:53.430
That's not a problem, is it?

1239
01:18:18.677 --> 01:18:19.634
Oh!

1240
01:18:20.634 --> 01:18:22.944
What's the matter with these scissors?

1241
01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:25.418
The thread won't cut.

1242
01:18:32.658 --> 01:18:35.251
This is... This is impossible!

1243
01:18:35.335 --> 01:18:38.124
You can't be alive! You'd have to be a...

1244
01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:39.562
- A god?
- A god?

1245
01:18:44.042 --> 01:18:47.594
Hercules, stop!
You can't do this to me. You can't...

1246
01:18:47.676 --> 01:18:49.867
Fine. Okay. Listen.

1247
01:18:49.953 --> 01:18:52.820
Okay. Well, I deserved that.
Herc, Herc, Herc. Can we talk?

1248
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:54.739
Your dad, he's a fun guy, right?

1249
01:18:54.827 --> 01:18:56.941
So maybe you could
put in a word with him,

1250
01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:59.213
and he'd kinda blow this
whole thing off, you know?

1251
01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:01.775
Meg, Meg, talk to him.
A little schmooze...

1252
01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:06.603
Eww! Get away from me!
Don't touch me!

1253
01:19:06.691 --> 01:19:09.524
Get your slimy souls off me!

1254
01:19:10.286 --> 01:19:12.715
He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.

1255
01:19:12.802 --> 01:19:15.548
You mean, if he gets outta there.

1256
01:19:15.638 --> 01:19:17.511
- If. If is good.
- Taxi!

1257
01:19:17.595 --> 01:19:19.742
I don't feel so good. I feel a little...

1258
01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.030
Wonderboy, what...

1259
01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.587
Why did you...

1260
01:19:48.193 --> 01:19:51.146
People always do crazy things

1261
01:19:51.229 --> 01:19:52.655
when they're in love.

1262
01:20:00.776 --> 01:20:03.130
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Whoo!

1263
01:20:14.397 --> 01:20:16.751
Three cheers for the mighty Hercules!

1264
01:20:16.833 --> 01:20:19.263
Oh, yeah! Flowers for everybody! Oh!

1265
01:20:32.612 --> 01:20:36.437
Hercules, we're so proud of you.

1266
01:20:37.565 --> 01:20:38.752
Mother.

1267
01:20:40.041 --> 01:20:40.998
Hah!

1268
01:20:41.079 --> 01:20:44.349
Fine work, my boy! You've done it!

1269
01:20:44.436 --> 01:20:46.745
You're a true hero.

1270
01:20:46.831 --> 01:20:50.863
You were willing to give your life
to rescue this young woman.

1271
01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:54.531
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength,

1272
01:20:54.621 --> 01:20:57.454
but by the strength of his heart.

1273
01:20:58.176 --> 01:21:02.241
Now, at last, my son,

1274
01:21:02.889 --> 01:21:05.483
you can come home.

1275
01:21:18.348 --> 01:21:22.412
Congratulations, Wonderboy.
You'll make one heck of a god.

1276
01:21:30.132 --> 01:21:34.316
Father, this is the moment
I've always dreamed of.

1277
01:21:35.245 --> 01:21:36.519
But...

1278
01:21:38.441 --> 01:21:42.951
A life without Meg,
even an immortal life,

1279
01:21:43.234 --> 01:21:45.947
would be empty.

1280
01:21:47.548 --> 01:21:48.703
I...

1281
01:21:50.024 --> 01:21:52.411
I wish to stay on Earth with her.

1282
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.767
I finally know where I belong.

1283
01:22:08.479 --> 01:22:10.189
Hit it, ladies!
