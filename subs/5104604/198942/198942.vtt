1
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,245
Careful!

2
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,585
It's canvas! This ship is made of canvas!

3
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:43,711
Don't damage it.

4
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,506
Don't just stand there! It's crowded here.

5
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,098
Hurry up... this way!

6
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,434
I hate slackers!

7
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,353
You... this way.

8
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:03,314
He's fine. Come on!

9
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,150
You aren't here to play!

10
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,656
What an amazing engine.

11
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:16,118
Where'd he go? Uncle! Uncle!

12
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:22,333
Uncle... here's the assistant you wanted.

13
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,628
NOT SO LOUD!! I ain't deaf.

14
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,259
He's worse than Mama. Be careful.

15
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:39,308
It's so cramped, my hand won't go in.

16
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,062
It's this packing, isn't it.

17
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,271
What's your name?

18
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:51,487
The Levistone pointed due east, did it?

19
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:58,285
From the tower, I could see the sun rise.
Now is the mowing season.

20
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:02,248
So the sunrise is a little
south of true east.
The sun rose left of the hills.

21
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:05,418
The Levistone light
crossed the left tip of the sun's edge.

22
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:08,546
Good answer. How are things up there?

23
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,548
I'm getting nothing.

24
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:14,301
So, they're jamming the radio to hide
their whereabouts, are they?!

25
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,097
Mama, the Goliath's moving pretty fast!
What'll we do?

26
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:24,061
We'll be on their windward side.
If we use the trade winds...

27
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:29,108
20, 000 feet and ride the jet stream...
With wind speed 10...

28
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,110
We'll do it somehow.

29
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,950
Everybody, listen up!
We are setting course for Laputa.

30
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,995
Our ship will now commence top-speed pursuit!

31
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,040
Using the wind, we should be able
to make contact tomorrow!

32
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,960
And I'll give 10 gold
pieces to the first to spot her!

33
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,170
10 gold pieces!

34
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,173
Laputa is some sort of flying island.

35
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,426
There's probably enough
treasure for everybody.

36
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,429
So! Everybody... GET TO WORK!

37
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:07,021
Now!

38
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,782
Course 98. Velocity 40!

39
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,815
There's nothing your size.

40
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:52,775
Put this on.

41
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,037
Here's your post.

42
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,761
Five meals a day. Conserve water.

43
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:31,814
You morons! Get back to work!

44
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:35,627
Sorry, dinner isn't ready yet.
It's my first airship kitchen.

45
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,589
Did you want something?

46
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,681
I have some spare time,
so I thought I'd be of some help.

47
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,601
Well, thank you. Would you do that washing?

48
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,560
No problem.

49
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,609
Hey, you said your back hurt.

50
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,570
I had some spare time and thought I'd help.

51
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,448
Men Out of the way.

52
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,659
Men Don't push.

53
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,661
Hey, can I be of some help?

54
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:24,467
So, you were scared too?
And they have the Goliath to help them...

55
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,635
Sounds hopeless.

56
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,639
It's the island of Laputa, so it's no wonder.

57
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,642
They're certainly good kids, those two.

58
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,395
What do you want me to say, you stupid old man?

59
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,399
Nothing. But you should show me more respect.

60
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,942
What?!

61
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,278
That's checkmate, isn't it?

62
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,288
Umm... if anyone wants seconds...

63
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,248
Seconds!

64
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,227
Hey! Get up.

65
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,442
It's your watch. Take this, it's cold out.

66
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,069
The lookout?

67
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,070
Yeah.

68
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,369
It's cold! You're up top.

69
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,670
I'm second shift.

70
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,671
Thanks.

71
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,358
That was scary!

72
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,403
It's beautiful.

73
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:21,125
Get in.

74
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,255
Can't sleep?

75
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,008
It's warm.

76
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,301
Sheeta, you look behind.

77
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,102
I'm scared beyond words.

78
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:44,314
The truth is,
I don't want to go to Laputa at all.

79
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:48,193
I hope we don't find the Goliath.

80
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:54,116
There are just too many
strange and powerful... well...

81
00:08:54,116 --> 00:09:00,122
You mean like what happened with the robot?
That was sad, wasn't it.

82
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,295
And it happened because of a spell
taught to me by my grandmother.

83
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:10,257
I learned many other spells, too.

84
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:15,262
To find things, and to cure
illness and words I must
absolutely never use...

85
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:17,139
Words you must never use?

86
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,143
Spells of destruction,
good spells to bestow power...

87
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:26,065
She said I must also
know the bad words but never use them.

88
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,984
After I learned them,
I was too afraid to sleep.

89
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,113
And it all had to do with the stone.

90
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:38,202
It was always hidden in the fireplace,
and except at weddings, never used...

91
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:43,999
Mother, and Grandmother,
and Grandmother's Grandmother...
everybody feared it!

92
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:46,043
I wish it had never existed!

93
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,006
You're wrong. I met you, thanks to that stone.

94
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,052
And thanks to that stone, Laputa won't be lost.

95
00:09:55,052 --> 00:10:00,057
All our progress with flying machines,
and no one's seen it but my father.

96
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,937
And what if Laputa is really
an island of terror?

97
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:08,148
It mustn't fall into the hands
of Muska and the others.

98
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:13,862
Besides... if we run away now,
we'll be chased forever.

99
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:17,116
But I don't want to make you
a pirate for my sake.

100
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,952
I won't become a pirate.

101
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,872
Even Dora understands.
I think she's really a good person.

102
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:28,002
When this is all over,
I'm sure she'll take you back to Gondoa.

103
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:33,090
I want to see it. The old house
where you were born, and the yaks.

104
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,845
What's that?!

105
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,848
Underneath the ship... there!

106
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,232
It's the Goliath. It's right below us!

107
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,823
Hard to starboard!

108
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,939
Muska, why aren't we chasing them?
They'll get away!

109
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:36,904
It's no use, in the clouds.
Anyway, they can't run far!

110
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,865
We're on course and everything's
going smoothly.

111
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,963
The course was more north.

112
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:59,677
Pazu, there's no time. Listen up!
If we don't shake off the Goliath,
we're finished!

113
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,263
You have good eyes.
I want you to stay in the lookout.
If we leave the clouds, they'll pursue.

114
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:04,473
What should I do?

115
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:08,310
That lookout post will turn into a kite.
There should be a handle inside.

116
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,269
Found it!

117
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:12,314
If you turn it clockwise, the hook will catch.

118
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,776
If you turn the upper handle,
the wings will open!

119
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,910
When it's open, don't stretch the wire.
Remember to steer with your body!

120
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,037
Is Sheeta up there?

121
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,331
You better come back down!

122
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,332
Why?

123
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,918
WHY? Because you're a little girl!

124
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:37,965
Auntie, you're a girl, too! Besides,
I'm mountain-bred. I have good eyes, too.

125
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,758
Please...

126
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,093
Pazu agrees with me!

127
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:48,934
If you go up, don't use the voice tube.
There's an internal telephone.

128
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,396
Is this the phone you were talking about,
Auntie?

129
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,689
Wow.

130
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,775
Yes... we'll try. Let us up!

131
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,735
Go!

132
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:19,797
I can't see it.

133
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:21,799
They've dived into the clouds.

134
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:24,802
Be careful. They may not be in front of us.

135
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:26,596
Okay!

136
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,767
Hang on tight!

137
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:37,732
What's wrong?!

138
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:39,734
Turbulence... we're okay!

139
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,612
Just a little stirred up!

140
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:45,698
Yes! I'll continue the watch.

141
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:47,658
Scared?

142
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:51,746
I've gotten the hang of it now.
It's a little stormy.

143
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,628
Sheeta, get the rope out of my bag.

144
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,714
Tie us together with it.

145
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:02,715
Okay.

146
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:08,554
The barometer is falling fast, Mama.

147
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:11,599
A storm. What rotten luck.
How long until sunrise?

148
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:13,559
One hour!

149
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:31,536
It's dawn!

150
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:35,373
Pazu, that's strange.
The sun is rising on that side.

151
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:39,419
I see! We must be going north,
not east! Bridge!

152
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,338
We're going north, you say?!

153
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:44,048
The compass is pointing east!

154
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:47,969
The wind's changed. We're off course!

155
00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:48,970
Look... there!

156
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,097
What's the matter... the Goliath?

157
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:54,100
The clouds. They're huge.

158
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:55,601
The clouds?

159
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:58,604
They're coming this way!

160
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:12,827
It's a sky castle...

161
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:18,833
THAT'S a low pressure center! The ship
won't stand the wind. Full power! Due north!

162
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,561
It's coming closer!

163
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:40,563
All right! We're trying!

164
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,614
The rudder won't move!

165
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:51,699
Always the damn power! What's wrong?

166
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:54,243
Dora! The engine'll burn up!

167
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:58,206
I don't want any complaints! Just do it!

168
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,334
Get out of the clouds!

169
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,467
Sheeta, it's the ocean!

170
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,481
The Dragon's Nest!

171
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:26,526
This... is the Dragon's Nest?!

172
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:40,331
The wind is blowing in the wrong direction,
just like father said.

173
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:46,254
It's a wall of wind!

174
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,132
Mama, we can't get out!

175
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:51,676
We're being sucked in.
The wind just won't quit!

176
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,637
Bridge! Laputa is in there!

177
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:55,722
What?

178
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:59,600
Father saw Laputa in the Dragon's Nest!

179
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,603
You're crazy! If we go in, we'll be torn apart!

180
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:04,313
Over there!

181
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,153
Now, of all times...!

182
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:26,169
Let's go, Auntie! It's the way Father took,
and he came back!

183
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:29,172
ALL RIGHT! Let's go... into the Dragon's Nest!

184
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:43,019
Yeah! We did it!

185
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:45,980
Our ship is in danger, too. We must retreat.

186
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,981
No! Carry on.

187
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:51,152
The light always indicates the center
of the whirling clouds.

188
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:56,157
Laputa is inside the storm. Steady as she goes.

189
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:59,160
There must be an entrance.

190
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,719
Hang on, Sheeta!

191
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,107
Sheeta!

192
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,735
Are you okay?

193
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,158
Look...

194
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,381
Laputa...

195
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,968
Sorry!

196
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,638
Wait; it's still pretty tightly knotted.

197
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,810
My hands are shaking.

198
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,436
There are birds here.

199
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:36,398
What do you suppose happened to everyone?

200
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,118
It's coming to meet you, Sheeta.

201
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,245
But I don't have the Levistone.

202
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:51,705
A knife will free us.

203
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:12,684
What are you doing!?

204
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:13,810
Wait!

205
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,815
Please, don't break that.
We can't go back without it.

206
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,457
It's a Hitaki nest!

207
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,459
It came because of this?

208
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,133
Oh, good... the eggs aren't broken.

209
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,510
Not afraid, are they?

210
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,353
Let's follow it.

211
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,687
Do you know the words?

212
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,230
Don't worry about that!

213
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,047
It's a city!

214
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,994
We must be inside the buildings.

215
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,208
Sheeta, the sky...

216
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:12,470
It looked like stone walls from the outside.

217
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,473
But, if their science was so advanced, why...?

218
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,784
It's a tomb, isn't it?

219
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,205
Forgotten writing...

220
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,336
Did you do this?

221
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,799
It's not the same robot as before!

222
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,806
It must be a gardening robot.

223
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,947
There weren't any people...

224
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:57,909
Who knows how long it's been
standing guard here.

225
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,677
You offered flowers before the tomb?

226
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,432
Thank you.

227
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:23,727
You're all alone?

228
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,729
Aren't there any other robots here?

229
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,758
Doesn't look lonely at all, does it...

230
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:59,804
It has friends. Cares for the Hitaki nests,
too. It won't die.

231
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:17,365
This way!

232
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:30,837
The floor has crumbled.

233
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:52,275
The Tiger Moth made it.

234
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:54,527
Auntie and the others are probably okay.

235
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,364
Sheeta... over there!

236
00:28:58,364 --> 00:29:00,366
Everyone was caught!

237
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:02,577
They've tied them up.

238
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:04,412
Can't we rescue them?

239
00:29:04,412 --> 00:29:05,371
Let's go!

240
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:13,338
We've opened a way into the city.

241
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:16,341
Look at this...
there's a mountain of treasure inside!

242
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:20,345
Wow.

243
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:26,267
Do you like this? Want it?
You'll all get enough... rope that is!

244
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:29,229
Did you notify our country of
the discovery of Laputa?

245
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:30,396
I'll do it now.

246
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:33,441
Try to set up a difficult code.

247
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:35,860
HEY, NO STEALING!

248
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:41,115
Those fools are just blind enough.

249
00:29:58,007 --> 00:29:59,425
Amazing, these roots...

250
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:02,428
Sheeta, you can climb trees, right?

251
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:05,139
Let's go.

252
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:41,009
What they're doing is terrible...

253
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:44,012
If they go to the upper gardens...

254
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:47,974
Sheeta, we've got to get the Levistone back.

255
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:51,102
Only that will protect this
place from those thieves.

256
00:30:51,102 --> 00:30:54,022
Why have the clouds cleared?

257
00:30:54,022 --> 00:30:57,984
If it hadn't been like this,
they wouldn't have been able to land.

258
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:00,069
The effect of my spell...

259
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:04,824
This must be what Muska meant about
"the seal being broken."

260
00:31:04,824 --> 00:31:10,914
This castle is awakened,
because the holder of the Levistone
approached, riding on the storm.

261
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:14,042
If we don't act, Muska will become king...

262
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:17,128
and, after the plunder,
terrible things will start to happen.

263
00:31:17,128 --> 00:31:21,132
But how can I get the Levistone back?

264
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:23,967
Those words...

265
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:26,011
Those words?

266
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:28,639
Impossible... but...

267
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,001
We'll go around from below.

268
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:15,519
I'll jump first.

269
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:36,457
It's around here.

270
00:32:47,218 --> 00:32:48,219
Dear God...

271
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:55,226
This is it!

272
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:08,155
It's that brat!

273
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:12,243
Damn!

274
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:14,245
Don't shoot. I'll catch her!

275
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:18,082
Well, well... a queen.

276
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:25,214
Captain, what's going on?

277
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:29,093
The rest of the pirates.
One of them is hiding at your feet.

278
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:31,262
Yes sir! Find him!

279
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:36,225
Hold it!

280
00:33:41,981 --> 00:33:43,441
Get me a hand grenade!

281
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:45,109
It's Pazu.

282
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:49,947
What?

283
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,159
It's not what you think!

284
00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:05,004
Guards, fall in! Hurry!

285
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,096
Auntie!

286
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:17,099
They have Sheeta. I'm going to rescue her.

287
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,895
After I cut the ropes, get out of here.

288
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,111
Get far away!

289
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:31,572
Hey, wait!

290
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,367
Take these.

291
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,370
Thanks.

292
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:43,625
That boy will go far.

293
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:48,297
What?! Muska broke all the radios?

294
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:51,550
Yes, sir. We caught his men hiding
inside the ship.

295
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,386
Many of the bridge crew are seriously wounded.

296
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:59,433
The Captain is inside the lower hemisphere.
Some of the men saw him go in.

297
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:02,394
Traitor! He's finally showing his true colors.

298
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,605
Gather the troops. This is a spy hunt!

299
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:07,649
Gather all squads! Hurry up, squad 3.

300
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,694
Muska and his men are to be shot on sight.

301
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:12,696
Find the entrance!

302
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:36,553
Captain, what in the world is this place?

303
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:41,391
The nerve center of Laputa.
The castle and treasure
above are just rubbish.

304
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:44,394
The science of Laputa is completely
stored in here.

305
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:52,528
You will wait here.

306
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:53,529
Captain!

307
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:57,825
Beyond here, none but the royal
family may enter. It's a sanctuary.

308
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:02,371
What's this?

309
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,209
Tree roots, this deep?

310
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:12,256
One phrase,
and it will all be reduced to ashes.

311
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,424
Come on... this way.

312
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,024
Here it is!

313
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,074
Here, too?

314
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:56,133
Found it!

315
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,097
Look at this huge Levistone!

316
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:06,143
This is the source of Laputa's power.

317
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:11,190
Excellent. For 700 years it has been
waiting for the return of the king.

318
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,858
700 years?

319
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,487
Your clan forgot, didn't it?

320
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:27,080
It's the black stone! Just like in the legend!

321
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:36,173
I can read it! I can read it!

322
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,051
Who in the world are you?

323
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:44,056
I also have an old, secret name, Lucita.

324
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:47,976
My name is Romuska Palo Ul Laputa.

325
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:56,026
Your clan and mine were
originally one royal family.

326
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:59,029
But when we returned to the earth,
it divided into two.

327
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,123
Not a crack.

328
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:12,125
It's not ordinary stone.

329
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,127
Use all the bombs we've got!

330
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:17,965
Your Excellency, you cannot get in like that.

331
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,925
Muska, where are you?

332
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:15,856
Well... what are you waiting for?

333
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:17,858
Do come inside, your Excellency.

334
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:19,818
Yes. Follow me!

335
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:21,862
Follow His Excellency!

336
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:39,755
Wh... what is this place? Muska... come out!

337
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,590
Be silent.

338
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,347
What kind of trick is this?

339
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:54,645
Be quiet. You are before the King of Laputa.

340
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:56,772
Are you mad?

341
00:39:56,772 --> 00:40:03,779
Today, we celebrate the rebirth of a monarchy.
The rebirth of a global empire under one king.

342
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,826
Let me show you gentlemen the power of Laputa.

343
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:36,520
It is the heavenly fire that destroyed
Sodom and Gomorrah in the Old Testament,

344
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:40,691
and the arrows of heaven which took Ramayana,
Indora, and Atlantis.

345
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:44,611
The whole world will bow to Laputa again!

346
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:51,743
Excellent, Muska... you're a hero.
Now here is your reward.

347
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,420
The look on your face!

348
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,716
Run, everybody!

349
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:08,510
Die!

350
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:36,497
Those fools!

351
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:37,831
It's full of them...

352
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:39,833
Everybody... RUN!

353
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:45,506
Check the flapters!

354
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:48,509
Mama, let's fly!

355
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:49,968
Hurry, let's get away!

356
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:53,013
Be quiet. Don't raise your voices.

357
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:04,358
Why are those two waiting behind?
They'll end up falling.

358
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:08,278
I hope you don't anger me again...

359
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:14,785
... because it looks like we'll be
spending some time together.

360
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:22,876
I do hope they're not trying to get away.

361
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:29,508
They really intend to fight me.

362
00:42:59,163 --> 00:43:00,080
Robots.

363
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:51,215
Excellent! Don't you think that
this is a great show?

364
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:56,220
Look! The people - they look like garbage.

365
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,389
What are you doing?

366
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:16,031
Give it back. Be a good girl. Come on.

367
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:18,075
Please... open up!

368
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:30,045
Where do you think you're going?

369
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:32,589
Open up!

370
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:24,433
Sheeta! I'm coming through!

371
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:26,810
Get down!

372
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:30,856
Hurry, take this! Muska's here!

373
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,782
Throw it in the ocean.

374
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:50,918
That stone you have is important.
I'll trade the girl's life for it.

375
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:22,908
Get up! The game is over.

376
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:33,752
The old throne room isn't very splendid,
is it? Come here!

377
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:39,299
You say this is the throne room?
This is our grave.

378
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,804
Our country was destroyed,
and a king like you survived. How tragic!

379
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:50,561
I won't give you the stone.
You can't leave here without killing me.

380
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:54,565
Why was Laputa destroyed?
I know perfectly well.

381
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:57,776
There's a song in the valley of Gondoa.

382
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:01,780
I Let our souls fall to the earth;
Live as one with the winds.

383
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:06,869
I Pass the winter along with the seeds,
and sing together with birds for spring.

384
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:11,832
No matter how many weapons you have,
or how many poor robots you use,

385
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,751
you cannot live, parted from the earth.

386
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:22,676
Laputa will not be destroyed.
However many times, it will be reborn.

387
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:25,637
The power of Laputa is the dream
of the human race.

388
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,725
Your ears will be next.

389
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:35,731
On your knees! Beg for your life!
Get the stone back from the brat!

390
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:37,483
Wait!

391
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:42,571
I hid the stone. If you shoot her,
I won't return it.

392
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:47,618
Pazu... stay away; it's no use.
He's going to kill us, no matter what.

393
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:52,498
Brat... the girl's life for the stone.
Tell me where it is.

394
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:57,544
Or, are you just going to scare
me with that cannon?

395
00:47:58,629 --> 00:48:01,465
I want to talk with Sheeta - alone.

396
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:04,426
It's no use... throw the stone away and run!

397
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:08,430
I'll give you three minutes.

398
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:33,330
Sheeta... calm down. Listen closely.

399
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:42,756
Tell me those words. I'll say them, too.
The stone is in my left hand.

400
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,433
I've freed Auntie and the others.

401
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:59,398
Time's up! Let's hear your answer.

402
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:12,494
I Ba lusu!

403
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:44,943
My eyes... my eyes!

404
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:52,242
My eyes!

405
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,549
Mama, it's collapsing!

406
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,260
It can't be helped... launch!

407
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,261
Hurry!

408
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:26,068
Mama, look! The bottom is falling off!

409
00:51:16,118 --> 00:51:19,079
Sheeta was a good girl.

410
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,082
She used the words of destruction...

411
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:26,086
Those children protected Laputa
from those idiots.

412
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:31,300
The collapse has stopped!

413
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,058
It's the Levistone! What luck!

414
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:42,019
It's going up.

415
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:52,321
The tree! It may have them! Follow it!

416
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:40,786
The tree roots saved us.

417
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,971
We'll break the wire.

418
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:00,764
Let's go.

419
00:54:11,626 --> 00:54:14,712
What are you doing?
We're supposed to be going up!

420
00:54:14,712 --> 00:54:16,714
We can't like this!

421
00:54:22,553 --> 00:54:24,514
It's Sheeta!

422
00:54:24,764 --> 00:54:25,765
They're alive.

423
00:54:25,765 --> 00:54:27,183
It's the apprentice.

424
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,313
Auntie!

425
00:54:32,605 --> 00:54:34,649
Safe and alive, aren't you?

426
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:35,733
Everyone's okay!

427
00:54:36,567 --> 00:54:40,613
Everyone's okay except for my poor,
tattered ship.

428
00:54:41,572 --> 00:54:45,493
Don't be so sentimental.
You can build another ship.

429
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:49,622
Poor thing...
what a cruel way to get a haircut...

430
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,707
Auntie... ouch!

431
00:54:51,707 --> 00:54:53,459
Oh, sorry.

432
00:54:54,627 --> 00:54:58,548
Isn't it terrible? Worrying so,
while full of these!

433
00:55:01,509 --> 00:55:04,470
At any rate, we worried in our spare time...

434
00:55:29,537 --> 00:55:35,626
The reason the horizon shines
ano chiheisen kagayaku no wa

435
00:55:37,628 --> 00:55:44,802
is that somewhere it's hiding you.
dokoka ni kimi o kakushite iru kara

436
00:55:45,595 --> 00:55:52,935
The reason I long for the many lights
takusan no hi ga natsukashii no wa

437
00:55:54,437 --> 00:56:01,444
is that you are there in one of them.
ano doreka hitotsu ni kimi ga iru kara

438
00:56:02,361 --> 00:56:09,327
So, I set out, with a slice of bread,
saa dekake you hitokire no PAN

439
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:17,293
a knife, a lamp, stuffed in a bag.
NAIFU RAMPU kaban ni tsumekonde

440
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:27,220
Father left me his burning desire.
tou-san ga nokoshita atsui omoi

441
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:34,310
Mother gave me her eyes.
kaa-san ga kureta ano manazashi

442
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:42,985
The earth turns, hiding you.
chikyuu wa mawaru kimi o kakushite

443
00:56:45,279 --> 00:56:52,036
Shining eyes, twinkling lights.
kagayaku hitomi kirameku tomoshibi

444
00:56:53,246 --> 00:56:59,669
The earth turns, carrying you,
chikyuu wa mawaru kimi o nosete

445
00:57:01,337 --> 00:57:08,469
carrying us both who'll surely meet.
itsuka kitto deau bokura o nosete

446
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:32,201
Father left me his burning desire.
tou-san ga nokoshita atsui omoi

447
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:40,084
Mother gave me her eyes.
kaa-san ga kureta ano manazashi

448
00:57:42,253 --> 00:57:48,759
The earth turns, hiding you.
chikyuu wa mawaru kimi o kakushite

449
00:57:50,094 --> 00:57:56,851
Shining eyes, twinkling lights.
kagayaku hitomi kirameku tomoshibi

450
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:52,763
carrying us both who'll surely meet.
itsuka kitto deau bokura o nosete

451
00:57:52,763 --> 00:58:00,062
Ending theme Kimi o nosete (Carrying you)
