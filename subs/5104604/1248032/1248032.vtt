00:01:17.203 --> 00:01:20.748
Ten centuries ago,
before the Age of Obedience,

2
00:01:20.873 --> 00:01:24.669
free dogs roamed at liberty,
marking their territory.

3
00:01:24.794 --> 00:01:26.963
Seeking to extend its dominion,

4
00:01:27.088 --> 00:01:30.049
<i>the cat-loving Kobayashi Dynasty declared war</i>

5
00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:34.053
<i>and descended in force
upon the unwary four-legged beasts.</i>

6
00:01:34.178 --> 00:01:37.432
<i>On the eve of total canine annihilation,</i>

7
00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:39.851
<i>a child warrior sympathetic to the plight</i>

8
00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:43.313
<i>of the besieged underdog dogs
betrayed his species,</i>

9
00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:45.815
<i>beheaded the head of the head
of the Kobayashi clan</i>

10
00:01:46.232 --> 00:01:49.736
and pledged his sword
with the following battle-cry haiku.

11
00:01:56.701 --> 00:02:01.456
He would later be known
as the Boy Samurai of Legend, RIP.

12
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:03.624
At the end of the bloody dog wars,

13
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.253
the vanquished mongrels
became powerless house-pets:

14
00:02:07.712 --> 00:02:10.673
<i>tamed, mastered, scorned.</i>

15
00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.260
<i>But they survived and multiplied.</i>

16
00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.973
<i>The Kobayashis, however,</i>

17
00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:21.100
<i>never forgave their conquered foe.</i>

18
00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:45.560
<i>The Japanese archipelago,
20 years in the future.</i>

19
00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:17.425
<i>Canine Saturation has reached
epidemic proportions.</i>

20
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.887
<i>An outbreak of Snout-fever
rips through the City of Megasaki.</i>

21
00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:25.766
<i>Blizzards of infected fleas, worms,
ticks and lice menace the citizenship.</i>

22
00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:28.477
<i>Dog-Flu threatens to cross
the species threshold</i>

23
00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:30.271
<i>and enter the human disease-pool.</i>

24
00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:35.943
<i>In a special midnight-session
at the Municipal Dome,</i>

25
00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:39.572
<i>Mayor Kobayashi of Uni Prefecture
issues emergency orders</i>

26
00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:41.616
<i>calling for a hasty quarantine:</i>

27
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:45.494
<i>the expulsion and containment of all
breeds, both stray and domesticated.</i>

28
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.831
<i>By official decree,
Trash Island becomes an exile colony.</i>

29
00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:58.591
<i>The Isle of Dogs.</i>

30
00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:09.602
Respect-o.

31
00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.160
<i>It's not fair to the dogs.</i>

32
00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:31.749
<i>The path favored by Mayor Kobayashi
is cruel and unscientific.</i>

33
00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:34.835
<i>For a thousand years,
these resilient animals have loved,</i>

34
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.462
<i>served and protected us.</i>

35
00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:39.882
<i>Now, in their time of greatest need,
we forsake them again?</i>

36
00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:44.595
<i>A tidal-wave of Anti-Dog hysteria
has crippled our moral judgment.</i>

37
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.764
<i>Give me six months,
and I will deliver a serum.</i>

38
00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.391
<i>I'm this close, dammit.</i>

39
00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:52.561
<i>Dog-Flu will be eradicated.
Snout-fever will be defeated.</i>

40
00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:55.106
<i>Canine Saturation will be returned
to sustainable levels</i>

41
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:56.732
<i>and without mass-neutering!</i>

42
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.618
Whatever happened to man's best friend?

43
00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:20.840
No, no, no!

44
00:06:20.965 --> 00:06:22.901
The crowd is calling
for the immediate ratification

45
00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:24.760
and approval of the mayor's proposal.

46
00:06:29.974 --> 00:06:33.686
<i>As a gesture of public solidarity,
Mayor Kobayashi is calling upon</i>

47
00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:37.356
<i>his Assistant Hatchet-Man, Major-Domo,
to furnish the personal bodyguard-dog</i>

48
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.817
<i>of the mayoral-household, Spots Kobayashi,</i>

49
00:06:39.942 --> 00:06:43.571
<i>into the possession of the Committee
for Canine Desaturation.</i>

50
00:06:44.822 --> 00:06:48.593
<i>Spots will be the first dog to be
officially deported from the city.</i>

51
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.142
<i>Six months later.</i>

52
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:58.914
<i>Nomadic packs of once-domesticated
house-pets, sick and hungry,</i>

53
00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:03.377
<i>rove the garbage canyons and filthy
ravines, scrounging for scraps.</i>

54
00:09:03.502 --> 00:09:07.047
<i>One hundred per cent test positive
for the Dog-Flu germ.</i>

55
00:09:07.173 --> 00:09:11.343
<i>Symptoms: weight-loss, dizziness,</i>

56
00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:16.348
<i>narcolepsy, insomnia,
and extreme/aggressive behavior.</i>

57
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.189
<i>Three-quarters display signs
of early-onset Snout-fever:</i>

58
00:09:23.314 --> 00:09:25.858
<i>high-temperature, low blood-pressure,</i>

59
00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:29.278
<i>acute moodiness
and spasmodic nasal expiration.</i>

60
00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:34.325
<i>The exiled dog-population
grows weaker, sadder, angrier.</i>

61
00:09:37.745 --> 00:09:39.163
<i>Desperate.</i>

62
00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:18.911
Hey, wait a second.

63
00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:22.206
Before we attack each other and tear
ourselves to shreds like a pack of maniacs,

64
00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:25.292
let's just open the sack first
and see what's actually in it.

65
00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:28.295
It might not even be worth the trouble.

66
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.339
- What do you say?
- I'm not sure.

67
00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:31.966
Maybe.

68
00:10:32.091 --> 00:10:33.551
Alright.

69
00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:38.847
A rancid apple core;
two worm-eaten banana peels;

70
00:10:38.973 --> 00:10:40.408
a moldy rice cake; a dried-up pickle;

71
00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.285
tin of sardine bones;
a pile of broken egg-shells;

72
00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:44.515
an old, smushed-up, rotten gizzard
with maggots all over it...

73
00:10:44.603 --> 00:10:46.564
Okay, it's worth it.

74
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.283
Get out of here and don't come back.

75
00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:04.957
Sheesh, Igor. I think he chewed your ear off.

76
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:07.626
Hmm... Hmm.

77
00:11:38.324 --> 00:11:41.035
I don't think I can stomach
any more of this garbage.

78
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.329
- Same here.
- Words out of my mouth.

79
00:11:43.454 --> 00:11:46.790
I used to sleep on a lamb's-wool bean-bag
next to an electric space-heater.

80
00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.293
That's my territory. I'm an indoor dog.

81
00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:51.962
I starred in 22 consecutive
Doggy Chop commercials.

82
00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:54.381
Look at me now. I couldn't land an audition.

83
00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:58.302
I was the lead mascot for an undefeated
high-school baseball team.

84
00:11:58.427 --> 00:12:00.679
I lost all my spirit. I'm depressing.

85
00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:04.683
I only ask for what I've always had:
a balanced diet, regular grooming,

86
00:12:04.767 --> 00:12:07.227
and a general physical once a year.

87
00:12:07.353 --> 00:12:09.521
I think I might give up.

88
00:12:10.606 --> 00:12:13.734
- What, right now?
- Right now.

89
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.821
There's no future on Trash Island.

90
00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.946
You heard the rumor, right? About Buster.

91
00:12:20.032 --> 00:12:21.176
- Not sure.
- Can you remind me?

92
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.242
Who's Buster?

93
00:12:22.326 --> 00:12:23.386
Uh, my brother from another litter.

94
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.080
- What happened to him?
- Suicided.

95
00:12:26.205 --> 00:12:28.666
Hanged himself by his own leash.

96
00:12:28.874 --> 00:12:30.626
- Hmm.
- Oh, boy.

97
00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.254
I want my master.

98
00:12:34.338 --> 00:12:37.800
Ah...

99
00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:41.387
You make me sick.

100
00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:48.060
I've seen cats with more balls than you dogs.

101
00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:50.020
Stop licking your wounds!

102
00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:54.400
You hungry? Kill something and eat it.

103
00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:56.402
You sick? Take a long nap.

104
00:12:56.527 --> 00:12:59.822
You cold? Dig a hole in the ground,
crawl into it, and bury yourself.

105
00:12:59.947 --> 00:13:04.076
But nobody's giving up around here,
and don't you forget it, ever.

106
00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:05.452
You're Rex!

107
00:13:05.536 --> 00:13:06.537
You're King!

108
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.705
You're Duke!

109
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:08.872
You're Boss!

110
00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:10.708
I'm Chief.

111
00:13:10.833 --> 00:13:14.294
We're a pack of scary,
indestructible Alpha Dogs.

112
00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:19.258
You're talking like a bunch
of house-broken... pets.

113
00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:23.637
You don't understand.
Uh, how could you? You're a...

114
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:29.977
Go ahead, say it. I'm a stray, yeah.

115
00:13:59.423 --> 00:14:01.717
How does she keep her fur so clean?

116
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.428
There's no shampoo on Trash Island.

117
00:14:04.553 --> 00:14:07.306
You heard the rumor, right?
About her and Felix.

118
00:14:07.431 --> 00:14:08.742
- What'd they say?
- Felix? No.

119
00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:10.976
- What happened to them?
- They mated.

120
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:12.811
Ooh.

121
00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:14.539
Who is Felix again?

122
00:14:14.563 --> 00:14:17.065
All the ones I like: they're never in heat.

123
00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:20.444
Hey, now, that puddle-jumper's
flying crooked.

124
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:21.729
- Oh, you're right.
- Ease up.

125
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.655
- Pull up.
- He's gonna lose a wing.

126
00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:40.631
Wow.

127
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.992
<i>Part One: "The Little Pilot."</i>

128
00:15:11.328 --> 00:15:12.621
Small guy. Not much meat on him.

129
00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:13.705
Yeah, is he dead?

130
00:15:13.831 --> 00:15:15.374
- He looks dead.
- I have a question.

131
00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:17.417
Are we eating him, or is this a rescue?

132
00:15:17.543 --> 00:15:18.544
We don't know yet.

133
00:15:18.627 --> 00:15:19.962
Nobody's eating The Little Pilot.

134
00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:22.381
Not even the dead body of him.
Dogs don't eat masters.

135
00:15:22.506 --> 00:15:24.675
You're not our leader.
We all are. Let's take a vote.

136
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.386
All in favor of not eating
The Little Pilot, say "Aye".

137
00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:29.137
- Aye.
- Nay.

138
00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:43.837
First-things-first: let's open his helmet
so he can breathe some air if he's alive,

139
00:15:43.861 --> 00:15:46.047
then see if we can pull that
hunk of broken propeller-clutch

140
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.841
out of the side of his head
if it doesn't kill him.

141
00:15:47.865 --> 00:15:50.367
- Does that sound right?
- Yeah, that's right.

142
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.618
Mmm-hmm.

143
00:16:17.603 --> 00:16:20.397
Spots-u! Spots-u! Spots-u!

144
00:16:21.982 --> 00:16:23.483
We get the idea.

145
00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.444
You're looking for your lost dog, Spots.

146
00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:27.821
- Does anybody know him?
- Hmm. No.

147
00:16:27.905 --> 00:16:29.031
Uh-uh.

148
00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:36.455
Wow.

149
00:17:09.488 --> 00:17:12.091
In response to questions regarding
the purported disappearance

150
00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:15.744
of his ward Atari,
Mayor Kobayashi offers no comment

151
00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:19.081
<i>and urges reporters to respect
the privacy of the mayoral-household.</i>

152
00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:22.209
<i>Atari, aged 12, was last seen
early yesterday morning</i>

153
00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:26.338
<i>rolling a small airplane onto a runway
at Megasaki Executive Airport.</i>

154
00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.259
<i>24 hours later.</i>

155
00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:54.658
I bite.

156
00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:58.203
I beg your pardon. Ignore that dog.

157
00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:59.287
He's got Snout-fever.

158
00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:01.415
Just please follow us.

159
00:18:07.963 --> 00:18:09.691
Now, I never met him, but I asked around.

160
00:18:09.715 --> 00:18:10.983
I understand he made a lot of friends.

161
00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:12.927
He had a very good-natured
temperament, I'm told.

162
00:18:12.968 --> 00:18:14.261
Of course, you would know best.

163
00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.930
It's just a bit further up here on the left.

164
00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:20.058
Anyway, as I say, he seemed to have
been an extremely pleasant animal.

165
00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:24.688
Unfortunately, nobody could figure out
how to open his dog-cage.

166
00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.864
<i>Three years earlier.</i>

167
00:18:33.989 --> 00:18:36.783
<i>The sole survivor of last week's
colossal bullet-train disaster,</i>

168
00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:40.177
<i>a young boy named Atari, awoke
from a deep-coma early this morning</i>

169
00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:43.457
<i>to learn of his parents' tragic deaths
and also the intention</i>

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.085
<i>of his distant-uncle, Mayor Kobayashi,
to personally adopt him</i>

171
00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:49.463
<i>as ward to the mayoral-household.</i>

172
00:18:49.588 --> 00:18:51.108
<i>Upon his release from Megasaki General,</i>

173
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:53.901
<i>Atari who suffered the loss
of his right kidney</i>

174
00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:57.155
<i>and numerous broken bones in the crash
will live in sequestered quarters</i>

175
00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:59.181
<i>within the confines of Brick Mansion,</i>

176
00:18:59.306 --> 00:19:02.976
<i>where he will be educated
in solitude by private tutors.</i>

177
00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.854
<i>Atari has also been assigned
a security-detail for his own protection</i>

178
00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:10.525
<i>in the form of a highly trained
bodyguard-dog named Spots Kobayashi.</i>

179
00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:28.668
Um, you're my new master.

180
00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:31.213
My name is Spots. I'm at your service.

181
00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:35.008
I'll be protecting your welfare
and safety on an ongoing-basis.

182
00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.011
In other words: I'm your dog.

183
00:19:57.364 --> 00:20:01.034
Bodyguard-dog! Not pet!

184
00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:31.565
I can hear you, Master Atari.

185
00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:38.530
I can hear you.

186
00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:40.907
I can hear you. I can hear you.

187
00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:55.797
Oh, no.

188
00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:59.050
You need a key.

189
00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:55.435
- Where'd you get that?
- What? I always had this.

190
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.272
I stole it off the dead skeleton.

191
00:23:59.355 --> 00:24:01.483
Oh, no.

192
00:24:04.569 --> 00:24:07.655
Hey! The wrong dog died!

193
00:24:09.616 --> 00:24:11.367
The wrong dog died!

194
00:24:28.092 --> 00:24:30.678
The wrong... The wrong dog died.

195
00:24:34.307 --> 00:24:35.308
He's not Spots.

196
00:24:39.938 --> 00:24:41.940
Who is that?

197
00:24:52.158 --> 00:24:54.661
I can't smell him.

198
00:27:02.205 --> 00:27:03.485
This is child abuse.

199
00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:04.600
Chief, you fight the robot-dog.

200
00:27:04.624 --> 00:27:05.625
Wait. What?

201
00:27:05.708 --> 00:27:07.519
King, Duke, Boss?
You attack the three dog-catchers.

202
00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:08.771
- On it.
- I'll guard The Little Pilot.

203
00:27:08.795 --> 00:27:10.088
On my command. Ready?

204
00:27:10.213 --> 00:27:11.255
Wait a second!

205
00:27:11.339 --> 00:27:12.674
I am not gonna fight this robot!

206
00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.509
I'm against The Little Pilot, remember?

207
00:27:14.634 --> 00:27:15.927
I don't even believe in masters.

208
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.095
You're the best in a scrap.

209
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.680
We all know that. You like to fight.

210
00:27:18.805 --> 00:27:19.806
Well, let's take a vote.

211
00:27:19.931 --> 00:27:22.326
All in favor of Chief fighting
the robot-dog, say "Aye".

212
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.393
- Aye.
- Nay.

213
00:27:23.476 --> 00:27:24.477
Sic 'em.

214
00:28:55.485 --> 00:28:58.172
<i>My ward, Atari, has been
kidnapped against his will</i>

215
00:28:58.196 --> 00:29:01.991
<i>by a pack of disobedient,
contagious, infected animals.</i>

216
00:29:02.116 --> 00:29:04.452
<i>He will be rescued promptly,
returned to safety,</i>

217
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:07.413
<i>and grounded for the duration
of his childhood years.</i>

218
00:29:07.538 --> 00:29:10.100
<i>His five dog-abductors have been
identified through the use</i>

219
00:29:10.124 --> 00:29:13.669
<i>of advanced Tooth-and-Tail
Recognition Software:</i>

220
00:29:13.795 --> 00:29:17.131
<i>They will, of course, be captured
and violently destroyed.</i>

221
00:29:34.482 --> 00:29:36.526
Chief ought to get a check-up, too.

222
00:29:36.609 --> 00:29:38.611
He looks worse than anybody.

223
00:29:53.668 --> 00:29:55.670
I wish somebody spoke his language.

224
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:02.510
Sit-o!

225
00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:04.637
Well, I understood that. Sit down.

226
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:08.683
Sit-o!

227
00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:10.685
Chief! Sit!

228
00:30:11.978 --> 00:30:13.938
I don't sit.

229
00:30:15.022 --> 00:30:17.233
You're disobedient! Sit!

230
00:30:18.818 --> 00:30:20.236
No.

231
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.268
I wouldn't drink that, if I were you.

232
00:30:53.769 --> 00:30:56.314
It's full of toxic chemicals.

233
00:30:56.439 --> 00:30:58.357
How do you know?

234
00:30:58.482 --> 00:31:01.777
Because my sister-in-law drank it,
and her tongue turned black.

235
00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:04.488
Oh.

236
00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:07.450
You're Felix's mate.

237
00:31:08.868 --> 00:31:10.328
I beg your pardon?

238
00:31:10.453 --> 00:31:14.373
I mean, I think you mated
with Felix, if I heard it right?

239
00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:17.835
That's none of your business.

240
00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.398
No, no, I don't suggest whether
it actually happened or not.

241
00:31:21.422 --> 00:31:26.260
I'm just saying that I recognize you
from when I heard that rumor.

242
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.015
I think I'm going to say good-night.

243
00:31:31.098 --> 00:31:32.642
Wait, wait, wait. No.

244
00:31:32.767 --> 00:31:35.102
Wait. Start over. Who cares about Felix?

245
00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:38.564
I'm Chief. That's my name.

246
00:31:39.523 --> 00:31:41.317
I see.

247
00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:45.321
I'm introducing myself. Who are you?

248
00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:48.908
I thought you knew all about me.

249
00:31:48.991 --> 00:31:51.327
No, I don't know anything.

250
00:31:51.452 --> 00:31:52.512
I should've kept my mouth shut.

251
00:31:52.536 --> 00:31:53.537
It's all hearsay.

252
00:31:53.663 --> 00:31:56.540
Anyway, you're Nutmeg.

253
00:31:58.084 --> 00:32:00.252
So you do know me, after all.

254
00:32:01.295 --> 00:32:03.464
After all? Yes.

255
00:32:05.091 --> 00:32:06.926
You a show-dog, Nutmeg?

256
00:32:08.219 --> 00:32:09.512
I was bred as a show-dog.

257
00:32:09.595 --> 00:32:11.180
I was groomed for that purpose.

258
00:32:11.305 --> 00:32:12.431
It wasn't my choice.

259
00:32:12.515 --> 00:32:14.308
I don't consider it my identity.

260
00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:17.144
Anyway, look around.

261
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:19.397
What difference does it make now?

262
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:22.483
So that's a yes.

263
00:32:22.608 --> 00:32:26.112
So that's a: yes, I used to be.

264
00:32:28.239 --> 00:32:29.323
May I join you?

265
00:32:35.997 --> 00:32:38.082
You've been attacked.

266
00:32:38.207 --> 00:32:40.835
Hmm. What else is new?
You should see the other dog.

267
00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.855
Actually, I think he was made
of stainless-steel.

268
00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:45.506
I couldn't get my teeth into him.

269
00:32:45.631 --> 00:32:47.633
Who is The Little Pilot?

270
00:32:47.717 --> 00:32:49.510
What'd he do? Why are they after him?

271
00:32:50.803 --> 00:32:53.055
Nobody knows.

272
00:32:58.519 --> 00:33:01.063
You're a stray, aren't you?

273
00:33:01.188 --> 00:33:03.357
Yes, I'm a stray.

274
00:33:03.482 --> 00:33:06.694
But aren't we all?
In the last analysis, I mean?

275
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.073
Were you trained? For competition.

276
00:33:11.198 --> 00:33:12.783
I was a show-dog.

277
00:33:12.908 --> 00:33:15.661
- You know a few tricks, then.
- A few.

278
00:33:15.786 --> 00:33:17.788
Can I see one?

279
00:33:17.913 --> 00:33:20.041
Maybe if I get to know you better.

280
00:33:20.166 --> 00:33:22.168
Fair enough.

281
00:33:23.127 --> 00:33:24.920
It's not true, by the way.

282
00:33:25.004 --> 00:33:26.797
About me and Felix. For the record.

283
00:33:28.299 --> 00:33:30.718
I wouldn't bring puppies into this world.

284
00:33:32.011 --> 00:33:34.346
I don't believe in masters. I never did.

285
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.681
It's against my principles.

286
00:33:35.806 --> 00:33:38.476
But this is no place for a dog like you.

287
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:42.063
You belong somewhere. You've got papers.

288
00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:44.857
Oh, I'm full-grown, sweetheart.

289
00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.942
You don't have to worry about me.

290
00:33:47.777 --> 00:33:49.195
Good-night.

291
00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:53.908
I hope I'll see you again.

292
00:33:57.745 --> 00:33:59.830
- Here's one.
- One what?

293
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.922
I'm supposed to be spinning a nine-pound
bowling-ball over my head at this point,

294
00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:09.965
but you just have to imagine that part.

295
00:34:11.592 --> 00:34:12.885
Oh.

296
00:34:12.968 --> 00:34:14.845
I can picture it.

297
00:34:15.888 --> 00:34:18.849
Will you help him? The Little Pilot?

298
00:34:19.892 --> 00:34:21.393
Why should I?

299
00:34:21.519 --> 00:34:23.938
Because he's a 12-year-old boy.

300
00:34:24.063 --> 00:34:26.065
Dogs love those.

301
00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:32.677
<i>Spots, whoever he is, might be alive,
and he might be dead,</i>

302
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.825
but one thing's for sure:
he's nowhere around here.

303
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:37.827
He's not in the dog-community.

304
00:34:37.952 --> 00:34:41.413
There's probably another 500 Japanese
hectares of unmapped waste-land

305
00:34:41.539 --> 00:34:43.415
on Trash Island at least.

306
00:34:43.541 --> 00:34:44.583
Where do we start?

307
00:34:44.708 --> 00:34:47.378
Also, the mental health question:

308
00:34:47.503 --> 00:34:50.107
maybe it's because of that propeller-clutch
stuck in the side of his head

309
00:34:50.131 --> 00:34:54.343
I can't say, I'm not a doctor, but I think
The Little Pilot's got a screw loose.

310
00:34:54.927 --> 00:34:56.595
Those are the cons.

311
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.722
You heard the rumor, right?
About The Little Pilot.

312
00:34:58.848 --> 00:35:00.182
- Which rumor?
- What is that?

313
00:35:00.307 --> 00:35:02.726
Kobayashi is his distant uncle.

314
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.270
He's the mayor's ward.

315
00:35:04.395 --> 00:35:06.564
- What?
- Whoa.

316
00:35:06.689 --> 00:35:08.607
Be that as it may, let's look at the pros.

317
00:35:08.732 --> 00:35:11.347
That boy flew here, all alone,
and crash-landed onto this island

318
00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:15.281
for one reason; one reason only:
to find his dog.

319
00:35:15.406 --> 00:35:18.909
To the best of my knowledge, no other
master, not one single human master,

320
00:35:18.993 --> 00:35:20.828
has made any effort to do that.

321
00:35:20.953 --> 00:35:22.955
They've forgotten all about us.

322
00:35:23.789 --> 00:35:27.042
I propose we start tomorrow, first-light.

323
00:35:27.168 --> 00:35:28.794
<i>We'll cross the Middle Fingers.</i>

324
00:35:28.878 --> 00:35:30.796
<i>We'll find the tugboat on the Dune.</i>

325
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:32.339
<i>We'll go see Jupiter and Oracle.</i>

326
00:35:32.423 --> 00:35:33.799
<i>They'll know what to do.</i>

327
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:37.303
Let's take a vote. All in favor say "Aye".

328
00:35:37.428 --> 00:35:38.679
- Aye.
- Nay.

329
00:35:38.804 --> 00:35:39.805
Who's the nay-sayer?

330
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.932
- Him.
- Me.

331
00:35:42.558 --> 00:35:47.479
That kid is gonna get us all
put to sleep. Euthanized.

332
00:35:47.605 --> 00:35:49.607
We won't find the dog,

333
00:35:50.733 --> 00:35:52.735
but we will die trying.

334
00:35:54.528 --> 00:35:57.573
Not a bad way to go.
You're out-voted, anyway.

335
00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:05.706
<i>Science-Party Candidate Professor Watanabe</i>

336
00:36:05.831 --> 00:36:08.876

Thank you, Editor Hiroshi.

341
00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:41.757
You all know me. I speak my mind,
and sometimes that ruffles some feathers.

342
00:36:41.784 --> 00:36:43.535
Please, forgive my bluntness.

343
00:36:43.661 --> 00:36:46.080
Mayor Kobayashi is a crook, and I hate him.

344
00:36:46.205 --> 00:36:50.292
Right now, he faces a divided congress
during a hotly-contested re-election year.

345
00:36:50.417 --> 00:36:53.295
Dogs are dying on a miserable island.

346
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.798
Gullible masters have been brainwashed.

347
00:36:55.923 --> 00:36:58.384
The Science-Party Candidate
is being held against his will

348
00:36:58.509 --> 00:37:01.136
with no recourse to legal counsel.

349
00:37:01.887 --> 00:37:04.181
Somebody is up to something.

350
00:37:08.352 --> 00:37:10.854
You have a conspiracy theory?

351
00:37:12.773 --> 00:37:14.817
I have a hunch.

352
00:37:16.235 --> 00:37:18.237
I don't print hunch.

353
00:37:20.656 --> 00:37:21.907
Huh?

354
00:37:22.825 --> 00:37:24.827
I'll spell it out.

355
00:37:24.952 --> 00:37:27.079
I believe Municipal Dome propaganda

356
00:37:27.204 --> 00:37:30.249
has deliberately stoked
irrational, Anti-Dog fear

357
00:37:30.374 --> 00:37:33.043
and suppressed a medically
proven Dog-Flu treatment

358
00:37:33.168 --> 00:37:35.129
in order to promote a secret campaign

359
00:37:35.254 --> 00:37:38.924
to turn the country against
its innocent house-pets.

360
00:37:39.049 --> 00:37:41.218
There. I said it.

361
00:37:43.971 --> 00:37:45.889
Can you prove it?

362
00:37:54.315 --> 00:37:56.108
I don't know.

363
00:37:56.191 --> 00:37:58.193
To tell you the truth: I don't know.

364
00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:08.078
<i>I've lost all of my pride</i>

365
00:38:08.495 --> 00:38:13.333
<i>I've been to paradise and out the other side</i>

366
00:38:13.542 --> 00:38:16.295
<i>Part Two: "The Search for Spots."</i>

367
00:38:16.378 --> 00:38:19.882
<i>With no one to guide me</i>

368
00:38:19.965 --> 00:38:24.094
<i>Torn apart by a fiery wheel inside me</i>

369
00:38:27.347 --> 00:38:30.350
<i>An untouched diamond</i>

370
00:38:30.434 --> 00:38:35.230
<i>That's golden and brilliant
without illumination</i>

371
00:38:37.858 --> 00:38:40.736
<i>Your mouth's a constellation</i>

372
00:38:41.445 --> 00:38:44.907
<i>The stars are in your eyes</i>

373
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:50.204
<i>I'll take a spaceship
and try and go and find you</i>

374
00:38:52.915 --> 00:38:56.585
<i>The Middle Fingers of Trash Island
wind and weave up-river,</i>

375
00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:01.048
<i>inter-stitched by zig-zagging
pipe-lines and rusty viaducts.</i>

376
00:39:01.173 --> 00:39:04.843
<i>The ruins of a failed utility-complex
washed-out by tsunami.</i>

377
00:39:04.968 --> 00:39:08.055
<i>The rubble of an abandoned power-plant
demolished by earthquake.</i>

378
00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.851
<i>The remains of a deserted industrial
estate destroyed by volcanic blast.</i>

379
00:39:12.935 --> 00:39:16.438
<i>I won't hurt you I won't hurt you</i>

380
00:39:16.522 --> 00:39:20.067
<i>I won't hurt you I won't hurt you</i>

381
00:39:21.902 --> 00:39:24.238
<i>The Old Trash Island Athletic Club,</i>

382
00:39:24.321 --> 00:39:26.573
<i>member-less and long-forgotten.</i>

383
00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:29.952
Okay, I got a question.
What's your favorite food?

384
00:39:30.077 --> 00:39:31.930
A double-portion of Doggy Chop from the can

385
00:39:31.954 --> 00:39:35.165
mixed into a bowl of broken Puppy Snaps
with a vitamin crushed up into it.

386
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:37.084
King's the spokes-dog for that.

387
00:39:37.167 --> 00:39:38.669
He's the Doggy Chop dog.

388
00:39:38.752 --> 00:39:41.106
- Mmm. Used to be.
- Was that your daily meal?

389
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.941
Not always. My master was a school-teacher.

390
00:39:42.965 --> 00:39:44.758
We weren't rich, you know. You?

391
00:39:44.883 --> 00:39:48.512
A center-cut Kobe rib-eye, seared,
on the bone, with salt and pepper.

392
00:39:48.595 --> 00:39:49.596
Wow.

393
00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.640
It was my birthday supper. Every year.

394
00:39:51.765 --> 00:39:54.226
Mine's hot-sausage, yakitori-style.

395
00:39:54.351 --> 00:39:57.396
The snack vendor always
saved me one on game-days.

396
00:39:57.521 --> 00:39:59.439
- Hmm. Duke?
- Ah, green-tea ice cream.

397
00:39:59.565 --> 00:40:00.983
My master had a sweet-tooth.

398
00:40:01.066 --> 00:40:02.484
I probably inherited it from her.

399
00:40:03.861 --> 00:40:05.904
You heard the rumor, right? About Doggy Chop.

400
00:40:06.029 --> 00:40:07.589
- Remind us again.
- What rumor?

401
00:40:07.698 --> 00:40:10.409
- Oh, they folded.
- Oh, no.

402
00:40:10.534 --> 00:40:13.287
Doggy... Doggy Chop folded?

403
00:40:13.412 --> 00:40:16.540
How about you, Chief?
What was your favorite food?

404
00:40:16.665 --> 00:40:19.042
Me? Oh, I don't care.

405
00:40:19.168 --> 00:40:21.503
Garbage, trash, scraps of rubbish.

406
00:40:21.628 --> 00:40:24.089
- I'm used to left-overs.
- Hmm.

407
00:40:24.214 --> 00:40:25.299
Yeah, yeah.

408
00:40:25.382 --> 00:40:27.843
Of course, I wasn't always a stray.

409
00:40:27.968 --> 00:40:29.553
Wait. What'd you say?

410
00:40:29.636 --> 00:40:31.847
I said I wasn't always a stray.

411
00:40:31.972 --> 00:40:33.974
- Really? Since when?
- Tell us about that.

412
00:40:42.357 --> 00:40:45.110
I've been hunted by dog-catchers all my life.

413
00:40:45.194 --> 00:40:46.445
I'm not easy to trap.

414
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:48.906
I've only got three captures on my record

415
00:40:49.031 --> 00:40:50.908
where I actually got sent
to the pound, I mean,

416
00:40:51.033 --> 00:40:53.952
and the first two times,
I escaped within 24 hours,

417
00:40:54.077 --> 00:40:56.371
but the third time...

418
00:40:56.496 --> 00:41:00.250
I got adopted before I could finish
digging the break-out-tunnel.

419
00:41:00.375 --> 00:41:01.627
It was a big family.

420
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:03.921
Five kids. Two other dogs, already.

421
00:41:04.046 --> 00:41:08.258
They stuck me in the back of a station-wagon
and drove me out to the middle of the sticks.

422
00:41:08.383 --> 00:41:11.970
Grass, trees, swimming pool. Cartoons on TV.

423
00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:15.057
Anyway, one morning a week later,

424
00:41:15.182 --> 00:41:16.934
the youngest boy, his name was Toshiro,

425
00:41:17.059 --> 00:41:20.687
woke me up at 6:15, bright-eyed, wide-awake,

426
00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:24.524
and he tried to pet me.

427
00:41:25.317 --> 00:41:28.487
He didn't mean anything by it.
He was just being friendly.

428
00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:35.494
Apparently, I bit him so hard,
I nearly chewed his hand off.

429
00:41:36.536 --> 00:41:38.747
Blood all over the kitchen floor.

430
00:41:38.872 --> 00:41:41.917
They rushed him to the emergency room
and I got pad-locked out

431
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.585
in the tool-shed with the lights out.

432
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:46.046
It gave me some time to think.

433
00:41:46.171 --> 00:41:49.591
What happened? Why did I do that?

434
00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:52.886
To this day, I have no idea.

435
00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:55.389
I guess he scared me.

436
00:41:57.432 --> 00:41:59.518
I bite.

437
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.106
That night, an old woman,
she must've been the grandmother

438
00:42:04.231 --> 00:42:07.067
brought me out a bowl of some
homemade hibachi-chili.

439
00:42:07.192 --> 00:42:09.820
I like to think she cooked it for me,
personally -but who knows?

440
00:42:09.945 --> 00:42:11.738
Maybe it was just more left-overs. But...

441
00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:13.949
You've got a tick.

442
00:42:16.994 --> 00:42:20.080
Anyway, that's my favorite food I ever ate.

443
00:42:20.205 --> 00:42:22.582
The old woman made a great bowl of chili.

444
00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:25.460
What happened after that?

445
00:42:25.585 --> 00:42:28.547
I dug my way out by morning,
jumped on the back of a dump-truck,

446
00:42:28.672 --> 00:42:30.799
and hitched back to Megasaki.

447
00:42:30.924 --> 00:42:33.885
I was always a street-dog, let's face it.

448
00:42:45.397 --> 00:42:47.399
Somebody's stalking us.

449
00:43:04.124 --> 00:43:06.752
<i>As you know, we all hate dogs.</i>

450
00:43:06.877 --> 00:43:09.942
<i>Chairman Fujimoto-san,
President of Kobayashi Pharmaceutical.</i>

451
00:43:10.005 --> 00:43:12.799
<i>You secretly introduced
mega-quantities of infected fleas</i>

452
00:43:12.924 --> 00:43:15.886
<i>and contagious tick-larvae
into a metropolitan city center,</i>

453
00:43:16.011 --> 00:43:19.181
<i>creating an unprecedented
animal-disease out-break.</i>

454
00:43:19.306 --> 00:43:20.307
<i>Thank you.</i>

455
00:43:20.432 --> 00:43:23.935
<i>General Yamatachi-san, Commander
of the Megasaki Municipal Task force.</i>

456
00:43:24.061 --> 00:43:28.023
<i>You oversaw the deportation
of over 750,000 caged-animals</i>

457
00:43:28.148 --> 00:43:31.193
<i>to a nearly uninhabitable
off-shore refuse-center.</i>

458
00:43:31.318 --> 00:43:32.402
<i>Good work.</i>

459
00:43:32.527 --> 00:43:35.655
<i>Supervisor Kitano-san,
Director of Kobayashi Robotics.</i>

460
00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:37.866
<i>You developed the most
promising artificial life-form</i>

461
00:43:37.991 --> 00:43:41.953
<i>in the history of corporate-technology,
and a powerful new weapon, to boot.</i>

462
00:43:42.079 --> 00:43:43.288
<i>Well done.</i>

463
00:43:43.413 --> 00:43:46.291
<i>Yakuza Nakamura-san,
Head of the Clenched-Fist Gang.</i>

464
00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:49.586
<i>You eliminated all Pro-Dog opposition
through the use of bribery,</i>

465
00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:52.339
<i>extortion, intimidation, and violent force.</i>

466
00:43:52.464 --> 00:43:54.466
<i>My compliments.</i>

467
00:43:55.967 --> 00:43:59.054
<i>Brains have been washed.
Wheels have been greased.</i>

468
00:43:59.179 --> 00:44:00.597
<i>Fear has been mongered.</i>

469
00:44:00.722 --> 00:44:03.433
<i>Now we prepare for the final stage
of our conspiracy-theory:</i>

470
00:44:03.558 --> 00:44:06.853
<i>the permanent end
to the Canine Saturation-Crisis.</i>

471
00:44:16.988 --> 00:44:20.117
<i>We believe we've recovered
a viable DNA sample</i>

472
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.702
<i>from this article
of damaged aviation equipment.</i>

473
00:44:23.537 --> 00:44:26.540
<i>We're going to check it right now
if you care to observe.</i>

474
00:44:49.187 --> 00:44:53.483
We call upon dog-lovers everywhere
to harken to this transmission:

475
00:44:55.485 --> 00:44:56.645
May-day! May-day!

476
00:44:56.862 --> 00:45:00.574
Unscheduled Junior Turbo-Prop
in severe distress over Sapporo River.

477
00:45:00.699 --> 00:45:03.785
Engine-failure, and detachment of left wing.

478
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.955
Will attempt emergency-landing
on Trash Island coast.

479
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.999
Please, make note of the following:

480
00:45:09.124 --> 00:45:12.878
<i>to my security-detail / bodyguard-dog,
Spots Kobayashi, if still living,</i>

481
00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:15.881
<i>I leave all my worldly possessions.</i>

482
00:45:16.298 --> 00:45:20.135
<i>If Spots has preceded me into
the next life, I ask that everything,</i>

483
00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:22.762
<i>including my own bones and Spots' carcass,</i>

484
00:45:22.888 --> 00:45:25.599
<i>be burned in a crematory furnace,</i>

485
00:45:25.724 --> 00:45:28.226
<i>with our ashes scattered to the four-winds.</i>

486
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:31.438
<i>It will not amount to much
pollution in this sad land.</i>

487
00:45:31.563 --> 00:45:34.274
<i>If I survive, ignore this message.</i>

488
00:45:35.275 --> 00:45:37.277
<i>I've gone to find my dog.</i>

489
00:45:38.278 --> 00:45:41.656
Young masters of Megasaki: unite!

490
00:45:52.375 --> 00:45:54.085
Turpentine brandy.

491
00:45:54.169 --> 00:45:57.672
It cools the head and warms the dog-bones.

492
00:45:59.966 --> 00:46:01.968
It may snow tonight.

493
00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:05.138
Really? Thank you very much. Wow.

494
00:46:05.263 --> 00:46:07.265
To whom it may concern.

495
00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:11.478
- She sees the future.
- No.

496
00:46:11.603 --> 00:46:13.605
She understands T.V.

497
00:46:18.443 --> 00:46:21.571
You seek a dog named Spots.

498
00:46:25.825 --> 00:46:28.495
- Dog-Zero.
- Dog-Zero.

499
00:46:30.956 --> 00:46:33.416
As you know,
most of the animals on this island

500
00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:37.003
come from human homes
with domesticated back-grounds.

501
00:46:37.128 --> 00:46:40.548
However, a small population
of savage, aboriginal dogs

502
00:46:40.674 --> 00:46:44.886
have been scavenging the Metropolitan
Dumping-Grounds for nearly a decade.

503
00:46:45.011 --> 00:46:47.514
The graffiti on this wall depicts the story.

504
00:46:47.973 --> 00:46:50.183
They were born into captivity
on the ends of the fringes

505
00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:52.143
of the most distant reaches of the island.

506
00:46:52.227 --> 00:46:55.146
They endured great suffering and cruelty

507
00:46:55.271 --> 00:46:57.607
at the hands of their former masters.

508
00:46:57.732 --> 00:47:00.860
Finally, in the wake of
an Act of God, they escaped-

509
00:47:00.986 --> 00:47:03.613
to a harsh and desperate freedom.

510
00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:07.993
<i>Some say they died away over the
subsequent years, starving and forgotten.</i>

511
00:47:08.326 --> 00:47:11.809
<i>Some say they swam to the mainland,
but this seems unlikely.</i>

512
00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:13.707
<i>Too far to dog-paddle.</i>

513
00:47:13.832 --> 00:47:15.208
<i>Some say they're still with us,</i>

514
00:47:15.333 --> 00:47:19.129
<i>in the Far-away Cuticles,
beyond the Middle Fingers.</i>

515
00:47:19.713 --> 00:47:22.048
We know the animal you seek.

516
00:47:22.757 --> 00:47:25.051
<i>He has appeared in Oracle's visions.</i>

517
00:47:27.387 --> 00:47:29.806
A prophecy suggests itself:

518
00:47:31.558 --> 00:47:34.352
Spots, if he's alive,
may very well be living,

519
00:47:34.477 --> 00:47:37.188
even at this moment, as a captive prisoner

520
00:47:37.313 --> 00:47:40.942
abducted into the company
of these wild, savage dogs.

521
00:47:41.985 --> 00:47:43.486
Oracle, what do you think?

522
00:47:45.864 --> 00:47:47.615
What?

523
00:47:49.534 --> 00:47:53.121
Continue your journey.
Have faith in your cause.

524
00:47:53.246 --> 00:47:55.665
Luck and good fortune be unto you.

525
00:47:59.294 --> 00:48:02.505
You heard the rumor, right?
About these aboriginal dogs.

526
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:04.924
- Remind me again.
- What's the rumor?

527
00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:07.052
Uh, they're cannibals.

528
00:48:07.177 --> 00:48:10.472
So you're telling me
they're going to want to eat us?

529
00:48:10.597 --> 00:48:12.599
Well, they're cannibals.

530
00:50:51.633 --> 00:50:53.509
We're approaching
the end of Old Trash Island.

531
00:50:53.635 --> 00:50:56.512
To the west: the Sapporo River
and Megasaki City.

532
00:50:56.638 --> 00:50:58.240
To the east: the open-sea.

533
00:50:58.264 --> 00:51:01.559
To the north: a long, rickety
cause-way over a noxious sludge-marsh

534
00:51:01.684 --> 00:51:05.146
leading to a radio-active land-fill
polluted by toxic chemical-garbage.

535
00:51:05.271 --> 00:51:06.665
- That's our destination.
- Great.

536
00:51:06.689 --> 00:51:08.149
- Got it.
- Get ready to jump.

537
00:51:08.274 --> 00:51:11.086
I'm going to drag you overboard with my
teeth, since you can't understand the plan.

538
00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:12.612
After that, we're back on foot.

539
00:51:12.695 --> 00:51:13.780
The next stage...

540
00:51:13.905 --> 00:51:15.073
Where'd they...

541
00:51:15.156 --> 00:51:16.383
Where'd they go?

542
00:51:16.407 --> 00:51:17.509
What are they doing over there?

543
00:51:17.533 --> 00:51:18.576
How did this happen?

544
00:51:18.701 --> 00:51:20.662
What's going on with this contraption?

545
00:51:20.787 --> 00:51:22.747
If we get separated, which we are:

546
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:25.667
rendez-vous at the cause-way!

547
00:51:25.792 --> 00:51:28.336
- You're not our leader!
- What?

548
00:51:28.461 --> 00:51:30.630
You're not our leader! We all are!

549
00:51:30.713 --> 00:51:32.173
Let's take a vote!

550
00:51:34.175 --> 00:51:37.845
All in favor of my plan,
which is to rendez-vous at the cause-way...

551
00:52:14.757 --> 00:52:16.759
Let's go.

552
00:52:26.853 --> 00:52:28.813
No, you can't ride the Pagoda-Slide.

553
00:52:28.938 --> 00:52:31.607
You're below the safety-limit,
anyway. Let's go.

554
00:52:35.695 --> 00:52:39.449
We made an emergency plan, even if we
didn't get to vote and agree to it yet:

555
00:52:39.574 --> 00:52:43.077
rendez-vous at the cause-way to the
Far-away Cuticles, and go find your dog.

556
00:52:43.202 --> 00:52:46.539
Maybe everybody else just got crushed,
compacted, and incinerated,

557
00:52:46.664 --> 00:52:48.666
but we're going to be there. Let's go.

558
00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:57.508
Don't.

559
00:52:58.885 --> 00:53:00.303
Repeat:

560
00:53:02.096 --> 00:53:04.057
don't.

561
00:53:07.727 --> 00:53:09.896
I am not your pet. I never liked you.

562
00:53:10.021 --> 00:53:12.148
I don't care about you. I won't wait for you.

563
00:53:12.648 --> 00:53:14.650
I bite.

564
00:53:17.487 --> 00:53:18.905
Good luck.

565
00:54:02.073 --> 00:54:05.034
Jerks. Come here. Oh, do this. Do that.

566
00:54:05.159 --> 00:54:07.328
Our Masters. I'll do what I...

567
00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:10.790
Hmm...

568
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:55.835
I suppose if it was working right,
we'd be dead already.

569
00:55:13.728 --> 00:55:15.813
Don't ask me to fetch that stick.

570
00:55:20.526 --> 00:55:21.861
Fetch-i!

571
00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:29.160
Fetch-i!

572
00:55:29.285 --> 00:55:32.788
I'm telling you: I don't fetch.

573
00:55:38.294 --> 00:55:40.296
Fetch-i!

574
00:55:41.339 --> 00:55:44.634
I'm not doing this because
you commanded me to.

575
00:55:44.759 --> 00:55:47.970
I'm doing it- because I feel sorry for you.

576
00:56:01.442 --> 00:56:03.444
Good boy.

577
00:56:41.941 --> 00:56:43.317
Where'd you get that dog?

578
00:56:43.401 --> 00:56:45.403
He looks like me with a pink nose.

579
00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:50.408
I come from a nine-dog litter,
but they drowned the sisters.

580
00:56:50.533 --> 00:56:53.494
We're not a rare breed:
short-haired-Oceanic- speckled-ear/

581
00:56:53.577 --> 00:56:54.787
sport-hound-mix.

582
00:56:54.912 --> 00:56:57.164
I'm getting confused now.

583
00:56:57.248 --> 00:56:59.333
My belly feels funny.

584
00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:14.682
Biscuit-o.

585
00:57:16.559 --> 00:57:20.479
I can't accept that. It's for your dog.

586
00:57:25.693 --> 00:57:27.903
I've never been offered
a Puppy Snap in my life.

587
00:57:28.028 --> 00:57:30.197
I don't even know what they taste like.

588
00:57:30.322 --> 00:57:31.574
Okay, I'll try it.

589
00:57:33.743 --> 00:57:36.495
Crunchy. Salty.

590
00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.582
Supposedly, it cleans your teeth.

591
00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:43.252
This is my new favorite food.

592
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.338
Thank you.

593
00:57:50.509 --> 00:57:54.138
<i>My pale blue star</i>

594
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:59.351
<i>My rainbow, how good it is
to know you're like me</i>

595
00:58:02.104 --> 00:58:05.357
<i>Strike me with your lightning</i>

596
00:58:05.441 --> 00:58:10.613
<i>Bring me down and bury me with ashes</i>

597
00:58:18.412 --> 00:58:22.041
<i>I won't hurt you I won't hurt you</i>

598
00:58:22.124 --> 00:58:26.086
<i>I won't hurt you I won't hurt you</i>

599
00:58:36.013 --> 00:58:38.015
Cold up here tonight.

600
00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:42.186
We'll find him.

601
00:58:42.269 --> 00:58:46.315
Wherever he is, if he's alive:
we'll find your dog.

602
00:58:47.733 --> 00:58:51.237
<i>I won't hurt you I won't hurt you</i>

603
00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:54.865
<i>I won't hurt you I won't hurt you</i>

604
00:58:54.949 --> 00:58:58.577
<i>I won't hurt you I won't hurt you</i>

605
00:59:08.087 --> 00:59:11.257
Mayor Kobayashi,
elected leader of Megasaki City.

606
00:59:11.382 --> 00:59:14.009
For 150 years, you and your ancestors,

607
00:59:14.093 --> 00:59:18.055
known as the Kobayashi Dynasty,
a procession of dog-hating thugs,

608
00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.641
stooges, felons,
and their criminal underlings,

609
00:59:20.766 --> 00:59:24.103
have betrayed and deceived
the citizens of Uni Prefecture.

610
00:59:24.853 --> 00:59:27.273
You make me so mad!

611
00:59:28.566 --> 00:59:32.361
Professor Watanabe,
Science-Party Candidate, deceased.

612
00:59:32.486 --> 00:59:34.363
The wasabi in your blood showed poison-levels

613
00:59:34.488 --> 00:59:39.034
in excess of ten times the maximum dosage
required to stop the heart of a whale.

614
00:59:39.159 --> 00:59:41.870
Why'd you do it?

615
00:59:43.163 --> 00:59:47.001
Atari Kobayashi, adopted ward
to the mayoral-household.

616
00:59:47.126 --> 00:59:51.672
You heroically hi-jacked
a Junior Turbo-Prop XJ750

617
00:59:51.797 --> 00:59:54.258
and flew it to the island...

618
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.569
Atari.

619
01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:15.112
You heroically, as I was saying,

620
01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:19.325
stole the little airplane,
because of your dog and...

621
01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:22.244
I lost my train of thought.

622
01:00:23.412 --> 01:00:24.830
Dammit!

623
01:00:25.664 --> 01:00:27.666
I've got a crush on you.

624
01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:32.171
<i>Part Three: "The Rendez-Vous."</i>

625
01:00:58.197 --> 01:01:01.533
Rex! King! Duke! Boss! You made it!

626
01:01:02.201 --> 01:01:05.287
- What happened to you?
- I took a bath.

627
01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:08.832
- What? He's got soap?
- Just a little.

628
01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:11.001
You're too fluffy.

629
01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.337
- We played fetch.
- With a stick?

630
01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:15.464
With a hunk of rubber radiator-tubing.

631
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:17.383
And you brought it back to him?

632
01:01:17.508 --> 01:01:19.176
Yeah.

633
01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:20.469
He's a good boy.

634
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:24.390
Don't you tell me that!

635
01:01:24.515 --> 01:01:27.685
I'm the one that tried to make you
be loyal to him, in the first place.

636
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:29.645
Stop. Stop! This is the rendezvous.

637
01:01:29.728 --> 01:01:31.563
Where's that trash-tram taking you?

638
01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:33.583
You think we booked this ride
through a travel agent?

639
01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.919
We were fighting for our lives
in a high-velocity trash-processor

640
01:01:35.943 --> 01:01:37.663
while you were getting scrubbed and brushed.

641
01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:39.530
- Jump!
- Where?

642
01:01:39.655 --> 01:01:41.615
- Here!
- When?

643
01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.742
- Now!
- Why?

644
01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.953
- What?
- Let's take a vote.

645
01:01:46.078 --> 01:01:48.080
All in favor of jump...

646
01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:57.464
Who's that?

647
01:02:05.431 --> 01:02:07.224
I can't smell him.

648
01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:50.934
<i>Come in.</i>

649
01:02:51.018 --> 01:02:52.245
<i>Master Atari... Can you hear me?</i>

650
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.312
Huh?

651
01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:17.419
That dog's real.

652
01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:26.053
What's that thing in your ear for?

653
01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:27.471
Are you hard of hearing?

654
01:03:27.596 --> 01:03:28.931
You can't be. Um...

655
01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:32.392
Bodyguard-dogs have to have
20/30-Auditory just to be certified.

656
01:03:32.768 --> 01:03:35.789
No, the ear-piece is how I receive
my commands and instructions and so on.

657
01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:38.690
Obviously, I'm privy to
certain sensitive information

658
01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.693
due to my position in the
mayoral-household at Brick Mansion.

659
01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:45.405
Oh, so you mean somebody could
be talking to you right now?

660
01:03:45.531 --> 01:03:49.243
Well, the range is only about
75 feet or so, I guess, so...

661
01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:50.608
Battery's probably dead, anyway.

662
01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:51.828
I got a question for you.

663
01:03:51.954 --> 01:03:54.039
How much money do you think the mayor makes?

664
01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.541
I can't tell you that.

665
01:03:55.624 --> 01:03:57.668
That's highly confidential.

666
01:03:57.793 --> 01:03:59.962
Um, anyway, I'm not
the mayor's accountant's dog.

667
01:04:00.087 --> 01:04:04.108
That's Butterscotch, and she got crushed in
a glass compactor the day before yesterday.

668
01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:07.302
No, my duties are, uh, focused entirely

669
01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:09.846
on the protection of the mayor's ward, Atari.

670
01:04:09.972 --> 01:04:13.183
I'm not supposed to be his friend,
but I love him very much,

671
01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:15.269
but that's a private matter.

672
01:04:15.394 --> 01:04:16.812
Um, the only reason I even said that

673
01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:19.565
was because we're all probably
going to die out here

674
01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:22.484
and I'll never see him again.

675
01:04:27.114 --> 01:04:28.532
That's a tough break.

676
01:04:28.657 --> 01:04:32.369
Well, good luck to you
and watch out for the cannibal-dogs.

677
01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:35.330
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

678
01:04:35.664 --> 01:04:37.833
- What?
- What?

679
01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:41.253
- Watch out for the...?
- The cannibal-dogs.

680
01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:44.673
- They are dogs that eat dogs.
- Start over and repeat again.

681
01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:46.842
You know what? Don't even worry about that.

682
01:04:46.967 --> 01:04:50.539
I just heard there might be some wild,
aboriginal, cannibal-dogs in the area,

683
01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.992
you know, but I wouldn't worry because
you're in an extra-security lock cell.

684
01:04:54.266 --> 01:04:55.267
Look at it that way.

685
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.561
You're probably safer than I am.

686
01:04:57.686 --> 01:04:59.688
Except from thirst and starvation.

687
01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:37.476
It's got an extra-security lock on it.

688
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.186
You'll never get it open.

689
01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:16.473
Are you going to eat me now?

690
01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:19.559
What did you say?

691
01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:21.353
Are you going to eat me now?

692
01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:22.813
I heard you were cannibal-dogs.

693
01:06:22.938 --> 01:06:27.859
Be notified: I'll be compelled to defend
myself with all means at my disposal.

694
01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:35.409
Hmm.

695
01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:39.162
Who told you that dirty lie?

696
01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.963
We resorted to cannibalism on one occasion,

697
01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:50.924
many months ago,
as a desperate survival instinct.

698
01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:53.718
We ate one single dog.

699
01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:56.930
His name was Fuzzball,
and he was the leader of our pack,

700
01:06:57.055 --> 01:06:59.182
and he was already in a coma from starvation,

701
01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:04.896
so we put him out of his... his...

702
01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:11.069
His misery and...

703
01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:14.281
And...

704
01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:18.660
Consumed him.

705
01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:31.756
We would have dropped dead in a week
or less without that nourishment.

706
01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:34.801
We were dying. Do you judge us for that?

707
01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:36.887
Shame on you!

708
01:07:37.012 --> 01:07:40.015
We only brought you here
in the first place to help you.

709
01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.607
We've got a Master Pass-Key!

710
01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:50.734
Open his cage.

711
01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:07.167
Fuzzball was his best friend.

712
01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:18.762
Oh, dear. Uh, I think I offended him.

713
01:08:18.887 --> 01:08:21.598
I'm truly sorry. I had no idea.

714
01:08:23.058 --> 01:08:26.269
What is this place?
How long have you been here?

715
01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:28.396
I can see you've been mistreated.

716
01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:35.070
Are you okay?

717
01:08:36.905 --> 01:08:40.367
My name is Spots. Spots Kobayashi.

718
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.620
How can I be of service to you?

719
01:08:46.164 --> 01:08:48.542
Master Atari-san, can you hear me?

720
01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:50.252
Can you hear me, Master Atari?

721
01:08:50.377 --> 01:08:51.628
Spots-u?

722
01:08:51.753 --> 01:08:52.879
You're not safe here!

723
01:08:52.963 --> 01:08:54.163
You shouldn't have come for me!

724
01:08:54.214 --> 01:08:55.674
I can't protect you efficiently

725
01:08:55.757 --> 01:08:56.883
under these conditions!

726
01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:09.145
Spots-u!

727
01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:12.190
<i>Here I come.</i>

728
01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:29.916
Sic-'em!

729
01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:35.130
<i>Follow me!</i>

730
01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:49.078
All in favor of kicking Chief out of the pack

731
01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:51.146
and never speaking to him again, say "Aye".

732
01:09:51.271 --> 01:09:52.981
Aye!

733
01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:58.570
- How did you do that?
- Secret tooth! Military issue!

734
01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:02.824
Technically, I could do it 37 more times,
but I wouldn't be able to chew my meat!

735
01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:06.411
I assume you're Spots!
We've been looking for you.

736
01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:15.879
Master Atari-san,

737
01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:18.340
I swore an oath when I assumed
the responsibilities

738
01:10:18.465 --> 01:10:20.967
of official bodyguard-dog
to the mayoral-household!

739
01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:24.262
I could never be persuaded to break
that vow for any reason whatsoever!

740
01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:27.390
I'll always be loyal to you
as my only and unconditional master!

741
01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:32.228
But circumstances have radically changed
for me and all the pets of Megasaki City!

742
01:10:32.354 --> 01:10:34.606
I have new obligations
which I never anticipated!

743
01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:38.443
I've become the leader of a tribe of outcasts
who depend on me for their survival,

744
01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:41.863
and I'm going to be a father!

745
01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:44.199
With deepest sadness and humility:

746
01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:49.079
I must ask you to relieve me of the duties
of my position, effective immediately.

747
01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:51.498
You son of a bitch.

748
01:10:51.623 --> 01:10:53.875
If we don't drown, I'm going
to strangle you myself.

749
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.295
I don't care how many exploding teeth
you try to spit-out at me.

750
01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:02.342
Do you have any idea what that Little Pilot
just went through to try to rescue you?

751
01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:03.551
How dare you?

752
01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:08.640
- You're a stray.
- Yeah, so what?

753
01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:10.767
What's your name?

754
01:11:10.892 --> 01:11:12.102
Who cares?

755
01:11:12.227 --> 01:11:15.230
You're from central Megasaki.
I can tell by the accent.

756
01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:18.191
You're a short-haired-Oceanic-
speckle-ear/sport-hound-mix.

757
01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:22.654
You were born in a storm-sewer
on Bamboo-shoot Holiday six years ago today.

758
01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:24.114
Do you know me?

759
01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:27.409
I... I don't... I don't know.

760
01:11:27.534 --> 01:11:29.953
I'm your older brother by five minutes.

761
01:11:30.078 --> 01:11:32.163
It's been a long time, Chief.

762
01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:36.668
Was... Was I the runt?

763
01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:39.921
Not anymore.

764
01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:52.475
<i>Security-camera footage
confirms initial-reports</i>

765
01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.186
<i>of the deaths of mayoral-ward Atari Kobayashi</i>

766
01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.313
and his five dog-abductors this afternoon

767
01:11:57.439 --> 01:12:00.942
in a sluice channel at the threshold
of the Far-Away Cuticles.

768
01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:03.695
A statement from Major-Domo,
live at Brick Mansion:

769
01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:08.825
The life of a promising young orphan

770
01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.743
has been cut short before its prime.

771
01:12:10.869 --> 01:12:13.288
This is a distant-uncle's worst nightmare.

772
01:12:13.413 --> 01:12:16.833
Mayor Kobayashi asks for your
prayers, your condolences

773
01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:18.686
and your support
for the diligent men and women

774
01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:21.254
of the Municipal Task Force
Dog-Catchers Division:

775
01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:24.090
we salute you for your bravery
and your ongoing commitment

776
01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:27.260
to the continuing punishment of all bad-dogs.

777
01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:37.580
Originally, before the volcano erupted
and an earthquake triggered the tsunami

778
01:12:37.604 --> 01:12:41.560
which obliterated the facility, there were
over 250 incarcerated animals here

779
01:12:41.641 --> 01:12:44.402
on the premises being experimented
on against their will.

780
01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:46.422
If you look closely, you may
notice some of these dogs

781
01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:49.699
still bear scars and markings
from the research and abuse.

782
01:12:51.326 --> 01:12:53.661
Actually, it's pretty obvious.

783
01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:55.288
This is my mate, Peppermint.

784
01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:56.831
She's pregnant with our first litter.

785
01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.583
She was due a week ago.

786
01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:04.899
Anyway, the survivors
of the disaster learned to cultiv...

787
01:13:04.923 --> 01:13:06.674
What's he got there? What's he got there?

788
01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:09.844
Biscuit-o. Biscuit-o. Biscuit-o.

789
01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:12.639
Puppy Snaps.

790
01:13:12.764 --> 01:13:15.391
I heard they don't even make them anymore.

791
01:13:15.517 --> 01:13:16.935
You heard the rumor, right?

792
01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:18.162
About Kobayashi Pharmaceutical.

793
01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:19.771
- I never heard it.
- What rumor?

794
01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:21.773
They invented Dog-Flu.

795
01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:24.317
- No.
- Of course.

796
01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:25.735
That makes sense.

797
01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:27.153
Where do you get all these rumors?

798
01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:28.655
I mean, who tells them to you?

799
01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:29.739
I don't know. Anybody.

800
01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:31.908
Dogs talk, and I listen. Always have.

801
01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:33.785
I, uh, love gossip.

802
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:34.994
Spots!

803
01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:38.998
The black owl has a message.

804
01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:46.548
He's come from all the way across the island.

805
01:13:46.673 --> 01:13:48.675
Get him a cup of sewer-water, Chico.

806
01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.385
Mmm-hmm.

807
01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:51.511
Mmm-hmm.

808
01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:53.513
Yes. We understand.

809
01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:55.848
He has news from the
Metropolitan Dumping-Grounds.

810
01:13:55.974 --> 01:13:58.268
- Metropolitan...
- Shh! Quiet, please.

811
01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:02.939
We're listening, owl. Tell us your message.

812
01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:09.988
He's going to poison us.

813
01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:13.992
Re-election Night: at the moment
Mayor Kobayashi is re-inaugurated,

814
01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:17.620
he'll give the order,
and the extermination-process will begin.

815
01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:19.914
<i>Oracle saw the plan in her visions.</i>

816
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:24.794
<i>If the voters choose me again
on Re-Election Night,</i>

817
01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:28.881
<i>I promise: a final and permanent end
to the Canine Saturation-Crisis.</i>

818
01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:34.304
<i>Every pet in the Trash Island Camp will die.</i>

819
01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:37.307
<i>It may be too late, already;
but, if the black owl reaches you</i>

820
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:38.641
<i>with this message in time:</i>

821
01:14:40.602 --> 01:14:43.855
Go to Megasaki City. Find our masters.

822
01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.525
Appeal to the people. Stop the mayor.

823
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.235
Save us.

824
01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:56.909
We're crossing the river tonight.

825
01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:58.911
Begin preparations immediately.

826
01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.048
You'll meet a bitch named Nutmeg.

827
01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:14.052
Tell her Chief says:
I'll see you in Megasaki.

828
01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:45.685
Hmm.

829
01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:47.770
Beautiful night.

830
01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:51.232
- Peppermint's in labor.
- Oh.

831
01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.527
Come sit beside me.

832
01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:57.530
It's okay.

833
01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.868
Master Atari, are you willing
to accept my brother Chief

834
01:17:01.993 --> 01:17:04.287
as new bodyguard-dog
in personal service to you,

835
01:17:04.412 --> 01:17:06.581
former ward to the mayoral-household?

836
01:17:27.101 --> 01:17:31.063
Chief, are you willing to accept
Atari as your direct master,

837
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:33.941
to serve and protect his safety and welfare

838
01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:36.611
with all courage, loyalty and friendship?

839
01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:43.117
I can do that.

840
01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:45.161
Good.

841
01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.353
Chocolate milk, cold.

842
01:18:57.316 --> 01:19:00.069
Tracy Walker, Megasaki
Senior High, Daily-Manifesto.

843
01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:04.365
Are you Professor Watanabe's
former Assistant-Scientist, Yoko-ono-san?

844
01:19:19.797 --> 01:19:21.799
Do I have it?

845
01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:26.971
Too late.

846
01:19:31.726 --> 01:19:33.477
Do I have it?

847
01:19:33.603 --> 01:19:35.021
Too late.

848
01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:38.441
Nobody care.

849
01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:43.446
Do I have it? Do I have the story?

850
01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:45.031
Yes or no? On the record!

851
01:19:45.156 --> 01:19:46.699
I am sorry for your loss,

852
01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:49.243
but we both know: that was no suicide!

853
01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:51.913
I need to prove my conspiracy-theory!

854
01:19:53.247 --> 01:19:57.752
Ben is dead. No future on Trash Island.

855
01:19:57.877 --> 01:19:59.879
I am failure.

856
01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:04.967
Pull yourself together
and act like a scientist!

857
01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:12.516
Professor Watanabe never gave up.

858
01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:26.572
Is this... Is this the serum?

859
01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:29.283
The Dog-Flu cure? The Snout-fever treatment?

860
01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:32.161
The end of the Canine Saturation-Crisis?

861
01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:34.288
Last dose.

862
01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:38.626
Tracy:

863
01:20:39.919 --> 01:20:41.087
be careful.

864
01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:45.424
<i>Part Four: "Atari's Lantern."</i>

865
01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:46.676
<i>Not fair!</i>

866
01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:48.177
To dogs!

867
01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:50.388
- Not fair!
- To dogs!

868
01:20:50.513 --> 01:20:53.099
- Not fair!
- To dogs!

869
01:21:01.691 --> 01:21:04.318
There will never be a place
for Dog-Flu in Megasaki City.

870
01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:08.030
There will never be room
for Snout-fever in Uni Prefecture.

871
01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.574
<i>The time has come to put
the violent, intimidating,</i>

872
01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:14.078
<i>unsanitary bad-dogs of Trash Island
humanely to sleep.</i>

873
01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:17.915
<i>For their own good; and also: ours.</i>

874
01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.043
<i>General Yamatachi?
Bring out the replacement-pet.</i>

875
01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:27.466
Sit-o!

876
01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:31.429
The results are in!

877
01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:34.974
Stand by for the incoming
Re-Election Night tally!

878
01:21:42.732 --> 01:21:46.569
<i>That crook! He's stealing
the re-election again! Let's go!</i>

879
01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:01.751
<i>This landslide re-election
is a massive fraud,</i>

880
01:22:01.876 --> 01:22:04.086
<i>and we demand a re-count!</i>

881
01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:11.051
Respect-o.

882
01:22:11.719 --> 01:22:15.181
The mayor is allowing the unauthorized
Pro-Dog student-protestors

883
01:22:15.306 --> 01:22:17.558
a platform to voice their dissenting beliefs!

884
01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:21.604
<i>Mayor Kobayashi has dog's-blood
on his hands! You all do!</i>

885
01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:24.565
<i>Atari was a hero.</i>

886
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:27.026
<i>Professor Watanabe was murdered.</i>

887
01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:28.819
The serum works!

888
01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:33.574
<i>The mayor is a crook, and I hate him.</i>

889
01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:42.917
This small minority of dog-lovers has been
sent by overseas special-interest groups

890
01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:45.753
to agitate disorder and incite anarchy.

891
01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:49.202
I hereby cancel and nullify
Foreign-exchange student Walker's

892
01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:50.466
<i>senior high school study-visa.</i>

893
01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:54.362
<i>She will be expelled from class,
stripped of her course-credits,</i>

894
01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:56.514
<i>and formally deported
on the next direct-flight</i>

895
01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:58.077
- <i>back to Cincinnati, Ohio.</i>
- Oh. Hmm.

896
01:23:04.522 --> 01:23:08.442
Mayor Kobayashi has directed Major-Domo
to bring him the red button.

897
01:23:23.916 --> 01:23:25.668
Nutmeg!

898
01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:22.766
Holy smokes! My lungs feel clear.

899
01:24:22.892 --> 01:24:25.185
My equilibrium feels balanced.

900
01:24:25.311 --> 01:24:28.981
My vision is sharp as a tack
for the first time in months.

901
01:24:32.359 --> 01:24:34.945
Wow, that's a great serum!

902
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.080
Master Atari, whose death,
I think we can say,

903
01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:41.076
appears to have been inaccurately reported,

904
01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.846
has asked to read a statement
to the General Assembly.

905
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:46.790
He will then withdraw from the debate
and respond to no further questions.

906
01:24:51.962 --> 01:24:55.633
Dear Editor Hiroshi of the Megasaki
Senior High Daily-Manifesto:

907
01:24:55.758 --> 01:25:00.971
in a series of first-rate articles by
an attractive cub-reporter on your staff,

908
01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.575
you shine a spot-light on the great
injustice that has occurred

909
01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:05.684
under the Kobayashi Administration.

910
01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:07.686
I have spent much of my time in recent weeks

911
01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:10.147
traveling in the company
of the very kind of animals

912
01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:12.399
our mayor refers to as "bad-dogs."

913
01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:15.027
They are the finest living-beings
I have ever come to know

914
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.570
in all my dozen years on this earth.

915
01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:18.948
To your readers, the good people of Megasaki,

916
01:25:19.073 --> 01:25:22.993
I say: the cycle of life
always hangs in a delicate balance.

917
01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:25.454
Who are we, and who do we want to be?

918
01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:28.123
Who are we?

919
01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:34.564
I wrote a haiku to try to express my feelings

920
01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:36.757
about the suffering dogs of Trash Island.

921
01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:39.176
It is also about nature, love,

922
01:25:39.259 --> 01:25:42.012
friendship, eternity, and a black owl.

923
01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:44.765
I call it: Atari's Lantern.

924
01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:28.851
He said a haiku.

925
01:26:28.934 --> 01:26:31.812
I'll tell you later.

926
01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:37.568
I dedicate this poem to
my distant-uncle, Mayor Kobayashi,

927
01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:42.406
who took me in when I myself was
a stray-dog with nowhere else to turn.

928
01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:45.492
Editor Hiroshi, please extend
my subscription for an additional year.

929
01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:48.162
I enclose a check in the amount
of one thousand yen.

930
01:26:48.287 --> 01:26:52.833
Signed, Atari Kobayashi,
former ward to the mayoral-household.

931
01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:56.795
Hmm.

932
01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:13.062
Not-fair-to-the-boy.

933
01:27:16.607 --> 01:27:18.067
Not-fair-to-the-dog.

934
01:27:20.652 --> 01:27:23.447
He says: "I-have-no-honor."

935
01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:32.414
Hmm?

936
01:27:42.508 --> 01:27:44.218
Holy Moses!

937
01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:47.679
The mayor has just officially
unstamped the Trash Island Decree!

938
01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:49.807
No kidding!

939
01:27:56.772 --> 01:28:00.567
Major-Domo is accusing the mayor
of breaking his campaign promise!

940
01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:02.236
He's steaming mad!

941
01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:11.245
It's gonna be a fight!

942
01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:19.419
- Spit him with a tooth!
- I can't get a clean shot.

943
01:28:19.545 --> 01:28:22.798
Too many innocent protesters.
I'll be right back.

944
01:29:20.564 --> 01:29:22.441
Escape!

945
01:29:22.566 --> 01:29:23.692
Escape! Escape!

946
01:29:23.817 --> 01:29:25.319
Escape!

947
01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:04.250
But, what about the right one?

948
01:31:03.959 --> 01:31:06.878
<i>According to a long-standing
statute unique to Uni Prefecture,</i>

949
01:31:07.004 --> 01:31:09.440
<i>in the event of the death,
disappearance, or felony-prosecution</i>

950
01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:12.009
<i>of the chosen candidate
on, while, during, or concurrent</i>

951
01:31:12.092 --> 01:31:14.803
<i>with the Re-Election-Night ceremony,
all powers and authorities</i>

952
01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:17.973
<i>vested in his or her designated office
transfer forthwith to his or her</i>

953
01:31:18.056 --> 01:31:19.891
<i>next-of-kin and/or appointed heir.</i>

954
01:31:20.017 --> 01:31:24.813
In other words, Atari Kobayashi is
the new mayor of Megasaki City!

955
01:31:25.439 --> 01:31:29.568
<i>You heard me right: Atari Kobayashi
is the new mayor of Megasaki City!</i>

956
01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:31.862
<i>Let's hope that new kidney works.</i>

957
01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:35.574
Boy, what a night!

958
01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:43.749
<i>Life in Uni Prefecture returned
to a comfortable tranquility.</i>

959
01:31:43.874 --> 01:31:46.668
<i>The Megasaki Dragons
ended their winning streak</i>

960
01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:49.004
<i>with a staggering loss to the Honda Goblins.</i>

961
01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.967
<i>Doggy Chop re-opened
all 11 of its domestic factories,</i>

962
01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:57.429
<i>and Puppy Snaps resumed production
with an improved product.</i>

963
01:32:02.142 --> 01:32:06.730
<i>Graft and political corruption were reduced
to sustainable, acceptable levels.</i>

964
01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:12.611
<i>The Dog-Flu serum cured every
breathing-animal in the region.</i>

965
01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:22.913
<i>Some say a few lost-dogs continue to
roam and scavenge on Trash Island.</i>

966
01:32:23.038 --> 01:32:26.958
<i>However, these rumors remain unconfirmed.</i>

967
01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:37.052
<i>Mayor Atari, we all agree
it should be a crime</i>

968
01:32:37.177 --> 01:32:40.806
<i>to abuse, beat, murder
or yell at any dog in Megasaki City.</i>

969
01:32:40.931 --> 01:32:42.474
<i>That is not the question.</i>

970
01:32:42.599 --> 01:32:45.685
<i>The question is:
what is the appropriate punishment?</i>

971
01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:50.440
<i>Exactly. And the answer is: Death Penalty.</i>

972
01:32:52.192 --> 01:32:53.735
<i>That seems excessive to us.</i>

973
01:32:54.986 --> 01:32:58.406
<i>Possibly. Anyway, we should make it
at least 30 days community-service</i>

974
01:32:58.532 --> 01:33:00.951
<i>and a fine of no less than 250,000 yen.</i>

975
01:33:01.076 --> 01:33:02.285
<i>Meeting adjourned.</i>

976
01:33:15.048 --> 01:33:17.509
I'm standing-by, Master Atari.

977
01:33:21.054 --> 01:33:23.181
So how does it feel to be a former stray?

978
01:33:23.515 --> 01:33:26.059
Hmm. I take it one day at a time.

979
01:33:26.184 --> 01:33:29.855
Last week, I nearly be-handed
an industrial lobbyist from West Suzuki.

980
01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:31.898
They had to give him a blood transfusion.

981
01:33:32.023 --> 01:33:34.484
He probably had it coming.

982
01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:37.445
Maybe. Learned any new tricks?

983
01:33:37.571 --> 01:33:39.614
Actually, yes. Just one.

984
01:33:39.739 --> 01:33:41.533
Can I see it?

985
01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:46.722
I'm supposed to be juggling ten
bowling-pins engulfed in flames

986
01:33:46.746 --> 01:33:50.292
over my tail at this point,
but you just have to imagine that part.

987
01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:53.962
I can picture it.

988
01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:58.174
You still against bringing
puppies into this world?

989
01:33:59.301 --> 01:34:01.469
I'll tell you when I get to know you better.

990
01:34:01.595 --> 01:34:03.138
Fair enough.

991
01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:06.391
My friends think I like to fight,

992
01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:08.310
but it's just not true.

993
01:34:08.435 --> 01:34:12.856
Sometimes I lose my temper and blow off
a little steam, but I've never enjoyed it.

994
01:34:13.523 --> 01:34:15.525
I'm not a violent dog.

995
01:34:17.027 --> 01:34:18.987
I don't know why I bite.

996
01:34:20.739 --> 01:34:22.907
I'm not attracted to tame animals.

997
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.038
Thank you.
