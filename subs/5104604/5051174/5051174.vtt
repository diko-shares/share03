<i>Mayor Atari,</i>

1394
01:32:34.671 --> 01:32:36.371
<i>we all agree
it should be a crime</i>

1395
01:32:36.373 --> 01:32:37.940
<i>to abuse, beat, murder</i>

1396
01:32:37.942 --> 01:32:40.174
<i>or yell at any dog
in Megasaki City.</i>

1397
01:32:40.176 --> 01:32:41.909
<i>That is not the question.</i>

1398
01:32:41.911 --> 01:32:43.312
<i>The question is:</i>

1399
01:32:43.314 --> 01:32:45.713
<i>what is the appropriate
punishment?</i>

1400
01:32:45.715 --> 01:32:49.786
<i>Exactly. And the answer is:
Death Penalty.</i>

1401
01:32:51.389 --> 01:32:54.021
<i>That seems excessive to us.</i>

1402
01:32:54.024 --> 01:32:55.824
<i>Possibly. Anyway,
we should make it</i>

1403
01:32:55.826 --> 01:32:57.660
<i>at least 30 days
community-service</i>

1404
01:32:57.662 --> 01:33:00.427
<i>and a fine
of no less than 250,000 yen.</i>

1405
01:33:00.429 --> 01:33:01.798
<i>Meeting adjourned.</i>

1406
01:33:12.008 --> 01:33:14.275
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

1407
01:33:14.277 --> 01:33:17.180
I'm standing-by, Master Atari.

1408
01:33:20.283 --> 01:33:22.650
NUTMEG: So how does it feel
to be a former stray?

1409
01:33:22.652 --> 01:33:25.387
Hmm. I take it
one day at a time.

1410
01:33:25.389 --> 01:33:26.920
Last week, I nearly be-handed

1411
01:33:26.922 --> 01:33:29.223
an industrial lobbyist
from West Suzuki.

1412
01:33:29.225 --> 01:33:31.259
They had to give him
a blood transfusion.

1413
01:33:31.261 --> 01:33:33.928
He probably had it coming.
(CHUCKLES)

1414
01:33:33.930 --> 01:33:36.898
Maybe. Learned any new tricks?

1415
01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:39.033
Actually, yes. Just one.

1416
01:33:39.035 --> 01:33:40.871
Can I see it?

1417
01:33:43.506 --> 01:33:44.771
I'm supposed to be juggling

1418
01:33:44.773 --> 01:33:46.040
ten bowling-pins
engulfed in flames

1419
01:33:46.042 --> 01:33:47.307
over my tail at this point,

1420
01:33:47.309 --> 01:33:49.744
but you just have to imagine
that part.

1421
01:33:49.746 --> 01:33:51.080
(CHUCKLES)

1422
01:33:51.082 --> 01:33:53.315
I can picture it.

1423
01:33:53.317 --> 01:33:58.486
You still against bringing
puppies into this world?

1424
01:33:58.488 --> 01:34:00.923
I'll tell you
when I get to know you better.

1425
01:34:00.925 --> 01:34:02.891
Fair enough.

1426
01:34:02.893 --> 01:34:05.627
My friends think
I like to fight,

1427
01:34:05.630 --> 01:34:07.594
but it's just not true.

1428
01:34:07.596 --> 01:34:10.199
Sometimes I lose my temper
and blow off a little steam,

1429
01:34:10.201 --> 01:34:12.866
but I've never enjoyed it.

1430
01:34:12.868 --> 01:34:14.871
I'm not a violent dog.

1431
01:34:16.274 --> 01:34:18.442
I don't know why I bite.

1432
01:34:19.844 --> 01:34:22.380
I'm not attracted
to tame animals.

1433
01:34:25.949 --> 01:34:27.484
Thank you.

1434
01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:35.792
(GONG RINGING)

1435
01:34:47.136 --> 01:34:48.535
(WIND CHIMES TINKLING)

1436
01:34:48.537 --> 01:34:50.273
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

1437
01:35:40.422 --> 01:35:42.492
(DRUMMING)

1438
01:36:09.786 --> 01:36:10.988
