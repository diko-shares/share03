"A great civilization is not conquered from without
until it has destroyed itself from within." W. Durant.

2
00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.119
The heart...

3
00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:32.504
for Smoke Frog.

4
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:33.838
Thank you.

5
00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.344
The liver for Curl Nose.

6
00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:42.696
Thank you.

7
00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.787
Cocoa Leaf, the ears.

8
00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.414
Thank you.

9
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.544
And for you, Blunted,

10
00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:00.939
the balls.

11
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.511
Not this again.

12
00:04:06.604 --> 00:04:09.164
- I'm helping you.
- Then you eat them!

13
00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.957
I don't need them.
Neither do the rest of the fellows.

14
00:04:10.957 --> 00:04:14.410
- Do you, fellows?
- No. Of course not!

15
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:15.880
Sometimes!

16
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.081
- What do you think?
- No!

17
00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.257
No, no!

18
00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.386
But how many times does it take?

19
00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:24.304
I have eight older sisters
and one brother.

20
00:04:24.304 --> 00:04:27.865
Father took tapir balls
all ten times.

21
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.934
Shall I tell him?

22
00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.620
I'm sorry. The balls are useless.

23
00:05:16.324 --> 00:05:17.857
You've never had them?

24
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:20.486
Couldn't tell you what they taste like.

25
00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.614
None of you?

26
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:27.285
No, but it's been fun watching you.

27
00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.198
This was your idea!

28
00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.586
Get him off me!

29
00:05:43.632 --> 00:05:44.842
Enough!

30
00:05:45.103 --> 00:05:46.802
Hey! Calm down!

31
00:05:50.022 --> 00:05:51.031
You!

32
00:05:58.472 --> 00:06:00.441
I wanna talk to you.

33
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.325
Why do you let them
treat you like this?

34
00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:09.199
Be strong.

35
00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:11.410
Where is your pride?

36
00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:21.812
It all works... yes?

37
00:06:22.807 --> 00:06:23.875
Yes...

38
00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.426
I just can't make children.

39
00:06:32.334 --> 00:06:35.367
There is something I will tell you...

40
00:06:35.987 --> 00:06:40.781
but I warn you, it's very powerful.

41
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:42.374
What do you speak of?

42
00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.320
The soanzo leaf.

43
00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.073
The soanzo leaf?

44
00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:49.834
From the great marshes in the south.

45
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.098
This is what gave me my ten children.

46
00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:06.226
No. No. Wait.

47
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.796
You have to rub them on... down there.

48
00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:15.073
Just before your next try.
Apply it generously.

49
00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:22.330
I don't know how to thank you.

50
00:07:23.768 --> 00:07:27.318
If this works,
maybe she'll stop bothering me.

51
00:07:27.455 --> 00:07:31.230
- Your wife?
- No, her mother.

52
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:34.400
The old hag wants grandchildren.

53
00:07:41.791 --> 00:07:44.602
Hey.
Give me some meat.

54
00:07:45.223 --> 00:07:47.225
Here, work on this...

55
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.435
pure meat...

56
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.639
Ball Breath.

57
00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:59.218
What do you want?

58
00:09:03.468 --> 00:09:04.761
What do you want?

59
00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:05.992
I am Flint Sky. I have hunted
this forest from the day I came of age.

60
00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:11.539
My father hunted this forest
with me and before me.

61
00:10:12.954 --> 00:10:17.937
Jaguar Paw, my son.
He hunts this forest with me.

62
00:10:18.313 --> 00:10:23.443
He will hunt it with his son
after I am gone.

63
00:10:42.734 --> 00:10:44.405
A good catch?

64
00:10:44.902 --> 00:10:47.141
Good waters here.

65
00:10:49.474 --> 00:10:51.329
The forest gives much here.

66
00:10:51.353 --> 00:10:52.279
Here.

67
00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.283
We ask only to pass through.

68
00:10:59.817 --> 00:11:01.088
Pass.

69
00:11:07.091 --> 00:11:09.080
Keep safe as you pass.

70
00:11:12.597 --> 00:11:14.669
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

71
00:11:50.868 --> 00:11:53.240
Our lands were ravaged.

72
00:11:53.971 --> 00:11:56.660
We seek a new beginning.

73
00:12:02.897 --> 00:12:04.835
Your lands were ravaged?

74
00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:09.590
Yes.

75
00:12:11.155 --> 00:12:13.785
We seek a new beginning.

76
00:12:14.309 --> 00:12:15.560
Be still.

77
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.164
MY Son!

78
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.123
Be still.

79
00:12:25.253 --> 00:12:26.940
Back to the village.

80
00:12:58.388 --> 00:13:05.812
Listen, I ask you not to speak
of what you saw in the forest today.

81
00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:11.242
You are troubled.

82
00:13:11.566 --> 00:13:13.317
Yes, I am.

83
00:13:29.534 --> 00:13:34.073
Those people in the forest,
what did you see on them?

84
00:13:34.305 --> 00:13:35.725
I do not understand.

85
00:13:36.857 --> 00:13:38.317
Fear.

86
00:13:41.412 --> 00:13:44.792
Deep rotting fear.

87
00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:47.743
They were infected by it.

88
00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:49.612
Did you see?

89
00:13:50.254 --> 00:13:53.901
Fear is a sickness.

90
00:13:57.678 --> 00:14:03.536
It will crawl into the soul
of anyone who engages it.

91
00:14:04.162 --> 00:14:08.774
It has tainted your peace already.

92
00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:14.422
I did not raise you
to see you live with fear.

93
00:14:16.514 --> 00:14:18.576
Strike it from your heart.

94
00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:21.444
Do not bring it into our village.

95
00:14:21.686 --> 00:14:26.125
At first light
we will gather with the elders...

96
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.460
at the sacred hill of our fathers.

97
00:14:29.604 --> 00:14:35.192
There we will call on
their spirits to guide us.

98
00:14:45.543 --> 00:14:47.730
Oh, here he is!

99
00:14:48.412 --> 00:14:50.316
The big lump!

100
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:54.586
He's useless.
He can't do it.

101
00:14:54.603 --> 00:14:56.947
You! Yes you!

102
00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:02.661
With your height and your girth.
You have deceived us.

103
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.153
Get inside!

104
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.504
Damn you! Get in there!

105
00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.037
Old woman, please!

106
00:15:13.254 --> 00:15:14.364
Move it!

107
00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:20.252
You don't work!

108
00:15:22.697 --> 00:15:24.741
What are you laughing about?

109
00:15:32.123 --> 00:15:37.554
Give me a grandchild
or I will have you replaced!

110
00:15:37.695 --> 00:15:39.823
Mother, that's enough.

111
00:15:40.573 --> 00:15:43.701
Do not come out
until you make a child.

112
00:15:45.369 --> 00:15:47.289
Two would be better!

113
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:48.321
What?

114
00:15:49.507 --> 00:15:52.210
Twins you owe.

115
00:16:00.468 --> 00:16:01.468
Mother.

116
00:16:02.219 --> 00:16:05.340
Can you go away?
He says he can't with you sitting there.

117
00:16:05.908 --> 00:16:08.518
- Mother.
- Let's get busy.

118
00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:10.895
Mom.

119
00:16:15.566 --> 00:16:17.026
She's gone.

120
00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:03.056
Mother, what do you say we should
have at the feast tonight?

121
00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:06.634
I have tapir,
but I also found this boy.

122
00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:09.312
I say boy roasted.

123
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.315
The tapir smells better.
I think it's more fresh.

124
00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.283
No Dad! No!
It's me! It's me!

125
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:17.186
I'll just hang the boy here
in case we change our minds.

126
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:21.616
Wait.

127
00:17:21.616 --> 00:17:24.785
That's our Turtles Run.
That's our eldest.

128
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:27.396
Yes, it's me.
It's your eldest.

129
00:17:27.972 --> 00:17:31.709
In that case,
a crush for my eldest...

130
00:17:34.895 --> 00:17:37.790
and a crush for my youngest.

131
00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:40.209
Tapir it is.

132
00:18:39.226 --> 00:18:41.712
I told you...
I told...

133
00:18:45.983 --> 00:18:48.718
One day, old man!

134
00:18:48.886 --> 00:18:51.455
One day you won't be able
to run anymore!

135
00:19:09.006 --> 00:19:12.367
And a man sat alone,

136
00:19:13.594 --> 00:19:16.138
drenched deep in sadness.

137
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:19.742
And all the animals
drew near to him and said:

138
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:25.104
"We do not like to see you so sad."

139
00:19:25.756 --> 00:19:29.218
"Ask us for whatever you wish
and you shall have it."

140
00:19:30.261 --> 00:19:34.598
The Man said:
"I want to have good sight."

141
00:19:36.216 --> 00:19:39.769
The vulture replied:
"You shall have mine."

142
00:19:42.038 --> 00:19:48.027
The Man said:
"I want to be strong, strong."

143
00:19:49.054 --> 00:19:53.049
The jaguar said:
"You shall be strong like me."

144
00:19:53.633 --> 00:19:57.203
Then the Man said:
"I have another wish.

145
00:19:58.371 --> 00:20:04.227
"I long to know
the secrets of the earth."

146
00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:11.192
The serpent replied:
"I will show them to you."

147
00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:15.004
And so it went
with all the animals.

148
00:20:16.824 --> 00:20:21.269
And when the Man had all the
gifts that they could give, he left.

149
00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:25.882
Then the owl said
to the other animals:

150
00:20:25.882 --> 00:20:30.553
"Now the Man knows much
and is able to do many things.

151
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:35.482
"Suddenly I am afraid."

152
00:20:37.478 --> 00:20:40.846
The deer said:
"The Man has all that he needs.

153
00:20:41.498 --> 00:20:43.916
"Now his sadness will stop."

154
00:20:44.168 --> 00:20:47.561
But the owl replied: "No.

155
00:20:48.839 --> 00:20:52.358
"I saw a hole in the Man...

156
00:20:52.776 --> 00:20:56.804
"deep like a hunger
he will never fill.

157
00:20:57.514 --> 00:21:02.634
"It is what makes him sad
and what makes him want.

158
00:21:05.172 --> 00:21:09.041
"He will go on taking and taking...

159
00:21:09.426 --> 00:21:12.638
"until one day the World will say:

160
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.924
"I am no more
and I have nothing left to give."

161
00:22:04.415 --> 00:22:06.250
Come back to me.

162
00:22:10.587 --> 00:22:12.423
Come back to me.

163
00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:44.427
My son is dancing.

164
00:22:44.939 --> 00:22:47.096
Your son is happy.

165
00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:41.120
What do you want?

166
00:23:57.136 --> 00:23:59.410
Run!

167
00:24:14.445 --> 00:24:18.612
Now that you're up,
can you please kill that dog?

168
00:24:31.628 --> 00:24:33.672
The dog.

169
00:26:01.301 --> 00:26:04.175
Get up! Get up!
Now!

170
00:26:10.757 --> 00:26:11.757
Run!

171
00:26:43.206 --> 00:26:44.331
Tie him up!

172
00:27:18.629 --> 00:27:20.668
Go to the forest.

173
00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:22.853
Run. Do not look back.

174
00:27:48.525 --> 00:27:50.360
No, No.
I am afraid.

175
00:27:50.494 --> 00:27:52.616
Look into my eyes.
Look into my eyes.

176
00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:55.302
- Be strong.
- I am afraid.

177
00:27:56.083 --> 00:27:57.929
Be strong.

178
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:48.146
Let him go!
Let go!

179
00:28:56.059 --> 00:28:57.296
Tie him up!

180
00:30:14.755 --> 00:30:16.175
Father!

181
00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:19.729
- Father!
- The others. I have to help.

182
00:30:19.753 --> 00:30:22.848
- Father!
- No, no, don't leave us!

183
00:30:22.848 --> 00:30:25.793
I will come back, I promise.

184
00:30:25.893 --> 00:30:28.320
- Don't you leave!
- I promise.

185
00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.148
- Stay.
- Father, don't go!

186
00:30:31.849 --> 00:30:33.542
No, don't leave!

187
00:30:34.677 --> 00:30:36.211
Please stay!

188
00:30:40.516 --> 00:30:43.202
Help me!

189
00:31:19.772 --> 00:31:22.232
No, let me go!

190
00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:29.114
Very nice.

191
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:17.103
Stop!

192
00:32:25.352 --> 00:32:26.645
Tie him up!

193
00:32:31.124 --> 00:32:33.010
I want him alive!

194
00:32:52.963 --> 00:32:54.824
Sorry, Father.

195
00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:15.277
That's enough!

196
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.664
Stand him up.

197
00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.907
Move away.

198
00:33:50.854 --> 00:33:52.647
My son.

199
00:34:03.533 --> 00:34:05.852
Don't be afraid.

200
00:35:03.635 --> 00:35:05.328
Almost...

201
00:35:21.027 --> 00:35:23.721
that's your name.

202
00:35:24.614 --> 00:35:27.183
"Almost."

203
00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:38.819
Our life is over.

204
00:35:39.779 --> 00:35:42.198
Our life is over.

205
00:35:43.675 --> 00:35:46.136
Our life is over.

206
00:35:47.854 --> 00:35:49.914
Our life is over.

207
00:35:50.958 --> 00:35:52.750
Shame!

208
00:35:53.393 --> 00:35:55.127
Shame!

209
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.451
Shame!

210
00:36:06.122 --> 00:36:08.290
Cowards!

211
00:36:10.184 --> 00:36:12.269
Cowards!

212
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.155
Cowards!

213
00:36:26.993 --> 00:36:28.310
Come here!

214
00:36:29.453 --> 00:36:31.730
Cowards!

215
00:36:48.055 --> 00:36:49.081
Harder.

216
00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:13.605
Mom!

217
00:37:13.729 --> 00:37:17.083
No! My child!

218
00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:52.544


219
00:38:01.253 --> 00:38:05.390


220
00:38:23.358 --> 00:38:27.996


221
00:39:42.038 --> 00:39:43.831
Let's move!

222
00:39:45.272 --> 00:39:46.949
All move!

223
00:41:57.454 --> 00:41:58.663
Mom.

224
00:42:01.082 --> 00:42:02.516
Uyed!

225
00:42:03.513 --> 00:42:05.253
We move out now.

226
00:42:05.264 --> 00:42:06.682
They are back.

227
00:42:07.155 --> 00:42:08.422
Get around!

228
00:42:08.806 --> 00:42:10.983
- Stand up, stand up!
- Get up!

229
00:42:11.834 --> 00:42:12.877
Get up!

230
00:42:12.901 --> 00:42:14.920
- Together.
- Heave!

231
00:42:15.363 --> 00:42:16.655
One file.

232
00:42:16.921 --> 00:42:18.007
Move!

233
00:42:18.131 --> 00:42:19.341
Move it!

234
00:42:20.201 --> 00:42:21.510
All together!

235
00:42:22.532 --> 00:42:25.681
Cut Rock, you forgot to duck.

236
00:42:28.246 --> 00:42:29.539
Hold still.

237
00:42:30.853 --> 00:42:32.604
I said hold still.

238
00:42:39.257 --> 00:42:40.721
Can you see?

239
00:42:42.802 --> 00:42:43.932
Yes.

240
00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.013
Get back to your line.

241
00:43:11.268 --> 00:43:12.310
Move!

242
00:43:15.281 --> 00:43:18.024
Faster! Faster!

243
00:43:24.823 --> 00:43:27.017
Mom! Mom!

244
00:43:28.035 --> 00:43:28.994
Mom!

245
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:48.847
Come with us.

246
00:44:00.901 --> 00:44:02.360
Here she is.

247
00:44:05.697 --> 00:44:06.698
Mom!

248
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.540
Come.
Mother, come.

249
00:44:41.003 --> 00:44:42.171
Get up.

250
00:44:54.767 --> 00:44:56.956
Leave him alone, "Almost."

251
00:44:59.188 --> 00:45:01.065
I said get up.

252
00:45:29.635 --> 00:45:31.499
Up.

253
00:45:31.887 --> 00:45:33.893
That's it.

254
00:45:35.558 --> 00:45:36.892
Let's go!

255
00:45:38.573 --> 00:45:39.748
Move.

256
00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:44.712
This man is a good friend of yours.

257
00:46:11.572 --> 00:46:13.323
Mom!

258
00:46:14.241 --> 00:46:15.617
Mom!

259
00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:20.606
Don't worry...

260
00:46:24.106 --> 00:46:26.628
I'll take care of them!

261
00:46:29.028 --> 00:46:31.322
They are mine now!

262
00:46:38.621 --> 00:46:43.753
Gentle Lord,
tender mother of mercy,

263
00:46:44.502 --> 00:46:47.090
keep them from harm.

264
00:46:48.025 --> 00:46:51.236
Please keep them in their ways.

265
00:47:25.543 --> 00:47:27.169
One more.

266
00:47:50.776 --> 00:47:52.155
Ready?

267
00:48:23.703 --> 00:48:24.879
Water.

268
00:48:52.922 --> 00:48:54.642
Hold on! Hold on!

269
00:48:58.928 --> 00:49:00.931
Wait. Wait.

270
00:49:02.014 --> 00:49:04.326
Let's see what happens.

271
00:49:11.915 --> 00:49:13.193
That's it.

272
00:49:19.949 --> 00:49:21.158
Hurry!

273
00:49:22.117 --> 00:49:24.078
Pull! Pull!

274
00:49:43.538 --> 00:49:45.242
Yes!

275
00:49:46.201 --> 00:49:47.911
You did it!

276
00:49:48.411 --> 00:49:50.814
You did good work!

277
00:49:51.315 --> 00:49:54.584
You're not totally useless!

278
00:49:54.608 --> 00:49:56.503
Way to go.

279
00:50:03.325 --> 00:50:06.513
How are you? Can you breathe?
Good.

280
00:50:35.858 --> 00:50:36.858
Wait here.

281
00:50:41.923 --> 00:50:43.516
What's now?

282
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.370
What's become of my capture?

283
00:51:15.564 --> 00:51:17.024
Dead weight.

284
00:51:18.734 --> 00:51:21.295
He nearly took the rest with him.

285
00:51:23.238 --> 00:51:24.907
I let him go.

286
00:51:29.161 --> 00:51:30.913
You let him go?

287
00:51:37.961 --> 00:51:41.732
Shall we now do what you want?

288
00:51:45.803 --> 00:51:47.905
Let us try that.

289
00:52:07.975 --> 00:52:08.900
Well?

290
00:52:12.037 --> 00:52:15.599
Don't let any others go.

291
00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:23.065
Let's move.

292
00:52:23.416 --> 00:52:24.591
Move!

293
00:52:26.235 --> 00:52:27.344
Get up.

294
00:52:31.156 --> 00:52:32.240
Do it!

295
00:52:38.063 --> 00:52:40.549
Get up, "Almost."

296
00:52:41.316 --> 00:52:45.462
We don't want to lose you just yet.

297
00:52:47.214 --> 00:52:48.214
♪

298
00:53:25.227 --> 00:53:29.005
And at the end
he got hit in his head.

299
00:53:29.381 --> 00:53:31.591
Since then he is...

300
00:53:35.037 --> 00:53:37.039
Stand up, boy.

301
00:53:41.434 --> 00:53:42.477
OK.

302
00:53:45.798 --> 00:53:48.983
You proved yourself today, my son.

303
00:53:49.051 --> 00:53:53.362
You're now worthy to stand
with the rest of us.

304
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:59.118
Thank you, Father.

305
00:54:05.417 --> 00:54:06.417
Take it.

306
00:54:07.986 --> 00:54:09.587
Take it.

307
00:54:10.113 --> 00:54:11.365
Yours.

308
00:54:12.382 --> 00:54:13.841
It's yours.

309
00:54:15.452 --> 00:54:18.721
It has taken many lives.

310
00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:32.176
Get some rest.

311
00:54:46.441 --> 00:54:51.003
Resting brothers, fathers,
mothers, wives,

312
00:54:52.281 --> 00:54:57.217
you felt the cold
of this day's early morning.

313
00:54:57.369 --> 00:55:02.264
Now you cannot feel
the coldness of its night.

314
00:55:04.293 --> 00:55:06.769
She stopped screaming.

315
00:55:08.463 --> 00:55:11.940
Too long before they returned,
she had stopped screaming.

316
00:55:12.301 --> 00:55:15.761
We saw how she fought them.

317
00:55:16.013 --> 00:55:18.706
But in the final moment?

318
00:55:19.474 --> 00:55:22.017
If she let them,

319
00:55:24.021 --> 00:55:29.733
the Goddess of the Scaffold
shows no mercy for the weakness.

320
00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:36.406
Her soul waits for yours
in the shade of the Ceiba Tree.

321
00:55:46.335 --> 00:55:48.477
I need to know.

322
00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:55.509
Before this day's end,
I will leave this world.

323
00:55:56.261 --> 00:56:02.516
I will take as many
of these bastard dogs with me as I can.

324
00:56:04.061 --> 00:56:11.074
And I will gladly embrace
the torments of hell,

325
00:56:11.174 --> 00:56:14.127
if I do not find
my Sky Flower there.

326
00:56:21.453 --> 00:56:23.219
Don't rain.

327
00:56:53.759 --> 00:56:56.144
- Watch out!
- Move!

328
00:57:06.248 --> 00:57:08.083
I am walking here!

329
00:57:40.866 --> 00:57:43.182
Keep away, she has the sickness.

330
00:58:08.477 --> 00:58:10.145
Get back!

331
00:59:03.031 --> 00:59:05.964
You fear me?

332
00:59:06.576 --> 00:59:09.204
So you should...

333
00:59:09.871 --> 00:59:14.889
all you who are vile.

334
00:59:15.599 --> 00:59:20.562
Would you like to know
how you will die?

335
00:59:26.888 --> 00:59:31.556
The sacred time is near.

336
00:59:32.894 --> 00:59:37.996
Beware the blackness of day.

337
00:59:40.235 --> 00:59:47.088
Beware the man
who brings the jaguar.

338
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:53.578
Behold him reborn
from mud and earth,

339
00:59:53.665 --> 01:00:00.618
for the one he takes you to
will cancel the sky

340
01:00:00.672 --> 01:00:03.550
and scratch out the earth.

341
01:00:04.676 --> 01:00:07.650
Scratch you out...

342
01:00:08.263 --> 01:00:11.445
and end your world.

343
01:00:17.622 --> 01:00:22.623
He's with us now.

344
01:00:27.616 --> 01:00:31.082
Day will be like night,

345
01:00:31.182 --> 01:00:36.387
and the man jaguar
will lead you to your end!

346
01:00:41.334 --> 01:00:42.560
Come on!

347
01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.813
Hurry!

348
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:49.775
Move!

349
01:01:15.918 --> 01:01:18.037
Move! Hurry!

350
01:01:19.313 --> 01:01:20.472
Lift!

351
01:01:33.761 --> 01:01:36.071
Lift! Bring it here!

352
01:01:46.528 --> 01:01:48.333
Where are they taking us?

353
01:01:53.118 --> 01:01:58.218
We tell stories
of a place stone-built.

354
01:01:59.428 --> 01:02:01.054
What happens there?

355
01:02:01.764 --> 01:02:03.557
I do not know,

356
01:02:04.462 --> 01:02:10.772
but the earth bleeds non stop.

357
01:02:11.052 --> 01:02:12.929
We are near.

358
01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:30.583
It's here.
It's somewhere here.

359
01:02:45.607 --> 01:02:48.985


360
01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.634
Help me! Help me!

361
01:02:56.848 --> 01:03:00.530
He has the laughing sickness.

362
01:03:00.935 --> 01:03:03.166
- He likes you.
- Help me! Help me!

363
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:05.601
Save me! Save me!

364
01:03:05.727 --> 01:03:06.820
Help me.

365
01:03:09.956 --> 01:03:12.375
Help me! Help me!

366
01:03:13.652 --> 01:03:15.053
Help me! Help me!

367
01:03:15.253 --> 01:03:17.755
Save me! Save me!

368
01:03:17.879 --> 01:03:19.741
Save me!

369
01:03:21.268 --> 01:03:24.078
Save me! Save me!

370
01:03:24.876 --> 01:03:26.461
Die like a man.

371
01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:37.825


372
01:03:49.203 --> 01:03:50.579
Go there!

373
01:04:01.924 --> 01:04:05.561


374
01:04:14.145 --> 01:04:16.238
Take these overe there!

375
01:04:46.077 --> 01:04:49.329
Stop!
Where are you going?

376
01:04:53.259 --> 01:04:55.210
It's mine. It's mine.

377
01:04:57.538 --> 01:04:59.606
It's mine. It's mine.

378
01:05:35.058 --> 01:05:38.820


379
01:05:43.066 --> 01:05:44.901
Look at them.

380
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:55.003
Go somewere else.

381
01:05:57.698 --> 01:06:00.175
Here... find the answer.

382
01:06:03.412 --> 01:06:04.504
Here.

383
01:06:07.038 --> 01:06:08.424
Welcome back.

384
01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:12.637
- Have you been successful?
- Ask my son.

385
01:06:14.379 --> 01:06:17.208
- How many captives?
- Deal with my son.

386
01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:21.521
A fair price, yes?

387
01:06:21.553 --> 01:06:23.673
As always, trust me.

388
01:06:24.138 --> 01:06:25.341
Good, good.

389
01:06:25.365 --> 01:06:27.365
- Be blessed.
- You too.

390
01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:31.497


391
01:06:31.501 --> 01:06:34.292


392
01:06:41.867 --> 01:06:44.668
How much will you give me?
How much?

393
01:06:44.692 --> 01:06:47.872
Look how pretty she is.
How much? How much?

394
01:06:47.972 --> 01:06:50.266
- 100!
- Two sheeps!

395
01:07:11.237 --> 01:07:13.197
Who would buy her?

396
01:07:17.618 --> 01:07:21.914
- How much for this one?
- I want her!

397
01:07:23.457 --> 01:07:25.250
Give her to my friend there.

398
01:07:33.693 --> 01:07:35.060
Give me a bite.

399
01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:43.168
Come on, come on.

400
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:47.156
Now a real hottie.

401
01:07:47.156 --> 01:07:50.133
Who will buy this woman, ah?
Who?

402
01:07:50.409 --> 01:07:51.927
She's too old!

403
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:56.999
She's still can be useful.
She can cook, clean.

404
01:07:57.074 --> 01:07:59.326
- Useless old woman.
- No.

405
01:08:00.035 --> 01:08:01.370
Worthless.

406
01:08:01.545 --> 01:08:03.580
Who?
Who want her?

407
01:08:03.581 --> 01:08:05.573
There's no sale here.

408
01:08:07.376 --> 01:08:08.927
Useless.

409
01:08:11.129 --> 01:08:15.675
Go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

410
01:09:06.151 --> 01:09:08.862


411
01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:26.170


412
01:09:29.491 --> 01:09:32.301


413
01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.718
The end, the end.

414
01:12:49.781 --> 01:12:51.541


415
01:13:15.883 --> 01:13:19.210
These are the days
of our great lament.

416
01:13:24.842 --> 01:13:27.067
The land thirsts.

417
01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:33.507
A great plague infests our crops.

418
01:13:35.937 --> 01:13:42.708
The scourge of sickness
afflicts us at whim!

419
01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:51.383
They say this strife
has made us weak!

420
01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:54.636
That we have become empty!

421
01:13:56.757 --> 01:14:00.801
They say that we rot!

422
01:14:10.771 --> 01:14:14.239
Great people
of the banner of the sun,

423
01:14:14.442 --> 01:14:19.453
I say we are strong!

424
01:14:23.151 --> 01:14:25.750
We are a people of destiny.

425
01:14:30.291 --> 01:14:34.134
Destined to be the masters of time!

426
01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:43.518
Destined to be nearest to the gods!

427
01:14:56.859 --> 01:15:01.920
Mighty Kukulkan,
Blessed Kukulkan,

428
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:06.624
whose fury could scorch
this earth to oblivion,

429
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.837
let us appease you
with this sacrifice.

430
01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:13.673
To exalt you in your glory.

431
01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:17.468
To make our people prosper.

432
01:15:18.289 --> 01:15:23.291
To prepare for your return!

433
01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:27.478
Warrior, unafraid and willing,

434
01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:32.442
with your blood
you renew the world from age to age.

435
01:15:33.354 --> 01:15:35.036
Thank you!

436
01:15:49.703 --> 01:15:54.255
The heart of the world!

437
01:16:07.977 --> 01:16:10.696


438
01:16:41.052 --> 01:16:42.870
A gift for the gods!

439
01:17:07.645 --> 01:17:11.440
Dear soul, your journey begins now.

440
01:17:12.041 --> 01:17:14.009
Take our spirits with you.

441
01:17:15.886 --> 01:17:18.305
We will see you on the other side.

442
01:17:40.819 --> 01:17:44.447
The heart of the world!

443
01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:37.871
Come back to me.

444
01:18:46.897 --> 01:18:48.774
Brother...

445
01:18:50.551 --> 01:18:52.765
journey well.

446
01:18:54.555 --> 01:18:55.768
No.

447
01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:58.262
I can't go.

448
01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:01.232
Not now.

449
01:19:29.677 --> 01:19:32.680
Renew the world!

450
01:19:45.935 --> 01:19:53.083


451
01:19:53.985 --> 01:19:57.120
A new gift for the spirits.

452
01:19:57.164 --> 01:19:58.747
A new heart...

453
01:20:01.384 --> 01:20:05.554
for the lords
of the Earth, air, and ocean.

454
01:20:05.554 --> 01:20:10.392


455
01:20:26.275 --> 01:20:28.869


456
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:46.294
The sky...

457
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.723
The sky...

458
01:20:50.632 --> 01:20:55.562
are talking to their children.

459
01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:26.417
People of the banner of the sun,
do not fear!

460
01:21:26.707 --> 01:21:29.779
Rejoice!

461
01:21:29.793 --> 01:21:33.116
Kukulkan has drunk
his fill of blood.

462
01:21:33.213 --> 01:21:37.011
We have sated his thirst.

463
01:21:37.334 --> 01:21:39.472
Great God...

464
01:21:39.803 --> 01:21:42.055
show us that you are pleased.

465
01:21:42.306 --> 01:21:48.731
Let your light return upon us!

466
01:22:51.291 --> 01:22:53.335
What of these captives?

467
01:22:58.048 --> 01:22:59.967
Dispose of them.

468
01:23:02.388 --> 01:23:04.898
Move now!
Go!

469
01:23:05.725 --> 01:23:06.959
You useless dirt!

470
01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:09.102
Lousy Animals!

471
01:23:13.382 --> 01:23:14.441
Move!

472
01:23:21.457 --> 01:23:23.850
Line up!
Thats it.

473
01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:36.545
I need a finisher.

474
01:23:41.592 --> 01:23:42.884
You.

475
01:23:49.016 --> 01:23:50.559
Release them.

476
01:23:58.859 --> 01:24:00.485
You watch.

477
01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:23.468
I'm ready!

478
01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:32.060
There's your jungle,
beyond the corn.

479
01:24:33.393 --> 01:24:35.463
Go to it.

480
01:24:35.604 --> 01:24:37.523
You're free.

481
01:24:38.899 --> 01:24:41.235
Now run.

482
01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:45.239
I said...

483
01:24:46.683 --> 01:24:48.267
run.

484
01:24:49.326 --> 01:24:50.995
Run!

485
01:25:03.683 --> 01:25:04.934
Rabbit goes!

486
01:25:26.881 --> 01:25:28.583
Did you see that?

487
01:25:36.207 --> 01:25:38.484
The rabbit escapes.

488
01:25:48.344 --> 01:25:49.603
I got him.

489
01:25:51.806 --> 01:25:53.274
In the center.

490
01:26:04.234 --> 01:26:05.661
Not bad.

491
01:26:23.503 --> 01:26:25.297
Your turn.

492
01:26:32.679 --> 01:26:34.748
Now run.

493
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.183
Run away!

494
01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:56.596
Kill him!

495
01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:37.119
Get him!

496
01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:07.626
Sleep.

497
01:29:08.585 --> 01:29:10.335
Sleep, my son.

498
01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:14.115
The pain will be no more.

499
01:29:16.176 --> 01:29:17.618
Sleep.

500
01:29:54.171 --> 01:29:56.890
- Go there!
- He's dead!

501
01:35:07.527 --> 01:35:09.696
He didn't come this way.

502
01:35:22.959 --> 01:35:24.919
He's in the trees.

503
01:35:26.713 --> 01:35:27.922
Spread out.

504
01:35:28.798 --> 01:35:30.471
Keep your eyes up.

505
01:35:52.739 --> 01:35:53.885
Quiet.

506
01:36:05.418 --> 01:36:07.049
He's coming right at us.

507
01:36:23.311 --> 01:36:24.311
There!

508
01:38:22.221 --> 01:38:24.932
He would have wanted me to have it.

509
01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:30.357
The omen is bad.

510
01:38:31.981 --> 01:38:35.896
Mighty Ek Chuah, we beg you,

511
01:38:36.319 --> 01:38:41.443
forgive us for this trespass
against your son the jaguar.

512
01:38:42.575 --> 01:38:45.447
The omen is bad.

513
01:38:47.087 --> 01:38:52.996
Lift yourself up Drunkards Four
the omen was foretold.

514
01:38:55.004 --> 01:38:58.216
And now we have a fear more grave -

515
01:38:59.175 --> 01:39:03.048
today I saw the day
become like night.

516
01:39:09.101 --> 01:39:14.543
I saw a man run with the jaguar.

517
01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:21.107
We must not let this man
make feet from us.

518
01:39:21.489 --> 01:39:22.801
Enough!

519
01:39:26.452 --> 01:39:28.740
Your words mean nothing.

520
01:39:29.764 --> 01:39:32.577
He runs because he is afraid.

521
01:39:33.392 --> 01:39:39.542
When I catch him,
I will peel his skin,

522
01:39:39.966 --> 01:39:42.904
and have him watch me wear it.

523
01:39:50.393 --> 01:39:51.871
We go now!

524
01:40:53.032 --> 01:40:54.032


525
01:41:59.271 --> 01:42:01.516
Stay back. Stay back.

526
01:43:11.385 --> 01:43:12.511
Here.

527
01:43:37.077 --> 01:43:40.640
The omen was bad.
Bad luck.

528
01:43:42.917 --> 01:43:44.493
He's fucked.

529
01:43:47.379 --> 01:43:49.582
Help... please.

530
01:43:49.690 --> 01:43:51.250
Hanging Moss,

531
01:43:52.551 --> 01:43:54.086
take him...

532
01:43:55.296 --> 01:43:56.739
out.

533
01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:18.944
Open your veins. It's quicker.

534
01:44:19.737 --> 01:44:21.305
Make it easy on yourself.

535
01:44:31.006 --> 01:44:32.666
Travel well.

536
01:47:38.944 --> 01:47:41.655
So much for your prophecies.

537
01:47:47.536 --> 01:47:48.927
It's not over!

538
01:48:14.813 --> 01:48:16.440
I am jaguar Paw!

539
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:19.349
Son of Flint Sky!

540
01:48:20.152 --> 01:48:24.020
My father hunted
this forest before me!

541
01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.440
My name is jaguar Paw!

542
01:48:28.035 --> 01:48:29.661
I am a hunter!

543
01:48:31.246 --> 01:48:33.499
This is my forest!

544
01:48:34.366 --> 01:48:37.475
And my sons will hunt it
with their sons,

545
01:48:38.076 --> 01:48:40.870
after I am gone!

546
01:48:42.091 --> 01:48:43.665
Come on!

547
01:48:44.425 --> 01:48:45.984
Come on!

548
01:48:46.011 --> 01:48:48.069
We are going over.

549
01:48:48.263 --> 01:48:52.132
We climb down from around.

550
01:48:52.367 --> 01:48:55.268
We cannot let him get away.

551
01:48:55.368 --> 01:48:56.353
We cannot afford...

552
01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:19.659
We all jump.

553
01:52:15.554 --> 01:52:17.710
I am jaguar Paw.

554
01:52:19.157 --> 01:52:21.589
This is my forest.

555
01:52:22.978 --> 01:52:26.010
And I am not afraid.

556
01:54:03.190 --> 01:54:04.591
Here.

557
01:54:33.108 --> 01:54:35.694
You go. I'll wait here.

558
01:57:13.963 --> 01:57:15.047
Mom!

559
02:00:05.190 --> 02:00:07.342
"Almost."

560
02:00:33.885 --> 02:00:37.622
Resting fathers,
fly me your strength.

561
02:01:03.681 --> 02:01:06.359
Get up here. Get up here.

562
02:01:11.782 --> 02:01:13.783
Mom!
Mommy!

563
02:01:20.065 --> 02:01:22.917
No, go back, go back.
Go Back.

564
02:01:49.703 --> 02:01:51.538
- Get us out!
- Hurry up!

565
02:01:51.538 --> 02:01:54.490
- Quick! Come on!
