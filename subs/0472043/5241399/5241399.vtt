"A great civilization is not conquered from without
until it has destroyed itself from within." W. Durant.

2
00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.119
The heart...

3
00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:32.504
<i>for Smoke Frog.</i>

4
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:33.838
Thank you.

5
00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:42.055
This liver for Curl Nose.

6
00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.140
Thank you.

7
00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.188
<i>Cocoa Leaf...</i>

8
00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:51.523
the ears.

9
00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.982
Thank you.

10
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.403
And for you Blunted...

11
00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.825
<i>the balls.</i>

12
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.246
Not this again.

13
00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:07.705
I'm helping you.

14
00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.040
Then you eat them!

15
00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.543
I don't need them.
Neither do the rest of the fellows.

16
00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.669
Do you fellows?

17
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.503
No.

18
00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.546
Of course not!

19
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:15.880
Sometimes!

20
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.089
What do you think?

21
00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.049
No!

22
00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.133
No, no!

23
00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.386
But how many times does it take?

24
00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:24.264
I have eight older sisters
and one brother.

25
00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:28.017
Father took tapir balls all ten times.

26
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.934
Shall I tell him?

27
00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.272
I'm sorry. The balls are useless.

28
00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:17.734
You've never had them?

29
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:20.486
Couldn't tell you what they taste like.

30
00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.614
None of you?

31
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:27.285
No, but it's been fun watching you...

32
00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.125
This was your idea!

33
00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.421
Get him off me!

34
00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:46.930
Calm down!

35
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.325
Why do you let them treat you like this?

36
00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.369
Be strong.

37
00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.454
Where is your pride?

38
00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.545
It all works... Yes?

39
00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:24.175
<i>Yes...</i>

40
00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:27.512
<i>I</i> just can't make children.

41
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:35.520
There is something I will tell you...

42
00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:39.482
but I warn you, it's very powerful.

43
00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.109
What do you speak of?

44
00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.320
The soanzo leaf.

45
00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.073
The soanzo leaf?

46
00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:50.034
From the great marshes in the south...

47
00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:57.875
This is what gave me my ten children.

48
00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.426
<i>No'. No'. Wait...</i>

49
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.096
You have to rub them on... down there.

50
00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.057
Just before you next try.

51
00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.393
Apply it generously...

52
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.066
I don't know how to thank you.

53
00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:27.238
If this works...
maybe she'll stop bothering me.

54
00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:28.740
Your wife?

55
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.075
No, her mother.

56
00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.786
The old hag wants grandchildren.

57
00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:44.922
Give me some meat.

58
00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.425
<i>Here, work</i> on <i>this...</i>

59
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.635
<i>pure meat...</i>

60
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.639
<i>ball breath.</i>

61
00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.205
What do you want?

62
00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:04.961
What do you want?

63
00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:05.605
I am Flint Sky. I have hunted
this forest from the day I came of age.

64
00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:11.527
My father hunted this forest
with me and before me.

65
00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:15.072
Jaguar Paw, my son.

66
00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:17.742
He hunts this forest with me.

67
00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:22.747
He will hunt it with his son
after I am gone.

68
00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.268
A good catch?

69
00:10:45.102 --> 00:10:47.104
Good waters here.

70
00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.234
The forest gives much here.

71
00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.283
We ask only to pass through.

72
00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:01.452
Pass.

73
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:09.126
Keep safe as you pass.

74
00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.340
Let's go.

75
00:11:51.168 --> 00:11:53.337
Our lands were ravaged.

76
00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:56.132
We seek a new beginning.

77
00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.682
Your lands were ravaged?

78
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.021
<i>Yes...</i>

79
00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:14.025
We seek a new beginning...

80
00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:15.860
Be still.

81
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.110
MY Son!

82
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.323
Be still.

83
00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.746
Back to the village.

84
00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:05.409
I ask you not to speak
of what you saw in the forest today.

85
00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:11.415
You are troubled.

86
00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.417
Yes, I am.

87
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:34.063
Those people in the forest,
what did you see on them?

88
00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:35.773
I do not understand.

89
00:13:36.857 --> 00:13:38.317
Fean.

90
00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:44.615
Deep rotting fear.

91
00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:47.743
They were infected by it.

92
00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:49.912
Did you see?

93
00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:52.623
Fear is a sickness.

94
00:13:57.878 --> 00:14:02.007
It will crawl into the soul
of anyone who engages it.

95
00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:07.972
It has tainted your peace already.

96
00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:14.311
I did not raise you
to see you live with fear.

97
00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:18.524
Strike it from your heart.

98
00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:21.444
Do not bring it into our village.

99
00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:25.614
At first light
we will gather with the elders...

100
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.660
<i>at</i> the sacred hill of our fathers.

101
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:34.665
There we will call on
their spirits to guide us.

102
00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:47.553
Oh, here he is!

103
00:14:48.512 --> 00:14:49.847
The big lump!

104
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.183
He's useless.

105
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.351
He can't do it.

106
00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.688
You! Yes you!

107
00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:01.817
With your height and your girth.
You have deceived us.

108
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.153
Get inside!

109
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.202
Damn you! Get in there!

110
00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.037
Old woman, please.

111
00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:14.454
Move it!

112
00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:20.252
You don't work!

113
00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.256
What are you laughing about?

114
00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:36.727
Give me a grandchild
or I will have you replaced.

115
00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:39.772
Mother, that's enough.

116
00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:43.901
Do not come out until you make a child.

117
00:15:45.569 --> 00:15:47.071
Two would be better!

118
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:48.321
What?

119
00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:51.909
Twins you oaf.

120
00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:01.668
Mother.

121
00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:06.757
Can you go away?
He says he can't with you sitting there.

122
00:16:07.174 --> 00:16:08.551
Lust get busy.

123
00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.095
<i>Mom...</i>

124
00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:17.226
She's gone.

125
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:03.522
Mother, what do you say we should
have at the feast tonight?

126
00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:06.483
I have tapir...
but I also found this boy.

127
00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:07.943
I say bOY-

128
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:09.152
Roasted!

129
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.947
The tapir smells better.
I think it's more fresh.

130
00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.283
No Dad! No! It's me! It's me!

131
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:17.286
I'll just hang the boy here
in case we change our minds.

132
00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:21.540
<i>Wait...</i>

133
00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:24.627
That's our Turtles Run.
That's our eldest.

134
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:27.296
Yes it's me. It's your eldest!

135
00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:31.508
In that case, a crush for my eldest...

136
00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:37.389
and a crush for my youngest.

137
00:17:38.682 --> 00:17:41.018
Tapir it is.

138
00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:48.544
One day, old man!

139
00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:51.422
One day you won't be able
to run anymore!

140
00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:12.276
And a Man sat alone.

141
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:16.238
Drenched deep in sadness.

142
00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:19.742
And all the animals
drew near to him and said:

143
00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:24.163
"We do not like to see you so sad..."

144
00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:29.418
"Ask us for whatever you wish
and you shall have it."

145
00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:34.798
The Man said:
"I want to have good sight."

146
00:19:36.216 --> 00:19:39.428
The vulture replied:
"You shall have mine."

147
00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:45.642
The Man said: "I want to be strong."

148
00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:51.148
The jaguar said:

149
00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:56.445
"You shall be strong like me."

150
00:19:58.405 --> 00:20:04.286
Then the Man said: "I long
to know the secrets of the earth."

151
00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:10.834
The serpent replied:
"I will show them to you."

152
00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:15.214
And so it went with all the animals.

153
00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.676
And when the Man had
all the gifts that they could give...

154
00:20:19.843 --> 00:20:21.512
<i>he left.</i>

155
00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.349
Then the owl said to the other animals:

156
00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:30.145
"Now the Man knows much
and is able to do many things..."

157
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.566
"Suddenly I am afraid."

158
00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:40.572
The deer said:
"The Man has all that he needs."

159
00:20:41.698 --> 00:20:43.700
"Now his sadness will stop."

160
00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:46.370
But the owl replied: "No."

161
00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:51.875
"I saw a hole in the Man...

162
00:20:52.876 --> 00:20:56.672
"Deep like a hunger
he will never fill..."

163
00:20:57.714 --> 00:21:02.219
"It is what makes him sad
and what makes him want."

164
00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:08.559
"He will go on taking and taking...

165
00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:12.938
"Until one day the World will say:"

166
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.860
"I am no more
and I have nothing left to give."

167
00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:06.450
Come back to <i>me...</i>

168
00:22:10.787 --> 00:22:12.623
Come back to me.

169
00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:43.528
My son is dancing.

170
00:22:45.239 --> 00:22:47.366
Your son is happy-

171
00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:41.420
What do you want?

172
00:23:57.436 --> 00:23:59.187
Run!

173
00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:18.749
Now that you're up,
can you please kill that dog?

174
00:24:31.928 --> 00:24:33.972
The dog.

175
00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:03.186
Get up! Get up! Now!

176
00:27:18.929 --> 00:27:20.555
Go to the forest.

177
00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:22.807
Run! Do not look back.

178
00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:50.460
No! No! I am afraid!

179
00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:52.837
Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes.

180
00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.256
Be strong...

181
00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:55.799
I am afraid!

182
00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:57.926
Be strong.

183
00:28:56.359 --> 00:28:57.359
Tie him up!

184
00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:16.398
Father!

185
00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:19.943
The others. I have to help.

186
00:30:21.111 --> 00:30:22.821
No, don't leave us!

187
00:30:23.113 --> 00:30:25.782
I will come back, I promise.

188
00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:27.283
Don't you leave!

189
00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:28.451
I promise.

190
00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:29.493
Stay, please stay.

191
00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:30.787
Father, don't go.

192
00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:28.803
Very nice.

193
00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:16.851
Stop!

194
00:32:25.652 --> 00:32:26.945
Tie him up!

195
00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:32.742
I want him alive.

196
00:32:53.263 --> 00:32:54.556
Sorry Father.

197
00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:15.577
That's enough!

198
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.964
Stand him up.

199
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.307
Move away.

200
00:33:51.154 --> 00:33:52.947
My son.

201
00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:05.627
Don't be afraid.

202
00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:06.396
<i>Almost...</i>

203
00:35:21.327 --> 00:35:23.913
<i>that's your name.</i>

204
00:35:24.914 --> 00:35:28.084
"Almost".

205
00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:46.436
Our life is over.

206
00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:53.151
<i>Shame...</i>

207
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.452
Shame!

208
00:36:06.622 --> 00:36:08.666
Cowards!

209
00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:44.131
Let's move!

210
00:42:03.813 --> 00:42:05.147
We move out now.

211
00:42:05.564 --> 00:42:06.982
They are back.

212
00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:11.362
Get up!

213
00:42:14.156 --> 00:42:15.616
Heave!

214
00:42:22.832 --> 00:42:25.543
Cut Rock, you forgot to duck.

215
00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:29.839
Hold still.

216
00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:40.683
Can you see?

217
00:42:43.102 --> 00:42:44.102
Yes.

218
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.313
Get back to your line.

219
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:48.918
<i>Come with us...</i>

220
00:44:41.303 --> 00:44:42.471
Get up.

221
00:44:55.067 --> 00:44:57.319
E h' lm alone "A <i>'</i> ll11Qstn."

222
00:44:59.488 --> 00:45:01.365
I said get up.

223
00:45:29.935 --> 00:45:31.687
<i>Up, up...</i>

224
00:45:32.187 --> 00:45:33.731
<i>that's it.</i>

225
00:45:35.858 --> 00:45:37.192
Let's go!

226
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:43.991
This man is a good friend of yours...

227
00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:20.861
<i>Don't worry...</i>

228
00:46:24.406 --> 00:46:26.408
I'll take care of them.

229
00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:31.622
They are mine now.

230
00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:42.966
Gentle Ixchel. Tender mother of mercy.

231
00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:49.932
Keep them from harm. Please. Keep them.

232
00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:27.469
One more.

233
00:47:51.076 --> 00:47:52.786
Ready?

234
00:48:53.722 --> 00:48:55.265
Hold on! Hold on!

235
00:48:59.228 --> 00:49:00.771
<i>Wait...</i>

236
00:49:02.314 --> 00:49:04.107
let's see what happens.

237
00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:13.115
That's it!

238
00:49:20.249 --> 00:49:21.458
Hurry!

239
00:49:22.417 --> 00:49:24.378
Pull! Be strong!

240
00:49:43.438 --> 00:49:45.274
Yes! You did it!

241
00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:50.779
Good work!

242
00:50:03.625 --> 00:50:06.336
<i>Can you breathe?...Good.</i>

243
00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:37.158
Wait here.

244
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.069
What's become of my capture?

245
00:51:15.864 --> 00:51:17.324
Dead weight.

246
00:51:19.034 --> 00:51:21.244
He nearly took the rest with him.

247
00:51:23.538 --> 00:51:25.207
I let him go.

248
00:51:29.461 --> 00:51:31.213
You. Let him go?

249
00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:41.765
Shall we now do what you want?

250
00:51:46.103 --> 00:51:49.064
Let us try that.

251
00:52:12.337 --> 00:52:15.132
Don't let any others go.

252
00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:23.098
Let's move.

253
00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:40.490
Get up "Almost".

254
00:52:41.616 --> 00:52:45.162
We don't want to lose you just yet.

255
00:53:35.337 --> 00:53:37.339
Stand up, boy.

256
00:53:46.098 --> 00:53:48.642
You proved yourself today, my son.

257
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:53.146
You're now worthy to stand
with the rest of us.

258
00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:58.235
Thank you Father.

259
00:54:08.286 --> 00:54:09.704
<i>Take it...</i>

260
00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:11.665
<i>it's yours.</i>

261
00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:18.380
It has taken many lives.

262
00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:32.227
Get some rest.

263
00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:47.909
<i>Resting brothers...</i>

264
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.538
<i>fathers, mothers, wives.</i>

265
00:54:52.581 --> 00:54:56.751
You felt the cold
of this day's early morning.

266
00:54:57.669 --> 00:55:01.882
Now you cannot feel
the coldness of its night.

267
00:55:04.593 --> 00:55:06.595
She stopped screaming...

268
00:55:08.763 --> 00:55:11.766
too long before they returned,
she had stopped screaming.

269
00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:15.270
We saw how she fought them.

270
00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:18.148
But in the final moment?

271
00:55:19.774 --> 00:55:21.651
If she let them...

272
00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:28.950
<i>the</i> Goddess of the Scaffold
shows no mercy for the weakness...

273
00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:35.457
Her soul waits for yours
in the shade of the Ceiba Tree.

274
00:55:46.635 --> 00:55:48.345
I need to know.

275
00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:54.643
Before this day's end
I will leave this world.

276
00:55:56.561 --> 00:56:02.025
I will take as many
of these bastard dogs with me as I can.

277
00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:09.157
And I will gladly embrace
the torments of hell...

278
00:56:11.326 --> 00:56:14.704
<i>if</i> I do not find my Sky Flower there.

279
00:56:21.753 --> 00:56:23.213
Don't rain.

280
00:57:06.548 --> 00:57:08.383
I am walking here.

281
00:57:41.166 --> 00:57:43.209
Keep away, she has the sickness.

282
00:58:08.777 --> 00:58:10.445
Get back!

283
00:59:03.331 --> 00:59:05.500
You fear me?

284
00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:09.504
So you should...

285
00:59:10.171 --> 00:59:13.550
all you who are vile.

286
00:59:16.594 --> 00:59:20.140
Would you like to know how you will die?

287
00:59:27.188 --> 00:59:31.025
The sacred time is near...

288
00:59:33.194 --> 00:59:37.365
Beware the blackness of day.

289
00:59:40.535 --> 00:59:45.331
Beware the man who brings the jaguar.

290
00:59:48.209 --> 00:59:52.881
Behold him reborn from mud and earth...

291
00:59:53.965 --> 00:59:59.846
For the one he takes you to
will cancel the sky...

292
01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:03.850
and scratch out the earth.

293
01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:07.270
Scratch you out.

294
01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:11.232
And end your world.

295
01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:20.950
He's with us now.

296
01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:30.752
Day will be like night.

297
01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:35.882
And the man jaguar
will lead you to your end.

298
01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:49.122
Where are they taking us?

299
01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:57.839
We tell stories of a place stone-built.

300
01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.883
What happens there?

301
01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.219
I do not know...

302
01:02:04.762 --> 01:02:08.308
but the earth bleeds.

303
01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:13.229
We are near.

304
01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.564
Salvation!

305
01:02:57.148 --> 01:03:00.234
He has the laughing sickness.

306
01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:03.237
He likes you!

307
01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:07.075
Help me!

308
01:03:15.416 --> 01:03:17.251
Save me.

309
01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:26.761
Die like a man.

310
01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:08.422
Welcome back.

311
01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:11.050
Have you been successful?

312
01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:12.760
Ask my son.

313
01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.055
How many captives?

314
01:06:16.264 --> 01:06:17.265
Deal with my son.

315
01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:20.434
A fair price.

316
01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:23.604
As always, trust me.

317
01:06:24.438 --> 01:06:25.438
Good.

318
01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:45.668
How much will you give me?

319
01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:49.315
Who will buy this woman?

320
01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:51.734
No... she's too old.

321
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.862
She can be useful.

322
01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:57.073
<i>She can cook... clean...</i>

323
01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:00.701
Useless old woman!

324
01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:05.873
No sale.

325
01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.005
Go!

326
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.383
Go on.

327
01:13:16.183 --> 01:13:20.479
These are the days of our great lament.

328
01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:26.860
The land thirsts.

329
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.701
A great plague infests our crops.

330
01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:40.582
The scourge of sickness
afflicts us at whim.

331
01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:50.217
They say this strife has made us weak.

332
01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:54.263
That we have become empty.

333
01:13:57.057 --> 01:13:59.351
They say that we rot.

334
01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:13.907
Great people of the banner of the sun...

335
01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:16.243
I say...

336
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:19.246
we are strong.

337
01:14:23.751 --> 01:14:25.794
We are a people of destiny.

338
01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:33.886
Destined to be the masters of time.

339
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:41.226
Destined to be nearest to the gods.

340
01:14:57.159 --> 01:15:00.287
Mighty Kukulkan!

341
01:15:01.955 --> 01:15:06.460
Whose fury could scorch
this earth to oblivion...

342
01:15:09.129 --> 01:15:11.423
Let us appease you with this sacrifice.

343
01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:13.801
To exalt you in your glory.

344
01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:17.304
To make our people prosper.

345
01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:21.141
To prepare for your return.

346
01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.980
Warrior, unafraid and willing!

347
01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.858
With your blood you renew the world!

348
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:32.194
From age to age.

349
01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:35.280
Thanks be to you.

350
01:15:50.003 --> 01:15:52.172
The heart of god!

351
01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:38.171
Come back to me.

352
01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:48.974
Brother...

353
01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:52.686
Journey well...

354
01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:55.855
No.

355
01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:58.358
I can't go.

356
01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.486
Not <i>now...</i>

357
01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:26.047
People of the banner
of the sun do not fear.

358
01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:28.842
Rejoice!

359
01:21:30.093 --> 01:21:33.138
Kukulkan has drunk his fill of blood.

360
01:21:33.513 --> 01:21:36.308
We have sated his thirst.

361
01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:39.144
Great god.

362
01:21:40.103 --> 01:21:42.355
Show us that you are pleased.

363
01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:46.193
Let your light return upon us.

364
01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:53.635
What of these captives?

365
01:22:58.348 --> 01:23:00.267
Dispose of them.

366
01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.845
I need a finisher.

367
01:23:41.892 --> 01:23:43.184
You.

368
01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:50.859
Release them.

369
01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:00.785
You watch.

370
01:24:21.681 --> 01:24:22.724
I'm ready!

371
01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.690
There's your jungle beyond the corn.

372
01:24:33.693 --> 01:24:35.070
Go to it.

373
01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.322
You're free...

374
01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:40.533
<i>now</i> run.

375
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:45.205
I said run.

376
01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:50.877
Run!

377
01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:05.618
Not bad.

378
01:26:23.803 --> 01:26:25.138
Your turn.

379
01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:34.481
Run.

380
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:51.850
Run!

381
01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:07.926
Sleep.

382
01:29:08.885 --> 01:29:11.137
Sleep, sleep now my son.

383
01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.515
The pain will be no more.

384
01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:17.769
Sleep.

385
01:35:07.827 --> 01:35:09.996
He didn't come this way.

386
01:35:23.259 --> 01:35:25.219
He's in the trees.

387
01:35:27.013 --> 01:35:28.222
Spread out.

388
01:35:29.098 --> 01:35:30.641
Keep your eyes up.

389
01:35:53.039 --> 01:35:54.081
Quiet.

390
01:36:05.718 --> 01:36:06.886
He's coming right at us.

391
01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:24.611
There!

392
01:38:22.521 --> 01:38:25.232
He would have wanted me to have it.

393
01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:30.362
The omen is bad...

394
01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:35.367
Mighty Ek Chuah we beg you...

395
01:38:36.619 --> 01:38:40.873
Forgive us for this trespass
against your son the jaguar.

396
01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:45.377
The omen is bad...

397
01:38:47.087 --> 01:38:49.048
Lift yourself up Drunkards Four...

398
01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:52.927
the omen was foretold...

399
01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:58.516
and now we have a fear more grave...

400
01:38:59.475 --> 01:39:02.895
today I saw the day
become like night...

401
01:39:09.401 --> 01:39:13.072
I saw a man run with the jaguar...

402
01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:21.080
we must not let this man
make feet from us.

403
01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:22.957
Enough.

404
01:39:26.752 --> 01:39:28.587
Your words mean nothing.

405
01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:32.216
He runs because he is afraid.

406
01:39:33.592 --> 01:39:37.221
When I catch him,
I will peel his skin...

407
01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:42.977
and have him watch me wear it.

408
01:39:50.693 --> 01:39:51.944
We leave now.

409
01:41:59.571 --> 01:42:00.739
Stay back.

410
01:43:11.685 --> 01:43:12.811
Here!

411
01:43:37.377 --> 01:43:39.505
The omen was bad...

412
01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:44.343
He's fucked.

413
01:43:47.679 --> 01:43:49.056
Help... please...

414
01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.183
Hanging Moss...

415
01:43:52.851 --> 01:43:54.478
See him out.

416
01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:18.585
Open your veins. It's quicker.

417
01:44:31.306 --> 01:44:33.392
Travel well.

418
01:47:39.244 --> 01:47:41.955
So much for your prophecies.

419
01:47:47.836 --> 01:47:49.087
It's not over!

420
01:48:15.113 --> 01:48:16.740
I am jaguar Paw...

421
01:48:17.449 --> 01:48:18.992
Son of Flint Sky...

422
01:48:20.452 --> 01:48:23.789
My father hunted
this forest before me...

423
01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:27.501
My name is jaguar Paw.

424
01:48:28.335 --> 01:48:29.961
I am a hunter.

425
01:48:31.546 --> 01:48:33.799
This is my forest.

426
01:48:34.966 --> 01:48:39.513
And my sons will hunt it
with their sons after I am gone...

427
01:48:42.391 --> 01:48:43.642
Come on!

428
01:48:46.311 --> 01:48:47.979
We are going over.

429
01:48:48.563 --> 01:48:51.316
We climb down around.

430
01:48:52.567 --> 01:48:54.653
We cannot let him get away.

431
01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:56.488
We cannot afford...

432
01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:18.844
We all jump.

433
01:52:15.854 --> 01:52:17.522
I am jaguar Paw.

434
01:52:19.357 --> 01:52:21.192
This is my forest.

435
01:52:23.278 --> 01:52:25.989
And I am not afraid.

436
01:54:33.408 --> 01:54:35.994
You go. I'll wait here.

437
02:00:05.490 --> 02:00:07.325
Almost...

438
02:00:34.185 --> 02:00:36.854
Resting fathers, fly me your strength.

439
02:01:03.881 --> 02:01:05.675
Get up here.

440
02:01:20.565 --> 02:01:22.108
Go back!

441
02:01:51.512 --> 02:01:52.512
Quick!

442
02:01:52.805 --> 02:01:53.805
Hurry up!

443
02:08:20.651 --> 02:08:22.486
What are they?

444
02:08:24.154 --> 02:08:25.990
They bring men.

445
02:08:30.661 --> 02:08:32.538
Should we go to them?

446
02:08:40.838 --> 02:08:42.673
We should go to the forest.

447
02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:51.473
To seek a new beginning.

448
02:08:56.604 --> 02:08:58.022
Come Turtles Run...
