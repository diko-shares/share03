Maybe it's for the best.
He's not exactly king material.

712
00:42:13.824 --> 00:42:15.409
When were you planning on telling him

713
00:42:15.492 --> 00:42:17.327
that you were really supposed
to be king?

714
00:42:17.411 --> 00:42:19.996
Oh, come on. Now why would I do that?

715
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.041
Besides, he'll be 10 times
better at it than me.

Hey, whoa, Shrek.

717

to change your tactics

And at the request of my therapist

and the school authorities,
I've retired to the tranquility of nature

753

Now, which way am I kicking?

774
00:45:13.128 --> 00:45:15.797
I could tell you,
but since you're in the midst

775

776
00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:20.176
it would be karmically irresponsible.
