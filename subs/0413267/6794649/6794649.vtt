Oh!

369
00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:32.120
I can't believe
I'm going to be a father.

370
00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:34.372
How did this happen?

371
00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:36.041
Allow me to explain.

372
00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:39.085
You see, when a man has
certain feelings for a woman,

373
00:23:39.252 --> 00:23:41.671
a powerful urge sweeps over him.

374
00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:43.840
I know how it happened.

375
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.344
I just can't believe it.

376
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.473

You know I love Fiona, boss. Right?

it's the kid's.

I mean, when have you ever heard
the phrase "as sweet as an ogre,"

or "as nurturing as an ogre,"

393

or how about, "You're gonna love
my dad. He's a real ogre"?

OK. OK. I get it.

But at least you got us to help you out.

- It's Worcestershire.
- Like the sauce?

Mmm.

Well, my stomach aches,
and my palms just got sweaty.

00:25:45.712 --> 00:25:48.048
- Must be a high school.
- High school?

00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:49.674
- Ready?
- [all] OK!

414

Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?

Yeah, we think so! We think so!

I'm already starting to feel nauseous
from memories of wedgies and swirlies!

424
00:26:19.204 --> 00:26:21.247
But how did you receive the wedgies

425
00:26:21.414 --> 00:26:23.583
when you are clearly
not a wearer of the underpants?

426
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.836
Let's just say some things are better
left unsaid and leave it at that.

427
00:26:27.003 --> 00:26:29.130
So then I was all like,
"I'd rather get the black plague

428
00:26:29.297 --> 00:26:31.299
and lock myself in an iron maiden
than go out with you."

- Pardon me.

- Yeah, totally.

Yes! I just altered my character level
to +3 superb-ability.

00:26:40.683 --> 00:26:43.478
Hi. We're looking for someone named...

434
00:26:43.645 --> 00:26:45.313
Gee, who rolled a +9 dork spell

435
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.357
and summoned the beast
and his quadrupeds?

I know you're busy not fitting in,

438
00:26:51.569 --> 00:26:54.614
but can either of you tell me
where I can find Arthur?

439
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:56.407
He's over there.

on thy tongue than victory!

Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

444
00:27:25.937 --> 00:27:28.606
Does Arthur look like a king or what?

00:27:28.773 --> 00:27:30.066
[grunting]

446
00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:31.901
Sorry.

447
00:27:32.527 --> 00:27:35.029
Did you just say
you were looking for Arthur?

448
00:27:35.196 --> 00:27:37.157
That information
is on a need-to-know basis.

449
00:27:37.323 --> 00:27:38.950
It's top secret! Hushity-hush!

450
00:27:39.534 --> 00:27:42.662
Now, gentlemen, let's away.
To the showers!

00:27:45.832 --> 00:27:49.085
Greetings, Your Majesty.
This is your lucky day.

452
00:27:49.878 --> 00:27:51.713
So what, for like,
are you supposed to be?

453
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.924
Some kind of giant,
mutant leprechaun or something?

[all laughing]

455
00:27:56.593 --> 00:27:59.512
Giant mutant... You made a funny.

456
00:28:00.555 --> 00:28:02.348
Unhand me, monster!

457
00:28:02.515 --> 00:28:04.934
Stop squirming, Arthur.

458
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:06.895
I'm not Arthur.

459
00:28:08.938 --> 00:28:11.524
I am Lancelot.

460
00:28:11.691 --> 00:28:14.360
That dork over there is Arthur.

This is, like, totally embarrassing,

463
00:28:22.619 --> 00:28:25.580
but my friend Tiffany thinkest
thou vex her so soothly.

464
00:28:25.747 --> 00:28:27.498
And she thought perchance
thou would wanna ask her

465
00:28:27.665 --> 00:28:29.083
to the Homecoming Dance
or something.

466
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.919
- Excuse me?
- It's like, whatever.

467
00:28:31.085 --> 00:28:34.422
She's just totally into college guys,
and mythical creatures, and stuff.

468
00:28:37.634 --> 00:28:39.594
Oh, Arthur,

469
00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:43.056
come out, come out, wherever you are!

you little punk no-goodniks!

Donkey Dumpy Drawers are over!

00:29:00.114 --> 00:29:02.575
We're here for the mascot contest.

475
00:29:06.663 --> 00:29:09.832
We're here for the mascot contest, too.

476
00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:11.251
This is a costume?

478
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.004
Worked on it all night long.

479
00:29:15.672 --> 00:29:17.382
[sighing] Looks pretty real to me.

480
00:29:17.548 --> 00:29:19.968
If he were real, could I do this?

481
00:29:20.134 --> 00:29:21.844
[exclaiming]

482
00:29:22.011 --> 00:29:23.179
Or this?

[groaning]

484
00:29:24.764 --> 00:29:29.686
If it were real, that would have been
agonizingly painful.

485
00:29:29.852 --> 00:29:32.855
- Now watch this!
- That's quite enough, boys.

486
00:29:33.147 --> 00:29:36.651
Thank you to Professor Primbottom
and his invigorating lecture

on how to just say "nay."

488
00:29:39.404 --> 00:29:41.447
And now, without further ado,

489
00:29:41.614 --> 00:29:43.658
let's give a warm
Worcestershire hoozah

490
00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:47.203

That's right. I'm the new mascot.

and beat the other guys

This is all indeed a bit unorthodox...

498

Now, where can
I find Arthur Pendragon?

Classic.

502
00:30:20.903 --> 00:30:22.572
You should be ashamed of yourself!

503
00:30:22.739 --> 00:30:24.782
I didn't do it. They did.

[all] Aw!

00:30:39.589 --> 00:30:42.008
It's time to pack up your toothbrush
and jammies.

00:30:42.175 --> 00:30:44.594
You're the new King of Far Far Away.

511

What?

Is this for real?

518
00:31:02.445 --> 00:31:06.783
Absolutely. Now clean out your locker,
kid. You've got a kingdom to run.

519
00:31:06.949 --> 00:31:09.619
So, wait. I'm really the only heir?

520
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.830
The one and only.

521
00:31:13.581 --> 00:31:15.541
Give me just a second.

522
00:31:17.752 --> 00:31:19.379
My good people,

523
00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:22.340
I think there's a lesson here
for all of us.

524
00:31:22.507 --> 00:31:25.551
Maybe the next time you're about
to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot,

525
00:31:25.718 --> 00:31:29.389
you'll stop and think,
"Hey, maybe this guy has feelings.

526
00:31:30.139 --> 00:31:32.517
Maybe I should cut him some slack.

527

this guy's gonna turn out to be,
I don't know, a king.

And maybe his first royal decree

530
00:31:42.777 --> 00:31:44.821
will be to banish everyone
who ever picked on him."

531
00:31:44.987 --> 00:31:47.490
That's right.
I'm looking at you, jousting team!

532
00:31:48.408 --> 00:31:49.700
And Guin?

533
00:31:50.368 --> 00:31:51.661
Oh, Guin.

You just overdid it.

543
00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.939
- Stunning.
- Look at you!

544
00:32:20.106 --> 00:32:23.317
- You look darling.
- Just precious. Look at her.

545
00:32:23.484 --> 00:32:26.362
So have you had any cravings
since you've been pregnant?

546
00:32:26.529 --> 00:32:28.531
No. Not at all.

548
00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:31.868
Do you smell ham?

549
00:32:32.034 --> 00:32:34.620
It's present time!

550
00:32:36.247 --> 00:32:40.668
Oh, Fiona, won't you please open
mine first? It's the one in front.

551
00:32:41.335 --> 00:32:43.254
"Congratulations on your new mess..."

552
00:32:43.421 --> 00:32:45.339
Oh, mess maker!

553
00:32:45.506 --> 00:32:48.301
"Hopefully this helps.
Love, Cinderella."

- Would you look at that!
- What is it?

556
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:54.599
It's for the poopies.

557
00:32:54.765 --> 00:32:55.808
Ew!

558
00:32:55.975 --> 00:32:59.103
- Wait. Babies poop?
- Everyone poops, Beauty.

- [pig 1] Fiona!
- [pig 2] Fiona!

00:33:00.605 --> 00:33:03.608
We all chipped in
for a little present, too.

00:33:06.736 --> 00:33:09.739
You know the baby's gonna love it,
because I do!

564
00:33:09.906 --> 00:33:12.575
You guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.

565
00:33:13.367 --> 00:33:14.327
Who's this one from?

566
00:33:14.494 --> 00:33:16.954
I got you the biggest one,
because I love you the most.

567
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:20.416
"Have one on me. Love, Snow White."

568
00:33:23.794 --> 00:33:25.421
What is it?

569
00:33:25.588 --> 00:33:28.257
- He's a live-in babysitter.
- Where's the baby?

570
00:33:28.424 --> 00:33:32.386
You're too kind, Snow,
but I can't accept this.

571
00:33:32.553 --> 00:33:34.889
Think nothing of it.
I've got six more at home.

572
00:33:35.056 --> 00:33:36.766
- What does he do?
- The cleaning.

573
00:33:36.933 --> 00:33:38.518
- The feeding.
- The burping.

574
00:33:38.684 --> 00:33:40.770
So, what are Shrek
and I supposed to do?

575
00:33:40.937 --> 00:33:43.439
Well, now you'll have plenty of time
to work on your marriage.

576
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.944
Gee. Thanks, Rapunzel,
and what's that supposed to mean?

I'm sorry, but how many of you
have kids?

She's right!

586
00:34:06.754 --> 00:34:11.259
A baby is only gonna strengthen
the love that Shrek and Fiona have.

587
00:34:11.425 --> 00:34:14.095
How did Shrek react when you told him?
Tell me.

588
00:34:14.262 --> 00:34:18.516
Well, when he first found out,
Shrek said...

[growling]

590
00:34:31.445 --> 00:34:33.364

Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan.

- Shut it, Wendy.

You go and take care of the baby!

We're all going to die!

Quickly, ladies!

00:36:08.501 --> 00:36:11.212
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

Where are Shrek and Fiona?

609
00:36:28.813 --> 00:36:30.773
- The name doesn't ring a bell.
- Yeah.

610
00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.608
No bell.

611
00:36:32.775 --> 00:36:35.945
I suggest you freaks cooperate

612
00:36:36.112 --> 00:36:38.614
with the new King of Far Far Away!

613

The only thing you're ever gonna be
king of is King of the Stupids!

- Hook!
- Right!

615
00:36:45.413 --> 00:36:47.623
Avast, ye cookie.

616
00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:49.625
Oh.

617
00:36:50.292 --> 00:36:51.752

You can't lie.

So tell me, puppet, where is Shrek?

627

Well, I don't know where he's not.

628
00:37:34.128 --> 00:37:36.255
You're telling me
you don't know where Shrek is?

629
00:37:36.422 --> 00:37:38.507
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume

630
00:37:38.674 --> 00:37:43.512
that I couldn't exactly not say that is
or isn't almost partially incorrect.

631
00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:45.055
So you do know where he is!

632
00:37:45.222 --> 00:37:47.850
On the contrary,
I'm possibly more or less

not definitely rejecting the idea

634
00:37:50.311 --> 00:37:54.064

If that indeed wasn't where he isn't.

I can't believe it. Me, a king?

651
00:38:45.407 --> 00:38:48.619
I mean, I knew I came
from royalty and all,

652
00:38:48.786 --> 00:38:50.955
but I just figured everyone
forgot about me.

653

Oh, no. In fact, the King
asked for you personally.

Look, I know
it's not all gonna be fun and games.

It really is all fun and games,
actually.

657
00:39:04.051 --> 00:39:07.805
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes,
launch a ship or two.

you'll have the royal food tasters.

Oh, yeah? What do they do?

668
00:39:36.458 --> 00:39:41.130
They taste the food before the King eats
to make sure it's not poisoned.

- Poisoned?
- Or too salty.

Don't worry about it. You'll be safe and
sound with the help of your bodyguards.

Maybe it's for the best.
He's not exactly king material.

714
00:42:10.821 --> 00:42:12.322
When were you planning on telling him

715
00:42:12.489 --> 00:42:14.241
that you were really supposed
to be king?

716
00:42:14.408 --> 00:42:16.910
Oh, come on. Now why would I do that?

717
00:42:17.077 --> 00:42:19.955
Besides, he'll be 10 times
better at it than me.

718
00:42:20.122 --> 00:42:21.290
Hey, whoa, Shrek.

719
00:42:21.457 --> 00:42:22.958
Then you're gonna have
to change your tactics

720
00:42:23.125 --> 00:42:24.918
if you want to get anywhere
with this kid.

721
00:42:25.085 --> 00:42:26.545
[sighing]

722
00:42:26.712 --> 00:42:28.547
You're right, Donkey.

723
00:42:30.799 --> 00:42:32.509
What about this?

724
00:42:32.676 --> 00:42:36.096
- Shrek!
- Come on. It's just a joke.

725
00:42:36.263 --> 00:42:37.890
[chuckling]

726
00:42:38.057 --> 00:42:39.308
Still...

727
00:42:55.949 --> 00:42:58.118
Listen, Artie.

728
00:42:58.285 --> 00:43:03.290
If you think this whole mad scene
ain't dope, I feel you, dude.

729
00:43:03.457 --> 00:43:07.503
I mean, I'm not trying to get up in your
grill, or raise your roof, or whatever.

730
00:43:07.669 --> 00:43:09.088
But what I am screamin' is,

731
00:43:09.254 --> 00:43:13.175
yo, check out this
kazing thazing, bazaby!

732
00:43:13.342 --> 00:43:15.886
I mean, if it doesn't groove,
or what I'm saying

733
00:43:16.053 --> 00:43:18.514
ain't straight trippin', just say,
"Oh, no, you didn't!

734
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.016
You know,
you're getting on my last nerve."

735
00:43:21.183 --> 00:43:24.353
And then I'll know it's...
Then I'll know it's wack!

736
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.854
[exclaiming]

737
00:43:26.021 --> 00:43:27.147
[Artie] Somebody help!

738
00:43:27.314 --> 00:43:29.900
I've been kidnapped by a monster
who's trying to relate to me!

739
00:43:30.067 --> 00:43:34.404
- Artie, Artie, wait, wait, wait.
- Come on! Come on. Help! Help! Hello?

740
00:43:34.571 --> 00:43:35.572
[exclaiming]

741
00:43:35.739 --> 00:43:39.201
Greetings, cosmic children
of the universe.

742
00:43:39.368 --> 00:43:41.662
Welcome to my serenity circle.

743
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:45.958
Please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex.

744
00:43:46.125 --> 00:43:48.168
Now prepare...

745
00:43:51.713 --> 00:43:52.881
[groaning]

746
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:56.426
I knew I should have got that warranty!

747
00:43:56.885 --> 00:43:58.178
[groaning]

748
00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:00.639
Mr. Merlin?

749
00:44:00.806 --> 00:44:02.141
You know this guy?

750
00:44:02.307 --> 00:44:03.225
Yeah.

751
00:44:03.392 --> 00:44:06.979
He was the school's magic teacher
until he had his nervous breakdown.

752
00:44:07.146 --> 00:44:10.190
Technically, I was merely a victim
of a level-3 fatigue.

753
00:44:10.357 --> 00:44:12.442
And at the request of my therapist

754
00:44:12.609 --> 00:44:16.238
and the school authorities,
I've retired to the tranquility of nature

755
00:44:16.405 --> 00:44:18.699
to discover my divine purpose.

756
00:44:20.117 --> 00:44:23.412
Now, can I interest anyone
in a snack or beverage?

757
00:44:23.579 --> 00:44:24.538
No.

758
00:44:24.705 --> 00:44:27.875
Sure you don't want to try
my famous Rock Au Gratin?

759
00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:30.085
[crunching]

760
00:44:31.128 --> 00:44:32.296
It's organic.

761
00:44:32.462 --> 00:44:35.048
Thanks. I just ate a boulder
on the way in.

762
00:44:35.215 --> 00:44:38.051
What we need are directions
back to Far Far Away.

763
00:44:38.218 --> 00:44:40.470
What's with the "we"?
Who said I was going with you?

764
00:44:40.637 --> 00:44:41.763
I did.

765
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:43.724
'Cause there's a lot of people
counting on you,

766
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:45.184
so don't try and weasel out of it.

767
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.936
If it's such a great job,
why don't you do it?

768
00:44:48.103 --> 00:44:52.316
Understand this, kid. It's no more
Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.

769
00:44:52.482 --> 00:44:54.276
Oh! So that was your Mr. Nice Guy?

770
00:44:54.443 --> 00:44:57.029
I know, and I'm going to miss him.

771
00:44:57.196 --> 00:45:01.033
You know what? Why don't you go
terrorize a village and leave me alone!

772
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.660
Was that some kind of crack
about ogres?

773
00:45:03.827 --> 00:45:05.787
You get your royal highness
to Far Far Away

774
00:45:05.954 --> 00:45:07.331
before I kick it there!

775
00:45:07.497 --> 00:45:09.958
Now, which way am I kicking?

776
00:45:10.125 --> 00:45:12.711
I could tell you,
but since you're in the midst

777
00:45:12.878 --> 00:45:15.047
of a self-destructive rage spiral,

778
00:45:15.214 --> 00:45:17.090
it would be karmically irresponsible.

779
00:45:17.257 --> 00:45:21.303
Self-destructive...
Look, are you going to help us or not?

780
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:24.139
Most definitely, but only after you

781
00:45:24.306 --> 00:45:27.517
take the journey to your soul!

782
00:45:27.684 --> 00:45:28.477
Yeah, I don't think so.

783
00:45:28.644 --> 00:45:32.898
Look, pal. It's either that
or some primal scream therapy.

784
00:45:33.065 --> 00:45:34.775
[screaming]

785
00:45:34.942 --> 00:45:37.611
All right. All right.
Journey to the soul.

786
00:45:38.403 --> 00:45:42.783
Now, all of you,
look into the Fire of Truth

787
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:45.494
and tell me what you see.

788
00:45:46.828 --> 00:45:48.830
[whooping]

789
00:45:48.997 --> 00:45:50.707
Ooh, charades!

790
00:45:50.874 --> 00:45:55.504
OK, I see a Dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls!

791
00:45:55.671 --> 00:45:57.881
OK, monster, go for it.

792
00:45:58.382 --> 00:46:00.342
[sighing]

793
00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:04.471
[baby crying]

794
00:46:07.224 --> 00:46:08.684
I see a rainbow pony.

795
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:12.521
- Excellent work! Now the boy.
- This is lame.

796
00:46:12.688 --> 00:46:15.023
You're lame! Just go for it.

797
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:16.358
[sighing]

798
00:46:16.525 --> 00:46:17.693
OK.

799
00:46:18.652 --> 00:46:22.281
There's a baby bird and a father bird
sitting in a nest.

800
00:46:22.906 --> 00:46:25.367
Yes! Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!

801
00:46:26.201 --> 00:46:28.287
Wait. The dad just flew away.

802
00:46:28.453 --> 00:46:30.872
Why did he leave
the little bird all alone?

803
00:46:31.039 --> 00:46:34.251
It's trying to fly,
but it doesn't know how to.

804
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:37.212
It's going to fall!

805
00:46:42.092 --> 00:46:45.846
Proper head case you are, aren't you?
Really messed up.

806
00:46:46.054 --> 00:46:47.347
Whoa!

807
00:46:47.806 --> 00:46:49.141
[door closing]

808
00:46:49.558 --> 00:46:53.603
Yeah, yeah. OK, I get it.
The bird's me. My dad left.

809
00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:55.063
So what?

810
00:47:06.533 --> 00:47:08.160
Look, Artie...

811
00:47:09.036 --> 00:47:10.996
["That's What Friends Are For"
playing]

812
00:47:13.582 --> 00:47:16.418
Just thought I might help set the mood,

813
00:47:16.585 --> 00:47:19.463
you know,
for your big heart-to-heart chat.

814
00:47:23.091 --> 00:47:24.718
[music stops]

815
00:47:24.885 --> 00:47:26.053
[door closing]

816
00:47:26.219 --> 00:47:27.596
[sighing]

817
00:47:28.347 --> 00:47:31.892
I know what it's like to not feel
ready for something.

818
00:47:33.894 --> 00:47:35.937
Even ogres get scared.

819
00:47:37.189 --> 00:47:39.816
You know, once in a while.

820
00:47:41.902 --> 00:47:45.280
I know you want me to be king,
but I can't.

821
00:47:45.864 --> 00:47:49.409
I'm not cut out for it,
and I never will be, all right?

822
00:47:49.576 --> 00:47:52.287
Even my own dad knew
I wasn't worth the trouble.

823
00:47:52.454 --> 00:47:55.957
He dumped me at that school
the first chance he got,

824
00:47:56.124 --> 00:47:58.502
and I never heard from him again.

825
00:47:58.668 --> 00:48:00.003
[sighing]

826
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:03.673
My dad wasn't really
the fatherly type, either.

827
00:48:04.424 --> 00:48:07.386
Well, I doubt he was worse than mine.

828
00:48:07.552 --> 00:48:08.678
Oh, yeah?

829
00:48:08.845 --> 00:48:11.014
My father was an ogre.

830
00:48:11.181 --> 00:48:12.933
He tried to eat me.

831
00:48:13.892 --> 00:48:15.977
Now I guess
I should have seen it coming.

832
00:48:16.144 --> 00:48:17.813
He used to give me a bath
in barbecue sauce

833
00:48:17.979 --> 00:48:20.440
and put me to bed
with an apple in my mouth.

834
00:48:20.607 --> 00:48:22.150
[laughing]

835
00:48:22.317 --> 00:48:24.778
OK, I guess that's pretty bad.

836
00:48:27.155 --> 00:48:28.949
You know, it may be hard to believe,

837
00:48:29.116 --> 00:48:32.285
what, with my obvious charm
and good looks,

838
00:48:32.452 --> 00:48:35.163
but people used to think
I was a monster.

839
00:48:36.164 --> 00:48:39.668
And for a long time, I believed them.

840
00:48:41.878 --> 00:48:43.213
But after a while,

841
00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:46.508
you learn to ignore the names
that people call you,

842
00:48:47.259 --> 00:48:49.594
and you just trust who you are.

843
00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:54.516
You know, you're OK, Shrek.

844
00:48:55.725 --> 00:49:00.021
You just need to do a little less
yelling and use a little more soap.

845
00:49:00.605 --> 00:49:02.107
Thanks, Artie.

846
00:49:02.274 --> 00:49:05.944
The soap's because
you stink really bad.

847
00:49:07.195 --> 00:49:09.531
[Shrek] Yeah, I got that.

848
00:49:12.826 --> 00:49:13.869
[Cinderella sniffing]

849
00:49:14.035 --> 00:49:16.246
This place is filthy!

850
00:49:16.955 --> 00:49:18.790
I feel like a hobo.

851
00:49:19.749 --> 00:49:22.377
I'm sorry,
but this just isn't working for me.

852
00:49:22.544 --> 00:49:25.255
Everything's always about you, isn't it?

853
00:49:25.422 --> 00:49:26.798
It's not like your attitude
is helping, Snow.

854
00:49:26.965 --> 00:49:30.802
Well, maybe it just bothers you
that I was voted fairest in the land.

855
00:49:30.969 --> 00:49:33.180
Oh. You mean in that rigged election?

856
00:49:33.346 --> 00:49:36.224
Give me a break.
"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

857
00:49:36.391 --> 00:49:38.935
let down thy golden extensions!"

00:49:39.102 --> 00:49:44.399
Ladies, let go of your petty complaints,
and let's work together!

859

[all groaning]

860
00:49:47.736 --> 00:49:50.405
[Snow White] So I guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly

861
00:49:50.572 --> 00:49:52.657
in this stinkhole until we rot.

862
00:49:52.824 --> 00:49:56.578
No, we're gonna get inside and find out
what Charming's up to.

863
00:49:56.745 --> 00:49:58.580
I know he's a jerk and everything,

864
00:49:58.747 --> 00:50:02.834
but I gotta admit that Charming
makes me hotter than July.

865

[all groaning]

866
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:06.296
That's it!

868
00:50:34.282 --> 00:50:36.284
Come on! This way!

869
00:50:36.451 --> 00:50:38.036
Rapunzel, wait!

870
00:50:47.462 --> 00:50:49.214
Charming, let go of her.

871
00:50:49.381 --> 00:50:51.800
But why would I want to do that?

872
00:50:52.592 --> 00:50:53.635
[purring]

873
00:50:53.802 --> 00:50:54.886

874
00:50:57.305 --> 00:50:58.306
What?

878
00:51:09.651 --> 00:51:10.652
Jealous much?

00:51:10.819 --> 00:51:11.903
[chuckling]

880
00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:14.281
Soon you'll be back where you started,

881
00:51:14.447 --> 00:51:16.950
scrubbing floors
or locked away in towers.

882
00:51:17.117 --> 00:51:20.662
That is, if I let you last the week.

883
00:51:22.872 --> 00:51:25.542
But, pookie,
you promised you wouldn't hurt them.

884
00:51:25.709 --> 00:51:29.713
Not here, kitten whiskers.
Daddy will discuss it later.

885
00:51:30.839 --> 00:51:32.841
Now forgive us.
We have a show to put on.

886
00:51:33.008 --> 00:51:36.511
Shrek will be back soon, Charming,
and you'll be sorry.

887
00:51:36.678 --> 00:51:38.096
Sorry?

888
00:51:38.263 --> 00:51:42.559
Don't you realize
once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away,

889
00:51:42.726 --> 00:51:44.185
he's doomed?

890
00:51:52.694 --> 00:51:54.195
[gasping]

891
00:51:59.951 --> 00:52:01.036
[yawning]

892
00:52:01.202 --> 00:52:02.912
[whistling]

893
00:52:09.628 --> 00:52:11.755
[footsteps approaching]

894
00:52:16.885 --> 00:52:18.261
[screaming]

895
00:52:23.892 --> 00:52:25.518
Look out! They got a piano!

896
00:52:25.685 --> 00:52:29.022
Kill them all, except the fat one.

897
00:52:29.189 --> 00:52:33.234
King Charming has something
special in mind for you, ogre.

898
00:52:33.401 --> 00:52:34.819
King Charming?

899
00:52:34.986 --> 00:52:36.404
Attack!

900
00:52:40.742 --> 00:52:42.661
- Have at them!
- Come here, you!

901
00:52:42.827 --> 00:52:44.329
Artie, duck!

902
00:52:47.916 --> 00:52:48.917
[screaming]

903
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:53.421
[laughing]

904
00:52:58.385 --> 00:53:00.053
Ready the plank!

905
00:53:15.443 --> 00:53:16.986
- Shrek!
- Help!

906
00:53:36.423 --> 00:53:37.382
Cowards!

907
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:39.467
What has Charming done with Fiona?

908
00:53:39.634 --> 00:53:42.470
She's going to get what's coming to her.

909
00:53:43.304 --> 00:53:46.599
And there ain't nothing you can do
to stop him!

910
00:53:46.766 --> 00:53:48.101
[Captain Hook laughing]

911
00:53:48.268 --> 00:53:51.604
- We've got to save her.
- But she's so far far away!

912
00:53:52.313 --> 00:53:54.315
Get yourself back
to Worcestershire, kid.

913
00:53:54.482 --> 00:53:57.569
No, Shrek. Hold on a second.
I've got an idea.

914
00:53:57.736 --> 00:53:59.404
I am a buzzing bee.

915
00:53:59.571 --> 00:54:00.822
[buzzing]

916
00:54:00.989 --> 00:54:04.033
Mr. Merlin?
They need a spell to get them,

917
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.328
I mean us, back to Far Far Away.

918
00:54:07.495 --> 00:54:10.665
Forget it. I don't have that kind
of magic in me anymore, kid.

919
00:54:10.832 --> 00:54:14.502
How about a hug instead?
That's the best kind of magic.

920
00:54:14.669 --> 00:54:17.005
Mr. Merlin, please.
I know you can do it.

921
00:54:17.172 --> 00:54:19.132
I said forget it!

922
00:54:19.299 --> 00:54:20.550
But...

923
00:54:24.679 --> 00:54:26.014
[sobbing]

924
00:54:28.016 --> 00:54:29.601
What's with you?

925
00:54:30.894 --> 00:54:33.688
It's just so hard, you know?

926
00:54:34.856 --> 00:54:38.443
They really need to get back,
'cause their kingdom's in trouble.

927
00:54:39.068 --> 00:54:41.529
'Cause there's a really bad man.

928
00:54:41.696 --> 00:54:43.740
And it's just so hard!

929
00:54:43.907 --> 00:54:49.204
- Come on. Take it easy.
- No! I don't think you understand!

930
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:53.792
There's a mean person
doing mean things to good people.

931
00:54:53.958 --> 00:54:55.502
Oh, have a heart, old man.

932
00:54:55.668 --> 00:54:58.546
And they really need your help
to get them back.

933
00:54:58.713 --> 00:55:00.840
So why won't you help them?

934
00:55:01.007 --> 00:55:03.134
[mumbling]

935
00:55:04.219 --> 00:55:05.512
OK.

936
00:55:05.678 --> 00:55:07.680
I'll go and get my things.

937
00:55:08.848 --> 00:55:10.058
[clearing throat]

938
00:55:10.517 --> 00:55:13.353
- Piece of cake.
- Well, well, well.

939
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.230
You want some eggs with that ham?

940
00:55:15.396 --> 00:55:19.317
Now, I am a little rusty,
so there could be some side effects.

941
00:55:19.484 --> 00:55:20.652
- Side effects?
- Don't worry.

942
00:55:20.819 --> 00:55:24.364
Whatever it is, no matter how
excruciatingly painful it may be,

943
00:55:24.531 --> 00:55:27.408
it will wear off eventually. I think.

944
00:55:29.619 --> 00:55:31.955
- Oops.
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

945
00:55:32.121 --> 00:55:36.000
Look, if Artie trusts him,
that's good enough for me.

946
00:55:36.709 --> 00:55:38.419
Even if his robe
doesn't quite cover his...

947
00:55:38.586 --> 00:55:41.339
<i>Alacritous expeditious,</i>

948
00:55:41.506 --> 00:55:43.925
<i>a-zoomy-zoom-zoom!</i>

949
00:55:44.092 --> 00:55:46.928
Let's help our friends get back...

950
00:55:49.848 --> 00:55:51.099
Soon!

951
00:55:57.146 --> 00:55:58.398
[exclaiming]

952
00:55:58.565 --> 00:55:59.941
It worked!

953
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:12.120
[in Donkey's voice] Man, I haven't
been on a trip like that since college!

954
00:56:12.287 --> 00:56:13.538
Donkey?

955
00:56:13.705 --> 00:56:15.957
What? Is there something in my teeth?

956
00:56:16.124 --> 00:56:17.333
[gasping]

957
00:56:18.084 --> 00:56:19.878
What the... Oh, no!

958
00:56:20.044 --> 00:56:24.340
I've been abracadabra-ed into
a Fancy Feasting, second-rate sidekick!

959
00:56:24.924 --> 00:56:26.175
[groaning]

960
00:56:26.342 --> 00:56:27.635
[in Puss' voice] At least you don't look

961
00:56:27.802 --> 00:56:29.971
like some kind of bloated
roadside piñata!

962
00:56:30.138 --> 00:56:32.015
You really should think
about going on a diet!

963
00:56:32.181 --> 00:56:34.475
Yeah, you should think
about getting yourself a pair of pants.

964
00:56:34.642 --> 00:56:36.895
I feel all exposed and nasty!

965
00:56:37.061 --> 00:56:38.855
[laughing]

966
00:56:39.022 --> 00:56:41.357
So you two think this is funny?

967
00:56:43.568 --> 00:56:45.320
I'm really sorry, guys.

968
00:56:45.486 --> 00:56:47.822
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

969
00:56:51.993 --> 00:56:53.661
[groaning]

970
00:56:53.828 --> 00:56:55.872
How in the Hans Christian Andersen

971
00:56:56.039 --> 00:56:58.541
am I supposed to parade around
in these goofy boots?

972
00:56:58.708 --> 00:57:01.252
Hey, hey, hey!
Be very careful with those.

973
00:57:01.419 --> 00:57:02.837
[braying]

974
00:57:03.421 --> 00:57:05.632
They were made in Madrid
by the finest...

975
00:57:05.798 --> 00:57:07.133
[braying]

976
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:09.594
You'll learn to control that.
[sputtering]

977
00:57:12.013 --> 00:57:13.306
Seriously. Ow!

978
00:57:13.473 --> 00:57:17.352
Man, you need some comfort inserts,
or arch support, or something.

979
00:57:17.518 --> 00:57:18.645
[exclaiming]

980
00:57:23.066 --> 00:57:27.654
Hey, watch it. I'm walking here,
and I'm gonna keep going until...

981
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:29.864
- Pinocchio!
- [calliope playing festive music]

982
00:57:30.031 --> 00:57:32.116
- Shrek! Help me!
- Pinocchio!

983
00:57:32.283 --> 00:57:33.201
What's happened?

984
00:57:33.368 --> 00:57:35.411
Charming and the villains
have taken over everything.

985
00:57:35.578 --> 00:57:36.537
They attacked us.

986
00:57:36.704 --> 00:57:39.332
But Fiona and the Princesses got away.
And now she's...

987
00:57:39.499 --> 00:57:41.042
She's what? She's what?

988
00:57:42.961 --> 00:57:45.129
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

989
00:57:45.296 --> 00:57:47.340
Come on, Puss. You heard the man.
Help the brother out.

990
00:57:47.507 --> 00:57:49.717
Do you see any pockets on me?

991
00:57:49.884 --> 00:57:51.594
Hold on a second.

992
00:57:52.053 --> 00:57:53.388
Ah-ha!

993
00:57:54.138 --> 00:57:58.351
I had no idea, really. I swear.

994
00:57:59.811 --> 00:58:01.813
Quick, Pinocchio. Where is Fiona?

995
00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.399
Charming's got her
locked away someplace secret.

996
00:58:04.565 --> 00:58:05.650
You gotta find him!

997
00:58:05.817 --> 00:58:08.236
He's probably getting
ready for the show!

998
00:58:08.403 --> 00:58:11.197
Wait, wait, wait, Pinocchio! What show?

999
00:58:16.411 --> 00:58:18.454
<i>It's a Happily Ever After After All.</i>

1000
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:20.748
"Shrek's final performance"?

1001
00:58:20.915 --> 00:58:21.958
[exclaiming]

1002
00:58:22.125 --> 00:58:25.294
Shrek!
You didn't tell us you were in a play!

1003
00:58:25.461 --> 00:58:28.756
Well, I guess I've been so busy
I forgot to mention it.

1004
00:58:28.923 --> 00:58:30.758
It's the ogre! Get him!

1005
00:58:31.843 --> 00:58:33.386
Don't worry, jefe.

1006
00:58:33.553 --> 00:58:34.929
I got this.

1007
00:58:40.768 --> 00:58:42.895
Ugh! Kill it!

1008
00:58:43.479 --> 00:58:44.605
Look.

1009
00:58:44.772 --> 00:58:47.400
Don't you know who he thinks he is?

1010
00:58:47.567 --> 00:58:48.568
How dare you!

1011
00:58:48.735 --> 00:58:50.069
Donkey, we're dealing with amateurs.

1012
00:58:50.236 --> 00:58:53.322
He's a star, people! Hello?

1013
00:58:53.489 --> 00:58:55.283
I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

1014
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:56.784
I'm going to lose it!

1015
00:58:56.951 --> 00:58:59.203
I assume you have everything ready
for tonight.

1016
00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:01.122
You did get the list
for the dressing room?

1017
00:59:01.289 --> 00:59:04.042
Yeah, the breakfast croissant
stuffed with seared sashimi tuna.

1018
00:59:04.208 --> 00:59:07.336
And please tell me you at least have the
saffron-corn with jalapeno honey butter.

1019
00:59:07.503 --> 00:59:10.548
'Cause our client cannot get into
his proper emotional state

1020
00:59:10.715 --> 00:59:12.633
without his jalapeno honey butter!

1021
00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.052
I just lost it.

1022
00:59:14.218 --> 00:59:15.136
[hesitating]

1023
00:59:15.303 --> 00:59:17.388
Maybe they should talk to Nancy
in Human Resources.

1024
00:59:17.555 --> 00:59:20.808
We have much to say to Nancy,
I promise!

1025
00:59:21.476 --> 00:59:22.769
[piano playing ballet music]

1026
00:59:22.935 --> 00:59:25.313
[Prince Charming]
"With this sword, I do..."

1027
00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.481
No. "With...

1028
00:59:26.647 --> 00:59:30.902
With this sword, I do smote thee!"

1029
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:33.654
Is that the right word?
"Smote"? "Smoot"?

1030
00:59:33.821 --> 00:59:35.573
I don't think that's even a word,
actually.

1031
00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:39.994
Maybe I should just "smite" him.
Let's try this again. Now...

1032
00:59:40.161 --> 00:59:41.204
[mumbling]

1033
00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:45.166
Shrek attacks me.
I pretend to be afraid. Ooh!

1034
00:59:45.333 --> 00:59:48.044
I say, "Finally the kingdom will get
the happily ever after they deserve.

1035
00:59:48.211 --> 00:59:49.337
Die, ogre!"

1036
00:59:49.504 --> 00:59:53.508
Blah, blah, blah.
Oh, it just doesn't feel real enough yet!

1037
00:59:55.384 --> 00:59:57.512
Who told you to stop dancing?

1038
00:59:57.678 --> 00:59:58.805
Wink and turn.

1039
00:59:58.971 --> 01:00:01.224
What are you laying around for?
Get up! Honestly!

1040
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:02.391
[man groaning]

1041
01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:14.320
Our happily ever after
is nearly complete, Mommy.

1042
01:00:14.487 --> 01:00:16.572
And I assure you,

1043
01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:21.744
the people of this kingdom
will pay dearly for every second

1044
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:24.497
we've had to wait.

1046
01:00:26.249 --> 01:00:27.250
Break a leg.

1047
01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:30.503
Or on second thought,
let me break it for you.

1048
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:31.629
Thank goodness you're here.

1049
01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:34.841
I was beginning to think you might not
make it back in time.

1050
01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:36.425
Where's Fiona?

1051
01:00:36.592 --> 01:00:37.844
Don't worry.

1052
01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:40.763
She and the others are safe, for now.

1053
01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:49.897
Hmm.

1054
01:00:50.064 --> 01:00:53.568
Let me guess. Arthur.

1055
01:00:54.277 --> 01:00:56.195
It's Artie, actually.

1056
01:00:56.362 --> 01:01:01.033
This boy is supposed to be
the new King of Far Far Away?

1057
01:01:01.284 --> 01:01:02.451
[laughing]

1058
01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:04.579
How pathetic.

1059
01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:07.165
