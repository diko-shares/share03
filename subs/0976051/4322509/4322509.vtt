1
00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:10.027
[woman] You didn't wake me.

2
00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.072
You were sleeping.

3
00:01:13.157 --> 00:01:15.366
You can't bear
to have breakfast with me.

4
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:18.619
I've boiled you an egg. See?
I'd hardly have boiled you an egg

5
00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:22.457
if I didn't want to see you.
Um, tea or coffee?

6
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:24.584
Does any woman
ever stay long enough

7
00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:28.212
to find out what the hell
goes on in your head?

8
00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.923
What are you doing tonight?

9
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:32.925
I'm seeing my daughter.

10
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.679
Your daughter?
You've kept very quiet about her.

11
00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:38.890
Have I?

12
00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:42.351
Well, she's been abroad for a year.

13
00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.938
Did you say tea?

14
00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:47.732
I'm going.

15
00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:52.612
Have fun with your daughter.

16
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.573
[door shuts]

17
00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.459
[train approaching]

18
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.510
[brakes squealing]

19
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.310
[woman speaks German]

20
00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.145
[woman] Tickets, please.

21
00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.942
Tickets. Excuse me.

22
00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.240
Tickets.

23
00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:42.620
Tickets, please.

24
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.842
[panting]

25
00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.266
[gagging]

26
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.905
[thunder rumbles]

27
00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:22.326
[vomiting]

28
00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:43.306
[woman] Oh!

29
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.766
Hey. Hey, you!

30
00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:53.733
[faucet turning on]

31
00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.546
Your feet. Your feet.

32
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.514
[boy sobbing]

33
00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.067
Hey, kid.

34
00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:38.903
Up.

35
00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.366
It's all right.

36
00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:56.212
There. Where do you live?

37
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.596
It's just up here.
I'll be fine now. Thank you.

38
00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:08.683
Goodbye.

39
00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.318
Look after yourself.

40
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:29.161
I'm worried about him.
He looks terrible.

41
00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:31.664
The boy's saying
he doesn't need a doctor.

42
00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.666
- He does.
- I don't need a doctor.

43
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.043
- Good, then.
- Peter.

44
00:05:36.128 --> 00:05:39.505
We're not going to argue about this.

45
00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:44.010
Remind me.
How old are you, now?

46
00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.761
[mother] Michael's 15.

47
00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:48.681
- [doctor] It's scarlet fever.
- [sighs]

48
00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:51.684
[doctor] He'll be in bed
for several months, at least.

49
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.311
Complete isolation.

50
00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:57.606
Emily, keep away. He's contagious.

51
00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.277
Emily!

52
00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.962
[mother] How are you feeling?

53
00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.506
Better.

54
00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.259
I meant to tell you...

55
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.137
...the day I got ill, a woman helped me.

56
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.056
She helped you?

57
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.558
Yes. She brought me home.

58
00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:34.894
Do you have her address?

59
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:40.524
- [banging]
- [indistinct chatter]

60
00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:49.033
[men shouting in German]

61
00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.510
[woman singing in German on record]

62
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:14.225
- [Michael] Hello?
- [woman] Yes?

63
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.368
[music continues]

64
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.295
I brought you these flowers
to say thank you.

65
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.589
Put them over there in the sink.

66
00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:09.655
I would have come earlier,
I've been in bed three months.

67
00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:13.951
- You are better now?
- Yes. Thank you.

68
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:19.498
- Have you always been weak?
- Oh, no. I've never been sick before.

69
00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:23.794
It's incredibly boring.
There's nothing to do.

70
00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:26.213
I couldn't even be bothered to read.

71
00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:33.345
Well, thank you again.

72
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.016
Wait.

73
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.393
I'll walk with you.
I have to go to work.

74
00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.691
Wait in the hall while I change.

75
00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.665
[coin clatters on floor]

76
00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:44.750
[men chattering outside]

77
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:17.032
[women chattering]

78
00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.252
[woman shouts in German]

79
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.889
[man grunts]

80
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.066
[Michael gasps]

81
00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:15.841
[footsteps approaching]

82
00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:36.528
There are two more buckets downstairs.

83
00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.947
You can fill them and bring them up.

84
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.424
[Michael coughing]

85
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.301
[laughs]

86
00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.225
[woman laughing]

87
00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:09.478
You look ridiculous.
Look at you, kid.

88
00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.439
[laughs]

89
00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:14.858
You can't go home like that.

90
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.324
Take off your clothes.
I'll run you a bath.

91
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.330
[water running]

92
00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:45.848
Do you always take
a bath in your trousers?

93
00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.111
[clears throat]

94
00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:01.655
It's all right. I won't look.

95
00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.182
I'll get you a towel.

96
00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:11.285
[moans]

97
00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.996
[whispers] So that's
why you came back.

98
00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.640
[whispers] You're so beautiful.

99
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:37.853
[whispers] What are you talking about?

100
00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:49.239
Look at me, kid.

101
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.951
Mm! Mm!

102
00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:55.120
Slowly.

103
00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.414
Slowly...

104
00:15:57.498 --> 00:15:59.291
Shh.

105
00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.794
[silverware clattering]

106
00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.672
[blows, slurps]

107
00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.970
[clock ticking]

108
00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:13.889
[panting, moaning]

109
00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:19.102
[moaning]

110
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.235
[panting]

111
00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:36.495
You've inconvenienced your mother.

112
00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:40.624
How many more times?
I've said I'm sorry.

113
00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:42.918
- You scared her.
- I got lost, that's all.

114
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.337
That's why I was late.
Can I have some more?

115
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:47.839
How can anyone get lost
in their own hometown?

116
00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.926
I meant to head for the castle,
I ended up at the field.

117
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.969
- Opposite directions.
- None of your business.

118
00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:56.848
- He's lying.
- He's not lying.

119
00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.600
Michael never lies.

120
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.856
I've decided I want
to go back to school tomorrow.

121
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:08.151
- The doctor says you need three weeks.
- Well, I'm going.

122
00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.737
[mother] Peter?

123
00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:16.284
[sighs]

124
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.955
[children shouting]

125
00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.711
- Hey!
- Ooh!

126
00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:55.407
- [grunts]
- Like this?

127
00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.492
That's right.

128
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.996
[moans]

129
00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:04.666
No, not so fast.

130
00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.762
Ah!

131
00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:22.058
It's all right.

132
00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.102
Do it again.

133
00:18:26.689 --> 00:18:28.982
Mm...

134
00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:31.985
Oh!

135
00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:49.878
What's your name?

136
00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:52.756
- What?
- Your name.

137
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:58.053
- Why do you want to know?
- I've been here three times.

138
00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:03.016
I want to know your name.
What's wrong with that?

139
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.227
[laughs] Nothing, kid.

140
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:08.355
There's nothing wrong with that.

141
00:19:08.439 --> 00:19:11.358
- It's Hanna.
- You look so suspicious.

142
00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:17.614
- What's yours, kid?
- Michael.

143
00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:21.159
Michael. Hmm.

144
00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:23.495
So I'm with a Michael.

145
00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:26.832
Hanna.

146
00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:31.837
[teacher] The notion of secrecy
is central to Western literature.

147
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.508
You may say the whole idea of character

148
00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:39.845
is defined by people

149
00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.681
holding specific information,

150
00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:45.433
which, for various reasons,

151
00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:49.396
sometimes perverse,
sometimes noble,

152
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.899
they are determined not to disclose.

153
00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:03.326
[laughs]

154
00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:09.249
[Hanna] You never tell me
what you've been studying.

155
00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:11.001
Studying?

156
00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:14.462
At school.

157
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.970
- Do you learn languages?
- Yes.

158
00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:26.975
- What languages?
- Latin.

159
00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:34.900
- Say something in Latin.
- [laughing]

160
00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:37.277
[speaking Latin]

161
00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:43.074
It's Horace.

162
00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.535
It's wonderful.

163
00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:48.663
Do you want some Greek?

164
00:21:01.719 --> 00:21:05.305
[reading in Greek]

165
00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.893
It's beautiful.

166
00:21:09.977 --> 00:21:12.479
How can you tell?

167
00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:15.941
How do you know,
when you've no idea what it means?

168
00:21:19.362 --> 00:21:21.363
What are you studying in German?

169
00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:22.781
I'm studying a play.

170
00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:28.536
By a writer called Gotthold
Ephraim Lessing. You heard of him?

171
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:33.208
The play's called Emilia Galotti.
You can read it.

172
00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.877
I'd rather listen to you.

173
00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:37.712
All right.

174
00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:49.975
"Act One. Scene One.

175
00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:53.269
The setting:
one of the prince's chambers.

176
00:21:53.354 --> 00:21:55.897
The Prince..."

177
00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:58.650
I'm not very good.

178
00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:00.068
Go on.

179
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:05.907
"Complaints, nothing but complaints.

180
00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:10.954
For goodness sake,
is there anything left but work?

181
00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:14.290
Just imagine that
people actually envy us."

182
00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.336
You're good at it, aren't you?

183
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.924
Good at what?

184
00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:27.721
Reading.

185
00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:33.435
What's funny?

186
00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:37.981
I didn't think I was good at anything.

187
00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:41.568
[boys shouting]

188
00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:46.239
[whistling, clapping]

189
00:22:50.745 --> 00:22:52.454
Whoo!

190
00:22:58.127 --> 00:23:00.295
[bell clangs]

191
00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:48.218
[footsteps approaching]

192
00:24:06.028 --> 00:24:09.155
What are you doing?
What is this?

193
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.449
Why did you behave
as if you didn't know me?

194
00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:15.495
You didn't want to know me! You could
see I was in the first carriage!

195
00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:18.998
- So why did you sit in the second?
- What did you think I was doing?

196
00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:21.709
- Why did you think I was there?
- How should I know?

197
00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:25.505
Now, I've been working.
I need a bath.

198
00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:27.882
And I'd like to be by myself.

199
00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:29.551
Would you please leave?!

200
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.350
I... I didn't mean to upset you.

201
00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:42.856
You don't have the power to upset me.

202
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.066
You don't matter enough to upset me.

203
00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:52.574
[gas heater turns on,
water runs]

204
00:25:19.268 --> 00:25:21.561
[sniffling]

205
00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:04.729
I don't know what to say.

206
00:26:07.107 --> 00:26:09.317
I've never been with a woman before.

207
00:26:13.447 --> 00:26:16.324
We've been together four weeks,

208
00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:18.910
and I can't live without you.

209
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:21.371
I can't.

210
00:26:21.455 --> 00:26:23.706
Even the thought of it kills me.

211
00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:33.216
I sat in the second carriage
because I thought you might kiss me.

212
00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:37.553
Kid, you thought
we could make love in a tram?

213
00:26:43.352 --> 00:26:45.895
Is it true what you said?

214
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.772
That I don't matter to you?

215
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.246
Do you forgive me?

216
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:10.545
Do you love me?

217
00:27:28.397 --> 00:27:32.525
- Do you have a book?
- Yes, I have.

218
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:34.402
I took one with me this morning.

219
00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:39.282
- What is it?
- The Odyssey, by Homer.

220
00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:41.200
It's my homework.

221
00:27:44.038 --> 00:27:46.456
We're changing the order we do things.

222
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.376
Read to me first, kid.
Then we make love.

223
00:27:55.966 --> 00:27:59.844
- [Michael] The Odyssey, by Homer.
- What's an odyssey?

224
00:27:59.928 --> 00:28:01.763
A journey.
He sets out on a journey.

225
00:28:02.765 --> 00:28:03.765
[Hanna] Good.

226
00:28:08.145 --> 00:28:11.981
"Sing to me of the man, Muse
The man of twists and turns

227
00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:15.318
Driven time and again off course
Once he had plundered

228
00:28:15.402 --> 00:28:18.363
- The hallowed heights of Troy"
- Come here.

229
00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:28.373
[Michael] "He pressed
her hand to his lips.

230
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.043
She was dead.

231
00:28:32.127 --> 00:28:35.505
- Past all help, or need of it."
- [sobbing]

232
00:28:41.428 --> 00:28:43.096
[panting]

233
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.849
[Michael] "I poked into the place a
ways, encountered a little open patch

234
00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:50.395
as big as a bedroom,
all hung around with vines,

235
00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:52.397
and found a man lying there asleep.

236
00:28:52.481 --> 00:28:56.818
And, by jings, it was my old Jim.

237
00:28:56.902 --> 00:29:00.363
'When you landed,
I reckoned I could catch up with you

238
00:29:00.447 --> 00:29:04.242
on the land without having to shout
at you. But when I see that house,

239
00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:06.077
I begin to go slow."' [laughs]

240
00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:10.915
"Lady Chatterley
felt his naked flesh against her

241
00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:14.210
as he came into her.

242
00:29:14.294 --> 00:29:16.546
For a moment,
he was still inside her..."

243
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.631
This is disgusting.

244
00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:22.385
Where did you get this?

245
00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:25.304
- I borrowed it from someone at school.
- Oh...

246
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:27.223
You should be ashamed.

247
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:32.395
Go on.

248
00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:33.479
[blows raspberry]

249
00:29:33.564 --> 00:29:37.608
"'Billions of bilious blue blistering
barnacles in a thundering typhoon!

250
00:29:37.693 --> 00:29:41.279
It is water!' 'But what on earth
did you expect it to be?"'

251
00:29:41.363 --> 00:29:45.616
- Whiskey.
- "'Whiskey, by thunder, whiskey!'

252
00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:49.120
'Whiskey? Come now, captain,
you can't be serious."'

253
00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:52.331
That's enough for today, kid.

254
00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:56.169
I was wondering, do you think
you could get some time off?

255
00:29:56.253 --> 00:29:58.796
Maybe we could go on a trip.

256
00:29:58.881 --> 00:30:02.049
- What sort of trip?
- A cycling holiday.

257
00:30:02.134 --> 00:30:04.093
Just two days.

258
00:30:08.265 --> 00:30:11.100
I've got a guide book.
I've worked out the route.

259
00:30:11.185 --> 00:30:14.770
Look. What do you think?

260
00:30:18.233 --> 00:30:20.651
I think you like planning, don't you?

261
00:30:24.698 --> 00:30:27.200
[sighing]

262
00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:39.670
[Michael] "I'm not frightened.

263
00:30:39.755 --> 00:30:41.672
I'm not frightened of anything.

264
00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:48.429
The more I suffer, the more I love.

265
00:30:48.514 --> 00:30:51.265
Danger will only increase my love.

266
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.852
It will sharpen it.
It will give it spice.

267
00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.397
I'll be the only angel you need.

268
00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:03.277
You will leave life even more beautiful
than you entered it.

269
00:31:03.362 --> 00:31:07.031
Heaven will take you back
and look at you and say,

270
00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:12.954
'Only one thing can make a soul
complete, and that thing is love."'

271
00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:22.630
[laughing]

272
00:31:39.147 --> 00:31:41.274
- Hello.
- Hello.

273
00:31:45.153 --> 00:31:47.947
[boys laughing]

274
00:31:48.031 --> 00:31:50.157
- [woman] Excuse me.
- Hello.

275
00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:53.327
Do you know what you'd like?

276
00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:58.916
- Um...
- What are you having?

277
00:31:59.001 --> 00:32:02.878
- You order. I'll have what you have.
- OK.

278
00:32:02.963 --> 00:32:04.589
Um...

279
00:32:04.673 --> 00:32:09.594
Two frankfurters, two potato salads
and two beers, please.

282
00:32:18.854 --> 00:32:20.730
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

283
00:32:20.814 --> 00:32:24.108
- I hope your mother was happy.
- Thank you.

284
00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:26.360
She enjoyed her meal very much.

285
00:32:41.877 --> 00:32:43.377
Come on.

286
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:51.093
[laughing, shouting]

287
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:03.481
Here, let me show you
where we're going.

288
00:33:03.565 --> 00:33:06.359
It's OK, kid.

289
00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:09.028
I don't want to know.

[choir stops singing]

293
00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:03.184
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing a poem. About you.

294
00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:09.106
- Can I hear it?
- It's not ready.

295
00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:11.650
I'll read it to you one day.

296
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.513
[bicycle bells ringing]

297
00:35:54.528 --> 00:35:58.405
[choral music plays in car]

298
00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:19.385
[music continues]

299
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:23.931
[shuts off music]

300
00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:30.646
- Morning, Hendrick.
- Good morning, Mr. Berg.

301
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:33.023
- You're in court 306.
- Thank you.

302
00:36:33.108 --> 00:36:34.942
- You all right, Michael?
- I'm fine.

303
00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:38.028
- Hurry. You know what she's like.
- [Michael] See you later!

304
00:36:38.113 --> 00:36:39.780
Good luck.

305
00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:43.284
[man] Please stand.

306
00:36:47.747 --> 00:36:49.623
Please sit down.

307
00:36:53.587 --> 00:36:56.213
[woman] The defendant, please.

308
00:36:56.298 --> 00:37:01.427
- [indistinct chatter]
- [whistling]

309
00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:08.434
They're coming.

310
00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:17.401
- Hello.
- Hello.

311
00:37:17.485 --> 00:37:20.237
- What did she say?
- [teacher] Good morning, ladies.

312
00:37:20.322 --> 00:37:24.450
Welcome your new fellow-students.
Treat them with courtesy.

313
00:37:24.534 --> 00:37:27.244
- Sit down.
- Hello.

314
00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:31.916
- My name's Sophie.
- I'm Michael.

315
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.918
[teacher] The Odyssey.

316
00:37:34.002 --> 00:37:35.836
Take our your books.

317
00:37:39.049 --> 00:37:41.967
Everyone believes
Homer's subject is homecoming.

318
00:37:42.052 --> 00:37:45.054
In fact, The Odyssey
is a book about a journey.

319
00:37:45.138 --> 00:37:47.932
Home is a place you dream of.

320
00:37:48.016 --> 00:37:52.102
Berg, I don't mean to distract you, but
we're meant to study Homer, not Sophie.

321
00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:55.689
- [laughter]
- [shouting]

322
00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:03.447
- It's wonderful, isn't it?
- Wonderful.

323
00:38:03.531 --> 00:38:05.032
It's gonna be a great summer.

324
00:38:19.172 --> 00:38:22.007
- Why do you leave early?
- He always leaves early.

325
00:38:22.092 --> 00:38:25.344
- Do you have somewhere to go?
- See you tomorrow.

326
00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:35.896
[Michael] Sorry I'm late.

327
00:38:37.983 --> 00:38:39.942
I got held up at school.

328
00:38:41.945 --> 00:38:43.654
I have a new book.

329
00:38:43.738 --> 00:38:46.907
The Lady with a Little Dog.

330
00:38:49.536 --> 00:38:50.786
By Anton Chekhov.

331
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:54.164
"The talk was that a new face
had appeared on the promenade,

332
00:38:54.249 --> 00:38:56.417
a lady with a little dog."

333
00:39:09.097 --> 00:39:11.598
[man] Schmitz, one moment, please.

334
00:39:12.976 --> 00:39:17.146
I read the reports on you.
Every single one. Excellent work.

335
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.815
You'll be working in the office.

336
00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:23.277
You got promoted. Congratulations.

337
00:39:30.452 --> 00:39:34.413
- [boy] Yee-haw!
- Ah! [laughs]

338
00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:36.707
[boy] Let's get out of here!

339
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:40.085
Come on! Michael, we're leaving.
Let's go!

340
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.295
Come on, Michael!

341
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:44.423
It's meant to be a surprise
for your birthday.

342
00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:50.179
- [boy] Come on!
- [boy 2] What's the matter?

343
00:39:50.263 --> 00:39:53.390
- I'm sorry. Really.
- [Sophie] We thought you'd like it.

344
00:39:53.475 --> 00:39:55.684
[boy] We've got beer!
We're gonna dance!

345
00:39:56.644 --> 00:39:57.770
I promised someone.

346
00:39:58.897 --> 00:40:00.898
[girl] Michael, please!

347
00:40:05.987 --> 00:40:09.656
[Michael] "Here and there the reflection
of the stars and the lights,

348
00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:12.117
on the bank quivered and trembled."

349
00:40:12.202 --> 00:40:14.912
- [Hanna] Oh, kid, kid.
- What?

350
00:40:14.996 --> 00:40:17.873
- Stop.
- What's wrong now?

351
00:40:17.957 --> 00:40:20.501
Nothing's wrong.

352
00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:24.838
It's nothing.

353
00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:30.344
You know, you never ask.

354
00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:33.972
You never bother to ask how I am!

355
00:40:34.057 --> 00:40:35.724
[Hanna] You never say.

356
00:40:37.018 --> 00:40:38.852
It just happens to be my birthday.

357
00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:43.440
It's my birthday, that's all!

358
00:40:43.525 --> 00:40:45.400
You've never
even asked when it is.

359
00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:48.153
- If you want a fight, kid...
- I don't want a fight!

360
00:40:48.238 --> 00:40:51.824
- What's wrong with you?!
- What business is it of yours?!

361
00:40:51.908 --> 00:40:55.285
It's always on your terms.
Everything.

362
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:58.080
We do what you want.
It's always what you want.

363
00:40:58.164 --> 00:41:00.958
- My friends were giving me a party.
- Why are you here?

364
00:41:01.042 --> 00:41:04.711
Go back to your party.
Is that what you want?

365
00:41:07.048 --> 00:41:09.216
Mm! Mm!

366
00:41:30.363 --> 00:41:32.322
It's always me
that has to apologize.

367
00:41:32.407 --> 00:41:36.702
You don't have to apologize.
No one has to apologize.

368
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.129
War and Peace, kid.

369
00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:09.253
[panting]

370
00:43:32.527 --> 00:43:34.736
Now, you must go
back to your friends.

371
00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:43.537
[chanting]

372
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920
Are you all right?

373
00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:20.741
[indistinct chatter]

374
00:45:23.096 --> 00:45:24.429
It's him.

375
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:30.519
Good.

376
00:45:30.603 --> 00:45:32.896
Get the boy something to eat.

377
00:45:41.906 --> 00:45:45.492
[father] I think we all knew you'd
come back to us eventually.

378
00:46:54.562 --> 00:46:57.731
Mr. Berg? It is 8:00.

379
00:46:57.815 --> 00:46:59.566
Your daughter.

380
00:47:02.236 --> 00:47:04.321
Thank you.

381
00:47:04.405 --> 00:47:04.446
[indistinct chatter]

382
00:47:04.447 --> 00:47:06.907
[indistinct chatter]

383
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:08.825
Julia.

384
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:10.827
[laughing]

385
00:47:10.912 --> 00:47:13.997
- I've not kept you waiting?
- I was early.

386
00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:16.291
Welcome back. [laughs]

387
00:47:19.045 --> 00:47:22.172
So how will you decide?

388
00:47:22.256 --> 00:47:25.050
I don't know.

389
00:47:25.134 --> 00:47:27.010
I'm happy back in Berlin, I suppose.

390
00:47:27.094 --> 00:47:29.262
- You've seen your mother?
- Mm-hmm.

391
00:47:29.347 --> 00:47:31.973
I wanted to get away. That's all.

392
00:47:32.058 --> 00:47:34.476
It was Paris,
but it could have been anywhere.

393
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.020
Away from your parents?

394
00:47:38.898 --> 00:47:41.316
I'm aware I was difficult.

395
00:47:43.152 --> 00:47:44.986
I wasn't always open with you.

396
00:47:48.533 --> 00:47:50.825
I'm not open with anyone.

397
00:47:57.333 --> 00:47:58.917
I knew you were distant.

398
00:48:00.795 --> 00:48:05.715
You know...
I always assumed it was my fault.

399
00:48:06.801 --> 00:48:09.553
Julia.

400
00:48:09.637 --> 00:48:11.388
How wrong can you be?

401
00:48:11.472 --> 00:48:13.181
[sobbing]

402
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:26.027
- [Julia] I'll see you very soon.
- [Michael] See you soon.

403
00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:31.324
- [Julia] Good night, Dad.
- [Michael] Good night.

404
00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:41.710
[woman] Those of you
for the special seminar group,

405
00:48:41.794 --> 00:48:43.086
please stay on in this room.

406
00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:43.920
please stay on in this room.

407
00:48:44.005 --> 00:48:46.756
Professor Rohl will
be here in a moment.

408
00:49:17.413 --> 00:49:22.292
Well, we seem
to be quite a small group.

409
00:49:22.376 --> 00:49:26.087
A small group and a select one.

410
00:49:26.172 --> 00:49:29.466
Clearly, this is going
to be a unique seminar.

411
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:34.095
We are going to start
with a reading list, gentlemen.

412
00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.681
Karl Jaspers...

413
00:49:36.766 --> 00:49:41.061
- And ladies.
- ...The Question of German Guilt.

414
00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:45.065
[♪ Creation: Making Time]

415
00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.622
[girl] So this is where you are.

416
00:50:00.706 --> 00:50:02.248
Yes.

417
00:50:04.043 --> 00:50:05.502
Come in.

418
00:50:07.588 --> 00:50:11.341
- You take work seriously.
- I don't know.

419
00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:13.843
You're rather a serious boy.

420
00:50:13.928 --> 00:50:16.012
It's how I was brought up.

421
00:50:17.598 --> 00:50:20.684
What about you? Are you serious?

422
00:50:23.562 --> 00:50:26.022
You're sure you want to work tonight?

423
00:50:27.566 --> 00:50:28.733
Yeah.

424
00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:32.112
But I won't work every night.

425
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.823
See you tomorrow.

426
00:50:40.788 --> 00:50:43.915
- Yes. Exactly
- That's right.

427
00:50:48.713 --> 00:50:50.547
You need a hand.

428
00:50:51.382 --> 00:50:54.384
[crowd shouting]

429
00:50:58.389 --> 00:51:01.099
[siren wailing]

430
00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:15.321
[crowd chanting]

431
00:51:15.406 --> 00:51:19.576
- Why all the police?
- They're worried about demonstrators.

432
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:22.495
- For or against?
- Both.

433
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.461
[girl] Wow. It's a circus.

434
00:51:32.715 --> 00:51:34.632
[man] All rise.

435
00:51:37.219 --> 00:51:39.596
All photographers
are now asked to leave.

436
00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:43.808
This court is now in session.
Please sit down.

437
00:51:47.313 --> 00:51:49.814
[judge] First thing I'm going to do
is hear motions

438
00:51:49.899 --> 00:51:52.108
from each of the defendants' lawyers.

439
00:51:52.193 --> 00:51:55.987
They're arguing that there's
no reason to keep the defendants in jail

440
00:51:56.071 --> 00:51:58.782
until the outcome
of the forthcoming trial.

441
00:51:58.866 --> 00:52:01.493
- I'll take these cases one by one.
- Want a pen?

442
00:52:01.577 --> 00:52:04.871
- I got a pen.
- [judge] Hanna Schmitz.

443
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:10.293
- Your name is Hanna Schmitz?
- [Hanna] Yes.

444
00:52:10.377 --> 00:52:12.754
[judge] Can you speak louder please?

445
00:52:12.838 --> 00:52:15.882
- [Hanna] My name is Hanna Schmitz.
- [judge] Thank you.

446
00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:21.805
- You were born on October 21st, 1922?
- [Hanna] Yes.

447
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:23.681
[judge] At Hermannstadt.

448
00:52:23.766 --> 00:52:28.102
- And you're now 43 years old?
- [Hanna] Yes.

449
00:52:28.187 --> 00:52:33.274
- [judge] You joined the SS in 1943?
- Yes.

450
00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:35.902
[judge] What was your
reason for joining?

451
00:52:37.613 --> 00:52:40.740
You were working
at the Siemens factory at the time?

452
00:52:40.825 --> 00:52:41.908
Yes.

453
00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:44.577
[judge] You'd recently
been offered a promotion.

454
00:52:44.662 --> 00:52:46.496
Why did you prefer to join the SS?

455
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.833
- Objection.
- [judge] I'll re-phrase my question.

456
00:52:49.917 --> 00:52:52.502
I'm trying to ascertain

457
00:52:52.586 --> 00:52:55.672
if she joined the SS freely, hmm?

458
00:52:55.756 --> 00:52:57.173
Of her own free will.

459
00:52:58.759 --> 00:53:02.345
- I heard there were jobs.
- [judge] Go on.

460
00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:05.223
[Hanna] I was working at Siemens

461
00:53:05.307 --> 00:53:08.560
when I heard the SS was recruiting.

462
00:53:08.644 --> 00:53:12.522
[judge] Did you know the kind of work
you'd be expected to do?

463
00:53:12.606 --> 00:53:16.192
They were looking for guards.

464
00:53:16.277 --> 00:53:20.530
- I applied for a job.
- [judge] You worked first at Auschwitz?

465
00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:23.867
- [Hanna] Yes.
- [judge] Until 1944.

466
00:53:23.951 --> 00:53:28.538
Then you were moved to
a smaller camp near Kraków?

467
00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:30.206
- [Hanna] Yes.
- Are you OK?

468
00:53:30.291 --> 00:53:33.042
- [judge] You helped move prisoners...
- I'm fine.

469
00:53:33.127 --> 00:53:36.588
...west in the winter of 1944
in the so-called death marches?

470
00:53:57.818 --> 00:54:01.529
- So, what did you think?
- I don't know.

471
00:54:02.781 --> 00:54:04.741
It wasn't quite what I was expecting.

472
00:54:04.825 --> 00:54:09.078
Wasn't it? In what way?
What were you expecting?

473
00:54:09.163 --> 00:54:11.497
I thought it was exciting.

474
00:54:11.582 --> 00:54:14.083
[Rohl] Exciting? Why?

475
00:54:14.168 --> 00:54:16.586
Why did you think it was exciting?

476
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:18.421
Because it's justice.

477
00:54:25.137 --> 00:54:28.890
- [shouting]
- [glass breaking]

478
00:54:37.858 --> 00:54:40.818
[inaudible]

479
00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:53.164
Societies think they operate
by something called morality,

480
00:54:53.248 --> 00:54:54.749
but they don't.

481
00:54:54.833 --> 00:54:59.170
They operate by something called law.

482
00:54:59.254 --> 00:55:04.884
You're not guilty of anything
merely by working at Auschwitz.

483
00:55:04.969 --> 00:55:08.221
Eight thousand people
worked at Auschwitz.

484
00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:13.810
Precisely 19 have been convicted,
and only six for murder.

485
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:18.815
To prove murder,
you have to prove intent.

486
00:55:18.899 --> 00:55:20.733
That's the law.

487
00:55:20.818 --> 00:55:24.529
The question is never was it wrong,

488
00:55:24.613 --> 00:55:27.490
but was it legal.

489
00:55:27.574 --> 00:55:32.328
And not by our laws, no.

490
00:55:32.413 --> 00:55:36.499
- By the laws at the time.
- But isn't that...

491
00:55:36.583 --> 00:55:39.085
- [Rohl] What?
- ...narrow?

492
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:43.047
Oh, yes. The law is narrow.

493
00:55:44.049 --> 00:55:46.175
On the other hand,

494
00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.721
I suspect people who kill other people

495
00:55:49.805 --> 00:55:53.433
tend to be aware that it's wrong.

496
00:55:54.518 --> 00:55:55.268
[judge] Miss Schmitz,
you're familiar with this book?

497
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:58.938
[judge] Miss Schmitz,
you're familiar with this book?

498
00:56:01.066 --> 00:56:03.317
- Yes.
- Parts of it

499
00:56:03.402 --> 00:56:05.862
have already been
read out in court.

500
00:56:05.946 --> 00:56:08.531
It's by a survivor,

501
00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:10.533
a prisoner who survived.

502
00:56:10.617 --> 00:56:13.327
Ilana Mather.

503
00:56:13.412 --> 00:56:16.039
She was in the camp
when she was a child, wasn't she?

504
00:56:16.123 --> 00:56:18.833
- She was with her mother.
- [Hanna] Yes.

505
00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:23.212
[judge] In the book,
she describes a selection process.

506
00:56:23.297 --> 00:56:26.340
At the end of the month's labor,
every month,

507
00:56:26.425 --> 00:56:29.469
sixty inmates were selected.

508
00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:33.056
Picked out to be sent from
the satellite camp back to Auschwitz.

509
00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.058
That's right, isn't it?

510
00:56:36.435 --> 00:56:38.644
Yes, that's right.

511
00:56:38.729 --> 00:56:42.106
[judge] And, so far,
each of your fellow defendants

512
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:44.984
has specifically denied
being part of that process.

513
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:49.030
Now, I'm going to ask you.

514
00:56:49.114 --> 00:56:50.490
Were you part of it?

515
00:56:52.993 --> 00:56:54.035
Yes.

516
00:56:55.329 --> 00:56:57.538
[murmuring]

517
00:56:57.623 --> 00:57:01.209
So you helped make the selection?

518
00:57:01.293 --> 00:57:04.295
- Yes.
- [judge] You admit that?

519
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.929
Then tell me,

520
00:57:13.013 --> 00:57:15.431
how did that selection happen?

521
00:57:15.516 --> 00:57:18.184
[Hanna] There were six guards,

522
00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:22.897
so we decided we'd
choose ten people each.

523
00:57:24.483 --> 00:57:27.110
That's how we did it every month.

524
00:57:27.194 --> 00:57:29.445
We'd all choose ten.

525
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:32.240
Your fellow defendants
took part in the process?

526
00:57:32.324 --> 00:57:35.076
We all did.

527
00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.787
[judge] Even though they've denied it?

528
00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:41.624
Saying "we," "we all"
is easier than saying "I," "I alone,"

529
00:57:41.708 --> 00:57:43.376
isn't it, Miss Schmitz?

530
00:57:45.045 --> 00:57:48.047
Did you not realize

531
00:57:48.132 --> 00:57:50.967
that you were sending
these women to their deaths?

532
00:57:51.051 --> 00:57:54.679
But they were new arrivals,
new women were arriving all the time.

533
00:57:54.763 --> 00:57:59.475
So... the old ones had to make room
for the new ones.

534
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:00.643
[gasping]

535
00:58:00.727 --> 00:58:04.230
- I'm not sure you understand...
- We couldn't keep everyone.

536
00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:06.732
- There wasn't room.
- [judge] No.

537
00:58:06.817 --> 00:58:09.735
But what I'm saying...

538
00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.572
Let me rephrase.

539
00:58:12.656 --> 00:58:15.491
To make room, you were
picking women out and saying,

540
00:58:15.576 --> 00:58:20.163
"You, you and you have
to be sent back to be killed."

541
00:58:20.247 --> 00:58:22.707
Well, what would you have done?

542
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.720
Should I never
have signed up at Siemens?

543
00:58:48.192 --> 00:58:51.777
[man] Ms. Mather,
they're ready for you now.

544
00:58:54.198 --> 00:58:56.782
Go, go. Go, go, go.

545
00:59:08.253 --> 00:59:10.963
- Where's Michael?
- I don't know.

546
00:59:12.299 --> 00:59:16.886
[judge] In your book, you describe
the process of selection.

547
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:18.554
[Ilana] Yes.

548
00:59:18.639 --> 00:59:22.558
You were made to work and then,
when you were no longer any use to them,

549
00:59:22.643 --> 00:59:26.062
then they sent you back
to Auschwitz to be killed.

550
00:59:26.146 --> 00:59:29.023
[judge] Are there people here
who made that selection?

551
00:59:29.107 --> 00:59:30.942
[Ilana] Yes.

552
00:59:31.026 --> 00:59:36.489
[judge] I need you to identify them.
Can you please point them out?

553
00:59:49.169 --> 00:59:50.878
Her.

554
00:59:54.383 --> 00:59:55.758
And her.

555
00:59:58.303 --> 00:59:59.762
Her.

556
01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.141
And her.

557
01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.062
Her.

558
01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:11.857
And her.

559
01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:16.362
[judge] Thank you. Please continue.

560
01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:19.991
Each of the guards would choose
a certain number of women.

561
01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:22.243
Hanna Schmitz chose differently.

562
01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:24.870
[judge] In what way differently?

563
01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.711
She had favorites.

564
01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:35.089
Girls, mostly young.

565
01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:37.967
We all remarked on it.

566
01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:41.262
She gave them food
and places to sleep.

567
01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:45.933
In the evening,
she... she asked them to join her.

568
01:00:46.018 --> 01:00:47.601
And we all thought...

569
01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:50.688
Well, you can imagine
what we thought.

570
01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:56.402
And then we found out she was making
these women read aloud to her.

571
01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.240
They were reading to her.

572
01:01:02.451 --> 01:01:06.996
At first, we thought this guard,
this guard is...

573
01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:11.876
...more sensitive,
she's more human, she's kinder.

574
01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:16.172
Often, she chose the weak, the sick.

575
01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:21.218
She picked them out.
She seemed to be protecting them almost.

576
01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:23.888
But then she dispatched them.

577
01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.934
Is that kinder?

578
01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:40.905
[judge] I want to
move on now to the march.

579
01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:45.034
As I understand it, you and your
daughter were marched for many months.

580
01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:49.288
[Mrs. Mather] In the winter of 1944,
our camp was closed down.

581
01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:54.377
We were told we had to move on.
But the plan kept changing every day.

582
01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:58.214
Women were dying
all around us in the snow.

583
01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:02.885
Half of us died on the march.
My daughter says in the book,

584
01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:06.263
"Less a death march,
more a death gallop."

585
01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:12.019
[judge] Please tell us about
the night in the church.

586
01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:24.490
That night, we thought we were lucky
because we had a roof over our heads.

587
01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.410
[judge] Go on.

588
01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:30.579
We'd arrived in a village.

589
01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:35.126
As always, the guards took the best
quarters. They took the priest's house.

590
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:38.671
But they let us sleep in a church.

591
01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:42.258
There was a bombing raid
in the middle of the night.

592
01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:44.510
The church was hit.

593
01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:49.890
At first, we could only hear the fire.
It was in the steeple.

594
01:02:51.852 --> 01:02:54.728
Then we could see burning beams...

595
01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:58.899
...and they began to crash to the floor.

596
01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:03.696
Everyone rushed...

597
01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:08.075
...rushed to the doors.

598
01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:13.956
But the doors had been
locked on the outside.

599
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.377
[judge] The church burned down?
Nobody came to open the doors?

600
01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:21.380
Is that right?

601
01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.424
[Mrs. Mather] Nobody.

602
01:03:23.508 --> 01:03:26.719
[judge] Even though you
were all burning to death?

603
01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:31.932
How many people were killed?

604
01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:35.060
Everyone was killed.

605
01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:39.440
[judge] But you survived?

606
01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:49.033
Thank you.

607
01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:54.830
I want to thank you
for coming to this country

608
01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:57.082
today to testify.

609
01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:05.508
I don't know. I don't know
what we're doing here anymore.

610
01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:07.927
Don't you?

611
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:09.929
You tell us to think like lawyers,

612
01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:14.058
but there's something...
disgusting about this.

613
01:04:14.142 --> 01:04:16.519
- How so?
- This didn't happen to the Germans.

614
01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:18.771
It happened to the Jews.

615
01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:22.942
- What are we trying to do?
- We're trying to understand.

616
01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:26.028
Six women locked 300 Jews in a church
and let them burn.

617
01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:28.322
What is there to understand?

618
01:04:30.951 --> 01:04:34.453
Tell me! I'm asking!
What is there to understand?

619
01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:40.876
I started out believing in this trial.
I thought it was great.

620
01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:44.296
Now, I think it's...
it's just a diversion.

621
01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:47.216
Yes? Diversion from what?

622
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.302
You choose six women,
you put them on trial,

623
01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:53.639
you say, "They were the evil ones,
they were the guilty ones."

624
01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.225
One of the victims
happened to write a book.

625
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:59.395
That's why they're on trial
and nobody else!

626
01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:02.731
Do you know how many camps
there were in Europe?

627
01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:05.234
People go on about
how much did everyone know?

628
01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:09.196
Who knew? What did they know?
Everyone knew!

629
01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:13.909
Our parents, our teachers.
That isn't the question!

630
01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:16.078
The question is,
"How'd you let this happen?"

631
01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:19.290
Better, "Why didn't you
kill yourself when you found out?"

632
01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:25.462
Thousands. That's how many.
There were thousands of camps.

633
01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:27.464
Everyone knew.

634
01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:37.349
Look at that woman.

635
01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:42.855
- Which woman?
- The woman you're always staring at.

636
01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.398
I'm sorry, but you are.

637
01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.326
I don't know which woman you mean.

638
01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:58.662
You know what I'd do?

639
01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:04.793
Put the gun in my hand,
I'd shoot her myself.

640
01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:10.007
Shoot them all!

641
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.893
[judge] Why did you
not unlock the doors?

642
01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:10.103
Why did you not unlock the doors?

643
01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:12.731
Why did you not unlock the doors?

644
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:18.946
I've asked all of you,
and I'm getting no answer.

645
01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:23.492
Two of the victims are in this court.
They deserve an answer.

646
01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.290
This is the SS report.
You all have copies.

647
01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:35.337
The report which was written,
approved and signed by all of you

648
01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:38.966
immediately after the event.
In the written report,

649
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:43.762
you all claim you didn't even know
about the fire until after it happened.

650
01:09:43.847 --> 01:09:46.139
But that isn't true, is it?

651
01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:48.934
Well?

652
01:09:50.436 --> 01:09:51.603
It's not true.

653
01:09:55.984 --> 01:09:59.736
- I don't know what you're asking.
- The first thing I'm asking

654
01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:03.615
- is why didn't you unlock the doors?
- Obviously.

655
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.701
For the obvious reason.

656
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.996
- We couldn't.
- Why couldn't you?

657
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.915
We were guards.

658
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.502
Our job was to guard the prisoners.

659
01:10:15.587 --> 01:10:17.880
We couldn't just let them escape.

660
01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:21.216
I see. And if they escaped,
then you'd be blamed,

661
01:10:21.301 --> 01:10:23.719
you'd be charged,
you might even be executed?

662
01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:25.888
- [Hanna] No!
- Well, then?

663
01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:29.224
If we'd opened the doors,
there would have been chaos.

664
01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:32.060
How could we have restored order?

665
01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:35.272
It happened so fast.
It was snowing. The bombs.

666
01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:38.525
The flames... There were flames
all over the village.

667
01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:41.737
Then the screaming began,
and got worse and worse.

668
01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:45.240
If they'd all come rushing out,
we couldn't just let them escape.

669
01:10:45.325 --> 01:10:49.494
We couldn't.
We were responsible for them!

670
01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:56.752
So you did know what was happening?
You did know? You made a choice.

671
01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:59.546
You let them die,

672
01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:02.299
rather than risk letting them escape.

673
01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:08.597
The other defendants have made
an allegation against you.

674
01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:10.432
Have you heard this allegation?

675
01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:14.770
They say you were in charge.

676
01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:17.856
It isn't true.
I was... I was just one of the guards.

677
01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.400
- She was in charge.
- [woman] She was!

678
01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:22.945
- Of course she was.
- Did you write the report?

679
01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:27.824
No. No. We all discussed what to say.
We all wrote it together.

680
01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:30.160
She wrote the report.
She was in charge.

681
01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:31.620
- [judge] Is that true?
- No.

682
01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:33.455
- Yes, you did!
- Does it matter?

683
01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.666
- She wrote it.
- [judge] I need a sample

684
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:39.878
- of your handwriting.
- My...

685
01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:42.297
- My handwriting?
- Yes. I need to establish

686
01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:45.550
- who wrote the report.
- I don't see how that's appropriate.

687
01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:48.804
- 20 years have gone by.
- Take her paper. Approach the bench.

688
01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:52.391
- Compare handwriting of 20 years...?
- [judge] Approach the bench.

689
01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:59.898
[judge] I will not be overruled
in my own court.

690
01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:02.192
[counsel] I'm sorry...

691
01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:11.535
I'd rather listen to you.

692
01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:33.432
There's no need.

693
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:39.187
I wrote the report.

694
01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:42.232
[murmuring]

695
01:12:53.161 --> 01:12:55.537
[judge] Silence, please.

696
01:12:56.831 --> 01:12:57.956
Order!

697
01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:13.180
You've been skipping seminars.

698
01:13:36.496 --> 01:13:39.164
I have a piece of information.

699
01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:42.125
Concerning one of the defendants.

700
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.212
- Something they're not admitting.
- What information?

701
01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:56.014
You don't need me to tell you.

702
01:13:56.099 --> 01:14:01.186
It's perfectly clear. You have a moral
obligation to disclose it to the court.

703
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:05.023
It happens this information
is favorable to the defendant.

704
01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:07.442
It can help her case.

705
01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:11.279
It may even affect the outcome,
certainly the sentencing.

706
01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:15.784
- So?
- There's a problem.

707
01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:19.871
The defendant herself is determined
to keep this information secret.

708
01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.415
[laughing]

709
01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:25.794
- [Rohl] A moment, please.
- Sorry.

710
01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:36.388
What are her reasons?

711
01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:40.934
Because she's ashamed.

712
01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:44.396
Ashamed of what?

713
01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:53.530
- Have you spoken to her?
- Of course not.

714
01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:56.992
Why "of course not?"

715
01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:58.577
I can't.

716
01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:02.831
I can't do that.

717
01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:04.791
I can't talk to her.

718
01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:09.838
What we feel isn't important.
It's utterly unimportant.

719
01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:12.299
The only question is what we do.

720
01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:18.972
If people like you don't learn
from what happened to people like me,

721
01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:22.350
then what the hell
is the point of anything?

722
01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:33.028
Schmitz?

723
01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:35.322
You have a visitor.

724
01:15:36.616 --> 01:15:39.701
[children shouting]

725
01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:42.078
[laughing]

726
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:50.503
[guard] Quiet, please!

727
01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:53.715
Gertrud Ballow.

728
01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:58.178
Andreas Michael Springer.

729
01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:03.141
Michael Berg.

730
01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.980
Walter Sherman.

731
01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:44.993
[guard] Time's up.

732
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.181
[girl] Are you coming in?

733
01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:18.234
[girl] You took your time.

734
01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:34.167
[panting]

735
01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:41.800
What is it?

736
01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:06.950
Where are you going?

737
01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:09.577
I'm sorry.

738
01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:11.538
I need to sleep by myself.

739
01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:52.078
[door unlocks]

740
01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:59.210
I'll just be a minute.

741
01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:06.926
[siren wailing]

742
01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:17.020
[crowd chanting]

743
01:20:28.866 --> 01:20:30.783
- Nazi!
- Nazi whore!

744
01:20:30.868 --> 01:20:33.703
- [shouting]
- Nazi!

745
01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:46.674
[man] Silence in the court.
Silence in the court.

746
01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.760
All rise.

747
01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.019
[judge] The court
finds guilty the defendants

748
01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:00.772
Rita Beckhart, Caroline Steinhoff,

749
01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:03.316
Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva

750
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.652
and Andrea Lumen

751
01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:10.657
of jointly aiding and abetting murder
in 300 cases.

752
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:13.576
The court finds guilty the defendant

753
01:21:13.661 --> 01:21:18.331
Hanna Schmitz of murder in 300 cases.

754
01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:22.544
[murmuring]

755
01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:25.713
The court sentences
the accused as follows:

756
01:21:25.798 --> 01:21:28.883
Rita Beckhart, Caroline Steinhoff,

757
01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:33.721
Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva
and Andrea Lumen

758
01:21:33.806 --> 01:21:39.143
to each serve a total sentence in prison
of four years and three months.

759
01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:41.521
Hanna Schmitz,

760
01:21:41.605 --> 01:21:45.316
in view of your own admissions
and your special role,

761
01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:48.403
you're in a different category.

762
01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:53.700
The court sentences the accused,
Schmitz, to imprisonment for life.

763
01:21:53.784 --> 01:21:55.410
[murmuring]

764
01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:28.484
Where are we going?

765
01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:31.487
I said I'll tell you when we get there.

766
01:22:31.572 --> 01:22:36.200
- You told me you liked surprises.
- I like surprises.

767
01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:56.179
[Michael] She's grown, hasn't she?

768
01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:01.726
I don't know. It's so long since
I saw her, Michael. How can I tell?

769
01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:08.274
It's my fault.
We shouldn't have come unannounced.

770
01:23:08.359 --> 01:23:11.527
[Julia] Daddy's going to live
in his own house.

771
01:23:14.698 --> 01:23:17.909
Mother, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

772
01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:20.995
Julia knows.
We've already told her.

773
01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.247
Gertrud and I,
we are getting a divorce.

774
01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:27.377
You don't come for your father's
funeral, but you come for this?

775
01:23:29.797 --> 01:23:31.839
It's not easy
for me to visit this town.

776
01:23:31.924 --> 01:23:35.051
- Were you really so unhappy?
- That's not what I'm saying.

777
01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:37.595
- It's not what I meant.
- Well, then?

778
01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:44.310
You mustn't worry about Gertrud.
I'm going to look after her.

779
01:23:44.395 --> 01:23:48.690
She's already a state prosecutor,
so she earns far more than I do.

780
01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:50.400
[mother] Michael...

781
01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:55.029
...I'm not worried about Gertrud.

782
01:23:55.114 --> 01:23:56.739
I'm worried about you.

783
01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:45.663
"Sing to me of the Man, Muse

01:24:45.748 --> 01:24:50.710

Open it.

One, two, three. Testing, testing.

[static on tape]

795
01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:33.688
[Michael on tape] The Odyssey by Homer.

796
01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.954
The Odyssey by Homer.

"...to the house of death.
But they held fast in place,

802

hoping that others might still come.

803
01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:13.269
Shades of famous heroes,
men who died in the old days

804
01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:16.939
and ghosts of an even older age,
I long to see."

"Come, sheathe your sword,
let's go to bed together.

Mount my bed and mix
in the magic work of love.

807
01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:27.241
We'll breed deep trust between us."

808
01:27:29.328 --> 01:27:33.748
"Not for all the world, not until
you consent to swear, goddess,

809
01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:38.920
a blinding oath you'll never
plot some new intrigue to harm me."

810
01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:42.757
"Straightaway, she began
to swear the oath that I required.

811
01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:44.926
Never, she would never do me harm.

812
01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:47.428
And when she'd finished then, at last,

813
01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:51.098
I mounted Circes' gorgeous bed."

814
01:27:52.351 --> 01:27:56.187
"When young Dawn, with her
rose-red fingers shone once more,

815

they yoked their pair again,

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:00.733
and out through the gates
and echoing colonnade,

817
01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:03.986
they whipped the team
to a run and on they flew,

818
01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:08.616
holding nothing back, and the princes
reached the wheatlands..."

"Perfectly astonishing.
I've always said it was all tricks,

825
01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:29.136

sleep under my very eyes."

"He lifted a large newspaper
from the table

"Zhivago... even a cake,

At one time you only had to say
to your sleigh driver in Moscow,

'Zhivago's.' And,
rather as if you had said..."

"The talk was that a new face
had appeared on the promenade,

01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:10.845
Dmitri Dmitritch Gurov
had already spent two weeks in Yalta,

so he was bored with it
and always looking for fresh faces."

Sitting in the pavilion at Vernet,

840

he saw a young woman
walking on the seafront.

A fair-haired young lady
of medium height, wearing a beret..."

[voice trails off]

843
01:29:34.745 --> 01:29:36.370
I want to take out a book.

844
01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:39.415
Which book?

845
01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:51.594
Do you have
The Lady with the Little Dog?

846
01:29:52.888 --> 01:29:54.638
What's your name?

847
01:29:57.768 --> 01:29:59.185
Hanna Schmitz.

[Michael on tape]
The Lady with the Little Dog.

- No letter?
- No letter. Sign.

860
01:33:55.797 --> 01:33:59.800
- [woman on phone] You're Michael Berg?
- Yes.

861
01:33:59.884 --> 01:34:04.430
Thank you for calling me.
You got my letter?

862
01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:06.056
I have it here.

863
01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:10.060
As I say, Hanna Schmitz
is coming up for release very soon.

864
01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:14.189
Hanna has been in prison
for over 20 years.

865
01:34:14.274 --> 01:34:15.316
She has no family.

866
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:18.277
She has no friends.

867
01:34:18.361 --> 01:34:20.821
You're her only contact.

868
01:34:20.905 --> 01:34:24.158
And I'm told you don't visit her.

869
01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:25.951
No, I don't.

870
01:34:26.036 --> 01:34:28.370
When she gets out,
she's going to need a job.

871
01:34:28.455 --> 01:34:30.831
She's going to need somewhere to live.

872
01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:35.210
You can't imagine how frightening
the modern world will seem to her.

873
01:34:38.631 --> 01:34:39.715
Mm-hmm.

874
01:34:43.428 --> 01:34:45.012
I have no one else to ask.

875
01:34:46.389 --> 01:34:49.266
If you don't take
responsibility for her,

876
01:34:49.351 --> 01:34:51.977
then Hanna has no future at all.

877
01:34:55.398 --> 01:34:57.566
It's kind of you.

878
01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:59.943
Thank you for letting me know.

879
01:35:43.822 --> 01:35:45.489
- You're Michael Berg?
- Yes.

880
01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:47.533
I'm Louisa Brenner. Good morning.

881
01:35:47.617 --> 01:35:51.036
- How do you do?
- We were expecting you earlier.

882
01:35:51.121 --> 01:35:55.207
I should warn you, for a long time
Hanna held herself together.

883
01:35:55.291 --> 01:35:59.294
She was very purposeful. In the
last few years, she's different.

884
01:35:59.379 --> 01:36:01.588
She's let herself go.

885
01:36:04.634 --> 01:36:07.678
I'm taking you straight to the canteen.

886
01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:11.181
They've just finished their lunch.

887
01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:25.195
[Brenner] Table four.

888
01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:13.035
You've grown up, kid.

889
01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:29.384
I've got a friend who's a tailor.

890
01:37:32.555 --> 01:37:33.931
He'll give you a job.

891
01:37:35.934 --> 01:37:39.269
And I've found you somewhere to live.
It's a nice place.

892
01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:40.938
Quite small, but it's nice.

893
01:37:42.524 --> 01:37:44.942
- You'll like it.
- Thank you.

894
01:37:46.778 --> 01:37:51.823
There are various social programs,
cultural stuff I can sign you up for.

895
01:37:51.908 --> 01:37:54.618
And the public library is very close.

896
01:38:01.084 --> 01:38:02.376
You read a lot?

897
01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:07.965
I prefer being read to.

898
01:38:12.595 --> 01:38:14.471
That's over now, isn't it?

899
01:38:24.148 --> 01:38:26.233
Did you get married?

900
01:38:26.317 --> 01:38:29.403
I did. Yes, I did.

901
01:38:29.487 --> 01:38:31.572
We have a daughter.

902
01:38:31.656 --> 01:38:35.075
I'm not seeing as much of her
as I'd like.

903
01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:37.661
I'd like to see
a great deal more of her.

904
01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:41.999
The marriage didn't last.

905
01:38:57.432 --> 01:38:59.891
Have you spent time
thinking about the past?

906
01:38:59.976 --> 01:39:03.770
- You mean with you?
- No.

907
01:39:03.855 --> 01:39:07.566
No, I didn't mean with me.

908
01:39:17.035 --> 01:39:20.787
Before the trial,
I never thought about the past.

909
01:39:20.872 --> 01:39:23.040
I never had to.

910
01:39:23.124 --> 01:39:25.375
Now?

911
01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:28.086
What do you feel now?

912
01:39:29.839 --> 01:39:32.174
It doesn't matter what I feel.

913
01:39:33.176 --> 01:39:35.302
It doesn't matter what I think.

914
01:39:37.388 --> 01:39:39.222
The dead are still dead.

915
01:39:46.731 --> 01:39:48.649
I wasn't sure what you'd learned.

916
01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:52.569
Well, I have learned, kid.

917
01:39:52.654 --> 01:39:55.072
I've learned to read.

918
01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.545
I'll pick you up next week, OK?

919
01:40:19.931 --> 01:40:21.890
That sounds a good plan.

920
01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.188
We can do it quietly,
or we can make a fuss.

921
01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:30.148
Quietly.

922
01:40:32.151 --> 01:40:34.403
OK. Quietly.

923
01:40:37.115 --> 01:40:38.990
Quietly.

924
01:40:47.625 --> 01:40:51.628
- Take care, kid.
- You, too. See you next week.

925
01:43:00.091 --> 01:43:02.008
[buzzing]

926
01:43:04.345 --> 01:43:06.847
I've come to collect Hanna Schmitz.

927
01:43:10.768 --> 01:43:14.020
Please. Please, take a seat.

928
01:43:39.297 --> 01:43:41.923
[Brenner] She didn't pack.

929
01:43:42.008 --> 01:43:44.301
She never intended to leave.

930
01:43:50.057 --> 01:43:53.518
[Michael] "The talk was that a new face

931
01:43:53.603 --> 01:43:57.188
had appeared on the promenade,

932
01:43:57.273 --> 01:43:59.983
a lady with a little dog."

933
01:44:06.991 --> 01:44:08.700
[Brenner] She left me a message.

934
01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.495
A sort of will.

935
01:44:14.582 --> 01:44:17.500
I'll read the bit that concerns you.

936
01:44:25.301 --> 01:44:28.261
"There is money in the old tea tin.

937
01:44:28.346 --> 01:44:31.097
Give it to Michael Berg.

938
01:44:31.182 --> 01:44:35.852
He should send it,
alongside the 7,000 Marks in the bank,

939
01:44:35.937 --> 01:44:39.731
to the daughter who survived the fire.

940
01:44:39.815 --> 01:44:41.942
It's for her.

941
01:44:42.026 --> 01:44:45.070
She should decide what to do with it.

942
01:44:48.574 --> 01:44:51.409
And tell Michael I said hello."

943
01:44:58.542 --> 01:45:03.004
[sobbing]

944
01:45:33.911 --> 01:45:37.288
[horns honking]

945
01:46:09.697 --> 01:46:12.073
- Ms. Mather?
- Yes.

946
01:46:12.783 --> 01:46:14.868
- You're Michael Berg.
- Yes.

947
01:46:14.952 --> 01:46:16.870
I was expecting you.

948
01:46:18.247 --> 01:46:21.916
- Please.
- Thank you.

949
01:46:22.001 --> 01:46:26.463
So you must tell me, exactly what
brings you to the United States?

950
01:46:26.547 --> 01:46:29.632
I was here already.
I was at a conference in Boston.

951
01:46:29.717 --> 01:46:31.009
- You're a lawyer?
- Yes.

952
01:46:31.093 --> 01:46:36.139
I was intrigued by your letter,
but I can't say I wholly understood it.

953
01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:40.226
- You attended the trial?
- Yes. Almost 20 years ago.

954
01:46:40.311 --> 01:46:46.149
I was a law student. I remember you.
I remember your mother very clearly.

955
01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:50.070
My mother died in Israel
a good many years ago.

956
01:46:50.154 --> 01:46:53.573
I... I'm sorry.

957
01:46:53.657 --> 01:46:55.575
Go on, please.

958
01:46:57.453 --> 01:46:59.329
Perhaps you heard.

959
01:46:59.413 --> 01:47:04.209
Hanna Schmitz recently died.
She killed herself.

960
01:47:05.544 --> 01:47:07.003
She was a friend of yours?

961
01:47:08.506 --> 01:47:09.964
A kind of friend.

962
01:47:11.509 --> 01:47:13.510
It's as simple as this.

963
01:47:13.594 --> 01:47:17.931
Hanna was illiterate
for the greater part of her life.

964
01:47:18.015 --> 01:47:21.184
Is that an explanation
of her behavior?

965
01:47:22.895 --> 01:47:25.146
- No.
- Or an excuse?

966
01:47:25.231 --> 01:47:27.357
No. No.

967
01:47:30.402 --> 01:47:34.114
She taught herself to read
when she was in prison.

968
01:47:34.198 --> 01:47:36.866
I sent her tapes.

969
01:47:39.495 --> 01:47:43.373
She had always liked...
being read to.

970
01:47:50.214 --> 01:47:52.966
Why don't you start
by being honest with me?

971
01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:56.094
At least start that way.

972
01:47:56.178 --> 01:47:58.805
What was the nature
of your friendship?

973
01:48:03.727 --> 01:48:06.563
When I was young,
I had an affair with Hanna.

974
01:48:12.486 --> 01:48:14.362
I'm not sure I can help you, Mr. Berg.

975
01:48:14.446 --> 01:48:16.614
And...

976
01:48:16.699 --> 01:48:18.825
...even if I could,
I'm not willing to.

977
01:48:18.909 --> 01:48:21.536
I was almost 16
when I took up with her.

978
01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:24.873
The affair only lasted a summer.
But...

979
01:48:26.417 --> 01:48:28.585
But what?

980
01:48:34.425 --> 01:48:36.134
I see.

981
01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:43.099
And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge
the effect she'd had on your life?

982
01:48:44.852 --> 01:48:48.188
She'd done much worse
to other people.

983
01:48:53.152 --> 01:48:54.861
I've never told anyone.

984
01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.493
People ask all the time
what I learned in the camps.

985
01:49:02.578 --> 01:49:05.288
But the camps weren't therapy.

986
01:49:07.416 --> 01:49:10.126
What do you think these places were,
universities?

987
01:49:11.795 --> 01:49:14.380
We didn't go there to learn.

988
01:49:14.465 --> 01:49:18.509
One becomes very clear
about these things.

989
01:49:21.972 --> 01:49:24.641
What are you asking for?
Forgiveness for her?

990
01:49:24.725 --> 01:49:27.477
Or do you just want
to feel better yourself?

991
01:49:27.561 --> 01:49:31.397
My advice? Go to the theater
if you want catharsis. Please.

992
01:49:31.482 --> 01:49:33.358
Go to literature.

993
01:49:33.442 --> 01:49:36.653
Don't go to the camps.

994
01:49:38.197 --> 01:49:40.657
Nothing comes out of the camps.

995
01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.203
Nothing.

996
01:49:58.509 --> 01:50:00.343
What she wanted...

997
01:50:01.262 --> 01:50:05.682
What she wanted was
to leave you her money.

998
01:50:05.766 --> 01:50:08.601
- I have it with me.
- To do what?

999
01:50:10.688 --> 01:50:12.438
As you think fit.

1000
01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:25.034
Here.

1001
01:50:33.585 --> 01:50:38.381
When I was a little girl,
I had a tea tin for my treasures.

1002
01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:42.760
Not quite like this.
It had Cyrillic lettering.

1003
01:50:45.639 --> 01:50:48.891
I took it with me to the camp,
but it got stolen.

1004
01:50:48.976 --> 01:50:52.478
- What was in it?
- Sentimental things.

1005
01:50:52.563 --> 01:50:56.649
A piece of hair from our dog.
Some tickets to the operas

1006
01:50:56.734 --> 01:51:00.653
my father had taken me to.
It wasn't stolen for its contents.

1007
01:51:00.738 --> 01:51:04.615
It was the tin itself

1008
01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:07.327
that was valuable,

1009
01:51:07.411 --> 01:51:09.078
what you could do with it.

1010
01:51:17.254 --> 01:51:20.173
There's nothing
I can do with this money.

1011
01:51:20.257 --> 01:51:23.676
I give it to anything associated
with extermination of Jews,

1012
01:51:23.761 --> 01:51:26.346
then to me it seems...

1013
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:29.766
...like absolution, and that's
something I'm neither willing

1014
01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:33.561
- nor in a position to grant.
- I was thinking maybe

1015
01:51:33.645 --> 01:51:37.523
an organization to encourage literacy.

1016
01:51:41.362 --> 01:51:43.863
Good. Good.

1017
01:51:43.947 --> 01:51:46.824
Do you know if there
is a Jewish organization?

1018
01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:48.659
I'd be surprised if there isn't.

1019
01:51:48.744 --> 01:51:52.372
There's a Jewish organization
for everything.

1020
01:51:52.456 --> 01:51:55.541
Not that illiteracy
is a very Jewish problem.

1021
01:51:57.378 --> 01:52:00.630
Why don't you find out?
Send them the money.

1022
01:52:16.855 --> 01:52:18.815
Shall I do it in Hanna's name?

1023
01:52:20.818 --> 01:52:22.318
As you think fit.

1024
01:52:27.616 --> 01:52:29.409
I'll keep the tin.

1025
01:52:34.331 --> 01:52:35.998
Thank you.

1026
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:27.800
[choral music plays]

1027
01:53:27.885 --> 01:53:32.638
- Where are we going?
- I thought you liked surprises.

1028
01:53:32.723 --> 01:53:35.850
I do. I do like surprises.

1029
01:54:40.123 --> 01:54:42.917
[Julia] Hanna Schmitz.

1030
01:54:47.256 --> 01:54:48.339
Who was she?

1031
01:54:50.884 --> 01:54:53.302
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1032
01:54:55.472 --> 01:54:57.598
That's why we're here.

1033
01:55:05.774 --> 01:55:07.358
So tell me.

1034
01:55:19.079 --> 01:55:21.497
[Michael] I was 15.

1035
01:55:24.084 --> 01:55:26.627
I was coming home from school.

1036
01:55:28.672 --> 01:55:30.506
I was feeling ill.

1037
01:55:31.842 --> 01:55:34.842
And a woman helped me.
