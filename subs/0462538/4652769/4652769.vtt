1
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.691
We come in peace
for cats and mice everywhere.

2
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.010
Hey, how you doing? Good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

3
00:01:23.768 --> 00:01:26.804
<i>Itchy... Itchy...</i>

4
00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:08.179
Boring!

5
00:02:08.393 --> 00:02:10.469
Dad, we can't see the movie.

6
00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:14.637
I can't believe we're paying to see
something we get on TV for free.

7
00:02:14.858 --> 00:02:18.606
If you ask me, everybody in this theater
is a giant sucker.

8
00:02:18.903 --> 00:02:20.608
Especially you.

9
00:02:20.644 --> 00:02:22.314
Especially you.

10
00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:27.818
<i>Movie on the big screen!</i>

11
00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:03.441
Excuse me. My heinie is dipping.

12
00:03:19.127 --> 00:03:21.166
All right, well,
thanks a lot for coming.

13
00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.786
We've been playing
for three and a half hours.

14
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:28.335
Now we'd like just a minute of your time
to say something about the environment.

15
00:03:32.056 --> 00:03:34.344
- You suck!
- Shut up and play!

16
00:03:34.558 --> 00:03:37.013
- Preachy!
- We're not being preachy.

17
00:03:37.227 --> 00:03:41.438
But the pollution in your lake,
it's dissolving our barge.

18
00:03:43.817 --> 00:03:45.726
I thought they touched on
a vital issue.

19
00:03:45.944 --> 00:03:47.901
I beg to differ.

20
00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:56.157
Gentlemen, it's been an honor
playing with you tonight.

21
00:04:17.932 --> 00:04:21.052
For the latest rock band
to die in our town...

22
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.308
...Lord, hear our prayer.

23
00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.137
Lord, hear our prayer.

24
00:04:26.857 --> 00:04:28.316
I hate being late.

25
00:04:28.526 --> 00:04:29.640
Well, I hate going.

26
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.900
Why can't I worship the Lord
in my own way...

27
00:04:32.112 --> 00:04:33.904
...by praying like hell on my deathbed?

28
00:04:34.114 --> 00:04:35.822
Homer, they can hear you inside.

29
00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:41.371
Relax. Those pious morons are too busy
talking to their phony-baloney God.

30
00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:47.328
How you doing? Peace be with you.
Praise Jebus.

31
00:04:58.637 --> 00:05:01.093
Today I'd like to try something
a little different.

32
00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:03.548
I'm going to call on one of you!

33
00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:07.676
Now, the word of God
dwells within everyone.

34
00:05:07.896 --> 00:05:12.308
I want you to let that word out.
Let your spirit...

35
00:05:12.817 --> 00:05:13.932
What is it, Ned?

36
00:05:14.152 --> 00:05:16.607
The good Lord is telling me
to confess to something.

37
00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:18.814
Gay, gay, gay.

38
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:22.151
An immodest sense of pride
in our community.

39
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.191
Somebody else?

40
00:05:24.662 --> 00:05:28.611
Let the Lord's light shine upon you.

41
00:05:32.503 --> 00:05:34.910
Feel the spirit.

42
00:05:35.672 --> 00:05:37.297
Let it out!

43
00:05:37.507 --> 00:05:40.793
Horrible, horrible things
are going to happen!

44
00:05:41.678 --> 00:05:45.378
And they're gonna happen to you!
And you! And you! And you.

45
00:05:45.598 --> 00:05:47.009
Whoa, nelly!

46
00:05:51.562 --> 00:05:54.563
People of Springfield,
heed this warning:

47
00:05:54.774 --> 00:05:55.972
Twisted tail!

48
00:05:56.192 --> 00:05:57.436
A thousand eyes!

49
00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:59.893
Trapped forever!

50
00:06:04.032 --> 00:06:05.028
Dad, do something!

51
00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:08.076
This book doesn't have any answers!

52
00:06:08.286 --> 00:06:10.777
Beware! Beware! Time is short!

53
00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:17.914
Believe me! Believe me!

54
00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:26.925
Thanks for listening.

55
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.343
Okay, who wants waffles?

56
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.675
I do, I do, I do!

57
00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:36.389
Wait a minute. What about Grampa?

58
00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:38.182
- I want syrup!
- I want strawberries!

59
00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.058
Something happened to that man.

60
00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:44.936
I'll tell you what happened to him.
A certain someone had a senior moment.

61
00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:50.990
But that's okay, because we love him
and we got a free rug out of it.

62
00:06:51.243 --> 00:06:53.651
What is the point of going to church
every Sunday...

63
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:58.118
...when if someone we love has a genuine
religious experience, we ignore it?

64
00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:00.125
Right, Grampa?

65
00:07:00.335 --> 00:07:02.494
I want bananas on my waffles.

66
00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:04.420
I rest my case.

67
00:07:05.674 --> 00:07:07.962
I'm not dropping this.

68
00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:15.093
Wait a minute. I'm still in the car.

69
00:07:15.308 --> 00:07:17.217
Oh, right.

70
00:07:22.648 --> 00:07:24.439
"Take out hornets' nest."

71
00:07:31.073 --> 00:07:33.112
Check. "Fix sinkhole."

72
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:43.208
Check.

73
00:07:43.418 --> 00:07:45.209
"Re-shingle roof"?

74
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.252
Steady.

75
00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:54.380
Steady.

76
00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:00.510
Why, you little...!

77
00:08:00.726 --> 00:08:05.055
I'll teach you to laugh
at something that's funny!

78
00:08:05.272 --> 00:08:08.272
You know, we are on the roof.
We could have some fun.

79
00:08:08.608 --> 00:08:10.316
What kind of fun?

80
00:08:10.527 --> 00:08:11.902
How about a dare contest?

81
00:08:12.445 --> 00:08:15.280
That sounds fun. I dare you to...

82
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.032
...climb the TV antenna!

83
00:08:19.285 --> 00:08:21.527
- Piece of cake.
- Earthquake!

84
00:08:28.293 --> 00:08:30.202
Aftershock!

85
00:08:32.464 --> 00:08:35.133
Homer, I don't mean
to be a Nervous Pervis...

86
00:08:35.342 --> 00:08:39.173
...but if he falls, couldn't that
make your boy a paraplege-arino?

87
00:08:39.596 --> 00:08:40.924
Shut up, Flanders.

88
00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:43.843
- Yeah, shut up, Flanders.
- Well said, boy.

89
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.849
Steady. Steady.

90
00:08:48.062 --> 00:08:49.177
Steady...

91
00:08:54.652 --> 00:08:57.059
Hello. Sorry to bother you
on a Sunday...

92
00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:02.320
...but I'm sure you're as worried about
the pollution in Lake Springfield as I am.

93
00:09:07.664 --> 00:09:11.911
Lake Springfield has higher levels
of mercury than ev...

94
00:09:18.507 --> 00:09:21.959
Why, it's the little girl
who saved my cat.

95
00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:23.588
Lake Springfield is...

96
00:09:34.689 --> 00:09:36.349
Come on over, Lisa.

97
00:09:36.566 --> 00:09:39.437
You can canvass me
as long as you want.

98
00:09:39.652 --> 00:09:42.143
Milhouse, you don't care
about the environment.

99
00:09:42.363 --> 00:09:45.032
Hey. I am very passionate
about the planet.

100
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:46.521
Say global warming is a myth.

101
00:09:46.742 --> 00:09:50.158
It's a myth! Further study is needed!

102
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:53.490
That's for selling out your beliefs.

103
00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:56.667
Oh, poor Milhouse.

104
00:09:57.544 --> 00:09:59.537
Dream coming true.

105
00:09:59.755 --> 00:10:02.246
Are you aware that a leaky faucet
can waste over...?

106
00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:03.924
Two thousand gallons a year.

107
00:10:04.134 --> 00:10:06.838
- Turning off lights can save...
- Enough energy to power Pittsburgh.

108
00:10:07.053 --> 00:10:09.211
And if we kept our thermostats
at 68 in winter...

109
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.550
We'd be free from our dependency
on foreign oil in 17 years.

110
00:10:12.767 --> 00:10:14.261
I'm Colin.

111
00:10:14.477 --> 00:10:16.101
I haven't seen you at school.

112
00:10:16.312 --> 00:10:18.186
Moved from Ireland.
My dad's a musician.

113
00:10:18.397 --> 00:10:19.975
- Is he...?
- He's not Bono.

114
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:23.606
- I just thought, because you're Irish and...
- He's not Bono.

115
00:10:24.236 --> 00:10:25.232
Do you play?

116
00:10:25.446 --> 00:10:27.485
Just piano, guitar, trumpet,
drums and bass.

117
00:10:27.906 --> 00:10:32.153
<i>He's pure gold.
For once in your life, be cool.</i>

118
00:10:32.369 --> 00:10:35.488
So is your name as pretty
as your face?

119
00:10:39.542 --> 00:10:41.285
You okay there?

120
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.341
<i>Twisted tail! A thousand eyes!
Trapped forever!</i>

121
00:10:49.844 --> 00:10:51.587
What could that be?

122
00:10:51.804 --> 00:10:54.092
I believe it's the sound
the Green Lantern made...

123
00:10:54.306 --> 00:10:57.342
...when Sinestro threw him
into a vat of acid.

124
00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:02.853
Yeah. Thanks for coming over.

125
00:11:03.064 --> 00:11:05.223
Thanks for giving me
your pregnancy pants.

126
00:11:05.442 --> 00:11:07.819
Never known comfort like this.

127
00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:13.692
Why did I suggest this?

128
00:11:24.668 --> 00:11:26.993
All right, boy,
time for the ultimate dare.

129
00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:33.709
I dare you to skateboard
to Krusty Burger and back...

130
00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:35.754
...naked.

131
00:11:36.137 --> 00:11:37.881
- How naked?
- Fourth base.

132
00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:39.260
Girls might see my doodle.

133
00:11:39.474 --> 00:11:44.432
Oh, I see. Then I hereby
declare you chicken for life.

134
00:11:44.645 --> 00:11:48.595
Every morning, you'll wake up to
"Good morning, chicken."

135
00:11:48.816 --> 00:11:50.607
At your wedding, I'll sing:

136
00:12:04.998 --> 00:12:06.871
I like men now.

137
00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:09.203
Don't look where I'm pointing!

138
00:12:28.645 --> 00:12:31.812
Stop in the name of
American squeamishness!

139
00:12:40.365 --> 00:12:44.444
Boys, before we eat, don't forget
to thank the Lord for this bountiful...

140
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.656
Penis?!

141
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.827
- Bountiful penis.
- Bountiful penis.

142
00:12:48.038 --> 00:12:49.153
Amen.

143
00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:54.289
Listen, kid, nobody likes wearing clothes
in public, but, you know, it's the law.

144
00:12:58.673 --> 00:13:00.500
Lunchtime!

145
00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:02.508
You can't just leave me out here.

146
00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:06.135
Don't worry, we found
a friend for you to play with.

147
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.814
Nelson, honey, where have you been?

148
00:13:22.237 --> 00:13:24.989
- Dad!
- What seems to be the problem, officers?

149
00:13:25.198 --> 00:13:27.025
Tell him you dared me to do it.

150
00:13:27.242 --> 00:13:31.987
If that's true, then you should be
taking the rap here, not your son.

151
00:13:33.498 --> 00:13:36.867
And what happens to me
if it's my fault?

152
00:13:37.085 --> 00:13:39.872
You'll have to attend
a one-hour parenting class.

153
00:13:40.088 --> 00:13:42.661
It was all his idea!
He's out of control, I tell you!

154
00:13:42.882 --> 00:13:44.080
I'm at my wits' end.

155
00:13:44.717 --> 00:13:46.460
It's so...

156
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.844
See you in court, kid.

157
00:13:50.055 --> 00:13:52.178
Okay, son, let's get some lunch.

158
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:54.051
Did you at least bring my clothes?

159
00:13:54.393 --> 00:13:56.184
Shirt, socks, everything you need.

160
00:13:56.395 --> 00:14:00.013
- You didn't bring my pants.
- Who am I, Tommy Bahama?

161
00:14:00.273 --> 00:14:02.017
This is the worst day of my life.

162
00:14:02.233 --> 00:14:05.270
The worst day of your life so far.

163
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.528
- Say, Bart?
- What do you want, Flanders?

164
00:14:11.742 --> 00:14:14.447
If you need pants,
I carry an extra pair.

165
00:14:14.662 --> 00:14:17.366
You know how boys are,
always praying through the knees.

166
00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:19.823
Why are you helping me?
I'm not your kid.

167
00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:23.991
We're neighbors. I'm sure your father
would do the same for my boys.

168
00:14:24.212 --> 00:14:25.623
Thank you.

169
00:14:33.054 --> 00:14:35.675
- Hey, what's with you?
- You really wanna know?

170
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.218
Of course I do.

171
00:14:37.433 --> 00:14:39.889
What kind of a father
wouldn't care about...?

172
00:14:40.102 --> 00:14:41.300
A pig wearing a hat!

173
00:14:42.605 --> 00:14:43.684
Action.

174
00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:48.858
Hey, hey! It's your old pal Krusty,
for my new pork sandwich, the Klogger.

175
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:53.980
If you can find a greasier sandwich,
you're in Mexico!

176
00:14:58.078 --> 00:15:00.403
And we're clear.

177
00:15:00.622 --> 00:15:02.495
Perfect. Cut, print, kill the pig.

178
00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:07.662
What...?! You can't kill him
if he's wearing people clothes!

179
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.722
You're coming home with me.

180
00:15:27.689 --> 00:15:30.310
"A thousand eyes."
What could that be?

181
00:15:31.443 --> 00:15:35.310
I'm pretty sure
a thousand is a number.

182
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:40.275
Hey, Marge. Isn't it great being married
to someone who's recklessly impulsive?

183
00:15:40.493 --> 00:15:42.485
Actually, it's aged me horribly.

184
00:15:42.703 --> 00:15:45.621
Then say hello
to the newest Simpson.

185
00:15:51.753 --> 00:15:53.164
Homer!

186
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.501
I believe what happened in church
was a warning about precisely this.

187
00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:01.759
Please, get rid of that pig.

188
00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:06.929
Oh, you're gonna love him.
Look, he does an impression of you.

189
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.643
You nailed her.

190
00:16:11.856 --> 00:16:14.773
He also does me.

191
00:16:15.526 --> 00:16:17.981
You smiled. I'm off the hook.

192
00:16:26.703 --> 00:16:30.072
Oh, you have so many looks.

193
00:16:47.222 --> 00:16:49.014
So that's what snug is.

194
00:16:49.224 --> 00:16:51.466
Who's a good pig?

195
00:16:52.185 --> 00:16:54.344
Who's a good pig?

196
00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:00.105
Rough day, huh, son?

197
00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:03.689
You don't know what rough is, sister.

198
00:17:03.905 --> 00:17:06.989
Bart, you know, whenever my boys
bake up a batch of frownies...

199
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.528
...I take them fishing.

200
00:17:08.743 --> 00:17:10.901
Does your dad ever take you fishing?

201
00:17:14.081 --> 00:17:17.664
Dad, it's not fair to use a bug zapper
to catch the fish.

202
00:17:17.876 --> 00:17:21.375
If you love fish like I do,
you want them to die with dignity.

203
00:17:26.885 --> 00:17:29.636
I think I have a nibble.

204
00:17:37.603 --> 00:17:39.892
I think fishing might be
more fun with you.

205
00:17:40.106 --> 00:17:42.893
Oh, great. Now, how about
I fix you some cocoa?

206
00:17:43.108 --> 00:17:44.982
No way. Cocoa's for wusses.

207
00:17:45.194 --> 00:17:48.064
Well, sir, if you change your mind,
it's on the windowsill.

208
00:18:08.382 --> 00:18:09.841
Oh, my God.

209
00:18:11.594 --> 00:18:14.678
Oh, wait. I didn't tell you the best part.
He loves the environment.

210
00:18:14.888 --> 00:18:19.467
Oh, wait! I still didn't tell you
the best part. He's got an Irish brogue.

211
00:18:19.685 --> 00:18:22.258
No, no, wait!
I still didn't tell you the best part.

212
00:18:22.479 --> 00:18:24.270
He's not imaginary!

213
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:26.473
Oh, honey, that's great.

214
00:18:26.691 --> 00:18:30.558
But the very best thing
is that he listens to you.

215
00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:34.064
Because nothing means more
than for a man to...

216
00:18:34.282 --> 00:18:37.069
How did the pig tracks
get on the ceiling?

217
00:18:37.285 --> 00:18:39.443
<i>♪ Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig ♪</i>

218
00:18:39.662 --> 00:18:42.117
<i>♪ Does whatever a Spider-Pig does ♪</i>

219
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:44.573
<i>♪ Can he swing from a web? ♪</i>

220
00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:46.831
<i>♪ No, he can't, he's a pig ♪</i>

221
00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:50.911
<i>♪ Look out
He is the Spider-Pig ♪</i>

222
00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:57.386
Are we having fun yet?

223
00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.339
We are now. You've got a bite.

224
00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:01.881
Whoa, mama!

225
00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:04.808
Oh, no, my good pole!

226
00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:11.148
You're not strangling me.

227
00:19:11.358 --> 00:19:13.766
What the...?
Strangling's only good for...

228
00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:16.111
Well, it's not good for anything.

229
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.361
The only time you should
lay hands on a boy...

230
00:19:18.573 --> 00:19:20.400
...is to give him
a good pat on the back.

231
00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:22.526
Hey, what the hell are you...?

232
00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:28.158
One more time.

233
00:19:41.887 --> 00:19:44.129
Honey, I'm home.

234
00:19:49.686 --> 00:19:51.762
We are at the tipping point, people.

235
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.771
If we don't do something now...

236
00:19:55.567 --> 00:19:59.018
I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Isn't he dreamy?

237
00:19:59.237 --> 00:20:00.351
Agreed.

238
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:02.066
Okay, so here's the bottom line:

239
00:20:02.281 --> 00:20:04.357
If we don't change our ways
right now...

240
00:20:04.575 --> 00:20:08.359
...pollution in Lake Springfield
will be at this level.

241
00:20:09.288 --> 00:20:10.616
That's not so bad.

242
00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:13.702
No, the lift is stuck.

243
00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.128
Am I getting through to anyone?

244
00:20:22.342 --> 00:20:24.880
Hell, yeah.
We need a new one of those things.

245
00:20:25.095 --> 00:20:27.383
All in favor of a new scissor lift,
say "aye."

246
00:20:27.597 --> 00:20:29.340
- Aye.
- No!

247
00:20:30.433 --> 00:20:34.596
This lake is just one piece of trash
away from a toxic nightmare.

248
00:20:34.812 --> 00:20:36.223
But I knew you wouldn't listen.

249
00:20:36.439 --> 00:20:40.222
So I took the liberty of pouring water
from the lake in all your drinking glasses.

250
00:20:42.236 --> 00:20:44.312
This is why we should hate kids.

251
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.988
This is serious, people.

252
00:20:46.198 --> 00:20:50.575
No more dumping in the lake.
I hereby declare a state of emergency.

253
00:20:50.785 --> 00:20:52.114
Code black.

254
00:20:53.246 --> 00:20:56.994
Black? That's the worst color there is.

255
00:20:57.208 --> 00:20:59.960
- No offense there, Carl.
- I get it all the time.

256
00:21:17.185 --> 00:21:19.676
Sorry, sorry. No dumping in the lake.

257
00:21:19.896 --> 00:21:25.732
Fine. I will put my yard trimmings
in a car compactor.

258
00:21:26.903 --> 00:21:29.061
Chief, I think there was
a dead body in there.

259
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.530
I thought that too,
until he said "yard trimmings."

260
00:21:32.742 --> 00:21:34.450
You gotta learn to listen, Lou.

261
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.989
Let us now make sure
this barrier is completely idiot-proof.

262
00:21:39.206 --> 00:21:41.199
- Cletus.
- Yessum?

263
00:21:41.417 --> 00:21:43.456
Try to dump something in the lake.

264
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:45.377
Okay.

265
00:21:53.428 --> 00:21:56.179
I can't. I simply can't.

266
00:21:56.389 --> 00:21:57.967
- Brilliant.
- Very effective.

267
00:22:10.027 --> 00:22:12.600
Don't get any ideas.

268
00:22:16.366 --> 00:22:20.031
Maybe we should kiss,
just to break the tension.

269
00:22:20.245 --> 00:22:22.154
What's going on here?

270
00:22:22.372 --> 00:22:23.451
Nothing. Nothing.

271
00:22:23.665 --> 00:22:25.990
I'm not sure that pig
should be in the house.

272
00:22:26.209 --> 00:22:30.206
And by the way,
what are you doing with his leavings?

273
00:22:30.421 --> 00:22:34.205
Don't worry.
I've devised a most elegant solution.

274
00:22:36.385 --> 00:22:37.879
It's leaking.

275
00:22:38.095 --> 00:22:41.630
It's not leaking, it's overflowing.

276
00:22:41.849 --> 00:22:45.798
He filled up the whole silo
in just two days?

277
00:22:46.019 --> 00:22:47.015
Well, I helped.

278
00:22:47.229 --> 00:22:52.519
Homer, stop! Stop. I know it's easy
for your mind to wander...

279
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.524
...but I want you to
really concentrate on me.

280
00:23:00.741 --> 00:23:05.617
I can't escape the feeling that this
is the crisis Grampa warned us about.

281
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.996
You have to dispose
of that waste properly.

282
00:23:09.583 --> 00:23:11.540
Okay, Marge. I will.

283
00:23:11.752 --> 00:23:13.661
You can take Spider-Pig with you.

284
00:23:13.879 --> 00:23:17.212
He's not Spider-Pig anymore,
he's Harry Plopper.

285
00:23:30.978 --> 00:23:31.974
Hello.

286
00:23:32.188 --> 00:23:33.563
Homer, you gotta get over here.

287
00:23:33.773 --> 00:23:37.391
Health inspector shut down the doughnut
store, they're giving out free doughnuts!

288
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.563
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
I just got one thing I gotta do first.

289
00:23:40.779 --> 00:23:44.230
Well, you better hurry.
They're going fast.

290
00:23:45.075 --> 00:23:47.067
Whoa, that was close.

291
00:24:28.157 --> 00:24:30.730
<i>Evil!</i>

292
00:24:32.411 --> 00:24:34.451
Drive, drive, drive!

293
00:24:34.914 --> 00:24:36.538
Oh, right.

294
00:25:03.023 --> 00:25:06.357
Look at that. You can see
the four states that border Springfield:

295
00:25:06.568 --> 00:25:10.233
Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky.

296
00:25:10.697 --> 00:25:11.776
Oh, yeah.

297
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:15.324
And if you look real close,
you can almost...

298
00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:21.161
Well, this certainly seems odd...

299
00:25:21.374 --> 00:25:25.074
...but who am I to question
the work of the Almighty?

300
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:30.417
We thank you, Lord,
for this mighty fine intelligent design.

301
00:25:30.633 --> 00:25:32.506
Good job.

302
00:25:33.219 --> 00:25:35.425
Jabbity, jabbity, jab, jab, jab!

303
00:25:35.638 --> 00:25:37.796
Hey! Jab one more eye
and it's a federal crime.

304
00:25:39.057 --> 00:25:41.809
- Who are you?
- Environmental Protection Agency.

305
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:53.187
Russ Cargill, head of the EPA,
here to see the president.

306
00:25:58.826 --> 00:25:59.941
Mr. President.

307
00:26:01.412 --> 00:26:02.610
<i>Ja, that is me.</i>

308
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.495
Pollution in Springfield
has reached crisis levels.

309
00:26:07.501 --> 00:26:11.545
I hate this job. Everything's "crisis" this
and "end of the world" that.

310
00:26:11.755 --> 00:26:14.590
Nobody opens with a joke.
I miss Danny De Vito.

311
00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:18.464
You want a joke, huh?
Stop me if you've heard this one.

312
00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:22.680
Look at those angry eyes
and giant teeth.

313
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.848
It's like Christmas
at the Kennedy compound.

314
00:26:25.268 --> 00:26:28.138
You know, sir, when you
made me head of the EPA...

315
00:26:28.354 --> 00:26:31.723
...you appointed one of
the most successful men in America...

316
00:26:31.941 --> 00:26:34.099
...to the least successful agency
in government.

317
00:26:34.318 --> 00:26:36.227
And why did I take the job?

318
00:26:36.445 --> 00:26:39.150
Because I'm a rich man
who wanted to give something back.

319
00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:40.906
Not the money, but something.

320
00:26:41.116 --> 00:26:45.279
So here is our chance to
kick some ass for Mother Earth.

321
00:26:45.495 --> 00:26:48.200
- I'm listening.
- Well, I've narrowed your choices down...

322
00:26:48.415 --> 00:26:50.372
...to five unthinkable options.

323
00:26:50.583 --> 00:26:52.161
Each will cause untold misery...

324
00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:53.871
I pick number three.

325
00:26:54.087 --> 00:26:55.664
You don't wanna read them first?

326
00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.498
I was elected to lead, not to read.
Number three!

327
00:27:40.797 --> 00:27:43.751
We're being sealed in a dome!

328
00:27:46.094 --> 00:27:47.802
What do I do?
I don't know what to do!

329
00:27:48.012 --> 00:27:50.135
If I stay, I'm trapped.
If I leave, I'm alone.

330
00:27:50.348 --> 00:27:52.008
Oh, God. In, out, in, out!

331
00:27:52.225 --> 00:27:53.304
I never saw Venice.

332
00:28:06.989 --> 00:28:08.531
"Trapped forever."

333
00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.065
It's all come true.

334
00:28:11.284 --> 00:28:14.867
That crazy old man in church
was right.

335
00:28:18.833 --> 00:28:23.993
Dome!

336
00:28:39.853 --> 00:28:41.477
All right, men, open fire.

337
00:28:43.732 --> 00:28:45.475
Who's hurt? Raise your hands.

338
00:28:47.402 --> 00:28:48.481
Without the attitude.

339
00:28:48.695 --> 00:28:51.268
People, people.
I have an important announcement.

340
00:28:51.614 --> 00:28:54.698
I have just perfected
an acid-firing super-drill...

341
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:57.863
- ...which can cut through anything.
- Hey, that's cool.

342
00:28:58.079 --> 00:28:59.241
It's right there.

343
00:28:59.455 --> 00:29:03.155
Just outside of the dome.

344
00:29:04.877 --> 00:29:08.376
What ruthless madmen
could have done this to us?

345
00:29:08.588 --> 00:29:10.166
<i>The United States government.</i>

346
00:29:12.801 --> 00:29:15.173
<i>My name is Russ Cargill
and I'm head of the EPA.</i>

347
00:29:16.679 --> 00:29:17.675
The what?

348
00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:20.344
<i>- Environmental Protection Agency.
- Come again?</i>

349
00:29:20.558 --> 00:29:22.883
<i>Look, I'm a man on a big TV.
Just listen.</i>

350
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:25.676
<i>- Springfield has become...
- Springfield!</i>

351
00:29:25.938 --> 00:29:28.394
<i>The most polluted city
in the history of the planet.</i>

352
00:29:28.607 --> 00:29:29.936
Drama queen!

353
00:29:30.526 --> 00:29:32.234
<i>To keep your poisons
from spreading...</i>

354
00:29:32.444 --> 00:29:34.520
<i>...your government has sealed you
in this dome.</i>

355
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.031
<i>It's the last thing we wanted to do.</i>

356
00:29:38.241 --> 00:29:40.779
<i>I own the company that makes
the dome, but that's beside the point.</i>

357
00:29:40.994 --> 00:29:42.702
You mean we're trapped like rats?

358
00:29:42.912 --> 00:29:48.073
<i>No, rats can't be trapped this easily.
You're trapped like carrots.</i>

359
00:29:49.127 --> 00:29:53.623
Wait. We couldn't be more polluted.
Everyone stopped dumping in the lake.

360
00:29:53.839 --> 00:29:55.998
<i>Apparently someone
didn't get the message.</i>

361
00:29:57.927 --> 00:29:59.884
Act natural.

362
00:30:00.095 --> 00:30:03.594
Hey, buddy, sooner or later,
people are gonna discover this.

363
00:30:03.807 --> 00:30:07.591
<i>Don't worry about that. We found
a way to take you off the map.</i>

364
00:30:09.312 --> 00:30:11.471
<i>Coming up on your right:</i>

365
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.314
<i>Nothing.</i>

366
00:30:13.566 --> 00:30:16.686
This is Kent Brockman,
reporting to you on a crisis so serious...

367
00:30:16.903 --> 00:30:18.942
...it has its own name
and theme music.

368
00:30:22.158 --> 00:30:24.281
The dome has put an end
to life as we know it.

369
00:30:24.493 --> 00:30:29.618
The town is running low on supplies of
everything from gasoline to Botox.

370
00:30:29.832 --> 00:30:31.789
Moment, please.

371
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:39.296
Now, as always, we end our news
on "The Lighter Side."

372
00:30:39.508 --> 00:30:42.923
It's the time of year when
the swallows return to Springfield.

373
00:30:54.772 --> 00:30:58.472
I think the thing I miss most
is a simple summer breeze.

374
00:31:04.323 --> 00:31:06.114
Maggie?

375
00:31:07.534 --> 00:31:10.950
<i>We've got dome wax, dome polish,
dome freshener, all your dome needs...</i>

376
00:31:11.204 --> 00:31:13.493
<i>...at Dome Depot,
located at the 105 and the dome.</i>

377
00:31:13.706 --> 00:31:15.865
<i>Dome Depot!</i>

378
00:31:16.084 --> 00:31:18.076
Maggie got out! Maggie got out!

379
00:31:20.546 --> 00:31:24.378
Maggie was right there,
just outside the dome.

380
00:31:24.592 --> 00:31:26.833
Marge, she's right here.

381
00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:32.217
This dome can play tricks on you.
You just have to keep calm and...

382
00:31:32.432 --> 00:31:33.630
Oh, my God.

383
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:38.512
I'm out of the dome.
Fresh air! Freedom!

384
00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:41.105
I'll write you. Lead good lives!

385
00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:59.038
<i>Good evening, this is Kent Brockman.</i>

386
00:31:59.249 --> 00:32:01.954
<i>Efforts to find out
whose selfish crime...</i>

387
00:32:02.169 --> 00:32:04.494
<i>...caused our entrapment
have been fruitless.</i>

388
00:32:05.505 --> 00:32:06.584
<i>Until moments ago!</i>

389
00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.172
<i>A shocking discovery has been made
here at Lake Springfield.</i>

390
00:32:11.886 --> 00:32:14.342
That could be anybody's pig-crap silo.

391
00:32:18.392 --> 00:32:22.093
Homer, it was you.

392
00:32:22.313 --> 00:32:24.982
You single-handedly killed this town.

393
00:32:25.191 --> 00:32:27.432
I know. It's weird.

394
00:32:27.651 --> 00:32:31.067
<i>Just a reminder, this station does not
endorse vigilante justice.</i>

395
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.901
<i>Unless it gets results. Which it will.</i>

396
00:32:35.742 --> 00:32:39.787
You didn't listen to me
after I warned you.

397
00:32:39.996 --> 00:32:43.531
Don't worry,
nobody watches this stupid show.

398
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.956
What's that ominous glow
in the distance?

399
00:32:48.963 --> 00:32:51.252
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

400
00:33:00.265 --> 00:33:03.848
Marge, look. Those idiots
don't even know where we live.

401
00:33:05.187 --> 00:33:07.013
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

402
00:33:08.356 --> 00:33:11.191
<i>We want Homer! We want Homer!</i>

403
00:33:11.401 --> 00:33:14.188
You monster. You monster!

404
00:33:14.654 --> 00:33:15.816
Did you see the news?

405
00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:17.939
Honey, come on,
we have bigger problems.

406
00:33:18.157 --> 00:33:20.399
But I'm so angry.

407
00:33:20.618 --> 00:33:24.069
You're a woman.
You can hold on to it forever.

408
00:33:25.664 --> 00:33:26.945
Okay.

409
00:33:27.666 --> 00:33:31.580
Homer, you have to go out there,
face that mob...

410
00:33:31.795 --> 00:33:34.084
...and apologize for what you did.

411
00:33:34.297 --> 00:33:37.547
I would, but I'm afraid if I open the door,
they'll take all of you.

412
00:33:37.759 --> 00:33:39.752
No, we won't. We just want Homer!

413
00:33:39.969 --> 00:33:42.176
Well, maybe not you,
but they'll kill Grampa.

414
00:33:42.388 --> 00:33:44.096
I'm part of the mob!

415
00:33:46.809 --> 00:33:48.766
Teeny! Take out the baby.

416
00:34:02.741 --> 00:34:04.947
Here, let me get that for you.

417
00:34:11.666 --> 00:34:14.371
Stay back. I got a chain saw.

418
00:34:25.721 --> 00:34:26.717
Bart!

419
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:28.389
Crawl across. Hurry.

420
00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:30.887
But if they see you helping us,
they'll kill you.

421
00:34:31.101 --> 00:34:33.722
I'm sure your father would
do the same for...

422
00:34:35.063 --> 00:34:37.352
Point taken. Now, hustle your bustles.

423
00:34:41.027 --> 00:34:42.402
Archers.

424
00:34:43.029 --> 00:34:45.602
I'm using a red arrow
so I know who I kill.

425
00:34:49.118 --> 00:34:53.198
No, Plopper.
If you push that, Daddy will die.

426
00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.497
Hey, my luck's beginning to turn.

427
00:35:05.091 --> 00:35:06.883
Wait! There's something I have to get.

428
00:35:24.234 --> 00:35:26.026
- What'd you get?
- Our wedding video.

429
00:35:27.488 --> 00:35:29.729
- We have a wedding video?
- Torch his gas tank!

430
00:35:33.869 --> 00:35:35.826
We lost them.

431
00:35:50.426 --> 00:35:52.003
Up here.

432
00:35:53.429 --> 00:35:54.424
Get them! Get them!

433
00:35:59.268 --> 00:36:00.596
Little help?

434
00:36:05.231 --> 00:36:07.936
You know, the word "apology"...

435
00:36:08.151 --> 00:36:13.856
...is tossed around a lot these days,
but when it comes from in here...

436
00:36:25.459 --> 00:36:28.294
Mom, what are we gonna do?

437
00:36:30.505 --> 00:36:31.834
Maggie, not now.

438
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.712
We'll play later.

439
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.803
The sinkhole. Follow me, kids!

440
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.096
- Geronimo!
- Sacajawea!

441
00:36:53.444 --> 00:36:56.017
So long, losers!

442
00:37:02.285 --> 00:37:05.405
The top of his head is still showing.
Claw at it!

443
00:37:39.362 --> 00:37:43.276
Well, they're China's problem now.

444
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:54.413
Colin!

445
00:38:01.258 --> 00:38:03.380
I can't hear you!

446
00:38:23.612 --> 00:38:27.941
I never thought my life would have an
absolutely perfect moment, but this is...

447
00:38:28.158 --> 00:38:31.657
Lisa's got a boyfriend
that she'll never see again!

448
00:38:32.954 --> 00:38:34.745
Perfect.

449
00:38:45.299 --> 00:38:49.083
- What do we do?
- Now we run.

450
00:38:52.973 --> 00:38:54.598
I'm afraid we lost them, sir.

451
00:38:54.808 --> 00:38:56.136
Damn it!

452
00:38:56.351 --> 00:38:59.269
Well, then, you find them
and you get them back in the dome.

453
00:38:59.479 --> 00:39:00.890
And so nobody else gets out...

454
00:39:01.106 --> 00:39:03.775
...I want roving death squads
around the perimeter 24/7.

455
00:39:03.983 --> 00:39:05.264
I want 10,000 tough guys...

456
00:39:05.485 --> 00:39:08.688
...and I want 10,000 soft guys
to make the tough guys look tougher.

457
00:39:08.905 --> 00:39:12.108
And here's how I want them arranged:
Tough, tough, soft, tough...

458
00:39:12.325 --> 00:39:17.319
...soft, soft, tough, tough,
soft, soft, tough, soft.

459
00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:20.872
Sir, I'm afraid you've
gone mad with power.

460
00:39:21.083 --> 00:39:25.080
Of course. Ever try going mad without
power? It's boring. No one listens to you.

461
00:39:54.531 --> 00:39:57.532
- Bart, are you drinking whiskey?
- I'm troubled.

462
00:39:57.742 --> 00:39:59.984
- Bart.
- I promise, I'll stop tomorrow.

463
00:40:00.203 --> 00:40:02.611
You'll stop right now.

464
00:40:06.918 --> 00:40:08.376
You come back here, little man.

465
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.757
I miss Flanders. There, I said it!

466
00:40:16.302 --> 00:40:18.175
- Where's your father?
- He went out.

467
00:40:18.387 --> 00:40:20.842
Let's quickly rebuild our lives
while he's gone.

468
00:40:21.056 --> 00:40:22.681
Hey, guys?

469
00:40:23.141 --> 00:40:25.679
What's the secret knock, again?

470
00:40:28.563 --> 00:40:32.014
Look, I know I screwed up. This is big.

471
00:40:32.233 --> 00:40:34.605
It's huge! We're homeless!

472
00:40:34.819 --> 00:40:36.895
Our friends wanna kill us!

473
00:40:37.113 --> 00:40:39.520
Before we can even stay
in the same room with you...

474
00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.196
...I need to know what was
going through your mind...

475
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:44.698
...when you didn't listen to me...

476
00:40:44.912 --> 00:40:48.411
...and dumped that silo in the lake.

477
00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:49.870
Homer!

478
00:40:50.084 --> 00:40:53.702
I don't know what to tell you, Marge.
I don't think about things.

479
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.043
I respect people who do...

480
00:40:56.256 --> 00:41:01.760
...but I just try to make the days not hurt
until I get to crawl in next to you again.

481
00:41:04.597 --> 00:41:05.628
I mean, oh.

482
00:41:06.099 --> 00:41:10.013
Look, I'm really sorry.
But I'm more than just sorry...

483
00:41:10.228 --> 00:41:12.054
...I'm prepared with a solution.

484
00:41:12.646 --> 00:41:16.858
I've always been afraid I'd screw up our
lives so badly we'd need a backup plan.

485
00:41:17.693 --> 00:41:21.773
And that plan is right here!

486
00:41:23.949 --> 00:41:24.945
No.

487
00:41:25.158 --> 00:41:26.237
Nope.

488
00:41:26.451 --> 00:41:28.076
Bingo.

489
00:41:31.748 --> 00:41:33.076
Bear with me.

490
00:41:38.087 --> 00:41:39.166
Alaska?

491
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.330
Alaska. A place where you can't be
too fat or too drunk.

492
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:45.211
Where no one says things like:

493
00:41:45.427 --> 00:41:48.796
"Let's see your high school
equivalency certificate."

494
00:41:49.515 --> 00:41:51.139
I don't know, Homie.

495
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.768
I'm not saying it right.

496
00:41:53.977 --> 00:41:57.678
Look, the thing is,
I can't start a new life alone.

497
00:41:57.898 --> 00:42:00.649
And I've really come to like you guys.

498
00:42:02.485 --> 00:42:05.058
I just don't see it.

499
00:42:09.075 --> 00:42:12.775
Marge, in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

500
00:42:12.995 --> 00:42:15.237
"I need you to do this with me."

501
00:42:17.791 --> 00:42:21.207
And there's only one answer
when somebody says that.

502
00:42:26.675 --> 00:42:29.960
Okay, Homie, I'm with you.

503
00:42:30.178 --> 00:42:31.838
Thank you, my sweetheart.

504
00:42:32.388 --> 00:42:34.215
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

505
00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:36.676
You just bought
another load of crap...

506
00:42:36.893 --> 00:42:39.929
...from the world's fattest
fertilizer salesman.

507
00:42:40.146 --> 00:42:42.637
You'll pay for ruining
this golden family moment!

508
00:42:42.857 --> 00:42:43.852
Homer!

509
00:42:44.066 --> 00:42:47.351
How are we supposed to get to Alaska
without any money?

510
00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:52.030
All right, son. If you don't believe in me,
believe in America.

511
00:42:52.699 --> 00:42:58.784
America. Where any man can make
quick money with no questions asked.

512
00:43:01.374 --> 00:43:03.450
Step right up and win my truck!

513
00:43:03.668 --> 00:43:06.953
All you have to do is conquer
the Ball of Death.

514
00:43:07.171 --> 00:43:08.546
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

515
00:43:08.756 --> 00:43:12.670
Just ride the motorcycle
all the way around just one time.

516
00:43:12.885 --> 00:43:14.961
Three tries for $ 10.

517
00:43:15.346 --> 00:43:18.465
- Marge, how much money do we have?
- Ten dollars.

518
00:43:20.892 --> 00:43:22.435
That counts as a try.

519
00:43:26.815 --> 00:43:28.475
That's two.

520
00:43:30.819 --> 00:43:32.017
And that's three.

521
00:43:32.237 --> 00:43:34.988
Here's what I'll do,
because I like seeing you hurt yourself:

522
00:43:35.198 --> 00:43:36.656
I'll give you one on the house.

523
00:43:36.866 --> 00:43:38.693
- You're the best.
- Dad!

524
00:43:38.909 --> 00:43:42.574
When you get to the top,
don't slow down, speed up!

525
00:43:42.788 --> 00:43:45.742
- But that's when it's the scariest.
- Just do it!

526
00:43:57.886 --> 00:43:59.380
Yes!

527
00:44:01.514 --> 00:44:03.388
Yay, Dad!

528
00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:12.645
I'll take that truck now.

529
00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:17.810
Oh, man. My wives are gonna kill me.

530
00:44:20.073 --> 00:44:23.608
Next stop, Alaska!

531
00:44:29.415 --> 00:44:31.408
<i>Day 37 under the dome.</i>

532
00:44:31.626 --> 00:44:35.493
<i>We are facing intermittent
power failures which...</i>

533
00:44:38.632 --> 00:44:41.882
Okay, very funny.
I'm gonna turn the lights off again.

534
00:44:42.094 --> 00:44:45.178
When they come back on,
I want all my booze back the way it was.

535
00:44:49.851 --> 00:44:52.936
Yeah, okay. Okay.

536
00:44:59.611 --> 00:45:03.608
I'm very proud of you, Bart.
Over 24 hours sober.

537
00:45:03.823 --> 00:45:06.112
- You are, aren't you?
- I'll prove it.

538
00:45:12.081 --> 00:45:15.912
We're giving your father another chance,
and we owe it to him to...

539
00:45:17.336 --> 00:45:18.794
- Oh, my God.
- Can I help you?

540
00:45:21.339 --> 00:45:22.834
We need diapers.

541
00:45:23.049 --> 00:45:25.256
- Okay.
- No. No, we don't. We don't.

542
00:45:25.468 --> 00:45:27.377
- Ladies' razorblades.
- Right.

543
00:45:27.595 --> 00:45:31.593
No! No. No, we don't.
I forgot, we're European.

544
00:45:32.141 --> 00:45:33.552
Just give us beef jerky.

545
00:45:33.768 --> 00:45:36.519
Lots and lots of beef jerky.

546
00:45:36.729 --> 00:45:39.599
That's right. That's what we need.
That's all we came in for.

547
00:45:39.815 --> 00:45:41.144
Sure.

548
00:45:44.486 --> 00:45:46.693
Oh, my God. There they are!

549
00:46:06.299 --> 00:46:10.213
So you want some of my electricity,
do you?

550
00:46:11.512 --> 00:46:14.797
Well, for once,
the rich white man is in control.

551
00:46:15.015 --> 00:46:17.138
I have two buttons behind this desk.

552
00:46:17.351 --> 00:46:21.977
One will supply your town with power,
the other releases the hounds.

553
00:46:22.272 --> 00:46:24.977
Reach me. Make me your brother.

554
00:46:25.233 --> 00:46:27.391
The hospital's generator
is about to give out.

555
00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:28.855
Lives will be lost.

556
00:46:29.195 --> 00:46:32.813
"Lives lost." Go on.

557
00:46:33.032 --> 00:46:36.152
We got a convict we were gonna
fry tomorrow, but now we can't.

558
00:46:36.369 --> 00:46:38.741
Tempting. Tempting.

559
00:46:38.954 --> 00:46:40.662
Look, all our reasons mean nothing.

560
00:46:40.873 --> 00:46:44.573
Just look into your heart
and you'll find the answer.

561
00:46:48.046 --> 00:46:50.881
- First door on the right.
- Thank you.

562
00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:02.722
What...? This isn't the way
I pictured Alaska at all!

563
00:47:02.935 --> 00:47:04.394
Oh, that's better.

564
00:47:04.604 --> 00:47:06.347
Homer!

565
00:47:12.778 --> 00:47:15.613
Well, at least my poster
didn't get torn.

566
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:29.994
Welcome to Alaska. Here's $ 1000.

567
00:47:30.211 --> 00:47:32.784
Well, it's about time! But why?

568
00:47:33.005 --> 00:47:34.962
We pay every resident $ 1000...

569
00:47:35.174 --> 00:47:38.091
...to allow oil companies to ravage
our state's natural beauty.

570
00:47:38.302 --> 00:47:40.378
I'm home!

571
00:47:40.596 --> 00:47:42.469
Oh, thanks.

572
00:47:59.947 --> 00:48:01.739
What are you doing, Bart?

573
00:48:01.949 --> 00:48:03.408
Just passing the time.

574
00:48:17.047 --> 00:48:20.629
My boy loves Alaska so much,
he's applauding it.

575
00:48:20.842 --> 00:48:23.298
- Lisa, why aren't you clapping?
- But, Dad...

576
00:48:23.511 --> 00:48:24.970
Clap for Alaska!

577
00:48:42.154 --> 00:48:46.531
Well, Marge, we're separated
from the kids by a wall of snow.

578
00:48:46.742 --> 00:48:50.490
All my dreams are coming true.

579
00:49:21.566 --> 00:49:23.226
We're going to need more birds.

580
00:49:44.755 --> 00:49:46.546
Day 93 under the dome.

581
00:49:46.756 --> 00:49:49.045
With necessities growing
dangerously low...

582
00:49:49.259 --> 00:49:52.213
...who knows what spark will set off
this powder keg?

583
00:49:53.638 --> 00:49:55.844
<i>- Let's discuss Tuesdays with Morrie.
- Again?</i>

584
00:49:56.057 --> 00:49:58.726
If we don't get a new book,
I'm going to puke.

585
00:49:58.935 --> 00:50:02.600
You're the five people
I'm going to meet in hell!

586
00:50:04.565 --> 00:50:06.557
We're out of coffee!

587
00:50:08.694 --> 00:50:11.944
I can't take another minute
in this dome!

588
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:24.664
Take that.

589
00:50:25.043 --> 00:50:26.501
Oh, no! Blowback!

590
00:50:32.967 --> 00:50:34.627
Look what they're doing to our dome.

591
00:50:42.267 --> 00:50:43.512
You know what that is, sir?

592
00:50:43.727 --> 00:50:45.435
- A crack?
- Exactly.

593
00:50:45.645 --> 00:50:48.812
People got out of the dome before,
they're gonna get out again.

594
00:50:49.024 --> 00:50:51.859
When they do, there's gonna be
hearings, investigations...

595
00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:55.816
I'll have to go back to
making family comedies.

596
00:50:57.824 --> 00:50:59.863
Don't worry,
I have a solution for you, sir.

597
00:51:00.076 --> 00:51:02.613
In fact, I have five solutions.

598
00:51:02.828 --> 00:51:05.284
You don't have to read them.
You'll have deniability.

599
00:51:05.497 --> 00:51:07.289
I'll take care of it. You know nothing.

600
00:51:08.333 --> 00:51:10.291
No. I need to know
what I'm approving.

601
00:51:10.502 --> 00:51:14.416
Absolutely. But on the other hand,
knowing things is overrated.

602
00:51:14.631 --> 00:51:16.956
Anyone can pick something
when they know what it is.

603
00:51:17.175 --> 00:51:20.508
It takes real leadership to pick
something you're clueless about.

604
00:51:21.596 --> 00:51:23.138
- Okay, I pick three.
- Try again.

605
00:51:23.348 --> 00:51:25.139
- One. Five?
- Go higher. Too high.

606
00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:26.464
- Three?
- You said three.

607
00:51:26.684 --> 00:51:28.475
- Six? Two?
- There is no six. Double it.

608
00:51:28.686 --> 00:51:30.014
- Four!
- As you wish, sir.

609
00:51:42.783 --> 00:51:46.234
<i>Are you tired of
the same old Grand Canyon?</i>

610
00:51:46.453 --> 00:51:49.323
Here we are, kids, the Grand Canyon.

611
00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:53.868
It's so old and boring.
I want a new one. Now!

612
00:51:54.085 --> 00:51:56.208
Hello. I'm Tom Hanks.

613
00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:58.709
The U.S. Government
has lost its credibility...

614
00:51:58.923 --> 00:52:00.583
...so it's borrowing some of mine.

615
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.175
Tousle my hair, Mr. Hanks.

616
00:52:02.384 --> 00:52:04.341
Sure thing, son.

617
00:52:06.096 --> 00:52:09.180
Now, I'm pleased to tell you all
about the New Grand Canyon.

618
00:52:10.601 --> 00:52:12.889
<i>This weekend. East of Shelbyville
and south of Capitol City.</i>

619
00:52:13.395 --> 00:52:14.972
That's where Springfield is!

620
00:52:15.188 --> 00:52:17.560
It's nowhere near where
anything is or ever was.

621
00:52:17.774 --> 00:52:18.937
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

622
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:22.151
If you're going to pick a government
to trust, why not this one?

623
00:52:22.695 --> 00:52:23.691
Did you see that?

624
00:52:23.905 --> 00:52:26.609
Yes, they're going
to destroy Springfield.

625
00:52:26.824 --> 00:52:28.567
But we're going to stop them.

626
00:52:28.784 --> 00:52:31.571
Homie, get your clothes on. Homie?

627
00:52:31.787 --> 00:52:34.076
I'm happy here. Screw Springfield!

628
00:52:35.541 --> 00:52:38.577
I can't believe you'd say
something so selfish.

629
00:52:38.794 --> 00:52:41.960
Marge, those people chased us
with pitchforks and torches.

630
00:52:42.172 --> 00:52:44.544
Torches! At 4 in the afternoon!

631
00:52:44.758 --> 00:52:47.545
<i>- It was 7 at night.
- It was during Access Hollywood.</i>

632
00:52:47.761 --> 00:52:49.587
Which is on at 4 and 7.

633
00:52:50.346 --> 00:52:53.632
Dad, how can you turn your back
on everyone who loved us?

634
00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:55.641
Flanders helped
when we were in trouble.

635
00:52:55.852 --> 00:52:57.891
Who cares what he did?
He's not your father.

636
00:52:58.104 --> 00:52:59.266
I wish he was.

637
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.472
You don't mean that.
You worship me.

638
00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:04.015
Oh, yeah?
Look what I did to your picture.

639
00:53:04.693 --> 00:53:05.689
Look at it.

640
00:53:05.944 --> 00:53:07.771
How-dilly-doo-dilly.
How-dilly-doo-dilly.

641
00:53:07.988 --> 00:53:09.447
Why, you little...!

642
00:53:10.449 --> 00:53:11.991
I'll strangle-angle you!

643
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.481
Diddily-diddily.

644
00:53:13.702 --> 00:53:16.027
Bart, stop it! Leave this to me.

645
00:53:17.372 --> 00:53:19.115
Homer...

646
00:53:19.666 --> 00:53:23.200
...in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

647
00:53:23.419 --> 00:53:26.503
"I need you to do this with me."

648
00:53:27.965 --> 00:53:31.666
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

649
00:53:31.886 --> 00:53:33.048
Homer Simpson!

650
00:53:33.262 --> 00:53:34.804
We're saving Springfield!

651
00:53:35.013 --> 00:53:37.172
Listen to me, all of you.
We are staying.

652
00:53:37.391 --> 00:53:38.933
We have a great life in Alaska...

653
00:53:39.142 --> 00:53:42.392
...and we're never going
back to America again.

654
00:53:42.604 --> 00:53:44.561
I have spoken!

655
00:54:04.249 --> 00:54:09.326
Well, I guess I've let her
worry about me long enough.

656
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:24.054
Marge? Kids?

657
00:54:37.406 --> 00:54:39.279
<i>Okay, here goes.</i>

658
00:54:39.491 --> 00:54:40.866
<i>Homer...</i>

659
00:54:41.076 --> 00:54:43.033
<i>...I've always stood up for you.</i>

660
00:54:43.245 --> 00:54:46.364
<i>When people point out your flaws...</i>

661
00:54:46.581 --> 00:54:48.372
<i>...I always say:</i>

662
00:54:48.583 --> 00:54:53.660
<i>"Well, sometimes you have to
stand back to appreciate a work of art. "</i>

663
00:54:54.922 --> 00:54:56.416
Way back.

664
00:54:56.632 --> 00:54:59.882
<i>Lately, what's keeping us together...</i>

665
00:55:00.094 --> 00:55:04.340
<i>...is my ability to overlook
everything you do.</i>

666
00:55:04.556 --> 00:55:08.305
<i>And I overlook these things
because...</i>

667
00:55:08.643 --> 00:55:09.888
Because?

668
00:55:10.896 --> 00:55:13.054
<i>Well, that's the thing.</i>

669
00:55:13.273 --> 00:55:17.520
<i>I just don't know how to finish
that sentence anymore.</i>

670
00:55:18.319 --> 00:55:22.103
<i>So I'm leaving with the kids
to help Springfield...</i>

671
00:55:22.323 --> 00:55:24.944
<i>...and we're never coming back.</i>

672
00:55:28.037 --> 00:55:31.702
<i>And to prove to myself
that this is the end...</i>

673
00:55:32.958 --> 00:55:36.825
<i>...I taped this over our wedding video.</i>

674
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:40.252
<i>Goodbye, Homie.</i>

675
00:55:53.644 --> 00:55:56.396
<i>I love you.</i>

676
00:55:59.942 --> 00:56:02.397
Marge? Kids?

677
00:56:54.827 --> 00:56:57.697
- So, Mom, what's our plan?
- What are you doing up there?

678
00:56:57.913 --> 00:56:59.621
Looking through people's luggage.

679
00:56:59.832 --> 00:57:02.749
I'm the mascot of an evil corporation.

680
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.459
Get down from there.
We have to keep a low profile...

681
00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:10.751
...till we get to Seattle to tell the world
of the plot to destroy Springfield.

682
00:57:10.967 --> 00:57:13.458
I don't know if you guys
should be talking so loud.

683
00:57:13.678 --> 00:57:17.972
Oh, Lisa, it's not like the government
is listening to everybody's conversation.

684
00:57:26.315 --> 00:57:28.640
<i>Hi, I'm calling about
your Meat Lover's pizza.</i>

685
00:57:28.859 --> 00:57:31.979
<i>I like meat, but I don't know
if I'm ready to love again.</i>

686
00:57:32.196 --> 00:57:35.446
<i>- You hang up first.
- No, you hang up first.</i>

687
00:57:35.657 --> 00:57:36.986
<i>Okay.</i>

688
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.027
<i>She hung up on me!</i>

689
00:57:39.244 --> 00:57:43.573
<i>But we're fugitives. We should
just lay low till we get to Seattle.</i>

690
00:57:43.915 --> 00:57:45.658
Hey, everybody, I found one!

691
00:57:45.875 --> 00:57:49.742
The government actually found
someone we're looking for!

692
00:57:49.962 --> 00:57:51.789
Yeah, baby, yeah!

693
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:54.794
Homer Simpson...

694
00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.552
...do you know why you are here?

695
00:57:58.762 --> 00:58:02.676
Because my family cares more about
other people than they do about me.

696
00:58:02.891 --> 00:58:05.263
Drink this liquid.

697
00:58:07.729 --> 00:58:09.223
More, please.

698
00:58:10.023 --> 00:58:12.099
Now we will cleanse your spirit...

699
00:58:12.317 --> 00:58:15.520
...by the ancient Inuit art
of throat singing.

700
00:58:15.737 --> 00:58:17.859
Throat singing?

701
00:58:28.415 --> 00:58:29.993
How long are we doing this?

702
00:58:30.209 --> 00:58:32.083
- Until you have an epiphany.
- Okay.

703
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.959
- Until you have an epiphany.
- Okay.

704
00:58:37.424 --> 00:58:38.455
What's an epiphany?

705
00:58:38.675 --> 00:58:41.711
Sudden realization of great truth.

706
00:58:41.928 --> 00:58:42.924
Okay.

707
00:58:57.484 --> 00:59:01.067
<i>♪ Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig ♪</i>

708
00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.648
<i>♪ Does whatever a Spider-Pig does ♪</i>

709
00:59:04.866 --> 00:59:05.981
<i>♪ Look out! ♪</i>

710
00:59:06.451 --> 00:59:10.401
<i>♪ He's a Spider-Pig ♪</i>

711
00:59:11.956 --> 00:59:14.079
Unless you have an epiphany...

712
00:59:14.292 --> 00:59:18.206
...you will spend the remainder
of your days alone.

713
00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:21.536
Epiphany, epiphany, epiphany.

714
00:59:22.258 --> 00:59:25.709
Bananas are an excellent source
of potassium.

715
00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.550
Americans will never embrace soccer?

716
00:59:32.684 --> 00:59:35.602
More than two shakes
and it's playing with yourself?

717
00:59:38.315 --> 00:59:40.437
Hey, what are you doing?

718
00:59:43.987 --> 00:59:48.779
Oh, do whatever you want to me.
I don't care about myself anymore.

719
00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.948
<i>Because...?</i>

720
00:59:53.579 --> 00:59:57.956
Because other people
are just as important as me.

721
00:59:58.333 --> 01:00:02.461
Without them, I'm nothing.

722
01:00:04.256 --> 01:00:07.624
In order to save myself...

723
01:00:07.842 --> 01:00:10.380
...I have to save Springfield!

724
01:00:10.595 --> 01:00:13.465
That's it! Isn't it?

725
01:00:26.068 --> 01:00:28.985
That was the most
incredible experience of my life.

726
01:00:29.196 --> 01:00:34.403
And now to find my family,
save my town and drop 10 pounds!

727
01:00:34.743 --> 01:00:36.486
Thank you, boob lady.

728
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:47.330
This is it, kids. Seattle.

729
01:00:47.547 --> 01:00:50.547
Russ Cargill! Do you think he saw us?

730
01:00:54.303 --> 01:00:55.845
Yes, I did.

731
01:01:00.767 --> 01:01:02.511
Run! Run!

732
01:01:03.103 --> 01:01:04.763
Run! Run!

733
01:01:05.272 --> 01:01:07.063
Run! Run!

734
01:01:07.774 --> 01:01:09.731
Jump! Jump!

735
01:01:09.943 --> 01:01:11.935
Land! Land!

736
01:01:12.403 --> 01:01:14.360
Rest! Rest!

737
01:01:15.073 --> 01:01:16.448
Run! Run!

738
01:01:19.118 --> 01:01:21.194
Now, I know we've had a rough day...

739
01:01:21.412 --> 01:01:24.366
...but I'm sure we can put all that
behind us and...

740
01:01:27.459 --> 01:01:29.119
That's my whipping arm!

741
01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:35.920
Why does everything I whip leave me?

742
01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:41.388
Must keep going. Must keep going.

743
01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:45.547
No, I can't. I can't keep going.

744
01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:47.844
Yes, you can.

745
01:01:48.062 --> 01:01:49.853
No, I can't!

746
01:01:50.064 --> 01:01:51.724
Oh, shut up!

747
01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:53.518
You shut up.

748
01:01:53.734 --> 01:01:55.561
No, you. No, you.

749
01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:58.565
No, you. Oh, real mature.

750
01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:01.069
How could you say that?

751
01:02:01.283 --> 01:02:03.275
Oh, what's the point?

752
01:02:03.493 --> 01:02:05.818
It's hopeless.

753
01:02:13.795 --> 01:02:17.377
Don't give up, Homer.
You are closer than you think.

754
01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:19.214
But which way do I go?

755
01:02:24.638 --> 01:02:26.429
Much obliged.

756
01:02:40.778 --> 01:02:42.901
Ten-hut!

757
01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.319
Lisa! Knock off that racket.

758
01:02:50.538 --> 01:02:51.533
Lisa!

759
01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:57.456
They captured my family.
What do I do? What do I do?

760
01:03:03.675 --> 01:03:06.462
There's something strange
about that "sop" sign.

761
01:03:24.611 --> 01:03:26.734
- Did you hear something?
- Probably just a moth.

762
01:03:26.947 --> 01:03:28.358
I hope it's okay.

763
01:03:52.638 --> 01:03:56.089
Look, we can't keep stopping at
every "sop," "yeld" or "one vay" sign.

764
01:03:56.308 --> 01:03:57.506
Just move on.

765
01:04:03.648 --> 01:04:05.308
Let us out! Let us out!

766
01:04:05.525 --> 01:04:07.683
Stop that.
You'll scratch your shackles.

767
01:04:07.902 --> 01:04:09.942
I hope I do.

768
01:04:16.243 --> 01:04:19.446
Oh, way to go, Bart.

769
01:04:19.663 --> 01:04:21.039
You stink.

770
01:04:21.248 --> 01:04:24.996
No, you stink.

771
01:04:40.266 --> 01:04:42.009
Springfield.

772
01:04:42.351 --> 01:04:44.676
I can't believe it,
but it got even crappier.

773
01:04:49.191 --> 01:04:50.566
Oh, man.

774
01:05:00.285 --> 01:05:01.364
Oh, hi, Midge.

775
01:05:01.578 --> 01:05:03.654
Moe, what happened?

776
01:05:03.872 --> 01:05:08.332
With the town sealed off from the rest of
the world, things got a little nutty here.

777
01:05:08.543 --> 01:05:09.918
Why are you dressed like that?

778
01:05:10.128 --> 01:05:14.540
Well, I don't like to brag,
but I am now the emperor of Springfield.

779
01:05:14.757 --> 01:05:16.085
No, you're not!

780
01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.589
Yes, I am!

781
01:05:19.803 --> 01:05:22.377
Okay. Hail, emperor.

782
01:05:22.598 --> 01:05:24.637
<i>Attention, Springfield.</i>

783
01:05:26.184 --> 01:05:30.312
<i>Your government realized that putting you
inside this dome was a terrible mistake.</i>

784
01:05:30.522 --> 01:05:33.855
<i>Therefore, we're commencing with
Operation Soaring Eagle.</i>

785
01:05:35.568 --> 01:05:37.110
<i>Which involves killing you all.</i>

786
01:05:45.369 --> 01:05:49.319
<i>As I speak, we're lowering a small
but powerful bomb into your midst.</i>

787
01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:02.289
Despite everything, I miss your father.

788
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:04.170
Me too.

789
01:06:04.387 --> 01:06:07.056
His big, fat ass could shield us all.

790
01:06:11.644 --> 01:06:12.640
Ten-hut!

791
01:06:14.188 --> 01:06:17.723
At ease. I'm General Marriott Suites...

792
01:06:17.942 --> 01:06:20.314
...and I have an urgent note
from the president.

793
01:06:20.527 --> 01:06:22.899
It says to release
this town immediately.

794
01:06:23.363 --> 01:06:24.692
Why is it written on a leaf?

795
01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:48.131
Perfect.

796
01:06:50.597 --> 01:06:55.555
Now Homer Simpson's gonna show
he has cojones!

797
01:07:13.077 --> 01:07:15.034
Mom, I've gotta go find Colin.

798
01:07:15.246 --> 01:07:19.492
Not now, sweetie.
Doomsday is family time.

799
01:07:24.421 --> 01:07:28.964
Hey. If one of us distracts Cargill,
the rest of us can climb up that thing.

800
01:07:29.175 --> 01:07:32.959
Who'd be dumb enough to stay behind
while we escape with our lives?

801
01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.838
My time to shine.

802
01:07:36.391 --> 01:07:39.594
Hey, Mr. Big TV Man, lookie here!

803
01:07:40.019 --> 01:07:41.513
<i>What do you want?</i>

804
01:07:42.772 --> 01:07:45.891
Look what I can do with my thumb.

805
01:07:46.775 --> 01:07:48.684
You wanna know how I do it?

806
01:07:48.902 --> 01:07:51.191
<i>Four generations of inbreeding?</i>

807
01:08:06.794 --> 01:08:08.502
I can smell fresh air.

808
01:08:09.463 --> 01:08:11.503
I can hear birds.

809
01:08:11.716 --> 01:08:14.004
I taste freedom.

810
01:08:14.218 --> 01:08:16.341
Excuse me!
Watch out! Coming through!

811
01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:25.728
<i>I was tricked by an idiot.</i>

812
01:08:25.937 --> 01:08:31.560
Hey, I know how you feel.
I was beat in tic-tac-toe by a chicken.

813
01:08:31.776 --> 01:08:33.235
<i>Goodbye.</i>

814
01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:37.358
Homer do good?

815
01:08:37.782 --> 01:08:42.693
Actually, you doomed us all. Again.
Nice knowing you, Homer.

816
01:08:42.912 --> 01:08:44.287
But I...

817
01:08:47.374 --> 01:08:49.995
I can't do anything right.

818
01:08:53.005 --> 01:08:55.163
Get out of here!

819
01:09:02.472 --> 01:09:06.421
I've spent my entire life doing nothing
but collecting comic books.

820
01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:09.312
And now there's only time to say:

821
01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.347
Life well spent!

822
01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:21.068
Okay, boys. When you meet Jesus,
be sure to call him Mr. Christ.

823
01:09:21.281 --> 01:09:23.072
Will Buddha be there too?

824
01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:24.362
No.

825
01:09:24.701 --> 01:09:26.492
- Hey, Flanders.
- Bart.

826
01:09:26.786 --> 01:09:30.736
How good to see you.
And how terrible you're here.

827
01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.665
Thanks.

828
01:09:32.875 --> 01:09:37.336
Listen. I was just wondering if...

829
01:09:37.547 --> 01:09:39.669
...before I died...

830
01:09:39.882 --> 01:09:43.749
...I could pretend I had a father who...

831
01:09:43.969 --> 01:09:45.380
...cared for me.

832
01:09:46.722 --> 01:09:48.264
Come here, son.

833
01:09:48.473 --> 01:09:51.759
There's always room for one more
in the Flanders clan.

834
01:09:56.481 --> 01:09:59.850
Come on, bomb-disarming robot.
You're our last hope.

835
01:10:00.068 --> 01:10:04.564
<i>Red wire. Blue wire.
Black is usually the ground.</i>

836
01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.448
<i>So much pressure.</i>

837
01:10:08.618 --> 01:10:09.862
<i>Pressure!</i>

838
01:10:13.872 --> 01:10:16.992
He'd been talking about it,
but I didn't take him seriously.

839
01:10:23.089 --> 01:10:24.252
Marge.

840
01:10:24.466 --> 01:10:26.707
Marge! Marge!

841
01:10:27.886 --> 01:10:29.843
Oh, no, the "epipha-tree"!

842
01:10:30.054 --> 01:10:33.838
Hey, I tried my best.
What am I supposed to do?

843
01:10:35.101 --> 01:10:38.351
But how am I
supposed to get up there?

844
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.069
Here. Buy yourself something nice.

845
01:10:50.699 --> 01:10:53.404
Homer? What the hell
are you doing now?

846
01:10:53.618 --> 01:10:55.445
Risking my life to save people I hate...

847
01:10:55.662 --> 01:10:58.283
...for reasons I don't quite understand.
Gotta go!

848
01:10:59.749 --> 01:11:01.742
But first, one stop.

849
01:11:08.716 --> 01:11:11.337
Bart? Son?

850
01:11:11.552 --> 01:11:13.544
You think you could find it
in your heart...

851
01:11:13.762 --> 01:11:16.384
...to give your foolish old man
one more chance?

852
01:11:16.765 --> 01:11:19.552
Oh, I don't know.

853
01:11:19.768 --> 01:11:22.306
It seems to me, son,
that your father's saying that...

854
01:11:22.521 --> 01:11:25.770
...he wants to spend
his last minute with you.

855
01:11:28.485 --> 01:11:30.394
No. I can't do it.

856
01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:34.770
I want a father who's the same
in the morning as he is at night.

857
01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:36.271
What's that word?

858
01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:37.772
- Consistency.
- Consistency.

859
01:11:37.993 --> 01:11:39.452
Thanks, losers.

860
01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:40.776
Sorry, Homer.

861
01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:44.620
I'll let you hold the bomb.

862
01:11:45.959 --> 01:11:47.453
The man knows me.

863
01:11:51.923 --> 01:11:54.248
I wish Homer was my father.

864
01:11:54.467 --> 01:11:57.421
And I wish you didn't have
the devil's curly hair.

865
01:12:05.519 --> 01:12:10.477
I've been taking your crap all my life!

866
01:12:13.152 --> 01:12:16.651
This feels good. No wonder you do it.

867
01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.903
Okay, you've only got one shot
to throw that bomb through the hole.

868
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.445
Dad, in case I miss...

869
01:12:26.664 --> 01:12:29.334
...I'm sorry I said I wished
you weren't my father.

870
01:12:29.542 --> 01:12:32.709
I don't blame you, son.
I wasn't much of a father.

871
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.589
Maybe it starts with the way
my dad raised me.

872
01:12:35.798 --> 01:12:40.175
Yes. It's clear to me. It's just been
one long, unbroken cycle of...

873
01:12:40.386 --> 01:12:43.055
Somebody throw the goddamn bomb!

874
01:13:05.284 --> 01:13:07.277
What? What's going on?

875
01:13:31.809 --> 01:13:33.090
We did it, boy!

876
01:13:33.477 --> 01:13:34.972
Dad?

877
01:14:25.193 --> 01:14:27.980
It's amazing no one was hurt.

878
01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.650
Bye, everybody.

879
01:14:33.993 --> 01:14:37.278
Now, that was
a great father-son activity.

880
01:14:37.496 --> 01:14:39.785
Hello, Homer.

881
01:14:40.624 --> 01:14:44.324
So we meet at last, whoever you are.

882
01:14:44.544 --> 01:14:47.581
There's two things they don't teach you
at Harvard Business School.

883
01:14:47.798 --> 01:14:50.502
How to cope with defeat,
and how to handle a shotgun.

884
01:14:50.717 --> 01:14:53.208
I'm going to do both right now.

885
01:14:53.428 --> 01:14:55.586
Wait! If you kill my dad...

886
01:14:55.805 --> 01:14:58.047
...you'll never know
where the treasure is buried.

887
01:14:58.266 --> 01:14:59.297
What treasure?

888
01:15:00.768 --> 01:15:02.346
The Treasure of Imawiener.

889
01:15:02.561 --> 01:15:03.641
I'm a wiener?

890
01:15:05.564 --> 01:15:06.560
Classic.

891
01:15:06.774 --> 01:15:08.932
Well, always leave them laughing.

892
01:15:09.151 --> 01:15:10.562
Goodbye, sir.

893
01:15:17.784 --> 01:15:22.529
Maggie! What a great little accident
you turned out to be.

894
01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.287
Colin? Colin!

895
01:15:28.753 --> 01:15:31.540
Lisa? Colin's dead.

896
01:15:33.132 --> 01:15:35.255
But his last words were:

897
01:15:35.468 --> 01:15:41.091
"Milhouse, take care of Lisa.
Hold her hand."

898
01:15:43.892 --> 01:15:46.348
I got her all warmed up for you.

899
01:15:46.561 --> 01:15:48.850
Colin. Hi.

900
01:15:49.064 --> 01:15:51.187
- Hey, you wanna go...?
- Clean up the lake?

901
01:15:51.399 --> 01:15:54.068
Well, I was gonna say
get some ice cream, but okay.

902
01:15:55.028 --> 01:15:56.819
I like ice cream.

903
01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.200
Kind of sweaty. Sorry.

904
01:16:20.051 --> 01:16:22.624
Boy! You survived! How?

905
01:16:22.846 --> 01:16:24.672
I did things no dog should do.

906
01:16:24.889 --> 01:16:26.846
They will haunt me forever.

907
01:16:27.308 --> 01:16:28.471
I love you too.

908
01:16:44.408 --> 01:16:47.029
Best kiss of my life.

909
01:16:47.244 --> 01:16:49.995
Best kiss of your life so far.

910
01:17:08.555 --> 01:17:09.753
Steady.

911
01:17:10.641 --> 01:17:12.966
Steady.

912
01:17:14.269 --> 01:17:16.427
Steady.

913
01:17:16.646 --> 01:17:18.057
Dad?

914
01:17:18.982 --> 01:17:20.725
Thanks, boy.

915
01:17:20.942 --> 01:17:23.397
Steady.

916
01:18:10.239 --> 01:18:13.156
They've taken everything, sir.

917
01:18:15.702 --> 01:18:19.450
Smithers, I don't believe in suicide...

918
01:18:19.664 --> 01:18:23.199
...but if you'd like to try it,
it might cheer me up to watch.

919
01:18:57.825 --> 01:18:59.070
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

920
01:18:59.285 --> 01:19:02.155
If you see me in person,
please, leave me be.

Come on, Dad, let's go. I've been holding
it since they put the dome over the town.

930
01:20:18.526 --> 01:20:21.610
You can wait. A lot of people
worked really hard on this film...

931
01:20:21.821 --> 01:20:25.949
...and all they ask is for you
to memorize their names.

932
01:20:26.158 --> 01:20:28.566
Well, I wanna make sure
no animals were harmed...

933
01:20:28.786 --> 01:20:31.740
...during the filming of this movie.

934
01:20:35.501 --> 01:20:36.496
Okay.

935
01:20:37.377 --> 01:20:39.666
Floor popcorn.

936
01:20:41.756 --> 01:20:44.591
Wait, wait, wait! It looks like
Maggie has something to say.

937
01:20:44.801 --> 01:20:47.588
Oh, my God. Her first word.

938
01:20:48.346 --> 01:20:50.255

950

Four years of film school for this?
