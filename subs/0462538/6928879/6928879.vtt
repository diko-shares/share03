be a nervous Pervis or anything,

187
00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:39.936

make your boy a parapleg-erino?

188
00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:43.064
-Shut up, Flanders.
-Yeah, shut up, Flanders.

189
00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:44.607
Well said, boy.

190
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.858
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

191
00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.277
Steady... steady...

192
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.904

Sorry to bother you on a Sunday,

197
00:08:57.578 --> 00:08:59.997
but I'm sure you're
as worried about the pollution

198
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:03.000
-in Lake Springfield as I am...
-(door slams)

199
00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:07.964
(knocking)

200
00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:11.259
Lake Springfield has higher
levels of mercury than even...

201
00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:13.010
(door slams)

202
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:22.478
Why, it's the little
girl who saved my cat.

203
00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.355
-Lake Springfield...
-(door slams)

204
00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:26.315

Oh...

210
00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:40.371
You can canvass me
as long as you want.

211
00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:42.873
Milhouse, you don't care
about the environment.

212
00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:45.459
Hey! I am very passionate
about the planet!

213
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.295
Say global warming
is a myth!

214
00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:49.547
It's a myth!
Further study is needed!

215
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.840
(grunts)

216
00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:53.551
That's for selling out
your beliefs!

00:09:57.513 --> 00:10:00.308
-Dream coming true.

219
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.685

a leaky faucet can waste over...

220
00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.687
-(door slams)
-2,000 gallons a year.

221
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.188
And turning off your lights
can save...

222
00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.607
Enough energy
to power Pittsburgh.

223
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.234
And if we just kept our
thermostats at 68 in the winter...

224
00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:13.321
We'd be free from our dependency
on foreign oil in 17 years!

225
00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:14.989
-I'm Colin.
-(gasps softly)

226
00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:16.824
I haven't seen you at school.

227
00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:18.909
Just moved from Ireland.
My dad's a musician.

228
00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:20.703
-Is he...
-He's not Bono.

229
00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:23.247
I just thought because you're
Irish and you care about...

230
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.332
He's not Bono.

231
00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:26.000
Do you play?

232
00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:28.210
Just piano, guitar,
trumpet, drums and bass.

233
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.087
(thinking):
<i>He's pure gold!</i>

234
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.757
<i>For once in your life, be cool.</i>

235
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.217
So, is your name as
pretty as your face?

236
00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:36.636
Oh!

237
00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:39.347
(screeches):
Ha! Ha!

238
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.890
You okay there?

239
00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.141

Twisted tail! A thousand eyes!
Trapped forever!

242
00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.774
Epa! Epa!

243
00:10:49.857 --> 00:10:52.360
"Epa." What
could that be?

244
00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:54.695
I believe it's the sound
the Green Lantern made

245
00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.365
when Sinestro threw him
into a vat of acid.

246
00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:59.700
Ee-pah!

247
00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:00.910
Yeah.

248
00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.037
Uh, thanks
for coming over.

249
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.247
Thanks for giving me
your pregnancy pants.

250
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.083
I've never known
comfort like this.

Oh! Aah!

255
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.178
Ow! Ee!

Aah! Aah!

259
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.770
All right, boy, time
for the ultimate dare.

How naked?

If that's true,

(gasps)

359
00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:53.327
Homer!

360
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.371
(quiet grunt)

361
00:15:55.454 --> 00:16:00.250
I believe what happened in church
was a warning about precisely this.

362
00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.503
Please, get rid
of that pig!

363
00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:04.213
Oh, you're gonna love him.

364
00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.382
Look-- he does
an impression of you.

365
00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.716
(squeals loudly)

366
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.218
(grunting)

367
00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:11.887
(laughing):
You nailed her.

368
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.014
He also does me.

369
00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:15.099
(belches)

370
00:16:15.182 --> 00:16:16.225
(laughing)

371
00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:17.977
You smiled! I'm off the hook!

372
00:16:22.439 --> 00:16:23.732
Ooh.

373
00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:26.527
(humming)

374
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.738
Oh, you have so many looks.

375
00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:33.075
(pig snorts)

376
00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.994
(sighs)

377
00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:40.541
(kissing)

378
00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.628
(vacuum whirring)

379
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.425
Hmm, so that's what snug is.

380
00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:51.343
HOMER (playfully):
Who's a good pig?

381
00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:52.636
(blowing raspberries)

382
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.180
Who's a good pig?

383
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.102
NED:
Rough day, huh, son?

384
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.605
You don't know what
rough is, sister.

385
00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:04.857
(chuckles)

386
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.191
Bart, you know,
whenever my boys

387
00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:08.819
bake up a batch of frownies,
I take them fishing.

388
00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:11.655
Does your dad
ever take you fishing?

389
00:17:13.907 --> 00:17:15.492
-(electrical buzzing)
-Dad!

390
00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:18.287
It's not fair to use a bug
zapper to catch the fish.

391
00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:20.164
If you love
fish like I do,

392
00:17:20.247 --> 00:17:22.166
you want them
to die with dignity.

393
00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:25.419
(loud zapping)

394
00:17:25.502 --> 00:17:27.463
(gurgling)

395
00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:29.381
I think I have a nibble.

396
00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:31.008
(screams)

397
00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:33.177
(electrical crackling,
screaming)

398
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.137
(screaming,
electrical crackling)

399
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.889
(electrical crackling,
screaming)

400
00:17:38.098 --> 00:17:40.601
I think fishing
might be more fun with you.

401
00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:41.852
Oh, great.

402
00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:43.854
Now, how 'bout
I fix you some cocoa?

403
00:17:43.937 --> 00:17:45.814
No way, cocoa's
for wusses.

404
00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.901
Well, sir, if you change your
mind, it's on the windowsill.

405
00:18:03.123 --> 00:18:04.208
(grunts)

406
00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.128
(slurping)

407
00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:10.756
Oh, my God.

408
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.426
Oh, wait. I didn't
tell you the best part.

409
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.719
He loves the environment.

410
00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:17.721
Oh, wait, I still didn't
tell you the best part.

411
00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:20.265
He's got an Irish brogue.

412
00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.976
No, no, wait, wait! I still
didn't tell you the best part!

413
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.520
He's not imaginary.

414
00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:27.356
Oh, honey, that's great.

415
00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:31.443
But the very best thing
is that he listens to you.

416
00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:34.613
Because nothing means more
than for a man to...

417
00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:37.324
How did the pig tracks
get on the ceiling?

418
00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:38.826
HOMER:
♪ Spider Pig ♪

419
00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:42.663
♪ Spider Pig, does whatever
a Spider Pig does ♪

420
00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:45.124
♪ Can he swing from a web? ♪

421
00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:47.417
♪ No, he can't, he's a pig ♪

422
00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:48.836
♪ Look out... ♪

423
00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:51.755
♪ He is a Spider Pig. ♪

424
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:54.007
(ducks quacking)

425
00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.178
Are we having fun yet?

426
00:18:58.262 --> 00:19:00.139
We are now.
You've got a bite.

427
00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:01.765
Whoa, mama!

428
00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:05.602
Oh, no, my good pole!

429
00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:07.271
(choking)

430
00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:11.608
Huh? You're not
strangling me.

431
00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:12.860
What the...?

432
00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:14.486
Why, strangling's
only good for...

433
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.446
Well, it's not really
good for anything.

434
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.699
I think the only time you
should lay hands on a boy

435
00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:21.160
is when you're giving him
a good old pat on the back.

436
00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:22.619
Hey, what the hell
are you...?

437
00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:27.040
Oh...

438
00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:28.250
One more time.

439
00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:37.926
(incoherent rambling,
meowing)

440
00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:43.432
-(bottles clinking)
-Honey, I'm home.

441
00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:44.516
(shrieks)

442
00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.853
(growls)

443
00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:50.272
(guitar playing sweetly)

444
00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:52.608
LISA: We are at the tipping
point, people.

445
00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:56.111
If we don't do
something now, uh...

446
00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.905
I'm sorry, I lost
my train of thought.

447
00:19:57.988 --> 00:19:59.781
Isn't he dreamy?

448
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.116
-Agreed.
-(gavel bangs)

449
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.826
Okay, so here's
the bottom line.

450
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.828
If we don't change
our ways right now,

451
00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:06.455
pollution in Lake
Springfield

452
00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:09.833
-will be at this level.
-(motor whirring)

453
00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:11.418
That's not so bad.

454
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:15.380
-No, the lift is stuck.
-(gears grinding)

455
00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:18.300
(whirring, grinding)

456
00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:19.468
(crashing)

457
00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.971
Am I getting through to anyone?

458
00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:23.972
Hell, yeah!

459
00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.682
We need a new one
of those things.

460
00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:28.185
All in favor of a new
scissor lift say aye.

461
00:20:28.268 --> 00:20:30.145
-ALL: Aye!
-No!

462
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:33.398
This lake is just
one piece of trash away

463
00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.359
from a toxic nightmare.

464
00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:37.861
But I knew you wouldn't listen,
so I took the liberty

465
00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:40.989
of pouring water from the lake
in all your drinking glasses.

466
00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.616
(spitting, groaning)

467
00:20:42.699 --> 00:20:44.910
MOE: This is why we
should hate kids.

468
00:20:44.993 --> 00:20:48.288
This is serious, people.
No more dumping in the lake.

469
00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.832
I hereby declare
a state of emergency.

470
00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:52.876
Code black.

471
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.794
(gasping)

472
00:20:53.877 --> 00:20:54.920
Black?

473
00:20:55.003 --> 00:20:57.506
That's the worst
color there is.

474
00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.216
No offense there, Carl.

475
00:20:59.299 --> 00:21:00.759
I get it all the time.

476
00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:04.263
(triumphant orchestration plays)

477
00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:13.397
(sizzling)

478
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.441
(machinery whirring)

479
00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:19.903
Uh, sorry, sorry.
No dumping in the lake.

480
00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:21.321
Fine.

481
00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:25.284
I will put my yard trimmings
in a car compactor.

482
00:21:26.576 --> 00:21:29.579
Uh... Chief, I think there
was a dead body in there.

483
00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.749
I thought that, too,
until he said "yard trimmings."

484
00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.210
You got to learn to listen, Lou.

485
00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:37.337
Let us now make sure
this barrier

486
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.423
is completely idiot proof.

487
00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:40.966
Cletus.

488
00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:42.050
Yessum?

489
00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.885
Try to dump something
in the lake.

490
00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:45.470
Okay.

491
00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.982
I can't.
I-I simply can't.

492
00:21:57.065 --> 00:21:58.900
-Brilliant.
-Very effective.

493
00:22:00.944 --> 00:22:03.071
(snorts)

494
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.199
(kissing)

495
00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:08.035
Ayayay!

496
00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:10.245
<i>Un burro amoroso!</i>

497
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.789
Don't get any ideas. Huh?

498
00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:14.875
(both laughing)

499
00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:20.756
Maybe we should kiss
just to break the tension.

500
00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.424
What's going on here?

501
00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:23.925
Uh, nothing,
nothing.

502
00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:26.803
I'm not sure that pig
should be in the house.

503
00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:28.472
And by the way,
what are you doing

504
00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:31.016
with his... leavings?

505
00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:32.100
Don't worry.

506
00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:35.020
I've devised a most
elegant solution.

507
00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:38.690
(groans):
Oh, it's leaking.

508
00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:40.067
It's not leaking,

509
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.402
it's overflowing.

510
00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:46.406
He filled up the whole
silo in just two days?

511
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:47.783
Well, I helped.

512
00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:48.784
Homer, stop.

513
00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:52.662
I know it's easy
for your mind to wander...

514
00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:55.248
(cymbals clicking)

515
00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:58.293
(muffled): I want you to
really concentrate on me.

516
00:23:01.129 --> 00:23:03.006
I can't escape
the feeling

517
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.468
that this is the crisis
Grandpa warned us about.

518
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:09.805
You have to dispose
of that waste properly.

519
00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:12.349
Okay, Marge, I will.

520
00:23:12.432 --> 00:23:14.476
You can take
Spider Pig with you.

521
00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:17.020
He's not Spider Pig anymore.
He's Harry Plopper.

522
00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:18.355
(snorts)

523
00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:27.447
(faint cell phone chiming)

524
00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:30.784
(grunts)

525
00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:32.786
Y'ello.

526
00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:34.329
Homer, you got
to get over here.

527
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:36.456
The health inspector just
shut down the doughnut store

528
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.166
and they're giving
out free doughnuts.

529
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.668
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

530
00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:41.336
I just got one thing
I got to do first.

531
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.172
Well, you better hurry!
They're going fast.

532
00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:45.757
(gunshot)

533
00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:47.884
Whoa, that was close.

534
00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:49.678
Oh!

535
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:51.388
(tires screeching)

536
00:23:59.813 --> 00:24:00.897
(grunts)

537
00:24:08.738 --> 00:24:10.699
(gurgling)

538
00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:20.584
(gurgling)

539
00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:23.003
(fizzing)

540
00:24:23.086 --> 00:24:24.588
Uh-oh.

541
00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:31.595
(deep voice):
Evil!

542
00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:34.639
Drive, drive, drive!

543
00:24:34.723 --> 00:24:36.558
-(snorting)
-Oh, right.

544
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:40.687
(tires screeching)

545
00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.066
(chittering)

546
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.110
(snarling)

547
00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:49.779
(bubbling)

548
00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:54.451
(growling)

549
00:24:55.535 --> 00:24:56.953
(giggles)

550
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.045
Look at that.

551
00:25:05.128 --> 00:25:07.172
You can see the four states
that border Springfield.

552
00:25:07.255 --> 00:25:11.092
Ohio, Nevada,
Maine and Kentucky.

553
00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:12.511
Oh, yeah.

554
00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:15.096
And if you look real close,
you can almost...

555
00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.181
(shrieks)

556
00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:21.269
Well...
this certainly seems odd,

557
00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:25.148
but who am I to question
the work of the Almighty?

558
00:25:25.232 --> 00:25:27.776
Oh... we thank you, Lord,

559
00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:31.238
for this mighty fine
intelligent design.

560
00:25:31.321 --> 00:25:33.490
Good job.

561
00:25:33.573 --> 00:25:36.243
Jabbity-jabbity-jab-jab-jab.

562
00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:39.746
Hey, jab one more eye,
and it's a federal crime.

563
00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:42.624
-Who are you?
-Environmental Protection Agency.

564
00:25:50.882 --> 00:25:54.010
Russ Cargill, head of the E.P.A.,
here to see the president.

565
00:25:54.094 --> 00:25:55.387
(buzzing)

566
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.222
(rapid buzzing)

567
00:25:59.266 --> 00:26:00.809
Mr. President.

568
00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:03.478
Ja.<i></i>That is me.

569
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:07.315
Pollution in Springfield
has reached crisis levels.

570
00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:09.317
Oh... I hate this job.

571
00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:11.945
Everything's crisis this
and end of the world that.

572
00:26:12.028 --> 00:26:13.697
Nobody opens with a joke.

573
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.365
I miss Danny DeVito.

574
00:26:15.448 --> 00:26:16.741
You want a joke, huh?

575
00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:18.285
Stop me if you've
heard this one.

576
00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:20.161
-(growling)
-(gasps)

577
00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:23.164
Look at those angry
eyes and giant teeth.

578
00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:25.625
It's like Christmas
at the Kennedy compound.

579
00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:27.419
You know, sir,
when you made me

580
00:26:27.502 --> 00:26:29.713
head of the E.P.A.,
you were applauded

581
00:26:29.796 --> 00:26:32.507
for appointing one of the most
successful men in America

582
00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:34.926
to the least successful
agency in government.

583
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.012
And why did I take the job?

584
00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:39.639
'Cause I'm a rich man who
wanted to give something back.

585
00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:41.725
Not the money, but something.

586
00:26:41.808 --> 00:26:46.104
So here is our chance to kick
some ass for Mother Earth.

587
00:26:46.187 --> 00:26:47.147
I'm listening.

588
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.190
Well, I've narrowed
your choices down

589
00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.192
to five
unthinkable options.

590
00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:52.819
Each will
cause untold misery...

591
00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:54.654
I pick number three.

592
00:26:54.738 --> 00:26:56.489
You don't even want
to read them first?

593
00:26:56.573 --> 00:26:59.326
I was elected to lead,
not to read.

594
00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:00.368
Number three!

595
00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:03.913
(low rumbling)

596
00:27:08.668 --> 00:27:10.170
(inhaler whooshing)

597
00:27:10.253 --> 00:27:12.047
(choking)

598
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:14.341
(rumbling)

599
00:27:18.094 --> 00:27:20.430
(screaming)

600
00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:25.352
(rotors whirring)

601
00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:38.698
(cracking, rumbling)

602
00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:43.536
(gasping):
We're being sealed in a dome.

603
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.538
(yells)

604
00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:46.706
(thuds)
Whoa!

605
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.917
Oh, what do I do?
I don't know what to do.

606
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.919
If I stay I'm trapped,
if I leave I'm alone.

607
00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:52.796
Oh, God!
In, out, in, out...

608
00:27:52.879 --> 00:27:54.172
I never saw Venice.

609
00:27:55.548 --> 00:27:58.593
(helicopter blades whirring)

610
00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:01.262
(crashing)

611
00:28:05.725 --> 00:28:07.686
EPA! EPA!

612
00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:09.771
Trapped forever.

613
00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:11.856
It's all come true.

614
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.652
That crazy old man
in church was right.

615
00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:17.404
(suction popping)

616
00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:25.620
(screaming):
D'oh... ome!

617
00:28:29.165 --> 00:28:32.335
(indistinct murmuring)

618
00:28:32.419 --> 00:28:35.380
(sirens approaching)

619
00:28:35.463 --> 00:28:37.549
(gasping, shrieking)

620
00:28:39.926 --> 00:28:42.303
All right, men,
open fire.

621
00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:44.347
-(gunshots ricocheting)
-Ow!

622
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:46.307
Who's hurt?
Raise your hands.

623
00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:48.017
(groaning)

624
00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:49.310
Without the attitude.

625
00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:50.353
People, people.

626
00:28:50.437 --> 00:28:52.147
I have an important
announcement.

627
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.483
I have just perfected
an acid-firing superdrill

628
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.360
which can cut through anything.

629
00:28:57.444 --> 00:28:58.903
-That's cool.
-(crowd gasping)

630
00:28:58.987 --> 00:29:00.029
It's right there.

631
00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:02.741
Just outside...
of the dome.

632
00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:03.950
(crowd groaning)

633
00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:05.285
(banging)

634
00:29:05.368 --> 00:29:09.289
What ruthless madmen
could have done this to us?

635
00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:10.957
CARGILL:
The United States government.

636
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.500
(gasping, murmuring)

637
00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:13.877
(static hisses)

638
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.004
My name is Russ Cargill,
and I'm head of the E.P.A.

639
00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:17.338
(indistinct murmuring)

640
00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:18.506
The what?

641
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.008
Environmental Protection Agency.

642
00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:21.259
LENNY:
Come again?

643
00:29:21.342 --> 00:29:23.720
Look, I'm a man on a big TV.
Just listen.

644
00:29:23.803 --> 00:29:25.096
Springfield has become...

645
00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.639
MAN:
Whoo! Springfield!

646
00:29:26.723 --> 00:29:28.975
...the most polluted city
in the history of the planet.

647
00:29:29.058 --> 00:29:30.852
KRUSTY:
Drama queen!

648
00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:33.104
To prevent your poisons
from spreading,

649
00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:35.356
your government has sealed you
all within this dome.

650
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.858
(gasping)

651
00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:38.777
Believe me, it's the last thing
we wanted to do.

652
00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.403
I do own the company
that makes the dome,

653
00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:41.696
but that's beside the point.

654
00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.490
What, are you telling us
we're trapped like rats?

655
00:29:43.573 --> 00:29:45.575
No, rats can't
be trapped this easily.

656
00:29:45.658 --> 00:29:48.161
You're trapped like... carrots.

657
00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:52.248
Wait, wait.
We couldn't be more polluted.

658
00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:54.417
Everyone stopped
dumping in the lake.

659
00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:56.836
Apparently someone
didn't get the message.

660
00:29:58.463 --> 00:29:59.756
Act natural.

661
00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:00.715
(snorts)

662
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.050
Hey, buddy, sooner or later,

663
00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.427
people are going to come by
and discover this.

664
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:05.887
Don't worry about that.

665
00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.473
We found a way
to take you off the map.

666
00:30:10.016 --> 00:30:11.726
G.P.A. VOICE:
Coming up on your right...

667
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.229
(beep)
...nothing.

668
00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:17.232
This is Kent Brockman, reporting
to you on a crisis so serious

669
00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:19.359
it has its own name
and theme music.

670
00:30:19.442 --> 00:30:22.529
(dramatic theme playing)

671
00:30:22.612 --> 00:30:25.240
The dome has put an end
to life as we know it.

672
00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:27.617
The town is running low
on supplies of everything

673
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.245
from gasoline to Botox.

674
00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:31.871
Moment, please.

675
00:30:35.083 --> 00:30:37.377
Now, as always--
(chuckles)

676
00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.129
we end our news
on the lighter side.

677
00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:43.758
It's the time of year when the
swallows return to Springfield.

678
00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:44.884
(chirping)

679
00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:45.927
(thudding)

680
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.554
(screeching along glass)

681
00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:49.180
(meowing)

682
00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:52.100
(wind rustling trees)

683
00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:54.185
(MARGE sighs deeply)

684
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:59.357
I think the thing I miss most
is a simple summer breeze.

685
00:31:03.778 --> 00:31:04.612
(gasps)

686
00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:06.030
Maggie?

687
00:31:06.114 --> 00:31:08.116
(sucks pacifier)

688
00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.159
(on TV): We've got dome wax,
dome polish, dome freshener,

689
00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:11.619
all your dome needs
at Dome Depot,

690
00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:14.247
located at the intersection
of the 105 Freeway and the dome.

691
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.582
CHORUS:
♪ Dome Depot! ♪

692
00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:16.666
(bell dings)

693
00:31:16.749 --> 00:31:18.918
-Maggie got out! Maggie got out!
-Huh?

694
00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:23.131
Maggie was right there.

695
00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:25.341
Just outside the dome.

696
00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:27.635
Marge, she's right here.

697
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:28.970
Hmm...?

698
00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:30.847
This dome can
play tricks on you.

699
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.391
You just have to
keep calm and...

700
00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:34.475
Oh, my God!

701
00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.977
I'm out of the dome.

702
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.020
Fresh air!

703
00:31:37.103 --> 00:31:38.479
Freedom!

704
00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.106
(laughing hysterically)

705
00:31:40.189 --> 00:31:41.983
I'll write you.
Lead good lives.

706
00:31:43.026 --> 00:31:45.445
(HOMER groans)

707
00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:47.071
(MARGE sighs heavily)

708
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:55.788
(sucks pacifier)

709
00:31:55.872 --> 00:31:57.665
(dramatic news theme
plays on TV)

710
00:31:57.749 --> 00:31:59.834
Good evening,
this is Kent Brockman.

711
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:01.085
Efforts to find out

712
00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:02.962
whose selfish crime
against the environment

713
00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:05.340
caused our entrapment
have been fruitless...

714
00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:06.257
(chuckles)

715
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:07.425
...until moments ago.

716
00:32:07.508 --> 00:32:09.344
-(shrieks)
-A shocking discovery

717
00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:11.346
has been made
here at Lake Springfield.

718
00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:15.224
That could be anybody's
pig crap silo.

719
00:32:17.644 --> 00:32:18.603
(shrieks)

720
00:32:18.686 --> 00:32:20.521
(gasps):
Homer!

721
00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:22.941
It was you!

722
00:32:23.024 --> 00:32:25.818
You single-handedly
killed this town.

723
00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:28.237
I know. It's weird.

724
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:29.530
Just a reminder.

725
00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:32.075
This station does not endorse
vigilante justice.

726
00:32:32.158 --> 00:32:34.702
Unless it gets results--
which it will.

727
00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:36.329
(buzzer sounding)

728
00:32:36.412 --> 00:32:40.583
You didn't listen to me
after I warned you!

729
00:32:40.667 --> 00:32:44.045
Don't worry, nobody watches
this stupid show.

730
00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:46.798
Hmm, what's that ominous glow
in the distance?

731
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:50.343
(clamoring)

732
00:32:50.426 --> 00:32:52.178
MOB (chanting):
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

733
00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:56.891
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

734
00:33:01.104 --> 00:33:04.732
Marge, look, those idiots
don't even know where we live.

735
00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:07.860
Kill! Kill! Kill!

736
00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:08.861
D'oh!

737
00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:10.863
(chanting):
We want Homer!

738
00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:12.031
We want Homer!

739
00:33:12.115 --> 00:33:15.034
You monster! You monster!

740
00:33:15.118 --> 00:33:16.661
Uh, did you see the news?

741
00:33:16.744 --> 00:33:18.871
Honey, come on, we
have bigger problems.

742
00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:21.290
But I'm so angry.

743
00:33:21.374 --> 00:33:22.458
You're a woman.

744
00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:24.877
You can hold
on to it forever.

745
00:33:24.961 --> 00:33:26.045
(sniffles)

746
00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:27.255
Okay.

747
00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:28.881
(chanting continues)

748
00:33:28.965 --> 00:33:32.260
Homer, you have to go out there,
face that mob

749
00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:34.929
and apologize for what you did.

750
00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:37.306
I would, but I'm afraid
if I open the door,

751
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.599
they'll take all of you.

752
00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:40.601
CARL: No, we won't!
We just want Homer!

753
00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:43.104
Well, maybe not you,
but they'll kill Grandpa.

754
00:33:43.187 --> 00:33:44.981
GRANDPA:
I'm part of the mob!

755
00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:49.569
Teeny, take out the baby!

756
00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:50.653
(screeches)

757
00:33:54.657 --> 00:33:56.075
(squealing)

758
00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:59.746
(clamoring)

759
00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:01.831
(sweet, romantic theme
playing)

760
00:34:01.914 --> 00:34:02.790
(gasps)

761
00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:04.959
Here, let me get
that for you.

762
00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:08.171
(disappointed sigh)

763
00:34:09.422 --> 00:34:12.258
(rattling)

764
00:34:12.341 --> 00:34:14.260
Stay back, I got a chain saw!

765
00:34:14.343 --> 00:34:16.387
(imitates chain saw revving)

766
00:34:21.851 --> 00:34:23.728
(slowly, weakly making chain saw sounds)

767
00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:25.104
Uh-oh.

768
00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:26.189
(mob shouting)

769
00:34:26.272 --> 00:34:29.233
Bart! Crawl across, hurry!

770
00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:31.694
But if they see you trying to
help us, they'll kill you.

771
00:34:31.778 --> 00:34:34.530
Oh, pshaw! I'm sure your father
would do the same for...

772
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.201
Point taken.
Now hustle your bustles.

773
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:43.623
Archers!

774
00:34:43.706 --> 00:34:46.459
I'm using a red arrow,
so I know who I kill.

775
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.545
(grunting)

776
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:51.380
No, Plopper.

777
00:34:51.464 --> 00:34:54.092
If you push that,
daddy will die.

778
00:34:55.843 --> 00:34:56.928
(all screaming)

779
00:34:57.011 --> 00:34:58.679
(grunting)

780
00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:01.516
Hey, my luck's beginning
to turn.

781
00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:07.772
Wait, there's something
I have to get.

782
00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:16.072
(gasps):
Ooh!

783
00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.575
(grunts)

784
00:35:24.747 --> 00:35:26.374
What'd you get?

785
00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:28.084
Our wedding video.

786
00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:29.335
We have a wedding video?

787
00:35:29.418 --> 00:35:30.586
KRUSTY:
Torch his gas tank!

788
00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:35.591
We lost 'em!

789
00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:36.759
Yahoo!

790
00:35:36.843 --> 00:35:38.553
(laughing)

791
00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.191
BART:
Ooh! Up here!

792
00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:55.278
Get 'em! Get 'em!

793
00:35:58.948 --> 00:36:00.783
HOMER:
Uh, little help?

794
00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:05.580
(HOMER howls)

795
00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:11.294
You know, the word "apology" is
tossed around a lot these days,

796
00:36:11.377 --> 00:36:13.629
but when it comes
from in here...

797
00:36:13.713 --> 00:36:15.423
D'oh!

798
00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:21.470
(HOMER screams)

799
00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:28.394
Mom, what are
we going to do!?

800
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.690
Maggie, not now.

801
00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:35.568
We'll play later.

802
00:36:42.658 --> 00:36:43.576
(gasps)

803
00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:45.244
The sinkhole.

804
00:36:45.328 --> 00:36:46.537
Follow me, kids.

805
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:47.872
BART:
Geronimo!

806
00:36:47.955 --> 00:36:48.956
LISA:
Sacagawea!

807
00:36:54.212 --> 00:36:56.005
So long, losers.

808
00:36:58.007 --> 00:36:59.634
(thud)

809
00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:01.719
Uh-oh.

810
00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:04.680
The top of his head
is still showing.

811
00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:06.390
Claw at it!

812
00:37:06.474 --> 00:37:09.143
(HOMER shrieking)

813
00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:10.895
NELSON:
Ha-ha!

814
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.694
(crowd exclaiming)

815
00:37:18.778 --> 00:37:21.197
(car alarm wailing)

816
00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.616
(deep rumbling)

817
00:37:26.452 --> 00:37:27.620
(crowd screaming)

818
00:37:31.874 --> 00:37:34.710
(clock chiming)

819
00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:38.464
(cuckoos)

820
00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:43.261
Well, they're
China's problem now.

821
00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:52.561
(knocking)

822
00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.273
Colin!

823
00:37:58.484 --> 00:38:01.529
(no audio)

824
00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:04.240
I can't hear you!

825
00:38:05.908 --> 00:38:07.785
(marker squeaking)

826
00:38:09.578 --> 00:38:10.830
Oh!

827
00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:20.589
♪ Da, da-da, da-da, da, da... ♪

828
00:38:23.884 --> 00:38:25.886
I never thought my life

829
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.432
would have an absolutely
perfect moment, but this...

830
00:38:29.515 --> 00:38:32.393
(singsongy): Lisa's got a boyfriend
that she'll never see again!

831
00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:33.561
(grunts)

832
00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:34.895
Perfect.

833
00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.689
(sirens wailing)

834
00:38:41.777 --> 00:38:43.237
(tires screeching)

835
00:38:45.614 --> 00:38:47.366
What do we do?

836
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.035
Now we run.

837
00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:55.541
I'm afraid we lost them, sir.

838
00:38:55.624 --> 00:38:57.001
Damn it.

839
00:38:57.084 --> 00:38:59.920
Well, then you find them and
you get them back in the dome.

840
00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:01.756
And to make sure
nobody else gets out,

841
00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:04.800
I want roving death squads
around the perimeter 24/7.

842
00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:07.928
I want 10,000 tough guys,
and I want 10,000 soft guys

843
00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:09.430
to make the tough guys
look tougher.

844
00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:10.890
And here's how I want them
arranged:

845
00:39:10.973 --> 00:39:13.434
Tough, tough, soft, tough, soft,

846
00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:17.271
soft, tough, tough,
soft, soft, tough, soft.

847
00:39:18.606 --> 00:39:21.776
Sir, I'm afraid you've
gone mad with power.

848
00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:24.153
Of course I have. Did you ever try
going mad without power?

849
00:39:24.236 --> 00:39:25.946
It's boring.
No one listens to you.

850
00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:37.625
Whew!

851
00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:38.959
(siren wails)

852
00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:39.877
(gasps)

853
00:39:45.758 --> 00:39:47.468
(groaning passionately,
smooching)

854
00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:49.637
Oh...!

855
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.680
(sucks pacifier)

856
00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.267
(helicopter blades whirring)

857
00:39:55.351 --> 00:39:57.311
Bart, are you drinking whiskey?

858
00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:58.396
I'm troubled.

859
00:39:58.479 --> 00:39:59.313
Bart!

860
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:00.856
I promise I'll stop tomorrow.

861
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.526
You'll stop right now.

862
00:40:07.655 --> 00:40:09.198
You come back here,
little man.

863
00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:12.034
(groans)

864
00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:13.702
(drunkenly):
I miss Flanders.

865
00:40:13.786 --> 00:40:16.622
There, I said it.

866
00:40:16.705 --> 00:40:17.957
Where's your father?

867
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.291
He went out.

868
00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:21.794
Let's quickly rebuild
our lives while he's gone.

869
00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:23.546
HOMER (in distance):
Hey, guys...?

870
00:40:23.629 --> 00:40:26.590
What's the secret knock again?

871
00:40:29.135 --> 00:40:31.846
Look, I know
I screwed up.

872
00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:32.888
This is big.

873
00:40:32.972 --> 00:40:34.306
It's huge!

874
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:35.516
We're homeless!

875
00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:37.768
Our friends
want to kill us.

876
00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:40.396
Before we can even stay
in the same room with you,

877
00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:43.065
I need to know what was
going through your mind

878
00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:45.568
when you didn't
listen to me

879
00:40:45.651 --> 00:40:48.320
and dumped that silo
in the lake.

880
00:40:48.404 --> 00:40:50.239
-(clueless whimper)
-Homer!

881
00:40:50.322 --> 00:40:52.324
I don't know
what to tell you, Marge.

882
00:40:52.408 --> 00:40:54.326
I don't think about things.

883
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:56.036
I respect people who do,

884
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.831
but I just try
to make the days not hurt

885
00:40:58.914 --> 00:41:02.585
until I get to crawl in
next to you again.

886
00:41:02.668 --> 00:41:04.545
(sweetly): Oh...

887
00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:06.547
(sternly):
I mean, oh.

888
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.382
Look, I'm really sorry.

889
00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:11.385
But I'm more than just sorry.

890
00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:12.928
I'm prepared with a solution.

891
00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:16.182
I've always been afraid
I'd screw up our lives so badly

892
00:41:16.265 --> 00:41:17.725
that we'd need a backup plan.

893
00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:22.646
And that plan is right here.
(chuckles)

894
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.983
No...

895
00:41:26.066 --> 00:41:27.234
Nope.

896
00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:28.319
Bingo.

897
00:41:31.947 --> 00:41:33.282
Bear with me.

900
00:41:38.787 --> 00:41:40.039
Alaska?!

901
00:41:40.122 --> 00:41:41.373
Alaska--

902
00:41:41.457 --> 00:41:44.210
a place where you can't be
too fat or too drunk.

903
00:41:44.293 --> 00:41:45.920
Where no one says things like:

904
00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:49.673
"Let's see your high school
equivalency certificate."

905
00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:52.009
Oh, I don't know, Homie.

906
00:41:52.092 --> 00:41:54.428
Oh, I'm not saying it right.

907
00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:58.599
Look, the thing is, I can't
start a new life alone.

908
00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:01.519
And I've really come
to like you guys.

909
00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.981
I just don't see it.

910
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.820
Marge, in every marriage,

911
00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:16.116
you get one chance to say:
"I need you to do this with me."

912
00:42:18.494 --> 00:42:22.081
And there's only one answer
when somebody says that.

913
00:42:27.419 --> 00:42:28.879
Okay, Homie.

914
00:42:28.963 --> 00:42:31.006
I'm with you.

915
00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.716
Thank you, my sweetheart.

916
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.009
BART:
Mom?

917
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:35.135
Yes, honey?

918
00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.555
You just bought
another load of crap

919
00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:40.808
from the world's fattest
fertilizer salesman.

920
00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:43.352
You'll pay for ruining
this golden family moment!

921
00:42:43.435 --> 00:42:44.728
Homer!

922
00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:48.232
How are we supposed to get
to Alaska without any money?

923
00:42:48.315 --> 00:42:50.609
All right, Son, if you
don't believe in me,

924
00:42:50.693 --> 00:42:52.861
believe in America.

925
00:42:52.945 --> 00:42:56.448
America, where any man
can make quick money

926
00:42:56.532 --> 00:42:59.034
with no questions asked.

927
00:43:02.288 --> 00:43:04.540
Step right up
and win my truck.

928
00:43:04.623 --> 00:43:07.751
All you have to do is conquer
the Ball of Death.

929
00:43:07.835 --> 00:43:09.670
-What's the catch?
-No catch--

930
00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:13.549
just ride the motorcycle
all the way around just one time.

931
00:43:13.632 --> 00:43:15.843
Three tries for $10.

932
00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:17.595
Marge, how much money
do we have?

933
00:43:17.678 --> 00:43:19.388
-Ten dollars.
-Whoo-hoo!

934
00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:23.350
That counts as a try.

935
00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:26.312
(engine revving)

936
00:43:26.395 --> 00:43:27.521
Ow!

937
00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:28.522
That's two.

938
00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:29.982
(engine revs)

939
00:43:30.065 --> 00:43:31.525
Ow!

940
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:32.860
And that's three.

941
00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.278
Tell you what
I'm going to do--

942
00:43:34.361 --> 00:43:35.946
just 'cause I like
seeing you hurt yourself:

943
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:37.489
I'll give you one
on the house.

944
00:43:37.573 --> 00:43:39.533
You're the best.

945
00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:41.327
Dad, when you get
to the top,

946
00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:43.412
don't slow down, speed up!

947
00:43:43.495 --> 00:43:45.164
But that's when
it's the scariest!

948
00:43:45.247 --> 00:43:46.582
Just do it!

949
00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:54.715
Ooh! Oh...!

950
00:43:56.467 --> 00:43:58.052
Whoo-hoo!

951
00:43:58.135 --> 00:43:59.720

953
00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:03.557
Yea, Dad!

954
00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:12.691
I'll take that truck now.

955
00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:17.029
Oh, man.

956
00:44:17.112 --> 00:44:18.697
My wives are going to kill me.

power failures which...

960

Okay, very funny.

961
00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.721
Now, I'm going to turn
the lights off again.

962
00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:44.098
When they come back on,

963
00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:46.600
I want all my booze
back the way it was.

964
00:44:50.771 --> 00:44:51.939
Yeah, okay.

965
00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:53.148
Okay.

966
00:45:00.572 --> 00:45:02.408
I'm very proud
of you, Bart.

967
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:04.493
Over 24 hours sober.

968
00:45:04.576 --> 00:45:05.703
You are, aren't you?

969
00:45:05.786 --> 00:45:06.995
I'll prove it.

971
00:45:12.835 --> 00:45:14.628
Look, we're giving your father
another chance,

972
00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:16.839
and we owe it to him to...
(gasps)

973
00:45:16.922 --> 00:45:18.674
Oh, my God.

974
00:45:18.757 --> 00:45:19.675
Can I help you?

975
00:45:19.758 --> 00:45:23.721
Uh... uh, we need diapers.

976
00:45:23.804 --> 00:45:24.972
Okay...

977
00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:26.515
No, no, we don't.
We don't.

979
00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:28.642
Right.

980
00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:30.060
No, no, no,
we don't.

981
00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:31.311

Just give us beef jerky.

985
00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:37.401
Lots and lots of beef jerky.

986
00:45:37.484 --> 00:45:38.736
That's right;
that's what we need.

987

I have two buttons
behind this desk.

One will supply
your town with power,

the other

to fry tomorrow, but now we can't.

Look, all our reasons
mean nothing.

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:40.579
(trumpeting)

1079
00:50:40.662 --> 00:50:42.831
(cracking)

1080
00:50:42.914 --> 00:50:44.416
You know what that is, sir?

1081
00:50:44.499 --> 00:50:46.084
-A crack?
-Exactly.

1082
00:50:46.168 --> 00:50:47.377
First, let me state the problem.

1083
00:50:47.461 --> 00:50:48.920
People got out of
the dome before,

1084
00:50:49.004 --> 00:50:50.505
they're going
to get out again.

1085
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:52.799
And when they do, there's going
to be hearings, investigations.

1086
00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.134
(speaking German)

1087
00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:56.511
I'll have to go back
to making family comedies.

1088
00:50:56.595 --> 00:50:58.388
(sighs)

1089
00:50:58.472 --> 00:51:00.390
Don't worry, I have
a solution for you, sir.

1090
00:51:00.474 --> 00:51:03.602
In fact, I have
five solutions.

1091
00:51:03.685 --> 00:51:06.188
You don't even have to read them.
You'll have deniability.

1092
00:51:06.271 --> 00:51:09.149
I'll take care of everything.
You know nothing.

1093
00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:11.026
No. I need to know
what I'm approving.

1094
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:12.611
Absolutely.

1095
00:51:12.694 --> 00:51:15.280
But on the other hand,
knowing things is overrated.

1096
00:51:15.363 --> 00:51:17.449
Anyone can pick something
when they know what it is.

1097
00:51:17.532 --> 00:51:19.117
It takes real leadership

1098
00:51:19.201 --> 00:51:21.369
to pick something
you're clueless about.

1099
00:51:21.453 --> 00:51:23.663
Okay, I pick three.

1100
00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:24.623
-Try again.
-One.

1101
00:51:24.706 --> 00:51:25.582
-Go higher.
-Five?

1102
00:51:25.665 --> 00:51:26.541
-Too high.
-Three?

1103
00:51:26.625 --> 00:51:27.626
-You already said three.
-Six?

1104
00:51:27.709 --> 00:51:28.794
-There is no six.
-Two?

1105
00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:29.836
-Double it.
-Four!

1106
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.921
As you wish, sir.

1107
00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:43.391
(happy music playing on TV)

1108
00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:47.187
(on TV): Are you tired of
the same old Grand Canyon?

1109
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.564
Here we are, kids--
the Grand Canyon.

1110
00:51:49.648 --> 00:51:51.566
It's so old and boring.

1111
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:52.984
I want a new one.

1112
00:51:53.068 --> 00:51:54.319
Now!

1113
00:51:54.402 --> 00:51:57.072
Hello. I'm Tom Hanks.

1114
00:51:57.155 --> 00:51:59.366
The U.S. government
has lost its credibility,

1115
00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:01.493
so it's borrowing
some of mine.

1116
00:52:01.576 --> 00:52:03.036
Tousle my hair, Mr. Hanks.

1117
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.496
Sure thing, son.

1118
00:52:04.579 --> 00:52:06.748
(laughs)

1119
00:52:06.832 --> 00:52:10.043
Now, I'm pleased to tell you all
about the new Grand Canyon.

1120
00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:11.461
Coming this weekend.

1121
00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:13.797
It's east of Shelbyville
and south of Capital City.

1122
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.882
That's where Springfield is!

1123
00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:18.218
It's nowhere near
where anything is or ever was.

1124
00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:19.678
This is Tom Hanks saying

1125
00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:21.555
if you're going to pick
a government to trust,

1126
00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:23.056
why not this one?

1127
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.599
Did you see that?

1128
00:52:24.683 --> 00:52:27.561
Yes, they're going
to destroy Springfield!

1129
00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:30.856
But we're going to stop them.
Homie, get your clothes on.

1130
00:52:30.939 --> 00:52:32.482
Homie?

1131
00:52:32.566 --> 00:52:34.943
I'm happy here.
Screw Springfield.

1132
00:52:35.026 --> 00:52:36.236
(gasping)

1133
00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:39.239
I can't believe
you'd say something so selfish.

1134
00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:42.659
Marge, those people chased us
with pitchforks and torches.

1135
00:52:42.742 --> 00:52:43.702
Torches!

1136
00:52:43.785 --> 00:52:45.412
At 4:00 in the afternoon!

1137
00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:46.538
It was 7:00 at night.

1138
00:52:46.621 --> 00:52:48.415
It was during
<i>Access Hollywood.</i>

1139
00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:50.458
Which is on at 4:00 and 7:00.

1140
00:52:50.542 --> 00:52:51.543
D'oh!

1141
00:52:51.626 --> 00:52:53.170
Dad, how can you
turn your back

1142
00:52:53.253 --> 00:52:54.588
on everyone who loved us?

1143
00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.173
Flanders helped us when
we were in trouble.

1144
00:52:56.256 --> 00:52:58.800
Who cares what Flanders did?
He's not your father.

1145
00:52:58.884 --> 00:52:59.968
I wish he was.

1146
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:02.429
You don't mean that.
You worship me.

1147
00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:03.430
Oh, yeah?

1148
00:53:03.513 --> 00:53:04.931
Look what I did to your picture.

1149
00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:06.600
-(gasping)
-Look at it!

1150
00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:08.518
Howdilly-doodilly.
Howdilly-doodilly.

1151
00:53:08.602 --> 00:53:10.353
-Howdilly-doodilly.
-Why, you little...

1152
00:53:10.437 --> 00:53:11.938
(grunting)

1153
00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.023
I'll strangle-angle you.

1154
00:53:13.106 --> 00:53:14.065
Diddily, diddily.

1155
00:53:14.149 --> 00:53:15.358
Bart, stop it!

1156
00:53:15.442 --> 00:53:16.902
Leave this to me.

1157
00:53:16.985 --> 00:53:20.238
Homer...

1158
00:53:20.322 --> 00:53:24.075
in every marriage you
get one chance to say

1159
00:53:24.159 --> 00:53:27.412
I need you to do this with me.

1160
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:32.584
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1161
00:53:32.667 --> 00:53:33.960
Homer Simpson!

1162
00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.712
We're saving Springfield!

1163
00:53:35.795 --> 00:53:37.130
Listen to me, all of you.

1164
00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:39.841
We are staying.
We have a great life here in Alaska,

1165
00:53:39.925 --> 00:53:43.303
and we're never going
back to America again.

1166
00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:45.805
I have spoken! Hmm!

1167
00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:48.892
(wind whistling)

1168
00:53:53.104 --> 00:53:55.065
(tires screeching)

1169
00:53:57.734 --> 00:54:00.654
(video game music playing)

1170
00:54:02.322 --> 00:54:03.782
(HOMER chuckling)

1171
00:54:03.865 --> 00:54:09.537
Well, I guess I've let her
worry about me long enough.

1172
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:13.208
-(whistling)
-(truck horn blows)

1173
00:54:22.259 --> 00:54:25.011
Marge? Kids?

1174
00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:27.722
Huh?

1175
00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:36.690
(static hissing)

1176
00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:40.151
Okay, here goes.

1177
00:54:40.235 --> 00:54:41.736
Homer...

1178
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:44.281
I've always stood up for you.

1179
00:54:44.364 --> 00:54:49.619
When people point out
your flaws, I always say,

1180
00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:52.289
"Well, sometimes
you have to stand back

1181
00:54:52.372 --> 00:54:54.541
"to appreciate a work of art."

1182
00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:55.542
(laughing)

1183
00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:57.377
Way back.

1184
00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.297
Lately, what's
keeping us together

1185
00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:04.843
is my ability to overlook
everything you do.

1186
00:55:04.926 --> 00:55:09.222
And I overlook these things
because...

1187
00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:10.807
Because?

1188
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:13.893
Well, that's the thing.

1189
00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:18.940
I just don't know how to finish
that sentence anymore.

1190
00:55:19.024 --> 00:55:21.985
So I'm leaving with the kids
to help Springfield,

1191
00:55:22.068 --> 00:55:25.864
and we're never coming back.

1192
00:55:28.116 --> 00:55:32.287
And to prove to myself
that this is the end...

1193
00:55:33.955 --> 00:55:37.292
I taped this
over our wedding video.

1194
00:55:39.294 --> 00:55:41.296
Good-bye, Homie.

1195
00:55:42.464 --> 00:55:44.299

1214
00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:56.913
So, Mom,
what's our plan?

1215
00:56:56.996 --> 00:56:58.623
What are you doing up there?

1216
00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:00.041
Looking through
people's luggage.

1217
00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:02.585
(high-pitched):
I'm the mascot of an evil corporation.

1218
00:57:02.669 --> 00:57:03.670
(laughs)

1219
00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:05.296
Get down from there.

1220
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.382
We have to keep
a low profile

1221
00:57:07.465 --> 00:57:09.342
till we get to Seattle
to tell the world

1222
00:57:09.426 --> 00:57:11.594
of the plot to
destroy Springfield.

1223
00:57:11.678 --> 00:57:14.180
I don't know if you guys
should be talking so loud.

1224
00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:18.601
Oh, Lisa, it's not like the government
is listening to everybody's conversation.

1225
00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:20.228
(mechanical whirring)

1226
00:57:20.311 --> 00:57:23.690
(beeping)

1227
00:57:23.773 --> 00:57:26.985
(conversations overlapping)

1228
00:57:27.068 --> 00:57:29.112
WOMAN: Hi, I'm calling about
your Meat Lover's Pizza.

1229
00:57:29.195 --> 00:57:32.490
I like meat, but I don't know
if I'm ready to love again.

1230
00:57:32.574 --> 00:57:33.950
WOMAN 2:
You hang up first.

1231
00:57:34.033 --> 00:57:35.535
MAN:
No, you hang up first.

1232
00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:36.619
WOMAN 2:
Okay.

1233
00:57:36.703 --> 00:57:38.079
(dial tone hums)

1234
00:57:38.163 --> 00:57:39.497
MAN:
She hung up on me!

1235
00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:41.708
LISA:
But we're fugitives.

1236
00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:44.502
We should just lay low
till we get to Seattle.

1237
00:57:44.586 --> 00:57:46.337
Hey, everybody! I found one!

1238
00:57:46.421 --> 00:57:50.550
The government actually
found someone we're looking for!

1239
00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:52.760
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

1240
00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:55.763
WOMAN:
Homer Simpson...

1241
00:57:57.557 --> 00:57:59.476
...do you know why you are here?

1242
00:57:59.559 --> 00:58:01.936
'Cause my family cares
more about other people

1243
00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.605
than they do about me.

1244
00:58:03.688 --> 00:58:05.732
Drink this liquid.

1245
00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:08.026
(screaming)

1246
00:58:08.109 --> 00:58:09.360
More, please.

1247
00:58:10.778 --> 00:58:12.697
Now we will cleanse your spirit

1248
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:16.409
by the ancient Inuit art
of throat singing.

1249
00:58:16.493 --> 00:58:17.869
Throat singing?

1250
00:58:17.952 --> 00:58:21.956
(guttural chanting)

1251
00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:28.505
(both chanting)

1252
00:58:28.588 --> 00:58:31.424
How long are we
doing this?

1253
00:58:31.508 --> 00:58:33.593
Until you have an epiphany.

1254
00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:34.928
Okay.

1255
00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:37.263
(chanting)

1256
00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.474
What's an epiphany?

1257
00:58:39.557 --> 00:58:42.268
Sudden realization
of great truth.

1258
00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:43.853
Okay.

1259
00:58:43.937 --> 00:58:47.190
(chanting)

1260
00:58:54.822 --> 00:58:56.491
Aw...

1261
00:58:56.574 --> 00:58:57.825
<i>(music plays)</i>

1262
00:58:57.909 --> 00:59:01.412
FEMALE CHORUS:

1266
00:59:12.674 --> 00:59:15.176
Unless you have an epiphany,

1267
00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:19.138
you will spend the remainder
of your days alone.

1268
00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:20.807
(bell tolls)

1269
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:22.475
Epiphany, epiphany, epiphany.

1270
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:26.980
Ooh! Bananas are an excellent
source of potassium.

1271
00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:28.147
(grunts)

1272
00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:30.692
Americans will
never embrace soccer?

1273
00:59:33.111 --> 00:59:35.405
More than two shakes
and it's playing with yourself?

1274
00:59:38.199 --> 00:59:40.410
Hey, what are you doing?

1275
00:59:44.372 --> 00:59:46.583
Oh, do whatever
you want to me.

1276
00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:49.210
I don't care about
myself anymore.

1277
00:59:51.629 --> 00:59:53.172
WOMAN:
Because?

1278
00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:54.507
(gasps)

1279
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:58.136
Because other people
are just as important as me.

1280
00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:02.390
Without them, I'm nothing.

1281
01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:08.438
In order to save myself...

1282
01:00:08.521 --> 01:00:11.065
I have to save Springfield!

1283
01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:13.568
That's it... isn't it?

1284
01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:18.072
<i>(</i>The Simpsons<i> theme playing,</i>

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:25.246
(chanting)

1287
01:00:26.914 --> 01:00:29.876
That was the most incredible
experience of my life.

1288
01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:32.503
And now to find my family,
save my town

1289
01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:35.381
and drop ten pounds.

1290
01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:37.467
Thank you, boob lady.

1291
01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:47.727
This is it, kids.
Seattle.

1292
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.771
(gasping):
Russ Cargill.

1293
01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:51.481
Do you think he saw us?

1294
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:56.736
Yes, I did.

1295
01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:58.780
(dogs barking)

1296
01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:05.703
Run! Run! Run! Run!

1297
01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.955
Run! Run!

1298
01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:10.541
Jump! Jump!

1299
01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:12.919
Land! Land!

1300
01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:15.296
Rest! Rest!

1301
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.423
Run! Run!

1302
01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:22.136
Now, I know we've had
a rough day,

1303
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.596
but I'm sure we can

1304
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.598
put all that behind us
and just...

1305
01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.975
(growling, screaming)

1306
01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.103
Ow! Ow!
That's my whipping arm!

1307
01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.188
(barking)

1308
01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:35.942
Oh, why does everything
I whip leave me?

1309
01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:39.946
-(wind whistling)
-Must keep going...

1310
01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.948
Must keep going.

1311
01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.866
(whimpering):
No, I can't.

1312
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.244
I can't keep going.

1313
01:01:46.327 --> 01:01:48.162
Yes, you can.

1314
01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:50.123
No, I can't.

1315
01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:52.166
Oh, shut up.

1316
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.377
You shut up.

1317
01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.462
No, you. No, you.

1318
01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:57.630
No, you.

1319
01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.173
Oh, real mature.

1320
01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:01.175
How can you say that?

1321
01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:04.220
Oh, what's the point?

1322
01:02:04.303 --> 01:02:06.139
It's hopeless.

1323
01:02:14.188 --> 01:02:15.857
Don't give up, Homer.

1324
01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.317
You are closer
than you think.

1325
01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.153
But which way do I go?

1326
01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.534
Much obliged.

1327
01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:35.918
(helicopter blades whirring)

1328
01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:37.920

1329
01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:43.885
Ten-hut!

1330
01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:48.097
(saxophone playing)

1331
01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.975
Lisa, knock off that racket!

1332
01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:52.435
(gasps):
Lisa!

1333
01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:54.520
(playing bluesy tune)

1334
01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:55.980
They captured my family.

1335
01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:57.940
What do I do? What do I do?

1336
01:03:00.067 --> 01:03:01.694
(tires screeching)

1337
01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:06.532
There's something strange
about that SOP sign.

1338
01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:10.077
(engine roaring)

1339
01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:24.717
(softly clinks)

1340
01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.260
(gasps):
Did you hear something?

1341
01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:27.678
Probably just a moth.

1342
01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:29.305
I hope it's okay.

1343
01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:36.646
(screaming):
Oh!

1344
01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:38.022
(grunts)

1345
01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:39.774
Oh!

1346
01:03:39.857 --> 01:03:41.067
D'oh!

1347
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:44.111
(grunting)

1348
01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:49.283

1350
01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:54.539
Look, look,
look, look, look.

1351
01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:56.415
We can't keep stopping
at every SOP, YELD,

1352
01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.459
or ONE VAY sign--
just move on.

1353
01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:04.423
(grunting)

1354
01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:05.591
Let us out!

1355
01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.426
-Let us out!
-Stop that!

1356
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:08.636
You'll scratch your shackles.

1357
01:04:08.719 --> 01:04:09.762
I hope I do!

1358
01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:11.514

1359
01:04:11.597 --> 01:04:13.933

1360
01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:20.273
Oh, way to go, Bart.

1361
01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.941
You stink.

1362
01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:24.569
No... you stink.

1363
01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:26.946

1364
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.197

1365
01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:29.657
Ow.

1366
01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:38.624
(bird caws)

1367
01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.293
(dog howls in distance)

1368
01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:42.962
(MARGE gasps):
Springfield.

1369
01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.673
I can't believe it, but
it got even crappier.

1370
01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:51.512
Oh, man.

1371
01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:52.889
(muttering)

1372
01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:56.809
(clanking)

1373
01:05:00.938 --> 01:05:02.315
Oh, hiya, Midge.

1374
01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:04.650
Moe, what happened?

1375
01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.861
With the town sealed off
from the rest of the world,

1376
01:05:06.944 --> 01:05:09.280
things got a little nutty here.

1377
01:05:09.363 --> 01:05:10.823
Why are you dressed like that?

1378
01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:12.241
Well, I don't
like to brag,

1379
01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:15.202
but I am now
the emperor of Springfield.

1380
01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:16.621
BARNEY:
No, you're not!

1381
01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:18.372
Yes, I am!

1382
01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:20.041
(explosion)

1383
01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:22.919
BARNEY: Okay...
hail emperor.

1384
01:05:23.002 --> 01:05:25.588
CARGILL (over screen):
Attention, Springfield.

1385
01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:28.549
Your government has realized

1386
01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:31.260
that putting you inside this
dome was a terrible mistake.

1387
01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:34.805
Therefore, we're commencing
with Operation Soaring Eagle...

1388
01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.349
(cheering)

1389
01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:38.059
...which involves
killing you all.

1390
01:05:38.142 --> 01:05:39.352
(groaning)

1391
01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:46.108
(whirring)

1392
01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:47.318
As I speak, we're lowering

1393
01:05:47.401 --> 01:05:50.237
a small but powerful bomb
into your midst.

1394
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:52.698
(beeping)

1395
01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.742
(screaming)

1396
01:05:58.996 --> 01:06:02.708
Despite everything,
I miss your father.

1397
01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.543
Me, too.

1398
01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:07.296
His big fat ass
could shield us all.

1399
01:06:12.176 --> 01:06:13.636
Ten-hut!

1400
01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.055
At ease.

1401
01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.724
I'm General...
Marriott Suites,

1402
01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:21.310
and I have an urgent
note from the president.

1403
01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:23.896
It says to release
this town immediately.

1404
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.648
Why is it written on a leaf?

1405
01:06:27.733 --> 01:06:28.943
(grunts)

1406
01:06:29.026 --> 01:06:30.778
(chuckles)

1407
01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:38.786
(hands squeaking)

1408
01:06:38.869 --> 01:06:40.037
(grunts)

1409
01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:45.418
(gasps)

1410
01:06:46.877 --> 01:06:48.462
Perfect.

1411
01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:55.261
Now Homer Simpson's going
to show he has cojones!

1412
01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:56.429
Oops.

1413
01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:58.556
(grunting)

1414
01:06:58.639 --> 01:07:00.307
(yells)

1415
01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:04.186
(grunting, crying gasps)

1416
01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:05.354
(grunts)

1417
01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:07.356
(gasping):
D'oh!

1418
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.859
(whimpering):
D'oh!

1419
01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.612
HOMER (in distance):
D'oh! D'oh!

1420
01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.614
Mom, I've got to go find Colin.

1421
01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:16.949
Not now, sweetie.

1422
01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.951
Doomsday is
family time.

1423
01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:20.995
(glass squeaking)
HOMER: Oh! Oh!

1424
01:07:21.078 --> 01:07:24.498
(beeping,
harmonica playing blues)

1425
01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:27.501
Hey, if one of us
distracts Cargill,

1426
01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:30.004
then the rest of us can
climb up that thing.

1427
01:07:30.087 --> 01:07:32.798
Who'd be dumb enough to stay behind
while we escape with our lives?

1428
01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.258
(clears throat)

1429
01:07:34.341 --> 01:07:36.802
My time to shine.

1430
01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:37.970
Hey!

1431
01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.556
Mr. Big TV Man,
