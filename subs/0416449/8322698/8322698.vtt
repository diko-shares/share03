00:01:09.443 --> 00:01:11.968
<i>When the boy was born...</i>

2
00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:14.939
<i>like all Spartans, he was inspected.</i>

3
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.380
<i>If he'd been small or puny
or sickly or misshapen...</i>

4
00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:23.887
<i>he would have been discarded.</i>

5
00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:36.698
<i>From the time he could stand,
he was baptized in the fire of combat.</i>

6
00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.422
<i>Taught never to retreat,
never to surrender.</i>

7
00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:07.465
<i>Taught that death on the battlefield
in service to Sparta...</i>

8
00:02:07.668 --> 00:02:10.967
<i>was the greatest glory
he could achieve in his life.</i>

9
00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:30.647
<i>At age 7, as is customary in Sparta...</i>

10
00:02:30.824 --> 00:02:35.989
<i>the boy was taken from his mother
and plunged into a world of violence.</i>

11
00:02:36.797 --> 00:02:41.325
<i>Manufactured by 300 years
of Spartan warrior society...</i>

12
00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.669
<i>to create the finest soldiers
the world has ever known.</i>

13
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.402
<i>The agoge, as it's called,
forces the boy to fight.</i>

14
00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:55.207
<i>Starves them, forces them to steal...</i>

15
00:02:55.382 --> 00:02:59.751
<i>and if necessary, to kill.</i>

16
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:03.813
<i>By rod and lash the boy was punished...</i>

17
00:03:03.991 --> 00:03:07.290
<i>taught to show no pain, no mercy.</i>

18
00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:12.488
<i>Constantly tested, tossed into the wild.</i>

19
00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:17.968
<i>Left to pit his wits and will
against nature's fury.</i>

20
00:03:18.338 --> 00:03:20.533
<i>It was his initiation...</i>

21
00:03:20.707 --> 00:03:23.267
<i>his time in the wild...</i>

22
00:03:23.443 --> 00:03:27.937
<i>for he would return to his people
a Spartan...</i>

23
00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:30.242
<i>or not at all.</i>

24
00:03:52.572 --> 00:03:55.439
<i>The wolf begins to circle the boy.</i>

25
00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.043
<i>Claws of black steel...</i>

26
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:00.441
<i>fur as dark night.</i>

27
00:04:00.947 --> 00:04:02.278
<i>Eyes glowing red...</i>

28
00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:06.385
<i>jewels from the pit of hell itself.</i>

29
00:04:15.128 --> 00:04:19.121
<i>The giant wolf sniffing...</i>

30
00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.359
<i>savoring the scent of the meal to come.</i>

31
00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:48.050
<i>It's not fear that grips him...</i>

32
00:04:48.662 --> 00:04:51.825
<i>only a heightened sense of things.</i>

33
00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:55.532
<i>The cold air in his lungs.</i>

34
00:04:56.103 --> 00:04:59.436
<i>Windswept pines
moving against the coming night.</i>

35
00:05:07.447 --> 00:05:09.847
<i>His hands are steady.</i>

36
00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:12.280
<i>His form...</i>

37
00:05:12.452 --> 00:05:14.545
<i>perfect.</i>

38
00:05:40.347 --> 00:05:43.077
<i>And so the boy, given up for dead...</i>

39
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.983
<i>returns to his people,
to sacred Sparta, a king!</i>

40
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:52.152
Our king, Leonidas!

41
00:05:58.064 --> 00:06:01.830
It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf and the winter cold.

42
00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:07.536
And now, as then, a beast approaches.

43
00:06:07.707 --> 00:06:12.644
Patient and confident,
savoring the meal to come.

44
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.579
But this beast
is made of men and horses...

45
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.548
swords and spears.

46
00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:24.713
An army of slaves, vast beyond imagining,
ready to devour tiny Greece.

47
00:06:25.058 --> 00:06:29.825
Ready to snuff out the world's
one hope for reason and justice.

48
00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:35.330
A beast approaches...

49
00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:43.633
and it was King Leonidas himself
who provoked it.

50
00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:56.112
That's it.

51
00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:01.318
Now, the more you sweat here,
the less you'll bleed in battle.

52
00:08:02.522 --> 00:08:04.990
My father taught me...

53
00:08:05.158 --> 00:08:07.626
that fear is always a constant.

54
00:08:07.794 --> 00:08:09.318
But accepting it...

55
00:08:09.696 --> 00:08:10.822
makes you stronger.

56
00:08:10.997 --> 00:08:12.362
My queen.

57
00:08:12.532 --> 00:08:15.365
A Persian emissary awaits Leonidas.

58
00:08:17.904 --> 00:08:19.303
In the end...

59
00:08:19.472 --> 00:08:23.033
a Spartan's true strength
is the warrior next to him.

60
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.304
So give respect and honor to him,
and it will be returned to you.

61
00:08:28.848 --> 00:08:30.338
First...

62
00:08:31.117 --> 00:08:34.052
you fight with your head.
- Then you fight with your heart.

63
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:38.084
What is it?

64
00:08:38.325 --> 00:08:40.190
A Persian messenger awaits you.

65
00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:43.962
Do not forget today's lesson.

66
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.826
- Respect and honor.
- Respect and honor.

67
00:09:02.349 --> 00:09:06.809
Councilman Theron.
You found yourself needed, for once.

68
00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:10.822
My king and queen,
I was just entertaining your guests.

69
00:09:11.024 --> 00:09:12.252
I'm sure.

70
00:09:13.493 --> 00:09:15.324
Before you speak, Persian...

71
00:09:15.495 --> 00:09:18.760
know that in Sparta everyone,
even a king's messenger...

72
00:09:18.932 --> 00:09:21.526
is held accountable
for the words of his voice.

73
00:09:22.535 --> 00:09:25.265
Now, what message do you bring?

74
00:09:26.373 --> 00:09:28.841
Earth and water.

75
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:34.740
You rode all the way from Persia
for earth and water?

76
00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:40.218
Do not be coy or stupid, Persian.
You can afford neither in Sparta.

77
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.188
What makes this woman
think she can speak among men?

78
00:09:43.356 --> 00:09:46.189
Because only Spartan women
give birth to real men.

79
00:09:47.694 --> 00:09:51.289
Let us walk to cool our tongues.

80
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.063
If you value your lives
over your complete annihilation...

81
00:09:57.237 --> 00:09:58.898
listen carefully, Leonidas.

82
00:09:59.072 --> 00:10:03.771
Xerxes conquers and controls
everything he rests his eyes upon.

83
00:10:03.943 --> 00:10:07.037
He leads an army so massive,
it shakes the ground with its march.

84
00:10:07.213 --> 00:10:09.909
So vast, it drinks the rivers dry.

85
00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:13.075
All the God-King Xerxes requires is this:

86
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.651
A simple offering of earth and water...

87
00:10:16.823 --> 00:10:20.987
a token of Sparta's submission
to the will of Xerxes.

88
00:10:32.038 --> 00:10:34.199
Submission.

89
00:10:36.376 --> 00:10:38.310
Now, that's a bit of a problem.

90
00:10:38.745 --> 00:10:39.973
See, rumor has it...

91
00:10:40.146 --> 00:10:42.774
the Athenians
have already turned you down.

92
00:10:43.683 --> 00:10:48.916
And if those philosophers and boy-lovers
have found that kind of nerve, then...

93
00:10:49.088 --> 00:10:53.320
- We must be diplomatic.
- And, of course, Spartans...

94
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.419
have their reputation to consider.

95
00:10:56.596 --> 00:11:00.623
Choose your next words carefully,
Leonidas.

96
00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:03.495
They may be your last as king.

97
00:11:43.977 --> 00:11:47.276
<i>"Earth and water."</i>

98
00:11:52.552 --> 00:11:54.645
Madman. You're a madman.

99
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:56.482
Earth and water.

100
00:11:56.856 --> 00:11:59.017
You'll find plenty of both down there.

101
00:11:59.292 --> 00:12:02.728
No man, Persian or Greek,
no man threatens a messenger.

102
00:12:03.196 --> 00:12:08.156
You bring the crowns and heads
of conquered kings to my city steps.

103
00:12:08.334 --> 00:12:10.393
You insult my queen.

104
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.301
You threaten my people
with slavery and death.

105
00:12:14.474 --> 00:12:17.409
Oh, I've chosen my words carefully,
Persian.

106
00:12:17.577 --> 00:12:19.545
Perhaps you should have done the same.

107
00:12:19.712 --> 00:12:23.375
This is blasphemy. This is madness!

108
00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:42.826
Madness?

109
00:12:43.469 --> 00:12:45.596
This is Sparta!

110
00:14:12.125 --> 00:14:14.491
Welcome, Leonidas.

111
00:14:15.094 --> 00:14:18.257
We have been expecting you.

112
00:14:24.737 --> 00:14:30.073
<i>The ephors, priests to the old gods.</i>

113
00:14:30.476 --> 00:14:32.808
<i>Inbred swine.</i>

114
00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:35.743
<i>More creature than man.</i>

115
00:14:36.182 --> 00:14:41.620
<i>Creatures whom even Leonidas
must bribe and beg.</i>

116
00:14:42.488 --> 00:14:47.323
<i>For no Spartan king has gone to war
without the ephors' blessing.</i>

117
00:14:48.995 --> 00:14:53.056
<i>The Persians claim their forces
number in the millions.</i>

118
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.965
I hope, for our sake, they exaggerate.

119
00:14:57.437 --> 00:15:01.669
But there's no question, we face
the most massive army ever assembled.

120
00:15:01.908 --> 00:15:05.241
Before your plan is heard...

121
00:15:05.411 --> 00:15:07.675
what do you offer?

122
00:15:17.223 --> 00:15:21.557
We will use our superior fighting skills...

123
00:15:21.728 --> 00:15:25.789
and the terrain of Greece herself
to destroy them.

124
00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:28.798
We will march north to the coast,
where I will make sure...

125
00:15:28.968 --> 00:15:33.871
It is August, Leonidas.
The full moon approaches.

126
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.437
The sacred and ancient festival.

127
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.706
Sparta wages no war
at the time of the Carneia.

128
00:15:41.881 --> 00:15:43.473
Sparta will burn!

129
00:15:43.916 --> 00:15:45.440
Her men will die at arms...

130
00:15:45.618 --> 00:15:49.281
and her women and children
will be slaves or worse.

131
00:15:51.424 --> 00:15:56.487
Now, we will block
the Persian coastal assault...

132
00:15:56.796 --> 00:15:59.094
by rebuilding the great Phocian Wall.

133
00:15:59.265 --> 00:16:03.964
And from there, we will funnel them into
the mountain pass we call the Hot Gates.

134
00:16:04.137 --> 00:16:08.506
Now, in that narrow corridor,
their numbers will count for nothing.

135
00:16:08.674 --> 00:16:11.268
And wave after wave of Persian attack...

136
00:16:11.444 --> 00:16:15.380
will smash against Spartan shields.

137
00:16:15.948 --> 00:16:20.248
Xerxes' losses will be so great,
his men so demoralized...

138
00:16:20.419 --> 00:16:24.822
he will have no choice
but to abandon his campaign.

139
00:16:24.991 --> 00:16:27.687
We must consult the oracle.

140
00:16:28.394 --> 00:16:30.988
Trust the gods, Leonidas.

141
00:16:31.164 --> 00:16:34.497
I'd prefer you trusted your reason.

142
00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:36.692
Your blasphemies...

143
00:16:36.869 --> 00:16:41.238
have cost us quite enough already.

144
00:16:41.974 --> 00:16:45.000
Don't compound them.

145
00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:51.880
We will consult the oracle.

146
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.511
<i>Diseased old mystics.</i>

147
00:16:57.523 --> 00:17:02.153
<i>Worthless remnants of a time
before Sparta's ascent from darkness.</i>

148
00:17:02.495 --> 00:17:05.760
<i>Remnants of a senseless tradition.</i>

149
00:17:05.932 --> 00:17:10.301
<i>Tradition even Leonidas cannot defy...</i>

150
00:17:10.469 --> 00:17:14.872
<i>for he must respect
the word of the ephors.</i>

151
00:17:15.041 --> 00:17:16.975
<i>That is the law.</i>

152
00:17:20.012 --> 00:17:24.346
<i>And no Spartan, subject or citizen,
man or woman...</i>

153
00:17:24.517 --> 00:17:28.544
<i>slave or king, is above the law.</i>

154
00:18:03.422 --> 00:18:07.688
<i>The ephors choose only
the most beautiful Spartan girls...</i>

155
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.351
<i>to live among them as oracles.</i>

156
00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:13.794
<i>Their beauty is their curse...</i>

157
00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:17.766
<i>for the old wretches
have the needs of men...</i>

158
00:18:18.771 --> 00:18:22.867
<i>and souls as black as hell.</i>

159
00:18:25.845 --> 00:18:29.042
"Pray to the winds...

160
00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.745
Sparta will fall.

161
00:18:36.689 --> 00:18:40.386
All Greece will fall.

162
00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:46.190
Trust not in men...

163
00:18:48.234 --> 00:18:51.499
honor the gods.

164
00:18:55.241 --> 00:18:58.904
Honor the Carneia."

165
00:19:00.713 --> 00:19:04.308
<i>The king's climb down is harder.</i>

166
00:19:04.483 --> 00:19:07.384
<i>Pompous, inbred swine.</i>

167
00:19:07.553 --> 00:19:10.784
<i>Worthless, diseased, rotten...</i>

168
00:19:10.957 --> 00:19:12.982
<i>corrupt.</i>

169
00:19:16.362 --> 00:19:19.991
Truly, you're in the god-king's
favor now...

170
00:19:20.566 --> 00:19:22.659
O wise and holy men.

171
00:19:22.969 --> 00:19:24.402
Yes.

172
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:29.530
And when Sparta burns,
you shall bathe in gold.

173
00:19:29.709 --> 00:19:32.303
Fresh oracles shall be delivered to you...

174
00:19:32.778 --> 00:19:34.177
daily...

175
00:19:34.347 --> 00:19:38.147
from every corner of the empire.

176
00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:17.380
Your lips can finish
what your fingers have started.

177
00:20:20.526 --> 00:20:22.994
Or has the oracle robbed you
of your desire as well?

178
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.556
It would take more than the words
of a drunken adolescent girl...

179
00:20:27.733 --> 00:20:29.428
to rob me of my desire for you.

180
00:20:33.606 --> 00:20:35.073
Then why so distant?

181
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.201
Because it seems...

182
00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:46.318
though a slave and captive
of lecherous old men...

183
00:20:46.652 --> 00:20:49.883
the oracle's words
could set fire to all that I love.

184
00:20:50.056 --> 00:20:53.719
So that is why my king loses sleep
and is forced from the warmth of his bed?

185
00:20:56.695 --> 00:21:01.029
There's only one woman's words that
should affect the mood of my husband.

186
00:21:01.867 --> 00:21:03.425
Those are mine.

187
00:21:07.606 --> 00:21:10.006
Then what must a king do
to save his world...

188
00:21:10.176 --> 00:21:14.613
when the very laws he is sworn
to protect force him to do nothing?

189
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.883
It is not a question
of what a Spartan citizen should do...

190
00:21:21.053 --> 00:21:23.920
nor a husband, nor a king.

191
00:21:24.557 --> 00:21:27.253
Instead ask yourself, my dearest love...

192
00:21:28.894 --> 00:21:30.885
what should a free man do?

193
00:22:36.362 --> 00:22:40.526
- Is this all of them?
- As you ordered. Three hundred.

194
00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:44.833
All with born sons to carry on their name.

195
00:22:55.581 --> 00:22:56.912
We are with you, sire.

196
00:22:57.283 --> 00:22:59.410
For Sparta. For freedom.

197
00:22:59.585 --> 00:23:01.553
To the death.

198
00:23:12.364 --> 00:23:14.025
He is your son.

199
00:23:14.833 --> 00:23:17.734
He is too young
to have felt a woman's warmth.

200
00:23:17.903 --> 00:23:21.862
I have others to replace him.
Astinos is as brave and ready as any.

201
00:23:22.208 --> 00:23:26.235
No younger than we were the first time
you stood next to me in battle.

202
00:23:30.015 --> 00:23:32.142
You are a good friend...

203
00:23:32.318 --> 00:23:35.810
but a better captain, there is none.

204
00:23:41.327 --> 00:23:43.261
My good king.

205
00:23:44.196 --> 00:23:47.529
My good king, the oracle has spoken.

206
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.567
The ephors have spoken.
There must be no march.

207
00:23:50.736 --> 00:23:52.533
It is the law, my lord.

208
00:23:52.705 --> 00:23:56.698
- The Spartan army must not go to war.
- Nor shall it.

209
00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.202
I've issued no such orders.

210
00:23:59.578 --> 00:24:03.105
I'm here just taking a stroll,
stretching my legs.

211
00:24:03.349 --> 00:24:08.514
These 300 men
are my personal bodyguard.

212
00:24:08.787 --> 00:24:10.948
Our army will stay in Sparta.

213
00:24:11.557 --> 00:24:12.888
Where will you go?

214
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:18.091
I hadn't really thought about it...

215
00:24:18.897 --> 00:24:21.058
but now that you ask...

216
00:24:21.233 --> 00:24:23.963
I suppose I'll head north.

217
00:24:25.404 --> 00:24:26.496
The Hot Gates?

218
00:24:29.141 --> 00:24:31.541
Move out!

219
00:24:31.744 --> 00:24:33.803
Move out!

220
00:24:34.947 --> 00:24:36.539
What shall we do?

221
00:24:38.083 --> 00:24:39.414
What can we do?

222
00:24:40.119 --> 00:24:41.848
What can you do?

223
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:48.724
Sparta will need sons.

224
00:25:36.508 --> 00:25:38.237
Spartan!

225
00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:48.747
Yes, milady?

226
00:26:04.837 --> 00:26:07.135
Come back with your shield...

227
00:26:08.073 --> 00:26:09.506
or on it.

228
00:26:10.976 --> 00:26:12.341
Yes, milady.

229
00:26:20.853 --> 00:26:23.151
<i>"Goodbye, my love."</i>

230
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:25.984
<i>He doesn't say it.</i>

231
00:26:26.492 --> 00:26:28.722
<i>There's no room for softness...</i>

232
00:26:28.894 --> 00:26:30.885
<i>not in Sparta.</i>

233
00:26:31.063 --> 00:26:33.827
<i>No place for weakness.</i>

234
00:26:37.336 --> 00:26:41.534
<i>Only the hard and strong
may call themselves Spartans.</i>

235
00:26:42.374 --> 00:26:46.868
<i>Only the hard. Only the strong.</i>

236
00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.205
<i>We march...</i>

237
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:23.405
<i>for our lands, for our families,
for our freedoms.</i>

238
00:27:24.183 --> 00:27:26.344
<i>We march.</i>

239
00:27:28.086 --> 00:27:29.747
Daxos.

240
00:27:29.922 --> 00:27:33.323
- What a pleasant surprise.
- This morning's full of surprises, Leonidas.

241
00:27:33.492 --> 00:27:35.892
- We've been tricked.
- Can't be more than a hundred.

242
00:27:36.061 --> 00:27:38.291
- This is a surprise.
- Silence.

243
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.698
This isn't their army.

244
00:27:40.866 --> 00:27:45.030
We heard Sparta was on the warpath
and we were eager to join forces.

245
00:27:45.704 --> 00:27:49.800
If it is blood you seek,
you are welcome to join us.

246
00:27:50.142 --> 00:27:53.373
But you bring only this handful
of soldiers against Xerxes?

247
00:27:53.545 --> 00:27:57.140
I see I was wrong to expect Sparta's
commitment to at least match our own.

248
00:27:58.317 --> 00:28:00.148
Doesn't it?

249
00:28:01.587 --> 00:28:03.282
You, there.

250
00:28:03.755 --> 00:28:04.949
What is your profession?

251
00:28:05.491 --> 00:28:07.618
I'm a potter, sir.

252
00:28:08.794 --> 00:28:12.560
And you, Arcadian.
What is your profession?

253
00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:16.367
- Sculptor, sir.
- Sculptor.

254
00:28:16.735 --> 00:28:18.669
- And you?
- Blacksmith.

255
00:28:23.342 --> 00:28:26.641
Spartans! What is your profession?

256
00:28:33.819 --> 00:28:35.753
You see, old friend?

257
00:28:35.921 --> 00:28:38.822
I brought more soldiers than you did.

258
00:28:48.767 --> 00:28:50.564
<i>No sleep tonight...</i>

259
00:28:51.637 --> 00:28:54.105
<i>not for the king.</i>

260
00:28:54.273 --> 00:28:56.503
<i>All his 40 years
have been a straight road...</i>

261
00:28:56.675 --> 00:29:00.236
<i>to this one gleaming moment
in destiny...</i>

262
00:29:00.412 --> 00:29:03.176
<i>this one radiant clash
of shield and spear...</i>

263
00:29:03.348 --> 00:29:06.943
<i>sword and bone, and flesh and blood.</i>

264
00:29:08.654 --> 00:29:10.451
<i>His only regret...</i>

265
00:29:10.622 --> 00:29:14.353
<i>is that he has so few to sacrifice.</i>

266
00:29:35.647 --> 00:29:37.638
We're being followed.

267
00:29:42.688 --> 00:29:44.883
It has followed us since Sparta.

268
00:29:49.828 --> 00:29:52.820
My king! Look!

269
00:30:13.785 --> 00:30:15.252
What happened here?

270
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:17.152
Where are all the people?

271
00:30:18.256 --> 00:30:19.951
Persians.

272
00:30:20.125 --> 00:30:21.922
I put their number at around 20.

273
00:30:24.296 --> 00:30:25.661
A scouting party.

274
00:30:29.034 --> 00:30:30.524
But these footprints...

275
00:30:41.913 --> 00:30:43.380
Behind us!

276
00:30:57.429 --> 00:30:58.657
Child!

277
00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.360
It's quiet now.

278
00:31:34.833 --> 00:31:36.630
They...

279
00:31:37.002 --> 00:31:41.029
They came with beasts
from the blackness.

280
00:31:42.607 --> 00:31:44.871
With their claws and fangs...

281
00:31:45.043 --> 00:31:47.273
they grabbed them.

282
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.341
Everyone...

283
00:31:51.349 --> 00:31:53.408
but me.

284
00:32:05.664 --> 00:32:07.222
The villagers.

285
00:32:07.766 --> 00:32:09.700
I found them.

286
00:32:21.213 --> 00:32:24.011
Have the gods no mercy?

287
00:32:25.183 --> 00:32:27.208
We are doomed.

288
00:32:27.385 --> 00:32:30.013
Quiet yourself.

289
00:32:33.425 --> 00:32:38.658
The child speaks of the Persian ghosts,
known from the ancient times.

290
00:32:39.531 --> 00:32:42.227
They are the hunters of men's souls.

291
00:32:43.268 --> 00:32:45.896
They cannot be killed or defeated.

292
00:32:46.505 --> 00:32:50.669
Not this darkness. Not these lmmortals.

293
00:32:52.844 --> 00:32:55.039
Immortals?

294
00:32:55.347 --> 00:32:58.407
We'll put their name to the test.

295
00:33:20.472 --> 00:33:23.236
<i>Into the Hot Gates we march.</i>

296
00:33:23.408 --> 00:33:26.707
<i>Into that narrow corridor we march...</i>

297
00:33:26.878 --> 00:33:29.142
<i>where Xerxes' numbers
count for nothing.</i>

298
00:33:30.315 --> 00:33:34.251
<i>Spartans, citizen-soldiers, freed slaves.</i>

299
00:33:34.419 --> 00:33:36.319
<i>Brave Greeks, all.</i>

300
00:33:37.322 --> 00:33:40.416
<i>Brothers, fathers, sons...</i>

301
00:33:40.592 --> 00:33:42.583
<i>we march.</i>

302
00:33:43.261 --> 00:33:47.459
<i>For honor's sake, for duty's sake,
for glory's sake, we march.</i>

303
00:33:47.632 --> 00:33:50.726
Look! Persians.

304
00:33:55.874 --> 00:33:59.605
<i>Into hell's mouth we march.</i>

305
00:34:08.653 --> 00:34:10.712
Let's watch these motherless dogs...

306
00:34:10.956 --> 00:34:15.017
as they're embraced by the loving arms
of Greece herself. Come.

307
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:19.524
True.

308
00:34:23.735 --> 00:34:26.203
It does look like rain.

309
00:34:29.507 --> 00:34:32.738
<i>Zeus stabs the sky with thunderbolts...</i>

310
00:34:33.044 --> 00:34:37.071
<i>and batters the Persian ships
with hurricane wind.</i>

311
00:34:38.216 --> 00:34:40.650
<i>Glorious.</i>

312
00:34:52.931 --> 00:34:55.798
<i>Only one among us
keeps his Spartan reserve.</i>

313
00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.674
<i>Only he.</i>

314
00:35:03.842 --> 00:35:06.310
<i>Only our king.</i>

315
00:35:23.728 --> 00:35:25.662
My queen?

316
00:35:30.835 --> 00:35:32.166
My queen...

317
00:35:32.337 --> 00:35:35.670
the courtyard is a more fitting place
for a married woman.

318
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.501
I'm afraid gossip and protocol...

319
00:35:37.676 --> 00:35:40.201
are the least of my worries now,
councilman.

320
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.711
Is such secrecy needed?

321
00:35:43.882 --> 00:35:46.544
How am I to trust beyond the walls
of my own home?

322
00:35:46.718 --> 00:35:50.449
Even here, Theron has eyes and ears
which fuel Sparta with doubt and fear.

323
00:35:50.855 --> 00:35:54.256
You speak as if all Sparta
conspires against you.

324
00:35:54.893 --> 00:35:56.952
I wish it were only against me.

325
00:35:59.597 --> 00:36:03.089
Many on our council
would vote to give all we have...

326
00:36:03.268 --> 00:36:05.133
and follow Leonidas...

327
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.438
but you must show them favor.

328
00:36:09.741 --> 00:36:12.209
And you can arrange for me
to speak to the council?

329
00:36:12.377 --> 00:36:14.811
If it is reason they want,
I will let them know.

330
00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.107
Know what, my queen?

331
00:36:17.482 --> 00:36:19.473
Freedom isn't free at all.

332
00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:22.984
That it comes with the highest of costs,
the cost of blood.

333
00:36:25.256 --> 00:36:27.884
I will do my best to gather our council.

334
00:36:28.326 --> 00:36:32.160
And its chamber
shall be filled with your voice.

335
00:36:32.497 --> 00:36:34.328
- I'm in your debt.
- No.

336
00:36:34.666 --> 00:36:38.830
Leonidas is my king as well as yours.

337
00:37:03.628 --> 00:37:05.493
I saw those ships smash on the rocks.

338
00:37:06.598 --> 00:37:07.963
How can this be?

339
00:37:08.133 --> 00:37:11.432
We saw but a fraction of the monster
that is Xerxes' army.

340
00:37:12.103 --> 00:37:14.503
There can be no victory here.

341
00:37:18.443 --> 00:37:20.138
Why do you smile?

342
00:37:21.846 --> 00:37:23.780
Arcadian...

343
00:37:23.948 --> 00:37:26.974
I have fought countless times...

344
00:37:27.252 --> 00:37:29.914
yet I've never met an adversary
who could offer me...

345
00:37:30.088 --> 00:37:32.249
what we Spartans
call "a beautiful death."

346
00:37:33.058 --> 00:37:34.719
I can only hope...

347
00:37:34.893 --> 00:37:37.623
with all the world's warriors
gathered against us...

348
00:37:37.796 --> 00:37:41.459
there might be one down there
who's up to the task.

349
00:37:52.911 --> 00:37:55.243
Move!

350
00:37:56.548 --> 00:37:59.483
Keep going, you dogs!

351
00:38:07.158 --> 00:38:09.183
Move!

352
00:38:10.628 --> 00:38:13.188
Forward, I say!

353
00:38:15.533 --> 00:38:17.125
Stop here!

354
00:38:17.969 --> 00:38:20.130
Who commands here?

355
00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.002
I am the emissary...

356
00:38:25.176 --> 00:38:27.440
to the ruler of all the world...

357
00:38:28.246 --> 00:38:32.148
the god of gods, king of kings...

358
00:38:32.317 --> 00:38:33.909
and by that authority...

359
00:38:34.085 --> 00:38:37.851
I demand that someone
show me your commander.

360
00:38:41.626 --> 00:38:47.531
Listen. Do you think the paltry dozen
you slew scares us?

361
00:38:47.699 --> 00:38:51.191
These hills swarm with our scouts.

362
00:38:51.369 --> 00:38:56.068
And do you think your pathetic wall
will do anything...

363
00:38:56.241 --> 00:39:02.544
except fall like a heap of dry leaves
in the face of...?

364
00:39:14.259 --> 00:39:16.557
Our ancestors built this wall...

365
00:39:17.295 --> 00:39:21.231
using ancient stones
from the bosom of Greece herself.

366
00:39:21.666 --> 00:39:24.032
And with a little Spartan help...

367
00:39:24.335 --> 00:39:26.803
your Persian scouts supplied the mortar.

368
00:39:27.405 --> 00:39:31.364
You will pay for your barbarism!

369
00:39:50.528 --> 00:39:52.086
My arm!

370
00:39:54.666 --> 00:39:56.531
It's not yours anymore.

371
00:39:56.801 --> 00:40:01.431
Go now. Run along and tell your Xerxes
he faces free men here...

372
00:40:01.806 --> 00:40:03.171
not slaves.

373
00:40:03.341 --> 00:40:04.569
Do it quickly...

374
00:40:04.809 --> 00:40:07.744
before we decide to make our wall
just a little bit bigger.

375
00:40:08.246 --> 00:40:09.838
No.

376
00:40:10.014 --> 00:40:12.448
Not slaves.

377
00:40:14.252 --> 00:40:17.688
Your women will be slaves.

378
00:40:18.022 --> 00:40:20.855
Your sons, your daughters...

379
00:40:21.025 --> 00:40:23.357
your elders will be slaves!

380
00:40:23.528 --> 00:40:26.292
But not you, no.

381
00:40:26.464 --> 00:40:30.525
By noon this day you will be dead men.

382
00:40:31.703 --> 00:40:37.699
A thousand nations of the Persian Empire
descend upon you.

383
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:41.601
Our arrows will blot out the sun.

384
00:40:43.381 --> 00:40:46.077
Then we will fight in the shade.

385
00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:49.382
The wall is solid.

386
00:40:49.554 --> 00:40:52.717
It'll do the job of funneling the Persians
into the Hot Gates.

387
00:40:53.057 --> 00:40:55.753
Have the men found any route
through the hills to our back?

388
00:40:56.261 --> 00:40:58.286
None, sire.

389
00:40:58.563 --> 00:41:00.121
There is such a route, good king.

390
00:41:00.665 --> 00:41:02.394
Just pass that western ridge.

391
00:41:03.067 --> 00:41:04.762
It's an old goat path.

392
00:41:04.936 --> 00:41:07.769
The Persians could use it to outflank us.

393
00:41:07.939 --> 00:41:11.670
Not one step closer, monster!

394
00:41:13.311 --> 00:41:16.906
Wise king, I humbly request an audience.

395
00:41:17.081 --> 00:41:20.448
- I'll skewer you where you stand.
- I gave no such order.

396
00:41:30.962 --> 00:41:32.190
Forgive the captain.

397
00:41:32.864 --> 00:41:34.354
He is a good soldier...

398
00:41:34.932 --> 00:41:37.560
but a bit short on manners.

399
00:41:37.735 --> 00:41:41.796
There is nothing to forgive, brave king.
I know what I look like.

400
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.265
You wear the crimson of a Spartan.

401
00:41:44.876 --> 00:41:50.508
I am Ephialtes, born of Sparta.

402
00:41:51.115 --> 00:41:55.176
My mother's love
led my parents to flee Sparta...

403
00:41:55.353 --> 00:41:56.820
lest I be discarded.

404
00:41:57.355 --> 00:42:00.153
Your shield and armor?

405
00:42:01.059 --> 00:42:02.720
My father's, sir.

406
00:42:04.062 --> 00:42:08.123
I beg you, bold king,
to permit me...

407
00:42:08.299 --> 00:42:13.327
to redeem my father's name
by serving you in combat.

408
00:42:13.638 --> 00:42:19.508
My father trained me to feel no fear,
to make spear and shield and sword...

409
00:42:19.677 --> 00:42:22.407
as much a part of me
as my own beating heart.

410
00:42:22.847 --> 00:42:26.146
I will earn my father's armor, noble king...

411
00:42:26.317 --> 00:42:28.478
by serving you in the battle.

412
00:42:33.658 --> 00:42:35.751
A fine thrust.

413
00:42:35.927 --> 00:42:37.519
I will kill many Persians.

414
00:42:43.401 --> 00:42:44.993
Raise your shield.

415
00:42:45.169 --> 00:42:47.831
- Sire?
- Raise your shield as high as you can.

416
00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.106
Your father should have taught you
how our phalanx works.

417
00:42:59.784 --> 00:43:01.081
We fight...

418
00:43:01.619 --> 00:43:04.520
as a single, impenetrable unit.

419
00:43:04.689 --> 00:43:07.624
That is the source of our strength.

420
00:43:08.459 --> 00:43:12.088
Each Spartan protects the man
to his left...

421
00:43:12.263 --> 00:43:15.460
from thigh to neck with his shield.

422
00:43:15.633 --> 00:43:20.297
A single weak spot
and the phalanx shatters.

423
00:43:21.706 --> 00:43:24.937
From thigh to neck, Ephialtes.

424
00:43:26.978 --> 00:43:29.378
I am sorry, my friend.

425
00:43:29.547 --> 00:43:32.141
- But not all of us were made to be soldiers.
- But I...

426
00:43:32.316 --> 00:43:34.750
- lf you want to help in a Spartan victory...
- Yes.

427
00:43:34.919 --> 00:43:40.084
clear the battlefield of the dead,
tend the wounded, bring them water...

428
00:43:40.258 --> 00:43:41.885
but as for the fight itself...

429
00:43:43.261 --> 00:43:45.161
I cannot use you.

430
00:43:46.998 --> 00:43:48.431
You...

431
00:43:56.307 --> 00:44:00.403
Mother! Father! You were wrong!

432
00:44:03.681 --> 00:44:05.444
You are wrong!

433
00:44:05.616 --> 00:44:10.144
Leonidas! You are wrong!

434
00:44:10.621 --> 00:44:13.089
Dispatch the Phocians to the goat path...

435
00:44:13.257 --> 00:44:17.785
and pray to the gods
nobody tells the Persians about it.

436
00:44:23.501 --> 00:44:25.059
Earthquake.

437
00:44:25.603 --> 00:44:26.831
No, captain.

438
00:44:28.439 --> 00:44:30.373
Battle formations.

439
00:44:54.265 --> 00:44:57.462
This is where we hold them.

440
00:44:57.635 --> 00:44:59.899
This is where we fight!

441
00:45:00.471 --> 00:45:02.701
This is where they die!

442
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.905
Earn these shields, boys!

443
00:45:07.645 --> 00:45:10.136
Remember this day, men...

444
00:45:10.314 --> 00:45:14.045
for it will be yours for all time.

445
00:45:25.162 --> 00:45:26.925
Spartans!

446
00:45:27.098 --> 00:45:29.225
Lay down your weapons!

447
00:45:46.117 --> 00:45:48.381
Persians!

448
00:45:48.953 --> 00:45:51.012
Come and get them!

449
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:14.137
Hold!

450
00:46:16.981 --> 00:46:18.539
Give them nothing...

451
00:46:18.983 --> 00:46:22.578
but take from them everything!

452
00:46:24.288 --> 00:46:26.017
Steady!

453
00:46:36.801 --> 00:46:38.325
Push!

454
00:46:42.173 --> 00:46:44.573
Is that the best you can do?

455
00:46:46.777 --> 00:46:48.768
Push! Push!

456
00:46:58.856 --> 00:47:00.380
Now!

457
00:47:12.203 --> 00:47:13.693
Push!

458
00:47:57.248 --> 00:47:59.842
No prisoners!

459
00:48:00.184 --> 00:48:01.913
No mercy!

460
00:49:21.232 --> 00:49:23.359
They look thirsty.

461
00:49:24.468 --> 00:49:27.403
Well, let's give them something to drink.

462
00:49:30.307 --> 00:49:32.969
To the cliffs.

463
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.761
Halt.

464
00:50:00.871 --> 00:50:02.964
Hell of a good start.

465
00:50:25.629 --> 00:50:28.097
Tuck tail!

466
00:50:33.571 --> 00:50:35.129
Persian cowards.

467
00:50:42.913 --> 00:50:45.848
- What the hell are you laughing at?
- Well, you had to say it.

468
00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:50.313
- What?
- "Fight in the shade."

469
00:51:03.834 --> 00:51:05.768
Recover.

470
00:51:29.059 --> 00:51:31.687
Today no Spartan dies.

471
00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.253
Easy, son.

472
00:52:24.481 --> 00:52:26.449
<i>We do what we were trained to do...</i>

473
00:52:26.617 --> 00:52:28.084
<i>what we were bred to do...</i>

474
00:52:28.252 --> 00:52:31.244
<i>what we were born to do.</i>

475
00:52:38.629 --> 00:52:41.621
<i>No prisoners. No mercy.</i>

476
00:52:41.799 --> 00:52:43.266
<i>A good start.</i>

477
00:53:52.736 --> 00:53:56.001
- I was afraid you might not come.
- I'm sorry, my son is...

478
00:53:56.173 --> 00:54:01.770
Is doing what children do best.
Please, don't apologize.

479
00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.907
<i>Your son starts the agoge next year.</i>

480
00:54:05.516 --> 00:54:09.509
That is always a difficult time
for a Spartan mother.

481
00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:15.183
Yes, it will be hard. But also necessary.

482
00:54:17.628 --> 00:54:21.860
You will speak before the council
in two days' time.

483
00:54:23.734 --> 00:54:25.759
My husband does not have two days.

484
00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:28.138
Think of the two days as a gift.

485
00:54:30.207 --> 00:54:32.232
It's no secret...

486
00:54:32.409 --> 00:54:35.276
Theron wants what you control.

487
00:54:35.446 --> 00:54:38.279
It's his voice you must silence.

488
00:54:38.449 --> 00:54:40.542
Make him your ally...

489
00:54:40.851 --> 00:54:43.411
and you will have your victory.

490
00:54:44.221 --> 00:54:45.984
Thank you.

491
00:54:46.323 --> 00:54:48.723
You are wise as you are kind.

492
00:55:15.786 --> 00:55:17.549
There's your mother.

493
00:55:24.027 --> 00:55:27.463
You should keep a better eye on him
if he's to be king one day.

494
00:55:27.664 --> 00:55:30.132
Be unfortunate if anything
were to happen to him.

495
00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.625
Or to his beautiful mother.

496
00:55:49.678 --> 00:55:51.168
No!

497
00:55:54.416 --> 00:55:59.854
Our Greek comrades are begging
for a crack at the Persians, sire.

498
00:56:00.155 --> 00:56:01.486
Good.

499
00:56:01.657 --> 00:56:04.421
I've got something
I think they can handle.

500
00:56:04.926 --> 00:56:06.621
Tell Daxos that I want him...

501
00:56:06.795 --> 00:56:11.323
and 20 of his best eager, sober
and ready for the next charge.

502
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.331
King Leonidas.

503
00:56:15.837 --> 00:56:19.637
- Stelios, catch your breath, boy.
- Yes, milord.

504
00:56:20.275 --> 00:56:22.402
The Persians are approaching.

505
00:56:23.779 --> 00:56:27.647
A small contingent.
Too small for an attack.

506
00:56:31.386 --> 00:56:34.947
- Captain, I leave you in charge.
- But sire...

507
00:56:35.123 --> 00:56:36.351
Relax, old friend.

508
00:56:36.525 --> 00:56:41.087
If they assassinate me,
all of Sparta goes to war.

509
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:44.624
Pray they're that stupid.

510
00:56:45.734 --> 00:56:47.429
Pray...

511
00:56:47.969 --> 00:56:50.164
we're that lucky.

512
00:56:53.308 --> 00:56:55.071
Besides...

513
00:56:57.346 --> 00:57:00.679
there's no reason we can't be civil...

514
00:57:00.982 --> 00:57:02.574
is there?

515
00:57:03.919 --> 00:57:04.908
None, sire.

516
00:57:24.296 --> 00:57:26.526
Let me guess.

517
00:57:27.265 --> 00:57:30.257
You must be Xerxes.

518
00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.475
Come, Leonidas.

519
00:57:45.917 --> 00:57:47.680
Let us reason together.

520
00:57:47.953 --> 00:57:49.921
It would be a regrettable waste...

521
00:57:50.322 --> 00:57:53.519
it would be nothing short of madness
were you, brave king...

522
00:57:53.692 --> 00:57:56.889
and your valiant troops to perish...

523
00:57:57.529 --> 00:57:59.588
all because of a simple
misunderstanding.

524
00:58:00.198 --> 00:58:03.031
- There's much our cultures could share.
- Haven't you noticed?

525
00:58:03.201 --> 00:58:05.601
We've been sharing our culture
with you all morning.

526
00:58:06.204 --> 00:58:08.468
Yours is a fascinating tribe.

527
00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.801
Even now you are defiant...

528
00:58:10.976 --> 00:58:15.106
in the face of annihilation
and the presence of a god.

529
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.305
It isn't wise to stand against me,
Leonidas.

530
00:58:17.983 --> 00:58:20.213
Imagine what a horrible fate
awaits my enemies...

531
00:58:20.385 --> 00:58:23.286
when I would gladly kill
any of my own men for victory.

532
00:58:23.455 --> 00:58:26.083
And I would die for any one of mine.

533
00:58:26.258 --> 00:58:30.490
You Greeks take pride in your logic.
I suggest you employ it.

534
00:58:30.662 --> 00:58:34.223
Consider the beautiful land
you so vigorously defend.

535
00:58:34.399 --> 00:58:36.890
Picture it reduced to ash at my whim.

536
00:58:37.135 --> 00:58:38.602
Consider the fate of your women.

537
00:58:39.204 --> 00:58:41.729
Clearly you don't know our women.

538
00:58:41.907 --> 00:58:45.434
I might as well have marched them up here,
judging by what I've seen.

539
00:58:46.545 --> 00:58:49.070
You have many slaves, Xerxes...

540
00:58:50.015 --> 00:58:52.313
but few warriors.

541
00:58:52.484 --> 00:58:56.420
It won't be long
before they fear my spears...

542
00:58:56.822 --> 00:58:59.256
more than your whips.

543
00:59:03.094 --> 00:59:05.961
It's not the lash they fear...

544
00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.361
it is my divine power.

545
00:59:11.102 --> 00:59:15.596
But I am a generous god.
I can make you rich beyond all measure.

546
00:59:16.041 --> 00:59:18.441
I will make you warlord of all Greece.

547
00:59:19.077 --> 00:59:22.979
You will carry my battle standard
to the heart of Europa.

548
00:59:23.148 --> 00:59:25.742
Your Athenian rivals...

549
00:59:26.051 --> 00:59:28.212
will kneel at your feet...

550
00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:31.718
if you will but kneel at mine.

551
00:59:32.557 --> 00:59:34.821
You are generous...

552
00:59:35.393 --> 00:59:37.793
as you are divine...

553
00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:40.157
O king of kings.

554
00:59:40.332 --> 00:59:44.234
Such an offer
only a madman would refuse.

555
00:59:44.836 --> 00:59:46.827
But the...

556
00:59:47.739 --> 00:59:50.572
The idea of kneeling, it's...

557
00:59:50.742 --> 00:59:55.270
You see, slaughtering
all those men of yours has...

558
00:59:55.447 --> 00:59:59.281
Well, it's left a nasty cramp in my leg...

559
00:59:59.451 --> 01:00:01.544
so kneeling will be hard for me.

560
01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.187
There will be no glory in your sacrifice.

561
01:00:05.357 --> 01:00:08.952
I will erase even the memory of Sparta
from the histories.

562
01:00:09.127 --> 01:00:12.324
Every piece of Greek parchment
shall be burned.

563
01:00:12.497 --> 01:00:15.830
Every Greek historian and every scribe
shall have their eyes put out...

564
01:00:16.001 --> 01:00:18.265
and their tongues
cut from their mouths.

565
01:00:18.436 --> 01:00:24.432
Why, uttering the very name of Sparta
or Leonidas will be punishable by death.

566
01:00:25.076 --> 01:00:28.341
The world will never know
you existed at all.

567
01:00:30.482 --> 01:00:35.078
The world will know
that free men stood against a tyrant.

568
01:00:35.287 --> 01:00:38.779
That few stood against many.

569
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:42.318
And before this battle was over...

570
01:00:42.594 --> 01:00:45.563
that even a god-king can bleed.

571
01:00:52.938 --> 01:00:55.133
You fought well today...

572
01:00:56.474 --> 01:00:58.374
for a woman.

573
01:00:59.544 --> 01:01:01.205
As did you.

574
01:01:01.379 --> 01:01:04.473
Maybe if I'm injured,
you'll be able to keep up with me.

575
01:01:04.983 --> 01:01:09.943
Perhaps I was so far ahead
you couldn't see me.

576
01:01:10.555 --> 01:01:13.752
More likely offering your backside
to the Thespians.

577
01:01:14.693 --> 01:01:16.320
Jealousy...

578
01:01:16.494 --> 01:01:18.985
does not become you, my friend.

579
01:01:21.733 --> 01:01:24.065
Move it, men!

580
01:01:26.171 --> 01:01:28.401
Pile those Persians high.

581
01:01:31.543 --> 01:01:34.341
For unless I miss my guess...

582
01:01:34.913 --> 01:01:37.905
we're in for one wild night.

583
01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:07.005
<i>They have served the dark will
of Persian kings for 500 years.</i>

584
01:02:07.178 --> 01:02:09.510
<i>Eyes as dark as night.</i>

585
01:02:09.681 --> 01:02:11.672
<i>Teeth filed to fangs.</i>

586
01:02:13.785 --> 01:02:16.049
<i>Soulless.</i>

587
01:02:23.461 --> 01:02:28.228
<i>The personal guard to King Xerxes himself.
The Persian warrior elite.</i>

588
01:02:30.035 --> 01:02:33.129
<i>The deadliest fighting force in all of Asia:</i>

589
01:02:33.905 --> 01:02:35.964
<i>The Immortals.</i>

590
01:02:44.182 --> 01:02:47.583
<i>The god-king has betrayed a fatal flaw:</i>

591
01:02:48.086 --> 01:02:49.849
<i>Hubris.</i>

592
01:02:52.090 --> 01:02:54.854
<i>Easy to taunt, easy to trick.</i>

593
01:02:55.527 --> 01:02:57.961
<i>Before wounds and weariness
have taken their toll...</i>

594
01:02:58.129 --> 01:03:01.656
<i>the mad king
throws the best he has at us.</i>

595
01:03:02.167 --> 01:03:03.862
<i>Xerxes has taken the bait.</i>

596
01:03:04.035 --> 01:03:05.832
Spartans, push!

597
01:03:16.514 --> 01:03:18.106
<i>Immortals.</i>

598
01:03:18.583 --> 01:03:21.552
<i>We put their name to the test.</i>

599
01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:07.163
Father!

600
01:05:52.837 --> 01:05:54.099
My king!

601
01:07:06.878 --> 01:07:08.846
Arcadians, now!

602
01:07:11.149 --> 01:07:13.913
Go! Show the Spartans what we can do.

603
01:07:14.519 --> 01:07:15.952
Go!

604
01:07:25.363 --> 01:07:27.263
<i>They shout and curse...</i>

605
01:07:27.432 --> 01:07:30.629
<i>stabbing wildly,
more brawlers than warriors.</i>

606
01:07:31.769 --> 01:07:34.329
<i>They make a wondrous mess of things.</i>

607
01:07:35.373 --> 01:07:38.137
<i>Brave amateurs, they do their part.</i>

608
01:08:25.757 --> 01:08:27.622
<i>Immortals.</i>

609
01:08:27.792 --> 01:08:30.386
<i>They fail our king's test.</i>

610
01:08:30.561 --> 01:08:33.496
<i>And a man who fancies himself a god...</i>

611
01:08:34.232 --> 01:08:39.169
<i>feels a very human chill
crawl up his spine.</i>

612
01:08:46.277 --> 01:08:48.404
To our king!

613
01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.771
And our honored dead.

614
01:08:50.948 --> 01:08:53.746
Whom will Xerxes dare to send next?
Whom?

615
01:08:54.085 --> 01:08:56.781
There's nothing that can stop us now!

616
01:08:57.655 --> 01:09:01.182
<i>Even the king allows himself
to hope for more than glory.</i>

617
01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:04.692
<i>Such mad hope, but there it is:</i>

618
01:09:05.129 --> 01:09:10.533
<i>"Against Asia's endless hordes,
against all odds, we can do it.</i>

619
01:09:10.701 --> 01:09:13.431
<i>We can hold the Hot Gates.</i>

620
01:09:13.604 --> 01:09:15.731
<i>We can win. "</i>

621
01:09:23.314 --> 01:09:25.077
<i>Dawn.</i>

622
01:09:25.683 --> 01:09:29.710
<i>Whips crack. Barbarians howl.</i>

623
01:09:29.887 --> 01:09:33.789
<i>Those behind cry, "Forward!"</i>

624
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:39.460
<i>Those in front cry, "Back!"</i>

625
01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:48.095
<i>Our eyes bear witness
to the grotesque spectacle...</i>

626
01:09:48.272 --> 01:09:52.368
<i>coughed forth from the darkest corner
of Xerxes' empire.</i>

627
01:10:42.593 --> 01:10:44.117
<i>When muscle failed...</i>

628
01:10:44.562 --> 01:10:47.224
<i>they turned to their magic.</i>

629
01:10:48.266 --> 01:10:53.067
<i>One hundred nations descend upon us,
the armies of all Asia.</i>

630
01:10:53.237 --> 01:10:57.697
<i>Funneled into this narrow corridor,
their numbers count for nothing.</i>

631
01:11:32.076 --> 01:11:34.044
<i>They fall by the hundreds.</i>

632
01:11:34.211 --> 01:11:39.808
<i>We send the severed bodies
and the fragile hearts back to Xerxes' feet.</i>

633
01:11:56.434 --> 01:12:00.598
<i>King Xerxes is displeased
with his generals.</i>

634
01:12:00.771 --> 01:12:03.331
<i>He disciplines them.</i>

635
01:12:20.224 --> 01:12:24.627
<i>Xerxes dispatches his monsters
from half the world away.</i>

636
01:12:35.606 --> 01:12:37.699
<i>They're clumsy beasts...</i>

637
01:12:37.875 --> 01:12:40.241
<i>and the piled Persian dead are slippery.</i>

638
01:13:16.681 --> 01:13:19.115
- You still here?
- Somebody's gotta watch your back.

639
01:13:19.283 --> 01:13:20.875
Not now, I'm a little busy.

640
01:14:01.158 --> 01:14:03.683
Regroup!

641
01:14:06.897 --> 01:14:08.524
Astinos!

642
01:14:08.733 --> 01:14:10.428
My son!

643
01:14:19.376 --> 01:14:21.003
Astinos!

644
01:14:21.178 --> 01:14:23.942
No!

645
01:14:47.204 --> 01:14:49.331
<i>Day wears on.</i>

646
01:14:49.673 --> 01:14:51.834
<i>We lose few...</i>

647
01:14:52.009 --> 01:14:55.240
<i>but each felled is a friend,
or dearest blood.</i>

648
01:14:57.448 --> 01:15:01.350
<i>And upon seeing the headless body
of his own young son...</i>

649
01:15:01.519 --> 01:15:03.384
<i>the captain breaks rank.</i>

650
01:15:03.554 --> 01:15:06.990
<i>He goes wild, blood-drunk.</i>

651
01:15:31.615 --> 01:15:34.106
<i>The captain's cries of pain
at the loss of his son...</i>

652
01:15:34.285 --> 01:15:38.016
<i>are more frightening to the enemy
than the deepest battle drums.</i>

653
01:15:38.189 --> 01:15:42.182
<i>It takes three men to restrain him
and bring him back to our own.</i>

654
01:15:42.526 --> 01:15:44.858
<i>The day is ours.</i>

655
01:15:45.262 --> 01:15:47.924
<i>No songs are sung.</i>

656
01:16:28.038 --> 01:16:32.634
Your gods were cruel to shape you so,
friend Ephialtes.

657
01:16:35.045 --> 01:16:36.342
The Spartans, too...

658
01:16:37.081 --> 01:16:39.982
were cruel to reject you.

659
01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:45.254
But I am kind.

660
01:16:51.762 --> 01:16:53.889
Everything you could ever desire...

661
01:16:55.132 --> 01:16:56.895
every happiness you can imagine...

662
01:16:59.103 --> 01:17:03.699
every pleasure your fellow Greeks
and your false gods have denied you...

663
01:17:04.508 --> 01:17:06.772
I will grant you.

664
01:17:08.045 --> 01:17:10.445
For I am kind.

665
01:17:24.395 --> 01:17:27.694
Embrace me as your king
and as your god.

666
01:17:28.832 --> 01:17:30.527
Yes.

667
01:17:32.002 --> 01:17:36.803
Lead my soldiers to the hidden path
that enters behind the cursed Spartans...

668
01:17:36.974 --> 01:17:39.238
and your joys will be endless.

669
01:17:47.685 --> 01:17:50.848
Yes! I want it all.

670
01:17:51.288 --> 01:17:54.849
Wealth. Women.

671
01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.555
And one more thing...

672
01:18:01.732 --> 01:18:04.394
I want a uniform.

673
01:18:08.906 --> 01:18:10.601
Done.

674
01:18:12.242 --> 01:18:13.937
You will find...

675
01:18:14.545 --> 01:18:16.479
I am kind.

676
01:18:17.614 --> 01:18:21.846
Unlike the cruel Leonidas,
who demanded that you stand...

677
01:18:23.954 --> 01:18:25.649
I require only...

678
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:27.823
that you kneel.

679
01:18:55.486 --> 01:18:57.420
Beautiful night.

680
01:18:58.856 --> 01:19:02.849
Yes, but I did not ask you here
for small talk, Theron.

681
01:19:03.494 --> 01:19:05.587
You can be sure of that.

682
01:19:06.997 --> 01:19:09.659
You never spared words with me.

683
01:19:10.234 --> 01:19:13.499
Can I offer you something?
A drink, perhaps?

684
01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:15.501
Is it poison?

685
01:19:15.906 --> 01:19:18.670
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
it's only water.

686
01:19:28.452 --> 01:19:31.615
I'm told it's been arranged for you
to go before the council.

687
01:19:32.289 --> 01:19:34.018
Yes.

688
01:19:34.224 --> 01:19:37.557
I need your help in winning votes
to send the army north to our king.

689
01:19:38.128 --> 01:19:39.755
Yes.

690
01:19:40.431 --> 01:19:42.991
I can see it,
the two of us standing together.

691
01:19:43.167 --> 01:19:47.536
Me, politician. You, warrior.
Our voices as one.

692
01:19:48.872 --> 01:19:50.339
But why would I want to do that?

693
01:19:51.308 --> 01:19:55.267
It proves you care for a king who right now
fights for the very water we drink.

694
01:19:55.612 --> 01:19:57.204
True.

695
01:19:57.581 --> 01:20:00.209
But this is politics, not war.

696
01:20:00.517 --> 01:20:02.041
Leonidas is an idealist.

697
01:20:02.453 --> 01:20:06.389
I know your kind too well. You send men
to slaughter for your own gain.

698
01:20:06.557 --> 01:20:11.460
Your husband, our king,
has taken 300 of our finest to slaughter.

699
01:20:11.628 --> 01:20:16.258
He's broken our laws
and left without the council's consent.

700
01:20:16.767 --> 01:20:19.759
- I'm simply a realist.
- You're an opportunist.

701
01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:25.037
You're as foolish as Leonidas if you think
men don't have a price in this world.

702
01:20:25.209 --> 01:20:29.771
All men are not created equal.
That's the Spartan code, my little queen.

703
01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:35.850
I admire your passion.

704
01:20:37.187 --> 01:20:38.916
But don't think that you...

705
01:20:39.356 --> 01:20:41.688
a woman, even a queen...

706
01:20:41.859 --> 01:20:45.795
can walk into the council chamber
and sway the minds of men.

707
01:20:45.963 --> 01:20:48.397
I own that chamber...

708
01:20:48.565 --> 01:20:50.624
as if it were built with these hands.

709
01:20:55.105 --> 01:20:58.632
I could crush
the life out of you right now.

710
01:20:59.710 --> 01:21:03.373
You will go before the council,
but your words will fall on deaf ears.

711
01:21:03.547 --> 01:21:09.315
Leonidas will receive no reinforcements,
and if he returns, without my help...

712
01:21:09.486 --> 01:21:12.455
he will go to jail or worse.

713
01:21:16.193 --> 01:21:17.660
Do you love your Sparta?

714
01:21:18.162 --> 01:21:19.857
Yes.

715
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:22.294
- And your king?
- I do.

716
01:21:28.138 --> 01:21:31.835
Your husband fights for his land
and his love.

717
01:21:32.509 --> 01:21:34.807
What do you have to offer...

718
01:21:35.579 --> 01:21:38.548
in return for my word
that I'll help you send our army north?

719
01:21:42.519 --> 01:21:45.181
What does a realist want with his queen?

720
01:21:49.793 --> 01:21:51.522
I think you know.

721
01:22:05.976 --> 01:22:08.672
This will not be over quickly.

722
01:22:09.713 --> 01:22:12.204
You will not enjoy this.

723
01:22:12.749 --> 01:22:15.013
I'm not your king.

724
01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:41.607
Dilios.

725
01:22:43.614 --> 01:22:47.641
I trust that scratch
hasn't made you useless?

726
01:22:47.818 --> 01:22:50.844
Hardly, my lord. It's just an eye.

727
01:22:51.021 --> 01:22:54.218
The gods saw fit to grace me
with a spare.

728
01:22:56.093 --> 01:22:58.027
My captain?

729
01:22:59.329 --> 01:23:03.129
Curses the gods and mourns alone.

730
01:23:05.102 --> 01:23:07.070
Leonidas!

731
01:23:08.272 --> 01:23:11.264
We are undone.
Undone, I tell you. Destroyed.

732
01:23:11.441 --> 01:23:12.874
Daxos, calm yourself.

733
01:23:13.043 --> 01:23:16.638
Our hunchback traitor led Xerxes' lmmortals
to the hidden goat path behind us.

734
01:23:17.047 --> 01:23:19.880
The Phocians you posted there
were scattered without a fight.

735
01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:25.283
- This battle is over, Leonidas.
- This battle is over when I say it is over.

736
01:23:25.455 --> 01:23:29.824
By morning, the lmmortals will surround us.
The Hot Gates will fall.

737
01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:34.829
Spartans! Prepare for glory!

738
01:23:34.998 --> 01:23:38.195
Glory? Have you gone mad?

739
01:23:38.368 --> 01:23:39.926
There is no glory to be had now.

740
01:23:40.537 --> 01:23:44.132
Only retreat or surrender. Or death.

741
01:23:44.308 --> 01:23:47.471
Well, that's an easy choice
for us, Arcadian.

742
01:23:47.644 --> 01:23:53.139
Spartans never retreat.
Spartans never surrender.

743
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:55.843
Go spread the word.

744
01:23:56.086 --> 01:23:59.749
Let every Greek assembled
know the truth of this.

745
01:23:59.923 --> 01:24:02.756
Let each among them
search his own soul.

746
01:24:04.461 --> 01:24:08.591
And while you're at it, search your own.

747
01:24:16.106 --> 01:24:18.370
My men will leave with me.

748
01:24:23.714 --> 01:24:25.944
Godspeed, Leonidas.

749
01:24:32.255 --> 01:24:33.847
Children!

750
01:24:34.825 --> 01:24:36.156
Children.

751
01:24:37.194 --> 01:24:39.185
Gather round.

752
01:24:41.064 --> 01:24:44.329
No retreat, no surrender.

753
01:24:44.501 --> 01:24:48.369
That is Spartan law.

754
01:24:48.605 --> 01:24:53.668
And by Spartan law,
we will stand and fight...

755
01:24:53.844 --> 01:24:55.835
and die.

756
01:24:59.282 --> 01:25:02.774
A new age has begun.

757
01:25:04.521 --> 01:25:07.649
An age of freedom.

758
01:25:08.725 --> 01:25:12.388
And all will know that 300 Spartans...

759
01:25:12.562 --> 01:25:15.827
gave their last breath to defend it.

760
01:25:36.119 --> 01:25:37.882
My friend.

761
01:25:41.425 --> 01:25:46.988
I have lived my entire life
without regret until now.

762
01:25:50.367 --> 01:25:56.306
It's not that my son
gave up his life for his country.

763
01:25:58.208 --> 01:26:02.076
It's just that I never told him
that I loved him the most.

764
01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.547
That he stood by me with honor.

765
01:26:07.984 --> 01:26:10.919
That he was all that was best in me.

766
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:22.555
My heart is broken for your loss.

767
01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.995
Heart?

768
01:26:30.073 --> 01:26:33.167
I have filled my heart...

769
01:26:33.343 --> 01:26:35.072
with hate.

770
01:26:39.216 --> 01:26:40.877
Good.

771
01:26:50.026 --> 01:26:51.857
Dilios...

772
01:26:53.563 --> 01:26:55.690
let's take a walk.

773
01:26:57.167 --> 01:26:59.226
Yes, my lord.

774
01:27:01.638 --> 01:27:04.300
But, sire, I am fit and ready for battle.

775
01:27:04.474 --> 01:27:07.602
That you are, one of the finest.

776
01:27:07.911 --> 01:27:11.506
But you have another talent
unlike any other Spartan.

777
01:27:14.217 --> 01:27:17.653
You will deliver my final orders
to the council...

778
01:27:17.821 --> 01:27:20.312
with force and verve.

779
01:27:22.826 --> 01:27:25.090
Tell them our story.

780
01:27:25.262 --> 01:27:29.790
Make every Greek know
what happened here.

781
01:27:30.634 --> 01:27:33.262
You'll have a grand tale to tell.

782
01:27:35.071 --> 01:27:36.766
A tale of victory.

783
01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.998
Victory.

784
01:27:43.046 --> 01:27:45.037
Yes, my lord.

785
01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.086
Sire, any message...?

786
01:27:55.959 --> 01:27:57.324
For the queen?

787
01:28:19.783 --> 01:28:22.217
None that need be spoken.

788
01:28:37.334 --> 01:28:39.734
<i>Hundreds leave.</i>

789
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:42.804
<i>A handful stay.</i>

790
01:28:47.978 --> 01:28:50.606
<i>Only one looks back.</i>

791
01:29:00.924 --> 01:29:03.119
Spartans!

792
01:29:04.194 --> 01:29:07.357
Ready your breakfast and eat hearty...

793
01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:11.466
for tonight we dine in hell!

794
01:29:20.343 --> 01:29:23.005
May I give the floor now...

795
01:29:23.179 --> 01:29:27.616
to the wife of Leonidas
and queen of Sparta.

796
01:29:39.329 --> 01:29:41.058
- What's this?
- This is nothing.

797
01:29:41.231 --> 01:29:43.062
Councilmen...

798
01:29:43.233 --> 01:29:46.999
I stand before you
not only as your queen.

799
01:29:47.871 --> 01:29:50.601
I come to you as a mother.

800
01:29:51.875 --> 01:29:54.275
I come to you as a wife.

801
01:29:56.079 --> 01:29:58.604
I come to you as a Spartan woman.

802
01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:06.714
I come to you with great humility.

803
01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.560
I am not here to represent Leonidas.

804
01:30:12.729 --> 01:30:15.493
His actions speak louder
than my words ever could.

805
01:30:15.832 --> 01:30:18.232
I am here for all those voices
which cannot be heard.

806
01:30:18.401 --> 01:30:20.926
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons.

807
01:30:21.104 --> 01:30:24.073
Three hundred families
that bleed for our rights...

808
01:30:24.507 --> 01:30:27.704
and for the very principles
this room was built upon.

809
01:30:28.311 --> 01:30:30.404
We are at war, gentlemen.

810
01:30:30.847 --> 01:30:33.372
We must send the entire Spartan army
to aid our king...

811
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:36.644
in the preservation of not just ourselves,
but of our children.

812
01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:40.348
Send the army
for the preservation of liberty.

813
01:30:40.523 --> 01:30:42.855
Send it for justice.

814
01:30:43.026 --> 01:30:44.653
Send it for law and order.

815
01:30:45.195 --> 01:30:47.390
Send it for reason.

816
01:30:47.564 --> 01:30:51.660
But most importantly,
send our army for hope.

817
01:30:51.835 --> 01:30:55.396
Hope that a king and his men have not
been wasted to the pages of history.

818
01:30:56.239 --> 01:30:59.675
That their courage bonds us together.

819
01:30:59.976 --> 01:31:03.173
That we are made stronger
by their actions...

820
01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:08.276
and that your choices today
reflect their bravery.

821
01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:11.881
Three hundred.

822
01:31:14.224 --> 01:31:16.055
We must send them.

823
01:31:19.829 --> 01:31:21.660
Moving...

824
01:31:21.998 --> 01:31:24.899
eloquent, passionate.

825
01:31:25.301 --> 01:31:29.465
But it doesn't change the fact
that your husband has brought war upon us.

826
01:31:29.639 --> 01:31:32.073
You are wrong.
Xerxes brought it forth...

827
01:31:32.242 --> 01:31:34.710
and before that,
his father Darius at Marathon.

828
01:31:34.878 --> 01:31:36.607
The Persians will not stop...

829
01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:40.147
until the only shelter we will find
is rubble and chaos.

830
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:44.281
This chamber needs no
history lesson, my queen.

831
01:31:44.788 --> 01:31:46.983
Then what is the lesson
you would like to leave?

832
01:31:47.157 --> 01:31:49.250
Shall I begin to enumerate all of them?

833
01:31:49.659 --> 01:31:53.095
Honor. Duty. Glory.

834
01:31:53.363 --> 01:31:58.391
You speak of honor, duty and glory?

835
01:31:59.702 --> 01:32:00.930
But what of adultery?

836
01:32:01.104 --> 01:32:03.572
- How dare you.
- How dare I?

837
01:32:04.007 --> 01:32:06.999
Watch her carefully.

838
01:32:07.177 --> 01:32:10.146
She is a trickster in true form.

839
01:32:10.313 --> 01:32:13.476
Do not play with the members
of this sacred chamber, my queen.

840
01:32:13.650 --> 01:32:16.744
Just hours ago,
you offered yourself to me.

841
01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:21.357
Were I a weaker man,
I would have her scent on me still.

842
01:32:21.524 --> 01:32:24.516
- This is outrage.
- Oh, the hypocrite speaks!

843
01:32:24.694 --> 01:32:27.686
Did you not receive a similar payment,
which you took...

844
01:32:27.864 --> 01:32:31.095
in exchange for her having an audience
with these noble men?

845
01:32:31.267 --> 01:32:33.030
- That is a lie.
- Is it?

846
01:32:33.203 --> 01:32:36.969
Was he not, by your invitation,
asked to come to the king's bedchamber?

847
01:32:37.507 --> 01:32:42.137
The very bed where you attempted
to negotiate with me so vigorously?

848
01:32:44.781 --> 01:32:48.239
You look shocked.
A bribe of the flesh, gentlemen...

849
01:32:48.418 --> 01:32:51.717
while her husband
promotes anarchy and war.

850
01:32:54.657 --> 01:32:55.851
He speaks truth.

851
01:32:56.459 --> 01:32:59.656
Words escape
even the most cunning tongue...

852
01:32:59.829 --> 01:33:01.888
my little whore queen.

853
01:33:06.636 --> 01:33:08.467
What queen-like behavior.

854
01:33:10.173 --> 01:33:13.301
Remove her from this chamber
before she infects us further...

855
01:33:13.476 --> 01:33:16.468
with her inglorious and shabby self.

856
01:33:23.286 --> 01:33:24.878
This will not be over quickly.

857
01:33:26.222 --> 01:33:29.749
You will not enjoy this.
I am not your queen.

858
01:33:51.915 --> 01:33:53.849
Traitor.

859
01:33:54.384 --> 01:33:59.185
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

860
01:33:59.455 --> 01:34:01.719
<i>Traitor!</i>

861
01:34:38.761 --> 01:34:44.757
Leonidas, my compliments
and congratulations.

862
01:34:44.934 --> 01:34:48.597
You surely have turned calamity
into victory.

863
01:34:48.771 --> 01:34:51.763
Despite your insufferable arrogance...

864
01:34:51.941 --> 01:34:56.105
the god-king has come
to admire Spartan valor and fighting skill.

865
01:34:56.846 --> 01:34:58.211
You will make a mighty ally.

866
01:34:58.381 --> 01:35:00.110
Yield, Leonidas.

867
01:35:01.284 --> 01:35:04.151
Use your reason. Think of your men.

868
01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:08.617
I beg you.

869
01:35:09.192 --> 01:35:11.160
Listen to your fellow Greek.

870
01:35:11.327 --> 01:35:15.024
He can attest
to the divine one's generosity.

871
01:35:15.198 --> 01:35:19.658
Despite your several insults,
despite your horrid blasphemies...

872
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:23.767
the lord of hosts
is prepared to forgive all...

873
01:35:24.007 --> 01:35:27.033
and more, to reward your service.

874
01:35:27.310 --> 01:35:28.641
You fight for your lands.

875
01:35:29.345 --> 01:35:31.176
Keep them.

876
01:35:31.881 --> 01:35:33.849
You fight for Sparta.

877
01:35:34.017 --> 01:35:38.010
She will be wealthier and more powerful
than ever before.

878
01:35:38.221 --> 01:35:40.155
You fight for your kingship.

879
01:35:41.057 --> 01:35:44.026
You will be proclaimed warlord
of all Greece...

880
01:35:44.193 --> 01:35:48.493
answerable only
to the one true master of the world.

881
01:35:48.865 --> 01:35:53.598
Leonidas, your victory will be complete...

882
01:35:53.770 --> 01:35:56.364
if you but lay down your arms...

883
01:35:56.539 --> 01:35:59.702
and kneel to holy Xerxes.

884
01:36:30.206 --> 01:36:35.143
<i>It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf in the winter cold.</i>

885
01:36:35.311 --> 01:36:39.873
<i>And now, as then,
it's not fear that grips him...</i>

886
01:36:40.049 --> 01:36:45.214
<i>only restlessness.
A heightened sense of things.</i>

887
01:36:45.988 --> 01:36:50.789
<i>The seaborne breeze coolly kissing
the sweat at his chest and neck.</i>

888
01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:52.450
<i>Gulls cawing...</i>

889
01:36:52.628 --> 01:36:56.860
<i>complaining even as they feast
on the thousands of floating dead.</i>

890
01:36:58.468 --> 01:37:03.531
<i>The steady breathing
of the 300 at his back...</i>

891
01:37:04.307 --> 01:37:07.765
<i>ready to die for him
without a moment's pause.</i>

892
01:37:10.379 --> 01:37:11.744
<i>Every one of them...</i>

893
01:37:13.216 --> 01:37:15.150
<i>ready to die.</i>

894
01:37:30.666 --> 01:37:33.601
<i>His helmet is stifling.</i>

895
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:57.123
<i>His shield is heavy.</i>

896
01:38:04.734 --> 01:38:06.099
Your spear.

897
01:38:14.911 --> 01:38:16.344
You there...

898
01:38:16.779 --> 01:38:18.770
Ephialtes.

899
01:38:23.886 --> 01:38:26.150
May you live forever.

900
01:38:33.563 --> 01:38:35.861
Leonidas, your spear.

901
01:39:43.099 --> 01:39:44.691
Stelios!

902
01:39:54.710 --> 01:39:56.302
Slaughter them!

903
01:39:59.682 --> 01:40:01.274
<i>His helmet was stifling.</i>

904
01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:04.578
<i>It narrowed his vision,
and he must see far.</i>

905
01:40:05.888 --> 01:40:09.756
<i>His shield was heavy.
It threw him off balance...</i>

906
01:40:09.925 --> 01:40:13.588
<i>and his target is far away.</i>

907
01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:22.722
<i>The old ones say we Spartans
are descended from Hercules himself.</i>

908
01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:28.534
<i>Bold Leonidas gives testament
to our bloodline.</i>

909
01:41:28.704 --> 01:41:32.834
<i>His roar is long and loud.</i>

910
01:42:02.938 --> 01:42:04.530
My king.

911
01:42:16.786 --> 01:42:20.415
It's an honor to die at your side.

912
01:42:21.991 --> 01:42:26.485
It's an honor to have lived at yours.

913
01:42:47.416 --> 01:42:49.509
My queen!

914
01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.489
My wife.

915
01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:12.737
My love.

916
01:45:39.154 --> 01:45:41.281
<i>"Remember us."</i>

917
01:45:42.958 --> 01:45:46.394
<i>As simple an order as a king can give.</i>

918
01:45:47.963 --> 01:45:51.160
<i>"Remember why we died."</i>

919
01:45:53.168 --> 01:45:57.195
For he did not wish tribute or song...

920
01:45:59.041 --> 01:46:03.239
nor monuments,
nor poems of war and valor.

921
01:46:06.115 --> 01:46:08.413
His wish was simple.

922
01:46:13.789 --> 01:46:15.848
"Remember us"...

923
01:46:16.892 --> 01:46:18.621
he said to me.

924
01:46:20.295 --> 01:46:22.490
<i>That was his hope.</i>

925
01:46:22.698 --> 01:46:26.429
<i>Should any free soul
come across that place...</i>

926
01:46:27.202 --> 01:46:30.535
<i>in all the countless
centuries yet to be...</i>

927
01:46:30.973 --> 01:46:33.533
<i>may all our voices...</i>

928
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:37.770
<i>whisper to you
from the ageless stones.</i>

929
01:46:38.747 --> 01:46:42.376
<i>Go tell the Spartans, passerby...</i>

930
01:46:42.718 --> 01:46:48.588
<i>that here, by Spartan law, we lie.</i>

931
01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:54.056
<i>And so my king died...</i>

932
01:46:54.930 --> 01:46:57.558
<i>and my brothers died...</i>

933
01:46:59.935 --> 01:47:02.403
barely a year ago.

934
01:47:06.341 --> 01:47:11.574
Long I pondered my king's
cryptic talk of victory.

935
01:47:11.814 --> 01:47:14.442
Time has proven him wise.

936
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:18.376
For from free Greek to free Greek...

937
01:47:18.554 --> 01:47:23.150
the word was spread
that bold Leonidas and his 300...

938
01:47:23.325 --> 01:47:25.316
so far from home...

939
01:47:25.494 --> 01:47:28.895
laid down their lives
not just for Sparta...

940
01:47:29.064 --> 01:47:32.864
but for all Greece
and the promise this country holds.

941
01:47:33.769 --> 01:47:38.832
Now, here on this rugged patch of earth
called Plataea...

942
01:47:39.007 --> 01:47:44.001
Xerxes' hordes face obliteration!

943
01:47:45.681 --> 01:47:49.082
Just there the barbarians huddle...

944
01:47:49.251 --> 01:47:54.120
sheer terror gripping tight their hearts...

945
01:47:54.289 --> 01:47:56.189
with icy fingers...

946
01:47:56.358 --> 01:47:59.589
knowing full well
what merciless horrors they suffered...

947
01:47:59.762 --> 01:48:02.287
at the swords and spears of 300.

948
01:48:03.699 --> 01:48:09.262
Yet they stare now across the plain
at 10,000 Spartans...

949
01:48:09.438 --> 01:48:12.737
commanding 30,000 free Greeks!

950
01:48:19.548 --> 01:48:23.450
The enemy outnumber us
a paltry three to one.

951
01:48:23.752 --> 01:48:25.743
Good odds for any Greek.

952
01:48:26.455 --> 01:48:31.154
This day, we rescue a world
from mysticism and tyranny...

953
01:48:31.326 --> 01:48:35.695
and usher in a future
brighter than anything we can imagine.

954
01:48:40.135 --> 01:48:41.625
Give thanks, men...

955
01:48:42.337 --> 01:48:46.103
to Leonidas and the brave 300.

956
01:48:46.275 --> 01:48:49.005
To victory!

957
01:56:28.397 --> 01:56:30.388
