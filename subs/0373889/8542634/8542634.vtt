00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:56.776
<i>I don't know about you,
but it's just too hot today, isn't it?</i>

2
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.415
<i>And it's gonna get even worse.</i>

3
00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.325
<i>Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius.</i>

4
00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.077
<i>That's the mid-90s Fahrenheit.</i>

5
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.421
<i>Tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.</i>

6
00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:08.138
<i>So please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...</i>

7
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.377
<i>...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.</i>

8
00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:13.353
Come on, guys, time to go home.

9
00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:16.105
Come on, love, off you get.

10
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.445
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

11
00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:24.877
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

12
00:01:27.132 --> 00:01:28.908
- He squealed like a pig, didn't he?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:31.870
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

14
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.738
Hey, Big D.

15
00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:36.905
Beat up another 10-year-old?

16
00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:38.455
This one deserved it.

17
00:01:38.812 --> 00:01:39.836
- Yeah.
- Of course he did.

18
00:01:40.354 --> 00:01:42.320
Five against one, very brave.

19
00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:43.684
Well, you're one to talk.

20
00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:46.783
Moaning in your sleep every night?

21
00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.886
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

22
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.394
"Don't kill Cedric."

23
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.192
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

24
00:01:58.328 --> 00:01:59.244
Shut up.

25
00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:01.913
"He's going to kill me, Mum."

26
00:02:02.907 --> 00:02:04.207
Where is your mum?

27
00:02:05.997 --> 00:02:07.653
Where is your mum, Potter?

28
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.018
She dead?

29
00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:12.945
Is she dead?

30
00:02:14.423 --> 00:02:15.524
Is she a dead Pott...?

31
00:02:29.422 --> 00:02:31.226
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

32
00:02:32.182 --> 00:02:33.926
- Come on.
- Come on, Dudley, let's go.

33
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.273
What's going on?

34
00:02:35.357 --> 00:02:37.313
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

35
00:02:37.397 --> 00:02:38.565
We're getting out of here, Dudley.

36
00:02:39.615 --> 00:02:41.020
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

37
00:03:31.475 --> 00:03:32.854
Dudley, run.

38
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.479
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

39
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.520
Mrs. Figg.

40
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.980
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

41
00:04:48.377 --> 00:04:49.850
They might come back.

42
00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:54.968
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

43
00:04:55.052 --> 00:04:57.218
Whole world's gone Topsy-turvy.

44
00:04:57.302 --> 00:04:59.114
I don't understand.
How do you know about...?

45
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.533
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.

46
00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:02.811
Dumbledore asked you?

47
00:05:02.895 --> 00:05:04.145
You know Dumbledore?

48
00:05:05.112 --> 00:05:09.150
After You-Know-Who killed
that poor Diggory boy last year,

49
00:05:09.234 --> 00:05:11.837
did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

50
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.097
Good Lord, boy.

51
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.734
They told me you were intelligent.

52
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.760
Now, get inside and stay there.

53
00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:19.590
Expect someone will be in touch soon.

54
00:05:19.674 --> 00:05:21.842
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

55
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.742
<i>It is hot.
That's right, hot everywhere.</i>

56
00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:36.136
<i>There's sweat. There's stifling.</i>

57
00:05:37.107 --> 00:05:38.189
Diddykins?

58
00:05:39.158 --> 00:05:40.447
Is that you?

59
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.701
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

60
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.987
We're going to have to take him
to a hospital.

61
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.265
Who did this to you, boy?

62
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.420
Happy, are we, now?

63
00:06:00.768 --> 00:06:02.043
You've finally done it.

64
00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:03.414
You've finally driven him loopy.

65
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.675
Vernon, don't say that.

66
00:06:06.454 --> 00:06:08.593
Well, just look at him, Petunia.

67
00:06:08.676 --> 00:06:10.446
Our boy has gone yumpy.

68
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.634
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

69
00:06:13.412 --> 00:06:16.861
This is the last I'm gonna take of you
and your nonsense.

70
00:06:31.172 --> 00:06:33.268
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

71
00:06:33.352 --> 00:06:35.848
The Ministry has received intelligence...

72
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.393
...that at 6:23 this evening,

73
00:06:38.914 --> 00:06:43.351
you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

74
00:06:43.878 --> 00:06:45.918
As a clear violation...

75
00:06:46.002 --> 00:06:50.171
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery,

76
00:06:50.255 --> 00:06:52.781
...you are hereby expelled...

77
00:06:52.906 --> 00:06:55.843
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

78
00:06:56.992 --> 00:06:58.648
Hoping you are well.

79
00:06:58.732 --> 00:06:59.963
Mafalda Hopkirk.

80
00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:06.903
Justice.

81
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.746
He's not very well.

82
00:07:34.873 --> 00:07:36.000
Sorry, Hedwig.

83
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.800
Very clean, these Muggles.

84
00:08:45.884 --> 00:08:47.752
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

85
00:08:52.822 --> 00:08:53.995
Professor Moody.

86
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.895
What are you doing here?

87
00:08:55.978 --> 00:08:57.354
Rescuing you, of course.

88
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.600
But where are we going?

89
00:09:01.683 --> 00:09:03.494
The letter said that I've been expelled
from Hogwarts.

90
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.190
You haven't been. Not yet.

91
00:09:05.274 --> 00:09:06.278
Kingsley, you take point.

92
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.267
But the letter said...

93
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.927
Dumbledore has persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

94
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.412
...pending a formal hearing.

95
00:09:11.495 --> 00:09:12.682
- A hearing?
- Uh-huh.

96
00:09:12.766 --> 00:09:13.627
Don't worry, Harry.

97
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.120
We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

98
00:09:16.503 --> 00:09:17.966
Not here, Nymphadora.

99
00:09:18.956 --> 00:09:21.791
Don't call me Nymphadora.

100
00:09:28.169 --> 00:09:29.557
Stay in formation, everyone.

101
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.946
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

102
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.621
Come on, around the corner.

103
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.235
Come on.

104
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.151
In you go, son.

105
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.770
There have been no sightings.

106
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.334
No deaths. No proof.

107
00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:16.808
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...

108
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.907
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

109
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.600
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

110
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.537
Was he able to protect Harry last year?

111
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.288
Well, tonight
I say it's time to take action.

112
00:11:30.372 --> 00:11:33.460
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.

113
00:11:33.547 --> 00:11:35.284
His instinct would be to ignore it...

114
00:11:35.368 --> 00:11:37.031
Keep your voices down.

115
00:11:37.114 --> 00:11:39.272
He's getting stronger
and stronger by the minute.

116
00:11:39.356 --> 00:11:40.779
We have to act now.

117
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.375
Harry.

118
00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:47.776
Mrs. Weasley.

119
00:11:50.388 --> 00:11:51.853
Heavens, you're all right.

120
00:11:56.518 --> 00:11:57.499
Bit peaky,

121
00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.892
but I'm afraid dinner will have to wait
until after the meeting's finished.

122
00:11:59.975 --> 00:12:01.212
- Well, I'm...
- Nope.

123
00:12:01.296 --> 00:12:02.625
No time to explain.

124
00:12:02.708 --> 00:12:04.446
Straight upstairs,
first door on the left.

125
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.669
Yeah.

126
00:12:09.557 --> 00:12:13.660
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

127
00:12:14.645 --> 00:12:19.023
If my poor mistress knew the scum
they let into her house...

128
00:12:19.964 --> 00:12:22.219
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

129
00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.815
Oh, the shame.

130
00:12:38.828 --> 00:12:39.768
Freaks.

131
00:12:39.852 --> 00:12:41.738
There, there, mistress.

132
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.424
Scum of the earth.

133
00:12:43.508 --> 00:12:45.042
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.

134
00:12:45.126 --> 00:12:46.316
Kreacher is here.

135
00:12:51.655 --> 00:12:52.659
Harry.

136
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.902
Are you all right?

137
00:12:57.649 --> 00:12:59.478
We overheard them talking
about the Dementor attack.

138
00:13:00.067 --> 00:13:01.311
You must tell us everything.

139
00:13:01.396 --> 00:13:02.989
Let the man breathe, Hermione.

140
00:13:03.072 --> 00:13:04.492
And this hearing at the Ministry.

141
00:13:05.475 --> 00:13:06.769
It's just outrageous.

142
00:13:07.409 --> 00:13:09.172
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

143
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.511
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

144
00:13:13.036 --> 00:13:14.747
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

145
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.709
So, what is this place?

146
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.704
It's headquarters.

147
00:13:21.184 --> 00:13:22.339
Of the Order of the Phoenix.

148
00:13:23.105 --> 00:13:24.377
It's a secret society.

149
00:13:24.873 --> 00:13:26.952
Dumbledore formed it back
when they fought You-Know-Who.

150
00:13:27.355 --> 00:13:29.177
Couldn't have put
any of this in a letter, I suppose?

151
00:13:30.832 --> 00:13:32.601
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

152
00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:34.594
We wanted to write, mate.

153
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.226
Really, we did.

154
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.418
- Only...
- Only what?

155
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.455
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

156
00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:44.866
Dumbledore said that?

157
00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:48.452
But why would he keep me in the dark?

158
00:13:48.535 --> 00:13:49.864
Maybe I could help.

159
00:13:49.947 --> 00:13:52.157
After all, I'm the one
who saw Voldemort return.

160
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.178
I'm the one who fought him.

161
00:13:53.262 --> 00:13:55.041
I'm the one who saw Cedric Diggory
get killed.

162
00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:56.103
Harry.

163
00:13:56.187 --> 00:13:57.285
Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

164
00:13:57.368 --> 00:13:58.796
Don't bottle it up, though, mate.

165
00:13:59.294 --> 00:14:00.141
Let it out.

166
00:14:00.224 --> 00:14:01.750
Anyway, if you're all done shouting...

167
00:14:01.834 --> 00:14:03.772
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

168
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.926
If anyone has a right
to know, it's Harry.

169
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.887
If it wasn't for Harry, we wouldn't
even know Voldemort was back.

170
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.790
<i>He's not a child, Molly.</i>

171
00:14:12.873 --> 00:14:15.500
<i>But he's not an adult either.</i>

172
00:14:15.584 --> 00:14:17.288
<i>He's not James, Sirius.</i>

173
00:14:17.372 --> 00:14:18.589
<i>Well, he's not your son.</i>

174
00:14:18.673 --> 00:14:19.890
<i>He's as good as.</i>

175
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.024
- <i>Who else has he got?</i>
- Hey, Ginny.

176
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.043
<i>He's got me.</i>

177
00:14:24.127 --> 00:14:25.624
<i>How touchingly paternal, Black.</i>

178
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.899
Perhaps Potter will grow up
to be a felon, just like his godfather.

179
00:14:28.982 --> 00:14:30.779
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

180
00:14:30.863 --> 00:14:32.980
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

181
00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:35.031
...about your supposed reformation.

182
00:14:35.114 --> 00:14:36.368
I know better.

183
00:14:36.452 --> 00:14:38.004
<i>So why don't you tell him?</i>

184
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.790
- Get off it.
- Quick.

185
00:14:39.888 --> 00:14:41.644
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

186
00:14:42.094 --> 00:14:43.766
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

187
00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:46.681
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

188
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.987
Hermione, I hate your cat.

189
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.324
Bad Crookshanks.

190
00:14:53.287 --> 00:14:56.065
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.

191
00:14:57.468 --> 00:14:59.607
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

192
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.679
...does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.

193
00:15:02.763 --> 00:15:03.779
Hi, Mum.

194
00:15:05.429 --> 00:15:06.562
You hungry, Harry?

195
00:15:07.167 --> 00:15:08.348
You sure you're all right, Harry?

196
00:15:08.432 --> 00:15:09.964
Gave us quite a turn.

197
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.305
Harry Potter.

198
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.648
Sirius.

199
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.312
This is very, very peculiar.

200
00:15:24.396 --> 00:15:28.005
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

201
00:15:28.088 --> 00:15:28.831
I don't understand.

202
00:15:28.914 --> 00:15:30.785
What has the Ministry of Magic
got against me?

203
00:15:32.568 --> 00:15:33.436
Show him.

204
00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:35.523
He'll find out soon enough.

205
00:15:46.359 --> 00:15:48.660
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

206
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.250
Fudge is using all his power,

207
00:15:53.333 --> 00:15:55.995
including his influence
at the "Daily Prophet" to...

208
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.624
...smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

209
00:15:59.707 --> 00:16:00.683
Why?

210
00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:03.132
The Minister thinks
Dumbledore's after his job.

211
00:16:03.215 --> 00:16:03.937
But that's insane.

212
00:16:04.043 --> 00:16:05.651
No one in their right mind
could believe that Dumbledore...

213
00:16:05.734 --> 00:16:07.027
Exactly the point.

214
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.594
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

215
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.096
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

216
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.464
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

217
00:16:15.547 --> 00:16:17.968
The last time Voldemort gained power,

218
00:16:18.052 --> 00:16:21.110
he almost destroyed everything
we hold most dear.

219
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.827
Now he's returned,

220
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.410
and I'm afraid the minister
will do almost anything...

221
00:16:25.494 --> 00:16:28.742
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

222
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.569
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

223
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:36.675
Fourteen years ago,

224
00:16:36.758 --> 00:16:38.210
he had huge numbers at his command.

225
00:16:38.294 --> 00:16:40.298
And not just witches and wizards,

226
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.069
but all manner of dark creatures.

227
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.339
He's been recruiting heavily,

228
00:16:45.424 --> 00:16:47.328
and we've been attempting to do the same.

229
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.545
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

230
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.439
We believe...

231
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.222
...Voldemort may be after something.

232
00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:01.503
Sirius.

233
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:07.147
Something he didn't have last time.

234
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.468
You mean like a weapon?

235
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.034
No. That's enough.

236
00:17:13.118 --> 00:17:15.235
He's just a boy.

237
00:17:15.944 --> 00:17:17.182
You say much more
and you might as well...

238
00:17:17.267 --> 00:17:18.591
...induct him into the Order
straight away.

239
00:17:18.674 --> 00:17:19.860
Good. I want to join.

240
00:17:20.217 --> 00:17:22.128
If Voldemort's raising an army,
then I want to fight.

241
00:17:35.043 --> 00:17:37.255
<i>Harry.</i>

242
00:17:37.338 --> 00:17:39.472
<i>You are hereby expelled.</i>

243
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.293
<i>Before the entire Wizengamot.</i>

244
00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:53.718
Trains. Underground.

245
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.307
Ingenious, these Muggles.

246
00:18:13.244 --> 00:18:14.412
Here we are.

247
00:18:16.873 --> 00:18:19.211
I've never used
the visitors' entrance before.

248
00:18:19.294 --> 00:18:20.421
Should be fun.

249
00:18:22.147 --> 00:18:23.078
Right. Good.

250
00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:25.411
I'll just get my Muggle money.

251
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.721
Terrible day yesterday.

252
00:19:07.804 --> 00:19:09.352
Lost a lot of Galleons trading
on the potions market.

253
00:19:09.435 --> 00:19:11.003
"Daily Prophet", ladies and gentlemen.

254
00:19:11.086 --> 00:19:12.744
Anybody for "Daily Prophet"?

255
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.074
Dumbledore.
Is he daft, or is he dangerous?

256
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:39.906
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

257
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.059
Interdepartmental memos.

258
00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:46.665
We used to use owls.

259
00:19:46.748 --> 00:19:48.219
Mess was unbelievable.

260
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.260
Merlin's beard.

261
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.904
Thank you, Kingsley.

262
00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.330
They've changed the time of your hearing.

263
00:19:59.413 --> 00:20:00.496
When is it?

264
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.622
In five minutes.

265
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.459
<i>Department of Mysteries.</i>

266
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.967
And I'm confident, Minister,
that you will do the right thing.

267
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.594
Yes, but we must be...

268
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.091
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

269
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.871
Keep calm.

270
00:20:35.337 --> 00:20:36.831
You've done nothing wrong.

271
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.995
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

272
00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:42.621
Yes?

273
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.730
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

274
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.196
Good luck, Harry.

275
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.325
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

276
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.464
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

277
00:20:59.547 --> 00:21:03.158
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

278
00:21:03.264 --> 00:21:06.365
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag...

279
00:21:06.449 --> 00:21:08.571
Witness for the defense.

280
00:21:08.654 --> 00:21:11.138
Albus Percival Wulfric...

281
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.653
...Brian Dumbledore.

282
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.304
You got our message that the time
and place of the hearing...

283
00:21:19.388 --> 00:21:20.499
...had been changed, did you?

284
00:21:20.582 --> 00:21:21.874
I must have missed it.

285
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.636
But by a happy mistake,

286
00:21:23.719 --> 00:21:25.984
I arrived at the Ministry
three hours early.

287
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:29.835
The charges?

288
00:21:29.918 --> 00:21:32.873
The charges against the accused
are as follows.

289
00:21:32.956 --> 00:21:34.630
"That he did knowingly..."

290
00:21:34.713 --> 00:21:38.444
"...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions..."

291
00:21:38.527 --> 00:21:41.470
"...produce a Patronus Charm..."

292
00:21:41.732 --> 00:21:43.920
"...in the presence of a Muggle."

293
00:21:44.942 --> 00:21:48.264
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

294
00:21:48.347 --> 00:21:49.801
"And you were aware
that you were forbidden..."

295
00:21:49.877 --> 00:21:52.150
"...too use magic outside school..."

296
00:21:52.233 --> 00:21:55.069
- ...while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

297
00:21:55.152 --> 00:21:58.466
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...

298
00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.503
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

299
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:04.807
Dementors?

300
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.239
In Little Whinging?

301
00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.203
That's quite clever.

302
00:22:10.367 --> 00:22:13.133
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

303
00:22:13.855 --> 00:22:15.933
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

304
00:22:16.017 --> 00:22:17.129
There were two of them,
and if I hadn't...

305
00:22:17.213 --> 00:22:18.316
Enough.

306
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.073
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

307
00:22:23.156 --> 00:22:27.520
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

308
00:22:27.603 --> 00:22:28.749
Pardon me, Minister,

309
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.565
but as it happens, we can.

310
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.300
Please describe the attack.

311
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.131
What did they look like?

312
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.096
Well...

313
00:22:45.936 --> 00:22:49.248
one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

314
00:22:50.482 --> 00:22:53.373
Not the boys. The Dementors.

315
00:22:53.457 --> 00:22:56.719
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

316
00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.510
Cloaked.

317
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.487
Then everything went cold...

318
00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:06.883
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

319
00:23:07.209 --> 00:23:08.586
Now, look here.

320
00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.888
Dementors don't just wander
into a Muggle suburb...

321
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.983
...and happen across a wizard.

322
00:23:14.067 --> 00:23:16.299
The odds are astronomical.

323
00:23:16.382 --> 00:23:17.682
I don't think anyone would believe...

324
00:23:17.766 --> 00:23:20.204
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, Minister.

325
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.250
I'm sure I must have
misunderstood you, Professor.

326
00:23:26.684 --> 00:23:28.707
Dementors are, after all,

327
00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.177
under the control
of the Ministry of Magic.

328
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.021
And it's so silly of me, but it sounded
for a moment as though...

329
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.860
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

330
00:23:40.944 --> 00:23:43.967
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...

331
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:48.183
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

332
00:23:48.266 --> 00:23:51.421
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

333
00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.610
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

334
00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:57.352
Of course, there is someone...

335
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.355
...who might be behind the attack.

336
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.278
Cornelius,

337
00:24:06.012 --> 00:24:07.848
I implore you to see reason.

338
00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:13.184
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

339
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.888
He is not back.

340
00:24:22.248 --> 00:24:23.579
In the matter of Harry Potter,

341
00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.656
the law clearly states...

342
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:32.115
...that magic may be used before Muggles
in life-threatening situations.

343
00:24:32.523 --> 00:24:35.430
Laws can be changed
if necessary, Dumbledore.

344
00:24:35.514 --> 00:24:38.777
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

345
00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.787
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

346
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.831
Those in favor of conviction?

347
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:07.488
Those in favor of clearing
the accused of all charges?

348
00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:22.953
Cleared of all charges.

349
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.050
Professor.

350
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.852
Padfoot.

351
00:25:42.935 --> 00:25:44.229
Are you barking mad?

352
00:25:44.914 --> 00:25:46.476
You'll blow the entire operation.

353
00:25:55.775 --> 00:25:57.159
Sirius, what are you doing here?

354
00:25:57.242 --> 00:25:58.284
If somebody sees you...

355
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.174
I had to see you off, didn't I?

356
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.422
What's life without a little risk?

357
00:26:05.687 --> 00:26:07.661
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

358
00:26:07.744 --> 00:26:09.266
Don't worry about me.

359
00:26:09.974 --> 00:26:10.961
Anyway,

360
00:26:12.192 --> 00:26:14.011
I wanted you to have this.

361
00:26:20.313 --> 00:26:22.279
Original Order of the Phoenix.

362
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.999
Marlene McKinnon.

363
00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.037
She was killed two weeks
after this was taken.

364
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.878
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

365
00:26:32.219 --> 00:26:34.161
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

366
00:26:34.245 --> 00:26:35.336
Neville's parents.

367
00:26:36.007 --> 00:26:38.465
They suffered a fate
worse than death if you ask me.

368
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.149
It's been 14 years.

369
00:26:44.906 --> 00:26:48.088
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

370
00:26:53.808 --> 00:26:55.746
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

371
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.392
It feels like it did before.

372
00:27:06.372 --> 00:27:07.423
You keep it.

373
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.563
Anyway,

374
00:27:10.282 --> 00:27:12.134
I suppose you're the young ones now.

375
00:27:15.184 --> 00:27:16.294
I'll see you at the train.

376
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.313
Bye bye, darling.

377
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.186
I love you.

378
00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.642
Hold my hand, lovey.

379
00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:26.280
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

380
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.863
Bye.

381
00:28:10.236 --> 00:28:13.568
I'm surprised the Ministry's still
letting you walk around free. Potter.

382
00:28:13.652 --> 00:28:15.312
Better enjoy it while you can.

383
00:28:15.395 --> 00:28:17.710
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

384
00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.920
What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.

385
00:28:23.003 --> 00:28:24.286
Just stay away from me!

386
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.527
It's only Malfoy.

387
00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.212
What'd you expect?

388
00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:51.879
Hi, guys.

389
00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.428
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

390
00:29:06.839 --> 00:29:07.963
What is it?

391
00:29:10.576 --> 00:29:12.052
- What's what?
- That.

392
00:29:12.135 --> 00:29:13.123
Pulling the carriage.

393
00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.209
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

394
00:29:17.746 --> 00:29:19.268
It's pulling itself, like always.

395
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:34.846
You're not going mad.

396
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.652
I can see them too.

397
00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.521
You're just as sane as I am.

398
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:50.396
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

399
00:29:54.197 --> 00:29:55.309
Luna Lovegood.

400
00:30:00.033 --> 00:30:01.325
What an interesting necklace.

401
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.103
It's a charm, actually.

402
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.787
Keeps away the Nargles.

403
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.657
Hungry.

404
00:30:13.967 --> 00:30:15.116
I hope there's pudding.

405
00:30:16.996 --> 00:30:18.213
What's a Nargle?

406
00:30:18.695 --> 00:30:19.773
No idea.

407
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.659
Good evening, children.

408
00:30:36.195 --> 00:30:38.960
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

409
00:30:39.043 --> 00:30:42.110
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

410
00:30:42.194 --> 00:30:44.732
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

411
00:30:44.816 --> 00:30:47.932
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

412
00:30:49.324 --> 00:30:53.258
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

413
00:30:53.342 --> 00:30:55.823
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

414
00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.372
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

415
00:31:01.465 --> 00:31:05.857
Now, as usual, our caretaker,
Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you...

416
00:31:17.205 --> 00:31:18.403
She was at my hearing.

417
00:31:19.144 --> 00:31:20.376
She works for Fudge.

418
00:31:20.459 --> 00:31:22.558
Thank you, Headmaster,

419
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.290
for those kind words of welcome.

420
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.367
And how lovely to see all your bright,

421
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.150
happy faces smiling up at me.

422
00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:39.961
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

423
00:31:40.044 --> 00:31:41.390
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

424
00:31:45.084 --> 00:31:46.642
The Ministry of Magic...

425
00:31:46.725 --> 00:31:50.893
...has always considered the education
of young witches and wizards...

426
00:31:50.978 --> 00:31:53.354
to be of vital importance.

427
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:56.375
Although each headmaster...

428
00:31:56.458 --> 00:32:00.277
...has brought something new
to this historic school,

429
00:32:02.984 --> 00:32:08.763
progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

430
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:13.068
Let us preserve what must be preserved,

431
00:32:13.878 --> 00:32:16.891
perfect what can be perfected,

432
00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:23.022
and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

433
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.004
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.

434
00:32:33.089 --> 00:32:35.443
That really was most illuminating.

435
00:32:35.527 --> 00:32:37.951
Illuminating? What a load of waffle.

436
00:32:38.034 --> 00:32:39.201
What's it mean?

437
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.867
Magic is forbidden in the corridors.

438
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.738
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

439
00:33:06.385 --> 00:33:07.549
Dean, Seamus.

440
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.926
- Good holiday?
- All right.

441
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.545
Better than Seamus', anyway.

442
00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.180
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

443
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:17.862
Why not?

444
00:33:17.945 --> 00:33:20.054
Let me see. Because of you.

445
00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.964
The "Daily Prophet" has been saying
a lot of things about you, Harry...

446
00:33:23.047 --> 00:33:24.254
...and about Dumbledore as well.

447
00:33:24.338 --> 00:33:25.488
What, your mum believes them?

448
00:33:25.613 --> 00:33:27.647
Well, nobody was there
the night Cedric died.

449
00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.816
I guess you should read the "Prophet",
then, like your stupid mother.

450
00:33:29.899 --> 00:33:31.086
It'll tell everything you need to know.

451
00:33:31.169 --> 00:33:32.546
Don't you dare talk about my mother
like that.

452
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.448
I'll have a go at anyone
that calls me a liar.

453
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.678
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

454
00:33:37.318 --> 00:33:39.840
Do you believe the rubbish he's come out
with about You-Know-Who?

455
00:33:39.923 --> 00:33:41.205
Yeah. I do.

456
00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.673
Has anyone else got a problem with Harry?

457
00:33:54.507 --> 00:33:55.972
- You all right?
- Fine.

458
00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:58.920
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

459
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.210
But he'll come through, you'll see.

460
00:34:02.294 --> 00:34:03.489
I said, I'm fine, Ron.

461
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.040
Right.

462
00:34:09.768 --> 00:34:11.391
I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

463
00:34:40.688 --> 00:34:41.863
<i>Harry.</i>

464
00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.420
Bring it over here. Over here.

465
00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.303
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

466
00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.318
Good morning, children.

467
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:26.878
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

468
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:30.364
O-W-Ls.

469
00:35:30.447 --> 00:35:34.337
More commonly known as OWLs.

470
00:35:35.108 --> 00:35:38.220
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

471
00:35:38.629 --> 00:35:42.889
Fail to do so, and the consequences
may be severe.

472
00:35:49.386 --> 00:35:54.237
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

473
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.719
But you'll be pleased to know,

474
00:35:55.802 --> 00:35:59.180
from now on, you will be following
a carefully structured...

475
00:35:59.265 --> 00:36:02.480
...Ministry-approved course
of defensive magic.

476
00:36:02.564 --> 00:36:03.420
Yes?

477
00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.726
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

478
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:07.910
Using spells?

479
00:36:09.207 --> 00:36:12.590
Well, I can't imagine why you would need
to use spells in my classroom.

480
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:15.328
We're not gonna use magic?

481
00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:20.703
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.

482
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:21.975
What use is that?

483
00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.945
If we're gonna be attacked,
it won't be risk-free.

484
00:36:24.029 --> 00:36:26.814
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

485
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:33.340
It is the view of the Ministry...

486
00:36:33.423 --> 00:36:36.090
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

487
00:36:36.145 --> 00:36:38.198
...to get you through your examinations...

488
00:36:38.282 --> 00:36:40.924
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.

489
00:36:41.008 --> 00:36:43.790
And how's theory supposed
to prepare us for what's out there?

490
00:36:43.854 --> 00:36:45.870
There is nothing out there, dear.

491
00:36:46.327 --> 00:36:49.403
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

492
00:36:49.802 --> 00:36:52.432
I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

493
00:37:03.402 --> 00:37:06.673
Now, let me make this quite plain.

494
00:37:08.444 --> 00:37:09.942
You have been told...

495
00:37:10.025 --> 00:37:12.892
...that a certain dark wizard...

496
00:37:12.975 --> 00:37:15.078
...is at large once again.

497
00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:18.847
This is a lie.

498
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:20.893
It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

499
00:37:20.976 --> 00:37:22.291
Detention, Mr. Potter.

500
00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:24.816
So according to you, Cedric Diggory
dropped dead of his own accord?

501
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.602
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

502
00:37:27.685 --> 00:37:29.813
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.
You must know that!

503
00:37:29.897 --> 00:37:30.901
Enough!

504
00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.112
Enough.

505
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.592
See me later, Mr. Potter.

506
00:37:36.529 --> 00:37:37.532
My office.

507
00:38:03.026 --> 00:38:04.170
Come in.

508
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.737
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

509
00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:13.062
Sit.

510
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.568
You're going to be doing
some lines for me today, Mr. Potter.

511
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.661
No, not with your quill.

512
00:38:27.219 --> 00:38:29.211
Going to be using a rather
special one of mine.

513
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.685
Now...

514
00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.036
...I want you to write...

515
00:38:40.373 --> 00:38:43.268
"I must not tell lies."

516
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.013
How many times?

517
00:38:48.176 --> 00:38:51.770
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

518
00:38:54.858 --> 00:38:56.168
You haven't given me any ink.

519
00:38:56.754 --> 00:38:58.120
You won't need any ink.

520
00:39:49.477 --> 00:39:50.880
Yes?

521
00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.316
Nothing.

522
00:39:59.794 --> 00:40:00.820
That's right.

523
00:40:02.545 --> 00:40:04.345
Because you know,

524
00:40:04.428 --> 00:40:05.635
deep down,

525
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.349
you deserve to be punished.

526
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.134
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

527
00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.298
Go on.

528
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.274
Skiving Snackboxes.

529
00:40:28.358 --> 00:40:29.374
Sweets that make you ill.

530
00:40:29.458 --> 00:40:31.108
Get out of class whenever you like.

531
00:40:31.192 --> 00:40:34.002
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

532
00:40:36.158 --> 00:40:37.323
Care for another?

533
00:40:37.407 --> 00:40:39.047
I'm not asking you
to write all of it for me.

534
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:43.046
Please, I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

535
00:40:43.617 --> 00:40:45.467
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

536
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:48.955
Hermione, you're honestly
the most wonderful person I've ever met.

537
00:40:49.566 --> 00:40:51.395
And if I'm ever rude to you again...

538
00:40:51.479 --> 00:40:52.796
I'll know you've gone back to normal.

539
00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.917
What's wrong with your hand?

540
00:41:01.414 --> 00:41:02.468
Nothing.

541
00:41:04.325 --> 00:41:05.305
The other hand.

542
00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:09.889
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

543
00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.167
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

544
00:41:12.934 --> 00:41:14.959
Anyway, I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

545
00:41:15.042 --> 00:41:17.213
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

546
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:18.978
If the parents knew about this...

547
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.877
Yeah, well, I haven't got
any of those, have I, Ron?

548
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.179
Harry, you've got to report this.

549
00:41:27.097 --> 00:41:28.397
It's perfectly simple. You're being...

550
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.764
No, it's not.

551
00:41:30.793 --> 00:41:33.208
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.

552
00:41:34.882 --> 00:41:36.081
You don't understand.

553
00:41:39.465 --> 00:41:40.618
Then help us to.

554
00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:57.151
<i>Dear Padfoot...</i>

555
00:41:58.559 --> 00:41:59.727
<i>...I hope you're all right.</i>

556
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:01.824
<i>It's starting to get colder here.</i>

557
00:42:02.527 --> 00:42:04.154
<i>Winter is definitely on the way.</i>

558
00:42:07.666 --> 00:42:11.346
<i>In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.</i>

559
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.809
<i>I know you, of all people,
will understand.</i>

560
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.826
Hello, Harry Potter.

561
00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.598
Your feet.

562
00:42:56.965 --> 00:42:58.083
Aren't they cold?

563
00:42:58.662 --> 00:42:59.670
A bit.

564
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.949
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

565
00:43:05.806 --> 00:43:07.717
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

566
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:16.266
What are they?

567
00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:17.842
They're called Thestrals.

568
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.495
They're quite gentle, really, but...

569
00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:23.954
...people avoid them
because they're a bit...

570
00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:28.294
Different.

571
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.574
But why can't the others see them?

572
00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.061
They can only be seen by people
who've seen death.

573
00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.636
So you've known someone who's died, then?

574
00:43:43.127 --> 00:43:44.249
My mum.

575
00:43:45.246 --> 00:43:47.320
She was quite an extraordinary witch,

576
00:43:47.404 --> 00:43:49.564
but she did like to experiment...

577
00:43:49.647 --> 00:43:52.707
...and one day, one of her spells
went badly wrong.

578
00:43:53.787 --> 00:43:54.774
I was 9.

579
00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:56.616
I'm sorry.

580
00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.081
Yes, it was rather horrible.

581
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.478
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,

582
00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:03.542
but I've got Dad.

583
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.350
We both believe you, by the way.

584
00:44:12.409 --> 00:44:14.447
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back,

585
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:15.506
and you fought him,

586
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:16.709
and the Ministry and the "Prophet"...

587
00:44:16.793 --> 00:44:18.906
...are conspiring against you
and Dumbledore.

588
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.889
Thanks.

589
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.373
It seems you're about the only ones
that do.

590
00:44:23.447 --> 00:44:24.701
I don't think that's true.

591
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:29.473
But I suppose that's how
he wants you to feel.

592
00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.707
What do you mean?

593
00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.401
Well, if I were You-Know-Who,

594
00:44:35.152 --> 00:44:37.764
I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

595
00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:40.739
...because if it's just you alone,

596
00:44:42.462 --> 00:44:43.878
you're not as much of a threat.

597
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.184
Do you ever stop eating?6

598
00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:06.371
What? I'm hungry.

599
00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.540
Harry.

600
00:45:13.416 --> 00:45:14.484
Can I join you?

601
00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.616
Pardon me, Professor,

602
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.677
but what exactly are you insinuating?

603
00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.767
I am merely requesting that
when it comes to my students,

604
00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:26.505
you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

605
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.005
So silly of me, but it sounds...

606
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:32.504
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

607
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.563
...Minerva.

608
00:45:34.646 --> 00:45:36.665
Not at all, Dolores,

609
00:45:37.122 --> 00:45:39.286
merely your medieval methods.

610
00:45:40.658 --> 00:45:42.153
I'm sorry, dear.

611
00:45:42.236 --> 00:45:45.540
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry.

612
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:48.429
And by extension, the minister himself.

613
00:45:49.087 --> 00:45:50.769
I am a tolerant woman...

614
00:45:50.853 --> 00:45:54.884
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

615
00:45:57.709 --> 00:45:58.842
Disloyalty.

616
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:04.377
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

617
00:46:05.305 --> 00:46:07.924
Cornelius will want to take
immediate action.

618
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:21.568
What's happened to Dumbledore?

619
00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.920
Having already revolutionized...

620
00:46:25.003 --> 00:46:27.899
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts,

621
00:46:28.294 --> 00:46:32.545
Dolores Umbridge will,
as High Inquisitor,

622
00:46:32.628 --> 00:46:34.295
have powers...

623
00:46:34.379 --> 00:46:39.365
...to address the seriously
falling standards at Hogwarts School.

624
00:46:47.128 --> 00:46:48.820
Just one question, dear.

625
00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:53.264
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?

626
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.890
You applied first for the Defense
Against the Dark Arts post,

627
00:47:03.973 --> 00:47:05.039
is that correct?

628
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.363
Yes.

629
00:47:08.334 --> 00:47:09.999
But you were unsuccessful?

630
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:13.641
Obviously.

631
00:47:46.553 --> 00:47:49.725
Could you please predict something for me?

632
00:47:52.076 --> 00:47:53.244
I'm sorry?

633
00:47:58.544 --> 00:47:59.737
Move those mouths.

634
00:48:06.665 --> 00:48:09.141
One teensy little prophecy?

635
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:16.818
Pity.

636
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:20.302
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.

637
00:48:20.385 --> 00:48:22.371
Yes, I do. Something dark.

638
00:48:22.853 --> 00:48:26.759
You are in grave danger.

639
00:48:28.936 --> 00:48:29.965
Lovely.

640
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.439
Cho. What's going on?

641
00:48:43.117 --> 00:48:44.643
It's Professor Trelawney.

642
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:18.200
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.

643
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.002
Hogwarts is my home.

644
00:49:23.889 --> 00:49:25.086
You can't do this.

645
00:49:27.165 --> 00:49:28.551
Actually, I can.

646
00:49:35.319 --> 00:49:36.698
Minerva, I'm...

647
00:49:38.196 --> 00:49:39.571
Something you'd like to say, dear?

648
00:49:39.655 --> 00:49:42.410
There are several things
I would like to say.

649
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:44.029
There...

650
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:59.536
Professor McGonagall,

651
00:50:00.453 --> 00:50:02.873
might I ask you to escort Sybil
back inside?

652
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.472
Sybil, dear. This way.

653
00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.306
Thank you.

654
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:10.924
Dumbledore,

655
00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:12.183
may I remind you...

656
00:50:13.278 --> 00:50:15.918
...that under the terms
of Educational Decree Number 23,

657
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.382
as enacted by the minister...

658
00:50:17.465 --> 00:50:19.706
You have the right to dismiss my teachers.

659
00:50:20.753 --> 00:50:23.859
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

660
00:50:24.527 --> 00:50:26.504
That power remains with the headmaster.

661
00:50:29.567 --> 00:50:30.526
For now.

662
00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:38.644
Don't you all have studying to do?

663
00:50:39.477 --> 00:50:40.540
Professor.

664
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.296
Professor?

665
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:46.177
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

666
00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.231
Professor Dumbledore.

667
00:50:59.687 --> 00:51:01.539
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

668
00:51:02.469 --> 00:51:04.583
We're not learning
how to defend ourselves.

669
00:51:04.666 --> 00:51:06.512
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

670
00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:09.805
She's taking over the entire school.

671
00:51:09.888 --> 00:51:14.769
<i>Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.</i>

672
00:51:14.853 --> 00:51:17.608
<i>Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...</i>

673
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:19.973
<i>...that these disappearances
are the work...</i>

674
00:51:20.056 --> 00:51:24.250
<i>...of notorious mass murderer
Sirius Black.</i>

675
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:26.072
Harry.

676
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:27.789
Sirius.

677
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:30.243
What are you doing here?

678
00:51:30.326 --> 00:51:31.659
Answering your letter.

679
00:51:32.018 --> 00:51:33.844
You said you were worried about Umbridge.

680
00:51:33.928 --> 00:51:35.137
What's she doing?

681
00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.139
Training you to kill half-breeds?

682
00:51:37.222 --> 00:51:38.880
Sirius, she's not letting us
use magic at all.

683
00:51:38.964 --> 00:51:40.603
Well, I'm not surprised.

684
00:51:40.686 --> 00:51:44.793
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

685
00:51:44.876 --> 00:51:45.830
Combat?

686
00:51:46.453 --> 00:51:48.734
What does he think, we're forming
some sort of wizard army?

687
00:51:48.819 --> 00:51:50.159
Well, that's exactly what he thinks.

688
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:54.465
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

689
00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:57.751
He's becoming more paranoid by the minute.

690
00:51:58.959 --> 00:52:02.462
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

691
00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:05.596
...but things aren't going
at all well with the Order.

692
00:52:06.279 --> 00:52:08.111
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

693
00:52:08.194 --> 00:52:12.240
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

694
00:52:13.773 --> 00:52:16.299
Voldemort is on the move.

695
00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.880
Well, what can we do?

696
00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.599
Someone's coming.

697
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.705
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

698
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:24.555
But for now, at least,

699
00:52:25.565 --> 00:52:27.500
it looks like you're on your own.

700
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.447
He really is out there, isn't he?

701
00:52:44.279 --> 00:52:46.076
We've got to be able to defend ourselves.

702
00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:50.276
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,
we need someone who will.

703
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:09.823
<i>Harry.</i>

704
00:53:20.019 --> 00:53:21.301
This is mad.

705
00:53:21.384 --> 00:53:22.394
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

706
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.797
I'm a nutter, remember?

707
00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:24.864
Look on the bright side.

708
00:53:25.573 --> 00:53:27.314
You can't be any worse
than old toad face.

709
00:53:28.752 --> 00:53:29.773
Thanks, Ron.

710
00:53:30.166 --> 00:53:31.315
I'm here for you, mate.

711
00:53:32.698 --> 00:53:33.970
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

712
00:53:35.155 --> 00:53:36.531
Just a couple of people.

713
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:43.128
Lovely spot.

714
00:53:47.508 --> 00:53:49.562
Thought it would be safer
some off the beaten track.

715
00:53:49.646 --> 00:53:50.908
Matey, come back here.

716
00:54:00.356 --> 00:54:01.240
Hi.

717
00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:04.571
So you all know why we're here.

718
00:54:04.957 --> 00:54:06.150
We need a teacher.

719
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:09.026
A proper teacher.

720
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:11.566
One who's had real experience...

721
00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:13.496
...defending themselves
against the Dark Arts.

722
00:54:13.579 --> 00:54:14.763
- Why?
- Why?

723
00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.628
Because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot.

724
00:54:17.713 --> 00:54:19.443
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

725
00:54:19.526 --> 00:54:21.393
So Dumbledore says because he says.

726
00:54:21.716 --> 00:54:23.376
The point is, where's the proof?

727
00:54:25.852 --> 00:54:28.670
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

728
00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:33.168
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric,

729
00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:35.349
so if that's why you're here,
you must all clear out now.

730
00:54:35.637 --> 00:54:36.649
Come on, Hermione. Let's go.

731
00:54:36.733 --> 00:54:38.235
They're here because they think
I'm some sort of freak.

732
00:54:38.319 --> 00:54:39.155
Harry, wait.

733
00:54:39.239 --> 00:54:41.371
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

734
00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.146
Yes.

735
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:49.353
I've seen it.

736
00:54:49.949 --> 00:54:51.890
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

737
00:54:52.429 --> 00:54:54.189
And he killed a basilisk,

738
00:54:55.034 --> 00:54:56.748
with the sword in Dumbledore's office.

739
00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:57.705
It's true.

740
00:54:57.789 --> 00:55:00.265
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

741
00:55:02.636 --> 00:55:05.140
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

742
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:06.173
Wait.

743
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.450
Look...

744
00:55:09.014 --> 00:55:11.879
It all sounds great
when you say it like that...

745
00:55:11.963 --> 00:55:14.677
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

746
00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.365
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time.

747
00:55:17.449 --> 00:55:18.691
I nearly always had help.

748
00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.295
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

749
00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:28.193
Facing this stuff in real life...

750
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:30.046
...is not like school.

751
00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.448
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

752
00:55:34.532 --> 00:55:36.107
But out there...

753
00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:40.731
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

754
00:55:40.815 --> 00:55:43.540
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

755
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:48.327
You don't know what that's like.

756
00:55:58.436 --> 00:55:59.767
You're right, Harry, we don't.

757
00:56:01.592 --> 00:56:02.776
That's why we need your help.

758
00:56:03.757 --> 00:56:05.603
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

759
00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:10.015
...Voldemort...

760
00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.493
He's really back.

761
00:56:36.645 --> 00:56:37.538
Right.

762
00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:39.303
First we need to find a place
to practice...

763
00:56:39.387 --> 00:56:40.609
...where Umbridge won't find out.

764
00:56:40.693 --> 00:56:42.503
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

765
00:56:43.272 --> 00:56:44.380
Forbidden Forest?

766
00:56:44.464 --> 00:56:45.737
Not bloody likely.

767
00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.394
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

768
00:56:48.478 --> 00:56:49.504
Who cares?

769
00:56:50.482 --> 00:56:54.718
I mean, it's sort of exciting,
isn't it, breaking the rules?

770
00:56:55.462 --> 00:56:57.755
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione Granger?

771
00:56:58.446 --> 00:56:59.315
Anyway,

772
00:56:59.398 --> 00:57:01.618
at least we know one positive thing
that came from today.

773
00:57:02.258 --> 00:57:03.375
What's that?

774
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:06.908
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

775
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:11.706
Right.

776
00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:12.852
Over the next few days,

777
00:57:12.936 --> 00:57:13.858
we should each come up...

778
00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:16.584
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

779
00:57:17.079 --> 00:57:18.677
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,

780
00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.353
there's no chance she can find us.

781
00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.083
Will do, Harry.

782
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:35.495
<i>All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.</i>

783
00:57:35.874 --> 00:57:39.544
<i>Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.</i>

784
00:57:39.627 --> 00:57:41.270
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

785
00:58:17.883 --> 00:58:18.969
You've done it, Neville.

786
00:58:19.772 --> 00:58:21.169
You found the Room of Requirement.

787
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:23.539
The what?

788
00:58:23.623 --> 00:58:25.325
It's also known as the Come and Go Room.

789
00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.986
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

790
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:31.742
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

791
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.335
So say you really needed the toilet...

792
00:58:37.458 --> 00:58:38.509
Charming, Ronald.

793
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:42.447
But, yes, that is the general idea.

794
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:43.559
It's brilliant.

795
00:58:44.227 --> 00:58:46.233
It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

796
00:58:58.378 --> 00:58:59.561
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

797
00:59:05.059 --> 00:59:06.083
I'm hopeless.

798
00:59:06.166 --> 00:59:08.713
You're just flourishing
your wand too much.

799
00:59:08.796 --> 00:59:09.721
Try it like this.

800
00:59:09.805 --> 00:59:10.642
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

801
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:17.953
You will please copy
the approved text four times...

802
00:59:18.036 --> 00:59:20.760
...to ensure maximum retention.

803
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:22.999
There will be no need to talk.

804
00:59:23.083 --> 00:59:24.999
No need to think's more like it.

805
00:59:25.083 --> 00:59:26.072
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

806
00:59:26.156 --> 00:59:27.412
Wands away.

807
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:42.726
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

808
00:59:42.809 --> 00:59:44.860
It's sort of a wizard's
bread and butter, really.

809
00:59:44.944 --> 00:59:46.661
So come on, then, Nigel.

810
00:59:47.786 --> 00:59:49.118
Give it your best shot.

811
00:59:55.562 --> 00:59:56.770
<i>Stupefy!</i>

812
01:00:02.025 --> 01:00:02.910
Good.

813
01:00:02.994 --> 01:00:05.715
Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

814
01:00:11.895 --> 01:00:14.075
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

815
01:00:14.466 --> 01:00:15.529
Thanks, Ronald.

816
01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:20.360
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

817
01:00:21.013 --> 01:00:23.554
- Come on, Ron. You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

818
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:26.487
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

819
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:35.310
<i>Stupefy.</i>

820
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:42.895
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

821
01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.684
I let her do that.

822
01:00:45.644 --> 01:00:47.279
It's good manners, isn't it?

823
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.136
It was completely intentional.

824
01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.845
Up you come.

825
01:01:19.929 --> 01:01:21.374
Would you like a cup of tea?

826
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.690
Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.

827
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:29.211
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

828
01:01:31.779 --> 01:01:33.384
Very good. Keep your concentration.

829
01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.272
Great.

830
01:01:39.022 --> 01:01:40.154
A little higher.

831
01:01:49.135 --> 01:01:51.263
I'm okay. I'm okay.

832
01:02:09.982 --> 01:02:12.670
<i>- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.</i>

833
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.537
<i>Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad...</i>

834
01:02:16.622 --> 01:02:17.694
<i>...for extra credit...</i>

<i>...may sign up

<i>Diminuendo.</i>

837
01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.431
Working hard is important,

838
01:02:30.514 --> 01:02:32.831
but there's something
that matters even more.

839
01:02:32.914 --> 01:02:34.202
Believing in yourself.

840
01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.180
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

841
01:02:36.263 --> 01:02:37.496
<i>Levicorpus.</i> Got it.

842
01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.689
Think of it this way.

843
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.271
Every great wizard in history
has started out...

844
01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.588
...as nothing more than what we are now.

845
01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.016
Students.

846
01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:50.256
If they can do it, why not us?

847
01:03:00.167 --> 01:03:01.072
<i>Stupefy.</i>

848
01:03:01.157 --> 01:03:02.370
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

849
01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.564
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

850
01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:09.735
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

851
01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:17.110

852
01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:31.920

<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

856
01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:48.485
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, mate.

857
01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:53.140
So that's it for this lesson.

858
01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:55.732
Now, we're not gonna be meeting
again until after the holidays.

859
01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.388
So just keep practicing
on your own as best you can.

860
01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:01.452
And well done, everyone.

861
01:04:01.536 --> 01:04:02.743
Great, great work.

862
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.598
Well done, mate.

863
01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.136
Thanks.

864
01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:18.760
See you after Christmas.

865
01:04:29.088 --> 01:04:30.349
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

866
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:34.378
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

867
01:04:36.142 --> 01:04:37.049
Merry Christmas.

868
01:04:37.132 --> 01:04:39.330
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

869
01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:41.548
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

870
01:04:42.483 --> 01:04:44.270
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas, Harry.

871
01:04:44.354 --> 01:04:45.413
Have a great Christmas, Luna.

872
01:04:45.496 --> 01:04:46.748
We've been thinking, Harry.

873
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:49.362
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles into her tea.

874
01:04:49.445 --> 01:04:50.319
Or Fever Fudge.

875
01:04:50.402 --> 01:04:52.173
They give you these massive,
pus-filled boils...

876
01:04:52.256 --> 01:04:54.359
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

877
01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.203
Are you all right?

878
01:05:08.063 --> 01:05:10.510
I heard Umbridge gave you
a rough time the other day.

879
01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:12.368
Yeah. I'm okay.

880
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.741
Anyway, it's worth it.

881
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.366
It's just, learning all this...

882
01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.860
...makes me wonder
whether, if he'd known it...

883
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.706
Cedric... Cedric did know this stuff.

884
01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.523
He was really good.

885
01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:38.044
It's just Voldemort was better.

886
01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:45.090
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

887
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:48.455
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

888
01:05:58.410 --> 01:05:59.643
Mistletoe.

889
01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.113
Probably full of Nargles, though.

890
01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.699
What are Nargles?

891
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:10.177
No idea.

892
01:06:32.893 --> 01:06:34.499
Well, how was it?

893
01:06:35.776 --> 01:06:36.747
Wet.

894
01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.208
I mean, she was sort of crying.

895
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.243
That bad at it, are you?

896
01:06:42.205 --> 01:06:44.336
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

897
01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:49.671
Cho spends half her time crying
these days.

898
01:06:50.153 --> 01:06:52.092
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

899
01:06:53.732 --> 01:06:55.737
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

900
01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:04.014
Well, obviously,
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

901
01:07:04.769 --> 01:07:07.469
...and now all confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him,

902
01:07:08.135 --> 01:07:09.092
...conflicted because Umbridge...

903
01:07:09.177 --> 01:07:10.783
...is starting to sack her mum
from the Ministry...

904
01:07:10.866 --> 01:07:12.328
...and frightened of failing her OWLs...

905
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:14.130
...because she's so busy worrying
about everything else.

906
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.807
One person couldn't feel all that.

907
01:07:19.156 --> 01:07:20.231
They'd explode.

908
01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.017
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...

909
01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.470
<i>Harry.</i>

910
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:52.394
<i>Voldemort may be after something.</i>

911
01:07:53.658 --> 01:07:56.138
<i>Something he didn't have last time.</i>

912
01:07:57.830 --> 01:07:58.937
<i>Harry.</i>

913
01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:01.990
<i>Harry.</i>

914
01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.855
In the dream, were you standing
next to the victim?

915
01:08:36.777 --> 01:08:38.395
Or looking down at the scene?

916
01:08:38.478 --> 01:08:40.813
Neither. It was like I...

917
01:08:42.544 --> 01:08:44.038
Professor, will you please just tell me
what's happening?

918
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.909
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

919
01:08:46.993 --> 01:08:49.042
Make sure he's found by the right people.

920
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.257
- Sir.
- Phineas.

921
01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:53.325
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

922
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.055
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

923
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:59.843
...and his children
will be arriving there soon by Portkey.

924
01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.009
They've got him, Albus.

925
01:09:02.092 --> 01:09:04.004
It was close,
but they think he'll make it.

926
01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:06.620
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

927
01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:08.566
Thank goodness. Next we need to...

928
01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:09.547
Look at me!

929
01:09:16.683 --> 01:09:17.905
What's happening to me?

930
01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:28.777
You wished to see me, Headmaster?

931
01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.937
Severus.

932
01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.267
I'm afraid we can't wait.

933
01:09:32.148 --> 01:09:33.225
Not even till the morning.

934
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:35.915
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

935
01:09:42.027 --> 01:09:43.358
It appears there's a connection...

936
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.852
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

937
01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:47.137
Whether he is, as yet,

938
01:09:47.222 --> 01:09:50.236
aware of this connection is,
for the moment, unclear.

939
01:09:50.594 --> 01:09:53.094
Pray he remains ignorant.

940
01:09:53.854 --> 01:09:56.120
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

941
01:09:57.450 --> 01:09:58.908
...he'll be able to read my mind?

942
01:09:58.992 --> 01:10:00.815
Read it, control it.

943
01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.167
Unhinge it.

944
01:10:04.148 --> 01:10:05.301
In the past,

945
01:10:05.385 --> 01:10:07.479
it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure...

946
01:10:07.563 --> 01:10:09.925
...to invade the minds of his victims...

947
01:10:10.009 --> 01:10:13.662
...creating visions
designed to torture them into madness.

948
01:10:14.886 --> 01:10:19.757
Only after extracting
the last exquisite ounce of agony...

949
01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.171
...only when he had them
literally begging for death,

950
01:10:22.254 --> 01:10:23.534
would he finally...

951
01:10:24.358 --> 01:10:25.370
...kill them.

952
01:10:26.436 --> 01:10:27.493
Used properly,

953
01:10:27.576 --> 01:10:28.864
the power of Occlumency...

954
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:32.168
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

955
01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.345
In these lessons,

956
01:10:34.429 --> 01:10:37.464
I will attempt to penetrate your mind.

957
01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.138
You will attempt to resist.

958
01:10:40.982 --> 01:10:42.256
Prepare yourself.

959
01:10:45.677 --> 01:10:46.873
<i>Legilimens.</i>

960
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:57.191
Concentrate, Potter.

961
01:10:57.459 --> 01:10:58.553
Focus.

962
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:26.042
Merry Christmas.

963
01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:29.344
Here we go.

964
01:11:29.816 --> 01:11:31.275
Daddy's back.

965
01:11:35.453 --> 01:11:37.087
Sit down, everybody, sit down.

966
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:39.196
That's it. Now, presents.

967
01:11:39.279 --> 01:11:41.116
And a nice big box for Ron.

968
01:11:41.199 --> 01:11:43.513
Big box for you. And...

969
01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.583
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

970
01:11:48.666 --> 01:11:50.669
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

971
01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:53.318
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

972
01:11:53.402 --> 01:11:55.508
Just what he wanted, actually.

973
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:57.085
Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

974
01:11:58.368 --> 01:12:00.187
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

975
01:12:01.347 --> 01:12:02.648
Harry, Harry.

976
01:12:03.558 --> 01:12:05.117
There you are.

977
01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:08.255
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

978
01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:10.704
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

979
01:12:10.788 --> 01:12:12.502
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

980
01:12:12.873 --> 01:12:14.279
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

981
01:12:14.362 --> 01:12:16.075
- Toast!
- Fred? George?

982
01:12:16.323 --> 01:12:18.026
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

983
01:12:18.775 --> 01:12:20.113
To Mr. Harry Potter...

984
01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.666
...without whom I would not be here.

985
01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.730
- Harry.
- Harry.

986
01:12:30.795 --> 01:12:31.813
Harry.

987
01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.288
That is delicious.

988
01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:36.074
I shall be needing some more of that.

989
01:12:36.157 --> 01:12:38.280
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

990
01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:41.508
I can't understand why
you don't want to wear it, Ronald.

991
01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.337
Because I look like
a bloody idiot, that's why.

992
01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:46.653
No more than usual, Ron.

993
01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.546
I don't know why...

994
01:12:55.373 --> 01:12:58.952
Nasty brat,
standing there as bold as brass.

995
01:13:00.128 --> 01:13:01.175
Harry Potter,

996
01:13:01.743 --> 01:13:04.616
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

997
01:13:05.035 --> 01:13:08.025
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.

998
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:11.066
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

999
01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:12.465
That's enough of your bile.

1000
01:13:13.245 --> 01:13:14.181
Away with you!

1001
01:13:14.264 --> 01:13:15.877
Of course, master.

1002
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:19.810
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

1003
01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.381
Sorry about that.

1004
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:28.562
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

1005
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:31.082
Not to me, anyway.

1006
01:13:32.895 --> 01:13:34.441
What, you grew up here?

1007
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:36.258
This is my parents' house.

1008
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:40.372
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

1009
01:13:42.503 --> 01:13:44.701
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

1010
01:13:47.243 --> 01:13:49.087
This is the Black Family Tree.

1011
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:51.992
My deranged cousin.

1012
01:13:52.725 --> 01:13:54.368
I hated the lot of them.

1013
01:13:55.554 --> 01:13:59.229
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

1014
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.309
My mother did that after I ran away.

1015
01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:10.781
Charming woman.

1016
01:14:12.887 --> 01:14:14.020
I was 16.

1017
01:14:15.325 --> 01:14:16.520
Where did you go?

1018
01:14:18.853 --> 01:14:20.010
Round your dad's.

1019
01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:23.132
I was always welcome at the Potter's.

1020
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:26.849
I see him so much in you, Harry.

1021
01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.947
You are so very much alike.

1022
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:32.846
I'm not so sure.

1023
01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.216
Sirius, when I was...

1024
01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:42.341
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

1025
01:14:44.555 --> 01:14:45.736
I was the snake.

1026
01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:49.893
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office,

1027
01:14:49.976 --> 01:14:53.166
...there was a moment when I wanted to...

1028
01:14:59.379 --> 01:15:02.202
This connection between me and Voldemort.

1029
01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:06.457
What if the reason for it is that
I am becoming more like him?

1030
01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:12.034
I just feel so angry all the time.

1031
01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.940
And...

1032
01:15:14.626 --> 01:15:16.788
...what if, after everything
that I've been through,

1033
01:15:17.587 --> 01:15:19.690
something's gone wrong inside me?

1034
01:15:19.774 --> 01:15:21.167
What if I'm becoming bad?

1035
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:25.978
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.

1036
01:15:28.306 --> 01:15:30.557
You're not a bad person.

1037
01:15:32.105 --> 01:15:35.426
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

1038
01:15:37.137 --> 01:15:38.150
You understand?

1039
01:15:40.304 --> 01:15:43.092
Besides, the world isn't split into...

1040
01:15:44.049 --> 01:15:45.304
...good people and Death Eaters.

1041
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.891
We've all got both light
and dark inside of us.

1042
01:15:50.644 --> 01:15:52.876
What matters is the part
we choose to act on.

1043
01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:57.276
That's who we really are.

1044
01:16:01.903 --> 01:16:03.234
Harry, time to go.

1045
01:16:05.458 --> 01:16:06.705
When all this is over,

1046
01:16:07.425 --> 01:16:08.596
we'll be a proper family.

1047
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:10.930
You'll see.

1048
01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:13.496
Come on.

1049
01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:52.578
Really?

1050
01:16:52.662 --> 01:16:54.445
Harry. Harry.

1051
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:56.614
Hagrid's back.

1052
01:17:00.456 --> 01:17:01.468
I'm sorry.

1053
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:18.631
I will say this one last time.

1054
01:17:19.705 --> 01:17:22.399
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

1055
01:17:22.483 --> 01:17:23.846
I told you.

1056
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:25.449
I've been away for me health.

1057
01:17:25.899 --> 01:17:27.130
Your health?

1058
01:17:27.214 --> 01:17:29.490
Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

1059
01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:31.262
Oh, yes.

1060
01:17:31.345 --> 01:17:34.711
As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

1061
01:17:37.090 --> 01:17:38.036
If I were you,

1062
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.594
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

1063
01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.827
In fact, I might not bother
unpacking at all.

1064
01:18:01.968 --> 01:18:03.943
This is top-secret, right?

1065
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:08.280
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

1066
01:18:08.339 --> 01:18:09.554
Giants?

1067
01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:12.291
You found them?

1068
01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:14.775
Well, they're not that hard to find,
to be perfectly honest.

1069
01:18:15.089 --> 01:18:16.334
They're so big, see?

1070
01:18:17.238 --> 01:18:19.874
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

1071
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:22.852
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.

1072
01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:25.349
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

1073
01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.924
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

1074
01:18:30.032 --> 01:18:32.375
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

1075
01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.661
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them.

1076
01:18:34.745 --> 01:18:35.861
I suppose.

1077
01:18:39.359 --> 01:18:41.016
And they did this to you?

1078
01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.180
Not exactly, no.

1079
01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:47.443
Go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.

1080
01:19:02.408 --> 01:19:03.577
It's changing out there.

1081
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:06.251
Just like last time.

1082
01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:09.570
There's a storm coming, Harry.

1083
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:12.470
We'd all best be ready when she does.

1084
01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:53.476
We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...

1085
01:19:53.559 --> 01:19:56.466
...in the early hours
of yesterday evening did escape.

1086
01:19:56.549 --> 01:20:00.456
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.

1087
01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.520
We strongly suspect...

1088
01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.520
...that the breakout was engineered...

1089
01:20:05.603 --> 01:20:09.565
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban,

1090
01:20:10.012 --> 01:20:12.406
notorious mass murderer...

1091
01:20:13.336 --> 01:20:14.564
...Sirius Black.

1092
01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:18.759
Cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.

1093
01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:31.905
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.

1094
01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:34.935
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

1095
01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.190
Harry.

1096
01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:39.570
I...

1097
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:42.159
I wanted to apologize.

1098
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.701
Now even me mum says "The Prophet's"
version of things don't add up.

1099
01:20:47.886 --> 01:20:50.802
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that...

1100
01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:52.991
...I believe you.

1101
01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:01.873
Neville?

1102
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:16.195
Fourteen years ago,

1103
01:21:17.294 --> 01:21:20.734
a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...

1104
01:21:21.719 --> 01:21:24.149
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

1105
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.286
She tortured them for information...

1106
01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:30.708
...but they never gave in.

1107
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:34.886
I'm quite proud to be their son.

1108
01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:39.753
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

1109
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:48.282
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.

1110
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:50.092
That's a promise.

1111
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:57.530
Make it a powerful memory,

1112
01:21:57.614 --> 01:21:58.859
the happiest you can remember.

1113
01:21:58.943 --> 01:22:00.339
Allow it to fill you up.

1114
01:22:00.422 --> 01:22:01.606
Keep trying, Seamus.

1115
01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:03.984
George, your turn now.

1116
01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:06.596
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

1117
01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:11.930
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce.

1118
01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:14.254
But shield forms
can also be equally useful...

1119
01:22:14.339 --> 01:22:16.014
...against a variety of opponents.

1120
01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:17.368
Wow, that was really good.

1121
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:19.671
Fantastic, Ginny.

1122
01:22:19.755 --> 01:22:20.763
Just remember,

1123
01:22:20.848 --> 01:22:23.931
your Patronus can only protect you
for as long as you stay focused.

1124
01:22:24.014 --> 01:22:25.285
So focus, Luna.

1125
01:22:30.105 --> 01:22:31.574
Think of the happiest thing you can.

1126
01:22:31.658 --> 01:22:33.128
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

1127
01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.975
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

1128
01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:40.460
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.

1129
01:22:42.338 --> 01:22:43.822
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

1130
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:27.975
I'll make short work of this.

1131
01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:32.190
<i>Bombarda Maxima.</i>

1132
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:51.458
Get them.

1133
01:23:52.230 --> 01:23:53.707
Been watching them for weeks.

1134
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:55.896
And see, Dumbledore's Army.

1135
01:23:56.233 --> 01:23:59.930
Proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

1136
01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.552
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

1137
01:24:03.636 --> 01:24:05.253
...never fooled us for a minute.

1138
01:24:05.336 --> 01:24:07.379
We saw your lies for what they were.

1139
01:24:07.463 --> 01:24:10.877
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

1140
01:24:11.317 --> 01:24:12.273
Naturally.

1141
01:24:12.356 --> 01:24:13.281
No, Professor.

1142
01:24:13.364 --> 01:24:15.149
He had nothing to do with it.
It was me.

1143
01:24:15.232 --> 01:24:17.015
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me.

1144
01:24:17.615 --> 01:24:19.158
But as has been pointed out,

1145
01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:22.408
the parchment clearly
says Dumbledore's Army,

1146
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:23.638
not Potter's.

1147
01:24:24.277 --> 01:24:26.610
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

1148
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.635
And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.

1149
01:24:30.718 --> 01:24:32.460
Dispatch an owl to "The Daily Prophet".

1150
01:24:32.544 --> 01:24:34.509
If we hurry, we should still
make the morning edition.

1151
01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:36.952
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,

1152
01:24:37.549 --> 01:24:39.188
you will escort Dumbledore...

1153
01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.480
...to Azkaban...

1154
01:24:43.050 --> 01:24:45.792
...to await trial for conspiracy...

1155
01:24:46.434 --> 01:24:47.428
...and sedition.

1156
01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.269
I thought we might hit this little snag.

1157
01:24:52.485 --> 01:24:55.500
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to...

1158
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:57.469
What was the phrase?

1159
01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:59.233
...come quietly.

1160
01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:00.970
Well, I can tell you this.

1161
01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.283
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

1162
01:25:04.366 --> 01:25:05.422
Enough of this.

1163
01:25:06.170 --> 01:25:07.347
Take him.

1164
01:25:20.198 --> 01:25:21.271
Well,

1165
01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:23.567
you may not like him, Minister...

1166
01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:25.895
...but you can't deny,

1167
01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.166
Dumbledore has got style.

1168
01:25:53.853 --> 01:25:58.367
<i>Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within 8 inches of each other.</i>

1169
01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.092
<i>Those wishing to join...</i>

1170
01:26:00.176 --> 01:26:02.474
<i>...the Inquisitorial Squad
for extra credit...</i>

1171
01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.793
<i>Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.</i>

1172
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.232
<i>Any student in non-compliance
will be expelled.</i>

1173
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:24.415
Harry.

1174
01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:32.991
You did everything you could.

1175
01:27:33.595 --> 01:27:35.304
No one could win against that old hag.

1176
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:37.103
Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.

1177
01:27:38.599 --> 01:27:40.520
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

1178
01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:42.573
Yeah, we talked you into it.

1179
01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:44.508
Yeah, but I agreed.

1180
01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:49.011
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.

1181
01:27:51.970 --> 01:27:53.436
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

1182
01:27:55.513 --> 01:27:57.008
Because I don't want to play anymore.

1183
01:27:57.092 --> 01:27:59.150
All it does is make you care too much.

1184
01:27:59.925 --> 01:28:01.594
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

1185
01:28:02.757 --> 01:28:04.104
So maybe it's just better to...

1186
01:28:04.188 --> 01:28:05.240
To what?

1187
01:28:08.193 --> 01:28:09.286
To go it alone.

1188
01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.380
Hagrid.

1189
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:23.341
Any idea where he's taking us?

1190
01:28:24.468 --> 01:28:26.544
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

1191
01:28:35.812 --> 01:28:37.918
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

1192
01:28:38.484 --> 01:28:40.247
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

1193
01:28:42.188 --> 01:28:44.443
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more.

1194
01:28:44.526 --> 01:28:46.876
They'll gonna have a full uprising
on their hands.

1195
01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.305
Hagrid, what's going on?

1196
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:51.058
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

1197
01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:53.373
I wouldn't be bothering you
at all with it, but...

1198
01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:55.313
...with Dumbledore gone,

1199
01:28:56.888 --> 01:28:59.681
I'll likely be getting
the sack any day now.

1200
01:29:00.255 --> 01:29:02.900
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

1201
01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:09.181
Grawpy.

1202
01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.980
Down here, you great buffoon.

1203
01:29:20.256 --> 01:29:21.329
Grawpy.

1204
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:24.087
Brought you some company.

1205
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.421
I couldn't just leave him, because...

1206
01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.045
Because he's my brother.

1207
01:29:41.128 --> 01:29:42.378
Blimey.

1208
01:29:42.462 --> 01:29:43.769
Well, half-brother, really.

1209
01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.867
He's completely harmless,
just like I said.

1210
01:29:47.665 --> 01:29:49.485
Little high-spirited, is all.

1211
01:29:52.170 --> 01:29:54.296
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

1212
01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:56.703
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?

1213
01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.121
That's your new friend, Hermione.

1214
01:29:59.712 --> 01:30:00.900
Grawpy.

1215
01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:06.202
Grawp.

1216
01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.540
Put me down.

1217
01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:16.367
Now.

1218
01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:29.990
You all right?

1219
01:30:31.408 --> 01:30:32.434
Fine.

1220
01:30:33.370 --> 01:30:34.921
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1221
01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.408
I think you've got an admirer.

1222
01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.461
You just stay away from her, all right?

1223
01:31:13.118 --> 01:31:14.815
He gets his own food and all.

1224
01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:19.421
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.

1225
01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:22.784
You will look after him, won't you?

1226
01:31:24.230 --> 01:31:25.946
I'm the only family he's got.

1227
01:31:40.544 --> 01:31:42.391
Feeling sentimental?

1228
01:31:45.610 --> 01:31:46.992
That's private.

1229
01:31:47.076 --> 01:31:48.782
Not to me.

1230
01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:52.769
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1231
01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.915
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.

1232
01:31:58.999 --> 01:32:02.094
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1233
01:32:04.403 --> 01:32:05.856
You're just like your father.

1234
01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:08.603
Lazy, arrogant.

1235
01:32:08.687 --> 01:32:10.614
Don't say a word against my father.

1236
01:32:10.697 --> 01:32:12.108
- Weak.
- I'm not weak.

1237
01:32:12.190 --> 01:32:13.346
Then prove it.

1238
01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:15.669
Control your emotions.

1239
01:32:15.932 --> 01:32:17.719
Discipline your mind.

1240
01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:23.052
<i>Legilimens.</i>

1241
01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:31.370
<i>Harry.</i>

1242
01:32:31.454 --> 01:32:32.491
Sirius.

1243
01:32:33.890 --> 01:32:35.220
I may vomit.

1244
01:32:35.646 --> 01:32:36.606
Stop it.

1245
01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:39.801
Is this what you call control?

1246
01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.469
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.

1247
01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:46.554
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1248
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:50.736
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1249
01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:52.468
Sentimental children forever whining...

1250
01:32:52.553 --> 01:32:54.497
...about how bitterly unfair
your lives have been.

1251
01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:58.425
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.

1252
01:32:58.508 --> 01:33:00.337
Your blessed father knew that.

1253
01:33:00.422 --> 01:33:02.168
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1254
01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:03.687
My father was a great man.

1255
01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:05.752
Your father was a swine.

1256
01:33:06.775 --> 01:33:07.743
<i>- Legilimens.
- Protego.</i>

1257
01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:15.345
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1258
01:33:15.428 --> 01:33:16.298
Snape.

1259
01:33:16.794 --> 01:33:17.644
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

1260
01:33:17.730 --> 01:33:19.411
Nice one, James.

1261
01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:21.289
- Dad.
- <i>Impedimenta.</i>

1262
01:33:21.372 --> 01:33:24.319
<i>Snivellus Greasy
Snivellus Greasy</i>

1263
01:33:24.404 --> 01:33:27.325
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1264
01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:29.733
<i>Snivellus Greasy
Snivellus Greasy</i>

1265
01:33:29.816 --> 01:33:30.810
Enough.

1266
01:33:33.089 --> 01:33:34.213
Enough.

1267
01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:45.720
Your lessons are at an end.

1268
01:33:45.787 --> 01:33:47.079
I...

1269
01:33:47.162 --> 01:33:49.709
Get out.

1270
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:09.920
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1271
01:34:10.004 --> 01:34:11.980
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1272
01:34:12.064 --> 01:34:14.802
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1273
01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:16.509
It's fading already.

1274
01:34:17.490 --> 01:34:19.109
You can hardly see ours anymore,

1275
01:34:19.193 --> 01:34:21.429
and the pain stops after a while.

1276
01:34:29.579 --> 01:34:31.703
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter,

1277
01:34:32.582 --> 01:34:35.416
naughty children deserve to be punished.

1278
01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:40.729
You know, George,

1279
01:34:40.812 --> 01:34:44.187
I've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.

1280
01:34:44.690 --> 01:34:48.167
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1281
01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.860
Hey!

1282
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.883
Here you go.

1283
01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:39.506
Ready when you are.

1284
01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:08.735
I need that prophecy.

1285
01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.943
You'll have to kill me.

1286
01:38:12.728 --> 01:38:13.654
I will.

1287
01:38:13.737 --> 01:38:15.945
But first, you will fetch it for me.

1288
01:38:16.630 --> 01:38:18.065
<i>Crucio.</i>

1289
01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.570
<i>Crucio.</i>

1290
01:38:34.237 --> 01:38:35.346
Sirius.

1291
01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:36.915
Harry, are you sure?

1292
01:38:36.998 --> 01:38:37.887
I saw it.

1293
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:39.544
It's just like with Mr. Weasley.

1294
01:38:39.630 --> 01:38:41.513
It's the same door
I've been dreaming about for months.

1295
01:38:41.597 --> 01:38:43.471
I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.

1296
01:38:43.555 --> 01:38:45.887
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.

1297
01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:47.774
Something he didn't have the last time,

1298
01:38:47.859 --> 01:38:49.384
and it's in the Department of Mysteries.

1299
01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:50.620
Harry, please, just listen.

1300
01:38:53.044 --> 01:38:54.740
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?

1301
01:38:56.210 --> 01:38:58.963
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1302
01:38:59.046 --> 01:39:00.176
What if he is?

1303
01:39:00.849 --> 01:39:02.210
I'm supposed to just let him die?

1304
01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.684
Hermione, he's the only family
I've got left.

1305
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:10.407
What do we do?

1306
01:39:11.715 --> 01:39:13.365
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1307
01:39:13.448 --> 01:39:15.550
Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.

1308
01:39:15.613 --> 01:39:16.609
Not all of them.

1309
01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:21.430
<i>Alohomora.</i>

1310
01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.095
Alert the Order if you can.

1311
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:35.958
Are you mental? We're going with you.

1312
01:39:36.042 --> 01:39:37.164
It's too dangerous.

1313
01:39:38.356 --> 01:39:40.169
When are you going
to get it into your head?

1314
01:39:40.759 --> 01:39:42.069
We're in this together.

1315
01:39:42.153 --> 01:39:44.227
That you are.

1316
01:39:45.455 --> 01:39:47.597
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.

1317
01:39:53.470 --> 01:39:55.213
You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?

1318
01:39:55.529 --> 01:39:56.460
No.

1319
01:39:56.544 --> 01:39:57.488
Liar.

1320
01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.727
You sent for me, Headmistress?

1321
01:39:59.812 --> 01:40:00.868
Snape, yes.

1322
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:02.630
The time has come for answers,

1323
01:40:02.713 --> 01:40:04.384
whether he wants
to give them to me or not.

1324
01:40:04.979 --> 01:40:06.168
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1325
01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:09.549
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.

1326
01:40:09.633 --> 01:40:11.616
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1327
01:40:16.794 --> 01:40:18.275
Unless you wish to poison him.

1328
01:40:18.358 --> 01:40:21.581
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1329
01:40:23.497 --> 01:40:24.702
I cannot help you.

1330
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:29.159
He's got Padfoot.

1331
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:33.096
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.

1332
01:40:34.616 --> 01:40:36.544
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1333
01:40:36.627 --> 01:40:37.701
What is he talking about, Snape?

1334
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.977
No idea.

1335
01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:52.508
Very well.

1336
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:55.388
You give me no choice, Potter.

1337
01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:59.790
As this is an issue of Ministry security,

1338
01:40:59.873 --> 01:41:01.176
...you leave me with...

1339
01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:03.819
...no alternative.

1340
01:41:05.610 --> 01:41:07.670
The Cruciatus Curse ought
to loosen your tongue.

1341
01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:08.884
That's illegal.

1342
01:41:08.967 --> 01:41:12.380
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.

1343
01:41:19.819 --> 01:41:20.948
Tell her, Harry!

1344
01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:23.939
Tell me what?

1345
01:41:25.616 --> 01:41:27.050
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1346
01:41:28.284 --> 01:41:29.185
...I will.

1347
01:41:31.630 --> 01:41:33.039
Where what is?

1348
01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:36.013
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1349
01:41:41.996 --> 01:41:43.527
How much further?

1350
01:41:43.610 --> 01:41:44.619
Not far.

1351
01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:50.145
It had to be somewhere students
wouldn't find it accidentally.

1352
01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.405
What are you doing?

1353
01:41:56.859 --> 01:41:58.084
Improvising.

1354
01:42:07.368 --> 01:42:08.538
Well?

1355
01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:11.432
Where is this weapon?

1356
01:42:17.325 --> 01:42:18.489
There isn't one, is there?

1357
01:42:22.319 --> 01:42:23.415
You were trying to trick me.

1358
01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:29.625
You know...

1359
01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:33.002
...I really hate children.

1360
01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:51.364
You have no business here, centaur.

1361
01:42:51.448 --> 01:42:53.078
This is a Ministry matter.

1362
01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:57.686
Lower your weapons.

1363
01:42:58.190 --> 01:43:00.729
I warn you, under the law,

1364
01:43:00.813 --> 01:43:03.636
as creatures
of near-human intelligence...

1365
01:43:03.719 --> 01:43:04.912
<i>Protego.</i>

1366
01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.520
How dare you?

1367
01:43:07.222 --> 01:43:08.690
Filthy half-breed.

1368
01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:10.526
<i>Incarcerous.</i>

1369
01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.386
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1370
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:27.425
Now, enough.

1371
01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:30.638
I will have order.

1372
01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:42.049
You filthy animal.

1373
01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:45.357
Do you know who I am?

1374
01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:48.055
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1375
01:43:48.904 --> 01:43:50.532
No, he doesn't understand.

1376
01:43:58.380 --> 01:43:59.653
Potter, do something.

1377
01:43:59.736 --> 01:44:01.552
Tell them I mean no harm.

1378
01:44:02.103 --> 01:44:03.380
I'm sorry, Professor.

1379
01:44:04.263 --> 01:44:05.642
But I must not tell lies.

1380
01:44:05.726 --> 01:44:07.157
What are you doing?

1381
01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:11.488
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1382
01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:13.825
Let me go!

1383
01:44:16.536 --> 01:44:17.631
Thank you, Grawp.

1384
01:44:18.489 --> 01:44:19.710
Hermione.

1385
01:44:19.793 --> 01:44:20.970
Hermione, Sirius.

1386
01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.053
How'd you get away?

1387
01:44:31.136 --> 01:44:33.357
Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1388
01:44:34.018 --> 01:44:35.867
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.

1389
01:44:36.347 --> 01:44:38.511
Of course, they told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1390
01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:40.625
That was clever, Ron.

1391
01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.044
Has been known to happen.

1392
01:44:43.128 --> 01:44:44.157
It was brilliant.

1393
01:44:44.630 --> 01:44:46.207
So how are we getting to London?

1394
01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:50.274
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1395
01:44:50.877 --> 01:44:53.873
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1396
01:44:55.118 --> 01:44:57.347
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1397
01:44:58.340 --> 01:44:59.567
Or was that all just words to you?

1398
01:45:02.493 --> 01:45:04.530
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.

1399
01:45:10.554 --> 01:45:11.968
So how are we going to get to London?

1400
01:45:14.102 --> 01:45:15.398
We fly, of course.

1401
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:09.470
<i>Department of Mysteries.</i>

1402
01:46:18.365 --> 01:46:19.344
This is it.

1403
01:47:13.010 --> 01:47:15.340
92, 93.

1404
01:47:17.050 --> 01:47:18.202
94.

1405
01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:20.710
95.

1406
01:47:33.344 --> 01:47:34.512
He should be here.

1407
01:47:35.478 --> 01:47:36.408
Harry.

1408
01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:40.030
It's got your name on it.

1409
01:48:05.443 --> 01:48:09.447
<i>The one with the power to vanquish
the Dark Lord approaches.</i>

1410
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:12.930
<i>And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...</i>

1411
01:48:13.014 --> 01:48:15.909
<i>...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.</i>

1412
01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:25.991
<i>For neither can live
while the other survives.</i>

1413
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:30.450
Harry.

1414
01:48:41.026 --> 01:48:42.111
Where's Sirius?

1415
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:44.538
You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference...

1416
01:48:45.315 --> 01:48:46.607
...between dreams...

1417
01:48:50.562 --> 01:48:51.681
...and reality.

1418
01:48:54.170 --> 01:48:58.113
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1419
01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.251
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1420
01:49:01.334 --> 01:49:02.680
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1421
01:49:06.298 --> 01:49:07.971
He knows how to play.

1422
01:49:08.723 --> 01:49:11.847
Itty, bitty baby.

1423
01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:14.160
Potter.

1424
01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:15.977
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1425
01:49:16.857 --> 01:49:17.983
Neville Longbottom, is it?

1426
01:49:19.013 --> 01:49:19.977
How's mum and dad?

1427
01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:21.765
Better, now they're about to be avenged.

1428
01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:25.878
Now, let's...

1429
01:49:26.335 --> 01:49:29.301
Everybody just calm down...

1430
01:49:29.850 --> 01:49:30.956
...shall we?

1431
01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.076
All we want is that prophecy.

1432
01:49:34.159 --> 01:49:36.350
Why did Voldemort need me
to come and get this?

1433
01:49:36.425 --> 01:49:37.670
You dare speak his name?

1434
01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:41.339
You filthy half-blood!

1435
01:49:41.423 --> 01:49:43.843
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1436
01:49:46.054 --> 01:49:50.709
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1437
01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:54.011
Which is lucky for you, really.

1438
01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:00.080
Haven't you always wondered...

1439
01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:02.731
...what was the reason
for the connection...

1440
01:50:02.814 --> 01:50:04.880
...between you and the Dark Lord?

1441
01:50:06.612 --> 01:50:08.397
Why he was unable to kill you...

1442
01:50:09.190 --> 01:50:11.216
...when you were just an infant?

1443
01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:15.106
Don't you want to know the secret...

1444
01:50:16.316 --> 01:50:17.548
...of your scar?

1445
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:20.301
All the answers are there,

1446
01:50:20.724 --> 01:50:21.585
Potter,

1447
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:22.780
in your hand.

1448
01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:25.595
All you have to do...

1449
01:50:27.010 --> 01:50:28.107
...is give it to me.

1450
01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.549
Then I can show you everything.

1451
01:50:41.290 --> 01:50:42.828
I've waited 14 years.

1452
01:50:43.690 --> 01:50:44.990
I know.

1453
01:50:46.290 --> 01:50:47.836
I guess I can wait a little longer.

1454
01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:49.297
Now. <i>Stupefy.</i>

1455
01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:50.465
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1456
01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:07.970
<i>Levicorpus.</i>

1457
01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:15.935
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

1458
01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:17.936
Well done, Neville.

1459
01:51:27.159 --> 01:51:28.520
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1460
01:51:30.270 --> 01:51:31.796
<i>- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.</i>

1461
01:51:42.650 --> 01:51:43.756
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1462
01:51:52.164 --> 01:51:53.390
<i>Reducto.</i>

1463
01:52:10.264 --> 01:52:11.501
Get back to the door.

1464
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:49.047
Department of Mysteries.

1465
01:52:49.935 --> 01:52:51.404
They got that bit right, didn't they?

1466
01:52:57.596 --> 01:52:58.767
The voices.

1467
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:01.164
Can you tell what they're saying?

1468
01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:04.918
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1469
01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:07.820
Let's get out of here.

1470
01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:09.591
I hear them too.

1471
01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:15.680
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1472
01:53:18.732 --> 01:53:20.050
Please, Harry.

1473
01:53:20.862 --> 01:53:22.013
Get behind me.

1474
01:54:09.276 --> 01:54:11.060
Did you actually believe...

1475
01:54:12.169 --> 01:54:15.833
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1476
01:54:17.405 --> 01:54:19.838
...that children stood a chance...

1477
01:54:21.027 --> 01:54:22.174
...against us?

1478
01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:29.291
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1479
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:35.867
Give me the prophecy now...

1480
01:54:36.970 --> 01:54:38.936
...or watch your friends...

1481
01:54:39.878 --> 01:54:40.964
...die.

1482
01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.644
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1483
01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:23.326
Get away from my godson.

1484
01:55:54.118 --> 01:55:55.203
Now, listen to me.

1485
01:55:55.288 --> 01:55:57.187
I want you to take the others
and get out of here.

1486
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:59.175
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1487
01:55:59.259 --> 01:56:01.125
You've done beautifully.

1488
01:56:02.685 --> 01:56:04.409
Now, let me take it from here.

1489
01:56:04.493 --> 01:56:05.600
Black.

1490
01:56:32.670 --> 01:56:34.110
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1491
01:56:34.219 --> 01:56:35.067
Nice one, James.

1492
01:56:42.577 --> 01:56:43.897
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

1493
01:57:04.476 --> 01:57:06.880
<i>No. No.</i>

1494
01:57:30.639 --> 01:57:32.901
I killed Sirius Black.

1495
01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:35.549
Are you coming to get me?

1496
01:57:35.633 --> 01:57:36.487
<i>Crucio.</i>

1497
01:57:48.796 --> 01:57:50.940
<i>You've got to mean it, Harry.</i>

1498
01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:53.357
<i>She killed him.</i>

1499
01:57:54.407 --> 01:57:55.832
<i>She deserves it.</i>

1500
01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:02.094
<i>You know the spell, Harry.</i>

1501
01:58:14.410 --> 01:58:15.521
Do it.

1502
01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:25.609
So weak.

1503
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:35.991
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.

1504
01:58:36.906 --> 01:58:38.608
The Aurors are on their way.

1505
01:58:38.690 --> 01:58:40.646
By which time I shall be gone.

1506
01:58:41.152 --> 01:58:42.392
And you...

1507
01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:45.635
...shall be dead.

1508
02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:02.793
You've lost, old man.

1509
02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:23.929
Harry.

1510
02:01:27.956 --> 02:01:29.345
<i>So weak.</i>

1511
02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:32.157
<i>So vulnerable.</i>

1512
02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:37.633
Look at me.

1513
02:01:40.150 --> 02:01:43.543
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1514
02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:46.033
It's how you are not.

1515
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.490
Harry?

1516
02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:27.370
You're the weak one...

1517
02:02:27.970 --> 02:02:29.367
...and you'll never know love...

1518
02:02:30.407 --> 02:02:32.117
...or friendship.

1519
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:37.497
And I feel sorry for you.

1520
02:03:01.470 --> 02:03:04.122
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1521
02:03:06.018 --> 02:03:07.691
And you will lose...

1522
02:03:09.068 --> 02:03:10.282
...everything.

1523
02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:26.962
He's back.

1524
02:04:35.355 --> 02:04:37.094
I know how you feel, Harry.

1525
02:04:37.177 --> 02:04:38.343
No, you don't.

1526
02:04:44.473 --> 02:04:45.455
It's my fault.

1527
02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:48.332
No, the fault is mine.

1528
02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:52.105
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1529
02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:54.536
...before Voldemort
made the connection between you.

1530
02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:58.513
I thought by distancing myself from you,

1531
02:04:59.156 --> 02:05:00.471
as I have done all year,

1532
02:05:00.555 --> 02:05:01.897
...he'd be less tempted.

1533
02:05:03.063 --> 02:05:05.078
And therefore you might
be more protected.

1534
02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:10.928
The prophecy said...

1535
02:05:12.533 --> 02:05:15.429
"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."

1536
02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:18.855
It means...

1537
02:05:19.410 --> 02:05:21.238
...one of us is gonna
have to kill the other,

1538
02:05:22.317 --> 02:05:23.405
in the end.

1539
02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:26.982
Yes.

1540
02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:29.003
Why didn't you tell me?

1541
02:05:29.650 --> 02:05:32.184
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1542
02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:35.442
The same reason your friends saved you.

1543
02:05:36.690 --> 02:05:39.333
After all these years,
after all you've suffered,

1544
02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:42.332
...I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1545
02:05:44.770 --> 02:05:46.182
I cared too much about you.

1546
02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:13.126
How come you're not at the feast?

1547
02:06:14.263 --> 02:06:15.715
Lost all my possessions.

1548
02:06:16.466 --> 02:06:18.333
Apparently people have been hiding them.

1549
02:06:19.032 --> 02:06:19.960
That's awful.

1550
02:06:20.436 --> 02:06:21.512
It's all good fun.

1551
02:06:22.210 --> 02:06:24.843
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1552
02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:27.118
Do you want any help finding them?

1553
02:06:31.110 --> 02:06:33.254
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1554
02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:42.862
Are you sure
you don't want any help looking?

1555
02:06:43.590 --> 02:06:44.665
That's all right.

1556
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:47.672
Anyway, my mum always said...

1557
02:06:47.755 --> 02:06:50.555
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1558
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:57.171
If not always in the way we expect.

1559
02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.294
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1560
02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:40.169
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1561
02:07:41.090 --> 02:07:42.127
What's that?

1562
02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:45.109
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us,

1563
02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:48.573
we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1564
02:07:49.590 --> 02:07:50.751
Yeah?

1565
02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.397
Something worth fighting for.
