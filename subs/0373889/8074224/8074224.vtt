1
00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.392
I don't know about you, it's
just too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:00:55.607 --> 00:00:58.795
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:03.469
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:06.419
So, please, remember to
cover up and stay cool...

5
00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:08.920
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

6
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.808
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:12.913 --> 00:01:13.877
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.721
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:21.128 --> 00:01:22.831
I'll make you your favorite
dinner to compensate.

10
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.922
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:28.143 --> 00:01:30.265
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:32.329
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:34.116 --> 00:01:35.124
Beat up another
10-year-old?

14
00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.878
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:39.295 --> 00:01:41.828
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:43.327 --> 00:01:47.452
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.791
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:55.757
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:57.131 --> 00:02:00.184
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."

20
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.725
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:06.102
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:08.527
She dead?

23
00:02:10.447 --> 00:02:11.537
Is she dead?

24
00:02:13.023 --> 00:02:13.935
Is she a dead Pott...?

25
00:02:28.288 --> 00:02:29.765
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:33.158 --> 00:02:34.673
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:34.892 --> 00:02:36.967
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:38.597 --> 00:02:39.658
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:30.304 --> 00:03:31.495
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.313
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:38.905 --> 00:04:39.359
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:44.445 --> 00:04:46.298
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:48.157
They might come back.

34
00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:53.530
Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?

35
00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:58.129
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. -
I don't understand. How do you know...?

36
00:04:58.405 --> 00:05:00.146
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:02.374
Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.811
After You-Know-Who killed that
poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:08.093 --> 00:05:10.406
...did you expect him to let
you go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.052
Good Lord, boy. They told
me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:13.594 --> 00:05:16.195
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.282
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:30.683 --> 00:05:33.096
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:34.652
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:05:36.104 --> 00:05:37.183
Diddykins?

46
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:39.121
Is that you?

47
00:05:42.886 --> 00:05:45.106
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.881
We're going to have to take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:51.199
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:56.182 --> 00:05:57.870
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:02.095
You've finally done it. You've
finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.958
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.672
Well, just look at him,
Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:11.239
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:06:12.047 --> 00:06:15.123
This is the last I'm gonna
take of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.160
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.904
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:37.562 --> 00:06:41.624
...you performed the Patronus
Charm in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:42.617 --> 00:06:44.310
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:44.723 --> 00:06:48.559
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:49.015 --> 00:06:50.743
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:51.593 --> 00:06:54.639
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:55.857 --> 00:06:58.286
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:07:04.143 --> 00:07:05.560
Justice.

65
00:07:18.857 --> 00:07:19.767
He's not very well.

66
00:07:33.542 --> 00:07:34.145
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:42.534 --> 00:08:44.125
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:08:44.595 --> 00:08:46.366
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

69
00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:52.499
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:53.554 --> 00:08:55.469
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:08:59.658 --> 00:09:02.156
But where are we going? The letter
said I've been expelled from Hogwarts.

72
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.691
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:05.878
But the letter said...

74
00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:08.648
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:10.691
- ... pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

76
00:09:11.096 --> 00:09:14.221
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.710
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:20.410
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:30.616
Stay in formation, everyone. Don't
break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:21.776
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:10:24.574 --> 00:10:24.947
Come on.

82
00:11:05.451 --> 00:11:06.293
In you go, son.

83
00:11:09.532 --> 00:11:10.487
There've been no sightings.

84
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.380
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:15.296
He almost killed Harry. If
that isn't proof enough...

86
00:11:15.611 --> 00:11:19.975
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

87
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.915
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:28.723
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.588
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.

90
00:11:32.034 --> 00:11:35.349
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:39.149
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:44.113 --> 00:11:45.847
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:50.431
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:11:54.652 --> 00:11:58.378
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will
wait until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:03.036
Nope. No time to explain. Straight
upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:04.618
Yeah.

97
00:12:08.492 --> 00:12:11.945
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

98
00:12:13.474 --> 00:12:17.317
If my poor mistress knew the
scum they let into her house...

99
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.443
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:12:22.194 --> 00:12:23.315
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.847
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:40.068 --> 00:12:43.910
Scum of the earth. Not like it
was in the days of my fathers.

103
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:44.624
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:50.157 --> 00:12:50.740
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:54.585 --> 00:12:57.656
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:12:58.594 --> 00:13:00.669
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.991
And this hearing at the
Ministry. It's just outrageous.

108
00:13:05.905 --> 00:13:07.501
I've looked it up. They
simply can't expel you.

109
00:13:08.402 --> 00:13:09.766
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

110
00:13:11.713 --> 00:13:13.354
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:17.027
So, what is this place?

112
00:13:18.182 --> 00:13:20.621
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:13:21.745 --> 00:13:22.583
It's a secret society.

114
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:25.507
Dumbledore formed it back
when they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.856
Couldn't have put any of
this in a letter, I suppose?

116
00:13:29.578 --> 00:13:31.143
I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.

117
00:13:32.295 --> 00:13:34.591
We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.

118
00:13:36.424 --> 00:13:37.362
- Only...
- Only what?

119
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.473
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:42.182 --> 00:13:43.151
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:45.704 --> 00:13:48.091
But why would he keep me in
the dark? Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:48.777 --> 00:13:50.965
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:50.965 --> 00:13:53.113
...the one who fought him, who
saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:53.489 --> 00:13:55.929
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.240
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...

126
00:14:00.512 --> 00:14:02.363
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.470
If anyone has a right to know, it's
Harry. If it wasn't for Harry...

128
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.486
...we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back.

129
00:14:09.742 --> 00:14:11.554
He's not a child, Molly.

130
00:14:11.554 --> 00:14:13.595
But he's not an adult either.

131
00:14:14.367 --> 00:14:17.252
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

132
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.429
He's as good as.

133
00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:21.712
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

134
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.257
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:14:24.517 --> 00:14:27.582
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be
a felon, just like his godfather.

136
00:14:28.066 --> 00:14:29.658
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

137
00:14:30.068 --> 00:14:31.817
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

138
00:14:32.066 --> 00:14:33.971
...about your supposed reformation.

139
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:36.017
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?

140
00:14:36.404 --> 00:14:37.631
- Get off it.
- Quick.

141
00:14:37.872 --> 00:14:39.940
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:14:40.733 --> 00:14:42.266
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:14:43.045 --> 00:14:45.536
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

144
00:14:45.982 --> 00:14:49.659
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:52.028 --> 00:14:54.563
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:56.377 --> 00:14:58.357
Just because you're
allowed to use magic now...

147
00:14:58.357 --> 00:15:00.908
...does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.

148
00:15:01.638 --> 00:15:02.109
Hi, Mum.

149
00:15:04.192 --> 00:15:04.983
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:15:06.003 --> 00:15:07.972
You sure you're all right,
Harry? Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:15:08.802 --> 00:15:09.747
Harry Potter.

152
00:15:13.076 --> 00:15:14.033
Sirius.

153
00:15:20.857 --> 00:15:22.296
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:15:23.357 --> 00:15:26.732
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:15:26.982 --> 00:15:29.238
I don't understand. What has the
Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.739
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:45.357 --> 00:15:47.202
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.931
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.121
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:58.472 --> 00:15:58.934
Why?

161
00:15:59.577 --> 00:16:02.467
The minister thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
But that's insane.

162
00:16:02.738 --> 00:16:04.432
No one in their right
mind could believe that...

163
00:16:04.432 --> 00:16:07.113
Exactly the point. Fudge
isn't in his right mind.

164
00:16:07.454 --> 00:16:09.311
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:16:11.716 --> 00:16:14.079
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:16:14.281 --> 00:16:16.424
The last time Voldemort gained power...

167
00:16:16.686 --> 00:16:19.456
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:16:20.623 --> 00:16:23.716
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the
minister will do almost anything...

169
00:16:24.113 --> 00:16:26.842
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:32.123
We think Voldemort wants
to build up his army again.

171
00:16:34.407 --> 00:16:36.861
Fourteen years ago, he had
huge numbers at his command.

172
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:40.468
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:42.506 --> 00:16:45.701
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:47.247 --> 00:16:50.406
But gathering followers isn't
the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:54.154 --> 00:16:54.671
We believe...

176
00:16:57.031 --> 00:16:58.800
...Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.498
Sirius.

178
00:17:03.763 --> 00:17:05.456
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:17:07.797 --> 00:17:09.590
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:17:10.421 --> 00:17:13.465
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:17:14.677 --> 00:17:17.421
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order straightaway.

182
00:17:17.718 --> 00:17:20.454
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:17:34.167 --> 00:17:35.165
Harry.

184
00:17:36.009 --> 00:17:37.602
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:17:38.321 --> 00:17:39.701
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:50.373 --> 00:17:51.297
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:52.468 --> 00:17:53.497
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:18:11.597 --> 00:18:12.117
Here we are.

189
00:18:15.521 --> 00:18:18.664
I've never used the visitors'
entrance before. Should be fun.

190
00:18:21.415 --> 00:18:23.664
Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:19:03.649 --> 00:19:08.035
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:19:08.288 --> 00:19:10.940
Daily Prophet, ladies and
gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.191
Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous?

194
00:19:36.972 --> 00:19:38.166
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

195
00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:43.036
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:19:43.928 --> 00:19:46.444
We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:53.054 --> 00:19:54.963
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.534
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?

199
00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:00.753
In five minutes.

200
00:20:10.024 --> 00:20:11.380
Department of Mysteries.

201
00:20:14.722 --> 00:20:19.129
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

202
00:20:20.162 --> 00:20:21.238
Yes, but we must be...

203
00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:31.520
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

204
00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:34.879
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

205
00:20:36.226 --> 00:20:38.352
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

206
00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:41.039
Yes?

207
00:20:42.913 --> 00:20:43.985
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

208
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:47.361
Good luck, Harry.

209
00:20:52.386 --> 00:20:54.348
Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August...

210
00:20:55.096 --> 00:20:57.782
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

211
00:20:58.154 --> 00:21:01.326
...resident at Number 4 Privet
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.

212
00:21:01.878 --> 00:21:05.371
Interrogators: Cornelius
Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...

213
00:21:05.575 --> 00:21:06.513
Witness for the defense.

214
00:21:07.357 --> 00:21:09.547
Albus Percival Wulfric...

215
00:21:10.785 --> 00:21:12.880
...Brian Dumbledore.

216
00:21:14.433 --> 00:21:17.748
You got our message that the
time and place of the hearing...

217
00:21:18.192 --> 00:21:20.178
- ... had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

218
00:21:20.694 --> 00:21:24.434
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.

219
00:21:27.506 --> 00:21:27.990
The charges?

220
00:21:28.726 --> 00:21:31.289
The charges against the
accused are as follows:

221
00:21:31.681 --> 00:21:32.697
"That he did knowingly...

222
00:21:33.287 --> 00:21:36.413
...and in full awareness of
the illegality of his actions...

223
00:21:36.665 --> 00:21:39.652
...produce a Patronus Charm...

224
00:21:40.414 --> 00:21:42.311
...in the presence of a Muggle."

225
00:21:43.633 --> 00:21:46.871
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

226
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:50.184
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

227
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.631
- ... while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

228
00:21:53.631 --> 00:21:56.997
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...

229
00:21:57.339 --> 00:21:58.947
I was only doing it because of the Dementors.

230
00:22:02.476 --> 00:22:02.988
Dementors?

231
00:22:04.551 --> 00:22:05.256
In Little Whinging?

232
00:22:07.222 --> 00:22:07.925
That's quite clever.

233
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.456
Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?

234
00:22:12.361 --> 00:22:14.174
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

235
00:22:14.643 --> 00:22:16.554
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.

236
00:22:17.526 --> 00:22:20.767
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

237
00:22:21.695 --> 00:22:26.072
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

238
00:22:26.072 --> 00:22:29.939
Pardon me, minister, but
as it happens, we can.

239
00:22:34.538 --> 00:22:36.600
Please describe the attack.

240
00:22:40.206 --> 00:22:41.174
What did they look like?

241
00:22:42.675 --> 00:22:47.675
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

242
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.829
Not the boys. The Dementors.

243
00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:54.989
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

244
00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:01.017
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

245
00:23:02.394 --> 00:23:05.391
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

246
00:23:06.157 --> 00:23:10.192
Now, look here. Dementors don't
just wander into a Muggle suburb...

247
00:23:10.735 --> 00:23:14.863
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

248
00:23:15.064 --> 00:23:16.288
I don't think anyone would believe...

249
00:23:16.288 --> 00:23:18.065
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

250
00:23:21.956 --> 00:23:24.627
I'm sure I must have
misunderstood you, professor.

251
00:23:25.415 --> 00:23:29.456
Dementors are, after all, under the
control of the Ministry of Magic.

252
00:23:31.183 --> 00:23:34.408
And it's so silly of me, but it
sounded for a moment as though...

253
00:23:35.494 --> 00:23:39.309
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

254
00:23:39.769 --> 00:23:42.309
That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Undersecretary...

255
00:23:42.798 --> 00:23:45.846
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

256
00:23:46.495 --> 00:23:49.703
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

257
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.986
...and why they mounted an
attack without authorization.

258
00:23:54.684 --> 00:23:55.810
Of course, there is someone...

259
00:23:57.463 --> 00:23:58.704
...who might be behind the attack.

260
00:24:02.955 --> 00:24:06.422
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

261
00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:11.890
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

262
00:24:12.542 --> 00:24:14.204
He is not back.

263
00:24:21.047 --> 00:24:22.289
In the matter of Harry Potter...

264
00:24:24.109 --> 00:24:25.170
...the law clearly states...

265
00:24:26.672 --> 00:24:30.734
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.

266
00:24:31.307 --> 00:24:34.151
Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.

267
00:24:34.754 --> 00:24:37.449
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

268
00:24:37.449 --> 00:24:40.057
...to deal with a simple
matter of underage magic?

269
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.619
Those in favor of conviction?

270
00:25:01.356 --> 00:25:05.499
Those in favor of clearing
the accused of all charges?

271
00:25:19.259 --> 00:25:21.404
Cleared of all charges.

272
00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.087
Professor.

273
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.685
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

274
00:25:43.595 --> 00:25:44.827
You'll blow the entire operation.

275
00:25:54.168 --> 00:25:56.356
Sirius, what are you doing
here? If somebody sees you...

276
00:25:57.166 --> 00:25:58.605
I had to see you off, didn't I?

277
00:26:01.448 --> 00:26:02.697
What's life without a little risk?

278
00:26:04.572 --> 00:26:06.289
I don't wanna see you get
chucked back in Azkaban.

279
00:26:06.541 --> 00:26:07.447
Don't worry about me.

280
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.355
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

281
00:26:19.071 --> 00:26:20.370
Original Order of the Phoenix.

282
00:26:22.529 --> 00:26:23.260
Marlene McKinnon.

283
00:26:24.744 --> 00:26:26.321
She was killed two weeks after this was taken.

284
00:26:27.605 --> 00:26:29.321
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

285
00:26:31.103 --> 00:26:32.038
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

286
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.562
Neville's parents.

287
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.126
They suffered a fate worse
than death, you ask me.

288
00:26:40.292 --> 00:26:41.415
It's been 14 years.

289
00:26:43.558 --> 00:26:46.356
And still a day doesn't go
by I don't miss your dad.

290
00:26:52.465 --> 00:26:54.267
Do you really think there's
going to be a war, Sirius?

291
00:26:57.677 --> 00:26:59.788
It feels like it did before.

292
00:27:05.065 --> 00:27:05.476
You keep it.

293
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:10.462
Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.

294
00:27:14.005 --> 00:27:14.957
I'll see you at the train.

295
00:27:16.036 --> 00:27:16.974
Bye-bye, darling.

296
00:27:18.595 --> 00:27:19.331
I love you.

297
00:27:20.845 --> 00:27:21.904
Hold my hand, lovey.

298
00:27:22.694 --> 00:27:24.476
There they are. They're in the far carriage.

299
00:27:25.726 --> 00:27:26.726
Bye.

300
00:28:09.485 --> 00:28:11.822
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

301
00:28:12.414 --> 00:28:13.402
Better enjoy it while you can.

302
00:28:14.101 --> 00:28:16.103
I expect there's a cell in
Azkaban with your name on it.

303
00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:22.617
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

304
00:28:25.194 --> 00:28:26.065
It's only Malfoy.

305
00:28:27.276 --> 00:28:27.914
What'd you expect?

306
00:28:49.552 --> 00:28:50.161
Hi, guys.

307
00:28:50.396 --> 00:28:51.685
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

308
00:29:05.614 --> 00:29:06.003
What is it?

309
00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:11.287
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

310
00:29:13.488 --> 00:29:14.798
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

311
00:29:16.362 --> 00:29:17.612
It's pulling itself, like always.

312
00:29:32.315 --> 00:29:33.011
You're not going mad.

313
00:29:36.581 --> 00:29:38.004
I can see them too.

314
00:29:40.667 --> 00:29:41.738
You're just as sane as I am.

315
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:49.764
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

316
00:29:52.881 --> 00:29:53.908
Luna Lovegood.

317
00:29:58.884 --> 00:29:59.945
What an interesting necklace.

318
00:30:01.565 --> 00:30:02.666
It's a charm, actually.

319
00:30:05.014 --> 00:30:05.957
Keeps away the Nargles.

320
00:30:10.452 --> 00:30:10.977
Hungry.

321
00:30:12.709 --> 00:30:13.917
I hope there's pudding.

322
00:30:15.802 --> 00:30:18.117
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

323
00:30:31.676 --> 00:30:32.623
Good evening, children.

324
00:30:34.553 --> 00:30:36.989
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

325
00:30:37.458 --> 00:30:39.723
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

326
00:30:40.646 --> 00:30:42.238
...who'll be taking Care
of Magical Creatures...

327
00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:45.928
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

328
00:30:47.764 --> 00:30:51.193
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

329
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:53.604
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

330
00:30:55.197 --> 00:30:58.447
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

331
00:30:59.803 --> 00:31:03.771
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr.
Filch, has asked me to remind you...

332
00:31:15.892 --> 00:31:18.398
She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.

333
00:31:19.189 --> 00:31:23.695
Thank you, headmaster, for
those kind words of welcome.

334
00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:29.684
And how lovely to see all your bright...

335
00:31:29.684 --> 00:31:32.530
...happy faces smiling up at me.

336
00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:37.726
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

337
00:31:38.843 --> 00:31:40.007
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

338
00:31:43.656 --> 00:31:46.476
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

339
00:31:46.685 --> 00:31:51.575
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

340
00:31:52.696 --> 00:31:54.757
Although each headmaster...

341
00:31:55.058 --> 00:31:58.413
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

342
00:32:01.685 --> 00:32:06.758
...progress for the sake of
progress must be discouraged.

343
00:32:08.437 --> 00:32:11.666
Let us preserve what must be preserved...

344
00:32:12.404 --> 00:32:14.978
...perfect what can be perfected...

345
00:32:15.979 --> 00:32:21.324
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

346
00:32:29.822 --> 00:32:33.949
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

347
00:32:34.414 --> 00:32:36.573
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

348
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.607
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

349
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.061
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

350
00:33:05.307 --> 00:33:05.959
Dean, Seamus.

351
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.388
- Good holiday?
- All right.

352
00:33:09.616 --> 00:33:10.647
Better than Seamus', anyway.

353
00:33:13.146 --> 00:33:14.661
My mum didn't want me to come back this year.

354
00:33:15.757 --> 00:33:18.535
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

355
00:33:19.302 --> 00:33:21.582
The Daily Prophet's been saying
a lot of things about you harry

356
00:33:21.776 --> 00:33:22.990
..... and about Dumbledore as well.

357
00:33:23.004 --> 00:33:24.240
What, your mum believes them?

358
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:26.205
Well nobody was there the night Cedric died.

359
00:33:26.205 --> 00:33:27.736
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then,

360
00:33:27.736 --> 00:33:29.934
like your stupid mother,
will tell you everything you need to know

361
00:33:29.934 --> 00:33:32.809
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.

362
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.110
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

363
00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:38.318
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?

364
00:33:38.685 --> 00:33:39.558
Yeah. I do.

365
00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:43.579
Has anyone else got a problem with Harry?

366
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.738
My grand says it's the day Prophet that's rubbish.

367
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.390
She's cancelled our subscription.

368
00:34:02.764 --> 00:34:03.765
- You all right?
- Fine.

369
00:34:05.187 --> 00:34:06.530
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

370
00:34:08.715 --> 00:34:11.467
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

371
00:34:16.091 --> 00:34:19.466
Right. I'll just leave
you to your thoughts, then.

372
00:34:49.088 --> 00:34:49.825
Harry.

373
00:35:05.594 --> 00:35:06.727
Bring it over here. Over here.

374
00:35:08.736 --> 00:35:10.107
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

375
00:35:27.074 --> 00:35:28.161
Good morning, children.

376
00:35:30.434 --> 00:35:34.882
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

377
00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:36.960
O-W-Ls.

378
00:35:38.959 --> 00:35:41.617
More commonly known as OWLs.

379
00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:46.196
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

380
00:35:46.739 --> 00:35:50.849
Fail to do so, and the
consequences may be severe.

381
00:35:57.691 --> 00:36:01.945
Your previous instruction in this
subject has been disturbingly uneven.

382
00:36:02.476 --> 00:36:04.570
But you'll be pleased to know, from now on...

383
00:36:04.808 --> 00:36:08.337
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...

384
00:36:08.817 --> 00:36:11.027
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

385
00:36:12.911 --> 00:36:14.773
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

386
00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.184
Using spells?

387
00:36:17.645 --> 00:36:20.349
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

388
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:23.458
We're not gonna use magic?

389
00:36:23.943 --> 00:36:28.944
You'll be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risk-free way.

390
00:36:29.427 --> 00:36:31.973
What use is that? If we're
attacked, it won't be risk-free.

391
00:36:32.253 --> 00:36:34.713
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

392
00:36:39.005 --> 00:36:40.753
It is the view of the Ministry...

393
00:36:41.649 --> 00:36:43.972
...that a theoretical
knowledge will be sufficient...

394
00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.971
...to get you through your examinations...

395
00:36:46.385 --> 00:36:49.067
...which, after all, is
what school is all about.

396
00:36:49.362 --> 00:36:52.018
And how's theory supposed to
prepare us for what's out there?

397
00:36:52.284 --> 00:36:53.784
There is nothing out there, dear.

398
00:36:54.472 --> 00:36:57.096
Who do you imagine wants to
attack children like yourself?

399
00:36:57.971 --> 00:37:00.244
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

400
00:37:11.505 --> 00:37:14.833
Now, let me make this quite plain.

401
00:37:16.568 --> 00:37:17.380
You have been told...

402
00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:22.807
...that a certain dark
wizard is at large once again.

403
00:37:23.598 --> 00:37:29.203
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

404
00:37:29.203 --> 00:37:30.285
Detention, Mr. Potter.

405
00:37:30.285 --> 00:37:32.839
So, according to you Cedric Diggory
dropped dead of his own accord?

406
00:37:32.839 --> 00:37:35.702
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.

407
00:37:35.936 --> 00:37:37.847
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.
you must know that.

408
00:37:38.038 --> 00:37:38.350
Enough!

409
00:37:40.285 --> 00:37:40.924
Enough.

410
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.943
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

411
00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:11.594
Come in.

412
00:38:17.658 --> 00:38:18.672
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

413
00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:20.211
Sit.

414
00:38:29.346 --> 00:38:31.509
You're going to be doing some
lines for me today, Mr. Potter.

415
00:38:33.286 --> 00:38:34.440
No, not with your quill.

416
00:38:35.456 --> 00:38:37.241
Going to be using a
rather special one of mine.

417
00:38:43.803 --> 00:38:44.126
Now...

418
00:38:46.172 --> 00:38:51.034
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."

419
00:38:54.017 --> 00:38:54.934
How many times?

420
00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:59.909
Well, let's say for as long as it
takes for the message to sink in.

421
00:39:03.023 --> 00:39:03.986
You haven't given me any ink.

422
00:39:05.064 --> 00:39:06.002
Oh, you won't need any ink.

423
00:39:57.625 --> 00:39:57.909
Yes?

424
00:40:06.316 --> 00:40:08.610
- Nothing.
- That's right.

425
00:40:10.657 --> 00:40:13.315
Because you know, deep down...

426
00:40:14.782 --> 00:40:16.221
...you deserve to be punished.

427
00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:19.492
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

428
00:40:24.626 --> 00:40:24.922
Go on.

429
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:37.263
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

430
00:40:37.659 --> 00:40:39.127
Get out of class whenever you like.

431
00:40:39.468 --> 00:40:41.857
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

432
00:40:44.517 --> 00:40:45.082
Care for another?

433
00:41:05.157 --> 00:41:07.058
- No cheat.
- Oh no you don't cheat.

434
00:41:11.361 --> 00:41:13.724
I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
- oh, please.

435
00:41:14.262 --> 00:41:16.650
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

436
00:41:17.951 --> 00:41:19.324
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

437
00:41:19.778 --> 00:41:22.984
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.

438
00:41:23.903 --> 00:41:26.797
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

439
00:41:32.813 --> 00:41:33.951
What's wrong with your hand?

440
00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:35.806
Nothing.

441
00:41:38.303 --> 00:41:39.134
The other hand.

442
00:41:42.461 --> 00:41:43.710
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

443
00:41:44.574 --> 00:41:46.243
Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.

444
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:48.752
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

445
00:41:49.462 --> 00:41:51.226
Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.

446
00:41:52.151 --> 00:41:54.919
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

447
00:41:58.289 --> 00:41:59.912
Harry, you've got to report this.

448
00:42:01.302 --> 00:42:03.787
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

449
00:42:05.024 --> 00:42:07.255
Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.

450
00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:09.928
You don't understand.

451
00:42:13.729 --> 00:42:14.290
Then help us to.

452
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:30.795
Dear Padfoot...

453
00:42:32.473 --> 00:42:33.583
...I hope you're all right.

454
00:42:34.562 --> 00:42:38.047
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

455
00:42:41.984 --> 00:42:45.297
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

456
00:42:47.534 --> 00:42:49.845
I know you, of all people, will understand.

457
00:43:24.705 --> 00:43:25.724
Hello, Harry Potter.

458
00:43:29.732 --> 00:43:31.673
- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
- Bit.

459
00:43:35.347 --> 00:43:37.936
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

460
00:43:39.922 --> 00:43:41.686
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

461
00:43:49.484 --> 00:43:52.129
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

462
00:43:53.734 --> 00:43:58.018
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

463
00:44:01.296 --> 00:44:02.248
Different.

464
00:44:06.532 --> 00:44:07.920
But why can't the others see them?

465
00:44:08.986 --> 00:44:11.160
They can only be seen by
people who've seen death.

466
00:44:14.484 --> 00:44:16.753
So you've known someone who's died, then?

467
00:44:17.452 --> 00:44:17.889
My mum.

468
00:44:19.579 --> 00:44:23.547
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

469
00:44:23.985 --> 00:44:26.755
...and one day, one of her
spells went badly wrong.

470
00:44:28.095 --> 00:44:29.859
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

471
00:44:31.045 --> 00:44:32.233
Yes, it was rather horrible.

472
00:44:33.461 --> 00:44:37.576
I do feel very sad about it
sometimes, but I've got Dad.

473
00:44:41.019 --> 00:44:42.436
We both believe you, by the way.

474
00:44:46.672 --> 00:44:49.467
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...

475
00:44:49.834 --> 00:44:52.188
...and the Ministry and the
Prophet are conspiring against you.

476
00:44:52.435 --> 00:44:56.583
Thanks. It seems you're
about the only ones that do.

477
00:44:57.723 --> 00:44:58.756
I don't think that's true.

478
00:45:01.359 --> 00:45:03.359
But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.

479
00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:05.378
What do you mean?

480
00:45:06.584 --> 00:45:07.889
Well, if I were
You-Know-Who...

481
00:45:09.138 --> 00:45:11.641
...I'd want you to feel cut
off from everyone else...

482
00:45:13.059 --> 00:45:14.524
...because if it's just you alone...

483
00:45:16.358 --> 00:45:17.734
...you're not as much of a threat.

484
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:40.493
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

485
00:45:44.693 --> 00:45:45.053
Harry.

486
00:45:47.553 --> 00:45:48.084
Can I join you?

487
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.848
Pardon me, professor, but what
exactly are you insinuating?

488
00:45:54.174 --> 00:45:56.379
I am merely requesting that
when it comes to my students...

489
00:45:57.065 --> 00:46:00.178
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

490
00:46:01.384 --> 00:46:02.601
So silly of me, but it sounds...

491
00:46:03.272 --> 00:46:06.456
...as if you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom...

492
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.971
...Minerva.

493
00:46:09.002 --> 00:46:12.972
Not at all, Dolores, merely
your medieval methods.

494
00:46:13.933 --> 00:46:15.727
I am sorry, dear.

495
00:46:16.568 --> 00:46:19.534
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

496
00:46:20.004 --> 00:46:22.430
...and by extension, the minister himself.

497
00:46:23.353 --> 00:46:24.244
I am a tolerant woman...

498
00:46:25.129 --> 00:46:29.024
...but the one thing I will
not stand for is disloyalty.

499
00:46:31.864 --> 00:46:32.317
Disloyalty.

500
00:46:35.362 --> 00:46:38.330
Things at Hogwarts are
far worse than I feared.

501
00:46:39.598 --> 00:46:42.113
Cornelius will want to take immediate action.

502
00:46:54.102 --> 00:46:55.395
What's happened to Dumbledore?

503
00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.029
Having already revolutionized...

504
00:46:59.298 --> 00:47:01.612
...the teaching of Defense
Against the Dark Arts...

505
00:47:02.561 --> 00:47:07.454
...Dolores Umbridge will, as
high inquisitor, have powers...

506
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:13.315
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

507
00:47:27.724 --> 00:47:32.068
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

508
00:47:32.568 --> 00:47:33.340
Yes.

509
00:47:35.654 --> 00:47:37.039
But you were unsuccessful?

510
00:47:39.507 --> 00:47:40.708
Obviously.

511
00:48:29.437 --> 00:48:31.252
Dream, Interpretation

512
00:48:32.126 --> 00:48:37.208
...is a most important means of divination
for the inner eye

513
00:48:37.626 --> 00:48:40.734
...see sights to witch  the outer world is blind.

514
00:48:56.677 --> 00:48:58.944
What are you doing here?

515
00:48:59.595 --> 00:49:00.555
Don't mind me dear.

516
00:49:01.221 --> 00:49:04.646
You see Professor Trelawney, Isn't it?

517
00:49:05.804 --> 00:49:08.509
In addition to my teaching duties
the Ministry has asked me ...

518
00:49:09.118 --> 00:49:11.906
to act as an informal observer
here at Hogwarts.

519
00:49:12.673 --> 00:49:15.953
Cornelius's eyes and ears as it were.

520
00:49:16.641 --> 00:49:19.405
Nothing what so ever to worry about
please do go on.

521
00:49:19.405 --> 00:49:20.776
I'm just fly on the wall.

522
00:49:21.651 --> 00:49:22.557
Oh.. Yes...

523
00:49:23.558 --> 00:49:24.275
Well...

524
00:49:26.528 --> 00:49:27.306
Dream...

525
00:49:27.306 --> 00:49:28.302
Just one question, dear.

526
00:49:29.327 --> 00:49:32.751
You've been in this post how long, exactly?

527
00:49:36.071 --> 00:49:37.807
Umm..  nearly 16 years.

528
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.214
Quite a period.

529
00:49:41.995 --> 00:49:45.913
And it was Dumbledore who appointed you?

530
00:49:46.756 --> 00:49:47.102
He did.

531
00:49:58.916 --> 00:50:01.155
- Interpretation...
- One more thing doesn't too much bother

532
00:50:02.076 --> 00:50:05.290
Could you please predict something for me?

533
00:50:07.592 --> 00:50:08.239
I'm sorry?

534
00:50:08.239 --> 00:50:09.409
Predict something.

535
00:50:10.579 --> 00:50:11.877
You sure you look surprise, I ask

536
00:50:13.491 --> 00:50:14.782
We would've foreseen it.

537
00:50:26.718 --> 00:50:28.981
The inner eye does not see upon command.

538
00:50:29.764 --> 00:50:30.625
Come on now.

539
00:50:31.467 --> 00:50:33.890
One teensy little prophecy?

540
00:50:39.668 --> 00:50:40.062
No...

541
00:50:48.013 --> 00:50:48.418
Pity.

542
00:50:50.732 --> 00:50:53.407
No, wait. Wait, no. I
think I do see something.

543
00:50:53.764 --> 00:50:55.793
Yes, I do. Something dark.

544
00:50:56.512 --> 00:51:00.200
You are in grave danger.

545
00:51:03.703 --> 00:51:04.908
Lovely.

546
00:51:16.915 --> 00:51:18.436
Cho. What's going on?

547
00:51:18.916 --> 00:51:20.574
It's Professor Trelawney.

548
00:51:51.558 --> 00:51:54.370
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.

549
00:51:55.155 --> 00:51:56.970
Hogwarts is my home.

550
00:51:59.157 --> 00:52:01.259
You can't do this.

551
00:52:03.012 --> 00:52:04.384
Actually, I can.

552
00:52:14.228 --> 00:52:15.509
Something you'd like to say?

553
00:52:15.904 --> 00:52:18.419
Oh, there are several
things I would like to say.

554
00:52:19.353 --> 00:52:19.716
There...

555
00:52:34.943 --> 00:52:39.028
Professor McGonagall, might I ask
you to escort Sybil back inside?

556
00:52:40.746 --> 00:52:42.699
Sybil, dear. This way.

557
00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:43.964
Thank you.

558
00:52:46.283 --> 00:52:49.980
Dumbledore, may I remind
you that under the terms...

559
00:52:50.231 --> 00:52:53.347
...of Educational Decree Number
23, as enacted by the minister...

560
00:52:53.887 --> 00:52:55.846
You have the right to dismiss my teachers.

561
00:52:57.201 --> 00:53:00.045
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

562
00:53:00.855 --> 00:53:02.699
That power remains with the headmaster.

563
00:53:04.951 --> 00:53:05.768
For now.

564
00:53:13.513 --> 00:53:14.887
Don't you all have studying to do?

565
00:53:15.894 --> 00:53:16.294
Professor.

566
00:53:18.062 --> 00:53:18.940
Professor?

567
00:53:20.387 --> 00:53:22.199
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

568
00:53:22.808 --> 00:53:24.055
Professor Dumbledore.

569
00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:37.539
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

570
00:53:38.412 --> 00:53:42.319
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

571
00:53:43.819 --> 00:53:45.662
She's taking over the entire school.

572
00:53:46.198 --> 00:53:50.688
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

573
00:53:51.074 --> 00:53:53.500
Furthermore, we have convincing evidence...

574
00:53:53.981 --> 00:53:56.011
...that these disappearances are the work...

575
00:53:56.324 --> 00:54:00.167
...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.

576
00:54:00.622 --> 00:54:01.072
Harry.

577
00:54:03.291 --> 00:54:03.574
Sirius.

578
00:54:05.606 --> 00:54:07.605
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

579
00:54:08.291 --> 00:54:10.636
You said you were worried about
Umbridge. What's she doing?

580
00:54:11.438 --> 00:54:13.340
Training you to kill half-breeds?

581
00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.261
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

582
00:54:16.978 --> 00:54:20.732
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

583
00:54:20.732 --> 00:54:21.322
Combat?

584
00:54:22.575 --> 00:54:24.698
What does he think, we're
forming some sort of wizard army?

585
00:54:25.017 --> 00:54:26.568
That's exactly what he thinks.

586
00:54:27.104 --> 00:54:30.253
That Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the Ministry.

587
00:54:31.822 --> 00:54:33.842
He's becoming more paranoid by the minute.

588
00:54:35.259 --> 00:54:38.573
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

589
00:54:39.356 --> 00:54:41.636
...but things aren't going
at all well with the Order.

590
00:54:42.558 --> 00:54:44.470
Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...

591
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:48.418
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

592
00:54:49.814 --> 00:54:52.322
Voldemort is on the move.

593
00:54:53.581 --> 00:54:54.544
Well, what can we do?

594
00:54:55.089 --> 00:54:56.231
Someone's coming.

595
00:54:57.438 --> 00:54:58.791
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

596
00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:03.636
But for now, at least, it
looks like you're on your own.

597
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.454
He really is out there, isn't he?

598
00:55:19.939 --> 00:55:21.876
We've got to be able to defend ourselves.

599
00:55:23.717 --> 00:55:26.343
And if Umbridge refuses to teach
us how, we need someone who will.

600
00:55:44.028 --> 00:55:45.166
Harry.

601
00:55:56.321 --> 00:55:58.601
This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?

602
00:55:58.601 --> 00:55:59.761
I'm a nutter, remember?

603
00:56:00.195 --> 00:56:03.163
Look on the bright side: you can't
be any worse than old toad face.

604
00:56:04.679 --> 00:56:07.118
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

605
00:56:08.836 --> 00:56:10.267
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

606
00:56:10.939 --> 00:56:12.160
Just a couple of people.

607
00:56:18.194 --> 00:56:19.053
Lovely spot.

608
00:56:23.929 --> 00:56:25.878
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

609
00:56:25.878 --> 00:56:26.766
Matey, come back here.

610
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:36.661
Hi.

611
00:56:38.024 --> 00:56:40.710
So you all know why we're here.

612
00:56:41.036 --> 00:56:42.253
We need a teacher.

613
00:56:43.424 --> 00:56:45.288
A proper teacher.

614
00:56:46.347 --> 00:56:49.298
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.

615
00:56:49.782 --> 00:56:50.815
- Why?
- Why?

616
00:56:51.468 --> 00:56:53.530
Because You-Know-Who's
back, you tosspot.

617
00:56:54.107 --> 00:56:55.595
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

618
00:56:55.889 --> 00:56:57.406
So Dumbledore says because he says.

619
00:56:58.078 --> 00:56:59.327
The point is, where's the proof?

620
00:57:02.193 --> 00:57:04.425
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

621
00:57:08.107 --> 00:57:11.172
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

622
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:14.437
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.

623
00:57:14.891 --> 00:57:17.442
Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?

624
00:57:21.641 --> 00:57:22.016
Yes.

625
00:57:24.327 --> 00:57:24.828
I've seen it.

626
00:57:26.266 --> 00:57:28.093
Blimey, Harry. I didn't
know you could do that.

627
00:57:29.107 --> 00:57:32.732
And he killed a basilisk, with
the sword in Dumbledore's office.

628
00:57:33.296 --> 00:57:33.662
It's true.

629
00:57:34.329 --> 00:57:36.297
Third year, he fought off about
a hundred Dementors at once.

630
00:57:38.972 --> 00:57:41.503
Last year, he really did fight
off You-Know-Who in the flesh.

631
00:57:41.503 --> 00:57:42.753
Wait.

632
00:57:43.594 --> 00:57:47.984
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

633
00:57:48.236 --> 00:57:50.779
...but the truth is, most
of that was just luck.

634
00:57:51.986 --> 00:57:54.833
I didn't know what I was doing half
the time. I nearly always had help.

635
00:57:56.031 --> 00:57:58.278
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

636
00:58:01.936 --> 00:58:06.060
Facing this stuff in real
life is not like school.

637
00:58:07.736 --> 00:58:10.627
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

638
00:58:10.864 --> 00:58:12.084
But out there...

639
00:58:13.487 --> 00:58:16.372
...when you're a second
away from being murdered...

640
00:58:16.967 --> 00:58:19.502
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

641
00:58:23.486 --> 00:58:24.643
You don't know what that's like.

642
00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:36.123
You're right, Harry, we don't.

643
00:58:37.684 --> 00:58:38.779
That's why we need your help.

644
00:58:39.636 --> 00:58:41.791
Because if we're going to
have any chance at beating...

645
00:58:44.733 --> 00:58:45.400
...Voldemort...

646
00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:50.242
He's really back.

647
00:59:13.259 --> 00:59:15.145
Right. First we need to
find a place to practice...

648
00:59:15.145 --> 00:59:16.586
...where Umbridge won't find out.

649
00:59:17.025 --> 00:59:18.380
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

650
00:59:19.472 --> 00:59:21.410
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

651
00:59:22.088 --> 00:59:24.462
Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?

652
00:59:24.847 --> 00:59:25.208
Who cares?

653
00:59:26.786 --> 00:59:30.505
I mean, it's sort of exciting,
isn't it, breaking the rules?

654
00:59:31.804 --> 00:59:33.466
Who are you and what have
you done with Hermione?

655
00:59:34.691 --> 00:59:37.472
Anyway, at least we know one
positive thing that came from today.

656
00:59:38.052 --> 00:59:38.943
What's that?

657
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:43.613
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?

658
00:59:46.773 --> 00:59:49.797
Right. Over the next few
days, we should each come up...

659
00:59:49.797 --> 00:59:52.190
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

660
00:59:53.365 --> 00:59:56.241
We've got to make sure, wherever it
is, there's no chance she can find us.

661
00:59:57.074 --> 00:59:57.945
Will do, Harry.

662
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:11.490
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

663
01:00:11.959 --> 01:00:15.199
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.

664
01:00:15.528 --> 01:00:16.950
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

665
01:00:54.305 --> 01:00:57.148
You've done it, Neville. You
found the Room of Requirement.

666
01:00:58.224 --> 01:00:59.229
The what?

667
01:00:59.887 --> 01:01:01.386
It's also known as the Come and Go Room.

668
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:04.731
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

669
01:01:05.476 --> 01:01:07.558
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

670
01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:11.383
So say you really needed the toilet...

671
01:01:13.838 --> 01:01:18.402
Charming, Ronald. But, yes,
that is the general idea.

672
01:01:18.858 --> 01:01:22.178
It's brilliant. It's like
Hogwarts wants us to fight back.

673
01:01:34.517 --> 01:01:35.011
Expelliarmus.

674
01:01:41.019 --> 01:01:41.910
I'm hopeless.

675
01:01:42.524 --> 01:01:46.759
You're just flourishing your wand too
much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

676
01:01:49.932 --> 01:01:53.264
You will please copy the
approved text four times...

677
01:01:54.307 --> 01:01:56.788
...to ensure maximum retention.

678
01:01:57.584 --> 01:02:00.870
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

679
01:02:01.139 --> 01:02:03.200
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.

680
01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:18.811
Stunning is one of the most
useful spells in your arsenal.

681
01:02:19.115 --> 01:02:21.171
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

682
01:02:21.531 --> 01:02:24.660
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

683
01:02:31.358 --> 01:02:32.140
Stupefy!

684
01:02:38.545 --> 01:02:41.721
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

685
01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:50.236
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

686
01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:51.729
Thanks, Ronald.

687
01:02:54.862 --> 01:02:56.477
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

688
01:02:57.970 --> 01:02:59.251
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

689
01:03:01.372 --> 01:03:02.544
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

690
01:03:09.823 --> 01:03:10.388
Stupefy.

691
01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:18.668
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

692
01:03:19.723 --> 01:03:23.190
I let her do that. It's
good manners, isn't it?

693
01:03:26.659 --> 01:03:28.106
It was completely intentional.

694
01:03:54.949 --> 01:03:57.371
Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?

695
01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:01.922
Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.

696
01:04:04.105 --> 01:04:05.074
Expelliarmus.

697
01:04:08.168 --> 01:04:09.326
Very good. Keep your concentration.

698
01:04:12.285 --> 01:04:12.973
Great.

699
01:04:15.356 --> 01:04:15.950
A little higher.

700
01:04:25.591 --> 01:04:26.902
I'm okay. I'm okay.

701
01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:47.702
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

702
01:05:08.027 --> 01:05:11.296
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

703
01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:14.032
...may sign up in the
high inquisitor's office.

704
01:05:14.847 --> 01:05:15.295
Diminuendo.

705
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:26.185
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

706
01:05:26.874 --> 01:05:27.974
Believing in yourself.

707
01:05:29.541 --> 01:05:30.917
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

708
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:32.252
Think of it this way.

709
01:05:33.076 --> 01:05:35.961
Every great wizard in
history has started out...

710
01:05:37.706 --> 01:05:40.610
...as nothing more than
what we are now: students.

711
01:05:41.624 --> 01:05:44.020
If they can do it, why not us?

712
01:05:54.404 --> 01:05:55.685
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

713
01:05:58.561 --> 01:05:59.077
Expelliarmus.

714
01:06:02.145 --> 01:06:02.943
Expelliarmus.

715
01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.546
Reducto.

716
01:06:24.879 --> 01:06:26.725
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

717
01:06:27.828 --> 01:06:28.596
Expelliarmus.

718
01:06:33.852 --> 01:06:34.479
Expelliarmus.

719
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.229
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

720
01:06:45.145 --> 01:06:46.835
So that's it for this lesson.

721
01:06:47.273 --> 01:06:49.457
Now, we' re not gonna be meeting
again until after the holidays.

722
01:06:51.195 --> 01:06:53.256
So just keep practicing on
your own as best you can.

723
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:56.354
And well done, everyone. Great, great work.

724
01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:02.928
Well done, mate.

725
01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:03.853
Thanks.

726
01:07:11.178 --> 01:07:12.629
See you after Christmas.

727
01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:24.504
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

728
01:07:26.468 --> 01:07:27.816
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

729
01:07:30.702 --> 01:07:33.102
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

730
01:07:33.102 --> 01:07:35.225
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

731
01:07:36.539 --> 01:07:38.134
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

732
01:07:38.134 --> 01:07:40.830
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

733
01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:42.760
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

734
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.655
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

735
01:07:46.102 --> 01:07:47.975
Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?

736
01:08:00.093 --> 01:08:04.164
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

737
01:08:04.808 --> 01:08:06.163
Yeah. I'm okay.

738
01:08:07.946 --> 01:08:09.593
Anyway, it's worth it.

739
01:08:16.137 --> 01:08:18.059
It's just, learning all this...

740
01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.758
...makes me wonder
whether, if he'd known it...

741
01:08:23.742 --> 01:08:25.434
Cedric did know this stuff.

742
01:08:26.976 --> 01:08:28.147
He was really good.

743
01:08:30.139 --> 01:08:31.759
It's just, Voldemort was better.

744
01:08:37.217 --> 01:08:38.557
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

745
01:08:40.570 --> 01:08:42.324
I've never been able to stun anything before.

746
01:08:52.451 --> 01:08:53.454
Mistletoe.

747
01:08:56.822 --> 01:08:58.994
Probably full of Nargles, though.

748
01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.336
What are Nargles?

749
01:09:02.576 --> 01:09:03.365
No idea.

750
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:28.248
Well, how was it?

751
01:09:28.991 --> 01:09:29.747
Wet.

752
01:09:31.726 --> 01:09:32.976
I mean, she was sort of crying.

753
01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.091
That bad at it, are you?

754
01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.009
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

755
01:09:41.813 --> 01:09:43.570
Cho spends half her time crying these days.

756
01:09:44.009 --> 01:09:45.890
You'd think a bit of
snogging would cheer her up.

757
01:09:47.612 --> 01:09:49.461
Don't you understand how she must be feeling?

758
01:09:55.188 --> 01:09:57.853
Well, obviously she's
feeling sad about Cedric...

759
01:09:58.872 --> 01:10:01.195
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

760
01:10:02.105 --> 01:10:04.788
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

761
01:10:04.788 --> 01:10:07.760
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

762
01:10:11.181 --> 01:10:13.780
One person couldn't feel
all that. They'd explode.

763
01:10:14.403 --> 01:10:16.857
Just because you've got the
emotional range of a teaspoon...

764
01:10:33.285 --> 01:10:34.250
Harry.

765
01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:46.083
Voldemort may be after something.

766
01:10:47.709 --> 01:10:49.781
Something he didn't have last time.

767
01:10:51.784 --> 01:10:52.171
Harry.

768
01:10:55.176 --> 01:10:55.548
Harry.

769
01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:29.516
In the dream, were you
standing next to the victim...

770
01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:31.965
...or looking down at the scene?

771
01:11:32.707 --> 01:11:34.433
Neither. It was like I...

772
01:11:36.014 --> 01:11:38.157
Professor will you please just tell me
what's happening?

773
01:11:38.258 --> 01:11:40.601
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

774
01:11:41.099 --> 01:11:42.607
Make sure he's found by the right people.

775
01:11:43.279 --> 01:11:43.960
- Sir.
- Phineas.

776
01:11:45.459 --> 01:11:47.371
You must go to your
portrait at Grimmauld Place.

777
01:11:47.834 --> 01:11:49.849
Tell them that Arthur
Weasley is gravely injured...

778
01:11:50.402 --> 01:11:53.413
...and his children will be
arriving there soon by Portkey.

779
01:11:55.085 --> 01:11:57.750
They've got him, Albus. It was
close, but they think he'll make it.

780
01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:00.399
What's more, the Dark
Lord failed to acquire it.

781
01:12:00.475 --> 01:12:02.652
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...

782
01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:03.990
Look at me!

783
01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.558
What's happening to me?

784
01:12:20.707 --> 01:12:22.771
You wished to see me, headmaster?

785
01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:26.923
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't
wait. Not even till the morning.

786
01:12:28.098 --> 01:12:29.727
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

787
01:12:35.706 --> 01:12:37.412
It appears there's a connection...

788
01:12:37.412 --> 01:12:39.458
...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.

789
01:12:40.371 --> 01:12:43.538
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

790
01:12:44.708 --> 01:12:46.849
Pray he remains ignorant.

791
01:12:47.959 --> 01:12:49.747
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

792
01:12:51.496 --> 01:12:54.428
- ... he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

793
01:12:56.051 --> 01:12:56.988
...unhinge it.

794
01:12:58.223 --> 01:13:01.461
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

795
01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:03.504
...to invade the minds of his victims...

796
01:13:03.944 --> 01:13:07.693
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

797
01:13:08.911 --> 01:13:13.808
Only after extracting the last
exquisite ounce of agony...

798
01:13:14.067 --> 01:13:17.350
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

799
01:13:18.239 --> 01:13:18.866
...kill them.

800
01:13:20.506 --> 01:13:23.098
Used properly, the power of Occlumency...

801
01:13:23.305 --> 01:13:25.115
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

802
01:13:26.649 --> 01:13:31.113
In these lessons, I will
attempt to penetrate your mind.

803
01:13:32.146 --> 01:13:34.086
You will attempt to resist.

804
01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:35.895
Prepare yourself.

805
01:13:39.684 --> 01:13:40.931
Legilimens.

806
01:13:42.113 --> 01:13:42.489
Harry.

807
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.799
Is she dead?

808
01:13:49.041 --> 01:13:51.972
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

809
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:22.068
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

810
01:14:22.392 --> 01:14:23.352
Here we go.

811
01:14:24.098 --> 01:14:25.004
Daddy's back.

812
01:14:29.425 --> 01:14:32.647
Sit down, everybody, sit
down. That's it. Now, presents.

813
01:14:33.487 --> 01:14:36.976
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

814
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:42.335
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

815
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:44.273
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

816
01:14:45.349 --> 01:14:47.468
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

817
01:14:48.028 --> 01:14:51.569
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

818
01:14:52.339 --> 01:14:54.595
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

819
01:14:55.037 --> 01:14:56.067
Oh, Harry, Harry.

820
01:14:57.681 --> 01:14:58.429
There you are.

821
01:15:00.572 --> 01:15:01.929
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

822
01:15:02.869 --> 01:15:04.397
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

823
01:15:04.997 --> 01:15:06.053
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

824
01:15:07.055 --> 01:15:08.371
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

825
01:15:08.741 --> 01:15:09.616
Fred? George?

826
01:15:10.442 --> 01:15:11.651
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

827
01:15:12.849 --> 01:15:13.762
To Mr. Harry Potter...

828
01:15:16.114 --> 01:15:18.647
...without whom I would not be here.

829
01:15:21.963 --> 01:15:23.945
- Harry.
- Harry.

830
01:15:24.743 --> 01:15:25.099
Harry.

831
01:15:27.442 --> 01:15:30.387
That is delicious. I shall
be needing some more of that.

832
01:15:31.012 --> 01:15:32.386
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

833
01:15:33.302 --> 01:15:35.411
I can't understand why you
don't want to wear it, Ronald.

834
01:15:37.542 --> 01:15:39.242
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

835
01:15:39.538 --> 01:15:40.430
No more than usual, Ron.

836
01:15:41.507 --> 01:15:42.130
I don't know why...

837
01:15:49.386 --> 01:15:52.856
Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.

838
01:15:54.145 --> 01:15:57.966
Harry Potter, the boy
who stopped the Dark Lord.

839
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.920
Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.

840
01:16:02.794 --> 01:16:04.395
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

841
01:16:05.342 --> 01:16:07.952
That's enough of your bile. Away with you!

842
01:16:08.515 --> 01:16:09.669
Of course, master.

843
01:16:10.422 --> 01:16:13.702
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

844
01:16:17.437 --> 01:16:18.192
Sorry about that.

845
01:16:19.834 --> 01:16:22.411
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

846
01:16:23.918 --> 01:16:24.873
Not to me, anyway.

847
01:16:26.169 --> 01:16:28.295
What, you grew up here?

848
01:16:28.997 --> 01:16:30.066
This is my parents' house.

849
01:16:31.608 --> 01:16:34.396
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

850
01:16:36.606 --> 01:16:38.642
About the only useful
thing I've been able to do.

851
01:16:41.278 --> 01:16:42.922
This is the Black family tree.

852
01:16:44.538 --> 01:16:45.669
My deranged cousin.

853
01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:48.191
I hated the lot of them.

854
01:16:49.436 --> 01:16:53.074
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

855
01:16:57.607 --> 01:17:00.233
My mother did that after I ran away.

856
01:17:03.756 --> 01:17:04.436
Charming woman.

857
01:17:06.733 --> 01:17:07.392
I was 16.

858
01:17:09.107 --> 01:17:09.857
Where did you go?

859
01:17:12.981 --> 01:17:13.731
Round your dad's.

860
01:17:15.494 --> 01:17:16.999
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

861
01:17:18.796 --> 01:17:20.465
I see him so much in you, Harry.

862
01:17:22.092 --> 01:17:23.655
You are so very much alike.

863
01:17:24.825 --> 01:17:25.833
I'm not so sure.

864
01:17:28.453 --> 01:17:29.983
Sirius, when I was...

865
01:17:32.626 --> 01:17:36.389
When I saw Mr. Weasley
attacked, I wasn't just watching.

866
01:17:38.528 --> 01:17:39.106
I was the snake.

867
01:17:40.982 --> 01:17:43.450
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...

868
01:17:43.999 --> 01:17:46.919
...there was a moment when I wanted to...

869
01:17:53.374 --> 01:17:55.904
This connection between me and Voldemort.

870
01:17:56.966 --> 01:18:00.404
What if the reason for it is
that I am becoming more like him?

871
01:18:00.982 --> 01:18:05.669
I just feel so angry all the time.

872
01:18:06.872 --> 01:18:10.406
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

873
01:18:11.608 --> 01:18:14.819
...something's gone wrong inside
me? What if I'm becoming bad?

874
01:18:17.779 --> 01:18:19.879
I want you to listen to
me very carefully, Harry.

875
01:18:22.046 --> 01:18:24.311
You're not a bad person.

876
01:18:26.187 --> 01:18:29.294
You're a very good person who
bad things have happened to.

877
01:18:30.968 --> 01:18:31.937
You understand?

878
01:18:34.106 --> 01:18:39.532
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

879
01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.731
We've all got both light
and dark inside of us.

880
01:18:44.749 --> 01:18:46.674
What matters is the part we choose to act on.

881
01:18:49.831 --> 01:18:50.985
That's who we really are.

882
01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:56.986
Harry, time to go.

883
01:18:59.546 --> 01:19:02.435
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

884
01:19:03.473 --> 01:19:04.322
You'll see.

885
01:19:45.033 --> 01:19:45.960
Really?

886
01:19:46.682 --> 01:19:48.204
Harry. Harry.

887
01:19:49.123 --> 01:19:50.081
Hagrid's back.

888
01:19:54.305 --> 01:19:54.859
I'm sorry.

889
01:20:10.604 --> 01:20:12.307
I will say this one last time.

890
01:20:13.745 --> 01:20:15.985
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.

891
01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:19.140
I told you. I've been away for my health.

892
01:20:19.869 --> 01:20:23.246
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

893
01:20:24.198 --> 01:20:28.528
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh
air must be difficult to come by.

894
01:20:31.169 --> 01:20:33.746
If I were you, I shouldn't
get too used to being back.

895
01:20:33.993 --> 01:20:36.557
In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.

896
01:20:55.705 --> 01:20:57.829
This is top-secret, right?

897
01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.865
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.

898
01:21:02.255 --> 01:21:02.628
Giants?

899
01:21:05.203 --> 01:21:05.706
You found them?

900
01:21:06.391 --> 01:21:09.984
Well, they're not that hard to find, to
be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

901
01:21:11.173 --> 01:21:13.580
I tried to convince them to join the cause.

902
01:21:14.431 --> 01:21:16.705
But I wasn't the only one that
was trying to win them over.

903
01:21:17.785 --> 01:21:18.969
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

904
01:21:20.194 --> 01:21:22.578
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

905
01:21:23.207 --> 01:21:25.859
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

906
01:21:26.472 --> 01:21:29.193
Suppose some of them remember he
was friendly to them. I suppose.

907
01:21:33.696 --> 01:21:35.141
And they did this to you?

908
01:21:36.348 --> 01:21:36.940
Not exactly, no.

909
01:21:39.204 --> 01:21:41.658
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.

910
01:21:56.305 --> 01:21:57.337
It's changing out there.

911
01:21:58.568 --> 01:21:59.954
Just like last time.

912
01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:03.254
There's a storm coming, Harry.

913
01:22:04.365 --> 01:22:06.190
We'd all best be ready when she does.

914
01:22:44.530 --> 01:22:47.269
We have confirmed that 10
high-security prisoners...

915
01:22:47.577 --> 01:22:50.188
...in the early hours of
yesterday evening did escape.

916
01:22:50.661 --> 01:22:53.957
And of course, the Muggle prime
minister has been alerted to the danger.

917
01:22:54.533 --> 01:22:56.126
We strongly suspect...

918
01:22:57.435 --> 01:22:59.285
...that the breakout was engineered...

919
01:22:59.563 --> 01:23:03.186
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

920
01:23:03.985 --> 01:23:07.938
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

921
01:23:09.093 --> 01:23:12.406
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.

922
01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:25.913
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.

923
01:23:26.643 --> 01:23:29.121
He's gonna get us all killed just
because he can't face the truth.

924
01:23:29.787 --> 01:23:30.613
Harry.

925
01:23:33.144 --> 01:23:36.033
I wanted to apologize.

926
01:23:37.594 --> 01:23:40.613
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

927
01:23:42.109 --> 01:23:46.514
So, what I'm really trying
to say is that I believe you.

928
01:23:54.437 --> 01:23:55.344
Neville?

929
01:24:08.935 --> 01:24:09.837
Fourteen years ago...

930
01:24:11.324 --> 01:24:14.310
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...

931
01:24:15.742 --> 01:24:17.853
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

932
01:24:19.405 --> 01:24:21.949
She tortured them for information...

933
01:24:22.883 --> 01:24:24.508
...but they never gave in.

934
01:24:27.446 --> 01:24:28.657
I'm quite proud to be their son.

935
01:24:30.824 --> 01:24:33.697
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

936
01:24:40.509 --> 01:24:43.634
We're gonna make them proud,
Neville. That's a promise.

937
01:24:49.087 --> 01:24:52.601
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

938
01:24:52.903 --> 01:24:55.194
Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.

939
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:57.551
George, your turn now.

940
01:24:59.279 --> 01:25:00.372
Expecto Patronum.

941
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:05.458
A full-bodied Patronus is the
most difficult to produce...

942
01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:10.007
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

943
01:25:10.007 --> 01:25:11.159
Wow, that was really good.

944
01:25:11.942 --> 01:25:12.931
Fantastic, Ginny.

945
01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:17.928
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

946
01:25:18.161 --> 01:25:19.098
So focus, Luna.

947
01:25:24.069 --> 01:25:25.802
Think of the happiest thing you can.

948
01:25:25.802 --> 01:25:26.522
Expecto Patronum.

949
01:25:28.238 --> 01:25:29.898
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

950
01:25:31.378 --> 01:25:34.178
This is really advanced stuff,
guys. You're doing so well.

951
01:25:36.162 --> 01:25:37.130
Expecto Patronum.

952
01:26:20.137 --> 01:26:21.611
I'll make short work of this.

953
01:26:24.109 --> 01:26:25.762
Bombarda Maxima.

954
01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:44.558
Get them.

955
01:26:46.424 --> 01:26:47.543
Been watching them for weeks.

956
01:26:47.798 --> 01:26:49.700
And see, " Dumbledore's Army"...

957
01:26:50.197 --> 01:26:53.636
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

958
01:26:55.318 --> 01:26:57.532
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

959
01:26:57.532 --> 01:26:59.372
...never fooled us for a minute.

960
01:26:59.372 --> 01:27:01.138
We saw your lies for what they were:

961
01:27:01.448 --> 01:27:04.464
A smokescreen for your bid to
seize control of the Ministry.

962
01:27:05.078 --> 01:27:05.798
Naturally.

963
01:27:06.532 --> 01:27:08.596
No, professor. He had nothing
to do with it. It was me.

964
01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:12.700
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield
me, but as has been pointed out...

965
01:27:13.308 --> 01:27:17.043
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

966
01:27:18.215 --> 01:27:20.034
I instructed Harry to form this organization.

967
01:27:20.999 --> 01:27:24.513
And I, and I alone, am
responsible for its activities.

968
01:27:24.846 --> 01:27:26.464
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.

969
01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:28.595
If we hurry, we should still
make the morning edition.

970
01:27:29.297 --> 01:27:32.935
Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you
will escort Dumbledore...

971
01:27:34.339 --> 01:27:35.139
...to Azkaban...

972
01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:41.466
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.

973
01:27:41.811 --> 01:27:44.137
I thought we might hit this little snag.

974
01:27:46.748 --> 01:27:49.200
You seem to be laboring under
the delusion that I'm going to...

975
01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:51.297
What was the phrase?

976
01:27:52.094 --> 01:27:52.660
...come quietly.

977
01:27:53.871 --> 01:27:54.921
Well, I can tell you this:

978
01:27:55.832 --> 01:27:58.250
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

979
01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:59.323
Enough of this.

980
01:28:00.279 --> 01:28:00.590
Take him.

981
01:28:15.815 --> 01:28:17.127
Well, you may not like him, minister...

982
01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:19.401
...but you can't deny...

983
01:28:21.185 --> 01:28:22.589
...Dumbledore has got style.

984
01:28:47.894 --> 01:28:52.230
Boys and girls are not permitted to
be within eight inches of each other.

985
01:28:53.042 --> 01:28:56.410
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

986
01:28:56.668 --> 01:29:00.481
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

987
01:29:01.979 --> 01:29:04.888
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.

988
01:30:17.095 --> 01:30:17.581
Harry.

989
01:30:26.232 --> 01:30:28.887
You did everything you could. No
one could win against that old hag.

990
01:30:29.481 --> 01:30:30.887
Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.

991
01:30:32.528 --> 01:30:34.167
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

992
01:30:35.045 --> 01:30:36.511
Yeah, we talked you into it.

993
01:30:37.401 --> 01:30:38.198
Yeah, but I agreed.

994
01:30:39.683 --> 01:30:42.857
I tried so hard to help, and all
it's done is make things worse.

995
01:30:45.878 --> 01:30:47.285
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

996
01:30:49.339 --> 01:30:52.685
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

997
01:30:53.648 --> 01:30:55.702
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

998
01:30:56.782 --> 01:30:58.355
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

999
01:31:02.230 --> 01:31:03.013
To go it alone.

1000
01:31:10.042 --> 01:31:10.496
Hagrid.

1001
01:31:15.902 --> 01:31:16.966
Any idea where he's taking us?

1002
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:20.183
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

1003
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:31.483
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

1004
01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.989
And they're dangerous at the best of times.

1005
01:31:36.153 --> 01:31:38.263
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

1006
01:31:38.547 --> 01:31:40.750
...they'll have a full
uprising on their hands.

1007
01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.091
Hagrid, what's going on?

1008
01:31:42.796 --> 01:31:44.640
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

1009
01:31:45.246 --> 01:31:48.812
I wouldn't be bothering you at all
with it, but with Dumbledore gone...

1010
01:31:50.906 --> 01:31:53.544
...I'll likely be getting
the sack any day now.

1011
01:31:54.330 --> 01:31:56.686
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

1012
01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:02.579
Grawpy.

1013
01:32:06.062 --> 01:32:07.514
Down here, you great buffoon.

1014
01:32:14.372 --> 01:32:14.848
Grawpy.

1015
01:32:16.997 --> 01:32:17.990
Brought you some company.

1016
01:32:31.028 --> 01:32:32.263
I couldn't just leave him, because...

1017
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:34.421
Because he's my brother.

1018
01:32:35.264 --> 01:32:35.747
Blimey.

1019
01:32:36.499 --> 01:32:37.514
Well, half brother, really.

1020
01:32:38.778 --> 01:32:43.358
He's completely harmless, just like
I said. Little high-spirited, is all.

1021
01:32:46.231 --> 01:32:48.294
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

1022
01:32:48.764 --> 01:32:50.561
We talked about this. You do not grab, do you?

1023
01:32:51.222 --> 01:32:53.312
That's your new friend, Hermione.

1024
01:32:53.746 --> 01:32:54.200
Grawpy.

1025
01:32:59.286 --> 01:32:59.488
Grawp.

1026
01:33:01.988 --> 01:33:04.055
Put me down.

1027
01:33:09.146 --> 01:33:09.349
Now.

1028
01:33:23.058 --> 01:33:23.529
You all right?

1029
01:33:25.089 --> 01:33:26.339
Fine.

1030
01:33:27.414 --> 01:33:28.727
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1031
01:33:30.055 --> 01:33:31.195
I think you've got an admirer.

1032
01:33:34.812 --> 01:33:36.307
You just stay away from her, all right?

1033
01:34:07.305 --> 01:34:08.325
He gets his own food and all.

1034
01:34:11.072 --> 01:34:12.742
It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.

1035
01:34:15.587 --> 01:34:16.743
You will look after him, won't you?

1036
01:34:18.369 --> 01:34:19.647
I'm the only family he's got.

1037
01:34:34.513 --> 01:34:35.838
Feeling sentimental?

1038
01:34:39.541 --> 01:34:42.323
- That's private.
- Not to me.

1039
01:34:43.684 --> 01:34:46.528
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1040
01:34:49.681 --> 01:34:52.728
Every memory he has access to is
a weapon he can use against you.

1041
01:34:52.728 --> 01:34:55.606
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1042
01:34:58.093 --> 01:34:59.516
You're just like your father.

1043
01:35:00.591 --> 01:35:02.261
Lazy, arrogant.

1044
01:35:02.557 --> 01:35:04.746
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

1045
01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:06.762
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

1046
01:35:07.712 --> 01:35:09.136
Control your emotions.

1047
01:35:09.622 --> 01:35:11.103
Discipline your mind.

1048
01:35:15.575 --> 01:35:16.141
Legilimens.

1049
01:35:24.076 --> 01:35:24.458
Harry.

1050
01:35:25.063 --> 01:35:25.864
Sirius.

1051
01:35:27.845 --> 01:35:28.689
I may vomit.

1052
01:35:29.388 --> 01:35:29.719
Stop it.

1053
01:35:31.670 --> 01:35:33.184
Is this what you call control?

1054
01:35:34.356 --> 01:35:35.999
We've been at it for
hours. If I could just rest.

1055
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:40.027
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1056
01:35:42.653 --> 01:35:44.481
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1057
01:35:44.795 --> 01:35:48.293
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.

1058
01:35:48.293 --> 01:35:52.199
Well, it may have escaped your
notice, but life isn't fair.

1059
01:35:52.404 --> 01:35:55.920
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1060
01:35:56.232 --> 01:35:59.124
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1061
01:36:00.565 --> 01:36:02.140
- Legilimens.
- Protego.

1062
01:36:07.747 --> 01:36:08.763
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1063
01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:11.045
Snape. Expelliarmus.

1064
01:36:11.877 --> 01:36:12.497
Nice one, James.

1065
01:36:14.278 --> 01:36:15.019
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.

1066
01:36:15.359 --> 01:36:18.015
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

1067
01:36:18.263 --> 01:36:21.013
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1068
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:23.741
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

1069
01:36:23.741 --> 01:36:24.324
Enough.

1070
01:36:27.064 --> 01:36:27.684
Enough.

1071
01:36:37.032 --> 01:36:39.003
Your lessons are at an end.

1072
01:36:39.496 --> 01:36:39.864
I...

1073
01:36:40.169 --> 01:36:41.129
Get out.

1074
01:37:01.610 --> 01:37:03.219
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1075
01:37:03.608 --> 01:37:05.063
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1076
01:37:05.797 --> 01:37:08.267
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1077
01:37:09.171 --> 01:37:10.141
It's fading already.

1078
01:37:11.397 --> 01:37:14.735
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1079
01:37:23.579 --> 01:37:25.342
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1080
01:37:26.428 --> 01:37:28.833
...naughty children deserve to be punished.

1081
01:37:33.008 --> 01:37:34.593
You know, George...

1082
01:37:34.593 --> 01:37:37.594
...I've always felt our futures lay
outside the world of academic achievement.

1083
01:37:38.546 --> 01:37:41.844
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1084
01:39:05.015 --> 01:39:05.840
Here you go.

1085
01:39:31.863 --> 01:39:32.727
Ready when you are.

1086
01:41:21.117 --> 01:41:23.355
I need that prophecy.

1087
01:41:24.499 --> 01:41:25.839
You'll have to kill me.

1088
01:41:27.086 --> 01:41:30.776
Oh, I will. But first,
you will fetch it for me.

1089
01:41:31.759 --> 01:41:32.085
Crucio.

1090
01:41:35.882 --> 01:41:36.447
Crucio.

1091
01:41:49.035 --> 01:41:49.742
Sirius.

1092
01:41:50.977 --> 01:41:51.837
Harry, are you sure?

1093
01:41:52.171 --> 01:41:54.135
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.

1094
01:41:54.649 --> 01:41:56.213
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1095
01:41:56.213 --> 01:41:57.913
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.

1096
01:41:58.525 --> 01:42:00.399
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.

1097
01:42:00.977 --> 01:42:04.023
Something he didn't have the last
time, in the Department of Mysteries.

1098
01:42:04.023 --> 01:42:05.567
Harry, please, just listen.

1099
01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.585
What if Voldemort meant for you to see this?

1100
01:42:11.337 --> 01:42:13.777
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1101
01:42:14.172 --> 01:42:17.000
What if he is? I'm supposed
to just let him die?

1102
01:42:18.257 --> 01:42:20.463
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.

1103
01:42:24.411 --> 01:42:25.392
What do we do?

1104
01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:28.202
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1105
01:42:28.202 --> 01:42:30.308
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.

1106
01:42:30.601 --> 01:42:31.181
Not all of them.

1107
01:42:35.096 --> 01:42:35.801
Alohomora.

1108
01:42:47.699 --> 01:42:48.746
Alert the Order if you can.

1109
01:42:49.593 --> 01:42:51.687
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

1110
01:42:53.341 --> 01:42:56.704
When are you going to get it into
your head? We're in this together.

1111
01:42:57.156 --> 01:42:58.827
That you are.

1112
01:43:00.513 --> 01:43:02.247
Caught this one trying
to help the Weasley girl.

1113
01:43:08.268 --> 01:43:09.910
You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?

1114
01:43:10.639 --> 01:43:11.876
- No.
- Liar.

1115
01:43:13.029 --> 01:43:15.497
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1116
01:43:16.077 --> 01:43:19.122
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1117
01:43:19.831 --> 01:43:21.191
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1118
01:43:21.466 --> 01:43:24.345
I'm afraid you've used up all
my stores interrogating students.

1119
01:43:24.719 --> 01:43:26.389
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1120
01:43:31.871 --> 01:43:33.046
Unless you wish to poison him...

1121
01:43:33.372 --> 01:43:36.392
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1122
01:43:38.547 --> 01:43:39.334
...I cannot help you.

1123
01:43:42.841 --> 01:43:43.715
He's got Padfoot.

1124
01:43:44.833 --> 01:43:47.825
He's got Padfoot at the
place where it's hidden.

1125
01:43:49.518 --> 01:43:51.580
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1126
01:43:51.796 --> 01:43:52.856
What is he talking about, Snape?

1127
01:43:59.622 --> 01:44:00.733
No idea.

1128
01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:06.892
Very well.

1129
01:44:09.053 --> 01:44:10.445
You give me no choice, Potter.

1130
01:44:11.871 --> 01:44:14.621
As this is an issue of Ministry security...

1131
01:44:14.621 --> 01:44:15.968
...you leave me with...

1132
01:44:17.507 --> 01:44:18.420
...no alternative.

1133
01:44:20.673 --> 01:44:22.818
The Cruciatus Curse ought
to loosen your tongue.

1134
01:44:22.818 --> 01:44:23.881
That's illegal.

1135
01:44:23.881 --> 01:44:26.808
What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.

1136
01:44:34.757 --> 01:44:35.343
Tell her, Harry!

1137
01:44:37.639 --> 01:44:38.259
Tell me what?

1138
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:41.887
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1139
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.796
...I will.

1140
01:44:46.457 --> 01:44:47.921
Where what is?

1141
01:44:49.646 --> 01:44:50.729
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1142
01:44:56.832 --> 01:44:57.901
How much further?

1143
01:44:58.683 --> 01:44:59.638
Not far.

1144
01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:04.899
It had to be somewhere students
wouldn't find it accidentally.

1145
01:45:10.538 --> 01:45:11.509
What are you doing?

1146
01:45:12.029 --> 01:45:12.818
Improvising.

1147
01:45:20.528 --> 01:45:21.778
Well?

1148
01:45:23.058 --> 01:45:24.102
Where is this weapon?

1149
01:45:30.445 --> 01:45:31.601
There isn't one, is there?

1150
01:45:35.064 --> 01:45:36.322
You were trying to trick me.

1151
01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:44.871
You know...

1152
01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:45.906
...I really hate children.

1153
01:45:48.216 --> 01:45:52.248
You really are most untidy creature.

1154
01:45:53.809 --> 01:45:55.539
Lord knows I tried to help you ...

1155
01:45:57.116 --> 01:46:00.794
....to understand discipline
and respect for decorum

1156
01:46:01.133 --> 01:46:04.446
I tried my very best to bring order

1157
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:09.124
yet at every time it ends by chaos

1158
01:46:11.536 --> 01:46:12.047
I mean..

1159
01:46:12.047 --> 01:46:13.785
look what you've done to me

1160
01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:17.326
I can not take it anymore.

1161
01:46:19.093 --> 01:46:19.576
I must ..

1162
01:46:20.906 --> 01:46:23.732
Authority must be appalled

1163
01:46:25.552 --> 01:46:30.738
sometimes the ends do justify the meanings

1164
01:46:31.832 --> 01:46:32.264
Not acjuctly

1165
01:46:33.436 --> 01:46:34.517
No one can blame me

1166
01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:38.153
and if its falls to me to sort out

1167
01:46:39.113 --> 01:46:42.531
Yes... To tie up a new sense then soap it.

1168
01:46:44.903 --> 01:46:50.519
For the greater good I will do what must be done.

1169
01:47:05.558 --> 01:47:08.792
You have no business here,
centaur. This is a Ministry matter.

1170
01:47:12.854 --> 01:47:13.823
Lower your weapons.

1171
01:47:14.684 --> 01:47:19.410
I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...

1172
01:47:19.812 --> 01:47:20.576
Protego.

1173
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:22.569
How dare you?

1174
01:47:23.622 --> 01:47:24.720
Filthy half-breed.

1175
01:47:25.655 --> 01:47:26.420
Incarcerous.

1176
01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:41.723
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1177
01:47:42.855 --> 01:47:46.687
Now, enough. I will have order.

1178
01:47:57.548 --> 01:47:58.281
You filthy animal.

1179
01:47:58.986 --> 01:48:01.484
Do you know who I am?

1180
01:48:03.003 --> 01:48:04.444
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1181
01:48:05.303 --> 01:48:06.646
No, he doesn't understand.

1182
01:48:14.984 --> 01:48:17.751
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1183
01:48:18.437 --> 01:48:19.393
I'm sorry, professor.

1184
01:48:20.595 --> 01:48:22.017
But I must not tell lies.

1185
01:48:22.017 --> 01:48:23.125
What are you doing?

1186
01:48:23.628 --> 01:48:27.330
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1187
01:48:27.922 --> 01:48:29.086
Let me go!

1188
01:48:32.687 --> 01:48:33.685
Thank you, Grawp.

1189
01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:36.814
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1190
01:48:46.485 --> 01:48:49.666
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1191
01:48:50.375 --> 01:48:52.242
Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.

1192
01:48:52.883 --> 01:48:54.978
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1193
01:48:55.667 --> 01:48:56.788
That was clever, Ron.

1194
01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:00.213
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

1195
01:49:01.065 --> 01:49:02.297
So how are we getting to London?

1196
01:49:04.038 --> 01:49:06.865
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1197
01:49:07.297 --> 01:49:10.018
...but I've got you into
enough trouble as it is.

1198
01:49:11.434 --> 01:49:13.602
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to
be about doing something real.

1199
01:49:14.885 --> 01:49:16.364
Or was that all just words to you?

1200
01:49:18.918 --> 01:49:20.920
Maybe you don't have to do
this all by yourself, mate.

1201
01:49:26.824 --> 01:49:28.140
So how are we going to get to London?

1202
01:49:30.264 --> 01:49:31.473
We fly, of course.

1203
01:50:24.013 --> 01:50:25.568
Department of Mysteries.

1204
01:50:34.496 --> 01:50:34.966
This is it.

1205
01:51:29.653 --> 01:51:31.591
Ninety-two.
Ninety-three.

1206
01:51:33.007 --> 01:51:33.983
Ninety-four.

1207
01:51:35.844 --> 01:51:36.992
Ninety-five.

1208
01:51:49.744 --> 01:51:51.999
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1209
01:51:55.003 --> 01:51:56.424
It's got your name on it.

1210
01:52:21.318 --> 01:52:25.352
The one with the power to
vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1211
01:52:26.831 --> 01:52:29.224
And the Dark Lord shall
mark him as his equal...

1212
01:52:29.425 --> 01:52:31.894
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1213
01:52:37.995 --> 01:52:41.681
For neither can live while the other survives.

1214
01:52:45.744 --> 01:52:46.051
Harry.

1215
01:52:57.524 --> 01:52:58.358
Where's Sirius?

1216
01:52:59.116 --> 01:53:02.363
You know, you really should learn to
tell the difference between dreams...

1217
01:53:06.986 --> 01:53:07.656
...and reality.

1218
01:53:10.704 --> 01:53:14.314
You saw only what the Dark
Lord wanted you to see.

1219
01:53:16.141 --> 01:53:17.360
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1220
01:53:17.662 --> 01:53:19.381
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1221
01:53:22.656 --> 01:53:23.971
He knows how to play.

1222
01:53:25.092 --> 01:53:28.267
Itty, bitty baby.

1223
01:53:29.399 --> 01:53:29.957
Potter.

1224
01:53:31.271 --> 01:53:32.131
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1225
01:53:33.329 --> 01:53:36.064
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?

1226
01:53:36.456 --> 01:53:37.914
Better, now they're about to be avenged.

1227
01:53:41.581 --> 01:53:45.648
Now, let's everybody just calm down...

1228
01:53:46.531 --> 01:53:46.938
...shall we?

1229
01:53:48.158 --> 01:53:50.266
All we want is that prophecy.

1230
01:53:50.768 --> 01:53:52.559
Why did Voldemort need
me to come and get this?

1231
01:53:53.025 --> 01:53:54.296
You dare speak his name?

1232
01:53:56.173 --> 01:53:57.609
You filthy half-blood!

1233
01:53:58.094 --> 01:54:00.095
It's all right. He's just
a curious lad, aren't you?

1234
01:54:02.468 --> 01:54:06.907
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1235
01:54:08.126 --> 01:54:10.049
Which is lucky for you, really.

1236
01:54:14.676 --> 01:54:16.130
Haven't you always wondered...

1237
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.177
...what was the reason for the
connection between you and the Dark Lord?

1238
01:54:22.984 --> 01:54:24.658
Why he was unable to kill you...

1239
01:54:25.678 --> 01:54:27.531
...when you were just an infant?

1240
01:54:29.571 --> 01:54:33.765
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1241
01:54:35.331 --> 01:54:39.160
All the answers are there,
Potter, in your hand.

1242
01:54:40.817 --> 01:54:41.565
All you have to do...

1243
01:54:43.345 --> 01:54:44.218
...is give it to me.

1244
01:54:45.759 --> 01:54:47.584
Then I can show you everything.

1245
01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:58.892
I've waited 14 years.

1246
01:55:00.143 --> 01:55:00.459
I know.

1247
01:55:02.735 --> 01:55:05.409
I guess I can wait a
little longer. Now. Stupefy.

1248
01:55:05.817 --> 01:55:06.144
Stupefy.

1249
01:55:23.504 --> 01:55:24.243
Levicorpus.

1250
01:55:31.018 --> 01:55:31.984
Petrificus Totalus.

1251
01:55:33.307 --> 01:55:34.394
Well done, Neville.

1252
01:55:43.219 --> 01:55:43.719
Stupefy.

1253
01:55:46.456 --> 01:55:47.814
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

1254
01:55:58.985 --> 01:55:59.253
Stupefy.

1255
01:56:08.305 --> 01:56:08.909
Reducto.

1256
01:56:26.703 --> 01:56:27.614
Get back to the door.

1257
01:57:04.437 --> 01:57:07.610
Department of Mysteries. They
got that bit right, didn't they?

1258
01:57:14.049 --> 01:57:14.501
The voices.

1259
01:57:16.299 --> 01:57:17.424
Can you tell what they're saying?

1260
01:57:19.881 --> 01:57:21.253
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1261
01:57:22.954 --> 01:57:23.766
Let's get out of here.

1262
01:57:24.912 --> 01:57:25.766
I hear them too.

1263
01:57:29.737 --> 01:57:31.798
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1264
01:57:34.767 --> 01:57:35.348
Please, Harry.

1265
01:57:37.233 --> 01:57:37.829
Get behind me.

1266
01:58:25.674 --> 01:58:27.296
Did you actually believe...

1267
01:58:28.547 --> 01:58:31.725
...or were you truly naive enough to think...

1268
01:58:33.443 --> 01:58:38.422
...that children stood a chance against us?

1269
01:58:42.330 --> 01:58:45.942
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1270
01:58:49.265 --> 01:58:51.962
Give me the prophecy now...

1271
01:58:53.141 --> 01:58:56.799
...or watch your friends die.

1272
01:59:09.974 --> 01:59:11.099
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1273
01:59:37.885 --> 01:59:39.497
Get away from my godson.

1274
02:00:10.584 --> 02:00:13.287
Now, listen to me. Take the
others and get out of here.

1275
02:00:13.788 --> 02:00:15.409
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1276
02:00:15.648 --> 02:00:17.151
You've done beautifully.

1277
02:00:19.332 --> 02:00:20.442
Now, let me take it from here.

1278
02:00:21.223 --> 02:00:21.556
Black.

1279
02:00:48.858 --> 02:00:49.598
Expelliarmus!

1280
02:00:50.286 --> 02:00:51.377
Nice one, James.

1281
02:00:59.160 --> 02:00:59.712
Avada Kedavra.

1282
02:01:20.738 --> 02:01:22.457
No. No.

1283
02:01:47.441 --> 02:01:49.085
I killed Sirius Black.

1284
02:01:51.007 --> 02:01:52.255
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.

1285
02:02:05.465 --> 02:02:07.036
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1286
02:02:08.443 --> 02:02:11.941
She killed him. She deserves it.

1287
02:02:16.087 --> 02:02:18.035
You know the spell, Harry.

1288
02:02:30.930 --> 02:02:31.132
Do it.

1289
02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:41.913
So weak.

1290
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:52.184
It was foolish of you to
come here tonight, Tom.

1291
02:02:53.276 --> 02:02:54.754
The Aurors are on their way.

1292
02:02:55.348 --> 02:02:57.994
By which time I shall be gone, and you...

1293
02:03:00.834 --> 02:03:01.523
...shall be dead.

1294
02:05:16.238 --> 02:05:18.361
You've lost, old man.

1295
02:05:39.288 --> 02:05:39.586
Harry.

1296
02:05:44.487 --> 02:05:44.926
So weak.

1297
02:05:46.477 --> 02:05:48.070
So vulnerable.

1298
02:05:53.271 --> 02:05:53.737
Look at me.

1299
02:05:56.830 --> 02:05:59.817
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1300
02:06:01.010 --> 02:06:02.143
It's how you are not.

1301
02:06:08.361 --> 02:06:08.648
Harry?

1302
02:06:42.259 --> 02:06:43.334
You're the weak one...

1303
02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:47.611
...and you'll never know love or friendship.

1304
02:06:51.707 --> 02:06:53.536
And I feel sorry for you.

1305
02:07:18.143 --> 02:07:20.102
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1306
02:07:22.269 --> 02:07:26.146
And you will lose everything.

1307
02:07:42.128 --> 02:07:42.490
He's back.

1308
02:08:38.786 --> 02:08:39.730
Feast about to start.

1309
02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:42.304
Thanks Ron.
But I'm not really in the mood.

1310
02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:46.835
You know...
I'm not hungry either.

1311
02:08:47.758 --> 02:08:51.590
You go on...
Really I'll be okay.

1312
02:09:53.456 --> 02:09:54.706
Harry

1313
02:09:56.626 --> 02:09:57.284
Come in.

1314
02:10:00.325 --> 02:10:01.236
Come on.

1315
02:10:02.362 --> 02:10:03.034
I know how you feel, Harry.

1316
02:10:03.881 --> 02:10:04.414
No, you don't.

1317
02:10:11.142 --> 02:10:11.782
It's my fault.

1318
02:10:12.765 --> 02:10:14.690
No, the fault is mine.

1319
02:10:16.954 --> 02:10:18.456
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1320
02:10:18.861 --> 02:10:20.954
...before Voldemort made
the connection between you.

1321
02:10:22.516 --> 02:10:27.002
I thought by distancing myself
from you, as I have done all year...

1322
02:10:27.313 --> 02:10:31.540
...he'd be less tempted, and
therefore you might be more protected.

1323
02:10:35.223 --> 02:10:37.205
The prophecy said:

1324
02:10:39.125 --> 02:10:41.972
"Neither one can live while
the other one survives."

1325
02:10:44.445 --> 02:10:49.289
It means one of us is gonna have
to kill the other, in the end.

1326
02:10:52.138 --> 02:10:52.688
Yes.

1327
02:10:54.433 --> 02:10:55.418
Why didn't you tell me?

1328
02:10:56.434 --> 02:10:58.592
For the same reason you tried to save Sirius.

1329
02:10:59.948 --> 02:11:01.763
The same reason your friends saved you.

1330
02:11:03.387 --> 02:11:05.719
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1331
02:11:07.093 --> 02:11:08.763
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.

1332
02:11:11.261 --> 02:11:12.638
I cared too much about you.

1333
02:11:38.271 --> 02:11:39.647
How come you're not at the feast?

1334
02:11:40.828 --> 02:11:44.760
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.

1335
02:11:45.742 --> 02:11:46.052
That's awful.

1336
02:11:46.834 --> 02:11:47.896
Oh, it's all good fun.

1337
02:11:48.928 --> 02:11:51.271
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1338
02:11:52.416 --> 02:11:53.908
Do you want any help finding them?

1339
02:11:57.507 --> 02:11:59.770
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1340
02:12:07.989 --> 02:12:09.480
Are you sure you don't want any help looking?

1341
02:12:10.019 --> 02:12:10.905
That's all right.

1342
02:12:12.210 --> 02:12:14.115
Anyway, my mum always said...

1343
02:12:14.573 --> 02:12:17.116
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1344
02:12:21.647 --> 02:12:23.444
If not always in the way we expect.

1345
02:12:26.426 --> 02:12:27.697
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1346
02:13:04.742 --> 02:13:06.647
I've been thinking about
something Dumbledore said to me.

1347
02:13:07.741 --> 02:13:08.212
What's that?

1348
02:13:09.888 --> 02:13:11.838
That even though we've
got a fight ahead of us...

1349
02:13:13.041 --> 02:13:14.927
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1350
02:13:16.207 --> 02:13:17.457
Yeah?

1351
02:13:19.696 --> 02:13:20.761
Something worth fighting for.
