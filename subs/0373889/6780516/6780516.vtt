00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.570
<font color="#707070">I don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn't it?</font>

2
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.570
<font color="#707070">And it's going to get even worse. Temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius....</font>

3
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.570
<font color="#707070">....that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.</font>

4
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.570
<font color="#707070">So, please, remember to cover up and stay cool....</font>

5
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.570
<font color="#707070">....with the hottest hits on your FM dial.</font>

6
00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:13.998
<font color="#707070">Come on, guys, time to go home.</font>

7
00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:16.876
<font color="#707070">Come on, love, off you get.</font>

8
00:01:18.836 --> 00:01:22.256
<font color="#707070">~ Do we have to?
~ Yes, we do.</font>

9
00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.802
<font color="#707070">I'll make you your favorite dinner to compensate.</font>

10
00:01:27.178 --> 00:01:28.846
<font color="#707070">He squealed like a pig, didn't he?</font>

11
00:01:29.013 --> 00:01:32.558
<font color="#707070">Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D. Did you see his face?</font>

12
00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.560
<font color="#707070">Hey, Big D.</font>

13
00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:37.063
<font color="#707070">Beat up another 10-year-old?</font>

14
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.732
<font color="#707070">~ This one deserved it.
~ Yeah.</font>

15
00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:44.570
<font color="#707070">~ Five against one, very brave.
~ Well, you're one to talk.</font>

16
00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:49.992
<font color="#707070">Moaning in your sleep every night? At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.</font>

17
00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:54.997
<font color="#707070">"Don't kill Cedric."</font>

18
00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:57.083
<font color="#707070">Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?</font>

19
00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:02.421
<font color="#707070">~ Shut up.
~ "He's going to kill me, Mum."</font>

20
00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:05.091
<font color="#707070">Where is your mum?</font>

21
00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.553
<font color="#707070">Where is your mum, Potter?</font>

22
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:10.763
<font color="#707070">She dead?</font>

23
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.599
<font color="#707070">Is she dead?</font>

24
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.434
<font color="#707070">Is she a dead Pott....?</font>

25
00:02:29.657 --> 00:02:31.450
<font color="#707070">~ Dudley.
~ Dudley, let's go.</font>

26
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.205
<font color="#707070">~ What's going on?
~ What are you doing?</font>

27
00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:39.333
<font color="#707070">~ I'm not doing anything.
~ We're getting out of here, Dudley.</font>

28
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.043
<font color="#707070">Come on, Dudley, hurry up.</font>

29
00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:33.347
<font color="#707070">Dudley, run.</font>

30
00:04:09.007 --> 00:04:10.384
<font color="#707070">Expecto Patronum.</font>

31
00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:42.040
<font color="#707070">Mrs. Figg.</font>

32
00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.005
<font color="#707070">Don't put away your wand, Harry.</font>

33
00:04:48.297 --> 00:04:50.674
<font color="#707070">They might come back.</font>

34
00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:54.928
<font color="#707070">Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?</font>

35
00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:59.057
<font color="#707070">~ Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
~ I don't understand. How do you know....?</font>

36
00:04:59.224 --> 00:05:01.435
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.</font>

37
00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:04.980
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?</font>

38
00:05:05.147 --> 00:05:08.984
<font color="#707070">After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year....</font>

39
00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:11.820
<font color="#707070">....did you expect him to let you go wandering on your own?</font>

40
00:05:11.987 --> 00:05:14.656
<font color="#707070">Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.</font>

41
00:05:14.823 --> 00:05:17.951
<font color="#707070">Now, get inside and stay there.</font>

42
00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:22.790
<font color="#707070">Expect someone will be in touch soon. Whatever happens, don't leave the house.</font>

43
00:05:32.216 --> 00:05:34.593
<font color="#707070">It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.</font>

44
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.887
<font color="#707070">There's sweat. There's stifling.</font>

45
00:05:37.054 --> 00:05:38.972
<font color="#707070">Diddykins?</font>

46
00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:41.308
<font color="#707070">Is that you?</font>

47
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.648
<font color="#707070">Duddy. Vernon, come quick.</font>

48
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.859
<font color="#707070">We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.</font>

49
00:05:51.026 --> 00:05:53.153
<font color="#707070">Who did this to you, boy?</font>

50
00:05:57.574 --> 00:05:59.326
<font color="#707070">Happy, are we, now?</font>

51
00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:03.330
<font color="#707070">You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.</font>

52
00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:06.333
<font color="#707070">Vernon, don't say that.</font>

53
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.838
<font color="#707070">Well, just look at him, Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.</font>

54
00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:13.173
<font color="#707070">I've reached my limit, do you hear?</font>

55
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.177
<font color="#707070">This is the last I'm gonna take of you and your nonsense.</font>

56
00:06:31.108 --> 00:06:33.193
<font color="#707070">~ Dear Mr. Potter.
~ What?</font>

57
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.615
<font color="#707070">The Ministry has received intelligence that at 6:23 this evening....</font>

58
00:06:38.782 --> 00:06:43.537
<font color="#707070">....you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle.</font>

59
00:06:43.745 --> 00:06:45.789
<font color="#707070">As a clear violation....</font>

60
00:06:45.956 --> 00:06:50.043
<font color="#707070">....of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery....</font>

61
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.337
<font color="#707070">....you are hereby expelled....</font>

62
00:06:52.754 --> 00:06:56.216
<font color="#707070">....from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</font>

63
00:06:56.925 --> 00:07:01.346
<font color="#707070">Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.</font>

64
00:07:05.476 --> 00:07:07.811
<font color="#707070">Justice.</font>

65
00:07:20.073 --> 00:07:22.242
<font color="#707070">He's not very well.</font>

66
00:07:34.797 --> 00:07:36.590
<font color="#707070">Sorry, Hedwig.</font>

67
00:08:43.783 --> 00:08:45.577
<font color="#707070">Very clean, these Muggles.</font>

68
00:08:45.952 --> 00:08:48.830
<font color="#707070">~ Tonks, for God's sake.
~ Unnatural.</font>

69
00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:54.335
<font color="#707070">Professor Moody.</font>

70
00:08:54.794 --> 00:08:57.839
<font color="#707070">~ What are you doing here?
~ Rescuing you, of course.</font>

71
00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:03.428
<font color="#707070">But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.</font>

72
00:09:03.595 --> 00:09:06.014
<font color="#707070">You haven't been. Not yet. Kingsley, you take point.</font>

73
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:07.223
<font color="#707070">But the letter said....</font>

74
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.393
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore persuaded the minister to suspend your expulsion....</font>

75
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.729
<font color="#707070">....pending a formal hearing.
~ A hearing?</font>

76
00:09:12.896 --> 00:09:16.274
<font color="#707070">Don't worry. We'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters.</font>

77
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:18.735
<font color="#707070">Not here, Nymphadora.</font>

78
00:09:18.902 --> 00:09:22.739
<font color="#707070">Don't call me Nymphadora.</font>

79
00:09:28.077 --> 00:09:32.207
<font color="#707070">Stay in formation, everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.</font>

80
00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:24.050
<font color="#707070">Come on, you, around the corner.</font>

81
00:10:26.094 --> 00:10:27.554
<font color="#707070">Come on.</font>

82
00:11:06.968 --> 00:11:08.761
<font color="#707070">In you go, son.</font>

83
00:11:10.305 --> 00:11:11.806
<font color="#707070">There've been no sightings.</font>

84
00:11:11.973 --> 00:11:13.683
<font color="#707070">No deaths. No proof.</font>

85
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.728
<font color="#707070">He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough....</font>

86
00:11:16.895 --> 00:11:20.815
<font color="#707070">Yes, but guarding you-know-what is the most important....</font>

87
00:11:23.109 --> 00:11:25.528
<font color="#707070">We must trust Dumbledore on this.</font>

88
00:11:25.695 --> 00:11:30.116
<font color="#707070">Was he able to protect Harry last year? Tonight I say it's time to take action.</font>

89
00:11:30.283 --> 00:11:33.495
<font color="#707070">Cornelius Fudge is a politician first and a wizard second.</font>

90
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:36.831
<font color="#707070">~ His instinct would be to ignore it....
~ Keep your voices down.</font>

91
00:11:36.998 --> 00:11:41.419
<font color="#707070">He's getting stronger and stronger by the minute. We have to act now.</font>

92
00:11:45.381 --> 00:11:47.675
<font color="#707070">~ Harry.
~ Mrs. Weasley.</font>

93
00:11:50.345 --> 00:11:52.847
<font color="#707070">Heavens, you're all right.</font>

94
00:11:56.351 --> 00:12:00.063
<font color="#707070">Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait until after the meeting's finished.</font>

95
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.360
<font color="#707070">Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.</font>

96
00:12:05.735 --> 00:12:07.195
<font color="#707070">Yeah.</font>

97
00:12:09.447 --> 00:12:14.661
<font color="#707070">Mudblood, werewolves,
traitors, thieves.</font>

98
00:12:14.828 --> 00:12:19.707
<font color="#707070">If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house....</font>

99
00:12:19.874 --> 00:12:22.168
<font color="#707070">....what would she say to old Kreacher?</font>

100
00:12:23.211 --> 00:12:26.214
<font color="#707070">Oh, the shame.</font>

101
00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:41.312
<font color="#707070">~ Freaks.
~ There, there, mistress.</font>

102
00:12:41.521 --> 00:12:44.899
<font color="#707070">Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.</font>

103
00:12:45.066 --> 00:12:47.694
<font color="#707070">Kreacher is here.</font>

104
00:12:51.739 --> 00:12:53.199
<font color="#707070">Oh, Harry.</font>

105
00:12:55.994 --> 00:12:59.831
<font color="#707070">Are you all right? We overheard them talking about the Dementor attack.</font>

106
00:12:59.998 --> 00:13:02.834
<font color="#707070">~ You must tell us everything.
~ Let the man breathe, Hermione.</font>

107
00:13:03.001 --> 00:13:07.213
<font color="#707070">And this hearing at the Ministry. It's just outrageous.</font>

108
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.549
<font color="#707070">I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.</font>

109
00:13:09.716 --> 00:13:12.427
<font color="#707070">~ It's completely unfair.
~ Yeah.</font>

110
00:13:12.927 --> 00:13:15.555
<font color="#707070">There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.</font>

111
00:13:17.432 --> 00:13:19.392
<font color="#707070">So, what is this place?</font>

112
00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:22.270
<font color="#707070">~ It's headquarters.
~ Of the Order of the Phoenix.</font>

113
00:13:23.062 --> 00:13:24.564
<font color="#707070">It's a secret society.</font>

114
00:13:24.731 --> 00:13:27.275
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore formed it back when they fought You-Know-Who.</font>

115
00:13:27.442 --> 00:13:30.028
<font color="#707070">Couldn't have put any of this in a letter, I suppose?</font>

116
00:13:30.695 --> 00:13:32.906
<font color="#707070">I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.</font>

117
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:37.119
<font color="#707070">We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.</font>

118
00:13:37.286 --> 00:13:38.329
<font color="#707070">~ Only....
~ Only what?</font>

119
00:13:38.496 --> 00:13:41.707
<font color="#707070">Only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything.</font>

120
00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:45.211
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore said that?</font>

121
00:13:47.004 --> 00:13:49.757
<font color="#707070">But why would he keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help.</font>

122
00:13:49.924 --> 00:13:51.884
<font color="#707070">I'm the one
who saw Voldemort return....</font>

123
00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:54.887
<font color="#707070">....the one who fought him, who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.</font>

124
00:13:55.054 --> 00:13:57.264
<font color="#707070">~ Harry.
~ Thought we heard your dulcet tones.</font>

125
00:13:57.431 --> 00:14:01.477
<font color="#707070">~ Don't bottle it up, though. Let it out.
~ If you're all done shouting....</font>

126
00:14:01.644 --> 00:14:04.146
<font color="#707070">Do you wanna hear something a little more interesting?</font>

127
00:14:05.481 --> 00:14:08.818
<font color="#707070">If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for Harry....</font>

128
00:14:08.984 --> 00:14:11.028
<font color="#707070">....we wouldn't even know
Voldemort was back.</font>

129
00:14:11.195 --> 00:14:12.780
<font color="#707070">He's not a child, Molly.</font>

130
00:14:12.947 --> 00:14:15.324
<font color="#707070">But he's not an adult either.</font>

131
00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:18.536
<font color="#707070">~ He's not James, Sirius.
~ Well, he's not your son.</font>

132
00:14:18.702 --> 00:14:20.871
<font color="#707070">He's as good as.</font>

133
00:14:21.247 --> 00:14:22.957
<font color="#707070">~ Who else has he got?
~ Hey, Ginny.</font>

134
00:14:23.124 --> 00:14:25.543
<font color="#707070">~ He's got me.
~ How touchingly paternal, Black.</font>

135
00:14:25.709 --> 00:14:28.838
<font color="#707070">Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather.</font>

136
00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:30.756
<font color="#707070">Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.</font>

137
00:14:30.923 --> 00:14:33.008
<font color="#707070">~ Snape's part of the Order?
~ Git.</font>

138
00:14:33.175 --> 00:14:35.010
<font color="#707070">About your supposed reformation.</font>

139
00:14:35.177 --> 00:14:37.930
<font color="#707070">~ I know better.
~ So why don't you tell him?</font>

140
00:14:38.097 --> 00:14:39.807
<font color="#707070">~ Get off it.
~ Quick.</font>

141
00:14:39.974 --> 00:14:41.600
<font color="#707070">~ Get it up.
~ Crookshanks.</font>

142
00:14:42.017 --> 00:14:44.186
<font color="#707070">~ Stop it.
~ Get off, you bloody cat.</font>

143
00:14:44.353 --> 00:14:46.605
<font color="#707070">~ Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
~ Get it up.</font>

144
00:14:48.566 --> 00:14:52.236
<font color="#707070">~ Hermione, I hate your cat.
~ Bad Crookshanks.</font>

145
00:14:53.487 --> 00:14:56.157
<font color="#707070">Well, we'll be eating
down in the kitchen.</font>

146
00:14:57.074 --> 00:14:59.410
<font color="#707070">Just because you're allowed to use magic now....</font>

147
00:14:59.577 --> 00:15:02.621
<font color="#707070">....does not mean you have to whip your wands out for everything.</font>

148
00:15:02.788 --> 00:15:04.373
<font color="#707070">Hi, Mum.</font>

149
00:15:05.374 --> 00:15:07.084
<font color="#707070">You hungry, Harry?</font>

150
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:09.879
<font color="#707070">You sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us quite a turn.</font>

151
00:15:10.045 --> 00:15:12.214
<font color="#707070">Harry Potter.</font>

152
00:15:14.425 --> 00:15:16.218
<font color="#707070">Sirius.</font>

153
00:15:21.974 --> 00:15:24.226
<font color="#707070">This is very, very peculiar.</font>

154
00:15:24.393 --> 00:15:28.063
<font color="#707070">It seems your hearing in the Ministry is to be before the entire Wizengamot.</font>

155
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.692
<font color="#707070">I don't understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me?</font>

156
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.030
<font color="#707070">Show him. He'll find out soon enough.</font>

157
00:15:46.415 --> 00:15:49.418
<font color="#707070">He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.</font>

158
00:15:51.253 --> 00:15:56.258
<font color="#707070">Fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet....</font>

159
00:15:56.592 --> 00:15:59.595
<font color="#707070">....to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned.</font>

160
00:15:59.762 --> 00:16:01.055
<font color="#707070">Why?</font>

161
00:16:01.222 --> 00:16:03.182
<font color="#707070">He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.</font>

162
00:16:03.349 --> 00:16:05.476
<font color="#707070">No one in their right mind could believe that....</font>

163
00:16:05.643 --> 00:16:08.521
<font color="#707070">Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.</font>

164
00:16:08.687 --> 00:16:11.232
<font color="#707070">It's been twisted and warped by fear.</font>

165
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.319
<font color="#707070">Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.</font>

166
00:16:15.486 --> 00:16:17.947
<font color="#707070">The last time
Voldemort gained power....</font>

167
00:16:18.113 --> 00:16:21.450
<font color="#707070">....he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.</font>

168
00:16:21.617 --> 00:16:25.538
<font color="#707070">Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the minister will do almost anything....</font>

169
00:16:25.704 --> 00:16:28.624
<font color="#707070">....to avoid facing that terrifying truth.</font>

170
00:16:29.917 --> 00:16:34.588
<font color="#707070">We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.</font>

171
00:16:35.714 --> 00:16:38.384
<font color="#707070">Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.</font>

172
00:16:38.551 --> 00:16:43.139
<font color="#707070">And not just witches and wizards, but all manner of dark creatures.</font>

173
00:16:43.722 --> 00:16:47.768
<font color="#707070">He's been recruiting heavily, and we've been attempting to do the same.</font>

174
00:16:48.686 --> 00:16:52.481
<font color="#707070">But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.</font>

175
00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:57.236
<font color="#707070">We believe....</font>

176
00:16:58.195 --> 00:17:00.156
<font color="#707070">....Voldemort may be after something.</font>

177
00:17:00.322 --> 00:17:01.448
<font color="#707070">Sirius.</font>

178
00:17:05.077 --> 00:17:07.955
<font color="#707070">Something he didn't have last time.</font>

179
00:17:09.415 --> 00:17:11.459
<font color="#707070">You mean like a weapon?</font>

180
00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:15.671
<font color="#707070">No. That's enough. He's just a boy.</font>

181
00:17:15.838 --> 00:17:18.674
<font color="#707070">You say more and you might as well induct him into the Order.</font>

182
00:17:18.841 --> 00:17:22.636
<font color="#707070">Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight.</font>

183
00:17:35.107 --> 00:17:36.984
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

184
00:17:37.151 --> 00:17:39.403
<font color="#707070">You are hereby expelled.</font>

185
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.364
<font color="#707070">Before the entire Wizengamot.</font>

186
00:17:51.707 --> 00:17:53.501
<font color="#707070">Trains. Underground.</font>

187
00:17:53.667 --> 00:17:55.961
<font color="#707070">Ingenious, these Muggles.</font>

188
00:18:13.145 --> 00:18:14.980
<font color="#707070">Here we are.</font>

189
00:18:16.774 --> 00:18:21.237
<font color="#707070">I've never used the visitors' entrance before. Should be fun.</font>

190
00:18:21.946 --> 00:18:26.283
<font color="#707070">Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.</font>

191
00:19:06.283 --> 00:19:09.202
<font color="#707070">Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons trading on the potions market.</font>

192
00:19:09.369 --> 00:19:12.664
<font color="#707070">Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?</font>

193
00:19:12.831 --> 00:19:15.834
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?</font>

194
00:19:37.814 --> 00:19:40.609
<font color="#707070">~ Morning, Arthur.
~ Morning, Bob.</font>

195
00:19:43.236 --> 00:19:44.821
<font color="#707070">Interdepartmental memos.</font>

196
00:19:44.988 --> 00:19:48.950
<font color="#707070">We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.</font>

197
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.501
<font color="#707070">Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.</font>

198
00:19:57.667 --> 00:19:59.503
<font color="#707070">They've changed the time
of your hearing.</font>

199
00:19:59.669 --> 00:20:01.046
<font color="#707070">When is it?</font>

200
00:20:01.463 --> 00:20:03.340
<font color="#707070">In five minutes.</font>

201
00:20:11.014 --> 00:20:14.226
<font color="#707070">Department of Mysteries.</font>

202
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.899
<font color="#707070">And I'm confident, minister, that you will do the right thing.</font>

203
00:20:21.066 --> 00:20:23.193
<font color="#707070">Yes, but we must be....</font>

204
00:20:30.325 --> 00:20:33.745
<font color="#707070">Remember, during the hearing, speak only when you're spoken to.</font>

205
00:20:33.912 --> 00:20:37.457
<font color="#707070">Keep calm.
You've done nothing wrong.</font>

206
00:20:37.749 --> 00:20:41.044
<font color="#707070">As the Muggles say, truth will out.</font>

207
00:20:41.545 --> 00:20:42.879
<font color="#707070">Yes?</font>

208
00:20:44.047 --> 00:20:46.383
<font color="#707070">I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.</font>

209
00:20:48.009 --> 00:20:49.761
<font color="#707070">Good luck, Harry.</font>

210
00:20:53.723 --> 00:20:56.226
<font color="#707070">Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August....</font>

211
00:20:56.393 --> 00:20:59.354
<font color="#707070">....into offenses committed by Harry James Potter...</font>

212
00:20:59.521 --> 00:21:03.150
<font color="#707070">....resident at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.</font>

213
00:21:03.316 --> 00:21:06.403
<font color="#707070">Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag....</font>

214
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.405
<font color="#707070">Witness for the defense.</font>

215
00:21:08.572 --> 00:21:11.741
<font color="#707070">Albus Percival Wulfric....</font>

216
00:21:12.075 --> 00:21:15.495
<font color="#707070">....Brian Dumbledore.</font>

217
00:21:15.787 --> 00:21:19.082
<font color="#707070">You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing....</font>

218
00:21:19.249 --> 00:21:21.793
<font color="#707070">....had been changed, did you?
~ I must have missed it.</font>

219
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.922
<font color="#707070">But by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.</font>

220
00:21:28.884 --> 00:21:30.093
<font color="#707070">The charges?</font>

221
00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.762
<font color="#707070">The charges against the accused are as follows:</font>

222
00:21:32.929 --> 00:21:34.598
<font color="#707070">"That he did knowingly....</font>

223
00:21:34.764 --> 00:21:38.310
<font color="#707070">....and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions....</font>

224
00:21:38.477 --> 00:21:41.480
<font color="#707070">....produce a Patronus Charm....</font>

225
00:21:41.646 --> 00:21:44.900
<font color="#707070">....in the presence of a Muggle."</font>

226
00:21:45.066 --> 00:21:48.361
<font color="#707070">~ Do you deny producing said Patronus?
~ No, but....</font>

227
00:21:48.528 --> 00:21:51.990
<font color="#707070">And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school....</font>

228
00:21:52.157 --> 00:21:55.035
<font color="#707070">....while under the age of 17?
~ Yes, I was, but....</font>

229
00:21:55.202 --> 00:21:58.580
<font color="#707070">Witches and wizards
of the Wizengamot....</font>

230
00:21:58.747 --> 00:22:00.957
<font color="#707070">I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.</font>

231
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.337
<font color="#707070">Dementors?</font>

232
00:22:05.962 --> 00:22:07.631
<font color="#707070">In Little Whinging?</font>

233
00:22:07.798 --> 00:22:10.133
<font color="#707070">That's quite clever.</font>

234
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.470
<font color="#707070">Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?</font>

235
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.847
<font color="#707070">~ Highly convenient.
~ I'm not lying.</font>

236
00:22:16.014 --> 00:22:18.600
<font color="#707070">~ There were two of them, if I hadn't....
~ Enough.</font>

237
00:22:18.767 --> 00:22:22.979
<font color="#707070">I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would be a very well-rehearsed story....</font>

238
00:22:23.146 --> 00:22:27.651
<font color="#707070">....but since you can produce no witnesses of the event....</font>

239
00:22:27.818 --> 00:22:32.405
<font color="#707070">Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.</font>

240
00:22:35.742 --> 00:22:38.829
<font color="#707070">Please describe the attack.</font>

241
00:22:41.623 --> 00:22:43.416
<font color="#707070">What did they look like?</font>

242
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.422
<font color="#707070">Well, one of them was very large and the other rather skinny.</font>

243
00:22:50.507 --> 00:22:53.343
<font color="#707070">Not the boys. The Dementors.</font>

244
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:57.180
<font color="#707070">Oh, right, right. Well, big.</font>

245
00:22:58.348 --> 00:23:02.978
<font color="#707070">Cloaked. Then everything went cold....</font>

246
00:23:03.603 --> 00:23:07.023
<font color="#707070">....as though all the happiness had gone from the world.</font>

247
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:12.279
<font color="#707070">Now, look here. Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb....</font>

248
00:23:12.445 --> 00:23:16.074
<font color="#707070">....and happen across a wizard. The odds are astronomical.</font>

249
00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:17.993
<font color="#707070">I don't think anyone would believe....</font>

250
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.204
<font color="#707070">....the Dementors were there by coincidence, minister.</font>

251
00:23:23.707 --> 00:23:26.585
<font color="#707070">I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, professor.</font>

252
00:23:26.751 --> 00:23:32.257
<font color="#707070">Dementors are, after all, under the control of the Ministry of Magic.</font>

253
00:23:32.424 --> 00:23:36.636
<font color="#707070">And it's so silly of me, but it sounded for a moment as though....</font>

254
00:23:36.803 --> 00:23:40.807
<font color="#707070">....you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy.</font>

255
00:23:40.974 --> 00:23:43.768
<font color="#707070">That would be disturbing indeed, Madam Undersecretary....</font>

256
00:23:43.935 --> 00:23:48.107
<font color="#707070">....which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry....</font>

257
00:23:48.274 --> 00:23:51.652
<font color="#707070">....into why the two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban....</font>

258
00:23:51.819 --> 00:23:55.198
<font color="#707070">....and why they mounted an attack without authorization.</font>

259
00:23:56.073 --> 00:23:58.284
<font color="#707070">Of course, there is someone....</font>

260
00:23:58.618 --> 00:24:01.245
<font color="#707070">....who might be behind the attack.</font>

261
00:24:04.248 --> 00:24:08.878
<font color="#707070">Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.</font>

262
00:24:09.045 --> 00:24:13.591
<font color="#707070">The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontrovertible.</font>

263
00:24:13.758 --> 00:24:16.552
<font color="#707070">He is not back.</font>

264
00:24:22.433 --> 00:24:24.644
<font color="#707070">In the matter of Harry Potter....</font>

265
00:24:25.228 --> 00:24:27.647
<font color="#707070">....the law clearly states....</font>

266
00:24:27.897 --> 00:24:32.276
<font color="#707070">....that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations.</font>

267
00:24:32.443 --> 00:24:35.363
<font color="#707070">Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.</font>

268
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.699
<font color="#707070">Clearly. Has it become practice to hold a full criminal trial....</font>

269
00:24:38.866 --> 00:24:41.744
<font color="#707070">....to deal with a simple matter of underage magic?</font>

270
00:24:50.128 --> 00:24:53.714
<font color="#707070">Those in favor of conviction?</font>

271
00:25:02.515 --> 00:25:07.478
<font color="#707070">Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?</font>

272
00:25:21.576 --> 00:25:23.828
<font color="#707070">Cleared of all charges.</font>

273
00:25:26.873 --> 00:25:28.624
<font color="#707070">Professor.</font>

274
00:25:41.554 --> 00:25:44.640
<font color="#707070">Padfoot. Are you barking mad?</font>

275
00:25:44.807 --> 00:25:47.185
<font color="#707070">You'll blow the entire operation.</font>

276
00:25:55.568 --> 00:25:58.196
<font color="#707070">Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you....</font>

277
00:25:58.362 --> 00:26:00.990
<font color="#707070">I had to see you off, didn't I?</font>

278
00:26:02.784 --> 00:26:05.286
<font color="#707070">What's life without a little risk?</font>

279
00:26:05.495 --> 00:26:07.830
<font color="#707070">I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.</font>

280
00:26:07.997 --> 00:26:09.457
<font color="#707070">Don't worry about me.</font>

281
00:26:09.874 --> 00:26:14.879
<font color="#707070">Anyway, I wanted you to have this.</font>

282
00:26:20.259 --> 00:26:23.304
<font color="#707070">Original Order of the Phoenix.</font>

283
00:26:23.846 --> 00:26:25.556
<font color="#707070">Marlene McKinnon.</font>

284
00:26:25.723 --> 00:26:28.309
<font color="#707070">She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.</font>

285
00:26:28.684 --> 00:26:31.854
<font color="#707070">Voldemort wiped out her entire family.</font>

286
00:26:32.271 --> 00:26:34.065
<font color="#707070">Frank and Alice Longbottom.</font>

287
00:26:34.232 --> 00:26:35.733
<font color="#707070">Neville's parents.</font>

288
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.570
<font color="#707070">They suffered a fate worse than death, you ask me.</font>

289
00:26:41.531 --> 00:26:43.991
<font color="#707070">It's been 14 years.</font>

290
00:26:44.826 --> 00:26:49.038
<font color="#707070">And still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad.</font>

291
00:26:53.709 --> 00:26:56.379
<font color="#707070">Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?</font>

292
00:26:59.048 --> 00:27:02.093
<font color="#707070">It feels like it did before.</font>

293
00:27:06.305 --> 00:27:08.099
<font color="#707070">You keep it.</font>

294
00:27:08.599 --> 00:27:12.979
<font color="#707070">Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.</font>

295
00:27:15.189 --> 00:27:17.024
<font color="#707070">I'll see you at the train.</font>

296
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:19.235
<font color="#707070">Bye-bye, darling.</font>

297
00:27:20.111 --> 00:27:21.612
<font color="#707070">I love you.</font>

298
00:27:22.363 --> 00:27:24.365
<font color="#707070">Hold my hand, lovey.</font>

299
00:27:24.615 --> 00:27:26.909
<font color="#707070">There they are.
They're in the far carriage.</font>

300
00:27:27.076 --> 00:27:28.369
<font color="#707070">Bye.</font>

301
00:28:10.578 --> 00:28:13.498
<font color="#707070">I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free.</font>

302
00:28:13.664 --> 00:28:15.166
<font color="#707070">Better enjoy it while you can.</font>

303
00:28:15.333 --> 00:28:18.628
<font color="#707070">I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it.</font>

304
00:28:21.214 --> 00:28:25.176
<font color="#707070">~ What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
~ Just stay away from me!</font>

305
00:28:26.385 --> 00:28:28.221
<font color="#707070">It's only Malfoy.</font>

306
00:28:29.055 --> 00:28:30.890
<font color="#707070">What'd you expect?</font>

307
00:28:50.869 --> 00:28:52.037
<font color="#707070">Hi, guys.</font>

308
00:28:52.204 --> 00:28:53.872
<font color="#707070">~ Hey, Neville.
~ Hey there, Neville.</font>

309
00:29:06.927 --> 00:29:08.470
<font color="#707070">What is it?</font>

310
00:29:10.639 --> 00:29:13.892
<font color="#707070">~ What's what?
~ That. Pulling the carriage.</font>

311
00:29:14.726 --> 00:29:17.062
<font color="#707070">Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.</font>

312
00:29:17.688 --> 00:29:19.898
<font color="#707070">It's pulling itself, like always.</font>

313
00:29:33.537 --> 00:29:35.747
<font color="#707070">You're not going mad.</font>

314
00:29:38.333 --> 00:29:40.586
<font color="#707070">I can see them too.</font>

315
00:29:41.837 --> 00:29:44.423
<font color="#707070">You're just as sane as I am.</font>

316
00:29:49.261 --> 00:29:51.305
<font color="#707070">Everyone, this is Loony Love....</font>

317
00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:56.018
<font color="#707070">Luna Lovegood.</font>

318
00:29:59.938 --> 00:30:02.274
<font color="#707070">What an interesting necklace.</font>

319
00:30:02.816 --> 00:30:04.985
<font color="#707070">It's a charm, actually.</font>

320
00:30:06.361 --> 00:30:07.946
<font color="#707070">Keeps away the Nargles.</font>

321
00:30:11.742 --> 00:30:13.243
<font color="#707070">Hungry.</font>

322
00:30:13.911 --> 00:30:15.871
<font color="#707070">I hope there's pudding.</font>

323
00:30:16.872 --> 00:30:20.459
<font color="#707070">~ What's a Nargle?
~ No idea.</font>

324
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.807
<font color="#707070">Good evening, children.</font>

325
00:30:36.099 --> 00:30:38.811
<font color="#707070">Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.</font>

326
00:30:38.977 --> 00:30:42.022
<font color="#707070">We're pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank....</font>

327
00:30:42.189 --> 00:30:44.775
<font color="#707070">....who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures....</font>

328
00:30:44.942 --> 00:30:48.403
<font color="#707070">....while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave.</font>

329
00:30:49.238 --> 00:30:53.242
<font color="#707070">We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher....</font>

330
00:30:53.408 --> 00:30:56.578
<font color="#707070">....Professor Dolores Umbridge.</font>

331
00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:00.624
<font color="#707070">And I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing the professor good luck.</font>

332
00:31:01.416 --> 00:31:06.421
<font color="#707070">Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you....</font>

333
00:31:17.516 --> 00:31:20.227
<font color="#707070">She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.</font>

334
00:31:20.394 --> 00:31:26.108
<font color="#707070">Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.</font>

335
00:31:27.484 --> 00:31:31.155
<font color="#707070">And how lovely to see all your bright....</font>

336
00:31:31.321 --> 00:31:34.158
<font color="#707070">....happy faces smiling up at me.</font>

337
00:31:34.533 --> 00:31:39.705
<font color="#707070">I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.</font>

338
00:31:39.872 --> 00:31:42.124
<font color="#707070">~ That's likely.
~ That's likely.</font>

339
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.921
<font color="#707070">The Ministry of Magic
has always considered....</font>

340
00:31:48.088 --> 00:31:53.719
<font color="#707070">....the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance.</font>

341
00:31:54.052 --> 00:31:56.346
<font color="#707070">Although each headmaster....</font>

342
00:31:56.513 --> 00:32:01.351
<font color="#707070">....has brought something new to this historic school....</font>

343
00:32:02.895 --> 00:32:09.067
<font color="#707070">....progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged.</font>

344
00:32:09.776 --> 00:32:13.614
<font color="#707070">Let us preserve
what must be preserved....</font>

345
00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:17.284
<font color="#707070">....perfect what can be perfected....</font>

346
00:32:17.451 --> 00:32:24.082
<font color="#707070">....and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.</font>

347
00:32:31.131 --> 00:32:35.260
<font color="#707070">Thank you, Professor Umbridge. That really was most illuminating.</font>

348
00:32:35.427 --> 00:32:39.765
<font color="#707070">~ Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
~ What's it mean?</font>

349
00:32:40.516 --> 00:32:42.684
<font color="#707070">Magic is forbidden in the corridors....</font>

350
00:32:42.851 --> 00:32:46.438
<font color="#707070">It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.</font>

351
00:33:06.208 --> 00:33:07.960
<font color="#707070">Dean, Seamus.</font>

352
00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:10.379
<font color="#707070">~ Good holiday?
~ All right.</font>

353
00:33:10.754 --> 00:33:12.965
<font color="#707070">Better than Seamus', anyway.</font>

354
00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:16.635
<font color="#707070">Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.</font>

355
00:33:16.802 --> 00:33:20.097
<font color="#707070">~ Why not?
~ Let me see. Because of you.</font>

356
00:33:20.514 --> 00:33:23.892
<font color="#707070">The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot of things about you and Dumbledore.</font>

357
00:33:24.059 --> 00:33:25.394
<font color="#707070">What, your mum believes them?</font>

358
00:33:25.561 --> 00:33:27.479
<font color="#707070">Nobody was there
the night Cedric died.</font>

359
00:33:27.646 --> 00:33:30.732
<font color="#707070">I guess you should read the Prophet, then, like your stupid mother.</font>

360
00:33:30.899 --> 00:33:34.403
<font color="#707070">~ Don't talk about my mother.
~ I'll have a go at anyone calling me a liar.</font>

361
00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.072
<font color="#707070">~ What's going on?
~ He's mad, is what's going on.</font>

362
00:33:37.239 --> 00:33:40.325
<font color="#707070">Do you believe the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who?</font>

363
00:33:40.492 --> 00:33:42.161
<font color="#707070">Yeah. I do.</font>

364
00:33:43.162 --> 00:33:45.122
<font color="#707070">Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?</font>

365
00:33:54.548 --> 00:33:56.968
<font color="#707070">~ You all right?
~ Fine.</font>

366
00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:59.929
<font color="#707070">Seamus was bang out of order, mate.</font>

367
00:34:00.513 --> 00:34:04.267
<font color="#707070">~ But he'll come through, you'll see.
~ I said, I'm fine, Ron.</font>

368
00:34:07.937 --> 00:34:12.358
<font color="#707070">Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then.</font>

369
00:34:40.762 --> 00:34:41.805
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

370
00:34:57.237 --> 00:34:59.405
<font color="#707070">Bring it over here. Over here.</font>

371
00:35:00.323 --> 00:35:03.201
<font color="#707070">Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.</font>

372
00:35:18.842 --> 00:35:20.260
<font color="#707070">Good morning, children.</font>

373
00:35:22.262 --> 00:35:27.433
<font color="#707070">Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.</font>

374
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.186
<font color="#707070">O- W-Ls.</font>

375
00:35:30.353 --> 00:35:34.941
<font color="#707070">More commonly known as OWLs.</font>

376
00:35:35.108 --> 00:35:38.236
<font color="#707070">Study hard and you will be rewarded.</font>

377
00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:43.825
<font color="#707070">Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.</font>

378
00:35:49.414 --> 00:35:54.461
<font color="#707070">Your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly uneven.</font>

379
00:35:54.627 --> 00:35:56.796
<font color="#707070">But you'll be pleased to know, from now on....</font>

380
00:35:56.963 --> 00:36:00.467
<font color="#707070">....you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved....</font>

381
00:36:00.633 --> 00:36:03.303
<font color="#707070">....course of defensive magic. Yes?</font>

382
00:36:04.637 --> 00:36:07.265
<font color="#707070">There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?</font>

383
00:36:07.432 --> 00:36:08.975
<font color="#707070">Using spells?</font>

384
00:36:09.142 --> 00:36:12.604
<font color="#707070">Well, I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom.</font>

385
00:36:14.314 --> 00:36:15.899
<font color="#707070">We're not gonna use magic?</font>

386
00:36:16.065 --> 00:36:21.070
<font color="#707070">You'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way.</font>

387
00:36:21.237 --> 00:36:23.990
<font color="#707070">What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.</font>

388
00:36:24.157 --> 00:36:27.118
<font color="#707070">Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class.</font>

389
00:36:30.747 --> 00:36:33.166
<font color="#707070">It is the view of the Ministry....</font>

390
00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:36.085
<font color="#707070">....that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient....</font>

391
00:36:36.252 --> 00:36:38.213
<font color="#707070">....to get you through
your examinations....</font>

392
00:36:38.379 --> 00:36:40.840
<font color="#707070">....which, after all,
is what school is all about.</font>

393
00:36:41.007 --> 00:36:43.802
<font color="#707070">And how's theory supposed
to prepare us for what's out there?</font>

394
00:36:43.968 --> 00:36:46.012
<font color="#707070">There is nothing out there, dear.</font>

395
00:36:46.179 --> 00:36:49.182
<font color="#707070">Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?</font>

396
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:52.644
<font color="#707070">Oh, I don't know.
Maybe Lord Voldemort.</font>

397
00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:07.826
<font color="#707070">Now, let me make this quite plain.</font>

398
00:37:08.368 --> 00:37:09.828
<font color="#707070">You have been told....</font>

399
00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:15.375
<font color="#707070">....that a certain dark wizard is at large once again.</font>

400
00:37:15.542 --> 00:37:20.672
<font color="#707070">~ This is a lie.
~ It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.</font>

401
00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:22.465
<font color="#707070">Detention, Mr. Potter.</font>

402
00:37:22.632 --> 00:37:24.801
<font color="#707070">Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?</font>

403
00:37:24.968 --> 00:37:27.387
<font color="#707070">Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.</font>

404
00:37:27.554 --> 00:37:29.722
<font color="#707070">It was murder. Voldemort killed him.</font>

405
00:37:29.889 --> 00:37:31.391
<font color="#707070">Enough!</font>

406
00:37:32.058 --> 00:37:33.726
<font color="#707070">Enough.</font>

407
00:37:33.893 --> 00:37:38.231
<font color="#707070">See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.</font>

408
00:38:02.964 --> 00:38:04.174
<font color="#707070">Come in.</font>

409
00:38:09.429 --> 00:38:11.347
<font color="#707070">Good evening, Mr. Potter.</font>

410
00:38:11.973 --> 00:38:13.266
<font color="#707070">Sit.</font>

411
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.861
<font color="#707070">You're going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter.</font>

412
00:38:25.028 --> 00:38:26.905
<font color="#707070">No, not with your quill.</font>

413
00:38:27.113 --> 00:38:30.325
<font color="#707070">Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.</font>

414
00:38:35.455 --> 00:38:36.873
<font color="#707070">Now....</font>

415
00:38:37.832 --> 00:38:43.713
<font color="#707070">....I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."</font>

416
00:38:45.799 --> 00:38:47.675
<font color="#707070">How many times?</font>

417
00:38:48.134 --> 00:38:52.806
<font color="#707070">Well, let's say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in.</font>

418
00:38:54.808 --> 00:38:56.476
<font color="#707070">You haven't given me any ink.</font>

419
00:38:56.643 --> 00:38:58.144
<font color="#707070">Oh, you won't need any ink.</font>

420
00:39:49.363 --> 00:39:50.865
<font color="#707070">Yes?</font>

421
00:39:58.205 --> 00:40:01.584
<font color="#707070">~ Nothing.
~ That's right.</font>

422
00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:06.464
<font color="#707070">Because you know, deep down....</font>

423
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:08.716
<font color="#707070">....you deserve to be punished.</font>

424
00:40:09.884 --> 00:40:12.052
<font color="#707070">Don't you, Mr. Potter?</font>

425
00:40:16.265 --> 00:40:17.892
<font color="#707070">Go on.</font>

426
00:40:26.901 --> 00:40:29.195
<font color="#707070">~ Skiving Snackboxes.
~ Sweets that make you ill.</font>

427
00:40:29.361 --> 00:40:30.988
<font color="#707070">Get out of class whenever you like.</font>

428
00:40:31.155 --> 00:40:34.909
<font color="#707070">Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.</font>

429
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.244
<font color="#707070">Care for another?</font>

430
00:40:37.411 --> 00:40:39.955
<font color="#707070">~ I'm not asking you to write all of it.
~ Please.</font>

431
00:40:40.122 --> 00:40:43.083
<font color="#707070">I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.</font>

432
00:40:43.584 --> 00:40:45.377
<font color="#707070">I'll do the introduction. That's all.</font>

433
00:40:45.544 --> 00:40:49.298
<font color="#707070">Hermione, you're honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met.</font>

434
00:40:49.465 --> 00:40:53.719
<font color="#707070">~ And if I'm ever rude to you again....
~ I'll know you've gone back to normal.</font>

435
00:40:58.766 --> 00:41:00.851
<font color="#707070">What's wrong with your hand?</font>

436
00:41:01.393 --> 00:41:02.853
<font color="#707070">Nothing.</font>

437
00:41:04.104 --> 00:41:06.023
<font color="#707070">The other hand.</font>

438
00:41:08.526 --> 00:41:10.361
<font color="#707070">~ You've got to tell Dumbledore.
~ No.</font>

439
00:41:10.528 --> 00:41:12.738
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.</font>

440
00:41:12.905 --> 00:41:15.032
<font color="#707070">I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.</font>

441
00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:17.618
<font color="#707070">Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.</font>

442
00:41:17.785 --> 00:41:21.747
<font color="#707070">~ If the parents knew about this....
~ I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?</font>

443
00:41:24.542 --> 00:41:27.002
<font color="#707070">Harry, you've got to report this.</font>

444
00:41:27.169 --> 00:41:30.714
<font color="#707070">~ It's perfectly simple. You're being....
~ No, it's not.</font>

445
00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:33.717
<font color="#707070">Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.</font>

446
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.804
<font color="#707070">You don't understand.</font>

447
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.308
<font color="#707070">Then help us to.</font>

448
00:41:56.031 --> 00:41:57.908
<font color="#707070">Dear Padfoot....</font>

449
00:41:58.451 --> 00:42:00.161
<font color="#707070">....I hope you're all right.</font>

450
00:42:00.327 --> 00:42:04.957
<font color="#707070">It's starting to get colder here. Winter is definitely on the way.</font>

451
00:42:07.585 --> 00:42:12.339
<font color="#707070">In spite of being back at Hogwarts, I feel more alone than ever.</font>

452
00:42:13.174 --> 00:42:16.510
<font color="#707070">I know you, of all people, will understand.</font>

453
00:42:50.586 --> 00:42:52.797
<font color="#707070">Hello, Harry Potter.</font>

454
00:42:55.424 --> 00:43:00.054
<font color="#707070">~ Your feet. Aren't they cold?
~ Bit.</font>

455
00:43:00.971 --> 00:43:05.017
<font color="#707070">Unfortunately, all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared.</font>

456
00:43:05.559 --> 00:43:08.646
<font color="#707070">I suspect Nargles are behind it.</font>

457
00:43:14.985 --> 00:43:18.614
<font color="#707070">~ What are they?
~ They're called Thestrals.</font>

458
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:24.370
<font color="#707070">They're quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they're 
a bit....</font>

459
00:43:27.289 --> 00:43:28.916
<font color="#707070">Different.</font>

460
00:43:32.044 --> 00:43:34.421
<font color="#707070">But why can't the others see them?</font>

461
00:43:34.588 --> 00:43:38.092
<font color="#707070">They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.</font>

462
00:43:40.219 --> 00:43:42.847
<font color="#707070">So you've known someone
who's died, then?</font>

463
00:43:43.013 --> 00:43:44.640
<font color="#707070">My mum.</font>

464
00:43:45.182 --> 00:43:50.104
<font color="#707070">She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment....</font>

465
00:43:50.271 --> 00:43:53.566
<font color="#707070">....and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.</font>

466
00:43:53.732 --> 00:43:56.110
<font color="#707070">~ I was 9.
~ I'm sorry.</font>

467
00:43:56.694 --> 00:43:58.904
<font color="#707070">Yes, it was rather horrible.</font>

468
00:43:59.071 --> 00:44:04.410
<font color="#707070">I do feel very sad about it sometimes, but I've got Dad.</font>

469
00:44:06.621 --> 00:44:09.291
<font color="#707070">We both believe you, by the way.</font>

470
00:44:12.335 --> 00:44:15.338
<font color="#707070">That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and you fought him....</font>

471
00:44:15.505 --> 00:44:18.633
<font color="#707070">....and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you.</font>

472
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:23.138
<font color="#707070">Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do.</font>

473
00:44:23.305 --> 00:44:24.639
<font color="#707070">I don't think that's true.</font>

474
00:44:27.017 --> 00:44:30.145
<font color="#707070">But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.</font>

475
00:44:30.312 --> 00:44:32.105
<font color="#707070">What do you mean?</font>

476
00:44:32.731 --> 00:44:34.608
<font color="#707070">Well, if I were You-Know-Who....</font>

477
00:44:35.066 --> 00:44:38.653
<font color="#707070">....I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else....</font>

478
00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.531
<font color="#707070">....because if it's just you alone....</font>

479
00:44:42.365 --> 00:44:44.701
<font color="#707070">....you're not as much of a threat.</font>

480
00:45:02.344 --> 00:45:07.098
<font color="#707070">~ Do you ever stop eating?
~ What? I'm hungry.</font>

481
00:45:10.477 --> 00:45:11.520
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

482
00:45:13.355 --> 00:45:14.606
<font color="#707070">Can I join you?</font>

483
00:45:16.525 --> 00:45:19.653
<font color="#707070">Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?</font>

484
00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:22.572
<font color="#707070">I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students....</font>

485
00:45:22.739 --> 00:45:27.035
<font color="#707070">....you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices.</font>

486
00:45:27.202 --> 00:45:28.870
<font color="#707070">So silly of me, but it sounds....</font>

487
00:45:29.037 --> 00:45:33.166
<font color="#707070">....as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom....</font>

488
00:45:33.333 --> 00:45:34.668
<font color="#707070">....Minerva.</font>

489
00:45:34.835 --> 00:45:39.297
<font color="#707070">Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.</font>

490
00:45:39.548 --> 00:45:42.050
<font color="#707070">I am sorry, dear.</font>

491
00:45:42.217 --> 00:45:45.554
<font color="#707070">But to question my practices is to question the Ministry....</font>

492
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.849
<font color="#707070">....and by extension,
the minister himself.</font>

493
00:45:49.015 --> 00:45:50.600
<font color="#707070">I am a tolerant woman....</font>

494
00:45:50.767 --> 00:45:55.856
<font color="#707070">....but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.</font>

495
00:45:57.607 --> 00:45:59.401
<font color="#707070">Disloyalty.</font>

496
00:46:01.111 --> 00:46:05.073
<font color="#707070">Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.</font>

497
00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.743
<font color="#707070">Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.</font>

498
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:22.048
<font color="#707070">What's happened to Dumbledore?</font>

499
00:46:22.215 --> 00:46:24.759
<font color="#707070">Having already revolutionized....</font>

500
00:46:24.926 --> 00:46:27.596
<font color="#707070">....the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts....</font>

501
00:46:29.264 --> 00:46:32.767
<font color="#707070">....Dolores Umbridge will, as high inquisitor, have powers....</font>

502
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:39.441
<font color="#707070">....to address the seriously falling standards at Hogwarts School.</font>

503
00:46:47.199 --> 00:46:49.367
<font color="#707070">Just one question, dear.</font>

504
00:46:49.534 --> 00:46:53.747
<font color="#707070">You've been in this post
how long, exactly?</font>

505
00:47:00.545 --> 00:47:05.634
<font color="#707070">You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct?</font>

506
00:47:05.801 --> 00:47:07.803
<font color="#707070">Yes.</font>

507
00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.847
<font color="#707070">But you were unsuccessful?</font>

508
00:47:12.057 --> 00:47:14.476
<font color="#707070">Obviously.</font>

509
00:47:46.842 --> 00:47:50.262
<font color="#707070">Could you please predict something for me?</font>

510
00:47:52.013 --> 00:47:53.181
<font color="#707070">I'm sorry?</font>

511
00:47:58.436 --> 00:48:00.647
<font color="#707070">Move those mouths.</font>

512
00:48:06.778 --> 00:48:09.865
<font color="#707070">One teensy little prophecy?</font>

513
00:48:15.745 --> 00:48:17.205
<font color="#707070">Pity.</font>

514
00:48:17.747 --> 00:48:20.167
<font color="#707070">No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.</font>

515
00:48:20.333 --> 00:48:22.544
<font color="#707070">Yes, I do. Something dark.</font>

516
00:48:22.794 --> 00:48:27.340
<font color="#707070">You are in grave danger.</font>

517
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.552
<font color="#707070">Lovely.</font>

518
00:48:40.729 --> 00:48:42.898
<font color="#707070">Cho. What's going on?</font>

519
00:48:43.064 --> 00:48:45.400
<font color="#707070">It's Professor Trelawney.</font>

520
00:49:15.223 --> 00:49:18.726
<font color="#707070">Sixteen years I've lived
and taught here.</font>

521
00:49:18.893 --> 00:49:21.813
<font color="#707070">Hogwarts is my home.</font>

522
00:49:23.731 --> 00:49:25.608
<font color="#707070">You can't do this.</font>

523
00:49:27.068 --> 00:49:29.320
<font color="#707070">Actually, I can.</font>

524
00:49:38.204 --> 00:49:39.580
<font color="#707070">Something you'd like to say?</font>

525
00:49:39.747 --> 00:49:42.416
<font color="#707070">Oh, there are several things I would like to say.</font>

526
00:49:42.959 --> 00:49:44.544
<font color="#707070">There....</font>

527
00:49:58.474 --> 00:50:03.146
<font color="#707070">Professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside?</font>

528
00:50:04.438 --> 00:50:06.899
<font color="#707070">Sybil, dear. This way.</font>

529
00:50:07.066 --> 00:50:08.568
<font color="#707070">Thank you.</font>

530
00:50:09.735 --> 00:50:13.781
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms....</font>

531
00:50:13.948 --> 00:50:17.201
<font color="#707070">....of Educational Decree Number 23, as enacted by the minister....</font>

532
00:50:17.368 --> 00:50:20.538
<font color="#707070">You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.</font>

533
00:50:20.705 --> 00:50:24.292
<font color="#707070">You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds.</font>

534
00:50:24.459 --> 00:50:27.503
<font color="#707070">That power remains
with the headmaster.</font>

535
00:50:29.505 --> 00:50:30.756
<font color="#707070">For now.</font>

536
00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.182
<font color="#707070">Don't you all have studying to do?</font>

537
00:50:39.348 --> 00:50:40.516
<font color="#707070">Professor.</font>

538
00:50:42.351 --> 00:50:43.478
<font color="#707070">Professor?</font>

539
00:50:43.936 --> 00:50:46.731
<font color="#707070">Professor Dumbledore. Professor!</font>

540
00:50:46.898 --> 00:50:49.025
<font color="#707070">Professor Dumbledore.</font>

541
00:50:59.702 --> 00:51:01.829
<font color="#707070">That foul, evil, old gargoyle.</font>

542
00:51:02.371 --> 00:51:04.540
<font color="#707070">We're not learning
how to defend ourselves.</font>

543
00:51:04.707 --> 00:51:07.376
<font color="#707070">We're not learning
how to pass our OWLs.</font>

544
00:51:07.752 --> 00:51:09.796
<font color="#707070">She's taking over the entire school.</font>

545
00:51:09.962 --> 00:51:14.634
<font color="#707070">Security has been and will remain the Ministry's top priority.</font>

546
00:51:14.801 --> 00:51:17.637
<font color="#707070">Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence....</font>

547
00:51:17.804 --> 00:51:20.681
<font color="#707070">....that these disappearances are the work....</font>

548
00:51:20.848 --> 00:51:24.227
<font color="#707070">....of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.</font>

549
00:51:24.977 --> 00:51:26.562
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

550
00:51:26.771 --> 00:51:28.481
<font color="#707070">Sirius.</font>

551
00:51:29.232 --> 00:51:31.901
<font color="#707070">~ What are you doing here?
~ Answering your letter.</font>

552
00:51:32.068 --> 00:51:34.987
<font color="#707070">You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?</font>

553
00:51:35.154 --> 00:51:37.073
<font color="#707070">Training you to kill half-breeds?</font>

554
00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.243
<font color="#707070">~ She's not letting us use magic at all.
~ Well, I'm not surprised.</font>

555
00:51:40.576 --> 00:51:44.622
<font color="#707070">The latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat.</font>

556
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:45.832
<font color="#707070">Combat?</font>

557
00:51:46.332 --> 00:51:49.252
<font color="#707070">What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?</font>

558
00:51:49.418 --> 00:51:50.795
<font color="#707070">That's exactly what he thinks.</font>

559
00:51:50.962 --> 00:51:54.924
<font color="#707070">That Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry.</font>

560
00:51:55.424 --> 00:51:58.761
<font color="#707070">He's becoming more paranoid by the minute.</font>

561
00:51:59.095 --> 00:52:02.598
<font color="#707070">The others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry....</font>

562
00:52:03.099 --> 00:52:05.935
<font color="#707070">....but things aren't going at all well with the Order.</font>

563
00:52:06.102 --> 00:52:08.771
<font color="#707070">Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn....</font>

564
00:52:08.938 --> 00:52:12.942
<font color="#707070">....and these disappearances are just how it started before.</font>

565
00:52:13.734 --> 00:52:17.071
<font color="#707070">Voldemort is on the move.</font>

566
00:52:17.447 --> 00:52:18.865
<font color="#707070">Well, what can we do?</font>

567
00:52:19.449 --> 00:52:20.908
<font color="#707070">Someone's coming.</font>

568
00:52:21.075 --> 00:52:23.286
<font color="#707070">I'm sorry I can't be of more help.</font>

569
00:52:23.453 --> 00:52:28.458
<font color="#707070">But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.</font>

570
00:52:39.969 --> 00:52:42.305
<font color="#707070">He really is out there, isn't he?</font>

571
00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.809
<font color="#707070">We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.</font>

572
00:52:47.393 --> 00:52:51.147
<font color="#707070">And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will.</font>

573
00:53:08.164 --> 00:53:10.333
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

574
00:53:19.926 --> 00:53:22.303
<font color="#707070">This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?</font>

575
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:23.679
<font color="#707070">I'm a nutter, remember?</font>

576
00:53:23.846 --> 00:53:28.351
<font color="#707070">Look on the bright side: You can't be any worse than old toad face.</font>

577
00:53:28.601 --> 00:53:32.063
<font color="#707070">~ Thanks, Ron.
~ I'm here for you, mate.</font>

578
00:53:32.563 --> 00:53:34.899
<font color="#707070">Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?</font>

579
00:53:35.066 --> 00:53:37.193
<font color="#707070">Just a couple of people.</font>

580
00:53:42.198 --> 00:53:43.658
<font color="#707070">Lovely spot.</font>

581
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:49.497
<font color="#707070">Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.</font>

582
00:53:49.664 --> 00:53:51.833
<font color="#707070">Matey, come back here.</font>

583
00:54:00.258 --> 00:54:01.425
<font color="#707070">Hi.</font>

584
00:54:01.843 --> 00:54:04.720
<font color="#707070">So you all know why we're here.</font>

585
00:54:04.887 --> 00:54:06.139
<font color="#707070">We need a teacher.</font>

586
00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:10.017
<font color="#707070">A proper teacher.</font>

587
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:13.479
<font color="#707070">One who's had experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts.</font>

588
00:54:13.646 --> 00:54:15.399
<font color="#707070">~ Why?
~ Why?</font>

589
00:54:15.566 --> 00:54:17.651
<font color="#707070">Because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot.</font>

590
00:54:17.818 --> 00:54:19.403
<font color="#707070">~ So he says.
~ So Dumbledore says.</font>

591
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:21.697
<font color="#707070">So Dumbledore says because he says.</font>

592
00:54:21.864 --> 00:54:24.241
<font color="#707070">The point is, where's the proof?</font>

593
00:54:25.617 --> 00:54:28.662
<font color="#707070">If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed....</font>

594
00:54:31.748 --> 00:54:35.544
<font color="#707070">I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here, clear out now.</font>

595
00:54:35.711 --> 00:54:39.131
<font color="#707070">Come on, Hermione. They're here because they think I'm some freak.</font>

596
00:54:39.298 --> 00:54:41.925
<font color="#707070">Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?</font>

597
00:54:45.262 --> 00:54:46.680
<font color="#707070">Yes.</font>

598
00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.600
<font color="#707070">I've seen it.</font>

599
00:54:49.766 --> 00:54:51.894
<font color="#707070">Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.</font>

600
00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:56.690
<font color="#707070">And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office.</font>

601
00:54:56.857 --> 00:54:58.108
<font color="#707070">It's true.</font>

602
00:54:58.275 --> 00:55:01.028
<font color="#707070">Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.</font>

603
00:55:02.321 --> 00:55:05.115
<font color="#707070">Last year, he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh.</font>

604
00:55:05.282 --> 00:55:06.617
<font color="#707070">Wait.</font>

605
00:55:07.284 --> 00:55:11.830
<font color="#707070">Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that....</font>

606
00:55:11.997 --> 00:55:15.584
<font color="#707070">....but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.</font>

607
00:55:15.834 --> 00:55:19.588
<font color="#707070">I didn't know what I was doing half the time. I nearly always had help.</font>

608
00:55:19.755 --> 00:55:23.258
<font color="#707070">~ He's just being modest.
~ No, Hermione, I'm not.</font>

609
00:55:25.803 --> 00:55:30.474
<font color="#707070">Facing this stuff in real life is not like school.</font>

610
00:55:31.517 --> 00:55:34.978
<font color="#707070">In school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow.</font>

611
00:55:35.145 --> 00:55:36.647
<font color="#707070">But out there....</font>

612
00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:40.526
<font color="#707070">....when you're a second away from being murdered....</font>

613
00:55:40.692 --> 00:55:44.404
<font color="#707070">....or watching a friend die right before your eyes....</font>

614
00:55:47.157 --> 00:55:48.992
<font color="#707070">You don't know what that's like.</font>

615
00:55:58.752 --> 00:56:00.671
<font color="#707070">You're right, Harry, we don't.</font>

616
00:56:01.421 --> 00:56:03.507
<font color="#707070">That's why we need your help.</font>

617
00:56:03.674 --> 00:56:06.593
<font color="#707070">Because if we're going to have any chance at beating....</font>

618
00:56:08.804 --> 00:56:09.972
<font color="#707070">....Voldemort....</font>

619
00:56:13.392 --> 00:56:15.144
<font color="#707070">He's really back.</font>

620
00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:39.126
<font color="#707070">Right. First we need to find a place to practice....</font>

621
00:56:39.293 --> 00:56:40.711
<font color="#707070">....where Umbridge won't find out.</font>

622
00:56:40.878 --> 00:56:43.046
<font color="#707070">~ The Shrieking Shack.
~ It's too small.</font>

623
00:56:43.213 --> 00:56:46.175
<font color="#707070">~ Forbidden Forest?
~ Not bloody likely.</font>

624
00:56:46.341 --> 00:56:48.427
<font color="#707070">Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?</font>

625
00:56:48.594 --> 00:56:49.761
<font color="#707070">Who cares?</font>

626
00:56:50.387 --> 00:56:55.225
<font color="#707070">I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?</font>

627
00:56:55.392 --> 00:56:57.686
<font color="#707070">Who are you and what have you done with Hermione?</font>

628
00:56:58.395 --> 00:57:02.065
<font color="#707070">Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.</font>

629
00:57:02.232 --> 00:57:03.525
<font color="#707070">What's that?</font>

630
00:57:05.235 --> 00:57:07.905
<font color="#707070">Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?</font>

631
00:57:10.657 --> 00:57:13.744
<font color="#707070">Right. Over the next few days, we should each come up....</font>

632
00:57:13.911 --> 00:57:16.747
<font color="#707070">....with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice.</font>

633
00:57:16.914 --> 00:57:20.751
<font color="#707070">We've got to make sure, wherever it is, there's no chance she can find us.</font>

634
00:57:20.918 --> 00:57:22.753
<font color="#707070">Will do, Harry.</font>

635
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:35.599
<font color="#707070">All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.</font>

636
00:57:35.766 --> 00:57:39.394
<font color="#707070">Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.</font>

637
00:57:39.603 --> 00:57:42.064
<font color="#707070">Watch where you're going,
Longbottom.</font>

638
00:58:17.766 --> 00:58:22.020
<font color="#707070">You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.</font>

639
00:58:22.187 --> 00:58:23.313
<font color="#707070">The what?</font>

640
00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.899
<font color="#707070">It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.</font>

641
00:58:26.066 --> 00:58:29.486
<font color="#707070">The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it.</font>

642
00:58:29.653 --> 00:58:32.322
<font color="#707070">And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.</font>

643
00:58:32.489 --> 00:58:36.243
<font color="#707070">So say you really needed the toilet....</font>

644
00:58:37.411 --> 00:58:42.249
<font color="#707070">Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.</font>

645
00:58:42.416 --> 00:58:47.296
<font color="#707070">It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back.</font>

646
00:58:58.348 --> 00:58:59.850
<font color="#707070">Expelliarmus.</font>

647
00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.356
<font color="#707070">I'm hopeless.</font>

648
00:59:06.523 --> 00:59:10.319
<font color="#707070">You're just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.</font>

649
00:59:13.697 --> 00:59:17.701
<font color="#707070">You will please copy
the approved text four times....</font>

650
00:59:17.868 --> 00:59:20.872
<font color="#707070">....to ensure maximum retention.</font>

651
00:59:21.247 --> 00:59:24.959
<font color="#707070">~ There will be no need to talk.
~ No need to think's more like it.</font>

652
00:59:25.126 --> 00:59:27.170
<font color="#707070">~ Expelliarmus.
~ Wands away.</font>

653
00:59:40.099 --> 00:59:43.186
<font color="#707070">Stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal.</font>

654
00:59:43.353 --> 00:59:45.563
<font color="#707070">It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.</font>

655
00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:49.317
<font color="#707070">So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.</font>

656
00:59:55.824 --> 00:59:57.242
<font color="#707070">Stupefy!</font>

657
01:00:02.122 --> 01:00:06.584
<font color="#707070">Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.</font>

658
01:00:11.923 --> 01:00:14.050
<font color="#707070">Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.</font>

659
01:00:14.425 --> 01:00:16.427
<font color="#707070">Thanks, Ronald.</font>

660
01:00:19.097 --> 01:00:21.266
<font color="#707070">~ Come on, Ron.
~ Come on, Ron.</font>

661
01:00:21.432 --> 01:00:24.310
<font color="#707070">~ You can do it.
~ Come on, Ron.</font>

662
01:00:24.853 --> 01:00:26.896
<font color="#707070">~ One Sickle.
~ You're on.</font>

663
01:00:33.945 --> 01:00:35.280
<font color="#707070">Stupefy.</font>

664
01:00:40.952 --> 01:00:42.954
<font color="#707070">~ Thank you.
~ Shut up.</font>

665
01:00:43.329 --> 01:00:47.959
<font color="#707070">I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?</font>

666
01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:52.714
<font color="#707070">It was completely intentional.</font>

667
01:01:18.323 --> 01:01:21.284
<font color="#707070">Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?</font>

668
01:01:23.578 --> 01:01:27.540
<font color="#707070">Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.</font>

669
01:01:28.124 --> 01:01:30.084
<font color="#707070">Expelliarmus.</font>

670
01:01:31.669 --> 01:01:34.214
<font color="#707070">Very good. Keep your concentration.</font>

671
01:01:36.341 --> 01:01:37.842
<font color="#707070">Great.</font>

672
01:01:39.093 --> 01:01:40.678
<font color="#707070">A little higher.</font>

673
01:01:49.187 --> 01:01:52.023
<font color="#707070">I'm okay. I'm okay.</font>

675
01:02:14.212 --> 01:02:17.590
<font color="#707070">Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit....</font>

676
01:02:17.757 --> 01:02:20.635
<font color="#707070">....may sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.</font>

678
01:02:28.351 --> 01:02:32.647
<font color="#707070">Working hard is important, but there's something that matters even more:</font>

679
01:02:32.814 --> 01:02:35.024
<font color="#707070">Believing in yourself.</font>

680

<font color="#707070">~ Expelliarmus.
~ Levicorpus. Got it.</font>

681
01:02:37.485 --> 01:02:39.070
<font color="#707070">Think of it this way.</font>

682
01:02:39.237 --> 01:02:43.241
<font color="#707070">Every great wizard in history has started out....</font>

683
01:02:43.575 --> 01:02:47.454
<font color="#707070">....as nothing more
than what we are now: Students.</font>

684
01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:50.582
<font color="#707070">If they can do it, why not us?</font>

<font color="#707070">~ Stupefy.

692
01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:49.349
<font color="#707070">Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.</font>

693
01:03:50.975 --> 01:03:53.144
<font color="#707070">So that's it for this lesson.</font>

694
01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:56.689
<font color="#707070">Now, we're not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays.</font>

695
01:03:57.107 --> 01:04:00.151
<font color="#707070">So just keep practicing on your own as best you can.</font>

696
01:04:00.318 --> 01:04:03.655
<font color="#707070">And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.</font>

697
01:04:08.493 --> 01:04:09.911
<font color="#707070">Well done, mate.</font>

698
01:04:10.078 --> 01:04:11.496
<font color="#707070">Thanks.</font>

699
01:04:17.168 --> 01:04:19.546
<font color="#707070">See you after Christmas.</font>

700
01:04:29.014 --> 01:04:31.058
<font color="#707070">See you in the Common Room, Harry.</font>

701
01:04:32.476 --> 01:04:35.187
<font color="#707070">~ Thanks a lot, Harry.
~ No worries.</font>

702
01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:39.316
<font color="#707070">~ Thank you so much.
~ Not at all. Merry Christmas.</font>

703
01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:42.153
<font color="#707070">~ Thank you, Harry.
~ Thank you. Merry Christmas.</font>

704
01:04:42.319 --> 01:04:44.196
<font color="#707070">~ Merry Christmas.
~ Have a good Christmas.</font>

705
01:04:44.363 --> 01:04:46.949
<font color="#707070">~ Have a great Christmas, Luna.
~ We've been thinking.</font>

706
01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:49.535
<font color="#707070">We could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles.</font>

707
01:04:49.702 --> 01:04:52.371
<font color="#707070">Or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus-filled boils....</font>

708
01:04:52.538 --> 01:04:55.040
<font color="#707070">Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?</font>

709
01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:10.723
<font color="#707070">Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.</font>

710
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:13.267
<font color="#707070">Yeah. I'm okay.</font>

711
01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:16.770
<font color="#707070">Anyway, it's worth it.</font>

712
01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:25.279
<font color="#707070">It's just, learning all this....</font>

713
01:05:26.071 --> 01:05:29.533
<font color="#707070">....makes me wonder whether, if he'd known it....</font>

714
01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.411
<font color="#707070">Cedric did know this stuff.</font>

715
01:05:32.995 --> 01:05:35.414
<font color="#707070">He was really good.</font>

716
01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.751
<font color="#707070">It's just, Voldemort was better.</font>

717
01:05:43.297 --> 01:05:45.090
<font color="#707070">You're a really good teacher, Harry.</font>

718
01:05:46.383 --> 01:05:49.261
<font color="#707070">I've never been able
to stun anything before.</font>

719
01:05:58.437 --> 01:06:00.106
<font color="#707070">Mistletoe.</font>

720
01:06:03.609 --> 01:06:05.528
<font color="#707070">Probably full of Nargles, though.</font>

721
01:06:06.612 --> 01:06:08.280
<font color="#707070">What are Nargles?</font>

722
01:06:08.989 --> 01:06:10.741
<font color="#707070">No idea.</font>

723
01:06:32.763 --> 01:06:34.974
<font color="#707070">Well, how was it?</font>

724
01:06:35.724 --> 01:06:37.476
<font color="#707070">Wet.</font>

725
01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.645
<font color="#707070">I mean, she was sort of crying.</font>

726
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.981
<font color="#707070">That bad at it, are you?</font>

727
01:06:42.148 --> 01:06:44.900
<font color="#707070">I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.</font>

728
01:06:47.736 --> 01:06:49.905
<font color="#707070">Cho spends half her time
crying these days.</font>

729
01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:52.324
<font color="#707070">You'd think a bit of snogging would cheer her up.</font>

730
01:06:53.826 --> 01:06:56.662
<font color="#707070">Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?</font>

731
01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:04.545
<font color="#707070">Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric....</font>

732
01:07:04.712 --> 01:07:07.798
<font color="#707070">....and confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him....</font>

733
01:07:07.965 --> 01:07:11.177
<font color="#707070">....conflicted because Umbridge might sack her mum from the Ministry....</font>

734
01:07:11.343 --> 01:07:15.097
<font color="#707070">....and frightened of failing her OWLs because she's worrying about everything.</font>

735
01:07:17.016 --> 01:07:20.603
<font color="#707070">One person couldn't feel all that. They'd explode.</font>

736
01:07:20.769 --> 01:07:24.023
<font color="#707070">Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon....</font>

737
01:07:39.997 --> 01:07:41.540
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

738
01:07:50.299 --> 01:07:53.385
<font color="#707070">Voldemort may be after something.</font>

739
01:07:54.053 --> 01:07:57.056
<font color="#707070">Something he didn't have last time.</font>

740
01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:59.141
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

741
01:08:00.768 --> 01:08:02.019
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

742
01:08:33.134 --> 01:08:36.554
<font color="#707070">In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim....</font>

743
01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.222
<font color="#707070">....or looking down at the scene?</font>

744
01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:41.642
<font color="#707070">Neither. It was like I....</font>

745
01:08:42.226 --> 01:08:44.311
<font color="#707070">Will you please just tell me what's happening?</font>

746
01:08:44.478 --> 01:08:46.814
<font color="#707070">Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.</font>

747
01:08:46.981 --> 01:08:49.358
<font color="#707070">Make sure he's found
by the right people.</font>

748
01:08:49.567 --> 01:08:51.152
<font color="#707070">~ Sir.
~ Phineas.</font>

749
01:08:51.318 --> 01:08:53.612
<font color="#707070">You must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place.</font>

750
01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:56.407
<font color="#707070">Tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured....</font>

751
01:08:56.574 --> 01:09:00.744
<font color="#707070">....and his children will be arriving there soon by Portkey.</font>

752
01:09:00.911 --> 01:09:03.998
<font color="#707070">They've got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it.</font>

753
01:09:04.165 --> 01:09:06.625
<font color="#707070">What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.</font>

754
01:09:06.834 --> 01:09:08.752
<font color="#707070">Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to....</font>

755
01:09:08.919 --> 01:09:10.129
<font color="#707070">Look at me!</font>

756
01:09:16.635 --> 01:09:18.846
<font color="#707070">What's happening to me?</font>

757
01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.607
<font color="#707070">You wished to see me, headmaster?</font>

758
01:09:28.774 --> 01:09:33.695
<font color="#707070">Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning.</font>

759
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:36.990
<font color="#707070">Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.</font>

760
01:09:41.745 --> 01:09:43.371
<font color="#707070">It appears there's a connection....</font>

761
01:09:43.538 --> 01:09:45.874
<font color="#707070">....between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.</font>

762
01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:50.212
<font color="#707070">Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear.</font>

763
01:09:50.545 --> 01:09:53.590
<font color="#707070">Pray he remains ignorant.</font>

764
01:09:53.757 --> 01:09:57.052
<font color="#707070">You mean, if he knows about it, then....</font>

765
01:09:57.511 --> 01:10:01.890
<font color="#707070">....he'll be able to read my mind?
~ Read it, control it....</font>

766
01:10:02.057 --> 01:10:03.934
<font color="#707070">....unhinge it.</font>

767
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:07.479
<font color="#707070">In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure....</font>

768
01:10:07.646 --> 01:10:09.898
<font color="#707070">....to invade the minds of his victims....</font>

769
01:10:10.065 --> 01:10:13.652
<font color="#707070">....creating visions designed to torture them into madness.</font>

770
01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:19.574
<font color="#707070">Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony....</font>

771
01:10:19.741 --> 01:10:24.037
<font color="#707070">....only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally....</font>

772
01:10:24.204 --> 01:10:25.372
<font color="#707070">....kill them.</font>

773
01:10:26.414 --> 01:10:28.792
<font color="#707070">Used properly,
the power of Occlumency....</font>

774
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.504
<font color="#707070">....will help shield you
from access or influence.</font>

775
01:10:32.671 --> 01:10:37.425
<font color="#707070">In these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind.</font>

776
01:10:38.009 --> 01:10:41.096
<font color="#707070">You will attempt to resist.</font>

777
01:10:41.388 --> 01:10:42.848
<font color="#707070">Prepare yourself.</font>

778
01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.810
<font color="#707070">Legilimens.</font>

779
01:10:54.943 --> 01:10:58.530
<font color="#707070">Concentrate, Potter. Focus.</font>

780
01:11:24.431 --> 01:11:26.057
<font color="#707070">Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.</font>

781
01:11:27.267 --> 01:11:29.936
<font color="#707070">Here we go.</font>

782
01:11:30.103 --> 01:11:32.272
<font color="#707070">Daddy's back.</font>

783
01:11:35.442 --> 01:11:39.070
<font color="#707070">Sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, presents.</font>

784
01:11:39.237 --> 01:11:43.617
<font color="#707070">~ And a nice big box for Ron.
~ Big box for you. And....</font>

785
01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:48.622
<font color="#707070">Fred and George. Come on, open up.</font>

786
01:11:48.789 --> 01:11:51.082
<font color="#707070">~ I want to see your faces.
~ Yes.</font>

787
01:11:51.249 --> 01:11:53.627
<font color="#707070">~ Try it on.
~ Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.</font>

788
01:11:53.835 --> 01:11:58.131
<font color="#707070">~ Just what he wanted, actually.
~ Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.</font>

789
01:11:58.298 --> 01:12:01.176
<font color="#707070">Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.</font>

790
01:12:01.343 --> 01:12:03.345
<font color="#707070">Oh, Harry, Harry.</font>

791
01:12:03.512 --> 01:12:05.430
<font color="#707070">There you are.</font>

792
01:12:06.431 --> 01:12:08.266
<font color="#707070">~ Happy Christmas.
~ Thank you.</font>

793
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:10.685
<font color="#707070">~ Lovely to have you with us.
~ Thank you.</font>

794
01:12:10.852 --> 01:12:12.854
<font color="#707070">Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.</font>

795
01:12:13.021 --> 01:12:14.731
<font color="#707070">~ Thank you.
~ Has everybody got?</font>

796
01:12:14.898 --> 01:12:16.274
<font color="#707070">Fred? George?</font>

797
01:12:16.441 --> 01:12:18.985
<font color="#707070">~ Hermione.
~ A Christmas toast.</font>

798
01:12:19.152 --> 01:12:21.029
<font color="#707070">To Mr. Harry Potter....</font>

799
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:24.866
<font color="#707070">....without whom I would not be here.</font>

800
01:12:28.453 --> 01:12:30.789
<font color="#707070">~ Harry.
~ Harry.</font>

801
01:12:30.956 --> 01:12:32.207
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

802
01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:35.752
<font color="#707070">That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.</font>

803
01:12:35.961 --> 01:12:38.338
<font color="#707070">Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.</font>

804
01:12:39.256 --> 01:12:42.008
<font color="#707070">I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.</font>

805
01:12:43.468 --> 01:12:45.303
<font color="#707070">I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.</font>

806
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:47.305
<font color="#707070">No more than usual, Ron.</font>

807
01:12:47.514 --> 01:12:49.349
<font color="#707070">I don't know why....</font>

808
01:12:55.355 --> 01:12:59.943
<font color="#707070">Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.</font>

809
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:04.865
<font color="#707070">Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.</font>

810
01:13:05.031 --> 01:13:08.034
<font color="#707070">Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.</font>

811
01:13:08.452 --> 01:13:11.079
<font color="#707070">~ If my poor mistress only knew....
~ Kreacher!</font>

812
01:13:11.246 --> 01:13:14.082
<font color="#707070">That's enough of your bile. Away with you!</font>

813
01:13:14.249 --> 01:13:16.251
<font color="#707070">Of course, master.</font>

814
01:13:16.418 --> 01:13:21.089
<font color="#707070">Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.</font>

815
01:13:23.425 --> 01:13:25.302
<font color="#707070">Sorry about that.</font>

816
01:13:25.886 --> 01:13:29.556
<font color="#707070">He never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy.</font>

817
01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:31.975
<font color="#707070">Not to me, anyway.</font>

818
01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:34.769
<font color="#707070">What, you grew up here?</font>

819
01:13:34.936 --> 01:13:37.189
<font color="#707070">This is my parents' house.</font>

820
01:13:37.522 --> 01:13:41.359
<font color="#707070">I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order.</font>

821
01:13:42.486 --> 01:13:45.781
<font color="#707070">About the only useful thing I've been able to do.</font>

822
01:13:47.157 --> 01:13:49.534
<font color="#707070">This is the Black family tree.</font>

823
01:13:50.452 --> 01:13:52.579
<font color="#707070">My deranged cousin.</font>

824
01:13:52.746 --> 01:13:55.457
<font color="#707070">I hated the lot of them.</font>

825
01:13:55.624 --> 01:14:00.337
<font color="#707070">My parents with their pure-blood mania.</font>

826
01:14:03.548 --> 01:14:07.344
<font color="#707070">My mother did that after I ran away.</font>

827
01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:11.556
<font color="#707070">Charming woman.</font>

828
01:14:12.808 --> 01:14:14.476
<font color="#707070">I was 16.</font>

829
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:16.728
<font color="#707070">Where did you go?</font>

830
01:14:18.814 --> 01:14:20.065
<font color="#707070">Round your dad's.</font>

831
01:14:21.566 --> 01:14:24.111
<font color="#707070">I was always welcome at the Potters'.</font>

832
01:14:24.986 --> 01:14:27.739
<font color="#707070">I see him so much in you, Harry.</font>

833
01:14:28.365 --> 01:14:30.575
<font color="#707070">You are so very much alike.</font>

834
01:14:31.493 --> 01:14:33.496
<font color="#707070">I'm not so sure.</font>

835
01:14:34.539 --> 01:14:35.998
<font color="#707070">Sirius, when I was....</font>

836
01:14:38.835 --> 01:14:43.339
<font color="#707070">When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching.</font>

837
01:14:44.507 --> 01:14:46.008
<font color="#707070">I was the snake.</font>

838
01:14:46.843 --> 01:14:49.804
<font color="#707070">And afterwards,
in Dumbledore's office....</font>

839
01:14:49.971 --> 01:14:54.183
<font color="#707070">....there was a moment
when I wanted to....</font>

840
01:14:59.313 --> 01:15:02.191
<font color="#707070">This connection
between me and Voldemort.</font>

841
01:15:02.859 --> 01:15:06.446
<font color="#707070">What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?</font>

842
01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:12.702
<font color="#707070">I just feel so angry all the time.</font>

843
01:15:12.869 --> 01:15:17.415
<font color="#707070">And what if, after everything that I've been through....</font>

844
01:15:17.582 --> 01:15:21.169
<font color="#707070">....something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad?</font>

845
01:15:23.796 --> 01:15:27.049
<font color="#707070">I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry.</font>

846
01:15:28.217 --> 01:15:31.220
<font color="#707070">You're not a bad person.</font>

847
01:15:32.054 --> 01:15:36.392
<font color="#707070">You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.</font>

848
01:15:37.018 --> 01:15:38.102
<font color="#707070">You understand?</font>

849
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:45.276
<font color="#707070">Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters.</font>

850
01:15:45.443 --> 01:15:49.906
<font color="#707070">We've all got both light and dark inside of us.</font>

851
01:15:50.656 --> 01:15:53.910
<font color="#707070">What matters
is the part we choose to act on.</font>

852
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:58.164
<font color="#707070">That's who we really are.</font>

853
01:16:01.918 --> 01:16:03.669
<font color="#707070">Harry, time to go.</font>

854
01:16:05.421 --> 01:16:09.717
<font color="#707070">When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.</font>

855
01:16:09.884 --> 01:16:11.469
<font color="#707070">You'll see.</font>

856
01:16:12.595 --> 01:16:13.971
<font color="#707070">Come on.</font>

857
01:16:51.425 --> 01:16:52.593
<font color="#707070">Really?</font>

858
01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.388
<font color="#707070">Harry. Harry.</font>

859
01:16:55.555 --> 01:16:57.473
<font color="#707070">Hagrid's back.</font>

860
01:17:00.434 --> 01:17:02.270
<font color="#707070">I'm sorry.</font>

861
01:17:16.492 --> 01:17:19.662
<font color="#707070">I will say this one last time.</font>

862
01:17:19.954 --> 01:17:22.331
<font color="#707070">I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.</font>

863
01:17:22.498 --> 01:17:25.501
<font color="#707070">I told you. I've been away for me health.</font>

864
01:17:25.835 --> 01:17:30.006
<font color="#707070">~ Your health?
~ Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.</font>

865
01:17:30.173 --> 01:17:35.011
<font color="#707070">Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.</font>

866
01:17:37.054 --> 01:17:39.557
<font color="#707070">If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.</font>

867
01:17:39.724 --> 01:17:43.019
<font color="#707070">In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.</font>

868
01:18:01.954 --> 01:18:05.041
<font color="#707070">This is top-secret, right?</font>

869
01:18:05.958 --> 01:18:08.336
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.</font>

870
01:18:08.503 --> 01:18:10.004
<font color="#707070">Giants?</font>

871
01:18:11.214 --> 01:18:12.256
<font color="#707070">You found them?</font>

872
01:18:12.423 --> 01:18:16.260
<font color="#707070">Well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?</font>

873
01:18:17.178 --> 01:18:20.223
<font color="#707070">I tried to convince them
to join the cause.</font>

874
01:18:20.389 --> 01:18:23.059
<font color="#707070">But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.</font>

875
01:18:23.768 --> 01:18:25.686
<font color="#707070">~ Death Eaters?
~ Yes.</font>

876
01:18:26.145 --> 01:18:29.482
<font color="#707070">Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.</font>

877
01:18:29.982 --> 01:18:32.360
<font color="#707070">~ Did they?
~ I gave them Dumbledore's message.</font>

878
01:18:32.527 --> 01:18:36.614
<font color="#707070">Suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose.</font>

879
01:18:40.243 --> 01:18:41.494
<font color="#707070">And they did this to you?</font>

880
01:18:42.245 --> 01:18:43.996
<font color="#707070">Not exactly, no.</font>

881
01:18:44.497 --> 01:18:48.417
<font color="#707070">Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.</font>

882
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:04.517
<font color="#707070">It's changing out there.</font>

883
01:19:04.934 --> 01:19:06.519
<font color="#707070">Just like last time.</font>

884
01:19:07.979 --> 01:19:09.605
<font color="#707070">There's a storm coming, Harry.</font>

885
01:19:10.356 --> 01:19:13.443
<font color="#707070">We'd all best be ready when she does.</font>

886
01:19:50.439 --> 01:19:53.484
<font color="#707070">We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners....</font>

887
01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:56.487
<font color="#707070">....in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape.</font>

888
01:19:56.653 --> 01:20:00.324
<font color="#707070">And of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger.</font>

889
01:20:00.491 --> 01:20:02.576
<font color="#707070">We strongly suspect....</font>

890
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:05.412
<font color="#707070">....that the breakout was engineered....</font>

891
01:20:05.579 --> 01:20:09.792
<font color="#707070">....by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban....</font>

892
01:20:09.958 --> 01:20:14.171
<font color="#707070">....notorious mass murderer Sirius Black....</font>

893
01:20:15.631 --> 01:20:20.010
<font color="#707070">....cousin of escapee
Bellatrix Lestrange.</font>

894
01:20:30.312 --> 01:20:32.606
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.</font>

895
01:20:32.773 --> 01:20:35.943
<font color="#707070">He's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth.</font>

896
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:37.236
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

897
01:20:40.948 --> 01:20:42.950
<font color="#707070">I wanted to apologize.</font>

898
01:20:43.534 --> 01:20:47.704
<font color="#707070">Now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up.</font>

899
01:20:47.871 --> 01:20:53.794
<font color="#707070">So, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you.</font>

900
01:21:00.717 --> 01:21:02.344
<font color="#707070">Neville?</font>

901
01:21:14.898 --> 01:21:17.067
<font color="#707070">Fourteen years ago....</font>

902
01:21:17.234 --> 01:21:21.488
<font color="#707070">....a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange....</font>

903
01:21:21.655 --> 01:21:24.867
<font color="#707070">....used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.</font>

904
01:21:25.409 --> 01:21:29.413
<font color="#707070">She tortured them for information....</font>

905
01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.748
<font color="#707070">....but they never gave in.</font>

906
01:21:33.417 --> 01:21:35.919
<font color="#707070">I'm quite proud to be their son.</font>

907
01:21:36.879 --> 01:21:40.716
<font color="#707070">But I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.</font>

908
01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:50.809
<font color="#707070">We're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise.</font>

909
01:21:55.063 --> 01:21:58.734
<font color="#707070">Make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember.</font>

910
01:21:58.942 --> 01:22:02.362
<font color="#707070">Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.</font>

911
01:22:02.529 --> 01:22:03.947
<font color="#707070">George, your turn now.</font>

912
01:22:05.282 --> 01:22:07.618
<font color="#707070">Expecto Patronum.</font>

913
01:22:08.535 --> 01:22:11.955
<font color="#707070">A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce....</font>

914
01:22:12.122 --> 01:22:15.959
<font color="#707070">....but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents.</font>

915
01:22:16.126 --> 01:22:17.377
<font color="#707070">Wow, that was really good.</font>

916
01:22:18.086 --> 01:22:19.630
<font color="#707070">Fantastic, Ginny.</font>

917
01:22:19.797 --> 01:22:23.842
<font color="#707070">Just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused.</font>

918
01:22:24.009 --> 01:22:26.303
<font color="#707070">So focus, Luna.</font>

919
01:22:30.015 --> 01:22:31.725
<font color="#707070">Think of the happiest thing you can.</font>

920
01:22:31.892 --> 01:22:33.852
<font color="#707070">Expecto Patronum.</font>

921
01:22:34.019 --> 01:22:36.897
<font color="#707070">~ I'm trying.
~ I know. It's good.</font>

922
01:22:37.064 --> 01:22:41.318
<font color="#707070">This is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well.</font>

923
01:22:42.069 --> 01:22:44.446
<font color="#707070">Expecto Patronum.</font>

924
01:23:26.321 --> 01:23:28.866
<font color="#707070">I'll make short work of this.</font>

925
01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.202
<font color="#707070">Bombarda Maxima.</font>

926
01:23:50.471 --> 01:23:51.847
<font color="#707070">Get them.</font>

927
01:23:52.264 --> 01:23:53.724
<font color="#707070">Been watching them for weeks.</font>

928
01:23:53.891 --> 01:23:55.851
<font color="#707070">And see, "Dumbledore's Army"....</font>

929
01:23:56.268 --> 01:23:59.938
<font color="#707070">....proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius.</font>

930
01:24:01.356 --> 01:24:03.400
<font color="#707070">All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who....</font>

931
01:24:03.567 --> 01:24:05.110
<font color="#707070">....never fooled us for a minute.</font>

932
01:24:05.277 --> 01:24:07.362
<font color="#707070">We saw your lies for what they were:</font>

933
01:24:07.529 --> 01:24:11.283
<font color="#707070">A smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry.</font>

934
01:24:11.492 --> 01:24:12.534
<font color="#707070">Naturally.</font>

935
01:24:12.701 --> 01:24:15.245
<font color="#707070">No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.</font>

936
01:24:15.412 --> 01:24:19.082
<font color="#707070">Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out....</font>

937
01:24:19.249 --> 01:24:24.087
<font color="#707070">....the parchment clearly says "Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."</font>

938
01:24:24.254 --> 01:24:26.882
<font color="#707070">I instructed Harry
to form this organization.</font>

939
01:24:27.049 --> 01:24:30.511
<font color="#707070">And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.</font>

940
01:24:30.677 --> 01:24:32.513
<font color="#707070">Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.</font>

941
01:24:32.679 --> 01:24:35.224
<font color="#707070">If we hurry, we should still make the morning edition.</font>

942
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:40.187
<font color="#707070">Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore....</font>

943
01:24:40.354 --> 01:24:41.772
<font color="#707070">....to Azkaban....</font>

944
01:24:43.024 --> 01:24:48.154
<font color="#707070">....to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.</font>

945
01:24:48.363 --> 01:24:51.282
<font color="#707070">I thought we might hit this little snag.</font>

946
01:24:52.450 --> 01:24:55.912
<font color="#707070">You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to....</font>

947
01:24:56.454 --> 01:24:57.914
<font color="#707070">What was the phrase?</font>

948
01:24:58.081 --> 01:24:59.666
<font color="#707070">Come quietly.</font>

949
01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:01.543
<font color="#707070">Well, I can tell you this:</font>

950
01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.295
<font color="#707070">I have no intention
of going to Azkaban.</font>

951
01:25:04.462 --> 01:25:05.713
<font color="#707070">Enough of this.</font>

952
01:25:06.214 --> 01:25:07.298
<font color="#707070">Take him.</font>

953
01:25:20.145 --> 01:25:24.524
<font color="#707070">Well, you may not like him, minister....</font>

954
01:25:24.691 --> 01:25:26.818
<font color="#707070">....but you can't deny....</font>

955
01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.113
<font color="#707070">....Dumbledore has got style.</font>

956
01:25:54.179 --> 01:25:58.850
<font color="#707070">Boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other.</font>

957
01:25:59.017 --> 01:26:02.437
<font color="#707070">Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit....</font>

958
01:26:02.604 --> 01:26:07.650
<font color="#707070">Students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities.</font>

959
01:26:07.817 --> 01:26:12.113
<font color="#707070">Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.</font>

960
01:27:23.309 --> 01:27:24.936
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

961
01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:35.280
<font color="#707070">You did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.</font>

962
01:27:35.447 --> 01:27:37.782
<font color="#707070">Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.</font>

963
01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:40.869
<font color="#707070">Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.</font>

964
01:27:41.035 --> 01:27:43.121
<font color="#707070">Yeah, we talked you into it.</font>

965
01:27:43.288 --> 01:27:45.290
<font color="#707070">Yeah, but I agreed.</font>

966
01:27:45.832 --> 01:27:49.961
<font color="#707070">I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.</font>

967
01:27:52.005 --> 01:27:54.466
<font color="#707070">Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.</font>

968
01:27:55.508 --> 01:27:59.721
<font color="#707070">Because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much.</font>

969
01:27:59.888 --> 01:28:02.557
<font color="#707070">And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.</font>

970
01:28:02.724 --> 01:28:05.894
<font color="#707070">~ So maybe it's just better to....
~ To what?</font>

971
01:28:08.146 --> 01:28:10.064
<font color="#707070">To go it alone.</font>

972
01:28:16.404 --> 01:28:18.072
<font color="#707070">Hagrid.</font>

973
01:28:21.826 --> 01:28:24.204
<font color="#707070">Any idea where he's taking us?</font>

974
01:28:24.412 --> 01:28:27.499
<font color="#707070">Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?</font>

975
01:28:35.799 --> 01:28:38.468
<font color="#707070">I've never seen the centaurs so riled.</font>

976
01:28:38.635 --> 01:28:41.179
<font color="#707070">And they're dangerous
at the best of times.</font>

977
01:28:42.138 --> 01:28:44.474
<font color="#707070">The Ministry restricts
their territory much more....</font>

978
01:28:44.641 --> 01:28:46.851
<font color="#707070">....they'll have a full uprising on their hands.</font>

979
01:28:47.018 --> 01:28:48.686
<font color="#707070">Hagrid, what's going on?</font>

980
01:28:48.853 --> 01:28:51.064
<font color="#707070">I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.</font>

981
01:28:51.231 --> 01:28:56.194
<font color="#707070">I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone....</font>

982
01:28:56.861 --> 01:29:00.031
<font color="#707070">....I'll likely be getting the sack any day now.</font>

983
01:29:00.198 --> 01:29:03.701
<font color="#707070">And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.</font>

984
01:29:07.872 --> 01:29:09.541
<font color="#707070">Grawpy.</font>

985
01:29:11.918 --> 01:29:14.045
<font color="#707070">Down here, you great buffoon.</font>

986
01:29:20.385 --> 01:29:22.053
<font color="#707070">Grawpy.</font>

987
01:29:22.846 --> 01:29:24.556
<font color="#707070">Brought you some company.</font>

988
01:29:36.901 --> 01:29:39.154
<font color="#707070">I couldn't just leave him, because....</font>

989
01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.072
<font color="#707070">Because he's my brother.</font>

990
01:29:41.239 --> 01:29:42.365
<font color="#707070">Blimey.</font>

991
01:29:42.532 --> 01:29:44.576
<font color="#707070">Well, half brother, really.</font>

992
01:29:44.742 --> 01:29:49.957
<font color="#707070">He's completely harmless, just like I said. Little high-spirited, is all.</font>

993
01:29:52.126 --> 01:29:54.462
<font color="#707070">~ Grawpy, that is not polite.
~ Hagrid, do something.</font>

994
01:29:54.628 --> 01:29:57.006
<font color="#707070">We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?</font>

995
01:29:57.214 --> 01:29:59.467
<font color="#707070">That's your new friend, Hermione.</font>

996
01:29:59.633 --> 01:30:00.885
<font color="#707070">Grawpy.</font>

997
01:30:05.264 --> 01:30:06.432
<font color="#707070">Grawp.</font>

998
01:30:08.476 --> 01:30:11.562
<font color="#707070">Put me down.</font>

999
01:30:15.232 --> 01:30:16.776
<font color="#707070">Now.</font>

1000
01:30:28.954 --> 01:30:30.039
<font color="#707070">You all right?</font>

1001
01:30:31.332 --> 01:30:33.000
<font color="#707070">Fine.</font>

1002
01:30:33.417 --> 01:30:35.711
<font color="#707070">Just needs a firm hand, is all.</font>

1003
01:30:35.878 --> 01:30:38.255
<font color="#707070">I think you've got an admirer.</font>

1004
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.968
<font color="#707070">You just stay away from her, all right?</font>

1005
01:31:13.082 --> 01:31:15.835
<font color="#707070">He gets his own food and all.</font>

1006
01:31:17.086 --> 01:31:20.172
<font color="#707070">It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.</font>

1007
01:31:21.507 --> 01:31:23.717
<font color="#707070">You will look after him, won't you?</font>

1008
01:31:24.218 --> 01:31:26.929
<font color="#707070">I'm the only family he's got.</font>

1009
01:31:40.526 --> 01:31:42.361
<font color="#707070">Feeling sentimental?</font>

1010
01:31:45.656 --> 01:31:49.493
<font color="#707070">~ That's private.
~ Not to me.</font>

1011
01:31:49.785 --> 01:31:53.289
<font color="#707070">And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.</font>

1012
01:31:55.708 --> 01:31:58.878
<font color="#707070">Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you.</font>

1013
01:31:59.044 --> 01:32:03.215
<font color="#707070">You won't last two seconds if he invades your mind.</font>

1014
01:32:04.383 --> 01:32:06.635
<font color="#707070">You're just like your father.</font>

1015
01:32:06.802 --> 01:32:08.596
<font color="#707070">Lazy, arrogant.</font>

1016
01:32:08.762 --> 01:32:11.015
<font color="#707070">~ Don't say a word against my father.
~ Weak.</font>

1017
01:32:11.182 --> 01:32:13.350
<font color="#707070">~ I'm not weak.
~ Then prove it.</font>

1018
01:32:13.976 --> 01:32:15.895
<font color="#707070">Control your emotions.</font>

1019
01:32:16.061 --> 01:32:19.023
<font color="#707070">Discipline your mind.</font>

1020
01:32:21.859 --> 01:32:23.027
<font color="#707070">Legilimens.</font>

1021
01:32:30.242 --> 01:32:31.368
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

1022
01:32:31.535 --> 01:32:33.245
<font color="#707070">Sirius.</font>

1023
01:32:33.913 --> 01:32:35.247
<font color="#707070">I may vomit.</font>

1024
01:32:35.581 --> 01:32:36.624
<font color="#707070">Stop it.</font>

1025
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:40.044
<font color="#707070">Is this what you call control?</font>

1026
01:32:40.544 --> 01:32:43.589
<font color="#707070">We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest.</font>

1027
01:32:43.756 --> 01:32:47.176
<font color="#707070">The Dark Lord isn't resting.</font>

1028
01:32:48.803 --> 01:32:50.721
<font color="#707070">You and Black, you're two of a kind.</font>

1029
01:32:50.888 --> 01:32:54.809
Sentimental children forever whining
about how unfair your lives have been.</font>

1030
01:32:55.017 --> 01:32:58.395
<font color="#707070">Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair.</font>

1031
01:32:58.562 --> 01:33:02.483
<font color="#707070">Your blessed father knew that. In fact, he frequently saw to it.</font>

1032
01:33:02.691 --> 01:33:05.736
<font color="#707070">~ My father was a great man.
~ Your father was a swine.</font>

1033
01:33:06.779 --> 01:33:08.280
<font color="#707070">~ Legilimens.
~ Protego.</font>

1034
01:33:13.828 --> 01:33:15.371
<font color="#707070">Come on, Moony, Padfoot.</font>

1035
01:33:15.538 --> 01:33:17.623
<font color="#707070">Snape. Expelliarmus.</font>

1036
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:19.625
<font color="#707070">Nice one, James.</font>

1037
01:33:19.959 --> 01:33:22.294
<font color="#707070">~ Dad.
~ Impedimenta.</font>

1038
01:33:22.461 --> 01:33:24.463
<font color="#707070">Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.</font>

1039
01:33:24.630 --> 01:33:27.299
<font color="#707070">Right. Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers?</font>

1040
01:33:27.466 --> 01:33:29.718
<font color="#707070">Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.</font>

1041
01:33:29.885 --> 01:33:31.095
<font color="#707070">Enough.</font>

1042
01:33:33.055 --> 01:33:34.640
<font color="#707070">Enough.</font>

1043
01:33:43.149 --> 01:33:45.776
<font color="#707070">Your lessons are at an end.</font>

1044
01:33:45.943 --> 01:33:47.027
<font color="#707070">I....</font>

1045
01:33:47.236 --> 01:33:50.489
<font color="#707070">Get out.</font>

1046
01:34:07.715 --> 01:34:09.884
<font color="#707070">~ What's your name?
~ Michael.</font>

1047
01:34:10.050 --> 01:34:11.969
<font color="#707070">Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.</font>

1048
01:34:12.136 --> 01:34:15.181
<font color="#707070">Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?</font>

1049
01:34:15.347 --> 01:34:17.349
<font color="#707070">It's fading already.</font>

1050
01:34:17.516 --> 01:34:22.271
<font color="#707070">You can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while.</font>

1051
01:34:29.653 --> 01:34:32.364
<font color="#707070">As I told you once before, Mr. Potter....</font>

1052
01:34:32.531 --> 01:34:36.327
<font color="#707070">....naughty children
deserve to be punished.</font>

1053
01:34:39.371 --> 01:34:40.706
<font color="#707070">You know, George....</font>

1054
01:34:40.873 --> 01:34:44.543
<font color="#707070">....I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement.</font>

1055
01:34:44.710 --> 01:34:49.298
<font color="#707070">Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.</font>

1056
01:36:01.246 --> 01:36:02.914
<font color="#707070">All right, professor!</font>

1057
01:36:11.673 --> 01:36:13.467
<font color="#707070">Here you go.</font>

1058
01:36:38.408 --> 01:36:40.243
<font color="#707070">Ready when you are.</font>

1059
01:38:05.996 --> 01:38:09.249
<font color="#707070">I need that prophecy.</font>

1060
01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:11.251
<font color="#707070">You'll have to kill me.</font>

1061
01:38:12.085 --> 01:38:16.673
<font color="#707070">Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.</font>

1062
01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.550
<font color="#707070">Crucio.</font>

1063
01:38:21.094 --> 01:38:22.846
<font color="#707070">Crucio.</font>

1064
01:38:34.232 --> 01:38:35.692
<font color="#707070">Sirius.</font>

1065
01:38:35.859 --> 01:38:36.902
<font color="#707070">Harry, are you sure?</font>

1066
01:38:37.068 --> 01:38:39.488
<font color="#707070">I saw it. It's just like
with Mr. Weasley.</font>

1067
01:38:39.654 --> 01:38:41.531
<font color="#707070">It's the door I've been dreaming about.</font>

1068
01:38:41.698 --> 01:38:43.784
<font color="#707070">I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.</font>

1069
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:45.869
<font color="#707070">Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.</font>

1070
01:38:46.036 --> 01:38:49.331
<font color="#707070">Something he didn't have the last time, in the Department of Mysteries.</font>

1071
01:38:49.498 --> 01:38:51.458
<font color="#707070">Harry, please, just listen.</font>

1072
01:38:52.959 --> 01:38:54.961
<font color="#707070">What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?</font>

1073
01:38:56.254 --> 01:38:59.382
<font color="#707070">What if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you?</font>

1074
01:38:59.549 --> 01:39:03.053
<font color="#707070">What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?</font>

1075
01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:06.723
<font color="#707070">Hermione,
he's the only family I've got left.</font>

1076
01:39:09.267 --> 01:39:10.268
<font color="#707070">What do we do?</font>

1077
01:39:11.728 --> 01:39:13.355
<font color="#707070">We'll have to use the Floo Network.</font>

1078
01:39:13.522 --> 01:39:15.607
<font color="#707070">Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.</font>

1079
01:39:15.774 --> 01:39:17.317
<font color="#707070">Not all of them.</font>

1080
01:39:20.153 --> 01:39:21.488
<font color="#707070">Alohomora.</font>

1081
01:39:32.707 --> 01:39:34.417
<font color="#707070">Alert the Order if you can.</font>

1082
01:39:34.584 --> 01:39:38.171
<font color="#707070">~ Are you mental? We're going with you.
~ It's too dangerous.</font>

1083
01:39:38.338 --> 01:39:41.967
<font color="#707070">When are you going to get it into your head? We're in this together.</font>

1084
01:39:42.134 --> 01:39:45.345
<font color="#707070">That you are.</font>

1085
01:39:45.512 --> 01:39:48.390
<font color="#707070">Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.</font>

1086
01:39:53.395 --> 01:39:55.522
<font color="#707070">You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?</font>

1087
01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:57.692
<font color="#707070">~ No.
~ Liar.</font>

1088
01:39:57.859 --> 01:40:00.695
<font color="#707070">~ You sent for me, headmistress?
~ Snape, yes.</font>

1089
01:40:00.862 --> 01:40:04.365
<font color="#707070">The time has come for answers, whether he wants to give them to me 
or not.</font>

1090
01:40:04.782 --> 01:40:06.325
<font color="#707070">Have you brought the Veritaserum?</font>

1091
01:40:06.492 --> 01:40:09.370
<font color="#707070">I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.</font>

1092
01:40:09.537 --> 01:40:12.707
<font color="#707070">The last of it on Miss Chang.</font>

1093
01:40:16.752 --> 01:40:18.212
<font color="#707070">Unless you wish to poison him....</font>

1094
01:40:18.379 --> 01:40:22.842
<font color="#707070">And I assure you, I would have the greatest sympathy if you did.</font>

1095
01:40:23.426 --> 01:40:25.386
<font color="#707070">I cannot help you.</font>

1096
01:40:27.805 --> 01:40:29.515
<font color="#707070">He's got Padfoot.</font>

1097
01:40:30.558 --> 01:40:34.061
<font color="#707070">He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden.</font>

1098
01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:36.647
<font color="#707070">Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?</font>

1099
01:40:36.814 --> 01:40:38.357
<font color="#707070">What is he talking about, Snape?</font>

1100
01:40:45.031 --> 01:40:47.033
<font color="#707070">No idea.</font>

1101
01:40:51.537 --> 01:40:53.080
<font color="#707070">Very well.</font>

1102
01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:56.417
<font color="#707070">You give me no choice, Potter.</font>

1103
01:40:56.793 --> 01:40:59.754
<font color="#707070">As this is an issue
of Ministry security....</font>

1104
01:40:59.921 --> 01:41:02.006
<font color="#707070">....you leave me with....</font>

1105
01:41:02.757 --> 01:41:04.717
<font color="#707070">....no alternative.</font>

1106
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:07.720
<font color="#707070">The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.</font>

1107
01:41:07.887 --> 01:41:08.888
<font color="#707070">That's illegal.</font>

1108
01:41:09.096 --> 01:41:12.433
<font color="#707070">What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.</font>

1109
01:41:19.941 --> 01:41:21.442
<font color="#707070">Tell her, Harry!</font>

1110
01:41:22.944 --> 01:41:24.403
<font color="#707070">Tell me what?</font>

1111
01:41:25.613 --> 01:41:27.615
<font color="#707070">Well, if you won't tell her where it is....</font>

1112
01:41:28.282 --> 01:41:30.034
<font color="#707070">....I will.</font>

1113
01:41:31.661 --> 01:41:33.454
<font color="#707070">Where what is?</font>

1114
01:41:34.664 --> 01:41:36.958
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore's secret weapon.</font>

1115
01:41:41.963 --> 01:41:43.506
<font color="#707070">How much further?</font>

1116
01:41:43.673 --> 01:41:45.341
<font color="#707070">Not far.</font>

1117
01:41:47.343 --> 01:41:51.013
<font color="#707070">It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.</font>

1118
01:41:55.393 --> 01:41:56.853
<font color="#707070">What are you doing?</font>

1119
01:41:57.019 --> 01:41:58.813
<font color="#707070">Improvising.</font>

1120
01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:08.948
<font color="#707070">Well?</font>

1121
01:42:10.241 --> 01:42:12.368
<font color="#707070">Where is this weapon?</font>

1122
01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:19.542
<font color="#707070">There isn't one, is there?</font>

1123
01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:24.505
<font color="#707070">You were trying to trick me.</font>

1124
01:42:28.676 --> 01:42:30.261
<font color="#707070">You know....</font>

1125
01:42:31.679 --> 01:42:33.681
<font color="#707070">....I really hate children.</font>

1126
01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:53.701
<font color="#707070">You have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter.</font>

1127
01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:58.039
<font color="#707070">Lower your weapons.</font>

1128
01:42:58.206 --> 01:43:03.753
<font color="#707070">I warn you, under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence....</font>

1129
01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:05.171
<font color="#707070">Protego.</font>

1130
01:43:05.421 --> 01:43:06.506
<font color="#707070">How dare you?</font>

1131
01:43:07.215 --> 01:43:08.716
<font color="#707070">Filthy half-breed.</font>

1132
01:43:09.467 --> 01:43:10.510
<font color="#707070">Incarcerous.</font>

1133
01:43:23.731 --> 01:43:26.275
<font color="#707070">Please. Please stop it. Please.</font>

1134
01:43:26.484 --> 01:43:31.155
<font color="#707070">Now, enough. I will have order.</font>

1135
01:43:39.997 --> 01:43:42.542
<font color="#707070">You filthy animal.</font>

1136
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:45.711
<font color="#707070">Do you know who I am?</font>

1137
01:43:45.878 --> 01:43:48.714
<font color="#707070">Leave him alone. It's not his fault.</font>

1138
01:43:48.881 --> 01:43:50.758
<font color="#707070">No, he doesn't understand.</font>

1139
01:43:58.433 --> 01:44:01.894
<font color="#707070">Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.</font>

1140
01:44:02.061 --> 01:44:03.980
<font color="#707070">I'm sorry, professor.</font>

1141
01:44:04.147 --> 01:44:05.940
<font color="#707070">But I must not tell lies.</font>

1142
01:44:06.107 --> 01:44:07.150
<font color="#707070">What are you doing?</font>

1143
01:44:07.316 --> 01:44:11.070
<font color="#707070">I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge.</font>

1144
01:44:11.612 --> 01:44:13.781
<font color="#707070">Let me go!</font>

1145
01:44:16.451 --> 01:44:18.286
<font color="#707070">Thank you, Grawp.</font>

1146
01:44:18.453 --> 01:44:21.956
<font color="#707070">Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.</font>

1147
01:44:30.214 --> 01:44:33.801
<font color="#707070">~ How'd you get away?
~ Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.</font>

1148
01:44:33.968 --> 01:44:36.095
<font color="#707070">Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.</font>

1149
01:44:36.262 --> 01:44:38.806
<font color="#707070">They told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves.</font>

1150
01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.142
<font color="#707070">That was clever, Ron.</font>

1151
01:44:41.976 --> 01:44:44.437
<font color="#707070">~ Has been known to happen.
~ It was brilliant.</font>

1152
01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:46.481
<font color="#707070">So how are we getting to London?</font>

1153
01:44:47.815 --> 01:44:51.360
<font color="#707070">Look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you....</font>

1154
01:44:52.195 --> 01:44:54.906
<font color="#707070">....but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.</font>

1155
01:44:55.072 --> 01:44:58.034
<font color="#707070">Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be about doing something real.</font>

1156
01:44:58.367 --> 01:45:00.495
<font color="#707070">Or was that all just words to you?</font>

1157
01:45:02.372 --> 01:45:05.584
<font color="#707070">Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate.</font>

1158
01:45:10.506 --> 01:45:12.633
<font color="#707070">So how are we going to get to London?</font>

1159
01:45:14.051 --> 01:45:16.303
<font color="#707070">We fly, of course.</font>

1160
01:46:07.354 --> 01:46:09.523
<font color="#707070">Department of Mysteries.</font>

1161
01:46:18.365 --> 01:46:20.075
<font color="#707070">This is it.</font>

1162
01:47:13.045 --> 01:47:15.339
<font color="#707070">Ninety-two. Ninety-three.</font>

1163
01:47:17.090 --> 01:47:18.467
<font color="#707070">Ninety-four.</font>

1164
01:47:19.718 --> 01:47:20.719
<font color="#707070">Ninety-five.</font>

1165
01:47:33.315 --> 01:47:36.068
<font color="#707070">~ He should be here.
~ Harry.</font>

1166
01:47:38.779 --> 01:47:40.030
<font color="#707070">It's got your name on it.</font>

1167
01:48:05.264 --> 01:48:09.643
<font color="#707070">The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.</font>

1168
01:48:10.477 --> 01:48:12.855
<font color="#707070">And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal....</font>

1169
01:48:13.063 --> 01:48:15.858
<font color="#707070">....but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.</font>

1170
01:48:21.530 --> 01:48:26.869
<font color="#707070">For neither can live
while the other survives.</font>

1171
01:48:29.371 --> 01:48:30.456
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

1172
01:48:40.966 --> 01:48:42.468
<font color="#707070">Where's Sirius?</font>

1173
01:48:42.634 --> 01:48:47.681
<font color="#707070">You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams....</font>

1174
01:48:50.642 --> 01:48:52.770
<font color="#707070">....and reality.</font>

1175
01:48:54.062 --> 01:48:59.026
<font color="#707070">You saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see.</font>

1176
01:48:59.735 --> 01:49:01.236
<font color="#707070">Now, hand me the prophecy.</font>

1177
01:49:01.403 --> 01:49:03.489
<font color="#707070">If you do anything to us, I'll break it.</font>

1178
01:49:06.241 --> 01:49:08.786
<font color="#707070">He knows how to play.</font>

1179
01:49:08.994 --> 01:49:12.748
<font color="#707070">Itty, bitty baby.</font>

1180
01:49:12.956 --> 01:49:14.208
<font color="#707070">Potter.</font>

1181
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:16.627
<font color="#707070">Bellatrix Lestrange.</font>

1182
01:49:16.794 --> 01:49:19.755
<font color="#707070">Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?</font>

1183
01:49:19.922 --> 01:49:21.757
<font color="#707070">Better, now they're
about to be avenged.</font>

1184
01:49:24.593 --> 01:49:29.389
<font color="#707070">Now, let's everybody
just calm down....</font>

1185
01:49:29.890 --> 01:49:31.391
<font color="#707070">....shall we?</font>

1186
01:49:31.558 --> 01:49:34.019
<font color="#707070">All we want is that prophecy.</font>

1187
01:49:34.186 --> 01:49:36.396
<font color="#707070">Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?</font>

1188
01:49:36.563 --> 01:49:38.190
<font color="#707070">You dare speak his name?</font>

1189
01:49:39.733 --> 01:49:41.318
<font color="#707070">You filthy half-blood!</font>

1190
01:49:41.485 --> 01:49:44.113
<font color="#707070">It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?</font>

1191
01:49:46.031 --> 01:49:51.495
<font color="#707070">Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made.</font>

1192
01:49:51.662 --> 01:49:54.414
<font color="#707070">Which is lucky for you, really.</font>

1193
01:49:58.168 --> 01:50:00.129
<font color="#707070">Haven't you always wondered....</font>

1194
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:05.759
<font color="#707070">....the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord?</font>

1195
01:50:06.553 --> 01:50:09.013
<font color="#707070">Why he was unable to kill you....</font>

1196
01:50:09.222 --> 01:50:11.766
<font color="#707070">....when you were just an infant?</font>

1197
01:50:13.143 --> 01:50:17.939
<font color="#707070">Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?</font>

1198
01:50:18.857 --> 01:50:23.278
<font color="#707070">All the answers are there, Potter, in your hand.</font>

1199
01:50:24.487 --> 01:50:26.489
<font color="#707070">All you have to do....</font>

1200
01:50:27.031 --> 01:50:28.992
<font color="#707070">....is give it to me.</font>

1201
01:50:29.284 --> 01:50:32.579
<font color="#707070">Then I can show you everything.</font>

1202
01:50:41.337 --> 01:50:43.131
<font color="#707070">I've waited 14 years.</font>

1203
01:50:43.715 --> 01:50:44.966
<font color="#707070">I know.</font>

1204
01:50:46.342 --> 01:50:49.262
<font color="#707070">I guess I can wait a little longer. Now. Stupefy.</font>

1205
01:50:49.429 --> 01:50:50.847
<font color="#707070">Stupefy.</font>

1206
01:51:06.988 --> 01:51:07.989
<font color="#707070">Levicorpus.</font>

1207
01:51:14.537 --> 01:51:16.581
<font color="#707070">Petrificus Totalus.</font>

1208
01:51:16.748 --> 01:51:18.541
<font color="#707070">Well done, Neville.</font>

1209
01:51:27.008 --> 01:51:28.551
<font color="#707070">Stupefy.</font>

1210
01:51:30.303 --> 01:51:31.554
<font color="#707070">~ Stupefy.
~ Stupefy.</font>

1211
01:51:42.690 --> 01:51:44.567
<font color="#707070">Stupefy.</font>

1212
01:51:52.117 --> 01:51:54.410
<font color="#707070">Reducto.</font>

1213
01:52:10.426 --> 01:52:12.554
<font color="#707070">Get back to the door.</font>

1214
01:52:47.839 --> 01:52:52.343
<font color="#707070">Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?</font>

1215
01:52:57.557 --> 01:52:59.476
<font color="#707070">The voices.</font>

1216
01:53:00.018 --> 01:53:02.061
<font color="#707070">Can you tell what they're saying?</font>

1217
01:53:03.730 --> 01:53:05.857
<font color="#707070">There aren't any voices, Harry.</font>

1218
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:08.401
<font color="#707070">Let's get out of here.</font>

1219
01:53:08.568 --> 01:53:10.153
<font color="#707070">I hear them too.</font>

1220
01:53:13.281 --> 01:53:15.909
<font color="#707070">Harry, it's just an empty archway.</font>

1221
01:53:18.661 --> 01:53:20.079
<font color="#707070">Please, Harry.</font>

1222
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:22.707
<font color="#707070">Get behind me.</font>

1223
01:54:09.254 --> 01:54:11.965
<font color="#707070">Did you actually believe....</font>

1224
01:54:12.132 --> 01:54:16.719
<font color="#707070">....or were you truly naive enough to think....</font>

1225
01:54:17.345 --> 01:54:22.475
<font color="#707070">....that children stood a chance against us?</font>

1226
01:54:25.979 --> 01:54:29.732
<font color="#707070">I'll make this simple for you, Potter.</font>

1227
01:54:33.403 --> 01:54:36.739
<font color="#707070">Give me the prophecy now....</font>

1228
01:54:36.906 --> 01:54:40.910
<font color="#707070">....or watch your friends die.</font>

1229
01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:55.258
<font color="#707070">Don't give it to him, Harry.</font>

1230
01:55:21.535 --> 01:55:24.288
<font color="#707070">Get away from my godson.</font>

1231
01:55:54.401 --> 01:55:56.946
<font color="#707070">Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.</font>

1232
01:55:57.321 --> 01:55:59.156
<font color="#707070">What? No, I'm staying with you.</font>

1233
01:55:59.323 --> 01:56:02.159
<font color="#707070">You've done beautifully.</font>

1234
01:56:02.827 --> 01:56:04.453
<font color="#707070">Now, let me take it from here.</font>

1235
01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:05.621
<font color="#707070">Black.</font>

1236
01:56:32.815 --> 01:56:34.150
<font color="#707070">Expelliarmus!</font>

1237
01:56:34.316 --> 01:56:35.651
<font color="#707070">Nice one, James.</font>

1238
01:56:42.867 --> 01:56:44.368
<font color="#707070">Avada Kedavra.</font>

1239
01:57:04.555 --> 01:57:06.849
<font color="#707070">No. No.</font>

1240
01:57:30.915 --> 01:57:33.459
<font color="#707070">I killed Sirius Black.</font>

1241
01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:36.420
<font color="#707070">~ You coming to get me?
~ Crucio.</font>

1242
01:57:48.766 --> 01:57:51.936
<font color="#707070">You've got to mean it, Harry.</font>

1243
01:57:52.103 --> 01:57:55.856
<font color="#707070">She killed him. She deserves it.</font>

1244
01:57:59.693 --> 01:58:02.905
<font color="#707070">You know the spell, Harry.</font>

1245
01:58:14.458 --> 01:58:16.085
<font color="#707070">Do it.</font>

1246
01:58:23.759 --> 01:58:26.720
<font color="#707070">So weak.</font>

1247
01:58:33.477 --> 01:58:36.689
<font color="#707070">It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.</font>

1248
01:58:36.856 --> 01:58:38.607
<font color="#707070">The Aurors are on their way.</font>

1249
01:58:38.774 --> 01:58:42.987
<font color="#707070">By which time I shall be gone, and you....</font>

1250
01:58:44.488 --> 01:58:46.615
<font color="#707070">....shall be dead.</font>

1251
02:01:00.917 --> 02:01:02.794
<font color="#707070">You've lost, old man.</font>

1252
02:01:22.939 --> 02:01:23.940
<font color="#707070">Harry.</font>

1253
02:01:28.111 --> 02:01:29.613
<font color="#707070">So weak.</font>

1254
02:01:30.113 --> 02:01:32.324
<font color="#707070">So vulnerable.</font>

1255
02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:37.621
<font color="#707070">Look at me.</font>

1256
02:01:40.165 --> 02:01:44.419
<font color="#707070">Harry, it isn't how you are alike.</font>

1257
02:01:44.586 --> 02:01:47.047
<font color="#707070">It's how you are not.</font>

1258
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:53.512
<font color="#707070">Harry?</font>

1259
02:02:25.919 --> 02:02:27.379
<font color="#707070">You're the weak one....</font>

1260
02:02:28.004 --> 02:02:32.134
<font color="#707070">....and you'll never know
love or friendship.</font>

1261
02:02:35.554 --> 02:02:38.432
<font color="#707070">And I feel sorry for you.</font>

1262
02:03:01.496 --> 02:03:04.958
<font color="#707070">You're a fool, Harry Potter.</font>

1263
02:03:05.917 --> 02:03:11.047
<font color="#707070">And you will lose everything.</font>

1264
02:03:25.979 --> 02:03:27.647
<font color="#707070">He's back.</font>

1265
02:04:35.382 --> 02:04:37.050
<font color="#707070">I know how you feel, Harry.</font>

1266
02:04:37.217 --> 02:04:38.844
<font color="#707070">No, you don't.</font>

1267
02:04:44.474 --> 02:04:45.851
<font color="#707070">It's my fault.</font>

1268
02:04:46.017 --> 02:04:49.312
<font color="#707070">No, the fault is mine.</font>

1269
02:04:50.313 --> 02:04:52.065
<font color="#707070">I knew it was only a matter of time....</font>

1270
02:04:52.232 --> 02:04:55.318
<font color="#707070">....before Voldemort made the connection between you.</font>

1271
02:04:56.111 --> 02:05:00.365
<font color="#707070">I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year....</font>

1272
02:05:00.532 --> 02:05:05.745
<font color="#707070">....he'd be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected.</font>

1273
02:05:08.582 --> 02:05:11.918
<font color="#707070">The prophecy said:</font>

1274
02:05:12.544 --> 02:05:16.465
<font color="#707070">"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."</font>

1275
02:05:17.841 --> 02:05:23.890
<font color="#707070">It means one of us is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.</font>

1276
02:05:25.892 --> 02:05:27.477
<font color="#707070">Yes.</font>

1277
02:05:27.935 --> 02:05:29.520
<font color="#707070">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

1278
02:05:29.687 --> 02:05:33.274
<font color="#707070">For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.</font>

1279
02:05:33.441 --> 02:05:35.902
<font color="#707070">The same reason your friends saved you.</font>

1280
02:05:36.736 --> 02:05:40.239
<font color="#707070">After all these years,
after all you've suffered....</font>

1281
02:05:40.406 --> 02:05:43.326
<font color="#707070">....I didn't want to cause you any more pain.</font>

1282
02:05:44.786 --> 02:05:46.913
<font color="#707070">I cared too much about you.</font>

1283
02:06:11.771 --> 02:06:14.065
<font color="#707070">How come you're not at the feast?</font>

1284
02:06:14.273 --> 02:06:18.820
<font color="#707070">Lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.</font>

1285
02:06:18.986 --> 02:06:19.987
<font color="#707070">That's awful.</font>

1286
02:06:20.196 --> 02:06:22.073
<font color="#707070">Oh, it's all good fun.</font>

1287
02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:25.660
<font color="#707070">But as it's the last night, I really do need them back.</font>

1288
02:06:25.868 --> 02:06:28.246
<font color="#707070">Do you want any help finding them?</font>

1289
02:06:31.124 --> 02:06:34.335
<font color="#707070">I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.</font>

1290
02:06:41.384 --> 02:06:43.469
<font color="#707070">Are you sure you don't want any help looking?</font>

1291
02:06:43.636 --> 02:06:45.304
<font color="#707070">That's all right.</font>

1292
02:06:45.471 --> 02:06:47.598
<font color="#707070">Anyway, my mum always said....</font>

1293
02:06:47.807 --> 02:06:51.644
<font color="#707070">....the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end.</font>

1294
02:06:54.897 --> 02:06:58.151
<font color="#707070">If not always in the way we expect.</font>

1295
02:06:59.652 --> 02:07:02.363
<font color="#707070">Think I'll just go have some pudding.</font>

1296
02:07:38.024 --> 02:07:40.943
<font color="#707070">I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.</font>

1297
02:07:41.110 --> 02:07:42.820
<font color="#707070">What's that?</font>

1298
02:07:43.404 --> 02:07:46.199
<font color="#707070">That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us....</font>

1299
02:07:46.365 --> 02:07:49.452
<font color="#707070">....we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.</font>

1300
02:07:49.619 --> 02:07:51.120
<font color="#707070">Yeah?</font>

1301
02:07:53.039 --> 02:07:55.333
<font color="#707070">Something worth fighting for.</font>
