1
00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:54.706
Stop! Stop it!
Just stop it!

2
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:00.374
No!

3
00:01:07.274 --> 00:01:10.441
Shoot her! Shoot her!

4
00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:12.441
Don't! Don't do it!

5
00:01:17.706 --> 00:01:20.174
Brooke!
Wake the fuck up!

6
00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:21.873
Here.

7
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:30.141
Take it.

8
00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:52.207
Grace...

9
00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:55.407
Calm down.

10
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:59.040
Stay the fuck away from us.

11
00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:00.906
Everything's alright now, OK?

12
00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.006
She lost it,
but she's fine now.

13
00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:09.307
Everything's gonna be alright,
I promise you.

14
00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:20.374
No!

15
00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:22.207
Let 'em go.

16
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.672
You're all monsters!

17
00:02:35.107 --> 00:02:37.639
You're both the fucking same.

18
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.873
What have you done?

19
00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:53.274
Alright, come on.

20
00:06:01.374 --> 00:06:07.274
Shut up.

21
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.141
Hey, come on.

22
00:06:25.307 --> 00:06:28.007
You all ready?

23
00:07:57.341 --> 00:07:59.807
Alpha Tango Charlie,

24
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.207
we have a southbound vehicle
approaching the 44 Lateral. Over.

25
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.074
Roger that, Delta Zero.

26
00:08:10.107 --> 00:08:13.840
We have an eye in the sky monitoring
the 44 Lateral in the 3-3-12.

27
00:08:13.874 --> 00:08:16.174
Hotel Zebra, we have
a northbound two-wheeler

28
00:08:16.207 --> 00:08:20.241
approaching on the 23 Parallel
in Sector 1-1-38. Please confirm.

29
00:08:20.274 --> 00:08:21.707
Roger that.

30
00:09:03.074 --> 00:09:04.940
Fuck!

31
00:09:13.773 --> 00:09:15.341
Come on, mate.

32
00:09:48.773 --> 00:09:50.174
Come on.

33
00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:54.241
Come on.
Out you get.

34
00:09:59.074 --> 00:10:00.274
Hey!

35
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.773
Open bunker door!

36
00:10:15.807 --> 00:10:18.141
Ah, Rhys!

37
00:10:19.874 --> 00:10:21.707
So...

38
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.707
what's on the menu?

39
00:10:24.474 --> 00:10:26.374
We've got a male, early 20s.

40
00:10:26.407 --> 00:10:27.940
Bit banged up.
Concussed, maybe.

41
00:10:27.974 --> 00:10:29.773
Otherwise good condition.

42
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.907
- Bring him.
- Yes, sir.

43
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.374
On your feet.

44
00:10:36.474 --> 00:10:38.241
Oh, yes.

45
00:10:38.274 --> 00:10:39.974
Fantastic.

46
00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:42.074
Excellent bone structure.

47
00:10:48.374 --> 00:10:51.707
That's one hell of
a lovely skull.

48
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.907
- Get him inside.
- Yes, sir.

49
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.207
Good work, Rhys.
Well done.

50
00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:01.874
You got him?

51
00:11:01.907 --> 00:11:03.874
Right. Right.

52
00:11:05.341 --> 00:11:06.974
Over there. Over here. Right.

53
00:11:07.007 --> 00:11:08.974
So are we any closer
to the cure?

54
00:11:09.007 --> 00:11:10.341
Yeah, of course we are.

55
00:11:16.007 --> 00:11:17.907
The hybrid's been spotted,
and the brother.

56
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.441
Where?

57
00:11:19.475 --> 00:11:21.341
Sector 8,
100 clicks to the north.

58
00:11:21.374 --> 00:11:22.907
And what about these other two?

59
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.874
Who cares?

60
00:11:24.907 --> 00:11:26.707
We want the freak.

61
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.840
The hybrid.

62
00:11:27.874 --> 00:11:29.740
We get the girl.

63
00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:32.214
You get to put a bullet in that
prick who killed your brother.

64
00:11:37.107 --> 00:11:39.707
Cramp. Yeah.

65
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.673
Guess it's time for me to...

66
00:11:41.707 --> 00:11:43.442
rehydrate.

67
00:11:43.475 --> 00:11:45.673
- Yep.
- Off you go.

68
00:11:45.707 --> 00:11:47.107
Ah, just over here.

69
00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:49.241
Good luck out there, soldier.

70
00:11:52.207 --> 00:11:53.874
Now, you bring her in alive.

71
00:11:53.907 --> 00:11:55.807
Or you don't come knocking.

72
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.773
You get me?

73
00:11:57.807 --> 00:11:59.074
Yeah.

74
00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:06.874
Pack of wankers.

75
00:12:06.907 --> 00:12:08.374
Close bunker door.

76
00:12:20.442 --> 00:12:22.074
We shouldn't have bloody left.

77
00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:24.007
She ripped
my fuckin' throat out, Maxi.

78
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.673
What the fuck
are you talking about?

79
00:12:25.707 --> 00:12:27.040
Yeah, well whose fault
was that?

80
00:12:27.074 --> 00:12:28.673
I'm not just gonna sit there

81
00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:30.217
and watch her
torture some guy to death.

82
00:12:30.241 --> 00:12:32.341
- That guy was a soldier.
- She's sick.

83
00:12:32.374 --> 00:12:34.341
And she's getting worse.

84
00:12:34.374 --> 00:12:36.174
Her and her brother.

85
00:12:37.274 --> 00:12:39.408
They've gone road crazy.

86
00:12:41.307 --> 00:12:43.740
We can't trust 'em no more.

87
00:12:45.241 --> 00:12:47.940
Uncle Benny trusted 'em.

88
00:12:47.974 --> 00:12:49.874
Uncle Benny's dead.

89
00:13:10.807 --> 00:13:12.107
Grace?

90
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.241
Fuck.

91
00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.375
Here, open your mouth.

92
00:13:30.408 --> 00:13:33.840
Here. Here, here.
Open, open!

93
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.640
You alright?

94
00:13:53.274 --> 00:13:54.773
Here.

95
00:13:56.375 --> 00:13:57.840
Let's get going.

96
00:17:04.442 --> 00:17:06.007
Hi.

97
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.242
No! No, no, no, no, no!

98
00:17:07.275 --> 00:17:09.807
Quiet!

99
00:17:48.175 --> 00:17:49.940
Access granted.

100
00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.007
Well, well, well.

101
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.108
I told you never to bring anybody
in here while I'm working.

102
00:17:58.142 --> 00:18:00.442
Turns out you were right,
Sergeant.

103
00:18:00.475 --> 00:18:03.075
Looks like our Surgeon General
here's a bite-hider.

104
00:18:03.108 --> 00:18:05.773
You fuck.

105
00:18:05.807 --> 00:18:08.075
- Unholster your weapon.
- Yes, Colonel.

106
00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:10.175
Walk over there.

107
00:18:10.208 --> 00:18:12.874
- And blow his brains out.
- Yes, sir.

108
00:18:12.907 --> 00:18:14.707
Just hang on a minute.

109
00:18:15.773 --> 00:18:17.308
Just... Just wait!

110
00:18:22.242 --> 00:18:24.840
You need to
hide your symptoms better.

111
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.075
Was that...

112
00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:30.408
...really necessary?

113
00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:33.840
You ever put me in a position
like that again...

114
00:18:33.874 --> 00:18:36.840
I'll put a bullet
through your fuckin' skull.

115
00:18:36.874 --> 00:18:39.142
Yes, but then...

116
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.840
...where would you get
your medicine from, Colonel?

117
00:18:47.807 --> 00:18:50.673
We're not going to make
our serum quota this month.

118
00:18:50.707 --> 00:18:54.242
HQ's gonna start
asking questions.

119
00:18:56.475 --> 00:18:58.108
Fuck HQ.

120
00:18:59.442 --> 00:19:01.208
And besides,

121
00:19:01.242 --> 00:19:03.375
once we get our hands on her...

122
00:19:06.773 --> 00:19:09.342
...we won't have to
worry about that anymore.

123
00:20:03.874 --> 00:20:07.408
Wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

124
00:20:23.308 --> 00:20:26.041
Jesus fucking Christ.

125
00:20:26.075 --> 00:20:27.408
You're a hybrid.

126
00:21:16.075 --> 00:21:17.840
What the fuck!

127
00:21:18.707 --> 00:21:20.673
Open bunker door!

128
00:21:22.773 --> 00:21:24.342
Fuckin' idiots.

129
00:21:38.707 --> 00:21:40.807
It's a bit late
for a barrel drop, ain't it?

130
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:42.941
It's not your concern, champ.

131
00:21:44.941 --> 00:21:48.308
Oi! Oi! I need that fuckin'
fuel for the barrel drop,

132
00:21:48.342 --> 00:21:49.908
you fuckin' idiots.

133
00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:52.142
I need you right here,
Corporal.

134
00:21:53.442 --> 00:21:54.707
Yes, sir.

135
00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.041
What's the delivery?

136
00:21:57.075 --> 00:21:59.941
Female. Early 20s.

137
00:22:01.773 --> 00:22:03.375
She's a hybrid.

138
00:22:03.408 --> 00:22:04.908
Go get her now.

139
00:22:04.941 --> 00:22:06.375
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, Colonel.

140
00:22:20.242 --> 00:22:21.975
Fuck! Christ!

141
00:22:25.375 --> 00:22:26.740
Oh, shoot her fuckin' legs out.

142
00:22:26.773 --> 00:22:29.041
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

143
00:22:29.075 --> 00:22:31.108
I can calm her down.
I can calm her down.

144
00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:33.175
Keep her still.

145
00:22:33.208 --> 00:22:34.875
Hold still, hold still.

146
00:22:34.908 --> 00:22:37.242
Here you go, hon.
Here you go, here you go.

147
00:22:37.275 --> 00:22:40.242
There you go. There you go.

148
00:22:40.275 --> 00:22:41.773
Easy.

149
00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.975
Easy.

150
00:22:44.841 --> 00:22:46.275
It's gonna be alright.

151
00:22:46.308 --> 00:22:48.008
I promise.

152
00:22:50.808 --> 00:22:53.841
- Get her inside.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:22:53.875 --> 00:22:56.275
Oh, put it down,
you fuckin' idiot.

154
00:22:56.308 --> 00:22:58.175
Oi. Oi!

155
00:23:00.342 --> 00:23:02.841
I want to know
what goes on with this one.

156
00:23:02.875 --> 00:23:06.008
If she's a key to the cure,
I want to know.

157
00:23:10.475 --> 00:23:12.175
You get in your truck.

158
00:23:12.208 --> 00:23:15.275
You drop your barrels
like a good little soldier

159
00:23:15.308 --> 00:23:17.142
and fuck off.

160
00:23:27.008 --> 00:23:28.941
Close bunker door!

161
00:23:53.142 --> 00:23:54.941
Oh, for fuck's...

162
00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:58.342
Now I've run out of
fuckin' fuel, haven't I?

163
00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:05.875
Ah, the fuck! Come on!
Come on, you fuckin'...

164
00:24:15.208 --> 00:24:17.075
Here you go. Here you go.

165
00:24:17.108 --> 00:24:19.408
There you go, mate.
Fuckin' eat!

166
00:24:19.442 --> 00:24:21.275
Nuh. Fuckin'...

167
00:24:21.308 --> 00:24:23.408
Come on, you fuckin' thing.

168
00:24:30.075 --> 00:24:32.041
Hey? Come on!

169
00:24:32.075 --> 00:24:33.408
Come on!

170
00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:38.342
Come on, where are you,
you bastards?

171
00:24:39.475 --> 00:24:40.975
Come on, come and get it!

172
00:24:41.008 --> 00:24:44.242
Get some meat!

173
00:24:49.041 --> 00:24:51.774
Come on,
ya stinkin' fuckin' animals!

174
00:24:51.808 --> 00:24:53.708
Come and get it!

175
00:25:15.808 --> 00:25:17.975
Alright. Here we go, hey?

176
00:25:18.008 --> 00:25:20.108
Come on.

177
00:25:20.142 --> 00:25:22.075
That's it. Come on, mate.

178
00:25:25.408 --> 00:25:27.674
Nah, fuck this.

179
00:25:37.041 --> 00:25:40.142
Stay still, ya fuckin' thing!
There ya go.

180
00:25:48.175 --> 00:25:50.941
Come on, come on.

181
00:25:50.975 --> 00:25:53.142
Yes!

182
00:25:54.442 --> 00:25:56.275
I'll come back for you
tomorrow, mate.

183
00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:25.808
Who goes there?

184
00:26:25.841 --> 00:26:29.242
Hey, not on me,
you fuckin' peanut.

185
00:26:29.275 --> 00:26:31.875
Jesus Christ.

186
00:26:31.908 --> 00:26:33.308
I got barrels for ya.

187
00:26:33.342 --> 00:26:36.841
Ha! Fuckin' cop that, ya cunts!

188
00:26:41.175 --> 00:26:43.075
Fuck, yeah.

189
00:26:43.108 --> 00:26:44.308
Fuckin' pussy.

190
00:26:44.342 --> 00:26:45.774
You're an idiot.

191
00:27:02.941 --> 00:27:04.142
G'day.

192
00:27:06.075 --> 00:27:08.275
Is this one for the bunker?

193
00:27:09.774 --> 00:27:12.041
That for the boys
in the bunker, is it?

194
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:17.908
Righto.
Barrels are in the back.

195
00:27:20.308 --> 00:27:22.175
Yes, sir.

196
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:44.674
Dickhead.

197
00:27:44.708 --> 00:27:46.108
Fuck.

198
00:29:26.342 --> 00:29:28.142
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

199
00:29:28.175 --> 00:29:30.041
- Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no!
- Hold still!

200
00:29:51.175 --> 00:29:52.808
Not even gonna make it.

201
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:54.641
Fuckin' hell!

202
00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:10.108
Fuck! Come on!

203
00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:20.008
Hey! Hello!

204
00:30:21.708 --> 00:30:23.275
Yes, yes, yes, look at this!

205
00:30:23.308 --> 00:30:26.108
Hey? Come on, get it!

206
00:30:26.142 --> 00:30:27.875
Fuck!

207
00:32:05.443 --> 00:32:11.674
I want you to take
a deep breath in through your nose

208
00:32:11.708 --> 00:32:16.808
and visualise
a stream of blue healing light

209
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:20.975
travelling deep
into your crown chakra.

210
00:32:24.041 --> 00:32:28.243
This energy travels down into
your whole head...

211
00:32:40.175 --> 00:32:42.674
...sacred healing...

212
00:32:50.975 --> 00:32:52.343
Oh, fuck!

213
00:33:03.176 --> 00:33:05.075
Fuck!

214
00:33:09.008 --> 00:33:11.708
Let your entire being

215
00:33:11.741 --> 00:33:14.176
be free from fear.

216
00:33:14.209 --> 00:33:18.641
And completely at peace with
the universe.

217
00:33:50.476 --> 00:33:53.376
Whoa, easy.
Easy, easy!

218
00:33:55.774 --> 00:33:58.808
This is where you tell me you're
gonna help me get my sister back.

219
00:33:58.841 --> 00:34:00.684
Or I'll put this dart through
your fuckin' head.

220
00:34:00.708 --> 00:34:02.143
Sure.

221
00:34:02.176 --> 00:34:04.041
Who's your sister?

222
00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:14.176
Me and you
are going for a drive.

223
00:34:14.209 --> 00:34:16.875
You'll have to get that wound
looked at.

224
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:21.708
If you leave that you'll get
septicaemia and you'll die.

225
00:34:21.741 --> 00:34:23.109
Yeah, right.

226
00:34:23.143 --> 00:34:24.975
And all I have to do is
cut you loose, yeah?

227
00:34:25.008 --> 00:34:26.817
Listen, I'm sure there's some
way we can work this out

228
00:34:26.841 --> 00:34:29.243
where we can both
trust each other.

229
00:34:35.708 --> 00:34:37.708
Listen, would you...

230
00:34:37.741 --> 00:34:40.774
Would you mind taking your
finger off that trigger there?

231
00:34:41.841 --> 00:34:43.741
Shut up and stitch.

232
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:48.841
I'm doing it.

233
00:34:50.875 --> 00:34:53.008
Get your hands up.

234
00:34:53.041 --> 00:34:55.376
- Hands up!
- They're up.

235
00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:58.209
Fuckin' hell. God.

236
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:06.109
Start the engine.

237
00:35:09.409 --> 00:35:11.109
Stop.

238
00:35:30.176 --> 00:35:32.975
OK, off we go.

239
00:35:33.009 --> 00:35:34.875
We have to open the gate.

240
00:35:34.908 --> 00:35:36.309
Smash through it.

241
00:35:36.343 --> 00:35:38.076
We'll bounce straight off

242
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:40.176
and you're gonna smash
your face on the dashboard.

243
00:35:40.209 --> 00:35:41.941
Nah, that's bullshit.

244
00:35:41.975 --> 00:35:44.109
You just don't want to mess up
your nice little gate.

245
00:35:44.143 --> 00:35:45.875
It's your call.

246
00:35:45.908 --> 00:35:47.343
Do it.

247
00:36:09.941 --> 00:36:11.708
Nice truck.

248
00:36:15.708 --> 00:36:17.875
Not talking to me, huh?

249
00:36:17.908 --> 00:36:19.376
Suit yourself.

250
00:36:25.176 --> 00:36:27.143
What's that?

251
00:36:27.176 --> 00:36:28.741
What does it look like?

252
00:36:28.774 --> 00:36:30.076
They're pills.

253
00:36:30.941 --> 00:36:32.875
Anti-viral pills.

254
00:36:32.908 --> 00:36:35.176
It's how I stay alive up here.

255
00:36:40.774 --> 00:36:42.309
Why have you got this?

256
00:36:42.343 --> 00:36:45.875
'Cause they're terrorists.
They're killers.

257
00:36:48.908 --> 00:36:50.143
Ain't that what you do?

258
00:36:50.176 --> 00:36:52.376
No, that's not what I do.

259
00:36:52.409 --> 00:36:53.976
I've seen the bodies.

260
00:36:54.009 --> 00:36:57.343
You kidnap people
and you kill 'em!

261
00:36:57.376 --> 00:37:00.209
We don't kill anybody.

262
00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:22.774
- You got a package for us?
- Yeah.

263
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:28.741
It's the hybrid girl's sister.

264
00:39:28.775 --> 00:39:30.309
No shit.

265
00:39:30.343 --> 00:39:32.809
You've been a busy boy, Rhys.

266
00:39:33.775 --> 00:39:36.409
Well played, mate.

267
00:39:36.443 --> 00:39:38.809
- Go and get her.
- Yes, sir.

268
00:39:44.741 --> 00:39:46.708
Fuck! Fuckin'...

269
00:39:50.243 --> 00:39:52.775
Hey! Hey take it easy, mate.
She's a fuckin' kid.

270
00:39:52.809 --> 00:39:55.376
Either way, this little prick's
gonna end up in a fuckin' barrel.

271
00:39:55.409 --> 00:39:57.741
What'd you say, mate?

272
00:39:57.775 --> 00:40:00.152
"Either way, she ends up in a barrel"?
What the fuck does that mean?

273
00:40:00.176 --> 00:40:03.674
It means get in your vehicle
and drive away, Corporal.

274
00:40:06.742 --> 00:40:08.243
Get in your vehicle.

275
00:40:08.276 --> 00:40:10.343
Drive away.

276
00:40:13.042 --> 00:40:14.309
Righto.

277
00:40:29.009 --> 00:40:31.409
What the fuck just happened?

278
00:40:35.243 --> 00:40:37.042
Get in the truck.

279
00:40:56.076 --> 00:40:58.209
Fuck!

280
00:41:12.076 --> 00:41:13.976
Shit. Shit!

281
00:41:27.376 --> 00:41:29.209
- Shit!
- Nitro activated.

282
00:41:29.243 --> 00:41:31.042
Fuck's sakes.

283
00:41:41.143 --> 00:41:44.642
- Power priming.
- Come on! Prime! Fuckin' prime!

284
00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:05.243
Methane low.
Replace power source.

285
00:42:07.876 --> 00:42:10.642
Don't worry.
They don't have nitro.

286
00:42:14.742 --> 00:42:16.409
You sure about that?

287
00:42:18.842 --> 00:42:20.976
Fuckin' shit!!

288
00:42:34.443 --> 00:42:36.909
Wakey-wakey!

289
00:42:36.942 --> 00:42:39.009
Fuckin' get the dog!

290
00:42:41.343 --> 00:42:44.009
- Got the nuts!
- Bullseye!

291
00:42:44.042 --> 00:42:48.243
How's that feel, slugger?

292
00:42:48.276 --> 00:42:50.976
Doesn't feel too good,
does it, hey?

293
00:42:51.009 --> 00:42:52.876
Fuckin' hurts.

294
00:42:54.443 --> 00:42:57.642
See, traitors get the death
penalty around here, Corporal.

295
00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:01.042
I reckon...

296
00:43:01.076 --> 00:43:02.909
any man

297
00:43:02.942 --> 00:43:05.876
who kicks another man
in the balls when he's down...

298
00:43:07.009 --> 00:43:09.076
...don't deserve
a soldier's death.

299
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:13.009
See, your brother,
he died with dignity.

300
00:43:13.042 --> 00:43:14.309
Honour.

301
00:43:14.343 --> 00:43:16.309
Like a real man.

302
00:43:23.176 --> 00:43:26.909
But you're not a real man,
are ya, hey?

303
00:43:26.942 --> 00:43:29.209
You're a dog.

304
00:43:29.243 --> 00:43:31.775
You're a lowdown, dirty dog.

305
00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:34.775
And you're gonna die
like a fuckin' dog.

306
00:43:35.909 --> 00:43:39.042
You see these old boys,
creeping up?

307
00:43:44.143 --> 00:43:46.243
They'll be here
in a couple of minutes.

308
00:43:46.276 --> 00:43:49.276
And when they get here, they're
gonna eat you from the feet up.

309
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:52.009
First your feet.

310
00:43:52.042 --> 00:43:53.876
Then your legs.

311
00:43:53.909 --> 00:43:55.409
Your balls.

312
00:43:55.443 --> 00:43:57.209
In that order.

313
00:43:59.976 --> 00:44:01.909
Big tough guy like you.

314
00:44:01.942 --> 00:44:04.775
You could still be alive
when they get to your guts.

315
00:44:08.376 --> 00:44:10.276
You have a good one now, eh?

316
00:46:19.876 --> 00:46:21.775
Well, well, well.

317
00:46:21.809 --> 00:46:24.842
Look what
the cat's dragged in, eh?

318
00:46:34.042 --> 00:46:35.842
Unless I'm mistaken

319
00:46:35.876 --> 00:46:38.842
didn't we take care of
this piece of shit already?

320
00:46:39.942 --> 00:46:42.009
That was my brother.

321
00:46:42.042 --> 00:46:43.742
Your brother?

322
00:46:43.775 --> 00:46:46.209
So twins?

323
00:46:46.243 --> 00:46:48.742
Your brother, eh?

324
00:46:49.976 --> 00:46:52.377
He was a fuckwit

325
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.309
who got exactly
what he deserved.

326
00:46:57.976 --> 00:46:59.675
I'm gonna kill ya.

327
00:46:59.709 --> 00:47:01.410
Nah, mate.

328
00:47:01.444 --> 00:47:04.842
No, the only thing you're gonna
do is sit there and bleed

329
00:47:04.876 --> 00:47:06.709
until I fuckin' say so!

330
00:47:08.243 --> 00:47:10.444
You were the one that
crashed their rig on the road.

331
00:47:10.477 --> 00:47:13.976
You gave Gracie to those
butchers in the bunker.

332
00:47:22.276 --> 00:47:24.209
Then again...

333
00:47:24.243 --> 00:47:28.176
Maxi also tells me
you saved her life.

334
00:47:29.076 --> 00:47:31.076
Still, I don't know.

335
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:34.909
There's just
something about ya.

336
00:47:41.076 --> 00:47:42.444
His face.

337
00:47:42.477 --> 00:47:45.209
I hate this face!

338
00:47:45.243 --> 00:47:47.277
That's it. The face.

339
00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:49.909
The face is a real problem.

340
00:47:49.942 --> 00:47:53.675
I just wanna rip it off
and eat the fuckin' thing.

341
00:47:53.709 --> 00:47:55.377
What do you think, Maxi?

342
00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:57.042
Is this guy a friend

343
00:47:57.076 --> 00:47:58.942
or is he dog food?

344
00:48:01.976 --> 00:48:03.775
Dog food.

345
00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:09.444
What do you say, soldier boy?

346
00:48:09.477 --> 00:48:11.277
You our friend

347
00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:13.742
or do I bite your face off?

348
00:48:13.775 --> 00:48:15.444
I'm a friend, yeah.

349
00:48:15.477 --> 00:48:17.209
Definitely the friend.

350
00:49:15.477 --> 00:49:17.742
How many men in there?

351
00:49:17.775 --> 00:49:19.909
Five.

352
00:49:19.942 --> 00:49:21.410
Two out front

353
00:49:21.444 --> 00:49:23.244
and two with guns and a medic.

354
00:49:23.277 --> 00:49:25.942
- And their hardware?
- Just the usual.

355
00:49:25.976 --> 00:49:29.675
Steyrs, shotguns,
Glocks, grenades.

356
00:49:29.709 --> 00:49:32.444
If we get the drop on them,
none of that'll matter.

357
00:49:32.477 --> 00:49:33.909
We'll take 'em.

358
00:49:35.042 --> 00:49:36.842
Oi.

359
00:49:36.876 --> 00:49:40.310
You cut me loose,
I can guarantee that.

360
00:49:46.809 --> 00:49:48.344
Bit of a nasty cough.

361
00:49:48.377 --> 00:49:49.909
You a bit crook, are ya?

362
00:49:50.909 --> 00:49:52.876
Looking for these?

363
00:49:55.344 --> 00:49:56.876
What's in 'em?

364
00:49:56.909 --> 00:49:58.377
I don't fuckin' know.

365
00:50:01.709 --> 00:50:03.277
Give 'em to him.

366
00:50:09.842 --> 00:50:11.344
Ah, fuck it.

367
00:50:14.076 --> 00:50:15.876
Oh, you fuck!

368
00:50:22.809 --> 00:50:24.775
How can you do it?

369
00:50:29.244 --> 00:50:30.809
I didn't know.

370
00:50:30.842 --> 00:50:32.410
What do you mean,
you didn't know?

371
00:50:32.444 --> 00:50:34.742
I didn't know
they were killing them. I...

372
00:50:34.775 --> 00:50:38.144
- Bullshit.
- You think I give a fuck what you think, love?

373
00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:43.110
- Brooke...
- You knew!

374
00:50:59.809 --> 00:51:01.642
You all good?

375
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:06.177
You reckon
you can get us in there?

376
00:51:07.244 --> 00:51:08.809
Easy.

377
00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:13.675
What the...?

378
00:51:31.277 --> 00:51:33.675
- Intruders!
- We're under attack!

379
00:51:33.709 --> 00:51:35.876
- We've been surrounded!
- Get down!

380
00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:31.144
Friend of yours?

381
00:52:31.177 --> 00:52:33.742
I picked him up
a couple of days ago.

382
00:52:33.775 --> 00:52:35.742
Not far from here.

383
00:52:45.277 --> 00:52:47.144
Now you know.

384
00:53:14.477 --> 00:53:17.244
What do you do with them?

385
00:53:17.277 --> 00:53:19.110
Down in the bunkers?

386
00:53:20.244 --> 00:53:22.377
We grow a curative serum
inside them

387
00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:23.977
and then extract it.

388
00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:26.144
And this serum.
It cures people?

389
00:53:26.177 --> 00:53:29.210
Not cures. Manages.
It's preventative.

390
00:53:29.244 --> 00:53:31.344
Keeps the virus
from taking hold.

391
00:53:31.377 --> 00:53:34.742
Listen, I have medical supplies
that could last you a year.

392
00:53:34.775 --> 00:53:36.742
Hundreds of rounds
of ammunition.

393
00:53:36.775 --> 00:53:40.144
Explosives. Grenades, mate.
Whatever you want.

394
00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:43.177
Why the barrels?

395
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.642
You should know.

396
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:52.144
We grind 'em up

397
00:53:52.177 --> 00:53:54.742
then convert them
to powder form.

398
00:53:54.775 --> 00:53:56.775
Pills.

399
00:53:56.809 --> 00:53:58.943
We make pills.

400
00:54:30.444 --> 00:54:31.742
Oi!

401
00:54:34.775 --> 00:54:37.943
Move and I'll
blow his fuckin' head off!

402
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:42.910
These...

403
00:54:42.943 --> 00:54:44.410
fucks...

404
00:54:46.277 --> 00:54:48.809
...they took my soul.

405
00:54:50.043 --> 00:54:52.344
And so I am gonna go down

406
00:54:52.377 --> 00:54:55.742
into that bunker with you

407
00:54:55.775 --> 00:54:59.742
and we're gonna kill every last
one of those sons-of-bitches.

408
00:55:02.977 --> 00:55:04.910
I gotta make this right.

409
00:55:11.977 --> 00:55:13.910
Fuckin' A.

410
00:55:39.477 --> 00:55:41.977
Colonel. You OK?

411
00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:43.810
I'm fine.

412
00:55:43.843 --> 00:55:45.410
You fine?

413
00:55:45.444 --> 00:55:47.943
Go and check the perimeter!

414
00:55:53.077 --> 00:55:54.943
Access granted.

415
00:56:02.877 --> 00:56:05.843
Ah, Colonel!
Care for a toot?

416
00:56:06.843 --> 00:56:09.377
No? No, no. Wait!

417
00:56:10.943 --> 00:56:12.810
It's not that simple.

418
00:56:12.843 --> 00:56:15.277
You just can't suck it out of
her like we do with the others.

419
00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:18.010
That would be like
injecting rocket fuel.

420
00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:23.742
We have a situation upstairs,
Colonel.

421
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:28.943
Well, fuck me.

422
00:56:34.144 --> 00:56:35.943
It's taking too long.

423
00:56:35.977 --> 00:56:37.410
Something's wrong.

424
00:56:37.444 --> 00:56:39.344
No way. Give it time.

425
00:56:43.477 --> 00:56:46.144
Here we go.
Come on!

426
00:56:57.977 --> 00:56:59.709
Alright, here we go.

427
00:57:06.077 --> 00:57:09.144
- Come on, get ready. Another one down.
- Suppress your fire!

428
00:58:10.877 --> 00:58:12.977
Shit. Shit!

429
00:58:22.177 --> 00:58:24.277
Rhys.

430
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:38.010
Go! Go, go, go, go!

431
00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:02.277
Lima Papa Zulu,
we have a 187 on the 22.

432
01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.310
Requesting a link-up, over.

433
01:00:08.943 --> 01:00:11.843
Victor Kilo India, we have a
trapped RV in the 93 Parallel.

434
01:00:11.877 --> 01:00:13.843
Requesting immediate choppers.

435
01:00:38.043 --> 01:00:40.810
You take her. I got the brother
and the delivery boy.

436
01:00:40.843 --> 01:00:42.810
Yeah. Yeah, agreed.

437
01:00:42.843 --> 01:00:45.043
You start on her
before I get back...

438
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.810
...I'll fuckin' kill ya.

439
01:00:48.843 --> 01:00:51.810
Oh, yeah?
Like you killed Rhys?

440
01:00:51.843 --> 01:00:56.377
Well, forgive me if I'm
not trembling in my booties.

441
01:01:10.776 --> 01:01:12.743
Whoa, what the fuck
is this shit?

442
01:01:12.776 --> 01:01:14.177
Don't worry.

443
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:17.410
It's a cleansing agent.
It kills the virus.

444
01:01:17.444 --> 01:01:19.277
What's it made out of?

445
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:27.877
Stay quiet.
They're coming down now.

446
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:07.177
She's alive.

447
01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:08.810
Get that door open.

448
01:02:14.043 --> 01:02:16.110
Fuck! Ow!

449
01:02:16.144 --> 01:02:19.277
- What the fuck was that?
- Sorry.

450
01:02:22.843 --> 01:02:24.843
Oh, fuck me.

451
01:02:44.445 --> 01:02:46.177
Access denied.

452
01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:23.776
OK.

453
01:03:43.277 --> 01:03:45.077
G'day, boys.

454
01:03:54.378 --> 01:03:57.244
Drop 'em.

455
01:03:57.277 --> 01:03:59.710
Or I'll blow
her fuckin' head off.

456
01:04:03.843 --> 01:04:05.710
All of 'em.

457
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:10.943
Now kick 'em over.

458
01:04:14.378 --> 01:04:16.378
Good lads.

459
01:04:16.411 --> 01:04:18.110
Hey!

460
01:04:18.144 --> 01:04:19.743
Weak fuckin'... Ohh!

461
01:04:19.776 --> 01:04:22.277
This the prick
who killed your brother?

462
01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:27.010
Thought so.

463
01:04:30.478 --> 01:04:32.710
Now, you see,

464
01:04:32.743 --> 01:04:35.776
if some dirty bastard
killed my brother,

465
01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:40.043
I'd make sure I'd do him
nice and slow.

466
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:58.378
Hello, toots!

467
01:04:58.411 --> 01:05:01.144
Would you mind
if I cracked open your skull

468
01:05:01.177 --> 01:05:03.776
and feasted
on the juice inside?

469
01:05:45.144 --> 01:05:48.643
What are you up to, big guy?

470
01:05:55.977 --> 01:05:59.177
Don't you know that a bloke with
his guts hanging on the outside

471
01:05:59.211 --> 01:06:02.810
should have enough sense
to fuckin' die!

472
01:08:49.145 --> 01:08:52.311
Emergency power activated.

473
01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.743
1138, we just came from
Pill Factory 5B

474
01:09:09.776 --> 01:09:12.676
and it's a fuckin'
slaughterhouse over there.

475
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:15.710
Did you guys have any trouble
in your sector today?

476
01:09:15.743 --> 01:09:18.843
Get your arses
up here now!

477
01:09:21.877 --> 01:09:23.776
Don't worry about me.

478
01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:27.643
We need to get that door open.

479
01:09:36.345 --> 01:09:38.011
Brooke, you OK?

480
01:09:40.178 --> 01:09:41.311
Brooke?

481
01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:48.245
Brooke?

482
01:09:48.278 --> 01:09:50.145
Oh, shit, that's not good.

483
01:09:55.478 --> 01:09:56.943
Wait, don't shoot her.

484
01:09:56.978 --> 01:09:58.710
What the fuck do I do, then?

485
01:09:58.743 --> 01:10:00.178
Get in! Quick!

486
01:10:01.445 --> 01:10:03.776
Quick! Quick!

487
01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:04.978
Fucking hell.

488
01:10:13.111 --> 01:10:14.877
That cage door's
not gonna hold!

489
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:16.710
Give me a blood vial now.

490
01:10:18.378 --> 01:10:20.245
- Shit.
- Come on!

491
01:10:20.278 --> 01:10:23.178
Shit.
They're cracked.

492
01:10:23.211 --> 01:10:25.211
- All of 'em!
- Oh, for...

493
01:10:25.245 --> 01:10:26.877
Fuck!

494
01:10:28.378 --> 01:10:30.743
So it's just blood
that calms her down, right?

495
01:10:30.776 --> 01:10:32.111
That's right.

496
01:10:39.843 --> 01:10:41.411
I think I have an idea.

497
01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:43.345
Yeah, 'course you do.

498
01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:50.245
Go!

499
01:11:47.178 --> 01:11:50.044
Get your sister out of here.

500
01:12:07.345 --> 01:12:09.211
It's OK.

501
01:12:11.078 --> 01:12:12.878
Help me up.

502
01:12:25.811 --> 01:12:27.378
Fuck.

503
01:12:32.111 --> 01:12:34.178
Get back!

504
01:12:43.145 --> 01:12:44.710
You right?

505
01:12:46.211 --> 01:12:47.878

Get in. Now!

518
01:13:44.844 --> 01:13:46.011
- Come on.
- No!

519
01:13:46.044 --> 01:13:48.145
Wait. What about you?

520
01:13:49.345 --> 01:13:51.044
Keep her safe.

You have

Where's he taking Grace?

533
01:15:10.145 --> 01:15:12.044
Search the place.

534
01:15:12.078 --> 01:15:13.644
Find it.

535
01:15:17.011 --> 01:15:19.011
Fuck!

536
01:15:21.744 --> 01:15:23.777
What are we gonna do?

537
01:15:33.011 --> 01:15:34.644
Oh, yes.

538
01:15:36.145 --> 01:15:38.311
Hey! Hey.

539
01:15:38.345 --> 01:15:40.345
Come on, mate.

540
01:15:40.378 --> 01:15:41.844
Fuck!

541
01:15:42.811 --> 01:15:44.011
Yes.

542
01:15:47.178 --> 01:15:48.744
Look away.

543
01:16:13.411 --> 01:16:15.111
Ah, fuck.

544
01:16:17.011 --> 01:16:19.145
Here we go, mate.

545
01:16:19.178 --> 01:16:20.978
Brekkie time, come on.

546
01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:22.445
Here you go.

547
01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:24.378
There you go, mate. Go.

548
01:16:24.411 --> 01:16:26.044
Yes!

549
01:16:47.944 --> 01:16:50.411
Hey. You.

550
01:16:50.445 --> 01:16:52.211
Come and stick this up my nose.

551
01:16:52.245 --> 01:16:54.311
Stick it up your nose?

552
01:16:54.345 --> 01:16:56.178
Why?

553
01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:59.111
Don't you fucking question why,
you dumb sonofabitch!

554
01:16:59.145 --> 01:17:01.445
You just take
this fucking cannula

555
01:17:01.478 --> 01:17:03.345
and you stick it up my nose!

556
01:17:03.378 --> 01:17:06.078
I'll do it.

557
01:17:06.111 --> 01:17:09.111
OK, wait a minute.
Just don't be so fucking rough.

558
01:17:11.111 --> 01:17:13.178
Just not too far!

559
01:17:42.145 --> 01:17:44.844
I fucking knew it!
This guy's a bite-hider!

560
01:18:52.111 --> 01:18:54.145
Stay.

561
01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:11.744
Ah, Rhys.

562
01:19:13.011 --> 01:19:16.446
It actually does pain me
to see you like this.

563
01:19:16.479 --> 01:19:18.644
And I really can't tell you...

564
01:19:21.878 --> 01:19:24.311
...how much I'm gonna regret
killing you.

565
01:19:24.345 --> 01:19:26.111
After all...

566
01:19:27.111 --> 01:19:29.677
...I owe you my life!

567
01:19:31.345 --> 01:19:35.078
It was you, Rhys,
who kept me alive...

568
01:19:37.744 --> 01:19:39.211
for a full year.

569
01:19:39.245 --> 01:19:43.311
You were such
a good delivery boy.

570
01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:45.744
Fuck you!

571
01:19:55.044 --> 01:19:57.044
It's the darndest thing.

572
01:19:58.278 --> 01:20:00.446
You know what I can smell,
Rhys?

573
01:20:00.479 --> 01:20:04.346
Something I never, ever thought
I would smell on you, little man.

574
01:20:05.711 --> 01:20:07.644
Brains.

575
01:20:08.777 --> 01:20:11.744
I'm gonna crush your skull,

576
01:20:11.777 --> 01:20:14.278
scoop out your brains

577
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:17.178
and eat them, delivery boy!

578
01:23:13.145 --> 01:23:14.978
You take 'em.

579
01:23:16.412 --> 01:23:18.644
And you keep taking 'em.

580
01:23:19.744 --> 01:23:21.777
And you're gonna help us.

581
01:23:23.844 --> 01:23:26.111
That's how you
get your soul back.
