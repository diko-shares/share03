00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:54.624
Stop! Stop it!
Just stop it!

2
00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:00.374
- Agh!
- No!

3
00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:09.999
Shoot her! Shoot her!

4
00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.791
Don't! Don't do it!

5
00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:20.332
Brooke!
Wake the fuck up!

6
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:21.749
Here.

7
00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:30.374
Take it.

8
00:01:50.624 --> 00:01:52.166
Grace...

9
00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:55.666
Calm down.

10
00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:58.082
Stay the fuck away from us.

11
00:01:59.124 --> 00:02:01.124
Everything's alright now, OK?

12
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:03.916
She lost it,
but she's fine now.

13
00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:09.291
Everything's gonna be alright,
I promise you.

14
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:18.499
Agh!

15
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:20.624
No!

16
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.166
Let 'em go.

17
00:02:31.207 --> 00:02:33.499
You're all monsters!

18
00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:37.457
You're both the fucking same.

19
00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.749

Alpha Tango Charlie,

43
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:03.332
we have a southbound vehicle
approaching the 44 Lateral. Over.

44
00:08:08.249 --> 00:08:10.166
Roger that, Delta Zero.

45
00:08:10.332 --> 00:08:13.999
We have an eye in the sky
monitoring the 44 Lateral in the 3-3-12.

46
00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:16.541
Hotel Zebra, we have
a northbound two-wheeler

47
00:08:16.707 --> 00:08:20.499
approaching on the 23 Parallel
in Sector 1-1-38. Please confirm.

48
00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:21.541
Roger that.

49
00:09:03.207 --> 00:09:04.832
Fuck!

50
00:09:13.832 --> 00:09:15.332
Come on, mate.

51
00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:50.124
Come on.

52
00:09:51.832 --> 00:09:54.207
Come on.
Out you get.

53
00:09:59.249 --> 00:10:00.249
Hey!

54
00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:05.624
Open bunker door!

55
00:10:15.957 --> 00:10:18.082
Ah, Rhys!

56
00:10:19.957 --> 00:10:21.791
So...

57
00:10:21.957 --> 00:10:23.541
what's on the menu?

58
00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.707
We've got a male, early 20s.

59
00:10:26.874 --> 00:10:28.124
Bit banged up.
Concussed, maybe.

60
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:29.624
Otherwise good condition.

61
00:10:31.082 --> 00:10:32.999
- Bring him.
- Yes, sir.

62
00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:35.374
On your feet.

63
00:10:36.666 --> 00:10:38.499
Oh, yes.

64
00:10:38.666 --> 00:10:40.166
Fantastic.

65
00:10:40.332 --> 00:10:41.999
Excellent bone structure.

66
00:10:48.707 --> 00:10:50.457
That's one hell of
a lovely skull.

67
00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:54.416
- Get him inside.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:10:55.416 --> 00:10:58.457
Good work, Rhys.
Well done.

69
00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:01.957
You got him?

70
00:11:02.124 --> 00:11:03.749
Right. Right.

71
00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:07.249
Over there. Over here. Right.

72
00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:09.041
So are we any closer
to the cure?

73
00:11:09.207 --> 00:11:10.332
Yeah, of course we are.

74
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:17.999
The hybrid's been spotted,
and the brother.

75
00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:19.291
Where?

76
00:11:19.457 --> 00:11:21.499
Sector 8,
100 clicks to the north.

77
00:11:21.666 --> 00:11:23.082
And what about these other two?

78
00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:25.041
Who cares?

79
00:11:25.207 --> 00:11:26.791
We want the freak.

80
00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:27.874
The hybrid.

81
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:29.791
We get the girl.

82
00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:32.207
You get to put a bullet in that
prick who killed your brother.

83
00:11:35.166 --> 00:11:37.249
Ugh...

84
00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:39.791
Cramp. Yeah.

85
00:11:39.957 --> 00:11:41.791
Guess it's time for me to...

86
00:11:41.957 --> 00:11:43.707
rehydrate.

87
00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:45.749
- Yep.
- Off you go.

88
00:11:45.916 --> 00:11:47.249
Ah, just over here.

89
00:11:47.416 --> 00:11:49.207
Good luck out there, soldier.

90
00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:53.999
Now, you bring her in alive.

91
00:11:54.166 --> 00:11:55.916
Or you don't come knocking.

92
00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:57.832
You get me?

93
00:11:57.999 --> 00:11:58.999
Yeah.

94
00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:07.041
Pack of wankers.

95
00:12:07.207 --> 00:12:08.374
Close bunker door.

96
00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:22.416
We shouldn't have bloody left.

97
00:12:22.582 --> 00:12:24.457
She ripped
my fuckin' throat out, Maxi.

98
00:12:24.624 --> 00:12:26.166
What the fuck
are you talking about?

99
00:12:26.332 --> 00:12:27.499
Yeah, well whose fault
was that?

100
00:12:27.666 --> 00:12:30.166
I'm not just gonna sit there and
watch her torture some guy to death.

101
00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:32.499
- That guy was a soldier.
- She's sick.

102
00:12:32.666 --> 00:12:34.582
And she's getting worse.

103
00:12:34.749 --> 00:12:36.124
Her and her brother.

104
00:12:37.416 --> 00:12:39.666
They've gone road crazy.

105
00:12:41.541 --> 00:12:43.582
We can't trust 'em no more.

106
00:12:45.374 --> 00:12:47.124
Uncle Benny trusted 'em.

107
00:12:48.124 --> 00:12:49.749
Uncle Benny's dead.

108
00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:12.207
Grace?

109
00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:15.207
Fuck.

110
00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:30.791
Here, open your mouth.

111
00:13:30.957 --> 00:13:33.707
Here. Here, here.
Open, open!

112
00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:46.457
You alright?

113
00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:54.624
Here.

114
00:13:56.541 --> 00:13:57.707
Let's get going.

115
00:17:04.707 --> 00:17:06.082
Hi.

116
00:17:06.249 --> 00:17:07.499
No! No, no, no, no, no!

117
00:17:07.666 --> 00:17:09.666
Quiet!

118
00:17:45.874 --> 00:17:48.416
Oh...

119
00:17:48.582 --> 00:17:49.832
Access granted.

120
00:17:53.124 --> 00:17:55.082
Well, well, well.

121
00:17:55.249 --> 00:17:58.499
I told you never to bring
anybody in here while I'm working.

122
00:17:58.666 --> 00:18:00.791
Turns out you were right,
Sergeant.

123
00:18:00.957 --> 00:18:03.291
Looks like our Surgeon General
here's a bite-hider.

124
00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:05.832
You fuck.

125
00:18:05.999 --> 00:18:08.166
- Unholster your weapon.
- Yes, Colonel.

126
00:18:08.332 --> 00:18:09.499
Walk over there.

127
00:18:10.832 --> 00:18:12.957
- And blow his brains out.
- Yes, sir.

128
00:18:13.124 --> 00:18:14.541
Just hang on a minute.

129
00:18:15.916 --> 00:18:17.457
Just... Just wait!

130
00:18:22.624 --> 00:18:24.707
You need to
hide your symptoms better.

131
00:18:25.957 --> 00:18:26.999
Was that...

132
00:18:28.624 --> 00:18:30.749
...really necessary?

133
00:18:30.916 --> 00:18:33.249
You ever put me in a position
like that again...

134
00:18:34.457 --> 00:18:36.874
...I'll put a bullet
through your fuckin' skull.

135
00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:39.082
Yes, but then...

136
00:18:41.166 --> 00:18:43.707
...where would you get
your medicine from, Colonel?

137
00:18:47.957 --> 00:18:50.957
We're not going to make
our serum quota this month.

138
00:18:51.124 --> 00:18:54.207
HQ's gonna start
asking questions.

139
00:18:56.666 --> 00:18:58.041
Fuck HQ.

140
00:18:59.707 --> 00:19:01.332
And besides,

141
00:19:01.499 --> 00:19:03.374
once we get our hands on her...

142
00:19:07.041 --> 00:19:09.332
...we won't have to
worry about that anymore.

143
00:19:53.957 --> 00:19:57.041
Agh!

144
00:20:04.207 --> 00:20:07.416
Wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

145
00:20:23.499 --> 00:20:26.124
Jesus fucking Christ.

146
00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:27.416
You're a hybrid.

147
00:21:16.207 --> 00:21:17.707
What the fuck!

148
00:21:18.832 --> 00:21:20.499
Open bunker door!

149
00:21:22.791 --> 00:21:24.332
Fuck in" idiots.

150
00:21:38.832 --> 00:21:40.874
It's a bit late
for a barrel drop, ain't it?

151
00:21:41.041 --> 00:21:43.166
It's not your concern, champ.

152
00:21:45.249 --> 00:21:46.499
Oi! Oi!

153
00:21:46.666 --> 00:21:49.082
I need that fuckin' fuel
for the barrel drop,

154
00:21:49.249 --> 00:21:50.166
you fuckin' idiots.

155
00:21:50.332 --> 00:21:52.082
I need you right here,
Corporal.

156
00:21:53.749 --> 00:21:54.791
Yes, sir.

157
00:21:54.957 --> 00:21:57.249
What's the delivery?

158
00:21:57.416 --> 00:21:59.832
Female. Early 20S.

159
00:22:01.791 --> 00:22:03.541
She's a hybrid.

160
00:22:03.707 --> 00:22:05.082
Go get her now.

161
00:22:05.249 --> 00:22:06.374
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, Colonel.

162
00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:21.874
Fuck! Christ!

163
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:26.749
Oh, shoot her fuckin' legs out.

164
00:22:26.916 --> 00:22:29.332
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

165
00:22:29.499 --> 00:22:31.207
I can calm her down.
I can calm her down.

166
00:22:31.374 --> 00:22:32.582
Keep her still.

167
00:22:34.082 --> 00:22:35.207
Hold still, hold still.

168
00:22:35.374 --> 00:22:37.457
Here you go, hon.
Here you go, here you go.

169
00:22:37.624 --> 00:22:40.416
There you go. There you go.

170
00:22:40.582 --> 00:22:41.624
Easy.

171
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:43.874
Easy.

172
00:22:44.916 --> 00:22:46.541
It's gonna be alright.

173
00:22:46.707 --> 00:22:47.916
I promise.

174
00:22:51.082 --> 00:22:54.041
- Get her inside.
- Yes, sir.

175
00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:56.416
Oh, put it down,
you fuckin' idiot.

176
00:22:56.582 --> 00:22:58.124
Oi. Oi!

177
00:23:00.624 --> 00:23:02.999
I want to know
what goes on with this one.

178
00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:05.916
If she's a key to the cure,
I wanna know.

179
00:23:10.707 --> 00:23:12.416
You get in your truck.

180
00:23:12.582 --> 00:23:15.457
You drop your barrels
like a good little soldier

181
00:23:15.624 --> 00:23:17.082
and fuck off.

182
00:23:27.207 --> 00:23:28.832
Close bunker door!

183
00:23:53.374 --> 00:23:55.124
Oh, for fuck's...

184
00:23:55.291 --> 00:23:58.332
Now I've run out of
fuckin' fuel, haven't I?

185
00:24:03.124 --> 00:24:05.749
Ah, the fuck! Come on!
Come on, you fuck in'...

00:24:15.457 --> 00:24:17.332

00:25:18.207 --> 00:25:20.332
Come on.

00:25:20.499 --> 00:25:22.207
That's it. Come on, mate.

200
00:25:25.582 --> 00:25:27.499
Nah, fuck this.

00:25:48.499 --> 00:25:51.082
Come on, come on.

00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:53.291
Yes!

204
00:25:54.374 --> 00:25:56.249
I'll come back for you
tomorrow, mate.

205
00:26:24.332 --> 00:26:25.957
Who goes there?

206
00:26:26.124 --> 00:26:29.416
Hey, not on me,
you fuckin' peanut.

207
00:26:29.582 --> 00:26:31.957
Jesus Christ.

208
00:26:32.124 --> 00:26:33.457
I got barrels for ya.

209
00:26:33.624 --> 00:26:36.707
Ha! Fuckin' cop that, ya cunts!

210
00:26:41.374 --> 00:26:43.207
Fuck, yeah.

211
00:26:43.374 --> 00:26:44.457
Fuckin' pussy.

212
00:26:44.624 --> 00:26:45.624
You're an idiot.

213
00:27:03.041 --> 00:27:04.082
G'day.

214
00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:08.249
Is this one for the bunker?

215
00:27:09.999 --> 00:27:11.957
That for the boys
in the bunker, is it?

216
00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:17.791
Righto.
Barrels are in the back.

217
00:27:20.582 --> 00:27:22.124
Yes, sir.

218
00:27:42.124 --> 00:27:44.707
Dickhead.

219
00:27:44.874 --> 00:27:46.041
Fuck.

220
00:29:26.541 --> 00:29:28.332
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

221
00:29:28.499 --> 00:29:30.249
- Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no!
- Hold still!

222
00:29:51.291 --> 00:29:52.874
Not even gonna make it.

223
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:54.457
Fuckin' hell!

224
00:30:08.874 --> 00:30:10.249
Fuck! Come on!

225
00:30:17.874 --> 00:30:20.207
Hey! Hello!

226
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:23.457
Yes, yes, yes, look at this!

227
00:30:23.624 --> 00:30:26.249
Hey? Come on, get it!

228
00:30:26.416 --> 00:30:27.749
Fuck!

229
00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:11.791
I want you to take a deep
breath in through your nose

230
00:32:11.957 --> 00:32:16.874
and visualise
a stream of blue healing light

231
00:32:17.041 --> 00:32:20.874
travelling deep
into your crown chakra.

232
00:32:24.291 --> 00:32:28.207
This energy travels down into
your whole head...

233
00:32:40.374 --> 00:32:42.499
...sacred healing...

234
00:32:51.166 --> 00:32:52.541
Oh, fuck!

235
00:33:03.332 --> 00:33:04.999
Fuck!

236
00:33:09.124 --> 00:33:11.916
Let your entire being

237
00:33:12.082 --> 00:33:14.457
be free from fear.

238
00:33:14.624 --> 00:33:18.457
And completely at peace with
the universe.

239
00:33:50.874 --> 00:33:53.874
Whoa, easy.
Easy, easy!

240
00:33:56.124 --> 00:33:57.541
This is where you tell me

241
00:33:57.707 --> 00:33:58.999
you're gonna help me
get my sister back.

242
00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:00.707
Or I'll put this dart through
your fuckin' head.

243
00:34:00.874 --> 00:34:02.374
Sure.

244
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:03.957
Who's your sister?

245
00:34:11.791 --> 00:34:13.874
Me and you
are going for a drive.

246
00:34:14.916 --> 00:34:17.332
You'll have to get that wound
looked at.

247
00:34:18.957 --> 00:34:21.791
If you leave that you'll get
septicaemia and you'll die.

248
00:34:21.957 --> 00:34:23.249
Yeah, right.

249
00:34:23.416 --> 00:34:25.249
And all I have to do is
cut you loose, yeah?

250
00:34:25.416 --> 00:34:27.124
Listen, I'm sure there's some
way we can work this out

251
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:29.207
where we can both
trust each other.

252
00:34:35.791 --> 00:34:37.916
Listen, would you...

253
00:34:38.082 --> 00:34:40.624
Would you mind taking your
finger off that trigger there?

254
00:34:41.957 --> 00:34:43.582
Shut up and stitch.

255
00:34:47.249 --> 00:34:48.707
I'm doing it.

256
00:34:51.041 --> 00:34:52.541
Get your hands up.

257
00:34:53.582 --> 00:34:55.666
- Hands up!
- They're up.

258
00:34:55.832 --> 00:34:58.166
Fuckin' hell. God.

259
00:35:04.332 --> 00:35:06.041
Start the engine.

260
00:35:09.624 --> 00:35:11.041
Stop.

261
00:35:30.332 --> 00:35:33.166
OK, off we go.

262
00:35:33.332 --> 00:35:35.541
We have to open the gate.

263
00:35:35.707 --> 00:35:37.124
Smash through it.

264
00:35:37.291 --> 00:35:39.832
We'll bounce straight off and you're
gonna smash your face on the dashboard.

265
00:35:39.999 --> 00:35:41.707
Nah, that's bullshit.

266
00:35:41.874 --> 00:35:44.207
You just don't want to mess up
your nice little gate.

267
00:35:44.374 --> 00:35:45.957
It's your call.

268
00:35:46.124 --> 00:35:47.332
Do it.

269
00:36:10.082 --> 00:36:11.541
Nice truck.

270
00:36:15.707 --> 00:36:17.957
Not talking to me, huh?

271
00:36:18.124 --> 00:36:19.374
Suit yourself.

272
00:36:25.374 --> 00:36:27.249
What's that?

273
00:36:27.416 --> 00:36:28.791
What does it look like?

274
00:36:28.957 --> 00:36:29.999
They're pills.

275
00:36:31.124 --> 00:36:32.957
Anti-viral pills.

276
00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:35.124
It's how I stay alive up here.

277
00:36:40.832 --> 00:36:42.624
Why have you got this?

278
00:36:42.791 --> 00:36:45.749
'Cause they're terrorists.
They're killers.

279
00:36:48.957 --> 00:36:50.374
Ain't that what you do?

280
00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:52.749
No, that's not what I do.

281
00:36:52.916 --> 00:36:54.332
I've seen the bodies.

282
00:36:54.499 --> 00:36:57.541
You kidnap people
and you kill 'em!

283
00:36:57.707 --> 00:37:00.166
We don't kill anybody.

284
00:39:19.916 --> 00:39:22.624
- You got a package for us?
- Yeah.

285
00:39:27.249 --> 00:39:28.749
It's the hybrid girl's sister.

286
00:39:28.916 --> 00:39:30.499
No shit.

287
00:39:30.666 --> 00:39:32.666
You've been a busy boy, Rhys.

288
00:39:33.916 --> 00:39:35.582
Well played, mate.

289
00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:38.666
- Go and get her.
- Yes, sir.

290
00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:46.541
Fuck! Fuckin'...

291
00:39:50.582 --> 00:39:53.166
Hey! Hey take it easy, mate.
She's a fuckin' kid.

292
00:39:53.332 --> 00:39:55.582
Either way, this little prick's
gonna end up in a fuckin' barrel.

293
00:39:55.749 --> 00:39:56.832
What'd you say, mate?

294
00:39:56.999 --> 00:39:59.082
What'd he mean, "either way,
she ends up in a barrel"?

295
00:39:59.249 --> 00:40:00.499
What the fuck does that mean?

296
00:40:00.666 --> 00:40:03.499
It means get in your vehicle
and drive away, Corporal.

297
00:40:06.832 --> 00:40:08.457
Get in your vehicle.

298
00:40:08.624 --> 00:40:10.332
Drive away.

299
00:40:13.124 --> 00:40:14.291
Righto.

300
00:40:29.249 --> 00:40:31.416
Whoa.
What the fuck just happened?

301
00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:36.957
Get in the truck.

302
00:40:56.207 --> 00:40:58.166
Fuck!

303
00:41:12.249 --> 00:41:13.874
Shit. Shit!

304
00:41:27.666 --> 00:41:29.374
- Shit!
- Nitro activated.

305
00:41:29.541 --> 00:41:30.957
Fuck's sakes.

306
00:41:41.624 --> 00:41:44.457
Power priming.
- Come on! Prime! Fuckin' prime!

307
00:42:01.582 --> 00:42:05.207
Methane low.
Replace power source.

308
00:42:08.082 --> 00:42:10.457
Don't worry.
They don't have nitro.

309
00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:16.416
You sure about that?

310
00:42:18.916 --> 00:42:20.874
Fuckin' shit!!

311
00:42:34.666 --> 00:42:37.041
Wakey-wakey!

312
00:42:37.207 --> 00:42:38.916
Fuckin' get the dog!

313
00:42:42.749 --> 00:42:44.374
- Got the nuts!
- Bulls eye!

314
00:42:44.541 --> 00:42:47.124
How's that feel, slugger?

315
00:42:48.416 --> 00:42:51.082
Doesn't feel too good,
does it, hey?

316
00:42:51.249 --> 00:42:52.749
Fuckin' hurts.

317
00:42:54.791 --> 00:42:57.457
See, traitors get the death
penalty around here, Corporal.

318
00:42:59.166 --> 00:43:01.124
I reckon...

319
00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:03.082
any man

320
00:43:03.249 --> 00:43:05.749
who kicks another man
in the balls when he's down...

321
00:43:07.082 --> 00:43:09.332
don't deserve
a soldier's death.

322
00:43:09.499 --> 00:43:13.082
See, your brother,
he died with dignity.

323
00:43:13.249 --> 00:43:14.457
Honour.

324
00:43:14.624 --> 00:43:16.291
Like a real man.

325
00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:26.999
But you're not a real man,
are ya, hey?

326
00:43:27.166 --> 00:43:29.416
You're a dog.

327
00:43:29.582 --> 00:43:31.999
You're a lowdown, dirty dog.

328
00:43:32.166 --> 00:43:34.624
And you're gonna die
like a fuckin' dog.

329
00:43:36.041 --> 00:43:38.957
You see these old boys,
creeping up?

330
00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:46.416
They'll be here
in a couple of minutes.

331
00:43:46.582 --> 00:43:49.249
And when they get here, they're
gonna eat you from the feet up.

332
00:43:50.457 --> 00:43:52.082
First your feet.

333
00:43:52.249 --> 00:43:53.999
Then your legs.

334
00:43:54.166 --> 00:43:55.624
Your balls.

335
00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:57.166
In that order.

336
00:44:00.041 --> 00:44:02.207
Big tough guy like you.

337
00:44:02.374 --> 00:44:04.624
You could still be alive
when they get to your guts.

338
00:44:08.624 --> 00:44:10.249
You have a good one now, eh?

339
00:46:20.041 --> 00:46:22.082
Well, well, well.

340
00:46:22.249 --> 00:46:24.707
Look what
the cat's dragged in, eh?

341
00:46:34.207 --> 00:46:35.999
Unless I'm mistaken

342
00:46:36.166 --> 00:46:38.707
didn't we take care of
this piece of shit already?

343
00:46:40.082 --> 00:46:42.124
That was my brother.

344
00:46:42.291 --> 00:46:43.874
Your brother?

345
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:46.457
So twins?

346
00:46:46.624 --> 00:46:48.582
Your brother, eh?

347
00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:52.707
He was a fuckwit

348
00:46:52.874 --> 00:46:55.291
who got exactly
what he deserved.

349
00:46:58.166 --> 00:46:59.791
I'm gonna kill ya.

350
00:46:59.957 --> 00:47:01.499
Nah, mate.

351
00:47:01.666 --> 00:47:04.874
No, the only thing you're gonna
do is sit there and bleed

352
00:47:05.041 --> 00:47:06.874
until I fuckin' say so!

353
00:47:08.499 --> 00:47:10.666
You were the one that
crashed their rig on the road.

354
00:47:10.832 --> 00:47:13.874
You gave Gracie to those
butchers in the bunker.

355
00:47:22.457 --> 00:47:24.541
Then again...

356
00:47:24.707 --> 00:47:28.124
Maxi also tells me
you saved her life.

357
00:47:29.249 --> 00:47:30.999
Still, I don't know.

358
00:47:32.624 --> 00:47:34.791
There's just
something about ya.

359
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:42.749
His face.

360
00:47:42.916 --> 00:47:45.416
I hate this face!

361
00:47:45.582 --> 00:47:47.499
That's it. The face.

362
00:47:47.666 --> 00:47:49.291
The face is a real problem.

363
00:47:50.416 --> 00:47:53.666
I just wanna rip it off
and eat the fuckin' thing.

364
00:47:53.832 --> 00:47:55.624
What do you think, Maxi?

365
00:47:55.791 --> 00:47:57.249
Is this guy a friend

366
00:47:57.416 --> 00:47:58.999
or is he dog food?

367
00:48:02.166 --> 00:48:03.624
Dog food.

368
00:48:07.499 --> 00:48:09.666
What do you say, soldier boy?

369
00:48:09.832 --> 00:48:11.499
You our friend

370
00:48:11.666 --> 00:48:13.832
or do I bite your face off?

371
00:48:13.999 --> 00:48:15.666
I'm a friend, yeah.

372
00:48:15.832 --> 00:48:17.166
Definitely the friend.

373
00:49:15.707 --> 00:49:17.791
How many men in there?

374
00:49:17.957 --> 00:49:19.999
Five.

375
00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:21.624
Two out front

376
00:49:21.791 --> 00:49:23.582
and two with guns and a medic.

377
00:49:23.749 --> 00:49:26.291
- And their hardware?
- Just the usual.

378
00:49:26.457 --> 00:49:29.124
Steyrs, shotguns,
Glocks, grenades.

379
00:49:30.291 --> 00:49:32.624
If we get the drop on them,
none of that'll matter.

380
00:49:32.791 --> 00:49:33.791
We'll take 'em.

381
00:49:35.207 --> 00:49:36.624
Oi.

382
00:49:37.666 --> 00:49:40.291
You cut me loose,
I can guarantee that.

383
00:49:46.874 --> 00:49:48.499
Bit of a nasty cough.

384
00:49:48.666 --> 00:49:49.791
You a bit crook, are ya?

385
00:49:51.082 --> 00:49:52.749
Looking for these?

386
00:49:55.541 --> 00:49:56.957
What's in 'em?

387
00:49:57.124 --> 00:49:58.541
I don't fuckin' know.

388
00:50:01.707 --> 00:50:03.249
Give 'em to him.

389
00:50:09.957 --> 00:50:11.332
Ah, fuck it.

390
00:50:14.207 --> 00:50:15.749
Oh, you fuck!

391
00:50:22.957 --> 00:50:24.624
How can you do it?

392
00:50:29.416 --> 00:50:31.166
I didn't know.

393
00:50:31.332 --> 00:50:32.582
What do you mean,
you didn't know?

394
00:50:32.749 --> 00:50:35.082
I didn't know
they were killing them. I...

395
00:50:35.249 --> 00:50:38.082
- Bullshit.
- You think I give a fuck what you think, love?

396
00:50:40.666 --> 00:50:43.041
- Brooke...
- You knew!

397
00:50:59.874 --> 00:51:01.457
You all good?

398
00:51:03.374 --> 00:51:06.124
You reckon
you can get us in there?

399
00:51:07.416 --> 00:51:08.666
Easy.

400
00:51:11.916 --> 00:51:13.499
What the...?

401
00:51:31.541 --> 00:51:33.791
- Intruders!
- We're under attack!

402
00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:35.749
- We've been surrounded!
- Get down!

403
00:52:29.082 --> 00:52:31.332
Friend of yours?

404
00:52:31.499 --> 00:52:33.874
I picked him up
a couple of days ago.

405
00:52:34.041 --> 00:52:35.582
Not far from here.

406
00:52:45.457 --> 00:52:47.082
Now you know.

407
00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:17.457
What do you do with them?

408
00:53:17.624 --> 00:53:19.041
Down in the bunkers?

409
00:53:20.499 --> 00:53:22.624
We grow a curative serum
inside them

410
00:53:22.791 --> 00:53:24.082
and then extract it.

411
00:53:24.249 --> 00:53:26.457
And this serum.
It cures people?

412
00:53:26.624 --> 00:53:29.499
Not cures. Manages.
It's preventative.

413
00:53:29.666 --> 00:53:31.624
Keeps the virus
from taking hold.

414
00:53:31.791 --> 00:53:34.957
Listen, I have medical supplies
that could last you a year.

415
00:53:35.124 --> 00:53:36.957
Hundreds of rounds
of ammunition.

416
00:53:37.124 --> 00:53:40.082
Explosives. Grenades, mate.
Whatever you want.

417
00:53:41.582 --> 00:53:43.124
Why the barrels?

418
00:53:44.332 --> 00:53:46.457
You should know.

419
00:53:50.832 --> 00:53:52.416
We grind 'em up

420
00:53:52.582 --> 00:53:54.791
then convert them
to powder form.

421
00:53:54.957 --> 00:53:56.832
Pills.

422
00:53:56.999 --> 00:53:58.832
We make pills.

423
00:54:30.707 --> 00:54:31.749
Oi!

424
00:54:34.999 --> 00:54:37.999
Move and I'll
blow his fuckin' head off!

425
00:54:41.457 --> 00:54:42.957
These...

426
00:54:43.124 --> 00:54:44.416
fucks...

427
00:54:46.499 --> 00:54:48.666
...they took my soul.

428
00:54:50.249 --> 00:54:52.624
And so I am gonna go down

429
00:54:52.791 --> 00:54:55.832
into that bunker with you

430
00:54:55.999 --> 00:54:59.582
and we're gonna kill every last
one of those sons-of-bitches.

431
00:55:03.041 --> 00:55:04.791
I gotta make this right.

432
00:55:12.166 --> 00:55:13.791
Fuckin' A.

433
00:55:39.707 --> 00:55:42.166
Colonel. You OK?

434
00:55:42.332 --> 00:55:43.957
I'm fine.

435
00:55:44.124 --> 00:55:45.666
You fine?

436
00:55:45.832 --> 00:55:47.832
Go and check the perimeter!

437
00:55:53.332 --> 00:55:54.832
Access granted.

438
00:56:03.041 --> 00:56:05.707
Ah, Colonel!
Care for a toot?

439
00:56:06.999 --> 00:56:09.374
No? No, no. Wait!

440
00:56:11.041 --> 00:56:12.916
It's not that simple.

441
00:56:13.082 --> 00:56:15.624
You just can't suck it out of
her like we do with the others.

442
00:56:15.791 --> 00:56:17.916
That would be like
injecting rocket fuel.

443
00:56:21.374 --> 00:56:23.582
We have a situation upstairs,
Colonel.

444
00:56:26.999 --> 00:56:28.832
Well, fuck me.

445
00:56:34.291 --> 00:56:36.124
It's taking too long.

446
00:56:36.291 --> 00:56:37.624
Something's wrong.

447
00:56:37.791 --> 00:56:39.332
No way. Give it time.

448
00:56:43.916 --> 00:56:46.082
Here we go.
Come on!

449
00:56:58.124 --> 00:56:59.832
Alright, here we go.

450
00:57:06.457 --> 00:57:09.082
- Come on, get ready. Another one down.
- Suppress your fire!

451
00:58:10.999 --> 00:58:13.082
Shit. Shit!

452
00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:24.249
Rhys.

453
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:37.916
Go! Go, go, go, go!

454
00:59:59.791 --> 01:00:02.499
Lima Papa Zulu,
we have a 187 on the 22.

455
01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:04.291
Requesting a link-up, over.

456
01:00:09.166 --> 01:00:11.916
Victor Kilo India, we have a
trapped RV in the 93 Parallel.

457
01:00:12.082 --> 01:00:13.707
Requesting immediate choppers.

458
01:00:38.207 --> 01:00:40.916
You take her. I got the brother
and the delivery boy.

459
01:00:41.082 --> 01:00:42.957
Yeah. Yeah, agreed.

460
01:00:43.124 --> 01:00:44.957
You start on her
before I get back...

461
01:00:46.957 --> 01:00:49.041
..I'll fuckin' kill ya.

462
01:00:49.207 --> 01:00:51.957
Oh, yeah?
Like you killed Rhys?

463
01:00:52.124 --> 01:00:56.374
Well, forgive me if I'm
not trembling in my booties.

464
01:01:10.957 --> 01:01:12.999
Whoa, what the fuck
is this shit?

465
01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:14.416
Don't worry.

466
01:01:14.582 --> 01:01:17.624
It's a cleansing agent.
It kills the virus.

467
01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:19.249
What's it made out of?

468
01:01:25.832 --> 01:01:27.749
Stay quiet.
They're coming down now.

469
01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:07.374
She's alive.

470
01:02:07.541 --> 01:02:08.666
Get that door open.

471
01:02:14.249 --> 01:02:16.499
Fuck! Ow!

472
01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:19.249
- What the fuck was that?
- Sorry.

473
01:02:22.957 --> 01:02:24.707
Oh, fuck me.

474
01:02:44.791 --> 01:02:46.124
Access denied.

475
01:03:22.416 --> 01:03:23.832
OK.

476
01:03:43.499 --> 01:03:44.999
G'day, boys.

477
01:03:54.666 --> 01:03:56.166
Drop 'em.

478
01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:59.541
Or I'll blow
her fuckin' head off.

479
01:04:03.957 --> 01:04:05.541
All of 'em.

480
01:04:09.082 --> 01:04:10.832
Now kick 'em over.

481
01:04:14.666 --> 01:04:16.624
Good lads.

482
01:04:16.791 --> 01:04:18.291
Hey!

483
01:04:18.457 --> 01:04:19.832
Weak fuckin'... Ohh!

484
01:04:19.999 --> 01:04:22.249
This the prick
who killed your brother?

485
01:04:25.416 --> 01:04:27.082
Thought so.

486
01:04:30.707 --> 01:04:32.874
Now, you see,

487
01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:35.874
if some dirty bastard
killed my brother,

488
01:04:36.041 --> 01:04:39.957
I'd make sure I'd do him
nice and slow.

489
01:04:56.749 --> 01:04:58.707
Hello, toots!

490
01:04:58.874 --> 01:05:01.457
Would you mind
if I cracked open your skull

491
01:05:01.624 --> 01:05:03.624
and feasted
on the juice inside?

492
01:05:45.457 --> 01:05:48.457
What are you up to, big guy?
Huh?

493
01:05:56.291 --> 01:05:59.332
Don't you know that a bloke with
his guts hanging on the outside

494
01:05:59.499 --> 01:06:02.957
should have enough sense
to fuckin' die!

495
01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:52.499
Emergency power activated.

496
01:09:00.291 --> 01:09:02.374
Agh!

497
01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:10.041
1138, we just came from
Pill Factory 5B

498
01:09:10.207 --> 01:09:12.791
and it's a fuckin'
slaughterhouse over there.

499
01:09:12.957 --> 01:09:15.832
Did you guys have any trouble
in your sector today?

500
01:09:15.999 --> 01:09:18.874
Get your arses
up here now!

501
01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:23.624
Don't worry about me.

502
01:09:25.624 --> 01:09:27.457
We need to get that door open.

503
01:09:36.499 --> 01:09:38.082
Brooke, you OK?

504
01:09:40.291 --> 01:09:41.291
Brooke?

505
01:09:46.666 --> 01:09:48.499
Brooke?

506
01:09:48.666 --> 01:09:50.249
Oh, shit, that's not good.

507
01:09:55.707 --> 01:09:57.082
Wait, don't shoot her.

508
01:09:57.249 --> 01:09:58.749
What the fuck do I do, then?

509
01:09:58.916 --> 01:10:00.124
Get in! Quick!

510
01:10:01.666 --> 01:10:03.832
Quick! Quick!

511
01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.041
Fucking hell.

512
01:10:13.249 --> 01:10:15.041
That cage door's
not gonna hold!

513
01:10:15.207 --> 01:10:16.541
Give me a blood vial now.

514
01:10:18.707 --> 01:10:20.457
- Shit.
- Come on!

515
01:10:20.624 --> 01:10:23.416
Shit.
They're cracked.

516
01:10:23.582 --> 01:10:25.374
- All of 'em!
- Oh, for...

517
01:10:25.541 --> 01:10:26.749
Fuck!

518
01:10:28.749 --> 01:10:30.791
So it's just blood
that calms her down, right?

519
01:10:30.957 --> 01:10:32.041
That's right.

520
01:10:39.874 --> 01:10:41.624
I think I have an idea.

521
01:10:41.791 --> 01:10:43.332
Yeah, 'course you do.

522
01:10:48.916 --> 01:10:50.207
Go!

523
01:11:16.416 --> 01:11:18.332
Agh!

524
01:11:47.374 --> 01:11:49.957
Get your sister out of here.

525
01:12:07.499 --> 01:12:09.166
It's OK.

526
01:12:11.249 --> 01:12:12.749
Help me up.

527
01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:27.374
Fuck.

528
01:12:32.332 --> 01:12:34.124
Get back!

529
01:12:43.374 --> 01:12:44.541
You right?

530
01:12:46.457 --> 01:12:47.749
You fuck!

533
01:13:01.207 --> 01:13:02.499
Get to the elevator.

Get in. Now!

543
01:13:45.207 --> 01:13:46.124
- Come on.
- No!

544
01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:48.082
Wait. What about you?

545
01:13:49.541 --> 01:13:51.332
Keep her safe.

546
01:13:51.499 --> 01:13:53.874
You have 10 seconds
to evacuate.

547
01:13:56.457 --> 01:13:57.541
Nine.

548
01:14:00.916 --> 01:14:02.249
Eight.

549
01:14:04.874 --> 01:14:06.249
Seven.

550
01:14:08.916 --> 01:14:10.124
Six.

551
01:14:12.749 --> 01:14:13.749
Five.

552
01:14:15.124 --> 01:14:16.457
Four.

553
01:14:18.207 --> 01:14:19.416
Three.

554
01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:23.082
Two.

555
01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:26.957
One.

556
01:14:28.999 --> 01:14:32.582
Self-destruct initiated.
Goodbye.

557
01:14:41.249 --> 01:14:43.207
Where's he taking Grace?

558
01:15:10.374 --> 01:15:12.124
Search the place.

559
01:15:12.291 --> 01:15:13.457
Find it.

560
01:15:17.124 --> 01:15:18.916
Fuck!

561
01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:23.624
What are we gonna do?

562
01:15:33.082 --> 01:15:34.457
Oh, yes.

563
01:15:36.374 --> 01:15:38.499
Hey! Hey.

564
01:15:38.666 --> 01:15:40.541
Come on, mate.

565
01:15:40.707 --> 01:15:41.707
Fuck!

566
01:15:42.916 --> 01:15:43.916
Yes.

567
01:15:47.416 --> 01:15:48.582
Look away.

568
01:16:13.707 --> 01:16:15.041
Ah, fuck.

569
01:16:17.207 --> 01:16:19.291
Here we go, mate.

570
01:16:19.457 --> 01:16:21.124
Breakie time, come on.

571
01:16:21.291 --> 01:16:22.624
Here you go.

572
01:16:22.791 --> 01:16:24.624
There you go, mate. Go.

573
01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:25.957
Yes!

574
01:16:45.082 --> 01:16:46.707
Agh!

575
01:16:48.124 --> 01:16:50.582
Hey. You.

576
01:16:50.749 --> 01:16:52.541
Come and stick this up my nose.

577
01:16:52.707 --> 01:16:55.041
Stick it up your nose?

578
01:16:55.207 --> 01:16:56.374
Why?

579
01:16:56.541 --> 01:16:59.374
Don't you fucking question why,
you dumb son-of-a-bitch!

580
01:16:59.541 --> 01:17:01.707
You just take
this fucking cannula

581
01:17:01.874 --> 01:17:03.582
and you stick it up my nose!

582
01:17:03.749 --> 01:17:04.624
I'll do it.

583
01:17:06.332 --> 01:17:09.041
OK, wait a minute.
Just don't be so fucking rough.

584
01:17:11.332 --> 01:17:13.416
Just not too far!

585
01:17:42.416 --> 01:17:44.707
I fucking knew it!
This guy's a bite-hider!

586
01:18:43.374 --> 01:18:44.957
Agh!

587
01:18:52.249 --> 01:18:54.082
Stay.

588
01:19:10.416 --> 01:19:11.582
Ah, Rhys.

589
01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:16.666
It actually does pain me
to see you like this.

590
01:19:16.832 --> 01:19:18.457
And I really can't tell you...

591
01:19:22.082 --> 01:19:24.541
...how much I'm gonna regret
killing you.

592
01:19:24.707 --> 01:19:26.041
After all...

593
01:19:27.291 --> 01:19:29.499
...owe you my life!

594
01:19:31.749 --> 01:19:34.999
It was you, Rhys,
who kept me alive...

595
01:19:37.749 --> 01:19:39.499
for a full year.

596
01:19:39.666 --> 01:19:43.582
You were such
a good delivery boy.

597
01:19:43.749 --> 01:19:45.582
Fuck you!

598
01:19:55.124 --> 01:19:56.957
It's the darndest thing.

599
01:19:58.624 --> 01:20:00.499
You know what I can smell,
Rhys?

600
01:20:00.666 --> 01:20:04.332
Something I never, ever thought
I would smell on you, little man.

601
01:20:05.707 --> 01:20:07.457
Brains.

602
01:20:08.874 --> 01:20:11.791
I'm gonna crush your skull,

603
01:20:11.957 --> 01:20:14.499
scoop out your brains

604
01:20:14.666 --> 01:20:17.416
and eat them, delivery boy!

605
01:23:13.291 --> 01:23:14.874
You take 'em.

606
01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:18.457
And you keep taking 'em.

607
01:23:20.249 --> 01:23:21.624
And you're gonna help us.

608
01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:26.041
That's how you
get your soul back.
