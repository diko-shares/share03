00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:39.119
Thought you got scared.

3
00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:40.519
About to roll without you.

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:13.859
About time, young gun.

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.179

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.485

13
00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:24.699

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.619
- Hey, dame.

16
00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.379

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.019
Nice to meet you.
How y'all doing today?

18
00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.969
Boy, come on, man.
Come on. Focus up, man.

19
00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.599
We got plenty of time for that.

20
00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:41.849
Trust.

21
00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.809
Ooh. Hello, pot.
Man, you see that ring?

22
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:48.329
That's easy money.

23
00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.285
And I ain't even tell you
who you've got yet.

24
00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:51.349
Come on.

25
00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:53.609
Let's get it.

26
00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.079
Michael fitzbaum.

27
00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:58.999
Orthodox. Solid fighter.

28
00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.059
Say he gonna be the first cat
to knock you out.

29
00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:05.999
Hey, but he do got a good jab.

30
00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.789
He overreaches though.

31
00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.349
He tore his labrum last year
playing football
for pali, so...

32
00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.049
- Make him miss.
- Yeah.

33
00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:13.249

34
00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.809

Yeah.

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:33.829
See you out there.

39
00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:43.609
First round knockout. Damian.

40
00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:45.655

Fight.

49
00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.999
Show him
what you're made of, boy.

50
00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:19.689
Watch the right.

51
00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.079
Hey, watch that jab.

52
00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.269
Hey, be patient. Be patient.

53
00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:28.879
Keep that guard up, bro.

54
00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:32.549
Wait for it.
It's gonna come to you.

55
00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:37.409
Watch this. Checkmate.

56
00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.099
Oh, my god! Come on!

57
00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:49.799
And the winner,
by way of knockout,

58
00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.719
- new golden gloves champion...
- What'd I say, boy?
That's how I do.

59
00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.769
"Diamond" dame Anderson!

60
00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:56.969
Yeah.

61
00:05:58.299 --> 00:05:59.809
Let's get it, boy.

62
00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.729
Let's get it, man.
What did I tell you, huh?

63
00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:04.079
What'd I tell you?
I sat that boy down.

64
00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.819
That straight right,
it's clean.
That's the perfect punch.

65
00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:10.429
Bro, but when
you put him to sleep, though,
everybody was...

66
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:12.135
- What?
- He was over there like...

67
00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:16.659
Man, the first thing

68
00:06:16.859 --> 00:06:18.829
The first thing i'ma do,

69
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:21.399

70
00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:23.139
Hey.

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:25.069
I'ma get you one too,
little homey.

72
00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:26.809
Hey.

73
00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:28.799
Yes, sir.

74
00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:30.759
- Appreciate you.
- No doubt, man.

75
00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:32.279
- For real.
- No doubt.

76
00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.689
You know, actually,
I got you something too.

77
00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:36.989
It belonged to my pops.

78
00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:41.509
It's original.

79
00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:42.829
Rumble in the jungle?

80
00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:44.639
Yeah.

81
00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:45.839
Yeah.

82
00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.309
I'ma get there one day.

83
00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:52.969
Yeah, i'ma get there.

84
00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.879
I'ma win nationals,

85
00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:59.219
taking home
the gold at the Olympics,

86
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.759
and then I'm turning pro.

87
00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:04.759
Don't trip.
You'll be right there with me.

88
00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.139
Shit, someone gotta
carry my bags.

89
00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:10.809
Bro, why you gotta
play with me like that, bro?

90
00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.625
I already know
what I want. What you getting?

91
00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:18.019
- Cherry pie, apple pie.
- Cherry pie?

92
00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:20.109
- Got you. Chili cheese fries?
- Yeah, come on.

93
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:21.809
- Pineapple soda?
- All that.

94
00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.209
All on you, boy. Big money.

95
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:29.309
Leon?

96
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.959
Huh?

97
00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.649
Don't remember me, do you?

98
00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:35.689
Am I supposed to remember you?

99
00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.329
Not so little anymore.

100
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:40.269
My name's Donnie.
You remember me now?

101
00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:47.219
We're live, round one,
Cape Town, South Africa,

102
00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:49.569
as Adonis creed
battles his old rival

103
00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:52.139
in what creed has said
will be his final fight.

104
00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:54.749
Todd Grisham
alongside the champion,
Jessica mccaskill.

105
00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:57.929
And right out of the gate
with an impressive combo.

106
00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:00.929
Is Conlan looking this good
or creed looking this bad?

107
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:02.849
If he doesn't do something fast,

108
00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.549
he's going to end
his historic career

109
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:06.239
with another loss to Conlan.

110
00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:08.079
- There we go.
- Put that jab in his face.

111
00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:12.309
Okay. Same creed.
Ain't nothing changed.

112
00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:15.929
Conlan stalking his prey,

113
00:08:16.059 --> 00:08:17.779
pushing creed
towards the corner.

114
00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:19.125
You've got to wonder

115
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:21.049
if the moment
is getting to creed here.

116
00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:25.959
Conlan is banging away
with the right hand.

117
00:08:26.159 --> 00:08:27.789
Look to your right.

118
00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:29.395
Seems to be the same combination

119
00:08:29.419 --> 00:08:31.499
he's throwing over and over,
and creed can't stop it.

120
00:08:36.939 --> 00:08:38.619
Creed,
getting out of the corner.

121
00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:42.319
Good jab,
but Conlan not fazed at all.

122
00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:45.499
Keep that in his face.
Keep that jab out there.

123
00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:47.859
- Big left from Conlan.
- Get off that rope.

124
00:08:48.009 --> 00:08:50.419
Oh, he's got him on the ropes.
Clean shots landing.

125
00:08:50.619 --> 00:08:52.129
Creed taking quite a beating.

126
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:56.509
And wow.
Conlan almost had him.

127
00:08:56.709 --> 00:08:59.599
Next round's
gonna hurt, champ.
Next round's gonna hurt.

128
00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:02.339
You okay, Donnie?

129
00:09:02.539 --> 00:09:04.689
Come on, Donnie.
You gotta work, baby.

130
00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:07.389
Yo, what you smiling for, dawg?

131
00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.609
He over there
beating you worse
than last time.

132
00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:11.479
Like, is something I miss
that's funny?

133
00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:14.569
Yeah, man. Checkmate.

134
00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:18.009
Checkmate? Oh, okay.
You sure about that?

135
00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:20.009
I ain't never been scared
of a little contact.

136
00:09:21.239 --> 00:09:23.149
I'm going out how I came in.

137
00:09:23.349 --> 00:09:26.239
Man, you're crazy, all right.

138
00:09:26.439 --> 00:09:28.589
Stop playing, knock him out.

139
00:09:28.789 --> 00:09:30.545
- How you feeling?
Looking great.
- I'm just warming up.

140
00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:32.589
He had a good run.

141
00:09:32.789 --> 00:09:34.309
But it's time
to take back what's ours.

142
00:09:50.359 --> 00:09:52.309
Creed's had a remarkable career,

143
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.005
but you wonder if father time
has finally caught up
with the champ.

144
00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:56.499
This is getting dangerous
for creed.

145
00:09:58.059 --> 00:10:00.439
Ooh, the champ
finally lands one.

146
00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:03.399
Come on, Donnie. Work this.
Show him who's champ.

147
00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:05.449
Beautiful, Ricky.
Beautiful. Just like that.

148
00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:06.649
One more time.

149
00:10:23.699 --> 00:10:26.299
And down goes Conlan!
He goes down!

150
00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:28.989
What a moment!
And I don't think
he's gonna get up, Jessica.

151
00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:32.779
Three, four, five,

152
00:10:32.979 --> 00:10:34.829
six, seven,

153
00:10:35.029 --> 00:10:36.049
eight,

154
00:10:36.249 --> 00:10:37.699
nine,

155
00:10:37.899 --> 00:10:38.899
ten.

156
00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:39.829
Yeah!

157
00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:41.185
And that's it, folks.

158
00:10:41.209 --> 00:10:42.405
It's over.

159
00:10:42.429 --> 00:10:44.619
What a chess move
from Adonis creed.

160
00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:45.925
Just incredible.

161
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:47.579
What a turn. What an ending.

162
00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:50.839
That's how you go out.

163
00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:53.279
Who would expect anything less
from Adonis creed

164
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:56.279
as he takes his final bow
on the world stage?

165
00:10:56.479 --> 00:10:57.479
What an exit.

166
00:10:57.659 --> 00:10:59.629
Respect, Conlan.
Hell of a fight.

167
00:10:59.829 --> 00:11:02.849
And that means
we've got a new, undisputed

168
00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:04.379
heavyweight champion
of the world

169
00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:06.549
for the first time
in two decades,

170
00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.829
and his name is Adonis creed.

171
00:11:48.479 --> 00:11:49.549
What's up?

172
00:11:49.749 --> 00:11:51.259
You don't remember.

173
00:11:51.609 --> 00:11:53.049
Remember what?

174
00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:56.229
C'mon, daddy. You promised.

175
00:11:58.499 --> 00:11:59.499
Five minutes.

176
00:12:06.189 --> 00:12:07.409
Okay, okay, okay.

177
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:16.639
Yes. All right.

178
00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:32.899
Would you like

185
00:13:05.349 --> 00:13:06.589
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

186
00:13:06.789 --> 00:13:08.245
This the track you've been
working on for kehlani?

187
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:09.459
- Yeah.
- Okay.

188
00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:11.289
We had a good session,
but I don't know.

189
00:13:11.489 --> 00:13:13.425
What you mean you don't know?
Can you send this to me?

190
00:13:13.449 --> 00:13:14.989
- Yes, yes.
- I need this in the car.

191
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:16.469
How was today?

192
00:13:16.669 --> 00:13:18.079
- It was good. Yeah.
- Yeah?

193
00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:20.859
- Thank you
for holding it down.
- I got you.

194
00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:22.169
Did you get her to bed?

195
00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:23.519
- I did.
- Mmm.

196
00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:25.209
So, I'm not gonna lie.

197
00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:27.215
I had to bribe her
with about six scoops
of ice cream.

198
00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:28.475
I don't even know how she sleep.

199
00:13:28.499 --> 00:13:30.389
Retirement made you soft,
you know that?

200
00:13:30.589 --> 00:13:32.259
I can't tell that girl no.

201
00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:34.745
I think you had
a couple scoops too
'cause look, you got this.

202
00:13:34.769 --> 00:13:35.769
- Mmm.
- Uh-huh.

203
00:13:35.859 --> 00:13:37.339
- Yeah, that's bad.
- Yeah.

204
00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:39.019
Take that off
before it stains, d.

205
00:13:40.589 --> 00:13:41.925
Oh, I see
what you're trying to do.

206
00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:43.229
What's that?

207
00:13:43.429 --> 00:13:45.449
You're trying to get me naked.

208
00:13:45.649 --> 00:13:47.895
Oh, no, no. I'm definitely
not trying to do that
'cause I'm trying to work.

209
00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:49.155
I see what you were
trying to do.

210
00:13:49.179 --> 00:13:51.149
No, you can just own it.
It's okay.

211
00:13:51.349 --> 00:13:52.675
I know you just wanna
see all this.

212
00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:54.155
- No, no, no.
- Look at that.

213
00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:55.179
No.

214
00:13:55.309 --> 00:13:57.859
Still hot? Still warm?

215
00:13:58.059 --> 00:13:59.859
- Stop it.
- I'm working, d. Please.

216
00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:01.815
I'm working too.
Listen,
I don't get a chance to...

217
00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:03.909
What are you working on?

218
00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:06.475
I don't get no alone time
with you no more
'cause you be hard at work.

219
00:14:06.499 --> 00:14:07.499
I know. Yeah.

220
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:09.259
- You ain't got no time for me.
- I know.

221
00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:10.959
You ain't got time for...

222
00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:13.485
- I know,
but I don't have time now.
- So come on. You don't?

223
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:15.829
- No. No.
- Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.

224
00:14:17.109 --> 00:14:19.409
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

225
00:14:20.939 --> 00:14:22.359
Don't you miss when...

226
00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:26.059
We used to...
Anywhere.

227
00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:28.359
- Any place?
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:30.449
Mm-mmm. Okay.

229
00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:31.669
Okay, let's go.

230
00:14:31.869 --> 00:14:33.759
Okay, I just... I have, like,
about 15 minutes

231
00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:35.799
- because I have to send
these stems.
- Fifteen.

232
00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:37.109
How about 12?

233
00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:38.669
All right.
Twelve will do.

234
00:14:44.319 --> 00:14:46.479
<i>Next stop, leimert park.</i>

235
00:15:10.459 --> 00:15:12.249
Body, head. Body, head.

236
00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:15.589
Efficiency over power, baby.
Give it to him.

237
00:15:19.349 --> 00:15:21.289
Technique. Technique, Felix.

238
00:15:21.489 --> 00:15:23.809
You can't just punch
your way through drago.

239
00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:26.989
We got a plan, so stick to it.

240
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:29.229
- Come on.
Make him work for it.
- Let's go.

241
00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:31.649
It's not only about power.
It's timing, speed.

242
00:15:31.849 --> 00:15:34.049
- Shit, you're telling me?
Come on now.
- I know, I know.

243
00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:35.389
Keep drilling into him.

244
00:15:35.589 --> 00:15:37.559
Technique. Technique.

245
00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:38.759
Time.

246
00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:40.649
Hey! Time!

247
00:15:40.849 --> 00:15:42.059
Felix. Get over here.

248
00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:46.529
These guys are trash.

249
00:15:46.729 --> 00:15:48.529
We need a new batch,
and we need it fast.

250
00:15:48.729 --> 00:15:51.009
It's hard.
You've chewed through
most of la.

251
00:15:51.209 --> 00:15:53.839
You want me to pull back?
You know drago
ain't taking it easy.

252
00:15:54.039 --> 00:15:56.759
We're here
to train, we're here
to fight, aren't we?

253
00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:59.079
You taught me that
and that is what
we are going to do.

254
00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:01.149
Okay...

255
00:16:01.349 --> 00:16:03.289
Hey, Felix.
<i>Ven aqui.</i>

256
00:16:03.489 --> 00:16:05.549
What's up, champ?
You wanna help me
with some rounds?

257
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:07.989
What, and mess up this suit?
I don't think so.

258
00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:10.209
I'm trying
to get you paid, Felix.

259
00:16:10.409 --> 00:16:11.995
We can't get you paid
if you keep knocking out

260
00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:13.429
all these sparring partners,
okay?

261
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:15.599
You gotta be ready
to fight drago in four weeks.

262
00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:17.869
You're the champ.
We know you got power.

263
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:19.999
But it's not always about
how hard you can hit.

264
00:16:20.199 --> 00:16:22.349
- It's about control and focus.
- You're right.

265
00:16:22.549 --> 00:16:23.549
Listen to Duke.

266
00:16:25.539 --> 00:16:26.569
Yes, sir.

267
00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:29.489
See? You play too much.

268
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:31.185
- Listen to Duke.
- Did you hear that?

269
00:16:31.209 --> 00:16:33.049
"Listen to Duke."

270
00:16:33.249 --> 00:16:35.879
Those three words.
Not "I love you."

271
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.449
Not "take it easy."
None of that.

272
00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:40.409
"Listen to Duke."

273
00:16:40.609 --> 00:16:43.019
I understand
exactly what they're asking.

274
00:16:43.219 --> 00:16:46.589
Drago's got a bigger name,
that's true,
but Felix got the belt.

275
00:16:46.789 --> 00:16:49.029
His split's got to be bigger.

276
00:16:49.229 --> 00:16:51.469
I don't care
if they don't like it.
Tell drago to call me.

277
00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:54.829
Hey, let me call you right back.

278
00:16:55.479 --> 00:16:56.479
Hey, my man.

279
00:16:57.789 --> 00:16:59.909
Can I help you?

280
00:17:00.109 --> 00:17:02.689
- Let me get an autograph.
- No, I ain't signing
no autographs.

281
00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:03.889
Would you get off my car?

282
00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.579
Oh, homey.

283
00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:10.409
You don't remember me, huh?

284
00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:15.539
You come a long way
from bumming rides
from your mom.

285
00:17:17.149 --> 00:17:19.319
Dame.

286
00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:21.939
Boy, you had me.

287
00:17:22.899 --> 00:17:24.499
Damian.

288
00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:26.109
Yeah, just got back to the hood.

289
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:28.109
Stopped by the old gym,
but, uh...

290
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:30.759
Yeah, we upgraded
a couple years ago, you know?

291
00:17:30.959 --> 00:17:31.959
I see.

292
00:17:34.999 --> 00:17:37.169
- Damn, it's, uh...
- It's been a minute.

293
00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:39.389
Been a minute.

294
00:17:42.699 --> 00:17:44.345
Hey, I don't wanna take up
your time or nothing, man.

295
00:17:44.369 --> 00:17:46.009
I just wanted to let you know
what's good.

296
00:17:46.069 --> 00:17:47.519
I'm around.

297
00:17:47.719 --> 00:17:49.799
If you wanna catch up,
you know,
you just let me know.

298
00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:58.879
Where you about to head now?

299
00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:02.809
Shit, back to the crib.

300
00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:05.449
You got time to get some grub?

301
00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:07.979
Thank you.

302
00:18:08.179 --> 00:18:10.029
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

303
00:18:19.219 --> 00:18:22.479
I'm surprised
you still come here
and eat with the common folk.

304
00:18:23.129 --> 00:18:24.949
I mean, when I can.

305
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:27.509
There's a lot of things
I used to do
that I can't do anymore.

306
00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:28.999
Busy living that high life, huh?

307
00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:30.839
Yeah.
Guess it comes with the job.

308
00:18:32.399 --> 00:18:33.869
All right.

309
00:18:34.069 --> 00:18:36.349
Yo... easy, easy. Damn, bruh.

310
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:38.509
You know how long it's been
since I had this shit?

311
00:18:39.979 --> 00:18:40.979
How long?

312
00:18:41.849 --> 00:18:42.889
Eighteen years, bro.

313
00:18:44.589 --> 00:18:45.899
You've been down
this whole time?

314
00:18:48.939 --> 00:18:52.079
Had a few years tacked on,
but... yeah.

315
00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:55.639
Just got out last week.

316
00:18:56.949 --> 00:18:59.079
Well, congratulations on that.

317
00:19:00.999 --> 00:19:02.039
Thank you.

318
00:19:03.829 --> 00:19:05.179
Wrote you a few times.

319
00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:09.219
- You did?
Where'd you send 'em?
- Mama creed's.

320
00:19:13.139 --> 00:19:14.559
She still up in bel air?

321
00:19:14.759 --> 00:19:16.159
Yeah, she's still there.
Same house.

322
00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:18.099
But I never got 'em.

323
00:19:25.329 --> 00:19:28.659
You know I watched
every one of your fights
in the pen.

324
00:19:28.859 --> 00:19:30.329
You finally
made it to Africa, huh?

325
00:19:31.419 --> 00:19:33.669
- You seen that?
- Saw that.

326
00:19:33.869 --> 00:19:37.059
Made me proud
how you ended your run.

327
00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.619
Look like you still remember
some of them moves
I taught you.

328
00:19:42.209 --> 00:19:43.559
You know what I remember?

329
00:19:45.479 --> 00:19:46.899
You knocking my ass out.

330
00:19:51.129 --> 00:19:52.609
You know what I remember?

331
00:19:54.399 --> 00:19:55.699
Helping your big ass back up.

332
00:19:56.659 --> 00:19:57.749
Remember that?

333
00:19:59.879 --> 00:20:01.539
- Yeah, you did.
- All right, then.

334
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:08.669
You got work?

335
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:13.369
I got plans.

336
00:20:14.809 --> 00:20:17.279
Keep my nose clean.
Keep my po off my ass.

337
00:20:17.479 --> 00:20:18.479
Mm.

338
00:20:23.859 --> 00:20:25.979
Listen, if there's anything
I can do for you,

339
00:20:26.179 --> 00:20:29.519
if I can help at all, just ask.

340
00:20:31.829 --> 00:20:34.129
What am I talking about?
You just came home.

341
00:20:38.749 --> 00:20:41.359
Whatever you need. Aight?
Don't hesitate, bruh.

342
00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:47.399
I'm straight, bro.

343
00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:49.569
I'm good.
I got it all situated.

344
00:20:49.769 --> 00:20:51.659
I ain't come to see you
for no handout.

345
00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:53.499
Nah, I didn't mean it
like that. It was...

346
00:20:55.159 --> 00:20:56.199
Respect.

347
00:21:00.769 --> 00:21:02.539
So, what's the plan?

348
00:21:02.739 --> 00:21:04.059
Same program
last time you saw me.

349
00:21:06.339 --> 00:21:07.779
I wanna be champ.

350
00:21:12.609 --> 00:21:13.769
You still wanna box?

351
00:21:13.969 --> 00:21:15.699
Hey, I know I've been
away a long time.

352
00:21:18.439 --> 00:21:19.479
I kept myself in shape.

353
00:21:20.749 --> 00:21:22.149
I got some moves
you ain't seen yet.

354
00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:23.239
Yeah. You...

355
00:21:25.189 --> 00:21:26.749
- You looking diesel.
- I ain't joking.

356
00:21:27.969 --> 00:21:28.969
I'm ready.

357
00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:31.279
I still got gas in the tank.

358
00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:34.409
And I gotta get me that chain.

359
00:21:36.069 --> 00:21:37.809
Can't be "diamond" dame
looking bummy.

360
00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:40.779
"Diamond" dame.

361
00:21:42.199 --> 00:21:43.199
That's right.

362
00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:51.779
All right.

363
00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:53.689
Come by the gym.

364
00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:55.649
Get you set up with Duke.

365
00:22:00.179 --> 00:22:01.479
- For real?
- Yeah.

366
00:22:03.139 --> 00:22:04.139
For real.

367
00:22:06.229 --> 00:22:07.229
All right, then.

368
00:22:10.189 --> 00:22:11.189
Thank you.

369
00:22:30.819 --> 00:22:32.249
Yo, yo, yo!

370
00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:44.469
What's so funny?

371
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:47.165
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying
to convince your mama
to come live with us,

372
00:22:47.189 --> 00:22:49.429
so I can have
my own live-in braider.

373
00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:54.909
Yeah.
Careful what you wish for.

374
00:22:55.109 --> 00:22:56.869
Oh, I'm not worried.

375
00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:00.269
It's actually not a bad idea.

376
00:23:00.469 --> 00:23:02.439
And how you feeling, mama?
You good?

377
00:23:02.639 --> 00:23:04.919
I'm good.

378
00:23:05.119 --> 00:23:07.009
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

379
00:23:07.209 --> 00:23:08.579
Okay.

380
00:23:08.779 --> 00:23:11.379
I'd be better if my son
showed up on time for dinner.

381
00:23:12.639 --> 00:23:15.889
Ouch. Uh, sorry.

382
00:23:16.089 --> 00:23:17.589
- Mmm.
- I just got caught up.

383
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:18.789
Mm-hmm.

384
00:23:22.259 --> 00:23:24.469
There. Look at that.

385
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:27.869
Who's the real champ
in this family?

386
00:23:30.179 --> 00:23:30.989
You are.

387
00:23:31.189 --> 00:23:33.079
No. You.

388
00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:34.529
Go see for yourself.

389
00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:39.219
Thank you grandma. I love you.

390
00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:40.659
You're welcome.

391
00:23:40.859 --> 00:23:41.999
I love you.

392
00:23:42.199 --> 00:23:43.199
Hey.

393
00:23:43.339 --> 00:23:44.409
No TV.

394
00:23:48.419 --> 00:23:50.319
Fine. I love you.

395
00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:53.899
You're gonna have
your hands full with that one.

396
00:23:54.939 --> 00:23:56.279
We already do.

397
00:23:56.479 --> 00:23:59.249
- No. She's the best.
- Yes, we do.

398
00:23:59.949 --> 00:24:01.019
She is.

399
00:24:01.219 --> 00:24:02.889
- You're the worst.
- Oh, come on, mama.

400
00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:05.370
- You're the worst.
- Stop...
You don't mean it.

401
00:24:06.259 --> 00:24:07.739
- Here, ma.
- Thank you.

402
00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:10.419
B, think that's a good idea?

403
00:24:10.619 --> 00:24:12.029
Baby, not tonight.

404
00:24:12.229 --> 00:24:13.549
But we talked about this.

405
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:15.619
- One thing at a time.
- Okay.

406
00:24:21.099 --> 00:24:24.439
Okay. We are not doing this
this evening, okay?

407
00:24:24.639 --> 00:24:26.319
And just so we're straight

408
00:24:27.449 --> 00:24:29.659
and everybody knows,

409
00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:31.279
I am not leaving my house.

410
00:24:32.329 --> 00:24:33.329
Understood?

411
00:24:33.469 --> 00:24:34.929
Mm-hmm.

412
00:24:35.129 --> 00:24:37.489
- Okay.
- Okay.

413
00:24:37.689 --> 00:24:39.279
And I really am fine.

414
00:24:39.479 --> 00:24:41.979
I promise you,
I am not gonna have
another stroke tonight.

415
00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:43.179
Okay?

416
00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:45.759
Have it tomorrow night.

417
00:24:45.959 --> 00:24:48.329
Mom. That's...

418
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:49.589
That's not funny.

419
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:51.165
It's a little funny.

420
00:24:51.189 --> 00:24:52.859
And you're not helping.

421
00:24:53.059 --> 00:24:55.119
You know
that we're worried about you.

422
00:24:55.319 --> 00:24:56.685
- That's it.
We can leave it now.
- I...

423
00:24:56.709 --> 00:24:58.389
And we wanna be careful
after the last one.

424
00:24:58.959 --> 00:25:00.309
I am fine.

425
00:25:01.229 --> 00:25:02.229
Okay?

426
00:25:05.059 --> 00:25:06.959
But what about you?

427
00:25:07.159 --> 00:25:08.219
What's up with you?

428
00:25:08.419 --> 00:25:10.019
Yeah. Where were you, d?

429
00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:12.889
Just ran into
this guy named dame.

430
00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:15.329
Damian.

431
00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:19.189
Who's he?

432
00:25:24.899 --> 00:25:27.909
Think you might've
checked with me?
This ain't no damn charity.

433
00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:31.769
And homey older than you.

434
00:25:31.969 --> 00:25:34.529
I'm just trying
to give him a break.
Isn't that what we do anyway?

435
00:25:34.709 --> 00:25:37.209
No! This ain't the ymca.

436
00:25:37.409 --> 00:25:38.769
Look around, Duke.

437
00:25:38.969 --> 00:25:41.169
You see anybody lining up
to get in the ring with Felix?

438
00:25:41.829 --> 00:25:44.259
All I'm saying is, let him spar.

439
00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:47.649
Felix got a fight coming up,
and we have zero bodies.

440
00:25:47.849 --> 00:25:50.005
I mean, absolutely nobody
wants to get in the ring
with Felix.

441
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:51.229
I know what you doin', Donnie.

442
00:25:52.369 --> 00:25:54.319
You don't owe this dude shit.

443
00:25:56.019 --> 00:25:57.109
Nothing.

444
00:25:59.019 --> 00:26:00.019
But let's spar.

445
00:26:00.939 --> 00:26:01.939
Let's do it.

446
00:26:04.679 --> 00:26:06.449
Felix, Felix, yo. Listen up.

447
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:08.329
Adonis brought somebody in
for you to spar.

448
00:26:09.429 --> 00:26:11.469
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

449
00:26:12.599 --> 00:26:14.259
- Huh?
- We on.

450
00:26:21.129 --> 00:26:22.309
Lot of young cats in here.

451
00:26:23.479 --> 00:26:24.529
Young man's game.

452
00:26:26.179 --> 00:26:27.859
Don't worry,
Duke's gonna take care of you.

453
00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:31.219
We back to ground zero.

454
00:26:31.419 --> 00:26:32.969
Champs gotta start somewhere,
right?

455
00:26:39.629 --> 00:26:41.439
All right.

456
00:26:41.639 --> 00:26:45.509
Felix, meet Damian.
He gonna spar with you.

457
00:26:46.899 --> 00:26:48.459
You still remember
how to do that, yeah?

458
00:26:49.899 --> 00:26:51.719
You got this.

459
00:26:51.919 --> 00:26:54.779
Felix, stay focused.
Work on timing.
That's all we need.

460
00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:15.059
Why's this kid picking on her?

461
00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:16.839
Well, I'm just asking.

462
00:27:18.099 --> 00:27:19.929
Sign.

463
00:27:21.189 --> 00:27:22.189
I'm sorry.

464
00:27:22.339 --> 00:27:23.399
I think...

465
00:27:23.599 --> 00:27:27.059
She probably wants
to get some attention -

466
00:27:27.259 --> 00:27:29.939
hold on. Why is my daughter
in trouble and not her?

467
00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:33.339
She can't protect herself?

468
00:27:35.119 --> 00:27:38.149
Obviously we're concerned
about Amara.

469
00:27:38.349 --> 00:27:40.419
Feeling comfortable here
is important.

470
00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:42.329
Of course.

471
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:46.389
But we understand fighting
isn't the way to handle things.

472
00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:50.119
Mm-hmm.

473
00:27:50.319 --> 00:27:54.519
Look, we love Amara.

474
00:27:54.719 --> 00:27:58.519
She's an academically
exceptional child...

475
00:27:58.719 --> 00:27:59.719
She's thriving.

476
00:27:59.849 --> 00:28:03.229
She just... fights.

477
00:28:05.889 --> 00:28:08.359
So, you wanna
teach her how to fight?
That's your advice?

478
00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:10.599
I didn't think I had to,
at a deaf school like that,

479
00:28:10.729 --> 00:28:13.009
- but maybe I was wrong.
- Wait.

480
00:28:13.209 --> 00:28:16.889
What does that mean,
"at a deaf school like that,"
like they're not still kids?

481
00:28:17.089 --> 00:28:18.539
I mean,
what did you expect, Adonis?

482
00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:20.455
Then she should learn
how to defend herself.

483
00:28:20.479 --> 00:28:21.935
Okay, first of all,
I'm not saying that

484
00:28:21.959 --> 00:28:23.505
she shouldn't know
how to defend herself.

485
00:28:23.529 --> 00:28:24.969
I'm just saying
what that means to me

486
00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:26.769
is different
than what it means to you.

487
00:28:26.969 --> 00:28:30.419
What if she's someplace
she's supposed to be safe,
and she's not?

488
00:28:30.619 --> 00:28:32.099
She won't know
how to protect herself.

489
00:28:33.309 --> 00:28:34.309
Where's that coming from?

490
00:28:35.829 --> 00:28:38.269
Nowhere. It's just a fact.

491
00:28:39.659 --> 00:28:41.299
Okay.

492
00:28:41.499 --> 00:28:43.349
Another fact is that,
I think, as parents,

493
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:44.829
it's actually our responsibility

494
00:28:44.939 --> 00:28:46.919
to teach her
how to assess her emotions.

495
00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:49.959
So you want Amara, right,
to hold hands with this bully

496
00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:51.789
and start talking
about her feelings?

497
00:28:51.989 --> 00:28:52.989
That's not real life.

498
00:28:53.119 --> 00:28:54.619
Okay, what do you
want her to do?

499
00:28:54.819 --> 00:28:56.755
You want her
to never talk about
her feelings to anyone?

500
00:28:56.779 --> 00:29:01.369
Not even to us,
and all she can do
about them is to hit somebody?

501
00:29:01.569 --> 00:29:03.545
Look,
I know that you think that
that has worked for you,

502
00:29:03.569 --> 00:29:05.369
but now that you don't have
an outlet anymore,

503
00:29:05.439 --> 00:29:07.719
you should think about
maybe talking
about how you feel.

504
00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:09.899
If not to me, to somebody.

505
00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:11.739
Or, I don't know, d.
Get a hobby.

506
00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:14.509
- Okay, I'll get a hobby.
- Oh, yeah?

507
00:29:14.709 --> 00:29:16.559
Yeah, you.

508
00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:18.685
I'ma go down to the studio.
I'ma start
laying tracks with you.

509
00:29:18.709 --> 00:29:21.559
That's not funny, d.

510
00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:24.739
Look,
I know that you think that
you are protecting her, baby,

511
00:29:24.939 --> 00:29:28.659
but she has got to know why
she wants to fight,
not just how to do it.

512
00:29:28.859 --> 00:29:31.315
And the only solution
to every problem
is not a punch in the face.

513
00:29:31.339 --> 00:29:33.269
Yeah, you're right.
And sometimes it is.

514
00:29:38.329 --> 00:29:40.209
All right,
let's just have a good time.

515
00:29:42.599 --> 00:29:44.579
Okay,
I see you made it all right.

516
00:29:44.779 --> 00:29:47.239
Oh, yeah. I just asked him,
"where the black family
live at?"

517
00:29:48.959 --> 00:29:50.499
- I'm kidding.
- Yeah.

518
00:29:50.699 --> 00:29:51.719
- What's up, man?
- 'Sup?

519
00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:53.849
There's other ones around.

520
00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:55.459
I ain't see none. Here you go.

521
00:29:55.659 --> 00:29:56.899
Thank you.

522
00:29:57.099 --> 00:29:58.779
- Nice to meet you, Ms. Bianca.
- Pleasure.

523
00:29:58.969 --> 00:30:01.249
- You never bought me
no flowers.
- What, you want a kiss?

524
00:30:01.449 --> 00:30:04.039
- Nah. I'm okay.
No, no, it's all right.
- Come here.

525
00:30:04.239 --> 00:30:06.649
- Hey, y'all got a beautiful home.
- - Thank you.

526
00:30:06.849 --> 00:30:09.909
Hey... dinner time.

527
00:30:10.109 --> 00:30:11.589
You got the see-through floors?

528
00:30:13.059 --> 00:30:14.099
Oh.

529
00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:17.369
Whoa. All right.

530
00:30:18.369 --> 00:30:19.539
Amara.

531
00:30:21.159 --> 00:30:22.329
- Amara?
- Mm-hmm.

532
00:30:23.329 --> 00:30:26.379
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

533
00:30:28.419 --> 00:30:29.899
Nice to meet you.

534
00:30:31.249 --> 00:30:32.979
She says, "you too."

535
00:30:33.179 --> 00:30:34.179
Ah, hell yeah.

536
00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:36.389
Need water?

537
00:30:40.169 --> 00:30:41.259
Thank you again.

538
00:30:42.699 --> 00:30:43.819
Thank you very much.

539
00:30:44.019 --> 00:30:45.649
Dawg,
I still can't get over this.

540
00:30:45.849 --> 00:30:48.129
This square
got him a whole mansion.

541
00:30:48.329 --> 00:30:51.089
Married a... a genuine rock star.

542
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:52.579
- Yeah, I did.
- Mmm.

543
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:55.739
How many gold records you got?

544
00:30:55.939 --> 00:30:57.835
- I have a few.
- She bein' modest.

545
00:30:57.859 --> 00:30:59.659
She bein' real modest.

546
00:30:59.859 --> 00:31:03.359
No, but it's mostly
artists I produce,
but, yeah, I got some.

547
00:31:03.559 --> 00:31:05.839
- And she produces?
- She does.

548
00:31:06.039 --> 00:31:09.189
Donnie. You punching up.

549
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:11.979
So, Ms. Producer,
when's your next show?

550
00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:14.539
I don't really
perform like that these days.

551
00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:16.759
Yeah, I took a break,
'cause I was...

552
00:31:16.959 --> 00:31:19.769
I was having some issues
with my hearing on stage.

553
00:31:19.969 --> 00:31:22.329
Now I'm trying to be careful
and preserve
what I've got left,

554
00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:24.609
so, I'm producing.

555
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:27.469
Yeah.

556
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:29.179
Not any time soon.

557
00:31:31.439 --> 00:31:34.389
Still hard
to give that part up, though.
Right?

558
00:31:34.589 --> 00:31:37.999
Yeah. It's not
the only thing I love,
but it takes work.

559
00:31:38.199 --> 00:31:39.695
- It's an adjustment...
- Mm-hmm.

560
00:31:39.719 --> 00:31:40.875
For the both of us.

561
00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:43.789
So, how long
have you known each other?

562
00:31:43.989 --> 00:31:46.139
- I mean...
- We go back. Way back.

563
00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:50.319
We was like...
We was like brothers.

564
00:31:50.519 --> 00:31:52.329
Shared a room for two years
at the Jeff.

565
00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:55.759
Yeah, something like that.

566
00:31:55.959 --> 00:31:58.065
You know how it went.
He went off
and got all Hollywood.

567
00:31:58.089 --> 00:31:59.329
The Jeff, right.

568
00:31:59.529 --> 00:32:00.599
Yeah, the group home.

569
00:32:02.469 --> 00:32:03.819
You remember them bedbugs?

570
00:32:05.869 --> 00:32:07.159
I try to forget 'em.

571
00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:08.479
Yeah.

572
00:32:10.739 --> 00:32:12.139
I can't forget them bugs.

573
00:32:15.139 --> 00:32:17.209
- I'm gonna get her to bed.
- Okay.

574
00:32:17.409 --> 00:32:19.959
- You two stay, catch up.
- Okay.

575
00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:21.959
Oh, invite him
to the label party.

576
00:32:22.159 --> 00:32:23.479
- Definitely will do that.
- Yeah.

577
00:32:23.589 --> 00:32:25.609
I heard that. I'm invited
to the label party.

578
00:32:27.209 --> 00:32:28.315
- You're invited.
- Thank you.

579
00:32:28.339 --> 00:32:30.579
Yeah.
Thank you so much for coming.

580
00:32:30.779 --> 00:32:33.849
- Yeah, no doubt.
My pleasure to meet you.
- Mmm.

581
00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:45.029
I can't believe
you moved back out here
to the boonies.

582
00:32:45.229 --> 00:32:47.379
You used to love
coming out to the hood.
Now you all...

583
00:32:47.579 --> 00:32:49.459
What?

584
00:32:49.659 --> 00:32:51.599
- Domesticated and shit.
- Ah, come on, man.

585
00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:53.865
See what happens
when you get married.

586
00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:55.509
- Yeah, all right, bro.
- Aight?

587
00:32:55.709 --> 00:32:58.309
- The women run this household.
- I just live here.

588
00:32:59.529 --> 00:33:02.189
That's what happens, man.
You get married, a family.

589
00:33:02.879 --> 00:33:03.929
It's crazy.

590
00:33:07.019 --> 00:33:08.059
Pour up.

591
00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:22.549
Can't believe you traded it in
for a monkey suit.

592
00:33:24.989 --> 00:33:27.559
Oh, you know,
a suit has some advantages.

593
00:33:34.649 --> 00:33:37.509
You saying that
like I got soft
or something, like...

594
00:33:37.709 --> 00:33:39.685
- Like I lost this
sneak-attack.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

595
00:33:39.709 --> 00:33:41.789
Okay, I see.
The champ's still got
some pepper in him.

596
00:33:41.979 --> 00:33:44.709
All I'm saying is,
I left boxing,
but boxing didn't leave me.

597
00:33:46.709 --> 00:33:48.009
See,
that's what I'm saying, bro.

598
00:33:49.929 --> 00:33:53.479
I mean, look,
I know you got a ship to run,
and whatnot,

599
00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:54.965
but I ain't keep
my stuff together

600
00:33:54.989 --> 00:33:56.709
just to be some punching bag
for some chump.

601
00:33:57.329 --> 00:33:58.399
You feel me?

602
00:33:58.599 --> 00:34:00.639
Don't sleep on Felix. Aight?

603
00:34:02.249 --> 00:34:03.859
He got it the hard way.
He earned it.

604
00:34:05.379 --> 00:34:06.989
I did 18 years
the hard way, bro.

605
00:34:11.519 --> 00:34:13.039
Maybe I ain't make myself clear.

606
00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:17.739
I want a title shot.

607
00:34:18.519 --> 00:34:20.469
Dame...

608
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:23.035
I don't know
what you think,
but it don't work like that.

609
00:34:23.059 --> 00:34:25.909
Felix so cold,
what he got to lose?
What you got to lose?

610
00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:28.305
You think I can snap
my fingers and make you
a contender overnight?

611
00:34:28.329 --> 00:34:29.609
Ain't that what happened to you?

612
00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:40.239
It's like this, bro.

613
00:34:42.939 --> 00:34:43.939
I respect you...

614
00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:48.099
But my clock tickin'.

615
00:34:48.299 --> 00:34:50.719
It's now or never for me.

616
00:34:50.919 --> 00:34:53.509
And I wanna help you,
like I said I would.

617
00:34:55.039 --> 00:34:57.169
But, man,
what you asking me, it's...

618
00:34:59.219 --> 00:35:00.219
It's kinda impossible.

619
00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:06.529
You don't know
what it's like, bro.

620
00:35:09.489 --> 00:35:10.569
All that time in them...

621
00:35:12.489 --> 00:35:13.529
In them walls.

622
00:35:18.629 --> 00:35:19.669
Impossible?

623
00:35:22.589 --> 00:35:23.629
They take your name.

624
00:35:24.459 --> 00:35:25.809
And they give you a number.

625
00:35:28.899 --> 00:35:29.899
That's how it start.

626
00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:34.289
I was the best, though.

627
00:35:34.989 --> 00:35:36.039
Yeah, you were.

628
00:35:36.989 --> 00:35:38.079
I was, bro.

629
00:35:40.039 --> 00:35:41.559
But I never got a chance
to prove that.

630
00:35:43.479 --> 00:35:45.949
Look, all I'm saying, bro, if...

631
00:35:46.149 --> 00:35:50.309
If Apollo creed
could take a chance
on some underdog...

632
00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:53.099
Why can't you?

633
00:36:06.239 --> 00:36:07.279
Did you sleep okay?

634
00:36:09.549 --> 00:36:11.059
Mm-hmm.

635
00:36:11.259 --> 00:36:12.739
You were grinding your teeth.

636
00:36:15.249 --> 00:36:16.729
How was the rest of last night?

637
00:36:17.549 --> 00:36:19.279
Mm...

638
00:36:19.479 --> 00:36:22.109
- It was, uh... it was good.
- Yeah?

639
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:23.519
Just catching up.

640
00:36:25.779 --> 00:36:27.859
Hey,
why didn't you ever tell me
about the group home?

641
00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:33.479
There wasn't a lot to say.

642
00:36:36.269 --> 00:36:37.309
Hmm.

643
00:36:38.139 --> 00:36:39.489
How old were you?

644
00:36:42.359 --> 00:36:44.539
Uh, I was around Amara's age.

645
00:36:48.759 --> 00:36:50.019
You don't wanna talk about it?

646
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:52.759
It's okay.

647
00:36:55.549 --> 00:36:56.719
- No.
- It's okay.

648
00:36:58.769 --> 00:36:59.769
Nah, it's dame.

649
00:37:01.509 --> 00:37:03.079
You know he asked me
to fight Felix?

650
00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:06.679
- For real?
- Yeah.

651
00:37:06.879 --> 00:37:09.609
Heavyweight champion
of the world,
and he wants a shot.

652
00:37:10.129 --> 00:37:11.169
So what'd you say?

653
00:37:12.779 --> 00:37:13.819
I said no.

654
00:37:14.019 --> 00:37:15.989
It's impossible, you know?

655
00:37:16.189 --> 00:37:18.189
People wait their whole lives
for a shot like that.

656
00:37:18.279 --> 00:37:19.749
- And he's not even a pro.
- Yeah.

657
00:37:22.449 --> 00:37:24.409
Why does it look like
you're still considering it?

658
00:37:28.639 --> 00:37:31.009
Right. All right.
Work him against the ropes.

659
00:37:31.209 --> 00:37:33.729
Work him.
Stay in front of him, baby.
Cut off that ring. Come on.

660
00:37:34.759 --> 00:37:36.749
Oof.

661
00:37:36.949 --> 00:37:38.199
That's right.

662
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:42.309
Don't look at me, man.
You on your own in there.
Let's go.

663
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:43.669
Come on, <i>mijo,</i>stay on him.

664
00:37:43.869 --> 00:37:45.079
Keep fighting. Let's go.

665
00:37:45.949 --> 00:37:46.949
Okay.

666
00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:50.635
Okay, baby, come on. Come on.

667
00:37:50.659 --> 00:37:51.659
Okay.

668
00:37:52.259 --> 00:37:53.259
Let's go, grandpa.

669
00:37:54.129 --> 00:37:55.129
Not enough.

670
00:37:58.219 --> 00:37:59.789
Stay focused. Jabs, jabs.

671
00:38:01.179 --> 00:38:02.729
Give it to him.

672
00:38:02.929 --> 00:38:04.569
Work yourself out the clinch.
Let's do it.

673
00:38:06.449 --> 00:38:08.609
- Hey! You keep it clean, huh?
- What was that? Hey.

674
00:38:08.809 --> 00:38:11.389
Yo, man.
What you trying to do,
hurt me?

675
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:14.919
- Walk it off. Little man,
you ain't built like that.
- Who you calling "little man"?

676
00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:16.119
This is my gym, bro.

677
00:38:16.299 --> 00:38:17.339
All right, coz. All right!

678
00:38:17.509 --> 00:38:18.789
Get in there.

679
00:38:18.989 --> 00:38:19.989
Hey, hey, hey.

680
00:38:21.239 --> 00:38:23.359
Nah.
Get back, Damian. Let him go.

681
00:38:23.559 --> 00:38:25.319
Hey!
What's going on down here?

682
00:38:25.519 --> 00:38:26.519
That was intentional.

683
00:38:26.699 --> 00:38:28.669
- You handle this.
- I am gonna handle this.

684
00:38:28.869 --> 00:38:30.245
D, talk to me. What happened?

685
00:38:30.269 --> 00:38:31.269
Me doing my job.

686
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:33.199
Hey, come here, man.

687
00:38:33.399 --> 00:38:36.029
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.
Use your head. Okay?

688
00:38:36.229 --> 00:38:38.149
Use your head. Leave all that
other mess outside.

689
00:38:39.039 --> 00:38:40.829
I told you what I want, d.

690
00:38:42.049 --> 00:38:43.555
And I told you
it was gonna take some time.

691
00:38:43.579 --> 00:38:44.579
All right.

692
00:38:45.569 --> 00:38:47.489
All right? Go take a walk.

693
00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:49.179
Get some air.

694
00:38:49.619 --> 00:38:50.659
Aight?

695
00:38:52.319 --> 00:38:53.349
Hey, Adonis.

696
00:38:53.549 --> 00:38:54.739
No... hey, Duke. Calm down.

697
00:38:54.939 --> 00:38:56.225
- This was a mistake.
- I got it under control.

698
00:38:56.249 --> 00:38:57.485
I told you right away
it was a mistake.

699
00:38:57.509 --> 00:38:59.569
- I got it.
- You don't!

700
00:38:59.769 --> 00:39:01.755
You let him come in here
with a chip on his shoulder.

701
00:39:01.779 --> 00:39:02.969
That's exactly...

702
00:39:03.169 --> 00:39:05.189
- Well,
don't get quiet now, dukie.
- Man...

703
00:39:05.389 --> 00:39:09.899
It's okay.
Relax. I know, I got you.
I know. Just let it go. Okay?

704
00:39:11.859 --> 00:39:12.859
I got it under control.

705
00:39:14.209 --> 00:39:16.039
He's telling you
who he is, right?

706
00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:17.779
Believe him.

707
00:40:30.199 --> 00:40:32.189
What you up to, rascal?

708
00:40:32.389 --> 00:40:33.979
Oh, I was...

709
00:40:34.679 --> 00:40:37.449
I was cleaning.

710
00:40:37.649 --> 00:40:39.639
That's not what
uncle Duke told me...

711
00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:46.289
I don't want to get in trouble.

712
00:40:46.489 --> 00:40:48.219
Mom doesn't want me to fight.

713
00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:54.429
How 'bout
it's our little secret?

714
00:40:54.629 --> 00:40:55.909
Yes!

715
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:58.079
Want me to show you
all the other stuff?

716
00:40:58.279 --> 00:40:59.279
Yes!

717
00:41:05.679 --> 00:41:07.529
That's called a straight right.

718
00:41:07.729 --> 00:41:09.669
That's how you
knocked out Wheeler?

719
00:41:10.459 --> 00:41:11.889
Who taught you that?

720
00:41:13.199 --> 00:41:14.199
You.

721
00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:16.289
You watched that fight?

722
00:41:18.329 --> 00:41:22.469
I've watched all your fights.

723
00:41:24.379 --> 00:41:26.299
Show me something else.

724
00:41:28.599 --> 00:41:32.419
Most people think
it's about violence
but it's not.

725
00:41:32.619 --> 00:41:35.159
It's timing and focus and...

726
00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:36.659
Control?

727
00:41:59.419 --> 00:42:01.929
Perfect.

739

Can I get
two scotches on the rocks?
All right, thank you.

740
00:42:57.169 --> 00:42:58.169
'Sup, Donnie?

741
00:43:00.519 --> 00:43:01.649
I would've had you.

742
00:43:04.089 --> 00:43:06.959
Okay, maybe not.

743
00:43:08.659 --> 00:43:12.089
- You look all right.
- You know. You too.

744
00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:14.059
- A sweater.
- I'm... just glad you came.

745
00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:17.129
B invited.

746
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:18.409
True.

747
00:43:21.029 --> 00:43:22.329
Hey, don't worry about them.

748
00:43:22.939 --> 00:43:23.969
I ain't.

749
00:43:24.169 --> 00:43:26.229
It's a party. Have fun.

750
00:43:26.429 --> 00:43:28.549
So many other things in here
you should be looking at.

751
00:43:31.379 --> 00:43:32.949
It's a fire party, bro. Yeah.

752
00:43:34.379 --> 00:43:35.469
Congrats, boy.

753
00:43:38.129 --> 00:43:39.159
You made it.

754
00:43:39.359 --> 00:43:41.679
Now those two: Chavez, drago.

755
00:43:41.879 --> 00:43:43.799
I'm gonna make sure
that's the fight of the year.

756
00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:46.609
Hey, you okay?

757
00:43:48.699 --> 00:43:49.979
I don't need
no babysitting, bro.

758
00:43:50.959 --> 00:43:52.259
Aight. I'ma be right back.

759
00:43:52.459 --> 00:43:53.459
Go ahead.

760
00:43:55.529 --> 00:43:56.829
Look at my two killers.

761
00:43:57.029 --> 00:43:58.359
I can't wait
to get this thing...

762
00:44:02.409 --> 00:44:03.699
Are you ready to do this?

763
00:44:03.899 --> 00:44:05.615
You know I'm always ready.
You don't have to ask.

764
00:44:05.639 --> 00:44:07.399
Okay. Save it for fight night.

765
00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:10.839
We got the venue.
We got the money.
We're gonna break records.

766
00:44:11.039 --> 00:44:12.799
Will you send me
the tracks, please?

767
00:44:12.909 --> 00:44:14.189
I can't wait to hear them.

768
00:44:14.389 --> 00:44:15.805
We'll talk next week.
It was so nice to meet you.

769
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:17.079
Congratulations too.

770
00:44:17.689 --> 00:44:18.989
You made it.

771
00:44:19.819 --> 00:44:21.419
- Yep.
- Thank you for coming.

772
00:44:21.619 --> 00:44:22.649
You having fun?

773
00:44:23.649 --> 00:44:24.679
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

774
00:44:24.879 --> 00:44:26.509
- Yeah.
- Good. Me too.

775
00:44:26.709 --> 00:44:28.729
I'm tired of
working the room, but...

776
00:44:28.929 --> 00:44:30.249
It's what you do.

777
00:44:30.449 --> 00:44:32.339
Yeah, sometimes.

778
00:44:32.539 --> 00:44:34.255
- Guess that's what y'all do.
- Look at him over there.

779
00:44:34.279 --> 00:44:35.649
Getting his Don King on.

780
00:44:35.849 --> 00:44:37.299
Minus the hair.

781
00:44:37.499 --> 00:44:38.915
- Thank god.
- Yeah.

782
00:44:38.939 --> 00:44:40.219
You know, that's growth for him.

783
00:44:40.369 --> 00:44:42.189
He used to hate
coming to these things.

784
00:44:43.319 --> 00:44:44.369
So...

785
00:44:45.889 --> 00:44:47.959
- How does it feel?
- What's that?

786
00:44:48.159 --> 00:44:49.445
Having somebody else
sing your song?

787
00:44:49.469 --> 00:44:50.469
Mmm.

788
00:44:51.419 --> 00:44:53.189
It feels good.

789
00:44:53.389 --> 00:44:56.119
I mean,
if it's gotta be anybody,
not bad.

790
00:44:57.249 --> 00:44:58.449
Yeah, I almost believe you.

791
00:45:01.639 --> 00:45:03.859
How about Donnie?
Think he misses boxing?

792
00:45:04.859 --> 00:45:06.469
No. Not that he tells me.

793
00:45:08.169 --> 00:45:09.259
But would he?

794
00:45:13.529 --> 00:45:16.249
Speaking of,
you know, there's something
I wanted to ask you actually.

795
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:19.229
Curious what happened
with you two.

796
00:45:21.049 --> 00:45:22.435
Oh, you wanna know
how I got locked up.

797
00:45:22.459 --> 00:45:24.089
Yeah.

798
00:45:24.289 --> 00:45:25.479
Boring story really.

799
00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:26.929
Got into a fight.

800
00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:29.719
I had a few priors.

801
00:45:30.669 --> 00:45:31.799
Pulled a gun.

802
00:45:33.499 --> 00:45:35.099
Donnie was there.
He can tell you.

803
00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:36.579
You know.

804
00:45:36.779 --> 00:45:38.029
Donnie pop off...

805
00:45:40.859 --> 00:45:43.339
And I ain't even saying
dude ain't deserve it, but...

806
00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:45.119
Who is "dude"?

807
00:45:50.779 --> 00:45:52.349
Okay. Uh...

808
00:45:53.999 --> 00:45:55.219
His name was Leon.

809
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:59.349
The rest of it,
we gonna leave
to Donnie to tell you.

810
00:46:00.089 --> 00:46:02.099
Ain't really my place.
Feel me?

811
00:46:04.229 --> 00:46:05.389
But it's like you say.

812
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:07.829
You know, it take work
to look at the past.

813
00:46:08.029 --> 00:46:09.655
- Yo, stop him.
- Drago!

814
00:46:09.679 --> 00:46:12.219
Hey, hey, get that guy!

815
00:46:16.779 --> 00:46:19.579
<i>The LAPD took this man,
Luis camino, into custody...</i>

816
00:46:19.779 --> 00:46:21.749
No.

817
00:46:21.949 --> 00:46:23.969
No, we're not
canceling anything.

818
00:46:24.169 --> 00:46:25.629
He's seeing a specialist
right now.

819
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:30.019
They're saying...
At least six months.

820
00:46:30.219 --> 00:46:31.779
I know. I know.
But we'll figure it out.

821
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:33.129
Do not move the date.

822
00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:35.159
All right. All right. Bye.

823
00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:36.809
<i>High-profile event.</i>

824
00:46:37.009 --> 00:46:39.209
<i>Drago, who's currently
recovering at cedars-sinai,</i>

825
00:46:39.409 --> 00:46:41.119
<i>suffered a concussion,</i>

826
00:46:41.319 --> 00:46:43.689
<i>as well as multiple fractures
to his right arm and hand.</i>

827
00:46:43.889 --> 00:46:46.259
<i>And his injuries
now throw into doubt</i>

828
00:46:46.459 --> 00:46:48.039
<i>his participation
in next month's...</i>

829
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:50.605
<i>Highly-anticipated title fight</i>

830
00:46:50.629 --> 00:46:52.089
<i>- against Felix Chavez.</i>
- Hello?

831
00:46:52.289 --> 00:46:53.829
Yes,
everything is gonna be fine.

832
00:46:54.029 --> 00:46:55.909
We'll figure it out.
We'll find another fighter.

833
00:46:55.989 --> 00:46:58.269
It's not about just finding
another fighter.

834
00:46:58.469 --> 00:47:00.789
I know, and I understand
your frustrations.
I really do.

835
00:47:00.989 --> 00:47:01.789
So, what are you gonna do?

836
00:47:01.989 --> 00:47:04.059
He wants to fight drago.

837
00:47:04.259 --> 00:47:06.889
But we can't wait six months
for him to be cleared.

838
00:47:07.089 --> 00:47:10.289
These windows
don't last forever.
We need to get him paid now.

839
00:47:12.859 --> 00:47:16.239
All right, there's one,
maybe two other contenders
outside of drago.

840
00:47:16.439 --> 00:47:18.419
There's Ortiz,
and then there's sporino.

841
00:47:18.619 --> 00:47:20.419
And he's recovering
from his last fight.

842
00:47:20.619 --> 00:47:21.619
Okay, so then who?

843
00:47:28.009 --> 00:47:30.519
I got an idea.

844
00:47:30.719 --> 00:47:34.399
It's risky,
but if we pull it off,
it'll be a payday.

845
00:47:35.409 --> 00:47:36.479
What do you have in mind?

846
00:47:36.679 --> 00:47:37.759
He wants you to fight dame.

847
00:47:37.859 --> 00:47:39.479
Dame?

848
00:47:39.679 --> 00:47:41.529
He's not even a real fighter.

849
00:47:41.729 --> 00:47:43.879
He was real enough
when he was sparring with you.

850
00:47:44.079 --> 00:47:45.079
Hey, Felix, people talk.

851
00:47:45.249 --> 00:47:47.269
Champ, he's older than you.

852
00:47:47.469 --> 00:47:48.929
- Huh?
- You're right.

853
00:47:49.129 --> 00:47:52.059
But dame
will fight tooth and nail.

854
00:47:52.259 --> 00:47:53.889
Right now,
we gotta think
outside the box.

855
00:47:56.169 --> 00:47:57.629
Oh, you don't like it, huh?

856
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:59.369
Damian ain't a boxer.

857
00:47:59.569 --> 00:48:00.945
He's fighting the world
and he's trying
to hurt people.

858
00:48:00.969 --> 00:48:02.769
No, I don't like it.
I think it'd be a circus.

859
00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:06.339
What he means is
he's gonna put on a show.
Okay?

860
00:48:06.539 --> 00:48:08.339
We gotta play the cards
that we're dealt.

861
00:48:08.539 --> 00:48:10.949
But the thing here is,
will people come?

862
00:48:11.149 --> 00:48:14.209
Oh, people are gonna show up.
I can promise you that.

863
00:48:14.409 --> 00:48:17.089
Everyone loves
an underdog story.

864
00:48:17.289 --> 00:48:21.529
You know
how many people tuned in
when Apollo gave rocky a shot?

865
00:48:21.729 --> 00:48:23.889
People are still talking
about that fight today.

866
00:48:24.669 --> 00:48:26.569
Champ, listen.

867
00:48:26.769 --> 00:48:29.969
I know it's not
what we promised, okay?
I understand.

868
00:48:30.169 --> 00:48:33.289
But if it was me, I'd do it.

869
00:48:36.209 --> 00:48:37.409
What do you think?

870
00:48:38.599 --> 00:48:39.729
Do you trust him?

871
00:48:40.689 --> 00:48:42.369
Yes, of course.

872
00:48:42.569 --> 00:48:44.039
Ok so let's go.

873
00:48:45.169 --> 00:48:46.349
Let's do it.

874
00:48:46.959 --> 00:48:48.339
Just let your boy know,

875
00:48:48.539 --> 00:48:50.099
i'ma beat his ass
when I'm in that ring.

876
00:48:50.229 --> 00:48:53.699
Felix, all I want you to do
is your job.

877
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:56.789
- Hmm?
- Let's get it.

878
00:49:03.099 --> 00:49:05.829
<i>Since taking over
the famous delphi academy</i>

879
00:49:06.029 --> 00:49:09.229
<i>with his longtime trainer,</i>
<i>and partner,</i>
<i>"little" Duke Burton,</i>

880
00:49:09.429 --> 00:49:11.919
<i>Adonis creed
has trained and mentored</i>

881
00:49:12.119 --> 00:49:14.359
<i>the next generation
of boxing legends.</i>

882
00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:17.969
Adonis always looked out.
We family.

883
00:49:18.169 --> 00:49:21.059
<i>But the brightest Jewel
in creed athletics' crown</i>

884
00:49:21.259 --> 00:49:23.509
<i>is undoubtedly Felix Chavez.</i>

885
00:49:26.299 --> 00:49:29.459
<i>I go in there
like if I'm a warrior.</i>

886
00:49:29.659 --> 00:49:32.249
<i>And until I take you out,
I'm not gonna stop.</i>

887
00:49:32.449 --> 00:49:35.209
Me and my mother,
we wanna build a legacy,
just like they did.

888
00:49:35.409 --> 00:49:36.859
I had my time as a fighter.

889
00:49:37.059 --> 00:49:38.219
Felix is the next generation.

890
00:49:40.409 --> 00:49:42.345
<i>I'm just excited</i>
<i>I get a chance</i>
<i>to see the fireworks up close.</i>

891
00:49:42.369 --> 00:49:44.169
<i>Boy is explosive.</i>

892
00:49:44.369 --> 00:49:47.519
<i>Now, creed</i>
<i>is staking his reputation</i>
<i>and legacy</i>

893
00:49:47.719 --> 00:49:50.829
<i>on an unlikely new opponent
for Chavez.</i>

894
00:49:51.029 --> 00:49:52.659
<i>Shit, man.
Before I got locked up,</i>

895
00:49:52.859 --> 00:49:55.579
<i>I was</i>
<i>the highest-ranking amateur</i>
<i>in boxing.</i>

896
00:49:57.389 --> 00:49:58.449
Ever.

897
00:49:58.649 --> 00:50:00.049
<i>"Diamond" Damian Anderson</i>

898
00:50:00.129 --> 00:50:02.409
<i>was once a heralded
golden gloves champion</i>

899
00:50:02.609 --> 00:50:05.799
<i>from the crenshaw district
of Los Angeles, California.</i>

900
00:50:05.999 --> 00:50:08.679
<i>But after almost two decades
behind bars,</i>

901
00:50:08.879 --> 00:50:11.639
<i>he's only now making
his professional debut.</i>

902
00:50:11.839 --> 00:50:15.249
It's the longest hiatus
in the history of boxing
'cause I'm back now.

903
00:50:15.449 --> 00:50:18.119
<i>The future of two fighters
hangs in the balance.</i>

904
00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:22.519
<i>Creed athletics is promoting</i>
<i>the most surprising fight</i>
<i>of the year.</i>

905
00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:26.359
<i>Will it be a cinderella story,</i>
<i>or another notch</i>
<i>on the champion's belt?</i>

906
00:50:29.619 --> 00:50:31.305
<i>Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

907
00:50:31.329 --> 00:50:33.529
<i>and welcome
to the crypto. Com arena</i>

908
00:50:33.729 --> 00:50:37.049
<i>for tonight's main event.</i>

909
00:50:37.249 --> 00:50:42.059
<i>The stars are arriving</i>

910
00:50:42.259 --> 00:50:45.279
<i>brought to you</i>
<i>by showtime</i>
<i>and creed athletics,</i>

911
00:50:45.479 --> 00:50:49.279
<i>between the reigning</i>
<i>wbc heavyweight champion,</i>
<i>Felix Chavez,</i>

912
00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:53.259
<i>and the virtually</i>
<i>unknown challenger,</i>
<i>Damian Anderson.</i>

913
00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:01.229
- All right, let's go.
- Mm-hmm.

914
00:51:13.009 --> 00:51:14.359
Yeah.

915
00:51:16.759 --> 00:51:17.759
Gentlemen.

916
00:51:17.949 --> 00:51:18.949
Creed.

917
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:22.019
- Give us a minute.
- Yeah.

918
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:28.709
6'1",

919
00:51:28.909 --> 00:51:32.379
fighting out
of the crenshaw district
of Los Angeles,

920
00:51:33.989 --> 00:51:37.289
"diamond" dame Anderson.

921
00:51:37.489 --> 00:51:38.849
Oh, shit.

922
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:42.549
See they finally got you
out of those chains.

923
00:51:42.749 --> 00:51:43.899
Mmm.

924
00:51:44.099 --> 00:51:45.099
How do I look?

925
00:51:46.479 --> 00:51:47.659
You look lighter.

926
00:51:52.969 --> 00:51:54.299
Thank you.

927
00:51:54.499 --> 00:51:55.819
You ain't gotta thank me.

928
00:51:56.279 --> 00:51:58.709
Just go out there and put on.

929
00:52:00.709 --> 00:52:01.799
For sure.

930
00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:21.899
And now,
ladies and gentlemen
in attendance,

931
00:52:22.099 --> 00:52:24.899
and boxing fans joining us
around the world,

932
00:52:25.099 --> 00:52:27.549
here we go.

933
00:52:27.749 --> 00:52:31.379
The challenger this evening,
"diamond" Damian Anderson.

934
00:52:31.579 --> 00:52:33.519
Out of
south central Los Angeles.

935
00:52:38.679 --> 00:52:41.349
<i>♪ All my life

936
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:44.269

940
00:52:51.689 --> 00:52:54.619
What is it about this guy
that's so special

941
00:52:54.819 --> 00:52:57.539
that he gets a title shot
his very first fight?

942
00:52:57.739 --> 00:53:00.759
Well, it all hinges
on Adonis creed.

943
00:53:00.959 --> 00:53:03.939
Creed says Anderson
is more than up to the task.

944
00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:07.419
But we'll find out ourselves
in just a moment.

945
00:53:07.619 --> 00:53:10.389
Will this be a fairy tale
or a massacre?

946
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:57.119
This guy is a true product
of creed athletics.

947
00:53:57.319 --> 00:54:00.519
Chavez made his presence felt
when he stormed onto the scene

948
00:54:00.719 --> 00:54:03.869
with a string
of devastating knockouts.

949
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:05.699
A proud fighter,

950
00:54:05.899 --> 00:54:09.439
he had one prediction
for this evening's
unlikely main event:

951
00:54:09.639 --> 00:54:11.049
Victory.

952
00:54:11.249 --> 00:54:13.009
From the crypto. Com arena,

953
00:54:13.209 --> 00:54:16.449
<i>it's time for the main event
of the evening.</i>

954
00:54:16.649 --> 00:54:18.189
<i>- It's showtime!</i>
- It's okay.

955
00:54:18.389 --> 00:54:20.099
I got it. Thank you.

956
00:54:20.299 --> 00:54:22.675
- <i>Introducing to you first, on my right...
</i>- I'm fine.

957
00:54:22.699 --> 00:54:24.279
Making his professional debut,

958
00:54:24.479 --> 00:54:27.629
in an unprecedented attempt
at a world title,

959
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:30.369
here is the former
golden gloves champion,

960
00:54:30.569 --> 00:54:36.069
"diamond" Damian Anderson.

961
00:54:37.449 --> 00:54:39.339
And his opponent across the ring

962
00:54:39.539 --> 00:54:42.339
is the defending world champion.

963
00:54:42.539 --> 00:54:45.469
With a record
of 15 wins and one loss,

964
00:54:45.669 --> 00:54:48.909
he has 14 wins
coming by way of knockout.

965
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:56.009
Introducing
Felix "El guerrero" Chavez.

966
00:54:57.559 --> 00:54:59.359
Center ring. Center ring.

967
00:54:59.559 --> 00:55:01.679
Gentlemen,
we went over the rules
in the dressing room.

968
00:55:01.819 --> 00:55:04.219
I wanna remind you
to protect yourself
at all times.

969
00:55:05.459 --> 00:55:07.979
Obey my commands.

970
00:55:08.179 --> 00:55:09.379
God bless you both.

971
00:55:12.119 --> 00:55:13.119
Touch up.

972
00:55:15.009 --> 00:55:18.939
Dame needs to start strong.

973
00:55:19.139 --> 00:55:20.899
It will be quick.

974
00:55:21.099 --> 00:55:23.079
Because Felix is a beast.

975
00:55:23.279 --> 00:55:24.729
Chavez! Chavez!

976
00:55:24.929 --> 00:55:26.929
The bell and the start
of round one,

977
00:55:26.979 --> 00:55:29.129
here at the crypto. Com arena.

978
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:32.169
- Chavez starts out aggressive.
- On the hunt.

979
00:55:32.369 --> 00:55:35.569
Sending a very clear message
to Anderson
of what he has in store.

980
00:55:35.769 --> 00:55:37.739
But Anderson is keeping
a tight guard.

981
00:55:40.599 --> 00:55:41.889
Come on, champ! Let's go.

982
00:55:44.499 --> 00:55:47.099
Don't lay off. Keep that
pressure there, baby.

983
00:55:47.299 --> 00:55:49.189
Chavez paws with that jab there

984
00:55:49.389 --> 00:55:51.159
but Anderson's showing
good movement.

985
00:55:58.429 --> 00:55:59.559
Whoo!

986
00:56:01.779 --> 00:56:03.899
Chavez walks him down...

987
00:56:04.099 --> 00:56:06.599
- Oh, wow!
What an awkward punch.
- Mmm.

988
00:56:06.799 --> 00:56:08.359
<i>That looked intentional.</i>

989
00:56:08.409 --> 00:56:09.559
Where all that power go?

990
00:56:09.759 --> 00:56:10.839
It ain't nothing. Let's go.

991
00:56:12.439 --> 00:56:13.559
Hands up, baby. Hands up.

992
00:56:13.759 --> 00:56:15.429
You ain't got nothing
I ain't seen, boy.

993
00:56:15.629 --> 00:56:17.519
Okay, grandpa.
<i>No tienes nada.</i>

994
00:56:17.719 --> 00:56:20.149
You soft. You soft.

995
00:56:25.559 --> 00:56:26.705
Anderson clinches.

996
00:56:26.729 --> 00:56:29.189
Get off the ropes.

997
00:56:29.389 --> 00:56:31.889
Before shelling back up
into that crab guard.

998
00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:33.569
Dame may be new to us,

999
00:56:33.609 --> 00:56:35.509
but he may have
some tricks in his bag.

1000
00:56:40.249 --> 00:56:41.889
- Come on, ref.
Didn't you see that?
- Box!

1001
00:56:45.139 --> 00:56:47.299
Some dangerous punches
to end the first.

1002
00:56:47.449 --> 00:56:50.119
Anderson might need
to freshen up
on the rule book, al.

1003
00:56:50.319 --> 00:56:51.319
Let's go, Felix.

1004
00:56:53.749 --> 00:56:54.949
Son! Listen to me.

1005
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:56.819
He thinks he's got you.

1006
00:56:57.019 --> 00:56:58.125
Everything's
going to be alright.

1007
00:56:58.149 --> 00:56:59.345
Stick to the plan.

1008
00:56:59.369 --> 00:57:00.525
- I know what I'm doing.
- Listen,

1009
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:01.785
you fight the fighter,
I fight the refs.

1010
00:57:01.809 --> 00:57:03.449
Don't let this
turn into no kind of brawl.

1011
00:57:03.509 --> 00:57:06.139
That's what he wants.
He's trying to agitate you.
No. Okay?

1012
00:57:06.339 --> 00:57:08.135
- I got this.
- Let's get out there.

1013
00:57:08.159 --> 00:57:08.919
You stole that round.
Don't get caught up...

1014
00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:10.529
- Water.
- In their stuff.

1015
00:57:10.729 --> 00:57:12.495
It's the first round
and you got bruises
on your face.

1016
00:57:12.519 --> 00:57:15.059
Come on,
you better than that, champ.
Stick to the script, baby.

1017
00:57:15.259 --> 00:57:17.779
You get out there
and fight the fight
that we worked so hard for.

1018
00:57:22.729 --> 00:57:24.939
Round two begins,

1019
00:57:25.139 --> 00:57:27.209
and Chavez is already
back on the attack.

1020
00:57:29.519 --> 00:57:31.119
There we go, champ.

1021
00:57:31.319 --> 00:57:33.385
Feels like Chavez
is back in the fight.

1022
00:57:40.139 --> 00:57:42.739
Mamma Mia!

1023
00:57:42.939 --> 00:57:47.279
Anderson swinging to separate
Chavez's head
from his shoulders.

1024
00:57:51.409 --> 00:57:53.969
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

1025
00:57:54.169 --> 00:57:56.729
- Yo! What is this?
- Wow, that looked deliberate.

1026
00:57:56.779 --> 00:57:58.105
- You! Time!
- The ref needs

1027
00:57:58.129 --> 00:57:59.849
to get control
before this gets out of hand.

1028
00:57:59.959 --> 00:58:01.799
- Can you continue?
- Yeah, I'm good. Let's go.

1029
00:58:01.869 --> 00:58:03.935
- Stay right here.
- - The only good news for Chavez is that

1030
00:58:03.959 --> 00:58:06.109
- that cut
is so far below his eye...
- Come here.

1031
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:08.635
- But it's still dangerous.
- Two-point deduction.
Intentional elbow.

1032
00:58:08.659 --> 00:58:09.659
It's about time, ref.

1033
00:58:09.839 --> 00:58:12.029
Two-point deduction.
Intentional elbow.

1034
00:58:12.229 --> 00:58:14.869
Listen, you keep this up
and you're gonna
get yourself disqualified.

1035
00:58:14.929 --> 00:58:16.295
- Do you understand?
- Right. Right.

1036
00:58:16.319 --> 00:58:17.555
Stay right there.

1037
00:58:17.579 --> 00:58:19.379
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1038
00:58:19.579 --> 00:58:20.865
If anyone was wondering...
Box!

1039
00:58:20.889 --> 00:58:23.259
What kind of fight
this would be,

1040
00:58:23.459 --> 00:58:26.699
it seems like
Anderson is out
to make this clear:

1041
00:58:26.899 --> 00:58:30.569
This is a fight for your life.

1042
00:58:30.769 --> 00:58:34.269
Let's hope Chavez can make it
back to his corner and adjust.

1043
00:58:34.469 --> 00:58:36.489
Big right hand to end the round

1044
00:58:36.689 --> 00:58:40.749
and Chavez
sends Anderson to the corner
with something to think about.

1045
00:58:40.949 --> 00:58:42.719
Way to finish.
Way to finish strong.

1046
00:58:47.639 --> 00:58:48.949
Let me get that mouthpiece.

1047
00:58:55.129 --> 00:58:56.699
Keep grinding, champ.
Round after round.

1048
00:59:01.919 --> 00:59:04.699
Hey, champ.
You good? Can you still go?

1049
00:59:05.529 --> 00:59:06.819
Yeah, I'm good.

1050
00:59:07.019 --> 00:59:08.139
Okay, he's good. Let's go.

1051
00:59:09.529 --> 00:59:10.669
He said he's good.

1052
00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:14.529
Listen, pain is temporary.

1053
00:59:14.729 --> 00:59:16.965
- Say it back to me.
Pain is temporary.
- Pain is temporary.

1054
00:59:16.989 --> 00:59:19.309
He a bum! Okay?
And you the champ, right?

1055
00:59:19.509 --> 00:59:21.229
I'm the champ.

1056
00:59:21.429 --> 00:59:23.629
Let's go, champ.
Keep your hands up.
Stay off them ropes.

1057
00:59:26.859 --> 00:59:28.369
Bring it in.

1058
00:59:28.569 --> 00:59:30.979
- That's good.
Let's go. <i>Vamos.</i>
- Come on.

1059
00:59:31.179 --> 00:59:32.545
Two rounds down,

1060
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:35.519
but it's clearly not the fight
any of us expected.

1061
00:59:36.389 --> 00:59:37.639
Stay in it, <i>mijo.</i>

1062
00:59:37.839 --> 00:59:39.639
Another shot to that left arm.

1063
00:59:42.959 --> 00:59:45.429
Things are starting
to get very ugly.

1064
00:59:45.629 --> 00:59:47.995
- Chavez is in
some serious trouble.
- Hands free. Stop!

1065
00:59:48.019 --> 00:59:49.779
- I gotta take her, d, okay?
- Okay.

1066
00:59:49.979 --> 00:59:51.039
We gotta go.

1067
00:59:51.239 --> 00:59:52.879
There's no such thing
as defeat. Let's go.

1068
00:59:52.979 --> 00:59:54.175
This is dangerous.

1069
00:59:54.199 --> 00:59:55.799
Anderson swinging
like a wrecking ball...

1070
00:59:55.849 --> 00:59:57.849
- Move. Move!
- And Chavez
is getting demolished.

1071
01:00:07.199 --> 01:00:11.709
Oh, what a shot by Anderson.
Down goes Chavez.

1072
01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:15.239
<i>Chavez is not getting back up.</i>

1073
01:00:15.439 --> 01:00:17.369
Oh, no.
You don't wanna see that.

1074
01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:19.159
Chavez is down

1075
01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:21.769
- and appears
to be badly hurt.
- No, no, no.

1076
01:00:21.969 --> 01:00:23.599
Felix!

1077
01:00:23.799 --> 01:00:25.685
Ladies and gentlemen...

1078
01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:27.589
- <i>¿Que Paso?</i>
- Our referee in charge,

1079
01:00:27.629 --> 01:00:29.815
- Russell mora, stops the contest.
- - Call the paramedics!

1080
01:00:29.839 --> 01:00:32.199
He is the winner...
Doc, is he gonna be okay?

1081
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:33.909
By way of spectacular knockout

1082
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:38.039
and he is the new unified
heavyweight champion
of the world,

1083
01:00:38.239 --> 01:00:41.999
"diamond" Damian Anderson.

1084
01:00:42.199 --> 01:00:45.369
'Sup, bro? 'Sup, bro?

1085
01:00:46.369 --> 01:00:48.199
Right? What?

1086
01:01:21.189 --> 01:01:22.959
All right, Duke.
We gotta make this right.

1087
01:01:23.159 --> 01:01:25.279
- Whatever I can do...
- No.
I told you, dawg, already.

1088
01:01:25.329 --> 01:01:27.265
Ain't no making nothing right.
Ain't no "Duke" nothing.

1089
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:28.699
- I can fix it.
- No!

1090
01:01:28.899 --> 01:01:30.709
You can't.

1091
01:01:30.909 --> 01:01:33.629
You stay away from the gym.
You do that.
And stay away for a while.

1092
01:02:03.449 --> 01:02:04.909
Hey, ma.

1093
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:06.439
How's Felix?

1094
01:02:08.889 --> 01:02:10.149
He's still at the hospital.

1095
01:02:10.889 --> 01:02:12.149
He's stable.

1096
01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:16.095
I figured I'd get out of there
and give him some space.

1097
01:02:16.119 --> 01:02:17.119
Mm-hmm.

1098
01:02:17.769 --> 01:02:19.069
May be smart.

1099
01:02:24.639 --> 01:02:25.819
What's all this?

1100
01:02:29.119 --> 01:02:30.299
They're from Damian.

1101
01:02:44.919 --> 01:02:46.959
You kept these from me?

1102
01:02:47.159 --> 01:02:48.839
To help you move on, yes, I did.

1103
01:02:54.059 --> 01:02:55.109
Mama, how could you?

1104
01:02:57.979 --> 01:02:59.399
I was trying to protect you.

1105
01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:00.799
Protect me from what?

1106
01:03:00.999 --> 01:03:02.709
Damian was my brother.

1107
01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:04.669
No, Donnie.

1108
01:03:04.869 --> 01:03:07.449
Not in that facility
where you were caged
like an animal.

1109
01:03:07.649 --> 01:03:09.769
Did you think
that I was gonna
let you go back to that?

1110
01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:12.339
You made him think
I abandoned him.

1111
01:03:14.299 --> 01:03:15.679
Do you know
what we went through?

1112
01:03:15.879 --> 01:03:17.719
I know who that man was
the two of you beat up.

1113
01:03:19.699 --> 01:03:20.789
You know Leon?

1114
01:03:26.699 --> 01:03:28.999
Yeah.

1115
01:03:29.199 --> 01:03:32.829
Then you know Damian
had my back before
you even knew who I was.

1116
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:35.089
Dame treated me
more like family
than your two kids

1117
01:03:35.289 --> 01:03:36.289
ever did in this house.

1118
01:03:36.419 --> 01:03:38.349
And you took that away from me.

1119
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:40.589
None of this would've happened
if it wasn't for you.

1120
01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:44.899
You're absolutely right.

1121
01:03:47.509 --> 01:03:48.599
None of it.

1122
01:03:50.339 --> 01:03:51.949
You hit hard, Donnie.

1123
01:03:52.989 --> 01:03:55.209
And you can't see.

1124
01:03:58.129 --> 01:04:00.349
There may have been a time
when Damian had your back.

1125
01:04:03.259 --> 01:04:05.129
But that's not
what he's doing now.

1126
01:04:39.389 --> 01:04:40.389
Excuse me.

1127
01:04:40.569 --> 01:04:43.069
Yo, dame. Dame.

1128
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:44.899
- Hey, man.
- Get your hands off me.

1129
01:04:45.099 --> 01:04:46.729
Get your hands off me!

1130
01:04:47.929 --> 01:04:48.929
Hold up.

1131
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:52.049
It's aight. Cool out, bro.

1132
01:04:53.659 --> 01:04:54.659
Give me that.

1133
01:04:59.839 --> 01:05:01.019
That's what we on?

1134
01:05:02.839 --> 01:05:05.179
What's up, Donnie?
You all right?
You look tidy, bro.

1135
01:05:05.379 --> 01:05:07.109
Man. Nah, nah,
you tell me, bro.

1136
01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:10.419
You've been playing me
this whole time.

1137
01:05:11.979 --> 01:05:13.709
Guess you did
get them letters, huh?

1138
01:05:13.909 --> 01:05:14.909
Why'd you lie to me?

1139
01:05:15.859 --> 01:05:18.539
I vouched for you.

1140
01:05:18.739 --> 01:05:20.769
I brought you
into my home, bro.
You met my family.

1141
01:05:22.379 --> 01:05:24.979
I put money up for you.

1142
01:05:25.179 --> 01:05:27.025
- Put the gloves on your hands
like you asked.
- All right. That's enough.

1143
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:29.439
You feel me?

1144
01:05:30.779 --> 01:05:32.869
You put the gloves on my hands?

1145
01:05:34.049 --> 01:05:35.049
Oh, homey.

1146
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:37.169
You must be punchy.

1147
01:05:39.849 --> 01:05:43.179
'Cause if memory serves,
you used to carry my gloves.

1148
01:05:43.379 --> 01:05:45.699
Get your shit
and get out the gym.

1149
01:05:45.899 --> 01:05:48.439
Oh, Donnie, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

1150
01:05:48.639 --> 01:05:49.639
You think I need you?

1151
01:05:51.019 --> 01:05:54.009
No. When I got locked up,
I needed you.

1152
01:05:54.209 --> 01:05:57.719
When I came home,
yeah, bro, I needed you.

1153
01:05:59.549 --> 01:06:00.859
But look around, bro.

1154
01:06:02.689 --> 01:06:04.979
- I'm the champ!
- Yeah!

1155
01:06:05.179 --> 01:06:07.979
And I don't need you
for nothing or... or nothing.

1156
01:06:11.559 --> 01:06:12.699
Who alone now?

1157
01:06:17.919 --> 01:06:20.689
Yeah, that's right. Run away.

1158
01:06:20.889 --> 01:06:22.769
Run away.
That's the one thing
you still good at,

1159
01:06:22.809 --> 01:06:24.349
baby creed.

1160
01:06:29.799 --> 01:06:30.839
What was that?

1161
01:06:32.409 --> 01:06:33.809
- What'd you call me?
- Oh, you mad?

1162
01:06:35.889 --> 01:06:37.069
You mad?

1163
01:06:39.159 --> 01:06:40.585
Try spending
half your life in a cell

1164
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:42.509
watching somebody else
live your life.

1165
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:46.209
You turned your back on me,
homey.

1166
01:06:49.119 --> 01:06:50.779
Hey, but look, don't trip.

1167
01:06:52.569 --> 01:06:53.849
Hey, come here.

1168
01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:55.089
Remember this?

1169
01:06:56.699 --> 01:06:57.859
This title?

1170
01:06:58.059 --> 01:07:00.339
All this?

1171
01:07:00.539 --> 01:07:02.529
Hey, I'm just getting started,
little brother.

1172
01:07:03.959 --> 01:07:05.569
I'm coming for it all.

1173
01:07:06.879 --> 01:07:08.529
And what's that
supposed to mean?

1174
01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.539
Are you threatening me?

1175
01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:18.459
Ain't no threats here, bro.

1176
01:07:19.719 --> 01:07:21.009
Just promises here, homey.

1177
01:07:23.949 --> 01:07:25.059
Come here. Let's see.

1178
01:07:25.259 --> 01:07:27.019
- Get your hands off me.
- Oh, you all right.

1179
01:07:31.299 --> 01:07:32.429
Yeah.

1180
01:07:33.429 --> 01:07:34.599
Help yourself up for once.

1181
01:07:35.999 --> 01:07:37.039
See how it feel.

1182
01:07:53.929 --> 01:07:55.059
Aloha!

1183
01:08:06.039 --> 01:08:07.359
Where were you all night?

1184
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:12.899
You didn't get
any of my calls then,
or this morning?

1185
01:08:17.999 --> 01:08:19.549
What happened to your eye?

1186
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:20.749
Nothing.

1187
01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:25.049
Are you okay?

1188
01:08:27.529 --> 01:08:29.810
Not today.
I ain't got time for a therapy session.

1189
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:33.909
Okay. Well, then
what do you have time for?

1190
01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.349
Let me know.

1191
01:08:36.549 --> 01:08:39.045
Because I have been trying
to talk to you for
a really long time, Donnie.

1192
01:08:39.069 --> 01:08:40.069
All right?

1193
01:08:41.889 --> 01:08:44.059
Please, can you tell me
what is going on.

1194
01:08:45.499 --> 01:08:46.529
Is it me?

1195
01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:49.359
No.
It's nothing to do with you.

1196
01:08:57.639 --> 01:08:58.689
Is it about Leon?

1197
01:09:00.079 --> 01:09:03.339
What? Who told you that?

1198
01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:06.699
Dame.

1199
01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:10.529
Is there something else
you wanna tell me?

1200
01:09:14.629 --> 01:09:17.389
D, you have got to
open up at some point.

1201
01:09:17.589 --> 01:09:19.909
I don't know what else
to tell you.
I need to understand.

1202
01:09:20.109 --> 01:09:22.109
What do you want me to say?
What do you wanna hear?

1203
01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:23.609
Some sad story?

1204
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:25.699
You're trying
to feel sorry for me
or something?

1205
01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:27.925
I don't wanna
feel sorry for you!
I wanna understand you!

1206
01:09:27.949 --> 01:09:30.099
I wanna know
what is going on with you
in my house!

1207
01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:33.009
There's nothing to talk about!
I don't wanna
talk about anything!

1208
01:09:33.209 --> 01:09:34.969
I've been trying to forget it!

1209
01:09:35.169 --> 01:09:38.239
It's dead! Leave it! Leave it!
Let it lie!

1210
01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:40.119
I'm not talking
about that shit no more.

1211
01:09:50.129 --> 01:09:52.639
You figure out your shit, d.

1212
01:09:52.839 --> 01:09:56.919
Because what cannot happen
is her seeing you like this.

1213
01:09:58.789 --> 01:10:00.009
Do you understand?

1214
01:10:01.319 --> 01:10:02.619
Yeah.

1215
01:10:09.979 --> 01:10:11.149
I love you.

1216
01:10:56.199 --> 01:10:58.199
<i>Hey, what y'all doing in there?</i>

1217
01:10:58.939 --> 01:11:01.059
Dame! Adonis!

1218
01:11:01.259 --> 01:11:03.105
- Stop!
- Come on! Fight me!

1219
01:11:03.129 --> 01:11:04.195
<i>Leon, I'm sorry!</i>

1220
01:11:04.219 --> 01:11:05.469
<i>Y'all are so tough, huh?</i>

1221
01:11:19.219 --> 01:11:21.249
<i>- Leon?
- Huh?</i>

1222
01:11:21.449 --> 01:11:23.049
<i>Don't remember me, do you?</i>

1223
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:33.959
Hey, get off him!

1224
01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:35.449
Yeah, you know what it is,
homey.

1225
01:11:43.719 --> 01:11:45.145
- Dame!
- Step away from the gun.

1226
01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:46.649
- Step away from the gun.
- It's down.

1227
01:11:46.739 --> 01:11:47.739
It's down! It's down.

1228
01:11:57.739 --> 01:11:59.509
- Hey, mama.
<i>- Adonis, baby.</i>

1229
01:11:59.709 --> 01:12:01.289
<i>You gotta get here right away.</i>

1230
01:12:01.489 --> 01:12:03.769
<i>Mama had another stroke.</i>

1231
01:12:03.969 --> 01:12:06.779
<i>They're saying
multiple organ failures.</i>

1232
01:12:06.979 --> 01:12:09.649
<i>- I don't know, d.
- I think it's...</i>

1233
01:12:09.849 --> 01:12:11.839
<i>I think it might be time
to say goodbye.</i>

1234
01:12:14.009 --> 01:12:15.839
Mama?

1235
01:12:20.109 --> 01:12:21.619
Mom, I'm sorry.

1236
01:12:21.819 --> 01:12:23.679
- What?
- I didn't mean it.

1237
01:12:24.419 --> 01:12:25.879
I didn't mean it.

1238
01:12:26.079 --> 01:12:27.199
Mm-mmm.

1239
01:12:28.679 --> 01:12:30.939
The day I met you.

1240
01:12:32.289 --> 01:12:34.689
Ooh, that face.

1241
01:12:35.899 --> 01:12:39.809
Mmm. You were so mad.

1242
01:12:40.009 --> 01:12:45.949
Gonna knock everybody out,
one by one.

1243
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:47.699
Just like your father.

1244
01:12:50.269 --> 01:12:53.229
That's why he fought so hard.
You know that, right?

1245
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:55.819
Yeah.

1246
01:12:56.019 --> 01:12:59.929
But you... you don't have
to do that.

1247
01:13:00.759 --> 01:13:03.719
You can find another way.

1248
01:13:05.329 --> 01:13:06.749
Yeah.

1249
01:13:08.599 --> 01:13:10.679
Yeah, another way.

1250
01:13:11.549 --> 01:13:12.989
Another way.

1251
01:13:14.419 --> 01:13:15.979
I was angry.

1252
01:13:16.179 --> 01:13:19.989
I was so angry
when you left me, Apollo.

1253
01:13:24.909 --> 01:13:28.569
Why did you leave me alone?

1254
01:13:31.999 --> 01:13:33.879
Adonis.

1255
01:13:35.269 --> 01:13:37.229
That's his name.

1256
01:13:38.489 --> 01:13:39.565
I'm right here.

1257
01:13:39.589 --> 01:13:42.359
He saved me, Apollo.

1258
01:13:44.799 --> 01:13:48.139
He helped me to forgive you.

1259
01:13:48.339 --> 01:13:49.979
Mom, I'm sorry.

1260
01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:53.199
Just tell me what to do.

1261
01:13:55.379 --> 01:13:57.509
Okay?

1262
01:13:58.599 --> 01:14:00.379
Adonis.

1263
01:14:02.469 --> 01:14:03.779
Adoni...

1264
01:15:35.909 --> 01:15:37.039
I'm sorry.

1265
01:15:40.089 --> 01:15:41.089
I know.

1266
01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:44.949
It's okay.

1267
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:46.149
No, it's not.

1268
01:15:47.659 --> 01:15:48.749
It's just...

1269
01:15:49.789 --> 01:15:50.929
When dame came back...

1270
01:15:53.579 --> 01:15:57.669
All this shit came back too.

1271
01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:00.169
I didn't know how to handle it.

1272
01:16:01.719 --> 01:16:03.799
But you were always
really good at that.

1273
01:16:03.999 --> 01:16:06.449
Feelings.
It comes easy to you.

1274
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:08.249
Doesn't come easy to me.

1275
01:16:09.679 --> 01:16:10.729
Doesn't.

1276
01:16:12.509 --> 01:16:15.459
I still got a lot of stuff
that I'm trying to figure out,

1277
01:16:15.659 --> 01:16:18.809
and I don't always know
how to talk about it either.

1278
01:16:19.009 --> 01:16:20.609
You know, Mary-Anne
was the closest thing

1279
01:16:20.749 --> 01:16:22.509
I've had to a mom
in a really long time.

1280
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:24.129
I could talk to her.

1281
01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:25.919
Now she's gone.

1282
01:16:29.219 --> 01:16:33.609
And when I stopped performing,
it was really hard to accept

1283
01:16:33.809 --> 01:16:36.579
that my dreams didn't turn out
the way that I imagined
that they would.

1284
01:16:39.319 --> 01:16:40.669
And that still hurts me.

1285
01:16:42.889 --> 01:16:43.939
A lot.

1286
01:16:45.939 --> 01:16:50.059
But I just made a choice
to try to move on

1287
01:16:50.259 --> 01:16:52.159
and be happy
about what I do have.

1288
01:16:57.209 --> 01:16:58.989
But it's not easy.

1289
01:17:02.389 --> 01:17:03.689
I just try.

1290
01:17:19.409 --> 01:17:20.489
Leon...

1291
01:17:22.759 --> 01:17:24.579
Was the dad at the group home

1292
01:17:26.019 --> 01:17:27.239
where I lived with dame.

1293
01:17:31.369 --> 01:17:33.329
I'm not saying me
and dame were angels.

1294
01:17:35.159 --> 01:17:37.279
Okay? But...

1295
01:17:37.479 --> 01:17:40.209
No kid deserves
to get beat on like we did.

1296
01:17:41.509 --> 01:17:42.509
You feel me?

1297
01:17:44.209 --> 01:17:47.519
That night
at the liquor store,
I saw Leon.

1298
01:17:51.609 --> 01:17:52.739
And I snapped.

1299
01:17:57.049 --> 01:17:58.269
And I hit him.

1300
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:02.489
I kept hitting him.

1301
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:07.849
And his boys jumped on me.

1302
01:18:10.199 --> 01:18:11.279
So dame pulled a gun.

1303
01:18:12.979 --> 01:18:14.029
Cops pulled up.

1304
01:18:15.509 --> 01:18:16.589
We tried to run.

1305
01:18:17.769 --> 01:18:20.419
Dame got caught. I got away.

1306
01:18:23.559 --> 01:18:24.989
I ran.

1307
01:18:26.429 --> 01:18:27.599
You were a kid.

1308
01:18:29.389 --> 01:18:32.809
You were scared.
Anybody would've run.

1309
01:18:33.009 --> 01:18:35.949
And dame had a gun, Adonis.
That's not on you.

1310
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:38.089
Yeah, but when he went down,
I didn't reach out.

1311
01:18:40.439 --> 01:18:41.619
I never called.

1312
01:18:42.439 --> 01:18:43.529
I didn't write.

1313
01:18:47.249 --> 01:18:52.239
After a while, it felt easier
to pretend like I forgot.

1314
01:18:53.109 --> 01:18:54.329
You know, just...

1315
01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:58.269
Act like it never happened.

1316
01:18:58.469 --> 01:19:01.199
But that doesn't
make you responsible
for how his life turned out.

1317
01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:07.029
You are a good man, Adonis.

1318
01:19:07.769 --> 01:19:10.159
I don't know anymore.

1319
01:19:10.359 --> 01:19:12.369
You have got to try
to forgive yourself,

1320
01:19:12.569 --> 01:19:16.909
so that you can begin
to believe that you deserve
the life that you have earned.

1321
01:19:18.699 --> 01:19:20.179
Because you do.

1322
01:19:21.829 --> 01:19:24.139
Don't let him destroy
everything you've built.

1323
01:19:25.789 --> 01:19:27.559
But, b, he's not gonna stop.

1324
01:19:27.759 --> 01:19:29.139
Then you make him.

1325
01:19:31.059 --> 01:19:33.189
There's only one way
that dame's gonna listen.

1326
01:19:38.759 --> 01:19:40.589
If that's what you gotta do,
then...

1327
01:19:41.499 --> 01:19:43.409
All right.

1328
01:19:43.609 --> 01:19:46.129
At 26 and one, he's the former
heavyweight champion
of the world.

1329
01:19:46.169 --> 01:19:48.799
One of the greatest fighters
in the history of boxing.

1330
01:19:48.999 --> 01:19:51.280
The one and only Adonis creed
is sitting right next to me.

1331
01:19:51.439 --> 01:19:52.985
Welcome to the show, my man.
How you doing?

1332
01:19:53.009 --> 01:19:54.649
I'm doing okay, man.
Thanks for having me.

1333
01:19:54.749 --> 01:19:56.589
Yeah...
Thank you for being here.

1334
01:19:56.749 --> 01:19:59.549
You called to be on this show,
which you've never done.

1335
01:19:59.749 --> 01:20:02.469
I wanna know why you felt
the need

1336
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:04.469
to come on national television
today to speak.

1337
01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:05.629
What's on your mind?

1338
01:20:05.719 --> 01:20:07.429
When I walked away from boxing,

1339
01:20:07.629 --> 01:20:09.669
- I walked away
with some unfinished business.
- Mmm.

1340
01:20:09.759 --> 01:20:12.389
Gotta be talking about dame.
Gotta be talking about him.

1341
01:20:12.589 --> 01:20:13.949
Let's just get this
out of the way.

1342
01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:15.355
You know I believe
you're the best

1343
01:20:15.379 --> 01:20:16.819
pound-for-pound fighter
in the world,

1344
01:20:16.939 --> 01:20:18.699
three years ago.

1345
01:20:18.899 --> 01:20:20.575
It's been a minute
since you've been
out in these streets,

1346
01:20:20.599 --> 01:20:22.275
so maybe you haven't heard
what they've been saying
about you.

1347
01:20:22.299 --> 01:20:23.789
<i>Conlan.</i>

1348
01:20:23.989 --> 01:20:25.629
<i>He was beyond his prime
when you beat him.</i>

1349
01:20:25.739 --> 01:20:27.059
<i>Dame.</i>

1350
01:20:27.259 --> 01:20:29.449
<i>He's the next king of boxing.
Not you. Okay?</i>

1351
01:20:29.649 --> 01:20:31.799
<i>Every time you turn around,</i>

1352
01:20:31.999 --> 01:20:33.895
<i>dame is talking</i>
<i>about you dirty,</i>
<i>and unapologetically.</i>

1353
01:20:33.919 --> 01:20:35.499
Hey, turn that up.

1354
01:20:35.699 --> 01:20:37.809
To anybody who'll listen,
he questions your manhood,

1355
01:20:38.009 --> 01:20:39.239
he talks about your family.

1356
01:20:39.439 --> 01:20:40.999
He talks about
how you can't be trusted,

1357
01:20:41.099 --> 01:20:42.419
and that you run out
on your boys.

1358
01:20:42.619 --> 01:20:43.989
No, no. No.
Wait. Let me just...

1359
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:45.859
Hold on.
We got a call coming in.

1360
01:20:46.059 --> 01:20:48.079
We got a call.
Put him on, right now.

1361
01:20:48.279 --> 01:20:49.819
Hey, what up, little homey?

1362
01:20:50.019 --> 01:20:51.389
<i>You want a tissue?</i>

1363
01:20:51.589 --> 01:20:53.309
<i>Want me to come on there
and give you a hug?</i>

1364
01:20:53.499 --> 01:20:55.395
<i>Aight, look, I'm just telling
everybody who you really are.</i>

1365
01:20:55.419 --> 01:20:57.519
<i>How you run out on family.</i>

1366
01:20:57.719 --> 01:21:02.049
Dame, uh, not like this.

1367
01:21:02.249 --> 01:21:03.485
<i>This ain't the way to handle it.</i>

1368
01:21:03.509 --> 01:21:05.579
Oh, bad news, bro.
This is live.

1369
01:21:05.779 --> 01:21:07.619
So, I mean, this how
we gonna handle it now.

1370
01:21:07.819 --> 01:21:09.539
<i>Little Donnie</i>
<i>ain't got nothin'.</i>
<i>He a coward.</i>

1371
01:21:09.689 --> 01:21:12.319
You a coward, bro, and a fraud.

1372
01:21:12.519 --> 01:21:14.149
I know it.
Everybody else know it.

1373
01:21:14.349 --> 01:21:16.719
Hey, Apollo creed
would be ashamed.

1374
01:21:16.919 --> 01:21:18.039
Oh, you lost it.

1375
01:21:18.509 --> 01:21:20.549
Aight.

1376
01:21:20.749 --> 01:21:23.149
I challenge you
for the heavyweight
championship of the world.

1377
01:21:23.649 --> 01:21:24.459
You and me?

1378
01:21:24.659 --> 01:21:26.199
- Run it.
- Run it!

1379
01:21:26.399 --> 01:21:28.645
Oh, hell yes.
Y'all heard it here first.

1380
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:30.079
<i>I know I can't wait for this.</i>

1381
01:21:30.279 --> 01:21:31.605
There you go.
What's up, champ?

1382
01:21:31.629 --> 01:21:33.509
- What's going on?
- Prime time.

1383
01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:35.909
The champ is here!
Y'all better turn it up.

1384
01:21:36.109 --> 01:21:37.559
Here we go, folks.

1385
01:21:41.289 --> 01:21:42.489
Let's get reacquainted.

1386
01:21:50.419 --> 01:21:52.709
Fractured fourth
and fifth metacarpals.

1387
01:21:52.909 --> 01:21:54.669
Both hands.

1388
01:21:54.869 --> 01:21:55.579
His eye socket broke.

1389
01:21:55.779 --> 01:21:56.779
Ruptured kidney.

1390
01:21:58.339 --> 01:22:00.329
- His shoulder don't work.
- Torn abductor.

1391
01:22:00.529 --> 01:22:02.855
He don't got it no more.
He retired. He probably
won't even make weight.

1392
01:22:02.879 --> 01:22:04.759
And remind me,
how many concussions
have you had?

1393
01:22:11.039 --> 01:22:13.689
You're old, and you're broken.

1394
01:22:13.889 --> 01:22:16.819
We know dame.
Dame gonna have
this damn list memorized.

1395
01:22:17.019 --> 01:22:20.479
<i>He's willing to do anything</i>
<i>to win, so you gotta</i>
<i>be prepared for everything.</i>

1396
01:22:20.679 --> 01:22:24.219
We can't turn back the clock,
we can't hide all your flaws,

1397
01:22:24.419 --> 01:22:26.229
but we can make 'em strengths.

1398
01:22:33.199 --> 01:22:34.789
That's it. Two jabs.

1399
01:22:34.989 --> 01:22:36.229
- Come under.
- Slip.

1400
01:22:36.429 --> 01:22:37.429
One-one-two.

1401
01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:38.669
- I got you.
- Let's go, d.

1402
01:22:38.869 --> 01:22:42.019
The higher you get,
the harder it gets.

1403
01:22:42.219 --> 01:22:44.629
That's life. That's this run!

1404
01:22:44.829 --> 01:22:46.239
Let's go.

1405
01:22:46.439 --> 01:22:49.199
Tug-of-war. Old-school.

1406
01:22:49.399 --> 01:22:51.249
Right here. Let's go.
Over and over.

1407
01:22:51.449 --> 01:22:52.449
Push.

1408
01:22:52.579 --> 01:22:53.739
Push!

1409
01:22:55.259 --> 01:22:56.859
What you looking back, boy?
Look forward.

1410
01:22:57.019 --> 01:22:58.619
Who slips like this?
Nobody. Bring it in.

1411
01:22:58.669 --> 01:23:00.469
Ain't nobody gonna
take it easy on him, right?

1412
01:23:01.569 --> 01:23:03.269
Come on. Focus up.

1413
01:23:10.279 --> 01:23:11.709
There you go.

1414
01:23:13.059 --> 01:23:14.109
There you go.

1415
01:23:15.939 --> 01:23:16.939
Come on, man.

1416
01:23:18.019 --> 01:23:19.359
Stop thinking so much, man.

1417
01:23:19.559 --> 01:23:20.769
Get your head in the game.

1418
01:23:23.069 --> 01:23:25.679
You see that man right there?
Do you remember him?

1419
01:23:27.729 --> 01:23:30.069
You gotta block out everything
and be in the moment.

1420
01:23:30.269 --> 01:23:32.769
Not the past. Not the future.

1421
01:23:32.969 --> 01:23:33.969
Right now.

1422
01:23:35.999 --> 01:23:37.199
Let's go. Come on.

1423
01:23:37.399 --> 01:23:38.399
Well...

1424
01:23:39.129 --> 01:23:41.119
Hey.

1425
01:23:41.319 --> 01:23:43.249
- How's the...
- Nah, nah. Don't. Don't.

1426
01:23:43.449 --> 01:23:44.649
But you're good?

1427
01:23:44.849 --> 01:23:46.789
Good enough to beat you.

1428
01:23:59.939 --> 01:24:00.939
Keep your hands up.

1429
01:24:02.199 --> 01:24:03.589
Move. Move!

1430
01:24:04.849 --> 01:24:05.849
You can go home, dawg.

1431
01:24:18.609 --> 01:24:20.199
Maybe we should take a break.

1432
01:24:20.399 --> 01:24:21.399
Take a break?

1433
01:25:25.369 --> 01:25:26.809
Where you goin'?

1434
01:25:29.369 --> 01:25:30.639
I'm just getting started.

1435
01:27:04.159 --> 01:27:05.159
I see you, boy.

1436
01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:11.689
Whoo! We're out here working
right now!

1437
01:27:14.259 --> 01:27:16.569
Where is he? Where is he?

1438
01:27:16.959 --> 01:27:17.999
I see you.

1439
01:27:43.859 --> 01:27:46.379
Let's do it, baby!
Let's go! Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

1440
01:27:46.439 --> 01:27:48.159
There you go! There you go!

1441
01:28:07.049 --> 01:28:08.179
Let's go!

1442
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:17.139
Welcome to Los Angeles

1443
01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:20.269
for one of
the most highly anticipated
heavyweight bouts in years.

1444
01:28:20.469 --> 01:28:21.719
One step.

1445
01:28:22.889 --> 01:28:24.539
One punch.

1446
01:28:24.739 --> 01:28:26.199
One round at a time.

1447
01:28:28.769 --> 01:28:29.809
One step.

1448
01:28:30.819 --> 01:28:31.859
One punch.

1449
01:28:33.169 --> 01:28:34.649
One round at a time.

1450
01:28:35.249 --> 01:28:36.599
One step.

1451
01:28:37.999 --> 01:28:39.039
One punch.

1452
01:28:40.219 --> 01:28:41.699
One round at a time.

1453
01:28:55.239 --> 01:28:58.829
Creed! Creed!
Creed! Creed!

1454
01:28:59.029 --> 01:29:02.399
Creed! Creed! Creed!

1455
01:29:02.599 --> 01:29:05.969
Creed! Creed! Creed! Creed!

1456
01:29:11.069 --> 01:29:13.709
Whoa!

1457
01:29:13.909 --> 01:29:15.249
Yeah, boy!

1458
01:30:10.799 --> 01:30:12.599
What's up, la?

1459
01:31:23.959 --> 01:31:26.059
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening,

1460
01:31:26.259 --> 01:31:30.779
and welcome
to the battle of Los Angeles.

1461
01:31:32.649 --> 01:31:35.999
The fight starts now!

1462
01:31:38.789 --> 01:31:41.079
Introducing first,
the challenger.

1463
01:31:41.279 --> 01:31:43.299
Fighting out of the delphi gym

1464
01:31:43.499 --> 01:31:48.519
and proudly representing
his home
of Los Angeles, California,

1465
01:31:48.719 --> 01:31:55.179
here is the former light
heavyweight and heavyweight
champion of the world,

1466
01:31:55.379 --> 01:32:00.019
Adonis creed!

1467
01:32:01.239 --> 01:32:03.069
Creed!

1468
01:32:04.589 --> 01:32:06.499
And his opponent
across the ring,

1469
01:32:06.699 --> 01:32:11.809
he represents
the crenshaw district
of Los Angeles, California.

1470
01:32:12.009 --> 01:32:15.159
Here is the former
golden gloves champion

1471
01:32:15.359 --> 01:32:19.729
and the reigning,
defending, undefeated

1472
01:32:19.929 --> 01:32:24.209
and unified
heavyweight champion
of the world,

1473
01:32:24.409 --> 01:32:28.489
"diamond" Damian Anderson!

1474
01:32:29.139 --> 01:32:31.169
Anderson!

1475
01:32:31.369 --> 01:32:33.525
Creed retired
a champion, but he's
definitely the underdog.

1476
01:32:33.549 --> 01:32:35.525
Yeah, there's no doubt
dame has the upper hand.

1477
01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:37.529
He looks to be
in phenomenal shape.

1478
01:32:37.729 --> 01:32:40.699
You both received
your instructions
in your dressing room.

1479
01:32:40.899 --> 01:32:43.579
I want a good, clean fight.

1480
01:32:43.779 --> 01:32:47.619
Obey my commands at all times.
Above all, protect yourself
at all times.

1481
01:32:47.819 --> 01:32:49.069
Let's go.

1482
01:32:50.809 --> 01:32:52.509
You on your own now,
little Donnie.

1483
01:32:54.379 --> 01:32:56.239
Go to your corners.

1484
01:32:56.439 --> 01:32:59.029
The intensity here is
like nothing I've ever seen.

1485
01:32:59.229 --> 01:33:02.199
Yeah, you can absolutely feel
the bad blood
between each other

1486
01:33:02.399 --> 01:33:03.569
in this battle of la.

1487
01:33:07.129 --> 01:33:09.249
And we're off.

1488
01:33:09.449 --> 01:33:13.259
And the big question here
in round one, how much
ring rust will Adonis have?

1489
01:33:13.459 --> 01:33:15.299
Three years out of the game.

1490
01:33:15.499 --> 01:33:18.869
And the way dame attacks,
this could be over early.

1491
01:33:19.069 --> 01:33:21.269
A little bit
of a cautious start
early on here.

1492
01:33:21.469 --> 01:33:23.575
Still not clear yet
who's going to be
the one dictating.

1493
01:33:23.599 --> 01:33:24.619
Stop holding back, d.

1494
01:33:24.819 --> 01:33:26.279
You're giving him
too much respect.

1495
01:33:29.769 --> 01:33:33.449
Anderson gets
first blood with a nasty shot
to the arm of creed.

1496
01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:35.629
Both fighters
sizing each other up.

1497
01:33:35.829 --> 01:33:39.759
And, boom, a stiff jab
to the face lands,
and creed is gonna tie him up.

1498
01:33:44.519 --> 01:33:46.069
Keep those hands up! Let's go!

1499
01:33:46.269 --> 01:33:47.869
You gotta commit, d!
Gotta commit!

1500
01:33:48.009 --> 01:33:49.179
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1501
01:34:02.539 --> 01:34:03.579
Come on, d!

1502
01:34:06.239 --> 01:34:09.055
I'd give
that round to Anderson
with an impressive start here.

1503
01:34:09.079 --> 01:34:11.229
All right, little Donnie.
I'll see you in a minute.

1504
01:34:11.429 --> 01:34:12.979
Don't worry.
I'll be right back.

1505
01:34:14.159 --> 01:34:16.229
Way to hang out there.
Wear him out.

1506
01:34:16.429 --> 01:34:18.889
Look, the boy a punk.
He see you not scared.

1507
01:34:19.089 --> 01:34:20.895
Now it's time for him
to start fighting dirty,
right?

1508
01:34:20.919 --> 01:34:22.759
Keep your head on tight.
Let him make mistakes.

1509
01:34:22.829 --> 01:34:24.245
He gonna make
a lot of them, all right?

1510
01:34:24.269 --> 01:34:26.379
And attack those windows
when they open.

1511
01:34:26.579 --> 01:34:28.299
You throwing
power punches, champ.

1512
01:34:28.449 --> 01:34:30.289
- Pace yourself.
- - I know what I'm doing.

1513
01:34:30.319 --> 01:34:31.419
Don't worry about me.

1514
01:34:31.619 --> 01:34:33.339
All that money can't save him.
Believe that.

1515
01:34:33.539 --> 01:34:35.579
You gotta wonder
if creed's regretting

1516
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:37.339
his decision
to get back in the ring.

1517
01:34:37.539 --> 01:34:39.659
Retirement sure seems like
it would be a lot more fun.

1518
01:34:41.849 --> 01:34:45.219
Round two
underway here
in Los Angeles, live on dazn.

1519
01:34:45.419 --> 01:34:47.789
Let's see if Adonis can find
his championship form

1520
01:34:47.989 --> 01:34:49.539
and make a fight out of this.

1521
01:34:55.979 --> 01:34:57.289
Stop running, Donnie.

1522
01:35:01.809 --> 01:35:02.859
Yes!

1523
01:35:06.299 --> 01:35:07.459
Yo, keep 'em up.

1524
01:35:07.659 --> 01:35:09.339
What I tell you, huh?
Here he comes.

1525
01:35:14.479 --> 01:35:16.429
- Come on, ref.
- Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up.

1526
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:18.989
That cheap shit
all you got, old man?
Can't beat me heads up?

1527
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:35.809
You had enough, boy?

1528
01:35:40.289 --> 01:35:41.589
Tie him up, baby. Tie him up.

1529
01:35:46.419 --> 01:35:47.979
You thought this shit
was gonna be easy.

1530
01:35:58.829 --> 01:36:01.769
What
an exciting close to round two
in the battle of la.

1531
01:36:01.969 --> 01:36:04.309
Both men giving us
some tremendous blows.

1532
01:36:05.309 --> 01:36:06.609
That was better.

1533
01:36:06.809 --> 01:36:08.869
Stay focused. You take him
where you need to go.

1534
01:36:09.069 --> 01:36:10.999
Keep punching through.
Leave him open...

1535
01:36:13.549 --> 01:36:15.879
Don't let this chump
control you.

1536
01:38:36.829 --> 01:38:38.105
What did we just witness?

1537
01:38:38.129 --> 01:38:41.019
An incredible end to round 11.

1538
01:38:41.219 --> 01:38:42.819
This fight feels dead even.

1539
01:38:43.009 --> 01:38:44.719
You can feel the tension.

1540
01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:47.329
This is history spilling
into the ring.

1541
01:38:47.529 --> 01:38:49.609
What an emotionally draining
war here in Los Angeles.

1542
01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:53.309
Listen...

1543
01:38:55.919 --> 01:38:57.559
You out there boxing.

1544
01:38:57.759 --> 01:39:00.169
I need you to start fighting.

1545
01:39:00.369 --> 01:39:01.825
Go out there
and do what we came to do.

1546
01:39:01.849 --> 01:39:03.129
It's your time, champ!

1547
01:39:03.329 --> 01:39:04.389
It's your time to shine!

1548
01:39:04.589 --> 01:39:07.529
Let go of the fear.
You hear me?

1549
01:39:07.729 --> 01:39:09.019
Let go of the guilt.

1550
01:39:09.889 --> 01:39:11.959
Let go of it, dawg.

1551
01:39:12.159 --> 01:39:16.359
Let go of whatever was
and walk into what is.

1552
01:39:16.559 --> 01:39:18.749
Go out there and be ferocious!
Do you hear me?

1553
01:39:18.949 --> 01:39:20.019
Be ferocious!

1554
01:39:20.219 --> 01:39:22.189
Go out there
and be Adonis creed!

1555
01:39:33.909 --> 01:39:36.639
And we're off in round 12.

1556
01:39:36.839 --> 01:39:39.479
Three minutes to decide
the heavyweight championship
of the world.

1557
01:39:44.659 --> 01:39:45.749
Mm-hmm.

1558
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:52.229
Yeah, baby.
Stay in that zone with him.

1559
01:39:59.069 --> 01:40:00.549
Come on, ref!

1560
01:40:05.549 --> 01:40:07.079
There you go, baby.
There you go.

1561
01:40:21.609 --> 01:40:23.079
And creed's down!

1562
01:40:23.279 --> 01:40:24.639
- Neutral corner.
- Get up, Donnie!

1563
01:40:24.799 --> 01:40:26.215
A massive body shot...
Four!

1564
01:40:26.239 --> 01:40:27.359
And he's down on a knee!

1565
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:32.139
- Five!
- Get up, boy!

1566
01:40:34.409 --> 01:40:35.709
Six!

1567
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:39.499
- Get up, boy.
- Seven!

1568
01:40:44.899 --> 01:40:45.939
Eight!

1569
01:40:49.859 --> 01:40:50.899
Get up, d.

1570
01:40:53.819 --> 01:40:54.819
Nine!

1571
01:40:55.819 --> 01:40:56.859
And he's up!

1572
01:40:57.819 --> 01:40:59.549
- Come to me. You all right?
- Yeah.

1573
01:40:59.749 --> 01:41:00.829
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1574
01:41:00.929 --> 01:41:01.985
- Wanna continue?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1575
01:41:02.009 --> 01:41:03.549
There you go! Yes!

1576
01:41:03.749 --> 01:41:05.945
Creed beats the count,
but here comes dame.

1577
01:41:05.969 --> 01:41:07.219
Can he survive?

1578
01:41:10.969 --> 01:41:12.619
Let's go! Give it to him!

1579
01:41:21.629 --> 01:41:22.629
Break, break!

1580
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:25.879
Creed breaks the clinch.

1581
01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:27.749
He fires everything he's got!

1582
01:41:27.949 --> 01:41:30.029
- That's it, d.
- Walking Anderson down!

1583
01:41:30.169 --> 01:41:31.609
It's your time, d!
This is your time!

1584
01:41:53.699 --> 01:41:56.169
Anderson is down!
Anderson is down!

1585
01:41:56.369 --> 01:41:58.669
Yeah! Like that!
How about that?

1586
01:42:00.279 --> 01:42:02.309
Whoa!
Lights out! What a shot!

1587
01:42:02.509 --> 01:42:05.929
Adonis creed is the new
heavyweight champion
of the world!

1588
01:42:10.979 --> 01:42:14.149
Ladies and gentlemen,
this contest comes to an end

1589
01:42:14.349 --> 01:42:18.849
at two minutes and 12 seconds
of the 12th and final round,

1590
01:42:19.049 --> 01:42:21.549
for your winner by knockout.

1591
01:42:21.749 --> 01:42:23.979
The fighting pride
of Los Angeles,

1592
01:42:24.179 --> 01:42:28.549
and once again
the heavyweight champion
of the world,

1593
01:42:28.749 --> 01:42:32.659
Adonis creed!

1594
01:42:47.449 --> 01:42:49.789
Adonis creed has done it.
Yeah!

1595
01:42:49.989 --> 01:42:51.575
- A knockout...
- That's what I'm talking about.

1596
01:42:51.599 --> 01:42:53.879
In the 12th round.
An incredible scene.

1597
01:42:54.079 --> 01:42:56.009
Yeah!

1598
01:42:56.209 --> 01:42:58.275
If there was ever a question
of who is the king of boxing,

1599
01:42:58.299 --> 01:42:59.889
let there be no doubt.

1600
01:43:00.089 --> 01:43:02.599
The creed dynasty
reigns supreme.

1601
01:43:12.089 --> 01:43:14.689
Good. Back training hard,
back getting back focused.

1602
01:43:14.889 --> 01:43:15.889
Back for the next phase.

1603
01:43:16.569 --> 01:43:18.049
We're back in business.

1604
01:43:43.549 --> 01:43:45.029
We'll be in the hall, champ.

1605
01:44:16.059 --> 01:44:18.629
Guess you did learn
a few moves without me.

1606
01:44:35.129 --> 01:44:36.209
Dame, I'm sorry.

1607
01:44:39.219 --> 01:44:40.569
All those years...

1608
01:44:43.609 --> 01:44:44.789
I never checked up on you.

1609
01:44:47.789 --> 01:44:48.789
That's on me.

1610
01:45:01.019 --> 01:45:02.069
We were just...

1611
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:06.109
Kids, bro.

1612
01:45:14.079 --> 01:45:15.379
It ain't on you.

1613
01:45:24.089 --> 01:45:25.089
None of it.

1614
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:31.529
Never was.

1615
01:45:34.579 --> 01:45:35.619
Hey, d.

1616
01:45:39.279 --> 01:45:40.409
It wasn't on you either.

1617
01:46:05.169 --> 01:46:07.439
Aight, go ahead then, man.

1618
01:46:10.129 --> 01:46:11.879
Family and everybody
waiting on you.

1619
01:46:13.529 --> 01:46:14.659
Champ.

1620
01:46:26.929 --> 01:46:28.759
You know where to find me
if you need me.

1621
01:46:52.919 --> 01:46:55.079
You know she's been waiting
all night for this, right?

1622
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:57.959
She looks good in there.

1623
01:46:58.919 --> 01:47:00.749
Yeah.

1624
01:47:04.489 --> 01:47:05.619
- Hmm?
- You all right?

1625
01:47:07.279 --> 01:47:08.279
I'm better now.

1626
01:47:22.509 --> 01:47:24.239
Okay.

1627
01:47:24.439 --> 01:47:26.339
All right.
All right, all right.

1628
01:47:29.519 --> 01:47:31.779
Ready?

1629
01:47:34.779 --> 01:47:38.079
Ow! Ooh.

1630
01:47:38.279 --> 01:47:40.309
- Knock him out.
- Ooh!

1631
01:47:44.789 --> 01:47:46.359
Yeah.

1632
01:47:48.749 --> 01:47:49.969
No!

1633
01:48:03.389 --> 01:48:05.549
Now we have a new champ!

1634
01:48:07.249 --> 01:48:08.989
I'm the champ!

1635
01:48:10.079 --> 01:48:13.039
She's the champ!
She's the champ!

1636
01:48:18.959 --> 01:48:20.119
Home?

1637
01:48:20.319 --> 01:48:21.319
Mm-hmm.

1638
01:48:23.219 --> 01:48:24.309
Yeah.
