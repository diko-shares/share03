Come on, bro.

6
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.780

watched 'em all blossom
and watched 'em grow

17
00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.807
watched the lawsuits
when they lost the dough

18
00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:23.352

19
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.729

94
00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:34.644
You know, actually,
I got you something too.

95
00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:37.105
It belonged to my pops.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:40.734
It's original.

97
00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:42.726

98
00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.654

99
00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:45.947

and then I'm turning pro.

105
00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.799
Don't trip.
You'll be right there with me.

106
00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.844
Shit, someone gotta carry my bags.

107
00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:10.722
Bro, why you gotta
play with me like that, bro?

108
00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.369

111
00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.775
- Pineapple soda?

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.277
All on you, boy. Big money.

113
00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:29.407
Leon?

114
00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.453
Don't remember me, do you?

115
00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.497
Am I supposed to remember you?

116
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.165
Not so little anymore.

117
00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.502
My name's Donnie. You remember me now?

118
00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.342
We're live,
round one, Cape Town, South Africa

119
00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.427
as Adonis creed battles his old rival

120
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.805
in what creed has said
will be his final fight.

121
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.557
Todd Grisham alongside the champion,
Jessica mccaskill.

122
00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:57.769
And right out of the gate
with an impressive combo.

123
00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:00.981
Is Conlan looking this good
or creed looking this bad?

124
00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:02.959
If he doesn't do something fast,

125
00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.776
he's going to end his historic career

126
00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.152
with another loss to Conlan.

127
00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:07.836
- There we go.
- Put thatjab in his face.

128
00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.617
Okay. Same creed. Ain't nothing changed.

129
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:15.930
Conlan stalking his prey,

130
00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.580
pushing creed towards the corner.

131
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.040
You've got to wonder

132
00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:21.167
if the moment is getting to creed here.

133
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.047
Conlan is banging away
with the right hand.

134
00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:27.257
Look to your right.

135
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.151
That seems to be the same combination

136
00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.295
he's throwing over and over,

137
00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.428
and creed can't stop it.

138
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.601
Creed, getting out of the corner.

139
00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.439
Good jab, but Conlan not fazed at all.

140
00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.400
Keep that in his face.
Keep thatjab out there.

141
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.020
- Big left from Conlan.
- Get off that rope.

142
00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.488
Oh, he's got him on the ropes.
Clean shots landing.

143
00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.615
Creed taking quite a beating.

144
00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.453
And wow. Conlan almost had him.

145
00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.748
Next round's gonna hurt, champ.
Next round's gonna hurt.

146
00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:02.250
You okay, Donnie?

147
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.252
Come on, Donnie. You gotta work, baby.

148
00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:07.297
Yo, what you smiling for, dawg?

149
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.299
He over there
beating you worse than last time.

150
00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.551
Like, is there something I missed
that's funny?

151
00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.845
Yeah, man. Checkmate.

152
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.891
Checkmate? Oh, okay.
You sure about that?

153
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.310
I ain't never been scared
of a little contact.

154
00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.854
I'm going out how I came in.

155
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.982
Man, you're crazy, all right.

156
00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.004
- How you feeling?
- I'm just warming up.

157
00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.821
- Looking great.
- He had a good run.

158
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.282
But it's time to take back what's ours.

159
00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.925
Creed's had a remarkable career,

160
00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:54.969
but you wonder if father time
has finally caught up with the champ.

161
00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.721
This is getting dangerous for creed.

162
00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.141
Ooh! The champ finally lands one.

163
00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:03.436
Come on, Donnie.
Work this. Show him who's champ.

164
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.647
Beautiful, Ricky.
Beautiful. Just like that.

165
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.731
One more time.

166
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.000
And down goes Conlan!
He goes down!

167
00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.962
What a moment! And I don't think
he's gonna get up, Jessica.

168
00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:32.799
Three, four, five,

169
00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.843
six, seven...

170
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.136
Eight,

171
00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:37.762
nine,

172
00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:38.847
ten.

173
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:39.764
Yeah!

174
00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.142
And that's it, folks. It's over.

175
00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.477
What a chess move from Adonis creed.

176
00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:45.603
Just incredible.

177
00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.647
What a turn. What an ending.

178
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.524
That's how you go out.

179
00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:52.944
Who would expect anything less
from Adonis creed

180
00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:56.197
as he takes his final bow
on the world stage?

181
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.365
What an exit.

182
00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:59.492
Respect, Conlan.
Hell of a fight.

183
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.578
And that means we've got a new,

184
00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.289
undisputed heavyweight champion
of the world

185
00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.457
for the first time in two decades,

186
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.835
and his name is Adonis creed.

187
00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:07.477
Okay, okay, okay.

188
00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:16.694
Yes. All right.

189
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.521
Just trying...

190
00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:53.940
And I'm...

191
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.858
And I'm trying my best

192
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.444
and I'm trying my best

193
00:12:58.528 --> 00:12:59.696
best.

194
00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:05.118
This is hot.

195
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:06.202
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

196
00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:08.138
This the track you've been
working on for kehlani?

197
00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.372
- Yeah.
- Okay.

198
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.055
We had a good session, but I don't know.

199
00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.244
What you mean you don't know?
Can you send this to me?

200
00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.169
- Yes, yes.
- I need this in the car.

201
00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.379
How was today?

202
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:17.880
- It was good. Yeah.
- Yeah?

203
00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:20.717
- Thank you for holding it down.
- Lgotyou.

204
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.135
Did you get her to bed?

205
00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:23.428
- I did.
- Mmm.

206
00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:26.931
So, I'm not gonna lie. I had to bribe
her with about six scoops of ice cream.

207
00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.349
I don't even know how she sleep.

208
00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.310
Retirement made you soft, you know that?

209
00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:31.686
I can't tell that girl no.

210
00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:34.772
I think you had a couple scoops too
'cause look, you got this.

211
00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:36.399
- Oh. Yeah, that's bad.
- Uh-huh.

212
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:39.110
Yeah. Take that off before it stains, d.

213
00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:41.880
Oh, I see what you're trying to do.

214
00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:43.197
What's that?

215
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:44.741
You're trying to get me naked.

216
00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.624
Oh, no, I'm definitely not trying
to do that 'cause I'm trying to work.

217
00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:50.955
I see what you were trying to do.
No, you can just own it. It's okay.

218
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.540
I know you just wanna see all this.

219
00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:54.343
- No, no, no, no.
- Look at that.

220
00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:57.962
Still hot? Still warm?

221
00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.964
Stop it. I'm working, d. Please.

222
00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.859
I'm working too.
Listen, I don't get a chance to...

223
00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:02.884
What are you working on?

224
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.094
I don't get no alone time with you
no more

225
00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.347
- 'cause you be hard at work.
- I know. Yeah.

226
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.223
- You ain't got no time for me.
- I know.

227
00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:10.350
You ain't got time for...

228
00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.894
- I know, but I don't have time now.
- So come on. You don't?

229
00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:15.229
- No. No.
- Just a little bit. Just a little bit.

230
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.275
Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm.

231
00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.320
Don't you miss when...

232
00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:25.531
We used to... anywhere.

233
00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.200
Any place?

234
00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:30.370
Okay.

235
00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:31.454
Okay, let's go.

236
00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.664
Okay, I just...
I have, like, about 15 minutes

237
00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.833
- because I have to send these stems.
- Fifteen.

238
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.586
- How about 12?
- All right. Twelve will do.

239
00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.594
Next stop, leimert park.

240
00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.192
Body, head. Body, head.

241
00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.832
Efficiency over power, baby.
Give it to him.

242
00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:21.254
Technique. Technique, Felix.

243
00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:23.714
You can't just punch
your way through drago.

244
00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:25.675
We got a plan, so stick to it.

245
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.928
- Come on. Make him work for it.
- Let's go.

246
00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:31.639
It's not only about power.
It's timing, speed.

247
00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.962
- Shit, you're telling me? Come on now.
- I know, I know.

248
00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:35.435
Keep drilling into him.

249
00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:37.061
Technique. Technique.

250
00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:38.896
Time.

251
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.273
Hey! Time!

252
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:42.150
Felix. Get over here.

253
00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.529
These guys are trash.

254
00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.531
We need a new batch,
and we need it fast.

255
00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.992
It's hard.
You've chewed through most of la.

256
00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:53.515
You want me to pull back?
You know drago ain't taking it easy.

257
00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.420
Hey, Felix. Ven aqui.

258
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.607
What's up, champ?
You wanna help me with some rounds?

259
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.550
What, and mess up this suit?
I don't think so.

260
00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:09.552
I'm trying to get you paid, Felix.

261
00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.179
We can't get you paid

262
00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:13.473
if you keep knocking out
all these sparring partners.

263
00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.641
You gotta be ready
to fight drago in four weeks.

264
00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.852
You're the champ. We know you got power.

265
00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.979
But it's not always about
how hard you can hit.

266
00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.482
- It's about control and focus.
- You're right.

267
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.733
Listen to Duke.

268
00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:26.569
Yes, sir.

269
00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.738
See? You play too much.

270
00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:31.216
- Listen to Duke.
- Did you hear that?

271
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.992
"Listen to Duke."

272
00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.870
Those three words. Not "I love you."

273
00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:38.498
Not "take it easy." None of that.

274
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:39.581
"Listen to Duke."

275
00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:42.960
I understand exactly
what they're asking.

276
00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:46.589
Drago's got a bigger name, that's true,
but Felix got the belt.

277
00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.090
His split's got to be bigger.

278
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.594
I don't care if they don't like it.
Tell drago to call me.

279
00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:54.972
Hey, let me call you right back.

280
00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:56.599
Hey, my man.

281
00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:58.935
Can I help you?

282
00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.688
- Let me get an autograph?
- No, I ain't signing no autographs.

283
00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:03.856
But you can get off my car.

284
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.568
Oh, homey.

285
00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:10.655
You don't remember me, huh?

286
00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.451
You come a long way
from bumming rides from your mom.

287
00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:18.412
Dame.

288
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:19.830
Phew!

289
00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.083
Boy, you... you had me.

290
00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.043
Damian.

291
00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:26.045
Yeah, just got back to the hood.

292
00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:28.047
Stopped by the old gym, but...

293
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.758
Yeah, we upgraded
a couple years ago, you know?

294
00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:31.884
I see.

295
00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:37.306
- Damn, it's...
- It's been a minute.

296
00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:39.475
Been a minute.

297
00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.206
I didn't wanna take up
your time or nothing.

298
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.898
I just wanted to let you know
what's good.

299
00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:46.983
I'm around.

300
00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.694
If you wanna catch up,
you know, you just let me know.

301
00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:58.953
Where you about to head now?

302
00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:02.999
Shit, back to the crib.

303
00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:05.751
You got time to get some grub?

304
00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.045
Thank you.

305
00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:10.256
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

306
00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:22.560
I'm surprised you still come here
and eat with the common folk.

307
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.478
I mean, when I can.

308
00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:27.481
There's a lot of things I used to do
that I can't do anymore.

309
00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.025
Busy living that high life, huh?

310
00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.027
Yeah. Guess it comes with the job.

311
00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:33.904
All right.

312
00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:36.282
Yo. Easy, easy. Damn, bruh.

313
00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.325
You know how long it's been
since I had this shit?

314
00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.162
How long?

315
00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:43.039
Eighteen years, bro.

316
00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:46.083
You've been down this whole time?

317
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.256
Had a few years tacked on, but... yeah.

318
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.885
Just got out last week.

319
00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.263
Well, congratulations on that.

320
00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.224
Thank you.

321
00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:05.269
Wrote you a few times.

322
00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:09.357
- You did? Where'd you send 'em?
- Mama creed's.

323
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.487
She still up in bel air?

324
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.072
Yeah, she's still there. Same house.

325
00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:18.282
But I never got 'em.

326
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.833
You know I watched
every one of your fights in the pen.

327
00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.419
You finally made it to Africa, huh?

328
00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:33.130
- You seen that?
- Saw that.

329
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.716
Made me proud how you ended your run.

330
00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:39.762
Look like you still remember
some of them moves I taught you.

331
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.641
You know what I remember?

332
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:46.936
You knocking my ass out.

333
00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:52.650
You know what I remember?

334
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.986
Helping your big head back up.

335
00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:57.697
Remember that?

336
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.575
- Yeah, you did.
- All right, then.

337
00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:08.874
You got work?

338
00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:12.420
I got plans.

339
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.466
Keep my nose clean.
Keep my po off my ass.

340
00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.975
Listen, if there's anything
I can do for you,

341
00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:29.562
if I can help at all, just ask.

342
00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.275
What am I talking about?
You just came home.

343
00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:41.615
Whatever you need. Aight?
Don't hesitate, bruh.

344
00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:46.787
I'm straight, bro.

345
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:48.914
I'm good. I got it all situated.

346
00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.292
I ain't come to see you
for no handout.

347
00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.419
Nah, I didn't mean it like that.
It was...

348
00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:56.380
Respect.

349
00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:01.886
So, what's the plan?

350
00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:04.138
Same program last time you saw me.

351
00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:07.725
I wanna be champ.

352
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:13.814
You still wanna box?

353
00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.775
Hey, I know I've been away a long time.

354
00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:19.570
I kept myself in shape.

355
00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:22.281
I got some moves you ain't seen yet.

356
00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:23.407
Yeah. You...

357
00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:26.994
- You looking diesel.
- I ain't joking.

358
00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:28.954
I'm ready.

359
00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.332
I still got gas in the tank.

360
00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.502
And I gotta get me that chain.

361
00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:37.838
Can't be "diamond" dame looking bummy.

362
00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.008
"Diamond" dame.

363
00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.177
That's right.

364
00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:51.852
All right.

365
00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:53.979
Come by the gym.

366
00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:55.940
Get you set up with Duke.

367
00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:01.612
- For real?
- Yeah.

368
00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.240
For real.

369
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.326
All right, then.

370
00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:11.288
Thank you.

371
00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:32.434
Yo, yo, yo!

372
00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:44.446
What's so funny?

373
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.092
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to convince
your mama to come live with us,

374
00:22:47.116 --> 00:22:49.285
so I can have my own live-in braider.

375
00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:54.623
Yeah. Careful what you wish for.

376
00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:55.875
Oh, I'm not worried.

377
00:22:57.835 --> 00:22:59.461
It's actually not a bad idea.

378
00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:02.631
And how you feeling, mama? You good?

379
00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:03.799
I'm good.

380
00:23:04.884 --> 00:23:06.886
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

381
00:23:06.969 --> 00:23:08.053
Okay.

382
00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:11.515
I'd be better if my son
showed up on time for dinner.

383
00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:13.934
Ouch.

384
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:15.811
Uh, sorry.

385
00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:18.230
- I just got caught up.
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:23:51.597 --> 00:23:54.141
You're gonna have your hands full
with that one.

387
00:23:55.017 --> 00:23:56.310
We already do.

388
00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:59.438
- No. She's the best.
- Yes, we do.

389
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:00.940
She is.

390
00:24:01.023 --> 00:24:02.691
- You're the worst.
- Oh! Come on, mama.

391
00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:05.361
- You're the worst.
- Stop... you don't mean it.

392
00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:07.821
- Here, ma.
- Thank you.

393
00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:10.407
B, think that's a good idea?

394
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:12.076
Baby, not tonight.

395
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:13.511
But we talked about this.

396
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:15.537
- One thing at a time.
- Okay.

397
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.254
Okay. We are not doing this
this evening, okay?

398
00:24:24.338 --> 00:24:26.340
And just so we're straight

399
00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.176
and everybody knows,

400
00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:31.428
I am not leaving my house.

401
00:24:32.513 --> 00:24:33.555
Understood?

402
00:24:33.764 --> 00:24:34.848
Mm-hmm.

403
00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:37.017
- Okay.
- Okay.

404
00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:38.519
And I really am fine.

405
00:24:38.727 --> 00:24:42.064
I promise you, I am not gonna have
another stroke tonight.

406
00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:43.148
Okay?

407
00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:45.693
Have it tomorrow night.

408
00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:47.176
Mom. That's...

409
00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:49.405
That's not funny.

410
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.007
It's a little funny.

411
00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:52.282
And you're not helping.

412
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.660
You know that we're worried about you.

413
00:24:55.202 --> 00:24:56.638
- That's it. We can leave it now.
- _i__.

414
00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:58.539
And we wanna be careful
after the last one.

415
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.499
I am fine.

416
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.251
Okay?

417
00:25:05.087 --> 00:25:06.087
But what about you?

418
00:25:07.089 --> 00:25:08.215
What's up with you?

419
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.009
Yeah. Where were you, d?

420
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.928
Just ran into this guy named dame.

421
00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:15.389
Damian.

422
00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:19.101
Who's he?

423
00:25:24.815 --> 00:25:28.193
Think you might've checked with me?
This ain't no damn charity.

424
00:25:30.237 --> 00:25:31.697
And homey older than you.

425
00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:34.700
I'm just trying to give him a break.
Isn't that what we do anyway?

426
00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:36.785
No! This ain't the ymca.

427
00:25:37.327 --> 00:25:40.664
Look around, Duke. You see anybody
lining up to get in the ring with Felix?

428
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.834
All I'm saying is, let him spar.

429
00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:47.629
Felix got a fight coming up,
and we have zero bodies.

430
00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:50.025
I mean, absolutely nobody wants
to get in the ring with Felix.

431
00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:51.383
I know what you doin', Donnie.

432
00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:54.511
You don't owe this dude shit.

433
00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:57.139
Nothing.

434
00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:00.225
But let's spar.

435
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.227
Let's do it.

436
00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:06.482
Felix, Felix, yo. Listen up.

437
00:26:06.607 --> 00:26:08.287
Adonis brought somebody in
for you to spar.

438
00:26:09.443 --> 00:26:11.111
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

439
00:26:13.447 --> 00:26:14.448
We on.

440
00:26:21.205 --> 00:26:22.498
Lot of young cats in here.

441
00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:24.708
Young man's game.

442
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:27.681
Don't worry,
Duke's gonna take care of you.

443
00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:31.256
We back to ground zero.

444
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.050
Champs gotta start somewhere, right?

445
00:26:39.807 --> 00:26:40.808
All right.

446
00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:45.687
Felix, meet Damian.
He gonna spar with you.

447
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.330
You still remember how to do that, yeah?

448
00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.318
You got this.

449
00:26:51.401 --> 00:26:54.154
Felix, stay focused. Work on timing.
That's all we need.

450
00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:16.969
Well, I'm just asking.

451
00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:50.169
Mm-hmm.

452
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:08.187
So, you wanna teach her how to fight?
That's your advice?

453
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.564
I didn't think I had to,
at a deaf school like that,

454
00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:12.232
- but maybe I was wrong.
- Wait.

455
00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:17.029
What does that mean, "at a deaf school
like that," like they're not still kids?

456
00:28:17.112 --> 00:28:18.572
I mean, what did you expect, Adonis?

457
00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:20.383
Then she should learn
how to defend herself.

458
00:28:20.407 --> 00:28:21.926
Okay, first of all, I'm not saying that

459
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.428
she shouldn't know
how to defend herself.

460
00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:26.492
I'm just saying what that means to me
is different than what it means to you.

461
00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:28.624
What if she's some place
she's supposed to be safe,

462
00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:30.000
and she's not?

463
00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.336
She won't know how to protect herself.

464
00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:34.463
Where's that coming from?

465
00:28:35.797 --> 00:28:38.300
Nowhere. It's just a fact.

466
00:28:40.052 --> 00:28:41.052
Okay.

467
00:28:41.345 --> 00:28:43.305
Another fact is that,
I think, as parents,

468
00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:46.850
it's actually our responsibility
to teach her how to assess her emotions.

469
00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:50.103
So you want Amara, right,
to hold hands with this bully

470
00:28:50.187 --> 00:28:51.980
and start talking about her feelings?

471
00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:53.065
That's not real life.

472
00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:54.417
Okay, what do you want her to do?

473
00:28:54.441 --> 00:28:56.461
You want her to never talk about
her feelings to anyone?

474
00:28:56.485 --> 00:29:00.364
Not even to us, and all she can do
about them is to hit somebody?

475
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:03.259
Look, I know that you think that
that has worked for you,

476
00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:05.118
but now that
you don't have an outlet anymore,

477
00:29:05.202 --> 00:29:07.704
you should think about
maybe talking about how you feel.

478
00:29:07.788 --> 00:29:09.289
If not to me, to somebody.

479
00:29:10.123 --> 00:29:11.917
Or, I don't know, d. Get a hobby.

480
00:29:13.085 --> 00:29:14.544
- Okay, I'll get a hobby.
- Oh, yeah?

481
00:29:14.628 --> 00:29:15.712
Yeah, you.

482
00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:18.816
I'ma go down to the studio.
I'ma start laying tracks with you.

483
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.050
That's not funny, d.

484
00:29:21.468 --> 00:29:24.721
Look, I know that you think that
you are protecting her, baby,

485
00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:27.015
but she has got to know why
she wants to fight,

486
00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:28.267
not just how to do it.

487
00:29:28.517 --> 00:29:31.228
And the only solution to every problem
is not a punch in the face.

488
00:29:31.478 --> 00:29:33.355
Yeah, you're right. And sometimes it is.

489
00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:39.903
All right, let's just have a good time.

490
00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:44.408
Okay, I see you made it all right.

491
00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:47.327
Yeah. I just asked him,
"where the black family live at?"

492
00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:50.539
- I'm kidding.
- Yeah.

493
00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:51.915
- What's up, man?
- Sup?

494
00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:53.834
There's other ones around.

495
00:29:53.917 --> 00:29:55.711
I ain't see none. Here you go.

496
00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:56.795
Thank you.

497
00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:58.755
- Nice to meet you, Ms. Bianca.
- Pleasure.

498
00:29:58.839 --> 00:30:01.133
- You never bought me no flowers.
- What, you want a kiss?

499
00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:03.969
- Nah. I'm okay. No, no, it's all right.
- Come here.

500
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:06.513
- Hey, y'all got a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

501
00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:11.476
You got the see-through floors?

502
00:30:13.103 --> 00:30:14.479
Whoa!

503
00:30:15.188 --> 00:30:16.481
Whoa!

504
00:30:16.606 --> 00:30:17.607
All right.

505
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.193
Amara.

506
00:30:21.278 --> 00:30:22.362
Amara?

507
00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:26.408
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

508
00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:30.037
Nice to meet you.

509
00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:32.456
She says, "you too."

510
00:30:33.206 --> 00:30:34.207
Aw! Hell, yeah.

511
00:30:40.297 --> 00:30:41.340
Thank you again.

512
00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:44.535
Dawg, I still can't get over this.

513
00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:47.554
This square got him a whole mansion.

514
00:30:48.347 --> 00:30:51.224
Married a... a genuine rock star.

515
00:30:51.308 --> 00:30:52.642
- Yeah, I did.
- Mmm.

516
00:30:53.602 --> 00:30:54.978
How many gold records you got?

517
00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:57.689
- I have a few.
- She bein' modest.

518
00:30:57.773 --> 00:30:59.691
She bein' real modest.

519
00:30:59.775 --> 00:31:03.445
No, but it's mostly artists I produce,
but, yeah, I got some.

520
00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.405
- And she produces?
- She does.

521
00:31:05.906 --> 00:31:08.283
Donnie. You punching up.

522
00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:11.953
So, Ms. Producer, when's your next show?

523
00:31:12.037 --> 00:31:14.581
I don't really perform like that
these days.

524
00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:15.749
Yeah, I took a break,

525
00:31:15.832 --> 00:31:19.169
'cause I was having some issues
with my hearing on stage.

526
00:31:19.461 --> 00:31:22.464
And now I'm trying to be careful
and preserve what I've got left,

527
00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:24.800
so, I'm producing.

528
00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:26.968
Yeah.

529
00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:28.804
Not any time soon.

530
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:34.142
Still hard to give that part up, though.
Right?

531
00:31:34.351 --> 00:31:37.187
Yeah. It's not the only thing I love,
but it takes work.

532
00:31:38.063 --> 00:31:39.356
It's an adjustment...

533
00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:40.732
For the both of us.

534
00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:43.026
So, how long have you known each other?

535
00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:46.279
- I mean...
- We go back. Way back.

536
00:31:46.446 --> 00:31:49.449
We was like... we was like brothers.

537
00:31:50.617 --> 00:31:52.369
Shared a room for two years at the Jeff.

538
00:31:54.246 --> 00:31:55.288
Yeah, something like that.

539
00:31:55.372 --> 00:31:58.083
You know how it went.
He went off and got all Hollywood.

540
00:31:58.166 --> 00:31:59.418
The Jeff, right.

541
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:00.794
Yeah, the group home.

542
00:32:02.546 --> 00:32:04.005
You remember them bedbugs?

543
00:32:05.882 --> 00:32:07.300
I try to forget 'em.

544
00:32:07.384 --> 00:32:08.510
Yeah.

545
00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:12.264
I can't forget them bugs.

546
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.144
- I'm gonna get her to bed.
- Okay.

547
00:32:17.227 --> 00:32:19.229
- You two stay, catch up.
- Okay.

548
00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:21.857
Oh, invite him to the label party.

549
00:32:22.023 --> 00:32:23.334
- Definitely will do that.
- Yeah.

550
00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:25.694
I heard that.
I'm invited to the label party.

551
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.339
- You're invited.
- Thank you.

552
00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:30.407
Yeah. Thank you so much for coming.

553
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.076
Yeah, no doubt. My pleasure to meet you.

554
00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:34.286
Mm-hmm.

555
00:32:42.461 --> 00:32:44.981
I can't believe
you moved back out here to the boonies.

556
00:32:45.088 --> 00:32:47.466
You used to love coming out to the hood.
Now you all...

557
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:48.550
What?

558
00:32:49.426 --> 00:32:52.012
- Domesticated and shit.
- Aw, come on, man.

559
00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:53.722
See what happens
when you get married.

560
00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:55.045
- Yeah, all right, bro.
- Aight?

561
00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:57.350
The women run this household.
I just live here.

562
00:32:59.436 --> 00:33:02.355
That's what happens, man.
You get married, a family.

563
00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:04.107
It's crazy.

564
00:33:07.194 --> 00:33:08.195
Pour up.

565
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.584
Can't believe you traded it in
for a monkey suit.

566
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.506
Oh, you know,
a suit has some advantages.

567
00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:34.429
Mmm.

568
00:33:34.513 --> 00:33:36.973
You saying that like I got soft
or something, like...

569
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.368
- Like I lost this sneak-attack.
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

570
00:33:39.392 --> 00:33:41.728
Okay, I see. The champ's still got
some pepper in him.

571
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:44.856
All I'm saying is, I left boxing,
but boxing didn't leave me.

572
00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:48.151
See, that's what I'm saying, bro.

573
00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:52.781
I mean, look, I know
you got a ship to run, and whatnot,

574
00:33:53.615 --> 00:33:56.785
but I ain't keep my stuff together just
to be some punching bag for some chump.

575
00:33:57.452 --> 00:33:58.495
You feel me?

576
00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:00.872
Don't sleep on Felix. Aight?

577
00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:04.042
He got it the hard way. He earned it.

578
00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:07.170
I did 18 years the hard way, bro.

579
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.176
Maybe I ain't make myself clear.

580
00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:17.806
I want a title shot.

581
00:34:18.598 --> 00:34:19.599
Damem.

582
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.894
I don't know what you think,
but it don't work like that.

583
00:34:22.978 --> 00:34:25.730
Felix so cold, what he got to lose?
What you got to lose?

584
00:34:25.814 --> 00:34:28.167
You think I can snap my fingers
and make you a contender overnight?

585
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:29.568
Ain't that what happened to you?

586
00:34:39.369 --> 00:34:40.370
It's like this, bro.

587
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:44.082
I respect you...

588
00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:48.211
But my clock tickin'.

589
00:34:48.378 --> 00:34:49.796
It's now or never for me.

590
00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:53.592
And I wanna help you,
like I said I would.

591
00:34:55.051 --> 00:34:57.304
But, man, what you asking me, it's...

592
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.307
It's kinda impossible.

593
00:35:04.894 --> 00:35:06.605
You don't know what it's like, bro.

594
00:35:09.566 --> 00:35:10.775
All that time in them...

595
00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:13.612
In them walls.

596
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.701
Impossible?

597
00:35:22.537 --> 00:35:23.663
They take your name.

598
00:35:24.581 --> 00:35:25.999
And they give you a number.

599
00:35:28.918 --> 00:35:29.919
That's how it start.

600
00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:34.424
I was the best, though.

601
00:35:35.216 --> 00:35:36.217
Yeah, you were.

602
00:35:37.177 --> 00:35:38.178
I was, bro.

603
00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:41.806
But I never got a chance to prove that.

604
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.143
Look, all I'm saying, bro, if...

605
00:35:45.852 --> 00:35:50.440
Iprollo creed could take a chance
on some underdog...

606
00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:53.276
Why can't you?

607
00:36:06.206 --> 00:36:07.207
Did you sleep okay?

608
00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.420
You were grinding your teeth.

609
00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:16.549
How was the rest of last night?

610
00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:19.219
Mmm.

611
00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:22.097
- It was... it was good.
- Yeah?

612
00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:23.515
Just catching up.

613
00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:27.811
Hey, why didn't you ever tell me
about the group home?

614
00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.358
There wasn't a lot to say.

615
00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:37.654
Hmm.

616
00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:39.447
How old were you?

617
00:36:42.492 --> 00:36:44.285
I was around Amara's age.

618
00:36:48.623 --> 00:36:49.999
You don't wanna talk about it?

619
00:36:51.501 --> 00:36:52.585
It's okay.

620
00:36:55.255 --> 00:36:56.756
- No.
- It's okay.

621
00:36:58.717 --> 00:36:59.801
Nah, it's dame.

622
00:37:01.386 --> 00:37:03.221
You know he asked me to fight Felix?

623
00:37:05.181 --> 00:37:06.182
- For real?
- Yeah.

624
00:37:06.266 --> 00:37:09.686
Heavyweight champion of the world,
and he wants a shot.

625
00:37:10.437 --> 00:37:11.437
So what'd you say?

626
00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:13.981
I said no.

627
00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:16.025
It's impossible, you know?

628
00:37:16.192 --> 00:37:18.194
People wait their whole lives
for a shot like that.

629
00:37:18.278 --> 00:37:19.863
- And he's not even a pro.
- Yeah.

630
00:37:22.449 --> 00:37:24.451
Why does it look like
you're still considering it?

631
00:37:28.037 --> 00:37:29.998
Right. All right.
Work him against the ropes.

632
00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:33.960
Work him. Stay in front of him, baby.
Cut off that ring. Come on.

633
00:37:34.169 --> 00:37:35.503
Ooh!

634
00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:38.631
That's right.

635
00:37:39.966 --> 00:37:42.247
Don't look at me, man.
You on your own in there. Let's go.

636
00:37:42.302 --> 00:37:43.720
Come on, mijo, stay on him.

637
00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:45.323
Keep fighting. Let's go.

638
00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:47.056
Okay.

639
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.685
Okay, baby, come on. Come on.

640
00:37:50.769 --> 00:37:51.770
Okay.

641
00:37:52.479 --> 00:37:53.480
Let's go, grandpa.

642
00:37:54.314 --> 00:37:55.315
Not enough.

643
00:37:58.318 --> 00:37:59.903
Stay focused. Jabs, jabs.

644
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:02.280
Give it to him.

645
00:38:02.781 --> 00:38:04.741
Work yourself out the clinch.
Let's do it.

646
00:38:06.075 --> 00:38:08.578
- Hey! You keep it clean, huh?
- What was that? Hey.

647
00:38:08.661 --> 00:38:09.579
Yo, man.

648
00:38:09.662 --> 00:38:11.766
- What you trying to do, hurt me?
- Walk it off, little man,

649
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.375
- you ain't built like that.
- Who you calling "little man"?

650
00:38:15.043 --> 00:38:16.127
This is my gym, bro.

651
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:17.337
All right, coz. All right!

652
00:38:17.754 --> 00:38:18.963
Get in there. Get in there.

653
00:38:19.047 --> 00:38:20.047
Hey, hey, hey.

654
00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:23.301
Nah. Get back, Damian. Let him go.

655
00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:25.053
Hey! What's going on down here?

656
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:26.471
That was intentional.

657
00:38:26.554 --> 00:38:28.848
- You handle this.
- I am gonna handle this.

658
00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:30.451
D, talk to me. What happened?

659
00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:31.476
Me doing my job.

660
00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:32.644
Hey, come here, man.

661
00:38:33.353 --> 00:38:35.939
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.
Use your head. Okay?

662
00:38:36.022 --> 00:38:38.024
Use your head.
Leave all that other mess outside.

663
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.902
I told you what I want, d.

664
00:38:42.028 --> 00:38:43.708
And I told you
it was gonna take some time.

665
00:38:43.738 --> 00:38:44.739
Time.

666
00:38:45.782 --> 00:38:47.700
All right? Go take a walk.

667
00:38:48.284 --> 00:38:49.285
Get some air.

668
00:38:49.786 --> 00:38:50.787
Aight?

669
00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:53.453
Hey, Adonis.

670
00:38:53.498 --> 00:38:54.791
No... hey, Duke. Calm down.

671
00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:56.227
- This was a mistake.
- I got it under control.

672
00:38:56.251 --> 00:38:57.645
I told you right away it was a mistake.

673
00:38:57.669 --> 00:38:59.128
- I got it.
- You don't!

674
00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:01.798
You let him come in here
with a chip on his shoulder.

675
00:39:01.881 --> 00:39:02.882
That's exactly...

676
00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:05.301
- Well, don't get quiet now, dukie.
- Man...

677
00:39:05.385 --> 00:39:10.014
It's okay. Relax. I know, I got you.
I know. Just let it go. Okay?

678
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:13.017
I got it under control.

679
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.271
He's telling you who he is, right?

680
00:39:16.896 --> 00:39:17.897
Believe him.

681
00:42:01.269 --> 00:42:03.312
I can tell

682
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:08.067
that there's something lurking
in the dark

683
00:42:08.568 --> 00:42:09.861
the dark, yeah.

684
00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:12.613
I can tell

685
00:42:13.614 --> 00:42:17.827
that you're trying to catch me off guard

686
00:42:18.703 --> 00:42:22.540
and I'm trying my best

687
00:42:22.623 --> 00:42:26.544
my best to keep from going under

688
00:42:28.129 --> 00:42:32.800
and it's hard to forget all the rain

689
00:42:32.884 --> 00:42:35.720
when you keep hearing the thunder

690
00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:39.307
and it just feels like

691
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:44.645
shadows keep following me.

692
00:42:53.529 --> 00:42:56.157
Can I get two scotches on the rocks?
All right, thank you.

693
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.326
'Sup, Donnie?

694
00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:01.788
I would've had you.

695
00:43:04.165 --> 00:43:05.625
Okay, maybe not.

696
00:43:05.708 --> 00:43:07.251
Okay, maybe not.

697
00:43:08.628 --> 00:43:11.255
- You look all right.
- You know. You too.

698
00:43:12.006 --> 00:43:14.258
- A sweater.
- I'm... just glad you came.

699
00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:17.095
Binvfled.

700
00:43:17.303 --> 00:43:18.429
True.

701
00:43:21.057 --> 00:43:22.517
Hey, don't worry about them.

702
00:43:23.059 --> 00:43:24.060
I ain't.

703
00:43:24.143 --> 00:43:25.645
It's a party. Have fun.

704
00:43:26.145 --> 00:43:28.481
So many other things in here
you should be looking at.

705
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.027
It's a fire party, bro. Yeah.

706
00:43:34.403 --> 00:43:35.655
Congrats, boy.

707
00:43:38.032 --> 00:43:39.033
You made it.

708
00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:41.494
Now those two: Chavez, drago.

709
00:43:41.702 --> 00:43:43.830
I'm gonna make sure
that's the fight of the year.

710
00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:46.791
Hey, you okay?

711
00:43:48.668 --> 00:43:50.002
I don't need no babysitting, bro.

712
00:43:51.003 --> 00:43:52.421
Aight. I'ma be right back.

713
00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:53.506
Go ahead.

714
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:56.759
Look at my two killers.

715
00:43:56.843 --> 00:43:58.553
I can't wait to get this thing...

716
00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:03.516
Are you ready to do this?

717
00:44:03.683 --> 00:44:05.536
You know I'm always ready.
You don't have to ask.

718
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.228
Okay. Save it for fight night.

719
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.773
We got the venue. We got the money.
We're gonna break records.

720
00:44:10.857 --> 00:44:12.692
Will you send me the tracks, please?

721
00:44:12.775 --> 00:44:13.985
I can't wait to hear them.

722
00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:15.879
We'll talk next week.
It was so nice to meet you.

723
00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:17.155
Congratulations too.

724
00:44:17.989 --> 00:44:19.198
You made it.

725
00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:21.617
- Yep.
- Thank you for coming.

726
00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:22.827
You having fun?

727
00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:24.704
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

728
00:44:24.787 --> 00:44:26.372
- Yeah.
- Good. Me too.

729
00:44:26.455 --> 00:44:28.332
I'm tired of working the room, but...

730
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.293
It's what you do.

731
00:44:30.376 --> 00:44:31.544
Yeah, sometimes.

732
00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:34.172
Guess that's what y'all do.
Look at him over there.

733
00:44:34.255 --> 00:44:35.631
Getting his Don King on.

734
00:44:35.756 --> 00:44:37.341
Minus the hair.

735
00:44:37.425 --> 00:44:38.926
- Thank god.
- Yeah.

736
00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:42.221
You know, that's growth for him.
He used to hate coming to these things.

737
00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:47.351
- How does it feel?
- What's that?

738
00:44:47.977 --> 00:44:49.562
Having somebody else sing your song?

739
00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:50.730
Mmm.

740
00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:52.440
It feels good.

741
00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:56.194
I mean, if it's gotta be anybody,
not bad.

742
00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.040
Yeah, I almost believe you.

743
00:45:01.657 --> 00:45:03.993
How about Donnie?
Think he misses boxing?

744
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:06.579
No. Not that he tells me.

745
00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:09.207
But would he?

746
00:45:13.336 --> 00:45:16.339
Speaking of, you know, there's something
I wanted to ask you actually.

747
00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:19.383
Curious what happened with you two.

748
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.320
Oh, you wanna know how I got locked up.

749
00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:23.596
Yeah.

750
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.431
Boring story really.

751
00:45:25.598 --> 00:45:27.058
Got into a fight.

752
00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:29.769
I had a few priors.

753
00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:31.812
Pulled a gun.

754
00:45:33.314 --> 00:45:34.982
Donnie was there. He can tell you.

755
00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:36.484
You know.

756
00:45:36.859 --> 00:45:38.152
Donnie pop off...

757
00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:43.157
And I ain't even saying
dude ain't deserve it, but...

758
00:45:44.367 --> 00:45:45.368
Who is "dude"?

759
00:45:50.957 --> 00:45:51.958
Okay.

760
00:45:54.126 --> 00:45:55.461
His name was Leon.

761
00:45:57.088 --> 00:45:59.215
The rest of it,
we gonna leave to Donnie to tell you.

762
00:46:00.132 --> 00:46:02.093
Ain't really my place. Feel me?

763
00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:05.221
But it's like you say.

764
00:46:05.304 --> 00:46:07.723
You know, it take work
to look at the past.

765
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.243
- Yo, stop him.
- Drago!

766
00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:10.507
Hey, hey, get that guy!

767
00:46:15.731 --> 00:46:19.819
The LAPD took
this man, Luis camino, into custody...

768
00:46:21.821 --> 00:46:23.656
No, we're not canceling anything.

769
00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:25.658
He's seeing a specialist right now.

770
00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:29.245
They're saying... at least six months.

771
00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:31.872
I know. I know. But we'll figure it out.

772
00:46:31.956 --> 00:46:33.416
Do not move the date.

773
00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:35.166
All right.

774
00:46:35.209 --> 00:46:36.294
High-profile event.

775
00:46:36.377 --> 00:46:39.171
Drago, who's currently
recovering at cedars-sinai,

776
00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.631
suffered a concussion,

777
00:46:40.715 --> 00:46:43.718
as well as multiple fractures
to his right arm and hand.

778
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:46.345
And his injuries now throw into doubt

779
00:46:46.429 --> 00:46:48.073
his participation in next month 's...

780
00:46:48.097 --> 00:46:50.266
Highly anticipated title fight

781
00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:52.018
- against Felix Chavez.
- Hello?

782
00:46:52.101 --> 00:46:53.811
Yes, everything is gonna be fine.

783
00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:55.774
We'll figure it out.
We'll find another fighter.

784
00:46:55.855 --> 00:46:58.149
It's not about
just finding another fighter.

785
00:46:58.232 --> 00:47:00.776
I know, and I understand
your frustrations. I really do.

786
00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:01.986
So, what are you gonna do?

787
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:03.779
He wants to fight drago.

788
00:47:03.946 --> 00:47:06.866
But we can't wait six months
for him to be cleared.

789
00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:10.661
These windows don't last forever.
We need to get him paid now.

790
00:47:12.621 --> 00:47:13.664
All right, there's one,

791
00:47:13.748 --> 00:47:16.167
maybe two other contenders
outside of drago.

792
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.754
There's Ortiz, and then there's sporino.
And he's recovering from his last fight.

793
00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:21.714
Okay, so then who?

794
00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:29.221
I got an idea.

795
00:47:30.389 --> 00:47:34.602
It's risky, but if we pull it off,
it'll be a payday.

796
00:47:35.478 --> 00:47:36.520
What do you have in mind?

797
00:47:36.604 --> 00:47:37.897
He wants you to fight dame.

798
00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.106
Dame?

799
00:47:39.565 --> 00:47:41.525
He's not even a real fighter.

800
00:47:41.609 --> 00:47:43.529
He was real enough
when he was sparring with you.

801
00:47:43.778 --> 00:47:45.196
Hey, Felix, people talk.

802
00:47:45.279 --> 00:47:47.698
Champ, he's older than you. Huh?

803
00:47:47.782 --> 00:47:48.908
You're right.

804
00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:51.494
But dame will fight tooth and nail.

805
00:47:52.078 --> 00:47:54.121
Right now, we gotta think
outside the box.

806
00:47:56.123 --> 00:47:57.625
Oh, you don't like it, huh?

807
00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:58.834
Damian ain't a boxer.

808
00:47:58.959 --> 00:48:00.854
He's fighting the world
and he's trying to hurt people.

809
00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:02.713
No, I don't like it.
I think it'd be a circus.

810
00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:06.425
What he means is
he's gonna put on a show. Okay?

811
00:48:06.509 --> 00:48:08.219
We gotta play the cards
that we're dealt.

812
00:48:08.302 --> 00:48:10.930
But the thing here is, will people come?

813
00:48:11.013 --> 00:48:13.599
Oh, people are gonna show up.
I can promise you that.

814
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:16.477
Everyone loves an underdog story.

815
00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:20.231
You know how many people tuned in
when Apollo gave rocky a shot?

816
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.068
People are still talking
about that fight today.

817
00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:26.070
Champ, listen.

818
00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:29.907
I know it's not what we promised, okay?
I understand.

819
00:48:30.032 --> 00:48:33.577
But if it was me, I'd do it.

820
00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:46.382
Let's do it.

821
00:48:47.133 --> 00:48:48.217
Just let your boy know,

822
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.010
I'ma beat his ass
when I'm in that ring.

823
00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:53.889
Felix, all I want you to do is your job.

824
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:56.976
- Hmm?
- Let's get it.

825
00:49:03.065 --> 00:49:05.651
Since taking over
the famous delphi academy

826
00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:08.696
with his longtime trainer,
and partner, 'little Duke' Burton,

827
00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:14.452
Adonis creed has trained and mentored
the next generation of boxing legends.

828
00:49:14.535 --> 00:49:17.288
Adonis always looked out. We family.

829
00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:20.791
But the brightest Jewel
in creed athletics' crown

830
00:49:20.875 --> 00:49:23.586
is undoubtedly Felix Chavez.

831
00:49:26.255 --> 00:49:28.215
I go in there like if I'm a warrior.

832
00:49:29.425 --> 00:49:32.178
And until I take you out,
I'm not gonna stop.

833
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:35.347
Me and my mother, we wanna
build a legacy, just like they did.

834
00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:36.891
I had my time as a fighter.

835
00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:38.392
Felix is the next generation.

836
00:49:39.477 --> 00:49:42.313
I'm just excited I get a chance
to see the fireworks up close.

837
00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:43.647
Boy is explosive.

838
00:49:43.772 --> 00:49:47.193
Now, creed is staking
his reputation and legacy

839
00:49:47.276 --> 00:49:49.153
on an unlikely new opponent

840
00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:50.237
for Chavez.

841
00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:52.501
Shit, man. Before I got locked up,

842
00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:55.659
I was the highest-ranking amateur
in boxing.

843
00:49:57.536 --> 00:49:58.536
Even.

844
00:49:58.579 --> 00:50:00.539
"Diamond" Damian Anderson was once

845
00:50:00.623 --> 00:50:02.291
a heralded golden gloves champion

846
00:50:02.374 --> 00:50:05.377
from the crenshaw district
of Los Angeles, California.

847
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:08.714
But after almost two decades
behind bars,

848
00:50:08.797 --> 00:50:11.467
he's only now making
his professional debut.

849
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:14.345
It's the longest hiatus in the history
of boxing 'cause I'm back now.

850
00:50:14.762 --> 00:50:17.932
The future of two fighters
hangs in the balance.

851
00:50:18.182 --> 00:50:21.936
Creed athletics is promoting
the most surprising fight of the year.

852
00:50:22.311 --> 00:50:26.524
Will it be a cinderella story,
or another notch on the champion's belt?

853
00:50:29.485 --> 00:50:31.087
[Announced
good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

854
00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:33.614
and welcome to the crypto. Com arena

855
00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:35.699
for tonight's main event.

856
00:50:37.117 --> 00:50:42.039
The stars are arriving for a much hyped
and very unique title match,

857
00:50:42.122 --> 00:50:45.209
brought to you
by showtime and creed athletics,

858
00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:49.213
between the reigning
wbc heavyweight champion, Felix Chavez,

859
00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:53.384
and the virtually unknown challenger,
Damian Anderson.

860
00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:00.432
All right, let's go.

861
00:51:13.362 --> 00:51:14.572
Yeah.

862
00:51:16.991 --> 00:51:17.992
Gentlemen.

863
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:19.118
- Creed.
- Hmm.

864
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:22.204
- Give us a minute.
- Yeah.

865
00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:32.590
Fighting out of the crenshaw district
of Los Angeles,

866
00:51:34.008 --> 00:51:37.428
"diamond" dame Anderson.

867
00:51:37.511 --> 00:51:38.929
Oh, shit.

868
00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:42.766
See they finally got you
out of those chains.

869
00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:44.977
How do I look?

870
00:51:46.604 --> 00:51:47.688
You look lighter.

871
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.111
Thank you.

872
00:51:54.194 --> 00:51:55.487
You ain't gotta thank me.

873
00:51:56.447 --> 00:51:58.866
Just go out there and put on.

874
00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:01.952
For sure.

875
00:52:19.386 --> 00:52:21.805
And now,
ladies and gentlemen in attendance,

876
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:25.142
and boxing fans joining us
around the world,

877
00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:27.311
here we go.

878
00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:31.190
The challenger
this evening, "diamond" Damian Anderson

879
00:52:31.273 --> 00:52:33.484
out of south central Los Angeles.

880
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:41.116
All my life, been grindin' all my life

881
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:43.827
sacrificed, hustle paid the price

882
00:52:44.203 --> 00:52:46.246
want a slice? Got to roll the dice

883
00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:48.957
that's why, all my life,
I been grindin' all my life

884
00:52:49.458 --> 00:52:51.418
all my life, been grindin' all my life.

885
00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:54.588
What is it about
this guy that's so special

886
00:52:54.672 --> 00:52:57.508
that he gets a title shot
his very first fight?

887
00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:00.678
Well, it all hinges on Adonis creed.

888
00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:03.847
Creed says
Anderson is more than up to the task.

889
00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:07.226
But we'll find out for ourselves
in just a moment.

890
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:10.396
Will this be a fairy tale or a massacre?

891
00:53:53.355 --> 00:53:57.025
This guy is
a true product of creed athletics.

892
00:53:57.109 --> 00:54:00.529
Chavez made his presence felt
when he stormed onto the scene

893
00:54:00.612 --> 00:54:03.907
with a string of devastating knockouts.

894
00:54:03.991 --> 00:54:05.200
A proud fighter,

895
00:54:05.284 --> 00:54:09.455
he had one prediction
for this evening's unlikely main event:

896
00:54:09.538 --> 00:54:10.873
Victory.

897
00:54:10.956 --> 00:54:12.916
From the crypto. Com arena,

898
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.253
it's time for the main event
of the evening.

899
00:54:16.336 --> 00:54:18.255
- It's showtime!
- It's okay.

900
00:54:18.338 --> 00:54:19.757
I got it. Thank you.

901
00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:24.136
Introducing to you first, on my right,
making his professional debut,

902
00:54:24.219 --> 00:54:27.598
in an unprecedented attempt
at a world title,

903
00:54:27.681 --> 00:54:30.225
here is the former golden gloves
champion,

904
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:35.981
"diamond" Damian Anderson.

905
00:54:37.191 --> 00:54:42.196
And his opponent across the ring
is the defending world champion.

906
00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:45.282
With a record of 15 wins and one loss,

907
00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:48.827
he has 14 wins coming
by way of knockout.

908
00:54:48.911 --> 00:54:55.876
Introducing Felix "El guerrero" Chavez.

909
00:54:57.294 --> 00:54:59.338
Center ring. Center ring.

910
00:54:59.421 --> 00:55:01.581
Gentlemen, we went over the rules
in the dressing room.

911
00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:04.218
I wanna remind you
to protect yourself at all times.

912
00:55:05.511 --> 00:55:07.387
Obey my commands.

913
00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:09.389
God bless you both.

914
00:55:12.017 --> 00:55:13.018
Touch up.

915
00:55:23.195 --> 00:55:24.363
Chavez! Chavez!

916
00:55:24.446 --> 00:55:26.490
The bell and the start of round one,

917
00:55:26.573 --> 00:55:29.159
here at the crypto. Com arena.

918
00:55:29.326 --> 00:55:32.079
Chavez starts out
aggressive. On the hunt.

919
00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:35.707
Sending a very clear message to Anderson
of what he has in store.

920
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:37.876
But Anderson's keeping a tight guard.

921
00:55:40.379 --> 00:55:41.922
Come on, champ! Let's go.

922
00:55:44.591 --> 00:55:46.677
Don't lay off.
Keep that pressure there, baby.

923
00:55:47.219 --> 00:55:49.137
Chavez paws with that jab there

924
00:55:49.221 --> 00:55:51.348
but Anderson's showing good movement.

925
00:56:01.733 --> 00:56:03.819
Chavez walks him down...

926
00:56:04.152 --> 00:56:06.530
Oh, wow! What an awkward punch.

927
00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:08.240
That looked intentional.

928
00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:09.741
Where all that power go?

929
00:56:09.825 --> 00:56:10.905
It ain't nothing. Let's go.

930
00:56:12.411 --> 00:56:13.412
Hands up, baby. Hands up.

931
00:56:13.495 --> 00:56:15.414
You ain't got nothing I ain't seen, boy.

932
00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:16.748
Okay, grandpa.

933
00:56:17.749 --> 00:56:19.501
You soft. You soft.

934
00:56:25.424 --> 00:56:26.784
Anderson clinches.

935
00:56:26.967 --> 00:56:28.385
Get off the ropes.

936
00:56:29.303 --> 00:56:31.972
Before shelling back up
into that crab guard.

937
00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:35.642
Dame may be new to us,
but he may have some tricks in his bag.

938
00:56:40.272 --> 00:56:42.065
- Come on, ref. Didn't you see that?
- Box!

939
00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:47.070
Some dangerous punches to end the first.

940
00:56:47.154 --> 00:56:50.157
Anderson might need to freshen up
on the rule book, al.

941
00:56:50.324 --> 00:56:51.524
Let's go, Felix.

942
00:56:55.037 --> 00:56:57.397
He thinks he's got you
mapped out because of the sparring...

943
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:59.225
- Stick to the plan.
- I know what I'm doing.

944
00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:01.376
Listen, you fight the fighter,
I fight the refs.

945
00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.128
Don't let this
turn into no kind of brawl.

946
00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:06.173
That's what he wants.
He's trying to agitate you. No. Okay?

947
00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.901
- I got this.
- Let's get out there.

948
00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:08.759
You stole that round.

949
00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:10.111
- Don't get caught up in their stuff.
- Water.

950
00:57:10.135 --> 00:57:12.196
It's the first round and you got bruises
on your face already.

951
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.890
Come on, you're better than that, champ.
Stick to the script, baby.

952
00:57:14.973 --> 00:57:16.451
You get out there and fight the fight

953
00:57:16.475 --> 00:57:17.555
that we worked so hard for.

954
00:57:23.065 --> 00:57:24.876
Round two begins,

955
00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:27.402
and Chavez is already back
on the attack.

956
00:57:29.488 --> 00:57:30.614
There we go, champ.

957
00:57:30.697 --> 00:57:33.241
Feels like Chavez is back in the fight.

958
00:57:42.876 --> 00:57:44.795
Anderson swinging to separate.

959
00:57:44.878 --> 00:57:47.589
Chavez's head from his shoulders.

960
00:57:51.677 --> 00:57:53.261
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

961
00:57:53.929 --> 00:57:54.930
Yo! What is this?

962
00:57:55.013 --> 00:57:56.616
Wow, that looked deliberate.

963
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.557
You! Time!

964
00:57:57.641 --> 00:57:59.744
The ref needs to get control
before this gets out of hand.

965
00:57:59.768 --> 00:58:01.454
- Can you continue?
- Yeah, I'm good. Let's go.

966
00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:02.312
Stay right here.

967
00:58:02.396 --> 00:58:03.748
The only good news for Chavez is that

968
00:58:03.772 --> 00:58:05.941
- that cut is so far below his eye...
- Come here.

969
00:58:06.024 --> 00:58:08.586
- But it's still dangerous.
- Two-point deduction. Intentional elbow.

970
00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:09.653
It's about time, ref.

971
00:58:09.736 --> 00:58:11.905
Two-point deduction. Intentional elbow.

972
00:58:11.989 --> 00:58:13.657
Listen, you keep this up

973
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.801
and you're gonna get yourself
disqualified.

974
00:58:14.825 --> 00:58:16.219
- Do you understand?
- Right. Right.

975
00:58:16.243 --> 00:58:17.244
Stay right there.

976
00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:19.413
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

977
00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:20.998
- If anyone was wondering...
- Box!

978
00:58:21.081 --> 00:58:23.291
What kind of fight this would be,

979
00:58:23.375 --> 00:58:26.837
it seems like
Anderson is out to make this clear:

980
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.172
This is a fight for your life.

981
00:58:30.424 --> 00:58:34.219
Let's hope Chavez can
make it back to his corner and adjust.

982
00:58:34.845 --> 00:58:36.531
Big right hand to end the round

983
00:58:36.555 --> 00:58:40.892
and Chavez sends Anderson to the corner
with something to think about.

984
00:58:40.976 --> 00:58:42.416
Way to finish. Way to finish strong.

985
00:58:47.607 --> 00:58:49.026
Let me get that mouthpiece.

986
00:58:50.777 --> 00:58:51.778
Whoa!

987
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:56.825
Keep grinding, champ. Round after round.

988
00:59:02.164 --> 00:59:04.875
Hey, champ. You good? Can you still go?

989
00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:06.960
Yeah, I'm good.

990
00:59:07.044 --> 00:59:08.545
Okay, he's good. Let's go.

991
00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:10.797
He said he's good.

992
00:59:12.924 --> 00:59:14.509
Listen, pain is temporary.

993
00:59:14.593 --> 00:59:16.779
- Say it back to me. Pain is temporary.
- Pain is temporary.

994
00:59:16.803 --> 00:59:19.514
He a bum! Okay?
And you the champ, right?

995
00:59:19.598 --> 00:59:20.515
I'm the champ.

996
00:59:20.599 --> 00:59:22.839
Let's go, champ.
Keep your hands up. Stay off them ropes.

997
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:28.023
Bring it in.

998
00:59:28.106 --> 00:59:30.859
- That's good. Let's go. Vamos.
- Come on.

999
00:59:31.193 --> 00:59:32.587
Only two rounds down,

1000
00:59:32.611 --> 00:59:35.697
but it's clearly not the fight
any of us expected.

1001
00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:37.407
Stay in it, mijo.

1002
00:59:37.491 --> 00:59:39.451
Another shot to that left arm.

1003
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.248
Things are starting to get very ugly.

1004
00:59:45.332 --> 00:59:47.751
- Chavez is in some serious trouble.
- Hands free. Stop!

1005
00:59:47.834 --> 00:59:49.753
- I gotta take her, d, okay?
- Okay.

1006
00:59:51.129 --> 00:59:52.769
There's no such thing as defeat.
Let's go.

1007
00:59:52.798 --> 00:59:53.983
This is dangerous.

1008
00:59:54.007 --> 00:59:55.842
Anderson swinging
like a wrecking ball...

1009
00:59:55.926 --> 00:59:58.512
- Move. Move!
- And Chavez is getting demolished.

1010
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:11.691
Oh! What a shot
by Anderson. Down goes Chavez.

1011
01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.402
Chavez is not getting back up.

1012
01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:17.572
Oh, no. You don't wanna see that.

1013
01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:19.032
Chavez is down

1014
01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:21.910
- and appears to be badly hurt.
- No, no, no.

1015
01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:23.262
Felix!

1016
01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.539
Ladies and gentlemen,

1017
01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:26.832
our referee in charge,

1018
01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:29.626
- Russell mora, stops the contest.
- Call the paramedics!

1019
01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:31.562
- He is the winner...
- Doc, is he gonna be okay?

1020
01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:33.088
By way of spectacular knockout

1021
01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:38.135
and he is the new unified
heavyweight champion of the world,

1022
01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:42.514
"diamond" Damian Anderson.

1023
01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:45.767
'Sup, bro? 'Sup, bro?

1024
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.603
Right? What?

1025
01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:22.971
All right, Duke.
We gotta make this right.

1026
01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:25.158
- Whatever I can do...
- No. I told you, dawg, already.

1027
01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:27.392
Ain't no making nothing right.
Ain't no "Duke" nothing.

1028
01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:28.727
- I can fix it.
- No!

1029
01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:30.270
You can't.

1030
01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:33.899
You stay away from the gym. You do that.
And stay away for a while.

1031
01:02:03.678 --> 01:02:05.055
Hey, ma.

1032
01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:06.264
How's Felix?

1033
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.227
He's still at the hospital.

1034
01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.187
He's stable.

1035
01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:16.057
I figured I'd get out of there
and give him some space.

1036
01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:17.108
Mm-hmm.

1037
01:02:17.943 --> 01:02:19.152
May be smart.

1038
01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:25.909
What's all this?

1039
01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:30.371
They're from Damian.

1040
01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:46.888
You kept these from me?

1041
01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:48.974
To help you move on, yes, I did.

1042
01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:55.397
Mama, how could you?

1043
01:02:57.941 --> 01:02:59.442
I was trying to protect you.

1044
01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:00.986
Protect me from what?

1045
01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:02.904
Damian was my brother.

1046
01:03:02.988 --> 01:03:04.030
No, Donnie.

1047
01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:07.367
Not in that facility
where you were caged like an animal.

1048
01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.703
Did you think that I was gonna
let you go back to that?

1049
01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:12.080
You made him think I abandoned him.

1050
01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:15.709
Do you know what we went through?

1051
01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.877
I know who that man was
the two of you beat up.

1052
01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.630
You know Leon?

1053
01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:28.679
Yeah.

1054
01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:31.725
Then you know Damian had my back
before you even knew who I was.

1055
01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:34.436
Dame treated me more like family

1056
01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:36.313
than your two kids ever did
in this house.

1057
01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:38.231
And you took that away from me.

1058
01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.358
None of this would've happened
if it wasn't for you.

1059
01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.030
You're absolutely right.

1060
01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:48.742
None of it.

1061
01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.162
You hit hard, Donnie.

1062
01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:55.623
And you can't see.

1063
01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:00.587
There may have been a time
when Damian had your back.

1064
01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.175
But that's not what he's doing now.

1065
01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:24.818
What?

1066
01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:40.460
Excuse me.

1067
01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:43.004
Yo, dame. Dame.

1068
01:04:43.088 --> 01:04:45.090
- Hey, man.
- Get your hands off me.

1069
01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:46.883
Get your hands off me!

1070
01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:49.009
Hold up.

1071
01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:52.305
It's aight. Cool out, bro.

1072
01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:54.808
Give me that.

1073
01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:01.106
That's what we on?

1074
01:05:02.774 --> 01:05:05.360
What's up, Donnie? You all right?
You look tidy, bro.

1075
01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:07.362
Man. Nah, nah, you tell me, bro.

1076
01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:10.323
You've been playing me this whole time.

1077
01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:13.701
Guess you did get them letters, huh?

1078
01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:15.036
Why'd you lie to me?

1079
01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.288
I vouched for you.

1080
01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:20.917
I brought you into my home, bro.
You met my family.

1081
01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.087
I put money up for you.

1082
01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:26.798
Put the gloves on your hands
like you asked.

1083
01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.133
That's enough. You feel me?

1084
01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:33.054
You... you put the gloves on my hands?

1085
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.056
Homey.

1086
01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:37.392
You must be punchy.

1087
01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:42.647
'Cause if memory serves,
you used to carry my gloves.

1088
01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:45.692
Get your shit and get out the gym.

1089
01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.027
Donnie, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1090
01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:49.654
You think I need you?

1091
01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:53.032
No. When I got locked up, I needed you.

1092
01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:57.912
When I came home, yeah, bro,
I needed you.

1093
01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:00.957
But look around, bro.

1094
01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:04.961
- I'm the champ!
- Yeah!

1095
01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:08.089
And I don't need you
for nothing or, or nothing.

1096
01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:12.802
Who alone now?

1097
01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:19.767
Yeah, that's right. Run away.

1098
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.812
Run away.
That's the one thing you still good at,

1099
01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:24.189
baby creed.

1100
01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:30.904
What was that?

1101
01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.823
- What'd you call me?
- Oh, you mad?

1102
01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:37.118
You mad?

1103
01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:42.207
Try spending half your life in a cell
watching somebody else live your life.

1104
01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:46.085
You turned your back on me, homey.

1105
01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:50.965
Hey, but look, don't trip.

1106
01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:53.593
Hey, come here.

1107
01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.094
Remember this?

1108
01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:57.972
This title?

1109
01:06:58.056 --> 01:06:59.265
All this?

1110
01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.560
I'm just getting started,
little brother.

1111
01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:05.522
I'm coming for it all.

1112
01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:08.483
And what's that supposed to mean?

1113
01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:10.735
Are you threatening me?

1114
01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:18.618
Ain't no threats here, bro.

1115
01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:21.037
Just promises here, homey.

1116
01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:24.874
Come here. Let's see.

1117
01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:26.584
- Get your hands off me.
- You all right.

1118
01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:32.422
Yeah.

1119
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:34.842
Help yourself up for once.

1120
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:37.220
See how it feel.

1121
01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.275
Where were you all night?

1122
01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:13.047
You didn't get any of my calls then,
or this morning?

1123
01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:19.554
What happened to your eye?

1124
01:08:19.637 --> 01:08:20.637
Nothing.

1125
01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:24.767
Are you okay?

1126
01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.856
Not today.
I ain't got time for a therapy session.

1127
01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:34.068
Oh, okay.
Well, then what do you have time for?

1128
01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:35.152
Let me know.

1129
01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:37.006
Because I have been trying
to talk to you

1130
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:38.823
for a really long time, Donnie.

1131
01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:40.116
All right?

1132
01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:44.162
Please, can you tell me
what is going on?

1133
01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:46.539
Is it me?

1134
01:08:46.623 --> 01:08:49.459
No. It's nothing to do with you.

1135
01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:58.843
Is it about Leon?

1136
01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:03.389
What? Who told you that?

1137
01:09:05.516 --> 01:09:06.517
Dame.

1138
01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:10.730
Is there something else
you wanna tell me?

1139
01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:17.236
D, you have got to open up
at some point.

1140
01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.656
I don't know what else to tell you.
I need to understand.

1141
01:09:19.739 --> 01:09:21.991
What do you want me to say?
What do you wanna hear?

1142
01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:23.409
Some sad story?

1143
01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:25.373
You're trying to feel sorry for me
or something?

1144
01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:27.705
I don't wanna feel sorry for you!
I wanna understand you!

1145
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:29.832
I wanna know what is going on with you
in my house!

1146
01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:32.502
There's nothing to talk about!
I don't wanna talk about anything!

1147
01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:34.337
I've been trying to forget it!

1148
01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.799
It's dead! Leave it! Leave it!
Let it lie!

1149
01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:40.218
I'm not talking about that shit no more.

1150
01:09:50.061 --> 01:09:51.854
You figure out your shit, d.

1151
01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:57.026
Because what cannot happen
is her seeing you like this.

1152
01:09:58.778 --> 01:09:59.778
Do you understand?

1153
01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.379
Hey, what y'all doing in there?

1154
01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:00.298
Dame! Adonis!

1155
01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:03.062
- Stop!
- Come on! Fight me!

1156
01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:05.782
- I'm sorry!
- You're not so tough, huh?

1157
01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.675
- Leon?
- Huh?

1158
01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:22.779
Don't remember me, do you?

1159
01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:33.581
Hey, get off him!

1160
01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:36.163
Yeah, you know what it is, homey.

1161
01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:47.845
- Step away from the gun.
- It's down. It's down! It's down.

1162
01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.649
- Hey, mama.
- Adonis, baby.

1163
01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:01.192
You gotta get here right away.

1164
01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:02.568
Mama had another stroke.

1165
01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:05.780
They're saying multiple organ failures.

1166
01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:08.407
I don't know, d. I think it's...

1167
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.911
I think it might be time to say goodbye.

1168
01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:15.873
Mama?

1169
01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:21.254
Mom, I'm sorry.

1170
01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:23.798
- What?
- I didn't mean it.

1171
01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:25.799
I didn't mean it.

1172
01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.138
The day I met you.

1173
01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.684
Ooh, that face.

1174
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:36.853
Ooh!

1175
01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:39.313
You were so mad.

1176
01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:44.443
Gonna knock everybody out,
One by one.

1177
01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:47.905
Just like your father.

1178
01:12:50.157 --> 01:12:53.286
That's why he fought so hard.
You know that, right?

1179
01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:55.246
Yeah.

1180
01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:59.917
But you...
You don't have to do that.

1181
01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:03.754
You can find another way.

1182
01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:06.507
Yeah.

1183
01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:10.761
Yeah, another way.

1184
01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:13.139
Another way.

1185
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.808
I was angry.

1186
01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:20.229
I was so angry when you left me, Apollo.

1187
01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:28.654
Why did you leave me alone?

1188
01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.910
Adonis.

1189
01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:37.288
That's his name.

1190
01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:39.498
I'm right here.

1191
01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:42.543
He saved me, Apollo.

1192
01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:48.174
He helped me to forgive you.

1193
01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.217
Mom, I'm sorry.

1194
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:53.262
Just tell me what to do.

1195
01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:00.561
Adonis.

1196
01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:04.065
Adoni...

1197
01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.074
I'm sorry.

1198
01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:41.078
I know.

1199
01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:45.041
It's okay.

1200
01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:46.125
No, it's not.

1201
01:15:47.835 --> 01:15:48.878
It's just...

1202
01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:51.213
When dame came back...

1203
01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:57.803
All this shit came back too.

1204
01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:00.181
I didn't know how to handle it.

1205
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.392
But you were always really good at that.

1206
01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:06.729
Feelings. It comes easy to you.

1207
01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:08.689
Doesn't come easy to me.

1208
01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:10.733
Doesn't.

1209
01:16:12.443 --> 01:16:14.987
I still got a lot of stuff
that I'm trying to figure out,

1210
01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:18.074
and I don't always know
how to talk about it either.

1211
01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:20.343
You know,
Mary-Anne was the closest thing

1212
01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:22.703
I've had to a mom in a really long time.

1213
01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:24.121
I could talk to her.

1214
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.873
Now she's gone.

1215
01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:33.380
And when I stopped performing,
it was really hard to accept

1216
01:16:33.464 --> 01:16:36.759
that my dreams didn't turn out
the way that I imagined that they would.

1217
01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:40.554
And that still hurts me.

1218
01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:44.016
A lot.

1219
01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:49.230
But I just made a choice
to try to move on

1220
01:16:50.231 --> 01:16:52.191
and be happy about what I do have.

1221
01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.656
But it's not easy.

1222
01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:03.661
I just try.

1223
01:17:19.426 --> 01:17:20.469
Leon_.

1224
01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:24.598
Was the dad at the group home

1225
01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:27.351
where I lived with dame.

1226
01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.440
I'm not saying me and dame were angels.

1227
01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:36.402
Okay? But...

1228
01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:40.239
No kid deserves
to get beat on like we did.

1229
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.491
You feel me?

1230
01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:47.621
That night at the liquor store,
I saw Leon.

1231
01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:52.626
And I snapped.

1232
01:17:56.964 --> 01:17:58.299
And I hit him.

1233
01:18:01.135 --> 01:18:02.553
And I kept hitting him.

1234
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.892
And his boys jumped on me.

1235
01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:11.520
So dame pulled a gun.

1236
01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:14.273
Cops pulled up.

1237
01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:16.442
We tried to run.

1238
01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:20.487
Dame got caught. I got away.

1239
01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:24.950
I ran.

1240
01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:27.703
You were a kid.

1241
01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:31.540
You were scared. Anybody would've run.

1242
01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:35.669
And dame had a gun, Adonis.
That's not on you.

1243
01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:38.297
Yeah, but when he went down,
I didn't reach out.

1244
01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:41.675
Inevercahed.

1245
01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:43.636
I didn't write.

1246
01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:52.144
After a while, it felt easier
to pretend like I forgot.

1247
01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:54.438
You know, just...

1248
01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.775
Act like it never happened.

1249
01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:01.445
But that doesn't make you responsible
for how his life turned out.

1250
01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:07.034
You are a good man, Adonis.

1251
01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:09.161
I don't know anymore.

1252
01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:14.041
You have got to try to forgive yourself,
so that you can begin to believe

1253
01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:17.419
that you deserve the life
that you have earned.

1254
01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.130
Because you do.

1255
01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:24.093
Don't let him destroy
everything you've built.

1256
01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:27.680
But, b, he's not gonna stop.

1257
01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:29.098
Then you make him.

1258
01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:33.143
There's only one way
that dame's gonna listen.

1259
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.693
If that's what you gotta do, then...

1260
01:19:41.485 --> 01:19:42.611
All right.

1261
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.880
At 26 and one, he's the former
heavyweight champion of the world.

1262
01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:48.742
One of the greatest fighters
in the history of boxing.

1263
01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:51.161
The one and only Adonis creed
is sitting right next to me.

1264
01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:52.889
Welcome to the show, my man.
How you doing?

1265
01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:54.553
I'm doing okay, man.
Thanks for having me.

1266
01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:56.166
Yeah, thank you for being here.

1267
01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:58.919
You called to be on this show,
which you've never done.

1268
01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:02.506
I wanna know why you felt the need

1269
01:20:02.589 --> 01:20:04.591
to come on national television today
to speak.

1270
01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:05.551
What's on your mind?

1271
01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:07.469
When iwalked away from boxing,

1272
01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:09.596
I walked away
with some unfinished business.

1273
01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.433
Gotta be talking about dame.
Gotta be talking about him.

1274
01:20:12.516 --> 01:20:14.018
Let's just get this out of the way.

1275
01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:17.062
You know I believe you're the best
pound-for-pound fighter in the world,

1276
01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:18.230
three years ago.

1277
01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:19.958
It's been a minute
since you've been out in these streets,

1278
01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:22.294
so maybe you haven't heard
what they've been saying about you.

1279
01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:23.777
Conlan.

1280
01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:25.571
He was beyond his prime
when you beat him.

1281
01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:26.697
Dame.

1282
01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.491
He's the next king of boxing.
Not you. Okay?

1283
01:20:29.616 --> 01:20:31.577
Every time you turn around,

1284
01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.871
dame is talking about you dirty,
and unapologetically.

1285
01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:34.955
Hey, turn that up.

1286
01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:38.000
To anybody who'll listen,
he questions your manhood,

1287
01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.335
he talks about your family.

1288
01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:40.937
He talks about how you can't be trusted,

1289
01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:44.131
- and that you run out on your boys.
- No, no. No. Wait. Let me just...

1290
01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:45.841
Hold on. We got a call coming in.

1291
01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:48.218
We got a call. Put him on, right now.

1292
01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:49.803
Hey, what up, little homey?

1293
01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:51.013
You want a tissue?

1294
01:20:51.472 --> 01:20:53.116
Want me to come on there
and give you a hug?

1295
01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.368
Aight, look, I'm just telling
everybody who you really are.

1296
01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:56.769
How you run out on family.

1297
01:20:57.603 --> 01:21:01.398
Dame, uh, not like this.

1298
01:21:01.982 --> 01:21:03.317
This ain't the way to handle it.

1299
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.527
Oh. Bad news, bro. This is live.

1300
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.446
So, I mean,
this how we gonna handle it now.

1301
01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.531
Little Donnie ain't got nothin'.
He a coward.

1302
01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:11.784
You a coward, bro, and a fraud.

1303
01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.328
I know it. Everybody else know it.

1304
01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:16.997
Hey, Apollo creed would be ashamed.

1305
01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:18.207
Oh, you lost it.

1306
01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:19.750
Aight.

1307
01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:23.128
I challenge you for the heavyweight
championship of the world.

1308
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:24.463
You and me?

1309
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:26.006
- Run it.
- Run it!

1310
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:28.290
Oh, hell, yes.
Y'all heard it here first.

1311
01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:30.052
I know I can't wait for this.

1312
01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:31.470
There you go. What's up, champ?

1313
01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:32.793
- What's going on?
- Prime time.

1314
01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.849
The champ is here!
Y'all better turn it up.

1315
01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:37.101
Here we go, folks.

1316
01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:42.595
Let's get reacquainted.

1317
01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:52.825
Fractured fourth and fifth metacarpals.

1318
01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.243
Both hands.

1319
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:55.828
His eye socket broke.

1320
01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:56.911
Ruptured kidney.

1321
01:21:58.038 --> 01:22:00.207
- His shoulder don't work.
- Torn abductor.

1322
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:02.769
He don't got it no more. He retired.
He probably won't even make weight.

1323
01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:04.878
And remind me,
how many concussions have you had?

1324
01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:13.220
You're old, and you're broken.

1325
01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:16.682
We know dame. Dame gonna have
this damn list memorized.

1326
01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:20.394
He's willing to do anything to win,
so you gotta be prepared for everything.

1327
01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:24.314
We can't turn back the clock,
we can't hide all your flaws,

1328
01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:26.275
but we can make 'em strengths.

1329
01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:34.575
That's it. Two jabs.

1330
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.410
- Come under.
- Slip.

1331
01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:37.493
One-one-two.

1332
01:22:37.536 --> 01:22:38.745
- I got you.
- Let's go, d.

1333
01:22:38.829 --> 01:22:41.874
The higher you get, the harder it gets.

1334
01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:44.710
That's life. That's this run!

1335
01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:45.794
Let's go.

1336
01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.589
Tug-of-war. Old-school.

1337
01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:51.341
Right here. Let's go. Over and over.

1338
01:22:51.425 --> 01:22:52.426
Push.

1339
01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:53.886
Push!

1340
01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:56.930
What you looking back, boy?
Look fonnard.

1341
01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:58.614
Who slips like this? Nobody.
Bring it in.

1342
01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.440
Ain't nobody gonna
take it easy on him, right?

1343
01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:03.395
Come on. Focus up.

1344
01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:11.778
There you go.

1345
01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:14.364
There you go.

1346
01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:17.074
Come on, man.

1347
01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:19.453
Stop thinking so much, man.

1348
01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:21.205
Get your head in the game.

1349
01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:25.959
You see that man right there?
Do you remember him?

1350
01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:29.755
You gotta block out everything
and be in the moment.

1351
01:23:30.047 --> 01:23:32.716
Not the past. Not the future.

1352
01:23:32.966 --> 01:23:33.967
Right now.

1353
01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:37.387
Let's go. Come on.

1354
01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:40.265
Hey.

1355
01:23:41.099 --> 01:23:43.310
- How's the...
- Nah, nah. Don't.

1356
01:23:43.393 --> 01:23:44.394
But you're good?

1357
01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:46.980
Good enough to beat you.

1358
01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:00.868
Keep your hands up.

1359
01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:03.705
Move. Move!

1360
01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:05.999
You can go home, bro.

1361
01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:19.888
Maybe we should take a break.

1362
01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:21.348
Take a break?

1363
01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:24.601
Fighting through all these fears

1364
01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:26.103
mmm-mmm

1365
01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:29.898
all of these scars I bear

1366
01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:32.985
under this rope I wear

1367
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.615
feel like I'm left for dead

1368
01:24:38.991 --> 01:24:41.076
heart so

1369
01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.453
hollow

1370
01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:48.458
look out and I'm alone on the throne

1371
01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:51.253
can't let

1372
01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:55.465
it crumble

1373
01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:02.472
heavy is the head

1374
01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:04.975
that wears the crown.

1375
01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:26.872
Where you goin'?

1376
01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:30.834
I'm just getting started.

1377
01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:37.174
It's that time

1378
01:25:38.342 --> 01:25:39.885
things just ain't the same

1379
01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:41.595
with young Jermaine still underrated

1380
01:25:41.678 --> 01:25:43.013
but far from underpaid

1381
01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:45.223
and those with problems
they fade, the hunger stays

1382
01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:47.768
the stomach rumbles
the humble thunder

1383
01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:50.145
I'm still fueled
by the ones that slumber

1384
01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:52.314
to stand out amongst
the one-hit wonders

1385
01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:55.651
so when the dust settles
and the sun is under the horizon

1386
01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:57.110
y'all should run the numbers

1387
01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:59.321
uh, who the fuck want what with me?

1388
01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:01.698
Hardest south
and I say that reluctantly

1389
01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:04.743
'cause it should go without saying
but y'all playing dumb

1390
01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.787
as far as these rapper go
I'm not feeling none

1391
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:09.164
cold flow is cold in any genre

1392
01:26:09.247 --> 01:26:10.332
with many combinations

1393
01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:12.793
shoot like that boy's sponsor
by under arm our

1394
01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:13.919
reach you a gamer

1395
01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:16.463
arms crossed in coffin
like you was from wakanda

1396
01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:19.007
guys pay for the accumulated
return of Karma

1397
01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:20.926
as seen as me thumbing
through green

1398
01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:22.009
I've become a gardener

1399
01:26:22.052 --> 01:26:23.512
pulling up in a super charger

1400
01:26:23.595 --> 01:26:25.847
meaning two things
like a double entendre

1401
01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:27.974
nigga won't be from
a number nine combo

1402
01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:30.477
not one designer in my ensemble

1403
01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.813
you're tuned to the realist
maybe that ever spill his

1404
01:26:32.896 --> 01:26:34.231
it hot until it's drained

1405
01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:35.524
feel this pain, trust

1406
01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:37.693
sixteen ain't enough
to do it justice

1407
01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:39.569
just caught the fall off
and he'll explain

1408
01:26:39.695 --> 01:26:42.280
is it the end of the chapter?
Happily ever after?

1409
01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:44.991
I bet this gonna be the year
that the Phillies reign, man.

1410
01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:05.178
I see you, boy.

1411
01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:11.935
We're out here working right now!

1412
01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.606
Where is he? Where is he?

01:28:37.771 --> 01:28:38.980
One punch.

1428
01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:41.525
One round at a time.

1429
01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:58.667
Creed! Creed! Creed! Creed!

1430
01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:02.128
Creed! Creed! Creed!

1431
01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:06.049
Creed! Creed! Creed! Creed!

1432
01:29:11.096 --> 01:29:13.431
Vvhoo! Vvhoo!

1433
01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.183

1437
01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:35.991
The fight starts now!

1438
01:31:38.702 --> 01:31:41.121
Introducing first, the challenger.

1439
01:31:41.204 --> 01:31:43.123
Fighting out of the delphi gym

1440
01:31:43.206 --> 01:31:48.503
and proudly representing his home
of Los Angeles, California,

1441
01:31:48.586 --> 01:31:55.385
here is the former light heavyweight
ancl heavyweight champion of the world,

1442
01:31:55.468 --> 01:32:00.265
Adonis creed!

1443
01:32:01.474 --> 01:32:03.101
Creed!

1444
01:32:04.561 --> 01:32:06.479
And his opponent across the ring,

1445
01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:11.943
he represents the crenshaw district
of Los Angeles, California.

1446
01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:15.196
Here is the former golden gloves
champion

1447
01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:19.659
and the reigning, defending, undefeated

1448
01:32:19.743 --> 01:32:24.247
and unified heavyweight champion
of the world,

1449
01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:28.668
"diamond" Damian Anderson!

1450
01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:30.253
Anderson!

1451
01:32:30.336 --> 01:32:31.647
Creed retired a champion,

1452
01:32:31.671 --> 01:32:33.173
but he's definitely the underdog.

1453
01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:35.443
Yeah, there's
no doubt dame has the upper hand.

1454
01:32:35.467 --> 01:32:37.510
He looks to be in phenomenal shape.

1455
01:32:37.594 --> 01:32:40.847
You both received your instructions
in your dressing room.

1456
01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:43.099
I want a good, clean fight.

1457
01:32:43.183 --> 01:32:45.018
Obey my commands at all times.

1458
01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:47.812
Above all, protect yourself
at all times.

1459
01:32:47.896 --> 01:32:48.896
Let's go.

1460
01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.692
You on your own now, little Donnie.

1461
01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:55.562
Go to your corners.

1462
01:32:55.612 --> 01:32:58.907
The intensity here
is like nothing I've ever seen.

1463
01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:02.243
Yeah, you can absolutely feel
the bad blood between each other

1464
01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:03.620
in this battle of la.

1465
01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:08.851
And we're off.

1466
01:33:08.875 --> 01:33:13.296
And the big question here in round one,
how much ring rust will Adonis have?

1467
01:33:13.379 --> 01:33:15.340
Three years out of the game.

1468
01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:17.884
And the way dame attacks,
this could be over early.

1469
01:33:18.718 --> 01:33:21.054
A little bit of a cautious start
early on here.

1470
01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:23.431
Still not clear yet
who's going to be the one dictating.

1471
01:33:23.515 --> 01:33:24.599
Stop holding back, d.

1472
01:33:24.682 --> 01:33:26.351
You're giving him too much respect.

1473
01:33:29.395 --> 01:33:30.623
Anderson gets first blood

1474
01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:33.358
with a nasty shot to the arm of creed.

1475
01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:35.441
Both fighters sizing each other up.

1476
01:33:35.485 --> 01:33:37.737
Ancl, boom,
a stiffjab to the face lands,

1477
01:33:37.821 --> 01:33:39.823
ancl creed is gonna tie him up.

1478
01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:46.162
Keep those hands up! Let's go!

1479
01:33:46.246 --> 01:33:47.890
You gotta commit, d! Gotta commit!

1480
01:33:47.914 --> 01:33:49.082
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1481
01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:03.638
Come on, d!

1482
01:34:05.974 --> 01:34:07.576
I'd give that round to Anderson

1483
01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:08.810
with an impressive start here.

1484
01:34:08.893 --> 01:34:11.229
All right, little Donnie.
I'll see you in a minute.

1485
01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:13.022
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

1486
01:34:14.107 --> 01:34:15.733
Way to hang out there. Wear him out.

1487
01:34:15.817 --> 01:34:18.486
Look, the boy a punk.
He see you not scared.

1488
01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:20.548
Now it's time for him
to start fighting dirty, right?

1489
01:34:20.572 --> 01:34:22.615
Keep your head on tight.
Let him make mistakes.

1490
01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:25.859
He gonna make a lot of them, all right?
And attack those windows when they open.

1491
01:34:26.536 --> 01:34:28.222
You throwing power punches, champ.

1492
01:34:28.246 --> 01:34:30.141
- Pace yourself.
- I know what I'm doing.

1493
01:34:30.165 --> 01:34:31.291
Don't worry about me.

1494
01:34:31.374 --> 01:34:33.251
All that money can't save him.
Believe that.

1495
01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:35.354
You gotta wonder if creed's regretting

1496
01:34:35.378 --> 01:34:37.172
his decision to get back in the ring.

1497
01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:39.799
Retirement sure seems like
it would be a lot more fun.

1498
01:34:41.426 --> 01:34:42.570
Round two undennay here

1499
01:34:42.594 --> 01:34:44.971
in Los Angeles, live on dazn.

1500
01:34:45.054 --> 01:34:47.765
Let's see ifadonis can find
his championship form

1501
01:34:47.849 --> 01:34:49.601
and make a fight out of this.

1502
01:34:55.982 --> 01:34:56.983
Stop running, Donnie.

1503
01:35:01.988 --> 01:35:02.988
Yes!

1504
01:35:06.242 --> 01:35:07.243
Yo, keep 'em up.

1505
01:35:07.327 --> 01:35:09.287
What I tell you, huh? Here he comes.

1506
01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.252
- Come on, ref.
- Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up.

1507
01:35:16.336 --> 01:35:18.796
That cheap shit all you got, old man?
Can't beat me heads up?

1508
01:35:34.687 --> 01:35:35.980
You had enough, boy?

1509
01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:41.778
Tie him up, baby. Tie him up.

1510
01:35:46.449 --> 01:35:48.049
You thought this shit was gonna be easy.

1511
01:35:58.753 --> 01:36:00.522
What an exciting close to round two

1512
01:36:00.546 --> 01:36:01.756
in the battle of la.

1513
01:36:01.881 --> 01:36:04.592
Both men giving us
some tremendous blows.

1514
01:36:05.385 --> 01:36:06.445
That was better.

1515
01:36:06.469 --> 01:36:08.846
Stay focused. You take him
where you need to go.

1516
01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:10.932
Keep punching through. Leave him open...

1517
01:36:13.476 --> 01:36:15.144
Don't let this chump control you.

1518
01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:38.180
What did we just witness?

1519
01:38:38.204 --> 01:38:40.998
An incredible end to round 11.

1520
01:38:41.082 --> 01:38:42.834
This fight feels dead even.

1521
01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:44.752
You can feel the tension.

1522
01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:47.046
This is history spilling into the ring.

1523
01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:50.633
What an emotionally draining war
here in Los Angeles.

1524
01:38:52.385 --> 01:38:53.385
Listen...

1525
01:38:55.847 --> 01:38:56.889
You out there boxing.

1526
01:38:57.557 --> 01:38:59.308
I need you to start fighting.

1527
01:39:00.184 --> 01:39:01.744
Go out there and do what we came to do.

1528
01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:03.229
It's your time, champ!

1529
01:39:03.312 --> 01:39:04.439
It's your time to shine!

1530
01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:07.400
Let go of the fear. You hear me?

Let go of the guilt.

01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:11.946
Let go of it, dawg.

1533
01:39:12.029 --> 01:39:16.033
Let go of whatever was
and walk into what is.

1534

Go out there and be ferocious!
Do you hear me?

1535

Three minutes to decide

01:39:37.722 --> 01:39:39.599
the heavyweight championship
of the world.

1540
01:39:44.687 --> 01:39:46.856
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1541
01:39:50.568 --> 01:39:52.153
Yeah, baby. Stay in that zone with him.

1542

Come on, ref!

01:40:05.458 --> 01:40:07.001

1547
01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:27.647
And he's down on a knee!

1548
01:40:30.566 --> 01:40:32.109
- Five!

1549
01:40:34.529 --> 01:40:35.905

And he's up!

1555
01:40:57.552 --> 01:40:59.470
- Come to me. You all right?
- Yeah.

1556
01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:00.634
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1557
01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:01.740
- Wanna continue?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1558
01:41:01.764 --> 01:41:03.099
There you go! Yes!

1559
01:41:03.182 --> 01:41:05.643
Creed beats the count,
but here comes dame.

1560
01:41:05.726 --> 01:41:07.144
Can he survive?

1561
01:41:10.982 --> 01:41:12.542
Let's go! Give it to him!

1562
01:41:21.701 --> 01:41:22.702
Break, break!

1563
01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:25.913
Creed breaks the clinch.

1564
01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:27.582
He fires everything he's got!

1565
01:41:27.665 --> 01:41:30.001
- That's it, d.
- Walking Anderson down!

1566

Anderson is down! Anderson is down!

1568

Yeah! Like that! How about that?

1569
01:42:00.239 --> 01:42:02.241
Lights out! What a shot!

1570
01:42:02.325 --> 01:42:06.120
Adonis creed is the new
heavyweight champion of the world!

1571
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.128
Ladies and gentlemen,
this contest comes to an end

1572
01:42:14.211 --> 01:42:18.883
at two minutes and 12 seconds
of the 12th and final round,

1573
01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:21.636
for your winner by knockout.

1574
01:42:21.719 --> 01:42:24.013
The fighting pride of Los Angeles,

1575
01:42:24.096 --> 01:42:28.643
and once again
the heavyweight champion of the world,

1576
01:42:28.726 --> 01:42:32.772
Adonis creed!

1577
01:42:47.370 --> 01:42:48.764
Adonis creed has done it.

1578
01:42:48.788 --> 01:42:49.622
Yeah!

1579
01:42:49.705 --> 01:42:51.850
- A knockout in the 12th round.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1580
01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:53.918
An incredible scene.

1581
01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:55.169
Yeah!

1582
01:42:55.252 --> 01:42:58.297
If there was ever
a question of who is the king of boxing,

1583
01:42:58.381 --> 01:42:59.924
let there be no doubt.

1584
01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:02.677
The creed dynasty reigns supreme.

1585
01:43:11.977 --> 01:43:14.855
Good. Back training hard,
back getting back focused.

1586
01:43:14.939 --> 01:43:15.939
Back for the next phase.

1587
01:43:16.732 --> 01:43:18.275
We're back in business.

1588
01:43:43.634 --> 01:43:45.010
We'll be in the hall, champ.

1589
01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:18.753
Guess you did learn
a few moves without me.

1590
01:44:35.186 --> 01:44:36.228
Dame, I'm sorry.

1591
01:44:39.273 --> 01:44:40.483
All those years...

1592
01:44:43.569 --> 01:44:44.862
I never checked up on you.

1593
01:44:47.698 --> 01:44:48.866
That's on me.

1594
01:45:00.878 --> 01:45:02.087
We were just...

1595
01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:06.133
Kids, bro.

1596
01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:15.351
It ain't on you.

1597
01:45:23.943 --> 01:45:25.069
None of it.

1598
01:45:30.282 --> 01:45:31.492
Never was.

1599
01:45:34.537 --> 01:45:35.538
Hey, d.

1600
01:45:39.124 --> 01:45:40.376
It wasn't on you either.

1601
01:46:04.984 --> 01:46:07.403
Aight, go ahead then, man.

1602
01:46:09.989 --> 01:46:11.740
Family and everybody waiting on you.

1603
01:46:13.534 --> 01:46:14.577
Champ.

1604
01:46:26.922 --> 01:46:28.757
You know where to find me
if you need me.

1605
01:46:52.615 --> 01:46:55.326
You know she's been waiting
all night for this, right?

1606
01:46:56.577 --> 01:46:57.828
She looks good in there.

1607
01:46:59.622 --> 01:47:00.623
Yeah.

1608
01:47:04.543 --> 01:47:05.586
You all right?

1609
01:47:07.129 --> 01:47:08.172
I'm better now.

1610
01:47:22.519 --> 01:47:23.687
Okay.

1611
01:47:24.188 --> 01:47:26.607
All right. All right, all right.

1612
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:39.328
Knock him out.

1613
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:46.377
Yeah.

1614
01:47:48.754 --> 01:47:50.089
No!

1615
01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:05.688
Now we have a new champ!

1616
01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:13.278
She's the champ! She's the champ!

1617
01:48:23.455 --> 01:48:24.498
Yeah.

1618
01:49:24.975 --> 01:49:26.769
I've been waiting all my life

1619
01:49:26.852 --> 01:49:28.812
I've been spending all my nights

1620
01:49:28.896 --> 01:49:31.023
contemplating all my trials

1621
01:49:31.106 --> 01:49:33.233
oh, my god this is not overnight

1622
01:49:33.317 --> 01:49:35.486
I've been giving all my soul

1623
01:49:35.569 --> 01:49:37.571
I've been chasing all my goals

1624
01:49:37.654 --> 01:49:39.823
dedication, all I know

1625
01:49:39.907 --> 01:49:41.617
that's how hard I go

1626
01:49:42.076 --> 01:49:45.913
blood, sweat, and my tears
no, I will not surrender

1627
01:49:46.371 --> 01:49:49.583
if you take my lead
then we can fly together

1628
01:49:50.793 --> 01:49:53.962
heaven never seemed at reach
it's now or never

1629
01:49:55.047 --> 01:49:58.634
we got what we need
but we don't got forever

1630
01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.678
