00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:01.026
<i>My name is Archibald...
Archibald Suchot.</i>

2
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.375
<i>I'm an engineer and
I spent more than 10 years in Africa</i>

3
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.569
<i>building every type of useful thing.</i>

4
00:01:08.557 --> 00:01:13.851
<i>By the way, it's in the heart
of Africa that our story begins.</i>

5
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.446
<i>Well, this is not Africa.
This is Connecticut.</i>

6
00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:22.746
<i>And this is the house I lived in
before I mysteriously disappeared.</i>

7
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.450
<i>But that's another story that my grandson
would be more qualified to tell you.</i>

8
00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:29.804
<i>You will see he's a lovely charming kid
who answers to the name of...</i>

9
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:33.948
Arthur!!

10
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.361
Where's he gone to this time?!

11
00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:41.162
And the dog's disappeared too!!!

12
00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:42.729
Alfred!!?

13
00:01:43.273 --> 00:01:46.170
"Oh yes, you'll see,"
"he'll be a great guard dog!"

14
00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:47.553
Alfred!!!

15
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.108
I wonder what exactly
it is he'll be guarding!

16
00:01:56.954 --> 00:01:58.003
Oh...

17
00:01:58.054 --> 00:02:01.027
If you could at least answer when I call!

18
00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:08.035
Arthur?

19
00:02:08.804 --> 00:02:10.003
- Arthur!!
- Ha!

20
00:02:10.028 --> 00:02:11.642
An attack!
Men, come to my aid!!

21
00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:13.696
Calm down!
It's me! Granny!

22
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.269
Sorry!
I was in Africa!

23
00:02:16.343 --> 00:02:18.653
I can tell!
Did you have a good trip?

24
00:02:18.693 --> 00:02:20.859
Fantastic!
I was in a tribe with Grandpa!

25
00:02:20.904 --> 00:02:23.959
Look! Grandpa painted a canvas
that he placed in a circle.

26
00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:26.894
That way the animals pace
round and round it, but can't find us.

27
00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:30.146
- It's like we're invisible.
- Invisible, but not unsmellable!

28
00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:31.708
Did you have your bath this morning?

29
00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:33.331
I was on my way
when I found this book!

30
00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:34.836
- Hmm.
- It's incredible!

31
00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:37.483
It's all the inventions Grandpa made
for the isolated tribes.

32
00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.254
Yes. He was more interested in
African tribes than he was his own!

33
00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:41.933
Look!
He dug a super deep well

34
00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:44.600
and invented a whole irrigation system
out of bamboo poles.

35
00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:48.340
You know, it wasn't Grandpa
who invented that, it was the Romans.

36
00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.399
They called them viaducts.

37
00:02:50.432 --> 00:02:51.575
The Romans?

38
00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:53.315
I never heard of that tribe!

39
00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:57.535
Oh, it's a very old tribe.
The leader was called Caesar.

40
00:02:57.674 --> 00:02:58.755
Like the salad?

41
00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:00.705
Yes, like the salad.

42
00:03:00.877 --> 00:03:04.545
Put that book back where you got it.
We have to go shopping!

43
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.183
Granny, please.
Can I drive on the way back?

44
00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:11.563
I don't know, Arthur.
We'll see.

45
00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:16.483
- Oh, please, Grandpa would always...
- Grandpa's not here and I'm in charge.

46
00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:37.711
- Good day, Mrs. Suchot!
- Oh, officer, hello!

47
00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:39.231
Always a pleasure to see you in town.

48
00:03:39.256 --> 00:03:41.196
Thank you, officer.
Always a pleasure to see you too.

49
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.889
- Good day, officer!
- Good day.

50
00:03:43.194 --> 00:03:46.074
Arthur, um, here,
here's the shopping list.

51
00:03:46.114 --> 00:03:48.827
And I'm, I'm just gonna run
across the street for five minutes.

52
00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.884
So I'll meet you at the check out counter.

53
00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:53.724
- Can I buy some straws?
- Yeah, as many as you like.

54
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.094
- Did he follow you?
- I don't think so.

55
00:04:02.148 --> 00:04:04.299
Perfect!
Perfect!

56
00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:06.359
There!
It's all there.

57
00:04:06.393 --> 00:04:08.533
Perfect, this is wonderful.
Thank you so much.

58
00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:09.854
- What do I owe you?
- Are you crazy?

59
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:10.915
Nothing, nothing at all!

60
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.483
Now, get going before he catches you.

61
00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:14.502
I'm speechless, I don't know how thank you!

62
00:04:14.528 --> 00:04:16.888
By letting me participate!
Nothing could make me happier!

63
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:18.904
- Now, get going!
- Thanks so much.

64
00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:20.805
I'm counting on you
to let me know how it went?

65
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.592
- I will. I'll call you tomorrow!
- Talk to you tomorrow!

66
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:25.198
- Bye.
- Bye.

67
00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:30.852
Oh Arthur!

68
00:04:30.962 --> 00:04:32.632
Arthur, no, no, no it's fine.

69
00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:33.812
You go off and play.

70
00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.119
- Go off while it's still light!
- Sure?

71
00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.452
- Absolutely.
- Thanks Granny!

72
00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:37.646
Sure.

73
00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:42.856
Yes!

74
00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:45.445
Yes!
World champion!

75
00:04:45.628 --> 00:04:46.905
Alfred!

76
00:04:49.194 --> 00:04:51.862
Watch carefully, Alfred!

77
00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:53.431
You are about to witness

78
00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:58.428
the invention of the largest
irrigation system in the county.

79
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.690
Bigger than Grandpa's,
better than Caesar's.

80
00:05:03.823 --> 00:05:07.350
This is Arthur's...

81
00:05:07.577 --> 00:05:09.524
invention!

82
00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.343
Perfect!

83
00:05:22.443 --> 00:05:24.356
By the grace of God!

84
00:05:35.926 --> 00:05:37.094
Yeah.

85
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:40.701
Alfred!
Congratulations!

86
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:43.254
It's a remarkable invention
that'll go down in history!

87
00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:46.048
- Believe me!
- Arthur! Telephone!!

88
00:05:46.088 --> 00:05:47.335
You'll have to excuse me!

89
00:05:47.382 --> 00:05:50.498
Probably the, uh, President calling
to congratulate me.

90
00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:53.882
Hey! I built an irrigation
system like Caesar's!

91
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:55.522
Now the radishes
will grow twice as fast!

92
00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:58.451
Is this my honey pie?!
Who, who is this "Seesher"?

93
00:05:58.485 --> 00:05:59.798
One of Grandpa's colleagues.

94
00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:02.486
But I followed Grandpa's blueprints
and it works really well!

95
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:05.000
I hope you can get here
before nighttimes so you can see it...

96
00:06:05.025 --> 00:06:06.458
- Where are you now?
- Um...

97
00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:08.552
Well, we're still in the city, Arthur.

98
00:06:08.648 --> 00:06:11.059
Oh! Well, I guess you'll see it
tomorrow morning...

99
00:06:11.113 --> 00:06:14.429
Um... No, we, we're not going
to able to make it, Arthur.

100
00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:16.296
But even though we can't be there,

101
00:06:16.322 --> 00:06:18.359
we wanted to tell you
that we're thinking of you...

102
00:06:18.392 --> 00:06:21.611
because today is...
your birthday!!

103
00:06:22.018 --> 00:06:24.231
- Happy Birthday son!
- Happy Birthday son!

104
00:06:24.365 --> 00:06:26.545
Thought we'd forgot, didn't you?

105
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:29.232
But ten years old is a big deal!

106
00:06:29.286 --> 00:06:31.166
You're a big boy now, aren't you?

107
00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:32.882
So how did you like the present?

108
00:06:32.922 --> 00:06:34.809
- We haven't gotten it yet, you idiot!
- What?

109
00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:36.852
No, I fixed it with Granny.

110
00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:40.974
Yes, you can go into town tomorrow
and pick out whatever you like.

111
00:06:41.014 --> 00:06:44.037
Not too expensive!
Just joking, son!

112
00:06:44.197 --> 00:06:45.710
But we'll see you real soon.

113
00:06:45.753 --> 00:06:47.546
And, uh, remember you have yourself a...

114
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:49.280
- Happy birthday!!
- Happy birthday!!

115
00:06:49.327 --> 00:06:51.120
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, moa!

116
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.552
It wasn't the President.

117
00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.629
Happy birthday to you!

118
00:07:04.711 --> 00:07:08.368
Happy birthday to you!

119
00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:13.255
Happy birthday dear Arthur!

120
00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:19.275
Happy birthday to you!

121
00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:23.203
You know what?
You're the best Granny in the world!

122
00:07:23.252 --> 00:07:25.336
And you're the best grandson!

123
00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:27.612
Go on, blow them out!

124
00:07:28.484 --> 00:07:30.163
- Presents first?
- Oh.

125
00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:32.803
Okay.
This is from Alfred.

126
00:07:38.508 --> 00:07:40.228
I never had a new one before!

127
00:07:40.295 --> 00:07:41.675
Thank you Alfred!

128
00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:44.755
No, ah! If you could wait
til you're outside to throw it,

129
00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:47.585
- I'd consider that a favor.
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

130
00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:49.565
And this is from me.

131
00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:54.559
It's beautiful!

132
00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:05.586
How did you manage to bake a cake?
I thought the oven was broken.

133
00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:08.526
Mrs. Kerman from the hardware store
actually made it!

134
00:08:08.566 --> 00:08:09.772
Still like it?

135
00:08:09.832 --> 00:08:11.452
It's fantastic.

136
00:08:11.982 --> 00:08:13.812
Just too big for three.

137
00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:16.558
Don't be too hard on them, Arthur!

138
00:08:16.772 --> 00:08:18.359
They try their best.

139
00:08:18.472 --> 00:08:21.224
I spend my whole year
in boarding school in England.

140
00:08:21.781 --> 00:08:25.888
When I come back for vacation,
they're not even here!

141
00:08:27.281 --> 00:08:31.092
Anyway I'm used to it now,
they're never here for my birthday.

142
00:08:33.945 --> 00:08:35.778
Wait! Make a wish.

143
00:08:36.445 --> 00:08:41.801
I wish that, for my next birthday,
Grandpa will be here to share it.

144
00:08:43.646 --> 00:08:47.522
Better blow them out quick,
you don't wanna eat a wax cake!

145
00:08:51.212 --> 00:08:54.875
Every night this magnificent
sunset was all ours.

146
00:08:54.928 --> 00:08:58.675
It's precisely into this landscape
that your mother came into the world.

147
00:08:58.777 --> 00:09:02.318
While I was having the baby,
your grandfather was painting this.

148
00:09:03.478 --> 00:09:05.770
- Who are they?
- The Bogo-Matassalai.

149
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.900
Your grandfather helped build
an irrigation ditch for them.

150
00:09:08.937 --> 00:09:12.500
And in return, they gave him
a big bag of rubies.

151
00:09:12.627 --> 00:09:14.208
- Really?
- Really.

152
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.361
Oh, I could tell you
stories all night long.

153
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:17.570
Great!
Tell me.

154
00:09:17.617 --> 00:09:19.507
No, not tonight, Arthur.
Maybe, tomorrow.

155
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.632
- Come on
- No, I haven't even cleaned the kitchen.

156
00:09:21.672 --> 00:09:23.679
Please, Granny.
Just a little!

157
00:09:23.739 --> 00:09:25.539
It's my birthday!

158
00:09:25.952 --> 00:09:27.059
Oh.

159
00:09:27.244 --> 00:09:30.159
- Alright, just one minute.
- Ok.

160
00:09:30.677 --> 00:09:33.908
The Bogo-Matassalai were very, very tall.

161
00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:37.839
They say that nature always
balances itself with its opposite.

162
00:09:37.886 --> 00:09:41.746
And for centuries they searched for them,
in order to find perfect harmony.

163
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.865
And did they find them?

164
00:09:42.925 --> 00:09:46.408
Yes. It was another tribe
living right next to them.

165
00:09:46.455 --> 00:09:48.655
And they had this particular trait.

166
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:51.821
They were small as a tooth.

167
00:09:53.809 --> 00:09:57.454
They called them the Minimoys!

168
00:09:58.275 --> 00:10:00.532
Wow!
Did they get along?

169
00:10:00.592 --> 00:10:04.344
Oh, wonderfully!
Soon they were inseparable!

170
00:10:04.442 --> 00:10:08.488
The one side very incredibly tall,
the other incredibly small.

171
00:10:08.522 --> 00:10:11.858
And only together could they
have a complete vision of the world.

172
00:10:11.908 --> 00:10:12.945
Who's this?

173
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:15.132
This is the Princess Selenia.

174
00:10:15.232 --> 00:10:17.773
Daughter of the king of the Minimoys.

175
00:10:18.374 --> 00:10:19.837
She's beautiful!

176
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.817
I mean, this is incredible!

177
00:10:22.857 --> 00:10:25.582
Yes, and the king himself
gave your grandfather

178
00:10:25.607 --> 00:10:28.107
the secret of how to
find him anytime he wanted!

179
00:10:28.173 --> 00:10:32.563
That's what your grandfather said
every time he was a little drunk.

180
00:10:32.876 --> 00:10:35.236
I like the Minimoys, too.

181
00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.784
Now, to sleep!

182
00:10:40.638 --> 00:10:42.195
Sweet dreams.

183
00:11:00.938 --> 00:11:02.803
We miss you, Archibald.

184
00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:05.096
We really do.

185
00:11:32.939 --> 00:11:34.453
Stop!!!

186
00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.392
How you doing, kid?

187
00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.479
Wow! Wow! Ahh!

188
00:11:55.067 --> 00:11:56.488
Nice shot.

189
00:12:17.129 --> 00:12:19.956
Ah! Mr. Davido!
You startled me!

190
00:12:19.996 --> 00:12:23.482
I'm so sorry!
Spring cleaning? Need a hand?

191
00:12:23.522 --> 00:12:25.429
No, thank you.
What do you want this time?

192
00:12:25.466 --> 00:12:26.466
Here it is!
Done!

193
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:27.789
Signed, sealed and delivered.

194
00:12:27.836 --> 00:12:29.049
You didn't waste any time!

195
00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:31.362
I was coincident, really.
I was in church this morning.

196
00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:33.236
You were in church?
I've never seen you there.

197
00:12:33.266 --> 00:12:34.621
Oh, I usually sit in the back.

198
00:12:34.728 --> 00:12:36.828
Modesty really.
You really should have been there.

199
00:12:36.854 --> 00:12:39.128
You would have seen the Mayor,
who confirmed the document

200
00:12:39.168 --> 00:12:41.254
which pronounces
the expiration of your ownership

201
00:12:41.288 --> 00:12:43.274
of this roperty for lack of payment.

202
00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:45.865
The President of the bank,
who transferred your debt to me.

203
00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:48.301
And as amazing as it may seem,
you know who else was there?

204
00:12:48.348 --> 00:12:52.471
The Notary and the Chief of Police
who countersigned the order of eviction.

205
00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:54.898
So you see,
there is not a single signature missing

206
00:12:54.964 --> 00:12:58.367
and if your husband does not sign
this paper within the next 48 hours,

207
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.612
I will be under the obligation to
evict you from this property

208
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.125
whether your laundry is dry or not!

209
00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:05.485
Oh!

210
00:13:05.832 --> 00:13:08.295
You should hang him up
to dry as well!

211
00:13:09.047 --> 00:13:10.610
Are we gonna have to leave the house?

212
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.393
I'm afraid so...

213
00:13:12.472 --> 00:13:15.405
I won't be able to hold off
that vulture Davido much longer.

214
00:13:15.438 --> 00:13:16.678
But what about the treasure?

215
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.033
The rubies that
the Matassalais gave Grandpa?!

216
00:13:19.073 --> 00:13:21.946
Your grandpa hid them
somewhere out there in the yard.

217
00:13:22.006 --> 00:13:23.628
I dug for weeks!
And I...

218
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:26.664
He hid them so well
I haven't been able to find them.

219
00:13:28.556 --> 00:13:29.575
Where are you going?

220
00:13:29.602 --> 00:13:32.732
You think I'm gonna hang around
twiddling my thumbs for forty eight hours?

221
00:13:32.768 --> 00:13:34.758
I'm gonna find the treasure!

222
00:13:36.487 --> 00:13:38.227
Just like his Grandpa!

223
00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:55.275
You should go and find my car
rather than sitting there watching me.

224
00:14:02.996 --> 00:14:04.356
Can I help you?

225
00:14:04.556 --> 00:14:06.650
Oh!
Pardon me!

226
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.433
You came by our house
once and left this.

227
00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:14.107
You said if we ever wanted to get rid
of any furniture or knick knacks...

228
00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:17.253
- Yes?
- Well, I... I, I brought this...

229
00:14:17.296 --> 00:14:19.396
It's from my private collection...

230
00:14:19.465 --> 00:14:22.741
I wondered if it was at all valuable.

231
00:14:23.781 --> 00:14:25.016
Aah...

232
00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:27.261
What is this?
A carnival mask?

233
00:14:27.328 --> 00:14:29.711
No, this is an African mask.

234
00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:32.731
This is... This belonged to the chief
of the Bogo-Matassalai tribe.

235
00:14:32.764 --> 00:14:34.654
- Two bucks.
- Two dollars?

236
00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:37.721
But this is... of inestimable value...

237
00:14:37.758 --> 00:14:39.581
Alright, alright, two fifty.
That's the best I can do!

238
00:14:39.617 --> 00:14:42.304
This kind of exotic object
just isn't selling any more.

239
00:14:42.331 --> 00:14:46.591
People want practical, concrete,
modern stuff, you know.

240
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.074
I can't believe you'd have hidden
the treasure in the yard

241
00:14:52.138 --> 00:14:56.680
without leaving some sort of clue, a note,
something to help us find it!

242
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.663
Malthazar...
The Evil... M.

243
00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:12.356
I hope I have the honour of
meeting you one day, princess!

244
00:15:13.283 --> 00:15:14.829
In the meantime...

245
00:15:15.682 --> 00:15:17.554
Permit me to steal a kiss.

246
00:15:20.755 --> 00:15:22.095
Jealous!

247
00:15:26.901 --> 00:15:28.075
I knew it!

248
00:15:28.498 --> 00:15:30.758
"To get to the land of the Minimoys"

249
00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:32.918
"put your trust in Shakespeare."

250
00:15:33.054 --> 00:15:35.891
Shakespeare?
What tribe's he from?

251
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.595
The house is here...
South is that way.

252
00:15:46.016 --> 00:15:47.879
The tree! The elf!

253
00:15:47.952 --> 00:15:49.659
The moon!
It's all there!

254
00:15:49.726 --> 00:15:51.846
Alfred! We found it!
Yes!!

255
00:15:51.932 --> 00:15:53.399
- Ah!
- Hang on there, young man!

256
00:15:53.446 --> 00:15:55.264
Arthur, how many times
do I have to tell you?

257
00:15:55.306 --> 00:15:57.131
I don't want you playing in this room.

258
00:15:57.178 --> 00:15:59.234
- Excuse me, please, go ahead!
- Thank you...

259
00:15:59.282 --> 00:16:00.294
- Granny?
- What?

260
00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:02.581
- Who are these guys?
- This gentleman is going to

261
00:16:02.608 --> 00:16:04.308
evaluate some of
your grandpa's things.

262
00:16:04.367 --> 00:16:06.338
Granny?! You're not gonna sell
grandpa's things?!

263
00:16:06.371 --> 00:16:08.230
Oh, I'm afraid I don't
have any choice anymore!

264
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.397
Yes we do!

265
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.523
Look! It's the map
to get to the Minimoys!

266
00:16:11.557 --> 00:16:12.718
- What map?
- They're here!

267
00:16:12.751 --> 00:16:14.724
Grandpa brought them back
from Africa with him!

268
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.270
If we can get to them, I'm sure
they can lead us to the treasure!

269
00:16:17.317 --> 00:16:18.974
Arthur you're a big boy now, right?

270
00:16:19.014 --> 00:16:20.941
You don't really believe
there are little elves

271
00:16:20.974 --> 00:16:22.941
running around the garden
just waiting for you to visit

272
00:16:22.974 --> 00:16:24.796
so they can slap
a bag of rubies in your hand!

273
00:16:24.821 --> 00:16:25.981
Pardon me?

274
00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:27.217
Euh... Nothing.

275
00:16:27.277 --> 00:16:29.444
I was just chatting
with my grandson.

276
00:16:29.478 --> 00:16:31.038
If you have jewels,
we are interested.

277
00:16:31.078 --> 00:16:33.651
Unfortunately, not a jewel on the horizon.

278
00:16:33.705 --> 00:16:35.458
Go to your room, now.

279
00:16:36.517 --> 00:16:38.100
"Some words may hide others".

280
00:16:38.133 --> 00:16:40.278
William. S.
"S" for Socrates?

281
00:16:40.384 --> 00:16:42.933
Shakespeare.
William Shakespeare.

282
00:16:42.973 --> 00:16:44.633
Oh.
Not too far off!

283
00:16:44.708 --> 00:16:49.032
Yes. Better hurry and make your choice
before I change my mind.

284
00:16:49.132 --> 00:16:50.158
- Come on.
- Granny...

285
00:16:50.198 --> 00:16:51.352
Let's go.
Let's go!

286
00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:52.652
Three hundred dollars.

287
00:16:52.722 --> 00:16:55.382
It's not very much for
thirty years of memories!

288
00:16:55.453 --> 00:16:57.603
A down payment! If I sell them well,
you'll have more.

289
00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:58.903
Thank you.

290
00:17:00.055 --> 00:17:01.728
- Mrs. Suchot?
- Yes.

291
00:17:01.815 --> 00:17:03.328
Frederic De Saint-Clair.

292
00:17:03.382 --> 00:17:05.135
Process server.
Bailiff.

293
00:17:05.168 --> 00:17:07.276
Hmm. It seems I came
at an opportune time.

294
00:17:07.382 --> 00:17:09.331
I have a claim for debt collection
which concerns you,

295
00:17:09.356 --> 00:17:11.852
for non-payment of services
rendered by a certain Mr. Davido,

296
00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:14.445
Ernest, for the amount of
two hundred fifty two dollars.

297
00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.312
Now with the six percent
late penalty surcharge,

298
00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:17.746
and procedural fees added,

299
00:17:17.777 --> 00:17:21.495
that comes to a total of two hundred
ninety five dollars and five cents.

300
00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:23.508
May I?

301
00:17:29.108 --> 00:17:30.555
Here's your change.

302
00:17:31.613 --> 00:17:33.049
- Hello?
- Sweetie it's Mom.

303
00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:34.523
- Is everything alright?
- Great.

304
00:17:34.569 --> 00:17:35.669
We're cleaning up today!

305
00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:38.509
It's amazing how much old stuff
just piles up around the place.

306
00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:40.753
But, thanks to Granny,
who threw it all out!

307
00:17:40.813 --> 00:17:43.093
Arthur!
Don't upset your parents!

308
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.671
Did you hang up on your mother?

309
00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:46.270
Of course not! It hung up by itself

310
00:17:46.296 --> 00:17:47.810
Well, she'll call back in a second!

311
00:17:47.843 --> 00:17:49.823
Granny! They've cut the phone line!

312
00:17:49.863 --> 00:17:51.498
Don't you see what's happening?

313
00:17:51.591 --> 00:17:52.950
We've fallen into their trap,

314
00:17:52.984 --> 00:17:55.649
and it's closing in on us
a little bit more every minute!

315
00:17:55.763 --> 00:17:59.308
But as long as I live and breathe,
they're not gonna get this house!!!

316
00:18:00.069 --> 00:18:03.403
There you see?
That's probably the repairman.

317
00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:05.845
- Good evening ma'am!
- You came at just the right time!

318
00:18:05.871 --> 00:18:07.620
Our phone's just been cut off

319
00:18:07.645 --> 00:18:09.699
and I really think you
should warn people!

320
00:18:09.733 --> 00:18:11.746
I agree, ma'am,
but I'm not from the phone company,

321
00:18:11.779 --> 00:18:13.099
I'm from the electric company.

322
00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:16.522
And I came to tell you that you're gonna
be cut off soon for non payment.

323
00:18:21.344 --> 00:18:23.539
Some words may hide others...

324
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.743
Grandpa, help me...

325
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.157
When am I gonna get cut off?

326
00:18:29.477 --> 00:18:31.570
That's what I call a clear answer.

327
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.853
Don't move, I'll get a candle.

328
00:18:39.843 --> 00:18:43.472
Some words may hide others...

329
00:18:43.728 --> 00:18:45.261
Of course!

330
00:18:45.803 --> 00:18:47.483
<i>My dear Arthur.</i>

331
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:50.510
<i>I was sure I could count
on you to find my riddle.</i>

332
00:18:50.675 --> 00:18:53.353
<i>You must be at least ten
to have become so clever.</i>

333
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.986
<i>I, on the other hand,
have not been so clever.</i>

334
00:18:56.028 --> 00:18:57.766
<i>And if you are reading this,</i>

335
00:18:57.988 --> 00:18:59.586
<i>I am probably dead.</i>

336
00:18:59.825 --> 00:19:04.035
<i>Therefore, the heavy task of
accomplishing my mission now falls to you.</i>

337
00:19:04.095 --> 00:19:06.755
<i>- If you accept it, that is.</i>
- I accept, Grandpa.

338
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.860
<i>I knew you would.
Bravo!</i>

339
00:19:08.893 --> 00:19:10.980
<i>To get to the land of the Minimoys,</i>

340
00:19:11.093 --> 00:19:14.333
<i>you must know on which day
the next passage will fall.</i>

341
00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:15.991
<i>There's only one per year.</i>

342
00:19:16.124 --> 00:19:18.777
<i>Take the universal calendar from my desk.</i>

343
00:19:18.831 --> 00:19:22.471
<i>The night of the tenth moon,
at precisely midnight,</i>

344
00:19:22.534 --> 00:19:24.851
<i>the moonlight-passage will open...</i>

345
00:19:26.107 --> 00:19:30.541
<i>If you follow my instructions,
you will have the world in your hands.</i>

346
00:19:30.624 --> 00:19:33.097
August, the 3rd.

347
00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:36.029
That's today!

348
00:19:37.606 --> 00:19:39.502
Night brings good counsel, Arthur.

349
00:19:39.562 --> 00:19:40.749
We'll sleep on it...

350
00:19:40.794 --> 00:19:43.069
Tomorrow will bring a solution.

351
00:19:43.194 --> 00:19:45.388
- Good night, Granny.
- Goodnight.

352
00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:52.335
The world in my hands...
World in my hands...

353
00:19:53.602 --> 00:19:56.301
<i>On the right side of the chimney,
there's a button.</i>

354
00:19:56.368 --> 00:20:00.138
<i>Turn it all the way to the right
and then turn it back to the left.</i>

355
00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:02.841
Only twenty minutes before midnight.

356
00:20:04.272 --> 00:20:05.851
I've got to do something.

357
00:20:10.492 --> 00:20:14.079
<i>As soon as you can,
go to my office if the door is open.</i>

358
00:20:15.519 --> 00:20:19.133
<i>If it's locked, it's because
your grandma has been around.</i>

359
00:20:19.255 --> 00:20:21.835
<i>You'll have to work it out by yourself.</i>

360
00:20:51.254 --> 00:20:52.448
Ah!

361
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.311
I thought you were in the shower!

362
00:20:54.364 --> 00:20:57.011
No, I was in the living room
looking for my sleeping drops.

363
00:20:57.044 --> 00:20:59.251
And if you don't get back
into bed this second

364
00:20:59.286 --> 00:21:01.517
I'm gonna make you
drink the whole bottle!

365
00:21:01.867 --> 00:21:02.927
Go!

366
00:21:04.634 --> 00:21:06.314
Go on! Go on!

367
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.356
You know. I don't like to do this.

368
00:21:17.389 --> 00:21:18.756
But I'm, I'm gonna lock you in.

369
00:21:18.816 --> 00:21:20.823
I don't want you to do
anything stupid tonight.

370
00:21:20.856 --> 00:21:22.830
- Okay.
- Okay.

371
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:17.819
Alfred, what're you doing?
Go to sleep.

372
00:22:18.536 --> 00:22:20.926
Is it the full moon or what?

373
00:22:22.469 --> 00:22:24.239
Thank you, Alfred.

374
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:36.944
Aaaah!

375
00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:43.561
Granny!?

376
00:23:01.539 --> 00:23:03.518
"Always keeps this key with you."

377
00:23:08.513 --> 00:23:11.263
The garden, the tree,
the telescope...

378
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.603
Oh my god!

379
00:23:19.066 --> 00:23:20.603
I need more light!

380
00:23:25.729 --> 00:23:28.002
I've seen Granny do this a hundred times.

381
00:23:33.325 --> 00:23:34.855
Oh, yeah, the brake...

382
00:23:40.658 --> 00:23:42.634
Ah!
Ah!!

383
00:23:45.341 --> 00:23:46.694
Whoa!

384
00:23:47.694 --> 00:23:50.204
No! No!!!

385
00:23:55.122 --> 00:23:56.627
Perfect!

386
00:24:01.176 --> 00:24:02.615
Sorry, old man!

387
00:24:28.087 --> 00:24:29.712
Now for the dolls.

388
00:24:50.726 --> 00:24:52.373
Alfred!

389
00:25:03.225 --> 00:25:04.351
Arthur?

390
00:25:04.745 --> 00:25:06.716
Uh, yeah.

391
00:25:07.492 --> 00:25:09.976
- Follow me!
- Oh, okay...

392
00:25:17.785 --> 00:25:18.971
Hi.

393
00:25:48.683 --> 00:25:49.839
Time to go.

394
00:25:49.936 --> 00:25:51.739
You, you're not coming?

395
00:25:52.769 --> 00:25:54.526
Only one can pass through.

396
00:25:54.843 --> 00:25:58.108
and you seem to us to be
the best choice to combat Evil M.

397
00:25:58.229 --> 00:25:59.746
MALTHAZAR?

398
00:26:00.482 --> 00:26:02.294
Never, never speak that name.

399
00:26:02.387 --> 00:26:04.513
- It brings bad luck.
- Okay, okay.

400
00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:06.925
Your grandfather went off to defeat him.

401
00:26:07.102 --> 00:26:09.945
And now it's up to you
to continue his fight.

402
00:26:10.158 --> 00:26:11.398
Thanks for the honor, but...

403
00:26:11.448 --> 00:26:14.031
I think it might be better
if I leave my place to one of you.

404
00:26:14.081 --> 00:26:16.485
I mean, you're so much bigger
and stronger than me.

405
00:26:16.548 --> 00:26:18.709
Your heart is the strongest of weapons.

406
00:26:18.792 --> 00:26:20.176
Okay.

407
00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:24.499
First ring, for the body...

408
00:26:24.607 --> 00:26:26.493
three times...

409
00:26:27.367 --> 00:26:29.052
to the right.

410
00:26:29.927 --> 00:26:31.866
The second ring, for the mind

411
00:26:31.914 --> 00:26:33.533
three times...

412
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.307
to... the left.

413
00:26:36.719 --> 00:26:38.119
And the third ring...

414
00:26:42.499 --> 00:26:44.399
One whole turn...

415
00:26:46.257 --> 00:26:47.811
for the soul.

416
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:49.838
Ah!!

417
00:26:52.124 --> 00:26:53.837
There!
The door is open!

418
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:55.164
You can introduce yourself!

419
00:26:55.245 --> 00:26:56.311
Introduce myself?

420
00:26:56.371 --> 00:26:59.438
Yes, and try to be convincing
because you only have five minutes.

421
00:26:59.479 --> 00:27:03.702
Alright! Be convincing!
Okay! Okay!

422
00:27:13.158 --> 00:27:15.112
Euh, there's a...

423
00:27:15.951 --> 00:27:17.213
With...

424
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.102
Archibald?

425
00:27:22.248 --> 00:27:23.311
No, no.
No.

426
00:27:23.364 --> 00:27:24.935
Introduce yourself!

427
00:27:25.512 --> 00:27:28.472
Euh, I'm his grandson.
My name is Arthur.

428
00:27:28.543 --> 00:27:29.638
And you are...

429
00:27:29.693 --> 00:27:31.880
Saimono Matrodoy de Betameche.

430
00:27:31.947 --> 00:27:34.006
- Right.
- But you can call me Beta.

431
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.179
Pleased to meet you, Beta.

432
00:27:36.212 --> 00:27:38.246
I hope you have a good reason
for using the beam like that,

433
00:27:38.292 --> 00:27:40.139
because the Council
has strictly forbidden it.

434
00:27:40.189 --> 00:27:41.732
Go on! Go on!

435
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:44.169
This is a matter of extreme urgency!!

436
00:27:44.259 --> 00:27:46.575
In just two days' time,
the garden will be destroyed!

437
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.995
What are you talking about, young man?!

438
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:49.469
Are you a practical joker,
like your grandfather?

439
00:27:49.502 --> 00:27:51.176
This is no joke, Mister Betameche.

440
00:27:51.361 --> 00:27:54.787
A building contractor wants to flatten
the land and build apartment blocks!!

441
00:27:54.821 --> 00:27:56.561
Ah!
What are apartment blocks?

442
00:27:56.623 --> 00:27:59.183
Enormous houses built from concrete

443
00:27:59.223 --> 00:28:02.530
that will cover up all the gardens and,
and stop the flowers from growing!

444
00:28:02.603 --> 00:28:03.817
Heuh?!
But that's awful!!

445
00:28:03.857 --> 00:28:06.293
The only way to prevent this
is for me to find the treasure

446
00:28:06.327 --> 00:28:08.519
that my grandfather
has hidden somewhere!

447
00:28:08.579 --> 00:28:11.842
Then I'll be able to pay off the contractor
and none of this will happen!

448
00:28:11.869 --> 00:28:13.229
Well, that's a really good idea!

449
00:28:13.262 --> 00:28:14.895
All's well that ends well!
See ya!

450
00:28:14.942 --> 00:28:16.125
No, no!

451
00:28:16.165 --> 00:28:18.365
To do that,
I need to pass into your world.

452
00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:20.067
So I can start looking for the treasure!

453
00:28:20.096 --> 00:28:21.550
Heuh?!
That's not possible!

454
00:28:21.576 --> 00:28:23.170
You can't make a journey just like that.

455
00:28:23.203 --> 00:28:24.526
The council must first be assembled,

456
00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:26.757
then you must explain your problem to them,
and they will then deliberate and...

457
00:28:26.784 --> 00:28:30.339
And in two days' time the land
will be flattened and you'll all be dead!

458
00:28:30.423 --> 00:28:32.469
- This is an extreme emergency.
- Yes.

459
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:33.709
And we have to act now

460
00:28:33.743 --> 00:28:36.289
because the future of
your people is in your hands!

461
00:28:36.343 --> 00:28:38.122
Yes, you're right in my hands.

462
00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:39.913
This calls for action!

463
00:28:39.972 --> 00:28:42.293
Ferryman! Ferryman!
Wake-up, it's an emergency!

464
00:28:42.686 --> 00:28:43.779
You did well!

465
00:28:43.826 --> 00:28:46.169
I hope it will be enough
to convince him!

466
00:28:49.105 --> 00:28:51.226
Betameche?!
You little good-for-nothing!

467
00:28:51.266 --> 00:28:54.392
Don't you have anything better to do
than go around waking up honest people?

468
00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:55.942
But it's the light!
It has been reactivated!

469
00:28:55.967 --> 00:28:56.995
What?
Again!?

470
00:28:57.036 --> 00:28:58.956
Why does everyone want
to suddenly travel?!

471
00:28:58.988 --> 00:29:00.990
- The last one was three years ago.
- Exactly, that's what I mean.

472
00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.177
I was just starting to nod off.

473
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.591
Hurry up.
The boy needs to see the King!

474
00:29:03.616 --> 00:29:05.500
The King! The King!
First, the moon!

475
00:29:05.604 --> 00:29:07.993
Is it full now?
Perfect, perfect!

476
00:29:08.071 --> 00:29:09.766
And now for the rings...

477
00:29:10.205 --> 00:29:11.212
So...

478
00:29:11.265 --> 00:29:13.312
three turns to the right for the body...

479
00:29:15.508 --> 00:29:18.188
Three turns to the left for the spirit.

480
00:29:19.223 --> 00:29:21.856
And now, one whole turn for the soul.

481
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.520
W... What's happening to me?!

482
00:29:30.636 --> 00:29:33.320
You are going to join our brothers,
the Minimoys!

483
00:29:33.436 --> 00:29:36.564
- They will lead you to the Seven Kingdoms.
- Help! Stop!

484
00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:38.606
- You only have thirty-six hours!
- Granny!

485
00:29:38.652 --> 00:29:40.159
At noon on the day after tomorrow,

486
00:29:40.186 --> 00:29:43.436
the gateway will close again
for 1000 days!

487
00:29:43.716 --> 00:29:47.062
Thirty six hours...
I'll do my best!

488
00:29:47.445 --> 00:29:48.985
Good luck, Arthur.

489
00:30:01.475 --> 00:30:03.455
The key!
You have the key?

490
00:30:03.515 --> 00:30:06.298
The key?
Yeah, I have the key!

491
00:30:08.705 --> 00:30:10.651
Ok. Now go over to the lock.

492
00:30:10.706 --> 00:30:11.898
The lock?

493
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.130
That has to be it.

494
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.070
Good! Good!
Now turn the key...

495
00:30:21.046 --> 00:30:22.413
I'm gonna die!!

496
00:30:22.493 --> 00:30:23.612
Yes!

497
00:30:24.133 --> 00:30:29.243
No, no, no, no, nooo! Aaaaah!

498
00:30:38.065 --> 00:30:39.901
Welcome to the Land of the Minimoy!

499
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:42.181
It's not funny!
You really scared me!

500
00:30:42.235 --> 00:30:43.835
I thought I was going to die in that...

501
00:30:43.883 --> 00:30:45.101
Oh...

502
00:30:46.865 --> 00:30:48.662
- That's incredible!
- What's incredible?

503
00:30:48.765 --> 00:30:51.339
I dunno, just look at my clothes,
they've changed!

504
00:30:51.372 --> 00:30:52.693
You can admire yourself later.

505
00:30:52.713 --> 00:30:53.999
The council's waiting for you.

506
00:30:54.024 --> 00:30:55.719
Come on, follow me!

507
00:30:56.614 --> 00:31:00.074
I think I'd like to take a little nap.

508
00:31:13.579 --> 00:31:14.607
How far've they got?!

509
00:31:14.632 --> 00:31:17.192
You're joking?
They've only just started.

510
00:31:33.994 --> 00:31:36.494
Princess Selenia!

511
00:31:43.861 --> 00:31:45.252
My little girl.

512
00:31:45.314 --> 00:31:46.492
Father!

513
00:31:46.728 --> 00:31:47.799
Sorry.

514
00:31:47.865 --> 00:31:51.795
Princess Selenia, may the spirits
of the Ancients guide you.

515
00:31:55.427 --> 00:31:56.659
- Papa!!!
- Heuh!

516
00:31:56.879 --> 00:31:57.961
Yes?

517
00:31:57.986 --> 00:31:58.992
Papa!

518
00:31:59.026 --> 00:32:00.572
- Where are you?
- I'm over here!

519
00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.746
Ah!
My son!

520
00:32:01.793 --> 00:32:03.357
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

521
00:32:03.382 --> 00:32:05.560
Couldn't you have waited ten seconds
before playing the clown?!

522
00:32:05.587 --> 00:32:06.770
I'm on a mission of great importance!

523
00:32:06.795 --> 00:32:09.358
Aah?? Because my mission isn't
of great importance, is that it?

524
00:32:09.383 --> 00:32:11.022
You're far too arrogant
to be able to free the sword!

525
00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:12.082
You know you are!

526
00:32:12.107 --> 00:32:14.022
Enough!
Stop bickering, the two of you!

527
00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:15.930
Betameche!
I hope you have a good reason

528
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.845
for daring to disrupt
this important ceremony.

529
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.586
I do father! The Upperlands Light Beam
was activated today.

530
00:32:22.214 --> 00:32:23.721
Who is this uplander?

531
00:32:23.759 --> 00:32:24.789
His name is Arthur.

532
00:32:24.821 --> 00:32:26.071
He's the grandson of Archibald.

533
00:32:26.096 --> 00:32:28.294
And he says a great misfortune
is about to befall us...

534
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:29.926
Our great misfortune has a name.

535
00:32:29.951 --> 00:32:31.031
The Evil M.

536
00:32:31.064 --> 00:32:32.781
And we have no need of
this Arthur person.

537
00:32:32.808 --> 00:32:34.267
As the Princess of royal blood,

538
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.092
the task of protecting
our People falls to me.

539
00:32:37.443 --> 00:32:39.209
- Heuh!
- Yes, but...

540
00:32:39.723 --> 00:32:40.911
Okay.

541
00:32:48.367 --> 00:32:49.994
- Will she make it?
- No.

542
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:51.476
It's moving!

543
00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:54.042
I have it, I have it!
I can feel it!

544
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:57.856
- She's never gonna make it.
- I don't think she's gonna make it.

545
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.567
See? Told you so.
Way too arrogant.

546
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.173
While the Princess gets
her second wind,

547
00:33:08.215 --> 00:33:10.580
perhaps, we should hear
this young man.

548
00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:19.148
Where does he come from?

549
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:21.357
Oh!
He's so cute!

550
00:33:23.178 --> 00:33:24.245
Cute huh?

551
00:33:24.288 --> 00:33:25.611
Ordinary.

552
00:33:27.184 --> 00:33:29.276
My humble respects,
Princess Selenia.

553
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.858
- Who told him my name?
- My humble respects, Princess Selenia.

554
00:33:31.883 --> 00:33:32.936
- I'm sure it was you.
- Hey!

555
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:34.163
You're only one
that knows this Arthur.

556
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:35.636
Oh, yeah.
You can't keep a secret.

557
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:38.264
My humble respects,
Your Majesty.

558
00:33:38.757 --> 00:33:40.977
Eum, eum, yes.
 My respects...

559
00:33:41.017 --> 00:33:43.479
Oh, Arthur.
I am delighted to meet you.

560
00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:45.829
I was a good friend of
your Grandpa, Archibald!

561
00:33:45.869 --> 00:33:47.063
Miro, leave him alone!

562
00:33:47.102 --> 00:33:48.775
Well young man,
we're all ears!

563
00:33:48.817 --> 00:33:50.557
It's like this:
In just under two days,

564
00:33:50.597 --> 00:33:53.634
some men are going to come and
destroy my house, my garden, my world.

565
00:33:53.667 --> 00:33:54.853
- And your world.
- And you...

566
00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.393
All two and a half millimeters of you,
you've come to save us, is that it?

567
00:33:57.437 --> 00:33:59.488
The only way to stop these men
is to pay them off!

568
00:33:59.522 --> 00:34:01.792
This is why my grandfather
came to you three years ago.

569
00:34:01.852 --> 00:34:05.171
He was looking for a treasure and
I've come to complete his mission.

570
00:34:05.251 --> 00:34:07.451
Your grandfather was a remarkable man.

571
00:34:07.525 --> 00:34:09.283
He taught us so many things!

572
00:34:09.338 --> 00:34:12.622
He was the one who showed Miro
how to harness image and light.

573
00:34:12.798 --> 00:34:15.967
Then one day he left,
in search of his famous rubies.

574
00:34:16.031 --> 00:34:17.914
After wandering through the seven lands,

575
00:34:17.941 --> 00:34:21.178
which make up our world,
he finally found it.

576
00:34:21.284 --> 00:34:23.980
Deep in the heart of
the city of Necropolis,

577
00:34:24.015 --> 00:34:28.487
where he reigns supreme...
The Evil M.

578
00:34:28.554 --> 00:34:32.810
And unfortunately, no one ever returns
from the Forbidden Lands.

579
00:34:32.991 --> 00:34:34.120
So...

580
00:34:36.535 --> 00:34:38.315
Look out to the central gate!!

581
00:34:44.588 --> 00:34:47.080
It's Gondolo,
the Juggler of the Great River.

582
00:34:47.395 --> 00:34:50.430
We thought he was lost forever
in the Forbidden Lands...

583
00:34:51.275 --> 00:34:52.442
Stop!!

584
00:34:53.494 --> 00:34:54.587
What's wrong, Arthur?

585
00:34:54.616 --> 00:34:57.647
Sire, look over there.
It looks as if a piece is peeling off.

586
00:34:57.716 --> 00:34:58.808
I think it's a trap.

587
00:34:58.867 --> 00:34:59.949
That's a painted canvas.

588
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.990
My grandfather used to do this in Africa
to protect himself from wild animals...

589
00:35:03.017 --> 00:35:04.091
Well, we're not wild animals

590
00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:06.403
and we're not going to leave
this unhappy creature to die.

591
00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.384
Here, make yourself useful!

592
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.146
Oh my god!
Gondolo...

593
00:35:13.826 --> 00:35:15.185
Oh...

594
00:35:16.858 --> 00:35:18.378
- Selenia!
- Yes.

595
00:35:18.452 --> 00:35:19.572
Take it easy, Gondolo.

596
00:35:19.612 --> 00:35:21.582
It's... a trap!

597
00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:29.998
Oh!

598
00:35:32.727 --> 00:35:34.260
Oh my god!

599
00:35:35.877 --> 00:35:37.330
Mosquitos!

600
00:35:37.637 --> 00:35:38.664
Arthur!

601
00:35:38.697 --> 00:35:39.864
Close!
Close the gate!!

602
00:35:39.897 --> 00:35:41.670
Charge!!!

603
00:35:57.628 --> 00:35:59.021
Go get them!

604
00:36:01.744 --> 00:36:02.912
Come on!

605
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:11.816
Ready to fire!

606
00:36:16.854 --> 00:36:18.134
Watch out!

607
00:36:18.977 --> 00:36:21.044
Follow me to the palace!

608
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.610
- Hurry, father!
- Yes, yes, I'm coming.

609
00:36:23.663 --> 00:36:24.837
Ohh!

610
00:36:29.277 --> 00:36:30.430
Oh!

611
00:36:30.503 --> 00:36:32.803
I am so sorry.
I'm so clumsy.

612
00:36:36.838 --> 00:36:38.531
A... Ahem.
Perfect timing...

613
00:36:38.558 --> 00:36:40.418
I rather fancied
stretching my legs a little.

614
00:36:40.458 --> 00:36:42.011
Father!
Go and take cover, quickly!

615
00:36:42.043 --> 00:36:44.363
Out of the question!
It's a king's duty to face his destiny

616
00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:47.379
and if only one person is left standing,
I will be that person.

617
00:36:49.213 --> 00:36:50.533
Ha!

618
00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:52.609
- Hi.
- Ha!

619
00:36:52.808 --> 00:36:54.849
- We have to go on fighting!
- Sure, but with what?!

620
00:36:54.874 --> 00:36:56.695
Take my weapon.
I'll find another one!

621
00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.440
This is not working.

622
00:37:07.751 --> 00:37:10.504
Gentlemen, it's time to face up to reality.

623
00:37:12.624 --> 00:37:14.169
Watch out!
The walls are booby trapped.

624
00:37:14.237 --> 00:37:16.486
Fly close to the roof.
It's much safer.

625
00:37:16.546 --> 00:37:18.200
I couldn't agree with you more.

626
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.343
Come on, my lovebirds!

627
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.223
This is your chance to prove
you really love each other.

628
00:37:21.256 --> 00:37:22.269
Here you go.

629
00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:24.569
Okay, we'll let them have one final kiss.

630
00:37:25.978 --> 00:37:27.878
Okay, that's enough now!

631
00:37:30.035 --> 00:37:33.182
When I blow my whistle, release your Romeo
so he can get back to his Juliet.

632
00:37:33.219 --> 00:37:34.455
Okay.

633
00:37:37.201 --> 00:37:38.697
Break formation!

634
00:37:39.438 --> 00:37:40.831
Whooaa!

635
00:37:48.444 --> 00:37:49.684
Oh no!

636
00:37:54.995 --> 00:37:56.072
Hi!

637
00:37:59.675 --> 00:38:01.048
You wanna play!

638
00:38:06.811 --> 00:38:08.464
Okay, here we go.

639
00:38:13.827 --> 00:38:15.123
Come on!

640
00:38:16.497 --> 00:38:19.130
Right, this can't be more complicated
than driving a car!

641
00:38:19.177 --> 00:38:21.030
Whooaa!!!

642
00:38:21.084 --> 00:38:22.464
Aahh!!

643
00:38:24.524 --> 00:38:26.757
Beta!
Look out!

644
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.497
Arthur!
I'll never forget you!

645
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:46.813
No, you fool!

646
00:38:46.893 --> 00:38:49.266
No, it's not feeding time!

647
00:38:50.946 --> 00:38:52.880
No... Not the gap!!

648
00:38:52.953 --> 00:38:54.350
Not the gap!!

649
00:38:54.843 --> 00:38:56.043
Oh!

650
00:39:11.101 --> 00:39:13.075
Ok, here we go again.

651
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.003
That's it.
I've got it!! Ouuah!

652
00:39:17.067 --> 00:39:18.776
And one mosquito down!!

653
00:39:25.653 --> 00:39:27.923
Yeah that's better.
Now let's go for it!

654
00:39:27.969 --> 00:39:30.116
How brave he is.
How heroic!

655
00:39:30.166 --> 00:39:32.189
It's amazing how much he's just like me!

656
00:39:32.214 --> 00:39:33.369
He'd make a good partner for you.

657
00:39:33.403 --> 00:39:34.859
Father, I'm old enough
to look after myself.

658
00:39:34.885 --> 00:39:36.352
Forget it.
Forget it.

659
00:39:38.122 --> 00:39:40.531
Oh!
So who's next in line?

660
00:39:46.531 --> 00:39:48.667
- Oh no!
- Oh yes!

661
00:39:48.774 --> 00:39:50.614
- Betameche!
- Arthur?

662
00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:51.701
Do something!

663
00:39:51.731 --> 00:39:53.534
Hang on, Arthur.
I'm coming!

664
00:40:04.549 --> 00:40:06.529
What a gift he is!!

665
00:40:09.063 --> 00:40:11.559
Come to think of it,
he does remind me of you.

666
00:40:12.506 --> 00:40:13.999
You okay?
Nothing broken?

667
00:40:14.046 --> 00:40:16.673
I'm not sure,
I can't feel anything on my butt.

668
00:40:16.986 --> 00:40:18.026
Just one question.

669
00:40:18.073 --> 00:40:19.569
Where did you learn to fly like that?

670
00:40:19.636 --> 00:40:21.596
Umm...
Driving with my grandfather.

671
00:40:21.649 --> 00:40:23.102
That makes sense.

672
00:40:24.326 --> 00:40:26.380
Ahh!
Mogoth, king me.

673
00:40:26.766 --> 00:40:28.678
Uh...
For being clueless...

674
00:40:28.899 --> 00:40:30.385
that went rather well.

675
00:40:33.101 --> 00:40:34.514
Hmm...

676
00:40:35.047 --> 00:40:37.714
Prepare to witness
the wrath of Mogoth.

677
00:40:38.757 --> 00:40:39.997
Whooaa... Oohh.

678
00:40:40.043 --> 00:40:42.063
Hold on. Not now.
Get up. Mogoth!

679
00:40:42.128 --> 00:40:43.924
Selenia!
The Master wishes to see you.

680
00:40:43.964 --> 00:40:45.357
Follow us and no harm will come to you!

681
00:40:45.397 --> 00:40:47.124
- Come and get me!
- Right, go on, grab her!

682
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:48.443
- Why me?
- Well, who else?

683
00:40:48.494 --> 00:40:50.410
- Well, you for example!
- Me? Why me?

684
00:40:50.503 --> 00:40:52.057
Four of you attacking one woman!

685
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.993
- Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
- No.

686
00:40:54.033 --> 00:40:56.593
- Pick on someone your own size!
- With pleasure.

687
00:40:56.693 --> 00:40:57.903
Long live the King!

688
00:40:57.941 --> 00:40:59.863
Oh, my daughter!

689
00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:10.545
My child,
I must do something.

690
00:41:10.599 --> 00:41:11.898
Cover me!

691
00:41:12.352 --> 00:41:13.812
Thank you.

692
00:41:19.574 --> 00:41:21.521
The sword of power.

693
00:41:25.986 --> 00:41:27.480
It's a miracle!

694
00:41:29.943 --> 00:41:31.526
Okay.
That's enough now.

695
00:41:31.578 --> 00:41:34.160
Get on your knees and
beg the Princess for forgiveness.

696
00:41:34.201 --> 00:41:35.394
Hhh!

697
00:41:44.283 --> 00:41:47.647
I said: On your knees
and beg the Princess.

698
00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.094
Forgive us, Princess Selenia.

699
00:41:53.144 --> 00:41:54.720
I don't think we heard that.

700
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:58.619
Our humblest apologies,
Princess Selenia.

701
00:41:58.693 --> 00:42:00.245
Hhh!
I'll think about it.

702
00:42:01.762 --> 00:42:04.227
That's my daughter,
just like her mother.

703
00:42:04.463 --> 00:42:06.603
- You fought like a prince.
- Thanks.

704
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.909
This sword seems so light.
It all seems so easy.

705
00:42:08.942 --> 00:42:10.019
Of course, it's a magic sword.

706
00:42:10.044 --> 00:42:13.108
It's been embedded in that rock for years
and you're the one who released it.

707
00:42:13.145 --> 00:42:14.390
- Really?
- Oh yes, my friend.

708
00:42:14.417 --> 00:42:15.684
You're a hero now.

709
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:17.663
Arthur the hero!

710
00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:19.613
Arthur the hero!

711
00:42:20.387 --> 00:42:22.582
Arthur the hero!

712
00:42:22.921 --> 00:42:25.536
Long live Arthur the hero!

713
00:42:25.582 --> 00:42:28.363
Long live Arthur the hero!

714
00:42:28.621 --> 00:42:31.613
Long live Arthur the hero!

715
00:42:34.956 --> 00:42:37.203
Father! Now that the sword
has been freed from the stone,

716
00:42:37.236 --> 00:42:38.263
we must act fast.

717
00:42:38.288 --> 00:42:40.369
I would like your permission
to continue my mission.

718
00:42:40.403 --> 00:42:42.613
Unfortunately, I have to
agree with you, my child.

719
00:42:42.653 --> 00:42:44.539
But I must insist on one condition.

720
00:42:44.587 --> 00:42:45.706
What condition is that?

721
00:42:45.752 --> 00:42:48.588
Arthur is brave and his heart is pure.

722
00:42:48.687 --> 00:42:49.756
He will go with you.

723
00:42:49.799 --> 00:42:51.829
If that is what you wish, father.

724
00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.085
Well done Arthur.

725
00:42:54.899 --> 00:42:57.532
I'm sure you're going
to make a fine team.

726
00:43:16.851 --> 00:43:17.977
The way is clear

727
00:43:18.023 --> 00:43:19.416
Are you sure that
you haven't forgotten anything?

728
00:43:19.443 --> 00:43:20.976
I'm sure.
Go ahead. Let go.

729
00:43:21.023 --> 00:43:22.052
Oh, oh, oh, ah!

730
00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.234
Father, do we really have
to take Betameche with us?

731
00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.980
Even if your brother is still young,
one day he will be older...

732
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.403
Arthur, if you should encounter
a small mole wearing glasses

733
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:33.748
who answers to the name of Mino
on your travels, he's my son.

734
00:43:33.773 --> 00:43:36.113
He's been missing for
some three months now.

735
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:37.600
You can count on me.

736
00:43:37.714 --> 00:43:39.777
Oh, thank you, Arthur.

737
00:43:40.116 --> 00:43:41.264
Hey, hero.
Let's go.

738
00:43:41.301 --> 00:43:42.837
Hey!
Wait for me.

739
00:43:44.737 --> 00:43:46.630
You could at least wait for me!

740
00:43:48.287 --> 00:43:51.344
Boy, I do hope they won't
fall into any traps.

741
00:44:01.958 --> 00:44:04.498
I slept like a rock.

742
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:14.277
Arthur, time to get up.

743
00:44:31.687 --> 00:44:34.260
Selenia, slow down a bit, can't you?

744
00:44:34.287 --> 00:44:36.853
No way! It's your fault for
loading yourself up like a gamallus!

745
00:44:36.878 --> 00:44:39.140
I just packed a little bit of everything,
you know, just in case...

746
00:44:39.187 --> 00:44:40.223
Uh, what's a gamallus?

747
00:44:40.264 --> 00:44:41.784
It's like a pachymollet,
only much bigger.

748
00:44:41.813 --> 00:44:44.337
- And what does a pachymollet look like?
- Like that!

749
00:44:46.536 --> 00:44:49.139
Any chance you got something in
your bag for dealing with pachymollets?

750
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.383
Don't worry! I've got
my 300 function pocket knife here.

751
00:44:51.417 --> 00:44:53.743
Double knife, multicrab clips,
soap bubbles, music box,

752
00:44:53.789 --> 00:44:55.511
and for when things
get really hot, a fan.

753
00:44:55.536 --> 00:44:57.199
Hey, that's pretty handy alright!

754
00:44:57.234 --> 00:44:58.879
And then you've got
all your classic functions

755
00:44:58.912 --> 00:45:01.741
like your tulipan, matchet,
sunjink, whistler, gullybar...

756
00:45:01.768 --> 00:45:03.721
Nothing in there to cut off
tongue by any chance?

757
00:45:03.757 --> 00:45:05.725
No, but that's you specialty, isn't it?

758
00:45:06.744 --> 00:45:08.360
Stay right where you are!!

759
00:45:09.998 --> 00:45:11.987
- Run. On my signal.
- Mmm-hhh.

760
00:45:14.157 --> 00:45:15.428
Now!

761
00:45:20.725 --> 00:45:22.098
Here we are.

762
00:45:29.276 --> 00:45:30.351
Anybody home?

763
00:45:30.384 --> 00:45:32.097
Not many people come through this way.

764
00:45:32.122 --> 00:45:34.158
Once you've tried it,
you'll understand why!

765
00:45:34.723 --> 00:45:36.066
Anybody home?

766
00:45:36.893 --> 00:45:38.553
Oh, oh, no!
I'm sorry!

767
00:45:38.599 --> 00:45:40.033
I... I mistook you for a bell.

768
00:45:40.059 --> 00:45:43.499
Um, no, I mean, I didn't realize
you were actually... alive!

769
00:45:43.532 --> 00:45:45.495
Eh, hold on.
Ma que fa, stupido!

770
00:45:45.535 --> 00:45:48.281
What do you think you're doing
knocking out all of my customers like that?

771
00:45:48.321 --> 00:45:50.137
It's not as if I have
so many to start with.

772
00:45:50.162 --> 00:45:51.547
Hello.
I am Princess Selenia.

773
00:45:51.575 --> 00:45:53.861
I know that and
that is your stupido brother.

774
00:45:53.909 --> 00:45:55.138
And who's the third comedian

775
00:45:55.178 --> 00:45:57.058
who comes around
knocking out all the customers?

776
00:45:57.083 --> 00:45:58.093
My name's Arthur!

777
00:45:58.118 --> 00:45:59.705
- And I'm looking for my grandfather!
- Ahhh...

778
00:45:59.745 --> 00:46:01.982
I transported your grandfather
a few years ago.

779
00:46:02.064 --> 00:46:03.467
An old eccentric madman

780
00:46:03.507 --> 00:46:05.880
who absolutely insisted
on being transported

781
00:46:05.907 --> 00:46:09.294
deep inside Seides territory,
to the Necropolis.

782
00:46:09.387 --> 00:46:11.035
That's him.
That's my grandfather.

783
00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.660
And that's exactly where we wanna go!

784
00:46:12.704 --> 00:46:14.454
- Sold out.
- Ah!

785
00:46:14.534 --> 00:46:17.469
Necropolis, sure,
why not the moon as well...

786
00:46:23.123 --> 00:46:24.443
We didn't ask you for the moon.

787
00:46:24.473 --> 00:46:26.557
We asked for three tickets to Necropolis.

788
00:46:26.591 --> 00:46:28.310
Is that clear enough?

789
00:46:36.299 --> 00:46:38.301
Arthur!

790
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:41.758
Arthur?

791
00:46:41.818 --> 00:46:44.451
You break my door to steal the key?

792
00:46:44.671 --> 00:46:46.834
Answer me Arthur!
Aahh!!!

793
00:46:46.888 --> 00:46:48.580
Alfred!

794
00:46:54.351 --> 00:46:56.981
Oh! What a job!
Right this way.

795
00:46:57.067 --> 00:46:59.240
Come on, keep it moving
while we're young.

796
00:46:59.272 --> 00:47:02.332
Yes, that's a leaf.
Let's go, dandelion.

797
00:47:04.362 --> 00:47:07.682
Hey, that ain't for decoration.
You're gonna need it.

798
00:47:08.537 --> 00:47:10.095
Arrivederci, baby.

799
00:47:10.966 --> 00:47:12.346
Arthur.

800
00:47:13.237 --> 00:47:16.133
Arthur!!!

801
00:47:18.538 --> 00:47:19.711
The car?

802
00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:22.351
What's the car doing there?

803
00:47:22.792 --> 00:47:24.231
Necropolis, ohh.

804
00:47:24.289 --> 00:47:26.218
Oh, boy!
Here we go.

805
00:47:27.956 --> 00:47:29.356
Ah, here it is!

806
00:47:32.403 --> 00:47:34.255
Oh, wow!
That's cool.

807
00:47:34.369 --> 00:47:36.481
I got another one just like it in pink.
Wanna see it?

808
00:47:36.522 --> 00:47:38.421
Beta, we've got enough light already.

809
00:47:40.468 --> 00:47:41.468
Arthur?

810
00:47:41.702 --> 00:47:43.377
Uh, where exactly are we heading?

811
00:47:43.435 --> 00:47:45.024
We are here and we're going here!

812
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:46.632
Oh my gosh!
I know where that is.

813
00:47:46.665 --> 00:47:48.919
- That's right under the water tank.
- Giant water tank.

814
00:47:48.945 --> 00:47:50.904
In the hands of
that unspeakable piece of...

815
00:47:50.945 --> 00:47:53.085
- Now I'm starting to understand.
- Who are you talking about?

816
00:47:53.119 --> 00:47:54.769
The most evil of evil.

817
00:47:54.813 --> 00:47:56.669
Oh! Malthazar.

818
00:48:01.967 --> 00:48:03.180
Holy humpbacked gamallus!

819
00:48:03.205 --> 00:48:05.087
Didn't anyone ever teach you
to hold your tongue?

820
00:48:05.112 --> 00:48:06.506
I... I'm really sorry.

821
00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.093
Arthur?!

822
00:48:09.126 --> 00:48:10.519
Granny?

823
00:48:11.996 --> 00:48:14.003
And... we're off.

824
00:48:18.315 --> 00:48:19.749
Arthur?

825
00:48:21.199 --> 00:48:22.589
How long is the flight?

826
00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:25.487
It's pretty short, as long as we can
avoid any unpleasant encounters.

827
00:48:25.542 --> 00:48:28.458
What do you mean by
unpleasant encounters?

828
00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:48.835
Holy bumblebee smashed the door in
and now we're stuck.

829
00:48:50.783 --> 00:48:51.864
Whoa!

830
00:48:51.897 --> 00:48:53.297
- What is that?
- I have no idea.

831
00:48:53.323 --> 00:48:55.157
But I don't think we should
hang around to find out!

832
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:57.657
- Wh... What are you doing?
- I'm getting out of here.

833
00:48:59.051 --> 00:49:00.196
Oops.

834
00:49:01.283 --> 00:49:02.529
Hold on tight.

835
00:49:06.286 --> 00:49:08.192
- Whooaa!!!
- Whoa!

836
00:49:08.226 --> 00:49:10.506
- I like it much better when it stops.
- Oh gosh!

837
00:49:10.531 --> 00:49:12.032
Somebody's gonna get hurt with this.

838
00:49:12.061 --> 00:49:14.432
I'll hang onto it.
It'll be safer that way.

839
00:49:17.339 --> 00:49:18.973
The water!

840
00:49:19.146 --> 00:49:20.366
Do something, Arthur!

841
00:49:20.406 --> 00:49:21.534
Get us out of this!

842
00:49:21.574 --> 00:49:23.927
It looks like you two are gonna
have to get me out of this.

843
00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:25.254
There's a hole in my boat!

844
00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:27.593
Minimoys can't swim!

845
00:49:27.962 --> 00:49:29.882
- I'm coming to get you.
- Arthur!

846
00:49:30.329 --> 00:49:32.265
Arthur, please!

847
00:49:32.298 --> 00:49:33.852
I'm coming, I'm coming.

848
00:49:34.262 --> 00:49:35.318
I know this river.

849
00:49:35.362 --> 00:49:36.978
First there's a bend to the right,

850
00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:38.878
then, there's a sharp bend to the left.

851
00:49:41.094 --> 00:49:42.407
So to catch up with them,

852
00:49:42.447 --> 00:49:44.734
all I have to do is cut straight
across as the crow flies.

853
00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:48.021
Sorry, but as the crow flies is
as the crow flies.

854
00:49:55.623 --> 00:49:58.086
- Now you see, I didn't abandon you.
- Oh, great!

855
00:49:58.132 --> 00:50:00.966
So instead of the two of us drowning,
now all three of us can drown together.

856
00:50:00.999 --> 00:50:02.227
No one's gonna drown, Selenia.

857
00:50:02.252 --> 00:50:04.274
Surely you're not gonna let
a little river frighten you, are you?

858
00:50:04.314 --> 00:50:05.807
It's not the river I'm frightened of.

859
00:50:05.859 --> 00:50:07.307
It's that!

860
00:50:09.295 --> 00:50:12.229
So, Mr. "I'm here",
got any good ideas before we drown?

861
00:50:12.262 --> 00:50:13.575
Sure, of course I have.

862
00:50:13.626 --> 00:50:16.602
Beta, any chance there's a rope on that
300 function pocket knife of yours?

863
00:50:16.639 --> 00:50:19.203
Euh, no.
That's only on the smaller model.

864
00:50:20.716 --> 00:50:22.209
I've got an idea.

865
00:50:22.665 --> 00:50:23.668
- Hey!
- Ow!

866
00:50:23.715 --> 00:50:26.115
Just because we're gonna die, it doesn't
mean you can start taking liberties.

867
00:50:26.148 --> 00:50:27.221
No, you've got it all wrong.

868
00:50:27.255 --> 00:50:29.328
I, I need the lace
to reach that tree over there.

869
00:50:29.361 --> 00:50:31.246
I'm not so sure about this idea of yours.

870
00:50:31.271 --> 00:50:32.841
- Well, I'm sure.
- Whooaahh!

871
00:50:32.866 --> 00:50:34.823
Arthur, have you ever thrown
a sword like that before?

872
00:50:34.849 --> 00:50:37.640
No, but it can't be much
more difficult than playing darts.

873
00:50:40.084 --> 00:50:41.304
Betameche you go first!

874
00:50:41.344 --> 00:50:43.084
- Selenia, you next!
- Yes, sir!

875
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.773
Your turn Selenia.

876
00:50:45.524 --> 00:50:46.983
Betameche, hurry up!!

877
00:50:47.029 --> 00:50:48.883
I can't, I'm sliping.

878
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:51.219
Selenia, hold on with both hands!

879
00:50:51.252 --> 00:50:53.479
Absolutely no way!!

880
00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:02.421
- We're safe.
- Not quite. Aah!!

881
00:51:05.989 --> 00:51:08.351
Come on, Arthur, hurry up.
We haven't got all day.

882
00:51:08.388 --> 00:51:09.751
I'm coming.

883
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:13.778
Selenia, you gotta admit it.
The guy is pretty agile.

884
00:51:13.818 --> 00:51:16.287
Huh! It's easy when
you've got both hands free

885
00:51:19.531 --> 00:51:20.698
Thanks.

886
00:51:20.805 --> 00:51:22.951
Arthur, you were fantastic!

887
00:51:22.987 --> 00:51:26.047
Right, maybe Mr. Fantastic
can return my lace now.

888
00:51:27.411 --> 00:51:29.898
It's already so hard without my husband.

889
00:51:29.954 --> 00:51:32.218
I don't know how
I'll survive without Arthur.

890
00:51:32.243 --> 00:51:33.891
I'm sure he's just run away for a spell.

891
00:51:33.921 --> 00:51:35.525
All of these events
have probably upset him.

892
00:51:35.554 --> 00:51:37.210
- Yes.
- I don't think he could have gotten far,

893
00:51:37.244 --> 00:51:39.510
and we're gonna do everything
we can to find him, ma'am.

894
00:51:39.537 --> 00:51:41.573
- Okay.
- You can count on us.

895
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.793
What was that?

896
00:52:02.833 --> 00:52:04.020
- Humans.
- Really?

897
00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.223
Yep. Sometimes it's like that
all day long.

898
00:52:06.262 --> 00:52:08.115
Oh, rats.
This map's a total washout.

899
00:52:08.142 --> 00:52:09.438
How are we ever gonna
find our way now?

900
00:52:09.465 --> 00:52:11.498
We'll use the position of the sun
to guide us when it comes up.

901
00:52:11.525 --> 00:52:13.242
In the meantime,
let's look for a place to sleep.

902
00:52:13.288 --> 00:52:14.841
And make sure you find us
something comfy, Selenia,

903
00:52:14.874 --> 00:52:16.061
'cause I ache all over.

904
00:52:16.094 --> 00:52:19.148
Beta, if you complain once more,
you can go sleep under a bullmunch.

905
00:52:19.198 --> 00:52:20.472
What's a bullmunch?

906
00:52:20.523 --> 00:52:22.910
It's like a gamallus,
only much, much bigger.

907
00:52:26.192 --> 00:52:27.586
Beta, I'm gonna need your knife.

908
00:52:27.626 --> 00:52:28.839
Coming right up!

909
00:52:29.049 --> 00:52:30.665
Where did they put the METAGLUE?

910
00:52:30.719 --> 00:52:32.025
Wah!! Aah!
Whoops!

911
00:52:32.059 --> 00:52:33.312
- Ah!
- Sorry!

912
00:52:33.565 --> 00:52:35.973
Give that to me, Beta, before
you end up hurting somebody.

913
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.665
Just hang on.
I haven't had it very long.

914
00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:39.163
- I just got it for my birthday.
- How old are you?

915
00:52:39.203 --> 00:52:40.256
I'm 300 years old.

916
00:52:40.281 --> 00:52:42.463
Only another sixty years,
I will be a grown-up.

917
00:52:42.503 --> 00:52:44.952
- How old's Selenia then?
- Almost a thousand years old.

918
00:52:44.979 --> 00:52:46.026
A thousand years old?

919
00:52:46.059 --> 00:52:47.677
Oh, yes.
The age of reason.

920
00:52:47.732 --> 00:52:49.412
It's her birthday in two days.

921
00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:50.979
How is this working?

922
00:52:51.284 --> 00:52:52.647
Got it!

923
00:52:58.126 --> 00:52:59.502
- Whoa!
- Oh!

924
00:52:59.561 --> 00:53:00.716
Come on.

925
00:53:04.959 --> 00:53:07.144
Ow! Ah!
What's she up to?

926
00:53:07.206 --> 00:53:08.552
She's making the bed.

927
00:53:08.626 --> 00:53:11.026
Ah!
I'm exhausted.

928
00:53:11.752 --> 00:53:13.125
Goodnight!

929
00:53:14.245 --> 00:53:16.879
Well, he certainly doesn't have
any trouble sleeping, does he?

930
00:53:16.919 --> 00:53:19.609
- It's normal. He's still young.
- Three hundred years young.

931
00:53:19.664 --> 00:53:21.084
It's not bad!

932
00:53:22.383 --> 00:53:24.463
Whooaah! Whooaa.

933
00:53:24.889 --> 00:53:26.216
Ah!

934
00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:28.023
So good.

935
00:53:30.479 --> 00:53:31.692
What about you?

936
00:53:31.752 --> 00:53:34.206
Are you really gonna be
a thousand years old in two days?

937
00:53:34.239 --> 00:53:35.306
Aaah, yes.

938
00:53:35.339 --> 00:53:37.839
And in two days time,
I am to succeed my father.

939
00:53:37.878 --> 00:53:40.782
And watch over the Minimoy people
until it shall come to pass

940
00:53:40.788 --> 00:53:44.811
that my own children reach the age
of one thousand and succeed me.

941
00:53:45.018 --> 00:53:46.604
Such is the tradition!

942
00:53:46.766 --> 00:53:49.543
But to have children,
you need a... husband.

943
00:53:49.599 --> 00:53:51.226
I know.
But I'm not worried.

944
00:53:51.273 --> 00:53:52.940
I still have two whole days
to find one.

945
00:53:52.987 --> 00:53:54.093
And now...

946
00:53:54.813 --> 00:53:56.143
Goodnight...

947
00:53:57.403 --> 00:53:58.734
Arthur!

948
00:53:59.133 --> 00:54:02.150
Goodnight, Princess.

949
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.278
Arthur?!

950
00:54:39.516 --> 00:54:41.022
Hmmm.

951
00:54:43.189 --> 00:54:44.550
Oh!

952
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:49.616
Come on, time to get up boys.

953
00:54:49.669 --> 00:54:51.796
We've got a long journey
ahead of us today.

954
00:54:58.317 --> 00:55:00.267
Hello, I said: Get up.

955
00:55:01.754 --> 00:55:03.847
Okay, this calls for
a change of tactic.

956
00:55:04.597 --> 00:55:06.104
- Ow!
- Ow!

957
00:55:06.663 --> 00:55:08.517
Come on now, shower time.

958
00:55:09.607 --> 00:55:12.287
- That's what I call a rude awakening.
- Consider yourself lucky.

959
00:55:12.334 --> 00:55:15.494
She's been waking me up like that
every morning for the last 300 years.

960
00:55:31.185 --> 00:55:33.234
Mmm, these are even better
than the other ones.

961
00:55:33.285 --> 00:55:34.607
Here, try some.

962
00:55:35.148 --> 00:55:37.188
Hmm, tastes good.
What is it exactly?

963
00:55:37.251 --> 00:55:38.708
Dragonfly eggs.

964
00:55:39.651 --> 00:55:41.654
Hey, come and take a look at this.

965
00:55:42.884 --> 00:55:44.875
Oh!
Wow!

966
00:55:44.934 --> 00:55:46.447
That's awful!!

967
00:55:46.934 --> 00:55:50.727
I suppose, euh, seen from this angle,
it is less attractive.

968
00:55:51.222 --> 00:55:53.608
Anybody have an idea
what this thing is for?

969
00:55:53.748 --> 00:55:55.383
It's an irrigation system.

970
00:55:55.408 --> 00:55:56.477
It transports water.

971
00:55:56.515 --> 00:55:57.598
Water?
More water?

972
00:55:57.631 --> 00:55:59.711
I'm really sorry,
I had absolutely no idea that...

973
00:55:59.745 --> 00:56:00.958
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

974
00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:03.234
You mean that you're the one
who built this monstrosity?

975
00:56:03.259 --> 00:56:05.455
Yes, but I, I only wanted
to water the radishes.

976
00:56:05.499 --> 00:56:06.596
- Granny loves radishes.
- What?

977
00:56:06.622 --> 00:56:08.702
You mean, you actually eat
those disgusting things?

978
00:56:08.749 --> 00:56:12.139
Let's just hope your invention
doesn't fall into the hands of the Evil M.

979
00:56:12.211 --> 00:56:15.219
Otherwise, I have a pretty good idea
of what he'll do with it.

980
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.546
Timber!

981
00:56:23.806 --> 00:56:25.011
Watch out!

982
00:56:25.106 --> 00:56:27.013
My straws.
They're stealing my straws.

983
00:56:27.038 --> 00:56:28.659
As long as they're
getting rid of those things,

984
00:56:28.706 --> 00:56:31.666
- I'd say they're doing us a favour.
- Try thinking before you talk, Betameche!

985
00:56:31.692 --> 00:56:34.809
The Evil M. Knows only too well
that the Minimoys can't stand water.

986
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:36.102
And your friend, Arthur here,

987
00:56:36.135 --> 00:56:38.435
just provided him
with the means to transport water.

988
00:56:38.482 --> 00:56:41.138
- Where do you suppose he'll send it to?
- Oh! Our village!

989
00:56:42.785 --> 00:56:44.278
Arthur, where are you going?

990
00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:46.298
To repair the damage I've done.

991
00:56:46.885 --> 00:56:49.281
I can't believe that guy.
Humans are really crazy.

992
00:56:49.334 --> 00:56:51.568
That may be.
But I think Arthur's right.

993
00:56:51.595 --> 00:56:54.662
They're bound to take the straws
to Necropolis and us along with them.

994
00:56:54.705 --> 00:56:56.764
I never get to decide anything.

995
00:56:57.623 --> 00:56:59.310
It's really nice of you to come with me.

996
00:56:59.337 --> 00:57:02.417
I'm just worried you're gonna do
something stupid if I'm not around.

997
00:57:06.027 --> 00:57:08.448
Pssst!
Beta, hurry up!

998
00:57:11.574 --> 00:57:14.193
Ah! Whooaa!! Aahh!!

999
00:57:17.113 --> 00:57:18.503
Here we go again.

1000
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.970
Do you know at least
where this waterway leads to?

1001
00:57:22.017 --> 00:57:25.563
No. But in any case, all rivers
and waterways meet up at some point.

1002
00:57:27.121 --> 00:57:29.515
Ah, you always have such
brilliant ideas, don't you?!

1003
00:57:29.555 --> 00:57:31.881
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
Give me back your lace.

1004
00:57:31.932 --> 00:57:33.957
Absolutely no way.

1005
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.615
Hold on tight.

1006
00:57:42.335 --> 00:57:43.942
Uh! Ah!

1007
00:57:45.861 --> 00:57:48.112
Oh! I hate public transportation!

1008
00:58:02.257 --> 00:58:03.837
Hey-ho!

1009
00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:07.423
Hey, man, what are you
playin' at down there?

1010
00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:10.216
Uh, if the Seides find us first,
we won't have a chance to tell you.

1011
00:58:10.241 --> 00:58:11.676
The seides?

1012
00:58:13.573 --> 00:58:15.329
- You got a problem?
- No, it's nothing.

1013
00:58:15.356 --> 00:58:17.389
I was just checking that
the accordion part ain't damaged.

1014
00:58:17.416 --> 00:58:19.596
We don't need that part.
We're only want the stems.

1015
00:58:19.621 --> 00:58:21.068
Oh, yeah, the stems.
Sure thing.

1016
00:58:21.095 --> 00:58:22.563
Get a move on,
the master is waiting.

1017
00:58:22.588 --> 00:58:24.282
Oh, yeah, the master.
Sure thing.

1018
00:58:24.328 --> 00:58:25.829
No problemo.

1019
00:58:29.379 --> 00:58:31.765
Whatever you do, don't move
until I come back and get you. Got it?

1020
00:58:31.807 --> 00:58:33.304
- No problemo.
- No problemo.

1021
00:58:34.453 --> 00:58:35.987
So where are these refugees of yours?

1022
00:58:36.021 --> 00:58:39.218
I've hidden them in a mega discreet place.

1023
00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:47.973
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yup, and mega discreet like you said.

1024
00:58:49.154 --> 00:58:50.620
Jackfire all 'round!

1025
00:58:50.655 --> 00:58:52.351
- Uh, yes, please.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1026
00:58:52.404 --> 00:58:53.671
Uh, sure, thanks.

1027
00:58:53.705 --> 00:58:55.938
Hey, Jack, fill 'em up.
This one is on me.

1028
00:58:58.328 --> 00:59:00.068
Heh, heh, heh.
Yes!

1029
00:59:03.768 --> 00:59:05.608
Long live the Seven Kingdoms!

1030
00:59:05.648 --> 00:59:07.462
Long live the Seven Kingdoms!

1031
00:59:09.228 --> 00:59:10.456
Yeah.

1032
00:59:11.821 --> 00:59:13.704
Aah!
Just what I needed.

1033
00:59:13.741 --> 00:59:15.557
Oh, yep.
That hits the spot.

1034
00:59:15.591 --> 00:59:18.757
Ooh!
It's the best jackfire in town baby.

1035
00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:22.952
Oh, euh, sorry.
Euh, to the Seven Kingdoms!

1036
00:59:28.988 --> 00:59:30.152
That's refreshing stuff!

1037
00:59:30.189 --> 00:59:32.632
As long as you here with me,
there's really nothing to fear.

1038
00:59:32.659 --> 00:59:34.752
I'm the boss here.
My name is Max.

1039
00:59:34.777 --> 00:59:35.795
Hiya Max!

1040
00:59:35.828 --> 00:59:37.608
And you, young lady.
Who might you be?

1041
00:59:37.642 --> 00:59:39.925
Selenia, daughter of
Emperor Sifrat of Matradoy,

1042
00:59:39.938 --> 00:59:42.497
the fifteenth of that name,
Governor of the First Kingdom.

1043
00:59:42.522 --> 00:59:43.837
Wow!

1044
00:59:44.875 --> 00:59:46.421
Delighted to meet you, baby.

1045
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:48.295
Jack, same again.

1046
00:59:50.559 --> 00:59:52.379
Hey, yo Easylow!

1047
00:59:52.459 --> 00:59:53.679
Wheuh?
Yes, boss?

1048
00:59:53.722 --> 00:59:55.613
Let's get this show on the road.

1049
00:59:55.669 --> 00:59:57.019
You got it.

1050
01:00:00.223 --> 01:00:02.576
May I have the honor of
this dance, Princess?

1051
01:00:02.622 --> 01:00:04.176
Selenia? We ought to be making a move,

1052
01:00:04.202 --> 01:00:05.462
we've still got a long way to go!

1053
01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.831
Certainly.

1054
01:00:15.681 --> 01:00:17.135
She's too old for me anyway.

1055
01:00:17.168 --> 01:00:18.635
She's a thousand.
I'm only ten.

1056
01:00:18.675 --> 01:00:20.788
What would I want with an older woman?

1057
01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:27.948
What's a good looking kid like you
doing in front of an empty glass?

1058
01:00:28.395 --> 01:00:31.017
Well if it wasn't empty,
you couldn't fill it up, could you?

1059
01:00:31.471 --> 01:00:32.984
I like your sense of humour, kid.

1060
01:00:33.016 --> 01:00:36.119
I can tell we're gonna
get along just fine. Jack!

1061
01:00:37.657 --> 01:00:38.920
Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.

1062
01:00:38.953 --> 01:00:41.953
If you want to find a husband in two days,
then there's no time to lose.

1063
01:00:41.993 --> 01:00:44.646
- But I can help you out if you like.
- Oh, that's sweet of you, thanks.

1064
01:00:44.673 --> 01:00:45.688
I like to help out.

1065
01:00:45.721 --> 01:00:47.721
Besides, which things are
pretty tame right now.

1066
01:00:47.747 --> 01:00:48.898
I only have seven wives.

1067
01:00:48.938 --> 01:00:50.551
Wow! Seven wives?
That uh...

1068
01:00:50.594 --> 01:00:52.209
Ahuh...
That must take a lot out of you.

1069
01:00:52.238 --> 01:00:53.268
I like hard work.

1070
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:55.184
I can work night and day.

1071
01:00:55.237 --> 01:00:58.200
Seven days a week,
and I never get tired.

1072
01:00:58.226 --> 01:01:00.060
HAh, hah, hah.
Wonderful!

1073
01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:03.087
So, where do I sign?

1074
01:01:03.141 --> 01:01:06.267
Anywhere you like, kid.
It doesn't make any difference.

1075
01:01:09.872 --> 01:01:11.300
- Oh, Selenia!
- Um...

1076
01:01:11.332 --> 01:01:12.573
Excuse me, but, uh...

1077
01:01:12.623 --> 01:01:14.407
He's already signed up elsewhere.

1078
01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:17.853
Selenia, it's...

1079
01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.993
Are you really gonna be
a thousand years old?

1080
01:01:20.039 --> 01:01:22.233
Yeah, if you count the years
in Selenielle blossoms.

1081
01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:23.559
Selenielle's the royal flower.

1082
01:01:23.599 --> 01:01:25.920
Ahh!
Okay, in Selenielles.

1083
01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.733
- So, how old does that make me?
- About the same age as me.

1084
01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.548
Wow!
That's amazing.

1085
01:01:30.588 --> 01:01:33.178
And uh... So before,
were you a little girl like me?

1086
01:01:33.225 --> 01:01:35.778
- What?
- No, I... I mean, I'm a boy, of course.

1087
01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:38.167
But, were you a little girl
like the other little girls

1088
01:01:38.214 --> 01:01:40.501
- in my neighborhood?
- No, I was born as I am.

1089
01:01:40.607 --> 01:01:43.157
And I've never set foot
outside the Seven Kingdoms.

1090
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:45.603
I'd really like to take you
to my world one day.

1091
01:01:52.814 --> 01:01:54.028
That's Malthazar?

1092
01:01:54.074 --> 01:01:56.886
No, lucky for you.
It's only Darkos, his son.

1093
01:01:58.643 --> 01:01:59.716
Eh, hey!

1094
01:01:59.756 --> 01:02:02.109
Darkos, this is an honour.

1095
01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:03.789
Nah.

1096
01:02:04.546 --> 01:02:07.781
Great timing. There's quite a vibe
going down here this evening.

1097
01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:08.848
I can see that.

1098
01:02:08.881 --> 01:02:12.603
Organizing parties without
inviting our friends now, are we?

1099
01:02:12.658 --> 01:02:14.450
No way.
It wasn't planned.

1100
01:02:14.492 --> 01:02:16.130
Just a little something we improvised.

1101
01:02:16.157 --> 01:02:17.957
To impress the new punters, you know?

1102
01:02:17.992 --> 01:02:19.590
New faces?

1103
01:02:21.152 --> 01:02:22.895
Warm me if he comes this way.

1104
01:02:24.715 --> 01:02:26.742
Hey, Darkos, what's up?

1105
01:02:26.768 --> 01:02:27.903
Selenia.

1106
01:02:27.928 --> 01:02:30.808
What's a princess of your rank
doing in a place like this?

1107
01:02:30.835 --> 01:02:32.282
I just dropped in for a dance.

1108
01:02:32.322 --> 01:02:35.456
Ah!
Well then, let's dance.

1109
01:02:35.491 --> 01:02:36.516
Darkos, sweetheart.

1110
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:38.984
I would rather die than dance with you!

1111
01:02:39.009 --> 01:02:40.992
Your wish is my command, Princess.

1112
01:02:41.025 --> 01:02:43.679
You will dance for all eternity!

1113
01:02:44.058 --> 01:02:46.425
- Easylow, get this place rocking.
- Yes.

1114
01:02:46.626 --> 01:02:48.031
Get them!

1115
01:02:53.027 --> 01:02:54.280
Yeah.

1116
01:03:01.728 --> 01:03:03.281
Arthur! Look out!

1117
01:03:05.688 --> 01:03:07.921
Hey, they're putting up a good fight.

1118
01:03:07.961 --> 01:03:10.607
Let's see if they've got the groove.

1119
01:03:30.726 --> 01:03:33.903
Staying alive.
Huh-huh-huh-huh...

1120
01:03:33.929 --> 01:03:36.696
I think I'll go get some reinforcements.

1121
01:03:37.737 --> 01:03:38.783
Yeah!

1122
01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.590
- I like this kid.
- Mmm-hhh.

1123
01:03:40.627 --> 01:03:43.577
Oh! Three against one, huh?
Then I'll just triple the power.

1124
01:03:44.239 --> 01:03:46.079
Oh! How sweet!
So... You shouldn't have.

1125
01:03:46.112 --> 01:03:47.706
Oh, really.
It was nothing.

1126
01:03:50.718 --> 01:03:53.298
Woooh!
That's my girl.

1127
01:03:58.798 --> 01:04:00.558
- Ha!
- Holy gullybars, you scared me!

1128
01:04:00.585 --> 01:04:01.625
What are you doing here?

1129
01:04:01.665 --> 01:04:04.225
I lost my knife.
I gotta find something else.

1130
01:04:05.444 --> 01:04:07.471
- You find anything??
- Ahhh! Naa!

1131
01:04:15.197 --> 01:04:16.424
My knife!

1132
01:04:17.827 --> 01:04:19.358
Wooh!

1133
01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:22.144
That's entertainment.

1134
01:04:22.706 --> 01:04:23.859
Wha...Aah!!

1135
01:04:28.802 --> 01:04:31.036
Easylow, closing time, I think.

1136
01:04:33.621 --> 01:04:35.696
- Charge.
- Charge, my butt.

1137
01:04:38.622 --> 01:04:39.749
- Aahh!
- Got them!

1138
01:04:39.776 --> 01:04:41.542
- There they are.
- I've got, I've got them.

1139
01:04:41.729 --> 01:04:43.633
- Ow! One of them bit me.
- Sorry, boss.

1140
01:04:43.674 --> 01:04:45.406
Somebody, turn the lights on!

1141
01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:51.661
What's going on?

1142
01:04:51.694 --> 01:04:53.774
I'm just following your orders, my Lord.

1143
01:04:53.808 --> 01:04:56.436
Ten o'clock curfew.
And it's ten o'clock.

1144
01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:01.447
Late opening authorization granted!!!

1145
01:05:01.508 --> 01:05:04.247
Cool, real cool!

1146
01:05:04.663 --> 01:05:06.283
Come on, man, follow me.

1147
01:05:09.376 --> 01:05:11.536
Look, if you go this way,
you'll travel safe.

1148
01:05:12.201 --> 01:05:13.674
Oh, great!!

1149
01:05:13.714 --> 01:05:14.787
This is from Max.

1150
01:05:14.821 --> 01:05:17.614
It will lead you right to M's quarters.

1151
01:05:21.964 --> 01:05:25.104
Ooohhh, I'm sure glad
me ain't going along.

1152
01:05:28.894 --> 01:05:30.474
Get out.
Move aside.

1153
01:05:31.914 --> 01:05:37.390
I... want... them!!!!!

1154
01:05:37.997 --> 01:05:39.496
What was that unearthly scream?

1155
01:05:39.529 --> 01:05:41.925
Oh, just Darkos throwing
a little temper tantrum.

1156
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:43.605
Do you think Max will be able
to delay him for long?

1157
01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:46.225
Max is a real smooth talker.
I think we can count on him.

1158
01:05:46.272 --> 01:05:47.287
Come on, let's go.

1159
01:05:47.327 --> 01:05:50.003
Yeah, yeah, right. How can you even
think about trusting a guy like...?

1160
01:05:50.028 --> 01:05:51.230
- Hey, wait.
- Don't start Betameche.

1161
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:54.363
- Oh, wait.
- Just keep walking and shut up, please.

1162
01:05:54.393 --> 01:05:56.656
- Wh-what's that growling noise?
- What growling noise?

1163
01:05:56.683 --> 01:05:58.409
- I don't hear anything.
- Cut it out, Selenia.

1164
01:05:58.436 --> 01:06:00.308
I know you're just saying that
to give me the creeps.

1165
01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:02.020
- Come on, what was it?
- It's the Yeti.

1166
01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.640
He's growling because
you woke him up.

1167
01:06:03.696 --> 01:06:05.932
And now, he's gonna eat you.
Now what do you say?

1168
01:06:05.979 --> 01:06:07.726
The Yeti? Really?

1169
01:06:20.461 --> 01:06:22.981
- Aaaahhhh!!!
- Surprise!!

1170
01:06:23.288 --> 01:06:26.535
Yeah, well, this is... a surprise.

1171
01:06:26.621 --> 01:06:27.877
Where's Arthur?

1172
01:06:27.937 --> 01:06:31.377
He's up... in...
In the garden.

1173
01:06:31.564 --> 01:06:33.330
In the, in the... in the garden?

1174
01:06:34.635 --> 01:06:37.035
- Hhh! This is it.
- Thank you, Betameche.

1175
01:06:37.075 --> 01:06:38.775
Without you, we'd be completely lost.

1176
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:41.198
- Give me your knife.
- Okay, but don't break it.

1177
01:06:44.463 --> 01:06:45.952
Oh, come on, boys, let's go.

1178
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:48.246
- After you, Selenia.
- Princesses first.

1179
01:06:48.286 --> 01:06:51.186
Men only act like gentlemen
when it suits them, huh?

1180
01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:56.860
Well, uh...
Princes second.

1181
01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.774
Guess it's my turn.

1182
01:07:11.896 --> 01:07:14.069
Aaaahhhh!!! Ah!

1183
01:07:14.116 --> 01:07:15.789
What do you mean he disappeared?

1184
01:07:15.843 --> 01:07:20.799
Every night I, I told him stories about
his Grandpa's adventures in Africa.

1185
01:07:20.886 --> 01:07:24.005
And last night, I, I told him
about the Minimoys.

1186
01:07:24.032 --> 01:07:25.405
The Min, Mini what? What?

1187
01:07:25.432 --> 01:07:26.547
The Minimoys!

1188
01:07:26.574 --> 01:07:30.217
And, um, he became convinced
that they live in our garden.

1189
01:07:30.242 --> 01:07:31.272
In the garden?

1190
01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:33.391
These are just fairy tales
and legends, Granny.

1191
01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:35.085
Of course, but then,

1192
01:07:35.127 --> 01:07:37.987
since I made the mistake
of, of letting him know

1193
01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.940
about our money problems,

1194
01:07:40.337 --> 01:07:44.220
he got it into his head to find
the treasure that grandpa hid.

1195
01:07:45.524 --> 01:07:46.947
- What treasure?
- What treasure?

1196
01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:50.335
Honey,

1197
01:07:50.431 --> 01:07:54.215
what's the use of finding the treasure
if Arthur isn't here to enjoy it?

1198
01:07:54.248 --> 01:07:55.336
Don't worry, Granny.

1199
01:07:55.361 --> 01:07:57.224
I'm sure Arthur will be right back.

1200
01:07:57.265 --> 01:07:59.859
He... He just took
a little time off, that's all.

1201
01:08:00.224 --> 01:08:01.870
- No, in the hole.
- Sorry.

1202
01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:03.310
Not the face.

1203
01:08:04.426 --> 01:08:05.433
Hurry!

1204
01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:06.986
Aaahhh!!! Oh!

1205
01:08:07.373 --> 01:08:08.820
Oh.

1206
01:08:12.633 --> 01:08:15.473
- Shhh.
- Selenia, it's crawling with Seides.

1207
01:08:15.518 --> 01:08:17.780
Duh...
What do you think we're hiding for?

1208
01:08:21.885 --> 01:08:22.933
What are they doing?

1209
01:08:22.958 --> 01:08:24.638
They must be taking food to their Master.

1210
01:08:24.671 --> 01:08:25.925
Let's follow them.

1211
01:08:31.784 --> 01:08:33.759
- Do you think he's there?
- Yep!

1212
01:08:33.784 --> 01:08:35.624
Wh-wh-what are we gonna do, Selenia?

1213
01:08:35.657 --> 01:08:37.857
I'm gonna spoil his lunch.

1214
01:08:38.312 --> 01:08:40.319
Oh, oh!
He's not gonna like that.

1215
01:08:42.193 --> 01:08:44.631
- But Se...
- This is where our paths separate, Arthur.

1216
01:08:44.656 --> 01:08:45.904
I have to deal with this alone.

1217
01:08:45.929 --> 01:08:47.541
What do you mean?
I thought we were a team.

1218
01:08:47.575 --> 01:08:49.179
Well, the team is about to split up.

1219
01:08:49.204 --> 01:08:52.243
You're gonna go look for your treasure,
and I'm gonna take care of M.

1220
01:08:52.297 --> 01:08:54.323
If I succeed,
we'll meet back here.

1221
01:08:54.357 --> 01:08:55.643
And if you fail?

1222
01:08:56.153 --> 01:08:57.325
If I should fail...

1223
01:08:57.393 --> 01:08:59.992
I bequeath all my powers to you.

1224
01:09:00.067 --> 01:09:01.493
What do you mean?

1225
01:09:06.865 --> 01:09:08.205
Be a good king.

1226
01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:10.552
But, wait...
We have to...

1227
01:09:11.438 --> 01:09:12.618
Sele...

1228
01:09:14.432 --> 01:09:15.668
Congratulations, Arthur!

1229
01:09:15.695 --> 01:09:16.970
It was a wonderful wedding.

1230
01:09:16.995 --> 01:09:19.203
Really one of the loveliest weddings
I've ever been to.

1231
01:09:19.248 --> 01:09:21.248
Very moving, clear, concise and quick.

1232
01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:22.929
- Yeah. A little too quick.
- Oh, no, no.

1233
01:09:22.954 --> 01:09:25.174
You got the most important things,
her hand and her heart.

1234
01:09:25.201 --> 01:09:27.020
- What more do you want?
- Well, I don't know.

1235
01:09:27.054 --> 01:09:28.747
Maybe, like a party or something?

1236
01:09:28.787 --> 01:09:30.713
If you would allow me the pleasure,

1237
01:09:30.753 --> 01:09:34.230
I would love to be the one
to organize that party.

1238
01:10:03.785 --> 01:10:06.865
I spent entire days polishing
that sword to perfection.

1239
01:10:06.898 --> 01:10:09.001
I'd recognize that sound anywhere.

1240
01:10:09.055 --> 01:10:10.201
Hmm.

1241
01:10:12.367 --> 01:10:15.831
And who else would have been able
to draw the sword from the stone

1242
01:10:15.864 --> 01:10:18.831
besides you, Selenia?

1243
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:22.030
I am delighted to see you, Princess.

1244
01:10:22.134 --> 01:10:25.373
Likewise!. This way I'll be able to kill
you with my own two hands.

1245
01:10:25.426 --> 01:10:26.642
Why so much hatred?

1246
01:10:26.667 --> 01:10:28.195
Because you betrayed your own people,

1247
01:10:28.242 --> 01:10:31.449
slaughtered entire populations
and bound the rest into slavery.

1248
01:10:31.482 --> 01:10:32.789
You're nothing but a monster.

1249
01:10:32.816 --> 01:10:34.352
Speak not of monsters.

1250
01:10:34.794 --> 01:10:37.422
Nor of things of which you are ignorant.

1251
01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.617
Back in the time when I was
known as Malthazar the Good,

1252
01:10:40.668 --> 01:10:42.423
Malthazar the Bountiful,

1253
01:10:42.463 --> 01:10:44.494
He who watches and protects,

1254
01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:46.952
I inspired such trust and confidence.

1255
01:10:47.001 --> 01:10:48.326
That when the drought came,

1256
01:10:48.366 --> 01:10:50.114
one which lasted a thousand years,

1257
01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:52.294
I was the one they chose for the crusade,

1258
01:10:52.334 --> 01:10:54.574
with the task of bringing back water,
of course,

1259
01:10:54.627 --> 01:10:56.924
but also, all the riches I could reap.

1260
01:10:56.995 --> 01:11:00.038
- Malthazar the Conqueror!
- Oh!

1261
01:11:00.138 --> 01:11:02.765
How they praised
and applauded me when I left.

1262
01:11:02.838 --> 01:11:05.034
But I faced every hardship quite alone.

1263
01:11:05.074 --> 01:11:09.341
The hostile lands, the ferocious beasts,
the bloodthirsty tribes,

1264
01:11:09.388 --> 01:11:12.058
lurking in the depths
of contaminated plateaus

1265
01:11:12.088 --> 01:11:14.346
where even the humans dare not go.

1266
01:11:14.499 --> 01:11:16.359
But I survived all that.

1267
01:11:16.468 --> 01:11:19.835
And having accomplished my mission,
I returned to my village.

1268
01:11:19.935 --> 01:11:22.698
Malthazar the Hero!

1269
01:11:24.198 --> 01:11:27.327
Yet, it was not long before
the diseases and bewitchments,

1270
01:11:27.353 --> 01:11:29.614
which I had encountered
during my voyage,

1271
01:11:29.654 --> 01:11:32.054
began to disfigure my body.

1272
01:11:32.102 --> 01:11:35.397
Fear spread through the people,
fear of contamination.

1273
01:11:35.443 --> 01:11:37.356
People stopped speaking to me.

1274
01:11:37.403 --> 01:11:39.386
They crossed the street
when I approached,

1275
01:11:39.433 --> 01:11:45.099
and very soon, I became
Malthazar the Evil M.

1276
01:11:45.138 --> 01:11:48.366
Uh, uh. The version recorded
in history books is slightly different.

1277
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.867
It is said that when you returned
from your voyage,

1278
01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.732
you celebrated for months on end.

1279
01:11:52.776 --> 01:11:56.123
Each day sinking a little further
into drinking and debauchery,

1280
01:11:56.163 --> 01:11:59.362
until you began keeping company
with the worst kinds of insects,

1281
01:11:59.422 --> 01:12:01.369
even poisonous ones.

1282
01:12:01.535 --> 01:12:03.653
Like a certain pretty, young uh...

1283
01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:04.860
- weevil?
- Silence!

1284
01:12:04.893 --> 01:12:07.113
You gave your powers to her,
she gave her powers to you.

1285
01:12:07.169 --> 01:12:08.906
That's enough, I tell you.

1286
01:12:10.387 --> 01:12:12.027
I was drunk!

1287
01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.756
Ah, well, if you can't hold your liquor,
you shouldn't indulge.

1288
01:12:14.809 --> 01:12:17.495
Yes, I know.
I let myself go abasing

1289
01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:19.695
It's true, she stole a kiss from me.

1290
01:12:19.748 --> 01:12:22.862
One single kiss
which has ruined my entire life

1291
01:12:22.902 --> 01:12:25.704
Next time, try being a little more
selective in your choice of partner.

1292
01:12:25.737 --> 01:12:29.480
Next time, my partner will be
the most beautiful of all.

1293
01:12:29.547 --> 01:12:33.156
She whom I have watched blossom
like a delicate flower,

1294
01:12:33.283 --> 01:12:37.433
and whom I have long dreamt of picking.

1295
01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:40.160
Watch yourself.
Delicate flowers might have thorns.

1296
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:43.363
Yes... And this lovely flower
alone has the power

1297
01:12:43.402 --> 01:12:45.823
to release me from
the spell that binds me

1298
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:48.443
and make me look like
my old self again.

1299
01:12:48.482 --> 01:12:50.732
Only the very first kiss of
a princess has the power.

1300
01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:52.192
I know, and...

1301
01:12:52.239 --> 01:12:56.068
If my information is correct,
you are still unmarried.

1302
01:12:56.302 --> 01:12:59.082
Your information is
a little out-of-date.

1303
01:13:00.354 --> 01:13:02.547
- Master?
- Who dares disturb me?

1304
01:13:02.603 --> 01:13:04.960
It's me Bruce.
I... I got a new helmet.

1305
01:13:05.234 --> 01:13:06.635
Speak up.

1306
01:13:13.043 --> 01:13:16.219
Well, Selenia, you're more clever
than I thought you were.

1307
01:13:16.244 --> 01:13:17.247
Thank you.

1308
01:13:17.272 --> 01:13:19.866
You could have saved my life,
but you chose not to.

1309
01:13:19.926 --> 01:13:22.564
Don't count on me to spare yours.

1310
01:13:23.642 --> 01:13:26.606
Don't worry, Selenia.
You won't die right away.

1311
01:13:26.691 --> 01:13:28.587
You'll just suffer a little first,

1312
01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:31.747
as you watch the destruction
of your people.

1313
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.995
You're a monster, Malthazar.

1314
01:13:34.038 --> 01:13:36.016
I know, I get it from my wife.

1315
01:13:36.123 --> 01:13:37.550
Take her away.

1316
01:13:42.571 --> 01:13:44.477
Leave me alone!
Let me go!

1317
01:13:49.044 --> 01:13:52.338
I'm married for five minutes and I already
feel like a widower, and a jailbird.

1318
01:13:52.363 --> 01:13:54.548
We gotta get out of here, Beta.
We gotta think of something.

1319
01:13:54.594 --> 01:13:56.340
- I'm thinking, Arthur, I'm thinking.
- The powers!

1320
01:13:56.371 --> 01:13:57.919
What about the powers
she gave me when she kissed me?

1321
01:13:57.944 --> 01:13:59.012
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

1322
01:13:59.037 --> 01:14:00.620
Strangling him won't do you any good.

1323
01:14:00.650 --> 01:14:03.353
And besides, you'd better save
your energy if you want to eat.

1324
01:14:03.847 --> 01:14:05.787
- What do you mean?
- If you wanna eat down here,

1325
01:14:05.812 --> 01:14:07.793
you'll have to teach them
something new every day.

1326
01:14:07.826 --> 01:14:09.137
Otherwise, you'll go hungry.

1327
01:14:09.177 --> 01:14:10.773
That makes sense, complete sense.

1328
01:14:10.807 --> 01:14:13.163
Knowledge is the one true source
of wealth, is it not?

1329
01:14:13.190 --> 01:14:14.860
What kinds of things
do they want to know?

1330
01:14:14.885 --> 01:14:15.949
Pfff, anything will do.

1331
01:14:15.974 --> 01:14:18.889
From the elementary laws of physics
to the behavioral patterns of winkles.

1332
01:14:18.916 --> 01:14:20.383
Even how to cook garden peas.

1333
01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:21.523
I taught them to write.

1334
01:14:21.554 --> 01:14:23.675
And to paint, especially huge canvasses.

1335
01:14:23.705 --> 01:14:25.321
And to harness light using mirrors.

1336
01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:27.334
And transport water
from one place to another.

1337
01:14:27.361 --> 01:14:29.480
Yes, that's true.
But how did you know all that?

1338
01:14:29.505 --> 01:14:31.731
Because the man who invented
all those wonderful things,

1339
01:14:31.758 --> 01:14:32.824
he's my grandfather.

1340
01:14:32.857 --> 01:14:34.502
- Arthur?
- Grandpa!

1341
01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:36.149
Oh my grandson!

1342
01:14:36.236 --> 01:14:39.102
Oh, I'm so happy to see you again.

1343
01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:40.628
Let me look at you.

1344
01:14:40.682 --> 01:14:42.001
My, how you've grown!

1345
01:14:42.039 --> 01:14:44.435
- It feels more like I've shrunk.
- Yes, that's true.

1346
01:14:44.475 --> 01:14:46.112
But how did you manage
to get down here?

1347
01:14:46.145 --> 01:14:47.698
Well, I found your riddle.

1348
01:14:47.738 --> 01:14:49.618
Oh, yes, of course, my riddle.

1349
01:14:49.644 --> 01:14:51.618
Oh, you are a true hero!

1350
01:14:51.664 --> 01:14:53.530
Hello, Archibald.
Remember me?

1351
01:14:53.606 --> 01:14:56.614
- Betameche, is that really you?
- Uh-huh.

1352
01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.502
Oh, I'm so happy to see you again.

1353
01:14:58.540 --> 01:14:59.983
How is your father, that noble king?

1354
01:15:00.010 --> 01:15:01.185
Very well indeed, thank you.

1355
01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:04.508
And your sister,
the charming Princess Selenia?

1356
01:15:04.608 --> 01:15:05.941
- Ah...
- Oh.

1357
01:15:06.861 --> 01:15:08.303
- Selenia.
- Selenia.

1358
01:15:08.736 --> 01:15:10.462
I failed, Arthur.

1359
01:15:10.602 --> 01:15:12.169
I'm sorry.

1360
01:15:12.596 --> 01:15:13.842
All is lost.

1361
01:15:13.939 --> 01:15:16.302
No, as long as we're still alive
and love each other,

1362
01:15:16.336 --> 01:15:17.596
nothing will ever be lost.

1363
01:15:17.622 --> 01:15:19.178
You're so full of hope.

1364
01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:20.925
You can never give up hope.

1365
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.991
Look at me.

1366
01:15:22.019 --> 01:15:23.972
Only yesterday,
I was just a small, lonely kid,

1367
01:15:24.007 --> 01:15:26.847
and today, well,
I married a princess.

1368
01:15:27.003 --> 01:15:28.863
A happy princess.

1369
01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:32.477
Because she's finally
found her prince charming.

1370
01:15:36.559 --> 01:15:38.602
W- W-Whoa! Time out!
I don't mean to be rude,

1371
01:15:38.629 --> 01:15:40.599
but don't you think you should
maybe respect the tradition?

1372
01:15:40.626 --> 01:15:41.706
Uh, Heu, heu.

1373
01:15:41.731 --> 01:15:44.036
Yes, he's right.
What was I thinking?

1374
01:15:44.242 --> 01:15:45.738
- Euh-euh.
- Oh, hey!

1375
01:15:45.839 --> 01:15:47.845
Archibald!
How are you?

1376
01:15:47.872 --> 01:15:49.587
Well, actually, not bad at all, Selenia.

1377
01:15:49.607 --> 01:15:52.315
- What a pleasure to see you again!
- Likewise, likewise!

1378
01:15:52.349 --> 01:15:54.215
Selenia, what's this tradition business?

1379
01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.676
Once the first kiss has been exchanged,

1380
01:15:55.707 --> 01:15:57.030
then you have to wait
another thousand years,

1381
01:15:57.056 --> 01:15:59.143
because then desire and
faith have to be put to the test.

1382
01:15:59.173 --> 01:16:00.836
That which is rare
is always valued highly.

1383
01:16:00.874 --> 01:16:01.956
She has a point, you know?

1384
01:16:01.983 --> 01:16:03.446
And as a Princess, it is my duty

1385
01:16:03.473 --> 01:16:05.533
to follow the teachings of the Great Book.

1386
01:16:05.566 --> 01:16:08.273
Besides, you ought to do the same,
instead of trying to steal kisses from me.

1387
01:16:08.306 --> 01:16:10.146
Me? It wasn't me.
You were the one...

1388
01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:14.057
Come along my two lovebirds.

1389
01:16:14.150 --> 01:16:15.804
It's Showtime!

1390
01:16:17.663 --> 01:16:18.983
If you would care to...

1391
01:16:19.117 --> 01:16:20.617
Gate open, boss.

1392
01:16:33.277 --> 01:16:34.350
My God!

1393
01:16:34.375 --> 01:16:36.190
When I think that it was I
that taught them all this,

1394
01:16:36.217 --> 01:16:37.728
and now they're gonna
use it against us.

1395
01:16:37.753 --> 01:16:40.260
When I think that I was the one
who gave them the straws.

1396
01:16:53.422 --> 01:16:55.648
Look, it's Mino, Miro's son.
He's still alive.

1397
01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:02.131
The treasure.

1398
01:17:06.592 --> 01:17:08.558
Ah, Archibald.

1399
01:17:08.598 --> 01:17:10.878
What a great pleasure it is
to see you again!

1400
01:17:10.911 --> 01:17:13.086
- The pleasure is all yours.
- So, Archibald,

1401
01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:16.620
aren't you proud of the marvelous use
I've made of your knowledge?

1402
01:17:16.646 --> 01:17:17.828
Looks like a fine structure.

1403
01:17:17.853 --> 01:17:20.109
A shame its only purpose
is to flood the Minimoys.

1404
01:17:20.142 --> 01:17:21.249
Oh no, not only that.

1405
01:17:21.275 --> 01:17:23.036
We are going to drown them,
pulverize them,

1406
01:17:23.063 --> 01:17:25.003
and destroy them forever.

1407
01:17:25.085 --> 01:17:28.392
They will die in agony
with my name on their lips.

1408
01:17:28.475 --> 01:17:30.595
Look, read my lips.

1409
01:17:30.642 --> 01:17:33.512
Mal - tha - zar.

1410
01:17:33.608 --> 01:17:35.265
You really are a monster.

1411
01:17:35.311 --> 01:17:37.512
Maybe.
But I also know how to be noble.

1412
01:17:37.555 --> 01:17:39.472
You are free.

1413
01:17:43.706 --> 01:17:44.726
See?

1414
01:17:44.752 --> 01:17:46.639
All you have to do
is follow this tunnel

1415
01:17:46.666 --> 01:17:48.200
and you'll be home in no time.

1416
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:50.036
As soon as we're inside that tunnel,
you'll flood it.

1417
01:17:50.076 --> 01:17:52.874
My poor Selenia.
What a twisted mind you have!

1418
01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:54.944
Come on, hurry up,
before I change my mind.

1419
01:17:54.985 --> 01:17:56.475
- Sire?
- What is it now?

1420
01:17:56.500 --> 01:18:00.033
May I ask Your Highness to grant me
one last favor before I die.

1421
01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:02.445
I like this kid.
What is this favor?

1422
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:04.392
I would like to leave
my only valued possession,

1423
01:18:04.432 --> 01:18:06.609
this bracelet, to my friend, Mino.

1424
01:18:10.308 --> 01:18:11.642
Granted.

1425
01:18:13.192 --> 01:18:15.412
Your father sent me.
I'll get you out of here.

1426
01:18:15.445 --> 01:18:18.178
But you need to signal
your position at noon precisely.

1427
01:18:18.203 --> 01:18:19.925
Si, si, si, signal my position, but how?

1428
01:18:19.958 --> 01:18:21.794
Using your mirrors, Mino, mirrors.

1429
01:18:21.834 --> 01:18:24.112
- Oh, yes, mi-mi-mi-mi-mirrors.
- That's enough.

1430
01:18:24.146 --> 01:18:26.972
Patience is the only thing
for which I set myself a limit.

1431
01:18:27.019 --> 01:18:28.441
At noon.
High noon on the dot.

1432
01:18:28.475 --> 01:18:31.902
I shall allow you a head start
of three minutes.

1433
01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.233
I hope he burns in hell.

1434
01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.380
He's already there, Selenia.
Hurry!

1435
01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.503
- Darkos?
- Yes, father?

1436
01:18:41.543 --> 01:18:43.896
Prepare to open the floodgates

1437
01:18:45.509 --> 01:18:46.936
Come on, come on!

1438
01:18:49.008 --> 01:18:50.522
Is there nothing to nibble?

1439
01:18:50.568 --> 01:18:53.368
I do love something to nibble on
during a good show.

1440
01:18:54.679 --> 01:18:56.103
I can't go on.

1441
01:18:56.176 --> 01:18:57.843
And what's the point
in running anyway?

1442
01:18:57.889 --> 01:18:59.296
Grandpa, come on, hurry.

1443
01:18:59.336 --> 01:19:01.292
You go on.
I'm staying here.

1444
01:19:01.332 --> 01:19:04.079
To await my death with a little dignity.

1445
01:19:04.124 --> 01:19:05.751
Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.

1446
01:19:05.786 --> 01:19:07.289
Arthur, what's the point?

1447
01:19:07.382 --> 01:19:09.737
You must face up to it, son.
We're done for.

1448
01:19:12.176 --> 01:19:14.429
Your Highness, a few tasty titbits.

1449
01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:20.477
Mmm, delicious.
Bring me more.

1450
01:19:20.544 --> 01:19:21.771
Yes, master.

1451
01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:24.458
There must be a solution.
There's always a solution.

1452
01:19:24.496 --> 01:19:27.438
The only solution is to pray,
my children. Pray for a miracle.

1453
01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:29.079
The problem is, I've already asked
the Great Goddess of the Forest

1454
01:19:29.104 --> 01:19:30.124
for so many miracles.

1455
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:31.711
I'm afraid she might get mad.

1456
01:19:38.814 --> 01:19:40.408
- A miracle!
- A miracle?

1457
01:19:40.441 --> 01:19:41.854
- Where?
- Right here, Grandpa.

1458
01:19:41.895 --> 01:19:43.948
You're sitting on it.
Look.

1459
01:19:44.438 --> 01:19:46.051
Come and give me a hand.

1460
01:19:47.686 --> 01:19:49.352
Come on, push!

1461
01:19:53.075 --> 01:19:54.948
- What is this thing?
- It's a car.

1462
01:19:54.975 --> 01:19:58.381
It's a Ferrari 250 GTI 12-cylinder.
It's a birthday present.

1463
01:19:58.408 --> 01:19:59.777
Don't tell me you know
how to drive that thing?

1464
01:19:59.802 --> 01:20:02.277
Of course I do. If the young lady
would care to step this way.

1465
01:20:02.303 --> 01:20:04.138
Oh, God, whatever!

1466
01:20:09.099 --> 01:20:10.599
Bingo!

1467
01:20:27.303 --> 01:20:28.339
Hurry, Arthur.

1468
01:20:28.366 --> 01:20:30.903
If we want make it the whole way,
we have to wind it up as far as it will go.

1469
01:20:30.929 --> 01:20:32.159
Arthur, the water is coming.

1470
01:20:32.184 --> 01:20:34.010
- Arthur, please.
- Got it.

1471
01:20:34.056 --> 01:20:36.422
This is the first time I've ever
taken a girl out for a drive.

1472
01:20:36.447 --> 01:20:37.976
Well, let's just hope
it won't be the last.

1473
01:20:38.003 --> 01:20:39.690
- Step on it.
- We're off.

1474
01:20:42.607 --> 01:20:44.841
- Faster!
- Faster!

1475
01:20:49.115 --> 01:20:51.689
I just hope there aren't any speed
cameras down here or we've had it.

1476
01:20:51.731 --> 01:20:53.175
Hey, go to the left.

1477
01:20:57.111 --> 01:21:00.124
I'd appreciate a little more warning
next time if that's ok with you?

1478
01:21:00.157 --> 01:21:01.544
Okay.
Turn right.

1479
01:21:03.982 --> 01:21:06.229
- Which way do I go now, left or right?
- Down.

1480
01:21:10.102 --> 01:21:12.515
- Selenia, I don't feel so good.
- Just hang in there.

1481
01:21:12.542 --> 01:21:14.082
The road is smoother now.

1482
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:25.821
Honey, do you hear that strange noise?

1483
01:21:25.846 --> 01:21:27.633
It sounds like there's
running water underneath.

1484
01:21:27.658 --> 01:21:30.816
Oh great. Now you're hearing voices
just like Joan of Arc did.

1485
01:21:30.889 --> 01:21:33.562
Next thing you know you're
gonna be seeing little angels

1486
01:21:33.595 --> 01:21:37.478
and great big ghosts with spears
and armour coming after you.

1487
01:21:37.518 --> 01:21:38.754
Wait, wait.
You might want to turn around.

1488
01:21:38.788 --> 01:21:42.954
There's, well,  large men with necklaces
and feathers, and I don't know.

1489
01:21:45.636 --> 01:21:46.950
What the...

1490
01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:52.878
Would you happen
to have the time, please?

1491
01:21:52.931 --> 01:21:54.624
The time.
Sure.

1492
01:21:54.703 --> 01:21:56.163
According to our calculations,

1493
01:21:56.219 --> 01:21:59.363
the water should hit the village
in three balls time.

1494
01:22:00.129 --> 01:22:01.709
What time is it, my dear Miro?

1495
01:22:01.814 --> 01:22:03.313
Five to noon, my good King.

1496
01:22:03.359 --> 01:22:05.510
Only five minutes left
and still no news.

1497
01:22:05.535 --> 01:22:08.123
Have faith in them, my good King.
I am sure they will succeed.

1498
01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:10.952
May the Gods hear you, Miro,
may the gods hear you!

1499
01:22:21.334 --> 01:22:22.754
Look, there's the gate!

1500
01:22:24.167 --> 01:22:26.394
We made it.
Yes. Yeah!

1501
01:22:28.397 --> 01:22:29.776
Huh?

1502
01:22:30.263 --> 01:22:32.635
Arthur, you're not going
break down on us now?

1503
01:22:32.668 --> 01:22:35.715
Sorry, I guess we're gonna
have to get out and run!!!

1504
01:22:39.072 --> 01:22:40.659
What, what is that rumbling noise?

1505
01:22:40.686 --> 01:22:43.512
I have no idea, Sire.
But I have a terrible foreboding.

1506
01:22:43.686 --> 01:22:46.019
Father, it's me, Selenia!

1507
01:22:46.047 --> 01:22:47.456
My daughter!
They've returned.

1508
01:22:47.503 --> 01:22:49.192
- Open the gate!
- Open the gate!

1509
01:22:49.286 --> 01:22:50.414
Yes, yes.

1510
01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:51.939
Open the gate now!

1511
01:22:58.619 --> 01:22:59.766
Close the gate immediately!

1512
01:22:59.812 --> 01:23:01.879
Open it, close it.
Make up your mind.

1513
01:23:01.912 --> 01:23:03.312
All together now!

1514
01:23:14.968 --> 01:23:16.708
You did it Daddy, you did it.

1515
01:23:16.734 --> 01:23:20.011
You are now the uncontested Master
of all the Kingdoms.

1516
01:23:20.048 --> 01:23:23.193
Heaven knows I don't care
about titles and honors,

1517
01:23:23.215 --> 01:23:26.981
but I must admit that it does
feel good to be Supreme Ruler.

1518
01:23:27.082 --> 01:23:29.168
- Let us prepare ourselves.
- Yeah, Daddy.

1519
01:23:31.915 --> 01:23:34.320
- The gate looks as if it will hold.
- Not for long.

1520
01:23:34.354 --> 01:23:35.713
Oh, my children!

1521
01:23:35.767 --> 01:23:37.214
- Papa!
- Daddy!

1522
01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:38.394
- Oh.
- Mmm.

1523
01:23:38.474 --> 01:23:39.855
We missed you, Papa.

1524
01:23:39.895 --> 01:23:43.978
Oh, my children, you're this old king's
most prized possessions.

1525
01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:05.475
What's wrong?

1526
01:24:07.315 --> 01:24:09.871
No, no, no, the phone's cut off.
It doesn't work.

1527
01:24:10.049 --> 01:24:11.371
What is wrong?!

1528
01:24:11.745 --> 01:24:13.398
Out... Out there!!

1529
01:24:13.571 --> 01:24:15.144
- What's out there?
- Five.

1530
01:24:15.249 --> 01:24:17.438
- Five what?
- Black!

1531
01:24:17.559 --> 01:24:20.125
- What are you talking about?
- They're huge.

1532
01:24:20.358 --> 01:24:21.953
Where're you going?
Don't leave me here.

1533
01:24:21.978 --> 01:24:23.225
No, Granny, please.

1534
01:24:26.203 --> 01:24:28.589
It's noon!

1535
01:24:29.416 --> 01:24:31.069
In one minute!

1536
01:24:32.086 --> 01:24:34.046
Hurry now.
You only have one minute.

1537
01:24:34.622 --> 01:24:36.675
We can only hold the water back
for about an hour,

1538
01:24:36.708 --> 01:24:38.335
but I know that I can depend on you.

1539
01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.968
After all, you're one of us now.

1540
01:24:39.996 --> 01:24:42.492
And I hope you know that
you're always welcome back here.

1541
01:24:42.859 --> 01:24:45.806
Ah! And a second turn of
the wheel for the spirit.

1542
01:24:47.242 --> 01:24:49.096
Our lives are in your hands, my friend.

1543
01:24:49.122 --> 01:24:50.762
We're counting on you and your grandson.

1544
01:24:50.789 --> 01:24:53.959
Don't worry. Arthur has a plan
and I'm sure it's gonna work.

1545
01:24:55.972 --> 01:24:58.332
Uh, it's going to pretty dull
around here without you.

1546
01:24:58.383 --> 01:24:59.444
Come back soon, huh?

1547
01:24:59.478 --> 01:25:01.367
At the tenth moon.
That's a promise.

1548
01:25:01.412 --> 01:25:03.250
He, he, he... Ha!

1549
01:25:06.284 --> 01:25:08.247
Ten moons, that gives us plenty of time

1550
01:25:08.284 --> 01:25:11.117
to put our desire to the test
and respect the protocol.

1551
01:25:11.587 --> 01:25:13.380
The hell with the protocol.

1552
01:25:16.078 --> 01:25:18.725
And a third turn of
the wheel for the soul.

1553
01:25:19.875 --> 01:25:21.542
Oh, oh, my God!
Oh!

1554
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:32.463
Whoaaa!

1555
01:25:37.211 --> 01:25:38.587
See you...

1556
01:25:39.214 --> 01:25:40.927
in ten moons!

1557
01:25:45.897 --> 01:25:48.057
Ah!
Thank you.

1558
01:25:48.124 --> 01:25:50.037
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

1559
01:25:51.149 --> 01:25:53.090
Mom?
Mom!

1560
01:25:53.130 --> 01:25:54.250
- Mom?
- Eh!

1561
01:25:54.296 --> 01:25:56.530
Honey... Out.
What...

1562
01:25:57.584 --> 01:25:58.658
Oh!

1563
01:25:59.538 --> 01:26:00.992
Arthur!

1564
01:26:01.998 --> 01:26:04.578
- Where have you been?
- I was with the Minimoys.

1565
01:26:04.612 --> 01:26:06.676
- The Min... Mini what?
- The Minimoys.

1566
01:26:06.864 --> 01:26:10.292
Ooh! Ha, ha!

1567
01:26:11.185 --> 01:26:12.465
Mom?!

1568
01:26:12.541 --> 01:26:13.916
Granpa!

1569
01:26:14.490 --> 01:26:15.856
Are you okay?

1570
01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:17.390
My brothers!!

1571
01:26:17.451 --> 01:26:18.536
Oh!

1572
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:20.470
I'm so glad to see you again.

1573
01:26:23.174 --> 01:26:24.214
- Grandpa!
- What?

1574
01:26:24.239 --> 01:26:25.781
We've got no time left!
We've gotta go!

1575
01:26:25.819 --> 01:26:27.260
You're right.

1576
01:26:29.106 --> 01:26:31.286
Noon on the dot.

1577
01:26:31.406 --> 01:26:33.059
And no one in sight.

1578
01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:35.924
I'm afraid, though it is
a beautiful Sunday,

1579
01:26:35.964 --> 01:26:39.817
despite it being the day of our Lord,
there seems to be no miracle.

1580
01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:40.890
So,...

1581
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:43.909
You're right, Davido.

1582
01:26:43.952 --> 01:26:46.921
It is a beautiful, beautiful Sunday.

1583
01:26:46.946 --> 01:26:49.545
I believe we have some papers to sign,
am I right?

1584
01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:52.504
Let's go in the living room,
we'll be more comfortable.

1585
01:26:57.309 --> 01:26:59.729
While I try to buy time,
you get busy finding the treasure.

1586
01:26:59.765 --> 01:27:00.842
Okay.

1587
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:09.619
Mino!

1588
01:27:09.810 --> 01:27:11.343
Mino, where are you?

1589
01:27:12.219 --> 01:27:13.276
Mino!

1590
01:27:13.556 --> 01:27:15.183
This is not gonna be easy.

1591
01:27:21.019 --> 01:27:22.204
Light!

1592
01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.263
I promised you riches and power,

1593
01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:50.343
and Maltazard always
keeps his promises.

1594
01:27:50.419 --> 01:27:52.419
Nothing can stop us now.

1595
01:27:52.486 --> 01:27:55.183
The Seven Kingdoms are... mine.

1596
01:27:57.587 --> 01:27:59.485
I mean, of course, ours.

1597
01:27:59.879 --> 01:28:01.249
BRAVO!

1598
01:28:03.102 --> 01:28:04.229
What?

1599
01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.469
Ex... Excuse me.

1600
01:28:05.502 --> 01:28:08.449
Could you tell me what time it is?
I'm kind of far-sighted.

1601
01:28:09.844 --> 01:28:11.197
Uh, noon!

1602
01:28:11.327 --> 01:28:12.327
Thank you.

1603
01:28:12.384 --> 01:28:14.437
My fearless and faithful warriors,

1604
01:28:14.464 --> 01:28:16.683
let the festivities begin.

1605
01:28:21.764 --> 01:28:23.324
Now if I do the exact opposite,

1606
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:26.926
the light, which reflects downwards,
should then reflect upwards.

1607
01:28:35.163 --> 01:28:36.983
Mino!
You're the best.

1608
01:28:39.223 --> 01:28:40.309
What the...?

1609
01:28:40.336 --> 01:28:41.830
What is he doing?
Darkos!

1610
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:43.529
That idiot will give our position away.

1611
01:28:43.554 --> 01:28:44.954
Make him cut that beam immediately.

1612
01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:47.016
- Cut the beam.
- Huh? Oh, sorry.

1613
01:28:47.076 --> 01:28:49.389
Because I'm far sighted,
but I'm also hard of hearing.

1614
01:28:49.423 --> 01:28:53.003
You fool! You will be sorry
that you defied Malthazar.

1615
01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.016
Oh, it's nothing, really.

1616
01:29:01.090 --> 01:29:02.383
Bring him here.

1617
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:04.309
W, w, w, watch out!
I can get really nasty.

1618
01:29:04.363 --> 01:29:07.110
Ha! Ha! Sure you can.
Come on, show us.

1619
01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:14.116
I got it. Stop it.
I got it, I got it.

1620
01:29:23.564 --> 01:29:25.504
What is this thing?

1621
01:29:25.538 --> 01:29:26.554
I know, I know.

1622
01:29:26.588 --> 01:29:29.221
Oh gracious Lord, it's a kind of...

1623
01:29:49.371 --> 01:29:50.894
Oh, water.

1624
01:29:51.654 --> 01:29:54.974
- Daddy, they've blocked the pipe.
- Damn!

1625
01:29:55.034 --> 01:29:57.081
Father, what shall I do?

1626
01:30:02.426 --> 01:30:03.519
What about me, Father?

1627
01:30:03.552 --> 01:30:04.866
As for you, my son,...

1628
01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:08.772
I hereby solemnly appoint you
Commander of the lmperial Forces.

1629
01:30:08.812 --> 01:30:10.895
Oh, thank you, Father.
That's nice but...

1630
01:30:10.922 --> 01:30:13.501
you wouldn't have a place left on
that mosquito of yours, would you?

1631
01:30:13.531 --> 01:30:16.144
A Commander never deserts his post.

1632
01:30:18.589 --> 01:30:21.151
Father!
Daddy!

1633
01:30:26.968 --> 01:30:28.212
Mino?

1634
01:30:28.938 --> 01:30:30.291
Come out.

1635
01:30:32.178 --> 01:30:33.358
Yes!

1636
01:30:39.795 --> 01:30:40.962
More coffee?

1637
01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:43.015
No! No more coffee!
Thank you!

1638
01:30:43.112 --> 01:30:45.338
But what I would love is
for you to sign the paper.

1639
01:30:45.375 --> 01:30:47.900
Of course.
What did I do with my pen?

1640
01:30:50.193 --> 01:30:51.799
Oh, what a lovely pen!

1641
01:30:51.846 --> 01:30:53.566
We have wasted enough time.

1642
01:30:53.662 --> 01:30:55.319
- Sign!
- Of course.

1643
01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:02.673
And now...

1644
01:31:04.343 --> 01:31:05.499
The money.

1645
01:31:05.566 --> 01:31:06.599
Huh?

1646
01:31:06.656 --> 01:31:08.339
Oh! The money, yes.

1647
01:31:08.399 --> 01:31:11.126
I'd like to see how you're gonna
pull one of your tricks now.

1648
01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.587
Here.

1649
01:31:14.656 --> 01:31:16.973
Bravo my boy!

1650
01:31:21.395 --> 01:31:23.021
So then...

1651
01:31:23.628 --> 01:31:26.608
Good accounts make for good friends,
isn't that right?

1652
01:31:27.257 --> 01:31:28.820
There you are.

1653
01:31:28.893 --> 01:31:30.927
Paid in full.

1654
01:31:37.557 --> 01:31:40.492
Sir, I must now be saying goodbye.

1655
01:31:40.923 --> 01:31:41.973
Goodbye now.

1656
01:31:41.998 --> 01:31:43.253
Goodbye!

1657
01:31:50.882 --> 01:31:53.435
Ha! Ha! Ha!

1658
01:31:53.515 --> 01:31:55.082
Congratulations!

1659
01:31:55.734 --> 01:31:57.830
Nobody move!
I said.

1660
01:32:05.424 --> 01:32:08.083
So that's why you had
your sights set on this land?

1661
01:32:08.125 --> 01:32:11.263
Of course. The call of greed,
now and forever.

1662
01:32:11.305 --> 01:32:14.232
One night you had a few too many.
And you told me about this treasure.

1663
01:32:14.272 --> 01:32:16.572
And ever since, I have not
had a good night's sleep.

1664
01:32:16.625 --> 01:32:18.568
But now, it's mine!

1665
01:32:18.595 --> 01:32:20.394
Thanks kid.
Nice job.

1666
01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:24.388
Well, I'll be saying my farewells.
You won't be seeing me ever again.

1667
01:32:24.421 --> 01:32:28.697
Because I am going far, far away.

1668
01:32:29.697 --> 01:32:32.360
You're coming with me.
C'mon.

1669
01:32:33.001 --> 01:32:36.087
Get your hands off me.
I know the govenor.

1670
01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:42.024
Oh, I'll take that.
I'll take that.

1671
01:32:42.058 --> 01:32:44.378
Next time, please,
put your gift in a safer place.

1672
01:32:44.411 --> 01:32:46.611
- That's a promise.
- We will. I'll, I'll take it.

1673
01:32:46.638 --> 01:32:48.412
It's much safer with me.

1674
01:33:10.293 --> 01:33:13.441
Don't worry Mino.
I'm gonna take care of you.

1675
01:33:22.165 --> 01:33:23.485
They did it!

1676
01:33:23.559 --> 01:33:25.815
Yes! They did it!
They did it!

1677
01:33:25.862 --> 01:33:28.595
My daughter.
My son.

1678
01:33:29.369 --> 01:33:30.715
Oh, boy.

1679
01:33:31.912 --> 01:33:33.099
Heh!!!

1680
01:33:35.231 --> 01:33:38.054
Oh, I would love
my little Mino to see this.

1681
01:33:38.359 --> 01:33:41.769
I understand Miro,
but our people are safe and sound,

1682
01:33:41.826 --> 01:33:43.817
and that is something
to be thankful for.

1683
01:33:43.849 --> 01:33:45.429
Of course, of course.

1684
01:33:52.959 --> 01:33:55.873
Wait, I...
I think I know what it is.

1685
01:33:58.473 --> 01:33:59.786
Hey! It's Mino!

1686
01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.696
Mino, my son!

1687
01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:02.823
Papa!

1688
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:04.490
Oh, my boy.

1689
01:34:07.195 --> 01:34:08.762
Well, there you go.

1690
01:34:08.827 --> 01:34:10.202
All's well that ends well.

1691
01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:11.420
Not quite.

1692
01:34:14.095 --> 01:34:15.275
May I?

1693
01:34:51.997 --> 01:34:53.786
I think it's ready.
Excuse me.

1694
01:35:01.864 --> 01:35:03.857
I propose a toast!

1695
01:35:03.927 --> 01:35:05.588
- Here!
- Here!

1696
01:35:05.841 --> 01:35:07.240
Here it comes.

1697
01:35:07.471 --> 01:35:08.624
Honey.

1698
01:35:10.076 --> 01:35:12.089
- What is that?
- My favorite dish.

1699
01:35:12.142 --> 01:35:13.949
African giraffe's neck.

1700
01:35:14.015 --> 01:35:15.825
Oh! Archibald!

1701
01:35:15.887 --> 01:35:17.004
What?

1702
01:35:17.131 --> 01:35:18.304
Ay!

1703
01:35:18.485 --> 01:35:20.565
Honey! Honey! Rosie!

1704
01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:22.380
- I was only kidding.
- Come on.

1705
01:35:22.413 --> 01:35:24.226
- Rosie! Rosie! Wake up, honey!
- Ow!

1706
01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:27.953
Every time she gets a little excited,
over she goes.

1707
01:35:28.684 --> 01:35:29.724
I think some other...

1708
01:35:29.765 --> 01:35:31.089
Where's Arthur?

1709
01:35:31.617 --> 01:35:33.010
Euh, he...

1710
01:35:33.097 --> 01:35:35.923
just went to wash up.
He'll be back in a jiffy.

1711
01:35:50.961 --> 01:35:53.589
