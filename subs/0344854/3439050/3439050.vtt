00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.777
My name is Archibald...
Archibald Suchot.

2
00:01:01.383 --> 00:01:03.681
I'm an engineer
and I spent more than 10 years

3
00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:06.812
in Africa building
every type of useful things.

4
00:01:08.657 --> 00:01:12.753
By the way, it's in the heart
of Africa that our story begins...

5
00:01:16.732 --> 00:01:19.360
Well, this is not Africa,
this is Connecticut

6
00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:22.869
and this is the house I lived in before
I mysteriously disappeared.

7
00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:26.408
But that's another story that my grandson
would be more qualified to tell you.

8
00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:29.806
You will see he is a lovely charming
kid who answer to the name of...

9
00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:33.609
Arthur!!

10
00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:36.646
Where's he gone to this time?!

11
00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:41.020
And the dog's disappeared too!!!

12
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.652
Alfred!!?

13
00:01:43.392 --> 00:01:46.190
"Oh yes, you'll see,"
"he'll be a great guard dog!"

14
00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:47.489
Alfred!!!

15
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.291
I wonder what exactly
it is he'll be guarding!

16
00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.037
Oh...

17
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.301
If you could at least answer when I call!

18
00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:07.942
Arthur?

19
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:09.818
Arthur!!

20
00:02:10.052 --> 00:02:11.610
Ha! An attack! Men, come to my aid!!

21
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.311
Calm down!

22
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:13.615
It's me! Granny!

23
00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.321
Sorry! I was in Africa!

24
00:02:16.425 --> 00:02:18.518
I can tell!
Did you have a good trip?

25
00:02:18.627 --> 00:02:20.857
Fantastic! I was in a tribe with Grandpa!

26
00:02:20.963 --> 00:02:23.864
Look! Grandpa painted a canvas
that he placed in a circle

27
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:26.901
that way the animals pace
round and round it, but can't find us.

28
00:02:27.036 --> 00:02:27.900
It's like we're invisible.

29
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:30.062
Invisible, but not unsmellable!

30
00:02:30.172 --> 00:02:31.605
Did you have your bath this morning?

31
00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:33.800
- I was on my way when I found this book!
- Hmm,

32
00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:34.876
It's incredible!

33
00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.468
It's all the inventions Grandpa
made for the isolated tribes.

34
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.105
Yes. He was more interested in African
tribes than he was his own!

35
00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:40.648
Look!

36
00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:41.841
He dug a super deep well

37
00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:44.579
and invented a whole irrigation system
out of bamboo poles.

38
00:02:44.687 --> 00:02:48.179
You know, it wasn't Grandpa
who invented that, it was the Romans.

39
00:02:48.657 --> 00:02:50.488
They called them viaducts.

40
00:02:50.593 --> 00:02:51.525
The Romans?

41
00:02:51.894 --> 00:02:53.327
I never heard of that tribe!

42
00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.465
Oh, it's a very old tribe,
the leader was called Caesar.

43
00:02:57.633 --> 00:02:58.827
Like the salad?

44
00:02:59.034 --> 00:03:00.524
Yes, like the salad.

45
00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:04.103
Put that book back where you got it,
we have to go shopping!

46
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.037
Granny, please, can I drive on the way back?

47
00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:11.635
I don't know, Arthur, we'll see.

48
00:03:11.747 --> 00:03:15.945
- Oh, please, Grandpa would always...
- Grandpa's not here and I'm in charge.

49
00:03:35.204 --> 00:03:37.638
- Good day, Mrs. Suchot!
- Oh, officer, hello!

50
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.002
Always a pleasure to see you in town.

51
00:03:39.108 --> 00:03:40.973
Thank you, officer,
always a pleasure to see you too.

52
00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:42.600
- Good day, officer!
- Good day.

53
00:03:43.178 --> 00:03:46.443
Arthur, hum, here,
here's the shopping list, and I'm,

54
00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:47.810
I'm just gonna run across the street

55
00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:50.750
for five minutes
so I'll meet you at the check out counter.

56
00:03:50.853 --> 00:03:51.785
Can I buy some straws?

57
00:03:51.887 --> 00:03:53.218
Yeah, as many as you like.

58
00:03:59.995 --> 00:04:02.088
- Did he follow you?
- I don't think so.

59
00:04:02.197 --> 00:04:04.495
Perfect! Perfect!

60
00:04:05.034 --> 00:04:06.399
There! It's all there.

61
00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:08.527
Perfect, this is wonderful thank you so much.

62
00:04:08.637 --> 00:04:10.127
- What do I owe you?
- Are you crazy, nothing!

63
00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:10.898
Nothing at all!

64
00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:12.473
Now, get going before he catches you.

65
00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:14.508
I'm speechless, I don't know how thank you!

66
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.440
By letting me participate!

67
00:04:15.544 --> 00:04:16.875
Nothing could make me happier!

68
00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.879
- Now, get going!
- Thanks so much.

69
00:04:18.981 --> 00:04:20.744
I'm counting on you to
let me know how it went?

70
00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.579
- I'll call you tomorrow!
- Talk to you tomorrow! Bye.

71
00:04:23.686 --> 00:04:24.812
Bye.

72
00:04:30.025 --> 00:04:30.719
Oh Arthur!

73
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.559
Arthur, no, no, no it's fine.

74
00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:33.685
You go off and play.

75
00:04:33.796 --> 00:04:35.525
- Go off while it's still light!
- Sure? Thanks Granny!

76
00:04:35.631 --> 00:04:37.189
Absolutely. Sure.

77
00:04:41.904 --> 00:04:42.893
Yes!

78
00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:45.230
Yes! World champion!

79
00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:47.069
Alfred!

80
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:51.971
Watch carefully, Alfred!

81
00:04:52.081 --> 00:04:54.447
You are about to witness the invention of

82
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.213
the largest irrigation system in the county.

83
00:04:58.554 --> 00:05:03.423
Bigger than Grandpa's, better than Caesar's.

84
00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:09.230
This is Arthur's invention!

85
00:05:20.042 --> 00:05:21.066
Perfect!

86
00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:24.007
By the grace of God!

87
00:05:36.225 --> 00:05:37.055
Yes!

88
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.558
Alfred! Congratulations!

89
00:05:40.662 --> 00:05:43.961
It's a remarkable invention
that'll go down in history! Believe me!

90
00:05:44.066 --> 00:05:46.057
Arthur! Telephone!!

91
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:47.930
You'll have to excuse me! Probably the

92
00:05:48.037 --> 00:05:49.834
uh, president calling to congratulate me.

93
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.872
Hey! I built an irrigation
system like Caesar's!

94
00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:55.409
Off Now the radishes
will grow twice as fast!

95
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:58.309
Is this my honey pie?! Who is this "Seesher"?

96
00:05:58.414 --> 00:05:59.346
One of Grandpa's colleagues...

97
00:05:59.448 --> 00:06:02.315
But I followed Grandpa's blueprints
and it works really well!

98
00:06:02.418 --> 00:06:04.886
I hope you can get here
before nighttimes so you can see it...

99
00:06:04.987 --> 00:06:05.817
Where are you now?

100
00:06:05.921 --> 00:06:06.444
Um...

101
00:06:06.555 --> 00:06:08.546
Well, we're still in the city, Arthur.

102
00:06:08.657 --> 00:06:09.316
Huh?! Oh...

103
00:06:09.425 --> 00:06:11.256
Well... I guess you'll see it
tomorrow morning then?

104
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.329
Um... No, we're not going to
able to make it Arthur,

105
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.091
but even though we can't be there,

106
00:06:16.198 --> 00:06:18.393
we wanted to tell you
that we're thinking of you...

107
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.765
because... today is... your birthday!!

108
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.100
Happy Birthday son!

109
00:06:24.206 --> 00:06:26.470
Thought we'd forgot, didn't you!

110
00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:29.004
But ten years old is a big deal!

111
00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:31.136
You're a big boy now, aren't you?

112
00:06:31.246 --> 00:06:32.679
So how did you like the present?

113
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:34.442
- We haven't gotten it yet, you idiot!
- What?

114
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.518
No, I fixed it with Granny.

115
00:06:37.586 --> 00:06:41.044
Yes, you can go into town tomorrow
and pick out whatever you like.

116
00:06:41.156 --> 00:06:43.750
Not too expensive! Just joking, son!

117
00:06:44.226 --> 00:06:45.784
But we'll see you real soon, and

118
00:06:45.894 --> 00:06:47.555
uh, remember you have yourself a...

119
00:06:47.663 --> 00:06:49.392
Happy birthday!!

120
00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.271
It wasn't the president.

121
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.272
Happy birthday to you!

122
00:07:04.746 --> 00:07:07.874
Happy birthday to you!

123
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.944
Happy birthday dear Arthur!

124
00:07:13.322 --> 00:07:18.658
Happy birthday to you!

125
00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:21.588
You know what?

126
00:07:21.697 --> 00:07:23.130
You're the best Granny in the world!

127
00:07:23.232 --> 00:07:24.893
And you're the best grandson!

128
00:07:26.135 --> 00:07:27.193
Go on, blow them out!

129
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.368
Presents first?

130
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:30.401
Oh!

131
00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:32.598
Okay. This is from Alfred.

132
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.079
I never had a new one before!

133
00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:41.316
Thank you Alfred!

134
00:07:42.284 --> 00:07:44.718
No, ah! If you could wait
til you're outside to throw it,

135
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.809
I'd consider that a favor...

136
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:47.286
Oh, yeah, you're right.

137
00:07:47.823 --> 00:07:49.222
And this is from me.

138
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:54.358
It's beautiful!

139
00:08:02.738 --> 00:08:05.434
How did you manage to bake a cake?
I thought the oven was broken.

140
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:09.705
Mrs. Kerman from the hardware store
actually made it! Still like it?

141
00:08:09.811 --> 00:08:11.210
It's fantastic.

142
00:08:12.014 --> 00:08:13.777
Just too big for three.

143
00:08:14.216 --> 00:08:18.414
Don't be too hard on them, Arthur!
They try their best...

144
00:08:18.554 --> 00:08:20.954
I spend my whole year
in boarding school in England,

145
00:08:21.823 --> 00:08:25.782
when I come back for vacation,
they're not even here!

146
00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:30.992
Anyway I'm used to it now,
they're never here for my birthday.

147
00:08:34.036 --> 00:08:35.594
Wait! Make a wish.

148
00:08:36.538 --> 00:08:41.703
I wish that, for my next birthday,
Grandpa will be here to share it.

149
00:08:43.712 --> 00:08:47.512
Better blow them out quick,
you don't wanna eat a wax cake!

150
00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:54.778
Every night this magnificent
sunset was all ours.

151
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.621
It's precisely into this landscape
that your mother came into the world.

152
00:08:58.894 --> 00:09:01.920
While I was having the baby,
your grandfather was painting this.

153
00:09:03.565 --> 00:09:05.726
- Who are they?
- The Bogo-Matassalai.

154
00:09:05.834 --> 00:09:08.826
Your grandfather helped build
an irrigation ditch for them

155
00:09:08.937 --> 00:09:12.270
and in return they gave him
a big bag of rubies.

156
00:09:12.774 --> 00:09:13.240
Really?

157
00:09:13.342 --> 00:09:16.402
Really. Oh, I could tell you
stories all night long.

158
00:09:16.511 --> 00:09:17.535
Great! Tell me.

159
00:09:17.646 --> 00:09:19.443
No, not tonight,
Arthur, maybe tomorrow.

160
00:09:19.548 --> 00:09:21.539
- Come on
- No, I haven't even cleaned the kitchen.

161
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.344
Please, Granny.

162
00:09:22.451 --> 00:09:25.181
Just a little! It's my birthday!

163
00:09:27.356 --> 00:09:29.950
- Alright, just one minute.
- Ok.

164
00:09:30.792 --> 00:09:34.023
The Bogo-Matassalai were very, very tall.

165
00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:37.758
They say that nature always
balances itself with its opposite

166
00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:41.768
and for centuries they searched for them,
in order to find perfect harmony.

167
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.768
And did they find them?

168
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:46.398
Yes. It was another tribe
living right next to them

169
00:09:46.508 --> 00:09:48.703
and they had this particular trait

170
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.802
they were small as a tooth.

171
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:56.975
They called them the Minimoys!

172
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.445
Wow! Did they get along?

173
00:10:00.555 --> 00:10:04.491
Oh, wonderfully!
Soon they were inseparable!

174
00:10:04.593 --> 00:10:08.495
The one side very incredibly tall,
the other incredibly small.

175
00:10:08.597 --> 00:10:11.930
And only together could they
have a complete vision of the world.

176
00:10:12.034 --> 00:10:13.023
Who's this?

177
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:15.169
This is the Princess Selenia.

178
00:10:15.437 --> 00:10:17.405
Daughter of the king of the Minimoys.

179
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.939
She's beautiful!

180
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.872
I mean, this is incredible!

181
00:10:22.978 --> 00:10:25.412
Yes and the king himself
gave your grandfather

182
00:10:25.514 --> 00:10:27.982
the secret of how to
find him anytime he wanted!

183
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.377
That's what your grandfather said
every time he was a little drunk.

184
00:10:33.088 --> 00:10:34.851
I like the Minimoys, too.

185
00:10:36.692 --> 00:10:38.455
Now, to sleep!

186
00:10:40.729 --> 00:10:41.923
Sweet dreams.

187
00:11:01.116 --> 00:11:02.674
We miss you Archibald

188
00:11:03.618 --> 00:11:05.176
we really do...

189
00:11:33.281 --> 00:11:34.270
No!!!

190
00:11:40.956 --> 00:11:42.048
How you doing, kid?

191
00:11:44.726 --> 00:11:46.489
Wow! Wow! Ahh!

192
00:11:55.137 --> 00:11:56.263
Nice shot.

193
00:12:17.926 --> 00:12:19.826
Mr. Davido! You startled me!

194
00:12:19.928 --> 00:12:23.364
I'm so sorry!
Spring cleaning? Need a hand?

195
00:12:23.465 --> 00:12:24.193
No, thank you.

196
00:12:24.299 --> 00:12:25.266
What do you want this time?

197
00:12:25.367 --> 00:12:26.334
Here it is! Done!

198
00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:27.663
Signed, sealed and delivered.

199
00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:28.895
You didn't waste any time!

200
00:12:29.004 --> 00:12:31.199
I was churchgoing, really.
I was in church this morning.

201
00:12:31.306 --> 00:12:33.069
You were in church?
I've never seen you there.

202
00:12:33.175 --> 00:12:34.472
Oh, I usually sit in the back.

203
00:12:34.576 --> 00:12:35.668
Modesty really.

204
00:12:35.777 --> 00:12:36.766
You really should have been there.

205
00:12:36.878 --> 00:12:38.505
You would have seen the Mayor,
who confirmed the document

206
00:12:38.613 --> 00:12:41.047
which pronounces
the expiration of your ownership

207
00:12:41.149 --> 00:12:43.310
of this roperty for lack of payment.

208
00:12:43.418 --> 00:12:45.716
The President of the bank,
who transferred your debt to me.

209
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:47.982
And as amazing as it may seem,
you know who else was there?

210
00:12:48.089 --> 00:12:52.287
The Notary and the Chief of Police
who countersigned the order of eviction.

211
00:12:52.394 --> 00:12:54.794
So you see,
there is not a single signature missing

212
00:12:54.896 --> 00:12:58.059
and if your husband does not sign
this paper within the next 48 hours,

213
00:12:58.166 --> 00:13:01.465
I will be under the obligation to
evict you from this property

214
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.061
whether your laundry is dry or not!

215
00:13:04.172 --> 00:13:05.366
Oh!

216
00:13:05.907 --> 00:13:08.239
You should to
hang him up to dry as well!

217
00:13:09.077 --> 00:13:10.408
Are we gonna have to leave the house?

218
00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:12.112
I'm afraid so...

219
00:13:12.614 --> 00:13:15.174
I won't be able to hold off
that vulture Davido much longer.

220
00:13:15.283 --> 00:13:16.580
But what about the treasure?

221
00:13:16.685 --> 00:13:18.846
The rubies that
the Matassalais gave Grandpa?!

222
00:13:18.954 --> 00:13:21.582
Your grandpa hid them
somewhere out there in the yard.

223
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.590
I dug for weeks! And I...

224
00:13:23.692 --> 00:13:26.627
He hid them so well
I haven't been able to find them.

225
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.324
Where are you going?

226
00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:30.693
You think I'm gonna hang around

227
00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:32.528
twiddling my thumbs for forty eight hours?

228
00:13:32.634 --> 00:13:34.431
I'm gonna find the treasure!

229
00:13:36.538 --> 00:13:37.903
Just like his Grandpa!

230
00:13:51.686 --> 00:13:54.849
You should go and find my car rather
than sitting there watching me.

231
00:14:03.031 --> 00:14:03.861
Can I help you?

232
00:14:04.633 --> 00:14:06.396
Oh! Pardon me!

233
00:14:07.402 --> 00:14:10.337
You came by our house
once and left this.

234
00:14:10.438 --> 00:14:11.962
You said if we ever wanted to get rid

235
00:14:12.073 --> 00:14:14.007
of any furniture or knick knacks...

236
00:14:14.109 --> 00:14:14.507
Yes?

237
00:14:14.609 --> 00:14:17.169
Well, I... I, I brought this...

238
00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:19.338
It's from my private collection...

239
00:14:19.447 --> 00:14:21.972
I wondered if it was at all valuable.

240
00:14:23.552 --> 00:14:25.042
Aah...

241
00:14:25.153 --> 00:14:27.212
What is this? A carnival mask?

242
00:14:27.422 --> 00:14:29.652
No, this is an African mask.

243
00:14:29.758 --> 00:14:32.659
This is... This belonged to the chief
of the Bogo-Matassalai tribe.

244
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:34.626
- Two bucks.
- Two dollars?

245
00:14:34.729 --> 00:14:37.698
But this is... of inestimable value...

246
00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:39.391
Alright, alright, two fifty.
That's the best I can do!

247
00:14:39.501 --> 00:14:42.163
This kind of exotic object
just isn't selling any more.

248
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:46.400
People want practical, concrete,
modern stuff, you know.

249
00:14:49.611 --> 00:14:52.045
I can't believe you'd have hidden
the treasure in the yard

250
00:14:52.147 --> 00:14:56.447
without leaving some sort of clue, a note,
something to help us find it!

251
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:02.087
Malthazar...

252
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.055
The Evil... M.

253
00:15:09.731 --> 00:15:12.165
I hope I have the honour of
meeting you one day, princess!

254
00:15:13.368 --> 00:15:14.562
In the meantime...

255
00:15:15.804 --> 00:15:17.635
Permit me to steal a kiss.

256
00:15:20.842 --> 00:15:22.139
Jealous!

257
00:15:27.015 --> 00:15:28.039
I knew it!

258
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.541
"To get to the land of the Minimoys"

259
00:15:30.652 --> 00:15:32.779
"put your trust in Shakespeare."

260
00:15:33.154 --> 00:15:35.816
Shakespeare? What tribe's he from?

261
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.593
The house is here... South is that way.

262
00:15:46.167 --> 00:15:48.601
The tree! The elf! The moon!

263
00:15:48.703 --> 00:15:51.001
It's all there! Alfred! We found it!

264
00:15:51.106 --> 00:15:51.970
Yes!!

265
00:15:52.073 --> 00:15:53.472
Hang on there, young man!

266
00:15:53.575 --> 00:15:55.133
Arthur, how many times
do I have to tell you?

267
00:15:55.243 --> 00:15:56.938
I don't want you playing in this room.

268
00:15:57.245 --> 00:15:59.213
- Excuse me, please, go ahead!
- Thank you...

269
00:15:59.314 --> 00:16:01.305
- Granny?! Who are these guys?
- What?

270
00:16:01.416 --> 00:16:02.883
This gentleman is going to evaluate

271
00:16:02.984 --> 00:16:04.315
some of your grandpa's things.

272
00:16:04.419 --> 00:16:06.353
Granny?! You're not gonna sell
grandpa's things?!

273
00:16:06.454 --> 00:16:08.285
What? I'm afraid I don't
have any choice anymore!

274
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.254
Yes we do!

275
00:16:09.357 --> 00:16:11.484
Look! It's the map to get to the Minimoys!

276
00:16:11.593 --> 00:16:12.582
- They're here!
- What map?

277
00:16:12.694 --> 00:16:15.527
Grandpa brought them back from Africa
with him! If we can get to them,

278
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.154
I'm sure they can lead us to the treasure!

279
00:16:17.265 --> 00:16:19.028
Arthur you're a big boy now, right?

280
00:16:19.134 --> 00:16:20.726
You don't really believe
there are little elves

281
00:16:20.835 --> 00:16:22.268
running around the garden
just waiting for you

282
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.634
to visit so they can slap
a bag of rubies in your hand!

283
00:16:24.739 --> 00:16:25.899
Pardon me?

284
00:16:26.007 --> 00:16:27.497
Euh... Nothing... I...

285
00:16:27.609 --> 00:16:29.338
I was chatting with my grandson.

286
00:16:29.444 --> 00:16:30.968
If you have jewels, we are interested.

287
00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:33.673
Unfortunately, not a jewel on the horizon.

288
00:16:33.782 --> 00:16:35.147
Go to your room, now.

289
00:16:36.484 --> 00:16:38.509
"Some words may hide others" William. S.

290
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.247
"S" for Socrates?

291
00:16:40.355 --> 00:16:43.324
Shakespeare. William Shakespeare.

292
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:44.423
Not too far off!

293
00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:49.128
Yes. Better hurry and make your choice
before I change my mind.

294
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.357
- Come on let's go... Let's go!
- Granny...

295
00:16:51.466 --> 00:16:52.558
Three hundred dollars.

296
00:16:52.834 --> 00:16:55.359
It's not very much for
thirty years of memories!

297
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.529
A down payment! If I sell them well,
you'll have more.

298
00:16:57.639 --> 00:16:58.697
Thank you.

299
00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:01.108
Mrs. Suchot?

300
00:17:01.209 --> 00:17:01.732
Yes.

301
00:17:01.843 --> 00:17:04.038
Frederic De Saint-Clair. Process server.

302
00:17:04.145 --> 00:17:04.770
Bailiff.

303
00:17:05.547 --> 00:17:07.105
It seems I came at an opportune time.

304
00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:08.381
I have a claim for debt collection

305
00:17:08.483 --> 00:17:09.814
which concerns you,
for non-payment of services

306
00:17:09.918 --> 00:17:11.886
rendered by a certain Mr. Davido,

307
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.113
Ernest, for the amount of
two hundred fifty two dollars,

308
00:17:14.556 --> 00:17:16.114
now with the six percent
late penalty surcharge,

309
00:17:16.224 --> 00:17:17.384
and procedural fees added,

310
00:17:17.492 --> 00:17:20.950
that comes to a total of two hundred
ninety five dollars and five cents.

311
00:17:22.097 --> 00:17:23.155
May I?

312
00:17:29.204 --> 00:17:30.136
Here's your change.

313
00:17:31.639 --> 00:17:32.230
Hello?

314
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.864
Sweetie it's mom, is everything alright?

315
00:17:33.975 --> 00:17:35.499
Great!! We're cleaning up today!

316
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.238
It's amazing how much old stuff
just piles up around the place...

317
00:17:38.346 --> 00:17:40.644
But, thanks to Granny, we threw it all out!

318
00:17:40.749 --> 00:17:42.944
Arthur! Don't upset your parents!

319
00:17:43.318 --> 00:17:44.615
Did you hang up on your mother?

320
00:17:44.719 --> 00:17:46.084
Of course not! It hung up by itself

321
00:17:46.187 --> 00:17:47.484
Well, she'll call back in a second!

322
00:17:47.589 --> 00:17:49.716
Granny! They've cut the phone line!

323
00:17:49.824 --> 00:17:51.314
Don't you see what's happening?

324
00:17:51.426 --> 00:17:52.893
We've fallen into their trap,

325
00:17:52.994 --> 00:17:55.656
and it's closing in on us
a little bit more every minute!

326
00:17:55.764 --> 00:17:59.359
But as long as I live and breathe,
they're not gonna get this house!!!

327
00:18:00.101 --> 00:18:03.264
There you see? That's probably the repairman.

328
00:18:03.805 --> 00:18:04.328
Good evening ma'am!

329
00:18:04.439 --> 00:18:05.701
You came at just the right time!

330
00:18:05.807 --> 00:18:07.434
Our phone's just been cut off

331
00:18:07.542 --> 00:18:09.567
and I really think you
should warn people!

332
00:18:09.677 --> 00:18:11.611
I agree, ma'am,
but I'm not from the phone company,

333
00:18:11.713 --> 00:18:12.839
I'm from the electric company.

334
00:18:12.947 --> 00:18:13.777
And I came to tell you

335
00:18:13.882 --> 00:18:16.112
that you're gonna be
cut off soon for non payment.

336
00:18:21.422 --> 00:18:23.617
Some words may hide others...

337
00:18:23.825 --> 00:18:25.656
Grandpa, help me...

338
00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:27.961
When am I gonna get cut off?

339
00:18:29.564 --> 00:18:31.657
That's what I call a clear answer...

340
00:18:31.766 --> 00:18:33.393
Don't move, I'll get a candle.

341
00:18:39.941 --> 00:18:43.570
Some words may hide others...

342
00:18:43.945 --> 00:18:45.344
Of course!

343
00:18:45.814 --> 00:18:47.577
My dear Arthur.

344
00:18:47.682 --> 00:18:50.446
I was sure I could count
on you to find my riddle.

345
00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:53.276
You must be at least ten to
have become so clever.

346
00:18:53.388 --> 00:18:55.948
I, on the other hand,
have not been so clever,

347
00:18:56.057 --> 00:18:57.388
and if you are reading this,

348
00:18:58.059 --> 00:18:59.526
I am probably dead.

349
00:18:59.961 --> 00:19:04.022
Therefore, the heavy task of accomplishing
my mission now falls to you.

350
00:19:04.132 --> 00:19:06.657
- If you accept it, that is.
- I accept, Grandpa.

351
00:19:06.768 --> 00:19:08.895
I knew you would. Bravo.

352
00:19:09.003 --> 00:19:10.595
To get to the land of the Minimoys,

353
00:19:10.705 --> 00:19:14.300
you must know on which day
the next passage will fall.

354
00:19:14.676 --> 00:19:15.802
There's only one per year.

355
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.845
Take the universal calendar from my desk.

356
00:19:18.947 --> 00:19:22.474
The night of the tenth moon,
at precisely midnight,

357
00:19:22.584 --> 00:19:24.711
the moonlight-passage will open...

358
00:19:26.254 --> 00:19:30.691
If you follow my instructions,
you will have the world in your hands.

359
00:19:34.662 --> 00:19:36.129
That's today!

360
00:19:37.565 --> 00:19:39.430
Night brings good counsel, Arthur.

361
00:19:39.534 --> 00:19:40.501
We'll sleep on it...

362
00:19:40.802 --> 00:19:42.827
Tomorrow will bring a solution.

363
00:19:43.338 --> 00:19:44.771
- Good night, Granny.
- Goodnight.

364
00:19:49.677 --> 00:19:52.168
The world in my hands...
World in my hands...

365
00:19:53.781 --> 00:19:56.215
On the right side of the chimney,
there's a button.

366
00:19:56.317 --> 00:20:00.117
Turn it all the way to the right
and then turn it back to the left.

367
00:20:00.788 --> 00:20:02.551
Only twenty minutes before midnight.

368
00:20:04.259 --> 00:20:05.521
I've got to do something.

369
00:20:10.665 --> 00:20:13.634
As soon as you can, go to my office,
if the door is open.

370
00:20:15.603 --> 00:20:18.970
If it's locked, it's because
your grandma has been around.

371
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.638
You'll have to work it out by yourself.

372
00:20:53.074 --> 00:20:54.166
I thought you were in the shower!

373
00:20:54.275 --> 00:20:56.766
No, I was in the living room
looking for my sleeping drops...

374
00:20:56.878 --> 00:20:59.142
And if you don't get back
into bed this second

375
00:20:59.247 --> 00:21:01.272
I'm gonna make you
drink the whole bottle!

376
00:21:01.916 --> 00:21:02.940
Go!

377
00:21:04.686 --> 00:21:06.085
Go on! Go on!

378
00:21:15.363 --> 00:21:17.263
You know. I don't like to do this.

379
00:21:17.365 --> 00:21:18.730
But I'm gonna lock you in.

380
00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:20.596
I don't want you to do
anything stupid tonight.

381
00:21:20.702 --> 00:21:21.634
Ok.

382
00:21:21.736 --> 00:21:22.760
Ok...

383
00:22:14.522 --> 00:22:17.787
Alfred, what're you doing? Go to sleep.

384
00:22:18.626 --> 00:22:20.753
Is it the full moon or what?

385
00:22:22.563 --> 00:22:23.791
Thank you, Alfred.

386
00:22:35.943 --> 00:22:36.967
Aaaah!

387
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.374
Granny!?

388
00:23:01.702 --> 00:23:03.169
"Always keeps this key with you."

389
00:23:08.643 --> 00:23:11.009
The garden, the tree, the telescope...

390
00:23:11.946 --> 00:23:13.277
Oh my god!

391
00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.448
I need more light!

392
00:23:25.993 --> 00:23:27.551
I've seen Granny do this a hundred times.

393
00:23:33.534 --> 00:23:34.933
Oh, yeah, the brake...

394
00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:42.706
Ah! Ah!

395
00:23:45.413 --> 00:23:49.975
Oh! No! No!!!

396
00:23:55.256 --> 00:23:56.382
Perfect!

397
00:24:01.329 --> 00:24:02.296
Sorry, old man!

398
00:24:28.256 --> 00:24:29.587
Now for the dolls.

399
00:24:50.878 --> 00:24:52.140
Alfred!

400
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:04.417
Arthur?

401
00:25:04.725 --> 00:25:06.522
Uh, yeah.

402
00:25:07.562 --> 00:25:09.928
- Follow me!
- Oh, okay...

403
00:25:17.905 --> 00:25:18.963
Hi.

404
00:25:48.836 --> 00:25:49.825
Time to go.

405
00:25:49.937 --> 00:25:51.268
You're not coming?

406
00:25:52.807 --> 00:25:54.399
Only one can pass through

407
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:58.174
and you seem to us to be
the best choice to combat Evil M...

408
00:25:58.379 --> 00:25:59.505
MALTHAZAR?

409
00:26:00.581 --> 00:26:02.310
Never, never speak that name.

410
00:26:02.416 --> 00:26:04.680
- It brings bad luck.
- Ok, ok...

411
00:26:04.785 --> 00:26:06.844
Your grandfather went off to defeat him

412
00:26:06.954 --> 00:26:09.718
and now it's up to you to continue his fight.

413
00:26:10.324 --> 00:26:11.313
Thanks for the honor, but...

414
00:26:11.425 --> 00:26:13.950
I think it might be better
if I leave my place to one of you...

415
00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:16.427
I mean, you're so much bigger
and stronger than me...

416
00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.691
Your heart is the strongest of weapons.

417
00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:19.993
Ok.

418
00:26:22.303 --> 00:26:28.674
First ring, for the body
three times... to the right.

419
00:26:30.111 --> 00:26:36.607
The second ring, for the mind
three times... to... the left.

420
00:26:36.884 --> 00:26:37.942
And the third ring...

421
00:26:42.623 --> 00:26:44.215
One whole turn...

422
00:26:46.494 --> 00:26:47.654
for the soul.

423
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.824
There! The door is open!

424
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:55.093
You can introduce yourself!

425
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:56.236
Introduce myself?

426
00:26:56.337 --> 00:26:59.363
Yes, and try to be convincing
because you only have five minutes.

427
00:26:59.507 --> 00:27:03.671
Alright! Be convincing! Ok! Ok!

428
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:13.711
Euh...

429
00:27:13.821 --> 00:27:14.913
There's a...

430
00:27:15.956 --> 00:27:17.218
With...

431
00:27:20.961 --> 00:27:21.928
Archibald?

432
00:27:22.363 --> 00:27:23.330
No, no... No.

433
00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:24.762
Introduce yourself!

434
00:27:25.499 --> 00:27:28.491
I'm his grandson... My name is Arthur...

435
00:27:28.602 --> 00:27:29.626
And you are...

436
00:27:29.737 --> 00:27:31.898
Saimono Matrodoy de Betameche.

437
00:27:32.006 --> 00:27:32.700
Right...

438
00:27:32.807 --> 00:27:34.069
But you can call me Beta...

439
00:27:34.175 --> 00:27:36.200
Pleased to meet you, Beta.

440
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.141
I hope you have a good reason
for using the beam like that,

441
00:27:38.245 --> 00:27:40.042
because the Council
has strictly forbidden it...

442
00:27:40.247 --> 00:27:41.475
Go on! Go on!

443
00:27:42.183 --> 00:27:44.242
This is a matter of extreme urgency!!

444
00:27:44.352 --> 00:27:46.513
In just two days' time,
the garden will be destroyed!

445
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.678
What are you talking about, young man?!

446
00:27:47.788 --> 00:27:49.255
Are you a practical joker,
like your grandfather?

447
00:27:49.357 --> 00:27:51.257
This is no joke, Mister Betameche...

448
00:27:51.359 --> 00:27:54.726
A building contractor wants to flatten
the land and build apartment blocks!!

449
00:27:54.829 --> 00:27:55.488
Ah!

450
00:27:55.596 --> 00:27:56.494
What are apartment blocks?

451
00:27:56.597 --> 00:28:00.260
Enormous houses built from concrete
that will cover up all the gardens

452
00:28:00.368 --> 00:28:02.734
and stop the flowers from growing!

453
00:28:02.837 --> 00:28:03.826
But that's awful!!

454
00:28:03.938 --> 00:28:06.099
The only way to prevent this is
for me to find the treasure

455
00:28:06.207 --> 00:28:08.072
that my grandfather
has hidden somewhere!

456
00:28:08.175 --> 00:28:11.838
Then I'll be able to pay off the contractor
and none of this will happen!

457
00:28:11.946 --> 00:28:13.004
Well, that's a really good idea!

458
00:28:13.114 --> 00:28:14.877
All's well that ends well! See ya!

459
00:28:14.982 --> 00:28:16.847
No, no! To do that...

460
00:28:16.951 --> 00:28:18.213
I need to pass into your world...

461
00:28:18.319 --> 00:28:19.911
So I can start looking for the treasure!

462
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:20.611
Heuh?!

463
00:28:20.721 --> 00:28:21.517
That's not possible!

464
00:28:21.622 --> 00:28:22.987
You can't make a journey just like that...

465
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.250
The council must first be assembled,

466
00:28:24.358 --> 00:28:25.757
then you must explain your problem to them,

467
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:26.554
they will then deliberate and...

468
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.255
And in two days' time the land
will be flattened and you'll all be dead!

469
00:28:30.631 --> 00:28:31.962
This is an extreme emergency.

470
00:28:32.066 --> 00:28:33.499
Yes and we have to act now

471
00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:36.126
because the future of
your people is in your hands!

472
00:28:36.337 --> 00:28:38.066
Yes, you're right in my hands.

473
00:28:38.172 --> 00:28:39.400
This calls for action!

474
00:28:40.107 --> 00:28:42.007
Ferryman! Ferryman! Wake-up,
it's an emergency!

475
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:43.699
You did well!

476
00:28:43.811 --> 00:28:45.642
I hope it will be
enough to convince him!

477
00:28:49.049 --> 00:28:51.142
Betameche?! You little good-for-nothing!

478
00:28:51.252 --> 00:28:52.276
Don't you have anything better to do

479
00:28:52.386 --> 00:28:54.183
than go around waking up honest people?

480
00:28:54.288 --> 00:28:55.778
But it's the light! It has been reactivated!

481
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.586
What again!? Why does everyone
want to suddenly travel?!

482
00:28:58.692 --> 00:28:59.716
The last one was three years ago...

483
00:28:59.827 --> 00:29:01.988
Exactly, that's what I mean,
I was just starting to nod off...

484
00:29:02.096 --> 00:29:03.427
Hurry up, the boy needs to see the King!

485
00:29:03.531 --> 00:29:04.088
The King! The King!

486
00:29:04.198 --> 00:29:05.460
First, the moon!

487
00:29:05.566 --> 00:29:07.932
Is it full now? Perfect, perfect!

488
00:29:08.035 --> 00:29:09.502
And now for the rings...

489
00:29:10.237 --> 00:29:10.965
So...

490
00:29:11.071 --> 00:29:13.039
three turns to the right for the body...

491
00:29:15.576 --> 00:29:18.067
Three turns to the left for the spirit.

492
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.314
And now, one whole turn for the soul.

493
00:29:28.656 --> 00:29:30.021
What's happening to me?!

494
00:29:30.624 --> 00:29:33.218
You are going to join our brothers,
the Minimoys!

495
00:29:33.427 --> 00:29:36.555
- They will lead you to the Seven Kingdoms.
- Help! Stop!

496
00:29:36.664 --> 00:29:38.325
- You only have thirty-six hours!
- Granny!

497
00:29:38.432 --> 00:29:39.990
At noon on the day after tomorrow,

498
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.092
the gateway will
close again for 1000 days!

499
00:29:43.737 --> 00:29:46.672
Thirty six hours... I'll do my best!

500
00:29:47.641 --> 00:29:48.835
Good luck, Arthur.

501
00:30:01.522 --> 00:30:03.319
The key! You have the key!

502
00:30:03.424 --> 00:30:05.892
The key? Yeah, I have the key!

503
00:30:08.863 --> 00:30:10.626
Ok. Now go over to the lock.

504
00:30:10.731 --> 00:30:11.663
The lock?

505
00:30:12.933 --> 00:30:13.922
That has to be it.

506
00:30:14.602 --> 00:30:16.729
Good! Good! Now turn the key.

507
00:30:21.108 --> 00:30:22.336
I'm gonna die!!

508
00:30:22.443 --> 00:30:23.501
Yes!

509
00:30:24.178 --> 00:30:28.842
No, no, no, no, nooo! Aaaaah!

510
00:30:38.125 --> 00:30:39.854
Welcome to the Land of the Minimoys!

511
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.121
It's not funny! You really scared me!

512
00:30:42.229 --> 00:30:43.560
I thought I was going to die in that...

513
00:30:43.664 --> 00:30:44.926
Oh...

514
00:30:46.934 --> 00:30:48.731
- That's incredible!
- What's incredible?

515
00:30:48.836 --> 00:30:51.361
I dunno, just look at my clothes,
they've changed!

516
00:30:51.472 --> 00:30:52.564
You can admire yourself later.

517
00:30:52.673 --> 00:30:53.640
The council's waiting for you...

518
00:30:53.741 --> 00:30:55.436
Come on, follow me!

519
00:30:57.311 --> 00:30:59.643
I think I'd like to take a little nap...

520
00:31:13.727 --> 00:31:14.386
How far've they got?!

521
00:31:14.495 --> 00:31:16.656
You're joking, they've only just started.

522
00:31:34.148 --> 00:31:36.378
Princess Selenia!

523
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:45.015
My little girl...

524
00:31:45.125 --> 00:31:46.217
Father!

525
00:31:46.794 --> 00:31:47.783
Sorry.

526
00:31:47.962 --> 00:31:51.659
Princess Selenia, may the spirits
of the Ancients guide you.

527
00:31:55.569 --> 00:31:57.764
- Papa!!!
- Yes?

528
00:31:58.272 --> 00:31:58.897
Papa!

529
00:31:59.006 --> 00:32:00.598
- Where are you?
- I'm over here!

530
00:32:00.708 --> 00:32:01.834
My son!

531
00:32:01.942 --> 00:32:03.409
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

532
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.410
Couldn't you have waited ten seconds
before playing the clown?!

533
00:32:05.512 --> 00:32:06.638
I'm on a mission of great importance!

534
00:32:06.747 --> 00:32:07.213
Aah??

535
00:32:07.314 --> 00:32:09.145
Because my mission isn't of
great importance, is that it?

536
00:32:09.249 --> 00:32:10.876
You're far too arrogant to
be able to free the sword!

537
00:32:10.985 --> 00:32:11.610
You know you are!

538
00:32:11.719 --> 00:32:14.153
Enough! Stop bickering, the two of you!

539
00:32:14.254 --> 00:32:14.879
Betameche!

540
00:32:14.989 --> 00:32:17.651
I hope you have good reason for
daring to disrupt this important ceremony.

541
00:32:17.758 --> 00:32:20.750
I do father! The Upperlands Light Beam
was activated today.

542
00:32:22.262 --> 00:32:23.627
Who would dare do this?

543
00:32:23.731 --> 00:32:24.561
His name is Arthur.

544
00:32:24.665 --> 00:32:25.996
He is the grandson of Archibald

545
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.034
and he says a great misfortune
is about to befall us...

546
00:32:28.135 --> 00:32:29.796
Our great misfortune has a name

547
00:32:29.903 --> 00:32:30.733
The Evil M.

548
00:32:30.838 --> 00:32:32.669
And we have no need of
this Arthur person.

549
00:32:32.773 --> 00:32:34.070
As the Princess of royal blood,

550
00:32:34.174 --> 00:32:37.075
the task of protecting
our People falls to me.

551
00:32:38.012 --> 00:32:39.104
Yes, but...

552
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.940
Ok...

553
00:32:48.455 --> 00:32:49.615
Will she make it?

554
00:32:50.457 --> 00:32:52.482
It's moving! I have it, I have it!

555
00:32:52.593 --> 00:32:53.855
I feel it!

556
00:32:55.062 --> 00:32:56.495
She's never gonna make it.

557
00:33:03.437 --> 00:33:05.302
See, told you so. Way too arrogant.

558
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.169
In view of the circumstances,

559
00:33:08.275 --> 00:33:10.072
the Council agrees to hear this young man.

560
00:33:17.584 --> 00:33:19.074
Where does he come from?

561
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.388
Oh! He's so cute!

562
00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:24.222
Cute huh?

563
00:33:24.324 --> 00:33:25.450
Ordinary...

564
00:33:27.361 --> 00:33:29.295
My humble respects, Princess Selenia.

565
00:33:29.396 --> 00:33:31.626
- Who told him my name?
- My humble respects, Princess Selenia.

566
00:33:31.732 --> 00:33:34.098
I'm sure it was you, you're only one
that knows this Arthur.

567
00:33:34.201 --> 00:33:35.668
You can't keep a secret

568
00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:38.260
My humble respects, your Majesty.

569
00:33:38.939 --> 00:33:39.564
Um...

570
00:33:39.673 --> 00:33:40.935
Yes... My respects...

571
00:33:41.041 --> 00:33:43.202
Oh, Arthur, I am delighted to meet you...

572
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.505
I was a good friend of
your grandfather Archibald!

573
00:33:45.612 --> 00:33:48.604
Miro, leave him alone! Well,
young man, we're all ears!

574
00:33:48.716 --> 00:33:49.375
It's like this...

575
00:33:49.483 --> 00:33:51.178
In just under two days
some men are going to come

576
00:33:51.285 --> 00:33:53.480
and destroy my house,
my garden, my world.

577
00:33:53.587 --> 00:33:54.281
And your world.

578
00:33:54.388 --> 00:33:56.083
And you, all two
and a half millimeters of you,

579
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:57.350
you've come to save us, is that it?

580
00:33:57.458 --> 00:33:58.948
The only way to stop
these men is to pay them off!

581
00:33:59.059 --> 00:34:01.425
This is why my grandfather
came to you three years ago.

582
00:34:01.528 --> 00:34:03.120
He was looking for a treasure and...

583
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:04.959
I've come to complete his mission.

584
00:34:05.065 --> 00:34:07.295
Your grandfather was a remarkable man...

585
00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:09.062
He taught us so many things!

586
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:12.400
He was the one who showed Miro
how to harness image and light.

587
00:34:12.706 --> 00:34:15.937
Then one day he left,
in search of this famous treasure.

588
00:34:16.043 --> 00:34:17.908
And after wandering through the seven lands

589
00:34:18.011 --> 00:34:21.071
which make up our world,
he finally found it...

590
00:34:21.181 --> 00:34:23.911
Deep in the Forbidden Lands,
in the heart of the city of Necropolis,

591
00:34:24.017 --> 00:34:28.386
where he reigns supreme... The Evil M.

592
00:34:28.722 --> 00:34:32.715
And unfortunately, no one ever returns
from the Forbidden Lands...

593
00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.322
So...

594
00:34:36.563 --> 00:34:38.190
Look out!!! To the central gate!!

595
00:34:44.738 --> 00:34:47.002
It's Gondolo,
the Juggler of the Great River...

596
00:34:47.508 --> 00:34:49.840
That's incredible, we thought he was
lost forever in the Forbidden Lands...

597
00:34:51.278 --> 00:34:52.370
Stop!!

598
00:34:53.614 --> 00:34:54.444
What's wrong, Arthur?

599
00:34:54.548 --> 00:34:57.540
Sire, look over there,
it looks as if a piece is peeling off.

600
00:34:57.651 --> 00:34:58.743
I think it's a trap.

601
00:34:58.886 --> 00:34:59.875
That's a painted canvas,

602
00:34:59.987 --> 00:35:02.922
my grandfather used to do this in Africa
to protect himself from wild animals...

603
00:35:03.023 --> 00:35:03.990
Well, we're not wild animals

604
00:35:04.091 --> 00:35:06.252
and we're not going to leave
this unhappy creature to die...

605
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.328
Here, make yourself useful!

606
00:35:09.897 --> 00:35:13.094
Oh my god! Gondolo...

607
00:35:14.034 --> 00:35:15.262
Oh...

608
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:17.766
Selenia!

609
00:35:17.871 --> 00:35:19.463
Yes, take it easy, Gondolo.

610
00:35:19.573 --> 00:35:21.541
It's a... trap!

611
00:35:28.916 --> 00:35:29.940
Oh!

612
00:35:32.786 --> 00:35:34.048
Oh my god!

613
00:35:35.923 --> 00:35:37.288
Mosquitos!

614
00:35:37.958 --> 00:35:38.549
Arthur!

615
00:35:38.659 --> 00:35:39.921
Close! Close the gate!!

616
00:35:40.627 --> 00:35:41.651
Charge!!!

617
00:35:57.778 --> 00:35:58.938
Go get them!

618
00:36:01.915 --> 00:36:02.882
Come on!

619
00:36:10.524 --> 00:36:11.456
Ready to fire!

620
00:36:16.897 --> 00:36:17.829
Watch out!

621
00:36:19.132 --> 00:36:20.759
Follow me to the palace!

622
00:36:21.501 --> 00:36:23.560
- Hurry, father!
- Yes, yes, I'm coming.

623
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.728
Ohh!

624
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:32.403
Oh, I am sorry, I'm so clumsy...

625
00:36:37.784 --> 00:36:38.546
Perfect timing...

626
00:36:38.652 --> 00:36:40.176
I rather fancied
stretching my legs a little...

627
00:36:40.287 --> 00:36:41.777
Father! Go and take cover, quickly!

628
00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:44.153
Out of the question!
It's a king's duty to face his destiny

629
00:36:44.258 --> 00:36:47.022
and if only one person is left standing,
I will be that person.

630
00:36:51.465 --> 00:36:52.159
Art...

631
00:36:52.799 --> 00:36:54.426
- We have to go on fighting!
- Sure, but with what?!

632
00:36:54.534 --> 00:36:56.161
Take my weapon. I'll find another one!

633
00:37:02.042 --> 00:37:03.270
This is not working.

634
00:37:07.814 --> 00:37:10.339
Gentlemen, it's time to face up to reality.

635
00:37:12.786 --> 00:37:14.048
Watch out the walls are booby trapped

636
00:37:14.154 --> 00:37:16.315
fly close to the roof it's much safer...

637
00:37:16.623 --> 00:37:17.783
I couldn't agree with you more...

638
00:37:18.558 --> 00:37:19.115
Come on, my lovebirds!

639
00:37:19.226 --> 00:37:20.921
This is your chance to prove
you really love each other...

640
00:37:21.028 --> 00:37:21.858
Here you go...

641
00:37:22.195 --> 00:37:24.425
Okay, we'll let them have one final kiss.

642
00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:27.566
Okay, that's enough now!

643
00:37:30.203 --> 00:37:32.967
When I blow my whistle, release your Romeo
so he can get back to his Juliet.

644
00:37:33.073 --> 00:37:34.040
Ok!

645
00:37:37.277 --> 00:37:38.335
Let's go!

646
00:37:48.488 --> 00:37:49.546
Oh no!

647
00:37:54.995 --> 00:37:55.825
Hi!

648
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.764
You wanna play!

649
00:38:06.873 --> 00:38:08.238
Okay, here we go...

650
00:38:13.914 --> 00:38:14.881
Come on!

651
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:19.178
Right, this can't be more complicated
than driving a car!

652
00:38:24.524 --> 00:38:26.492
Beta! Look out!

653
00:38:27.828 --> 00:38:30.422
Arthur, I'll never forget you!

654
00:38:45.312 --> 00:38:48.907
No, you fool!! No, it's not feeding time.!

655
00:38:50.984 --> 00:38:52.781
No... Not the gap!!

656
00:38:52.986 --> 00:38:54.248
Not the gap!!

657
00:38:54.888 --> 00:38:55.820
Oh!

658
00:39:11.171 --> 00:39:12.763
Ok, here we go again...!

659
00:39:15.208 --> 00:39:16.971
That's it, I've got it!! Ouuah!

660
00:39:17.077 --> 00:39:18.408
And one mosquito down!!

661
00:39:25.886 --> 00:39:27.877
Yeah that's better... Now let's go for it!

662
00:39:28.088 --> 00:39:30.079
How brave he is, how heroic!

663
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.181
It's amazing how much he's just like me!

664
00:39:32.292 --> 00:39:33.224
He'd make a good partner!

665
00:39:33.326 --> 00:39:34.793
Father, I'm old enough to
look after myself now...

666
00:39:34.895 --> 00:39:36.362
Forget it... Forget it...

667
00:39:38.265 --> 00:39:40.290
Oh! So who's next in line?

668
00:39:46.573 --> 00:39:48.598
- Oh no!
- Oh yes!

669
00:39:48.875 --> 00:39:49.603
Betameche!!

670
00:39:49.709 --> 00:39:50.641
Arthur?!

671
00:39:50.744 --> 00:39:51.642
Do something!!!

672
00:39:51.745 --> 00:39:53.440
Hang on, Arthur, I'm coming!

673
00:40:04.724 --> 00:40:06.248
What a gift he is!!

674
00:40:09.129 --> 00:40:11.393
Come to think of it,
he does remind me of you.

675
00:40:12.666 --> 00:40:13.997
You ok? Nothing broken?!

676
00:40:14.101 --> 00:40:16.592
I'm not sure,
I can't feel anything on my butt!!

677
00:40:17.104 --> 00:40:17.900
Just one question...

678
00:40:18.004 --> 00:40:19.096
Where did you learn to fly like that!

679
00:40:19.206 --> 00:40:20.036
Umm...

680
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.402
Driving with my grandfather.

681
00:40:21.508 --> 00:40:22.839
Oh, that makes sense.

682
00:40:24.945 --> 00:40:28.711
Well let's rise to the occasion.

683
00:40:29.049 --> 00:40:30.380
All's well that ends well

684
00:40:33.487 --> 00:40:37.514
Mogoth!
Let's show them what we're made of!

685
00:40:42.229 --> 00:40:43.992
Selenia... The Master wishes to see you.

686
00:40:44.097 --> 00:40:45.189
Follow us and no harm will come to you!

687
00:40:45.298 --> 00:40:45.992
Come and get me!

688
00:40:46.099 --> 00:40:47.123
Right, go on, grab her!

689
00:40:47.234 --> 00:40:47.757
Why me?

690
00:40:47.868 --> 00:40:48.493
Well, who else?

691
00:40:48.602 --> 00:40:49.296
Well, you for example!

692
00:40:49.402 --> 00:40:50.130
Me? Why me?

693
00:40:50.237 --> 00:40:51.898
Four of you attacking one woman!

694
00:40:52.005 --> 00:40:53.302
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?!

695
00:40:53.406 --> 00:40:53.838
No!!

696
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:54.929
Pick on someone your own size!

697
00:40:55.041 --> 00:40:56.508
With pleasure... With pleasure!

698
00:40:56.776 --> 00:40:57.800
Long live the king!

699
00:40:57.911 --> 00:40:59.640
Oh, my daughter!

700
00:41:08.755 --> 00:41:11.349
My child,
I must do something! Cover me!

701
00:41:12.359 --> 00:41:13.451
Thank you.

702
00:41:19.799 --> 00:41:21.426
The sword of power.

703
00:41:26.206 --> 00:41:27.434
It's a Miracle!

704
00:41:30.043 --> 00:41:31.533
Ok, that's enough now.

705
00:41:31.645 --> 00:41:33.704
Get on your knees and
beg the Princess for forgiveness!!

706
00:41:44.524 --> 00:41:47.254
I said, on your knees!!
And beg the Princess!

707
00:41:51.631 --> 00:41:53.098
Forgive us, Princess Selenia.

708
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.292
I don't think we heard that.

709
00:41:55.235 --> 00:41:58.636
Our humblest apologies, Princess Selenia.

710
00:41:59.005 --> 00:42:00.267
I'll think about it.

711
00:42:01.908 --> 00:42:04.274
That's my daughter,
just like her mother...

712
00:42:04.544 --> 00:42:05.943
You fought like a prince!

713
00:42:06.046 --> 00:42:06.637
Thanks...

714
00:42:06.746 --> 00:42:08.873
This sword seems so light,
it all seems so easy!

715
00:42:08.982 --> 00:42:09.971
Of course! It's a magic sword.

716
00:42:10.083 --> 00:42:11.277
It's been embedded in that rock for years

717
00:42:11.384 --> 00:42:13.011
and you're the one who released it...

718
00:42:13.119 --> 00:42:15.713
- Really?!
- Oh yes, my friend... You're a hero now.

719
00:42:15.989 --> 00:42:17.752
Arthur the hero!

720
00:42:18.124 --> 00:42:19.716
Arthur the hero!

721
00:42:20.293 --> 00:42:22.488
Arthur the hero!

722
00:42:22.929 --> 00:42:24.829
Long live Arthur the hero!

723
00:42:24.931 --> 00:42:28.059
Long live Arthur the hero!

724
00:42:28.635 --> 00:42:31.627
Long live Arthur the hero!

725
00:42:35.242 --> 00:42:37.107
Father! Now that the sword
has been freed from the stone,

726
00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.199
we must act fast.

727
00:42:38.311 --> 00:42:40.176
I would like your permission
to continue my mission.

728
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.544
Unfortunately, I have to
agree with you, my child,

729
00:42:42.649 --> 00:42:44.514
but I must insist on one condition...

730
00:42:44.618 --> 00:42:45.585
What condition is that?

731
00:42:45.685 --> 00:42:48.620
Arthur is brave and his heart is pure...

732
00:42:48.722 --> 00:42:49.586
He will go with you.

733
00:42:49.689 --> 00:42:51.554
If that is what you wish, father...

734
00:42:52.659 --> 00:42:53.887
Well done Arthur.

735
00:42:55.195 --> 00:42:57.129
I know you are going to
make a fine team!

736
00:43:16.916 --> 00:43:18.042
The way is clear

737
00:43:18.151 --> 00:43:19.311
Are you sure that you
haven't forgotten anything?

738
00:43:19.419 --> 00:43:20.784
I'm sure, go ahead... Let go...

739
00:43:21.121 --> 00:43:21.985
Oh, oh, oh, ah!

740
00:43:22.188 --> 00:43:24.088
Father, do we really have to
take Betameche with us?

741
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:26.590
Even if your brother is still young,
one day he will be...

742
00:43:26.693 --> 00:43:30.185
Arthur, if you should encounter
a small mole wearing glasses

743
00:43:30.297 --> 00:43:32.822
who answers to the name
of Mino on your travels...

744
00:43:32.932 --> 00:43:33.694
He is my son...

745
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.064
He's been missing for
some three months now...

746
00:43:36.436 --> 00:43:37.562
You can count on me.

747
00:43:38.004 --> 00:43:40.097
- Thank you, Arthur!
- Alright, let's get going.

748
00:43:40.206 --> 00:43:41.173
Hey hero, let's go.

749
00:43:41.274 --> 00:43:42.673
Hey! Wait for me...

750
00:43:44.878 --> 00:43:46.470
You could at least wait for me!

751
00:43:47.747 --> 00:43:48.577
Oh...

752
00:43:48.815 --> 00:43:51.443
I do hope
they won't fall into any traps.

753
00:44:02.095 --> 00:44:04.359
Locuteur I slept like a rock

754
00:44:12.072 --> 00:44:14.063
Arthur, time to get up.

755
00:44:31.758 --> 00:44:34.249
Selenia, slow down a bit, can't you?

756
00:44:34.361 --> 00:44:36.625
No way! It's your fault for
loading yourself up like a gamallus!

757
00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:39.164
I just packed a little bit of everything,
you know, just in case...

758
00:44:39.466 --> 00:44:41.730
- What's a gamallus?
- It's like a pachymollet, only much

759
00:44:41.835 --> 00:44:43.826
- And what does a pachymollet look like?
- Like that!

760
00:44:46.673 --> 00:44:47.867
Any chance you
got something in your bag

761
00:44:47.974 --> 00:44:48.998
for dealing with pachymollets?

762
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:51.100
Don't worry! I've got
my 300 function pocket knife here...

763
00:44:51.211 --> 00:44:53.577
Double knife, multicrab clips,
soap bubbles, music box

764
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.341
and for when things get really hot... a fan!

765
00:44:55.448 --> 00:44:57.109
Hey, that's pretty handy alright!

766
00:44:57.217 --> 00:44:58.184
And then you've got
all your classic functions

767
00:44:58.284 --> 00:45:01.913
like your tulipan, matchet,
sunjink, whistler, gullybar...

768
00:45:02.021 --> 00:45:03.420
Nothing in there to cut off
tongue by any chance?

769
00:45:03.523 --> 00:45:05.491
No, but that's you specialty, isn't it?

770
00:45:06.926 --> 00:45:07.824
Stay right where you are!!

771
00:45:10.163 --> 00:45:11.494
Run on my signal...

772
00:45:14.267 --> 00:45:14.824
Now!

773
00:45:20.907 --> 00:45:21.931
Here we are.

774
00:45:29.482 --> 00:45:30.449
Anybody home?

775
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:31.949
Not many people come through this way...

776
00:45:32.051 --> 00:45:33.916
Once you've tried it, you'll understand why!

777
00:45:34.854 --> 00:45:35.946
Anybody home?

778
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.581
Oh, oh!

779
00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:38.452
No! I... I'm sorry!

780
00:45:38.558 --> 00:45:39.650
I mistook you for a bell.

781
00:45:39.759 --> 00:45:40.191
Um...

782
00:45:40.293 --> 00:45:43.626
No, I mean, I didn't realize
you were actually... alive!

783
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:45.459
Hold on, ma que fa, stupido!

784
00:45:45.565 --> 00:45:46.532
What do you think
your're doing knocking out

785
00:45:46.633 --> 00:45:48.260
all o' my customers like that?

786
00:45:48.368 --> 00:45:49.858
It's not as if I got so many to start with.

787
00:45:49.969 --> 00:45:51.493
Hello. I am Princess Selenia.

788
00:45:51.604 --> 00:45:53.834
I know that and
that is your stupido brother!

789
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:54.804
And who's the third comedian

790
00:45:54.908 --> 00:45:56.808
who comes around
knocking out all the customers?

791
00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:57.968
My name's Arthur!

792
00:45:58.077 --> 00:45:59.476
And I'm looking for my grandfather!

793
00:45:59.579 --> 00:46:01.843
I transported a grandfather
a few years ago...

794
00:46:01.948 --> 00:46:02.778
An old eccentricmadman

795
00:46:02.882 --> 00:46:05.146
who absolutely insisted
on being transported deep

796
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:09.210
inside Seides territory, to NECROPOLIS...

797
00:46:09.456 --> 00:46:10.684
That's him! That's my grandfather!

798
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:12.314
And that's exactly where we wanna go!

799
00:46:12.425 --> 00:46:13.414
Sold out!

800
00:46:14.661 --> 00:46:17.596
Necropolis, sure,
why not the moon as well...

801
00:46:23.236 --> 00:46:24.225
We didn't ask you for the moon,

802
00:46:24.337 --> 00:46:27.738
we asked for three tickets to Necropolis,
is that clear enough?

803
00:46:36.316 --> 00:46:38.216
Arthur!!!

804
00:46:40.653 --> 00:46:41.881
Arthur?!

805
00:46:41.988 --> 00:46:44.354
You break my door to steal the key?!

806
00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:46.190
Answer me Arthur!

807
00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.188
Arthur!

808
00:46:56.169 --> 00:46:57.033
Oh! What a job!
Right this way.

809
00:46:57.136 --> 00:46:58.865
Come on! Keep moving where way on.

810
00:46:58.972 --> 00:47:02.032
Yes! Let's to leave! Let's go down the line.

811
00:47:04.277 --> 00:47:04.868
Hey!

812
00:47:04.978 --> 00:47:08.539
Fasten your safety belts, please...

813
00:47:08.648 --> 00:47:10.206
Arrivederci!

814
00:47:11.117 --> 00:47:12.277
Arthur?!!

815
00:47:13.353 --> 00:47:16.015
Arthur?!!

816
00:47:18.725 --> 00:47:19.692
The car...

817
00:47:20.627 --> 00:47:22.151
What's the car doing there?

818
00:47:24.297 --> 00:47:26.128
Oh! Boy! Here we go!

819
00:47:28.067 --> 00:47:29.227
Ah, here it is!

820
00:47:32.539 --> 00:47:33.471
Oh, wow...

821
00:47:33.573 --> 00:47:34.403
That's cool...

822
00:47:34.507 --> 00:47:36.441
I got another one just like it in pink,
wanna see it?

823
00:47:36.543 --> 00:47:38.204
Beta, we've got enough light already...

824
00:47:40.613 --> 00:47:41.545
Arthur...

825
00:47:41.648 --> 00:47:43.275
Where exactly are we heading?

826
00:47:43.383 --> 00:47:44.941
We are here and we're going here!

827
00:47:45.051 --> 00:47:46.518
Oh my gosh, I know where that is.

828
00:47:46.619 --> 00:47:47.779
That's right under the water tank.

829
00:47:47.887 --> 00:47:50.856
A giant water tank in the hands of
that unspeakable piece of.

830
00:47:50.957 --> 00:47:52.083
Now I'm starting to understand...

831
00:47:52.191 --> 00:47:52.953
Who are you talking about?

832
00:47:53.059 --> 00:47:54.754
The most evil of evil...

833
00:47:54.861 --> 00:47:56.726
Oh! Malthazar.

834
00:48:02.035 --> 00:48:03.093
Holy humpbacked gamallus!!

835
00:48:03.202 --> 00:48:04.863
Didn't anyone ever teach you
to hold your tongue?!

836
00:48:04.971 --> 00:48:06.199
I... I'm really sorry!

837
00:48:06.639 --> 00:48:08.937
Arthur?!

838
00:48:09.042 --> 00:48:09.906
Granny?

839
00:48:12.879 --> 00:48:13.641
And we're off!!

840
00:48:18.484 --> 00:48:19.644
Arthur?

841
00:48:21.187 --> 00:48:22.518
How long is the flight?

842
00:48:22.622 --> 00:48:25.352
It's pretty short as long as we can
avoid any unpleasant encounters.

843
00:48:25.458 --> 00:48:28.450
What do you mean by
unpleasant ncounters?

844
00:48:46.045 --> 00:48:46.977
Holy bumblebee!

845
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.843
He smashed the door in
and now we're stuck...

846
00:48:50.883 --> 00:48:51.577
Whoa!

847
00:48:52.118 --> 00:48:52.550
What is that?!

848
00:48:52.652 --> 00:48:54.984
I have no idea, but I don't think
we should hang around to find out!

849
00:48:55.088 --> 00:48:55.850
Wh... What are you doing?

850
00:48:55.955 --> 00:48:57.582
I'm getting out of here...

851
00:48:59.092 --> 00:48:59.922
Oops.

852
00:49:01.394 --> 00:49:02.452
Hold on tight...

853
00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:10.499
- I like it much better when it stops.
- Oh gosh!

854
00:49:10.603 --> 00:49:11.797
Somebody's going to get hurt with this.

855
00:49:11.904 --> 00:49:13.997
I'll hang onto it it'll be safer that way...

856
00:49:17.677 --> 00:49:18.871
Water!!!!!!

857
00:49:19.245 --> 00:49:20.234
Do something! Arthur!

858
00:49:20.346 --> 00:49:21.574
Get us out of this!

859
00:49:21.681 --> 00:49:23.842
It looks like you two are going to
have to get me out of this...

860
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:25.281
There's a hole in my boat!

861
00:49:25.385 --> 00:49:27.649
Minimoys can't swim!

862
00:49:28.021 --> 00:49:29.579
- I'm coming to get you, here I come...
- Arthur!

863
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:32.255
Arthur, please!

864
00:49:32.392 --> 00:49:33.484
I'm coming...

865
00:49:34.327 --> 00:49:35.316
I know this river.

866
00:49:35.428 --> 00:49:36.918
First there's a bend to the right,

867
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:38.691
then, there's a sharp bend to the left.

868
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.667
So to catch up with them,

869
00:49:42.769 --> 00:49:44.703
all I have to do is cut straight
across as the crow flies.

870
00:49:44.804 --> 00:49:47.432
Sorry, but as the crow flies is
as the crow flies...

871
00:49:55.948 --> 00:49:57.210
You see, I didn't abandon you...

872
00:49:57.316 --> 00:49:57.839
Oh, great!!

873
00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:00.885
So instead of the two of us drowning,
now all three of us can drown together!

874
00:50:00.987 --> 00:50:02.249
No one's going to drown, Selenia!

875
00:50:02.355 --> 00:50:04.152
Surely, you're not going to let a li'I
ol' river frighten you, are you?

876
00:50:04.257 --> 00:50:05.622
It's not the river I'm frightened of...

877
00:50:05.725 --> 00:50:07.283
It's that!

878
00:50:09.495 --> 00:50:12.055
So, Mr. "I'm here",
got any good ideas before we drown?

879
00:50:12.165 --> 00:50:13.632
Sure, course I have...

880
00:50:13.733 --> 00:50:14.893
Beta, any chance there's a rop on that

881
00:50:15.001 --> 00:50:16.468
300 function pocket knife of yours?

882
00:50:16.569 --> 00:50:19.060
Euh, no, that's only on the smaller model...

883
00:50:20.907 --> 00:50:21.874
I've got an idea!

884
00:50:22.909 --> 00:50:23.466
Hey!

885
00:50:23.576 --> 00:50:24.702
Just because we're going to die doesn't

886
00:50:24.811 --> 00:50:25.903
mean you can start taking liberties!

887
00:50:26.012 --> 00:50:26.944
No, you've got it all wrong!

888
00:50:27.046 --> 00:50:29.241
I, I need the lace
to reach that tree, over there

889
00:50:29.348 --> 00:50:31.179
I'm not so sure about this idea of yours...

890
00:50:31.284 --> 00:50:32.251
Well, I'm sure!

891
00:50:32.985 --> 00:50:34.748
Arthur, have you ever thrown
a sword like that before?

892
00:50:34.854 --> 00:50:37.414
No, but it can't be much more difficult
than playing darts.

893
00:50:40.293 --> 00:50:40.987
Betameche you go first!

894
00:50:41.094 --> 00:50:42.459
- Selenia you next!
- Yes, sir!

895
00:50:43.463 --> 00:50:44.555
Your turn Selenia...

896
00:50:45.665 --> 00:50:46.791
Betameche, hurry up!!

897
00:50:46.899 --> 00:50:48.526
I can't... I'm sliping...

898
00:50:48.634 --> 00:50:51.159
Selenia, hold on with both hands!

899
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:53.397
Absolutely no way!!

900
00:50:59.779 --> 00:51:02.577
- We're safe!
- Not quite!!

901
00:51:06.152 --> 00:51:08.279
Come on, Arthur, hurry up,
we haven't got all day.

902
00:51:08.387 --> 00:51:09.376
I'm coming.

903
00:51:11.524 --> 00:51:13.822
Selenia, you gotta admit it,
the guy is pretty agile.

904
00:51:13.926 --> 00:51:16.156
It's easy when you've got both hands free

905
00:51:19.665 --> 00:51:20.359
Thanks.

906
00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.834
Arthur, you were fantastic!

907
00:51:22.935 --> 00:51:25.995
Right, maybe Mr. Fantastic
can return my lace now?!

908
00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:29.831
It's already so hard without my husband,

909
00:51:29.942 --> 00:51:32.206
I don't know
how I'll survive without Arthur...

910
00:51:32.311 --> 00:51:33.801
I'm sure he's just run away for a spell.

911
00:51:33.913 --> 00:51:35.437
All of these events
have probably upset him...

912
00:51:35.548 --> 00:51:37.072
- Yes...
- I don't think he could have gotten far,

913
00:51:37.183 --> 00:51:39.310
and we're gonna do everything
we can to find him, ma'am.

914
00:51:39.418 --> 00:51:40.248
Okay...

915
00:51:40.353 --> 00:51:41.285
You can count on us. Ma'am.

916
00:52:01.851 --> 00:52:03.148
- What was that?!
- Humans.

917
00:52:03.252 --> 00:52:05.846
- Really?
- Yep, sometime it's like that all day long!

918
00:52:05.955 --> 00:52:08.321
Oh, rats, this map's a total washout...

919
00:52:08.424 --> 00:52:09.254
How are we ever going to find our way now?

920
00:52:09.358 --> 00:52:11.519
We'll use the position of the sun to
guide us when it comes up...

921
00:52:11.627 --> 00:52:13.356
In the meantime,
let's look for a place to sleep.

922
00:52:13.529 --> 00:52:14.791
And make sure you find us
something comfy, Selenia,

923
00:52:14.897 --> 00:52:15.989
'cause I ache all over.

924
00:52:16.098 --> 00:52:18.999
Beta, if you complain once more,
you can go sleep under a bullmunch.

925
00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:20.326
What's a bullmunch?

926
00:52:20.436 --> 00:52:22.597
It's like a gamallus,
only much, much bigger.

927
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:27.503
Beta, I'm gonna need your knife.

928
00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:28.542
Coming right up!

929
00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:30.907
Where did they put the METAGLUE? Wah!!

930
00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:33.080
- Whoops!
- Sorry!

931
00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:34.615
Give that to me, Beta!

932
00:52:34.717 --> 00:52:35.945
Before you end up hurting somebody!

933
00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:37.542
Just hang on, I haven't had it very long!

934
00:52:37.653 --> 00:52:38.950
- I just got it for my birthday.
- How old are you?

935
00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:40.044
I'm three hundred years old...

936
00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:42.317
Only another sixty years
and I will be a grown-up...

937
00:52:42.425 --> 00:52:43.619
How old's Selenia then?

938
00:52:43.726 --> 00:52:44.750
Almost a thousand years old.

939
00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:45.759
A thousand years old?!

940
00:52:45.862 --> 00:52:47.557
Oh, yes, the age of reason...

941
00:52:47.663 --> 00:52:49.358
It's her birthday in two days.

942
00:52:49.632 --> 00:52:50.656
How is this working?

943
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:52.330
Got it!

944
00:52:58.474 --> 00:52:59.202
Whoa...

945
00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:00.776
Come on.

946
00:53:06.282 --> 00:53:07.044
What's she up to?

947
00:53:07.149 --> 00:53:08.241
She's making the bed.

948
00:53:09.452 --> 00:53:10.783
I'm exhausted...

949
00:53:11.988 --> 00:53:12.920
Goodnight!

950
00:53:14.523 --> 00:53:16.821
Well he doesn't has
any trouble sleeping, does he?

951
00:53:16.926 --> 00:53:19.520
- It's normal, he's still young.
- Three hundred years young!!

952
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:20.853
It's not bad!

953
00:53:26.302 --> 00:53:27.894
So good.

954
00:53:30.573 --> 00:53:31.699
What about you...

955
00:53:31.807 --> 00:53:34.139
Are you really going to be
a thousand years old in two days?

956
00:53:34.243 --> 00:53:37.770
Aaah... Yes and in two days time
I am to succeed my father

957
00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.472
and watch over the Minimoy people until

958
00:53:39.582 --> 00:53:40.674
it shall come to pass

959
00:53:40.783 --> 00:53:44.947
that my own children reach the age
of one thousand and succeed me...

960
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:46.520
Such is the tradition!

961
00:53:46.889 --> 00:53:49.483
But to have children, you need a... husband.

962
00:53:49.592 --> 00:53:52.857
I know, but I'm not worried,
I still have two whole days to find one...

963
00:53:52.962 --> 00:53:53.986
And now...

964
00:53:54.897 --> 00:53:56.091
Goodnight...

965
00:53:57.433 --> 00:53:58.764
Arthur!

966
00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:02.102
Goodnight, princess.

967
00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:13.505
Arthur?!

968
00:54:48.217 --> 00:54:49.616
Come on, time to get up boys!

969
00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:51.482
We've got a long journey ahead of us today!

970
00:54:58.327 --> 00:55:00.090
Hello, I said, get up.

971
00:55:01.831 --> 00:55:03.696
Ok! This calls for a change of tactic!

972
00:55:06.702 --> 00:55:08.397
Come on now, shower time!

973
00:55:09.705 --> 00:55:12.139
- That's what I call a rude awakening!
- Consider yourself lucky!

974
00:55:12.241 --> 00:55:13.037
She's been waking me up like that

975
00:55:13.142 --> 00:55:15.269
every morning for
the last three hundred years!

976
00:55:31.227 --> 00:55:33.218
These are even better than the other ones!

977
00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:34.296
Here, try some!

978
00:55:35.598 --> 00:55:37.156
Tastes good! What is it exactly?

979
00:55:37.266 --> 00:55:38.392
Dragonfly eggs...

980
00:55:39.702 --> 00:55:41.465
Hey, come and take a look at this!

981
00:55:42.938 --> 00:55:44.929
Oh! Wow!

982
00:55:45.174 --> 00:55:46.402
That's awful!!

983
00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:49.238
I suppose... euh, seen from this angle...

984
00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:50.642
it is less attractive...

985
00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:53.508
Anybody have an idea
what this thing is for?!

986
00:55:53.616 --> 00:55:55.345
It's an irrigation system...

987
00:55:55.451 --> 00:55:56.543
It transports water.

988
00:55:56.652 --> 00:55:57.710
Water! More water!?

989
00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:59.447
I'm... really sorry,
I had absolutely no idea that...

990
00:55:59.555 --> 00:56:00.817
Wai, wai, wai... Wait a minute,

991
00:56:00.923 --> 00:56:03.084
you mean that you're the one
who built this monstrosity?!

992
00:56:03.192 --> 00:56:05.387
Yes... But I only wanted to
water the radishes...

993
00:56:05.494 --> 00:56:06.153
Granny loves radishes...

994
00:56:06.262 --> 00:56:08.560
You mean, you actually eat
those disgusting things?

995
00:56:08.664 --> 00:56:09.790
Let's just hope that your invention

996
00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:12.163
doesn't fall into the hands of the Evil M...

997
00:56:12.268 --> 00:56:15.169
Otherwise, I have a pretty good idea
of what he'll do with it.

998
00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:23.639
Timber!

999
00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:25.105
Watch out!

1000
00:56:25.247 --> 00:56:27.010
My straws, they're stealing my straws!

1001
00:56:27.116 --> 00:56:28.447
As long as they're
getting rid of those things,

1002
00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:29.449
I'd say they're doing us a favour.

1003
00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:31.349
Try thinking before you talk, Betameche!

1004
00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:34.480
The Evil M. Knows only too well
that the Minimoys can't stand water

1005
00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:35.921
and your friend, Arthur here,

1006
00:56:36.025 --> 00:56:38.391
just provided him
with the means to transport water...

1007
00:56:38.494 --> 00:56:40.928
- Where do you suppose he'll send it to?
- Oh! Our village!

1008
00:56:42.898 --> 00:56:43.990
Arthur, where are you going?

1009
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.931
To repair the damage I've done.

1010
00:56:47.002 --> 00:56:49.095
I can't believe that guy,
humans are really crazy.

1011
00:56:49.205 --> 00:56:51.469
That may be, but I think Arthur's right...

1012
00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:54.509
They're bound to take the straws
to Necropolis and us along with them...

1013
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:56.669
I never get to decide anything!

1014
00:56:57.847 --> 00:56:59.144
It's really nice of you to come with me...

1015
00:56:59.248 --> 00:57:02.183
I'm just worried you're gonna do
something stupid if I'm not around...

1016
00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:08.181
Pssst! Beta... Hurry up!!!

1017
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:15.722
Beta, your foot!

1018
00:57:17.233 --> 00:57:18.530
Here we go again.

1019
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:21.969
Do you know at least
where this waterway leads to?

1020
00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:23.504
No! But, in any case, all rivers

1021
00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:25.198
and waterways meet up at some point!

1022
00:57:27.543 --> 00:57:29.477
You always have such
brilliant ideas, don't you?!

1023
00:57:29.578 --> 00:57:31.671
Don't worry, I'll take care of it,
give me back your lace.

1024
00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:33.805
Absolutely no way.

1025
00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:36.613
Hold on tight!!

1026
00:57:45.694 --> 00:57:47.787
Oh! I hate public transportation!

1027
00:58:05.714 --> 00:58:07.272
Hey... What you playin' at down there?

1028
00:58:07.383 --> 00:58:10.045
If the seides find us first
we won't have a chance to tell you.

1029
00:58:10.152 --> 00:58:11.483
The seides?

1030
00:58:13.756 --> 00:58:14.484
You got a problem?

1031
00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:16.080
Nope, it's nothin', I was just checkin'

1032
00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:17.181
that the accordion part ain't damaged...

1033
00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:19.454
We don't need that part,
we're only interested in the stems!

1034
00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:22.395
- Oh, yeah, the stems, sure thing...
- Get a move on, the master is waiting.

1035
00:58:22.498 --> 00:58:24.125
Oh, yeah, the master, sure thing...

1036
00:58:24.233 --> 00:58:25.530
No problemo!

1037
00:58:29.605 --> 00:58:31.664
Whatever you do, don't move
until I come back and get you, got it?

1038
00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:32.968
No problemo!

1039
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:35.938
So where are these refugees of yours?

1040
00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:39.242
I've hidden them in a mega discreet place!

1041
00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:47.989
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yup, and mega discreet like you said.

1042
00:58:49.191 --> 00:58:50.590
Jackfire all 'round!

1043
00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:52.661
- Yes please!
- Yes, yes, yes!

1044
00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:53.762
Sure, thanks.

1045
00:58:53.862 --> 00:58:55.887
Hey, Jack!? Fill 'em up, this one's on me!

1046
00:58:58.567 --> 00:58:59.966
He, he, he. Yes!

1047
00:59:03.973 --> 00:59:05.565
Long live the Seven Kingdoms!

1048
00:59:05.674 --> 00:59:07.369
Long live the Seven Kingdoms!

1049
00:59:09.311 --> 00:59:10.539
Yeah!

1050
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:12.744
Aah!

1051
00:59:12.848 --> 00:59:13.678
Just what I needed...

1052
00:59:13.782 --> 00:59:15.750
Oh, yep, that hits the spot!

1053
00:59:16.385 --> 00:59:18.615
It's the best jackfire in town baby!

1054
00:59:19.822 --> 00:59:20.652
Oh, euh...

1055
00:59:20.756 --> 00:59:22.986
Sorry, euh... To the Seven Kingdoms!

1056
00:59:29.064 --> 00:59:30.156
That's refreshing stuff!

1057
00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:32.461
As long as you here with me,
there's really nothing to fear.

1058
00:59:32.568 --> 00:59:34.729
I'm the boss here. My name is Max.

1059
00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:35.735
Hiya Max!

1060
00:59:35.838 --> 00:59:37.533
And you, young lady, who might you be?

1061
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.902
Selenia. Daughter of Emperor Sifrat of

1062
00:59:39.008 --> 00:59:40.873
Matradoy, the fifteenth of that name,

1063
00:59:40.976 --> 00:59:42.500
governor of the First Kingdom.

1064
00:59:42.611 --> 00:59:43.509
Wow!

1065
00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:46.247
Delighted to meet you, baby!

1066
00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:48.173
Jack, same again.

1067
00:59:50.853 --> 00:59:52.445
Hey, yo Easylow!

1068
00:59:52.655 --> 00:59:53.587
Yes, boss?

1069
00:59:53.822 --> 00:59:55.551
Let's get this show on the road!

1070
00:59:55.658 --> 00:59:56.716
You got it!

1071
01:00:00.329 --> 01:00:02.524
May I have the honor of this dance, Princess?

1072
01:00:02.631 --> 01:00:04.030
Selenia? We ought to be making a move,

1073
01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:05.031
we've still got a long way to go!

1074
01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:06.465
Certainly.

1075
01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:17.140
She's too old for me anyway!

1076
01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:18.508
She's a thousand, I'm only ten!

1077
01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:20.206
What would I want with an older woman?

1078
01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:27.754
What's a good lookin' kid like you
doin'in front of an empty glass?

1079
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:30.824
Well if wasn't empty you
couldn't fill it up, could you?

1080
01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.993
I like your sense of humour, kid...

1081
01:00:33.095 --> 01:00:36.087
I can tell we're
gonna get along just fine... Jack!

1082
01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.926
Hey, hey, hey, take it easy...

1083
01:00:39.034 --> 01:00:41.901
If you want to find a husband in two days,
then, there's no time to lose!

1084
01:00:42.004 --> 01:00:44.598
- But I can help you out if you like...
- Oh, that's sweet of you, thanks.

1085
01:00:44.707 --> 01:00:46.174
I like to help out, besides which,

1086
01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.674
hings are pretty tame right now.

1087
01:00:47.776 --> 01:00:48.902
I only have seven wives.

1088
01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:50.376
Wow! Seven wives? That a...

1089
01:00:50.479 --> 01:00:52.071
That must take a lot out of you!

1090
01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:52.977
I like hard work,

1091
01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:55.073
I can work night and day

1092
01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:58.244
seven days a week, and I never get tired.

1093
01:00:58.354 --> 01:00:58.786
Ah, ah, ah...

1094
01:00:58.887 --> 01:01:00.149
Wonderful!

1095
01:01:01.423 --> 01:01:03.015
So, where do I sign?

1096
01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:06.219
Anywhere you like, kid,
it doesn't make any difference.

1097
01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:10.956
Oh, Selenia!

1098
01:01:11.066 --> 01:01:12.226
Excuse me, but...

1099
01:01:12.334 --> 01:01:13.961
He's already signed up elsewhere.

1100
01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:17.834
Selenia, it's...

1101
01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.908
Are you really gonna be
a thousand years old?

1102
01:01:20.008 --> 01:01:21.805
Yes, but we count the years
in Selenielle blooms

1103
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:23.400
Selenielle's the royal flower.

1104
01:01:23.512 --> 01:01:24.137
Ah!

1105
01:01:24.246 --> 01:01:25.941
Ok, Selenielles.

1106
01:01:26.048 --> 01:01:27.242
So, how old does that make me?

1107
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:28.646
About the same age as me!

1108
01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:30.582
Wow! That's amazing!

1109
01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:33.120
And uh... So, before,
were you a little girl like me?

1110
01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:35.747
- What?
- No, uh... I mean, I'm a boy of course,

1111
01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.086
but... Were you a little girl,

1112
01:01:37.192 --> 01:01:38.682
like the other little girls
in my neighborhood?

1113
01:01:38.794 --> 01:01:40.125
No, I was born as I am...

1114
01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:42.993
And I've never set foot
outside the Seven Kingdoms.

1115
01:01:43.098 --> 01:01:45.430
I'd really like to take you
to my world one day.

1116
01:01:52.908 --> 01:01:53.670
That's Malthazar!?

1117
01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:56.904
No, lucky for you,
it's only Darkos, his son.

1118
01:01:58.847 --> 01:01:59.677
Hey!

1119
01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:01.875
Darkos this is an honour...

1120
01:02:04.686 --> 01:02:07.746
Great timing, there's quite a vibe
going down here this evening.

1121
01:02:07.856 --> 01:02:12.589
I can see that. Organizing parties
without inviting our friends now, are we?

1122
01:02:12.694 --> 01:02:14.423
No way, it wasn't planned...

1123
01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:16.054
Just a little something we improvised,

1124
01:02:16.165 --> 01:02:17.928
to impress the new punters, you know...

1125
01:02:18.033 --> 01:02:19.295
New faces?

1126
01:02:21.236 --> 01:02:22.498
Warm me if he comes this way...

1127
01:02:24.873 --> 01:02:25.430
Heeeey...

1128
01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:26.667
Darkos, what's up?!

1129
01:02:26.775 --> 01:02:27.673
Selenia...

1130
01:02:27.776 --> 01:02:30.768
What's a princess of your rank
doing in a place like this?

1131
01:02:30.879 --> 01:02:32.176
I just dropped in for a dance.

1132
01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:35.409
Ah! Well then, let's dance!

1133
01:02:35.517 --> 01:02:36.279
Darkos, sweetheart...

1134
01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:38.876
I would rather die than dance with you!

1135
01:02:38.987 --> 01:02:40.978
Your wish is my command, Princess!

1136
01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:43.557
You will dance... for all eternity!!!

1137
01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:45.817
Easylow, get this place rockin'.

1138
01:02:46.695 --> 01:02:47.662
Get them!!

1139
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:03.241
Arthur! Look out!

1140
01:03:05.814 --> 01:03:07.873
Hey, they're putting up a good fight.

1141
01:03:07.983 --> 01:03:10.042
Let's see if they've got the groove.

1142
01:03:30.839 --> 01:03:33.831
Staying alive. Huh-huh-huh-huh...

1143
01:03:33.942 --> 01:03:36.410
I think I'll go get some reinforcements.

1144
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.574
Yeah!

1145
01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:40.378
Hey, I like this kid!

1146
01:03:40.749 --> 01:03:43.616
Oh! Three against one, huh?!
Then I'll just triple the power!

1147
01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:46.119
Oh! How sweet!! So...
You shouldn't have!

1148
01:03:46.221 --> 01:03:47.620
Really, it was nothing.

1149
01:03:51.059 --> 01:03:53.118
Woooh, that's my girl...

1150
01:03:59.134 --> 01:04:00.624
Holy gullybars! You scared me!!

1151
01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:01.202
What are you doing here?

1152
01:04:01.303 --> 01:04:04.238
I lost my knife,
I gotta find something else.

1153
01:04:05.674 --> 01:04:07.266
- You find anything??
- Ahhh! Naa!

1154
01:04:15.317 --> 01:04:16.249
My knife!

1155
01:04:17.986 --> 01:04:22.150
Wooh, that's entertainment!

1156
01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.726
Easylow, closing time I think!!

1157
01:04:33.602 --> 01:04:35.433
- Charge.
- Charge... my butt!

1158
01:04:39.174 --> 01:04:40.198
Got'em! There they are!

1159
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.866
I've got one!

1160
01:04:40.976 --> 01:04:41.670
- I got one!!
- Let go of me, you idiot!

1161
01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:43.642
- One of them bit me!
- Sorry, boss!

1162
01:04:43.745 --> 01:04:45.212
Somebody turn the lights on!

1163
01:04:50.652 --> 01:04:51.619
What's going on??!

1164
01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.688
I'm just following your orders, my Lord,

1165
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:56.417
ten o'clock curfew! And it's ten o'clock!

1166
01:04:57.926 --> 01:05:01.623
Late opening authorization granted!!!

1167
01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:04.231
Cool, real cool!

1168
01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.162
Come on man, follow me!

1169
01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:11.303
Look, if you go this way, you'll travel safe!

1170
01:05:12.374 --> 01:05:13.602
Oh, great!!

1171
01:05:13.775 --> 01:05:17.438
This is from Max! It will
lead you right to M's quarters.

1172
01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:24.848
I'm sure glad me ain't goin' along!

1173
01:05:29.024 --> 01:05:30.321
Get out, move aside!

1174
01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:36.727
I... want... them!!!!!

1175
01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.294
What was that unearthly scream?

1176
01:05:39.401 --> 01:05:41.767
Oh, just Darkos throwing
a little temper tantrum.

1177
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:43.394
Do you think Max will
be able to delay him for long?

1178
01:05:43.505 --> 01:05:46.030
Max is a real smooth talker,
I think we can count on him.

1179
01:05:46.141 --> 01:05:47.005
Come on, let's go...

1180
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:49.873
Yeah, yeah, right, how can you even
think about trusting a guy like...

1181
01:05:49.978 --> 01:05:51.275
- Wait?
- Don't start Betameche!

1182
01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:54.008
Just keep walking and shut up, please.

1183
01:05:54.516 --> 01:05:55.608
Wh-wh-what's that growling noise?!!!

1184
01:05:55.717 --> 01:05:57.514
What growling noise?
I don't hear anything...

1185
01:05:57.619 --> 01:05:58.347
Cut it out, Selenia!

1186
01:05:58.453 --> 01:05:59.920
I know you're just saying
that to give me the creeps!

1187
01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:00.750
Come on, what was it?

1188
01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:03.654
It's the Yeti... He's growling because
you woke him up

1189
01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:05.192
and now, he's gonna eat you!

1190
01:06:05.293 --> 01:06:05.918
- Oh, no... I did?
- Now what did you say?

1191
01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:07.791
The Yeti?! Really??!!

1192
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:22.636
Surprise!!

1193
01:06:23.111 --> 01:06:26.444
Well this is... a... surprise...

1194
01:06:26.748 --> 01:06:27.840
Where's Arthur?

1195
01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:30.908
In the garden.

1196
01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:33.052
In the... In the garden?

1197
01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:35.956
This is it!

1198
01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:36.820
Thank you, Betameche!

1199
01:06:36.925 --> 01:06:38.620
Without you, we'd be completely lost!

1200
01:06:38.727 --> 01:06:40.957
- Now, give me your knife!
- Okay, but don't break it!

1201
01:06:44.566 --> 01:06:45.965
Oh come on, boys, let's go.

1202
01:06:46.134 --> 01:06:48.261
- After you, Selenia!
- Princesses first.

1203
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:51.168
Men only act like gentlemen
when it suits them, huh?

1204
01:06:54.843 --> 01:06:55.537
Well, uh...

1205
01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:56.872
Princes second.

1206
01:07:04.453 --> 01:07:05.681
Guess it's my turn.

1207
01:07:14.229 --> 01:07:15.491
What do you mean he disappeared?

1208
01:07:15.597 --> 01:07:20.796
Every night I told him stories about
his Grandpa's adventures in Africa.

1209
01:07:21.002 --> 01:07:24.028
And, last night I told him
about the Minimoys...

1210
01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:25.231
The Min, the Mini what?

1211
01:07:25.407 --> 01:07:26.431
The Minimoys!

1212
01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:30.272
And, um... He became convinced
that they live in our garden.

1213
01:07:30.378 --> 01:07:30.935
In the garden?

1214
01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:33.276
These are just fairy tales
and legends, Granny...

1215
01:07:33.381 --> 01:07:34.848
Of course, but then,

1216
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.919
since I made the mistake
of letting him know

1217
01:07:38.019 --> 01:07:39.782
about our money problems,

1218
01:07:39.888 --> 01:07:44.325
he got it into his head to find
the treasure that grandpa hid.

1219
01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:46.786
What treasure?

1220
01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.423
Honey,

1221
01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:54.194
what's the use of finding the treasure
if Arthur isn't here to enjoy it?

1222
01:07:54.302 --> 01:07:55.200
Don't worry, Granny.

1223
01:07:55.303 --> 01:07:57.134
I'm sure Arthur will be right back.

1224
01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:59.833
He... He just took
a little time off, that's all...

1225
01:08:00.275 --> 01:08:01.674
- No, in the hole...
- Sorry!

1226
01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:03.044
Not the face!!

1227
01:08:04.546 --> 01:08:05.478
Hurry!

1228
01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:15.189
Selenia, it's crawling with Seides!

1229
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:17.053
Duh... What do you think we're hiding for?

1230
01:08:22.097 --> 01:08:22.688
What are they doing?

1231
01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:24.265
They must be taking food to their Master...

1232
01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:25.594
Let's follow them.

1233
01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:33.602
- Do you think he's there?
- Yep!

1234
01:08:33.708 --> 01:08:35.437
Wh-wh-what are we gonna do, Selenia?

1235
01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:37.842
I'm gonna spoil his lunch.

1236
01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.142
He's not going to like that!

1237
01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:42.841
But...

1238
01:08:42.951 --> 01:08:44.646
This is where our paths separate, Arthur.

1239
01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:45.811
I have to deal with this alone...

1240
01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:46.410
What do you mean?

1241
01:08:46.521 --> 01:08:47.351
I thought we were a team?

1242
01:08:47.455 --> 01:08:49.082
Well, the team is about to split up!

1243
01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:50.522
You're gonna go look for your treasure.

1244
01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:52.115
And I'm gonna take care of M...

1245
01:08:52.227 --> 01:08:54.320
If I succeed, we'll meet back here...

1246
01:08:54.429 --> 01:08:55.453
And if you fail?

1247
01:08:56.231 --> 01:08:57.357
If I should fail...

1248
01:08:57.465 --> 01:09:00.025
I bequeath all my powers to you.

1249
01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:01.295
What do you mean?

1250
01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:08.306
Be a good king...!

1251
01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.344
But, wait... We have to...

1252
01:09:11.513 --> 01:09:12.445
Sele...

1253
01:09:14.482 --> 01:09:15.574
Congratulations, Arthur

1254
01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:16.844
it was a wonderful wedding...

1255
01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:18.817
Really one of the loveliest weddings
I've ever been to!

1256
01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.047
Very moving, clear, concise and quick!

1257
01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:22.418
Yeah... A little too quick.

1258
01:09:22.524 --> 01:09:24.082
Oh, no, you got the most important things,

1259
01:09:24.192 --> 01:09:25.784
her hand and her heart...
What more do you want??

1260
01:09:25.894 --> 01:09:28.624
Well, I don't know...
Maybe like a party or something?

1261
01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:30.459
If you would allow me the pleasure...

1262
01:09:30.565 --> 01:09:34.296
I would love to be the one
to organize that party!

1263
01:10:03.932 --> 01:10:06.867
I spent entire days polishing
that sword to perfection...

1264
01:10:06.968 --> 01:10:09.129
I'd recognize that sound anywhere...

1265
01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:15.875
And who else would have been able to
draw the sword from the stone

1266
01:10:15.977 --> 01:10:18.673
besides you, Selenia?

1267
01:10:19.581 --> 01:10:21.742
I am delighted to see you, Princess.

1268
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:24.946
Likewise! This way I'll be able to kill
you with my own two hands...

1269
01:10:25.053 --> 01:10:26.680
Why so much hatred?

1270
01:10:26.788 --> 01:10:28.221
Because you betrayed your own people,

1271
01:10:28.323 --> 01:10:29.722
slaughtered entire populations

1272
01:10:29.824 --> 01:10:32.793
and bound the rest into slavery
you're nothing but a monster!

1273
01:10:32.894 --> 01:10:34.327
Speak not of monsters...!

1274
01:10:34.596 --> 01:10:37.224
Nor of things of which you are ignorant!

1275
01:10:37.832 --> 01:10:40.699
Back in the time when I was
known as Malthazar the Good,

1276
01:10:40.802 --> 01:10:42.463
Malthazar the Bountiful...

1277
01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:44.561
He who watches and protects...

1278
01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:47.039
I inspired such trust and confidence...

1279
01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.234
That when the drought came...

1280
01:10:48.343 --> 01:10:50.140
One which lasted a thousand years...

1281
01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:52.213
I was the one they chose for the crusade,

1282
01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:54.339
with the task of
bringing back water, of course...

1283
01:10:54.449 --> 01:10:56.940
But also, all the riches I could reap...

1284
01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:59.520
Malthazar the Conqueror!

1285
01:11:00.221 --> 01:11:02.746
How they praised
and applauded me when I left,

1286
01:11:02.857 --> 01:11:04.950
but I faced every hardship quite alone.

1287
01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:08.996
The hostile lands, the ferocious beasts,
the bloodthirsty tribes...

1288
01:11:09.097 --> 01:11:11.964
lurking in the depths
of contaminated plateaus

1289
01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:14.160
where even the humans dare not go...

1290
01:11:14.602 --> 01:11:16.263
But I survived all that.

1291
01:11:16.538 --> 01:11:19.905
And having accomplished my mission,
I returned to my village...

1292
01:11:20.008 --> 01:11:22.476
Malthazar the Hero!

1293
01:11:24.312 --> 01:11:26.371
Yet, it was not long before the diseases

1294
01:11:26.481 --> 01:11:30.349
and bewitchments which I had encountered
during my voyage began to...

1295
01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:32.079
disfigure my body.

1296
01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:34.985
Fear spread through the people,
fear of contamination...

1297
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:37.251
People stopped speaking to me...

1298
01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:39.350
They crossed the street when I approached...

1299
01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:42.624
And very soon, I became Malthazar,

1300
01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:45.063
the Evil M!

1301
01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:45.632
Uh, uh.

1302
01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:48.362
The version recorded in history books
is slightly different.

1303
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.768
It is said that when you returned
from your voyage,

1304
01:11:50.872 --> 01:11:52.635
you celebrated for months on end...

1305
01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:56.177
Each day sinking a little further
into drinking and debauchery...

1306
01:11:56.277 --> 01:11:57.767
Until you began keeping company

1307
01:11:57.879 --> 01:12:01.246
with the worst kinds of insects,
even poisonous ones...

1308
01:12:01.449 --> 01:12:02.746
Like a certain pretty, young...

1309
01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:04.079
Uh... weevil!

1310
01:12:04.185 --> 01:12:04.776
Silence!!

1311
01:12:04.886 --> 01:12:06.979
You gave your powers to her,
she gave her powers to you!

1312
01:12:07.088 --> 01:12:08.578
That's enough, I tell you!!

1313
01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:11.982
I was drunk!

1314
01:12:12.093 --> 01:12:14.618
Ah, well, if you can't hold your liquor,
you shouldn't indulge.

1315
01:12:14.729 --> 01:12:17.459
Yes, I know. I let myself go a bit and.

1316
01:12:17.565 --> 01:12:19.624
It's true, she stole a kiss from me.

1317
01:12:19.734 --> 01:12:22.726
One single kiss
which has ruined my entire life

1318
01:12:22.837 --> 01:12:25.465
Next time, try being a little more
selective in your choice of partner.

1319
01:12:25.573 --> 01:12:29.441
Next time, my partner will be
the most beautiful of all...

1320
01:12:29.544 --> 01:12:32.843
She whom I have watched blossom
like a delicate flower

1321
01:12:32.947 --> 01:12:37.008
and whom I have long dreamt of picking.

1322
01:12:37.719 --> 01:12:40.017
Watch yourself, delicate flowers
might have thorns!

1323
01:12:40.121 --> 01:12:43.318
Yes... And this lovely flower
alone has the power

1324
01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.723
to release me from
the spell that binds me

1325
01:12:45.827 --> 01:12:48.387
and make me look like
my old self again.

1326
01:12:48.496 --> 01:12:50.623
Only the very first kiss of
a princess has the power...

1327
01:12:50.732 --> 01:12:52.199
I know, and...

1328
01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:55.963
If my information is correct,
you are still unmarried...

1329
01:12:56.404 --> 01:12:58.929
Your information is
a little out-of-date.

1330
01:13:00.408 --> 01:13:02.467
- Master...
- Who dares disturb me?!

1331
01:13:02.577 --> 01:13:04.704
It's me Bruce but I have I new helmet.

1332
01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.611
Speak up!

1333
01:13:13.121 --> 01:13:16.318
Well, Selenia, you're more clever
than I thought you were.

1334
01:13:16.424 --> 01:13:17.049
Thank you.

1335
01:13:17.158 --> 01:13:19.854
You could have saved my life,
but you chose not to...

1336
01:13:19.961 --> 01:13:22.555
Don't count on me to spare yours!!

1337
01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:26.600
Don't worry, Selenia,
you won't die right away...

1338
01:13:26.768 --> 01:13:28.429
You'll just suffer a little first,

1339
01:13:28.536 --> 01:13:31.630
as you watch the destruction of your people!

1340
01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:33.939
You're a monster, Malthazar!

1341
01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:36.010
I know, I get it from my wife...

1342
01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:37.403
Take her away!

1343
01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:44.176
Leave me alone, let me go!

1344
01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:50.052
I'm married five minutes

1345
01:13:50.158 --> 01:13:52.422
and I already feel like
a widower, and a jailbird!

1346
01:13:52.527 --> 01:13:53.425
We gotta get out of here, Beta...

1347
01:13:53.528 --> 01:13:54.460
We gotta think of something.

1348
01:13:54.562 --> 01:13:55.586
I'm thinking, Arthur, I'm thinking!

1349
01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:56.288
The powers...

1350
01:13:56.397 --> 01:13:57.796
What about the powers
she gave me when she kissed me?

1351
01:13:57.899 --> 01:13:58.228
I don't know!

1352
01:13:58.333 --> 01:13:59.027
What do you mean, you don't know!

1353
01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:00.567
Strangling him won't do you any good!

1354
01:14:00.668 --> 01:14:03.330
And besides, you'd better save
your energy if you want to eat!

1355
01:14:04.172 --> 01:14:04.831
What do you mean?

1356
01:14:04.939 --> 01:14:05.871
If you want to eat down here,

1357
01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:07.703
you'll have to teach them
something new every day,

1358
01:14:07.809 --> 01:14:09.071
otherwise you'll go hungry...

1359
01:14:09.177 --> 01:14:09.905
And it makes sense...

1360
01:14:10.011 --> 01:14:10.773
complete sense...

1361
01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:13.143
Knowledge is the one true source of wealth,
is it not?!

1362
01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:15.773
- What kinds of things do they want to know?
- Pfff... Anything will do!

1363
01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:18.717
From the elementary laws of physics
to the behavioral patterns of winkles...

1364
01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:20.253
Even how to cook garden peas.

1365
01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:21.481
I taught them to write...

1366
01:14:21.589 --> 01:14:23.648
And to paint, especially huge canvasses...

1367
01:14:23.758 --> 01:14:24.986
And to harness light using mirrors.

1368
01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:27.288
And transport water
from one place to another...

1369
01:14:27.395 --> 01:14:29.454
Yes, that's true,
but how did you know all that?

1370
01:14:29.564 --> 01:14:30.462
Because the man who invented

1371
01:14:30.565 --> 01:14:32.692
all those wonderful things
is my grandfather!

1372
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:33.630
Arthur?!

1373
01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:34.463
Grandpa!

1374
01:14:34.569 --> 01:14:38.869
Oh my grandson,
I'm so happy to see you again!

1375
01:14:38.973 --> 01:14:40.565
Let me look at you...

1376
01:14:40.808 --> 01:14:42.002
My, how you've grown!

1377
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:43.236
It feels more like I've shrunk!

1378
01:14:43.344 --> 01:14:44.368
Yes, that's true.

1379
01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:45.969
But how did you
manage to get down here?

1380
01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.547
Well, I found your riddle...

1381
01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.344
Oh, yes, of course! My riddle,

1382
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:51.475
oh, you are a true hero!

1383
01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:53.380
Hello, Archibald, remember me?

1384
01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:55.615
Betameche?! Is that really you?

1385
01:14:55.723 --> 01:14:56.519
Hun, hun...

1386
01:14:56.624 --> 01:14:58.387
Oh... I'm so happy to see you again...

1387
01:14:58.493 --> 01:14:59.858
How is your father, that noble king?

1388
01:14:59.961 --> 01:15:00.985
Very well indeed, thank you.

1389
01:15:01.095 --> 01:15:04.326
And your sister,
the charming Princess Selenia?

1390
01:15:06.901 --> 01:15:08.198
Oh! Selenia.

1391
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:10.303
I failed, Arthur...

1392
01:15:10.638 --> 01:15:13.732
I'm sorry, all is lost!

1393
01:15:13.841 --> 01:15:15.399
No, as long as we're still alive

1394
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:17.478
and love each other,
nothing will ever be lost...

1395
01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:18.876
You are so full of hope!

1396
01:15:19.547 --> 01:15:21.572
You can never give up hope. Look at me,

1397
01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:23.810
only yesterday,
I was just a small, lonely kid,

1398
01:15:23.918 --> 01:15:26.614
and today, well, I married a princess!

1399
01:15:27.021 --> 01:15:28.886
A happy princess...

1400
01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:32.191
Because she's finally
found her prince charming...

1401
01:15:36.631 --> 01:15:38.599
W- W-Whoa!
Time out! I don't mean to be rude,

1402
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.429
but don't you think you should
maybe respect the tradition?

1403
01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:41.524
Heu...

1404
01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:43.703
Yes, he's right, what was I thinking?

1405
01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:45.670
Oh, hey!

1406
01:15:45.773 --> 01:15:47.741
Archibald! How are you?

1407
01:15:47.842 --> 01:15:49.434
Well, actually, not bad at all, Selenia.

1408
01:15:49.544 --> 01:15:50.772
What a pleasure to see you again...

1409
01:15:50.878 --> 01:15:52.209
Likewise, likewise!

1410
01:15:52.313 --> 01:15:54.076
Selenia, what's this tradition business?

1411
01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:55.547
Once the first kiss has been exchanged,

1412
01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:56.844
then you have to wait
another thousand years,

1413
01:15:56.951 --> 01:15:59.010
because then desire
and faith have to be put to the test...

1414
01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.712
that which is rare is always valued highly...

1415
01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:01.846
She has a point, you know...

1416
01:16:01.956 --> 01:16:03.321
And as a Princess, it is my duty

1417
01:16:03.424 --> 01:16:05.585
to follow the teachings of the Great Book.

1418
01:16:05.693 --> 01:16:06.523
Besides, you ought to do the same,

1419
01:16:06.628 --> 01:16:08.118
instead of trying to steal kisses from me!

1420
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:10.060
Me?! It wasn't me, you were the one...

1421
01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:15.397
Come along now, you two lovebirds,
it's Showtime!

1422
01:16:17.905 --> 01:16:18.872
If you would care to...

1423
01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:20.401
Gate open, boss.

1424
01:16:33.321 --> 01:16:34.253
My God...

1425
01:16:34.355 --> 01:16:36.084
When I think that it was
I that taught them all this

1426
01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:37.555
and now they are going to
use it against us!

1427
01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:39.923
When I think that I was the one
who gave them the straws...!

1428
01:16:53.441 --> 01:16:55.432
Look! It's Mino,
Miro's son, he's still alive!!

1429
01:17:00.948 --> 01:17:02.006
The treasure!

1430
01:17:07.722 --> 01:17:10.816
Archibald, what a great pleasure it
is to see you again...

1431
01:17:10.925 --> 01:17:12.085
The pleasure is all yours.

1432
01:17:12.193 --> 01:17:14.559
So, Archibald,
aren't you proud of the marvelous

1433
01:17:14.662 --> 01:17:16.596
use I've made of your knowledge?

1434
01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:17.665
Looks like a fine structure...

1435
01:17:17.765 --> 01:17:20.063
A shame it's only purpose
is to flood the Minimoys!

1436
01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:21.192
Oh no, not only that...

1437
01:17:21.302 --> 01:17:22.929
We are going to drown them,
pulverize them,

1438
01:17:23.037 --> 01:17:25.005
and destroy them forever.

1439
01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.400
They will die in agony
with my name upon their lips.

1440
01:17:28.509 --> 01:17:30.568
Look, read my lips...

1441
01:17:30.678 --> 01:17:33.476
Mal - tha - zar

1442
01:17:33.581 --> 01:17:35.105
You really are a monster!

1443
01:17:35.216 --> 01:17:37.275
Maybe...
But I also know how to be noble!

1444
01:17:37.585 --> 01:17:39.246
You are free.

1445
01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:44.257
See?!

1446
01:17:44.359 --> 01:17:46.384
All you have to do
is follow this tunnel

1447
01:17:46.494 --> 01:17:48.052
and you'll be home in no time!

1448
01:17:48.162 --> 01:17:49.823
As soon as we're inside that tunnel,
you'll flood it...

1449
01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:52.729
My poor Selenia,
What a twisted mind you have!!

1450
01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.802
Come on, hurry up,
before I change my mind...

1451
01:17:54.902 --> 01:17:56.335
- Sire?
- What is it now?

1452
01:17:56.437 --> 01:17:59.895
May I ask Your Highness to grant me
one last favor before I die...

1453
01:18:00.007 --> 01:18:02.373
I like this kid! What is this favor?

1454
01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:04.001
I would like to leave
my only valued possession,

1455
01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:06.478
this bracelet, to my friend, Mino.

1456
01:18:10.518 --> 01:18:11.280
Grante.

1457
01:18:13.654 --> 01:18:14.313
Your father sent me!

1458
01:18:14.422 --> 01:18:15.184
I'll get you out of here...

1459
01:18:15.289 --> 01:18:18.019
But you need to signal
your position at noon precisely!

1460
01:18:18.126 --> 01:18:19.718
Si, si, si... Signal my position, but how?

1461
01:18:19.827 --> 01:18:21.658
Using your mirrors, Mino, mirrors...!

1462
01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:23.196
Oh? Yes! Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi... mirrors!

1463
01:18:23.297 --> 01:18:24.059
That's enough!

1464
01:18:24.165 --> 01:18:26.861
Patience is the only thing
for which I set myself a limit...!

1465
01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:28.333
At noon, high noon, on the dot!

1466
01:18:28.436 --> 01:18:31.530
I shall allow you
a head start of three minutes.

1467
01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:39.137
- I hope he burns in hell!
- He's already there, Selenia, hurry!

1468
01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.375
- Darkos?
- Yes, father?

1469
01:18:41.482 --> 01:18:43.347
Prepare to open the floodgates

1470
01:18:45.787 --> 01:18:46.719
Come on, come on!

1471
01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:50.487
Is there nothing to nibble?

1472
01:18:50.591 --> 01:18:53.219
I do love something to nibble
on during a good show.

1473
01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:56.022
I can't go on...

1474
01:18:56.297 --> 01:18:57.730
And what's the point
in running anyway?!

1475
01:18:57.832 --> 01:18:59.197
Grandpa, come on, hurry...

1476
01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.200
You go on! I'm staying here...

1477
01:19:01.302 --> 01:19:03.896
To await my death with a little dignity.

1478
01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:05.632
Come on, Grandpa! You can do it.

1479
01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.002
Arthur! What's the point?

1480
01:19:07.108 --> 01:19:09.668
You must face up to it,
son, we're done for.

1481
01:19:12.246 --> 01:19:14.009
Your Highness, a few tasty titbits...

1482
01:19:18.319 --> 01:19:20.378
Mmm... Delicious! Bring me more!

1483
01:19:20.488 --> 01:19:21.580
Yes, master!

1484
01:19:22.123 --> 01:19:23.215
There must be a solution!

1485
01:19:23.324 --> 01:19:24.313
There's always a solution...

1486
01:19:24.425 --> 01:19:26.450
The only solution is to pray, my children...

1487
01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:27.391
Pray for a miracle!

1488
01:19:27.495 --> 01:19:28.894
The problem is,
I've already asked the Great Goddess

1489
01:19:28.996 --> 01:19:29.963
of the Forest for so many miracles...

1490
01:19:30.064 --> 01:19:31.463
I'm afraid she might get mad!

1491
01:19:39.073 --> 01:19:40.597
- A miracle!
- A miracle, where?!

1492
01:19:40.708 --> 01:19:43.609
Right here, Grandpa,
you're sitting on it. Look!

1493
01:19:44.512 --> 01:19:45.774
Come and give me a hand...!

1494
01:19:47.815 --> 01:19:49.282
Come on, push!

1495
01:19:53.254 --> 01:19:54.915
- What is this thing?
- It's a car.

1496
01:19:55.022 --> 01:19:57.422
It's a Ferrari 250 GTI 12-cylinder!

1497
01:19:57.525 --> 01:19:58.321
It's a birthday present!

1498
01:19:58.426 --> 01:19:59.916
Don't tell me you know
how to drive that thing?

1499
01:20:00.027 --> 01:20:02.018
Of course I do! If the young lady
would care to step this way...

1500
01:20:02.129 --> 01:20:04.097
Oh... God, whatever!

1501
01:20:09.103 --> 01:20:10.229
Bingo!

1502
01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:28.420
Hurry, Arthur, please get in!

1503
01:20:28.523 --> 01:20:30.855
If we want make it the whole way,
we have to wind it up as far as it will go.

1504
01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:32.050
Arthur, the water is coming!!!

1505
01:20:32.193 --> 01:20:33.125
Hurry, Arthur, please.

1506
01:20:33.227 --> 01:20:34.694
Got it!! This is the first time

1507
01:20:34.795 --> 01:20:36.228
I've ever taken a girl
out for a drive, you know!

1508
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:38.423
Well, let's just hope
it won't be the last step on it!

1509
01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:39.329
We're off!

1510
01:20:42.803 --> 01:20:44.327
Faster!

1511
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:51.569
I just hope there aren't any speed
cameras down here, or we've had it!

1512
01:20:51.679 --> 01:20:52.703
Hey, go to the left!

1513
01:20:57.351 --> 01:21:00.081
I'd appreciate a little more warning
next time if that's ok with you?

1514
01:21:00.187 --> 01:21:01.279
Ok, Turn right

1515
01:21:04.058 --> 01:21:05.821
- Which way do I go now, left or right?
- Down!!!

1516
01:21:10.464 --> 01:21:11.396
Selenia... I... I don't feel so good!!

1517
01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:13.729
Just hang in there, the road is smoother now.

1518
01:21:24.245 --> 01:21:25.803
Honey, do you hear that strange noise?

1519
01:21:25.913 --> 01:21:27.574
It sounds like there's
running water underneath.

1520
01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:28.148
Oh great,

1521
01:21:28.249 --> 01:21:30.649
now you're hearing voices,
just like Joan of Arc did!?

1522
01:21:30.751 --> 01:21:33.345
Next thing you know you're
gonna be seeing little angels

1523
01:21:33.454 --> 01:21:37.288
and great big ghosts with spears
and armour coming after you...

1524
01:21:37.391 --> 01:21:38.983
Wait, wait, you might want to
turn around, there's...

1525
01:21:39.093 --> 01:21:42.756
There's large men with necklaces
and feathers and I don't know...

1526
01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:46.758
What the...

1527
01:21:51.372 --> 01:21:52.703
What time is it? Please

1528
01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:54.604
The time??!!! Sure!

1529
01:21:55.109 --> 01:21:55.939
According to our calculations,

1530
01:21:56.043 --> 01:21:59.012
the water should hit the village
in three balls time.

1531
01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:01.610
What time is it, my dear Miro?

1532
01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:03.240
Five to noon, my good King.

1533
01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:05.410
Only five minutes left
and still no news.

1534
01:22:05.519 --> 01:22:06.577
Have faith in them, my good King...

1535
01:22:06.687 --> 01:22:07.881
I am sure that they will succeed.

1536
01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:10.614
May the Gods hear you, Miro,
may the gods hear you...

1537
01:22:21.335 --> 01:22:22.563
Look, there's the gate!

1538
01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:25.871
We made it! Yes!

1539
01:22:30.544 --> 01:22:32.478
Arthur, you're not going
break down on us now?!

1540
01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:34.241
Sorry, I guess we're
gonna have to get out and...

1541
01:22:34.348 --> 01:22:35.542
Run!!!

1542
01:22:39.353 --> 01:22:40.547
What is that rumbling noise?

1543
01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:43.453
I have no idea, Sire,
but I have a terrible foreboding...

1544
01:22:43.557 --> 01:22:45.889
Father, it's me, Selenia!

1545
01:22:45.993 --> 01:22:47.358
My daughter, they have returned!!

1546
01:22:47.461 --> 01:22:48.792
Open the gate!

1547
01:22:49.363 --> 01:22:50.295
Yes, yes.

1548
01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:51.795
Open the gate now!

1549
01:22:59.006 --> 01:22:59.700
Close the gate immediately!!

1550
01:22:59.807 --> 01:23:01.832
Open it, close it, make up your mind...

1551
01:23:01.942 --> 01:23:03.170
All together now!

1552
01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:16.646
You did it daddy, you did it!

1553
01:23:16.757 --> 01:23:19.920
You are now the uncontested Master
of all the Kingdoms!!

1554
01:23:20.027 --> 01:23:23.087
Heaven knows,
I don't care about titles and honors...

1555
01:23:23.197 --> 01:23:26.963
But I must admit that it does
feel good to be Supreme Ruler.

1556
01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:28.433
Let us prepare ourselves.

1557
01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:33.305
The gate looks as if it will hold.

1558
01:23:33.407 --> 01:23:34.271
Not for long

1559
01:23:34.375 --> 01:23:35.706
Oh, my children!

1560
01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:36.538
Papa!

1561
01:23:36.644 --> 01:23:37.611
Daddy!

1562
01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:39.911
We missed you, Papa.

1563
01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:44.108
Oh, my children, what a joy it is
to have you back safe and sound!

1564
01:24:04.338 --> 01:24:05.498
What's wrong?

1565
01:24:07.341 --> 01:24:09.741
No, the phone's cut off,
it doesn't work.

1566
01:24:10.077 --> 01:24:11.339
What is wrong?!

1567
01:24:11.912 --> 01:24:13.243
Out... Out there!!

1568
01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:15.045
- What's out there?
- Five!!

1569
01:24:15.282 --> 01:24:17.216
- Five what?
- Black!!

1570
01:24:17.651 --> 01:24:19.744
- What are you talking about?
- Huge!!!

1571
01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:21.111
Where're you going?

1572
01:24:21.222 --> 01:24:22.712
Don't leave me here,
no Granny please!!!

1573
01:24:26.427 --> 01:24:30.420
It's noon! In one minute!

1574
01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:34.067
Hurry now,
you only have one minute.

1575
01:24:34.735 --> 01:24:37.033
We can only hold the water back
for about an hour

1576
01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:38.730
but I know that I can depend on you

1577
01:24:38.839 --> 01:24:42.366
After all, you're one of us now and I hope
you know that you're always welcome back here

1578
01:24:42.476 --> 01:24:43.443
Ah!

1579
01:24:43.544 --> 01:24:46.069
And a second turn of
the wheel for the spirit...

1580
01:24:47.381 --> 01:24:49.110
Our lives are in your hands, my friend.

1581
01:24:49.216 --> 01:24:50.581
We're counting on you and your grandson.

1582
01:24:50.684 --> 01:24:53.812
Don't worry. Arthur has a plan
and I'm sure it's gonna work.

1583
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:58.354
It's going to pretty dull
around here without you!

1584
01:24:58.459 --> 01:24:59.289
Come back soon, huh?

1585
01:24:59.393 --> 01:25:01.293
At the tenth moon, that's a promise.

1586
01:25:01.395 --> 01:25:03.295
He, he, he... Ha!

1587
01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:08.167
Ten moons, that gives us plenty of time

1588
01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:11.102
to put our desire to the test
and respect the protocol!

1589
01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:13.263
To hell with the protocol!

1590
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:18.471
And a third turn of
the wheel for the soul.

1591
01:25:37.431 --> 01:25:38.523
See you...

1592
01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.526
ten moons!

1593
01:25:47.107 --> 01:25:48.039
Thank you!

1594
01:25:48.275 --> 01:25:49.674
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks!

1595
01:25:51.445 --> 01:25:52.912
Mom? Mom!

1596
01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:54.210
Mom?

1597
01:25:54.448 --> 01:25:56.507
Honey, what, get out... Wat...

1598
01:25:57.618 --> 01:25:58.676
Oh!

1599
01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:03.087
Arthur! Where have you been?

1600
01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:04.521
I was with the Minimoys.

1601
01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:06.717
- The Min... Mini what?
- The Minimoys!!

1602
01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:09.555
Ooh! Ha, ha!

1603
01:26:11.365 --> 01:26:12.389
Mom?!!

1604
01:26:12.633 --> 01:26:13.964
Granpa!

1605
01:26:14.735 --> 01:26:15.667
Are you okay?

1606
01:26:16.403 --> 01:26:17.392
My brothers!!

1607
01:26:17.504 --> 01:26:18.562
Oh...

1608
01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:20.333
I'm so glad to see you again!

1609
01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:25.778
Grandpa!! We have got no time left,
we gotta go!!

1610
01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.676
You're right...

1611
01:26:29.283 --> 01:26:31.183
Noon on the dot!

1612
01:26:31.552 --> 01:26:33.076
And no one in sight!

1613
01:26:33.554 --> 01:26:37.718
I'm afraid, though it is a beautiful Sunday,
despite it being the day of our Lord...

1614
01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:40.521
There seems to be no miracle! So...

1615
01:26:42.763 --> 01:26:43.923
You're right Davido...

1616
01:26:44.031 --> 01:26:47.000
It is a beautiful, beautiful Sunday!

1617
01:26:47.134 --> 01:26:49.432
I believe we have some papers to sign,
am I right?

1618
01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:51.829
Let's go in the living room,
we'll be more comfortable!

1619
01:26:57.478 --> 01:26:59.639
I try to buy time,
you get busy finding the treasure...

1620
01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:00.679
Ok!

1621
01:27:08.722 --> 01:27:09.552
Mino!

1622
01:27:10.024 --> 01:27:11.355
Mino, where are you?

1623
01:27:12.326 --> 01:27:13.350
Mino!

1624
01:27:13.694 --> 01:27:14.752
That's not gonna be easy!

1625
01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:21.965
Light!

1626
01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:47.357
I promised you riches and power...

1627
01:27:47.461 --> 01:27:50.021
And Malthazar
always keeps his promises.

1628
01:27:50.464 --> 01:27:52.227
Nothing can stop us now!

1629
01:27:52.566 --> 01:27:54.966
The Seven Kingdoms are... mine!

1630
01:27:57.671 --> 01:27:59.434
I mean, of course, ours...

1631
01:27:59.873 --> 01:28:01.067
BRAVO!

1632
01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:04.072
What?

1633
01:28:04.478 --> 01:28:08.539
Excuse me, could you tell me
what time it is, I'm kinda far-sighted.

1634
01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:11.151
Noon!

1635
01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:12.384
Thank you!

1636
01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:14.521
My fearless and faithful warriors!

1637
01:28:14.621 --> 01:28:16.851
Let the festivities begin.

1638
01:28:21.996 --> 01:28:23.224
Now if I do the exact opposite,

1639
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:26.197
the light which reflects downwards
should then reflect...

1640
01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:27.324
upwards!

1641
01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:36.968
Mino! You're the best.

1642
01:28:39.446 --> 01:28:40.140
What that...

1643
01:28:40.247 --> 01:28:41.874
What is he doing? Darkos!!?

1644
01:28:41.982 --> 01:28:43.449
That idiot will give our position away!

1645
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:44.881
Make him cut that beam immediately!

1646
01:28:44.985 --> 01:28:45.781
Cut the beam!!!

1647
01:28:45.886 --> 01:28:46.545
Huh? Oh...

1648
01:28:46.653 --> 01:28:49.281
Sorry, because I'm far sighted,
but I'm also hard of hearing!

1649
01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:52.848
You fool! You will be sorry
that you defied Malthazar!

1650
01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:01.028
Oh, it's nothing, really!

1651
01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:02.397
Bring him here!

1652
01:29:02.669 --> 01:29:04.136
W, w, w, watch out!
I can get really nasty!

1653
01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:04.932
Ha! Ha!

1654
01:29:05.039 --> 01:29:07.166
Sure you can... Come on, show us!!!

1655
01:29:23.857 --> 01:29:25.484
What is this thing???

1656
01:29:25.592 --> 01:29:26.524
I know, I know...

1657
01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:28.959
Oh gracious Lord, it's a kind of...

1658
01:29:49.483 --> 01:29:50.882
Oh... water...

1659
01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:52.581
Dady?

1660
01:29:52.686 --> 01:29:54.984
- They blocked the pipe!
- Damn!

1661
01:29:55.122 --> 01:29:56.953
Father! What shall I do?

1662
01:30:02.596 --> 01:30:03.494
What about me, father?

1663
01:30:03.597 --> 01:30:04.825
As for you, my son...

1664
01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:08.698
I hereby solemnly appoint you
Commander of the lmperial Forces!

1665
01:30:08.802 --> 01:30:10.963
Oh... Thank you, father, that's nice but...

1666
01:30:11.071 --> 01:30:13.369
You wouldn't have a place left on
that mosquito of yours, would you?!

1667
01:30:13.474 --> 01:30:16.170
A Commander never deserts his post...!

1668
01:30:18.679 --> 01:30:21.170
Father... Daddy!?

1669
01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.078
Mino?

1670
01:30:32.025 --> 01:30:33.117
Yes!

1671
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.058
More coffee?

1672
01:30:41.168 --> 01:30:41.600
No!

1673
01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:43.033
No more coffee! Thank you!

1674
01:30:43.137 --> 01:30:45.332
But what I would love is
for you to sign the paper!

1675
01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:47.964
Of course, what did I do with my pen?

1676
01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:51.809
Oh, what a lovely pen!

1677
01:30:51.912 --> 01:30:53.573
We have wasted enough time.

1678
01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:54.476
Sign!

1679
01:30:54.581 --> 01:30:55.809
Of course.

1680
01:31:01.588 --> 01:31:02.520
And now...

1681
01:31:04.224 --> 01:31:05.282
The money!

1682
01:31:05.792 --> 01:31:06.486
Unh?

1683
01:31:06.793 --> 01:31:08.420
Oh! The money, yes!!

1684
01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:11.123
I'd like to see how you're going
to pull one of your tricks now!

1685
01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:12.326
Here!

1686
01:31:14.801 --> 01:31:16.860
Bravo my boy!

1687
01:31:21.842 --> 01:31:23.173
So then...

1688
01:31:23.911 --> 01:31:26.539
Good accounts make for good friends,
isn't that right?

1689
01:31:27.414 --> 01:31:31.111
There you are, paid in full!

1690
01:31:37.724 --> 01:31:40.659
Sir, I must now be saying goodbye!

1691
01:31:41.061 --> 01:31:41.925
Good bye now.

1692
01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:43.390
Good bye!

1693
01:31:52.105 --> 01:31:55.165
Ha! Ha! Ha! Congratulations!

1694
01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:57.672
Nobody move! I said!

1695
01:32:05.519 --> 01:32:08.113
So that's why you had
your sights set on this land?

1696
01:32:08.222 --> 01:32:11.214
Of course! The call of greed,
now and forever!

1697
01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:14.055
One night you had a few too many
and you told me about this treasure

1698
01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:16.425
and ever since I have not
had a good night's sleep!

1699
01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:18.623
But now, it's mine!

1700
01:32:18.732 --> 01:32:20.324
Thanks kid! Nice job!

1701
01:32:20.634 --> 01:32:24.331
Well, I'll be saying my farewells,
you won't be seeing me ever again!

1702
01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:28.465
Because I am going far, far away!

1703
01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:32.278
You're coming with me! C'mon!

1704
01:32:33.247 --> 01:32:35.943
Get your hands off me. I know the govenor!

1705
01:32:40.287 --> 01:32:42.016
Oh, I'll take that. I'll take that.

1706
01:32:42.122 --> 01:32:44.249
Next time, please put
your gift in a safer place.

1707
01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:44.915
That's a promise.

1708
01:32:45.025 --> 01:32:48.051
I'll take it. It's much safer with me.

1709
01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:13.518
Don't worry Mino,
I'm gonna take care of you.

1710
01:33:22.262 --> 01:33:23.422
They did it!!

1711
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:24.827
Yes! They did it!!

1712
01:33:24.931 --> 01:33:25.625
They made it!!

1713
01:33:25.732 --> 01:33:28.428
My daughter. My son.

1714
01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:30.898
Oh, boy.

1715
01:33:35.375 --> 01:33:38.037
How I would have loved
my little Mino to see this!

1716
01:33:38.345 --> 01:33:41.712
I understand Miro,
but our people are safe and sound...

1717
01:33:41.815 --> 01:33:43.806
and that is something
to be thankful for.

1718
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:45.281
Of course, of course.

1719
01:33:52.959 --> 01:33:55.792
Wait, I think I know what it is...

1720
01:33:58.598 --> 01:33:59.724
Hey! It's Mino!

1721
01:33:59.933 --> 01:34:01.730
Mino, my son!

1722
01:34:01.835 --> 01:34:02.767
Papa!!

1723
01:34:02.936 --> 01:34:04.403
Oh, my boy.

1724
01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:08.738
Well, there you go!

1725
01:34:08.842 --> 01:34:10.173
All's well that ends well!

1726
01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:11.437
Not quite...

1727
01:34:14.281 --> 01:34:15.179
May I?

1728
01:34:52.252 --> 01:34:53.844
I think it's ready...
Excuse me...

1729
01:35:02.095 --> 01:35:03.892
I propose a toast!

1730
01:35:03.997 --> 01:35:05.658
Here, here!

1731
01:35:05.832 --> 01:35:07.231
Here it comes!

1732
01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:10.862
What is that?

1733
01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:13.997
My favorite dish!! African giraffe's neck!

1734
01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:16.041
Oh! Archibald!

1735
01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:17.110
What?

1736
01:35:18.612 --> 01:35:20.603
Honey! Honey! Rosie!

1737
01:35:21.047 --> 01:35:21.877
I was only kidding!

1738
01:35:21.982 --> 01:35:24.280
Rosie! Rosie! Wake up, honey!!

1739
01:35:24.384 --> 01:35:27.649
Every time she gets a little excited,
over she goes!

1740
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:31.184
Where's Arthur?

1741
01:35:31.758 --> 01:35:33.055
Euh, he...

1742
01:35:33.393 --> 01:35:36.021
He just went to wash up.
He'll be back in a jiffy!

1743
01:35:51.077 --> 01:35:53.705
Only ten more moons, Selenia...

1744
01:36:09.663 --> 01:36:11.130
I will wait for you.
