1
00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:01.842
No!

2
00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:03.677
Come on!

3
00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.283
Come on, baby.

4
00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:25.203
Grab it!

5
00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.585
All right.

6
00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:42.849
What?

7
00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:48.518
Ow!

8
00:01:58.035 --> 00:01:59.400
Vincent.

9
00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:03.075
No, no, bad idea.
Bad idea!

10
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.281
Hmm?

11
00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.993
Just take what you need.

12
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.697
Just take what you need.

13
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.494
Mmm-hmm.

14
00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:49.719
What's...

15
00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.607
Mmm.

16
00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:16.829
Huh?

17
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.006
RJ?
No?

18
00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.549
The moon's not full.

19
00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.719
You woke me up a week early?

20
00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.390
Oh, no.

21
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:37.896
Don't tell me you're dumb enough
to actually try and steal my stuff.

22
00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.395
RJ, I'm gonna have to kill you.

23
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.198
Please, I'm just a desperate
guy trying to feed his family.

24
00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:47.159
You don't have a family.
I meant a family of one.

25
00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.780
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Look, it's still in the cave.

26
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.240
So, technically, not stolen.

27
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.950
Oh, no!

28
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:57.661
No!

29
00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:03.501
Slow!
Slow!

30
00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:07.004
Stop!

31
00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.924
Whew!

32
00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.759
That was close.

33
00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:21.227
Vincent, wait! I
can get it all back!

34
00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:25.280
That's right! If you eat me,
you'd have to do it.

35
00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:26.949
But I can get it. All of it!

36
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.367
My red wagon?
Redder!

37
00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:30.615
Ow.

38
00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.747
The blue cooler?
Blue cooler. On my list!

39
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.490
Gotta be blue?
Yes!

40
00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.247
And I want my Spuddies.
I love those things.

41
00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:42.373
'Cause with a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.

42
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.209
So true. Painfully true.
And I'll tell you what.

43
00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.840
I'm gonna get you the giant
picnic pack, family-fun size.

44
00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:50.673
They have that?
I'm pretty sure.

45
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:55.094
All right, RJ. I'm going back to sleep.

46
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.813
When that moon is full, I'm waking up.

47
00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:02.644
And all my stuff had better be
right back where it was.

48
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.146
But that's just one week!
That's impossible for one guy!

49
00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.315
A week's perfect.
I'll get some helpers.

50
00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:12.953
Full moon, all my stuff. And don't
even think about running away.

51
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.704
Because if you do, I will hunt
you down and kill you.

52
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:24.840
Okay! Okay, buddy! You just
rest easy, all right, 'cause I'm on it.

53
00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:29.633
Hey, in a week from now, we're
gonna be laughing about this thing.

72
00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:09.319
The one place I didn't have a shell.

73
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.869
Wow.

74
00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:30.879
Spring.

75
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.628
That means there's only
274 days left till winter.

76
00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.839
Everybody, wake up!
Hibernation's over.

77
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.173
Morning!

78
00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.600
Morning, Hammy.
I gotta go wee-wee!

79
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.936
Not in the lake we drink from!

80
00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.890
Let's go, all right,
the rest of you. It's spring!

81
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.937
That means we gotta get to work.

82
00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.440
Finished. No, wait!

83
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.943
Come on, everybody. Wake up.
Don't make me come in there.

84
00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:55.357
Y'all better listen.

85
00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.489
I've been holding something in all winter,

86
00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.320
and I'm about to let it out.

87
00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.744
I'm up, I'm up!
She means it. Let's go!

88
00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.162
Thank you, Stella.

89
00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:07.498
I can clear a room, Verne.
Come on, that much I can do.

90
00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.876
Good morning.
Good morning, everyone!

91
00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:13.004
How'd you guys sleep?
Just a super-duper morning.

92
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.634
Jeepers.

93
00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.759
Not lookin' so good
around the eyes there, hon.

94
00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:20.348
Bucky and Quillo were up
every three or four weeks.

95
00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:21.721
And Spike kept poking me.

96
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.848
Yeah. Well, he's kinda pokey.

97
00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:25.804
Yup, he's the sharpest of the bunch there.

98
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.231
You know what? How 'bout
I take the day shift?

99
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.108
Lou, that'd be just super.

100
00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.731
All right, kids, you heard your mother,

101
00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.404
and now, you listen to me.
Shape up there.

102
00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:37.362
Oh, boy.

103
00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.359
This is what I was afraid of.

104
00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.738
Where's the food? Is there any left?
I'm really hungry, so is there any left?

105
00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.370
We ate all the food, Hammy.
During the winter?

106
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.871
So, we gotta go get some more now.

107
00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.753
Right! I buried some nuts in the woods,

108
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.206
and I know where they are.
I'll be right back. Bye!

109
00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.387
Dad, it was just snow.

110
00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.677
But it could have been a predator.

111
00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:04.135
Isn't playing dead a little weak?

112
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.470
Heather, how many times
must I say it?

113
00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.352
Playing possum is what we do.

114
00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.683
We die so that we live!

115
00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:14.523
Kids, I'm the boss of you,
okay? So just calm down.

116
00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.355
That's what we need to find
you this year, don't you know?

117
00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.735
A good fella.

118
00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:21.239
A good fella? A good fella?
Uh-oh. Jeepers, here we go.

119
00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.491
Why does everyone think I need a man?

120
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.868
I look like a nest
and smell like a swamp.

121
00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.333
So, when you find a fella who's decent,

122
00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:31.537
good with kids and has
no sense of smell, call me.

123
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.472
Hello?
I don't care who started it.

124
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.806
Uh...

125
00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:45.642
Look, food.

126
00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:49.055
Well, I think you know
what this means.

127
00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.268
Verne.
Just a minute, Hammy.

128
00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:55.402
This means we were nine
berries away from starvation.

129
00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.817
Sorry.
That was a little intense.

130
00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:00.357
I meant, really serious hunger pains.

131
00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:02.237
Verne!

132
00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:05.286
Not finished, Hammy.
Morning, Lou, Penny.

133
00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.330
Thanks.
Hey, kids.

134
00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:09.454
So, what I want to
tell you all is... Verne!

135
00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:12.332
I'm not done, Hammy. If
you have to go again, just go.

136
00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.627
Okay. So, all I'm saying
is we cut it a little close.

137
00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.334
So, this year we need to make
sure that we fill the log...

138
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:21.928
All the way to the top.
Exactly. All the way to the top.

139
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.222
Because, what are we?
Foragers!

140
00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.176
- And what do we forage?
- Food!

141
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.637
Right.
Super, Verne, really super.

142
00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.639
Okay, Hammy.
Huh?

143
00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.189
What is it?
What is what?

144
00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:34.607
What is it you want
to tell me?

145
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.560
Mmm? Oh. Uh. Oh!

146
00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.861
What was it, what was it,
what was it, what was it?

147
00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:41.110
Wait. Right on the tip
of my tongue. Yeah!

148
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.317
There's a weird thing over
there I've never seen before.

149
00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.652
It's really scary. Follow me.

150
00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:50.958
Okay. Meeting called on
account of weird, scary thing.

151
00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.205
Let's go.

152
00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.795
Hmm. Foragers.

153
00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.799
Hammy, what weird thing?

154
00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:00.876
Oh.

155
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.591
That weird thing.

156
00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.075
It never ends!

157
00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.082
Whoa!

158
00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:38.580
Hey!

159
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.167
It never ends that way too!

160
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.511
Jeepers, Lou.

161
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.383
Yeah, jeepers
is the word there, hon.

162
00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.599
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Man, that's big.

163
00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.222
What is this thing?
Heather, no!

164
00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:57.850
I'm scared.
Me too, Mama.

165
00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:01.570
It's okay, it's
just a... What is this thing, Lou?

166
00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.739
I... Well, it's
a... It's... Verne?

167
00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.575
Well, it's, it's obviously...

168
00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:09.527
Some kind of bush?

169
00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.034
I'd be less afraid of it if I
just knew what it was called.

170
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.119
Let's call it Steve!
Steve?

171
00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.288
It's a pretty name.
Steve sounds nice.

172
00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.086
Yeah, I'm a lot less scared of Steve.

173
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:21.172
Great and powerful Steve!

174
00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:24.380
- What do you want?
- I don't think it can speak.

175
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.676
I heard that, young man!

176
00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.635
You get over here right now!
Okay.

177
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.049
Hammy, get back here.

178
00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:33.847
But, Steve is angry! It came
from the other side of Steve.

179
00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.600
I mean the bush.
I mean... Jeez!

180
00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:42.019
Look, there's only one way we're
gonna find out what this thing is,

181
00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:44.901
and what this is all about.
I'm gonna go check it out.

182
00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:48.825
Aah!

183
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:51.073
Ay yai yai.

184
00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.367
Uh... Aah!

185
00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.578
Steve ate Verne!

186
00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:59.586
All right, Steve,
you brought this on yourself.

187
00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:03.256
Stella, don't! I'm not eaten,
I just tripped.

188
00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:08.594
I'm gonna go over there.
Just don't anybody move.

189
00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.896
Kids, come on, hurry up! You'll be late!

190
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.943
Gary, come on, breakfast!

191
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.411
What is this place?

192
00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:50.545
Hey there, little...

193
00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:52.930
Fella?

194
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:56.976
Oh !

195
00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.139
Hi.

196
00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:02.724
Aah!

197
00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.142
Oh!

198
00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.736
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

199
00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:16.530
Ow.

200
00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:25.839
Whoa! Ohh!

201
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.426
<i>Operator. Can I help you?</i>

202
00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.726
No, I can talk. I'm just
driving.

203
00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.608
Aaah!

204
00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:57.654
Verne's back.
Verne's back.

205
00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:58.783
Verne!
Jeepers!

206
00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.616
- Come on, let's get him.
- Help him up.

207
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.327
What was over there?
Freaky pink primates!

208
00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.253
They must have come
while we were hibernating.

209
00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:06.542
It was awful.

210
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.339
They had wheels on their feet,

211
00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:09.791
and these sticks, and they were

212
00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:13.095
whacking me with these sticks
like it was some sort of sick game.

213
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:16.840
You should have died ! You
should have laid down and died.

214
00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:18.887
Dad.
That's not the worst part.

215
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:20.517
Half the forest is gone.

216
00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:23.930
The oak trees, and the berry bushes,

217
00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.650
they're just...
they're just gone.

218
00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.401
Jeepers.

219
00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:29.985
What'll we do for food?

220
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:31.988
How are we gonna live?

221
00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:36.489
I don't know.
But here's what I do know.

222
00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:40.493
We will be fine as long as
no one goes over Steve again.

223
00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:44.872
It's called a hedge, and it is not
to be feared, my amphibious friend.

224
00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.837
It is the gateway to the good life.

225
00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.503
I'm a reptile, actually.

226
00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:52.633
But, you know, it's a common mistake.

227
00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.298
And you are?

228
00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:57.639
Where are my manners. I'm RJ.

229
00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.382
Please don't think I'm prying,

230
00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.093
but I couldn't help overhearing,

231
00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.769
and I can shed a little light

232
00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:05.096
on what this whole
hedge situation is about.

233
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.565
You see, what was once mere wilderness

234
00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:12.271
is now 54 acres of man-made,
manicured, air-conditioned paradise.

235
00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:15.490
Except for that little-bitty
speck. You are here.

236
00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:19.239
No, no, that's a good thing.
You're hibernators, right?

237
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.537
You gather up a bunch of food,
store it away for the winter?

238
00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.744
- Uh-huh. We fill the log !
- Hammy.

239
00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:26.747
Really? This log?
This cave-like log?

240
00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:29.078
All the way to the top.
Ozzie.

241
00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:31.748
Let me ask ya, how long's it take?

242
00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:35.260
You know, to fill the log? Two
hundred and seventy-four days.

243
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:36.586
Oh!

244
00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.005
Ever done it in a week?
That's impossible.

245
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.386
Not if we work together.

246
00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:43.514
You see, you've got the food
gathering skills, I've got the know-how,

247
00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:45.595
and they have the food !
How much food?

248
00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:49.190
Loads of food. Heaps of food.
Food out the wazoo!

249
00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:52.185
Well, you know, whatever kind
of food comes out of a wazoo,

250
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.112
I really don't think
we're interested in eating.

251
00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.485
I don't know, the guy's making
a lot of sense to me.

252
00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:59.739
I think we should listen. Yeah,
I'm okay with wazoo food there.

253
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.578
No, you're not.
The tail is tingling.

254
00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:06.165
Why didn't you say so? Hold
on, hold on. The what is what?

255
00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.582
When something doesn't feel right,
my tail tingles. Let me tell you something,

256
00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:12.380
everything you've said so far
is driving my tail crazy.

257
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.509
Listen. Verne, right? This isn't
something you need to be afraid of.

258
00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:19.595
Well, I am.
And for good reason.

259
00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.381
This is not a birthmark.

260
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.304
That's because you went over
there without a guide, Verne.

261
00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:26.890
Whatever. Thanks for stopping
by. We're not interested.

262
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:30.394
Not interested in the most
delicious food you've ever tasted?

263
00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:31.645
No!
Come on.

264
00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:34.148
Not interested!

265
00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:37.188
Okay. I get it.

266
00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:38.815
I understand.

267
00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:42.118
This is something that
you're just not open to.

268
00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:46.240
Wow!

269
00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:52.044
Whoa!

270
00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:53.997
My!
Jeepers.

271
00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.208
What is that?

272
00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.090
That, my friend, is a magical
combination of corn flour,

273
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:04.050
dehydrated cheese solids,
BHA, BHT and good old MSG,

274
00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:07.352
a.k.a. the chip. Nacho cheese flavor.

275
00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:11.139
Over here! Toss me one of
those! More, please! More.

276
00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:13.395
Yeah, Verne, those were good!

277
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:16.152
It's all good. And we're going
over there. Tonight!

278
00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:18.153
Yeah!

279
00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:21.778
Welcome to Suburbia.

280
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.610
Look at that!

281
00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:29.244
Hey, Mom, look at us!
Look at us!

282
00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:32.290
My! Hon, look at this.

283
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.086
Jeepers.

284
00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:35.462
How's that tail, Verne?

285
00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.882
Listen, if anybody
in this family gets hurt,

286
00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:40.084
I'm holding you personally responsible.

287
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:41.465
They're having a good time.

288
00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:43.296
I'll take responsibility for that.

289
00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.722
This is neat.
Look at that.

290
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.016
Hey, Spike, look at that.

291
00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:49.094
Hey, Verno, I took a few clippings

292
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.929
out of my quills
to do a little comparison.

293
00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:54.436
Look at this, the grass
seems to be greener over here.

294
00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:57.110
Verne, are you certain
you came to the same place?

295
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.937
Yeah, 'cause the raccoon says...

296
00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:01.318
Okay, enough about him.
I get it.

297
00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:02.524
So, he can do a couple of tricks.

298
00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:05.155
I mean, it's not like he can walk on water.

299
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.487
Hey, everybody!
This way to the food!

300
00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:12.040
That thing's huge!
What is that?

301
00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:15.246
That is an SUV.
Humans ride around in it

302
00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:18.172
because they are slowly
losing their ability to walk.

303
00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:21.547
Jeepers, it's so big !
How many humans fit in there?

304
00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.503
Usually? One.

305
00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:27.845
Hi, this is Gladys Sharp.
Your president?

306
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.097
Of the homeowner's association? Right.

307
00:20:30.187 --> 00:20:31.598
Jeepers.
What is that?

308
00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:34.932
Easy, easy, don't worry.
That's just a human being.

309
00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:37.809
And they are just as scared
of us as we are of them.

310
00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:41.146
Now, if a human does happen
to see you, just lay down,

311
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.323
roll over and give your privates
a good licking. They love it.

312
00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:46.947
The homeowner's charter,
which you signed,

313
00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:48.778
says the grass is supposed to be two inches,

314
00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:52.032
and according to my
measuring stick, yours is 2.5.

315
00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:54.500
Could we just get the food and go?

316
00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.419
Really, do they have it, or not?

317
00:20:56.714 --> 00:20:57.704
Didn't you see it?

318
00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:00.586
It was in the box. They've
always got food with them.

319
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:04.089
We eat to live, these guys live to eat.

320
00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:06.675
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

321
00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:09.219
<i>The human mouth is called a "pie hole."</i>

322
00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:11.935
The human being is called a "couch potato."

323
00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:14.513
That is a device to summon food.

324
00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:17.811
That is one of the many voices of food.

325
00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:20.518
That is the portal
for the passing of the food.

326
00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:23.943
That is one of the many
food transportation vehicles.

327
00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.357
Humans bring the food, take the food,

328
00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:28.910
ship the food, they drive the food,

329
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.452
they wear the food!

330
00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:33.076
That gets the food hot.
That keeps the food cold.

331
00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:35.283
That... I'm not sure what that is.

332
00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:36.493
Aah!

333
00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:37.577
Aah!

334
00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:39.504
What do you know? Food!

335
00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:43.250
That is the altar where they worship food.

336
00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:45.922
That's what they eat when
they've eaten too much food.

337
00:21:46.013 --> 00:21:48.596
That gets rid of the guilt
so they can eat more food.

338
00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:51.595
Food ! Food ! Food ! Food!

339
00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:53.141
Food!

340
00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:55.470
So, you think they have enough?

341
00:21:56.524 --> 00:22:00.358
Well, they don't. For humans,
enough is never enough!

342
00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:04.146
And what do they do
with the stuff they don't eat?

343
00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:08.487
They put it in gleaming, silver cans,

344
00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:09.943
just for us.

345
00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:14.614
Sweet jeepers.

346
00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:15.865
Dig in!

347
00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:20.753
Good, isn't it?
Okay.

348
00:22:21.924 --> 00:22:24.666
Share there, everyone, share.
Come on, come on, come on.

349
00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:30.388
That's a diaper. And that
does come out of a wazoo.

350
00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:35.260
So, what do you think?
Was I right or was I right?

351
00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:37.470
And these things are just the scraps!

352
00:22:37.565 --> 00:22:39.021
Wait'll you see what comes in the boxes,

353
00:22:39.108 --> 00:22:40.519
and packages and cans!

354
00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:43.271
I'm telling you, folks, stick
with me, and in one week

355
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:45.694
we will gather enough food to...

356
00:22:45.948 --> 00:22:48.110
To feed a bear.
What?

357
00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:49.823
Just a figure of speech.

358
00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:56.743
Halt! Intruders! Intruders!
Get out, all of you.

359
00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.453
What is it, baby?

360
00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:02.753
What are you doing?
You said we should lick our...

361
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.831
No! Nix that! Run!

362
00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:07.175
Run ! Run !
Get outta here!

363
00:23:07.261 --> 00:23:08.251
Run!

364
00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:10.969
- Shoo!
- To the hedge!

365
00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:13.844
Get out of here!
I just mopped this patio!

366
00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:15.549
Filthy vermin!

367
00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:22.182
Verne's right, that was horrible.

368
00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:24.184
You kids okay? Hon, you
all right there? Stay close.

369
00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:25.484
We'll find other food, right?

370
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:27.938
See what I mean? That's
what I was talking about.

371
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:30.148
These humans don't want us around.

372
00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:33.405
So, we scared her, and
she overreacted. No biggie.

373
00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:36.578
No biggie? That is what we call a biggie.

374
00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:38.247
Come on, think about the food.

375
00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:39.790
It was worth it
for that food, huh?

376
00:23:39.877 --> 00:23:41.459
That stuff is to die for!

377
00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:44.999
Let me rephrase that.

378
00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:47.840
No, to die for.
You nailed that part.

379
00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:52.049
Look, maybe our little forest life
looks primitive to a guy with a bag.

380
00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:53.629
What?
But I think I speak

381
00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:56.432
for the whole family
when I say we want nothing

382
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.018
to do with anything
that's over that hedge.

383
00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:02.646
- Come on !
- I'm done.

384
00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:06.146
You haven't even tried doughnuts
yet! You wanna store fat?

385
00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:07.977
That is the way to store some fat.

386
00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:10.400
You'll be sweatin' through the winter!

387
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:12.073
We'll eat the bark, right?

388
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:14.526
Okay, all right, you guys sleep on it!

389
00:24:14.954 --> 00:24:17.696
Good idea. I'm gonna check back with you.

390
00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.327
Shoot!

391
00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:23.371
Almost had 'em.

392
00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:31.842
- Good night, Heather.
- Good night, Verne.

393
00:24:32.096 --> 00:24:33.507
- Good night, Ozzie.
- Good night, Verne.

394
00:24:33.597 --> 00:24:35.008
- Good night, Lou.
- Yeah, good night there, Verne.

395
00:24:35.182 --> 00:24:36.764
- Night, Penny.
- Good night, Verne.

396
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.386
- Good night, Hammy.
- Good night, Verne.

397
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:39.808
- Good night, Bucky.
- Good night.

398
00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:41.806
- Good night, Spike.
- Good night, Uncle Verne.

399
00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:43.683
- Good night, Quillo.
- Good night, Uncle Verne.

400
00:24:43.774 --> 00:24:46.562
Remember, when we
wake up, only 273 days left till winter.

401
00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:49.735
- That's enough, Verne.
- Good night, 273.

402
00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:54.315
Spuddies...

403
00:24:54.702 --> 00:24:58.320
Cooler... Wagon... Redder wagon.

404
00:24:59.665 --> 00:25:01.576
Time's up, RJ.

405
00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:04.041
But I have six more days! No!

406
00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:05.792
No!

407
00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:11.374
Okay. Four paws, fur.

408
00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:13.835
Still alive, still alive.

409
00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:17.258
What are you saying?
You want me to take 'em to his house?

410
00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:19.090
- No.
- Then what are you saying?

411
00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:20.970
Jimmy was pushing me on the bus.

412
00:25:21.228 --> 00:25:23.469
- He likes you.
- No way, he's a creep.

413
00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:25.680
Next time he shoves you, beat him up.

414
00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:27.397
Yes!

415
00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:35.026
Okay, kids, dive in. There
it is. Bark for breakfast!

416
00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:38.242
I want a doughnut!
I want pizza.

417
00:25:38.579 --> 00:25:39.785
No, you don't.

418
00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:59.088
Okay. This is great.

419
00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:08.097
Granted, it takes
some time to chew.

420
00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:09.603
But that...

421
00:26:11.153 --> 00:26:13.019
That was very satisfying.

422
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:16.398
And, by the way,
lots of fiber in there too.

423
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:17.861
Mmm!

424
00:26:18.535 --> 00:26:22.073
Lots. I gotta admit, that does look tasty.

425
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.280
What are you doing here?

426
00:26:24.374 --> 00:26:27.366
I'm here to help you
with your foraging thing.

427
00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:29.876
Look, Verne,

428
00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:32.876
you said a word yesterday
about your little gang here.

429
00:26:33.092 --> 00:26:35.049
It starts with an F,
do you remember what it was?

430
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.461
Family?
Right, right, that.

431
00:26:38.555 --> 00:26:40.387
You know, that got me right here.

432
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:42.761
You see, Verne, I used to have all of that.

433
00:26:42.893 --> 00:26:46.386
My own place, surrounded by loved ones,

434
00:26:46.647 --> 00:26:48.229
universal remote.

435
00:26:48.524 --> 00:26:50.231
But then all that went away with...

436
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.566
The weed hacker incident.

437
00:26:53.028 --> 00:26:54.018
Oh, God.

438
00:26:54.988 --> 00:26:56.194
Come here.

439
00:26:57.157 --> 00:26:59.489
Yeah, that feels good, doesn't it?

440
00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:01.942
Oh, brother.
Jeepers, Verne.

441
00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:04.278
We could always use the
extra hand there, you know.

442
00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:07.790
The weed hacker, Verne.
The weed hacker.

443
00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:10.451
Okay.

444
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:13.121
Not your problem.
I'll just go.

445
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.915
This is me...

446
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.795
Going.

447
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.006
Been nice.
Don't hit.

448
00:27:20.097 --> 00:27:21.508
Really nice getting to know you.

449
00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:24.049
Hey, I'm sure I'll see you
around the forest.

450
00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:26.433
Take care.
All right, all right.

451
00:27:26.979 --> 00:27:28.140
Hey, RJ?

452
00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:31.518
You can...
you can stay.

453
00:27:32.943 --> 00:27:34.650
- Come here, ya big lug !
- No.

454
00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:36.943
I knew beneath this hard, crispy outside

455
00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.067
there was a soft, nougat-y center in there.

456
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:40.694
Do you mind if I call you Uncle Verne?

457
00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:42.991
With every bone in my body.

458
00:27:43.162 --> 00:27:44.948
Great. Hey, can I work with Hammy?

459
00:27:46.415 --> 00:27:47.905
You wanna help me find my nuts?

460
00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:50.370
Very tempting, Hammy, very tempting.

461
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.747
But first, I want to show you this.

462
00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:55.254
You like this cookie?

463
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.626
Ohh, ho, ho, ho!

464
00:27:56.717 --> 00:27:59.254
Well, this cookie's junk!
I like a cookie.

465
00:27:59.553 --> 00:28:00.964
Easy, easy. Don't worry.

466
00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:03.170
I know where we can get
some cookies so valuable

467
00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:06.633
that they are hand delivered
by uniformed officers.

468
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.057
And the Doyles' is the yellow
house. They only ordered one box.

469
00:28:11.148 --> 00:28:13.606
And there they are.
America's most coveted cookies.

470
00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:17.895
Love Handles, Skinny Mints,
Neener Neeners, and Smackeroons.

471
00:28:17.988 --> 00:28:19.649
And guess what?
They're all yours!

472
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.401
Hoo-hoo! Aah!

473
00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:24.067
Whoa, Hamilton.
Hold on there, fella.

474
00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:26.160
I love your energy,
but you just can't take 'em.

475
00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:28.203
But, you said they're mine.
They will be,

476
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:32.500
if we successfully marry your
manic energy to my brilliant plan.

477
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:34.452
You with me, kid?
I... I... I...

478
00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:36.162
The I's have it!
Let's ride.

479
00:28:36.298 --> 00:28:39.040
I thought Mrs.
Johansson was allergic to chocolate.

480
00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:40.883
Really?
Yeah, if she eats it,

481
00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:44.883
her face like, explodes or
something. That is, like, so unfair.

482
00:28:45.098 --> 00:28:47.180
- Wait, wait. How many boxes of... - Hey!

483
00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:49.383
You stay away from those
cookies. They're mine!

484
00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:51.385
Ahem !
Aah!

485
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.188
Hey, this guy's not coming, is
he? I don't want him to.

486
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.982
We have so much work to do.

487
00:28:57.236 --> 00:28:59.728
Come on, step into my office.
Now, listen up.

488
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:03.530
What we're going for here is a
vicious, man-eating, rabid squirrel.

489
00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:05.570
Can you handle that?
Um. Excuse me?

490
00:29:05.661 --> 00:29:07.402
Yes... Hammy.

491
00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:11.618
Okay. Rabbits aren't vicious.
They're all cute and cuddly, so...

492
00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:14.037
Rabid, not rabbit.

493
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.876
Oh...

494
00:29:16.129 --> 00:29:17.119
What?

495
00:29:17.214 --> 00:29:18.875
Okay. So, first we're gonna
muss the hair.

496
00:29:18.966 --> 00:29:20.001
Ow, ow, ow!

497
00:29:20.092 --> 00:29:21.753
That's looking good.
All right, now we're gonna...

498
00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:24.760
We're gonna mat the fur a little bit.

499
00:29:24.846 --> 00:29:27.213
A little puff on the tail...
Stop it! Puffier.

500
00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:28.847
Liking that a lot.

501
00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:30.928
Show me that wild look
in your eye, boy. Come on!

502
00:29:32.145 --> 00:29:34.182
Oh ! Oh !
I can burp my ABCs!

503
00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:36.934
Hammy!

504
00:29:37.693 --> 00:29:40.526
I just really need you
to focus right now, okay?

505
00:29:41.363 --> 00:29:42.398
Okay.
Thank you.

506
00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:45.026
Let's see. There we...
Hang on a minute.

507
00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:47.404
Not that, not that. No, no.

508
00:29:47.494 --> 00:29:49.826
Aha! Nice!

509
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.280
Hammy?

510
00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:00.955
Done! Now, come on.
I'll be right behind you.

511
00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:03.791
Go on, get out there.
Shoo, shoo!

512
00:30:04.428 --> 00:30:08.763
I am a crazy rabid squirrel !
I want my cookies!

513
00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:11.681
I'm rabid!

514
00:30:11.768 --> 00:30:14.226
I'm foaming at the mouth.

515
00:30:14.313 --> 00:30:17.851
I'm foaming, very scary rabid squirrel.

516
00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:19.477
Rabies!
Rabies!

517
00:30:19.693 --> 00:30:21.275
Hey, it's working !
Behind you!

518
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.060
I know.
You're right behind me...

519
00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:25.855
Got it! Stand back!

520
00:30:25.949 --> 00:30:28.156
No, no, no, no! No!
Take that!

521
00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.155
Walk it off!
Walk that one off!

522
00:30:31.246 --> 00:30:32.782
What's going on?
Is that Hammy?

523
00:30:32.873 --> 00:30:34.363
Everything's under control.
Just go back to the hedge.

524
00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:35.955
You call that under control?

525
00:30:36.043 --> 00:30:37.579
He's under attack!
He's working!

526
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:40.127
- I'm coming, Hammy!
- Verne! No!

527
00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:41.999
What are you doing? Watch out!

528
00:30:49.222 --> 00:30:52.055
Hold still ! I got it! Stay
still. Help me! Get off of me!

529
00:30:53.435 --> 00:30:54.721
Yuck!
Gross!

530
00:30:55.437 --> 00:30:58.225
Nasty!
Oh, my God, this is so gross!

531
00:30:58.315 --> 00:30:59.350
Verne!

532
00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:02.858
That was great!
You, my friend, are a natural.

533
00:31:03.153 --> 00:31:06.396
Or, should I say, <i>au naturel.</i>

534
00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:08.356
Huh?

535
00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:11.525
Oh.

536
00:31:11.661 --> 00:31:14.278
Hammy, you were awesome, my man!

537
00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:18.207
You had me scared. I was about to
come out and beat you with a book myself.

538
00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:19.499
You're all right, aren't ya?

539
00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:21.827
Of course, you are.
You are Hammy!

540
00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:23.086
Those bruises are gonna heal.

541
00:31:23.173 --> 00:31:24.379
You know what?
Chicks dig scars.

542
00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:27.250
There! It was over there!
It was right over there!

543
00:31:27.344 --> 00:31:29.005
That's where the squirrel attacked us!

544
00:31:29.096 --> 00:31:30.632
He has like, rabies or something.

545
00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:33.180
There was this gross,
naked, amphibian thing.

546
00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:36.180
Reptile.
It's okay, girls.

547
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:39.307
Go inside, have a cookie,
turn on the TV and calm down.

548
00:31:39.481 --> 00:31:40.471
Thanks, Mom.

549
00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:44.354
I'm sorry, Janis, did I just
hear them say "rabid squirrel"?

550
00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:46.568
I think they might just be overreacting.

551
00:31:46.655 --> 00:31:47.770
But, what if they're not?

552
00:31:47.864 --> 00:31:50.447
What if we have a potential
pandemic on our hands?

553
00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:52.525
Vermin running loose, spreading disease,

554
00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:55.611
and lowering our property values?

555
00:31:56.373 --> 00:31:59.536
Yeah. I have a casserole
in the oven. Gotta run.

556
00:31:59.626 --> 00:32:01.833
Fine. You worry about your casserole,

557
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.208
and I'll worry about the end of
suburban peace and tranquility!

558
00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:11.335
That's right. Don't push.
Plenty for everybody.

559
00:32:11.638 --> 00:32:13.549
Got a box right over here for ya, Penny.

560
00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:15.926
Jeepers, that is good.
Kids, eat up!

561
00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:18.429
Anything that tastes this good
has to be good for you.

562
00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:20.143
You feel that buzz
in the back of your skull?

563
00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:21.762
Yeah. That's called a sugar rush.

564
00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:24.599
It's what keeps humans going,
it's why they don't hibernate.

565
00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:26.600
You top that off with a little of this,

566
00:32:26.695 --> 00:32:30.154
and what usually takes you all
summer will only take us a week.

567
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.446
I like it! I like it!

568
00:32:32.033 --> 00:32:35.446
Hold on, Hamsquad. The last
thing you need is caffeine.

569
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.156
That's right.
Come on, dig in.

570
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.992
Because this, my friends,
is just the beginning.

571
00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:44.076

- My goodness.

596
00:34:44.958 --> 00:34:46.119
Do you think it's dead?

597
00:34:46.209 --> 00:34:48.166
Oh, no!

598
00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:50.369
Wow!
Touch it.

599
00:34:50.463 --> 00:34:52.124
- Can I poke him?
- No!

600
00:34:52.215 --> 00:34:53.922
These poor little creatures.

601
00:34:54.009 --> 00:34:56.626
- What's going on?
- Come check it out.

602
00:34:56.886 --> 00:35:00.504
Debbie? I don't remember
seeing a permit out for a gathering.

603
00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:03.257
Groups of more than
one who wish to get...

604
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.847
Timmy, get the shovel from the car.

605
00:35:10.525 --> 00:35:13.608
Lights fading, limbs growing cold.

606
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.778
I see a tunnel.
Oh, no.

607
00:35:20.744 --> 00:35:24.078
Mother, is that you
beckoning me into the light?

608
00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:25.950
Must move toward the light.

609
00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:28.369
What do you think he's doing?

610
00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:30.583
Maybe we knocked his brains
loose, or something.

611
00:35:30.837 --> 00:35:32.419
I'm telling you,
you went too far this time.

612
00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:34.037
Let's get out of here, and leave this...

613
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:35.543
This...

614
00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:38.167
- Nice catch, Verne.
- Yes! Yes!

615
00:35:39.095 --> 00:35:43.259
You're dangerous. You're insane!
Sweet music, I'm going home!

616
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:48.511
Goodbye, cruel world!

617
00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:50.724
Ooh ! Ooh!

618
00:35:52.192 --> 00:35:54.103
Rosebud.

619
00:35:59.282 --> 00:36:01.523
Now can I poke him?
No!

620
00:36:01.618 --> 00:36:05.111
You see? This is exactly why
I called the exterminator.

621
00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:07.321
To kill them before
they get hurt like this.

622
00:36:07.624 --> 00:36:09.365
Everybody, get out of here right now!

623
00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:11.496
Right! Kids, grab those
handles. Get the stuff.

624
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.708
What? Here we go.
I threw out my back.

625
00:36:18.802 --> 00:36:20.292
Let's go.
Get down.

626
00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:38.644
Oh, no.

627
00:36:44.411 --> 00:36:48.200
I believe someone phoned
about an animal problem?

628
00:36:48.665 --> 00:36:51.327
The solution is
standing before you.

629
00:36:51.418 --> 00:36:54.752
Dwayne LaFontant is here.

630
00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:56.036
Where have you been?

631
00:36:56.131 --> 00:36:58.543
I'm throwing a "Welcome to the
Neighborhood" party tomorrow,

632
00:36:58.633 --> 00:37:01.671
and so far Debbie's car has
killed more animals than you have.

633
00:37:01.928 --> 00:37:03.885
Stand down, sister.

634
00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:05.678
I personally guarantee

635
00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:08.598
that there will not be
a living thing at this party.

636
00:37:09.102 --> 00:37:11.139
The Verminator is on the job.

637
00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:14.180
Leave it. Leave it!

638
00:37:14.441 --> 00:37:15.647
What do we have here?

639
00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:19.519
Didelphis marsupialis virginianus.

640
00:37:20.572 --> 00:37:21.983
Approximately 10 pounds.

641
00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:25.148
Male.

642
00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:27.781
I think he's dead.
Really?

643
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:31.205
Do you, in fact, have an
associates degree from Vermtech?

644
00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:33.282
I think he wants you to think he's dead.

645
00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:34.741
Go! Go!
Move, move!

646
00:37:34.836 --> 00:37:37.624
That's it! Run ! Go!
...voluntary shock state.

647
00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:40.248
Look at him closely.
You can see him breathing.

648
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:42.750
I certainly hope he's not in any pain.

649
00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:46.215
What the...
Kill it! Kill it!

650
00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:49.048
Thank you all for coming !
You were a great audience!

651
00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:50.845
Man!

652
00:37:52.812 --> 00:37:55.429
All right, what am I up against here?

653
00:37:56.691 --> 00:38:00.434
Possum, porcupine,
skunk, squirrel, raccoon...

654
00:38:01.863 --> 00:38:02.978
Amphibian.

655
00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:05.071
Reptile.
No.

656
00:38:06.034 --> 00:38:07.399
Reptile.

657
00:38:11.831 --> 00:38:14.414
That's what I call a
super-duper performance there.

658
00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:15.907
I wanna do it again ! Beyond super.

659
00:38:16.002 --> 00:38:18.084
They were riveted, man.
You were awesome!

660
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:20.079
All right!

661
00:38:21.049 --> 00:38:24.462
Dad. I just gotta say, that
was... that was pretty good.

662
00:38:26.346 --> 00:38:27.802
Props for the Ozman!

663
00:38:28.097 --> 00:38:30.384
Ozman !
Yeah ! Yeah!

664
00:38:30.725 --> 00:38:33.217
But let's not forget
our brilliant leadership,

665
00:38:33.436 --> 00:38:34.676
RJ.

666
00:38:34.938 --> 00:38:36.099
RJ ! RJ!

667
00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:38.100
Brilliant!

668
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:41.691
Hey, RJ, come this way.
We wanna show you something.

669
00:38:42.028 --> 00:38:44.019
Yeah, sure.
Sweet.

670
00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:46.814
What a team ! That raccoon
knows what he's doing.

671
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.282
You're my hero there, fella.

672
00:38:53.498 --> 00:38:55.364
Over here, this way.
RJ, come on!

673
00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:57.745
Yeah, we wanna show you
something. Come on, hurry!

674
00:38:58.127 --> 00:38:59.583
Check it out.

675
00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:04.707
Your new home!

676
00:39:09.806 --> 00:39:11.717
And look, we got
a place for you right here!

677
00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:14.174
That's for me?

678
00:39:14.269 --> 00:39:18.012
Yeah, is this anything
like what you had, RJ?

679
00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:21.522
This isn't anything like what I had, Lou.

680
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.102
Here, I'm not supposed
to drink this. Thanks.

681
00:39:27.907 --> 00:39:29.898
Is that my bag?
Yeah, we brought it in here

682
00:39:29.993 --> 00:39:31.904
so you wouldn't have
to sleep up in that tree.

683
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:34.324
Really? Wow.

684
00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:37.490
Hey, RJ, check this out!
We totally hooked up the TV.

685
00:39:37.584 --> 00:39:41.623
I hot-wired the HD converter.
We get like, 1,000 channels!

686
00:39:42.171 --> 00:39:44.082
Here, can you take the remote
before my dad does?

687
00:39:44.173 --> 00:39:47.006
Wow. A universal remote?

688
00:39:49.304 --> 00:39:51.921
This is nice, guys.
Really nice.

689
00:39:53.558 --> 00:39:56.767
<i>We now
return to</i> A Scoundrel Among Us.

690
00:39:56.853 --> 00:39:58.639
<i>You should be
ashamed of yourself.</i>

691
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.347
<i>We let you into our family,
and you've deceived us.</i>

692
00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:05.105
<i>I gave you my heart, and
you ripped it into a million pieces.</i>

693
00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:08.771
<i>Get real, Kevin. 'Cause
when you feel like a dirtbag,</i>

694
00:40:08.865 --> 00:40:11.152
<i>it's because
you're a dirtbag. Right?</i>

695
00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:15.327
<i>So, just own it, just say it
out loud. "I am a dirtbag."</i>

696
00:40:15.663 --> 00:40:19.122
Dirtbag. I don't think that
guy's a real doctor.

697
00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:22.075
What do you think there, RJ? RJ?

698
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.877
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, RJ.

699
00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:31.130
What are you doing, man?
You are getting in way too deep.

700
00:40:32.221 --> 00:40:33.632
Just get the food.

701
00:40:33.723 --> 00:40:35.760
Feed the bear. Get the food.

702
00:40:36.225 --> 00:40:37.340
Feed the bear.

703
00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:39.889
Where's the food? Where's
the food? Where's the food?

704
00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:50.691
Verne. What are you doing?

705
00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:52.614
I'm getting things back
to the way they were.

706
00:40:52.742 --> 00:40:55.359
No, don't. How about I just leave? Good.

707
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:57.990
You leave, and I return this
stuff to the rightful owners.

708
00:40:58.373 --> 00:40:59.955
What? Why?

709
00:41:00.083 --> 00:41:02.290
Because we've angered the humans.

710
00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.917
And we don't wanna
end up like that rabbit.

711
00:41:05.338 --> 00:41:09.878
Hence, I'm giving this back
so they won't kill us.

712
00:41:10.009 --> 00:41:13.468
Verne, you don't understand !
We need this stuff!

713
00:41:13.638 --> 00:41:14.969
No, we don't!

714
00:41:15.348 --> 00:41:16.804
You can't take it!

715
00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:18.803
Yes, I can!

716
00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:20.725
Let go!
You let go!

717
00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:23.224
I have to have it.
No!

718
00:41:24.065 --> 00:41:25.146
Stop!

719
00:41:36.619 --> 00:41:39.953
Verne. Move slow, keep your
voice low and follow me.

720
00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:42.201
What?
Shh!

721
00:41:43.584 --> 00:41:44.574
No.

722
00:41:44.669 --> 00:41:45.704
Shh!

723
00:41:45.795 --> 00:41:49.789
No. I'm not falling for any
more of your smooth talk!

724
00:41:50.883 --> 00:41:52.715
I don't know what you're up to,

725
00:41:52.802 --> 00:41:54.668
but my entire shell is tingling.

726
00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:56.924
And you know what?
I'm listening to it this time,

727
00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:59.222
and I'm putting my foot down.
No, no.

728
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:01.925
Play?

729
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.057
Huh? Oh ! Huh?

730
00:42:05.606 --> 00:42:06.767
Play!

731
00:42:07.608 --> 00:42:08.973
Play! Play! Play!

732
00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:10.604
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play!

733
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.691
Aaah ! Oof!

734
00:42:15.116 --> 00:42:16.777
Play!

735
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.990
<i>Let's play!</i>

736
00:42:29.505 --> 00:42:30.495
Play!

737
00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:31.955
Jeez...

738
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.085
Aah!

739
00:42:33.342 --> 00:42:35.674
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play! Play!

740
00:42:35.762 --> 00:42:38.129
Down, boy. Sit.
Roll over! Play!

741
00:42:39.348 --> 00:42:41.009
Play dead !
Play!

742
00:42:43.603 --> 00:42:46.015
Attaboy, Verne. Save the food.
I'll lose the dog.

743
00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:47.266
Play.
Huh?

744
00:42:47.523 --> 00:42:50.390
Play, play, play, play.

745
00:42:54.614 --> 00:42:56.696
No! No, no, no, no.

746
00:42:58.326 --> 00:43:00.283
You're dropping
all the food, man!

747
00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:02.656
- Here, catch.
- Play!

748
00:43:03.623 --> 00:43:05.614
Are you hungry? Look, food.

749
00:43:08.544 --> 00:43:10.251
My back!
Whoa!

750
00:43:10.505 --> 00:43:12.542
Look, people! Play with them!

751
00:43:13.049 --> 00:43:14.881
Look out!
Stop! What's he doing?

752
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:17.171
What was that?
Play, play, play, play.

753
00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:20.967
I'm all right, I'm fine.
It's okay. It's...

754
00:43:25.103 --> 00:43:26.810
Verne, unhook the chain.

755
00:43:30.358 --> 00:43:31.393
Play!

756
00:43:32.068 --> 00:43:33.058
Whoa!

757
00:43:34.946 --> 00:43:35.936
No.

758
00:43:36.364 --> 00:43:37.399
Yes.

759
00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:38.984
Bad.

760
00:43:40.618 --> 00:43:42.359
Oh, boy.
Wow!

761
00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:53.454
Verne, I told you to unhook the chain.

762
00:44:10.565 --> 00:44:13.353
Garbage cans are not to be
on the curb before eight...

763
00:44:13.693 --> 00:44:14.683
Oh!

764
00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:16.692
Aah!

765
00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:30.164
You're the devil.

766
00:44:34.297 --> 00:44:37.255
Ow! Oh ! Ow!

767
00:44:47.143 --> 00:44:49.350
No! No!

768
00:44:49.562 --> 00:44:50.973
Verne, you all right there?

769
00:44:51.272 --> 00:44:53.388
Gimme a hand, Oz.
Sure, sure.

770
00:44:53.608 --> 00:44:55.349
What the heck happened?
What happened?

771
00:44:55.443 --> 00:44:58.606
It's gone.
The food ! Gone!

772
00:44:58.905 --> 00:44:59.940
What?
Gone?

773
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:02.568
How's it gone?
Ask him!

774
00:45:03.576 --> 00:45:06.568
Verne?
I returned it

775
00:45:06.662 --> 00:45:08.949
to its rightful owner.
- What?

776
00:45:09.415 --> 00:45:11.702
We, like, worked our tails off, you know?

777
00:45:11.792 --> 00:45:14.830
Like, a lot. And the food
we gathered was totally...

778
00:45:15.087 --> 00:45:17.795
You know. And you're...
You're all, whatever.

779
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:21.128
Yeah, Verne, what were you
thinking? The log was full!

780
00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:24.127
Full of junk. So, what
are you saying there?

781
00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:25.929
That the food we gather our way

782
00:45:26.015 --> 00:45:28.757
isn't as good as the food
we gather your way?

783
00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:30.967
Your way?
You mean his way.

784
00:45:31.229 --> 00:45:33.220
Can't you see RJ is just using you?

785
00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:37.015
Verne! Shame on you.
RJ wouldn't do that.

786
00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:40.185
You have got to trust me on
this. Don't you understand

787
00:45:40.279 --> 00:45:41.769
there's something wrong with this guy?

788
00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:44.572
My tail tingles every time I get near him.

789
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.909
So we're supposed to go hungry
because your butt's vibrating?

790
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.488
I'm starting to think that little tingle
of yours is just you being jealous.

791
00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:53.948
Jealous? Of him?
Yeah.

792
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.826
He's embracing the future there,

793
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.627
and you're just holding us back.

794
00:45:57.713 --> 00:46:00.205
I hold you back, all right.
From extinction.

795
00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:01.922
See what you've done here?

796
00:46:02.009 --> 00:46:04.171
If they listened to half
the stuff you're telling them,

797
00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:05.844
they'll be dead within a week.

798
00:46:05.972 --> 00:46:08.259
You are only interested
in taking advantage of them

799
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:10.761
because they're too stupid
and naive to know any better.

800
00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:16.679
I'm not stupid.

801
00:46:19.735 --> 00:46:22.193
Okay, I didn't mean...

802
00:46:23.072 --> 00:46:24.562
I meant ignorant.

803
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:28.783
To the ways over...
over there.

804
00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:32.828
Come on, you guys. You
know I didn't mean it like that.

805
00:46:33.207 --> 00:46:34.663
Don't... don't do this.

806
00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:37.454
Stella? Ozzie?

807
00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:40.749
Hammy? You know I didn't...

808
00:46:43.592 --> 00:46:46.425
Hammy...
I'm not stupid.

809
00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.175

Is it done?
Affirmative.

833
00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:38.116
Did you put this one in?
This Depelter Turbo?

834
00:48:38.374 --> 00:48:40.240
That's a contraband item, ma'am,

835
00:48:40.334 --> 00:48:43.702
as it is illegal in every
state, except Texas.

836
00:48:43.796 --> 00:48:46.208
I don't care if it's against
the Geneva Conventions.

837
00:48:46.298 --> 00:48:47.333
I want it!

838
00:48:47.425 --> 00:48:49.086
I thought you might.

839
00:48:49.718 --> 00:48:52.210
So I took the liberty
of installing it for you.

840
00:48:55.474 --> 00:48:58.557
<i>Adios,</i> animal infestation.

841
00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:01.094
Aah !

842
00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:02.262
Oh, my.

843
00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:21.368
What have I done?

844
00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:26.419
Shouldn't have taken all that food. What?

845
00:49:26.922 --> 00:49:28.833
I shouldn't have taken all that food.

846
00:49:28.924 --> 00:49:31.916
I was just trying to return things
to the way they were, that's all.

847
00:49:32.052 --> 00:49:34.840
I was just being cautious.
'Cause that's what I am.

848
00:49:35.014 --> 00:49:36.880
I'm naturally tentative.

849
00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:39.341
There's even places
in my shell I haven't been.

850
00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.222
You, on the other hand,
you're like... cool.

851
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.596
And crazy and fearless.

852
00:49:45.065 --> 00:49:47.352
I think they're right.
I think I'm just jealous.

853
00:49:48.861 --> 00:49:50.693
Verne, believe me,

854
00:49:51.071 --> 00:49:53.312
you should not be jealous of me.

855
00:49:54.074 --> 00:49:55.280
You got a good thing here.

856
00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.525
You're trying to do
what's best for your family.

857
00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.827
And I think you're
what's best for them now.

858
00:50:00.748 --> 00:50:01.909
What about your tail?

859
00:50:03.751 --> 00:50:05.116
My head says listen to my tail,

860
00:50:05.211 --> 00:50:07.794
my tail says listen
to my head, and I just...

861
00:50:08.422 --> 00:50:10.629
end up with an upset stomach.

862
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.957
That's why you need to be in charge now.

863
00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:16.090
You don't know what's
going on here. And you do.

864
00:50:16.347 --> 00:50:19.556
So, what's the problem?
This, Verne, is the problem.

865
00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:21.804
You see this?
I'm listening.

866
00:50:21.936 --> 00:50:22.926
Just...

867
00:50:23.062 --> 00:50:24.223
Uh-huh?

868
00:50:24.313 --> 00:50:25.803
Just hang on a second.
All right?

869
00:50:27.233 --> 00:50:28.644
I...

870
00:50:28.776 --> 00:50:31.768
You the lady throwing the
party? Yes. Just to the right.

871
00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:34.820
There are protective booties
for you to put on over your shoes.

872
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:36.856
Yes! Yes!

873
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.577
What is this?
What?

874
00:50:42.414 --> 00:50:44.325
Oh. That...
Mmm-hmm?

875
00:50:45.084 --> 00:50:46.415
...is a

876
00:50:46.669 --> 00:50:49.286
list of all the stuff
that you lost, Verne.

877
00:50:49.421 --> 00:50:51.879
Really? It's a big, long
list. You can see that.

878
00:50:51.966 --> 00:50:55.209
You're an organized little
guy, aren't you? Nice job.

879
00:50:55.427 --> 00:50:58.089
But, you know what? I know
a place so chock-full of food,

880
00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.841
we could get it all back in one night.

881
00:50:59.932 --> 00:51:01.798
Great. Let's go.
Where is it?

882
00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:03.720
Inside that house.
What?

883
00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:05.184
Aah!

884
00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:10.519
What is the point of this
thing? Just send it down.

885
00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:12.817
What Verne is trying to say is...

886
00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.608
I mean, it's hard to really
sum it all up in just one word.

887
00:51:17.825 --> 00:51:19.611
But...
I'm sorry.

888
00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:22.451
Come here.

889
00:51:22.538 --> 00:51:24.370
- Come here, Verne.
- That's right.

890
00:51:24.582 --> 00:51:25.617
Watch the quills.

891
00:51:25.708 --> 00:51:28.120
Okay! Listen, stay in the
huddle. Here's the plan.

892
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:33.296
Now, the traps are set
here, here, here,

893
00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.509
here, here, here,
here, here, here,

894
00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:41.008
here, here, here and here.

895
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:47.389
Here, here, here, here.

896
00:51:48.314 --> 00:51:50.681
Big one here, here,

897
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:54.017
- and maybe a few over here.
- Gee, is that all?

898
00:51:54.111 --> 00:51:56.899
No. There's a bunch
of red lights all over here.

899
00:51:57.615 --> 00:51:59.356
Okay, Verne?
Looking a little green.

900
00:51:59.491 --> 00:52:02.108
I blacked out for a second
there, but I get the idea.

901
00:52:02.202 --> 00:52:04.819
There's lights, traps... I
might need to change my shell.

902
00:52:05.164 --> 00:52:07.531
Okay, this is us.

903
00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:09.991
Can I be the car?
I wanna be the car!

904
00:52:10.085 --> 00:52:13.373
I'm the car. You be the shoe.
The shoe is lame.

905
00:52:13.464 --> 00:52:15.580
Why don't you be that
snazzy-looking iron there?

906
00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:17.506
Hey, it's not important!

907
00:52:17.593 --> 00:52:20.506
Besides, I'm the car.
I'm always the car.

908
00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:22.587
The plan works in three simple steps.

909
00:52:22.681 --> 00:52:24.137
Step one, kill the lights.

910
00:52:24.391 --> 00:52:27.804
Step two, get inside. Step three,
get out with mountain of food.

911
00:52:27.895 --> 00:52:29.852
But this place is like a fortress.

912
00:52:29.938 --> 00:52:32.475
Walls, so high.
Doors, impenetrable.

913
00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:35.771
How will we get in?
The collar is the key.

914
00:52:37.363 --> 00:52:39.024
Literally, the collar.

915
00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:41.401
It's like a key that opens the door and if...

916
00:52:41.492 --> 00:52:42.482
And what?

917
00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:44.988
You think he's just gonna
hand over his collar to you?

918
00:52:45.079 --> 00:52:47.286
Not to me, my femme fatale. To you.

919
00:52:47.373 --> 00:52:48.534
Her?
Me?

920
00:52:48.707 --> 00:52:50.243
You, Stella, will get that cat

921
00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:52.666
to give you his collar by using...

922
00:52:52.878 --> 00:52:55.370
My stink.
Your feminine charms.

923
00:52:56.632 --> 00:52:57.838
Was that out loud?

924
00:52:58.467 --> 00:53:03.007
Look, raccoon, maybe that mask
you're wearing is obstructing your view,

925
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.093
but if you haven't noticed,
I'm a skunk.

926
00:53:06.183 --> 00:53:07.594
On the outside, maybe.

927
00:53:07.726 --> 00:53:10.309
But I'm looking inside,
Stella, and I see a fox.

928
00:53:10.396 --> 00:53:12.888
And all we gotta do is get her out.

929
00:53:18.237 --> 00:53:19.693
Scissors.
Scissors? Whoa, hey!

930
00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.362
Here we go.
Hey, hey, watch the...

931
00:53:21.532 --> 00:53:23.273
- Charcoal.
- Charcoal?

932
00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.324
Air freshener.
Tomato juice.

933
00:53:26.412 --> 00:53:28.528
- Cork.
- Cork? Don't you dare.

934
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.991
Get 'em !
Score! Yeah!

935
00:53:38.132 --> 00:53:40.089
- One more thing.
- Ow!

936
00:53:40.467 --> 00:53:42.208
Whoa. Stop. That's it.

937
00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:45.174
Ladies and gentlemen,
our work here is done.

938
00:53:47.307 --> 00:53:48.889
Oh, my.

939
00:53:49.017 --> 00:53:52.305
Big jeepers.
She's all like, wow.

940
00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:53.761
What?

941
00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.181
Oh.

942
00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:05.068
Meow.

943
00:54:05.159 --> 00:54:06.820
Whoa!
Amazing!

944
00:54:07.035 --> 00:54:08.946
Gosh, she looks...

945
00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:10.577
Wow.

946
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:19.583
All right, gang, this is it.
We're going in.

947
00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:32.008
Not again. Dang it!
Those things are so lifelike.

948
00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:35.019
Curse you, plastic moldsman.

949
00:54:53.665 --> 00:54:54.905
Okay, Hammy.

950
00:54:55.501 --> 00:54:56.491
Whoa!

951
00:54:56.919 --> 00:54:58.125
Hammy!

952
00:55:12.017 --> 00:55:16.011
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

953
00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:19.055
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

954
00:55:20.484 --> 00:55:22.566
Hammy, I told you that cookie's junk!

955
00:55:22.694 --> 00:55:24.401
But I like a cookie.

956
00:55:24.947 --> 00:55:27.484
What's going on?
Is everything okay?

957
00:55:28.826 --> 00:55:29.816
Mmm-hmm.

958
00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:36.113
Here we go!

959
00:55:36.208 --> 00:55:37.414
Come on, Hammy, come on.

960
00:55:37.501 --> 00:55:39.913
Follow the pretty light.
There it is, that's it.

961
00:55:42.297 --> 00:55:43.833
That's it, that's it.

962
00:55:44.132 --> 00:55:45.793
There it is. Go get it.

963
00:55:52.516 --> 00:55:53.847
That's it, that's it.

964
00:55:56.186 --> 00:55:57.676
Go get it, you little nut!

965
00:55:59.147 --> 00:56:01.935
Bingo! Okay, step two.

966
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:04.687
I thought we'd be dead by step
two, so this is going great!

967
00:56:07.614 --> 00:56:09.230
Okay, gorgeous, you're on.

968
00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:15.452
Man, this better be one stupid cat.

969
00:56:15.747 --> 00:56:17.033
Audio, go!

970
00:56:21.086 --> 00:56:22.201
She's supposed to be a cat.

971
00:56:22.296 --> 00:56:25.505
Put it on cat. Maybe the cat likes a
cow. Let's hope the cat likes a cow.

972
00:56:25.632 --> 00:56:26.838
Who goes there?

973
00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.837
You're a cat!
You're a cat!

974
00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:31.051
You're a cat!

975
00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:33.633
I mean, I'm a cat.

976
00:56:33.724 --> 00:56:36.842
Uh, meow.
Yeah, right.

977
00:56:37.185 --> 00:56:39.096
Shoo. Go on, get away from here.

978
00:56:39.271 --> 00:56:42.059
My owner does not give
scraps to common strays.

979
00:56:42.274 --> 00:56:44.982
Common strays?
All right, you asked for it.

980
00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.102
Get the collar! Gee, that's
a nice collar you got on.

981
00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:50.988
Mind if I have a look?
No, no, no! Come no closer!

982
00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:54.066
I must not be so near a
creature of the outdoor woods.

983
00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:58.946
Away with your filth !
My filth?

984
00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:01.824
My filth?
Jeepers, here we go.

985
00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:05.874
Okay, that's it. I am sick and tired
of everybody taking one look at me

986
00:57:05.964 --> 00:57:08.205
and running away
'cause they think I'm filthy.

987
00:57:08.383 --> 00:57:10.124
Well, I got news for you.

988
00:57:10.218 --> 00:57:14.007
I didn't get all primped and preened to
have some over-fed, pompous puffball

989
00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:18.011
tell me he's too good for me.
I got makeup on my butt, dude!

990
00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:19.933
And you don't even
wanna know about the cork!

991
00:57:20.228 --> 00:57:24.187
Stop! No one has ever
spoken to me like that!

992
00:57:26.818 --> 00:57:29.150
It is bold. I like it.

993
00:57:33.033 --> 00:57:35.741
Well, believe me, there's more
where that came from...

994
00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:39.073
Puffball.
All right, team, let's boogie.

995
00:57:39.414 --> 00:57:42.497
You are strong.
Your essence is overpowering.

996
00:57:42.834 --> 00:57:45.576
What? What do you mean
by that? It is your eyes.

997
00:57:45.921 --> 00:57:49.004
My eyes.
They are luminous.

998
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:52.299
Luminous? Dang.

999
00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:55.340
You know, I think this is
the part where I blacked out.

1000
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.797
Did the little shoes and cars
actually get into the house?

1001
00:58:00.185 --> 00:58:02.677
So, you got a name?
Yes.

1002
00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:05.725
It is a Persian name, for I am Persian.

1003
00:58:05.899 --> 00:58:09.142
I was born Prince Tigeriess Mahmood Shabaz.

1004
00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:13.278
Ooh, that's a mouthful.
Can I just call you Tiger?

1005
00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:14.939
Whoa.

1006
00:58:15.033 --> 00:58:18.367
- This place is huge.
- Wicked cool.

1007
00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:21.783
Animals are in the house.

1008
00:58:31.591 --> 00:58:33.081
Wow!

1009
00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:37.545
- My goodness.
- This is so cool.

1010
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:41.094
Yes! Okay, stations,
everybody. Let's boogie!

1011
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:42.470
We got it.
Here we go.

1012
00:58:42.561 --> 00:58:43.926
No grip, no grip, no grip.

1013
00:58:45.647 --> 00:58:48.730
Hammy! Less claw, more pad.
Oh, okay.

1014
00:58:50.277 --> 00:58:51.358
That hurt.

1015
00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:58.407
Uh-oh.

1016
00:58:59.786 --> 00:59:02.574
Just a minute, I'll be
right there. What was that?

1017
00:59:02.873 --> 00:59:05.581
It... That's just the sound of
my heart. Can't you hear it?

1018
00:59:08.754 --> 00:59:10.415
Aaah!

1019
00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:13.372
This way, this way!

1020
00:59:19.723 --> 00:59:22.135
Okay, okay, we're good.
Go back to work.

1021
00:59:23.602 --> 00:59:24.592
There ya go.

1022
00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:26.514
Here, catch!

1023
00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:34.060
Oh, boy.

1024
00:59:35.989 --> 00:59:37.855
Yes, I'm gonna make it.

1025
00:59:37.949 --> 00:59:40.941
My father, he had an exceptionally flat face.

1026
00:59:41.703 --> 00:59:44.536
He was so beautiful,
he could barely breathe.

1027
00:59:44.623 --> 00:59:46.034
Fascinating.

1028
00:59:46.124 --> 00:59:49.708
Inside, I have a multi-leveled
climby-thing with shag carpet.

1029
00:59:50.045 --> 00:59:52.082
Come, I show you.
No, no!

1030
00:59:52.172 --> 00:59:53.662
I haven't told you about my life.

1031
00:59:53.757 --> 00:59:55.543
Good, good. Going great, going great.

1032
00:59:58.011 --> 00:59:59.046
What is that?

1033
00:59:59.137 --> 01:00:01.674
That is what gets the humans
out of bed in the morning.

1034
01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:05.932
Where'd she go?

1035
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.635
Get down and stay down.

1036
01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:16.442
Move. Move.

1037
01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:38.048
Come on ! We've gotta go
before she comes back.

1038
01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:42.090
No! Not without those Spuddies. What?

1039
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.966
Lou, Penny, back to the TV.

1040
01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:45.718
Heather, keep an eye on that human.

1041
01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:47.845
I'm on it, RJ.
No, Heather. Wait!

1042
01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.348
The tingle, the tingle.

1043
01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:52.805
RJ ! The wagon's full,
let's get out of here.

1044
01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.810
Hang on, Vincent, this'll only take a second.

1045
01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:56.141
Vincent?
Where?

1046
01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:58.694
Who's Vincent?
Verne, Vincent.

1047
01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.442
Simple slip of the bear.
Tongue! I...

1048
01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:04.404
Just bear with me is what I meant to say.

1049
01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:07.619
There's no bear.

1050
01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:11.665
Mmm?
Oh!

1051
01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:14.288
Lights fading.
Limbs growing co...

1052
01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:18.004
Heather.

1053
01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:28.886
Heather!

1054
01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:32.307
There's a dead, white rat on my staircase.

1055
01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.058
I thought you were dead.

1056
01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.810
I learned from the best, Dad.

1057
01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:42.233
That's my girl.

1058
01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:44.690
Come to Papa.

1059
01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:46.904
We better hurry.
We don't have much time.

1060
01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:49.077
What's going on, RJ?
Nothing!

1061
01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:51.280
Well then, let's get out of here
because we have what we need.

1062
01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:53.578
No, we don't.
What are you talking about?

1063
01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:55.955
We have more than enough.
Hey, listen.

1064
01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:57.332
I've got this long to hand over

1065
01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:59.288
that wagon of food to a homicidal bear,

1066
01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:03.467
and if these Spuddies aren't on the
menu, then I will be. Now let go of my tail.

1067
01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:04.798
What?

1068
01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:06.841
Let go!

1069
01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:09.423
Aah!

1070
01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:11.425
Hey, whoa!

1071
01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.098
Huh?

1072
01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:16.347
I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

1073
01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:18.808
Stella, Stella, where are you going?

1074
01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.564
Stella!

1075
01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:24.896
Aaah!

1076
01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:27.032
Stella!

1077
01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.028
Look, it's not you. It won't
work, okay, because I'm a...

1078
01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:33.409
Skunk!

1079
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.454
Yeah, that. Sorry you have to see this.

1080
01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:37.792
Fire in the hole!

1081
01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.714
Oh my... This smell doesn't bother you?

1082
01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:49.888
No. This face was bred for beauty.

1083
01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:51.844
I cannot smell a thing.

1084
01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:53.892
You can't smell?

1085
01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:03.901
To the door!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1086
01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:06.438
- Run !
- This way!

1087
01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:12.236
Let's party.

1088
01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:14.204
Bunnies!

1089
01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:15.413
Aah !

1090
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:16.865
Flee, my love.

1091
01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:20.915
Run, that way. Outside!

1092
01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:21.996
Move, kids! Come on!

1093
01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:30.095
<i>Buenos dias,</i> reptile.

1094
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.010
You've just been verminated.

1095
01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:41.064
Whoa! You stink.

1096
01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:44.644
That's because you
let them into my house!

1097
01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:47.442
Those... Hey, Nancy,
stop your honkin'.

1098
01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:50.775
These little guys will be
disposed of quickly and humanely.

1099
01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:54.737
No! Not humanely.
As inhumanely as possible.

1100
01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.626
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, ma'am.

1101
01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:21.726
What's he gonna do to us,
Mama? I don't know, baby.

1102
01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:25.525
I don't wanna die, Dad.
Not for real.

1103
01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:28.946
There, there, there,
sweetheart. We'll be okay.

1104
01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:35.410
You were right about him, Verne.

1105
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:38.326
We shoulda listened.
Sorry there.

1106
01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:40.373
No.

1107
01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:46.129
I knew we couldn't trust him,
and I got us into this.

1108
01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.208
I should've known better.

1109
01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:58.513
Wow!

1110
01:04:58.686 --> 01:04:59.676
Vincent?

1111
01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:02.771
So, I was on my way
down here to kill you.

1112
01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:06.233
But I stopped to watch
the show, and I gotta say...

1113
01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:10.278
That, right there,

1114
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.071
is a thing of beauty.

1115
01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:18.154
That is the most vicious, deceitful,

1116
01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:21.414
self-serving thing I've ever seen.

1117
01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.285
Classic RJ.

1118
01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:28.505
You take the food,
and they take the fall.

1119
01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:36.968
You keep this up, you're
gonna end up just like me.

1120
01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:39.887
Having everything you ever wanted.

1121
01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:42.561
But I already had that.

1122
01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:46.811
What, them?
Who are you kidding?

1123
01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:50.565
You said it yourself,
you're a family of one.

1124
01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:52.779
Always will be.

1125
01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:55.653
It's how guys like you and me survive.

1126
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:58.902
So, a few saps got hurt in the process.

1127
01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:03.286
Tough. That's life.
Trust me, you don't need them.

1128
01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:07.873
Actually, I do.

1129
01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:13.174
And right now,
they really need me.

1130
01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.257
So, I really need this!

1131
01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.338
RJ!

1132
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:26.396
What the...

1133
01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:36.023
- There goes my back again.
- Are you okay?

1134
01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:42.951
You sorry sack of rat dung.

1135
01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:46.534
Whoa, Stella, this is a
rescue. I'm rescuing you.

1136
01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:49.745
I'm gonna gas you so hard
your grandchildren'll stink.

1137
01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:51.204
Bear!
What's that?

1138
01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:52.456
Bear!
Hair?

1139
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.790
Bear!
Dare?

1140
01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:55.967
Bear!
Bear!

1141
01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:03.050
What?

1142
01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.056
Whoa!

1143
01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:08.889
We're out of control !
We can drive.

1144
01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:11.775
It's just like
<i>Auto-Homicide 3!</i> What?

1145
01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:19.734
Verne, let me in !
Wrong button ! Wrong button!

1146
01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:22.868
<i>Please select destination.</i>

1147
01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.872
Take us home!
Take us to the log!

1148
01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:29.250
<i>Previous destination selected.
Make a legal U-turn.</i>

1149
01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:30.452
We got it!

1150
01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:37.175
Hammy! Let me in !
Not listening to RJ.

1151
01:07:39.138 --> 01:07:40.845
Kids, lose that bear!

1152
01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.172
What weapons do we have?

1153
01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:44.599
We've got a hammer.
Cool.

1154
01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:47.803
You little...

1155
01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:52.148
Thank you. Yes, yes! Hey!

1156
01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:55.978
Let me in, let me in !
No! Ring-tailed charlatan!

1157
01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.107
Ozzie!

1158
01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:58.984
He's just trying to help us.
Just let him in.

1159
01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.612
After what he did to us?
But he came back.

1160
01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:04.035
And he brought a bear.

1161
01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:09.074
Hey! No fighting while we're driving.

1162
01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:11.705
We will turn this van around, mister.

1163
01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:14.375
He started it.

1164
01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:16.422
I'm telling you, he's
trying to help us, really.

1165
01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:20.006
But, Verne, you're the one
who always says trust your tail.

1166
01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:21.549
But it's not tingling.

1167
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:22.887
Oh!

1168
01:08:23.016 --> 01:08:25.178
Why didn't you say so?
Hey!

1169
01:08:27.061 --> 01:08:28.267
Thank you, thank you.

1170
01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:32.434
- You're dead, RJ !
- Duck!

1171
01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.271
- And your friends are next.
- Look out!

1172
01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:38.527
<i>Make an immediate left turn.</i>

1173
01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:40.568
Whoa!

1174
01:08:42.994 --> 01:08:44.325
Bonus points!

1175
01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:46.661
Huh?

1176
01:08:54.047 --> 01:08:55.208
Yeah!

1177
01:08:55.632 --> 01:08:57.543
Ohh!

1178
01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:00.587
RJ!

1179
01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:02.419
Yeah !
Aah!

1180
01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:04.595
Look out.
High score.

1181
01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:06.844
No, no, no, no!

1182
01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.662
<i>You have arrived.</i>

1183
01:09:32.543 --> 01:09:34.534
Everybody all right?

1184
01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:38.880
Come on ! We've gotta go, we've gotta go!

1185
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.041
The old jazz dance injury.

1186
01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.757
Come on, come on. Quillo!
Go, go, go.

1187
01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:52.010
Did we make it?
That was close!

1188
01:09:52.105 --> 01:09:53.391
All right!
Are we here?

1189
01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:55.973
Penny? The kids here?
Hammy?

1190
01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:57.307
Scary clown.

1191
01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:58.433
Aah!

1192
01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:06.908
Look out!

1193
01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:16.168
A weed hacker, Verne.
A weed hacker!

1194
01:10:17.004 --> 01:10:19.371
- Hey!
- Up, up, go up.

1195
01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:23.045
Show your little rat faces.
Filthy creatures.

1196
01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:26.128
Stay in the woods where you belong!

1197
01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:27.967
Watch out!

1198
01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:36.722
You guys wanna party, do ya?
All right, then, let's party.

1199
01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.226
- Mom !
- Kids!

1200
01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:44.525
Penny, Lou, look out! Down!

1201
01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:47.615
That's it!

1202
01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:50.443
Verne, get everybody
out of here. I'll distract him.

1203
01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:53.405
Are you crazy? He'll kill you.
Well, I'm the one he wants.

1204
01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.039
Take care of your family, Verne.

1205
01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:57.208
I intend to.
The whole family.

1206
01:10:57.336 --> 01:11:00.249
There's got to be something
we can do. There's no time.

1207
01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:04.295
Hammy!
Hammy!

1208
01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:10.221
Ahh.

1209
01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:12.887
Hey, Vincent. You were right.

1210
01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:16.220
With a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.

1211
01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:17.887
RJ!

1212
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.687
Now, Hammy. Go, go, go!

1213
01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:23.184
Okay...

1214
01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.442
I got the cookie.

1215
01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:38.138
Huh?
Ohh.

1216
01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:48.232
That's the...
The Depelter Turbo.

1217
01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:51.235
Prepare for a lot of stinging.

1218
01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:55.068
Oh, no!
No, no! No, no! No!

1219
01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:09.215
Ow! Ow! Ouch!

1220
01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:10.463
My hair!

1221
01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:12.794
That stung like I knew it would!

1222
01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:26.853
Yeah !
All right!

1223
01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:29.561
Good job, everybody.
That's teamwork.

1224
01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:32.147
Come here, Hammy, come here.
You are a genius, my boy.

1225
01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.482
Thank you.

1226
01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:38.783
And, Verne, don't you ever
fix this shell!

1227
01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:40.997
Yeah. Glad it's working for ya.

1228
01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:43.200
Take it off, give it back.

1229
01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.919
Here we go, off to the
Rockies for you, Smoky.

1230
01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.668
Now, you do realize
that was a Depelter Turbo?

1231
01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.716
Officer, please. It
was that Verminator.

1232
01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:54.419
He sold it to me. This has
nothing to do with me.

1233
01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:56.003
Hey, hey,
it was in your yard.

1234
01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:58.715
Your name's on the contract,
so can tell it to the judge.

1235
01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:01.218
No! It's not my fault!
Let go of me! Ma'am...

1236
01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:05.021
I can't be arrested ! I'm the president
of the homeowner's association!

1237
01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:06.890
Take her down!

1238
01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:08.270
She's getting away!

1239
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.152
We got a twitcher!
Watch it! Ma'am ! Get her!

1240
01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:15.569
Stop that!
Can I get help over here?

1241
01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:17.696
Somebody get a hold of her
legs!

1242
01:14:17.912 --> 01:14:19.243
- Play?
- Oh, no!

1243
01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:21.196
No, no! No, no!

1244
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:22.576
Aah!

1245
01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:24.365
High five, Hammy!

1246
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.621
Yes!
It worked ! It worked!

1247
01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:28.378
We did it!
All right!

1248
01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:31.422
- Yes!
- Stella!

1249
01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:33.216
Stella!
Over here, Tiger.

1250
01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:35.005
Stella.

1251
01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:41.259
So, this is the outdoor
woods? I like it.

1252
01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:43.389
Come on, big boy.
You're coming with me.

1253
01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:47.347
You know, RJ,
just for the record,

1254
01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:50.191
if you had told us that all
that food you were trying to get

1255
01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:53.360
was to pay back an angry bear,
we would've given it to you.

1256
01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:56.857
Really? Yeah, that's what families do.

1257
01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:58.783
They look out for each other.

1258
01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:01.198
I've never really had anything like that.

1259
01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:04.497
I know.
But believe me, this...

1260
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:07.621
This is the gateway to the good life.

1261
01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:10.036
Really wish you would've told me that sooner.

1262
01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:13.624
Yeah, well, that's bad communication.
Also something families do.

1263
01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:16.418
So, what do you say?
You wanna be a part of it?

1264
01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:26.307
Come here, come here.
I promised I wouldn't do this. Okay.

1265
01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.480
Welcome to the family!

1266
01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:31.149
- Hey!
- Group hug!

1267
01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:32.976
Okay, okay.

1268
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.027
What a first week of spring.

1269
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:39.108
Wait a minute! That means
there's only 267 days left till winter.

1270
01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.783
What are we gonna do for food?

1271
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.827
Oh ! Oh, oh, oh, oh !
Oh, oh, oh!

1272
01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:45.121
Yes, Hammy.

1273
01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:46.368
I filled the log.

1274
01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:49.284
Jeepers!
What...

1275
01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.169
Look, look! I found my nuts!

1276
01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:16.477
<i>That, my friends, is the object
of all human attention and devotion.</i>

1277
01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:19.392
<i>- And they call it a TV.</i>
<i>- Wicked cool!</i>

1278
01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:22.611
<i>Humans feel an inner need to
connect with the world around them.</i>

1279
01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.188
<i>That is super-duper.</i>

1280
01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:26.240
<i>They also feel a need
to sit on their fat butts.</i>

1281
01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:28.443
<i>Watching TV fulfills
both needs at the same time.</i>

1282
01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:30.323
<i>Wow. Interesting.</i>

1283
01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:33.031
<i>Come on, kids. Family
time there, in front of the TV.</i>

1284
01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.286
<i>Got your snack food?</i>

1285
01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.866
<i>Buy a vowel. Buy a vowel!</i>

1286
01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:37.668
<i>Buy a "Y". Please buy a "Y".</i>

1287
01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:40.292
<i>- I can't find the remote.</i>
<i>- Hey, Spikey, race ya!</i>

1288
01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.965
<i>- Has anybody seen the remote?
- Dad, chill.</i>

1289
01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:44.463
<i>I could do a little TV.</i>

1290
01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:47.170
<i>I think, today's the day we
find out if the baby is gifted,</i>

1291
01:18:47.264 --> 01:18:48.754
<i>or if Saxon is really an alien.</i>

1292
01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:50.635
<i>Like Khan in</i> Star Trek ll!

1293
01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.342
<i>The Genesis Project was in
the hands of the</i> Enterprise,

1294
01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:55.095
<i>but Khan had his plan to steal
the invention of renewable life!</i>

1295
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:56.645
<i>Well, that was specific.</i>

1296
01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:58.689
<i>I saw it on TNT,
a retrospective.</i>

1297
01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:01.143
<i>- Gummi Worm, anybody?
- Let me have one.</i>

1298
01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.069
<i>Bucky, pass this to Lou.</i>

1299
01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:05.362
<i>- Taste this.</i>
<i>- Don't you take that.</i>

1300
01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:07.690
<i>This is the perfect
food.</i> RJ: <i>Fat-free cookies?</i>

1301
01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:09.696
<i>You might as well just be
eating dirt.</i>

1302
01:19:09.787 --> 01:19:12.324
<i>I've had dirt. I
don't like dirt. It tastes like dirt.</i>

1303
01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:15.281
<i>Shh!
The show is starting.</i>

1304
01:23:07.524 --> 01:23:09.014
Hang on a minute.

1305
01:23:09.359 --> 01:23:12.272
I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait.

1306
01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:18.942
Yes! Here we go.

1307
01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:24.281
Kind of anticlimactic.
Shoot!
