1
00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:57.349
- Yeah, I'm telling you:

2
00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:02.104
-all this talk about werewolves
is pure fabrication.

3
00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:04.731
-What about that nephew
of yours,

4
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.360
who was found sneaking around the garden
in slippers at the age of nine?

5
00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:12.406
- All children today
are weird.

6
00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:19.705
- I'm thinking of getting a piercing.
- You don't say.

7
00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:53.614
- You know, Becky, if the weevil attacked you
on you, I'd help you.

8
00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:59.870
- How romantic!

9
00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:10.297
- A fffantom!

10
00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:19.723
- Call me! My name is Stench.
I'm in the book.
(Book of the Dead)

11
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:31.235
- Good evening!
That video had a visionary feel to it.
And we want to make sure you get the full benefit.

12
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:40.619
- No need to thank me.
My name is Stinky.
And I'm happy to help.

13
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.875
-Thanks for the popcorn!

14
00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.217
- Hey!

15
00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:04.601
- Uh, what can I tell you?
I made the popcorn frosting myself.
and it's not exactly butter.

16
00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:23.036
-Hey, you haven't seen my uncles, have you? -No.
-I don't get paid enough to see anything, kid.

17
00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:27.624
-If you want to come in and watch, you have to buy a ticket.

18
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.795
-I don't have any money on me. Can I owe you?

19
00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:44.308
- I'm pretty sure they're inside.
- I'm telling you for the last time...

20
00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:51.607
- OK, normally by now you would
say something stereotypical like:
- A ghost! And run away screaming.

21
00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.318
- But come on, this stuff has been done.

22
00:03:54.318 --> 00:04:04.119
- O fff fantomaa! Aaaa!
- Hmm, that never happened to her
to Patrick Swayze.

23
00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:28.101
CASPER'S HAUNTED CHRISTMAS

24
00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:42.843
- Hi guys!
- What are you doing here?

25
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:51.185
- You know, as usual, I try to
to stop you from terrorizing the city.

26
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.398
- That's the problem! You should help us.
- Yeah, you should join the team, Casper.

27
00:05:57.024 --> 00:06:02.654
- With us, you'd be one for all and
all for one.

28
00:06:04.323 --> 00:06:08.911
- I'm not breaking up this trio!

29
00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:12.748
- This is the ghost police.

30
00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:16.293
- Jesus! Police!

31
00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:38.273
- Exactly! It's me and my mighty
ghost car.

32
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:45.572
Officer Snivel, the watchman
the ectoplasmic laws.

33
00:06:46.198 --> 00:06:49.743
Feel free to treat me with respect
and/or fear?

34
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.957
- It's just Snivel.

35
00:06:57.668 --> 00:07:00.796
- Officer Snivel, if you don't mind.

36
00:07:00.796 --> 00:07:16.854
- Now, you have violated paragraphs 3 and 4,
paragraph b of the code...
- Did you guys hear him? I broke the law! I'm shaking!

37
00:07:21.692 --> 00:07:28.991
- And what are you going to do, officer?
- Arrest us?

38
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:35.664
- Hey, that's my car!
I've only got two payments left.

39
00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:49.261
- There you go!
- Thanks, but...
- Casper's right, guys.

40
00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:55.517
-We shouldn't be driving around in the guy's car.
It's not fair.

41
00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:59.688
- Ha, I got your whistle.
-Give it back.

42
00:08:03.442 --> 00:08:04.902
- Nooo.

43
00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:26.798
- Hey, did you hear that?
- I don't hear anything.
- That's what I mean.

44
00:08:27.508 --> 00:08:31.053
- Okay, that's not good.

45
00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:48.779
- What does the whistle do?
- It's for emergencies only.
It invokes Kabbash.

46
00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:56.703
- Kabbash, the spirit king of all ghosts,
the evil, cruel and vicious one?

47
00:08:56.703 --> 00:09:01.291
- No, Kabbash, the country-western singer.

48
00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:14.972
- Who dares invoke Kabbash?

49
00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:25.399
- Snivel, it's my weekend off. Can you give me
a reason not to skin you alive?

50
00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:30.612
- I have no skin, I'm not alive.

51
00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:37.911
- Stop! Mr. Kabbash!
It's not his fault.

52
00:09:38.537 --> 00:09:45.919
- Snivel was just doing his job. I mean.
that my uncles are bad boys, really bad boys...

53
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.422
- Quiet, worm!

54
00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:52.593
- Yes, your omnipotence.

55
00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:57.806
- I was actually sent to get you, Casper.
- Me? I didn't do anything.

56
00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:01.977
- That's the problem.
Your scare plan is very small.

57
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:07.858
- But I scare people all the time.
- But you do it without meaning to.

58
00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:12.446
- So it doesn't count. You didn't scare either
even Haloween.

59
00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:20.787
- You stayed home and rented
"Free Willy 3"

60
00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:29.129
- I told you I didn't leave that napkin.

61
00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:37.137
- According to ghost law, you must
intentionally scare at least one person a year.

62
00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:39.640
- And if not?

63
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:47.981
- Good question. If Casper doesn't freak out
anyone, let's see what he wins.

64
00:10:49.775 --> 00:10:59.451
- Where are they?
- This is darkness.

65
00:11:00.077 --> 00:11:03.622
- The place where time and space
are nothing.

66
00:11:04.248 --> 00:11:08.836
- An empty, desolate prison where
you will remain for eternity.

67
00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:16.134
- Ha, ha, ha, enjoy your stay!
- It's ghost time!

68
00:11:17.803 --> 00:11:25.519
- Who turned off the light?
- What's wrong, kids?
- Why did he bring us here?

69
00:11:29.818 --> 00:11:32.818
- Why not?
- Hey, that's not fair!
- Quiet!

70
00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:39.783
- Yes, fun for the whole family.
This is where you'll stay for eternity.

71
00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:47.499
- Casper won't make any more friends,
and the three of you will be able to freak out
only each other.

72
00:11:48.125 --> 00:12:00.721
- It will be, if Casper doesn't fulfill his duties
as a ghost and doesn't scare anyone.

73
00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:06.351
- OK, OK, but the kid will scare someone,
no problem!
-Promise!

74
00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:11.565
- We will make sure it does.
- I know we will.

75
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:21.992
- Until Casper scares someone, you three
have your hunting licenses suspended.

76
00:12:22.618 --> 00:12:30.334
- You have until Christmas Day!

77
00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:38.675
- Why are we losing our permits because
this little guy with the big head got it wrong?

78
00:12:39.301 --> 00:12:44.932
- Because as an uncle,
you are responsible for him.

79
00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:50.145
- And besides, I don't like you.
- Have a nice trip!

80
00:12:50.771 --> 00:13:00.572
- Travel?
- Until Casper scares someone, you're all sent
to Chriss, Massachusetts.

81
00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:07.871
- The most "Christmasy" city in the world.
- But we hate Christmas!

82
00:13:08.497 --> 00:13:13.085
- Ha, ha, ha, I know.

83
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:31.854
- You're fired!

84
00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:15.647
- Noel, honey, can I have the beer?
- In a minute, honey.

85
00:14:17.316 --> 00:14:25.032
- How about something a little more "Christmasy"?

86
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:34.625
- Here's your jam.
(Christmas Eve)

87
00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:38.837
- It will make you hear the bells.

88
00:14:39.463 --> 00:14:40.506
- Do we really need a Christmas tree
in every room in the house?

89
00:14:40.506 --> 00:14:50.307
- Well, you know what they say:
You can never have too much Christmas.

90
00:14:50.516 --> 00:14:51.308
- Says who?
- We do.

91
00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:53.393
-I need some privacy.

92
00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:01.318
- Ready! I'm off.

93
00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:13.497
- If I hear one more person say...
- Merry Christmas!

94
00:15:13.497 --> 00:15:21.421
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas Holly!

95
00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:29.096
- Merry Christmas home!
- Merry Christmas, pillar!

96
00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.517
- Merry Christmas to all!

97
00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:39.022
- Well, you have to look on the bright side:
it can't be winter forever.

98
00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:43.819
- Summer's coming, right?
- Isn't it?

99
00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:53.996
- Okay. I'm talking to a snowman.
-I'm officially "screwed."

100
00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:59.126
- Lack of friends and Christmas overdose
have combined to drive me crazy.

101
00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:07.301
- Shooting stars?

102
00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:11.513
- Bright star, bright star,
the first star I saw tonight...

103
00:16:12.014 --> 00:16:15.225
- I wish I could, I wish I could...

104
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.103
- I'll be out of the way in time!

105
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:32.117
- Ha, ha, ha. Casper just did a face-plant
in the snow, sensational!

106
00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:35.621
-Wind resistance due to
because it has a big head!

107
00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:39.750
- Ha ha ha, a real brake!

108
00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:10.239
- It's... it's...
- Oh no, not again.

109
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.074
- A Talking Snowman?!

110
00:17:12.908 --> 00:17:14.284
- That's new!

111
00:17:14.952 --> 00:17:17.538
- Would you be afraid if it was a
Talking snowman?

112
00:17:17.538 --> 00:17:20.666
- I haven't dealt with any
one so far.

113
00:17:20.666 --> 00:17:26.505
-But if it's not yellow snow,
I'd say not.

114
00:17:26.922 --> 00:17:28.340
- Then yes, that's me.

115
00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.800
-Grozav.

116
00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:33.136
-My life is like a Christmas special anyway.

117
00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:37.766
- Wow! This place really looks like a special edition! Cool.

118
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.393
- Mixed?

119
00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:42.938
- You don't have to live in it 24/7.

120
00:17:42.938 --> 00:17:45.482
- Hmm, my name is Casper.

121
00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:49.820
- Wait a minute! I made you.
Don't I have to give you my name?

122
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.947
- That's right, because I'm
a Snowman.

123
00:17:51.947 --> 00:17:54.241
- What do you want to call me?

124
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:56.577
- Hmmm, Casper!!

125
00:17:57.327 --> 00:18:00.414
- I'm Holly. Holly Jollymore.

126
00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:02.332
- Wow, your name is really...

127
00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:06.545
- I know, I know, it sounds like a Christmas carol.

128
00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:09.047
-Achieves new levels of wisdom.

129
00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:10.549
-I've heard worse...

130
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:14.052
- Ca: Stinky

131
00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:16.346
- And how would you like it if it was your name?

132
00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:25.314
-It wasn't working for me.

133
00:18:25.314 --> 00:18:26.565
-Exactly.

134
00:18:26.565 --> 00:18:28.942
-My parents make decorations for Christmas.

135
00:18:29.026 --> 00:18:32.821
- And because of that we had to pack and
all move here to Criss Mass Central.

136
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:33.822
- Sure, I'll give up all my friends.

137
00:18:36.992 --> 00:18:38.619
- Look at this.

138
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.708
- Wow, your people designed this??

139
00:18:44.917 --> 00:18:46.960
-It's... so embarrassing.

140
00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:50.756
-I bet you don't feel humiliated
because of your relatives.

141
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.221
- Oh, you have no idea.

142
00:18:58.263 --> 00:19:00.974
- Holly, are you coming?

143
00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.893
-Do you understand what I mean?

144
00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:04.061
- I have to help on this play
Christmas play.

145
00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:05.729
- Can I come too?

146
00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.649
- You wouldn't melt in the spotlight
hot lights at the theater?

147
00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:13.737
- Right... topi... that's right...
Can we go out again when you get back?

148
00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:16.156
- Sure. See you later!

149
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:22.079
- Puah! Now I'll have the song
stuck in my head all day.

150
00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:46.603
- Hey look!
They're looking for ghosts!

151
00:19:46.812 --> 00:19:48.897
- But we can't scare people!

152
00:19:49.106 --> 00:19:52.442
- We don't have hunting permits!

153
00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:58.490
- He's scared! But because we have him
Casper to scare someone...

154
00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:03.704
...we'd better have a prank ready.

155
00:20:04.538 --> 00:20:13.297
- And... we wouldn't think of
of scaring someone without a permit.

156
00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:14.548
- Right?

157
00:20:14.965 --> 00:20:17.050
- OK.

158
00:20:24.141 --> 00:20:28.312
- Leave me alone, you scary ghost!

159
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.313
- Boo!

160
00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:37.487
- Whoa, we gotta scare the boy
the bad guy with the supplies!
What a good deal!

161
00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.781
- No good ghost. Next!

162
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:44.161
- Guys, here's a rehearsal for a play!

163
00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:47.915
- It's all fake.
We're the only ghosts here!

164
00:20:48.332 --> 00:20:53.545
- That's an insult!
If they want to see something scary...

165
00:20:53.754 --> 00:20:57.132
...we'll show them scary.

166
00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:06.683
- Boo!

167
00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:19.613
- Thanks for the special effects,
but we're looking for something else...

168
00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.950
... a little less steamy. Next!

169
00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:38.799
- It's too distracting for the other actors.
Next!

170
00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:41.718
- Next!

171
00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:43.804
- But I'm not finished.

172
00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:47.349
- Yes, you are, you're not attractive.

173
00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:54.690
- OK, thank you all for trying,
you're all wonderful people.

174
00:21:54.857 --> 00:21:59.236
- But that leaves the three
ghosts in the last group.

175
00:21:59.653 --> 00:22:02.155
- But what do you think of us?

176
00:22:02.573 --> 00:22:05.909
- I'm sorry, but you're not quite...

177
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.412
... believable as ghosts.

178
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.166
- But... - But... we really are ghosts!

179
00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:15.502
- You actors...

180
00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:18.839
- Such dedication!

181
00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:21.341
- I'm a character too.

182
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:26.972
- I'm not Scrooch.
- No kidding?

183
00:22:27.181 --> 00:22:31.351
- It's Noel Jellymoore, the star of the play.

184
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.522
- This is my wife,
Carol, the director of the play.

185
00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:38.859
- And our daughter, Holly.

186
00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:40.944
- Protesting!

187
00:22:41.153 --> 00:22:45.532
- You know, on our first day in Chris,
Noel and I went door to door...

188
00:22:45.741 --> 00:22:50.120
...and I personally offered everyone in town
a homemade Christmas cookie...

189
00:22:50.329 --> 00:22:53.457
- And a good picture of
two fruitcakes!

190
00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:57.211
...but I don't remember
meeting the three of you.

191
00:22:57.419 --> 00:23:00.130
- I just got here today.

192
00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:05.552
- The whole town is busy,
there's no room at the inn.

193
00:23:05.761 --> 00:23:08.889
- I know! You can come and stay with us.

194
00:23:09.723 --> 00:23:11.391
- We insist!

195
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.145
- Shelter for needy travellers,
in the holiday season...

196
00:23:15.354 --> 00:23:18.899
...represents exactly
the essence of the Christmas spirit!

197
00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:21.401
- And you are
the most needy!

198
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.654
- No offense, but until
you improve your performance,

199
00:23:23.904 --> 00:23:26.824
you won't get any
a job as a ghost.

200
00:23:27.032 --> 00:23:32.246
- But...we are ghosts!
-See?

201
00:23:33.705 --> 00:23:38.085
-This is it!
- Keep your attitude positive.

202
00:23:38.502 --> 00:23:44.341
- Too bad about the poor audition.
-Yes, better luck next time!

203
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.261
- Maybe a rehearsal or two will help.

204
00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:55.185
- Now, let's take you ghosts,
home, and scare up a room.

205
00:24:26.466 --> 00:24:28.177
- Uh, excuse me a minute!

206
00:24:28.177 --> 00:24:30.637
- You forgot to wash your hands,
dear?

207
00:24:30.846 --> 00:24:33.557
- Use the new scented soap
pine soap we have!

208
00:24:33.765 --> 00:24:38.562
- That's exactly what the house needed
this one: more pine!

209
00:24:40.022 --> 00:24:41.481
- Uh, you got company?

210
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:44.818
- Just some weak actors, invi-
who were asked by Mom and Dad to stay with us.

211
00:24:45.027 --> 00:24:49.406
- We have the usual breakfast:
roast turkey.

212
00:24:49.406 --> 00:24:51.283
-It looks great! -Yeah.

213
00:24:51.492 --> 00:24:56.079
- I'd invite you in, but
you'd melt from the heat.

214
00:24:56.079 --> 00:24:58.999
-There's nothing more embarrassing than
wetting your chair at dinner.

215
00:24:59.208 --> 00:25:01.919
- Here's some ice cream.

216
00:25:02.127 --> 00:25:03.337
- Hurry up Holly, cut the slices.

217
00:25:03.587 --> 00:25:07.758
- See you later!
-But...

218
00:25:21.522 --> 00:25:23.607
- It's good to see such a healthy appetite!

219
00:25:23.815 --> 00:25:27.361
- Without health, what would we do?

220
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:31.532
- So how do you make those amazing
special effects?

221
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.285
- Carol, maybe they're not allowed
to tell us.

222
00:25:35.494 --> 00:25:40.082
-You know how secretive tourists are
with new types of technology.

223
00:25:40.916 --> 00:25:45.712
- Yeah, it's all a secret.

224
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:49.049
- And what's the deal with everyone
all these trees?

225
00:25:49.258 --> 00:25:52.386
- Do you have a dog
with a weak bladder?

226
00:25:53.011 --> 00:25:55.305
- They're for Christmas!

227
00:25:56.139 --> 00:25:58.642
- Oh, so that's it.

228
00:25:58.851 --> 00:26:00.519
- So what's the big deal?

229
00:26:00.519 --> 00:26:04.898
- What's not to love about Christmas?
We love decorations...

230
00:26:05.107 --> 00:26:08.235
... and we like to exchange
gifts

231
00:26:08.443 --> 00:26:12.406
...but most of all we like how
brings friends together.

232
00:26:12.614 --> 00:26:15.742
- Got it.

233
00:26:19.496 --> 00:26:23.250
- It is not fair. Why have
they have a family dinner?

234
00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:27.421
- Maybe if you weren't lying to her, you'd be
and you were in there, you son of a bitch!

235
00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:32.009
- You're talking to yourself.

236
00:26:32.217 --> 00:26:34.928
- You have to tell him the truth!

237
00:26:35.137 --> 00:26:38.682
- Remember when you were a girl scout?
The oath you took?

238
00:26:38.891 --> 00:26:41.185
- On the honour of the scout!

239
00:26:41.393 --> 00:26:43.687
- What if he's afraid of me?

240
00:26:43.896 --> 00:26:47.024
- And you're gonna keep lying?
What kind of friend does that?

241
00:26:47.232 --> 00:26:49.943
- I'll fix it. I'll tell her at
the right time!

242
00:26:50.152 --> 00:26:53.280
- What?

243
00:26:58.285 --> 00:27:01.622
- That thing looks good.

244
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.707
- You think they use
real chestnuts?

245
00:27:03.916 --> 00:27:07.461
- You know what's good? Some sage and
roasted garlic in the mix...

246
00:27:09.546 --> 00:27:11.215
- I have to get over it.

247
00:27:17.054 --> 00:27:20.182
- Iach, coconut.

248
00:27:21.225 --> 00:27:25.395
- Is the food gone?

249
00:27:25.604 --> 00:27:27.481
- I think so, yes.

250
00:27:27.689 --> 00:27:30.609
- I've never seen anyone
eat so much.

251
00:27:30.817 --> 00:27:34.154
- Holly, don't be rude!

252
00:27:34.363 --> 00:27:35.823
- Sorry.

253
00:27:35.823 --> 00:27:37.908
- Hey, it's about time somebody
rude.

254
00:27:38.116 --> 00:27:40.619
-All these manners I
produce gas.

255
00:28:02.099 --> 00:28:05.644
- I feel like I'm going crazy,
you're not scaring anyone.

256
00:28:05.853 --> 00:28:11.275
- We can have a scare
little scare, no one will know.

257
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.654
-Whoa, what's going on?

258
00:28:15.863 --> 00:28:20.033
-Even I don't do that much
gas.

259
00:28:20.242 --> 00:28:25.455
-There's no gas! I'm getting a
message on my laptop.

260
00:28:25.664 --> 00:28:28.584
-You and your tools!

261
00:28:28.792 --> 00:28:32.754
- Hey, I got the eee-mail.

262
00:28:32.963 --> 00:28:37.426
-I'll connect to the world
wired(weird) web", to check it out.

263
00:28:41.722 --> 00:28:51.315
- I'm checking you three, and it would
better follow my orders
about the scares.

264
00:28:51.523 --> 00:28:52.983
- Yes, sir!

265
00:28:53.192 --> 00:28:55.485
- No scares here, sir!

266
00:28:55.694 --> 00:29:00.699
-And this message comes with an attachment.

267
00:29:00.908 --> 00:29:07.581
-Level here, he's watching you
three and reporting to me.

268
00:29:09.666 --> 00:29:20.093
I'll let you know if this apology of
ghosts scare anyone.

269
00:29:20.302 --> 00:29:25.098
-And you'd better hurry,
because your time is running out.

270
00:29:25.307 --> 00:29:28.852
- Casper's gonna scare somebody
any time now.

271
00:29:29.061 --> 00:29:33.023
-And then we'll get back
our hunting licenses back, right?

272
00:29:33.232 --> 00:29:38.237
-You count on Casper to save you
the papers?

273
00:29:45.118 --> 00:29:49.289
-Next time we're in-
meet, I might be able to reinstate you

274
00:29:49.498 --> 00:29:52.835
... or disintegrate

275
00:29:53.043 --> 00:29:59.091
-And don't forget:
Fear the darkness!

276
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:50.184
-Golden Rule No.253:

277
00:30:50.392 --> 00:30:56.023
-The spur does not count if
you apologize for it.

278
00:31:17.085 --> 00:31:19.588
-Golden Rule No.829:

279
00:31:19.796 --> 00:31:24.176
-It doesn't count if you freak out
alone.

280
00:31:25.219 --> 00:31:28.972
-Casper, you're hopeless!

281
00:31:29.181 --> 00:31:31.892
-Silence, I tried!

282
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.271
-We'll all end up alone
in the dark!

283
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.982
-Oh, what a pity!

284
00:31:41.485 --> 00:31:44.822
-Don't make me call Kabbash!

285
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:50.244
-That's more like it.

286
00:31:54.414 --> 00:32:00.462
-Ah, you damned spy! I hate
to be on this rat's tongue.

287
00:32:00.671 --> 00:32:04.424
-Do you really like to wear
the costumes.

288
00:32:04.633 --> 00:32:10.681
-to welcome you properly into the house
our house, we brought you some pudding.

289
00:32:10.889 --> 00:32:12.349
-What's that?

290
00:32:12.558 --> 00:32:18.188
-Hmm, we're not really
sure, nobody is.

291
00:32:18.397 --> 00:32:23.610
-But it's very "christian".
That's good enough for us.

292
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:35.289
-No, there are only a few days left
shocking days until Christmas.

293
00:32:35.497 --> 00:32:40.294
-We're finished if Casper
doesn't scare someone off quickly.

294
00:32:40.502 --> 00:32:45.924
-But when it comes to scaring,
Casper's smokier than Frenso.

295
00:32:46.133 --> 00:32:49.469
-Pity we couldn't turn it
Casper into another ghost.

296
00:32:49.678 --> 00:32:54.683
-or... turn another
ghost into Casper.

297
00:32:54.892 --> 00:33:00.939
-like our nephew Spooky.
He looks like his cousin Casper.

298
00:33:01.148 --> 00:33:04.902
-If he can
and scaring the hell out of people.

299
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.447
-Da.
There are some pictures of them right here

300
00:33:08.655 --> 00:33:11.366
... in the Book of Fear
of the Academy of Ghosts.

301
00:33:11.575 --> 00:33:21.585
-Yes, you have to bring Casper,
I mean bad Casper.

302
00:33:21.585 --> 00:33:25.339
-Sure, we have a plan.

303
00:33:25.547 --> 00:33:32.221
-We make him come here,
and replace him with Casper, then...

304
00:33:32.429 --> 00:33:35.140
-Snivel sees how he scares
someone to death, then...

305
00:33:35.349 --> 00:33:39.520
-Do we have to share the pudding with him?

306
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.856
- "We have to share", NOUUU!

307
00:33:43.065 --> 00:33:49.112
-We get our hunting permits
back and avoid being left in...

308
00:33:49.321 --> 00:33:50.572
...darkness.

309
00:33:50.781 --> 00:33:56.203
-Frivites! The Book of Fear gives
the phone number in New York.

310
00:33:56.411 --> 00:33:59.540
-Call my little
smelly phone!

311
00:34:19.142 --> 00:34:22.479
-Nice view, isn't it?

312
00:34:22.688 --> 00:34:26.233
-What happened to all those people
down there, they look like ants!

313
00:34:26.233 --> 00:34:32.906
-Ooo, Spooky! I'm sure they're
two Uncle Sue's and cousins and grandparents...

314
00:34:33.115 --> 00:34:34.992
...and sisters and...

315
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:43.750
-What do you want?!? Oh, I'm honored that
you called me!

316
00:34:43.959 --> 00:34:47.087
-It's the Ghost Trio,
my idols.

317
00:34:47.713 --> 00:34:53.760
-Ah, how about you come in
Chrismassachussets, scare

318
00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:56.263
...someone for us?

319
00:34:56.471 --> 00:35:00.434
-You want me to come in
into your group?

320
00:35:00.434 --> 00:35:04.188
-You're just what we need. -You're just what we need.
No one else could do it

321
00:35:04.396 --> 00:35:05.022
...besides you

322
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.941
-We'd love for you to come.

323
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:12.529
-Daa, and we don't lie because
we're not desperate.

324
00:35:14.615 --> 00:35:18.160
-This is the best break on
I get,

325
00:35:18.368 --> 00:35:22.122
my chance to be in
Team Screamers!

326
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.795
-Ah, but... -I have to
to think about it.

327
00:35:29.004 --> 00:35:30.464
-I'll call you back.

328
00:35:30.672 --> 00:35:34.426
-You can only get
think about leaving New York?

329
00:35:34.635 --> 00:35:35.886
-This is a super town.

330
00:35:36.094 --> 00:35:37.137
-Bronx is mixed.

331
00:35:37.346 --> 00:35:42.142
-But not butter, nor salt,
nor the tossing of the target.

332
00:35:42.351 --> 00:35:45.270
-I need more
opportunities to scare.

333
00:35:45.479 --> 00:35:48.398
-This offer to enter
Ghost Trio is my chance

334
00:35:48.607 --> 00:35:50.484
for professionals.

335
00:35:50.692 --> 00:35:52.569
-What makes you so sure?

336
00:35:52.778 --> 00:35:58.826
-I'm putting my foot down:
We're going to Chrismass

337
00:35:59.034 --> 00:36:02.371
...if you agree.

338
00:36:02.579 --> 00:36:12.381
-You were right, the actors
these actors are weird.

339
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:14.883
-They didn't scare you, did they?

340
00:36:15.092 --> 00:36:17.803
-I love weirdness,
like Halloween.

341
00:36:18.011 --> 00:36:19.263
-That's quite a celebration!

342
00:36:19.471 --> 00:36:22.599
-I'm glad you mentioned Halloween,
because

343
00:36:22.808 --> 00:36:25.102
-What? How come it's not...

344
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:26.144
-I can explain.

345
00:36:26.353 --> 00:36:27.187
-The truth is...

346
00:36:27.396 --> 00:36:32.609
-Of course! You're a Snowman
so you don't leave tracks in the snow.

347
00:36:32.818 --> 00:36:35.529
-Yeah..., sure, that sounds good.

348
00:36:35.737 --> 00:36:40.534
-You're all screwed up now.

349
00:36:42.202 --> 00:36:46.373
-You're fucked!

350
00:37:00.554 --> 00:37:01.805
-Did you hear that?

351
00:37:02.222 --> 00:37:04.725
-Looks like Casper really scares her!

352
00:37:04.933 --> 00:37:08.478
-Maybe not after all
need Spooky.

353
00:37:12.232 --> 00:37:15.152
-I knew it was too good to be
true.

354
00:37:15.569 --> 00:37:20.574
-If you want something done right
you have to do it yourself.

355
00:37:20.782 --> 00:37:25.162
-or... fooling someone else
to do it, and then

356
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.622
...to piss him off.

357
00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.333
-So Spooky's not joining us?

358
00:37:29.541 --> 00:37:33.921
-You want to be the Ghost Quartet?

359
00:37:34.129 --> 00:37:36.632
-No, it's too hard to pronounce.

360
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:45.599
-After Spoky gets us out of here
we say bye!

361
00:37:49.353 --> 00:37:50.812
-Say it!

362
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.732
-You are officially the champion of the universe
at snow fights.

363
00:37:53.941 --> 00:37:56.860
-Ura!

364
00:37:57.069 --> 00:37:58.946
-It's great to be with someone normal.

365
00:37:59.154 --> 00:38:02.699
-Nobody ever called me that before.
Keep up the compliments!

366
00:38:02.866 --> 00:38:04.368
- Seriously!

367
00:38:04.576 --> 00:38:07.704
-This time of year,
my folks won't leave me alone.

368
00:38:07.913 --> 00:38:10.624
-I want to get involved in everything
they do.

369
00:38:10.833 --> 00:38:13.544
-sounds like a burden.

370
00:38:13.752 --> 00:38:15.629
-Can I tell you a secret?

371
00:38:15.838 --> 00:38:18.131
-You swear you won't tell anyone?

372
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.174
-Da.Jur.

373
00:38:19.383 --> 00:38:22.719
-I like one thing about the holidays.

374
00:38:22.928 --> 00:38:26.473
-To make congratulations.
I'll make one for you.

375
00:38:26.682 --> 00:38:28.976
-Seriously? Cool!

376
00:38:29.184 --> 00:38:34.815
-If you tell anyone what I told you
I like at Christmas, you'll

377
00:38:35.023 --> 00:38:37.317
...you get a lump...
- Okay, okay, it's a secret.

378
00:38:37.526 --> 00:38:41.905
-You know something, Casper? I feel like I can
trust you.

379
00:38:42.114 --> 00:38:47.327
-Trust is good. Confidence and
sincerity and all that...

380
00:38:47.536 --> 00:38:48.579
-Listen, I...

381
00:38:48.787 --> 00:38:50.455
-Holly, Grandma's on the phone!

382
00:38:50.664 --> 00:38:53.167
-Shut up, I have to go.
See you later!

383
00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:55.669
-Dar I...

384
00:38:55.878 --> 00:38:58.589
-So, you're telling
the right time?

385
00:38:59.006 --> 00:39:00.257
-Shut up!

386
00:39:22.779 --> 00:39:26.950
-It's from the ghost office.

387
00:39:29.036 --> 00:39:32.789
-And New York City.

388
00:39:32.998 --> 00:39:35.083
-New York City?

389
00:39:38.629 --> 00:39:46.553
-Level, I just found out it's
film festival downtown.

390
00:39:46.762 --> 00:39:49.890
-I'm out of here!

391
00:39:58.232 --> 00:40:03.237
-Hello, uncles! I wanted to
make a classy entrance.

392
00:40:03.445 --> 00:40:07.825
-Yes, 3rd grade. Spooky was
too cheap to pay

393
00:40:08.033 --> 00:40:10.327
...for another stamp.

394
00:40:10.536 --> 00:40:12.830
-You always wanted to travel
with scary mail!

395
00:40:13.041 --> 00:40:17.401
-I like someone to fly
for me once in a while.

396
00:40:19.082 --> 00:40:22.434
-I've come to join you.
What do you need?

397
00:40:22.603 --> 00:40:24.905
-Well, let's see. First of all...

398
00:40:25.116 --> 00:40:28.048
...we need you to get rid of
this silly hat.

399
00:40:28.049 --> 00:40:29.301
-My hat...

400
00:40:29.512 --> 00:40:30.974
-Taci!

401
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.975
-But it was the trademark of the scarecrow.

402
00:40:41.186 --> 00:40:45.798
-We're not looking for a scary guy,
more like a Casper guy.

403
00:40:45.967 --> 00:40:50.369
-It's time for a top secret initiation.

404
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.370
-He's cute.

405
00:40:52.043 --> 00:40:55.143
-Yes, very hash, hash.
-It makes sense to me.

406
00:40:55.354 --> 00:40:57.866
-Yes, foreigners are not allowed.

407
00:41:06.435 --> 00:41:15.392
-I take a hint, a house doesn't
makes a fool of me. Later Spooky!

408
00:41:46.127 --> 00:41:48.744
-Hi! -Hi! I'm Casper.

409
00:41:50.005 --> 00:41:53.357
-Hi. -Yeah, it's Caaassper.

410
00:41:55.626 --> 00:42:00.028
-Hi. I'm Caaassper.

411
00:42:02.114 --> 00:42:04.206
-Hi! -Hi! I'm Casper.

412
00:42:11.698 --> 00:42:13.367
-Hi! -Hi! I'm Casper.

413
00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:17.518
-And you're gonna freak out
that you'll lie to me all your life.

414
00:42:20.864 --> 00:42:22.956
-There, I think he's got them. -Oh, yeah.

415
00:42:23.587 --> 00:42:33.387
-I'm disgusted with myself. After this
I'll be in the Fantasy Trio, right?

416
00:42:34.228 --> 00:42:36.919
-Daa, sir.

417
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.062
-We'll treat you like one of them.

418
00:43:05.919 --> 00:43:07.999
-Carol, is that you?

419
00:43:08.626 --> 00:43:10.076
-Holly?

420
00:43:10.917 --> 00:43:13.849
-God, we're glad you're back, Snivel!

421
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:18.630
-Casper's ready to scare again.

422
00:43:18.631 --> 00:43:22.613
-You'll be amazed.
It's a totally new ghost.

423
00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.870
-That's it.
It's Casper, the angry ghost.

424
00:44:56.451 --> 00:44:58.459
-He didn't look scared to me.

425
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:08.950
-I'm not gonna talk about the incident
incident ever again.

426
00:45:27.747 --> 00:45:29.377
-Alo.

427
00:45:29.588 --> 00:45:32.730
-What are you doing?
-Just some Christmas cookies.

428
00:45:33.571 --> 00:45:36.503
-Do you like scary cupcakes?

429
00:45:36.924 --> 00:45:41.074
-I don't think Christmas cookies are
too scary.

430
00:45:41.915 --> 00:45:44.427
-Probably just the Halloween cookies.

431
00:45:45.226 --> 00:45:46.898
-I scare you?

432
00:45:47.319 --> 00:45:49.411
-No, no, you look nice. -No, no, you look nice.

433
00:45:49.832 --> 00:45:52.134
- DON'T HANG UP THE PHONE!

434
00:45:52.555 --> 00:45:56.075
-Oh God, I wouldn't hang up on anyone.

435
00:45:56.496 --> 00:45:57.958
- Wait. Let me give you the recipe.

436
00:45:57.959 --> 00:46:01.521
-Take 3 cups butter, half a cup
of butter, a cup of chocolate...

437
00:46:01.732 --> 00:46:03.614
-It doesn't matter!

438
00:46:04.035 --> 00:46:07.765
-All right. -Bye, then.
Merry Christmas!

439
00:46:14.428 --> 00:46:17.108
-O my God, I forgot the salt!

440
00:46:17.781 --> 00:46:22.771
-This leads to a "manual" approach.

441
00:46:24.857 --> 00:46:26.949
-Hopa, I'm half-naked!

442
00:46:33.219 --> 00:46:36.109
-O, she looked "very" scared.

443
00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.622
-Spooky, are you here?

444
00:46:39.883 --> 00:46:41.975
-I'm in the bowl.

445
00:46:48.232 --> 00:46:52.382
-I had to scare her.
What's wrong?

446
00:46:52.803 --> 00:46:55.315
-I was... mixed up.

447
00:47:03.658 --> 00:47:07.808
-Ah, how sweet and innocent you look.

448
00:47:08.229 --> 00:47:11.581
-This scare will be easy.

449
00:47:24.527 --> 00:47:26.199
-Hello, Casper!

450
00:47:26.578 --> 00:47:30.350
-You should have screamed.
Don't you think I'm scary?

451
00:47:30.771 --> 00:47:32.863
-No. Why would anyone think that?

452
00:47:34.532 --> 00:47:39.522
-God, I don't understand. You can't
scare even a little girl.

453
00:47:40.363 --> 00:47:44.933
-You said about Casper that
he's improved his scares.

454
00:47:45.144 --> 00:47:47.446
He's as incompetent as ever.

455
00:47:47.867 --> 00:47:52.437
-What a disappointment!
Let's get out of here!

456
00:47:56.611 --> 00:47:59.963
-It's a nightmare. And not a good one.

457
00:48:00.384 --> 00:48:01.636
-Are you okay?

458
00:48:02.057 --> 00:48:07.887
-Look: I can accept that I'm not
scary, but I don't want your pity.

459
00:48:08.308 --> 00:48:12.458
-All right. You obviously have some problems.

460
00:48:12.879 --> 00:48:15.811
But I have a surprise for you.
- Who cares?

461
00:48:16.232 --> 00:48:19.164
-Valea! I'm out of shape.

462
00:48:19.375 --> 00:48:22.895
-Glumesti? Because it's not funny.

463
00:48:23.526 --> 00:48:27.088
-You're telling me? I'm sick of you
and your crazy family!

464
00:48:27.509 --> 00:48:33.759
-They're not normal!
-Hey! They're my family and I love them!

465
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.490
- Well, someone has to love them.
You guys are just as weird.

466
00:48:37.911 --> 00:48:41.263
-Then I won't bother you anymore
from now on.

467
00:48:42.104 --> 00:48:45.204
-Hm, exciting.

468
00:48:53.547 --> 00:48:54.547
-Hi Holly

469
00:48:57.095 --> 00:48:59.187
-We're offering your Christmas card.

470
00:49:00.238 --> 00:49:01.280
-Hey, why did you do that?

471
00:49:02.121 --> 00:49:04.591
-I think it's the kind of thing
a freak would do.

472
00:49:05.852 --> 00:49:08.784
-Holly!
-Leave me alone!

473
00:49:16.287 --> 00:49:17.539
-Hello, sweeties.

474
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:18.540
-?

475
00:49:19.003 --> 00:49:26.091
-Your eyes are very funny.
You're a very good Casper.

476
00:49:26.512 --> 00:49:29.654
-Oh, thank you. I do my best.

477
00:49:29.865 --> 00:49:32.545
-What are you doing here in Chriss?

478
00:49:32.966 --> 00:49:37.158
-A, mainly I get bored in
this cute little town.

479
00:49:37.579 --> 00:49:40.049
I want to go back to New York.

480
00:49:41.718 --> 00:49:42.718
-Uh, okay.

481
00:49:47.724 --> 00:49:48.724
-Uh, you're not coming with me?

482
00:49:49.649 --> 00:49:52.581
-Uh, no. But thanks for asking.

483
00:49:53.002 --> 00:49:56.522
I have to stay here and see what happened to Holly.

484
00:49:56.943 --> 00:49:58.825
-Holly? Who's Holly?

485
00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:03.018
-She's a very pretty girl.
We get along very well.

486
00:50:03.817 --> 00:50:08.009
Only now she's upset
at me, I don't know why.

487
00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:11.362
-Yes? -Yes? Well, she's not the only one.

488
00:50:11.514 --> 00:50:17.520
That you ignored me is bad enough.
And now you say she's cute.

489
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:23.014
I can't even see your face anymore.
You're a big joke.

490
00:50:31.357 --> 00:50:32.357
-Who wants poultry milk?

491
00:50:33.444 --> 00:50:35.116
While it's hot.

492
00:50:38.614 --> 00:50:39.614
-I'll get it later.

493
00:50:40.866 --> 00:50:43.462
-Oo. Are you all right, dear?

494
00:50:44.714 --> 00:50:45.714
-It's not important.

495
00:50:45.967 --> 00:50:48.059
I don't want to spoil your Christmas.

496
00:50:49.728 --> 00:50:50.728
-Holly, look at me!

497
00:50:51.182 --> 00:50:54.324
Your father and I
we love Christmas, it's true.

498
00:50:54.493 --> 00:50:57.215
And maybe we go too far sometimes.

499
00:50:57.216 --> 00:51:00.568
But you matter more, always.

500
00:51:03.077 --> 00:51:05.547
-He's a friend of mine.

501
00:51:06.382 --> 00:51:09.314
Or at least I have
I thought my friend was.

502
00:51:09.315 --> 00:51:12.667
And suddenly he's a bastard.
I don't get it.

503
00:51:14.336 --> 00:51:17.646
-Well, maybe the friend
your friend's in trouble at home.

504
00:51:17.857 --> 00:51:23.729
-Sometimes a villain is someone
who doesn't know how to say what he feels.

505
00:51:24.564 --> 00:51:27.664
-Well, I'll give it another chance.

506
00:51:27.665 --> 00:51:32.277
-This is... he... it's a boy?!

507
00:51:35.197 --> 00:51:36.827
-We'd like to meet him.

508
00:51:37.911 --> 00:51:43.951
-The bird's beard is there if you want it.
It'll help you sleep.

509
00:51:44.582 --> 00:51:49.776
Unless you become lactose intolerant.
Then there will be cramping and bloating.

510
00:51:49.861 --> 00:51:51.869
-Good night! -Good night!

511
00:52:04.383 --> 00:52:05.383
"I thought I knew you"

512
00:52:07.052 --> 00:52:09.984
"How could I have been wrong?"

513
00:52:10.222 --> 00:52:18.992
"Maybe you have problems you don't
know how to say"

514
00:52:19.395 --> 00:52:22.327
"But I care."

515
00:52:23.964 --> 00:52:26.896
"And I can be your girlfriend"

516
00:52:28.787 --> 00:52:31.887
"You can tell me anything"

517
00:52:32.308 --> 00:52:37.340
"Even if it's crazy or bad"

518
00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:41.059
"Even if you're angry or sad"

519
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:45.882
"I can be your girlfriend"

520
00:52:46.232 --> 00:52:50.256
'"I will never let you down"

521
00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:54.617
"Honesty to the end"

522
00:52:55.248 --> 00:52:59.440
"Win or lose try again"

523
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:06.939
"Because I can be your girlfriend."

524
00:53:10.693 --> 00:53:13.205
-Where does this music come from?

525
00:53:23.633 --> 00:53:24.633
"Special Ballads for Christmas"

526
00:53:25.885 --> 00:53:27.389
-Holly.

527
00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:34.034
-Look, I have to tell you something.

528
00:53:34.455 --> 00:53:37.177
-Why were you such a jerk before?

529
00:53:37.598 --> 00:53:38.221
-When?

530
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:40.523
-When you yelled at me!

531
00:53:40.734 --> 00:53:42.406
-What are you talking about?

532
00:53:42.617 --> 00:53:46.143
-Okay. -Forget it. I've been trying
to talk to find out what your problem is.

533
00:53:46.354 --> 00:53:49.076
I can help you with them.
That's what friends do.

534
00:53:49.287 --> 00:53:52.387
I just wanted you to tell me the truth.

535
00:53:56.559 --> 00:53:59.911
-Well, do you want the truth? Here it is:

536
00:54:00.122 --> 00:54:03.660
You won't like it and you won't
want to be my girlfriend.

537
00:54:03.871 --> 00:54:08.665
-Casper, shouldn't you be
climb out the window, it's too dangerous.

538
00:54:17.007 --> 00:54:19.561
How do you do that?

539
00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.830
Since when do snowmen fly?

540
00:54:24.091 --> 00:54:26.603
-I'm not a Snowman.
I told a stupid lie because

541
00:54:26.772 --> 00:54:29.284
I wanted you to be my girlfriend.

542
00:54:31.788 --> 00:54:33.502
I'm a... ghost.

543
00:54:33.881 --> 00:54:35.343
-A ghost?!

544
00:54:35.764 --> 00:54:37.016
-A ghost. You know...

545
00:54:39.265 --> 00:54:42.029
You trusted me
and I let you down.

546
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:43.030
I let everyone down.

547
00:54:44.534 --> 00:54:47.046
I'm sorry, Holly. Bye. Bye.

548
00:54:57.474 --> 00:55:02.464
-Aha! There you are, try
to hide from me.

549
00:55:02.885 --> 00:55:09.765
-Never. I was just admiring
Santa's scary expression.

550
00:55:09.959 --> 00:55:13.101
-Daaa, come closer and look!

551
00:55:25.615 --> 00:55:28.547
-And by the way, I reversed the engine
in Santa's pipe.

552
00:55:28.758 --> 00:55:34.585
It's a very powerful vacuum cleaner now,
so be careful!

553
00:55:34.796 --> 00:55:41.475
-Hey, you tricked me.
-Yeah, and you got sucked in. -Yeah. Get it?

554
00:55:41.475 --> 00:55:45.835
-We'll come back and set you free...
in a couple of years.

555
00:55:50.007 --> 00:55:53.359
-Turn around! Let me go!

556
00:55:55.028 --> 00:55:57.330
OK, you wanted it.

557
00:55:58.999 --> 00:56:05.039
Here, did you hear that?
It's loud in here.

558
00:56:13.382 --> 00:56:16.314
-Let me hear the recording one more time.

559
00:56:16.723 --> 00:56:17.723
-What's not to love about Christmas?

560
00:56:18.558 --> 00:56:23.380
We love decorations.
-And exchange gifts.

561
00:56:23.801 --> 00:56:28.161
But most of all we like how
brings friends together.

562
00:56:28.405 --> 00:56:30.875
-Hey, that's a good thing!

563
00:56:32.127 --> 00:56:36.739
-OK, I checked the list twice.

564
00:56:37.145 --> 00:56:41.925
-It's Christmas Eve.
We need to think of an idea fast.

565
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.532
We find an idea to ruin Christmas quickly.

566
00:56:47.367 --> 00:56:48.367
-This is it!

567
00:56:55.459 --> 00:57:00.071
Then the horrible triou-lui
came up with a damned idea.

568
00:57:00.492 --> 00:57:05.524
Ghosts with vile spirits
have come up with a diabolical idea.

569
00:57:06.768 --> 00:57:16.757
Everyone in Chriss loved Christmas,
except for the Fantastic Trio.

570
00:57:33.441 --> 00:57:40.955
Probably his head
big head wasn't quite caught.

571
00:57:42.216 --> 00:57:45.946
Or perhaps the sheets
were too tight.

572
00:57:46.157 --> 00:57:51.609
But I think it's most likely that
...they were bastards.

573
00:57:58.901 --> 00:58:04.521
Okay, now we wait.
I've been down every hole.

574
00:58:04.745 --> 00:58:09.323
-I think this chimney is too tight.

575
00:58:26.007 --> 00:58:29.359
With a twist under the fireplace,
he slithered like a snake.

576
00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:34.765
He stole the steak, even the cakes.

577
00:58:35.186 --> 00:58:38.118
-Hey guys, he exclaimed.

578
00:58:38.354 --> 00:58:40.194
Did someone say "cake"?

579
00:58:40.825 --> 00:58:50.614
And then resolutely after a twist of the head,
he saw a young man awake from bed.

580
00:58:51.035 --> 00:58:57.287
Who saw some big eyes
in red Christmas clothes.

581
00:59:06.464 --> 00:59:07.506
-Hey, you just scared someone. -Hey, you just scared someone.

582
00:59:07.717 --> 00:59:09.599
You have broken a basic rule.

583
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:12.070
-So what if?

584
00:59:12.323 --> 00:59:18.141
Snivel is not here to spy on us.
We can do what we want.

585
00:59:19.393 --> 00:59:24.803
That's right, if Kabbash doesn't know
nothing happens to us.

586
00:59:26.265 --> 00:59:35.659
... and sticking his fingers up his nose
climbed up the chimney.

587
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:42.763
Your gifts were taken by
the Jollimore family. Come and get them!

588
00:59:48.173 --> 00:59:58.383
-When the whole town has to come here to get their
to pick up the presents stolen by the Jollimore family.

589
00:59:58.594 --> 01:00:00.434
-Yes, friendships are over.

590
01:00:00.477 --> 01:00:05.689
-And when they get here we'll make sure
they're in for some nasty surprises.

591
01:00:06.124 --> 01:00:11.954
-And besides they'll see their presents
blown away by my special bumba with a clock.

592
01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:14.281
-''Clockwork?''

593
01:00:14.282 --> 01:00:17.382
-Like a time bomb,
but scarier.

594
01:00:17.593 --> 01:00:21.113
It'll blow them away hard.

595
01:00:21.525 --> 01:00:27.794
-Gentlemen, to a well ruined Christmas!

596
01:00:28.215 --> 01:00:31.945
-That's not fair!
-Excuse me? -No.

597
01:00:32.156 --> 01:00:35.298
I know I don't scare anyone anymore,

598
01:00:35.514 --> 01:00:39.202
but you have gone too far.
It's not even about scaring anyone anymore.

599
01:00:39.455 --> 01:00:41.547
You're just plain mean.

600
01:00:41.787 --> 01:00:45.307
-Big words for someone
who can't even scare a fly.

601
01:00:45.518 --> 01:00:49.080
-Hey! -I can scare very well,
but not with this outfit.

602
01:00:49.271 --> 01:00:51.573
Let me be myself!

603
01:00:51.784 --> 01:00:56.984
-Get that through your stupid head:
WE DON'T WANT YOU!!

604
01:00:57.027 --> 01:01:00.337
-Yeah, we can't wait to be Casper.

605
01:01:00.548 --> 01:01:03.648
-But I thought I'd join you guys.

606
01:01:03.859 --> 01:01:06.583
The Fantastic Trio... and the scares...

607
01:01:06.794 --> 01:01:08.879
The evil little ghost.

608
01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:14.095
-Ooo, guess what? Well you thought wrong.

609
01:01:14.306 --> 01:01:20.562
Now beat it, you jerk!
Turn around when you can scare a kitty cat.

610
01:01:22.648 --> 01:01:26.819
-I'll show them I can scare a kitty cat!

611
01:01:46.006 --> 01:01:47.678
-What?

612
01:02:08.743 --> 01:02:09.533
-I scared you, didn't I?

613
01:02:09.996 --> 01:02:15.001
-Yes, my heart almost stopped.

614
01:02:15.212 --> 01:02:20.217
-I'm still good at it. Did you hear that? I'm back!

615
01:02:21.469 --> 01:02:24.968
So, how are you, Casper?

616
01:02:25.221 --> 01:02:28.522
-What's with the disguise?
Why are you dressed like me?

617
01:02:28.733 --> 01:02:30.818
I'm a loser...

618
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:33.532
I've destroyed everything.

619
01:02:33.953 --> 01:02:38.124
-I'll fill you in, but more
first I'll explain the purpose.

620
01:02:38.335 --> 01:02:43.340
Maybe we can get rid of each other
each other out of the doghouse.

621
01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:45.846
-Hey, Boyl!

622
01:02:50.018 --> 01:02:54.189
And that's the whole scheme.

623
01:02:59.831 --> 01:03:02.532
-It's only an hour till sunrise.

624
01:03:02.743 --> 01:03:06.494
We have to stop the Trio.
Can you help me?

625
01:03:06.705 --> 01:03:12.961
-Well, I'd like to get back at them
for driving me away... okay, I'll help you.

626
01:03:13.172 --> 01:03:16.307
-It's time to teach the Trio a lesson.

627
01:03:16.518 --> 01:03:21.724
I can't believe I was worried
that I'd let them down all this time.

628
01:03:21.935 --> 01:03:24.020
First task: get them out of the house!

629
01:03:24.231 --> 01:03:26.512
-But what about a good scare?

630
01:03:26.723 --> 01:03:29.226
-Nothing scares the three of them!

631
01:03:29.437 --> 01:03:31.522
Nothing except...

632
01:03:32.993 --> 01:03:37.164
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a plan.

633
01:03:39.668 --> 01:03:42.969
-Next time I see you, I want
you to be you.

634
01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.526
-The boom is set to 20 minutes.

635
01:03:58.527 --> 01:04:01.030
-The millers will be here soon.

636
01:04:01.745 --> 01:04:07.584
-Everything's ready to give the sunnies
the fright of their lives.

637
01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:15.521
Guys, if we're going out, we're going out in style.

638
01:04:22.616 --> 01:04:25.119
-Have you heard anything?

639
01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:31.376
-Yeah, sounds like an evil spirit in pain
headaches.

640
01:04:31.377 --> 01:04:32.377
-It has to be the people of Oradea.

641
01:04:32.378 --> 01:04:39.516
Well, boys, let's welcome them like this
they won't forget us too soon.

642
01:04:49.944 --> 01:04:56.200
-You three have made
something against the city?

643
01:04:56.201 --> 01:04:57.201
-No.

644
01:04:57.202 --> 01:05:06.621
Leave the Jelimoore family alone! I'm
and their daughter is very sweet.

645
01:05:06.832 --> 01:05:07.832
-What?

646
01:05:12.838 --> 01:05:14.342
-There's nothing going on here, Mr Kabbash.

647
01:05:26.016 --> 01:05:27.856
-What hat...?

648
01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:41.369
-Save yourselves!!!
-Flee!

649
01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.797
-I think it went well.

650
01:05:55.213 --> 01:05:56.969
-I scared the hell out of him.

651
01:05:56.970 --> 01:06:01.141
-That's it, isn't it? -Yeah.

652
01:06:01.142 --> 01:06:02.940
I can't scare a kitten, can I?

653
01:06:15.454 --> 01:06:17.294
-Hey, what's this?

654
01:06:17.295 --> 01:06:19.800
Christmas cookies?!

655
01:06:20.632 --> 01:06:21.632
-Look at that! -What?

656
01:06:25.387 --> 01:06:28.781
-That kabbashu was a fake!

657
01:06:29.397 --> 01:06:33.157
-Yes, let's go back and teach them a lesson!

658
01:06:41.082 --> 01:06:44.845
-We showed them
some stuff about freaking out!

659
01:06:49.852 --> 01:06:50.852
-Oops!

660
01:06:55.858 --> 01:06:57.950
-Ooo, I see double!

661
01:07:04.459 --> 01:07:11.135
-Stop, nobody but me
should blow the Kabbash whistle!

662
01:07:36.162 --> 01:07:38.212
-Watch out! Kabbash is here!

663
01:07:38.624 --> 01:07:42.387
-This time you've really screwed up.

664
01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:55.731
-You really think we're stupid, don't you?

665
01:07:56.141 --> 01:08:00.069
-Hey, Mr. Kabbash, you're an asshole
big fat ha ha.

666
01:08:04.493 --> 01:08:08.883
-Oh, he's getting angry.
We'd better calm him down.

667
01:08:13.265 --> 01:08:15.350
-What does that mean?

668
01:08:16.602 --> 01:08:23.698
-We'll have a nice winter after...
that nasty fall.

669
01:08:24.119 --> 01:08:27.252
-What a nasty fall?

670
01:08:27.421 --> 01:08:29.092
-Asta!

671
01:08:39.106 --> 01:08:42.031
-That will be a lesson to you!

672
01:08:44.117 --> 01:08:45.117
-Aaa, Stretch!

673
01:08:45.118 --> 01:08:47.462
-Not now Stinky! -Not now Stinky!

674
01:08:47.667 --> 01:08:53.506
I have to teach these
what respect for the elderly is!

675
01:08:53.717 --> 01:08:56.220
-Uh, I don't think that was a doll.

676
01:08:56.431 --> 01:09:03.521
-Don't be a dickhead. If it hasn't been quilted,
it means it was the real one.

677
01:09:08.722 --> 01:09:10.394
-KABBASH!!!

678
01:09:10.395 --> 01:09:16.651
-How dare you?
All the cheek ends now!

679
01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:25.828
The sun rises.
You all know what that means.

680
01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:32.085
It's Christmas, and your time is up.

681
01:09:34.588 --> 01:09:42.096
And because it's the holidays, I'm planning
a free trip for the two of you.

682
01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:45.644
-It's not even necessary.

683
01:09:46.275 --> 01:09:50.446
I'd like to hit until it hurts.

684
01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:04.205
-Level, you're driving.

685
01:10:04.626 --> 01:10:07.117
-Wait! You misunderstood, Kabbash.

686
01:10:07.244 --> 01:10:10.260
-You dare to correct me? -No.

687
01:10:12.346 --> 01:10:13.346
-I blew the whistle.

688
01:10:13.347 --> 01:10:17.518
I called you to tell you that
I scared someone.

689
01:10:17.771 --> 01:10:22.572
We scared them, I mean we scared them
the Fantastic Trio.

690
01:10:24.868 --> 01:10:29.039
-You scared this group off
of experienced scarecrows?

691
01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.960
Snivel, is it true?

692
01:10:33.212 --> 01:10:36.132
-Well... technically yes.

693
01:10:36.511 --> 01:10:42.767
Casper scared the trio.
They flew away screaming like babies.

694
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:55.281
-All right. Conditions of punishment
have been met.

695
01:10:59.453 --> 01:11:05.709
-Level, back up
the trio their hunting permits.

696
01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:11.132
-Well, dddar... sir only Casper
did a good job.

697
01:11:11.342 --> 01:11:14.679
Do we have to release the Trio?

698
01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:18.851
-Dare you comment on my orders? -No.

699
01:11:23.023 --> 01:11:27.194
-No sir, your super height...
what hat...?

700
01:11:27.615 --> 01:11:35.957
Uh, Mr. Kabbash, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir.
come and have a look.

701
01:11:36.168 --> 01:11:44.300
Looks like someone ignored orders
your orders against the scares.

702
01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:49.312
-We would never scare anyone...

703
01:11:49.523 --> 01:11:53.898
-Daa, we haven't even
think of scaring anyone.

704
01:11:53.899 --> 01:11:56.402
-No? -No?!
-Nooo.

705
01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:59.323
-No, we wouldn't think of it.

706
01:11:59.534 --> 01:12:03.705
-Here's your wickedness!

707
01:12:03.916 --> 01:12:08.087
-That's it! You defied me again!

708
01:12:08.298 --> 01:12:13.303
-I think they wanted to retreat noisily.
One last scare...

709
01:12:14.303 --> 01:12:18.474
before they were sent into darkness.

710
01:12:18.727 --> 01:12:24.746
-With noise? No, louder.

711
01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:32.041
-No, no, you misunderstand.

712
01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:36.252
-What is it now?

713
01:12:36.253 --> 01:12:41.258
-Well, you see, it's for refreshment.

714
01:12:41.847 --> 01:12:46.018
-Hai let her. The whole room
is full of traps.

715
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:49.569
Who are they for?

716
01:12:50.821 --> 01:12:53.741
-Uh, good question.

717
01:12:53.952 --> 01:12:56.455
-For ourselves!

718
01:12:56.666 --> 01:13:01.671
-Yes, for ourselves.
Because...

719
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:06.261
are a Christmas present for you, Kabbash.

720
01:13:06.472 --> 01:13:12.311
-Sure, because we know how much you like them,
don't we?

721
01:14:35.730 --> 01:14:36.730
In the spirit of fear.

722
01:14:36.731 --> 01:14:38.399
-Uh, say it!

723
01:14:38.652 --> 01:14:42.823
-None of this was meant to scare.

724
01:14:43.034 --> 01:14:44.702
In the spirit of giving.

725
01:14:44.913 --> 01:14:47.416
-No sir, no scares.

726
01:14:55.759 --> 01:14:57.427
-Ha, ha, not bad.

727
01:15:01.187 --> 01:15:05.358
-Give them back their passes!

728
01:15:08.239 --> 01:15:11.576
-It's about time!
-God, what I missed you!

729
01:15:11.787 --> 01:15:15.124
-This is the best day of my life
of my afterlife.

730
01:15:15.335 --> 01:15:19.506
-Returns: Casper v-a slavat
your miserable sheets,

731
01:15:19.717 --> 01:15:25.973
but remember, you'll hear from Kabbash again.

732
01:15:26.184 --> 01:15:28.687
Or Snivel, so...

733
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:38.030
-What's going on here?

734
01:15:38.283 --> 01:15:40.786
-It's a noise that wakes the dead.

735
01:15:40.997 --> 01:15:44.334
-I see it's your ghost actor friends.

736
01:15:45.796 --> 01:15:47.881
Oh, nice costumes!

737
01:15:54.138 --> 01:15:58.309
That's even cooler. Special effects!

738
01:15:58.310 --> 01:16:04.566
What a cheesy look.
He'd be perfect for the role of the ghost.

739
01:16:04.777 --> 01:16:08.948
Does anyone know how I can get in touch with him?
-Nooo!

740
01:16:09.369 --> 01:16:12.706
-Carol, darling, look at this.

741
01:16:12.917 --> 01:16:18.339
In the spirit of giving.
What a wonderful surprise!

742
01:16:20.008 --> 01:16:23.762
-You didn't have to get us so many presents.

743
01:16:24.183 --> 01:16:30.845
-They're actually all Criss's.
Soon the whole town will be coming for them.

744
01:16:30.846 --> 01:16:37.111
-That's cute.
We're gonna have the best Christmas party ever.

745
01:16:38.783 --> 01:16:42.954
-I'm glad everyone in town wants
will have a merry Christmas!

746
01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:45.668
That's the most important thing. I think.

747
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:48.589
Has anyone seen Holly?

748
01:16:48.968 --> 01:16:50.219
-Hello Casper.

749
01:16:51.888 --> 01:16:53.556
-Hi Holly! -Hi Holly!

750
01:16:55.018 --> 01:16:57.521
I'm sorry I lied to you.

751
01:16:57.522 --> 01:17:02.527
You left me talking!
-I'm sorry about that, too.

752
01:17:02.738 --> 01:17:05.241
-Well, you apologized.

753
01:17:07.327 --> 01:17:10.868
When we found out that our guests are
ghosts like you,

754
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.503
I thought I was planning something.

755
01:17:14.008 --> 01:17:19.013
I've been watching what happens.
And I know how you saved the family Christmas.

756
01:17:19.224 --> 01:17:23.395
-And yet I feel sorry for...
-Dest. Thanks for the congratulations.

757
01:17:23.606 --> 01:17:27.783
And I know it's no big deal, but...
-Whoa, it's...

758
01:17:27.994 --> 01:17:32.159
-Crăciunistic?
-Total. But it's OK.

759
01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:37.792
-You've already given me the most
beautiful gift of all: a friend.

760
01:17:38.003 --> 01:17:43.008
-You know, you're the only person
I know who doesn't make that sound crazy.

761
01:17:45.514 --> 01:17:49.685
-Uh, is it...?
-Yes, mistletoe.

762
01:17:58.028 --> 01:18:03.450
-I think it's time to make
to exchange gifts.

763
01:18:08.039 --> 01:18:10.542
-Whoa, my hat!

764
01:18:10.708 --> 01:18:17.798
-Yeah, I looked everywhere until I found it
in a dumpster across town.

765
01:18:18.429 --> 01:18:22.600
-Uh, I don't have anything for you Boyle.

766
01:18:22.811 --> 01:18:24.896
-Of course you do.

767
01:18:25.107 --> 01:18:30.112
I got the old Spooky back.
I like you just the way you are.

768
01:18:30.323 --> 01:18:36.162
-Let's go back to New York.
Class I.

769
01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:43.881
-Whoa, under Spooky's tough mask,
she's a friendly girl.

770
01:18:44.092 --> 01:18:46.177
Very friendly.

771
01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:52.227
-I love you. We'll always be together
my darling.

772
01:18:55.982 --> 01:19:00.987
-Mom, Dad, I'd like to introduce you
my friend Casper.

773
01:19:01.198 --> 01:19:07.454
Holly's friends, they're ours too.
Merry Christmas, Casper!

774
01:19:12.877 --> 01:19:16.214
-I can't stand all this merriment.

775
01:19:16.425 --> 01:19:17.885
-You're getting sick.

776
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:23.055
Although it may be from the 12 cakes
fruitcake I just ate.

777
01:19:23.098 --> 01:19:25.141
-Let's get out of here.

778
01:19:25.184 --> 01:19:28.062
-Dragon, it's snowing here.

779
01:19:28.105 --> 01:19:31.859
-No problem dear,
I'll turn on the fan.

780
01:19:37.699 --> 01:19:38.699
-I'm feeling a little dismembered.

781
01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:41.203
-I've got the pieces!

782
01:19:41.369 --> 01:19:43.872
-I feel like a phlegm.

783
01:19:44.167 --> 01:19:51.257
-How nice! White Christmas in the house!
-I love surprises!

784
01:19:52.719 --> 01:19:56.056
-I like happy endings!

785
01:19:56.267 --> 01:20:00.021
-And I love a musical number!

786
01:20:00.022 --> 01:20:04.193
-Merry Christmas to all,
and a Happy New Year!
