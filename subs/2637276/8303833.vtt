1
00:00:34.477 --> 00:00:35.937
We are often told

2
00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:41.651
that happily-ever-afters
exist only in the pages of fairy tales

3
00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:45.321
and in the naive minds
of sheltered innocents.

4
00:00:45.488 --> 00:00:49.533
And yet, on this bright,
sunny, Boston afternoon,

5
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.663
a talking teddy bear
is about to marry his girlfriend,

6
00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.623
proving two things.

7
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.876
Happy endings can come true for anyone.

8
00:00:59.043 --> 00:01:02.505
And America doesn't give
a shit about anything.

9
00:01:03.047 --> 00:01:05.049
Do you, Tami-Lynn McCafferty,

10
00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.345
take this teddy bear to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

11
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.930
I do.

12
00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:12.556
And do you, Ted,

13
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.185
take this woman to be your lawfully
wedded wife?

14
00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:18.020
Fuckin' A right, I do!

15
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:22.108
Then, by the power vested in me,

16
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:25.069
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

17
00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:26.436
You may kiss the bear.

18
00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:52.096
Ladies and gentlemen, your newlyweds!

19
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:02.815
Teddy, this is the best day of my life!

20
00:02:03.274 --> 00:02:04.817
I just love you so much.

21
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.527
I love you, too, baby.

22
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.280
I'm gonna go fifty shades of bear
on you tonight.

23
00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:10.656
Let's go get shit-faced!

24
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.940
Okay!

25
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:15.401
Thank you.

26
00:02:19.582 --> 00:02:21.792
Hey, congrats, you mofos.

27
00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:22.877
Oh, hey, Guy.

28
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.545
Beautiful ceremony.

29
00:02:24.712 --> 00:02:26.808
Oh, Thank you so much
for being a part of it.

30
00:02:26.964 --> 00:02:28.679
Hey, this is my new boyfriend, Rick.

31
00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:29.842
How you doing?

32
00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:30.968
Good, good.

33
00:02:31.135 --> 00:02:35.056
He's a gourmet chef, So he knows how
to toss a salad.

34
00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:41.979
Rick and I are actually about
to tie the knot.

35
00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:44.065
Oh, you guys are getting married?

36
00:02:44.148 --> 00:02:46.130
No, we're just gonna
go home and tie our dicks together.

37
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.568
- Ha! Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

38
00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:48.986
Deal.

39
00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:58.662
Hey, buddy.
You okay, there?

40
00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.122
You look a little down.

41
00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:03.064
Are you still shaking off that hangover from
the bachelor party?

42
00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:04.794
Oh!
That's nice.

43
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.913
Oh, my god, She's fucking begging for it!

44
00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:09.882
She's totally
begging, get it, get in there.

45
00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:12.009
Look at her.
She wants it bad!

46
00:03:12.176 --> 00:03:13.260
Oh, yeah.
She wants more

47
00:03:13.344 --> 00:03:15.596
than just a fucking pizza delivery, huh?

48
00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.682
That's bigger than the average bear
right there, I tell you.

49
00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.624
You know what's fucked up? Dude, that's
somebody's fucking daughter!

50
00:03:21.644 --> 00:03:24.105
Oh, shit!
Jesus! Come on!

51
00:03:25.356 --> 00:03:28.400
I'm fine, I was thinking about Lori.

52
00:03:28.984 --> 00:03:31.153
Oh, Johnny, come on, man.

53
00:03:31.237 --> 00:03:33.739
It's been six months since you guys
got divorced.

54
00:03:33.823 --> 00:03:35.699
I know, I know.
It's just that...

55
00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:38.035
Being back in that church again.

56
00:03:38.702 --> 00:03:41.018
I mean, everything seemed like it was
gonna be so perfect.

57
00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:42.686
Yeah, well, you're not the first guy

58
00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:43.906
to marry the wrong girl.

59
00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.752
Hey, hey!
Big day, huh, bud?

60
00:03:47.044 --> 00:03:50.881
You guys wanna celebrate with a little
something else, hmm?

61
00:03:51.048 --> 00:03:53.300
Oh, uh, no, thanks, Sam.
Tami-Lynn would kill me

62
00:03:53.384 --> 00:03:55.004
if I did drugs on our wedding day.

63
00:03:55.052 --> 00:03:56.679
Ah, she won't notice.

64
00:03:56.762 --> 00:03:59.056
I just did a line with a dude
in the men's room

65
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.559
and I bet you can't even spot him.

66
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.600
Yeah, I'm gonna pass.

67
00:04:12.528 --> 00:04:15.322
I'm steppin' out with my honey

68
00:04:15.406 --> 00:04:17.575
Can't be bad to feel so good

69
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:20.035
Never felt quite so sunny

70
00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:21.996
So I keep on knockin' wood

71
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.415
Yeah, steppin' out with my baby

72
00:04:24.582 --> 00:04:26.834
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right

73
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:29.545
Ask me when will the day be

74
00:04:29.712 --> 00:04:33.007
The big day may be tonight

75
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.842
This is the best day of my life!

76
00:07:25.596 --> 00:07:27.745
I'm starving, What the hell are
you doing over there?

77
00:07:27.765 --> 00:07:28.807
I'm curing cancer.

78
00:07:28.974 --> 00:07:31.248
I'm cooking your fucking steak.
What do you think I'm doing?

79
00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:32.311
What do I think you're doing?

80
00:07:32.436 --> 00:07:34.251
I think you're bleeding us dry,
is what I think you're doing.

81
00:07:34.271 --> 00:07:37.941
Look at this, look at this.
$129 at Filene's Basement.

82
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.090
What are you buying over
there, Tami? Gold bars?

83
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.759
I need clothes for work. All right, Teddy?

84
00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:44.345
What do you mean?
You wear a smook, you're a fucking cashier.

85
00:07:44.365 --> 00:07:45.407
Yeah? So are you!

86
00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:48.307
Yeah, exactly! And I'm not going out
and buying designer shit!

87
00:07:48.327 --> 00:07:49.527
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

88
00:07:49.578 --> 00:07:51.727
You're just buying weed,
you're just buying drugs.

89
00:07:51.747 --> 00:07:52.748
You should fucking talk!

90
00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:55.981
I was talking, I was just talking, just now,
until you interrupted me.

91
00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:57.274
Well, I have to interrupt you or else

92
00:07:57.294 --> 00:07:58.295
I never get to fucking say anything!

93
00:07:58.379 --> 00:07:59.380
Are you gonna let me finish talking?

94
00:07:59.463 --> 00:08:00.464
You're always cutting me off!

95
00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:02.262
Are you gonna let me finish talking?

96
00:08:02.966 --> 00:08:04.406
It's important to look good at work.

97
00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:06.575
I am trying to climb the
corporate fence, here!

98
00:08:06.595 --> 00:08:08.035
Nobody's in there to look at your ass!

99
00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.286
You're acting like an asshole!

100
00:08:09.306 --> 00:08:10.891
Oh, what am I acting like, Tami?

101
00:08:10.974 --> 00:08:12.456
You're acting like a fucking asshole!

102
00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:14.124
Like an asshole! That's
what you're acting like!

103
00:08:14.144 --> 00:08:17.086
You don't got to dress like Elizabeth Taylor
to put a yam in a plastic bag!

104
00:08:17.106 --> 00:08:19.358
I am the face of the business! Okay?

105
00:08:19.483 --> 00:08:21.256
The face of the business?
So get the fuck off my case!

106
00:08:21.276 --> 00:08:23.654
Jesus Christ! Listen to
you! You're delusional!

107
00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:26.136
I should've married Robert
DiCicco. I really should've.

108
00:08:26.156 --> 00:08:27.638
Fine! Fine! Go torture that asshole!

109
00:08:27.658 --> 00:08:28.909
He treated me good!

110
00:08:28.992 --> 00:08:32.746
And he had a dick!
He had an awesome dick!

111
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.999
Oh, newsflash! Boston
whore has seen Italian penis.

112
00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:38.315
What the fuck did you just call me, fucker?

113
00:08:38.335 --> 00:08:39.711
What did you fucking say?

114
00:08:39.795 --> 00:08:41.088
Jesus! What the fuck?

115
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:43.173
You wanna call me a whore?

116
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.425
You wanna throw shit?

117
00:08:44.508 --> 00:08:45.781
Yeah, I wanna fucking throw shit!

118
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:46.844
I'll fucking throw shit!

119
00:08:46.885 --> 00:08:49.138
Oh, Wow, There, see!
How do you like that?

120
00:08:49.513 --> 00:08:50.597
I'm scared, Teddy!

121
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:52.996
I'm really fucking scared of you,
you little fucking bear!

122
00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:54.309
Shut the fuck up!

123
00:08:54.393 --> 00:08:55.853
Oh, for Christ's sake!

124
00:08:56.186 --> 00:08:57.729
Hey, you shut the fuck up!

125
00:08:57.813 --> 00:08:59.253
Why don't you come down
and make me, tough guy?

126
00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:00.399
Yeah, why don't you come up here

127
00:09:00.482 --> 00:09:01.839
and make me come down there, tough guy?

128
00:09:01.859 --> 00:09:04.091
I am gonna come up there
and I'm gonna kick your fucking ass!

129
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.551
Yeah, why don't you try it, asshole?

130
00:09:05.571 --> 00:09:07.364
Get your ass up here and kick my ass!

131
00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:10.013
Shut the fuck up, you stupid bitch!

132
00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:10.993
Hey, shut up, lady!

133
00:09:11.076 --> 00:09:13.036
Run the fuck back to Russia, you whore!

134
00:09:13.203 --> 00:09:14.455
Get the fuck out of here!

135
00:09:14.538 --> 00:09:15.824
People are trying to sleep!

136
00:09:15.873 --> 00:09:16.874
God damn it!

137
00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:18.157
Shut the fuck up!

138
00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:20.566
- Hey, I'm really sorry!
- Yeah, me, too.

139
00:09:20.586 --> 00:09:21.920
She's worse than us.

140
00:09:22.004 --> 00:09:23.380
Yeah, she's our enemy now.

141
00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:33.114
Have you guys at least tried
marriage therapy?

142
00:09:33.223 --> 00:09:35.392
Oh, God, yeah.
It was a frigging disaster.

143
00:09:35.476 --> 00:09:37.978
$250 and we didn't learn a goddamn thing.

144
00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:39.897
$250? Dude,
that's ridiculous!

145
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.670
I mean, doesn't your insurance cover
that or something?

146
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.548
Nah, Tami-Lynn tried to sign up for
Obamacare on the Internet,

147
00:09:44.568 --> 00:09:45.883
but I came back five minutes later,

148
00:09:45.903 --> 00:09:47.342
she was looking at black cocks.

149
00:09:47.362 --> 00:09:48.969
It seems like every time you go online,

150
00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:50.637
you're two clicks away from black cocks.

151
00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:51.857
Look.

152
00:09:51.909 --> 00:09:54.578
See, I'll Google "Grand Canyon.

153
00:09:54.786 --> 00:09:57.289
Here. Look, it says,
"Did you mean black cocks?

154
00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.438
I don't know, man.
I got to do something

155
00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:01.043
or my marriage is gonna collapse,

156
00:10:01.418 --> 00:10:02.711
Here you go, guys.

157
00:10:02.794 --> 00:10:04.421
We're gonna be closing in a few,

158
00:10:04.588 --> 00:10:06.111
but I'm going to this after-hours thing

159
00:10:06.131 --> 00:10:07.988
at my friend's apartment,
if you wanna join.

160
00:10:08.008 --> 00:10:11.136
Oh, thanks, Allison, But l got an
early day tomorrow.

161
00:10:11.261 --> 00:10:12.596
Oh, okay.

162
00:10:13.597 --> 00:10:16.558
Well, if you change your mind,
here's the address.

163
00:10:18.644 --> 00:10:20.311
I put my cell number on there, too.

164
00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:25.359
Oh, my God!
Are you fucking kidding me?

165
00:10:25.442 --> 00:10:26.485
What?

166
00:10:26.568 --> 00:10:27.799
What do you mean, What?
After hours?

167
00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:30.200
Jesus, Johnny, she totally wants
to sleep with you.

168
00:10:30.364 --> 00:10:31.448
I'm not into it.

169
00:10:31.532 --> 00:10:33.430
John, you've been saying that for over
a year-and-a-half

170
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.390
about every chick that
throws herself at you.

171
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.808
You got to get back in the game, man!

172
00:10:36.828 --> 00:10:38.143
No, don't start this shit, all right?

173
00:10:38.163 --> 00:10:39.728
Look, I wasted six years of my life

174
00:10:39.748 --> 00:10:41.230
with the wrong girl and I got burned.

175
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.250
I'm not gonna make that same
mistake again.

176
00:10:43.293 --> 00:10:45.108
Jesus, Johnny, you don't got
to marry Allison.

177
00:10:45.128 --> 00:10:47.361
You just got to bang her and maybe
pee on her a little.

178
00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:48.590
What?

179
00:10:48.757 --> 00:10:51.718
It's always good to find new
ways to surprise your lover.

180
00:10:51.802 --> 00:10:53.428
Yeah, I got to take a leak.

181
00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:57.474
Sorry, Allison, I tried.

182
00:10:57.641 --> 00:11:00.936
It's okay, I just wish he wasn't
so goddamn cute.

183
00:11:01.103 --> 00:11:02.818
Yeah, Hey, can I get a Jack Daniel's

184
00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:04.565
with just a splash of Grey Goose?

185
00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:06.713
Wish I could help you, but we're closing.

186
00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:09.007
Come on, one drink and I promise
I won't tell anybody

187
00:11:09.027 --> 00:11:11.488
that Jay Leno comes in here
for gay bathroom sex.

188
00:11:11.613 --> 00:11:14.074
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
Get off of me!

189
00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:15.993
Sorry, my mistake.

190
00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:25.877
There we go.
Thanks a lot, come again.

191
00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:33.844
Hey.

192
00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:35.095
Hello.

193
00:11:35.304 --> 00:11:39.308
I'd, uh, like to ask a few questions about
this breakfast cereal.

194
00:11:39.641 --> 00:11:41.852
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Box of Trix.

195
00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:43.145
That's right.

196
00:11:43.228 --> 00:11:47.357
I've been led to understand that Trix are
exclusively for children.

197
00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:48.891
Is that correct?

198
00:11:49.234 --> 00:11:52.779
I... I mean, they say, uh, "Trix
are for kids" in the commercials.

199
00:11:52.863 --> 00:11:54.239
Uh-huh, Uh-huh.

200
00:11:54.656 --> 00:11:56.825
And is that enforced by law?

201
00:11:57.492 --> 00:11:59.494
Uh, not to my knowledge, no.

202
00:12:00.037 --> 00:12:03.874
So if I purchase these Trix,
there'll be no trouble?

203
00:12:04.249 --> 00:12:06.376
No, No, you...
You should be fine.

204
00:12:07.085 --> 00:12:09.755
You do understand that I myself
am not a child?

205
00:12:10.047 --> 00:12:12.382
Uh, I was able to sniff that out, yeah.

206
00:12:14.217 --> 00:12:16.646
Okay, I'm going to bring these back
to my apartment.

207
00:12:16.928 --> 00:12:19.056
Uh, yeah, yeah.
You'll... You'll be okay.

208
00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:22.059
And, uh, I won't be followed?

209
00:12:22.392 --> 00:12:25.604
Uh, no, that's...
That's not in our budget here.

210
00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:30.182
Hey.

211
00:12:30.442 --> 00:12:32.944
I won't forget what you've done
for me here today.

212
00:12:33.111 --> 00:12:34.905
I would prefer that you do.

213
00:12:40.744 --> 00:12:42.245
Jesus Christ.

214
00:12:52.881 --> 00:12:54.675
You two still not talking?

215
00:12:54.758 --> 00:12:55.884
No.

216
00:12:55.967 --> 00:12:58.158
Honest to God, Joy, I don't know
how to fix this.

217
00:12:58.178 --> 00:12:59.179
I mean, how the hell do you take

218
00:12:59.262 --> 00:13:01.078
a broken marriage and make it work again?

219
00:13:01.098 --> 00:13:04.393
Well, I'll tell you one way.
You have yourselves a baby.

220
00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:05.560
A baby?

221
00:13:05.644 --> 00:13:07.562
Uh-huh, Look at that.

222
00:13:07.646 --> 00:13:09.252
You see them two white niggas over there?

223
00:13:09.272 --> 00:13:11.233
Yeah, What?

224
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.026
Look at them.
They're so happy.

225
00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:15.821
Because they got that little baby
keeping them together.

226
00:13:15.987 --> 00:13:17.531
If they didn't have that baby,

227
00:13:17.614 --> 00:13:19.700
they'd just be two sad-ass white niggas

228
00:13:19.783 --> 00:13:21.593
waiting for Downtown Abbey to come on.

229
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.204
Why, you said it twice.
Is that an actual phrase?

230
00:13:24.287 --> 00:13:25.372
I'm telling you, Ted,

231
00:13:25.455 --> 00:13:28.583
y'all better have a baby
or your marriage is over, Trust.

232
00:13:38.427 --> 00:13:40.429
Uh, hey.

233
00:13:41.179 --> 00:13:42.514
Go away, Teddy.

234
00:13:42.597 --> 00:13:44.766
Tami, listen, I just
wanna talk to you, Okay?

235
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.456
Will you just listen
to me for one second?

236
00:13:46.476 --> 00:13:48.291
Why? So you can give me shit
about my clothes?

237
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:51.314
No! Look, I'm sorry about that,
okay? I'm sorry.

238
00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:53.233
I was an asshole and I didn't mean it.

239
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.735
You know, whatever, Teddy.

240
00:13:54.818 --> 00:13:57.487
Tami, listen.
I love you.

241
00:13:58.113 --> 00:13:59.469
Okay? And...
And I don't want us

242
00:13:59.489 --> 00:14:01.680
to fight like we've been doing
the past few months.

243
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.494
I don't know, Teddy.
Something's got to change, you know?

244
00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:08.123
Because I can't do this no more.
It's too much.

245
00:14:08.248 --> 00:14:10.917
I know, I know, I know.
And... And that's why...

246
00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:14.171
I wanna have a baby.

247
00:14:15.756 --> 00:14:16.798
You do?

248
00:14:16.965 --> 00:14:18.091
Yeah.

249
00:14:18.175 --> 00:14:20.510
A baby? Like really?

250
00:14:20.677 --> 00:14:21.636
Yeah.

251
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.972
See, I think, if we got a kid to love,

252
00:14:24.055 --> 00:14:26.266
it'll teach us how to
love each other again.

253
00:14:26.516 --> 00:14:28.351
Oh, my God, Teddy.

254
00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:30.459
You better not be messing with me.

255
00:14:30.479 --> 00:14:32.002
I swear to God, not messing with you.

256
00:14:32.022 --> 00:14:33.642
I think you'd make an awesome mom.

257
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.192
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding me?

258
00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:37.323
I would, like, kick so much ass at mommin'!

259
00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:38.800
So what do you say?
We all good?

260
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.322
Yes! Oh, I love you!

261
00:14:40.405 --> 00:14:41.605
I love you so much!

262
00:14:41.698 --> 00:14:43.533
Oh, baby, I love you, too!

263
00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:46.272
- Let's make a baby!
- Let's make a baby!

264
00:14:55.837 --> 00:14:57.652
- Okay, you ready?
- Oh, shit, yeah, yeah, yeah.

265
00:14:57.672 --> 00:14:59.279
- Here it comes,
- Okay, okay, I'm ready.

266
00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:02.552
Let's all go to court

267
00:15:04.137 --> 00:15:07.307
Let's go make some law now

268
00:15:07.474 --> 00:15:09.392
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

269
00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:11.603
Some law now

270
00:15:11.686 --> 00:15:12.729
I say we go to court!

271
00:15:12.813 --> 00:15:14.013
Yes, let's go to court!

272
00:15:14.064 --> 00:15:15.796
We're a bunch of assholes who take up

273
00:15:15.816 --> 00:15:17.859
a whole hallway with our conversation.

274
00:15:19.319 --> 00:15:21.488
Hey, you lawyer guys

275
00:15:21.571 --> 00:15:25.575
You don't know me and
Johnny are watching you

276
00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:27.911
While we're high

277
00:15:28.912 --> 00:15:30.539
That was fucking magic.

278
00:15:30.622 --> 00:15:32.791
That felt smooth.
That felt really smooth, Oh!

279
00:15:32.874 --> 00:15:34.084
So in the pocket.

280
00:15:34.459 --> 00:15:36.586
Hey, so, uh, listen, l got, uh...

281
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.338
I got some big news to tell ya.

282
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.830
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

283
00:15:39.923 --> 00:15:43.260
Tami-Lynn and I are gonna have a baby!

284
00:15:45.178 --> 00:15:46.930
Holy shit! You?

285
00:15:47.013 --> 00:15:48.662
Yeah, yeah, we talked about it today.

286
00:15:48.682 --> 00:15:50.372
Dude, that's fucking awesome!
Congratulations!

287
00:15:50.392 --> 00:15:51.393
Thank you!

288
00:15:51.476 --> 00:15:53.375
Wait, wait, wait, How... How...
How do you guys...

289
00:15:53.395 --> 00:15:57.107
yeah, that's the thing, We... We, uh...
We got to find a sperm donor.

290
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.277
And, um, I'm wondering, what do you think

291
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.195
Sam Jones would say if I asked him?

292
00:16:02.445 --> 00:16:04.656
You want Flash Gordon
to father your child?

293
00:16:04.739 --> 00:16:06.096
Yeah, I mean, do you think...

294
00:16:06.116 --> 00:16:07.848
Would that be weird?
Would he be freaked out if I...

295
00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:09.099
No, I think he'd be flattered!

296
00:16:09.119 --> 00:16:11.830
And plus, your baby
will be a fucking superhero!

297
00:16:11.913 --> 00:16:13.979
Well, that was the logic
I arrived at as well.

298
00:16:13.999 --> 00:16:15.208
Yeah, I say do it!

299
00:16:15.292 --> 00:16:17.023
All right, I'll shoot
him an e-mail right now,

300
00:16:17.043 --> 00:16:18.567
and see if I can stop by tonight.

301
00:16:18.587 --> 00:16:19.826
- You come with me?
- Sure.

302
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.089
All right, great.

303
00:16:23.383 --> 00:16:24.384
Shit.

304
00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:27.534
I can never get a signal in your
apartment, Hey, can I use your laptop?

305
00:16:27.554 --> 00:16:29.389
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

306
00:16:34.102 --> 00:16:35.302
What the fuck?

307
00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:37.729
Holy shit! Dude, what's the matter?
What happened?

308
00:16:37.772 --> 00:16:38.815
What's going on?

309
00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:40.817
There's so much porn!

310
00:16:40.984 --> 00:16:42.883
Well, what the hell are you doing looking
at my private shit?

311
00:16:42.903 --> 00:16:45.760
What are you talking about, private shit?
Johnny, it was wide open!

312
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.637
There are literally
thousands of files here!

313
00:16:47.657 --> 00:16:49.639
Well, I've been meaning
to clear some of that out.

314
00:16:49.659 --> 00:16:51.707
Jesus Christ, Look at
the organization here!

315
00:16:51.786 --> 00:16:54.497
Clockwise rim job.
Counterclockwise rim job!

316
00:16:54.706 --> 00:16:57.105
Yeah, well, sometimes you like seeing
the tongue go the other way!

317
00:16:57.125 --> 00:17:00.003
You sick bastard! Look at this!
Chicks with dicks?

318
00:17:00.295 --> 00:17:03.882
Oh, my God!
I have a disease, all right? I need help!

319
00:17:04.049 --> 00:17:06.573
There are no chicks with dicks, Johnny!
Only guys with tits!

320
00:17:06.593 --> 00:17:07.886
Oh, this is such a relief!

321
00:17:07.969 --> 00:17:10.327
I'm so glad I'm finally caught.
I wanted to be caught!

322
00:17:10.347 --> 00:17:13.121
Johnny, now you listen to me.
This is a wake-up call, all right?

323
00:17:13.141 --> 00:17:15.165
You got to get back out there
and meet somebody

324
00:17:15.185 --> 00:17:17.083
because you are spiraling
out of control here.

325
00:17:17.103 --> 00:17:19.753
All right, fine, I will, Just stop looking
at that shit, please!

326
00:17:19.773 --> 00:17:21.004
Johnny, I mean it, All right?

327
00:17:21.024 --> 00:17:23.089
The next chick you meet,
you are getting back in the game.

328
00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.309
Fine, I got it, Done.

329
00:17:24.361 --> 00:17:26.134
All right, Now, let's get rid of this.

330
00:17:26.154 --> 00:17:28.136
What do you mean?
We'll just delete the files!

331
00:17:28.156 --> 00:17:29.804
No, no, no, That shit can
always be recovered.

332
00:17:29.824 --> 00:17:31.826
We got to smash your
laptop with a hammer.

333
00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:39.459
All right, there, you happy?

334
00:17:39.542 --> 00:17:42.108
No, the circuits could still be
reconstructed if somebody worked at it.

335
00:17:42.128 --> 00:17:43.652
We got to bury it in the harbor.

336
00:17:58.353 --> 00:18:01.856
So, uh, basically that's it.
We need a sperm donor.

337
00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:03.358
So what do ya say?

338
00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:05.340
You'd really be helping me and Tami out.

339
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.861
No can do, my brother.

340
00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:08.571
Well...
Well, why not?

341
00:18:08.905 --> 00:18:11.074
Oh, look, I did a lot of blow in the '80s

342
00:18:12.409 --> 00:18:14.577
and my sperm count's a little low.

343
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.320
Oh, How low?

344
00:18:16.579 --> 00:18:17.779
One.

345
00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:18.832
One?

346
00:18:18.915 --> 00:18:22.752
Yeah, little fella's having his own
I Am Legend in my nut sack.

347
00:18:22.961 --> 00:18:24.421
Oh, Can we have that one?

348
00:18:24.504 --> 00:18:28.008
No! Gonna need it for protein
if I ever get lost at sea.

349
00:18:28.174 --> 00:18:30.573
Come on, guys, I mean,
are we done here? I got to go.

350
00:18:30.593 --> 00:18:33.722
That Sister, Sister marathon
ain't gonna watch itself.

351
00:18:34.431 --> 00:18:36.850
Can't believe it.
That son of a bitch!

352
00:18:36.933 --> 00:18:38.289
That was really selfish of him.

353
00:18:38.309 --> 00:18:39.749
I know, And after I watched his

354
00:18:39.769 --> 00:18:41.769
piece-of-shit movie,
like, a hundred times.

355
00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.180
God damn it!

356
00:18:44.399 --> 00:18:45.599
Ah!
Oh, shit!

357
00:18:51.114 --> 00:18:53.283
Johnny, please, just help me
do this, Okay?

358
00:18:53.366 --> 00:18:55.015
He's the only guy in the world
whose sperm

359
00:18:55.035 --> 00:18:56.349
is even close to Flash Gordon's.

360
00:18:56.369 --> 00:18:58.685
Ted, it's insane, We could get in
a lot of trouble.

361
00:18:58.705 --> 00:19:00.081
But not if nobody finds out.

362
00:19:00.165 --> 00:19:01.207
Look, look, John, John.

363
00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:03.626
We sneak into his house,
jerk him off in his sleep

364
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.692
and sneak out with the sperm.
It'll be easy!

365
00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:07.589
And think how awesome the baby will be.

366
00:19:08.173 --> 00:19:10.175
Would be a sweet-ass fucking baby.

367
00:19:11.468 --> 00:19:14.135
All right, I'll help you.
But we got to have a game plan.

368
00:19:26.232 --> 00:19:27.692
Just calm down.

369
00:19:29.778 --> 00:19:30.978
Yeah, can I help you?

370
00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.075
Hey! Um, are you,
uh, Tom Brady?

371
00:19:35.492 --> 00:19:36.493
Yeah.

372
00:19:36.618 --> 00:19:37.818
Um, hey. Um...

373
00:19:37.994 --> 00:19:38.953
Your neighbors called,

374
00:19:39.037 --> 00:19:40.602
and your air conditioner's
making a loud noise

375
00:19:40.622 --> 00:19:42.312
so I'm supposed to check out the unit.

376
00:19:42.332 --> 00:19:43.813
Uh, okay.
Yeah, it's around back.

377
00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:46.211
Okay, Um, I just may need
a signature in case

378
00:19:46.294 --> 00:19:48.247
I got to get some parts, for the billing.

379
00:19:48.546 --> 00:19:52.008
You could just, uh, write that to
John and Ted, Put number 12.

380
00:19:52.634 --> 00:19:55.492
And you're not a cheater.
I mean, I think your balls are perfect.

381
00:19:55.512 --> 00:19:57.347
It's around back.
All right, Yeah.

382
00:20:20.787 --> 00:20:22.539
Stupid idiot.

383
00:20:29.212 --> 00:20:30.588
Okay, Go, go, go!

384
00:20:47.063 --> 00:20:49.045
Take the damn raincoat off.
It's making too much noise.

385
00:20:49.065 --> 00:20:51.234
Piss off! I don't wanna get
any jizz on me!

386
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.456
Two League MVPs, four Super Bowl rings,

387
00:21:05.707 --> 00:21:08.293
guaranteed first ballot Hall of Famer.

388
00:21:08.418 --> 00:21:11.129
Now let's give him a handjob
into this red Solo cup.

389
00:21:11.254 --> 00:21:12.714
All right, Go ahead.

390
00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:15.262
Wait, what do you mean,
Go ahead? You got to do it.

391
00:21:15.592 --> 00:21:17.574
What are you talking about?
You're the one who needs the sperm.

392
00:21:17.594 --> 00:21:19.033
Yeah, but it's got to be a human hand.

393
00:21:19.053 --> 00:21:20.994
It's got to be skin on skin,
otherwise it doesn't work.

394
00:21:21.014 --> 00:21:22.412
No, it doesn't.
It's just friction.

395
00:21:22.432 --> 00:21:24.247
- Look, I've never done this before.
- Neither have I.

396
00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:26.207
- You do it to yourself.
- Yeah, but that's different.

397
00:21:26.227 --> 00:21:28.877
You're an adult with a poster of this guy
in your fucking room.

398
00:21:28.897 --> 00:21:30.707
You're telling me you don't want this?

399
00:21:30.732 --> 00:21:33.209
Yeah, I want it! You know I want it,
but I'm nervous.

400
00:21:33.276 --> 00:21:35.466
What if he doesn't like the way
I'm doing it? He deserves the best!

401
00:21:35.486 --> 00:21:36.613
Pull yourself together, for God's sakes.

402
00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:38.125
He's gonna love it.
Go, go, go!

403
00:21:39.032 --> 00:21:40.283
All right.

404
00:21:43.953 --> 00:21:45.997
Sweet God and baby Jesus.

405
00:21:47.165 --> 00:21:49.125
And that's at rest.

406
00:21:50.001 --> 00:21:51.127
What the hell?

407
00:21:51.211 --> 00:21:52.692
Mr. Brady, we just need
a moment of your time.

408
00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:54.194
What are you doing here?
Who are you?

409
00:21:54.214 --> 00:21:55.414
Get out of my house!

410
00:21:57.133 --> 00:21:58.333
Oh, God! Ahhh!

411
00:21:59.928 --> 00:22:00.970
Wait, Mr. Brady!

412
00:22:01.054 --> 00:22:02.889
Take your goddamn teddy bear with you!

413
00:22:04.641 --> 00:22:06.893
Holy shit!
Perfect spiral!

414
00:22:06.976 --> 00:22:08.453
Come on, let's get out of here!

415
00:22:17.445 --> 00:22:18.488
Shit!

416
00:22:18.655 --> 00:22:19.989
What the hell do we do now?

417
00:22:22.116 --> 00:22:23.598
Hey, Ted, let me ask you something.

418
00:22:23.618 --> 00:22:24.827
What's that?

419
00:22:25.328 --> 00:22:26.805
Why didn't you just come to me?

420
00:22:27.288 --> 00:22:28.519
What are you talking about?

421
00:22:28.539 --> 00:22:29.874
For the sperm.

422
00:22:30.208 --> 00:22:34.963
Oh. Johnny, you kidding me, man?
You were the first person I wanted to go to.

423
00:22:35.421 --> 00:22:37.090
But you've just been so bummed out

424
00:22:37.173 --> 00:22:38.373
over your divorce lately

425
00:22:38.424 --> 00:22:41.928
that I just... You know, I didn't want
to put you in an awkward position.

426
00:22:42.178 --> 00:22:43.660
And plus, after seeing your laptop,

427
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.204
I didn't think you had any left.

428
00:22:45.515 --> 00:22:48.017
Just so you know,
I'm totally willing to do it.

429
00:22:48.601 --> 00:22:51.896
Really? You'd...
You'd do that for me?

430
00:22:52.146 --> 00:22:54.575
Ted, you're my best friend.
I'd do anything for you.

431
00:22:55.191 --> 00:22:58.695
Besides, we just broke into Tom
Brady's house and tried to jerk him off...

432
00:22:58.778 --> 00:23:00.405
You're ready to be a parent.

433
00:23:00.905 --> 00:23:02.615
God...

434
00:23:02.699 --> 00:23:04.492
I don't know what to say.

435
00:23:04.701 --> 00:23:07.829
Johnny, thank you!
Thank you so much!

436
00:23:08.037 --> 00:23:10.790
Hey, thunder buddies for life, remember?

437
00:23:11.165 --> 00:23:13.001
Thunder buddies for life.

438
00:23:13.167 --> 00:23:15.929
Come on, We got to get out of here
before the cops show up.

439
00:23:15.962 --> 00:23:20.008
All units, we have a 3-17 on Maple
Drive, Area units, please respond.

440
00:23:20.174 --> 00:23:21.676
What's a 3-17?

441
00:23:21.843 --> 00:23:24.721
Someone's trying to steal
Tom Brady's jizz again.

442
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.402
- What is that?
- What?

443
00:23:39.485 --> 00:23:41.134
What are you doing?
I'm getting ready, dude.

444
00:23:41.154 --> 00:23:42.155
What do you mean you're getting ready?

445
00:23:42.238 --> 00:23:43.553
What are you doing to your hand?

446
00:23:43.573 --> 00:23:46.222
I'm doing this for you, I'm getting ready.
I got to go in and perform.

447
00:23:46.242 --> 00:23:47.890
You got your hand on your dick.
What are you doing?

448
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.225
I'm trying to get it half hard,

449
00:23:49.245 --> 00:23:50.810
so when I get in there
I could just bust it out.

450
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.687
Sitting out here in public, jerking off?

451
00:23:52.707 --> 00:23:54.522
Where do you think you are? Red Lobster?
What are you doing?

452
00:23:54.542 --> 00:23:55.898
What do you think I got to do in there?

453
00:23:55.918 --> 00:23:57.358
Forget it.
Now, look, you haven't

454
00:23:57.378 --> 00:23:59.140
smoked pot for two whole days, right?

455
00:23:59.213 --> 00:24:01.904
Yes, I told you, I'm clean, all right?
Your baby's gonna be fine.

456
00:24:01.924 --> 00:24:03.760
I'm sorry, l just don't want something

457
00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:06.262
I got to feed with
a pitchfork when he's 16.

458
00:24:06.554 --> 00:24:07.764
"John Bennett.

459
00:24:07.847 --> 00:24:08.848
Hi.

460
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:11.789
Right this way, I'll show you where to
deposit your specimen.

461
00:24:12.226 --> 00:24:13.936
Hey, Johnny, Johnny.

462
00:24:23.863 --> 00:24:25.365
I'm John Bennett.

463
00:24:25.615 --> 00:24:27.533
I know, I just said your name.

464
00:24:27.617 --> 00:24:30.203
Oh, right, yeah, sorry,
I'm just a little nervous.

465
00:24:30.286 --> 00:24:32.413
I've been out of the game for a while.

466
00:24:32.622 --> 00:24:33.664
The game?

467
00:24:33.748 --> 00:24:37.835
I don't talk to pretty girls that often.
Pretty women, ladies.

468
00:24:38.461 --> 00:24:39.661
I see.

469
00:24:40.463 --> 00:24:42.463
Hey, when I'm done here,
how about a drink?

470
00:24:43.466 --> 00:24:46.803
Oh, I don't
mean this, I meant, like, a regular drink.

471
00:24:46.969 --> 00:24:48.471
I have a boyfriend.

472
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.725
Oh, yeah, okay, yeah, too bad,
You're missing out on a great guy.

473
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.895
Um, do I just spit in my hand or do I get

474
00:24:55.978 --> 00:24:58.106
a lube or something?
A magazine?

475
00:24:58.356 --> 00:25:00.088
Video? I like Asian
teen stuff preferably.

476
00:25:00.108 --> 00:25:01.067
There's lube right there.

477
00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.902
All right, yeah, thanks.

478
00:25:08.199 --> 00:25:11.077
Uh, excuse me. Where's your
non-jerk-off bathroom?

479
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.637
Down that hallway, to the left.

480
00:25:12.662 --> 00:25:14.038
Okay, thanks.

481
00:25:20.461 --> 00:25:21.921
Oh, No way!

482
00:25:23.131 --> 00:25:26.592
Oh, hey, Doc, is this where you guys
store all the, uh, stuff?

483
00:25:27.468 --> 00:25:30.430
It's the intermediary station
before insemination.

484
00:25:30.513 --> 00:25:31.639
Are you submitting?

485
00:25:31.722 --> 00:25:34.934
No, My friend is, uh, yanking out a sample
in one of the rooms.

486
00:25:35.643 --> 00:25:36.874
Oh, well, that's a good friend.
Yeah.

487
00:25:36.894 --> 00:25:37.937
I'm Dr. Danzer.

488
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.105
Oh, cool,

489
00:25:39.188 --> 00:25:42.900
Hold me closer, Dr. Danzer

490
00:25:42.984 --> 00:25:44.068
Yeah, whatever, I don't know.

491
00:25:44.152 --> 00:25:47.947
Now, wait, You look familiar,
Are you that teddy bear who came alive?

492
00:25:48.114 --> 00:25:49.449
I am, that's me, yeah.

493
00:25:49.532 --> 00:25:50.575
See, I was trying to figure out

494
00:25:50.658 --> 00:25:52.014
where I'd seen you before and that's it.

495
00:25:52.034 --> 00:25:53.119
Good eye, good eye.

496
00:25:53.202 --> 00:25:56.622
So, how did you get into this line of work?
Do you just love cum?

497
00:25:57.123 --> 00:25:58.124
Uh, uh...

498
00:25:58.207 --> 00:26:00.398
Not especially, but I
love helping good people

499
00:26:00.418 --> 00:26:02.275
fulfill their dreams of having children.

500
00:26:02.295 --> 00:26:04.422
It's amazing what we can do here.

501
00:26:04.881 --> 00:26:06.549
You want to have a look?

502
00:26:06.716 --> 00:26:08.176
Yeah, sure.

503
00:26:09.927 --> 00:26:13.723
This is where we perform
our pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.

504
00:26:13.806 --> 00:26:15.766
We can eliminate hereditary diseases,

505
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.020
such as cystic fibrosis, muscular
dystrophy, sickle-cell anemia.

506
00:26:19.145 --> 00:26:20.813
The list goes on and on, really.

507
00:26:20.897 --> 00:26:22.097
Wow.

508
00:26:22.482 --> 00:26:24.150
Hey, Johnny! You did it!

509
00:26:24.233 --> 00:26:25.234
Right here, buddy.

510
00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:27.069
Ew, I mean, awesome!

511
00:26:27.612 --> 00:26:29.510
Excuse me, Doctor, your wife's on the phone.

512
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.823
She said it's an emergency.

513
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.950
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

514
00:26:34.702 --> 00:26:36.913
You wanna see it? Huh?
You wanna see your kid?

515
00:26:37.079 --> 00:26:38.436
I can see it from here, thanks, yeah.

516
00:26:38.456 --> 00:26:39.896
Dude, take a closer look.
It's your kid.

517
00:26:39.916 --> 00:26:40.917
No, no, no!
Come on!

518
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.899
You got to take a closer look.
That's close enough, Johnny!

519
00:26:42.919 --> 00:26:44.817
He's beautiful, Come on!
I'll trade you, Catch.

520
00:26:44.837 --> 00:26:46.547
Oh, shit!
Oh, God!

521
00:26:46.714 --> 00:26:48.382
Fuck! Dude,
that's somebody's kid!

522
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:50.907
Well, it's not my fault, A-Rod! You were
supposed to catch it!

523
00:26:50.927 --> 00:26:51.969
We got to find something to scoop it up.

524
00:26:52.053 --> 00:26:53.701
There's containers over there.
Scoop it up with that.

525
00:26:53.721 --> 00:26:55.056
Shit, All right.

526
00:26:55.473 --> 00:26:56.516
No, no, that's not gonna work.

527
00:26:56.599 --> 00:26:58.748
You need two of them, you got to scoop
one into the other.

528
00:26:58.768 --> 00:27:00.353
Oh, shit! Fuck!

529
00:27:01.604 --> 00:27:02.897
Oh!
Oh, fuck!

530
00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:03.981
Oh, my God!

531
00:27:04.065 --> 00:27:05.066
Fuck! Fuck!

532
00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:07.318
Oh, my God!
It's in my eyes!

533
00:27:07.443 --> 00:27:08.444
I'm blinking it in!

534
00:27:08.528 --> 00:27:09.814
You got to fucking help me!

535
00:27:09.862 --> 00:27:11.552
Oh, my God!
It's in my fucking mouth!

536
00:27:11.572 --> 00:27:13.304
Hang on. I got to
post this on Facebook.

537
00:27:13.324 --> 00:27:14.524
No!

538
00:27:14.867 --> 00:27:17.286
Hashtag "Grr, Mondays.

539
00:27:17.453 --> 00:27:19.330
Oh, my God!

540
00:27:19.455 --> 00:27:21.437
Look, I'm so sorry! We swear to God,
it was an accident.

541
00:27:21.457 --> 00:27:22.657
We're so sorry.

542
00:27:22.917 --> 00:27:26.420
Well, I guess it's all right.
Those are the rejected sickle-cell samples.

543
00:27:26.587 --> 00:27:27.964
Ah, you hear that, Johnny?

544
00:27:28.089 --> 00:27:30.071
You're covered in
rejected black-guy sperm.

545
00:27:30.091 --> 00:27:31.384
You look like a Kardashian.

546
00:27:31.592 --> 00:27:32.802
Fuck!

547
00:27:45.147 --> 00:27:47.275
No, make sure you have all the updated

548
00:27:47.358 --> 00:27:49.090
information on our Comic Con placement.

549
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:52.405
This has to be the biggest,
most impressive rollout at the convention.

550
00:27:52.488 --> 00:27:53.688
Morning, Mr. Jessup.

551
00:27:54.323 --> 00:27:55.825
Good morning, Now...

552
00:27:55.908 --> 00:27:57.410
My name's Donny.

553
00:27:57.535 --> 00:27:59.787
Hi, Donny.

554
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.632
Now this is a multi-platform release,

555
00:28:01.664 --> 00:28:02.937
so I want a full report on all...

556
00:28:02.957 --> 00:28:04.166
Fresh cakes.

557
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.253
What?

558
00:28:07.336 --> 00:28:08.754
In the urinals, sir.

559
00:28:09.338 --> 00:28:11.340
I noticed you always use urinal four,

560
00:28:11.424 --> 00:28:13.234
so I put fresh cakes in there for you.

561
00:28:13.301 --> 00:28:16.304
You're an important man.
You should never have to smell pee.

562
00:28:17.013 --> 00:28:19.849
See, most people flip the cakes.

563
00:28:20.433 --> 00:28:22.101
I replace the cakes.

564
00:28:23.019 --> 00:28:25.146
That's the Donny difference.

565
00:28:27.315 --> 00:28:30.173
I need a full report on all the placement
of our merchandise.

566
00:28:30.234 --> 00:28:32.445
Contact Bob Jennings at Javas

567
00:28:34.488 --> 00:28:36.032
I'm afraid I have bad news.

568
00:28:36.407 --> 00:28:39.160
I won't be able to perform
the implantation procedure.

569
00:28:39.327 --> 00:28:41.037
- Wait, what?
- Why not?

570
00:28:41.203 --> 00:28:45.207
Tami-Lynn, according to your test results,
you're no longer fertile.

571
00:28:45.374 --> 00:28:46.375
What?

572
00:28:46.459 --> 00:28:48.377
Wait, Doc, are you sure about that?

573
00:28:48.544 --> 00:28:50.818
I mean, maybe you should check again
or something, you know?

574
00:28:50.838 --> 00:28:52.048
I'm quite sure.

575
00:28:52.214 --> 00:28:55.259
Tami-Lynn, because of your history
of excessive drug use

576
00:28:55.926 --> 00:28:59.305
your ovarian canal
has been somewhat compromised.

577
00:28:59.472 --> 00:29:01.711
What are you talking about?
It looks fine, Yeah.

578
00:29:02.391 --> 00:29:04.685
Forgive me, that's a normal ovary.

579
00:29:04.769 --> 00:29:06.312
This is Tami-Lynn's.

580
00:29:06.479 --> 00:29:07.679
Jesus!

581
00:29:07.772 --> 00:29:10.024
Yeah, but I bet this stuff happens a lot.

582
00:29:10.107 --> 00:29:12.506
You probably see this kind of stuff
all the time, right?

583
00:29:12.526 --> 00:29:14.779
No, not once, not ever.

584
00:29:14.945 --> 00:29:18.157
When I saw this, I threw up.
Almost quit medicine.

585
00:29:18.407 --> 00:29:21.160
Bottom line is,
insemination is not possible.

586
00:29:21.702 --> 00:29:24.830
I don't understand,
okay? None of this makes any sense.

587
00:29:24.914 --> 00:29:26.937
It's okay, It's okay, honey.
Come on, let's just go.

588
00:29:26.957 --> 00:29:28.434
No, what does this mean, Teddy?

589
00:29:28.459 --> 00:29:29.732
Does it mean we can't have a baby?

590
00:29:29.752 --> 00:29:31.317
I don't know.
But it's gonna be okay.

591
00:29:31.337 --> 00:29:32.838
Everything's gonna be okay.

592
00:29:33.005 --> 00:29:34.256
It really isn't.

593
00:29:46.727 --> 00:29:48.979
Well, I have gone
through your application

594
00:29:49.063 --> 00:29:51.273
and vetted your personal histories,

595
00:29:52.441 --> 00:29:54.394
and I'm afraid this isn't gonna work out.

596
00:29:55.444 --> 00:29:56.644
What?

597
00:29:56.696 --> 00:29:57.780
Why not?

598
00:29:57.863 --> 00:29:59.470
Well, first of all, there's the question

599
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.158
of Tami-Lynn's drug conviction.

600
00:30:01.325 --> 00:30:03.077
Hey, I did my community service.

601
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.788
Yeah, besides, that was five years ago.
She's clean.

602
00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.832
There's another issue,

603
00:30:07.915 --> 00:30:10.960
and, honesty, it's the more serious one.

604
00:30:11.043 --> 00:30:13.295
I was reluctant to bring it up because

605
00:30:14.588 --> 00:30:16.090
it's a little awkward.

606
00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:20.928
Ted, in the eyes of the state,
you are not a person.

607
00:30:22.138 --> 00:30:23.723
Wait, what?

608
00:30:24.807 --> 00:30:27.017
The state official I spoke to said

609
00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:30.229
that technically, you are
classified as property.

610
00:30:32.398 --> 00:30:34.817
I'm not a person?

611
00:30:35.234 --> 00:30:38.070
Not according to
the government, I'm sorry.

612
00:30:38.154 --> 00:30:39.864
But that is so fucked up!

613
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.800
Property?

614
00:30:41.991 --> 00:30:44.039
You know what, Teddy?
Let's get out of here.

615
00:30:44.243 --> 00:30:45.443
Come on.

616
00:30:46.871 --> 00:30:48.071
Look.

617
00:30:48.164 --> 00:30:49.957
You seem like good people.

618
00:30:50.124 --> 00:30:51.375
Be careful.

619
00:30:51.542 --> 00:30:53.544
What do you mean, "Be careful?

620
00:30:53.627 --> 00:30:55.588
The state official I spoke to

621
00:30:55.671 --> 00:30:59.300
made it sound like your status had
gone under the radar for some time.

622
00:30:59.842 --> 00:31:02.511
Your adoption request
may have raised some red flags.

623
00:31:03.095 --> 00:31:05.848
If they choose to investigate the issue,

624
00:31:06.015 --> 00:31:08.559
it may leave you quite vulnerable.

625
00:31:21.697 --> 00:31:24.158
Hey, I just got off work
and heard your message.

626
00:31:24.241 --> 00:31:25.931
Is that for real? Did they actually
tell you that?

627
00:31:25.951 --> 00:31:27.661
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
"Property.

628
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.455
They said I'm property.

629
00:31:29.705 --> 00:31:31.687
What does that even mean?
Like, you're a thing?

630
00:31:31.707 --> 00:31:33.542
What, like garbage or a piece of shit?

631
00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:37.463
I mean, maybe more like a hammer
or an orange, but yeah.

632
00:31:37.546 --> 00:31:38.819
What the hell do they know?

633
00:31:38.839 --> 00:31:39.882
It's just a word.

634
00:31:39.965 --> 00:31:42.406
They can't change your whole life just by
calling you property!

635
00:31:42.426 --> 00:31:45.346
Bullshit!
You better ask my ancestors.

636
00:31:45.554 --> 00:31:47.890
One minute, you in Africa,
washing your clothes

637
00:31:47.973 --> 00:31:49.892
in the river, titties out, you good.

638
00:31:50.059 --> 00:31:51.769
Then all of a sudden, you somewhere

639
00:31:51.852 --> 00:31:53.852
across the world,
fucking Thomas Jefferson.

640
00:31:53.896 --> 00:31:56.232
Wow! You make
history come alive.

641
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.345
Why the hell is this just coming up now?

642
00:31:58.567 --> 00:32:00.569
I mean, I've never voted.

643
00:32:00.736 --> 00:32:03.322
I don't have a driver's license,
I don't pay taxes.

644
00:32:03.405 --> 00:32:05.596
I mean, hell, this is
the first job I ever had.

645
00:32:06.951 --> 00:32:09.411
Ted, can I see you for a moment?

646
00:32:10.955 --> 00:32:12.081
I'm sorry,

647
00:32:12.164 --> 00:32:13.736
but I'm gonna have to let you go.

648
00:32:13.916 --> 00:32:17.586
What? Why? I've been
busting my ass at this job for three years!

649
00:32:17.837 --> 00:32:20.089
I just got a call from
the Labor Department.

650
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.050
I can't legally keep
you on as an employee

651
00:32:23.133 --> 00:32:25.407
because I've been informed
that you're technically...

652
00:32:25.427 --> 00:32:28.639
Technically not a person.
Yeah, Jesus Christ!

653
00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:32.977
I'm sorry, But as of today, you're fired.

654
00:32:36.397 --> 00:32:38.440
"Dear Ted, your Chase bank account

655
00:32:38.524 --> 00:32:40.858
"has been terminated due to
a lack of citizenship.

656
00:32:41.068 --> 00:32:43.612
"Dear Ted, your Discover card
has been revoked.

657
00:32:43.696 --> 00:32:46.615
"Dear Ted, you are no longer
a Papa Gino's rewards member.

658
00:32:46.824 --> 00:32:48.117
Fuck, that's a big one.

659
00:32:48.284 --> 00:32:50.244
This poor baby bootie.

660
00:32:50.786 --> 00:32:54.790
It's always gonna be empty. There's
never gonna be a little foot in here.

661
00:32:54.957 --> 00:32:58.210
I don't understand, We would have made
such great parents.

662
00:32:59.378 --> 00:33:00.588
Oh, my God.

663
00:33:00.963 --> 00:33:02.381
Oh, my God, Teddy!

664
00:33:02.464 --> 00:33:03.424
What? What's wrong?

665
00:33:03.507 --> 00:33:04.800
Look at this.

666
00:33:04.967 --> 00:33:06.176
"Dear Ted,

667
00:33:06.468 --> 00:33:09.138
"the state of Massachusetts
regrets to inform you

668
00:33:09.221 --> 00:33:12.266
"that due to an oversight
regarding your legal status

669
00:33:12.808 --> 00:33:17.354
your marriage to Tami-Lynn McCafferty
is unrecognized by the state

670
00:33:17.438 --> 00:33:20.357
"and, therefore, invalid
and hereby annulled.

671
00:33:20.733 --> 00:33:22.526
Teddy, can they do this to us?

672
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:23.810
Let me see that.

673
00:33:27.489 --> 00:33:29.158
This is a nightmare.

674
00:33:32.328 --> 00:33:33.662
You fucking believe that?

675
00:33:33.829 --> 00:33:35.831
No, This is insane.

676
00:33:35.998 --> 00:33:37.791
I mean, Tami's the woman I love.

677
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.190
You know, I never would even have
tried to adopt a dog

678
00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.484
if I had known it was gonna cause me
this kind of shit storm.

679
00:33:42.504 --> 00:33:44.314
This whole thing is complete bullshit.

680
00:33:44.381 --> 00:33:46.383
I mean, if you ask me,
we got to fight it.

681
00:33:46.926 --> 00:33:48.886
What do you mean?
I mean, we get a lawyer.

682
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.763
Oh, my God, Can we do that?

683
00:33:50.888 --> 00:33:52.286
Hell yeah!
You know what we do?

684
00:33:52.306 --> 00:33:53.579
We'll get a lawyer and we'll sue

685
00:33:53.599 --> 00:33:55.289
the fucking government
for your civil rights!

686
00:33:55.309 --> 00:33:57.144
Johnny, that's a great idea!

687
00:33:57.311 --> 00:33:59.501
Hey, hey! Maybe we get one of them
Harrison Ford lawyers

688
00:33:59.521 --> 00:34:02.004
who gets shot in the head, then
turns all retarded and nice and goes,

689
00:34:02.024 --> 00:34:03.108
"What we're doing is wrong.

690
00:34:03.192 --> 00:34:05.382
Yes, You know what, we get out there
and we stick it to them good.

691
00:34:05.402 --> 00:34:07.509
We take that shit all the way up
to Judge Judy if we have to.

692
00:34:07.529 --> 00:34:08.572
Yeah.

693
00:34:08.656 --> 00:34:11.388
But we don't know any lawyers, All our
friends make sandwiches.

694
00:34:11.408 --> 00:34:13.702
Ah, Oh, we just Google "Boston lawyers.

695
00:34:15.162 --> 00:34:17.331
Jesus, Look at that black cock.

696
00:34:37.476 --> 00:34:38.676
Uh...

697
00:34:39.103 --> 00:34:42.189
This is a very complicated case
you have here.

698
00:34:42.272 --> 00:34:46.819
Most civil rights cases are, but
this one has some very obvious wrinkles.

699
00:34:47.111 --> 00:34:49.207
Well, everybody says
you're the best in town.

700
00:34:49.279 --> 00:34:52.908
Listen, your case is not gonna be cheap.

701
00:34:53.075 --> 00:34:55.077
What is your financial situation?

702
00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:58.330
Uh, all of our holdings are tied up
in the railroads.

703
00:34:58.414 --> 00:35:00.896
Yeah, Reading Railroad, 5&0 Railroad,
Pennsylvania Railroad.

704
00:35:00.916 --> 00:35:04.108
We're working on Short Line, Urn, I
own Atlantic Avenue and Marvin Gardens.

705
00:35:04.128 --> 00:35:05.693
And I own four houses on Baltic Ave.

706
00:35:05.713 --> 00:35:07.778
I was thinking about just tearing them down
and building a hotel.

707
00:35:07.798 --> 00:35:10.572
I won second prize in a beauty contest.
That's $50 right there.

708
00:35:10.592 --> 00:35:12.511
Are you guys just saying Monopoly stuff?

709
00:35:12.803 --> 00:35:14.243
Tell you what, I'm gonna go
drive around the blook,

710
00:35:14.263 --> 00:35:15.639
and I'll be back with $200.

711
00:35:15.764 --> 00:35:17.766
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

712
00:35:17.933 --> 00:35:20.019
My niece recently passed her bar exam

713
00:35:20.102 --> 00:35:23.230
and I've hired her on as a junior associate
here at the firm.

714
00:35:23.355 --> 00:35:25.691
I could assign her to
your case, pro bono.

715
00:35:25.816 --> 00:35:27.673
And then you would get
a hungry, young attorney

716
00:35:27.693 --> 00:35:30.946
and I would get a more
experienced lawyer in return.

717
00:35:31.238 --> 00:35:32.524
So what do you say to that?

718
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.783
Yeah, sure, sounds great.

719
00:35:35.284 --> 00:35:37.578
Um, are those hard candies,
like, just to take?

720
00:35:38.495 --> 00:35:40.372
Uh, those aren't supposed to be out.

721
00:35:51.133 --> 00:35:52.134
Hello?

722
00:35:52.301 --> 00:35:54.386
Oh! Fuck!

723
00:35:55.137 --> 00:35:56.138
Hi.

724
00:35:56.221 --> 00:35:57.222
You Okay?

725
00:35:57.306 --> 00:35:58.891
Yeah! I'm fine.

726
00:35:58.974 --> 00:36:00.225
You must be Ted.

727
00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:02.227
Yeah, Uh, I'm Ted,

728
00:36:02.311 --> 00:36:03.740
- this is my buddy, John.
- Hi.

729
00:36:03.812 --> 00:36:07.316
Um, my uncle says that you guys
are my first clients.

730
00:36:07.649 --> 00:36:10.611
Uh, it's been discussed,

731
00:36:11.111 --> 00:36:12.926
but do you mind if I ask how old you are?

732
00:36:12.946 --> 00:36:14.448
I'm 26.

733
00:36:14.656 --> 00:36:15.856
Ah.

734
00:36:15.908 --> 00:36:17.367
What, is there a problem?

735
00:36:17.451 --> 00:36:19.475
Well, you know, I just don't want
my lawyer singing

736
00:36:19.495 --> 00:36:21.310
Frozen songs during
the opening arguments.

737
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.145
It's just this is
a really important case.

738
00:36:23.165 --> 00:36:25.606
Ted has already lost his job, his marriage
has been annulled.

739
00:36:25.626 --> 00:36:27.878
I know, My uncle gave me all the details.

740
00:36:28.045 --> 00:36:30.235
Right, You see, the thing is, we don't
want to take any chances

741
00:36:30.255 --> 00:36:32.216
because the stakes are so significant.

742
00:36:32.341 --> 00:36:33.572
We can't just rush into anything.

743
00:36:33.592 --> 00:36:35.074
We got to make sure we're making
the right decision.

744
00:36:35.094 --> 00:36:36.492
We really appreciate your time,

745
00:36:36.512 --> 00:36:37.785
but I think what
we're probably gonna do is

746
00:36:37.805 --> 00:36:39.377
just take a seat and get to work.

747
00:36:39.431 --> 00:36:40.432
Trust you completely.

748
00:36:40.516 --> 00:36:42.802
Yeah, we really feel like
you got a lot to offer.

749
00:36:44.311 --> 00:36:45.312
Sorry.

750
00:36:45.395 --> 00:36:46.668
You don't mind the pot, do you?

751
00:36:46.688 --> 00:36:47.731
I get migraines.

752
00:36:47.815 --> 00:36:49.338
Oh, absolutely, me, too.
That's fine.

753
00:36:49.358 --> 00:36:52.132
I'm gonna get a huge migraine
in the parking lot in about 20 minutes.

754
00:36:52.152 --> 00:36:53.904
Oh, I'm Samantha Jackson.

755
00:36:54.071 --> 00:36:55.572
Ted, How are ya?

756
00:36:55.739 --> 00:36:57.513
Good to meet you, John.
Nice to meet you.

757
00:36:57.533 --> 00:36:59.486
Wait, wait, wait.
What's your middle name?

758
00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.860
Leslie.

759
00:37:00.911 --> 00:37:03.956
Oh, my God! So you're Sam L. Jackson!

760
00:37:04.039 --> 00:37:06.021
That's fucking great!
Just like Sam L. Jackson!

761
00:37:06.041 --> 00:37:07.084
Who is that?

762
00:37:07.209 --> 00:37:10.212
You ever seen any movie ever?
He's the black guy.

763
00:37:13.048 --> 00:37:14.508
That weed is really good.

764
00:37:14.591 --> 00:37:16.031
It reminds me of the strain I smoked

765
00:37:16.051 --> 00:37:17.861
last summer called "Here Comes Autism.

766
00:37:17.886 --> 00:37:20.369
Yeah, I was just gonna say it's sort of like
this other batch we had called

767
00:37:20.389 --> 00:37:22.015
"How Long Has That Van Been There?

768
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:25.602
No, it's this new strain my dealer
gave me called Help Me Get Home.

769
00:37:25.727 --> 00:37:27.918
You know, I'm surprised a lawyer
like you gets high.

770
00:37:27.938 --> 00:37:29.378
I mean, aren't you
supposed to be fighting

771
00:37:29.398 --> 00:37:31.065
the War on Drugs and all that shit?

772
00:37:31.108 --> 00:37:33.068
Please, the War on Drugs is a joke.

773
00:37:33.193 --> 00:37:34.550
It's just a way for the government

774
00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:36.051
to inflate law enforcement budgets

775
00:37:36.071 --> 00:37:38.699
and lock up minorities
for no good legal reason.

776
00:37:38.782 --> 00:37:41.368
And you, my friend,
are an oppressed minority.

777
00:37:41.535 --> 00:37:43.120
Yeah, No shit.

778
00:37:43.203 --> 00:37:45.477
They've denied you the same rights
as everybody else

779
00:37:45.497 --> 00:37:46.854
just because you're different,

780
00:37:46.874 --> 00:37:49.501
and I say that's a violation
of the Constitution.

781
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.199
So what do you say?
Can you get me my life back?

782
00:37:55.799 --> 00:37:57.217
I'm gonna try.

783
00:37:57.551 --> 00:37:59.011
Hey, guys?

784
00:37:59.094 --> 00:38:01.180
I'm having some trouble over here.

785
00:38:01.471 --> 00:38:02.671
What's the matter?

786
00:38:03.891 --> 00:38:05.309
Can you help me get home?

787
00:38:06.226 --> 00:38:08.353
I'm having a really hard time here, guys.

788
00:38:08.437 --> 00:38:10.127
Johnny, it's okay, buddy, It's okay.

789
00:38:10.147 --> 00:38:11.378
You're doing fine.
You're doing great.

790
00:38:11.398 --> 00:38:12.357
No, I'm scared, All right.

791
00:38:12.441 --> 00:38:14.318
I know, Come on, it's okay, though.

792
00:38:14.401 --> 00:38:16.116
You just have to hang onto the wall.

793
00:38:17.362 --> 00:38:18.780
Don't let the goose get me!

794
00:38:19.281 --> 00:38:20.616
How far away does he live?

795
00:38:21.116 --> 00:38:22.450
Uh, about a mile-and-a-half.

796
00:38:22.492 --> 00:38:23.535
Fuck, okay.

797
00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:26.496
Hey, it's okay, One foot in front
of the other.

798
00:38:36.131 --> 00:38:39.509
All right, I got Dred Scott Vs Sandford,
Plessy Vs Ferguson

799
00:38:39.593 --> 00:38:41.386
and Brown Vs the Board of Education.

800
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:45.807
I got Kramer Vs. Kramer, Alien Vs. Predator,
and Freddy Vs. Jason.

801
00:38:45.891 --> 00:38:49.186
I got, uh, Ernest Goes to Camp,
Ernest Goes to Jail

802
00:38:49.269 --> 00:38:52.522
and The Importance of Being Earnest,
which was very disappointing.

803
00:39:14.086 --> 00:39:15.984
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
a few test questions, Are you ready?

804
00:39:16.004 --> 00:39:17.089
Yep, bring it on.

805
00:39:17.172 --> 00:39:18.799
You're on the stand, the DA says,

806
00:39:18.882 --> 00:39:21.051
"Ted, do you consider yourself
to be human?

807
00:39:21.134 --> 00:39:22.261
- Objection!
- Sustained!

808
00:39:22.344 --> 00:39:23.345
No, the witness can't object.

809
00:39:23.428 --> 00:39:24.429
- Overruled!
- Sidebar?

810
00:39:24.513 --> 00:39:25.472
- Guilty!
- Speculation!

811
00:39:25.555 --> 00:39:27.120
- Hearsay! Briefcase!
- Bailiff! Disregard!

812
00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.747
- In my chambers!
- Stop beavering the witness!

813
00:39:28.767 --> 00:39:30.123
- I rest,
- We could totally be lawyers.

814
00:39:30.143 --> 00:39:31.343
Bang.

815
00:40:56.271 --> 00:40:58.857
Oh, my God! I'm gonna
fall off the building.

816
00:41:04.446 --> 00:41:06.615
Your name is Toby!

817
00:41:06.698 --> 00:41:08.617
You're going to learn to say your name.

818
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.327
Let me hear you say it.

819
00:41:11.161 --> 00:41:12.454
What's your name?

820
00:41:13.747 --> 00:41:16.291
Kunta, Kunta Kinte.

821
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.961
That's just like me, That's exactly what
I'm going through.

822
00:41:20.045 --> 00:41:21.474
Well, it's a little different.

823
00:41:21.797 --> 00:41:25.509
You know, Ted, if you legally become a
person, you're gonna need a last name.

824
00:41:25.967 --> 00:41:28.970
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Okay, okay, I got one.

825
00:41:29.137 --> 00:41:30.337
Okay, what is it?

826
00:41:30.472 --> 00:41:31.973
Clubber Lang.

827
00:41:32.307 --> 00:41:33.725
Who is Clubber Lang?

828
00:41:33.809 --> 00:41:34.935
Who's Clubber Lang?

829
00:41:35.018 --> 00:41:37.020
Mr. T's character
in Rocky Ill. Hello?

830
00:41:37.479 --> 00:41:39.064
Is that the boxing movies?

831
00:41:39.314 --> 00:41:40.273
The boxing...

832
00:41:40.357 --> 00:41:42.130
- You've never seen Rocky?
- She's not serious.

833
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.276
You've never seen Rocky?

834
00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.560
You know...

835
00:41:48.281 --> 00:41:49.324
You know, Rocky!

836
00:41:49.408 --> 00:41:51.139
I'm not gonna remember
a movie I've never seen

837
00:41:51.159 --> 00:41:52.974
just because you're singing a song
I don't know.

838
00:41:52.994 --> 00:41:55.566
You don't know Samuel L. Jackson,
you don't know Rocky.

839
00:41:55.622 --> 00:41:57.479
You are literally pop culture illiterate.

840
00:41:57.499 --> 00:41:58.917
I have a college degree.

841
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.483
My pop culture references are Hamlet,
Achilles and Dorian Gray.

842
00:42:01.503 --> 00:42:02.587
Ever heard of any of them?

843
00:42:02.671 --> 00:42:05.132
No, but I'm pretty sure
Mr. T could kick their ass!

844
00:42:05.215 --> 00:42:07.175
Yeah, Sam, you really
need to be educated.

845
00:42:07.342 --> 00:42:11.680
Oh, really? Um, can either of you
tell me who wrote The Great Gatsby?

846
00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.306
- Judy Blume?
- Hitler?

847
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:14.599
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

848
00:42:14.683 --> 00:42:15.883
Who's that?

849
00:42:16.017 --> 00:42:17.018
The author.

850
00:42:17.185 --> 00:42:18.614
Why are you saying, "Fuck him?

851
00:42:18.687 --> 00:42:19.646
What?

852
00:42:19.729 --> 00:42:21.169
You just said "F"
Scott Fitzgerald."

853
00:42:21.189 --> 00:42:22.963
- What did Scott Fitzgerald do to you?
- Yeah.

854
00:42:22.983 --> 00:42:24.693
No, that's his first name.

855
00:42:24.985 --> 00:42:26.653
His name's Fuck Scott Fitzgerald?

856
00:42:26.736 --> 00:42:27.936
What? No.

857
00:42:27.988 --> 00:42:29.344
Well, then, what's the "F" stand for?

858
00:42:29.364 --> 00:42:30.365
Francis.

859
00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:32.055
- No, It's got to be "Fuck.
- It must be "Fuck.

860
00:42:32.075 --> 00:42:33.473
- It's got to be "Fuck.
- It has to be "Fuck.

861
00:42:33.493 --> 00:42:34.724
Why the hell would it be "Fuck?

862
00:42:34.744 --> 00:42:36.476
Well, because otherwise,
why wouldn't he just say it?

863
00:42:36.496 --> 00:42:37.894
Yeah, he's hiding something, It's "Fuck.

864
00:42:37.914 --> 00:42:39.855
- Come on, read between the lines, Sam
- It's Fuck.

865
00:42:39.875 --> 00:42:42.043
That's completely
insane, you guys are idiots.

866
00:42:42.127 --> 00:42:45.213
Yeah, well, whatever.
Ted Clubber Lang, Get used to it.

867
00:42:50.969 --> 00:42:52.169
Yes!

868
00:42:53.889 --> 00:42:55.089
Sir?

869
00:42:55.223 --> 00:42:58.101
Um, one of the janitors
would like to see you.

870
00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.760
I'm busy.

871
00:43:00.061 --> 00:43:01.688
Fresh cakes!

872
00:43:02.522 --> 00:43:03.722
What is it, Danny?

873
00:43:03.773 --> 00:43:04.983
Uh, Donny, sir.

874
00:43:05.066 --> 00:43:08.487
Well, Donny, I'm extremely
busy with the Comic Con presentation...

875
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:11.011
I'm told that you have an open-door policy
here at Hasbro

876
00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:13.575
for new toy ideas
from any and all employees?

877
00:43:14.576 --> 00:43:16.369
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

878
00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:18.914
All right, come in.

879
00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.540
Okay.

880
00:43:20.707 --> 00:43:23.251
Thank you, Thank you.
I love your dress.

881
00:43:29.382 --> 00:43:30.592
Mr. Jessup,

882
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.220
I can make this company
a billion dollars.

883
00:43:33.595 --> 00:43:34.795
I'm listening.

884
00:43:35.889 --> 00:43:36.932
Thirty years ago,

885
00:43:37.098 --> 00:43:39.392
a little boy named
John Bennett made a wish

886
00:43:39.476 --> 00:43:41.728
that his teddy bear would come to life.

887
00:43:41.895 --> 00:43:44.147
Somehow, one of our Hasbro bears...

888
00:43:44.231 --> 00:43:45.941
Yes, I'm aware of the story.

889
00:43:47.776 --> 00:43:49.486
Have you seen this?

890
00:43:54.658 --> 00:43:55.742
So what?

891
00:43:55.825 --> 00:43:58.995
Well, Ted is suing for his civil rights.

892
00:43:59.162 --> 00:44:02.040
If he loses, the state
will officially declare him

893
00:44:02.123 --> 00:44:04.751
a non-entity with
no rights under the law.

894
00:44:05.293 --> 00:44:07.420
That means he becomes property.

895
00:44:07.879 --> 00:44:09.079
Mr. Jessup,

896
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:14.302
we could take him back, with only
a trivial degree of legal consequence

897
00:44:14.386 --> 00:44:15.929
if we were even caught.

898
00:44:16.137 --> 00:44:17.722
And why would we do this?

899
00:44:17.806 --> 00:44:22.811
Sir, if we could cut him open to see
what makes him tick,

900
00:44:22.978 --> 00:44:27.107
we could manufacture millions of Teds for
every child in the world.

901
00:44:27.232 --> 00:44:29.818
Hasbro would double
its profits overnight.

902
00:44:30.902 --> 00:44:31.945
Go on.

903
00:44:32.028 --> 00:44:34.823
We just have to make sure
Ted loses the case.

904
00:44:35.031 --> 00:44:38.076
You use every back channel, every bribe,

905
00:44:38.201 --> 00:44:39.452
you call in every favor

906
00:44:39.536 --> 00:44:43.832
and you get the best lawyer in the world
on the defense.

907
00:44:44.332 --> 00:44:47.377
When Ted's rights are officially null,

908
00:44:48.837 --> 00:44:50.297
we grab him.

909
00:44:51.715 --> 00:44:54.801
No one's going to kick up a legal fuss
over property.

910
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:58.722
You're a hell of a lot smarter than
your urinal cakes, Danny.

911
00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.380
Really?

912
00:45:00.515 --> 00:45:02.851
Now, what exactly do you want from this?

913
00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.313
Mr. Jessup, I'm not interested
in money.

914
00:45:08.732 --> 00:45:11.067
I just want a Ted for my very own.

915
00:45:12.235 --> 00:45:15.363
All right, I think I can
handle the defense.

916
00:45:16.364 --> 00:45:17.949
But let's make one thing clear.

917
00:45:18.033 --> 00:45:19.701
We never had this conversation.

918
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:23.371
Goldner and the board
cannot know about this until we have him.

919
00:45:23.913 --> 00:45:25.290
Do you understand?

920
00:45:25.373 --> 00:45:26.708
Yes, I do.

921
00:45:30.253 --> 00:45:32.255
I need Shep Wild.

922
00:45:35.091 --> 00:45:37.677
That was such a good dinner, Tami-Lynn.

923
00:45:37.802 --> 00:45:39.701
I've never had Pringles on
my steak before.

924
00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:40.921
Oh, it's my pleasure.

925
00:45:40.972 --> 00:45:44.351
It's the least I can do
with all you're doing for us, Really.

926
00:45:44.434 --> 00:45:46.686
Oh, I haven't done anything yet.

927
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:48.543
Well, you know, we wanted to take
you out to dinner,

928
00:45:48.563 --> 00:45:52.567
but, uh, all we got is Tami's income
these days since nobody will hire me.

929
00:45:52.651 --> 00:45:54.215
Things are getting really tight, huh?

930
00:45:54.235 --> 00:45:56.613
Yeah, I've had to do
some things I'm not proud of.

931
00:45:56.905 --> 00:46:00.283
BJs here! Get your BJs!
Get your red-hot BJs!

932
00:46:00.367 --> 00:46:03.161
Toothless and ready to go.
Just 3 dollar! 3 dollar!

933
00:46:03.244 --> 00:46:04.579
Get your BJs here.

934
00:46:04.996 --> 00:46:06.122
Wow.

935
00:46:06.206 --> 00:46:07.492
Hey, listen, l got an idea.

936
00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:10.085
Uh, Tami, what do
you say you and me go do the dishes

937
00:46:10.168 --> 00:46:12.712
and give Sam and Diane here
some alone time, eh'?

938
00:46:13.046 --> 00:46:15.256
All right, all right.

939
00:46:15.548 --> 00:46:17.967
Hey, you go pull a bad back, bitch!

940
00:46:19.594 --> 00:46:21.166
What do you think that was about?

941
00:46:21.304 --> 00:46:23.411
Oh, it's nothing, That's his way of saying
I should ask you out.

942
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:24.474
Ah.

943
00:46:24.557 --> 00:46:25.642
Uh, yeah, look...

944
00:46:25.725 --> 00:46:28.416
We should probably focus our attention
on the case for now.

945
00:46:28.436 --> 00:46:30.063
I completely agree.

946
00:46:31.106 --> 00:46:35.193
You know, l am a little bit curious, How
is it that a guy like you is unattached?

947
00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:40.782
Well, I was married at one point,
but it just didn't work out.

948
00:46:40.949 --> 00:46:43.118
Shits, I'm sorry, That sucks.

949
00:46:43.284 --> 00:46:46.746
No, I mean, we'd make it work day to day,

950
00:46:47.205 --> 00:46:48.895
but she was always
just trying to change me

951
00:46:48.915 --> 00:46:50.125
into someone I'm not.

952
00:46:50.291 --> 00:46:52.001
And I tried, you know?

953
00:46:52.836 --> 00:46:56.297
I really tried everything
I could to be the man that she wanted.

954
00:46:56.798 --> 00:47:00.385
One day I woke up and I just realized
I wasn't myself anymore.

955
00:47:01.219 --> 00:47:05.306
You know, as much as I love this person,
we're completely wrong for each other.

956
00:47:06.057 --> 00:47:08.226
At least you figured it out early.

957
00:47:08.518 --> 00:47:10.125
Some people go through their whole lives

958
00:47:10.145 --> 00:47:12.241
trying to make it work
with the wrong person.

959
00:47:12.564 --> 00:47:13.815
Yeah.

960
00:47:15.108 --> 00:47:16.585
So, we're gonna win this thing?

961
00:47:16.985 --> 00:47:18.862
Honestly, I don't know.

962
00:47:19.237 --> 00:47:20.739
Oh, we're betting on you.

963
00:47:21.531 --> 00:47:24.013
Hey, Johnny, come on, It's almost 7:00.
We got to get up there.

964
00:47:24.033 --> 00:47:25.390
Hey, Sam, you want in on this?

965
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.453
What is it?

966
00:47:26.536 --> 00:47:29.539
On Tuesday nights, we get fucked up
and throw apples at joggers.

967
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:34.910
Oh, there's one!

968
00:47:36.421 --> 00:47:37.861
- How's your workout?
- Fuck you!

969
00:47:37.881 --> 00:47:39.758
Eat my pussy!
Have some apples!

970
00:47:39.841 --> 00:47:41.603
Jesus, what the hell is your problem?

971
00:47:41.843 --> 00:47:44.053
It's everybody else's fault, Mary Decker!

972
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:45.555
Barn!

973
00:47:45.638 --> 00:47:47.807
You sons of bitches!
What the fuck is your...

974
00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.188
That's the lottery!
That's the lottery!

975
00:47:53.271 --> 00:47:55.899
That's what you get
for fucking exercising!

976
00:47:56.357 --> 00:47:58.109
That is unbelievable!

977
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.760
Teddy.

978
00:48:34.729 --> 00:48:36.147
Teddy, I'm scared.

979
00:48:36.231 --> 00:48:37.482
Baby, we're gonna be fine.

980
00:48:37.565 --> 00:48:40.777
I don't care what any fucking
piece of paper says, You're my wife.

981
00:48:41.152 --> 00:48:42.904
I love you so much.

982
00:48:42.987 --> 00:48:44.302
And I swear to God, if we lose,

983
00:48:44.322 --> 00:48:45.907
I'm gonna fucking cut that judge.

984
00:48:46.074 --> 00:48:47.680
Wait a minute.
You brought your switchblade?

985
00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:48.701
Yeah.

986
00:48:48.785 --> 00:48:51.226
But they patted us down on the way in here.
Where'd you even hide it?

987
00:48:51.246 --> 00:48:52.664
Oh!

988
00:48:53.915 --> 00:48:55.115
Hey, Sam.

989
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.335
Who's that buttnut over there?

990
00:48:59.796 --> 00:49:02.924
That is why we've been working so hard.
That's Shep Wild.

991
00:49:03.007 --> 00:49:05.055
It's our bad luck
they put him on the trial.

992
00:49:05.426 --> 00:49:07.220
He's never lost a case in his life.

993
00:49:07.846 --> 00:49:11.558
Mr. Wild, your opening statement,
if you please.

994
00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:13.226
Thank you, Your Honor.

995
00:49:14.143 --> 00:49:17.143
I would first like to thank
the ladies and gentlemen of the jury

996
00:49:17.313 --> 00:49:20.108
for taking time out
of their busy schedules

997
00:49:20.525 --> 00:49:22.360
to be a part of these proceedings.

998
00:49:22.819 --> 00:49:28.032
Now, the case we'll be examining today
is really quite a simple one.

999
00:49:28.408 --> 00:49:30.660
Is Ted a human being?

1000
00:49:31.119 --> 00:49:32.704
Or a piece of property?

1001
00:49:33.538 --> 00:49:39.335
You know, it really is a very special,
very unique thing to be human.

1002
00:49:40.044 --> 00:49:43.923
It's a gift from God bestowed upon
only one species.

1003
00:49:44.382 --> 00:49:45.582
Us.

1004
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.845
But if we suddenly decide
to share that gift,

1005
00:49:49.846 --> 00:49:51.306
where does that lead us?

1006
00:49:51.973 --> 00:49:53.975
Does your dog deserve human rights?

1007
00:49:54.475 --> 00:49:55.768
Your cat?

1008
00:49:55.852 --> 00:49:57.270
Your toaster?

1009
00:50:00.481 --> 00:50:03.693
Suddenly, being human
doesn't seem so special anymore, does it?

1010
00:50:04.861 --> 00:50:07.572
I'm confident you'll make
the right decision.

1011
00:50:08.615 --> 00:50:11.367
Thank you, Mr. Wild,
for your opening statement.

1012
00:50:11.743 --> 00:50:12.952
Ms. Jackson?

1013
00:50:18.875 --> 00:50:20.084
Hi.

1014
00:50:21.002 --> 00:50:22.879
I am Samantha Jackson.

1015
00:50:23.338 --> 00:50:25.548
I got to be honest with you, I'm...

1016
00:50:26.341 --> 00:50:28.259
I'm a little nervous.

1017
00:50:28.718 --> 00:50:30.386
Why am I nervous? Um...

1018
00:50:31.471 --> 00:50:35.016
Well, not because I'm a junior attorney
arguing her first case.

1019
00:50:35.683 --> 00:50:37.332
And not because some of you might laugh

1020
00:50:37.352 --> 00:50:40.063
at the fact that
I'm representing a teddy bear.

1021
00:50:42.857 --> 00:50:47.153
No, I'm... I'm nervous because
of one simple word.

1022
00:50:49.614 --> 00:50:50.865
"Justice.

1023
00:50:51.783 --> 00:50:56.454
I'm nervous that you're going
to be swayed

1024
00:50:56.621 --> 00:50:59.624
by smooth talk and a haircut,

1025
00:50:59.874 --> 00:51:04.003
and forget about the most important
aspect of this case.

1026
00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:06.580
Justice.

1027
00:51:08.299 --> 00:51:09.680
A hundred and fifty years ago

1028
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:12.136
a slave by the name of Dred Scott

1029
00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.807
sued to prove that he was a person and
not a piece of property.

1030
00:51:16.265 --> 00:51:17.725
He lost.

1031
00:51:17.976 --> 00:51:21.980
And as history has shown us,
that wasn't justice.

1032
00:51:24.273 --> 00:51:26.943
In every civil rights conflict,

1033
00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:31.656
we are only able to recognize
the just point of view

1034
00:51:31.739 --> 00:51:33.574
years after the fact.

1035
00:51:34.075 --> 00:51:36.244
And when the next conflict comes along,

1036
00:51:36.411 --> 00:51:39.414
we're once again blind to it
as it's happening.

1037
00:51:40.415 --> 00:51:43.835
"Well, this is different,"
we say, but it isn't.

1038
00:51:45.003 --> 00:51:48.172
It is the same beast, just wearing
a different face,

1039
00:51:48.256 --> 00:51:49.882
and it's happening again today.

1040
00:51:51.426 --> 00:51:54.637
So I urge you, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1041
00:51:54.804 --> 00:51:57.932
not to be a footnote
on the wrong side of history.

1042
00:52:00.601 --> 00:52:02.770
Don't wait too long to be right.

1043
00:52:04.439 --> 00:52:05.639
Thank you.

1044
00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:10.611
Erection.

1045
00:52:10.778 --> 00:52:12.321
Sustained.

1046
00:52:14.949 --> 00:52:18.016
Ms. Mc.Cafferty, you and Ted recently
considered adopting a child.

1047
00:52:18.036 --> 00:52:19.236
Is that correct?

1048
00:52:19.454 --> 00:52:20.654
Yeah.

1049
00:52:20.913 --> 00:52:22.206
And if I may inquire,

1050
00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:24.671
why did you not choose to have
a child of your own?

1051
00:52:25.251 --> 00:52:26.775
Because Teddy ain't got no dick.

1052
00:52:30.506 --> 00:52:31.549
Uh-huh.

1053
00:52:31.632 --> 00:52:36.345
And, uh, why does Ted not possess a, uh,
male appendage?

1054
00:52:36.804 --> 00:52:38.181
Is it a freak of genetics?

1055
00:52:38.473 --> 00:52:40.955
No, asshole, he ain't got a dick
because he's a fucking toy!

1056
00:52:40.975 --> 00:52:42.018
What's your excuse?

1057
00:52:42.143 --> 00:52:43.770
Whoa-ho! Take a burn!

1058
00:52:43.853 --> 00:52:46.377
Yeah! How's your tongue
taste in your own ass, Poindexter?

1059
00:52:46.397 --> 00:52:47.607
Yeah! How'd you...
What?

1060
00:52:47.732 --> 00:52:49.442
Order!

1061
00:52:50.651 --> 00:52:51.851
Mr. Bennett,

1062
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.490
how would you categorize
your relationship with Ted?

1063
00:52:56.407 --> 00:52:57.658
He's my best friend.

1064
00:52:58.076 --> 00:53:00.161
So you don't see him as your property.

1065
00:53:00.495 --> 00:53:03.122
No, he's not my property.
He's a person.

1066
00:53:03.206 --> 00:53:05.271
He's way more of a person
than lots of other people.

1067
00:53:05.291 --> 00:53:06.672
I mean, fucking Steven Tyler?

1068
00:53:06.751 --> 00:53:08.066
What the fuck is that?
Some kind of

1069
00:53:08.086 --> 00:53:09.734
weird soccer-mom-looking Goonie monster?

1070
00:53:09.754 --> 00:53:11.255
- Your Honor?
- I'll allow it.

1071
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:13.049
Thank you, Your Honor.

1072
00:53:13.716 --> 00:53:15.176
Your witness.

1073
00:53:18.679 --> 00:53:19.889
Mr. Bennett,

1074
00:53:20.765 --> 00:53:23.017
when and where did
you first encounter Ted?

1075
00:53:23.518 --> 00:53:25.958
Oh, what do you mean? My parents got him
for me when I was a kid.

1076
00:53:25.978 --> 00:53:28.064
A-ha, they got him.

1077
00:53:29.607 --> 00:53:31.025
Where did they get him?

1078
00:53:33.861 --> 00:53:35.113
Child World toy store.

1079
00:53:35.196 --> 00:53:37.178
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that.
Could you repeat that, please?

1080
00:53:37.198 --> 00:53:38.888
Child World toy store.
You fucking heard me.

1081
00:53:38.908 --> 00:53:40.348
There's no need for hostility,
Mr. Bennett.

1082
00:53:40.368 --> 00:53:41.661
Why? Nobody here likes you!

1083
00:53:41.744 --> 00:53:43.840
I saw you eating lunch alone!
You're a loser!

1084
00:53:43.871 --> 00:53:44.956
- Your Honor?
- Mr. Bennett.

1085
00:53:45.039 --> 00:53:46.468
I hope your kids get bird flu!

1086
00:53:46.541 --> 00:53:47.542
Mr. Bennett!

1087
00:53:47.625 --> 00:53:48.825
I'm sorry.

1088
00:53:48.876 --> 00:53:51.921
Now, you said your parents purchased Ted,

1089
00:53:52.088 --> 00:53:55.383
as one might purchase
a baseball glove or a Big Wheel.

1090
00:53:55.466 --> 00:53:56.666
No, it's not like that!

1091
00:53:56.717 --> 00:53:57.718
Objection!

1092
00:53:57.802 --> 00:53:59.011
You can't do that!

1093
00:53:59.095 --> 00:54:00.368
You know what?
This is bullshit!

1094
00:54:00.388 --> 00:54:02.140
This court is trying to tell me

1095
00:54:02.223 --> 00:54:03.704
that I'm not as good as other people,

1096
00:54:03.724 --> 00:54:05.957
and this is exactly what you've been
doing to the fags!

1097
00:54:05.977 --> 00:54:06.978
Ted!

1098
00:54:07.061 --> 00:54:08.020
Sorry, sorry.
The homos, the homos.

1099
00:54:08.104 --> 00:54:09.710
This is exactly what you've been doing

1100
00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:11.295
to the homos, and I say it's wrong!

1101
00:54:11.315 --> 00:54:13.901
Ms. Jackson,
please control your client

1102
00:54:13.985 --> 00:54:16.128
or I'll hold both of you
in contempt of court!

1103
00:54:16.154 --> 00:54:17.238
Oh, piss off!

1104
00:54:17.321 --> 00:54:20.036
I'm standing up for rne and I'm standing up
for the homos!

1105
00:54:20.074 --> 00:54:21.159
We deserve respect!

1106
00:54:21.242 --> 00:54:22.243
Ted, shut up!

1107
00:54:22.368 --> 00:54:23.619
Fine.

1108
00:54:32.879 --> 00:54:35.403
Your Honor, I'd like to call
Ted Clubber Lang to the stand.

1109
00:54:35.423 --> 00:54:36.623
Yes!

1110
00:54:36.716 --> 00:54:38.676
My turn, assholes!

1111
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:45.090
Ted,

1112
00:54:45.683 --> 00:54:46.893
do you love your wife?

1113
00:54:46.976 --> 00:54:50.104
Objection, She's not his wife.
The marriage was annulled.

1114
00:54:50.313 --> 00:54:51.772
I'll rephrase.

1115
00:54:52.899 --> 00:54:54.358
Do you love Tami-Lynn?

1116
00:54:54.775 --> 00:54:57.862
I love my wife, Okay?
My wife.

1117
00:54:57.945 --> 00:54:59.427
More than anything in the world.

1118
00:54:59.447 --> 00:55:01.657
We're married, I don't care
what anybody says.

1119
00:55:02.074 --> 00:55:05.620
So you're saying you are capable
of feeling love.

1120
00:55:05.995 --> 00:55:07.195
Yeah.

1121
00:55:07.496 --> 00:55:09.163
Hey, it must be weird for you guys,

1122
00:55:09.207 --> 00:55:10.646
having a doll up here on the stand

1123
00:55:10.666 --> 00:55:13.333
with no kid pointing to where his uncle
touched him, huh?

1124
00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:15.370
Yeah, no, yeah, no.

1125
00:55:15.421 --> 00:55:18.382
Yeah, lam capable.
I love a lot of stuff, Yeah.

1126
00:55:18.966 --> 00:55:23.095
Ted, do you believe you have a soul?

1127
00:55:24.472 --> 00:55:26.849
What did you think

1128
00:55:27.266 --> 00:55:29.852
I would do at this moment

1129
00:55:30.311 --> 00:55:33.147
When you're standing before me

1130
00:55:33.231 --> 00:55:35.942
With tears in your eyes

1131
00:55:36.734 --> 00:55:38.069
That answer your question?

1132
00:55:38.152 --> 00:55:39.612
Objection, Your Honor?

1133
00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.572
Overruled!

1134
00:55:41.739 --> 00:55:44.867
A-ha! What it is, man!
Dynomite.

1135
00:55:45.159 --> 00:55:46.994
Ted, Right, right.
Sorry, sorry.

1136
00:55:48.162 --> 00:55:51.207
Look, I'm not a scientist, okay?

1137
00:55:51.832 --> 00:55:55.169
I don't know exactly what
makes a person a person.

1138
00:55:55.336 --> 00:55:57.797
All I know is I feel stuff.

1139
00:55:58.297 --> 00:55:59.674
Just like all you guys.

1140
00:56:00.758 --> 00:56:03.282
And I don't think I ought to be treated
any different.

1141
00:56:07.181 --> 00:56:08.683
Capable of love.

1142
00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:11.894
Aware of his own consciousness.

1143
00:56:14.689 --> 00:56:16.399
Seems pretty human to me.

1144
00:56:17.358 --> 00:56:19.277
No further questions.

1145
00:56:19.986 --> 00:56:21.186
Mr. Kidder,

1146
00:56:21.279 --> 00:56:25.533
you were an employee at Hasbro from 1976
to 1998. Is that correct?

1147
00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.619
Yes, I supervised the stuffing of
the teddy bears.

1148
00:56:29.078 --> 00:56:30.685
And what is that stuffing made of?

1149
00:56:30.705 --> 00:56:33.124
A synthetic cotton-poly blend.

1150
00:56:33.291 --> 00:56:34.959
Is there anything else in there?

1151
00:56:35.293 --> 00:56:39.213
The bear products are affixed
with an electronic device in the chest

1152
00:56:39.547 --> 00:56:42.675
which can be programmed
to say any one of five phrases.

1153
00:56:44.218 --> 00:56:45.418
Hmm.

1154
00:56:48.306 --> 00:56:49.506
Ted,

1155
00:56:50.391 --> 00:56:52.143
would you please press your chest?

1156
00:56:54.353 --> 00:56:55.553
What?

1157
00:56:55.855 --> 00:56:58.566
Please follow the instruction,
Mr. Clubber Lang.

1158
00:57:03.738 --> 00:57:05.239
I love you!

1159
00:57:15.624 --> 00:57:17.001
No further questions.

1160
00:57:19.754 --> 00:57:21.589
Also in the news, a pending court case

1161
00:57:21.714 --> 00:57:23.758
is beginning to get national attention

1162
00:57:23.841 --> 00:57:25.801
for its civil rights ramifications.

1163
00:57:25.926 --> 00:57:27.867
Ted, the bear,
who some of you may remember

1164
00:57:27.887 --> 00:57:31.390
came to life back in the mid-'80s
right here in Boston,

1165
00:57:31.557 --> 00:57:34.560
is suing to prove he is indeed a person.

1166
00:57:34.852 --> 00:57:37.355
Okay, so what are we even talking
about here?

1167
00:57:37.438 --> 00:57:41.317
What we're talking about is a civil
rights issue, This bear has rights.

1168
00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.361
Oh, come on! He does not!
He's a toy.

1169
00:57:43.444 --> 00:57:45.009
Then why are you calling it a "he"?

1170
00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:47.365
Look, we call the Statue of Liberty "she,

1171
00:57:47.448 --> 00:57:50.785
but we all know it's an object made
of copper and steel.

1172
00:57:50.868 --> 00:57:51.911
Oh, good point.

1173
00:57:51.952 --> 00:57:55.373
Yes, but she isn't conscious
or sentient, He is, Mmm-hmm.

1174
00:57:55.623 --> 00:57:56.665
Now, come on!

1175
00:57:56.749 --> 00:57:58.439
Are any of you
gonna sit there and tell me

1176
00:57:58.459 --> 00:58:00.169
that this stuffed doll is a person?

1177
00:58:00.252 --> 00:58:01.212
- No.
- Not at all.

1178
00:58:01.295 --> 00:58:02.526
We all agree all the time.

1179
00:58:02.546 --> 00:58:04.945
I don't think he should want to be
considered a person.

1180
00:58:04.965 --> 00:58:06.906
After all, you know, Ted spent many years

1181
00:58:06.926 --> 00:58:08.719
sleeping and cuddling with a child.

1182
00:58:08.803 --> 00:58:10.701
That's cute when you're a stuffed animal.

1183
00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:12.723
When you're a person, that's a felony.

1184
00:58:14.642 --> 00:58:17.603
Ted, do you have anything to say
in your own defense?

1185
00:58:17.978 --> 00:58:22.358
I am not an animal!

1186
00:58:25.903 --> 00:58:27.154
You see, your Honor?

1187
00:58:27.238 --> 00:58:28.572
He's not an animal.

1188
00:58:36.956 --> 00:58:39.500
I'm sorry, your Honor.
I'm on my period.

1189
00:58:40.167 --> 00:58:45.673
And live from New York, it's Saturday Night!

1190
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:05.109
What is taking them so long?

1191
00:59:05.192 --> 00:59:07.049
Oh, is it bad that
they're taking this long?

1192
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:08.696
It's not good or bad.
It just means

1193
00:59:08.779 --> 00:59:10.589
that they're probably having a debate.

1194
00:59:10.698 --> 00:59:13.079
Johnny, it may be time
to play the Betelgeuse card.

1195
00:59:13.159 --> 00:59:14.160
What do you mean?

1196
00:59:14.243 --> 00:59:15.891
I mean saying his name three times.

1197
00:59:15.911 --> 00:59:16.954
What?

1198
00:59:17.037 --> 00:59:18.269
Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse.

1199
00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:19.489
Shut up!

1200
00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:20.855
You fucking crazy?
We don't want

1201
00:59:20.875 --> 00:59:22.106
that guy running around in here.

1202
00:59:22.126 --> 00:59:23.357
No, Johnny, he'll be on our side.

1203
00:59:23.377 --> 00:59:24.775
He'll help us.
Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse...

1204
00:59:24.795 --> 00:59:27.381
You are meddling with powers
you do not understand.

1205
00:59:27.465 --> 00:59:28.665
Cut the shit.

1206
00:59:40.728 --> 00:59:41.928
Please be seated.

1207
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:47.485
Mr. Willer, has the jury
reached a verdict?

1208
00:59:47.735 --> 00:59:49.570
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1209
00:59:50.237 --> 00:59:54.325
Um, 'm the case of Ted v. The Commonwealth
of Massachusetts,

1210
00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:59.747
we, the jury, find for the Commonwealth
in that Ted is not a person.

1211
01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:13.251
Very well.

1212
01:00:13.302 --> 01:00:16.138
The plaintiff is hereby
legally deemed property.

1213
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.266
The definition entails
the rights there of

1214
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:21.810
and will be recognized in the terms set

1215
01:00:21.894 --> 01:00:24.271
by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1216
01:00:24.355 --> 01:00:27.441
The court wishes to thank the jury
for its service.

1217
01:00:34.615 --> 01:00:36.534
Are you sure you can get him?

1218
01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.619
Remember, you're on your own out there.

1219
01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:40.579
Hasbro can have no connection to this.

1220
01:00:40.746 --> 01:00:42.248
Oh, I'll get him.

1221
01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:45.326
And when I have him, I'll call you
with the code phrase.

1222
01:00:46.126 --> 01:00:47.753
Do you remember what it is?

1223
01:00:48.128 --> 01:00:49.338
Yes, I remember it.

1224
01:00:49.505 --> 01:00:50.819
Should we say it just for safety?

1225
01:00:50.839 --> 01:00:51.840
No, that's not necessary.

1226
01:00:51.924 --> 01:00:52.883
Say it, Just say it.
Say it.

1227
01:00:52.967 --> 01:00:54.240
I don't want to.
I don't have to.

1228
01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.460
Fresh cakes.

1229
01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.471
Fresh cakes.

1230
01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.898
This isn't fucking fair.

1231
01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:09.900
Teddy's a good man.

1232
01:01:10.317 --> 01:01:12.937
Why is he being treated differently
than everybody else?

1233
01:01:13.279 --> 01:01:15.489
It's what this country does best.

1234
01:01:15.573 --> 01:01:17.575
Putting different people
into little groups

1235
01:01:17.658 --> 01:01:19.098
and making them watch Tyler Perry.

1236
01:01:19.118 --> 01:01:20.327
It's wrong!

1237
01:01:21.704 --> 01:01:23.080
I'm so sorry, baby.

1238
01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:26.667
No, I'm sorry! I thought
I'd built a better case.

1239
01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:27.918
It's just...

1240
01:01:28.002 --> 01:01:30.254
The reality is you have
a really shitty lawyer.

1241
01:01:30.379 --> 01:01:31.422
Hey, come on.

1242
01:01:31.505 --> 01:01:34.280
Nobody's blaming you for this.
You did everything you could.

1243
01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.343
I... I'm sitting here

1244
01:01:36.427 --> 01:01:38.762
and I...
I can't believe it's official.

1245
01:01:39.221 --> 01:01:40.764
Oh, so what are we gonna do now?

1246
01:01:40.848 --> 01:01:44.087
I mean, we can't take this lying
down, right? We got to do something.

1247
01:01:44.476 --> 01:01:47.334
You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna
call Patrick Meighan.

1248
01:01:47.354 --> 01:01:48.554
Who's that?

1249
01:01:48.731 --> 01:01:51.400
He is the top civil rights attorney
in America.

1250
01:01:51.525 --> 01:01:54.008
Wait, Is he the one who got that female
midget into the Marines?

1251
01:01:54.028 --> 01:01:55.029
Yeah.

1252
01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:56.510
Yeah, that had a sad ending though,
you remember?

1253
01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:57.970
She was at a Veterans Day parade,

1254
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:59.305
and somebody handed her
a bunch of balloons

1255
01:01:59.325 --> 01:02:00.525
and...
Gone!

1256
01:02:00.701 --> 01:02:02.661
It was very sad.
Very sad for the family.

1257
01:02:02.828 --> 01:02:05.352
You know what? If anyone oan
get this verdict overturned, it's him.

1258
01:02:05.372 --> 01:02:06.457
He's not cheap,

1259
01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.626
but we've become such
a high profile case,

1260
01:02:08.709 --> 01:02:10.961
l feel like he might take it pro bono.

1261
01:02:11.045 --> 01:02:12.463
He's a sucker for media.

1262
01:02:16.258 --> 01:02:17.968
Hey, Johnny, how about a beer, huh?

1263
01:02:18.052 --> 01:02:19.553
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1264
01:02:20.721 --> 01:02:23.370
Hi, I'm calling for Patrick Meighan.
This is Samantha Jackson.

1265
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:26.727
I defended Ted Clubber Lang
in Ted Vs Massachusetts.

1266
01:02:27.645 --> 01:02:28.646
Hey!

1267
01:02:28.729 --> 01:02:32.775
Hi, Mr. Meighan. Thank you so much
for taking my call.

1268
01:02:34.568 --> 01:02:37.321
Oh, you've been following
the case, That's great.

1269
01:02:38.364 --> 01:02:40.240
Yeah, that's actually why I'm calling.

1270
01:02:40.324 --> 01:02:42.159
Yeah, I was wondering

1271
01:02:42.242 --> 01:02:46.580
if, um, maybe you would consider helping us
try to overturn the verdict.

1272
01:02:48.457 --> 01:02:52.419
Well, yeah, I mean, it would have to be
a pro bono situation

1273
01:02:52.503 --> 01:02:54.735
because we're not really working
with much money.

1274
01:02:54.755 --> 01:02:56.965
But I think you'll be impressed
with my client.

1275
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:58.842
Oh! Ha-ha!
Motherfucker!

1276
01:02:58.926 --> 01:03:00.177
Sure.

1277
01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:03.555
Yeah, great.
Okay, Thank you so much!

1278
01:03:03.639 --> 01:03:05.974
Okay, I'll see you then, bye.

1279
01:03:06.266 --> 01:03:07.466
Oh, my God!

1280
01:03:07.518 --> 01:03:09.458
He said he'll meet with us on Friday
at 9:00 a.m.

1281
01:03:09.478 --> 01:03:10.896
at his office in New York.

1282
01:03:10.979 --> 01:03:12.218
Is he gonna take the case?

1283
01:03:12.272 --> 01:03:14.316
I don't want to jinx it, but I think so.

1284
01:03:14.483 --> 01:03:16.610
Oh, my God! You hear that, Johnny?

1285
01:03:16.694 --> 01:03:17.966
- I still get a shot!
- Yes!

1286
01:03:17.986 --> 01:03:19.613
Oh, my God!
We got to celebrate!

1287
01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:20.864
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1288
01:03:20.948 --> 01:03:23.347
Let's go down to the improv
and yell sad suggestions?

1289
01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:24.368
Fuck yeah!

1290
01:03:24.451 --> 01:03:27.454
So first we need a historical event.
Who's got an event?

1291
01:03:27.621 --> 01:03:28.622
911.

1292
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:31.291
Okay, maybe something else.

1293
01:03:31.458 --> 01:03:33.107
All right, let's start with a person.

1294
01:03:33.127 --> 01:03:34.327
Robin Williams!

1295
01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:37.589
Okay, all right, for real, guys, for real.
Who's got a person?

1296
01:03:37.673 --> 01:03:39.550
Robin Williams on 911.

1297
01:03:39.633 --> 01:03:41.448
All right, we've heard from these guys.

1298
01:03:41.468 --> 01:03:44.221
Let's maybe give somebody else
over here a chance.

1299
01:03:44.304 --> 01:03:46.161
How about a location?
Let's go with a location.

1300
01:03:46.181 --> 01:03:48.142
The offices of Charlie Hebdo.

1301
01:03:48.434 --> 01:03:51.311
Okay, seriously, sir, uh,
I just need a location.

1302
01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:52.604
Ferguson, Missouri.

1303
01:03:52.688 --> 01:03:54.064
Germanwings cockpit.

1304
01:03:54.231 --> 01:03:56.255
- Okay, I heard "Starbucks.
- No, you didn't.

1305
01:03:56.275 --> 01:03:57.475
Nobody said Starbucks.

1306
01:03:57.526 --> 01:04:00.654
All right, Starbucks, Okay, now,
who's in the Starbucks?

1307
01:04:00.821 --> 01:04:02.021
Bill Cosby.

1308
01:04:02.156 --> 01:04:03.356
You people are monsters.

1309
01:04:03.574 --> 01:04:05.139
We're giving you the tools, buddy.

1310
01:04:05.159 --> 01:04:06.779
Come on, make some fucking comedy.

1311
01:04:18.005 --> 01:04:20.053
All right, We'll be back
tomorrow afternoon.

1312
01:04:20.215 --> 01:04:22.217
I love you so much, Teddy.

1313
01:04:22.384 --> 01:04:25.721
You go kick some ass because I
am not taking off this wedding ring.

1314
01:04:25.888 --> 01:04:29.016
I love you too, baby.
I'll see you soon.

1315
01:05:13.602 --> 01:05:15.604
If you wanna sit there with a pie of meat

1316
01:05:15.687 --> 01:05:17.898
Just fuck your own brother
in the front seat

1317
01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:20.776
Oh, why can't you just say please?

1318
01:05:20.859 --> 01:05:23.362
Hey! Must be the money

1319
01:05:24.071 --> 01:05:26.720
Hey, Sam, why do you have a duffel bag
that says Arizona State?

1320
01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.222
Because that's where I went to school.

1321
01:05:28.242 --> 01:05:30.285
What, you went to Arizona State?

1322
01:05:30.369 --> 01:05:31.370
Yeah, why?

1323
01:05:31.453 --> 01:05:33.497
Oh, man, that's why we lost the case.

1324
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:34.665
- Hello?
- You're dicks.

1325
01:05:34.748 --> 01:05:38.001
Arizona State. Hey, how many times you been
fucked on a houseboat?

1326
01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.255
Oh, come on.

1327
01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:42.569
Did you write your dissertation

1328
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:44.925
on the collected works of, uh, Red Bull?

1329
01:05:45.092 --> 01:05:47.094
Yeah, Yeah, I did, I got an A on it.

1330
01:05:47.344 --> 01:05:51.473
So do you say Arizona State University
or do you just say HPVU?

1331
01:05:56.311 --> 01:05:59.026
This is perfect, We're gonna get to
the city before 10:00.

1332
01:05:59.273 --> 01:06:01.066
Hey, Sam, how's your boring salad?

1333
01:06:01.149 --> 01:06:02.609
Mmm, it's actually delicious.

1334
01:06:02.776 --> 01:06:04.758
Everybody always says
that about their salad.

1335
01:06:04.778 --> 01:06:06.176
They're all a bunch of fucking liars.

1336
01:06:06.196 --> 01:06:08.073
No, I love it.
It's really good.

1337
01:06:08.156 --> 01:06:10.597
Have some Cookie Crisp, You need
something nutritional.

1338
01:06:10.617 --> 01:06:12.015
Why do you think I want your Cookie Crisp?

1339
01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:13.934
Because you've been staring at it,
and you want it.

1340
01:06:13.954 --> 01:06:16.954
Hey, what's the deal here?
You guys ever gonna make out or what?

1341
01:06:17.124 --> 01:06:18.375
Teddy, come on, dude!

1342
01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:21.712
No, I'm just saying, You look like you're
hitting it off, you know?

1343
01:06:21.962 --> 01:06:23.672
Sam, you dig him, right?

1344
01:06:25.674 --> 01:06:26.717
Hey!

1345
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.740
Where the hell's my coffee? I've been
waiting for 10 minutes.

1346
01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.076
I'm so sorry, sir, I forgot.
I'll get it right away.

1347
01:06:31.096 --> 01:06:34.335
Jesus, you're a waitress,
you're not building rockets, Figure it out!

1348
01:06:34.474 --> 01:06:35.893
What a prick!

1349
01:06:36.351 --> 01:06:39.113
Hey, 20 bucks I can toss a Cookie Crisp
into his ass crack.

1350
01:06:39.146 --> 01:06:40.346
Wait, let me try.

1351
01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.921
I used to pitch for the softball team
at Arizona State.

1352
01:06:42.941 --> 01:06:44.941
Oh, yeah? Was your mascot a broken condom?

1353
01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:46.403
Shut up.

1354
01:06:47.154 --> 01:06:48.906
- Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!

1355
01:06:48.989 --> 01:06:50.741
Who did that?

1356
01:06:50.991 --> 01:06:53.744
Oh, Jesus Christ.
You got to be kidding me!

1357
01:06:53.827 --> 01:06:55.637
Now, we're assholes.
Look what you did.

1358
01:06:55.662 --> 01:06:58.415
I swear to God, I'll kick your goddamn ass!
Who was it?

1359
01:06:58.498 --> 01:07:01.418
Uh, sir, I apologize
for my 5-year-old son.

1360
01:07:01.627 --> 01:07:02.878
I'm sowwy!

1361
01:07:03.003 --> 01:07:04.046
Sowwy, sir.

1362
01:07:04.171 --> 01:07:06.590
Cookie Crisp in your bum-bumzies, I'm sowwy.

1363
01:07:07.174 --> 01:07:10.510
Well, under the circumstances,
I guess it's okay.

1364
01:07:10.969 --> 01:07:13.096
Oh, my God, Now we're even
bigger assholes.

1365
01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.990
Go get my Cookie Crisp out of his ass.

1366
01:07:15.015 --> 01:07:16.371
You guys making trouble over here?

1367
01:07:16.391 --> 01:07:18.373
Uh, no, ma'am. We're just
minding our business.

1368
01:07:18.393 --> 01:07:21.108
Let's try to keep your boyfriend
under control here, yeah?

1369
01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:22.689
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

1370
01:07:23.106 --> 01:07:24.306
Oh.

1371
01:07:24.524 --> 01:07:25.734
Good.

1372
01:07:26.026 --> 01:07:27.507
We'll just get the check.
Thanks.

1373
01:07:27.527 --> 01:07:28.820
Of course.

1374
01:07:31.156 --> 01:07:32.157
Oh, my God.

1375
01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.431
John, did you see that? She was
totally giving you the fuck-me eyes.

1376
01:07:35.452 --> 01:07:36.453
No, she wasn't.

1377
01:07:36.536 --> 01:07:38.018
She was giving you the fuck-me eyes.

1378
01:07:38.038 --> 01:07:39.277
What are the fuck-me eyes?

1379
01:07:39.414 --> 01:07:41.917
Some women just have fuck-me eyes.

1380
01:07:42.376 --> 01:07:43.627
Do I have fuck-me eyes?

1381
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:46.129
No, you have "Give us the ring,
my precious" eyes.

1382
01:07:46.713 --> 01:07:47.714
We better get going.

1383
01:07:47.798 --> 01:07:49.863
We got two hours of driving left and
I'm kind of beat.

1384
01:07:49.883 --> 01:07:51.615
Yeah, we got to be
well rested for tomorrow.

1385
01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:53.553
I'll drive.
You can take a nap.

1386
01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:54.920
You don't have a license.

1387
01:07:54.972 --> 01:07:56.473
Who cares?
Johnny lets me drive

1388
01:07:56.556 --> 01:07:58.038
every once in a while
when he's too hammered.

1389
01:07:58.058 --> 01:07:59.258
I'm a fucking pro!

1390
01:07:59.685 --> 01:08:00.894
Besides,

1391
01:08:00.978 --> 01:08:03.480
I've been kicked around
a lot this week. I just...

1392
01:08:03.814 --> 01:08:05.649
I want to feel useful, you know?

1393
01:08:06.274 --> 01:08:07.547
Twenty minutes behind the wheel.

1394
01:08:07.567 --> 01:08:08.767
Yay!

1395
01:09:12.382 --> 01:09:13.967
Ah! Ah!
Shit, shit, shit!

1396
01:09:44.581 --> 01:09:45.832
What the fuck?

1397
01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:48.393
Well, Sam, it's been 20 minutes.
You wanna take over?

1398
01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:03.391
Hey, listen, Sam, I'm real sorry.

1399
01:10:03.475 --> 01:10:05.185
That barn just came out of nowhere.

1400
01:10:05.268 --> 01:10:07.604
No, no, it's my fault.
I... I, uh...

1401
01:10:07.687 --> 01:10:09.314
I should never have let you drive.

1402
01:10:09.397 --> 01:10:10.982
Yeah, You were wrong.

1403
01:10:11.066 --> 01:10:12.733
- You were wrong to do that.
- Yeah.

1404
01:10:12.776 --> 01:10:16.696
But that and the trial are the only
two things you fucked up, So, uh...

1405
01:10:17.531 --> 01:10:19.282
I can't see shit in there.

1406
01:10:19.366 --> 01:10:21.765
We're gonna have to wait till tomorrow
to get the car out.

1407
01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:24.371
Uh, wait, Are we gonna
spend the night here?

1408
01:10:24.538 --> 01:10:27.110
Yeah, it'll be fine, We just got to find
some firewood.

1409
01:10:38.051 --> 01:10:39.251
What the hell?

1410
01:10:45.142 --> 01:10:47.310
Holy shit! Hey, Ted!

1411
01:10:48.353 --> 01:10:51.565
You know what this is?
It's Super Lemon Haze.

1412
01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:52.774
It's a really rare strain.

1413
01:10:52.858 --> 01:10:55.382
It's a cross between Lemon Skunk and
Super Silver Haze.

1414
01:10:55.402 --> 01:10:56.444
It's totally potent.

1415
01:10:56.528 --> 01:10:57.884
I've only had it once in my life

1416
01:10:57.904 --> 01:10:59.594
and it was one of the best highs I ever had.

1417
01:10:59.614 --> 01:11:00.887
What the hell is a leaf of this stuff

1418
01:11:00.907 --> 01:11:02.384
doing out in the middle of a...

1419
01:11:31.438 --> 01:11:34.232
Dear God! Dear God in heaven!

1420
01:11:35.192 --> 01:11:36.776
So beautiful.

1421
01:11:38.028 --> 01:11:39.696
It's so beautiful.

1422
01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:41.823
No words.

1423
01:11:42.782 --> 01:11:45.035
No words.

1424
01:11:45.118 --> 01:11:47.120
They should've sent a poet.

1425
01:11:54.461 --> 01:11:56.296
They're moving in herds.

1426
01:11:57.214 --> 01:11:59.132
They do move in herds.

1427
01:12:03.261 --> 01:12:06.119
Please tell me that's not the only bong
you brought on this trip.

1428
01:12:06.139 --> 01:12:09.059
Yeah, Sam. This puts us in kind of
an awkward position, here.

1429
01:12:09.142 --> 01:12:10.619
I mean, we wanna get high, too.

1430
01:12:10.685 --> 01:12:12.125
I don't have any papers or nothing.

1431
01:12:12.145 --> 01:12:15.023
Is this hilarious? I got it at
a bachelorette party.

1432
01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:18.235
It's so stupid.
Here, try it.

1433
01:12:18.318 --> 01:12:19.402
Uh, no.

1434
01:12:19.486 --> 01:12:20.528
Why?

1435
01:12:20.612 --> 01:12:23.073
I don't wanna put
a big glass cock in my mouth.

1436
01:12:23.156 --> 01:12:24.532
Oh, you think this is big?

1437
01:12:25.825 --> 01:12:27.515
Johnny, you walked right into that one, pal.

1438
01:12:27.535 --> 01:12:28.495
This is all I brought.

1439
01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:30.477
How about this? I'm gonna go
check out the barn

1440
01:12:30.497 --> 01:12:32.562
and I'm gonna see
if I can find a soda can or something

1441
01:12:32.582 --> 01:12:33.813
for us to make an actual bong.

1442
01:12:33.833 --> 01:12:35.833
Yeah, see if you can make a non-dick bong.

1443
01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:38.634
Yeah. Hey, that's the name
of the South Korean president.

1444
01:12:38.672 --> 01:12:39.872
Right?

1445
01:12:40.006 --> 01:12:41.258
She gets... You get it.

1446
01:12:41.341 --> 01:12:42.342
Right? No.

1447
01:12:42.509 --> 01:12:43.551
What?

1448
01:12:43.718 --> 01:12:45.387
Okay, I'll be back.

1449
01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:47.222
Sorry.

1450
01:12:47.389 --> 01:12:49.891
No, This is nice.

1451
01:12:50.058 --> 01:12:51.893
You know? I always wanted my ex-wife

1452
01:12:51.977 --> 01:12:53.750
to get stoned with me. She never would.

1453
01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:54.771
Really?

1454
01:12:54.854 --> 01:12:57.774
Wow, That's the cornerstone
of any great marriage.

1455
01:12:57.941 --> 01:12:59.359
I agree.

1456
01:13:03.363 --> 01:13:05.907
So, you think this Meighan
guy is gonna help us?

1457
01:13:06.074 --> 01:13:08.910
I mean, honestly, I don't know. Um...

1458
01:13:10.287 --> 01:13:11.954
But we're going to the right place.

1459
01:13:12.956 --> 01:13:14.604
Listen, I just really want to thank you

1460
01:13:14.624 --> 01:13:16.523
for all you've clone,
all you're doing for us.

1461
01:13:16.543 --> 01:13:18.336
I know it's not making you rich.

1462
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:19.462
Please.

1463
01:13:19.546 --> 01:13:21.927
There are more important things
in life than money.

1464
01:13:23.216 --> 01:13:24.426
Look,

1465
01:13:25.135 --> 01:13:27.345
I don't know what kind of mojo was in

1466
01:13:27.429 --> 01:13:29.202
that wish you made when you were a child,

1467
01:13:29.222 --> 01:13:31.099
but this bear is alive.

1468
01:13:32.058 --> 01:13:36.104
And it seems to me that once the law
devalues one kind of life,

1469
01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:38.898
how soon before it devalues another?

1470
01:13:39.232 --> 01:13:41.151
Who gets subjugated after the bear?

1471
01:13:42.777 --> 01:13:44.779
You're really smart, you know that?

1472
01:13:46.156 --> 01:13:47.585
How come you don't have a guy?

1473
01:13:47.741 --> 01:13:49.993
Dude, have you seen the guys in Boston?

1474
01:13:50.076 --> 01:13:52.124
I'm supposed to date some pale, blotchy guy

1475
01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:54.144
with a wife-beater under his Bruins jacket

1476
01:13:54.164 --> 01:13:56.583
and a shamrock tattoo on his calf? Nope.

1477
01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:57.709
Yeah.

1478
01:13:57.792 --> 01:13:59.085
That's so dumb.

1479
01:14:00.086 --> 01:14:01.588
I couldn't find any cans,

1480
01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:04.404
but I got to tell you,
there's some awesome shit in that barn.

1481
01:14:04.424 --> 01:14:07.567
Take a look at this, I found a cowboy hat
and a rifle and a guitar.

1482
01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:09.154
Hey, be careful with that, huh.

1483
01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:10.697
No, it's okay. It's not loaded.

1484
01:14:12.307 --> 01:14:14.476
And my fucking nose came off.

1485
01:14:15.977 --> 01:14:17.937
Jeez, I wonder who this place belongs to.

1486
01:14:18.063 --> 01:14:20.023
Maybe we should find someplace else.

1487
01:14:20.106 --> 01:14:22.108
We're in the middle of nowhere.

1488
01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:24.859
If we get out of here by
dawn, we should be fine, right?

1489
01:14:26.488 --> 01:14:27.739
You play the guitar?

1490
01:14:28.615 --> 01:14:31.117
A little bit. I learned when I was a kid.

1491
01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:43.463
Mean moon

1492
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:45.965
It must be fun

1493
01:14:47.384 --> 01:14:52.514
To shine upon me as I come undone

1494
01:14:53.139 --> 01:14:58.978
Till I'm all alone beneath the sun

1495
01:14:59.479 --> 01:15:05.652
You mean on moon

1496
01:15:06.111 --> 01:15:11.574
With your beam you led the way

1497
01:15:12.992 --> 01:15:18.498
And found me love
I thought was here to stay

1498
01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:25.088
Then you went and took my love away

1499
01:15:25.171 --> 01:15:30.343
You mean on moon

1500
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:37.350
Oh, you mean on stars above

1501
01:15:37.892 --> 01:15:43.982
The games thatyou play with me

1502
01:15:44.482 --> 01:15:49.446
I could find some happiness

1503
01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:56.536
If all of my nights were cloudy

1504
01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:59.747
Mean on moon

1505
01:16:00.248 --> 01:16:02.709
I hope it's true

1506
01:16:04.169 --> 01:16:09.215
You're takin' all the
light that's left in you

1507
01:16:09.883 --> 01:16:16.139
And saving it up for you know who

1508
01:16:16.222 --> 01:16:22.145
You mean on moon

1509
01:16:22.562 --> 01:16:29.235
You mean on moon

1510
01:16:47.754 --> 01:16:49.422
Yes!

1511
01:17:05.188 --> 01:17:06.388
You got it.

1512
01:17:06.606 --> 01:17:07.806
You got it!

1513
01:17:07.941 --> 01:17:09.442
Come on, put your legs into it.

1514
01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:13.488
There you go! Nice job!

1515
01:17:13.571 --> 01:17:14.572
Jesus.

1516
01:17:14.656 --> 01:17:16.074
So, listen, I got to ask.

1517
01:17:16.157 --> 01:17:19.285
Was it just kissing last night?
Or was there finger stuff?

1518
01:17:25.458 --> 01:17:27.982
Man, we got a lot of pot in this car.
I wish we could smoke it.

1519
01:17:28.002 --> 01:17:29.317
Oh, we're gonna smoke it, all right,

1520
01:17:29.337 --> 01:17:30.610
but just stuff it under the seat for now.

1521
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:31.631
We don't wanna go to jail.

1522
01:17:31.714 --> 01:17:32.966
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1523
01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:52.298
Oh, what the fuck? What are you doing?

1524
01:17:52.318 --> 01:17:55.321
Hashtag "My amazing summer.

1525
01:17:55.613 --> 01:17:57.470
God damn it! What the hell's wrong with you?

1526
01:17:57.490 --> 01:17:58.888
Oh, I fucking owe you, you bastard.

1527
01:17:58.908 --> 01:18:00.223
What do you mean? I was just messing around.

1528
01:18:00.243 --> 01:18:02.203
Oh, shut up and suck that dick.

1529
01:18:02.287 --> 01:18:03.487
Oh, fuck you.

1530
01:18:31.232 --> 01:18:32.692
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1531
01:18:32.734 --> 01:18:34.591
Watch it, Jesus! Watch where you're going!

1532
01:18:34.611 --> 01:18:37.530
It's a crosswalk, jackass! We have the right of way!
- Yeah.

1533
01:18:37.614 --> 01:18:38.615
Whoa!

1534
01:18:38.698 --> 01:18:41.097
Hey, what the hell you doing
walking around dressed like Star Wars?

1535
01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:44.162
It's Comic Con, you idiot!
We're going to the Javits Center.

1536
01:18:44.245 --> 01:18:45.685
You're the idiots, because you three guys

1537
01:18:45.705 --> 01:18:47.020
would never be walking together!

1538
01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.959
Yeah, you're his boss and
you two guys are enemies!

1539
01:18:50.043 --> 01:18:51.669
Yeah, bite me, Captain Kirk!

1540
01:18:51.753 --> 01:18:53.568
- Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.
- Hey! Come on, That's Star Trek!

1541
01:18:53.588 --> 01:18:54.944
Yeah, that's two different franchises.

1542
01:18:54.964 --> 01:18:56.571
Yeah, sorry, guys. She doesn't know.

1543
01:18:56.591 --> 01:18:59.115
Nah, it's okay, I'm sorry
you have to deal with that.

1544
01:18:59.844 --> 01:19:01.387
All right, let's go.

1545
01:19:02.639 --> 01:19:04.370
Oh, hey, come on. It's not worth it, man.

1546
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:05.975
Come on.

1547
01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.788
This Patrick Meighan's
got a classy setup, huh?

1548
01:19:26.871 --> 01:19:28.071
Mmm.

1549
01:19:32.627 --> 01:19:35.254
And there is our first impression.

1550
01:19:35.755 --> 01:19:37.757
Ms. Jackson? Mr. Meighan will see you now.

1551
01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.425
Oh, okay, thank you.

1552
01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.518
Ah, Ms. Jackson, Do come in.

1553
01:19:49.102 --> 01:19:50.937
Mr. Meighan, this is such an honor.

1554
01:19:51.104 --> 01:19:52.752
Thank you so much for meeting with us.

1555
01:19:52.772 --> 01:19:55.024
Not at all, It's my
pleasure. Please, sit down.

1556
01:19:55.233 --> 01:19:57.360
Oh, this office is fucking awesome.

1557
01:19:57.443 --> 01:19:59.362
Yeah, totally. Hey, hey.

1558
01:19:59.612 --> 01:20:01.041
You ever bring chicks up here?

1559
01:20:01.781 --> 01:20:02.981
What do you think?

1560
01:20:03.199 --> 01:20:06.285
I think I want to sleep on
a bed made of your voice.

1561
01:20:07.954 --> 01:20:09.414
I'll get right down to it.

1562
01:20:09.706 --> 01:20:11.802
I don't want to waste too much of your time.

1563
01:20:13.292 --> 01:20:16.129
Ted, I've been reviewing your file.

1564
01:20:16.421 --> 01:20:18.715
And while I'm sympathetic to your cause,

1565
01:20:18.798 --> 01:20:22.009
I'm sorry to say I won't
be taking your case.

1566
01:20:22.135 --> 01:20:23.219
- What?
- Why?

1567
01:20:23.302 --> 01:20:24.303
Why not?

1568
01:20:24.429 --> 01:20:26.222
Well, it comes down to this.

1569
01:20:28.307 --> 01:20:31.102
You want to be human in the eyes of the law.

1570
01:20:31.436 --> 01:20:33.813
That's a hard sell, even for me.

1571
01:20:34.313 --> 01:20:36.733
See, the important thing about being human

1572
01:20:36.816 --> 01:20:39.193
is making a contribution to society.

1573
01:20:39.277 --> 01:20:41.654
Assisting in the betterment of your race.

1574
01:20:42.029 --> 01:20:43.823
You've done none of that.

1575
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:45.616
I've read about your life.

1576
01:20:45.783 --> 01:20:48.953
The drugs, the parties,
the prostitutes, the arrests.

1577
01:20:49.036 --> 01:20:51.456
Mr. Meighan, we've come
a long way to meet you

1578
01:20:51.539 --> 01:20:53.444
because you said that you could help us.

1579
01:20:53.499 --> 01:20:55.418
I said I would consider it.

1580
01:20:56.002 --> 01:20:57.336
And I have.

1581
01:20:58.671 --> 01:21:01.007
Ted, you're special.

1582
01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:03.718
You could've been an
inspiration to the world.

1583
01:21:03.885 --> 01:21:06.053
Could've been a leader, a role model.

1584
01:21:07.013 --> 01:21:08.639
Instead you're

1585
01:21:09.515 --> 01:21:10.715
Justin Bieber.

1586
01:21:11.225 --> 01:21:12.226
Fuck you!

1587
01:21:12.351 --> 01:21:13.666
- Hey, Ted! Come on!
- I'm sorry.

1588
01:21:13.686 --> 01:21:15.835
- He doesn't mean that.
- Please forgive me, I'm sorry.

1589
01:21:15.855 --> 01:21:17.148
There's just no indication

1590
01:21:17.231 --> 01:21:20.151
that you've had any positive effect
on the world around you.

1591
01:21:20.318 --> 01:21:22.987
Well, that's not true, He's
had a positive effect on me.

1592
01:21:23.154 --> 01:21:26.032
Would that positive
effect be your join to arrest

1593
01:21:26.115 --> 01:21:28.451
for purchasing marijuana in 2003?

1594
01:21:28.534 --> 01:21:31.392
Well, how the fuck do you prepare for
a Foo Fighters concert?

1595
01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.124
You know why you lost this case?

1596
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:38.711
It can't be argued by reason.

1597
01:21:39.086 --> 01:21:42.215
The precedent it sets would
affect the public directly.

1598
01:21:42.423 --> 01:21:45.676
And unfortunately, the
public doesn't judge by reason.

1599
01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.970
It judges by emotion.

1600
01:21:49.347 --> 01:21:52.183
And you can't appeal
an emotional conviction.

1601
01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.062
Nonetheless, I wish you
all the best in your efforts.

1602
01:21:58.397 --> 01:21:59.899
He needs help.

1603
01:22:00.399 --> 01:22:01.901
And from what I know about you,

1604
01:22:02.068 --> 01:22:04.640
at one point in your career
that would've been enough.

1605
01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:08.741
I'm sorry you're not who I hoped you'd be.

1606
01:22:17.458 --> 01:22:19.506
Are those Tootsie Rolls just, like to take?

1607
01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.631
Those aren't supposed to be out.

1608
01:22:34.767 --> 01:22:36.811
So that's it. I'm property.

1609
01:22:37.603 --> 01:22:39.480
No rights, no nothing.

1610
01:22:40.106 --> 01:22:43.109
Ted, dude, I'm so sorry,
man. This completely sucks.

1611
01:22:43.484 --> 01:22:44.944
I feel terrible.

1612
01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:47.446
I let you guys down all over again.

1613
01:22:47.572 --> 01:22:50.783
Hey, You didn't let us down,
Sam. You did your best.

1614
01:22:51.993 --> 01:22:53.641
And, look, regardless of all this shit,

1615
01:22:53.661 --> 01:22:56.709
you're still the best thing that's happened
to me in a long time.

1616
01:23:02.461 --> 01:23:03.462
Oh, Oh, that...

1617
01:23:03.671 --> 01:23:04.797
That's great! That's fucking great!

1618
01:23:04.881 --> 01:23:05.923
I'm glad you guys are so happy!

1619
01:23:06.007 --> 01:23:07.049
What?

1620
01:23:07.133 --> 01:23:09.156
What do you mean, What?
I'm totally screwed here.

1621
01:23:09.176 --> 01:23:11.679
And you're sitting there
basically banging my lawyer,

1622
01:23:11.762 --> 01:23:13.494
and she's probably still fucking billing us!

1623
01:23:13.514 --> 01:23:15.746
Well, don't yell at us,
dude! We didn't do anything!

1624
01:23:15.766 --> 01:23:17.059
Yeah, exactly! exactly!

1625
01:23:17.143 --> 01:23:20.293
Maybe if you guys had spent a little
less time mooning over each other,

1626
01:23:20.313 --> 01:23:23.212
Sam could've won this
thing and I wouldn't be a fucking thing!

1627
01:23:23.232 --> 01:23:25.401
Like garbage or a piece of shit!

1628
01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:28.259
Hey, we've been fighting
right alongside you the whole way.

1629
01:23:28.279 --> 01:23:29.322
And remember, you're the one

1630
01:23:29.405 --> 01:23:30.406
who's been pushing me
to get back on the horse.

1631
01:23:30.489 --> 01:23:32.471
I finally meet someone and
you're giving me shit for it?

1632
01:23:32.491 --> 01:23:34.140
Oh, no, you're right. No, Johnny, it's fine.

1633
01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.244
You're right, it's fine. It's totally fine.

1634
01:23:35.328 --> 01:23:37.747
I got no job, no marriage and no life!

1635
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:40.917
But you have fun porking Gollum here,
while I'm left with shit!

1636
01:23:41.083 --> 01:23:42.283
Ted!

1637
01:23:42.335 --> 01:23:43.377
Who's Gollum?

1638
01:23:43.461 --> 01:23:45.504
She's a model. Ted, come back!

1639
01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:46.756
Leave me alone!

1640
01:23:46.881 --> 01:23:48.081
- Ted!
- Ted!

1641
01:23:52.178 --> 01:23:53.378
Shit.

1642
01:24:04.056 --> 01:24:05.256
Whoa.

1643
01:24:05.858 --> 01:24:07.058
Sorry, bro.

1644
01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:45.690
Hey, Ted!

1645
01:24:47.733 --> 01:24:48.818
Guy?

1646
01:24:48.901 --> 01:24:50.341
I thought that was you.
What's happening, man?

1647
01:24:50.361 --> 01:24:52.363
Hey, Rick! It is Ted.

1648
01:24:52.446 --> 01:24:53.646
Hey, how you doing?

1649
01:24:53.864 --> 01:24:55.846
- Hey, what's going on?
- What are you doing here?

1650
01:24:55.866 --> 01:25:00.246
I just feel at home among the outcasts.
What are you guys doing here?

1651
01:25:00.538 --> 01:25:03.124
Well, you know, Rick and I,
we just come here as a gag.

1652
01:25:03.207 --> 01:25:06.544
Dress up like we're into this shit
and fuck with the nerds.

1653
01:25:06.627 --> 01:25:07.837
Hey, spaz.

1654
01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.206
Uh, why don't you go get me some Big
League Chew, How about that, huh?

1655
01:25:15.011 --> 01:25:17.972
Uh-huh, All right, well,
good luck with your dick, there.

1656
01:25:18.055 --> 01:25:19.432
Right on. You, too, man.

1657
01:25:20.474 --> 01:25:22.893
God damn it, that under wear had shit on it!

1658
01:25:27.773 --> 01:25:28.973
Hey.

1659
01:25:29.442 --> 01:25:30.651
Are you Ted?

1660
01:25:30.943 --> 01:25:32.611
Uh, yeah.

1661
01:25:33.988 --> 01:25:35.364
This is so exciting!

1662
01:25:35.448 --> 01:25:37.783
I was such a big fan of
yours in the early '90s.

1663
01:25:38.034 --> 01:25:40.745
Oh, thanks a lot. What's your name?

1664
01:25:40.911 --> 01:25:42.371
I'm Raphael.

1665
01:25:42.455 --> 01:25:44.729
Hey, do you think I could
take a picture with you?

1666
01:25:44.749 --> 01:25:46.167
Uh, yeah, yeah, No problem.

1667
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:48.044
Great, great! Here, follow me.

1668
01:25:49.837 --> 01:25:52.089
Uh, okay, why are we doing this back here?

1669
01:25:52.256 --> 01:25:53.340
Well, you're a celebrity.

1670
01:25:53.424 --> 01:25:55.656
I just don't want you to get mobbed
when people recognize you.

1671
01:25:55.676 --> 01:25:58.617
Yeah, that's true, I've been mistaken for an
Ewok three times today.

1672
01:25:58.637 --> 01:25:59.837
All right, let's do this.

1673
01:26:04.518 --> 01:26:06.395
Holy shit! Donny!

1674
01:26:06.854 --> 01:26:08.814
It's so good to see you, Ted.

1675
01:26:09.815 --> 01:26:11.292
It's been some time, hasn't it?

1676
01:26:11.484 --> 01:26:13.652
What, you mean since you ripped me in half?

1677
01:26:14.653 --> 01:26:16.363
That wasn't supposed to happen.

1678
01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:18.032
That was an accident.

1679
01:26:18.866 --> 01:26:21.118
I have some big plans for you, Ted.

1680
01:26:21.869 --> 01:26:23.329
Very big plans.

1681
01:26:23.829 --> 01:26:25.456
I need you to come with me now.

1682
01:26:25.623 --> 01:26:26.823
Go to hell!

1683
01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:41.514
Nice lunch, spaz.

1684
01:26:51.315 --> 01:26:52.733
Hey! What the hell!

1685
01:26:57.321 --> 01:26:59.136
He could be anywhere.
We're not gonna find him.

1686
01:26:59.156 --> 01:27:00.513
We should just wait by the car.

1687
01:27:00.533 --> 01:27:02.181
What do you mean?
We have to find him, okay?

1688
01:27:02.201 --> 01:27:04.916
He's a teddy bear on his own in New York,
for God's sakes.

1689
01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.083
Hello?

1690
01:27:09.166 --> 01:27:11.023
Johnny, Johnny, it's me.
You got to help me.

1691
01:27:11.043 --> 01:27:13.567
Ted, where are you? Dude, we've been looking
everywhere for you.

1692
01:27:13.587 --> 01:27:17.049
I'm at Comic Con, but,
John, it's Donny! He's here!

1693
01:27:17.174 --> 01:27:18.697
He's after me. You got to get over here.

1694
01:27:18.717 --> 01:27:20.366
What the fuck? Did you just say Donny?

1695
01:27:20.386 --> 01:27:21.470
John, what's going on?

1696
01:27:21.554 --> 01:27:23.097
Yes, it's him! He's...

1697
01:27:25.015 --> 01:27:26.225
Oh, shit!

1698
01:27:29.603 --> 01:27:31.230
Ted! Ted, hello?

1699
01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.338
What's the matter? Oh, my God, Déja vu.

1700
01:27:33.566 --> 01:27:35.281
We got to get to Comic Con, Come on!

1701
01:27:39.738 --> 01:27:41.407
Get out of the way!

1702
01:27:53.085 --> 01:27:54.587
You know,

1703
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:57.798
I really love that Neil Diamond.

1704
01:27:58.465 --> 01:28:03.262
Especially that song they sing
at the Red Sox games.

1705
01:28:05.055 --> 01:28:06.932
It's just so infectious.

1706
01:28:07.516 --> 01:28:09.643
You just can't help but sing along.

1707
01:28:10.811 --> 01:28:15.149
Hands touching hands

1708
01:28:16.734 --> 01:28:18.694
Reaching out

1709
01:28:19.695 --> 01:28:25.159
Touching me, touching you

1710
01:28:25.534 --> 01:28:29.205
Sweet Caroline

1711
01:28:29.288 --> 01:28:30.706
Bah, bah, bah!

1712
01:28:30.789 --> 01:28:31.989
Fuck!

1713
01:28:32.499 --> 01:28:33.699
Crazy son of a bitch!

1714
01:28:37.254 --> 01:28:38.380
Hey!

1715
01:28:38.464 --> 01:28:39.988
What are you doing to that bear?

1716
01:28:40.216 --> 01:28:41.467
I'm sorry, I, uh...

1717
01:28:41.634 --> 01:28:43.444
You better be planning on buying that!

1718
01:28:43.969 --> 01:28:46.180
He just reminds me of when I was a kid.

1719
01:28:46.263 --> 01:28:47.223
Yeah, that's great.

1720
01:28:47.306 --> 01:28:48.307
$40.

1721
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:49.642
Okay.

1722
01:28:50.809 --> 01:28:52.311
I have $40, here.

1723
01:29:02.196 --> 01:29:03.239
You see him anywhere?

1724
01:29:03.322 --> 01:29:05.074
No, Let's try in there.

1725
01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.935
Hi, have any of you guys seen a
talking teddy bear run through here?

1726
01:29:10.955 --> 01:29:13.062
Shh, They're about to announce
the new Superman.

1727
01:29:13.082 --> 01:29:15.668
The new Superman is...

1728
01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.211
Jonah Hill!

1729
01:29:17.461 --> 01:29:18.504
FUCK!

1730
01:29:18.587 --> 01:29:19.964
- Who's Superman?
- What?

1731
01:29:20.047 --> 01:29:22.333
I'm just kidding, I'm
fucking with you, Come on!

1732
01:29:22.925 --> 01:29:25.177
And if that is not big enough news,

1733
01:29:25.261 --> 01:29:28.097
Hasbro will be unveiling a brand-new line

1734
01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:31.016
of Transformers merchandise next fall.

1735
01:29:33.102 --> 01:29:34.750
We've got a brand-new line of Decepticons...

1736
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:35.771
Hey!

1737
01:29:35.854 --> 01:29:37.253
- That is gonna be...
- Fresh cakes.

1738
01:29:37.273 --> 01:29:38.774
Fresh cakes.

1739
01:29:39.858 --> 01:29:41.193
Fresh cakes.

1740
01:29:43.487 --> 01:29:44.530
Comic Con fans,

1741
01:29:44.613 --> 01:29:46.512
let's take a look at
this thrilling sizzle reel

1742
01:29:46.532 --> 01:29:48.325
with all of our exciting new toys.

1743
01:29:48.951 --> 01:29:50.151
Take a look.

1744
01:29:56.208 --> 01:29:58.585
Come on, there's an empty
supply room downstairs.

1745
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:59.670
Is that him?

1746
01:29:59.753 --> 01:30:01.755
Yeah, there was an issue, so he's

1747
01:30:01.839 --> 01:30:03.362
unconscious now, but yeah, this is him.

1748
01:30:03.382 --> 01:30:05.592
Jesus! Why did you bring him here?

1749
01:30:05.676 --> 01:30:07.825
I've been following him
around since yesterday.

1750
01:30:07.845 --> 01:30:11.307
This was the only chance I could
get him alone. I had to move fast.

1751
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:12.590
Hey, Ted!

1752
01:30:14.268 --> 01:30:15.311
Is that you?

1753
01:30:15.394 --> 01:30:17.418
Uh, yeah, he had a little too much to drink.

1754
01:30:17.438 --> 01:30:20.462
He puked a pile of cotton
all over this little girl in a stroller

1755
01:30:20.482 --> 01:30:22.985
so we're gonna take him back
and sober him up.

1756
01:30:23.068 --> 01:30:24.820
Ah, rock on, Ted.

1757
01:30:24.903 --> 01:30:26.030
Eff yeah.

1758
01:30:26.113 --> 01:30:29.908
Hey, guys, be careful out there,
Some nerd spilled his lunch.

1759
01:30:30.451 --> 01:30:32.451
Hey, watch that floor. Comes up fast, man.

1760
01:30:38.917 --> 01:30:40.169
Hey, Johnny.

1761
01:30:40.252 --> 01:30:41.452
Guy?

1762
01:30:41.587 --> 01:30:43.881
Man, it's a goddamn party here today.

1763
01:30:44.214 --> 01:30:46.050
Hey, I remember you from the wedding.

1764
01:30:46.216 --> 01:30:48.093
- You get a nose job?
- No.

1765
01:30:48.427 --> 01:30:50.095
Yes, you did, you fucking liar.

1766
01:30:50.179 --> 01:30:51.785
Hey, we just ran into your buddy Ted.

1767
01:30:51.805 --> 01:30:52.848
Ted? Where is he?

1768
01:30:52.931 --> 01:30:56.360
He got a little wasted, so these two
dudes took him out back to sober up.

1769
01:30:56.435 --> 01:30:57.436
Did you see which way they went?

1770
01:30:57.561 --> 01:30:59.418
Yeah, yeah, Baok hallway,
past the photo booth.

1771
01:30:59.438 --> 01:31:00.638
Come on!

1772
01:31:01.398 --> 01:31:02.608
Thirsty, Urkel?

1773
01:31:03.942 --> 01:31:05.611
I fucking love this place.

1774
01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:17.206
What the fuck? What the fuck's
going on here?

1775
01:31:17.373 --> 01:31:18.573
Who the hell are you?

1776
01:31:18.665 --> 01:31:21.043
He really is extraordinary, isn't he?

1777
01:31:21.126 --> 01:31:23.545
You son of a bitch! This is kidnapping!

1778
01:31:23.712 --> 01:31:25.464
No, it's not.

1779
01:31:25.714 --> 01:31:30.135
Kidnapping only applies to people.
And you, Ted, you're property.

1780
01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:32.137
Yeah, so is that fucking hairpiece.

1781
01:31:35.933 --> 01:31:37.600
What do you say there, happy face'?

1782
01:31:37.643 --> 01:31:40.729
Right there, Death to Ming.
Yeah! Come on, All right.

1783
01:31:40.813 --> 01:31:42.314
Happy guy.

1784
01:31:42.481 --> 01:31:45.818
Right there, Death to Ming.
Good, yeah.

1785
01:31:47.653 --> 01:31:48.904
Hey, Bennett!

1786
01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.281
Oh, shit!

1787
01:31:51.365 --> 01:31:52.825
You messed up my car.

1788
01:31:52.908 --> 01:31:54.451
What the hell is wrong with you?

1789
01:31:54.535 --> 01:31:57.184
Look, Sam, this is a really bad time,
all right? Something happened to Ted.

1790
01:31:57.204 --> 01:32:00.707
But it was a good time for you to vandalize
my Chrysler though.

1791
01:32:00.791 --> 01:32:02.543
Hey, fuck your Chrysler!

1792
01:32:11.885 --> 01:32:13.095
Holy shit!

1793
01:32:13.178 --> 01:32:15.514
Look, Donny, Donny!
You don't wanna do this! Okay?

1794
01:32:15.806 --> 01:32:17.521
Think about what happened at Fenway.

1795
01:32:17.599 --> 01:32:21.103
You remember? You cut me open,
that's it! I'm gone, dead!

1796
01:32:21.687 --> 01:32:23.272
Just a regular old teddy bear.

1797
01:32:23.355 --> 01:32:25.399
I won't be any fun then, will I?

1798
01:32:25.691 --> 01:32:27.359
This isn't about you, Ted.

1799
01:32:27.901 --> 01:32:29.403
You're only one bear.

1800
01:32:29.736 --> 01:32:31.468
We're gonna figure out what makes you real,

1801
01:32:31.488 --> 01:32:33.137
and then we're gonna make millions of Teds.

1802
01:32:33.157 --> 01:32:35.117
One for every child in the world.

1803
01:32:35.659 --> 01:32:37.035
One for me.

1804
01:32:39.079 --> 01:32:41.957
One that loves me just
as much as you love John.

1805
01:32:42.207 --> 01:32:44.793
Look, Donny, I can never love you.

1806
01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:47.713
God, that sounds fucked up.
Listen, I don't wanna die.

1807
01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.080
Okay? So, uh...

1808
01:32:49.298 --> 01:32:51.060
What if I gave you a hand job outside

1809
01:32:51.133 --> 01:32:52.943
your pants while you ate an ice cream?

1810
01:32:56.054 --> 01:32:57.723
I'll give you a minute.

1811
01:33:04.062 --> 01:33:05.262
Come here!

1812
01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.307
Hey, check it out, Nerd fight.

1813
01:33:40.641 --> 01:33:41.841
Ah!

1814
01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:54.770
Come here.

1815
01:34:00.786 --> 01:34:01.986
Come on.

1816
01:34:08.585 --> 01:34:10.420
I'll see you in heaven, Ted.

1817
01:34:17.886 --> 01:34:19.555
- Ted!
- Johnny!

1818
01:34:19.721 --> 01:34:20.921
Who the hell are you?

1819
01:34:21.306 --> 01:34:23.183
Get away from him, you bastard!

1820
01:34:23.267 --> 01:34:25.415
- Ted, you okay, buddy?
- Oh, Johnny, thank God!

1821
01:34:25.435 --> 01:34:26.436
I'm out.

1822
01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.919
Wait, Mr. Jessup, please don't go,
Come on, we can still do this.

1823
01:34:28.939 --> 01:34:31.630
You're on your own, Danny.
I can't be implicated in any of this.

1824
01:34:31.650 --> 01:34:33.079
Wait, wait, wait. Who are you?

1825
01:34:33.151 --> 01:34:34.653
I work for Mattel.

1826
01:34:36.655 --> 01:34:37.990
You piece of shit.

1827
01:34:38.156 --> 01:34:40.728
Killing him at Fenway Park
wasn't enough for you, huh?

1828
01:34:40.951 --> 01:34:42.182
What do you wanna do now?!

1829
01:34:42.202 --> 01:34:45.747
You don't deserve him, John.
You never did, you never did!

1830
01:34:46.039 --> 01:34:48.182
I've been wanting to
do this for a long time.

1831
01:34:50.502 --> 01:34:51.702
A-ha! I fucking knew it!

1832
01:34:52.713 --> 01:34:53.964
Come on.

1833
01:35:05.642 --> 01:35:08.729
Listen, Johnny, I wanna
tell you how sorry I am.

1834
01:35:08.895 --> 01:35:10.105
No, forget it, buddy.

1835
01:35:10.188 --> 01:35:13.046
Look, Teddy, you were upset, and I shouldn't
have brushed it off, I'm so sorry.

1836
01:35:13.066 --> 01:35:14.151
No, listen to me.

1837
01:35:14.234 --> 01:35:16.486
Just listen to me. You, too, Sam.

1838
01:35:16.570 --> 01:35:18.530
I acted like an asshole.

1839
01:35:18.614 --> 01:35:22.200
All right? I was just hurting
because I knew I'd lost.

1840
01:35:22.993 --> 01:35:27.122
And that, in the eyes of the
world, I'll always be property.

1841
01:35:27.873 --> 01:35:30.292
But you know what? Who gives a shit? Right?

1842
01:35:30.375 --> 01:35:33.670
It doesn't matter what
the world calls me, I know who I am.

1843
01:35:34.046 --> 01:35:35.570
And that's all that's important.

1844
01:35:36.256 --> 01:35:38.008
And I know who my friends are.

1845
01:35:38.425 --> 01:35:39.718
And honest to God,

1846
01:35:39.801 --> 01:35:43.305
if you two want to be together,
nothing would make me happier.

1847
01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.157
Aw, buddy, I love you for that.

1848
01:35:45.223 --> 01:35:47.100
Thanks, Ted. That means a lot.

1849
01:35:49.269 --> 01:35:52.564
And for what it's worth,
as far as I'm concerned,

1850
01:35:53.190 --> 01:35:54.399
you're a person.

1851
01:35:54.858 --> 01:35:57.152
As much as anybody I've ever known.

1852
01:35:57.235 --> 01:36:02.074
Sam, that means the world coming
from someone who went to Arizona State.

1853
01:36:18.423 --> 01:36:19.623
Ted!

1854
01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:29.893
Holy shit! Johnny!

1855
01:36:30.018 --> 01:36:31.853
- Oh, my God, John!
- Johnny!

1856
01:36:31.937 --> 01:36:33.146
John!
Oh, Jesus!

1857
01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:34.753
- Are you okay?
- Johnny, you all right?

1858
01:36:34.773 --> 01:36:35.774
Shit.

1859
01:36:35.857 --> 01:36:37.192
- John, hey.
- Oh, my God.

1860
01:36:37.275 --> 01:36:38.527
Jesus, what happened here?

1861
01:36:38.610 --> 01:36:39.991
The rocket ship just hit him!

1862
01:36:40.112 --> 01:36:42.427
Jesus Christ, that's
the Starship Enterprise... Forget it.

1863
01:36:42.447 --> 01:36:43.865
Somebody call 911!

1864
01:36:43.949 --> 01:36:45.902
Johnny? John, come on, stay with me, pal.

1865
01:36:45.951 --> 01:36:48.203
We need an ambulance at 655 West 34th.

1866
01:36:48.286 --> 01:36:49.538
How the hell did it fall?

1867
01:36:49.621 --> 01:36:50.821
I don't know!

1868
01:36:53.667 --> 01:36:54.710
It was him!

1869
01:36:54.793 --> 01:36:57.169
The guy dressed like the Ninja Turtle!

1870
01:37:01.591 --> 01:37:02.634
Which one?

1871
01:37:02.801 --> 01:37:06.430
All right, two can play this Where's
Waldo shit, you son of a bitch!

1872
01:37:06.513 --> 01:37:07.764
Sam, give me your phone.

1873
01:37:27.993 --> 01:37:29.193
That's him.

1874
01:37:32.956 --> 01:37:34.156
Get off me!

1875
01:37:34.624 --> 01:37:35.876
Get off me!

1876
01:37:38.295 --> 01:37:39.504
Johnny?

1877
01:37:39.963 --> 01:37:41.163
Johnny, come on.

1878
01:37:41.798 --> 01:37:43.425
Johnny, you got to wake up, pal.

1879
01:37:44.009 --> 01:37:45.209
Johnny, wake up!

1880
01:37:45.802 --> 01:37:47.220
Wake up, Johnny.

1881
01:37:48.138 --> 01:37:49.556
Johnny.

1882
01:37:49.639 --> 01:37:51.016
Johnny, wake up!

1883
01:37:52.392 --> 01:37:54.227
Johnny, wake up.

1884
01:38:39.731 --> 01:38:42.567
Hi, How is he? Is he gonna come out of it?

1885
01:38:42.901 --> 01:38:45.779
I don't know, Ms. Jackson.
We've done everything we can

1886
01:38:45.987 --> 01:38:47.989
and it's all up to him now.

1887
01:38:58.083 --> 01:38:59.283
John,

1888
01:39:00.085 --> 01:39:01.753
please wake up.

1889
01:39:10.387 --> 01:39:11.388
Somebody help!

1890
01:39:11.471 --> 01:39:13.091
- Oh, my God, John!
- John? Johnny?

1891
01:39:13.181 --> 01:39:15.100
Hello? There's something happening.

1892
01:39:15.308 --> 01:39:16.508
Mr. Bennett?

1893
01:39:16.810 --> 01:39:18.792
Something's wrong, What's going on?
What's happening to him?

1894
01:39:18.812 --> 01:39:20.272
Mr. Bennett? John?

1895
01:39:21.106 --> 01:39:23.505
We have a Code Blue in Room 134!
What does that mean?

1896
01:39:23.525 --> 01:39:24.923
I'm sorry, You three are
gonna have to wait outside.

1897
01:39:24.943 --> 01:39:26.258
What the hell is going
on? Is he gonna be okay?

1898
01:39:26.278 --> 01:39:27.320
The doctors will do everything they can,

1899
01:39:27.404 --> 01:39:29.553
but I need you to go to the
waiting area now, please.

1900
01:39:29.573 --> 01:39:30.773
Excuse me, excuse me.

1901
01:39:30.824 --> 01:39:31.867
What's the status?

1902
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:33.598
He was stable a minute ago
and now he's unresponsive.

1903
01:39:33.618 --> 01:39:35.851
The monitor says he's in asystole,
He's not breathing, no pulse.

1904
01:39:35.871 --> 01:39:37.561
Start compressions. Prepare to intubate.

1905
01:39:37.581 --> 01:39:39.296
Give him a milligram of epinephrine.

1906
01:40:09.029 --> 01:40:10.655
I'm sorry.

1907
01:40:12.115 --> 01:40:13.315
He didn't make it.

1908
01:40:16.953 --> 01:40:18.153
What?

1909
01:40:19.497 --> 01:40:20.707
Johnny.

1910
01:40:21.458 --> 01:40:23.627
If you'd like, you can go in

1911
01:40:23.710 --> 01:40:25.378
and say your goodbyes.

1912
01:41:05.210 --> 01:41:06.503
Johnny.

1913
01:41:08.713 --> 01:41:10.632
You were my thunder buddy.

1914
01:41:13.051 --> 01:41:15.470
You were my thunder buddy for life.

1915
01:41:17.806 --> 01:41:21.559
And you gave up your own life to save mine.

1916
01:41:24.854 --> 01:41:26.606
The only problem is

1917
01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:32.153
I don't know how my life works without you.

1918
01:41:36.449 --> 01:41:37.909
Goodbye, John.

1919
01:41:41.121 --> 01:41:43.039
I got you, motherfucker!

1920
01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:46.835
Holy shit! Zombie! He's a fucking zombie!

1921
01:41:47.585 --> 01:41:49.254
I totally fucking got you!

1922
01:41:50.088 --> 01:41:51.214
Holy shit!

1923
01:41:51.297 --> 01:41:53.155
You should have seen your fucking face!

1924
01:41:53.383 --> 01:41:54.634
You son of a bitch!

1925
01:41:54.718 --> 01:41:56.219
That was fucking classic!

1926
01:41:56.302 --> 01:41:59.285
Wait, wait, wait, this is payback because
I made you think that I was retarded!

1927
01:41:59.305 --> 01:42:00.745
You made me think you were retarded!

1928
01:42:00.765 --> 01:42:01.808
Oh! Well done!

1929
01:42:01.933 --> 01:42:03.685
Well done, man, High five.

1930
01:42:03.768 --> 01:42:04.811
High five.

1931
01:42:04.936 --> 01:42:06.938
What the fuck is going on?!

1932
01:42:07.022 --> 01:42:11.192
What's going on, is this guy
just won the bullshit comedy blue ribbon.

1933
01:42:11.276 --> 01:42:13.820
You are the fucking greatest man Holy shit!

1934
01:42:14.279 --> 01:42:16.031
Wait, How was the doctor in on it?

1935
01:42:16.114 --> 01:42:18.263
They got me out of it with
the paddles. I was totally fine.

1936
01:42:18.283 --> 01:42:19.723
So I talked him into
going along with the bit.

1937
01:42:19.743 --> 01:42:21.743
Hey, Doc, it worked out hilarious, thanks.

1938
01:42:21.953 --> 01:42:23.955
No problem. We're a fun hospital.

1939
01:42:24.247 --> 01:42:27.417
You asshole! You think this shit is funny?

1940
01:42:27.667 --> 01:42:29.232
Do you know how devastated I was?

1941
01:42:29.252 --> 01:42:30.920
I put a frowny face on Facebook!

1942
01:42:31.004 --> 01:42:33.423
How am I supposed to
explain that to everybody?

1943
01:42:33.715 --> 01:42:35.822
You could change your
relationship status from "single"

1944
01:42:35.842 --> 01:42:38.011
to "it's complicated.

1945
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:40.709
You're gonna have to
do a lot better than that.

1946
01:42:41.514 --> 01:42:45.226
How about, in a relationship
with John Bennett?

1947
01:42:46.019 --> 01:42:49.647
Well, we'll have to talk about that.

1948
01:42:54.527 --> 01:42:56.154
Okay, well, good talk.

1949
01:43:01.659 --> 01:43:03.058
Hey, if you guys want to bang,

1950
01:43:03.078 --> 01:43:04.517
me and Teddy can totally leave the room.

1951
01:43:04.537 --> 01:43:06.853
No, no, honey, honey, they're
classy, they're not like us.

1952
01:43:06.873 --> 01:43:08.541
They're good people.

1953
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:11.795
I'm happy to see everyone
has made a full recovery.

1954
01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.004
- Mr. Meighan.
- What the hell?

1955
01:43:13.088 --> 01:43:14.214
Holy shit!

1956
01:43:14.297 --> 01:43:15.678
Is it all right if I come in?

1957
01:43:16.132 --> 01:43:17.550
Sure, yeah.

1958
01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:19.886
How are you feeling, John?

1959
01:43:20.303 --> 01:43:21.638
I'm alive.

1960
01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:23.640
You're very lucky.

1961
01:43:23.807 --> 01:43:25.725
I saw what you did on TV.

1962
01:43:25.892 --> 01:43:28.019
Yeah, he saved my ass is what he did.

1963
01:43:28.186 --> 01:43:30.980
You know why? Because he's a person.

1964
01:43:31.356 --> 01:43:32.440
And no matter how many

1965
01:43:32.524 --> 01:43:34.089
of you smart-ass Harvard
lawyers try to keep him down,

1966
01:43:34.109 --> 01:43:35.381
you're not gonna change that.

1967
01:43:35.401 --> 01:43:36.820
Not in our eyes.

1968
01:43:37.028 --> 01:43:38.228
Ted is real.

1969
01:43:38.488 --> 01:43:40.031
So you can go fuck yourself.

1970
01:43:40.949 --> 01:43:42.242
I will.

1971
01:43:42.867 --> 01:43:45.411
And as soon as I'm done fucking myself,

1972
01:43:45.787 --> 01:43:47.789
I'd like to take your case, Ted.

1973
01:43:48.039 --> 01:43:49.082
- What?
- Seriously?

1974
01:43:49.165 --> 01:43:50.792
- Oh, my God!
- You heard that?

1975
01:43:50.875 --> 01:43:52.752
- Oh, my gosh!
- I don't believe it!

1976
01:43:54.045 --> 01:43:55.735
- Maybe we don't want you now.
- Shut up.

1977
01:43:55.755 --> 01:43:57.779
No, yeah, we want you.
For sure, we want you.

1978
01:43:57.799 --> 01:43:59.676
What made you change your mind?

1979
01:43:59.843 --> 01:44:01.970
Well, when I saw what John did for you,

1980
01:44:02.804 --> 01:44:05.557
that he was willing to
give his life for yours,

1981
01:44:05.974 --> 01:44:07.976
it gave me a kick in the ass.

1982
01:44:08.059 --> 01:44:11.271
Reminded me of why I chose
to do the kind of work I do.

1983
01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.691
I'm sorry I turned you away.

1984
01:44:14.774 --> 01:44:16.151
I was wrong.

1985
01:44:16.901 --> 01:44:18.444
As far as I'm concerned,

1986
01:44:18.695 --> 01:44:22.866
anyone who can inspire that
kind of love in another person

1987
01:44:22.949 --> 01:44:24.826
deserves to be called human.

1988
01:44:25.994 --> 01:44:27.078
You mean it?

1989
01:44:27.162 --> 01:44:28.746
I certainly do.

1990
01:44:29.622 --> 01:44:30.822
So,

1991
01:44:30.915 --> 01:44:32.542
shall we get started?

1992
01:44:42.844 --> 01:44:44.512
What defines a person?

1993
01:44:46.931 --> 01:44:48.641
What defines property?

1994
01:44:49.809 --> 01:44:51.436
What's the difference?

1995
01:44:53.146 --> 01:44:57.442
The anthropologist and
ethioist Dawn Prince-Hughes

1996
01:44:57.817 --> 01:45:02.947
argues that the standards for
personhood include self-awareness,

1997
01:45:03.615 --> 01:45:06.784
an ability to understand complex emotions

1998
01:45:07.118 --> 01:45:09.662
and a capacity for empathy.

1999
01:45:11.497 --> 01:45:16.461
We're all in agreement
that Ted is self-aware.

2000
01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.080
What is your name?

2001
01:45:20.632 --> 01:45:22.175
Ted Clubber Lang.

2002
01:45:26.888 --> 01:45:30.350
As for complex emotions
and the capacity for empathy,

2003
01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:33.353
we all saw the distressing images

2004
01:45:33.436 --> 01:45:35.897
of Ted agonizing over his fallen friend,

2005
01:45:36.397 --> 01:45:37.597
John Bennett.

2006
01:45:37.941 --> 01:45:39.609
In those images,

2007
01:45:39.734 --> 01:45:44.781
Ted exhibits all of the
remaining qualities of personhood.

2008
01:45:46.908 --> 01:45:49.285
It's right there for anyone to see.

2009
01:45:50.495 --> 01:45:54.874
And I believe that a just
court must, by definition,

2010
01:45:55.708 --> 01:45:59.545
grant basic human rights to
all those who deserve them,

2011
01:46:00.838 --> 01:46:03.549
just as the Emancipation Proclamation

2012
01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.345
and the Thirteenth Amendment
did so many years ago.

2013
01:46:09.931 --> 01:46:12.558
So, ladies and gentlemen of the court,

2014
01:46:14.727 --> 01:46:16.646
I invite you

2015
01:46:18.022 --> 01:46:20.233
to change the world.

2016
01:46:39.836 --> 01:46:42.964
Well, Johnny, this is the
second time you've made me real.

2017
01:46:43.715 --> 01:46:44.841
Thanks, pal.

2018
01:46:44.924 --> 01:46:46.801
Hey, you were always real to me, buddy.

2019
01:46:46.968 --> 01:46:48.168
Even when you weren't.

2020
01:46:48.303 --> 01:46:49.554
Congratulations, Ted.

2021
01:46:49.929 --> 01:46:51.222
Thanks, Sam.

2022
01:46:53.182 --> 01:46:54.382
Ted!

2023
01:46:54.559 --> 01:46:56.436
- Ted!
- Ted! Over here!

2024
01:46:56.519 --> 01:46:57.729
Ted!

2025
01:46:59.105 --> 01:47:00.898
This is quite a victory for you.

2026
01:47:00.982 --> 01:47:03.131
Is there any statement
that you'd like to make

2027
01:47:03.151 --> 01:47:04.723
now that you're legally a person?

2028
01:47:05.111 --> 01:47:06.529
Yes, there is.

2029
01:47:08.948 --> 01:47:10.450
Tami-Lynn McCafferty,

2030
01:47:10.825 --> 01:47:12.493
will you marry me?

2031
01:47:14.078 --> 01:47:15.278
Yes.

2032
01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.755
And so our story comes to an end.

2033
01:47:24.088 --> 01:47:27.050
Ted and Tami-Lynn were married once again,

2034
01:47:27.133 --> 01:47:31.846
and soon afterward, they
adopted a fine, young baby boy.

2035
01:47:32.096 --> 01:47:34.265
Johnny, meet your new godson,

2036
01:47:34.432 --> 01:47:36.184
Apollo Creed Clubber Lang.

2037
01:47:36.267 --> 01:47:38.353
Oh, Teddy, he's adorable.

2038
01:47:38.519 --> 01:47:41.189
Oh! And we got something
for him, too. John, show him.

2039
01:47:41.272 --> 01:47:42.690
Oh, shit, yeah, Hold on.

2040
01:47:42.774 --> 01:47:44.233
He got you something.

2041
01:47:45.818 --> 01:47:46.861
Huh?

2042
01:47:46.944 --> 01:47:48.363
Oh, Johnny!

2043
01:47:48.529 --> 01:47:50.406
Oh, Johnny, it's perfect.

2044
01:47:50.573 --> 01:47:53.409
Hey, you know, maybe someday,
if you wish hard enough,

2045
01:47:53.576 --> 01:47:54.911
maybe he'll come to life

2046
01:47:55.078 --> 01:47:57.364
and you guys can do all
kinds of drugs together.

2047
01:47:57.497 --> 01:47:59.207
That's all I want for him.

2048
01:47:59.290 --> 01:48:03.211
Oh! It smells like somebody's
got a poopy diaper.

2049
01:48:03.378 --> 01:48:04.859
Teddy, it's your turn to change him.

2050
01:48:04.879 --> 01:48:06.214
Oh, yeah, no problem.

2051
01:48:07.006 --> 01:48:09.467
- Oh! Fuck me!
- What's the matter?
