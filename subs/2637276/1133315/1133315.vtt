2
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.746
We are often told that happily ever afters

3
00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:39.548
exists only in the pages of fairy tales.

4
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.358
And in the naive minds
of sheltered innocents.

5
00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:47.160
And yet on this bright
sunny Boston afternoon,

6
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:50.733
a talking teddybear is about
to marry his girlfriend.

7
00:00:51.197 --> 00:00:53.476
Proving two things.

8
00:00:53.478 --> 00:00:56.077
Happy endings can come true for anyone

9
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.620
and America doesnt give a
shit about anything.

10
00:01:00.384 --> 00:01:02.401
Do you Tami-Lynn McCafferty

11
00:01:02.842 --> 00:01:04.119
take this teddy bear

12
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.250
- to be your lawfully wedded husband?

13
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:08.484
- I do!

14
00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:13.114
And do you, Ted, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

15
00:01:13.844 --> 00:01:15.910
Fucking right I do!

16
00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.127
Then by the power vested in me

17
00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:22.334
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

18
00:01:22.618 --> 00:01:23.899
You may kiss the bear.

19
00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:49.592
Ladies and gentlemen, your newlyweds!

20
00:01:57.611 --> 00:02:00.013
Teddy this is the best day of my life!

21
00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:02.045
- I just love you so much!

22
00:02:02.193 --> 00:02:04.091
- I love you too Tammy!

23
00:02:04.092 --> 00:02:07.030
I'm gonna go 50 shades of bear on you tonight!

24
00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.081
- Let's go get chippies.
- Ok.

25
00:02:11.707 --> 00:02:13.441
Thank you.

26
00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:18.866
- Hey, congratulations.

27
00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:20.089
- Oh! Hi guys.

28
00:02:20.392 --> 00:02:21.547
Beautiful ceremony.

29
00:02:21.572 --> 00:02:24.490
Oh thank you so much
for being part of it.

30
00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:25.964
- Hey, this is my new boyfriend Rick.

31
00:02:26.034 --> 00:02:27.159
- How you doing?

32
00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:28.668
Good, good.

33
00:02:28.754 --> 00:02:30.410
He is a gourmet chef.

34
00:02:30.413 --> 00:02:32.882
So he knows how to toss a salad.

35
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:39.699
Rick and I are actually about to tie the knot.

36
00:02:39.915 --> 00:02:41.516
Oh, are you guys getting married?

37
00:02:41.712 --> 00:02:43.538
No, we're just gonna go home
and tie our dicks together.

38
00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:45.031
-Hah! Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

39
00:02:45.062 --> 00:02:46.413
-Deal?
-Deal!

40
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:54.844
Hey buddy.

41
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:55.912
 Are you okay?

42
00:02:56.225 --> 00:02:57.397
You look a little down.

43
00:02:57.605 --> 00:03:00.130
Are you still shaking of that
hangover from the bachelor party?

44
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.036
- Oh! This is nice.
- She's fucking begging for it!

45
00:03:04.286 --> 00:03:07.187
She's totally. Yeah, get in there.

46
00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:08.924
Look out, she want's it bad.

47
00:03:09.664 --> 00:03:12.043
She want's more than just a fucking pizza delivery.

48
00:03:12.976 --> 00:03:15.272
That's bigger than the average bear, I'll tell you that.

49
00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:17.282
Hey, do you now what's fucked up?

50
00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.717
That is someone's fucking daughter!

51
00:03:19.718 --> 00:03:21.210
Oh Jesus, come on!

52
00:03:22.658 --> 00:03:24.094
No I'm fine.

53
00:03:25.123 --> 00:03:26.472
I was just thinking about Lori.

54
00:03:27.177 --> 00:03:28.285
Oh Johnny, come on,

55
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.141
Man it's been six
months since you guys got divorced.

56
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.964
I know! I know! It's just...

57
00:03:33.148 --> 00:03:34.962
Being back in that church again?

58
00:03:35.745 --> 00:03:38.367
Everything seemed to be so perfect.

59
00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.289
Yeah well. You're not the frst guy that marry the wrong girl.

60
00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:44.172
Hey, big day huh bud?

61
00:03:44.503 --> 00:03:47.241
Do you guys want to celebrate with a little...(!!)

62
00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:52.149
Oh! No Thanks Sam! Tami-Lynn would kill me
if I did drugs on our wedding day.

63
00:03:52.174 --> 00:03:53.747
Ah, she wont notice.

64
00:03:54.012 --> 00:03:56.047
I just did a line
with a dude  in the mensroom

65
00:03:56.168 --> 00:03:58.638
and I bet you can't even spot him.

66
00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:07.829
Yeah, I'm gonna pass!

67
00:04:30.135 --> 00:04:32.669
This is the best day of my life!

69
00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:18.758
One year later ...

70
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.870
I'm starving! What the hell are you doing over there?

71
00:07:25.018 --> 00:07:27.061
I'm carrying cancer! I'm
cooking your fucking steak!

72
00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:28.644
What do you think I'm doing?

73
00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:31.051
What, I think you're doing? I think you're bleeding us dry.

74
00:07:31.053 --> 00:07:32.586
Look at this, look at this!

75
00:07:32.588 --> 00:07:35.455
129 dollars at Filings Basement!

76
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.613
What are you buying with that Tami?

77
00:07:37.408 --> 00:07:39.142
I need clothes for work alright Teddy!

78
00:07:39.177 --> 00:07:40.469
What do you mean? You wear a  smock

79
00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:42.497
- You're a fucking cashier!
- Yeah and so are you!

80
00:07:43.014 --> 00:07:45.686
Yes, exactly and I'm not going
out buying designer shit.

81
00:07:46.046 --> 00:07:47.980
No, no! You're just buying weed.

82
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.862
You're just buying drugs, you should fucking talk.

83
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:51.226
I was talking.

84
00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:53.362
I was just talking just now until you interupted me.

85
00:07:53.488 --> 00:07:56.427
Well, I had to interupt you otherwise I
wouldn't get a chance to say fucking anything.

86
00:07:56.774 --> 00:07:58.776
- Are you going to let me finish talking?
- You're just cutting me off!

87
00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.512
- Are you going to let me finnish talking?
- You know what?

88
00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:02.983
I'm good at my work. I'm
trying to calimb corporate feds.

89
00:08:03.008 --> 00:08:04.880
Nobody is in there
to look at your ass.

90
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.593
- You're acting like an asshole!
- What am I acting like?

91
00:08:07.595 --> 00:08:09.737
What am I acting like?

92
00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:12.805
Like an asshole! That's what you're acting like.

93
00:08:12.806 --> 00:08:15.276
You dont have to dress like Elizabeth Taylor
to put a jam in a plastic bag.

94
00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:17.481
I am the face of the business, okay?

95
00:08:17.483 --> 00:08:20.086
The face of business? Jesus Christ!

96
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:21.187
Listen to you,

97
00:08:21.212 --> 00:08:23.028

Oh for Christ's sake!

00:08:53.755 --> 00:08:54.747
You shut the fuck up!

00:08:56.751 --> 00:08:58.976

118
00:09:15.923 --> 00:09:17.926
- Hey, I'm really sorry!
- Yes me too.

119
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.495
- She's worse than us.
- Yes, she is our enemy now.

120
00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:31.038
You guys. at least they have tried marriage therapy?

121
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.794
Oh God, yeah, it was a freaking disaster.

122
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.435
$ 250 and we did not learn a God damn thing.

123
00:09:35.781 --> 00:09:39.123
250? That's ridiculous, doesn't the
insurance cover that or something?

124
00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:41.860
No, Tami-Lynn tried to sign up
for Obama care on the internet,

125
00:09:41.928 --> 00:09:44.510
but I came back after five minutes,
she was looking at black cocks.

126
00:09:44.762 --> 00:09:47.566
Seems like everytime you go online
you're two clicks away from black cocks.

127
00:09:49.065 --> 00:09:49.854
Look, see?

128
00:09:49.917 --> 00:09:51.406
 I googled Grand Canyon.

129
00:09:52.234 --> 00:09:54.570
Here. Look, it says did you mean black cocks.

130
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:58.203
I don't know man, I gotta do something
or my marriage is going to collapse.

131
00:09:58.975 --> 00:10:01.578
Here you go guys. We're gonna be closing in a few.

132
00:10:02.305 --> 00:10:05.548
I'm going to this after at my
friends apartment if you wanna join?

133
00:10:05.847 --> 00:10:08.328
Thanks Allison, but I got an early date tomorrow.

134
00:10:08.786 --> 00:10:10.722
Oh okey. Well.

135
00:10:10.992 --> 00:10:13.931
If you change your mind, here's the address.

136
00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:18.272
I put my cell number there too.

137
00:10:20.246 --> 00:10:21.098
- Oh, my God!

138
00:10:21.294 --> 00:10:22.748
Are you fucking kidding me?

139
00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:23.440
- What?

140
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.902
What do you mean what? After hours?
She totally wants to sleep with you!

141
00:10:27.737 --> 00:10:28.397
I'm not into it.

142
00:10:28.555 --> 00:10:30.848
John, you've been saying
that for a year and a half

143
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.750
about every chick that has
throwed herself at you.

144
00:10:32.928 --> 00:10:34.199
But you gotta get back in the game man!

145
00:10:34.373 --> 00:10:35.862
No don't start this shit alright?

146
00:10:35.922 --> 00:10:38.363
Look, I wasted six years of my life
with the wrong girl and got burned.

147
00:10:38.565 --> 00:10:40.340
- I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

148
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.892
- Jesus Johnny.

149
00:10:41.479 --> 00:10:43.662
You're not gonna marry Allison,
you're just gonna bang her,

150
00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:44.500
- and maybe pee a little on her.

151
00:10:44.754 --> 00:10:45.480
- What?

152
00:10:46.419 --> 00:10:49.224
It's always good to find new
ways to surprise your lover.

153
00:10:49.447 --> 00:10:50.980
Yeah, I gotta take a leak.

154
00:10:53.303 --> 00:10:54.765
Sorry Allison, I tried.

155
00:10:55.746 --> 00:10:58.114
It's okay I just wish he wasn't so God damn cute.

156
00:10:58.433 --> 00:11:01.839
Yeah, hey, can I get a Jack Daniels with a splash of grape juice?

157
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.750
Wish I could help you but we're closing.

158
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:06.663
One drink and I promise I won't tell anyone that Jay Leno

159
00:11:06.688 --> 00:11:08.491
comes in here for gay bathroom sex.

160
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.866
What the fuck are doing? Get off me!

161
00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:13.149
Sorry! My mistake.

162
00:11:21.006 --> 00:11:22.778
Here we go. Thanks alot come again.

163
00:11:30.292 --> 00:11:32.494
- Hey.
- Hello.

164
00:11:33.622 --> 00:11:36.212
I'd like to ask a few questions about this breakfast cereal.

165
00:11:36.891 --> 00:11:38.834
- Yeah, box of Trix.

166
00:11:39.851 --> 00:11:40.437
- That's right.

167
00:11:40.756 --> 00:11:45.497
I've been led to understand that Trix
are exclusively for children, is that correct?

168
00:11:46.728 --> 00:11:50.401
Well, I mean they say Trix is for kids in the commercials.

169
00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:53.898
- And is that enforced by law?

170
00:11:54.859 --> 00:11:56.755
- Um not to my knowledge, no.

171
00:11:57.553 --> 00:12:01.167
So if I purchases these Trix there'll be no trouble?

172
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.711
No, no, you should be fine.

173
00:12:04.633 --> 00:12:07.236
You do understand that I myself are not a child?

174
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.982
I was able to sniff that out, yeah.

175
00:12:11.678 --> 00:12:13.612
Okay, I'm gonna bring these back to my appartment.

176
00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:16.306
Umm yeah, you'll be okay.

177
00:12:18.452 --> 00:12:21.124
- And uh...I wont be followed?
- Ah no, thats...

178
00:12:21.353 --> 00:12:22.626
That's not in our budget here.

179
00:12:26.144 --> 00:12:29.509
Hey, I wont forget what you have done for me here today.

180
00:12:30.494 --> 00:12:32.020
I would prefer if you do.

181
00:12:38.387 --> 00:12:40.255
Jesus Christ!

182
00:12:50.213 --> 00:12:52.682
- You two still not talking?
- No.

183
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.547
Honest to God Joy, I don't know how to fix this.

184
00:12:55.604 --> 00:12:58.537
I mean, how the hell do you take a
broken marriage and make it work again?

185
00:12:58.662 --> 00:13:01.800
Well, I tell you one way.
You have yourself a baby.

186
00:13:02.191 --> 00:13:04.795
- A baby?
- Uhu! Look at that.

187
00:13:04.955 --> 00:13:06.483
- You see those white niggers over there?

188
00:13:07.602 --> 00:13:08.376
- Yeah, what?

189
00:13:08.715 --> 00:13:10.199
Look at them. They're so happy.

190
00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:12.744
Because they got that little baby keeping them together.

191
00:13:13.297 --> 00:13:17.169
If they didn't have that baby, they'd just be two sad ass white niggers

192
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.856
- Waiting for Downton Abby to come home.
- Why, you said that twice.

193
00:13:19.888 --> 00:13:23.204
- Is that an actual phrase or...
- I'm telling you Ted, you'll better

194
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:24.857
have a baby or your marriage is over,

195
00:13:25.201 --> 00:13:25.762
trust me.

Final Edit &  Resync

198
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:37.317
Hey.

199
00:13:38.564 --> 00:13:39.590
- Go away Teddy.

200
00:13:39.923 --> 00:13:41.578
- Tami, listen, I just want to talk to you.

201
00:13:42.014 --> 00:13:43.578
- OK? Would you just listen for one second?
- Why?

202
00:13:43.796 --> 00:13:45.640
-Why?  So you can give me shit about my clothes?

203
00:13:45.714 --> 00:13:47.755
- No! Look, I'm sorry about that, okay?

204
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.586
I'm sorry, I was an asshole and I didn't mean it.

205
00:13:50.762 --> 00:13:51.823
You know whatever, Teddy.

206
00:13:52.182 --> 00:13:54.717
Tami listen, I love you.

207
00:13:55.632 --> 00:13:58.836
Okay, and I don't want to fight like we've
been doing the past few months.

208
00:13:59.113 --> 00:14:01.381
I don't know Teddy. I mean, something got to change.

209
00:14:01.612 --> 00:14:04.416
You know? Because I can't do this anymore.

210
00:14:04.563 --> 00:14:06.631
- It's too much!
- I know, I know.

211
00:14:07.219 --> 00:14:08.486
And that's why ..

212
00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:11.188
I want to have a baby.

213
00:14:13.508 --> 00:14:15.641
- You do?
- Yeah.

214
00:14:15.846 --> 00:14:18.447
A baby? Like really?

215
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.641
Yeah! I think if we got a kid to love,

216
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.594
he'll teach us to how to love each other again.

217
00:14:23.932 --> 00:14:25.424
Oh my God Teddy.

218
00:14:26.436 --> 00:14:28.982
- You better not be messing with me.
- I swear to God, I'm not mesing with you!

219
00:14:29.007 --> 00:14:32.612
- You'll make an awesome mom!
- Oh my God, are you kidding me?

220
00:14:32.614 --> 00:14:36.418
- I would like kick so much ass at being a mom.
- So what do you say, we all good?

221
00:14:36.422 --> 00:14:39.109
- Yes! I love you, I love you so much!

222
00:14:39.247 --> 00:14:40.856
- Oh baby! I love you too.

223
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.961
- Let's make a baby.
- Let's make a baby.

224
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.747
Okay are you ready?  Here it comes!

225
00:14:55.931 --> 00:14:57.464
Okay, I'm ready.

226
00:15:09.557 --> 00:15:11.895
- I say we go to court.
- Yes, let's go to court.

227
00:15:11.897 --> 00:15:15.103
We are a bunch of assholes who take
up a whole hallwaywithou conversation.

228
00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:19.104
Hey you lawyer guys.

229
00:15:20.184 --> 00:15:22.781
You don't know me and Johnny are watching you.

230
00:15:22.973 --> 00:15:25.239
While we're high.

231
00:15:27.062 --> 00:15:29.398
- That was fucking magic.
- It felt smooth.

232
00:15:29.423 --> 00:15:31.656
- That felt really smooth.
- It's all in the pocket.

233
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.094
Hey, so uh...

234
00:15:33.348 --> 00:15:36.897
- Listen, I got some big news to tell you.
- Oh yeah, what's that?

235
00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:40.677
Tami-Lynn and I are gonna have a baby.

236
00:15:42.828 --> 00:15:45.999
- Holy shit! You?
- Yeah! We talked about it today.

237
00:15:46.024 --> 00:15:47.794
Dude, that's fucking awesome! Congratulations!

238
00:15:48.209 --> 00:15:49.108
Thank You.

239
00:15:49.109 --> 00:15:51.071
Wait, wait, how do you guys...?

240
00:15:51.397 --> 00:15:55.003
Well, that's the thing. We got to find a sperm donor and ...

241
00:15:56.124 --> 00:15:59.930
I'm wondering, what do you think
Sam Jones would say if I asked him?

242
00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:02.001
You want to Flash Gordon to father of your child?

243
00:16:02.002 --> 00:16:05.609
Yeah, I mean do you think that would be weird?
Like would he be freaked out if I...?

244
00:16:05.677 --> 00:16:09.485
No I think he'd be flattered plus the baby
would be a fucking superhero.

245
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.303
Well that was the logic I arrived at aswell.

246
00:16:11.406 --> 00:16:12.562
I say do it.

247
00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.665
Alright I'll shoot him an e-mail right now
and see if I can stop by tonight.

248
00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:17.414
- You'll come with me?
- Sure!

249
00:16:17.448 --> 00:16:18.339
Alright, great.

250
00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:23.347
Shit, I can never get a signal in your apartment.

251
00:16:23.741 --> 00:16:25.561
- Can I use your laptop?
- Yes, go ahead.

252
00:16:25.804 --> 00:16:27.239
Okay, thanks.

253
00:16:31.493 --> 00:16:33.229
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit!

254
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.964
What's the matter? What happened?

255
00:16:35.172 --> 00:16:37.911
- What's going on?
- There is so much porn!

256
00:16:37.912 --> 00:16:40.110
What thehell are you doing looking at my private shit?

257
00:16:40.112 --> 00:16:43.584
What are you talking about
private shit Johnny, it was wide open.

258
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.320
There were literally thousands of files here!

259
00:16:45.322 --> 00:16:46.943
I've been meaning to
clear some of that out.

260
00:16:46.968 --> 00:16:47.592
Jesus Christ.

261
00:16:47.594 --> 00:16:51.465
Look at the organisation here.
Clockwise rimjob, counter clockwise rimjob.

262
00:16:51.871 --> 00:16:54.207
Yeah well, sometimes you want to
see the tongue go the other way.

263
00:16:54.208 --> 00:16:57.279
You sick fuck! Look at this! Chicks with dicks!?

264
00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:01.355
Oh, my God! I have a disease alright? I need help!

265
00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:04.027
There are no chicks with dicks Johnny!
Only guys with tits!

266
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:05.831
Well this is such a relief.
You have to help, I'm

267
00:17:05.856 --> 00:17:07.633
glad I finally got caught.
I wanted to be caught!

268
00:17:07.636 --> 00:17:10.507
Johnny you listen to me, this is a wake up call, okay?

269
00:17:10.643 --> 00:17:12.446
You gotta get back out
there and meet somebody

270
00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:14.272
because you are spiraling
out of control here.

271
00:17:14.383 --> 00:17:16.988
Alright, alright, fine I will,
just stop looking at that shit, please.

272
00:17:17.058 --> 00:17:20.462
Johnny I mean it! Alright, the next chick
you meet you will be back in the game.

273
00:17:20.465 --> 00:17:21.933
- Fine I got it...Done!
- Alright.

274
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:23.488
Now let's get rid of this.

275
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.271
What do you mean? Just delete the files.

276
00:17:25.474 --> 00:17:27.323
No, no. That shit can always be recovered.

277
00:17:27.364 --> 00:17:29.445
We gotta smash your laptop with a hammer.

278
00:17:35.563 --> 00:17:37.633
- Well, are you happy?
- No, the circuits can

279
00:17:37.635 --> 00:17:39.205
be reconstructed if someone worked at it.

280
00:17:39.207 --> 00:17:41.128
We have to bury it in the harbour.

281
00:17:55.737 --> 00:17:59.279
So basically that's it. We need a sperm donor.

282
00:17:59.814 --> 00:18:02.417
So what do you say?
You would really be helping me and Tami out.

283
00:18:02.688 --> 00:18:05.691
- No can do my brother.
- Why not?

284
00:18:06.293 --> 00:18:09.500
I did a lot of blow in the eighties and...

285
00:18:09.702 --> 00:18:12.973
- My sperm count is a little low.
- Well how low?

286
00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:15.778
- One.
- One?

287
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.990
Yeah little fella having his own I am Legend in my nutsack.

288
00:18:19.991 --> 00:18:22.259
- Well, can we have that one?
- No!

289
00:18:22.462 --> 00:18:25.868
It's needed for protein if I ever get lost at sea.

290
00:18:26.004 --> 00:18:28.072
Come on guys. Are we done here? I gotta go.

291
00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:30.744
That sister sister marathon ain't gonna watch itself.

292
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.489
- I can not believe that son of a bitch.
- That was really selfish of him.

293
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.561
I know. And after I watched his pissed
of shit movie like a 100 times.

294
00:18:38.897 --> 00:18:40.498
God dammit!

295
00:18:41.436 --> 00:18:42.971
Oh Shit!

296
00:18:48.183 --> 00:18:50.320
Johnny, please just help me do this, okay?

297
00:18:50.322 --> 00:18:53.393
He's the only guy in the world
whos sperm is even close to Flash Gordons

298
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:55.441
Teddy, it's insane. We can get in a lot of trouble.

299
00:18:55.466 --> 00:18:57.251
Not if no one finds out.

300
00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:59.594
Look, John, we sneak into
his house, jerk him off in

301
00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:02.212
his sleep and sneak out with the sperm.
It'll be easy.

302
00:19:03.132 --> 00:19:04.824
And think how awesome the baby will be!

303
00:19:05.414 --> 00:19:07.022
It would be a sweet ass fucking baby!

304
00:19:08.427 --> 00:19:10.954
Alright I'll help you but we gotta have a game plan.

305
00:19:22.991 --> 00:19:24.660
Just calm down.

306
00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:28.200
Yeah, I can help you?

307
00:19:28.802 --> 00:19:32.141
Hey. You're Tom Brady?

308
00:19:32.478 --> 00:19:36.417
- Yeah.
- Your neighbours called and

309
00:19:36.419 --> 00:19:39.091
your airconditioner makes alot of noice
so I'm supposed to check out the unit.

310
00:19:39.092 --> 00:19:41.494
- Oh okay, yeah it's around the back.
- Okay, I just need ...

311
00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.820
a signature, in case I gotta
get some parts for the building.

312
00:19:45.639 --> 00:19:49.511
If you could just write that to
John and Ted with number twelve.

313
00:19:49.716 --> 00:19:52.919
And you're not a cheater. I think your balls are perfect.

314
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.856
It's around the back.

315
00:20:17.776 --> 00:20:19.242
Stupid fucking idiot!

316
00:20:26.259 --> 00:20:27.727
Okay, go, go, go!

317
00:20:27.751 --> 00:20:31.751
<i>M.R. Sumon</i>

318
00:20:44.363 --> 00:20:46.166
Take the damn raingear off, you're making to much noise.

319
00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:48.237
Piss off! I don't wanna get any jizz on me.

320
00:20:59.397 --> 00:21:02.735
Two league mvps, four super bowl rings.

321
00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:05.742
Guaranteed hall of fame.

322
00:21:05.743 --> 00:21:08.413
Now let's give him a hand job in thes red solo cup.

323
00:21:08.815 --> 00:21:09.605
Alright, go ahead.

324
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.778
What do you mean go ahead?
You gotta do it.

325
00:21:12.624 --> 00:21:14.491
What are you talking about? You're the one who needs sperm.

326
00:21:14.492 --> 00:21:16.271
Yes, but there got to be
a human hand, it gotta

327
00:21:16.296 --> 00:21:18.059
be skin to skin, otherwise
it doesn't work.

328
00:21:18.339 --> 00:21:20.483
- No it doesn't, it's just friction
- Look, I've never done this before.

329
00:21:20.508 --> 00:21:22.110
- Well neither have I!
- You do it to yourself!

330
00:21:22.111 --> 00:21:25.183
- It's different!
- You're an adult

331
00:21:25.184 --> 00:21:27.653
with a poster of this fucking yuy in your room
and you tell me you dont want this?

332
00:21:27.724 --> 00:21:29.721
Yeah I want it. But I'm nervous. What
if he doesnt like the way I'm doing it?

333
00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:31.795
If I want to. But I'm nervous What will
happen if you see what I'm doing to him?

334
00:21:31.797 --> 00:21:34.986
Please hold yourself together! He'll love it! Go, go, go.

335
00:21:40.951 --> 00:21:43.687
Sweet God and baby Jesus

336
00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:48.538
- And that's in rest.
- What the hell?

337
00:21:48.592 --> 00:21:50.210
Mr Brady, we just need
a moment of your time.

338
00:21:50.235 --> 00:21:53.197
What are you doing here? Who are you?
Get out of my house!

339
00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.054
Wait, Mr. Brady.

340
00:21:58.055 --> 00:22:00.389
Take your God damn teddy bear with you!

341
00:22:01.795 --> 00:22:04.131
Holy shit! I hurt my spinal!

342
00:22:04.133 --> 00:22:06.054
Come on, lets get out of here.

343
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.292
What the hell do we do now?

344
00:22:19.231 --> 00:22:21.835
- Ted let me ask you something.
- What's that?

345
00:22:22.611 --> 00:22:23.767
- Why didn't you just come to me?

346
00:22:24.464 --> 00:22:25.509
- What are you talking about?

347
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.047
For the sperm.

348
00:22:27.985 --> 00:22:31.924
Johnny, you kidding me?
You're the first person I wanted to go.

349
00:22:32.528 --> 00:22:36.132
But you've just been so bumped down
with your divorce lately, that I just...

350
00:22:36.736 --> 00:22:38.897
You know, I didn't want to put
you in an awkward position.

351
00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:42.423
Plus, after seeing your laptop
I didn't think you had any left.

352
00:22:42.615 --> 00:22:45.419
Just so you know, I'm
totally willing to do it.

353
00:22:45.444 --> 00:22:46.378
Really?

354
00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:50.364
- You'd do that for me?
- What? Ted, you're my best friend.

355
00:22:50.365 --> 00:22:54.037
I'd do anythng for you. Besides,
we just broke into Tom Bradys house

356
00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:57.633
and tried to jerk him off. You are ready to be a parent.

357
00:22:57.847 --> 00:22:59.381
God!

358
00:22:59.718 --> 00:23:04.726
I do not know what to say. Jonhy thank you!
Thank you so much.

359
00:23:05.128 --> 00:23:07.867
Hey, thunder buddys for life, remember?

360
00:23:08.434 --> 00:23:09.856
- Thunder buddys for life.

361
00:23:10.207 --> 00:23:12.344
- Come on, we gotta get out of
here before the cops show up.

362
00:23:13.079 --> 00:23:17.086
All units, we have a 317 on Maple Drive.
Area units please respond.

363
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.823
What is a 317?

364
00:23:18.892 --> 00:23:21.962
Someone tried to steal Tom Bradys jizz again.

365
00:23:35.339 --> 00:23:37.475
What is that? What are you doing?

366
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.347
- I'm getting ready, dude.
- What do you mean getting ready?

367
00:23:39.349 --> 00:23:40.531
What are you doing
with your hand?

368
00:23:40.556 --> 00:23:42.220
I'm doing this for you,
I'm getting ready ...

369
00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:44.835
You got your hand on your
dick what are you doing?

370
00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.629
I'm trying to get it half hard

371
00:23:46.631 --> 00:23:48.099
so when I get in ther I can just bust it out.

372
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.436
Sitting out here in public and jerking off.

373
00:23:50.438 --> 00:23:51.906
Where do you think you are, Red Lobster?
What are you doing?

374
00:23:51.908 --> 00:23:53.443
- What do you think I'm gonna do in there?
- Forget it.

375
00:23:53.444 --> 00:23:56.382
You have not smoked pot for two whole days right?

376
00:23:56.359 --> 00:23:59.032
Yes I told you I'm clean, alright?
Your baby is gonna be fine.

377
00:23:59.057 --> 00:24:03.464
Alright I'm sorry. I just don't want something
I gotta feed with a pitchfork when he's sixteen.

378
00:24:04.001 --> 00:24:06.069
- John Bennet?
- Hi.

379
00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:08.754
Right this way.
I'll show where to deposit your specimen.

380
00:24:09.546 --> 00:24:11.013
Hey Johnny!

381
00:24:21.372 --> 00:24:25.045
- I'm John Bennet.
- I know, I just said your name.

382
00:24:25.046 --> 00:24:27.315
Alright, yeah. Sorry I'm a little nervous.

383
00:24:27.317 --> 00:24:29.452
I've been out of the game for a while.

384
00:24:29.454 --> 00:24:32.660
- The game?
- Well, I do not talk to pretty girls that often.

385
00:24:32.661 --> 00:24:36.535
- Pretty women, ladies.
- I see.

386
00:24:37.806 --> 00:24:39.927
Hey, when I'm done here, how about a drink?

387
00:24:41.011 --> 00:24:42.013
I do not ...

388
00:24:42.015 --> 00:24:44.150
I don't not mean this. Like a regular drink.

389
00:24:44.152 --> 00:24:46.020
I have a boyfriend.

390
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.163
Yeah, okay. Too bad, you miss another great guy.

391
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:55.308
Do I just spit in my hand or do
I get a lobo or something or a magazine?

392
00:24:55.868 --> 00:24:58.736
- In video I like asian teens.
- There is stuff right there.

393
00:24:59.274 --> 00:25:00.651
Alright thanks..

394
00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:08.269
Excuse me, where's your non jerking off bathroom?

395
00:25:08.793 --> 00:25:10.805
- Down that hallway to the left.
- Okay, thanks.

396
00:25:17.558 --> 00:25:19.290
Oh no way.

397
00:25:20.629 --> 00:25:24.170
Oh hey doc. Is this where
you guys store all your stuff?

398
00:25:24.838 --> 00:25:28.510
Is the intermediate station, before insemination. Are you..

399
00:25:28.975 --> 00:25:32.649
My friend is janking out a sample in one of those rooms.

400
00:25:32.855 --> 00:25:34.122
- It is a good friend.
- Yeah.

401
00:25:34.124 --> 00:25:36.261
- I'm doctor Danzer.
- Oh cool. Hold me closer doctor Danzer.

402
00:25:40.072 --> 00:25:41.540
Yeah whatever, I don't know.

403
00:25:41.542 --> 00:25:44.212
Wait now, you look familiar.
Are you that teddy bear

404
00:25:44.213 --> 00:25:46.441
- who came to life?
- I am, that's me, yeah.

405
00:25:46.484 --> 00:25:49.156
I was trying to figure out where
I had seen you before and that's it.

406
00:25:49.157 --> 00:25:50.357
Good eye, good eye.

407
00:25:50.358 --> 00:25:52.227
So how did you get in to this line of work?

408
00:25:52.229 --> 00:25:54.631
Do you just love cum?

409
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.842
Not especially. But I love helping good people

410
00:25:57.843 --> 00:26:01.783
fulfill their dreams of having children.
It's amazing what we can do here.

411
00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:03.987
You wanna, you wanna have a look?

412
00:26:03.988 --> 00:26:05.591
Yeah sure.

413
00:26:07.397 --> 00:26:10.801
This is where we perform our pre implantation genetic diagnoses.

414
00:26:10.802 --> 00:26:13.205
We can eliminate hereditary diseases such as

415
00:26:13.207 --> 00:26:16.213
cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophies, cycocel anemia.

416
00:26:16.214 --> 00:26:18.616
- The list goes on and on really.
- Wow.

417
00:26:19.957 --> 00:26:22.492
- Hey Johnny you did it!
- Right here buddy.

418
00:26:22.629 --> 00:26:24.629
Euw! I mean, awesome!

419
00:26:25.033 --> 00:26:28.275
Excuse me, doctor, your wife is on the phone.
She says it's an emergency.

420
00:26:28.641 --> 00:26:30.174
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

421
00:26:32.114 --> 00:26:34.385
Do you want to see it huh? Want to see your kid?

422
00:26:34.387 --> 00:26:35.855
I can see it from here. Thanks, yes.

423
00:26:35.856 --> 00:26:40.264
- Take a closer, it's your kid.
- No, no, no it's close enough.

424
00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:43.270
- Catch!
- Oh shit!

425
00:26:43.271 --> 00:26:45.676
- Oh God!
- That's somebodys fucking kid.

426
00:26:45.678 --> 00:26:48.347
It was not my fault, you were supposed to catch it..

427
00:26:48.348 --> 00:26:50.285
- We gotta find something to scope it up.
- There's containers over there.

428
00:26:50.287 --> 00:26:52.423
Let's go for the plate.

429
00:26:52.959 --> 00:26:56.031
Alright, that's not gonna work, you need
two of them to scope one into the other.

430
00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.041
- Of fuck!
- Oh, my fucking God!

431
00:27:01.042 --> 00:27:02.777
Fuck!

432
00:27:07.256 --> 00:27:08.857
- Oh my God, it's in my fucking mouth!
- Hang on!

433
00:27:08.858 --> 00:27:11.730
- I gotta post this on facebook.
- No!

434
00:27:12.334 --> 00:27:14.603
Hashtag, grrr mondays.

435
00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:18.213
- Oh, my God!
- Look I'm so sorry!

436
00:27:18.214 --> 00:27:20.751
We're so sorry.

437
00:27:20.753 --> 00:27:23.890
Well I guess it's alright.
Those are the rejected cycocell samples.

438
00:27:23.891 --> 00:27:27.431
You hear that Johnny?
You are covered in rejected black guys sperm.

439
00:27:27.499 --> 00:27:29.234
- You look like a Kardashian.
- Fuck.

440
00:27:42.663 --> 00:27:46.539
No, make sure you have all the updated
information about our comic con placement.

441
00:27:46.541 --> 00:27:49.946
This has to be the biggest, most
impressive roll out of the convention.

442
00:27:49.947 --> 00:27:51.548
Good morning, mr. Jessup.

443
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:52.750
Good morning.

444
00:27:52.751 --> 00:27:54.887
My name is Donnie.

445
00:27:55.826 --> 00:27:57.359
- Hi, Donnie
- Hi.

446
00:27:57.429 --> 00:28:00.101
This is a multiplatform release. So I want a full report.

447
00:28:00.102 --> 00:28:01.769
Fresh cakes.

448
00:28:03.643 --> 00:28:05.845
- What?
- In the urinal sir.

449
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:10.454
I notice you always use urinal force
so I put fresh cakes in there for you

450
00:28:10.659 --> 00:28:13.728
You are an important man,
you should never have to smell pee.

451
00:28:14.331 --> 00:28:19.273
See, most people flip the cakes.
I replae the cakes.

452
00:28:20.345 --> 00:28:21.986
That's the difference Donnie.

453
00:28:24.688 --> 00:28:27.624
I need a full report on all the
placements of all our merchandise.

454
00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:33.556
I'm afraid I have bad news.

455
00:28:33.774 --> 00:28:36.055
I won't be able to perform the implantation procedure.

456
00:28:36.446 --> 00:28:38.181
- Wait what?
- Why not?

457
00:28:38.518 --> 00:28:42.858
According to your test results
you are no longer fertile.

458
00:28:42.925 --> 00:28:45.460
- What?
- Wait, doctor. are you sure about that?

459
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.137
- Maybe you should check again.
- I'm quite sure.

460
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.214
Tami-Lynn, because of your
history of excessive drug use

461
00:28:53.215 --> 00:28:56.688
your ovarian canal has
been somewhat compromised.

462
00:28:56.824 --> 00:28:59.025
- What are you talking about? It looks fine.
- Yeah!

463
00:28:59.761 --> 00:29:03.366
Forgive me, that's a normal ovary.
This is Tami-Lynns.

464
00:29:03.903 --> 00:29:07.175
- Jesus!
- Yes, but I bet this stuff happens alot.

465
00:29:07.177 --> 00:29:09.780
I mean, you probably see
this kind of stuff all the time, right?

466
00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.986
No. Not once.
Not ever.

467
00:29:12.255 --> 00:29:15.328
When I saw this I threw up.  I almost quite medicine.

468
00:29:15.729 --> 00:29:18.531
Bottom line is insemination isn't possible.

469
00:29:19.003 --> 00:29:22.274
I don't understand. None of this makes any sense.

470
00:29:22.275 --> 00:29:24.082
It's OK darling. Come on, let's just go.

471
00:29:24.084 --> 00:29:27.150
What does it mean?
Does this mean we can't have a baby?

472
00:29:27.151 --> 00:29:30.158
I do not know but it's gonna be okay.
Everything is gonna be okay.

473
00:29:30.427 --> 00:29:31.961
It really isn't.

474
00:29:44.123 --> 00:29:48.597
Well, I've gone through your application
and vetted your personal history

475
00:29:49.668 --> 00:29:51.804
and I'm afraid this isn't going to work out.

476
00:29:52.807 --> 00:29:54.875
- What?
- Why not?

477
00:29:55.012 --> 00:29:58.617
Well, first of all there is a question
of Tami-Lynns drug conviction.

478
00:29:58.686 --> 00:30:00.488
Hey, I did my community service.

479
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.294
Yeah, and besides, that was
five years ago. She's clean.

480
00:30:03.965 --> 00:30:09.442
There's another issue and honestly it's the more
serious one. I was reluctant to bring it up because...

481
00:30:11.914 --> 00:30:13.448
It is a little awkward.

482
00:30:14.186 --> 00:30:18.126
Ted, in the eyes of the state you are not a person.

483
00:30:19.463 --> 00:30:21.332
Wait, what?

484
00:30:22.203 --> 00:30:27.547
The state official I spoke to said that
technically you are classified as property.

485
00:30:29.819 --> 00:30:32.287
I'm not a person?

486
00:30:32.625 --> 00:30:35.563
Not according to the government. I'm sorry.

487
00:30:35.564 --> 00:30:37.367
But that is so fucked up!

488
00:30:37.903 --> 00:30:41.376
- Property? -
You know that Teddy, let's get out of here.

489
00:30:41.645 --> 00:30:44.383
Come on.

490
00:30:44.384 --> 00:30:48.323
Look. You seem like good people. Be careful.

491
00:30:49.262 --> 00:30:50.997
What do you mean be careful?

492
00:30:50.998 --> 00:30:56.942
The state official I spoke to made it sound like
your status has gone under the radar for some time.

493
00:30:57.144 --> 00:31:00.351
Your adoption request may have raised some red flags.

494
00:31:00.352 --> 00:31:05.894
If they choose to investigate the issue
it may leave you quite vulnerable.

495
00:31:19.126 --> 00:31:23.332
Hey, I just got of work and heard your message.
Is that for real? Did they actually tell you that?

496
00:31:23.334 --> 00:31:24.669
Yeah, it's unbelievable.

497
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:27.005
They say I'm property.

498
00:31:27.075 --> 00:31:29.077
What does that even mean?

499
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.148
That you are a thing?
Like garbage or a piece of shit?

500
00:31:31.283 --> 00:31:34.824
Well, maybe more like a hammer or an orange, but yeah.

501
00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:37.280
What the hell do they know?
It's just a word. Do not

502
00:31:37.282 --> 00:31:39.968
They can't change a life just by calling it property.

503
00:31:39.968 --> 00:31:42.906
Bullshit! Better ask my ancestors.

504
00:31:42.974 --> 00:31:47.115
One minute you're in Africa washing your
clothes in the river with titties out, you're good.

505
00:31:47.117 --> 00:31:50.856
Then all of the sudden, you somewhere
across the world fucking Thomas Jefferson.

506
00:31:51.258 --> 00:31:53.863
Wow, you make history come alive.

507
00:31:54.199 --> 00:31:55.799
Why the hell is this comming up now?

508
00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.610
Well, I've never voted, I don't have a
drivers licence, I don't pay taxes.

509
00:32:00.612 --> 00:32:03.015
Hell, this is the first job I ever had.

510
00:32:04.288 --> 00:32:06.489
Ted. Can I see you for a moment?

511
00:32:08.362 --> 00:32:10.764
I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to let you go.

512
00:32:10.766 --> 00:32:11.966
What?

513
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.243
Why? I've been busting my ass
of on this job for three years.

514
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:17.953
I just got a call from the labour department.

515
00:32:18.449 --> 00:32:22.524
I can't legally keep you as an emplyee
because I've been informed that you're technically

516
00:32:22.525 --> 00:32:25.263
Technically not a person. Yeah, Jesus Christ!

517
00:32:26.533 --> 00:32:30.074
I'm sorry but as of today you're fired.

518
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:38.024
Dear Ted, your Chase bank account
has been terminated due to lack of citizenship.

519
00:32:38.025 --> 00:32:40.763
Dear Ted, your Discover card has been revoked.

520
00:32:40.764 --> 00:32:45.372
Dear Ted, you are no longer a
Papa Chinoawards member. Fuck, that's a big one.

521
00:32:45.777 --> 00:32:47.510
This poor baby booty.

522
00:32:48.046 --> 00:32:52.052
It's always gonna be empty.
There's never gonna be a little foot in here.

523
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:54.992
I don't understand. We would've made such great parents.

524
00:32:56.799 --> 00:32:58.267
Oh my God!

525
00:32:58.468 --> 00:33:00.671
- Oh my God, Teddy.
- Woo, woo what's wrong?

526
00:33:00.673 --> 00:33:02.140
Look at this.

527
00:33:02.345 --> 00:33:07.085
Dear Ted, the state of Masachusetts regrets
to inform you that due to an oversight

528
00:33:07.087 --> 00:33:09.891
regarding your legal status

529
00:33:10.226 --> 00:33:14.633
your marriage to Tami-Lynn McCafferty
is unrecognized by the state

530
00:33:14.771 --> 00:33:18.176
and therefore invalid and hereby annulled.

531
00:33:18.243 --> 00:33:21.583
- Teddy, can they do this to us?
- Let me see that.

532
00:33:24.857 --> 00:33:26.392
This is a nightmare!

533
00:33:29.936 --> 00:33:32.874
- You fucking believe that?
- No, this is insane.

534
00:33:33.276 --> 00:33:35.011
Tami is the woman I love.

535
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.886
I would never even have tried to adopt a
dog If I had known that it was gonna cause

536
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:41.824
- me this kind of shitstorm.
- This whole thing is comple bullshit.

537
00:33:41.826 --> 00:33:44.029
If you ask me we gotta fight it.

538
00:33:44.031 --> 00:33:46.501
- What do you mean?
- I mean we get a lawyer.

539
00:33:46.838 --> 00:33:48.908
- Oh my God, can we do that?
- Hell yeah!

540
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:52.650
You know what we do? We get a lawyer and sue
the fucking government for your civil rights.

541
00:33:52.651 --> 00:33:54.584
Johnny, that's a great idea.

542
00:33:54.586 --> 00:33:56.656
Maybe we can get one of them Harrison Ford lawyers,

543
00:33:56.658 --> 00:34:00.532
who get shot in the head and turns around
all retired and says "What we're doing is wrong".

544
00:34:00.533 --> 00:34:04.607
Yes. We go out there and stick it to them good!
We take that shit all the way up to Judge Judy if we have to.

545
00:34:05.945 --> 00:34:08.817
But we do not know any lawyer.
All our friends make sandwishes.

546
00:34:08.818 --> 00:34:10.819
We just google Boston lawyers.

547
00:34:12.425 --> 00:34:14.827
Jesus, look at that black cock.

548
00:34:36.543 --> 00:34:38.880
This is a very complicated case you have here.

549
00:34:39.683 --> 00:34:44.292
Most civil rights cases are,
but this one has some very obvious wrinkles.

550
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.562
Well everybody says you're the best in town.

551
00:34:46.764 --> 00:34:50.037
Listen, your case is not gonna be cheap.

552
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.573
What is your financial situation?

553
00:34:52.642 --> 00:34:55.717
All of our holdings are tied up in the railroad.

554
00:34:55.785 --> 00:34:58.388
Yeah, Raiding Railroad, B.O
Railroad, Pennsylvanian Railroad.

555
00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:03.100
We're working on short line, I own atlantic avenue.

556
00:35:03.103 --> 00:35:04.800
And I have 4 houses on Baltic Ave.
I'm thinking about just tear them down and build a hotel.

557
00:35:04.803 --> 00:35:07.943
I won second prize at a beauty contest, thats $50 right there.

558
00:35:07.944 --> 00:35:10.012
Are you guys just saying monolpoy stuff?

559
00:35:10.014 --> 00:35:13.020
I'm gonna drive around the block and I'll be back with $200.

560
00:35:13.021 --> 00:35:14.689
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

561
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:19.967
My niece has just passed the bar exam, and I
hired her on as junior associate here with the firm.

562
00:35:20.103 --> 00:35:23.107
I can assign her to your case pro-bono.

563
00:35:23.177 --> 00:35:28.050
Then you would get a hungry young attorney
and I would get a more experienced lawyer in return.

564
00:35:28.588 --> 00:35:29.922
So what do you say to that?

565
00:35:29.923 --> 00:35:31.991
Yeah, sure, it sounds great.

566
00:35:32.795 --> 00:35:35.266
Are those high candies just to take?

567
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:37.738
Those arn't supposed to be out.

568
00:35:48.498 --> 00:35:50.365
Hello?

569
00:35:50.366 --> 00:35:51.967
Fuck!

570
00:35:52.905 --> 00:35:54.507
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

571
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.914
Yeah, Im fine.
You must be Ted.

572
00:35:57.915 --> 00:36:01.188
- Yes, I'm Ted, this is my buddy John.
- Hi!

573
00:36:01.189 --> 00:36:04.796
My uncle says that you guys are my first clients.

574
00:36:04.865 --> 00:36:07.669
Well yeah, it's been discussed but, uh...

575
00:36:08.406 --> 00:36:11.878
- Do you mind if I ask how old you are?
- I'm 26 years.

576
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:14.950
What, is that a problem?

577
00:36:14.952 --> 00:36:18.760
I just dont want my lawyer singing
frozen songs during an open argument.

578
00:36:18.761 --> 00:36:22.968
This is just a really important case. Ted has already
lost his job and his marriage has been annulled.

579
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.439
I know. My uncle gave me all the details.

580
00:36:25.441 --> 00:36:29.516
Right, you see, the thing is we dont wanna take
any chances because the stakes are so significant.

581
00:36:29.517 --> 00:36:32.186
We can't just rush into anything.
We gotta make sure we do the right decision.

582
00:36:32.187 --> 00:36:34.618
We really appreciate your time, but I think
what we're probably gonna do is just...

583
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.398
take a seat and get to work.

584
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.735
- We trust you completely.
- Yeah we really feel you got a lot to offer.

585
00:36:42.277 --> 00:36:45.148
Sorry. You dont mind the pot do you?
I get migraines.

586
00:36:45.149 --> 00:36:46.553
Yeah absolutely, me to.

587
00:36:46.555 --> 00:36:49.557
I'm gonna get a huge migraine in
the parking lot in about 20 minutes.

588
00:36:49.692 --> 00:36:51.628
Oh, I'm Samantha Jackson.

589
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.966
- Ted, How are you?
- Good to meet you, John.

590
00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:58.242
- Wait, what is your middle name?
- Leslie.

591
00:36:58.243 --> 00:37:01.316
Oh my God! So you are Sam L Jackson?

592
00:37:01.317 --> 00:37:03.320
That's fucking great, just like Samuel L Jackson!

593
00:37:03.322 --> 00:37:06.393
- Who is that?
- Have you seen any a movie ever?

594
00:37:06.394 --> 00:37:08.128
He's the black guy.

595
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.072
The weed is really good.

596
00:37:12.074 --> 00:37:15.013
It reminds me of the train I smoked
last summer called here comes autism

597
00:37:15.014 --> 00:37:19.555
Yeah I was just gonna say it's sorta like this other badge
we had called how long has that van been there?

598
00:37:19.556 --> 00:37:22.828
No it's a new stream that my dealer
gave me called help me get home.

599
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.633
I am surprised that a lawyer like you gets high.

600
00:37:25.635 --> 00:37:28.307
Are not you supposed to be fighting
the war against drugs and all that shit?

601
00:37:28.308 --> 00:37:30.512
Please, the war on drugs is a joke.

602
00:37:30.514 --> 00:37:32.784
It's just a way for the government to
inflate lawenforcement budgets

603
00:37:32.786 --> 00:37:35.923
and lock up minorities for no good reason.

604
00:37:35.924 --> 00:37:38.798
And you, my friend, are an oppressed minority.

605
00:37:38.799 --> 00:37:40.667
Yeah, no shit.

606
00:37:40.669 --> 00:37:44.006
They deny you the same rights as
everybody else just because you're different.

607
00:37:44.007 --> 00:37:46.680
And I say that's a violation of the constitution.

608
00:37:47.015 --> 00:37:49.417
So what do you say? Can you get me my life back?

609
00:37:52.828 --> 00:37:54.428
I'm gonna try.

610
00:37:55.166 --> 00:37:58.637
Guys, I'm having some troubles over here.

611
00:37:58.841 --> 00:38:01.110
What's the matter?

612
00:38:01.111 --> 00:38:02.871
Can you help me get home?

613
00:38:03.917 --> 00:38:08.124
- I'm having a real hard time!
- It's okay, buddy. You are right.

614
00:38:08.126 --> 00:38:11.799
- I'm scared!
- It's okay, it's okay.

615
00:38:11.802 --> 00:38:13.602
You just have to hang on to the wall.

616
00:38:14.741 --> 00:38:16.142
Someone is going to get me!

617
00:38:16.143 --> 00:38:18.077
How far away do you live?

618
00:38:18.547 --> 00:38:20.217
About a mile and a half.

619
00:38:20.218 --> 00:38:24.055
Hey, it's okey.

620
00:38:33.779 --> 00:38:38.856
Alright, I got Dred Scott vs Sandford,
Plessy vs Ferguson and Brown vs board of education

621
00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:43.467
I got Kramer vs. Kramer, Alien vs Predator,
and Freddy vs Jason.

622
00:38:43.469 --> 00:38:46.540
I got the Ernest goes to camp,
Ernest goes to jail and...

623
00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:49.814
The importance of being Earnest,
which was very disappointing.

624
00:39:11.459 --> 00:39:13.395
Okay, I'll ask you some test
questions, are you ready?

625
00:39:13.397 --> 00:39:14.466
Yep, bring it on.

626
00:39:14.468 --> 00:39:18.608
You're on the stand, the D.A says:
Ted, do you consider yourself to be human?

627
00:39:18.609 --> 00:39:19.745
- Objection.
- Sustained.

628
00:39:19.747 --> 00:39:21.214
No, the witness can't object.

629
00:39:21.215 --> 00:39:22.883
- Overruled? Guilty, so it is.
- Speculation.

630
00:39:22.885 --> 00:39:25.023
List of payments. Come here. Briefcase. My chambers.

631
00:39:25.025 --> 00:39:26.691
- Stop beaver on the witness.
- I rest.

632
00:39:26.692 --> 00:39:28.426
We can totally be lawyers.

633
00:41:01.895 --> 00:41:05.969
Your name is Toby.
You're going to learn to say your name.

634
00:41:06.171 --> 00:41:08.406
Let me hear you say it.

635
00:41:08.642 --> 00:41:11.180
What's your name?

636
00:41:11.182 --> 00:41:13.517
Kunta. Kunta Kinte.

637
00:41:14.187 --> 00:41:16.990
It's just like me.
That's exctly what I'm going through.

638
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:18.929
Well, it''s a little different.

639
00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:23.004
You know Ted, if you legally becomes a person,
you're gonna need a name last name.

640
00:41:23.409 --> 00:41:24.874
Oh yeah you're right.

641
00:41:25.212 --> 00:41:26.611
Okay...I got one.

642
00:41:26.612 --> 00:41:27.681
Okay what is it?

643
00:41:27.683 --> 00:41:29.552
Clubberlang.

644
00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:31.154
Who is Clubberlang?

645
00:41:31.357 --> 00:41:34.280
- Who is Clubberlang?
- The character of Mr. T, in Rocky 3.

646
00:41:34.897 --> 00:41:36.285
Is that from boxing movies?

647
00:41:36.287 --> 00:41:39.040
The boxing movies? You've never seen Rocky?

648
00:41:39.041 --> 00:41:41.444
You've never seen Rocky? You know ...

649
00:41:45.623 --> 00:41:46.673
You know, Rocky!

650
00:41:46.674 --> 00:41:50.397
I'm not gonna remember a movie I havn't seen just
because you're singing a song I don't know.

651
00:41:50.398 --> 00:41:54.805
You do not know Samuel L. Jackson.
You don't know Rocky.. You are literally pop culture.

652
00:41:54.807 --> 00:41:58.815
I have a college degree, my popcultur references
are Hamlet and Achilles and Dorian Gray.

653
00:41:58.817 --> 00:42:00.286
Never heard of any of them?

654
00:42:00.287 --> 00:42:02.821
No, but I'm pretty sure Mister T could kick their ass.

655
00:42:02.823 --> 00:42:05.562
- Yeah, you really need to be educated.
- Oh really?

656
00:42:06.365 --> 00:42:09.303
Can either of you tell me who
wrote The Great Gatsby?

657
00:42:09.573 --> 00:42:10.707
- Judy Vaughn?
- Hitler?

658
00:42:10.708 --> 00:42:11.975
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

659
00:42:11.977 --> 00:42:13.445
Who's that?

660
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:14.647
The author.

661
00:42:14.649 --> 00:42:16.519
- Why are you saying fuck him?
- What?

662
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.192
You just said F Scott Fitzgerald,
what did Scott Fizgerald ever do to you?

663
00:42:20.194 --> 00:42:22.131
No, that's his first name.

664
00:42:22.133 --> 00:42:25.137
. His name is Fuck Scott Fitzgerald?
- What? No!

665
00:42:25.138 --> 00:42:27.408
- Then what does the F stands for?
- Francis!

666
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.750
- No, it gotta be fuck.
- It must be.

667
00:42:30.751 --> 00:42:32.021
Why the hell would it be Fuck?

668
00:42:32.022 --> 00:42:35.426
- Because otherwise, why wouldn't he just say it?
- Yeah, he is hiding something. It's Fuck.

669
00:42:35.428 --> 00:42:37.229
- Read between the lines.
- It's fucked.

670
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.366
This is completely insane.
You guys are idiots.

671
00:42:39.368 --> 00:42:42.439
Yeah, well, whatever.
Ted Cubberlang, get used to it.

672
00:42:48.456 --> 00:42:49.922
Yes?

673
00:42:53.332 --> 00:42:55.800
Sir? One of the janitors would like to see you.

674
00:42:56.005 --> 00:42:57.470
I'm busy.

675
00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:59.142
Fresh cakes.

676
00:43:00.012 --> 00:43:01.213
What is it Danny?

677
00:43:01.215 --> 00:43:04.288
- Donny sir.
- Well Donny, I'm extremely busy

678
00:43:04.289 --> 00:43:05.958
with the comic con presentation

679
00:43:05.959 --> 00:43:10.966
I'm told you have an open door policy here at Hasbro
for new toy ideas from any and all employees.

680
00:43:12.038 --> 00:43:13.771
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

681
00:43:15.044 --> 00:43:16.512
Alright, come in.

682
00:43:16.515 --> 00:43:20.654
Okay. Thank you, I love your dress.

683
00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:30.741
Mr. Jessup I make this company a billion dollars.

684
00:43:31.011 --> 00:43:32.479
I'm listening...

685
00:43:33.284 --> 00:43:38.827
30 years ago a little boy named John Bennett
made a wish that his teddy bear would come to life.

686
00:43:39.296 --> 00:43:43.101
- Somehow, one of our Hasbro...
- Yes, I know the story.

687
00:43:45.441 --> 00:43:47.410
Have you seen this?

688
00:43:52.123 --> 00:43:53.791
So what?

689
00:43:53.793 --> 00:43:56.599
Well, Ted is suing for his civil rights.

690
00:43:56.601 --> 00:44:02.612
If he loses, the state will officially declare him
a non entity with no rights under the law.

691
00:44:03.245 --> 00:44:07.166
That means he becomes property.
Mr Jessup.

692
00:44:07.622 --> 00:44:13.367
We can take him back with only a trivial degree
of legal consequenses, if we were even caught.

693
00:44:13.569 --> 00:44:15.371
And why would we do this?

694
00:44:15.372 --> 00:44:20.114
Sir, if we can cut him open to see what makes him tick

695
00:44:20.116 --> 00:44:24.926
we can manufacture millions of Teds
for every child in the world.

696
00:44:24.928 --> 00:44:26.995
Hasbro will double it's profits over night.

697
00:44:28.467 --> 00:44:29.668
Go on.

698
00:44:29.669 --> 00:44:32.139
We just have to make sure that Ted loses the case.

699
00:44:32.141 --> 00:44:36.616
You use every back channel, every bribe,
you call in every favour

700
00:44:36.618 --> 00:44:41.223
and you get the best lawyer
in the world on defence.

701
00:44:41.828 --> 00:44:47.905
When Teds rights are officially nulled,
we grab him!

702
00:44:49.112 --> 00:44:51.982
No one's gonna kick up a legal fuss over property.

703
00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:57.993
- You are hell of a lot smarter than your urinal case Danny.
-  Really?

704
00:44:57.995 --> 00:45:03.539
- Now what exactly do you want from this?
- Mr Jessup, I'm not interested in money.

705
00:45:06.213 --> 00:45:08.615
I just want a Ted of my very own.

706
00:45:09.755 --> 00:45:12.492
Alright. I think I can handle the defense.

707
00:45:13.828 --> 00:45:15.697
But let's make one thing clear.

708
00:45:15.699 --> 00:45:21.043
We never had this conversation. Goldner and the
board cannot know about this until we have him.

709
00:45:21.379 --> 00:45:23.783
- Do you understand?
- Yes I do.

710
00:45:27.793 --> 00:45:30.396
I need shep wild.

711
00:45:33.304 --> 00:45:35.338
That was such a good dinner.

712
00:45:35.341 --> 00:45:37.211
I've never had pringles on my steak before.

713
00:45:37.346 --> 00:45:41.019
It's my pleasure. Imean, it's the least
I can do with all you do for us, really.

714
00:45:41.956 --> 00:45:43.958
Well I havn't done anything yet.

715
00:45:44.295 --> 00:45:46.295
We wanted to take you out to dinner, but ..

716
00:45:46.701 --> 00:45:50.039
we only got Tamis income now
since no one will hire me.

717
00:45:50.105 --> 00:45:51.642
Things are getting really tight huh?

718
00:45:51.644 --> 00:45:53.913
Yeah, i've had to do things I'm not proud of.

719
00:45:53.915 --> 00:45:59.794
Bj:s here, hot bj:s just $3.

720
00:45:59.795 --> 00:46:02.866
Bj:s here.

721
00:46:03.868 --> 00:46:07.276
Hey listen, I got an idea. Tami, what do
you say me and you go and do the dishes?

722
00:46:07.277 --> 00:46:10.147
And give Sam and Diane here some alone time?

723
00:46:10.951 --> 00:46:12.753
Alright, alright.

724
00:46:13.088 --> 00:46:15.157
Hey you pulled that bed back bitch.

725
00:46:17.033 --> 00:46:18.041
What do you think that was about?

726
00:46:18.042 --> 00:46:21.904
It's nothing. It's his way of saying
that I should ask you out.

727
00:46:23.975 --> 00:46:25.447
- Look ...
- We should propbably focus our attention to the case.

728
00:46:26.449 --> 00:46:28.250
I completely agree.

729
00:46:29.356 --> 00:46:32.594
You know, I am a little bit curious.
How is it that a guy like you isn't attached?

730
00:46:34.733 --> 00:46:38.074
Well, I was married.
It just didn't work out.

731
00:46:38.342 --> 00:46:41.147
- Shit, I'm sorry. That sucks.
- No.

732
00:46:41.749 --> 00:46:47.294
We made it work day by day but she was
just trying to change me into something I'm not.

733
00:46:47.897 --> 00:46:49.364
And I tried, you know.

734
00:46:50.101 --> 00:46:52.905
I tried everything I could to be
the man that she wanted.

735
00:46:54.376 --> 00:46:57.447
One day I woke up and just realized
I wasn't myself anymore.

736
00:46:58.652 --> 00:47:02.392
You know, as much as I loved this person,
we were completely wrong for eachother.

737
00:47:03.598 --> 00:47:05.398
At least you figured it out early.

738
00:47:05.934 --> 00:47:09.339
Some people tgo through their whole lives
trying to make it work with the wrong person.

739
00:47:12.482 --> 00:47:14.016
So...are we gonna win this thing?

740
00:47:14.484 --> 00:47:16.021
Honestly, I don't know.

741
00:47:16.757 --> 00:47:18.159
We're betting on you.

742
00:47:18.895 --> 00:47:21.498
Johnny, come on, it's almost seven o'clock.
We gotta get up there.

743
00:47:21.501 --> 00:47:23.169
Hey Sam, do you want in on this?

744
00:47:23.305 --> 00:47:24.640
- What is it?
- Oh on Tuesday night we get fucked up

745
00:47:24.642 --> 00:47:26.576
and threw apples at joggers.

746
00:47:31.321 --> 00:47:33.992
Oh, there's one.

747
00:47:33.993 --> 00:47:36.597
- Hey! How's the workout?
- Fuck you!

748
00:47:36.599 --> 00:47:40.406
- What the hell is your problem?
- Take an apple.

749
00:47:40.408 --> 00:47:45.617
You sons of bitches.

750
00:47:48.624 --> 00:47:53.499
- That's the lottery, that's the lottery!
- That's what you get for fucking exercising.

751
00:48:29.712 --> 00:48:31.113
Teddy?

752
00:48:32.117 --> 00:48:34.988
- Teddy, I'm scared.
- Baby, we're gonna be fine.

753
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:38.464
I don't care what any fucking
piece of paper says, you are my wife.

754
00:48:38.904 --> 00:48:40.506
I love you so much!

755
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:43.674
And I swear to God that if we lose
I'm gonna fucking cut that judge.

756
00:48:43.675 --> 00:48:45.411
Wait a minute, did you brought your switchblade?

757
00:48:45.413 --> 00:48:47.816
- Yeah.
- But they padded os down on the way in.

758
00:48:47.818 --> 00:48:51.720
Where did you even hide it?

759
00:48:51.893 --> 00:48:53.227
Hey Sam!

760
00:48:53.229 --> 00:48:55.096
Who's that butthole over there?

761
00:48:57.371 --> 00:49:02.311
That's why we have been working so hard.
That's Shep Wild. It's our bad luck they put him on the trial.

762
00:49:02.917 --> 00:49:05.252
He's never lost a case in his life.

763
00:49:05.321 --> 00:49:08.327
Mr. Wild, your opening
statement if you will please.

764
00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:10.932
Thank you your honor.

765
00:49:11.802 --> 00:49:14.684
I would first like to thank the ladies
and gentlemen of the jury

766
00:49:15.007 --> 00:49:17.476
for taking time from their busy schedules,

767
00:49:17.814 --> 00:49:19.817
to be a part of this proceding.

768
00:49:20.354 --> 00:49:28.678
Now, the case we're examining today really
is quite a simple one. Is Ted a human being?

769
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:30.775
Or a piece of property?

770
00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:37.385
You know? It really is a very special,
very unique thing to be human.

771
00:49:37.925 --> 00:49:41.529
It is a gift from God, bestowed
upon only one species...

772
00:49:41.865 --> 00:49:43.668
Us.

773
00:49:43.737 --> 00:49:47.341
But if we suddenly decide to share that gift,
where does that lead us?

774
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:51.951
Does your dog deserve human rights?

775
00:49:51.953 --> 00:49:53.421
Your cat?

776
00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:55.225
Your toaster?

777
00:49:57.899 --> 00:50:03.238
Suddenly being human doesn't
seem so special anymore, does it?

778
00:50:03.243 --> 00:50:05.511
I'm confident you'll make the right decision.

779
00:50:06.185 --> 00:50:08.988
Thank you Mr. Wild, for your opening statement.

780
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:10.924
Miss Jackson ...

781
00:50:16.272 --> 00:50:17.939
Hi!

782
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:22.751
I'm Samantha Jackson,
and I gotta be honest with you.

783
00:50:23.888 --> 00:50:25.821
I'm a little nervous ...

784
00:50:26.427 --> 00:50:28.093
Why am I nervous?

785
00:50:29.032 --> 00:50:32.268
Well not because I'm a junior
atterny arguing her first case.

786
00:50:33.375 --> 00:50:37.049
And not because some of you might laugh
at the fact that I'm representing a teddy bear.

787
00:50:40.256 --> 00:50:45.198
No, I'm nervous
because of one simple word.

788
00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:48.939
Justice.

789
00:50:49.475 --> 00:50:55.486
I'm nervous that you're going
to be swaved by smooth talk

790
00:50:56.091 --> 00:51:02.020
and a haircut and forget about
the most important aspect to this case.

791
00:51:02.837 --> 00:51:04.973
Justice!

792
00:51:05.912 --> 00:51:09.405
150 years ago, a slave by the name Dred Scott

793
00:51:09.603 --> 00:51:12.900
sued to prove he was a person and not a piece of property

794
00:51:13.629 --> 00:51:15.296
He lost.

795
00:51:15.832 --> 00:51:19.438
And as history has shown us, that wasn't justice.

796
00:51:21.577 --> 00:51:24.516
In every civil rights conflict we are only able to

797
00:51:24.986 --> 00:51:31.531
recognize the just point of view
years after the facts.

798
00:51:31.601 --> 00:51:37.542
And when the next conflict comes along,
we are once again blind to it as it's happening.

799
00:51:37.813 --> 00:51:41.554
Well, this is different, but it isn't.

800
00:51:42.491 --> 00:51:47.699
It's the same beast with different face,
cand it's happening again today.

801
00:51:48.973 --> 00:51:55.585
So I urge you ladies and gentlemen of the jury
to not be a foot note on the wrong side of history.

802
00:51:58.059 --> 00:52:00.529
Don't wait to long to be right.

803
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.336
Thank You.

804
00:52:06.947 --> 00:52:09.483
- Erection.
- Sustained.

805
00:52:12.491 --> 00:52:16.229
Miss McCafferty, you and Ted recently
considered adopting a child, is that correct?

806
00:52:16.232 --> 00:52:18.434
Yeah.

807
00:52:18.436 --> 00:52:21.777
And if I may inquire, why did you not
choose to have a child of your own?

808
00:52:22.646 --> 00:52:24.582
Cause Teddy aint got no dick.

809
00:52:29.062 --> 00:52:32.264
And why does Ted not posess a...

810
00:52:32.803 --> 00:52:35.741
Male appendix? Is it a freak of genetics?

811
00:52:35.809 --> 00:52:39.282
No asshole, he aint got a dick cause
he's a fucking toy. So what's your excuse?

812
00:52:39.952 --> 00:52:41.220
Take a burn!

813
00:52:41.222 --> 00:52:43.544
Yeah how does your tongue taste in your own ass Poindexter.

814
00:52:43.826 --> 00:52:45.228
Yes! What?

815
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:47.166
Order!

816
00:52:48.169 --> 00:52:49.637
Mr Bennet?

817
00:52:49.705 --> 00:52:53.179
How would you categorize your relationship with Ted?

818
00:52:53.781 --> 00:52:55.518
He's my best friend!

819
00:52:55.651 --> 00:52:59.192
- So you don't see him as your property?
- He's not my property.

820
00:52:59.262 --> 00:53:04.538
He's a person. He's way more person than alot
of other people. I mean, fucking Steven Tayla?

821
00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:07.077
What the fuck is that? Some kind of
weird soccermom looking goonie monster?

822
00:53:07.278 --> 00:53:09.214
- Your honor!
- I'll allow it.

823
00:53:09.284 --> 00:53:13.185
Thank you, Your Honor.
Your witness.

824
00:53:16.098 --> 00:53:18.098
Mr Bennet?

825
00:53:18.234 --> 00:53:20.639
When and where did you first encounter Ted?

826
00:53:21.041 --> 00:53:23.924
What do you mean?
My parents got him for me when I was a kid.

827
00:53:24.516 --> 00:53:26.451
Aha, they got him.

828
00:53:27.122 --> 00:53:29.123
Where did they get him?

829
00:53:31.399 --> 00:53:33.401
From a toy store.

830
00:53:33.403 --> 00:53:36.148
-Im sorry, I couldn't here that. Can you repeat?
- From a toy store. You fucking heard me!

831
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:37.810
There's no need for hostility, Mr. Bennet.

832
00:53:37.811 --> 00:53:40.350
Why? Nobody here likes you?
I saw you eat lunch alone. You're a loser!

833
00:53:40.352 --> 00:53:41.753
Your honor?

834
00:53:41.754 --> 00:53:43.690
- Mr Bennett!
- I hope that your kids get bird flu.

835
00:53:43.692 --> 00:53:45.829
- Mr. Benett!
- I'm sorry!

836
00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:49.304
Now, you said your parents purchased Ted.

837
00:53:49.306 --> 00:53:52.911
As one might purchase a baseboll glove or a big wheel.

838
00:53:52.912 --> 00:53:54.780
- It's not like that!
- Objection!

839
00:53:54.784 --> 00:53:57.722
- You can't do that.
- You know what? This is bullshit!

840
00:53:57.724 --> 00:54:00.997
This guy is telling me
I'm not as good as other people.

841
00:54:00.998 --> 00:54:03.402
And that's exactly what you've been doing to the fags.

842
00:54:03.403 --> 00:54:05.205
- Ted!
- Sorry, the homos.

843
00:54:05.207 --> 00:54:08.746
This is exactly what he has been doing
with homos, and I say that is wrong!

844
00:54:08.748 --> 00:54:12.219
Miss Jackson, please control your client
or i'll hold you both contempt of court.

845
00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:14.358
Piss off.

846
00:54:14.359 --> 00:54:19.016
I'm standing up for myself, and I'm
standing up for the homos, we deserve respect.

847
00:54:19.018 --> 00:54:23.742
- Ted, shut up!
- Fine.

848
00:54:29.994 --> 00:54:32.600
Your honor, I would like to call
Ted Clubberlang to the stand.

849
00:54:32.601 --> 00:54:35.872
Yes! My turn assholes.

850
00:54:41.086 --> 00:54:45.025
- Ted, do you love your wife?
- Objection!

851
00:54:45.362 --> 00:54:48.900
- She's not his wife. The marriage was anulled.
- I rephrase.

852
00:54:49.705 --> 00:54:51.706
Do you love Tami-Lynn?

853
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:53.844
I love my wife.

854
00:54:54.381 --> 00:54:57.519
Okay my wife! more than anything in the world.

855
00:54:57.521 --> 00:54:59.190
We're married, I do not care what anyone says.

856
00:54:59.192 --> 00:55:02.798
So you're saying you are capable of feeling love?

857
00:55:04.736 --> 00:55:07.744
Yeah. Hey, it must be weird for you guys
to have a doll up here in the stand

858
00:55:07.746 --> 00:55:10.484
with no kid pointing to where his uncle touched him.

859
00:55:12.156 --> 00:55:15.694
Um no yeah, I am capable of love and other stuff.

860
00:55:16.164 --> 00:55:20.505
Ted? Do you believe you have a soul?

861
00:55:21.708 --> 00:55:24.246
What did you think,

862
00:55:24.448 --> 00:55:27.386
I would do at this moment

863
00:55:27.456 --> 00:55:30.394
when you're still before me

864
00:55:30.395 --> 00:55:33.266
with tears in your eyes.

865
00:55:33.869 --> 00:55:36.873
- Does that answer your question?
- Objection, Your Honor.

866
00:55:37.009 --> 00:55:39.277
Overruled.

867
00:55:39.414 --> 00:55:41.483
What it is man.

868
00:55:42.087 --> 00:55:44.157
- Ted?
- Right, sorry.

869
00:55:45.361 --> 00:55:52.175
Look, I'm not a scientist. Okay?
I don't know exactly what makes a person a person

870
00:55:52.512 --> 00:55:57.317
All I know is I feel stuff.
Just like all you guys,

871
00:55:57.922 --> 00:56:00.191
and I don't think I want to be trated any different.

872
00:56:04.404 --> 00:56:06.675
Capable of love.

873
00:56:07.077 --> 00:56:09.346
Aware of his own consciousness.

874
00:56:12.019 --> 00:56:16.159
It seems pretty human to me.
No further questions.

875
00:56:17.231 --> 00:56:23.578
Mr Kidder, you were an employee at
Hasbro for 1976 to 1998, is that correct?

876
00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.983
Yes, I supervised the stuffing of the teddy bears.

877
00:56:26.253 --> 00:56:30.391
- And what is that stuffing made off?
- Synthetic cotton, poly blend.

878
00:56:30.528 --> 00:56:34.268
- Is there anything else in there?
- The bear products are affixed with

879
00:56:34.269 --> 00:56:38.076
an electronic device in the chest.
Wich can be programmed

880
00:56:38.078 --> 00:56:40.281
To say anyone of five phrases.

881
00:56:45.495 --> 00:56:47.161
Ted...

882
00:56:47.565 --> 00:56:49.835
Would you please press your chest?

883
00:56:51.506 --> 00:56:53.242
What?

884
00:56:53.244 --> 00:56:56.115
Please follow the instructions, Mr. Clubberlang.

885
00:57:00.995 --> 00:57:03.533
I love you!

886
00:57:12.954 --> 00:57:15.223
No further questions.

887
00:57:17.365 --> 00:57:19.903
Also on the news, a petty
court case is beginning to get

888
00:57:19.904 --> 00:57:23.042
national attention for it's civil rights ramification.

889
00:57:23.043 --> 00:57:27.318
Ted the bear, who some of you may remember,
came to life back in the mid eighties

890
00:57:27.319 --> 00:57:31.996
right here in Boston, is suing to prove he is indeed a person.

891
00:57:31.997 --> 00:57:34.468
Well, so...what are we even talking about here?

892
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:39.542
What we are talking about is a civil rights issue.

893
00:57:39.543 --> 00:57:41.347
- This bear has rights.
- Oh, please, it's a toy.

894
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:43.486
Then why are you calling it a he?

895
00:57:43.487 --> 00:57:48.232
Look, we call it the Statue of Liberty a she but
we all know it's an object made of copper and steel.

896
00:57:48.233 --> 00:57:52.843
Yes, but she isn't consciouss or sentient, he is.

897
00:57:52.844 --> 00:57:57.451
Come on, are you really going to sit there
and tell me that this stuffed doll is a person?

898
00:57:57.452 --> 00:57:58.387
- Not at all.

899
00:57:58.389 --> 00:57:59.857
We all agree, all the time.

900
00:57:59.859 --> 00:58:02.864
I do not think he should
want to be considered a person,

901
00:58:02.865 --> 00:58:05.871
After all, Ted spent many years
sleeping and cuddling with a child.

902
00:58:05.872 --> 00:58:10.280
That's cute when you're a stuffed animal,
if you're a person it's a felony.

903
00:58:11.819 --> 00:58:15.023
Ted, do you have anything to say in your own defense?

904
00:58:15.224 --> 00:58:19.499
I am not an animal!

905
00:58:23.108 --> 00:58:26.913
You see your honor? He is not an animal.

906
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:37.272
I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm on my period.

907
00:58:37.541 --> 00:58:42.049
And live from New York with "Saturday Night"!

908
00:59:00.526 --> 00:59:04.265
- What is taking them so long?
- IIs it bad that they're taking this long?

909
00:59:04.269 --> 00:59:07.872
It's not good nor bad, it just means
they're probably having a debate.

910
00:59:07.942 --> 00:59:10.346
Johny, you know it's time to play the Beetlejuice card.

911
00:59:10.347 --> 00:59:13.352
- What do you mean?
- I mean, say his name three times..

912
00:59:13.353 --> 00:59:14.956
- What?
- Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice

913
00:59:14.958 --> 00:59:16.693
Shut up.

914
00:59:16.763 --> 00:59:19.500
Are you fucking crazy? We don't want
that guy running around in here.

915
00:59:19.501 --> 00:59:21.170
No Johnny, he'll be on our side. He'll help us.

916
00:59:21.172 --> 00:59:23.507
- Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.
- Hey, you're meddling with powers

917
00:59:23.508 --> 00:59:25.714
you don't understand. Cut the shit.

918
00:59:38.009 --> 00:59:40.145
Please be seating.

919
00:59:41.951 --> 00:59:47.726
Mr. Willer, has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes we have Your Honor.

920
00:59:47.764 --> 00:59:51.435
In the case of Ted vs
the common wealth of Massachusetts

921
00:59:51.572 --> 00:59:57.648
We the jury, find for the common
wealth that Ted is not a person.

922
01:00:09.412 --> 01:00:10.879
Very well!

923
01:00:10.881 --> 01:00:13.886
The defendant here is hereby legally deemed property.

924
01:00:13.888 --> 01:00:16.558
The definition entails the rights there of

925
01:00:16.628 --> 01:00:20.499
and I will be recognized in the terms
set by the state of Massachusetts.

926
01:00:21.639 --> 01:00:24.777
The court wishes to thank the jury for it's service.

927
01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.796
Are you sure you can get him?

928
01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:37.939
Remember. You're on your own out there.
Hasbro can have no connection to this.

929
01:00:37.941 --> 01:00:40.010
I'll get him.

930
01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:42.750
And when I have him I'll call you with the code phrase.

931
01:00:43.553 --> 01:00:46.827
- Do you remember what it is?
- Yes, I remember.

932
01:00:46.828 --> 01:00:48.829
- Can you say it, just for safety?
- That's not ...

933
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:50.099
- Say it.
- I will not!

934
01:00:50.101 --> 01:00:51.368
- Say it.
- Do I have to.

935
01:00:51.369 --> 01:00:53.038
- Say it!
- Fresh cakes.

936
01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:55.578
Fresh cakes.

937
01:01:03.531 --> 01:01:07.068
This isn't fucking fair. Ted is a good man.

938
01:01:07.674 --> 01:01:10.344
Why is he being treated differently than everybody else?

939
01:01:11.014 --> 01:01:14.285
It's what this country does best.
Putting different people

940
01:01:14.287 --> 01:01:17.628
in little groups and make them
watch Tyler Perry. That's wrong!

941
01:01:19.031 --> 01:01:22.505
- I'm so sorry, baby.
- No, I'm sorry, I thought

942
01:01:22.507 --> 01:01:24.440
I'd built a better case.

943
01:01:24.444 --> 01:01:27.651
It's just that the reality that
you have a really shitty lawyer.

944
01:01:27.652 --> 01:01:28.985
Hey, come on.

945
01:01:28.987 --> 01:01:31.323
No one is blaming you,
at least you did everything you could.

946
01:01:31.926 --> 01:01:33.996
I'm just sitting here and ...

947
01:01:34.667 --> 01:01:37.872
- I can not believe it's official.
- So what are we gonna do know?

948
01:01:38.141 --> 01:01:40.878
We can't take this and lie down.
We gotta do something.

949
01:01:41.681 --> 01:01:44.551
You know what we're gonna do?
We'ew gonna call Patrick Meighan.

950
01:01:45.022 --> 01:01:48.896
- Who is that?
- He's the top civil rights attorney in America.

951
01:01:48.898 --> 01:01:51.436
Wait, tis he the one that got
that female midget into the marines?

952
01:01:51.437 --> 01:01:53.641
Yes, that had a sad ending though.

953
01:01:53.642 --> 01:01:55.178
You remember she was in a veteran state parade

954
01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:57.902
when someone handed her a
bunch of ballons, pffft gone.

955
01:01:58.118 --> 01:02:02.192
- That's verery sad, very sad for the family.
- If anyone can get this verdict overturned it's him.

956
01:02:02.194 --> 01:02:06.266
He's not cheap but we have become
such a high profile case I feel like

957
01:02:06.267 --> 01:02:10.076
he might take the case pro bono.

958
01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:13.817
He's a sucker for media.

959
01:02:13.819 --> 01:02:17.623
- Hey Johnny, how about a beer?
- Yeah, it's a good idea.

960
01:02:18.096 --> 01:02:20.968
Hi, I'm calling for Patrick Meighan.
This is Samantha Jackson.

961
01:02:20.969 --> 01:02:24.240
I'm defending Ted Clubberlang
in Ted vs Massachusetts.

962
01:02:26.313 --> 01:02:30.053
Hi, Mr. Meighan, thank you so much for taking my call.

963
01:02:31.792 --> 01:02:34.728
Oh, you have been following the case?
That's great.

964
01:02:35.734 --> 01:02:37.803
Yes, that's actually why I'm calling.

965
01:02:37.806 --> 01:02:43.616
Yeah, I was wondering if maybe you could
consider helping us try to overturn the verdict.

966
01:02:45.758 --> 01:02:48.095
Well, yeah, I mean, it would have
to be a pro bono situation

967
01:02:48.628 --> 01:02:51.767
because we're really not working with much money,

968
01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:54.774
but I think you will be impressed with my client.

969
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:57.379
- Aha mother fucker!
- Sure!

970
01:02:57.518 --> 01:03:00.656
Yeah, great. Okay, thank you so much.

971
01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:03.863
Okay, I'll see you then.
Bye.

972
01:03:03.865 --> 01:03:08.207
Oh my God. He said he'll meet with us on
friday at 9:am at his office in New York.

973
01:03:08.274 --> 01:03:11.745
- Is he gonna take the case?
- I don't wanna jinx it but I think so.

974
01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:13.749
Oh my God, did you hear that Johny?

975
01:03:13.751 --> 01:03:17.090
- I still got a shot!
- Oh my God, we gotta celebrate!

976
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.497
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Let's go down to the improve

977
01:03:19.498 --> 01:03:21.635
- And yell out suggestions?
- Fuck yeah!

978
01:03:21.837 --> 01:03:23.973
So first we need a historical event.

979
01:03:23.974 --> 01:03:25.977
- Who's got an event?
- 9/11!

980
01:03:26.113 --> 01:03:30.388
Okay, okay..maybe something else.
Let's start with a person.

981
01:03:30.389 --> 01:03:33.327
- Robbie Williams!
- Okay, alright, for real guys.

982
01:03:33.395 --> 01:03:37.002
- Seriously, who's got a person?
- Robbie Williams or 9/11

983
01:03:37.004 --> 01:03:41.077
Alright we heard from these guys.
Lets give someone over her a chance.

984
01:03:41.547 --> 01:03:43.417
How about a location?
Come up with a location.

985
01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:46.689
- The offices of Callie Hepto.
- Seriously sir, I just need a location.

986
01:03:46.691 --> 01:03:49.895
Ferguson in Missouri.

987
01:03:49.899 --> 01:03:53.170
- Germanwings cocktail.
- Okay, I heard Starbucks!

988
01:03:53.172 --> 01:03:55.108
- No you did not.
- Nobody said Starbucks!

989
01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:59.451
- Who is in the Starbucks?
- Bill Cosby!

990
01:03:59.519 --> 01:04:01.454
You people are monsters!

991
01:04:01.791 --> 01:04:04.328
We are giving you the tools buddy.
Make some fucking comedy.

992
01:04:15.421 --> 01:04:17.489
Alrigh, we'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

993
01:04:17.625 --> 01:04:19.294
I love you so much Teddy.

994
01:04:19.697 --> 01:04:23.234
You go kick some ass, because I am
not taking of this wedding ring.

995
01:04:23.506 --> 01:04:26.378
I love you too baby, I'll see you soon.

996
01:05:21.368 --> 01:05:24.306
Hey Sam why do you have a double bag that says Arizona state?

997
01:05:24.308 --> 01:05:27.644
- Because that's where I went to school.
- You went to  Arizona state?

998
01:05:27.914 --> 01:05:31.253
- Yeah, why?
- Oh man, that's why we lost the case.

999
01:05:31.255 --> 01:05:32.523
- I know.
- You're dicks.

1000
01:05:32.524 --> 01:05:35.863
Arizona state. How many times have
you been fucked on a house ball?

1001
01:05:38.404 --> 01:05:40.139
- Oh, come on!
- Did you write your dissertation about

1002
01:05:40.142 --> 01:05:42.044
the collective work of Red Bull?

1003
01:05:43.016 --> 01:05:46.285
- Yes, I did, I got an A.
- So you say Arizona State University

1004
01:05:46.287 --> 01:05:49.361
or do you just say HPPU?

1005
01:05:53.773 --> 01:05:56.710
This is perfect. We're gonna get to the city before 10.

1006
01:05:56.712 --> 01:06:00.118
- Hey Sam, how's your boring salad?
- Oh, it's actually delicious.

1007
01:06:00.253 --> 01:06:03.658
Everybody always say that about
their salads, all a bunch of fucking liers.

1008
01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:06.599
- No, I loveit, it's really good.
- Have some cookie crisps.

1009
01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.471
- You need something nutritional.
- Why do you think I want your cookie crisp?

1010
01:06:09.473 --> 01:06:11.409
- Because you've been staring at it.
- No!

1011
01:06:11.411 --> 01:06:14.283
Hey, what's the deal here?
Are you guys ever gonna make out or what?

1012
01:06:14.685 --> 01:06:17.023
- Teddy, come on dude.
- No, I'm just saying.

1013
01:06:17.224 --> 01:06:22.098
You look like you're hitting it off you know.
I mean, Sam, you dig him right?

1014
01:06:23.436 --> 01:06:26.375
Hey, where the hell is my coffee?
I've been waiting for ten minutes!

1015
01:06:26.377 --> 01:06:28.582
I'm so sorry sir, I forget. I'll get it right away.

1016
01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:31.521
Jesus, you're a waitress, you're not
building rockets, figure it out!

1017
01:06:32.257 --> 01:06:33.994
What a prick.

1018
01:06:33.995 --> 01:06:36.799
Hey, 20 bucks I can toss a
cookie crisp in his ass crack.

1019
01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:39.539
Wait, let me try. I used to pitch
for the softball team at Arizona state.

1020
01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.412
Was that the mascot with a broken condom?

1021
01:06:42.413 --> 01:06:44.347
Shut up.

1022
01:06:46.823 --> 01:06:48.557
Who did that?

1023
01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:51.434
Oh, Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding me.

1024
01:06:51.436 --> 01:06:55.372
- Now we are assholes for what you did.
- I swear to God I'll kickyour damn ass.

1025
01:06:55.375 --> 01:06:56.975
Who was it?

1026
01:06:56.977 --> 01:06:59.047
Um sir, I apologize for my 5 year old son.

1027
01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:04.326
I'm sorry for the cookie crisp in your bum bum.

1028
01:07:04.663 --> 01:07:08.335
Well, under the circumstances, I guess it's okay.

1029
01:07:08.472 --> 01:07:10.875
Oh my god, now we're even bigger assholes.

1030
01:07:10.876 --> 01:07:12.679
Go get my cookie crisp out of his ass.

1031
01:07:12.681 --> 01:07:14.681
Are you guys making trouble over here?

1032
01:07:14.682 --> 01:07:16.352
No mam, we're just minding our own business.

1033
01:07:16.354 --> 01:07:18.625
Well try to keep your boyfriend under control here, yeah?

1034
01:07:18.626 --> 01:07:20.560
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

1035
01:07:20.565 --> 01:07:23.035
Ah good.

1036
01:07:23.505 --> 01:07:26.073
- I would just like the check, thanks.
- Of course.

1037
01:07:28.982 --> 01:07:32.923
Oh my God. Did you see that?
She was totally giving you the "Fuck me" eyes.

1038
01:07:32.925 --> 01:07:35.463
- No, she wasn't.
- She was giving you the "Fuck me" eyes.

1039
01:07:35.464 --> 01:07:39.739
- What are the "Fuck me" eyes?
- Some women just have the "Fuck me" eyes.

1040
01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:44.347
- Do I have "Fuck me" eyes?-
- No you have the "Give us the ring, my precious" eyes.

1041
01:07:44.886 --> 01:07:47.332
We'd better get going. We got two hours
of driving left and I'm kinda beat.

1042
01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:49.226
Yes, we have to be well rested for tomorrow.

1043
01:07:49.228 --> 01:07:51.398
Well, I'll drive, you can take a nap.

1044
01:07:51.399 --> 01:07:54.271
- You do not have a license.
- Who cares? Johnny lets me drive once in a while..

1045
01:07:54.272 --> 01:07:57.111
Johnny lets me drive once in a while,
always two-handed, I'm a fucking pro.

1046
01:07:57.112 --> 01:08:00.383
Besides, I've been kicked around alot this week

1047
01:08:00.385 --> 01:08:05.995
- I just want to feel useful, you know.
- 20 minutes behind the wheel.

1048
01:09:43.547 --> 01:09:46.284
- What the fuck?
- Well Sam, it's been 20 minutes, wanna take over?

1049
01:09:59.248 --> 01:10:02.920
Listen Sam, I'm real sorry, that
barn just came out of nowhere.

1050
01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:06.662
No it's my fault. I should never have let you drive.

1051
01:10:07.064 --> 01:10:10.605
Yeah, well, you were wrong,
you were wrong to do that.

1052
01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:13.877
But you know, that and the trial is
the only things you fucked up.

1053
01:10:14.814 --> 01:10:19.758
I can't see shit in here.We have to
wait til tomorrow to get the car out.

1054
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.830
- Wait, are we gonna spend the night here?
- Yeah, we'll be fine.

1055
01:10:22.831 --> 01:10:24.592
We just need to find some firewood.

1056
01:10:35.723 --> 01:10:37.376
What the hell?

1057
01:10:37.413 --> 01:10:39.413
<font color="#008000">Final edit by M.R. Sumon</font>

1058
01:10:42.599 --> 01:10:44.802
Holy shit! Hey Ted!

1059
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.274
You know what this is?

1060
01:10:47.275 --> 01:10:48.878
It's super Silver Hayes.

1061
01:10:49.212 --> 01:10:52.613
Ordinary marijuana mixed with
lemon and became super Silver Hayes.

1062
01:10:53.018 --> 01:10:55.020
It's totally potent. I only had one in my life ...

1063
01:10:55.021 --> 01:10:56.890
and it was the best I ever had.

1064
01:10:57.157 --> 01:11:00.096
What the hell is a leaf of this
stuff doing in the middle of a...

1065
01:11:29.016 --> 01:11:32.419
Dear God, dear God in heaven.

1066
01:11:32.687 --> 01:11:35.223
it is so beautiful.

1067
01:11:35.493 --> 01:11:38.029
So beautiful.

1068
01:11:38.099 --> 01:11:41.802
Not enough words, no words.

1069
01:11:42.505 --> 01:11:44.774
He should've sent for me.

1070
01:11:52.323 --> 01:11:54.792
They're moving in Harrits.

1071
01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.863
They do move in Harrits.

1072
01:12:00.738 --> 01:12:03.808
Please tell me that's not the only
bong you brought on this trip.

1073
01:12:03.809 --> 01:12:06.680
Yes, Sam, this puts us in a
kind of awkward position here.

1074
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:09.417
We want to get high too.

1075
01:12:09.486 --> 01:12:12.489
Is this hilarious?
I got it at bachelorette party.

1076
01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.698
- It's so stupid. Here, try.
- Uh no.

1077
01:12:17.034 --> 01:12:19.503
- Why?
- I don't wat to put a big class cock in my mouth..

1078
01:12:19.504 --> 01:12:22.265
Oh, you think this is big?

1079
01:12:22.843 --> 01:12:26.114
- Haha, Johnny you walked right into that one pal.
- This is all I brought.

1080
01:12:26.115 --> 01:12:27.918
How about this? I'm gonna go check out the
barn and see if I can find a solar can or something.

1081
01:12:27.919 --> 01:12:30.188
for us to make an actual bong.

1082
01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:32.460
- Yeah, see if you can make a non dick bong.
- Yeah, that's the name of the South Korean president.

1083
01:12:37.335 --> 01:12:39.405
She get's it?

1084
01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:42.475
- What?
- Be right back.

1085
01:12:43.411 --> 01:12:45.081
Sorry.

1086
01:12:45.082 --> 01:12:47.551
Do not worry. This is nice.

1087
01:12:47.552 --> 01:12:51.224
You know? I always wanted a wife to get stoned
with in the woods but she never wanted to.

1088
01:12:51.227 --> 01:12:52.761
Really? Wow.

1089
01:12:52.762 --> 01:12:55.432
- That's the cornerstone of any great marriage.
- I agree.

1090
01:13:00.842 --> 01:13:05.316
- So do you think this Meighan guy will help us?
- I mean, honestly I don't know.

1091
01:13:07.454 --> 01:13:09.391
But we're going to the right place.

1092
01:13:10.527 --> 01:13:12.862
Listen, I just really want to thank you for all you've done

1093
01:13:12.864 --> 01:13:15.746
and all you're doing for us, I know it's not making you rich.

1094
01:13:15.935 --> 01:13:17.137
Please ...

1095
01:13:17.138 --> 01:13:19.540
there are more important things in life than money.

1096
01:13:20.745 --> 01:13:26.489
Look, I don't know what kind of mojo
was in that wish when you were a child

1097
01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:28.757
but this bear, alive.

1098
01:13:29.494 --> 01:13:33.765
And it seems to me that once
the law devalues one kind of life...

1099
01:13:34.169 --> 01:13:36.301
How soon before it devalues another?

1100
01:13:36.706 --> 01:13:38.909
Who get's subjugated after the bear?

1101
01:13:40.446 --> 01:13:42.848
You're really smart, you know that?

1102
01:13:43.518 --> 01:13:47.324
- How come you do not have a guy?
- Dude, have you seen the guys in Boston?

1103
01:13:47.525 --> 01:13:50.194
I'm supposed to date some pale guy
who's a wife beater under that bruise jacket

1104
01:13:50.195 --> 01:13:53.200
with a shamrock tat on his calf?

1105
01:13:53.201 --> 01:13:54.669
Nope!

1106
01:13:54.806 --> 01:13:56.940
Yeah, that's so dumb.

1107
01:13:58.076 --> 01:14:01.082
Well, I couldn' find any cans but
there some awesome shit

1108
01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:04.751
in that barn. Look at this. I found a
cowboy hat, a rifle and a guitar

1109
01:14:04.752 --> 01:14:06.555
Hey, be careful with that.

1110
01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:09.093
No, it's okay, is not loaded.

1111
01:14:10.031 --> 01:14:11.967
And my fucking nose came off.

1112
01:14:13.638 --> 01:14:17.443
I wonder who all this belongs to.
I mean, maybe we should find someplace else.

1113
01:14:17.711 --> 01:14:19.514
Where in the middle of nowhere.

1114
01:14:19.515 --> 01:14:22.437
If we get out of here by
dawn we should be fine, right?

1115
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:27.126
- You play the guitar?
- A little bit.

1116
01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:28.929
I learned when I was a kid.

1117
01:17:04.005 --> 01:17:06.340
You got it. Come on, put your legs into it.

1118
01:17:09.481 --> 01:17:11.217
There you go. Nice job.

1119
01:17:11.218 --> 01:17:13.286
So listen, I gotta ask.

1120
01:17:13.287 --> 01:17:16.758
Was it just kissing last night
or was there finger stuff?

1121
01:17:22.836 --> 01:17:25.708
We got alot of pot in this car.
I wish we could smoke it.

1122
01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:29.113
We are gonna smoke it but just
put it under the seat for now.

1123
01:17:29.114 --> 01:17:30.917
- We dont wanna go to jail.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

1124
01:17:48.082 --> 01:17:50.751
- Oh what the fuck? What are you doing?
- Hashtag!

1125
01:17:50.886 --> 01:17:54.757
- "My amazing summer".
- God dammit, what the hell is wrong wiith you?

1126
01:17:54.758 --> 01:17:57.162
Oh I fucking own you you bastard.

1127
01:17:57.164 --> 01:17:59.701
What do you mean, I was just messing around.

1128
01:17:59.702 --> 01:18:01.704
- Shut up and suck that dick.
- Fuck you!

1129
01:18:30.221 --> 01:18:34.828
- Watch where you're walking!
- It's a crossroad jackass! We have right of way.

1130
01:18:34.829 --> 01:18:38.437
Hey, what the hell you do
walking around just like Star Wars?

1131
01:18:38.438 --> 01:18:41.641
It's Comic Con you idiot.
We're going down to the Jawa center.

1132
01:18:41.642 --> 01:18:44.512
Well you are the idiots, cause
you three guys would never walk together.

1133
01:18:44.513 --> 01:18:47.450
Yeah, you're his boss and you two are enemies!

1134
01:18:47.451 --> 01:18:50.722
- Yes, bite me captain Kirk!
- Come on, that's Star Trek.

1135
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:53.862
- Yes. are 2 different franchises.
- Sorry guys, she doesn't know.

1136
01:18:53.864 --> 01:18:56.345
No it's okey. Im sorry you have to deal with that.

1137
01:19:00.075 --> 01:19:03.311
Hey come on, it's not worth it. It's not worth it.

1138
01:19:21.512 --> 01:19:24.194
Patrick Meighan, got a classy set up huh?

1139
01:19:30.128 --> 01:19:32.797
And there is our first impression.

1140
01:19:33.133 --> 01:19:35.535
Ms. Jackson? Mr. Meighan will see you now.

1141
01:19:35.536 --> 01:19:37.538
Oh okay, thank you.

1142
01:19:43.685 --> 01:19:48.357
- Ms Jackson, do come in. -
- Mr Meighan, this is such an honor.

1143
01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.295
Thank you so much for meeting with us.

1144
01:19:50.296 --> 01:19:52.498
Not at all, it's my pleasure.
Please, sit down.

1145
01:19:52.701 --> 01:19:56.172
Hey, this office is fucking awesome.
Yeah, totally.

1146
01:19:56.173 --> 01:19:58.575
Hey, do you ever bring chicks up here?

1147
01:19:59.178 --> 01:20:04.253
- What do you think?
- I think I want to sleep in a bed made of your voice.

1148
01:20:05.389 --> 01:20:09.728
I'll get right down to it. I don't
want to waste to much of your time.

1149
01:20:10.599 --> 01:20:13.668
Ted, I've been reviewing your file.

1150
01:20:13.737 --> 01:20:17.209
And while I'm sympathetic to your cause, I'm sorry to say

1151
01:20:17.544 --> 01:20:21.483
- I won't be taking your case.
- What? Why?

1152
01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:23.619
Well, it comes down to this.

1153
01:20:25.558 --> 01:20:28.494
You want to be human in the eyes of the law.

1154
01:20:28.764 --> 01:20:31.366
That's a hard sell, even for me.

1155
01:20:31.636 --> 01:20:36.577
You see, the important thing about being
human is making a contribution to society.

1156
01:20:36.645 --> 01:20:39.315
Assisting in the bettering of your race.

1157
01:20:39.382 --> 01:20:41.183
You've done none of that.

1158
01:20:41.386 --> 01:20:46.100
I read about your life, the drugs, the parties,
the prostitues, the arrests.

1159
01:20:46.101 --> 01:20:50.934
Mr. Meighan, we have come a long way to
meet you because you said you could help.

1160
01:20:50.936 --> 01:20:53.539
I said I would consider it.

1161
01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:55.009
And I have.

1162
01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:00.953
Ted, you're special.
You could've been an inspiration to the world.

1163
01:21:01.622 --> 01:21:03.888
You could've been a leader, a role model.

1164
01:21:04.627 --> 01:21:06.294
Instead you're....

1165
01:21:07.233 --> 01:21:08.834
Justin Bieber.

1166
01:21:08.835 --> 01:21:10.236
Fuck you!

1167
01:21:10.237 --> 01:21:11.172
- Hey Ted!
- Sorry.

1168
01:21:11.173 --> 01:21:12.172
He doesn't mean that.

1169
01:21:12.173 --> 01:21:13.841
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..

1170
01:21:13.843 --> 01:21:17.982
There's just no indication that you've had
any positive effect on the world around you.

1171
01:21:17.984 --> 01:21:20.252
Well that's not true, he had a positive effect on me.

1172
01:21:20.988 --> 01:21:26.129
Would that positive effect be your
joint arrest for purchasing marijuana in 2003?

1173
01:21:26.130 --> 01:21:28.851
Well how the fuck do you prepare
for a Foo Fighter concert?

1174
01:21:30.939 --> 01:21:33.341
Do you know why you lost this case?

1175
01:21:34.346 --> 01:21:36.547
It can't be arguing with reason.

1176
01:21:36.816 --> 01:21:39.688
What the president says affect the public directly.

1177
01:21:40.155 --> 01:21:43.492
And unfortunately the public
doesn't judge by reason.

1178
01:21:43.493 --> 01:21:45.897
They judge by emotion.

1179
01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:49.304
And you can not appeal any emotional conviction.

1180
01:21:50.373 --> 01:21:54.010
Nonetheless I wish you all the best in your efforts.

1181
01:21:56.115 --> 01:21:59.137
He needs help, and from what I know about you,

1182
01:21:59.138 --> 01:22:02.158
at one point in your career
that would have been enough.

1183
01:22:02.997 --> 01:22:06.534
I'm sorry you're not who I'd hope you'd be.

1184
01:22:15.151 --> 01:22:17.353
Are those supposed to just be take.

1185
01:22:19.024 --> 01:22:21.093
Those arn't supposed to be there.

1186
01:22:32.382 --> 01:22:34.850
So that is, I'm property.

1187
01:22:35.252 --> 01:22:37.522
No lights, no nothing.

1188
01:22:37.857 --> 01:22:40.592
Ted dude, I'm so sorry, this completely sucks.

1189
01:22:41.062 --> 01:22:45.067
It feels terrible. I let you guys down all over again.

1190
01:22:45.139 --> 01:22:48.340
Hey, you didn't let us down Sam, you did your best.

1191
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:54.016
And look, regardless of all this shit, you're
still the best thing that happened to me in a long time.

1192
01:23:00.431 --> 01:23:02.300
Oh! That's great, that's fucking great!
I'm glad you guys are so happy.

1193
01:23:02.301 --> 01:23:04.502
What?

1194
01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:09.111
What do you mean what? I'm totally screwed here.

1195
01:23:09.112 --> 01:23:11.115
And you're sitting there basically banging
my lawyer and she is probably still fucking billing us.

1196
01:23:11.315 --> 01:23:14.723
- Well don't yell at us, we didn't do anything!
- Yeah, exactly, exactly ...

1197
01:23:14.724 --> 01:23:17.660
Maybe if you guys had spent a little
less time mooning over each other

1198
01:23:17.661 --> 01:23:20.933
Sam could've won this thing
and I wouldn't be a fucking thing.

1199
01:23:20.934 --> 01:23:23.201
Like garbage or a piece of shit.

1200
01:23:23.203 --> 01:23:25.874
Hey, we've been fighting alongside you the whole way.

1201
01:23:26.008 --> 01:23:30.014
And remember, you were the one
pushing me to get back up on the horse,

1202
01:23:30.015 --> 01:23:32.486
- and when I finally meet someone you're giving me shit?
- No, you're right, okay, it's totally fine.

1203
01:23:32.487 --> 01:23:35.424
I have no job, no marriage and no life.

1204
01:23:35.425 --> 01:23:38.629
But you have fun porking Golum
while I l'm left with shit.

1205
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:41.032
- Ted!
- Who's Gollum?

1206
01:23:41.236 --> 01:23:43.305
She's a model.
Ted, come back!

1207
01:23:43.373 --> 01:23:45.174
- Leave me alone!
- Ted!

1208
01:23:49.719 --> 01:23:51.251
Shit.

1209
01:24:03.542 --> 01:24:05.410
Woah, sorry bro.

1210
01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:43.744
Hey Ted!

1211
01:24:45.348 --> 01:24:46.482
Guy?

1212
01:24:46.483 --> 01:24:48.087
I thought that was you.
What happened man?

1213
01:24:48.088 --> 01:24:50.221
Hey Rick? It is Ted.

1214
01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:52.291
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey, what's going on?

1215
01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.762
What are you doing here?

1216
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:58.503
You know, I just feel at home among the outcasts.
What are you guys doing here?

1217
01:24:58.838 --> 01:25:00.974
Well, you know, Rick and I kinda came here as a gag.

1218
01:25:00.975 --> 01:25:04.113
Shut Up! Dress up like we're into
this shit and fuck with the nerds.

1219
01:25:04.114 --> 01:25:08.220
Hey, Staiss, why don't you go bring
me some big lichu, how about that?

1220
01:25:13.598 --> 01:25:15.867
Well, good luck with your dick there.

1221
01:25:15.935 --> 01:25:17.937
Right on, you too man.

1222
01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:20.274
God dammit! That underwear had shit on it!

1223
01:25:25.486 --> 01:25:28.555
- Hey. Are you Ted?
- Uh, yeah.

1224
01:25:31.561 --> 01:25:35.601
This is so exciting! I was such a big fan
of yours in the early nineties.

1225
01:25:36.306 --> 01:25:37.908
Oh, well, thanks alot.

1226
01:25:37.909 --> 01:25:40.176
- What's your name?
- I'm Rafael.

1227
01:25:40.179 --> 01:25:42.380
Do you think that I can take a picture with you?

1228
01:25:42.649 --> 01:25:44.251
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

1229
01:25:44.252 --> 01:25:46.119
Great, great, follow me.

1230
01:25:47.992 --> 01:25:49.860
Uh, okay, why are we doing this back here?

1231
01:25:49.861 --> 01:25:53.334
Well you're a celebrity, I dont want you to
get mobbed when people recognize you.

1232
01:25:53.335 --> 01:25:56.338
Yeah, that's true. I've been mistaken
for an ewok three times today.

1233
01:25:56.339 --> 01:25:57.807
Alright, let's do this.

1234
01:26:01.882 --> 01:26:04.420
Holy shit! Donny!

1235
01:26:04.421 --> 01:26:06.556
It's so good to see you Ted.

1236
01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:08.960
It's been some time, hasn't it?

1237
01:26:08.961 --> 01:26:11.164
Os since you ripped me in half?

1238
01:26:12.301 --> 01:26:15.369
That was not supposed to happen.
That was was an accident.

1239
01:26:16.575 --> 01:26:18.844
I have some big plans for you, Ted.

1240
01:26:19.445 --> 01:26:20.982
Very big plans.

1241
01:26:21.449 --> 01:26:23.119
I need you to come with me now.

1242
01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.587
Go to hell!

1243
01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:39.146
Nice lunch späs!

1244
01:26:48.965 --> 01:26:50.766
Hey, what the hell?

1245
01:26:55.041 --> 01:26:58.115
He could be anywhere, we're not gonna
find him. We sould just wait by the car.

1246
01:26:58.116 --> 01:26:59.572
What do you mean? We have to find him okay?

1247
01:26:59.708 --> 01:27:01.708
He's a teddy bear on his own in New York for Gods sake.

1248
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:08.399
- Hello?
- Hey Johnny, It's me, you gotta help me.

1249
01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.936
Ted where are you? We've looked everywhere for you.

1250
01:27:10.937 --> 01:27:13.740
I'm iat Comic Con, but John, it's Donny.

1251
01:27:13.741 --> 01:27:16.280
He's here. You gotta come over here.

1252
01:27:16.281 --> 01:27:18.015
What the fuck, did you just say Donny?

1253
01:27:18.016 --> 01:27:20.852
- John, what's going on?
- Yes, it's him.

1254
01:27:22.558 --> 01:27:26.459
Oh shit!

1255
01:27:27.133 --> 01:27:28.234
Ted?

1256
01:27:28.235 --> 01:27:29.902
- Ted, hello?
- What's the matter?

1257
01:27:29.903 --> 01:27:32.585
Oh my God, deja vu.
We gotta get to Comic Con, come one.

1258
01:27:37.450 --> 01:27:38.986
Get out of the way!

1259
01:27:50.673 --> 01:27:52.342
You know...

1260
01:27:53.278 --> 01:27:55.414
I really love Neil Diamond.

1261
01:27:55.951 --> 01:28:00.355
Especially that song that they're
singing at the red sox game.

1262
01:28:02.562 --> 01:28:04.697
This is so infectious.

1263
01:28:05.164 --> 01:28:07.435
You just can't help but sing along.

1264
01:28:28.541 --> 01:28:32.375
Fuck!

1265
01:28:36.088 --> 01:28:38.023
Hey! What are you doing to that bear?

1266
01:28:38.024 --> 01:28:40.960
- I'm sorry, I ...
- You better be planning on buying that!

1267
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:44.101
It just reminds me of when I was a kid.

1268
01:28:44.102 --> 01:28:46.304
Yes, that's great. Thats $40.

1269
01:28:48.978 --> 01:28:52.879
$40, here.

1270
01:28:59.661 --> 01:29:01.130
Do you see him anywhere?

1271
01:29:01.131 --> 01:29:03.000
No, let's try in there.

1272
01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.408
Have anyone of you seen a talking teddy bear?

1273
01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:10.545
They're about to annonce the new Superman.

1274
01:29:10.747 --> 01:29:13.084
The new Superman is ...

1275
01:29:13.418 --> 01:29:14.886
Jonah Hill!

1276
01:29:14.956 --> 01:29:17.224
- Fuck!
- Who's Superman?

1277
01:29:17.225 --> 01:29:19.546
- What?
- I 'm just kidding, I'm fucking with you.

1278
01:29:20.831 --> 01:29:25.972
And if that's not big enough news,
Hasbro will be unveiling a brand new line

1279
01:29:26.041 --> 01:29:27.844
of Transformers merchandise next fall.

1280
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:34.255
We have a brand new line of
Decepticons, that is gonna be

1281
01:29:34.256 --> 01:29:36.393
- Hey fresh cake!
- Fresh cakes.

1282
01:29:37.527 --> 01:29:39.398
Fresh cakes ...

1283
01:29:41.067 --> 01:29:46.408
Comic Con fans, lets take a look at the
thrilling sissoreal with all our new exciting toys

1284
01:29:46.409 --> 01:29:47.879
Take a look.

1285
01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:56.159
Come on, there's an empty
supply room down the stairs.

1286
01:29:56.227 --> 01:29:57.630
Is that him?

1287
01:29:57.630 --> 01:30:00.831
Yes, there was an issue so he's
unconscious now but yeah, this is him.

1288
01:30:01.103 --> 01:30:02.837
Why did you bring him here?

1289
01:30:03.508 --> 01:30:07.380
Well I've been following him around since yesterday,
this was the only chance I could get him alone.

1290
01:30:07.381 --> 01:30:08.980
I had to move fast.

1291
01:30:09.117 --> 01:30:10.650
Hey Ted!

1292
01:30:11.655 --> 01:30:13.189
Is that you?

1293
01:30:13.325 --> 01:30:18.451
Yeah, he had a little to much to drink,
he puked a pile of cotton all over this little girl

1294
01:30:18.867 --> 01:30:20.802
so we're gonna take him back to sober him up.

1295
01:30:21.004 --> 01:30:23.408
- Ah, rock on Ted!
- FIA!

1296
01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:27.615
Be careful out there,
some nerds spilled their lunch.

1297
01:30:28.017 --> 01:30:30.020
Hey dont walk forward so fast man.

1298
01:30:36.766 --> 01:30:38.368
Hey Johnny.

1299
01:30:38.369 --> 01:30:39.370
Guy?

1300
01:30:39.371 --> 01:30:41.440
It's a God damn party here today.

1301
01:30:41.774 --> 01:30:43.843
I remember you from the wedding.

1302
01:30:43.844 --> 01:30:45.247
Did you do a nose job?

1303
01:30:45.248 --> 01:30:47.985
- No.
- Yes you did you fucking liar.

1304
01:30:47.985 --> 01:30:49.655
Hey, we just ran into your friend Ted.

1305
01:30:49.656 --> 01:30:50.857
Ted? Where is he?

1306
01:30:50.858 --> 01:30:53.661
Well, the got a little wasted so two
dudes took him out back to sober him up.

1307
01:30:53.728 --> 01:30:56.932
- Did you see which way they went?
- Yeah back hallway past the foodle both.

1308
01:30:56.933 --> 01:30:58.936
Come On!

1309
01:30:58.937 --> 01:31:00.539
Thirsty abnormal?

1310
01:31:01.543 --> 01:31:03.277
I fucking love this place.

1311
01:31:12.027 --> 01:31:13.361
What the fuck?

1312
01:31:13.362 --> 01:31:15.098
What the fuck is going on here?

1313
01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:16.501
Who the hell are you?

1314
01:31:16.502 --> 01:31:18.772
He really is extraordinary, isn't he?

1315
01:31:19.173 --> 01:31:21.014
You fucking bitch, this is a kidnapping!

1316
01:31:21.111 --> 01:31:22.646
No it's not.

1317
01:31:23.182 --> 01:31:25.384
Kidnapping only applies to people,

1318
01:31:25.585 --> 01:31:27.721
and you Ted, you're property.

1319
01:31:27.723 --> 01:31:29.656
Yeah, and so is that fucking hair piece.

1320
01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.799
What do you say? Happy face.

1321
01:31:34.869 --> 01:31:36.935
Right there, just me, yes!

1322
01:31:37.806 --> 01:31:39.675
Come on, alright.

1323
01:31:39.945 --> 01:31:42.546
Right there, yeah good.

1324
01:31:45.086 --> 01:31:46.820
Hey Bennet!

1325
01:31:47.758 --> 01:31:49.224
Oh shit!

1326
01:31:49.225 --> 01:31:52.030
You messed up my car,
what the hell is wrong with you?

1327
01:31:52.165 --> 01:31:54.702
Sam this is really a bad time, right,
something happened to Ted.

1328
01:31:54.703 --> 01:31:57.741
Oh, but it's a good time for you to vandalize my chrysler though.

1329
01:31:58.108 --> 01:32:00.179
Fuck your chrysler!

1330
01:32:09.797 --> 01:32:12.465
Holy shit! Donnie you do not want to do this!

1331
01:32:13.336 --> 01:32:15.206
You think about what happened to Frinway.

1332
01:32:15.274 --> 01:32:17.409
Remember? You cut me open and that's it.

1333
01:32:17.478 --> 01:32:19.278
I'm gone, dead.

1334
01:32:19.279 --> 01:32:22.483
Just a regular old teddy bear.
I won't be any fun then, will I?

1335
01:32:23.153 --> 01:32:25.422
This isn't about you Ted.

1336
01:32:25.423 --> 01:32:27.158
You're only one bear.

1337
01:32:27.294 --> 01:32:30.499
We-re gonna figure out what makes you real
and then we're gonna make millions of Teds.

1338
01:32:30.631 --> 01:32:32.701
One for every child in the world.

1339
01:32:33.106 --> 01:32:36.574
And one for me.

1340
01:32:36.575 --> 01:32:39.513
One that loves me just as much as you love John.

1341
01:32:39.715 --> 01:32:41.851
Look,  Donny, I could never love you.

1342
01:32:42.384 --> 01:32:45.055
Oh God that sounds fucked up.
Listen, I don't wanna die.

1343
01:32:45.391 --> 01:32:46.860
Okay, so...

1344
01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:50.866
What if I gave you a handjob outside
your pants while you're eating an ice cream?

1345
01:32:53.472 --> 01:32:55.273
I'll give you a minute.

1346
01:33:36.148 --> 01:33:37.948
Hey, check it out, nerd fight.

1347
01:34:06.066 --> 01:34:07.935
I'll see you in heaven, Ted.

1348
01:34:15.148 --> 01:34:17.019
- Ted!
- Johnny!

1349
01:34:17.152 --> 01:34:18.823
Who the hell are you?

1350
01:34:19.024 --> 01:34:20.558
Get away from him you bastard!

1351
01:34:20.826 --> 01:34:22.961
- Ted are ou okay buddy?
- Johnny thank God.

1352
01:34:22.962 --> 01:34:24.565
I'm out.

1353
01:34:24.633 --> 01:34:26.436
Please mr Jessup, don't go.
We can still do this.

1354
01:34:26.437 --> 01:34:29.172
You're on your own Danny.
I can't be implicated in any of this.

1355
01:34:29.174 --> 01:34:30.577
Wait, who are you?

1356
01:34:30.578 --> 01:34:32.446
I am working for Mattel.

1357
01:34:34.116 --> 01:34:35.719
You piece of shit!

1358
01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.855
Killing my family pup wasn't enough for you huh?

1359
01:34:37.856 --> 01:34:39.856
What are you gonna do now?

1360
01:34:39.925 --> 01:34:42.195
You don't deserve him Johnny, you never did.

1361
01:34:42.196 --> 01:34:45.267
- You never did!
- I've waited to do this for a long time.

1362
01:34:47.874 --> 01:34:49.842
Aha, I fucking knew it!

1363
01:34:50.144 --> 01:34:51.746
Come on.

1364
01:35:03.234 --> 01:35:04.637
Listen, Johnny.

1365
01:35:04.638 --> 01:35:06.440
I want to tell you how sorry I am.

1366
01:35:06.441 --> 01:35:10.446
No, forget about it. Look, you were upset Teddy,
I shouldn't have brushed it off. I'm so sorry.

1367
01:35:10.447 --> 01:35:12.383
No, no, listen to me.

1368
01:35:12.384 --> 01:35:14.120
You too Sam.

1369
01:35:14.121 --> 01:35:16.054
I acted like an asshole.

1370
01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:20.396
Alright? I was just hurting cause I knew I'd lost.

1371
01:35:20.998 --> 01:35:25.104
And that in the eyes of the
world I will always be property.

1372
01:35:25.272 --> 01:35:27.209
But you know what? Who gives a shit?

1373
01:35:27.210 --> 01:35:31.147
It doesn't matter what the world calls me.
I know who I am.

1374
01:35:31.417 --> 01:35:35.788
And that's all that's important,
and I know who my friends are.

1375
01:35:35.892 --> 01:35:39.028
And honest to God, if you two want to be together

1376
01:35:39.029 --> 01:35:42.502
- Nothing would make me happier.
- Oh, buddy I love you for that.

1377
01:35:42.503 --> 01:35:45.106
Thanks Ted, it means a lot.

1378
01:35:46.711 --> 01:35:50.582
And for what it's worth,
as far as I'm concerned

1379
01:35:50.717 --> 01:35:54.456
You're a person as much as
anybody else I've ever known.

1380
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:59.696
Oh Sam, that means the world comming
from someone who went to Arizona state.

1381
01:36:25.978 --> 01:36:27.582
Holy shit, Johnny!

1382
01:36:27.648 --> 01:36:28.918
Oh my God, John!

1383
01:36:28.919 --> 01:36:30.052
- Johnny?
- John?

1384
01:36:30.053 --> 01:36:31.255
- Oh Jesus.
- Are you okay?

1385
01:36:31.256 --> 01:36:32.989
Are you alright?

1386
01:36:33.193 --> 01:36:34.793
John, hey.

1387
01:36:35.196 --> 01:36:37.398
- What happened here?
- The rocket ship just hit him.

1388
01:36:37.399 --> 01:36:39.903
Jesus Christ, it's a starship Enterprise. Forget it.

1389
01:36:39.904 --> 01:36:41.806
Somebody call 911.

1390
01:36:41.807 --> 01:36:43.810
Johnny, come one, stay with me pal.

1391
01:36:43.811 --> 01:36:46.080
We need an ambulance at, 655 West 34.

1392
01:36:46.081 --> 01:36:48.283
- How the hell did it fall?
- I do not know!

1393
01:36:51.358 --> 01:36:52.626
It was him!

1394
01:36:52.627 --> 01:36:54.629
The guy that's dressed as a ninja turtle.

1395
01:36:59.106 --> 01:37:00.773
Which one?

1396
01:37:00.774 --> 01:37:03.979
Alright, two can play this Where's Aldo
shit you son of a bitch.

1397
01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.648
Sam, give me your phone.

1398
01:37:25.418 --> 01:37:29.319
That's him.

1399
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:33.764
Get off me!

1400
01:37:35.702 --> 01:37:38.773
Johnny? Johnny? Come on.

1401
01:37:39.108 --> 01:37:40.843
Jhony, you gotta wake up pal.

1402
01:37:41.445 --> 01:37:43.179
Johnny, wake up!

1403
01:37:43.248 --> 01:37:44.984
Wake up, Johnny.

1404
01:37:47.056 --> 01:37:51.328
Jhony, wake up!

1405
01:38:37.144 --> 01:38:39.880
How is he? Is he gonna come out of it?

1406
01:38:40.215 --> 01:38:43.252
I don't know, miss Jackson, we're doing everything we can.

1407
01:38:43.353 --> 01:38:45.223
It's all up to him now.

1408
01:38:55.511 --> 01:38:58.646
John, please wake up.

1409
01:39:07.866 --> 01:39:09.533
- Somebody help!
- Oh my God, John!

1410
01:39:11.002 --> 01:39:12.443
Hello? There's something happening.

1411
01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:14.207
Mr Bennet?

1412
01:39:14.208 --> 01:39:16.277
- Something is wrong.
- Whats going on? What's happening to him?

1413
01:39:16.278 --> 01:39:18.014
Mr Bennet? John?

1414
01:39:18.416 --> 01:39:20.484
We have a code blue in room 134!

1415
01:39:20.486 --> 01:39:22.288
- What does that mean?
- I'm sorry, you have to wait outside.

1416
01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:23.691
- What's going on?
- Is he gonna be okay?

1417
01:39:23.692 --> 01:39:26.696
The doctors will do everything they can
but I need you to go to the waiting area now.

1418
01:39:26.697 --> 01:39:28.232
Excuse me.

1419
01:39:28.233 --> 01:39:31.638
- What the status?
- He was stable a minute ago and now he's unresponsive.

1420
01:39:31.706 --> 01:39:33.574
He's not breathing and got no pulse.

1421
01:39:33.575 --> 01:39:36.856
Start contractions, prepare to intubate,
give him a milligram of Epinephrine.

1422
01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:07.902
I'm sorry.

1423
01:40:08.971 --> 01:40:10.908
He didn't make it.

1424
01:40:12.512 --> 01:40:13.978
What?

1425
01:40:14.381 --> 01:40:16.116
What?

1426
01:40:16.852 --> 01:40:18.520
It's Johnny?

1427
01:40:18.923 --> 01:40:22.059
If you'd like you can go in
and say you're goodbyes.

1428
01:41:02.464 --> 01:41:04.000
Johnny?

1429
01:41:06.138 --> 01:41:08.208
You're my thunder buddy.

1430
01:41:10.414 --> 01:41:12.881
My thunder buddy of life.

1431
01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:18.759
And you gave up your own life to save mine.

1432
01:41:22.168 --> 01:41:24.236
And I promise,

1433
01:41:26.175 --> 01:41:29.780
I don't know how my life works without you.

1434
01:41:33.854 --> 01:41:35.854
Goodbye John..

1435
01:41:38.396 --> 01:41:40.062
I got you mother fucker!

1436
01:41:41.466 --> 01:41:44.837
Holy shit, it's a zombie!
It's a fucking zombie!

1437
01:41:45.676 --> 01:41:47.477
I totally fucking got you!

1438
01:41:47.478 --> 01:41:50.751
- Holy shit!
- You should see your fucking face!

1439
01:41:50.819 --> 01:41:53.354
- You son of a bitch!
- That was fucking classic!

1440
01:41:53.355 --> 01:41:55.957
Wait, this is payback because
I made you believe I was dead.

1441
01:41:56.026 --> 01:41:58.565
- You did it this time!
- I did it this time!

1442
01:41:58.566 --> 01:42:00.498
Well done, well done.

1443
01:42:00.636 --> 01:42:02.503
Give me five! High five.

1444
01:42:02.504 --> 01:42:04.373
What the fuck is going on?

1445
01:42:04.441 --> 01:42:08.714
What's going on is this guy just
won the bullshit comedy blue ribbon.

1446
01:42:08.715 --> 01:42:11.051
You are the fucking greatest man.

1447
01:42:11.787 --> 01:42:13.657
How was the doctor in on it?

1448
01:42:13.658 --> 01:42:16.060
They got me out and I was totally
fine so I talked him into going along.

1449
01:42:16.061 --> 01:42:21.403
Hey doc, it worked out hilarious, thanks.
No problem, we're a funny hospital.

1450
01:42:21.605 --> 01:42:24.675
You asshole! You think this shit is funny?

1451
01:42:24.809 --> 01:42:28.349
Do you know how devastated I was?
I put a drowning smiley on facebook.

1452
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:31.420
How am I supposed to explain that to everybody?

1453
01:42:31.421 --> 01:42:35.193
Well you could change your relationship
status from single to it's complicated.

1454
01:42:35.896 --> 01:42:38.298
You're gonna have to do alot better than that!

1455
01:42:40.906 --> 01:42:43.507
Well...you're in a relationship with John Bennet.

1456
01:42:43.577 --> 01:42:47.848
Well....we'll have to talk about that.

1457
01:42:59.072 --> 01:43:01.874
Hey, if you two want to bang me
and Ted can totally leave the room.

1458
01:43:01.875 --> 01:43:04.745
No, honey,they're classy, they're not like us.

1459
01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:06.483
It's not that kind of people.

1460
01:43:06.484 --> 01:43:09.419
I'm happy to see everybody has made a full recovery..

1461
01:43:09.623 --> 01:43:10.824
- Mr Meighan?
- What the hell?

1462
01:43:10.825 --> 01:43:12.026
Holy shit.

1463
01:43:12.027 --> 01:43:13.696
Is it alright if I come in?

1464
01:43:13.697 --> 01:43:15.497
Sure, yeah.

1465
01:43:15.968 --> 01:43:17.701
How are you feeling, John?

1466
01:43:17.770 --> 01:43:19.371
I am alive.

1467
01:43:19.706 --> 01:43:23.210
You are very lucky.
I saw what you did on TV.

1468
01:43:23.245 --> 01:43:25.648
Yes, he saved my ass is what he did.

1469
01:43:25.650 --> 01:43:27.118
You know why?

1470
01:43:27.185 --> 01:43:31.326
Because he's a person. And no matter how many
smartass lawyers you're hiring to keep him down

1471
01:43:31.727 --> 01:43:33.930
they're not gonna change that, not in our eyes.

1472
01:43:34.399 --> 01:43:37.269
Teddy is real, aso you can go fuck yourself.

1473
01:43:38.272 --> 01:43:39.807
I will.

1474
01:43:40.343 --> 01:43:45.284
And as soon as I'm done fucking
myself I'd like to take your case Ted.

1475
01:43:45.686 --> 01:43:46.888
- What?
- Seriously?

1476
01:43:46.889 --> 01:43:48.490
- Oh my God!
- You hear that?

1477
01:43:51.163 --> 01:43:52.897
Well maybe we don't want you now.

1478
01:43:52.898 --> 01:43:55.436
- Shut up!
- No, no, we want you, for sure we want you.

1479
01:43:55.437 --> 01:43:57.305
What made you change your mind?

1480
01:43:57.305 --> 01:43:59.842
Well, when I saw what John did for you.

1481
01:44:00.312 --> 01:44:03.115
And he was willing to give his life for yours.

1482
01:44:03.316 --> 01:44:05.252
He gave me a kick in the ass.

1483
01:44:05.453 --> 01:44:08.859
It reminded me of why I chose to do what I do.

1484
01:44:09.861 --> 01:44:13.400
I'm sorry I turned you away.
I was wrong.

1485
01:44:14.269 --> 01:44:18.074
As far as I'm concerned, anyone who can inspire

1486
01:44:18.277 --> 01:44:21.881
that kind of love in another person
deserves to be called a human.

1487
01:44:23.219 --> 01:44:24.621
You mean it?

1488
01:44:24.622 --> 01:44:29.293
I certainly do. So, shall we get started?

1489
01:44:40.182 --> 01:44:42.719
What defines a person?

1490
01:44:44.257 --> 01:44:46.457
What defines property?

1491
01:44:47.194 --> 01:44:48.795
What's the difference?

1492
01:44:50.466 --> 01:44:54.806
The anthropologist and epitist Dawn Prince Hughes argues that

1493
01:44:55.142 --> 01:44:57.943
the fandus for personhood includes self awareness,

1494
01:44:59.017 --> 01:45:04.120
an ability to understand complex emotions,

1495
01:45:04.424 --> 01:45:07.162
and the capacity for empathy.

1496
01:45:08.832 --> 01:45:13.773
And we are all in agreement that Ted is self aware.

1497
01:45:16.445 --> 01:45:19.315
- What is your name?
- Ted Clubberlang.

1498
01:45:24.392 --> 01:45:27.714
As for the complex emotions and the capacity for empathy,

1499
01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:33.673
we all saw the distressing images of
Ted agonizing over his fallen friend

1500
01:45:33.675 --> 01:45:35.345
John Bennet.

1501
01:45:35.346 --> 01:45:42.053
In those images, Ted exhibits all of the
remaining qualities of personhood.

1502
01:45:44.227 --> 01:45:46.697
It's right there for anyone to see.

1503
01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:52.373
And I believe that a just court must
by definition grant basic human rights

1504
01:45:53.243 --> 01:45:57.214
to all those who deserve them.

1505
01:45:58.185 --> 01:46:03.593
Just add the Emancipation Proclamation and
the 13th amendment did so many years ago.

1506
01:46:07.202 --> 01:46:10.472
So ladies and gentlemen of the court.

1507
01:46:12.209 --> 01:46:14.477
I invite you

1508
01:46:15.549 --> 01:46:18.019
to change the world.

1509
01:46:37.321 --> 01:46:40.593
Well Johnny, this is the
second time you made me real

1510
01:46:40.928 --> 01:46:42.663
Thanks pal.

1511
01:46:42.664 --> 01:46:44.467
Hey, you were always real to me buddy,
even when you weren't.

1512
01:46:44.468 --> 01:46:47.269
Congratulations Ted.

1513
01:46:47.272 --> 01:46:48.940
Thanks Sam.

1514
01:46:53.883 --> 01:46:56.287
Ted?

1515
01:46:56.288 --> 01:46:58.490
This is quite a victory for you.

1516
01:46:58.491 --> 01:47:01.963
Is there any statement you would like
to make now that you are legally a person?

1517
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.367
Yes, there is.

1518
01:47:05.904 --> 01:47:08.240
Tami-Lynn McCafferty...

1519
01:47:08.241 --> 01:47:10.111
Will you marry me?

1520
01:47:11.768 --> 01:47:13.512
Yes!

1521
01:47:18.259 --> 01:47:21.529
And so our story comes to an end.

1522
01:47:21.598 --> 01:47:24.401
Ted and Tami-Lynn were married once again,

1523
01:47:24.668 --> 01:47:28.074
and soon afterwards they
adopted a fine young baby boy.

1524
01:47:29.479 --> 01:47:33.352
Johnny, meet your new godson,
Apollo Creed Clubberlang.

1525
01:47:34.088 --> 01:47:36.024
Aw Teddy, he's adorable.

1526
01:47:36.025 --> 01:47:38.094
Oh, and we got something for him too.

1527
01:47:38.361 --> 01:47:39.895
Oh shit, yeah.

1528
01:47:44.705 --> 01:47:46.174
Johnny!

1529
01:47:46.241 --> 01:47:48.044
Oh Johnny it's perfect.

1530
01:47:48.045 --> 01:47:52.117
And you know, maybe someday,
if you wish hard enough, maybe he'll come to life.

1531
01:47:52.385 --> 01:47:54.788
You can do all kinds of drugs together.

1532
01:47:54.857 --> 01:47:56.858
That is all I want for him.

1533
01:47:57.193 --> 01:48:00.065
Oh, it smells like someone's got a bobo diaper.

1534
01:48:00.399 --> 01:48:02.402
Teddy it's your turn to change it.

1535
01:48:02.403 --> 01:48:04.138
Oh yeah, no problem.

1536
01:48:04.874 --> 01:48:07.026
- Fuck me!
- What's the matter?

1537
01:48:07.027 --> 01:48:08.747
That can't be normal. He's gotta be sick.

1538
01:48:08.748 --> 01:48:10.951
He's not sick. It's just baby doodie.

1539
01:48:10.952 --> 01:48:13.689
- It's just what babies do Teddy.
- Oh, you don't think this diaper is gross?

1540
01:48:13.690 --> 01:48:15.223
- No!
- Alright, here, catch!

1541
01:48:15.826 --> 01:48:17.426
Teddy, what the fuck?

1542
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:21.035
Shit, you mother fucker!

1543
01:48:21.303 --> 01:48:23.972
Hashtag: Shit happens.
