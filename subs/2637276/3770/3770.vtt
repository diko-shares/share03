1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,598
Well, aren't you a fucking idiot!

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,100
What the fuck are you doing here?

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:21,103
- No, nothing...
- You looking for something, huh?

4
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,980
Take it easy, man.

5
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,733
- You've been having fun, huh?
- Chill, dude.

6
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,652
Grab him!

7
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,573
Look at me, punk!

8
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,410
- Hold him tight.
- Fuck him up!

9
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,007
Shit, my hand. Fucking pussy!

10
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,606
Make sure no one's looking!

11
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,368
There are blows in life...

12
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,788
...so great...

13
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,084
...I don't know.

14
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,134
Blows as if from the hatred of God.

15
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,681
As if before them, the backlash
of everything suffered...

16
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,433
...were to damn up the soul.

17
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,312
I don't know.

18
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,613
They are few, but they are.

19
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,285
They open dark furrows
in the fiercest face...

20
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,287
...and in the strongest side.

21
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,670
Perhaps they could be
the horses of barbarous Attilas...

22
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,300
...or the black heralds
Death sends us.

23
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,310
There are blows in life so great.

24
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,275
I don't know.

25
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:41,160
Lima. Sunday, 6a.m.
Two weeks before.

26
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,598
Who is it?

27
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,849
No one.

28
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,250
Hello, Santi, it's your father.

29
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,879
I'm sorry for having
to tell you like this...

30
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,883
Before your mother died, I...

31
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,385
I'm not sure how to say this.

32
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,099
Your mother left me for being a failure.

33
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,063
I didn't realize this
until after she died.

34
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,731
Forgive me.

35
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,736
You're a grown man now and...

36
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,739
...I know I have never been
a good father.

37
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,618
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

38
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,458
...I want you to know
that I love you, son.

39
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,757
Forgive me for leaving
you by yourself.

40
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,138
I have to go now.

41
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,058
Forgive me.

42
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,474
Hey, sir!
What are you doing?!

43
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,311
- C'mon, Santi, don't take so long.
- Yeah, yeah.. don't worry.

44
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,110
- How much longer?
- I'm almost there...

45
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,989
For fuck's sake!

46
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,034
- Santiago, who the hell keeps calling?
- Just leave it...

47
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,871
- Stop messing around...
- Mariana!  No, don't!

48
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,459
Hello? Yes, speaking...

49
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,128
Come again?

50
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,133
Santiago, what's the matter?

51
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,098
My father...

52
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,318
In the name of the Father, the Son,
the Holy Spirit, amen.

53
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,404
May the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ...

54
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,573
...the love of the Father...

55
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:18,580
...and the communion of the Holy Ghost,
may He be with your spirits.

56
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,421
- Pautrat? Santiago Pautrat?
- That's me...

57
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,423
Sign here, please.

58
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,676
Thank you.

59
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,930
Is this all of it?

60
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,625
The Black Heralds.

61
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,610
And with this track from The Vagabonds,

62
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,654
we have some spicy news for you.

63
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:19,159
The police determined that the reason
for the recent suicide of the...

64
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:24,289
'60s band's lead singer was
due to chronic depression and an...

65
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:28,543
...economic and personal trauma.

66
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,339
The 58 year-old lead singer,
Jean Pautrat...

67
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,382
lept off the Miraflores bridge...

68
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,928
...last Sunday, the 12th of July,
ending his life.

69
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,182
I don't k now if you remember,
but his wife of 10 years...

70
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,726
left him for a Spanish diplomat.

71
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,564
The town’s gossip said that was
the cause of the group's break up.

72
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,816
What a shame, right?
He being so talented and all.

73
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,444
"Vagabond leaps off bridge"

74
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,150
Hello, Santi. Santi?

75
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,029
It's me, Xime.

76
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,783
I see you're not in.

77
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,122
I just found out about your dad and...

78
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,874
...I'm so sorry.

79
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,459
I still can't believe it.

80
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:57,716
I really hope you're doing better.
I know it must be tough and all.

81
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,137
Everything here in New York is fine,
but we really miss you.

82
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,472
Inigo sends you a hug...

83
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,974
...and I a ton of kisses.

84
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,309
I'll call you back soon. Bye.

85
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,648
Based on your file...

86
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,025
...your academic
and social performance...

87
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,611
...leaves a lot to be desired, Pautrat.

88
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,826
How can I justify
a scholarship for you...

89
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,413
...if you haven't even paid
your academic insurance?

90
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,498
You come from
over four private schools...

91
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,751
...from which you've been expelled
for bad conduct.

92
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,711
Here you have
been suspended three times...

93
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,213
...for physical aggression
against other students.

94
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,800
Please.

95
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,011
I really need your help right now.

96
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,015
I'm going through very hard times...

97
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,518
...and yesterday I lost my job.

98
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,104
But according to your file,
you live with your father.

99
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,107
No, we no longer live together.

100
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,153
Why don't you look for
educational opportunities...

101
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,197
...in other institutions that are...

102
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,032
...more adjusted to your budget.

103
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,618
Maybe you weren't born
to be an economist, Pautrat.

104
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,706
Hey, leave a message
and I'll call ya!

105
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,292
Answer the phone!

106
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,839
- Chips, sir?
- No, thanks!

107
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,480
Sir...only five soles for this toy dog.

108
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,693
No...no, thank you. I'm good.

109
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,293
Son of a bitch!

110
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,924
Sir...

111
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:10,515
Sir, can I have twenty soles
of 90 octane gas, please.

112
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:53,016
Santiago!  No!  Leave him alone!
Stop being an animal!

113
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,644
You fucking whore!

114
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,063
I tried calling you!

115
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,857
Let go!

116
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,902
I tried calling you a hundred times,
but you never answered.

117
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,070
So you start dating some asshole?

118
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:41,940
Santi...are you there?
Pick up the phone.

119
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:49,989
It's me, Xime, again. I don't know
if you got my message yesterday.

120
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,366
Well, the thing is...

121
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,118
I mentioned to Inigo that it
would be good to come see you...

122
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,871
...and he thought it was a great idea.

123
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,875
I know it's a bit of a surprise,
but we'll be arriving on Thursday!

124
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,629
And Inigo says that
even though we’re just...

125
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,799
...brother and sister through marriage,
he's dying to meet you.

126
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,885
I also really wanna see you.

127
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,390
How long has it been?
Five or six years?

128
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,977
I think the last time
was at your mother's funeral.

129
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,730
Seems like only
sad times bring us together.

130
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,816
Hopefully we can change that.

131
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,319
Xime?

132
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,002
Guess who?

133
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,753
Xime!

134
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:53,886
- How are you?
- Better, doing better.

135
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,472
I'm so sorry
about your dad and all.

136
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,101
Don't worry about it,
I'm much better now. You?

137
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,023
Good, great.
Married as you can see.

138
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,524
Congrats!

139
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,153
You're so grown up!

140
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:14,532
Last time I saw you, you were
a 15-year-old squirt full of pimples.

141
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,784
Where is Inigo?

142
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,411
- Santiago...
- What's up?

143
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,460
- I'm so sorry about your father.
- Don't worry, I'm fine now.

144
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,296
How was your flight from New York?

145
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,422
Fine.

146
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,883
Well, I'm kind of jetlagged
with the time change and all...

147
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,303
- It's only one hour, Inigo.
- It was only a joke, Ximena.

148
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,429
Shall we?

149
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,222
- Got everything?
- Yeah!

150
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,481
Wow, your place is nice.

151
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,859
It needs a girl's touch,
but that can be fixed.

152
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,945
Yeah, it's quite...retro.

153
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,120
It belonged to my mother.
I moved in after high school.

154
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,122
Cool.

155
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,216
I've prepared my bedroom for you.
The bed is big and...

156
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,011
...I just changed the sheets,
and there's also clean towels.

157
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,471
Let me know if you need anything.

158
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,474
- And you, where do you sleep?
- On the sofa.

159
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,311
You can close this door if you want.

160
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:30,024
- You're going to sleep there?
- Yeah, I always pass out there anyways.

161
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,527
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, don't worry.

162
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:38,241
- Smells good.
- I got you a welcoming chifa.

163
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,326
- Delicious!
- Chifa?

164
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,121
I hope it's not too cold.

165
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,502
- What the hell is chifa?
- Chinese-Peruvian food, my love.

166
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,046
- You owe me for this one.
- Please.

167
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,091
Hey, Santi, where's the bathroom?

168
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,802
Over here.

169
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,028
This is in Mancora, right?

170
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,992
I used to love going on these trips.

171
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,832
How'd it go? How'd the song go?

172
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:32,920
If the queen of Spain were to die

173
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,380
Charles V. would...

174
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,382
C'mon, help me.
I don't remember.

175
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:41,429
Then Charles V. would want
to rule and Spanish blood

176
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,515
Would spill and flow
like the waves flow in the sea

177
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,394
I can't believe I still remember!

178
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,271
How's the chifas?

179
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,607
Chifa, without the "s".

180
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,028
All right, guys,
let's set the table.

181
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,615
Can I have one?

182
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,746
- Just one.
- No, no.

183
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,257
Shame I missed the wedding.
Would've loved to have gone.

184
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,970
Well, you really didn't miss much.
It was a small wedding.

185
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,265
- Intimate.
- Intimate.

186
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:32,480
- I still haven't told you how we met.
- No, don't think so.

187
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:38,486
After one long year in New York,
I was finally able to do an exhibition.

188
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,031
And this nut came in
and bought the entire show.

189
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:46,869
It wasn’t gentry.
Her show was spectacular.

190
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,957
- What can I say, she's talented.
- You're such an idiot!

191
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,210
And you? Any plans?

192
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,925
I was thinking about going on a trip.
Taking a little break from Lima.

193
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:06,681
- Cool. Where are you going?
- Mancora.

194
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:12,228
Mancora? What a great idea.

195
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,605
Yeah... I leave tomorrow.

196
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:18,901
Tomorrow?

197
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,826
But...you don't want to spend
some time with us?

198
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,621
Thing is, I already had it
planned for some time now.

199
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,457
So you're leaving?

200
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:39,338
Baby, leave him alone.
Santi, go ahead with your plans.

201
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,883
It's a shame.

202
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:48,306
I was really looking forward
to spending some time with you.

203
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,310
I feel real bad. You guys can
stay here as long as you like.

204
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,521
I'm going to leave you a set of keys.

205
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,356
Santi, don't worry about us, really.

206
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,445
Thanks, but don't worry about it.

207
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:07,408
Well, maybe we can see you
when you return?

208
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,413
Well, I think I'm off to the shower.

209
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,332
I'll pick this up.

210
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,083
Don't worry about it...

211
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,669
You guys take the rest.

212
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,904
Thanks.

213
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,407
Not even a five-star hotel
treats us this well.

214
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,577
Are you okay?

215
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,373
Yeah.

216
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,546
I really need to get out of
Lima for a couple of days.

217
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:12,640
All this, the winter and all,
it's suffocating me a bit.

218
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,359
I think that’s kind of
the reason why my mother left.

219
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,782
No one knows about this, but...

220
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,414
...my father...

221
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,418
...just before he jumped,
he called me...

222
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,048
...and I didn't even answer.

223
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,760
I hadn't seen him for...

224
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,056
...six months...

225
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,516
...and I didn't even pick up.

226
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,020
My father killed himself
because of me.

227
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,899
He didn't kill himself because of you.

228
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,236
That was his decision.

229
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,658
I hadn't seen him in six months,
I had to wait till his funeral.

230
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,243
No, Santi, please.

231
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,063
What are you doing here so early?

232
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,982
Someone's in a mood.

233
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,156
Since you don't want
to spend time with us here...

234
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,742
...I've decided
we'll do it in Mancora.

235
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,119
- Are you serious?
- Yup.

236
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,079
You're leaving Inigo here?

237
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,789
The hell with leaving Inigo here!

238
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,833
Inigo goes to Mancora.

239
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,585
Open up, it's cold!

240
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,004
- You don't mind, right?
- No, of course not.

241
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,590
Open up!  I'm freezing!

242
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,676
Open!  Before I freeze!

243
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,515
- Leave it.
- You got it?

244
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,600
They're your things, anyway.

245
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,810
Open the trunk, this weighs a ton!

246
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:17,866
Hey, you, if you're going to be
so serious, stop and I'll get off.

247
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,414
C'mon, gimme a little smile...

248
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,836
Hey, Santi, what type of
music did your dad sing?

249
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,922
You're speaking too loud!

250
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,384
Sorry. So what kind of
music did your dad sing?

251
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,344
You know, old-school stuff...

252
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,596
Ballads?

253
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,641
No, a bit more funky, you know?

254
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,977
Like the Puma?

255
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,854
What Puma?

256
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:51,692
Shit, dude, the Puma. You know...
Jose Rodriguez! The Puma.

257
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,214
Thanks.

258
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,966
I'll have another one, please.

259
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,808
Look how cute those kids are.

260
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,485
Do you mind taking off your sunglasses?
I can't see your eyes.

261
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,659
What's wrong?

262
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,997
Nothing.

263
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,461
Inigo, I told you
not to come if you didn't want to.

264
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:56,382
Xime, please, be grateful
for the effort, huh?

265
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,343
Effort?

266
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,347
Effort is what I do for you.

267
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:12,147
People don't change.
Get that into your head.

268
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,737
Anyway, let's try to enjoy ourselves.

269
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:25,703
- Wow, the food looks great!
- It's all for you...all of it!

270
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,388
Why didn't you stop?

271
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,560
- Why should I stop?
- Because they were asking for help.

272
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,981
And why should I stop to help
the first asshole whose car breaks down?

273
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,025
Because that's what people do.

274
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,364
Maybe in Madrid or New York,
but not here.

275
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,914
I don't get it.
That's the mentality of a child.

276
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,835
Child...right.

277
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,549
Who helps you?

278
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,926
Who helps me?

279
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,846
Who helped me
when my mother left?

280
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,930
Nobody.

281
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,349
Who helped me when
my father decided one morning...

282
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,185
...to throw himself
off a goddamn bridge?

283
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,896
No one, because no one helps!

284
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,315
That's life. Everyone
has to survive on their own.

285
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,276
I take care of myself.

286
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,362
I'm sure they will too,
so don't worry for them so much.

287
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,660
I agree with Santi.

288
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,829
Fuck 'em.

289
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,666
Survival of the fittest.

290
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,919
You're a lot like me, Santi.

291
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,129
A lot.

292
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,470
How are you doing in school?

293
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,805
At my pace...

294
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,809
...I think I'm going to end up
being a singer like my dad.

295
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:18,690
- Don't wanna be an economist?
- I was told I'm not cut out for it.

296
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,739
- Inigo!
- What?

297
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:30,786
- Couldn't you piss somewhere else?
- Where the hell else? Sorry!

298
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,163
Excuse me,
may I take a picture of you?

299
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,000
So what are you up to? Working?

300
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,379
- I did.
- Doing what?

301
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,797
I was a waiter.

302
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,301
And? What, they fired you?
Like a dog.

303
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,637
Well, thank God that
I've never been fired from a job.

304
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,889
Because you haven't
worked a day in your life.

305
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,766
Thank God!

306
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,061
So why'd they fire you?

307
00:30:56,145 --> 00:31:00,148
My boss made some jokes about
my father that weren't very funny.

308
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,569
- And?
- I knocked him out.

309
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,529
Fuck him.

310
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,240
Leibovitz. Let's go!

311
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:11,034
- Let's go!
- Thanks!

312
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,457
Where have you been?
Your shirt is filthy with grease!

313
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,501
Leave me alone.
You fucked up my piss.

314
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,752
Hey, guys.

315
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,213
Excuse me, can you please...

316
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,966
...tell me exactly where we are?

317
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,888
Well, somewhere
in between Lima and Mancora.

318
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,556
- You're going to Mancora?
- Yup.

319
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,600
I'm also going to Mancora.

320
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,396
Can I get a lift?

321
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,026
Yeah, sure, why not?

322
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,028
Great!  Thanks!

323
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,488
My name is Andres,
but my friends call me Batoe.

324
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,573
Batoo?

325
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:53,076
- Batoe, with an accent on the "u."
- Oh, Batoe.

326
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:58,498
- I'm Ximena.
- How are you?

327
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:03,086
The smiling fellow over there
is Santi...

328
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,713
...and that's Inigo, my husband.

329
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,925
- Hey, bro.
- Broooo.

330
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,009
Shall we?

331
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,345
One sec, I'm going
to go get my surfboard.

332
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,930
Don't rush.
We'll wait for you in the car.

333
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,808
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

334
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,977
Seems like a nice guy, no?

335
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:23,065
- Is he coming with us the whole way?
- Yeah, till Mancora, so?

336
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,149
So Bohemian.

337
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,151
Jackass.

338
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,365
- Hey, leave that song on.
- All right!

339
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,742
- So you're Cuban?
- I'm "Cungo."

340
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:37,496
- Cungo?
- Cubano-Gringo.

341
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,750
- I've never heard of that.
- Just made it up.

342
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,630
- Do you guys mind?
- Ah...weed?

343
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,841
- You speak Portuguese don't you?
- No, but I do speak weed.

344
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:56,765
- So why do they call you Batoe?
- Because I'm the reincarnation of Batoe.

345
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,850
- You know who Batoe is right?
- Nope.

346
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:02,980
He was the creator of Kung Fu,
500 years before Christ.

347
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,692
- So you do karate?
- No, no.

348
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,320
How long have you been traveling for?

349
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,738
A long time.

350
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,032
I left Rio de Janeiro over a year ago.

351
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,036
And you've come from Rio hitchhiking?

352
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,999
That's right. And since
what counts is the journey...

353
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,377
...and not the destination,
may the road be welcomed.

354
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,880
What?

355
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,717
Nothing...Our Batoe is all talk.

356
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,427
Why?

357
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,513
"What counts is the journey
not the destination"? What?

358
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,850
The world isn't as fucked up
as you imagine it to be, Santi.

359
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,770
The world, as I observe it...

360
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,691
...my little grasshopper,
is how you see it and...

361
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,819
...and more than that,
how you want it to be.

362
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,237
Amen!

363
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,407
- That's some good weed, right?
- Amazing!

364
00:33:55,491 --> 00:34:00,162
But this isn't the weed talking...
it's the voice of the Shaman.

365
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,336
The Masters of the Ayahuasca.

366
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,797
What the hell is Ayahuasca?

367
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,633
It's a beverage that the indigenous
people take in Peru.

368
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,760
In Brazil too.

369
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,636
Where can we score some?

370
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,888
You'd have to go to the Amazon.

371
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,390
But you might find it in Mancora.

372
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,934
Piura is Peru's Shaman capital.

373
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,104
Ayahuasca is not a game.
It's not peyote or San Pedro.

374
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,981
It's much stronger.

375
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,777
Supposedly it's a ritual that converts
you into the animal you carry inside.

376
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,696
Ayahuasca is much more than that.

377
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,449
It puts you face to face
with your demons.

378
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:42,996
For some, it's the answer
to all their problems... understand?

379
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,414
Cool!

380
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,145
Shit!  No music.

381
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,856
- Nothing, huh?
- Just crappy news.

382
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,942
- Give it a rest?
- Kill it.

383
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,622
The longest wave in the world.

384
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,709
Understand?

385
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,379
No! Can't understand
a damn word you speak.

386
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,547
Chicama.

387
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,217
It's the beach with the longest
surf break in the world.

388
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,554
- Get out of here!
- No joke, dude.

389
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:45,058
It's a tube of water, two meters high
and two kilometers long.

390
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,476
Perfection.

391
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,387
I don't get it.

392
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,390
Me neither.

393
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,478
Brazil!

394
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,398
That wave is phenomenal!

395
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,736
Two meters...

396
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,656
Longest wave in the world, huh?

397
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,324
Where've you been, baby?

398
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,827
Craziest wave I've seen in my life.
Hey, we're spending the night.

399
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,537
You have to come see it!

400
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,790
- Sorry, man, but I'm going to Mancora.
- Fuck, one night?

401
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,043
I can't stay. If I do,
I'll lose the hotel reservation.

402
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,171
Okay, whatever,
you go to Mancora.

403
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:42,342
So how about it?
We stay here, you and me?

404
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,718
What?

405
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,136
I don't understand you, Inigo.

406
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,638
What? What don't you get?

407
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:50,475
C'mon, what the hell is wrong?

408
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,518
Fight?

409
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,520
Fight!  Yes!
Ximena loves to fight!

410
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,105
- And where do you plan on staying?
- In a hotel.

411
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,065
- And the board? Where are you gonna...
- I'll rent it!

412
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,817
They don't rent boards here.

413
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,193
Well, I'll rent Batoe's.

414
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,862
- Batoe?
- It's not for sale, brother.

415
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,448
No, no. Not sale, rent.
I give you money...

416
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,953
Help me out here, man.

417
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,663
Gift.

418
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,875
A gift? Great!

419
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,961
- Brother?
- Yeah!

420
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,717
So you're leaving?
I can't believe it.

421
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,052
That's enough!  Please!

422
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,889
Let's go, Xime!

423
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,558
That's enough!  Please!

424
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,103
- C'mon!  What are you doing?
- Let's go.

425
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,817
- Thanks, man!
- You're welcome.

426
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,402
So that's it?

427
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,486
You coming?

428
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,826
Later, guys!

429
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,748
Let's go. That's it!
Move, I'm driving.

430
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:58,168
- You sure?
- The hell with it!  Batoe let's go!

431
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,929
I hate those impulse reactions he gets.
Guy's addicted to adrenaline.

432
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:14,434
He shoots it up, eh?

433
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,321
You smoke a ton.

434
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,371
How old are you again?
20? 21?

435
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,582
21.

436
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,421
- You're such a little squirt.
- Shut up.

437
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,018
Xime, honestly...
what are you doing here?

438
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,437
I wanted to see you.

439
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,917
That's it!  Almost got it!

440
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,590
Easy does it!

441
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,637
Do you need a hand?

442
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,477
- C'mon!  We got it!
- Easy, sir.

443
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:34,073
- Thanks, kid!  How can I repay you?
- Not necessary, sir.

444
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:38,828
How about a lift?
I'm on my way out...

445
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,747
- Sure...why not?
- Great!

446
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,330
Hey, are my panties there?

447
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,123
No clue.

448
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,880
They're right here.
You didn't even look.

449
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,140
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

450
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,643
C'mon, perv!  Hit the shower.

451
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,158
- How's it going?
- Xime is almost ready.

452
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:03,871
- Ready?
- Nearly. Five minutes.

453
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,834
So where's the party?

454
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,753
In the next town over, "El Alto."

455
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,171
Hemingway used to live there.

456
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,049
Sounds good, huh?

457
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,595
Can I have a drag?

458
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,102
- I thought you weren't allowed to.
- How funny.

459
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,277
Five seconds, right?

460
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,323
Yes.

461
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,375
- Hey how are you?
- Good, and you?

462
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,793
Guys, this is "El Mono."

463
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,463
Welcome, folks!

464
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,757
Let's go!

465
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,931
Damn, this tonazo is sick,
partna'!

466
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,770
Tonazo? What language
are you speaking?

467
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,398
In Peruvian, sweetie,
tonazo means party. Dig it?

468
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,526
- Dig it?
- Dig it means get it.

469
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,906
Let's get a couple of cold ones.

470
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,157
It will loosen you up.

471
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,408
That's our stop.

472
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,329
Some beers would be nice!

473
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:31,250
Hey, ma'am, some iced icicle ones,
as if they were for you.

474
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,503
Iced icicle?
You're screwing me up, Mono!

475
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,005
Whatever, it's all good.
You order, I'm buying.

476
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:40,426
- No way. I wanna buy.
- Then you buy all the rounds!

477
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,846
As long as they're icy icicle,
I'm buying!

478
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,057
Check it out!

479
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,464
Baby, are you bored?

480
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,886
What's wrong? Now you want
to dance with that clown?

481
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,557
Yeah, would it bother you?

482
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:32,895
You think I'm an idiot? I may not
be from the city, but I'm no idiot!

483
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,185
Watch it, bitch!

484
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:57,438
- Easy. What's your problem?
- Had to be a city faggot.

485
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,857
Hey, what's your problem, huh?

486
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,360
Who the fuck are you calling
a city faggot, you fucking Indian!

487
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,339
Bitch-ass city boy!

488
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,853
I wonder what would've been of me
if I'd have lived in Mancora.

489
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,191
What's so funny?

490
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:51,367
I would have set up a little bar.
Would take my pictures...

491
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,371
...and would be completely free.

492
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,541
But then you wouldn't have met Inigo.

493
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,216
If it weren't for Inigo,
my life would've gone to shit.

494
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,720
Why?

495
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,810
After your mom passed...

496
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,230
...my dad split and abandoned me.

497
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:28,279
I got my things and took off
to New York to see if...

498
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:33,743
...I don't know, do something
with my photography.

499
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:41,375
Once there, I met some guy,
a photographer and...

500
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,421
...it was a disaster...

501
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:51,093
...I got myself into a hole.

502
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,767
And just like that, I met Inigo.

503
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,731
He was there,
took care of me, and...

504
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,861
...I guess...

505
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,780
...I fell in love with him.

506
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:20,122
And now I feel as if
I'm lost in his world.

507
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,292
What world?

508
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,879
Huh?

509
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,297
What world?

510
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:39,642
In Inigo's. He doesn't give two shits,
does what he wants, and...

511
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,897
...it frightens me.

512
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,986
You know?

513
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,660
To be honest, it's a bit deep for me.

514
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,504
I should've moved here.

515
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,012
- C'mon!
- What are you doing?

516
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,058
C'mon, Santi!

517
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,509
Going to Mancora?

518
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,584
It's not bad.

519
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,045
Hello.

520
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,136
What are you doing here?
How'd you know we were here?

521
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,388
Batoe.
I ran into him last night.

522
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,933
- Last night?
- Yeah, last night.

523
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,561
- Hey, gimme a sec.
- Sure.

524
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,691
Forgive me.

525
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:22,072
I saw the wave, got excited,
and threw one of my famous tantrums.

526
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,658
No worries.

527
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,119
I missed you.

528
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,413
- How was Chicama?
- Amazing!

529
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:33,292
And I rented this beauty!
What do you think, Santi?

530
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,294
Bad-ass!

531
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,838
Hey, what happened to you?
You look like--

532
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:41,383
We went to some party
in the town next over and...

533
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,303
...and this one started fooling around
with some girl and almost got beat up.

534
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,181
She fooled around with me
and there was no beating...

535
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,724
Well, did you fuck her?

536
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:56,106
No, he just got wasted and I found him
passed out on the beach...

537
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,609
...and waited for him to wake up,
and ended up sleeping there...

538
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,152
So you two slept, together?

539
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,198
Yeah, I just couldn't move him.

540
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,282
Is this sand?

541
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:09,453
Yeah, I just drank too much
and got sick.

542
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,540
I'm gonna go ahead
to the bathroom. See you in a bit.

543
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:18,837
I missed you.
Forgive me, I'm an ass.

544
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,173
It's a cool car.

545
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:25,970
Yeah, right. Hey and Batoe?
I've got his board.

546
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,099
These beers are hot as shit!  Hey!

547
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:36,814
Professor!  Commander!  Boss!

548
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:41,986
Hey, what's wrong with this asshole?
He missing a nut?

549
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,570
He's concentrated on the game.

550
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,000
That tattoo?

551
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:02,047
Her idea, you know.
"Get a tattoo for me."

552
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,342
Stupid move.

553
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,346
I love kids.

554
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:15,394
Do you guys plan on having one?

555
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:18,105
At the moment,
Ximena prefers not to, but...

556
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:24,945
...it's best, I guess. There's
enough people that hate me already.

557
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,991
Ximena always says,
"It isn't hate, it’s jealousy."

558
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:32,870
But it's hatred all right.
It's different, you know?

559
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,081
- And you?
- Me what?

560
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,002
You got a girl, or are you a fag?

561
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,881
I had one, but she turned out
to be a whore.

562
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,134
They're all whores!
My grandmother was a whore...

563
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,512
...my mother was a whore,
me, I'm a son of a whore!

564
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,056
One whore more, one whore less...

565
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,640
...doesn't matter.

566
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:54,808
Hey, pay attention.

567
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,686
What matters is what's fucked,

568
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,938
because no one can take that
away from you.

569
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:08,322
What's with you?
You look really pensive.

570
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:15,371
These beers are really warm.
Sir, these beers are too hot!

571
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:18,290
That's all that's left.
You two drank 'em all!

572
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,875
Suck on this.

573
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,545
Let's go.

574
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,242
May I?

575
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:02,626
- Where are you from?
- Cabo Blanco.

576
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,921
- What are your names?
- Vicente Gacindo.

577
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,132
Thanks, Vicente.

578
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,259
Thanks, Carmen.

579
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,189
You don't look too good, bro.

580
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:08,984
What's wrong?

581
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:14,781
Wow, wow, stop, stop now.
This guy's gonna puke!  Go get out!

582
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,410
Don't trip!

583
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,080
Faggot!

584
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,168
Hey, that fish is a real beauty.

585
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:29,671
Yes, thanks.
That's my cousin.

586
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:33,175
- Fisherman?
- Yeah.

587
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,510
And him?

588
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,929
- That's my dad.
- Yeah, you look alike.

589
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:37,971
Right.

590
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:41,183
And this is my uncle,
the Shaman.

591
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,646
A real one? Because
I want to visit one, but...

592
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:50,526
...I don't want to wake up and realize
I'm missing a kidney, you know?

593
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:55,072
- No. No, sir, he's a real one.
- Real one, huh?

594
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,909
- You're not Peruvian, are you?
- Gringo.

595
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,207
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Likewise.

596
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,709
Hey, Santi, this guy speaks English!

597
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,382
Let me see. You look horrible.
Let's go!

598
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,488
So, partner, the Shamans,
where do they live?

599
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:41,493
Well, they live in the desert.
Many tourists see them for San Pedro.

600
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,998
No, no. I'm not interested
in San Pedro or Peyote.

601
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,708
I'm looking for ayahuasca.

602
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:50,752
That's hard to find
around here, sir.

603
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,671
- You can't hook me up?
- No, sir, not me.

604
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:56,216
You should travel to the bush.
There's many there.

605
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,636
What's that you get there? Braces?

606
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,809
One's gotta better their smile, right?

607
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,987
Hey, baby!

608
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:25,120
Okay, Sonia, sounds great!
Big hug and thanks!

609
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:29,166
- Who was that?
- You’re jealous, huh?

610
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,127
- Me?
- It's a surprise.

611
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,257
A surprise, huh?

612
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,596
We have everything?

613
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,477
Now this is a house!
What do you think?

614
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,229
Looks cool.

615
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,732
It's more than cool,
it's out of control!

616
01:00:55,985 --> 01:01:01,239
- How did you get it?
- Little secret. Like it?

617
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:07,204
Santi, that's you down there,
and this room is ours.

618
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,998
You're gonna love this.

619
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,335
A little basket for your apples.

620
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,089
How cool.

621
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,840
It's great, babe.

622
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,211
Hey, city boy, why the long face?

623
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,299
What, did the "Indian" frighten you?

624
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,468
A bit, I guess.

625
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:47,804
What you got there?

626
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,516
This?

627
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:55,020
What? You smoke?

628
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,440
Once in a blue moon, I guess.

629
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:07,657
Well, this one's pretty much dead...

630
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,201
...but if you want...

631
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:12,704
...we can go over to a friend's,
where we'll surely find more.

632
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,581
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

633
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,376
Let's do it.

634
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,839
They call me "La Chachi."

635
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:44,945
You only have
the look of a burnout, huh?

636
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:49,074
Yeah, I really don't smoke much.

637
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,703
It's good shit, right?

638
01:03:54,997 --> 01:04:00,710
So where's the fam? You look
pretty chill smoking around the crib.

639
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:06,299
My dad's in Punta Sal
and my sister is with Chicho.

640
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,009
They get back tomorrow.

641
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,221
You can tell they don't
know your snobby ass.

642
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,058
What's so funny?

643
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,520
Funny, that's all.

644
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,567
I forgot your name.

645
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,988
My name? Santiago.

646
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,787
And what the hell
are you doing here?

647
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,539
Looking for something.

648
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,672
- I guess escaping from life.
- Shut up!  You're boring me.

649
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:55,098
Let's do something fun tonight,
perhaps party at my house.

650
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:58,727
- Cool.
- Obviously, it's my idea, idiot.

651
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,480
So, party tonight?

652
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,783
- Hello.
- Hello.

653
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,119
- You open yet?
- Yeah, what do you want?

654
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,997
- A beer.
- Sure, come in.

655
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:07,504
Thanks. So where are you from?

656
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,633
Where do you think? Mexico!

657
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,010
Good deal.

658
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,137
What's up, man?

659
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,557
- Good night.
- Hey!

660
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,142
I want a Mexican michelada.

661
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,271
Michelada coming right up!

662
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,323
And that?

663
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:38,952
- What? This?
- Yes, that.

664
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:40,745
It's a secret.

665
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,748
Sounds interesting. What is it?

666
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:49,379
Didn't your mommy teach you
that curiosity killed the cat?

667
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,439
- Hey there!
- Hello to the two of you.

668
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,441
- And you are?
- I'm Inigo.

669
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,652
I'm Ana Maria,
and this is "La Chachi."

670
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,737
Hello.

671
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:17,741
And you? Left your
tongue at my place?

672
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,871
- We already met.
- You're a quick one, huh?

673
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:26,583
Anyway, there's a party
at my house tonight and...

674
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:29,753
...you're all super invited.

675
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,092
You're coming with us.

676
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,788
Look who’s here!
My little grasshopper!

677
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,418
Okay, just a little drag.

678
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,171
What, you don't say hi to me or what?

679
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,255
Sorry.

680
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,800
Puff, puff, pass, homey.

681
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:22,514
- Thanks, Mono, such a gent.
- As always. You wound me, Xime.

682
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,435
Where's Inigo?

683
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,773
No clue. He left to the kitchen
awhile ago and never came back.

684
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:08,143
- How's it going, cheater?
- Cheater?

685
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,855
Wanna do a little cheating with me?

686
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,032
I'm saying it because you never
mentioned you had a girlfriend.

687
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,576
And I don't.

688
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,663
Why, you want to be my girlfriend?

689
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:29,956
Yeah?

690
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,086
Okay, but we better run it
by my wife first.

691
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:43,011
- You're an asshole.
- Yup.

692
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:55,982
So how was hanging with Inigo?

693
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:59,152
Fine.

694
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:04,741
- Yeah? He wasn't a pest?
- No not at all. All good.

695
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,037
What's wrong?

696
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:21,507
- Xime, what happened...
- Don't worry, it's okay.

697
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:23,509
It happened.

698
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,553
On the contrary...

699
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:30,266
...I don't regret it.

700
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:40,777
Nor do I.

701
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:46,824
- What?
- Nothing.

702
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,620
What's with you?

703
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:53,331
Me? I'm fine. You?

704
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,252
- I'm fine.
- And you, Santi, everything okay?

705
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:05,510
Hey, quick question.

706
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,638
Your dad,
was he really famous or not?

707
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:11,349
- C'mon, drop it.
- I wanna know.

708
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,893
- No worries.
- It's unnecessary.

709
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,145
Why keep mourning, right?

710
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,564
So was he famous or what?

711
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:19,732
Inigo, drop it!

712
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,109
Yeah, you can say that.

713
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:27,073
So what was his biggest hit
from the top Peruvian top 20?

714
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,410
Sing it for me. Sing it.

715
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:32,954
Sing!

716
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:41,546
Tonight it rains like never,
and I don't have a desire to live

717
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,132
Heart of mine

718
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,637
Yeah, great song.
C'mon, I wanna dance!

719
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,682
That's the most popular.

720
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:06,029
You were looking for something,
weren't you?

721
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:17,957
So look.

722
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,444
I think I need another one.

723
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,572
- Another whiskey!
- No more whiskey!

724
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:51,282
Water, water.

725
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,825
Water doesn't exist.

726
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,786
Water with whiskey!

727
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,462
And you? What's on your mind?

728
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,714
That you fucked Ximena.

729
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:10,134
Who?

730
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:14,722
My wife. Your sister.

731
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:18,393
- You're crazy, man.
- Crazy am I?

732
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:22,730
What are you talking about?

733
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:27,151
You, you're a gullible fucker!

734
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,320
Look at that little scared look.

735
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,739
- You look suspicious as shit!
- You're crazy.

736
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,325
Now I'm fucking worried.
Your brother is an idiot.

737
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,828
- Why?
- Trust me, he is one.

738
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:39,163
Gimme a little drag.

739
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,333
- Enough with the cigarettes.
- Drop it, it's a party.

740
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,710
She's got a French complex.

741
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,337
Go ahead take it from her.

742
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:50,842
- Relax.
- Hey, kid, you relax.

743
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,428
Stay out of it. It's between us two.

744
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:56,681
Later.

745
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,434
Why are you always bitching
about the cigarettes?

746
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:03,396
Because I don't like you
smoking so much.

747
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,356
So drop it, then.

748
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,441
Drop it.

749
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:09,193
Drop it!

750
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:17,285
I have a little proposition for you.

751
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:19,454
What?

752
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,957
Remember what we did in Mallorca?

753
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,049
Who is she?

754
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,136
Look.

755
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,555
That's her.

756
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,516
It's all ready.

757
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:48,483
- When were you planning on telling me?
- I'm telling you now.

758
01:14:55,782 --> 01:14:58,784
I told you I would never do that again.

759
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,997
And with her?

760
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,376
You're a pig!

761
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:42,662
I was looking for you.
Come, we have a surprise for you.

762
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,800
Look who I found.

763
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,142
Hey there.

764
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,901
- What's the plan?
- We're playing squash. Wanna join us?

765
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,424
Too bad your wife couldn't join us.

766
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,677
I really liked her.

767
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:07,640
Forget my wife.

768
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,117
Hey there!

769
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:53,120
What are you doing here?

770
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,458
Couldn't sleep.

771
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:04,799
No clue.

772
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:07,384
He hasn't come home yet.

773
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,806
- Xime, what's wrong?
- I'm fine.

774
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,100
In the end, you're like all the rest.

775
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:19,063
Hey, if you’ve had a fight
with Inigo, leave me out of it.

776
01:20:21,024 --> 01:20:23,317
And you're a saint?

777
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:26,737
No, I never said I was a saint, but...

778
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,200
...at least I don't
go around using people.

779
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:32,493
What?

780
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:37,414
C'mon, stop pretending.
You know exactly why you're here.

781
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,999
You're using me.

782
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:40,960
You're using me...

783
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:44,213
...to get away from your shitty life.

784
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:45,923
And you're not?

785
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:49,593
- That's life, right?
- That's life?!

786
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,804
What the hell do you know about life?

787
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:55,516
You're nothing more than a little snot
who can't wipe his own ass.

788
01:20:57,143 --> 01:20:58,519
Well, maybe you're right...

789
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:02,690
...but at least it's not me who takes it
in the ass and has to say, "How nice! "

790
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:15,536
Fuck off!

791
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:48,903
Hey, Santi, welcome man.

792
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,757
Where have you been?

793
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,766
I thought we didn't ask
each other those questions.

794
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:41,622
Until when are you
staying in Mancora?

795
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,208
Not sure.

796
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:48,379
How's your search coming along?

797
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:58,639
One cannot run away
from his problems.

798
01:22:58,723 --> 01:23:02,726
One thinks that the problem
is those around him...

799
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:06,897
...and doesn't realize that
the problem is in fact oneself.

800
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:10,359
Just like I told you...

801
01:23:10,443 --> 01:23:14,154
...the world is however you want it
to be, my little grasshopper.

802
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,491
And it's not the weed talking!

803
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:36,260
- What's wrong?
- I need you to come with me.

804
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,025
Can you please tell me
where the hell we're going.

805
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:53,819
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

806
01:23:56,448 --> 01:24:00,534
- What's wrong? You scared of me?
- Yeah, I'm shitting my pants.

807
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:03,996
Yeah, you're scared.

808
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:15,424
Aya means "ancestors" in Quechua...

809
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,802
...and huasca means "plant."

810
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,390
The plant of the dead.

811
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,872
The ayahuasca is beautiful.

812
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,416
You must not fear it.

813
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,253
Take it.

814
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:56,548
Without fear.

815
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:03,764
Here it's prepared all natural,
without alterations.

816
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:09,937
It consists of two plants,
the ayahuasca and the chagropanga.

817
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,857
The ayahuasca tells one the truth.

818
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,527
It cleanses oneself.

819
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:20,864
It brings out all
the beautiful and all the ugly.

820
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:56,900
Help me!

821
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:03,986
What are you looking at?

822
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,120
What the fuck are you looking at?!

823
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:22,587
I know what happened.

824
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:26,341
I know because I saw it.

825
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,892
I saw it!

826
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:37,978
You disgust me!

827
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:40,564
Disgusting!

828
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:57,998
Are you all right?

829
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:03,003
Is this normal?

830
01:29:03,087 --> 01:29:06,506
Your friend is full of demons.

831
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:11,845
He took some coke earlier.

832
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:14,598
We must take him to my home in town.

833
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:15,682
Okay.

834
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:19,519
I don't have anything here,
but we must hurry!

835
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,104
Let's take him.

836
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:10,904
Are you feeling better?

837
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,038
Hello?

838
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:05,667
Finally! I've been calling all night!

839
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:08,170
Why didn't you answer my calls?

840
01:31:08,254 --> 01:31:11,214
Thing is, we were outside of Mancora.

841
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:15,594
Inigo is fine, we both are.
Where are you calling from?

842
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:22,309
I'm in town. I just bought
a ticket and I'm offto Lima.

843
01:31:23,686 --> 01:31:26,313
Wait, don't go.
What time do you leave?

844
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:27,647
This afternoon.

845
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:35,113
Xime wait, there's something
I need to tell you. I screwed up.

846
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:38,617
All right. Let's meet at the dock?

847
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:40,827
Perfect. Dock it is.

848
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:03,600
Well, aren't you a fucking idiot!

849
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:05,227
What the fuck are you doing here?

850
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:08,355
- No, nothing.
- You looking for something, huh?

851
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:09,731
Take it easy, man.

852
01:32:09,815 --> 01:32:13,193
- You've been having fun, huh?
- Chill, dude.

853
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,862
Grab him!

854
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:19,824
Look at me, punk!

855
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:23,870
- Hold him tight.
- Fuck him up!

856
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:37,551
Shit, my hand. Fucking pussy!

857
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:52,857
Make sure no one's looking!

858
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:05,620
Lesson learned.

859
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:20,051
If before each action...

860
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:23,763
...we could foresee
all of its reactions...

861
01:33:25,349 --> 01:33:28,518
I'm sure we would think it over.

862
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:34,774
I believed that because of my parents,
the world was indebted to me.

863
01:33:37,903 --> 01:33:40,572
Perhaps others weren't
necessarily the problem.

864
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:45,285
On the contrary , perhaps the problem
has always been me.

865
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,960
What has been of my dreams?

866
01:33:56,922 --> 01:33:59,174
I've had to reach rock bottom

867
01:33:59,258 --> 01:34:01,593
to realize the one indebted
is in fact me.

868
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:08,933
I now realize I have
my entire life ahead of me,

869
01:34:09,018 --> 01:34:13,188
and I cannot lose it or abandon it
like my father did...

870
01:34:13,272 --> 01:34:14,814
Not me!

871
01:34:28,579 --> 01:34:31,748
There are blows in life so hard...

872
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:34,959
I don't know.

873
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:46,346
Madrid, one month later

874
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:47,430
Perfect.

875
01:34:50,267 --> 01:34:51,601
Thanks so much.

876
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:55,855
The expo is gonna be great.
They're gonna love it!

877
01:34:55,940 --> 01:35:00,527
- As long as someone actually comes.
- It's gonna be great!

878
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:04,781
Hey, Diego, can you
take that downstairs.

879
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:14,958
Hey, Xime, from these stills,
which one's your favorite?

880
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:23,383
All of 'em.

881
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:30,390
I like them all the same.

882
01:36:04,383 --> 01:36:05,550
Xime.

883
01:36:06,385 --> 01:36:07,886
Santi.
