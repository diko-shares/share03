<i>We are often told...</i>

3
00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:41.772
<i>that happily ever afters exist
only in the pages of fairy tales...</i>

4
00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:45.542
<i>and in the naive minds
of sheltered innocents.</i>

5
00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:49.546
<i>And yet, on this bright,
sunny Boston afternoon,</i>

6
00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:53.683
<i>a talking teddy bear is about
to marry his girlfriend,</i>

7
00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:55.818

8
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.954
<i>Happy endings can come true
for anyone,</i>

9
00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:02.257
<i>and America doesn't
give a shit about anything.</i>

10
00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:04.993
Do you, Tami-Lynn McCafferty,

11
00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:09.030
take this teddy bear to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

12
00:01:09.032 --> 00:01:10.965
I do.

13
00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:16.035
And do you, Ted, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

14
00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:18.737
Fuckin'-A right, I do!

15
00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:22.373
Then, by the power vested in me,

16
00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:25.976
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bear.

17
00:02:13.788 --> 00:02:16.356
Thank you, folks!

18
00:02:16.358 --> 00:02:20.759
We're gonna take a short break
and pass things over to DJ Nightshade.

19
00:02:25.065 --> 00:02:27.665
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your newlyweds!</i>

20
00:02:35.373 --> 00:02:38.441
Teddy, this is
the best day of my life.

21

I love you too, baby.

- How you doing?
- Good, good.

He's a gourmet chef,
so he knows how to toss a salad.

33
00:03:15.503 --> 00:03:17.804
Rick and I are actually
about to tie the knot.

Oh, yeah. She wants more
than just a fucking pizza delivery, huh?

Being back in

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:34.932
I mean, everything seemed like
it was gonna be so perfect.

65
00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:38.101
Yeah. You're not the first guy
to marry the wrong girl.

you down tonight. Okay? This is a party.

Hey, hey!
Big day, huh, bud?

You guys wanna celebrate
with a little something else, hmm?

74
00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:03.221
Oh. No, thanks, Sam.

75
00:05:03.223 --> 00:05:05.523
Tami-Lynn would kill me if
I did drugs on our wedding day.

76
00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:07.558
Aw, she won't notice.

77
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.760
I just did a line with a dude
in the men's room,

78
00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:12.043
and I bet you can't
even spot him.

$129 at Filene's Basement.

Gold bars?

I need clothes for work.
All right, Teddy?

107
00:09:35.077 --> 00:09:37.744

No, no, no, no, no!
You're just buying weed.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.317
You're just buying drugs.
You should fucking talk!

112
00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:49.386

You wanna call me a whore?

133
00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:39.224

- Yeah, I wanna fucking throw shit!

134
00:10:39.226 --> 00:10:41.426

There, see?

135
00:10:41.428 --> 00:10:43.895

136
00:10:43.897 --> 00:10:46.264

For Christ's sake!

138
00:10:49.168 --> 00:10:51.034
Hey,<i> you</i> shut the fuck up!

139
00:10:51.036 --> 00:10:52.935
Come down and make me,
tough guy.

140
00:10:52.937 --> 00:10:55.270
Why don't you come up here
and make me come down there, tough guy?

141
00:10:55.272 --> 00:10:57.772
I am gonna come up there,
and I'm gonna kick your fucking ass!

142
00:10:57.774 --> 00:11:00.775
Try it, asshole.
Get your ass up here and kick my ass!

143
00:11:00.777 --> 00:11:05.812
Shut the fuck up, you stupid bitch!

144
00:11:09.984 --> 00:11:12.150
Shut the fuck up!

145
00:11:12.152 --> 00:11:14.085
- Hey, I'm really sorry!
- Yeah, me, too.

146
00:11:14.087 --> 00:11:16.954
- She's worse than us.
- She's our enemy now.

147
00:11:23.927 --> 00:11:26.895
Have you guys at least
tried marriage therapy?

148
00:11:26.897 --> 00:11:28.930
Oh, God, yeah.
It was a frigging disaster.

149
00:11:28.932 --> 00:11:31.265
$250 and we didn't
learn a goddamn thing.

150
00:11:31.467 --> 00:11:33.533
250? Dude,
that's ridiculous!

151
00:11:33.535 --> 00:11:35.234
Doesn't your insurance
cover that or something?

152
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:38.270
Nah, Tami-Lynn tried
to sign up for Obamacare on the Internet,

153
00:11:38.272 --> 00:11:41.072
but I came back five minutes later,
she was looking at black cocks.

154
00:11:41.074 --> 00:11:44.175
It seems like every time you go online,
you're two clicks away from black cocks.

155
00:11:44.177 --> 00:11:48.445
Look. See?
I'll Google "Grand Canyon."

156
00:11:48.447 --> 00:11:51.481
Here. Look, it says,
"Did you mean black cocks?"

157
00:11:51.483 --> 00:11:54.550
I don't know, man. I got to do
something or my marriage is gonna collapse.

158
00:11:54.552 --> 00:11:57.653
Here you go, guys.
We're gonna be closing in a few,

159
00:11:57.655 --> 00:12:01.490
but I'm going to this after-hours thing at
my friend's apartment, if you wanna join.

160
00:12:01.492 --> 00:12:04.459
Oh, thanks, Allison.
But I got an early day tomorrow.

161
00:12:04.461 --> 00:12:05.760
Oh. Okay.

162
00:12:05.762 --> 00:12:09.530
Well, if you change your mind,
here's the address.

163
00:12:12.367 --> 00:12:14.648
I put my cell number
on there too.

164
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.038
Oh, my God.
Are you fucking kidding me?

165
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.507
- What?
- What do you mean, "what?" After hours?

166
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:23.141
Jesus, Johnny.
She totally wants to sleep with you.

167
00:12:23.143 --> 00:12:25.143
I'm not into it.

168
00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:27.111
John, you've been saying that
for a year and a half...

169
00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:28.679
about every chick
that throws herself at you.

170
00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:32.149
Get back in the game, man!
Don't start this shit.

171
00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:35.051
Look, I wasted six years of my life
with the wrong girl, and I got burned.

172
00:12:35.053 --> 00:12:36.685
I'm not gonna make
that same mistake again.

173
00:12:36.687 --> 00:12:39.054
Jesus, Johnny.
You don't got to marry Allison.

174
00:12:39.056 --> 00:12:41.756
You just got to bang her and
maybe pee on her a little. What?

175
00:12:41.758 --> 00:12:45.226
It's always good to find
new ways to surprise your lover.

176
00:12:45.228 --> 00:12:46.908
Yeah,
I got to take a leak.

177
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.831
Sorry, Allison. I tried.

178
00:12:50.833 --> 00:12:52.566
It's okay.

179
00:12:52.568 --> 00:12:54.634
I just wish he wasn't
so goddamn cute.

180
00:12:54.636 --> 00:12:58.104
Yeah. Hey, can I get a Jack Daniel's
with just a splash of Grey Goose?

181
00:12:58.106 --> 00:13:00.272
Wish I could help you,
but we're closing.

182
00:13:00.274 --> 00:13:02.307
Oh, come on.
I been coming here since the '90s.

183
00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:04.375
Sorry, buddy.
No can do.

184
00:13:04.377 --> 00:13:06.510
Come on. One drink, and I promise
I won't tell anybody...

185
00:13:06.512 --> 00:13:09.112
that Jay Leno comes in here
for gay bathroom sex.

186
00:13:09.114 --> 00:13:10.580
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

187
00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:13.849
- Get off of me!
- Sorry. My mistake.

188
00:13:20.188 --> 00:13:22.088
There we go.

189
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.190
Thanks a lot.
Come again.

190
00:13:29.862 --> 00:13:32.730
- Hey.
- Hello.

191
00:13:32.732 --> 00:13:37.101
I'd like to ask a few questions
about this breakfast cereal.

192
00:13:37.103 --> 00:13:39.336
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Box of Trix.

193
00:13:39.338 --> 00:13:41.204
That's right.

194
00:13:41.206 --> 00:13:45.341
I've been led to understand
that Trix are exclusively for children.

195
00:13:45.343 --> 00:13:47.242
Is that correct?

196
00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:50.311
I mean, they say,
"Trix are for kids" in the commercials.

197
00:13:50.313 --> 00:13:52.346
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

198
00:13:52.348 --> 00:13:54.514
And is that enforced by law?

199
00:13:54.516 --> 00:13:57.216
Not to my knowledge, no.

200
00:13:57.218 --> 00:14:01.687
So if I purchase these Trix,
there'll be no trouble?

201
00:14:01.689 --> 00:14:04.189
No.
No, you should be fine.

202
00:14:04.191 --> 00:14:07.425
You do understand
that I myself am not a child?

203
00:14:07.427 --> 00:14:09.727
I-I was able to sniff that out,
yeah.

204
00:14:12.197 --> 00:14:14.198
Okay, I'm going to bring these
back to my apartment.

205
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.700
Yeah, yeah.
You'll be okay.

206
00:14:16.702 --> 00:14:19.836
And, uh,
I won't be followed?

207
00:14:19.838 --> 00:14:22.904
Uh, no, that's not
in our budget here.

208
00:14:26.308 --> 00:14:28.142
Hey.

209
00:14:28.144 --> 00:14:30.511
I won't forget what
you've done for me here today.

210
00:14:30.513 --> 00:14:32.346
I would prefer that you do.

211
00:14:38.319 --> 00:14:40.820
Jesus Christ.

212
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:52.329
You two still not talking?

213
00:14:52.331 --> 00:14:55.732
No. Honest to God, Joy,
I don't know how to fix this.

214
00:14:55.734 --> 00:14:58.601
How the hell do you take a broken
marriage and make it work again?

215
00:14:58.603 --> 00:15:01.904
Well, I'll tell you one way.
You have yourselves a baby.

216
00:15:01.906 --> 00:15:04.907
- A baby?
- Uh-huh. Look at that.

217
00:15:04.909 --> 00:15:06.642
You see them two white niggas
over there?

218
00:15:06.644 --> 00:15:08.844
Yeah. What?

219
00:15:08.846 --> 00:15:10.679
Look at 'em.
They're so happy.

220
00:15:10.681 --> 00:15:13.415
Because they got
that little baby keeping them together.

221
00:15:13.417 --> 00:15:15.583
If they didn't have that baby,

222
00:15:15.585 --> 00:15:19.320
they'd just be two sad-ass white niggas
waiting for <i>"Downtown" Abbey</i> to come on.

223
00:15:19.322 --> 00:15:21.922
Wow, you said it twice.
Is that an actual phrase?

224
00:15:21.924 --> 00:15:25.191
I'm telling you, Ted. Y'all better
have a baby or your marriage is over.

225
00:15:25.193 --> 00:15:26.625
Trust.

226
00:15:35.733 --> 00:15:39.936
- Uh, hey.
- Go away, Teddy.

227
00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:42.338
Tami, listen.
I just wanna talk to you.

228
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.939
Will you just
listen to me for one second?

229
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:45.974
Why? So you can give me shit
about my clothes?

230
00:15:45.976 --> 00:15:49.210
No! Look, I'm sorry about that, okay?
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:49.212 --> 00:15:52.346
- I was an asshole, and I didn't mean it.
- You know, whatever, Teddy.

232
00:15:52.348 --> 00:15:55.515
Tami, listen.
I love you.

233
00:15:55.517 --> 00:15:59.318
Okay? And I don't want us to fight like
we've been doing the past few months.

234
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.287
I don't know, Teddy.
Something's got to change, you know?

235
00:16:02.289 --> 00:16:05.723
Because I can't do this no more.
It's too much.

236
00:16:05.725 --> 00:16:07.424
I know, I know, I know.

237
00:16:07.426 --> 00:16:11.560
And that's why...
I wanna have a baby.

238
00:16:13.329 --> 00:16:14.429
You do?

239
00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:15.630
Yeah.

240
00:16:15.632 --> 00:16:18.366
A baby?
Like, really?

241
00:16:18.368 --> 00:16:21.802
Yeah. See, I think,
if we got a kid to love...

242
00:16:21.804 --> 00:16:23.770
it'll teach us how to love
each other again.

243
00:16:23.772 --> 00:16:25.905
Oh, my God, Teddy.

244
00:16:25.907 --> 00:16:27.940
You better not be
messing with me.

245
00:16:27.942 --> 00:16:29.574
I swear to God,
not messing with you.

246
00:16:29.576 --> 00:16:31.275
I think you'd make
an awesome mom.

247
00:16:31.277 --> 00:16:32.809
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding me?

248
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:34.877
I would, like,
kick so much ass at mommin'.

249
00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:36.411
What do you say?
We all good?

250
00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:39.280
Yes! Oh, I love you!
I love you so much!

251
00:16:39.282 --> 00:16:41.849
Baby, I love you too!

252
00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:43.771
Let's make a baby!
Let's make a baby!

253
00:17:03.467 --> 00:17:06.869
Lemme know when you're ready to go,
and I'll stick a bottle of Newman's Own in ya.

254
00:17:06.871 --> 00:17:09.705
All the profits go to charity.

255
00:17:09.707 --> 00:17:13.308
You had sexual intercourse
on a pile of raw hamburger meat...

256
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.410
that we're supposed to
sell to the public...

257
00:17:15.412 --> 00:17:17.712
for their
Fourth of July barbecues.

258
00:17:17.714 --> 00:17:19.814
I fucked her
with a pack of Freedent.

259
00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:23.417
Then I put it back on the shelf
and a senior citizen bought it.

260
00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:25.452
That took guts.

261
00:17:25.454 --> 00:17:27.854
We need guts.

262
00:17:27.856 --> 00:17:30.456
I'm naming the store after you.

263
00:17:37.564 --> 00:17:39.997
Okay, you ready?
Oh, shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:42.332

So in the pocket.

277
00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:22.666
Hey, so listen, I got some big
news to tell you. Yeah? What's that?

278
00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:25.902
Tami-Lynn and I
are gonna have a baby.

279
00:18:27.905 --> 00:18:29.705
Holy shit!
You?

280
00:18:29.707 --> 00:18:31.573
Yeah, yeah.
We talked about it today.

281
00:18:31.575 --> 00:18:33.575
Dude, that's fucking awesome!
Congratulations!

282
00:18:33.577 --> 00:18:36.444
Thank you! Wait, wait, wait.
How do you guys...

283
00:18:36.446 --> 00:18:40.448
Well, uh, that's the thing.
We got to find a sperm donor.

284
00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:45.119
And, I'm wondering, what do you think
Sam Jones would say if I asked him?

285
00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:47.688
You want Flash Gordon
to father your child?

286
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.389
Yeah. You think...
Would that be weird?

287
00:18:49.391 --> 00:18:52.392
Would he be freaked out if I...
No, I think he'd be flattered!

288
00:18:52.394 --> 00:18:54.794
And plus, your baby
will be a fucking superhero!

289
00:18:54.796 --> 00:18:56.862
That was the logic
I arrived at as well.

290
00:18:56.864 --> 00:18:59.064
Yeah, I say do it!
All right. Great.

291
00:18:59.066 --> 00:19:01.366
I'll shoot him an e-mail
and see if I can stop by.

292
00:19:01.368 --> 00:19:02.767
You come with me?
Sure.

293
00:19:02.769 --> 00:19:04.702
All right, great.

294
00:19:06.705 --> 00:19:09.039
Shit. I can never get a signal
in your apartment.

295
00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:11.141
Hey, can I use your laptop?
Yeah, go ahead.

296
00:19:11.143 --> 00:19:13.376
Okay, thanks.

297
00:19:17.147 --> 00:19:19.648
What the fuck?
Holy shit! Dude, what's the matter?

298
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.650
What happened?
What's going on?

299
00:19:21.652 --> 00:19:23.852
There's so much porn!

300
00:19:23.854 --> 00:19:25.887
What the hell are you doing
looking at my private shit?

301
00:19:25.889 --> 00:19:30.591
Johnny, it was wide open!
There are literally thousands of files here!

302
00:19:30.593 --> 00:19:32.559
I've been meaning to
clear some of that out.

303
00:19:32.561 --> 00:19:34.761
Jesus Chri...
Look at the organization here!

304
00:19:34.763 --> 00:19:37.697
"Clockwise rim job."
"Counterclockwise rim job."

305
00:19:37.699 --> 00:19:39.899
Yeah, sometimes you like seeing
the tongue go the other way!

306
00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:43.035
You sick bastard!
Look at this! Chicks with dicks?

307
00:19:43.037 --> 00:19:46.972
Oh, my God!
I have a disease, all right?
I need help!

308
00:19:46.974 --> 00:19:49.541
There are no chicks with dicks, Johnny!
Only guys with tits!

309
00:19:49.543 --> 00:19:51.609
This is such a relief!
I'm glad I'm finally caught.

310
00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:53.410
I wanted to be caught!

311
00:19:53.412 --> 00:19:55.812
Johnny, now you listen to me.
This is a wake-up call.

312
00:19:55.814 --> 00:19:57.947
You got to get back out there
and meet somebody...

313
00:19:57.949 --> 00:20:00.015
because you are spiraling
out of control here.

314
00:20:00.017 --> 00:20:02.784
All right, fine, I will.
Just stop looking at that shit, please!

315
00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:05.887
Johnny, I mean it.
The next chick you meet, you
are getting back in the game.

316
00:20:05.889 --> 00:20:08.422
- Fine, I got it. Done.
- All right.

317
00:20:08.424 --> 00:20:10.891
- Let's get rid of this.
- What do you mean?
We'll just delete the files!

318
00:20:10.893 --> 00:20:12.826
No, no, no. That shit
can always be recovered.

319
00:20:12.828 --> 00:20:15.868
We got to smash your laptop
with a hammer.

320
00:20:21.133 --> 00:20:22.833
- There. You happy?
- No.

321
00:20:22.835 --> 00:20:24.801
The circuits could
still be reconstructed.

322
00:20:24.803 --> 00:20:27.003
We got to bury it
in the harbor.

323
00:20:43.553 --> 00:20:46.888
Okay, we'll come back once every
three months, take a dive and check on it.

324
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.624
So, uh, basically, that's it.

325
00:20:50.626 --> 00:20:53.159
We need a sperm donor.
So what do you say?

326
00:20:53.161 --> 00:20:55.060
You'd really be helping
me and Tami out.

327
00:20:55.062 --> 00:20:56.661
No can do, my brother.

328
00:20:56.663 --> 00:20:58.796
Well, why not?

329
00:20:58.798 --> 00:21:00.931
Look, I did a lot of blow
in the '80s,

330
00:21:00.933 --> 00:21:04.567
and my sperm count's
a little low.

331
00:21:04.569 --> 00:21:05.734
How low?

332
00:21:06.802 --> 00:21:08.803
- One.
- One?

333
00:21:08.805 --> 00:21:12.773
Yeah, little fella's having his own
<i>I Am Legend</i> in my nut sack.

334
00:21:12.775 --> 00:21:14.608
Well,
can we have that one?

335
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.078
No! Gonna need it for protein
if I ever get lost at sea.

336
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.580
Come on, guys.
I mean, are we done here?
I got to go.

337
00:21:20.582 --> 00:21:23.716
That<i> Sister, Sister</i> marathon
ain't gonna watch itself.

338
00:21:23.718 --> 00:21:26.852
Can't believe it.
That son of a bitch.

339
00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:28.820
That was really selfish of him.
I know.

340
00:21:28.822 --> 00:21:31.522
And after I watched his piece-of-shit movie,
like, a hundred times.

341
00:21:31.524 --> 00:21:33.023
Goddamn it!

342
00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:36.760
Oh, shit!

343
00:21:40.898 --> 00:21:43.699
Johnny, please, just help me do this.
Okay?

344
00:21:43.701 --> 00:21:46.535
He's the only guy in the world whose
sperm is even close to Flash Gordon's.

345
00:21:46.537 --> 00:21:48.570
Ted, it's insane.
We could get in a lot of trouble.

346
00:21:48.572 --> 00:21:50.104
But not
if nobody finds out.

347
00:21:50.106 --> 00:21:52.206
Look, look, John, John.
We sneak into his house,

348
00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:54.641
jerk him off in his sleep
and sneak out with the sperm.

349
00:21:54.643 --> 00:21:57.710
It'll be easy.
And think how awesome the baby will be.

350
00:21:57.712 --> 00:21:59.878
Would be a sweet-ass
fucking baby.

351
00:22:01.213 --> 00:22:03.781
I'll help you.
But we got to have a game plan.

352
00:22:14.091 --> 00:22:17.726
Just calm down.

353
00:22:19.662 --> 00:22:20.662
Yeah, can I help you?

354
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.965
Hey!
Are you "Tom Brady"?

355
00:22:24.967 --> 00:22:26.099
Yeah.

356
00:22:26.101 --> 00:22:29.068
Hey.
Your neighbors called,

357
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.702
and your air conditioner's
making a loud noise...

358
00:22:30.704 --> 00:22:32.570
so I'm supposed to
check out the unit.

359
00:22:32.572 --> 00:22:34.672
- Okay. Yeah, it's around back.
- Okay.

360
00:22:34.674 --> 00:22:37.941
I just may need a signature in case
I got to get some parts, for the billing.

361
00:22:37.943 --> 00:22:42.812
You could just write that to John and Ted.
Put number 12.

362
00:22:42.814 --> 00:22:45.648
And you're not a cheater.
I think your balls are perfect.

363
00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.549
- It's around back.
- All right. Yeah.

364
00:22:56.058 --> 00:22:57.758
Okay.

365
00:23:09.203 --> 00:23:12.572
Stupid idiot.

366
00:23:19.245 --> 00:23:21.165
Okay. Go, go, go!

367
00:23:36.995 --> 00:23:39.028
Take the damn raincoat off.
It's making too much noise.

368
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.150
Piss off! I don't wanna
get any jizz on me.

369
00:23:51.875 --> 00:23:55.210
Two league MVPs,
four Super Bowl rings,

370
00:23:55.212 --> 00:23:58.146
guaranteed first ballot
hall-of-famer.

371
00:23:58.148 --> 00:24:01.015
Now let's give him a hand job
into this red Solo cup.

372
00:24:01.017 --> 00:24:02.683
All right.
Go ahead.

373
00:24:02.685 --> 00:24:04.751
What do you mean, go ahead?
You do it.

374
00:24:04.753 --> 00:24:07.754
What are you talking about?
You're the one who needs the sperm.

375
00:24:07.756 --> 00:24:10.790
But it's got to be a human hand.
It's got to be skin on skin,
otherwise it doesn't work.

376
00:24:10.792 --> 00:24:12.291
No, it doesn't.
It's just friction.

377
00:24:12.293 --> 00:24:14.259
I've never done this before.
Neither have I.

378
00:24:14.261 --> 00:24:16.194
You do it to yourself.
Yeah, but that's different.

379
00:24:16.196 --> 00:24:18.963
You're an adult with a poster of this guy
in your fucking room.

380
00:24:18.965 --> 00:24:20.898
You're tellin' me
you don't want this?

381
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.333
Yeah, I want it.
You know I want it, but I'm nervous.

382
00:24:23.335 --> 00:24:25.401
What if he doesn't
like the way I do it?

383
00:24:25.403 --> 00:24:28.971
Pull yourself together, for God's sakes.
He's gonna love it. Go, go, go.

384
00:24:28.973 --> 00:24:30.839
All right.

385
00:24:32.808 --> 00:24:37.144
Sweet God and baby Jesus.

386
00:24:37.146 --> 00:24:38.845
And that's at rest.

387
00:24:39.313 --> 00:24:41.080
What the hell?

388
00:24:41.082 --> 00:24:42.781
Mr. Brady, we need a moment of
your time.

389
00:24:42.783 --> 00:24:45.983
What are you doing here?
Who are you? Get out of my house!

390
00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:50.987
- Oh, God!
- Wait, Mr. Brady!

391
00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:54.357
Take your goddamn teddy bear with you!

392
00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:56.926
Holy shit!
Perfect spiral!

393
00:24:56.928 --> 00:24:58.861
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

394
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.704
Shit!
What the hell do we do now?

395
00:25:11.873 --> 00:25:13.273
Hey, Ted, let me
ask you something.

396
00:25:13.275 --> 00:25:14.841
What's that?

397
00:25:14.843 --> 00:25:16.709
Why didn't you
just come to me?

398
00:25:16.711 --> 00:25:19.812
What are you talking about?
For the sperm.

399
00:25:19.814 --> 00:25:22.915
Johnny, you kidding me, man?

400
00:25:22.917 --> 00:25:25.083
You were the first person
I wanted to go to.

401
00:25:25.085 --> 00:25:28.186
But you've just been so bummed out
over your divorce lately...

402
00:25:28.188 --> 00:25:32.256
that I didn't want to put you
in an awkward position.

403
00:25:32.258 --> 00:25:35.158
And plus, after seeing your laptop,
I didn't think you had any left.

404
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.793
Just so you know,
I'm totally willing to do it.

405
00:25:38.394 --> 00:25:39.761
Really?

406
00:25:39.763 --> 00:25:41.929
You'd do that for me?

407
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:44.364
What? Ted, you're my best friend.
I'd do anything for you.

408
00:25:44.366 --> 00:25:48.801
Besides, we just broke into Tom Brady's
house and tried to jerk him off.

409
00:25:48.803 --> 00:25:50.269
You're ready to be a parent.

410
00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:53.805
God,
I don't know what to say.

411
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.808
Johnny, thank you.
Thank you so much!

412
00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:00.710
Hey, thunder buddies
for life, remember?

413
00:26:00.712 --> 00:26:02.978
Thunder buddies for life.

414
00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.914
Come on. We got to get out of here
before the cops show up.

415
00:26:05.916 --> 00:26:08.716
<i>All units,
we have a 317 on Maple Drive.</i>

416
00:26:08.718 --> 00:26:10.384
<i>Area units, please respond.</i>

417
00:26:10.386 --> 00:26:14.821
What's a 317? Someone's trying to steal
Tom Brady's jizz again.

418
00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:16.389
Really?

419
00:26:16.391 --> 00:26:18.891
Welcome to Boston, kid.

420
00:26:31.203 --> 00:26:33.270
What is that?
What?

421
00:26:33.272 --> 00:26:35.105
What are you doing?
I'm getting ready, dude.

422
00:26:35.107 --> 00:26:37.340
What do you mean?
What are you doing to your hand?

423
00:26:37.342 --> 00:26:39.942
I'm doing this for you.
I'm getting ready.
I got to go in and perform.

424
00:26:39.944 --> 00:26:41.843
You got your hand on your dick.

425
00:26:41.845 --> 00:26:44.245
I'm trying to get it half hard,
so I could just bust it out.

426
00:26:44.247 --> 00:26:46.413
Sitting out here in public,
jerking off?

427
00:26:46.415 --> 00:26:48.214
Where do you think you are?
Red Lobster?

428
00:26:48.216 --> 00:26:50.349
What do you think I got to do in there?
Forget it.

429
00:26:50.351 --> 00:26:53.085
But, now, look, you haven't smoked pot
for two whole days, right?

430
00:26:53.087 --> 00:26:55.921
Yes, I told you.
I'm clean, all right?
Your baby's gonna be fine.

431
00:26:55.923 --> 00:27:00.025
I'm sorry. I just don't want something
I got to feed with a pitchfork when he's 16.

432
00:27:00.027 --> 00:27:02.527
- "John Bennett."
- Hi.

433
00:27:02.529 --> 00:27:05.369
Right this way. I'll show you where
to deposit your specimen.

434
00:27:05.897 --> 00:27:07.430
Hey, Johnny.
Johnny.

435
00:27:17.506 --> 00:27:19.440
I'm John Bennett.

436
00:27:19.442 --> 00:27:21.508
I know.
I just said your name.

437
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.310
Oh, right. Yeah.
Sorry. I'm just a little nervous.

438
00:27:24.312 --> 00:27:26.545
I've been out of the game
for a while.

439
00:27:26.547 --> 00:27:30.215
The game?
I don't talk to pretty girls that often.

440
00:27:30.217 --> 00:27:32.150
Pretty women, ladies.

441
00:27:32.152 --> 00:27:34.085
I see.

442
00:27:34.087 --> 00:27:36.407
Hey, when I'm done here,
how about a drink?

443
00:27:36.888 --> 00:27:39.456
I didn't... I don't...
I don't mean this.

444
00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:42.992
- I meant, like, a regular drink.
- I have a boyfriend.

445
00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:44.793
Oh.
Yeah, okay, yeah.

446
00:27:44.795 --> 00:27:46.995
Too bad.
You're missing out on a great guy.

447
00:27:46.997 --> 00:27:51.065
Um, do I just spit in my hand or do
I get a lube or something?

448
00:27:51.067 --> 00:27:53.967
A magazine? Video?
I like Asian teen stuff preferably.

449
00:27:53.969 --> 00:27:57.169
There's lube right there.
All right. Yeah, thanks.

450
00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:04.842
Excuse me. Where's your
non-jerk-off bathroom?

451
00:28:04.844 --> 00:28:06.276
Down that hallway,
to the left.

452
00:28:06.278 --> 00:28:08.144
Okay, thanks.

453
00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.650
Oh, no way.

454
00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:20.188
Hey, Doc, is this where you guys
store all the stuff?

455
00:28:21.523 --> 00:28:24.291
It's the intermediary station
before insemination.

456
00:28:24.293 --> 00:28:26.226
Are you submitting?
No.

457
00:28:26.228 --> 00:28:29.229
My friend is yanking out a sample
in one of the rooms.

458
00:28:29.231 --> 00:28:30.830
Well, that's a good friend.
Yeah.

459
00:28:30.832 --> 00:28:33.098
- I'm Dr. Danzer.
- Oh, cool.

460
00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.568
♪ Hold me closer
Dr. Danzer ♪

461
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:37.902
Yeah, whatever.
I don't know.

462
00:28:37.904 --> 00:28:39.536
Now, wait.
You look familiar.

463
00:28:39.538 --> 00:28:43.373
- Are you that teddy bear who came alive?
- I am. That's me, yeah.

464
00:28:43.375 --> 00:28:45.608
I was trying to figure out
where I'd seen you before, and that's it.

465
00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.443
Good eye, good eye.

466
00:28:47.445 --> 00:28:50.412
So, how did you get into this line of work?
Do you just love come?

467
00:28:50.414 --> 00:28:53.148
Not especially.

468
00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.284
But I love helping good people
fulfill their dreams of having children.

469
00:28:56.286 --> 00:28:58.586
It's amazing
what we can do here.

470
00:28:58.588 --> 00:29:00.321
You wanna have a look?

471
00:29:00.323 --> 00:29:01.955
Yeah, sure.

472
00:29:04.058 --> 00:29:07.493
This is where we perform
our pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.

473
00:29:07.495 --> 00:29:10.028
We can eliminate
hereditary diseases...

474
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:12.997
such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy,
sickle-cell anemia.

475
00:29:12.999 --> 00:29:15.399
- The list goes on and on, really.
- Wow.

476
00:29:15.401 --> 00:29:19.002
- Hey, Johnny! You did it!
- Right here, buddy.

477
00:29:19.004 --> 00:29:21.004
Ew.
I mean, awesome!

478
00:29:21.006 --> 00:29:24.540
Excuse me. Doctor, your wife's on the phone.
She said it's an emergency.

479
00:29:24.542 --> 00:29:26.508
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

480
00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.644
You wanna see it? Huh?
You wanna see your kid?

481
00:29:30.646 --> 00:29:32.312
I can see it from here.
Thanks.

482
00:29:32.314 --> 00:29:34.981
- Take a closer look. It's your kid.
- No, no, no! Come on!

483
00:29:34.983 --> 00:29:36.916
- Take a closer look.
- That's close enough!

484
00:29:36.918 --> 00:29:38.450
- He's beautiful.
- I'll trade you. Catch.

485
00:29:38.452 --> 00:29:40.318
- Shit!
- Oh, God!

486
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.386
Fuck, dude.
That's somebody's kid!

487
00:29:42.388 --> 00:29:45.055
Well, it's not my fault, A-Rod!
You were supposed to catch it!

488
00:29:45.057 --> 00:29:46.990
- We got to find something to scoop it up.
- There's containers over there.

489
00:29:46.992 --> 00:29:49.158
Shit.
All right.

490
00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.059
No, no, that's not gonna work.
You need two of them.

491
00:29:51.061 --> 00:29:52.393
Scoop one into the other.

492
00:29:52.395 --> 00:29:54.461
Oh, shit!
Fuck!

493
00:29:54.463 --> 00:29:56.496
Oh! Oh, fuck!

494
00:29:56.498 --> 00:29:59.131
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

495
00:29:59.133 --> 00:30:01.299
Oh, my God!
It's in my eyes!

496
00:30:01.301 --> 00:30:03.601
- I'm blinking it in!
You got to fucking help me!

497
00:30:03.603 --> 00:30:05.235
God! It's in my fucking mouth!

498
00:30:05.237 --> 00:30:06.936
Hang on. I got to
post this on Facebook.

499
00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:08.170
No!

500
00:30:08.172 --> 00:30:11.139
Hashtag "Grr, Mondays."

501
00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:14.108
- Oh, my God!
- Look, I'm so sorry.

502
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.443
We swear to God.
It was an accident.
We're so sorry.

503
00:30:16.445 --> 00:30:20.146
Well, I guess it's all right.
Those are the rejected sickle-cell samples.

504
00:30:20.148 --> 00:30:22.014
Ah, you hear that, Johnny?

505
00:30:22.016 --> 00:30:25.117
You're covered in rejected black-guy sperm.
You look like a Kardashian.

506
00:30:25.119 --> 00:30:27.185
Fuck!

507
00:30:39.063 --> 00:30:42.965
No, make sure you have all the updated
information on our Comic Con placement.

508
00:30:42.967 --> 00:30:46.368
This has to be the biggest,
most impressive rollout at the convention.

509
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:49.437
Morning, Mr. Jessup.
Good morning. Now...

510
00:30:49.439 --> 00:30:51.172
My name's Donny.

511
00:30:51.174 --> 00:30:53.140
Hi, Donny.

512
00:30:53.142 --> 00:30:55.475
Hi. Now this is
a multi-platform release,

513
00:30:55.477 --> 00:30:57.917
- so I want a full report on all...
- Fresh cakes.

514
00:31:00.047 --> 00:31:02.448
What?
In the urinals, sir.

515
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.083
I noticed you always
use urinal four,

516
00:31:05.085 --> 00:31:07.251
so I put fresh cakes
in there for you.

517
00:31:07.253 --> 00:31:10.533
You're an important man.
You should never have to smell pee.

518
00:31:10.955 --> 00:31:13.475
See, most people flip the cakes.

519
00:31:14.257 --> 00:31:16.424
I replace the cakes.

520
00:31:16.426 --> 00:31:18.993
That's the Donny difference.

521
00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:24.131
I need a full report on all the
placement of our merchandise.

522
00:31:24.133 --> 00:31:26.099
Contact Bob Jennings
at Javits...

523
00:31:53.594 --> 00:31:55.361
Hi, Ted.

524
00:31:56.229 --> 00:31:58.196
I've missed you.

525
00:31:59.498 --> 00:32:01.765
<i>I love you!</i>

526
00:32:01.767 --> 00:32:03.633
I wuv you too.

527
00:32:04.768 --> 00:32:08.503
I wuv you too!
I wuv you too!

528
00:32:12.107 --> 00:32:15.309
Pretty soon you'll be
saying that for real.

529
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:18.312
Pretty soon.
Pretty soon. Pretty soon.

530
00:32:18.314 --> 00:32:21.114
This is gonna work.
This is gonna work.
This is gonna work.

531
00:32:21.116 --> 00:32:22.548
Okay.

532
00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.315
Just... Shh!

533
00:32:27.585 --> 00:32:29.686
Okay.

534
00:32:29.688 --> 00:32:32.054
Okay.

535
00:32:38.061 --> 00:32:41.462
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

536
00:32:41.464 --> 00:32:43.530
Oh, sh...

537
00:32:49.169 --> 00:32:50.636
Soon, my love.

538
00:32:51.704 --> 00:32:53.371
Soon.

539
00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:57.174
I'm afraid
I have bad news.

540
00:32:57.176 --> 00:33:00.177
I won't be able to perform
the implantation procedure.

541
00:33:00.179 --> 00:33:02.312
Wait, what?
Why not?

542
00:33:02.314 --> 00:33:06.249
Tami-Lynn, according to your test results,
you're no longer fertile.

543
00:33:06.251 --> 00:33:07.450
What?

544
00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:09.552
Wait, Doc, are you sure
about that?

545
00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:11.654
Maybe you should check
again or something, you know?

546
00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:13.322
I'm quite sure.

547
00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:16.391
Tami-Lynn, because of your history
of excessive drug use...

548
00:33:16.393 --> 00:33:20.528
your ovarian canal has been
somewhat compromised.

549
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.330
What are you talking about?
It looks fine. Yeah.

550
00:33:23.531 --> 00:33:25.665
Forgive me.
That's a normal ovary.

551
00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:27.566
This is Tami-Lynn's.

552
00:33:27.568 --> 00:33:29.067
Jesus.

553
00:33:29.069 --> 00:33:31.402
Yeah, but I bet this stuff
happens a lot.

554
00:33:31.404 --> 00:33:33.470
You probably see this kind of stuff
all the time, right?

555
00:33:33.472 --> 00:33:36.139
No, not once.
Not ever.

556
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:39.542
When I saw this, I threw up.
Almost quit medicine.

557
00:33:39.544 --> 00:33:42.745
Bottom line is,
insemination is not possible.

558
00:33:42.747 --> 00:33:46.181
I don't understand, okay?
None of this makes any sense.

559
00:33:46.183 --> 00:33:48.216
It's okay. It's okay, honey.
Come on. Let's go.

560
00:33:48.218 --> 00:33:50.818
But what does this mean, Teddy?
Does it mean we can't have a baby?

561
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.720
I don't know.
But it's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

562
00:33:53.722 --> 00:33:55.154
It really isn't.

563
00:34:07.166 --> 00:34:09.867
Teddy, I got
a really good feeling about this.

564
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:11.401
I know. Me too.

565
00:34:11.403 --> 00:34:13.202
I mean, adoption's great.
Right?

566
00:34:13.204 --> 00:34:15.837
Oh, yeah.
I mean, Steve Jobs was adopted.

567
00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:18.506
Yeah! Yeah.
And also a million kids who did nothin'.

568
00:34:19.841 --> 00:34:21.875
You know, Teddy,

569
00:34:21.877 --> 00:34:25.411
this has been nice,
you and me doing this together.

570
00:34:25.413 --> 00:34:27.813
It's like we have a common goal
or somethin'. Right?

571
00:34:27.815 --> 00:34:30.816
I love hearing you say that,
'cause I feel exactly the same way.

572
00:34:30.818 --> 00:34:33.752
- And we ain't fought in, like, a week.
- I know! We haven't!

573
00:34:33.754 --> 00:34:36.387
Hey, if the baby works out,
we should get a dog.

574
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:38.689
Oh, my God.
A German shepherd.

575
00:34:38.691 --> 00:34:41.658
- A German shepherd and a baby, together.
- It's, like, the perfect family.

576
00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.726
- And a gun to protect us all!
- Yes!

577
00:34:43.728 --> 00:34:46.128
Okay, as soon as we get the baby,
we get the gun.

578
00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:49.231
I love our gun-dog-baby family!

579
00:34:50.766 --> 00:34:52.833
Well, I've gone through
your application...

580
00:34:52.835 --> 00:34:55.502
and vetted
your personal histories,

581
00:34:55.504 --> 00:34:58.984
and I'm afraid
this isn't gonna work out.

582
00:34:59.373 --> 00:35:01.807
What?
Why not?

583
00:35:01.809 --> 00:35:05.277
First of all, there's the question
of Tami-Lynn's drug conviction.

584
00:35:05.279 --> 00:35:07.379
Hey, I did my community service.

585
00:35:07.381 --> 00:35:09.861
Yeah, besides, that was five years ago.
She's clean.

586
00:35:10.683 --> 00:35:12.917
There's another issue...

587
00:35:12.919 --> 00:35:14.919
and, honestly,
it's the more serious one.

588
00:35:14.921 --> 00:35:17.688
I was reluctant
to bring it up because...

589
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.757
it's a little awkward.

590
00:35:20.759 --> 00:35:24.860
Ted, in the eyes of the state,
you are not a person.

591
00:35:26.162 --> 00:35:28.696
Wait, what?

592
00:35:28.698 --> 00:35:34.434
The state official I spoke to said that technically,
you are classified as property.

593
00:35:36.403 --> 00:35:38.904
I'm not a person?

594
00:35:38.906 --> 00:35:42.173
Not according to the government.
I'm sorry.

595
00:35:42.175 --> 00:35:43.641
But that is so fucked up!

596
00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:45.809
Property?

597
00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:47.911
You know what, Teddy?
Let's get out of here.

598
00:35:47.913 --> 00:35:49.479
Come on.

599
00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:53.716
Look.
You seem like good people.

600
00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:55.317
Be careful.

601
00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:57.485
What do you mean,
be careful?

602
00:35:57.487 --> 00:35:59.820
The state official
I spoke to...

603
00:35:59.822 --> 00:36:03.890
made it sound like your status
had gone under the radar for some time.

604
00:36:03.892 --> 00:36:07.393
Your adoption request
may have raised some red flags.

605
00:36:07.395 --> 00:36:09.661
If they choose
to investigate the issue,

606
00:36:09.663 --> 00:36:12.563
it may leave you
quite vulnerable.

607
00:36:25.809 --> 00:36:28.377
Hey. I just got off work
and heard your message.

608
00:36:28.379 --> 00:36:29.911
Did they actually tell you that?

609
00:36:29.913 --> 00:36:33.681
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
Property... They said I'm property.

610
00:36:33.683 --> 00:36:35.749
What does that even mean?
Like, you're a thing?

611
00:36:35.751 --> 00:36:37.717
What, like garbage
or a piece of shit?

612
00:36:37.719 --> 00:36:41.654
Well, I mean, maybe more like a hammer
or an orange, but yeah.

613
00:36:41.656 --> 00:36:44.256
What the hell do they know?
It's just a word.

614
00:36:44.258 --> 00:36:46.458
They can't change your whole life just
by calling you property.

615
00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.594
Bullshit!
You better ask my ancestors.

616
00:36:49.596 --> 00:36:52.463
One minute, you in Africa,
washing your clothes in a river.

617
00:36:52.465 --> 00:36:54.498
Titties out. You good.

618
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.701
Then all of a sudden, you somewhere
across the world, fucking Thomas Jefferson.

619
00:36:57.703 --> 00:37:00.470
Wow! You make history
come alive.

620
00:37:00.472 --> 00:37:02.405
Why the hell is this
just coming up now?

621
00:37:02.407 --> 00:37:04.774
Well, I mean,
I've never voted.

622
00:37:04.776 --> 00:37:07.610
I don't have a driver's license.
I don't pay taxes.

623
00:37:07.612 --> 00:37:09.478
I mean, hell, this is
the first job I ever had.

624
00:37:10.947 --> 00:37:14.482
Ted, can I see you for a moment?

625
00:37:14.484 --> 00:37:17.785
I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna have to let you go.

626
00:37:17.787 --> 00:37:21.755
What? Why? I've been busting
my ass at this job for three years!

627
00:37:21.757 --> 00:37:23.923
I just got a call
from the Labor Department.

628
00:37:25.392 --> 00:37:27.359
I can't legally keep you on
as an employee...

629
00:37:27.361 --> 00:37:29.327
because I've been informed
that you're technically...

630
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:32.496
Technically not a person.
Yeah. Jesus Christ.

631
00:37:32.498 --> 00:37:36.866
I'm sorry.
But as of today, you're fired.

632
00:37:40.371 --> 00:37:44.639
"Dear Ted, your Chase Bank account has been
terminated due to a lack of citizenship."

633
00:37:44.641 --> 00:37:47.808
"Dear Ted, your Discover card
has been revoked."

634
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.443
"Dear Ted, you are no longer
a Papa Gino's rewards member."

635
00:37:50.445 --> 00:37:52.011
Fuck, that's a big one.

636
00:37:52.013 --> 00:37:56.715
This poor baby booty.
It's always gonna be empty.

637
00:37:56.717 --> 00:37:58.817
There's never gonna be
a little foot in here.

638
00:37:58.819 --> 00:38:01.586
I don't understand.
We would have made such great parents.

639
00:38:03.323 --> 00:38:06.390
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Teddy!

640
00:38:06.392 --> 00:38:09.292
What? What's wrong?
Look at this.

641
00:38:09.294 --> 00:38:13.496
"Dear Ted, the state of Massachusetts
regrets to inform you...

642
00:38:13.498 --> 00:38:16.432
that due to an oversight
regarding your legal status,

643
00:38:16.434 --> 00:38:21.503
your marriage to Tami-Lynn McCafferty
is unrecognized by the state...

644
00:38:21.505 --> 00:38:24.506
and, therefore, invalid
and hereby annulled."

645
00:38:24.508 --> 00:38:27.508
- Teddy, can they do this to us?
- Let me see that.

646
00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.980
This is a nightmare.

647
00:38:36.383 --> 00:38:38.684
- You fucking believe that?
- No.

648
00:38:38.686 --> 00:38:41.853
This is insane.
I mean, Tami's the woman I love.

649
00:38:41.855 --> 00:38:44.322
I never would even have
tried to adopt a dog...

650
00:38:44.324 --> 00:38:46.424
if I had known it was gonna
cause me this shit storm.

651
00:38:46.426 --> 00:38:50.528
This whole thing is complete bullshit.
We gotta fight it.

652
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.830
What do you mean?
I mean, we get a lawyer.

653
00:38:52.832 --> 00:38:54.765
Oh, my God.
Can we do that?

654
00:38:54.767 --> 00:38:56.733
Hell, yeah!
You know what we do?

655
00:38:56.735 --> 00:38:59.035
We'll get a lawyer, and we'll sue the
fucking government for your civil rights.

656
00:38:59.037 --> 00:39:01.504
Johnny,
that's a great idea!

657
00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:03.539
Hey, hey, maybe we get one of them
Harrison Ford lawyers...

658
00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:06.108
who gets shot in the head,
then turns all retarded and nice and goes...

659
00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:09.478
"What we're doing is wrong."
Yes. We get out there, and stick it to them.

660
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.613
Take that shit all the way up
to Judge Judy if we have to.

661
00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:13.781
Yeah. But we don't know
any lawyers.

662
00:39:13.783 --> 00:39:15.415
All our friends make sandwiches.

663
00:39:15.417 --> 00:39:17.517
We just Google "Boston lawyers."
Ah.

664
00:39:19.019 --> 00:39:21.053
Jesus.
Look at<i> that</i> black cock.

665
00:39:41.507 --> 00:39:45.375
Huh. This is a very complicated case
you have here.

666
00:39:46.143 --> 00:39:48.010
Most civil rights cases are,

667
00:39:48.012 --> 00:39:50.846
but this one has some
very obvious wrinkles.

668
00:39:50.848 --> 00:39:52.981
Everybody says
you're the best in town.

669
00:39:52.983 --> 00:39:56.818
Listen, your case
is not gonna be cheap.

670
00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.986
What is
your financial situation?

671
00:39:58.988 --> 00:40:02.556
All of our holdings
are tied up in the railroads.

672
00:40:02.558 --> 00:40:04.858
Yeah, Reading Railroad,
B & O Railroad, Pennsylvania Railroad.

673
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.559
We're working on Short Line.

674
00:40:06.561 --> 00:40:11.697
I own four houses on Baltic Ave. I was thinking
about tearing them down, building a hotel.

675
00:40:11.699 --> 00:40:14.700
I won second prize in a beauty contest.
That's $50 right there.

676
00:40:14.702 --> 00:40:16.768
Are you guys just saying
Monopoly stuff?

677
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.670
I'm gonna go drive around the block,
and I'll be back with $200.

678
00:40:19.672 --> 00:40:21.938
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

679
00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.106
My niece recently
passed her bar exam,

680
00:40:24.108 --> 00:40:27.109
and I've hired her on
as a junior associate here at the firm.

681
00:40:27.111 --> 00:40:29.945
I could assign her
to your case pro bono,

682
00:40:29.947 --> 00:40:31.713
and then you would get
a hungry young attorney,

683
00:40:31.715 --> 00:40:34.816
and I would get
a more experienced lawyer in return.

684
00:40:34.818 --> 00:40:36.484
What do you say to that?

685
00:40:36.486 --> 00:40:39.520
Yeah, sure.
Sounds great.

686
00:40:39.522 --> 00:40:41.488
Uh, are those hard candies,
like, just to take?

687
00:40:42.656 --> 00:40:44.189
Uh, those aren't
supposed to be out.

688
00:40:54.666 --> 00:40:55.799
Hello?

689
00:40:55.801 --> 00:40:59.002
Oh, fuck.

690
00:40:59.004 --> 00:41:00.870
Hi.
Are you okay?

691
00:41:00.872 --> 00:41:04.039
Yeah, I'm fine.
You must be Ted.

692
00:41:04.041 --> 00:41:07.776
Yeah, uh, I'm Ted.
This is my buddy, John.
Hi.

693
00:41:07.778 --> 00:41:11.479
My uncle says that you guys
are my first clients.

694
00:41:11.481 --> 00:41:14.982
Uh, well, it's been discussed,
but, um,

695
00:41:14.984 --> 00:41:18.185
- do you mind if I ask how old you are?
- I'm 26.

696
00:41:18.187 --> 00:41:21.454
- Ah.
- What, is there a problem?

697
00:41:21.456 --> 00:41:25.224
I just don't want my lawyer singing
<i>Frozen</i> songs during the opening arguments.

698
00:41:25.226 --> 00:41:27.159
It's just that
it's a really important case.

699
00:41:27.161 --> 00:41:29.661
Ted has already lost his job.
His marriage has been annulled.

700
00:41:29.663 --> 00:41:31.996
I know. My uncle
gave me all the details.

701
00:41:31.998 --> 00:41:34.164
Right. You see, the thing is, we don't
wanna take any chances...

702
00:41:34.166 --> 00:41:36.566
because the stakes
are so significant.

703
00:41:36.568 --> 00:41:39.135
We can't rush into anything.
We got to make sure we're making the right decision.

704
00:41:39.137 --> 00:41:41.504
We appreciate your time,
but I think what we're gonna do is...

705
00:41:41.506 --> 00:41:43.539
just take a seat
and get to work.

706
00:41:43.541 --> 00:41:46.781
Trust you completely. Yeah, we really
feel like you got a lot to offer.

707
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.711
Sorry. You don't mind the pot, do you?
I get migraines.

708
00:41:51.713 --> 00:41:53.546
Oh, absolutely. Me too.
That's fine.

709
00:41:53.548 --> 00:41:55.881
I'm gonna get a huge migraine
in the parking lot in about 20 minutes.

710
00:41:55.883 --> 00:41:57.816
Oh, I'm Samantha Jackson.

711
00:41:57.818 --> 00:42:00.151
Ted. How are you?
Good to meet you.

712
00:42:00.153 --> 00:42:01.719
John.
Nice to meet you.

713
00:42:01.721 --> 00:42:04.521
Wait, wait wait.
What's your middle name? Leslie.

714
00:42:04.523 --> 00:42:06.256
Oh, my God!

715
00:42:06.258 --> 00:42:08.658
So you're Sam L. Jackson!
That's fucking great!

716
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.093
- Just like Sam L. Jackson!
- Who is that?

717
00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:14.596
You ever seen any movie ever?
He's the black guy.

718
00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:18.666
That weed is really good.

719
00:42:18.668 --> 00:42:21.935
It reminds me of the strain I smoked last
summer called "Here Comes Autism."

720
00:42:21.937 --> 00:42:24.270
Yeah, I was just gonna say it's sort of
like this other batch we had called...

721
00:42:24.272 --> 00:42:26.205
"How Long Has That Van
Been There?"

722
00:42:26.207 --> 00:42:29.608
No, it's this new strain my dealer
gave me called "Help Me Get Home."

723
00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.110
I'm surprised
a lawyer like you gets high.

724
00:42:32.112 --> 00:42:34.946
Aren't you supposed to be
fightin' the war on drugs and that shit?

725
00:42:34.948 --> 00:42:37.148
Please, the war on drugs
is a joke.

726
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:40.017
It's just a way for the government
to inflate law enforcement budgets...

727
00:42:40.019 --> 00:42:42.786
and lock up minorities
for no good legal reason.

728
00:42:42.788 --> 00:42:45.188
And you, my friend,
are an oppressed minority.

729
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:47.690
Yeah.
No shit.

730
00:42:47.692 --> 00:42:50.959
They've denied you the same rights as
everybody else just because you're different,

731
00:42:50.961 --> 00:42:53.661
and I say that's a violation
of the Constitution.

732
00:42:53.663 --> 00:42:55.863
Well, so what do you say?
Can you get me my life back?

733
00:42:59.933 --> 00:43:00.966
I'm gonna try.

734
00:43:00.968 --> 00:43:03.935
Hey, guys?

735
00:43:03.937 --> 00:43:06.170
- I'm having some trouble over here.
- What's the matter?

736
00:43:06.172 --> 00:43:10.073
Can you help me get home?

737
00:43:10.075 --> 00:43:12.842
I'm having
a really hard time here, guys.

738
00:43:12.844 --> 00:43:14.877
Johnny, it's okay, buddy.
You're doing fine.

739
00:43:14.879 --> 00:43:16.612
You're doing great.
No, I'm scared.

740
00:43:16.614 --> 00:43:19.881
It's okay, though.
You just have to hang onto the wall.

741
00:43:19.883 --> 00:43:22.950
Don't let the goose get me!

742
00:43:22.952 --> 00:43:26.286
How far away does he live?
About a mile and a half.

743
00:43:26.288 --> 00:43:28.888
Fuck, okay.

Well,
it's a little different.

795
00:46:25.695 --> 00:46:29.263
Ted, if you legally become a person,
you're gonna need a last name.

796
00:46:29.265 --> 00:46:31.231
Oh, yeah, you're right.

797
00:46:31.233 --> 00:46:32.999
Okay, okay, I got one.

798
00:46:33.001 --> 00:46:36.235
- Okay, what is it?
- Last name of a movie character.

799
00:46:36.237 --> 00:46:38.704
Ah.

800
00:46:38.706 --> 00:46:41.373

00:47:09.029 --> 00:47:11.796
The boxing... You've never seen<i> Rocky?</i>
She's not serious.

818
00:47:11.798 --> 00:47:13.130
You've never seen<i> Rocky?</i>

819
00:47:13.132 --> 00:47:17.367
You know...

820
00:47:17.369 --> 00:47:18.801
You know,<i> Rocky!</i>

821
00:47:18.803 --> 00:47:20.903
I'm not gonna remember
a movie I've never seen...

822
00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:22.771
just because you're singing
a song I don't know.

823
00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:25.306
You don't know Samuel L. Jackson.
You don't know<i> Rocky.</i>

824
00:47:25.308 --> 00:47:27.141
You are literally
pop-culture illiterate.

825
00:47:27.143 --> 00:47:29.243
I have a college degree.

826
00:47:29.245 --> 00:47:32.145
My pop-culture references are Hamlet,
Achilles, Dorian Gray. Ever heard of<i> them?</i>

827
00:47:32.147 --> 00:47:35.081
No, but I'm pretty sure
Mr. T could kick their ass!

828
00:47:35.083 --> 00:47:36.882
Yeah, Sam, you really
need to be educated.

829
00:47:36.884 --> 00:47:38.483
Oh, really? Um,

830
00:47:38.485 --> 00:47:41.385
can either of you tell me
who wrote<i> The Great Gatsby?</i>

831
00:47:41.387 --> 00:47:42.919
Judy Blume?
Hitler?

832
00:47:42.921 --> 00:47:44.186
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

833
00:47:44.188 --> 00:47:46.755
- Who's that?
- The author.

834
00:47:46.757 --> 00:47:49.157
- Why are you saying "Fuck him"?
- What?

835
00:47:49.159 --> 00:47:50.892
You just said,
"Eff Scott Fitzgerald."

836
00:47:50.894 --> 00:47:52.460
What did Scott Fitzgerald do to you?
Yeah.

837
00:47:52.462 --> 00:47:54.395
No, that's his first name.

838
00:47:54.397 --> 00:47:57.765
- His name's "Fuck Scott Fitzgerald"?
- What? No.

839
00:47:57.767 --> 00:48:00.000
- Well, then, what's the F stand for?
- Francis.

840
00:48:00.002 --> 00:48:01.468
No. Got to be Fuck.
It must be Fuck.

841
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:03.169
Gotta be Fuck.
It has to be Fuck.

842
00:48:03.171 --> 00:48:06.172
- Why would it be Fuck?
- Otherwise, why wouldn't he say it?

843
00:48:06.174 --> 00:48:08.174
He's hiding something.
It's Fuck. Read between the lines, Sam.

844
00:48:08.176 --> 00:48:11.877
That's completely insane.
You guys are idiots.

845
00:48:11.879 --> 00:48:14.959
Yeah, well, whatever.
Ted Clubber Lang.
Get used to it.

846
00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:21.430
Yes?

847
00:48:23.887 --> 00:48:27.789
Sir? Um, one of the janitors
would like to see you.

848
00:48:27.791 --> 00:48:29.123
I'm busy.

849
00:48:29.125 --> 00:48:31.091
Fresh cakes.

850
00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:34.793
- What is it, Danny?
- Donny, sir.

851
00:48:34.795 --> 00:48:38.296
Donny, I'm extremely busy
with the Comic Con presentations, so...

852
00:48:38.298 --> 00:48:40.431
I'm told that you have
an open-door policy here at Hasbro...

853
00:48:40.433 --> 00:48:43.000
for new toy ideas from
any and all employees?

854
00:48:44.168 --> 00:48:46.435
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

855
00:48:46.437 --> 00:48:48.437
All right, come in.

856
00:48:48.439 --> 00:48:51.139
Okay.
Thank you.

857
00:48:51.141 --> 00:48:53.007
Thank you.
I love your dress.

858
00:48:56.578 --> 00:48:59.379
I love these things!

859
00:48:59.381 --> 00:49:01.147
Look at this!

860
00:49:04.851 --> 00:49:06.351
Don't touch my pony.

861
00:49:06.353 --> 00:49:08.019
Sorry.

862
00:49:10.389 --> 00:49:14.358
Mr. Jessup, I can make this company
a billion dollars.

863
00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.194
I'm listening.

864
00:49:17.196 --> 00:49:19.930
Thirty years ago,
a little boy named John Bennett...

865
00:49:19.932 --> 00:49:22.832
made a wish that his teddy bear
would come to life.

866
00:49:22.834 --> 00:49:25.267
Somehow,
one of our Hasbro bears...

867
00:49:25.269 --> 00:49:27.629
Yes, I'm aware of the story.

868
00:49:28.904 --> 00:49:30.404
Have you seen this?

869
00:49:35.077 --> 00:49:36.910
So what?

870
00:49:36.912 --> 00:49:40.546
Well, Ted is suing
for his civil rights.

871
00:49:40.548 --> 00:49:44.149
If he loses, the state
will officially declare him a non-entity...

872
00:49:44.151 --> 00:49:45.917
with no rights under the law.

873
00:49:45.919 --> 00:49:48.519
That means he becomes property.

874
00:49:48.521 --> 00:49:51.522
Mr. Jessup,

875
00:49:51.524 --> 00:49:55.492
we could take him back, with only
a trivial degree of legal consequence...

876
00:49:55.494 --> 00:49:57.227
if we were even caught.

877
00:49:57.229 --> 00:49:59.095
And why would we do this?

878
00:49:59.097 --> 00:50:04.266
Sir, if we could cut him open
to see what makes him tick,

879
00:50:04.268 --> 00:50:08.370
we could manufacture millions of
Teds for every child in the world.

880
00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:10.638
Hasbro would double
its profits overnight.

881
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.140
Go on.

882
00:50:13.142 --> 00:50:16.076
We-We just have to make sure
Ted loses the case.

883
00:50:16.078 --> 00:50:19.279
You use every back channel,
every bribe,

884
00:50:19.281 --> 00:50:21.047
you call in every favor...

885
00:50:21.049 --> 00:50:25.384
and you get the best lawyer
in the world on the defense.

886
00:50:25.586 --> 00:50:28.619
When Ted's rights
are officially null,

887
00:50:30.288 --> 00:50:31.688
we grab him.

888
00:50:33.257 --> 00:50:37.293
No one's going to kick up
a legal fuss over property.

889
00:50:37.295 --> 00:50:40.129
You're a hell of a lot smarter
than your urinal cakes, Danny.

890
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:41.663
Really?

891
00:50:41.665 --> 00:50:44.399
Now, what exactly
do you want from this?

892
00:50:44.401 --> 00:50:47.435
Mr. Jessup,
I'm not interested in money.

893
00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:52.540
I just want a Ted
for my very own.

894
00:50:53.775 --> 00:50:57.577
All right. I think I can handle
the defense.

895
00:50:57.579 --> 00:50:59.245
But let's make one thing clear.

896
00:50:59.247 --> 00:51:01.447
We never had this conversation.

897
00:51:01.449 --> 00:51:05.350
Goldner and the board cannot
know about this until we have him.

898
00:51:05.352 --> 00:51:08.186
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.

899
00:51:11.291 --> 00:51:14.324
I need Shep Wild.

900
00:51:16.427 --> 00:51:19.195
That was such a good dinner,
Tami-Lynn.

901
00:51:19.197 --> 00:51:22.565
I've never had Pringles on my steak before.
It's my pleasure.

902
00:51:22.567 --> 00:51:25.901
It's the least I can do
with all you're doing for us. Really.

903
00:51:25.903 --> 00:51:28.236
Well, I haven't
done anything yet.

904
00:51:28.238 --> 00:51:30.137
We wanted to take you
out to dinner,

905
00:51:30.139 --> 00:51:33.807
but all we got is Tami's income these days
since nobody will hire me.

906
00:51:33.809 --> 00:51:35.542
Things are getting
really tight, huh?

907
00:51:35.544 --> 00:51:38.244
Yeah, I've had to do
some things I'm not proud of.

908
00:51:38.246 --> 00:51:40.312
BJ's here!
Get your BJ's!

909
00:51:40.314 --> 00:51:43.248
Get your red-hot BJ's!
Toothless and ready to go.

910
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.717
Just three dollar! Three dollar!
Get your BJ's here.

911
00:51:45.719 --> 00:51:47.452
Wow.

912
00:51:47.454 --> 00:51:48.920
Hey, listen,
I got an idea.

913
00:51:48.922 --> 00:51:51.589
Tami, what do you say
you and me go do the dishes...

914
00:51:51.591 --> 00:51:54.358
and give Sam and Diane here
some alone time, huh?

915
00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.593
All right, all right.

916
00:51:56.595 --> 00:51:59.395
Hey, you go pull a bad back,
bitch!

917
00:52:00.597 --> 00:52:02.698
What do you think
that was about?

918
00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.200
Oh, it's nothing. That's his way of saying
I should ask you out.

919
00:52:05.202 --> 00:52:06.868
Ah.
Yeah, look.

920
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:09.637
We should probably focus
our attention on the case for now.

921
00:52:09.639 --> 00:52:12.206
I completely agree.

922
00:52:12.208 --> 00:52:14.508
You know,
I am a little bit curious.

923
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.811
How is it that a guy like you
is unattached?

924
00:52:17.813 --> 00:52:22.182
Well, I-I was married at one point,
but it just didn't work out.

925
00:52:22.184 --> 00:52:24.617
Shit. I'm sorry.
That sucks.

926
00:52:24.619 --> 00:52:27.720
No. I mean, we'd make it work
day to day,

927
00:52:27.722 --> 00:52:31.356
but she was always just trying
to change me into someone I'm not.

928
00:52:31.358 --> 00:52:33.624
And I tried, you know?

929
00:52:33.626 --> 00:52:38.528
I really tried everything I could to be
the man that she wanted.

930
00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:42.698
One day I woke up, and I just
realized I wasn't myself anymore.

931
00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:47.235
You know? As much as I love this person,
we're completely wrong for each other.

932
00:52:47.237 --> 00:52:50.204
At least
you figured it out early.

933
00:52:50.206 --> 00:52:53.646
Some people go through their whole lives
trying to make it work with the wrong person.

934
00:52:53.807 --> 00:52:54.973
Yeah.

935
00:52:56.375 --> 00:52:57.842
So, we're gonna win this thing?

936
00:52:57.844 --> 00:53:00.311
Honestly, I don't know.

937
00:53:00.313 --> 00:53:02.746
Well, we're betting on you.

938
00:53:02.748 --> 00:53:05.582
Hey, Johnny, come on.
It's almost 7:00. We got to get up there.

939
00:53:05.584 --> 00:53:07.750
- Hey, Sam, you want in on this?
- What is it?

940
00:53:07.752 --> 00:53:10.452
Tuesday nights, we get fucked up
and throw apples at joggers.

941
00:53:15.257 --> 00:53:17.725
Oh, there's one!

942
00:53:17.727 --> 00:53:19.493
- How's your workout?
- Fuck you!

943
00:53:19.495 --> 00:53:20.961
Eat my pussy!
Have some apples!

944
00:53:20.963 --> 00:53:22.595
Jesus, what the hell
is your problem?

945
00:53:22.597 --> 00:53:26.665
It's everybody else's fault,
Mary Decker!

946
00:53:26.667 --> 00:53:29.501
You sons of bitches!
What the fuck is your...

947
00:53:32.005 --> 00:53:34.672
That's the lottery!
That's the lottery!

948
00:53:34.674 --> 00:53:37.441
That's what you get
for fucking exercising!

949
00:53:37.443 --> 00:53:40.403
That is unbelievable!

950
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:17.312
Teddy.
Teddy, I'm scared.

951
00:54:17.314 --> 00:54:18.946
Baby, we're gonna be fine.

952
00:54:18.948 --> 00:54:22.282
I don't care what any fucking
piece of paper says. You're my wife.

953
00:54:22.284 --> 00:54:24.584
I love you so much.

954
00:54:24.586 --> 00:54:27.286
I swear to God, if we lose,
I'm gonna fucking cut that judge.

955
00:54:27.288 --> 00:54:29.988
Wait a minute.
You brought your switchblade?
Yeah.

956
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:32.457
But they patted us down on the way in here.
Where'd you even hide it?

957
00:54:32.459 --> 00:54:34.392
Oh!

958
00:54:34.926 --> 00:54:36.860
Hey, Sam,

959
00:54:36.862 --> 00:54:38.662
who's that buttnut over there?

960
00:54:41.064 --> 00:54:43.999
That is why we've been working so hard.
That's Shep Wild.

961
00:54:44.001 --> 00:54:46.868
It's our bad luck
they put him on the trial.

962
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:48.669
He's never lost a case
in his life.

963
00:54:48.671 --> 00:54:52.773
Mr. Wild, your opening statement,
if you please.

964
00:54:52.775 --> 00:54:55.375
Thank you, Your Honor.

965
00:54:55.377 --> 00:54:58.511
I would first like to thank
the ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

966
00:54:58.513 --> 00:55:01.780
for taking time out
of their busy schedules...

967
00:55:01.782 --> 00:55:04.315
to be a part
of these proceedings.

968
00:55:04.317 --> 00:55:09.419
Now, the case we'll be examining today
is really quite a simple one.

969
00:55:09.421 --> 00:55:11.954
Is Ted a human being...

970
00:55:11.956 --> 00:55:13.889
or a piece of property?

971
00:55:14.991 --> 00:55:17.859
You know, it really is
a very special,

972
00:55:17.861 --> 00:55:21.662
very... unique thing
to be human.

973
00:55:21.664 --> 00:55:27.600
It's a gift from God bestowed
upon only one species... Us.

974
00:55:27.602 --> 00:55:31.370
But if we suddenly decide
to share that gift,

975
00:55:31.372 --> 00:55:33.438
where does that lead us?

976
00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.373
Does your dog deserve
human rights?

977
00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:38.476
Your cat?
Your toaster?

978
00:55:41.581 --> 00:55:45.583
Suddenly, being human
doesn't seem so special anymore, does it?

979
00:55:45.585 --> 00:55:49.720
I'm confident you'll make
the right decision.

980
00:55:49.722 --> 00:55:52.622
Thank you, Mr. Wild,
for your opening statement.

981
00:55:52.624 --> 00:55:53.856
Ms. Jackson?

982
00:56:00.129 --> 00:56:04.065
Hi.
I am Samantha Jackson.

983
00:56:04.067 --> 00:56:08.668
I gotta be honest with you.
I'm... I'm a little nervous.

984
00:56:09.503 --> 00:56:12.037
Why am I nervous?
Um...

985
00:56:12.039 --> 00:56:16.775
Not because I'm a junior attorney
arguing her first case.

986
00:56:16.777 --> 00:56:21.479
And not because some of you might laugh at
the fact that I'm representing a teddy bear.

987
00:56:24.015 --> 00:56:28.517
No, I'm-I'm nervous
because of one simple word.

988
00:56:30.953 --> 00:56:33.421
"Justice."

989
00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:37.158
I'm nervous that
you're going to be swayed...

990
00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:41.595
by smooth talk and a haircut,

991
00:56:41.597 --> 00:56:45.664
and forget about the most
important aspect of this case.

992
00:56:46.766 --> 00:56:48.399
Justice.

993
00:56:49.801 --> 00:56:53.804
150 years ago,
a slave by the name of Dred Scott...

994
00:56:53.806 --> 00:56:56.907
sued to prove that he was a
person and not a piece of property.

995
00:56:57.575 --> 00:56:59.142
He lost.

996
00:56:59.144 --> 00:57:03.479
And as history has shown us,
that wasn't justice.

997
00:57:05.582 --> 00:57:08.984
In every civil rights conflict,

998
00:57:08.986 --> 00:57:15.189
we are only able to recognize the just
point of view years after the fact.

999
00:57:15.191 --> 00:57:17.724
And when the next conflict
comes along,

1000
00:57:17.726 --> 00:57:21.861
we're once again
blind to it as it's happening.

1001
00:57:21.863 --> 00:57:26.532
"Well, this is different,"
we say. But it isn't.

1002
00:57:26.534 --> 00:57:29.635
It is the same beast
just wearing a different face...

1003
00:57:29.637 --> 00:57:31.797
and it's happening again today.

1004
00:57:32.638 --> 00:57:36.507
So I urge you,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1005
00:57:36.509 --> 00:57:39.869
not to be a footnote
on the wrong side of history.

1006
00:57:41.912 --> 00:57:44.112
Don't wait too long to be right.

1007
00:57:45.581 --> 00:57:47.514
Thank you.

1008
00:57:50.684 --> 00:57:53.552
- Erection.
- Sustained.

1009
00:57:56.055 --> 00:58:00.058
Ms. McCafferty, you and Ted recently
considered adopting a child. Is that correct?

1010
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.692
Yeah.

1011
00:58:01.694 --> 00:58:03.794
If I may inquire,

1012
00:58:03.796 --> 00:58:06.630
why did you not choose
to have a child of your own?

1013
00:58:06.632 --> 00:58:08.064
'Cause Teddy ain't got no dick.

1014
00:58:12.202 --> 00:58:17.873
And why does Ted not possess
a, uh, male appendage?

1015
00:58:17.875 --> 00:58:19.641
Is it a freak of genetics?

1016
00:58:19.643 --> 00:58:22.110
No, asshole. He ain't got a dick
'cause he's a fucking toy!

1017
00:58:22.112 --> 00:58:25.113
- What's your excuse?
- Oh! Take a burn!

1018
00:58:25.115 --> 00:58:27.215
Yeah! How's your tongue taste
in your own ass, Poindexter?

1019
00:58:27.217 --> 00:58:28.849
Yeah! How'd you...
What?

1020
00:58:28.851 --> 00:58:30.984
Order!

1021
00:58:30.986 --> 00:58:36.789
Mr. Bennett, how would you categorize
your relationship with Ted?

1022
00:58:37.791 --> 00:58:38.957
He's my best friend.

1023
00:58:38.959 --> 00:58:41.693
So you don't see him
as your property.

1024
00:58:41.695 --> 00:58:44.662
No, he's not my property.
He's a person.

1025
00:58:44.664 --> 00:58:46.730
He's way more of a person
than lots of other people.

1026
00:58:46.732 --> 00:58:48.932
Fucking Steven Tyler?
What the fuck is that?

1027
00:58:48.934 --> 00:58:51.034
Some kind of weird soccer-mom
looking Goonie monster?

1028
00:58:51.036 --> 00:58:52.735
- Your Honor?
- I'll allow it.

1029
00:58:52.737 --> 00:58:54.837
Thank you, Your Honor.

1030
00:58:54.839 --> 00:58:56.171
Your witness.

1031
00:59:00.009 --> 00:59:04.512
Mr. Bennett, when and where did you
first encounter Ted?

1032
00:59:04.514 --> 00:59:06.947
What do you mean?
My parents got him for me when I was a kid.

1033
00:59:06.949 --> 00:59:09.616
Aha. They "got him."

1034
00:59:10.751 --> 00:59:12.084
Where did they get him?

1035
00:59:14.921 --> 00:59:16.621
Child World toy store.

1036
00:59:16.623 --> 00:59:18.155
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear.
Could you repeat that?

1037
00:59:18.157 --> 00:59:20.123
Child World toy store.
You fucking heard me.

1038
00:59:20.125 --> 00:59:22.992
There's no need for hostility,
Mr. Bennett. Why? Nobody here likes you!

1039
00:59:22.994 --> 00:59:25.127
I saw you eating lunch alone!
You're a loser!

1040
00:59:25.129 --> 00:59:26.194
- Your Honor?
- Mr. Bennett.

1041
00:59:26.196 --> 00:59:27.762
I hope your kids get bird flu.

1042
00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:30.030
Mr. Bennett!
I'm sorry.

1043
00:59:30.032 --> 00:59:33.166
Now, you said
your parents purchased Ted...

1044
00:59:33.168 --> 00:59:36.802
as one might purchase a baseball glove
or a Big Wheel.

1045
00:59:36.804 --> 00:59:39.037
- No, it's not like that!
- Objection!

1046
00:59:39.039 --> 00:59:41.973
- <i>You</i> can't do that.
- You know what? This is bullshit!

1047
00:59:41.975 --> 00:59:45.009
This court is trying to tell me that
I'm not as good as other people...

1048
00:59:45.011 --> 00:59:47.177
and this is exactly what
you've been doing to the fags!

1049
00:59:47.179 --> 00:59:49.779
- Ted!
- Sorry, sorry. The homos, the homos.

1050
00:59:49.781 --> 00:59:52.615
This is exactly what you've been
doing to the homos, and I say it's wrong!

1051
00:59:52.617 --> 00:59:55.250
Ms. Jackson,
please control your client...

1052
00:59:55.252 --> 00:59:57.552
or I'll hold both of you
in contempt of court.

1053
00:59:57.554 --> 00:59:59.086
Oh, piss off!
All right?

1054
00:59:59.088 --> 01:00:01.321
I'm standing up for me,
and I'm standing up for the homos!

1055
01:00:01.323 --> 01:00:03.289
- We deserve respect!
- Ted, shut up!

1056
01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:04.957
Fine.

1057
01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.301
Your Honor, I'd like to call
Ted Clubber Lang to the stand.

1058
01:00:16.303 --> 01:00:17.969
Yes!

1059
01:00:17.971 --> 01:00:19.971
My turn, assholes.

1060
01:00:25.009 --> 01:00:28.711
Ted, do you love your wife?

1061
01:00:28.713 --> 01:00:31.246
Objection. She's not his wife.
The marriage was annulled.

1062
01:00:31.248 --> 01:00:33.014
I'll rephrase.

1063
01:00:34.049 --> 01:00:35.783
Do you love Tami-Lynn?

1064
01:00:35.785 --> 01:00:39.153
I love my<i> wife.</i>
Okay? My<i> wife...</i>

1065
01:00:39.155 --> 01:00:41.054
more than anything in the world.

1066
01:00:41.056 --> 01:00:42.955
We're married.
I don't care what anybody says.

1067
01:00:42.957 --> 01:00:48.860
So you're saying you are
capable of feeling love. Yeah.

1068
01:00:48.862 --> 01:00:52.029
Hey, it must be weird for you guys,
having a doll up here on the stand...

1069
01:00:52.031 --> 01:00:55.165
with no kid pointing to where
his uncle touched him, huh?

1070
01:00:55.167 --> 01:00:58.001
Yeah, no, yeah, no.
Yeah, I am capable.

1071
01:00:58.003 --> 01:00:59.736
I love a lot of stuff.

1072
01:00:59.738 --> 01:01:04.373
Ted, do you believe
you have a soul?

1073
01:01:06.008 --> 01:01:11.779
♪ What did you think
I would do at this moment ♪

1074
01:01:11.781 --> 01:01:14.681
♪ When you're standing
before me ♪

1075
01:01:14.683 --> 01:01:17.850
♪ With tears
in your eyes? ♪♪

1076
01:01:17.852 --> 01:01:19.284
That answer your question?

1077
01:01:19.286 --> 01:01:20.818
Objection.
Your Honor.

1078
01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.853
Overruled.

1079
01:01:22.855 --> 01:01:26.122
What it is, man.
Dynomite.

1080
01:01:26.124 --> 01:01:29.058
- Ted.
- Right, right. Sorry, sorry.

1081
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:33.095
Look,
I'm not a scientist, okay?

1082
01:01:33.097 --> 01:01:36.798
I don't know exactly
what makes a person a person.

1083
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.002
All I know is I feel stuff,
just like all you guys.

1084
01:01:41.004 --> 01:01:44.171
And I don't think
I ought to be treated any different.

1085
01:01:48.276 --> 01:01:49.843
Capable of love.

1086
01:01:51.011 --> 01:01:53.491
Aware of his own consciousness.

1087
01:01:55.948 --> 01:01:57.868
Seems pretty human to me.

1088
01:01:58.717 --> 01:02:00.217
No further questions.

1089
01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:03.186
Mr. Kidder,

1090
01:02:03.188 --> 01:02:07.023
you were an employee at Hasbro
from 1976 to 1998. Is that correct?

1091
01:02:07.025 --> 01:02:10.126
Yes, I supervised the stuffing
of the teddy bears.

1092
01:02:10.128 --> 01:02:14.363
- And what is that stuffing made of?
- A synthetic cotton-poly blend.

1093
01:02:14.365 --> 01:02:16.264
Is there anything else in there?

1094
01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:20.368
The bear products are affixed
with an electronic device in the chest...

1095
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:24.705
which can be programmed to say
any one of five phrases.

1096
01:02:25.339 --> 01:02:26.939
Hmm.

1097
01:02:29.709 --> 01:02:33.110
Ted, would you please
press your chest?

1098
01:02:35.213 --> 01:02:36.713
What?

1099
01:02:36.715 --> 01:02:39.716
Please follow the instruction,
Mr. Clubber Lang.

1100
01:02:44.887 --> 01:02:46.821
<i>I love you!</i>

1101
01:02:56.764 --> 01:02:58.464
No further questions.

1102
01:03:01.134 --> 01:03:03.034
<i>Also in the news,
a pending court case...</i>

1103
01:03:03.036 --> 01:03:07.104
<i>is beginning to get national attention
for its civil rights ramifications.</i>

1104
01:03:07.106 --> 01:03:09.940
<i>Ted, the bear, who some of you
may remember came to life...</i>

1105
01:03:09.942 --> 01:03:12.842
<i>back in the mid-'80s
right here in Boston...</i>

1106
01:03:12.844 --> 01:03:15.945
<i>is suing to prove
he is, indeed, a person.</i>

1107
01:03:15.947 --> 01:03:18.881
<i>Okay, so what are we even
talking about here?</i>

1108
01:03:18.883 --> 01:03:21.216
<i>What we're talking about
is a civil rights issue.</i>

1109
01:03:21.418 --> 01:03:23.184
<i>This bear has rights.</i>

1110
01:03:23.186 --> 01:03:25.052
<i>Oh, come on!
He does not! He's a toy.</i>

1111
01:03:25.054 --> 01:03:26.653
<i>Then why are you
calling it a "he"?</i>

1112
01:03:26.655 --> 01:03:29.055
<i>Look, we call
the Statue of Liberty "she,"</i>

1113
01:03:29.057 --> 01:03:31.991
<i>but we all know it's an
object made of copper and steel.</i>

1114
01:03:31.993 --> 01:03:33.559
<i>Oh, good point.</i>

1115
01:03:33.561 --> 01:03:36.595
<i>Yes, but she isn't
conscious or sentient. He is.</i>

1116
01:03:36.597 --> 01:03:38.597
<i>Now, come on!</i>

1117
01:03:38.599 --> 01:03:41.499
<i>Are any of you gonna sit there and tell
me that this stuffed doll is a person?</i>

1118
01:03:41.501 --> 01:03:44.034
<i>No. Not at all.
We all agree all the time.</i>

1119
01:03:44.036 --> 01:03:47.003
So, the big story out of Boston
is that Ted, the bear,

1120
01:03:47.005 --> 01:03:49.405
is suing to prove
that he's a person.

1121
01:03:49.407 --> 01:03:51.306
Legal experts are closely
watching this case.

1122
01:03:51.308 --> 01:03:53.207
They said if Ted wins,

1123
01:03:53.209 --> 01:03:56.343
Donald Trump's hair would
look to quickly file a similar lawsuit.

1124
01:03:56.345 --> 01:03:59.546
So... I think it might be...
it might be real.

1125
01:03:59.548 --> 01:04:02.348
I don't think he should want
to be considered a person.

1126
01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:05.651
After all, Ted spent many
years sleeping and cuddling with a child.

1127
01:04:05.653 --> 01:04:07.953
That's cute when
you're a stuffed animal.

1128
01:04:07.955 --> 01:04:11.556
When you're a person,
that's a felony.

1129
01:04:11.558 --> 01:04:15.459
This sounds like a silly case,
but this is actually a really big case.

1130
01:04:15.461 --> 01:04:18.962
The last time someone named Ted
made this much news in Massachusetts,

1131
01:04:18.964 --> 01:04:20.730
he drove a chick into a lake.

1132
01:04:22.633 --> 01:04:26.001
Ted, do you have anything
to say in your own defense?

1133
01:04:26.003 --> 01:04:30.738
I am not an animal!

1134
01:04:34.043 --> 01:04:36.610
You see, Your Honor?
He's not an animal.

1135
01:04:45.284 --> 01:04:48.419
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I'm on my period.

1136
01:04:48.421 --> 01:04:53.724
And live from New York,
it's<i> Saturday Night!</i>

1137
01:05:11.509 --> 01:05:13.376
What is taking them so long?

1138
01:05:13.378 --> 01:05:15.277
Is it bad
that they're taking this long?

1139
01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:19.047
It's not good or bad. It just means
that they're probably having a debate.

1140
01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:22.383
- Johnny, it may be time to play the Beetlejuice card.
- What do you mean?

1141
01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:25.018
- I mean saying his name three times.
- What?

1142
01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.087
- Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.
- Shut up!

1143
01:05:28.089 --> 01:05:30.389
You fucking crazy? We don't want
that guy running around in here.

1144
01:05:30.391 --> 01:05:32.491
No, Johnny, he'll be on our side.
He'll help us.

1145
01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:35.093
- Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice...
- You are meddling with powers you do not understand.

1146
01:05:35.095 --> 01:05:36.461
Cut the shit.

1147
01:05:48.539 --> 01:05:49.705
Please be seated.

1148
01:05:52.642 --> 01:05:56.111
Mr. Willer, has the jury
reached a verdict?

1149
01:05:56.113 --> 01:05:58.113
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1150
01:05:58.115 --> 01:06:02.417
Um, in the case of <i>Ted v. the Commonwealth</i>
<i>of Massachusetts,</i>

1151
01:06:02.419 --> 01:06:05.253
we the jury find
for the commonwealth...

1152
01:06:05.255 --> 01:06:08.256
in that Ted is not a person.

1153
01:06:20.334 --> 01:06:24.402
Very well. The plaintiff is hereby
legally deemed property.

1154
01:06:24.404 --> 01:06:27.671
The definition entails
the rights thereof,

1155
01:06:27.673 --> 01:06:29.739
and will be recognized
in the terms set...

1156
01:06:29.741 --> 01:06:32.742
by the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.

1157
01:06:32.744 --> 01:06:35.511
The court wishes
to thank the jury for its service.

1158
01:06:42.585 --> 01:06:44.652
Are you sure
you can get him?

1159
01:06:44.654 --> 01:06:46.854
Remember, you're
on your own out there.

1160
01:06:46.856 --> 01:06:48.622
Hasbro can have
no connection to this.

1161
01:06:48.624 --> 01:06:51.191
Oh, I'll get him.

1162
01:06:51.193 --> 01:06:53.393
And when I have him,
I'll call you with the code phrase.

1163
01:06:54.327 --> 01:06:55.827
Do you remember what it is?

1164
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:57.628
Yes, I remember it.

1165
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:59.696
Should we say it just for safety?
No, that's not necessary.

1166
01:06:59.698 --> 01:07:01.130
Say it.
I don't wanna say...

1167
01:07:01.132 --> 01:07:02.731
I don't have to...
Just say it.

1168
01:07:02.733 --> 01:07:05.834
Fresh cakes.
Fresh cakes.

1169
01:07:13.809 --> 01:07:16.243
This isn't fucking fair.

1170
01:07:16.245 --> 01:07:18.345
Teddy's a good man.

1171
01:07:18.347 --> 01:07:21.214
Why is he being treated differently
than everybody else?

1172
01:07:21.216 --> 01:07:23.849
It's what this country does best...

1173
01:07:23.851 --> 01:07:26.184
Putting different people
into little groups...

1174
01:07:26.186 --> 01:07:28.719
and making them watch Tyler Perry.
It's wrong!

1175
01:07:29.854 --> 01:07:32.655
- I'm so sorry, baby.
- No, I'm sorry.

1176
01:07:32.657 --> 01:07:35.591
I thought I'd built
a better case.

1177
01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:38.594
It's just, the reality is you have
a really shitty lawyer.

1178
01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:40.729
Hey, come on.
Nobody's blaming you for this.

1179
01:07:40.731 --> 01:07:42.497
You did everything you could.

1180
01:07:42.499 --> 01:07:47.335
I just... I'm sitting here,
and I can't believe it's official.

1181
01:07:47.337 --> 01:07:49.337
All right, so what
are we gonna do now?

1182
01:07:49.339 --> 01:07:51.772
I mean, we can't take this lying down, right?
We gotta do something.

1183
01:07:51.774 --> 01:07:54.141
You know what we're gonna do?

1184
01:07:54.143 --> 01:07:56.776
- We're gonna call Patrick Meighan.
- Who's that?

1185
01:07:56.778 --> 01:07:59.712
He is the top
civil rights attorney in America.

1186
01:07:59.714 --> 01:08:02.414
Wait. Is he the one who got that
female midget into the marines?

1187
01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:04.916
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that had a sad ending though. You remember?

1188
01:08:04.918 --> 01:08:07.385
She was at a Veterans Day parade,
somebody handed her a bunch of balloons and...

1189
01:08:07.387 --> 01:08:09.153
Pfft!
She's gone.

1190
01:08:09.155 --> 01:08:11.421
- It was very sad. Very sad for the family.
- You know what?

1191
01:08:11.423 --> 01:08:13.689
If anyone can get
this verdict overturned, it's him.

1192
01:08:13.691 --> 01:08:16.692
He's not cheap, but we've become
such a high-profile case,

1193
01:08:16.694 --> 01:08:18.927
I feel like he might
take it pro bono.

1194
01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:20.662
He's a sucker for media.

1195
01:08:24.566 --> 01:08:27.646
- Hey, Johnny, how about a beer, huh?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

1196
01:08:28.802 --> 01:08:30.335
Hi. I'm calling
for Patrick Meighan.

1197
01:08:30.337 --> 01:08:31.736
This is Samantha Jackson.

1198
01:08:31.738 --> 01:08:34.805
I defended Ted Clubber Lang
in<i> Ted v. Massachusetts.</i>

1199
01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.941
- Hey!
- Hi. Mr. Meighan.

1200
01:08:38.943 --> 01:08:42.678
Thank you so much
for taking my call.

1201
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:45.280
Oh, you've been following the case?
That's great.

1202
01:08:45.282 --> 01:08:48.650
Yeah, that's actually
why I'm calling.

1203
01:08:48.652 --> 01:08:51.386
Yeah, I was wondering...

1204
01:08:51.388 --> 01:08:54.948
if maybe you would consider
helping us try to overturn the verdict.

1205
01:08:56.757 --> 01:09:00.826
Well, yeah. It would have to be
a pro bono situation...

1206
01:09:00.828 --> 01:09:02.961
because we're not really working
with much money,

1207
01:09:02.963 --> 01:09:04.662
but I think
you'll be impressed with my client.

1208
01:09:04.664 --> 01:09:06.930
Oh!
Ha, ha, motherfucker!

1209
01:09:06.932 --> 01:09:09.732
Sure. Yeah, great.

1210
01:09:09.734 --> 01:09:11.767
Okay. Thank you so much.

1211
01:09:11.769 --> 01:09:14.469
Okay, I'll see you then.
Bye.

1212
01:09:14.471 --> 01:09:16.737
Oh, my God!
He said he'll meet with us...

1213
01:09:16.739 --> 01:09:18.872
on Friday at 9:00 AM
at his office in New York.

1214
01:09:18.874 --> 01:09:22.775
- Is he gonna take the case?
- I don't wanna jinx it, but I think so.

1215
01:09:22.777 --> 01:09:26.378
Oh, my God!
You hear that, Johnny?
I still got a shot!

1216
01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:29.381
- We got to celebrate.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1217
01:09:29.383 --> 01:09:32.650
- Let's go down to the Improv and yell sad suggestions?
- Fuck, yeah!

1218
01:09:32.652 --> 01:09:35.853
So first we need a historical event.
Who's got an event?

1219
01:09:35.855 --> 01:09:39.723
- 9/11.
- Okay. Maybe something else.

1220
01:09:39.725 --> 01:09:41.391
All right,
let's start with a person.

1221
01:09:41.393 --> 01:09:42.658
Robin Williams.

1222
01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.393
Okay, all right, for real, guys.
For real.

1223
01:09:44.395 --> 01:09:45.827
Who's got a person?

1224
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:47.829
Robin Williams on 9/11.

1225
01:09:47.831 --> 01:09:49.697
All right, we've heard
from these guys.

1226
01:09:49.699 --> 01:09:51.932
Let's maybe give somebody else
over here a chance.

1227
01:09:51.934 --> 01:09:54.467
How about a location?
Let's go with a location.

1228
01:09:54.469 --> 01:09:56.602
The offices
of<i> Charlie Hebdo.</i>

1229
01:09:56.604 --> 01:09:59.738
Okay, seriously, sir,
I just need a location.

1230
01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:02.373
- Ferguson, Missouri.
- Germanwings cockpit.

1231
01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:04.308
Okay, I heard "Starbucks."

1232
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:05.742
No, you didn't.
Nobody said Starbucks.

1233
01:10:05.744 --> 01:10:08.945
All right, Starbucks.
Okay, now, who's in the Starbucks?

1234
01:10:08.947 --> 01:10:11.881
- Bill Cosby.
- You people are monsters.

1235
01:10:11.883 --> 01:10:15.123
We're giving you
the tools, buddy. Make some fucking comedy.

1236
01:10:26.429 --> 01:10:28.363
All right.
We'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

1237
01:10:28.365 --> 01:10:30.832
I love you so much, Teddy.

1238
01:10:30.834 --> 01:10:33.968
You go kick some ass, because
I am not taking off this wedding ring.

1239
01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:36.971
I love you too, baby.
I'll see you soon.

Hey, Sam, why do you have a duffel bag
that says Arizona State?

1248
01:11:34.892 --> 01:11:36.558
Because that's
where I went to school.

1249
01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.694
- What, you went to Arizona State?
- Yeah, why?

1250
01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:42.396
Oh, man, that's why we lost the case.
Hello?

1251
01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:44.364
You're dicks.
Arizona State.

1252
01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:46.332
Hey, how many times
you been fucked on a houseboat?

1253
01:11:46.334 --> 01:11:49.668
Come on.

1254
01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:53.104
Did you write your dissertation
on the collected works of Red Bull?

1255
01:11:53.106 --> 01:11:55.439
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
I got an "A" on it.

1256
01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:57.774
So do you say
Arizona State University,

1257
01:11:57.776 --> 01:11:59.675
or do you just say HPVU?

1258
01:12:04.514 --> 01:12:07.082
This is perfect.
We're gonna get to the city before 10:00.

1259
01:12:07.084 --> 01:12:09.384
Hey, Sam,
how's your boring salad?

1260
01:12:09.386 --> 01:12:10.852
It's actually delicious.

1261
01:12:10.854 --> 01:12:12.820
Everybody always says that
about their salad.

1262
01:12:12.822 --> 01:12:14.488
They're all a bunch
of fucking liars.

1263
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:16.523
No, I love it.
It's really good.

1264
01:12:16.525 --> 01:12:18.858
Have some Cookie Crisp.
You need something nutritional.

1265
01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:20.593
Why do you think
I want your Cookie Crisp?

1266
01:12:20.595 --> 01:12:24.964
Hey, what's the deal here?
You guys ever gonna make out or what?

1267
01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:28.367
Teddy, come on, dude!
No, I'm just... I'm just saying.

1268
01:12:28.369 --> 01:12:29.868
You look like you're hitting it off,
you know?

1269
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:31.803
Sam, you dig him, right?

1270
01:12:34.606 --> 01:12:36.940
Hey! Where the hell's my coffee?
I've been waiting for 10 minutes.

1271
01:12:36.942 --> 01:12:39.542
I'm so sorry, sir.
I forgot. I'll get it right away.

1272
01:12:39.544 --> 01:12:42.264
Jesus, you're a waitress,
you're not building rockets. Figure it out.

1273
01:12:42.645 --> 01:12:44.779
What a prick.

1274
01:12:44.781 --> 01:12:47.381
Hey, 20 bucks, I can toss a Cookie Crisp
into his ass crack.

1275
01:12:47.383 --> 01:12:49.149
Wait, let me try.

1276
01:12:49.151 --> 01:12:51.084
I used to pitch for the softball team
at Arizona State.

1277
01:12:51.086 --> 01:12:52.985
Oh, yeah?
Was your mascot a broken condom?

1278
01:12:52.987 --> 01:12:54.519
Shut up.

1279
01:12:56.989 --> 01:12:59.122
Who did that?

1280
01:12:59.124 --> 01:13:01.991
Jesus Christ.
You got to be kidding me!

1281
01:13:01.993 --> 01:13:03.926
Now we're assholes.
Look what you did.

1282
01:13:03.928 --> 01:13:06.929
I swear to God,
I'll kick your goddamn ass!
Who was it?

1283
01:13:06.931 --> 01:13:12.467
Sir, I apologize for my five-year-old son.
I'm "sowwy." Sowwy, sir.

1284
01:13:12.469 --> 01:13:14.869
Cookie Crisp in your bum-bumzies.
I'm sowwy.

1285
01:13:14.871 --> 01:13:19.173
Under the circumstances,
I guess it's okay.

1286
01:13:19.175 --> 01:13:21.475
Oh, my God.
Now we're even bigger assholes.

1287
01:13:21.477 --> 01:13:23.009
Go get my Cookie Crisp
out of his ass.

1288
01:13:23.011 --> 01:13:24.710
You guys making trouble
over here?

1289
01:13:24.712 --> 01:13:26.611
No, ma'am.
We're just minding our business.

1290
01:13:26.613 --> 01:13:28.946
Let's try to keep your boyfriend
under control here, yeah?

1291
01:13:28.948 --> 01:13:30.747
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

1292
01:13:31.482 --> 01:13:33.950
Oh. Good.

1293
01:13:33.952 --> 01:13:35.651
We'll just get the check.
Thanks.

1294
01:13:35.653 --> 01:13:37.185
Of course.

1295
01:13:39.755 --> 01:13:41.655
Oh, my God.
John, did you see that?

1296
01:13:41.657 --> 01:13:43.690
She was totally
giving you the fuck-me eyes.

1297
01:13:43.692 --> 01:13:46.426
- No, she wasn't.
- She was giving you the fuck-me eyes.

1298
01:13:46.428 --> 01:13:50.062
- What are the fuck-me eyes?
- Some women just have fuck-me eyes.

1299
01:13:50.264 --> 01:13:52.030
Do I have fuck-me eyes?

1300
01:13:52.032 --> 01:13:54.399
No, you have "Give us the ring,
my precious" eyes.

1301
01:13:54.401 --> 01:13:56.200
We better get going.

1302
01:13:56.202 --> 01:13:58.335
We got two hours of driving left,
and I'm kind of beat.

1303
01:13:58.337 --> 01:14:00.036
We gotta be well-rested
for tomorrow.

1304
01:14:00.038 --> 01:14:02.071
Wait. I'll drive.
You can take a nap.

1305
01:14:02.073 --> 01:14:04.239
- You don't have a license.
- Who cares?

1306
01:14:04.241 --> 01:14:06.741
Johnny lets me drive every once
in a while when he's too hammered.

1307
01:14:06.743 --> 01:14:11.145
I'm a fucking pro! Besides,
I've been kicked around a lot this week.

1308
01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:14.114
I-I just...
I wanna feel useful, you know?

1309
01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:16.816

What the fuck?

1326
01:16:13.052 --> 01:16:16.086
Well, Sam, it's been 20 minutes.
You wanna take over?

1327
01:16:28.431 --> 01:16:30.265
Hey, listen, Sam,
I'm-I'm real sorry.

1328
01:16:30.267 --> 01:16:32.166
That barn just came
out of nowhere.

1329
01:16:32.168 --> 01:16:34.434
No, no, it's my fault.

1330
01:16:34.436 --> 01:16:36.335
I should never have
let you drive.

1331
01:16:36.337 --> 01:16:39.838
Yeah. You were wrong.
You were wrong to do that. Yeah.

1332
01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:44.108
But that and the trial are the
only two things you fucked up, so, uh...

1333
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:46.243
Hey, I can't see shit in there.

1334
01:16:46.245 --> 01:16:48.245
We're gonna have to wait
till tomorrow to get the car out.

1335
01:16:48.247 --> 01:16:51.314
Uh, wait. Are we gonna
spend the night here?

1336
01:16:51.316 --> 01:16:54.876
Yeah, it'll be fine.
We just got to find some firewood.

1337
01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.859
What the hell?

1338
01:17:11.965 --> 01:17:13.966
Holy shit. Hey, Ted!

1339
01:17:15.201 --> 01:17:18.836
You know what this is?
It's Super Lemon Haze.

1340
01:17:18.838 --> 01:17:21.939
It's a really rare strain. It's a cross
between Lemon Skunk and Super Silver Haze.

1341
01:17:21.941 --> 01:17:24.274
It's totally potent.
I've only had it once in my life,

1342
01:17:24.276 --> 01:17:26.809
and it was one of
the best highs I ever had.

1343
01:17:26.811 --> 01:17:29.845
What the hell is a leaf of this stuff
doing out in the middle of a...

1344
01:17:58.105 --> 01:17:59.839
Dear God!

1345
01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:02.007
Dear God in heaven.

1346
01:18:02.009 --> 01:18:04.409
It's so beautiful.

1347
01:18:04.411 --> 01:18:07.178
It's so beautiful.

1348
01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:08.579
No words.

1349
01:18:09.614 --> 01:18:11.948
No words.

1350
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:14.050
They should've sent a poet.

1351
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:24.058
They're moving in herds.

1352
01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:25.959
They do move in herds.

1353
01:18:30.097 --> 01:18:33.065
Please tell me that's not the only bong
you brought on this trip.

1354
01:18:33.067 --> 01:18:36.134
Yeah, Sam. This puts us in kind
of an awkward position here.

1355
01:18:36.136 --> 01:18:38.569
- We wanna get high too.
- I don't have any papers or nothing.

1356
01:18:38.571 --> 01:18:41.531
Is this hilarious?
I got it at a bachelorette party.

1357
01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:44.307
It's so stupid.

1358
01:18:44.309 --> 01:18:46.175
Here, try it.
Uh, no.

1359
01:18:46.177 --> 01:18:49.611
Why? I don't wanna put
a big glass cock in my mouth.

1360
01:18:49.613 --> 01:18:51.379
You think this is big?

1361
01:18:51.381 --> 01:18:54.215
Johnny, you walked
right into that one, pal.

1362
01:18:54.217 --> 01:18:56.050
- This is all I brought.
- How about this?

1363
01:18:56.052 --> 01:18:58.052
I'm gonna go
check out the barn,

1364
01:18:58.054 --> 01:19:00.587
and see if I can find a soda can or
something for us to make a bong.

1365
01:19:00.589 --> 01:19:02.555
Yeah, see if you can make
a non-dick bong.

1366
01:19:02.557 --> 01:19:04.957
Yeah. Hey, you know,
that's the name of the South Korean president.

1367
01:19:04.959 --> 01:19:06.291
Right?

1368
01:19:06.293 --> 01:19:07.925
She gets... You get it.

1369
01:19:07.927 --> 01:19:09.526
- Right? Nah.
- What?

1370
01:19:09.528 --> 01:19:12.095
Okay, I'll be back.

1371
01:19:12.097 --> 01:19:14.063
Sorry.

1372
01:19:14.065 --> 01:19:16.899
No, I...
This is nice.

1373
01:19:16.901 --> 01:19:19.468
You know, I mean I always wanted
my ex-wife to get stoned with me...

1374
01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:22.170
and she never would, so...
Really? Wow.

1375
01:19:22.172 --> 01:19:24.539
That's the cornerstone
of any great marriage.

1376
01:19:24.541 --> 01:19:26.606
I agree.

1377
01:19:30.243 --> 01:19:32.577
So you think this Meighan guy
is gonna help us?

1378
01:19:32.579 --> 01:19:36.647
I mean, honestly,
I don't know. Um...

1379
01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:40.083
But we're going
to the right place.

1380
01:19:40.085 --> 01:19:43.386
Listen, I just really wanna thank
you for all you've done, all you're doing for us.

1381
01:19:43.388 --> 01:19:46.288
I know it's not making you rich.
Please.

1382
01:19:46.290 --> 01:19:49.690
There are more important things
in life than money.

1383
01:19:50.192 --> 01:19:53.694
Look, I don't know
what kind of mojo...

1384
01:19:53.696 --> 01:19:55.662
was in that wish you made
when you were a child,

1385
01:19:55.864 --> 01:19:58.865
but this bear is alive.

1386
01:19:58.867 --> 01:20:03.736
And it seems to me that once
the law devalues one kind of life,

1387
01:20:03.738 --> 01:20:06.338
how soon before
it devalues another?

1388
01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.660
Who gets subjugated
after the bear?

1389
01:20:09.775 --> 01:20:12.910
You're really smart,
you know that?

1390
01:20:12.912 --> 01:20:17.247
How come you don't have a guy?
Dude, have you seen the guys in Boston?

1391
01:20:17.249 --> 01:20:20.516
I'm supposed to date some pale,
blotchy guy with a wife-beater under his Bruins jacket...

1392
01:20:20.518 --> 01:20:23.151
and a shamrock tattoo
on his calf?

1393
01:20:23.153 --> 01:20:24.519
Nope.
Yeah. That's...

1394
01:20:24.521 --> 01:20:26.854
That's so dumb.

1395
01:20:26.856 --> 01:20:28.689
I couldn't find any cans,

1396
01:20:28.691 --> 01:20:31.658
but I got to tell you,
there's some awesome shit in that barn.

1397
01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.794
Take a look at this. I found a
cowboy hat and a rifle and a guitar.

1398
01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:37.716
- Be careful with that, huh?
- No, it's okay. It's not load...

1399
01:20:39.365 --> 01:20:41.445
And my fucking nose came off.

1400
01:20:42.801 --> 01:20:45.302
Geez, I wonder
who this place belongs to.

1401
01:20:45.304 --> 01:20:46.936
Maybe we should find someplace else.

1402
01:20:46.938 --> 01:20:48.938
We're in the middle of nowhere.

1403
01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:51.540
If we get outta here by dawn,
we should be fine, right?

1404
01:20:52.942 --> 01:20:54.943
You play the guitar?

1405
01:20:54.945 --> 01:20:57.945

You got it!

1435
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:36.750
Come on.
Put your legs into it.

1436

- There you go! Nice job!
- Jesus.

1437
01:23:41.448 --> 01:23:43.448
So, listen, I got to ask.

1438
01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:46.050
Was it just kissing last night,
or was there finger stuff?

1439
01:23:59.530 --> 01:24:03.499
How far are we?
I'd say we're about an hour outside the city.

1440
01:24:03.501 --> 01:24:06.802
Fantastic. So I'm one hour away
from being a real person.

1441
01:24:06.804 --> 01:24:10.071
Hey!
Who the fuck are you?

1442
01:24:10.073 --> 01:24:14.408
This is private property!
Get the fuck out of the car!

1443
01:24:14.410 --> 01:24:15.842
Shit! Go, go, go!

1444
01:24:25.385 --> 01:24:26.817
Shit!

1445
01:24:29.453 --> 01:24:32.093
- Oh, God, I'm sorry! So sorry, pot!
- I'm sorry, pot!

1446
01:24:39.828 --> 01:24:42.129
- What are you doing?
- Saving the day!

1447
01:24:48.401 --> 01:24:49.667
There's the road!
That way! Go!

1448
01:24:54.539 --> 01:24:57.300
- You gotta move! They're right on our ass!
- I'm moving!

1449
01:25:02.045 --> 01:25:03.912
What the fuck, man!

1450
01:25:03.914 --> 01:25:05.780
- What?
- Are you hard?

1451
01:25:05.782 --> 01:25:07.648
Yeah!
This shit makes me hard!

1452
01:25:12.686 --> 01:25:15.020
Whoa!

1453
01:25:15.022 --> 01:25:17.662
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my God! Are they okay?

1454
01:25:20.726 --> 01:25:24.046
They're fine. They look happy.
They're waving at us.
They're giving us the thumbs-up.

1455
01:25:30.467 --> 01:25:34.002
Man, we got a lot of pot in this car.
I wish we could smoke it.

1456
01:25:34.004 --> 01:25:36.471
We're gonna smoke it,
but just stuff it under the seat for now.

1457
01:25:36.473 --> 01:25:38.993
- We don't wanna go to jail.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

Yeah, there's no bullshit

1471

Yeah, you always know
who you're dealing with in New York.

Jesus!
Watch where you're going!

1476
01:26:52.734 --> 01:26:55.234
It's a crosswalk, jackass.
We have the right of way. Yeah.

1477

Whoa.

1478
01:26:57.071 --> 01:26:59.137
Hey, what the hell you doing walking
around dressed like<i> Star Wars?</i>

1479
01:26:59.139 --> 01:27:02.540
It's Comic Con, you idiot.
We're going to the Javits Center.

1480
01:27:02.542 --> 01:27:05.209
You're the idiots, 'cause you three
guys would never be walking together.

1481

Yeah, you're his boss,

Yeah, bite me,
Captain Kirk!

1483
01:27:09.714 --> 01:27:11.647
Whoa, whoa.
Hey! That's<i> Star Trek.</i>

1484
01:27:11.649 --> 01:27:14.549
- Yeah, that's two different franchises.
- Sorry, guys. She doesn't know.

1485
01:27:14.551 --> 01:27:16.751
Nah, it's okay.
I'm sorry you have to deal with that.

1486
01:27:17.619 --> 01:27:18.986
All right, let's go.

1487
01:27:20.188 --> 01:27:22.155
Oh, hey, come on.
It's not worth it, man.

1488
01:27:22.157 --> 01:27:24.237
It's not worth it.
It's not worth it.

1489
01:27:41.906 --> 01:27:44.741
This Patrick Meighan's
got a classy setup, huh?

1490
01:27:44.743 --> 01:27:46.142
Mmm.

1491
01:27:50.514 --> 01:27:53.082
And there is
our first impression.

1492
01:27:53.084 --> 01:27:55.818
Ms. Jackson?
Mr. Meighan will see you now.

1493
01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:57.753
Oh! Okay. Thank you.

1494
01:28:03.259 --> 01:28:06.527
Ah. Ms. Jackson.
Do come in.

1495
01:28:06.529 --> 01:28:08.896
Mr. Meighan,
this is such an honor.

1496
01:28:08.898 --> 01:28:10.998
Thank you so much
for meeting with us.

1497
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.033
Not at all.
It's my pleasure.
Please, sit down.

1498
01:28:13.035 --> 01:28:16.636
- This office is fucking awesome.
- Yeah, totally.

1499
01:28:16.638 --> 01:28:18.804
Hey, hey.
You ever bring chicks up here?

1500
01:28:18.806 --> 01:28:20.906
What do you think?

1501
01:28:20.908 --> 01:28:23.975
I think I wanna sleep
on a bed made of your voice.

1502
01:28:25.243 --> 01:28:27.577
I'll get right down to it.

1503
01:28:27.579 --> 01:28:29.299
I don't want to waste
too much of your time.

1504
01:28:31.248 --> 01:28:33.983
Ted, I've been reviewing
your file.

1505
01:28:33.985 --> 01:28:36.285
And while I'm sympathetic
to your cause,

1506
01:28:36.287 --> 01:28:39.921
I'm sorry to say
I won't be taking your case.

1507
01:28:39.923 --> 01:28:41.822
What? Why?
Why not?

1508
01:28:41.824 --> 01:28:43.824
It comes down to this.

1509
01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:48.961
You want to be human
in the eyes of the law.

1510
01:28:48.963 --> 01:28:51.930
That's a hard sell,
even for me.

1511
01:28:51.932 --> 01:28:54.032
See, the important thing
about being human...

1512
01:28:54.034 --> 01:28:57.201
is making a contribution
to society.

1513
01:28:57.203 --> 01:28:59.336
Assisting in the betterment
of your race.

1514
01:28:59.338 --> 01:29:01.338
You've done none of that.

1515
01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:03.573
I've read about your life.

1516
01:29:03.575 --> 01:29:06.976
The drugs, the parties,
the prostitutes, the arrests.

1517
01:29:06.978 --> 01:29:09.078
Mr. Meighan, we've come
a long way to meet you...

1518
01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.080
because you said
that you could help us.

1519
01:29:11.082 --> 01:29:13.882
I said I would consider it.

1520
01:29:13.884 --> 01:29:16.618
And I have.

1521
01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.120
Ted, you're special.

1522
01:29:19.122 --> 01:29:21.755
You could've been
an inspiration to the world.

1523
01:29:21.757 --> 01:29:24.924
Could've been a leader,
a role model.

1524
01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:26.926
Instead you're...

1525
01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:28.594
Justin Bieber.

1526
01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:30.028
Fuck you!

1527
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:31.763
- Hey, Ted, come on.
- I'm sorry.

1528
01:29:31.765 --> 01:29:33.698
He doesn't mean that.
Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

1529
01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:35.332
There's just no indication...

1530
01:29:35.334 --> 01:29:38.101
that you've had any positive effect
on the world around you.

1531
01:29:38.103 --> 01:29:40.870
That's not true.
He's had a positive effect on me.

1532
01:29:40.872 --> 01:29:43.772
Would that positive effect
be your joint arrest...

1533
01:29:43.774 --> 01:29:46.307
for purchasing marijuana
in 2003?

1534
01:29:46.309 --> 01:29:48.976
How the fuck do<i> you</i> prepare
for a Foo Fighters concert?

1535
01:29:51.012 --> 01:29:52.879
You know why you lost this case?

1536
01:29:54.681 --> 01:29:56.815
It can't be argued by reason.

1537
01:29:56.817 --> 01:30:00.118
The precedent it sets
would affect the public directly.

1538
01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:03.621
And unfortunately,
the public doesn't judge by reason.

1539
01:30:03.623 --> 01:30:05.956
It judges by emotion,

1540
01:30:07.224 --> 01:30:10.226
and you can't appeal
an emotional conviction.

1541
01:30:10.228 --> 01:30:13.895
Nonetheless,
I wish you all the best in your efforts.

1542
01:30:16.298 --> 01:30:19.867
He needs help,
and from what I know about you,

1543
01:30:19.869 --> 01:30:22.349
at one point in your career,
that would've been enough.

1544
01:30:23.237 --> 01:30:27.039
I'm sorry you're not
who I hoped you'd be.

1545
01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:37.460
Are those Tootsie Rolls
just to take?

1546
01:30:39.282 --> 01:30:41.049
Those aren't supposed to be out.

1547
01:30:52.728 --> 01:30:55.129
So that's it.
I'm property.

1548
01:30:55.131 --> 01:30:57.898
No rights, no nothing.

1549
01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:00.867
Ted, dude, I'm so sorry, man.
This completely sucks.

1550
01:31:00.869 --> 01:31:03.102
I feel terrible.

1551
01:31:03.104 --> 01:31:05.270
I let you guys down
all over again.

1552
01:31:05.272 --> 01:31:07.305
Hey.
You didn't let us down, Sam.

1553
01:31:07.307 --> 01:31:09.807
You did your best.

1554
01:31:09.809 --> 01:31:11.675
And, look, regardless
of all this shit,

1555
01:31:11.677 --> 01:31:14.237
you're still the best thing
that's happened to me in a long time.

1556
01:31:20.718 --> 01:31:22.452
Oh... Oh, that's great.
That's fucking great.

1557
01:31:22.454 --> 01:31:23.953
I'm glad you guys are so happy!

1558
01:31:23.955 --> 01:31:25.921
- What?
- What do you mean, "What?"

1559
01:31:25.923 --> 01:31:29.157
I'm totally screwed here, and you're
sitting there basically banging my lawyer,

1560
01:31:29.159 --> 01:31:31.292
and she's probably
still fucking billing us!

1561
01:31:31.294 --> 01:31:33.360
Don't yell at us, dude.
We didn't do anything.

1562
01:31:33.362 --> 01:31:35.328
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

1563
01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:38.264
Maybe if you guys had spent a little
less time mooning over each other...

1564
01:31:38.266 --> 01:31:41.233
Sam could've won this thing,
and I wouldn't be a fucking<i> thing,</i>

1565
01:31:41.235 --> 01:31:43.735
like garbage or a piece of shit.

1566
01:31:43.737 --> 01:31:46.137
We've been fighting right
alongside you the whole way.

1567
01:31:46.139 --> 01:31:48.239
You're the one who's been
pushing me to get back on the horse.

1568
01:31:48.241 --> 01:31:50.341
I finally meet someone,
and you're giving me shit for it?

1569
01:31:50.343 --> 01:31:52.142
Oh, no. You're right.
No, Johnny, it's fine.

1570
01:31:52.144 --> 01:31:53.843
You're right, it's fine.
It's totally fine.

1571
01:31:53.845 --> 01:31:55.978
I got no job, no marriage
and no life!

1572
01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.780
But you have fun porking
Gollum here while I'm left with shit.

1573
01:31:58.782 --> 01:32:00.214
Ted!

1574
01:32:00.216 --> 01:32:02.082
Who's Gollum?
She's a model.

1575
01:32:02.084 --> 01:32:04.818
- Ted, come back.
- Leave me alone!

1576
01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.780
Ted!

1577
01:32:09.822 --> 01:32:11.489
Shit.

1578
01:32:22.066 --> 01:32:24.434
Whoa! Sorry, bro.

1579
01:33:02.005 --> 01:33:03.305
Hey, Ted!

1580
01:33:05.541 --> 01:33:08.009
- Guy?
- I thought that was you. What's happening, man?

1581
01:33:08.011 --> 01:33:09.977
Hey, Rick! It is Ted.

1582
01:33:09.979 --> 01:33:11.511
Hey, how you doing?

1583
01:33:11.513 --> 01:33:13.513
- Hey, what's going on?
- What are you doing here?

1584
01:33:13.515 --> 01:33:16.315
I just feel at home
among the outcasts.

1585
01:33:16.317 --> 01:33:18.083
What are you guys doing here?

1586
01:33:18.085 --> 01:33:21.186
Rick and I,
we just come here as a gag.

1587
01:33:21.188 --> 01:33:24.455
Dress up like we're into this shit
and fuck with the nerds.

1588
01:33:24.457 --> 01:33:27.858
Hey, spaz. Why don't you go
get me some Big League Chew?

1589
01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:30.193
How about that, huh?

1590
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:35.831
Uh-huh. All right.
Well, good luck with your Dick, there.

1591
01:33:35.833 --> 01:33:37.833
Right on.
You too, man.

1592
01:33:37.835 --> 01:33:41.035
Oh, goddamn it!
That underwear had shit on it!

1593
01:33:48.509 --> 01:33:51.511
Yeah, I have a question
for David Hasselhoff. Yes, sir.

1594
01:33:51.513 --> 01:33:55.281
Did you find it difficult as an actor
playing opposite a car?

1595
01:33:55.283 --> 01:33:58.384
You know, that is
a very good question.

1596
01:33:58.386 --> 01:34:03.321
As an actor, you rely on subtle facial
changes and cues from your costars.

1597
01:34:03.323 --> 01:34:05.456
You don't get that with a car.

1598
01:34:05.458 --> 01:34:09.326
But after a while you get used to it.
It becomes the norm.

1599
01:34:09.328 --> 01:34:11.194
Thank you.
Thank you.

1600
01:34:11.196 --> 01:34:13.329
Uh, yeah, excuse me.
I have a question.

1601
01:34:13.331 --> 01:34:17.333
Exactly how many beers did you have
before you got naked with that hamburger?

1602
01:34:17.335 --> 01:34:19.468
You know, buddy,
we all make mistakes.

1603
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:22.404
That was a long time ago
and I'm a different guy now.

1604
01:34:22.406 --> 01:34:24.539
<i>Can I just jump in here
for a second?</i>

1605
01:34:24.541 --> 01:34:27.308
<i>You're a real scumbag
for asking that question.</i>

1606
01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:30.577
- What? It's a fair question.
-<i> No, let me tell you</i>
<i>something about this man...</i>

1607
01:34:30.579 --> 01:34:32.979
KITT, it's all right.
Just let it go.

1608
01:34:32.981 --> 01:34:35.348
<i>No, I want him to hear this.
Let me tell you something.</i>

1609
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:37.416
<i>After the show ended,
I got nothing but shit work.</i>

1610
01:34:37.418 --> 01:34:40.185
<i>I was playing snowplows,
tractors.</i>

1611
01:34:40.187 --> 01:34:43.321
<i>I was even cast as a lawn mower.
That was a real low point.</i>

1612
01:34:43.323 --> 01:34:45.556
<i>And this man
sitting next to me,</i>

1613
01:34:45.558 --> 01:34:49.192
<i>at this very low point in my life,
wrote me a check...</i>

1614
01:34:49.194 --> 01:34:52.128
- Aw, come on, pal.
<i>- No, no, I want everyone to hear this!</i>

1615
01:34:52.130 --> 01:34:54.430
<i>Because you are a good man,
David Hasselhoff.</i>

1616
01:34:54.432 --> 01:34:58.367
<i>You are a good man.
You saved me with your generosity.</i>

1617
01:34:58.369 --> 01:35:00.302
<i>You are the most...</i>

1618
01:35:00.304 --> 01:35:04.039
<i>Oh, God. I'm s... I'm so sorry.
I promised myself I wouldn't get emotional.</i>

1619
01:35:04.041 --> 01:35:06.041
<i>I just love you, buddy.</i>

1620
01:35:06.043 --> 01:35:08.009
<i>I just love you so much.</i>

1621
01:35:08.011 --> 01:35:10.911
<i>I love you so much.
Oh, God.</i>

1622
01:35:10.913 --> 01:35:14.281
I love you too, pal.
I really do. I love you.

1623
01:35:14.283 --> 01:35:17.117
So, like, 25 beers or what?

1624
01:35:17.119 --> 01:35:20.320
<i>- You piece of shit! Get out of here!</i>
- Whoa, man! What the fuck!

1625
01:35:20.322 --> 01:35:22.989
<i>You are not fit to breathe
the same air as this man!</i>

1626
01:35:22.991 --> 01:35:24.890
- KITT, he's not worth it!
- <i>Get out of here!</i>

1627
01:35:24.892 --> 01:35:27.592
What? He's a celebrity.
His personal life is our business.

1628
01:35:27.594 --> 01:35:31.262
<i>Get the fuck out, you piece of dog shit!
I will run you down like roadkill!</i>

1629
01:35:31.264 --> 01:35:35.232
- I don't have to take this shit from a fucking Pontiac.
- <i>Get out! Get the fuck out!</i>

1630
01:35:35.234 --> 01:35:37.167
You're a psycho, dude.
Seriously. You're a psycho.

1631
01:35:37.169 --> 01:35:38.649
- Get some therapy.
- <i>Get out!</i>

1632
01:35:39.436 --> 01:35:41.503
Crazy son of a bitch.

Hey. Are you Ted?

1635
01:35:47.176 --> 01:35:48.942
Uh, yeah.

1636
01:35:48.944 --> 01:35:51.678
This is so exciting!

1637
01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.414
I was such a big fan of yours
in the early '90s.

1638
01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:57.316
Oh. Well, uh, thanks a lot.
What's your name?

1639
01:35:57.318 --> 01:35:59.251
I'm Raphael.

1640
01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:01.152
Hey, do you think I could
take a picture with you?

1641
01:36:01.154 --> 01:36:02.953
Uh, yeah. Yeah, no problem.

1642
01:36:02.955 --> 01:36:04.621
Great, great.
Here, follow me.

1643
01:36:06.457 --> 01:36:09.992
Uh, okay, why are we doing this back here?
You're a celebrity.

1644
01:36:09.994 --> 01:36:12.327
I just don't want you to get mobbed
when people recognize you.

1645
01:36:12.329 --> 01:36:15.396
Yeah, that's true. I've been
mistaken for an Ewok three times today.

1646
01:36:15.398 --> 01:36:17.638
All right, let's do this.

1647
01:36:20.701 --> 01:36:23.169
Holy shit! Donny!

1648
01:36:23.171 --> 01:36:26.238
It's so good to see you, Ted.

1649
01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.006
It's been some time, hasn't it?

1650
01:36:28.008 --> 01:36:30.328
What, you mean since
you ripped me in half?

1651
01:36:31.443 --> 01:36:34.578
That wasn't supposed to happen.
That was an accident.

1652
01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:37.447
I have some big plans
for you, Ted.

1653
01:36:38.148 --> 01:36:39.948
Very big plans.

1654
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:42.150
I need you to come with me now.

1655
01:36:42.152 --> 01:36:44.285

Hey! What the hell?

1658
01:37:12.579 --> 01:37:15.414
He could be anywhere.
We're not gonna find him.

1659
01:37:15.416 --> 01:37:17.115
We should just wait by the car.

1660
01:37:17.117 --> 01:37:18.716
What do you mean?
We have to find him.

1661

Hi. Have any of you guys
seen a talking teddy bear run through here?

1697
01:39:27.785 --> 01:39:29.518
Shh! They're about to announce
the new Superman.

Jonah Hill!

I'm just kidding.
I'm fucking with you.
Come on.

1702
01:39:39.462 --> 01:39:42.262
And if that
is not big enough news,

1703
01:39:42.264 --> 01:39:45.298
Hasbro will be unveiling
a brand-new line...

1704
01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.500

Take a look.

1713
01:40:12.653 --> 01:40:15.287
Come on. There's
an empty supply room downstairs.

1714
01:40:15.289 --> 01:40:19.157
Is that him? Yeah, there was an issue,
so he's unconscious now,

1715
01:40:19.159 --> 01:40:20.658
but yeah, this is him.
Jesus!

1716
01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:22.459
Why did you bring him here?

1717
01:40:22.461 --> 01:40:24.327
I've been following him around
since yesterday.

1718
01:40:24.329 --> 01:40:26.362
This was the only chance
I could get him alone.

1719
01:40:26.364 --> 01:40:28.731
I had to move fast.
Hey, Ted!

1720
01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.767
Is that you?

1721
01:40:31.769 --> 01:40:33.835
Yeah, he had
a little too much to drink.

1722
01:40:33.837 --> 01:40:37.271
He puked a pile of cotton
all over this little girl in a stroller,

1723
01:40:37.273 --> 01:40:39.506
so we're gonna take him back
and sober him up.

1724
01:40:39.508 --> 01:40:41.241
Aw, rock on, Ted.

1725
01:40:41.243 --> 01:40:42.809
Eff, yeah.

1726
01:40:42.811 --> 01:40:46.212
Hey, guys, be careful out there.
Some nerd spilled his lunch.

1727
01:40:46.214 --> 01:40:49.694
Hey, watch that floor.
Comes up fast, man.

1728
01:40:55.554 --> 01:40:57.755
Hey, Johnny.
Guy?

1729
01:40:57.757 --> 01:41:00.424
Man, it's a goddamn party
here today.

1730
01:41:00.426 --> 01:41:02.692
Hey, I remember you
from the wedding.

1731
01:41:02.694 --> 01:41:04.727
You get a nose job?
No.

1732
01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:06.762
Yes, you did, you fuckin' liar.

1733
01:41:06.764 --> 01:41:09.564
- Hey, we just ran into your buddy Ted.
- Ted? Where is he?

1734
01:41:09.566 --> 01:41:12.833
He got a little wasted, so these two
dudes took him out back to sober up.

1735
01:41:12.835 --> 01:41:14.534
- Did you see which way they went?
- Yeah, yeah.

1736
01:41:14.536 --> 01:41:15.935
Back hallway,
past the photo booth.

1737
01:41:15.937 --> 01:41:17.903
Come on!

1738
01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:19.504

Fuckin' love this place.

1740
01:41:31.215 --> 01:41:33.949
What the fuck?
What the fuck's going on here?

1741
01:41:33.951 --> 01:41:37.719
- Who the hell are you?
- He really is extraordinary, isn't he?

1742
01:41:37.721 --> 01:41:40.254
You son of a bitch.
This is kidnapping.

1743
01:41:40.256 --> 01:41:42.422
No, it's not.

1744
01:41:42.424 --> 01:41:44.424
Kidnapping only applies
to people.

1745
01:41:44.426 --> 01:41:46.692
And you, Ted, you're property.

1746
01:41:46.694 --> 01:41:48.694
Yeah, so is
that fucking hairpiece!

1747
01:41:52.365 --> 01:41:53.965
What do you say there?
Happy face.

1748
01:41:53.967 --> 01:41:55.700
- Right there.
- "Death to Ming." Yeah.

1749
01:41:55.702 --> 01:41:57.468
Come on. All right.

1750
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:59.269
Happy guy.

1751
01:41:59.271 --> 01:42:02.751
Right there. "Death to Ming."
Good, yeah.

1752
01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:06.474
Hey, Bennett!

1753
01:42:06.476 --> 01:42:07.908
Oh, shit.

1754
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:11.244
You messed up my car.
What the hell is wrong with you?

1755
01:42:11.246 --> 01:42:13.613
Look, Sam, this is a really bad time, all right?
Something happened to Ted.

1756
01:42:13.615 --> 01:42:17.216
But it was a good time
for you to vandalize my Chrysler though.

1757
01:42:17.218 --> 01:42:18.917
Hey, fuck your Chrysler!

1758
01:42:28.359 --> 01:42:29.992
Holy shit!

1759
01:42:29.994 --> 01:42:31.560
Look, Donny. Donny!
You don't wanna do this.

1760
01:42:31.562 --> 01:42:34.429
Okay? Think about
what happened at Fenway.

1761
01:42:34.431 --> 01:42:36.330
You remember?
You cut me open, that's it.

1762
01:42:36.332 --> 01:42:37.864
I'm gone, dead.

1763
01:42:37.866 --> 01:42:39.699
Just a regular old teddy bear.

1764
01:42:39.701 --> 01:42:41.867
I won't be any fun then,
will I?

1765
01:42:41.869 --> 01:42:43.902
This isn't about you, Ted.

1766
01:42:43.904 --> 01:42:45.970
You're only one bear.

1767
01:42:45.972 --> 01:42:47.805
We're gonna figure out
what makes you real,

1768
01:42:47.807 --> 01:42:49.473
and then we're gonna
make millions of Teds...

1769
01:42:49.475 --> 01:42:51.408
One for every child
in the world.

1770
01:42:52.009 --> 01:42:53.609
One for me.

1771
01:42:55.812 --> 01:42:58.513
One that loves me
just as much as you love John.

1772
01:42:58.515 --> 01:43:01.516
Look, Donny,
I can never love you.

1773
01:43:01.518 --> 01:43:04.352
God, that sounds fucked up.
Listen, I don't wanna die.

1774
01:43:04.354 --> 01:43:07.688
Okay? So what if I gave
you a hand job outside your pants...

1775
01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:09.022
while you ate an ice cream?

1776
01:43:11.759 --> 01:43:13.726
I'll give you a minute.

1777
01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:21.299
Come here!

1778
01:43:54.829 --> 01:43:56.663
Hey, check it out.
Nerd fight.

1779
01:43:56.665 --> 01:43:58.798
Yeah!

1780
01:44:01.901 --> 01:44:03.735
Whoo!

1781
01:44:09.441 --> 01:44:10.774
Come here.

1782
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:14.944
Yeah!

1783
01:44:16.947 --> 01:44:18.547
Come on.

1784
01:44:24.486 --> 01:44:26.653
I'll see you in heaven, Ted.

1785
01:44:33.759 --> 01:44:34.992
Ted!

1786
01:44:34.994 --> 01:44:37.060
Johnny!
Who the hell are you?

1787
01:44:37.062 --> 01:44:39.729
Get away from him,
you bastard!

1788
01:44:39.731 --> 01:44:41.931
- Ted, you okay, buddy?
- Johnny, thank God!

1789
01:44:41.933 --> 01:44:44.400
- I'm out.
- Wait, Mr. Jessup, please don't go.

1790
01:44:44.402 --> 01:44:46.502
- Come on. We can still do this.
- You're on your own, Danny.

1791
01:44:46.504 --> 01:44:48.403
I can't be implicated
in any of this.

1792
01:44:48.405 --> 01:44:51.485
- Wait, wait, wait. Who are you?
- I work for Mattel.

1793
01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:54.574
You piece of shit.

1794
01:44:54.576 --> 01:44:56.609
Killing him at Fenway Park
wasn't enough for you, huh?

1795
01:44:56.611 --> 01:44:58.677
Huh?
What do you wanna do now?

1796
01:44:58.679 --> 01:45:00.912
You don't deserve him, John.
You never did.

1797
01:45:00.914 --> 01:45:02.413
You never did!

1798
01:45:02.415 --> 01:45:04.348
I've been wanting to do this
for a long time.

1799
01:45:05.917 --> 01:45:07.751
Aha! I fucking knew it.

1800
01:45:08.819 --> 01:45:10.085
Come on.

1801
01:45:22.464 --> 01:45:25.365
Listen, Johnny, I wanna
tell you how sorry I am.

1802
01:45:25.367 --> 01:45:26.999
Oh, no, forget it, buddy.

1803
01:45:27.001 --> 01:45:28.934
Look, Teddy, you were upset,
and I shouldn't have brushed it off.

1804
01:45:28.936 --> 01:45:30.568
I'm so sorry.
No, listen to me.

1805
01:45:30.570 --> 01:45:33.037
Just listen to me.
You too, Sam.

1806
01:45:33.039 --> 01:45:35.372
I acted like an asshole.

1807
01:45:35.374 --> 01:45:39.042
All right? I was just hurting
'cause I knew I'd lost.

1808
01:45:39.044 --> 01:45:43.813
And that, in the eyes of the world,
I'll always be property.

1809
01:45:43.815 --> 01:45:46.448
But you know what?
Who gives a shit?

1810
01:45:46.450 --> 01:45:48.483
Right? It doesn't matter
what the world calls me.

1811
01:45:48.485 --> 01:45:50.418
I know who I am.

1812
01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:52.653
And that's all that's important.

1813
01:45:52.655 --> 01:45:54.921
And I know
who my friends are.

1814
01:45:54.923 --> 01:45:56.622
And honest to God,

1815
01:45:56.624 --> 01:46:00.058
if you two wanna be together,
nothing would make me happier.

1816
01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:02.393
Oh, buddy, I love you for that.
Thanks, Ted.

1817
01:46:02.395 --> 01:46:03.894
That means a lot.

1818
01:46:05.796 --> 01:46:08.931
And for what it's worth,
as far as I'm concerned,

1819
01:46:08.933 --> 01:46:10.866
you're a person.

1820
01:46:10.868 --> 01:46:13.735
As much as anybody
I've ever known.

1821
01:46:13.737 --> 01:46:18.406
Aw, Sam, that means the world coming
from someone who went to Arizona State.

1822
01:46:34.722 --> 01:46:35.822
Ted!

1823
01:46:44.896 --> 01:46:46.496
Holy shit! Johnny!

1824
01:46:46.498 --> 01:46:48.698
Oh, my God. John!
Johnny!

1825
01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:50.466
- Aw, Jesus!
- Are you okay?

1826
01:46:50.468 --> 01:46:52.134
- Johnny, you all right?
- Shit.

1827
01:46:52.136 --> 01:46:53.668
John, hey.
Oh, my God.

1828
01:46:53.670 --> 01:46:56.537
- Jesus, what happened here?
- The rocket ship hit him.

1829
01:46:56.539 --> 01:46:58.205
Jesus Christ, that's
the starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

1830
01:46:58.207 --> 01:47:00.473
Forget it.
Somebody call 911!

1831
01:47:00.475 --> 01:47:02.541
Johnny? John, come on.
Stay with me, pal.

1832
01:47:02.543 --> 01:47:04.776
We need an ambulance
at 655 West 34th.

1833
01:47:04.778 --> 01:47:06.811
- How the hell did it fall?
- I don't know!

1834
01:47:10.482 --> 01:47:13.750
It was him!
The guy dressed like the Ninja Turtle!

1835
01:47:17.988 --> 01:47:19.888
- Which one?
- All right.

1836
01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:22.757
Two can play this <i>Where's Waldo?</i> shit,
you son of a bitch.

1837
01:47:22.759 --> 01:47:24.625
Sam, give me your phone.

1838
01:47:33.968 --> 01:47:36.669
<i>♪ I think we're alone now ♪</i>

1839
01:47:36.671 --> 01:47:41.240
<i>♪ There doesn't seem to be
anyone around ♪</i>

1840
01:47:41.242 --> 01:47:44.543
<i>♪ I think we're alone now ♪</i>

1841
01:47:44.545 --> 01:47:46.044
- That's him.
- <i>♪ The beating of our hearts ♪</i>

1842
01:47:46.046 --> 01:47:47.845
<i>♪ Is the only sound ♪♪</i>

1843
01:47:49.514 --> 01:47:52.081
Get off me!
Get off me!

1844
01:47:54.684 --> 01:47:56.985
Johnny?
Johnny, come on.

1845
01:47:58.120 --> 01:47:59.720
Johnny, you gotta wake up, pal.

1846
01:47:59.722 --> 01:48:01.221
Johnny, wake up!

1847
01:48:02.223 --> 01:48:04.591
Wake up, Johnny.

1848
01:48:04.593 --> 01:48:06.125
Johnny...

1849
01:48:06.127 --> 01:48:07.726
Johnny, wake up!

1850
01:48:08.861 --> 01:48:10.561
Johnny, wake up.

1851
01:48:56.103 --> 01:48:58.938
Hi. How is he?
Is he gonna come out of it?

1852
01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:00.806
I don't know, Ms. Jackson.

1853
01:49:00.808 --> 01:49:04.009
We've done everything we can,
and it's all up to him now.

1854
01:49:14.653 --> 01:49:17.721
John, please wake up.

1855
01:49:26.863 --> 01:49:28.663
- Somebody help!
- Oh, my God, John.

1856
01:49:28.665 --> 01:49:30.131
- John? Johnny?
- Hello?

1857
01:49:30.133 --> 01:49:31.866
There's something happening.

1858
01:49:31.868 --> 01:49:33.601
Mr. Bennett?

1859
01:49:33.603 --> 01:49:34.868
- Something's wrong.
- What's happening to him?

1860
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:37.270
- Mr. Bennett?
- John?

1861
01:49:37.272 --> 01:49:39.572
We have a Code Blue in Room 134!

1862
01:49:39.574 --> 01:49:41.740
- What does that mean?
- I'm sorry. You have to wait outside.

1863
01:49:41.742 --> 01:49:43.708
- What the hell's going on?
- The doctors will do everything they can,

1864
01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:45.743
but I need you to go to
the waiting area now, please.

1865
01:49:45.745 --> 01:49:48.178
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What's the status?

1866
01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:50.146
He was stable a minute ago,
and now he's unresponsive.

1867
01:49:50.148 --> 01:49:52.181
The monitor says he's in asystole.
He's not breathing, no pulse.

1868
01:49:52.183 --> 01:49:54.016
Start compressions.
Prepare to intubate.

1869
01:49:54.018 --> 01:49:56.058
Give him a milligram
of epinephrine.

1870
01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.914
I'm sorry. Um...

1871
01:50:27.916 --> 01:50:29.615
He didn't make it.

1872
01:50:31.217 --> 01:50:34.318
What?

1873
01:50:35.787 --> 01:50:37.621
Johnny.

1874
01:50:37.623 --> 01:50:41.391
If you'd like, you can go in
and say your good-byes.

1875
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:22.730
Aw, Johnny.

1876
01:51:25.066 --> 01:51:26.966
You were my thunder buddy.

1877
01:51:29.436 --> 01:51:31.703
You were my thunder buddy
for life.

1878
01:51:34.306 --> 01:51:37.741
And you gave up your own life
to save mine.

1879
01:51:40.177 --> 01:51:42.744
The only problem is,

1880
01:51:45.414 --> 01:51:48.449
I don't know how
my life works without you.

1881
01:51:52.787 --> 01:51:54.254
Good-bye, John.

1882
01:51:57.691 --> 01:52:00.793
I got you, motherfucker!

1883
01:52:00.795 --> 01:52:03.962
Holy shit! He's a zombie!
He's a fucking zombie!

1884
01:52:03.964 --> 01:52:05.430
I totally fucking got you.

1885
01:52:05.432 --> 01:52:07.465
Holy shit!

1886
01:52:07.467 --> 01:52:09.900
You should have
seen your fucking face.

1887
01:52:09.902 --> 01:52:12.869
- You son of a bitch!
- That was fucking classic.

1888
01:52:12.871 --> 01:52:15.104
Wait, wait, wait.
This is payback because I made you think...

1889
01:52:15.106 --> 01:52:17.072
- that I was retarded.
- You made me think you were retarded!

1890
01:52:17.074 --> 01:52:21.242
Oh, well done!
Well done, man.
High five. High five.

1891
01:52:21.244 --> 01:52:23.711
What the fuck is going on?

1892
01:52:23.713 --> 01:52:27.881
What's going on, is this guy
just won the bullshit comedy blue ribbon.

1893
01:52:27.883 --> 01:52:30.283
You are the fucking greatest, man.
Holy shit!

1894
01:52:30.285 --> 01:52:32.752
Wait, wait.
How was the doctor in on it?

1895
01:52:32.754 --> 01:52:34.754
They got me out of it with the paddles.
I was totally fine.

1896
01:52:34.756 --> 01:52:36.222
I talked him into
going along with the bit.

1897
01:52:36.224 --> 01:52:38.157
Hey, Doc, it worked out hilarious.
Thanks.

1898
01:52:38.159 --> 01:52:40.425
No problem.
We're a fun hospital.

1899
01:52:40.427 --> 01:52:44.061
You asshole!
You think this shit is funny?

1900
01:52:44.063 --> 01:52:49.966
I put a frowny face on Facebook.
How am I supposed to explain that to everybody?

1901
01:52:49.968 --> 01:52:54.770
You could change your relationship
status from "single" to "it's complicated."

1902
01:52:54.772 --> 01:52:56.838
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

1903
01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:00.007
How about...

1904
01:53:00.009 --> 01:53:02.109
"In a relationship
with John Bennett"?

1905
01:53:02.111 --> 01:53:06.012
Well, we'll have
to talk about that.

1906
01:53:11.017 --> 01:53:12.450
Okay, well, good talk.

1907
01:53:18.155 --> 01:53:21.157
Hey, if you guys wanna bang,
me and Teddy can totally leave the room.

1908
01:53:21.159 --> 01:53:23.125
No, no, honey, honey.
They're classy.
They're not like us.

1909
01:53:23.127 --> 01:53:25.093
They're good people.

1910
01:53:25.095 --> 01:53:28.296
I'm happy to see everyone
has made a full recovery.

1911
01:53:28.298 --> 01:53:30.398
Mr. Meighan.
What the hell?
Shit!

1912
01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:33.300
- Is it all right if I come in?
- Sure, yeah.

1913
01:53:35.102 --> 01:53:38.471
- How are you feeling, John?
- I'm alive.

1914
01:53:38.473 --> 01:53:42.174
You're very lucky.
I saw what you did on TV.

1915
01:53:42.176 --> 01:53:44.409
Yeah, he saved my ass
is what he did.

1916
01:53:44.411 --> 01:53:47.545
You know why?
Because he's a person.

1917
01:53:47.547 --> 01:53:50.347
And no matter how many of you smart-ass
Harvard lawyers try to keep him down...

1918
01:53:50.349 --> 01:53:53.383
you're not gonna change that...
Not in our eyes.

1919
01:53:53.385 --> 01:53:56.385
Ted is real.
So you can go fuck yourself.

1920
01:53:57.354 --> 01:53:59.355
I will.

1921
01:53:59.357 --> 01:54:02.057
And as soon as I'm done
fucking myself,

1922
01:54:02.059 --> 01:54:04.192
I'd like to take your case, Ted.

1923
01:54:04.194 --> 01:54:05.960
What?
Seriously?

1924
01:54:05.962 --> 01:54:07.261
Oh, my God!
You heard that?

1925
01:54:07.263 --> 01:54:09.363
- Oh, my gosh!
- I don't believe it!

1926
01:54:09.365 --> 01:54:11.932
Maybe we don't want you now.

1927
01:54:11.934 --> 01:54:14.200
- Shut up.
- No, yeah, we want you. For sure, we want you.

1928
01:54:14.202 --> 01:54:16.135
What made you change your mind?

1929
01:54:16.137 --> 01:54:18.403
When I saw
what John did for you...

1930
01:54:18.405 --> 01:54:22.006
That he was willing
to give his life for yours...

1931
01:54:22.008 --> 01:54:24.575
It gave me a kick in the ass.

1932
01:54:24.577 --> 01:54:28.579
Reminded me of why I chose
to do the kind of work I do.

1933
01:54:28.581 --> 01:54:30.981
I'm sorry I turned you away.

1934
01:54:30.983 --> 01:54:32.449
I was wrong.

1935
01:54:32.451 --> 01:54:34.984
As far as I'm concerned,

1936
01:54:34.986 --> 01:54:39.388
anyone who can inspire
that kind of love in another person...

1937
01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:41.189
deserves to be called human.

1938
01:54:41.191 --> 01:54:43.324
Oh, you mean it?

1939
01:54:43.326 --> 01:54:45.826
I certainly do.

1940
01:54:45.828 --> 01:54:48.495
So, shall we get started?

1941
01:54:58.972 --> 01:55:01.406
What defines a person?

1942
01:55:03.308 --> 01:55:05.275
What defines property?

1943
01:55:06.277 --> 01:55:08.077
What's the difference?

1944
01:55:09.846 --> 01:55:14.149
The anthropologist
and ethicist Dawn Prince-Hughes...

1945
01:55:14.151 --> 01:55:16.417
argues that the standards
for personhood...

1946
01:55:16.419 --> 01:55:19.620
include self-awareness,

1947
01:55:19.622 --> 01:55:23.290
an ability to understand
complex emotions...

1948
01:55:23.292 --> 01:55:26.293
and a capacity for empathy.

1949
01:55:27.628 --> 01:55:33.299
We're all in agreement
that Ted is self-aware.

1950
01:55:34.534 --> 01:55:36.468
What is your name?

1951
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:38.470
Ted Clubber Lang.

1952
01:55:43.108 --> 01:55:47.244
As for complex emotions
and the capacity for empathy,

1953
01:55:47.246 --> 01:55:49.546
we all saw
the distressing images...

1954
01:55:49.548 --> 01:55:53.650
of Ted agonizing over his fallen friend,
John Bennett.

1955
01:55:53.652 --> 01:55:56.185
In those images,

1956
01:55:56.187 --> 01:56:01.589
Ted exhibits all of the remaining qualities...
of personhood.

1957
01:56:03.358 --> 01:56:05.625
It's right there
for anyone to see.

1958
01:56:07.227 --> 01:56:11.897
And I believe that a just court must,
by definition,

1959
01:56:11.899 --> 01:56:17.335
grant basic human rights
to all those who deserve them,

1960
01:56:17.337 --> 01:56:20.304
just as
the Emancipation Proclamation...

1961
01:56:20.306 --> 01:56:23.673
and the Thirteenth Amendment did
so many years ago.

1962
01:56:26.476 --> 01:56:28.976
So, ladies and gentlemen
of the court,

1963
01:56:31.145 --> 01:56:33.079
I invite you...

1964
01:56:34.481 --> 01:56:36.448
to change the world.

1965
01:56:56.101 --> 01:56:59.403
Well, Johnny, this is the second time
you've made me real.

1966
01:56:59.405 --> 01:57:01.304
Thanks, pal.

1967
01:57:01.306 --> 01:57:04.540
Hey, you were always real to me,
buddy, even when you weren't.

1968
01:57:04.542 --> 01:57:06.108
Congratulations, Ted.

1969
01:57:06.110 --> 01:57:07.409
Thanks, Sam.

1970
01:57:11.614 --> 01:57:13.774
Ted, over here!
Ted!

1971
01:57:15.317 --> 01:57:17.551
This is quite a victory for you.

1972
01:57:17.553 --> 01:57:19.386
Is there any statement
that you'd like to make,

1973
01:57:19.388 --> 01:57:21.054
now that
you're legally a person?

1974
01:57:21.056 --> 01:57:23.122
Yes, there is.

1975
01:57:25.391 --> 01:57:27.058
Tami-Lynn McCafferty,

1976
01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:28.626
will you marry me?

1977
01:57:30.028 --> 01:57:32.229
Yes.

1978
01:57:37.468 --> 01:57:40.203
<i>And so our story</i>
<i>comes to an end.</i>

1979
01:57:40.205 --> 01:57:43.406
<i>Ted and Tami-Lynn
were married once again,</i>

1980
01:57:43.408 --> 01:57:48.377
<i>and soon afterward,
they adopted a fine, young baby boy.</i>

1981
01:57:48.379 --> 01:57:50.545
Johnny,
meet your new godson,

1982
01:57:50.547 --> 01:57:52.513
Apollo Creed Clubber Lang.

1983
01:57:52.515 --> 01:57:54.681
Teddy, he's adorable.

1984
01:57:54.683 --> 01:57:57.250
Oh, and we got something for him too.
John, show him.

1985
01:57:57.252 --> 01:57:58.985
Oh, shit, yeah.

1986
01:57:58.987 --> 01:58:01.053
- Hold on.
- He got you something.

1987
01:58:01.055 --> 01:58:03.288
Aww!
Huh?

1988
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:04.989
Oh, Johnny!

1989
01:58:04.991 --> 01:58:07.191
Johnny, it's perfect.

1990
01:58:07.193 --> 01:58:11.361
Hey, you know, maybe someday,
if you wish hard enough, maybe he'll come to life,

1991
01:58:11.363 --> 01:58:13.629
and you guys can do
all kinds of drugs together.

1992
01:58:13.631 --> 01:58:15.464
That's all I want for him.

1993
01:58:15.466 --> 01:58:19.201
Oh! It smells like
somebody's got a poopy diaper.

1994
01:58:19.203 --> 01:58:21.203
Teddy, it's your turn
to change him.

1995
01:58:21.205 --> 01:58:22.404
Yeah, no problem.

1996
01:58:23.472 --> 01:58:25.339
Aw, fuck me!

1997
01:58:25.341 --> 01:58:27.240
What's the matter?
That can't be normal.

1998
01:58:27.242 --> 01:58:29.775
He's got to be sick.
He's not sick.
It's just baby doody.

1999
01:58:29.777 --> 01:58:31.443
Yeah, that's
what babies do, Teddy.

2000
01:58:31.445 --> 01:58:33.344
You don't think
this diaper's gross? No.

2001
01:58:33.346 --> 01:58:35.012
All right, here. Catch.

2002
01:58:35.014 --> 01:58:37.714
Teddy, what the fuck?
Holy shit!

2003
01:58:37.716 --> 01:58:40.383
You motherfucker!
