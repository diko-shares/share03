00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:47.598
Evy, I know
what you're thinking,
and the answer is no.

174
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:49.809
We just got home.

175
00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:52.895
That's the beauty of it.
We're already packed.

176
00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:56.649
Why don't you just give me
one good reason?

177
00:21:56.732 --> 00:22:01.403
It's just an oasis, darling.

178
00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:06.742
A beautiful, exciting,

179
00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:09.578
romantic

180
00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:13.582
oasis.

181
00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:18.087
The kind with the white,
sandy beach
and the palm trees

182
00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:21.006
and the cool, clear,
blue water and...

183
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:25.594
We could have
some of those big drinks
with the little umbrellas.

184
00:22:25.803 --> 00:22:27.888
Sounds good.
Sounds too good.

185
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.223
What's the catch?

186
00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:31.600
Supposedly
it's the resting place
of Anubis's army.

187
00:22:31.684 --> 00:22:34.311
See? I knew there's a catch.
There's always a catch.

188
00:22:34.395 --> 00:22:38.858
And let me guess.
It was commanded
by that Scorpion King guy?

189
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:41.193
Yes, but he only awakens
once every 5,000 years.

190
00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:43.028
Right. And if someone
doesn't kill him,

191
00:22:43.112 --> 00:22:45.573
he's gonna wipe out the world.
How did you know?

192
00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:47.658
I didn't.
But that's always the story.

193
00:22:47.741 --> 00:22:49.618
The last known expedition
to actually

194
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.788
reach Ahm Shere
was sent by Ramses IV

195
00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:54.665
over 3,000 years ago.

196
00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:57.459
He sent over a thousand men.
And none of them
was ever seen again.

197
00:22:57.543 --> 00:22:59.587
How did you know?
I didn't.
But that's always the story.

198
00:22:59.628 --> 00:23:02.089
Did I mention
there was a pyramid of gold?
Twice.

199
00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:04.508
Alexander the Great
sent troops in search of it.

200
00:23:04.592 --> 00:23:06.302
Hooray for him.
So did Caesar.

201
00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:08.470
Yeah, look what happened
to his career.
And Napoleon.

202
00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:11.807
But we're smarter than him.
And taller, too.

203
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:15.644
Exactly. That's why
we're gonna find it.
Because we're taller?

204
00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:19.773
That's why I love you.
Nice try.

205

00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:42.046
ALEX: Mom!

207
00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:44.298
What do I do with this chest?

208
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.550
This sucker weighs
a goddang ton.

209
00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:48.719
Alex, watch your language!

210
00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:50.638
Rather weighty, this.

(CLICKING)

212
00:23:56.018 --> 00:23:57.353
Huh?

213
00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:04.193
Evy, that first weird dream
of yours was exactly
six weeks ago, right?

214
00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:07.404
I think so, yes.
But what's that got to do
with anything?

215
00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:11.450
It just happens to coincide
with Egyptian New Year.

216
00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:15.245
Oh. That's right.
What a coincidence.

217
00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:21.168
Maybe. All I'm saying is,
let's be cautious.

218
00:24:25.965 --> 00:24:27.424
Oh!

219
00:24:29.969 --> 00:24:33.639
If anything happened to you,
I would never forgive myself.

00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:56.495
You and Alex
are the only thing
that matter to me.

223
00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:57.997
Well,

224
00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:02.751
the Bembridge scholars
have been begging me

225
00:25:02.793 --> 00:25:04.837
to run the British Museum.

226
00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:15.514
Wh... Whoa.

227
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.107
Cripes, how do you
get this thing off?

228
00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:27.192
Have I kissed you today?

229
00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:38.704
I hate it when you do that.

230
00:25:38.787 --> 00:25:41.749
Why?
Makes me feel like
agreeing to anything.

231
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.250
Anything?

232
00:25:49.465 --> 00:25:51.633
Those knickers
are not mine.

233
00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:54.636
Jonathan.

234
00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:57.264
Hey, Alex,
behave yourself
for five minutes.

235
00:25:57.848 --> 00:25:59.266
You betcha.

236
00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:11.028
Happy to be home?
Couldn't be happier.

237
00:26:11.862 --> 00:26:14.239
It's the year of the scorpion.

238
00:26:14.323 --> 00:26:16.492
Neat!
Thought you might like that.

239
00:26:17.034 --> 00:26:20.662
So then I killed the mummy
and all his minions
and stole his scepter.

240
00:26:20.704 --> 00:26:24.625
Oh, you're so brave.
And rich.
Did I mention rich?

241
00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:26.794
What do you think
I'm doing here?

242
00:26:29.338 --> 00:26:31.173
Sorry. We must be
in the wrong house.

243
00:26:31.215 --> 00:26:33.926
You said
this was your house.
No, I didn't.

244
00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:35.677
Call me!

245
00:26:36.637 --> 00:26:39.139
You're not Sheila's husband,
are you?
No.

246
00:26:39.515 --> 00:26:42.684
Look, if you work for Johnny,
I was gonna pay him back
on Tuesday.

247
00:26:42.768 --> 00:26:44.853
I don't know any Johnny.

248
00:26:44.895 --> 00:26:47.231
We are looking
for the bracelet of Anubis.

249
00:26:47.314 --> 00:26:50.692
Oh, good for you.
Good thing to have,
the old bracelet of Anubis.

250
00:26:50.734 --> 00:26:52.319
Where is it?

251
00:26:52.361 --> 00:26:54.947
You're looking here
for the bracelet. I see.

252
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.032
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

253
00:26:57.074 --> 00:27:00.244
Mr. O'Connell,
you try my patience.

254
00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:03.539
Mr. O'Connell?
No, hold on a minute.
You've got the wrong...

255
00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:05.833
That bracelet.
Now I remember.

256
00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:09.545
I lost it in a card game.
For your sake, I hope not.

257
00:27:13.507 --> 00:27:15.008
It can't be.

258
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:17.719
ANCK-SU-NAMUN: Hello.

259
00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:22.266
Hello.

260
00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:26.728
Where's your wife?
My wife? Oh, you mean Evy.

261
00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:30.357
I think she went off
to Baden-Baden
or Tibet or something.

262
00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:31.900
The girl's a free spirit.

263
00:27:31.942 --> 00:27:34.278
Did I mention
I was single now?

265
00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:42.953
Egyptian asps
are quite poisonous.

266
00:27:43.954 --> 00:27:45.455
It's downstairs.
There's a safe.

267
00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:50.085
The combination is 320-58...

268
00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:52.296
393-something.

269
00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:55.591
It's in a safe downstairs.
I told you. I told you!

270
00:27:55.674 --> 00:27:56.884
And your point is?

271
00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:59.219
My point is,
I told you so you
wouldn't kill me.

272
00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:01.763
When did we make
that arrangement?

273
00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:10.439
Hello.

274
00:28:12.274 --> 00:28:14.568
Jonathan, I thought I said
no more wild parties.

275
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.945
Well, when you're popular...

276
00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:20.407
Alex, I'm serious.
If you've lost that key,
you're grounded.

277
00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:23.452
I haven't lost it.
I just can't find it.
There's a difference.

278
00:28:23.493 --> 00:28:26.288
Well, you'd better start
finding it then.

279
00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:28.749
I will, Mom.
There's nothing
to worry about.

280
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.292
Good evening.

281
00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:36.798
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

282
00:28:36.882 --> 00:28:39.551
I'm looking for the chest,
of course.

283
00:28:41.511 --> 00:28:43.222
Give it to me now.

284
00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:48.977
Get out of my house.

285
00:28:49.061 --> 00:28:51.313
Whoa, Mom.
Maybe not the best idea.

286
00:28:51.355 --> 00:28:53.148
Alex, get back there.

287
00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.946
Definitely not
the best idea.

288
00:28:58.987 --> 00:29:00.781
I think it's time to yell
for Dad now.

289
00:29:00.822 --> 00:29:04.451
Now I will kill you
and take it anyway.
ARDETH: I think not.

290
00:29:06.662 --> 00:29:09.623
Ardeth,
what are you doing here?

291
00:29:09.665 --> 00:29:11.708

are best kept for later.

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.633
he probably deserves
whatever you're about
to do to him,

00:29:19.675 --> 00:29:23.762
but this is my house,
I have certain rules about
snakes and dismemberment.

297
00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:28.767

from your father.

get the bracelet!

I haven't done anything
to anybody!

Yeah.

00:32:22.274 --> 00:32:23.733
Yeah? Okay.

00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:31.324
What are you doing here?
No, scratch that.
I don't care.

324
00:32:31.366 --> 00:32:33.285
Who are those guys?
Where are they taking my wife?

325
00:32:33.368 --> 00:32:36.037
My friend, I'm not sure,

326
00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:40.041
but wherever this man is,
your wife will surely be.

327
00:32:41.835 --> 00:32:43.587
Hey, I know him.

328
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.548
He's the curator.
He works at
the British Museum.

329
00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:48.425
Are you sure?
Believe him.

330
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:51.219
He spends more time there
than at home.

331
00:32:53.472 --> 00:32:56.057
You're here,
the bad guys are here,
Evy's been kidnapped.

332
00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:58.059
Let me guess.
Yes, they once again removed

333
00:32:58.143 --> 00:32:59.269
the creature from his grave.

334
00:32:59.352 --> 00:33:00.395
I don't mean
to point fingers,

335
00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:02.731
but isn't it your job
to make sure
that doesn't happen?

336
00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:04.483
That woman who was with him,
she knows things

337
00:33:04.566 --> 00:33:06.401
that no living person
could possibly know.

338
00:33:06.485 --> 00:33:08.695
She knew exactly
where the creature
was buried.

339
00:33:08.737 --> 00:33:11.907
We were hoping she would
lead us to the bracelet.
She obviously did.

340
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.492
And now they have it.

341
00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:15.994
I wouldn't get
too nervous just yet.

342
00:33:18.205 --> 00:33:19.331

Rick, we're trapped!

1039
01:59:03.219 --> 01:59:04.304
IZZY: Hey!

1040
01:59:07.557 --> 01:59:10.435
Izzy!
Come on!
Get your butts moving!

1041
01:59:10.518 --> 01:59:12.729
Hurry up! Hurry up!
I haven't got all day!

1042
01:59:17.150 --> 01:59:18.777
RICK: Go! You're next!

1043
01:59:25.033 --> 01:59:26.034
(GRUNTS)

1044
01:59:26.618 --> 01:59:28.119
RICK: Jonathan! Hold on!

1045
01:59:28.203 --> 01:59:31.331
Pull him up! Pull him up!
Pull up! Pull me up!

1046
01:59:33.792 --> 01:59:37.420
Wait! Wait!
Let me down! Let me down!

1047
01:59:37.462 --> 01:59:40.924
RICK: It's not worth
your life, you idiot!
Yes, it is! Yes, it is!

1048
01:59:43.593 --> 01:59:44.803
Right.

1049
01:59:50.809 --> 01:59:51.976
(YELLING)

1050
01:59:52.102 --> 01:59:54.938
Pull me up! Pull me up!

1051
02:00:09.911 --> 02:00:12.580
Whoo! Whoo!
Okay.

1052
02:00:13.123 --> 02:00:15.625
Yeah! O'Connell.

1053
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:18.211
You almost got me killed!
At least you didn't get shot.

1054
02:00:19.254 --> 02:00:21.715
Izzy! Thank you!

1055
02:00:22.716 --> 02:00:24.092
Thank you!

1056
02:00:24.968 --> 02:00:26.302
Yes!

1057
02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:30.640
O'Connell, who the hell
you been messin' with
this time?

1058
02:00:30.682 --> 02:00:32.475
Huh?
Oh, you know, the usual.

1059
02:00:32.517 --> 02:00:34.728
Mummies, pygmies,

1060
02:00:35.478 --> 02:00:36.771
big bugs.

1061
02:00:46.823 --> 02:00:48.700

1063
02:01:06.009 --> 02:01:08.470
I thought
I almost lost you there.

1064
02:01:09.012 --> 02:01:10.930
For a moment there, you did.

1065
02:01:12.223 --> 02:01:14.642
Would you like to know
what heaven looks like?

1066
02:01:16.102 --> 02:01:17.270
Later.

1067
02:01:21.274 --> 02:01:23.067
BOTH: Oh, please!

1068
02:01:23.401 --> 02:01:25.862
That's half mine,
you know.
What?

1069
02:01:25.945 --> 02:01:28.364
That's half mine.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1070
02:01:28.406 --> 02:01:31.534
What? You took my gold stick!
I know you took my gold stick!

1071
02:01:31.576 --> 02:01:35.789
I swear on the head
of my wife, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1072
02:01:35.872 --> 02:01:37.874
IZZY: You haven't...
You ain't got a wife!

1073
02:01:37.916 --> 02:01:40.460
JONATHAN: I don't have
your gold stick either!
