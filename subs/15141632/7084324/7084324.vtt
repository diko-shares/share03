2
00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:09.979
Marie. Marie. Are you ok?

3
00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:15.379
Tell me again.

4
00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:19.246
My driver will hear.

5
00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.146
Tell me in French.

6
00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.313
If we are ever separated,

7
00:01:33.346 --> 00:01:34.545
no war,

8
00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.579
no injury,

9
00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:40.413
no challenge will be enough,

10
00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:42.112
You see,

11
00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:45.046
I know that you are waiting for
me.

12
00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.379
I will find you,

13
00:01:47.413 --> 00:01:49.413
and I will love you.

14
00:01:51.313 --> 00:01:53.645
Love is stronger than death.

15
00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.012
You believe so?

16
00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:58.479
Oh I know so.

17
00:01:58.512 --> 00:02:00.146
We will miss you.

18
00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.046
We?

19
00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.079
Promise to return to us soon.

20
00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:31.179
Take it slowly, the road is
terrible

21
00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:33.712
and we're not in a hurry.

22
00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:35.545
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.579
It's ok.

24
00:02:50.112 --> 00:02:53.445
Colonel Von Bruckner, there's
something in the road.

25
00:03:20.213 --> 00:03:20.847
Wait here.

26
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.979
No, no, no don't leave me.

27
00:03:38.345 --> 00:03:40.645
Don't shoot, I'm French!

28
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.179
You're the German's whore.

29
00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:45.213
I'm innocent, I'm one of you.

30
00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:53.512
This is no joke.

31
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.279
Look at this!

32
00:04:01.312 --> 00:04:02.746
No, please don't shoot.

33
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.979
What should we do?

34
00:04:30.646 --> 00:04:32.646
Adieu.

35
00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:02.746
Thank God you're safe my love.

36
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.880
I am so sorry you
had to see that.

37
00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:06.979
Please come. We need to hurry.
Please, please come on.

38
00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.479
Come Marie. Let's go. We're in
danger here.

39
00:08:03.312 --> 00:08:05.312
I think that's someone's grave
sir.

40
00:08:12.746 --> 00:08:15.746
American Soldiers. No need to be
afraid.

41
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:27.613
Go ahead and tell him we're on a
very important mission.

42
00:08:27.646 --> 00:08:30.646
We're looking for the grave of a
man called Von Bruckner.

43
00:08:43.278 --> 00:08:45.278
He said there's no Germans
buried here sir.

44
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.613
He said it's war.

45
00:08:47.646 --> 00:08:49.646
Yeah. Caught that.

46
00:08:59.513 --> 00:09:01.513
Somebody's bullshitting.

47
00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:19.480
Come mademoiselle. Walk straight
ahead. All right you got it.

48
00:09:19.513 --> 00:09:25.045
Whoa peanut. Looks like you were
rode hard and put up wet.

49
00:09:27.413 --> 00:09:29.746
Move Kraut-fucker.

50
00:09:54.078 --> 00:09:55.646
What's he saying? Does he have a
fucking problem?

51
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.279
He gets the point sir. Is this
necessary?

52
00:09:58.313 --> 00:10:00.513
God damn right it's necessary.
Corporal?

53
00:10:00.546 --> 00:10:01.646
All clear Top.

54
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.446
Get him the fuck out of here.
Go on get out of here.

55
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.746
There's a shack. Vic.

56
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.646
Go.
Move it Frenchie.

57
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.680
I don't trust it.

58
00:10:23.111 --> 00:10:25.111
Relax and have a seat.

59
00:10:29.145 --> 00:10:33.145
Make yourself comfortable. We
might be here for a while.

60
00:10:41.212 --> 00:10:44.746
We've come too far to go home
empty handed. That's for sure

61
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.446
and I swear to you I will show
no remorse whatsoever

62
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.480
in leaving you in one of these
open graves.

63
00:10:55.313 --> 00:11:00.313
Am I making myself clear Marie?
That's good.

64
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.978
Come on. I'm gonna
help you up now.

65
00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:17.145
You ok? Tell us where Von
Bruckner's grave is.

66
00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:19.213
I can't remember.

67
00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:21.213
You don't know? She don't...

68
00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:22.279
You're the one that told us
there was

69
00:11:22.313 --> 00:11:24.580
fucking gold here Marie.

70
00:11:24.613 --> 00:11:29.145
I can't remember.

71
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:36.613
What if I take her back behind
those trees? Get some answers.

72
00:11:36.646 --> 00:11:38.646
Like you did with that Italian
broad?

73
00:11:40.213 --> 00:11:41.580
Got the job done didn't it?

74
00:11:41.613 --> 00:11:42.646
She would have said anything.

75
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.011
Man what's your problem! Huh?
What is it to you?

76
00:11:45.045 --> 00:11:50.045
God damn it! We ain't no fucking
Nazis! Am I right?

77
00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:54.179
You should fucking know that
better than anyone!

78
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.179
You know what, you're gonna
talk. She's gonna talk to us.

79
00:11:59.213 --> 00:12:01.546
You wanna know why you're gonna
talk to us.

80
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.746
Because we are no longer enemies
Marie.

81
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.279
We're all allies now whether we
like it or not.

82
00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:18.313
The sooner we find the grave,
the sooner we can all go home.

83
00:12:21.146 --> 00:12:25.480
The cemetery's changed.
So many more graves now.

84
00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:31.446
You have a general fucking idea
maybe?

85
00:12:33.146 --> 00:12:35.045
Maybe this?

86
00:12:35.078 --> 00:12:39.078
Right here over the stream?
Right here?

87
00:12:43.146 --> 00:12:47.213
Ok. Looks like we're digging.
Let's find some shovels.

88
00:12:47.246 --> 00:12:49.011
You're with me.

89
00:12:49.045 --> 00:12:50.379
Shovels?

90
00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:53.146
It's a cemetery corporal.

91
00:12:53.179 --> 00:12:56.179
You just know they got shovels
around here somewhere.

92
00:13:01.346 --> 00:13:08.279
They're doctor recommended. I've
been party to some questionable

93
00:13:08.313 --> 00:13:13.446
stuff during this here war of
ours but this here

94
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.446
takes the biscuit. Your people
were going to tar

95
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.112
and feather that girl. She
begged us to help her.

96
00:13:20.146 --> 00:13:22.279
Promised the Major buried
treasure.

97
00:13:22.313 --> 00:13:25.313
He's risking a court marshal if
we get caught.

98
00:13:51.112 --> 00:13:58.112
Here. Like I said we're allies
now Marie. Come on. You need it.

99
00:14:08.213 --> 00:14:11.480
Just remember one thing. I find
out you're fucking with me

100
00:14:11.513 --> 00:14:18.046
I will kill you deader than
dirt.

101
00:14:27.613 --> 00:14:32.546
Thank you for the cigarette.

102
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:39.279
See there you go. You do speak
some English.

103
00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:45.213
So you are African?

104
00:14:45.246 --> 00:14:52.379
African? No sir. I'm from
Harlem. New York City.

105
00:14:52.413 --> 00:14:53.379
New York.

106
00:14:53.413 --> 00:14:55.745
Greatest city in the world baby.

107
00:14:55.779 --> 00:15:01.246
Home of Nat King Cole. Ella
Fitzgerald. Louie Armstrong.

108
00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:05.513
Louie Armstrong. West Town
Blues.

109
00:15:05.546 --> 00:15:09.246
West Town Blues that's right.
Sometimes during this here war

110
00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:13.279
I close my eyes and I swear I
can hear that music

111
00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:19.313
playing in my head. You like
them American cigarettes I see.

112
00:15:38.513 --> 00:15:41.513
Don't get paid enough for this
shit.

113
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.012
Let's have a look Marie.

114
00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:11.012
You ok corporal?

115
00:16:11.046 --> 00:16:13.046
No!

116
00:16:17.379 --> 00:16:22.279
There's a body but there's no
gold.

117
00:16:22.313 --> 00:16:27.745
Well if you keep playing with us
this will not

118
00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:32.313
end nicely for you. Come on.

119
00:16:41.612 --> 00:16:49.480
Right there? Next one boys. We
keep digging. Let's go.

120
00:16:50.612 --> 00:16:52.612
Ah fuck.

121
00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:59.579
You have nothing to worry about.
They're not gonna hurt you.

122
00:16:59.612 --> 00:17:04.112
Just keep your mouth shut and
I'll make sure that you're safe

123
00:17:04.146 --> 00:17:06.046
And believe me when I say I've
never seen

124
00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:10.446
assholes like these guys before.
Major Maitland.

125
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.612
He's good people. He just got
lost somewhere along the way.

126
00:17:14.645 --> 00:17:17.612
But those other two assholes now
I've followed along side

127
00:17:17.645 --> 00:17:21.213
them and I've seen them do
things.

128
00:17:21.246 --> 00:17:24.612
Inexcusable things in the name
of war.

129
00:17:24.645 --> 00:17:28.645
What we doing right here we just
ain't got cause for.

130
00:17:35.712 --> 00:17:38.712
What's down there?

131
00:17:43.379 --> 00:17:47.379
Motherfucker don't make me hurt
you. What's down there?!

132
00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:25.679
We're dead if they find him like
this.

133
00:18:27.046 --> 00:18:28.679
We're dead if they find him like
this.

134
00:18:28.712 --> 00:18:30.479
What? He was your new best
buddy?

135
00:18:30.512 --> 00:18:32.412
Did you have to kill him?!

136
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.146
Didn't have the time to think.

137
00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:36.412
He'd have kicked the shit out of
me!

138
00:18:36.445 --> 00:18:38.112
She's here.

139
00:18:38.146 --> 00:18:39.379
Who?

140
00:18:39.412 --> 00:18:41.346
Your girlfriend.

141
00:18:41.379 --> 00:18:45.213
Your Belle Marie. She finally
came back.

142
00:18:45.246 --> 00:18:47.745
So she survived?

143
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:52.146
She's here because the gold is
here!

144
00:18:52.179 --> 00:18:55.179
She must have brought the gold
here three years ago.

145
00:18:59.246 --> 00:19:00.279
What the fuck are you doing?

146
00:19:00.313 --> 00:19:02.313
Improvising.

147
00:19:04.813 --> 00:19:08.012
If she's really here, then she
needs our help.

148
00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:11.612
Instead of complaining,
try helping me here!

149
00:19:11.645 --> 00:19:13.645
I think I have a plan!

150
00:19:21.279 --> 00:19:24.780
No gold Major. No gold.

151
00:19:24.813 --> 00:19:28.445
I thought that was it.

152
00:19:28.479 --> 00:19:31.213
It was long ago and so dark.

153
00:19:31.246 --> 00:19:34.445
Major, I can go back and get a
metal detector

154
00:19:34.479 --> 00:19:36.112
from the engineers.

155
00:19:36.146 --> 00:19:39.679
And Frenchie is gonna say God
damn it four guys digging up

156
00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:44.112
graves in their graveyard. Hell
no. They're gonna call

157
00:19:44.146 --> 00:19:46.112
all their fucking buddies and be
back here digging up

158
00:19:46.146 --> 00:19:50.112
every God damn grave before your
detector ever gets here.

159
00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:56.680
I am worn God damn threadbare.
You hear me?

160
00:19:56.713 --> 00:20:00.713
I'm trying to see it in my head
like it was that night.

161
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:09.780
She's a liar and a trickster
Major. I don't believe there's

162
00:20:09.813 --> 00:20:13.179
any more gold in this here
cemetery

163
00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:16.213
as in my dirty, rotten kit bag.

164
00:20:31.246 --> 00:20:33.246
I'm sure.

165
00:20:35.579 --> 00:20:37.279
We'll see.

166
00:20:38.345 --> 00:20:40.345
Shit.

167
00:20:44.046 --> 00:20:47.046
Yes sir. No sir.

168
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.378
That's not funny.

169
00:20:49.412 --> 00:20:52.146
Look at this.

170
00:20:52.179 --> 00:20:54.378
These Americans are so big, what
do they eat?

171
00:20:54.412 --> 00:20:59.378
Well, they eat actual food.
That's a good start I guess.

172
00:20:59.412 --> 00:21:01.412
Here, clean yourself up.

173
00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:14.079
You stay here and cover me from
the door.

174
00:21:23.713 --> 00:21:25.713
Take this.

175
00:21:35.412 --> 00:21:38.613
Lie down if the shooting starts.

176
00:21:38.646 --> 00:21:40.713
I hope you know what you're
doing.

177
00:21:40.746 --> 00:21:42.746
No fucking way.

178
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.512
There's no gold in here.

179
00:22:08.546 --> 00:22:13.746
God damn it! Major!
You get it?!

180
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.680
Taking us on a wild goose chase
are you!

181
00:22:15.713 --> 00:22:20.680
Is that what you're
doing?! Bitch!

182
00:22:20.713 --> 00:22:24.278
What the fuck's your boy
doing? Why's he left his post?

183
00:22:24.312 --> 00:22:26.613
I don't know. Maybe he wants to
trade out.

184
00:22:26.646 --> 00:22:29.079
I don't like it.

185
00:22:29.112 --> 00:22:31.212
Corporal, go see what's going
on.

186
00:22:31.245 --> 00:22:33.245
Yes sir.

187
00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:47.112
Vic what're you doing?

188
00:22:55.112 --> 00:22:59.112
Stay down. Stay close.

189
00:23:10.513 --> 00:23:12.513
Cover me Major.

190
00:23:32.513 --> 00:23:34.312
How you doing buddy?

191
00:23:34.345 --> 00:23:36.345
Through and through.

192
00:23:38.613 --> 00:23:40.613
Give me a grenade.

193
00:23:47.412 --> 00:23:49.412
Hold your cover.

194
00:24:08.111 --> 00:24:11.111
No! No! No!

195
00:24:33.178 --> 00:24:37.480
Clear. Fucker just disappeared.

196
00:24:37.513 --> 00:24:39.513
Come on. You go first.

197
00:24:55.312 --> 00:24:57.012
Stay right here.

198
00:24:57.045 --> 00:24:59.045
All clear.

199
00:25:05.145 --> 00:25:10.145
What the fuck is this about?
Look at me.

200
00:25:13.212 --> 00:25:14.746
Were they here waiting for us
Marie?

201
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.446
Were you setting us up for a
fucking setup?

202
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.480
I don't know. I'm not with them.

203
00:25:23.111 --> 00:25:28.278
We're under strict orders not to
get involved with any reprisals

204
00:25:28.312 --> 00:25:34.111
but we made an exception for
you. Help me she said.

205
00:25:34.145 --> 00:25:37.580
Help me and I'll show you where
they hid the gold right?

206
00:25:37.613 --> 00:25:40.613
Help me and I'll make you God
damn rich.

207
00:25:47.446 --> 00:25:51.680
Risk being court marshaled on
your word.

208
00:25:51.713 --> 00:25:53.713
Do you know what that means?

209
00:26:03.813 --> 00:26:07.613
Badger holes all over the
damn place.

210
00:26:07.646 --> 00:26:10.646
Badger? What the fuck is a
badger?

211
00:26:43.813 --> 00:26:52.011
I'm gonna be ok right? I'm gonna
be ok yeah?

212
00:26:52.045 --> 00:26:55.145
100% copacetic brother.

213
00:26:55.178 --> 00:27:02.413
Fuck that redneck boy. You can't
lie worth a shit.

214
00:27:02.446 --> 00:27:03.480
Top.

215
00:27:03.513 --> 00:27:04.780
Chris.

216
00:27:04.813 --> 00:27:08.680
Jerry, don't leave me here.

217
00:27:08.713 --> 00:27:11.111
You have my word. You have my
word.

218
00:27:11.145 --> 00:27:12.045
Promise?

219
00:27:12.078 --> 00:27:14.746
I do.

220
00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.978
Hayseed.

221
00:27:25.246 --> 00:27:27.246
Bye old pal.

222
00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:36.078
What do we do with him?

223
00:27:36.111 --> 00:27:43.111
Makes no difference right now
does it? Let's get to it.

224
00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:01.045
See that bloody mess lying in
the hole right there?

225
00:28:01.078 --> 00:28:10.346
That's our Chris. We all landed
in Sicily. Fought our way up

226
00:28:10.379 --> 00:28:14.379
through Southern France fighting
for y'all.

227
00:28:19.246 --> 00:28:24.011
Chris, he killed a lot of Nazis.

228
00:28:24.045 --> 00:28:27.179
He was God damned
good at it too.

229
00:28:27.213 --> 00:28:30.746
Wasn't the youngest man. Wasn't
the smartest man either but

230
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:41.111
well he was out with me.
There he is lying in that

231
00:28:41.145 --> 00:28:48.746
God damned hole because of you.

232
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:55.379
Not because of me. Because of
your greed.

233
00:28:55.413 --> 00:28:59.580
You didn't kill Nazis for me or
my people.

234
00:28:59.613 --> 00:29:01.513
You killed them because they
were shooting at you and

235
00:29:01.546 --> 00:29:07.313
wearing a different uniform.
You're no heroes.

236
00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:13.146
You're just survivors. The last
man standing.

237
00:29:13.179 --> 00:29:15.546
Call it a day.

238
00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.546
Tired of her shit boss and I'm
done listening to this bitch.

239
00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.613
Come on Jerry. Come on now. Give
yourself a second and think

240
00:29:23.646 --> 00:29:28.045
about this. Two of our good men
died digging for that

241
00:29:28.078 --> 00:29:32.213
God damned gold and one of hers
died defending.

242
00:29:32.246 --> 00:29:38.346
I swear to you my brother there
is gold here but hey you want to

243
00:29:38.379 --> 00:29:42.379
slit her throat and get us home
nice and early then be my guest.

244
00:29:56.613 --> 00:30:02.613
Tie her up Jerry and then we'll
go looking for that tunnel rat.

245
00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.480
Got a present for you my little
French badger.

246
00:30:42.379 --> 00:30:43.646
God damn!

247
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.112
You ok Jerry?

248
00:30:46.146 --> 00:30:50.146
All ok. That was bigger than I
thought it was going to be.

249
00:30:58.513 --> 00:31:00.646
Do you want to die here,
Clement?

250
00:31:00.679 --> 00:31:03.679
In this shit-hole, after all
that you've been through?

251
00:31:08.546 --> 00:31:12.379
The war is finally over.

252
00:31:12.413 --> 00:31:15.712
It's time for you to start
living again.

253
00:31:15.745 --> 00:31:18.480
And you're going to give up?

254
00:31:18.513 --> 00:31:20.513
Suffocated in your own grave?

255
00:31:20.546 --> 00:31:24.046
Shut the fuck up, George! Why
are you speaking?

256
00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:26.146
You're dead.

257
00:31:26.179 --> 00:31:28.379
You're dead and still bugging
me!

258
00:31:28.413 --> 00:31:31.146
You'll be joining me soon
enough, brother.

259
00:31:31.179 --> 00:31:33.446
And for what?

260
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.712
Some woman.

261
00:31:34.745 --> 00:31:39.213
Some woman you fantasize about
who doesn't even remember you?

262
00:31:39.246 --> 00:31:42.046
Empty promises of gold.

263
00:31:42.079 --> 00:31:43.645
She's here, no?

264
00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:46.679
I'm gonna find the Americans and
kill those sons of bitches.

265
00:31:46.712 --> 00:31:47.246
Yes?

266
00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:48.246
Yes!

267
00:31:48.279 --> 00:31:51.580
And Marie? What will you do to
her, my friend?

268
00:31:51.612 --> 00:31:54.346
I love her, she never did
anything wrong.

269
00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:55.480
Stop!

270
00:31:55.513 --> 00:31:56.146
We were the ones who failed her,
leaving the cemetery!

271
00:31:56.179 --> 00:31:59.313
Keep telling yourself that.

272
00:31:59.346 --> 00:32:01.213
Women were always your downfall.

273
00:32:01.246 --> 00:32:07.046
She will get you killed and
betray you again!

274
00:32:07.079 --> 00:32:10.779
I'm getting out of here. And
I'll show you who I am!

275
00:32:10.812 --> 00:32:13.779
What are you waiting for? Go,
now!

276
00:32:13.812 --> 00:32:15.213
I'm going to live.

277
00:32:15.246 --> 00:32:17.246
I'm gonna live for her.

278
00:32:38.413 --> 00:32:44.179
I don't speak no fucking frog.
You understand that?

279
00:32:44.213 --> 00:32:51.779
Can I tell you a poem?
Especially for you Major.

280
00:32:51.812 --> 00:32:54.779
Yeah sure. Why not?

281
00:32:54.812 --> 00:32:59.679
Feet in the gladiolus, he's
sleeping. Smiling like a sick

282
00:32:59.712 --> 00:33:03.213
child would smile he takes a
nap.

283
00:33:03.246 --> 00:33:08.279
Nature rocks him warmly for he's
cold. Fragrances do not

284
00:33:08.313 --> 00:33:13.179
make his nostrils quiver. He
sleeps in the sun.

285
00:33:13.213 --> 00:33:19.213
Hands on his chest. He has two
red holes on his right side.

286
00:33:24.779 --> 00:33:27.012
What the fuck is that supposed
to mean?

287
00:33:27.046 --> 00:33:30.379
Rimbaud wrote it when he was
16-years-old.

288
00:33:30.413 --> 00:33:34.146
It's about a soldier.

289
00:33:34.179 --> 00:33:40.279
You are good Marie. You know
that? And that smile of yours.

290
00:33:40.313 --> 00:33:42.512
I don't think a Nazi had a God
damned chance

291
00:33:42.545 --> 00:33:48.112
against that smile of yours.
Am I right? What was it?

292
00:33:48.146 --> 00:33:58.612
Money? Security maybe? I wonder.
You know that. I wonder. What

293
00:33:58.645 --> 00:34:02.645
they offered you for you to turn
on your own God damned country.

294
00:34:12.046 --> 00:34:15.612
This song is based on a German
children's story.

295
00:34:15.645 --> 00:34:18.179
The Little Mermaid.

296
00:34:21.779 --> 00:34:24.213
It's about immortal who falls in
love with a human

297
00:34:24.246 --> 00:34:28.246
and learns that true love can
have tragic consequences.

298
00:34:52.579 --> 00:34:54.579
It's a fortune.

299
00:35:02.313 --> 00:35:07.780
Money means nothing to me. I
just need you.

300
00:35:07.813 --> 00:35:11.545
You're young and
idealistic. Believe it or not

301
00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:18.412
I was once very much like you.
It's not the gold we need.

302
00:35:18.445 --> 00:35:25.246
It's what it buys us. Freedom,
security, power.

303
00:35:25.279 --> 00:35:30.612
What about the people we've
stolen it from?

304
00:35:30.645 --> 00:35:32.780
I'm sure the chief of the
chancellor in Berlin

305
00:35:32.813 --> 00:35:34.379
is not going to be happy.

306
00:35:34.412 --> 00:35:36.746
No I mean the people it belonged
to before him.

307
00:35:38.246 --> 00:35:46.213
What does it matter? It is ours
now. I stole this for us.

308
00:35:46.246 --> 00:35:55.479
So that when the fighting is
over we can live as befits us.

309
00:35:55.512 --> 00:35:59.512
And what about this? Won't
people know where it's from?

310
00:36:01.612 --> 00:36:05.179
Time passes. Wars end.

311
00:36:05.213 --> 00:36:09.213
We'll wait until it's safe and
then make our escape.

312
00:36:12.713 --> 00:36:18.046
The cemetery was a magnificent
suggestion my love.

313
00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:22.079
Such a prudent place to hide a
treasure.

314
00:36:34.345 --> 00:36:35.412
Doesn't really matter much
anyway.

315
00:36:35.445 --> 00:36:37.213
I'm sure you had your reasons.

316
00:36:37.246 --> 00:36:43.046
But I'll tell this is for sure.
We don't find that fucking gold

317
00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:51.680
by sundown you will never smile
again. You understand that?

318
00:36:51.713 --> 00:36:53.012
Go to hell.

319
00:36:53.046 --> 00:37:01.713
Glad we understand each other.

320
00:37:01.746 --> 00:37:07.046
Bear them away on your snow
white wings to their

321
00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:15.412
immortal place. It's a better
place now boys with the Lord.

322
00:37:35.146 --> 00:37:38.012
This is the nutmeg. Go ahead S2.

323
00:37:38.046 --> 00:37:42.613
Be advised Jayhawk noted company
strength 2nd SS east of

324
00:37:42.646 --> 00:37:47.479
headed due
south via Route 44. Confirm.

325
00:37:47.512 --> 00:37:50.512
Nutmeg confirmed. Thank you S2.

326
00:38:30.479 --> 00:38:34.046
DeGaulle is in Paris.

327
00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:35.545
Leclerc and the 2nd Armored
Division took it

328
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.212
with the help of Eisenhower.

329
00:38:38.245 --> 00:38:40.179
It's a fucking joke.

330
00:38:40.212 --> 00:38:42.445
Russians have chased us
out of Poland, the Allies

331
00:38:42.479 --> 00:38:44.479
have us on the run in Italy...

332
00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:51.046
and we're officially finished
here.

333
00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:54.546
We can't surrender to the
Bolsheviks, they'll execute us

334
00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.345
for our uniforms.

335
00:38:56.378 --> 00:38:59.378
And of course, our blood
tattoos.

336
00:39:03.512 --> 00:39:06.512
Life as we know it is over.

337
00:39:25.445 --> 00:39:28.178
Le Chemin de la Liberte.

338
00:39:28.212 --> 00:39:30.445
There are several secret escape
routes over the central

339
00:39:30.479 --> 00:39:34.245
Pyrenees into Northern Spain.

340
00:39:34.278 --> 00:39:41.780
We'll have safe haven there, and
enough time to decide what to do

341
00:39:41.813 --> 00:39:44.178
Talk to the men.

342
00:39:44.212 --> 00:39:47.713
Those that wish to, may join me.

343
00:39:47.746 --> 00:39:50.580
Those that don't can do as they
please.

344
00:39:50.613 --> 00:39:52.613
Same thing for you.

345
00:39:52.646 --> 00:39:55.646
I am with you, herr Von
Bruckner.

346
00:40:03.513 --> 00:40:07.345
Get firearms and as much
ammunition as we can carry.

347
00:40:07.378 --> 00:40:10.412
We should march in the evening
and through the night.

348
00:40:10.445 --> 00:40:13.445
Tell no one our destination.

349
00:40:17.046 --> 00:40:22.580
I have one place I must visit on
the way.

350
00:40:22.613 --> 00:40:26.245
A fraulein, herr Von Bruckner?

351
00:40:26.278 --> 00:40:28.278
Marie Dujardin, the girl that we
had released

352
00:40:28.312 --> 00:40:30.646
from Ravensbruck prison.

353
00:40:35.046 --> 00:40:39.278
There was a woman once.

354
00:40:39.312 --> 00:40:42.312
Now just another grave.

355
00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:11.378
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck!

356
00:41:24.646 --> 00:41:28.111
You might want to come look at
this.

357
00:41:28.145 --> 00:41:31.312
We got us a heap of trouble.

358
00:41:31.345 --> 00:41:32.713
They're coming down here.

359
00:41:32.746 --> 00:41:33.780
Where are we?

360
00:41:33.813 --> 00:41:36.012
Right there.

361
00:41:38.078 --> 00:41:40.145
That does make this Route 44
Jerry?

362
00:41:40.178 --> 00:41:42.212
Sure does. 100 percent.

363
00:41:42.245 --> 00:41:46.078
That means they'll be coming
down right on top of us here.

364
00:41:46.111 --> 00:41:51.546
Yes sir. Company 2nd SS.

365
00:42:05.813 --> 00:42:07.480
You're on your own from here.

366
00:42:07.513 --> 00:42:10.111
Allied forces are five miles
west.

367
00:42:10.145 --> 00:42:13.145
I'll hold them as long as I can.

368
00:42:19.312 --> 00:42:22.312
Get a move on, do you want to
live forever?

369
00:42:32.513 --> 00:42:41.480
Company the 2nd SS division. Das
Reich. Hitler's elite guard.

370
00:42:41.513 --> 00:42:43.313
They ain't looking to give
themselves up to

371
00:42:43.346 --> 00:42:45.580
two U. S. infantrymen.

372
00:42:45.613 --> 00:42:48.480
Heading south. Launch from the
beach maybe?

373
00:42:48.513 --> 00:42:51.546
There's a chance they just pass
us by.

374
00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:57.780
Hell no Jerry. Hell no they're
coming. I tell you what,

375
00:42:57.813 --> 00:42:59.011
you've been right all long.

376
00:42:59.045 --> 00:43:04.680
She's been fucking with us since
hour one. But I'll tell you

377
00:43:04.713 --> 00:43:08.178
this, my old friend. When it
comes to this particular little

378
00:43:08.212 --> 00:43:13.546
war we've got going on right
here. It ain't over just yet.

379
00:43:16.279 --> 00:43:21.613
I think it's about time you and
I straighten a few things out.

380
00:43:21.646 --> 00:43:23.546
When you told me you knew that
there was German gold

381
00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.680
hidden you were telling the
truth but you weren't being

382
00:43:26.713 --> 00:43:29.346
all together too
honest now were you?

383
00:43:29.379 --> 00:43:30.746
I've told you no lies.

384
00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.746
Oh I know there's gold here or
so help me I would have

385
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.111
cracked your skull and never
looked back.

386
00:43:36.145 --> 00:43:37.580
Sounds like a good plan boss.

387
00:43:37.613 --> 00:43:40.480
But there is gold here Jerry.
There is gold because

388
00:43:40.513 --> 00:43:43.513
her boyfriend put it here.

389
00:43:43.546 --> 00:43:47.480
And he arranged to meet her
and she kept her promise.

390
00:43:47.513 --> 00:43:52.346
Kraut gets the gold and the
girl.

391
00:43:52.379 --> 00:43:56.480
No, no. That ain't gonna happen
Marie. Want to know why?

392
00:43:56.513 --> 00:44:00.011
See your boyfriend. He's still
gotta cross the tracks.

393
00:44:00.045 --> 00:44:03.078
Navigate his way through the
river. Gives us about an hour

394
00:44:03.111 --> 00:44:09.011
or so to play a little game

395
00:44:09.045 --> 00:44:12.045
Sergeant you remember that game
we played in Salerno?

396
00:44:12.078 --> 00:44:14.313
Sure do.

397
00:44:14.346 --> 00:44:17.145
Bring me a cadaver skull.

398
00:44:17.178 --> 00:44:19.178
You got it.

399
00:44:30.313 --> 00:44:33.313
If I were you I'd keep real
still Marie.

400
00:44:35.713 --> 00:44:39.713
Now you're sure there's nothing
else you want to tell us?

401
00:44:47.045 --> 00:44:50.045
Easy, easy, easy.

402
00:45:06.279 --> 00:45:08.613
I ain't the best shot by no
means at all.

403
00:45:08.646 --> 00:45:11.646
Tell if you know where it is.

404
00:45:18.279 --> 00:45:19.346
You want to tell us where that
gold is

405
00:45:19.379 --> 00:45:21.379
maybe we can all go home.

406
00:45:38.078 --> 00:45:39.313
No, no, no, no.

407
00:45:39.346 --> 00:45:44.346
You listen to me. Listen to me.
That little Kraut pistol ain't

408
00:45:44.379 --> 00:45:49.379
worth squat at this distance so
you stay real still.

409
00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:52.413
That's it little lady. Now.

410
00:46:02.179 --> 00:46:05.746
I'm doing my best to remember.
I promise.

411
00:46:05.779 --> 00:46:07.213
Sun's in his eyes.

412
00:46:07.246 --> 00:46:09.580
You sure you got nothing else to
tell us?

413
00:46:09.613 --> 00:46:20.613
Please. Please don't do this.

414
00:46:33.613 --> 00:46:36.446
Bull shit.

415
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.713
Stop! I'll show you where the
fucking grave is!

416
00:46:40.745 --> 00:46:43.313
I'll give you your gold!

417
00:46:43.346 --> 00:46:50.179
Untie me. I'll show you. I'll
take you. Just stop it!

418
00:46:50.213 --> 00:46:54.079
Jerry, you go check
on those Krauts. I'm gonna give

419
00:46:54.112 --> 00:46:56.246
her one more chance and then
we're out of here.

420
00:46:56.279 --> 00:46:58.112
Please. It wasn't like you
think.

421
00:46:58.146 --> 00:47:01.146
You'll understand
when I tell you.

422
00:47:03.413 --> 00:47:07.413
The cemetery was a magnificent
suggestion my love.

423
00:47:20.346 --> 00:47:23.112
There was a plan.

424
00:47:23.146 --> 00:47:27.011
I knew Von Bruckner planned to
be at the cemetery at 10:30.

425
00:47:27.046 --> 00:47:30.712
Punctuality was important to
him. The housekeeper would pass

426
00:47:30.745 --> 00:47:33.546
my note to the resistance to set
up an ambush

427
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.580
to take back the gold.

428
00:47:45.279 --> 00:47:46.413
Wait here. I'll be back.

429
00:47:46.446 --> 00:47:48.446
No, no, no don't leave me.

430
00:47:54.745 --> 00:47:56.646
Look at this!

431
00:47:56.679 --> 00:47:58.645
No.

432
00:48:03.446 --> 00:48:09.480
with you.

433
00:48:09.513 --> 00:48:13.346
I'm part of the resistance.
Where's George?

434
00:48:13.379 --> 00:48:15.379
He's supposed to be here.

435
00:48:35.812 --> 00:48:38.012
Adieu.

436
00:48:54.812 --> 00:48:59.580
Here it is. It hasn't changed a
bit.

437
00:48:59.612 --> 00:49:02.146
I hope you're not
afraid of ghosts.

438
00:49:06.812 --> 00:49:12.012
No Marie. I don't fear the dead.
Only the living.

439
00:49:26.413 --> 00:49:28.413
Here.

440
00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:40.679
My sweet SS officer, they're
already dead.

441
00:49:40.712 --> 00:49:44.279
There's nothing more that can be
done to them.

442
00:49:44.313 --> 00:49:48.313
There's nothing more they can do
to you.

443
00:49:51.712 --> 00:49:57.313
Did you know them? Marie?

444
00:49:57.346 --> 00:50:03.346
No. It'll be safe here. Nobody
comes here anymore.

445
00:50:48.413 --> 00:50:51.246
Marie, are you all right?

446
00:50:51.279 --> 00:51:00.279
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm just
exhausted my love.

447
00:51:06.146 --> 00:51:09.146
I want to feel you inside of me.

448
00:51:49.645 --> 00:51:50.645
I'm sorry.

449
00:51:50.679 --> 00:51:52.679
For what?

450
00:52:59.512 --> 00:53:02.313
The resistance was supposed to
be waiting at the cemetery

451
00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:06.378
but no one was there. So I had
to do it alone.

452
00:53:06.412 --> 00:53:10.179
When I left I was arrested by
the SS. Without Von Bruckner

453
00:53:10.213 --> 00:53:13.445
to protect me they said I had no
right to be there

454
00:53:13.479 --> 00:53:17.479
and threw me in Ravensbruck for
three years.

455
00:53:27.512 --> 00:53:34.780
Ok. Well Marie, not only are you
a French whore but you're

456
00:53:34.813 --> 00:53:40.012
a murderer as well. You're
family must be proud as punch.

457
00:53:46.079 --> 00:53:49.612
The grave belongs to my family.
My mother and father

458
00:53:49.646 --> 00:53:56.612
were tortured and murdered by an
SS officer called Von Bruckner.

459
00:53:56.646 --> 00:54:02.246
They were farmers. They would
never hurt anyone.

460
00:54:02.279 --> 00:54:05.278
They didn't even understand the
war.

461
00:54:06.612 --> 00:54:08.612
Where Marie?

462
00:54:11.179 --> 00:54:13.179
Follow me.

463
00:54:36.146 --> 00:54:41.146
This it? Du-jar-din.

464
00:54:49.646 --> 00:54:50.613
Maybe lift Jerry?

465
00:54:50.646 --> 00:54:58.646
Yep. You wanna try sliding it?

466
00:55:19.278 --> 00:55:23.278
Well bless her pea picking
little heart.

467
00:55:23.312 --> 00:55:27.312
No more digging coal for me. You
weren't lying.

468
00:55:35.112 --> 00:55:41.079
Ok. Let's pack this up and get
the hell out of dodge, Jerry.

469
00:55:41.112 --> 00:55:46.146
She's still lying like an old
legged dog, Top.

470
00:55:46.178 --> 00:55:50.245
There ain't no Kraut in that
grave.

471
00:55:50.278 --> 00:55:53.278
Impossible. I shot him.

472
00:56:22.513 --> 00:56:25.513
Maybe he up and flew away.

473
00:56:25.546 --> 00:56:28.345
No, no, no I swear I lifted him
and

474
00:56:28.378 --> 00:56:30.212
I put him in the grave myself.

475
00:56:30.245 --> 00:56:33.245
Don't matter much anymore Marie
now does it?

476
00:56:39.079 --> 00:56:45.445
We got the gold Jerry. Let's go
home. I think now would be a

477
00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:49.780
good time for you to kill her
and leave her with her parents.

478
00:56:49.813 --> 00:56:52.178
Music to my ears boss.

479
00:56:52.212 --> 00:56:54.212
Nobody fucking move!

480
00:56:58.646 --> 00:57:01.178
Finally, you came back to us.

481
00:57:01.212 --> 00:57:04.713
We've been waiting a long time
for you, Marie.

482
00:57:04.746 --> 00:57:07.746
Grab the bag and bring it here.

483
00:57:11.345 --> 00:57:13.345
You ready Jerry?

484
00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:31.613
You ok sergeant?

485
00:57:31.646 --> 00:57:35.713
Like Old Blue on the porch
chewing a big old catfish.

486
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.312
The ambush was supposed to be
here at the cemetery,

487
00:57:45.345 --> 00:57:46.746
not on the road.

488
00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.680
I waited for you. Look at me!
Look at me!

489
00:57:49.713 --> 00:57:51.513
Three years I waited!

490
00:57:51.546 --> 00:57:53.245
It's not our fault, Marie.

491
00:57:53.278 --> 00:57:55.580
The Maquis were afraid we'd been
compromised,

492
00:57:55.613 --> 00:57:58.546
so they moved the ambush
to highway 44.

493
00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:01.111
We had to follow orders, Marie.

494
00:58:01.145 --> 00:58:03.746
We were ordered to leave here
after the ambush went bad.

495
00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.979
We should have been there for
you.

496
00:58:09.212 --> 00:58:10.646
They tried to kill me.

497
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:13.680
I'm sorry, Marie. I'm sorry...

498
00:58:14.278 --> 00:58:17.345
You're sorry?

499
00:58:17.379 --> 00:58:21.245
I looked for you everyday, asked
after you, tried to find you.

500
00:58:21.278 --> 00:58:24.278
Every day, every day, every day
Marie.

501
00:58:24.413 --> 00:58:28.145
I spent three years in
Ravensbruck jail.

502
00:58:28.178 --> 00:58:30.613
After I got out the
resistance accused me of

503
00:58:30.646 --> 00:58:33.613
being a collaborator. These
soldiers got me away from them.

504
00:58:33.646 --> 00:58:35.111
Let's get this thing done ay.

505
00:58:35.145 --> 00:58:35.713
You got it.

506
00:58:35.746 --> 00:58:37.746
Flank me.

507
00:58:43.078 --> 00:58:45.011
Have you betrayed us to the
Americans?

508
00:58:45.045 --> 00:58:46.580
There was nothing I could do.

509
00:58:46.613 --> 00:58:49.580
I always wondered whose side you
were on.

510
00:58:49.613 --> 00:58:53.178
Even three years ago with your
Kraut officer.

511
00:58:53.212 --> 00:58:56.346
I've made such a mistake.

512
00:58:56.379 --> 00:58:59.178
That was your mistake. Your men
didn't recognize me.

513
00:58:59.212 --> 00:59:01.111
Everything went wrong.

514
00:59:01.145 --> 00:59:03.613
You weren't at your cemetery.

515
00:59:03.646 --> 00:59:07.613
I shot Von Bruckner and hid the
gold.

516
00:59:07.646 --> 00:59:10.646
I did the job you couldn't.

517
00:59:13.446 --> 00:59:16.978
Excuse me, Marie. Please. Excuse
me.

518
00:59:53.546 --> 00:59:55.546
Put it down.

519
00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.346
I was just trying to help you.

520
01:00:02.379 --> 01:00:05.379
Don't look that way from where
I'm standing.

521
01:00:08.178 --> 01:00:11.513
Tell your friend to come on out.
I promise I won't shoot him.

522
01:00:14.346 --> 01:00:17.446
He wants you to come out. He
won't shoot...

523
01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.078
...for the moment.

524
01:00:20.111 --> 01:00:23.245
You're one clever trickster
Marie.

525
01:00:28.379 --> 01:00:30.480
He doesn't believe you.

526
01:00:30.513 --> 01:00:33.045
Tell him we have no beef with
the resistance.

527
01:00:33.078 --> 01:00:35.480
There's more than enough gold to
go around.

528
01:00:35.513 --> 01:00:38.011
They say they just want the
gold.

529
01:00:38.045 --> 01:00:39.011
Jesus Christ.

530
01:00:39.045 --> 01:00:39.746
You good Major?

531
01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.212
Yeah I'll live.

532
01:00:41.246 --> 01:00:42.279
I figure we get that one out of
cover,

533
01:00:42.313 --> 01:00:44.011
kill 'em both and keep moving.

534
01:00:44.045 --> 01:00:48.078
Too late Jerry. SS will be here
in minutes. We have to go

535
01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:50.346
down the same road that there
heading toward.

536
01:00:50.379 --> 01:00:52.145
There's no chance we can leave
without them seeing us.

537
01:00:52.178 --> 01:00:53.379
What you figure?

538
01:00:53.413 --> 01:00:56.145
There ain't that many of them
Jerry. Way I see it is if we

539
01:00:56.178 --> 01:01:00.078
ambush them just right, they
won't stand a chance.

540
01:01:00.111 --> 01:01:02.446
But we need shooters.

541
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.713
What the hell are they talking
about?!

542
01:01:03.746 --> 01:01:06.279
He says the Germans are coming
and if we try

543
01:01:06.313 --> 01:01:08.111
to run away we're dead.

544
01:01:08.145 --> 01:01:13.746
Ok Marie. You tell him we will
let you both live and we will

545
01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.313
give you a piece of the gold

546
01:01:15.346 --> 01:01:17.646
but you gotta help us
kill these Nazis.

547
01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.513
I don't like it but I get it.

548
01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:22.713
He wants you to fight with them.

549
01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:28.213
They want a real
Resistance fighter.

550
01:01:28.246 --> 01:01:30.178
They want a real Resistance
fighter.

551
01:01:30.213 --> 01:01:32.178
I don't understand.

552
01:01:32.213 --> 01:01:34.246
Ok keep him talking Jerry.

553
01:01:34.279 --> 01:01:36.011
You got it.

554
01:01:40.413 --> 01:01:44.111
Come on out my little French
badger. Come on.

555
01:01:44.145 --> 01:01:46.145
You can come out.

556
01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:57.078
So, you in or you out?

557
01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.680
How we looking?

558
01:02:43.513 --> 01:02:46.713
He can see them and they have
lots of guns.

559
01:02:46.746 --> 01:02:53.346
Come on. Let's get ready.

560
01:03:00.313 --> 01:03:02.513
What's he getting excited about?

561
01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:04.279
He thinks it's suicide.

562
01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:09.446
Whoa Marie. You think it's
suicide? Well we figure they're

563
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.146
on their way cross-country to
Spain. Now the fact that they

564
01:03:13.179 --> 01:03:16.580
made a detour here makes us
highly suspicious of the

565
01:03:16.613 --> 01:03:21.379
lovely Marie. That and the fact
that her lover boy's body

566
01:03:21.413 --> 01:03:26.213
just happens to not be where she
says she left it.

567
01:03:26.246 --> 01:03:30.379
I've already told you I don't
know why he isn't there anymore.

568
01:03:30.413 --> 01:03:37.246
Well, paradise awaits. Let's get
to it. Hey Top.

569
01:03:37.279 --> 01:03:42.580
I'd say we got about 15 minutes
max. Give me that glass.

570
01:04:05.313 --> 01:04:09.279
We've got 3 full out. 3 on the
hip. 10 extra grenades and

571
01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:13.745
some composition from Vic's
backpack. What else we got?

572
01:04:13.779 --> 01:04:15.446
That's about it Top.

573
01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.446
It's gonna have to suffice.

574
01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.012
I guess so.

575
01:04:21.046 --> 01:04:30.146
Frenchie. Let's move.

576
01:04:30.179 --> 01:04:32.179
Are you serious?

577
01:04:49.679 --> 01:04:52.379
Not too close my American
friend.

578
01:04:53.346 --> 01:04:56.346
Tricky little badger aren't you?

579
01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:24.246
Did you really shoot that Kraut,
Marie?

580
01:05:24.279 --> 01:05:27.745
I shot him in the head. He went
down. Pretty sure you

581
01:05:27.779 --> 01:05:31.979
can't survive that. He was cold
when I moved him.

582
01:05:37.112 --> 01:05:41.112
Well you can talk the talk but
can you walk the walk?

583
01:05:44.079 --> 01:05:48.079
You said you can shoot. Question
is can you really?

584
01:05:58.046 --> 01:06:02.346
I grew up on a farm. I know
guns.

585
01:06:02.379 --> 01:06:06.346
Ok. You just follow your
instincts Marie

586
01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:09.379
and you'll be just fine.

587
01:06:14.346 --> 01:06:16.346
You think we'll make it.

588
01:06:21.279 --> 01:06:26.379
Well I've always been good at
it. Survival, I mean.

589
01:06:26.413 --> 01:06:30.579
Never really been good at
anything else.

590
01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:36.745
That don't mean much in the real
world. I don't mean much either.

591
01:06:36.779 --> 01:06:42.112
Too poor to paint. Too proud to
whitewash.

592
01:06:42.146 --> 01:06:48.513
See that's why I need the gold
Marie. I need a fresh start.

593
01:06:48.545 --> 01:06:56.712
I need to start over. You're
mocking me.

594
01:06:56.745 --> 01:07:00.612
You think gold pulled from the
teeth of Jews, wedding

595
01:07:00.645 --> 01:07:05.379
rings stolen from their cold
hands, menorahs snatched

596
01:07:05.413 --> 01:07:12.079
from their fireplaces doesn't
come with a price?

597
01:07:12.112 --> 01:07:17.012
Look around you. I didn't hide
the gold for myself.

598
01:07:17.046 --> 01:07:23.046
I hid it because it's cursed.

599
01:07:23.079 --> 01:07:27.679
But I'm an American Marie. We
don't believe in spirits.

600
01:07:27.712 --> 01:07:35.346
We don't believe in no curses.
We believe in gold.

601
01:07:35.379 --> 01:07:39.712
Yeah that's right Marie. In gold
we trust.

602
01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:22.213
All good Top?

603
01:08:22.246 --> 01:08:24.246
Yeah I'm good.

604
01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:39.246
You ok there Frenchie?

605
01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:42.079
When this goes, it will take out
their legs without

606
01:08:42.112 --> 01:08:43.479
destroying your jeep!

607
01:08:43.512 --> 01:08:45.512
That's good.

608
01:08:52.112 --> 01:08:55.246
S1 patch me through to bomber
command.

609
01:09:47.579 --> 01:09:49.713
Thank you.

610
01:09:49.746 --> 01:09:51.746
You're welcome.

611
01:09:55.146 --> 01:09:59.378
We're probably gonna die here.
You know that?

612
01:09:59.412 --> 01:10:03.279
I don't know.

613
01:10:03.313 --> 01:10:06.246
You regret your part in this?

614
01:10:06.279 --> 01:10:08.780
Well I got a whole belly full of
regrets since I signed up

615
01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:11.645
for this war, Miss.

616
01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:19.179
So why did you do it? Why did
you come with him?

617
01:10:19.213 --> 01:10:26.412
Don't rightly know. Maitland,
he's my friend I guess.

618
01:10:26.445 --> 01:10:31.412
We're older than the others.
Army signed us because they

619
01:10:31.445 --> 01:10:37.479
needed mature leaders of men.
Men of character. Seems

620
01:10:37.512 --> 01:10:40.345
like age doesn't define
character quite the way they

621
01:10:40.378 --> 01:10:53.579
figured. Maybe it's like you.
Sometimes life takes the lead

622
01:10:53.612 --> 01:11:01.146
and you've no choice but to
follow. Good luck Marie.

623
01:11:16.378 --> 01:11:21.012
All that work, the unspeakable
sacrifice, all that waiting.

624
01:11:21.046 --> 01:11:26.146
All for her and she didn't even
glance at you.

625
01:11:26.179 --> 01:11:28.213
You really believe the
Americans,

626
01:11:28.245 --> 01:11:29.746
the "ricains,"

627
01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:32.545
are gonna split the gold with
you?

628
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.345
They'll shoot you and bury you
with the Krauts, you moron!

629
01:11:36.378 --> 01:11:38.213
I'm not going to speak to you.

630
01:11:38.245 --> 01:11:40.245
You're dead!

631
01:11:40.278 --> 01:11:43.345
I saw you die! Let me do my
part, asshole.

632
01:11:43.378 --> 01:11:45.545
Don't you fucking dare leave me
here, Clement!

633
01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:48.046
You're gonna die like me if you
don't listen!

634
01:11:48.079 --> 01:11:50.278
Hell is waiting for you and it's
much worse than

635
01:11:50.312 --> 01:11:52.580
you could ever imagine!

636
01:11:52.613 --> 01:11:55.046
SHUT UP, MAN!

637
01:11:55.079 --> 01:11:58.345
SHUT UP, MAN! SHUT THE FUCK UP!

638
01:11:58.378 --> 01:12:00.780
Don't you remember, Clement, I'm
dead?

639
01:12:00.813 --> 01:12:03.545
Why are you talking to a dead
man?

640
01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.580
I am dead.

641
01:16:10.746 --> 01:16:12.646
Viva France!

642
01:18:09.546 --> 01:18:11.413
All this death for nothing.

643
01:18:13.313 --> 01:18:15.246
And you?

644
01:18:15.279 --> 01:18:18.145
You never even managed to tell
her you loved her?

645
01:19:32.513 --> 01:19:39.213
Bad fucking luck. Picked one
that knew how to tangle.

646
01:19:39.246 --> 01:19:40.346
Can you move?

647
01:19:40.379 --> 01:19:44.713
Feels like I was 'et by a wolf
and shit over a cliff.

648
01:19:44.745 --> 01:19:47.112
Oh no you'll be just fine my old
friend.

649
01:19:47.146 --> 01:19:51.713
I've seen lesser men recover
from a lot worse buddy.

650
01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:53.346
Don't give up do you Top?

651
01:19:53.379 --> 01:20:01.045
Never. Never. I may have
something to warm you up

652
01:20:01.079 --> 01:20:05.313
on the inside. When I was alone
I called for backup.

653
01:20:05.346 --> 01:20:09.045
Told them there were some Fritz
around our location and if

654
01:20:09.079 --> 01:20:12.146
we don't call them back with an
all clear you have permission

655
01:20:12.179 --> 01:20:17.011
to bomb the fuck out of this
Goddamned graveyard. Yeah.

656
01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:24.045
You see, we die Jerry, they die.
No one gets the fucking gold.

657
01:20:24.079 --> 01:20:28.246
Let me get that last asshole,
Top.

658
01:20:28.279 --> 01:20:31.046
Can't move my hand. Give me my
shooter.

659
01:20:31.079 --> 01:20:35.379
You got it.

660
01:20:35.413 --> 01:20:39.446
I got it. I got it.

661
01:20:40.646 --> 01:20:45.679
Good. I'll be right back.

662
01:20:45.712 --> 01:20:47.712
Don't be long.

663
01:21:46.213 --> 01:21:53.546
Jerry! God!

664
01:22:00.112 --> 01:22:05.745
Yeah not bad. Not bad at all.
You have succeeded in

665
01:22:05.779 --> 01:22:13.480
killing a broken regiment. Let's
discuss a truce.

666
01:22:13.513 --> 01:22:16.679
Marie always had a thing for a
man in uniform.

667
01:22:16.712 --> 01:22:19.213
No, that's not possible. I shot
him.

668
01:22:19.246 --> 01:22:24.645
A man who will fight for her.
Kill for her. Don't you see?

669
01:22:24.679 --> 01:22:31.279
She's using you. You must
practice extreme caution with

670
01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:36.779
the likes of Marie, Major.
German, French, American

671
01:22:36.812 --> 01:22:42.480
she makes no distinction. What
she wants is simply to achieve

672
01:22:42.513 --> 01:22:48.612
her end. Then she will stab you
in the back or put a bullet

673
01:22:48.645 --> 01:22:58.612
between your eyes. If you're
lucky she'll shoot off-center.

674
01:22:58.645 --> 01:23:01.645
You're luck has run out Von
Bruckner.

675
01:23:09.179 --> 01:23:12.179
It warms my heart to hear your
voice again.

676
01:23:20.213 --> 01:23:24.279
Last time I heard that beautiful
voice,

677
01:23:24.313 --> 01:23:26.579
you shot me in the face

678
01:23:26.612 --> 01:23:28.612
and left me for dead.

679
01:23:31.612 --> 01:23:33.679
I hate to break up this
beautiful reunion but

680
01:23:33.712 --> 01:23:35.545
I'm still here.

681
01:23:35.579 --> 01:23:41.179
You pull that trigger, we both
die. Marie

682
01:23:41.213 --> 01:23:43.712
Look at the monster you have
made of me.

683
01:23:47.645 --> 01:23:51.279
The look on your face is more
painful than your bullet.

684
01:23:51.313 --> 01:23:54.679
There's something you two need
to know. I called in our

685
01:23:54.712 --> 01:24:00.079
location to Air Force control.
See, if they don't hear an all

686
01:24:00.112 --> 01:24:03.213
clear in about 4 minutes from
right now they've got orders

687
01:24:03.246 --> 01:24:07.413
to bomb this graveyard in to
next fucking year. So I say

688
01:24:07.446 --> 01:24:12.745
maybe we put down these guns. We
all get a little piece of

689
01:24:12.779 --> 01:24:17.979
that Goddamned gold. We can go
on our merry little way.

690
01:24:24.346 --> 01:24:28.346
Well... what do you say? We got a
deal?

691
01:24:42.645 --> 01:24:46.645
That's a very wise decision
Colonel.

692
01:24:51.479 --> 01:24:53.479
No more deals.

693
01:25:28.512 --> 01:25:31.512
Marie, we can be together again.

694
01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.780
Sugar 57 this is Hound Dog 3
over.

695
01:25:59.813 --> 01:26:02.012
This is Sugar 57.

696
01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:08.445
Hound Dog 3 responding to
that... Sugar 57, advise. Over.

697
01:26:08.479 --> 01:26:12.213
Roger Hound Dog 3. No cancel
command. Repeat, no

698
01:26:12.246 --> 01:26:16.246
cancel command. Go ahead and
deliver your payload. Over.

699
01:26:19.545 --> 01:26:21.545
I understand, Marie.

700
01:26:27.479 --> 01:26:30.479
We're coming up on that
position.

701
01:27:19.378 --> 01:27:23.378
Hound Dog 3 has delivered
payload.

702
01:27:41.512 --> 01:27:45.512
Good shooting Hound Dog 3. Over.

703
01:29:04.813 --> 01:29:10.012
It is over, my angels. No one
will have it.

704
01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:13.746
It's done.

705
01:30:35.184 --> 01:30:40.184
