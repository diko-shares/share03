00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.345
for our uniforms.

348
00:38:56.378 --> 00:38:59.378
And of course, our blood
tattoos.

349
00:39:03.512 --> 00:39:06.512
Life as we know it is over.

Le Chemin de la Liberte.

351
00:39:28.212 --> 00:39:30.445
There are several secret escape
routes over the central

352
00:39:30.479 --> 00:39:34.245
Pyrenees into Northern Spain.

353
00:39:34.278 --> 00:39:41.780
We'll have safe haven there, and
enough time to decide what to do

354
00:39:41.813 --> 00:39:44.178
Talk to the men.

355
00:39:44.212 --> 00:39:47.713
Those that wish to, may join me.

356
00:39:47.746 --> 00:39:50.580
Those that don't can do as they
please.

357
00:39:50.613 --> 00:39:52.613
Same thing for you.

358
00:39:52.646 --> 00:39:55.646
I am with you, herr Von
Bruckner.

359
00:40:03.513 --> 00:40:07.345
Get firearms and as much
ammunition as we can carry.

360
00:40:07.378 --> 00:40:10.412
We should march in the evening
and through the night.

361
00:40:10.445 --> 00:40:13.445
Tell no one our destination.

362
00:40:17.046 --> 00:40:22.580
I have one place I must visit on
the way.

363
00:40:22.613 --> 00:40:26.245
A fraulein, herr Von Bruckner?

364
00:40:26.278 --> 00:40:28.278
Marie Dujardin, the girl that we
had released

365
00:40:28.312 --> 00:40:30.646
from Ravensbruck prison.

366
00:40:35.046 --> 00:40:39.278
There was a woman once.

367
00:40:39.312 --> 00:40:42.312
Now just another grave.

368
00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:11.378
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

this.

00:41:28.145 --> 00:41:31.312
We got us a heap of trouble.

371
00:41:31.345 --> 00:41:32.713
They're coming down here.

372
00:41:32.746 --> 00:41:33.780
Where are we?

373
00:41:33.813 --> 00:41:36.012
Right there.

374
00:41:38.078 --> 00:41:40.145
That does make this Route 44
Jerry?

375
00:41:40.178 --> 00:41:42.212
Sure does. 100 percent.

376
00:41:42.245 --> 00:41:46.078
That means they'll be coming
down right on top of us here.

377
00:41:46.111 --> 00:41:51.546
Yes sir. Company 2nd SS.

[TENSE MUSIC]

379
00:42:05.813 --> 00:42:07.480
You're on your own from here.

380
00:42:07.513 --> 00:42:10.111
Allied forces are five miles
west.

381
00:42:10.145 --> 00:42:13.145
I'll hold them as long as I can.

382
00:42:19.312 --> 00:42:22.312
Get a move on, do you want to
live forever?

Company the 2nd SS division. Das
Reich. Hitler's elite guard.

themselves up to

Heading south. Launch from the
beach maybe?

387
00:42:48.513 --> 00:42:51.546
There's a chance they just pass
us by.

388
00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:57.780
Hell no Jerry. Hell no they're
coming. I tell you what,

389
00:42:57.813 --> 00:42:59.011
you've been right all long.

390
00:42:59.045 --> 00:43:04.680
She's been fucking with us since
hour one. But I'll tell you

391
00:43:04.713 --> 00:43:08.178
this, my old friend. When it
comes to this particular little

war we've got going on right
here. It ain't over just yet.

393
00:43:16.279 --> 00:43:21.613
I think it's about time you and
I straighten a few things out.

394
00:43:21.646 --> 00:43:23.546
When you told me you knew that
there was German gold

395
00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.680
hidden you were telling the
truth but you weren't being

396
00:43:26.713 --> 00:43:29.346
all together too
honest now were you?

397
00:43:29.379 --> 00:43:30.746
I've told you no lies.

398
00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.746
Oh I know there's gold here or
so help me I would have

399
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.111
cracked your skull and never
looked back.

400
00:43:36.145 --> 00:43:37.580
Sounds like a good plan boss.

401
00:43:37.613 --> 00:43:40.480
But there is gold here Jerry.
There is gold because

402
00:43:40.513 --> 00:43:43.513
her boyfriend put it here.

403
00:43:43.546 --> 00:43:47.480
And he arranged to meet her
and she kept her promise.

404
00:43:47.513 --> 00:43:52.346
Kraut gets the gold and the
girl.

405
00:43:52.379 --> 00:43:56.480
No, no. That ain't gonna happen
Marie. Want to know why?

406

we played in Salerno?

410
00:44:12.078 --> 00:44:14.313
Sure do.

411
00:44:14.346 --> 00:44:17.145
Bring me a cadaver skull.

412
00:44:17.178 --> 00:44:19.178
You got it.

413
00:44:30.313 --> 00:44:33.313
If I were you I'd keep real
still Marie.

414
00:44:35.713 --> 00:44:39.713
Now you're sure there's nothing
else you want to tell us?

415
00:44:47.045 --> 00:44:50.045
Easy, easy, easy.

416
00:45:06.279 --> 00:45:08.613
I ain't the best shot by no
means at all.

417
00:45:08.646 --> 00:45:11.646
Tell if you know where it is.

418
00:45:18.279 --> 00:45:19.346
You want to tell us where that
gold is

419
00:45:19.379 --> 00:45:21.379
maybe we can all go home.

420
00:45:38.078 --> 00:45:39.313
No, no, no, no.

421
00:45:39.346 --> 00:45:44.346
You listen to me. Listen to me.

you stay real still.

tell us?

[SPEAKING FRENCH]
Please. Please don't do this.

428

fucking grave is!

Untie me. I'll show you. I'll
take you. Just stop it!

Jerry, you go check
on those Krauts. I'm gonna give

her one more chance and then
we're out of here.

00:46:56.279 --> 00:46:58.112
Please. It wasn't like you
think.

You'll understand
when I tell you.

00:47:03.413 --> 00:47:07.413
The cemetery was a magnificent
suggestion my love.

437
00:47:20.346 --> 00:47:23.112
There was a plan.

438
00:47:23.146 --> 00:47:27.011
I knew Von Bruckner planned to
be at the cemetery at 10:30.

439
00:47:27.046 --> 00:47:30.712
Punctuality was important to
him. The housekeeper would pass

my note to the resistance to set
up an ambush

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.580
to take back the gold.

442
00:47:45.279 --> 00:47:46.413
Wait here. I'll be back.

443
00:47:46.446 --> 00:47:48.446
No, no, no don't leave me.

00:47:56.679 --> 00:47:58.645

00:48:13.379 --> 00:48:15.379
He's supposed to be here.

Adieu.

Here it is. It hasn't changed a
bit.

I hope you're not
afraid of ghosts.

No Marie. I don't fear the dead.
Only the living.

454

Here.

My sweet SS officer, they're
already dead.

There's nothing more that can be
done to them.

There's nothing more they can do
to you.

458

Did you know them? Marie?

459
00:49:57.346 --> 00:50:03.346
No. It'll be safe here. Nobody
comes here anymore.

00:50:48.413 --> 00:50:51.246
Marie, are you all right?

461
00:50:51.279 --> 00:51:00.279
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm just
exhausted my love.

462
00:51:06.146 --> 00:51:09.146
I want to feel you inside of me.

463
00:51:49.645 --> 00:51:50.645
I'm sorry.

464
00:51:50.679 --> 00:51:52.679
For what?

465
00:52:59.512 --> 00:53:02.313
The resistance was supposed to
be waiting at the cemetery

466
00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:06.378
but no one was there. So I had
to do it alone.

467
00:53:06.412 --> 00:53:10.179
When I left I was arrested by
the SS. Without Von Bruckner

468
00:53:10.213 --> 00:53:13.445
to protect me they said I had no
right to be there

469
00:53:13.479 --> 00:53:17.479
and threw me in Ravensbruck for
three years.

470
00:53:27.512 --> 00:53:34.780
Ok. Well Marie, not only are you
a French whore but you're

471
00:53:34.813 --> 00:53:40.012
a murderer as well. You're
family must be proud as punch.

472
00:53:46.079 --> 00:53:49.612
The grave belongs to my family.
My mother and father

473
00:53:49.646 --> 00:53:56.612
were tortured and murdered by an
SS officer called Von Bruckner.

474
00:53:56.646 --> 00:54:02.246
They were farmers. They would
never hurt anyone.

475
00:54:02.279 --> 00:54:05.278
They didn't even understand the
war.

476
00:54:06.612 --> 00:54:08.612
Where Marie?

477
00:54:11.179 --> 00:54:13.179
Follow me.

478
00:54:36.146 --> 00:54:41.146
This it? Du-jar-din.

479
00:54:49.646 --> 00:54:50.613
Maybe lift Jerry?

480
00:54:50.646 --> 00:54:58.646
Yep. You wanna try sliding it?

481
00:55:19.278 --> 00:55:23.278
Well bless her pea picking
little heart.

482
00:55:23.312 --> 00:55:27.312
No more digging coal for me. You
weren't lying.

483
00:55:35.112 --> 00:55:41.079
Ok. Let's pack this up and get
the hell out of dodge, Jerry.

484
00:55:41.112 --> 00:55:46.146
She's still lying like an old
legged dog, Top.

485
00:55:46.178 --> 00:55:50.245
There ain't no Kraut in that
grave.

486
00:55:50.278 --> 00:55:53.278
Impossible. I shot him.

487
00:56:22.513 --> 00:56:25.513
Maybe he up and flew away.

488
00:56:25.546 --> 00:56:28.345
No, no, no I swear I lifted him
and

489
00:56:28.378 --> 00:56:30.212
I put him in the grave myself.

490
00:56:30.245 --> 00:56:33.245
Don't matter much anymore Marie
now does it?

491
00:56:39.079 --> 00:56:45.445
We got the gold Jerry. Let's go
home. I think now would be a

492
00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:49.780
good time for you to kill her
and leave her with her parents.

493
00:56:49.813 --> 00:56:52.178
Music to my ears boss.

494
00:56:52.212 --> 00:56:54.212
Nobody fucking move!

495
00:56:58.646 --> 00:57:01.178
Finally, you came back to us.

496
00:57:01.212 --> 00:57:04.713
We've been waiting a long time
for you, Marie.

497
00:57:04.746 --> 00:57:07.746
Grab the bag and bring it here.

498
00:57:11.345 --> 00:57:13.345
You ready Jerry?

499
00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:31.613
You ok sergeant?

500
00:57:31.646 --> 00:57:35.713
Like Old Blue on the porch
chewing a big old catfish.

501
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.312
The ambush was supposed to be
here at the cemetery,

502
00:57:45.345 --> 00:57:46.746
not on the road.

503
00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.680
I waited for you. Look at me!
Look at me!

504
00:57:49.713 --> 00:57:51.513
Three years I waited!

505
00:57:51.546 --> 00:57:53.245
It's not our fault, Marie.

506
00:57:53.278 --> 00:57:55.580
The Maquis were afraid we'd been
compromised,

507
00:57:55.613 --> 00:57:58.546
so they moved the ambush
to highway 44.

508
00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:01.111
We had to follow orders, Marie.

509
00:58:01.145 --> 00:58:03.746
We were ordered to leave here
after the ambush went bad.

510
00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.979
We should have been there for
you.

511
00:58:09.212 --> 00:58:10.646
They tried to kill me.

512
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:13.680
I'm sorry, Marie. I'm sorry...

513
00:58:14.278 --> 00:58:17.345
You're sorry?

514
00:58:17.379 --> 00:58:21.245
I looked for you everyday, asked
after you, tried to find you.

515
00:58:21.278 --> 00:58:24.278
Every day, every day, every day
Marie.

516
00:58:24.413 --> 00:58:28.145
I spent three years in
Ravensbruck jail.

517
00:58:28.178 --> 00:58:30.613

01:20:05.346 --> 01:20:09.045
Told them there were some Fritz
around our location and if

691
01:20:09.079 --> 01:20:12.146
we don't call them back with an
all clear you have permission

692
01:20:12.179 --> 01:20:17.011
to bomb the fuck out of this
Goddamned graveyard. Yeah.

693
01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:24.045
You see, we die Jerry, they die.
No one gets the fucking gold.

694
01:20:24.079 --> 01:20:28.246
Let me get that last asshole,
Top.

695
01:20:28.279 --> 01:20:31.046
Can't move my hand. Give me my
shooter.

696
01:20:31.079 --> 01:20:35.379
You got it.

697
01:20:35.413 --> 01:20:39.446
I got it. I got it.

698
01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.613
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

699
01:20:40.646 --> 01:20:45.679
Good. I'll be right back.

700
01:20:45.712 --> 01:20:47.712
Don't be long.

701
01:21:46.213 --> 01:21:53.546
Jerry! God!

702
01:22:00.112 --> 01:22:05.745
Yeah not bad. Not bad at all.
You have succeeded in

703
01:22:05.779 --> 01:22:13.480
killing a broken regiment. Let's
discuss a truce.

704
01:22:13.513 --> 01:22:16.679
Marie always had a thing for a
man in uniform.

705
01:22:16.712 --> 01:22:19.213
No, that's not possible. I shot
him.

706
01:22:19.246 --> 01:22:24.645
A man who will fight for her.
Kill for her. Don't you see?

707
01:22:24.679 --> 01:22:31.279
She's using you. You must
practice extreme caution with

708
01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:36.779
the likes of Marie, Major.
German, French, American

709
01:22:36.812 --> 01:22:42.480
she makes no distinction. What
she wants is simply to achieve

710
01:22:42.513 --> 01:22:48.612
her end. Then she will stab you
in the back or put a bullet

711
01:22:48.645 --> 01:22:58.612
between your eyes. If you're
lucky she'll shoot off-center.

712
01:22:58.645 --> 01:23:01.645
You're luck has run out Von
Bruckner.

713
01:23:09.179 --> 01:23:12.179
It warms my heart to hear your
voice again.

714
01:23:20.213 --> 01:23:24.279
Last time I heard that beautiful
voice,

715
01:23:24.313 --> 01:23:26.579
you shot me in the face

716
01:23:26.612 --> 01:23:28.612
and left me for dead.

717
01:23:31.612 --> 01:23:33.679
I hate to break up this
beautiful reunion but

718
01:23:33.712 --> 01:23:35.545
I'm still here.

719
01:23:35.579 --> 01:23:41.179
You pull that trigger, we both
die. Marie

720
01:23:41.213 --> 01:23:43.712
Look at the monster you have
made of me.

721
01:23:47.645 --> 01:23:51.279
The look on your face is more
painful than your bullet.

722
01:23:51.313 --> 01:23:54.679
There's something you two need
to know. I called in our

723
01:23:54.712 --> 01:24:00.079
location to Air Force control.
See, if they don't hear an all

724
01:24:00.112 --> 01:24:03.213
clear in about 4 minutes from
right now they've got orders

725
01:24:03.246 --> 01:24:07.413
to bomb this graveyard in to
next fucking year. So I say

726
01:24:07.446 --> 01:24:12.745
maybe we put down these guns. We
all get a little piece of

727
01:24:12.779 --> 01:24:17.979
that Goddamned gold. We can go
on our merry little way.

728
01:24:24.346 --> 01:24:28.346
Well... what do you say? We got a
deal?

729
01:24:42.645 --> 01:24:46.645
That's a very wise decision
Colonel.

730
01:24:51.479 --> 01:24:53.479
No more deals.

731
01:25:28.512 --> 01:25:31.512
Marie, we can be together again.

732
01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.780
Sugar 57 this is Hound Dog 3
over.

733
01:25:59.813 --> 01:26:02.012
This is Sugar 57.

734
01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:08.445
Hound Dog 3 responding to
that... Sugar 57, advise. Over.

735
01:26:08.479 --> 01:26:12.213
Roger Hound Dog 3. No cancel
command. Repeat, no

736
01:26:12.246 --> 01:26:16.246
cancel command. Go ahead and
deliver your payload. Over.

737
01:26:19.545 --> 01:26:21.545
I understand, Marie.

738
01:26:27.479 --> 01:26:30.479
We're coming up on that
position.

739
01:27:13.179 --> 01:27:18.179
[BOMBER PLANES APPROACHING]

740
01:27:19.378 --> 01:27:23.378
Hound Dog 3 has delivered
payload.

741
01:27:41.512 --> 01:27:45.512
Good shooting Hound Dog 3. Over.

742
01:29:04.813 --> 01:29:10.012
It is over, my angels. No one
will have it.

743
01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:13.746
It's done.
