1
00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:30.845
God! I love this job! Man!
Can't you go any faster?

2
00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:32.085
Floor this thing!

3
00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:34.645
It's my wife's. I won't go faster.

4
00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:36.125
You're doing 65 now.

5
00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:37.845
65?! Shit!

6
00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.845
Get your foot off the pedal!
You're killing my corn!

7
00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:48.446
We're eastbound on 4th, in pursuit of
a red BMW, driver Caucasian, blonde.

8
00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:51.206
Plate 2-Boy-Adam-Henry-174.

9
00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:56.366
You are westbound on 2nd.
20 William 12 is southbound.

10
00:00:56.686 --> 00:00:59.966
You're heading straight
toward each other.

11
00:01:00.206 --> 00:01:02.366
- Somebody back off.
- Got it.

12
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:05.046
- What'd she say?
- We're about to have an accident.

13
00:01:24.206 --> 00:01:28.207
Go! We'll stick with the red bastard.
You chase the blue.

14
00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:32.167
That's confirmed.
You got red, we'll get blue.

15
00:01:32.407 --> 00:01:36.487
- What's the pursuit?
- 20 William 15 and 20 William 12.

16
00:01:37.087 --> 00:01:39.047
- That's Riggs, Murtaugh.
- And their squad.

17
00:01:39.247 --> 00:01:41.727
- $20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.
- Who's driving?

18
00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:43.527
Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.

19
00:01:43.727 --> 00:01:46.727
I knew nothing about the wagon.
Bet's off.

20
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:48.167
Shut up!

21
00:01:57.527 --> 00:01:58.887
What the hell is that?

22
00:01:59.087 --> 00:02:01.527
What fuckin' language is that?

23
00:02:01.768 --> 00:02:03.008
It's German.

24
00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:04.368
Japanese?

25
00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:07.608
It's a Japanese radio.
Maybe they bought the L.A.P.D.

26
00:02:07.888 --> 00:02:08.928
They own everything.

27
00:02:14.728 --> 00:02:16.128
Shotgun!

28
00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:26.728
Shots are being fired.

29
00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:28.968
Thanks for the scoop.

30
00:02:29.288 --> 00:02:31.768
The bastard shot my wife's windshield.

31
00:02:32.128 --> 00:02:33.448
Entering the pursuit.

32
00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.609
Oh, shit, man! We're splitting up!

33
00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.249
Son-of-a-bitch! Now we're cooking.

34
00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:01.249
Step on it!

35
00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.449
Look out!

36
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.690
See you!

37
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.730
I'd like to see your license
and proof of insurance!

38
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:05.891
We got one. Yours is going up the hill.

39
00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:07.411
So is Riggs, on foot!

40
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.211
Hey, Riggs! Get your slow ass in here!

41
00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:16.211
Get in here, now!

42
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:17.691
Only if I drive.

43
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:19.531
Move over. I'll drive.

44
00:04:19.731 --> 00:04:22.091
No, go around. I'm driving.

45
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:24.331
I'll drive.

46
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:27.411
Did you get a make on that red Beemer?

47
00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:29.691
Not one scratch, you hear?

48
00:04:34.852 --> 00:04:36.492
- You won't make it.
- I will.

49
00:04:36.692 --> 00:04:37.892
There's not enough room!

50
00:04:38.212 --> 00:04:39.852
You're not going to make it!

51
00:04:40.932 --> 00:04:42.932
Look at my side panel!

52
00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:55.772
Goddamn it, you were right.

53
00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:58.212
There wasn't enough room.

54
00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:02.294
He's turning right!

55
00:06:11.614 --> 00:06:12.934
Get out of the way!

56
00:06:28.295 --> 00:06:29.855
This was a new car, Riggs.

57
00:06:30.295 --> 00:06:31.455
Well, it still is.

58
00:06:38.975 --> 00:06:40.135
On three.

59
00:06:40.815 --> 00:06:41.895
One...

60
00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:44.375
...two... three!

61
00:06:45.895 --> 00:06:47.215
Shit!

62
00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:50.735
You forgot to turn your indicator on.

63
00:06:50.975 --> 00:06:53.615
Where the hell is he?
This guy's Mandrake!

64
00:06:53.815 --> 00:06:56.735
Where were you, man?!
Goddamnit!

65
00:06:57.015 --> 00:06:58.455
Me?! Where did he go?!

66
00:06:58.655 --> 00:07:01.336
- He's fucking gone!
- I can see that!

67
00:07:01.576 --> 00:07:04.536
- You're supposed to come on "three".
- I thought you meant, "three" then go!

68
00:07:04.736 --> 00:07:06.536
No! We always go on "three"!

69
00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:09.736
Sometimes we go, "one, two, three,"
then go!

70
00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:12.336
Go check back there!

71
00:07:12.576 --> 00:07:16.576
If you see anybody running out,
just pump the shit out of them.

72
00:07:17.536 --> 00:07:18.936
What was that?

73
00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:23.336
- He crawled into the trunk.
- I got you covered.

74
00:07:29.936 --> 00:07:31.576
Holy Christ!

75
00:07:32.216 --> 00:07:33.696
That's a lot of money.

76
00:07:40.217 --> 00:07:41.857
It's gold!

77
00:07:42.457 --> 00:07:43.617
Gold!

78
00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:45.017
Krugerrands.

79
00:07:45.217 --> 00:07:48.057
It's illegal. You can't import them
into the country.

80
00:07:48.377 --> 00:07:49.497
You're right.

81
00:07:49.737 --> 00:07:53.297
The damage you caused is coming
out of the department's budget.

82
00:07:53.577 --> 00:07:57.537
- Pay it in Krugerrands.
- Don't make jokes, make arrests.

83
00:07:57.817 --> 00:07:59.737
I want an explanation.

84
00:08:00.017 --> 00:08:03.737
- Things got out of hand.
- You said this was a routine bust.

85
00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:08.897
You didn't mention helicopters,
automatic weapons, Krugerrands...

86
00:08:09.257 --> 00:08:11.217
This was bigger than we thought.

87
00:08:11.737 --> 00:08:13.057
Talk to you later.

88
00:08:19.578 --> 00:08:22.578
I worked psycho ward.
You'll never get out.

89
00:08:23.938 --> 00:08:26.258
One minute, fifteen seconds.

90
00:08:26.578 --> 00:08:28.418
Shapiro, scratch my nose.

91
00:08:29.778 --> 00:08:34.378
Hey! What's going on? Is this
kindergarten or a police station?

92
00:08:34.858 --> 00:08:36.258
Get some work done.

93
00:08:36.938 --> 00:08:39.578
Houdini Jr. Bets he can free himself
in 5 minutes.

94
00:08:39.858 --> 00:08:40.858
I will too.

95
00:08:46.098 --> 00:08:48.178
Don't try this at home, kids.

96
00:08:58.139 --> 00:09:02.579
It's over now. Put your money
on the desk and get back to work.

97
00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:06.299
Suckers.

98
00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:14.739
How the hell did you do that?

99
00:09:16.299 --> 00:09:20.099
I dislocated my shoulder once.
Now I can do it whenever I want.

100
00:09:20.299 --> 00:09:21.739
Doesn't it hurt?

101
00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:23.979
Yeah, it does.

102
00:09:24.739 --> 00:09:27.659
But not as much as...
when I put it back in.

103
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.860
If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.

104
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.500
My door is always open, Sergeant.

105
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.340
We should keep this
on a professional level.

106
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.340
Why the hell do you
do this to yourself?

107
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.500
Who else could I do it to?
None of them will let me.

108
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.260
And I need the money.

109
00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.340
Cough up!

110
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.860
It's not all here yet. I want it all.

111
00:10:11.021 --> 00:10:12.981
Where did this come from?

112
00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:18.541
You can't help yourself to this stuff!
It's evidence. It's a Krugerrand.

113
00:10:19.021 --> 00:10:21.461
- It's mine. I won it.
- It's not yours.

114
00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:23.821
You want to get busted?

115
00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:27.541
Want to get something to eat?

116
00:10:27.821 --> 00:10:29.301
Not tonight.

117
00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:31.981
- Rianne's commercial is on.
- She's in a commercial?

118
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:33.861
Not so loud!

119
00:10:34.061 --> 00:10:36.901
What's wrong?
I'd be proud if I was you.

120
00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.901
I haven't seen it yet.
What if she stinks?

121
00:10:41.181 --> 00:10:43.661
You got to be kidding. She'll be great.

122
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:44.982
Listen up!

123
00:10:46.182 --> 00:10:48.222
Tonight at... what time?

124
00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:49.422
Come on!

125
00:10:49.742 --> 00:10:51.062
What time?

126
00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:52.782
Eight.

127
00:10:53.062 --> 00:10:54.662
Eight o'clock, on... channel?

128
00:10:57.182 --> 00:11:01.342
Eight. The Sergeant's daughter, Rianne.
Here's a picture of her.

129
00:11:03.022 --> 00:11:06.182
She's going to make
her television debut in a commercial.

130
00:11:12.702 --> 00:11:15.542
With this crowd, baby,
you'd better not stink.

131
00:11:30.783 --> 00:11:34.263
What happened? This is a new car.
Mom's going to be upset!

132
00:11:34.543 --> 00:11:37.223
- It's still new.
- No, it's not, it's wrecked.

133
00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:39.903
I don't want your mother to know.

134
00:11:41.063 --> 00:11:42.903
Do your homework too.

135
00:11:43.143 --> 00:11:46.023
- Hey! I haven't read these.
- Rianne put them there.

136
00:11:46.223 --> 00:11:48.463
Why don't you look out for me?

137
00:11:48.743 --> 00:11:52.823
Hey, Ricky! I want to use my driveway
once in a while.

138
00:11:53.423 --> 00:11:55.263
Nice oxygen tent.

139
00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:58.903
- Do I look like Michael Jackson?
- No, but you're bad.

140
00:11:59.263 --> 00:12:03.464
This is a two-car garage,
and this is my hobby room upstairs.

141
00:12:03.744 --> 00:12:08.224
I retire when I'm 52, the whole
nine yards kick in when I'm 55.

142
00:12:08.504 --> 00:12:10.304
You're not retiring, are you?

143
00:12:10.584 --> 00:12:13.424
- I've thought of it, since I met you.
- Thank you.

144
00:12:13.744 --> 00:12:17.184
This is a nice hobby room.
All you need now is a hobby.

145
00:12:20.344 --> 00:12:21.104
Jesus!

146
00:12:21.584 --> 00:12:22.944
What's wrong with you?

147
00:12:23.824 --> 00:12:25.704
I'm sorry. That's very uncool.

148
00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:28.184
You're sorry? Check my shorts!

149
00:12:28.944 --> 00:12:31.424
- Don't you use hammers anymore?
- What's a hammer?

150
00:12:33.264 --> 00:12:36.784
Easy. It's no Saturday Night Special,
for crying out loud.

151
00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:40.105
Give it back.

152
00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:44.265
A man's not even safe in his own home.

153
00:12:44.545 --> 00:12:46.105
Then stay the hell out of here.

154
00:12:46.945 --> 00:12:48.625
You got any traffic warrants?

155
00:12:48.905 --> 00:12:50.105
Can you fix them?

156
00:12:57.305 --> 00:12:59.625
Almost time. Are we taping this?

157
00:12:59.905 --> 00:13:02.825
Yes, so we can watch it
over and over again.

158
00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:04.425
Take the stairs.

159
00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:07.785
Nick, get your feet off the table.
You too, Martin.

160
00:13:07.985 --> 00:13:10.985
- The color's no good.
- It's fine. You'll mess it up.

161
00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:12.705
I want you to look good.

162
00:13:12.905 --> 00:13:13.785
Unplug it.

163
00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:15.066
That's your sister!

164
00:13:15.506 --> 00:13:16.706
Picture's perfect.

165
00:13:16.906 --> 00:13:17.906
Yeah?

166
00:13:19.186 --> 00:13:20.106
Do I know you?

167
00:13:20.746 --> 00:13:21.786
Yes, sir.

168
00:13:21.986 --> 00:13:24.506
We had a long talk about a week ago.

169
00:13:24.746 --> 00:13:25.826
About what?

170
00:13:26.106 --> 00:13:27.666
Your new hobby room.

171
00:13:27.946 --> 00:13:29.586
This is George.

172
00:13:32.506 --> 00:13:34.426
Did you sense that I liked you?

173
00:13:35.626 --> 00:13:36.786
Yes, sir.

174
00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:39.426
Sit down and be quiet.

175
00:13:42.786 --> 00:13:45.946
- What are you eating?
- My tuna fish sandwich.

176
00:13:46.186 --> 00:13:47.106
Tuna?

177
00:13:47.706 --> 00:13:49.506
You can't eat tuna!

178
00:13:49.946 --> 00:13:51.426
Dad killed Flipper.

179
00:13:51.626 --> 00:13:53.267
We're boycotting tuna...

180
00:13:53.547 --> 00:13:57.507
...because they kill the dolphins
that get caught in the nets.

181
00:13:58.147 --> 00:13:59.227
Have ham.

182
00:13:59.467 --> 00:14:00.747
Eat Miss Piggy.

183
00:14:01.867 --> 00:14:04.187
- I'm sorry!
- It's only my eye.

184
00:14:09.147 --> 00:14:11.147
Oh, my God! It's coming on!

185
00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:15.227
My baby!

186
00:14:16.307 --> 00:14:18.827
Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?

187
00:14:27.707 --> 00:14:29.348
When the time has come...

188
00:14:30.068 --> 00:14:32.068
...and the moment is right...

189
00:14:33.068 --> 00:14:34.228
...remember...

190
00:14:34.748 --> 00:14:37.068
...use Ramses' Extra condoms.

191
00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.428
- We do!
- Ramses' Extra.

192
00:14:41.188 --> 00:14:44.428
Because caring means
all the protection you can get.

193
00:14:53.748 --> 00:14:55.228
Take the kids upstairs.

194
00:14:56.148 --> 00:14:57.908
We learn this in Human Development.

195
00:14:58.188 --> 00:15:00.828
In Human what?!
Human Development what?!

196
00:15:01.028 --> 00:15:02.508
Chill out, Daddy.

197
00:15:02.748 --> 00:15:04.108
Upstairs!

198
00:15:04.348 --> 00:15:05.868
Nick, upstairs.

199
00:15:06.388 --> 00:15:08.549
You know how your father is.

200
00:15:08.789 --> 00:15:11.349
- I looked fat.
- I liked you.

201
00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:14.989
Home. Out!

202
00:15:15.789 --> 00:15:16.829
I got a gun.

203
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:24.629
What? She looked beautiful.

204
00:15:24.869 --> 00:15:28.229
I liked it. She made me want to buy
rubbers right now.

205
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:38.549
I thought it was great.
Rianne, that was...

206
00:15:39.469 --> 00:15:41.789
- I thought you were terrific.
- Really?

207
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:44.310
I think she's got a hell of a future.

208
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.910
George is afraid. He's going home.

209
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.350
Stick around.

210
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.150
He has a gun.

211
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.590
It's an old gun
and he's not a very good shot.

212
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.990
That's good. I'm going anyway.
Good night.

213
00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.870
- I'll buy you a beer.
- You let him buy it.

214
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.070
You're under 21. Be back by midnight.

215
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.670
Wait and see. Cops never let up.

216
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.910
I'll have rubbers on my desk,
rubbers in the mail, in the coffee...

217
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.590
If you'd only kept your mouth shut!
I'm going for a walk.

218
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.830
Give the boys some credit.
In one ear, out the rubber.

219
00:16:31.831 --> 00:16:34.151
How goes it with you, Hans?

220
00:16:34.351 --> 00:16:36.511
Okay. You, Pieter?

221
00:16:37.511 --> 00:16:40.471
That's quite enough of that.
Come on over here, Hans.

222
00:16:42.511 --> 00:16:45.511
Mind the plastic.
I'm having painting done.

223
00:16:46.831 --> 00:16:48.591
The important thing is...

224
00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:49.831
...are you okay?

225
00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:51.991
No bones broken?

226
00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:53.831
I'm fine, thanks.

227
00:16:54.591 --> 00:16:56.031
Just bumps and bruises, eh?

228
00:16:56.671 --> 00:16:58.031
Yeah, that's all.

229
00:16:58.271 --> 00:16:59.632
Good, good.

230
00:17:03.192 --> 00:17:06.152
However, we lost over $1 million
in Krugerrand.

231
00:17:07.512 --> 00:17:10.672
I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.

232
00:17:11.312 --> 00:17:12.512
It happens.

233
00:17:12.872 --> 00:17:14.712
It's not your fault.

234
00:17:15.032 --> 00:17:18.032
Sometimes things do not go as planned.

235
00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:22.312
As you say, they just happen,
Eh, Pieter?

236
00:17:30.472 --> 00:17:33.632
You give a whole new meaning
to the word, "drop cloth. "

237
00:17:35.312 --> 00:17:38.633
Certain policemen have become
an intolerable nuisance.

238
00:17:39.233 --> 00:17:43.713
They are obviously on to us again.
How do you propose to handle it?

239
00:17:44.073 --> 00:17:45.393
Warn them off.

240
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.913
It's my experience...

241
00:17:49.353 --> 00:17:52.673
...that a scared cop
is more useful than a dead one.

242
00:17:52.913 --> 00:17:54.073
A warning?

243
00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:56.393
Is that not a bit tame?

244
00:17:56.833 --> 00:17:58.233
Depends on how you do it.

245
00:18:00.233 --> 00:18:02.153
Then you better look at this.

246
00:18:08.593 --> 00:18:11.913
This is the policeman in charge.

247
00:18:14.514 --> 00:18:15.714
A Kaffir.

248
00:18:17.434 --> 00:18:18.594
Lovely.

249
00:18:19.754 --> 00:18:21.394
Remember to take these in order.

250
00:18:22.274 --> 00:18:25.114
There's a packet
for each day of the week.

251
00:18:27.034 --> 00:18:28.434
This yours?

252
00:18:29.114 --> 00:18:30.794
I found it in the wash.

253
00:18:37.394 --> 00:18:38.954
I keep losing this.

254
00:18:40.114 --> 00:18:41.354
Something's wrong.

255
00:18:41.714 --> 00:18:45.114
No, not really.
It's just a goddamn pen.

256
00:18:48.074 --> 00:18:49.434
What about the pen?

257
00:18:49.954 --> 00:18:51.795
It reminds me of something.

258
00:18:52.795 --> 00:18:54.035
Of what?

259
00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:56.315
It reminds me of...

260
00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.475
...the night Vicki was killed.

261
00:18:59.635 --> 00:19:01.075
I didn't mean to push.

262
00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:05.275
That's okay.
We never really talked about this.

263
00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:14.795
I was to meet her for dinner.
One of those romantic dinners for two.

264
00:19:15.075 --> 00:19:16.275
I had so much work.

265
00:19:18.755 --> 00:19:20.555
And I forgot about it.

266
00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:26.315
She waited at the restaurant
for an hour before she drove home.

267
00:19:28.116 --> 00:19:32.276
It was midnight when I got home
to a ringing phone. I answered it.

268
00:19:32.516 --> 00:19:34.996
They said she was killed in a car crash.

269
00:19:40.516 --> 00:19:43.516
If I'd been driving,
we'd have been all right.

270
00:19:46.196 --> 00:19:50.196
I remember falling down
on my knees and shaking all over.

271
00:19:50.516 --> 00:19:53.196
I remember thinking, "I'm losing it. "

272
00:19:54.356 --> 00:19:56.716
There I was lying on the floor...

273
00:19:58.196 --> 00:20:02.236
...and I'm seeing under the couch,
and I see this gold pen.

274
00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:08.357
Just lying there. I'd been looking
for it for two months. There it is.

275
00:20:10.197 --> 00:20:12.197
She wasn't a great housekeeper.

276
00:20:13.877 --> 00:20:17.597
This voice goes off in my head,
like a drill instructor.

277
00:20:18.557 --> 00:20:20.877
It said, "Get up! Now!"

278
00:20:22.397 --> 00:20:26.717
I didn't feel like it, but I got up.
Muscles were still working.

279
00:20:27.237 --> 00:20:29.677
Then I drove to the hospital...

280
00:20:29.997 --> 00:20:33.157
...identified her, signed her out
with my gold pen.

281
00:20:33.397 --> 00:20:35.717
Trish found a gold pen in the laundry.

282
00:20:45.918 --> 00:20:48.078
Look around you, Sam.

283
00:20:49.758 --> 00:20:51.238
One day, Sam...

284
00:20:52.278 --> 00:20:53.918
...this'll all be yours.

285
00:20:57.518 --> 00:21:00.598
Find a nice bitch,
raise a couple of pups.

286
00:21:01.438 --> 00:21:03.758
A man could be happy here.

287
00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:11.918
Anybody tell you if you sit on
cold rocks too long, you get piles?

288
00:21:12.198 --> 00:21:13.798
Let's go watch TV.

289
00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:44.201
Kaffirs!

290
00:22:47.721 --> 00:22:49.281
Wondering about your kids?

291
00:22:50.361 --> 00:22:52.521
About what we've done to them?

292
00:22:53.481 --> 00:22:56.001
If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.

293
00:22:57.161 --> 00:22:59.321
I'd be going fucking bananas.

294
00:23:00.401 --> 00:23:02.041
Want to know what we've done?

295
00:23:02.641 --> 00:23:03.521
Shall I tell you?

296
00:23:05.561 --> 00:23:08.281
Just let your imagination run wild.

297
00:23:09.001 --> 00:23:10.921
This has just been a warning.

298
00:23:11.241 --> 00:23:14.882
After this, it gets bloody.
Tell your people to back off.

299
00:23:15.242 --> 00:23:17.002
Don't be a smart Kaffir.

300
00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:19.242
Maybe we let you live, huh?

301
00:23:40.082 --> 00:23:43.082
- You didn't see a face?
- Not one. They had on hoods.

302
00:23:43.442 --> 00:23:44.722
What about a voice?

303
00:23:44.922 --> 00:23:49.442
That crazy motherfucker who did talk
had a strange accent.

304
00:23:49.763 --> 00:23:54.443
Not German, not English.
Kind of guttural. Really shitty accent.

305
00:23:54.723 --> 00:23:58.043
Wait. Anything like what we chased
the other night?

306
00:23:58.443 --> 00:24:00.763
Yeah, kind of like that.

307
00:24:01.123 --> 00:24:02.603
Trish and the kids?

308
00:24:02.803 --> 00:24:05.723
They're at her sister's house
in Bellflower.

309
00:24:05.963 --> 00:24:10.123
Listen up! You heard what happened
to Rog last night?

310
00:24:10.643 --> 00:24:12.603
Forensics get back with anything?

311
00:24:12.883 --> 00:24:14.883
Not yet. They'll keep us posted.

312
00:24:15.243 --> 00:24:18.563
We got to watch each other's
backs and fronts.

313
00:24:18.803 --> 00:24:22.643
You can all watch my back
in poker tomorrow. You in?

314
00:24:22.923 --> 00:24:25.723
- If we catch these assholes.
- Count me in.

315
00:24:31.484 --> 00:24:33.964
I got something special for you.

316
00:24:34.324 --> 00:24:37.324
Leo Getz has been placed
in protective custody.

317
00:24:37.604 --> 00:24:41.244
You guys are going to baby-sit
until Washington sends the Feds.

318
00:24:41.604 --> 00:24:44.804
- How long?
- Until the red tape is processed.

319
00:24:44.884 --> 00:24:46.244
Couple, three days.

320
00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:50.644
Getz is going to testify
before a commission of inquiry.

321
00:24:50.924 --> 00:24:52.924
Drugs, laundered money, etc.

322
00:24:53.484 --> 00:24:54.404
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

323
00:24:57.004 --> 00:24:58.684
This is not a shit assignment.

324
00:24:59.004 --> 00:25:00.844
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

325
00:25:01.284 --> 00:25:02.004
It isn't.

326
00:25:02.324 --> 00:25:03.204
It is.

327
00:25:03.524 --> 00:25:05.365
Shut up, both of you.

328
00:25:06.445 --> 00:25:08.125
I've guaranteed his safety.

329
00:25:08.365 --> 00:25:09.204
Why us?

330
00:25:09.205 --> 00:25:12.365
You two are the most qualified. And...

331
00:25:12.645 --> 00:25:15.605
...after last night,
you could use the break.

332
00:25:15.845 --> 00:25:17.125
I can handle last night.

333
00:25:18.285 --> 00:25:19.645
What do we do with him?

334
00:25:19.845 --> 00:25:21.365
Take him to Disneyland.

335
00:25:22.205 --> 00:25:24.125
This stinks. This stinks.

336
00:25:24.365 --> 00:25:28.845
I don't give a fuck! I don't have an
ulcer because I know when to say that.

337
00:25:29.125 --> 00:25:30.645
Here's where he's staying.

338
00:25:30.885 --> 00:25:35.165
A nice hotel. The Justice Department
is paying. Enjoy yourselves.

339
00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:37.645
One more thing.

340
00:25:40.565 --> 00:25:41.685
Know what that says?

341
00:25:42.046 --> 00:25:44.726
Yeah. Same thing as that,
but I don't give a fuck.

342
00:25:48.726 --> 00:25:51.406
You're lucky.
I have to live with that.

343
00:26:02.726 --> 00:26:04.286
What room is that for?

344
00:26:04.646 --> 00:26:05.486
612.

345
00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:10.126
This is it. 612.

346
00:26:13.486 --> 00:26:14.766
Police.

347
00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:16.126
How do I know that?

348
00:26:16.606 --> 00:26:20.007
After I shoot you, you can
examine the bullet. Open up.

349
00:26:21.927 --> 00:26:24.087
Don't you want to see a badge?

350
00:26:24.327 --> 00:26:25.807
- Where's your badge?
- Shut up.

351
00:26:26.007 --> 00:26:28.327
I get it. Bad cop, good cop.

352
00:26:28.607 --> 00:26:29.927
Shut up.

353
00:26:31.167 --> 00:26:33.607
Bad cop, bad cop.
I know the routines.

354
00:26:33.847 --> 00:26:36.767
- Are you Leo Getz?
- That's me, Leo Getz.

355
00:26:37.007 --> 00:26:40.487
Whatever you need, Leo gets. Get it?

356
00:26:41.007 --> 00:26:43.847
I use that to break the ice
when I meet people.

357
00:26:44.127 --> 00:26:46.247
I'm Sgt. Murtaugh, this is Sgt. Riggs.

358
00:26:46.447 --> 00:26:49.367
Nice to meet you.
So what do I call you guys?

359
00:26:49.607 --> 00:26:50.927
Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.

360
00:26:51.127 --> 00:26:52.967
We're going to be your shadow.

361
00:26:55.127 --> 00:26:57.128
That's fine. Hey, an old-fashioned...

362
00:26:58.648 --> 00:27:01.688
Okay. I just ain't seen one
in a long time.

363
00:27:01.968 --> 00:27:04.288
I didn't think anyone used them anymore.

364
00:27:04.888 --> 00:27:08.048
I bet the kid's got an automatic.
Have you?

365
00:27:08.328 --> 00:27:09.368
Yep, a Beretta.

366
00:27:11.728 --> 00:27:13.168
You sure you guys are cops?

367
00:27:14.168 --> 00:27:17.008
Better watch how you treat me.
I'm a state witness.

368
00:27:17.248 --> 00:27:18.528
Star witness.

369
00:27:19.568 --> 00:27:21.128
We'll take that room.

370
00:27:22.048 --> 00:27:24.488
I already have my stuff in this room.

371
00:27:32.248 --> 00:27:36.409
It's yours, okay?
I'll move it in the small room.

372
00:27:36.729 --> 00:27:40.089
I'm the smallest guy here.
I'll take the small room.

373
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:44.569
Hey, loosen up, guys!
We're going to be together a long time.

374
00:27:45.489 --> 00:27:46.249
I'll get it.

375
00:27:47.769 --> 00:27:49.329
It's only room service.

376
00:27:50.089 --> 00:27:52.929
You hungry? I'll call
for anything you want.

377
00:27:53.209 --> 00:27:55.009
See this silk robe? Free.

378
00:27:55.689 --> 00:27:57.409
- It's not free.
- Yes, it is.

379
00:27:57.689 --> 00:28:00.689
- It's taxpayers' money.
- Same thing.

380
00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:05.769
Morning, gentlemen.

381
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:13.450
That's my food. You guys
didn't want anything. Bring it here.

382
00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.450
It's mine.

383
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.050
You could have had something.

384
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.050
I ordered eggs, not hamburger.

385
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.690
Not the window!

386
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:32.610
Shit!

387
00:28:58.331 --> 00:28:59.811
Where is that son-of-a-bitch?

388
00:29:01.611 --> 00:29:04.371
Somebody stop that guy! Stop him!

389
00:29:06.171 --> 00:29:09.011
Don't leave me! I can't swim!

390
00:29:15.171 --> 00:29:19.771
We're near the edge of the pool.
Now get the fuck off my back!

391
00:29:20.171 --> 00:29:22.491
Clear! Get back! Police!

392
00:29:23.851 --> 00:29:24.811
You okay?

393
00:29:25.011 --> 00:29:27.692
Where were you?
Why didn't you follow me?

394
00:29:27.972 --> 00:29:30.212
- Yeah, why didn't you?
- I was 7 floors up!

395
00:29:32.132 --> 00:29:33.532
- He hit me.
- Good!

396
00:29:36.012 --> 00:29:40.972
This guy took a big chance to pop all of
us. What'd you witness, a murder?

397
00:29:41.212 --> 00:29:43.252
Nothing like that. Honest.

398
00:29:45.852 --> 00:29:50.292
All I did was launder a half a billion
dollars in drug money.

399
00:29:51.372 --> 00:29:53.372
Half a billion dollars?!

400
00:29:53.692 --> 00:29:57.212
More or less.
Who can count that much money?

401
00:29:57.532 --> 00:30:00.932
Could I have some cotton balls
for my nose?

402
00:30:01.372 --> 00:30:03.052
Could you shut the fuck up?

403
00:30:03.733 --> 00:30:05.373
You're supposed to take care of me.

404
00:30:05.733 --> 00:30:06.573
Shut up!

405
00:30:07.893 --> 00:30:11.373
Mr. Getz got away.
Our best opportunity and he gets away.

406
00:30:11.733 --> 00:30:16.213
He slips through our fingers
and into the hands of the police.

407
00:30:17.053 --> 00:30:18.333
What are you doing?

408
00:30:19.253 --> 00:30:22.573
Checking to see
if I was standing on plastic.

409
00:30:23.413 --> 00:30:25.053
Okay, I got it.

410
00:30:25.893 --> 00:30:29.253
I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.
I work in a bank.

411
00:30:29.573 --> 00:30:32.213
You have money to launder.
What do you do?

412
00:30:32.413 --> 00:30:33.733
Bring it to you.

413
00:30:35.173 --> 00:30:38.093
- He does.
- I don't understand. Why me?

414
00:30:38.373 --> 00:30:39.693
Who am I?

415
00:30:41.694 --> 00:30:44.094
You're a courier. You work for him.

416
00:30:44.374 --> 00:30:45.694
I'm the drug dealer.

417
00:30:49.254 --> 00:30:52.854
Don't you have plates? What is this?

418
00:30:55.014 --> 00:30:59.534
I deposit the cash into the account
of a dummy finance company.

419
00:31:00.774 --> 00:31:02.214
I issue you a cashier's check...

420
00:31:02.774 --> 00:31:06.614
...in his name,
minus a small commission for myself.

421
00:31:07.374 --> 00:31:08.574
- The other end.
- You like breathing?

422
00:31:08.774 --> 00:31:09.774
How much?

423
00:31:10.054 --> 00:31:11.094
2%.

424
00:31:11.774 --> 00:31:14.294
Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.

425
00:31:16.814 --> 00:31:19.975
You return it to me as collateral
on a loan I make to you.

426
00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:23.775
But you don't pay back the loan.
You keep the money.

427
00:31:24.055 --> 00:31:25.055
How's that work?

428
00:31:25.415 --> 00:31:27.815
That's it! Don't you get it?

429
00:31:28.135 --> 00:31:31.975
It's your money. You don't pay it back.
And it's clean.

430
00:31:32.295 --> 00:31:34.495
It is now laundered.

431
00:31:35.975 --> 00:31:37.815
You cops aren't too bright.

432
00:31:39.975 --> 00:31:42.135
This is the best part.

433
00:31:42.815 --> 00:31:45.655
You take a tax deduction...

434
00:31:46.255 --> 00:31:49.575
...on interest payments
you don't even make.

435
00:31:51.095 --> 00:31:53.335
- Am I a genius?
- You're a swindler.

436
00:31:53.615 --> 00:31:54.575
Cheat.

437
00:31:55.015 --> 00:31:56.216
Come on!

438
00:31:56.856 --> 00:32:00.816
Everyone cheats. Look at the Pentagon.
So you got it?

439
00:32:02.856 --> 00:32:05.776
So how come you turned yourself in,
Mr. Big Shot?

440
00:32:06.336 --> 00:32:08.576
I was scamming those guys for months.

441
00:32:09.016 --> 00:32:11.016
Every transaction, I kept a little.

442
00:32:11.296 --> 00:32:12.096
You?

443
00:32:12.696 --> 00:32:14.856
It was easy. Cash deposits...

444
00:32:15.136 --> 00:32:18.456
...millions of dollars in small bills
changing hands.

445
00:32:18.696 --> 00:32:21.736
Who's going to miss $10,000 here,
$20,000 there?

446
00:32:22.616 --> 00:32:23.336
Drug dealers.

447
00:32:24.696 --> 00:32:26.376
That's right. They did.

448
00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:29.296
That's why I'm living
out of a suitcase now.

449
00:32:31.856 --> 00:32:33.457
You can give that to Nick.

450
00:32:34.217 --> 00:32:37.217
But it's softer.
I put a fabric softener in there.

451
00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:38.497
It's small, Leroy.

452
00:32:38.697 --> 00:32:42.897
It's Leo, not Leroy.
I'll buy you another shirt.

453
00:32:43.137 --> 00:32:45.897
Just give me the names
of those drug dealers.

454
00:32:46.137 --> 00:32:47.817
I don't know any.

455
00:32:48.057 --> 00:32:50.057
I just dealt with the couriers.

456
00:32:50.337 --> 00:32:52.177
Where does Trish keep my laundry?

457
00:32:52.377 --> 00:32:54.217
Behind the machine.

458
00:32:55.737 --> 00:32:58.057
You never met anyone except couriers?

459
00:32:59.577 --> 00:33:01.177
No names.

460
00:33:04.417 --> 00:33:08.897
Wait a minute, come to think of it!
Okay, listen.

461
00:33:09.257 --> 00:33:12.738
They took me up in the hills
to a house on stilts.

462
00:33:13.258 --> 00:33:16.258
And I had a job interview with a guy...

463
00:33:16.538 --> 00:33:18.498
...and his name was...

464
00:33:19.418 --> 00:33:20.898
Haynes! Hans!

465
00:33:21.178 --> 00:33:23.418
- Take us there.
- We have to sit on this guy.

466
00:33:23.778 --> 00:33:25.578
It won't hurt to look.

467
00:33:25.938 --> 00:33:26.858
I know the address.

468
00:33:27.058 --> 00:33:27.818
Let's go.

469
00:33:28.098 --> 00:33:29.098
We shouldn't do this!

470
00:33:29.538 --> 00:33:31.418
Come on, don't be a killjoy!

471
00:33:31.778 --> 00:33:34.258
We're back! You're black, I'm mad.

472
00:33:34.458 --> 00:33:36.098
This is going to be great!

473
00:33:36.458 --> 00:33:39.258
If we're going, shouldn't I have a gun?

474
00:33:41.938 --> 00:33:44.258
Is my nose still bleeding?
It's really sore.

475
00:33:44.538 --> 00:33:46.218
Sorry about that.

476
00:33:50.819 --> 00:33:52.659
It should be coming up soon.

477
00:33:53.059 --> 00:33:55.379
- 9856.
- That's it.

478
00:33:55.659 --> 00:33:59.059
- That's another possibility.
- This is the ninth possibility, Leo.

479
00:33:59.339 --> 00:34:02.379
That's it. Nine.
My lucky number. Nine.

480
00:34:02.659 --> 00:34:04.659
Stay in the car.

481
00:34:06.019 --> 00:34:07.819
- Can't I come?
- Stay.

482
00:34:10.019 --> 00:34:11.339
Nice car.

483
00:34:11.899 --> 00:34:13.739
- What are you doing?
- Hooking it up.

484
00:34:14.019 --> 00:34:16.019
You're not being careful!

485
00:34:16.299 --> 00:34:18.739
I know what I'm doing. It's a car...

486
00:34:18.899 --> 00:34:20.259
...not a baby carriage.

487
00:34:20.499 --> 00:34:22.739
You're chipping the paint.

488
00:34:23.859 --> 00:34:26.700
- You smell what I smell?
- I smell it.

489
00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.340
A rat?

490
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.740
A real stinky one.

491
00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.580
Where you going?

492
00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:40.100
I'm a peeping Tom. It goes
with the badge. It's fun sometimes.

493
00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.460
Bingo!

494
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.940
Lars, look!

495
00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.260
What the fuck?!

496
00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:56.980
Where's the pool?

497
00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.200
No pool.

498
00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.380
- Of course there is.
- This house is built on stilts.

499
00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.741
I'm sure there's a pool.

500
00:35:15.461 --> 00:35:16.861
Cuff yourselves.

501
00:35:44.662 --> 00:35:46.022
Move that truck!

502
00:35:47.622 --> 00:35:48.782
Your keys!

503
00:35:51.142 --> 00:35:52.342
You all right?

504
00:35:53.182 --> 00:35:54.262
Where you going?

505
00:35:54.462 --> 00:35:55.942
That was the waiter from the hotel.

506
00:35:56.102 --> 00:35:57.182
Wait for me!

507
00:35:57.502 --> 00:35:58.942
Get the fuck out of here!

508
00:35:59.182 --> 00:36:01.862
What are you doing?!
You can't take my truck!

509
00:36:16.382 --> 00:36:18.823
Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!

510
00:36:18.983 --> 00:36:20.303
Where did he go?

511
00:36:20.703 --> 00:36:23.023
Riggs is hanging on the truck!

512
00:36:23.223 --> 00:36:26.543
What are you doing out of the car?
Get in the car!

513
00:36:27.223 --> 00:36:29.703
Get back! It's police business!

514
00:36:30.063 --> 00:36:32.543
It's a high-speed chase!
Get out of the way!

515
00:36:51.903 --> 00:36:54.583
I love it! We got to catch him!

516
00:37:10.184 --> 00:37:11.704
Hello, asshole.

517
00:37:42.585 --> 00:37:43.625
Give me that!

518
00:37:59.825 --> 00:38:02.305
There they are! Hurry up!

519
00:38:02.585 --> 00:38:04.305
Can't you go faster?!

520
00:38:04.585 --> 00:38:06.745
Will you shut the fuck up?

521
00:39:24.348 --> 00:39:26.668
Wipe out. It's under control.

522
00:39:26.828 --> 00:39:28.828
I told you to look out!

523
00:39:31.348 --> 00:39:33.988
- You're too old for this.
- Shut up! Yak-yak-yak.

524
00:39:34.188 --> 00:39:35.228
And stay!

525
00:39:35.508 --> 00:39:37.508
What do you think I am, a dog?

526
00:39:51.748 --> 00:39:53.348
Hands behind your neck!

527
00:39:58.268 --> 00:40:01.589
What are you guys doing here?
We got a lot to talk about.

528
00:40:01.989 --> 00:40:03.389
What is going on?

529
00:40:03.509 --> 00:40:04.749
Freeze!

530
00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:06.269
Get down here!

531
00:40:06.429 --> 00:40:08.109
Come on, it's been a bad day.

532
00:40:08.549 --> 00:40:09.589
Show me your hands.

533
00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:13.269
Take it easy, officer. I'm not armed.

534
00:40:13.949 --> 00:40:15.549
I won't resist.

535
00:40:16.269 --> 00:40:20.389
Put down your guns, gentlemen.
It's all right. Do as I say!

536
00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:26.709
Hands on your head.

537
00:40:27.629 --> 00:40:29.229
Behind your head!

538
00:40:29.549 --> 00:40:31.309
You have no idea what you're doing.

539
00:40:31.949 --> 00:40:35.949
We're professional police officers.
We do this for a living.

540
00:40:36.389 --> 00:40:38.389
My name is Arjen Rudd.

541
00:40:38.629 --> 00:40:42.910
I'm Minister of Diplomatic Affairs
for the South African consulate.

542
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:46.070
South Africa. Home of the Krugerrand.

543
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.910
Among other things.

544
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.630
These men also work for the consulate.

545
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.670
We have diplomatic credentials...

546
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:57.070
Keep your hands out of there.

547
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.430
Everybody, take it easy.
Especially you, Riggs.

548
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:09.670
Riggs?

549
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.510
You're Martin Riggs?

550
00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.830
From Chicago. What's your name?
What's his name?

551
00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:16.671
Pieter Von... Vor...

552
00:41:16.831 --> 00:41:18.791
I'll just call you Adolf.

553
00:41:19.511 --> 00:41:23.671
Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?
That's you.

554
00:41:24.471 --> 00:41:25.791
It's official.

555
00:41:27.111 --> 00:41:28.351
They are official.

556
00:41:29.311 --> 00:41:31.631
Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...

557
00:41:31.871 --> 00:41:35.351
...no diplomatic agent
may be detained or arrested...

558
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:38.631
...once his identity
has been established.

559
00:41:40.551 --> 00:41:43.871
We have a serious
diplomatic situation here...

560
00:41:44.191 --> 00:41:47.791
...which I will take up
with your State Department tomorrow.

561
00:41:48.031 --> 00:41:51.151
I'm quaking in my boots,
but I'll still bring you down.

562
00:41:52.231 --> 00:41:54.032
My dear officer...

563
00:41:55.072 --> 00:41:57.872
...you could not even give me
a parking ticket.

564
00:42:00.552 --> 00:42:02.872
Who is the dickhead now, huh?

565
00:42:06.552 --> 00:42:11.392
The South African government owns
this house. This is South African soil.

566
00:42:11.832 --> 00:42:13.512
Now get out of here.

567
00:42:14.792 --> 00:42:15.952
All of you.

568
00:42:24.592 --> 00:42:26.232
Don't do it.

569
00:42:26.512 --> 00:42:30.512
Don't do it or I'll make you
eat this fucking thing.

570
00:42:33.273 --> 00:42:34.433
Kaffir.

571
00:42:43.593 --> 00:42:46.753
Could you step out of the car, please?

572
00:42:48.793 --> 00:42:51.113
Put them away. I'm sorry.

573
00:42:52.873 --> 00:42:54.313
Sorry. Are you okay?

574
00:42:56.273 --> 00:42:57.273
Don't open that.

575
00:42:58.273 --> 00:42:59.953
That is a diplomatic pouch...

576
00:43:00.233 --> 00:43:03.953
...protected under Article 27
of the Vienna Convention.

577
00:43:04.233 --> 00:43:06.233
Is he serious with this stuff?

578
00:43:07.793 --> 00:43:12.274
These are police officers, Miss
Van den Haas. They were just leaving.

579
00:43:14.914 --> 00:43:16.874
She is a consulate secretary.

580
00:43:17.794 --> 00:43:19.634
Give her back the briefcase.

581
00:43:22.314 --> 00:43:23.914
Give it to her.

582
00:43:26.154 --> 00:43:28.634
I'm sorry, Miss Consulate Secretary.

583
00:43:30.594 --> 00:43:32.234
Don't talk to them! Come here.

584
00:43:32.474 --> 00:43:35.154
He's a nice guy.
What's he paying you an hour?

585
00:43:35.434 --> 00:43:38.074
Want to increase your pay?
Better hours?

586
00:43:45.274 --> 00:43:47.595
I'd start getting used
to that sort of view.

587
00:43:56.955 --> 00:43:58.755
It's the Triangle Trade again.

588
00:43:59.275 --> 00:44:04.115
Don't you know American history?
Molasses to rum to slaves.

589
00:44:04.395 --> 00:44:06.555
Now drugs to dollars to Krugerrands.

590
00:44:06.795 --> 00:44:10.555
I got a dead guy with a surfboard
where his face used to be...

591
00:44:10.795 --> 00:44:14.115
...and the State Department
breathing down our throats.

592
00:44:14.395 --> 00:44:18.875
I'll have to make a formal apology
to the South African consulate.

593
00:44:19.115 --> 00:44:22.755
Apologize? He's a sack of shit!
He's a crook.

594
00:44:22.955 --> 00:44:25.636
It doesn't matter. He's a diplomat.

595
00:44:25.916 --> 00:44:30.156
He has immunity. We can't touch him,
arrest him, prosecute him.

596
00:44:30.396 --> 00:44:33.556
- Does that spell it out for you?
- Yes, sir.

597
00:44:33.796 --> 00:44:36.996
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you.

598
00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:44.036
You took a civilian on a bust.
One you're supposed to be protecting!

599
00:44:44.276 --> 00:44:45.236
He's alive, isn't he?

600
00:44:45.436 --> 00:44:48.916
I signed a waiver.
Besides, I usually wait in the car.

601
00:44:49.156 --> 00:44:50.836
Usually?

602
00:44:51.156 --> 00:44:53.316
They're very adamant about that.

603
00:44:53.596 --> 00:44:55.676
- I don't give a fuck.
- They're good cops!

604
00:44:55.956 --> 00:44:58.996
They're the best.
One time, a guy was waiving a gun...!

605
00:44:59.356 --> 00:45:00.597
What did he say?

606
00:45:02.837 --> 00:45:03.957
What did he say?

607
00:45:04.197 --> 00:45:05.757
- "I don't give a fuck. "
- What's that mean?

608
00:45:05.957 --> 00:45:09.677
It's his mantra. Why is everyone
parked on my desk? Up!

609
00:45:11.037 --> 00:45:12.677
It's a rubber plant!

610
00:45:12.957 --> 00:45:15.677
It looks to be about a week's supply.

611
00:45:15.957 --> 00:45:16.957
Go spit.

612
00:45:17.197 --> 00:45:20.197
I forgot. You're too old for that shit.

613
00:45:22.877 --> 00:45:25.517
If you don't like it,
you can exchange it.

614
00:45:49.238 --> 00:45:51.398
One moment, Miss Van den Haas.

615
00:45:55.718 --> 00:45:58.718
I hope you understood
what happened here today.

616
00:45:59.078 --> 00:46:02.078
I'd rather not jump
to any wrong conclusions.

617
00:46:02.398 --> 00:46:04.558
Why don't you explain it to me?

618
00:46:04.918 --> 00:46:09.158
The policies of our government
are not popular here in America.

619
00:46:09.838 --> 00:46:13.358
The police department here
is overrun with blacks.

620
00:46:13.918 --> 00:46:16.919
They have badges and guns
and they hate us.

621
00:46:17.759 --> 00:46:19.919
Our consulate, its staff...

622
00:46:20.199 --> 00:46:24.439
...and particularly myself will always
be targets for their harassment.

623
00:46:45.279 --> 00:46:47.359
Things are getting out of hand.

624
00:46:47.639 --> 00:46:52.720
There are too many losses. We'll
move the cash in one large shipment.

625
00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.240
We'll need more than a suitcase.

626
00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.280
I'll worry about that.
You worry about the police.

627
00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.200
Your warning did not work.

628
00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.960
- Let's go, Leo!
- I'm coming.

629
00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.640
Come on! Move!

630
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.120
Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?

631
00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.640
I've got to eat, too.

632
00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.600
Give me the food.

633
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.760
Who ordered the super combo?

634
00:47:31.321 --> 00:47:33.001
I get a steak sandwich.

635
00:47:33.281 --> 00:47:34.281
Who gets Leo?

636
00:47:34.521 --> 00:47:38.841
You got a big empty house. I got
a trailer. What will I do with him?

637
00:47:39.121 --> 00:47:41.441
My place is too small. You take him.

638
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:43.001
I had him last night.

639
00:47:43.281 --> 00:47:44.841
Excuse me, fellows.

640
00:47:45.761 --> 00:47:48.001
This is tuna. I hate tuna.

641
00:47:48.281 --> 00:47:50.961
I refuse to get stuck with tuna.

642
00:47:51.841 --> 00:47:55.001
- Don't eat the tuna.
- I just said that!

643
00:47:55.361 --> 00:47:57.521
I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.

644
00:47:57.801 --> 00:47:59.441
We're not going back! Shut up!

645
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:02.521
Sure, don't go back.
Okay, don't go back!

646
00:48:02.801 --> 00:48:05.841
Let me give you
a friendly piece of advice.

647
00:48:06.201 --> 00:48:10.162
Never go through the drive-through.
Always walk up to the counter.

648
00:48:10.362 --> 00:48:12.042
Let me tell you why.

649
00:48:12.362 --> 00:48:15.802
They fuck you at the drive-through!

650
00:48:16.042 --> 00:48:20.042
They know you'll be miles away
before you find out you got fucked.

651
00:48:20.322 --> 00:48:22.802
You won't turn around and come back.

652
00:48:23.042 --> 00:48:25.562
So who gets fucked? Leo Getz.

653
00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:27.402
I'm not eating this tuna!

654
00:48:28.042 --> 00:48:29.402
Shut up!

655
00:49:44.284 --> 00:49:45.964
Get rid of that man.

656
00:49:48.964 --> 00:49:52.324
You're going to have
to leave the premises right now.

657
00:50:02.005 --> 00:50:03.525
The morning faxes.

658
00:50:40.686 --> 00:50:43.846
What's the matter?
He kick you out of the house?

659
00:50:44.806 --> 00:50:46.966
I want you to bite Leo for me.

660
00:50:58.526 --> 00:50:59.886
What are you doing?

661
00:51:00.726 --> 00:51:02.806
I'm cleaning up this pigsty.

662
00:51:03.046 --> 00:51:05.126
I like this pigsty.

663
00:51:05.366 --> 00:51:09.206
When did you last do the refrigerator?
Or the pan under it?

664
00:51:09.486 --> 00:51:10.806
There's a pan under there?

665
00:51:12.646 --> 00:51:14.767
Where's my phone?

666
00:51:15.647 --> 00:51:17.287
Where's my TV? What have you done?

667
00:51:17.487 --> 00:51:19.327
Everything is outside.

668
00:51:19.567 --> 00:51:21.127
Just stop what you're doing.

669
00:51:21.367 --> 00:51:24.367
- Get the dog out of here!
- You go before the mutt.

670
00:51:24.727 --> 00:51:26.567
Out, out! Oh, man.

671
00:51:31.727 --> 00:51:33.407
It's Collins.

672
00:51:33.847 --> 00:51:35.567
Has Murtaugh checked in with you?

673
00:51:35.847 --> 00:51:37.047
No. Why?

674
00:51:37.327 --> 00:51:40.407
I haven't heard from him.
He doesn't answer his phone.

675
00:51:41.487 --> 00:51:42.847
I'll be right there.

676
00:51:48.407 --> 00:51:50.087
Stay in the car.

677
00:51:57.608 --> 00:51:59.008
I'm upstairs!

678
00:51:59.408 --> 00:52:01.768
Should I call 999, officer in distress?

679
00:52:02.928 --> 00:52:04.048
I'll cover the back!

680
00:52:04.248 --> 00:52:06.608
- Where are you?
- I'm up here.

681
00:52:23.288 --> 00:52:24.448
In here.

682
00:52:39.449 --> 00:52:40.449
Good morning.

683
00:52:47.289 --> 00:52:48.809
First time in 20 years...

684
00:52:49.049 --> 00:52:51.089
...I get the bathroom to myself.

685
00:52:51.289 --> 00:52:54.809
No kids banging on the door.
No wife asking me to hurry up.

686
00:52:55.129 --> 00:52:58.649
Just me and my new
Saltwater Sportsman magazine!

687
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:11.170
The one with the article
on deep-sea fishing?

688
00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:24.330
So I'm reading about marlin
fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...

689
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:26.850
...when I glanced over.

690
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:33.690
Oh, Jesus.

691
00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:35.690
Is that all?

692
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:37.330
You scared the shit out of me.

693
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.370
Scared the shit out of you?

694
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:42.330
How long you been here?

695
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:44.531
I've been here all night.

696
00:53:44.851 --> 00:53:47.691
My legs are so numb
I don't know if I can...

697
00:53:47.971 --> 00:53:49.291
Don't move.

698
00:53:49.531 --> 00:53:50.691
I can't.

699
00:53:50.971 --> 00:53:52.851
Just stay that way. Do you mind?

700
00:53:54.651 --> 00:53:57.211
It's a dirty job,
but someone's got to do it.

701
00:54:11.971 --> 00:54:13.131
Tell me I'm not fucked.

702
00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:15.971
He's fucked.

703
00:54:18.171 --> 00:54:20.491
Okay, but I'd be lying.

704
00:54:22.052 --> 00:54:23.932
You'll be okay if you don't stand up.

705
00:54:24.172 --> 00:54:25.492
That's a relief.

706
00:54:25.852 --> 00:54:28.012
- I have to get help.
- No way!

707
00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:29.332
Why?

708
00:54:32.012 --> 00:54:34.292
I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.

709
00:54:34.532 --> 00:54:38.332
This is serious.
I got to get the bomb squad here.

710
00:54:38.612 --> 00:54:39.692
Bomb squad?

711
00:54:45.572 --> 00:54:47.692
Okay, call them in.

712
00:54:50.532 --> 00:54:53.012
Don't use the open frequency.

713
00:54:58.733 --> 00:55:00.693
Let's try to keep this quiet, okay?

714
00:55:01.373 --> 00:55:03.213
Sure. Trust me.

715
00:55:22.213 --> 00:55:23.893
An escort is really not necessary.

716
00:55:24.213 --> 00:55:27.733
I know you're a psychiatrist,
but it's not a pretty sight.

717
00:55:28.133 --> 00:55:31.653
I have helped policemen
through very traumatic moments.

718
00:55:31.893 --> 00:55:35.253
There is nothing in this room
that I cannot handle.

719
00:55:38.254 --> 00:55:39.574
I was wrong.

720
00:55:40.254 --> 00:55:41.574
Excuse me.

721
00:55:45.934 --> 00:55:48.534
I should've known,
where there's one, there's the other.

722
00:55:57.214 --> 00:55:59.214
You're a psychiatrist?
I have these dreams.

723
00:55:59.614 --> 00:56:01.254
It's ready to come out.

724
00:56:03.774 --> 00:56:05.774
I got to live in this house!

725
00:56:08.014 --> 00:56:09.094
Clear this room.

726
00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:11.894
Come on, Riggs.

727
00:56:16.375 --> 00:56:17.135
You, too, Riggs.

728
00:56:17.375 --> 00:56:18.295
No.

729
00:56:19.775 --> 00:56:21.615
Riggs, out.

730
00:56:29.015 --> 00:56:30.135
All right.

731
00:56:32.895 --> 00:56:34.135
Dive into the tub.

732
00:56:35.655 --> 00:56:37.975
Then pull the bomb blanket
over your head.

733
00:56:38.455 --> 00:56:42.255
This cast iron tub
will withstand a hell of a blast.

734
00:56:42.815 --> 00:56:43.775
I can't.

735
00:56:43.975 --> 00:56:47.135
He can't.
He's been on there for 18 hours.

736
00:56:47.415 --> 00:56:49.095
He can't even walk.

737
00:56:49.335 --> 00:56:51.136
I'm gonna have to help him.

738
00:56:51.976 --> 00:56:53.656
All right, you better wear this.

739
00:56:55.176 --> 00:56:55.976
The nitrogen?

740
00:56:56.456 --> 00:56:57.296
Almost there.

741
00:57:01.096 --> 00:57:04.496
He's spraying this thing
with liquid nitrogen...

742
00:57:04.816 --> 00:57:07.656
...to give you 1 or 2 seconds
before detonation.

743
00:57:07.936 --> 00:57:10.616
- Got that?
- 2 seconds. Thanks a lot.

744
00:57:10.936 --> 00:57:12.256
Lights out.

745
00:57:12.496 --> 00:57:14.016
Get him up and out.

746
00:57:22.496 --> 00:57:23.696
Good luck.

747
00:57:24.136 --> 00:57:25.616
You got a piece?

748
00:57:25.856 --> 00:57:27.856
- Yeah, a Smith and Wesson.
- Try this one.

749
00:57:28.137 --> 00:57:30.337
Safety's on. I'll collect it later.

750
00:57:32.137 --> 00:57:33.457
Good luck.

751
00:57:47.657 --> 00:57:49.377
Alone at last.

752
00:57:50.697 --> 00:57:53.537
Why didn't they plant the bomb
in Trish's stove?

753
00:57:54.057 --> 00:57:57.217
All the needless suffering
could have ended there.

754
00:58:10.738 --> 00:58:12.338
I'm going to die on a toilet.

755
00:58:13.058 --> 00:58:15.418
Guys like you don't die on toilets.

756
00:58:15.618 --> 00:58:18.458
And I'm here
and I don't plan on going now.

757
00:58:20.898 --> 00:58:22.138
Let's do it.

758
00:58:29.018 --> 00:58:32.418
On three.
Wait, let me get into the tub.

759
00:58:33.258 --> 00:58:35.098
I'm just going to give you...

760
00:58:35.538 --> 00:58:38.258
On three, huh? What do you say?

761
00:58:40.338 --> 00:58:41.778
One...

762
00:58:42.538 --> 00:58:43.739
...two...

763
00:58:44.019 --> 00:58:44.939
Wait.

764
00:58:46.939 --> 00:58:49.419
Do we do it on three, or...

765
00:58:50.099 --> 00:58:51.539
...one, two, three...

766
00:58:51.779 --> 00:58:55.459
- ... then do it?
- It's your ass. It's up to you.

767
00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:58.459
My ass, yeah.

768
00:58:58.699 --> 00:58:59.779
Three.

769
00:59:00.259 --> 00:59:01.619
We go on three?

770
00:59:01.819 --> 00:59:04.139
One, two and then three!

771
00:59:07.619 --> 00:59:08.699
One...

772
00:59:08.939 --> 00:59:10.219
Martin?

773
00:59:17.259 --> 00:59:18.739
I know.

774
00:59:19.459 --> 00:59:20.820
I mean it, man.

775
00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.580
I hear you.

776
00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:30.340
We're not going to die, all right?

777
00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:32.820
On three.

778
01:00:07.861 --> 01:00:11.261
Get off me. I don't want anybody
to see us like this.

779
01:00:15.381 --> 01:00:16.901
Mr. Jones?

780
01:00:17.661 --> 01:00:18.581
Sit down.

781
01:00:22.261 --> 01:00:24.381
What can I do for you today?

782
01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:27.701
I have this problem,
this very delicate matter.

783
01:00:27.941 --> 01:00:30.181
My friend wants to emigrate
to South Africa.

784
01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:32.661
Of course, I can help him do that.

785
01:00:33.741 --> 01:00:35.342
I want you to talk him out of it.

786
01:00:36.262 --> 01:00:37.182
Talk him out of it?

787
01:00:37.942 --> 01:00:39.382
Whatever for?

788
01:00:39.942 --> 01:00:43.542
This is a bad time for him to go,
with all the trouble.

789
01:00:44.142 --> 01:00:47.942
Have him come back later
in the week and we'll sit down...

790
01:00:47.982 --> 01:00:49.502
He's here.

791
01:00:49.742 --> 01:00:51.822
Yeah, he's here now. Alphonse?

792
01:01:02.262 --> 01:01:04.022
There must be some mistake.

793
01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:07.502
Say, what?

794
01:01:10.262 --> 01:01:13.823
Listen to your friend.
He knows what he's talking about.

795
01:01:14.023 --> 01:01:16.663
I don't think you want to go
to South Africa.

796
01:01:16.943 --> 01:01:17.983
Why not?

797
01:01:21.183 --> 01:01:22.503
Because you're black.

798
01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:27.063
You are.

799
01:01:27.303 --> 01:01:28.583
He is.

800
01:01:29.223 --> 01:01:31.983
Of course I am black.
That's why I want to go.

801
01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:35.183
To join my brothers in the struggle...

802
01:01:35.383 --> 01:01:37.303
...against the racist...

803
01:01:37.503 --> 01:01:38.223
...fascist...

804
01:01:38.423 --> 01:01:39.783
...white minority regime!

805
01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:41.023
Fascist regime!

806
01:01:41.263 --> 01:01:42.423
One man, one vote!

807
01:01:43.623 --> 01:01:45.943
Free South Africa, you son-of-a-bitch!

808
01:01:47.543 --> 01:01:50.944
I've heard as much as I want to.
You must leave.

809
01:01:53.024 --> 01:01:57.344
What's happening?
Don't touch me! Back off!

810
01:02:00.944 --> 01:02:03.184
Close the security gate! Quickly!

811
01:02:16.464 --> 01:02:18.064
End apartheid now!

812
01:02:19.504 --> 01:02:22.504
You going to arrest me
if I don't shut up?

813
01:02:36.025 --> 01:02:39.745
One man, one vote!
Free South Africa! Give me that flag!

814
01:02:42.505 --> 01:02:43.625
You can't push me out!

815
01:03:47.307 --> 01:03:49.107
You call this security?

816
01:03:49.347 --> 01:03:53.387
More people come in and out of here
than Grand Central Station.

817
01:03:57.307 --> 01:03:59.027
Wait, gentlemen!

818
01:03:59.227 --> 01:04:01.507
Don't bother to call the police.
I'm here already.

819
01:04:03.187 --> 01:04:04.627
I should have known.

820
01:04:07.387 --> 01:04:08.667
Well, well.

821
01:04:09.427 --> 01:04:10.507
The master race.

822
01:04:13.027 --> 01:04:15.787
I hope you realize
the trouble you are in right now.

823
01:04:16.467 --> 01:04:21.428
As usual, you people have everything
upside down and turned around.

824
01:04:21.668 --> 01:04:22.828
Gentlemen...

825
01:04:23.508 --> 01:04:26.188
...show Officer Riggs into the street.

826
01:04:31.508 --> 01:04:32.348
Fingers off.

827
01:04:32.628 --> 01:04:33.868
Hands off!

828
01:04:35.188 --> 01:04:36.508
Let me see that.

829
01:04:39.548 --> 01:04:43.348
That's a piece of hardware you got.
Where do you get that stuff?

830
01:04:43.708 --> 01:04:46.628
I've never seen it.
Where's it from, South Africa?

831
01:04:48.588 --> 01:04:49.308
Don't move.

832
01:04:56.549 --> 01:05:01.389
You haven't heard about me? I got a
bad reputation. Sometimes I go nuts.

833
01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:04.309
Don't move.

834
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:12.109
I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.
Or is it Aryan?

835
01:05:12.389 --> 01:05:14.389
Whatever the fuck your name is.

836
01:05:15.229 --> 01:05:17.069
You fold up your tents...

837
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:19.509
...and get out of my country...

838
01:05:19.989 --> 01:05:21.989
...and I won't do anything to you.

839
01:05:22.749 --> 01:05:24.269
I'll leave you alone.

840
01:05:24.469 --> 01:05:28.349
'Cause if you stick around here,
I'm gonna fuck your ass.

841
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:31.229
Send you home
with your balls in a sling.

842
01:05:32.749 --> 01:05:34.750
Just get out of here...

843
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:37.270
...Kaffir lover.

844
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:45.110
Eenie...

845
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:47.030
...meenie...

846
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:48.170
...miney...

847
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:51.150
Hey, Moe!

848
01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:56.790
Sorry, Adolf.

849
01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:00.790
Pick them up with your hands.

850
01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:05.790
Big smile. Big smile!

851
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:10.110
Vorstedt, come here.

852
01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:11.711
Vorstedt!

853
01:06:15.791 --> 01:06:18.791
- Hello, Officer...?
- Martin Riggs.

854
01:06:19.071 --> 01:06:20.391
What are you doing here?

855
01:06:20.631 --> 01:06:23.791
I've been with your boss...
shooting the breeze.

856
01:06:24.151 --> 01:06:25.631
Shooting his fish.

857
01:06:38.311 --> 01:06:42.431
The guy goes,
"But, but, but... you're black!"

858
01:06:45.671 --> 01:06:46.991
He's black.

859
01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:48.952
No shit.

860
01:06:49.552 --> 01:06:50.672
He started some shit!

861
01:06:50.952 --> 01:06:52.512
You get into Rudd's office?

862
01:06:52.752 --> 01:06:54.112
I got up there.

863
01:06:54.352 --> 01:06:59.192
Aryan Crud and his Brown Shirts
turned up, but I ripped this off a pad.

864
01:06:59.792 --> 01:07:02.672
"Alba Varden, Thursday. " Alba Varden?

865
01:07:03.432 --> 01:07:05.032
Isn't that Hitler's girlfriend?

866
01:07:05.272 --> 01:07:06.512
That's Eva Braun.

867
01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:08.632
He has a date with her Thursday.

868
01:07:08.872 --> 01:07:10.672
Her name sounds familiar.

869
01:07:11.032 --> 01:07:15.192
I don't know her.
It just sounds familiar. Alba Varden.

870
01:07:15.512 --> 01:07:18.192
A deli! Let's eat. I'm starving.

871
01:07:18.792 --> 01:07:19.712
I'll spring.

872
01:07:19.952 --> 01:07:21.872
Let's go. Sounds good.

873
01:07:27.153 --> 01:07:29.953
- Get out the other side, Leo.
- It's okay!

874
01:07:30.793 --> 01:07:31.633
No cars.

875
01:07:52.913 --> 01:07:54.553
That policeman.

876
01:08:05.834 --> 01:08:07.594
You should pick from the bottom.

877
01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:09.514
They put the old stuff on top.

878
01:08:09.754 --> 01:08:10.834
Officer Riggs!

879
01:08:13.074 --> 01:08:15.034
I followed you from the consulate.

880
01:08:15.354 --> 01:08:16.434
You followed me?

881
01:08:16.714 --> 01:08:20.754
Well, I needed some pork chops
and a toilet brush, too.

882
01:08:22.754 --> 01:08:24.594
I wanted to apologize...

883
01:08:24.914 --> 01:08:27.754
...for the other day,
if we frightened you.

884
01:08:28.114 --> 01:08:30.914
I was a bit startled by all those guns.

885
01:08:31.434 --> 01:08:34.274
I'm sorry.
And I wanted to thank you, too.

886
01:08:35.114 --> 01:08:36.594
Thank me for what?

887
01:08:41.435 --> 01:08:43.795
You don't like your boss
very much, do you?

888
01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:48.275
I don't like many things
about my boss and my country.

889
01:08:49.115 --> 01:08:50.955
But I like my job very much.

890
01:08:51.275 --> 01:08:53.395
It keeps me here in Los Angeles.

891
01:08:53.635 --> 01:08:54.795
You like this town?

892
01:08:56.475 --> 01:08:57.635
That's a new one.

893
01:08:58.795 --> 01:09:01.795
- I forgot your first name.
- It's Rika.

894
01:09:02.075 --> 01:09:03.515
Rika Van Haagen-Dazs.

895
01:09:03.835 --> 01:09:06.515
- Ice cream?
- No, Van den Haas. It's Dutch.

896
01:09:06.955 --> 01:09:08.355
That's real pretty.

897
01:09:12.755 --> 01:09:14.235
You got a rabbit at home?

898
01:09:14.475 --> 01:09:15.675
It's mine.

899
01:09:16.075 --> 01:09:17.235
Shop one day at a time?

900
01:09:17.595 --> 01:09:19.036
Good police work, officer.

901
01:09:19.316 --> 01:09:21.156
I get paid for that.

902
01:09:21.436 --> 01:09:23.396
I don't shop for the entire week.

903
01:09:23.596 --> 01:09:24.836
Why not?

904
01:09:25.676 --> 01:09:28.476
I never know what I'll be hungry for.

905
01:09:30.156 --> 01:09:32.516
Wait. Have dinner with me.

906
01:09:33.756 --> 01:09:37.996
I got a nice place on the beach.
A good view from every window.

907
01:09:38.556 --> 01:09:43.596
A beautiful sunset. Come on,
be original. Everyone else says no.

908
01:09:43.916 --> 01:09:46.196
Come to my place. I'm a gourmet cook.

909
01:09:46.476 --> 01:09:47.676
Let go of the basket.

910
01:09:47.876 --> 01:09:48.796
I'll scream.

911
01:09:51.156 --> 01:09:54.356
I'll embarrass you in public.
You'll turn red like that apple.

912
01:09:54.676 --> 01:09:57.037
- Come on with me.
- No, no, please.

913
01:09:57.277 --> 01:10:01.197
Let go of my bag! Look what she's
doing! Somebody call a cop!

914
01:10:02.477 --> 01:10:03.877
What are you doing?

915
01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:06.357
Let's go before someone calls a cop.

916
01:10:06.637 --> 01:10:08.117
You are a cop.

917
01:10:16.877 --> 01:10:19.197
You must be an honest cop.

918
01:10:19.557 --> 01:10:23.557
It ain't much, but it's everything
I said. Look at the view.

919
01:10:26.557 --> 01:10:29.037
I did exaggerate
about one thing, though.

920
01:10:29.237 --> 01:10:32.557
I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.
I can only make chili.

921
01:10:32.878 --> 01:10:35.878
- Like it with crushed Oreos?
- Of course.

922
01:10:36.238 --> 01:10:37.958
A woman after my own heart.

923
01:10:38.558 --> 01:10:40.078
Watch your step.

924
01:10:40.718 --> 01:10:42.078
Sam wants in.

925
01:10:42.398 --> 01:10:46.398
Here, sit down.
Oh, wait a minute. A little filthy.

926
01:10:56.598 --> 01:10:58.878
I have no wine. How about a beer?

927
01:10:59.078 --> 01:11:00.038
That's fine.

928
01:11:00.758 --> 01:11:02.198
She drinks beer.

929
01:11:19.279 --> 01:11:21.599
What's the matter?
You got a dirty glass?

930
01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:25.279
Oh, it's the wedding ring.

931
01:11:26.959 --> 01:11:28.599
I used to be married.

932
01:11:28.839 --> 01:11:29.799
Not any more?

933
01:11:31.799 --> 01:11:33.119
Not any more.

934
01:11:36.799 --> 01:11:38.279
I've got something on the stove.

935
01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:46.119
Rudd's hiding behind
his diplomatic credentials, isn't he?

936
01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.960
Rudd's hiding behind
his diplomatic credentials.

937
01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.280
He's not a very nice guy.

938
01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.320
Whatever he's doing...

939
01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.480
...he shouldn't get away with it.

940
01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.440
How's it hanging, Wyler?

941
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:13.480
- What do you want?
- I hope better than Murtaugh.

942
01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.480
Easy, easy.

943
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Tell me something. Have your brains
ever seen the light of day?

944
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.920
Who are you?
What do you want? I'm a cop!

945
01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.560
No, you were a cop.

946
01:12:25.121 --> 01:12:26.441
Hurry up, honey.

947
01:12:26.681 --> 01:12:30.681
I'm going to take a couple laps
before I go to the station.

948
01:13:24.922 --> 01:13:28.322
Sam, take a hike.
No Stooges tonight. Go on.

949
01:13:50.483 --> 01:13:51.923
Get that beer in here.

950
01:13:52.163 --> 01:13:53.483
Don't worry about it.

951
01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.763
Cavanaugh, are you in or out?

952
01:13:56.163 --> 01:13:57.323
I'm out.

953
01:13:57.683 --> 01:13:59.003
Put some music on.

954
01:14:08.003 --> 01:14:09.363
Who's not accounted for?

955
01:14:09.603 --> 01:14:10.963
Riggs and Murtaugh.

956
01:14:11.203 --> 01:14:14.683
Murtaugh's taking the witness
to a new location.

957
01:14:14.963 --> 01:14:16.963
- And Riggs?
- Hasn't checked in yet.

958
01:14:17.204 --> 01:14:19.284
Get on the radio and find them!

959
01:14:19.524 --> 01:14:23.524
We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.
How many do we have to lose?

960
01:14:23.804 --> 01:14:27.644
Let's worry about the ones
that are alive, all right? Do it.

961
01:14:28.204 --> 01:14:29.524
Sorry, Captain.

962
01:14:36.564 --> 01:14:37.964
Get me Riggs.

963
01:14:45.044 --> 01:14:46.564
I'll get that.

964
01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:49.804
Wrong number.

965
01:15:01.925 --> 01:15:06.725
Thanks to you, I missed my poker game
and I was feeling real lucky.

966
01:15:07.565 --> 01:15:11.725
Okay, so what I see are nice,
conservative tax returns.

967
01:15:12.085 --> 01:15:14.685
Everything by the book,
black and white.

968
01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:18.165
So you just need to play around
in the gray areas...

969
01:15:18.405 --> 01:15:20.245
...if you want to see some bucks.

970
01:15:20.605 --> 01:15:24.045
On your salary, there's not much
to do but you need deductions.

971
01:15:24.245 --> 01:15:25.725
- My boat.
- You can't deduct it.

972
01:15:25.925 --> 01:15:27.325
No, it's the bill of sale.

973
01:15:27.525 --> 01:15:29.165
I know, but you can't do it.

974
01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:32.246
That's it, my boat! Let's go!

975
01:15:32.526 --> 01:15:33.686
To my house.

976
01:15:34.046 --> 01:15:35.486
Because of my boat.

977
01:15:35.726 --> 01:15:37.366
Look at this commercial.

978
01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:40.686
Look at the body on this kid.
She is so hot.

979
01:15:41.046 --> 01:15:45.366
What are you doing? I want to look
at the girl! Why'd you do that?

980
01:15:45.606 --> 01:15:47.446
I didn't hear you say that.

981
01:15:47.726 --> 01:15:49.046
Say what? She's great.

982
01:15:49.286 --> 01:15:51.966
She makes me want to buy rubbers.

983
01:16:01.126 --> 01:16:03.446
Time for the seventh inning stretch.

984
01:16:07.806 --> 01:16:09.647
That's a baseball expression.

985
01:16:09.967 --> 01:16:11.287
I know.

986
01:16:12.127 --> 01:16:14.487
But we're only up to the fourth inning.

987
01:16:19.967 --> 01:16:21.407
Batter up.

988
01:16:30.847 --> 01:16:32.247
Stay in the car.

989
01:16:33.167 --> 01:16:35.167
I'll only be a minute, okay?

990
01:16:36.007 --> 01:16:39.007
Stay in the car? It's cold.
You have no door.

991
01:16:39.287 --> 01:16:42.447
You're the reason there's no door.
Turn on the heat.

992
01:16:45.687 --> 01:16:49.528
Don't touch anything.
Nothing. I mean nothing!

993
01:16:52.528 --> 01:16:56.008
Alba Varden. Why do I know the name?

994
01:16:56.848 --> 01:16:58.848
It's here. It's got to be.

995
01:16:59.528 --> 01:17:03.128
- Another day, another hobby.
- Yeah, another hobby. What's new?

996
01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:10.728
That's the day on my boat.

997
01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:15.048
It's not there. Where is it?

998
01:17:15.728 --> 01:17:17.208
My birthday.

999
01:17:45.889 --> 01:17:47.249
I'll be damned.

1000
01:17:47.609 --> 01:17:50.769
Alba Varden is a ship, not a woman.

1001
01:17:52.169 --> 01:17:54.249
Leo, I told you to stay in the car!

1002
01:17:54.929 --> 01:17:55.688
Shit!

1003
01:19:01.691 --> 01:19:03.131
Nailed them both.

1004
01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:18.172
My car!

1005
01:19:21.172 --> 01:19:22.492
Leo!

1006
01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:24.573
Get up, get dressed.
Get dressed. Come on.

1007
01:20:29.853 --> 01:20:34.094
- I don't understand.
- Just trust me. I got a bad feeling.

1008
01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:43.815
Get in the truck.
The keys are under the front seat.

1009
01:21:44.095 --> 01:21:47.096
When they stop to reload,
run for the truck!

1010
01:21:47.336 --> 01:21:49.616
- What about you?
- I'll be okay.

1011
01:21:49.816 --> 01:21:53.176
I'll meet you in the truck. Go on!
Stay out of the light!

1012
01:22:40.457 --> 01:22:42.017
The master race.

1013
01:23:10.338 --> 01:23:14.058
You shit! Who were those people?

1014
01:23:14.338 --> 01:23:18.298
You tell me. Was it your husband?
What are you doing Saturday?

1015
01:23:29.258 --> 01:23:30.538
It's Sam!

1016
01:23:33.938 --> 01:23:34.738
Head down!

1017
01:23:53.299 --> 01:23:55.459
Come on, Sam!

1018
01:23:56.379 --> 01:23:57.859
Come on, Sam.

1019
01:23:58.219 --> 01:23:59.699
Shake a leg.

1020
01:23:59.899 --> 01:24:00.739
You made it.

1021
01:24:04.619 --> 01:24:06.299
Has he got any holes in him?

1022
01:24:08.299 --> 01:24:10.619
Oh, you clever dog.

1023
01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:20.300
I promised to have you home by 11.

1024
01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:23.820
This is the most incredible first date
I've ever been on.

1025
01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.580
Wait until the second one.

1026
01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:28.900
- No more helicopters, please.
- Okay, I promise.

1027
01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.260
This is a very nice building.

1028
01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:35.260
Any vacancies? I'm between homes.

1029
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.340
You can stay right here.

1030
01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:39.260
I can?

1031
01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:42.100
Yes, there's
a vacant apartment up there.

1032
01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:45.780
I'm kidding.

1033
01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:47.780
You can stay with me.

1034
01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:49.340
Tonight?

1035
01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:53.341
Yes, tonight. And tomorrow night.
And the night after that.

1036
01:24:53.941 --> 01:24:55.061
And after that?

1037
01:24:55.301 --> 01:24:57.101
Don't push your luck.

1038
01:25:04.181 --> 01:25:05.941
I better go.

1039
01:25:07.221 --> 01:25:09.861
Go inside and lock all the doors
and stay there.

1040
01:25:10.141 --> 01:25:12.541
And you're not going to work tomorrow.

1041
01:25:13.021 --> 01:25:15.701
There's better ways of staying
in LA than working there.

1042
01:25:16.381 --> 01:25:18.701
All right. I've just quit.

1043
01:25:43.662 --> 01:25:47.822
I'll just grab a few things...
Hell, I haven't got anything.

1044
01:25:48.182 --> 01:25:49.902
Just bring yourself.

1045
01:25:53.062 --> 01:25:54.582
I better go.

1046
01:26:12.503 --> 01:26:13.703
Go home!

1047
01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:30.103
Go get the girl.

1048
01:26:51.584 --> 01:26:54.864
I would offer you a drink,
but I understand...

1049
01:26:55.184 --> 01:26:56.384
...you're on the wagon.

1050
01:26:56.624 --> 01:26:58.464
That stuff will kill you quick.

1051
01:26:58.944 --> 01:27:01.944
You know so much about me,
who are you?

1052
01:27:06.344 --> 01:27:08.904
I changed the course of your life.

1053
01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:11.464
Four years ago...

1054
01:27:11.744 --> 01:27:13.984
...when you was a narc at Long Beach...

1055
01:27:14.264 --> 01:27:17.584
...you were getting too close,
so we put a contract out on you.

1056
01:27:17.824 --> 01:27:19.664
I handled it myself.

1057
01:27:19.944 --> 01:27:22.665
Drove your car right off the road,
remember?

1058
01:27:23.105 --> 01:27:25.945
But you weren't driving, were you?

1059
01:27:26.265 --> 01:27:28.425
You can't imagine the surprise...

1060
01:27:29.265 --> 01:27:34.105
...when I pulled back a matted mop of
bloody hair to see this woman's face.

1061
01:27:35.985 --> 01:27:37.185
Your wife, right?

1062
01:27:39.745 --> 01:27:41.865
She didn't die straight away.

1063
01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.865
It took a bit of time.

1064
01:27:52.185 --> 01:27:54.465
You don't have much luck
with women, do you?

1065
01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:34.510
She's dead. They killed her.

1066
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:36.110
Where are you?

1067
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:40.590
They killed her. She's dead.
They killed them both.

1068
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:44.470
Slow down. Who are you talking about?
Where are you?

1069
01:30:44.710 --> 01:30:46.550
She's dead, Roger.

1070
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:52.350
Calm down. We'll take care of it.
Where are you?

1071
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:55.550
I'm not a cop tonight. It's personal.

1072
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:59.830
You don't know what happened tonight.
There's more.

1073
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:05.390
I'm going to get those bastards.
I'm going to fuck them. I'm going now.

1074
01:31:06.311 --> 01:31:10.191
We're not going to the stilt house!
We're under orders!

1075
01:31:10.391 --> 01:31:12.671
Then the house will have to come to me.

1076
01:31:12.911 --> 01:31:15.071
They killed them both.

1077
01:31:15.391 --> 01:31:17.951
They got Rika and they got my wife.

1078
01:31:24.111 --> 01:31:25.071
Shit.

1079
01:31:38.711 --> 01:31:39.791
What's the deal?

1080
01:31:40.751 --> 01:31:43.591
You talk to the Feds,
but you don't talk to me.

1081
01:31:43.792 --> 01:31:45.072
That's not fair.

1082
01:31:49.072 --> 01:31:50.592
We trusted you.

1083
01:31:52.672 --> 01:31:54.392
You betrayed us.

1084
01:31:55.952 --> 01:31:56.952
You took our money!

1085
01:32:00.952 --> 01:32:02.072
We want it back now...

1086
01:32:02.312 --> 01:32:04.832
...you slimy little shit.

1087
01:32:06.552 --> 01:32:08.712
Give him more. He likes it.

1088
01:32:42.513 --> 01:32:44.473
Don't try and stop me.

1089
01:32:44.833 --> 01:32:47.473
I've seen that look
in your eyes before.

1090
01:32:48.273 --> 01:32:50.673
They declared war on the police.

1091
01:32:51.753 --> 01:32:53.273
You know about that?

1092
01:32:53.513 --> 01:32:55.833
I heard it on the radio.

1093
01:32:56.513 --> 01:32:58.754
We don't have the authority.

1094
01:32:58.994 --> 01:33:00.154
Cavanaugh...

1095
01:33:00.354 --> 01:33:02.354
...Wyler, Shapiro...

1096
01:33:03.834 --> 01:33:07.794
...Rika, Vicki. How much
fucking authority do you need?

1097
01:33:09.874 --> 01:33:11.274
You got a plan?

1098
01:33:15.714 --> 01:33:18.114
Drive around the front of the house...

1099
01:33:18.514 --> 01:33:20.354
...wait for my signal...

1100
01:33:21.514 --> 01:33:24.034
...and then just go in
and shoot those fuckers.

1101
01:33:24.434 --> 01:33:25.354
They got Leo.

1102
01:33:27.874 --> 01:33:28.954
Be careful.

1103
01:33:36.755 --> 01:33:37.635
Wait.

1104
01:33:37.995 --> 01:33:38.955
What's your signal?

1105
01:33:40.555 --> 01:33:42.475
You'll know when it happens.

1106
01:33:45.355 --> 01:33:47.835
Somehow I think I will know.

1107
01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:36.436
Feel like talking?

1108
01:34:42.436 --> 01:34:43.556
It's the big one!

1109
01:34:48.236 --> 01:34:50.036
Cool it. Watch him.

1110
01:34:50.276 --> 01:34:51.797
Move me away from the windows!

1111
01:36:03.038 --> 01:36:05.359
Riggs, you crazy mother...!

1112
01:36:21.879 --> 01:36:23.559
Holy Christ!

1113
01:36:27.879 --> 01:36:30.239
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1114
01:36:30.479 --> 01:36:31.639
Thanks.

1115
01:36:32.679 --> 01:36:34.839
- Was Adolf in there?
- He got away.

1116
01:36:35.879 --> 01:36:37.879
- I'm going to find him.
- What about Leo?

1117
01:36:38.079 --> 01:36:39.359
What about Leo?

1118
01:36:39.559 --> 01:36:41.399
You're on your own now.

1119
01:36:41.679 --> 01:36:43.000
What do you mean?

1120
01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:46.680
Take my car to the police station
and wait for the Federal Marshal.

1121
01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.920
It's been an experience knowing you.

1122
01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.600
- I don't want a hug.
- Go on. Lucky if you see him again.

1123
01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:58.520
I had a lot of fun.

1124
01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.920
You do your duty now.

1125
01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.040
I'm going to really get them now.

1126
01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.040
Listen. Wait.

1127
01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:08.280
Is it okay if I sound the siren?

1128
01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.320
Loud as you want.

1129
01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.760
Really? Okay. Really?

1130
01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:22.121
Check it out.

1131
01:37:22.361 --> 01:37:25.721
Alba Varden is a cargo ship,
not a woman.

1132
01:37:25.961 --> 01:37:29.441
The Port Authority said
that the Alba Varden arrived today...

1133
01:37:29.721 --> 01:37:32.561
...and heads out tomorrow
to South Africa.

1134
01:37:34.801 --> 01:37:36.561
This is the eleventh dock.

1135
01:37:36.801 --> 01:37:39.801
It must be here someplace.
I know I'm right.

1136
01:37:45.001 --> 01:37:45.961
The ship!

1137
01:37:46.241 --> 01:37:47.721
What did I tell you?

1138
01:37:49.321 --> 01:37:52.241
That container there
with three heavy hitters.

1139
01:37:52.481 --> 01:37:53.561
Let's have a look.

1140
01:37:55.321 --> 01:37:57.562
I'll take 2 of them out, you take 1.

1141
01:37:59.362 --> 01:38:03.002
Better yet, you take 2, I take 1.
Pull over to the side.

1142
01:38:50.723 --> 01:38:53.883
- I can't see shit!
- Me, either. What is this shit?

1143
01:38:54.123 --> 01:38:55.523
Got a light?

1144
01:38:57.483 --> 01:38:59.483
It's Rudd's, whatever it is.

1145
01:38:59.723 --> 01:39:01.723
I still can't see shit.

1146
01:39:03.723 --> 01:39:06.883
- You got something?
- I don't know. It's a car.

1147
01:39:12.043 --> 01:39:14.404
Shit! Fort Knox!

1148
01:39:18.004 --> 01:39:19.844
Hell, how much is it?

1149
01:39:21.684 --> 01:39:23.004
Thousands.

1150
01:39:24.684 --> 01:39:26.644
Fucking millions.

1151
01:39:27.004 --> 01:39:29.684
Billions of fucking Donald Trump lotto.

1152
01:39:40.004 --> 01:39:40.884
Look at this.

1153
01:39:41.524 --> 01:39:43.564
These are $1,000 bills!

1154
01:39:45.604 --> 01:39:49.765
With what I'm holding in my hand
I could put all my kids through college.

1155
01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:52.205
Take it.

1156
01:39:59.925 --> 01:40:01.285
Fucking drug money.

1157
01:40:01.525 --> 01:40:03.205
Do something good with it.

1158
01:40:03.445 --> 01:40:05.885
Rudd won't need it where he's going.

1159
01:40:18.565 --> 01:40:20.285
Load the container.

1160
01:40:20.565 --> 01:40:24.205
The next time the sun hits
their bodies, they'll be in Cape Town.

1161
01:40:28.406 --> 01:40:31.086
- Hey, this thing's moving.
- It sure as hell is.

1162
01:40:31.486 --> 01:40:33.966
- What are we gonna do now?
- I don't know.

1163
01:40:34.646 --> 01:40:36.206
Let's shoot our way out.

1164
01:40:36.406 --> 01:40:38.486
No, don't. I got a better idea.

1165
01:41:32.887 --> 01:41:34.207
Our money.

1166
01:41:37.487 --> 01:41:39.447
Make sure they're dead.

1167
01:41:50.488 --> 01:41:54.328
- You go first. I'm too old.
- You go first. I'll cover you.

1168
01:42:09.488 --> 01:42:11.688
- How do we get out of here?
- I'll go this way.

1169
01:42:11.928 --> 01:42:14.248
I'll go this way and check over here.

1170
01:43:38.811 --> 01:43:40.131
Oh, shit!

1171
01:45:49.254 --> 01:45:51.094
Riggs, you okay?

1172
01:46:07.935 --> 01:46:09.095
Drop it, asshole!

1173
01:46:15.215 --> 01:46:17.735
Diplomatic immunity!

1174
01:46:28.055 --> 01:46:30.415
It's just been revoked.

1175
01:47:48.377 --> 01:47:51.057
You're breathing. You're not dead.

1176
01:47:51.817 --> 01:47:53.377
No, don't die.

1177
01:47:54.777 --> 01:47:56.738
You're not dead until I tell you.

1178
01:47:57.578 --> 01:48:01.578
You got that, Riggs?
You're not dead until I tell you.

1179
01:48:01.818 --> 01:48:03.338
You got that?

1180
01:48:03.738 --> 01:48:06.218
You' re not dead until I tell you.

1181
01:48:06.738 --> 01:48:08.738
Now, breathe with me.

1182
01:48:09.018 --> 01:48:10.338
Breathe.

1183
01:48:15.738 --> 01:48:17.738
Rog, in my pocket.

1184
01:48:25.938 --> 01:48:30.578
I want you to throw those things away.
Those things will kill you.

1185
01:48:37.859 --> 01:48:39.619
You son-of-a-bitch.

1186
01:48:41.259 --> 01:48:42.699
I thought you were dying.

1187
01:48:42.939 --> 01:48:46.419
I didn't die on your toilet,
I'm not going to die in your arms.

1188
01:48:46.619 --> 01:48:48.259
You son-of-a-bitch.

1189
01:48:53.139 --> 01:48:56.699
Where are they? Are they all gone?
Did you get the bad guys?

1190
01:48:56.939 --> 01:48:59.219
They been dekaffirnated.

1191
01:49:08.059 --> 01:49:10.580
Don't make me laugh! Jesus!

1192
01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:15.580
Did anyone ever tell you...

1193
01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:20.020
...you really are a beautiful man?

1194
01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:26.660
Give us a kiss.

1195
01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:30.500
Where'd that bullet hit you?
