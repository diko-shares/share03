00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.208
I got the strangler! Wabash and Van buren!

2
00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:12.000
Oh, shit.

3
00:01:17.792 --> 00:01:18.833
Oh, shit!

4
00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:20.458
Jack, get the Van.

5
00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:22.708
Eddie, help me!

6
00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:26.167
Eddie, Eddie, don't leave me! God, no!

7
00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:45.667
Give it up, ray! It's over!

8
00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:09.625
Oh, god, I'm dying.

9
00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:15.917
You hear this, you son of a bitch!

10
00:03:17.917 --> 00:03:19.667
I'm gonna get you for it!

11
00:03:22.208 --> 00:03:24.125
I'm gonna get you

12
00:03:24.292 --> 00:03:26.125
and I'm gonna get Eddie

13
00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:29.083
no matter what!

14
00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:44.917
I gotta find somebody.

15
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.208
I gotta find somebody.

16
00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:55.708
I gotta find somebody.

17
00:03:57.417 --> 00:03:59.000
I gotta find somebody.

18
00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:42.625
Give me the power, I beg of you!

19
00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:28.667
[Have no friends.
No one will play with me.

20
00:06:29.292 --> 00:06:32.167
Uh-oh. There's a friend in need.

21
00:06:33.417 --> 00:06:35.042
Hey, cheer up.

22
00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:37.708
- Who are you?
- I'm a good guy.

23
00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:40.208
I've just come from
the good guy clubhouse,

24
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.208
and I'll be your friend to the end.

25
00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:46.500
You will?
You mean you'll be my friend now?

26
00:06:47.083 --> 00:06:48.542
Sure, I will.

27
00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:51.583
Hidey-ho.

28
00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:54.000
I saw this one.

29
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.417
I hidey, hidey, ho j“

30
00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:01.250
j“ best friends till the end I

31
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.708
All right, good guys,
that's our "good guy show" for today,

32
00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:19.083
but don't go away,

33
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.250
because we've got a very important
good guy message

34
00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:24.083
just for you.

35
00:07:26.208 --> 00:07:29.958
Hi, good guys.
Boy, have I got news for you.

36
00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:33.750
Now you can have your very own
good guy doll.

37
00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:36.208
That's right.
You can have all the adventures

38
00:07:36.375 --> 00:07:39.375
we have on TV in your very own home.

39
00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.708
Good guys say three different sentences.

40
00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:46.542
We even turn our heads and
blink our eyes when you talk to us.

41
00:07:46.708 --> 00:07:47.958
Right, Oscar?

42
00:07:48.792 --> 00:07:51.583
Hi, I'm Oscar,
and I'm your friend to the end.

43
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.833
Hidey-ho!

44
00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:56.167
Wow!

45
00:07:56.667 --> 00:07:59.458
Every good guy
has a name all his own

46
00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:02.958
so he can be your very own best friend.

47
00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:06.500
So remember to tell mom and dad
you want a good guy.

48
00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:10.292
Perfect for birthdays
or just any old time.

49
00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:13.333
And remember, you can buy

50
00:08:13.583 --> 00:08:16.667
all of our good guy accessories, too.

51
00:08:16.833 --> 00:08:18.500
- Right, Oscar?
- Right.

52
00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.250
Brought to you exclusively
by play pals

53
00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:25.333
makers of good guys and other fine toys.

54
00:08:26.042 --> 00:08:29.250
Found in toy stores
throughout the greater Chicago area.

55
00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.478
I hidey, hidey, ho j“

56
00:08:33.542 --> 00:08:35.167
mommy, wake up!

57
00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:39.375
Mommy!

58
00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:44.875
Mommy, wake up!

59
00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:51.083
Mommy, wake up!

60
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.375
- Wake up, mommy, wake up!
- Andy!

61
00:08:57.708 --> 00:09:00.708
- What time is it, Andy?
- Wake up.

62
00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:03.042
6:30. It's only 6:30 in the morning.

63
00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:07.333
0h!

64
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.167
But it's a beautiful day outside. See?

65
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.167
It certainly is.
How long you been up, birthday boy?

66
00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:18.667
Since forever.

67
00:09:18.833 --> 00:09:21.792
I made you breakfast in bed.

68
00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.083
You did? Oh, god.

69
00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:26.458
Well, thanks.

70
00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.875
Well, this looks just excellent.

71
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.500
Um...

72
00:09:32.417 --> 00:09:33.708
I'll tell you what.

73
00:09:34.417 --> 00:09:36.750
Why don't I eat this
just a little later, okay?

74
00:09:36.917 --> 00:09:38.083
Mm-hmm.

75
00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:43.042
But first, I gotta give you
your super-duper birthday tummy-gummy.

76
00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.750
Come here. Come here. Come here.

77
00:09:45.917 --> 00:09:48.000
Come here.

78
00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:51.333
That's one. How many years
old are you today? Two?

79
00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.417
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

80
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.875
Thanks. Can we open
my presents now, mommy?

81
00:09:58.042 --> 00:10:01.000
- Yes, we can.
- Terrific!

82
00:10:02.542 --> 00:10:05.167
Good morning, Chicago.
Leading off at this hour

83
00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:07.917
Charles Lee ray,
the notorious Lake Shore strangler,

84
00:10:08.083 --> 00:10:12.292
was shot and killed shortly before three
am this morning on wabash Avenue.

85
00:10:12.542 --> 00:10:15.500
Can I open this first, mommy?
Can I? Can I?

86
00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:18.073
Andy, don't you want to start
with the smaller one first?

87
00:10:20.292 --> 00:10:22.500
Okay, go ahead.

88
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.000
Well, what do you think?
You need these clothes so badly.

89
00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:33.726
Hey, I think they're gonna be okay.

90
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.000
We'll just have to take them up
just a couple inches.

91
00:10:39.292 --> 00:10:41.750
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

92
00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:45.208
Oh, I know. You want some toys, don't you?

93
00:10:45.375 --> 00:10:47.042
Not boring old clothes.

94
00:10:49.042 --> 00:10:50.292
Try the other one.

95
00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:56.625
Well? What do you think?

96
00:10:56.833 --> 00:10:59.000
I want a good guy to go with it.

97
00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:01.875
I know you do, Andy,
but I didn't know about it

98
00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:03.792
in time this month to save up for it.

99
00:11:13.542 --> 00:11:14.833
- Karen.

100
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.720
You know that doll you wanted
for Andy? The one that costs 100 bucks.

101
00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:19.643
- Yeah, the good guy doll.
- There's a peddler in the alley

102
00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:21.875
behind the store and I think he's got one.

103
00:11:22.042 --> 00:11:23.518
What? What would a peddler be doing
with a doll?

104
00:11:23.542 --> 00:11:26.059
Who cares? Would you grab your purse
and come on? We can get a deal on it.

105
00:11:26.083 --> 00:11:28.393
- But I can't just leave my counter.
- Do you want the damn doll or don't you?

106
00:11:28.417 --> 00:11:30.083
- Of course I do.
- Well then come on.

107
00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:31.750
- Come on!
- All right!

108
00:11:35.042 --> 00:11:36.417
There he is.

109
00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:41.833
Okay, show her.

110
00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:47.083
Well, is it a good guy or not?

111
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.750
It is. It is!

112
00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:52.562
- Yeah, well, I told you.
- Oh, uh, how much do you want for it?

113
00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:54.583
- 50 bucks.
- 10 and not a penny more.

114
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.083
- 30.
- What, are you kidding?

115
00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.875
That thing is not worth 30 dollars.

116
00:11:58.042 --> 00:12:00.018
Hey, look. Take it or leave it.
Somebody else will buy it.

117
00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:02.122
- I'll take it.
- Karen, it's too much money.

118
00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:04.143
No, it isn't. You have no idea
how much Andy wants this doll.

119
00:12:04.167 --> 00:12:06.007
But we don't even know
if the damn thing works.

120
00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:07.333
Here you go, lady.

121
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.976
May it bring you and your kid
a lot of joy.

122
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.042
Thank you.

123
00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:11.833
Hey! Hold on, you!

124
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.667
How do we know the damn thing
isn't stolen, huh?

125
00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:17.792
- Steal this!
- Ah, steal this yourself.

126
00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.375
- Maggie.
- I think I dated him.

127
00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:22.583
Come on. We gotta get back to work.

128
00:12:25.875 --> 00:12:27.555
Maggie,
I don't know how you do it.

129
00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:29.542
Andy's going to love it!

130
00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:32.625
Mrs. Barclay, so nice of you to drop by.
Have a nice break?

131
00:12:32.792 --> 00:12:34.226
I'm sorry, Mr. Criswell.
I was only gone for a minute.

132
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.417
Have a heart, criswell.

133
00:12:35.583 --> 00:12:37.943
We were downstairs buying her little boy
a birthday present.

134
00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:41.125
We have specified break times
for activities like that, miss Peterson.

135
00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:43.833
Mrs. Howe has taken sick
and we're shorthanded tonight.

136
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.292
You'll have to fill in for her.

137
00:12:45.583 --> 00:12:48.263
I can't. I have to pick up my son
at the day care center in an hour.

138
00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:51.018
- I'm sorry, this is an emergency.
- Wait a second, I'll take over for her.

139
00:12:51.042 --> 00:12:54.875
Miss Peterson, you work in shoes,
not in jewelry.

140
00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:56.542
You'll just simply have to do it.

141
00:12:56.708 --> 00:12:59.625
Now, you can take off at five
but you'll have to be back at seven.

142
00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:01.417
It's my son's birthday.

143
00:13:01.708 --> 00:13:04.042
Mrs. Barclay,
are you happy with your job here?

144
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.500
Yes, of course I am.

145
00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:07.458
- Then I suggest that...
- Hey.

146
00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:10.125
Chill out, would you, Walter? Huh?

147
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.476
- I'll take care of Andy for you.
- Oh, Maggie, you can't do it again.

148
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.375
Don't be silly. It'll be
the hottest date I've had in months.

149
00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:18.375
I can't imagine why.

150
00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:31.250
- Hey, where are you going?
- Good guys are on TV.

151
00:13:31.417 --> 00:13:33.375
Well, I may have something better for you.

152
00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:35.292
What?

153
00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:38.875
This isn't groceries.

154
00:13:52.625 --> 00:13:55.542
A good guy! I knew it!

155
00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:57.542
I knew you'd get me one!

156
00:13:57.833 --> 00:13:59.125
Show me how he works, okay?

157
00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:04.292
Hi, I'm Andy. What's your name?

158
00:14:04.875 --> 00:14:08.292
Hi, I'm Chucky,
and I'm your friend to the end.

159
00:14:08.625 --> 00:14:11.000
Hidey-ho.

160
00:14:11.708 --> 00:14:14.083
Wow! He's something, isn't he?

161
00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:16.750
Oh, mom, thanks.

162
00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:20.292
You're welcome, honey.

163
00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:42.375
See, that's how you build things.

164
00:14:42.542 --> 00:14:44.226
Wdol with a late-breaking report.

165
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.208
Eddie caputo, reputed
accomplice of Charles Lee ray,

166
00:14:47.375 --> 00:14:49.292
has just escaped
the Michigan Avenue precinct.

167
00:14:49.458 --> 00:14:52.250
More details to follow
on the news at nine next.

168
00:14:56.292 --> 00:14:59.792
Hey, Chucky, you're not watching me.

169
00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:04.208
Hey, want to play?

170
00:15:04.375 --> 00:15:06.250
Hey, it's time for bed, Andy.

171
00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:12.958
Come on, Chucky. We have to
get ready to go to bed.

172
00:15:22.292 --> 00:15:25.542
Aunt Maggie, Chucky wants to watch

173
00:15:25.708 --> 00:15:28.792
the nine o'clock news.

174
00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.333
Sure he does.

175
00:15:33.417 --> 00:15:35.375
Okay, kid, off we go.

176
00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:37.708
Come on. There we go.

177
00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:42.750
- Chucky.
- Oh, yes, Chucky.

178
00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:46.500
You too. Off we go.

179
00:15:49.375 --> 00:15:53.667
Now it's brush your teeth
and under the covers with you.

180
00:15:55.417 --> 00:15:57.500
Okay? Agreed?

181
00:15:57.667 --> 00:15:58.792
Good.

182
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.292
Okay. You yell when you're ready
for me to tuck you in.

183
00:16:05.042 --> 00:16:08.500
Hey, Chucky, want to see my room?

184
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.208
Andy, are you brushing your teeth?

185
00:16:26.375 --> 00:16:28.792
Yes, aunt Maggie!

186
00:16:29.167 --> 00:16:30.458
Good.

187
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.250
And now, action news at nine.

188
00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:44.625
In Washington today,
the mayor replied

189
00:16:44.792 --> 00:16:48.208
that he would study
the congressional findings carefully

190
00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:52.667
and have the commission on gang-related
violence issue recommendations to him.

191
00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:54.375
Back to you, Steve.

192
00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:56.375
Thank you, Terry.

193
00:16:56.542 --> 00:16:58.875
In other news,
police have now clarified the information

194
00:16:59.042 --> 00:17:01.208
regarding the escape of Eddie caputo.

195
00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:03.518
Authorities say that
caputo managed to elude his captors

196
00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:06.750
while being transferred onto
a prison bus on his way to court.

197
00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:18.208
Okay, mister, what do you
have to say about this, huh?

198
00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:21.292
- About what?
- Come on. Come on.

199
00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:27.167
You know, you have to learn
that when I say something, I mean it.

200
00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:30.667
- But what did I do?
- You know what I'm talking about.

201
00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:33.250
Turning the TV on
and putting Chucky in front of it

202
00:17:33.417 --> 00:17:35.833
when I told you it was time to go to bed.

203
00:17:36.083 --> 00:17:38.417
- I didn't do that.
- Oh, no? What did Chucky do?

204
00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:41.333
Walk into the living room
and turn it on all by himself?

205
00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:43.500
Did you do that, Chucky?

206
00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:46.292
Andy, stop it!
Now, come on, under the covers! Hurry.

207
00:17:47.875 --> 00:17:51.792
- But aunt...
- Under the covers and not another word.

208
00:17:52.042 --> 00:17:55.333
But I didn't put Chucky
in front of the TV.

209
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.667
Shh. Enough. Okay?

210
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.083
Give me a kiss.

211
00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.375
Good night, baby, and happy birthday.

212
00:18:03.542 --> 00:18:05.500
Good night, aunt Maggie.

213
00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:26.667
I told you she'd be mad at you
if you watched the news.

214
00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:43.917
Andy?

215
00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:22.125
Andy, is that you?

216
00:21:25.042 --> 00:21:26.208
[Yelpsj

217
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.292
How did that happen?

218
00:22:01.083 --> 00:22:02.125
Uh, hello?

219
00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:04.833
Hi. How's it going? How's Andy?

220
00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:07.625
- Karen?
- Yeah. Who else would it be?

221
00:22:07.792 --> 00:22:08.792
Is something wrong?

222
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.750
Uh. No.

223
00:22:11.917 --> 00:22:13.333
No.

224
00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:15.500
Everything's fine.

225
00:22:16.917 --> 00:22:19.083
Are you sure? You don't sound
like everything's fine.

226
00:22:19.375 --> 00:22:23.542
No. I just had a bit of
the alone-at-night willies, you know?

227
00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:26.000
Now, would you stop worrying and...

228
00:22:26.833 --> 00:22:29.417
Give criswell
a kick in the pants for me, huh?

229
00:22:29.667 --> 00:22:31.708
You got it.

230
00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:35.250
Hey, listen, Maggie. Thank you for
everything. You're a real pal.

231
00:22:36.417 --> 00:22:37.500
Oh, yeah?

232
00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:39.667
Yeah, yeah.
Give Andy a kiss for me, will ya?

233
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.917
See you soon. Bye.

234
00:23:20.458 --> 00:23:22.583
What is wrong with me?

235
00:23:23.042 --> 00:23:24.958
I'm scaring myself half to death.

236
00:23:55.542 --> 00:23:57.292
Get away from this barricade.

237
00:23:57.458 --> 00:24:00.375
Come on. Move it back.
There's nothing to see.

238
00:24:00.542 --> 00:24:04.500
Now let's move this police line back.
Go on home, folks, please.

239
00:24:15.708 --> 00:24:17.333
She was on the sixth floor.

240
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.018
Whoa, miss! Miss! Wait, whoa, whoa!
What do you think you're doing?

241
00:24:31.042 --> 00:24:32.333
I live here.

242
00:24:38.833 --> 00:24:40.000
Andy?

243
00:24:41.667 --> 00:24:43.958
Oh no. Andy?

244
00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:46.625
Andy?

245
00:24:47.333 --> 00:24:48.708
Andy!

246
00:24:48.875 --> 00:24:49.917
Mommy!

247
00:24:50.542 --> 00:24:52.375
Oh, thank god.

248
00:24:53.375 --> 00:24:54.500
Are you all right?

249
00:24:55.375 --> 00:24:57.292
I'm so glad. I got so scared when I...

250
00:24:58.042 --> 00:24:59.792
What's wrong? Where's Maggie?

251
00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:04.583
- She had an accident.
- Accident? What kind of an accident?

252
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.708
Mrs. Barclay,
I'm detective Mike Norris, homicide.

253
00:25:07.875 --> 00:25:09.583
Could I talk to you out in the hall?

254
00:25:10.083 --> 00:25:12.250
- Why? What's happened to Maggie?
- Please.

255
00:25:15.042 --> 00:25:16.333
I'll be right back.

256
00:25:25.125 --> 00:25:26.875
Look, Mrs. Barclay...

257
00:25:34.167 --> 00:25:35.292
What?

258
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.458
- Miss Peterson's dead, Mrs. Barclay.
- What?

259
00:25:41.917 --> 00:25:44.208
- How?
- She fell from your kitchen window.

260
00:25:45.208 --> 00:25:47.458
- No!
- Whoa.

261
00:25:49.208 --> 00:25:50.292
You all right?

262
00:25:51.875 --> 00:25:53.083
- Yes.
- All right.

263
00:25:53.583 --> 00:25:54.875
Come on.

264
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.625
Oh, Maggie.

265
00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:08.167
Oh, Maggie. Oh.

266
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.792
Do you got any idea what these are?

267
00:26:21.458 --> 00:26:24.250
They look like footprints,
don't they? Very small footprints.

268
00:26:26.167 --> 00:26:27.167
What are you implying?

269
00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:29.667
I don't know.

270
00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:32.018
What would Andy be doing
up on the counter, right?

271
00:26:32.042 --> 00:26:34.000
- What?
- Besides, I already checked his closet.

272
00:26:34.167 --> 00:26:35.833
None of his shoes matched these prints.

273
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.167
Mommy?

274
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.583
Mommy?

275
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.625
Chucky wanted to know what was going on.

276
00:26:42.792 --> 00:26:45.268
Andy, I want you to go to bed.
The detective and I are very busy.

277
00:26:45.292 --> 00:26:48.250
- But mom...
- Right now, please.

278
00:26:50.042 --> 00:26:51.333
Andy?

279
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.417
What do you got on your feet?

280
00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:56.875
Good guy pj sneakers.

281
00:26:57.333 --> 00:26:59.958
Wow. Come here.

282
00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:04.625
- Can I see the bottoms of them?
- Sure.

283
00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:09.167
Ooh, look at this, huh?
There's a gun. Is that a cowboy hat?

284
00:27:09.333 --> 00:27:12.542
Andy, get into bed.
I'll be in in a minute to tuck you in.

285
00:27:12.708 --> 00:27:14.417
- But mom...
- Right now!

286
00:27:20.042 --> 00:27:21.792
Why are you treating Andy like this?

287
00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:24.918
If he says he doesn't know how those
footprints got there, then he doesn't.

288
00:27:25.708 --> 00:27:28.628
Look, Mrs. Barclay, somebody made those
footprints. If not Andy, then who?

289
00:27:28.792 --> 00:27:30.375
I don't know and I don't care.

290
00:27:30.833 --> 00:27:33.684
All I know is that I've just lost my best
friend tonight to a horrible accident

291
00:27:33.708 --> 00:27:35.309
and I would like some time alone
with my son,

292
00:27:35.333 --> 00:27:37.667
who I'm sure is just as upset
about this as I am.

293
00:27:37.833 --> 00:27:39.292
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

294
00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:42.708
Um, I'll clear everybody out of here
right away. Okay?

295
00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:45.417
Hey, guys, you done? Huh? Let's go.

296
00:27:45.792 --> 00:27:48.083
Chop, chop. Let's go, everybody.
Out of here!

297
00:27:58.792 --> 00:28:03.750
What do you think was so important
about my sneakers, Chucky?

298
00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:06.958
You don't know either, do you?

299
00:28:27.833 --> 00:28:30.208
Let me know if you find out
anything about those footprints.

300
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.708
Mommy! Mommy!

301
00:28:31.875 --> 00:28:34.250
Mommy, I know who was
on the kitchen counter.

302
00:28:34.417 --> 00:28:36.375
- Andy! I thought I told...
- Who, Andy? Who?

303
00:28:37.042 --> 00:28:38.042
Chucky!

304
00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:39.625
Yourdoh?

305
00:28:41.125 --> 00:28:44.500
Andy, that's enough stories for tonight.
Now, come on, back to bed. I mean it!

306
00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:46.792
But mom...

307
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.333
Good night, detective.

308
00:28:56.083 --> 00:28:57.917
- What?
- Are you going to call me?

309
00:28:58.083 --> 00:29:01.958
- You don't give up, do you?
- I just... I hate loose ends.

310
00:29:02.125 --> 00:29:03.925
And I hate people
who don't know when to stop.

311
00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:05.625
Oof.

312
00:29:05.792 --> 00:29:08.875
- Ouch. A spirited lady.
- No kidding.

313
00:29:09.542 --> 00:29:12.250
I want that autopsy report
on my desk first thing tomorrow.

314
00:29:12.458 --> 00:29:13.934
- Yeah.
- And anything you can find out

315
00:29:13.958 --> 00:29:15.417
about Mrs. Barclay and her son.

316
00:29:15.583 --> 00:29:18.208
You got it! Anything else
I can do for you, sir?

317
00:29:18.375 --> 00:29:21.667
Oh, yeah. Here. Get this to the lab.

318
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.875
I found it in the corner of the kitchen.

319
00:29:24.042 --> 00:29:26.250
- What is this?
- Possible murder weapon.

320
00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:30.250
Come on. You're kidding me.

321
00:29:31.917 --> 00:29:34.125
Hey, you are kidding me, aren't you?

322
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.583
Andy, who are you talking to?

323
00:30:05.208 --> 00:30:06.833
Chucky.

324
00:30:18.208 --> 00:30:19.208
Chucky, huh?

325
00:30:19.917 --> 00:30:21.833
Yeah, sure, Chucky.

326
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.333
He's sitting right over there.

327
00:30:27.583 --> 00:30:29.500
Chucky's been talking to you too,
hasn't he?

328
00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:34.083
- What's he been saying?
- All kinds of things.

329
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.708
His real name is Charles Lee ray

330
00:30:37.875 --> 00:30:41.583
and he's been sent down
from heaven by daddy

331
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.417
to play with me.

332
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.917
He has, has he? Anything else?

333
00:30:51.083 --> 00:30:54.667
Yes. He said aunt Maggie was a real bitch

334
00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:57.167
and got what she deserved.

335
00:30:57.625 --> 00:31:01.125
Andy, how can you say
something so horrible?

336
00:31:01.375 --> 00:31:03.542
I didn't say it. Chucky did.

337
00:31:03.708 --> 00:31:07.875
Andy, stop it. You know perfectly well
that you're making this up!

338
00:31:08.667 --> 00:31:11.833
But I'm not. Chucky's alive.
Really, he is.

339
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.875
Andy. Chucky. Chucky's a doll.

340
00:31:15.208 --> 00:31:17.375
He's made of plastic and stuffing.

341
00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:20.625
Look at him. Look at him.
Does he look like anything else to you?

342
00:31:20.792 --> 00:31:22.708
- Huh?
- Don't, you'll hurt him.

343
00:31:22.875 --> 00:31:24.208
Andy, look!

344
00:31:25.208 --> 00:31:27.917
Now, you don't really think
that Chucky is alive, do you?

345
00:31:28.542 --> 00:31:29.792
But he is.

346
00:31:29.958 --> 00:31:32.708
Andy, stop it! Please!

347
00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:38.167
It's 'cause of aunt Maggie
you're yelling at me, isn't it?

348
00:31:41.292 --> 00:31:44.750
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.

349
00:31:45.208 --> 00:31:46.875
I'm sorry.

350
00:31:47.042 --> 00:31:49.833
I'll stop making up stories.

351
00:31:55.042 --> 00:31:56.583
Thanks, champ.

352
00:31:58.375 --> 00:31:59.975
Do you want to sleep in with me tonight?

353
00:32:00.542 --> 00:32:02.083
No, it's all right.

354
00:32:02.667 --> 00:32:04.875
I've got Chucky.

355
00:32:08.708 --> 00:32:09.833
Come on, into bed.

356
00:32:15.708 --> 00:32:17.125
Good night, sweetheart.

357
00:32:19.583 --> 00:32:20.625
I love you.

358
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.583
Bye-bye.

359
00:32:37.542 --> 00:32:41.917
You're right, Chucky.
She didn't believe me.

360
00:32:48.625 --> 00:32:50.833
Hi. I like to be hugged.

361
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.125
Good. I'd love to hug you too.

362
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.250
Hey.

363
00:33:11.167 --> 00:33:12.917
You sure you're all right
about last night?

364
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.500
No bad dreams about aunt Maggie?

365
00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:18.833
And Chucky's only a doll, right?

366
00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:23.333
All right, off to school with you, then.
I love you tons.

367
00:34:39.375 --> 00:34:42.625
43rd street. Next stop, 47th.

368
00:35:34.583 --> 00:35:36.417
Is that Eddie's?

369
00:35:40.417 --> 00:35:44.625
Look, you stay here. I have to go tinkle.

370
00:35:55.542 --> 00:35:57.792
I'll be right there, Chucky!

371
00:37:12.875 --> 00:37:14.667
Chucky?

372
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.375
Chucky?

373
00:38:08.708 --> 00:38:10.500
Chucky?

374
00:38:16.333 --> 00:38:18.125
Chucky?

375
00:38:18.583 --> 00:38:20.083
Chucky?

376
00:38:20.875 --> 00:38:22.250
Chucky?

377
00:38:36.125 --> 00:38:37.375
Chucky?

378
00:38:41.875 --> 00:38:43.333
Chucky?

379
00:39:06.792 --> 00:39:09.000
- Mrs. Barclay?
- Oh, detective Norris.

380
00:39:09.167 --> 00:39:10.708
I came as soon as I got your message.

381
00:39:11.208 --> 00:39:12.893
You haven't been to school
to pick up your son yet?

382
00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:17.083
- No. No, I came directly from work. Why?
- Let's go into my office.

383
00:39:18.208 --> 00:39:20.208
- Is something wrong with Andy?
- Please.

384
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.500
I, uh...

385
00:39:28.708 --> 00:39:30.588
I don't know how to tell you this,
Mrs. Barclay.

386
00:39:30.917 --> 00:39:32.000
Tell me what?

387
00:39:32.417 --> 00:39:35.875
Do you have any idea why your
aunt Maggie fell out of that window?

388
00:39:36.042 --> 00:39:38.417
- Yes.
- Could you tell me why?

389
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:44.375
'Cause she saw Chucky and
it scared her so much, she fell out.

390
00:39:44.542 --> 00:39:45.792
Oh, she did, huh?

391
00:39:46.792 --> 00:39:49.000
So why did Chucky go to see Eddie caputo?

392
00:39:49.708 --> 00:39:52.458
- Mommy!
- Oh, Andy!

393
00:39:57.083 --> 00:39:58.917
All right, sweetheart. Come on.

394
00:40:01.208 --> 00:40:03.000
Now listen to me, okay?

395
00:40:04.375 --> 00:40:07.000
Nobody believes you about Chucky.

396
00:40:07.875 --> 00:40:11.000
Unless you start telling the truth
right now...

397
00:40:12.208 --> 00:40:14.292
They're going to take you away from me.

398
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.042
You hear that, Chucky?

399
00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:22.458
They're taking me away
unless you say something.

400
00:40:25.167 --> 00:40:27.417
Please, say something.

401
00:40:28.708 --> 00:40:31.167
Come on, Chucky! Say something!

402
00:40:31.333 --> 00:40:35.000
Tell me why you lied to me
about everything.

403
00:40:35.167 --> 00:40:38.250
Come on, Chucky! Say something!

404
00:40:38.417 --> 00:40:40.042
Tell me!

405
00:40:40.208 --> 00:40:43.750
Hi! I'm Chucky and
I'm your friend to the end.

406
00:40:43.917 --> 00:40:45.833
Hidey-ho.

407
00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:50.000
Mommy, he's doing it on purpose!

408
00:40:50.167 --> 00:40:54.333
He told me never to tell about him
or he'd kill me.

409
00:40:54.542 --> 00:40:56.976
Mrs. Barclay, my name is doctor ardmore.

410
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.292
I'm from county general.

411
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.792
I've seen more than enough.

412
00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:03.417
Maybe Andy should spend
a couple of days with us.

413
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.625
Well, say something, you little... bastard.

414
00:41:47.833 --> 00:41:49.583
Say something, damn it!

415
00:41:50.833 --> 00:41:53.208
Hi. I like to be hugged.

416
00:42:34.875 --> 00:42:36.833
"He wants you for a best friend."

417
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.917
Yeah, sure.

418
00:43:38.167 --> 00:43:40.417
Hi. I'm Chucky! Want to play?

419
00:44:43.708 --> 00:44:44.917
Talk to me.

420
00:44:46.625 --> 00:44:47.917
Come on, talk!

421
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.792
I said talk to me, damn it! All right!

422
00:44:53.292 --> 00:44:55.000
Then I'm going to make you talk!

423
00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:11.083
I said talk to me, dammit,
or else I'm gonna throw you in the fire!

424
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.333
You stupid bitch! You filthy slut!

425
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.667
I'll teach you to fuck with me!

426
00:45:17.208 --> 00:45:19.500
No!

427
00:45:56.375 --> 00:45:57.750
Stop!

428
00:46:50.542 --> 00:46:51.917
Oh, detective Norris!

429
00:46:52.833 --> 00:46:54.309
Mrs. Barclay,
what are you doing back here?

430
00:46:54.333 --> 00:46:55.458
Andy was telling the truth.

431
00:46:55.833 --> 00:46:57.833
Chucky is alive and
he killed Eddie caputo.

432
00:46:58.542 --> 00:46:59.542
What?

433
00:46:59.708 --> 00:47:00.851
I took him home to my apartment.

434
00:47:00.875 --> 00:47:04.042
I was about to throw away the box that
he came in when the batteries fell out.

435
00:47:04.292 --> 00:47:06.875
Don't you see? He's been moving
and talking for days

436
00:47:07.042 --> 00:47:08.417
without any batteries in him.

437
00:47:08.833 --> 00:47:11.750
- What are you talking about?
- How I found out the doll was alive.

438
00:47:11.917 --> 00:47:14.292
See, I threatened
to throw him into the fireplace

439
00:47:14.458 --> 00:47:16.875
when all of a sudden,
he came alive in my hand.

440
00:47:17.042 --> 00:47:19.375
I dropped him, and he got up and
ran out of the apartment.

441
00:47:20.875 --> 00:47:22.708
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.

442
00:47:22.875 --> 00:47:25.542
Wait a minute! I am telling you the truth!

443
00:47:25.917 --> 00:47:27.351
He killed Maggie, he killed Eddie caputo.

444
00:47:27.375 --> 00:47:31.167
Look, Mrs. Barclay! I sympathize with you.
I really do.

445
00:47:31.333 --> 00:47:34.333
I hated what happened in there today,
but lying is not gonna...

446
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:37.042
Lying? Does this look like I'm lying?

447
00:47:38.792 --> 00:47:40.708
- How did you get those?
- Chucky bit me.

448
00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:43.708
Oh, for god's sake!

449
00:47:43.917 --> 00:47:45.375
All right, don't believe me!

450
00:47:47.458 --> 00:47:49.208
- Where you goin'?
- To find Chucky!

451
00:47:50.042 --> 00:47:51.250
How you gonna do that?

452
00:47:51.417 --> 00:47:53.708
I bought it from a peddler where I work,
I'll start there.

453
00:47:53.875 --> 00:47:56.315
That isn't a good part of town to be in
at this time of night!

454
00:47:56.792 --> 00:47:58.208
Mrs. Barclay, do you hear me?

455
00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:01.375
You don't want to go down there
at this time of night!

456
00:48:05.833 --> 00:48:07.833
Goddamn it!

457
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:08.708
- Nah.
- Mm-mm.

458
00:49:22.583 --> 00:49:24.292
What's she doin' here?

459
00:49:28.542 --> 00:49:30.417
Hey, excuse me.

460
00:49:30.583 --> 00:49:32.000
Mister!

461
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:35.750
Mister!

462
00:49:36.167 --> 00:49:38.083
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Do you remember me?

463
00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:39.458
No, no.

464
00:49:39.625 --> 00:49:41.059
I... I'm sor... I bought a doll from you

465
00:49:41.083 --> 00:49:43.476
in back of Carson's department store
with my friend, yesterday.

466
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.542
- Doll?
- Yes. A good guy doll.

467
00:49:45.708 --> 00:49:48.833
- You sold it to me. Do you remember?
- Oh, yeah, a doll. What about it?

468
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.625
- Where did you get it?
- What will you give me if I tell you?

469
00:49:51.792 --> 00:49:57.458
Well, I don't have much but
you're welcome to whatever I have.

470
00:50:00.417 --> 00:50:02.292
It's not enough. What else you got?

471
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:05.958
- That's all I've got.
- All you got?

472
00:50:06.417 --> 00:50:08.500
- What are you... yes.
- That's not all you got.

473
00:50:09.542 --> 00:50:11.083
- Wait a minute.
- No, you got a lot.

474
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:13.083
No. No, no!

475
00:50:13.417 --> 00:50:17.042
- No! Wait! No! No, no - pig!

476
00:50:18.458 --> 00:50:21.667
- Christ, he's a cop!
- All right, what about the rest of you?

477
00:50:21.833 --> 00:50:23.458
You wanna party too?

478
00:50:30.208 --> 00:50:32.476
All right, now, you want to answer
the lady's question now? Huh?

479
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.500
Where did you get the doll?

480
00:50:34.667 --> 00:50:36.500
I don't know nothin' about no doll.

481
00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:38.143
You're not gonna know nothin'
about nothin' in a minute

482
00:50:38.167 --> 00:50:39.447
unless you talk to me, now talk!

483
00:50:39.542 --> 00:50:42.417
A burned-out toy store on wabash!
That's where I got it.

484
00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:46.500
Get outta here!

485
00:50:48.875 --> 00:50:49.958
What's wrong?

486
00:50:51.875 --> 00:50:53.000
Nothing.

487
00:50:54.875 --> 00:50:57.675
Well, wait a minute. Something the peddler
said upset you. What was it?

488
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:59.167
I just told you, nothing.

489
00:51:00.125 --> 00:51:03.375
Goddamn it! My son's life
is at stake! Now, what was it?

490
00:51:05.208 --> 00:51:08.792
The place where he said he got the doll,
Charles Lee ray died there.

491
00:51:09.042 --> 00:51:10.458
Who?

492
00:51:10.625 --> 00:51:13.792
The Lake Shore strangler. The man who
was partners with Eddie caputo.

493
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.125
- Whoa, hey. Where are you going now?
- Wabash and Van buren.

494
00:51:18.292 --> 00:51:20.434
There's nothing there.
It's an abandoned wreck of a store.

495
00:51:20.458 --> 00:51:21.458
Why don't you believe me?

496
00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:24.167
It was struck by lightning
the night Charles Lee ray died.

497
00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:29.375
- How do you know that?
- Because I was there!

498
00:51:29.542 --> 00:51:31.375
I was the man who killed him!

499
00:51:38.208 --> 00:51:39.250
Why didn't you tell me?

500
00:51:40.833 --> 00:51:44.167
It's not exactly the kind of thing
you tell someone.

501
00:51:44.667 --> 00:51:47.625
Come on. Let me take you home.
You need some sleep.

502
00:51:48.292 --> 00:51:50.292
- Did he say anything? Anything at all?
- Who?

503
00:51:50.458 --> 00:51:51.917
- Charles Lee ray.
- Yeah.

504
00:51:52.083 --> 00:51:54.208
He threatened to kill me and Eddie caputo.

505
00:52:07.542 --> 00:52:09.875
Sorry you couldn't find anything
to help Andy.

506
00:52:10.625 --> 00:52:12.208
I really am.

507
00:52:12.375 --> 00:52:15.833
But I did. I found out
that Chucky is Charles Lee ray.

508
00:52:16.417 --> 00:52:18.708
The only thing I don't know
is how he got inside the doll.

509
00:52:21.167 --> 00:52:23.567
- Good night, Mrs. Barclay.
- Where did Charles Lee ray live?

510
00:52:24.875 --> 00:52:27.208
Look, please, will you
just get out of the car?

511
00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:29.015
Hey, just tell me where he lived.

512
00:52:29.125 --> 00:52:31.708
Don't you understand?
Andy's life depends on it.

513
00:52:32.333 --> 00:52:35.042
730 stoney island, the south side.

514
00:52:35.208 --> 00:52:39.042
But I've already checked the place out.
There's nothing there. Now, good night.

515
00:52:39.208 --> 00:52:40.625
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

516
00:52:42.167 --> 00:52:44.367
- Home. Get some sleep.
- No, you can't do that!

517
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.667
Don't you see? You just said it.

518
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.042
Chucky killed caputo. That leaves you.

519
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:51.667
- That does it.
- Oh, please listen to me.

520
00:52:56.542 --> 00:52:58.708
- Out.
- I am telling you the truth!

521
00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:01.625
- Why won't you believe me?
- Because I'm sane, Mrs. Barclay,

522
00:53:01.792 --> 00:53:02.917
sane and rational.

523
00:53:04.917 --> 00:53:06.833
All right! All right!

524
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.434
Do you remember what you said the
first night you met me in my apartment?

525
00:53:09.458 --> 00:53:11.226
- What about it?
- You said you didn't like loose ends.

526
00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:12.333
Well, I'm a loose end.

527
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.100
You can't just let go what I said tonight
without checking it out.

528
00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:17.458
For the last time,
Mrs. Barclay, good night.

529
00:53:17.625 --> 00:53:19.167
Oh, my...

530
00:54:15.708 --> 00:54:17.458
Good night, asshole.

531
00:55:04.542 --> 00:55:06.833
Oh, god!

532
00:55:13.875 --> 00:55:15.500
Jeez! Look out!

533
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.292
Hi, Mikey!

534
00:56:15.917 --> 00:56:19.458
Won't do 'ya any good,
Mikey! You can't hurt me!

535
00:58:42.042 --> 00:58:43.833
Karen.

536
00:58:47.833 --> 00:58:49.167
What are you doing here?

537
00:58:51.208 --> 00:58:53.000
After I talked to you last night,

538
00:58:53.208 --> 00:58:56.083
I decided to go back to the station
and pull Ray's file.

539
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.292
I learned a couple of things.
His nickname was Chucky.

540
00:59:01.958 --> 00:59:03.833
He spent a lot of time with this man.

541
00:59:10.708 --> 00:59:14.083
Now all we have to do is find him
before Chucky does.

542
00:59:22.833 --> 00:59:24.625
Hello, John.

543
00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.208
Over here!

544
00:59:30.625 --> 00:59:32.042
It's me. Chucky.

545
00:59:32.542 --> 00:59:35.792
What d'ya think? The grigri work?

546
00:59:38.042 --> 00:59:41.792
You know, when I came here learning
all that stuff about how to beat death,

547
00:59:42.125 --> 00:59:44.583
I thought maybe you were pullin' my chain.

548
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:47.500
But not now. Uh-uh, not now.

549
00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:50.583
- Only one problem.
- What?

550
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:54.750
This. I didn't think
anybody could hurt me.

551
00:59:55.125 --> 00:59:56.667
But last night I got shot.

552
00:59:57.875 --> 00:59:59.750
Know somethin'? It hurt.

553
01:00:00.125 --> 01:00:02.667
It hurt like a son of a bitch.
It even bled.

554
01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:04.583
Why's that, John?

555
01:00:05.708 --> 01:00:07.875
- You're turning human.
- What?

556
01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:11.958
The more time you spend in that body...

557
01:00:13.417 --> 01:00:15.042
The more human you become.

558
01:00:16.833 --> 01:00:19.333
You mean I have to live out
the rest of my life in this body?

559
01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:24.500
No fucking way! You got me
into this, you get me out!

560
01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:28.667
- I can't do that, Chucky.
- Why not?

561
01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:31.875
Because you're an abomination!

562
01:00:32.708 --> 01:00:35.417
An outrage against nature!

563
01:00:35.583 --> 01:00:38.000
You've perverted everything
I've taught you

564
01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.875
and used it for evil!

565
01:00:40.042 --> 01:00:41.917
And you have to be stopped!

566
01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:48.583
You know, I thought
something like this might happen.

567
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:51.750
- That's why I prepared for it.
- What are you talking about?

568
01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:54.417
Your own personal mojo, doc.

569
01:00:55.958 --> 01:00:58.417
- Give me that.
- Sure. How do you want it?

570
01:00:58.583 --> 01:00:59.833
Broken leg?

571
01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:06.833
Shouldn't tell your customers
where you hide things like this, John.

572
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.042
Gets you in trouble every time.

573
01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:11.875
Now how do I get out of this body?

574
01:01:12.042 --> 01:01:14.792
- No. I won't tell you.
- Yeah?

575
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:21.208
Tell me or die, John. Your choice.

576
01:01:21.625 --> 01:01:24.042
I'll tell you.

577
01:01:26.042 --> 01:01:29.083
You have to transfer your soul
out of the doll...

578
01:01:29.583 --> 01:01:33.500
Into that of the first human being you
revealed your true self to.

579
01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:37.292
You mean the first person I let in on
the fact that I was really alive?

580
01:01:40.792 --> 01:01:43.458
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

581
01:01:43.625 --> 01:01:47.625
The first person I let in on my little
secret was a six-year-old kid.

582
01:01:47.792 --> 01:01:49.833
I'm gonna be six years old again.

583
01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:54.417
Well, John, it's been fun, but I gotta go.

584
01:01:54.792 --> 01:01:57.583
I have a date with a six-year-old boy.

585
01:01:58.542 --> 01:02:01.667
And you have a date with death.

586
01:02:05.292 --> 01:02:07.333
Solong, John.

587
01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:33.875
Hold it! Wait, wait.

588
01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:43.417
Oh, my god.

589
01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:48.083
- Too late.
- What?

590
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:51.833
Must save the boy. Must...

591
01:02:54.583 --> 01:02:56.542
Must get his soul...

592
01:02:57.292 --> 01:03:00.250
Into him like he got into doll.

593
01:03:00.417 --> 01:03:01.417
What?

594
01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:05.917
You must stop him
before he can say the chant.

595
01:03:06.708 --> 01:03:09.208
Kill him before he can say it.

596
01:03:09.375 --> 01:03:11.333
But how? How?

597
01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:16.417
The heart. His heart is almost human.

598
01:03:18.583 --> 01:03:22.000
It's the only way. Through the heart.

599
01:03:39.708 --> 01:03:43.625
Help me! Help me!
Dr. Ardmore, Chucky's here!

600
01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:55.958
Help me! He's coming to kill me!

601
01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:58.292
He's here! Chucky's here!

602
01:03:58.458 --> 01:04:00.333
I don't see anybody.

603
01:04:01.625 --> 01:04:03.542
But doctor, Chucky's here.

604
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:06.375
And he's going to kill me.

605
01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:14.000
But Chucky is here,
and he's going to kill me!

606
01:04:17.292 --> 01:04:19.458
He's gonna kill me.

607
01:04:19.625 --> 01:04:22.917
Please don't leave me. Please.

608
01:05:19.542 --> 01:05:21.333
Andy! Stop!

609
01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:23.625
Stop him!

610
01:05:37.125 --> 01:05:38.708
Check the north corridor!

611
01:06:24.417 --> 01:06:26.708
Easy, Andy, easy.
It's all right, Andy. It's all right.

612
01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:29.792
You're not gonna need this anymore.
All right?

613
01:06:30.667 --> 01:06:32.542
But I do! Chucky's in the room,

614
01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:34.417
- and he's trying to kill me!
- No, no.

615
01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:38.333
No, Andy. It's gonna be all right.
I'm here now. I'm gonna protect you.

616
01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:41.625
Andy. Easy, boy, easy.

617
01:06:41.917 --> 01:06:43.417
Come on. Nobody's here.

618
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.875
No, please! He'll kill you too.

619
01:06:46.167 --> 01:06:49.625
No. Please listen to me. Please!

620
01:06:49.792 --> 01:06:52.500
Andy, now, this is just gonna sting you
for one second.

621
01:07:07.542 --> 01:07:12.333
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

622
01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:18.208
Stop.

623
01:07:35.333 --> 01:07:36.458
What happened?

624
01:07:36.625 --> 01:07:38.958
Look, uh, miss, could you just excuse us
for a minute here,

625
01:07:39.125 --> 01:07:40.417
- all right?
- What?

626
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:44.250
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

627
01:07:44.417 --> 01:07:47.375
Fried him to a crisp with the electric
shock machine, and then he escaped.

628
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:49.167
Escaped? Where?

629
01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:52.958
We don't know, but I bet she does.

630
01:07:57.917 --> 01:07:59.667
Chucky. You seen Chucky anywhere?

631
01:08:01.167 --> 01:08:02.958
- Who's Chucky?
- Kid's doll.

632
01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:05.925
The same one that was at the station
house. Have you seen him anywhere?

633
01:08:06.042 --> 01:08:08.625
What am I gonna know about a
doll? Where are you goin'?

634
01:08:12.625 --> 01:08:13.625
They think Andy did it.

635
01:08:13.792 --> 01:08:16.958
I know. The girl said that Chucky was here
and that he was looking for Andy.

636
01:08:17.125 --> 01:08:18.958
- Where would Andy go?
- He'd go home.

637
01:08:19.125 --> 01:08:20.518
I always told him to go there
if he was in trouble.

638
01:08:20.542 --> 01:08:21.542
Does he have a key?

639
01:08:21.708 --> 01:08:22.958
- It's under the mat.
- Come on.

640
01:08:23.125 --> 01:08:24.445
Come on. We don't have much time.

641
01:08:50.083 --> 01:08:51.167
Look, George.

642
01:08:51.333 --> 01:08:53.167
Some child left their doll
in the elevator.

643
01:08:53.333 --> 01:08:54.333
Leave it alone.

644
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.667
Whoever left it there
will come back looking for it.

645
01:09:02.417 --> 01:09:04.208
Ugly doll.

646
01:09:06.125 --> 01:09:07.333
Fuck you.

647
01:10:50.917 --> 01:10:52.542
Surprise!

648
01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:25.333
Batter up!

649
01:12:09.208 --> 01:12:12.458
Give me the power, I beg of you.

650
01:12:29.833 --> 01:12:31.250
Andy!

651
01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:37.268
Andy!

652
01:12:37.292 --> 01:12:38.792
- Andy?
- Andy!

653
01:12:38.958 --> 01:12:40.375
Andy, can you hear me?

654
01:12:47.292 --> 01:12:49.052
Andy!

655
01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:51.875
Andy!

656
01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.417
Andy!

657
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.875
Karen. Karen, are you all right?

658
01:13:07.333 --> 01:13:08.458
Just take care of Andy.

659
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:15.542
Karen. Karen.

660
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:18.000
- Take this. Take it.
- Mike!

661
01:13:20.292 --> 01:13:21.875
Mommy.

662
01:14:21.792 --> 01:14:24.042
What's wrong? Gun jammed?

663
01:15:02.625 --> 01:15:06.042
Andy! Andy, help me! The matches!

664
01:15:06.875 --> 01:15:09.250
Andy! Please! Now!

665
01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:24.083
Andy, no, please.

666
01:15:24.583 --> 01:15:26.917
We're friends to the end. Remember?

667
01:15:27.417 --> 01:15:30.792
This is the end, friend.

668
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.583
No!

669
01:16:15.042 --> 01:16:16.583
Oh, my baby.

670
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:18.708
Karen? Andy?

671
01:16:19.042 --> 01:16:20.292
You all right?

672
01:16:25.917 --> 01:16:27.292
Oh!

673
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.167
Andy. Go get me the first-aid kit
under the kitchen sink really fast, okay?

674
01:16:31.667 --> 01:16:35.292
- What happened?
- Oh, god. Chucky's dead.

675
01:16:47.542 --> 01:16:50.542
Mommy, Chucky's gone.

676
01:16:51.333 --> 01:16:53.292
Andy, hurry up.

677
01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.542
Andy?

678
01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:11.375
Hello, Andy.

679
01:17:14.125 --> 01:17:15.667
Mommy.

680
01:17:16.583 --> 01:17:17.792
Mommy.

681
01:17:19.333 --> 01:17:20.583
Mommy!

682
01:17:24.417 --> 01:17:26.542
Give me the boy and I'll let you live!

683
01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:29.542
Do you hear me? Give me the boy!

684
01:17:53.042 --> 01:17:54.208
Mommy!

685
01:18:16.542 --> 01:18:17.542
Oh!

686
01:18:26.625 --> 01:18:28.917
Give me the boy!

687
01:19:38.292 --> 01:19:39.851
What the hell's goin' on here?

688
01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:41.917
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

689
01:19:42.083 --> 01:19:43.125
Karen!

690
01:19:46.125 --> 01:19:47.417
God!

691
01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.958
Oh, Jesus.

692
01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:57.851
Yeah, I got a cop down here,
multiple stab wounds.

693
01:19:57.875 --> 01:20:00.708
At the Brewster apartments
on north grand street. Make it fast.

694
01:20:01.458 --> 01:20:04.309
All right, they're gonna be here
in ten minutes, now tell me what happened.

695
01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:06.833
The kid was right. The doll's alive.

696
01:20:07.208 --> 01:20:09.928
- He almost got the three of us.
- C'mon, what are you talking about?

697
01:20:11.417 --> 01:20:14.792
You don't believe me? All right, well,
go on. Check it out in the hall.

698
01:20:14.958 --> 01:20:19.083
He's scattered all over the place.
But don't touch it. Do you understand me?

699
01:20:19.333 --> 01:20:22.375
- Don't you touch one part of it!
- All right, look. Take it easy, okay?

700
01:20:22.542 --> 01:20:24.333
Just relax yourself, all right? All right.

701
01:21:03.542 --> 01:21:06.125
Okay, Mike. I'd like you to take a look
at this thing, okay?

702
01:21:06.292 --> 01:21:08.375
Because there's no way this thing's alive.

703
01:21:10.167 --> 01:21:13.167
- I thought I told you not to touch it.
- Mike, will you be sensible?

704
01:21:13.333 --> 01:21:15.667
Come on, look. It's as dead as they come.
It's dead!

705
01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:22.125
Kill him! Choke him! Kill him!
Rip his throat out!

706
01:21:22.583 --> 01:21:24.667
Kill him! Kill him!

707
01:21:26.333 --> 01:21:28.000
Kill him!

708
01:21:32.333 --> 01:21:37.458
Kill him now! Strangle him!
Don't let go!

709
01:21:42.708 --> 01:21:43.708
God.

710
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.208
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all!

711
01:21:55.375 --> 01:21:57.500
The heart! Shoot him in the heart!

712
01:22:22.875 --> 01:22:25.250
Hi. I'm Chucky.

713
01:22:25.417 --> 01:22:29.625
Wanna play...

714
01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:42.375
- You believe me now?
- Yeah.

715
01:22:44.875 --> 01:22:46.667
But who's gonna believe me?

716
01:22:51.583 --> 01:22:52.583
Come on.

717
01:22:55.292 --> 01:22:57.500
All right. Ready? Here we go.

718
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.917
Andy. Come on. We're gonna
go to the hospital with Mike.

719
01:23:22.667 --> 01:23:24.125
Let's go.
