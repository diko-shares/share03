You'll have to fill in for her.

174
00:12:45.583 --> 00:12:48.263
I can't. I have to pick up my son
at the day care center in an hour.

175
00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:51.018
- I'm sorry, this is an emergency.
- Wait a second, I'll take over for her.

176
00:12:51.042 --> 00:12:54.865
Miss Peterson, you work in shoes,
not in jewelry.

177
00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:56.532
You'll just simply have to do it.

178
00:12:56.708 --> 00:12:59.621
Now, you can take off at five
but you'll have to be back at seven.

179
00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:01.408
It's my son's birthday.

180
00:13:01.708 --> 00:13:04.040
Mrs. Barclay,
are you happy with your job here?

181
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.500
Yes, of course I am.

182
00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:07.453
- Then I suggest that...
- [Maggie] Hey.

183
00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:10.117
Chill out, would you, Walter? Huh?

184
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.476
- I'll take care of Andy for you.
- Oh, Maggie, you can't do it again.

185
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.367
Don't be silly. It'll be
the hottest date I've had in months.

186
00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:18.374
I can't imagine why.

187
00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:31.246
- Hey, where are you going?
- Good Guys are on TV.

188
00:13:31.417 --> 00:13:33.374
Well, I may have something better for you.

189
00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:35.282

190
00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:38.869

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.617
Chucky wanted to know what was going on.

349
00:26:42.792 --> 00:26:45.268
Andy, I want you to go to bed.
The detective and I are very busy.

350
00:26:45.292 --> 00:26:48.250
- But Mom...
- Right now, please.

351
00:26:50.042 --> 00:26:51.328
[Mike] Andy?

352
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.411
What do you got on your feet?

353
00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:56.874
Good Guy PJ sneakers.

354
00:26:57.333 --> 00:26:59.950
Wow. Come here.

355
00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:04.624
- Can I see the bottoms of them?
- Sure.

356
00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:09.155
[Mike] Ooh, look at this, huh?
There's a gun. Is that a cowboy hat?

357
00:27:09.333 --> 00:27:12.530
Andy, get into bed.
I'll be in in a minute to tuck you in.

358
00:27:12.708 --> 00:27:14.415
- But Mom...
- Right now!

359
00:27:20.042 --> 00:27:21.783
Why are you treating Andy like this?

360
00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:24.918
If he says he doesn't know how those
footprints got there, then he doesn't.

361
00:27:25.708 --> 00:27:28.628
Look, Mrs. Barclay, somebody made those
footprints. If not Andy, then who?

362
00:27:28.792 --> 00:27:30.374
I don't know and I don't care.

363
00:27:30.833 --> 00:27:33.684
All I know is that I've just lost my best
friend tonight to a horrible accident

364
00:27:33.708 --> 00:27:35.309
and I would like some time alone
with my son,

365
00:27:35.333 --> 00:27:37.665
Who I'm sure is just as upset
about this as I am.

366
00:27:37.833 --> 00:27:39.289
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

367
00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:42.700
Um, I'll clear everybody out of here
right away. Okay?

368
00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:45.412
Hey, guys, you done? Huh? Let's go.

369
00:27:45.792 --> 00:27:48.079
Chop, chop. Let's go, everybody.
Out of here!

370
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.786
[indistinct chattering]

371
00:27:49.958 --> 00:27:50.993
[gasping]

372
00:27:58.792 --> 00:28:03.741
What do you think was so important
about my sneakers, Chucky?

373
00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:06.950
You don't know either, do you?

374
00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.581
[yawns]

375
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.208

376

[tense music]

377
00:28:27.833 --> 00:28:30.200
Let me know if you find out
anything about those footprints.

378
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.706
[Andy] Mommy! Mommy!

379
00:28:31.875 --> 00:28:34.242
Mommy, I know who was
on the kitchen counter.

380
00:28:34.417 --> 00:28:36.374
- Andy! I thought I told...
- Who, Andy? Who?

381
00:28:37.042 --> 00:28:38.042
Chucky!

382
00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:39.625
Your doll?

383
00:28:41.125 --> 00:28:44.493
Andy, that's enough stories for tonight.
Now, come on, back to bed. I mean it!

384
00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:46.786
But Mom...

385
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.331
Good night, detective.

386
00:28:56.083 --> 00:28:57.915
- What?
- Are you going to call me?

387
00:28:58.083 --> 00:29:01.951
- You don't give up, do you?
- I just... I hate loose ends.

388
00:29:02.125 --> 00:29:03.925
And I hate people
who don't know when to stop.

389
00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:05.619
- Oof.
- [whistles]

390
00:29:05.792 --> 00:29:08.864
- Ouch. A spirited lady.
- No kidding.

391
00:29:09.542 --> 00:29:12.250
I want that autopsy report
on my desk first thing tomorrow.

392
00:29:12.458 --> 00:29:13.934
- Yeah.
- And anything you can find out

393
00:29:13.958 --> 00:29:15.414
about Mrs. Barclay and her son.

394
00:29:15.583 --> 00:29:18.200
You got it! Anything else
I can do for you, sir?

395
00:29:18.375 --> 00:29:21.663
Oh, yeah. Here. Get this to the lab.

396
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.866
I found it in the corner of the kitchen.

397
00:29:24.042 --> 00:29:26.249
- What is this?
- Possible murder weapon.

398
00:29:26.417 --> 00:29:27.532
No!

399
00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:30.249
Come on. You're kidding me.

400
00:29:31.917 --> 00:29:34.124
Hey, you are kidding me, aren't you?

401
00:29:39.542 --> 00:29:42.330
[Andy speaking indistinctly]

402
00:29:42.708 --> 00:29:44.915
[tense music]

403
00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:58.162
[Andy continues speaking indistinctly]

404
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.581
Andy, who are you talking to?

405
00:30:05.208 --> 00:30:06.824
Chucky.

406
00:30:18.208 --> 00:30:19.208
[Karen] Chucky, huh?

407
00:30:19.917 --> 00:30:21.828
[Andy] Yeah, sure, Chucky.

408
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.332
He's sitting right over there.

409
00:30:27.583 --> 00:30:29.494
Chucky's been talking to you too,
hasn't he?

410
00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:34.080
- What's he been saying?
- All kinds of things.

411
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.697
His real name is Charles Lee Ray

412
00:30:37.875 --> 00:30:41.573
and he's been sent down
from heaven by Daddy

413
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.411
to play with me.

414
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.913
He has, has he? Anything else?

415
00:30:51.083 --> 00:30:54.656
Yes. He said Aunt Maggie was a real bitch

416
00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:57.165
and got what she deserved.

417
00:30:57.625 --> 00:31:01.118
Andy, how can you say
something so horrible?

418
00:31:01.375 --> 00:31:03.537
I didn't say it. Chucky did.

419
00:31:03.708 --> 00:31:07.872
Andy, stop it. You know perfectly well
that you're making this up!

420
00:31:08.667 --> 00:31:11.830
But I'm not. Chucky's alive.
Really, he is.

421
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.867
Andy. Chucky. Chucky's a doll.

422
00:31:15.208 --> 00:31:17.370
He's made of plastic and stuffing.

423
00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:20.614
Look at him. Look at him.
Does he look like anything else to you?

424
00:31:20.792 --> 00:31:22.703
- Huh?
- Don't, you'll hurt him.

425
00:31:22.875 --> 00:31:24.206
Andy, look!

426
00:31:25.208 --> 00:31:27.916
Now, you don't really think
that Chucky is alive, do you?

427
00:31:28.542 --> 00:31:29.782
But he is.

428
00:31:29.958 --> 00:31:32.700
Andy, stop it! Please!

429
00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:38.157
It's 'cause of Aunt Maggie
you're yelling at me, isn't it?

430
00:31:41.292 --> 00:31:44.739
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.

431
00:31:45.208 --> 00:31:46.869
I'm sorry.

432
00:31:47.042 --> 00:31:49.830
I'll stop making up stories.

433
00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:52.329
[music continues]

434
00:31:55.042 --> 00:31:56.578
Thanks, champ.

435
00:31:58.375 --> 00:31:59.975
Do you want to sleep in with me tonight?

436
00:32:00.542 --> 00:32:02.078
No, it's all right.

437
00:32:02.667 --> 00:32:04.874
I've got Chucky.

438
00:32:08.708 --> 00:32:09.823
[softly] Come on, into bed.

I love you.

442
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.581
Bye-bye.

443
00:32:37.542 --> 00:32:41.911
You're right, Chucky.
She didn't believe me.

444
00:32:48.625 --> 00:32:50.832
Hi. I like to be hugged.

445
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.119
Good. I'd love to hug you too.

You sure you're all right
about last night?

450
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.491
No bad dreams about Aunt Maggie?

451
00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:18.832
And Chucky's only a doll, right?

452
00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:23.333
All right, off to school with you, then.
I love you tons.

I came as soon as I got your message.

496
00:39:11.208 --> 00:39:12.893
You haven't been to school
to pick up your son yet?

497
00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:17.081
- No. No, I came directly from work. Why?
- Let's go into my office.

498
00:39:18.208 --> 00:39:20.199
- Is something wrong with Andy?
- Please.

I, uh...

500
00:39:28.708 --> 00:39:30.588
I don't know how to tell you this,
Mrs. Barclay.

501
00:39:30.917 --> 00:39:31.998
Tell me what?

502
00:39:32.417 --> 00:39:35.864
Do you have any idea why your
Aunt Maggie fell out of that window?

503

- Yes.
- Could you tell me why?

504
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:44.369
'Cause she saw Chucky and
it scared her so much, she fell out.

Oh, she did, huh?

506
00:39:46.792 --> 00:39:48.999

- Mommy!
- Oh, Andy!

508

All right, sweetheart. Come on.

509
00:40:01.208 --> 00:40:02.994
Now listen to me, okay?

510
00:40:04.375 --> 00:40:06.992
Nobody believes you about Chucky.

511
00:40:07.875 --> 00:40:10.993
Unless you start telling the truth
right now...

512
00:40:12.208 --> 00:40:14.290
they're going to take you away from me.

513
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.036
You hear that, Chucky?

514
00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:22.451
They're taking me away
unless you say something.

515
00:40:25.167 --> 00:40:27.408
Please, say something.

516
00:40:28.708 --> 00:40:31.166
Come on, Chucky! Say something!

517
00:40:31.333 --> 00:40:34.997
Tell me why you lied to me
about everything.

518
00:40:35.167 --> 00:40:38.239
Come on, Chucky! Say something!

519
00:40:38.417 --> 00:40:40.033
Tell me!

I'm your friend to the end.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.992
Mommy, he's doing it on purpose!

524
00:40:50.167 --> 00:40:54.331
He told me never to tell about him
or he'd kill me.

<i>Mrs. Barclay, my name is Doctor Ardmore.</i>

<i>I'm from County General.</i>

527
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.787
<i>I've seen more than enough.</i>

528
00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:03.416
Maybe Andy should spend
a couple of days with us.

529
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.619
Well, say something, you little... bastard.

530
00:41:47.833 --> 00:41:49.574
Say something, damn it!

531
00:41:50.833 --> 00:41:53.200

Come on, talk!

543
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.788
I said talk to me, damn it! All right!

544
00:44:53.292 --> 00:44:54.999
Then I'm going to make you talk!

545
00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:11.075
I said talk to me, dammit,
or else I'm gonna throw you in the fire!

Oh, Detective Norris!

565
00:46:52.833 --> 00:46:54.309
Mrs. Barclay,
what are you doing back here?

566
00:46:54.333 --> 00:46:55.448
Andy was telling the truth.

567
00:46:55.833 --> 00:46:57.824
Chucky is alive and
he killed Eddie Caputo.

568
00:46:58.542 --> 00:46:59.542
What?

569
00:46:59.708 --> 00:47:00.851
I took him home to my apartment.

570
00:47:00.875 --> 00:47:04.038
I was about to throw away the box that
he came in when the batteries fell out.

571
00:47:04.292 --> 00:47:06.875
Don't you see? He's been moving
and talking for days

572
00:47:07.042 --> 00:47:08.407
without any batteries in him.

573
00:47:08.833 --> 00:47:11.746
- What are you talking about?
- How I found out the doll was alive.

574
00:47:11.917 --> 00:47:14.284
See, I threatened
to throw him into the fireplace

575
00:47:14.458 --> 00:47:16.870
when all of a sudden,
he came alive in my hand.

576
00:47:17.042 --> 00:47:19.374
I dropped him, and he got up and
ran out of the apartment.

577
00:47:20.875 --> 00:47:22.707
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.

578
00:47:22.875 --> 00:47:25.537
Wait a minute! I am telling you the truth!

579
00:47:25.917 --> 00:47:27.351
He killed Maggie, he killed Eddie Caputo.

580
00:47:27.375 --> 00:47:31.164
Look, Mrs. Barclay! I sympathize with you.
I really do.

581
00:47:31.333 --> 00:47:34.325
I hated what happened in there today,
but lying is not gonna...

582
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:37.037
Lying? Does this look like I'm lying?

583
00:47:38.792 --> 00:47:40.703
- How did you get those?
- Chucky bit me.

584
00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:43.708
Oh, for God's sake!

585
00:47:43.917 --> 00:47:45.373
All right, don't believe me!

586
00:47:47.458 --> 00:47:49.199
- Where you goin'?
- [Karen] To find Chucky!

587
00:47:50.042 --> 00:47:51.248
How you gonna do that?

588
00:47:51.417 --> 00:47:53.704
I bought it from a peddler where I work,
I'll start there.

589
00:47:53.875 --> 00:47:56.315
That isn't a good part of town to be in
at this time of night!

590
00:47:56.792 --> 00:47:58.203
Mrs. Barclay, do you hear me?

591
00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:01.367
You don't want to go down there
at this time of night!

Mister!

603

I'm not gonna hurt you.
Do you remember me?

604
00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:39.456
No, no.

605
00:49:39.625 --> 00:49:41.059
I... I'm sor... I bought a doll from you

606
00:49:41.083 --> 00:49:43.476
in back of Carson's department store
with my friend, yesterday.

607
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.537
- Doll?
- Yes. A Good Guy doll.

608
00:49:45.708 --> 00:49:48.826
- You sold it to me. Do you remember?
- Oh, yeah, a doll. What about it?

609
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.617
- Where did you get it?
- What will you give me if I tell you?

610
00:49:51.792 --> 00:49:57.458
Well, I don't have much but
you're welcome to whatever I have.

611
00:50:00.417 --> 00:50:02.283
It's not enough. What else you got?

612
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:05.957
- That's all I've got.
- All you got?

613
00:50:06.417 --> 00:50:08.499
- What are you... Yes.
- That's not all you got.

614

- All right, what about the rest of you?

619
00:50:21.833 --> 00:50:23.449
You wanna party too?

620
00:50:30.208 --> 00:50:32.476
All right, now, you want to answer
the lady's question now? Huh?

621
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.491
Where did you get the doll?

622
00:50:34.667 --> 00:50:36.499
I don't know nothin' about no doll.

623
00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:38.143
You're not gonna know nothin'
about nothin' in a minute

unless you talk to me, now talk!

625
00:50:39.542 --> 00:50:42.409
A burned-out toy store on Wabash!
That's where I got it.

626
00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:46.498
Get outta here!

627
00:50:48.875 --> 00:50:49.956
What's wrong?

628
00:50:51.875 --> 00:50:52.990
Nothing.

629
00:50:54.875 --> 00:50:57.675
Well, wait a minute. Something the peddler
said upset you. What was it?

630
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:59.161
I just told you, nothing.

631
00:51:00.125 --> 00:51:03.368
Goddamn it! My son's life
is at stake! Now, what was it?

632
00:51:05.208 --> 00:51:08.781
The place where he said he got the doll,
Charles Lee Ray died there.

633
00:51:09.042 --> 00:51:10.453
Who?

634
00:51:10.625 --> 00:51:13.788
The Lake Shore Strangler. The man who
was partners with Eddie Caputo.

635
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.118
- Whoa, hey. Where are you going now?
- Wabash and Van Buren.

636
00:51:18.292 --> 00:51:20.434
There's nothing there.
It's an abandoned wreck of a store.

637
00:51:20.458 --> 00:51:21.458
Why don't you believe me?

638
00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:24.162
It was struck by lightning
the night Charles Lee Ray died.

639
00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:29.370
- How do you know that?
- Because I was there!

640
00:51:29.542 --> 00:51:31.374
I was the man who killed him!

641
00:51:38.208 --> 00:51:39.243
Why didn't you tell me?

642
00:51:40.833 --> 00:51:44.155
It's not exactly the kind of thing
you tell someone.

643
00:51:44.667 --> 00:51:47.625
Come on. Let me take you home.
You need some sleep.

644
00:51:48.292 --> 00:51:50.283
- Did he say anything? Anything at all?
- Who?

645
00:51:50.458 --> 00:51:51.914
- Charles Lee Ray.
- Yeah.

646
00:51:52.083 --> 00:51:54.199
He threatened to kill me and Eddie Caputo.

647
00:52:07.542 --> 00:52:09.874
Sorry you couldn't find anything
to help Andy.

648
00:52:10.625 --> 00:52:12.207
I really am.

649
00:52:12.375 --> 00:52:15.822
But I did. I found out
that Chucky is Charles Lee Ray.

650
00:52:16.417 --> 00:52:18.704
The only thing I don't know
is how he got inside the doll.

651
00:52:21.167 --> 00:52:23.567
- Good night, Mrs. Barclay.
- Where did Charles Lee Ray live?

652
00:52:24.875 --> 00:52:27.207
Look, please, will you
just get out of the car?

653
00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:29.015
[Karen] Hey, just tell me where he lived.

654
00:52:29.125 --> 00:52:31.708
Don't you understand?
Andy's life depends on it.

655
00:52:32.333 --> 00:52:35.041
730 Stoney Island, the South Side.

656
00:52:35.208 --> 00:52:39.031
But I've already checked the place out.
There's nothing there. Now, good night.

657
00:52:39.208 --> 00:52:40.619
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

658
00:52:42.167 --> 00:52:44.367
- Home. Get some sleep.
- [Karen] No, you can't do that!

659
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.662
Don't you see? You just said it.

660
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.037
Chucky killed Caputo. That leaves you.

661
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:51.666
- That does it.
- [Karen] Oh, please listen to me.

662
00:52:56.542 --> 00:52:58.704
- Out.
- I am telling you the truth!

663
00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:01.617
- Why won't you believe me?
- Because I'm sane, Mrs. Barclay,

664
00:53:01.792 --> 00:53:02.907
sane and rational.

665
00:53:04.917 --> 00:53:06.828
All right! All right!

666
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.434
Do you remember what you said the
first night you met me in my apartment?

667
00:53:09.458 --> 00:53:11.226
- What about it?
- You said you didn't like loose ends.

668
00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:12.331
Well, I'm a loose end.

669
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.100
You can't just let go what I said tonight
without checking it out.

670
00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:17.457
For the last time,
Mrs. Barclay, good night.

What are you doing here?

714
00:58:51.208 --> 00:58:52.994
After I talked to you last night,

715
00:58:53.208 --> 00:58:56.075
I decided to go back to the station
and pull Ray's file.

716
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.288
I learned a couple of things.
His nickname was Chucky.

717
00:59:01.958 --> 00:59:03.824
He spent a lot of time with this man.

718
00:59:10.708 --> 00:59:14.076
Now all we have to do is find him
before Chucky does.

719
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.912
[tense music]

720
00:59:22.833 --> 00:59:24.619
[Chucky] Hello, John.

721
00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.207
Over here!

722
00:59:28.792 --> 00:59:29.827
Hi!

723
00:59:30.625 --> 00:59:32.036
It's me. Chucky.

724
00:59:32.542 --> 00:59:35.785
What d'ya think? The grigri work?

725
00:59:38.042 --> 00:59:41.785
You know, when I came here learning
all that stuff about how to beat death,

726
00:59:42.125 --> 00:59:44.583
I thought maybe you were pullin' my chain.

727
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:47.492
But not now. Uh-uh, not now.

728
00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:50.582
- Only one problem.
- What?

729
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:54.742
This. I didn't think
anybody could hurt me.

730
00:59:55.125 --> 00:59:56.661
But last night I got shot.

731
00:59:57.875 --> 00:59:59.741
Know somethin'? It hurt.

732
01:00:00.125 --> 01:00:02.662
It hurt like a son of a bitch.
It even bled.

733
01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:04.581
Why's that, John?

734
01:00:05.708 --> 01:00:07.870
- You're turning human.
- What?

735
01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:11.958
The more time you spend in that body...

736
01:00:13.417 --> 01:00:15.033
the more human you become.

737
01:00:16.833 --> 01:00:19.325
You mean I have to live out
the rest of my life in this body?

738
01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:24.493
No fucking way! You got me
into this, you get me out!

739
01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:28.659
- I can't do that, Chucky.
- Why not?

740
01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:31.875
Because you're an abomination!

741
01:00:32.708 --> 01:00:35.416
An outrage against nature!

742
01:00:35.583 --> 01:00:37.995
You've perverted everything
I've taught you

743
01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.874
and used it for evil!

744
01:00:40.042 --> 01:00:41.908
And you have to be stopped!

745
01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:48.575
You know, I thought
something like this might happen.

746
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:51.742
- That's why I prepared for it.
- What are you talking about?

747
01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:54.415
Your own personal mojo, Doc.

748
01:00:55.958 --> 01:00:58.416
- Give me that.
- Sure. How do you want it?

749
01:00:58.583 --> 01:00:59.823
Broken leg?

- [bones snapping]
- [screaming]

751
01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:06.827
Shouldn't tell your customers
where you hide things like this, John.

752
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.037
Gets you in trouble every time.

753
01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:11.870
Now how do I get out of this body?

754
01:01:12.042 --> 01:01:14.784
- No. I won't tell you.
- Yeah?

755

- [bones snapping]
- [screaming]

756
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:21.197
Tell me or die, John. Your choice.

757
01:01:21.625 --> 01:01:24.037
[sobbing] I'll tell you.

758
01:01:26.042 --> 01:01:29.080
You have to transfer your soul
out of the doll...

759
01:01:29.583 --> 01:01:33.497
into that of the first human being you
revealed your true self to.

760
01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:37.288
You mean the first person I let in on
the fact that I was really alive?

[laughs]

762
01:01:40.792 --> 01:01:43.454
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

763
01:01:43.625 --> 01:01:47.619
The first person I let in on my little
secret was a six-year-old kid.

764
01:01:47.792 --> 01:01:49.829
I'm gonna be six years old again.

765
01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:54.414
Well, John, it's been fun, but I gotta go.

766
01:01:54.792 --> 01:01:57.580
I have a date with a six-year-old boy.

767
01:01:58.542 --> 01:02:01.660
And you have a date with death.

- Too late.
- What?

776
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:51.833
Must save the boy. Must...

777
01:02:54.583 --> 01:02:56.540
Must get his soul...

778
01:02:57.292 --> 01:03:00.250
into him like he got into doll.

779
01:03:00.417 --> 01:03:01.417
What?

780
01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:05.906
You must stop him
before he can say the chant.

781
01:03:06.708 --> 01:03:09.200
Kill him before he can say it.

782

But how? How?

783
01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:16.414
The heart. His heart is almost human.

784
01:03:18.583 --> 01:03:21.996
It's the only way. Through the heart.
