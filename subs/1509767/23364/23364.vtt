00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,259
-Previously, on Beyond...

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,259
-You're from the Realm.

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,636
Everything you love

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,636
will be dust!

5
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,763
There's no stopping it now!

6
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,889
I like you,

7
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,600
and I would be garbage

8
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,600
if I let this go any further.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,436
Pastor Ian isn't

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,436
who he says he is.

11
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,230
He belongs to some cult,

12
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,230
and the FBI is investigating.

13
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,024
I found a camera.

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,024
I want that footage now.

15
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,609
I truly doubt you'd

16
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,609
wanna see it.

17
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:28,987
I tried to turn myself in.

18
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,405
-Tom--

19
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,405
-Let go!

20
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,531
Tom:

21
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,531
Hey, hey!

22
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,531
Let me go!

23
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,159
I'm Dr. Tolan,

24
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,159
Edgar's head doctor.

25
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,159
Shall we?

26
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,827
They're here, aren't they?

27
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,078
We gotta come back for 'em.

28
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,955
Edgar:

29
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,955
We gotta use that freezer

30
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,955
to block more of them

31
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:39,998
from comin' over.

32
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,332
-Ahh!

33
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,332
-(shatters)

34
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,128
-(electricity crackling)

35
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,128
-(alarm beeping)

36
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,671
(elevator chimes)

37
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,674
(elevator doors thud)

38
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,552
(elevator chimes)

39
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,055
(elevator doors thud)

40
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,932
(elevator chimes)

41
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,102
(elevator doors thud)

42
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,188
(elevator chimes)

43
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:06,983
(elevator doors thud)

44
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,530
Ughh...

45
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,325
This is just great.

46
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,288
-(thudding continues)

47
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,288
-(alarm continues)

48
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,018
Computer (distorted):

49
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,018
All cryo chambers online.

50
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,530
(doors thud)

51
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,455
Ms. Shoemacher...

52
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,455
they're gone!

53
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,840
Where did they go?

54
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,978
Borden:

55
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,978
Your mom doesn't know

56
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,978
you're here?

57
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,357
Are you okay?

58
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,028
No. No.

59
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,028
I am pretty far

60
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,028
from being okay.

61
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,196
I just...

62
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,913
I just really hope

63
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,913
you're for real.

64
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,793
I'm for real.

65
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,337
And I'm here to help.

66
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,759
Then tell me what you know

67
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,759
about Hollow Sky.

68
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,806
I have been pursuing Isaac Frost

69
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,767
and his organization

70
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,767
for years now,

71
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,811
and I am this close

72
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,022
to having the whole thing

73
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,022
by the balls.

74
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:14,027
But meanwhile, your family

75
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:14,027
is still in very real danger.

76
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,530
So, if you can share

77
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,530
what you know...

78
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,907
I can help you.

79
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,619
Here's the thing...

80
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,205
Hollow Sky is searching

81
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,205
for something.

82
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,792
Chasing rumors about people

83
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,792
who've developed abilities,

84
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,754
powers, and some kind

85
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,754
of machine,

86
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,799
invented by this cryptomystic,

87
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,799
Arthur Forman.

88
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,762
And... I ha-- no,

89
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,762
I didn't bring it.

90
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,140
Okay.

91
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,140
(sighs)

92
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,767
Luke, I'm just gonna ask you

93
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,767
point blank:

94
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,812
Has Holden ever demonstrated

95
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:55,026
any... odd or unusual behavior?

96
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,194
(scoffs)

97
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,740
Do flying cars count?

98
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:09,123
Then yeah, I would say

99
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:09,123
he has some... unique abilities.

100
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,750
Okay, but more importantly,

101
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,921
Hollow Sky is a warped

102
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,921
criminal cult.

103
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,674
Like full stop, I mean,

104
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,674
they kidnapped Holden,

105
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,801
like, held us

106
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,801
under armed guard

107
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,801
against our will.

108
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,511
-Wait, wait. Shh, shh!

109
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,511
-They put cameras in my house!

110
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,638
Shh! Shh, shh, shh.

111
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,726
They threatened us,

112
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,978
chased us!

113
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,937
Luke, that's why

114
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,937
I'm here.

115
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,856
We know about the machines.

116
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,151
-Do you know about the machines?

117
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,151
-Nothing good.

118
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,779
Elaborate.

119
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,992
How 'bout... we start

120
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,992
with the...

121
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:48,204
location of their little...

122
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:48,204
"black helicopter compound."

123
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,330
(pen clicks)

124
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,960
But you need to give me

125
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,960
your word...

126
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,963
that you will raid

127
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,963
that damn place

128
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,174
with, like...

129
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,174
big-ass guns.

130
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,593
Doin' the right thing.

131
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,145
Still can't believe

132
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,145
we're really gonna do this.

133
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,813
Still can't believe

134
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,813
you almost didn't do this,

135
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,025
especially after you guys

136
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,025
got so close last time?

137
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,901
It shouldn't even be

138
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,901
that hard.

139
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,778
You're suddenly

140
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,778
Seal Team commando now.

141
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,989
Yeah, we walk in,

142
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,989
snag Edgar, walk out,

143
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,992
put him in an ancient freezer

144
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,992
you found buried in the woods,

145
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,077
which will transport him

146
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,077
interdimensionally

147
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,787
to another realm of existence,

148
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,749
where Edgar will make it stop

149
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,749
leaking cranky demons

150
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,709
hellbent

151
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,709
on destroying our world,

152
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,335
starting

153
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,335
with the Matthews family.

154
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:40,798
What is so hard about that?

155
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:40,798
Grab the Kit-Kats.

156
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,384
I don't care

157
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,384
how hard it is, okay?

158
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,763
We've got one shot, one.

159
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,763
To pull this off.

160
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,892
Like we talked about

161
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,892
last night, I'm through running.

162
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,976
So are you.

163
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,227
You got it, hotshot.

164
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,775
And, um... listen.

165
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,775
I am totally down to rescue

166
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,943
a fellow Hollow-Sky

167
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,943
patient-slave,

168
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,821
as long as you're up to it.

169
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,032
You can't keep going on

170
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,032
like this forever.

171
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,326
It's gotta be hittin'

172
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,326
close to home.

173
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,828
And this is the easy part.

174
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,706
I'm only rescuing Edgar

175
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,706
so I can stop Diego.

176
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,042
I know.

177
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,712
I saw him, too.

178
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:21,881
Uhh--

179
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,800
Hey.

180
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,800
Hey...

181
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,594
You okay?

182
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:31,891
Yeah. Sorry, just, uh...

183
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:31,891
pre-game jitters.

184
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,062
Woo-hoo!

185
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,062
Three points!

186
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,772
Huh-ha!

187
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,732
And 20 percent off!

188
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,692
Look, Jeff, I told you,

189
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,692
we're not here for this.

190
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,612
-This is my membership card,

191
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,612
motherf--

192
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,612
-Funyuns!

193
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,075
All right, listen,

194
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,075
I only had a few minutes

195
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,075
to case the area,

196
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,870
but my... somewhat crude map

197
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,870
here shows--

198
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,414
Crude?

199
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,414
No, Jeff, not crude at all.

200
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,835
Shows that

201
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,835
the TV room's adjacent

202
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,835
to the loading area there.

203
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,755
Thursday just so happens

204
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,755
to be... Edgar's TV day.

205
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,258
Now, if we're able to find

206
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,258
an alternate entrance

207
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,927
-and avoid detection...

208
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,927
-We'll have ourselves

209
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,927
a standard grab-and-bag.

210
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,097
Hey. Hey!

211
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,097
Get back! Back! Back!

212
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,765
I wouldn't say standard.

213
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,475
This is a guy

214
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,475
who blew up a TV.

215
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,855
-With his mind.

216
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,855
-And you know,

217
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,855
as a TV-exploding veteran,

218
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,565
I can promise you...

219
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,485
we don't know what this guy

220
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,485
will do, or doesn't do...

221
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,695
or won't do.

222
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,493
Why didn't he wake up?

223
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,493
Every other cryo patient gone,

224
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,493
but not Frost.

225
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,873
-Why?

226
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,873
-Good question.

227
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,125
I've been wondering

228
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,125
the same thing.

229
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,169
But does it really matter?

230
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,920
Would it explain any of this?

231
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,881
Or the side effects?

232
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,550
Get me up to speed.

233
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,550
Do you have any idea

234
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,550
where they went?

235
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,594
We're not

236
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,594
the Missing Persons Bureau,

237
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,345
and it's time

238
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,345
we cut our losses.

239
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,473
We're moving Frost

240
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,473
to another lab.

241
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,641
Our people on the outside are

242
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,641
keeping the authorities at bay

243
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,810
until this can all get broomed,

244
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,771
before anyone

245
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,771
in the congregation

246
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,771
gets wind of it.

247
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,275
Why does it seem

248
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,275
like you're just checking boxes?

249
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,860
Because that's

250
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,860
what managers do.

251
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,905
Anticipate. Decide.

252
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,905
Be proactive, not reactive.

253
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,949
Some of this

254
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,949
you can learn at school.

255
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,743
Now those who wear

256
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,743
the big-boy pants

257
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,579
know that we're sitting

258
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,579
on nearly nine figures

259
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,579
in contributions.

260
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,331
Our job is to protect

261
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,331
that investment,

262
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,166
as well as the belief system

263
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,166
of our clientele,

264
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,002
which this would,

265
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,002
in my estimation,

266
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,378
(whispers)

267
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,378
threaten.

268
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,089
Yeah.

269
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,089
It's all threatening something.

270
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,135
It just seems

271
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,135
like our clientele

272
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,970
aren't the only ones

273
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,970
you've been lookin' out for.

274
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,222
What's that supposed to mean?

275
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,098
Means I don't believe you.

276
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,100
I see.

277
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,687
And yet, I thought you'd

278
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,687
do anything for the cause.

279
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,649
Maybe it's time

280
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,649
you started acting

281
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,901
like you believed

282
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,901
in something.

283
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,655
Well, I believe

284
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,655
we have a much bigger problem.

285
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,740
(sighs)

286
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,740
What's that?

287
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,784
The FBI.

288
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,786
They've been working

289
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,786
with the Holden Matthews family.

290
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:01,791
From what I understand...

291
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:01,791
they're extremely proactive.

292
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,220
Diane.

293
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,807
-Stay away.

294
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,807
-Hey. Please.

295
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,308
I need you to understand.

296
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,603
My feelings for you were true.

297
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,898
I never betrayed you

298
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,898
in my heart.

299
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,400
Really?

300
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,442
And where was your heart

301
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,403
when you were recording

302
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,403
me and the boys in our home

303
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,487
without my knowledge?

304
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,615
What reason

305
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,615
could you possibly have?

306
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,037
Do you understand that

307
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,037
I will destroy any threat

308
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,037
to protect my children?

309
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,581
So are you gonna

310
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,581
stop apologizing

311
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,666
and tell me something

312
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,666
that will actually help?

313
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,837
No.

314
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,837
I didn't think so.

315
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,674
-(footsteps)

316
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,674
-(car alarm beeps)

317
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,636
Diane, I'm--

318
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,636
I'm not a bad man.

319
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,555
I'm just not a strong man.

320
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,223
We were-- We were

321
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,223
together for months

322
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,642
before they came to me

323
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,642
with this request.

324
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,105
-And by then, I was--

325
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,105
-You thought it wouldn't matter.

326
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,569
Yes!

327
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,575
I have a meeting

328
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,575
with the FBI today.

329
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,370
So if you...

330
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,916
ever cared about me,

331
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,916
or Luke, or Holden,

332
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,001
come with me.

333
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,129
Talk to them.

334
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,129
It's your choice.

335
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,716
Thank you.

336
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,804
Thank you, I will.

337
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,804
I'll be there.

338
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,812
(engine starts)

339
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,077
-(buzzer)

340
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,077
-(door opens)

341
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,454
-Officer:

342
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,454
Lunchtime, fellas.

343
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,454
-(door closes)

344
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,998
Suit yourself.

345
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,754
(speaking Spanish)

346
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,926
Tom:

347
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,926
Hey, who's in there?

348
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,303
Hey! Hey!

349
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,430
-(buzzer)

350
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,430
-(door opens)

351
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,600
(door closes)

352
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,025
You're the one who

353
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,025
attacked my son, aren't you?

354
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,943
You son of a bitch.

355
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,239
Turn around.

356
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,416
(speaking Spanish)

357
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,754
The hell did you say?

358
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:00,261
You can't protect

359
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:00,261
your son... Papa.

360
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,939
What's coming

361
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,939
at your son, Holden...

362
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,364
you can't protect him.

363
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,826
(bangs on bars)

364
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,206
You better hope to hell

365
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,206
I never get outta here.

366
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,552
Charlie:

367
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,552
How's it going?

368
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,105
Hey, can you get the door?

369
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,105
Thank you.

370
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,700
Okay.

371
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,700
She's in.

372
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,167
It's like Christmas mornin'

373
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,167
every Thursday, am I right?

374
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,755
No. I said, we can't take

375
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,755
anything frozen today.

376
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,465
Sorry, it's gotta go back

377
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,465
in the truck.

378
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,760
Are you kidding me?

379
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,760
I can't let this stuff

380
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,760
melt in my truck.

381
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,220
Guard:

382
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,220
Not my problem.

383
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,811
Through reception.

384
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,814
Corridor two, which leads

385
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,814
to the TV break room.

386
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:39,235
(on radio)

387
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:39,235
Great map, gents.

388
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:39,235
Six-year-old draw this thing?

389
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,492
I'm at the TV room.

390
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,744
I got it.

391
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,744
I got it from here.

392
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,079
-Sshh!

393
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,079
-What?

394
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,163
Okay?

395
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,163
I can't hear.

396
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,706
Charlie:

397
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,706
Guys, we may

398
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,706
have a problem.

399
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,708
It's 2:00 p.m.

400
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,961
You guys said Edgar

401
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,961
wouldn't miss an Alf rerun

402
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,212
for all the freezers

403
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,212
in Kansas,

404
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,257
so where... is he?

405
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,676
Alf:

406
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,676
I wouldn't eat a cat,

407
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,676
I only like kittens.

408
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,308
Holden on radio:

409
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,308
Do you even know

410
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,308
what Edgar looks like?

411
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,394
Yeah, okay-- yeah,

412
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,394
I'm pretty sure I remember,

413
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,813
a tall, fat, Chinese guy

414
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,813
with red hair, right?

415
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,983
-Patient: Ice cream.

416
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,983
-Nurse: Hey.

417
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,401
-Patient: Ice cream.

418
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,401
-Nurse: Sssh. Ssshh.

419
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,778
-There's no ice cream today,

420
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,778
I told you before.

421
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,778
-Ice... cream.

422
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,782
-Ice... cream.

423
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,782
-Nurse: C'mon. Calm down.

424
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,827
-Calm down.

425
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,827
-Patients: Ice cream.

426
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,122
-Nurse: Guys!

427
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,122
-Ice cream!

428
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,122
Ice cream!

429
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,249
Ice cream!

430
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,420
Okay, girl.

431
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,420
I guess plan B is on you.

432
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,171
What else is new?

433
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,049
-Sit down!

434
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,049
-Ice cream!

435
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,926
Ice cream.

436
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,140
Explain to me

437
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,140
why receiving

438
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,140
won't hold my stuff

439
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,766
till the freezer's fixed?

440
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,936
I mean, you know

441
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,936
ice cream melts, right?

442
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,605
(footsteps)

443
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,861
Hey, guys...

444
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,861
it looks like your,

445
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,861
uh, Dr. Tolan?

446
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,404
Dead to rights.

447
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,367
Except, why is she

448
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,367
wearing a parka?

449
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,869
Jeff, Jeff!

450
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,869
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

451
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,078
We got Tolan.

452
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,914
Edgar can't be far away.

453
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,839
(elevator beeps)

454
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,730
(beeping)

455
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,491
(video game noises)

456
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,743
Put the game away

457
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,743
and give me your radio.

458
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,296
(shivering)

459
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,264
Charlie: I lost Tolan

460
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,264
in the freight elevator,

461
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,264
which is locked.

462
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,599
This way.

463
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,059
What do you mean it's locked?

464
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,060
You need a key card to get in.

465
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,146
Ice cream!

466
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,357
Okay, well,

467
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,357
Edgar's not here.

468
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,318
Why didn't you

469
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,318
check his room?

470
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,195
Using these crappy maps?

471
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,656
-Hey...

472
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,656
-Besides,

473
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,656
there's guards everywhere,

474
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,116
and everything's locked.

475
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,868
I mean,

476
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,868
what do I look like, Buffy?

477
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,247
-Kinda.

478
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,247
-Shhhhh!

479
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,247
Guys, keep it down.

480
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,958
-Ice cream!

481
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,958
-There's no ice cream

482
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,958
for the TV group today.

483
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,459
Okay, didn't you hear?

484
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,961
But I don't want

485
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,961
the group's ice cream.

486
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,839
I want my ice cream!

487
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,173
I want ice cream!

488
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,758
It's Thursday!

489
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,343
Where's my ice cream?

490
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,886
You know ice cream melts, right?

491
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,682
-Patients:

492
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,682
Ice cream.

493
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,682
-Edgar's in the freezer.

494
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,601
Yeah, we know,

495
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,601
we gotta get Edgar

496
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,601
to the freezer.

497
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,021
No no no, no.

498
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,021
Edgar's in the freezer.

499
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,814
Here.

500
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,399
Ice cream!

501
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,900
We gotta get down there.

502
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,444
Ice cream!

503
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,738
Wait here.

504
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,741
I've got an idea.

505
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,869
It's ice cream time!

506
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,869
Here, everyone!

507
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,537
Here you go.

508
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,537
We've got chocolate.

509
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,539
Who likes tutti fruiti?

510
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,539
I know you do.

511
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,915
And I know you do.

512
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,209
Nice.

513
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,130
(patients clamoring)

514
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,966
Here's one for you.

515
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,763
(chuckles)

516
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,763
Nice.

517
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,806
Jeff:

518
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,806
C'mon, let's go.

519
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,806
Let's go!

520
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,324
He'll show up.

521
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,456
And... if he doesn't show up,

522
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,667
it doesn't necessarily mean

523
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,667
he was lying about everything.

524
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,668
You know?

525
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,923
I understand.

526
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,216
-Thank you.

527
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,216
-Mm.

528
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,594
But it's not

529
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,594
just about Ian anymore,

530
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,594
it's about my family now.

531
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,139
Believe me, I get it.

532
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,683
I have a handful myself.

533
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,186
James. Seventeen.

534
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,605
He's playing the saxophone

535
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,605
in the school band tonight,

536
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,981
and I'll miss it...

537
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,274
again.

538
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,819
I know, I work too much.

539
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,362
Yeah.

540
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,362
I know how you feel.

541
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,033
God, Holden's

542
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,033
younger brother Luke,

543
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,954
he's had to practically

544
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,954
fend for himself

545
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,954
most of his life.

546
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,539
I didn't know

547
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,539
you had another son.

548
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,959
Can we get

549
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,959
a couple of refills?

550
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,569
There it is.

551
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,831
-(screech)

552
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,831
-(crash)

553
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,083
(glass breaking)

554
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,751
Son of a--

555
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,628
What the hell

556
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,628
were you thinking?

557
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,552
Dr. Tolan:

558
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,552
You know I don't like this,

559
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,804
but I'm trying to help you.

560
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,932
And I can't help you

561
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,932
unless you give me

562
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,932
some answers,

563
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,726
so, why don't we try again?

564
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,936
Edgar?

565
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,771
How are you starting fires?

566
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,649
Talk to me.

567
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,818
Have you gotten

568
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,818
a hold of medications?

569
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,779
Chemicals?

570
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,779
Is there some trick?

571
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,781
Why are you doing this

572
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,781
to me?

573
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:04,244
Edgar, these past few weeks,

574
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:04,244
it's nothing but outbursts

575
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,372
and Holden, Holden, Holden.

576
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,667
Yes. I've looked

577
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,667
into Holden Matthews, Edgar,

578
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,127
he was also in a coma.

579
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,421
Just like you.

580
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,091
I find that rather coincidental,

581
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,091
don't you?

582
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,261
Can he do unusual things, too?

583
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,471
Stop.

584
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,849
Something's not right.

585
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,685
Edgar.

586
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,687
These aren't doctor questions.

587
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,902
(breathing)

588
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,329
Edgar, you don't

589
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,329
wanna do this.

590
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,873
You know it's pointless.

591
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,130
Man:

592
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,130
Hey, Eddie, we've got

593
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,130
a disturbance in the TV room.

594
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,343
(breathing)

595
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,308
This can be over,

596
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,308
Edgar. Anytime.

597
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,857
(door closing)

598
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,822
(door closing)

599
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,949
(video game noises, stops)

600
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,956
(video game resumes)

601
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,257
Jeff:

602
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,257
All right, we need to haul ass

603
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,257
right now.

604
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,509
Let's put this rent-a-cop

605
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,509
outta commission ASAP.

606
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,304
-Yeah.

607
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,304
-(Charlie clears throat)

608
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,597
What?

609
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,643
-Outta commission.

610
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,643
-Right.

611
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,730
Let's go coma-boy,

612
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,730
you got a smorgasbord here.

613
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,772
Okay.

614
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,066
Too noisy.

615
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,861
Too Manson.

616
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,238
-Um...

617
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,238
-Dude.

618
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,410
Okay.

619
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,797
(clattering)

620
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,723
Nice try.

621
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,683
They can't all be winners.

622
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,268
Okay, Jeff,

623
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,268
you got any ideas?

624
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,936
Jeff? Jeff?

625
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,813
(clearing throat)

626
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,813
Excuse me?

627
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,398
Mr. Fat-Ass?

628
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,235
Are you gonna save

629
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,235
any of that food in the freezer

630
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,235
for the rest of us?

631
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,324
-Is he always

632
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,324
this impatient?

633
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,324
-I...

634
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,243
(grunts)

635
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,495
Damn!

636
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:57,250
All right... now I'm ready.

637
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,877
-Ooh!

638
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,877
-(grunting)

639
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,213
-(punches landing)

640
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,213
-(grunting)

641
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,926
Ooh...

642
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,055
-Ahhh--

643
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,055
-Oooh!

644
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,974
(grunting)

645
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,726
Go. Go!

646
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:16,770
Now! Now!

647
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,689
-(grunting)

648
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,689
-Jeff: I got this!

649
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,817
Ohh! Ohh!

650
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,402
Edgar!

651
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,490
Um, we're here to rescue you!

652
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,367
That's the best you got?

653
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,994
(Jeff grunting)

654
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,288
Ooh.

655
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,792
-(grunts)

656
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,792
-Ooh!

657
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,713
(grunting)

658
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,798
Ahh!

659
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,757
Aaah!

660
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,467
(silverware falling)

661
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,928
Okay, here we go.

662
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,847
(banging noises)

663
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,856
Come on!

664
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,819
-You okay?

665
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,819
-You good?

666
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,819
Okay. Let's go!

667
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,239
(thud)

668
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,951
Jeff!

669
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,745
(banging on door)

670
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,789
-Jeff!

671
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,789
-Uhh!

672
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,876
(grunting)

673
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,839
(clattering)

674
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,674
Jeff!

675
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,674
Open the door!

676
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,218
We got trapped in here!

677
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,218
We've gotta go!

678
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,433
Uggh! Oww!

679
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,273
(coughs)

680
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,616
Were you ready for that?

681
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,289
Hey.

682
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,334
You better be worth it, man.

683
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,960
Saddle up,

684
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,960
let's get the hell outta here.

685
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,462
Yeah.

686
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,844
Good job.

687
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,725
Ohh... party's over, Scarface.

688
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,978
-(moans)

689
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,978
-Try to focus.

690
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,444
(laptop beeping)

691
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,542
(doorbell rings)

692
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,760
(inaudible)

693
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,309
Okay, I know that I said

694
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,309
that we shouldn't see

695
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,309
each other,

696
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,981
and... you know,

697
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,981
I totally butchered

698
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,981
that whole conversation,

699
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,316
'cause-- why are you

700
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,316
leading with that?

701
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,528
Why?

702
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,528
God, you're such an idiot.

703
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,113
Luke.

704
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,783
Uhh...

705
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,035
hey, Willa.

706
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,539
Are you okay?

707
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,959
Yeah.

708
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,959
Yeah, I, uh...

709
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,962
Hey, look, I-- I'm-- I'm sorry,

710
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,798
I-- I actually really

711
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,798
despise people that

712
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,798
just show up like this.

713
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,135
I mean, why can't they

714
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,135
just pick up the phone first?

715
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,887
Let you know

716
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,887
that they're coming?

717
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,890
Do you...

718
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,890
wanna come in?

719
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,227
Yeah.

720
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,227
I do.

721
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,228
Good.

722
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,897
I wanna show you something.

723
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,404
Whoa-hah-hoh.

724
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,534
Wha-- So, uh...

725
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,246
this thing also

726
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,246
takes you into the Realm?

727
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,289
At one time, it did.

728
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,958
What...

729
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:13,298
very, uh... county fair.

730
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,552
Mm, before Hollow Sky

731
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,552
turned into a theme park,

732
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,552
I guess.

733
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,769
But if this machine

734
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,769
takes you into the Realm,

735
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,397
I mean, like, wh-- why the hell

736
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,397
are you trying to fix it?

737
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:33,485
Because, Holden believes

738
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:33,485
he did something to corrupt

739
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:33,485
the Realm,

740
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,237
that he let something bad

741
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,237
cross over into our world.

742
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,198
If I can get this

743
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,198
machine to work,

744
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,824
I think I can set things right,

745
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,701
make everything how it was.

746
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,912
You wanna know what I think?

747
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,874
I-- I think it's time

748
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,874
to stop obsessing

749
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,874
over magic machines.

750
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,751
-Luke.

751
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,751
-Willa.

752
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,669
I spoke to the FBI.

753
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,756
-You what?

754
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,756
-I had to.

755
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,760
They already

756
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,760
have an investigation

757
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,760
going on for Hollow Sky.

758
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,889
Hey-- Hey?

759
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,889
I really think that they

760
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,889
can help us.

761
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,142
And what's gonna happen

762
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,142
to Arthur when they help us?

763
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,645
When the FBI

764
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,645
breaks all of this open,

765
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,188
what's gonna happen to him?

766
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,525
Something that should've

767
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,525
happened long ago.

768
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,861
He's right, Willa.

769
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,947
-It's caused

770
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,947
too much suffering.

771
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,947
-Arthur--

772
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,535
Maybe it's time

773
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,535
for all of this to come

774
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,535
to an end.

775
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,789
I'm ready if you are.

776
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,962
(buzzing)

777
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,422
C'mon, c'mon c'mon, c'mon.

778
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,715
Oh, no no no no no.

779
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,715
It's supposed--

780
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,715
It's supposed to work.

781
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,886
-Oh, great.

782
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,886
-(card buzzing)

783
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,096
Dr. Tolan:

784
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,096
Holden Matthews.

785
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,058
So nice to see you again.

786
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,601
You too, Dr. Chang.

787
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,812
(quietly)

788
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,812
Stand back.

789
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,536
We may not have time

790
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,536
for the usual wind-up here,

791
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,536
know what I mean?

792
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,083
(door rattling)

793
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,668
(crash)

794
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,338
(laughs)

795
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,305
Dr. Tolan:

796
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,305
Edgar? You've known me

797
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,305
for many years,

798
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,183
I've always looked out for you,

799
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,183
you're safe here.

800
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,394
We've always taken care of you

801
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,394
when no one else would.

802
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,982
Those men from yesterday,

803
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,982
they weren't who they said

804
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,982
they were,

805
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,567
that makes them liars.

806
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,860
Edgar, you understand that?

807
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,741
You guys move on.

808
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,741
I got this.

809
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,834
Edgar...

810
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,834
we're your family here.

811
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,254
My family's dead.

812
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,717
Don't talk about my family.

813
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,760
Edgar...

814
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,765
(bubbling)

815
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,976
(sizzling)

816
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,897
He's turning this place

817
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,897
into an oven!

818
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,900
Uhhh...

819
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,361
-(yelling)

820
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,361
-(sizzling)

821
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,739
This can be over... anytime.

822
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,910
(moaning and grunting)

823
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,538
(whispering)

824
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,538
Edgar.

825
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,914
(screaming) Oh god!

826
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,332
Edgar.

827
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,042
Please!

828
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,628
Edgar!

829
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,756
We need to go.

830
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,801
It's over...

831
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,886
now.

832
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,596
(distressed murmurs)

833
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,484
Ohhh!

834
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,112
Just let me go!

835
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,738
I-- I won't tell anyone.

836
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,741
I promise.

837
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,741
I mean, I haven't

838
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,741
even seen your faces.

839
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:16,499
Problem is...

840
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:16,499
I don't believe anything

841
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:16,499
you say...

842
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,793
because you lied to me before

843
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,295
about recording

844
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,295
your surveillance.

845
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,381
I didn't lie.

846
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,381
I didn't lie.

847
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,966
Holden's folks wouldn't

848
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,966
have hit the panic button

849
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,511
and called the feds

850
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,511
if they didn't see proof

851
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,511
that you were spying on 'em.

852
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,556
Me? No no, not me,

853
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,556
no, y-- your people--

854
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,516
-I was just--

855
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,516
-Only following orders?

856
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,769
You know,

857
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,769
I think I've heard that

858
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,769
someplace before.

859
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,355
Listen. Listen.

860
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,817
I have been a Hollow Sky

861
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,817
youth leader for six years.

862
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,320
I wouldn't have done anything

863
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,320
to harm the church.

864
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,989
Then why were you running?

865
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,786
I was coming in

866
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,786
from the cold.

867
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,622
Coming in to whom?

868
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,250
I'm not your enemy.

869
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,253
I have followed the teachings

870
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,253
of Isaac Frost.

871
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,838
That's interesting.

872
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,506
So then you'd say

873
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,506
that you're a true believer?

874
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,842
-Yes.

875
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,842
-And as a man of God,

876
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,053
-you believe in what

877
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,053
we're trying to accomplish?

878
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,053
-Yes.

879
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,597
I don't mean the mental health

880
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,597
stuff and the yoga classes.

881
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,098
I'm talkin' about beating death.

882
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,725
-Yes!

883
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,725
-You're sayin' you believe

884
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,725
in them?

885
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,937
Yes! Yes!

886
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,937
Yes, I believe in the bridge

887
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,937
to the afterlife.

888
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,605
That we can cross that bridge

889
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,605
back and forth?

890
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,106
Yes! Yes.

891
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,152
Then why are you

892
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,152
afraid to die?

893
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,907
I'm not afraid to die.

894
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,702
Good.

895
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:39,791
Because as you know...

896
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:39,791
death is only the beginning.

897
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,294
So then we agree...

898
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,088
you're not gonna kill me then?

899
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,548
No.

900
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,219
I'm in management now.

901
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,142
(bird cawing)

902
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,941
No.

903
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,941
No, no, no.

904
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,568
No, no, no!

905
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,568
No! No!

906
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,404
(gunshot)

907
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,370
-Thank you.

908
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,370
-Here's to us.

909
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,622
Hm-hm, and our new project.

910
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:23,167
-(sighs)

911
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:23,167
-Some things

912
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:23,167
are worth waiting for.

913
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,212
Baby, I told you.

914
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,176
Don't play with me, Tess.

915
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,596
Something is wrong,

916
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,596
and it's been wrong

917
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,596
for a while now.

918
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,348
So just level with me

919
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,348
and tell me what it is.

920
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,766
I have cancer.

921
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:42,895
Ovarian.

922
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,823
How long have you known?

923
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:59,162
-Couple months.

924
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:59,162
-A couple--

925
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,581
Wh-- how on earth

926
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,581
could you justify

927
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,583
keeping something

928
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,583
like this from me?

929
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,834
I'm sorry, Robin.

930
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,919
Robin, truly, I'm--

931
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,048
I just could never

932
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,048
seem to find the words.

933
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,384
Just listen.

934
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,140
It's in remission.

935
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,435
The prognosis

936
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,435
is extremely optimistic.

937
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,936
And that's not even

938
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,936
the good news.

939
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,399
What good news?

940
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,862
I'm about to wrap

941
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,862
some things up at work.

942
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:33,863
I mean...

943
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,742
You mean... retire?

944
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:43,790
I'm on the brink...

945
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:43,790
of finally reaping the benefits

946
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,209
of all this... struggle.

947
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,963
We both know that things

948
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,963
have been complicated at work.

949
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,467
I know.

950
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,760
You don't have to explain.

951
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,971
To see this through...

952
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,850
to finally do the things

953
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,850
that we talked about,

954
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,268
dreamed about.

955
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,356
We're going to have to go

956
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,356
as far away as possible...

957
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,443
and never come back.

958
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,032
You got an exit strategy?

959
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,620
Yeah.

960
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,539
-You bet your ass.

961
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,539
-(laughs softly)

962
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,504
Garza:

963
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,504
Oh, whoa, whoa,

964
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,504
whoa, easy, easy.

965
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,880
-Easy!

966
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,880
-(country music plays

967
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,880
on radio)

968
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,257
You're coming in too hot.

969
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:37,969
Boom.

970
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,930
Much as I enjoy your company,

971
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,765
can't say I wouldn't

972
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,765
rather be down at Wayne's

973
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,684
for LT's going away party.

974
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,810
Your turn.

975
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,229
Someone's gotta mind the store

976
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,229
in case of a city riot.

977
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,117
I'm looking for the prisoner.

978
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,204
-Come again?

979
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,204
-The prisoner.

980
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,585
What prisoner?

981
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,590
Why don't you just

982
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,590
take a seat, homie?

983
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,853
Senior Deputy Garza

984
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,853
for Sheriff Dayton.

985
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,901
Well, find him.

986
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,324
Pete?

987
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,868
Where the hell'd you go?

988
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,288
Pete?

989
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,833
-(door creaking)

990
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,833
-Deputy Adler, respond!

991
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,006
(door shuts)

992
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,892
Pete?

993
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,817
Pete?

994
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,654
Are you there?!

995
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,247
Run!

996
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,291
Run!

997
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,550
We're under attack, Jimmy!

998
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,511
Jimmy:

999
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,511
I saw them out front.

1000
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,511
They're surrounding the place.

1001
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,890
Who the hell are they?

1002
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,766
(gun cocks)

1003
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,769
-Jimmy: What the hell?

1004
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,769
-(generator whirs)

1005
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,823
(loud banging)

1006
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,491
Stay calm.

1007
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,701
Take a position.

1008
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,329
(guns cocking)

1009
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,502
-(gunshot)

1010
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,502
-(cocks gun)

1011
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,964
Go, go! Now!

1012
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,465
(gunshots muffled,

1013
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,465
shouting indistinct)

1014
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,134
Hey!

1015
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,428
What's going on out there?!

1016
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,888
-(gunshots, shouting continue)

1017
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,888
-Let me out!

1018
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,016
(gunshots, shouting continues)

1019
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,905
Who are you people?

1020
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,287
(cell door unlocks)

1021
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,846
(grunts)

1022
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,103
Do you remember, Papa,

1023
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,606
what I said about how

1024
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,606
you couldn't protect your son?

1025
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,611
Told ya.

1026
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,406
(grunts)

1027
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,415
Edgar:

1028
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,415
It's here!

1029
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,875
This is where I buried it.

1030
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,212
How'd you bury it so deep?

1031
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,588
Edgar:

1032
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,588
With a shovel.

1033
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,802
Edgar was amazing back there.

1034
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,346
-Yep.

1035
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,346
-Edgar: We're close!

1036
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,764
We're getting close!

1037
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,683
I'm just not sure

1038
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,683
it's the kind of amazing

1039
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,394
I find personally attractive.

1040
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,812
You know what I mean.

1041
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,688
He was brave.

1042
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,815
You know, braver than anyone

1043
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,900
I'd ever seen

1044
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,900
up close like that before.

1045
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,862
Yeah, that is not a guy

1046
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,862
who's ever gonna be--

1047
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:07,947
Normal.

1048
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,782
I thought we gave up

1049
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,782
on that whole--

1050
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,034
-I know, we did. It's just--

1051
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,034
-Edgar: It's just up here!

1052
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,786
Jeff:

1053
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,786
Edgar, calm down.

1054
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,456
It's just... is that

1055
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,456
gonna be me in 20 years?

1056
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,624
Is that where I'm heading?

1057
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,336
You know, someone's tool

1058
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,336
rotting in a lab,

1059
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,548
praying to be rescued

1060
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,548
by a merry band of soc...

1061
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,976
You know I won't

1062
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,976
let that happen.

1063
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,394
Edgar:

1064
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,394
I found it!

1065
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,188
I found it!

1066
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,821
Holden:

1067
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,821
Okay, so, uh...

1068
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,781
you get in the-- the freezer.

1069
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,491
The freezer takes you

1070
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,491
to the Realm,

1071
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,369
-and that's basically

1072
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,369
how you're going to--

1073
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,369
-Oh, no, no, no. No.

1074
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,746
"Oh, no," what?

1075
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,746
What's "Oh, no?"

1076
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,957
I'm not going in,

1077
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,957
Holden Matthews.

1078
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,085
You are.

1079
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,795
Uh, come again, bro?

1080
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,921
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1081
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,506
Hold up a damn second.

1082
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,550
We just busted you out,

1083
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,550
so you could go--

1084
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,593
I can only show you how.

1085
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,095
But the actual journey? That--

1086
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,890
that privilege

1087
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,890
belongs to Holden...

1088
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,641
and Holden alone.

1089
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,864
(Holden sighs)

1090
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,864
Screw it.

1091
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,284
Let's do this.

1092
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,167
(theme music plays)
