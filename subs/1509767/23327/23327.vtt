00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040
<font color="#ffff00">He was supposed to meet me.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Where?</font>

144
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,880
<font color="#ffff00">The station. I've been visiting</font>
<font color="#ffff00">our daughter.</font>

145
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,160
<font color="#ffff00">I waited and waited.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Mrs Coke Norris...</font>

146
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,840
<font color="#ffff00">If he says he's going to be</font>
<font color="#ffff00">somewhere, then he invariably is.</font>

147
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,600
Mrs Coke Norris, um...

148
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,240
I'm afraid to say I may have some
very bad news for you.

149
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,880
Last night I was called to attend
a road accident.

150
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,920
We'll need you to make
a formal identification, but...

151
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,040
..I have strong reason to believe
that the man who lost his life was
your husband.

152
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,280
<font color="#ffff00">Oh...</font>

153
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,440
Is there someone that we can notify?
Your daughter, perhaps?

154
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,680
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry.</font>

155
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,840
Six, five, four,

156
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,880
three, two, one.

157
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,240
Ready or not, here I come.

158
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,320
(BELL TOLLING)

159
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,720
<font color="#00ffff">Alistair was a much-valued</font>
<font color="#00ffff">colleague,</font>

160
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,160
<font color="#00ffff">held in great affection by all</font>
<font color="#00ffff">who knew him.</font>

161
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,960
Mrs Coke Norris told me that he was
due to attend a meeting here
yesterday evening.

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,320
<font color="#00ffff">Yes. Yes, indeed.</font>

163
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,280
You weren't concerned
when he didn't arrive? <font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

164
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
<font color="#00ffff">I mean, it was just...</font>

165
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,960
<font color="#00ffff">college business general</font>
<font color="#00ffff">housekeeping.</font>

166
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,720
<font color="#00ffff">How's she taken it?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Oh, as well as to be expected.</font>

167
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
Were they married long, do you know?

168
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,360
<font color="#00ffff">20 years or so.</font>

169
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,120
Happily?
<font color="#00ffff">Oh...er...</font>

170
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,520
<font color="#00ffff">Yes. Yes.</font>

171
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,160
<font color="#00ffff">There was the daughter, of course.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Audrey.</font>

172
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,680
<font color="#00ffff">I imagine that kind of thing</font>
<font color="#00ffff">must put a strain on any marriage.</font>

173
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,200
<font color="#00ffff">There was an accident,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">five or six years ago.</font>

174
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,440
<font color="#00ffff">Left her a cabbage.</font>

175
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,640
<font color="#00ffff">She's in a private hospital or</font>
<font color="#00ffff">clinic in London.</font>

176
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,520
<font color="#00ffff">They keep a flat there, I believe,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">so Millie can visit.</font>

177
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,800
I'd like to take a look
at Professor Coke Norris's rooms.

178
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,320
<font color="#00ffff">His rooms?</font>

179
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,320
Unless you've any objection.

180
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,680
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

181
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,200
<font color="#00ffff">No, no. Of course not.</font>

182
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,640
<font color="#00ffff">I just can't see what bearing his</font>
<font color="#00ffff">rooms might have on a traffic</font>
<font color="#00ffff">accident.</font>

183
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,240
It's just a question of us being
thorough in our inquiries, Master.

184
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,560
<font color="#00ff00">Something I can do for you?</font>

185
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,760
DC Morse. City police.

186
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,240
<font color="#00ff00">Oh.</font>

187
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,760
<font color="#00ff00">How do you do?</font>

188
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,400
<font color="#00ff00">Ian Kern. I'm a friend of</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Alistair's.</font>

189
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
<font color="#00ff00">I was.</font>

190
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,280
<font color="#00ff00">I lent him an old Baedeker's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">last year.</font>

191
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,120
<font color="#00ff00">Southern Italy. It had some</font>
<font color="#00ff00">sentimental value.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I didn't want it getting...</font>

192
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,320
No. Don't let me stop you.

193
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
<font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>

194
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,920
<font color="#00ff00">This is just awful.</font>

195
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
<font color="#00ff00">Awful.</font>

196
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,840
<font color="#00ff00">Is there any news as to the driver?</font>

197
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,520
Not yet, I'm afraid.

198
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,760
What was he like?

199
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,600
<font color="#00ff00">Prickly.</font>

200
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,880
<font color="#00ff00">Generous.</font>

201
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,680
<font color="#00ff00">Kind.</font>

202
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,880
<font color="#00ff00">Mostly kind.</font>

203
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,520
<font color="#00ff00">I shall miss him.</font>

204
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,040
What about Mrs Coke Norris?
What do you make to her?

205
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,960
<font color="#00ff00">Millicent likes a project.</font>

206
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,680
<font color="#00ff00">Two years ago, we had starving</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Africans.</font>

207
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,200
<font color="#00ff00">Last year, it was the plight of</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the Red Indian.</font>

208
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,160
And this?

209
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,240
<font color="#00ff00">You're looking at it, God help me.</font>

210
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,760
<font color="#00ff00">She thinks I need mothering.</font>

211
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,160
<font color="#00ff00">No outlet for the maternal instinct.</font>

212
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,960
<font color="#00ff00">Every other day, it's cakes or</font>
<font color="#00ff00">casseroles.</font>

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,480
Some might pay good money
to be cosseted like that.

214
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,960
<font color="#00ff00">Would they, though?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I don't doubt she means well,</font>

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,720
<font color="#00ff00">but if not for Alistair,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I'd have told her where to get off.</font>

216
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,960
Did he have any enemies
that you can think of?

217
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
<font color="#00ff00">Enemies?</font>

218
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,000
<font color="#00ff00">Good heavens, no.</font>

219
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,280
<font color="#00ff00">Well, not enemies, I wouldn't have</font>
<font color="#00ff00">said. </font><font color="#ffffff"> What, then?</font>

220
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,000
<font color="#00ff00">Al had been a conchie, in the last</font>
<font color="#00ff00">show. I mean, he did his bit on the</font>
<font color="#00ff00">ambulances.</font>

221
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,280
<font color="#00ff00">But some people still held it</font>
<font color="#00ff00">against him.</font>

222
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,720
<font color="#00ff00">Ah, Eureka.</font>

223
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,400
<font color="#00ff00">Well, unless there was anything</font>
<font color="#00ff00">else, I'll leave you to your um...</font>

224
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,960
<font color="#ffff00">Booth Hill? What makes you ask?</font>

225
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,280
It's come up in connection
with a case.

226
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,360
<font color="#ffff00">We've been reporting on it</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for about the last 18 months.</font>

227
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,840
<font color="#ffff00">With the Oxpens being cleared,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the council needs new housing stock.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks.</font>

228
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,120
<font color="#ffff00">The Housing Department's been in</font>
<font color="#ffff00">negotiations with Baidley College</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to acquire Booth Hill.</font>

229
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Baidley?
<font color="#ffff00">They own the land.</font>

230
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,720
<font color="#ffff00">Not been very popular</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with the Rural England brigade,</font>

231
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,720
<font color="#ffff00">but most objections have been dealt</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with, one way or another.</font>

232
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,040
<font color="#ffff00">A couple of tenant farmers</font>
<font color="#ffff00">have been 'encouraged' to move on.</font>

233
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,280
Strong arm stuff?
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing anyone will talk about.</font>

234
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,400
Any idea where a Professor Coke
Norris might fit into this?

235
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
<font color="#ffff00">None. Why? Who is he?</font>

236
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,120
He was a classics don at Baidley.
Killed in a hit-and-run last night.

237
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,760
He'd been reading your article on
Booth Hill.

238
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,320
<font color="#00ff00">One or two new faces</font>
<font color="#00ff00">hanging about recently.</font>

239
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,720
<font color="#00ff00">London types. Only, you didn't get</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that off me, right?</font>

240
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,920
<font color="#ffff00">You hear anything more on that,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you let me know. Right?</font>

241
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,680
<font color="#ffff00">Keep the change.</font>

242
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,480
<font color="#ffff00">Morse.</font>

243
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
<font color="#ffff00">Good man, Albert. Reliable.</font>

244
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,200
<font color="#ffff00">At ten bob a time, I expect he is.</font>

245
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,520
<font color="#ffff00">Any copper's only as good</font>
<font color="#ffff00">as the intelligence he gets.</font>

246
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,200
<font color="#ffff00">What do they teach you?</font>

247
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,920
I don't remember anything in Judges'
Rules about paying for information.

248
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,440
<font color="#ffff00">Got something new to think about,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">then, haven't you?</font>

249
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,640
<font color="#ffff00">Maurie. How's show business?</font>

250
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,520
<font color="#00ffff">No business like it, Mr Thursday.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Can I get you a drink?</font>

251
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,800
<font color="#ffff00">We're not stopping,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">thanks all the same.</font>

252
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,880
<font color="#ffff00">We just dropped by for a quick hello</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with Charlie, if he's about.</font>

253
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,320
<font color="#00ffff">Charlie? No, no, he's uh...</font>

254
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,000
<font color="#ffff00">Oh. We've come all this way.</font>

255
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,840
<font color="#00ffff">What time's he due, then?</font>

256
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,400
<font color="#ffff00">See, I heard he decided to call time</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on the night club business.</font>

257
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,760
<font color="#ffff00">Word is somebody gave him what for.</font>

258
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
<font color="#ffff00">Have I got that right?</font>

259
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,560
<font color="#00ffff">He's uh...signed the place over to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">me. I'm running it now.</font>

260
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,520
<font color="#ffff00">You're pulling my leg. I wouldn't</font>
<font color="#ffff00">leave you to run a whelk stall.</font>

261
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,280
20 Guards, would you, Sasha?

262
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,520
<font color="#00ffff">Straight. As God's my judge.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, but he's not, though, is he?</font>

263
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,080
<font color="#ffff00">So what do you know about</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this lorry-load of snout</font>
<font color="#ffff00">knocked off last night?</font>

264
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,400
Is there something you want?

265
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,760
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know nothing about that.</font>

266
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,280
<font color="#ffff00">Don't kid a kidder, Maurie.</font>

267
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,400
<font color="#ffff00">You're a front man.</font>

268
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,120
<font color="#ffff00">Near beer, blue jokes and totting up</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the night's take. That's your forte.</font>

269
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,280
<font color="#ffff00">So who's in the big chair now, eh?</font>

270
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,360
<font color="#00ff00">Hello, Fred.</font>

271
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,440
<font color="#ffff00">Vic.</font>

272
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,680
<font color="#00ff00">Long time.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Ain't it just.</font>

273
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,960
<font color="#ffff00">Keeping well? Family?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Mustn't grumble.</font>

274
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,080
<font color="#ffff00">What's this? Things got a bit too</font>
<font color="#ffff00">lively for you at Mile End?</font>

275
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,920

<font color="#00ff00">Owner, Mr Jolyon Frobisher.</font>

416
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,280
The Master at Baidley?
<font color="#00ff00">Hm.</font>

417
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,520
<font color="#00ff00">A piece of cake,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">this detecting lark.</font>

418
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,040
<font color="#00ff00">Don't know what you make all that</font>
<font color="#00ff00">fuss about.</font>

419
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
<font color="#ffff00">Dr Frobisher.</font>

420
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,640
<font color="#ffff00">Dorothea Frazil, Oxford Mail.</font>

421
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,160
<font color="#ffff00">I wondered if, as Master of Baidley,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you had any comment to make</font>

422
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,280
<font color="#ffff00">in response to our recent article</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on Booth Hill.</font>

423
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,200
<font color="#00ffff">On, the record, obviously,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I'm very concerned by such</font>
<font color="#00ffff">allegations.</font>

424
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,040
<font color="#ffff00">And off the record, Dr Frobisher?</font>

425
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,840
<font color="#00ffff">I think those who make</font>
<font color="#00ffff">irresponsible allegations in print</font>

426
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,440
<font color="#00ffff">should take very great care.</font>

427
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,480
<font color="#00ffff">I can't, Mr Thursday. You know that.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It's more than my life.</font>

428
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,840
<font color="#ffff00">Fair enough, Maurie. Better get him</font>
<font color="#ffff00">back, then, Sergeant Jakes.</font>

429
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,720
<font color="#00ff00">It won't look good if Kasper sees us</font>
<font color="#00ff00">dropping him off outside the</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Moonlight Rooms.</font>

430
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,640
<font color="#ffff00">Someone might take him for a grass</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and think he's been running his</font>
<font color="#ffff00">mouth</font>
<font color="#ffff00">off?</font>

431
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
<font color="#00ffff">But I ain't.</font>

432
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,160
<font color="#00ffff">Look, Vic came in, as a sleeping</font>
<font color="#00ffff">partner, with Charlie, about two</font>
<font color="#00ffff">years ago.</font>

433
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,680
<font color="#00ffff">That's all I know.</font>

434
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,000
<font color="#ffff00">Charlie was happy with that?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">You don't say no to Vic Kasper.</font>

435
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,360
<font color="#ffff00">Go on, then.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You can get the bus back.</font>

436
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,280
<font color="#00ff00">Oh. Millie. Hello.</font>

437
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,320
<font color="#ffff00">I thought the porter must have it</font>
<font color="#ffff00">wrong.</font>

438
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,720
<font color="#00ff00">The Master insisted.</font>

439
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,600
<font color="#00ff00">How are you?</font>

440
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,440
<font color="#ffff00">Rather at sixes and sevens,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'm afraid.</font>

441
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,920
<font color="#ffff00">Trying to organise the funeral but I</font>
<font color="#ffff00">imagine I'm making a hash of it.</font>

442
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,680
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, Millie.</font>

443
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,200
<font color="#00ff00">It really is too bad.</font>

444
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
<font color="#00ff00">I can't bear to see you like this.</font>

445
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,360
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I'm all right. Really.</font>

446
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,560
<font color="#00ff00">Nonsense. You've looked after me</font>
<font color="#00ff00">in so many ways.</font>

447
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,680
<font color="#00ff00">All those wonderful meals you</font>
<font color="#00ff00">prepared.</font>

448
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,600
<font color="#00ff00">So, listen, I'm going to come over</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and help tidy Al's things.</font>

449
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,080
<font color="#ffff00">His things?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">His papers.</font>

450
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,360
<font color="#00ff00">Essays.</font>

451
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,720
<font color="#00ff00">Whatever else needs taking care of.</font>

452
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,800
<font color="#00ff00">If he was anything like me, there</font>
<font color="#00ff00">may well be books from the college</font>
<font color="#00ff00">library need returning.</font>

453
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,240
<font color="#00ff00">So, how's that sound?</font>

454
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,920
<font color="#ffff00">Really?</font>

455
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,560
<font color="#ffff00">Oh... Oh, that would be most</font>
<font color="#ffff00">terribly kind.</font>

456
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,160
<font color="#00ff00">Not at all.</font>

457
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,400
<font color="#00ff00">Many hands, eh?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Two heads better than one.</font>

458
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,160
DC Morse. City police.

459
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,200
I spoke to someone on the telephone
here, an hour ago.

460
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,280
Would that have been you, Miss...?
<font color="#00ffff">Vallens. Judy.</font>

461
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,840
<font color="#00ffff">Uh, no. I've only been in</font>
<font color="#00ffff">about 20 minutes.</font>

462
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,400
Any idea why Professor Coke Norris
might have your initials and
telephone number

463
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,360
written in a matchbook,
Miss Vallens?

464
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,840
<font color="#00ffff">None.</font>

465
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,560
<font color="#00ffff">I see him every now and then at</font>
<font color="#00ffff">lectures. But that's it.</font>

466
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,920
You're a student at which college?

467
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,040
<font color="#00ffff">I'm a Matilda-beast. Lady Matilda's.</font>

468
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,760
Oh.

469
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,800
What about the matchbook?
Do you recognise that?

470
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,880
You sure about that?

471
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,200
<font color="#00ffff">Those...</font>

472
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,880
<font color="#00ffff">Uh...yes.</font>

473
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,800
<font color="#00ffff">I'm sorry. That would be</font>
<font color="#00ffff">my flatmate, Georgina Bannard.</font>

474
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,160
<font color="#00ffff">She gets them from work.</font>

475
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,800
Where's that?
<font color="#00ffff">Some club off the Broad.</font>

476
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,960
The Moonlight Rooms.
<font color="#00ffff">Mm.</font>

477
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,280
What does she do there?
<font color="#00ffff">Cigarette girl.</font>

478
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,280
Is she at home?

479
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,200
I'd like to speak with her.

480
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,360
<font color="#00ffff">When I got back from college,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">all her stuff was gone.</font>

481
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Have you roomed together long?

482
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,600
<font color="#00ffff">Eight or nine months.</font>

483
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,840
Might she have a boyfriend
she's gone to?

484
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,200
<font color="#00ffff">Nobody steady, I don't think.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">What about family?</font>

485
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,920
<font color="#00ffff">West Country somewhere?</font>

486
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,400
You wouldn't have a photograph,
by any chance?

487
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,360
<font color="#00ffff">No. Why would I?</font>

488
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,200
<font color="#00ffff">We're not close.</font>

489
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,440
You seem very nervous,
if you don't mind my saying so.

490
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,240
Is... Is there something worrying
you?

491
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,080
<font color="#00ffff">Besides coming home to find that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Gina's cleared out and landed me</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with the rent</font>

492
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,040
<font color="#00ffff">and you showing up 20 minutes later?</font>

493
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,640
Well, if...

494
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,000
If she does happen to get in touch,
could you ask her to call me?

495
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,280
She's not in any trouble. I'd just...
I'd just like to speak with her.

496
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,520
Did your husband ever talk about
a Judy Vallens?

497
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,800
She's an undergrad
at Lady Matilda's.

498
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,840
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

499
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
How about Georgina Bannard?

500
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:16,400
<font color="#ffff00">If you entertain any suspicion of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">impropriety between my husband and</font>
<font color="#ffff00">these young women,</font>

501
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,000
<font color="#ffff00">I believe I can set your mind</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at rest.</font>

502
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,040
<font color="#ffff00">After Audrey's accident...</font>

503
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,640
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, how to put it.</font>

504
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,840
<font color="#ffff00">Alistair lost all interest in, and,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">indeed, facility for physical</font>
<font color="#ffff00">intimacy.</font>

505
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
<font color="#ffff00">Completely.</font>

506
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,440
<font color="#ffff00">He used to ride to hounds, you see.</font>

507
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,800
<font color="#ffff00">When Audrey was 12, he took her out</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for the Alvescot hunt.</font>

508
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,320
<font color="#ffff00">Meant to be her blooding.</font>

509
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,880
<font color="#ffff00">Only, there was...</font>

510
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,720
<font color="#ffff00">Alistair said that a snipe broke</font>
<font color="#ffff00">cover right in front of her mount</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and she was thrown and...</font>

511
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,600
<font color="#ffff00">Al felt himself responsible,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you see.</font>

512
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,880
<font color="#ffff00">He wasn't, of course, but...</font>

513
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,720
Oh.

514
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,760
She's in some sort of clinic,
I understand. In London.

515
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,240
<font color="#ffff00">She needs constant specialist care.</font>

516
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,760
Did your husband ever mention
Booth Hill, Mrs Coke Norris?

517
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,280
<font color="#ffff00">Well, for the past year or so,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">he talked of little else.</font>

518
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,120
Really? Why? What was his interest?

519
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,640
<font color="#ffff00">Booth Hill was originally</font>
<font color="#ffff00">owned by Alistair's family.</font>

520
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,720
<font color="#ffff00">They gifted it to Baidley College</font>
<font color="#ffff00">after the Great War...</font>

521
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,160
<font color="#ffff00">as a way of avoiding death duties.</font>

522
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,080
<font color="#ffff00">Land rich, cash poor.</font>

523
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,400
So where did he stand
on this proposed development?

524
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,960
<font color="#ffff00">He felt it went against the spirit</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of the gift.</font>

525
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,800
<font color="#ffff00">Not that anyone seemed to care</font>
<font color="#ffff00">very much.</font>

526
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,200
<font color="#ffff00">Except for Ian, of course.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Ian?</font>

527
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,920
<font color="#ffff00">Dr Kern.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Ah.</font>

528
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,680
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone else was more concerned</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with what they were going to make</font>
<font color="#ffff00">out of it personally.</font>

529
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,800
<font color="#ffff00">All the senior fellows stand to gain</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a considerable windfall.</font>

530
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Including your husband?
<font color="#ffff00">Alistair wouldn't have taken it.</font>

531
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,160
<font color="#ffff00">As a point of principle.</font>

532
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,280
<font color="#ffff00">Not that I imagine Jolyon Frobisher</font>
<font color="#ffff00">will feel such an offer need be made</font>
<font color="#ffff00">now.</font>

533
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,760
The sale was formally approved,
I understand,

534
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,320
at a meeting the evening
Professor Coke Norris died.

535
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,640
<font color="#00ffff">Mm.</font>

536
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,760
That's more at stake than the general
housekeeping you led me to believe.

537
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,200
<font color="#00ffff">I said it was college business.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Which it is.</font>

538
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,200
Might the professor have carried the
day if he'd spoken against?

539
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,000
<font color="#00ffff">He would not.</font>

540
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,720
<font color="#00ffff">The land has been in college</font>
<font color="#00ffff">ownership for nearly 50 years.</font>

541
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,080
<font color="#00ffff">It's ours to dispose of</font>
<font color="#00ffff">as we think best.</font>

542
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,160
Why? Is the college short of funds?

543
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,480
<font color="#00ffff">Management of the land has been</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a constant drain on resources.</font>

544
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,200
<font color="#00ffff">The decision was as much about</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what the college stood to save by</font>
<font color="#00ffff">letting it go</font>

545
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,520
<font color="#00ffff">as about what it might gain.</font>

546
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,080
Your vehicle's been booked in the
garage with a broken windscreen.

555
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,520

it's procedure to compile a list

bodywork or windscreen repairs post

557

Well, do you have any objection

<font color="#00ff00">That's too bad.</font>

825
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,000
Yeah.
<font color="#00ff00">What did you say her name was?</font>

826
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,160
Georgina Bannard.
<font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

827
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,240
<font color="#00ff00">She called herself something else.</font>

828
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,920
<font color="#00ff00">Judy. That was it.</font>

829
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,600
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah. Judy Vallens.</font>

830
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,360
<font color="#00ff00">If it's any use.</font>

831
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,080
<font color="#00ffff">She used different names,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">depending how the mood took her.</font>

832
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,600
The mood? <font color="#00ffff">She got in with people</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when she was younger.</font>

833
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,120
<font color="#00ffff">People who took advantage.</font>

834
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,320
<font color="#00ffff">Men. You know?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Ended up with a record.</font>

835
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,000
She was a known prostitute?

836
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,440
<font color="#ffff00">Was she involved with Professor Coke</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Norris in that capacity?</font>

837
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,480
<font color="#00ffff">A while ago, she was sent to meet</font>
<font color="#00ffff">this man in a mews in Bayswater.</font>

838
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,520
Sent by whom?
<font color="#00ffff">Someone from where she worked.</font>

839
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,920
<font color="#00ffff">She had to collect a key</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from a cubbyhole at Baidley.</font>

840
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,680
Whose cubbyhole?
<font color="#00ffff">The Master's.</font>

841
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,760
Frobisher's?
<font color="#ffff00">How did you know that?</font>

842
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,360
<font color="#00ffff">Because I was with her</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when she picked it up.</font>

843
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,200
<font color="#ffff00">How was that?</font>

844
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,200
<font color="#ffff00">You were...</font>

845
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,520
<font color="#ffff00">..particular friends, would it be?</font>

846
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,640
<font color="#ffff00">You wouldn't be the first to have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">their head turned by a working girl.</font>

847
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,320
<font color="#00ffff">I went with her to London, I kept</font>
<font color="#00ffff">out of the way.</font>

848
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,360
<font color="#00ffff">And the man arrived.</font>

849
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,360
<font color="#00ffff">It turned out that he was to do with</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the Town Hall.</font>

850
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,240
<font color="#00ffff">He'd had a lot to drink and he'd</font>
<font color="#00ffff">started talking...</font>

851
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,600
<font color="#00ffff">well, bragging about some deal</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that the council had going.</font>

852
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,280
Booth Hill?

853
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,320
<font color="#00ffff">He said that he stood to make</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a packet,</font>

854
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,520
<font color="#00ffff">only there was a don at the college</font>
<font color="#00ffff">trying to stop it going through.</font>

855
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,640
<font color="#ffff00">Professor Coke Norris.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">That was the weird thing.</font>

856
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,120
<font color="#00ffff">You see, it was Coke Norris's flat</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that we were in.</font>

857
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,720
<font color="#ffff00">How could you know that?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">There were photos there...</font>

858
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,880
<font color="#00ffff">of him and his wife</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and their daughter.</font>

859
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,400
<font color="#00ffff">But from the way that this man was</font>
<font color="#00ffff">talking...</font>

860
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,240
<font color="#00ffff">..it sounded as if he had it in for</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the Professor, I mean, really had it</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in.</font>

861
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,480
You tried to warn Coke Norris?

862
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,400
You wrote your number down on a
matchbook and slipped it to him,
asked him to call. Did he?

863
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,240
<font color="#00ffff">He dropped by our flat</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on the way home from college</font>

864
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,280
<font color="#00ffff">the day that he got knocked down.</font>

865
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,960
<font color="#00ffff">I told him what I'd heard.</font>

866
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,720
<font color="#ffff00">This man from the Town Hall...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">did he have a name?</font>

867
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,280
<font color="#00ffff">Carlisle.</font>

868
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,160
<font color="#00ff00">Sexual favours?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">That's a scandalous allegation.</font>

869
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,560
<font color="#00ff00">In return for what?</font>

870
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,560
<font color="#ffff00">Making sure the purchase of Booth</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Hill from Baidley goes through</font>
<font color="#ffff00">without a hitch.</font>

871
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,960
<font color="#ffff00">And seeing the construction contract</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is awarded to the right bidder.</font>

872
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,600
<font color="#00ff00">Who is she, this girl I'm supposed</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to have been carrying on with?</font>

873
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,600
You'd have known her as
Judy Vallens.

874
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,640
Her real name is Georgina Bannard.

875
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,800
You met her in a flat in Bayswater
a couple of months ago.

876
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,080
We found her body this morning.

877
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,240
She'd been shot
in the back of the head.

878
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:14,000
<font color="#ffff00">The people you've got involved with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">are very dangerous individuals,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Mr Carlisle.</font>

879
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,600
<font color="#ffff00">I'd urge you to cooperate with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">our enquiries. We can protect you.</font>

880
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,640
<font color="#00ff00">I don't need protecting.</font>

881
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,520
<font color="#00ff00">I've done nothing wrong.</font>

882
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,560
<font color="#00ff00">Unless you're here to charge me with</font>
<font color="#00ff00">something, I've nothing else to say.</font>

883
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,960
<font color="#ffff00">I'd think about that, if I were you.</font>

884
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,400
<font color="#ffff00">A short spell inside's better than</font>
<font color="#ffff00">eternity in a wooden box.</font>

885
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,000
<font color="#ffff00">You know where to reach us</font>
<font color="#ffff00">if you change your mind.</font>

886
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,800
<font color="#ffff00">This flat of yours in London,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Mrs Coke Norris.</font>

887
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,800
<font color="#ffff00">Unless you've any objection,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'd like to send Constable Morse</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to take a look.</font>

888
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,840
<font color="#00ffff">No, of course not.</font>

889
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,400
<font color="#00ffff">But Alistair hasn't been there in</font>
<font color="#00ffff">weeks.</font>

890
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,440
<font color="#ffff00">No? When was he last there?</font>

891
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,320
<font color="#00ffff">We went to the proms in September.</font>

892
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,160
Really? What was the programme?

893
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,160
<font color="#00ffff">A Haffner and Mahler 4.</font>

894
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,200
<font color="#00ffff">Is it important?</font>

895
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,440
Only in so far as I wanted to go...
but without success.

896
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,240
<font color="#00ffff">Well, you missed out.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It was quite wonderful.</font>

897
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,560
<font color="#00ffff">We stayed up for the weekend,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">saw Audrey,</font>

898
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,240
<font color="#00ffff">caught the first train back</font>
<font color="#00ffff">early on Monday morning.</font>

899
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,480
<font color="#ffff00">How often do you visit your</font>
<font color="#ffff00">daughter? </font><font color="#00ffff"> Every week, if I can.</font>

900
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,360
On the same day each week or
different days? <font color="#00ffff">The same day.</font>

901
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,400
So someone watching your movements

902
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,280
might be able to guess
when your husband might be alone?

903
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,040
<font color="#00ffff">I suppose they could, yes.</font>

904
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,200
(TELEPHONE RINGING TONE)

905
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,680
Mrs Carter?

906
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,680
Mrs Wilkins, I see.

907
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,920
But I am right in thinking
you were a Mrs Carter?

908
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,320
<font color="#ffff00">He looked out for us after Mickey</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was killed. </font><font color="#ffffff"> Inspector Thursday?</font>

909
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,560
<font color="#ffff00">He sent me money</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at the end of each month.</font>

910
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,800
<font color="#ffff00">Right up until</font>
<font color="#ffff00">when I got married again.</font>

911
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,960
<font color="#ffff00">He'd taken Mickey under his wing,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">see.</font>

912
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
<font color="#ffff00">From a young constable.</font>

913
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,960
<font color="#ffff00">Only that night...</font>

914
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,520
<font color="#ffff00">Mickey went to see this informant</font>
<font color="#ffff00">by himself.</font>

915
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,040
<font color="#ffff00">It turned out he'd been set up.</font>

916
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,600
<font color="#ffff00">It'd have only been a beating,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">everyone said.</font>

917
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,280
<font color="#ffff00">But whoever it was went too far.</font>

918
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,360
<font color="#ffff00">Mr Thursday blamed himself.</font>

919
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,280
<font color="#ffff00">I told him there was no need</font>
<font color="#ffff00">but he wouldn't have it.</font>

920
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,200
<font color="#ffff00">Then when nobody got charged and</font>
<font color="#ffff00">they started saying what they did</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about Mickey...</font>

921
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,880
<font color="#ffff00">..things got bad.</font>

922
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
<font color="#ffff00">Fred had a young family himself.</font>

923
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,160
<font color="#ffff00">He had to look out for them,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">make sure they were kept safe.</font>

924
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,240
<font color="#00ffff">Enjoying that sandwich?</font>

925
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,480
<font color="#00ff00">It's all right.</font>

926
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,920
<font color="#00ffff">Do you come here often?</font>

927
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,440
<font color="#00ffff">Joan, ain't it?</font>

928
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,960
<font color="#00ff00">Who wants to know?</font>

929
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,840
<font color="#00ff00">You're from down the Moonlight.</font>

930
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,880
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, that's right.</font>

931
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,880
<font color="#00ffff">Vince.</font>

932
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,360
<font color="#00ffff">Can you give a little message</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to your old man for me?</font>

933
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,720
<font color="#00ffff">You tell him...</font>

934
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,480
<font color="#00ff00">If you've got something to say to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">my dad, you can tell him yourself.</font>

935
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,520
<font color="#00ff00">If you can find the guts.</font>

936
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,200
<font color="#00ff00">Ah, matey.</font>

937
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:02,520
<font color="#00ff00">That envelope you had in London,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Forensics confirms it was Coke</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Norris's handwriting.</font>

938
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,680
<font color="#00ff00">It was sent last post</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the night he died.</font>

939
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,160
Thanks.

940
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,680
<font color="#00ff00">Looks like Miss Vallens is on</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the level, sir.</font>

941
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,880
<font color="#00ff00">Georgina Bannard had a string of</font>
<font color="#00ff00">soliciting convictions to her name.</font>

942
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,600
<font color="#00ff00">I say her name truth is, she gave</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a different alias every time</font>
<font color="#00ff00">she got nicked.</font>

943
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,880
<font color="#00ff00">Marion Childs, June Buckridge,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Betty Brinker.</font>

944
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,120
<font color="#ffff00">Right.</font>

945
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,280
<font color="#ffff00">Better let Mr Bright know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">where we are.</font>

946
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,640
<font color="#00ff00">You didn't tell him...the old man?</font>

947
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,080
<font color="#00ff00">About the other night</font>
<font color="#00ff00">with Joanie at the Moonlight?</font>

948
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,360
Oh...

949
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,400
<font color="#00ff00">I would have if it was you.</font>

950
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,800
No, you wouldn't.

951
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,880
<font color="#00ff00">Look...</font>

952
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,080
<font color="#00ff00">you've got your Sergeant's coming up</font>
<font color="#00ff00">tomorrow.</font>

953
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,880
<font color="#00ff00">What if I could get you a look</font>
<font color="#00ff00">at the exam paper?</font>

954
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,840
<font color="#00ff00">If you don't pass, you'll be stuck</font>
<font color="#00ff00">on general enquiries for another</font>
<font color="#00ff00">year.</font>

955
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,440
<font color="#00ff00">Is that what you want?</font>

956
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,720
<font color="#00ff00">I'm trying to do you a favour.</font>

957
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,040
No.

958
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,200
You're trying to buy me off.

959
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
If you want to do me a favour...

960
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,240
don't mess her about.

961
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,520
All right?

962
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,560
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, that's my scrawl.</font>

963
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,360
<font color="#ffff00">I picked him up from Wolsey Gardens.</font>

964
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,600
<font color="#ffff00">Old boy, 50s, a don, I took him for.</font>

965
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,640
How come?

966
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,680
<font color="#ffff00">On account of the briefcase.</font>

967
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,840
<font color="#ffff00">I remember him cos he gave me</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a ten bob tip.</font>

968
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,440
What time was this?

969
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,960
<font color="#ffff00">Round half-seven.</font>

970
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,800
Where did you take him?

971
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,040
<font color="#ffff00">The station. Wait and return.</font>

972
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:03,200
<font color="#ffff00">I took it he must be meeting</font>
<font color="#ffff00">someone, only he wasn't in there</font>
<font color="#ffff00">five minutes.</font>

973
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,680
<font color="#00ff00">There we are, sir.</font>

974
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,200
<font color="#00ff00">Thank you very much.</font>

975
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,440
<font color="#00ff00">385.</font>

976
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,480
<font color="#00ff00">One moment.</font>

977
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
<font color="#00ff00">Here we are, sir.</font>

978
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,840
Thank you.

979
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,160
<font color="#00ffff">BRIGHT: I thought we had Professor</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Coke Norris's briefcase.</font>

980
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,400
So did whoever killed him,
but there were two.

981
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,400
The one found in the next street
to where he was run over and this.

982
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,480
<font color="#00ffff">Where did you come by it? </font><font color="#ffffff"> In the</font>
left-luggage office at the station.

983
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,240
That's what the raffle ticket was
for.

984
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,440
He got a taxi there on the way to
Baidley College.

985
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,400
<font color="#ffff00">He goes into the station with the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">first briefcase, leaves this one</font>
<font color="#ffff00">inside,</font>

986
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,400
<font color="#ffff00">then comes out carrying the same one</font>
<font color="#ffff00">he went in with no-one watching</font>
<font color="#ffff00">any the wiser.</font>

987
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,440
<font color="#00ffff">So what's in it? </font><font color="#ffffff"> I haven't had</font>
a chance to examine it in detail,

988
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,080
but it appears to be a list of
financial transactions,

989
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,640
specifically every bribe and
backhander Coke Norris was able to
uncover

990
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,640
between Baidley College
and the council.

991
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:29,160
<font color="#00ffff">The council? I thought I'd made</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Division's views on this quite</font>
<font color="#00ffff">clear?</font>

992
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,520
<font color="#ffff00">I haven't had a chance to put Morse</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in the picture as yet, sir.</font>

993
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,120
<font color="#00ffff">Let me save you the trouble.</font>

994
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:38,120
<font color="#00ffff">How the council and the college</font>
<font color="#00ffff">conduct their business is a matter</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for them.</font>

995
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,080
Even if it involves corrupt
practices?

996
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:45,160
<font color="#00ffff">You've said yourself, you don't have</font>
<font color="#00ffff">time to examine this dossier in</font>
<font color="#00ffff">detail.</font>

997
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,400
<font color="#00ffff">What at first glance may appear</font>
<font color="#00ffff">suspect</font>

998
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,600
<font color="#00ffff">might turn out on further</font>
<font color="#00ffff">examination to be quite innocent.</font>

999
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,920
I'm sure the Master at Baidley will
be able to clear up any
misunderstanding.

1000
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:58,400
<font color="#00ffff">The Master at Baidley is not to be</font>
<font color="#00ffff">troubled further and that is my</font>
<font color="#00ffff">final word on the subject!</font>

1001
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,280
Coke Norris may have been onto
something between the council
and the college,

1002
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,480
but there's nothing in here
which ties the deal up with Kasper.

1003
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,880
<font color="#ffff00">He's involved.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Don't you worry about that.</font>

1004
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,920
<font color="#ffff00">He's in it up to his neck.</font>

1005
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,960
'Hast seen the white whale?'

1006
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,920
<font color="#ffff00">My Joan say what she was doing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at the Moonlight the other night?</font>

1007
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,920
Works night out.
Girls from the bank.

1008
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,960
<font color="#ffff00">How come you were there?</font>

1009
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I was working on the case...

1010
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,120
..looking for Georgina Bannard.

1011
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,160
<font color="#ffff00">After I'd told you to steer clear?</font>

1012
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,160
Look, I don't need protecting, sir.

1013
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,200
<font color="#ffff00">Don't you?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">No.</font>

1014
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,520
I won't end up like Mickey Carter.

1015
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,560
<font color="#ffff00">What would you know about it?</font>

1016
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,320
I saw his widow.

1017
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,240
<font color="#ffff00">You did what?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Yeah, when I was in London.</font>

1018
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,040
<font color="#ffff00">Going behind my back.</font>

1019
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,920
No, sir, doing my job.

1020
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,480
<font color="#ffff00">Your job's what I say it is.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You'd no business.</font>

1021
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,520
If it has a bearing on the case,
then it is my business.

1022
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,080
You weren't gonna tell me.

1023
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,680
Was it Vic Kasper?

1024
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,280
<font color="#ffff00">Couldn't prove it.</font>

1025
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:26,920
<font color="#ffff00">Investigations started turning up</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Mickey had been on the take.</font>

1026
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,960
<font color="#ffff00">He hadn't, of course,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it was a fit-up.</font>

1027
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
<font color="#ffff00">But the brass didn't want to know.</font>

1028
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,040
<font color="#ffff00">They brushed it under the carpet.</font>

1029
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,320
You wouldn't let that go?

1030
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,880
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I let it go, all right.</font>

1031
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,120
<font color="#ffff00">To my shame.</font>

1032
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:49,160
<font color="#ffff00">I walked away and let them bury</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Mickey Carter's good name along</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with his body.</font>

1033
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,480
<font color="#ffff00">They come at you through what you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">care about.</font>

1034
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,640
That's why you moved to Oxford?

1035
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,080
<font color="#ffff00">More or less.</font>

1036
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,080
<font color="#ffff00">But this is where it stops.</font>

1037
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,520
You were right.

1038
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,720
It wasn't the Army...

1039
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,760
where I learnt to shoot.

1040
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,640
When I was 12...

1041
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,720
..the first Christmas...

1042
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,760
after my mother...

1043
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,760
..my father bought me a pistol.

1044
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,160
He used to take me out on the common
after rabbits.

1045
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,720
Make a man.

1046
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,760
(BELL CHIMES)

1047
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,080
How are you settling in?

1048
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,800
<font color="#00ff00">I've an unpleasant feeling of dead</font>
<font color="#00ff00">man's shoes.</font>

1049
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,960
<font color="#00ff00">Just boxing up the last of</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Al's stuff.</font>

1050
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,320
Do you have a minute?
<font color="#00ff00">Actually, I'm a bit pushed for time.</font>

1051
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,680
<font color="#00ff00">I said I'd take Millie</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to the undertaker's.</font>

1052
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:26,480
Have you any idea how the Master
may have come by the key

1053
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,560
to Professor Coke Norris's flat
in London?

1054
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,680
Dr Kern?

1055
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,720
<font color="#00ff00">It's just college gossip.</font>

1056
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,560
<font color="#00ff00">Some time ago, Alistair loaned</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Frobisher the key to their London</font>
<font color="#00ff00">flat.</font>

1057
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,600
<font color="#00ff00">He had some symposium to attend.</font>

1058
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,800
<font color="#00ff00">But...</font>

1059
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,600
<font color="#00ff00">..the Master took advantage</font>
<font color="#00ff00">somewhat.</font>

1060
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,000
He had a second key cut?

1061
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:56,240
<font color="#00ff00">And made it available to those</font>
<font color="#00ff00">fellows who needed a place to stay</font>
<font color="#00ff00">in London.</font>

1062
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,880
Married fellows?

1063
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,800
I suppose intimate knowledge
of his colleagues' affairs

1064
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,960
wouldn't do the Master any harm
when it came to a vote on Booth Hill.

1065
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,800
<font color="#00ff00">Blackmail, you mean?</font>

1066
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,080
It's a way of persuading any
waiverers sympathetic to Coke
Norris's cause.

1067
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,520
<font color="#00ff00">Come on, Maurie.</font>

1068
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,200
<font color="#00ff00">You're not gonna throw something</font>
<font color="#00ff00">at me again, are you?</font>

1069
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,960
<font color="#ffff00">Flag of truce. I'm offering</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a ceasefire.</font>

1070
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,720
<font color="#00ff00">What ceasefire?</font>

1071
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,360
<font color="#ffff00">48 hours head start, chance to wind</font>
<font color="#ffff00">things up and be on your way, before</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we come after you.</font>

1072
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,440
<font color="#00ff00">Come after me for what?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I told you, I'm retired.</font>

1073
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,840
<font color="#ffff00">We've got Coke Norris's briefcase,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Vic.</font>

1074
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:51,000
<font color="#ffff00">It's all there in black and white,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">every bent deal you put together</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to land the Booth Hill contract.</font>

1075
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,840
<font color="#00ff00">You been on the funny fags?</font>

1076
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,000
<font color="#ffff00">I don't want anyone else getting</font>
<font color="#ffff00">hurt.</font>

1077
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,640
<font color="#ffff00">So that's the offer.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Take it or leave it.</font>

1078
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,560
<font color="#00ff00">Can I open the box?</font>

1079
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,440
<font color="#00ff00">Serious, Fred, I don't know what</font>
<font color="#00ff00">you're talking about.</font>

1080
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,960
<font color="#00ff00">But I'll tell you this.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I'm going nowhere.</font>

1081
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
<font color="#00ffff">Your Joan not spoke to you yet?</font>

1082
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,440
<font color="#ffff00">What about my Joan?</font>

1083
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,240
<font color="#00ffff">I guess not.</font>

1084
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,160
<font color="#00ffff">She was down here the other night</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with that copper.</font>

1085
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,640
<font color="#ffff00">What copper?</font>

1086
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,640
<font color="#00ffff">That boy of yours.</font>

1087
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,680
<font color="#00ffff">Made a nice couple, I thought.</font>

1088
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,160
<font color="#ffff00">You what?</font>

1089
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,000
<font color="#ffff00">You talking about Morse?</font>

1090

You don't have to say anything

Strange.

1196
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:19,080
We'll also need you to come down the

<font color="#00ffff">Right. </font><font color="#ffff00"> And the day you came back,</font>

It would have arrived that morning.

01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,440
You knew your husband was going
to Baidley College that evening
so followed him.

1231
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:32,280
You lured him into the car
under some pretext or other.

1232
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,000
You drove him out of town
to some private place,

1233
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,880
where you stalled the car or
otherwise engineered a mechanical
fault.

1234
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,960
<font color="#ffff00">Ridiculously late.</font>

1235
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,920
You got him back into the car,
then found a quiet street in Oxford

1236
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,840
where you dumped his body to be
taken for the victim of
a hit-and-run.

1237
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,720
The squeal of brakes was
a nice touch.

1238
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,760
But you almost ruined it.

1239
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:01,160
You'd dumped his body but overlooked
his briefcase and driven back with it
to London.

1240
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,360
So you took an early train back to
Oxford and left it in the street.

1241
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,520
That's why you missed the first post.
You'd left before it arrived.

1242
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,920
<font color="#00ffff">Why would I hurt Alistair?</font>

1243
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,240
<font color="#ffff00">Because you'd become infatuated with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Ian Kern to the point of obsession.</font>

1244
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,520
In your head, you'd created
the fantasy of a future together.

1245
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:23,160
When the land sale arose, you saw
a way of financing that delusion.

1246
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:28,200
As a junior fellow, Dr Kern stood to
gain nothing from the deal but what
if he became a senior?

1247
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:31,760
<font color="#ffff00">Professor Coke Norris confided</font>
<font color="#ffff00">every detail of his campaign to you.</font>

1248
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,680
<font color="#00ffff">We were of one mind.</font>

1249
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,520
Even so, you must have been alarmed
when he told you of a pupil

1250
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:40,360
who had vital information whereby
the land sale might be derailed.

1251
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,680
You followed Judy Vallens,
found out where she lived.

1252
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,800
But you made the same error
that we did

1253
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:50,440
and mistook her flatmate,
Georgina Bannard, for Miss Vallens.

1254
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,760
You shot her in the head.

1255
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:59,040
You shot her, then returned to her
flat for her clothes to create the
impression she'd gone.

1256
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,520
<font color="#00ffff">Where's your evidence</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for any of this charade?</font>

1257
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,840
You told me the last time your
husband was in London was for a prom,

1258
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,720
the Haffner and the Mahler 4.

1259
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,560
That concert took place
on Friday 3rd September,

1260
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:13,400
the same weekend your car was in
for its annual service.

1261
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,880
The car was returned from a garage
in Mayfair on the Monday morning.

1262
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:20,160
According to you, it has been parked
outside your mews ever since.

1263
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,200
<font color="#00ffff">Right.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Right.</font>

1264
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,840
So how do you explain
the difference in mileage

1265
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:30,520
between the total written down in
the log book after its service
and its current total,

1266
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,960
a distance of 120-odd miles, roughly
that of a round trip from London
to Oxford?

1267
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,800
<font color="#ffff00">If you transported your husband in</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the car, there will be evidence</font>

1268
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,640
<font color="#ffff00">a spot of blood on the carpet,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in the crack between the seat</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and the back rest.</font>

1269
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:48,560
Mrs Coke Norris, you've killed two
people, all for some delusional
fantasy of a romance

1270
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,600
with someone
who finds your attentions oppressive.

1271
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,640
<font color="#00ffff">Ian loved me.</font>

1272
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,120
<font color="#00ffff">He did.</font>

1273
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,320
<font color="#00ffff">I know he did. He just needed time.</font>

1274
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,360
<font color="#ffff00">Perhaps you'd like to get your coat.</font>

1275
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:05,080
<font color="#00ffff">Actually, I think I should like</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to sit down for a moment.</font>

1276
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:09,240
Sir?

1277
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,360
Where's Dr Kern?

1278
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,520
<font color="#ffff00">Mrs Coke Norris?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">(SIGHS)</font>

1279
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,760
<font color="#00ffff">In the study. (NERVOUS LAUGH)</font>

1280
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,520
<font color="#00ffff">After all I'd done.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">After all I'd done.</font>

1281
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,960
<font color="#ffff00">Call an ambulance.</font>

1282
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
This is DC Morse, Oxford Police.

1283
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,240
I need an ambulance...

1284
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:07,960
<font color="#ffff00">Morse?</font>

1285
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,320
<font color="#00ff00">All right, watch yourself</font>
<font color="#00ff00">on these steps.</font>

1286
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,360
Agh!
<font color="#00ff00">Come on.</font>

1287
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,720
<font color="#ffff00">I've made as best a running repair</font>
<font color="#ffff00">as I can.</font>

1288
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,840
<font color="#ffff00">But you really need to go to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Casualty.</font>

1289
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,400
I don't have time.

1290
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,120
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

1291
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,120
The doctor said we should talk
to you.

1292
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,720
(CLOCK TICKING)

1293
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,360
(WINCES)

1294
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,080
<font color="#ffff00">Anything you need?</font>

1295
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,520
I'll be back in a few days.

1296
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:04,920
<font color="#00ffff">It's a pity you didn't come and see</font>
<font color="#00ffff">me a bit sooner.</font>

1297
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,680
<font color="#00ffff">The leg will mend,</font>

1298
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:10,400
<font color="#00ffff">but in middle-age you may well find</font>
<font color="#00ffff">yourself saddled with a limp.</font>

1299
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:14,120
<font color="#00ffff">Nothing serious, just if you're</font>
<font color="#00ffff">overtired or the weather turns.</font>
