1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,900
Divorced, beheaded, died.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,900
Divorced, beheaded, survived.

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,850
The story of Henry VIII and his six wives

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,850
is one of the best-known in history.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,850
There's Katherine of Aragon, the
bitter, abandoned first wife.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,850
Anne Boleyn, the original other woman.

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,850
Jane Seymour, bit of a doormat.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,850
Then you've got Anne of
Cleves, she was the ugly one.

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,850
Katherine Howard, the
one who slept around.

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,850
And Katherine Parr, the saintly nurse.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,900
But I'm going to tell you
a very different story.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,850
I'm going to take you back in time

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,850
and into the private lives
of Henry's six wives.

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,850
I'm going to see the story
from their point of view.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,850
And I'll watch as events unfold.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,850
The fate of my soul is
no longer your concern.

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,850
It will always be my concern.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,850
These events all really happened

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,850
and were recorded in historical
documents, or reported

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,850
by eyewitnesses.

21
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,850
I asked for his head.

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,850
Not his coat.

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,850
They reveal six complex women
who lived in a dangerous age,

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,850
as they struggle to survive
being married to Henry VIII.

25
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,900
You are still prepared to question me?

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,900
Six wives whose names were tarnished
by Henry's propaganda machine.

27
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Six Queens whose stories
I want to re-examine.

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,500
Is she here?

29
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,850
I'll observe their life at court.

30
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,850
I'll watch them romanced
by a charismatic king...

31
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,850
Tell me you want the same. Always.

32
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,850
.. who craves the company of women.

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,850
The King is a very sociable man.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,850
I have here a warrant for the
arrest of Queen Katherine.

35
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,850
I'll see how their
reputations are destroyed.

36
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,850
I beg of you to tell the king
that my heart is filled with sorrow

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,850
and assure him of my repentance.

38
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,850
And lives cut short at the hands
of a ruthless, brutal man.

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,850
Six children born.

40
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,900
Five of them dead!

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,900
This is the ultimate true story
of love, lust, and betrayal.

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,400
Remember what happened
to my last wife and queen.

43
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,850
Henry VIII's loyal first
wife Katherine of Aragon

44
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,850
tried desperately to give
the king a male heir.

45
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,850
I am afraid she has
suffered a loss of the child.

46
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,300
Get out!

47
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,850
Mary? Mother?

48
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,850
After losing five children,
she had a daughter, Mary.

49
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,850
But her failure to give him
a son angered her husband.

50
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,850
He began to look elsewhere.

51
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,850
Sent from Anne Boleyn with her
kindest regards, your Majesty.

52
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,850
Henry became infatuated with Anne Boleyn.

53
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,850
And he made her a promise that
one day she would be his queen.

54
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
The storm shall pass.

55
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,850
If she has patience enough.

56
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,850
Or the will to see it through.

57
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,850
But he already had a queen.

58
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,850
I have been a true,
humble and obedient wife.

59
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,850
Henry was determined to marry Anne.

60
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,850
But two people stood in his way.

61
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,850
The Pope, and Katherine herself...

62
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,900
who had no intention
of giving up her crown.

63
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,850
The King has been trying
to end his marriage

64
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,040
for more than two years.

65
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,850
Increasingly impatient,

66
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,850
he's now moved Anne Boleyn into
the royal palace at Greenwich,

67
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,900
forcing Katherine of Aragon to live
side-by-side with his mistress.

68
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,850
You are my one true husband.

69
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,850
You brought me here under false pretences.

70
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,850
I assumed it was to discuss
a specific legal matter.

71
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,850
Not to be caught up in this
futile, repetitious debate.

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,850
You, sir, face eternal damnation.

73
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,850
Not only of your own soul,
but all of your subjects.

74
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,850
You cannot defy the Church in this way.

75
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,850
The fate of my soul is
no longer your concern.

76
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,850
It will always be my concern.

77
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,700
You are no longer Queen. Accept this.

78
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,900
Your Majesty. My Lord.

79
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,850
How was your meeting?

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,850
Brief.

81
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,100
And the last of its kind.

82
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,850
It's 1530.

83
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,850
One of the stranger moments
in English history,

84
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,850
because the country's got two queens.

85
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,850
One of them, Katherine of Aragon,
is the crowned Queen of England,

86
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,850
and lawful wife of Henry VIII.

87
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,040
The other, Anne Boleyn.

88
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,850
No Tudor woman has been
mythologised as much as Anne Boleyn.

89
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,850
She's been accused of being a
seductress, an adulteress...

90
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,850
even a witch.

91
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,850
And because she was the other woman
in a previously happy marriage,

92
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,850
she's had a pretty harsh
press from historians.

93
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,850
It's the oldest cliche in the world.

94
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,850
A sexy young thing worming
her way into a man's heart,

95
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,900
and pushing out his loyal first wife.

96
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,850
True, Anne was clever,
and she was ambitious,

97
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,850
but she also had little choice,

98
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,850
because as soon as Henry set eyes on her,

99
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,850
he had to have her.

100
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,850
Where Anne was different
from earlier mistresses

101
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,900
is that she set the terms,
by refusing to sleep with him.

102
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,850
This only made Henry even keener.

103
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,850
He thought that Anne could give
him everything that he wanted,

104
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,850
including a son and heir,

105
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,850
which poor old Katherine
could no longer do.

106
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,850
To Henry's mind she was now
old, and past her best.

107
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,850
She may once have been his warrior queen,

108
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,850
but now she was a bitter queen,

109
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,900
standing between him and happiness.

110
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,850
Henry decided to send
Katherine away from court.

111
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,850
He moved her and their 12-year-old
daughter, Princess Mary,

112
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,770
to Windsor Castle.

113
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,850
So where was Henry?

114
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,850
Well, he was off with Anne Boleyn.

115
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,850
They were travelling about, staying
in people's houses, going hunting,

116
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,850
having dinner, acting
just like a married couple.

117
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,850
Except for the fact
they weren't having sex.

118
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,850
Now, Henry was in love with
Anne, but his subjects weren't.

119
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,850
To them, Anne was "the other woman".

120
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,850
When she appeared in public,
there was hooting and hissing,

121
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,900
and some people called her
"the King's goggle-eyed whore".

122
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,850
There's a story from round about
this time which shows just how much

123
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,850
Anne was vilified.

124
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,850
She was having dinner
down by the River Thames

125
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,850
when she was set upon
by a mob of angry women.

126
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,850
We're told that there were
between 7,000 and 8,000 of them.

127
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,850
So many that Anne had to escape by boat.

128
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,850
Now I don't think it's
particularly plausible

129
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,850
that THAT many women all went
after Anne at the same time.

130
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,900
But the story does show how much
the people of England hated her.

131
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,900
Katherine, though,
remained hugely popular.

132
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,900
Henry would need to get
rid of her for good.

133
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,850
He sent word that he and Anne
were coming to Windsor to hunt,

134
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,100
and that Katherine would
have to move again.

135
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,850
And painfully for Katherine,

136
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,900
he decided to split up
mother and daughter.

137
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,850
Katherine will never be allowed to return.

138
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,900
And what's worse, she's not allowed
to take the Princess Mary with her.

139
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,900
She will never see her daughter again.

140
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,850
The final humiliation will come

141
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,850
when Katherine is ordered to give
back the Queen's crown jewels,

142
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,900
so that Henry can give them to Anne.

143
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,850
The Queen was unceremoniously
removed from Windsor

144
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,850
and sent to the abbey at St Albans.

145
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,850
Mary was sent to Richmond Palace.

146
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,900
After 22 years of marriage, the
King didn't even say goodbye.

147
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,850
All this was calculated
to cause her maximum hurt

148
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,440
and deliberately to insult her.

149
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,850
This is something Henry did a lot.

150
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,850
He dodged problems.

151
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,850
With him, it was out
of sight, out of mind.

152
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,850
He sent Katherine into exile

153
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,850
so that he wouldn't have
to deal with her any more.

154
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,850
After all, when they had arguments
face to face, she always won.

155
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,850
She was much cleverer than he was.

156
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,900
But nevertheless, she
remained his legal wife.

157
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,850
With Katherine out of the way,

158
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,850
Anne agreed to consummate
their relationship.

159
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,850
Henry had been waiting for seven
long years for this moment.

160
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,850
And they both knew that if Anne got
pregnant, he would have to marry her

161
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,850
and make her Queen of England so
that any heir that she might produce

162
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,100
would be born legitimate.

163
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,850
However, there was still one
man standing in their way...

164
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,900
the head of the Catholic Church.

165
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,850
After more than five years,
the Pope was still refusing

166
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,970
to grant an annulment.

167
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Fortunately for Henry,
though, times were changing.

168
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,850
A religious revolution
was unfolding in Europe.

169
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,850
A rift was opening up between
the old traditional form

170
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,850
of Christianity, Catholicism,
with the Pope at its head,

171
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,850
and a new stripped-back form of
Christianity called Protestantism.

172
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,850
The clue to Protestantism
lies in its name.

173
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,850
It was originally a protest movement

174
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,900
against the excesses
of the Catholic Church.

175
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,850
Religious reformers wanted to change
the way that people worshipped God,

176
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,850
with services held in their own
native languages, not in Latin,

177
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,900
and churches led by
themselves, not by Rome.

178
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Anne was a strong supporter
of this movement for reform,

179
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,850
and Henry too began to see how
this might work in his favour.

180
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,900
He could be the head of his own church.

181
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,850
The new religion had many
practical advantages to offer him.

182
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,850
So he joined this wider
movement to cut out the Pope,

183
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,850
a movement that would allow
people to decide for themselves

184
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,850
what God wanted them to do.

185
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,900
And Henry decided that God
wanted him to leave his wife.

186
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,900
So he chose to ignore the
Pope and to marry Anne.

187
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,850
It's January the 25th, 1533.

188
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,840
And a wedding has been hastily arranged.

189
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,440
You look breathtaking, my lady.

190
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,370
Thank you.

191
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,040
We should make our way.

192
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
I can't seem to stop.

193
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
It's to be expected.

194
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,900
Particularly if the entire kingdom
harbours hatred towards me.

195
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
No. No, my lady.

196
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
The King is waiting.

197
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,850
We must go.

198
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
We must.

199
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,850
So why is Henry getting
married so secretively?

200
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,850
I'd call it furtive to do it at
dawn in such a small ceremony.

201
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,850
The answer is that if his
subjects knew what Henry was up to,

202
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,850
getting married like this
without the Pope's approval,

203
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,850
many of them would still think that
he's committing the sin of bigamy.

204
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,850
With the danger of
excommunication from the Church,

205
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,370
and the damnation of his soul.

206
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,850
But I believe Henry HAS TO marry Anne,

207
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,900
because she suspects that she's pregnant.

208
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,240
I will.

209
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,850
Henry must be hoping that,
after all this time,

210
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,900
Anne will now give him the son he craves.

211
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,850
With Henry and Anne at last married,

212
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,850
and with his bride carrying his heir...

213
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,850
he was convinced it would be a boy...

214
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,850
the King was in a celebratory mood.

215
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,850
Anne's coronation four months later

216
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,850
was as public as her
wedding had been private.

217
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,850
There was a grand procession

218
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,900
along from the Tower of
London towards Westminster.

219
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,850
Anne had her long dark hair down,

220
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,850
and just a golden coronet on her head,

221
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,850
no veil... Henry wanted people
to be able to see her face.

222
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,850
This was him saying, "This is my wife.

223
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,850
"She is your Queen.

224
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,850
"And there's nothing that the Pope

225
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,900
"or the people of England
can do about that."

226
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,850
And when she arrived at Westminster Abbey,

227
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,040
Anne was crowned Queen.

228
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,850
Huge crowds had turned
out to watch the ceremony,

229
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,970
but the mood was grim.

230
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,850
One eyewitness claims
that they showed themselves

231
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,900
as sorry as if it had been a funeral.

232
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,850
The rightful Queen had been banished.

233
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,850
Anne was a pretender.

234
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,850
It was a public scandal.

235
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,850
But most important of all, Henry
had defied the Pope to marry her.

236
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,850
And devout Catholics
up and down the country,

237
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,900
but particularly those at court,
were all blaming Anne Boleyn.

238
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,850
Yet Anne had achieved her goal.

239
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,850
She was now Queen of England,

240
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,850
but she'd also managed to make
some dangerous enemies at court.

241
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,850
What's worse, now that
she was married to Henry,

242
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,900
the power that she'd held over
him was beginning to slip away.

243
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,850
Anne's about to enter confinement
for the last month of her pregnancy,

244
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,850
and she expects Henry
to stay faithful to her

245
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,040
while she's locked away.

246
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,850
This should be the honeymoon
period of Henry and Anne's marriage.

247
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,850
But Anne's learning very quickly

248
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,900
that it's not easy being
married to King Henry VIII.

249
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,850
I'm unclear, my lady, exactly
what it is you are asking of me.

250
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,850
And I am unclear, my lord,

251
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,850
as to why it is so difficult
for you to comprehend.

252
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,850
I bestowed trust in my husband,

253
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,850
and I expect that trust to be honoured.

254
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,500
Surely, that is not unreasonable?

255
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,850
You are dissatisfied
already with me, madam?

256
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,850
Of course not.

257
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,850
I simply wish to protect our union,

258
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,850
to enter confinement in the
knowledge that you hold it

259
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,850
in the same esteem as I do.

260
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,850
For you, my dearest, so well versed

261
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,770
in respecting the sanctity of marriage.

262
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,900
A king has his needs.

263
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
But you are my queen.

264
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,850
Mother of my heir.

265
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,570
Your position is without question.

266
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,100
Then surely I deserve
your respect, my lord.

267
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,770
You are still prepared to question me?

268
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,850
If you wish to protect our union, my lady,

269
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,570
then allow me to make a suggestion.

270
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,370
Look away.

271
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,850
Now, from Henry's point of view,
this was quite straightforward.

272
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,850
He was just acting as any king should.

273
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,850
Obviously, when his wife was pregnant,

274
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,850
he should get his needs met elsewhere.

275
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,850
But Anne wasn't going to put up with this!

276
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,850
Unlike Katherine, who'd overlooked
her husband's many indiscretions.

277
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,850
After this particular argument,

278
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,900
Henry and Anne didn't speak to
each other for several days.

279
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,850
But Anne knew she had a trump
card... that baby in her belly.

280
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,850
The King's doctors and astrologers

281
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,850
were all saying it was going to be a boy.

282
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,850
This would set the seal on Henry's dynasty

283
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,040
and upon Anne's destiny.

284
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
It's September 1533, and
Anne has given birth.

285
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,900
The delivery was easy and
the child is healthy.

286
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,850
But it's another disappointment for Henry.

287
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,100
The baby is another girl.

288
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,850
This is the Princess Elizabeth.

289
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,850
Her mother, Anne, is
absolutely besotted with her.

290
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,850
Little do any of them know it,

291
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,850
but this "disappointment" will end up

292
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,850
as one of the greatest
monarchs in English history...

293
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,900
Queen Elizabeth I.

294
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,900
But Anne hadn't solved the King's problem.

295
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,850
Henry needed a boy in addition
to his two daughters...

296
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,900
Mary, from his first
marriage, and now Elizabeth.

297
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,850
The girls wouldn't be able
to continue the Tudor name,

298
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,850
and who knew if the country
would accept a female monarch?

299
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
It hadn't been tried.

300
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,900
So the pressure was now all on Anne.

301
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,850
She only needed to look north
to the bleak Fenland countryside

302
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,850
to see just how dismal her fate might be

303
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,900
if she failed to deliver a male heir.

304
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,850
Now in exile, and out of public sight,

305
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,850
Katherine was being made to suffer.

306
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,900
It would suit Henry and Anne if
something were to happen to her.

307
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,850
Henry's advisers had been constantly
moving her to more and more grim,

308
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,850
and more and more isolated residences.

309
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,850
One of them was described as "the
most pestilential house in England".

310
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,850
These places weren't healthy.

311
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,900
They'd also been slowly
getting rid of her servants.

312
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,850
Katherine was now in poor health,

313
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,850
and had been separated from Princess Mary

314
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,850
for more than two years.

315
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,850
She wrote heartfelt letters of
love and advice to her daughter,

316
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,850
who was now 17.

317
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Despite her pleading, though, Henry
refused to let them see each other.

318
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,850
But still, the people of England
hadn't forgotten Katherine.

319
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,850
During one of these moves, the road
into Cambridgeshire, 24 miles of it,

320
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,850
was lined with people who called
out her name as she passed.

321
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,900
The people of England still
remembered their Queen.

322
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,850
This is where Katherine finally ended up,

323
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,240
Kimbolton in Cambridgeshire.

324
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,850
It was rebuilt in the 18th century,

325
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,900
but it was then a
desolate medieval castle.

326
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,850
Katherine's health was deteriorating

327
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,850
in the cold and damp
at the edge of the Fens.

328
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,850
She felt besieged.

329
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,850
She became paranoid that
somebody was poisoning her food,

330
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,850
and some of her faithful ladies-in-waiting

331
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,850
were forbidden from seeing her.

332
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,850
Among them was Katherine's
oldest, closest friend,

333
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,900
her fellow Spaniard Maria De Salinas.

334
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,850
It's January 1536.

335
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,850
Am I too late? Please
tell me I am not too late.

336
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Maria has defied the King to
visit Katherine on her deathbed.

337
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,850
My Lady De Salinas. Mi senora.

338
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,640
My Lord King...

339
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,900
.. and dearest husband.

340
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,900
As the hour of my death now approaches...

341
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,240
.. I wish for you to know...

342
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,850
.. that you have...

343
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
my forgiveness.

344
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
It is my final wish.

345
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900
I ask your grace...

346
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,900
.. to forgive me also, to understand...

347
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,900
.. that my behaviour is born...

348
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,900
.. only from the grief of our separation.

349
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,370
A loss...

350
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,640
.. too great...

351
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,500
.. to endure.

352
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,370
My eyes...

353
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,900
.. long for you above all else.

354
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,370
Farewell.

355
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,850
Katherine died six days later,

356
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,900
without receiving a reply
to her final letter.

357
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,850
She was 50 years old.

358
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,850
She's been betrothed to
Henry since she was 17.

359
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,850
She dedicated her whole
life to being Queen.

360
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,850
And right to the end, she
remained immensely popular.

361
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,850
People lined the streets to watch
her coffin being carried here,

362
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,900
to Peterborough Cathedral
in Cambridgeshire.

363
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,850
The King wasn't present
at Katherine's funeral,

364
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,850
and neither was their daughter, Mary.

365
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,850
Henry refused to let her attend.

366
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,850
But the service was packed with

367
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,850
those who'd loved and respected Katherine,

368
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,900
including the ever-faithful
Maria De Salinas.

369
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,850
Even today, people leave
pomegranates on Katherine's grave,

370
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,850
the fruit from her personal emblem

371
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,900
and a reminder of her homeland in Spain.

372
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,850
A lot of people think
of Katherine of Aragon

373
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,850
as a grim-faced, angry, rejected woman,

374
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,850
but I don't think that we
should remember he like that.

375
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,900
I prefer to think of her
as a fearless warrior queen.

376
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,850
And don't forget...

377
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,900
she was also Henry's first,
and his longest-lasting love.

378
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,770
It's just days after Katherine's death.

379
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,850
Queen Anne is pregnant again.

380
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,850
This should be a time for celebration,

381
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,900
but tensions are increasing
between the Royal couple.

382
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,850
With his wife preoccupied by
the early stages of pregnancy,

383
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,370
Henry's eye is free to wander.

384
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,900
Your majesty. Madam.

385
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,850
The Queen is sleeping.

386
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,970
Should I wake her? No.

387
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,850
Then I shall come and find you,
sire, as soon as she rises.

388
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,850
There's no need.

389
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,770
I shall wait here.

390
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,900
That's if you don't object
to keeping me company?

391
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,040
It would be my pleasure.

392
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,850
The Queen has been feeling
unwell this morning.

393
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,850
Hopefully, rest will be the cure.

394
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,300
Perhaps.

395
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,850
Although she's certainly
no stranger to rest.

396
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,900
I'd like to thank you again
for my gift, your Grace.

397
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,440
It was a most unexpected thing.

398
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,700
Unexpected but...

399
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,970
.. welcome? Of course.

400
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,700
It is beautiful.

401
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,900
As is the wearer.

402
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,850
The woman sitting on the King's
knee is called Jane Seymour.

403
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,850
You might recognise her,

404
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,850
because she's one of Anne
Boleyn's ladies-in-waiting.

405
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,900
And before that, she was one
of Katherine of Aragon's.

406
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,900
My lady. How are you feeling?

407
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,850
It's almost like Henry's gone out
of his way to humiliate his wife

408
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,900
by having this brazen flirtation
with one of her servants.

409
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,850
A few days later, Anne
miscarried her child.

410
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,850
When Henry discovered, he was
too angry to speak about it,

411
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,850
and there was one report that he
said scarcely anything to her,

412
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,850
except that he clearly saw that God

413
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,850
did not wish to give him male children.

414
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,850
I believe that this is the
point at which Henry began

415
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,900
to turn against his wife.

416
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,850
The spell was broken for Anne.

417
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,850
Her power over Henry was ebbing away,

418
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,850
and Anne sensed this.

419
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,850
The reason she'd had the
miscarriage, she told the King,

420
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,850
is because she was upset.

421
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,900
Her heart broke, she said, when
she saw that he loved others.

422
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,850
After just three years
of marriage to Henry,

423
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,850
Anne now had a rival.

424
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,850
Jane Seymour was young and attractive,

425
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,900
and unlike Anne, she seemed
compliant and respectful.

426
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,850
But the real reason why
Jane was such a threat

427
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,850
was because she'd been
deliberately placed before the King

428
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,100
by Anne Boleyn's enemies.

429
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,850
The court was a hotbed
of different factions,

430
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,850
all of them competing for
the attention of the King.

431
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,850
One lot were the religious reformers...

432
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,850
they were very keen on
Henry's new church in England.

433
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,850
But opposing them were the
religious conservatives.

434
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,850
This lot were still
secretly loyal to the Pope,

435
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,850
and they would've been very glad
to see the back of Anne Boleyn.

436
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,850
But they had their own
secret weapon... Jane Seymour.

437
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,850
They coached her in how to
attract Henry's attention,

438
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,850
and it worked.

439
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,900
Henry seemed to be
falling in love with Jane.

440
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,370
It must be agonising for Anne.

441
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,850
She's watching a love affair unfolding

442
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,850
between Jane Seymour and her own
husband before her very eyes.

443
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,850
Ironically, she's in
exactly the same position

444
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,850
as Katherine of Aragon
had been before her.

445
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,850
Anne is feeling vulnerable and nervous,

446
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,900
and nervousness makes
people do strange things.

447
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,700
So, Sir Henry...

448
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,850
.. have you proposed
marriage to my cousin yet?

449
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,850
Not yet, your Grace.

450
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,850
Poor Lady Margaret.

451
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,850
I have no ill feeling towards her.

452
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,850
I simply wish to... bide my time a little.

453
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,700
Such a gentleman.

454
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,850
Do you know what I think, Sir Henry?

455
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,900
No, my lady. But I feel
sure you're about to tell me.

456
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,850
I think you look for dead men's shoes.

457
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,900
A rich widow? You think me so shallow?

458
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,040
Not just any rich widow.

459
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,240
What I mean to say is this.

460
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,900
That if something were to happen
to the King, you'd look to marry me.

461
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,850
Am I right?

462
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,850
Madam, I'm sure that if ever I
were to have even such a thought,

463
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,850
that I would be in grave
danger of losing my head.

464
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,900
Well, remember, I could certainly
make that happen if I so wished it.

465
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,850
I'm teasing you, sir!

466
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,850
Then perhaps we should concern ourselves

467
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,850
with less gruesome thoughts and
return to the celebrations.

468
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,700
A very wise idea.

469
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,850
Anne should know that, at the Tudor court,

470
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,900
conversations like this don't
stay private for very long.

471
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,850
The man Anne was talking
to was called Henry Norris,

472
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,850
and he was one of the King's most
trusted and intimate confidants.

473
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,850
Now, to talk about the
King's death was treason.

474
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,850
For Anne to talk about the King's
death to the King's closest friend

475
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,850
and then to suggest that
they might get married,

476
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,900
well, that seems absolutely bonkers.

477
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,850
So why did Anne do it?

478
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,850
Was she arrogant enough to think
that she could get away with it?

479
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,900
Or was she really desperate
to feel desired once again?

480
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,850
I think the answer is neither.

481
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,850
I think the really unfair thing is

482
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,850
that Anne was only acting in accordance

483
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,850
with the Code of Chivalry.

484
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,850
This was a way of behaving
with which Henry was obsessed,

485
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,850
and according to chivalry
a queen, or a noble lady,

486
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,850
was supposed to behave
kindly and graciously

487
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,850
and flirtatiously to humble young knights.

488
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,850
So by flirting with Henry Norris,

489
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,850
Anne was only fulfilling
her job description.

490
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,850
The only thing I'll concede

491
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,900
is that maybe fear made her go too far.

492
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,850
Whatever her reasons,
Anne's ill-judged remark

493
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,570
would have enormous repercussions.

494
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,850
By the next day, everybody
at court had heard

495
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,850
what Anne was supposed to have said...

496
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,900
including the King.

497
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,850
Rumours were flying about that Anne

498
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,850
had been having this
affair with Henry Norris,

499
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,850
but also with other courtiers too.

500
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,900
It was even said that she'd been
sleeping with her own brother.

501
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,850
No matter how preposterous the claims,

502
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,850
Anne's enemies fuelled the rumours,

503
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,850
and it suited Henry to believe them.

504
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,850
He was now obsessed with Jane Seymour,

505
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,100
and he wanted to get
rid of his second wife.

506
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,850
My lord, my lord.

507
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,850
Pernicious gossip... can you not see that?

508
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,850
I cannot see everything.

509
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,850
And that is why I employ
the greatest trust

510
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,850
in those I keep close to me.

511
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,850
And who closer than me?

512
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,850
Those who have served me for
nearly their entire lifetimes.

513
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,850
I am your loyal wife, my lord.

514
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,850
Does that count for nothing?

515
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,850
I could not do anything to
hurt or discredit you, I swear.

516
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,850
My loyal wife...

517
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,570
and trusted companion, Sir Henry...

518
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,850
.. in each other's arms.

519
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,850
Lies! Witnessed by others.

520
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,850
Good men who have neither
reason nor inclination

521
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,850
to fabricate nonsense.

522
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,850
How could I jeopardise all that
I have for so long desired?

523
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,850
Only you hold the answer to that question.

524
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,850
Just think of our child.

525
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,300
My lord.

526
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,850
How long we have waited to be together.

527
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,850
You should heed your own advice, madam.

528
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,850
I do, my lord.

529
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,850
And I would no more slight you than
I would harm a hair on the head

530
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,500
of our sweet daughter, Elizabeth.

531
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,840
Think of her, sire.

532
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,170
Sire.

533
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,040
I wish you to leave now.

534
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,850
But if my lord could give me
a few precious minutes more,

535
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,850
then I could...

536
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,900
Leave, or I shall have
you dragged from here.

537
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,850
Even after this really
horrible confrontation,

538
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,850
Anne must still have had hopes
of salvaging her relationship.

539
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,850
The very next day she attended
the May Day tournament,

540
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,850
just as if nothing was wrong.

541
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,900
And, in fact, this would be her
last public appearance as Queen.

542
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,850
As the King was riding
away from the joust,

543
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,850
he went with Henry Norris,

544
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,850
and he questioned him closely

545
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,850
about what he might have
been up to with his wife.

546
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,850
Henry Norris denied all
wrongdoing, but nevertheless,

547
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,850
he was arrested and sent to the Tower.

548
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,900
And the King's men were
coming for Anne too.

549
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,850
The following day, after three
tempestuous years of marriage,

550
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,850
Anne was arrested.

551
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,850
She was taken by boat from Greenwich,

552
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,900
up the river to the Tower of London.

553
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,900
Henry didn't see her again, either
to confront her, or say goodbye.

554
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,850
Just as he had with Katherine of Aragon,

555
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,900
he let other people do his dirty work.

556
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,850
Anne was accused of treason,

557
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,850
and of committing adultery
with five male courtiers,

558
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,570
including her own brother, George.

559
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,850
Anne was frightened about where
exactly they were taking her.

560
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,850
"Shall I go into a dungeon?" she asked.

561
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,850
But the guard said no,

562
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,850
they were taking her
to the Royal apartments,

563
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,850
where she'd stayed the night
before her own coronation.

564
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,850
When she heard this,
Anne cried with relief.

565
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,850
"It is too good for me," she said.

566
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,850
"Jesus have mercy upon me."

567
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,900
It's at this point that we
begin to see Anne's terror.

568
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,850
Anne's own servants were dismissed,

569
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,850
and she was given five
new ladies-in-waiting.

570
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,850
But really, they were spies.

571
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,850
Every single word that Anne
said was fed back to the King.

572
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,850
The ladies reported that
Anne was growing hysterical,

573
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,850
sometimes crying, sometimes laughing.

574
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,850
She even made a joke that
history would know her

575
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,900
as Queen Anne the Headless.

576
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,850
The five accused men,

577
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,850
including her brother and Henry Norris,

578
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,900
were quickly found guilty and executed.

579
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,850
Anne has also been found guilty.

580
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,900
Of treason.

581
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,240
And the punishment is death.

582
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,850
But, for me, there's a
compelling piece of evidence

583
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,850
that points to her innocence.

584
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,850
Anne has asked to see a priest,

585
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,900
Thomas Cranmer, the
Archbishop of Canterbury.

586
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,900
You wish to take the holy
sacrament of confession, my Lady?

587
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,900
My Lord God.

588
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,850
I am heartily sorry for
having offended you.

589
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,850
I detest all of my sins

590
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,850
because I fear the loss of
heaven, and the pains of hell.

591
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,850
But most of all, because I offend you,

592
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,850
my God,

593
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,200
who is all good, and
deserving of all my love.

594
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,850
But I kneel before you now
to protest my innocence

595
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,240
of the crimes I am accused.

596
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,100
I have ever been a
faithful wife to the King.

597
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,850
Though I do not say I have
always shown him that humility

598
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,170
that his goodness merited.

599
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,850
I confess that I have had jealous fancies

600
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,850
and suspicions of him that I had
not discretion nor wisdom to conceal

601
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,900
at all times.

602
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,850
But as for my brother...

603
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,770
and those others unjustly condemned...

604
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,900
.. I shall willingly accompany them
into heaven with this assurance.

605
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,850
That I shall lead an endless
life with them in peace and joy,

606
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,900
where I shall pray to God for the King.

607
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,570
May the Lord have mercy on my soul.

608
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,900
This is everything you wish to say?

609
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,850
God knows, and is my witness

610
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,900
that I have not sinned
against him in any other way.

611
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,850
Anne believes, all Tudor people believe,

612
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,850
that if she tells a lie in confession,

613
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,900
she damns her soul to eternal torment.

614
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,850
So when she says she's innocent,
in those extreme circumstances,

615
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,440
I think we have to believe her.

616
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,850
Anne's husband, Henry,
had loved her so much

617
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,850
that he changed a country's
religion so that he could have her.

618
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,850
But now he's tired,
he's frustrated by her.

619
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,850
Anne's real crime is to have
failed to give the King a son,

620
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,900
and to have become difficult to live with.

621
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,170
That's why she has to die.

622
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,900
All this for so little a neck.

623
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,850
Anne Boleyn's beheading
on the 19th of May 1536

624
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,900
was the first execution of
a queen in English history.

625
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,900
The country shed few tears for
Anne, and her enemies rejoiced.

626
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,850
Her body was brought to the small chapel

627
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,700
that lies within the Tower of London.

628
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,850
This is where Anne is buried.

629
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,850
She really has been one of history's
most controversial figures.

630
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,850
For much of the last 500 years, she
has been vilified as a schemer,

631
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,850
a predator, even as a witch.

632
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,850
But from the vantage point
of the 21st century,

633
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,850
it looks very different.

634
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,850
She seems like one of us.

635
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,850
She used wit and willpower
to get what she wanted.

636
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,850
At first, this worked very well for Anne.

637
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,850
But ultimately, the Tudor court

638
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,900
was a dangerous place to
be for an ambitious woman.

639
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,850
In the end, she was the
victim of her own strength,

640
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,900
as well as the victim
of the pitiless King.

641
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,850
As soon as he received the
news of Anne's execution,

642
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,850
Henry went off to see Jane.

643
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,850
And 11 days later, he married her,

644
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,850
his third Queen, at Whitehall Palace.

645
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,850
He didn't waste any time, did he?

646
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,900
Preparations for the wedding had
begun even before Anne was dead.

647
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,900
Jane was 27 and a devout Catholic.

648
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,850
Her family and her Catholic supporters

649
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,850
hoped she might steer Henry
back to the old religion,

650
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,850
but I think Jane decided
to take a different approach

651
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,850
now she was Queen.

652
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,850
And here's the clue.

653
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,900
The motto she chose was
"bound to obey and serve".

654
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,850
Jane Seymour was your
typical English rose.

655
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,850
Just look at her pale skin,
the strawberry-blonde hair,

656
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,850
her lovely rosy cheeks.

657
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,400
But English roses aren't
very exciting, are they?

658
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,850
And Jane's pale appearance does
seem matched by her pale character.

659
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,850
She's curiously passive,

660
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,850
and I think that this
was a clever choice...

661
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,850
to be the absolute polar
opposite of Anne Boleyn,

662
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,850
who was a bit too
exciting for her own good.

663
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,850
I think I might do exactly the same thing

664
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,850
if I were married to Henry VIII...

665
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,850
to pretend to be meek and
mild, even if I wasn't,

666
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,900
so as not to annoy him, and to stay alive.

667
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,850
After so much upheaval,

668
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,900
a period of calm descended
upon the Royal household.

669
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,850
Importantly, Jane was a peacemaker.

670
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,850
She improved Henry's
relationship with his children.

671
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,850
For a long time, he'd been
estranged from his daughter, Mary.

672
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,850
Mary was now 20,

673
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,850
and Henry had even made
her sign a piece of paper

674
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,850
saying that her own mother's marriage

675
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,850
had been incestuous and unlawful.

676
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:21,850
But now, in 1536, Jane persuaded
Henry to meet Mary once again.

677
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,850
So Henry's family life, for
once, was going smoothly.

678
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,850
But meanwhile, out in the country,

679
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:34,850
a great big wave of political and
religious change was about to break.

680
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,850
And this was the moment

681
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,900
when Jane's obedience to
the King would be tested.

682
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,850
England was a country divided,

683
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,850
split between the new
reformers and the Catholics.

684
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,850
Hundreds of monasteries,
all around the country,

685
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,100
kept the old faith alive.

686
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,850
To Henry and his advisers,

687
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,850
these monasteries represented
a challenge to his authority.

688
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,770
They were still answerable to the Pope.

689
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,850
Also, they were fantastically wealthy.

690
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,850
Henry had fought a lot of wars,
he'd built a lot of palaces,

691
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,850
he was short of cash.

692
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,240
Hmmm...

693
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,850
In 1536, the King ordered
that they be pulled down,

694
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,850
and their assets seized.

695
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,850
For many people, this destruction
felt like a sort of apocalypse.

696
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,850
It destroyed the fabric of their world.

697
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,850
And the dissolution of the
monasteries led to rebellion.

698
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,850
One particular rebellion,
called the Pilgrimage of Grace,

699
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,850
started in the East Midlands.

700
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,850
It spread to the north

701
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,900
and it culminated with a
bloody uprising in York.

702
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,850
Jane's stepdaughters, Mary and Elizabeth,

703
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,850
were brought back to the court in London

704
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,850
to avoid them getting
caught up in the uprising.

705
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,850
Mary, in particular, was in danger,

706
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,850
because, as the daughter of

707
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,850
the staunchly Catholic
Katherine of Aragon,

708
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,850
the rebels would have loved
to use her as a figurehead.

709
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,700
Henry was determined to prevent this.

710
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,850
The religious tension playing
out across the country

711
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,900
is also being felt
within the palace walls.

712
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,850
Princess Mary has just returned to court

713
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,850
under the protective
wing of her stepmother.

714
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,850
She has to tread carefully
around her father,

715
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,900
who she barely knows.

716
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:40,850
What have you been doing today?

717
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,900
Tell me. Riding, sir.

718
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,850
Some needlework. A little music.

719
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,900
Pardon? Music, sir.

720
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:50,850
The lute.

721
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,900
Very good. Mary is
extremely gifted, my lord.

722
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,850
Almost a match for her father.

723
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,850
Is she now? You must play for me again.

724
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,850
It's been a long time.

725
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,850
Of course.

726
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,900
It would be a pleasant distraction
from the foolishness in York.

727
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,850
I've heard talk at court.

728
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,850
These men wish to see us slaughtered.

729
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,570
They are churchmen, not murderers.

730
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,850
They are simply protesting.

731
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,100
You sympathise with them?

732
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,850
I can understand their
allegiance to their faith.

733
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,900
They are much attached to
their monasteries in the north.

734
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,040
You do sympathise, then?

735
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,770
My concerns are for you alone, my lord.

736
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,570
For your soul.

737
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,100
If I upset you, sire,
then I beg your pardon.

738
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,850
I only wish to offer my counsel
as your devoted wife and queen.

739
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,000
And so I would urge you
to tread carefully.

740
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,400
Remember what happened
to my last wife and queen.

741
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,850
What Jane was doing was fulfilling

742
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,850
another of these recognisable
roles of a Tudor Queen.

743
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:16,850
In this case, asking for mercy
on behalf of the powerless.

744
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,850
Jane also thought it was here
duty as a devout Catholic

745
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,850
to petition the King for
a cause she believed in.

746
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,850
Although this was a brave thing to do,

747
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,850
Jane was wise to back off when she saw

748
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,850
that she'd pushed the King too far.

749
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,850
But she did do absolutely everything
else that Henry asked of her,

750
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,900
including the most important thing of all.

751
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,850
On the 12th of October
1537, after a long labour

752
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,850
lasting two days and three nights,

753
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,900
Jane gave birth.

754
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:57,850
It was a boy.

755
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,850
Henry had a healthy,
legitimate son at last.

756
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,850
It had taken him three
wives to get to this point.

757
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,850
Three days later, baby Prince Edward,

758
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,850
this new hope of the Tudor dynasty,

759
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,900
was christened here in the
Chapel Royal at Hampton Court.

760
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,850
It's 12 days since the
birth of Prince Edward,

761
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,640
and the nation is still celebrating.

762
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,900
But Jane is taking longer
than expected to recover.

763
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,440
Somebody fetch more cold water.

764
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,700
Can you hear me?

765
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,840
You are still here.

766
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,700
My sweet lady, where else would I be?

767
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,700
Where is our son?

768
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,640
He is thriving?

769
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,500
Very much so.

770
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,840
A more contented child I've yet to meet.

771
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,900
He must know how much
his mother loved him.

772
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,240
You will tell him, my lord.

773
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,850
I do not give up hope that
you may tell him yourself.

774
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,900
Many times.

775
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,900
Lord God, why must you punish me this way?

776
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,850
Jane Seymour never recovered
from the infection she contracted

777
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,900
after the long and difficult
birth of Prince Edward.

778
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:40,900
She died on the 24th of October 1537.

779
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,850
Henry genuinely grieved for Jane.

780
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,850
He wrote about his bitterness,

781
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,850
and it was said that he
retired to a solitary place

782
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:54,850
to see to his sorrows.

783
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,850
Jane had been the perfect wife for him.

784
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,850
She hadn't bothered him.

785
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,850
She'd given him what he wanted, a son.

786
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,850
Who knows what would have happened next,

787
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,850
because they had only
been married for 16 months.

788
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,900
There's a sense that he hadn't
had time to get bored of her.

789
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,850
To me, Jane Seymour was a
queen who played a canny hand.

790
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,850
By acting exactly like the
wife that Henry wanted,

791
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,900
she became his most-loved queen.

792
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,850
When Henry died, he chose
to be buried alongside her,

793
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,900
here in St George's Chapel, Windsor.

794
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,850
But that wouldn't be for some time yet.

795
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,900
Henry still had three wives to go.

796
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,850
The ageing and increasingly
overweight King

797
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,640
will struggle to find a fourth wife.

798
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,850
And a blind date will prove a disaster.

799
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,850
History will forever judge
this Queen on her looks,

800
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,850
ignoring her gift for diplomacy

801
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,850
that will make her one of
England's richest women.

802
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,440
A nice tight grip on the shaft.

803
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:20,850
Madam, this is an outrage.

804
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,900
Ambassador Haas, this is King Henry.

805
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:26,850
Oh, very good.

806
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,850
And the 50-year-old King's relationship

807
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,850
with a teenage lady-in-waiting

808
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,900
will lead to lurid tales
of adultery and treachery.

809
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,850
I thought you were one of the King's men.

810
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,850
I am. His Majesty's most
loyal and faithful servant.

811
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,850
And I'll reveal that this will be

812
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,850
the most disturbing story of them all.

813
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,850
Did you lie with Dereham?

814
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,900
Yes, my lord. I see.

815
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,840
The choice to lie with him was not mine.

816
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,570
I was a child.
