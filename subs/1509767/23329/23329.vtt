1
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:50,133
The war for freedom continues

2
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:53,758
whilst heroic deeds are done
throughout our territory.

3
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:59,467
Our magnificent loyalist militia
have expelled the fascists from Madrid.

4
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:05,508
The defeated totalitarians head north
with the aid of the enemies of freedom:

5
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:08,050
The Italian fascists and German Nazis,

6
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:11,217
aiming to attack
the impenetrable North Democratic Belt.

7
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:15,383
From the Basque Country barricades,
tireless militia will defend democracy,

8
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:17,800
prepared to sweat blood.

9
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,592
A frightened Franco
seeks help from Hitler

10
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:24,092
and his Condor Legion,
led by Von Richthofen,

11
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:26,217
cousin of the Red Baron himself.

12
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:33,175
To stop them, the Soviet Union has sent
their bravest to fight for democracy

13
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:38,300
on the battlefield
with a message of death to the fascists.

14
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:45,675
We will not allow fascist fallacies
to poison our spirit.

15
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,967
We won the battle in Madrid.
We shall win!

16
00:04:57,008 --> 00:05:00,508
Hey, what are you doing?
I was transmitting my article.

17
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,425
I work for a French newspaper.

18
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,300
You know the rules.

19
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,883
If you tell your paper
we're losing the war, we cut you off.

20
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,050
It's better than canceling your permit

21
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:14,508
or arresting you, which we can also do.

22
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,050
Please...

23
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,883
- I'm just trying to do my job.
- So am I.

24
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:25,008
Carmen, I want a copy of his articles
one hour before transmission.

25
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:39,258
It's the first time
he's been sent as a journalist.

26
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,092
How are you feeling?

27
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,508
You don't look too good.

28
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:47,508
I didn't sleep well.

29
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,758
I've a lot on my mind.

30
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:54,300
Vasyl is waiting for you in his office.
Go on.

31
00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:20,508
You'll pay for it.
Hit him, hit him.

32
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,050
- What's going on?
- He'll be hanged.

33
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:33,675
- He's lucky if that's all.
- His plane was shot down.

34
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:36,467
He's one of the German bomber pilots.

35
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:30,217
Wait, sir!
Wait! Do you want an apple?

36
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,883
Thank you!

37
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:36,842
They have snipers.
They've shot two of our men.

38
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,258
We'll rescue them.

39
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,050
Come back here!

40
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,300
Don't do that! It's dangerous!

41
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:45,717
Help me.

42
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,050
Please.

43
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:52,467
Help!

44
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:53,717
That picture is important.
Publish it.

45
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,467
Together.

46
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:06,550
Absolute perfection.

47
00:22:15,758 --> 00:22:17,050
Thank you.

48
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:49,342
Gentlemen, your results!

49
00:22:49,425 --> 00:22:52,883
Thomas is first with 16 hits,
Matthias is second with 12

50
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:55,217
and Wolfgang is third with 9.

51
00:22:55,425 --> 00:23:00,133
So this week's bonus is for Thomas Selber.

52
00:23:00,717 --> 00:23:03,300
Are you saving up
for the wedding or a house?

53
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:06,592
No, I came here to buy this truck.

54
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:10,508
- These Spanish girls would be cheaper.
- Attention!

55
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:18,592
Lieutenant Colonel Von Richthofen!

56
00:23:18,883 --> 00:23:20,258
Stand to attention!

57
00:23:22,258 --> 00:23:27,883
Discipline.
Gentlemen, discipline!

58
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,550
We have lost men through pilot error.

59
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:38,175
One was saved by his parachute,
but he was taken to Bilbao.

60
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,967
Two others died in a car accident

61
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:46,217
coming back
from one of those parties.

62
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,508
Don't forget,

63
00:23:49,092 --> 00:23:51,300
we lost the Great War

64
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:55,758
but today might be our second chance.

65
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:35,467
Yes.

66
00:24:53,383 --> 00:24:55,550
- Does anyone know how to fix a car?
- Yes.

67
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:55,675
Thank you, Nicolie.

68
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,092
Exactly.

69
00:30:08,717 --> 00:30:09,883
Come on.

70
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,758
Thank you.

71
00:31:30,258 --> 00:31:34,050
- Where's the journalist from Madrid?
- No idea, he's always late.

72
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:35,425
Let's go.

73
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:40,883
I'll come up shortly.

74
00:34:34,383 --> 00:34:38,175
- Morning, my Lieutenant Colonel.
- Good morning, Wolfgang.

75
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:41,092
Berlin wants
better air and land coordination.

76
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,592
With the Spanish? Impossible.

77
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:47,717
The engine is fine but check piston two.

78
00:34:49,508 --> 00:34:52,383
The Spanish aren't the only ones,
Wolfgang.

79
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:56,383
The Italians are pretty much the same.

80
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:58,633
We learn something new every day.

81
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,592
Meanwhile our men are holding out
against syphilis and diarrhea.

82
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:09,092
Minister GÃ¶ring wants to bomb a city
as a birthday present to Hitler.

83
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:11,550
Fine.
It's a nice present for our FÃ¼hrer.

84
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:14,925
He will see
what the German Air Force is capable of.

85
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,758
- Hello.
- Hello.

86
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:03,092
Hi.

87
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,592
Shit!

88
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:20,550
- You'd better go home, it's late.
- Right away. See you tomorrow.

89
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,217
They must stay with the group.

90
00:42:18,217 --> 00:42:20,883
And you'd better be careful.

91
00:42:21,258 --> 00:42:22,550
I owe you one.

92
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:41,842
Why are you here?

93
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,383
You know you're not welcome.

94
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:46,550
Go away!

95
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:48,717
Are you driving us out? You?

96
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,717
When my son returns,

97
00:42:52,008 --> 00:42:54,050
you'll be the one to be driven out!

98
00:42:54,342 --> 00:42:59,217
We all know which side your son fights on.
On the fascists' side!

99
00:42:59,717 --> 00:43:00,800
Leave it!

100
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,342
I won't sell you anything.
No beetroots,

101
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,050
no leeks, no carrots,

102
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:06,592
no cauliflowers. Nothing!

103
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:09,425
You'll change your mind
when ours come along,

104
00:43:09,925 --> 00:43:11,175
when it's too late!

105
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:13,092
- Are you sure?
- Come on.

106
00:43:41,925 --> 00:43:45,133
We are 35 kilometers away from the front.

107
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:48,675
It's about to break.

108
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:52,925
The Spanish have asked us
to attack with full force.

109
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,717
They will retreat through the mountains,
along that road.

110
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:59,550
Franco wants to stop them here.

111
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:03,842
He'd better make sure we get the ammo
and the fuel we were promised.

112
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:07,217
They must make sure our bills are paid.

113
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:09,717
I've spoken with General Mola.

114
00:44:10,092 --> 00:44:14,300
He wants us to bomb
all of the Basque factories.

115
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,717
Really? His own factories?

116
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,508
The Spanish don't think about the future.

117
00:44:20,342 --> 00:44:22,925
Soon there will be no tomorrow for them.

118
00:45:46,633 --> 00:45:50,133
Teresa! What a joy!

119
00:45:51,592 --> 00:45:53,133
It's been so long.

120
00:46:03,217 --> 00:46:04,425
Nice girl!

121
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,133
This is Henry, Marco and Marta.

122
00:46:08,342 --> 00:46:11,050
- Foreign reporters.
- Welcome.

123
00:46:11,925 --> 00:46:14,175
Look at you, you look exhausted.

124
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,717
Auntie...

125
00:46:16,217 --> 00:46:17,425
She doesn't sleep.

126
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,633
- She's too sensitive for this job.
- Stop it.

127
00:46:21,008 --> 00:46:22,883
It's none of their business.

128
00:46:23,092 --> 00:46:26,050
Answering back,
just like she did with her father.

129
00:46:32,258 --> 00:46:33,258
Teresa!

130
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:35,217
Isabel.

131
00:46:38,592 --> 00:46:40,217
What a surprise!

132
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:42,175
You look lovely.

133
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:50,092
What a joy!
Just in time to see my wedding dress.

134
00:46:50,342 --> 00:46:51,383
Yes.

135
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,592
- What did he say?
- Congratulations.

136
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,217
Thank you.

137
00:47:03,258 --> 00:47:04,383
A photograph.

138
00:47:04,717 --> 00:47:06,217
- Yes.
- Yes?

139
00:47:12,217 --> 00:47:15,925
That's uncle's car.
It's always broken down.

140
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,425
I'll show you my dress.

141
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:30,633
Hello?

142
00:47:34,383 --> 00:47:36,717
- American?
- Yes, American.

143
00:47:36,925 --> 00:47:38,550
If you want to buy me a new car.

144
00:47:38,842 --> 00:47:39,883
Not good...

145
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,592
It's the carburetor.
It wouldn't happen with a Spanish car.

146
00:47:45,842 --> 00:47:50,092
Bad times for everyone.
We're better here than in the city.

147
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:53,342
We grow vegetables
and exchange things with neighbors.

148
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,092
But in Bilbao...

149
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:05,383
We need it,
our daughter is getting married

150
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,550
and we'll have to visit her.

151
00:48:08,008 --> 00:48:10,717
Or if we have to leave here in a hurry.

152
00:48:12,508 --> 00:48:15,675
Is it better to send BegoÃ±a
and my daughter to Bilbao?

153
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,508
If I were you,
I'd leave as soon as possible.

154
00:48:51,883 --> 00:48:53,217
God, help me!

155
00:52:27,217 --> 00:52:29,342
It's Teresa, as a child.

156
00:52:31,092 --> 00:52:34,217
Her father, a football player.

157
00:52:34,258 --> 00:52:38,467
Football!
Ferocious, like Teresa.

158
00:52:49,383 --> 00:52:50,675
Do you like it?

159
00:52:52,217 --> 00:52:53,550
I drew it myself.

160
00:52:54,717 --> 00:52:56,342
It's at the dressmaker's.

161
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:00,050
My boyfriend hasn't seen it yet,
he's at the front.

162
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:01,758
I wanted a man's opinion.

163
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,925
Very pretty.

164
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,550
Really?
Do you think it's pretty?

165
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,425
Very, very pretty.

166
00:53:18,508 --> 00:53:21,175
Come on. Lunch is ready!

167
00:53:23,383 --> 00:53:26,175
Yes, we agree to the plan.

168
00:53:28,342 --> 00:53:32,467
Please,
inform Franco that after the operation

169
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,467
he must advance quickly to Bilbao

170
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:38,675
or he will miss a golden opportunity.

171
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,717
The General always advances slowly,

172
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,842
he prefers to shoot his enemies
house by house.

173
00:53:45,508 --> 00:53:48,883
Yes, but delays cost money.

174
00:53:49,508 --> 00:53:51,883
There's no Republican aviation
in the area.

175
00:53:52,008 --> 00:53:55,550
They only have one plane in Bilbao
and it's being repaired.

176
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,342
Splendid.

177
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:02,967
- Where's the ten of hearts?
- Here you are.

178
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,842
No, it hasn't come up.

179
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:06,008
Thank you.

180
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,092
Perhaps she has it.

181
00:54:10,592 --> 00:54:11,633
It's magic.

182
00:54:23,883 --> 00:54:24,883
A toast!

183
00:54:26,008 --> 00:54:28,300
For the magician!
American, cheers!

184
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,258
Uncle will play a song.
I hope you like it.

185
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:42,758
- Yes!
- We can dance, if someone teaches me.

186
00:54:46,175 --> 00:54:48,342
- Can I?
- Yes.

187
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,133
Let's see.

188
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:58,217
- I've no idea.
- It's very easy.

189
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,217
Go, go!

190
00:59:32,467 --> 00:59:33,717
Gentlemen,

191
00:59:33,842 --> 00:59:35,258
thermite!

192
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,717
In just a few seconds, it reaches 1,000Â°C

193
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,050
and melts anything
it comes into contact with.

194
00:59:50,883 --> 00:59:52,717
During the 8 minutes it burns,

195
00:59:52,758 --> 00:59:56,258
it can't be put out with water nor sand.

196
00:59:56,717 --> 01:00:00,842
First, we shall bomb
their water supply systems,

197
01:00:01,842 --> 01:00:03,967
so they cannot put out any fire.

198
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:07,217
Then we'll incinerate
everything with thermite.

199
01:00:07,383 --> 01:00:09,592
German efficiency at its best:

200
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:12,967
Minimum intervention,
maximum destruction!

201
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:19,258
Hold it! Don't move! Hands up!

202
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:37,842
- Do you know something?
- No.

203
01:12:13,425 --> 01:12:15,383
APPROVED

204
01:13:27,092 --> 01:13:28,258
You're wrong.

205
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:44,300
The sacrifices we've made in Spain,

206
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,383
the savings on ammunition and fuel

207
01:13:47,842 --> 01:13:49,508
have not been in vain.

208
01:13:51,883 --> 01:13:54,217
They've been talking about it
in Berlin for months.

209
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:58,883
A three-day air raid
carried out in just one afternoon.

210
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,842
As fast as lightning.

211
01:14:01,467 --> 01:14:05,050
We've received orders
to put it into practice

212
01:14:05,092 --> 01:14:07,217
during our attack today.

213
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,342
Therefore, gentlemen...

214
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,300
enjoy your flight...

215
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:14,883
to Gernika.

216
01:17:07,883 --> 01:17:09,508
A magnificent day.

217
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:13,717
Ideal for a drive along the beach,
don't you think?

218
01:18:01,758 --> 01:18:03,092
Good luck, boys!

219
01:18:03,717 --> 01:18:04,717
Everything will be OK!

220
01:18:21,383 --> 01:18:23,050
Take your clothes off!

221
01:18:23,842 --> 01:18:26,633
- No.
- Undress!

222
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,883
It's lovely, how much is it?

223
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:13,050
We have to go to the shelter!
Come on!

224
01:22:30,383 --> 01:22:32,300
Isabel! Where are you going?

225
01:22:32,383 --> 01:22:33,425
To the tailor's!

226
01:22:33,508 --> 01:22:36,675
- Have you gone mad?
- My wedding dress!

227
01:22:36,758 --> 01:22:38,300
Come back!

228
01:22:43,967 --> 01:22:47,717
Planes!
Get to the shelter! Come on!

229
01:22:47,883 --> 01:22:49,050
To the shelter!

230
01:22:50,717 --> 01:22:52,217
To the shelter! Come on!

231
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:56,758
Quickly!

232
01:23:05,342 --> 01:23:07,758
Let's go to the bomb shelter.
Take him!

233
01:23:07,842 --> 01:23:10,883
No, no, no!

234
01:23:34,758 --> 01:23:36,550
Come on! Hurry up!

235
01:23:50,633 --> 01:23:53,258
To the bomb shelter! Hurry up!

236
01:23:54,508 --> 01:23:55,675
Come on!

237
01:23:55,967 --> 01:23:57,342
To the City Hall!

238
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,842
To the shelter! Come on!

239
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:05,217
Leave that!
Go to the City Hall shelter.

240
01:24:05,467 --> 01:24:06,592
My car!

241
01:24:16,925 --> 01:24:18,092
Hurry up!

242
01:24:53,217 --> 01:24:54,883
- I need your help.
- Over there!

243
01:25:03,258 --> 01:25:05,383
My dress! It's my dress!

244
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:07,550
Help me.

245
01:25:07,883 --> 01:25:09,217
Help, I've no strength!

246
01:25:40,342 --> 01:25:42,925
Teresa. Yes, come on, let's go.

247
01:26:01,258 --> 01:26:03,050
Bastards!

248
01:26:03,383 --> 01:26:05,967
Bastards!

249
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:16,217
Come on, let's go to the shelter.

250
01:26:21,883 --> 01:26:24,217
- Cheka?
- Go with him!

251
01:26:24,842 --> 01:26:26,175
Young lady, don't!

252
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:38,800
Let's go.

253
01:26:48,508 --> 01:26:50,883
The Italian Legionary Air Force
awaits orders.

254
01:26:50,967 --> 01:26:53,425
The three Italian SMs
are awaiting orders.

255
01:26:53,633 --> 01:26:54,925
This way!

256
01:26:55,717 --> 01:26:57,592
Freeze!
This is a restricted area!

257
01:26:57,842 --> 01:27:00,967
- Open the damn door! The mayor sent us!
- You've no jurisdiction here!

258
01:27:28,217 --> 01:27:29,383
Stop!

259
01:27:30,217 --> 01:27:31,550
Why are you here?

260
01:27:32,758 --> 01:27:33,883
Get out! Get out!

261
01:27:35,092 --> 01:27:36,292
- Drop the gun, boy!
- Drop it.

262
01:27:36,383 --> 01:27:37,925
I have orders to shoot!

263
01:27:47,842 --> 01:27:49,050
Help!

264
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:51,842
Help! Please!

265
01:27:53,342 --> 01:27:55,133
Open the door, please! Help!

266
01:27:55,633 --> 01:27:58,300
Let us out! Let us out, please!

267
01:27:58,758 --> 01:28:00,758
Please, let us out.

268
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:03,717
Get the keys! On the wall!

269
01:28:09,967 --> 01:28:11,550
Get out!

270
01:28:12,133 --> 01:28:14,050
Come on, let's go!

271
01:30:09,008 --> 01:30:10,383
Planes again!

272
01:30:12,717 --> 01:30:15,133
- Murderers!
- Run, they're coming back!

273
01:30:45,342 --> 01:30:48,133
- Open up!
- You can't come in, it's full.

274
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,883
You can't come in.
You can't come in.

275
01:30:59,883 --> 01:31:02,300
- Have you seen my mum?
- Don't worry. She's coming.

276
01:31:02,467 --> 01:31:04,383
- And my dad?
- Yes, don't worry.

277
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:08,717
- My God!
- It hurts.

278
01:31:08,842 --> 01:31:11,383
Don't worry, calm down. Look.

279
01:31:11,717 --> 01:31:15,300
Bite this, okay?
Bite it hard so your eardrums don't burst.

280
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,383
I've got enough for everyone.
Bite it.

281
01:31:19,425 --> 01:31:21,842
Bite it hard. Good, bite it.

282
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:24,383
Little guy!
Bite it, that's it, hard!

283
01:31:28,133 --> 01:31:31,175
- And for me?
- Wait, I think I've got another.

284
01:31:31,342 --> 01:31:33,633
- Will this do?
- Yes, perfect.

285
01:31:33,758 --> 01:31:35,800
- Thank you.
- There, bite it hard.

286
01:32:23,592 --> 01:32:25,133
Go with your side.

287
01:32:42,883 --> 01:32:44,758
Sit down.

288
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:02,508
Don't look. Shut your eyes.

289
01:34:02,842 --> 01:34:06,217
- What happened to them?
- Nothing, they're asleep.

290
01:35:11,883 --> 01:35:13,342
Help!

291
01:37:10,258 --> 01:37:11,258
Sorry.

292
01:37:14,342 --> 01:37:17,467
There's nothing I can do.
I'm so sorry.

293
01:41:36,508 --> 01:41:37,883
Stop!

294
01:41:45,342 --> 01:41:47,050
Don't move!

295
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:49,717
One more step and I'll shoot.

296
01:42:08,842 --> 01:42:10,508
Whatever they need.
