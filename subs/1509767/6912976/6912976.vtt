1
00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:54.384
It is the dawn of the 17th century.

2
00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:58.221
After the assassination of his father,

3
00:00:58.306 --> 00:01:01.683
the young King Louis XIII
ascends to the French throne.

4
00:01:03.728 --> 00:01:07.481
His once peaceful nation
is surrounded by enemies on all sides.

5
00:01:10.777 --> 00:01:14.696
Within the borders of France itself,
Cardinal Richelieu, the King's advisor,

6
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:17.365
plots in secret to seize power for himself.

7
00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:21.078
The inexperienced Louis
and his new bride, Queen Anne,

8
00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:23.246
find themselves without a single friend.

9
00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:26.208
Europe is a powder keg waiting to explode

10
00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:28.919
in a war that will engulf
the entire continent.

11
00:01:29.796 --> 00:01:33.090
And only a few men
can prevent the coming apocalypse.

12
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:34.985
Move out!

13
00:02:38.614 --> 00:02:39.698
Halt!

14
00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:03.096
Don't.

15
00:03:03.764 --> 00:03:04.890
Getting careless?

16
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.517
The feeling is mutual.

17
00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:18.612
For future reference, "I love you"
would have been a more suitable reply.

18
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.950
Could have just said, "Hello."

19
00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:25.994
What would be the fun in that?

20
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.788
- How was the bishop?
- Not as good as you.

21
00:03:29.332 --> 00:03:30.707
You are incorrigible.

22
00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:34.127
I bet you say that to all the girls.

23
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.841
But, sir! Remember I am a lady!

24
00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:41.051
Let me touch your bosom.

25
00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:42.802
Sir, keep your hands to yourself!

26
00:03:43.804 --> 00:03:46.514
Hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come,

27
00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:49.809
thy will be done, on earth
as it is in heaven.

28
00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:51.686
Give us this day our daily bread,

29
00:03:52.063 --> 00:03:53.647
and forgive us our trespasses,

30
00:03:53.731 --> 00:03:56.316
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

31
00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:57.359
Amen.

32
00:04:02.198 --> 00:04:04.032
That's enough wine, I can assure...

33
00:04:19.548 --> 00:04:21.466
- What?
- Key.

34
00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:31.810
You mean this key?

35
00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:42.529
Who are you?

36
00:04:49.203 --> 00:04:51.913
- I'm not a priest.
- I'm not really a lady.

37
00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.373
I have 1 0 minutes.

38
00:04:55.793 --> 00:04:58.795
♪ There once was an aunt from Lorraine.

39
00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.048
♪ With an incredible tolerance for pain.

40
00:05:02.091 --> 00:05:06.261
♪ She had a nasty habit
♪ Involving a chicken, a frog, and a rabbit

41
00:05:06.345 --> 00:05:09.222
I expected more
from a man of your reputation.

42
00:05:10.516 --> 00:05:14.352
I don't suppose you have any idea
where I could find Athos and Aramis?

43
00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.898
Never heard of them.

44
00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:24.571
You French spies.
You're very, very arrogant. And foolish.

45
00:05:24.655 --> 00:05:25.780
And you're so...

46
00:05:25.865 --> 00:05:27.240
Sexy?

47
00:05:28.075 --> 00:05:29.951
Lt's a wonder it took me so long
to catch you.

48
00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:31.619
You didn't!

49
00:05:31.746 --> 00:05:32.787
I beg your pardon?

50
00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:36.750
You didn't catch me.

51
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.377
And what exactly are you doing here?

52
00:05:40.004 --> 00:05:41.129
Catching you.

53
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.110
Key.

54
00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:09.949
Vive la France!

55
00:06:11.827 --> 00:06:13.453
Da Vinci's Vault.

56
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:17.957
Leonardo designed it to protect
the plans of his greatest inventions.

57
00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:27.133
Shall we?

58
00:06:32.932 --> 00:06:33.973
Now.

59
00:06:52.535 --> 00:06:55.453
Your part's done. Why don't you stay back?
We'll meet at the rally point.

60
00:06:56.163 --> 00:06:57.330
We came together,

61
00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:00.333
we leave together.

62
00:07:22.648 --> 00:07:23.648
I'll go.

63
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:25.066
Wait, wait.

64
00:07:25.734 --> 00:07:26.901
Too easy.

65
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.881
- Pressure plates under the floor.
- Oh!

66
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.717
- I could scale the walls.
- Run a cable along the roof.

67
00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:53.052
- Could be booby-trapped, too.
- Hmm.

68
00:08:19.997 --> 00:08:22.415
Well? We don't have all night.

69
00:08:24.168 --> 00:08:27.086
You're absolutely certain
there are no hidden passages?

70
00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:28.254
And no secret tunnels?

71
00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:30.089
Positive, sir. lt's a vault.

72
00:08:30.174 --> 00:08:31.633
One way in, one way out.

73
00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:35.929
Excellent! I want these Musketeers dead!
I want them dead!

74
00:08:35.971 --> 00:08:38.515
The guards change in two minutes,
maybe less.

75
00:08:39.517 --> 00:08:40.517
Less!

76
00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:46.773
What now?

77
00:08:46.857 --> 00:08:48.733
- C'est la vie?
- No.

78
00:08:49.818 --> 00:08:50.985
Contingency plan.

79
00:08:54.114 --> 00:08:55.448
Got it.

80
00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:05.792
Athos, you do know what's up there?

81
00:09:05.834 --> 00:09:07.585
Just hold your breath.

82
00:09:23.644 --> 00:09:24.811
Get out!

83
00:09:24.853 --> 00:09:27.522
Hey! Get back down there! Now!

84
00:09:39.952 --> 00:09:41.452
Go ahead, say it!

85
00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:42.495
I love you.

86
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.875
I hate to ruin the mood,
but perhaps we could go elsewhere?

87
00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:51.004
You know, for once I think
the padre may be right.

88
00:09:57.386 --> 00:09:58.469
All for one.

89
00:09:58.846 --> 00:10:00.138
And one for all.

90
00:10:04.393 --> 00:10:05.518
So, what's next?

91
00:10:05.853 --> 00:10:07.270
Back to Paris, I guess.

92
00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:08.688
And then what?

93
00:10:08.856 --> 00:10:11.190
Wherever they send us,
whatever France needs.

94
00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:13.359
Lt's who we are. lt's what we do.

95
00:10:15.654 --> 00:10:17.071
I do love you.

96
00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:18.323
I know.

97
00:10:18.657 --> 00:10:21.993
Then please try and understand
that this isn't personal.

98
00:10:22.036 --> 00:10:24.162
Lt's strictly business.

99
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:27.373
He made me a better offer.

100
00:10:36.342 --> 00:10:38.051
Ah! Athos.

101
00:10:38.677 --> 00:10:39.844
Buckingham.

102
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:50.521
A toxin.

103
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.071
In case you were wondering, it wasn't
in your drink, it was on your cup.

104
00:10:58.197 --> 00:11:01.741
Inactive until it came into contact
with the liquid.

105
00:11:05.079 --> 00:11:06.746
Don't worry.

106
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.749
Lt isn't fatal.

107
00:11:11.293 --> 00:11:14.128
Although I suspect
a part of you wishes it was.

108
00:11:15.381 --> 00:11:18.383
You take all the risk and I get the reward.

109
00:11:19.093 --> 00:11:20.927
Hardly seems fair.

110
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.806
Well, just so you don't leave empty-handed,

111
00:11:24.932 --> 00:11:26.641
a word of advice.

112
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.565
Trust no one, especially women.

113
00:11:36.485 --> 00:11:38.069
You'll live longer.

114
00:11:45.244 --> 00:11:49.247
Telling him you loved him
right before you betrayed him.

115
00:11:50.124 --> 00:11:54.460
I must say, that was cruel,
even by my standards.

116
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.172
I only took away his prize.

117
00:11:58.507 --> 00:12:00.800
You took a lot more than that.

118
00:12:10.477 --> 00:12:13.855
At last, the war machine.

119
00:12:55.147 --> 00:12:56.355
Look down.

120
00:12:57.733 --> 00:13:00.526
Lt's a trick an old friend taught me.

121
00:13:01.403 --> 00:13:05.323
Your adversary will not always be
as noble as you.

122
00:13:05.991 --> 00:13:07.366
Remember that,

123
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.369
and I have nothing left to teach you.

124
00:13:10.496 --> 00:13:11.537
I doubt that, Father.

125
00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:15.875
Keep it.

126
00:13:16.877 --> 00:13:20.755
Lt's passed down from generation
to generation, from father to son.

127
00:13:20.881 --> 00:13:22.381
Lt's yours now.

128
00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:29.096
The weapon of a Musketeer.

129
00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:31.557
The real weapon of a Musketeer

130
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:33.601
is here.

131
00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:35.770
All for one.

132
00:13:35.938 --> 00:13:37.563
And one for all.

133
00:13:38.357 --> 00:13:39.857
You remind me of somebody.

134
00:13:40.025 --> 00:13:41.984
Let me guess. You.

135
00:13:42.486 --> 00:13:46.572
No, no.
The man I wish I was when I was your age.

136
00:13:48.408 --> 00:13:51.327
Well, you should really be on your way.

137
00:13:52.329 --> 00:13:56.749
Take this purse. There's 1 5 crowns in it.
Lt's enough to get you to Paris.

138
00:13:56.959 --> 00:14:01.254
And you'll need a mount.
Your mother's insisting you take Buttercup.

139
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:04.257
- I know it's not much, and...
- It's plenty.

140
00:14:09.596 --> 00:14:12.974
Take care of yourself, my son.
Try not to get into any fights.

141
00:14:13.058 --> 00:14:17.436
If I'm to be a Musketeer, I think I might
have to do a little bit of fighting.

142
00:14:17.521 --> 00:14:19.605
Stay at the back if you can.

143
00:14:19.773 --> 00:14:21.315
Yes, Mother.

144
00:14:21.775 --> 00:14:25.444
- There's one more piece of advice.
- I know, I know. Don't get into any trouble.

145
00:14:25.529 --> 00:14:26.779
Wrong.

146
00:14:26.822 --> 00:14:28.322
Get into trouble.

147
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:30.241
Make mistakes.

148
00:14:31.368 --> 00:14:34.161
Fight, love, live.

149
00:14:36.164 --> 00:14:41.127
And remember, always,
you're a Gascon and our son.

150
00:14:44.214 --> 00:14:46.173
Now go. Go.

151
00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:27.214
In the name of God,
what kind of beast is that?

152
00:15:27.716 --> 00:15:30.176
And the beast he's riding
doesn't look much either.

153
00:15:30.344 --> 00:15:31.636
- Ostler.
- Sir?

154
00:15:31.803 --> 00:15:33.971
- Please see that my horse is watered and fed.
- Oh!

155
00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:35.890
Lt's a horse, is it?

156
00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:38.351
My friends here thought it was a cow.

157
00:15:41.063 --> 00:15:42.313
Excuse me.

158
00:15:43.523 --> 00:15:45.858
See, I know you men
are just kidding around.

159
00:15:46.485 --> 00:15:47.610
Buttercup,

160
00:15:48.612 --> 00:15:51.072
well, she gets a little sensitive.

161
00:15:52.532 --> 00:15:54.617
I'm afraid I must ask you to apologize.

162
00:15:55.619 --> 00:15:59.205
Well, I'm afraid I'm not in the habit
of apologizing to Gascon yokels.

163
00:15:59.706 --> 00:16:01.082
Not to me.

164
00:16:01.917 --> 00:16:03.167
To my horse.

165
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.172
You've hurt her feelings.

166
00:16:11.551 --> 00:16:13.135
And if I don't?

167
00:16:13.762 --> 00:16:15.346
I shall have to kill you.

168
00:16:26.984 --> 00:16:28.192
You shot me!

169
00:16:28.527 --> 00:16:30.736
Most observant of you, young man.

170
00:16:30.904 --> 00:16:33.739
But the real question is,
why are you not dead?

171
00:16:35.242 --> 00:16:36.701
Flesh wound.

172
00:16:37.077 --> 00:16:40.079
Sight must be off.
Who takes care of my pistols?

173
00:16:40.372 --> 00:16:41.872
Captain Rochefort, I...

174
00:16:45.585 --> 00:16:46.919
Whoa, whoa, steady.

175
00:16:47.087 --> 00:16:49.046
Wouldn't want to dirty my blade
with peasant blood.

176
00:16:50.549 --> 00:16:51.757
So, boy,

177
00:16:52.175 --> 00:16:53.718
consider this a lesson.

178
00:16:53.885 --> 00:16:54.885
Your last.

179
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.430
No.

180
00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:03.561
He's too pretty for that.

181
00:17:05.188 --> 00:17:07.064
As you wish, Milady.

182
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:10.943
Rochefort, come.

183
00:17:11.153 --> 00:17:13.070
We're expected in Paris.

184
00:17:13.238 --> 00:17:14.447
Thank you.

185
00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.277
Make way!

186
00:18:42.244 --> 00:18:43.869
I think you've had enough.

187
00:18:46.164 --> 00:18:47.248
Where's my tankard?

188
00:18:48.416 --> 00:18:49.875
Excuse me!

189
00:18:52.546 --> 00:18:53.879
You think you're better than me?

190
00:18:54.047 --> 00:18:55.548
No.

191
00:18:55.632 --> 00:18:57.133
Watch yourself, boy!

192
00:18:57.384 --> 00:18:59.135
All for one.

193
00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:01.178
Excuse me!

194
00:19:02.222 --> 00:19:04.140
- Sorry! I'm sorry!
- Are you blind?

195
00:19:04.307 --> 00:19:06.225
Look, I'm chasing after a man
who insulted my horse

196
00:19:06.309 --> 00:19:07.518
and tried to kill me, so let me go!

197
00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:10.229
That's not good enough.
You spilled my drink and ruined my shirt.

198
00:19:10.438 --> 00:19:11.814
I'm in a hurry.

199
00:19:14.693 --> 00:19:16.902
- Here.
- 1 0 sous?

200
00:19:17.237 --> 00:19:20.364
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- The town drunk, from the smell of you.

201
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.867
Now that, my boy, is fighting talk.

202
00:19:24.411 --> 00:19:26.996
- What are you saying exactly?
- Blind and deaf.

203
00:19:27.706 --> 00:19:29.373
Fortunately for you,
I'm somewhat of a doctor.

204
00:19:29.457 --> 00:19:31.250
Great! When can you fit me in?

205
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.003
12:00, Cooper's Yard, St. Germain.

206
00:19:34.087 --> 00:19:35.254
I'll be there.

207
00:19:38.258 --> 00:19:39.258
Excuse me!

208
00:19:39.342 --> 00:19:41.302
I just can't decide.

209
00:19:41.386 --> 00:19:45.723
Well, if I might point out,
this does make you look very dignified,

210
00:19:45.807 --> 00:19:49.101
whereas the blue one
brings out your dashing side.

211
00:19:49.227 --> 00:19:50.811
Equally important.

212
00:19:51.771 --> 00:19:54.315
Dignified. Dashing.

213
00:19:54.941 --> 00:19:58.110
In the words of King
Solomon, I'll take both!

214
00:19:58.236 --> 00:20:00.237
A most excellent choice, sir.

215
00:20:02.949 --> 00:20:04.617
Darling, you spoil me.

216
00:20:04.701 --> 00:20:06.952
I don't know how I shall ever repay you.

217
00:20:07.704 --> 00:20:09.705
- Watch yourself!
- My apologies.

218
00:20:10.123 --> 00:20:12.499
Matter of life and death. Won't happen
again. Believe you dropped this.

219
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.960
This isn't mine.

220
00:20:15.045 --> 00:20:16.712
I saw the lady hand this to you,
I'm not blind.

221
00:20:16.963 --> 00:20:19.673
Are you implying that
I take money from this woman?

222
00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:22.301
Are you saying that I cannot afford to pay
for my own wardrobe?

223
00:20:22.385 --> 00:20:24.845
Do you know who I am?

224
00:20:25.013 --> 00:20:26.055
No!

225
00:20:26.139 --> 00:20:27.473
Then we're even.

226
00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:31.310
You're in luck, boy.

227
00:20:31.478 --> 00:20:35.481
Ordinarily, I would slaughter you on the
spot, but this is a brand-new jacket.

228
00:20:36.316 --> 00:20:38.859
Cooper's Yard, St. Germain, 1:00.

229
00:20:39.402 --> 00:20:41.403
I suggest you dress for a funeral!

230
00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:42.905
What?

231
00:20:53.166 --> 00:20:55.584
- Lottery!
- There you go.

232
00:20:55.835 --> 00:20:58.087
Lottery ticket, sir?
Might be your lucky day!

233
00:21:04.552 --> 00:21:05.844
What the hell?

234
00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.013
5 francs?

235
00:21:09.057 --> 00:21:10.140
Hey! Hey!

236
00:21:11.184 --> 00:21:12.393
What is this?

237
00:21:12.936 --> 00:21:14.353
Lt's a citation.

238
00:21:15.855 --> 00:21:17.189
Lt's a ticket.

239
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.359
Failure to remove animal bowel movements
from public area.

240
00:21:20.443 --> 00:21:21.527
French.

241
00:21:22.237 --> 00:21:24.947
Your horse took a dump on the street.

242
00:21:26.283 --> 00:21:27.366
You're joking.

243
00:21:28.285 --> 00:21:29.910
That's what they all say.

244
00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.870
You know what?

245
00:21:34.874 --> 00:21:37.626
Cooper's Yard, St. Germain, 2:00.

246
00:21:41.798 --> 00:21:43.048
Strange boy.

247
00:22:04.237 --> 00:22:05.237
Milady de Winter!

248
00:22:23.465 --> 00:22:25.007
Close game, Your Eminence.

249
00:22:25.467 --> 00:22:26.842
- Hmm.
- Who's the opponent?

250
00:22:26.926 --> 00:22:30.262
Myself. No one else proved to be
a sufficient challenge.

251
00:22:36.978 --> 00:22:38.103
Hmm.

252
00:22:38.396 --> 00:22:39.438
What news of England?

253
00:22:40.482 --> 00:22:41.940
He's coming.

254
00:22:42.734 --> 00:22:43.942
- Buckingham?
- Hmm.

255
00:22:44.944 --> 00:22:45.944
And...

256
00:22:46.321 --> 00:22:47.321
And?

257
00:22:48.948 --> 00:22:50.324
He built it.

258
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.242
The war machine.

259
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:54.036
And he doesn't question your loyalty.

260
00:22:54.996 --> 00:22:57.247
He thinks he's so cunning.

261
00:22:57.957 --> 00:22:59.416
So evil.

262
00:22:59.751 --> 00:23:01.460
Evil is just a point of view.

263
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.712
Ah!

264
00:23:03.797 --> 00:23:04.797
Richelieu.

265
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:11.929
Is this lady the emissary from England?

266
00:23:12.097 --> 00:23:14.264
Your Majesty is exceptionally alert.

267
00:23:16.643 --> 00:23:18.811
So, madam,

268
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.064
what of Buckingham?

269
00:23:23.817 --> 00:23:24.817
Majesty?

270
00:23:24.901 --> 00:23:26.985
Well, what's he wearing these days?

271
00:23:28.988 --> 00:23:30.697
Green, Your Majesty.

272
00:23:31.991 --> 00:23:33.492
- Green?
- Hmm.

273
00:23:33.993 --> 00:23:35.702
Very interesting.

274
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.830
And you had the gall to recommend blue?

275
00:23:39.207 --> 00:23:40.332
Of course it should be green.

276
00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:44.545
Why am I surrounded
by incompetent idiots?

277
00:23:46.172 --> 00:23:47.965
Green, green, green!

278
00:23:48.007 --> 00:23:50.300
Do I have to do everything myself?

279
00:24:01.563 --> 00:24:02.604
Ah!

280
00:24:02.689 --> 00:24:05.732
There you are. Shall we get to it?

281
00:24:06.192 --> 00:24:08.527
So, are you eager
to meet your maker?

282
00:24:08.778 --> 00:24:10.070
I have other appointments.

283
00:24:10.363 --> 00:24:11.780
You'll miss them, I'm afraid.

284
00:24:12.031 --> 00:24:14.241
Well, I'll try my best to be on time.

285
00:24:14.951 --> 00:24:16.076
My seconds.

286
00:24:16.244 --> 00:24:17.244
You!

287
00:24:18.037 --> 00:24:19.079
You're fighting this rascal?

288
00:24:20.874 --> 00:24:22.541
My appointments.

289
00:24:23.042 --> 00:24:25.544
1:00. 2:00.

290
00:24:27.755 --> 00:24:29.089
How long have you been in Paris?

291
00:24:29.257 --> 00:24:31.133
- Arrived this morning.
- You have been busy.

292
00:24:31.885 --> 00:24:34.386
Patience is not one of my virtues.

293
00:24:34.512 --> 00:24:35.679
Well, neither are good manners.

294
00:24:36.306 --> 00:24:38.056
Wait for your turn, old man.

295
00:24:40.643 --> 00:24:43.812
What would you like me to put
on your headstone? "Little shit"?

296
00:24:44.647 --> 00:24:47.816
D'Artagnan.

297
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.152
I'm Athos.

298
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.904
This is Porthos and Aramis.

299
00:24:53.573 --> 00:24:56.283
The Three Musketeers.

300
00:24:56.743 --> 00:24:57.743
I've heard of you.

301
00:24:58.786 --> 00:25:02.414
From my father, a Musketeer himself.

302
00:25:02.582 --> 00:25:04.333
In fact, I came to Paris to be one of you.

303
00:25:04.417 --> 00:25:05.834
I'm afraid you're a little late.

304
00:25:06.586 --> 00:25:07.628
What happened?

305
00:25:07.712 --> 00:25:09.922
Oh, a bad mission. Budget cuts.

306
00:25:10.465 --> 00:25:11.840
Cardinal, progress.

307
00:25:12.008 --> 00:25:13.300
Take your pick.

308
00:25:14.844 --> 00:25:17.471
Well, then, welcome to Paris.

309
00:25:17.639 --> 00:25:19.264
Pity we'll have to kill you.

310
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.978
Well, if I can't become a Musketeer,
I might as well fight one.

311
00:25:25.146 --> 00:25:26.522
Or three.

312
00:25:27.315 --> 00:25:30.526
Kill him already.
Lt's lunchtime and I'm starving.

313
00:25:41.246 --> 00:25:42.246
Halt!

314
00:25:45.458 --> 00:25:46.458
Jussac.

315
00:25:47.252 --> 00:25:51.255
Well, well, well.
How the mighty have fallen.

316
00:25:51.422 --> 00:25:53.423
Dueling in defiance of the edicts?

317
00:25:54.217 --> 00:25:56.718
You got tired of rolling peddlers
for spare change?

318
00:25:58.137 --> 00:25:59.972
- Now...
- Seal the square!

319
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.934
Surrender your weapons
and come along with us.

320
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.060
Seal it off!

321
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.730
Unless, of course, you would rather resist.

322
00:26:08.898 --> 00:26:09.898
New plan.

323
00:26:10.358 --> 00:26:14.236
Kill the boy, kick their asses,
and then go get some lunch.

324
00:26:14.445 --> 00:26:16.029
I could do with some exercise.

325
00:26:23.288 --> 00:26:24.288
Seal it off, boys!

326
00:26:24.998 --> 00:26:26.039
You were saying?

327
00:26:26.791 --> 00:26:30.627
On the other hand,
discretion is the better part of valor.

328
00:26:30.795 --> 00:26:32.004
You're the Musketeers.

329
00:26:32.213 --> 00:26:33.297
Wrong.

330
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:37.092
We were the Musketeers.
Now we're just...us.

331
00:26:51.357 --> 00:26:52.691
Rochefort.

332
00:27:40.657 --> 00:27:41.698
Shall we?

333
00:27:59.425 --> 00:28:01.051
Finish them off.

334
00:28:04.722 --> 00:28:05.847
Let's even the odds.

335
00:29:10.663 --> 00:29:11.747
Enjoying the show?

336
00:29:12.248 --> 00:29:13.373
- You!
- Watch out!

337
00:29:31.017 --> 00:29:32.684
You didn't
answer my question.

338
00:29:32.852 --> 00:29:34.019
Are you always this cocky?

339
00:29:34.812 --> 00:29:35.812
Only on Tuesdays

340
00:29:40.193 --> 00:29:41.693
and whenever beautiful women are involved.

341
00:29:43.196 --> 00:29:44.196
Damn you!

342
00:29:48.075 --> 00:29:49.951
Can't you see
we're trying to have a conversation?

343
00:30:06.219 --> 00:30:07.886
What is your name?

344
00:30:09.263 --> 00:30:10.555
Constance.

345
00:30:11.349 --> 00:30:14.267
Constance. Sounds very steadfast.

346
00:30:14.894 --> 00:30:16.603
A quality you seem to know little about.

347
00:30:16.771 --> 00:30:18.355
Oh, I beg to differ.

348
00:30:18.523 --> 00:30:21.233
Deep down, I am a hopeless romantic.

349
00:30:21.776 --> 00:30:23.235
Back for more?

350
00:30:34.288 --> 00:30:37.791
Musketeers! Musketeers! Musketeers!

351
00:30:40.962 --> 00:30:43.088
I'd forgotten what it feels like.

352
00:30:43.589 --> 00:30:45.048
We all have.

353
00:30:48.094 --> 00:30:49.803
The name is D'Artagnan.

354
00:30:51.222 --> 00:30:52.973
You must come from a very small town.

355
00:30:53.224 --> 00:30:54.266
How did you know?

356
00:30:54.433 --> 00:30:56.726
Lines like yours
might actually work there.

357
00:30:56.936 --> 00:30:59.771
This is Paris.
I suggest you stick to swordplay.

358
00:31:00.481 --> 00:31:04.568
In the battle of wits,
you, sir, are unarmed.

359
00:31:10.575 --> 00:31:11.741
She's right, lad.

360
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:15.161
The ladies of Paris
are infinitely more complicated.

361
00:31:15.329 --> 00:31:18.498
They have 1,000 ways of saying, "No,"
and only some of them mean, "Yes."

362
00:31:18.624 --> 00:31:20.417
I hate to ruin the mood,
but they will be back.

363
00:31:20.459 --> 00:31:23.420
And unless you wish to
fight an entire army.

364
00:31:25.923 --> 00:31:27.299
Elsewhere.

365
00:31:31.637 --> 00:31:34.764
So, now what?
Do we pick up where we left off?

366
00:31:34.932 --> 00:31:36.892
I think there's been enough fighting
for one day.

367
00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:40.478
Besides, any man who's an enemy
of Rochefort is a friend of mine.

368
00:31:40.605 --> 00:31:41.646
Who's Rochefort?

369
00:31:41.731 --> 00:31:43.982
Captain of the Cardinal's guards.

370
00:31:44.066 --> 00:31:46.443
The right hand of the most powerful man
in France.

371
00:31:46.485 --> 00:31:48.862
Rochefort is the most feared swordsman
in Europe.

372
00:31:49.322 --> 00:31:51.823
You certainly know how to pick your fights.

373
00:31:51.991 --> 00:31:54.910
Like I said, he insulted my horse.

374
00:31:56.829 --> 00:32:00.665
You're reckless,
arrogant, impetuous,

375
00:32:00.833 --> 00:32:03.835
probably be dead by sundown,
but I like you, lad.

376
00:32:05.838 --> 00:32:08.089
- Where are you staying?
- No idea.

377
00:32:08.257 --> 00:32:10.091
Ah! Do you have any money?

378
00:32:13.512 --> 00:32:14.679
Well, good sir,

379
00:32:14.847 --> 00:32:19.184
you and your fine steed
are welcome in our humble home.

380
00:32:20.478 --> 00:32:21.811
For the time being.

381
00:32:22.647 --> 00:32:25.273
That goes in there.

382
00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.194
Come on.

383
00:32:30.696 --> 00:32:32.322
What shall we drink to?

384
00:32:33.699 --> 00:32:34.783
How about the King?

385
00:32:34.867 --> 00:32:39.663
He's a child. Cardinal rules in all
but name, might as well drink to him.

386
00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:42.707
To France.

387
00:32:42.875 --> 00:32:46.544
We served it, fought for it and bled for it.
Look where it got us.

388
00:32:46.671 --> 00:32:48.296
Friendship? Love?

389
00:32:48.923 --> 00:32:52.550
Word of advice, boy.
Trust no one.

390
00:32:54.553 --> 00:32:57.055
Must be something you still believe in.

391
00:32:57.765 --> 00:33:01.059
This.

392
00:33:02.228 --> 00:33:03.561
And this.

393
00:33:06.524 --> 00:33:09.609
Anyone who tells you otherwise is either
a fool or trying to sell you something.

394
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:21.746
I know Athos may seem cold and unfriendly,
but don't let it fool you.

395
00:33:22.248 --> 00:33:25.583
- Deep down...
- He really is cold and unfriendly.

396
00:33:26.377 --> 00:33:27.711
What happened to him?

397
00:33:28.045 --> 00:33:31.089
What happens to any man, a woman.

398
00:33:32.633 --> 00:33:35.051
You know, I don't want to offend anybody,

399
00:33:36.804 --> 00:33:40.432
but I thought you'd all be
a little bit more...heroic.

400
00:33:44.437 --> 00:33:47.105
What my esteemed colleague
was trying to say, in his own way,

401
00:33:47.189 --> 00:33:49.566
is that we are obsolete.

402
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.820
We're warriors,
but there's no war for us to fight.

403
00:33:54.488 --> 00:33:58.283
And so we drink and brawl
and quarrel with the Cardinal's guards

404
00:33:58.367 --> 00:34:00.201
and then we drink some more.

405
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.122
What we need is a great cause.

406
00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:07.625
But there are no great causes left.

407
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.587
Which is why I keep telling you it's not
too late to do that priest thing again.

408
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:11.838
Beats working for the city.

409
00:34:12.173 --> 00:34:15.133
Free booze at wakes and weddings.
And then there's the nuns.

410
00:34:15.676 --> 00:34:16.843
You were a priest?

411
00:34:17.011 --> 00:34:19.054
Until I realized being a man of God

412
00:34:19.138 --> 00:34:21.473
and a man of the cloth
aren't always the same thing.

413
00:34:21.974 --> 00:34:24.893
And yet, he still says prayers
for those he kills.

414
00:34:24.977 --> 00:34:27.020
- Old habit.
- On the contrary.

415
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.647
The men I kill deserve to die.

416
00:34:30.066 --> 00:34:32.150
But they also deserve peace.

417
00:34:32.193 --> 00:34:34.527
After all, they must have believed
in something.

418
00:34:35.029 --> 00:34:37.822
We all do. Even the worst of us.

419
00:34:38.532 --> 00:34:40.033
I'll drink to that!

420
00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.411
Planchet! More wine!

421
00:34:45.331 --> 00:34:46.664
Planchet!

422
00:34:47.166 --> 00:34:48.875
Sorry, sirs.

423
00:34:50.169 --> 00:34:51.169
I'm afraid

424
00:34:52.338 --> 00:34:54.255
there's none left. You've drunk the lot.

425
00:34:54.423 --> 00:34:55.673
What sort of answer's that?

426
00:34:56.383 --> 00:34:58.134
Well, go get some more, man!

427
00:34:58.302 --> 00:35:00.512
Very good, sir. It's just, I can't, sir.

428
00:35:02.473 --> 00:35:03.848
We've run out of money.

429
00:35:06.644 --> 00:35:08.353
Planchet, what are you?

430
00:35:08.729 --> 00:35:11.064
- Complete and utter waste of space, sir?
- And?

431
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.358
- As much use as a fart in a bottle, sir?
- Right.

432
00:35:13.567 --> 00:35:16.736
In short, sir, a total tit, sir.
But I can't work bleeding miracles!

433
00:35:17.655 --> 00:35:18.863
Planchet?

434
00:35:20.741 --> 00:35:21.866
Oh!

435
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.954
Thank you very much, sir!

436
00:35:26.163 --> 00:35:30.041
That's incredibly generous
from such a handsome, young man.

437
00:35:30.084 --> 00:35:32.210
Thank you very, very much.

438
00:35:32.336 --> 00:35:34.420
Will you be staying here tonight?

439
00:35:34.588 --> 00:35:35.839
He'll be taking your bed, Planchet.

440
00:35:38.634 --> 00:35:40.343
Right, and so I'll be sleeping...

441
00:35:40.386 --> 00:35:41.886
You may take the balcony.

442
00:35:42.388 --> 00:35:44.347
Outside? The balcony outside in the cold?

443
00:35:44.515 --> 00:35:47.392
With birds shitting on my head all night?

444
00:35:47.768 --> 00:35:49.269
Great, can I just say you...

445
00:35:49.436 --> 00:35:50.728
Wine! Wine!

446
00:35:50.896 --> 00:35:54.065
- Wine! Wine! Wine! Wine!
- Yes! Of course! Wine it is, sirs!

447
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:17.630
Check.

448
00:36:17.882 --> 00:36:20.300
This is a ridiculous game.

449
00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.011
Surely the King
should be the most powerful piece?

450
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.847
The King is the most important piece.

451
00:36:25.931 --> 00:36:28.349
But he's vulnerable, he needs protection.

452
00:36:28.601 --> 00:36:30.643
May I suggest you castle him?

453
00:36:38.444 --> 00:36:39.944
Checkmate.

454
00:36:44.867 --> 00:36:47.160
There. What do you think of that?

455
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.788
Your Majesty is a force of nature.

456
00:36:51.457 --> 00:36:54.709
- Took you by surprise, eh?
- Yes, indeed, you did.

457
00:36:57.129 --> 00:36:59.297
May we speak a little about foreign policy?

458
00:36:59.715 --> 00:37:02.926
- It's not about Buckingham, is it?
- Oh, I'm afraid it is.

459
00:37:03.677 --> 00:37:05.887
He's arriving in Paris tomorrow.

460
00:37:06.055 --> 00:37:10.266
His master, King James, has agreed
to hear our peace proposal.

461
00:37:10.851 --> 00:37:14.938
Good, good. Well, he knows better
than to mess with me, then.

462
00:37:15.397 --> 00:37:16.397
There's also another matter.

463
00:37:17.274 --> 00:37:19.525
A dangerous rivalry has sprung

464
00:37:19.652 --> 00:37:22.195
between Your Majesty's Musketeers
and my personal guards.

465
00:37:22.655 --> 00:37:23.863
Who was involved?

466
00:37:24.323 --> 00:37:27.200
Athos, Porthos, Aramis.

467
00:37:27.785 --> 00:37:29.827
The usual suspects.

468
00:37:29.995 --> 00:37:32.413
And a young man called D'Artagnan.

469
00:37:33.165 --> 00:37:38.002
I have summoned them to the palace so that
Your Majesty can punish them severely.

470
00:37:58.232 --> 00:38:00.066
His Majesty, the King!

471
00:38:00.776 --> 00:38:02.360
Well, well, well.

472
00:38:05.406 --> 00:38:07.407
Brawling with the Cardinal's guards.

473
00:38:07.908 --> 00:38:09.409
That's very bad.

474
00:38:09.868 --> 00:38:11.536
What have you got to say for yourselves?

475
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:15.164
- We...
- Humbly beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

476
00:38:15.332 --> 00:38:17.709
Yes.
Yes, I should hope so, too.

477
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:21.087
So, tell me, how many
were involved in the altercation?

478
00:38:21.672 --> 00:38:24.882
There were four of us against 40 of them,
Your Majesty.

479
00:38:25.509 --> 00:38:26.551
Four against 40?

480
00:38:29.638 --> 00:38:31.556
And you beat them like a drum?

481
00:38:31.807 --> 00:38:34.767
And, yes, you shall have to be reprimanded,
of course,

482
00:38:34.852 --> 00:38:36.602
most harshly, I'm afraid.

483
00:38:36.979 --> 00:38:39.230
- You do understand that, don't you?
- We do, Your Majesty.

484
00:38:39.315 --> 00:38:40.398
Her Majesty, the Queen.

485
00:38:48.282 --> 00:38:49.365
Anne.

486
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.826
What a... What a pleasant surprise!

487
00:38:52.745 --> 00:38:55.246
My ladies and I wanted to see
the valiant Musketeers

488
00:38:55.331 --> 00:38:57.040
who stood against the Cardinal's guards.

489
00:38:57.708 --> 00:38:59.751
Four against 40?

490
00:38:59.793 --> 00:39:01.002
Or was it 400?

491
00:39:02.421 --> 00:39:04.005
Just 40, Your Majesty.

492
00:39:04.256 --> 00:39:05.631
Lt was an off day.

493
00:39:06.842 --> 00:39:08.343
That's my Musketeers for you.

494
00:39:08.427 --> 00:39:11.179
By the time they write songs about them,
it'll be 4,000.

495
00:39:11.263 --> 00:39:12.764
I hope you won't be too harsh with them.

496
00:39:14.016 --> 00:39:16.059
After all, boys will be boys.

497
00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.107
You must be D'Artagnan.

498
00:39:24.234 --> 00:39:28.446
My lady in waiting has told me about
how brave and dashing you were yesterday.

499
00:39:29.114 --> 00:39:31.324
But you must try not to be so reckless.

500
00:39:31.408 --> 00:39:32.784
Can't help myself, Your Majesty.

501
00:39:33.535 --> 00:39:35.286
- Your Majesty, the culprits.
- Ah! Yes, yes.

502
00:39:37.831 --> 00:39:38.915
Well, stand up, then.

503
00:39:46.215 --> 00:39:47.215
Athos.

504
00:39:48.092 --> 00:39:49.300
Porthos.

505
00:39:49.968 --> 00:39:51.302
Aramis.

506
00:39:53.889 --> 00:39:58.810
Forgive me for saying this, D'Artagnan,
but you do look a little underdressed.

507
00:40:00.062 --> 00:40:02.397
My father is a poor man, Your Majesty.

508
00:40:02.981 --> 00:40:05.191
A former Musketeer as well.

509
00:40:05.651 --> 00:40:08.027
These are the only clothes I have.

510
00:40:09.029 --> 00:40:11.155
Oh, Lord.
We shall have to rectify that.

511
00:40:11.573 --> 00:40:15.660
Can't have my Musketeers,
or the son of one, looking like tramps.

512
00:40:16.912 --> 00:40:19.455
New suits all around, I think.

513
00:40:20.207 --> 00:40:22.917
Yes. You'll see to that, Cardinal?

514
00:40:23.168 --> 00:40:27.630
And, yes, I think a purse of gold for each
as a reward for your courage.

515
00:40:27.714 --> 00:40:29.257
You'll see to that as well, Cardinal.

516
00:40:29.425 --> 00:40:31.259
And, yes, before I forget,

517
00:40:31.343 --> 00:40:34.137
no more fighting
with His Eminence's guards.

518
00:40:34.513 --> 00:40:35.596
Hmm?

519
00:40:38.642 --> 00:40:40.351
Or there'll be none of them left.

520
00:40:42.896 --> 00:40:44.856
Your Majesty, might I suggest a more...

521
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.858
Forgive my impudence, Cardinal,

522
00:40:47.025 --> 00:40:49.402
but I doubt the King
requires your advice in this matter.

523
00:40:49.486 --> 00:40:51.654
After all, they are his Musketeers.

524
00:40:52.197 --> 00:40:53.197
Good day, gentlemen.

525
00:40:59.705 --> 00:41:01.581
Well, now,
off with you rascals.

526
00:41:02.207 --> 00:41:07.003
But be there for the parade tomorrow.
New suits and all.

527
00:41:08.922 --> 00:41:10.923
I tire of these royal children.

528
00:41:11.884 --> 00:41:14.218
Lt's time to make our move.

529
00:41:14.845 --> 00:41:18.181
We shall use Buckingham's arrival
to our advantage.

530
00:41:18.348 --> 00:41:20.266
During his visit, we will reveal

531
00:41:20.434 --> 00:41:23.811
that he arranged a secret rendezvous
with the Queen.

532
00:41:23.979 --> 00:41:27.398
May I inquire how Your Eminence
has uncovered this scandalous affair?

533
00:41:27.483 --> 00:41:32.111
By reading Buckingham's letters
to the Queen, found in her possession.

534
00:41:32.279 --> 00:41:35.198
Written in Buckingham's hand,
then authenticated by his seal?

535
00:41:35.741 --> 00:41:39.076
A woman of your talents
should have no trouble procuring either.

536
00:41:39.495 --> 00:41:41.746
Hmm. Your Eminence is too kind.

537
00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:44.081
However, I doubt that the King
will accept such letters

538
00:41:44.166 --> 00:41:47.627
as definitive proof of
his wife's indiscretion.

539
00:41:48.629 --> 00:41:52.048
Then we shall provide him
with something a bit more substantial.

540
00:41:52.216 --> 00:41:56.886
A piece of the Queen's jewelry given
to Buckingham as a token of affection.

541
00:41:56.929 --> 00:41:59.096
Buckingham will be humiliated.

542
00:41:59.348 --> 00:42:00.640
The King will be outraged.

543
00:42:00.766 --> 00:42:03.267
The Queen will be executed.

544
00:42:03.685 --> 00:42:06.687
France will have no
choice but to go to war.

545
00:42:07.523 --> 00:42:12.068
And in times like these, France will
naturally turn to a stronger leader.

546
00:42:13.278 --> 00:42:18.324
Someone better equipped to rule a nation
than a cuckolded teenager with a grudge.

547
00:42:19.117 --> 00:42:20.159
Hmm.

548
00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:24.914
Someone like Your Eminence.

549
00:42:36.468 --> 00:42:39.136
About face!

550
00:42:56.029 --> 00:42:59.657
Well, where is he, then?
Lt's just appalling manners.

551
00:43:22.598 --> 00:43:24.640
Drop anchor!

552
00:43:25.017 --> 00:43:26.100
Anchor aweigh!

553
00:43:40.866 --> 00:43:42.366
Damn his impudence!

554
00:43:43.493 --> 00:43:46.203
What is that thing called
anyway, Richelieu?

555
00:43:46.705 --> 00:43:48.873
An airship, Your Majesty.

556
00:43:55.756 --> 00:43:58.799
- Why don't I have one of those?
- An oversight on our part.

557
00:43:58.884 --> 00:44:02.136
Right, right. Well, build me one.

558
00:44:16.693 --> 00:44:18.069
Secure the lines!

559
00:44:18.528 --> 00:44:19.987
All lines secured!

560
00:44:37.714 --> 00:44:38.964
Buckingham.

561
00:44:41.426 --> 00:44:42.510
Blue.

562
00:44:43.929 --> 00:44:45.012
Oh.

563
00:44:50.018 --> 00:44:51.644
Your Majesty.

564
00:44:53.063 --> 00:44:54.271
Love the outfit.

565
00:44:54.606 --> 00:44:56.023
Very retro.

566
00:44:56.191 --> 00:44:57.525
We were all wearing those in London,

567
00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:01.862
when was it, last year or the year before?

568
00:45:03.281 --> 00:45:07.034
Lord Buckingham, I trust your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

569
00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:08.953
Not at all. No.

570
00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:10.287
On the contrary.

571
00:45:10.455 --> 00:45:14.333
Handles like a dream and keeps me
one step closer to heaven.

572
00:45:15.127 --> 00:45:16.627
Cardinal.

573
00:45:21.299 --> 00:45:25.970
Of course, being a servant of God,
you have no need for such crude devices.

574
00:45:27.305 --> 00:45:30.307
King James is most eager
to hear your peace proposal.

575
00:45:30.392 --> 00:45:32.143
- Lord Buckingham.
- Anne.

576
00:45:32.728 --> 00:45:33.728
Your Majesty.

577
00:45:34.396 --> 00:45:38.315
I must say your beauty is far more radiant
than I remember.

578
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.942
You've met before?

579
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.527
A long time ago.

580
00:45:41.611 --> 00:45:44.572
An evening I shall cherish forever.

581
00:45:46.408 --> 00:45:48.159
Right. Well, shall we?

582
00:45:52.998 --> 00:45:54.915
Now this is a pleasant surprise.

583
00:45:56.001 --> 00:45:57.793
Another acquaintance of yours, I see.

584
00:45:58.211 --> 00:45:59.670
We've met, yes.

585
00:45:59.838 --> 00:46:03.758
As I recall, last I saw you,
you were on your knees as well.

586
00:46:04.384 --> 00:46:06.552
Most unfortunate habit.

587
00:46:06.762 --> 00:46:09.346
Lt's a habit I shall have to break
during our next encounter.

588
00:46:10.974 --> 00:46:12.850
I look forward to it.

589
00:46:13.643 --> 00:46:16.020
In the meantime, shall we talk peace?

590
00:46:21.735 --> 00:46:24.904
You must pass me the name
of your interior decorator.

591
00:46:25.572 --> 00:46:26.572
Wine?

592
00:46:27.032 --> 00:46:28.199
I don't drink.

593
00:46:28.784 --> 00:46:31.994
What about that rather nice bottle of
Bordeaux in your middle left-hand drawer?

594
00:46:33.079 --> 00:46:35.831
You must pass me the name
of your spy in the palace.

595
00:46:36.666 --> 00:46:38.334
And yours in mine.

596
00:46:41.046 --> 00:46:43.672
England cannot afford a war on two fronts.

597
00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.383
Both our nations
are stretched to breaking point.

598
00:46:46.468 --> 00:46:50.554
A peace treaty would be
of immense strategic advantage.

599
00:46:50.722 --> 00:46:53.015
Whose advantage? Yours?

600
00:46:53.099 --> 00:46:54.099
Ours.

601
00:46:55.185 --> 00:47:00.231
I have a feeling my new war machines
will readdress the balance.

602
00:47:02.776 --> 00:47:04.401
Very impressive.

603
00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:10.491
And march!
Left, left, left, right, left!

604
00:47:14.037 --> 00:47:15.621
Hold your line!

605
00:47:15.872 --> 00:47:16.872
Halt!

606
00:47:16.957 --> 00:47:18.749
About face!

607
00:47:20.961 --> 00:47:22.086
Stay where you are!

608
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:24.255
This is the Queen's wing.
You can't be up here.

609
00:47:24.422 --> 00:47:25.673
Oh, thank goodness.

610
00:47:25.841 --> 00:47:30.135
I got so lost. I took a wrong turn
and then a door slammed behind me.

611
00:47:30.387 --> 00:47:34.682
I've been trapped up here, in the sun,
in this heat.

612
00:47:34.933 --> 00:47:37.017
- It's going to be all right.
- Oh, I'm gonna faint.

613
00:47:37.102 --> 00:47:39.395
- You're in safe hands.
- Thank you.

614
00:47:39.646 --> 00:47:40.938
And march!

615
00:48:03.003 --> 00:48:04.003
Halt!

616
00:48:04.629 --> 00:48:07.214
You can't shoot. They'll hear you.

617
00:48:07.465 --> 00:48:08.591
Shh!

618
00:48:09.342 --> 00:48:10.634
Wait for it!

619
00:48:20.312 --> 00:48:21.979
Left, left!

620
00:48:23.982 --> 00:48:27.067
Constance! Constance!
Hey, hey, excuse me!

621
00:48:27.819 --> 00:48:29.737
Pardon, Your Majesty.

622
00:48:29.905 --> 00:48:31.739
This will only take a moment.

623
00:48:33.992 --> 00:48:35.659
What are you doing here?

624
00:48:35.827 --> 00:48:38.704
His Majesty wants a word with me.
Imagine that.

625
00:48:38.872 --> 00:48:41.206
Yes, lovely. Now, excuse me.

626
00:48:41.374 --> 00:48:42.458
I was...

627
00:48:42.626 --> 00:48:47.046
I was thinking, after I'm finished
with His Majesty, maybe we could talk?

628
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.881
I can't. I have plans.

629
00:48:48.965 --> 00:48:49.965
What about tomorrow?

630
00:48:50.091 --> 00:48:51.091
I have a lot of plans.

631
00:48:51.217 --> 00:48:52.801
- Well, I...
- Look, D'Artagnan.

632
00:48:52.844 --> 00:48:55.846
You may have a new set of clothes
and the King's favor,

633
00:48:56.014 --> 00:48:58.223
but you still act like
a clumsy country boy.

634
00:48:58.433 --> 00:48:59.975
Now excuse me.

635
00:49:17.035 --> 00:49:18.369
And halt!

636
00:49:19.496 --> 00:49:21.163
About face!

637
00:49:22.248 --> 00:49:23.916
And march!

638
00:49:25.126 --> 00:49:27.419
Left! Left, right, left!

639
00:49:31.257 --> 00:49:34.885
Two summons in two days.
Your Majesty honors me.

640
00:49:34.928 --> 00:49:37.930
Cut it out.
Please, think nothing of it.

641
00:49:38.348 --> 00:49:40.891
You're a good fellow, D'Artagnan.

642
00:49:40.976 --> 00:49:44.728
So, how are the ladies
treating you these days?

643
00:49:45.605 --> 00:49:47.690
- Can't complain.
- Yes, indeed.

644
00:49:47.857 --> 00:49:50.025
Well, same here, of course. Thing is...

645
00:49:52.946 --> 00:49:55.656
I've got this friend.

646
00:49:56.616 --> 00:49:58.450
Just a regular chap, like you and me.

647
00:49:58.827 --> 00:50:00.536
He got married very young.

648
00:50:01.037 --> 00:50:04.081
Political alliance, arranged marriage,
you know the sort of thing.

649
00:50:04.249 --> 00:50:05.374
Hardly knew the girl.

650
00:50:05.542 --> 00:50:08.460
- But he likes her?
- Oh, yes.

651
00:50:08.628 --> 00:50:09.670
Mmm-hmm.

652
00:50:09.754 --> 00:50:10.754
Very much.

653
00:50:11.172 --> 00:50:12.881
Well, does she like him?

654
00:50:13.049 --> 00:50:16.719
Well, funny you should say that.
That's the problem.

655
00:50:16.928 --> 00:50:18.971
He's... He's not sure.

656
00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:23.308
Well, he just feels like a fool
when he's around her.

657
00:50:23.643 --> 00:50:26.937
He's always saying the wrong thing.
His palms are sweating.

658
00:50:27.564 --> 00:50:30.899
His heart's pumping so loud
he's afraid she might hear it.

659
00:50:31.151 --> 00:50:32.693
Lt's torture just to look at her.

660
00:50:33.653 --> 00:50:36.530
- Have you ever felt this way?
- Not until recently.

661
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:42.494
So, what do we do?
I mean, my friend. What does he do?

662
00:50:44.372 --> 00:50:46.832
He should speak his heart.

663
00:50:47.584 --> 00:50:50.878
Be someone who cares for her
and isn't afraid to show it.

664
00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:55.007
Be himself.

665
00:50:55.425 --> 00:50:57.176
Well, that's what I told him.

666
00:50:57.302 --> 00:50:59.094
Well, then he's doubly lucky.

667
00:50:59.471 --> 00:51:01.972
After all, he does have
Your Majesty as a friend.

668
00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:05.893
Yes. Yes. lt's good to have friends.

669
00:51:09.355 --> 00:51:11.315
Will you excuse me just for one moment?

670
00:51:12.233 --> 00:51:13.650
I don't believe it.

671
00:51:20.825 --> 00:51:21.867
How are you?

672
00:51:22.535 --> 00:51:23.786
Very well.

673
00:51:26.372 --> 00:51:27.831
I'm wearing blue.

674
00:51:28.666 --> 00:51:30.000
And you look very handsome in it.

675
00:51:31.503 --> 00:51:36.090
Thank you. Yes, I...
You're looking just very lovely.

676
00:51:36.174 --> 00:51:40.094
In fact, I was only just remarking
to D'Artagnan how...

677
00:51:42.097 --> 00:51:43.555
How beautiful you are.

678
00:51:45.475 --> 00:51:46.558
Thank you, My Lord.

679
00:53:20.486 --> 00:53:22.738
- How did it go?
- Clockwork.

680
00:53:23.198 --> 00:53:24.281
Good.

681
00:53:25.033 --> 00:53:28.535
You'll go back to London
with Buckingham and the diamonds.

682
00:53:28.703 --> 00:53:30.329
And what should I do with them?

683
00:53:30.496 --> 00:53:34.249
Put them in his personal vault,
the most secure location in all of England.

684
00:53:34.417 --> 00:53:36.293
- The Tower of London.
- Yup.

685
00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:40.464
When the scandal breaks,
he'll deny everything.

686
00:53:40.798 --> 00:53:43.133
But once the diamonds
are discovered in his possession...

687
00:53:43.384 --> 00:53:46.011
He would have led England to war
through his indiscretion.

688
00:53:47.764 --> 00:53:50.891
And what of the future of France?

689
00:53:53.269 --> 00:53:54.645
I am France.

690
00:54:04.322 --> 00:54:05.989
One last thing.

691
00:54:08.993 --> 00:54:12.162
I suppose it's quite easy,
perhaps even tempting,

692
00:54:12.205 --> 00:54:15.332
for a double agent to play both sides.

693
00:54:16.542 --> 00:54:19.795
Have I given Your Eminence
any reason to doubt my loyalty?

694
00:54:19.837 --> 00:54:21.463
Spare me the rhetoric.

695
00:54:22.757 --> 00:54:25.550
I know who you are. I know what you are.

696
00:54:27.011 --> 00:54:30.597
You have a gift for corruption
and a penchant for betrayal.

697
00:54:30.682 --> 00:54:32.516
I admire such skills.

698
00:54:33.393 --> 00:54:35.936
But I'll destroy you the moment I suspect

699
00:54:36.187 --> 00:54:38.438
you might be using them against me.

700
00:54:40.316 --> 00:54:42.317
Do we understand one another?

701
00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:45.696
There

702
00:54:46.864 --> 00:54:49.074
is another side to that coin.

703
00:54:49.867 --> 00:54:53.912
Lt's quite easy for an employer
to sever all ties with his operative,

704
00:54:54.622 --> 00:54:57.874
in the event that they are compromised,
leaving them to

705
00:54:57.917 --> 00:55:00.961
rot in jail or on the gallows.

706
00:55:03.256 --> 00:55:04.965
Your point being?

707
00:55:06.634 --> 00:55:10.178
I require a guarantee
that I shall not suffer a similar fate.

708
00:55:12.056 --> 00:55:14.558
An insurance policy, if you will.

709
00:55:15.643 --> 00:55:17.644
My word should suffice.

710
00:55:18.813 --> 00:55:21.690
I'm afraid I'll need something a bit more

711
00:55:23.192 --> 00:55:24.568
substantial.

712
00:55:27.405 --> 00:55:30.991
"It is by my order
and for the good of the State

713
00:55:31.075 --> 00:55:35.162
"that the bearer of this
has done what has been done."

714
00:55:35.747 --> 00:55:37.122
Satisfied?

715
00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.623
Immensely.

716
00:55:45.048 --> 00:55:46.381
Your Majesty.

717
00:55:46.841 --> 00:55:47.841
Purple?

718
00:55:50.094 --> 00:55:52.304
Fashion favors the bold.

719
00:55:53.681 --> 00:55:54.681
Here.

720
00:55:54.974 --> 00:55:56.600
Try this for size.

721
00:55:58.144 --> 00:55:59.144
Oh, well.

722
00:55:59.354 --> 00:56:00.937
Do give my regards to the Queen.

723
00:56:01.397 --> 00:56:05.317
I will convey your diplomatic proposal
to King James immediately.

724
00:56:05.485 --> 00:56:08.320
Cardinal Richelieu, a pleasure.

725
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:10.280
All mine.

726
00:56:16.412 --> 00:56:17.829
Your Eminence.

727
00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.600
Richelieu!

728
00:56:38.643 --> 00:56:39.768
Richelieu!

729
00:56:40.603 --> 00:56:42.687
There has been
the most distressing development.

730
00:56:42.814 --> 00:56:44.147
Certain letters,

731
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:47.234
love letters, were discovered
in the Queen's possession.

732
00:56:47.318 --> 00:56:48.568
Letters from him.

733
00:56:48.986 --> 00:56:51.238
Buckingham, of course! Who else?

734
00:56:51.322 --> 00:56:53.407
Have you spoken to the Queen
about these letters?

735
00:56:53.616 --> 00:56:56.827
No. Of course I haven't.
She'll just deny the whole thing!

736
00:56:57.161 --> 00:56:58.203
Hmm.

737
00:56:58.287 --> 00:57:00.997
I can see Your Majesty's dilemma.

738
00:57:01.916 --> 00:57:05.252
Is there any mention
of a specific encounter? A detail?

739
00:57:06.337 --> 00:57:08.755
- A token of affection, perhaps?
- Yes.

740
00:57:08.923 --> 00:57:10.298
Yes, there is.

741
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.553
A necklace. The one I gave her
for our anniversary. Here.

742
00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.432
"I shall always cherish
the 1 2 studded diamonds you gave me,

743
00:57:19.016 --> 00:57:21.268
"the proof of our consummated love."

744
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:25.355
Does "consummated" mean
what I think it means?

745
00:57:25.565 --> 00:57:27.274
Yes, I'm afraid it does.

746
00:57:29.193 --> 00:57:30.569
Oh, my God!

747
00:57:31.571 --> 00:57:34.239
All Your Majesty has to do is throw a ball.

748
00:57:35.158 --> 00:57:36.867
What? How would that help?

749
00:57:37.034 --> 00:57:40.454
Lt would give Your Majesty the pretext
to suggest to the Queen

750
00:57:40.538 --> 00:57:41.746
that she wear your gift.

751
00:57:43.458 --> 00:57:46.877
Oh, Richelieu, that's very clever.
That's very clever.

752
00:57:47.837 --> 00:57:49.504
So, if she has the diamonds...

753
00:57:49.755 --> 00:57:51.381
Your Majesty can rest easy.

754
00:57:53.217 --> 00:57:54.634
And if she doesn't?

755
00:57:56.053 --> 00:57:59.055
He wants to have a celebration ball,
five days from now.

756
00:57:59.474 --> 00:58:01.892
Send my diamonds to the jeweler's
to be polished.

757
00:58:02.226 --> 00:58:04.936
I want the King's undivided attention
that evening.

758
00:58:25.208 --> 00:58:26.416
I hope I am not interrupting.

759
00:58:26.626 --> 00:58:29.336
Hardly, Your Majesty. To what do I owe...

760
00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:30.420
I know.

761
00:58:31.547 --> 00:58:34.299
Perhaps Your Majesty
would care to be a bit more specific?

762
00:58:34.926 --> 00:58:36.134
I know.

763
00:58:36.802 --> 00:58:37.844
Yeah.

764
00:58:37.929 --> 00:58:40.805
I assume this is the part
where I'm supposed to laugh maniacally

765
00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:44.893
and regale Your Majesty with the details
of some diabolical plot.

766
00:58:45.478 --> 00:58:48.104
However, I regret to inform Your Majesty

767
00:58:48.272 --> 00:58:50.815
that I have no idea of
what you're talking about.

768
00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.526
I thought you'd say that.

769
00:58:52.777 --> 00:58:56.154
Then why did you grace me
with the honor of your visit?

770
00:58:56.614 --> 00:58:58.281
To look into your eyes when you said it.

771
00:59:07.833 --> 00:59:09.251
Your Majesty.

772
00:59:12.797 --> 00:59:14.631
All may not be lost yet.

773
00:59:20.304 --> 00:59:22.013
Coming, coming!
Hold your horses!

774
00:59:22.557 --> 00:59:24.558
Lt's not a matter of
life or death, you know?

775
00:59:24.642 --> 00:59:26.476
Actually, it is.

776
00:59:26.811 --> 00:59:28.478
You want me to go to England,

777
00:59:28.563 --> 00:59:30.313
retrieve the diamonds,
which the Queen suspects

778
00:59:30.356 --> 00:59:32.315
might be in Buckingham's possession,

779
00:59:32.608 --> 00:59:34.734
which will naturally involve breaking into
some heavily fortified,

780
00:59:34.986 --> 00:59:37.070
highly impregnable facility?

781
00:59:37.154 --> 00:59:38.280
The Tower of London.

782
00:59:38.364 --> 00:59:41.241
Since the Cardinal's spies
are trying to implicate the Duke,

783
00:59:41.325 --> 00:59:42.617
it is the most logical choice.

784
00:59:43.452 --> 00:59:47.163
Then return to Paris
with every soldier, assassin,

785
00:59:47.498 --> 00:59:50.208
mercenary, bounty hunter,

786
00:59:50.585 --> 00:59:54.045
on both sides of the Channel
out to stop me from doing so.

787
00:59:54.422 --> 00:59:55.839
Did I miss anything?

788
00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:57.507
All in five days.

789
00:59:57.675 --> 00:59:59.801
A minor detail. Anything else?

790
01:00:00.011 --> 01:00:01.011
No.

791
01:00:02.346 --> 01:00:04.097
Well, I really only have
one question for you.

792
01:00:05.141 --> 01:00:07.142
Why in the world would I do that?

793
01:00:15.526 --> 01:00:16.943
England it is.

794
01:00:20.197 --> 01:00:22.198
Diamonds, Buckingham,
Tower of London, five days,

795
01:00:22.241 --> 01:00:24.659
Queen's reputation
and the fate of France as we know it.

796
01:00:25.536 --> 01:00:26.745
Who's with me?

797
01:00:31.626 --> 01:00:34.628
Well, I should imagine
the Queen would be quite generous.

798
01:00:35.004 --> 01:00:39.716
Count Porthos. Hmm? What do you think?
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

799
01:00:40.051 --> 01:00:44.346
Besides, I hear the English women are a
lot like a frosted bottle of champagne.

800
01:00:44.472 --> 01:00:47.182
Ice on the outside,
but once you warm them up...

801
01:00:47.933 --> 01:00:51.978
This isn't a great cause,
but it'll have to do.

802
01:00:57.401 --> 01:00:59.444
Buckingham's there, so is she.

803
01:00:59.904 --> 01:01:00.904
Who?

804
01:01:01.572 --> 01:01:02.906
Countess de Winter.

805
01:01:03.407 --> 01:01:04.532
Charlotte Backson.

806
01:01:04.784 --> 01:01:07.160
Anne de Breuil. Lady Clarick.

807
01:01:08.204 --> 01:01:09.412
Milady.

808
01:01:09.997 --> 01:01:11.081
Milady?

809
01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:14.626
I know her. I saw her with Rochefort.

810
01:01:15.127 --> 01:01:16.544
She's switched sides again.

811
01:01:16.712 --> 01:01:18.588
She's working for the Cardinal, no doubt.

812
01:01:18.673 --> 01:01:20.131
What are you going to do if you catch her?

813
01:01:22.051 --> 01:01:25.428
Musketeers, open up
and surrender by order of the Cardinal!

814
01:01:25.721 --> 01:01:27.597
- You were followed.
- It's Rochefort.

815
01:01:28.307 --> 01:01:32.769
Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan,

816
01:01:32.812 --> 01:01:36.147
surrender your weapons
and no harm will come to you.

817
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:39.901
The moment they step out,

818
01:01:40.736 --> 01:01:41.986
kill them.

819
01:01:44.156 --> 01:01:45.615
Light the torches!

820
01:01:45.783 --> 01:01:48.410
I'll count to five, then
we'll burn you out!

821
01:01:54.125 --> 01:01:55.208
One!

822
01:01:55.751 --> 01:01:56.751
Two!

823
01:01:57.128 --> 01:01:58.294
Three!

824
01:01:58.838 --> 01:02:00.380
Oh! Sorry! Didn't see you there.

825
01:02:00.464 --> 01:02:01.673
Damn you!

826
01:02:05.845 --> 01:02:06.970
Fire!

827
01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:23.361
Let me guess.

828
01:02:23.446 --> 01:02:25.739
You've come to tell me
that the Musketeers are dead,

829
01:02:25.823 --> 01:02:28.575
our plan is proceeding on schedule,

830
01:02:28.659 --> 01:02:31.536
and I have absolutely, positively,
nothing to worry about.

831
01:02:32.455 --> 01:02:34.831
We were taken by surprise, Your Eminence.

832
01:02:34.999 --> 01:02:37.542
Somehow I was laboring
under the assumption

833
01:02:37.626 --> 01:02:40.587
that the plan was for you
to take them by surprise.

834
01:02:41.547 --> 01:02:44.257
- Was it not?
- Eminence...

835
01:02:44.425 --> 01:02:46.009
Yes, you are quite fond of that word,
aren't you?

836
01:02:46.135 --> 01:02:49.095
Sadly, repeating it
doesn't get you into my good graces.

837
01:02:49.889 --> 01:02:51.723
Alert Milady. Watch the ports.

838
01:02:51.891 --> 01:02:54.601
No one is to leave for England
without my official permission.

839
01:02:55.019 --> 01:02:56.686
Post a bounty on their heads.

840
01:02:56.854 --> 01:02:58.605
The bigger, the better.

841
01:02:58.856 --> 01:03:00.523
Yes, Your Eminence.

842
01:03:00.983 --> 01:03:02.066
Rochefort.

843
01:03:05.362 --> 01:03:07.322
Do not fail me again.

844
01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:21.503
Jussac and a lot of help.
There's no way past.

845
01:03:22.087 --> 01:03:23.546
How the hell did he get here so fast?

846
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:29.719
- Now what?
- We need a distraction.

847
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:31.346
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

848
01:03:31.388 --> 01:03:32.680
I could go.

849
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:34.390
Probably not.

850
01:03:34.517 --> 01:03:35.517
Wrong.

851
01:03:35.559 --> 01:03:38.394
Wrong on all counts.
You'll need every sword where you're going.

852
01:03:38.938 --> 01:03:41.105
I can't help you there, but I can help.

853
01:03:41.565 --> 01:03:43.399
Right here, right now.

854
01:03:43.526 --> 01:03:44.734
- If they catch you...
- They won't.

855
01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:47.445
- If they catch you...
- I'm the Queen's lady-in-waiting.

856
01:03:47.738 --> 01:03:49.614
You, on the other hand,
are a wanted fugitive,

857
01:03:49.865 --> 01:03:52.742
and about to steal
from the most powerful man in England.

858
01:03:53.577 --> 01:03:55.411
Which one of us should be worried?

859
01:03:55.955 --> 01:03:56.955
Go.

860
01:03:57.373 --> 01:03:59.207
Go so that you can come back.

861
01:04:10.928 --> 01:04:12.428
Now give me that hat.

862
01:04:20.062 --> 01:04:21.104
D'Artagnan!

863
01:04:21.188 --> 01:04:22.313
Get after him!

864
01:04:38.956 --> 01:04:39.956
Wait!

865
01:04:43.127 --> 01:04:45.461
The diamonds will be
in Buckingham's personal vault,

866
01:04:45.629 --> 01:04:49.132
located in the lowest, most secure level
of the Tower, next to the crown jewels.

867
01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.259
The lock is state of the art.

868
01:04:51.594 --> 01:04:54.137
Lt requires a key that Buckingham
carries on his person at all times.

869
01:04:54.221 --> 01:04:55.805
Corridor leading up to it is booby-trapped.

870
01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:57.390
Oh, I'm glad that's straightforward.

871
01:04:57.933 --> 01:05:00.727
Tempt anyone
with some bread and cheese, if you...

872
01:05:00.853 --> 01:05:03.229
You hadn't finished the briefing, actually.
I'm so sorry.

873
01:05:03.314 --> 01:05:05.023
Please don't tell me off.

874
01:05:05.482 --> 01:05:07.984
Then it gets worse, a lot worse.

875
01:05:08.152 --> 01:05:10.945
We have to cross three stone walls
and a moat.

876
01:05:11.196 --> 01:05:13.072
And there's just a couple of hundred
highly trained soldiers

877
01:05:13.157 --> 01:05:14.657
with a predilection for not being robbed.

878
01:05:15.159 --> 01:05:18.494
Although, since Buckingham undoubtedly
knows we're coming, thanks to Milady,

879
01:05:18.621 --> 01:05:20.079
that number is likely to be greater.

880
01:05:20.164 --> 01:05:22.999
And why can't we just tell
Buckingham Milady is plotting against him?

881
01:05:23.083 --> 01:05:27.170
Because he wouldn't believe us.
Why should he? We're his sworn enemies.

882
01:05:28.297 --> 01:05:30.757
Besides, Milady would have made sure.

883
01:05:32.551 --> 01:05:33.760
Athos is coming.

884
01:05:35.262 --> 01:05:36.429
Tell me.

885
01:05:37.932 --> 01:05:40.016
What do you suppose he's after?

886
01:05:40.267 --> 01:05:41.893
What does it matter?

887
01:05:42.937 --> 01:05:47.607
Whatever it is, it's merely an excuse.
He wants revenge for Venice.

888
01:05:49.234 --> 01:05:50.735
He wants me.

889
01:05:51.695 --> 01:05:53.446
And he wants you.

890
01:05:56.283 --> 01:05:58.409
We shall have to be ready for him.

891
01:05:59.703 --> 01:06:00.870
Won't we?

892
01:06:02.373 --> 01:06:05.875
We can't outshoot them,
but we can outsmart them.

893
01:06:06.251 --> 01:06:08.795
He'll naturally favor
misdirection and deception.

894
01:06:09.046 --> 01:06:12.799
He knows we're expecting him,
but that just ups the ante.

895
01:06:13.467 --> 01:06:14.884
She knows us.

896
01:06:15.302 --> 01:06:18.388
What we look like, how we move,
how we think.

897
01:06:18.514 --> 01:06:20.890
He'll divide his forces, independent teams,

898
01:06:20.975 --> 01:06:24.102
each with their own point of entry
to maximize their chances.

899
01:06:24.186 --> 01:06:26.270
There are four of us. So we use...

900
01:06:26.355 --> 01:06:29.190
Well, there's five of
us, actually, if you...

901
01:06:31.944 --> 01:06:35.196
He's a skilled diver. He'll take the
aquatic route, through the Traitor's Gate.

902
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:42.412
Aramis will undoubtedly rely
on agility and stealth.

903
01:06:43.163 --> 01:06:45.873
Check every tower, every rooftop.

904
01:06:48.377 --> 01:06:52.422
Porthos, on the other hand,
will employ brute strength.

905
01:06:53.674 --> 01:06:56.259
One of his preferred methods
is getting captured by the opposition.

906
01:07:01.223 --> 01:07:04.475
All the more reason
to take none of them alive.

907
01:07:06.437 --> 01:07:08.187
One more thing.

908
01:07:11.775 --> 01:07:14.527
They may try and drive a wedge between us.

909
01:07:14.862 --> 01:07:16.529
Claim to have secret information

910
01:07:16.613 --> 01:07:19.240
about some plot to get us
to turn against one another,

911
01:07:19.283 --> 01:07:23.661
like, say, I'm a double agent
working for the Cardinal

912
01:07:24.288 --> 01:07:27.248
or you're looking to get rid of me.

913
01:07:29.918 --> 01:07:34.630
I assure you,
nothing could be further from the truth.

914
01:07:37.051 --> 01:07:38.259
Although,

915
01:07:40.971 --> 01:07:44.015
I suppose I should

916
01:07:45.476 --> 01:07:48.603
search you for concealed weapons.

917
01:07:51.482 --> 01:07:52.899
That's how it's done.

918
01:07:54.818 --> 01:07:56.903
And that's exactly what she'll expect.

919
01:07:57.112 --> 01:08:00.406
So we do the unexpected.

920
01:08:01.825 --> 01:08:04.952
We go in broad daylight.
One man, hiding in plain sight.

921
01:08:04.995 --> 01:08:08.539
With all the extra security, there'll be
a lot of new faces, that's their weakness.

922
01:08:08.624 --> 01:08:11.834
And you, D'Artagnan, you're the wild card.

923
01:08:13.378 --> 01:08:15.463
We are the decoys.

924
01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:19.300
Now we'll try and create a distraction,
keep them occupied,

925
01:08:19.343 --> 01:08:21.260
keep them away from you
as much as possible,

926
01:08:21.345 --> 01:08:23.554
but, ultimately, it's down to you.

927
01:08:24.848 --> 01:08:26.808
You wanted to be a Musketeer?

928
01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:28.601
You want to serve France?

929
01:08:29.353 --> 01:08:30.645
This is your chance.

930
01:08:38.487 --> 01:08:41.489
Left, right, left, right, left!

931
01:08:41.865 --> 01:08:42.949
I thought you saw the signal!

932
01:08:43.158 --> 01:08:46.119
- I saw you waving like an idiot!
- Well, that was the bloody signal!

933
01:08:46.203 --> 01:08:47.954
I'm trying to see things
from your point of view,

934
01:08:48.038 --> 01:08:50.498
but, unfortunately,
I can't get my head that far up my ass!

935
01:08:50.582 --> 01:08:52.041
- Up your ass? I'll tell you what...
- Yes!

936
01:08:52.126 --> 01:08:53.417
That's enough of that!

937
01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.421
Finally, good,
at last, a peace officer!

938
01:08:57.548 --> 01:09:00.466
Now listen, Sergeant,
I would like you to arrest this man!

939
01:09:00.551 --> 01:09:01.551
Arrest me?

940
01:09:01.635 --> 01:09:02.927
You can't arrest me!

941
01:09:03.011 --> 01:09:05.388
Don't you tell me that!
I've lost my prized bantam!

942
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:08.432
- Bantams? They are rotten!
- They are not rotten!

943
01:09:32.166 --> 01:09:35.501
Sir! The first of the Musketeers
has been arrested!

944
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:37.920
The game is afoot.

945
01:09:38.505 --> 01:09:42.091
Bring him to me and double the guards.
Double the troops.

946
01:09:43.594 --> 01:09:45.011
Double everything.

947
01:09:45.679 --> 01:09:46.679
Sir!

948
01:09:47.347 --> 01:09:49.515
They'll come to us.

949
01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:52.768
Well, then.

950
01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.646
I think Your Lordship
has everything under control.

951
01:09:56.356 --> 01:09:59.108
You won't mind if I don't stay
to see how it all turns out?

952
01:10:00.736 --> 01:10:03.613
- Do you think I might lose?
- On the contrary.

953
01:10:03.655 --> 01:10:06.449
I have no issues with you killing Athos,

954
01:10:06.491 --> 01:10:08.951
but, if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not watch him die.

955
01:10:12.372 --> 01:10:15.416
Tell me, what's your favorite color?

956
01:10:21.924 --> 01:10:22.965
Red.

957
01:10:23.967 --> 01:10:25.051
Why?

958
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:28.262
I wanted to see
if you were capable of telling the truth.

959
01:10:29.973 --> 01:10:30.973
Hmm.

960
01:10:41.151 --> 01:10:42.693
As far from here as possible.

961
01:10:56.708 --> 01:10:58.334
Well, well, well.

962
01:11:00.754 --> 01:11:03.798
Look at what the cat dragged in.

963
01:11:05.467 --> 01:11:07.551
So, how's the old Athos, eh?

964
01:11:09.471 --> 01:11:12.515
Still his surly,
insufferable self, I'm sure.

965
01:11:12.808 --> 01:11:16.143
Sending a boy to do a man's job.

966
01:11:17.104 --> 01:11:18.938
I should feel insulted.

967
01:11:21.525 --> 01:11:24.110
Well, what were you after anyway, eh?

968
01:11:26.196 --> 01:11:29.573
Secrets, spies, it's all a game, really.

969
01:11:29.866 --> 01:11:33.411
Although the price of loss,
as you'll come to discover,

970
01:11:33.787 --> 01:11:35.663
is a little bit higher.

971
01:11:37.749 --> 01:11:38.833
What?

972
01:11:40.127 --> 01:11:41.502
No last words?

973
01:11:42.796 --> 01:11:43.838
No insults?

974
01:11:44.298 --> 01:11:46.674
- Pleas for mercy or...
- What time is it?

975
01:11:49.219 --> 01:11:53.848
About 2:00, I'd say.
Why? Are you in a hurry?

976
01:11:57.144 --> 01:11:58.686
Look out of the window.

977
01:12:06.236 --> 01:12:08.863
They weren't the decoys. I was.

978
01:12:40.187 --> 01:12:41.270
Ahhh!

979
01:13:14.012 --> 01:13:15.471
Permission to come aboard?

980
01:13:15.514 --> 01:13:16.639
Granted.

981
01:13:34.533 --> 01:13:36.158
Athos!

982
01:13:53.427 --> 01:13:58.013
The wonderful thing about fighting
an imaginary opponent, Captain Rochefort,

983
01:13:58.515 --> 01:14:01.684
is that he's always greatly skilled
yet easily defeated.

984
01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.102
Eminence.

985
01:14:04.438 --> 01:14:07.481
The pride of victory
without the risk of loss.

986
01:14:08.442 --> 01:14:11.152
I trust you didn't come here to impress me
with your swordsmanship.

987
01:14:11.403 --> 01:14:14.321
No, Your Eminence. I have some good news.

988
01:14:15.365 --> 01:14:16.449
Such as?

989
01:14:31.631 --> 01:14:35.176
So what about the diamonds?
Doesn't Buckingham still have them?

990
01:14:35.218 --> 01:14:36.302
Nope.

991
01:14:37.179 --> 01:14:38.679
Milady likes hedging her bets.

992
01:14:38.722 --> 01:14:39.722
She'd never have taken the chance

993
01:14:39.806 --> 01:14:41.390
we'd actually succeed
in breaking into the vault.

994
01:14:43.101 --> 01:14:44.852
So where are they now?

995
01:14:45.228 --> 01:14:47.688
With the only person she trusts.

996
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:55.488
Which means we've lost her
and all this has been for nothing.

997
01:14:55.572 --> 01:14:57.114
I wouldn't say that.

998
01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.789
You were the decoy, we were the extraction,

999
01:15:05.874 --> 01:15:09.335
but the real linchpin of the plan, well,

1000
01:15:10.212 --> 01:15:12.171
that was someone else entirely.

1001
01:15:15.467 --> 01:15:17.968
Someone even Milady would never suspect.

1002
01:15:22.933 --> 01:15:25.267
Driver! What the hell is going on?

1003
01:15:25.352 --> 01:15:28.479
Just following your instructions, ma'am.
"As far away from here as possible."

1004
01:15:58.134 --> 01:15:59.885
Whoo-hoo!

1005
01:16:12.566 --> 01:16:15.818
Planchet. Never thought
I'd hear myself say this, but

1006
01:16:16.528 --> 01:16:17.528
well done.

1007
01:16:18.154 --> 01:16:19.154
Thank you, sir.

1008
01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.824
That means a lot,
especially coming from you.

1009
01:16:21.866 --> 01:16:22.950
Shut up, Planchet.

1010
01:16:23.034 --> 01:16:24.159
Yes, sir.

1011
01:16:31.543 --> 01:16:32.668
Don't.

1012
01:16:35.964 --> 01:16:38.299
We took the precaution
of removing the gunpowder.

1013
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:46.515
What now?

1014
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:50.144
You give me the diamonds
or I take them off your corpse.

1015
01:16:50.186 --> 01:16:51.520
Dealer's choice.

1016
01:16:55.025 --> 01:16:57.443
- Anything else you'd like me to take off?
- Outside.

1017
01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:11.665
Boys.

1018
01:17:12.542 --> 01:17:13.917
Been a while.

1019
01:17:17.255 --> 01:17:19.048
This must be the young Gascon.

1020
01:17:20.216 --> 01:17:21.550
We've met before.

1021
01:17:23.178 --> 01:17:24.178
Ah, yes.

1022
01:17:24.846 --> 01:17:26.805
Small world.

1023
01:17:28.892 --> 01:17:30.851
I didn't let Rochefort kill you.

1024
01:17:32.312 --> 01:17:34.438
You do remember that, don't you?

1025
01:17:41.988 --> 01:17:44.406
- Did you kill Buckingham?
- No.

1026
01:17:45.367 --> 01:17:47.451
- But you will kill me?
- Yes.

1027
01:17:50.789 --> 01:17:52.247
You would spare him, but kill me?

1028
01:17:52.582 --> 01:17:55.167
Yes. I don't hate Buckingham.

1029
01:18:04.427 --> 01:18:05.552
Here.

1030
01:18:06.262 --> 01:18:07.971
You may find use for this.

1031
01:18:11.226 --> 01:18:12.476
Move.

1032
01:18:46.428 --> 01:18:47.469
Athos.

1033
01:19:05.989 --> 01:19:10.159
At least she died the way she lived,
on her own terms.

1034
01:19:13.621 --> 01:19:15.205
She did it for me.

1035
01:19:17.208 --> 01:19:21.462
I wouldn't have been able to live
with myself had I pulled the trigger.

1036
01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:25.674
Come on, let's go home.

1037
01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:40.773
But I can't get it.

1038
01:19:41.357 --> 01:19:42.858
How marvelous!

1039
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:47.196
Oh! So great!

1040
01:19:54.829 --> 01:19:56.705
Oh!

1041
01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.875
Your Majesty.

1042
01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:01.543
My dear.

1043
01:20:02.212 --> 01:20:03.712
You look troubled.

1044
01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.840
Hardly. Your Majesty just startled me.

1045
01:20:07.592 --> 01:20:09.092
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1046
01:20:09.552 --> 01:20:12.054
I just wanted to drop by

1047
01:20:12.138 --> 01:20:13.972
and tell you how much
I was looking forward to tonight.

1048
01:20:15.058 --> 01:20:19.561
Should be quite spectacular, you know.
Costumes, fireworks and such.

1049
01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.772
But you,

1050
01:20:23.441 --> 01:20:25.859
you shall be
the most spectacular sight of all.

1051
01:20:26.986 --> 01:20:29.446
And especially since
you'll wear the diamonds.

1052
01:20:29.906 --> 01:20:31.949
You will wear them, won't you?

1053
01:20:33.576 --> 01:20:35.994
Well, it's very important
to me that you do.

1054
01:20:38.122 --> 01:20:40.374
Then I shall wear them, Your Majesty.

1055
01:20:41.918 --> 01:20:43.126
Until tonight, then.

1056
01:20:53.137 --> 01:20:54.763
She promised she'll wear them.

1057
01:20:56.432 --> 01:20:58.267
You do think she'll wear them,
don't you, Richelieu?

1058
01:20:59.018 --> 01:21:01.395
I'm sure she will, Your Majesty.

1059
01:21:01.604 --> 01:21:03.105
I'm sure she will.

1060
01:21:31.384 --> 01:21:33.135
I hate air travel!

1061
01:21:48.359 --> 01:21:49.443
Damn!

1062
01:22:19.682 --> 01:22:21.683
Hard to starboard!

1063
01:22:36.115 --> 01:22:37.407
Well, now that we have their attention,

1064
01:22:37.492 --> 01:22:39.701
let's see if we can settle this
in a peaceful manner.

1065
01:22:40.286 --> 01:22:41.745
More or less.

1066
01:22:43.748 --> 01:22:45.624
Ah, Gascon!

1067
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:49.211
So you've traded up
when it comes to transport.

1068
01:22:49.671 --> 01:22:51.171
But, once again, you're outmatched.

1069
01:22:51.547 --> 01:22:53.382
You can thank Milady for that.

1070
01:22:53.466 --> 01:22:56.343
She passed on Buckingham's plans
a long time ago.

1071
01:22:56.427 --> 01:22:59.012
As you can see,
we made some improvements.

1072
01:23:01.015 --> 01:23:02.224
Isn't she a beauty?

1073
01:23:02.392 --> 01:23:03.684
What do you want?

1074
01:23:05.937 --> 01:23:07.020
The diamonds.

1075
01:23:07.563 --> 01:23:09.398
- Come and take them.
- Gladly!

1076
01:23:10.233 --> 01:23:13.360
You see, I can blast you out of the sky
with total impunity.

1077
01:23:13.444 --> 01:23:14.778
If you fire on me, on the other hand,

1078
01:23:14.862 --> 01:23:16.989
you'll be killing
Miss Oh-so-young-and-pretty.

1079
01:23:20.368 --> 01:23:22.411
You have 60 seconds.

1080
01:23:24.372 --> 01:23:26.206
He'll shoot us down
the moment he has the diamonds.

1081
01:23:26.249 --> 01:23:27.290
We can't outrun them.

1082
01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:28.917
And we can't fight them, damn it! We can't.

1083
01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.253
- Oh, D'Artagnan.
- What?

1084
01:23:31.546 --> 01:23:34.381
Do you think
you have the monopoly on loss?

1085
01:23:34.549 --> 01:23:35.716
What if she dies?

1086
01:23:35.758 --> 01:23:37.300
The life of one woman
or the future of France,

1087
01:23:37.427 --> 01:23:39.302
what would you do
if you were in my position?

1088
01:23:41.764 --> 01:23:44.266
I've made a lot of sacrifices,
a lot of hard choices.

1089
01:23:44.434 --> 01:23:47.436
For honor, for King, for country.
You wanna know what I've learned, boy?

1090
01:23:47.478 --> 01:23:50.605
Hard choices and sacrifices
do not keep you warm at night.

1091
01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:55.068
Life is too damn short and too damn long
to go through without someone at your side.

1092
01:23:55.111 --> 01:23:56.778
Don't end up like me.

1093
01:23:57.655 --> 01:24:00.949
Choose the woman.
Fight for love, D'Artagnan.

1094
01:24:01.784 --> 01:24:03.785
France will take care of itself.

1095
01:24:05.705 --> 01:24:06.955
Time's up!

1096
01:24:10.585 --> 01:24:11.626
An exchange.

1097
01:24:12.795 --> 01:24:16.048
I go aboard your ship with the diamonds,
the girl comes aboard ours.

1098
01:24:16.716 --> 01:24:18.258
Once I know she's safe,

1099
01:24:18.968 --> 01:24:20.802
I give them to you.

1100
01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:24.806
Fine. But I want to see the diamonds first.

1101
01:24:25.558 --> 01:24:26.725
Planchet.

1102
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:30.812
Cut her loose.

1103
01:24:33.149 --> 01:24:35.650
- Deploy the gangway!
- Deploy the gangway!

1104
01:24:45.578 --> 01:24:46.661
Satisfied?

1105
01:25:32.542 --> 01:25:34.543
You never learn, do you?

1106
01:25:41.843 --> 01:25:42.884
Fire!

1107
01:25:47.974 --> 01:25:49.057
Hard right!

1108
01:25:49.559 --> 01:25:51.159
Fire!

1109
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:21.923
Good.

1110
01:26:22.508 --> 01:26:24.593
I really want you to see this.

1111
01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.052
Finish them off!

1112
01:26:28.264 --> 01:26:30.265
We can't outrun them
and we can't outgun them.

1113
01:26:30.391 --> 01:26:33.226
We could try asking them to surrender,
but somehow I don't think it would work.

1114
01:26:33.269 --> 01:26:35.103
We hide. In there.

1115
01:26:42.361 --> 01:26:43.612
Fire!

1116
01:26:43.779 --> 01:26:44.946
Fire!

1117
01:27:03.549 --> 01:27:04.799
Lay in a pursuit course!

1118
01:27:04.967 --> 01:27:07.260
Lay in a pursuit course!

1119
01:27:07.303 --> 01:27:08.428
Fire!

1120
01:27:13.976 --> 01:27:15.769
He's persistent, I'll give him that!

1121
01:27:17.313 --> 01:27:18.313
Fire!

1122
01:27:22.652 --> 01:27:25.695
But, sir! We can't go into the storm!

1123
01:27:30.034 --> 01:27:31.076
Anyone?

1124
01:27:31.661 --> 01:27:34.120
Anyone else who wants to question orders?

1125
01:27:36.666 --> 01:27:37.749
Good.

1126
01:27:53.557 --> 01:27:57.477
Sir, now might be a good time
to talk about the possibility of a raise?

1127
01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.687
Shut up, Planchet.

1128
01:27:58.813 --> 01:28:00.021
Yes, sir.

1129
01:28:17.832 --> 01:28:18.873
Where are they?

1130
01:28:21.544 --> 01:28:23.420
You're never gonna find them in there.

1131
01:28:24.213 --> 01:28:26.006
I beg to differ.

1132
01:28:41.981 --> 01:28:43.815
Keep after them!

1133
01:28:43.983 --> 01:28:46.067
I'll take the Gascon!

1134
01:28:47.903 --> 01:28:49.154
Hard to starboard!

1135
01:29:16.849 --> 01:29:18.683
You know what your problem is, boy?

1136
01:29:18.768 --> 01:29:23.021
You read too many books,
and then you believed them.

1137
01:29:24.273 --> 01:29:26.149
Courage, honor.

1138
01:29:27.318 --> 01:29:28.443
All for one.

1139
01:29:29.445 --> 01:29:32.530
But history isn't written by heroes,
it's written by victors.

1140
01:29:32.865 --> 01:29:34.657
Keep your eyes open!

1141
01:29:44.627 --> 01:29:46.002
Round two.

1142
01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:47.295
Oh...

1143
01:29:57.848 --> 01:29:59.349
Return fire!

1144
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:10.360
Pull up, damn it!

1145
01:30:10.528 --> 01:30:11.694
We're too heavy!

1146
01:30:13.489 --> 01:30:15.698
You scared to take me in a fair fight?

1147
01:30:17.034 --> 01:30:18.284
Hardly.

1148
01:30:19.203 --> 01:30:20.912
I just don't fight fair.

1149
01:30:22.873 --> 01:30:27.752
Captain Rochefort!

1150
01:30:28.671 --> 01:30:29.712
Oh, well.

1151
01:30:47.231 --> 01:30:48.690
Drop the ballast!

1152
01:30:48.941 --> 01:30:50.316
Drop everything!

1153
01:30:50.734 --> 01:30:52.444
And fire up the burners!

1154
01:30:52.528 --> 01:30:54.237
Over the side!

1155
01:30:55.156 --> 01:30:56.573
Drop those barrels!

1156
01:30:56.740 --> 01:30:58.658
Faster! Move!

1157
01:31:10.504 --> 01:31:11.629
Shall we?

1158
01:31:21.849 --> 01:31:22.974
Hold on!

1159
01:31:27.313 --> 01:31:28.438
Get out of the way!

1160
01:31:29.732 --> 01:31:31.232
Go! Run!

1161
01:32:43.764 --> 01:32:47.433
I still have the diamonds.
What do you propose to do about that?

1162
01:32:47.977 --> 01:32:49.060
Kill you.

1163
01:32:57.570 --> 01:32:58.987
If you insist.

1164
01:33:08.872 --> 01:33:09.998
Oh!

1165
01:35:31.098 --> 01:35:32.807
You should've stayed in Gascony, boy.

1166
01:35:41.483 --> 01:35:44.026
You should've apologized to my horse.

1167
01:36:18.729 --> 01:36:21.689
Surround the palace!
Shoot the Musketeers on sight!

1168
01:36:21.732 --> 01:36:25.359
Use every man at your disposal!
Any means necessary!

1169
01:36:25.527 --> 01:36:27.278
- Your Eminence!
- Don't interrupt!

1170
01:36:27.446 --> 01:36:29.280
These men must not...

1171
01:36:55.265 --> 01:36:56.599
Arrest these men!

1172
01:37:04.233 --> 01:37:05.274
What is the meaning of this?

1173
01:37:07.319 --> 01:37:09.070
Your Majesty, these men...

1174
01:37:09.154 --> 01:37:12.406
Are delivering a gift for Your Majesty.
Compliments of the Cardinal.

1175
01:37:14.117 --> 01:37:16.577
Cardinal, you shouldn't have.

1176
01:37:18.914 --> 01:37:22.542
Well, Your Majesty did ask me
to get you one of those, so...

1177
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:24.293
So I did.

1178
01:37:27.506 --> 01:37:29.340
But what happened to it?

1179
01:37:29.675 --> 01:37:32.176
Buckingham's spy, Rochefort,
attempted to sabotage the craft.

1180
01:37:32.261 --> 01:37:34.095
- He's been dealt with.
- Rochefort?

1181
01:37:34.805 --> 01:37:36.639
He's Captain of your guards, isn't he?

1182
01:37:36.807 --> 01:37:37.849
Actually,

1183
01:37:38.225 --> 01:37:41.644
His Eminence was the one
who uncovered the traitor.

1184
01:37:45.524 --> 01:37:48.526
"lt is by my order
and for the good of the State

1185
01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:52.738
"that the bearer of this
has done what has been done."

1186
01:37:54.324 --> 01:37:57.910
- That's your signature, isn't it, Richelieu?
- It would appear so, Your Majesty.

1187
01:37:58.078 --> 01:37:59.996
Well, let me get this right.

1188
01:38:00.163 --> 01:38:04.750
You brought me an airship
and exposed a snake in our midst?

1189
01:38:05.335 --> 01:38:07.420
How can I ever repay you?

1190
01:38:07.588 --> 01:38:09.505
I could think of a few ways.

1191
01:38:10.757 --> 01:38:11.757
Anne.

1192
01:38:13.135 --> 01:38:15.469
I was just returning from the jewelers.

1193
01:38:18.473 --> 01:38:20.433
Well, I realize it's a little early,

1194
01:38:21.101 --> 01:38:23.644
but the orchestra's here and so are we.

1195
01:38:24.646 --> 01:38:26.814
Would Your Majesty care to dance?

1196
01:38:27.399 --> 01:38:28.941
I would love to.

1197
01:38:32.112 --> 01:38:33.988
Well, mind out, you fellows!

1198
01:38:34.281 --> 01:38:35.448
D'Artagnan.

1199
01:38:36.491 --> 01:38:37.491
Well, well, well.

1200
01:38:39.411 --> 01:38:42.163
Looks like you aren't the only one
who gets the girl.

1201
01:38:42.331 --> 01:38:44.457
Your Majesty is a natural.

1202
01:38:45.751 --> 01:38:47.043
Guess I am.

1203
01:38:48.128 --> 01:38:49.837
As a matter of fact,

1204
01:38:50.005 --> 01:38:53.424
I think you'll start noticing
a few more changes around here.

1205
01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:55.760
Thank you.

1206
01:38:57.679 --> 01:38:58.888
For everything.

1207
01:38:59.139 --> 01:39:00.431
Any time.

1208
01:39:02.351 --> 01:39:03.601
Well, strike up, then!

1209
01:39:03.769 --> 01:39:04.977
Your Majesty!

1210
01:39:05.604 --> 01:39:07.229
Positions, please, gentlemen!

1211
01:39:12.653 --> 01:39:13.778
Well-played.

1212
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:25.289
I could use men like you.

1213
01:39:30.754 --> 01:39:31.837
I already have a job.

1214
01:39:31.922 --> 01:39:34.215
- I'm a drunk.
- I'm independently wealthy.

1215
01:39:34.383 --> 01:39:36.050
Thanks, but no.

1216
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:40.596
The day will come
when you'll wish you had said, "Yes".

1217
01:39:40.764 --> 01:39:41.889
Maybe.

1218
01:39:42.057 --> 01:39:43.265
But not today.

1219
01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.393
Maybe not today.

1220
01:39:56.405 --> 01:39:57.446
Enjoying the show?

1221
01:39:57.739 --> 01:39:59.573
Are you always this cocky?

1222
01:39:59.741 --> 01:40:01.075
Only on Tuesdays

1223
01:40:01.118 --> 01:40:03.452
and whenever beautiful women are involved.

1224
01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:05.579
So you think I'm beautiful.

1225
01:40:06.957 --> 01:40:08.666
Actually, it's Tuesday.

1226
01:40:35.444 --> 01:40:38.487
- So, what now?
- We drink.

1227
01:40:38.947 --> 01:40:39.947
And then what?

1228
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:43.242
Wherever they send us.
Whatever France needs.

1229
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:46.328
I thought you didn't believe
in that stuff anymore.

1230
01:40:47.497 --> 01:40:48.998
I believe in us.

1231
01:40:49.791 --> 01:40:51.167
Till the day I stop believing that,

1232
01:40:51.293 --> 01:40:54.628
there are still things in this world
worth fighting and dying for.

1233
01:41:00.594 --> 01:41:01.677
All for one!

1234
01:41:01.762 --> 01:41:03.304
And one for all!

1235
01:41:05.098 --> 01:41:06.807
