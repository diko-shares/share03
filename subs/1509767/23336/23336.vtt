1
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:03,168
We're screwed, yaar, SCREWED!

2
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:06,268
We're SO screwed!

3
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,701
His own dad wouldn't trust..

4
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:11,602
..that Baldie, how could you?

5
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,802
How much can we run? Hurry!

6
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:14,703
Give me a second. Dammit!

7
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,100
Sachin, look!

8
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,269
Zaramud could have
picked any car.

9
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,202
There was a Lancer, Accent,
Toyota And a simple Esteem too.

10
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:27,468
But the moron went for the Benz.

11
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:30,135
lf we gotta run, we gotta
do it in style!

12
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:43,504
lt's an automatic. What are you,
Feroz Khan from Qurbani?

13
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,568
There are no gears!

14
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,701
AUTOMATIC? l can't drive
an automatic!

15
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:50,501
What are you stopping for?

16
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:53,168
l don't know, it's automatic!

17
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,868
Move it, move it! Go, go, go!

18
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:58,201
The truck's gonna ram into us-

19
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,668
They call us the linewallas.

20
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,901
You want to splurge on a mobile
but not pay the bill, come to us.

21
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,534
don't want to pay the
bill, come to us.

22
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,769
We will set you up with
a duplicate SIM card.

23
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:06,768
Our source for raw materials
is pretty simple too.

24
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:09,635
Lamington Road. The Microsoft
of Mumbai.

25
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:12,535
You get every damn
software there.

26
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:14,768
Even the ones not made yet!

27
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:17,802
This is how it is, get the
software.Get anybody's SIM card.

28
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,301
And clone it.

29
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,035
We're ready with the card. The
customer, with the cash

30
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,034
l'm making this international
call from..

31
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,834
..my mobile! What do
you think, huh?

32
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:29,602
Have a blast! And why not.

33
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,368
lt's someone else's SIM card!

34
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,034
Talk all you want.

35
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,403
After a month, chuck the SIM.

36
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,468
And is the original
SIM owner in..

37
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:40,834
..for a shock when
he sees the bill!

38
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,335
Never trust a guy
you don't know.

39
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:45,734
That's the rule of our game!

40
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,568
Who told you about us?

41
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,568
Yeah? Yeah.

42
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,467
Yeah?

43
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,435
And we broke that rule
and dealt with Baldie.

44
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,634
Use it within limits.

45
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:06,468
Thank you. Sachin-bhai..

46
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,336
..l got my hands on
a brand new model.

47
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:13,602
A gift from me to you.

48
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:16,434
We don't use mobile phones.

49
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,469
They're bad for health. The
radiation causes cancer.

50
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:22,267
Put it here, your
brain is screwed.

51
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:23,734
Put it in your pocket,
your heart is screwed.

52
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,868
And if you put it here. -Your
next generation is screwed!

53
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:28,468
God knows what Baldie
did with the SIM.

54
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,401
Maybe his whole neighbourhood
had a go on the phone.

55
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,568
Or maybe he spent wild nights
on adult hotlines!

56
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,702
He rang up a bill of nine
Iakhs in one week!

57
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,801
The phone company
went into shock!

58
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,736
They dialed 1-O-O
and screwed us.

59
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,901
Zaramud, wake up.
We are screwed!

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,335
Wake up! Wake up, fatass!

61
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:47,801
Run! Break everything and run!

62
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:49,501
Sachin, calm down..

63
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,335
Baldie blabbed about
us to the cops.

64
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,468
They know all about
us! We have to run!

65
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:55,567
And trash everything.

66
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,868
Can't leave this photo behind,
they'll identify us.

67
00:06:57,966 --> 00:06:59,467
One minute.

68
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:02,435
Where in hell did
you find Baldie?

69
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,501
We gotta destroy everything!

70
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,668
Okay-okay-okay!

71
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,834
What do you think you're doing?

72
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,235
What about the data? What if the
cops get their hands on it?

73
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:40,201
Sachin, run!

74
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,368
Bad iudgement. Bad shot.

75
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,300
We gave an easy catch,
but it was dropped.

76
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:56,934
We got lucky, call it a 'life# 

77
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,334
Luckily, nothing happened to me.

78
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:02,268
Of course, nothing ever happens
to Fatass anyway.

79
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:04,134
No point looking for ones
and twos in life.

80
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:06,234
We have to hit a
century in life.

81
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,167
We have to do something big.

82
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,868
What will you do?

83
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,201
Something exciting..
Something big..

84
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,069
How about a multiplex?

85
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:19,800
Maybe something smaller.

86
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,668
Something like a.. coffee-shop.

87
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,434
What? Like a tea-stall, you
want to be a 'Thambi'?

88
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,767
l'm not talking about
a Madras Cafe.

89
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,734
l'm thinking.. a cool ioint,

90
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,701
where friends greet,
Iovers meet..

91
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,801
and between them,
a cup of coffee.

92
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:37,602
Here, Thambi, one tea
for me, please.

93
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,401
l'll open my coffee-shop
one day.

94
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,068
The telephone company
reports that the..

95
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,635
SIM cloning racket has been
going on for a while.

96
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:50,369
lt is believed that two
criminals are responsible.

97
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,334
But where are they?
Who are they?

98
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:55,769
Let's ask our special witness.

99
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,568
lt was raining computers!

100
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:00,367
Computer here, computer there..

101
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,434
..computer everywhere!

102
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,234
Did you get a look
at the criminals?

103
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,535
Oh yes, there were two of them.

104
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,201
Like Laurel and Hardy.

105
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,701
What were you doing
at that time?

106
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,302
Er.. l was.. um.. taking a leak.

107
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,635
The cops were behind
us in full force.

108
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,535
But the real problem
Iay ahead of us.

109
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,269
The man whose carwe stole in
style and smashed in style -

110
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,468
l can't call him a bastard,
that's too decent for him.

111
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,769
His name is AGM.
A Mumbai bookie.

112
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,202
He will hurt us as much
as we hurt his car.

113
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,301
He will rip us apart.

114
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,335
Find them, tear them to pieces!

115
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,235
Rip, tear.. what's
the difference!

116
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,768
lt is us he's talking
about anyway!

117
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,768
What, you're waiting for
a formal letter? Scram!

118
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:46,001
Did the hippo say anything
about the money?

119
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:50,168
AGM-bhai. Shut it, you ape!

120
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:53,069
Hey! Can't you see l'm working
here? Keep it down!

121
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,568
Where is the money?
l don't have any.

122
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:58,368
No?

123
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,234
The doctor is getting
an operation.

124
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:05,534
Now, we're going to get one!

125
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,501
You completely screwed my car,
but you're both in one piece!

126
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:59,002
This -key -is all that's left!

127
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:03,435
Now where will l put it?

128
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,667
Sir..

129
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,001
Shut up, moron!

130
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:11,001
Answer only when asked.

131
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,335
Who was driving the car?

132
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,401
He was. -He was.

133
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,300
Shut up!

134
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:19,601
Sir, l really don't know.
It all happened suddenly.

135
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,568
Anyway sir, we'll buy
you a new car.

136
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,301
What colour do you prefer?

137
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:27,102
You scum! No bank will give you
a loan to buy even a bicycle,

138
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:30,034
You'll buy me a car?

139
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,702
You caused the damage,
now you make amends.

140
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,967
l can give you some discount.
Thank you, sir.

141
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:38,666
30 lakh rupees.

142
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,568
Huh? Thirty?

143
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,269
Err, it wasn't a plane,
just a car.

144
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:48,235
l'll shove a plane
down your throat!

145
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:52,003
That car was precious for bhai.

146
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:54,068
He confiscated it from
a famous cricketer.

147
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,568
Did l ask you to interrupt,
dimwit? Shut it.

148
00:11:57,933 --> 00:11:59,567
So where was l?

149
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:02,635
You'll pay for the damages.
So, 40 lakh.

150
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,436
Sir, you iust said 30!

151
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,103
50. Open your mouth again,
it will go up to 60!

152
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,869
Zaramud, shut up. Zara what?

153
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,868
Zaramud. Mood what?

154
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:17,368
That's his name. It's
a long story.

155
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:20,035
lt's my nickname.

156
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,436
As a kid, l used to ask girls
if they were in the mood-

157
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,234
Shut up!

158
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:31,202
Listen, numskull. You're
just petty thieves.

159
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:33,634
Where will you get money from?
That's what we're trying to say.

160
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,134
l have a payment plan for you.

161
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,568
This is how it's gonna be.

162
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,468
From now on you work for me.

163
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:43,334
You do whatever l say.

164
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:47,336
Say no, and l'll make mincemeat
of you and throw a party.

165
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,301
And that's how we had
our career change.

166
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:52,669
We were our own masters, now we
are slaves to someone else.

167
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,669
So long as AGM has the ball,
forget scoring a century,

168
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:57,668
it's hard enough sticking
around on the pitch.

169
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:00,134
What am l doing here?

170
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:04,803
Y2K conference. Y2K..
it's all bullshit.

171
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:06,867
l should be at home

172
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:10,169
Watching TV, betting on
the cricket match.

173
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,936
Should l bet? Yes, maybe.

174
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,002
God, show me a signal.

175
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,535
Some signal. Anysignal.

176
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:26,467
lf this label comes
off in one piece

177
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,568
lf the waiter doesn't
trip over the wire

178
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,267
lf the marker doesn't fall

179
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,134
Great!

180
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,334
Three signs!

181
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,201
Now l have to bet!

182
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,936
You see, l have a
theory on Luck.

183
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:08,068
Everyone has the same
amount of Luck..

184
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:10,901
..iust at different times.

185
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:14,802
You iust have to identify the
time when it is your time.

186
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:19,401
For that, there are signs..

187
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,801
..you need to look for.

188
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:26,967
Get what l'm saying?

189
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:34,834
Who the hell are you?

190
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:39,937
l iust told you.. l'm from
Delhi. My name's Rahul.

191
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,535
l'm in Mumbai for a conference.

192
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,767
l thought l'd stop by and bet

193
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,201
This look like a department
store to you?

194
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:50,034
You think you can iust
waltz in here?

195
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,102
Err, l iust came to place a bet.

196
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:55,101
Who the hell told you about me?

197
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,001
Bhuval Ram Kuber.

198
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:59,401
How much filth will you
spread in Delhi?

199
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,135
You can't afford a cigarette,
but you jumped to gamble!

200
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,835
You want to bet like a tiger..

201
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:07,335
..but you hide like a
rat when you lose!

202
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,468
Kuber-ii, l beg you, give
me two more days.

203
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,435
Just two days? That's all?

204
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,402
As you wish. Till then
l'll pick up..

205
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:17,402
..your TV, then your wife

206
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:20,035
Don't lie, God will punish you.

207
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,034
Just two days, Kuber-ii.

208
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,335
Dimple, shut this thing up

209
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,268
Hello!

210
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,935
Hello, Bhuval Ram Kuber this
side. Who is speaking?

211
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,901
Your mother's husband!

212
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,235
Hello.

213
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,901
Hello.

214
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:38,835
lf you say hello once more, l'll
stuff the phone down your throat!

215
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:40,801
Oh! AGM-bhai. Jai Hind!

216
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:43,368
l was iust thinking
about you and

217
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:46,302
Cut the crap. Do you
know a Rahul?

218
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:52,104
l know half-a-dozen Rahuls,
each worse than the other.

219
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,469
This one says you referred
me to him, for betting.

220
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,036
Oh, the one that talks
all that theory crap?

221
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,835
Yeah, he was giving
me the crap too.

222
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,935
What's his credit?

223
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,934
But he has a car, a house. Guess
he's worth around 20-25 lakh.

224
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,669
He begged me for a reference
in Mumbai.

225
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,202
So l referred you to him.

226
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,304
So you want to bet? Which team?

227
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,002
lndia. -How much?

228
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,367
Four lakhs.

229
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,035
What? It takes at least 20
Iakhs to bet in Bombay.

230
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:33,202
20 lakhs! That's way too much.

231
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,969
You've been chewing my head
with your stupid theory.

232
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:39,134
What happened to your signs now?

233
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,201
Don't you have confidence
in your own theory?

234
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,668
What are you afraid of?
-No no, 20 is too much.

235
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:47,034
What can you get with 4 lakhs?

236
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,968
Put in 20 and if India
wins, you win crores.

237
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,969
And you'll get your winnings
immediately.

238
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,335
Even if you lose, l'll give you
three months to pay back.

239
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,301
Usually l don't even
give a week.

240
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,601
Bhiku! Yes sir.

241
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,334
Make a new account for
this gentleman.

242
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,535
What's your bet?

243
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,101
Taxi!

244
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,935
New Zealand has won the
match by 48 runs.

245
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,068
The series is leveled at 2-2.

246
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:48,469
We now have to wait and see
who'll win the decider.

247
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:58,469
Every cricket match is fixed
one way or the other.

248
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,703
You mean to say this series was
fixed before it even started?

249
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,735
Yes. Of the five
matches, India..

250
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:08,501
..wins two and New
Zealand wins two.

251
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:10,534
The final will be
decided in Delhi.

252
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,601
All this was decided before
the series even started.

253
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,568
There are two religions in
India: Films and Cricket.

254
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,968
Whether every film
has a script or..

255
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,201
..not, every match surely
has a script.

256
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,068
Year 2000.

257
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,068
The calendar has also
scored a century..

258
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:33,135
century but AGM hasn't
even let us bat.

259
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,935
Seems like Internet
is the new fad.

260
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,535
These new post offices are
mushrooming everywhere.

261
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,834
Zaramud says there is
a lot of money..

262
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:46,170
..in this but l think
this will also pass.

263
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:47,967
Unlike 'my coffee-shop# 

264
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,602
And now this AGM has also opened
an Internet center.

265
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,701
lnternet, come here!

266
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:55,401
lnternet's iust a front..

267
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:56,967
..The real deal is upstairs.

268
00:19:57,033 --> 00:20:00,169
Betting, gambling,
debt collection..

269
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,502
There is no emailing going on
here, just a lot of scamming.

270
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,634
What new crap is this?

271
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,802
lt's not crap, it's
an Excel sheet.

272
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:11,035
l have 'sorted' everything.

273
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,567
You did what?

274
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:16,635
All the receivables are
organized in descending order.

275
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,035
This is the list of people
that owe you money.

276
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,567
The right column is the
principal amount..

277
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,101
..and the left is the interest.

278
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:23,800
Did you see that, you moron?

279
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:26,168
How many times have l
told you to study!

280
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,101
Are you really an Engineer?

281
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:30,667
Well, l could have been one.

282
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:32,434
l went to college for a year,
but in the second year

283
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,602
Hang on. l prepared this list.

284
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,435
Whatever. There is no prize
distribution going on here.

285
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:39,401
We got work to do.

286
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:42,002
And bones to break of whoever
that hasn't paid up.

287
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,834
Start with this one.

288
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,001
What you staring at, ass? Dial
Kewal Pandey's number, now.

289
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:49,001
Kewal Pandey? -He's a bloody
Bhojpuri actor..

290
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:50,500
..but thinks he's
a Hollywood star.

291
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,702
Sir, he disconnected the call.

292
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,002
How dare he? He cuts AGM's call?

293
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,867
He thinks l'm an idiot?

294
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:13,701
And this one, another
Ioser from Delhi.

295
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,869
Go ahead, have a sweet.
-No sir, l'm on diet.

296
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:20,768
l can see that! What
was l saying?

297
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:24,569
Yes, this loser had come from
Delhi with his calculations.

298
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,035
Said his calculations
are never wrong.

299
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:29,735
But his calculator stopped
working just in my case.

300
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,134
Did l crack a ioke, you idiot?

301
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:34,468
Dial his number now. l
don't have his number.

302
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,901
Take it, take it.

303
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:39,434
This bugger too never
picks up his phone.

304
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:40,800
Every time some chick comes on..

305
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,467
..line and blabbers something
in English.

306
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,902
l'm going to stop giving loans
to people outside Mumbai.

307
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,534
There you go, it's
the chick again.

308
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,501
Sir, it's an answering machine.

309
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:54,967
You need to leave a message
after the beep

310
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,967
After what? -Beep. -Leave what?

311
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,301
Message. -Oh message, okay.

312
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:02,535
AGM this is, calling
from Bombay city.

313
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,269
Mumbai. Yes, Mumbai city.

314
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,702
Back call. Number

315
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:13,369
6497272.

316
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:17,903
Call back. Good night. Bye.
Do the 'take care# 

317
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,868
l'll slap you so hard, Ganpati
will pop out of your ears.

318
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:27,702
Listen Engineer, l want
mymoney back.

319
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:30,702
Do what you have to. Break
his legs, arms, whatever.

320
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,569
Just get me my money, with
interest. Is that clear?

321
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:37,002
What happend? -You
mean.. l am going?

322
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,634
Yes. -But why me?

323
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,835
You have so many men,
send one of them.

324
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,535
These bloody losers are
good for nothing.

325
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,801
Stop acting and get working.

326
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,601
lf you don't want to go alone..

327
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,335
..take this thing along. -No
no! l don't like Delhi.

328
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,668
l'll die of heat in October
and of cold in March.

329
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:59,403
Cold in March? -They are all
cheats. -Bloody thieves.

330
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,834
Look away for a moment
and your bags vanish.

331
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,669
Big-time showoffs too! They go
around in flashy red cars.

332
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,501
Crank up their stereos.

333
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:07,901
Play Bhangra remixes with their
windows rolled down.

334
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:10,001
And there is no variety
in women.

335
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,534
What do they call them?

336
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,002
DTM. 'Down-market Turned Modern'

337
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:15,701
Like l said no variety..1

338
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:17,567
..iust two names: Pooia or Neha.

339
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,667
You will go to Delhi!

340
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:34,867
All in.

341
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,434
l'll match your bet.

342
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,203
And raise by another lakh.

343
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:06,835
l am sure you are
bluffing. 1000/o.

344
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:09,568
You are not that good a player.

345
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:11,735
Just give me a sign.
Anything. Ah!

346
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:14,369
Ruffle your hair, clear
your throat.

347
00:24:21,766 --> 00:24:24,802
l need two lakhs. l'll return
it in five minutes.

348
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:28,169
No way. -Look, l'm winning
after four months.

349
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:31,401
l'll pay you back with
double interest.

350
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:34,836
Forget interest. Don't
mess with JC.

351
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,301
You do know who he is, right?

352
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:37,934
A Rahul.. there is always
another option -you can fold!

353
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,304
..there is always another
option -you can fold!

354
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,801
Learn to limit your losses.

355
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:50,567
Okay, fine.

356
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,535
My car's outside. It's yours!

357
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,735
That piece of shit?

358
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,735
Shit? You don't how much mileage
it gives. It's vintage.

359
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:07,701
Five minutes. Please!

360
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:14,134
Show!

361
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,571
God, if l win,l'll give
you 100/o of my winnings.

362
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:24,068
Okay, make it 150/o.

363
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,304
Fine, let's make a deal. 250/o.

364
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:38,101
Thank you.

365
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,101
You got lucky today.

366
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:51,436
l'll get you one day. 1000/o.

367
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,768
See, l have a theory on luck

368
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:56,435
One large whiskey.

369
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,367
Cheers.

370
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:22,802
Sir, are you from Bombay?

371
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:25,068
Yes.

372
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:28,068
You must be into films then.

373
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:30,735
Why? -Sir, you are from
Bombay, that's why.

374
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,469
ls everyone from Delhi
a politician?

375
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:38,102
l meant you have a good
body and style

376
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,402
Hey, l iust saw this circle
ten minutes ago.

377
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,634
Are you taking us for a ride?

378
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,004
You must be kidding, sir. Delhi
has a lot of traffic circles.

379
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:50,468
lt's not like Bombay, with
its narrow lanes.

380
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:54,403
And let me tell you, l
am not like others..

381
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:57,735
l will be your driver as long
as you are in Delhi.

382
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,067
Hello Sir, how are you?

383
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,535
You've come here too now? Scoot!

384
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,002
You want a VCD? l have all kinds
of films, Hollywood, Bollywood.

385
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:40,468
Blue films too. Single, double,
triple, what do you prefer?

386
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,035
Should l go to office or
watch your blue film?

387
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:45,534
lt's not MY blue film
sir, it's foreign.

388
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,635
Get lost! Sir please,
buy something.

389
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,469
Why don't you buy
a new briefcase?

390
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:55,603
Yours is way past its prime.

391
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,068
Why should l risk buying
anything from..

392
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,435
..1you when there are
good shops out there?

393
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,268
Sir, this is nothing for you.

394
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,967
You take such big risks
in gambling.

395
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:08,902
Who told you about gambling?
Stay away from my office peons!

396
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:11,201
Okay, fine, but please
buy something..

397
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,202
..at least. l have a lot
of things to sell.

398
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:17,602
The day l buy something from
you, l swear l'll quit gambling.

399
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,469
Okay, if not for
you, why don't..

400
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:22,534
..you buy a gift--maybe
for your wife?

401
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:28,535
Oh crap, It's Janhavi's
birthday. Go away!

402
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:32,435
How much? -15. -Cheat!

403
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:34,601
l don't have change.

404
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:38,101
Crap, l forgot Jahnavi's
birthday!

405
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,167
She'll never come back home now.

406
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,568
Come on, let's go! -Why?

407
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,668
Look around. A cup
of tea here will

408
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,434
..cost as much as a
whole meal outside.

409
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,535
Why don't you, for once..

410
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,669
think as big as your size? -Do
you have money to think big?

411
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,234
Do you have money to think
big? -Of course!

412
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,902
'l have the AGM power.
Now you go get it# 

413
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:04,902
Are you crazy? His credit card
was only for flight tickets.

414
00:29:04,966 --> 00:29:07,134
Don't mess with him,
he's a lunatic.

415
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,168
Let's iust go. l'm
not comfortable..

416
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:10,567
..with this whole
5-star culture.

417
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,135
Why can't l get the suite?

418
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,968
Sir, it's not in the system.

419
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,401
Do you know who my Uncle is?

420
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:34,501
He can buy this hotel
if he wants.

421
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:36,267
But l checked the system..

422
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,034
lf you don't value life,
it's your call.

423
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:40,268
But l have a lot of life
to live. Let's go!

424
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,936
ls that the way you treat
your customers?

425
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,835
l was booked for the
penthouse suite.

426
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,935
And you're giving me the regular
room! Where's the manager?

427
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,569
Sir, l am the floor manager.

428
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,568
Neha, go on, take a break.

429
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:54,967
What's the problem, Sir?

430
00:29:55,033 --> 00:29:56,501
You are the problem.

431
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:58,234
When you don't know how
to run a business,

432
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:00,035
why don't you iust shut it down?

433
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,401
Sir, please mind your language.

434
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,035
You mind your language.
You know who l am?

435
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:07,568
Are you done? l need
to check in.

436
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,235
l could buy your hotel
just like that.

437
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,801
Where is the owner?

438
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:15,168
Please calm down; l can check
the system again if you'd like.

439
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,035
What system, you bloody bitc..

440
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:21,534
Take him outside -gently.

441
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,935
What happened? -Nothing really,
just a small accident.

442
00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:28,268
He'll be fine. Can l get
a room? -Of course.

443
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:31,334
l'll iust check.

444
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:34,402
l'm sorry, you iust lost an..

445
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,335
..important customer
because of me.

446
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,568
Don't worry about it.

447
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:43,901
ls he okay?

448
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:45,801
Should be. Zaramud is with him.

449
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,169
Ma'am should l Neha, you take
a break. -l'll handle this.

450
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,935
She's Neha and you are Pooia?

451
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:58,467
How do you know?

452
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,435
Wild guess. l mean,
your name tag..

453
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,736
Mr Atmaram Gyanshekhar Machve?

454
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,801
Friends call me Sachin.

455
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:19,235
Jahnavi, are you home?

456
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:23,437
Jahnavi, are you home?

457
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,735
Mom, go on in.

458
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:51,901
Wait, let me in.

459
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,436
Go away, why did you come here?

460
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,235
Just five minutes Jahn. l'll
Ieave after that. Please.

461
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:09,668
Why do you keep coming here?

462
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:11,167
l told you, l don't want
to talk to you.

463
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,902
l've come to surprise
you on your birthday.

464
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,800
You remembered my birthday NOW?

465
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:18,235
l went to buy a gift
for you and..

466
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:21,467
..l got delayed. Happy Birthday.

467
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,269
What is it? -Go on, open it.

468
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:40,135
Your first mobile phone! And
the tiniest in the market.

469
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,303
This one doesn't even
have an antenna.

470
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,335
And there are games, like Snake.

471
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,135
And more important,

472
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:52,169
l've set a special
ring tone for you.

473
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:04,002
Oh this one's for me.

474
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,401
Same phone..

475
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:09,834
..from Matrix, Hello
Mr. Anderson.

476
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,601
lt's more like you went
to get yourself a..

477
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:13,234
..new phone, and you picked
one for me too.

478
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:17,136
No, no, it's the
other way round.

479
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:19,734
l went to get one for you

480
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,668
Alright, if you want,
you can take this.

481
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,169
See the problem is, this phone
has a lot of features.

482
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,003
lt's got Snake Il and your
phone has Snake l.

483
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:33,202
l thought maybe you can master..

484
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,335
..Snake l and then graduate
to Snake Il.

485
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,702
No, l don't want it..

486
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:43,102
..ln fact keep this as well.

487
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,600
Please..please.

488
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:52,368
This must have cost a lot.

489
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:54,767
Well, it's not your
birthday everyday.

490
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,268
Where did you get the
money for this?

491
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:00,834
Rahul, have you started again?

492
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,269
When l said l quit, l meant it.

493
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:05,634
l swear.

494
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,536
ls that the truth? -God promise.

495
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:16,069
Let's go home. -No way! -Okay..

496
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,768
..can l sleep here tonight?

497
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:23,835
No!

498
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:33,236
Jahn..

499
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,602
What is it?

500
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:38,134
Can l come in and sleep?
l'll be very quiet.

501
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:40,734
l'll sleep in one corner
of the bed.

502
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,234
You won't even know l am there.

503
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:46,834
l'll be very quiet.

504
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,735
Jahn, please!

505
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,802
Shut up and sleep.
Mom will wake up.

506
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,636
No respect for a
man around here.

507
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:27,935
Hi Neha. Is Pooia around?

508
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,834
Now this is cool.

509
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:54,868
Ring a bell and here
comes a pretty girl.

510
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:55,900
And a beautiful lady is here.

511
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:59,401
lf only life were so simple!

512
00:35:59,466 --> 00:36:01,401
Ring a bell and
your wish comes true!

513
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:05,102
l'd ring my own and..

514
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:07,701
..make a wish.

515
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,634
Point.

516
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,734
l'm staying up because
l'm on the night shift.

517
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,168
What's your excuse?

518
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,735
My 'excuse' is spread
all over my bed!

519
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,535
Want to go for a ride?
Maybe a coffee?

520
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,400
At this time.

521
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:27,535
FYl, this is Delhi, not Bombay.
Nights are nights here.

522
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,869
Anyway, l can't leave the hotel.

523
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:34,802
Who's asking you to
Ieave the hotel?

524
00:36:46,766 --> 00:36:48,901
So this is your idea of a ride?

525
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,869
What are you talking about?
It's beautiful, isn't it?

526
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:54,935
Sure, l know.

527
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:58,435
So this is how you spin
all the girls, huh?

528
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,669
Well, not all, only
the special ones.

529
00:37:03,466 --> 00:37:06,669
So how many special ones so far?

530
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:09,902
Around 38O

531
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:13,935
Just kidding. None so far

532
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:20,003
Why not? -Because l have
to make a century first.

533
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:22,633
What century?

534
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,135
This is terrible coffee! Your

535
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:29,334
hotel's a five-star
just on paper.

536
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,102
What's wrong with the
coffee? It's fine.

537
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:34,634
People have forgotten how good..

538
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:36,634
..coffee tastes -drinking
crap like this.

539
00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:38,367
ln my coffee-shop..

540
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:41,736
..people will rediscover coffee.

541
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,034
Coffee-shop? Like a tea stall?

542
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,869
No, a coffee parlor. A
cool hang out spot.

543
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:49,735
Tea stall?! Tell me this
do you know any.

544
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,502
place in Delhi that
serves good coffee?

545
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:55,035
Why iust Delhi, any city
for that matter? None.

546
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:57,668
That's what my coffee-shop
is about.

547
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,468
You'll get every kind
of coffee there is.

548
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:01,968
People will totally dig it.
There's good money in it too.

549
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:06,336
l think it's a really good idea.

550
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,402
lt is. l've always wanted to
do something on my own, too.

551
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:13,635
Really? l thought you were
happy with your job.

552
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,902
No way. Who wants to work
for someone else?

553
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:18,867
l'd rather work for myself.

554
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:21,967
Point.

555
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:46,836
Jai Hind. Welcome, Mr Rahul

556
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,802
Kuber! How are you?

557
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:52,568
l'm fine. -l was iust
thinking about you.

558
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:54,401
About returning your money.

559
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:58,970
l like it! You got the money
ready? -Yes, of course.

560
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:02,334
What a gentleman!

561
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,802
l'll write you a cheque.
Got a pen on you?

562
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:10,568
you'll write me a cheque?

563
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,667
What do you think l am, a
bank? And he is an ATM?

564
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,669
Dimple, take him. -Please! Wait.

565
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,601
Kuber, give me a week.

566
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:24,401
l promise l'll pay you back.
100 percent. -Dimple!

567
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,267
Wait, wait.

568
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:29,834
Keep my car till then.

569
00:39:30,466 --> 00:39:31,834
This piece of shit?

570
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,368
What are you saying? It
gives great mileage!

571
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:35,201
l'll have to tow it with a rope.

572
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:37,000
Checking!

573
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:42,401
Kuber, what are you doing?

574
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:45,602
What is this? Mobile?

575
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:47,834
You didn't buy this with
a cheque, did you?

576
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:50,368
You have money to buy
this, but not for me?

577
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:54,235
Dimple. Isn't this
a great phone?

578
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,567
lt's the same model they
used in The Matrix.

579
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:57,468
Hello, Mr Anderson.

580
00:39:57,533 --> 00:40:00,402
Oh, Hollywood, no less!
What else does it have?

581
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:03,568
lt's got memory, ring tones, WAP

582
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:07,935
WAP?Actually, l don't
know what that is.

583
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,536
Some new technology. It's
got Snake Il as well.

584
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,468
Snake? It's a game. -lt's
got games? Wow!

585
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,468
Well, this is mine now.

586
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:22,270
Please, this phone was for
my wife's birthday.

587
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:26,302
Look, if l don't get 7 lakhs in
7 days, God help you only.

588
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,868
Oh God!

589
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,835
Shera!

590
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,469
Dimple, what do you think
the snake will do?

591
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:16,434
Fine, you do the talking.

592
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,169
ls Rahul in? -Yes?

593
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:23,768
Hi, l'm Sachin, this is
my friend Zaramud.

594
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,434
We've come from Mumbai.

595
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,302
What do you want?
Can we come in?

596
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:31,436
Sorry, not interested.

597
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,668
What, he thought we're salesmen?

598
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:34,700
You want polite, eh?
Bull. Scare him.

599
00:41:34,766 --> 00:41:36,734
Think you know more
than me, huh?

600
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,135
You think l'm doing this for the
first time? -Fine, you do it.

601
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,670
Let me deal with him. -l told
you l'm not interested.

602
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,301
Not interested? Who's asking?

603
00:41:44,366 --> 00:41:46,401
See! This is how it's done!

604
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,835
You get it now? Where's
the money?

605
00:41:57,466 --> 00:41:59,267
l don't have any money.

606
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,501
What the hell!

607
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,235
But l have a solution.

608
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:06,734
First..

609
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:10,334
..can l have a glass of water?

610
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,202
What? Are we guests or are you?

611
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,268
Zara, get him some water.

612
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,667
Why is it always me?
-Get it, will you.

613
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:20,668
You're always ordering
me around!

614
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:24,501
Now where is the kitchen.
And where will l find a glass?

615
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:26,234
Thank you.

616
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:32,401
Here's your water.

617
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:34,234
You're being too easy on him.

618
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,335
Are you done?

619
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,134
Can we talk now?

620
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:52,635
Please give me a week's time.

621
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:55,335
l'll repay you the full amount.
We don't have a week's time.

622
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,468
Okay, Friday? No, can't
wait till Friday.

623
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,568
Saturday? Are you frigging
bargaining with us?

624
00:42:59,633 --> 00:43:02,402
He is acting too smart! -Friday?

625
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,234
l'll pay up by Friday, 1000/o.

626
00:43:05,766 --> 00:43:09,169
You don't have money now, how
will you get it by Friday?

627
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:11,301
He'll steal somewere.

628
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:13,634
l have a plan. -What plan?

629
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:17,135
Who do you think you are,
playing suspense games with us?

630
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,069
Speak up or l'll beat
the crap out of you.

631
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:22,201
Let me handle this.

632
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,802
There's a game on Friday.

633
00:43:26,533 --> 00:43:29,269
l'll place a bet on it..

634
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,303
..win and pay you back.

635
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:39,001
What a great plan!
-What if you lose?

636
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,036
lt's not possible. l have
it all figured out.

637
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,269
l've calculated everything.
l'm confident.

638
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,168
So you left your confidence in..

639
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:50,001
..Delhi when you came
to bet in Bombay?

640
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:53,769
Sometimes shit happens. But
this time, l'm sure.

641
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:57,336
So, Mr. Psychic, you know
everything, huh?

642
00:43:57,466 --> 00:44:00,168
Fine, tell me what's going to
happen next, in the match.

643
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:03,934
You want me to predict
right now?

644
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:05,934
Right now! -Yes. Let's see.

645
00:44:23,966 --> 00:44:26,535
Saurav Ganguly.. is
playing his shots..

646
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,167
We can see that too.

647
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,101
My calculation says..

648
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:33,435
..he'll try to go
for a big shot.

649
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:37,403
And he is most likely to
get caught and get out.

650
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,434
Out? Really?

651
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,568
Not a four, not a dot ball.

652
00:44:41,633 --> 00:44:43,401
But straight out! Let's see.

653
00:44:57,233 --> 00:45:00,269
So, Friday?

654
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:05,869
Fine. You have till Friday.
No more excuses later.

655
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:08,101
But see, the match
is on Friday..

656
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:10,601
..so would Saturday
be all right?

657
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,401
Now shut up. Friday.

658
00:45:12,466 --> 00:45:15,235
Friday late night, maybe?

659
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:21,901
Nice iacket. Whose is it?

660
00:45:21,966 --> 00:45:23,500
My wife's.

661
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:26,635
lt fits well. It's bloody
cold in Delhi.

662
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,901
Can l borrow it? -Sure.

663
00:45:29,566 --> 00:45:31,267
l'll return it on Friday.

664
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:33,401
And keep the money ready.

665
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,135
You have anything in
my size? -Let's go.

666
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,069
Okay, iust listen to me.

667
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,804
l'm sorry l overreacted

Thanks for the gift.
It's very cute.

669
00:46:22,433 --> 00:46:25,169
You don't have to get me gifts.

670
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,803
l iust want you to be truthful.

671
00:46:33,133 --> 00:46:36,402
What? Unbelievable,
you are quiet!

672
00:46:36,566 --> 00:46:39,168
You, of all people!

674
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,134
Bye.

675
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,134
She cut.

676
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:56,301
She again?

677
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,201
Hello, who's this?

678
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:01,067
Mr Bhuval Ram Kuber this side.

679
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:02,968
Talk to me. -Who?

680
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:06,369
Mr Bhuval Ram Kuber,
import-export business king!

681
00:47:08,066 --> 00:47:09,801
Where's Rahul?

682
00:47:09,866 --> 00:47:12,034
Rahul's not my wife. He doesn't
tell me his whereabouts.

683
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:16,401
This is Rahul's phone!

684
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,235
lt was. It's mine now.

685
00:47:20,733 --> 00:47:22,801
Are you a thief?

686
00:47:23,766 --> 00:47:28,270
What?! Rahul took my money
and you call me a thief?

687
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:32,235
What nonsense! That's
not possible.

688
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,002
What, you don't believe?
It is truth.

689
00:47:35,366 --> 00:47:38,335
Fine tell me, how much does
he owe you? l'll pay you.

690
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:43,936
Now you are talking business.
Seven lakhs only.

691
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:46,801
Seven lakhs!?

692
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:49,501
That's iust what he owes me.

693
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,068
There are many others.

694
00:47:52,133 --> 00:47:53,901
ls Rahul around?

695
00:47:54,066 --> 00:47:57,803
At the moment, no. But l'll
tell him you called.

696
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,435
By the way, who are
you? -Nobody.

697
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,468
Again she cut.

698
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,368
Hello.

699
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:15,334
Hello Kuber, did anyone call?

700
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:17,768
What am l, your secretary?

701
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:21,869
Kuber, please, if anyone calls..

702
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:24,135
..don't answer.

703
00:48:27,033 --> 00:48:28,901
Now he cut.

704
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:33,367
Hello.

705
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:35,300
l told you not to answer calls.

706
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,035
But it is you on the phone.

707
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:40,302
How do you know that?
-From your voice.

708
00:48:41,033 --> 00:48:45,237
The voice comes later.Come
on, please.

709
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,671
From now on, do not
answer. Please.

710
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:52,234
Well, l already answered one.

711
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,335
What? Who?

712
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,236
l don't know. l asked, but she..

713
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,135
..wouldn't say. She
was quite angry.

714
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:00,901
She?! -Yes, female.

715
00:49:00,966 --> 00:49:04,836
The name on the screen said
something.. like January..

716
00:49:04,966 --> 00:49:08,002
Jahnavi! Kuber! Goddamn you!

717
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:12,668
Talk with respect!
-Sorry, Kuber.

718
00:49:16,966 --> 00:49:18,667
He cut again.

719
00:49:24,733 --> 00:49:27,135
,
You lied to me! -No, Jahnavi
l did not lie.

720
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:29,334
Listen, l really don't
want to talk to you.

721
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,734
Jahnavi, please listen to me.

722
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,134
l can explain everything.

723
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,968
No need. l'm tired of
your explanations.

724
00:49:35,366 --> 00:49:39,737
You were getting me gifts!
Is this your gift..

725
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,668
..your lies?

726
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:44,102
Wait! Jahnavi, this
is from way before

727
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:48,603
l trusted you. l apologized.
l even felt guilty.

728
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:51,134
Thank God, that moron
picked up the phone.

729
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:53,101
Don't ever call me again.

730
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:56,068
Come on, cut the drama now!

731
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:07,868
So when is he paying us?

732
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:14,069
Friday, right?

733
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,235
How long till Friday?

734
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,268
What do we do till Friday?

735
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,168
Hi Pooia, l'm ready.

736
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:29,837
You are looking ready.
Where are you going?

737
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:32,335
How would l know, you
are taking me. -What?

738
00:54:15,733 --> 00:54:17,668
Give me a cigar.

739
00:54:23,933 --> 00:54:26,001
Aren't you playing today?

740
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:30,569
Not really. l am not getting
good signs from 'above# 

741
00:54:33,066 --> 00:54:35,001
Didn't you go back to London?

742
00:54:35,466 --> 00:54:37,568
No.

743
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,635
Where there is cricket,
there l am.

744
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,568
That's the real game.

745
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,901
Are you betting anything
on the next match?

746
00:54:46,966 --> 00:54:49,068
l'm thinking about it.

747
00:54:52,966 --> 00:54:55,068
You got any tips?

748
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:59,969
Ha! Tips are for waiters
not for punters.

749
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:02,435
l am playing like crap today.

750
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,601
Let me go and lose some more.

751
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,434
Who are you playing against?

752
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,837
There's this new guy, Dev. He's
on a hot streak. You know him?

753
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:14,904
Oh, The Drummer Boy. New
kid on the block.

754
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:17,601
Keep an eye on his fingers.

755
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:21,669
..When he is bluffing,
he drums faster.

756
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,438
Really? If that's true,
it'll really help me.

757
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,601
ls this how you figure
people out?

758
00:55:33,266 --> 00:55:35,468
Every player has
a telltale sign.

759
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:38,602
There is no one who does
not give away something.

760
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:42,902
So that's how you beat
me last time.

761
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,403
What's my tell? That's not
fair. If l tell you..

762
00:55:49,466 --> 00:55:52,368
..how will l win next time?

763
00:56:35,966 --> 00:56:38,868
Hello, Shuvo Jonmodin speaking.

764
00:56:40,566 --> 00:56:42,634
Hold on please.

765
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,735
Okay, Mr Rahul, l'll leave now.

766
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,868
Please do it as soon as possible
-in 1 or 2 days.

767
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:52,235
Sure, 2 to 4 days.

768
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,403
Please talk fast. Incoming calls
are also charged, you know.

769
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,668
Good morning Mr Vidyarthi.

770
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,668
What are you doing here?
Nice office, man.

771
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:56,235
Hey, why don't you swipe some..

772
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,368
..foreign money from
your office?

773
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:00,234
Have you lost it?

774
00:58:01,266 --> 00:58:03,568
Anyway, do you have the cash?

775
00:58:03,866 --> 00:58:06,401
Today? Today isn't Friday.

776
00:58:06,466 --> 00:58:08,501
lt will be. Very soon.

777
00:58:08,566 --> 00:58:11,368
We are so tired of hanging
around in Delhi..

778
00:58:11,433 --> 00:58:13,168
so we came to give
you some grief.

779
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:15,835
But if you don't have
the cash by Friday,

780
00:58:16,533 --> 00:58:18,568
AGM is not going to
go easy on you.

781
00:58:18,633 --> 00:58:20,801
What are we gonna do till
Friday? -Good question.

782
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,235
Like some tea?

783
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:26,868
Tea? Why not coffee?

784
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,701
Okay, let's go.

785
00:58:29,766 --> 00:58:31,767
Shut the hell up. We are not
here for tea and coffee.

786
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,834
That's your problem. If l am
nice, you take advantage.

787
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,402
Sir, did Jonmodin sir leave?
-Come after lunch.

788
00:58:36,466 --> 00:58:38,634
Come later.

789
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:40,534
Sir, the dollars need
to be converted.

790
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:43,201
l said come after
Iunch. -Yes sir.

791
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:49,334
Friday. l need money by Friday.

792
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,137
Please don't come here again.

793
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:55,335
Let's go.

794
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:03,468
lt was no fun at all. We
should've roughed him up a bit.

795
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:05,167
We didn't look like
gangsters. We..

796
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:06,701
..looked like we were asking
for a donation.

797
00:59:06,766 --> 00:59:08,567
Wait.

798
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,034
What?

799
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,401
Dollar convert. -Come later.

800
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:19,234
Let's go back!

801
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,702
You can't fool me every time.
Give me the money.

802
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:31,268
What money? -Come later.

803
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:32,801
Briefcase? Files and
office stuff.

804
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:34,634
Please don't create a scene
here. l'll lose my job.

805
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:36,401
Open it! Show me what's inside.

806
00:59:36,466 --> 00:59:38,734
Okay, l'll show you. There
is nothing. See.

807
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,202
Nothing, huh? Zara, check it.

808
00:59:41,366 --> 00:59:44,068
hy are you worried if there
is nothing inside?

809
00:59:49,133 --> 00:59:50,334
There is nothing.

810
00:59:53,066 --> 00:59:54,667
This is my office, please!

811
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:58,234
Look properly.

812
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:00,667
What do we have here?

813
01:00:04,366 --> 01:00:05,734
Smartass!

814
01:00:06,566 --> 01:00:08,200
That is not my money.

815
01:00:08,266 --> 01:00:10,034
Then we don't have
a problem at all.

816
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:12,135
Please, this belongs to
one of my customers.

817
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:14,435
lf he doesn't get it
back, l am screwed.

818
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,336
Rahul Vidyarthi, you
owe AGM money..

819
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,268
that's my headache,
you owe your..

820
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,068
..customer money, that's
your headache.

821
01:00:21,133 --> 01:00:23,168
We con the world and you
are trying to con us?

822
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:26,002
Listen, l have a plan.

823
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:29,436
l'll triple this money.
Guaranteed.

824
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:34,435
Three times or five, you are
not getting this back.

825
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:37,301
But, l'll be so screwed.

826
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,369
Pal, you were screwed the
day you bet with AGM.

827
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:43,068
Let's go. My iacket..

828
01:00:43,133 --> 01:00:45,435
Zaramud, please, please..

829
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,202
Sounds good! Let's meet
up for tea then.

830
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,268
Move it. Let's get out of here.

831
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:07,468
Don't worry. We'll
be out in a flash.

832
01:01:21,266 --> 01:01:23,334
How much longer to the airport?

833
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:26,701
Why are you going through crappy
roads? Take the highway.

834
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:30,136
There is heavy work
on the highways.

835
01:01:30,366 --> 01:01:33,102
That guy is visiting
right.. Bill Kilton.

836
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:35,301
The whole of Delhi is
being swept clean.

837
01:01:35,366 --> 01:01:37,668
They can swept the whole world.

838
01:01:38,033 --> 01:01:40,068
Don't worry, this
is a short cut.

839
01:01:40,266 --> 01:01:42,968
Now what the hell is this?

840
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,302
Who left these carts
on the road?

841
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,168
l should've said bye
to Pooja properly.

842
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:52,202
Why iust bye? Why not
'l love you' too?

843
01:01:52,266 --> 01:01:54,201
What are you talking about?

844
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,201
You are definitely in love, son!

845
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:01,668
lt's not like that.
She was nice to us.

846
01:02:01,933 --> 01:02:04,168
And she helped us lot.

847
01:02:04,233 --> 01:02:07,369
Us? Just you! You are the hero!

848
01:02:08,233 --> 01:02:09,634
Oh, you are blushing now?

849
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,635
So sweet, you are turning pink.

850
01:02:14,866 --> 01:02:17,068
Should we start a
song and dance?

851
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,667
A romantic number?

852
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,501
l meet you in my dreams
every night..

853
01:02:22,566 --> 01:02:24,534
That's not good. How about..

854
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:26,401
Zara, look, looks iust
like our bag.

855
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:37,168
Shit, it is our bag!

856
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:35,134
AGM will break our bones.

857
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:40,968
He'll break our bones
and crush them.

858
01:03:45,066 --> 01:03:46,300
l have an idea. -Won't work.

859
01:03:47,566 --> 01:03:50,035
At least hear me out. What if we

860
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,834
Not happening.

861
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:54,334
Okay, how about we

862
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,034
Do you want to die?

863
01:03:58,033 --> 01:04:00,135
What if we go to. -Won't work.

864
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:02,867
There's no way out.

865
01:04:07,933 --> 01:04:09,334
Except one.

866
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:16,534
l can't believe it!

867
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,868
l iust can't believe it!

868
01:04:23,933 --> 01:04:26,035
We can't help it if everyone
in Delhi is a crook.

869
01:04:26,433 --> 01:04:27,967
ls everyone from
Bombay an idiot?

870
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:30,068
You think you can steal some
more from your office?

871
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,533
You think your dad
owns this place?

872
01:04:31,766 --> 01:04:34,168
Enough. Let's discuss
this outside.

873
01:04:34,233 --> 01:04:35,801
There's nothing left to discuss.

874
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:38,768
l know, but you said
something about..

875
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,735
..tripling money. What
was that about?

876
01:04:42,133 --> 01:04:44,235
Even that needs money.

877
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,801
What's three times zero?

878
01:04:46,866 --> 01:04:48,100
lt's still zero!

879
01:04:48,466 --> 01:04:52,102
Okay, relax now. l'll do
something about the money.

880
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:54,067
What was that idea? You
were talking about?

881
01:05:04,366 --> 01:05:05,700
What?

882
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:08,100
Your plan?

883
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,101
Right! My plan.

884
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:17,403
We'll bet on the next
cricket match..

885
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,801
..and we will win.

886
01:05:20,033 --> 01:05:22,335
Well not exactly but yeah,
something like that.

887
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:24,868
lf l had the money now..

888
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,736
..l'd have tripled
it. Guaranteed!

889
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,768
So you know who is going
to win the match?

890
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:35,067
No!

891
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,400
Oh man, we're SO screwed!

892
01:05:38,033 --> 01:05:41,836
But l know who knows who
will win the match.

893
01:05:42,033 --> 01:05:43,367
Who?

894
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:46,767
JC! Who the hell is JC?

895
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:50,102
He's a rich businessman.
And a big gambler too.

896
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:53,035
He is the guy when it comes
to cricket betting.

897
01:05:54,133 --> 01:05:56,602
And l hear he fixes matches.

898
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:00,868
He bets millions.

899
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:03,135
You think he'll wait
for the result?

900
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,601
So?

901
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:09,402
So? He's from London but is..

902
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:11,800
..here in Delhi for this
cricket series.

903
01:06:11,866 --> 01:06:13,367
And he is staying in the
same hotel as you.

904
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:14,700
So?

905
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,771
So, we bet on the same
team that he does.

906
01:06:23,633 --> 01:06:24,633
And?

907
01:06:24,933 --> 01:06:26,634
And?

908
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,735
And what? That's your plan?

909
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,401
Yup!

910
01:06:33,966 --> 01:06:35,400
Excuse me.

911
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:38,634
Where's the 'plan' in this plan?

912
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,035
But how do we know..

913
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:45,734
..who JC is betting on?

914
01:06:46,133 --> 01:06:48,268
You are the thugs. Go figure.

915
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,401
We're screwed!

916
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,334
Yeah man. We're SO screwed!

917
01:07:10,033 --> 01:07:12,802
Wake up.

918
01:07:15,733 --> 01:07:17,034
Zaramud, what the.. Get off me!

919
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:20,970
Listen, l have a plan.

920
01:07:22,133 --> 01:07:25,302
Hello, Rahul? Jonmodin here.

921
01:07:26,633 --> 01:07:28,134
Hello, Mr Jonmodin. How are you?

922
01:07:28,533 --> 01:07:31,068
l'm fine. My dollars..

923
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,669
..haven't been converted yet.

924
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,270
Really? Let me check
and get back to you.

925
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:40,268
Don't you worry. -Please.

926
01:07:40,566 --> 01:07:42,234
No problem, Mr Jonmodin.

927
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,634
You again?

928
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,068
Got the money?

929
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,769
No. But we have a plan.

930
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:54,768
For this plan to work..

931
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,734
..l have to do a
Iot of pleading.

932
01:07:56,933 --> 01:07:58,567
No! -Hear me out at
Ieast! -No way!

933
01:07:58,633 --> 01:08:01,769
Please Pooia, you're the only
one who can help me out.

934
01:08:01,933 --> 01:08:04,468
You should be ashamed!
You only just met me..

935
01:08:04,533 --> 01:08:05,800
..and you're asking
for a favour?

936
01:08:06,099 --> 01:08:08,969
Hey, l had only 'iust
met' you when..

937
01:08:09,033 --> 01:08:12,102
l helped you with that
nasty customer.

938
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:13,934
You owe me one!

939
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:16,968
That's cheap! You're asking
for a return favour?

940
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:19,034
No, not really.

941
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:21,000
Look, you don't know
me so well today.

942
01:08:21,066 --> 01:08:23,535
But one day, we'll
be very close..

943
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,034
..and then you'll
want to help me.

944
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,202
But l don't want your help then,
l want it now -in advance.

945
01:08:27,266 --> 01:08:30,168
Are you serious? l could get
into serious trouble here.

946
01:08:30,233 --> 01:08:31,801
Pooia, you could get into
trouble -future.

947
01:08:31,866 --> 01:08:33,634
l am already in trouble
-present.

948
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,236
lt will be fine, trust me!

949
01:08:37,566 --> 01:08:40,635
Trust you? Your name is
all l know about you

950
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:42,635
l don't even know what you do.

951
01:08:43,133 --> 01:08:45,268
What do you do, anyway?

952
01:08:48,133 --> 01:08:50,568
Err.. when people don't pay
up, l collect from them.

953
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,002
That's to say, l collect from
people when they don't pay up.

954
01:08:53,966 --> 01:08:55,100
You are a goon?

955
01:08:55,166 --> 01:08:56,800
Goon? Of course not!

956
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:02,104
Mine is more of an
administrative job.

957
01:09:02,933 --> 01:09:04,601
Get it?

958
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:07,935
Yes, l get it. l thought
you were a nice guy.

959
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,601
Why, thanks!

960
01:09:10,433 --> 01:09:13,569
But now l know you're a ierk!

961
01:09:15,033 --> 01:09:18,169
Jerk? Hello, what do
you mean by that?

962
01:09:18,566 --> 01:09:20,834
Step 2. We need to get
hold of JC's mobile.

963
01:09:21,733 --> 01:09:24,469
Just for a couple of minutes.

964
01:09:25,733 --> 01:09:27,201
Be careful, please.

965
01:09:27,433 --> 01:09:29,468
Don't beat him up and stuff.

966
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:30,533
l could lose my iob here.

967
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,502
Okay, l'm ready. -Huh?
You're going in?

968
01:09:33,566 --> 01:09:34,700
Yup.

969
01:09:34,766 --> 01:09:36,167
Zara, think about it. You
have a size limitation.

970
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:37,901
l'll be in and out in a flash.

971
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:39,934
You always get to be hero.
And l, your sidekick!

972
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,501
You are always Tendulkar.
And l, Dravid.

973
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,901
Today l'll be Tendulkar. You
watch from the sidelines.

974
01:09:42,966 --> 01:09:46,602
Side please! There is
going to be violence.

975
01:09:57,899 --> 01:09:59,101
What?

976
01:10:02,466 --> 01:10:04,401
All l get in my size are shoes!

977
01:10:08,866 --> 01:10:09,800
There, it fits.

978
01:10:14,033 --> 01:10:16,668
So Dravid-ii, back
to the pavilion?

979
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:19,468
Now may l? -Yeah, yeah, you
only go. Be the hero.

980
01:10:21,866 --> 01:10:23,067
He iust turned on the shower!

981
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:36,201
Here, take this with you.
It will look realistic.

982
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:39,600
Why, did he order something?

983
01:13:11,899 --> 01:13:13,735
l knew it. l knew it
from the start.

984
01:13:14,566 --> 01:13:15,900
You're crazy!

985
01:13:20,566 --> 01:13:21,566
Ouch, that hurts!

986
01:13:21,633 --> 01:13:23,568
So what, you can take
it! You're the hero!

987
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,567
lt's not about being
a hero, Pooja.

988
01:13:26,933 --> 01:13:28,334
You have to take some risks.

989
01:13:28,466 --> 01:13:30,234
l should be thankful
l didn't get caught.

990
01:13:30,466 --> 01:13:32,301
Why am l even doing this?

991
01:13:32,466 --> 01:13:33,800
l don't even know you.

992
01:13:34,566 --> 01:13:35,767
l'm helping you for no reason.

993
01:13:36,533 --> 01:13:39,302
And you, you're using me.

994
01:13:39,466 --> 01:13:43,570
Using you? You think l would
take advantage of you?

995
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:48,203
l came to you for a favour
because l thought we

996
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:50,434
We what?

997
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,702
l thought we had a connection.

998
01:13:55,699 --> 01:13:57,368
You know, like
partners-in-crime.

999
01:13:57,899 --> 01:13:59,501
Partners-in-crime, huh?

1000
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:01,467
You can't offer
a better partnership?

1001
01:14:01,533 --> 01:14:02,600
What else can l offer?

1002
01:14:03,533 --> 01:14:05,501
Why should l do this
for charity?

1003
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:07,668
You have a dream and so do l.

1004
01:14:10,733 --> 01:14:12,201
l want partnership in
the coffee-shop.

1005
01:14:12,533 --> 01:14:14,468
Coffee-shop? Oh coffee-shop!

1006
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:16,634
So now..

1007
01:14:17,433 --> 01:14:19,268
..YOU'RE using me.

1008
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:21,635
Well, you used me too!

1009
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,567
l'll think about it.

1010
01:14:27,866 --> 01:14:29,534
But first, we have to get
our hands on the phone.

1011
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:34,569
Why don't you iust pick his
pocket or something?

1012
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:38,869
l mean, you guys generally..

1013
01:14:41,266 --> 01:14:43,167
..do this kind of stuff, right?

1014
01:14:43,699 --> 01:14:45,435
Shit!

1015
01:14:45,933 --> 01:14:49,836
We are screwed. Big master
planner, you are.

1016
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:52,869
Sometimes, you should listen
to me too you know..

1017
01:14:52,933 --> 01:14:54,834
The usual. Large.

1018
01:14:57,633 --> 01:14:59,768
Where's the men's room?

1019
01:15:00,566 --> 01:15:03,535
lt is right there, sir.

1020
01:15:14,066 --> 01:15:16,401
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1021
01:15:16,466 --> 01:15:17,767
Open it. Quick! What
else can l offer?

1022
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:19,668
You'll get us caught! Quick!

1023
01:15:19,733 --> 01:15:22,168
Write down this number.
Quick, give me a pen.

1024
01:15:22,233 --> 01:15:23,701
l don't have a pen.

1025
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:26,201
Shit! Okay, memorize it.

1026
01:15:26,266 --> 01:15:28,434
Lets remember a few
numbers each.

1027
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,435
Memorize it!

1028
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,235
He's coming.

1029
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,435
Wait, don't panic.

1030
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,735
Sachin, give me the phone.

1031
01:16:14,766 --> 01:16:18,302
Every mobile SIM has a unique
number. The IMSl number.

1032
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:21,268
lf we get it, l can
clone a card.

1033
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:23,735
With that, we can tap into
his conversations.

1034
01:16:24,633 --> 01:16:27,168
Man, you guys are pretty
technical thieves!

1035
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:30,002
You don't use a mobile, but
you know all about it.

1036
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,368
The thing is, mobiles
are harmful.

1037
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,168
You put it here, your
brain is screwed.

1038
01:16:34,233 --> 01:16:36,034
You put it here, your
heart is screwed.

1039
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:38,635
And if you put it here.. -

1040
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,368
Zaramud's technology is pretty
amazing actually!

1041
01:16:41,433 --> 01:16:44,035
Connect the phone with the
cloned SIM to a recorder..

1042
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:46,635
..and if JC so much as breathes
on the phone, it'll be recorded.

1043
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,702
Okay, fine, the plan is set, but
there's still the main issue.

1044
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,535
Where's the money? Nobody in
Delhi will lend me money.

1045
01:16:53,766 --> 01:16:55,367
Tell me something
new, Rahul uncle.

1046
01:16:55,566 --> 01:16:58,302
How much do we owe? -l
owe AGM 20 lakhs.

1047
01:16:58,366 --> 01:17:00,534
Plus interest. -Another 2.
-And we owe him 50 lakhs.

1048
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:04,069
l took 20 from the office. And
have to give 7 to Kuber.

1049
01:17:04,133 --> 01:17:06,101
What's the total, Zara?

1050
01:17:06,366 --> 01:17:08,034
Total is.. l don't know.. a lot!

1051
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,068
That much even l know! -How much
do we need to place the bet?

1052
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:12,068
What bet? We have nothing!

1053
01:17:12,133 --> 01:17:13,567
l have a plan.

1054
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,235
Our Excel sheet! -Are you nuts?

1055
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:21,035
l don't want to make
it worse with AGM.

1056
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,634
Fine, l'll do it.

1057
01:17:22,699 --> 01:17:25,436
l won't say a word. l'll have
nothing to do with this.

1058
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:50,371
Bollywood has forgotten
its roots.

1059
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:54,669
ll these producers are making
films for rich expatriates.

1060
01:17:54,966 --> 01:17:57,034
The local audience has
been forgotten!

1061
01:17:57,666 --> 01:17:59,868
Who will reach them?
Think about it.

1062
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:02,101
Sir, you think Bhoipuri films

1063
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:04,334
will reach that audience?
-Of course they will.

1064
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:06,602
Mark my words, one day even..

1065
01:18:07,033 --> 01:18:09,502
Amitabh Bachchan will act
in a Bhojpuri film.

1066
01:18:21,266 --> 01:18:24,002
You didn't need to trouble
yourself and come here.

1067
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:26,368
l'd have come over
if you'd called.

1068
01:18:26,966 --> 01:18:29,501
You're the one giving
us trouble.

1069
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,435
You can't be serious.

1070
01:18:32,633 --> 01:18:36,303
We called you a hundred times
but you never answer.

1071
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:41,170
Oh! That Mumbai number is AGM's?

1072
01:18:41,899 --> 01:18:43,868
What did you think?

1073
01:18:43,933 --> 01:18:46,168
Oh, l am so sorry. l thought

1074
01:18:46,233 --> 01:18:48,468
You thought what? That if you
didn't answer, AGM will forget?

1075
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:50,901
That he won't come all the way
to Delhi to kick your ass?

1076
01:18:50,966 --> 01:18:53,201
And now, we are here!

1077
01:18:54,866 --> 01:18:58,169
Okay, l get it. Look, there's no
need to create a scene here.

1078
01:18:58,966 --> 01:19:01,301
l'll arrange for your money.

1079
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:04,502
But right now l am
very busy. Baby..

1080
01:19:07,266 --> 01:19:10,302
Cut the crap! Save the
acting for the camera

1081
01:19:10,366 --> 01:19:13,335
One punch and you'll never
be able to act again!

1082
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,369
Kewal-ii, can l get
your autograph?

1083
01:19:16,433 --> 01:19:18,401
l've seen a lot of your films.

1084
01:19:18,466 --> 01:19:20,267
Especially when you used
to act in Hindi films.

1085
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:24,336
Rakhee, go inside.
Put something on.

1086
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:27,236
You'll catch a cold. l'll
see you in a bit.

1087
01:19:33,266 --> 01:19:37,837
l'll need at least a month
to get the money.

1088
01:19:39,933 --> 01:19:43,836
You won't be alive for a
month if you don't pay.

1089
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,502
ls there a way out? Something
in between.

1090
01:19:48,566 --> 01:19:50,301
Hold on!

1091
01:19:50,366 --> 01:19:54,036
How much do we really need
to make AGM happy?

1092
01:20:02,266 --> 01:20:04,901
Fine. Here's the deal.

1093
01:20:05,366 --> 01:20:08,102
You pay half now and
the rest next month.

1094
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:10,101
l'll personally speak to
AGM on your behalf.

1095
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:12,568
Only because your problem
is genuine..

1096
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,335
..and my friend here
is your genuine fan.

1097
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,502
Kewal-ii, l'd like the
autograph now..

1098
01:20:18,566 --> 01:20:21,835
..because later you might
not be able to.

1099
01:20:21,966 --> 01:20:24,802
You'll get the autograph
and the money, both.

1100
01:20:24,866 --> 01:20:26,367
Sure? -Absolutely!

1101
01:20:26,433 --> 01:20:28,268
Kewal-ii, we are ready
for the shot..

1102
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:30,134
Well, l have to take your leave.

1103
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:32,101
But don't you worry, the
money will be ready.

1104
01:20:32,366 --> 01:20:34,267
Bye, big brother.

1105
01:20:39,266 --> 01:20:41,034
Learn something, Fatass.

1106
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,868
Couldn't you say a word?

1107
01:20:42,933 --> 01:20:44,501
Tendulkar found a new
partner in Ganguly..

1108
01:20:44,566 --> 01:20:46,301
now Dravid is not
needed anymore.

1109
01:20:49,366 --> 01:20:52,435
Rahul has started fancying
films now?

1110
01:20:57,366 --> 01:21:00,168
You're enioying this,
aren't you?

1111
01:21:00,533 --> 01:21:02,268
Move it!

1112
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,169
Where's the ketchup? -ln the
fridge. -There's nothing here.

1113
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,335
Hello.. tomato ketchup..

1114
01:22:11,533 --> 01:22:14,068
Have you counted this?
Have you? Hello..

1115
01:22:14,266 --> 01:22:18,236
Come on! Now l have to
start all over again.

1116
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,002
What if Kewal calls AGM?

1117
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,570
No he won't. Has Rahul called
AGM? By the way..

1118
01:22:25,633 --> 01:22:28,435
..how did you believe that
we are AGM's men?

1119
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,935
..We could have been lying.

1120
01:22:32,066 --> 01:22:34,168
Have to go to the bathroom..

1121
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:38,169
Are you really AGM's men?
Have a photo ID?

1122
01:22:43,366 --> 01:22:48,370
Expecting someone?
Quick, go check.

1123
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:55,501
Who is it?

1124
01:22:55,566 --> 01:22:58,902
Kuber! -Who the hell is Kuber?

1125
01:22:58,966 --> 01:23:01,301
The one who took my phone.

1126
01:23:01,366 --> 01:23:03,334
Don't know what he is going to
take today. Hide the money.

1127
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:05,468
ls there anyone you
don't owe money to?

1128
01:23:05,533 --> 01:23:07,935
Get rid of him quickly. And
don't say anything about us.

1129
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:16,468
Kuber! -At your service.

1130
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,068
Hi, Dimple. -Who is
this young man?

1131
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,335
You owe him money too?

1132
01:23:21,466 --> 01:23:23,568
My cousin from Bombay.

1133
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:27,401
You said you'll have
money by Friday,

1134
01:23:28,133 --> 01:23:31,469
l am sure you have something
big going on.

1135
01:23:31,533 --> 01:23:33,134
What big?

1136
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,936
What are you hiding? Spit truth!

1137
01:23:36,233 --> 01:23:38,335
What could l be hiding?
-Checking! -Go ahead.

1138
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:43,970
No James Bond phone this time?
-All l have is some loose change.

1139
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:47,035
What's behind your
cousin? -What?

1140
01:23:47,233 --> 01:23:50,135
Hiding cocaine? Spreading
the rot in Delhi?

1141
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:52,368
Okay, smartass, l've had enough.

1142
01:23:52,433 --> 01:23:53,934
Cut the crap.

1143
01:23:55,066 --> 01:23:57,268
Are you threatening me?

1144
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,268
Don't ever touch me.

1145
01:24:00,899 --> 01:24:03,602
Listen Mowgli, pack up your
Iuggage and get out.

1146
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,802
Oh! Dimple, he is calling
you luggage.

1147
01:24:29,266 --> 01:24:31,468
lf l see you back here
before Friday..

1148
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,769
..you'll never be seen
in Delhi again.

1149
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,835
How could you steal his
phone you cheap crook?

1150
01:24:40,133 --> 01:24:42,034
lt was a birthday gift
from his wife.

1151
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,501
l know that.

1152
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:45,801
Give it back.

1153
01:24:45,866 --> 01:24:47,801
lt's with Dimple.

1154
01:24:48,533 --> 01:24:50,534
Get it. -Wait.

1155
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,902
Can you also 'talk' to
him about my debt?

1156
01:25:00,033 --> 01:25:02,001
Okay, no problem. l am
getting my phone back.

1157
01:25:04,733 --> 01:25:06,267
Give it to him.

1158
01:25:11,033 --> 01:25:13,168
Let's iust forget whatever
happened. Okay?

1159
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:16,735
Beat it.

1160
01:25:18,366 --> 01:25:19,834
Jai Hind!

1161
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:23,368
That's why l say don't
use mobiles.

1162
01:25:23,733 --> 01:25:25,768
They are iust trouble.

1163
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:30,236
What happened? Fighting?
Over? Shit, man!

1164
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:51,702
What's he doing up there?

1165
01:25:51,933 --> 01:25:54,935
l thought this might
give more effect.

1166
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,968
And you are going to
crown him king?

1167
01:25:57,899 --> 01:26:00,202
What the hell are you staring
at? Bring him down.

1168
01:26:00,266 --> 01:26:02,001
Right away, bhai.

1169
01:26:02,066 --> 01:26:03,834
l am rearing monkeys here.

1170
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:06,202
lt's a good thing they didn't
put a crown on him.

1171
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:09,168
Go and help them.

1172
01:26:18,966 --> 01:26:20,734
lf you say Hello one more time,
l'll sock you through the phone.

1173
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,068
Oh, AGM-bhai! Jai Hind,
how are you?

1174
01:26:23,233 --> 01:26:25,268
You've called to inquire
about my health?

1175
01:26:25,966 --> 01:26:27,867
Damn it! l don't have
good signal here.

1176
01:26:28,066 --> 01:26:30,735
Hold on.. can you hear me?

1177
01:26:34,966 --> 01:26:37,435
Will you frigging say
what you want or not?

1178
01:26:37,966 --> 01:26:41,035
Bhai, have l ever called
you to ask for anything?

1179
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,968
l believe in giving.

1180
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:46,102
You know Kewal, the film star..

1181
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:48,635
1
What about him? -Well
you know Rahul..

1182
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,103
Rahul who? -The same guy l
sent to you for betting..

1183
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:55,770
What about him? -Well, he went
with his two cousins..

1184
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:57,901
..to Kewal's film set.

1185
01:26:58,066 --> 01:27:01,002
And l don't think it was for an
autograph. -Who are those two?

1186
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:03,701
l don't know they are
both from Mumbai.

1187
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:06,102
One of them is really fat..

1188
01:27:06,266 --> 01:27:08,201
Really what?

1189
01:27:08,633 --> 01:27:10,768
Hello.. fat.. fat..

1190
01:27:11,033 --> 01:27:15,737
Elephant.. hippo.. tanker..

1191
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:22,571
T E N K R.. Tanker

1192
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:28,602
What the..Frigging network..

1193
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:45,334
Hello. -Hello, this is AGM.

1194
01:27:45,566 --> 01:27:48,201
AGM-bhai, hope you
got the money.

1195
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,269
What money? -l sent
half of my debt.

1196
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:54,102
Half? You think l am a moron?

1197
01:27:55,666 --> 01:27:58,001
Please cut some slack, AGM-bhai.

1198
01:27:58,166 --> 01:28:00,101
l couldn't manage to get
all the money so soon.

1199
01:28:00,166 --> 01:28:02,034
You listen to me, you
two-bit actor.

1200
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:05,236
You come here and give me the
rest of my money, get it?

1201
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,902
AGM-bhai, l'm in the
middle of a shoot..

1202
01:28:07,966 --> 01:28:10,034
..right now. Sachin told me..

1203
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:12,502
Shut up! Either you come here or

1204
01:28:12,566 --> 01:28:14,901
l'm coming there
with a real gun.

1205
01:28:15,133 --> 01:28:19,871
l'll come over.. please
calm down.

1206
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,802
Call Sachin.

1207
01:28:31,533 --> 01:28:33,501
Sachin doesn't use a mobile.

1208
01:28:33,566 --> 01:28:35,301
He doesn't use a mobile?

1209
01:28:35,533 --> 01:28:36,834
No.. he says if you put
mobile over here,

1210
01:28:36,899 --> 01:28:38,668
you'll get brain cancer
over here or something.

1211
01:28:39,066 --> 01:28:40,667
Call the place where
he is staying.

1212
01:28:40,866 --> 01:28:42,734
They didn't go to
Chandu's place.

1213
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,735
They are probably staying
at some hotel.

1214
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,235
Yes, they have your
credit card too.

1215
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,569
Jahnavi

1216
01:28:54,566 --> 01:28:56,668
Jaan please open the door..

1217
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:00,169
lf you can only hear me out
you'll understand my situation.

1218
01:29:02,233 --> 01:29:04,535
Jahnavi, are you there?

1219
01:29:18,766 --> 01:29:21,735
Jahnavi, are you there?

1220
01:29:44,966 --> 01:29:46,667
Nothing at all?

1221
01:29:46,733 --> 01:29:50,103
Are you sure he is
into this match?

1222
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:53,802
He hasn't said anything
about the match.

1223
01:29:53,966 --> 01:29:56,001
He has to talk something.

1224
01:29:56,633 --> 01:29:59,235
And we have to bet tomorrow.
We don't much time.

1225
01:30:00,666 --> 01:30:03,068
Do you have any other idea?
-Hold on. Let me try one

1226
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:07,368
Hello, JC sir.. please come.

1227
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:14,868
l am not in the mood today,
call for my car.

1228
01:30:17,433 --> 01:30:20,702
Hey Rahul! How are you, JC sir?

1229
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,802
You are not playing
today either?

1230
01:30:24,366 --> 01:30:27,902
No signals from the heavens?

1231
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,435
Well, you don't seem to
be playing either.

1232
01:30:31,733 --> 01:30:34,769
l'm done for today. Plus l am..

1233
01:30:35,533 --> 01:30:37,968
..saving all my luck
for tomorrow.

1234
01:30:38,633 --> 01:30:41,769
Tomorrow? For the match.

1235
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,401
Oh yes..

1236
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,702
You are betting on the
match too, aren't you?

1237
01:30:49,433 --> 01:30:51,868
Maybe a little. Thinking
about it.

1238
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:54,635
A little? And you are
thinking about it?

1239
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:58,503
lf you want to win
big, think big.

1240
01:30:59,966 --> 01:31:02,668
Anyway, everyone has
his specialty.

1241
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,502
Like you are with cards,
l am with cricket.

1242
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,501
l know. l've heard
it on the news.

1243
01:31:08,566 --> 01:31:10,801
Not everything on
the news is true.

1244
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,735
l've heard that too.

1245
01:31:13,966 --> 01:31:16,501
But everything isn't
false either.

1246
01:31:16,966 --> 01:31:19,768
Okay, l'll see you later.

1247
01:31:24,633 --> 01:31:28,136
Listen, the other day your
tip helped me a lot.

1248
01:31:28,633 --> 01:31:30,368
Today, l'll give you one.

1249
01:31:31,366 --> 01:31:33,468
You'll be made!

1250
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:40,568
A deal's been struck with our

1251
01:31:40,699 --> 01:31:43,069
star batsmen. You understand?

1252
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:46,535
They are going to throw
away the match.

1253
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,868
Don't bet on India tomorrow..

1254
01:31:49,466 --> 01:31:51,734
..bet on the foreigners.

1255
01:32:06,766 --> 01:32:08,601
There you go.

1256
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:10,300
Have a drink.

1257
01:32:10,366 --> 01:32:11,667
l don't drink.

1258
01:32:11,733 --> 01:32:13,668
You are weird, man. All those
vices but this one virtue?

1259
01:32:13,733 --> 01:32:13,733
You gamble, you steal, you lie

1260
01:32:17,066 --> 01:32:20,702
to your wife but
you don't drink!

1261
01:32:20,766 --> 01:32:24,736
What great things have you
achieved by drinking, you buffalo?

1262
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:29,036
Watch it! Don't go there.
It's a sensitive matter.

1263
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:31,969
What have you achieved
in life anyway?

1264
01:32:32,033 --> 01:32:34,602
You keep talking crap about
making a century.

1265
01:32:34,666 --> 01:32:37,301
You both are good for nothing.

1266
01:32:37,366 --> 01:32:40,001
Hey, why are you dragging
me into this?

1267
01:32:40,066 --> 01:32:43,102
l didn't force the drink
down your throat.

1268
01:33:02,966 --> 01:33:04,667
What?

1269
01:33:04,733 --> 01:33:06,935
Jahn.. l'm really very sorry.

1270
01:33:07,233 --> 01:33:08,567
l know l should've told you..

1271
01:33:08,633 --> 01:33:10,701
..everything but l
didn't know how.

1272
01:33:11,266 --> 01:33:12,867
That's right, you always
have to calculate..

1273
01:33:12,933 --> 01:33:14,034
and make up stories
before you speak!

1274
01:33:14,266 --> 01:33:16,601
No.. never.. l never..

1275
01:33:18,033 --> 01:33:19,968
Wait a minute. What
do you mean..

1276
01:33:20,033 --> 01:33:21,834
l calculate and make up stories?

1277
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:24,302
Don't act smart. -See this
is what l don't get.

1278
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:26,635
First you say something strange

1279
01:33:26,699 --> 01:33:27,967
and then you expect me to
get inside your head

1280
01:33:28,033 --> 01:33:29,834
and understand what you
are trying to say.

1281
01:33:29,966 --> 01:33:31,967
Listen, iust cut it.
-Okay, fine, cut it.

1282
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:46,236
Rahul.. listen, l don't want to.

1283
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,234
l am sorry. It's my fault. Okay?

1284
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,468
We shouldn't fight like this.

1285
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:51,901
l think we should grow up.

1286
01:33:52,233 --> 01:33:54,001
You grow up, Rahul. -Okay,
okay. l will grow up.

1287
01:33:54,666 --> 01:33:57,301
You iust realized
your fault today?

1288
01:33:57,566 --> 01:33:58,867
What happened earlier?

1289
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,635
Jahnavi, l tried calling you,
but you wouldn't answer.

1290
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,902
Did you call to apologize
or to argue?

1291
01:34:04,366 --> 01:34:06,267
Oh, so l am arguing now?

1292
01:34:20,266 --> 01:34:22,668
l am very sorry.l don't
know what to say.

1293
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,767
Listen, l need to wake
up early tomorrow..

1294
01:34:25,633 --> 01:34:28,569
One last time.. give me one
chance. Let me explain.

1295
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:36,833
l'm listening.

1296
01:34:36,899 --> 01:34:38,935
Jahnavi, l know you
gave me a lot of..

1297
01:34:39,166 --> 01:34:42,702
..opportunities to become
a better person.

1298
01:34:44,466 --> 01:34:46,668
And it's not like l have
not tried either.

1299
01:34:46,733 --> 01:34:49,268
lt's iust that l
am in a complete

1300
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:54,769
opportunities to become
a better person.

1301
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,568
Can you please give
me one last chance?

1302
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,401
Well, l can understand.

1303
01:35:02,466 --> 01:35:05,101
You owe that import-export
guy seven lakhs, right?

1304
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:09,635
We can pay it from my savings.

1305
01:35:09,833 --> 01:35:14,170
You are so sweet Jahnavi.
And l am so selfish.

1306
01:35:15,366 --> 01:35:18,235
l bought a nice phone for you
and l kept if for myself.

1307
01:35:19,399 --> 01:35:22,569
lt's okay. l won't really use
all the features anyway.

1308
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:28,736
Jahnavi, there's another
problem.-Now what?

1309
01:35:29,233 --> 01:35:32,402
Please don't get angry,
l am coming clean here.

1310
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:35,902
l owe this Bombay bookie some..

1311
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,534
..20 lakh rupees.

1312
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,302
How will we manage that now?

1313
01:35:48,266 --> 01:35:49,834
l borrowed some money..

1314
01:35:50,699 --> 01:35:52,701
..from a client

1315
01:35:52,833 --> 01:35:55,235
. without asking

1316
01:35:55,533 --> 01:35:57,534
You stole money from the office!

1317
01:35:57,733 --> 01:35:59,835
And l lost it!. -What!!

1318
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,302
But l didn't lose
it, these thugs

1319
01:36:03,366 --> 01:36:06,569
from the Bombay bookie lost it.

1320
01:36:06,699 --> 01:36:09,169
Thugs?-Actually they
are not that bad.

1321
01:36:09,566 --> 01:36:11,734
And

1322
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:14,167
We are now good friends.

1323
01:36:14,233 --> 01:36:15,767
You are friends with thugs?

1324
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:17,734
Oh God! This is getting worse!

1325
01:36:18,233 --> 01:36:20,702
Please don't worry.

1326
01:36:20,766 --> 01:36:23,135
l'll clear up this
mess very soon.

1327
01:36:23,533 --> 01:36:26,068
But, please give me another
chance. One last chance.

1328
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,401
Hello, Jahnavi, say something.

1329
01:36:37,699 --> 01:36:40,202
My phone still thinks
it's my birthday..

1330
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,368
how do l change the ring tone?

1331
01:36:55,366 --> 01:36:57,735
Don't even think about
it. -About what?

1332
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,668
Whatever you were
thinking about.

1333
01:37:03,233 --> 01:37:05,602
l was iust..

1334
01:37:06,533 --> 01:37:06,966
Not even that.

1335
01:37:08,133 --> 01:37:08,133
l didn't even say anything.

1336
01:37:09,433 --> 01:37:12,435
Good, then don't.

1337
01:37:18,433 --> 01:37:20,735
Well, l thought that you too..

1338
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:25,970
Yeah, me too. So?

1339
01:37:30,966 --> 01:37:32,567
So? Forget it!

1340
01:37:42,199 --> 01:37:44,735
Big day tomorrow, huh?

1341
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:47,535
Yeah. Big day.

1342
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:33,602
Let's teach Mr. Cousin a lesson.

1343
01:38:37,433 --> 01:38:40,903
Are you watching this?
Learn something.

1344
01:38:43,033 --> 01:38:46,136
Turn him around.

1345
01:38:49,033 --> 01:38:50,667
Enough of being James Bond!

1346
01:38:50,899 --> 01:38:54,003
Shall we go now?

1347
01:39:59,033 --> 01:40:01,168
Look, you have two options.

1348
01:40:01,366 --> 01:40:04,001
One, which you like.

1349
01:40:05,133 --> 01:40:08,336
The other, which l.. no

1350
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:12,236
you.. no, l like..

1351
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:13,901
Remember your dialogue first,
then try to talk.

1352
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:28,034
Hello, AGM-bhai

1353
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,568
l can't hear your
voice, AGM-bhai

1354
01:40:34,133 --> 01:40:36,168
l've caught the smartass,
he's here..

1355
01:40:36,233 --> 01:40:38,168
Didn't find Fatso..

1356
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:40,335
Network's bad out here..

1357
01:40:49,166 --> 01:40:51,768
l'll find fatso and l'll take
care of him as well..

1358
01:41:00,233 --> 01:41:03,002
Yes, l looked for him all over.

1359
01:41:12,966 --> 01:41:15,968
No, bhai, you don't need to come.
l'll take care of everything.

1360
01:41:23,433 --> 01:41:25,935
That's why l say -mobile phones
are injurious to health!

1361
01:41:48,866 --> 01:41:52,336
How did you get here?
Anyone with you?

1362
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:54,235
No one!

1363
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:56,201
Then be quiet!

1364
01:42:01,433 --> 01:42:03,334
What the..

1365
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,403
Hey, Satya!

1366
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:18,401
l know you are hiding
somewhere here.

1367
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:22,469
Ah ha, got you!

1368
01:42:23,699 --> 01:42:26,302
You can hide, but you cannot
hide your big fat ass!

1369
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:30,402
Come out of there.

1370
01:42:30,466 --> 01:42:34,870
Wagging your tail, eh? You
want some sugarcane?

1371
01:42:42,766 --> 01:42:44,701
And they always ring
at the wrong time!

1372
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:54,101
Sachin, l got hurt.

1373
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,368
Shall we go? -Sure.

1374
01:43:38,733 --> 01:43:42,670
My God.. What the hell happened?

1375
01:43:43,033 --> 01:43:45,735
No big deal, you should have
seen the other guy!

1376
01:43:46,699 --> 01:43:49,302
Stop ioking. It's not funny!

1377
01:43:58,699 --> 01:44:01,836
Hey, what do you do inside
that you go so many times?

1378
01:44:02,033 --> 01:44:03,667
There was more butter
and less chicken..

1379
01:44:03,733 --> 01:44:04,834
..in yesterday's butter-chicken.

1380
01:44:08,766 --> 01:44:11,602
Hello? Do you know what's
happening in the match?

1381
01:44:11,899 --> 01:44:13,968
Why? What's happening?

1382
01:44:22,266 --> 01:44:25,302
Tendulkar is in form and
he's hit a century!

1383
01:44:25,366 --> 01:44:28,769
l thought as much. JC played us.

1384
01:44:33,933 --> 01:44:34,933
Yes!

1385
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,334
Hey! What are you doing?

1386
01:44:36,566 --> 01:44:38,801
You know we're rooting for
South Africa, right?

1387
01:44:38,866 --> 01:44:40,033
lf India wins, we're finished!

1388
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,602
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

1389
01:45:36,866 --> 01:45:38,567
Get your own drink.

1390
01:45:38,633 --> 01:45:40,735
Just let me watch the
match, will you?

1391
01:46:03,699 --> 01:46:05,568
These guys are good for nothing.

1392
01:46:05,633 --> 01:46:07,601
They can't field,
they can't run..

1393
01:46:07,666 --> 01:46:09,100
They can't even bat
for 50 overs.

1394
01:46:09,166 --> 01:46:10,200
20 overs are good
enough for them.

1395
01:46:10,433 --> 01:46:11,867
ln fact, if there were
a 20 over match..

1396
01:46:11,933 --> 01:46:13,567
..they'd become world champions!

1397
01:46:56,466 --> 01:46:58,501
Never in my life have l wanted..

1398
01:46:58,566 --> 01:47:00,567
..lndia to lose. Except today.

1399
01:47:33,766 --> 01:47:35,134
l've always supported India..

1400
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:36,767
..And they always lost
and let me down.

1401
01:47:36,833 --> 01:47:38,901
The one time l wanted
India to lose..

1402
01:47:38,966 --> 01:47:41,068
..they won, and l lost!

1403
01:47:41,133 --> 01:47:43,902
The match is over and so are we.

1404
01:47:43,966 --> 01:47:45,701
We came so close to
making a century!

1405
01:47:45,733 --> 01:47:47,401
lt's like we got out on
99, just one run short!

1406
01:47:47,466 --> 01:47:49,167
But what's the use, you
get a standing..

1407
01:47:49,399 --> 01:47:50,701
..ovation only after you
hit that one run.

1408
01:47:50,766 --> 01:47:52,901
No one remembers the
other 99 runs.

1409
01:48:05,433 --> 01:48:07,434
Hey, isn't this a taxi?

1410
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:08,901
Where is the meter?

1411
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:10,468
There isn't one, sir.

1412
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:11,801
Delhi is pretty weird!

1413
01:48:11,866 --> 01:48:14,501
Taxis don't have meters and
it's still chilly in March!

1414
01:48:14,866 --> 01:48:16,500
Come on, move it!

1415
01:48:24,699 --> 01:48:25,901
One whiskey please..

1416
01:48:28,633 --> 01:48:30,067
What?

1417
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:32,367
What?

1418
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:34,534
What?

1419
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:36,534
What?

1420
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:37,801
What what?

1421
01:48:40,966 --> 01:48:42,434
What happened Rahul?

1422
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:49,836
l was on my way to
place the bet..

1423
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,701
..and all the signs were wrong.

1424
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,902
Accident.. fight.

1425
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:00,736
By my calculations India
should win this match.

1426
01:49:00,899 --> 01:49:02,334
But l listened to him!

1427
01:49:02,666 --> 01:49:04,300
You should've never trusted JC.

1428
01:49:05,533 --> 01:49:08,235
Why would he help me? Why?

1429
01:49:08,633 --> 01:49:10,968
l beat him so badly at poker.

1430
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,268
l caught his bluff.

1431
01:49:14,266 --> 01:49:15,667
Why would he still help me?

1432
01:49:15,899 --> 01:49:18,235
He kept saying..

1433
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,768
..bet on the foreigners.

1434
01:49:20,833 --> 01:49:22,367
Bet everything on
the foreigners.

1435
01:49:23,733 --> 01:49:26,268
This time too l caught
his bluff.

1436
01:49:26,866 --> 01:49:28,434
And l bet on India.

1437
01:49:30,966 --> 01:49:32,033
What?

1438
01:49:33,266 --> 01:49:35,935
That means.. we won?

1439
01:49:41,433 --> 01:49:43,001
We won 10 bucks.

1440
01:49:45,933 --> 01:49:48,702
Go to this address, show
the serial number..

1441
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,501
..on this bill, And you'll
get the money.

1442
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,301
How much did we win?

1443
01:49:52,566 --> 01:49:53,900
That's written too.

1444
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:59,769
Units, 10's, 100's 1000's, one
Iakh, ten lakh, crore..

1445
01:50:01,033 --> 01:50:02,467
My God!

1446
01:50:02,533 --> 01:50:03,667
We won a lot!

1447
01:50:04,633 --> 01:50:05,800
How did we win so much?

1448
01:50:05,866 --> 01:50:08,535
l bet on India to win. And
placed a side-bet on Tendulkar.

1449
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,234
And he made a century!

1450
01:50:23,766 --> 01:50:25,367
What we heard on the
recorder was going..

1451
01:50:25,433 --> 01:50:26,967
..to shock the whole
cricketing world!

1452
01:50:28,166 --> 01:50:30,568
The match was fixed, BUT
with the foreigners.

1453
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:34,502
JC and the touring captain were
deciding the fate of the match.

1454
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,868
Who would score how much..

1455
01:50:37,933 --> 01:50:40,702
..and who would get out when!

1456
01:50:42,566 --> 01:50:44,567
The game hadn't even
started and..

1457
01:50:45,433 --> 01:50:48,435
the foreigners had already
decided to lose

1458
01:52:21,766 --> 01:52:23,567
The entire conversation
is recorded on..

1459
01:52:23,699 --> 01:52:26,302
..this tape, sir. On side
A and on side B..

1460
01:52:29,866 --> 01:52:31,334
This isn't some ioke, is it?

1461
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:32,801
Why would l ioke, sir?

1462
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:35,569
But please leave us out
of this mess, sir.

1463
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:38,435
lt will create huge
problems for us.

1464
01:52:39,399 --> 01:52:41,168
Why are you doing this?

1465
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:44,302
Sir, you had said on TV that
cricket is a religion in India.

1466
01:52:44,566 --> 01:52:46,567
l belong to that religion
too, sir.

1467
01:52:46,733 --> 01:52:48,801
When the game is on, l
don't even shower..

1468
01:52:50,633 --> 01:52:51,700
l'm leaving now.

1469
01:52:53,766 --> 01:52:54,900
Listen.

1470
01:52:55,266 --> 01:52:56,333
Yes, sir.

1471
01:52:59,333 --> 01:53:00,634
lf you have any dealings
with any bookies..

1472
01:53:00,699 --> 01:53:02,601
No no.. no dealings at all..

1473
01:53:03,733 --> 01:53:05,201
..stay away from them.

1474
01:53:05,533 --> 01:53:06,767
There's a raid going on today.

1475
01:53:07,433 --> 01:53:08,734
A lot of people are
getting arrested.

1476
01:53:22,133 --> 01:53:24,435
He took Rahul's mobile with him,
but he's not answering.

1477
01:53:24,733 --> 01:53:26,101
He's not used to mobiles,
you see.

1478
01:53:33,066 --> 01:53:34,167
Hey, you're ringing.

1479
01:53:49,533 --> 01:53:50,767
Hello, who's speaking?

1480
01:53:51,133 --> 01:53:52,634
lt's me, Zara.

1481
01:53:54,433 --> 01:53:55,767
Zara! How are you?

1482
01:53:56,266 --> 01:53:59,035
All well here, what's
up with you?

1483
01:53:59,233 --> 01:54:01,835
You're both crazy! Sachin, run!

1484
01:54:02,066 --> 01:54:04,468
The police are making a raid
on all the bookies.

1485
01:54:04,533 --> 01:54:06,468
Leave the money and run.

1486
01:54:23,966 --> 01:54:25,400
ls there another
way out of here?

1487
01:54:25,733 --> 01:54:26,967
Thanks.

1488
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:21,834
Guy with blue iacket, red bag.

1489
01:56:21,899 --> 01:56:22,867
Just ran from Palika Bazaar.

1490
01:57:11,433 --> 01:57:13,835
Hello. -Sachin, are
you all right?

1491
01:57:14,866 --> 01:57:16,467
Zaramud was saying something
about a police raid..

1492
01:57:16,533 --> 01:57:18,902
Things are bad. Cops
are after me.

1493
01:57:19,433 --> 01:57:20,934
They've even reached the hotel.

1494
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,267
l need to get out of here.

1495
01:57:22,333 --> 01:57:24,501
Listen, you get to your house,
l'll meet you there.

1496
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,968
ls Zaramud with you?
-What do you mean?

1497
01:57:27,966 --> 01:57:29,767
ls he with you or not?

1498
01:58:36,366 --> 01:58:38,000
Sachin.. Sachin.. open the door.

1499
01:58:51,399 --> 01:58:53,368
Get out of the car!

1500
01:58:54,966 --> 01:58:57,001
Where is my money?

1501
01:58:58,833 --> 01:59:00,935
You think you guys
are very smart?

1502
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:02,434
How did he get in?

1503
01:59:02,933 --> 01:59:06,336
Shut up. You want to know?
Once upon a time_}?

1504
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:09,335
Where is my money?

1505
01:59:10,766 --> 01:59:13,135
Well.. we bet it on
a cricket match.

1506
01:59:13,333 --> 01:59:16,803
You bet MY money on
a match! How dare..

1507
01:59:16,866 --> 01:59:18,767
And we won! -What?

1508
01:59:18,833 --> 01:59:21,235
Yes, we won! -Where
is the money then?

1509
01:59:23,766 --> 01:59:25,701
ln the bag.

1510
01:59:33,633 --> 01:59:36,369
What the..! It's a lot of money!

1511
01:59:36,933 --> 01:59:39,802
What do you mean, you don't have
the money? l am an idiot?

1512
01:59:40,166 --> 01:59:43,402
Now, you are going to get it.

1513
01:59:45,133 --> 01:59:47,802
What are you going to do?

1514
01:59:48,233 --> 01:59:51,970
Hey, Shera, wait! How
will l go back?

1515
01:59:52,966 --> 01:59:54,767
How many times have l told you?

1516
01:59:54,833 --> 01:59:57,368
l am trying to change but
you guys won't let me be.

1517
01:59:57,433 --> 01:59:59,301
'Where is my money?
Where is my money?'

1518
01:59:59,366 --> 02:00:01,901
Give it back. It's not
a toy. It'll go off!

1519
02:00:01,966 --> 02:00:04,868
Nothing will happen!

1520
02:00:11,566 --> 02:00:13,367
Sorry, yaar. It was an accident!

1521
02:00:13,699 --> 02:00:16,202
Holy shit! l told
you it is real..

1522
02:00:16,266 --> 02:00:19,168
but you wouldn't listen.
Oh God, it hurts!

1523
02:00:19,233 --> 02:00:22,936
l am very sorry.. -Shera
is also gone..

1524
02:00:23,366 --> 02:00:26,001
..give me your car keys.

1525
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:29,268
Now you want my piece-of-crap?

1526
02:00:29,333 --> 02:00:31,835
Shut up and give me
the keys fast.

1527
02:00:32,666 --> 02:00:35,235
Hold on for a second, l need
to take out my house keys.

1528
02:00:38,666 --> 02:00:42,236
Drive safely, okay?
l am so sorry.

1529
02:00:42,566 --> 02:00:45,602
lf my hand doesn't get
better, l'll kill you.

1530
02:00:51,566 --> 02:00:53,801
Hospital is in Vasant Kuni.

1531
02:00:53,866 --> 02:00:55,634
l know that!

1532
02:00:56,833 --> 02:00:58,634
l have to hand it to
you guys, though

1533
02:00:58,866 --> 02:01:01,301
l've had my men for years now.

1534
02:01:01,699 --> 02:01:04,836
But they've never earned me so
much. They don't have your wits.

1535
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:08,268
But you still owe me
a lot of money.

1536
02:01:08,766 --> 02:01:11,935
And you owe me Rahul's. And
that Bhojpuri actor's.

1537
02:01:12,133 --> 02:01:13,834
And you've knocked
out my main man.

1538
02:01:13,899 --> 02:01:15,835
And for that l'd have
to kill you.

1539
02:01:17,166 --> 02:01:18,767
So.. this is how it's gonna be.

1540
02:01:18,833 --> 02:01:21,101
l'll tell you how it's gonna be.

1541
02:01:27,166 --> 02:01:29,935
This bag contains more
than enough..

1542
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,335
..to clear our dues
and your losses.

1543
02:01:33,066 --> 02:01:34,767
A lot more.

1544
02:01:34,966 --> 02:01:37,702
But l say, you keep it.

1545
02:01:37,966 --> 02:01:42,937
And we're all cleared.

1546
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,001
And Rahul too.

1547
02:01:45,066 --> 02:01:47,835
Absolutely, fair deal! Of
course, this settles everything.

1548
02:01:47,899 --> 02:01:50,202
Anyway, l'm fed up of Delhi.
Everyone is a crook here.

1549
02:01:50,266 --> 02:01:52,768
And the taxis don't
even have meters.

1550
02:01:52,833 --> 02:01:55,335
We told you so. And the cold
here..Why the hell is it still..

1551
02:01:55,566 --> 02:01:58,101
,,chilly in March! -Why don't
you take my jacket?

1552
02:01:58,366 --> 02:02:00,735
And have a safe trip back.

1553
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,168
Really? You don't need it?

1554
02:02:02,233 --> 02:02:04,201
Well, l've gotten used to
Delhi now. You take it.

1555
02:02:04,266 --> 02:02:05,900
All right, thank you!

1556
02:03:32,166 --> 02:03:34,468
Thanks, for everything.

1557
02:03:34,966 --> 02:03:36,567
No problem.

1558
02:03:40,733 --> 02:03:43,168
l should leave. Have
a nice flight.

1559
02:03:44,899 --> 02:03:49,037
Hey Pooia, can l ask
you something?

1560
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,968
lt's better if you don't.

1561
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:55,236
Let me at least give it a shot.

1562
02:03:58,566 --> 02:04:00,901
Okay.

1563
02:04:02,366 --> 02:04:03,867
Do you..

1564
02:04:06,766 --> 02:04:08,868
Will you come with me to Mumbai?

1565
02:04:11,166 --> 02:04:13,701
What will l do there?
-What do you mean?

1566
02:04:14,466 --> 02:04:17,135
We have our coffee-shop,
partners right?

1567
02:04:17,566 --> 02:04:19,534
But there is no coffee-shop.

1568
02:04:20,566 --> 02:04:23,168
There will be one. Pretty soon.

1569
02:04:24,166 --> 02:04:27,168
l'll tell you what. Why don't
you work on opening one.

1570
02:04:28,033 --> 02:04:29,934
And l'll ioin you very soon.

1571
02:04:35,633 --> 02:04:37,067
Okay.

1572
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:40,735
i'm leaving now.

1573
02:04:59,133 --> 02:05:01,535
Okay, bye.

1574
02:05:12,333 --> 02:05:14,635
Hello, Rahul. What's going on?

1575
02:05:14,899 --> 02:05:17,736
l haven't received my money yet.

1576
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:19,768
l came to your office
yesterday..

1577
02:05:19,833 --> 02:05:21,334
..but they said you
were on vacation!

1578
02:05:21,399 --> 02:05:22,601
l am coming over right now.

1579
02:05:22,866 --> 02:05:24,767
Can l pay you by cheque?
-No, cheque won't do.

1580
02:05:24,966 --> 02:05:28,836
l want my money back. l am
coming there right now.

1581
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:35,901
Fine, come on over.

1582
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:42,536
God, save me from this
mess one last..

1583
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,969
..time and l'll never
gamble again. 1000/o

1584
02:05:48,066 --> 02:05:51,636
Sir, he wants to see you.

1585
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:54,535
What are you doing here?

1586
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:57,002
You lost your briefcase,
right? -Yes.

1587
02:05:57,933 --> 02:05:59,868
What was in it?

1588
02:06:01,333 --> 02:06:03,501
Well it had.. what the
hell do you want?

1589
02:06:03,566 --> 02:06:04,967
You were never good to me.

1590
02:06:05,033 --> 02:06:07,368
And you never bought
anything from me.

1591
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:11,537
Get out of here. l am going
to call the security. Out!

1592
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,702
How badly do you want this?

1593
02:06:21,833 --> 02:06:24,735
What was in it? -l don't know.
Some files and crap.

1594
02:06:24,899 --> 02:06:26,901
lf there was anything valuable..

1595
02:06:26,966 --> 02:06:29,535
..others must have
taken it already.

1596
02:06:41,699 --> 02:06:45,236
But this won't come cheap.
It's going to cost you!

1597
02:06:45,933 --> 02:06:47,901
What do you want?

1598
02:06:47,966 --> 02:06:50,601
You'll need to buy a new
briefcase. No discount.

1599
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:53,401
One Thousand Rupees.

1600
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,301
Seven Hundred.

1601
02:07:01,366 --> 02:07:03,334
Okay, lover boy. If you've
finished romancing..

1602
02:07:03,399 --> 02:07:05,168
..can we get to the airport?

1603
02:07:05,233 --> 02:07:06,934
What's your hurry? You
have an important..

1604
02:07:07,166 --> 02:07:08,634
..meeting to attend in Mumbai?

1605
02:07:08,899 --> 02:07:11,402
l wonder if we should stay
back for a few days.

1606
02:07:11,733 --> 02:07:13,301
The weather is getting better.

1607
02:07:13,366 --> 02:07:14,433
There is no more AGM. That
means, no more credit card.

1608
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:16,468
Who is going to pay for
all this? Your pop?

1609
02:07:16,533 --> 02:07:19,168
Shut up! Why do you pull
my pop into this?

1610
02:07:19,333 --> 02:07:21,568
Sachin-bhai. Fancy
meeting you here!

1611
02:07:22,166 --> 02:07:24,868
Who are you? -Me?
l'm Kewal Pandey!

1612
02:07:26,399 --> 02:07:29,736
Oh sorry, l didn't recognize..

1613
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:31,968
..you with your new hair style.

1614
02:07:32,199 --> 02:07:33,434
lt looks good.

1615
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:35,869
You're staying here? -We
were. Now we are..

1616
02:07:35,933 --> 02:07:37,934
..heading back to Mumbai.

1617
02:07:38,166 --> 02:07:39,867
Mumbai? -Yes. -Mumbai.

1618
02:07:40,699 --> 02:07:42,835
Your AGM called and he
was pretty pissed.

1619
02:07:43,366 --> 02:07:47,169
He wanted me to bring the rest
of the money to Mumbai.

1620
02:07:47,766 --> 02:07:50,268
l somehow managed to arrange
for the money.

1621
02:07:50,333 --> 02:07:52,301
Can you do me a favour?

1622
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:55,435
Can you deliver this to AGM?

1623
02:07:55,633 --> 02:07:57,634
What's in it? -Money.

1624
02:08:02,133 --> 02:08:06,303
But it's going to take
us a long drive..

1625
02:08:06,366 --> 02:08:08,501
..to get to AGM, with
the traffic and all..

1626
02:08:08,566 --> 02:08:10,100
But, we will do it!

1627
02:08:10,166 --> 02:08:12,434
Kewal-ii, we are going to do
this favour, just for you!

1628
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:15,202
Thank you very much. Thank
you, big brother!

1629
02:08:33,333 --> 02:08:35,168
lt's not about hitting
the century.

1630
02:08:35,233 --> 02:08:37,134
lt's about how well you played.

1631
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:39,669
But all this wisdom hits you,
only after you hit the century

1632
02:08:39,733 --> 02:08:42,502
Damn! It feels good
to make a century!
