After the assassination of his father,

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:01.675
the young King Louis XIII
ascends to the French throne.

4
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.473
His once peaceful nation
is surrounded by enemies on all sides.

5
00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:14.692
Within the borders of France itself,
Cardinal Richelieu, the King's advisor,

6
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.365
plots in secret to seize power for himself.

7
00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:21.073
The inexperienced Louis
and his new bride, Queen Anne,

8
00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:23.246
find themselves without a single friend.

9
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.204
Europe is a powder keg waiting to explode

10
00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:28.911
in a war that will engulf the entire continent.

11
00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:33.086

can prevent the coming apocalypse.

Getting careless?

20
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.513
The feeling is mutual.

21
00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.611
For future reference, "I love you"
would have been a more suitable reply.

(GASPS)

23
00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.942
Could have just said, "Hello."

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.993
What would be the fun in that?

25
00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:28.785
- How was the bishop?
- Not as good as you.

26
00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:30.699
You are incorrigible.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.125
To my horse.

(BUTTERCUP SNORTING)

183
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.168
You've hurt her feelings.

184
00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:13.135
And if I don't?

185
00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:15.345
I shall have to kill you.

186
00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.475
(CHUCKLING)

187
00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.192
You shot me!

188
00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.736
Most observant of you, young man.

189
00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.740
But the real question is,
why are you not dead?

190
00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:36.700
Flesh wound.

191
00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:40.071
Sight must be off.
Who takes care of my pistols?

192
00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.864
Captain Rochefort, I...

(GRUNTS)

194
00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:46.919
Whoa, whoa, steady.

195
00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:49.000
Wouldn’t want to dirty my blade
with peasant blood.

(GROANING)

197
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:51.757
So, boy,

198
00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.714
consider this a lesson.

199
00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:54.877
Your last.

200
00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:57.421
MILADY: No.

201
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:03.560
He's too pretty for that.

202
00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.056
As you wish, Milady.

203
00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:10.939
Rochefort, come.

204
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.066
We're expected in Paris.

205

ROCHEFORT: Make way!

208
00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:43.861
I think you've had enough.

209
00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.247
Where's my tankard?

210
00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:49.875
D'ARTAGNAN: Excuse me!

211
00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:53.879
You think you're better than me?

212
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.540
No.

214
00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:59.126
All for one.

215
00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:01.178
Excuse me!

216
00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:04.135
-Sorry! I'm sorry!
-Are you blind?

217
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.221
Look, I'm chasing after a man
who insulted my horse

218
00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:07.472
and tried to kill me, so let me go!

219
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:10.225
That's not good enough.
You spilled my drink and ruined my shirt.

220
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:11.806
I'm in a hurry.

221
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.232
(GROANS)

222
00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:16.902
-Here.
-10 sous?

223
00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:20.356
-Who do you think you're talking to?
-The town drunk, from the smell of you.

224
00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.859
Now that, my boy, is fighting talk.

225
00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:26.995
-What are you saying exactly?
-Blind and deaf.

226
00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:29.369
Fortunately for you,
I'm somewhat of a doctor.

227
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.246
Great! When can you fit me in?

229
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.250
I'll be there.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.249
Excuse me!

231
00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:41.301
I just can't decide.

232
00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:45.723
Well, if I might point out,
this does make you look very dignified,

233
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.098
whereas the blue one
brings out your dashing side.

234
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.811
Equally important.

235
00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:54.311
Dignified. Dashing.

236
00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:58.107
In the words of King Solomon, I'll take both!

237
00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:00.230
A most excellent choice, sir.

239
00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.613
Darling, you spoil me.

240
00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.945
I don't know how I shall ever repay you.

241
00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:09.698
-Watch yourself!
-My apologies.

242
00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.492
Matter of life and death. Won't happen
again. Believe you dropped this.

243
00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:14.952
This isn't mine.

244
00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.708
I saw the lady hand this to you,
I'm not blind.

245
00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:19.673
Are you implying that
I take money from this woman?

246
00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:22.293
Are you saying that I cannot afford to pay
for my own wardrobe?

247
00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:23.468
Do you know who I am?

248
00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:24.837
Do you know who I am?

249
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.050
No!

250
00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:27.473
Then we're even.

251
00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:31.310
You're in luck, boy.

252
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.473
Ordinarily, I would slaughter you
on the spot, but this is a brand-new jacket.

254

I suggest you dress for a funeral!

What?

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:55.581
-Lottery!
-There you go.

262
00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:14.348
It's a citation.

263
00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:17.189
It's a ticket.

264

-Hmm.
-Who's the opponent?

a sufficient challenge.

285

And he doesn't question your loyalty.

286

He thinks he's so cunning.

287
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.416
So evil.

288
00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:01.459
Evil is just a point of view.

Is this lady the emissary from England?

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:14.260
Your Majesty is exceptionally alert.

293

And you had the gall to recommend blue?

301
00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:40.289
Of course it should be green.

302
00:23:40.377 --> 00:23:44.541
Why am I surrounded
by incompetent idiots?

-Arrived this morning.
-You have been busy.

00:38:59.796 --> 00:39:01.002
Or was it 400?

536
00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:04.004
ATHOS: Just 40, Your Majesty.

537
00:39:04.259 --> 00:39:05.624
It was an off day.

538
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.749
(CHUCKLING)

539
00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:08.335
That's my Musketeers for you.

540
00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:11.171
By the time they write songs about them,
it’ll be 4, 000.

541
00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:12.756
I hope you won't be too harsh with them.

542
00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:16.054
After all, boys will be boys.

543
00:39:21.943 --> 00:39:23.103
You must be D'Artagnan.

544
00:39:24.237 --> 00:39:28.446
My lady-in-waiting has told me about
how brave and dashing you were yesterday.

545
00:39:29.117 --> 00:39:31.324
But you must try not to be so reckless.

546
00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:32.776
Can't help myself, Your Majesty.

547
00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:35.278
-Your Majesty, the culprits.
-Ah! Yes, yes.

548
00:39:37.834 --> 00:39:38.914
Well, stand up, then.

549
00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:47.206
Athos.

550
00:39:48.094 --> 00:39:49.300
Porthos.

551
00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:51.302
Aramis.

552
00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:58.807
Forgive me for saying this, D'Artagnan,
but you do look a little underdressed.

553
00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:02.396
My father is a poor man, Your Majesty.

554
00:40:02.984 --> 00:40:05.191
A former Musketeer as well.

555
00:40:05.653 --> 00:40:08.019
These are the only clothes I have.

556
00:40:09.032 --> 00:40:11.148
LOUIS XIII: Oh, Lord.
We shall have to rectify that.

557
00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:15.660
Can't have my Musketeers,
or the son of one, looking like tramps.

558
00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:19.452
New suits all around, I think.

559
00:40:20.209 --> 00:40:22.916
Yes. You’ll see to that, Cardinal?

560
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:27.631
And, yes, I think a purse of gold for each
as a reward for your courage.

561
00:40:27.717 --> 00:40:29.253
You’ll see to that as well, Cardinal.

562
00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:31.258
And, yes, before I forget,

563
00:40:31.346 --> 00:40:34.133
no more fighting
with His Eminence's guards.

564
00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:35.595
Hmm?

565
00:40:38.645 --> 00:40:40.351
Or there’ll be none of them left.

566
00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:41.852
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)

567
00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:44.855
Your Majesty, might I suggest a more...

568
00:40:44.943 --> 00:40:46.854
Forgive my impudence, Cardinal,

569
00:40:47.028 --> 00:40:49.394
but I doubt the King
requires your advice in this matter.

570
00:40:49.489 --> 00:40:51.650
After all, they are his Musketeers.

571
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.189
Good day, gentlemen.

572
00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:01.572
LOUIS XIII: Well, now, off with you rascals.

573
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:07.000
But be there for the parade tomorrow.
New suits and all.

574
00:41:08.925 --> 00:41:10.916
RICHELIEU: I tire of these royal children.

575
00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:14.218
It's time to make our move.

576
00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:18.180
We shall use Buckingham's arrival
to our advantage.

577
00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:20.262
During his visit, we will reveal

578
00:41:20.436 --> 00:41:23.803
that he arranged a secret rendezvous
with the Queen.

579
00:41:23.982 --> 00:41:27.395
May I inquire how Your Eminence
has uncovered this scandalous affair?

580
00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:32.104
By reading Buckingham's letters
to the Queen, found in her possession.

581
00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:35.193
Written in Buckingham's hand,
then authenticated by his seal?

582
00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:39.076
A woman of your talents
should have no trouble procuring either.

583
00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:41.738
Hmm. Your Eminence is too kind.

584
00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:44.074
However, I doubt that the King
will accept such letters

585
00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:47.626
as definitive proof of his wife's indiscretion.

586
00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:52.044
Then we shall provide him
with something a bit more substantial.

587
00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:56.837
A piece of the Queen's jewelry
given to Buckingham as a token of affection.

588
00:41:56.931 --> 00:41:59.092
Buckingham will be humiliated.

589
00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:00.635
The King will be outraged.

590
00:42:00.768 --> 00:42:03.259
The Queen will be executed.

591
00:42:03.688 --> 00:42:06.680
France will have no choice but to go to war.

592
00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:12.064
And in times like these, France will
naturally turn to a stronger leader.

593
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:18.321
Someone better equipped to rule a nation
than a cuckolded teenager with a grudge.

594
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.155
Hmm.

595
00:42:22.498 --> 00:42:24.910
Someone like Your Eminence.

Anchor aweigh!

601
00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:42.358
Damn his impudence!

602
00:43:43.496 --> 00:43:46.203
What is that thing called anyway, Richelieu?

603
00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:48.868
An airship, Your Majesty.

604
00:43:55.758 --> 00:43:58.795
-Why don't I have one of those?
-An oversight on our part.

605
00:43:58.886 --> 00:44:02.128
Right, right. Well, build me one.

00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:42.509
Blue.

610
00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:45.011
Oh.

611
00:44:50.021 --> 00:44:51.636
Your Majesty.

612
00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:54.271
Love the outfit.

613
00:44:54.609 --> 00:44:56.019
Very retro.

614
00:44:56.194 --> 00:44:57.525
We were all wearing those in London,

615
00:44:58.112 --> 00:45:01.855
when was it, last year or the year before?

616
00:45:03.284 --> 00:45:07.027
Lord Buckingham, I trust your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

617
00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:08.952
Not at all. No.

618
00:45:09.081 --> 00:45:10.287
On the contrary.

619
00:45:10.458 --> 00:45:14.326
Handles like a dream and keeps me
one step closer to heaven.

620

Cardinal.

621
00:45:21.302 --> 00:45:25.966
Of course, being a servant of God,
you have no need for such crude devices.

(CHUCKLES)

623
00:45:27.308 --> 00:45:30.300
King James is most eager
to hear your peace proposal.

-Lord Buckingham.
-Anne.

626
00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:38.311
I must say your beauty is far more radiant
than I remember.

627
00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:39.938
You've met before?

628
00:45:40.112 --> 00:45:41.522
A long time ago.

629
00:45:41.614 --> 00:45:44.572
An evening I shall cherish forever.

630
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.150
Right. Well, shall we?

631
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.911
Now this is a pleasant surprise.

632
00:45:56.003 --> 00:45:57.789
Another acquaintance of yours, I see.

633
00:45:58.214 --> 00:45:59.670
We've met, yes.

634
00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.753
As I recall, last I saw you,
you were on your knees as well.

635
00:46:04.387 --> 00:46:06.548
Most unfortunate habit.

636
00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:09.346
It's a habit I shall have to break
during our next encounter.

637
00:46:10.977 --> 00:46:12.842
I look forward to it.

638
00:46:13.646 --> 00:46:16.012
In the meantime, shall we talk peace?

(SIGHING)

640
00:46:21.737 --> 00:46:24.900
You must pass me the name
of your interior decorator.

641
00:46:25.574 --> 00:46:26.563
Wine?

642
00:46:27.034 --> 00:46:28.194
I don't drink.

643
00:46:28.786 --> 00:46:31.994
What about that rather nice bottle of
Bordeaux in your middle left-hand drawer?

644
00:46:33.082 --> 00:46:35.824
You must pass me the name
of your spy in the palace.

645
00:46:36.669 --> 00:46:38.330
And yours in mine.

646
00:46:41.048 --> 00:46:43.664
England cannot afford a war on two fronts.

647
00:46:43.843 --> 00:46:46.380
Both our nations
are stretched to breaking point.

648
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:50.554
A peace treaty would be
of immense strategic advantage.

649
00:46:50.725 --> 00:46:53.011
Whose advantage? Yours?

650
00:46:53.102 --> 00:46:54.091
Ours.

651
00:46:55.187 --> 00:47:00.227
I have a feeling my new war machines
will readdress the balance.

652
00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:04.393
Very impressive.

Oh, thank goodness.

and then a door slammed behind me.

What are you doing here?

675
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.697
His Majesty wants a word with me.
Imagine that.

Yes, lovely. Now, excuse me.

with His Majesty, maybe we could talk?

00:50:23.646 --> 00:50:26.934
He's always saying the wrong thing.
His palms are sweating.

711
00:50:27.566 --> 00:50:30.899
His heart's pumping so loud
he's afraid she might hear it.

712
00:50:31.153 --> 00:50:32.689
It's torture just to look at her.

713
00:50:33.656 --> 00:50:36.523
-Have you ever felt this way?
-Not until recently.

714
00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:42.491
So, what do we do?
I mean, my friend. What does he do?

715
00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:46.832
He should speak his heart.

716
00:50:47.586 --> 00:50:50.874
Be someone who cares for her
and isn't afraid to show it.

717
00:50:53.592 --> 00:50:55.002
Be himself.

718
00:50:55.427 --> 00:50:57.167
Well, that's what I told him.

719
00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:59.090
Well, then he's doubly lucky.

720
00:50:59.473 --> 00:51:01.964
After all, he does have
Your Majesty as a friend.

721
00:51:02.142 --> 00:51:05.885
Yes. Yes. It's good to have friends.

722
00:51:09.358 --> 00:51:11.314
Will you excuse me just for one moment?

723
00:51:12.236 --> 00:51:13.646
I don't believe it.

724
00:51:14.154 --> 00:51:15.360
(CLEARING THROAT)

725
00:51:20.828 --> 00:51:21.863
How are you?

726
00:51:22.538 --> 00:51:23.778
Very well.

727
00:51:26.375 --> 00:51:27.831
I'm wearing blue.

728
00:51:28.669 --> 00:51:30.000
And you look very handsome in it.

729
00:51:30.337 --> 00:51:31.417
(CHUCKLES SELF-CONSCIOUSLY)

730
00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:36.090
Thank you. Yes, I...
You're looking just very lovely.

731
00:51:36.176 --> 00:51:40.089
In fact, I was only just remarking
to D'Artagnan how...

732
00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:43.555
How beautiful you are.

733
00:51:45.477 --> 00:51:46.557
Thank you, My Lord.

734
00:51:59.867 --> 00:52:01.323
(SPRAYING)

735
00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:22.730
RICHELIEU: How did it go?
MILADY: Clockwork.

736
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.280
RICHELIEU: Good.

737
00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:28.527
You'll go back to London
with Buckingham and the diamonds.

738
00:53:28.706 --> 00:53:30.321
MILADY: And what should I do with them?

739
00:53:30.499 --> 00:53:34.242
Put them in his personal vault,
the most secure location in all of England.

740
00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.285
-The Tower of London.
-Yup.

741
00:53:37.423 --> 00:53:40.460
When the scandal breaks,
he’ll deny everything.

742
00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:43.133
But once the diamonds
are discovered in his possession...

743
00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:46.003
He would have led England to war
through his indiscretion.

744
00:53:47.766 --> 00:53:50.883
And what of the future of France?

745
00:53:53.272 --> 00:53:54.637
I am France.

746
00:54:04.324 --> 00:54:05.985
One last thing.

747
00:54:08.996 --> 00:54:12.113
I suppose it's quite easy,
perhaps even tempting,

748
00:54:12.207 --> 00:54:15.324
for a double agent to play both sides.

749
00:54:16.545 --> 00:54:19.753
Have I given Your Eminence
any reason to doubt my loyalty?

750
00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.455
Spare me the rhetoric.

751
00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.547
I know who you are. I know what you are.

752
00:54:27.014 --> 00:54:30.598
You have a gift for corruption
and a penchant for betrayal.

753
00:54:30.684 --> 00:54:32.515
I admire such skills.

754
00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:35.932
But I'll destroy you the moment I suspect

755
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:38.431
you might be using them against me.

756
00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:42.310
Do we understand one another?

757
00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:45.688
There

758
00:54:46.867 --> 00:54:49.074
is another side to that coin.

759
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:53.909
It's quite easy for an employer
to sever all ties with his operative,

760
00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:57.833
in the event that they are compromised,
leaving them to

761
00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.957
rot in jail or on the gallows.

762
00:55:03.258 --> 00:55:04.964
Your point being?

763
00:55:06.637 --> 00:55:10.175
I require a guarantee
that I shall not suffer a similar fate.

764
00:55:12.059 --> 00:55:14.550
An insurance policy, if you will.

765
00:55:15.646 --> 00:55:17.637
-My word should suffice.
-(SCOFFS)

766
00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:21.683
I'm afraid I'll need something a bit more

767
00:55:23.195 --> 00:55:24.560
substantial.

768
00:55:27.407 --> 00:55:30.991
(RICHELIEU'S VOICE) "It is by my order
and for the good of the State

769
00:55:31.078 --> 00:55:35.162
"that the bearer of this
has done what has been done."

770
00:55:35.749 --> 00:55:37.114
Satisfied?

771
00:55:37.543 --> 00:55:38.623
Immensely.

772
00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:46.381
Your Majesty.

773
00:55:46.844 --> 00:55:47.833
Purple?

774
00:55:50.097 --> 00:55:52.304
Fashion favors the bold.

775
00:55:53.684 --> 00:55:54.673
Here.

776
00:55:54.977 --> 00:55:56.592
Try this for size.

777
00:55:58.146 --> 00:55:59.135
Oh, well.

778
00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:00.937
Do give my regards to the Queen.

779
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:05.313
I will convey your diplomatic proposal
to King James immediately.

780
00:56:05.487 --> 00:56:08.320
Cardinal Richelieu, a pleasure.

781
00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.272
All mine.

782
00:56:16.415 --> 00:56:17.825
Your Eminence.

783
00:56:37.603 --> 00:56:38.558
LOUIS XIII: Richelieu!

784
00:56:38.645 --> 00:56:39.760
Richelieu!

785
00:56:40.606 --> 00:56:42.688
There has been
the most distressing development.

786
00:56:42.816 --> 00:56:44.101
Certain letters,

787
00:56:44.192 --> 00:56:47.229
love letters, were discovered
in the Queen's possession.

788
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:48.561
Letters from him.

789
00:56:48.989 --> 00:56:51.230
Buckingham, of course! Who else?

790
00:56:51.325 --> 00:56:53.407
Have you spoken to the Queen
about these letters?

791
00:56:53.619 --> 00:56:56.827
No. Of course I haven't.
She’ll just deny the whole thing!

792
00:56:57.164 --> 00:56:58.199
Hmm.

793
00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:00.997
I can see Your Majesty's dilemma.

794
00:57:01.919 --> 00:57:05.252
Is there any mention
of a specific encounter? A detail?

795
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.752
-A token of affection, perhaps?
-Yes.

796
00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:10.291
Yes, there is.

797
00:57:10.802 --> 00:57:14.545
A necklace. The one I gave her
for our anniversary. Here.

798
00:57:14.723 --> 00:57:18.432
"I shall always cherish
the 12 studded diamonds you gave me,"

799
00:57:19.019 --> 00:57:21.260
"the proof of our consummated love."

800
00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:25.355
Does "consummated" mean
what I think it means?

801
00:57:25.567 --> 00:57:27.273
Yes, I'm afraid it does.

802
00:57:29.196 --> 00:57:30.561
Oh, my God!

803
00:57:31.573 --> 00:57:34.235
All Your Majesty has to do is throw a ball.

804
00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.866
What? How would that help?

805
00:57:37.037 --> 00:57:40.450
It would give Your Majesty the pretext
to suggest to the Queen

806
00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:41.746
that she wear your gift.

807
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.873
Oh, Richelieu, that's very clever.
That's very clever.

808
00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:49.500
So, if she has the diamonds...

809
00:57:49.758 --> 00:57:51.373
Your Majesty can rest easy.

810
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:54.630
And if she doesn't?

811
00:57:56.056 --> 00:57:59.048
He wants to have a celebration ball,
five days from now.

812
00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:01.888
Send my diamonds to the jeweler’s
to be polished.

813
00:58:02.229 --> 00:58:04.936
I want the King's undivided attention
that evening.

814
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:26.416
I hope I am not interrupting.

815
00:58:26.628 --> 00:58:29.335
Hardly, Your Majesty. To what do I owe...

816
00:58:29.423 --> 00:58:30.412
I know.

817
00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:34.292
Perhaps Your Majesty
would care to be a bit more specific?

818
00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:36.134
I know.

819
00:58:36.805 --> 00:58:37.840
Yeah.

820
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:40.798
I assume this is the part
where I'm supposed to laugh maniacally

821
00:58:40.892 --> 00:58:44.885
and regale Your Majesty with the details
of some diabolical plot.

822
00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.096
However, I regret to inform Your Majesty

823
00:58:48.275 --> 00:58:50.812
that I have no idea of
what you're talking about.

824
00:58:50.902 --> 00:58:52.517
I thought you'd say that.

825
00:58:52.779 --> 00:58:56.146
Then why did you grace me
with the honor of your visit?

826
00:58:56.616 --> 00:58:58.277
To look into your eyes when you said it.

827
00:59:07.836 --> 00:59:09.246
-Your Majesty.
-(SOBBING)

828
00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:14.630
All may not be lost yet.

829
00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:20.010
(BANGING ON DOOR)

830
00:59:20.307 --> 00:59:22.013
PLANCHET: Coming, coming!
Hold your horses!

831
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:24.550
It's not a matter of life or death, you know?

832
00:59:24.644 --> 00:59:26.475
Actually, it is.

833
00:59:26.813 --> 00:59:28.474
You want me to go to England,

834
00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:30.271
retrieve the diamonds,
which the Queen suspects

835
00:59:30.358 --> 00:59:32.314
might be in Buckingham's possession,

836
00:59:32.611 --> 00:59:34.727
which will naturally involve breaking into
some heavily fortified,

837
00:59:34.988 --> 00:59:37.070
highly impregnable facility?

838
00:59:37.157 --> 00:59:38.272
The Tower of London.

839
00:59:38.366 --> 00:59:41.233
Since the Cardinal’s spies
are trying to implicate the Duke,

840
00:59:41.328 --> 00:59:42.613
it is the most logical choice.

841
00:59:43.455 --> 00:59:47.164
Then return to Paris
with every soldier, assassin,

842
00:59:47.501 --> 00:59:50.208
mercenary, bounty hunter,

843
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:54.045
on both sides of the Channel
out to stop me from doing so.

844
00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:55.834
Did I miss anything?

845
00:59:56.343 --> 00:59:57.503
All in five days.

846
00:59:57.677 --> 00:59:59.793
A minor detail. Anything else?

847
01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.002
No.

848
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:04.089
Well, I really only have one question for you.

849
01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:07.134
Why in the world would I do that?

850
01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:16.939
England it is.

851
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.156
D'ARTAGNAN: Diamonds, Buckingham,
Tower of London, five days,

852
01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:24.656
Queen's reputation
and the fate of France as we know it.

853
01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:26.745
Who's with me?

854
01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:34.620
Well, I should imagine
the Queen would be quite generous.

855
01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:39.716
Count Porthos. Hmm? What do you think?
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

856
01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:44.342
Besides, I hear the English women
are a lot like a frosted bottle of champagne.

857
01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:47.181
Ice on the outside,
but once you warm them up...

858
01:00:47.936 --> 01:00:51.975
This isn't a great cause, but it’ll have to do.

859
01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:59.440
Buckingham's there, so is she.

860
01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:00.895
Who?

861
01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:02.906
Countess de Winter.

862
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.525
Charlotte Backson.

863
01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:07.152
Anne de Breuil. Lady Clarick.

864
01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:09.412
Milady.

865
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.080
Milady?

866
01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.625
I know her. I saw her with Rochefort.

867
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.540
PORTHOS: She's switched sides again.

868
01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:18.580
She's working for the Cardinal, no doubt.

869
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.131
What are you going to do if you catch her?

870
01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:25.420
ROCH EFORT: Musketeers, open up
and surrender by order of the Cardinal!

871
01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:27.589
-You were followed.
-It's Rochefort.

872
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:32.724
Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan,

873
01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:36.147
surrender your weapons
and no harm will come to you.

874
01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.897
The moment they step out,

875
01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:41.979
kill them.

876
01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:45.615
Light the torches!

877
01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:48.401
I'll count to five, then we’ll burn you out!

878
01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:55.207
One!

879
01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:56.743
Two!

880
01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.290
Three!

881
01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.376
Oh! Sorry! Didn't see you there.

882
01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:01.673
-JUSSAC: Damn you!
-(LAUGHS)

883
01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:06.962
JUSSAC: Fire!

884
01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:23.353
RICHELIEU: Let me guess.

885
01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:25.734
You've come to tell me
that the Musketeers are dead,

886
01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:28.567
our plan is proceeding on schedule,

887
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:31.529
and I have absolutely, positively,
nothing to worry about.

888
01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:34.823
We were taken by surprise, Your Eminence.

889
01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:37.538
Somehow I was laboring
under the assumption

890
01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:40.587
that the plan was for you
to take them by surprise.

891
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:44.256
-Was it not?
-Eminence...

892
01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.008
Yes, you are quite fond of that word,
aren't you?

893
01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:49.095
Sadly, repeating it
doesn't get you into my good graces.

894
01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:51.722
Alert Milady. Watch the ports.

895
01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:54.600
No one is to leave for England
without my official permission.

896
01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:56.682
Post a bounty on their heads.

897
01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:58.596
The bigger, the better.

898
01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:00.519
Yes, Your Eminence.

899
01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:02.066
Rochefort.

900
01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:07.321
Do not fail me again.

901
01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:21.499
ARAMIS: Jussac and a lot of help.
There's no way past.

902
01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.546
How the hell did he get here so fast?

903
01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.719
D'ARTAGNAN: Now what?
ATHOS: We need a distraction.

904
01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.304
-I'll go.
-I'll go.

905
01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:32.676
I could go.

906
01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:34.382
Probably not.

907
01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:35.474
Wrong.

908
01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:38.395
Wrong on all counts.
You’ll need every sword where you're going.

909
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.101
I can't help you there, but I can help.

910
01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:43.399
Right here, right now.

911
01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:44.734
-If they catch you...
-They won't.

912
01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:47.445
-If they catch you...
-I'm the Queen's lady-in-waiting.

913
01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:49.606
You, on the other hand,
are a wanted fugitive,

914
01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:52.735
and about to steal
from the most powerful man in England.

915
01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.411
Which one of us should be worried?

916
01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:56.946
Go.

917
01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.206
Go so that you can come back.

918
01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.420
Now give me that hat.

919
01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:21.100
D'Artagnan!

920
01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.306
Get after him!

921
01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:39.947
Wait!

922
01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:45.461
ATHOS: The diamonds will be
in Buckingham's personal vault,

923
01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:49.124
Located in the lowest, most secure level
of the Tower, next to the crown jewels.

924
01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.258
The lock is state of the art.

925
01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:54.133
It requires a key that Buckingham
carries on his person at all times.

926
01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.805
Corridor leading up to it is booby-trapped.

927
01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:57.382
Oh, I'm glad that's straightforward.

928
01:04:57.936 --> 01:05:00.723
Tempt anyone
with some bread and cheese, if you...

929
01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:03.221
You hadn't finished the briefing, actually.
I'm so sorry.

930
01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:05.022
Please don't tell me off.

931
01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.976
ATHOS: Then it gets worse, a lot worse.

932
01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:10.941
We have to cross three stone walls
and a moat.

933
01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:13.064
And there's just a couple of hundred
highly trained soldiers

934
01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.649
with a predilection for not being robbed.

935
01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:18.494
Although, since Buckingham undoubtedly
knows we' re coming, thanks to Milady,

936
01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:20.079
that number is likely to be greater.

937
01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.999
D'ARTAGNAN: And why can't we just tell
Buckingham Milady is plotting against him?

938
01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:27.170
ATHOS: Because he wouldn't believe us.
Why should he? We're his sworn enemies.

939
01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:30.756
Besides, Milady would have made sure.

940
01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:33.760
Athos is coming.

941
01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:36.425
T ell me.

942
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.016
What do you suppose he's after?

943
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.885
What does it matter?

944
01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:47.603
Whatever it is, it's merely an excuse.
He wants revenge for Venice.

945
01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:50.727
He wants me.

946
01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:53.438
And he wants you.

947
01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.402
We shall have to be ready for him.

948
01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:00.866
Won't we?

949
01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:05.867
We can't outshoot them,
but we can outsmart them.

950
01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:08.791
He’ll naturally favor
misdirection and deception.

951
01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:12.791
He knows we're expecting him,
but that just ups the ante.

952
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:14.880
She knows us.

953
01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:18.388
What we look like, how we move,
how we think.

954
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.882
He’ll divide his forces, independent teams,

955
01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:24.094
each with their own point of entry
to maximize their chances.

956
01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:26.271
There are four of us. So we use...

957
01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:29.190
Well, there's five of us, actually, if you...

958
01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:35.188
He's a skilled diver. He’ll take the aquatic
route, through the Traitor's Gate.

959
01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:42.412
Aramis will undoubtedly rely
on agility and stealth.

960
01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:45.873
Check every tower, every rooftop.

961
01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:52.418
Porthos, on the other hand,
will employ brute strength.

962
01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:56.258
One of his preferred methods
is getting captured by the opposition.

963
01:07:01.226 --> 01:07:04.468
All the more reason
to take none of them alive.

964
01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.179
One more thing.

965
01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:14.520
They may try and drive a wedge between us.

966
01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.525
Claim to have secret information

967
01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:19.198
about some plot to get us
to turn against one another,

968
01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:23.654
like, say, I'm a double agent
working for the Cardinal

969
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:27.248
or you're looking to get rid of me.

970
01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:34.631
I assure you,
nothing could be further from the truth.

971
01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:38.259
-(GASPS)
-Although,

972
01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:44.011
I suppose I should

973
01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:48.595
search you for concealed weapons.

974
01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:52.894
That's how it's done.

975
01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:56.903
And that's exactly what she’ll expect.

976
01:07:57.115 --> 01:08:00.403
So we do the unexpected.

977
01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:04.911
We go in broad daylight.
One man, hiding in plain sight.

978
01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:08.536
With all the extra security, there’ll be
a lot of new faces, that's their weakness.

979
01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:11.834
And you, D'Artagnan, you're the wild card.

980
01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:15.463
We are the decoys.

981
01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:19.255
Now we’ll try and create a distraction,
keep them occupied,

982
01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.256
keep them away from you
as much as possible,

983
01:08:21.347 --> 01:08:23.554
but, ultimately, it's down to you.

984
01:08:24.851 --> 01:08:26.762
You wanted to be a Musketeer?

985
01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.593
You want to serve France?

986
01:08:29.355 --> 01:08:30.640
This is your chance.

987
01:08:38.489 --> 01:08:41.481
COMMANDER: Left, Right, Left, Right, Left!

988
01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:42.948
I thought you saw the signal!

989
01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:46.119
-I saw you waving like an idiot!
-Well, that was the bloody signal!

990
01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:47.945
I'm trying to see things
from your point of view,

991
01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:50.498
but, unfortunately,
I can't get my head that far up my ass!

992
01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:52.041
-Up your ass? I'll tell you what...
-Yes!

993
01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:53.413
SERGEANT: That's enough of that!

994
01:08:54.922 --> 01:08:57.413
PORTHOS: Finally, good,
at last, a peace officer!

995
01:08:57.550 --> 01:09:00.462
Now listen, Sergeant,
I would like you to arrest this man!

996
01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:01.542
Arrest me?

997
01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:02.923
You can't arrest me!

998
01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:05.346
Don't you tell me that!
I've lost my prized bantam!

999
01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:08.425
-Bantams? They are rotten!
-They are not rotten!

1000
01:09:32.168 --> 01:09:35.501
Sir! The first of the Musketeers
has been arrested!

1001
01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:37.912
The game is afoot.

1002
01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:42.092
Bring him to me and double the guards.
Double the troops.

1003
01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:45.006
Double everything.

1004
01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:46.671
Sir!

1005
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.511
They’ll come to us.

1006
01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:52.768
Well, then.

1007
01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.638
I think Your Lordship
has everything under control.

1008
01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:59.101
You won't mind if I don't stay
to see how it all turns out?

1009
01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:03.571
-Do you think I might lose?
-On the contrary.

1010
01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:06.400
I have no issues with you killing Athos,

1011
01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.951
but, if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not watch him die.

1012
01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:15.412
Tell me, what's your favorite color?

1013
01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:22.961
Red.

1014
01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:25.050
Why?

1015
01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:28.255
I wanted to see
if you were capable of telling the truth.

1016
01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:30.965
Hmm.

1017
01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:42.690
As far from here as possible.

1018
01:10:56.711 --> 01:10:58.326
Well, well, well.

1019
01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:03.794
Look at what the cat dragged in.

1020
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:07.552
So, how's the old Athos, eh?

1021
01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:12.511
Still his surly, insufferable self, I'm sure.

1022
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:16.143
Sending a boy to do a man's job.

1023
01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.937
I should feel insulted.

1024
01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:24.109
Well, what were you after anyway, eh?

1025
01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:29.566
Secrets, spies, it's all a game, really.

1026
01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:33.407
Although the price of loss,
as you’ll come to discover,

1027
01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.655
is a little bit higher.

1028
01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:38.832
What?

1029
01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.494
No last words?

1030
01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:43.834
No insults?

1031
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.666
-Pleas for mercy or...
-What time is it?

1032
01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:53.841
About 2:00, I'd say.
Why? Are you in a hurry?

1033
01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.682
Look out of the window.

1034
01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:08.855
They weren't the decoys. I was.

1035
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.269
Ahhh!

1036
01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:46.939
(GUN FIRE CONTINUING)

1037
01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:03.163
(MAN SCREAMING)

1038
01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:15.425
Permission to come aboard?

1039
01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:16.631
Granted.

1040
01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:20.059
(COUGHING)

1041
01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:21.469
(GRUNTS)

1042
01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:24.642
(PANTS)

1043
01:13:34.535 --> 01:13:36.150
Athos!

1044
01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:58.014
The wonderful thing about fighting
an imaginary opponent, Captain Rochefort,

1045
01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:01.680
is that he's always greatly skilled
yet easily defeated.

1046
01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:03.098
Eminence.

1047
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.477
The pride of victory without the risk of loss.

1048
01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:11.151
I trust you didn't come here to impress me
with your swordsmanship.

1049
01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:14.317
No, Your Eminence. I have some good news.

1050
01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:16.448
Such as?

1051
01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:35.126
So what about the diamonds?
Doesn't Buckingham still have them?

1052
01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:36.301
Nope.

1053
01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:38.637
Milady likes hedging her bets.

1054
01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:39.713
She'd never have taken the chance

1055
01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:41.390
we'd actually succeed
in breaking into the vault.

1056
01:14:43.104 --> 01:14:44.844
D'ARTAGNAN: So where are they now?

1057
01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:47.688
ATHOS: With the only person she trusts.

1058
01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:55.483
Which means we've lost her
and all this has been for nothing.

1059
01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:57.110
I wouldn’t say that.

1060
01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.789
You were the decoy, we were the extraction,

1061
01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:09.334
but the real linchpin of the plan, well,

1062
01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:12.170
that was someone else entirely.

1063
01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:17.960
Someone even Milady would never suspect.

1064
01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:25.267
Driver! What the hell is going on?

1065
01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:28.471
Just following your instructions, ma'am.
"As far away from here as possible."

1066
01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:29.931
(LAUGHING)

1067
01:15:58.137 --> 01:15:59.877
PLANCHET: Whoo-hoo!

1068
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:15.810
Planchet. Never thought
I'd hear myself say this, but

1069
01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:17.519
well done.

1070
01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:19.146
Thank you, sir.

1071
01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:21.778
That means a lot,
especially coming from you.

1072
01:16:21.869 --> 01:16:22.858
Shut up, Planchet.

1073
01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:24.152
Yes, sir.

1074
01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:32.660
-Don't.
-(CLICKS)

1075
01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:38.298
We took the precaution
of removing the gunpowder.

1076
01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:46.507
What now?

1077
01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:50.094
You give me the diamonds
or I take them off your corpse.

1078
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:51.520
Dealer’s choice.

1079
01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:57.439
-Anything else you'd like me to take off?
-Outside.

1080
01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:11.658
Boys.

1081
01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:13.910
Been a while.

1082
01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:19.044
This must be the young Gascon.

1083
01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:21.550
We've met before.

1084
01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:24.169
Ah, yes.

1085
01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:26.805
Small world.

1086
01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:30.850
I didn't let Rochefort kill you.

1087
01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:34.430
You do remember that, don't you?

1088
01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:37.729
(GUN COCKING)

1089
01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:44.403
-Did you kill Buckingham?
-No.

1090
01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:47.451
-But you will kill me?
-ATHOS: Yes.

1091
01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.247
You would spare him, but kill me?

1092
01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:55.167
Yes. I don't hate Buckingham.

1093
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:05.545
Here.

1094
01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:07.971
You may find use for this.

1095
01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:12.468
Move.

1096
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:47.465
Athos.

1097
01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:10.155
At least she died the way she lived,
on her own terms.

1098
01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:15.205
She did it for me.

1099
01:19:17.211 --> 01:19:21.454
I wouldn’t have been able to live
with myself had I pulled the trigger.

1100
01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:25.674
Come on, let's go home.

1101
01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:40.769
LADY: But I can't get it.

1102
01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.850
LADY 2: How marvelous!

1103
01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:47.188
Oh! So great!

1104
01:19:54.832 --> 01:19:56.697
-(CLEARING THROAT)
-Oh!

1105
01:19:58.502 --> 01:19:59.867
Your Majesty.

1106
01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.542
My dear.

1107
01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:03.704
You look troubled.

1108
01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:06.840
Hardly. Your Majesty just startled me.

1109
01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:09.084
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1110
01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:12.046
I just wanted to drop by

1111
01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.972
and tell you how much
I was looking forward to tonight.

1112
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:19.554
Should be quite spectacular, you know.
Costumes, fireworks and such.

1113
01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:21.767
But you,

1114
01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:25.856
you shall be
the most spectacular sight of all.

1115
01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:29.446
And especially since
you’ll wear the diamonds.

1116
01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:31.944
You will wear them, won't you?

1117
01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:35.991
Well, it's very important to me that you do.

1118
01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:40.366
Then I shall wear them, Your Majesty.

1119
01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.126
Until tonight, then.

1120
01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.755
She promised she’ll wear them.

1121
01:20:56.435 --> 01:20:58.266
You do think she’ll wear them,
don't you, Richelieu?

1122
01:20:59.021 --> 01:21:01.387
I'm sure she will, Your Majesty.

1123
01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:03.097
I'm sure she will.

1124
01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.418
(RETCHING)

1125
01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:33.127
I hate air travel!

1126
01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.299
(PLANCHET GROANING)

1127
01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:49.442
Damn!

1128
01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.676
HELMSMAN: Hard to starboard!

1129
01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:37.403
Well, now that we have their attention,

1130
01:22:37.494 --> 01:22:39.701
let's see if we can settle this
in a peaceful manner.

1131
01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:41.745
More or less.

1132
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:45.615
Ah, Gascon!

1133
01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:49.211
So you've traded up
when it comes to transport.

1134
01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:51.163
But, once again, you're outmatched.

1135
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.381
You can thank Milady for that.

1136
01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:56.336
She passed on Buckingham's plans
a long time ago.

1137
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:59.012
As you can see,
we made some improvements.

1138
01:22:59.892 --> 01:23:00.927
(CHUCKLES)

1139
01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:02.224
Isn't she a beauty?

1140
01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:03.679
What do you want?

1141
01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:07.019
The diamonds.

1142
01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:09.397
-Come and take them.
-ROCHEFORT: Gladly!

1143
01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:13.352
You see, I can blast you out of the sky
with total impunity.

1144
01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:14.778
If you fire on me, on the other hand,

1145
01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:16.981
you’ll be killing
Miss Oh-so-young-and-pretty.

1146
01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:22.406
You have 60 seconds.

1147
01:23:24.374 --> 01:23:26.160
He’ll shoot us down
the moment he has the diamonds.

1148
01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:27.286
We can't outrun them.

1149
01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:28.875
And we can't fight them, damn it! We can't.

1150
01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:31.248
-Oh, D'Artagnan.
-What?

1151
01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:34.381
Do you think
you have the monopoly on loss?

1152
01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:35.666
What if she dies?

1153
01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:37.297
The life of one woman
or the future of France,

1154
01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:39.294
what would you do
if you were in my position?

1155
01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:44.258
ATHOS: I've made a lot of sacrifices,
a lot of hard choices.

1156
01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:47.394
For honor, for King, for country.
You wanna know what I've learned, boy?

1157
01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:50.598
Hard choices and sacrifices
do not keep you warm at night.

1158
01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:55.027
Life is too damn short and too damn long
to go through without someone at your side.

1159
01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:56.774
Don't end up like me.

1160
01:23:57.658 --> 01:24:00.946
Choose the woman.
Fight for love, D'Artagnan.

1161
01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:03.778
France will take care of itself.

1162
01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:06.947
ROCHEFORT: Time's up!

1163
01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:11.622
An exchange.

1164
01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:16.040
I go aboard your ship with the diamonds,
the girl comes aboard ours.

1165
01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.254
Once I know she's safe,

1166
01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:20.802
I give them to you.

1167
01:24:20.973 --> 01:24:24.807
Fine. But I want to see the diamonds first.

1168
01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:26.721

1169
01:24:29.273 --> 01:24:30.809
Cut her loose.

JUSSAC: Deploy the gangway!
HELMSMAN: Deploy the gangway!

1171
01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:46.661
Satisfied?

1172
01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:34.535
You never learn, do you?

1173
01:25:41.845 --> 01:25:42.880

Good.

1178
01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:24.593
I really want you to see this.

1179
01:26:24.763 --> 01:26:26.048
Finish them off!

1180
01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:30.257
We can't outrun them
and we can't outgun them.

1181
01:26:30.394 --> 01:26:33.181
We could try asking them to surrender,
but somehow I don't think it would work.

1182
01:26:33.271 --> 01:26:35.102
We hide. In there.

to get you one of those, so...

Could keep us together
