[breath exhaling]

[flag rustling]

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.080
[fireworks crackling]

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.160
[thunder rumbling]

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.440
[thunder cracks]

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.320

[wood creaking]
[man grunting]

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.120
[man speaking Spanish]
<i>Capitan! Capitan!</i>

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.520
[grunts]

10
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.000
Who are you?

11
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.840
[horses panting]

12
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.400
[man shouts indistinctly]

13
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.120
[man shouting indistinctly]

14
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.960
What is this?

15
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.480
Your Majesty, caught him
up in a fishing net.
A fishing net.

16
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.120
Sire, he's been telling
stories. Stories that...
We believe he's found a...

17
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.280
Ponce de Leon.

18
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.880
Says he found
Ponce de Leon's ship.

19
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.800
[man 2] Or sailed on it.
[man 1] No, I told you,

20
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.640
Ponce de Leon
died 200 years ago.

21
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.040
Aye, but he died searching
for something, didn't he?

22
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.160
The Fountain of Youth.

23
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.040
How soon can you sail?

24
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.640
With the tide.

25
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.160
[woman] Over here!
Lucky heather!

26
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.040
[man] Pirate swords!
Pirate swords!

27
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.320
Pirate's execution today.
Watch him swing!

28
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.680
[man] Pirate puppets!

29
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.000
Take that, you!
[girl] Hurry, Papa,
or we'll miss the hanging!

30
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.760
It's not a hanging, dear,
it's a trial. The hanging
comes this afternoon.

31
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.680
[man] Pirate hanging today!

32
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.320
[door creaks]
Come on. Up you get.

33
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.680
Move along, pirate.

34
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.920
Or should I say,
"Captain Pirate"? [laughs]

35
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.920
Come on. Come on! Up you go.

36
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.200
[crowd shouting]
[man] Quiet! Order!

37
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.640
[pounding gavel]
[man] Quiet!

38
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.360
Now appearing
before the court,

39
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.240
the notorious and infamous
pirate, pillager,

40
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.520
and highwayman...
Quiet!

41
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.640
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

42
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.360
[crowd jeering]

43
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.320
I told you, the name's Gibbs!
Joshamee Gibbs!

44
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.880
How many times...
[man] Hear ye, hear ye!
Presiding over these trials,

45
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.480
all rise and attend, the
Right Honorable Justice Smith!

46
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.680
[crowd shouting]

47
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.800
My dear sir.

48
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.640
Quiet!
[pounding gavel]

49
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.960
Now...

50
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.600
...what do we have here?

51
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.320
Jack?

52
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.920
Shut up!
[grunts]

53
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
[crowd chattering]
I don't recognize him.

54
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.360
Not necessary.
You were saying?

55
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.720
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

56
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.120
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.
[crowd shouting]

57
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.880
Is that so?

58
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.000
It says Jack Sparrow here.
[Gibbs] I told 'em.

59
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.440
I'm not Jack Sparrow,
who I would be happy
to identify to the court

60
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.640
if it would help my case.
I think that would
be a poor defense,

61
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.320
unless you want
to be bludgeoned again
like a harp seal.

62
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.760
[crowd shouting]
[Jack] The prisoner
claims of being innocent

63
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.120
to being Jack Sparrow.
How do you find?

64
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.120
No trial? But aren't we here
to examine the evidence...

65
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.800
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

66
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.480
Guilty verdict
means he'll hang.

67
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.480
[crowd cheering]
Hang him! String him up!

68
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.240
[crowd quiets]

69
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.840
Guilty?
That's not fair!

70
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.680
[crowd cheering]
Shut it.

71
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.000
[pounds gavel]

72
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.040
Joshamee Gibbs,
the crime of which

73
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.640
you've been found guilty of

74
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.240
is being innocent
of being Jack Sparrow.

75
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.600
I hereby
commute your sentence,

76
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.320
and order
that you be imprisoned
for the remainder

77
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.080
of your miserable, moribund,
mutton-chopped life.

78
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.720
What?!
Hang him!

79
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.120
[woman] Hang him!
There.

80
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.280
Balderdash!
String him up!
Hang him high!

81
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.280
[clamoring]

82
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.200
Means shall be arranged
to transport this prisoner

83
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.560
to the Tower of London.

84
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.560
[muffled shouting]

85
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.960
Thanks very much.

86
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.800
Ta.

87
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.080
Come on. Get up there.

88
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.000
Get up!

89
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.520
Hell's teeth. Now we're
both headed for prison.

90
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.600
Not to worry.
I've paid off the driver.

91
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.960
Ten minutes, we'll be outside
London Town, horses waiting.

92
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.520
Tonight, we make the coast.

93
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.440
Then it's just a matter
of finding a ship.

94
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.840
[Gibbs] All part
of the plan, yes?
[Jack] Exactly.

95
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.920
I arrived in London Town
just this morning

96
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.520
to rescue one
Joshamee Gibbs

97
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.360
from one appointment
with the gallows.

98
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.160
Seeing as how
you're still alive,

99
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.240
I'd say it's all been
very successful thus far.

100
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.320
What happened
to you, Gibbs?

101
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.200
I thought you were
employed elsewhere
or otherwise engaged.

102
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.880
Aye. But I always listened
like a thief for news
of the <i>Black Pearl.</i>

103
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.160
Nobody's seen where
she might next make port.

104
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.240
Then, I hear a rumor:

105
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.920
Jack Sparrow's in London
with a ship and looking
for a crew.

106
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.680
Am not.
But that's what I heard.

107
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.360
Fact is, you're
signing up men tonight.

108
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.920
Pub called
The Captain's Daughter.

109
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.440
Am not!
Well, I thought it
a bit odd,

110
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.080
but then, you've never
been the most predictable
of sorts.

111
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.360
Tell me something.
There is another

112
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.920
Jack Sparrow out there
sullying my good name?

113
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.280
An impostor.
Indeed.

114
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.040
But... an impostor
with a ship.

115
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.240
And in need of a crew.

116
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.880
Which, as fate
would have it, so am I.

117
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.320
What about you, Jack?

118
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.480
Last I heard
you were hell-bent

119
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.680
to find
the Fountain of Youth.

120
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.200
Any luck?

121
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.440
Circumstances arose
and forced
a compelling insight

122
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.480
regarding discretion
and valor.

123
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.560
Meaning, you gave up.
I did not.

124
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.680
I am just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.

125
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.520
I shall taste those waters,
Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

126
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.680
Oh. Short trip.
[chuckles]

127
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.480
All part
of the plan, yes?

128
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.040
[grunts] No.

129
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.800
[door closes, locks]

130
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.400
[footsteps receding]

131
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.360
[horses trotting, neighing]

132
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.240
[distant chattering]

133
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.000
[distant banging]

134
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.680
[grunts]

135
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.680
[marching footsteps approach]

136
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.040
You are Jack Sparrow?

137
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.840
There should be a "Captain"
in there somewhere.

138
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.800
I've heard of you.

139
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.640
And you know who I am.

140
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.240
Face is familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

141
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.920
You are in the presence
of George Augustus,
Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg,

142
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.160
Archtreasurer
and Prince-elector
of the Holy Roman Empire,

143
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.640
King of Great Britain
and Ireland, and of you.

144
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.360
Doesn't ring a bell.
I am informed

145
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.120
you have come to London
to procure a crew
for your ship.

146
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.480
Vicious rumor. Not true.

147
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.680
Then you lied to me when you
told me you were Jack Sparrow.

148
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.000
I am Jack Sparrow, but I'm
not here to procure a crew.

149
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.440
That is... someone else.

150
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.800
Ah. Someone else
named Jack Sparrow.

151
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.160
You've brought me
the wrong wastrel.

152
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.600
Find the proper one
and dispose of this impostor.

153
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.680
No, wait, wait.
Hang on a minute.

154
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.200
I'm Jack Sparrow,
the one and only.

155
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.760
And I am in London.

156
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.520
To procure a crew.
[chains clanking loudly]

157
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.320
To undertake a voyage
to the Fountain...
What?

158
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.320
Will someone please remove
these infernal chains?

159
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.840
[sighs] Come, come.
[chains clanking]

160
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.840
We know you're
in possession of a map.

161
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.200
So confiscate the map,
and to the gallows with him!

162
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.000
Have you a map?

163
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.600
No.
Where is it?

164
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.920
The truth? I lost it.

165
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.240
Quite recently, in fact.
I have a report.

166
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.080
The Spanish have located
the Fountain of Youth.

167
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:18.240
I will not have some
melancholy Spanish monarch,

168
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.080
a Catholic,
gain eternal life!

169
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.000
[silverware clattering]

170
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.760
You do know the way
to the Fountain?

171
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.040
Of course I do.
Look at me.

172
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.920
You could guide
an expedition.

173
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
With your permission,
your heinie,

174
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.120
you will be providing,
then, a ship...

175
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.520
...and a crew?

176
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.360
And a captain.

177
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.200
Afternoon, sire.

178
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.120
If I may be so bold,
why is that man not
in chains?

179
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.400
He must be
manacled at once.

180
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.040
At the center
of my palace? Hardly.

181
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.840
Hector.

182
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.880
How nice to see
a fellow pirate
make good of himself.

183
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.880
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

184
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:29.120
On a sanctioned mission
under the authority and
protection of the Crown.

185
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.640
As may be, but first,

186
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.120
what has become of
my beloved <i>Pearl?</i>

187
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.360
I lost the <i>Pearl</i>
as I lost my leg.

188
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.800
Lost the <i>Pearl?</i>
Aye.

189
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.720
I defended
her mightily enough,
but she be sunk nonetheless.

190
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.960
If that ship
be sunk properly,
you should be sunk with it.

191
00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.680
Captain Barbossa,
each second we tarry,
the Spanish outdistance us.

192
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.400
I have every confidence
you will prevail
and be rewarded

193
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.440
with the high station
you so desire.

194
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.240
To serve doth suffice, sire.
You, sir, have stooped.

195
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.600
Jack, our sands
be all but run.

196
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.920
Where's the harm in
joining the winning side?

197
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.840
And you do meet
a nicer class of person.

198
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.120
I understand everything.

199
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.320
Except that wig.

200
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.400
[man] He's getting away!
Stop him!

201
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.840
[man 2] Head him off!
[man 3] No!
Stop that pirate!

203
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.040
Come down!

204
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.200
He escaped?
Leave it to me, sire.

205
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.680

208
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.440
Find him!

[whistle trilling]

210
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.320

Is that it?

218
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.800
Oh!

219
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.520
[man] Halt!
Stop that carriage!

220
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.800
[man 2] Head him off!

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.800
[soldiers shouting

Whoa! He's getting away!
After him! Stop him!

234
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.200
After him!

Hello, Jackie.

Hello, Dad.

243
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.280
Whoo! [laughs]
[up-tempo music plays]

[snoring]
[laughter]

245
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.400
[Teague] I heard you're
putting together a crew.

246
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.520
If enough people keep
saying it, it must be true.

247
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.440
I heard where you're headed.
The Fountain.

248
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.960
Have you been there?

249
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.120
Does this face look like it's been
to the Fountain of Youth?

250
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.760
Depends on the light.
Son, the Fountain.

251
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.680
There'll be items required
for the profane ritual.

252
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.560
Two chalices.

253
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.880
On the map
there was a chalice.

254
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.680
Two, silver.

255
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.800
From the Ponce de Leon ship.
You'll need both.

256
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.560
For?
The ritual.
Don't be a fool, Jackie.

257
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.680
Find out every detail
before you set sail.

258
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.640
Oh, set sail. Love to.

259
00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.160
But for that,
I may need a ship.

260
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.560
Those folk, over there,
they have a ship.

261
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.880
They're signing up
sailors right now.

And one
last thing, Jackie.

265
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.360
The Fountain will test you.
Mark my words.

Aye. That is,

273
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.040
Jack Sparrow be putting
together a modest venture.

274

You got some nerve,
ain't ya?

275
00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.720
Turning up here
dressed like that?

276
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.640
What are you,
some kind of impostor?

277
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720
Have you any idea
who I am, mate?

Oi, muckers!

[man] Lads,
I'm sailing with Sparrow.

[man] Who's next?

286
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.480
[man] Bring us
some more of those ones.

287
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.880
Yeah, make it four.

288
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.880
You've stolen me, and I'm
here to take meself back.

289
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.080
Stop doing that.

297
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.560
Always wanted to do that.

Hello, Angelica.

Hello, Jack.
Are you impressed?

301
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.400
I think I almost killed you
once or twice there.

302
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.160
I'm touched at this most
sincerest form of flattery.

303
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.920
But why?

304
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.440
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.

305
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.360
That is not a compliment.

[buttons clattering]

307
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.080
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you
a long time ago.

308
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.680
For what? For leaving you?
Recall that I left you.

309
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.200
A gentleman allows a lady
to maintain her fictions.

310
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.040
Look, Sparrow. As long as
my sailors get their money,

311
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.240
they're willing
to put up with any number
of peculiarities.

312
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.320
Ah. There is
one peculiarity

313
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.360
with which I will
not put up with.

314
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.800
I will be impersonated
as "Captain." Nothing less.

315
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.840
Well, for that,
you need a ship,

316
00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.440
and as it turns out,
I have one.

317
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.720
I could use a ship.

318
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.800
I hear tell you've
been to the Fountain.

319
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.640
There be a lot
of hear-telling
going on these days.

The Fountain of Youth.
Dearest Angelica, fret not.

321
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.080
You still have
a few usable years left.

Always so charming.

323
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.120
You didn't answer me.
Eh?

324
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.560
Aye. Regarding the Fountain.
Waste of time, really...

325

slighted some king or other.

[man] Open it!

332

Yeah, you haven't changed.
Implying the need?

333
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.360
Yes.

334

[man] Open this door,
in the name of His Majesty.

335
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.720
You betrayed me.
You seduced me
and you used me.

336
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.840
I was innocent
of the ways of men.

337
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.200
You demonstrated a lot
of technique for someone
I supposedly corrupted.

338
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.920
Imminent danger.
Here, now, milady!

339
00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.960
[man] Open it!

340
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.600
I was ready to take my vows.
And you...

341
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.400
What were you doing in
a Spanish convent, anyway?

342
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.800
Mistook it for a brothel.
Honest mistake.

343
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.200
[pounding]
[men shouting]

344
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.880
There he is!
Over there!

[indistinct shouting]

347
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.760
We are at a disadvantage.

348
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.400
Speak for yourself.
Unlike some who pretend
to be,

349
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.800
but cannot, in fact,
hold a candle to,

350
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.760
I am
Captain Jack Sparrow.

351
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.920
[gasping]

352
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.640
How can you say
I used you?

353
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.280
You know exactly how.

354
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.440
I know, but how
can you say it?

355
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.960
[growls]

356
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.920
[distant buoy bell clanging]

357
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.080
[Angelica] So, what is it?
[Jack] What is what?

358
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.240
About the Fountain.

359
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.280
What do you know?

360
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.560
You don't happen
to be in possession

361
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.960
of two silver chalices,
circa Ponce de Leon?

362
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.480
No.
Ha. Thought not.

363
00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.200
Why?
I hear stories.

364
00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.680
Rumors.

365
00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.520
You are, of course,
aware of the ritual.

366
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.520
Yes, I am.

367
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.440
Hmm.

368
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.440
What is it?
What is required?

369
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.600
[projectile whizzes]
[grunts]

370
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.720
Hmm?

371
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.240
A mermaid, Jack.

372
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.880
[dog barking]

373
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.440
[Gibbs]
There's been a mistake.

374
00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.000
It's a life sentence,
not death. Life!

375
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.800
Barbossa.
Thank you, gentlemen.

376
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.920
I trust
you can tie a noose.

377
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.400
That's a hard thing,

378
00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.280
forcing a man to twist
his own hanging rope.

379
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.560
You must lie in your bed
the way you made it.

380
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.680
What's happened to you?

381
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.400
Where be Jack Sparrow?
He escaped. [chuckles]

382
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.200
I'm on a tight
schedule, Gibbs.

383
00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.480
The <i>HMS Providence</i>
sets sail at first light,

384
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.080
and if you do not care
to watch it,
hanging here dead,

385
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.240
with a mouth full of flies...

386
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.120
...speak now.

387
00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.440
Take me with you.
Any point of the compass...

388
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.440
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain? Aye?

389
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.080
Is that where
Jack be headed?

390
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.800
Have you anything
you can offer me, Gibbs?

391
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.320
Anything at all?

392
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.560
Upon me naked word,
you'll not see the dawn.

393
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.360
[rope creaking]

394
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.360
Hand it over.

395
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.520
You fool!
I had just enough time

396
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.120
to study those
infernal circles.

397
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.400
Every route,
every destination.
All safe... in here.

398
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.760
Welcome back
to His Majesty's navy,

399
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.320
Master Gibbs.

400
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.320
[waves crashing]
[wood creaking]

401
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.760
[snoring]

402
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.920
[grunts]
[man] Show a leg, sailor!

403
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.680
Aye, sir.

404
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.320
What?

405
00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.720
[chickens clucking]
There's been
a horrible mistake.

406
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.280
Keep moving.
[men shouting]

407
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.440
I'm not supposed to be here.
Many a man's woken up
at sea,

408
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.800
no idea what, when,
wherefore or why.

409
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.800
No memory of the night afore,
whence he signed up

410
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.680
and drank away
all his bonus money.

411
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.560
No, no, no.
You don't understand, mate.

412
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.280
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.

413
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.400
Scrum, and the pleasure's
all mine. Now, keep moving.

414
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.240
[distant chattering]

415
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.880
Scrum.

416
00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.920
[man] Get your elbows in!

417
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.800
Why is there a glass coffin?

418
00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.280
Do I look like
a man in charge?

419
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.360
Where am I?
'Scuse me,
Captain Sparrow, sir.

420
00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.360
I be right honored
to welcome you aboard our

421
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.960
world-renowned
vessel of infamy,
<i>Queen Anne's Revenge.</i>

422
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.480
Blackbeard.

423
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.080
[indistinct shouting]

424
00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.360
Work!
[screams]

425
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.440
[Jack] He's a curious one.
[Scrum] He's been
zombiefied.

426
00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.080
Eh?
Zombiefied.

427
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.720
Blackbeard's doing.
All the officers
are the same.

428
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.960
Makes 'em more compliant.
[shouts]

429
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.960
And perpetually ill-tempered.

430
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.960
Come on. Scrub.
Yeah.

431
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.960
[crew chanting]
Pull! Pull! Pull!

432
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.720
[grunting]

433
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.920
[Jack] Five days underway,
at least.

434
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.640
Aye. You can tell that
by the smell of the sea?

435
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.880
Smell of the crew.

436
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.680
[seagulls crying]
[Jack] Oi. What did
that poor sod do?

437
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.640
And how can I
make sure to not?

438
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.000
Him? Churchly fellow.

439
00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.480
Always going on about
the Lord Almighty.

440
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.240
Bible-thumper on this ship?

441
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.160
A missionary
is his story.

442
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.760
What I heard was
he got captured in a raid.

443
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.960
Rest of the ship
got killed, but not 'im.

444
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.720
First mate
wouldn't let it happen

445
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.640
on account of his premier
standing with the Lord.

446
00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.640
A first mate sticking her
neck out for some prisoner.

447
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.680
That you don't see.

448
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.520
"Her"?
First mate is a "her"?

449
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.440
[man] Back to work!

450
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.880
Steady as she goes.

451
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.680
[gasps]
[blade unsheathes]

452
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.320
You are a ruthless,
soulless, cross-grained cur.

453
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.160
I told you I had a ship.
No, Blackbeard has a ship,

454
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.520
upon which I am
now imprisoned.

455
00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.840
We can do this, Jack.

456
00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.040
The Fountain of Youth,
like you always wanted.

457
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:42.200
Blackbeard. Edward Teach.
The pirate all pirates fear.

458
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.280
Resurrector of the dead
in his spare time.

459
00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.240
He will listen to me.
He listens to no one.

460
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.960
Maybe to his own daughter?

461
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.640
Daughter as in... beget by?

462
00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.080
Long-lost.
Recently found.

463
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.760
Who loves her dear papa
with all her soul.

464
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.560
He bought that?
I sold that.

465
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.720
[footsteps approaching]

466
00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.760
Then it's the Fountain
of Youth for him,

467
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.560
or him and you,
not you and me.

468
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.120
No, Jack,
that's the best part.

469
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.960
He will be dead.
Ah.

470
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:28.040
You'll be handling
that part yourself, then?

471
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.840
There is a prophecy.

472
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.720
Maybe you don't believe
in the supernatural.

473
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.200
Oh, no, no.
I've seen a thing or two.

474
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.240
The prophecy is this:

475
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.680
Blackbeard will
meet his death within
a fortnight

476
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.720
at the hands
of a one-legged man.

477
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.680
That's why he needs
the Fountain, Jack.

478
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.560
[Barbossa] Oh, Master Gibbs,
short we are a map.

479
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.000
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to provide us an heading.

480
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.880
Be a gem
and pour me a gulper.

481
00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.240
Nay. We be privateers,
not pirates, Master Gibbs.

482
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.840
And in the king's name,
we behave as such.

483
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.600
Aye, Captain.

484
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.640
Be we on the
proper course, Gibbs?

485
00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.960
Aye, it be proper.

486
00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.560
There's your proof.

487
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.440
The Spaniard.

488
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:53.840
All hands! Battle stations!
Get to windward!

489
00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.640
[man] All hands, windward!
Harden up two points!

490
00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.520
[man] Two points!
Cast loose the cannons!

491
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.080
Gunners, take posts!
[man] Take position!
Gunners ready, sir!

492
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.240
Out! Thrust!
Await orders.

493
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.720
[man] Steady!

494
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.680
Guns armed,
awaiting orders, sir.

495
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.000
Sir. Orders, sir?

496
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.040
He never so much
as turned his head.

497
00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.480
The Fountain is the prize.

498
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.240
It appears we be not
even worth the time
it'd take to sink us.

499
00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.280
And now we've fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail!

500
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.600
All hands more sail!

501
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.960
Ride hard between
wind and tide!

502
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.440
The topic, gentlemen,
is mutiny.

503
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.520
Mutiny most foul.

504
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.280
Aye. I signed up to sail
under Jack Sparrow,
not some pretender.

505
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.080
And a lady, at that.
And mention was failed to
be made of this uncanny crew.

506
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.960
Make my toes curl, they do.

507
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.560
[swords rattling]
I got 'em. All of 'em.

508
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.480
[Jack] Well done.
Good lad.

509
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.000
On to it, then.
Blackbeard.

510
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.000
What are his habits?
Stays mostly to his cabin.

511
00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.480
That's right,
mostly to his cabin.

512
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.920
Yes, but when
he comes out...
He don't really come out.

513
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.600
[all muttering]
He must come out sometime.

514
00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.920
Not really, no.
[all muttering]

515
00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.240
Any of you
sail with him before?

516
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.600
No, no. Definitely not.
I've never.

517
00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.840
Any of you seen him before?
Not really, no.

518
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.760
Stays to his cabin,
no one sailed with him,

519
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.240
no one's seen him...

520
00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.400
Good news, gentlemen.
This is not
Blackbeard's ship.

521
00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.560
This is not the
<i>Queen Anne's Revenge.</i>

522
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.520
No, this be the
<i>Queen Anne's Revenge,</i>
right enough.

523
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.880
How do you know?

524
00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.760
I've seen the name,
on the back of the ship.

525
00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:20.040
[Jack] Gentlemen, sirs,
fellow conscriptees...

526
00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.360
...you have been
monstrously deceived.

527
00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.760
We are decepted, then?
Yes.

528
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.240
You've nay been informed
of a destination.

529
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.800
Death lies before us

530
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.800
as we sail for the
Fountain of Youth.

531
00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.520
[all muttering]
[Jack] It would be
a sorry plight, mates.

532
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.240
Death, for certain.
The garden of
darkened souls.

533
00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.160
Untimely our ends will be.
Unless...

534
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.240
...we take the ship.

535
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.840
We take the ship, then. Now!

536
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.600
[clattering]

537
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.400
Go on, then.
[all yelling]

538
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.840
Help me, shipmates!
Give it to 'em!

539
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.000
Wake up! It's ours!
Come on!

540
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.400
Get up! Off your backside!
[indistinct shouting]

541
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.920
Get off your fannies!
Take it to them, lads!

542
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.320
Help me! Fight!

543
00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.560
Mmm... Jack.

544
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.720
If this is a dream, you can
keep the sword and boots on.

545
00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.680
If it's not...
It's a dream.

546
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.160
[clamoring]

547
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.440
No, it's not!

548
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.040
I thought I should
give you fair warning,

549
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.040
we're taking the ship.
[speaks Spanish]

550
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.640
Nothing personal.
[speaking Spanish]

551
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.440
Think you might be
better off if you just...

552
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.640
[Angelica] Yah!
...stay out of it.

553
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.160
[all yelling]

554
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.960
[grunting]

555
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.800
[growls]

556
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.560
[roaring]
Boggit.

557
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.440
[yells]

558
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.400
[yells]

559
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.480
[man] Wretch!

560
00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.640
[yells]

561
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.520
[shouts]

562
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.240
You're either with us
or against us!

563
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.560
I am not with you,
neither am I against you!

564
00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.080
Can he do that?

565
00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.760
He's religious.
I believe it's required.

566
00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.960
[gasps, panting]

567
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.440
Fight to the bitter end,
you cack-handed deck apes!

568
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.960
Take him, men.
Tie him down tight!

569
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.600
[grunting]

570
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.920
The ship is ours!

571
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.800
[sighs]
[wind whistling]

572
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.000
Gentlemen.

573
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.200
I be placed
in a bewilderment.

574
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.640
There I were, resting,

575
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.040
and upon a sudden, I hear
an ungodly row on deck.

576
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.200
[sword vibrates]

577
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.520
Sailors abandon their posts

578
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.920
without orders,
without leave.

579
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.560
Men before the mast,

580
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.560
taking the ship
for themselves.

581
00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.760
What be that, First Mate?

582
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.680
Mutiny, Captain.
Again?

583
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.320
[Angelica] Mutiny!
Aye.

584
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.760
Mutiny.

585
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.120
And what fate
befalls mutineers?

586
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.520
Now, we know the answer
to that, do we not?

587
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.920
Mutineers hang!

588
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.280
[all shouting]

589
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.240
[shouting]

590
00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.400
[yells]

591
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.360
Whoa!

592
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Captain, I wish
to report a mutiny.

593
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.000
I can name fingers
and point names.

594
00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.880
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

595
00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.800
They are sheep.
You, their shepherd.

596
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.680
Have I mentioned, sir,
what a lovely daughter
you have?

597
00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.000
A fitting last sight
for a doomed soul.
Remember, Father.

598
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.880
We need him.
If I don't kill
a man every now and then,

599
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.360
they forget who I am.
[man] Coward!

600
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.880
Hmm?
They do not forget.

601
00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.320
Your crew sees you
for the miscreant you are.

602
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.320
A coward, no matter
how many you slay.

603
00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.800
Twice in one day, I find
myself in a bewilderment.

604
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.880
You are not bewildered,
you are afraid.

605
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.160
You dare not walk the path
of righteousness,
the way of the light.

606
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.680
No, sir. The truth is it
be much simpler than all that.

607
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.320
I am a bad man.

608
00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.640
That, too.

609
00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.760
I might have to kill
you too, catechist.

610
00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.520
No!
All Latin blood
like her mother.

611
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.360
Father, I beg you.

612
00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:30.280
Ah, there I be again,
forgetting why the
missionary is here.

613
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:34.880
My daughter
fears for my soul,
or what's left of it.

614
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.160
You truly wish to save me,
my child?

615
00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.880
Every soul can be saved.

616
00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.760
Be that true, young cleric?

617
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.560
Yes. Though you I see
as a bit of a long shot.

618
00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.000
Still, I pray for
every unfortunate soul

619
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.600
on this hell-bound vessel.

620
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.720
You disarm me
with your faith.

621
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.400
Eight bells!

622
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.800
Which of you unfortunate
souls stood watch?

623
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.640
I did. I stood watch.
[chuckles] Gunner.

624
00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.280
You?

625
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.440
Aye.
[breathes heavily]

626
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.320
[Blackbeard] Aye.

627
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.320
The cook. Perfect.
Lower the longboat!

628
00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.320
Bring her about!

629
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.320
[ship groans]

630
00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.320
Why do you do this?
Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

631
00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.760
Our laws allow the Captain
to show leniency.

632
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.480
I have given this man
a chance to determine
his fate,

633
00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.200
a gift not afforded to all.

634
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.960
Oh, you now.

635
00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.080
Chance to show the worth
of your prayers.

636
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:13.880
Pray he be delivered
from... evil?

637
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.560
Course made!
Stop. Give that man
a chance. Give yourself a...

638
00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.560
[screams]

639
00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.480
You know when I feel
closest to our Maker?

640
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.000
When I see suffering,
pain and anguish.

641
00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.680
That's when the true design
of this world is revealed.

642
00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.480
And I see it revealed
when in times of hardship
and tragedy,

643
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.920
kindness and compassion
are shown to those in need.

644
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.480
Perhaps you should pray
for him to be unharmed, yes?

645
00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.640
Please, there's
still hope...
Again!

646
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.880
I actually have no interest
in the Fountain whatsoever,

647
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.560
so, if your heart is set,

648
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.480
you may drop me off
anywhere you like.

649
00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.240
That'll be all, Quartermaster.

650
00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:37.320
Your words surround you like
fog and make you hard to see.

651
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.280
And what of you,
the mighty Blackbeard?

652
00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.680
Beheaded they say.
Still, your body swam

653
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.920
three times around your ship,
then climbed back on board.

654
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
And here you are,
running scared.

655
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.000
Scared.

656
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.200
To the Fountain.

657
00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.120
[Blackbeard]
The Quartermaster sees
things before they happen.

658
00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:02.440
He has
foreseen my death, and so
the fates have spoken.

659
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.040
The threads
of destiny woven.

660
00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.240
[Jack] You have a ridiculously
high regard for fate, mate.

661
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.280
And you?
Me?

662
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.520
I'm skeptical
of predicting any future...
which includes me.

663
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:20.800
It'd be foolish
to battle fate, but I'd be
tempted to cheat it.

664
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.440
I will reach the Fountain.
You will lead me.

665
00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.800
That knife will
serve you no better

666
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.800
than the mutiny
you devised.

667
00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.880
Mutiny served me well.

668
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.960
It gained me
an audience with you.

669
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.040
Oh?
Aye.

670
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.640
To warn you.

671
00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:42.960
Regarding your first mate,

672
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.560
who pretends to be persons
she is not.

673
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.600
Do tell.

674
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.080
She is not your daughter.

675
00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.200
[Blackbeard] You dare
to speak thusly
of my flesh and blood?

676
00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:03.000
[Jack] Sir, the woman
is consummate in
the art of deception.

677
00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:07.720
I know.
As I mostly unwittingly
set her on her wicked path.

678
00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.200
Though I cannot
claim credit

679
00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.000
for her existing abundance
of natural talent.

680
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.440
Angelica. [inhales]
My beloved daughter,

681
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.920
the one true good thing
I have done in this life,

682
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.840
and you claim to be the one
who corrupted her?

683
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.000
Sir, what she is
is pure evil.

684
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.600
More to be feared
than a wild beast.

685
00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.560
Hungry wild beast
with gnashing teeth.

686
00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.280
Vengeful, hungry
from hell beast...

687
00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.960
Father?
Sweetness!

688
00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.520
[groans]
[Angelica] No need
to hurt him, Father.

689
00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.960
He will help us.
Won't you, Jack?

690
00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.360
You see? Even now,
she attends to your welfare,

691
00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.160
giving lie to the claims
you make of her.

692
00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.080
[grunts]

693
00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:04.520
You will lead us
to the Fountain. Yes?

694
00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.000
[Blackbeard]
Put another way.

695
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:11.680
If I do not make it
to the Fountain in time...

696
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.840
...neither will you.
[fire sizzling]

697
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.720
I'll have a wee look-see
at those charts

698
00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.800
straight away then, shall I?

699
00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.960
Sir.

700
00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.320
Aye?
Captain, sir,

701
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.640
I am unhappy to
report rumors, sir,

702
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.200
among the crew,
as to our destination.

703
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.400
Shut your trap and make way.

704
00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.240
[sighs]

705
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.400
That's the way of it, then.
No disrespect, sir.

706
00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.600
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.

707
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.880
Whitecap Bay.

708
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.880
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

709
00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:01.320
And every worthless seaman
fears the name,
and rightly so,

710
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.760
though few know why
or dare to ask.

711
00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.520
Be the stories true?

712
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.600
Say what robs you of
your staunch heart, Gibbs,

713
00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:11.040
or forever leave it
to the wider fields of fancy.

714
00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.200
Mermaids, Captain.

715
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.080
Aye. Mermaids.
[crew murmuring]

716
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.400
Sea ghouls,
devil fish, dreadful in
hunger for flesh of man.

717
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.800
Mermaid waters,
that be our path.

718
00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.640
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

719
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.000
as mermaids be given
to take the rest...

720
00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.440
...to the bone.
[crew chattering]

721
00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.680
Steady! Steady, men!
Find your courage,

722
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.960
or be ready
to purpose your fear!

723
00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.040
[man] Save yourselves!

724
00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.880
[man] Man overboard!
Nay! A deserter.

725
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.760
Come about.
Nay!

726
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:53.920
Gentlemen, I shall not ask
any more of any man than what

727
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.520
that man can deliver,
but I do ask this:
Are we not king's men?

728
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.360
[all quietly] Aye.

729
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.000
On the king's mission?
[all louder] Aye.

730
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.040
I did not note any fear
in the eyes of the Spanish
as they passed us by.

731
00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.400
Are we not king's men?
[all shout] Aye!

732
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:13.360
Aye! Hands all off,
and bear away!

733
00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.520
Stave on ahead
to Whitecap Bay!

734
00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.600
[man] Bear on, Whitecap Bay!

735
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.600
[man plays up-tempo
guitar music]

736
00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:36.920
<i>Hola...</i>
Come. Little drink?

737
00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.400
Wine, music, candlelight.

738
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.480
I think we've traveled down
this road before, Jack.

739
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.760
Yes, we have.

740
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.400
I remember it well.

741
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.480
Winding, twisting and
turning, gyrating, writhing.

742
00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.120
Incessant writhing.

743
00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.440
Do you recall
Saint Dominique?

744
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.400
La Martinique.

745
00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.440
I tried to kill you
in Saint Dominique.

746
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.280
Either or.

747
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.200
Hardly appropriate
for a first mate.

748
00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.800
Was I the first?
I've often wondered.

749
00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.800
You can be so charming
when you want something, Jack.

750
00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.400
The trick is
finding out what.

751
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.920
[Jack] The truth,
then, is it?

752
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.920
Blackbeard has served
his purpose.

753
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.600
You and I can go to
the Fountain together,

754
00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.280
where we shall
bathe one another

755
00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.040
in equal shares of fame

756
00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.080
and other assorted
debaucheries.

757
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.040
And I'll tell you
the ritual of the Fountain.

758
00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:39.040
Yes. The profane ritual.

759
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.600
[gasps]

760
00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.640
[inhales deeply]
Can I trust you, Jack?

761
00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.120
I need you on my side.

762
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.560
Oh, my dearest Angelica.

763
00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:52.200
You and I are as
thick as thieves, love.

764
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.880
Tell me the rules.

765
00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:00.200
Water from the
Fountain of Youth.

766
00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.400
The shimmering tear
of a mermaid.

767
00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.840
The silver chalices
of Ponce de Leon.

768
00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:12.680
Uh-huh?
With these items...

769
00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.040
Yes?
With these items,

770
00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.600
you may take all the years
of life from another, Jack.

771
00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.440
Eh?
You know what that means.

772
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:25.320
We cannot go alone,
you and I.

773
00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.000
The ritual
requires a victim.

774
00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:33.840
That is unfortunate.
Yes, it is.

775
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.440
I find my desire for the
Fountain greatly lessened.

776
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.560
But there is something
on board you do want.

777
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.800
What about Blackbeard?

778
00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:52.400
He's in the chart room.
We'll have to be quick.

779
00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.960
[door creaks]

780
00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:04.240
He keeps each ship
as a prize.

781
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:10.720
You help me, and I
promise you your pick.

782
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.840
Though I think I know
the one you will choose.

783
00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:17.520
[thundering]

784
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.760
The <i>Black Pearl</i>
in a bottle?

785
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.080
Why is the <i>Black Pearl</i>
in a bottle?

786
00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.640
[chittering]
[shouts] Oh!

787
00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.080
He's even more
annoying in miniature.

788
00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:36.720
Do we have a deal, Jack?
Angelica, I know you.

789
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.920
You are not going to steal
the life of some innocent man.

790
00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.720
What about the
one-legged man?

791
00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:47.120
[door creaks]
I need years, Jack.

792
00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.920
Not for me. For my father.

793
00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.880
I am truly the daughter
of Blackbeard.

794
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.080
[inhales] You've fallen
for your own con, love.

795
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.120
No, he is my father.

796
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.280
The lies I told you
were not lies.

797
00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.880
You lied to me
by telling me the truth?

798
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.960
Yes.
That's very good.

799
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.880
May I use that?
I'm sure you will, anyway.

800
00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.720
Of course I will.

801
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.560
So, will you not
give up this quest?

802
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.880
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.

803
00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:27.360
Angelica,
your father, Blackbeard...

804
00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.200
...he is evil,

805
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.560
and he will kill you
given the chance.

806
00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.800
He cannot be saved.
And who are you to set

807
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.680
the limits on redemption?

808
00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.640
You stole years of my life,
Jack. You owe me.

809
00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:44.600
And you are en route
to getting yourself killed,

810
00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.120
and I am not inclined
to stand by and watch.

811
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.760
[man shouting] Whitecap Bay!
[bell ringing]

812
00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:59.680
All hands on deck!
Set to the longboats!

813
00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.280
[indistinct chatter]
[Blackbeard]
Lay 'em out flat!

814
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:09.920
No tangles. Make 'em look
pretty for our dainty guests.

815
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.360
We're gonna need light.
A lot of light.

816
00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.000
Come!

817
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:43.720
Smell that? Whale oil.
Stuff burns like
a miracle from God.

818
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.680
Can you make it work?
Made by the English.

819
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.160
Let's not get our hopes up.

820
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.080
[wood creaking]

821
00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.280
The old moon in
the arms of the new one.

822
00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.960
First of the summer.

823
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.280
Perfect for hunting
a mermaid's tear.

824
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.680
We're doomed. They be drawn
to man-made light.

825
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.760
Sharks?
Worse than sharks, boy.

826
00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.120
There'll be mermaids upon us
within the hour,

827
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:32.560
you mark my words.
And we're the bait.

828
00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:41.400
I heard it said a kiss
from a mermaid protects
a sailor from drowning.

829
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:45.280
Don't be a fool!
Mermaids are all female, son,

830
00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:47.880
and lovely
as a dream of heaven.

831
00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:52.240
But when it comes time
to churn butter,
so to speak,

832
00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.680
they snatch a sailor
out of a boat

833
00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:57.800
or off the deck of a ship,
have their way,

834
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.960
and then the sailors
are pulled to bottom
and drowned and eaten.

835
01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.840
Or, sometimes,
the other way around.

836
01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.800
[Gunner] Sing.
What?

837
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.320
They like to hear singing.

838
01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.200

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.520

Man, look. Look there.

853
01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.240
[grunts]
You'll scare her off!

854
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.280
Aye, and good riddance!

855
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.480
Can you talk?

856
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.120
Yes.

857
01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.960
You're beautiful.

858
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.000
Are you the one who sings?
[Scrum] Aye.

859
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.360
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

860
01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.040
[chuckles]

861
01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.200
Aye, that I be.
Scrum, comport yourself!

862
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.680
Boys! There ain't much
been given to me

863
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.080

I'll have it said

that Scrum had himself a kiss
from a proper mermaid!

Well done, sailor.

940
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.200
Did everyone see that?

941
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.440
Because I will not
be doing it again.

942
01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.200
Back to the ship. We head
for a protected cove. Now.

[Gibbs] Mermaid.

946
01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.680
Give up this madness now.
I cannot.

947
01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.080
Ever walk on the beach,

948
01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.120
look back and see your
footsteps in the sand?

949
01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.880
It's like that, except
the footsteps lie before me.

950
01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.320
Footstep, actually.
Whitecap Bay, sir.

951
01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.840
We must hasten.

We travel by foot.
Gibbs, I require a heading.

954
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.680
But, sir, the men.
They be dead already.

955
01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.200
They don't sound dead.
Oh, is that so?

956
01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:30.080
Well, I hear nothing
but seagulls nesting.

957
01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.720
What is it that you hear,
Mr. Groves?

958

[men continue shrieking]

959
01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.200
Seagulls... nesting.

960
01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.400
Nothing more.
Heading, Gibbs?

[wood creaking]
[screaming continues]

962
01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.760
My God.

[gun cocking]
Your head or my heading.

964
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.080
I'll have me one or t'other,
I don't care which.

All hands, forward!

967
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.640
It's to you now, Sparrow.
Was that really necessary?

968
01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.280
Best you not know the exact
whereabouts of my ship.

969
01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.120
I be a cautious man.
So be I.

970
01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.000
What I want first...

971
01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.160
[clicking]

972
01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.800

[birds squawking]

975
01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.720
Why is it we've got
to bring her along?

976
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.800
Because tears don't keep.
We need them fresh.

977
01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.960
What is the ritual again?

978
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.640
Water from the Fountain
and a mermaid's tear?

979
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.120
And two silver chalices.

980
01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.400
One cup with a tear,
one without.

981
01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.680
So, one with a tear
and water in both?

982
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.240
Quite complicated,
is it not?

983
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.360
Both get water.
One gets a tear.

984
01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.200
The person who drinks
the water with the tear

985
01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.880
gets all the years
of life from the other.

986
01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.760
How many years? Whoa.

987
01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.680
All the years
that they have lived,

988
01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.880
and they could have lived,
if fate had been kinder.

989
01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.560

990
01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.720
Clergyman.

991
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.760
On the off chance that this
does not go well for me,

992
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.600
I would like it noted
here and now

993
01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:17.600
that I am fully prepared
to believe in whatever I must,

994
01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.760
so that I may be
welcomed into that place

995
01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.240
where all the goody-goodies
get to go. Savvy?

996
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:26.200
We have
a word for that, Jack.
You can convert.

997
01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.560
I was thinking more
of an as-needed basis.

998
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.880
[gasping]

999
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.000
Quartermaster!

1000
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.240
Aye?
She cannot breathe!

1001
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.280
She has water.
She needs air!

1002
01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.840
Open this.
She will escape.

1003
01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.280
You're killing her.
I support the
missionary's position.

1004
01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.800
[laughs]

1005
01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.000

[panting]

1008
01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:58.840
See?

1009
01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.200
Onward.

1010
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:33.280
Just as I thought.
Not this way!

1011
01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.880
This is the way,
isn't it?

1012
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.680
'Course it is,
but we should go
around to the east.

1013
01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.920
That would take us out of
the path of the chalices.

1014
01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.040
Well, then
we'll circle back.
There is no time.

1015
01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.640
You're the one
who insisted on bringing
the bloody mermaid.

1016
01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.680
Well, the mutiny
didn't help.
You walk like a girl.

1017
01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.920
You would know.
Someone must go.

1018
01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.400
You mean split up?

1019
01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.280
You mean jump?
This I cannot wait to see.

1020
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:59.360
Sparrow will go.
Find the ship,
retrieve the chalices.

1021
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.600
Sparrow? What makes you
think he will come back?

1022
01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:05.000
Yes, what makes you think
he will come back?

1023
01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.480
We cannot trust him, Father.
I'll go.

1024
01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.480
She'll go.

1025
01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.800
How much farther
to the Fountain?

1026
01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.920
I'm running out of time.

1027
01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.760
About a day's march north,
following that river,

1028
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.680
you'll get to
a series of pools.
Then you're close.

1029
01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.000
You will go.

1030
01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.880
I was sure
it would come to this.

1031
01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.640
You know that feeling
you get sometimes

1032
01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.800
when you're standing
in a high place?

1033
01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.000
Sudden urge to jump?

1034
01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.240
I don't have it.

1035
01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.560
[gun cocks]
I need those chalices.

1036
01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.200
Shoot. Save me
the bother of the fall.

1037
01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.720
You will go.
You will return...

1038
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.560
...or I will kill her.

1039
01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.080
You won't kill
your own daughter.

1040
01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.960
Quartermaster,
get me six more pistols,

1041
01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.720
remove the shot
from all but two,

1042
01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.680
but do not
tell me which two.

1043
01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.160
You get to choose,
Mr. Sparrow.
Oh.

1044
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.280
No. Mmm... No.

1045
01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.280
Yes.
You're sure?

1046
01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.760
'Course I am.

1047
01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.800
[gun clicks]

1048
01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.360
Again.

1049
01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:54.320
Please,
they're not even loaded.
[all gasp]

1050
01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.720
[all gasp]

1051
01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.400
Again.

1052
01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.120
If you're so keen
on killing her,

1053
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.720
why don't you just
let her jump?
What?

1054
01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.880
Mm-mm!
If you jump and die,

1055
01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.520
then she will
have her chance. 

1056
01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:13.960
Again.

1057
01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.880
Oi... if I jump,
will I survive?

1058
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.280
The doll.

1059
01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.880
[chanting in foreign language]

1060
01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:40.200
[Jack screaming]

1061
01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.520
[doll splashes in water]

1062
01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.600
Yes, now you will survive.
This is nonsense! I'm going!

1063
01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:54.320
[screaming]

1064
01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.280
[gasps]

1065
01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.080
Wet. Wet again.

1066
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.840
[Quartermaster] We go on.
Due north to the Fountain.

1067
01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.840
Well played, Father.

1068
01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.680
You knew which guns
were loaded, right?

1069
01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.960
Of course, my love.

1070
01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.920
Be nice to have
a map about now.

1071
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.200
Or a ship.
[crickets chittering]

1072
01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:45.360
Stop!
Hold very still.

1073
01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:49.840
Ye dare not let it
touch your skin.

1074
01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.080
What? What be wrong with
an older man having a hobby?

1075
01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.000
What are you
stopping for, eh?
Push on!

1076
01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:08.240
Push on!
You can sleep
when you're dead. Push on!

1077
01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:13.600
Fortune continues
to favor us.

1078
01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.560
The <i>Santiago.</i>

1079
01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.160
Famously captained
by Ponce de Leon.

1080
01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.240
Oh. There's no one there.

1081
01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.520
Right, then.

1082
01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.680
[seagulls crying]

1083
01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.600
[glass shatters]

1084
01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.040
[panting]

1085
01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.520
We must not stop.

1086
01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.880
[gasps]

1087
01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.960
You will walk.

1088
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:58.200
[grunts] I cannot.

1089
01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.480
Walk or die.

1090
01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.440
Put your arms around me.

1091
01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.760
I do not ask for help.
But you need it.

1092
01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:33.120
We're in a hurry, yes?
Do not fall behind.

1093
01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.440
Hold here till I say!

1094
01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.800
Such beauty.

1095
01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.320
Surely you're one of
God's own creations,

1096
01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:16.000
and not a descendant
of those dark creatures

1097
01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.800
who found
no refuge on the Ark.

1098
01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:22.120
Such beauty...

1099
01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.840
...and yet deadly.

1100
01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.440
Deadly? No.

1101
01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.400
You attacked me.

1102
01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.400
No. You are different.

1103
01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.600
Different?

1104
01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.920
Are you not? You protect.

1105
01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.120
[mutters] Did you...?

1106
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.120
You pushed me down
out of the way.

1107
01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:56.160
You see the Fountain?
No, but we are close.

1108
01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.720
Bring the creature.
Cover its head.

1109
01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.720
She has a name!

1110
01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.760
Pray tell.

1111
01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.640
She is Syrena.

1112
01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.000
[grunting]

1113
01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.640
[grunts]

1114
01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:55.240
[wood creaking]
[wind whistling]

1115
01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.680
Ponce de Leon.

1116
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.960
[Barbossa] If 40 pirates
dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

1117
01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.560
it would not match
the contents of this room.

1118
01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.240
You.

1119
01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.760
You.
No...

1120
01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.280
...you.
I was here first.

1121
01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:22.440
You, why are you here?
Blackbeard sent me.

1122
01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.080
Why are you?
Silver chalices

1123
01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.520
for my royal liege.
Oh, please.

1124
01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.920
Back, back! We have
to balance it out!

1125
01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.080
The whole ship will slide!

1126
01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:40.880
Right, then.

1127
01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:47.520
What if we each choose
an item of approximately
equal weight?

1128
01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:51.640
Put it back!

1129
01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.960
We touch nothing!

1130
01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:02.640
[objects rattling]

1131
01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.680
What about that?

1132
01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.280
The chalices.

1133
01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.440
Oi! Why do you
get to look first?

1134
01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.680
Fine, then.

1135
01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:17.200
[ship groaning]
[grunts]

1136
01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.160
[grunts]

1137
01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.280
[both] Together.

1138
01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.240
[Jack] Rocks.

1139
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.760
The Spanish.

1140
01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.200
They're ahead of us, mate.

1141
01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.720
I shall have
a look at that map.

1142
01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.680
If it's what I fear...

1143
01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.720
[grunts]

1144
01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.120
[mutters indistinctly]
[coin tinkles]

1145
01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.360
I wonder why they
left this behind.

1146
01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:04.360
[whispering]
Don't touch the map.

1147
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.160
Oh.

1148
01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.160
They know the path,

1149
01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:15.080
but I can also see where
they'll most likely make camp.

1150
01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.200
[Gibbs] Jack!
Shh!

1151
01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:36.200
Gibbs, I was just on me way
to break you out of jail.

1152
01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:40.280
Hmm.
You stole my map.

1153
01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.440
Oh!
Right. Best be started.

1154
01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.720
Ole.

1155
01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.200
[Blackbeard] Mermaids.

1156
01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.640
Careful, these pools run deep.

1157
01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.440
If she escapes, all is lost.
Quartermaster.

1158
01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.600
[hissing]
[Blackbeard] Look. Look!

1159
01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.360
Staked out to die,
to dry in the sun.

1160
01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:29.520
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live,

1161
01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:34.040
but just enough to make
the dying slow.

1162
01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.280
Think on it.

1163
01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.840
Your people, murdered,
harvested for their tears.

1164
01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.240
Syrena, won't you cry?

1165
01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.000
All die, even you.

1166
01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.440
Soon, I hear.
Listen...

1167
01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:54.360
[hisses]
Listen.

1168
01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:58.000
Can you not hear
your sisters scream?

1169
01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:01.200
[faint shrieks]
Do you not hear them?

1170
01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:03.880
We need but one tear.

1171
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.440
[gasps]
Vile creature!

1172
01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.200
Chop off her fingers,
one by one!
Choke her!

1173
01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.680
[man] Cut out the tears
from behind the eyes!

1174
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.680
Where's your voice in this?

1175
01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.920
Maybe she'll have
a change of heart

1176
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.520
when the sun rises.

1177
01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.080
Oh, aye,
she will burn,

1178
01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.560
but I cannot
wait for the sun.

1179
01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:25.320
Perhaps we should
build a fire.

1180
01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.440
No.
Do not contest me, cleric.

1181
01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:30.600
You will not torture her.
We need only one tear.

1182
01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.080
I will tear every scale
from her body one by one
if I see fit.

1183
01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.040
If that displeases you,
go pray.

1184
01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:39.080
I was wrong. Not every soul
can be saved. Yours cannot.

1185
01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.000
Behold, gentlemen,
a man formerly of faith.

1186
01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.600
That vile creature,
as you call her,

1187
01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.000
is worth
a hundred of you.

1188
01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.440
Oh, you care for her?

1189
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.920
You fancy her.

1190
01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.920
And do not deny what is
clear to my eyes.

1191
01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.280
Question is...

1192
01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:03.400
...does she fancy you?

1193
01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.680
By God, she does.
We are in luck!

1194
01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:13.760
Bring forth a tear...

1195
01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:16.560
...or witness the death
of this poor soul.

1196
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:18.720
[grunts, gasps]
[hisses]

1197
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:22.200
Syrena, if you could
manage a tear,

1198
01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:23.680
I would be grateful.

1199
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.000
Sadness, yes,

1200
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:32.520
but no sorrow... yet.
Not by your hand, Father!

1201
01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.440
Time and tide wait for none.
Quartermaster.

1202
01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:38.400
[grunt]
[pained cry]

1203
01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.560
Ooh, aye,
mermaids are tough.

1204
01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.840
The lot of them.

1205
01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:57.240
Tie her up like the others.
And get rid of this.

1206
01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.800
[Syrena struggling]

1207
01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.640
You are confident?
Yes.

1208
01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:08.440
I am a woman.
So is she.

1209
01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.240
[grunting]

1210
01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:19.320
[Gibbs]
What's your play, Jack?
Throwing in with Barbossa.

1211
01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.920
There is a girl...

1212
01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:25.680
...a female...
of the opposite sex.

1213
01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:29.600
When is there not?
Perhaps I should
say "damsel."

1214
01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:32.800
You're rescuing a damsel?
Well, there's a first.

1215
01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:36.080
Yes, but it's just that
I may have caused said damsel

1216
01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.920
some manner of harm
many moons ago.

1217
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.520
Out with it.

1218
01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:43.640
Gibbs, this is
the woman from Seville.

1219
01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.920
Ah, you pretended
to love her,

1220
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.520
then you left her
and broke her heart.

1221
01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:51.960
Worse. I may have had,
briefly, mind you...

1222
01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:57.000
...stirrings.
Stirrings?

1223
01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:01.440
Stirrings.
What? Like feelings,
you mean?

1224
01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:05.000
No, no, no.
Not quite all the way
to feelings. More like...

1225
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.800
All right,
feelings, damn you.

1226
01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:15.120
And you left her still.
Ooh, that's low.

1227
01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.280
Thank you.

1228
01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.280
[branch snaps]
Shh!

1229
01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.560
Stealth over force.

1230
01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:30.000
I'll take it from here
on account of your condition.

1231
01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.040
You don't have
termites, do you?

1232
01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.680
I appreciate
your concern, Jack,

1233
01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:38.040
but I'll be keeping
you company all the same.

1234
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:41.440
Hold here,
Lieutenant Commander.
Wait for my signal.

1235
01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.840
[indistinct chattering]

1236
01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.240
[indistinct chatter]

1237
01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.600
[Barbossa] There. That one.
That be the leader.

1238
01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.440
Make note of his tent
because that's where...

1239
01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:23.360
No, wait. By God,
that must be them
right there.

1240
01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:29.760
[sniffing]
Your sword smells funny.

1241
01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:34.600
Aye. Poison from the
innards of poisonous toads.

1242
01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:38.080
Just a scratch,
you're a dead man in minutes.

1243
01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:40.240
Would you mind pointing it
the other way?

1244
01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.680
I don't like toads.

1245
01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.400
What are you doing?

1246
01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.640
Planning an escape route.

1247
01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:52.320
Isn't that how you do it?

1248
01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:54.920
Yes.

1249
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.240
Or sometimes I just...
improvise.

1250
01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.440
Now what?

1251
01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:29.920
We stroll out,
slow and steady.

1252
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.720
Just like we belong.

1253
01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.920
[all grunting]
[swords clanging]

1254
01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.560
[guns cocking]

1255
01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.920
[groaning]

1256
01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.600
[animal chirping nearby]

1257
01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.120
[footsteps approaching]

1258
01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.800
[panting] I'm sorry, Syrena.

1259
01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.920
Philip, you're alive.

1260
01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.120
Yes.

1261
01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.360
You came for me.

1262
01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:42.880
Why?

1263
01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.720
You're different,
are you not?

1264
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.600
Do you know not of kindness?
Compassion?

1265
01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.240
[grunting, yelling]

1266
01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.280
Tears of sorrow, never.

1267
01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.800
Mermaids be
too tough for that.

1268
01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.880
But tears of joy...

1269
01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:22.400
They say these be
the more potent anyway.

1270
01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.720
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.

1271
01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.080
Let her go.
You don't need her now.

1272
01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:31.080
Let her go? No.

1273
01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:34.000
Secure her bonds.
We leave her with her own.

1274
01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:46.200
[Jack] How's that
escape route working?

1275
01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.400
Here's your chance
to improvise.

1276
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.560
I'm attempting it.

1277
01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:53.360
I might be able to get
a hand loose.

1278
01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.800
Oh, you got a knife.
That's very good.

1279
01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:58.040
Better.

1280
01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:01.680
[liquid sloshing]

1281
01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:05.120
I want one of those.

1282
01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:13.480
Here's to revenge.
Sweet and clear.

1283
01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.800
Revenge?

1284
01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.120
Come, come, Hector.

1285
01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.120
If you wanted
the chalices,

1286
01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:22.200
you'd seen they were
missing and gone.

1287
01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:26.320
You were lying in wait,
for Blackbeard.

1288
01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.320
Oh?

1289
01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:31.520
King George.
Privateer. Wig.

1290
01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.160
Cheap theatrical facade.
I'm not buying it.

1291
01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.240
You weren't there that night.

1292
01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.720
When the <i>Pearl</i> was lost?

1293
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.280
Taken, not lost.

1294
01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.320
We were off the coast
of Hispaniola when

1295
01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.800
we came under attack.
<i>[ship creaking]</i>

1296
01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:51.200
No provocation nor warning
nor offer of parley.

1297
01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:54.080
We were peppered
with cannon fire.

1298
01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.280
<i>[shots firing]</i>

1299
01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:58.520
And then the sea beneath
the <i>Pearl</i> began to roil.

1300
01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.160
<i>[sea roiling]</i>

1301
01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.680
The <i>Pearl</i> was pitching
and yawing violently.

1302
01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.400
Every plank, every rail,

1303
01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:07.520
every spar, all at once,
began to creak.

1304
01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:10.440
The rigging had come to life.
<i>[ship creaking]</i>

1305
01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.280
Our own ship
turned against us...

1306
01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:16.920
...tangling the crew,
wrapping around 'em
like snakes.

1307
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
And wrapping around me leg.

1308
01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:22.200
But me arms were free
and me sword was to hand.

1309
01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.440
I am the master of me ship,
not Blackbeard.

1310
01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:29.520
I am the master of my fate,
not Blackbeard.

1311
01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:33.040
So I did what needed done.

1312
01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.520
I survived.

1313
01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:47.440
So... you're not
after the Fountain.

1314
01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:51.240
I care not for King George
or tavern yarns

1315
01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.480
that give hope
for a healed limb.

1316
01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:58.920
But I'd give my left arm
for a chance at Blackbeard.

1317
01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.960
Not your right?
I need me good arm

1318
01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:06.800
to drive my poisoned blade
through his heart.

1319
01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.160
I'll see you get
the chance, mate.

1320
01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.840
[soft grunting]

1321
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.640
[indistinct chatter
in Spanish]

1322
01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.680
[tree creaking]
[wind whistling]

1323
01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.160
[creaking]

1324
01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:30.240
The prisoner's escaping.

1325
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:36.920
[grunting]

1326
01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.360
He's escaping!
Fan out! Find him!

1327
01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:43.360
Go! Go!
[gunfire]

1328
01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.680
Hold your fire!
I want him alive!

1329
01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:50.280
[shouting in Spanish]

1330
01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:56.360
I figured
that was the signal.

1331
01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.800
[men yelling]

1332
01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.160
[men shouting]

1333
01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.760
[men shouting in Spanish]

1334
01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:41.240
Go! Prepare to move out!

1335
01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.800
The enemy is soon upon us.

1336
01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:46.480
I'm sorry about
the chalices, Jack,

1337
01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:47.840
but I've an
appointment to keep.

1338
01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.120
I'll not be going back.

1339
01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:50.440
No need.

1340
01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.440
Shall we have a drink?

1341
01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:54.040
We'll drink at the Fountain.

1342
01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:07.520
[birds chirping]

1343
01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.480
[gasps]

1344
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.480
How is it we can never meet

1345
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.560
without you pointing
something at me?

1346
01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:19.280
You brought the chalices,
Sparrow?

1347
01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:21.600
Aye. Oi!

1348
01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.280
[pig oinking]

1349
01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:28.080
[Angelica] I see you
brought a friend.
[Jack] I did.

1350
01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:32.000
And the one-legged man,
he is near. Aye?

1351
01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:33.080
Aye.

1352
01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:37.000
Now... Before I go
just handing them over,

1353
01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.400
I do have one
or two conditions.

1354
01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:40.080
Name them.
Firstly,

1355
01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:41.920
I'll be having
me compass back.

1356
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.360
No, no,
that's secondly.

1357
01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:45.360
Firstly, upon your word,

1358
01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.560
you will bring
no harm to Angelica.

1359
01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.080
[Blackbeard] I'll make
no vows to the likes
of you, Sparrow.

1360
01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:53.120
But it costs me
nothing to admit

1361
01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.560
that she was never
in harm's way.

1362
01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.160
Secondly then,
priorly firstly,

1363
01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.160
I will be having
me compass back.

1364
01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.120
Please? I do deserve it.

1365
01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.840
Do you have any idea
how difficult it was

1366
01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.200
to catch that filthy pig?

1367
01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:09.200
Not the big one,
the four-legged one.

1368
01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:16.560
Thank you.
And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

1369
01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.400
there are times,
not very often,

1370
01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:22.640
when I do reflect
upon my heinous misdeeds.

1371
01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:27.040
Chief among them,
I note how poorly I have
treated Mr. Gibbs,

1372
01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.320
my loyal first mate.

1373
01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:30.280
Aye! Now you bring it up...

1374
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.680
Left him to rot in jail,
I did. Didn't care.

1375
01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:37.160
Still don't. But, point being,
you must let him go free.

1376
01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:40.240
Is that it?

1377
01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.320
I think so.

1378
01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:45.400
Quick, or the pig runs,
and good luck getting
those chalices.

1379
01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.040
Jack, if it's all the same
to you, I'd be just as...

1380
01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:47.880
Done.

1381
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.760
Release the swine.

1382
01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.080
[squealing]

1383
01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:57.000
Perhaps, if you don't mind,

1384

02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:50.520
To kill myself
before I starve?

1561
02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.280
[Jack] There's no
trusting you, love.

1562
02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:54.920
Besides, this is
a well-traveled trade route.

1563
02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.760
You can signal a passing ship.

1564
02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:00.160
Or you can just
bite the proverbial
bullet, as it were.

1565
02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:02.760
And how will I get free
of these bonds?

1566
02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:04.880
You broke free of your bonds
half an hour ago,

1567
02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:07.400
waiting for the precise
moment to pounce.

1568
02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:12.080
Admit it, Jack.

1569
02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:13.760
You still love me.

1570
02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:16.400
If you had a sister
and a dog,

1571
02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:18.480
I'd choose the dog.

1572
02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:22.600
Treasure! There is
a chest with jewels!

1573
02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:24.920
Jewels with the power
to rule the wind and tide!

1574
02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.120
You're making that up!

1575
02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:29.160
Wait... [panting]

1576
02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:32.400
I am with child. Yours.

1577
02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:35.160
I don't recall
that we ever had...

1578
02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:36.120
You were drunk!

1579
02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:38.040
I've actually
never been that drunk.

1580
02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:39.400
Wait!

1581
02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:43.240
There is something
I want to say to you.

1582
02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:47.520
Something I wanted to say
from the moment we first met.

1583
02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:49.640
Go on, then.

1584
02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:53.400
I love you.

1585
02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:58.280
As do I.

1586
02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:02.400
Always have.
Always will.

1587
02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:08.120
I gotta go.

1588
02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:09.360
Jack!

1589
02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:13.320
This is not over!

1590
02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:15.440
Jack!

1591
02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:24.120
[gunshot]
[water splashes]

1592
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.240
Missed!

1593
02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:29.920
[Angelica screaming
in Spanish]

1594
02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:44.720
The <i>Revenge</i> is mine.

1595
02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:52.960
Sir...

1596
02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:57.400
We found this
below decks.

1597
02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:06.960
[sword vibrating]

1598
02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:18.960
[men yelling]

1599
02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:25.920
All hands!
Ply to windward!

1600
02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:28.960
Get cracking,
ye blooming cockroaches!

1601
02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.080
[cackling]
[all laughing]

1602
02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:34.960
The Crown served me well.

1603
02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:37.720
But now, by the gods
of sea and sky...

1604
02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:41.520
...make way for Tortuga!

1605
02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:43.560
[men shouting]

1606
02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:56.280
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted
shellback, you made it!

1607
02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:57.720
[Gibbs] Aye!

1608
02:05:57.800 --> 02:05:59.720
And I trust
we managed a profit

1609
02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:01.640
from our joint enterprise?

1610
02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:04.120
Feast your eyes.

1611
02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:11.680
The compass led me
straight and true.

1612
02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:13.960
What of Blackbeard's men
guarding the ship?

1613
02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:17.280
I employed the selfsame
maneuver we perfected
in New Guinea.

1614
02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:18.000
Oh.

1615
02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:21.800
Seemed a shame to leave
an entire fleet behind.

1616
02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:24.400
Shame indeed.
[chuckles]

1617
02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:35.080
[bird squawking]
[squealing]

1618
02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:37.520
I hate that monkey.

1619
02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:38.640
So, the <i>Pearl...</i>

1620
02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:40.800
Any idea how
to get her out?

1621
02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:44.240
We shall need a crossbow,
an hourglass, three goats.

1622
02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:47.560
One of us must learn to
play the trumpet whilst the
other one goes like this...

1623
02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:49.120
I know a man with a goat.

1624
02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:51.280
Good. I can go like this.

1625
02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:55.600
[Gibbs] Jack,
I have to ask...

1626
02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:58.320
You had the chalices,
the water, the tear...

1627
02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:01.400
You could have lived
maybe forever.

1628
02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:03.280
[Jack] The Fountain
does test you, Gibbs.

1629
02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:06.040
But better to not know
which moment may be your last.

1630
02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:08.520
Every morsel
of your entire being

1631
02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:11.520
alive to the infinite
mystery of it all.

1632
02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:14.400
And who's to say
I won't live forever, eh?

1633
02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:18.240
Discoverer of the
Fountain of Youth.
[chuckling]

1634
02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:20.880
[Jack] I have
no say in it, Gibbs.

1635
02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:22.880
It's a pirate's life for me.

1636
02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:25.280
Savvy?

1637
02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:39.480
[gulls crying]

1638
02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:04.800
[thunder rumbling]

1639
02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:10.120
[thunder cracks]
