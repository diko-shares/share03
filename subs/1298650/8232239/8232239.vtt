[flag rustling]

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.180
[fireworks crackling]

[thunder rumbling]

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.220
[man speaking Spanish]
<i>Capitan! Capitan!</i>

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.620
[grunts]

10
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.100
Who are you?

11
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.940
[horses panting]

12
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.500
[man shouts indistinctly]

13
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.220
[man shouting indistinctly]

14
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.060
What is this?

15
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.580
Your Majesty, caught him
up in a fishing net.
A fishing net.

16
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.220
Sire, he's been telling
stories. Stories that...
We believe he's found a...

17
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.380
Ponce de Leon.

18
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.980
Says he found
Ponce de Leon's ship.

19
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.900
[man 2] Or sailed on it.
[man 1] No, I told you,

20
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.740
Ponce de Leon
died 200 years ago.

21
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.140
Aye, but he died searching
for something, didn't he?

22
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.260
The Fountain of Youth.

23
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.140
How soon can you sail?

24
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.740
With the tide.

25
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.260
[woman] Over here!
Lucky heather!

26
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.140
[man] Pirate swords!
Pirate swords!

27
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.420
Pirate's execution today.
Watch him swing!

28
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.780
[man] Pirate puppets!

29
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.100
Take that, you!
[girl] Hurry, Papa,
or we'll miss the hanging!

30
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.860
It's not a hanging, dear,
it's a trial. The hanging
comes this afternoon.

31
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.780
[man] Pirate hanging today!

32
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.420
[door creaks]
Come on. Up you get.

33
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.780
Move along, pirate.

34
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.020
Or should I say,
"Captain Pirate"? [laughs]

35
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.020
Come on. Come on! Up you go.

36
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.300
[crowd shouting]
[man] Quiet! Order!

37
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.740
[pounding gavel]
[man] Quiet!

38
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.460
Now appearing
before the court,

39
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.340
the notorious and infamous
pirate, pillager,

40
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.620
and highwayman...
Quiet!

41
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.740
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

42
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.460
[crowd jeering]

43
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.420
I told you, the name's Gibbs!
Joshamee Gibbs!

44
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.980
How many times...
[man] Hear ye, hear ye!
Presiding over these trials,

45
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.580
all rise and attend, the
Right Honorable Justice Smith!

46
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.780
[crowd shouting]

47
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.900
My dear sir.

48
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.740
Quiet!
[pounding gavel]

49
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.060
Now...

50
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.700
...what do we have here?

51
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.420
Jack?

52
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.020
Shut up!
[grunts]

53
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.100
[crowd chattering]
I don't recognize him.

54
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.460
Not necessary.
You were saying?

55
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.820
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

56
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.220
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.
[crowd shouting]

57
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.980
Is that so?

58
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.100
It says Jack Sparrow here.
[Gibbs] I told 'em.

59
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.540
I'm not Jack Sparrow,
who I would be happy
to identify to the court

60
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.740
if it would help my case.
I think that would
be a poor defense,

61
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.420
unless you want
to be bludgeoned again
like a harp seal.

62
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.860
[crowd shouting]
[Jack] The prisoner
claims of being innocent

63
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.220
to being Jack Sparrow.
How do you find?

64
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.220
No trial? But aren't we here
to examine the evidence...

65
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.900
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

66
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.580
Guilty verdict
means he'll hang.

67
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.580
[crowd cheering]
Hang him! String him up!

68
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.340
[crowd quiets]

69
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.940
Guilty?
That's not fair!

70
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.780
[crowd cheering]
Shut it.

71
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.100
[pounds gavel]

72
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.140
Joshamee Gibbs,
the crime of which

73
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.740
you've been found guilty of

74
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.340
is being innocent
of being Jack Sparrow.

75
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.700
I hereby
commute your sentence,

76
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.420
and order
that you be imprisoned
for the remainder

77
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.180
of your miserable, moribund,
mutton-chopped life.

78
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.820
What?!
Hang him!

79
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.220
[woman] Hang him!
There.

80
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.380
Balderdash!
String him up!
Hang him high!

81
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.380
[clamoring]

82
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.300
Means shall be arranged
to transport this prisoner

83
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.660
to the Tower of London.

84
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.660
[muffled shouting]

85
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.060
Thanks very much.

86
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.900
Ta.

87
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.180
Come on. Get up there.

88
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.100
Get up!

89
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.620
Hell's teeth. Now we're
both headed for prison.

90
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.700
Not to worry.
I've paid off the driver.

91
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.060
Ten minutes, we'll be outside
London Town, horses waiting.

92
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.620
Tonight, we make the coast.

93
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.540
Then it's just a matter
of finding a ship.

94
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.940
[Gibbs] All part
of the plan, yes?
[Jack] Exactly.

95
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.020
I arrived in London Town
just this morning

96
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.620
to rescue one
Joshamee Gibbs

97
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.460
from one appointment
with the gallows.

98
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.260
Seeing as how
you're still alive,

99
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.340
I'd say it's all been
very successful thus far.

100
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.420
What happened
to you, Gibbs?

101
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.300
I thought you were
employed elsewhere
or otherwise engaged.

102
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.980
Aye. But I always listened
like a thief for news
of the <i>Black Pearl.

103
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.260
Nobody's seen where
she might next make port.

104
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.340
Then, I hear a rumor:

105
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.020
Jack Sparrow's in London
with a ship and looking
for a crew.

106
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.780
Am not.
But that's what I heard.

107
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.460
Fact is, you're
signing up men tonight.

108
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.020
Pub called
The Captain's Daughter.

109
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.540
Am not!
Well, I thought it
a bit odd,

110
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.180
but then, you've never
been the most predictable
of sorts.

111
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.460
Tell me something.
There is another

112
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.020
Jack Sparrow out there
sullying my good name?

113
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.380
An impostor.
Indeed.

114
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.140
But... an impostor
with a ship.

115
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.340
And in need of a crew.

116
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.980
Which, as fate
would have it, so am I.

117
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.420
What about you, Jack?

118
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.580
Last I heard
you were hell-bent

119
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.780
to find
the Fountain of Youth.

120
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.300
Any luck?

121
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.540
Circumstances arose
and forced
a compelling insight

122
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.580
regarding discretion
and valor.

123
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.660
Meaning, you gave up.
I did not.

124
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.780
I am just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.

125
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.620
I shall taste those waters,
Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

126
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.780
Oh. Short trip.
[chuckles]

127
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.580
All part
of the plan, yes?

128
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.140
[grunts] No.

129
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.900
[door closes, locks]

130
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.500
[footsteps receding]

131
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.460
[horses trotting, neighing]

132
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.340
[distant chattering]

133
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.100
[distant banging]

134
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.780
[grunts]

135
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.780
[marching footsteps approach]

136
00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.140
You are Jack Sparrow?

137
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.940
There should be a "Captain"
in there somewhere.

138
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.900
I've heard of you.

139
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.740
And you know who I am.

140
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.340
Face is familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

141
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.020
You are in the presence
of George Augustus,
Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg,

142
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.260
Archtreasurer
and Prince-elector
of the Holy Roman Empire,

143
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.740
King of Great Britain
and Ireland, and of you.

144
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.460
Doesn't ring a bell.
I am informed

145
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:04.220
you have come to London
to procure a crew
for your ship.

146
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.580
Vicious rumor. Not true.

147
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.780
Then you lied to me when you
told me you were Jack Sparrow.

148
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.100
I am Jack Sparrow, but I'm
not here to procure a crew.

149
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.540
That is... someone else.

150
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:20.900
Ah. Someone else
named Jack Sparrow.

151
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.260
You've brought me
the wrong wastrel.

152
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.700
Find the proper one
and dispose of this impostor.

153
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.780
No, wait, wait.
Hang on a minute.

154
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.300
I'm Jack Sparrow,
the one and only.

155
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.860
And I am in London.

156
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.620
To procure a crew.
[chains clanking loudly]

157
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.420
To undertake a voyage
to the Fountain...
What?

158
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.420
Will someone please remove
these infernal chains?

159
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.940
[sighs] Come, come.
[chains clanking]

160
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.940
We know you're
in possession of a map.

161
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.300
So confiscate the map,
and to the gallows with him!

162
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.100
Have you a map?

163
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.700
No.
Where is it?

164
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.020
The truth? I lost it.

165
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.340
Quite recently, in fact.
I have a report.

166
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.180
The Spanish have located
the Fountain of Youth.

167
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:19.340
I will not have some
melancholy Spanish monarch,

168
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.180
a Catholic,
gain eternal life!

169
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.100
[silverware clattering]

170
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.860
You do know the way
to the Fountain?

171
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.140
Of course I do.
Look at me.

172
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.020
You could guide
an expedition.

173
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.100
With your permission,
your heinie,

174
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.220
you will be providing,
then, a ship...

175
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.620
...and a crew?

176
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.460
And a captain.

177
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.300
Afternoon, sire.

178
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.220
If I may be so bold,
why is that man not
in chains?

179
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.500
He must be
manacled at once.

180
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.140
At the center
of my palace? Hardly.

181
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.940
Hector.

182
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.980
How nice to see
a fellow pirate
make good of himself.

183
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.980
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

184
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:30.220
On a sanctioned mission
under the authority and
protection of the Crown.

185
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.740
As may be, but first,

186
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.220
what has become of
my beloved <i>Pearl?

187
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.460
I lost the Pearl
<i>as I lost my leg.</i>

188
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.900
Lost the Pearl?
<i>Aye.</i>

189
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.820
I defended
her mightily enough,
but she be sunk nonetheless.

190
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.060
If that ship
be sunk properly,
you should be sunk with it.

191
00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:01.780
Captain Barbossa,
each second we tarry,
the Spanish outdistance us.

192
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.500
I have every confidence
you will prevail
and be rewarded

193
00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.540
with the high station
you so desire.

194
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.340
To serve doth suffice, sire.
You, sir, have stooped.

195
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.700
Jack, our sands
be all but run.

196
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.020
Where's the harm in
joining the winning side?

197
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.940
And you do meet
a nicer class of person.

198
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.220
I understand everything.

199
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.420
Except that wig.

200
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.500
[man] He's getting away!
Stop him!

201
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.940

[man 3] No!
Stop that pirate!

203
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.140
Come down!

204
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.300
He escaped?
Leave it to me, sire.

205
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.780

Find him!

[whistle trilling]

210
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.420

Is that it?

218
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.900
Oh!

219
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.620
[man] Halt!
Stop that carriage!

220
00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.900
[man 2] Head him off!

Whoa! He's getting away!
After him! Stop him!

Hello, Jackie.

Hello, Dad.

243
00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.380
Whoo! [laughs]

[snoring]
[laughter]

245
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.500
[Teague] I heard you're
putting together a crew.

246
00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.620
If enough people keep
saying it, it must be true.

247
00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.540
I heard where you're headed.
The Fountain.

248
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.060
Have you been there?

249
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.220
Does this face look like it's been
to the Fountain of Youth?

250
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.860
Depends on the light.
Son, the Fountain.

251
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.780
There'll be items required
for the profane ritual.

252
00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.660
Two chalices.

253
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.980
On the map
there was a chalice.

254
00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.780
Two, silver.

255
00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.900
From the Ponce de Leon ship.
You'll need both.

256
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.660
For?
The ritual.
Don't be a fool, Jackie.

257
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.780
Find out every detail
before you set sail.

258
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.740
Oh, set sail. Love to.

259
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.260
But for that,
I may need a ship.

260
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.660
Those folk, over there,
they have a ship.

261
00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.980
They're signing up
sailors right now.

last thing, Jackie.

265
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.460
The Fountain will test you.
Mark my words.

Aye. That is,

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.140
Jack Sparrow be putting
together a modest venture.

ain't ya?

Turning up here
dressed like that?

What are you,
some kind of impostor?

277
00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.820
Have you any idea
who I am, mate?

I'm sailing with Sparrow.

286
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.580
[man] Bring us
some more of those ones.

287
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.980
Yeah, make it four.

288
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.980
You've stolen me, and I'm
here to take meself back.

289
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.180
Stop doing that.

297
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.660
Always wanted to do that.

Hello, Angelica.

Hello, Jack.
Are you impressed?

301
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.500
I think I almost killed you
once or twice there.

302
00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.260
I'm touched at this most
sincerest form of flattery.

303
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.020
But why?

304
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.540
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.

305
00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.460
That is not a compliment.

[buttons clattering]

307
00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.180
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you
a long time ago.

308
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.780
For what? For leaving you?
Recall that I left you.

309
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.300
A gentleman allows a lady
to maintain her fictions.

310
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.140
Look, Sparrow. As long as
my sailors get their money,

311
00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.340
they're willing
to put up with any number
of peculiarities.

312
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.420
Ah. There is
one peculiarity

313
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.460
with which I will
not put up with.

314
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.900
I will be impersonated
as "Captain." Nothing less.

315
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.940
Well, for that,
you need a ship,

316
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.540
and as it turns out,
I have one.

317
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.820
I could use a ship.

318
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.900
I hear tell you've
been to the Fountain.

319
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.740
There be a lot
of hear-telling
going on these days.

Dearest Angelica, fret not.

321

You still have
a few usable years left.

Always so charming.

323
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.220
You didn't answer me.
Eh?

324
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.660
Aye. Regarding the Fountain.
Waste of time, really...

[man] Open it!

Yeah, you haven't changed.
Implying the need?

Yes.

[man] Open this door,
in the name of His Majesty.

335
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.820
You betrayed me.
You seduced me
and you used me.

336
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.940
I was innocent
of the ways of men.

337
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.300
You demonstrated a lot
of technique for someone
I supposedly corrupted.

338
00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.020
Imminent danger.
Here, now, milady!

339
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.060
[man] Open it!

340
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.700
I was ready to take my vows.
And you...

341
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.500
What were you doing in
a Spanish convent, anyway?

342
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.900
Mistook it for a brothel.
Honest mistake.

343
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.300
[pounding]
[men shouting]

344
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.980
There he is!
Over there!

[indistinct shouting]

347
00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.860
We are at a disadvantage.

348
00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.500
Speak for yourself.
Unlike some who pretend
to be,

349
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.900
but cannot, in fact,
hold a candle to,

350
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.860
I am
Captain Jack Sparrow.

351
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.020
[gasping]

352
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.740
How can you say
I used you?

353
00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.380
You know exactly how.

354
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.540
I know, but how
can you say it?

355
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.060
[growls]

356
00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.020
[distant buoy bell clanging]

357
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.180
[Angelica] So, what is it?
[Jack] What is what?

358
00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.340
About the Fountain.

359
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.380
What do you know?

360
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.660
You don't happen
to be in possession

361
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:49.060
of two silver chalices,
circa Ponce de Leon?

362
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.580
No.
Ha. Thought not.

363
00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.300
Why?
I hear stories.

364
00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.780
Rumors.

365
00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.620
You are, of course,
aware of the ritual.

366
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.620
Yes, I am.

367
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.540
Hmm.

368
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.540
What is it?
What is required?

369
00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.700
[projectile whizzes]
[grunts]

370
00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.820
Hmm?

371
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.340
A mermaid, Jack.

372
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.980
[dog barking]

373
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.540
[Gibbs]
There's been a mistake.

374
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:27.100
It's a life sentence,
not death. Life!

375
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.900
Barbossa.
Thank you, gentlemen.

376
00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.020
I trust
you can tie a noose.

377
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.500
That's a hard thing,

378
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.380
forcing a man to twist
his own hanging rope.

379
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.660
You must lie in your bed
the way you made it.

380
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.780
What's happened to you?

381
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.500
Where be Jack Sparrow?
He escaped. [chuckles]

382
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.300
I'm on a tight
schedule, Gibbs.

383
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.580
The HMS Providence
<i>sets sail at first light,</i>

384
00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.180
and if you do not care
to watch it,
hanging here dead,

385
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.340
with a mouth full of flies...

386
00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.220
...speak now.

387
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.540
Take me with you.
Any point of the compass...

388
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:14.540
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain? Aye?

389
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.180
Is that where
Jack be headed?

390
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.900
Have you anything
you can offer me, Gibbs?

391
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.420
Anything at all?

392
00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.660
Upon me naked word,
you'll not see the dawn.

393
00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.460
[rope creaking]

394
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.460
Hand it over.

395
00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.620
You fool!
I had just enough time

396
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.220
to study those
infernal circles.

397
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:53.500
Every route,
every destination.
All safe... in here.

398
00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.860
Welcome back
to His Majesty's navy,

399
00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.420
Master Gibbs.

400
00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.420
[waves crashing]
[wood creaking]

401
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.860
[snoring]

402
00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.020
[grunts]
[man] Show a leg, sailor!

403
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.780
Aye, sir.

404
00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.420
What?

405
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.820
[chickens clucking]
There's been
a horrible mistake.

406
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.380
Keep moving.
[men shouting]

407
00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.540
I'm not supposed to be here.
Many a man's woken up
at sea,

408
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.900
no idea what, when,
wherefore or why.

409
00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.900
No memory of the night afore,
whence he signed up

410
00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.780
and drank away
all his bonus money.

411
00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.660
No, no, no.
You don't understand, mate.

412
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.380
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.

413
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.500
Scrum, and the pleasure's
all mine. Now, keep moving.

414
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.340
[distant chattering]

415
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.980
Scrum.

416
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.020
[man] Get your elbows in!

417
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.900
Why is there a glass coffin?

418
00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.380
Do I look like
a man in charge?

419
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.460
Where am I?
'Scuse me,
Captain Sparrow, sir.

420
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.460
I be right honored
to welcome you aboard our

421
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.060
world-renowned
vessel of infamy,
<i>Queen Anne's Revenge.</i>

422
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.580
Blackbeard.

423
00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.180
[indistinct shouting]

424
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.460
Work!
[screams]

425
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:37.540
[Jack] He's a curious one.
[Scrum] He's been
zombiefied.

426
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.180
Eh?
Zombiefied.

427
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.820
Blackbeard's doing.
All the officers
are the same.

428
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.060
Makes 'em more compliant.
[shouts]

429
00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.060
And perpetually ill-tempered.

430
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.060
Come on. Scrub.
Yeah.

431
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.060
[crew chanting]
Pull! Pull! Pull!

432
00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.820
[grunting]

433
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.020
[Jack] Five days underway,
at least.

434
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.740
Aye. You can tell that
by the smell of the sea?

435
00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.980
Smell of the crew.

436
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.780
[seagulls crying]
[Jack] Oi. What did
that poor sod do?

437
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.740
And how can I
make sure to not?

438
00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.100
Him? Churchly fellow.

439
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.580
Always going on about
the Lord Almighty.

440
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.340
Bible-thumper on this ship?

441
00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.260
A missionary
is his story.

442
00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.860
What I heard was
he got captured in a raid.

443
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.060
Rest of the ship
got killed, but not 'im.

444
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.820
First mate
wouldn't let it happen

445
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.740
on account of his premier
standing with the Lord.

446
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.740
A first mate sticking her
neck out for some prisoner.

447
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.780
That you don't see.

448
00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.620
"Her"?
First mate is a "her"?

449
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.540
[man] Back to work!

450
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.980
Steady as she goes.

451
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.780
[gasps]
[blade unsheathes]

452
00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:25.420
You are a ruthless,
soulless, cross-grained cur.

453
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.260
I told you I had a ship.
No, Blackbeard has a ship,

454
00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.620
upon which I am
now imprisoned.

455
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.940
We can do this, Jack.

456
00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:38.140
The Fountain of Youth,
like you always wanted.

457
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.300
Blackbeard. Edward Teach.
The pirate all pirates fear.

458
00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.380
Resurrector of the dead
in his spare time.

459
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.340
He will listen to me.
He listens to no one.

460
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.060
Maybe to his own daughter?

461
00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.740
Daughter as in... beget by?

462
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.180
Long-lost.
Recently found.

463
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.860
Who loves her dear papa
with all her soul.

464
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.660
He bought that?
I sold that.

465
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.820
[footsteps approaching]

466
00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.860
Then it's the Fountain
of Youth for him,

467
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.660
or him and you,
not you and me.

468
00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.220
No, Jack,
that's the best part.

469
00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.060
He will be dead.
Ah.

470
00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.140
You'll be handling
that part yourself, then?

471
00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.940
There is a prophecy.

472
00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.820
Maybe you don't believe
in the supernatural.

473
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.300
Oh, no, no.
I've seen a thing or two.

474
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.340
The prophecy is this:

475
00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.780
Blackbeard will
meet his death within
a fortnight

476
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.820
at the hands
of a one-legged man.

477
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.780
That's why he needs
the Fountain, Jack.

478
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.660
[Barbossa] Oh, Master Gibbs,
short we are a map.

479
00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.100
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to provide us an heading.

480
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.980
Be a gem
and pour me a gulper.

481
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.340
Nay. We be privateers,
not pirates, Master Gibbs.

482
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.940
And in the king's name,
we behave as such.

483
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.700
Aye, Captain.

484
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:35.740
Be we on the
proper course, Gibbs?

485
00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.060
Aye, it be proper.

486
00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.660
There's your proof.

487
00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.540
The Spaniard.

488
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.940
All hands! Battle stations!
Get to windward!

489
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.740
[man] All hands, windward!
Harden up two points!

490
00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.620
[man] Two points!
Cast loose the cannons!

491
00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.180
Gunners, take posts!
[man] Take position!
Gunners ready, sir!

492
00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:13.340
Out! Thrust!
Await orders.

493
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.820
[man] Steady!

494
00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.780
Guns armed,
awaiting orders, sir.

495
00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.100
Sir. Orders, sir?

496
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.140
He never so much
as turned his head.

497
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.580
The Fountain is the prize.

498
00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.340
It appears we be not
even worth the time
it'd take to sink us.

499
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.380
And now we've fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail!

500
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.700
All hands more sail!

501
00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.060
Ride hard between
wind and tide!

502
00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.540
The topic, gentlemen,
is mutiny.

503
00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.620
Mutiny most foul.

504
00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:14.380
Aye. I signed up to sail
under Jack Sparrow,
not some pretender.

505
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.180
And a lady, at that.
And mention was failed to
be made of this uncanny crew.

506
00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.060
Make my toes curl, they do.

507
00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.660
[swords rattling]
I got 'em. All of 'em.

508
00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.580
[Jack] Well done.
Good lad.

509
00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.100
On to it, then.
Blackbeard.

510
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.100
What are his habits?
Stays mostly to his cabin.

511
00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.580
That's right,
mostly to his cabin.

512
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.020
Yes, but when
he comes out...
He don't really come out.

513
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.700
[all muttering]
He must come out sometime.

514
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.020
Not really, no.
[all muttering]

515
00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.340
Any of you
sail with him before?

516
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.700
No, no. Definitely not.
I've never.

517
00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:53.940
Any of you seen him before?
Not really, no.

518
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.860
Stays to his cabin,
no one sailed with him,

519
00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.340
no one's seen him...

520
00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.500
Good news, gentlemen.
This is not
Blackbeard's ship.

521
00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.660
This is not the
<i>Queen Anne's Revenge.</i>

522
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.620
No, this be the
<i>Queen Anne's Revenge,</i>
right enough.

523
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.980
How do you know?

524
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.860
I've seen the name,
on the back of the ship.

525
00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:21.140
[Jack] Gentlemen, sirs,
fellow conscriptees...

526
00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.460
...you have been
monstrously deceived.

527
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.860
We are decepted, then?
Yes.

528
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.340
You've nay been informed
of a destination.

529
00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.900
Death lies before us

530
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.900
as we sail for the
Fountain of Youth.

531
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.620
[all muttering]
[Jack] It would be
a sorry plight, mates.

532
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.340
Death, for certain.
The garden of
darkened souls.

533
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.260
Untimely our ends will be.
Unless...

534
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.340
...we take the ship.

535
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.940
We take the ship, then. Now!

536
00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.700
[clattering]

537
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.500
Go on, then.
[all yelling]

538
00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.940
Help me, shipmates!
Give it to 'em!

539
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.100
Wake up! It's ours!
Come on!

540
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.500
Get up! Off your backside!
[indistinct shouting]

541
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.020
Get off your fannies!
Take it to them, lads!

542
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.420
Help me! Fight!

543
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.660
Mmm... Jack.

544
00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:37.820
If this is a dream, you can
keep the sword and boots on.

545
00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.780
If it's not...
It's a dream.

546
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.260
[clamoring]

547
00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.540
No, it's not!

548
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.140
I thought I should
give you fair warning,

549
00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.140
we're taking the ship.
[speaks Spanish]

550
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.740
Nothing personal.
[speaking Spanish]

551
00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.540
Think you might be
better off if you just...

552
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.740
[Angelica] Yah!
...stay out of it.

553
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.260
[all yelling]

554
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.060
[grunting]

555
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.900
[growls]

556
00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.660
[roaring]
Boggit.

557
00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.540
[yells]

558
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.500
[yells]

559
00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.580
[man] Wretch!

560
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.740
[yells]

561
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.620
[shouts]

562
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.340
You're either with us
or against us!

563
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.660
I am not with you,
neither am I against you!

564
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.180
Can he do that?

565
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.860
He's religious.
I believe it's required.

566
00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.060
[gasps, panting]

567
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:36.540
Fight to the bitter end,
you cack-handed deck apes!

568
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.060
Take him, men.
Tie him down tight!

569
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.700
[grunting]

570
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.020
The ship is ours!

571
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.900
[sighs]
[wind whistling]

572
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.100
Gentlemen.

573
00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.300
I be placed
in a bewilderment.

574
00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.740
There I were, resting,

575
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:59.140
and upon a sudden, I hear
an ungodly row on deck.

576
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.300
[sword vibrates]

577
00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.620
Sailors abandon their posts

578
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.020
without orders,
without leave.

579
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.660
Men before the mast,

580
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.660
taking the ship
for themselves.

581
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.860
What be that, First Mate?

582
00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.780
Mutiny, Captain.
Again?

583
00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.420
[Angelica] Mutiny!
Aye.

584
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.860
Mutiny.

585
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:32.220
And what fate
befalls mutineers?

586
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.620
Now, we know the answer
to that, do we not?

587
00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.020
Mutineers hang!

588
00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.380
[all shouting]

589
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.340
[shouting]

590
00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.500
[yells]

591
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.460
Whoa!

592
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.100
Captain, I wish
to report a mutiny.

593
00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.100
I can name fingers
and point names.

594
00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.980
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

595
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.900
They are sheep.
You, their shepherd.

596
00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.780
Have I mentioned, sir,
what a lovely daughter
you have?

597
00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:51.100
A fitting last sight
for a doomed soul.
Remember, Father.

598
00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.980
We need him.
If I don't kill
a man every now and then,

599
00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.460
they forget who I am.
[man] Coward!

600
00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.980
Hmm?
They do not forget.

601
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.420
Your crew sees you
for the miscreant you are.

602
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.420
A coward, no matter
how many you slay.

603
00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.900
Twice in one day, I find
myself in a bewilderment.

604
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.980
You are not bewildered,
you are afraid.

605
00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:13.260
You dare not walk the path
of righteousness,
the way of the light.

606
00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.780
No, sir. The truth is it
be much simpler than all that.

607
00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.420
I am a bad man.

608
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.740
That, too.

609
00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.860
I might have to kill
you too, catechist.

610
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.620
No!
All Latin blood
like her mother.

611
00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.460
Father, I beg you.

612
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:31.380
Ah, there I be again,
forgetting why the
missionary is here.

613
00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.980
My daughter
fears for my soul,
or what's left of it.

614
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.260
You truly wish to save me,
my child?

615
00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.980
Every soul can be saved.

616
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.860
Be that true, young cleric?

617
00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.660
Yes. Though you I see
as a bit of a long shot.

618
00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.100
Still, I pray for
every unfortunate soul

619
00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.700
on this hell-bound vessel.

620
00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.820
You disarm me
with your faith.

621
00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:02.500
Eight bells!

622
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.900
Which of you unfortunate
souls stood watch?

623
00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:10.740
I did. I stood watch.
[chuckles] Gunner.

624
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.380
You?

625
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.540
Aye.
[breathes heavily]

626
00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.420
[Blackbeard] Aye.

627
00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:27.420
The cook. Perfect.
Lower the longboat!

628
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.420
Bring her about!

629
00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.420
[ship groans]

630
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.420
Why do you do this?
Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

631
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.860
Our laws allow the Captain
to show leniency.

632
00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.580
I have given this man
a chance to determine
his fate,

633
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.300
a gift not afforded to all.

634
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.060
Oh, you now.

635
00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.180
Chance to show the worth
of your prayers.

636
00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:14.980
Pray he be delivered
from... evil?

637
00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.660
Course made!
Stop. Give that man
a chance. Give yourself a...

638
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.660
[screams]

639
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.580
You know when I feel
closest to our Maker?

640
00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.100
When I see suffering,
pain and anguish.

641
00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.780
That's when the true design
of this world is revealed.

642
00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:03.580
And I see it revealed
when in times of hardship
and tragedy,

643
00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.020
kindness and compassion
are shown to those in need.

644
00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.580
Perhaps you should pray
for him to be unharmed, yes?

645
00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.740
Please, there's
still hope...
Again!

646
00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.980
I actually have no interest
in the Fountain whatsoever,

647
00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.660
so, if your heart is set,

648
00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.580
you may drop me off
anywhere you like.

649
00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.340
That'll be all, Quartermaster.

650
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:38.420
Your words surround you like
fog and make you hard to see.

651
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:42.380
And what of you,
the mighty Blackbeard?

652
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.780
Beheaded they say.
Still, your body swam

653
00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:49.020
three times around your ship,
then climbed back on board.

654
00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.100
And here you are,
running scared.

655
00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.100
Scared.

656
00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.300
To the Fountain.

657
00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.220
[Blackbeard]
The Quartermaster sees
things before they happen.

658
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:03.540
He has
foreseen my death, and so
the fates have spoken.

659
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.140
The threads
of destiny woven.

660
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.340
[Jack] You have a ridiculously
high regard for fate, mate.

661
00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.380
And you?
Me?

662
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:15.620
I'm skeptical
of predicting any future...
which includes me.

663
00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:21.900
It'd be foolish
to battle fate, but I'd be
tempted to cheat it.

664
00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:24.540
I will reach the Fountain.
You will lead me.

665
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.900
That knife will
serve you no better

666
00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.900
than the mutiny
you devised.

667
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:32.980
Mutiny served me well.

668
00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.060
It gained me
an audience with you.

669
00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.140
Oh?
Aye.

670
00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.740
To warn you.

671
00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.060
Regarding your first mate,

672
00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.660
who pretends to be persons
she is not.

673
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:48.700
Do tell.

674
00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.180
She is not your daughter.

675
00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.300
[Blackbeard] You dare
to speak thusly
of my flesh and blood?

676
00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:04.100
[Jack] Sir, the woman
is consummate in
the art of deception.

677
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:08.820
I know.
As I mostly unwittingly
set her on her wicked path.

678
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.300
Though I cannot
claim credit

679
00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:14.100
for her existing abundance
of natural talent.

680
00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.540
Angelica. [inhales]
My beloved daughter,

681
00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.020
the one true good thing
I have done in this life,

682
00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:23.940
and you claim to be the one
who corrupted her?

683
00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:28.100
Sir, what she is
is pure evil.

684
00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.700
More to be feared
than a wild beast.

685
00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.660
Hungry wild beast
with gnashing teeth.

686
00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.380
Vengeful, hungry
from hell beast...

687
00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.060
Father?
Sweetness!

688
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.620
[groans]
[Angelica] No need
to hurt him, Father.

689
00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:46.060
He will help us.
Won't you, Jack?

690
00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:50.460
You see? Even now,
she attends to your welfare,

691
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:53.260
giving lie to the claims
you make of her.

692
00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.180
[grunts]

693
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:05.620
You will lead us
to the Fountain. Yes?

694
00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.100
[Blackbeard]
Put another way.

695
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:12.780
If I do not make it
to the Fountain in time...

696
00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.940
...neither will you.
[fire sizzling]

697
00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.820
I'll have a wee look-see
at those charts

698
00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.900
straight away then, shall I?

699
00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.060
Sir.

700
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.420
Aye?
Captain, sir,

701
00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.740
I am unhappy to
report rumors, sir,

702
00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.300
among the crew,
as to our destination.

703
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.500
Shut your trap and make way.

704
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.340
[sighs]

705
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:49.500
That's the way of it, then.
No disrespect, sir.

706
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:52.700
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.

707
00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.980
Whitecap Bay.

708
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.980
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

709
00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:02.420
And every worthless seaman
fears the name,
and rightly so,

710
00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:04.860
though few know why
or dare to ask.

711
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.620
Be the stories true?

712
00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:08.700
Say what robs you of
your staunch heart, Gibbs,

713
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:12.140
or forever leave it
to the wider fields of fancy.

714
00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.300
Mermaids, Captain.

715
00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.180
Aye. Mermaids.
[crew murmuring]

716
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.500
Sea ghouls,
devil fish, dreadful in
hunger for flesh of man.

717
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.900
Mermaid waters,
that be our path.

718
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.740
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

719
00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.100
as mermaids be given
to take the rest...

720
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:34.540
...to the bone.
[crew chattering]

721
00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.780
Steady! Steady, men!
Find your courage,

722
00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.060
or be ready
to purpose your fear!

723
00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.140
[man] Save yourselves!

724
00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.980
[man] Man overboard!
Nay! A deserter.

725
00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.860
Come about.
Nay!

726
00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:55.020
Gentlemen, I shall not ask
any more of any man than what

727
00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:59.620
that man can deliver,
but I do ask this:
Are we not king's men?

728
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.460
[all quietly] Aye.

729
00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.100
On the king's mission?
[all louder] Aye.

730
00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:08.140
I did not note any fear
in the eyes of the Spanish
as they passed us by.

731
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:10.500
Are we not king's men?
[all shout] Aye!

732
00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:14.460
Aye! Hands all off,
and bear away!

733
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.620
Stave on ahead
to Whitecap Bay!

734
00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:21.700
[man] Bear on, Whitecap Bay!

735
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.700
[man plays up-tempo
guitar music]

736
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:38.020
<i>Hola...</i>
Come. Little drink?

737
00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:41.500
Wine, music, candlelight.

738
00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.580
I think we've traveled down
this road before, Jack.

739
00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:45.860
Yes, we have.

740
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.500
I remember it well.

741
00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:54.580
Winding, twisting and
turning, gyrating, writhing.

742
00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.220
Incessant writhing.

743
00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.540
Do you recall
Saint Dominique?

744
00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:02.500
La Martinique.

745
00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.540
I tried to kill you
in Saint Dominique.

746
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.380
Either or.

747
00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:09.300
Hardly appropriate
for a first mate.

748
00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.900
Was I the first?
I've often wondered.

749
00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:16.900
You can be so charming
when you want something, Jack.

750
00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:19.500
The trick is
finding out what.

751
00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.020
[Jack] The truth,
then, is it?

752
00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.020
Blackbeard has served
his purpose.

753
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.700
You and I can go to
the Fountain together,

754
00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.380
where we shall
bathe one another

755
00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.140
in equal shares of fame

756
00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:34.180
and other assorted
debaucheries.

757
00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:37.140
And I'll tell you
the ritual of the Fountain.

758
00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:40.140
Yes. The profane ritual.

759
00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:41.700
[gasps]

760
00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.740
[inhales deeply]
Can I trust you, Jack?

761
00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:47.220
I need you on my side.

762
00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:49.660
Oh, my dearest Angelica.

763
00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:53.300
You and I are as
thick as thieves, love.

764
00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.980
Tell me the rules.

765
00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:01.300
Water from the
Fountain of Youth.

766
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.500
The shimmering tear
of a mermaid.

767
00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.940
The silver chalices
of Ponce de Leon.

768
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:13.780
Uh-huh?
With these items...

769
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.140
Yes?
With these items,

770
00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:19.700
you may take all the years
of life from another, Jack.

771
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.540
Eh?
You know what that means.

772
00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.420
We cannot go alone,
you and I.

773
00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:29.100
The ritual
requires a victim.

774
00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.940
That is unfortunate.
Yes, it is.

775
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.540
I find my desire for the
Fountain greatly lessened.

776
00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:42.660
But there is something
on board you do want.

777
00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.900
What about Blackbeard?

778
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:53.500
He's in the chart room.
We'll have to be quick.

779
00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.060
[door creaks]

780
00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:05.340
He keeps each ship
as a prize.

781
00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:11.820
You help me, and I
promise you your pick.

782
00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:14.940
Though I think I know
the one you will choose.

783
00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:18.620
[thundering]

784
00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:22.860
The Black Pearl
<i>in a bottle?</i>

785
00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.180
Why is the Black Pearl
<i>in a bottle?</i>

786
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:30.740
[chittering]
[shouts] Oh!

787
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.180
He's even more
annoying in miniature.

788
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:37.820
Do we have a deal, Jack?
Angelica, I know you.

789
00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:41.020
You are not going to steal
the life of some innocent man.

790
00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:43.820
What about the
one-legged man?

791
00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.220
[door creaks]
I need years, Jack.

792
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:53.020
Not for me. For my father.

793
00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:57.980
I am truly the daughter
of Blackbeard.

794
00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:01.180
[inhales] You've fallen
for your own con, love.

795
00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.220
No, he is my father.

796
00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.380
The lies I told you
were not lies.

797
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:08.980
You lied to me
by telling me the truth?

798
00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:12.060
Yes.
That's very good.

799
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.980
May I use that?
I'm sure you will, anyway.

800
00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.820
Of course I will.

801
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.660
So, will you not
give up this quest?

802
00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:23.980
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.

803
00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:28.460
Angelica,
your father, Blackbeard...

804
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.300
...he is evil,

805
00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:33.660
and he will kill you
given the chance.

806
00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.900
He cannot be saved.
And who are you to set

807
00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.780
the limits on redemption?

808
00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.740
You stole years of my life,
Jack. You owe me.

809
00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.700
And you are en route
to getting yourself killed,

810
00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.220
and I am not inclined
to stand by and watch.

811
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:52.860
[man shouting] Whitecap Bay!
[bell ringing]

812
00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:00.780
All hands on deck!
Set to the longboats!

813
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:06.380
[indistinct chatter]
[Blackbeard]
Lay 'em out flat!

814
00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:11.020
No tangles. Make 'em look
pretty for our dainty guests.

815
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:15.460
We're gonna need light.
A lot of light.

816
00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:18.100
Come!

817
00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:44.820
Smell that? Whale oil.
Stuff burns like
a miracle from God.

818
00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:48.780
Can you make it work?
Made by the English.

819
00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:50.260
Let's not get our hopes up.

820
00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.180
[wood creaking]

821
00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:03.380
The old moon in
the arms of the new one.

822
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.060
First of the summer.

823
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.380
Perfect for hunting
a mermaid's tear.

824
00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:24.780
We're doomed. They be drawn
to man-made light.

825
00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:27.860
Sharks?
Worse than sharks, boy.

826
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.220
There'll be mermaids upon us
within the hour,

827
00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.660
you mark my words.
And we're the bait.

828
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:42.500
I heard it said a kiss
from a mermaid protects
a sailor from drowning.

829
00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:46.380
Don't be a fool!
Mermaids are all female, son,

830
00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.980
and lovely
as a dream of heaven.

831
00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:53.340
But when it comes time
to churn butter,
so to speak,

832
00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:55.780
they snatch a sailor
out of a boat

833
00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:58.900
or off the deck of a ship,
have their way,

834
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:04.060
and then the sailors
are pulled to bottom
and drowned and eaten.

835
01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:07.940
Or, sometimes,
the other way around.

836
01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.900
[Gunner] Sing.
What?

837
01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.420
They like to hear singing.

838
01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:23.300

[grunts]
You'll scare her off!

854
01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.380
Aye, and good riddance!

855
01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.580
Can you talk?

856
01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.220
Yes.

857
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.060
You're beautiful.

858
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:58.100
Are you the one who sings?
[Scrum] Aye.

859
01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:03.460
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

860
01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:05.140
[chuckles]

861
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:08.300
Aye, that I be.
Scrum, comport yourself!

862
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.780
Boys! There ain't much
been given to me

863
01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.180
in my brief, miserable life,

Well done, sailor.

940
01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.300
Did everyone see that?

941
01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.540
Because I will not
be doing it again.

942
01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:31.300
Back to the ship. We head
for a protected cove. Now.

Give up this madness now.
I cannot.

Ever walk on the beach,

948
01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.220
look back and see your
footsteps in the sand?

949
01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:02.980
It's like that, except
the footsteps lie before me.

950
01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:07.420
Footstep, actually.
Whitecap Bay, sir.

951
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.940
We must hasten.

Gibbs, I require a heading.

954
01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.780
But, sir, the men.
They be dead already.

955
01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:27.300
They don't sound dead.
Oh, is that so?

956
01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:31.180
Well, I hear nothing
but seagulls nesting.

957
01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.820
What is it that you hear,
Mr. Groves?

[men continue shrieking]

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:43.500
Nothing more.
Heading, Gibbs?

[wood creaking]
[screaming continues]

Your head or my heading.

964
01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.180

I don't care which.

967
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:25.740
It's to you now, Sparrow.
Was that really necessary?

968
01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:28.380
Best you not know the exact
whereabouts of my ship.

969
01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:32.220
I be a cautious man.
So be I.

970
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.100
What I want first...

971
01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.260

[birds squawking]

975
01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:19.820
Why is it we've got
to bring her along?

976
01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:22.900
Because tears don't keep.
We need them fresh.

977
01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.060
What is the ritual again?

978
01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.740
Water from the Fountain
and a mermaid's tear?

979
01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.220
And two silver chalices.

980
01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:32.500
One cup with a tear,
one without.

981
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.780
So, one with a tear
and water in both?

982
01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.340
Quite complicated,
is it not?

983
01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.460
Both get water.
One gets a tear.

984
01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:44.300
The person who drinks
the water with the tear

985
01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:46.980
gets all the years
of life from the other.

986
01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:50.860
How many years? Whoa.

987
01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:54.780
All the years
that they have lived,

988
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:58.980
and they could have lived,
if fate had been kinder.

989

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.820
Clergyman.

991
01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:13.860
On the off chance that this
does not go well for me,

992
01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:15.700
I would like it noted
here and now

993
01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:18.700
that I am fully prepared
to believe in whatever I must,

994
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.860
so that I may be
welcomed into that place

995
01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:23.340
where all the goody-goodies
get to go. Savvy?

996
01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:27.300
We have
a word for that, Jack.
You can convert.

997
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:29.660
I was thinking more
of an as-needed basis.

998
01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.980
[gasping]

999
01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:35.100
Quartermaster!

1000
01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.340
Aye?
She cannot breathe!

1001
01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:40.380
She has water.
She needs air!

1002
01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:46.940
Open this.
She will escape.

1003
01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:50.380
You're killing her.
I support the
missionary's position.

1004
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.900
[laughs]

1005
01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:53.100

[panting]

1008
01:13:58.780 --> 01:13:59.940
See?

1009
01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.300
Onward.

1010
01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:34.380
Just as I thought.
Not this way!

1011
01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.980
This is the way,
isn't it?

1012
01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.780
'Course it is,
but we should go
around to the east.

1013
01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.020
That would take us out of
the path of the chalices.

1014
01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.140
Well, then
we'll circle back.
There is no time.

1015
01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:46.740
You're the one
who insisted on bringing
the bloody mermaid.

1016
01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:48.780
Well, the mutiny
didn't help.
You walk like a girl.

1017
01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:51.020
You would know.
Someone must go.

1018
01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:53.500
You mean split up?

1019
01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:56.380
You mean jump?
This I cannot wait to see.

1020
01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:00.460
Sparrow will go.
Find the ship,
retrieve the chalices.

1021
01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:02.700
Sparrow? What makes you
think he will come back?

1022
01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:06.100
Yes, what makes you think
he will come back?

1023
01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.580
We cannot trust him, Father.
I'll go.

1024
01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.580
She'll go.

1025
01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.900
How much farther
to the Fountain?

1026
01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.020
I'm running out of time.

1027
01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.860
About a day's march north,
following that river,

1028
01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.780
you'll get to
a series of pools.
Then you're close.

1029
01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:30.100
You will go.

1030
01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.980
I was sure
it would come to this.

1031
01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:50.740
You know that feeling
you get sometimes

1032
01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:52.900
when you're standing
in a high place?

1033
01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.100
Sudden urge to jump?

1034
01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:58.340
I don't have it.

1035
01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:01.660
[gun cocks]
I need those chalices.

1036
01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:04.300
Shoot. Save me
the bother of the fall.

1037
01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:06.820
You will go.
You will return...

1038
01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.660
...or I will kill her.

1039
01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.180
You won't kill
your own daughter.

1040
01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:18.060
Quartermaster,
get me six more pistols,

1041
01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:19.820
remove the shot
from all but two,

1042
01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:21.780
but do not
tell me which two.

1043
01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:27.260
You get to choose,
Mr. Sparrow.
Oh.

1044
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:34.380
No. Mmm... No.

1045
01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:40.380
Yes.
You're sure?

1046
01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:41.860
'Course I am.

1047
01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:47.900
[gun clicks]

1048
01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:51.460
Again.

1049
01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.420
Please,
they're not even loaded.
[all gasp]

1050
01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:57.820
[all gasp]

1051
01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:01.500
Again.

1052
01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:04.220
If you're so keen
on killing her,

1053
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:06.820
why don't you just
let her jump?
What?

1054
01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:09.980
Mm-mm!
If you jump and die,

1055
01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:12.620
then she will
have her chance. 

1056
01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.060
Again.

1057
01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:23.980
Oi... if I jump,
will I survive?

1058
01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.380
The doll.

1059
01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.980
[chanting in foreign language]

1060
01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:41.300
[Jack screaming]

1061
01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:42.620
[doll splashes in water]

1062
01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:49.700
Yes, now you will survive.
This is nonsense! I'm going!

1063
01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:55.420
[screaming]

1064
01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.380
[gasps]

1065
01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:11.180
Wet. Wet again.

1066
01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:16.940
[Quartermaster] We go on.
Due north to the Fountain.

1067
01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:18.940
Well played, Father.

1068
01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:22.780
You knew which guns
were loaded, right?

1069
01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:27.060
Of course, my love.

1070
01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:40.020
Be nice to have
a map about now.

1071
01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:42.300
Or a ship.
[crickets chittering]

1072
01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:46.460
Stop!
Hold very still.

1073
01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.940
Ye dare not let it
touch your skin.

1074
01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:03.180
What? What be wrong with
an older man having a hobby?

1075
01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:06.100
What are you
stopping for, eh?
Push on!

1076
01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.340
Push on!
You can sleep
when you're dead. Push on!

1077
01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:14.700
Fortune continues
to favor us.

1078
01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.660
The <i>Santiago.

1079
01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:47.260
Famously captained
by Ponce de Leon.

1080
01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:51.340
Oh. There's no one there.

1081
01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:52.620
Right, then.

1082
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.780
[seagulls crying]

1083
01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:05.700
[glass shatters]

1084
01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:24.140
[panting]

1085
01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:28.620
We must not stop.

1086
01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:31.980
[gasps]

1087
01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:38.060
You will walk.

1088
01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:59.300
[grunts] I cannot.

1089
01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:01.580
Walk or die.

1090
01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:09.540
Put your arms around me.

1091
01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:12.860
I do not ask for help.
But you need it.

1092
01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:34.220
We're in a hurry, yes?
Do not fall behind.

1093
01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:55.540
Hold here till I say!

1094
01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.900
Such beauty.

1095
01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:13.420
Surely you're one of
God's own creations,

1096
01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:17.100
and not a descendant
of those dark creatures

1097
01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:18.900
who found
no refuge on the Ark.

1098
01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:23.220
Such beauty...

1099
01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:26.940
...and yet deadly.

1100
01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.540
Deadly? No.

1101
01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:31.500
You attacked me.

1102
01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:36.500
No. You are different.

1103
01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:38.700
Different?

1104
01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:42.020
Are you not? You protect.

1105
01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:47.220
[mutters] Did you...?

1106
01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:51.220
You pushed me down
out of the way.

1107
01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:57.260
You see the Fountain?
No, but we are close.

1108
01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.820
Bring the creature.
Cover its head.

1109
01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:01.820
She has a name!

1110
01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:07.860
Pray tell.

1111
01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:15.740
She is Syrena.

1112
01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:23.100
[grunting]

1113
01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:45.740
[grunts]

1114
01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:56.340
[wood creaking]
[wind whistling]

1115
01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.780
Ponce de Leon.

1116
01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:06.060
[Barbossa] If 40 pirates
dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

1117
01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:09.660
it would not match
the contents of this room.

1118
01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:11.340
You.

1119
01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.860
You.
No...

1120
01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:19.380
...you.
I was here first.

1121
01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:23.540
You, why are you here?
Blackbeard sent me.

1122
01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.180
Why are you?
Silver chalices

1123
01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:29.620
for my royal liege.
Oh, please.

1124
01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:33.020
Back, back! We have
to balance it out!

1125
01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:37.180
The whole ship will slide!

1126
01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:41.980
Right, then.

1127
01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:48.620
What if we each choose
an item of approximately
equal weight?

1128
01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:52.740
Put it back!

1129
01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.060
We touch nothing!

1130
01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.740
[objects rattling]

1131
01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:05.780
What about that?

1132
01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:07.380
The chalices.

1133
01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:11.540
Oi! Why do you
get to look first?

1134
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:12.780
Fine, then.

1135
01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:18.300
[ship groaning]
[grunts]

1136
01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:25.260
[grunts]

1137
01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.380
[both] Together.

1138
01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:37.340
[Jack] Rocks.

1139
01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:39.860
The Spanish.

1140
01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:42.300
They're ahead of us, mate.

1141
01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:44.820
I shall have
a look at that map.

1142
01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:46.780
If it's what I fear...

1143
01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:50.820
[grunts]

1144
01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:54.220
[mutters indistinctly]
[coin tinkles]

1145
01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:58.460
I wonder why they
left this behind.

1146
01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:05.460
[whispering]
Don't touch the map.

1147
01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:08.260
Oh.

1148
01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:12.260
They know the path,

1149
01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:16.180
but I can also see where
they'll most likely make camp.

1150
01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.300
[Gibbs] Jack!
Shh!

1151
01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:37.300
Gibbs, I was just on me way
to break you out of jail.

1152
01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:41.380
Hmm.
You stole my map.

1153
01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:44.540
Oh!
Right. Best be started.

1154
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.820
Ole.

1155
01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:08.300
[Blackbeard] Mermaids.

1156
01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:13.740
Careful, these pools run deep.

1157
01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:17.540
If she escapes, all is lost.
Quartermaster.

1158
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:22.700
[hissing]
[Blackbeard] Look. Look!

1159
01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:27.460
Staked out to die,
to dry in the sun.

1160
01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:30.620
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live,

1161
01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:35.140
but just enough to make
the dying slow.

1162
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:37.380
Think on it.

1163
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.940
Your people, murdered,
harvested for their tears.

1164
01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:45.340
Syrena, won't you cry?

1165
01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:48.100
All die, even you.

1166
01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:51.540
Soon, I hear.
Listen...

1167
01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.460
[hisses]
Listen.

1168
01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:59.100
Can you not hear
your sisters scream?

1169
01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:02.300
[faint shrieks]
Do you not hear them?

1170
01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.980
We need but one tear.

1171
01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:09.540
[gasps]
Vile creature!

1172
01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:12.300
Chop off her fingers,
one by one!
Choke her!

1173
01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:14.780
[man] Cut out the tears
from behind the eyes!

1174
01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.780
Where's your voice in this?

1175
01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.020
Maybe she'll have
a change of heart

1176
01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:20.620
when the sun rises.

1177
01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:23.180
Oh, aye,
she will burn,

1178
01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.660
but I cannot
wait for the sun.

1179
01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.420
Perhaps we should
build a fire.

1180
01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:28.540
No.
Do not contest me, cleric.

1181
01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:31.700
You will not torture her.
We need only one tear.

1182
01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:35.180
I will tear every scale
from her body one by one
if I see fit.

1183
01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:37.140
If that displeases you,
go pray.

1184
01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:40.180
I was wrong. Not every soul
can be saved. Yours cannot.

1185
01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:43.100
Behold, gentlemen,
a man formerly of faith.

1186
01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.700
That vile creature,
as you call her,

1187
01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.100
is worth
a hundred of you.

1188
01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:47.540
Oh, you care for her?

1189
01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.020
You fancy her.

1190
01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:57.020
And do not deny what is
clear to my eyes.

1191
01:28:57.940 --> 01:28:59.380
Question is...

1192
01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:04.500
...does she fancy you?

1193
01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:10.780
By God, she does.
We are in luck!

1194
01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:14.860
Bring forth a tear...

1195
01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:17.660
...or witness the death
of this poor soul.

1196
01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:19.820
[grunts, gasps]
[hisses]

1197
01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:23.300
Syrena, if you could
manage a tear,

1198
01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:24.780
I would be grateful.

1199
01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:28.100
Sadness, yes,

1200
01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:33.620
but no sorrow... yet.
Not by your hand, Father!

1201
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:36.540
Time and tide wait for none.
Quartermaster.

1202
01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:39.500
[grunt]
[pained cry]

1203
01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:51.660
Ooh, aye,
mermaids are tough.

1204
01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:53.940
The lot of them.

1205
01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:58.340
Tie her up like the others.
And get rid of this.

1206
01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:00.900
[Syrena struggling]

1207
01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:05.740
You are confident?
Yes.

1208
01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:09.540
I am a woman.
So is she.

1209
01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.340
[grunting]

1210
01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:20.420
[Gibbs]
What's your play, Jack?
Throwing in with Barbossa.

1211
01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:23.020
There is a girl...

1212
01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.780
...a female...
of the opposite sex.

1213
01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:30.700
When is there not?
Perhaps I should
say "damsel."

1214
01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:33.900
You're rescuing a damsel?
Well, there's a first.

1215
01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:37.180
Yes, but it's just that
I may have caused said damsel

1216
01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:39.020
some manner of harm
many moons ago.

1217
01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.620
Out with it.

1218
01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:44.740
Gibbs, this is
the woman from Seville.

1219
01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:47.020
Ah, you pretended
to love her,

1220
01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.620
then you left her
and broke her heart.

1221
01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:53.060
Worse. I may have had,
briefly, mind you...

1222
01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:58.100
...stirrings.
Stirrings?

1223
01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:02.540
Stirrings.
What? Like feelings,
you mean?

1224
01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:06.100
No, no, no.
Not quite all the way
to feelings. More like...

1225
01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:11.900
All right,
feelings, damn you.

1226
01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:16.220
And you left her still.
Ooh, that's low.

1227
01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:19.380
Thank you.

1228
01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:22.380
[branch snaps]
Shh!

1229
01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:27.660
Stealth over force.

1230
01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:31.100
I'll take it from here
on account of your condition.

1231
01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:34.140
You don't have
termites, do you?

1232
01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:36.780
I appreciate
your concern, Jack,

1233
01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:39.140
but I'll be keeping
you company all the same.

1234
01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:42.540
Hold here,
Lieutenant Commander.
Wait for my signal.

1235
01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.940
[indistinct chattering]

1236
01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:14.340
[indistinct chatter]

1237
01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.700
[Barbossa] There. That one.
That be the leader.

1238
01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:19.540
Make note of his tent
because that's where...

1239
01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:24.460
No, wait. By God,
that must be them
right there.

1240
01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:30.860
[sniffing]
Your sword smells funny.

1241
01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:35.700
Aye. Poison from the
innards of poisonous toads.

1242
01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:39.180
Just a scratch,
you're a dead man in minutes.

1243
01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:41.340
Would you mind pointing it
the other way?

1244
01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:42.780
I don't like toads.

1245
01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:49.500
What are you doing?

1246
01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:51.740
Planning an escape route.

1247
01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:53.420
Isn't that how you do it?

1248
01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.020
Yes.

1249
01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:59.340
Or sometimes I just...
improvise.

1250
01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:27.540
Now what?

1251
01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:31.020
We stroll out,
slow and steady.

1252
01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:32.820
Just like we belong.

1253
01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:46.020
[all grunting]
[swords clanging]

1254
01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:08.660
[guns cocking]

1255
01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:17.020
[groaning]

1256
01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:28.700
[animal chirping nearby]

1257
01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.220
[footsteps approaching]

1258
01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:33.900
[panting] I'm sorry, Syrena.

1259
01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:37.020
Philip, you're alive.

1260
01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:38.220
Yes.

1261
01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:40.460
You came for me.

1262
01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:43.980
Why?

1263
01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:48.820
You're different,
are you not?

1264
01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:54.700
Do you know not of kindness?
Compassion?

1265
01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:02.340
[grunting, yelling]

1266
01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:14.380
Tears of sorrow, never.

1267
01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:16.900
Mermaids be
too tough for that.

1268
01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:18.980
But tears of joy...

1269
01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:23.500
They say these be
the more potent anyway.

1270
01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:25.820
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.

1271
01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.180
Let her go.
You don't need her now.

1272
01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:32.180
Let her go? No.

1273
01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:35.100
Secure her bonds.
We leave her with her own.

1274
01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:47.300
[Jack] How's that
escape route working?

1275
01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:49.500
Here's your chance
to improvise.

1276
01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:51.660
I'm attempting it.

1277
01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:54.460
I might be able to get
a hand loose.

1278
01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.900
Oh, you got a knife.
That's very good.

1279
01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.140
Better.

1280
01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:02.780
[liquid sloshing]

1281
01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:06.220
I want one of those.

1282
01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:14.580
Here's to revenge.
Sweet and clear.

1283
01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:16.900
Revenge?

1284
01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:19.220
Come, come, Hector.

1285
01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:21.220
If you wanted
the chalices,

1286
01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:23.300
you'd seen they were
missing and gone.

1287
01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:27.420
You were lying in wait,
for Blackbeard.

1288
01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:29.420
Oh?

1289
01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:32.620
King George.
Privateer. Wig.

1290
01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:36.260
Cheap theatrical facade.
I'm not buying it.

1291
01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:38.340
You weren't there that night.

1292
01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:39.820
When the <i>Pearl</i> was lost?

1293
01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:42.380
Taken, not lost.

1294
01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:46.420
We were off the coast
of Hispaniola when

1295
01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.900
we came under attack.
<i>[ship creaking]</i>

1296
01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:52.300
No provocation nor warning
nor offer of parley.

1297
01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:55.180
We were peppered
with cannon fire.

1298
01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:56.380
<i>[shots firing]</i>

1299
01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:59.620
And then the sea beneath
the <i>Pearl</i> began to roil.

1300
01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.260
<i>[sea roiling]</i>

1301
01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:03.780
The <i>Pearl</i> was pitching
and yawing violently.

1302
01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:05.500
Every plank, every rail,

1303
01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:08.620
every spar, all at once,
began to creak.

1304
01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:11.540
The rigging had come to life.
<i>[ship creaking]</i>

1305
01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:14.380
Our own ship
turned against us...

1306
01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:18.020
...tangling the crew,
wrapping around 'em
like snakes.

1307
01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:20.100
And wrapping around me leg.

1308
01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.300
But me arms were free
and me sword was to hand.

1309
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:26.540
I am the master of me ship,
not Blackbeard.

1310
01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:30.620
I am the master of my fate,
not Blackbeard.

1311
01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:34.140
So I did what needed done.

1312
01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:42.620
I survived.

1313
01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:48.540
So... you're not
after the Fountain.

1314
01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:52.340
I care not for King George
or tavern yarns

1315
01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:54.580
that give hope
for a healed limb.

1316
01:37:55.900 --> 01:38:00.020
But I'd give my left arm
for a chance at Blackbeard.

1317
01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.060
Not your right?
I need me good arm

1318
01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:07.900
to drive my poisoned blade
through his heart.

1319
01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:11.260
I'll see you get
the chance, mate.

1320
01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:26.940
[soft grunting]

1321
01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:37.740
[indistinct chatter
in Spanish]

1322
01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:57.780
[tree creaking]
[wind whistling]

1323
01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:19.260
[creaking]

1324
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:31.340
The prisoner's escaping.

1325
01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:38.020
[grunting]

1326
01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.460
He's escaping!
Fan out! Find him!

1327
01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.460
Go! Go!
[gunfire]

1328
01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:47.780
Hold your fire!
I want him alive!

1329
01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:51.380
[shouting in Spanish]

1330
01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:57.460
I figured
that was the signal.

1331
01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:16.900
[men yelling]

1332
01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:25.260
[men shouting]

[men shouting in Spanish]

1334
01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:42.340
Go! Prepare to move out!

1335
01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.900
The enemy is soon upon us.

1336
01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:47.580
I'm sorry about
the chalices, Jack,

1337
01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:48.940
but I've an
appointment to keep.

1338
01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:50.220
I'll not be going back.

1339
01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:51.540
No need.

1340
01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.540
Shall we have a drink?

1341
01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:55.140
We'll drink at the Fountain.

1342
01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:08.620
[birds chirping]

1343
01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:13.580
[gasps]

1344
01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:15.580
How is it we can never meet

1345
01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:17.660
without you pointing
something at me?

1346
01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:20.380
You brought the chalices,
Sparrow?

1347
01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:22.700
Aye. Oi!

1348
01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:26.380
[pig oinking]

1349
01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:29.180
[Angelica] I see you
brought a friend.
[Jack] I did.

1350
01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:33.100
And the one-legged man,
he is near. Aye?

1351
01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.180
Aye.

1352
01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:38.100
Now... Before I go
just handing them over,

1353
01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:39.500
I do have one
or two conditions.

1354
01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:41.180
Name them.
Firstly,

1355
01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:43.020
I'll be having
me compass back.

1356
01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:44.460
No, no,
that's secondly.

1357
01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:46.460
Firstly, upon your word,

1358
01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:48.660
you will bring
no harm to Angelica.

1359
01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.180
[Blackbeard] I'll make
no vows to the likes
of you, Sparrow.

1360
01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:54.220
But it costs me
nothing to admit

1361
01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:56.660
that she was never
in harm's way.

1362
01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:59.260
Secondly then,
priorly firstly,

1363
01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:01.260
I will be having
me compass back.

1364
01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:04.220
Please? I do deserve it.

1365
01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:05.940
Do you have any idea
how difficult it was

1366
01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:07.300
to catch that filthy pig?

1367
01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:10.300
Not the big one,
the four-legged one.

1368
01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:17.660
Thank you.
And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

1369
01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:20.500
there are times,
not very often,

1370
01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:23.740
when I do reflect
upon my heinous misdeeds.

1371
01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:28.140
Chief among them,
I note how poorly I have
treated Mr. Gibbs,

1372
01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:29.420
my loyal first mate.

1373
01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.380
Aye! Now you bring it up...

1374
01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:33.780
Left him to rot in jail,
I did. Didn't care.

1375
01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:38.260
Still don't. But, point being,
you must let him go free.

1376
01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:41.340
Is that it?

1377
01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:43.420
I think so.

1378
01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:46.500
Quick, or the pig runs,
and good luck getting
those chalices.

1379
01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:48.140
Jack, if it's all the same
to you, I'd be just as...

1380
01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:48.980
Done.

1381
01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:50.860
Release the swine.

1382
01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.180
[squealing]

1383
01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:58.100
Perhaps, if you don't mind,

1384
01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:00.260
I could tag along

02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:53.380
[Jack] There's no
trusting you, love.

1562
02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:56.020
Besides, this is
a well-traveled trade route.

1563
02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:57.860
You can signal a passing ship.

1564
02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:01.260
Or you can just
bite the proverbial
bullet, as it were.

1565
02:03:01.660 --> 02:03:03.860
And how will I get free
of these bonds?

1566
02:03:03.940 --> 02:03:05.980
You broke free of your bonds
half an hour ago,

1567
02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:08.500
waiting for the precise
moment to pounce.

1568
02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:13.180
Admit it, Jack.

1569
02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:14.860
You still love me.

1570
02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:17.500
If you had a sister
and a dog,

1571
02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:19.580
I'd choose the dog.

1572
02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:23.700
Treasure! There is
a chest with jewels!

1573
02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:26.020
Jewels with the power
to rule the wind and tide!

1574
02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:27.220
You're making that up!

1575
02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:30.260
Wait... [panting]

1576
02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:33.500
I am with child. Yours.

1577
02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:36.260
I don't recall
that we ever had...

1578
02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:37.220
You were drunk!

1579
02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:39.140
I've actually
never been that drunk.

1580
02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:40.500
Wait!

1581
02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:44.340
There is something
I want to say to you.

1582
02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:48.620
Something I wanted to say
from the moment we first met.

1583
02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:50.740
Go on, then.

1584
02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:54.500
I love you.

1585
02:03:57.820 --> 02:03:59.380
As do I.

1586
02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:03.500
Always have.
Always will.

1587
02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:09.220
I gotta go.

1588
02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:10.460
Jack!

1589
02:04:12.620 --> 02:04:14.420
This is not over!

1590
02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:16.540
Jack!

1591
02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:25.220
[gunshot]
[water splashes]

1592
02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:27.340
Missed!

1593
02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:31.020
[Angelica screaming
in Spanish]

1594
02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:45.820
The <i>Revenge</i> is mine.

1595
02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:54.060
Sir...

1596
02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:58.500
We found this
below decks.

1597
02:05:06.380 --> 02:05:08.060
[sword vibrating]

1598
02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:20.060
[men yelling]

1599
02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:27.020
All hands!
Ply to windward!

1600
02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:30.060
Get cracking,
ye blooming cockroaches!

1601
02:05:30.140 --> 02:05:33.180
[cackling]
[all laughing]

1602
02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:36.060
The Crown served me well.

1603
02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:38.820
But now, by the gods
of sea and sky...

1604
02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:42.620
...make way for Tortuga!

1605
02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:44.660
[men shouting]

1606
02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:57.380
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted
shellback, you made it!

1607
02:05:57.460 --> 02:05:58.820
[Gibbs] Aye!

1608
02:05:58.900 --> 02:06:00.820
And I trust
we managed a profit

1609
02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:02.740
from our joint enterprise?

1610
02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:05.220
Feast your eyes.

1611
02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:12.780
The compass led me
straight and true.

1612
02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:15.060
What of Blackbeard's men
guarding the ship?

1613
02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:18.380
I employed the selfsame
maneuver we perfected
in New Guinea.

1614
02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:19.100
Oh.

1615
02:06:19.180 --> 02:06:22.900
Seemed a shame to leave
an entire fleet behind.

1616
02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:25.500
Shame indeed.
[chuckles]

1617
02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:36.180
[bird squawking]
[squealing]

1618
02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:38.620
I hate that monkey.

1619
02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:39.740
So, the <i>Pearl...

1620
02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:41.900
Any idea how
to get her out?

1621
02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:45.340
We shall need a crossbow,
an hourglass, three goats.

1622
02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:48.660
One of us must learn to
play the trumpet whilst the
other one goes like this...

1623
02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:50.220
I know a man with a goat.

1624
02:06:50.380 --> 02:06:52.380
Good. I can go like this.

1625
02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:56.700
[Gibbs] Jack,
I have to ask...

1626
02:06:56.780 --> 02:06:59.420
You had the chalices,
the water, the tear...

1627
02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:02.500
You could have lived
maybe forever.

1628
02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:04.380
[Jack] The Fountain
does test you, Gibbs.

1629
02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:07.140
But better to not know
which moment may be your last.

1630
02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:09.620
Every morsel
of your entire being

1631
02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:12.620
alive to the infinite
mystery of it all.

1632
02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:15.500
And who's to say
I won't live forever, eh?

1633
02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:19.340
Discoverer of the
Fountain of Youth.
[chuckling]

1634
02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:21.980
[Jack] I have
no say in it, Gibbs.

1635
02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:23.980
It's a pirate's life for me.

1636
02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:26.380
Savvy?

1637
02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:40.580
[gulls crying]

1638
02:16:04.060 --> 02:16:05.900
[thunder rumbling]

1639
02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:11.220
[thunder cracks]
