ride the dragon or what?

172
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:52,078
No no, we already did this.

173
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:55,547
Naw, Choga never forgets a tongue girl.

174
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:57,950
Let's not bother the nice lady, Choga.

175
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:03,322
- Hi Bo. Happy Yule.
- Armpits is half price.

176
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:08,060
Thanks... Bruce.
Again.

177
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:22,140
Yo! Valkyrie lips!
What was that?

178
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:24,910
You actually remember!
I'm not alone! I can't believe this.

179
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:26,111
What is going on?

180
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:30,315
In about three seconds
Fugly over there calls

181
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:31,883
Brunette by the wrong name.

182
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:35,820
You're so hot, Christie.

183
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:37,655
[slap]

184
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:41,059
- That's not my name.
- Oh, Carrie.

185
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:42,693
[slap]

186
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:46,531
- It's Jeanette.
- I was way off.

187
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:49,333
Lady Roids makes it about
two more sips before...

188
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:53,070
<i>[cheering and chanting 'chug']</i>

189
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:54,972
[burps]

190
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,507
Fire in the hole.

191
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:59,811
Oh good god,
 I can smell that from here.

192
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:03,080
She's a Sasquatch.
She probably ate like a hundred kittens.

193
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:03,981
And...duck.

194
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,782
[smack]

195
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,351
I said duck.

196
00:12:07,385 --> 00:12:09,686
How long have you been doing
Groundhog Day?

197
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,423
And haven't you tried telling anyone?

198
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:15,025
Like, oh my gosh...
I didn't even think about that

199
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,260
like a hundred times!

200
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:19,395
Hey you, I know this is gonna
sound crazy but we are stuck

201
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,897
in some sort of quantum paradox

202
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:23,166
the same night keeps
repeating over and over again.

203
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,535
[laughs]
Yule Fools!

204
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,805
Thanks asshat, and good
luck with that rash.

205
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,241
- What?
- You'll find out.

206
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:39,215
No matter who I tell I get the
same reaction. Over and over.

207
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:42,352
Nothing...
Until you and I kissed.

208
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:45,485
Mmm.

209
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:55,731
- Nada.
- Speak for yourself.

210
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:00,068
Anyway. Maybe you need to
do it with someone you have a

211
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:02,338
connection with. Have you
talked to Lauren or Dyson...

212
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:05,374
You mean the same people that
left me in the car, alone?

213
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,976
Besides I already went upstairs.
They're being weird with Vex.

214
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:10,312
And Kenzi hasn't even
come to check on me.

215
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:14,283
[chuckles] Please, that girl's
stuck from Hale to Eternity.

216
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:16,351
Besides, for them it's
just party as usual.

217
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:19,054
They are not stuck in the loop.
Say opa.

218
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:23,858
- What?
- Three-two-one...

219

gets better and better...

223
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,913

<i>Oh yeah!
We can drink to that.</i>

225
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:55,957

- Bruce. ...Bruce?

00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,725
Yo, whatchyou calling
that meat mountain for?

227
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,025
He can't fill your prescription!

You know what... screw it. I am
calling time out on hel shoes,

230
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:10,637
on being Dark, all of it.
Everyone here is having fun.

231
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:13,039
Now it is my turn. 
Starting with him.

232
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:16,009
Oh yeah, I got to him
about fifteen repeats ago.

233
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:20,546
Well that settles it.
Time to get our Yule on.

235
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:26,452

<i>Woohoo!</i>

- Here? In front of everybody?
- Oh they won't remember.

240
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:50,342
Besides: tell me this
wasn't on your list.

<i>To commence the annual Yule
drinking game we shall drink</i>

244
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:05,056
to decide whether or not we
tell Bo about the box. Agreed?

245
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,692
- Agreed.
- Pros.

246
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:12,363
Okay, well Bo is always
very big on the truth.

247
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:13,665
True.

248
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:18,202
Cons.

249
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:21,372
Cons: We may lose Bo to the big
locomotive in the sky forever.

250
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,874
Well as somebody who knows
Bo beyond her rack size

251
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:26,177
- and underwear line...
- Oo, burn!

252
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:30,014
I think that the best course
of action is some caution.

253
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:33,384
Because although I love her,
you know she is sometimes

254
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,519
a very sexy bull in a China shop.

255
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:38,956
Well as someone who sacrificed
his love to save Bo's life...

256
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,758
Oh, wow god, really.
Boring.

257
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,910
- Hi.
- ...rather than lying to her

258
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:44,628
- countless times...
- Wow.

259
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:45,859
- Mm-hmm.
- A-mazing!

260
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:48,749
Let me just say that I've learned
that Bo can handle herself.

261
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:52,019
And it is never a good idea to
get in the way of Bo's destiny.

262
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:55,856
Oh, should I tell Bo ...
Bo doesn't love me ...

263
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:59,426
Come on, let's figure out what
to do with the mystery package

264
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,062
and settle the enigma of
the most boring threesome

265
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:06,066
ever once and for all!
Present your cases to me!

266
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,436
And I shall deliberate!

267
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,304
What do you think?

268
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,673
I probably think the opposite
of whatever you think.

269
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,809
Granted. But you realize we're
about to listen to Vex. Right?

270
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:19,179
Who is sorts kinda Bo's pet now.

271
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,781
C'mon now.
Come to Team Vex.

272
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:28,888
Where yee shall be judged,
most worthy of Bo's box.

Round and round we go 
where she stops nobody knows.

275
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,871
Kenzi was pretty bummed when you left.

276
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:50,943
Yeah I just needed to find my kind.
Other Valkyries.

277
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:56,162
- Find myself, if you will.
- Did you?

278
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:59,718
- I have a lot to amend for.
- Oh. Who doesn't.

279
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,756
Happy Yule, Valkryie.

280
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,496
Bo, there's something I
need to talk to you about...

281
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,402
Well that's new.

282
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,667
- And definitely bad.
- Opa?

283
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:26,713
[seasonal jingle playing] 

284
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:31,205
Holy shit.  

285
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:38,394
Good, stick together.

286
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:40,947
S'up s'up.
You got the disease, Choga...

287
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:42,482
You think Mama Choga wanted you

288
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:45,419
to leave the lilypad to
be a sweat peddler? Huh?

289
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:49,189
You're better than this!
And stay away from the walls!

290
00:17:49,824 --> 00:17:53,593
Okay, I have looked everywhere.
Grey-hair McCutie is gone.

291
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:55,628
Okay, well whatever took
him must have something

292
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:57,130
to do with the time shifts.

293
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:59,665
Okay, you think this has
something to do with me?

294
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,468
Because everything terrible 'round
here usually has to do with me.

295
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,337
No. Chill.
Tamsin, okay?

296
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:06,639
Has anyone else gone missing
since you've been here?

297
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:10,008
I don't know. I just thought
everyone got drunk and took off.

298
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:11,176
Bruce.

299
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:13,879
He was here, helping me lift
amphibian-arms out of my way.

300
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:14,880
And now he's...gone.

301
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:16,915
Yeah, but like Bruce
is like gamma ray huge!

302
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,419
- What or who could of...
- Suck him into a walls?

303
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:23,756
Okay, tell me everything you
remember before you got to the party.

304
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,258
<i>Did you piss off a wizard or
something along your travels?</i>

305
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:29,527
No, no I took the 43 bus,
got off at the gas station,

306
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:32,597
I got a pack of gum, and I
came straight here. I swear.

307
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:35,100
Okay, well we need to
stop this thing before it

308
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,870
- snatches someone else.
- Ok, um... How?

309
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:40,372
I don't know. Normally in
these situations I just ask...

310
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:41,573
<i>Both: Trick!</i>

311
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:44,676
He should be easy to find he's
wearing one helluva a sweater.

312
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:50,448
First time I saw Bo?
I knew she was special.

313
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:53,017
- And trouble.
- No argument here.

314
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:55,052
Mm-hmm.

315
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:56,487
Amen.

316
00:18:56,521 --> 00:19:02,164
But if I hadn't been there
to give her the old Wolf-Chi

317
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:04,495
power up she would not
have survived those trials.

318
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:05,897
Puh-lease.

319
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:09,767
<i>Hahaha, so in a way ... I'm
responsible for her still being here</i>

320
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:14,705
 so I should choose what
to do with her box ... the box.

321
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:18,875
- Objection!
- Nah. No, a point for trying to win.

322
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,646
But minus a point for not noticing
my jubblies in this bra.

323
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:24,080
I'm not playing that game.

324
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:29,519
When I first met Bo she
didn't even know her hole

325
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:32,122
from an ass in the ground.
She was all like...

326
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:35,425
<i>"I'm a killer, get in my way
and I'm gonna kill you...</i>

327
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,360
that's what killers do. "
That's right.

328
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:38,929
And then I curbed her hunger.

329
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:41,698
And then she was like "maybe
I'm okay, I'm not so bad".

330
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:44,467
And I love her also, so
I think that we should

331
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:46,969
just throw the box in
a big old fire, voilá.

332
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:48,971
The Doctor, thank you very much, rests!

333
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:52,442
Agh, Bo gets kidnapped
by mysterious black smoke,

334
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:56,278
sends herself an ominous package ...

335
00:19:56,313 --> 00:20:00,583
- why are we fighting about this?
- I don't know, Dyson.

336
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:04,386
- I don't know anything.
- Neither do I.

337
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:10,059
How is it that even you
love somebody so much and...

338
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:12,261
Let them down?

339
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:20,602
- Exactly.
- Still working on that one too.

340
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,507
[chuckles]
Come here you.

341
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,275
- C'mon Doctor.
- Hah.

342
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,310
Hug it out.

343
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:32,313
Been a long time. Give it
to me. Give me some love.

344
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:33,915
Give me some love.

345
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,651
- Okay.
- Oi...

346
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:41,439
- Okay.
- So what does the genius get,

347
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:43,824
you know, who organized
this little Kumbaya?

348
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:49,463
You ... get your hand
re-attached. By me. Rrright now.

349
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,000
Drunkin' surgery.
I'll be the nurse.

350
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:56,804
- Ou.
- Oo, this is getting kinky...

351
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:57,805
[chuckles]

352
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:03,778
Oh, Trick. Trick, you have no
idea how good it is to see you.

353
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:05,746
You can't prove I did that.

354
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:09,616
Wow. Okay, easy does it.

355
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,886
- How long I been out?
- What is the last thing you remember?

356
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:15,722
I was helping Kenzi with the
decorations and the doorbell

357
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:20,060
kept ringing, and something about...?
Oprah!!!

358
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:24,231
- You're pretty.
- Okay, look you have to listen to me.

359
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:27,233
This is going to sound outrageous
but you have to believe me.

360
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:29,668
Of course.
You're my grand-dubus.

361
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:30,636
My succu-daughter.

362
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,506
Okay, we're stuck in some sort of
a time loop. Time keeps repeating.

363
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,276
I need water.
Mmm.

364
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:39,478
It gets worse.
Okay. People are disappearing.

365
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:42,248
One we know of for sure
but there could be more.

366
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:43,316
We need your help...

367
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,317
<i>[crash] Opa!!</i>

[seasonal music playing]

369
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:52,958
Oh, I hope Kenzi's having
better luck than I am.

370
00:21:56,996 --> 00:21:58,697
My Kenzi sense is tingling.

371
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:01,699
I'm gonna mingle with your
tingle like I'm single, girl.

372
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:03,501
Say what now?

373
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:06,596
[seasonal music playing]

374
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,478
It does not smell amazing in here.

375
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:18,048
My Kenzi sense is tingling.

376
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:21,185
I feel it too, it's
like a burning sensation.

377
00:22:21,219 --> 00:22:22,086
Huh?

378
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,615
[seasonal music playing]

379
00:22:31,396 --> 00:22:33,163
These aren't mine.

380
00:22:37,702 --> 00:22:40,737
- My Kenzi sense is tingling.
- That's just my love train,

381
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:44,808
pulling into your tunnel of...
love.

382
00:22:44,842 --> 00:22:45,575

00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:52,849
Dammit!

385
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:58,488
I would have died a thousand
deaths just to meet you,

386
00:22:58,523 --> 00:23:04,027
yet now that I have,
I want to live forever.

387
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:07,063
- Awww... Hale.
- That's the one.

388
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:09,298
- That's the one?
- Mm-hmm.

389
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:13,236
Okay, um, a little, ya know, 
first-time-with-a-Fae-box  from Bo.

390
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,972
Okay... Oh wow.
That's... prepared.

391
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:19,175
We've got edible,
non-edible, fat-free,

392
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:23,812
firm, fire-proof, fig flavoured and...

393
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:27,382
Look, if you don't wanna do this.

394
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:31,787
Oh, no I-I do. 
Believe me. I do.

395
00:23:31,821 --> 00:23:33,355
[sighs]

396
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:35,758
Kenzi and Hale, take sixty-seven.

397
00:23:40,896 --> 00:23:43,731
Okay, ninth time's the charm,
c'mon Trick! Concentrate!

398
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:45,300
You can't prove I did that.

399
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:48,303
Okay, we're in a time loop the
walls are eating people, help!

400
00:23:48,337 --> 00:23:50,605
Oh this...
this izbad.

401
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,441
What?
Una Mens bad?

402
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:54,142
Smoke-nappers bad?

403
00:23:54,177 --> 00:23:56,678
Six more weeks of winter bad?
What!?

404
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:58,913
[laughs]
Yule fools!

405
00:23:58,948 --> 00:24:01,082
- He's useless to us.
- You're pretty.

406
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:02,917
- I know.
- He's been useless.

407
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:05,453
Look, I've been wanting
to say this for a while.

408
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:08,489
I know that you haven't
helped me find the Wanderer.

409
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:10,391
Why?

410
00:24:10,425 --> 00:24:13,301
Because I'm terrified.

411
00:24:13,861 --> 00:24:15,096
What aren't you telling me?

412
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,131
Okay, I don't mean to rush you but...

413
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,232
<i>Opa!</i>

414
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:22,472
[seasonal music playing]

415
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:28,041
Oh dammit, Trick.

416
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:30,376
Who else knows about... Yule.

417
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,551
Hale! Something is going on, we're
in danger, it could be Una Mens.

418
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:41,121
We've tried this already.
And nobody is taking us seriously.

419
00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:43,957
Nah, Una Mens ain't dumb
enough to cause trouble on Yule.

420
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:46,392
Hell, they're probably off playing
kissyface under the mistletoe.

421
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:48,161
Please don't tell them I said that.

422
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,197
Well whoever it is, we need all
hands on deck. Where's Kenzi?

423
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:55,235
Off freshen up. Again.
Opa!

424
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:57,103
Comet, Cupid and Blitzen.

425
00:24:57,138 --> 00:25:00,340
You know about the loop?
You're in on it?!

426
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:04,710
Haha, Krampus got both of you too?
Oh man, he's got skills.

427
00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:05,845
<i>Hold up.</i>

428
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,815
This entire thing is just
some stupid holiday prank?

429
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,751
- Seriously?
- Krampus?

430
00:25:11,785 --> 00:25:14,086
You mean that Anti-Claus Fae
you guys we're talking about?

431
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:17,356
Yeah, every year he picks a few
Yule fools to repeat the night.

432
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,391
- It's totally harmless.
- Harmless?

433
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:21,760
We just saw some guy get
sucked into the wallpaper.

434
00:25:21,794 --> 00:25:24,396
- What?
- No, no Krampus feeds on regret.

435
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,431
That's why he puts people in the loop;

436
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:29,100
<i>sooner or later they'll get
into all kinds of trouble.</i>

437
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:34,806
Hey Kiebler, what the
hell's going on here?

438
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,642
You call this a Yule party?
No fruit?

439
00:25:37,677 --> 00:25:41,412
No offerings to Vanir?
No wassailing.

440
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:43,848
And this...
this has no business here...

441
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:46,384
Oh now we gettin' all up
in each other's business?!

442
00:25:46,418 --> 00:25:49,187
This mangy cur is not
Eikpyrnir, the stag.

443
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:51,289
- It's Rudolph!!
- I knew it!!

444
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:53,291
Trick has got to hear this.

445
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:57,828
- Bo-bo, where you been?
- Where have I been?

446
00:25:57,862 --> 00:25:58,862
[scoffs]

447
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:03,467
Hey, buddy. I'm starting to think that
you were not technically invited...

448
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:06,470
Krampusnacht is a night
people should revere ...

449
00:26:06,505 --> 00:26:10,340
You'll rue the day you thought
to desecrate the Yule Lord!

450
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:13,043
Bo, watch out!

451
00:26:14,112 --> 00:26:16,246
[gasps and screams]

452
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,148
Sweet Christmas.

453
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:23,733
- Kenzie?
- Upstairs safe with Trick. 

454
00:26:23,768 --> 00:26:27,036
Was that ... shitty Santa?
Whats his name. Krampus?

455
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,038
<i>Krampus ain't supposed
to space suck people.</i>

456
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:31,841
No, he-he's just a kindly
old prankster who whisks

457
00:26:31,876 --> 00:26:34,477
naughty children off in
his sack to Candyland.

458
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:37,847
Yeah well apparently he's really
stepped up his game this year.

459
00:26:37,882 --> 00:26:40,833
- How do I find him?
- Uh, we go back to wherever

460
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,286
we showed up on his radar, I guess.

461
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,720
Which could be anywhere.

462
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:48,190
Okay, Tamsin stopped to buy gum.

463
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:50,359
She got off the number 43 bus...

464
00:26:50,394 --> 00:26:52,295
- Which goes right by...
- The gas station.

465
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:54,397
Oh god, what if
something happens to her?

466
00:26:54,431 --> 00:26:55,597
Stay calm.

467
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:58,467
If we got one thing on our
side it's time. Remember?

468
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:03,238
God, Hale why the hell would you put
yourself through this voluntarily?

469
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:06,074
Wait?
You and... Kenzi?

470
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:07,375
God, that is just skeevy.

471
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,178
Ow-ow-ow.
It's the opposite of skeevy!

472
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:14,282
Okay, look I had a
chance to perfect my game.

473
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:15,817
<i>So to speak.</i>

474
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:17,986
I swear I was going to tell her.

475
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,721
- I think you just did.
- What?

476
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,491
Who's the Yule fool now, hm?

477
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:28,329
No wait, just leave her. In a
few minutes she won't remember

478
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:32,199
- any of this anyway. Right?
- Maybe.

479
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,068
But that doesn't make it right.

480
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:35,870
[crash]

481
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:38,873
Opa!

482
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:43,511
Thanks for the part-ay.
Why am I itchy?

483
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:46,613
I didn't start back in the car.
What happened?

484
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:49,249
Are we done repeating the loop?
What does this mean?

485
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:50,334
It means Krampus has found

486
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,652
someone with enough regret
to tide him over.

487
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:56,156
And as for us, we're
back to normal time.

488
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:59,626
So life continues; without Tamsin.

489
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,628
Oh, I've gotta get to that gas station.

490
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:03,396
You stay here and
protect everybody else.

491
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,631
Whoa... Bo.

492
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:09,636
Blade of steel, hilt of bone.

493
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,638
Yuletide Eve, you must atone.

494
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:16,309
Look, Krampus may be a joke but
that doesn't make him harmless.

495
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:22,315
Thank you.

496
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:28,453
I'll pee on the post.

497
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:29,988
All right, all right. 
Whoa, whoa...

498
00:28:30,023 --> 00:28:34,192
- Here it is, here it is.
- Are you sure you know what you're doing?

499
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:36,828
Are you kidding me?
She could do a brainoplasty

500
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:38,663
with both hands tied behind her back.

501
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:41,032
That is not a thing, but thank you.

502
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:44,335
Please, can you please
confirm that this is your hand.

503
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:45,937
I'm going to need more sedatives.

504
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:51,175
Hey, honestly what are
we doing with Bo's box?

505
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:54,245
Well obviously we can't give it to her.

506
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,246
<i>Why obviously?</i>

507
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,090
Because Dyson, if I said green,
you'd say purple, to get my goat.

508
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:01,152
I don't want your goat.
I can get any goat I want.

509
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:02,219
I'm a good goat-catcher...

510
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:05,923
Oh, you both want the same
goat. We get it already.

511
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:08,859
What you two don't get.

512
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:11,795
Is that you don't hate
each other anymore.

513
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:20,203
- Okay, what's in this stuff?
- A whole lotta truth...

514
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:23,607
and a little Choga sweat.
Woohoo!

515
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,642
You know, he's right though.

516
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:29,345
I haven't hated you for a long time.

517
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,515
You're the only one that
gets my predicament, Wolfie.

518
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,750
And you make me laugh.

519
00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:40,256
To us.
To Bo.

520
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:43,726

Gah!

521
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:46,996
Ouu mmmm.

522
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,665

Come to stuff my stocking
with your Yule log again, stud?

529
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:49,557
I'm so sorry lil mama,
that was stupid.

530

- So how many times did we...?
- No, none.

531
00:30:57,298 --> 00:30:59,366
Not once; I swear.

532
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,736
I mean we came close
a couple times but we never...

533
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:05,673
Connected?

534
00:31:05,707 --> 00:31:11,729
Look I just wanted to make
this night perfect, you know?

535
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:20,353
Look dude, I dig you.

536
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:22,722
But be real. You're Fae, I'm human.

537
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,824
It's never gonna be perfect.

538
00:31:29,462 --> 00:31:34,000
And I wouldn't have it any other way.

539
00:31:34,034 --> 00:31:37,369
- I just didn't want to disappoint you.
- Are you kidding me?

00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:42,107
The Casanova of Clan Zamora?

541
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:43,509
I've never done this before.

542
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:50,649

- Where are you going?
- To freshen up.

546
00:32:14,173 --> 00:32:16,574
Everyone deserves a second chance.

547
00:32:19,077 --> 00:32:22,913

We have time.

- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- No. It's okay.

Listen up: have you been naughty?
Yes, who hasn't?

559
00:33:46,196 --> 00:33:49,898
But you are a good person.
And despite all, you are my friend.

560

And I'm not leaving you behind!

561

- This is just Bad Christmas!
- Blasphemer!

Tamsin I'm going to need your help,
I can't do this without you.

But if they make me candy,
then I can't hurt anyone anymore.

- Then everyone will like me.
- I like you...

You won't like me when
I confess the truth.

00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:20,023
I'm terrified of the Wanderer
and what he'll make me!!

681
00:40:20,057 --> 00:40:21,324
Aha!

682
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,328
[chuckles]

683
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:33,536
I'm scared.
Really, really scared.

684
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:39,842
You don't have to be.
I've got you.

685
00:40:42,746 --> 00:40:45,085
Let's go home.

686
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,352
[music]

687
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:05,026
- Are we still...?
- It's okay. 

688
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:06,761
Everything's back to normal.

689
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:09,531
Or at least what you call
normal in this crazy place.

690
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:12,734
- Bruce?
- Passed out in your bed.

691
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:14,669
Lil' nugget was all tuckered out.

692
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,275
The Wanderer.
That evil that you met.

693
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,178
Could he be my father?

694
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:30,351
That thing would've done
anything to claim his ideal mate.

695
00:41:31,486 --> 00:41:34,388
Even if it meant creating her himself.

696
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,625
Bo!
Are you okay?

697
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:39,660
Yeah, I'm fine, really.

698
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:42,597
And you, young lady,
you had me worried sick,

699
00:41:42,631 --> 00:41:46,900
- do you know that?
- I'm sorry Moms.

700
00:41:46,935 --> 00:41:48,736
We will deal with you later.

701
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,770
I see you and Hale worked things out.

702
00:41:50,804 --> 00:41:54,774
Oh sister please, I never
kiss and tell... within earshot.

703
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:56,843
Or do-everything-and-tell-
and-trust-me-we-did-everything.

704
00:41:56,877 --> 00:41:58,410
Whoa!

705
00:41:58,445 --> 00:41:59,511
[puke sound]

706
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:02,048
There's gotta be something
left to drink in this place.

707
00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:04,867
Uh, oh no, I feel
incredibly bad and I have

708
00:42:04,868 --> 00:42:07,653
no idea but, it's Yule and apparently...

709
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:09,837
The Dark can't enter
a house where the Light

710
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,591
are celebrating Yule.
Not after midnight.

711
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:15,227
- It's not the Fae way.
- Tamsin.

712
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:21,166
Lauren left already with Vex.

713
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,934
Uh, she had to 
A: sober up

714
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:25,637
and B: uh, sew his
hand back on properly...

715
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:27,873
it's a really long story, but um,

716
00:42:27,907 --> 00:42:30,942
I'm not going in with those
jerks. I'm gonna stay with you.

717
00:42:30,977 --> 00:42:34,246
No, no please go inside.
Really.

718
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,148
I need some time to myself.

719
00:42:36,182 --> 00:42:38,616
Sort through a few things.

720
00:42:38,651 --> 00:42:41,185
- No.
- Honestly, just go.

721
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:44,389
Well if you're gonna push me... 
Oh! And I found this box

722
00:42:44,423 --> 00:42:47,258
on the bed next to Dyson,
who's like totally passed out.

723
00:42:47,293 --> 00:42:49,627
It has your name on it.

724
00:42:49,895 --> 00:42:53,246
[music]

725
00:43:01,939 --> 00:43:04,741
