WEBVTT

1
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:03,174
Come on Gary, let's go.

2
00:00:03,174 --> 00:00:04,674
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, sweetie.

3
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:06,550
Hey, guys.
Where you headed?

4
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:08,089
Some weird
animal rights group

5
00:00:08,123 --> 00:00:09,671
is having a protest meeting.

6
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:11,129
They want to retire
some stupid parrot

7
00:00:11,164 --> 00:00:12,808
who performs at the dumb zoo.

8
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:15,768
Ooh, tell me more.
Your passion is contagious.

9
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:17,482
It's a requirement
for Civics class.

10
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:20,061
Oh, my little
Erin Brockovich.

11
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:21,873
I wish.

12
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:24,017
Well, you know,
I'm going to the protest

13
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:25,592
under protest.

14
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:27,468
Yeah, see, I don't want
Timmy the parrot to retire.

15
00:00:27,502 --> 00:00:28,973
He's my favorite thing
at the zoo.

16
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:30,548
Hmm. My favorite thing
is when one of the monkeys

17
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,931
goes off in the corner
and starts --

18
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:35,132
Enjoying their food plate.

19
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:37,433
- Ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

20
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:41,073
Those monkeys
are out of control.

21
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:44,448
- [ giggling ]
- [ giggling ]

22
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:46,957
Wow!

23
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:48,596
I'm standing right here!

24
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,202
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Come here, come here.

25
00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:53,107
God, it's been
driving me crazy.

26
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:55,445
That woman has been
coming here every day

27
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,917
for the past two weeks!

28
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:58,655
Oh, yeah.
There's nothing worse

29
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,058
for a restaurant
than repeat customers.

30
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,695
No, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

31
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,967
She comes in here every day
by herself.

32
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:06,405
She sits at the same table.
She doesn't bring a book.

33
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,476
She just eats
and looks around...

34
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,913
for hours!

35
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:11,316
I think she's a spy

36
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,785
for the restaurant
across the street.

37
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,657
Mm! Or she's one
of those crazy people

38
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:16,595
who gets hungry
at lunchtime.

39
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:18,832
You know, if I was her,
I would hate to think

40
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:20,836
that total strangers
are sitting around

41
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,338
trying to figure out --

42
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,509
hey, did she just talk
into her lipstick?

People Advocating
Retirement Rights Of Timmy."

63
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:16,049
I'm losing interest
already.

64
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,552
This is a horrible
misrepresentation.

65
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:21,521
He stopped wearing that
fruit hat three years ago.

66
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:23,056
Let's just grab
some of these pamphlets

67
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:24,758
and get out of here.

68
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:27,494
Don't forget this one.

69
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:32,295
My name's Kyle.

70
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:33,994
I'm kind of in charge
of this,

71
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,328
so if you have any
questions, let me know.

72
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,998
- Wait. I have questions.
- Yeah?

73
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,400
Uh, what can I do
to get more involved

74
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:41,801
with helping Timmy?

75
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:44,337
Because, not having
a boyfriend and all,

76
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,572
I have a lot of time
on my hands,

77
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:48,574
and it's something
I feel I need to do

78
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:52,777
as a single woman
with no boyfriend.

79
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,979
Well, first you can
tell me your name.

80
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:58,081
Holly.

81
00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:59,583
Shh! Go get a cookie!

82
00:02:59,617 --> 00:03:02,285
Hey, I have
a question, too.

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,853
Why don't you
leave Timmy alone

84
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:05,521
and retire
that old raggedy lion?

85
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:07,356
See, the last time
I looked,

86
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,424
he didn't have a tooth
in his head.

87
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,359
It is just sad --
plain sad --

88
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:13,194
watching
the king of the jungle

89
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:14,695
suck up some jello.

90
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,763
Well, the lion hasn't been
forced to perform

91
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:19,098
five shows a day
for the past 20 years

92
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,400
like Timmy has.

93
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,934
I am sickened!

94
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,602
Just tell me
where you want me

95
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,437
and what you want me
to do.

96
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,606
A bunch of us are going
to the zoo tomorrow to protest.

97
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,440
I'll be there.
Can I bring my boyfriend?

98
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:31,642
Just kidding.
Don't have one.

99
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:40,948
Jeff, Jeff.

100
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:43,049
I've been watching
the lone diner.

101
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,284
That's my code name
for her.

102
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,952
I'm the barracuda.

103
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:48,787
Check out my notes.

104
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:50,455
"Wears no rings."

105
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,957
Indicating not married.

106
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:53,391
"Chews her ice."

107
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:56,127
Indicating frustration --
possibly sexual.

108
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:58,296
"Strapless bra"?

109
00:03:58,331 --> 00:03:59,497
How could you tell?

110
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,931
Oh, no, that's for me.

111
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:03,434
I need to pick up one
for my new dress.

112
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,502
Oh, watch this.

113
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,073
Did you see that?

114
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:12,640
I sure did.

115
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:14,809
I think the kitchen's
being pretty damn generous

116
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:16,478
with the lobster ravioli.

117
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,813
No, she's totally
in love with your waiter.

118
00:04:19,847 --> 00:04:22,316
Oh, yeah,
I guess that makes sense.

119
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,950
She always sits
at Jamie's table

120
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:25,651
and leaves him
a really nice tip.

121
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:27,753
Mm-hmm. Then that's it.
Mystery solved.

122
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:30,589
- Yes!
- Now, how do I get them together?

123
00:04:30,623 --> 00:04:32,924
- No!
- Why?

124
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,793
Oh, 'cause you're
a terrible matchmaker.

125
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:36,327
No, I'm not.

126
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:39,264
What about Vicki and your
high school buddy A.J.?

127
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:40,898
Oh, yeah,
that worked out great.

128
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,500
I ran into him
at a Knicks game,

129
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:43,934
and he spit on me.

130
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:47,037
Don't you want them
to have what we have?

131
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:49,506
If I let you do this,
can we have what we have

132
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,107
a little more often?

133
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:52,808
How about right here,
right now?

134
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:54,810
What?

135
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:56,478
Yeah, talk's cheap.

136
00:04:57,813 --> 00:04:59,547
Okay,

137
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:01,516
she's clearly interested
in him.

138
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,518
But I think she's afraid
of rejection,

139
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,020
so I just have to find out
if he's interested in her.

140
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:08,522
So I'll take Jamie aside,
ask him a few questions,

141
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:10,958
drop a few hints,
do a little detective work.

142
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:12,192
Oh, my God. Jamie?

143
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:13,526
Yeah? What's up?

144
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:15,461
Table 14, blue sweater --
would you?

145
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:16,863
Absolutely.

146
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:17,997
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

147
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,100
Anything else, barracuda?

148
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:32,843
Sir, flier?
Retire Timmy?

149
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:34,645
Hey. I'll take a flier.

150
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,649
Great. That's a total
of...one.

151
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:40,752
This is a disaster.
I'm just gonna bail.

152
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:42,220
Hey, hey, hey.

153
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:43,888
That does not sound like
the Kyle I've known

154
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:46,691
for almost 13 hours.

155
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:48,726
Look, these things
always start small.

156
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,893
I mean, the global warming
movement started

157
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:53,095
when one guy said,
"Hey, is it hot out here,

158
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,496
or is it just me?"

159
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:56,198
- Wow.
- What?

160
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,233
It's just there's something
kind of attractive

161
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:00,301
about someone who's
so passionate and committed.

162
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:02,736
Well, I think there's
something kind of attractive

163
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,238
about people who think
passionate and committed people

164
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:08,006
are...kind of attractive.

165
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,875
So, you're a real
activist, huh?

166
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:12,343
Oh, yeah. I mean,
I believe in lots of stuff.

167
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:13,910
Like what?

168
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:15,245
Um, air. Ha ha.

169
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,712
Animals, nukes --
the big ones.

170
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:19,447
That's awesome.

171
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,381
Once, in the Mojave Desert,

172
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,350
I laid down
in front of a bulldozer

173
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,218
to save a family
of prairie dogs.

174
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,486
The desert?

175
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,288
Don't prairie dogs
live on the prairie?

176
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:32,095
Well, the prairie dogs
were lost.

177
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:34,531
That was the real tragedy.

178
00:06:34,565 --> 00:06:37,265
Listen, could you

Absolutely.

You're right.

The last time you ran
at him, he flew away.

We have to lure him in.

I got some peanuts
left over from the zoo.

Not really.
