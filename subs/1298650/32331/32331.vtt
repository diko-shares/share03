00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,354
Excuse me, sir,
is there a commode?

2
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,599
Justin!

3
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,592
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.

4
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,436
Justin, you get back here
right now!

5
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,829
No, stop!

6
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,229
- No, no! Stop him!
- Go back! Don't climb!

7
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,789
Wait, wait.

8
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,836
Hold on. Easy, little boy.

9
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,310
Okay, stop, child!
Stop right there. No!

10
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,393
No, no, no! There he goes.

11
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,595
Justin!

12
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,638
I've got him! I've got him!

13
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,475
Outrage in Egypt tonight
as it was discovered

14
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,199
that the Great Pyramid of Giza
had been stolen

15
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,999
and replaced
by a giant inflatable replica.

16
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,118
<i>There is panic throughout the globe
as countries and citizens</i>

17
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,153
<i>try to protect
their beloved landmarks.</i>

18
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,114
<i>Law enforcement
still has no leads,</i>

19
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,475
leaving everyone to wonder,
which of the world's villains

20
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,994
is responsible
for this heinous crime?

21
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,998
And where will he strike next?

22
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,229
<i>I'm having a bad, bad day</i>

23
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,232

that I get my way</i>

24

00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,589
How you doing?

32
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,591
Hello, Fred.

33
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,515
FYI, your dog has been leaving
little bombs all over my yard,

34
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,591
and I don't appreciate it.

35
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,150
Sorry. You know dogs.
They go wherever they want to go.

36
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,912
Unless they're dead.

37
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,475
I'm joking!

38
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,313
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.

39
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,674
Okay. Yeah.

Yes, you are. I heard you.

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,880
Looking good, Kevin!
How is the family? Good?

73
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,109
All right.

74
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,078
That's my Billy boy!
What up, Larry?

75
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,036
Hello, everybody!

76
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,917
Yeah, all right!

77
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,230
Simmer down. Simmer down!

78
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,117
Thank you, okay.

79
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,998
Now, I realize that you guys
probably heard

80
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,719
about this other villain
who stole the pyramids.

81
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,030
Apparently, it's a big deal.

82
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,396
People are calling it the crime
of the century and stuff like that.

83
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,473
But am I upset? No, I am not!

84
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,273
A little,

85
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,114
but we have had
a pretty good year ourselves,

86
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,998
and you guys
are all right in my book.

87
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,234
No, no raises!

88
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,357
You're not going to get
any raises.

89
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,752
What did we do?

90
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,597
Well, we stole
the Times Square JumboTron!

91
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,234
Nice!

92
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,796
That's how I roll.

93
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,709
Yeah, you all like watching football
on that, huh?

94
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,833
But that's not all.

95
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,071
We stole the Statue of Liberty,

96
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,995
the small one from Las Vegas.

97
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,914
And I won't even mention
the Eiffel Tower! Also Vegas.

98
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,673
Okay, I wasn't going to tell you
about this yet,

99
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,231
but I have been working
on something very big!

100
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,312
Something that will blow this
pyramid thing out of the water!

101
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,078
And thanks to the efforts
of my good friend Dr Nefario...

102
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,839
Thank you!

103
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,148
There he is.

104
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,639
He's styling.

105
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,437
Now, we have located a shrink ray

106
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,957
in a secret lab,
and once we take this shrink ray,

107
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,312
we will have the capability

108
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,188
to pull off the true crime
of the century.

109
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,275
We are going to steal...

110
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,918
Wait, wait!
I haven't told you what it is yet.

111
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,149
Hey.

112
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,276
Dave, listen up, please.

113
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,996
Next, we are going to steal,

114
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,310
pause for effect,

115
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,150
the moon!

116
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,995
And once the moon is mine,

117
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,592
the world will give me
whatever I want to get it back!

118
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,800
And I will be the greatest villain
of all time!

119
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,719
That's what I'm talking about.

120
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,315
Yes?

121
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,995
Hello, Gru?
I've been crunching some numbers,

122
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,117
and I really don't see
how we can afford this.

123
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,873
It can't be done.
I'm not a miracle worker.

124
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,878
Hey, chillax.

125
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,430
I'll just get another loan
from the bank. They love me!

126
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,118
Edith, stop it!

127
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,191
What? I'm just walking.

128
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,516
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.

129
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,713
Hello, girls!

130
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,519
Anybody come to adopt us
while we were out?

131
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,311
Let me think.

132
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,835
No!

133
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,878
Edith!
What did you put on my desk?

134
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,872
A mud pie.

135
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,354
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.
You know that, don't you?

136
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,635
- Yeah, I know.
- Good.

137
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,157
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?

138
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,234
Sort of.

139
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,045
We sold 43 mini-mints,

140
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,394
30 choco-swirlies,
and 18 coco-nutties.

141
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,316
Okay.

142
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,389
Well, you say that
like it's a great sale day.

143
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,550
Look at my face!

144
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,757
Do you still think
it's a great sale day?

145
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,551
Eighteen coco-nutties.

146
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,431
I think we can do a little better
than that, don't you?

147
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,229
Yeah.

148
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,518
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend
in the Box of Shame, would we? No.

149
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,035
- No, Miss Hattie.
- No, Miss Hattie.

150
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,669
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.

151
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,834
- Hi, Penny.
- Hi, Penny.

152
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,035
Hi, guys.

153
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,872
Hello, Mom.
Sorry, I meant to call, but...

154
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,351
I just wanted to congratulate you
on stealing the pyramid.

155
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,713
<i>That was you, wasn't it?</i>

156
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,436
Or was it a villain
who's actually successful?

157
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,159
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something

158
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,879
that's very, very big,
very important.

159
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,913
When you hear about it,
you're going to be very proud.

160
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,432
Good luck with that.
Okay, I'm out of here.

161
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,991
Gru to see Mr. Perkins.

162
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,391
Yes, please have a seat.

163
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,795
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

164
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,238
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

165
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,999
Ma, someday
I'm going to go to the moon.

166
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,830
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.

167
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,515
NASA isn't sending
the monkeys any more.

168
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,915
Hey.

169
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,033
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.

170
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,913
It's a mathematical term,

171
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,312
a quantity represented by an arrow,
with both direction and magnitude.

172
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,076
Vector! That's me,

173
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,188
'cause I'm committing crimes
with both direction and magnitude.

174
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,872
Oh, yeah!

175
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,478
Check out my new weapon.

176
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,710
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!

177
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,880
Fires live piranhas.
Ever seen one before?

178
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:16,396
No, you haven't.
I invented it.

179
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,550
Do you want a demonstration?

180
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,553
Shoot! So difficult, sometimes,
to get the piranha back inside of my...

181
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,995
Mr. Gru, Mr. Perkins will see you now.

182
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,109
So, all I need

183
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,112
is money from the bank
to build a rocket.

184
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,033
- And then, the moon is ours.
- Wow!

185
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,677
Well, very nice presentation.

186
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,955
I'd like to see this shrink ray.

187
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,953
Absolutely! Will do.
Soon as I have it.

188
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,877
You don't have it?

189
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,475
And yet you have the audacity
to ask the bank for money?

190
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,959
Apparently.

191
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,955
Do you have any idea

192
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,193
of the capital that this bank
has invested in you, Gru?

193
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,637
With far too few of your sinister plots
actually turning a profit.

194
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,115
How can I put it?
Let's say this apple is you.

195
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,029
If we don't start getting
our money back...

196
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,438
Get the picture?

197
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,236
Look, Gru, the point is, there are
a lot of new villains out there,

198
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,239
younger than you,
hungrier than you,

199
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,276
younger than you.

200
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,555
Like that young fellow out there
named Vector.

201
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,153
He just stole a pyramid!

202
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,511
I've got it. I've got it.

203
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,360
So, as far as getting money
for the rocket...

204
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,318
Get the shrink ray,
then we'll talk.

205
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,634
Suckers!

206
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,754
Suckers!

207
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,628
We got it!

208
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,469
What?

209
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,233
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!

210
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,869
No, no, no!

211
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,395
You!

212
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,875
<i>Now, maybe you'll think twice
before you freeze someone's head!</i>

213
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,678
<i>So long, Gru!</i>

214
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,515
Quick! We can't let him get away!

215
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,638
Up ahead! Up ahead!

216
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,357
Fire! Fire, now!

217
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,629
You missed me!

218
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,676
Come to papa!

219
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,639
Take that.

220
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,152
How adorable.

221
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,839
Got you in our sights!

222
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,755
Like taking candy from a...

223
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,875
What?

224
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,759
Hey, Gru!

225
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,832
Try this on for size!

226
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,834
That's weird. What is going...

227
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,516
This is claustrophobic!

228
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,193
No, no, no!

229
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,109
Too small!
This is too small for me!

230
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,912
I hate that guy!

231
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,319
...and please watch over us, and bless
that we'll have a good night's sleep.

232
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,279
And bless that while we're sleeping,
no bugs will crawl into our ears

233
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,510
and lay eggs in our brains.

234
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,394
Great.
Thanks for that image, Edith.

235
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,639
And please bless
that someone will adopt us soon,

236
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,518
and that the mommy and daddy
will be nice

237
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,431
and have a pet unicorn.

238
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,989
Amen.

239
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,752
- Amen.
- Amen.

240
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,597
<i>Unicorns, I love them
Unicorns, I love them</i>

241
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,229
<i>Uni, uni, unicorns
I love them</i>

242
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,792
<i>Uni, unicorns,
I could pet one</i>

243
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,156
<i>If they were really real</i>

244
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,309
<i>And they are</i>

245
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,834
<i>So, I bought one
so I could pet it</i>

246
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,993
<i>Now it loves me
Now I love it</i>

247
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,915
Don't you... What the...

248
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,312
Good luck, little girls!

249
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,396
Whoa! Cool.

250
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,319
Hi! We're orphans
from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls.

251
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,231
<i>- I don't care. Beat it!
- Come on!</i>

252
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,477
<i>We're selling cookies so,
you know, we can have a better future.</i>

253
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,279
<i>- Wait, wait!
Do you have coco-nutties? - Yeah.</i>

254
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,556
Light bulb.

255
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,794
Dr Nefario!

256
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,997
I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots
disguised as cookies!

257
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,957
<i>- What?
- Cookie robots!</i>

258
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,349
<i>- Who is this?
- Oh, forget it.</i>

259
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,393
Well, it appears you have cleared
our background check,

260
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,592
Dr Gru.

261
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,790
And I see you have made a list

262
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,475
of some of your personal achievements.

263
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,234
Thank you for that.
I love reading.

264
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,075
And I see you have been given
the Medal of Honor

265
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,196
and a knighthood.

266
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,913
- Me, me, me.
- Me, me, me.

267
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,194
Kevin?

268
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,876
You had your own cooking show

269
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,714
and you can hold your breath
for 30 seconds?

270
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,438
It's not that impressive.

271
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,749
Idiot!

272
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,393
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

273
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,118
What in the name of... What?

274
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,752
Well, here's the dealio.

275
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,550
Things have been
so lonely since my wife,

276
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,749
Debbie, passed on.

277
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,798
It's like my heart is a tooth,

278
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,116
and it's got a cavity
that can only be filled with children.

279
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,635
I'm sorry.

280
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,877
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?

281
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,669
Do I look like I speak Spanish?

282
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,870
<i>You have a face como un burro.</i>

283
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,629
Well, thank you!

284
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,629
Anyway, can we proceed
with this adoption?

285
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,233
So, so excited!

286
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,311
Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes
to come to the lobby.

287
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,878
I bet the mom is beautiful!

288
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,996
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.

289
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,753
I bet their house
is made of Gummi Bears.

290
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,915
I'm just saying it'd be nice.

291
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,111
My caterpillar
never turned into a butterfly.

292
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,758
That's a Cheeto.

293
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,116
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.

294
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,793
Who's Debbie?

295
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,233
Your wife.

296
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,113
Hi, girls!

297
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,433
Girls, I want you to meet Mr. Gru.

298
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,716
He's going to adopt you.

299
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,234
And he's a dentist!

300
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,754
Yeah!

301
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,558
Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith.

302
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,832
And that's Agnes.

303
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,797
I got your leg, I got your leg!

304
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,838
Okay, that is enough, little girl.

305
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,150
- Let go of my leg. Come on.
You can do it. - Higher!

306
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,435
- Higher!
- Just release your grip. Wow!

307
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,757
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?

308
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,717
Some nonstick spray?

309
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,759
Crowbar?

310
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,040
Okay, girls, let's go.

311
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,273
Oh, yeah!

312
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,471
Pretty impressive!

313
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,597
What are you looking at?

314
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,874
Boo-ya!

315
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,911
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!

316
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,509
Take that!

317
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,318
You done been shrunk!

318
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,269
Yello?

319
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,991
I got the shrink ray, all right.

320
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,549
No, I'm not playing with it.

321
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,073
Gru?

322
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,552
Don't make me laugh! No.

323
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,474
P.S., he is not getting the moon,

324
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,472
and P.P.S., by the time
I'm done with him,

325
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,039
he's gonna be begging for mercy.

326
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,189
Okay, bye.

327
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,033
Look at you, a little tiny toilet
for a little tiny baby...

328
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,152
Curse you, tiny toilet!

329
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,631
Okay, here we are.

330
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,199
Home sweet home.

331
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,358
So, this is, like, your house?

332
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,348
Wait a sec...

333
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,079
You're the guy who pretended
he was a recorded message!

334
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,071
No, that was someone else.

335
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,308
Can I hold your hand?

336
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,069
No.

337
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,596
<i>When we got adopted by a bald guy,
I thought this'd be more like Annie.</i>

338
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,388
No, hey!

339
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,357
Kyle, these are not treats.
These are guests.

340
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,954
Girls, this is Kyle, my

341
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,029
dog.

342
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,795
Fluffy doggy!

343
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,115
What kind of dog is that?

344
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,714
He is a... I don't know.

345
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,632
Do you really think that this is
an appropriate place for little kids?

346
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,712
'Cause it's not.

347
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,995
No! No! Stay away from there!

348
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,559
It's fragile.

349
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,350
Well, I suppose
the plan will work with two.

350
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,113
Hey! It's dark in here.

351
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,110
It poked a hole in my juice box.

352
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,074
As you can see,

353
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,516
I have provided everything
a child might need.

354
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,355
All right.

355
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,715
Okay. As I was saying... Hey!

356
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,869
Somebody broke that.

357
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,835
Okay, okay.
Clearly, we need to set some rules.

358
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,672
Rule number one.

359
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,228
You will not touch anything.

360
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,072
What about the floor?

361
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,436
Yes, you may touch the floor.

362
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,839
What about the air?

363
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,911
Yes, you may touch the air!

364
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,989
What about this?

365
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,917
- Where did you get that?
- Found it.

366
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,629
Okay. Rule number two. You will not
bother me while I'm working.

367
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,517
Rule number three.

368
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,878
You will not cry or whine
or laugh or giggle

369
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,475
or sneeze or burp or fart!

370
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,272
So, no, no, no annoying sounds.
All right?

371
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,510
Does this count as annoying?

372
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,039
Very!

373
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,708
I will see you in six hours.

374
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,474
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

375
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,278
We're gonna be really happy here.
Right? Agnes?

376
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,558
Question. What are these?

377
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,352
A dozen boogie robots! Boogie!

378
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,756
Look at this. Watch me!

379
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,040
Cookie robots.
I said cookie robots.

380
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,068
Why are you so old?

381
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,078
Okay. I'm on it.

382
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,154
Hello?

383
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,394
TV!

384
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,589
What is that?

385
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,109
- Look at that!
- That is cool!

386
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,148
Come on!

387
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,835
I don't think he's a dentist.

388
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,872
We've been working on this
for a while.

389
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,599
It's a anti-gravity serum.

390
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,356
I meant to close that.
He'll be all right, I'm sure.

391
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,352
- Do the effects wear off?
- So far,

392
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,351
no. No, they don't.

393
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,798
And here, of course,
is the new weapon you ordered.

394
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,309
No, no.

395
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,075
I said "dart gun", not... Okay.

396
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,279
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering

397
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,874
under what circumstances
would we use this?

398
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,359
But, anyway.

399
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,716
What I really wanted to show you
was this.

400
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,272
Now those are cookie robots!

401
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,477
<i>La, la, la, la
I love unicorns</i>

402
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,075
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!

403
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,720
We got bored.
What is this place?

404
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,472
Can I drink this?

405
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,915
Do you want to explode?

406
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,469
Gru!

407
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,437
Get back in the kitchen!

408
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,556
- Will you play with us?
- No.

409
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,076
- Why?
- Because I'm busy.

410
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,673
Doing what?

411
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,553
Okay, okay, you got me.

412
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,279
The dentist thing
is more of a hobby.

413
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,149
In real life, I am a spy.

414
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,677
And it is top secret,
and you may not tell anybody,

415
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,751
- because if you do...
- What does this do?

416
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,549
Hey!

417
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,759
My unicorn!

418
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,672
You have to fix it.

419
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,825
Fix it? Look,
it has been disintegrated.

420
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,835
By definition, it cannot be fixed.

421
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,990
That's freaking me out.
What is she doing?

422
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,117
She's gonna hold her breath
until she gets a new one.

423
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,671
It is just a toy. Now stop it!

424
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,916
Okay, okay! I'll fix it!

425
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,197
Tim! Mark! Phil!

426
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,954
This is very important.

427
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,396
You have to get the little girl
a new unicorn toy.

428
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,997
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!

429
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,156
Go, and hurry!

430
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,355
What are those?

431
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,477
They are my cousins.

432
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,759
Jerry! Stuart!

433
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,678
Watch them, and keep them
away from me, please.

434
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,515
- Wow!
- Wow!

435
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,035
It was your cousin's idea.

436
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,475
What?

437
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,273
Okay, bedtime.

438
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,839
Not you two!

439
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,836
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.

440
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,432
Just so you know,

441
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,397
you're never gonna be my dad.

442
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,951
I think I can live with that.

443
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,312
Are these beds
made out of bombs?

444
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,833
Yes, but they are very old
and highly unlikely to blow up.

445
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,676
But try not to toss and turn.

446
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,829
Cool.

447
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,797
- Will you read us
a bedtime story? - No.

448
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,838
But we can't go to sleep
without a bedtime story.

449
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,356
Well, then it's going to be
a long night for you, isn't it?

450
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,630
So, good night, sleep tight,
and don't let the bed bugs bite.

451
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,429
Because there are literally
thousands of them.

452
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,472
And there's probably
something in your closet.

453
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,070
He's just kidding, Agnes.

454
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,231
It's beautiful.

455
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,835
Girls, let's go.

456
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,639
Time to deliver the cookies!

457
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,120
Okay. But first,
we're going to dance class.

458
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,998
Actually, we're going to have to
skip the dance class today.

459
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,437
Actually, we can't
skip the dance class today.

460
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,431
We have a big recital coming up.

461
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,637
<i>- We're doing an excerpt
from Swan Lake. - Yeah, Swan Lake!</i>

462
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,392
That's fantastic.
Wonderful.

463
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,393
But we're going to deliver cookies!
Come on!

464
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,469
No.

465
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,309
No?

466
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,472
We're not going to deliver cookies
until we do dance class.

467
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,629
Really?

468
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,269
Well, I am not driving you
to dance class.

469
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,514
So if you want to go, you are going to
have to walk yourselves.

470
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,588
What are you doing?

471
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,352
Walking to dance class.

472
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,317
Ya? Okay, fine.

473
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,109
You just keep walking,
because I'm really not driving you!

474
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,349
Okay.

475
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,149
You're going to suffer
the wrath of Gru!

476
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,556
Seriously,
I'm going to count to three!

477
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,517
And you had better be in this car!

478
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,070
Here we go! One! Two!

479
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,596
...three, four and five.

480
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,478
And lift, and stretch.

481
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,028
And one, and two...

482
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,156
- Here you go.
- What is it?

483
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,630
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?

484
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,312
Of course, of course.

485
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,358
I have pins and needles
that I'm sitting on.

486
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,237
Pinkie promise?

487
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,472
Oh, yes. My pinkie promises.

488
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,636
All right. Our first customer
is a man named Vector.

489
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,392
But he's a V.

490
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,357
You know, we're supposed
to start with the A's.

491
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,271
Then we go to the B's. Then we...

492
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,070
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!

493
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,160
I was just thinking

494
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,835
that it might be nice
to deliver Mr. Vector's first.

495
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,478
That is all.

496
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,034
Almost over. It's almost over.

497
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,113
Girls, welcome back
to the fortress of Vector-tude!

498
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,469
Do you have my cookies for me?

499
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,757
Four boxes of mini-mints,
two toffee totes,

500
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,356
two caramel clumpies
and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.

501
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,876
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else
order that many cookies.

502
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,995
Not likely.

503
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,150
Name one person
who ordered more cookies than me.

504
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,719
That'll be $52.

505
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,508
Right.

506
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,399
Seven, eight, nine...

507
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,708
Tic Tacs! Where was I?

508
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,872
Seven, eight, nine...

509
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,678
Why are you wearing pajamas?

510
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,871
These aren't pajamas!
This is a warm-up suit.

511
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,110
- What are you warming up for?
- Stuff.

512
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,189
What sort of stuff?

513
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,589
Super-cool stuff
you wouldn't understand.

514
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,033
Like sleeping?

515
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,873
They are not pajamas!

516
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,312
Here you go, 52 big ones.

517
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,079
Bye!

518
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,119
Come on!

519
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,038
What the...

520
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,352
Quiet down, fish!

521
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,155
Down, boy!

522
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,477
We did it!
Come on, girls, let's go!

523
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,032
But what about the other people
who ordered cookies?

524
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,714
Life is full of disappointments

525
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,472
for some people.

526
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,439
Don't do that!

527
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,398
Super Silly Fun Land!
Can we go? Please?

528
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,835
No.

529
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,309
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!

530
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,389
Don't care.

531
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,549
- Please?
- Please?

532
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,198
We'll never ask for anything else,
ever again!

533
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,236
- Pretty please?
- Please?

534
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,951
- Come on!
- Come on!

535
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,715
Light bulb.

536
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,998
Come on!

537
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,913
Goodbye, have fun.

538
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,590
Sorry, dude.
They can't ride without an adult.

539
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,033
What?

540
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,555
Oh, my gosh!

541
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,949
Look at that fluffy unicorn!

542
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,795
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!

543
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,279
You've gotta let us play for it!

544
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,998
No, no, no.

545
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,308
Come on!

546
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,234
How much for the fluffy unicorn?

547
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,231
Well, it is not for sale.

548
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,195
But all you gotta do
to win it

549
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,076
is knock down
that little spaceship there.

550
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,989
It's easy!

551
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,268
Yay!

552
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,909
Again!

553
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,955
- Wait!
- Come on. One more time!

554
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,155
Just one more.

555
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,470
I accidentally closed my eyes.

556
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,111
- I hit it! I hit it!
- That was cool.

557
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,153
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?

558
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,838
She hit that.
I saw that with my own eyes.

559
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,559
Hey, buddy,
let me explain something to you.

560
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,997
You see that little tin spaceship?
You see how it's not knocked over?

561
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,799
Do you know what that means,
professor?

562
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,270
It means you don't get
the unicorn!

563
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,117
Somebody's got a frowny face.

564
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,509
Boo! Better luck next time!

565
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,234
Okay, my turn.

566
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,189
Knocked over!

567
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,158
- It's so fluffy!
- Yeah!

568
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,796
That was awesome!

569
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,438
You blew up the whole thing!

570
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,795
Let's go.
Let's try another game!

571
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,869
Gru, do you mind
if I have a quick word?

572
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,750
Okay, girls, go play.

573
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,195
I got the shrink ray!

574
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,836
Cotton candy!

575
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,588
We have 12 days
until the moon is in optimum position.

576
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,716
We can't afford any distractions!

577
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,594
Get me Perkins.

578
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,356
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Perkins,

579
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,228
but I figured
that you would want to see this!

580
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,069
What?

581
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,469
<i>Well done, Gru.
Rather impressive.</i>

582
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,438
Now, the rest of the plan
is simple.

583
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,635
I fly to the moon.
I shrink the moon.

584
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,269
I grab the moon.
I sit on the toilet.

585
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,918
What?

586
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,036
<i>Sorry. Sorry!</i>

587
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,112
<i>Could you excuse me
for just one second?</i>

588
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,553
I told you not to touch my things.

589
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,518
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.

590
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,238
Hey, can we order pizza?

591
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,151
Pizza? You just had lunch.

592
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,355
Not now, for dinner.

593
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,919
Dinner?

594
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,719
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!

595
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,518
Can we get stuffed crust?

596
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,914
- Stuffed crust!
- Stuffed crust!

597
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,513
I'll stuff you all in the crust!

598
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,759
You're funny!

599
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,479
Just don't come out of that room
again!

600
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:29,989
All right.

601
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,156
<i>Sorry about that.
Where were we?</i>

602
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,753
You were sitting on the toilet.

603
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,197
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.
It was a little attempt at humor.

604
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,953
I know how much you like to laugh

605
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,995
inside. Now, I was saying...

606
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,317
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.

607
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,675
<i>Believe me,
I am completely focused.</i>

608
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,671
<i>- Hello!
- What?</i>

609
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,875
That guy is huge!

610
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,313
<i>- Are we on TV?
- What are those? Children?</i>

611
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,073
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!

612
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,274
No, no, no!

613
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,349
Freeze ray!

614
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,998
<i>Mr. Gru?</i>

615
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,794
Okay.

616
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,439
As I was saying...

617
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,195
<i>No need to continue.
I've seen quite enough.</i>

618
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,555
<i>- But my plan...
- Is a great plan.</i>

619
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,677
<i>I love everything about your plan,
except for one thing.</i>

620
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,794
<i>You.</i>

621
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,356
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me
landing on the moon!

622
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:46,199
Look, Mom, I made a prototype
of the rocket out of macaroni!

623
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,918
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket
based on the macaroni prototype!

624
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,392
I don't understand.

625
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,915
<i>Let's face reality, Gru.</i>

626
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,551
<i>You've been at this for far too long
with far too little success.</i>

627
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,799
<i>We're gonna put our faith,
our money, into a...</i>

628
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,158
<i>Well, a younger villain.</i>

629
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,673
But I...

630
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,751
<i>It's over. Goodbye, Gru.</i>

631
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:47,432
Now, I know there have been
some rumors going around

632
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,671
that the bank
is no longer funding us.

633
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,193
Well, I am here
to put those rumors to rest.

634
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,117
They are true.

635
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,076
In terms of money,

636
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,270
we have no money.

637
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,828
So how will we get to the moon?

638
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,712
The answer is clear.

639
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,313
We won't.

640
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,435
We are doomed.

641
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:23,316
Now would probably be a good time
to look for other employment options.

642
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,949
I know.

643
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,580
I have fired up my resume

644
00:55:28,585 --> 00:55:31,035
as I suggest
that all of you do, as well.

645
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,513
What is it?

646
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,511
Can't you see that I am
in the middle of a pep talk?

647
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,279
Yes!

648
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,158
Yes, we will build our own rocket

649
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,150
using this and whatever else
we can find!

650
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,070
Grab everything! Hit the junkyards!
Take apart the cars!

651
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,357
Who needs the bank?

652
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,112
Let's go. Let's go!

653
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,231
Mom! What are you doing here?

654
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,039
And here he is in the bathtub.

655
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,312
Look at his little buns.

656
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,993
Mom.

657
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,399
Not cool.

658
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,717
And here, he's all dressed up
in his Sunday best.

659
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,476
He looks like a girl!

660
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,597
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!

661
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,993
You're funny!

662
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,793
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!

663
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,594
<i>Mr. Perkins, your son is here.</i>

664
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,432
Send him in.

665
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,152
Hey, Dad.

666
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,359
You wanted to see me?

667
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,273
- Yes, I did, Victor.
- I am not Victor any more.

668
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,670
Victor was my nerd name.
Now I am Vector!

669
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,034
Sit down!

670
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,909
Do you know where the shrink ray is?

671
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,197
Duh! Back at my place.

672
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,033
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place? That's cool.

673
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,193
I guess Gru must just have one
that looks exactly like it!

674
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,797
What the...
Those girls sold me cookies!

675
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,675
Do you have any idea
how lucrative this moon heist could be?

676
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,478
I give you the opportunity
of a lifetime,

677
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,312
and you just blow it!

678
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,311
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?

679
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,473
You just wait
until Gru sees my latest weapon.

680
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,438
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!

681
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,350
There's a squid on my face!

682
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,068
Don't worry.

683
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,277
The moon is as good as ours.

684
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,433
Come on now, it's bedtime.

685
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,557
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.

686
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,479
You did not!

687
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:48,473
Put on your PGs. Hold still.
Okay, seriously! Seriously!

688
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,872
This is beddie-bye time, right now.
I'm not kidding around. I mean it!

689
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,599
- But we're not tired!
- Well, I am tired.

690
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,796
Will you read us a bedtime story?

691
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,839
No.

692
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,114
Pretty please!

693
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,875
The physical appearance of the "please"
makes no difference.

694
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,951
It is still no, so go to sleep.

695
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,076
But we can't. We're all hyper!

696
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,870
And without a bedtime story,

697
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:16,473
we'll just keep getting up
and bugging you.

698
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,595
All night long.

699
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,874
Fine.

700
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,758
<i>All right, all right.
Sleepy Kittens.</i>

701
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,474
<i>Sleepy Kittens?</i>

702
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,233
- What are these?
- Puppets.

703
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,875
You use them when you tell the story.

704
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,114
Okay, let's get this over with.

705
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,673
"Three little kittens loved to play,
they had fun in the sun all day.

706
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,992
Then their mother came out and said,
'Time for kittens to go to bed.'"

707
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,789
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?

708
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,279
Keep reading!

709
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,315
- Come on!
- All right, all right, all right.

710
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,868
"Three little kittens started to bawl,

711
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,190
'Mommy, we're not tired at all.'

712
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,714
Their mother smiled
and said with a purr,

713
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,315
'Fine, but at least
you should brush your fur.'"

714
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,470
Now you brush the fur.

715
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,792
This is literature?

716
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,997
A 2-year-old could have written this.
All right.

717
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,398
"Three little kittens
with fur all brushed

718
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,756
said, 'We can't sleep,
we feel too rushed!'

719
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,798
Their mother replied,
with a voice like silk,

720
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,678
'Fine, but at least
you should drink your milk.'"

721
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,990
Now make them drink the milk.

722
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,869
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.

723
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,215
"Three little kittens,
with milk all gone,

724
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:46,036
rubbed their eyes
and started to yawn.

725
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,095
'We can't sleep,
we can't even try.'

726
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,713
Then their mother sang a lullaby.

727
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:03,318
'Good night kittens, close your eyes.
Sleep in peace until you rise.

728
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,952
Though while you sleep,
we are apart,

729
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:11,591
your mommy loves you
with all her heart.'"

730
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,670
The end. Okay, good night.

731
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,790
- Wait!
- What?

732
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,677
What about good night kisses?

733
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:28,155
No, no. There will be no kissing
or hugging or kissing.

734
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,428
He is not gonna kiss us
good night, Agnes.

735
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,996
I like him. He's nice.

736
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,354
But scary.

737
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,788
Like Santa!

738
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,599
Only 48 hours till the launch,
and all systems are go.

739
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,352
About that,

740
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,913
I was thinking that maybe
we could move the date of the heist.

741
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,358
Please tell me this is not as a result
of the girls' dance recital, is it?

742
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,556
No, no, no!

743
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,552
The recital? Don't... That's stupid!

744
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:25,356
I just think it's kind of weird
to do it on a Saturday.

745
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,798
I was thinking, maybe a heist
is a Tuesday thing, right?

746
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,950
Gru, you and I have been
working on this for years.

747
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,031
It's everything we've dreamed of.

748
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,951
Your chance to make history,

749
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:42,112
become the man who stole the moon!

750
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,829
But these girls
are becoming a major distraction!

751
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,194
They need to go.

752
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,754
If you don't do something about it,
then I will.

753
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,952
I understand.

754
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,793
Good.

755
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,915
Butt.

756
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,149
Butt.

757
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,315
Butt.

758
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,715
All right.
Now, when we put our cups together,

759
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,360
we will make the "clink" sound
with our mouths.

760
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,555
Ready? Edith?

761
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,629
- Clink.
- Clink.

762
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,631
There we go. And now we drink.

763
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,349
And Agnes?

764
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,475
- Clink.
- Clink.

765
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,879
Very good!

766
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,839
Excuse me, girls.

767
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,269
Come on!

768
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,750
Don't worry, I'll be back.
Keep clinking.

769
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,269
- Clink, clink.
- Clink, clink.

770
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,357
Miss Hattie,
what are you doing here?

771
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,695
I'm here for the girls.

772
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,195
I received a call that
you wanted to return them.

773
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,753
And also,
I did purchase a Spanish dictionary.

774
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,189
I didn't like what you said.

775
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,599
But...

776
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,108
I will get the girls ready.

777
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,955
Don't let her take us, Mr. Gru!

778
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,957
Tell her you wanna keep us.

779
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,951
All right, girls. Come on, let's go.

780
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,429
Goodbye, Mr. Gru.
Thanks for everything.

781
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,871
I did it for your own good.

782
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,198
Come on, let's go get that moon.

783
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,995
Right.

784
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,509
What is this for?

785
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,348
The recital?

786
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,557
I am the greatest criminal mind
of the century.

787
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,553
I don't go
to little girls' dance recitals!

788
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:47,275
<i>Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.</i>

789
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:52,150
<i>And we are good to go
in T minus 10 seconds.</i>

790
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,478
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven,</i>

791
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,549
six...

792
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:24,754
Oh, yeah!

793
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,074
Nice work, Doctor.
All systems go.

794
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,515
Boo-ya!

795
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,833
My flight suit.

796
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,557
Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty...

797
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,558
I've got it!

798
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,689
I've got the moon!

799
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,473
I've got the moon!

800
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,393
I can make it!

801
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,590
- Wait a minute!
- Kevin!

802
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,113
Come on, come on!

803
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,553
He's still not here.

804
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,949
Why would he come?
He gave us up.

805
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,519
But he pinkie promised!

806
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,239
Girls, girls, places!

807
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,993
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.

808
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,355
Can we just wait a few more minutes?

809
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,349
All right.
But just a few more minutes.

810
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,431
He's not coming, guys.

811
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,671
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?

812
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,310
Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!

813
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,791
Okay, okay. There's the library.

814
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,474
That's Third Street.
The dance studio...

815
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,913
There! There! There it is!

816
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,149
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.

817
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,038
Over?

818
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,873
Vector, open up!

819
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,949
<i>First give me the moon.
Then we'll talk.</i>

820
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,349
<i>- Mr. Gru!
- Zip it, Happy Meal.</i>

821
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,873
Now, the girls.

822
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,158
<i>Actually, I think I'll hold on to them
a little while longer.</i>

823
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,229
No!

824
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,880
<i>Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!</i>

825
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,993
Listen close, you little punk.

826
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,277
When I get in there,
you are in for a world of pain!

827
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,272
I'm really scared!

828
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,352
He is gonna kick your butt.

829
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,797
What? He punched my shark!

830
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,509
There he is!

831
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,394
Hang on, Gru.

832
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,748
Oh, no!

833
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,392
Vector has the girls. Go!

834
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,832
What happened to the ship?
It's big again!

835
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,559
- Not as big as the moon
is going to be! - What?

836
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,795
The larger the mass of an object,

837
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,510
the quicker the effects
of the shrink ray wear off!

838
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,398
I call it the Nefario Principle.

839
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,311
I just came up with it now,
actually.

840
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,553
Oh, no!

841
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,634
Did you see that?

842
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:09,354
- Vector! Help!
- Vector!

843
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,589
- Over here!
- Hey!

844
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,238
What are you girls
doing back there?

845
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,309
The moon!

846
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,789
Watch out!

847
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,198
Get as close in as you can.

848
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,228
You got it.

849
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,036
- Mr. Gru, up here!
- Mr. Gru!

850
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,076
Okay, girls! Girls!

851
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,754
- You're going to have to jump.
- Jump?

852
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,671
Are you insane?

853
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,113
Don't worry, I will catch you.

854
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,353
You gave us back!

855
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,433
I know, I know. And it is
the worst mistake I ever made.

856
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,831
But you have to jump now.

857
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,391
It'll be okay.

858
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,149
Okay, girls.

859
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,593
Jump now!

860
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,595
Margo, I will catch you.

861
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:34,152
And I will never let you go again.

862
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,316
- Not so fast!
- No!

863
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,594
Let me go!

864
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,435
Margo!

865
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,116
I'm coming, Margo.
Hang on!

866
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,313
I got you.

867
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:46,789
No!

868
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,474
Oh, poop.

869
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,272
This time, good triumphs,

870
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,352
and the moon has been returned
to its rightful place in the sky.

871
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:15,157
But once again, law enforcement
is baffled, leaving everyone to wonder,

872
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,958
who is this mysterious hero?

873
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,917
And what will he do next?

874
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,158
Okay, girls. Time for bed.

875
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,789
- Come on! We want a story.
- Three sleepy kittens!

876
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,953
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was
accidentally destroyed maliciously.

877
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:33,392
Tonight we are going to read
a new book.

878
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,596
This one is called

879
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:39,195
<i>One Big Unicorn by...
Who wrote this?</i>

880
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,509
Me! I wrote it.
Look, it's a puppet book!

881
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,918
Here, watch this.

882
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,792
That's the horn!

883
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,631
This is gonna be the best book ever!

884
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:59,316
Not to pat myself on the back,
but, yes, it probably will be.

885
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,435
Here we go.

886
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:03,398
"One big unicorn, strong and free

887
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:06,074
thought he was happy as he could be.

888
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,670
Then three little kittens came around

889
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,595
and turned his whole life
upside down."

890
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,352
Hey, that one looks like me!

891
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,476
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!

892
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,155
Any relation to persons living or dead
is completely coincidental.

893
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,835
"They made him laugh.

894
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,036
They made him cry.

895
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,555
He never should have said goodbye.

896
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:39,751
And now he knows he could never part

897
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,308
from those three little kittens

898
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,598
that changed his heart.

899
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:47,671
The end."

900
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,990
Okay, all right. Good night.

901
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,918
I love you.

902
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,078
I love you, too.

903
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,792
No, no!

904
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,989
All right.

905
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,870
Didn't I get you already?

906
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,231
They're very good!

907
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,153
I'm so proud of you, Son.

908
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:17,038
You've turned out to be
a great parent!

909
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,553
Just like me.

910
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,270
Maybe even better.

911
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,118
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.

912
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,199
No, no, no!

913
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,273
Hey, Carl! Hey.

914
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,395
No, no, no.

915
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,629
Me, me, me.

916
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,909
John?

917
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,399
No, no. Me, me, me.

918
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,149
Oh, poop.

919
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,109
Oh, no!

920
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,319
Stop! Stop!

921
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,359
Hello, I am Gru.

922
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,318
Back to work, back to work!
Back to...
