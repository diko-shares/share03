<i>Previously on
"Thunderbirds Are Go"...</i>

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,680
With the Chaos Crew on the loose,

3
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:08,033
we could use all the help we can get.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,923
- It's called a rescue-operation robot.
- Colonel Casey wants

5
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,430
the GDF to start being more
useful in the rescue department.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,750
So they're going replace us with robots?

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,670
Captain Rigby
has been given the sole task

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,150
of tracking down
The Hood and his Chaos Crew.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,489
You're a hard person to
catch, but not impossible.

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,470
<i>Space, I got Echo 247.
Mayday, mayday!</i>

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,670
<i>I read you, Echo 247.
This is International Rescue.</i>

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,630
<i>We are falling to Earth
and our engine is offline!</i>

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,150
<i>Sit tight, Echo 247.
Help is on the way.</i>

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,350
<i>International Rescue,
we have a situation. </i>

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,150
Did somebody say "space rescue"?
I'm on it.

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,630
Actually, he just said "situation".

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,150
Close enough. See you in space.

18
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,190
<i>Never mind, Alan. The GDF robot has
the situation under control.</i>

19
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,990
This is the most embarrassing
moment of my life.

20
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,070
<i>5...</i>

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,070
<i>4...</i>

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,070
<i>3...</i>

23
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,590
<i>2...</i>

24
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,795
<i>...1.</i>

25
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,619
<i>Thunderbirds are go!</i>

27
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:10,430
- I'm sick of scrubbing missions!
- Maybe this is the new normal.

28
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,870
Yeah, but it's been two days
since the robots were fully deployed.

29
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,150
And since then, we've had zero rescues.

30
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,830
- Not even a cat up a tree.
- I'm telling you. We've been replaced.

31
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,310
Before long, our robot overlords
will be controlling everything.

32
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,940
<i>Please, stay calm.
Bot guard is here to rescue you.</i>

33
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:32,070
<i>Do you require medical assistance?</i>

34
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,756
<i>Bot guard is here to rescue you.</i>

35
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,590
She hasn't said a word in two days.

36
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,070
We need her to tell us where Fuse
and The Hood are hiding.

37
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,230
You won't get anything useful out
of Havoc.

38
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,950
I'm not getting anything useful
standing here either.

39
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,510
Let's try this again.

40
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,715
Where's that brother of yours
hiding out? Huh?

41
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,066
It was a hologram!
Kayo! Sound the alarm.

42
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,270
<i>SOS! A ship is adrift.</i>

43
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,950
<i>This is the Global Defence Force.
GDF robots are on the way.</i>

44
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,630
<i>Thank you, GDF!
It's a pretty bad oil spill.</i>

45
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,590
<i>My partner is inside the tank.</i>

46
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,590
<i>Please stay calm. GDF robots are
being sent to your location.</i>

47
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,430
<i>Thank you, GDF!</i>

48
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,150
- Anything?
- Plenty, but the GDF has everything under control.

49
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,390
<i>I think we may be out of a job.</i>

50
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,030
Hold on, I'm picking
up an automated distress

51
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,350
beacon from the high-altitude
civilian-transfer station.

52
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,350
<i>That's the place with the new
tourist space elevator.</i>

53
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,950
Impressive technology, but
something is wrong with the rotor blades

54
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,750
that keep its platform flying.

55
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,310
<i>- That could be serious.
- Really serious.</i>

56
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,230
This is how it usually looks,

57
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,510
and this is what it will look like
if we don't help.

58
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,150
<i>Then I'd say we have a job to do.
Alan? You...</i>

59
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,079
Oh... never mind. Bot's on the way.

60
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,277
<i>Argh!</i>

61
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,750
Oh!

62
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,910
You feel that? We stopped moving.

63
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,350
You think it's serious?

64
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,590
<i>This is International Rescue.</i>

65
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,070
<i>We're monitoring your situation
and assistance is on the way.</i>

66
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,750
Yolu hear that? International
Rescue is coming to save us.

67
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,036
<i>Actually, uh...
the GDF is sending a robot.</i>

68
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:53,830
How did she hide the
tech to pull this off?

69
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,070
We searched Havoc six times before
she went into that holding cell.

70
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,910
No-one is blaming you, captain.

71
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,910
Even with all our intel, Havoc
has a lot of tricks up her sleeve.

72
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,510
She let herself be captured.
Havoc is up to something here.

73
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,270
Then we'd better catch
her before she finds it.

74
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,190
That's more like it.

75
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,870
Hello again.

76
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,670
Are you sure someone is coming?

77
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,310
<i>Technically, it's some thing.</i>

78
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,550
I don't see a robot, do you?

79
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,590
<i>International Rescue,
we may have a situation.</i>

80
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,590
- Another one?
- No, it's the same as before.

81
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,590
It's the GDF robots. They're at the
high-altitude station

82
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,870
- but something doesn't look right.
- Yeah!

83
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,390
<i>It's called saving the day
when we should be up there.</i>

84
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,407
That's just it... they're
not saving the day.

85
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,270
<i>They're not saving anyone.</i>

86
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,310
There's two of us and one of her.
We can take her.

87
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,990
Oh, I'm sure you can.
Might as well let you

88
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:50,470
throw me back into that cell,
but you'll have to do a better job

89
00:06:50,471 --> 00:06:54,190
searching me this time,
soldier boy.

90
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:58,110
Get back!

91
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,350
I need GDF Flyers in pursuit, now!

92
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,110
<i>We have a bit of a problem
with our plane, sir.</i>

93
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,710
I'll go after them, you catch up.

94
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,549
Go get 'em, Kayo.

95
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,510
Can somebody please find me a plane?

96
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,990
The robots seem to be caught in
what's called a feedback loop.

97
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,510
Their programming detects
two rescue situations of equal

98
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:41,990
importance and they
can't decide between the two.

99
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,094
What, so they do nothing?

100
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:47,190
A human wouldn't be having
this problem. I'm going up there.

101
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,990
We all are, Alan.
See you in the sky.

102
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,670
Yes! International
Rescue, back in action.

103
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,910
<i>5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</i>

104
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,550
<i>Thunderbirds are go.</i>

105
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,110
Thunderbird 3, you head up to the
elevators and evacuate the passengers.

106
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,230
The rest of us will try and relevel
that platform.

107
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,270
FAB.

108
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,970
Thunderbird Shadow to Rigby.

109
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:33,190
I've caught up to the Chaos Crew.
I'll maintain pursuit until you!'ll arrive.

110
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,910
Hello, Chaos Cruiser.
Nice to finally meet you.

111
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,118
- You don't look happy, sis.
- International Rescue are here for visit.

112
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:44,950
- You can go faster, right?
- Obviously.

113
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,991
They think they can go fast.
How cute.

114
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,270
Let me give it a go!

115
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,630
You think you're
a better pilot than me?

116
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,990
I'm not talking about flying.

117
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,910
Oh!

118
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,859
Thunderbird Shadow to London station.

119
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,390
<i>Right here, Kayo.</i>

120
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,470
Does any of your intel on the Chaos Cruiser
show boarding countermeasures?

121
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,990
<i>Not that I could find.
You're in pursuit, I take it?</i>

122
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,030
Affirmative.

123
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,126
Is everything all right?

124
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,600
<i>I-It seems, we have
a situation of our own here.</i>

125
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,430
Anything we can do to help?

126
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,830
I believe we have it under control.

127
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,030
Honestly, Parker.
How on earth?

128
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,430
No idea, milady!
I just found him this way.

129
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,230
<i>Please stay calm.
I am here to rescue you.</i>

130
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,110
Alright. I'm going to try to
get this thing horizontal again.

131
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,270
Thunderbird 1, there's an escape
plane on the far side of the station.

132
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,510
The pilot says there are two more
people inside the station.

133
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,230
He doesn't want to leave
until they get to the plane.

134
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,390
Okay. Tell that pilot to go.
I'll find the missing travellers.

135
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,910
- FAB.
- I'll take the sky pod over.

136
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,421
I can't wait to see
this thing in the air.

137
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:00,270
How come Scott gets all the best gear?

138
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,769
Sky pod is go.

139
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,292
All right!

140
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,230
Activating multi-launcher.

141
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,270
Firing mag clamps.

142
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,110
Positive contact.

143
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,070
Alright, let's move this thing.
Electromagnet activated.

144
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,910
Ahh!

145
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,190
- Oh. That's not going to work.
- We need those rotors back in sync.

146
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,270
Agreed. Feel like taking a walk?

147
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,550
- You mean out there?
- Rather I asked the robot to do it?

148
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,162
I'll use my gecko gloves.

149
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,510
Thunderbird 3 moving into position.

150
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,670
Uh... this just got a
little more complicated.

151
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,030
The elevators don't have an airlock.
Can I just cut them free?

152
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,510
<i>The whole system is
perfectly balanced, remember?</i>

153
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,990
<i>If the cables break, the lower
platform crashes to the ground</i>

154
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,430
<i>and the upper one goes
hurtling into space.</i>

155
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,310
- Okay, so I won't do that.
- What's it waiting for?

156
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,270
- She's still following us.
- You're not enjoying this?

157
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,070
All this flying around!
I'm bored.

158
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,310
We could always give this thing a go.

159
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,670
That's what you pinched
from the GDF, isn't it?

160
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,670
- Didn't the boss have plans for it?
- His plan was to cause chaos,

161
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,630
and that just happens
to be our speciality.

162
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:53,150
It controls those robots,
the rescue machines.

163
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,988
The GDF are about to regret ever
getting into the rescue business.

164
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,110
<i>Warning - programming override detected.</i>

165
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,690
All right, I found the rotor control.

166
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,990
Whoa!

167
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,990
Uh... Anyone want to
explain what just happened?

168
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,081
<i>Are you in need of
a-a-a-a... assistance?</i>

169
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,430
Whoa, back off!

170
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,270
I told you they had it in for me.

171
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,190
<i>Are you in need of
a-a-a-a... assistance?</i>

172
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,750
Yes, keeping away from you!
Virgil!

173
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,990
- You rang?
- Huh. Thanks, bro.

174
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,150
S-S-Show me that one!

175
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,674
Look at that!

176
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,630
<i>Brains, how do we
shut these things down?</i>

177
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,470
You can't, Virgil. Someone
has ordered their programming.

178
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,150
<i>And I bet that someone is the Chaos Crew.
Demolition missiles it is.</i>

179
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,830
Not even those can help you.
The robots are too well constructed.

180
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,590
Believe us, we know!

181
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:42,977
- Well, this is rather distressing.
- Ah! Are you kiddin'?

182
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:46,307
<i>Are you in need of
a-a-a-a... assistance?</i>

183
00:15:46,308 --> 00:15:48,341
Get off!

184
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,590
<i>I can confirm a robot-control
module has been stolen.</i>

185
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,724
- Havoc.
- Right now, the Chaos Crew

186
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:59,377
<i>is only causing robots to malfunction,</i>

187
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:01,950
<i>but if they somehow
gain total control...</i>

188
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,310
The Hood will make the
robots into weapons.

189
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,350
Colonel Casey, if I get that stolen
control module back, will the robots stop?

190
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,030
<i>It's the only way they will.</i>

191
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,350
Then leave it to me.

192
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,593
We've got us a visitor.

193
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,110
Invite her in, then.

194
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,430
The elevator cables are
starting to crush the cars.

195
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,750
- Any way to pull them apart?
- One way to find out.

196
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,710
Oh!

197
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,870
Alright. Now let me see if I can pull
a few strings to help you out.

198
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,910
<i>Very funny, Alan.</i>

199
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,910
Kayo to Rigby.
I'm on the bridge but no-one's home.

200
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,590
You know, it's not polite to come
aboard at a ship without permission.

201
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,390
I won't be staying long.

202
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,218
True, that.

203
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,590
Don't let her escape!

204
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,150
<i>Are you in need of
a-a-a-a... assistance?</i>

205
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,830
Oh!

206
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,144
<i>Are you in need of
a-a-a-a... assistance?</i>

207
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,190
<i>Are you in need of
a-a-a-a... assistance?</i>

208
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,690
Stay behind me.

209
00:18:32,691 --> 00:18:34,150
<i> Please stay calm.</i>

210
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,110
Thank you, International Rescue!

211
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,910
You have no idea how
nice it is to hear that.

212
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,790
Phew! Great work, Kayo.

213
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,630
You too, MAX.

214
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:07,390
Bah! Metal menace.

215
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:12,910
Uh, guys, I'm not sure how much
longer I can hold these things.

216
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,190
Manoeuvring rotors are back in sync.
You can let go now.

217
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,379
We're going back down!

218
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,150
<i>Are you in need of assistance?</i>

219
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,230
Uh, no, we've got this.

220
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,550
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

221
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,790
Huh. Unbelievable.

222
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:01,590
<i>Given recent events, I've decided to
suspend the robot programme.</i>

223
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,390
<i>The GDF will find other
ways to help you when we can.</i>

224
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,350
Thank you, Colonel.
Mm, it was a good idea in theory,

225
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,230
but machines can't think like people.

226
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,870
- Oh. No offence, MAX.
- None taken, I'm sure.

227
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,950
It's true thou... the human
brain is a remarkable thing.

228
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:25,190
Our capacity for abstract thinking
and problem-solving has no equal.

229
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,230
Hard to imagine something so precious

230
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,750
could be wasted on people like
The Hood and the Chaos Crew.

231
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,429
- Any new leads?
- Aside from a scan of their ship

232
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:35,007
and its capabilities, not much,

233
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:37,592
but I get the feeling The Hood has them

234
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:41,470
up to something even bigger than
taking over rescue robots.

235
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:47,350
Oh, cheer up.

236
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:52,150
That won't be the last time my
niece gets the better of you.

237
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,710
- You're not upset?
- On the contrary.

238
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,710
Considering your
breaking-in period complete.

239
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,910
I have big plans for the two of you,

240
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,910
and Havoc got what I really wanted
from the GDF, didn't you?

241
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,550
They're keeping him here.
It's called the Hex.

242
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,990
A space station.
My signals won't be reaching him there.

243
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:20,980
- Do you want us to pick him up?
- No, not yet, but soon.

244
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,230
I still need The Mechanic.

245
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,294
The GDF won't be able
to keep him safe forever.

246
