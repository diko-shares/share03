especially run up bills
on the joint's credit.

676

And why not? Nobody's
gonna pay for it anyway.

677
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.950
And as soon as the deliveries
are made in the front door,

678
00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.960
you move the stuff out the back
and sell it at a discount.

679
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.140
You take a $200 case of booze,
and you sell it for 100.

680
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.300
Doesn't matter. It's all profit.

681
00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.360

01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:07.320
I got a guy in here
from Pittsburgh

2183
01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:08.740
who's gonna help me move it.

2184
01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:10.480
Believe me, in a month,
we're gonna be fine.

2185
01:25:10.570 --> 01:25:11.770
We won't need anybody.

2186
01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:12.970
I'm afraid.

2187
01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:14.760
I'm afraid
if Paulie finds out.

2188
01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.540
What'd I just say?
Don't worry about him.

2189
01:25:16.630 --> 01:25:17.740
He is not helping us out.

2190
01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.960
Is he putting any food
on the table?

2191
01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:23.250
We've gotta help each other.
We just gotta--

2192
01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:27.020
Listen, we gotta be really,
really careful while we do it.

2193
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:33.540
I don't wanna hear a word
about her anymore, Henry.

2194
01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:34.620

You like the house?

2203
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:21.280
Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.

2204
01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.430

Don't worry with what.

2206

You just start looking
for a new house, okay?

2207
01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.340
I gotta go to Pittsburgh
in the morning.

2208
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:29.110

they owe me 15 grand.

You gotta watch out for him.

-No, I know that. I know Jimmy.

he's a good kid too.

01:27:34.170 --> 01:27:36.390
But he's crazy. He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.

You gotta watch out

of sneaking around

01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:24.320
before I could unload
the Pittsburgh stuff,

2264
01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:27.180
but when I did,
it was a real score.

2265
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:29.930
I-- I started using
Sandy's place to mix the stuff,

2266
01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:32.570
and even with Sandy
snorting more than she mixed,

2267
01:28:32.650 --> 01:28:35.330

I had a down payment
on my house,

2270
01:28:39.970 --> 01:28:41.550
and things were really rolling.

2271
01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:43.880
All I had to do
was every once in a while

2272
01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.640
was tell Sandy

and make him get us
in the front door.

Frenchy and Joe Buddha
had to round up the workers.

got in on it.

Everybody loved Stacks.

2337
01:30:59.310 --> 01:31:01.620
What he was supposed to do
was steal the panel truck

2338
01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:05.160
and afterwards compact it by
a friend of ours out in Jersey.

2339

01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:12.750
he felt he could bust
Jimmy's balls

2343
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:15.810
for an advance on the money
we were gonna steal.

What about them?

3348
02:15:31.050 --> 02:15:33.250
Am I gonna see them?
Am I gonna talk to them?

3349
02:15:33.330 --> 02:15:34.830
I mean...

3350
02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:37.710
Don't I have some kind
of contact with them?

3351
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:39.100
No.

3352
02:15:39.190 --> 02:15:40.190
No?

3353
02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:42.170
No. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

3354
02:15:42.250 --> 02:15:44.390
You mean to tell me that,
God forbid,

3355
02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:46.480
something bad happens
to my parents and they get sick,

3356
02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:47.850
I can't go and see them?

3357
02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:50.150
Maybe something
can be worked out

3358
02:15:50.230 --> 02:15:51.270
if they're sick,

3359
02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:53.570
if there's some extraordinary
set of circumstances.

3360
02:15:53.650 --> 02:15:54.780
I can't do this.

3361
02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:57.710
I can't do this, Henry. I can't.

3362
02:15:57.800 --> 02:15:59.300
I can't leave my parents.

3363
02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:03.350
Excuse me.
Karen, I told you before.

3364
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:05.460
If you-- I-I'm not gonna do this

3365
02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:07.610
unless you and the kids
come with me.

3366
02:16:09.580 --> 02:16:11.510
I-- I can't do it
without you, okay?

3367
02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:14.990
So you do whatever, but...

3368
02:16:15.070 --> 02:16:16.280
that's it.

3369
02:16:17.250 --> 02:16:19.110
You need Henry.
You don't need me, right?

3370
02:16:19.190 --> 02:16:20.190
That's right.

3371
02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:22.830
And frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

3372
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:24.390
If it's gonna make him
a happier witness,

3373
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:26.410
a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

3374
02:16:26.490 --> 02:16:28.090
They want Henry.
They don't want me.

3375
02:16:28.180 --> 02:16:30.110
But Henry's gonna be in
the witness protection program.

3376
02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:32.150
They're not gonna be able
to get to him.

3377
02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:34.610
The only way they can get to him
is by getting to you

3378
02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:35.790
or getting to your kids.

3379
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:38.240
If he goes into the program,
forget about it. You're in
a great deal of danger.

3380
02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:39.640
I don't know anything.

3381
02:16:39.730 --> 02:16:40.730
Come on.
"You don't know anything."

3382
02:16:40.810 --> 02:16:42.510
Don't give me the
babe-in-the-woods routine, Karen

3383
02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:44.170
I've listened
to those wiretaps,

3384
02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:45.800
and I've heard you
on the telephone.

3385
02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:47.220
You're talking about cocaine.

3386
02:16:47.310 --> 02:16:48.900
Conversation after conversation,

3387
02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:50.780
you're talking to Henry
on the phone.

3388
02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:57.790
It doesn't matter,
because whether he goes to jail

3389
02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:58.930
or whether he stays
on the street

3390
02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:00.540
and he beats the case,

3391
02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:01.950
he's a dead man.

3392
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:03.710
He knows it,
and you know it.

3393
02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:06.980
HENRY: What about the kids,
with school?

3394
02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:09.200
KAREN: Do they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?

3395
02:17:09.290 --> 02:17:11.140
TUDDY: Why don't you guys
go down to Wall Street

3396
02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:12.590
and get some real
fuckin' crooks?

3397
02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:14.900
Whoever sold you those suits
had a wonderful sense of humor.

3398
02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:16.220
What it comes down to, Karen,

3399
02:17:16.310 --> 02:17:18.900
is we're basically
your only salvation.

3400
02:17:18.990 --> 02:17:21.080
We're gonna save your life,
we're gonna save his life,

3401
02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:22.800
and we're gonna
keep you out of jail.

[SIGHS]

3403
02:17:26.050 --> 02:17:27.050
MAN: Mr. Hill, this morning,

3404
02:17:27.130 --> 02:17:29.060
you told the members
of this jury...

3405
02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:31.810
HENRY: It was easy
for all of us to disappear.

3406
02:17:31.890 --> 02:17:34.170
My house was in
my mother-in-law's name.

3407
02:17:34.250 --> 02:17:36.160
My cars were registered
to my wife.

3408
02:17:36.250 --> 02:17:37.490
My Social Security cards

3409
02:17:37.570 --> 02:17:40.010
and driver's licenses
were phonies.

3410
02:17:40.090 --> 02:17:42.750
I never voted.
I never paid taxes.

3411
02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:45.170
My birth certificate
and my arrest sheet--

3412
02:17:45.250 --> 02:17:47.260
that's all you'd ever have
to know I was alive.

3413
02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:49.440
ATTORNEY: Do you see him here
in the courtroom today?

3414
02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:50.520
Yes.

3415
02:17:50.610 --> 02:17:53.410
Can you please point him out
for the members of the jury?

3416
02:17:55.460 --> 02:17:56.900
Your Honor,
please let the record reflect

3417
02:17:56.980 --> 02:18:00.000
that Mr. Hill has identified
the defendant James Conway.

3418
02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:02.420
Mr. Hill, do you
also know a man

3419
02:18:02.510 --> 02:18:03.780
by the name
of Paul Cicero?

3420
02:18:03.870 --> 02:18:04.870
Yes.

3421
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:07.020
-Do you see him here
in the courtroom today?
-Yes.

3422
02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:09.550
Can you point him out
for the members of the jury?

3423
02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:12.210
Your Honor,
let the record reflect

3424
02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:15.250
that Mr. Hill has identified
the defendant Paul Cicero.

3425
02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:18.240
Your Honor, I have a document
that I'd like to have marked...

3426
02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:21.520
See, the hardest thing for me
was leaving the life.

3427
02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:23.370
I still love the life.

3428
02:18:23.450 --> 02:18:25.600
I mean, we were treated
like movie stars with muscle.

3429
02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:27.980
We had it all
just for the asking.

3430
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:29.810
Our wives, mothers, kids,

3431
02:18:29.890 --> 02:18:31.510
everybody rode along.

3432
02:18:31.590 --> 02:18:33.770
I had paper bags
filled with jewelry

3433
02:18:33.850 --> 02:18:34.890
stashed in the kitchen.

3434
02:18:34.970 --> 02:18:37.190
I had a sugar bowl
full of coke next to the bed.

3435
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:38.270
People call 'em rats

3436
02:18:38.350 --> 02:18:40.010
because a rat will do
anything to survive.

3437
02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:41.190
Isn't that right, Mr. hill?

3438
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:42.800
-ATTORNEY: Objection!
-JUDGE: Objection sustained.

3439
02:18:42.890 --> 02:18:44.740
Uh, look, I don't know nothing
about being a rat.

3440
02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:46.610
Mr. Hill, you know
everything about being a rat.

3441
02:18:46.690 --> 02:18:48.970
ATTORNEY: Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence...

3442
02:18:49.050 --> 02:18:51.350
Anything I wanted
was a phone call away--

3443
02:18:51.430 --> 02:18:53.830
free cars, the keys
to a dozen hideout flats

3444
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:55.180
all over the city.

3445
02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:57.720
I'd bet 20, 30 grand
over a weekend,

3446
02:18:57.810 --> 02:18:59.650
and then I'd either blow
the winnings in a week

3447
02:18:59.740 --> 02:19:02.130
or go to the sharks
to pay back the bookies.

3448
02:19:02.210 --> 02:19:03.970
It didn't matter.

3449
02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:05.400
It didn't mean anything.

3450
02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:06.740
When I was broke,

3451
02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:09.200
I would go out
and rob some more.

3452
02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:11.180
We ran everything.

3453
02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:13.780
We paid off cops.
We paid off lawyers.

3454
02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:15.710
We paid off judges.

3455
02:19:15.790 --> 02:19:19.130
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

3456
02:19:21.290 --> 02:19:22.930
And now it's all over.

3457
02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:26.350
And that's the hardest part.

3458
02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:29.830
Today, everything is different.
There's no action.

3459
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:32.600
I have to wait around
like everyone else.

3460
02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:35.000
Can't even get decent food.

3461
02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:36.090
Right after I got here,

3462
02:19:36.170 --> 02:19:38.200
I ordered some spaghetti
with marinara sauce,

3463
02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:41.030
and I got egg noodles
and ketchup.

3464
02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:43.820
I'm an average nobody.

3465
02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:46.250
I get to live the rest
of my life like a shnook.
