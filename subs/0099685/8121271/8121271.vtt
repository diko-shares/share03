00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.006
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:07.883
Jimmy?

3
00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:09.927
- What's up?
- Did I hit something?

4
00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:11.762
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.431
Maybe you got a flat?

6
00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:17.559
Wha...? No.

7
00:01:19.187 --> 00:01:21.146
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

8
00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.551
He's still alive. You
fucking piece of shit!

9
00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.554
Die, you motherfucker! Look at me!

10
00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:06.984
<i>As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.</i>

11
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:47.983
<i>To me...</i>

12
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:52.571
<i>being a gangster was better than
being president of the United States.</i>

13
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.244
{\an8}<i>Even before I first wandered into
the cabstand for an after-school job...</i>

14
00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:01.497
<i>I knew I wanted to be a part of them.</i>

15
00:03:01.664 --> 00:03:04.083
<i>It was there that I knew I belonged.</i>

16
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.754
<i>To me, it meant being somebody
in a neighborhood full of nobodies.</i>

17
00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:12.007
<i>They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.</i>

18
00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:15.761
<i>They double-parked in front of a hydrant,
nobody ever gave them a ticket.</i>

19
00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.263
<i>In the summer,
when they played cards all night...</i>

20
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.557
<i>nobody ever called the cops.</i>

21
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.613
Tony Stacks. How are you?

22
00:03:35.907 --> 00:03:37.366
<i>Tuddy Cicero.</i>

23
00:03:37.534 --> 00:03:39.827
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

24
00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:41.995
- How are you?
- Good.

25
00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.456
<i>Tuddy.</i>

26
00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:48.418
<i>Tuddy ran the cabstand
and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...</i>

27
00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:53.215
<i>and other places for his brother, Paul,
who was the boss of the neighborhood.</i>

28
00:03:57.846 --> 00:04:00.139
<i>Paulie might have moved slow...</i>

29
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.562
<i>but it was only because Paulie
didn't have to move for anybody.</i>

30
00:04:11.234 --> 00:04:12.860
- It's your fault.
- You started it.

31
00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:15.070
I started it? It's your fault.

32
00:04:15.238 --> 00:04:17.406
<i>At first my parents loved
that I found a job...</i>

33
00:04:17.574 --> 00:04:19.658
<i>across the street from the house.</i>

34
00:04:20.785 --> 00:04:24.538
<i>My father, who was Irish,
was sent to work at the age of 11.</i>

35
00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:26.623
<i>He liked that I got myself a job.</i>

36
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:30.335
<i>He always used to say
that American kids were spoiled lazy.</i>

37
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.755
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

38
00:04:34.257 --> 00:04:35.549
See you, Mikey.

39
00:04:35.717 --> 00:04:36.925
Bye, Henry.

40
00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:39.094
Henry! Watch how you cross!

41
00:04:39.262 --> 00:04:40.679
Bring back milk!

42
00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:43.974
<i>My mother was happy after
she found out that the Ciceros...</i>

43
00:04:44.142 --> 00:04:47.686
<i>came from the same part of Sicily
as she did. To my mother...</i>

44
00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:50.647
<i>that was the answer to all her prayers.</i>

45
00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:54.568
<i>I was the luckiest kid in the world.</i>

46
00:04:54.736 --> 00:04:57.571
<i>I could go anywhere, I could do anything.</i>

47
00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:00.407
<i>I knew everybody,
and everybody knew me.</i>

48
00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:03.619
<i>Wiseguys would pull up
and Tuddy would toss me their keys...</i>

49
00:05:03.786 --> 00:05:05.537
<i>and let me park their Cadillacs.</i>

50
00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:09.291
<i>Here I am, this little kid,
I can't even see over the steering wheel...</i>

51
00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.627
<i>and I'm parking Cadillacs.</i>

52
00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:16.965
<i>But it wasn't too long...</i>

53
00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:20.969
<i>before my parents changed
their minds about my job at the cabstand.</i>

54
00:05:21.137 --> 00:05:22.763
For your mother and sister.

55
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:26.308
<i>For them, the cabstand was supposed
to be a part-time job. But for me...</i>

56
00:05:26.476 --> 00:05:28.435
<i>it was definitely full-time.</i>

57
00:05:28.603 --> 00:05:30.520
<i>That's all I wanted to do.</i>

58
00:05:30.688 --> 00:05:34.858
<i>People like my father could never
understand, but I was a part of something.</i>

59
00:05:35.026 --> 00:05:37.819
<i>I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.</i>

60
00:05:38.655 --> 00:05:40.155
Tell him 519.

61
00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:42.324
<i>Every day I was learning to score.</i>

62
00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:44.993
<i>A dollar here, a dollar there.</i>

63
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:47.079
<i>I was living in a fantasy.</i>

64
00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:51.192
Did you have a good day at school?

65
00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:53.126
<i>My father was always pissed off.</i>

66
00:05:53.294 --> 00:05:55.420
<i>Pissed that he made such lousy money...</i>

67
00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:58.507
<i>pissed that my kid brother Michael
was in a wheelchair.</i>

68
00:05:58.675 --> 00:06:02.928
<i>He was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house.</i>

69
00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:05.055
Tell me about this.

70
00:06:05.473 --> 00:06:07.516
It's a letter from school.

71
00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:10.852
It says you haven't been there in months.

72
00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:13.438
In months!

73
00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:16.692
You're a bum!

74
00:06:16.859 --> 00:06:18.986
Want to grow up to be a bum?

75
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.700
<i>After a while, he was mostly pissed
because I hung around the cabstand.</i>

76
00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:26.743
<i>He knew what went on at that cabstand.</i>

77
00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:31.540
<i>Every once in a while, I'd have to take
a beating. But by then, I didn't care.</i>

78
00:06:31.874 --> 00:06:33.583
<i>The way I saw it...</i>

79
00:06:33.918 --> 00:06:36.545
<i>everybody takes a beating sometime.</i>

80
00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:41.508
- I can't make any more deliveries.
- What? You'll fuck everything up.

81
00:06:41.676 --> 00:06:43.719
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

82
00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:45.345
Come on with me.

83
00:06:45.596 --> 00:06:47.514
- Is that him, kid?
- No.

84
00:06:48.182 --> 00:06:49.891
- How about him?
- No.

85
00:06:51.894 --> 00:06:53.937
- That's the guy.
- Get him.

86
00:06:55.732 --> 00:06:57.065
Excuse me.

87
00:06:58.234 --> 00:07:00.902
- Scumbag.
- Come here, you piece of shit.

88
00:07:08.703 --> 00:07:10.829
- Know this kid?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:12.581
- Know where he lives?
- Yeah.

90
00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:14.958
- You deliver mail to his house?
- Yeah.

91
00:07:15.126 --> 00:07:18.920
From now on, any letter from that
school to his house comes directly here.

92
00:07:19.088 --> 00:07:20.172
- Understand?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.050
Another letter from that school
goes to that kid's house...

94
00:07:23.217 --> 00:07:25.719
in the fucking oven you'll go, head first.

95
00:07:25.887 --> 00:07:30.182
<i>That was it. No more letters from
truant officers. No letters from school.</i>

96
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.434
<i>In fact, no more letters from anybody.</i>

97
00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:36.396
<i>Finally after a few weeks, my mother
went to the post office to complain.</i>

98
00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:38.459
<i>How could I go to school after that...</i>

99
00:07:38.566 --> 00:07:42.694
<i>and pledge allegiance to the flag
and sit through good government bullshit?</i>

100
00:07:45.782 --> 00:07:48.950
<i>Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.</i>

101
00:07:49.118 --> 00:07:51.787
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

102
00:07:52.163 --> 00:07:53.789
All right, make the call.

103
00:07:53.956 --> 00:07:57.542
<i>He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back...</i>

104
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.752
<i>from an outside phone.</i>

105
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.380
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

106
00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:06.885
<i>There were guys, that's all they did
all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.</i>

107
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:20.816
<i>For a guy who moved all day long,
Paulie didn't talk to six people.</i>

108
00:08:20.983 --> 00:08:23.985
<i>If there was a union problem
or, say, a beef in the numbers...</i>

109
00:08:24.153 --> 00:08:27.656
<i>only the top guys could meet
with Paulie to discuss the problem.</i>

110
00:08:27.824 --> 00:08:31.076
<i>Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.</i>

111
00:08:31.828 --> 00:08:34.287
<i>He didn't want anybody
hearing what he said...</i>

112
00:08:34.455 --> 00:08:37.749
<i>and he didn't want anybody listening
to what he was being told.</i>

113
00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:42.170
<i>Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie,
he got a piece of everything they made.</i>

114
00:08:42.338 --> 00:08:46.675
<i>It was a tribute, like in the old country,
except they were doing it in America.</i>

115
00:08:46.843 --> 00:08:51.304
<i>All they got from Paulie was protection
from other guys looking to rip them off.</i>

116
00:08:51.472 --> 00:08:55.392
<i>That's what it's all about. That's what
the FBI could never understand.</i>

117
00:08:55.852 --> 00:08:58.019
<i>What Paulie and the Organization does...</i>

118
00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:02.107
<i>is offer protection for people
who can't go to the cops. That's it.</i>

119
00:09:02.692 --> 00:09:06.820
<i>That's all it is. They're like
the police department for wiseguys.</i>

120
00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:20.709
<i>People looked at me differently,
and they knew I was with somebody.</i>

121
00:09:20.877 --> 00:09:25.213
<i>I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery
on Sunday mornings for fresh bread.</i>

122
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:26.756
<i>The owner knew who I was with...</i>

123
00:09:26.924 --> 00:09:30.302
<i>and he'd come from around the counter.
No matter how many were waiting...</i>

124
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.471
<i>I was taken care of first.</i>

125
00:09:32.722 --> 00:09:35.056
<i>Our neighbors didn't park
in our driveway anymore...</i>

126
00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:37.851
<i>even though we didn't have a car.
At 13...</i>

127
00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:40.896
<i>I was making more money than most
of the grown-ups around.</i>

128
00:09:41.063 --> 00:09:44.191
<i>I had more money than I could spend.
I had it all.</i>

129
00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:58.997
<i>One day, some neighborhood kids carried
my mother's groceries all the way home.</i>

130
00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:00.582
<i>You know why?</i>

131
00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:03.251
<i>It was out of respect.</i>

132
00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:07.088
Hi, Mom, what do you think?

133
00:10:08.716 --> 00:10:11.426
- Look at my shoes, aren't they great?
- My God.

134
00:10:11.969 --> 00:10:13.553
You look like a gangster.

135
00:10:13.721 --> 00:10:15.430
They shot me. Help!

136
00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:19.851
Henry, shut the door.

137
00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:24.147
<i>That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.</i>

138
00:10:24.941 --> 00:10:27.108
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

139
00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:29.194
I can't have that in this joint.

140
00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.112
<i>I remember feeling bad about the guy...</i>

141
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.407
<i>but I also remember feeling
that maybe Tuddy was right.</i>

142
00:10:34.659 --> 00:10:37.285
<i>I knew Paulie didn't want
anybody dying in the building.</i>

143
00:10:37.453 --> 00:10:41.289
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

144
00:10:41.457 --> 00:10:44.709
What the hell's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

145
00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:06.314
<i>It was a glorious time.</i>

146
00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:09.818
<i>And wiseguys were all over the place.</i>

147
00:11:10.778 --> 00:11:13.738
<i>It was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe...</i>

148
00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:16.825
<i>decided to take on a boss and start a war.</i>

149
00:11:17.493 --> 00:11:19.536
<i>It was when I met the world.</i>

150
00:11:19.704 --> 00:11:22.414
<i>And it was when I first met
Jimmy Conway.</i>

151
00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:27.043
<i>He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time...</i>

152
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:29.129
<i>but he was already a legend.</i>

153
00:11:29.297 --> 00:11:33.300
<i>He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild.</i>

154
00:11:33.467 --> 00:11:36.052
<i>He'd give the doorman $100
just for opening the door.</i>

155
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.140
<i>He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.</i>

156
00:11:40.308 --> 00:11:43.268
<i>The bartender got $100
just for keeping the ice cubes cold.</i>

157
00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:46.521
The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

158
00:11:49.734 --> 00:11:52.485
- Want a drink?
- Give me a 7 and 7.

159
00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:02.996
- I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
- How you doing?

160
00:12:05.374 --> 00:12:08.084
- Thank you.
- Keep them coming.

161
00:12:08.252 --> 00:12:11.254
<i>Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.</i>

162
00:12:11.422 --> 00:12:13.048
<i>He was first locked up at 11...</i>

163
00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:16.301
<i>and he was doing hits
for mob bosses when he was 16.</i>

164
00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:19.262
<i>See, hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.</i>

165
00:12:19.722 --> 00:12:21.806
<i>But what Jimmy really loved to do...</i>

166
00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:23.975
<i>what he really loved to do was steal.</i>

167
00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:26.353
<i>He actually enjoyed it.</i>

168
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.440
<i>Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in the movies.</i>

169
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.901
Give me your wallet.

170
00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:39.032
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are. Understand?

171
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.618
<i>He was one of
the city's biggest hijackers...</i>

172
00:12:41.786 --> 00:12:45.372
<i>of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp and lobsters.</i>

173
00:12:45.539 --> 00:12:48.458
<i>Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.</i>

174
00:12:48.626 --> 00:12:52.504
<i>Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.</i>

175
00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:54.339
<i>They called him Jimmy the Gent.</i>

176
00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:55.632
Help the lady.

177
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.884
<i>Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...</i>

178
00:12:58.052 --> 00:13:01.596
<i>about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.</i>

179
00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:03.848
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

180
00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:05.433
Okay, see you later.

181
00:13:07.978 --> 00:13:09.604
Henry, come here.

182
00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:12.565
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How're you doing, Henry?

183
00:13:12.733 --> 00:13:14.734
You're gonna be working together, okay?

184
00:13:14.902 --> 00:13:16.611
Help him. Go ahead.

185
00:13:16.987 --> 00:13:19.114
Jimmy, you got anything good?

186
00:13:19.281 --> 00:13:23.493
<i>And when the cops assigned a
whole army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?</i>

187
00:13:23.661 --> 00:13:24.661
How're you doing?

188
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:26.579
<i>He made them partners.</i>

189
00:13:26.747 --> 00:13:28.456
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

190
00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.291
- One Pall Mall.
- There you go.

191
00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:32.585
- What do you need?
- Two Luckies.

192
00:13:32.753 --> 00:13:34.629
- Here you go, Henry.
- Thanks a lot.

193
00:13:34.797 --> 00:13:35.797
What do you need?

194
00:13:35.965 --> 00:13:38.633
- One Pall Mall.
- One Pall Mall, here you go.

195
00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:40.468
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

196
00:13:40.636 --> 00:13:43.638
- You have permission from your mother?
- How many cartons you need?

197
00:13:43.806 --> 00:13:46.850
- Where'd you get the cigarettes?
- Get him out of here.

198
00:13:47.017 --> 00:13:48.768
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

199
00:13:48.936 --> 00:13:52.188
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand. Store's closed.

200
00:13:57.027 --> 00:13:58.862
- Henry got pinched.
- Where?

201
00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:00.822
By the factory, selling cigarettes.

202
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.826
<i>Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.</i>

203
00:14:05.119 --> 00:14:07.912
Docket number 704162.

204
00:14:08.998 --> 00:14:11.291
Uh, yes, sir. That's me.

205
00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:16.838
Just stand there. Now stay there.

206
00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.013
Counselor, proceed.

207
00:14:28.017 --> 00:14:29.642
Congratulations.

208
00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:31.853
Here's your graduation present.

209
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:34.981
- What for? I got pinched.
- Everyone does, but you did it right.

210
00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:37.192
You told them nothing,
and they got nothing.

211
00:14:37.359 --> 00:14:40.528
- I thought you'd be mad.
- I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

212
00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:44.991
You took your first pinch like a man and
learned the two greatest things in life.

213
00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:47.494
- What?
- Look at me.

214
00:14:48.204 --> 00:14:50.330
Never rat on your friends...

215
00:14:50.498 --> 00:14:52.832
and always keep your mouth shut.

216
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.295
Here he is.

217
00:14:57.838 --> 00:14:59.714
You broke your cherry.

218
00:15:06.764 --> 00:15:08.389
Congratulations!

219
00:15:43.092 --> 00:15:46.344
<i>By the time I grew up,
there was $30 billion a year in cargo...</i>

220
00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:48.263
<i>moving through Idlewild Airport...</i>

221
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.516
<i>and believe me,
we tried to steal every bit of it.</i>

222
00:15:51.934 --> 00:15:54.435
<i>See, you gotta understand,
we grew up near the airport.</i>

223
00:15:54.603 --> 00:15:56.104
<i>It belonged to Paulie.</i>

224
00:15:56.272 --> 00:15:58.940
<i>We had friends and relatives
who worked all over the place.</i>

225
00:15:59.108 --> 00:16:02.944
<i>They would tip us off about
what was coming in and moving out.</i>

226
00:16:03.404 --> 00:16:06.197
<i>If any truckers or airlines
gave us trouble...</i>

227
00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:10.451
<i>Paulie had the union people scare them
with a strike. It was beautiful.</i>

228
00:16:10.619 --> 00:16:14.414
<i>It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and Jimmy was in charge of it all.</i>

229
00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:17.375
<i>Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.</i>

230
00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:20.003
<i>To us, it was better than Citibank.</i>

231
00:16:31.098 --> 00:16:33.474
You got a phone? Come on!

232
00:16:33.642 --> 00:16:37.395
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you believe that shit?

233
00:16:42.318 --> 00:16:44.068
<i>There was Jimmy...</i>

234
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:45.862
<i>and Tommy and me.</i>

235
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.864
<i>And there was Anthony Stabile.</i>

236
00:16:48.032 --> 00:16:49.574
How're you doing?

237
00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.326
<i>Frankie Carbone.</i>

238
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:56.497
<i>And then there was Mo Black's brother,
Fat Andy.</i>

239
00:16:57.541 --> 00:16:59.584
<i>And his guys, Frankie the Wop.</i>

240
00:17:01.545 --> 00:17:03.421
<i>Freddy No Nose.</i>

241
00:17:04.882 --> 00:17:08.885
<i>And then there was Pete the Killer,
who was Sally Balls' brother.</i>

242
00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:13.181
<i>Then you had Nickey Eyes...</i>

243
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.184
<i>and Mikey Franzese.</i>

244
00:17:16.352 --> 00:17:17.769
That guy, I wanna see him.

245
00:17:17.937 --> 00:17:21.564
<i>Jimmy Two Times, who got that nickname
because he said everything twice.</i>

246
00:17:21.732 --> 00:17:24.233
I'm gonna go get the papers,
get the papers.

247
00:17:36.372 --> 00:17:40.166
What is this? Coats?
Henry, I need suits, not coats.

248
00:17:40.668 --> 00:17:42.126
Suits are coming Thursday.

249
00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:45.213
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

250
00:17:45.381 --> 00:17:47.507
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.

251
00:17:47.675 --> 00:17:52.053
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat. How's that?

252
00:17:52.221 --> 00:17:54.889
<i>For us, to live any other way was nuts.</i>

253
00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:59.310
<i>To us, those goody-good people who
worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...</i>

254
00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:03.398
<i>and took the subway to work every day
and worried about bills, were dead.</i>

255
00:18:03.899 --> 00:18:06.484
<i>They were suckers. They had no balls.</i>

256
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.153
<i>If we wanted something, we just took it.</i>

257
00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:13.783
<i>If anyone complained twice, they got hit
so bad they never complained again.</i>

258
00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:17.453
<i>It was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.</i>

259
00:18:20.249 --> 00:18:23.084
Frankie, what the fuck does 520
have to do with 469?

260
00:18:23.252 --> 00:18:24.627
I can't believe this guy.

261
00:18:24.795 --> 00:18:28.756
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

262
00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:33.761
Piece of cake. It's all there.

263
00:18:33.929 --> 00:18:37.223
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just gotta find a way to get the key.

264
00:18:37.391 --> 00:18:39.851
- No problem, right?
- I'll take care of it.

265
00:18:47.276 --> 00:18:50.820
- Tell him what you were telling me.
- Too good to be true.

266
00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:55.491
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

267
00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:59.162
Tourists and American servicemen
change their money...

268
00:18:59.329 --> 00:19:01.289
into French money and send it back here.

269
00:19:01.457 --> 00:19:03.499
- Shh. Calm down.
- It's beautiful.

270
00:19:04.043 --> 00:19:07.170
It's totally untraceable. Okay?

271
00:19:07.337 --> 00:19:10.006
The only problem is getting a key,
but I've got a plan.

272
00:19:10.174 --> 00:19:13.551
- Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
- Yeah, he's a piece of work.

273
00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:17.597
If I'm right, there could be
$500,000 coming in, all cash.

274
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.435
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

275
00:19:22.603 --> 00:19:24.604
There's a Jewish holiday on Monday.

276
00:19:24.772 --> 00:19:27.106
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.

277
00:19:27.274 --> 00:19:29.108
What about the security?

278
00:19:29.276 --> 00:19:30.485
Security?

279
00:19:30.819 --> 00:19:33.905
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

280
00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:35.531
I'm the commandant.

281
00:19:35.699 --> 00:19:38.493
He just comes in
like he's picking up lost baggage.

282
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.204
- It's beautiful.
- It won't be a problem at all.

283
00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:42.955
- Good.
- We're on.

284
00:19:44.124 --> 00:19:47.585
What's really funny is
that fucking bank job in Secaucus.

285
00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:49.837
I'm in the middle of the weeds,
lying down.

286
00:19:50.005 --> 00:19:52.215
He says, "What are you doing?"
I said, "I'm resting."

287
00:19:52.382 --> 00:19:55.676
"Here? This ain't no beach or park."
I said, "I'm resting."

288
00:19:55.844 --> 00:19:57.303
I know I'm resting.

289
00:19:57.471 --> 00:20:00.765
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

290
00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:03.851
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing."

291
00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:08.397
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

292
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.025
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

293
00:20:13.028 --> 00:20:15.029
Bing! Pow! Boom! Bing!

294
00:20:15.197 --> 00:20:18.658
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

295
00:20:19.493 --> 00:20:22.829
Now I'm coming around,
and who do I see in front of me?

296
00:20:22.996 --> 00:20:26.666
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

297
00:20:26.834 --> 00:20:30.795
I said, "What are you doing here?
I told you to go fuck your mother."

298
00:20:31.755 --> 00:20:33.923
I thought he was gonna shit.

299
00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:36.175
Pow! Bing! Boom!

300
00:20:36.343 --> 00:20:39.053
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

301
00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:45.393
Funny. You're really funny.

302
00:20:46.603 --> 00:20:48.563
What do you mean, I'm funny?

303
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.983
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

304
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:53.860
You're a funny guy.

305
00:20:54.862 --> 00:20:57.071
You mean the way I talk? What?

306
00:20:57.906 --> 00:21:00.616
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

307
00:21:01.743 --> 00:21:04.078
You know, the way
you tell the story and everything.

308
00:21:04.246 --> 00:21:06.581
Funny how? What's funny about it?

309
00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:10.084
- Tommy, you got it all wrong.
- Whoa, whoa, Anthony.

310
00:21:10.252 --> 00:21:12.753
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
What did you say?

311
00:21:12.921 --> 00:21:14.213
Funny, how?

312
00:21:16.717 --> 00:21:18.926
Just, you know. You're funny.

313
00:21:19.344 --> 00:21:21.262
Let me understand this.

314
00:21:21.471 --> 00:21:23.472
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

315
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.976
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

316
00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:30.313
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

317
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.149
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

318
00:21:36.612 --> 00:21:38.946
You know, how you tell a story.

319
00:21:39.156 --> 00:21:42.950
No, I don't know. You said it.
How do I know? You said I'm funny.

320
00:21:43.118 --> 00:21:46.537
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

321
00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:48.456
Tell me what's funny.

322
00:21:54.129 --> 00:21:56.005
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

323
00:21:56.173 --> 00:21:58.883
Motherfucker! I almost had him!

324
00:22:00.469 --> 00:22:02.428
You stuttering prick, you!

325
00:22:02.596 --> 00:22:04.513
Frankie, was he shaking?

326
00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:09.393
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning.

327
00:22:14.024 --> 00:22:15.066
Jesus Christ.

328
00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:18.861
What the fuck is it with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

329
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:22.365
He's hanging on my fucking neck
like a vulture. What do you want?

330
00:22:22.532 --> 00:22:25.785
This guy didn't want to come
and give you the check.

331
00:22:26.328 --> 00:22:27.870
Could you take care of this?

332
00:22:28.038 --> 00:22:30.831
No problem. Tell him to put it
on my tab. Of course.

333
00:22:30.999 --> 00:22:32.917
That's what I want to talk to you about.

334
00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:36.504
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

335
00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:40.508
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order...

336
00:22:40.676 --> 00:22:42.677
Don't mean to be out of order?

337
00:22:42.844 --> 00:22:44.971
It's good you don't mean
to be out of order.

338
00:22:45.138 --> 00:22:48.849
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like I'm a deadbeat.

339
00:22:49.184 --> 00:22:50.851
You know, Sonny, you're a fucking mutt.

340
00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:53.020
You know the money
we spend in this fucking...

341
00:22:53.188 --> 00:22:55.439
- Don't be like that.
- What do you mean?

342
00:23:02.072 --> 00:23:05.366
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?

343
00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:12.039
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

344
00:23:12.374 --> 00:23:14.792
You don't want to bring the check?

345
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.462
Do you believe this prick?

346
00:23:21.341 --> 00:23:24.051
You're supposed
to be doing this stuff, too.

347
00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:25.886
You're a funny guy.

348
00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:28.931
- That's it, Henry.
- No, go back.

349
00:23:30.767 --> 00:23:34.770
You want to laugh? This prick last week
asked me to christen his kid.

350
00:23:35.397 --> 00:23:37.690
I charged him $7,000.

351
00:23:40.652 --> 00:23:42.737
You really are a funny guy.

352
00:23:46.742 --> 00:23:49.535
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds
of fucking bad things.

353
00:23:49.995 --> 00:23:51.871
He's treating me like I'm a fucking fag.

354
00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:55.583
I got to go on the lam
in order to get away from this guy.

355
00:23:55.751 --> 00:23:58.753
This ain't right. I can't go here,
I can't go there.

356
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.256
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them, they don't listen.

357
00:24:02.424 --> 00:24:06.344
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared an MIA.

358
00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:09.597
They'll find me in the back of a car
somewhere in the weeds.

359
00:24:09.765 --> 00:24:12.224
You've known this Tommy all your life.
Who knows better?

360
00:24:12.392 --> 00:24:13.893
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

361
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:17.688
When I leave my house, before I get
to the car I look over both shoulders.

362
00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:20.274
This is no way to live.
I'm no fence jumper.

363
00:24:20.442 --> 00:24:22.777
I'm around you all my life,
tell me what I gotta do.

364
00:24:22.944 --> 00:24:25.738
- Whatever I got to do, I'm gonna do.
- What could I do?

365
00:24:25.906 --> 00:24:29.992
If there was something I could do, I would.
I would like to help you out.

366
00:24:30.327 --> 00:24:32.828
Sonny, tell him what we talked about.

367
00:24:33.163 --> 00:24:35.206
- You think it's all right?
- Yeah.

368
00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:41.629
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

369
00:24:41.797 --> 00:24:44.757
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?

370
00:24:44.925 --> 00:24:47.635
It's a classy place. Look at the layout.

371
00:24:47.803 --> 00:24:50.888
You've been in there a million times.
You know how it looks.

372
00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:54.809
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

373
00:24:54.976 --> 00:24:57.978
I don't mean no disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

374
00:24:58.146 --> 00:25:01.565
I know you're his friend.
I'm begging you. What can I say?

375
00:25:02.275 --> 00:25:05.194
What am I gonna do?
What do you want from me?

376
00:25:05.529 --> 00:25:09.156
I don't know anything
about the restaurant business. Nothing.

377
00:25:09.324 --> 00:25:12.743
All I know is to sit down and order a meal,
not how to make a restaurant.

378
00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:15.162
Not for you. It's just a place to hang.

379
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.999
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

380
00:25:19.167 --> 00:25:22.169
I'd love to help you, but what do you want
from me? What'll I do?

381
00:25:22.337 --> 00:25:25.589
Tommy's a bad kid, a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

382
00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:27.716
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

383
00:25:32.722 --> 00:25:37.143
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
I just mean that he's scaring me.

384
00:25:37.352 --> 00:25:39.812
I just need help. Help me, please.

385
00:25:40.647 --> 00:25:43.023
You know anything about
this restaurant business?

386
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:46.026
He knows everything.
He's there 24 hours a day.

387
00:25:46.194 --> 00:25:48.863
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

388
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.573
That's how often he's in there.

389
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.493
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?

390
00:25:54.661 --> 00:25:58.122
What the fuck you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please. Come on.

391
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.291
It's not even fair.

392
00:26:00.542 --> 00:26:02.042
You don't understand.

393
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.671
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you, all right.

394
00:26:05.839 --> 00:26:09.925
God bless you, Paulie. I appreciate it.
You've always been fair with me.

395
00:26:10.093 --> 00:26:13.971
<i>Now the guy's got Paulie as a
partner. Any problems, he goes to Paulie.</i>

396
00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:16.223
<i>Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie.</i>

397
00:26:16.391 --> 00:26:18.559
<i>Trouble with the cops,
deliveries, Tommy...</i>

398
00:26:18.727 --> 00:26:20.019
<i>he can call Paulie.</i>

399
00:26:20.187 --> 00:26:22.980
<i>Now the guy's gotta come up
with Paulie's money every week...</i>

400
00:26:23.148 --> 00:26:24.231
<i>no matter what.</i>

401
00:26:24.399 --> 00:26:28.444
<i>"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me.</i>

402
00:26:28.612 --> 00:26:31.405
<i>"The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me."</i>

403
00:26:31.573 --> 00:26:33.741
Can I get one of those TVs?

404
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:35.576
<i>Also, Paulie could do anything.</i>

405
00:26:35.744 --> 00:26:38.787
<i>Especially run up bills on
the joint's credit. And why not?</i>

406
00:26:38.955 --> 00:26:40.915
<i>Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.</i>

407
00:26:41.082 --> 00:26:43.083
<i>When deliveries are made
at the front door...</i>

408
00:26:43.251 --> 00:26:45.920
<i>you move the stuff out the back
and sell it at a discount.</i>

409
00:26:46.087 --> 00:26:49.381
You take a $200 case of booze
<i>and sell it for $100.</i>

410
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:52.092
<i>It doesn't matter. It's all profit.</i>

411
00:26:53.929 --> 00:26:56.430
<i>Then finally, when there's nothing left...</i>

412
00:26:56.598 --> 00:26:57.598
Fucking shame.

413
00:26:57.766 --> 00:27:01.894
<i>When you can't borrow another buck
or buy another case of booze...</i>

414
00:27:02.062 --> 00:27:04.772
<i>you bust the joint out. You light a match.</i>

415
00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.440
Do you need help reaching anything?

416
00:27:06.608 --> 00:27:08.943
You look like
you're decorating a Christmas tree.

417
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.320
You don't know what you're doing.

418
00:27:14.074 --> 00:27:16.116
She's from the Five Towns.

419
00:27:16.785 --> 00:27:17.868
Who?

420
00:27:18.453 --> 00:27:21.497
The Jew broad, Diane,
I was telling you I'm going to shag.

421
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.875
I've been trying to bang her
for a fucking month now.

422
00:27:25.085 --> 00:27:27.336
She won't go out with me alone.

423
00:27:27.963 --> 00:27:29.547
- No.
- No, what?

424
00:27:30.507 --> 00:27:32.800
No, what? Who the fuck
asked you anything?

425
00:27:32.968 --> 00:27:34.927
I didn't ask you.
Hear what I'm going to say.

426
00:27:35.095 --> 00:27:36.637
All right, what?

427
00:27:37.264 --> 00:27:38.430
Okay, what.

428
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.267
She don't want to go out
with Italians alone.

429
00:27:41.434 --> 00:27:43.644
She's prejudiced against Italians.

430
00:27:43.812 --> 00:27:45.980
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?

431
00:27:46.147 --> 00:27:48.857
What the fuck is this world coming to?

432
00:27:49.985 --> 00:27:53.862
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

433
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.157
She won't go out with me alone
unless her girlfriend comes with us.

434
00:27:57.325 --> 00:27:59.326
So you come along,
go out with her girlfriend.

435
00:27:59.494 --> 00:28:01.328
See? I knew it.

436
00:28:01.496 --> 00:28:03.831
You knew what?
What the fuck is wrong with that?

437
00:28:03.999 --> 00:28:06.000
- When is this?
- Tomorrow night.

438
00:28:06.167 --> 00:28:07.668
I can't, I gotta meet Tuddy.

439
00:28:07.836 --> 00:28:10.588
You could meet Tuddy.
You can come early and then still go.

440
00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:13.090
- Why do you always do this?
- Don't give me that shit.

441
00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:15.718
What did I ask you for?
I'm asking you for a favor.

442
00:28:15.885 --> 00:28:17.678
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

443
00:28:17.846 --> 00:28:20.723
I'm trying to bang this fucking broad.
Help me out.

444
00:28:22.601 --> 00:28:24.977
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!

445
00:28:25.145 --> 00:28:28.188
Her fucking family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

446
00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:32.735
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

447
00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.946
You with your fucking mouth.

448
00:28:40.368 --> 00:28:42.369
<i>I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00...</i>

449
00:28:42.537 --> 00:28:44.788
<i>and here I am, a backup guy for Tommy.</i>

450
00:28:45.206 --> 00:28:47.541
How about it?
Did you have enough to eat?

451
00:28:47.709 --> 00:28:50.210
It was delicious. I'm
just watching my diet.

452
00:28:50.378 --> 00:28:51.712
Let me watch your figure.

453
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.422
<i>I couldn't wait to get away.</i>

454
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.175
<i>I was ordering the dessert
when they were eating dinner.</i>

455
00:28:56.343 --> 00:28:58.802
<i>When they were having coffee,
I was asking for a check.</i>

456
00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.179
<i>I had business.</i>

457
00:29:00.347 --> 00:29:02.848
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

458
00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:07.102
- Can we have the check?
- What are you doing?

459
00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.396
- I got to go.
- We just got here.

460
00:29:09.564 --> 00:29:11.565
I got that thing. I gotta go.

461
00:29:11.775 --> 00:29:13.901
Wait a couple of minutes.
We'll leave together.

462
00:29:14.069 --> 00:29:17.863
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

463
00:29:18.448 --> 00:29:20.240
<i>I couldn't stand him.</i>

464
00:29:20.575 --> 00:29:22.743
<i>I thought he was really obnoxious.</i>

465
00:29:22.911 --> 00:29:24.953
<i>He kept fidgeting around.</i>

466
00:29:25.955 --> 00:29:28.916
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

467
00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:35.673
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

468
00:29:38.593 --> 00:29:39.968
- Ready?
- Henry, lighten up.

469
00:29:40.136 --> 00:29:42.388
We just got here. What are you doing?

470
00:29:43.431 --> 00:29:46.767
<i>Before it was time to go home,
he was pushing me into the car...</i>

471
00:29:46.935 --> 00:29:50.270
<i>then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.</i>

472
00:29:50.939 --> 00:29:53.107
<i>Diane and Tommy made us promise...</i>

473
00:29:53.274 --> 00:29:55.150
<i>to meet them again on Friday night.</i>

474
00:29:55.318 --> 00:29:56.485
<i>We agreed.</i>

475
00:29:56.653 --> 00:30:00.322
<i>Of course, when Friday night came around,
Henry stood me up.</i>

476
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.283
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

477
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.829
He really liked you, too.
All he did was talk about her.

478
00:30:06.996 --> 00:30:09.456
<i>We were a trio
instead of a double date that night.</i>

479
00:30:09.624 --> 00:30:12.459
He would have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

480
00:30:12.627 --> 00:30:15.337
<i>But I made Tommy take me
looking for him.</i>

481
00:30:19.801 --> 00:30:21.468
Tommy, what the fuck?

482
00:30:21.636 --> 00:30:24.430
You got some nerve standing me up.

483
00:30:24.597 --> 00:30:25.973
Nobody does that to me.

484
00:30:26.141 --> 00:30:29.810
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?

485
00:30:30.854 --> 00:30:33.856
Slow down, I forgot.
I thought it was next week.

486
00:30:34.023 --> 00:30:37.317
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

487
00:30:38.319 --> 00:30:40.237
We can talk about this. Take it easy.

488
00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:41.822
Talk about it?

489
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.658
Talk to you after what
you just did to me? Forget it.

490
00:30:45.785 --> 00:30:49.288
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

491
00:30:49.456 --> 00:30:51.498
What do you expect? Mm?

492
00:30:52.709 --> 00:30:54.710
Let me make it up to you.

493
00:30:55.003 --> 00:30:56.170
I'll think about it.

494
00:30:56.337 --> 00:30:59.882
<i>I remember, she was screaming
on the street, and I mean loud.</i>

495
00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:01.300
<i>But she looked good.</i>

496
00:31:01.468 --> 00:31:04.678
I'll think about it.
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

497
00:31:04.846 --> 00:31:07.473
<i>She had these great eyes
just like Liz Taylor's.</i>

498
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.683
<i>At least that's what I thought.</i>

499
00:31:11.144 --> 00:31:12.227
Hello, Henry.

500
00:31:12.395 --> 00:31:13.687
- You're ready?
- Yeah.

501
00:31:13.855 --> 00:31:14.855
Come on.

502
00:31:15.023 --> 00:31:16.815
- No, wait a minute.
- What?

503
00:31:17.025 --> 00:31:19.860
Quick, you have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that...

504
00:31:20.028 --> 00:31:21.236
Karen.

505
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.863
Mom.

506
00:31:23.072 --> 00:31:25.866
- I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill.
- How do you do?

507
00:31:26.034 --> 00:31:29.536
- Nice to meet you.
- My daughter says that you're half Jewish.

508
00:31:29.704 --> 00:31:31.371
Um... It's just the good half.

509
00:31:33.249 --> 00:31:35.292
- Thank you, sir.
- Bye, see you later, thanks.

510
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.711
What're you doing?
You're leaving your car?

511
00:31:37.879 --> 00:31:39.546
He watches the car for me.

512
00:31:39.714 --> 00:31:42.382
It's easier than leaving it at a garage
and waiting.

513
00:31:42.592 --> 00:31:46.804
It's a lot quicker that way,
you know what I mean? Huh?

514
00:31:52.268 --> 00:31:55.979
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

515
00:32:00.443 --> 00:32:04.071
How are you doing? What's up?
Here you go.

516
00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:12.329
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing all right.

517
00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:13.664
Good.

518
00:32:17.085 --> 00:32:21.672
Every time I come here,
every time, you two. Don't you work?

519
00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:14.808
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

520
00:33:14.976 --> 00:33:17.019
Anthony, right in the front.

521
00:33:17.186 --> 00:33:19.479
Anything you need, just let me know.

522
00:33:37.832 --> 00:33:40.417
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

523
00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:42.794
- How are you guys doing?
- How are you?

524
00:33:48.509 --> 00:33:51.053
- You gave them $20 each.
- It's all right.

525
00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.639
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

526
00:33:53.806 --> 00:33:55.098
- Where?
- Over there.

527
00:33:55.266 --> 00:33:57.225
Thanks a lot, Tony.

528
00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:02.856
- What do you do?
- What?

529
00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.609
- What do you do?
- I'm in construction.

530
00:34:07.528 --> 00:34:09.905
They don't feel like
you're in construction.

531
00:34:10.073 --> 00:34:11.490
I'm a union delegate.

532
00:34:13.284 --> 00:34:14.785
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

533
00:34:14.953 --> 00:34:19.539
<i>the Copacabana is proud to present
the king of the one-liners...</i>

534
00:34:19.707 --> 00:34:21.667
<i>Henny Youngman.</i>

535
00:34:27.757 --> 00:34:31.551
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

536
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.139
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

537
00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:41.061
<i>I said, "Where do you
wanna go for our anniversary?"</i>

538
00:34:41.229 --> 00:34:43.105
<i>She said,
"Somewhere I've never been before."</i>

539
00:34:43.272 --> 00:34:44.606
<i>I said, "Try the kitchen."</i>

540
00:34:46.567 --> 00:34:47.859
<i>Dr. Wellsler is here.</i>

541
00:34:48.027 --> 00:34:51.071
<i>Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.</i>

542
00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:53.323
<i>Gave him another six months.</i>

543
00:34:55.284 --> 00:34:57.202
<i>I love this crowd.</i>

544
00:35:11.592 --> 00:35:13.552
<i>Air France made me.</i>

545
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.472
<i>We walked out with $420,000
without using a gun.</i>

546
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.226
<i>And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.</i>

547
00:35:25.773 --> 00:35:27.441
$60,000.

548
00:35:27.608 --> 00:35:29.776
It's going to be a good summer.

549
00:35:32.822 --> 00:35:36.491
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

550
00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:40.620
Anybody asks you where you got it, you
got it in Vegas playing craps, all right?

551
00:35:40.788 --> 00:35:42.122
All right.

552
00:35:43.791 --> 00:35:45.167
Check, sir.

553
00:35:47.295 --> 00:35:50.130
No. You have to sign for it here.

554
00:35:51.799 --> 00:35:53.467
Should I tip him?

555
00:36:01.642 --> 00:36:04.102
- How are you doing?
- Okay. How are you?

556
00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:08.273
Henry, this is Bruce. Bruce, this is Henry.

557
00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.984
Good to meet you.

558
00:36:11.861 --> 00:36:13.945
I'll see you around later.

559
00:36:18.659 --> 00:36:20.535
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

560
00:36:20.703 --> 00:36:22.496
He lives across the street.

561
00:36:47.855 --> 00:36:52.400
<i>One night, Bobby Vinton sent us
champagne. There was nothing like it.</i>

562
00:36:52.693 --> 00:36:56.530
<i>I didn't think there was
anything strange in any of this.</i>

563
00:36:56.697 --> 00:36:59.658
<i>A 21-year-old kid with such connections.</i>

564
00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:03.870
<i>He was an exciting guy.</i>

565
00:37:04.497 --> 00:37:08.500
<i>He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.</i>

566
00:37:09.085 --> 00:37:11.586
<i>Everybody wanted to be nice to him.</i>

567
00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:14.297
<i>He knew how to handle it.</i>

568
00:37:22.557 --> 00:37:24.599
{\an8}<i>Don't buy wigs that come off
at the wrong time.</i>

569
00:37:24.767 --> 00:37:27.018
{\an8}<i>Morrie's wigs don't come off!</i>

570
00:37:27.186 --> 00:37:28.478
{\an8}<i>Even underwater.</i>

571
00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:33.275
{\an8}<i>And remember, Morrie's wigs
are tested against hurricane winds.</i>

572
00:37:33.442 --> 00:37:37.154
{\an8}<i>Forget about money. You can afford
a Morrie wig. Priced to fit every budget.</i>

573
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:38.738
{\an8}<i>Call me now!</i>

574
00:37:39.907 --> 00:37:42.492
<i>Come in for a personalized fitting.</i>

575
00:37:46.455 --> 00:37:49.416
Come on, Morrie. Jimmy's waiting.
You're past due.

576
00:37:49.584 --> 00:37:52.043
You're a good kid.
We've been good to each other.

577
00:37:52.211 --> 00:37:54.629
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

578
00:37:54.797 --> 00:37:57.048
Jimmy's being a ball-breaker.

579
00:37:57.216 --> 00:37:59.134
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

580
00:37:59.302 --> 00:38:02.888
I never had to pay the vigorish
he demands. Am I something special?

581
00:38:03.055 --> 00:38:04.723
What am I, a schmuck on wheels?

582
00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:07.309
You know Jimmy.
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

583
00:38:07.476 --> 00:38:09.686
I didn't agree to three points
above the vig.

584
00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:12.355
What are you going to do?
Fight with Jimmy Conway?

585
00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:14.774
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go.

586
00:38:14.942 --> 00:38:15.942
Fuck him!

587
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:19.487
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

588
00:38:19.655 --> 00:38:21.406
Did I ever bust his balls? Did I?

589
00:38:21.574 --> 00:38:24.242
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

590
00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.579
You're talking crazy.
Stop it now, will you?

591
00:38:27.747 --> 00:38:29.623
You got money
for that fucking commercial.

592
00:38:31.125 --> 00:38:33.460
You don't got my money?

593
00:38:33.628 --> 00:38:35.503
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

594
00:38:35.671 --> 00:38:38.131
I'll fucking kill you.
Give me the money, cocksucker.

595
00:38:39.508 --> 00:38:40.926
Pay me my money.

596
00:38:41.093 --> 00:38:42.677
He'll pay.

597
00:38:43.346 --> 00:38:46.556
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.

598
00:38:47.516 --> 00:38:49.601
- Jimmy, I'm sorry.
- You should be sorry.

599
00:38:49.769 --> 00:38:52.979
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

600
00:38:53.147 --> 00:38:56.107
You hear me? Give me the fucking money.

601
00:38:56.275 --> 00:38:59.903
I'll give you. You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

602
00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:02.197
Karen, slow down.

603
00:39:03.324 --> 00:39:05.533
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

604
00:39:06.494 --> 00:39:08.787
- What happened?
- It's Karen, Jimmy.

605
00:39:08.955 --> 00:39:11.373
- Money today.
- I'll pay.

606
00:39:21.133 --> 00:39:23.510
What happened?

607
00:39:24.178 --> 00:39:25.845
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

608
00:39:26.013 --> 00:39:27.472
Who did it?

609
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:32.018
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.

610
00:39:37.191 --> 00:39:40.110
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me.

611
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:42.946
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

612
00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:46.950
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

613
00:39:49.161 --> 00:39:51.288
He pushed me out of the car.

614
00:39:59.046 --> 00:40:01.047
You sure you're all right?

615
00:40:04.093 --> 00:40:07.804
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

616
00:40:28.701 --> 00:40:31.328
What do you want, fucko?
You want something?

617
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.047
I swear on my fucking mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

618
00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:45.175
Don't shoot.

619
00:41:04.362 --> 00:41:08.323
- Hide this. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

620
00:41:12.453 --> 00:41:15.288
<i>I know there are women,
like my best friends...</i>

621
00:41:15.456 --> 00:41:18.124
<i>who would have gotten out
the minute their boyfriend...</i>

622
00:41:18.292 --> 00:41:21.169
<i>gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.</i>

623
00:41:22.088 --> 00:41:25.006
<i>I've got to admit the truth.
It turned me on.</i>

624
00:41:31.514 --> 00:41:32.764
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

625
00:42:05.297 --> 00:42:09.259
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

626
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:12.554
He's settling down now. He's married.

627
00:42:12.721 --> 00:42:15.014
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

628
00:42:15.182 --> 00:42:18.810
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.

629
00:42:26.694 --> 00:42:29.028
<i>It was like he had two families.</i>

630
00:42:29.238 --> 00:42:33.491
<i>The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once, it was crazy.</i>

631
00:42:33.701 --> 00:42:37.078
<i>Paulie and his brothers had lots
of sons and nephews.</i>

632
00:42:37.496 --> 00:42:40.373
<i>Almost all of them
were named Peter or Paul.</i>

633
00:42:41.876 --> 00:42:43.376
<i>It was unbelievable.</i>

634
00:42:43.544 --> 00:42:46.880
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

635
00:42:47.214 --> 00:42:50.216
<i>There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls at the wedding.</i>

636
00:42:50.384 --> 00:42:51.468
This is Marie.

637
00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:54.471
<i>Plus, they were all married
to girls named Marie.</i>

638
00:42:54.847 --> 00:42:57.599
- She looks Italian.
- She is Italian, you're right.

639
00:42:57.766 --> 00:43:00.518
<i>And they named all their daughters Marie.</i>

640
00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:05.106
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

641
00:43:05.441 --> 00:43:09.360
<i>By the time I finished meeting everybody,
I thought I was drunk.</i>

642
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.992
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

643
00:43:19.079 --> 00:43:20.747
Welcome to the family.

644
00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:22.248
Sunday dinner?

645
00:43:22.416 --> 00:43:25.084
So beautiful. I want to cry.

646
00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:28.505
Here's something to help you get started.

647
00:43:45.272 --> 00:43:48.858
- The bag. The bag.
- What? What bag?

648
00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:51.945
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

649
00:43:52.947 --> 00:43:56.282
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

650
00:44:26.814 --> 00:44:28.273
He didn't call?

651
00:44:28.732 --> 00:44:32.318
- He's with his friends.
- What kind of person doesn't call?

652
00:44:32.486 --> 00:44:35.655
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.

653
00:44:35.823 --> 00:44:39.284
If he was such a grown-up
why doesn't he get you two an apartment?

654
00:44:39.493 --> 00:44:42.912
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

655
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.539
You're here a month...

656
00:44:44.707 --> 00:44:46.627
and sometimes
I know he doesn't come home at all.

657
00:44:46.792 --> 00:44:48.626
What kind of people are these?

658
00:44:48.794 --> 00:44:51.629
- What do you want me to do?
- Do? What can you do?

659
00:44:51.797 --> 00:44:54.591
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?

660
00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:56.342
Did you know what they were like?

661
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:59.512
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.

662
00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.974
Stay out? Daddy never
went out at all, Ma! Keep out of it.

663
00:45:03.142 --> 00:45:05.184
You don't know how I feel!

664
00:45:05.352 --> 00:45:09.188
How do you feel now? You don't know
where he is or who he's with.

665
00:45:09.356 --> 00:45:11.858
He's with his friends! Dad!

666
00:45:12.026 --> 00:45:14.027
Leave him out of this.
He's suffered enough.

667
00:45:14.194 --> 00:45:15.994
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

668
00:45:27.833 --> 00:45:30.001
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

669
00:45:30.169 --> 00:45:34.839
We were worried to death.
A married man does not stay out like this.

670
00:45:36.842 --> 00:45:39.469
Normal people don't act like this!

671
00:45:40.929 --> 00:45:42.722
What's wrong with you?

672
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:46.976
You're not normal. She's right.
What's wrong with you?

673
00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:50.313
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

674
00:45:50.898 --> 00:45:53.107
What kind of people are they?

675
00:45:55.861 --> 00:45:58.488
<i>We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.</i>

676
00:45:58.656 --> 00:46:01.407
<i>But the first time I
realized how different...</i>

677
00:46:01.575 --> 00:46:03.951
<i>was when Mickey had a hostess party.</i>

678
00:46:04.703 --> 00:46:07.288
- Karen, where you from?
- Lawrence.

679
00:46:07.456 --> 00:46:11.751
On the Island. It's nice.
I'm from Miami. You ever been there?

680
00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:15.588
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

681
00:46:16.131 --> 00:46:18.508
Angie, stop picking at that thing.

682
00:46:18.676 --> 00:46:19.967
I'd like to smack his face.

683
00:46:20.135 --> 00:46:21.803
The red-haired guy, looks like a farmer?

684
00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:24.013
The guy's hands are all over me.

685
00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:28.559
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off."

686
00:46:30.145 --> 00:46:31.562
She means it.

687
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.899
You don't know how lucky he is.
I just mention this to Vinnie...

688
00:46:35.567 --> 00:46:38.695
How can you mention it?
Vinnie would kill him.

689
00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:42.740
If I don't, he'll kill the miserable
bastard, then Vinnie will be there for life.

690
00:46:42.908 --> 00:46:45.535
You think you got problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

691
00:46:45.703 --> 00:46:49.455
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

692
00:46:49.623 --> 00:46:53.418
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears it...

693
00:46:53.585 --> 00:46:57.505
and finds out he's jailed, she has a heart
attack and drops dead right on the spot.

694
00:46:57.673 --> 00:47:02.093
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

695
00:47:02.928 --> 00:47:05.680
- Jeannie drinks.
- Maybe she's depressed.

696
00:47:05.848 --> 00:47:08.015
Give me a break. She's drunk.

697
00:47:09.476 --> 00:47:12.812
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

698
00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:17.942
<i>They had bad skin and wore too
much makeup. They didn't look very good.</i>

699
00:47:18.277 --> 00:47:20.903
<i>They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore...</i>

700
00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:22.947
<i>was thrown together and cheap.</i>

701
00:47:23.115 --> 00:47:25.783
<i>A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.</i>

702
00:47:27.661 --> 00:47:29.412
She spends her life in a nightgown.

703
00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.873
The woman is no angel, believe me.

704
00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.542
<i>They talked about their rotten kids...</i>

705
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:37.295
<i>and about beating them
with broom handles and belts.</i>

706
00:47:37.463 --> 00:47:40.381
<i>And that the kids
still didn't pay any attention.</i>

707
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:42.467
<i>When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.</i>

708
00:47:42.634 --> 00:47:45.303
I don't know if I could live like that.

709
00:47:46.513 --> 00:47:49.849
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

710
00:47:50.017 --> 00:47:51.142
Karen.

711
00:47:52.478 --> 00:47:54.187
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...

712
00:47:54.354 --> 00:47:56.647
Do you know why Jeannie's husband
went to the can?

713
00:47:56.815 --> 00:48:00.193
Because of Jeannie.
He wanted to get away from her.

714
00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:05.072
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

715
00:48:05.407 --> 00:48:07.366
Unless they make themselves get caught.

716
00:48:07.534 --> 00:48:09.285
They don't have things organized.

717
00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:12.747
I know what I'm doing.
I've got things organized with these guys.

718
00:48:12.915 --> 00:48:17.293
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

719
00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:20.463
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car, Karen.

720
00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:24.634
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

721
00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:33.726
<i>After a while, it got to be all normal.</i>

722
00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:36.896
<i>None of it seemed like crime.</i>

723
00:48:37.064 --> 00:48:39.357
<i>It was more like Henry was enterprising...</i>

724
00:48:39.525 --> 00:48:43.236
<i>and that he and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys...</i>

725
00:48:43.403 --> 00:48:46.405
<i>were sitting on their asses
waiting for handouts.</i>

726
00:48:47.199 --> 00:48:51.160
<i>Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,
they were blue-collar guys.</i>

727
00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:55.957
<i>The only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners.</i>

728
00:48:56.416 --> 00:48:58.918
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

729
00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.677
Don't fucking move! Don't move.

730
00:49:14.977 --> 00:49:16.644
Here's your hat, you fuck.

731
00:49:17.062 --> 00:49:19.814
- See you at the diner.
- I'm riding shotgun.

732
00:49:19.982 --> 00:49:22.650
Did you see him give it right over?

733
00:49:22.818 --> 00:49:25.486
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

734
00:49:27.531 --> 00:49:29.282
Yee-ha!

735
00:49:29.449 --> 00:49:31.742
<i>We were all so very close.</i>

736
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:35.788
<i>There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.</i>

737
00:49:35.956 --> 00:49:40.626
<i>Being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal.</i>

738
00:49:40.794 --> 00:49:42.128
Hello, Mrs. Hill. Police.

739
00:49:42.296 --> 00:49:46.591
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

740
00:49:46.758 --> 00:49:48.801
Would you read and sign it?

741
00:49:49.011 --> 00:49:50.469
- Anywhere?
- Yeah, anywhere.

742
00:49:50.637 --> 00:49:53.180
This'll take a while,
we have to go through everything.

743
00:49:53.348 --> 00:49:56.434
- You boys want some coffee?
- No coffee now, thanks.

744
00:49:57.477 --> 00:50:00.605
- Be careful.
- We'll just go about our business.

745
00:50:00.772 --> 00:50:03.149
<i>There was always a little harassment.</i>

746
00:50:03.317 --> 00:50:06.110
<i>They wanted to talk to Henry
about this or that.</i>

747
00:50:06.278 --> 00:50:09.488
<i>They'd make me sign
their subpoenas or warrants.</i>

748
00:50:09.656 --> 00:50:12.033
<i>But mostly they just wanted a handout.</i>

749
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.578
<i>A few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found.</i>

750
00:50:20.834 --> 00:50:25.796
<i>I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...</i>

751
00:50:26.006 --> 00:50:28.841
<i>used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.</i>

752
00:50:29.009 --> 00:50:32.595
<i>She used to spit on her own floor.
That never made any sense to me.</i>

753
00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:35.806
<i>It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.</i>

754
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:49.403
<i>We always did everything together,
and we always were in the same crowd.</i>

755
00:50:49.571 --> 00:50:53.532
<i>Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.</i>

756
00:50:55.702 --> 00:50:57.036
{\an8}<i>The women played cards.</i>

757
00:50:57.204 --> 00:51:01.248
<i>When kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy
were the first at the hospital.</i>

758
00:51:01.416 --> 00:51:04.502
<i>When we went to the Islands
or Vegas for vacation...</i>

759
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:05.920
<i>we went together.</i>

760
00:51:06.088 --> 00:51:09.131
<i>No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.</i>

761
00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:12.343
<i>It got to where I was proud
that I had the kind of husband...</i>

762
00:51:12.511 --> 00:51:16.222
<i>who was willing to risk his neck
just to get us the little extras.</i>

763
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.351
But I got Mom to watch
the babies tomorrow night.

764
00:51:20.519 --> 00:51:22.353
- Can't do it, Karen.
- Why not?

765
00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:25.189
I just can't. I got something lined up.

766
00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:28.818
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

767
00:51:28.986 --> 00:51:32.571
- Pretty please?
- I can't. What do you want me to do?

768
00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:36.117
- I got to go.
- Wait a minute.

769
00:51:37.285 --> 00:51:39.578
I wanted to go shopping.
Can I get some money?

770
00:51:39.746 --> 00:51:41.455
How much do you need?

771
00:51:43.291 --> 00:51:45.126
- How much?
- That much.

772
00:51:49.965 --> 00:51:52.800
This much. Give me a kiss.

773
00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:58.055
See you later.

774
00:52:00.642 --> 00:52:02.935
Uh-oh...

775
00:52:03.103 --> 00:52:04.353
All right.

776
00:52:36.511 --> 00:52:38.429
Welcome home, Batts.

777
00:52:40.057 --> 00:52:41.932
Hi, how are you?

778
00:52:42.434 --> 00:52:45.728
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

779
00:52:46.354 --> 00:52:48.856
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

780
00:52:49.024 --> 00:52:50.816
There's only one Irishman here.

781
00:52:50.984 --> 00:52:52.985
It's a celebration, fellas.

782
00:52:53.195 --> 00:52:56.322
- Top of the morning to you.
- It's good to be home.

783
00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.244
This is my friend Jimmy.

784
00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:05.039
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

785
00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:08.042
Tommy. All dressed up.

786
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:11.170
All grown up and doing the town.
Look at this.

787
00:53:11.338 --> 00:53:14.131
Forgot you were having a party
for this mug.

788
00:53:14.841 --> 00:53:16.383
Come here.

789
00:53:16.551 --> 00:53:18.844
I'll say hello. Billy, how are you?

790
00:53:19.012 --> 00:53:21.847
Get over here.
I haven't seen you in six years.

791
00:53:22.015 --> 00:53:25.101
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

792
00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:27.144
Watch the suit.

793
00:53:27.687 --> 00:53:30.856
You little prick. I've
known you all my life.

794
00:53:31.358 --> 00:53:35.194
- Don't get too big on me.
- Just don't bust my balls.

795
00:53:35.362 --> 00:53:38.364
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

796
00:53:41.076 --> 00:53:43.327
This kid was great.

797
00:53:43.495 --> 00:53:45.621
They used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

798
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:49.834
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

799
00:53:50.001 --> 00:53:53.963
He was terrific. He was the best.
He made a lot of money, too.

800
00:53:55.298 --> 00:53:56.841
No more shines, Billy.

801
00:53:57.509 --> 00:53:58.968
- What?
- I said no more shines.

802
00:53:59.136 --> 00:54:01.887
You've been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

803
00:54:02.055 --> 00:54:04.181
I don't shine shoes anymore.

804
00:54:04.516 --> 00:54:08.561
Relax. What's got into you? I'm
breaking your balls a little, that's all.

805
00:54:08.728 --> 00:54:10.020
I'm only kidding with you.

806
00:54:10.188 --> 00:54:13.524
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

807
00:54:13.692 --> 00:54:15.818
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

808
00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:19.738
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

809
00:54:19.906 --> 00:54:21.824
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

810
00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:24.368
I'm sorry, too. It's okay. No problem.

811
00:54:28.957 --> 00:54:31.083
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.

812
00:54:31.251 --> 00:54:32.751
Motherfucking mutt!

813
00:54:32.919 --> 00:54:35.337
You fucking piece of shit!

814
00:54:35.964 --> 00:54:37.798
Come on, come on!

815
00:54:38.925 --> 00:54:41.677
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

816
00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:44.138
You bought your fucking button!

817
00:54:44.306 --> 00:54:46.599
- Don't get nervous.
- You motherfucker!

818
00:54:46.766 --> 00:54:49.560
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here.

819
00:54:51.104 --> 00:54:53.272
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

820
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.567
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

821
00:54:56.735 --> 00:54:59.195
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

822
00:54:59.362 --> 00:55:02.823
Teach this kid a little fucking manners.
What's right is right.

823
00:55:02.991 --> 00:55:05.451
- You understand what I'm saying?
- It's all right.

824
00:55:05.619 --> 00:55:09.997
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

825
00:55:11.958 --> 00:55:14.793
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

826
00:55:14.961 --> 00:55:17.254
- I didn't.
- You insulted him a little.

827
00:55:17.422 --> 00:55:20.674
- I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
- Okay.

828
00:55:21.134 --> 00:55:23.344
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

829
00:55:23.511 --> 00:55:25.596
No, have the drink with me.

830
00:55:26.806 --> 00:55:28.766
The drinks are on the house.

831
00:55:30.477 --> 00:55:33.562
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

832
00:55:33.855 --> 00:55:35.898
Fucking break up my party.

833
00:55:43.031 --> 00:55:45.908
You've been away for six years.
It's different now.

834
00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:48.410
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

835
00:55:49.246 --> 00:55:53.415
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

836
00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:56.252
- You're gonna get it.
- You understand?

837
00:55:59.005 --> 00:56:00.714
Get the door!

838
00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:17.982
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

839
00:56:18.149 --> 00:56:19.692
Let's shoot him.

840
00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:39.586
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

841
00:56:39.754 --> 00:56:42.381
His whole crew is going to be
looking for him.

842
00:56:44.384 --> 00:56:49.096
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

843
00:56:49.264 --> 00:56:52.891
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

844
00:56:53.059 --> 00:56:55.686
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

845
00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:01.233
Go open your trunk.

846
00:57:05.488 --> 00:57:07.323
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

847
00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:20.669
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her up.

848
00:57:22.422 --> 00:57:25.049
Look who's here.

849
00:57:26.259 --> 00:57:28.218
What did you do? What happened?

850
00:57:28.386 --> 00:57:30.929
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy will tell you.

851
00:57:31.097 --> 00:57:33.265
What happened to him?

852
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:38.187
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

853
00:57:38.355 --> 00:57:40.230
You, too. How are you?

854
00:57:40.398 --> 00:57:41.607
Why are you up so late?

855
00:57:41.775 --> 00:57:46.111
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

856
00:57:46.279 --> 00:57:50.115
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

857
00:57:50.283 --> 00:57:53.035
- Go to sleep. We're leaving.
- I can't. Not while he's home.

858
00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:55.496
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

859
00:57:55.663 --> 00:57:56.914
You go inside.

860
00:57:57.082 --> 00:57:58.402
This stuff is like lead. Ba-boom.

861
00:57:58.541 --> 00:58:01.627
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

862
00:58:01.795 --> 00:58:04.505
You haven't called. Where have you been?

863
00:58:04.672 --> 00:58:07.591
- I been working nights.
- And?

864
00:58:07.759 --> 00:58:09.551
And tonight we were out late.

865
00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:13.138
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

866
00:58:13.306 --> 00:58:16.308
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

867
00:58:16.976 --> 00:58:20.145
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay?

868
00:58:20.313 --> 00:58:22.147
- Okay.
- Just for a while.

869
00:58:22.315 --> 00:58:23.732
The poor thing.

870
00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:27.653
We hit the deer and his paw...
What do you call it?

871
00:58:27.821 --> 00:58:29.446
The paw.

872
00:58:29.614 --> 00:58:32.032
- The hoof.
- Got caught in the grill.

873
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.034
- I got to hack it off.
- Ooh.

874
00:58:34.202 --> 00:58:36.495
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

875
00:58:36.663 --> 00:58:38.497
I'll bring the knife back.

876
00:58:38.998 --> 00:58:40.833
- Delicious.
- Thank you.

877
00:58:41.042 --> 00:58:43.252
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

878
00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.254
I do, almost every night.

879
00:58:45.422 --> 00:58:47.965
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

880
00:58:48.133 --> 00:58:53.011
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you, I want to be with you.

881
00:58:53.179 --> 00:58:54.596
Settle down.

882
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:57.975
How's your friend Henry?

883
00:58:58.143 --> 00:59:00.519
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

884
00:59:00.687 --> 00:59:02.438
Talk. What are you quiet for?

885
00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:05.023
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

886
00:59:05.191 --> 00:59:07.693
- I'm just listening.
- Something wrong?

887
00:59:07.861 --> 00:59:11.405
When we were kids,
the compares used to visit one another.

888
00:59:11.614 --> 00:59:16.368
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night, not a word.

889
00:59:16.786 --> 00:59:21.081
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

890
00:59:21.708 --> 00:59:25.377
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

891
00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:29.298
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking."

892
00:59:31.176 --> 00:59:33.677
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

893
00:59:33.845 --> 00:59:35.387
<i>- Cornuto contento.</i>
- That's it.

894
00:59:35.555 --> 00:59:39.183
- What does that mean?
- It means he's content to be a jerk.

895
00:59:39.726 --> 00:59:42.269
He doesn't care who knows it.

896
00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:45.230
- Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
- No.

897
00:59:46.232 --> 00:59:47.774
Look at this.

898
00:59:47.942 --> 00:59:49.234
It's beautiful.

899
00:59:49.402 --> 00:59:52.488
I like it. One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

900
00:59:52.655 --> 00:59:55.073
One's facing east, the other west.
So what?

901
00:59:55.241 --> 00:59:58.660
He's saying, "What do you want
from me?" The guy's got nice white hair.

902
00:59:58.828 --> 01:00:00.996
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

903
01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:03.165
Looks like somebody we know.

904
01:00:04.918 --> 01:00:07.044
Without the beard. It's him.

905
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:10.881
It's him.

906
01:00:20.391 --> 01:00:21.725
What the fuck is that?

907
01:00:21.893 --> 01:00:24.478
<i>For most of the guys,
killings were accepted.</i>

908
01:00:24.646 --> 01:00:27.356
<i>Murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line.</i>

909
01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:30.776
<i>You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.</i>

910
01:00:30.944 --> 01:00:34.404
<i>Sometimes, even if people didn't
get out of line, they got whacked.</i>

911
01:00:34.572 --> 01:00:38.992
<i>Hits became a habit. Guys would get
into arguments over nothing.</i>

912
01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.370
<i>Before you knew it, one was dead.</i>

913
01:00:41.538 --> 01:00:43.747
<i>They were shooting each other
all the time.</i>

914
01:00:43.915 --> 01:00:47.459
<i>Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.</i>

915
01:00:49.128 --> 01:00:51.964
<i>We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.</i>

916
01:00:52.131 --> 01:00:56.260
<i>This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.</i>

917
01:00:56.427 --> 01:00:59.972
<i>Batts was part of the Gambino crew
and was considered untouchable.</i>

918
01:01:00.723 --> 01:01:04.226
<i>Before you touched a made guy,
you had to have a good reason.</i>

919
01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:07.145
<i>You had to have a sit-down
and you'd better get an okay...</i>

920
01:01:07.313 --> 01:01:09.648
<i>or you'd be the one who got whacked.</i>

921
01:01:21.828 --> 01:01:23.662
<i>Saturday night was for wives...</i>

922
01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:26.999
<i>but Friday night at the Copa
was for the girlfriends.</i>

923
01:01:28.835 --> 01:01:31.086
Last week, we saw Sammy Davis, Jr.

924
01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:34.172
You got to see this show.
What a performer.

925
01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:37.843
He does these impersonations.
You'd think it was the real people.

926
01:01:38.011 --> 01:01:42.097
It's unbelievable. You could see
how a white girl could fall for him.

927
01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:43.515
What?

928
01:01:44.183 --> 01:01:48.645
Not me. But you could see how
some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

929
01:01:49.063 --> 01:01:50.981
So you condone that stuff.

930
01:01:51.149 --> 01:01:52.482
Take it easy.

931
01:01:54.152 --> 01:01:57.029
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

932
01:01:57.196 --> 01:01:58.864
No, I'm not talking about me.

933
01:02:00.533 --> 01:02:02.451
But, you know, he's got personality.

934
01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:04.077
Personality?

935
01:02:05.538 --> 01:02:08.540
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

936
01:02:08.708 --> 01:02:12.044
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

937
01:02:12.211 --> 01:02:14.630
I just said he was talented,
you're unbelievable.

938
01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:17.299
Just leave it alone now,
I understand what you said.

939
01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.509
He's talented. Leave it at that.

940
01:03:58.151 --> 01:04:00.360
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

941
01:04:17.003 --> 01:04:19.296
What did you hear about that thing?

942
01:04:19.964 --> 01:04:23.008
- The Brooklyn thing?
- No, the guy from downtown.

943
01:04:23.676 --> 01:04:26.845
- The guy from where Christie lived?
- No.

944
01:04:27.972 --> 01:04:31.183
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

945
01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.852
- Know the guy I mean?
- Yeah.

946
01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:38.106
His name was Batts. His people
are driving everyone crazy looking for him.

947
01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:39.983
Nobody knows what happened to him.

948
01:04:40.151 --> 01:04:44.196
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared. That was it.

949
01:04:46.032 --> 01:04:50.202
All right. Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

950
01:04:50.703 --> 01:04:52.704
- All right?
- Yeah.

951
01:04:55.208 --> 01:04:57.292
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

952
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:05.133
I want my money.

953
01:05:06.219 --> 01:05:07.594
He owes it.

954
01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:19.272
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

955
01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.776
- Paulie was talking about that.
- Got to get it out of there.

956
01:05:23.444 --> 01:05:26.071
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

957
01:05:26.239 --> 01:05:29.908
- It's been six months.
- We got to get it out of there right away.

958
01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:46.758
Henry, hurry up. My mother's
making fried peppers and sausage for us.

959
01:05:50.304 --> 01:05:52.556
- Here's an arm.
- Very funny, guys.

960
01:05:52.723 --> 01:05:54.099
Here's a leg.

961
01:05:54.267 --> 01:05:55.767
Here's a wing.

962
01:05:56.477 --> 01:06:00.438
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

963
01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:03.942
Oh, that's so bad.

964
01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.364
Ah!

965
01:06:10.741 --> 01:06:12.617
What happened to the car?

966
01:06:13.077 --> 01:06:14.744
I hit a skunk, all right?

967
01:06:14.912 --> 01:06:16.621
Go with your mother.

968
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:19.499
Ew! It's disgusting, Henry.

969
01:06:23.629 --> 01:06:26.548
<i>I set up Janice in an apartment
around the corner from The Suite.</i>

970
01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:29.342
<i>That way I was able to stay over
a couple of nights a week.</i>

971
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:30.760
This is my new antique lamp.

972
01:06:30.928 --> 01:06:33.972
<i>Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.</i>

973
01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:35.974
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

974
01:06:36.142 --> 01:06:37.767
Looks like Roma.

975
01:06:37.935 --> 01:06:40.186
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

976
01:06:42.189 --> 01:06:43.982
Come see my bedroom.

977
01:06:44.692 --> 01:06:48.528
- Tommy, will you take him?
- I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

978
01:06:52.491 --> 01:06:54.659
Love that crystal ball or what?

979
01:06:56.162 --> 01:06:59.122
This is where we spend most of our time.

980
01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:03.209
I love the floral arrangements.

981
01:07:05.212 --> 01:07:06.254
French.

982
01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:10.342
<i>Janice and I were having so much
fun, she started screwing up at work.</i>

983
01:07:10.509 --> 01:07:12.969
<i>I had to straighten out her boss
a little bit.</i>

984
01:07:13.137 --> 01:07:16.681
Janice can do what she wants to do.
Got it?

985
01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:21.227
Just try to run. Hang up once more,
and you'll deal with me.

986
01:07:26.817 --> 01:07:29.027
Come on, get off of her.

987
01:07:29.362 --> 01:07:31.071
You're an animal.

988
01:07:44.043 --> 01:07:47.796
Spider, on your way over here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

989
01:07:50.216 --> 01:07:52.550
- Did you guys eat?
- I'm starving.

990
01:07:54.053 --> 01:07:56.054
- I'll play these.
- You'll play those?

991
01:07:56.222 --> 01:07:58.223
Do I stutter? I play those.

992
01:08:02.228 --> 01:08:04.229
What am I? A mirage?

993
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.107
Where's my fucking drink?
I asked you for a drink.

994
01:08:07.274 --> 01:08:09.943
- You wanted a drink?
- I asked you for one.

995
01:08:10.111 --> 01:08:13.029
I thought you said,
"I'm all right, Spider."

996
01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:15.740
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

997
01:08:15.908 --> 01:08:20.120
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

998
01:08:20.287 --> 01:08:23.581
- I thought it was Henry.
- You're a mumbling, stuttering little fuck.

999
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:25.834
I thought you said,
"I'm all right, Spider."

1000
01:08:26.002 --> 01:08:27.669
You ain't all right.

1001
01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:30.005
No, I thought you said you were all right.

1002
01:08:30.172 --> 01:08:33.091
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

1003
01:08:35.219 --> 01:08:38.304
You've been doing this all fucking night
to me, you motherfucker!

1004
01:08:38.472 --> 01:08:40.640
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

1005
01:08:40.808 --> 01:08:43.435
Go get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you little prick.

1006
01:08:43.602 --> 01:08:46.187
You walk like fucking Stepin Fetchit.

1007
01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:47.939
For everybody else you run.

1008
01:08:48.107 --> 01:08:52.110
Run for me, you prick!
Dance, dance the fucking drink back here!

1009
01:08:52.278 --> 01:08:54.029
What's that movie that Bogart made?

1010
01:08:54.196 --> 01:08:56.823
- Where he played a cowboy.
<i>- The Oklahoma Kid.</i>

1011
01:08:56.991 --> 01:09:01.036
<i>- Shane?
- Oklahoma Kid, that's me!</i>

1012
01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.788
You fucking varmint. Dance!

1013
01:09:03.956 --> 01:09:05.957
Yahoo, you motherfucker!

1014
01:09:06.459 --> 01:09:08.626
Round up those fucking wagons.

1015
01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:16.342
Now he's moving.

1016
01:09:17.303 --> 01:09:19.929
- Henry, what happened?
- He shot him in the foot, Tommy.

1017
01:09:20.097 --> 01:09:24.309
He's fucking fine. So he got shot in
the foot. What is it? A big fucking deal?

1018
01:09:24.477 --> 01:09:27.020
- Get a towel.
- Nice fucking game.

1019
01:09:28.522 --> 01:09:33.276
Take him to Ben Casey, the little prick.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

1020
01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:36.488
Take him to the doctor down the street.

1021
01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.656
Bones are all shattered.

1022
01:09:38.824 --> 01:09:40.617
Don't get me upset, now.

1023
01:09:40.785 --> 01:09:44.329
Don't make a big fucking thing out of it,
Spider, you little prick.

1024
01:09:44.497 --> 01:09:47.165
You trying to make me think
what the fuck I did here.

1025
01:09:47.333 --> 01:09:49.209
It was an accident.

1026
01:09:49.543 --> 01:09:51.753
- Little fucking actor.
- I got a great hand here.

1027
01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.338
- You in or out?
- Yeah, I'm in.

1028
01:09:53.506 --> 01:09:55.381
- $800.
- $800?

1029
01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:59.886
You haven't been home in
two weeks. You're not going out tonight!

1030
01:10:00.387 --> 01:10:03.515
Karen, will you grow up! Stop!
I'm still gonna go out!

1031
01:10:03.682 --> 01:10:05.558
Not without your car keys, you're not.

1032
01:10:05.726 --> 01:10:07.727
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1033
01:10:07.895 --> 01:10:10.105
Yes, I'm nuts. Something's going on.

1034
01:10:10.314 --> 01:10:13.191
- Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that.
- No!

1035
01:10:13.359 --> 01:10:17.070
I'm telling you, I look in your face
and I know that you're lying!

1036
01:10:19.323 --> 01:10:21.533
- Get out! Get out!
- Shut up.

1037
01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.826
Get out of my life!

1038
01:10:22.993 --> 01:10:25.954
You're fucked in the head, Karen.
This is all in your mind.

1039
01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:28.456
- You're a lousy bastard!
- You got a problem.

1040
01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:32.418
Go ahead, go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1041
01:10:32.670 --> 01:10:36.131
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!

1042
01:10:46.892 --> 01:10:48.726
Spider, what's your rush?

1043
01:10:51.272 --> 01:10:52.981
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Spider.

1044
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:57.402
Spider, that fucking bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1045
01:10:59.697 --> 01:11:03.491
Next thing you know, he's gonna be
coming in one of these fucking walkers.

1046
01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:05.410
Even though you got that, you can dance?

1047
01:11:05.578 --> 01:11:10.165
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter, you.

1048
01:11:10.416 --> 01:11:12.625
Tell the truth.
You're looking for sympathy?

1049
01:11:12.793 --> 01:11:15.086
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Tommy?

1050
01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:18.715
Whoa!

1051
01:11:19.758 --> 01:11:22.260
I didn't fucking hear right.
Can't believe what I heard.

1052
01:11:22.428 --> 01:11:24.929
Spider, here. This is for you. Attaboy.

1053
01:11:25.723 --> 01:11:28.725
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of fucking balls.

1054
01:11:28.893 --> 01:11:31.352
Good for you.
Don't take no shit off nobody.

1055
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:35.356
He shoots him in the foot,
he tells him to go fuck himself.

1056
01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:40.236
Are you gonna let this fucking punk
get away with that?

1057
01:11:40.404 --> 01:11:42.989
What's the matter?
What's the world coming to?

1058
01:11:46.577 --> 01:11:49.621
That's what the fucking world
is coming to. How do you like that?

1059
01:11:49.788 --> 01:11:53.041
- How's that, all right?
- What's the fucking matter with you?

1060
01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:55.126
What are you, stupid or what?

1061
01:11:55.294 --> 01:11:58.588
Tommy, I'm kidding with you.
Are you a fucking sick maniac?

1062
01:11:58.756 --> 01:12:01.716
How do I know if you're kidding?
You're breaking my fucking balls?

1063
01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:04.385
I'm fucking kidding with you,
you fucking shoot the guy?

1064
01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:05.762
He's dead.

1065
01:12:07.348 --> 01:12:09.557
Good shot. What do you want from me?
Good shot.

1066
01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:11.309
You can't miss at this distance.

1067
01:12:11.477 --> 01:12:13.269
You got a problem
with what I did, Anthony?

1068
01:12:13.437 --> 01:12:14.479
No.

1069
01:12:14.647 --> 01:12:18.358
Fucking rat. His whole family's
all rats. He would've grown up to be a rat.

1070
01:12:18.525 --> 01:12:20.693
Stupid bastard! I can't
fucking believe you.

1071
01:12:20.861 --> 01:12:24.739
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1072
01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:29.077
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?

1073
01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:32.163
I'll dig the fucking hole.
Where are the shovels?

1074
01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:34.749
- Hello.
- Hello?

1075
01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:37.210
This is Karen Hill. I wanna talk to you.

1076
01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:41.339
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1077
01:12:41.507 --> 01:12:43.341
<i>I want to talk to you!</i>

1078
01:12:43.634 --> 01:12:45.551
<i>You keep away from my husband,
you hear me?</i>

1079
01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.181
<i>Hello? Open the door!</i>

1080
01:12:52.059 --> 01:12:53.518
Answer me!

1081
01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:56.437
I'm gonna tell everyone
who walks in this building...

1082
01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:59.315
that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

1083
01:12:59.483 --> 01:13:01.109
Is this the superintendent?

1084
01:13:01.277 --> 01:13:03.653
Yes, I want you to know, sir,
that you have a whore...

1085
01:13:03.821 --> 01:13:05.363
<i>living in 2R!</i>

1086
01:13:05.531 --> 01:13:08.658
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1087
01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.618
<i>He's my husband!</i>

1088
01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:13.496
<i>Get your own goddamn man!</i>

1089
01:13:14.707 --> 01:13:16.249
Wake up, Henry.

1090
01:13:25.718 --> 01:13:27.051
Karen...

1091
01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.389
What are you doing?

1092
01:13:34.018 --> 01:13:36.936
- Karen, are you crazy?
- I am crazy.

1093
01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:40.857
I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1094
01:13:43.736 --> 01:13:45.528
Karen, take it easy.

1095
01:13:49.033 --> 01:13:50.992
- Okay?
- Do you love her?

1096
01:13:52.578 --> 01:13:53.745
Do you?

1097
01:13:54.788 --> 01:13:56.873
- Do you?
- Karen...

1098
01:13:59.126 --> 01:14:01.586
I love you. You know I love you.

1099
01:14:02.755 --> 01:14:04.464
You don't.

1100
01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:07.717
No, you don't.

1101
01:14:08.344 --> 01:14:11.054
Please, be careful. Baby, don't.

1102
01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:15.141
<i>But still I couldn't hurt him.
How could I hurt him?</i>

1103
01:14:15.309 --> 01:14:18.019
<i>I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.</i>

1104
01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:19.604
<i>The truth was...</i>

1105
01:14:19.772 --> 01:14:22.065
<i>that no matter how bad I felt...</i>

1106
01:14:22.775 --> 01:14:25.276
<i>I was still very attracted to him.</i>

1107
01:14:26.445 --> 01:14:28.780
<i>Why should I give him to someone else?</i>

1108
01:14:28.947 --> 01:14:30.782
<i>Why should she win?</i>

1109
01:14:34.495 --> 01:14:36.371
Just put it down.

1110
01:14:37.539 --> 01:14:39.957
You know I love you, don't you?

1111
01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:42.293
You're all I want, Karen.

1112
01:14:43.712 --> 01:14:45.922
Please put the gun down, Karen.

1113
01:14:46.799 --> 01:14:49.467
Baby, come on.

1114
01:14:52.471 --> 01:14:54.071
Shh.

1115
01:15:03.399 --> 01:15:05.775
What are you, fucking crazy, Karen?

1116
01:15:07.152 --> 01:15:09.946
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1117
01:15:10.114 --> 01:15:13.783
I got to fucking come home for this?

1118
01:15:14.326 --> 01:15:16.327
I should fucking kill you!

1119
01:15:17.621 --> 01:15:19.455
How does it feel?

1120
01:15:20.499 --> 01:15:22.458
How does it feel, Karen?

1121
01:15:39.059 --> 01:15:41.018
I'm sorry!

1122
01:15:48.026 --> 01:15:49.986
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1123
01:15:50.863 --> 01:15:53.865
- Looking good.
- Thank you. Good to see you.

1124
01:15:54.032 --> 01:15:56.492
- Hi, Paulie!
- Hi, honey. How are you?

1125
01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:57.660
Good.

1126
01:15:57.828 --> 01:16:00.496
- Why don't you go get cigarettes, okay?
- Sure.

1127
01:16:01.373 --> 01:16:03.833
- Any of you need anything?
- I'm all right.

1128
01:16:04.209 --> 01:16:07.044
- Want anything to drink? A beer?
- No.

1129
01:16:07.212 --> 01:16:09.797
- Chinese food?
- No, come on, sit down.

1130
01:16:16.555 --> 01:16:19.390
Karen came to the house.
She's very upset.

1131
01:16:21.435 --> 01:16:22.871
You gotta straighten this thing out.

1132
01:16:22.895 --> 01:16:26.147
We got to have calm now. We don't know
what the hell she's gonna do.

1133
01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:28.566
She's getting all hysterical.
She gets very excited.

1134
01:16:28.734 --> 01:16:32.612
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1135
01:16:33.572 --> 01:16:36.949
I'm not saying you gotta back to her
this minute, but you gotta go back.

1136
01:16:37.117 --> 01:16:39.577
It's the only way.
You gotta keep up appearances.

1137
01:16:39.745 --> 01:16:42.205
The two of them
come over every day, commiserating.

1138
01:16:42.372 --> 01:16:44.332
I can't have it.

1139
01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:47.835
I can't do it, Henry.

1140
01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:51.088
Nobody says that you can't do
what you wanna do.

1141
01:16:51.256 --> 01:16:53.883
We all know that. I
mean, this is what it is.

1142
01:16:54.051 --> 01:16:56.802
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.

1143
01:16:56.970 --> 01:16:59.305
You have to go home to the family,
you understand?

1144
01:16:59.473 --> 01:17:02.099
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1145
01:17:02.392 --> 01:17:04.602
You gotta go home. Smarten up.

1146
01:17:05.312 --> 01:17:06.854
- All right?
- All right.

1147
01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:08.564
I'm gonna talk to Karen.

1148
01:17:08.732 --> 01:17:12.276
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

1149
01:17:12.778 --> 01:17:14.779
I'm gonna tell her you'll go back to her...

1150
01:17:14.947 --> 01:17:17.823
and it'll be just the way
it was when you were first married...

1151
01:17:17.991 --> 01:17:19.867
your romance, it's gonna be beautiful.

1152
01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:22.036
I know how to talk to her,
especially to her.

1153
01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:24.664
Jimmy and Tommy are going down
to Tampa this weekend...

1154
01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:25.957
to pick up something for me.

1155
01:17:26.124 --> 01:17:27.833
Instead, you go with Jimmy.

1156
01:17:28.001 --> 01:17:29.293
You come with me, we'll go down.

1157
01:17:29.461 --> 01:17:31.963
Have a good time.
Take some time for yourself. Relax.

1158
01:17:32.130 --> 01:17:33.965
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

1159
01:17:34.132 --> 01:17:35.967
- We'll have a good time.
- Enjoy yourselves.

1160
01:17:36.134 --> 01:17:39.262
And when you come back,
you go back to Karen. Huh?

1161
01:17:39.429 --> 01:17:41.138
Please, there's no other way.

1162
01:17:41.306 --> 01:17:43.891
You're not gonna get a divorce.
We're not <i>animali.</i>

1163
01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:46.644
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1164
01:17:48.438 --> 01:17:51.315
She'll kill him, but she won't divorce him.

1165
01:17:55.654 --> 01:17:57.321
{\an8}You gonna pay us?

1166
01:18:03.662 --> 01:18:06.706
- You gonna pay?
- Give us the fucking money!

1167
01:18:06.873 --> 01:18:09.292
I can't, I swear.

1168
01:18:10.836 --> 01:18:12.128
Let's go.

1169
01:18:20.679 --> 01:18:23.347
- We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
- No!

1170
01:18:23.515 --> 01:18:26.225
What fucking lions?
I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!

1171
01:18:26.393 --> 01:18:28.728
- Let's throw him over the moat.
- All right.

1172
01:18:28.895 --> 01:18:30.271
I'll get the money!

1173
01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:33.065
<i>They must really feed each other
to the lions down there...</i>

1174
01:18:33.233 --> 01:18:34.984
<i>because the guy gave the money right up.</i>

1175
01:18:35.152 --> 01:18:36.777
I swear to Christ, I'll get the money.

1176
01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:39.071
<i>We got to spend the rest of the weekend
at the track.</i>

1177
01:18:39.698 --> 01:18:40.823
Yeah. They mean business.

1178
01:18:40.991 --> 01:18:43.618
<i>Then, I couldn't believe what happened.</i>

1179
01:18:44.036 --> 01:18:46.537
<i>When we got home,
we were all over the newspaper.</i>

1180
01:18:46.705 --> 01:18:49.915
<i>At first, I didn't even know
why we got picked up.</i>

1181
01:18:50.083 --> 01:18:52.209
<i>Then I found out
that the guy we roughed up...</i>

1182
01:18:52.377 --> 01:18:55.755
<i>turned out to have a sister
working as a typist for the FBI.</i>

1183
01:18:55.922 --> 01:18:58.716
<i>Who could believe it?
Of all the fucking people.</i>

1184
01:18:58.884 --> 01:19:02.178
<i>She gave up everybody:
Jimmy, me, even her brother.</i>

1185
01:19:03.555 --> 01:19:06.432
<i>It took the jury six hours
to bring us in guilty.</i>

1186
01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.852
<i>The judge gave Jimmy and me 10 years
like he was giving away candy.</i>

1187
01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:12.688
...ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1188
01:19:12.898 --> 01:19:15.858
You will now be turned over to the
United States Attorney General's Office.

1189
01:19:21.239 --> 01:19:22.865
Toast, guys.

1190
01:19:23.033 --> 01:19:25.368
Good trip, good life, get out soon.

1191
01:19:25.535 --> 01:19:27.411
Good trip, sweetheart.

1192
01:19:30.332 --> 01:19:32.416
We'll watch the home front.

1193
01:19:33.919 --> 01:19:36.379
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1194
01:19:37.422 --> 01:19:40.591
Yeah, motherfuck them
every chance you get.

1195
01:19:46.431 --> 01:19:48.974
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1196
01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:02.655
Now take me to jail.

1197
01:20:07.327 --> 01:20:10.121
<i>In prison, dinner was always a big thing.</i>

1198
01:20:10.455 --> 01:20:13.999
<i>We had a pasta course,
and then we had a meat or a fish.</i>

1199
01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:17.461
<i>Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt...</i>

1200
01:20:17.629 --> 01:20:19.964
<i>and had this wonderful system
for doing the garlic.</i>

1201
01:20:20.132 --> 01:20:23.134
<i>He used a razor,
and he used to slice it so thin...</i>

1202
01:20:23.301 --> 01:20:26.095
<i>that it used to liquefy in the pan
with just a little oil.</i>

1203
01:20:26.263 --> 01:20:28.222
<i>It was a very good system.</i>

1204
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:30.891
<i>Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.</i>

1205
01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:32.476
Get the smell?

1206
01:20:32.644 --> 01:20:35.354
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:

1207
01:20:35.522 --> 01:20:37.565
Veal, beef, and pork.

1208
01:20:37.941 --> 01:20:40.025
Good, but you gotta have the pork.

1209
01:20:40.193 --> 01:20:41.736
That's the flavor.

1210
01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:45.364
<i>I felt he used too many onions,
but it was still a very good sauce.</i>

1211
01:20:45.532 --> 01:20:48.325
Vinnie, don't put too many onions
in the sauce.

1212
01:20:48.493 --> 01:20:51.078
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1213
01:20:51.371 --> 01:20:53.164
Put three small onions, that's all I did.

1214
01:20:53.331 --> 01:20:55.875
Three onions? How many cans
of tomatoes you put in there?

1215
01:20:56.042 --> 01:20:58.794
- I put two big cans.
- You don't need three onions.

1216
01:20:58.962 --> 01:21:00.963
<i>Johnny Dio did the meat.</i>

1217
01:21:01.131 --> 01:21:03.716
<i>We had no broiler,
so Johnny did everything in pans.</i>

1218
01:21:03.884 --> 01:21:06.010
<i>It used to smell up the joint
something awful...</i>

1219
01:21:06.178 --> 01:21:09.138
<i>and the hacks used to die,
but he still cooked a great steak.</i>

1220
01:21:09.306 --> 01:21:11.849
- How do you like yours?
- Medium rare.

1221
01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:14.560
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1222
01:21:14.978 --> 01:21:18.731
<i>You know, when you think
of prison you get pictures in your mind...</i>

1223
01:21:18.899 --> 01:21:22.526
<i>of all those old movies
with rows of guys behind bars.</i>

1224
01:21:22.694 --> 01:21:24.612
<i>It wasn't like that for wiseguys.</i>

1225
01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.448
<i>It really wasn't that bad,
excepting that I missed Jimmy...</i>

1226
01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:29.033
<i>who was doing his time in Atlanta.</i>

1227
01:21:29.201 --> 01:21:31.702
Give me two steaks
while you're in there, all right?

1228
01:21:33.038 --> 01:21:37.500
<i>Everyone else in the joint was doing real
time, mixed together, living like pigs.</i>

1229
01:21:37.667 --> 01:21:40.669
<i>But we lived alone. We owned the joint.</i>

1230
01:21:40.837 --> 01:21:44.215
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1231
01:21:44.382 --> 01:21:45.716
Good, they deserved it.

1232
01:21:45.884 --> 01:21:49.178
<i>Even the hacks we couldn't bribe
would never rat on the guys we did.</i>

1233
01:21:49.346 --> 01:21:51.305
...had respect. People loved one another.

1234
01:21:51.473 --> 01:21:53.682
- They left their doors open.
- Sorry it took so long.

1235
01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:56.352
The skinny guard's getting to be
a real pain in the ass.

1236
01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.730
- We're gonna have to do something.
- I took care of him.

1237
01:21:59.898 --> 01:22:01.607
What'd you bring?

1238
01:22:01.775 --> 01:22:03.901
- Bread.
- Good. Fresh.

1239
01:22:04.069 --> 01:22:05.861
Vinnie, I got your peppers and onions.

1240
01:22:06.029 --> 01:22:08.322
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1241
01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:09.990
Come on, what else?

1242
01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:11.659
- Scotch.
- Nice.

1243
01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:14.495
- Some red wine.
- Okay.

1244
01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:16.705
- Now we can eat.
- I got some white, too.

1245
01:22:16.873 --> 01:22:18.624
Give me the white, too. Beautiful.

1246
01:22:18.792 --> 01:22:21.794
Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, it's ready, Vinnie.

1247
01:22:22.379 --> 01:22:23.462
Some more bread.

1248
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:26.298
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1249
01:22:26.466 --> 01:22:28.551
- You must be kidding.
- Believe me.

1250
01:22:37.811 --> 01:22:39.436
What are you doing?

1251
01:22:44.568 --> 01:22:46.443
I'll take that.

1252
01:22:48.822 --> 01:22:51.282
- All right, I'll catch you guys later.
- Yeah.

1253
01:22:51.449 --> 01:22:53.784
You going for a walk in the park?

1254
01:22:55.287 --> 01:22:58.455
- Okay, I'll catch you next week. Thanks.
- Okay.

1255
01:23:01.293 --> 01:23:03.836
- Is there any more?
- No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1256
01:23:04.004 --> 01:23:05.044
- Thanks.
- You too, Henry.

1257
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:15.055
Mrs. Hill, come here.

1258
01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:16.390
Come on.

1259
01:23:19.769 --> 01:23:21.812
You girls stay right here.

1260
01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:25.482
- I want you to hold hands.
- Okay, go right up to the front.

1261
01:23:25.817 --> 01:23:27.735
- Let's go.
- How you doing?

1262
01:23:27.903 --> 01:23:30.321
- Good, how are you?
- Very well, thank you.

1263
01:23:42.375 --> 01:23:44.835
- What you talking about?
- I saw her name in the register.

1264
01:23:45.003 --> 01:23:47.171
- Jesus Christ.
- You want her to visit you?

1265
01:23:47.339 --> 01:23:51.008
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing letters to the parole board.

1266
01:23:51.176 --> 01:23:54.345
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

1267
01:23:54.512 --> 01:23:56.722
I can't stop people
from coming to see me.

1268
01:23:56.890 --> 01:24:00.184
Good, let her sneak this stuff in
for you every week.

1269
01:24:00.352 --> 01:24:03.979
- Let her fight these bastards every week!
- Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1270
01:24:05.732 --> 01:24:07.691
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.

1271
01:24:08.193 --> 01:24:10.653
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1272
01:24:11.696 --> 01:24:13.530
Will you stop it, Karen?

1273
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:16.533
- Let her do it!
- Stop it!

1274
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:28.087
Nobody's helping me. I'm all alone.

1275
01:24:29.047 --> 01:24:31.048
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1276
01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:34.677
I asked your friend Remo
for the money that he owes you.

1277
01:24:34.844 --> 01:24:36.220
You know what he told me?

1278
01:24:36.388 --> 01:24:39.974
He told me to take my kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

1279
01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:42.101
It's gonna be okay.

1280
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:46.397
Even Paulie, since he got out, I've never
seen him. I never see anybody anymore.

1281
01:24:46.564 --> 01:24:49.358
It's only you and me.
That's what happens when you go away.

1282
01:24:49.526 --> 01:24:53.529
I told you that we're on our own.
Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

1283
01:24:54.531 --> 01:24:58.534
As long as he's on parole,
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1284
01:25:00.996 --> 01:25:03.247
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can. Listen to me.

1285
01:25:03.415 --> 01:25:06.000
All I need is for you
is to keep bringing me the stuff.

1286
01:25:06.167 --> 01:25:08.752
I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh
who'll help me move it.

1287
01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.546
In a month we're gonna be fine.

1288
01:25:10.714 --> 01:25:13.132
- We won't need anybody.
- I'm afraid.

1289
01:25:13.299 --> 01:25:15.259
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...

1290
01:25:15.427 --> 01:25:16.719
Don't worry about him.

1291
01:25:16.886 --> 01:25:20.431
He is not helping us out.
Is he putting any food on the table?

1292
01:25:21.599 --> 01:25:23.058
We've gotta help each other.

1293
01:25:23.226 --> 01:25:26.895
We've just gotta be really careful
while we do it.

1294
01:25:31.568 --> 01:25:33.777
I don't want to hear a word
about her anymore.

1295
01:25:33.945 --> 01:25:34.945
Never.

1296
01:26:00.346 --> 01:26:02.014
Daddy!

1297
01:26:03.641 --> 01:26:05.893
- We missed you.
- Are you here to stay?

1298
01:26:06.061 --> 01:26:09.646
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1299
01:26:09.814 --> 01:26:11.231
I did the sun.

1300
01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:15.319
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

1301
01:26:16.154 --> 01:26:17.988
Do you like the house?

1302
01:26:19.282 --> 01:26:21.325
Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.

1303
01:26:21.493 --> 01:26:22.534
With what?

1304
01:26:22.744 --> 01:26:25.829
Don't worry, with what.
Just start looking for a new house.

1305
01:26:25.997 --> 01:26:29.416
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
Those guys there owe me $15,000.

1306
01:26:29.584 --> 01:26:31.502
We'll be all right. I got things lined up.

1307
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:34.338
Pittsburgh? You have to go see
your parole officer tomorrow.

1308
01:26:34.506 --> 01:26:37.424
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1309
01:26:38.134 --> 01:26:40.511
- Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
- Me!

1310
01:26:50.814 --> 01:26:52.397
What do you want?

1311
01:26:52.649 --> 01:26:54.691
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1312
01:26:58.154 --> 01:27:01.031
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1313
01:27:03.159 --> 01:27:05.035
I don't want any more of that shit.

1314
01:27:05.203 --> 01:27:06.203
What shit?

1315
01:27:06.371 --> 01:27:08.956
- Just stay away from the garbage.
- Look, Paulie...

1316
01:27:09.124 --> 01:27:12.334
I'm not talking about what you did inside.
You did what you had to do.

1317
01:27:12.502 --> 01:27:15.045
I'm talking about now. From now.
Here and now.

1318
01:27:16.089 --> 01:27:18.841
- Why would I get into that?
- Don't make a jerk out of me.

1319
01:27:19.008 --> 01:27:20.551
Just don't do it.

1320
01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:27.266
I want to talk to you about Jimmy.
You gotta watch out for him.

1321
01:27:27.433 --> 01:27:30.185
He's a good earner, but he's wild,
takes too many chances.

1322
01:27:30.353 --> 01:27:32.813
I know Jimmy. You think
I would take chances like him?

1323
01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:34.731
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.

1324
01:27:34.899 --> 01:27:36.650
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.

1325
01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:38.443
You gotta watch out for kids like this.

1326
01:27:38.611 --> 01:27:41.238
I know what they are.
I only use them for certain things.

1327
01:27:41.406 --> 01:27:43.907
I ain't gonna get fucked like Gribbs,
you understand?

1328
01:27:44.075 --> 01:27:48.412
Gribbs is 70 years old. The fucking guy's
gonna die in prison. I don't need that.

1329
01:27:48.746 --> 01:27:52.624
So I'm warning everybody. Everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1330
01:27:53.168 --> 01:27:55.711
Gribbs got 20 years just
for saying hello to some fuck...

1331
01:27:55.879 --> 01:27:57.963
who was sneaking behind his back,
selling junk.

1332
01:27:58.131 --> 01:28:00.591
I don't need that.
That won't happen to me, understand?

1333
01:28:00.758 --> 01:28:02.885
You know you're out early
because I got you a job.

1334
01:28:03.052 --> 01:28:05.053
I don't need this heat,
you understand that?

1335
01:28:05.221 --> 01:28:09.099
You see anybody fucking around
with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?

1336
01:28:09.267 --> 01:28:10.392
That means anybody.

1337
01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.560
- All right.
- Yeah?

1338
01:28:11.728 --> 01:28:13.228
Yeah. Of course.

1339
01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.779
<i>Took me about a week
of sneaking around...</i>

1340
01:28:22.947 --> 01:28:24.781
<i>before I could unload
the Pittsburgh stuff.</i>

1341
01:28:24.949 --> 01:28:27.409
<i>But when I did, it was a real score.</i>

1342
01:28:27.577 --> 01:28:30.120
<i>I started using Sandy's place
to mix the stuff.</i>

1343
01:28:30.288 --> 01:28:32.706
<i>And even with Sandy snorting
more than she mixed...</i>

1344
01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:35.500
<i>I could see that
this was a really good business.</i>

1345
01:28:35.668 --> 01:28:38.086
<i>I made $12,000 in my second week.</i>

1346
01:28:38.671 --> 01:28:41.757
<i>I had a down payment on my house
and things were really rolling.</i>

1347
01:28:41.925 --> 01:28:46.136
<i>All I had to do was every once in a while
tell Sandy that I loved her.</i>

1348
01:28:49.766 --> 01:28:51.808
<i>But it was perfect, I'm telling you.</i>

1349
01:28:51.976 --> 01:28:54.353
<i>As long as I kept getting
the stuff from Pittsburgh...</i>

1350
01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.230
<i>I knew Paulie would never find out.</i>

1351
01:28:56.397 --> 01:29:00.317
<i>Within a couple of weeks,
it got so big I needed some help.</i>

1352
01:29:00.652 --> 01:29:03.445
<i>So I got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.</i>

1353
01:29:03.821 --> 01:29:05.364
It's fucking great.

1354
01:29:05.615 --> 01:29:06.823
Mr. Conway.

1355
01:29:12.664 --> 01:29:14.581
- Bring your pay slips?
- Yeah.

1356
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:20.003
Four and a half months of dirt.

1357
01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:23.131
- It's so good.
- I did it.

1358
01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:26.885
- Do you love it?
- It's wonderful.

1359
01:29:27.345 --> 01:29:31.098
And this we just had to have
made special. Go ahead, sit in it, Belle.

1360
01:29:31.266 --> 01:29:33.809
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1361
01:29:34.018 --> 01:29:35.519
Okay, you ready?

1362
01:29:35.687 --> 01:29:37.854
Watch the wall with the rock.

1363
01:29:45.488 --> 01:29:48.282
The electricians did it special. Come on.

1364
01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:51.201
Come on. All right.

1365
01:29:51.369 --> 01:29:54.997
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1366
01:29:55.164 --> 01:29:56.498
It's nice, huh?

1367
01:29:56.666 --> 01:29:58.709
Henry, come over here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?

1368
01:29:58.876 --> 01:30:01.336
I talked to him,
and he's looking into everything.

1369
01:30:01.504 --> 01:30:04.715
This'll make the Air France haul
look like goddamn peanuts.

1370
01:30:04.882 --> 01:30:07.134
- Shh! Come on.
- He's gonna do it, right?

1371
01:30:07.302 --> 01:30:09.052
I told you. He'll check everything out.

1372
01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.888
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1373
01:30:12.056 --> 01:30:16.226
I know. Do you understand?
There's millions in there. And I've been...

1374
01:30:16.394 --> 01:30:20.022
bleeding for this caper, been cultivating
this son of a bitch for two years.

1375
01:30:20.231 --> 01:30:23.275
He owes me $20,000. Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.

1376
01:30:23.443 --> 01:30:27.321
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1377
01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:29.573
Morrie, let's get a drink.

1378
01:30:30.241 --> 01:30:33.041
<i>These are the guys that Jimmy
put together for what turned out to be...</i>

1379
01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:37.039
<i>the biggest heist in American history:
The Lufthansa heist.</i>

1380
01:30:38.291 --> 01:30:41.001
<i>Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab
the outside guard...</i>

1381
01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:43.670
<i>and make him get us in the front door.</i>

1382
01:30:44.922 --> 01:30:48.216
<i>Frenchy and Joe Buddha
had to round up the workers.</i>

1383
01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:52.929
<i>Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them
all tied up and away from the alarms.</i>

1384
01:30:53.556 --> 01:30:55.766
<i>Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.</i>

1385
01:30:55.933 --> 01:30:59.436
<i>He used to hang around the lounge
and play guitar. Everybody loved Stacks.</i>

1386
01:30:59.604 --> 01:31:02.064
<i>What he was supposed to do
was steal the panel truck...</i>

1387
01:31:02.231 --> 01:31:05.359
<i>and afterwards compact it
by a friend of ours out in Jersey.</i>

1388
01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:07.903
<i>Only Morrie was driving us nuts.</i>

1389
01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:10.072
Morrie, have a drink and shut up.

1390
01:31:10.239 --> 01:31:13.283
<i>Just because he set this up,
he felt he could bust Jimmy's balls...</i>

1391
01:31:13.451 --> 01:31:15.994
<i>for an advance on the money
we were going to steal.</i>

1392
01:31:16.162 --> 01:31:19.790
<i>He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.</i>

1393
01:31:26.631 --> 01:31:30.759
<i>I had everybody working for me.
Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.</i>

1394
01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:35.138
Did you have a good flight?

1395
01:31:35.306 --> 01:31:37.808
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where did you find such creeps?

1396
01:31:38.017 --> 01:31:40.018
Come on, they're not that bad.

1397
01:31:41.145 --> 01:31:43.021
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1398
01:31:43.314 --> 01:31:45.774
Is this the same baby you used last week?

1399
01:31:45.942 --> 01:31:49.027
No, that one was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.

1400
01:31:49.987 --> 01:31:51.154
Big yawn.

1401
01:31:51.322 --> 01:31:53.073
She looks just like you.

1402
01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:56.076
That's what the stewardess said.

1403
01:32:08.714 --> 01:32:10.674
Take it easy, Sandy.

1404
01:32:10.842 --> 01:32:13.552
Come on, give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.

1405
01:32:13.719 --> 01:32:17.055
You got all day. Just make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

1406
01:32:17.515 --> 01:32:19.349
- I got to go.
- Where are you going?

1407
01:32:19.517 --> 01:32:23.603
Don't start. You know I gotta go
do this thing. Fuck, where are my keys?

1408
01:32:24.897 --> 01:32:26.273
Over there.

1409
01:32:26.441 --> 01:32:28.150
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.

1410
01:32:28.317 --> 01:32:30.360
What do you think
I got you the dishwasher for?

1411
01:32:30.528 --> 01:32:32.320
I hate doing the dishes. Fucks up my nails.

1412
01:32:32.488 --> 01:32:34.197
How could you hate it?
You got to be smart.

1413
01:32:34.365 --> 01:32:37.534
Look at all this powder around here.
That could put us away forever.

1414
01:32:37.702 --> 01:32:39.911
- Loosen up.
- Whoa, what are you doing?

1415
01:32:41.038 --> 01:32:44.374
- You know, I gotta...
- You don't have to go anywhere.

1416
01:32:45.543 --> 01:32:47.043
Make them wait.

1417
01:32:56.053 --> 01:32:57.804
<i>Nobody knows for sure...</i>

1418
01:32:57.972 --> 01:33:00.098
<i>just how much was taken
in the daring pre-dawn raid...</i>

1419
01:33:00.266 --> 01:33:02.893
<i>at the Lufthansa cargo terminal
at Kennedy Airport.</i>

1420
01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:06.771
<i>The FBI says $2 million,
Port Authority Police say $4 million...</i>

1421
01:33:10.109 --> 01:33:12.194
Jimmy!

1422
01:33:12.361 --> 01:33:14.196
Those sons of bitches!

1423
01:33:14.363 --> 01:33:16.698
<i>from the scene of the heist at JFK.</i>

1424
01:33:16.866 --> 01:33:20.494
<i>It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest
this town has ever seen.</i>

1425
01:33:22.413 --> 01:33:24.581
Come here, you! Come here!

1426
01:33:25.625 --> 01:33:28.335
Look at this genius. This genius!

1427
01:33:32.757 --> 01:33:34.424
Merry Christmas.

1428
01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.598
- Hello, who's this?
- That's my wife.

1429
01:33:42.558 --> 01:33:45.852
Come here.
I want to show you something, Jimmy.

1430
01:33:48.564 --> 01:33:49.940
Isn't she gorgeous?

1431
01:33:50.107 --> 01:33:53.276
I bought it for my wife.
It's a coupe. I love that car.

1432
01:33:56.113 --> 01:33:58.949
What did I tell you?
I talked to you before, didn't I?

1433
01:33:59.116 --> 01:34:00.450
Didn't I say what was going on?

1434
01:34:00.618 --> 01:34:02.702
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while?

1435
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:05.872
- The fucking car?
- It's a wedding gift from my mother.

1436
01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.166
It's under her name. I just got married.

1437
01:34:08.334 --> 01:34:11.127
- I love that car.
- Excuse me, darling, for just a second.

1438
01:34:11.295 --> 01:34:13.588
- I just got married.
- Are you nuts?

1439
01:34:13.756 --> 01:34:16.383
- What are you getting excited for?
- Are you stupid?

1440
01:34:16.551 --> 01:34:19.052
We got a million bulls out there.
Everybody's watching us.

1441
01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.096
And you get a fucking car. I'm excited?

1442
01:34:21.264 --> 01:34:23.306
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

1443
01:34:23.474 --> 01:34:25.517
I don't give a fuck. Are you stupid?

1444
01:34:25.685 --> 01:34:27.644
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.

1445
01:34:27.812 --> 01:34:31.523
Don't get anything. Nothing big.
What's the matter with you?

1446
01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:33.275
What are you getting excited for?

1447
01:34:33.442 --> 01:34:36.820
Because you're going to get us all
fucking pinched. What are you, stupid?

1448
01:34:36.988 --> 01:34:39.698
- What's the matter with you?
- I apologize.

1449
01:34:41.158 --> 01:34:44.369
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck is the matter with you?

1450
01:34:46.664 --> 01:34:47.998
I'm sorry.

1451
01:34:50.501 --> 01:34:54.004
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
It's under my mother's name.

1452
01:34:54.672 --> 01:34:57.340
What'd you say? You being
a fucking wise guy with me?

1453
01:34:57.508 --> 01:35:00.427
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- What did I tell you?

1454
01:35:00.845 --> 01:35:03.847
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1455
01:35:04.015 --> 01:35:05.640
Don't buy anything!

1456
01:35:05.808 --> 01:35:07.392
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1457
01:35:10.646 --> 01:35:13.064
The fat fuck, he ought to wear a sign.

1458
01:35:20.531 --> 01:35:22.866
I can't believe this.
Are you stupid or what?

1459
01:35:23.034 --> 01:35:24.367
Excuse me.

1460
01:35:24.619 --> 01:35:26.286
- What's the matter?
- Take it off.

1461
01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:29.414
- Why? What's the matter?
- Take it off!

1462
01:35:31.584 --> 01:35:35.128
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
and not to attract attention?

1463
01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:38.381
In two days, one guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1464
01:35:38.549 --> 01:35:40.425
- Bring it fucking back.
- I'll bring it back.

1465
01:35:40.593 --> 01:35:44.095
I don't care what you do.
Bring it where you got it before.

1466
01:35:44.263 --> 01:35:47.015
- Get it out of here!
- All right. Let's go, honey.

1467
01:35:51.228 --> 01:35:53.396
Shut the fuck up and let's go.

1468
01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.985
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

1469
01:36:00.905 --> 01:36:05.075
I'm gonna go see Stacks. Don't you look
at anybody or I'll fucking kill you.

1470
01:36:05.242 --> 01:36:09.454
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1471
01:36:09.705 --> 01:36:11.164
That's great.

1472
01:36:11.332 --> 01:36:14.417
Tell them all to relax.
Don't attract attention.

1473
01:36:17.463 --> 01:36:19.339
I've been looking all over for you.

1474
01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:21.091
How are you? Merry Christmas.

1475
01:36:21.258 --> 01:36:23.259
Listen, I need the money.

1476
01:36:23.678 --> 01:36:27.138
- Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
- Jimmy, I need the money.

1477
01:36:27.306 --> 01:36:29.474
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1478
01:36:29.642 --> 01:36:32.560
- I did what I had to do. I need the money.
- Not tonight, Morrie.

1479
01:36:32.728 --> 01:36:36.815
Listen, I did my caper. He owes me.
Everybody's flashing their stuff.

1480
01:36:36.982 --> 01:36:39.651
Evidently, they got their money.
I'm wearing the same shit.

1481
01:36:39.819 --> 01:36:43.113
- Just not tonight.
- They're wearing it. I gotta talk to him.

1482
01:36:45.616 --> 01:36:48.159
I got $500,000 coming to me.

1483
01:36:48.327 --> 01:36:50.787
The biggest fucking bundle
he ever made in his life.

1484
01:36:50.955 --> 01:36:53.581
Morrie, I'll go talk to him.
Go have a drink, all right?

1485
01:36:53.749 --> 01:36:55.834
- I'll talk to him.
- It's poison in my eyes.

1486
01:36:56.001 --> 01:36:58.920
- Morris, baby, are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

1487
01:37:04.635 --> 01:37:08.012
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1488
01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:12.559
We did it!

1489
01:37:15.563 --> 01:37:17.272
- Jimmy.
- Yeah.

1490
01:37:17.898 --> 01:37:19.816
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's me.

1491
01:37:19.984 --> 01:37:21.609
Pete? One second.

1492
01:37:22.486 --> 01:37:25.321
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

1493
01:37:25.489 --> 01:37:27.129
- Do what's right, you understand?
- Yeah.

1494
01:37:28.868 --> 01:37:30.827
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1495
01:37:31.328 --> 01:37:34.080
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1496
01:37:35.499 --> 01:37:39.169
- What do you think, Mommy?
- I love them all.

1497
01:37:39.336 --> 01:37:40.962
I love the gold outfit.

1498
01:37:41.130 --> 01:37:42.839
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

1499
01:37:43.007 --> 01:37:44.382
- What?
- Merry Christmas.

1500
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:45.842
And?

1501
01:37:46.177 --> 01:37:47.302
Happy Hanukkah.

1502
01:37:48.679 --> 01:37:49.679
Very funny.

1503
01:37:49.847 --> 01:37:51.931
Go get yourself something nice, okay?

1504
01:38:00.232 --> 01:38:04.611
<i>Lufthansa should have been our
ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.</i>

1505
01:38:05.196 --> 01:38:08.448
<i>$6 million in cash.
More than enough to go around.</i>

1506
01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:19.876
Yo, Stacks!

1507
01:38:20.252 --> 01:38:22.879
Open up! What's up? What're you doing?

1508
01:38:29.178 --> 01:38:33.056
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1509
01:38:33.224 --> 01:38:36.476
- You didn't bring any coffee?
- What do I look like, a fucking caterer?

1510
01:38:36.644 --> 01:38:39.562
Frankie will make coffee.
Go ahead, Frankie, make coffee.

1511
01:38:42.608 --> 01:38:44.734
Thought you had
one of your bitches in here.

1512
01:38:44.902 --> 01:38:47.278
Yeah, I did. Where the fuck is she?

1513
01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:51.282
Always got these hot books around,
or a bitch, or something.

1514
01:38:51.450 --> 01:38:52.659
What time is it?

1515
01:38:52.827 --> 01:38:56.788
- It's 11:30. We had to be there by 9:00.
- I'll be ready in a minute.

1516
01:38:56.956 --> 01:39:00.834
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own fucking funeral.

1517
01:39:05.798 --> 01:39:09.759
What the fuck you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1518
01:39:12.888 --> 01:39:14.764
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.

1519
01:39:14.932 --> 01:39:17.809
Put the fucking pot down.
You gonna take the coffee?

1520
01:39:37.621 --> 01:39:39.581
<i>Stacks was always crazy.</i>

1521
01:39:39.915 --> 01:39:43.585
<i>Instead of getting rid of the truck
as he was supposed to, he got stoned...</i>

1522
01:39:43.752 --> 01:39:48.298
<i>went to his girlfriend's, and by the time
he woke up, the cops had found the truck.</i>

1523
01:39:48.465 --> 01:39:50.550
<i>It was all over the television.</i>

1524
01:39:50.718 --> 01:39:53.720
<i>They even said they came up
with prints off the wheel.</i>

1525
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:57.891
<i>It was just a matter of time
before they got to Stacks.</i>

1526
01:40:09.653 --> 01:40:11.446
I gotta talk to you.

1527
01:40:11.655 --> 01:40:14.282
- Have a drink.
- Have a drink. Come on.

1528
01:40:14.783 --> 01:40:18.578
Have a drink. What you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1529
01:40:19.872 --> 01:40:21.956
I still gotta talk to you.

1530
01:40:22.291 --> 01:40:23.291
What?

1531
01:40:23.459 --> 01:40:25.960
- What happened with Stacks?
- Don't worry about that.

1532
01:40:26.128 --> 01:40:29.881
- There's feds all over the place.
- So what? Where are they gonna go?

1533
01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:32.967
- It's in the papers.
- He's worried.

1534
01:40:33.469 --> 01:40:34.677
What are you worried about?

1535
01:40:35.346 --> 01:40:38.806
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1536
01:40:38.974 --> 01:40:42.185
- What are you worried about?
- You worry too much.

1537
01:40:42.645 --> 01:40:45.146
Everything is beautiful.
There's nothing to worry about.

1538
01:40:45.314 --> 01:40:47.690
- Didn't you tell him?
- I didn't tell him yet.

1539
01:40:47.858 --> 01:40:49.317
- What?
- Guess what?

1540
01:40:50.861 --> 01:40:52.528
They're gonna make him.

1541
01:40:54.198 --> 01:40:56.157
Paulie's going to make you?

1542
01:40:56.951 --> 01:40:58.076
Tommy.

1543
01:40:58.243 --> 01:41:00.745
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1544
01:41:00.955 --> 01:41:03.706
You believe that?
This little guinea bastard.

1545
01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:09.045
He's gonna get made. We're gonna work
for this guy one day. He's gonna be a boss.

1546
01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:11.714
I can't believe it.

1547
01:41:11.882 --> 01:41:14.050
I'm really happy for you.
Great. Congratulations.

1548
01:41:14.218 --> 01:41:16.219
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1549
01:41:17.012 --> 01:41:21.265
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.
Can I talk to you a second?

1550
01:41:22.059 --> 01:41:24.394
I mastermind the goddamn thing,
I'm left with dick.

1551
01:41:24.561 --> 01:41:27.939
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him! I want my money.

1552
01:41:28.273 --> 01:41:30.400
I want my money! I've had it up to here!

1553
01:41:30.567 --> 01:41:32.902
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1554
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:35.863
- Fuck him! I want my money!
- Good. Go tell him.

1555
01:41:38.575 --> 01:41:42.453
You're gonna keep your mouth shut,
or what? Huh?

1556
01:41:43.038 --> 01:41:44.914
Morrie, you're gonna get your money.

1557
01:41:45.082 --> 01:41:47.542
You just got to stop busting balls.

1558
01:41:47.918 --> 01:41:50.753
All right? Look at me. You hear me?
Look at me, okay?

1559
01:41:50.963 --> 01:41:53.172
Everything's going to be fine.

1560
01:41:59.263 --> 01:42:00.304
Henry.

1561
01:42:05.936 --> 01:42:09.439
Sweetheart, half mick, half guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1562
01:42:51.815 --> 01:42:55.068
<i>I could see for the first time
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.</i>

1563
01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:58.404
<i>His mind was going in
eight different directions at once.</i>

1564
01:43:00.699 --> 01:43:03.159
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1565
01:43:03.452 --> 01:43:04.827
Morrie? Him?

1566
01:43:05.412 --> 01:43:08.289
<i>That's when I knew
Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.</i>

1567
01:43:08.457 --> 01:43:12.794
<i>That's how it happens. That's how fast
it takes for a guy to get whacked.</i>

1568
01:43:13.462 --> 01:43:15.838
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1569
01:43:16.006 --> 01:43:19.509
Acts like a jerk in his commercials.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1570
01:43:19.676 --> 01:43:22.845
Nobody fucking cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1571
01:43:23.055 --> 01:43:25.681
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1572
01:43:25.849 --> 01:43:27.475
- Okay?
- All right.

1573
01:43:29.895 --> 01:43:32.772
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

1574
01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.899
Stop breaking my balls, all right?

1575
01:43:35.067 --> 01:43:36.943
<i>I was just stalling for time.</i>

1576
01:43:37.694 --> 01:43:41.781
<i>I knew I still had till 8:00 or 9:00
to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.</i>

1577
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:46.035
<i>But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,
I was going along with the program.</i>

1578
01:43:46.203 --> 01:43:49.956
I pulled his hair out of his
fucking head. I bit him. He's out cold.

1579
01:43:52.042 --> 01:43:54.335
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1580
01:43:54.503 --> 01:43:57.421
I walk away.
We start to go in the fucking joint.

1581
01:43:57.798 --> 01:44:00.633
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.

1582
01:44:01.552 --> 01:44:03.344
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1583
01:44:03.512 --> 01:44:06.931
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says...

1584
01:44:07.099 --> 01:44:08.224
Ah... Ah...

1585
01:44:08.392 --> 01:44:10.226
I said, "Don't say it."

1586
01:44:12.062 --> 01:44:14.063
Ah... Ah... Ah...

1587
01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:16.482
"Jerkoff!"

1588
01:44:19.236 --> 01:44:22.738
What are you going to do? What?
I fucking fly at him.

1589
01:44:22.906 --> 01:44:25.908
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

1590
01:44:26.076 --> 01:44:27.785
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.

1591
01:44:27.953 --> 01:44:30.955
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1592
01:44:31.123 --> 01:44:34.083
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.

1593
01:44:34.251 --> 01:44:36.836
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1594
01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:39.714
<i>It was a load off my mind.</i>

1595
01:44:40.799 --> 01:44:42.008
<i>Poor bastard.</i>

1596
01:44:42.176 --> 01:44:44.427
<i>He never knew how close he'd come
to getting killed.</i>

1597
01:44:44.595 --> 01:44:47.513
<i>Even if I told him,
he would have never believed me.</i>

1598
01:44:49.266 --> 01:44:53.269
- Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
- You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1599
01:44:53.896 --> 01:44:57.106
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.
Let's get it over with.

1600
01:44:57.274 --> 01:45:00.276
I've never met a ball buster like you,
my whole life.

1601
01:45:00.444 --> 01:45:02.445
Who loves you more than I do?

1602
01:45:02.613 --> 01:45:05.948
- I'd do anything for you.
- Except to stop busting my balls.

1603
01:45:06.867 --> 01:45:09.285
- Let's go have coffee.
- Want to go to the diner?

1604
01:45:09.453 --> 01:45:11.704
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1605
01:45:12.414 --> 01:45:15.333
- Which diner?
- Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1606
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.627
- They got Danishes?
- They got everything.

1607
01:45:17.794 --> 01:45:20.087
Let's pick up some Danishes for Belle.

1608
01:45:20.631 --> 01:45:24.967
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio...

1609
01:45:33.143 --> 01:45:34.644
I thought he'd never shut up.

1610
01:45:34.811 --> 01:45:36.520
What a pain in the ass.

1611
01:45:36.688 --> 01:45:39.482
- What'll we do with him?
- Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1612
01:45:39.650 --> 01:45:41.609
Call me when you're through.

1613
01:45:41.777 --> 01:45:44.195
- Frank, let's chop him up.
- All right.

1614
01:45:44.363 --> 01:45:46.906
Where you going,
you dizzy motherfucker, you?

1615
01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:48.115
You said chop him up.

1616
01:45:48.283 --> 01:45:51.619
At Charlie's, not here!
Where are you gonna chop him here?

1617
01:45:52.621 --> 01:45:55.248
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1618
01:45:55.415 --> 01:45:57.500
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1619
01:45:57.668 --> 01:45:59.418
The car's cold.

1620
01:45:59.586 --> 01:46:03.172
Get the fuck out of here!
What, warm it up? Get out of here!

1621
01:46:04.007 --> 01:46:06.467
- Who is it?
- It's Belle. Open up.

1622
01:46:06.635 --> 01:46:08.344
It's Belle. Let me in.

1623
01:46:09.179 --> 01:46:13.015
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.

1624
01:46:13.183 --> 01:46:14.517
Calm down.

1625
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:17.228
He's missing! I know something happened.

1626
01:46:17.396 --> 01:46:19.605
He's probably drunk
and fell asleep somewhere.

1627
01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:23.442
In 27 years, he's never been away all night
without calling.

1628
01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:26.362
I know something's happened.
I know you know.

1629
01:46:26.530 --> 01:46:30.032
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home, then look for him.

1630
01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.451
I've been home! I've been on the phone...

1631
01:46:32.619 --> 01:46:33.869
He's playing cards.

1632
01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.542
- What'll I tell Belle?
- Who gives a fuck?

1633
01:46:40.419 --> 01:46:43.879
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

1634
01:46:44.047 --> 01:46:46.090
- Watch this.
- Don't fuck with them.

1635
01:46:46.258 --> 01:46:48.217
I do it all the time.
I'll bust their balls.

1636
01:46:48.385 --> 01:46:51.220
Don't give them the satisfaction,
the fucks.

1637
01:46:53.724 --> 01:46:55.766
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1638
01:46:57.352 --> 01:46:59.061
Keep them up all night.

1639
01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:01.564
I'll see you later.

1640
01:47:51.239 --> 01:47:54.408
<i>Jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery...</i>

1641
01:47:54.576 --> 01:47:56.952
<i>but it had nothing to do with me.</i>

1642
01:48:07.464 --> 01:48:10.800
<i>I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me
some Christmas money.</i>

1643
01:48:12.552 --> 01:48:14.929
<i>From then on, I kept my mouth shut.</i>

1644
01:48:15.097 --> 01:48:18.974
<i>I knew Jimmy.
He had the cash. It was his.</i>

1645
01:48:19.142 --> 01:48:22.478
<i>He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,
but that was it.</i>

1646
01:48:23.563 --> 01:48:27.024
<i>It made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it.</i>

1647
01:48:27.192 --> 01:48:30.027
<i>He'd rather whack them.
Anyway, what did I care?</i>

1648
01:48:30.195 --> 01:48:32.029
<i>I wasn't asking for anything.</i>

1649
01:48:32.197 --> 01:48:35.825
<i>And Jimmy was making nice money
through my Pittsburgh connections.</i>

1650
01:48:36.368 --> 01:48:40.454
<i>Still, months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over.</i>

1651
01:49:02.477 --> 01:49:05.187
<i>When they found Carbone
in the meat truck...</i>

1652
01:49:05.355 --> 01:49:07.022
<i>he was frozen so stiff...</i>

1653
01:49:07.190 --> 01:49:10.317
<i>it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy.</i>

1654
01:49:15.157 --> 01:49:17.283
<i>Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.</i>

1655
01:49:17.701 --> 01:49:21.287
<i>He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through my Pittsburgh people...</i>

1656
01:49:21.455 --> 01:49:24.999
<i>and even after a while,
the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.</i>

1657
01:49:25.167 --> 01:49:27.334
<i>What made Jimmy so happy
that morning...</i>

1658
01:49:27.502 --> 01:49:30.379
<i>was that this was the day
that Tommy was being made.</i>

1659
01:49:30.881 --> 01:49:33.883
<i>Jimmy was so excited,
you'd think he was being made.</i>

1660
01:49:34.509 --> 01:49:37.136
<i>He must have made four calls
to Tommy's house.</i>

1661
01:49:37.345 --> 01:49:41.265
<i>They had a signal set up, so he'd know
the minute the ceremony was over.</i>

1662
01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:44.393
- Ma, where are you?
- Here I am.

1663
01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:47.563
- You're home.
- Home? I'm leaving.

1664
01:49:48.023 --> 01:49:50.566
- You look lovely.
- I look good, huh?

1665
01:49:50.734 --> 01:49:54.111
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

1666
01:49:54.779 --> 01:49:58.115
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

1667
01:49:58.283 --> 01:49:59.909
- God be with you.
- Bye, Ma.

1668
01:50:00.076 --> 01:50:02.411
<i>We always called each other goodfellas.</i>

1669
01:50:02.579 --> 01:50:04.205
<i>You'd say to somebody:</i>

1670
01:50:04.372 --> 01:50:08.584
<i>"You'll like this guy. He's all right.
He's a goodfella, one of us."</i>

1671
01:50:08.919 --> 01:50:10.294
<i>You understand?</i>

1672
01:50:10.962 --> 01:50:13.297
<i>We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.</i>

1673
01:50:15.759 --> 01:50:19.136
<i>But Jimmy and I could never be made
because we had Irish blood.</i>

1674
01:50:19.304 --> 01:50:21.764
<i>It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.</i>

1675
01:50:22.015 --> 01:50:25.935
<i>To become a member of a crew,
you've got to be 100% Italian...</i>

1676
01:50:26.102 --> 01:50:29.313
<i>so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country.</i>

1677
01:50:36.446 --> 01:50:38.781
<i>It's the highest honor they can give you.</i>

1678
01:50:38.949 --> 01:50:41.450
<i>It means you belong
to a family and a crew.</i>

1679
01:50:41.826 --> 01:50:44.370
<i>It means nobody can fuck around
with you.</i>

1680
01:50:44.913 --> 01:50:47.289
<i>It also means you could
fuck around with anybody...</i>

1681
01:50:47.457 --> 01:50:49.917
<i>just as long as they aren't also a member.</i>

1682
01:50:50.085 --> 01:50:53.504
<i>It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.</i>

1683
01:50:55.674 --> 01:50:57.675
How many years ago
since you were made?

1684
01:50:57.842 --> 01:51:00.594
- I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago.
- Thirty years?

1685
01:51:00.762 --> 01:51:05.015
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1686
01:51:08.311 --> 01:51:11.272
<i>As far as Jimmy was concerned,
with Tommy being made...</i>

1687
01:51:11.439 --> 01:51:13.816
<i>it was like we were all being made.</i>

1688
01:51:14.693 --> 01:51:17.236
<i>We would now have
one of our own as a member.</i>

1689
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:29.999
Oh, no...

1690
01:51:33.003 --> 01:51:34.837
- Who's this?
- This is Vinnie.

1691
01:51:35.005 --> 01:51:37.840
Vinnie. What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1692
01:51:38.008 --> 01:51:41.010
<i>No, we had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.</i>

1693
01:51:41.177 --> 01:51:42.177
What do you mean?

1694
01:51:42.345 --> 01:51:46.515
<i>You know what I mean. He's gone,
and we couldn't do nothing about it.</i>

1695
01:51:48.393 --> 01:51:50.269
<i>- That's it.</i>
- What do you mean?

1696
01:51:50.437 --> 01:51:51.812
<i>He's gone.</i>

1697
01:51:53.773 --> 01:51:54.815
<i>That's it.</i>

1698
01:51:59.696 --> 01:52:02.531
I knew it! I can't fucking believe it.

1699
01:52:12.917 --> 01:52:15.044
- What happened?
- They fucking whacked him.

1700
01:52:15.211 --> 01:52:16.378
Fuck.

1701
01:52:32.228 --> 01:52:33.896
Are you all right?

1702
01:52:40.945 --> 01:52:43.447
<i>It was revenge for Billy Batts...</i>

1703
01:52:43.615 --> 01:52:45.407
<i>and a lot of other things.</i>

1704
01:52:45.575 --> 01:52:46.575
And that's that.

1705
01:52:46.743 --> 01:52:49.244
<i>There was nothing we could do about it.</i>

1706
01:52:49.412 --> 01:52:52.039
<i>Batts was a made man
and Tommy wasn't.</i>

1707
01:52:52.624 --> 01:52:54.583
<i>We had to sit still and take it.</i>

1708
01:52:54.751 --> 01:52:58.170
<i>It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.</i>

1709
01:53:10.809 --> 01:53:12.643
<i>They even shot Tommy in the face...</i>

1710
01:53:12.811 --> 01:53:16.271
<i>so his mother couldn't give him
an open coffin at the funeral.</i>

1711
01:54:03.778 --> 01:54:07.072
<i>I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's...</i>

1712
01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:08.991
<i>to match some silencers he had.</i>

1713
01:54:09.159 --> 01:54:12.161
<i>I had to pick up my brother at the hospital
and drive him home.</i>

1714
01:54:12.328 --> 01:54:14.830
<i>I had to pick up
some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois...</i>

1715
01:54:14.998 --> 01:54:18.167
<i>to fly down to some customers
I had near Atlanta.</i>

1716
01:54:29.471 --> 01:54:32.931
<i>Right away, I knew he didn't want them,
and I'd be stuck for the money.</i>

1717
01:54:33.099 --> 01:54:36.810
<i>I only bought them because
he wanted them, and now he didn't.</i>

1718
01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:41.023
What good are these? None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?

1719
01:54:41.191 --> 01:54:42.524
I'm not paying for it.

1720
01:54:42.692 --> 01:54:46.361
<i>I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was
so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye.</i>

1721
01:54:46.529 --> 01:54:48.697
Stop the drugs. They're making
your mind into mush!

1722
01:54:48.865 --> 01:54:50.305
- You hear me?
- I'll take them back.

1723
01:55:03.922 --> 01:55:05.881
<i>My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.</i>

1724
01:55:06.049 --> 01:55:09.635
<i>Since I would see them in the afternoon
to pick up a delivery...</i>

1725
01:55:09.803 --> 01:55:12.387
<i>I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.</i>

1726
01:55:31.407 --> 01:55:32.407
Oh, my God.

1727
01:55:34.244 --> 01:55:38.288
{\an8}<i>When I finally got to the hospital,
Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.</i>

1728
01:55:38.456 --> 01:55:40.582
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

1729
01:55:41.626 --> 01:55:44.002
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.

1730
01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:47.089
<i>And I told him I was partying all night.</i>

1731
01:55:47.257 --> 01:55:49.049
- I'm fine.
- Come on. Get over here.

1732
01:55:49.217 --> 01:55:51.301
- Doc, I'm fine.
- Let me check you out.

1733
01:55:51.803 --> 01:55:52.970
Come on.

1734
01:55:56.015 --> 01:55:58.684
<i>He took mercy on me,
gave me 10 milligrams of Valium...</i>

1735
01:55:58.852 --> 01:55:59.935
<i>and sent me home.</i>

1736
01:56:00.645 --> 01:56:04.398
<i>My plan was to drop off my brother
at the house and pick up Karen.</i>

1737
01:56:06.442 --> 01:56:09.653
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

1738
01:56:09.821 --> 01:56:13.156
Right in front of us, there.
I think it's been following me all morning.

1739
01:56:13.324 --> 01:56:16.159
- Get the fuck out. What are you, nuts?
- I'm telling you.

1740
01:56:16.327 --> 01:56:17.536
I don't know what's going on.

1741
01:56:17.704 --> 01:56:20.747
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.

1742
01:56:20.915 --> 01:56:23.292
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.

1743
01:56:23.459 --> 01:56:25.878
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

1744
01:56:32.844 --> 01:56:34.469
{\an8}<i>I was cooking dinner that night.</i>

1745
01:56:35.597 --> 01:56:39.266
{\an8}<i>I had to start braising the beef
and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.</i>

1746
01:56:41.936 --> 01:56:45.147
<i>It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with meat gravy...</i>

1747
01:56:45.315 --> 01:56:47.816
<i>and I'm planning to roast some peppers
over the flames...</i>

1748
01:56:47.984 --> 01:56:51.945
<i>put on some string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets...</i>

1749
01:56:52.113 --> 01:56:53.193
<i>that were cut just right...</i>

1750
01:56:53.323 --> 01:56:56.325
<i>that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.</i>

1751
01:56:56.534 --> 01:56:58.493
<i>So, I was home for about an hour.</i>

1752
01:56:58.703 --> 01:57:00.662
<i>My plan was to start the dinner early...</i>

1753
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:03.373
<i>so Karen and I could unload the guns
Jimmy didn't want...</i>

1754
01:57:03.541 --> 01:57:04.958
<i>then get the package for Lois...</i>

1755
01:57:05.126 --> 01:57:07.669
<i>to take to Atlanta for her trip
later that night.</i>

1756
01:57:08.546 --> 01:57:12.341
<i>I kept looking out the window,
and I saw that the helicopter was gone.</i>

1757
01:57:12.967 --> 01:57:16.470
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1758
01:57:17.597 --> 01:57:21.350
<i>So I asked my brother to watch the sauce,
and Karen and I started out.</i>

1759
01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:26.355
Oh, God. I see it.

1760
01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:29.107
- I see it. Look, it's right there.
- Damn!

1761
01:57:30.318 --> 01:57:31.735
- That's it.
- There it is.

1762
01:57:31.903 --> 01:57:33.528
We got to get to your mother's.

1763
01:57:34.155 --> 01:57:35.405
See, I told you.

1764
01:57:35.615 --> 01:57:36.990
It's funny.

1765
01:57:37.367 --> 01:57:40.369
- It's not the end of the world.
- We're going to your mother's.

1766
01:58:08.898 --> 01:58:12.609
Go inside, tell your mother not to touch
anything outside the house. Nothing.

1767
01:58:12.777 --> 01:58:15.529
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.

1768
01:58:21.077 --> 01:58:22.744
Let's go shopping.

1769
01:58:24.998 --> 01:58:27.124
{\an8}I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all morning.

1770
01:58:28.292 --> 01:58:29.418
{\an8}I'm telling you.

1771
01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:33.672
Fine. Fine. He thinks I'm paranoid!

1772
01:58:34.757 --> 01:58:38.135
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1773
01:58:40.138 --> 01:58:42.014
Come on, let's go inside.

1774
01:58:46.102 --> 01:58:48.061
- Yeah, it's gone.
- I don't hear anything.

1775
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:49.521
Let's go back to your mother's.

1776
01:59:03.411 --> 01:59:05.954
- They all right?
- Beautiful. They're great.

1777
01:59:06.789 --> 01:59:09.458
Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

1778
01:59:09.625 --> 01:59:11.126
Yeah. I need a hit.

1779
01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:14.713
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1780
01:59:14.881 --> 01:59:17.799
I've seen enough helicopters for one day,
thank you.

1781
01:59:18.843 --> 01:59:23.180
<i>I had to get home and get the
package ready for Lois to take on her trip.</i>

1782
01:59:23.347 --> 01:59:26.147
<i>Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give
the package a whack with quinine.</i>

1783
01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:29.811
<i>Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.</i>

1784
01:59:29.979 --> 01:59:33.690
<i>I had the cooking to finish,
and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.</i>

1785
01:59:33.858 --> 01:59:36.401
- It's Sandy. What is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.

1786
01:59:37.111 --> 01:59:38.779
<i>When are you coming over?</i>

1787
01:59:38.946 --> 01:59:40.822
- In an hour.
<i>- You staying tonight, right?</i>

1788
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:42.991
I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1789
01:59:43.326 --> 01:59:47.412
Come on, stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Goodbye.

1790
01:59:55.046 --> 01:59:57.047
- Hello?
- It's me. You ready?

1791
01:59:58.049 --> 02:00:00.884
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
Keep stirring it.

1792
02:00:01.469 --> 02:00:05.305
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.

1793
02:00:05.473 --> 02:00:07.307
<i>- Listen, you know what to do?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

1794
02:00:07.475 --> 02:00:09.684
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois.
This is important.

1795
02:00:09.852 --> 02:00:12.312
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

1796
02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:15.649
Understand me?
Call from an outside line. I mean it.

1797
02:00:15.817 --> 02:00:19.486
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb. Why
are you bugging me? I know what to do.

1798
02:00:19.654 --> 02:00:22.197
You little hick, just make sure you do it.

1799
02:00:22.365 --> 02:00:23.406
<i>You can be such a pain.</i>

1800
02:00:23.574 --> 02:00:27.702
<i>- Hey! Just do it!</i>
- Okay.

1801
02:00:28.287 --> 02:00:32.833
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1802
02:00:34.168 --> 02:00:36.294
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

1803
02:00:36.462 --> 02:00:38.755
<i>What does she do
after she hangs up with me?</i>

1804
02:00:38.923 --> 02:00:42.425
<i>After everything I told her?
After all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit?</i>

1805
02:00:42.593 --> 02:00:45.220
<i>She picks up the phone
and calls from the house.</i>

1806
02:00:45.388 --> 02:00:47.722
<i>If anybody was listening,
they'd know everything.</i>

1807
02:00:47.890 --> 02:00:49.808
<i>They'd know a package
was leaving my house...</i>

1808
02:00:49.976 --> 02:00:53.228
<i>and they'd even have the time and
flight number, thanks to her.</i>

1809
02:00:54.397 --> 02:00:57.065
{\an8}<i>As soon as I got home, I started cooking.</i>

1810
02:00:57.233 --> 02:00:59.317
<i>I had a few hours until Lois' flight.</i>

1811
02:00:59.485 --> 02:01:01.570
<i>I told my brother to watch the stove.</i>

1812
02:01:01.737 --> 02:01:04.865
<i>All day long the guy's been watching
helicopters and tomato sauce.</i>

1813
02:01:06.325 --> 02:01:10.954
<i>I had to drive over to Sandy's,
mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.</i>

1814
02:01:22.133 --> 02:01:24.968
Do you think you can come over here,
fuck me, and leave?

1815
02:01:25.344 --> 02:01:27.429
- Come on.
- You got someplace better to go?

1816
02:01:27.597 --> 02:01:30.098
Don't talk like that. Come on.

1817
02:01:30.433 --> 02:01:32.267
- You all right?
- Yeah, sure.

1818
02:01:32.435 --> 02:01:33.435
You believe me?

1819
02:01:34.854 --> 02:01:37.647
Do you believe me?

1820
02:01:39.984 --> 02:01:41.484
- That the last one?
- Yeah.

1821
02:01:51.329 --> 02:01:53.288
You lying son of a bitch. I hate you!

1822
02:02:00.379 --> 02:02:04.174
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...

1823
02:02:04.342 --> 02:02:06.635
from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1824
02:02:06.802 --> 02:02:09.137
- I have to.
- You don't have to.

1825
02:02:14.101 --> 02:02:15.560
I got to go home.

1826
02:02:17.605 --> 02:02:19.522
What do you mean, you got to go home?

1827
02:02:19.690 --> 02:02:20.982
I've been carrying this all day.

1828
02:02:21.150 --> 02:02:23.777
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1829
02:02:23.945 --> 02:02:25.862
I got to go home and get my hat.

1830
02:02:26.781 --> 02:02:28.990
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?

1831
02:02:29.575 --> 02:02:32.327
So I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

1832
02:02:32.495 --> 02:02:36.373
I need it, I got to have it.
It's my lucky hat. I never fly without it.

1833
02:02:36.666 --> 02:02:40.669
Lois, do you understand
what we are involved in here?

1834
02:02:41.128 --> 02:02:44.172
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

1835
02:02:49.095 --> 02:02:52.889
<i>What could I do if she insisted
I drive her home for her goddamn hat?</i>

1836
02:02:53.057 --> 02:02:55.642
<i>I hid the package in the kitchen
and went to take her home.</i>

1837
02:02:55.810 --> 02:02:56.810
A hat?

1838
02:03:05.945 --> 02:03:07.320
What the fuck is this?

1839
02:03:07.738 --> 02:03:10.282
Police! Freeze! Don't you move,
you motherfucker...

1840
02:03:10.449 --> 02:03:13.493
or I'll blow your brains out.
Shut the car off slowly.

1841
02:03:17.498 --> 02:03:19.666
<i>For a second, I thought I was dead.</i>

1842
02:03:19.834 --> 02:03:22.168
<i>But when I heard all the noise,
I knew they were cops.</i>

1843
02:03:22.336 --> 02:03:23.878
<i>Only cops talk that way.</i>

1844
02:03:24.213 --> 02:03:25.380
Don't fucking move.

1845
02:03:25.548 --> 02:03:29.050
<i>If they had been wiseguys,
I wouldn't have heard a thing.</i>

1846
02:03:29.927 --> 02:03:31.553
<i>I would have been dead.</i>

1847
02:03:32.555 --> 02:03:34.014
Michael, lock the door!

1848
02:03:58.539 --> 02:04:01.207
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar?

1849
02:04:01.625 --> 02:04:03.251
Fuckhead, I'm talking to you.

1850
02:04:03.419 --> 02:04:07.088
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't really give a fuck.

1851
02:04:07.256 --> 02:04:11.343
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

1852
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:13.595
<i>All day I thought the guys
in the helicopter...</i>

1853
02:04:13.763 --> 02:04:18.308
<i>were local cops busting my balls over
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.</i>

1854
02:04:18.476 --> 02:04:19.476
Just get the lawyer.

1855
02:04:19.643 --> 02:04:23.229
<i>They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance, everything.</i>

1856
02:04:23.397 --> 02:04:26.066
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1857
02:04:26.233 --> 02:04:29.152
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a problem all night.

1858
02:04:29.987 --> 02:04:33.865
Each one of these counts holds
25-to-life in New York State.

1859
02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:38.620
Twenty-five fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1860
02:04:39.372 --> 02:04:41.623
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1861
02:04:43.042 --> 02:04:46.878
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1862
02:04:47.129 --> 02:04:49.297
You got anything good in there?

1863
02:04:51.008 --> 02:04:52.050
Is it good?

1864
02:04:57.139 --> 02:04:58.723
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1865
02:05:01.852 --> 02:05:03.311
See you in Attica, dick.

1866
02:05:03.896 --> 02:05:07.107
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1867
02:05:07.650 --> 02:05:10.902
He just wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

1868
02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:12.487
Fuck Jimmy and his money.

1869
02:05:12.655 --> 02:05:15.865
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1870
02:05:16.784 --> 02:05:18.410
Then you're better off staying in here.

1871
02:05:18.577 --> 02:05:22.163
They could whack me in here as easy
as outside, maybe even easier.

1872
02:05:22.331 --> 02:05:23.957
They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1873
02:05:24.125 --> 02:05:27.961
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1874
02:05:28.546 --> 02:05:33.174
<i>Karen finally got her mother to put
her house up for my bail and I was out.</i>

1875
02:05:33.342 --> 02:05:37.429
<i>I remember I had this feeling
I would be killed right outside the jail.</i>

1876
02:05:37.847 --> 02:05:41.015
<i>I knew Paulie was still pissed at me,
and he's such a hothead.</i>

1877
02:05:41.183 --> 02:05:42.934
<i>And I was worried about Jimmy.</i>

1878
02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:47.397
<i>See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out
he was into drug deals with me...</i>

1879
02:05:48.107 --> 02:05:51.151
<i>Paulie would have Jimmy whacked
even before me.</i>

1880
02:05:52.862 --> 02:05:54.487
<i>This is the bad time.</i>

1881
02:05:55.364 --> 02:05:57.615
<i>I didn't feel safe until I got home.</i>

1882
02:05:59.452 --> 02:06:03.204
<i>Now my plan was to stay alive
long enough to sell off the dope...</i>

1883
02:06:03.372 --> 02:06:07.959
<i>the cops never found, then disappear
until I can get things straightened out.</i>

1884
02:06:09.587 --> 02:06:10.587
Fuck!

1885
02:06:10.754 --> 02:06:14.507
- Where's the stuff I left, Karen?
- I flushed it down the toilet.

1886
02:06:16.218 --> 02:06:17.260
You what?

1887
02:06:17.887 --> 02:06:20.388
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.

1888
02:06:20.556 --> 02:06:24.642
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!

1889
02:06:24.810 --> 02:06:27.479
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!

1890
02:06:27.646 --> 02:06:32.066
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1891
02:06:32.610 --> 02:06:35.403
I had to. They were going to find it!

1892
02:06:35.571 --> 02:06:39.574
- They would have never found it!
- They would have, I swear to you!

1893
02:06:40.993 --> 02:06:42.660
They would've found it!

1894
02:06:44.079 --> 02:06:45.538
Why did you do that?

1895
02:06:45.706 --> 02:06:49.250
- They would have found it.
- Why did you do that, Karen?

1896
02:06:50.503 --> 02:06:52.420
Oh, my God!

1897
02:06:52.922 --> 02:06:55.840
- I had to do it.
- Oh, my God.

1898
02:07:31.961 --> 02:07:33.920
<i>Paulie, I'm really sorry.</i>

1899
02:07:36.590 --> 02:07:39.342
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

1900
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:41.177
Yeah, you fucked up.

1901
02:07:44.848 --> 02:07:46.766
But I'm all right now.

1902
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:52.689
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

1903
02:07:52.856 --> 02:07:55.066
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1904
02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:58.486
You treated me like a fucking jerk.

1905
02:07:59.113 --> 02:08:00.613
Like I was never nothing to you.

1906
02:08:00.781 --> 02:08:03.658
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

1907
02:08:04.785 --> 02:08:07.161
You know, I was ashamed.

1908
02:08:10.165 --> 02:08:12.166
I'm ashamed now.

1909
02:08:15.504 --> 02:08:17.672
But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie.

1910
02:08:20.884 --> 02:08:25.179
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help. I really do.

1911
02:08:31.395 --> 02:08:32.478
Take this.

1912
02:08:47.536 --> 02:08:49.662
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1913
02:09:00.049 --> 02:09:01.716
<i>$3,200.</i>

1914
02:09:02.301 --> 02:09:06.304
<i>That's what he gave me.
$3,200 for a lifetime.</i>

1915
02:09:07.222 --> 02:09:09.432
<i>It wasn't even enough
to pay for the coffin.</i>

1916
02:09:09.642 --> 02:09:11.726
- We got to get out.
- I don't want to run.

1917
02:09:11.894 --> 02:09:16.230
I don't want to. Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1918
02:09:16.649 --> 02:09:19.150
I don't want to do that.
Is that what you want?

1919
02:09:19.318 --> 02:09:21.486
If we stay around here, we're dead.

1920
02:09:22.237 --> 02:09:24.072
You got it? We're dead.

1921
02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:25.740
They're right.

1922
02:09:26.325 --> 02:09:29.285
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.

1923
02:09:32.873 --> 02:09:34.707
How's he doing? Busting his balls or what?

1924
02:09:34.875 --> 02:09:35.875
He's okay.

1925
02:09:37.086 --> 02:09:38.336
They sobered him up.

1926
02:09:38.837 --> 02:09:40.713
Good. Very good. Glad to hear it.

1927
02:09:44.927 --> 02:09:47.220
You know what kind of questions
they're asking him?

1928
02:09:47.388 --> 02:09:48.971
Jimmy, I don't know.

1929
02:09:50.057 --> 02:09:53.601
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...

1930
02:09:54.144 --> 02:09:56.771
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

1931
02:09:56.939 --> 02:09:58.940
Tell him he's got to call me. Okay?

1932
02:09:59.817 --> 02:10:03.444
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.

1933
02:10:03.779 --> 02:10:07.407
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

1934
02:10:07.574 --> 02:10:10.618
- Take this. It's a couple of thousands.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

1935
02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:12.787
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1936
02:10:12.955 --> 02:10:16.290
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

1937
02:10:16.542 --> 02:10:18.418
Pick out a few for yourself.

1938
02:10:19.211 --> 02:10:20.878
- For my mom.
- Yeah, whatever.

1939
02:10:21.296 --> 02:10:23.965
No. It's over here.
In the store on the corner.

1940
02:10:24.133 --> 02:10:26.551
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1941
02:10:32.516 --> 02:10:34.016
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1942
02:10:34.476 --> 02:10:36.185
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Don't worry.

1943
02:10:36.395 --> 02:10:38.980
- I'll try.
- Don't forget, he's got to call me.

1944
02:10:41.608 --> 02:10:43.818
- Over here?
- Right down there.

1945
02:10:58.834 --> 02:11:00.501
It's over there, on the corner.

1946
02:11:01.170 --> 02:11:02.462
Right there.

1947
02:11:24.526 --> 02:11:26.110
Shh, shh, shh.

1948
02:11:36.663 --> 02:11:38.790
No, go ahead. It's right in there.

1949
02:11:38.957 --> 02:11:41.042
No, Jimmy. I'm in a hurry!

1950
02:11:41.376 --> 02:11:44.212
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

1951
02:11:44.379 --> 02:11:45.880
I'll come back later!

1952
02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:09.946
Karen. Karen!

1953
02:12:14.451 --> 02:12:15.701
What happened?

1954
02:12:16.912 --> 02:12:18.371
Nothing.

1955
02:12:18.539 --> 02:12:20.414
- What happened?
- I just got scared.

1956
02:12:23.919 --> 02:12:25.086
Got the keys?

1957
02:12:26.839 --> 02:12:30.466
- What happened, Karen?
- I just got scared. It's okay.

1958
02:12:30.634 --> 02:12:32.260
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1959
02:12:39.142 --> 02:12:43.729
<i>If you're part of a crew, nobody
ever tells you they're going to kill you.</i>

1960
02:12:44.273 --> 02:12:46.023
<i>It doesn't happen that way.</i>

1961
02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:49.610
<i>There aren't any arguments
or curses like in the movies.</i>

1962
02:12:49.778 --> 02:12:53.865
<i>Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.</i>

1963
02:12:54.032 --> 02:12:56.075
<i>People who cared for you all your life.</i>

1964
02:12:56.243 --> 02:13:00.621
<i>They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.</i>

1965
02:13:00.956 --> 02:13:04.208
<i>So I met Jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew.</i>

1966
02:13:04.585 --> 02:13:08.588
<i>I got there 15 minutes early,
and Jimmy was already there.</i>

1967
02:13:09.006 --> 02:13:13.426
<i>He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.</i>

1968
02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:16.137
<i>He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.</i>

1969
02:13:16.555 --> 02:13:19.432
<i>He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.</i>

1970
02:13:20.475 --> 02:13:23.477
<i>On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.</i>

1971
02:13:23.645 --> 02:13:25.980
<i>We were supposed to be discussing
my case.</i>

1972
02:13:26.148 --> 02:13:31.110
<i>But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.</i>

1973
02:13:32.779 --> 02:13:36.490
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

1974
02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:38.492
Now you understand?

1975
02:13:41.163 --> 02:13:44.498
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.

1976
02:13:47.669 --> 02:13:51.923
You know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

1977
02:13:54.343 --> 02:13:58.554
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as
he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1978
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:03.267
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

1979
02:14:05.187 --> 02:14:06.520
Know what I'm saying?

1980
02:14:11.526 --> 02:14:14.695
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1981
02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:16.864
Mm-mm.

1982
02:14:17.783 --> 02:14:19.033
No, not at all.

1983
02:14:20.661 --> 02:14:22.244
That way they got nothing.

1984
02:14:31.088 --> 02:14:33.839
<i>Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.</i>

1985
02:14:34.299 --> 02:14:37.969
<i>But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.</i>

1986
02:14:45.519 --> 02:14:48.854
<i>That's when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.</i>

1987
02:15:03.245 --> 02:15:06.539
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

1988
02:15:06.707 --> 02:15:08.541
I don't want to go any place cold.

1989
02:15:09.543 --> 02:15:11.711
You don't have a choice in that matter.

1990
02:15:12.087 --> 02:15:14.630
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1991
02:15:15.424 --> 02:15:18.092
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to...

1992
02:15:18.260 --> 02:15:19.969
He's bronchial, that's why.

1993
02:15:20.137 --> 02:15:22.722
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

1994
02:15:22.889 --> 02:15:25.099
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1995
02:15:25.267 --> 02:15:28.978
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1996
02:15:30.105 --> 02:15:31.105
What about them?

1997
02:15:31.273 --> 02:15:33.733
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

1998
02:15:34.985 --> 02:15:37.403
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

1999
02:15:38.071 --> 02:15:39.113
No.

2000
02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:43.576
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that...

2001
02:15:43.952 --> 02:15:47.955
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

2002
02:15:48.123 --> 02:15:51.125
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick...

2003
02:15:51.626 --> 02:15:53.794
if there's extraordinary circumstances...

2004
02:15:53.962 --> 02:15:56.797
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

2005
02:15:57.924 --> 02:15:59.675
I can't leave my parents.

2006
02:16:00.927 --> 02:16:03.137
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

2007
02:16:04.389 --> 02:16:07.391
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

2008
02:16:09.728 --> 02:16:11.395
I can't do it without you.

2009
02:16:11.813 --> 02:16:15.900
So, you do whatever, but... that's it.

2010
02:16:17.444 --> 02:16:19.987
- You need Henry, not me, right?
- That's right.

2011
02:16:20.322 --> 02:16:22.782
Frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

2012
02:16:23.116 --> 02:16:26.410
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

2013
02:16:26.578 --> 02:16:28.245
They want Henry, not me.

2014
02:16:28.413 --> 02:16:31.499
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

2015
02:16:32.417 --> 02:16:35.836
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

2016
02:16:36.004 --> 02:16:38.422
If he goes into the program,
you're in danger...

2017
02:16:38.590 --> 02:16:41.008
- I don't know anything.
- Don't give me...

2018
02:16:41.176 --> 02:16:42.551
the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2019
02:16:42.719 --> 02:16:47.306
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2020
02:16:47.474 --> 02:16:50.684
<i>Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.</i>

2021
02:16:55.941 --> 02:16:57.983
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

2022
02:16:58.151 --> 02:17:01.445
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

2023
02:17:02.197 --> 02:17:03.906
He knows it and you know it.

2024
02:17:05.534 --> 02:17:07.243
What about the kids and school?

2025
02:17:07.410 --> 02:17:09.703
<i>Will they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?</i>

2026
02:17:10.038 --> 02:17:12.456
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2027
02:17:12.624 --> 02:17:15.084
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2028
02:17:15.293 --> 02:17:18.337
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2029
02:17:19.172 --> 02:17:22.591
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2030
02:17:26.847 --> 02:17:29.473
<i>This morning you told the jury
about your background.</i>

2031
02:17:29.641 --> 02:17:31.475
<i>It was easy for us to disappear.</i>

2032
02:17:32.018 --> 02:17:34.145
<i>My house
was in my mother-in-law's name.</i>

2033
02:17:34.312 --> 02:17:36.272
<i>My cars were registered to my wife.</i>

2034
02:17:36.439 --> 02:17:39.900
<i>My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.</i>

2035
02:17:40.068 --> 02:17:42.403
<i>I never voted or paid taxes.</i>

2036
02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:47.449
<i>My birth certificate and arrest sheet was
all you'd ever have to know I was alive.</i>

2037
02:17:47.617 --> 02:17:49.577
Do you see him here in this courtroom?

2038
02:17:49.744 --> 02:17:50.744
Yes.

2039
02:17:50.912 --> 02:17:52.997
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2040
02:17:55.584 --> 02:18:00.212
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2041
02:18:01.339 --> 02:18:04.425
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2042
02:18:04.759 --> 02:18:06.760
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.

2043
02:18:07.345 --> 02:18:09.263
Can you point him out for the jury?

2044
02:18:11.224 --> 02:18:15.352
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2045
02:18:16.646 --> 02:18:18.355
Your Honor, I have a document...

2046
02:18:18.523 --> 02:18:20.941
<i>The hardest thing was leaving the life.</i>

2047
02:18:21.693 --> 02:18:23.235
<i>I still love the life.</i>

2048
02:18:23.612 --> 02:18:25.529
<i>We were treated like movie stars
with muscle.</i>

2049
02:18:25.697 --> 02:18:27.948
<i>We had it all, just for the asking.</i>

2050
02:18:28.116 --> 02:18:31.452
<i>Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.</i>

2051
02:18:31.786 --> 02:18:34.955
<i>I had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.</i>

2052
02:18:35.123 --> 02:18:37.374
<i>I had a sugar bowl full of coke
next to the bed.</i>

2053
02:18:37.542 --> 02:18:41.337
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2054
02:18:41.504 --> 02:18:43.547
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.

2055
02:18:43.715 --> 02:18:46.800
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about it.

2056
02:18:47.802 --> 02:18:49.488
Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence...

2057
02:18:49.512 --> 02:18:51.639
<i>Anything I wanted was a phone call away.</i>

2058
02:18:51.806 --> 02:18:55.226
<i>Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats
all over the city.</i>

2059
02:18:55.393 --> 02:18:57.895
<i>I'd bet $20,000, $30,000
over a weekend...</i>

2060
02:18:58.063 --> 02:19:02.233
<i>then blow the winnings in a week
or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.</i>

2061
02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:03.609
It didn't matter.

2062
02:19:04.152 --> 02:19:09.031
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

2063
02:19:09.449 --> 02:19:10.824
We ran everything.

2064
02:19:11.368 --> 02:19:15.663
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2065
02:19:15.914 --> 02:19:19.333
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2066
02:19:21.461 --> 02:19:22.962
And now it's all over.

2067
02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:25.339
<i>That's the hardest part.</i>

2068
02:19:26.341 --> 02:19:27.967
<i>Today everything is different.</i>

2069
02:19:28.134 --> 02:19:32.304
<i>There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.</i>

2070
02:19:32.681 --> 02:19:34.473
<i>Can't even get decent food.</i>

2071
02:19:35.225 --> 02:19:38.352
<i>After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...</i>

2072
02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:40.354
<i>and I got egg noodles and ketchup.</i>

2073
02:19:41.189 --> 02:19:42.690
<i>I'm an average nobody.</i>

2074
02:19:44.067 --> 02:19:46.860
<i>I get to live the rest of my life
like a schnook.</i>

2075
02:25:11.286 --> 02:25:13.287
English
