They say it takes a village

we are a village.

Sorry. How's Esmeralda doing?

In Lisa's research, she found

that if you talk
to your pumpkins

85
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:29.876

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.136
Yeah.

181
00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:18.971
[girl] Fire bad!

182
00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.306
Ha-ha!

183
00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:21.541
-Whoa!
-Wow.

184
00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.209
Talk about a big dummy.

185
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.945
Thanks. Franken-coconuts
is the official M.C.

186
00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:29.048
for the Spooktacular...
Monster of Ceremonies.

187
00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.818
Oh, Lincoln, can you please
give me the status

188
00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.619
of your super-secret
surprise finale?

189
00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:34.954
No can do.

190
00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.856
Doing a dry run
of our trick-or-treating route.

191
00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.858
We want to ensure
maximum efficiency.

192
00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:43.396
No! "Durblish Point Sent" means
"dentist appointment"!

193
00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:46.732
We're late for the dentist.
Let's go! Everybody in Vanzilla!

194
00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:48.000
[dramatic music]

195
00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:49.435
Go!

196
00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.270
[tires squeal]

197
00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:56.042
Ahh.

198
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:00.379
Ahh.

199
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.317
[both] Ahh.

200
00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:07.053
[hissing]

201
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.690
Ahh.

202
00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:12.124
[camera shutter clicks]

203
00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.493
Ahh.

204
00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.729
Ahh.

205
00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:19.765
Ahh.

206
00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:22.902
[rock music]

207
00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:27.974
Okay. So, we're gonna give you
some Novocaine.

208
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.909
No, thanks.
I only like lemon-y things

209
00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:31.711
-that don't hurt.
-It'll only hurt a little.

210
00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.846
Barbara, syringe and light,
please.

211
00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:35.514
-Got it.
-[all shout]

212
00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:38.050
-That looks like it hurt a lot.
-Why did you do that?

213
00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:39.585
Oh, you forgot the light.

214
00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:40.753
-Oh!
-[dentist groans]

215
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.322
No, that looks like
it hurt a lot.

216
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:45.091
[curious music]

217
00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:47.126
The good news is,

218
00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.129
I completed my dental degree
last spring break for funsies.

219
00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.665
The bad news is,
everyone in this room

220
00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.100
is riddled with cavities.

221
00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.701
Present company included.

222
00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.069
Even me?

223
00:08:57.637 --> 00:09:00.006
-Especially you, Lily.
-Whoops.

224
00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:01.440
Well, there must
be some mistake.

225
00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:04.210
I'm always on you kids
to take care of your teeth.

226
00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:06.078
[Lincoln] Yeah,
well, about that...

227
00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:07.880
Don't forget to floss!

228
00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:09.548
[all] Okay!

229
00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:10.750
Hmm.

230
00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:12.852
[comical music]

231
00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:14.353
This is all my fault.

232
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.189
I've been feeding
you kids candy nonstop.

233
00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:19.825
Don't judge me, Barbara.

234
00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.193
Don't judge her.

235
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.229
-[children chatter]
-Thank you!

236
00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:24.363
[upbeat music]

237
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.898
Wow!

238
00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:31.203
If you didn't already know,
that's super-influencer

239
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.339
Xander Coddington,
AKA, Xan-Man.

240
00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.675
-Group selfie!
-He just moved to Royal Woods,

241
00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.210
and throws
the most epic parties.

242
00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.012
Post that.

243
00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.882
And... you're all famous.
Tag me.

244
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:44.951
Clyde and I have been trying
to get in with Xander

245
00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:46.419
since the day he got into town.

246
00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:48.554
Tune in, Xander Nation,
we're gonna be click-clocking

247
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:51.757
-a hot new game tonight.
-Quick, let's make our move!

248
00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:53.059
Hey, Xander!

249
00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.794
-[both groan]
-[thudding]

250
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.429
Mom, I don't wanna
get a filling.

251
00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:59.198
I'm supposed to do my fit check
in front of the bowling alley.

252
00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.068
You're going. Today's the only
day Dr. Miller can see you.

253
00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:04.603
Actually, Dr. Miller
can't see you today.

254
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.506
My sister scared Barbara,
and she stabbed him in the cheek

255
00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:08.941
with a giant needle.

256
00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:10.109
He's right.

257
00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.777
-[scoffs]
-Bet.

258
00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:12.979
I'm outta here.

259
00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:15.181
-Thanks, um--
-Lincoln. Lincoln Loud.

260
00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:16.983
We go to the same school.

261
00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:18.617
I sit next to you in Science.

262
00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:21.020
You knocked the wind out of me
in dodgeball last week.

263
00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:23.689
Does this look familiar?
[exaggerated gasping]

264
00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:25.358
You're the one
who pooped his pants?

265
00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:28.194
-No, that was my friend, Rusty.
-Oh.

266
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.762
So, any plans for Halloween?

267
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:33.032
You're new. If you need tips
on hot trick-or-treat spots,

268
00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:35.534
me and my best friend Clyde have
created a computer program

269
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.770
that gives you the route
to maximum candy consumption.

270
00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:40.806
Thanks, but I don't do the
trick-or-treating thing anymore.

271
00:10:40.873 --> 00:10:42.842
I gave that up
once I hit middle school.

272
00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:45.277
Kids our age are too old
to be trick-or-treating.

273
00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:46.679
[fake laugh]

274
00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:49.281
What?! No trick-or-treating?!

275
00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:50.916
That's insane.

276
00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:53.586
[awkward chuckle] Yeah. Totally.

277
00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:54.787
I was just giving you tips

278
00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:56.389
in case you wanted
to pass them along

279
00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:59.492
to some younger kids who
clearly aren't as cool as us.

280
00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:00.893
Alright. I gotta bounce.

281
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.096
[laughs] Cool.
Can I, uh, bounce with you?

282
00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:07.166
Or you can bounce by yourself.

283
00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:09.168
If that's how
you prefer to bounce.

284
00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:11.237
[laughs] Deuces, Lincoln.

285
00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.809
You're looking
especially orange today.

286
00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:19.178
Okay, Lisa, your pumpkin is--

287
00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:22.581
Esmeralda is looking great.

288
00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:24.450
She certainly is.

289
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.552
We've taken
quite the journey together.

290
00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:28.621
Oh, that's adorable.

291
00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:33.059
Okay, let's carve
this big girl up!

292
00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:35.394
But I don't wanna
carve Esmeralda up!

293
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:36.695
I'll do it!

294
00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:38.164
I wanna do it!

295
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.266
Do what? I wanna do it!
And I wanna do it the fastest.

296
00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:43.369
I'm gonna put a smile
on that pumpkin's face!

297
00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:44.804
It's mine!

298
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.338
-Let me at that thing!
-No!

299
00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:48.374
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's not get hasty here.

300
00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:50.976
Perhaps we could do something
a little less invasive.

301
00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:52.812
Like drawing
a smiley face on her

302
00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.347
with some nontoxic,
washable markers.

303
00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:59.318
O-M-G, Lisa. Have you become
friends with your pumpkin?

304
00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:01.220
She is. It is ridiculous.

305
00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.589
That thing isn't even human.

306
00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:05.458
[saw buzzing]

307
00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:06.525
That's my chainsaw.

308
00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:09.595
-You snooze, you lose.
-Ooh, ooh.

309
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.032
[chainsaw buzzing]

310
00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:14.533
[excited chatter]

311
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.702
No! No, stop!

312
00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:18.003
Esmeralda!

313
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.739
[suspenseful music]

314
00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:23.342
I know this sounds crazy,

315
00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.744
but I don't think we should
go trick-or-treating.

316
00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.780
Okay, so, just to be clear,

317
00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:31.383
you don't think we should go and
get bags and bags of free candy?

318
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.651
Yes.

319
00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:34.320
Come here.

320
00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:39.125
Just hear me out.

321
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.728
You may change your mind
after you see this.

322
00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:47.032
Ace Savvy and One-Eyed Jack.
We're going old school.

323
00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:49.101
My dads had these made
by the wardrobe lady

324
00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.336
at their theater group.

325
00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:52.972
She sewed in
real fake muscles and abs.

326
00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:56.308
Listen. I know the idea
of not trick-or-treating

327
00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:59.778
sounds ridiculous, but I was
talking to Xander Codding--

328
00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:01.981
Xander Coddington
talked to you?!

329
00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:03.282
He knew who you were?

330
00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:05.284
I had to jog
his memory a little.

331
00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:08.087
But the point is, he said we're
too old for trick-or-treating.

332
00:13:08.154 --> 00:13:09.922
-And I think he's right.
-[scream effect]

333
00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:11.290
Not gonna go trick-or-treating?

334
00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:13.259
We'll never go
trick-or-treating again?

335
00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:15.060
Clyde, you wanna get in
with Xander

336
00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:17.496
-and his amazing parties?
-Yeah.

337
00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:20.432
If we don't get in with him now,
we're gonna get left behind.

338
00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:22.234
I don't wanna spend
the rest of school

339
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:25.571
on the outside of the cool
group just so we can get candy.

340
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:26.839
[scoffs] I mean--

341
00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:28.274
There's the guy that saved me

342
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.675
from that lame dentist visit.

343
00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:33.145
-Lincoln, what's up?
-Hey, Xander. How are you?

344
00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:36.682
-I mean, 'sup? 'Sup.
-'Sup.

345
00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:39.718
I'm having a party tonight
at my crib. You should stop by.

346
00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:41.987
Yeah. Cool.

347
00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:44.290
Sure. Cool. Totally.

348
00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:45.858
My brother
works at the junkyard,

349
00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:49.428
and he found this old disco
ball, so it's gonna be #fancy.

350
00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:50.863
Sweet.

351
00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:53.732
Hey, Clyde. What's good?

352
00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.134
[sputters]

353
00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:57.303
What's good? [exaggerated laugh]

354
00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:58.671
Everything's good.

355
00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:01.340
It's all good.
It's all good in the hood.

356
00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:03.776
[whispers] He knows my name.

357
00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:05.844
Tight.

358
00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:07.546
-Tight.
-Tight.

359
00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:08.781
Super tight.

360
00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:11.383
Hey, uh, nice costumes.

361
00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:15.354
-Those aren't ours.
-We were just saving them

362
00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:17.189
for some young
trick-or-treaters,

363
00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:19.291
because we don't
do that anymore.

364
00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:21.126
Alright, see ya tonight.

365
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.866
[both] We're so going
to Xander's party!

366
00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.936
My apologies, Esmeralda.

367
00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:33.305
But your smile
looks simply splendid.

368
00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:36.041
[faint spooky music]

369
00:14:36.108 --> 00:14:38.477
[wind howling]

370
00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:41.847
[lighter flicking]

371
00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:44.617
-[gasps]
-Gasp.

372
00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:47.286
It's not polite to sneak up
on people like that.

373
00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:48.787
That's why I'm hiding down here.

374
00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:51.390
You'd tell me if Lynn
was down here, right?

375
00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:52.558
Maybe.

376
00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:56.595
Alright, I'm just, uh, you know,
setting up a little

377
00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:59.298
Lynn-tastic Relaxation Station.
See?

378
00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:01.267
-[chuckles]
-Why?

379
00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:03.402
Well, maybe because I'm, uh...

380
00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:05.437
What is the word? Um...

381
00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:07.906
spiraling into insanity?!

382
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.376
Can you spiral over to that box

383
00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:12.544
and see if
there's a head in a jar?

384
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.148
Why would you put a head--

385
00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:18.450
You know what?
I don't want to know.

386
00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.353
[shouts]

387
00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:25.691
Why would you put my--

388
00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.227
You know what?
I still don't want to know.

389
00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.429
I'm just gonna put me back now.

390
00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:31.997
-[slicing sound]
-Ow!

391
00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:34.600
[groans] What the heck?

392
00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:37.770
Uh-oh. That's not good.

393
00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:39.405
Define "not good."

394
00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:41.640
Nothing.
[chuckles half-heartedly]

395
00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:47.212
What did I just cut myself with?

396
00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.714
Sigh.

397
00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.115
Define "sigh".

398
00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:53.218
That's a ceremonial necklace
made from the teeth of Romulus,

399
00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.754
the most vicious werewolf
the world has ever seen.

400
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:58.524
One scratch,
and your fate is sealed.

401
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.193
You will be transformed
into a hairy,

402
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.096
bloodthirsty, feral beast.

403
00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:06.198
[distant snarl]

404
00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:07.599
Okay.

405
00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:10.002
You should probably put
a warning on these things.

406
00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:15.874
[musical flourish]

407
00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:18.477
I did not see that.

408
00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:20.512
-[squishing sounds]
-Ah!

409
00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:22.781
You'll also have an insatiable
appetite for meat.

410
00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:25.517
Huh, well, eh, I just had lunch,
so, you know...

411
00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:27.553
I mean, yeah, sure,
I could go for a steak,

412
00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:29.822
but I could go for
a lot of things, like a...

413
00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:32.658
That's funny.
I was gonna say steak again.

414
00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:36.028
How come I can't
stop thinking about steaks?

415
00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:37.529
[cow mooing sound]

416
00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:39.598
-[whistle blows]
-[Lori] Family meeting!

417
00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.633
-I guess I'm gonna go upstairs.
-[box clatters]

418
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.302
-[Lucy] Careful!
-[stammering]

419
00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:46.405
That's a little...
Hang in there, Lynn.

420
00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:48.374
[howling sound]

421
00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:52.411
Gonna get through this, Lynn.
You're gonna get through this.

422
00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:56.348
Wait. These are just
my fake goblin teeth.

423
00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:58.016
Harmless.

424
00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:03.255
[sighs] People,
we have to close the fridge.

425
00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:06.925
[shouts] Lynn! Ohh! Luan!

426
00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:10.629
Can I have a bite of that?

427
00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:18.036
[snarls]

428
00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:20.606
[ferocious eating sounds]

429
00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:27.312
Wow, you ate that like
a bloodthirsty, feral beast.

430
00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:28.747
[gasps]

431
00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:29.982
[dramatic music]

432
00:17:30.048 --> 00:17:31.316
It's starting.

433
00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:36.922
Tell the others I'm not gonna
make it to the meeting.

434
00:17:37.456 --> 00:17:38.824
And, um...

435
00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:41.760
I'm just gonna go
down to the basement.

436
00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:43.929
Do you mind locking the door
behind me?

437
00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:47.032
Not because I'm turning into
a werewolf or anything. It's...

438
00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:48.801
something else.

439
00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:56.942
-Lock the door!
-Okay.

440
00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:02.981
-My dad is weird.
-[whistle blows]

441
00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:05.117
[angry chatter]

442
00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.121
-[blows whistle]
-[chatter stops]

443
00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:10.489
I literally cannot believe

444
00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:12.424
that you are bailing
on the Spooktacular.

445
00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:15.360
-And trick-or-treating!
-Who passes up free candy?

446
00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:17.362
Clyde and I are
too old to dress up.

447
00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.865
Yeah. Besides, it's just candy.

448
00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.433
Come here.

449
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.001
Yes, come here.

450
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.138
-Ow!
-Bozos.

451
00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:29.675
-[chatter resumes]
-I should've seen that coming.

452
00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.811
Okay, skip trick-or-treating
if you want,

453
00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:34.746
but the Spooktacular
is a loud tradition.

454
00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.849
I came home
from college for this.

455
00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:39.985
Our collective attendance record
has been 100 percent.

456
00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:43.021
-One hundred.
-And, we've never missed one.

457
00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:45.791
The entire town is gonna be here
in two hours!

458
00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:50.128
And without you, we don't have
a surprise finale.

459
00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:51.763
You can still change your mind.

460
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.265
[all agreeing]

461
00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:54.666
I'm sorry, but...

462
00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:56.702
Clyde and I have made
our decision.

463
00:18:56.768 --> 00:18:58.837
-Mmm.
-We're going to Xander's party.

464
00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:01.006
It's gonna be
the coolest thing ever.

465
00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:03.041
-That's so lame.
-Lame.

466
00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:04.543
What's so cool about it anyways?

467
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.845
What even happens
at one of Xander's parties?

468
00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:09.114
[excited chatter]

469
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.487
That's when Clyde and I realized
we were in over our heads.

470
00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:18.090
What happens
at a middle school party?

471
00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:20.859
Seriously. What happens?

472
00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:22.127
I have no idea.

473
00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:23.495
I can't believe you got invited

474
00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:25.364
to Xander Coddington's party.

475
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.766
-They're epic.
-He's that internet feller.

476
00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.536
-Must be nice.
-He doesn't even know I exist.

477
00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:32.204
He doesn't even know my name.

478
00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:33.939
He knew my name.

479
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.107
Did he know my name?

480
00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:37.676
He remembered you pooped
your pants in dodgeball.

481
00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:40.412
Yes! In. Your. Faces.

482
00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.314
In your gym shorts.

483
00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:45.117
-You should come with us.
-We've got better things to do.

484
00:19:45.183 --> 00:19:46.585
Yeah, we do.

485
00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:48.787
While you guys are rubbing
elbows with Xander,

486
00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:51.290
we're gonna catch ourselves
a Cryptid.

487
00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.025
Yee-haw!

488
00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:55.527
You really gonna climb
that mountain again?

489
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:57.563
Clyde has a point.

490
00:19:57.629 --> 00:19:59.398
Our enthusiasm
for monster hunting

491
00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:01.366
vastly outweighs our abilities.

492
00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:03.335
Tonight's the night.
I can feel it.

493
00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.003
Guys, let's stay focused.

494
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.573
We have no idea what happens
at a middle school party.

495
00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:08.707
What do we wear?

496
00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:12.010
Maybe some big city suit,
like the Monopoly guy?

497
00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:15.948
You can never go wrong
with a top hat and a monocle.

498
00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:18.183
[curious music]

499
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.651
-Moving on.
-Dancing.

500
00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:21.920
-Thumbs up or thumbs down?
-Way down.

501
00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:23.889
Xander will be
doing moves so trendy,

502
00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.991
they haven't been invented yet.

503
00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:28.126
I know a thing or two
about square dancing.

504
00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:31.797
Oh! Talking about aliens
is always a good ice breaker.

505
00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:35.434
You guys need more
than what we can offer.

506
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.337
Might I suggest
your friend and mine,

507
00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:40.939
the internet, check it out.

508
00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:46.345
[owl hooting]

509
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.080
Everybody in their places!

510
00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:49.181
-Check.
-Check.

511
00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:50.248
-Check.
-Check.

512
00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:51.316
-Check.
-Check.

513
00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:52.384
-Check.
-Check.

514
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.486
-Check.
-Check. Meow.

515
00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:55.621
Candy Cannon?

516
00:20:55.687 --> 00:20:57.656
Cannon ready. Waiting for candy.

517
00:20:57.723 --> 00:21:00.192
Lynn, how's it coming with
the Headless Horseman?

518
00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:02.794
Still headless.

519
00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:06.999
Mmm. Ketchup.

520
00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:08.967
Mom, where's the candy?

521
00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:11.937
[sighs] After our disastrous
trip to the dentist,

522
00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.606
I realized the error of my ways.

523
00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:16.041
No more cavities.

524
00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:20.178
So, this year, we're giving away
toothbrushes.

525
00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:22.280
[dramatic music]

526
00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:27.319
No! [echoes]

527
00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:30.489
Oh, yeah. I got a bunch more!

528
00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:32.157

So we can sabotage
this preteen mob.

888
00:38:28.105 --> 00:38:30.775
So, I'm not exactly sure
what's going on here.

889
00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:33.678
But I do know it's not good.

890
00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:37.314
-So not good.
-We could build a time machine

891
00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:40.317
and go back in time before you
handed out those toothbrushes.

892
00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:42.820
Helping or hurting, Lola?

893
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:46.824
They so much as lay
a finger on Esmeralda,

894
00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:48.759
they will feel the wrath

895
00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:50.761
-of Lisa Loud!
-Wrath!

896
00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:53.030
No one cares
about that pumpkin.

897
00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:54.665
-Todd!
-What?

898
00:38:54.732 --> 00:38:57.401
We were all thinking it.

899
00:38:57.468 --> 00:39:00.037
This house needs a remodel.

900
00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:01.472
Fire!

901
00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.674
[kids shouting]

902
00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:07.611
Toilet paper!

903
00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:11.015
We're under attack!

904
00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:17.021
[Xander] Aim for windows!
Throw it to the front porch!

905
00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:19.957
We really didn't
think this through.

906
00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:21.959
-What are we gonna do?!
-Fight back!

907
00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:24.328
-Are you kidding?
-Grab the toilet paper!

908
00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:28.933
-Mom's phone.
-It's Lincoln!

909
00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:31.368
-Oh, no. Lincoln's not home.
-I'm Lincoln!

910
00:39:31.435 --> 00:39:33.804
Ohh! This is Lincoln.

911
00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:37.141
-Leni, give the phone to Mom.
-It's Lincoln.

912
00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:39.710
Hi, sweetie. Have you eaten?

913
00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:42.546
-Mom, are you serious?
-Are you enjoying the party?

914
00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:44.348
'Cause we're literally
getting attacked.

915
00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:47.685
Yeah, Clyde and I are outside
with the angry mob.

916
00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:49.487
But we're gonna work
as double agents,

917
00:39:49.553 --> 00:39:50.654
and help protect the house.

918
00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:52.156
Why are you with the angry mob?

919
00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:55.893
We were... coming home early
to see the Spooktacular.

920
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.161
And they just happened
to be here.

921
00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:59.597
Oh! It was so shocking.
Imagine our shock.

922
00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:01.699
-[all groan]
-I mean, I was just--

923
00:40:01.766 --> 00:40:03.834
Okay, fam, here's the plan.

924
00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:06.003
We fight them off
using the Spooktacular.

925
00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.572
-[all agree]
-Lana, you're on Candy Cannon.

926
00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:10.074
-Copy that.
-Luan?

927
00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:12.543
Crank up Franken-coconuts.
Create some diversions.

928
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.778
I've got some good material.

929
00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:15.846
-A ghost, a goblin, and a--
-Zip it!

930
00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:19.016
Lucy, do what you do best.
Start scaring people.

931
00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:21.118
-You know it.
-I'm gonna do what I do best,

932
00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:23.888
-and beat your record.
-Game on.

933
00:40:23.954 --> 00:40:26.557
Everybody else, follow my lead.
All right.

934
00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:29.026
Louds on three. One, two--

935
00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:33.063
-[all] Louds!
-A little early, but okay.

936
00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.732
Let's do this.

937
00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:37.568
-Let's get Loud!
-[all] Whoo!

938
00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:39.336
Lana, upstairs now!

939
00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:41.939
[spooky music]

940
00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:44.275
[boy] Brush your teeth
with this!

941
00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:46.110
[screaming]

942
00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:49.947
Oh, the humanity!

943
00:40:50.614 --> 00:40:51.782
Yeah!

944
00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:55.219
Come on, Luan, come on.

945
00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:01.425
Hey, bozos!

946
00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:02.993
Take a hike! [laughs]

947
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.196
-What?
-Let's get 'em!

948
00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:08.699
[chaotic shouting]

949
00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:11.535
It's alive! [exaggerated laugh]

950
00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:13.504
Lana's in position.

951
00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:15.706
[suspenseful music]

952
00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.876
Hey, Xander!
That porch looks too clean!

953
00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:20.945
-Yeah.
-Let's get closer!

954
00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:23.647
-[both whooping]
-Okay. Good call, Lincoln.

955
00:41:23.714 --> 00:41:25.616
Come on, trash the porch!

956
00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:27.751
[laughter]

957
00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:31.055
Who's ready for their closeup?

958
00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:35.392
[shouts] I've been hit!

959
00:41:35.459 --> 00:41:38.028
[all shouting]

960
00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:42.833
You got it, Mom.

961
00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:46.270
Keep 'em coming.

962
00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:49.707
That giant pumpkin
is going down!

963
00:41:49.773 --> 00:41:52.810
-No!
-Lisa!

964
00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:56.380
[all groan]

965
00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:59.750
Kind of ironic I hit him with
the pumpkin pie filling.

966
00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:01.118
Gross.

967
00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:04.054
Lisa, come inside! We got this!

968
00:42:04.121 --> 00:42:07.458
Stay strong, Esmeralda!

969
00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:09.326
[both] It's working!

970
00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:13.197
This beat down is brought to you
by the letter "C."

971
00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:19.069
For Candy Cannon and contusions!

972
00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:20.471
Stupid--

973
00:42:20.537 --> 00:42:22.706
[panting]

974
00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:23.908
[suspenseful music]

975
00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:25.876
Hit the driveway, come on!

976
00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:28.112
[screams]

977
00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:33.984
[chiming]

978
00:42:34.852 --> 00:42:36.387
Come on, go on!

979
00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:39.423
Go. Go now. Now, now.

980
00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.091
Trash the horseman!

981
00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:44.161
-Booyah!
-[all scream]

982
00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:46.196
-[machinery whirs]
-[all shout]

983
00:42:46.263 --> 00:42:49.133
Hey, as Mick Swagger would say,

984
00:42:49.199 --> 00:42:51.602
"You're about to have
a bloody good time."

985
00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:53.137
[kids groaning and shouting]

986
00:42:55.773 --> 00:42:57.875
Oh, disgusting!

987
00:42:57.942 --> 00:42:59.576
[screaming continues]

988
00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:03.147
[laughter]

989
00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:05.916
Candy. Oh!

990
00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:07.251
[panting]

991
00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:08.319
[dramatic music]

992
00:43:08.385 --> 00:43:10.187
Candy!

993
00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:13.991
No!

994
00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:17.294
Candy! Oh.

995
00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:19.530
-[collar clicks]
-[Stella] Got him.

996
00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:21.899
Hello, wolf.

997
00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:24.068
Stay back. I'm Lincoln's--

998
00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:27.438
-[zapping]
-[sputtering]

999
00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:29.139
What is that?

1000
00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:31.275
That there is
a canine shock collar.

1001
00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:33.010
Zaps him every time he talks.

1002
00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:34.445
-No.
-[zapping]

1003
00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:35.879
It's even got a remote.

1004
00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:38.182
[stammers and groans]

1005
00:43:38.248 --> 00:43:39.750
Don't use that on a mule though.

1006
00:43:39.817 --> 00:43:41.418
I learned that the hard way.

1007
00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:43.020
It's over!

1008
00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:44.888
[all shouting]

1009
00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:47.224
[shouts continue]

1010
00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:05.709
It might be the candy talking,

1011
00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:07.678
but I feel so alive!

1012
00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:08.746
Yeah!

1013
00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:10.614
[all] Yeah!

1014
00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:13.484
[chaotic shouting]

1015
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:15.953
Stop hitting us with food!

1016
00:44:17.788 --> 00:44:19.490
[Luan laughs]

1017
00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:24.995
The sticks are the best!
[laughing]

1018
00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:26.630
Keep 'em coming.

1019
00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:28.499
[dramatic music]

1020
00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:32.102
Watch your flank!
She's getting away!

1021
00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:35.039
[boy] Oh, man.
That's so gross! Oh!

1022
00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:39.543
Where is your father
with that candy?!

1023
00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.246
We're almost out of ammo!

1024
00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:44.548
I repeat,
we're almost out of ammo!

1025
00:44:44.615 --> 00:44:45.816
Basement team, you're up.

1026
00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:48.018
-On it. Come on.
-I'll signal Lincoln.

1027
00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:50.487
[suspenseful music]

1028
00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:55.292
Hey, Xander, let's sneak through
that stupid yet well-constructed

1029
00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.227
corn maze
and do a Backyard Blitz!

1030
00:44:57.294 --> 00:45:00.064
Nice! Guys, go, go, go!

1031
00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:03.133
[all shouting]

1032
00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:06.537
I didn't say
who was getting blitzed.

1033
00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:08.238
[both shouting]

1034
00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:10.240
Hurry.

1035
00:45:10.307 --> 00:45:11.809
Guys, they're coming!

1036
00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:13.444
[whispered chatter]

1037
00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:17.114
[spooky music]

1038
00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:25.055
Head that way!

1039
00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:26.924
-[low growl]
-Boo.

1040
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.058
-[all scream]
-Boo.

1041
00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:29.560
-Boo.
-[all scream]

1042
00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:32.663
Boo. Boo again.

1043
00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:36.233
-[all shouting]
-[boy] Let's get out of here.

1044
00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:39.503
No! No, it's a trap!

1045
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.138
For Esmeralda!

1046
00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:44.341
[all screaming, shouting]

1047
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:53.150
Yes.

1048
00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:54.952
[screaming continues]

1049
00:45:55.018 --> 00:45:56.687
Come on! This way, this way!

1050
00:45:56.753 --> 00:45:58.822
Come on. Come on, over here.
Hurry, hurry.

1051
00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:00.290
No one messes with the Louds.

1052
00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:03.327
-This is our house.
-[dramatic music]

1053
00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:05.996
-[Xander] Come on. Hurry.
-[boy] Come on, in the driveway!

1054
00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:07.564
[Xander] Over here. This way.

1055
00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:10.134
-[panting]
-We barely made it through!

1056
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.269
I say we cut our losses
and get outta here.

1057
00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:14.071
No way! It's like you said.

1058
00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.540
The toothbrush house
needs to get destroyed.

1059
00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:20.077
-[phone alerts chiming]
-See, even my followers agree.

1060
00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:24.148
Open window.
Perfect spot for these.

1061
00:46:24.214 --> 00:46:28.118
-[both] Stink bombs?
-Industrial stink bombs.

1062
00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:29.853
It's time for my grand finale.

1063
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.522

1068

Clyde,
it's time for my grand finale.

1069
00:46:48.138 --> 00:46:50.007
I just have to get inside.

1070
00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:52.176
No way. If Xander sees
we're not together,

1071
00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:54.545
he's gonna know
we're up to something.

just give him a wave.

Good job, Lincoln.

1142
00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:50.347
I am so glad you showed up
when you did.

1143
00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:51.915
That was serendipitous.

1144
00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.884
You're a real hero, Lincoln.

1145
00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:59.723
I didn't do this to be a hero.
Actually--

1146
00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:01.858
Oh, look. Someone posted
a video of Lincoln.

just not watch that right now?

-I wonder what it is.
-Or delete it.

-And watch it never.
-Even better.

We can't let these people
off the hook.

was your idea?

-In theory. Yes.
-But we can explain.

So, first you bail
on the Spooktacular.

-And then you try to destroy it.
-Disappointed sigh.

Lincoln's mess.

How did this all go so wrong?

1171
00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:09.559
I mean, getting Xander
to like us

1172
00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:11.995
and attacking our own house,
seemed rock solid.

1173

who still likes us.

was the reason we did all this.

my whole family,

[song ends]

1241
00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:47.610

1244
00:55:54.617 --> 00:55:55.885
We have to call the police!

1245
00:55:55.952 --> 00:55:57.454
I don't think the police
care about a pumpkin.

1246
00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.122
We'll file
a missing person report.

1247
00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:01.691
-She's not a person.
-Preach, girl.

-Not now, Lily.

1249
00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:06.029
-I have a video.
-Not now, Leni.

1250
00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:08.832
What kind of person
would want to hurt Esmeralda?

1251
00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:11.735
I have an alibi.

1252
00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:13.636
[Lana] Yeah, right, dude. Sure.

1253
00:56:13.703 --> 00:56:16.139
-Lincoln in pumpkin.
-Not now, Lily.

1254
00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:18.742

You thought the toothbrush
people won?

1257
00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:24.948
Well, guess again. We're on
our way to the junkyard.

1258
00:56:25.014 --> 00:56:28.718
Gonna see what happens when
we take their precious pumpkin

1259
00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:31.054

into the car crusher!

That jerk's gonna smash
Lisa's pumpkin!

1274
00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:20.703
I can't believe
I suggested this place

1275
00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:22.839
for a Recycling Club field trip.

1276
00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:31.748
Alright, man with the plan,
what do ya got?

1277
00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:34.117
Easy. We wait
for the truck to stop.

1278
00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:36.152
Then we run out
that giant, open door.

1279
00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:42.759

1288
00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.016
Then fire up that crusher,

that toothbrush house a lesson!

I just wanna go home and take
a bath and eat a cookie.
