1
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.160
Hey, Wayne, do you think this is
some sort of drill or something?

2
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.400
Beats me, partner.

3
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.440
She said to meet her here immediately.

4
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.600
-You're late.
-(BOTH EXCLAIM)

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.720
Lanny. Wayne.

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.480
Uh, roasting chestnuts, Magee!
What's the deal here?

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.000
I know as much as you do.

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.200
Clearly a "Silent Night" operation.

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.640
-Your contact is waiting in there.
-(BELL TINKLING)

10
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.360
Good luck.

11
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.400
And if something happens to you,
I just wanted to say

12
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.040
I'm claiming your snowmobile.

13
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.240
-I cancelled the insurance.
-Okay, bye!

14
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.640
LANNY: (WHISPERING) What does
she mean "If something happens?"

15
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.000
-And who's this contact?
-Come on, it's the Big Guy's sleigh,

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.680
it could only be one person.

17
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.080
BOTH: (GASPING) Mrs. Claus!

18
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.520
(SHUSHING)

19
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.280
MRS. CLAUS:
(SOFTLY) Keep your voices down.

20
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.360
Would you boys
like some hot chocolate?

21
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.120
I'm not sure if
it's appropriate for a secret meeting,

22
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.680
(CHUCKLES) but, what the heck.

23
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.520
Anything for you
Prep and Landing elves.

24
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.320
Aren't you the stealthy ones?

25
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.960
Yup, that's us.

26
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.520
Oh, good. Because I have
an important mission for you.

27
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.480
I need your special skills
in retrieving this item.

28
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.000
-A wooden box?
-It's tucked away in a secure location.

29
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.320
-Inside Santa's office.
-(STARTLED GRUNT)

30
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.280
Of course, he practically lives there,
he's so busy this time of year.

31
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.800
But he does take his daily nap
just before 3:00.

32
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.960
I've recorded some more details
on this little doohickey here.

33
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.000
Don't let me down, boys.

34
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.960
LANNY: This is a bad idea, Wayne!

35
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.280
Sneaking into Santa's office?
While he's sleeping?

36
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.440
We're going on the
Naughty List for sure!

37
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.920
-What's this?
-My hat.

38
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.320
And what are you doing right now?

39
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.160
Um... Worrying?

40
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.280
And what do we do when we worry?

41
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.480
Put it in the hat?

42
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.640
Very good.

43
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.800
(BEEPING)

44
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.560
Stay in the hat. Stay in the hat.
Stay in the hat.

(GASPS)

48
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.720
Lanny? Wayne?

49
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.920
What do you think...

50
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.920
-You two are going on the Naughty List!
-(SIGHS)

51
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.760
You get coal!

52
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.800
Ho! Ho! Go!

53
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.440
(SHIVERS)

54
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.600
WAYNE: (WHISPERING)
Lanny. Hey, hey, hey, Lanny.

55
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.320
-Huh?
-(CLEARING THROAT)

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.440
(SNORES)

57
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.280
I think my hat is leaking!

58
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.960
MRS. CLAUS ON SPEAKER: <i>I hope</i>
<i>this is recording. Is this thing on? Okay.</i>

59
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.400
<i>This tree thingy</i>
<i>should be on the bookshelf.</i>

60
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.760
<i>You need to</i>
<i>lock each section into place.</i>

61
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.440
I was never that good at
trimming the tree.

62
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.920
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
The most festive side always faces out.

63
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.760
Got it!

64
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.800

-(BOTH GASP)

66
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.640
-What's happening?
-I have no idea!

67
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.880
Please don't wake up.
Please don't wake up.

68
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.440
(GASPS) Great garland!

69
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.640
MRS. CLAUS: <i>By now you should be in</i>
<i>Santa's Secret Workshop.</i>

70
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.360
<i>This is where my husband likes to</i>
<i>tinker around</i>

71
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.160
<i>and keeps all of his treasures and...</i>

72
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.560
<i>Oh, gosh, mostly just stuff</i>
<i>I don't want in my house.</i>

73
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.720
This is so tinsel!

74
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.360
<i>Oh, watch out for that giant Nutcracker!</i>

75
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.440
(GASPS)

76
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.800
<i>We used to have it in our foyer</i>
<i>and I would trip over that thing.</i>

77
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.560
<i>They should have called it</i>
<i>a hip cracker.</i>

78
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.360
<i>Now, let's see. The box is probably</i>
<i>somewhere around his work bench.</i>

79
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.960
<i>Just look for that giant pile of</i>
<i>manly clutter.</i>

80
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.360
Jingle Time.

81
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.280
(BOTH GRUNTING)

82
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.400
You know what this calls for?

83
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.280
The old Gift Exchange!

84
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.560
-Yes!
-Great job, Tree skirt.

Oh, frostbite.

(GRUNTING)

89
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.040
Permission to worry now?

90
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.120
Permission granted.

92
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.640

MRS. CLAUS: Oh,
I've waited so long for this day!

96
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.640
Santa's had this wheel piece
tucked away for a long time now,

97
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.840
but the rest of it,
I finally managed to find again.

98
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.040
What is it?

99
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.200
Merry Christmas, sweetheart!

100
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.320
THE BIG GUY:
Oh, my. Is this what I think it is?

101
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.040
The first toy I ever made.

102
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.920
Thank you. Thank you all so much.

103
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.800
(SNIFFLES)
Mission accomplished, partner.

104
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.240
I really wanted that snowmobile.
