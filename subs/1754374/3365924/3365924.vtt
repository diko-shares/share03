00:00:02.195 --> 00:00:03.704
В предыдущих сериях...

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.823
Большинство из нас "особенные"

3
00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:07.136
Мы можем делать что-то действительно странное

4
00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:08.151
очень классно.

5
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:09.227
Итак, в какую же сторону отсюда дом?

6
00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:10.362
Может мы можем использовать тунели?

7
00:00:10.462 --> 00:00:13.180
Мы ещё не нашли какие-либо туннели до той части кампуса.

8
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.609
Я думаю моя способность развивается

9
00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.304
на психологическом профиле, просто анализируя их почерк.

10
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:19.281
Несмотря на отличный лидерский потенциал

11
00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:21.370
субъект предпочитает идти своим путём.

12
00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:23.639
(Суки)Если даже шпионы имеют группы поддержки.

13
00:00:23.674 --> 00:00:25.541
Это коллективные усилия, не спеши.

14
00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:31.180
Я не могу позволить чтоб планы Арчера сбежать помешали моим планам.

15
00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:35.151
"Одисей"
классическая сказка

16
00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:40.056
как человек из эпической серии стремился вернуться домой.

17
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.659
История содержит почти все самые интересные примеры,

18
00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:47.063
описательного характера героя.

19
00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:49.565
Именно, необходимо путешествие героя

20
00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:51.634
часто с помощью сверхъестественного гида

21
00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:53.569
через странный таинственный мир

22
00:00:53.603 --> 00:00:56.305
преодоления препятствий и разбирательств

23
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.008
выживания во встречах с чудовищными существами,

24
00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:02.345
прохождения символической смерти и возрождения,

25
00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.981
перед тем, как он наконец триумфально вернётся домой

26
00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:08.284
с накопленной мудростью из его стремления.

27
00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.020
Сэр, вы упомянули чудовищных тварей.

28
00:01:11.054 --> 00:01:13.956
Есть ли шанс, прочитать про вампиров в этой книге?

29
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:17.126
Темные, задумчивые вампиры

30
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.629
которые знают, что они не должны влюбляться,
в обычных смертных, девушек,

31
00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:22.765
хотя знают что обречены на это
с самого начала

32
00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.335
потому что любовь
это все что у нас есть?

33
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.037
- Нет.

34
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:33.209
Оборотни?
Любые темные, задумчивые оборотни?

35
00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:36.212
Греческая мифология кишит известными существами.

36
00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:41.317
Это Медуза. Наполовину человек, наполовину бык- минотавр

37
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:44.153
Но, для твоей монстролюбивой натуры

38
00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:48.457
Особенности Одиссея - любящий человеческое мясо, одноглазый цилоп

39
00:01:48.492 --> 00:01:50.693
- [murmuring]
- Barf.

40
00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:54.563
В частности, герой Одиссея победил многих знаменитых существ

41
00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:58.868
There's the deadly seductive female
Sirens, being another notorious example.

42
00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:01.237
The important thing
to remember is that the hero

43
00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:03.205
must not only survive
these encounters

44
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.241
but learn something from them.

45
00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:06.909
Да, сэр?

46
00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:09.245
Могу я получить другую книгу. В этой много подчеркиваний

47
00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:13.182
и пометок

48
00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:16.419
Мне жаль, мистер Арчер. Книга уже зарегистрирована на ваше имя.

49
00:02:18.522 --> 00:02:20.056
Мне, вот интересно, это потому что деньги выделенные на книги

50
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.158
были потрачены на огромную стену вокруг школы?

51
00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:24.760
Через две недели будет тест
(бурчит)

52
00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:27.430
Советую вам прочитать учебник

53
00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:30.032
как герои ищущие приключений

54
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:33.269
In a typical myth, when a hero
is given his task,

55
00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:38.274
he initially refuses, either
out of fear or immaturity.

56
00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:40.576
<i>57
00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.921

58
00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:00.396
(мужик поет)

59
00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:05.301

<i>69
00:03:27.858 --> 00:03:29.959
Отлично. Только напомни

70
00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:32.094
Завтра тест по Одисею

71
00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.331
(бурчание)
(прочищая глотку) Завтра?

72
00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:37.733
Уже прошло 2 недели с того момента, когда я задал вам прочитать Одиссея

73
00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:40.836
Я предполагаю вы закончили чтение?

74
00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:44.473
(звонок)

75
00:03:44.508 --> 00:03:47.543
(уходят)

76
00:03:47.577 --> 00:03:49.912
Ребята, вы дочитали?

77
00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:52.915
Закончили?
Да мы еще не начинали

78
00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.583
Ты пирожок!:D

79
00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.387
Поджаренный

80
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:01.891
Простите меня сэр, но мне интересно

81
00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:05.294
как сильно тест отразится на конечной оценке по вашему предмету?

82
00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:08.497
если ты завалишь тест, то ты завалишь и предмет

83
00:04:08.532 --> 00:04:12.067
Из твоего вопроса я понимаю, что так и не закончил чтение книги.

84
00:04:12.102 --> 00:04:15.104
Не совсем так.
Но это потому, что я так втянулся

85
00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:18.974
Я читаю очень медленно, но только потому, что хочу понять все нюансы.

86
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.911
В частности, есть ли способ чтобы получить больше времени

87
00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:24.446
чтобы закончить и взять тесты по макияжу(?)

88
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:27.750
Знаете, Арчер, вы напоминаете мне Одиссея в юности

89
00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:29.118
Кого?

90
00:04:31.388 --> 00:04:34.490
Главного персонажа книги, которой вы так увлечены

91
00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.492
Ах да, конечно.

92
00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.994
Я..Я не знаю как правильно произнести его имя.

93
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.230
как я вам его напоминаю?

94
00:04:41.264 --> 00:04:45.201
Вы оба имеете благородную натуру, и вы оба хитры

95
00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:47.670
You seem to have
wandered a little off course.

96
00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.505
тест завтра.

97
00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:53.042
и что будет если я провалю?

98
00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:55.778
ты будешь сдавать пока не сдаш

99
00:04:55.812 --> 00:04:57.546
а что если я никогда не сдам тест?

100
00:04:57.581 --> 00:05:00.049
как школа отреагирует если я

101
00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:02.451
решу не делать мою домашнюю работу

102
00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:04.486
или решу бросить?

103
00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:06.789
не тебе выбирать бросать школу познания или нет

104
00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:08.891
ты не можешь бросить школу до выпуска

105
00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:12.127
и не можешь выпустится пока не закончишь все классы

106
00:05:12.162 --> 00:05:14.463
и как долго занимает учеба?

107
00:05:14.497 --> 00:05:18.133
давай надеется, что не так долго, как Одисей возвращался домой

108
00:05:18.168 --> 00:05:19.735
так как долго?

109
00:05:24.274 --> 00:05:26.075
Хорошо
(хлопает)

110
00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:28.244
Я даже не начал чтение книги

111
00:05:28.278 --> 00:05:30.045
- Как долго заняло его возвращение домой?
-10 лет

112
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.314
10 лет?

113
00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.982
Другими словами, вы говорите, что я могу пробыть здесь 10 лет?

114
00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:37.882
115
00:05:37.884 --> 00:05:40.912
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
== for www.addic7ed.com ==

116
00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:43.392
Целых 10 лет?

117
00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:46.829
Нет.. я имею ввиду - когда выпускной?

118
00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:49.832
- Как они проводят церемонию выпуска?
- Церемонию?

119
00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:53.369
Они не имеют выпускной церемонии?

120
00:05:53.403 --> 00:05:55.838
Так как мы узнаем, что кто-то действительно заканчивает обучение?

121
00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:59.675
Every year, the seniors
just are gone.

122
00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:02.011
One day, the seniors
just up and vanish?

123
00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:04.380
Come on. You guys don't
find that a little bit odd?

124
00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:06.015
But you know
what's even weirder?

125
00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:08.817
Every year,
when the seniors disappear,

126
00:06:08.852 --> 00:06:12.755
the cafeteria starts serving this,
like, mysterious beef stew.

127
00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.424
- Я серьезно.
- Я тоже

128
00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.160
We don't have time to worry
about this stuff now.

129
00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:21.330
- We have to focus on worrying
about failing our test tomorrow.
- [sighs]

130
00:06:21.364 --> 00:06:23.666
We need one of
those study guides

131
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.735
that tells you what happens in the novel
without having to actually read it.

132
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.505
[Gabe] Good luck trying to find
a study aid like that here.

133
00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.641
Whisper will block certain searches you
try to do on topics we're studying.

134
00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:35.811
[Ian]
What if I'm trying
to do legitimate research?

135
00:06:35.845 --> 00:06:38.414
Bro, that's not legitimate research.
You're trying to cheat.

136
00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:40.416
Виспер не должна

137
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.151
Виспер этого не знает

138
00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:44.253
(шепет)
Виспер знает все

139
00:06:44.287 --> 00:06:47.656
Но дело в том, что Виспер должна спасти наши задницы

140
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:50.326
Она только что предложила мне скачать аудиокнигу Одиссея

141
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.662
Нам остается только сидеть и слушать

142
00:06:53.697 --> 00:06:55.064
Все в порядке

143
00:06:55.098 --> 00:06:56.565
Бум

144

She's taking longer to read it than would
actually take for us just to read it.

153
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.959
- [clicks off]
- Is there any way
to make it go faster?

154
00:07:23.993 --> 00:07:26.328
- A speed reader version?
- I got it.

155
00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:30.933
There's that kid down the hall,
Flash McNulty.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:38.707
- [sigh continues]
- So the nickname's ironic, huh?

158
00:07:38.742 --> 00:07:42.211
So, uh, you'll help
us out then? Huh?

159
00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:45.948
Sure. I've always wanted
to read <i>The Odyssey.</i>

160
00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:48.684
I like things with lots of...

161
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.953
(часы тикают)

162
00:07:50.987 --> 00:07:53.689
(звон)

163
00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:58.660
[sniffs]

164
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.231
экшена

165
00:08:13.877 --> 00:08:16.478
Блин, он умирает

166
00:08:16.513 --> 00:08:18.847
Отлично

167
00:08:18.882 --> 00:08:21.550
Обычно, мы называем это "спойлер"

168
00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:22.985
Но я так думаю, что мы именно для этого здесь

169
00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:24.186
Как умирает герой?

170
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.955
Не герой, его песик

171
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.958
Одиссей наконец-то возвращается домой спустя 10 лет

172
00:08:29.993 --> 00:08:32.928
и единственный, кто знает его -это его собака

173
00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:34.997
Аргус, который машет хвостиком

174
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:37.266
А потом умирает

175
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.767
(плач)

176
00:08:38.802 --> 00:08:40.969
(СиДжей) Все в порядке

177
00:08:41.004 --> 00:08:43.705
Это неправда.
Это всего лишь рассказ.

178
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.141
Скажи это собаке

179
00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:49.144
[grunts]

180
00:08:49.179 --> 00:08:51.847
(продолжается плач)

181
00:08:56.653 --> 00:08:59.955
Слушай, Флэш, я понял

182
00:08:59.989 --> 00:09:01.690
У меня была собака, и она однажды скончалась

183
00:09:01.724 --> 00:09:03.459
Я потерял Скраппи.

184
00:09:03.493 --> 00:09:05.794
Ох, Скраппи.
Твоя собака вернулась?

185
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:07.563
Моя черепаха.

186
00:09:08.832 --> 00:09:10.966
Конечно. Смотри

187
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.235
Тебе нужно думать о том, как было бы чудесно

188
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:15.971
однажды выпустится и вернуться домой

189
00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:17.973
к Скраппи

190
00:09:18.007 --> 00:09:19.508
И он будет махать своим крошечным хвостиком

191
00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:23.111
и, надеюсь, потом не умрет

192
00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:26.915
Ты будешь дома достаточно скоро

193
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.851
Надеюсь ты прав

194
00:09:28.885 --> 00:09:31.153
в любом случае

195
00:09:31.187 --> 00:09:34.490
ты можешь помочь нам выпустится рассказав о чем эта книга

196
00:09:34.524 --> 00:09:36.091
чтобы мы завтра не провалили тест

197
00:09:39.028 --> 00:09:40.562
Мм...

198
00:09:46.236 --> 00:09:47.402
(кивок)

199
00:09:47.437 --> 00:09:49.571
Да

200
00:09:49.606 --> 00:09:52.107
(листает страницы)

201
00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:55.010
Ок

202
00:09:57.747 --> 00:09:59.281
(быстро говорит)

203
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.518
Конец

204
00:10:02.552 --> 00:10:05.020
Я ничего не понял

205
00:10:05.054 --> 00:10:09.424
извините. Я могу усваивать информацию моментально

206
00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:12.728
но и доносить ее также

207
00:10:12.762 --> 00:10:15.597
Но ты говорил о смерти собаки нормальным голосом

208
00:10:15.632 --> 00:10:18.433
Конечно, Подтверждаю

209
00:10:18.468 --> 00:10:22.104
Пребывание в башне познания мне помогло

210
00:10:22.138 --> 00:10:23.572
(СиДжей) Какой-то странный он

211
00:10:23.606 --> 00:10:25.707
Ага, он как один из этих странных существ

212
00:10:25.742 --> 00:10:27.543
Literature's always
talking about in class

213
00:10:27.577 --> 00:10:30.279
that a hero has to encounter
in order to learn something.

214
00:10:30.313 --> 00:10:32.381
Ага, только мы ничему не учимся.

215
00:10:32.415 --> 00:10:35.117
- Вообще-то это не так. Кое-что мы все же узнали
- Что?

216
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:37.719
То, что нам необязательно ходить к каким-то чувакам за помощью.

217
00:10:37.754 --> 00:10:40.255
если мы можем сами прочитать книгу,

218
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.259
как, кстати, я и собираюсь поступить

219
00:10:44.294 --> 00:10:47.029
Чего? Ты действительно хочешь прочитать эту книгу?

220
00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.730
Ага

221
00:10:48.765 --> 00:10:51.967
Чувак, перестань строить из себя героя

222
00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:55.871
I'm not trying to be a hero.
But we were given an assignment and failed to do it.

223
00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.840
Now we simply just have to
rise to the challenge.

224
00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:01.910
Yeah. That's pretty much
trying to be a hero.

225
00:11:01.945 --> 00:11:04.012
Come on. It's just going to take
a little effort.

226
00:11:04.047 --> 00:11:06.682
Угу. Титанические.

227
00:11:06.716 --> 00:11:10.252
[deep male voice]
"What a lamentable thing it is

228
00:11:10.286 --> 00:11:12.754
"that men should blame the gods

229
00:11:12.789 --> 00:11:16.058
"and regard us
as the source of their troubles,

230
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.293
"when it is
their own transgressions

231
00:11:18.328 --> 00:11:22.998
which bring them suffering
that was not their destiny."

232
00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:26.602
Wow. Who are you using
for Zeus' voice? It's perfect.

233
00:11:26.636 --> 00:11:30.238
My Uncle Orson.
He's the only person I know with a beard.

234
00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:33.008
Ок. Девочки, вы можете сосредоточится?

235
00:11:33.042 --> 00:11:35.677
I mean, they haven't even
introduced the main character yet.

236
00:11:35.712 --> 00:11:38.013
Итак, что с этим?

237
00:11:38.047 --> 00:11:41.350
I think Odysseus finally pops up
in the next chapter,

238
00:11:41.384 --> 00:11:43.852
and then tells all about
the adventures he's been on.

239
00:11:43.886 --> 00:11:47.623
- Guys, check this out.
- What have you been doing?

240
00:11:47.657 --> 00:11:50.092
I've been, uh...
[clears throat]

241
00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.761
- I've been reading.
- Reading.

242
00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:54.029
What's in the sack?

243
00:11:58.167 --> 00:11:59.635
Я тебе расскажу

244
00:12:01.204 --> 00:12:03.872
It could lead
to all yr deaths.

245
00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:06.441
Ох

246
00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:14.182
Okay? You can't just barge in here with
a ripped shirt and your sweaty face

247
00:12:14.217 --> 00:12:17.185
and say we might die if you tell us
but not tell us how we might die

248
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.187
if you end up telling us,
all right?

249
00:12:19.222 --> 00:12:20.756
-Расскажи нам
-Хорошо

250
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.691
Я расскажу вам всю историю

251
00:12:22.725 --> 00:12:25.093
I could actually use
your guys' help.

252
00:12:25.128 --> 00:12:27.095
Но один совет

253
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.864
You gotta promise
not to get involved.

254
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.034
That's what could
cause your deaths.

255
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.775
So it all began when I started
reading the book, right?

256
00:12:45.815 --> 00:12:48.884
It's gonna take ten years
to read this book.

257
00:12:48.918 --> 00:12:50.252
"Дом"

258
00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:51.720
[chuckles]

259
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.292
[chuckles]
Real insightful, dude.

260
00:12:59.562 --> 00:13:01.396
(кивает)

261
00:13:12.842 --> 00:13:15.110
"Sing in me, Muse,

262
00:13:15.144 --> 00:13:17.713
and through me tell the story
of that"--

263
00:13:17.747 --> 00:13:21.316
Ah, the notes about
who's talking in the story.

264
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.251
I get it.

265
00:13:26.289 --> 00:13:28.790
"Here meets supernatural
creatures--

266
00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:31.560
"i.e. Tower Prep students.

267
00:13:31.594 --> 00:13:34.262
"But which am I,
hero or weirdo?

268
00:13:34.297 --> 00:13:36.698
"Which are you?

269
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:40.268
[sighs]

270
00:13:40.303 --> 00:13:42.437
герой это Арчер

271
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.510
Что?

272
00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.482
And the notes in the margins--
they seemed like they were

273
00:13:53.516 --> 00:13:56.685
talking to me--
to me specifically.

274
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.988
Но

275
00:14:00.022 --> 00:14:02.424
how could someone write notes
directly to you

276
00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:04.526
in a book they'd have
no way of knowing

277
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.962
you'd be reading sometime
in the future?

278
00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:09.531
Maybe that's their ability--
knowing stuff like that.

279
00:14:09.565 --> 00:14:12.000
- I don't know.
- What are the notes saying?

280
00:14:21.244 --> 00:14:24.513
"Goddess Athena
guides Odysseus home.

281
00:14:24.547 --> 00:14:26.815
"What will guide you home?

282
00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:29.518
Эта книга?

283
00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:32.287
Используй эти заметки, чтобы сбежать из Башни познания

284
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:35.157
The note writer's trying to tell me
a way to escape from Tower Prep.

285
00:14:37.326 --> 00:14:39.327
Хорошо, но что с того?

286
00:14:39.362 --> 00:14:41.997
Это проблема

287
00:14:42.031 --> 00:14:43.999
The notes are vague,

288
00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:46.134
and some are in
some kind of code.

289
00:14:46.169 --> 00:14:49.638
They're hard to figure out.
But others are very specific.

290
00:14:49.672 --> 00:14:51.706
For example,
[clears throat]

291
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:53.909
"A hero must prove
himself worthy.

292
00:14:53.943 --> 00:14:56.912
Prove yourself worthy.
Use this book to find me."

293
00:14:56.946 --> 00:14:59.581
I figured if I listened to this one
note and found the guy that wrote it,

294
00:14:59.615 --> 00:15:02.083
he could at least explain some
stuff to me, you know?

295
00:15:02.118 --> 00:15:04.753
But how can you find him
if you don't know who he is?

296
00:15:04.787 --> 00:15:06.755
Or if he's even a guy.

297
00:15:06.789 --> 00:15:09.825
The goddess Athena guides
Odysseus on his adventures.

298
00:15:09.859 --> 00:15:13.528
These notes keep suggesting to
me to use this book as my guide.

299
00:15:13.563 --> 00:15:16.898
So I decided to track down everyone
on this list of previous readers

300
00:15:16.933 --> 00:15:18.600
to see if any of them
had written the notes.

301
00:15:18.634 --> 00:15:21.303
I ended up wandering
all over the dorms,

302
00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:24.906
and I met a bunch of strange,
mysterious creatures,

303
00:15:24.941 --> 00:15:28.877
otherwise known as
our fellow students.

304
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:31.346
[sniffing]

305
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:35.350
How...did you know I was about
to knock on your door?

306
00:15:35.384 --> 00:15:37.352
I could smell you
coming down the hall.

307
00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:38.753
Your deodorant reeks.

308
00:15:38.788 --> 00:15:40.322
It's odorless.

309
00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:42.524
I know. I could smell
the odorlessness.

310
00:15:42.558 --> 00:15:46.761
Um, I'm looking
for the person

311
00:15:46.796 --> 00:15:49.598
- who wrote the notes in this...
book.
- [sniffing]

312
00:15:49.632 --> 00:15:52.400
Are you Hubert Kovalev?

313
00:15:52.435 --> 00:15:53.969
[sniffing continues]

314
00:15:56.439 --> 00:16:00.008
Yeah, I am, but I never
cracked open that book, dude.

315
00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:03.545
I just listened to the Whisper audio
book version like everybody else does.

316
00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:06.448
Of course.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

317
00:16:06.482 --> 00:16:08.083
Smell you later.

318
00:16:11.487 --> 00:16:14.356
Now, some of these encounters
seemed like no big deal,

319
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.059
but others tried
to steer me off course.

320
00:16:20.162 --> 00:16:23.098
[wind whooshes]

321
00:16:23.132 --> 00:16:25.433

322
00:16:27.536 --> 00:16:32.073
Hey, are any of you girls
Tawny Dvorchek?

323
00:16:32.108 --> 00:16:35.577
If I wasn't before,

324
00:16:35.611 --> 00:16:37.178
I am now.

325
00:16:40.316 --> 00:16:42.450
You were assigned this book
in lit class.

326
00:16:42.485 --> 00:16:45.353
Did you write these notes?

327
00:16:48.457 --> 00:16:52.093
The only notes I write
are love notes.

328
00:16:52.128 --> 00:16:54.095
-Ох
-Сейчас я пишу

329
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.197

об истории поцелуев

331
00:16:59.702 --> 00:17:03.004
Do you wanna help me do
a little research for it?

332
00:17:03.039 --> 00:17:06.508
[stammering]

333
00:17:12.415 --> 00:17:16.084
[voices vocalizing]

334
00:17:18.721 --> 00:17:19.854
(смех)

335
00:17:19.889 --> 00:17:21.656
Who were these chicks again?

336
00:17:21.691 --> 00:17:24.192
- And what dorm were they in?
- [laughter]

337
00:17:24.226 --> 00:17:27.362
You've got to understand, I wanted
to keep looking for the note writer,

338
00:17:27.396 --> 00:17:30.298
but it was like I was under
some spell or something.

339
00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:32.901
I guess these girls can make
a guy do whatever they want.

340
00:17:32.935 --> 00:17:34.502
That's why
they're at this school.

341
00:17:34.537 --> 00:17:36.404
Every school
has girls like that.

342
00:17:36.439 --> 00:17:39.240
And it has nothing to do with
the fact that they're hot.

343
00:17:39.275 --> 00:17:41.476
- Mm-mm.
- I will admit, to some people,

344
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.012
they might be considered
not unattractive.

345
00:17:44.046 --> 00:17:46.848
- Oh.
- But that doesn't explain
why I went into their room.

346
00:17:46.882 --> 00:17:50.900
No, but that does explain why
your shirt's ripped shirt, tiger. Hmm?

347
00:17:51.662 --> 00:17:54.489
Like I said, Gabe,
I couldn't help myself.

348
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.330
(шепот)
Действительно

349
00:17:56.459 --> 00:17:59.494
[Women moaning]

350
00:17:59.528 --> 00:18:01.663
But I don't know anything
about the topic.

351
00:18:01.697 --> 00:18:05.500
That's okay. It only
needs to be 5,000 words.

352
00:18:05.534 --> 00:18:07.702
And even though
I hate writing essays,

353
00:18:07.737 --> 00:18:09.771
I felt like I wanted
to write this one forever

354
00:18:09.805 --> 00:18:11.873
and never leave
that room until...

355
00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.451
Gotta go.

356
00:18:23.486 --> 00:18:25.353
- [Women] Ohh!
- [door closes]

357
00:18:25.388 --> 00:18:28.089
Now what are we going to do?

358
00:18:28.124 --> 00:18:31.359
I guess we'll have to get
that dreamy Gabe Forrest

359
00:18:31.394 --> 00:18:33.194
to help us with our essay.

360
00:18:33.229 --> 00:18:35.797
[sighing, chuckling]

361
00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:39.367
Wow. She really said that?

362
00:18:39.402 --> 00:18:42.404
[sighs] No, they didn't.
I made that part up.

363
00:18:42.438 --> 00:18:44.873
But the book saved me
from who knows what.

364
00:18:44.907 --> 00:18:48.109
It convinced me that it was
guiding me down the right path.

365
00:18:48.144 --> 00:18:50.111
So I kept going down the list,

366
00:18:50.146 --> 00:18:52.113
which just caused me to meet
more and more

367
00:18:52.148 --> 00:18:54.115
of our bizarre students.

368
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.785
The last one was the worst.

369
00:18:56.819 --> 00:18:59.487
I barely made it out alive.

370
00:18:59.522 --> 00:19:01.823
(прочищает глотку)

371
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.628
What do you want?

372
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.202
Get a life.

373
00:19:16.038 --> 00:19:18.573
Have you ever seen
a girl like that before?

374
00:19:18.607 --> 00:19:21.009
I mean, it was terrifying.

375
00:19:21.043 --> 00:19:24.412
Bro, it's okay.
You're safe now.

376
00:19:24.447 --> 00:19:26.414
So you never found
the note writer.

377
00:19:26.449 --> 00:19:28.683
He wasn't any of the names
on the list.

378
00:19:28.717 --> 00:19:31.019
So I had to search through the book
for some other clue to follow.

379
00:19:31.053 --> 00:19:34.089
That was when I noticed there
were three dog-eared pages.

380
00:19:34.123 --> 00:19:36.524
Page 14, folded to the left,

381
00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:39.594
and page 23 to the right,

382
00:19:39.628 --> 00:19:42.097
and then page 36,

383
00:19:42.131 --> 00:19:45.667
suggesting to me
a combination lock number.

384
00:19:45.701 --> 00:19:48.736
Where's the only place on campus
with combination locks?

385
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.345
- [Boy] All of you, on my shoulders.
- [girls laughing]

386
00:19:57.379 --> 00:19:59.547
Hey, great job, girls.
See you at practice tomorrow.

387
00:19:59.582 --> 00:20:02.550
- [Girls] Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
- [chuckles]

388
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.725
- <i>[feedback]</i>
- Hey, dude.

389
00:20:10.759 --> 00:20:12.560
What's the deal?
That's my locker.

390
00:20:12.595 --> 00:20:14.863
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

391
00:20:14.897 --> 00:20:17.632
I was just looking for something important
that I thought might be in there.

392
00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:19.667
Think again.

393
00:20:19.702 --> 00:20:22.070
Hey, look, I said I'm sorry,
all right?

394
00:20:22.104 --> 00:20:23.972
You don't have to be
a jerk about it.

395
00:20:24.006 --> 00:20:26.374
Look, I just went through a real
grueling cheer practice, okay?

396
00:20:26.408 --> 00:20:27.809
I'm a little too tired
to be polite.

397
00:20:27.843 --> 00:20:29.811
Cheer practice?

398
00:20:29.845 --> 00:20:32.480
We're in a secret school in
the middle of who-knows-where.

399
00:20:32.515 --> 00:20:37.152
I mean, why even bother having
a cheer squad or a mascot?

400
00:20:37.186 --> 00:20:39.721
- What's our rival school anyway?
- [growls, snorts]

401
00:20:39.755 --> 00:20:42.924
If you have a problem with school
spirit, I got a problem with you.

402
00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:44.826
[chuckles]
No, buddy. I think

403
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.729
your only problem is that you
like dressing up like a cow.

404
00:20:47.763 --> 00:20:49.063
I'm a bull!

405
00:20:52.468 --> 00:20:54.335
[groans]

406
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.738
[growling]

407
00:20:56.772 --> 00:21:00.241
You know, maybe reading all this
Greek mythological stuff

408
00:21:00.276 --> 00:21:03.344
is, you know,
starting to get to you.

409
00:21:03.379 --> 00:21:05.613
What makes you say that?

410
00:21:05.648 --> 00:21:09.284
No reason.
You know what? Continue.

411
00:21:09.318 --> 00:21:12.520
Okay. It was whilst
I was engaged

412
00:21:12.555 --> 00:21:14.088
in epic battle with
the monstrous Minotaur

413
00:21:14.123 --> 00:21:16.624
that the Fates showed me
an error in my calculations.

414
00:21:16.659 --> 00:21:18.660
[Mascot laughing]

415
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.598
How does that feel?
Had enough?

416
00:21:23.632 --> 00:21:25.967
(продолжая смеяться)
16

417
00:21:27.069 --> 00:21:28.036
[groans]

418
00:21:30.105 --> 00:21:31.506
[Mascot groaning]

419
00:21:32.908 --> 00:21:34.309
Я ничего не вижу, ничего!

420
00:21:34.343 --> 00:21:36.578
Но..сейчас я могу слышать

421
00:21:39.114 --> 00:21:40.815
[Mascot groans]

422
00:22:07.376 --> 00:22:08.496
What was in the locker?

423
00:22:08.993 --> 00:22:11.094
- Tell us.
- What was it?
- [mutters]

424
00:22:12.596 --> 00:22:13.863
[sighs]

425
00:22:20.704 --> 00:22:22.705
[Ian]
A Cyclops skull.

426
00:22:31.882 --> 00:22:33.850
это не может быть реальностью

427
00:22:33.884 --> 00:22:36.453
не можешь?

428
00:22:36.487 --> 00:22:40.123
There's no such thing
as as Cyclops.

429
00:22:40.157 --> 00:22:42.525
How could someone keep a skull
in their gym locker?

430
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.128
Because the note writer knew that
I would eventually find it there.

431
00:22:45.162 --> 00:22:48.031
He's trying to tell me that I'm
on the right path to finding him,

432
00:22:48.065 --> 00:22:51.968
and a way to escape, but I don't
know where to go from here.

433
00:22:52.002 --> 00:22:54.370
Was there anything else
in the locker?

434
00:22:54.405 --> 00:22:56.840
Just his gym clothes.

435
00:22:56.874 --> 00:23:00.276
- [insects buzzing]
- [gasping, coughing]

436
00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:04.147
Come on, man.
This is worse than the Cyclops skull.

437
00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:06.349
Maybe he wrote his name on them.

438
00:23:06.383 --> 00:23:07.784
- [clears throat]
- [groans]

439
00:23:11.155 --> 00:23:12.889
"No man"?

440
00:23:12.923 --> 00:23:15.024
It's just a reference
to the book.

441
00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:18.561
Odysseus tricks the Cyclops by
telling him his name is No Man,

442
00:23:18.596 --> 00:23:21.131
so when he pokes his eye out,
the Cyclops starts screaming,

443
00:23:21.165 --> 00:23:22.699
"No Man is attacking me,"

444
00:23:22.733 --> 00:23:25.001
and all the other Cyclops
think he's crazy.

445
00:23:25.035 --> 00:23:27.971
Sounds like a pretty good scene.

446
00:23:28.005 --> 00:23:30.406
It's got a Cyclops in it.
How could it be bad?

447
00:23:30.441 --> 00:23:32.675
эй, а что если Сиджей

448
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.011
использует свою силу при чтении этих записок?

449
00:23:35.045 --> 00:23:37.747
может быть она узнает, что нам сможет пригодится

450
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:39.482
нет

451
00:23:39.517 --> 00:23:41.751
No. You guys cannot
help me on this.

452
00:23:41.785 --> 00:23:45.655
- I have to do it alone.
- What are you talking about?

453
00:23:45.689 --> 00:23:49.859
This is why I didn't want
to tell you guys this stuff.

454
00:23:49.894 --> 00:23:54.230
Все члены команды Одиссея погибли

455
00:23:54.265 --> 00:23:57.500
Ужасной смертью. 
Только герой выжил

456
00:23:57.535 --> 00:23:59.769
Герой должен пройти этот путь в одиночку

457
00:23:59.803 --> 00:24:03.673
You really think if we try to
help you, we're all gonna die?

458
00:24:03.707 --> 00:24:05.575
That's what the notes
are warning.

459
00:24:05.609 --> 00:24:09.712
Ian, we're in this together.

460
00:24:09.747 --> 00:24:13.082
If you're right, and these notes can
lead us to finding a way to escape,

461
00:24:13.117 --> 00:24:16.119
then even if it does
get dangerous somehow,

462
00:24:16.153 --> 00:24:17.921
we're all going to help
any way we can.

463
00:24:17.955 --> 00:24:20.190
Whoa, Ceej. No offense,

464
00:24:20.224 --> 00:24:22.192
but whatever happened
to voting?

465
00:24:23.727 --> 00:24:25.094
все в порядке

466
00:24:29.133 --> 00:24:30.867
это интересно

467
00:24:30.901 --> 00:24:34.704
He's incredibly smart
and has a very heroic nature,

468
00:24:34.738 --> 00:24:39.209
but he doesn't think he's smart
or heroic enough.

469
00:24:39.243 --> 00:24:41.544
But he thinks you, Ian,
might be.

470
00:24:41.579 --> 00:24:44.981
He wrote these notes
the way he did to test you.

471
00:24:45.015 --> 00:24:48.818
Finding the Cyclops skull means
you've passed that trial.

472
00:24:48.852 --> 00:24:51.588
But now you have to
retrace your journey

473
00:24:51.622 --> 00:24:53.823
in order to go forward
and find him

474
00:24:53.857 --> 00:24:55.825
You got all that just from
analyzing his writing?

475
00:24:55.859 --> 00:24:59.462
Plus, that's exactly what
he's written on this page.

476
00:24:59.496 --> 00:25:01.564
[chuckles]

477
00:25:01.599 --> 00:25:03.333
Oh.
[chuckles]

478
00:25:03.367 --> 00:25:05.702
I haven't gotten that far
in the book yet.

479
00:25:09.506 --> 00:25:12.075
"Retrace your journey
in order to find him."

480
00:25:12.109 --> 00:25:13.943
What does that mean?

481
00:25:13.978 --> 00:25:15.778
How is going back over
your steps

482
00:25:15.813 --> 00:25:17.580
supposed to help you
track this guy down?

483
00:25:17.615 --> 00:25:21.417
Unless I'm not suppose
to track him down myself,

484
00:25:21.452 --> 00:25:23.987
but I'm supposed to use someone

485
00:25:24.021 --> 00:25:27.824
I met while following the notes.

486
00:25:27.858 --> 00:25:32.128
- [sniffs]
What's that stench?
- Hey. It's me again.

487
00:25:32.162 --> 00:25:35.932
I was wondering, your nose-- can
you use it to track people down?

488
00:25:35.966 --> 00:25:38.268
You mean like a bloodhound?

489
00:25:38.302 --> 00:25:40.103
See, we're looking
for this person,

490
00:25:40.137 --> 00:25:42.305
and we don't know who they are
or where they are.

491
00:25:42.339 --> 00:25:44.440
All we've got to go on
is their gym clothes.

492
00:25:44.475 --> 00:25:46.609
So let me get this straight.
First, you want me

493
00:25:46.644 --> 00:25:49.178
to smell someone's gym shorts,

494
00:25:49.213 --> 00:25:51.481
then you want me to run around
like a trained dog?

495
00:25:52.816 --> 00:25:54.951
Dude, you're barking up
the wrong tree.

496
00:26:03.661 --> 00:26:05.428
[sniffing]

497
00:26:07.665 --> 00:26:09.699
[sniffing continues]

498
00:26:18.776 --> 00:26:19.809
[insects buzzing]

499
00:26:19.843 --> 00:26:21.577
Фетч

500
00:26:21.612 --> 00:26:23.579
[sniffing]

501
00:26:29.787 --> 00:26:34.357
What are you guys doing out?
It's past curfew.

502
00:26:34.391 --> 00:26:37.493
You're all supposed to be
in your rooms.

503
00:26:39.963 --> 00:26:42.365
[chuckles]
Gabe.

504
00:26:44.535 --> 00:26:46.769
[clears throat]

505
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.211
Пропусти нас

506
00:27:04.788 --> 00:27:06.589
Хм, извините меня

507
00:27:06.623 --> 00:27:09.726
Я только что сказал тебе

508
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.627
Пропустить нас

509
00:27:11.662 --> 00:27:15.098
А я сказал, что сейчас комендантский час

510
00:27:15.132 --> 00:27:17.100
[Gabe chuckles]
I don't think you understand.

511
00:27:17.134 --> 00:27:20.103
I can pretty much make you
do anything I want.

512
00:27:20.137 --> 00:27:23.940
No, you don't understand.
What you do has no effect on me.

513
00:27:23.974 --> 00:27:27.143
Nobody can make me do anything
I don't want to.

514
00:27:27.177 --> 00:27:29.612
[clears throat]
Right.

515
00:27:29.646 --> 00:27:31.748
Just one second, please.

516
00:27:33.183 --> 00:27:35.785
Hey, guys, have met
my new arch-nemesis?

517
00:27:35.819 --> 00:27:38.321
Sorry, dude.
We were getting close, too.

518
00:27:38.355 --> 00:27:40.923
Oh, no. Don't you worry.
We're not done with you yet.

519
00:27:40.958 --> 00:27:43.726
You're not the only person I've
met recently who can help me.

520
00:27:45.162 --> 00:27:48.464
[Women moaning]

521
00:27:57.274 --> 00:28:00.810
Excuse me. It's past curfew.
You ladies are gonna have to--

522
00:28:00.844 --> 00:28:03.546
Shh!

523
00:28:06.216 --> 00:28:08.351
[moaning continues]

524
00:28:19.963 --> 00:28:22.465
Спасибо, буду должен

525
00:28:22.499 --> 00:28:24.534
You owe me a couple.

526
00:28:26.036 --> 00:28:28.171
[moaning continues]

527
00:28:30.674 --> 00:28:33.443
I don't get it.
How come their hyper-suasion works on him

528
00:28:33.477 --> 00:28:35.144
but mine doesn't?

529
00:28:35.179 --> 00:28:37.113
I'm not sure they're
even using hyper-suasion.

530
00:28:37.147 --> 00:28:39.649
- [snaps fingers]
- [clears throat]

531
00:28:39.683 --> 00:28:41.617
- [whistles]
- [sniffing]

532
00:28:45.522 --> 00:28:47.523
[sniffing continues]

533
00:29:01.905 --> 00:29:04.841
Here.
This is where it leads.

534
00:29:04.875 --> 00:29:07.143
Oh, no.

535
00:29:07.177 --> 00:29:09.479
- Dude, this is the girl's room.
- What girl's room?

536
00:29:09.513 --> 00:29:12.114
The one with the face
and the crazy hair.

537
00:29:13.851 --> 00:29:15.818
My job's done.
I gotta go.

538
00:29:15.853 --> 00:29:18.154
- What?
- What's wrong?

539
00:29:19.256 --> 00:29:21.824
I can smell fear.

540
00:29:21.859 --> 00:29:23.926
О, отлично

541
00:29:23.961 --> 00:29:27.063
He can smell fear.
Did you hear that?

542
00:29:27.097 --> 00:29:29.432
This is how
the rest of the crew dies, okay?

543
00:29:29.466 --> 00:29:31.400
Can we please save ourselves?
What are you doing?

544
00:29:32.603 --> 00:29:33.870
[panting]

545
00:29:47.551 --> 00:29:50.720
What are you doing
with Norman's gym clothes?

546
00:29:50.754 --> 00:29:52.855
[insects buzzing]

547
00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:55.591
So, you know the person
these belong to?

548
00:29:55.626 --> 00:29:58.194
Yeah, but where is he?

549
00:29:58.228 --> 00:30:00.062
Он выжил?

550
00:30:02.065 --> 00:30:04.066
Ох...

551
00:30:07.414 --> 00:30:11.017
Yeah, this is my book
for a class a couple terms ago,

552
00:30:11.051 --> 00:30:12.618
но я никогда не читал об этом

553
00:30:12.653 --> 00:30:14.954
I didn't have to.
Norman read it for me.

554
00:30:14.988 --> 00:30:17.824
He became obsessed with it
before he disappeared.

555
00:30:17.858 --> 00:30:20.026
He found some sort of
weird parallel

556
00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.628
between the hero's journey
and attending this school.

557
00:30:22.663 --> 00:30:26.065
Yeah, I know. I've been reading
his notes in the book.

558
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:30.336
I gotta say, it's been kind of hard
figuring out what he means, though.

559
00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:34.073
Norman had a weird way
of telling people things.

560
00:30:34.108 --> 00:30:36.909
I sort of hoped he had
sent you here as a message

561
00:30:36.944 --> 00:30:39.045
to let me know he's okay.

562
00:30:39.079 --> 00:30:41.247
How could he have known
I'd be assigned that book?

563
00:30:41.281 --> 00:30:45.218
Norman just...knew things

564
00:30:45.252 --> 00:30:47.487
before they were ever
explained to him,

565
00:30:47.521 --> 00:30:49.689
before they even happened.

566
00:30:49.723 --> 00:30:51.691
He sensed, the whole time
we were together,

567
00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:53.993
that we were destined
to be apart.

568
00:30:54.027 --> 00:30:56.562
And not in some
relationshipy type of way.

569
00:30:56.597 --> 00:31:00.533
He just-- He knew
he'd have to go, and we'd...

570
00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:02.568
It's kind of hard to explain.

571
00:31:02.603 --> 00:31:05.037
It's like falling in love
with a vampire.

572
00:31:05.072 --> 00:31:07.373
You girls get it.

573
00:31:07.407 --> 00:31:11.410
But knowing things-- That's
why Norman was brought here.

574
00:31:11.445 --> 00:31:14.180
But that's what drove him crazy.

575
00:31:14.214 --> 00:31:16.349
Tower Prep was the one thing
that he couldn't know.

576
00:31:16.383 --> 00:31:18.684
Every question that
he answered about this school

577
00:31:18.719 --> 00:31:20.953
only led to more questions.

578
00:31:20.988 --> 00:31:23.623
Yeah. I know how that feels.

579
00:31:23.657 --> 00:31:26.058
But if he's trying to point you
in some direction,

580
00:31:26.093 --> 00:31:28.127
maybe he thinks you'll find
the answers that he couldn't.

581
00:31:28.162 --> 00:31:31.197
Find answers?
I can't even find him.

582
00:31:31.231 --> 00:31:35.334
Well, if he guided you here,
there's a reason for it.

583
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.272
Do you have anything of his?

584
00:31:39.306 --> 00:31:42.141
You know, maybe, like, a picture
of him or something?

585
00:31:43.977 --> 00:31:47.847
He took the only picture I had of
him just before he disappeared.

586
00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.154
можно я?

587
00:32:01.595 --> 00:32:04.063
- What are you doing?
- I think there's something here.

588
00:32:12.039 --> 00:32:14.040
This is what
he wanted me to have.

589
00:32:16.276 --> 00:32:20.313
He wanted you to have this?
I mean, how could you possibly know that?

590
00:32:20.347 --> 00:32:22.548
I just know.

591
00:32:23.617 --> 00:32:25.117
ты мне напоминаешь его

592
00:32:29.556 --> 00:32:34.393
Do you have any idea why he
would've wanted me to find this?

593
00:32:37.798 --> 00:32:39.765
Because it'll lead you to him.

594
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:46.138
When you find him,
tell him I....

595
00:32:46.173 --> 00:32:47.673
Не бери в голову

596
00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:51.310
Не говори ему ничего

597
00:32:51.345 --> 00:32:53.646
He'd already know
anything I'd say.

598
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:03.289
Wow. In real life,

599
00:33:03.323 --> 00:33:07.693
doomed romanticism
is actually quite depressing.

600
00:33:07.728 --> 00:33:11.664
Depressing?
You know what's depressing?

601
00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:15.234
Is that we're not any closer
to finding Norman.

602
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:18.070
Oh, yeah.
And a way out of here.

603
00:33:18.105 --> 00:33:21.340
Should I even bother to point out
that we're also not any closer

604
00:33:21.375 --> 00:33:24.810
to finishing the book
for the test tomorrow?

605
00:33:24.845 --> 00:33:26.812
I didn't think so.

606
00:33:26.847 --> 00:33:30.816
You know, I'm really starting
to hate this Norman guy.

607
00:33:30.851 --> 00:33:32.652
I give up.

608
00:33:41.228 --> 00:33:44.230
This is the same size
as the compass.

609
00:33:48.969 --> 00:33:51.704
Hmm. The odyssey ends here,

610
00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:54.407
which, on our map...

611
00:33:59.379 --> 00:34:02.348
The secret he wants us to find
is out here in the woods,

612
00:34:02.382 --> 00:34:04.784
near the perimeter wall.

613
00:34:04.818 --> 00:34:06.886
There's probably gnomes
out there this time of night.

614
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.888
Yeah. That's fine.

615
00:34:08.922 --> 00:34:10.690
I'll leave first thing
in the morning.

616
00:34:10.724 --> 00:34:12.525
Where should we meet?

617
00:34:12.559 --> 00:34:15.594
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.
I'm going out there alone.

618
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:18.464
I've ignored the warnings of
crew members dying long enough.

619
00:34:18.498 --> 00:34:19.799
You guys are staying here.

620
00:34:19.833 --> 00:34:23.803
Охх..

621
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.648
Oh...

622
00:34:35.682 --> 00:34:37.817
[Gabe]
Um, Ian, a quicky real quick,

623
00:34:37.851 --> 00:34:39.819
just in case it's on the test,

624
00:34:39.853 --> 00:34:42.455
how do the rest of the crew
end up dying?

625
00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.457
- In the book?
- Yes.

626
00:34:44.491 --> 00:34:47.093
- Uh, well, most drowned, actually.
- Oh, drowned.

627
00:34:47.127 --> 00:34:50.830
Yeah. Some got smashed by boulders
thrown at them by giants.

628
00:34:50.864 --> 00:34:53.566
Some get eaten by Scylla,
a six-headed monster.

629
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.934
- [Suki] Ew.
- [Gabe chuckling] Monsters.

630
00:34:54.968 --> 00:34:56.635
One guy forgot
that he fell asleep

631
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.270
on top of a house.

632
00:34:58.305 --> 00:34:59.939
When he wakes up,
he falls off the roof

633
00:34:59.973 --> 00:35:01.941
and, uh, breaks his neck.

634
00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:05.411
Oh! The classic slapstick death.
Nice.

635
00:35:05.445 --> 00:35:07.613
Why do I feel
like I have that coming?

636
00:35:07.647 --> 00:35:09.782
Gabe, we're not going to die.

637
00:35:09.816 --> 00:35:11.784
Oh, of course not.
Not now anyway.

638
00:35:11.818 --> 00:35:14.120
How much farther do we have?

639
00:35:16.189 --> 00:35:19.592
Whatever we're suppose to find
should be straight ahead.

640
00:35:19.626 --> 00:35:22.762
[Suki]
Wouldn't it be great
if what we end up finding

641
00:35:22.796 --> 00:35:26.098
is a copy of the test
with an answer key?

642
00:35:26.133 --> 00:35:28.934
[Ian]
Well, you know where Odysseus
had to go to find his answers.

643
00:35:28.969 --> 00:35:30.936
Where does he have to go?

644
00:35:30.971 --> 00:35:34.206
Hades, the ancient
Greek land of the dead.

645
00:35:34.241 --> 00:35:36.842
He has to travel to the underworld
and talk to a dead prophet

646
00:35:36.877 --> 00:35:40.279
to find out what he has to do
to get home.

647
00:35:40.313 --> 00:35:43.582
Oh, that must've been back
before they had GPS.

648
00:35:47.921 --> 00:35:50.122
Looks like we found
the Land of the Dead.

649
00:35:55.195 --> 00:35:57.196
I really, really hope

650
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.832
that this is not last year's
graduating class.

651
00:36:03.336 --> 00:36:07.840
They're definitely gravestones,
but what's with the crazy name?

652
00:36:07.874 --> 00:36:10.242
(читает)

653
00:36:10.277 --> 00:36:12.178
Это латиница

654
00:36:12.212 --> 00:36:15.147
Some sort of
biological classification.

655
00:36:15.182 --> 00:36:17.983
So this is the escape route
Norman wanted you to find?

656
00:36:18.018 --> 00:36:20.586
It's a dead end, literally.
I...

657
00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.855
Who do you think is buried here?

658
00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:24.990
I hope it's not Norman himself.

659
00:36:25.025 --> 00:36:27.526
Maybe he was worried he might
end up out here,

660
00:36:27.561 --> 00:36:29.695
so he left me clues
in case he did.

661
00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:31.397
But why would he
be buried out here?

662
00:36:31.431 --> 00:36:33.032
Maybe it's where
they bury the children

663
00:36:33.066 --> 00:36:35.401
who try to escape the school,
okay?

664
00:36:35.435 --> 00:36:38.037
Now can we leave, please?
Huh? Come on.

665
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:39.205
[cries out]

666
00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:41.440
- [screams]
- [thuds]

667
00:36:43.443 --> 00:36:44.710
- Гейб!

668
00:36:44.744 --> 00:36:47.279
- [Ian] You all right?
- Yeah.

669
00:36:47.314 --> 00:36:52.084
My glasses broke my fall.
Jeez.

670
00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:54.120
- Come on, come on.
Give us your arm.
- Come here.

671
00:36:54.154 --> 00:36:55.855
Don't fall.

672
00:36:55.889 --> 00:36:57.356
It's so cold down there.

673
00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.593
- [Gabe panting]
- Are you okay?

674
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.267
[sighs]

675
00:37:14.608 --> 00:37:17.143
I'm suddenly over my thing
for vampires.

676
00:37:17.177 --> 00:37:20.446
[grunting]
Come on.

677
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.780
[gasps]

678
00:37:24.784 --> 00:37:27.753
The rest of
the Cyclops skeleton.

679
00:37:27.787 --> 00:37:30.823
Do you think each of these graves has
a different monster in them?

680
00:37:30.857 --> 00:37:32.825
But why bury them
and give them headstones?

681
00:37:32.859 --> 00:37:35.427
I mean, that's like something
you do for a pet.

682
00:37:42.469 --> 00:37:44.036
What are you doing?

683
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:52.111
It's a tunnel.

684
00:37:52.145 --> 00:37:53.479
Guys,

685
00:37:55.348 --> 00:37:57.349
this is our way out.

686
00:38:04.919 --> 00:38:06.853
I knew Norman wouldn't let me down.

687
00:38:06.887 --> 00:38:08.988
How do you know it goes
all the way down the wall?

688
00:38:11.158 --> 00:38:13.459
Гейб, книгу пожалуйста

689
00:38:13.494 --> 00:38:15.461
Он показал мне

690
00:38:18.199 --> 00:38:19.632
Смотрите

691
00:38:24.805 --> 00:38:28.441
I just didn't understand what he
was trying to tell me at the time.

692
00:38:28.475 --> 00:38:31.844
But all this stuff with
the Cyclops and the graveyard--

693
00:38:31.879 --> 00:38:33.680
What's it all mean?

694
00:38:33.714 --> 00:38:36.015
Apparently even Norman
couldn't figure it out.

695
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:39.385
This must have been
why he decided to leave.

696
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.521
Frankly, I'm with Norman.

697
00:38:41.555 --> 00:38:45.258
Guys, who cares about what--
what all of this is, okay?

698
00:38:45.292 --> 00:38:47.660
We don't need to know what
Tower Prep's all about now.

699
00:38:47.695 --> 00:38:50.129
We can-- We can go.
We can leave all this behind.

700
00:38:50.164 --> 00:38:52.599
Нет

701
00:38:52.633 --> 00:38:54.367
I can't ignore
these warnings anymore.

702
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:57.503
- Не один из вас не пройдет
- Что?

703
00:38:57.538 --> 00:39:00.707
I don't want any of my crew to
die, let alone all of them.

704
00:39:00.741 --> 00:39:02.875
This tunnel looks like it
could collapse at any second.

705
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.644
Then maybe you shouldn't
go either.

706
00:39:05.679 --> 00:39:10.149
Сидж, я должен

707
00:39:12.786 --> 00:39:15.888
I'd give you a hug good-bye,

708
00:39:15.923 --> 00:39:19.993
but you're in a grave with
a headless Cyclops skeleton.

709
00:39:20.027 --> 00:39:23.730
[chuckles] Looks like I won't
be needing this anymore.

710
00:39:25.232 --> 00:39:27.667
I never did finish it.

711
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.237
Хмм

712
00:39:31.272 --> 00:39:33.206
Ты этого не знаешь?

713
00:39:34.341 --> 00:39:36.943
Последней страницы нет

714
00:39:37.945 --> 00:39:40.647
Я предполагаю, это путешествие никогда не закончится

715
00:39:42.016 --> 00:39:44.250
Я вернусь к вам ребята

716
00:39:44.285 --> 00:39:46.753
Скорее, чем вы думаете

717
00:39:53.727 --> 00:39:57.397
[grunting]

718
00:40:07.641 --> 00:40:10.576
Ян, что случилось?

719
00:40:12.546 --> 00:40:14.547
Здесь что-то внизу!

720
00:40:14.581 --> 00:40:16.549
[sighs]

721
00:40:21.288 --> 00:40:24.691
[grunts] It's collapsing!
Get me outta here!

722
00:40:24.725 --> 00:40:27.593
Гейб!

723
00:40:27.628 --> 00:40:28.928
[gasps]

724
00:40:32.766 --> 00:40:34.467
Следи за тылом

725
00:40:36.603 --> 00:40:38.071
Помоги мне!

726
00:40:39.673 --> 00:40:41.441
- Быстрее!
- Ян!

727
00:40:43.444 --> 00:40:44.977
- Oh!
- [panting]

728
00:40:45.012 --> 00:40:46.879
- Все хорошо?
- Да, я в порядке

729
00:40:46.914 --> 00:40:48.915
[panting continues]

730
00:40:48.949 --> 00:40:50.650
Unreal.

731
00:40:50.684 --> 00:40:52.485
[sighs]

732
00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:56.155
- Oh.
- What's that?

733
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.991
Это же последняя страница книги

734
00:41:00.561 --> 00:41:02.895
It says, "My journey
is not your journey.

735
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.164
Your odyssey
is not <i>the</i> odyssey."

736
00:41:05.199 --> 00:41:08.434
That's good.
Now he tells you.

737
00:41:08.469 --> 00:41:10.937
"Sorry about that last trial,

738
00:41:10.971 --> 00:41:13.840
"but I had to make sure
you were hero material.

739
00:41:13.874 --> 00:41:17.110
"Now I know you're the man to solve
the school mysteries I couldn't.

740
00:41:17.144 --> 00:41:20.780
P.S., please give this
to my first mate."

741
00:41:24.551 --> 00:41:25.918
[chuckles]

742
00:41:25.953 --> 00:41:27.353
Что это?

743
00:41:27.388 --> 00:41:30.423
Это картинка Нормана

744
00:41:30.457 --> 00:41:32.592
- Let me see.
- Not quite what I expected.

745
00:41:35.596 --> 00:41:38.398
w. To think you put your life
in this guy's hands.

746
00:41:38.432 --> 00:41:40.566
Тут. Дайте мне посмотреть

747
00:41:42.002 --> 00:41:44.103
I guess Norman wasn't leading us
out of here after all.

748
00:41:44.138 --> 00:41:47.907
What? Now what do we do?

749
00:41:47.941 --> 00:41:49.575
[Ian]
Now I guess

750
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.210
the only thing left to do

751
00:41:51.245 --> 00:41:54.714
is be late for class.

752
00:42:02.956 --> 00:42:05.224
Ah, Mr. Archer
and his merry crew.

753
00:42:05.259 --> 00:42:07.059
Time is almost up.

754
00:42:07.094 --> 00:42:08.494
We'd like to take the test, sir.

755
00:42:08.529 --> 00:42:10.062
Did you even read the book?

756
00:42:10.097 --> 00:42:12.331
Прочитал?

757
00:42:12.366 --> 00:42:14.500
Я жил ей

758
00:42:27.014 --> 00:42:28.781
Спасибо, сэр

759
00:42:43.664 --> 00:42:46.699
<i>760
00:42:57.211 --> 00:43:00.947
Well, I didn't get an A, but I
knew enough to fake passing it.

761
00:43:00.981 --> 00:43:02.782
Hey, what was the name
of the dog?

762
00:43:02.816 --> 00:43:04.350
- Argus.
- Oh!

763
00:43:04.384 --> 00:43:05.985
- Oh!
- I wrote "Scooby."

764
00:43:06.019 --> 00:43:08.221
- [chuckling]
- How'd you do, Ian?

765
00:43:08.255 --> 00:43:11.357
Well, I'm not sure
how I did on the test,

766
00:43:11.391 --> 00:43:14.460
but I think I figured out what Norman was
trying to tell me with his last note.

767
00:43:14.495 --> 00:43:18.130
See, my odyssey is not the same
as the odyssey in this book.

768
00:43:18.165 --> 00:43:20.333
It's not about trying to find
a way back home.

769
00:43:20.367 --> 00:43:22.535
My odyssey is here
at Tower Prep,

770
00:43:22.569 --> 00:43:26.339
and trying to figure out what's really
going on at this psycho school.

771
00:43:26.373 --> 00:43:27.573
[chuckles]

772
00:43:35.616 --> 00:43:38.384
Hey, uh,

773
00:43:38.418 --> 00:43:40.753
Norman wanted you to have this.

774
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:46.225
He's, uh, not quite
what I expected.

775
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.027
[chuckles]

776
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.765
He didn't want you
to know where he was going,

777
00:43:52.799 --> 00:43:54.834
because he was afraid
if you went,

778
00:43:54.868 --> 00:43:56.869
you might get hurt or even--

779
00:43:56.904 --> 00:43:59.939
I know.
I know all that now.

780
00:44:05.445 --> 00:44:08.981
You're gonna find out
the things that Norman couldn't.

781
00:44:09.016 --> 00:44:11.417
Be careful.

782
00:44:11.451 --> 00:44:15.655
<i>783
00:44:15.689 --> 00:44:18.324
