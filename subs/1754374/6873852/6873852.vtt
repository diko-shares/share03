1
00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.975
Hey, Wayne, do you think this is
some sort of drill or something?

2
00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:18.227
Beats me, partner.

3
00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.270
She said to meet her here immediately.

4
00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:21.438
-You're late.
-(BOTH EXCLAIM)

5
00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.565
Lanny. Wayne.

6
00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.318
Uh, roasting chestnuts, Magee!
What's the deal here?

7
00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:27.819
I know as much as you do.

8
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.031
Clearly a "Silent Night" operation.

9
00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:34.493
-Your contact is waiting in there.
-(BELL TINKLING)

10
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.205
Good luck.

11
00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:41.250
And if something happens to you,
I just wanted to say

12
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.876
I'm claiming your snowmobile.

13
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.087
-I cancelled the insurance.
-Okay, bye!

14
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.464
LANNY: (WHISPERING) What does
she mean "If something happens?"

15
00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.842
-And who's this contact?
-Come on, it's the Big Guy's sleigh,

16
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.510
it could only be one person.

17
00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.929
BOTH: (GASPING) Mrs. Claus!

18
00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.347
(SHUSHING)

19
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.099
MRS. CLAUS:
(SOFTLY) Keep your voices down.

20
00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.184
Would you boys
like some hot chocolate?

21
00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:02.896
I'm not sure if
it's appropriate for a secret meeting,

22
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.480
(CHUCKLES) but, what the heck.

23
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.317
Anything for you
Prep and Landing elves.

24
00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.112
Aren't you the stealthy ones?

25
00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.738
Yup, that's us.

26
00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:15.325
Oh, good. Because I have
an important mission for you.

27
00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.288
I need your special skills
in retrieving this item.

28
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.791
-A wooden box?
-It's tucked away in a secure location.

29
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.128
-Inside Santa's office.
-(STARTLED GRUNT)

30
00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:31.091
Of course, he practically lives there,
he's so busy this time of year.

31
00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:34.595
But he does take his daily nap
just before 3:00.

32
00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:38.765
I've recorded some more details
on this little doohickey here.

33
00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:41.810
Don't let me down, boys.

34
00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:44.771
LANNY: This is a bad idea, Wayne!

35
00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:48.066
Sneaking into Santa's office?
While he's sleeping?

36
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.236
We're going on the
Naughty List for sure!

37
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.697
-What's this?
-My hat.

38
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.116
And what are you doing right now?

39
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.951
Um... Worrying?

40
00:01:58.035 --> 00:02:01.079
And what do we do when we worry?

41
00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.291
Put it in the hat?

42
00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.417
Very good.

43
00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:07.586
(BEEPING)

44
00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.341
Stay in the hat. Stay in the hat.
Stay in the hat.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:41.286

47
00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.289
(GASPS)

48
00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:48.502
Lanny? Wayne?

49
00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:49.711
What do you think...

50
00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:52.714
-You two are going on the Naughty List!
-(SIGHS)

51
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.550
You get coal!

52
00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.594
Ho! Ho! Go!

53
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.221
(SHIVERS)

54
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.391
WAYNE: (WHISPERING)
Lanny. Hey, hey, hey, Lanny.

55
00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.102
-Huh?
-(CLEARING THROAT)

56
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.271
(SNORES)

57
00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:11.066
I think my hat is leaking!

58
00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.741
MRS. CLAUS ON SPEAKER: I hope
this is recording. Is this thing on? Okay.

59
00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:22.202
This tree thingy
should be on the bookshelf.

60
00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:26.540
You need to
lock each section into place.

61
00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.251
I was never that good at
trimming the tree.

62
00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:32.713
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
The most festive side always faces out.

63
00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:34.548
Got it!

64
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:35.632
(TINKLING)

65
00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:37.050
-(RATTLING)
-(BOTH GASP)

66
00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.438
-What's happening?
-I have no idea!

67
00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:52.691
Please don't wake up.
Please don't wake up.

68
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:58.238
(GASPS) Great garland!

69
00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:07.414
MRS. CLAUS: By now you should be in
Santa's Secret Workshop.

70
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.168
This is where my husband likes to
tinker around

71
00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.962
and keeps all of his treasures and...

72
00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:17.341
Oh, gosh, mostly just stuff
I don't want in my house.

73
00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.510
This is so tinsel!

74
00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:21.136
Oh, watch out for that giant Nutcracker!

75
00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:22.221
(GASPS)

76
00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:25.599
We used to have it in our foyer
and I would trip over that thing.

77
00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:28.352
They should have called it
a hip cracker.

78
00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:33.148
Now, let's see. The box is probably
somewhere around his work bench.

79
00:04:33.232 --> 00:04:37.736
Just look for that giant pile of
manly clutter.

80
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:40.155
Jingle Time.

81
00:04:42.074 --> 00:04:43.075
(BOTH GRUNTING)

82
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:45.202
You know what this calls for?

83
00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:48.080
The old Gift Exchange!

84
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.380
-Yes!
-Great job, Tree skirt.

85
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.422

86
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.882
(GASPS)

87
00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:12.646
Oh, frostbite.

88
00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:25.200
(GRUNTING)

89
00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:28.787
Permission to worry now?

90
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.915
Permission granted.

91
00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:38.005
(GASPS)

92
00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:41.425
-We're out of time!
-Not quite.

(BELL TINKLING)

95
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.444
MRS. CLAUS: Oh,
I've waited so long for this day!

96
00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:05.449
Santa's had this wheel piece
tucked away for a long time now,

97
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.620
but the rest of it,
I finally managed to find again.

98
00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:10.787
What is it?

99
00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:13.957
Merry Christmas, sweetheart!

100
00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:18.128
THE BIG GUY:
Oh, my. Is this what I think it is?

101
00:06:19.922 --> 00:06:22.799
The first toy I ever made.

102
00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:28.680
Thank you. Thank you all so much.

103
00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:31.600
(SNIFFLES)
Mission accomplished, partner.

104
00:06:31.642 --> 00:06:33.977
I really wanted that snowmobile.
