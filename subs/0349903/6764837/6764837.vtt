- Why accept his challenge?

You lost. And not only did you lose...

1451
01:49:11.421 --> 01:49:14.591
...your entire crew got pinched.
I gotta tell you something.

1452
01:49:14.883 --> 01:49:18.595
You don't look anything like her.
Eventually, the nose, but the ears--

1453
01:49:18.803 --> 01:49:21.139
I mean, the way you walk
and you dress....

1454
01:49:41.326 --> 01:49:45.163
That means that you spoke to LeMarc.

1455
01:49:47.123 --> 01:49:48.708
You spoke to LeMarc?

1456
01:49:56.174 --> 01:49:57.509
LEMARC:
Since I'm dead...

1457
01:49:57.675 --> 01:50:02.055
...I think my involvement in this
should stay among the three of us.

1458
01:50:02.222 --> 01:50:04.057
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

1459
01:50:04.224 --> 01:50:09.938
It's ironic that the solution to all of
our problems will be provided by Toulour.

1460
01:50:10.105 --> 01:50:12.941
I'm sure I provoked him by agreeing
with my American friend...

1461
01:50:13.108 --> 01:50:14.859
...that you might be better than him.

1462
01:50:15.026 --> 01:50:18.113
I apologize sincerely for the trouble
I've caused you.

1463
01:50:18.279 --> 01:50:20.490
- There's no need.
- Especially now.

1464
01:50:20.782 --> 01:50:25.453
Remember, from the time you see Toulour
at his villa and the challenge begins...

1465
01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:30.792
...you must assume he will have you
under surveillance everywhere you go.

1466
01:50:31.292 --> 01:50:34.879
You'll have to put on
a very elaborate show.

1467
01:50:35.171 --> 01:50:38.216
The egg, the real egg...

1468
01:50:38.383 --> 01:50:41.928
...will be carried in a backpack
on a train leaving Gare du Nord...

1469
01:50:42.095 --> 01:50:45.056
- ...at 9:30 a.m.
DANNY: Thank you.

1470
01:50:45.223 --> 01:50:47.183
You saved our lives, Gaspar.

1471
01:50:47.392 --> 01:50:51.104
Yeah. And I'm still getting
the better of you.

1472
01:53:03.111 --> 01:53:05.321
And I stole a replica?

1473
01:53:06.322 --> 01:53:10.618
Your paintings are in a high-security
warehouse in Milan.

1474
01:53:10.785 --> 01:53:15.540
It's 17 Via Andreotti, unit 222.

1475
01:53:15.707 --> 01:53:21.754
- Security code is 2-3-1-1-6--
TOULOUR: 6-4-6. Thank you.

1476
01:53:23.673 --> 01:53:28.219
Listen, all games aside, that was--
That was very good.

1477
01:53:28.386 --> 01:53:30.805
That was good. How'd you do that?

1478
01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:39.981
Well, I told you one story tonight.
I think that'll be enough. So now...

1479
01:53:40.148 --> 01:53:44.986
...if you, both of you, could please....
Now.

Whose house is this?

RUSTY:
It belongs to a thief I know in Paris.

1482
01:54:23.816 --> 01:54:25.985

He knows my father?

1483
01:54:26.152 --> 01:54:28.613

Probably better than anyone.

ISABEL:
Who is he?

1485
01:54:31.407 --> 01:54:33.076
RUSTY:
He helped with the Night Fox thing.

1486
01:54:33.242 --> 01:54:35.119
ISABEL:
What's his name?

1487
01:54:35.286 --> 01:54:38.748
RUSTY:
His real name? I don't know, actually.

1488
01:54:41.667 --> 01:54:44.003
I've only known him as LeMarc.

1489
01:54:44.170 --> 01:54:45.838
LeMarc?

01:54:57.892 --> 01:54:59.811

1494
01:55:24.669 --> 01:55:26.212
For this.

1497

Issue closed?

1498
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:22.894
- Is it actually good?
- It's good. Trust me.

1499
01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:26.731
I don't trust you, and I don't
trust Ocean. If it's good, we're done.

These grudges, they're awful.
Nobody wins.

1501
01:56:30.151 --> 01:56:32.487
Danny's had enough of this <i>meshugaas.</i>

1502
01:56:32.653 --> 01:56:35.239
And the competition,
it's worse than our business.

Always some new young punk
trying to prove himself.

1504
01:56:39.952 --> 01:56:44.749
Guys like Ocean, they keep coming back.
They don't like to lose.

1505
01:56:44.916 --> 01:56:48.836
- Too much ego, too much pride.
- Maybe for some guys, but not Danny.

1506
01:56:49.003 --> 01:56:52.465
Trust me on that.
Danny don't feel like he lost in all this.

1507
01:56:52.632 --> 01:56:55.510
It's hard to believe,
but that's how he feels.

1508
01:56:55.676 --> 01:56:59.722
Well, if he tries anything-- If anybody
tries anything, I'll be waiting.

1509
01:56:59.889 --> 01:57:02.058
Terry, I can't predict the future.

1510
01:57:02.266 --> 01:57:05.811
I pay professionals to do that,
and even they get it wrong sometimes.

01:57:05.978 --> 01:57:09.106
I can't say that nobody'll ever
try to rob from you again.

1512
01:57:09.273 --> 01:57:14.028
But I can say this: If, God forbid,
anything does happen to you...
