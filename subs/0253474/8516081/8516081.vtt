00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.010
- Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello.

2
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.720
I came specially to meet you.
I love your playing.

3
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.810
- Who are you?
- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

4
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.520
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

5
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.697
You can write him a fan letter later.
This isn't the best time. Come on.

6
00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:40.451
Jurek, where have you been
hiding her?

7
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.410
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take too much.

8
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.710
How many suitcases are you taking?

9
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.920
What do you think, should I take
uncle Szymon's portrait?

10
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.261
Take it, don't take it,
take what you like.

11
00:02:58.421 --> 00:03:00.881
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

12
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:02.841
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

13
00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:07.021
- I should have another case.
- Mama, Wladek is home!

14
00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:11.521
Thank God.
Wladek! You're wounded?

15
00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:14.861
- No, it was nothing.
- I've been worried sick.

16
00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:17.611
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

17
00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.047
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd know where to take you.

18
00:03:20.071 --> 00:03:24.951
Henryk, don't say things like that.
God forbid. God forbid.

19
00:03:25.161 --> 00:03:27.201
- Papa, Wladek is home.
- What did I tell you?

20
00:03:27.411 --> 00:03:30.831
- What are you doing?
- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

21
00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:35.751
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.
- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

22
00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:37.801
Pack, darling.
Get your things packed.

23
00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:40.051
- Where are we going?
- Out of Warsaw.

24
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.881
- Out of Warsaw where?
- You haven't heard?

25
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.722
- Heard what?
- Haven't you seen the paper?

26
00:03:45.932 --> 00:03:48.432
- Where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.

27
00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:51.162
- She used it for packing.
- The government has moved to Lublin.

28
00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:55.772
All men must leave the city, go across
the river, set up a new line of defense.

29
00:03:55.982 --> 00:03:59.902
There isn't anybody left here, only
the women. The men are all gone.

30
00:04:00.112 --> 00:04:02.792
What do you think you'll do while
they set up a new line of defense?

31
00:04:02.952 --> 00:04:06.241
- Wonder around with your suitcases?
- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

32
00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:10.242
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

33
00:04:10.412 --> 00:04:13.082
Don't be ridiculous,
we've got to keep together.

34
00:04:13.292 --> 00:04:16.632
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to
die in my own home, staying put.

35
00:04:16.792 --> 00:04:20.712
- God forbid.
- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

36
00:04:20.882 --> 00:04:25.092
...from the BBC in London.
The British government...

37
00:04:25.642 --> 00:04:29.642
having received no reply
to the observations presented...

38
00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:32.102
to the German government...

39
00:04:32.312 --> 00:04:36.273
has declared war on Nazi Germany.

40
00:04:36.773 --> 00:04:40.233
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!
- It is expected that...

41
00:04:45.113 --> 00:04:50.332
...within the next few hours, France
will make a similar declaration.

42
00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:53.912
Poland is no longer alone.

43
00:04:59.093 --> 00:05:01.343
Wonderful, wonderful!

44
00:05:02.963 --> 00:05:06.973
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- It certainly was.

45
00:05:07.183 --> 00:05:09.783
When there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.

46
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.853
Here's to Great Britain and France!

47
00:05:13.393 --> 00:05:16.853
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?
All will be well.

48
00:05:50.394 --> 00:05:52.314
Five thousand and three.

49
00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:57.644
- Is that all?
- Yes. It's all we've got left.

50
00:05:57.854 --> 00:06:01.024
- It's 3,003 too much.
- Look.

51
00:06:01.234 --> 00:06:04.614
"Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets.

52
00:06:04.784 --> 00:06:08.033
Jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2,000 zlotys at home."

53
00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:12.744
- What do we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

54
00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:16.704
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

55
00:06:16.874 --> 00:06:21.544
We could hide the money. Look here.
We can hide it under the flowerpots.

56
00:06:21.754 --> 00:06:24.804
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll use try and tested methods.

57
00:06:25.004 --> 00:06:27.424
You know what we did
in the last war?

58
00:06:27.764 --> 00:06:31.514
We made a hole in the table leg,
and hid the money in there.

59
00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:34.185
- Suppose they take the table away?
- What do you mean?

60
00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:38.985
Germans go into Jewish homes and
take furniture, valuables, anything.

61
00:06:39.195 --> 00:06:41.985
- Do they?
- Why'd they want a table like this?

62
00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:46.235
- What on earth are you doing?
- Listen. Look.

63
00:06:46.535 --> 00:06:50.534
This is the best place. No-one would
think of looking under the flowerpot.

64
00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.874
- No, listen. I've been thinking...
- Really? That's a change.

65
00:06:54.084 --> 00:06:57.375
- You know what? We use psychology.
- We use what?

66
00:06:57.585 --> 00:07:02.505
We leave the money and the watch
on the table, covered. In full view.

67
00:07:05.345 --> 00:07:08.265
- Are you stupid?
- The Germans will never notice it.

68
00:07:08.465 --> 00:07:12.395
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
seen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

69
00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:14.975
Look here.

70
00:07:15.475 --> 00:07:17.065
Idiot.

71
00:07:17.435 --> 00:07:20.106
- And you call me stupid.
- Very good. That's the last place...

72
00:07:20.316 --> 00:07:22.406
- This would take hours.
- We're not in a hurry.

73
00:07:22.606 --> 00:07:25.826
- It won't take hours.
- How will you get them out? Tell me.

74
00:07:26.026 --> 00:07:29.075
- How will you get them out?
- Quiet! Order, please!

75
00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:31.995
- You reach them out individually.
- No-one listens to me!

76
00:07:32.205 --> 00:07:35.035
Quiet, please, quiet.
Order, order, please.

77
00:07:35.245 --> 00:07:39.505
- The lawyer, she likes order.
- Listen, just listen. Look.

78
00:07:39.705 --> 00:07:43.295
The watch we put under the flowerpot
and the money we stuff in the violin.

79
00:07:45.346 --> 00:07:49.966
- But I'll still be able to play?
- You'll find out.

80
00:07:50.176 --> 00:07:53.936
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek, how are you?

81
00:07:54.686 --> 00:07:56.186
We're fine, thank you.
And you?

82
00:07:57.356 --> 00:08:01.646
Fine, under the circumstances.
I guess I know why you're calling.

83
00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:06.026
There's nothing we can do.
They won't reopen the station.

84
00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:10.996
- Yes, I know, but I...
- No music, no radio for the Polish.

85
00:08:11.196 --> 00:08:14.496
But sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you.

86
00:08:14.706 --> 00:08:17.126
Maybe, maybe not, but...

87
00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:22.466
don't be offended, but I didn't call
to discuss my future carrier.

88
00:08:22.666 --> 00:08:25.886
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last he gave in and said...

89
00:08:26.086 --> 00:08:29.256
"All right, come with me tomorrow",
so I came and...

90
00:08:29.466 --> 00:08:31.847
they bombed the station.

91
00:08:32.307 --> 00:08:35.557
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.
- Really?

92
00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:39.227
Yes, it was unforgettable.

93
00:08:40.067 --> 00:08:43.027
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
- Call me Wladek, please.

94
00:08:43.237 --> 00:08:46.487
- No-one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope it's a compliment.

95
00:08:46.657 --> 00:08:50.367
- Of course, I mean it.
- I was... trying to be funny.

96
00:08:51.196 --> 00:08:54.866
- Should we go and have a coffee?
- I'd like that.

97
00:08:56.327 --> 00:09:00.167
- And you, what do you do?
- I finished with the conservatoire.

98
00:09:00.377 --> 00:09:03.337
- You're a musician?
- Yes. But only just.

99
00:09:03.547 --> 00:09:06.127
- What instrument?
- The cello.

100
00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:08.927
I love to see women
playing the cello.

101
00:09:11.637 --> 00:09:13.347
JEWS FORBIDDEN

102
00:09:13.557 --> 00:09:16.807
This is disgraceful.
How dare they?

103
00:09:17.017 --> 00:09:19.858
You know what people are like, they
want to be better Nazis than Hitler.

104
00:09:20.058 --> 00:09:23.938
- I'm going in there to complain.
- It's better not, believe me.

105
00:09:24.148 --> 00:09:27.448
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!
- Good-bye.

106
00:09:31.777 --> 00:09:34.247
We'll find somewhere else.

107
00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.747
- We can walk in the park.
- No, we can't.

108
00:09:37.957 --> 00:09:41.287
Official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

109
00:09:42.127 --> 00:09:44.628
- My God. Are you joking?
- I'm not joking, it's true.

110
00:09:44.838 --> 00:09:49.718
We could sit in a bench, but
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

111
00:09:49.928 --> 00:09:51.758
This is absurd.

112
00:09:51.968 --> 00:09:57.888
We can just stand here and talk.
I think we're allowed to do that.

113
00:09:58.768 --> 00:10:03.438
So, you play the cello. That's nice.
And who's your favorite composer?

114
00:10:03.648 --> 00:10:05.988
Chopin? Really? Well...

115
00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:09.109
you'll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

116
00:10:09.319 --> 00:10:11.449
What about you, Wladek?

117
00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:14.618
Perhaps I could accompany.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

118
00:10:14.828 --> 00:10:19.168
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

119
00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:23.458
Call me Wladek, please.

120
00:10:23.668 --> 00:10:27.338
"Free emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district."

121
00:10:27.508 --> 00:10:30.468
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

122
00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:33.929
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

123
00:10:34.139 --> 00:10:38.979
This decree will come into force
on the first of December, 1939...

124
00:10:39.189 --> 00:10:42.609
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

125
00:10:42.979 --> 00:10:46.189
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

126
00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:50.149
and will represent the blue star
of David on a white background.

127
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.868
The background must be
sufficiently large...

128
00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:57.829
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

129
00:10:58.409 --> 00:11:02.539
The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

130
00:11:02.749 --> 00:11:08.089
The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

131
00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:13.089
"Governor of the Warsaw district,
Dr. Fischer."

132
00:11:16.219 --> 00:11:20.560
- I won't wear it.
- I'm not going to be branded.

133
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.650
Let me see this.

134
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.779
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

135
00:11:35.409 --> 00:11:39.749
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to wear them.

136
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.670
You!

137
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.890
Come here.

138
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.190
Why haven't you greeted us?

139
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.270
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.580
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.

141
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.870
Go to the gutter.

142
00:12:37.261 --> 00:12:41.221
- Have you seen this?
- What? What? I'm working. What?

143
00:12:42.981 --> 00:12:44.521
What is this?

144
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:49.441
- It's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean "put us"?

145
00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:55.572
"By order of the governor of the
Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

146
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:59.451
concerning the establishment of
the Jewish district in Warsaw.

147
00:12:59.661 --> 00:13:05.291
There'll be created a Jewish district
in which Jews will have to reside."

148
00:13:06.171 --> 00:13:10.001
Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area...

149
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:15.511
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31 of October, 1940."

150
00:13:16.761 --> 00:13:18.932
They won't get all of us.
It's too small.

151
00:13:19.142 --> 00:13:21.142
There's 400 thousand of us
in Warsaw.

152
00:13:21.392 --> 00:13:24.892
No, 360 thousand.
So it will be easy.

153
00:13:25.102 --> 00:13:28.982
What am I supposed to do?
You tell me.

154
00:13:32.532 --> 00:13:34.532
Mama?

155
00:13:35.242 --> 00:13:37.821
Mama, what is it?

156
00:13:39.871 --> 00:13:42.412
20 zlotys!

157
00:13:42.622 --> 00:13:45.872
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

158
00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:52.632
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

159
00:13:53.592 --> 00:13:57.302
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

160
00:14:05.683 --> 00:14:07.983
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

161
00:14:08.143 --> 00:14:10.903
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

162
00:14:11.113 --> 00:14:15.033
- But it's a Bechstein!
- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

163
00:14:15.443 --> 00:14:18.242
What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

164
00:14:18.912 --> 00:14:21.242
- Get out!
- What's the matter with you?

165
00:14:21.412 --> 00:14:23.372
- Stop it!
- We'd rather give it away. Get out!

166
00:14:23.582 --> 00:14:26.752
Haven't you eaten today?
What are you suffering from?

167
00:14:27.412 --> 00:14:29.623
You people are crazy.

168
00:14:30.253 --> 00:14:33.843
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

169
00:14:34.053 --> 00:14:36.633
I'm not even charging
for the removal!

170
00:14:37.763 --> 00:14:40.093
You haven't eaten today.
You're crazy.

171
00:14:40.303 --> 00:14:42.143
Take it.

172
00:15:16.924 --> 00:15:18.384
Hello.

173
00:15:19.804 --> 00:15:21.844
Hello. Hi.

174
00:15:23.974 --> 00:15:26.264
I didn't want to come.

175
00:15:26.474 --> 00:15:31.064
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

176
00:15:31.274 --> 00:15:33.194
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

177
00:15:33.404 --> 00:15:35.404
Good.

178
00:15:35.614 --> 00:15:39.284
No, not really.
They arrested my cousin.

179
00:15:39.493 --> 00:15:41.864
Jurek says they'll let him out.

180
00:15:43.164 --> 00:15:47.704
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

181
00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:50.874
That's what I said myself.

182
00:15:51.464 --> 00:15:53.754
It's too absurd.

183
00:15:57.964 --> 00:16:00.924
I... I should go.

184
00:16:02.974 --> 00:16:05.725
Well, I'll see you...

185
00:16:06.395 --> 00:16:07.685
soon.

186
00:16:12.235 --> 00:16:14.485
Good-bye.

187
00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:30.795
Well...

188
00:16:30.955 --> 00:16:35.085
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

189
00:16:41.385 --> 00:16:45.725
- Where will we sleep?
- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

190
00:16:45.935 --> 00:16:48.935
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

191
00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:52.486
Look.

192
00:16:53.736 --> 00:16:56.026
Come and look.

193
00:17:28.346 --> 00:17:30.266
Go away.

194
00:17:30.436 --> 00:17:32.726
Go away! Go away!

195
00:17:33.776 --> 00:17:36.986
Papa! Papa!

196
00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:56.296
- Sell anything?
- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

197
00:17:56.466 --> 00:17:59.136
- 3 zlotys.
- It's better than yesterday.

198
00:17:59.296 --> 00:18:03.597
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

199
00:18:03.807 --> 00:18:06.477
- I know.
- You don't know, believe me.

200
00:18:06.847 --> 00:18:10.097
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

201
00:18:10.307 --> 00:18:15.107
They bring cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

202
00:18:15.317 --> 00:18:17.463
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a.

203
00:18:17.487 --> 00:18:21.117
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

204
00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:25.536
A tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard.

205
00:18:25.746 --> 00:18:30.287
- I'm afraid not.
- Excuse me. Good-bye.

206
00:18:30.497 --> 00:18:34.167
Sleep well. But if you see him,
write to me, yes?

207
00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:36.417
Izaak Szerman.

208
00:18:51.438 --> 00:18:54.648
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

209
00:18:54.858 --> 00:18:57.028
Why can't they go around?

210
00:18:57.238 --> 00:19:00.948
Don't worry. They're about to build
a bridge. Haven't you heard?

211
00:19:01.858 --> 00:19:03.867
A bridge! Those idiots.

212
00:19:05.197 --> 00:19:07.657
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

213
00:19:07.827 --> 00:19:11.367
But do you know what I think?
I think they're totally stupid.

214
00:19:11.707 --> 00:19:14.587
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here...

215
00:19:14.788 --> 00:19:17.048
waiting for them to let us through.

216
00:19:17.918 --> 00:19:20.508
Maybe they think I come here
to listen to the music?

217
00:19:21.008 --> 00:19:25.888
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?
- What's wrong with you?

218
00:19:26.058 --> 00:19:30.388
- Come on, do something.
- Right. Dance!

219
00:19:30.688 --> 00:19:33.348
- Dance!
- Dance!

220
00:19:33.558 --> 00:19:36.478
Come on, come on! Dance!

221
00:19:39.739 --> 00:19:41.529
Very well.

222
00:19:41.739 --> 00:19:43.699
What about you?
Dance with him.

223
00:19:45.158 --> 00:19:49.448
Let's clear the street,
so the Jews can dance.

224
00:19:52.748 --> 00:19:55.038
Come on. And you.

225
00:20:01.128 --> 00:20:02.839
Go on.

226
00:20:04.389 --> 00:20:05.389
Faster!

227
00:20:07.059 --> 00:20:09.219
Come on!

228
00:20:10.929 --> 00:20:11.929
Faster!

229
00:20:15.769 --> 00:20:17.519
Come on!

230
00:20:18.399 --> 00:20:21.029
Faster!

231
00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:27.949
Come on, move! I said faster!
Come on, Jews!

232
00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:31.159
- Keep dancing.
- Dance.

233
00:20:49.969 --> 00:20:51.680
Good, they're here.

234
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.350
Itzak Heller has been
waiting for you.

235
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.210
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

236
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.779
I'll start lunch
when the girls get here.

237
00:21:12.659 --> 00:21:16.000
- So, what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes.

238
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:21.840
His father is back in the jewellery
business. He's doing well.

239
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.800
Amazing, jewellery.

240
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.390
- We're recruiting.
- Who is recruiting?

241
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.060
Don't be clever with me.
I'm coming as a friend.

242
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.480
They're bringing Jews in
from all over the country.

243
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.760
Soon there will be half million people
in the ghetto.

244
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.901
- We need more Jewish police.
- More Jewish police!

245
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:44.611
You want me to beat up Jews
and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

246
00:21:45.191 --> 00:21:47.360
- Someone has got to do it.
- But why me?

247
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.950
I thought you only recruited boys
with rich fathers.

248
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.160
Look at my father, look at us...

249
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.500
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm
here. You can have a better life.

250
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.130
- You want to survive selling books?
- Yes, please.

251
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.711
I'm doing you people a favor.

252
00:22:03.171 --> 00:22:05.671
What about you?
You're a great pianist.

253
00:22:05.921 --> 00:22:08.441
We've got a police jazz band.
They'd welcome you with open arms.

254
00:22:08.551 --> 00:22:11.721
- Join us. You've got no work.
- Thank you, I've got work.

255
00:23:00.982 --> 00:23:02.942
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

256
00:23:05.402 --> 00:23:07.902
Who wants me to stop?

257
00:23:59.162 --> 00:24:01.003
I always say,
look on the bright side.

258
00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:04.633
You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

259
00:24:04.833 --> 00:24:08.383
You're better off than us. Here in
the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

260
00:24:08.593 --> 00:24:11.723
- You have to give me something.
- You're an artist...

261
00:24:11.923 --> 00:24:13.973
you keep peoples' spirits up.
You do enough.

262
00:24:14.223 --> 00:24:17.723
- I want to help, do something.
- You're too well known.

263
00:24:17.933 --> 00:24:22.853
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

264
00:24:23.063 --> 00:24:27.194
You're too... too musical.

265
00:24:33.033 --> 00:24:34.163
- Who is that?
- Symche.

266
00:24:34.363 --> 00:24:36.533
Majorek.

267
00:24:37.583 --> 00:24:40.753
There are notices going up. City is
to be cleansed of the undesirables.

268
00:24:40.953 --> 00:24:43.963
- There's always notices going up.
- Hello, Symche.

269
00:24:45.043 --> 00:24:48.343
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

270
00:24:50.054 --> 00:24:52.174
Jehuda, working hard?

271
00:24:52.384 --> 00:24:56.344
This is the greatest pianist in
Poland. Maybe the whole world.

272
00:24:56.554 --> 00:24:59.474
Wladyslaw Szpilman,
meet Majorek.

273
00:24:59.684 --> 00:25:01.524
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

274
00:25:02.644 --> 00:25:05.234
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the Army.

275
00:25:05.944 --> 00:25:10.444
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

276
00:25:11.823 --> 00:25:15.204
You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

277
00:25:16.284 --> 00:25:19.164
You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

278
00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:21.374
Five hundred.

279
00:25:21.544 --> 00:25:24.874
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

280
00:25:25.084 --> 00:25:29.714
That makes 10 thousand readers.
This will start the uprising.

281
00:25:29.924 --> 00:25:33.174
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

282
00:25:33.384 --> 00:25:36.225
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.

283
00:25:36.435 --> 00:25:38.975
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

284
00:25:39.185 --> 00:25:41.185
They're too clean for them.

285
00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:49.945
Please, mister, please.

286
00:26:18.015 --> 00:26:21.515
Hold it!
You little.

287
00:26:24.146 --> 00:26:26.486
Take this!

288
00:26:26.646 --> 00:26:28.696
Stop it! Stop it!

289
00:26:29.656 --> 00:26:30.696
Stop it!

290
00:26:33.485 --> 00:26:36.655
Come on, come on.
Come on, boy.

291
00:26:42.705 --> 00:26:46.665
Stand up! Stand up.

292
00:27:16.536 --> 00:27:21.286
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

293
00:27:21.496 --> 00:27:25.036
- Enjoy your meal.
- Then I'll tell you something funny.

294
00:27:25.246 --> 00:27:28.256
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?
- The surgeon.

295
00:27:28.456 --> 00:27:33.296
The Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

296
00:27:33.506 --> 00:27:36.677
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

297
00:27:36.887 --> 00:27:40.307
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so...

298
00:27:40.517 --> 00:27:42.897
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

299
00:27:43.057 --> 00:27:45.397
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

300
00:27:46.017 --> 00:27:50.187
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja
and everybody else who was there.

301
00:27:52.527 --> 00:27:54.987
Isn't that a laugh?

302
00:27:55.906 --> 00:27:59.117
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized.

303
00:27:59.287 --> 00:28:01.117
I said nothing bad.

304
00:28:01.787 --> 00:28:05.537
What's the matter with you all?
You lost your sense of humor?

305
00:28:06.667 --> 00:28:08.417
It's not funny.

306
00:28:08.627 --> 00:28:12.047
You know what's funny? You're
funny, with that ridiculous tie.

307
00:28:13.427 --> 00:28:16.427
What are you talking about? What's
my tie have to do with anything?

308
00:28:16.757 --> 00:28:18.887
- I need this tie for my work.
- Your work?

309
00:28:19.097 --> 00:28:23.388
- That's right, I work.
- Playing the piano for the parasites.

310
00:28:23.598 --> 00:28:26.768
- Parasites...
- Boys. Boys!

311
00:28:26.938 --> 00:28:29.528
- They don't give a.
- And you blame me for their apathy?

312
00:28:29.728 --> 00:28:33.238
I see it everyday. They don't even
notice what's going around them.

313
00:28:33.448 --> 00:28:35.408
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?

314
00:28:35.988 --> 00:28:38.787
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

315
00:28:39.787 --> 00:28:43.077
What do they think they're doing?
People here are dying.

316
00:28:43.287 --> 00:28:45.577
Haven't got a bite to eat.

317
00:28:46.207 --> 00:28:51.088
The Jewish bankers should persuade
America to declare war on Germany.

318
00:29:07.978 --> 00:29:10.188
The lights! The lights!

319
00:29:28.078 --> 00:29:32.338
Turn on the lights.

320
00:29:35.009 --> 00:29:37.719
Come on!

321
00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:44.979
Open the door!
We want to go in!

322
00:29:46.849 --> 00:29:48.809
Open the door!

323
00:30:02.619 --> 00:30:04.699
Stand up!

324
00:30:06.869 --> 00:30:10.459
You, stand up! Come on!

325
00:30:11.089 --> 00:30:13.669
Throw him out!

326
00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.020
Mama...

327
00:30:41.409 --> 00:30:44.829
Come on, run!

328
00:31:51.561 --> 00:31:56.071
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
- Go in. Not you.

329
00:32:15.921 --> 00:32:18.001
- What?
- Come. It's terrible.

330
00:32:18.211 --> 00:32:21.342
- What?
- They're hunting people in the streets.

331
00:32:21.592 --> 00:32:23.802
They've taken Henryk.

332
00:32:25.392 --> 00:32:28.432
Go home, alright? Go home,
I'll take care of it.

333
00:32:40.112 --> 00:32:43.781
Excuse me. Have you seen
my husband? Izaak Szerman?

334
00:32:43.991 --> 00:32:47.872
- I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

335
00:32:48.082 --> 00:32:51.792
If you see him, write to me.
Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

336
00:33:01.762 --> 00:33:03.552
What happened here?

337
00:33:03.762 --> 00:33:07.512
They've got my grandson. They
pick them up and take them away.

338
00:33:07.722 --> 00:33:11.433
What they do to them,
I've stopped believing in God.

339
00:33:12.313 --> 00:33:15.143
Excuse me. Excuse me.

340
00:33:16.233 --> 00:33:18.063
Itzak?

341
00:33:18.653 --> 00:33:20.193
Itzak?

342
00:33:20.403 --> 00:33:23.902
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

343
00:33:30.202 --> 00:33:32.703
- Henryk is in there.
- I haven't seen him.

344
00:33:32.913 --> 00:33:35.083
Believe me.
They picked him up.

345
00:33:39.383 --> 00:33:43.423
- Can you help?
- Now you need me. Now you need me!

346
00:33:43.593 --> 00:33:45.843
Can you help us?

347
00:33:46.513 --> 00:33:49.223
- It costs.
- I have no money.

348
00:33:49.433 --> 00:33:52.023
Then there's nothing I can do.
You should have joined us.

349
00:33:52.223 --> 00:33:56.644
- They told me you had influence.
- Who told you?

350
00:33:56.814 --> 00:34:00.404
People I know. They said
you're an important man.

351
00:34:03.573 --> 00:34:05.533
Itzak...

352
00:34:21.424 --> 00:34:24.384
- Hands up.
- How are you?

353
00:34:24.594 --> 00:34:28.304
- How are you?
- You, bandit.

354
00:34:28.514 --> 00:34:30.684
Dead! Dead!

355
00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:34.104
- He's crazy.
- Hands up.

356
00:34:34.314 --> 00:34:37.444
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette?

357
00:34:37.944 --> 00:34:40.944
Thank you.

358
00:34:41.654 --> 00:34:45.614
Everything is alright!

359
00:34:45.824 --> 00:34:47.954
He looks very happy.

360
00:34:48.154 --> 00:34:51.034
Everything is alright.

361
00:34:51.244 --> 00:34:54.664
Everything is alright.

362
00:34:55.204 --> 00:34:58.794
Hands up! Hands up!

363
00:34:59.294 --> 00:35:00.674
It's alright.

364
00:35:02.464 --> 00:35:04.674
Help! Help!

365
00:35:04.884 --> 00:35:08.515
Let go! Help!

366
00:36:01.816 --> 00:36:05.276
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Itzak Heller?

367
00:36:05.486 --> 00:36:09.035
- Did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

368
00:36:09.195 --> 00:36:14.165
- Did you beg to that piece of.
- I asked him to help you.

369
00:36:14.785 --> 00:36:17.045
What did you pay him?

370
00:36:17.995 --> 00:36:22.506
With what could I pay him? Every
zloty I earn we spend on food.

371
00:36:22.716 --> 00:36:25.756
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

372
00:36:25.966 --> 00:36:29.886
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

373
00:36:30.096 --> 00:36:33.436
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

374
00:36:33.596 --> 00:36:37.766
- You're mad. That's your trouble.
- That's also my business.

375
00:36:46.986 --> 00:36:50.326
What's the matter?
Are you sick?

376
00:36:51.366 --> 00:36:53.786
Hungry.

377
00:37:01.006 --> 00:37:05.336
Employment certificate. What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

378
00:37:05.546 --> 00:37:08.387
You have to have an
employment certificate...

379
00:37:08.597 --> 00:37:11.177
to work for the Germans
in the ghetto, otherwise...

380
00:37:11.387 --> 00:37:14.227
- Otherwise what?
- You'll be deported.

381
00:37:14.437 --> 00:37:17.767
- So the rumors were true.
- They're going to resettle us...

382
00:37:18.687 --> 00:37:21.817
and send us to labor camps,
in the East.

383
00:37:23.737 --> 00:37:26.737
- They're closing the small ghetto.
- Oh, God!

384
00:37:42.047 --> 00:37:43.967
Wladek? Wladek?

385
00:37:45.047 --> 00:37:48.927
I thought you were on tour playing
in London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

386
00:37:49.137 --> 00:37:51.927
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

387
00:37:52.267 --> 00:37:55.098
Have you heard the rumors? They're
going to resettle us in the East.

388
00:37:55.308 --> 00:37:59.438
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart. What's the trouble?

389
00:37:59.648 --> 00:38:04.068
I've been trying to get the certificate
of employment for my father.

390
00:38:04.238 --> 00:38:07.658
I managed to get one for me and my
family, but I need one for my father.

391
00:38:07.858 --> 00:38:11.077
- I've been to all the firms and shops...
- Why didn't you come to me?

392
00:38:11.327 --> 00:38:13.447
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

393
00:38:13.657 --> 00:38:16.117
I'm not, but Majorek is.

394
00:38:18.207 --> 00:38:20.418
Can you help?
I have no money.

395
00:38:20.588 --> 00:38:24.008
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

396
00:38:24.208 --> 00:38:26.628
Be at the Schultz workshop
tomorrow, four o'clock.

397
00:38:26.918 --> 00:38:29.588
See what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

398
00:38:29.798 --> 00:38:33.678
That's the historical imperative in
action! That's why I always say:

399
00:38:33.888 --> 00:38:36.268
- "Look on the bright side!"
- Yes, I know.

400
00:38:49.408 --> 00:38:51.988
- How's your back?
- Better.

401
00:38:52.198 --> 00:38:54.198
Better?

402
00:38:54.368 --> 00:38:56.368
Better not ask.

403
00:39:09.429 --> 00:39:14.559
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

404
00:39:17.019 --> 00:39:19.349
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

405
00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.380
At least we got work
in the ghetto.

406
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.760
At least we are still together.

407
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:53.450
Everybody out!
To the courtyard!

408
00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:56.030
Move, move!

409
00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:01.000
We are workers. We have
employment certification.

410
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:06.921
Wait.

411
00:41:07.671 --> 00:41:08.671
Here.

412
00:41:08.961 --> 00:41:12.091
Go over there. Hurry.

413
00:41:12.301 --> 00:41:14.301
You.

414
00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:17.391
You. You.

415
00:41:19.181 --> 00:41:20.971
You.

416
00:41:22.681 --> 00:41:24.601
You.

417
00:41:26.021 --> 00:41:28.191
You.

418
00:41:37.031 --> 00:41:40.451
The others, put your clothes on
and come back here.

419
00:41:40.661 --> 00:41:43.871
Bring your things with you.
15 kilos only.

420
00:41:44.081 --> 00:41:47.001
Where are you taking us?

421
00:42:10.732 --> 00:42:13.282
I'm sorry, I did my best.

422
00:42:15.651 --> 00:42:18.662
- I thought the certificates'd save us.
- Stop it, Wladek.

423
00:42:18.822 --> 00:42:22.452
Let's just hope that Henryk
and Halina will be better off.

424
00:42:49.983 --> 00:42:52.323
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

425
00:42:52.483 --> 00:42:55.902
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

426
00:43:00.532 --> 00:43:04.493
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

427
00:43:05.203 --> 00:43:10.583
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

428
00:43:11.883 --> 00:43:15.423
Why did I do it?

429
00:43:58.634 --> 00:44:01.344
Don't you have a bottle of water?
He's dying.

430
00:44:01.554 --> 00:44:03.474
My child is dying of thirst.

431
00:44:03.644 --> 00:44:05.564
- I beg you.
- I'm sorry.

432
00:44:05.724 --> 00:44:09.644
- Don't you have water? I beg you.
- Can you hear what I'm saying?

433
00:44:09.814 --> 00:44:12.154
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
- I can hear you.

434
00:44:12.354 --> 00:44:14.794
Letting them take us to our death
like sheep to the slaughter.

435
00:44:14.864 --> 00:44:17.034
- Not so loud.
- Why don't we attack them?

436
00:44:17.234 --> 00:44:20.404
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

437
00:44:20.614 --> 00:44:23.334
At least we can die honorably, not
as a stain on the face of History.

438
00:44:23.534 --> 00:44:26.244
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

439
00:44:26.454 --> 00:44:29.044
You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

440
00:44:29.584 --> 00:44:33.294
- They're going to wipe us all out.
- What do you want me to do? Fight?

441
00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:36.134
To fight, we need organization,
plans, guns.

442
00:44:36.294 --> 00:44:38.964
He's right. Do you think I'm going
to fight with my violin bowl?

443
00:44:39.174 --> 00:44:42.015
The Germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this.

444
00:44:42.555 --> 00:44:44.645
They're sending us to a labor camp,
it's obvious.

445
00:44:44.845 --> 00:44:46.225
Sure.

446
00:44:46.395 --> 00:44:50.815
Look at that cripple, the old people,
the children. They're going to work?

447
00:44:51.065 --> 00:44:54.815
Look at you. You're going to carry
logs on your back?

448
00:45:36.776 --> 00:45:40.115
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

449
00:45:50.035 --> 00:45:54.466
I missed you.
I wanted to be with you!

450
00:46:03.266 --> 00:46:05.806
I wanted to be with you!

451
00:46:05.976 --> 00:46:08.096
Stupid. Stupid.

452
00:46:08.476 --> 00:46:12.726
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

453
00:46:12.896 --> 00:46:16.197
She's getting on my nerves.

454
00:46:20.196 --> 00:46:25.156
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

455
00:46:27.166 --> 00:46:30.706
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

456
00:46:30.916 --> 00:46:33.796
The baby cried
just as the police came.

457
00:46:34.006 --> 00:46:38.176
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

458
00:46:39.427 --> 00:46:43.217
A policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding.

459
00:47:08.367 --> 00:47:10.667
What are you reading?

460
00:47:13.087 --> 00:47:17.967
"If you us, de we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

461
00:47:18.127 --> 00:47:20.387
If you poison us, do we not die?

462
00:47:20.587 --> 00:47:23.717
And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

463
00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:34.858
- Very appropriate.
- Yes. That's why I brought it.

464
00:47:52.708 --> 00:47:56.338
Idiot. What does he think
he's gonna do with the money?

465
00:47:57.418 --> 00:48:00.168
Boy, come here.

466
00:48:00.928 --> 00:48:02.718
Come here.

467
00:48:04.048 --> 00:48:06.058
- How much for a caramel?
- 20 zlotys.

468
00:48:06.848 --> 00:48:09.728
For one caramel? What do you think
you're gonna do with the money?

469
00:48:09.928 --> 00:48:12.228
20 zlotys.

470
00:48:13.768 --> 00:48:15.979
We've got 20 between us.

471
00:48:16.149 --> 00:48:18.739
I've got 10, I think.

472
00:48:21.488 --> 00:48:24.278
5, 10, 20.

473
00:49:46.989 --> 00:49:49.830
- Halina?
- What?

474
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:55.160
- It's a funny time to say this, but...
- What?

475
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:59.710
I wish I knew you better.

476
00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:04.470
Thank you.

477
00:50:20.861 --> 00:50:22.571
Szpilman?

478
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.700
Papa? Papa?

479
00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.501
Mama? Halina?

480
00:50:40.081 --> 00:50:42.671
Halina? Mama?

481
00:50:43.301 --> 00:50:48.301
What do you think you're doing?
I've saved your life. Just go! Go!

482
00:50:51.931 --> 00:50:54.221
Don't run!

483
00:50:55.811 --> 00:50:57.891
Anna!

484
00:50:58.061 --> 00:51:00.441
Anna!

485
00:51:20.121 --> 00:51:23.291
Off they go to the melting pot.

486
00:51:26.342 --> 00:51:31.092
- This stays.
- Give it to me!

487
00:51:36.182 --> 00:51:38.942
What are you doing?
She's pregnant.

488
00:54:05.964 --> 00:54:07.924
Wladek?

489
00:54:26.105 --> 00:54:29.195
Why are you here, Wladek?

490
00:54:29.404 --> 00:54:32.114
It's like this, I...

491
00:54:33.784 --> 00:54:35.705
We...

492
00:54:37.995 --> 00:54:40.915
All of them, all of them.

493
00:54:41.085 --> 00:54:43.335
All of them.

494
00:54:44.455 --> 00:54:48.425
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker, the better.

495
00:54:48.625 --> 00:54:51.795
It's not finished yet. We'll stay
here for a couple of days...

496
00:54:52.005 --> 00:54:54.015
until things die down.

497
00:54:54.215 --> 00:54:57.725
I've bribed the policeman,
he'll come when it's over.

498
00:54:59.936 --> 00:55:03.686
Attention!
On the march!

499
00:55:13.695 --> 00:55:15.655
Onward!

500
00:55:18.035 --> 00:55:21.165
My God, I haven't been outside in,
it must be two years.

501
00:55:21.375 --> 00:55:24.376
Don't get overexcited.

502
00:55:40.346 --> 00:55:43.556
It's gold.
Very good price.

503
00:56:04.626 --> 00:56:06.586
Someone you know?

504
00:56:06.746 --> 00:56:08.756
A beauty.
Who is she?

505
00:56:08.966 --> 00:56:13.047
She's a singer. I knew her well.
Her husband is an actor.

506
00:56:13.257 --> 00:56:15.717
They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her.

507
00:56:15.887 --> 00:56:19.767
Don't forget, Wladek.
They hang them for helping Jews.

508
00:56:46.587 --> 00:56:49.007
Turn left!

509
00:56:49.167 --> 00:56:51.667
On the march!

510
00:56:55.847 --> 00:56:58.638
Stop! Halt!
Attention!

511
00:57:05.978 --> 00:57:08.898
At ease.

512
00:57:12.987 --> 00:57:15.777
Turn right!

513
00:57:22.958 --> 00:57:25.668
Step forward.

514
00:57:26.208 --> 00:57:27.788
You.

515
00:57:30.048 --> 00:57:32.628
You. You.

516
00:57:33.338 --> 00:57:35.178
You.

517
00:57:39.138 --> 00:57:41.218
Down on the ground!

518
00:57:41.388 --> 00:57:44.558
Down on the ground!

519
00:58:11.839 --> 00:58:13.969
Turn left!

520
00:58:15.129 --> 00:58:17.589
On the march.

521
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:59.890
How long have you been here?

522
00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:03.010
Since last night.

523
00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.640
I was pleased to see you.

524
00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:12.900
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

525
00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:17.069
We know what it means.

526
00:59:18.149 --> 00:59:22.080
We sent someone out.
Zygmund, a good man.

527
00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:28.080
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

528
00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:31.630
He got to Sokolow.

529
00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:36.590
A man told him the tracks divided,
one branch's leading to Treblinka.

530
00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:42.220
He said everyday freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw...

531
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:46.431
branch off to Treblinka
and return empty.

532
00:59:46.601 --> 00:59:49.641
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

533
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:53.901
The civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

534
00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.240
They're exterminating us.

535
01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.740
It won't take them long.

536
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.711
We are 60 thousand left,
out of half a million.

537
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:15.091
Mostly young people.

538
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:19.421
And this time we're gonna fight.

539
01:00:21.181 --> 01:00:23.971
We're in good shape.

540
01:00:24.181 --> 01:00:28.141
Organized.
We're prepared.

541
01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:31.191
If you need help, I...

542
01:00:50.661 --> 01:00:54.001
You! Come here!

543
01:01:04.892 --> 01:01:07.262
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

544
01:01:08.392 --> 01:01:10.932
I don't know what I was thinking.

545
01:01:20.191 --> 01:01:24.612
Take this! Take this!

546
01:01:39.252 --> 01:01:42.092
Take him away.

547
01:01:57.483 --> 01:02:01.402
I hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

548
01:02:03.072 --> 01:02:05.662
He won't last long
if he goes on like this.

549
01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:08.783
I'll see if I can get him
something better.

550
01:02:31.473 --> 01:02:33.224
Trouble.

551
01:02:33.474 --> 01:02:35.944
Round up only the Jews!

552
01:02:36.194 --> 01:02:39.114
Round up!
Only the Jews.

553
01:02:39.364 --> 01:02:42.783
The Polish keep working.
Only the Jews.

554
01:02:50.073 --> 01:02:53.043
I have good news for you.

555
01:02:53.243 --> 01:02:58.174
There are rumors going around
that we like to...

556
01:02:58.374 --> 01:03:01.294
to resettle you.

557
01:03:03.214 --> 01:03:08.264
I promise you that now
and in the future...

558
01:03:08.474 --> 01:03:12.064
nothing else is planned.

559
01:03:13.064 --> 01:03:19.404
For this reason, we put
information posters on the wall.

560
01:03:20.735 --> 01:03:24.074
To show you our goodwill...

561
01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:28.204
you should vote one of you
to be allowed...

562
01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:31.454
to go in town daily...

563
01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:38.044
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

564
01:03:38.254 --> 01:03:42.754
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

565
01:03:42.924 --> 01:03:48.385
So, why should we do something
like this if we'd resettle you?

566
01:03:49.595 --> 01:03:54.975
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

567
01:03:56.475 --> 01:04:02.154
Isn't that something that you Jews
are good in? Making money?

568
01:04:06.114 --> 01:04:07.285
Dismiss them.

569
01:04:23.635 --> 01:04:27.595
That one, with the string.
The others, tied by wire.

570
01:05:36.326 --> 01:05:37.496
Now!

571
01:06:15.037 --> 01:06:17.037
Majorek.

572
01:06:18.747 --> 01:06:21.707
I have a favor to ask.

573
01:06:22.337 --> 01:06:24.717
I want to get out of here.

574
01:06:27.427 --> 01:06:31.928
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll
survive on the other side that's hard.

575
01:06:32.138 --> 01:06:34.428
I know.

576
01:06:35.228 --> 01:06:39.108
Last summer, I worked for a day
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

577
01:06:39.308 --> 01:06:42.818
I saw someone I knew,
she's an old friend.

578
01:06:42.938 --> 01:06:46.487
A singer, her husband
is an actor.

579
01:06:47.987 --> 01:06:52.117
I've filled their names down and
their address, if they're still there.

580
01:06:52.287 --> 01:06:57.248
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej
Bogucki. They're good people.

581
01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:01.208
Would you try to make contact?

582
01:07:02.298 --> 01:07:08.048
You go to town everyday. Ask them
if they'd help me get out of here.

583
01:07:40.998 --> 01:07:43.709
Have you got any plaster?

584
01:07:53.049 --> 01:07:56.349
What are you up to?

585
01:07:57.929 --> 01:08:00.479
What have you got there?

586
01:08:00.689 --> 01:08:04.649
We are allowed to take
food to the ghetto.

587
01:08:04.859 --> 01:08:07.689
Three kilos of potato and bread.

588
01:08:07.859 --> 01:08:09.989
Open it.

589
01:08:13.739 --> 01:08:18.749
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying. That's not true.

590
01:08:20.159 --> 01:08:22.329
Open it.

591
01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:52.489
Potatoes!

592
01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.160
You Jews are all alike.

593
01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:03.080
We reach you with a finger...

594
01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:06.290
and you take the whole hand.

595
01:09:19.601 --> 01:09:23.981
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill you. Personally.

596
01:09:47.961 --> 01:09:50.251
I've tried your friends.

597
01:09:50.421 --> 01:09:53.841
- They don't live there anymore.
- Did you make contact?

598
01:09:54.381 --> 01:09:56.511
- Be ready to leave.
- When?

599
01:09:56.721 --> 01:09:58.641
- Soon.
- Halt!

600
01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:05.102
Wait. What's going on here?

601
01:10:05.312 --> 01:10:08.982
Take this! Take this!

602
01:10:15.241 --> 01:10:19.281
I'll teach you some discipline,
you dirty Jews.

603
01:10:23.621 --> 01:10:26.001
Do you know why
you're being hit?

604
01:10:26.171 --> 01:10:29.342
- No.
- Do you know why you're being hit?

605
01:10:29.542 --> 01:10:34.092
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year.

606
01:10:36.382 --> 01:10:38.642
On the march!

607
01:10:38.972 --> 01:10:41.472
March and sing!

608
01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:43.642
Sing something nice!

609
01:10:44.392 --> 01:10:47.352
Loud and clear!

610
01:10:48.192 --> 01:10:52.191
Reunite tonight
And follow the white eagle.

611
01:10:52.402 --> 01:10:56.532
Stand up and fight
Our mortal enemies.

612
01:10:56.702 --> 01:11:00.582
Rise on the day
Let's give them fire and brimstone.

613
01:11:00.742 --> 01:11:04.752
We'll do away
The Yoke of slavery.

614
01:11:04.912 --> 01:11:08.712
Punish and rout
The rapists of our nation.

615
01:11:08.882 --> 01:11:13.052
We'll slash them out
To save our dignity.

616
01:11:46.703 --> 01:11:48.753
Come.

617
01:13:03.284 --> 01:13:04.994
I'm sorry.

618
01:13:05.204 --> 01:13:07.954
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

619
01:13:32.985 --> 01:13:35.944
We haven't much time.
Come on.

620
01:13:43.655 --> 01:13:45.535
We must hurry.

621
01:13:45.665 --> 01:13:48.035
Here. See if this fit.

622
01:13:48.245 --> 01:13:52.375
We have to keep moving you. Germans
are hunting down indiscriminately.

623
01:13:52.585 --> 01:13:55.835
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

624
01:13:56.005 --> 01:13:59.965
You better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

625
01:14:14.856 --> 01:14:17.815
You'll be looked after
by Gebczynski.

626
01:14:18.025 --> 01:14:20.075
He's on the other side of town.

627
01:14:20.195 --> 01:14:24.075
You stay there tonight,
then we'll find you somewhere else.

628
01:14:24.535 --> 01:14:28.996
- I'll bring you food.
- Alright, let's go.

629
01:15:08.326 --> 01:15:11.246
I'll show you where
you're going to sleep.

630
01:15:41.617 --> 01:15:44.577
You have to stay here
until tomorrow afternoon.

631
01:15:44.787 --> 01:15:49.707
We have a flat for you near
the ghetto wall. But it's safe.

632
01:15:57.007 --> 01:15:59.507
It's not going to be very comfortable.

633
01:16:00.047 --> 01:16:02.048
I'll be fine.

634
01:16:11.978 --> 01:16:14.148
Thank you.

635
01:16:29.578 --> 01:16:32.248
Here. Here. Give it to me.

636
01:16:32.918 --> 01:16:36.878
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

637
01:16:55.229 --> 01:16:57.019
DO NOT PASS

638
01:17:28.349 --> 01:17:30.889
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

639
01:17:36.399 --> 01:17:40.149
But you leave them open
during the day. Don't forget.

640
01:17:43.109 --> 01:17:46.489
Must feel better on
this side of the wall, eh?

641
01:17:46.699 --> 01:17:48.239
Yes.

642
01:17:49.489 --> 01:17:54.079
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

643
01:17:55.919 --> 01:17:59.589
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

644
01:17:59.799 --> 01:18:03.220
I'll come again.
Janina will visit you twice a week.

645
01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.890
To bring more food,
see how you are.

646
01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:08.390
Thank you.

647
01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.940
This is very important.
In case of emergency...

648
01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:18.440
I mean emergency,
go to this address.

649
01:19:00.981 --> 01:19:03.190
What do you mean you forgot?

650
01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:06.360
What do you think I mean?
I forgot, that's what I mean.

651
01:19:06.490 --> 01:19:12.080
- You know, you treat me like dirt.
- Because you are a dirt.

652
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:14.751
Pig! Pig!

653
01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:17.751
- Dirty pig!
- You are a dirty pig!

654
01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:20.671
Takes one to know one. Pig.

655
01:19:24.761 --> 01:19:29.591
- You play like an angel.
- Then why don't you listen?

656
01:19:29.761 --> 01:19:32.011
- I'm listening.
- Liar.

657
01:19:32.181 --> 01:19:35.521
You fell asleep. Pig.

658
01:19:56.871 --> 01:20:00.922
Spread out!
We're being attacked!

659
01:20:03.422 --> 01:20:05.842
Take cover!

660
01:20:07.512 --> 01:20:08.512
Shoot!

661
01:20:20.602 --> 01:20:23.481
Take cover! Fire!

662
01:20:27.652 --> 01:20:30.452
Come on, get out!

663
01:21:57.993 --> 01:22:00.294
The attack was successful.

664
01:22:02.294 --> 01:22:04.544
That building...

665
01:22:12.304 --> 01:22:14.384
Turn that way!

666
01:22:21.104 --> 01:22:23.024
Shoot!

667
01:22:47.255 --> 01:22:49.255
Thank you.

668
01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:55.635
- I wanted to come earlier, but...
- No, thank you.

669
01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:03.525
No-one thought
they'd hold out so long.

670
01:23:03.685 --> 01:23:06.420
I never should've come out. I should
have stayed and fought with them.

671
01:23:06.444 --> 01:23:09.904
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

672
01:23:10.064 --> 01:23:12.985
Just be proud of them.

673
01:23:13.195 --> 01:23:16.745
- My God, did they put up a fight!
- Yes.

674
01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:21.625
- So did the Germans.
- They are in shock!

675
01:23:21.835 --> 01:23:27.585
They didn't expect it. Nobody
expected it. Jews fighting back.

676
01:23:27.755 --> 01:23:32.595
- Who would have thought?
- What good did it do?

677
01:23:32.755 --> 01:23:34.806
What good?

678
01:23:35.016 --> 01:23:37.436
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

679
01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:42.436
They died with dignity.
And you know something else?

680
01:23:43.316 --> 01:23:47.525
Now the Poles will rise.
We are ready.

681
01:23:47.735 --> 01:23:51.115
We'll fight too.
You'll see.

682
01:24:05.376 --> 01:24:08.046
Get your things together.
You have to leave.

683
01:24:08.256 --> 01:24:10.886
What? What's happened?

684
01:24:13.296 --> 01:24:15.596
- I'm on the run.
- What's happened?

685
01:24:15.806 --> 01:24:19.936
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

686
01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:24.687
They're bound to find out about this
place too. You must get away at once.

687
01:24:24.897 --> 01:24:27.317
Where do you want me to go?

688
01:24:27.487 --> 01:24:31.026
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

689
01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:35.486
- Can I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.

690
01:24:35.656 --> 01:24:38.446
But when they storm the flat,
throw yourself out the window...

691
01:24:38.656 --> 01:24:40.496
don't let them get you alive.

692
01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:43.916
I have poison on me.
They won't get me alive either.

693
01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:02.330
Open up!

694
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:09.330
Open the door
or we'll call the police!

695
01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:41.320
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.

696
01:28:41.530 --> 01:28:44.781
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just
came to visit, but I missed him.

697
01:28:44.951 --> 01:28:47.411
Have you got your identity card?

698
01:28:48.041 --> 01:28:51.001
- Let me see your identity card.
- Yes, of course.

699
01:28:53.671 --> 01:28:56.171
- I want to see your identity card!
- What's happening?

700
01:28:56.381 --> 01:28:59.051
He's a Jew! A Jew!

701
01:28:59.261 --> 01:29:01.131
Stop the Jew!

702
01:29:02.141 --> 01:29:04.851
Don't let him out!
Stop him!

703
01:30:18.172 --> 01:30:22.423
- Yes?
- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

704
01:30:28.553 --> 01:30:32.603
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.
- Dorota.

705
01:30:33.893 --> 01:30:35.903
Come in.

706
01:30:42.902 --> 01:30:44.493
I'm sorry.

707
01:30:44.703 --> 01:30:48.203
I was given this address and
I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

708
01:30:48.413 --> 01:30:52.083
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

709
01:30:52.253 --> 01:30:54.003
Come in.

710
01:31:01.963 --> 01:31:03.973
Sit.

711
01:31:06.933 --> 01:31:09.304
I need help.

712
01:31:11.104 --> 01:31:14.024
He'll be back before curfew.

713
01:31:14.184 --> 01:31:16.814
I've been in hiding.

714
01:31:17.983 --> 01:31:21.523
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.

715
01:31:23.693 --> 01:31:26.863
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.

716
01:31:29.663 --> 01:31:32.294
And how is Jurek?

717
01:31:32.494 --> 01:31:34.204
Dead.

718
01:31:40.884 --> 01:31:44.714
- When is your baby due?
- Christmas.

719
01:31:45.384 --> 01:31:49.184
This is not a good time to
have children, but then...

720
01:31:51.434 --> 01:31:54.894
This is my husband.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.

721
01:31:55.064 --> 01:31:59.904
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Yes, I remember.

722
01:32:01.774 --> 01:32:04.484
He said to contact you
only in case of emergency.

723
01:32:04.694 --> 01:32:06.574
Don't worry now.

724
01:32:15.504 --> 01:32:19.755
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.

725
01:32:24.425 --> 01:32:26.265
Excuse me.

726
01:32:30.225 --> 01:32:33.265
I'm sorry,
could I have a piece of bread?

727
01:32:33.475 --> 01:32:36.225
Yes, of course.
We will eat.

728
01:32:36.895 --> 01:32:40.524
Sit. Please, sit.

729
01:32:40.734 --> 01:32:42.524
Thank you.

730
01:34:50.697 --> 01:34:53.747
You're on a very German area.

731
01:34:53.957 --> 01:34:58.377
On the opposite is a hospital taking
wounded from the Russian front.

732
01:35:00.247 --> 01:35:03.587
And next door is the
Schutzpolizei.

733
01:35:05.007 --> 01:35:07.338
Safest place to be.

734
01:35:07.548 --> 01:35:10.468
Right at the heart
of the lion's den.

735
01:35:15.558 --> 01:35:17.768
I'll be locking you in.

736
01:35:17.938 --> 01:35:21.978
No-one knows you're here,
so keep as quiet as possible.

737
01:37:31.570 --> 01:37:33.530
All well?

738
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:36.370
Thank you.

739
01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:44.420
This is Antek Szalas.
He'll be looking after you.

740
01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:46.420
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

741
01:37:46.590 --> 01:37:48.420
Thank you.

742
01:37:48.670 --> 01:37:53.631
I've given him a second key. He'll
bring food, see that you're alright.

743
01:37:54.141 --> 01:37:56.761
He's with the underground,
he's a good man.

744
01:38:00.851 --> 01:38:05.061
- You don't remember me?
- I don't think so.

745
01:38:05.271 --> 01:38:08.780
Warsaw Radio.
I was a technician.

746
01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:12.530
I saw you almost everyday.

747
01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:16.571
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.
- It doesn't matter.

748
01:38:18.831 --> 01:38:22.541
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.

749
01:38:23.371 --> 01:38:26.171
You'll be pleased to hear that
the Allies are bombing Germany...

750
01:38:26.331 --> 01:38:28.381
night after night,
after night.

751
01:38:28.591 --> 01:38:31.091
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

752
01:38:31.341 --> 01:38:34.631
And the Russians are giving them
hell. It's the beginning of the end.

753
01:38:34.841 --> 01:38:36.431
Let's hope so.

754
01:38:47.311 --> 01:38:49.521
Come here.

755
01:38:49.691 --> 01:38:51.901
Be careful with it.

756
01:38:52.821 --> 01:38:55.781
That's it. Be careful.

757
01:39:22.522 --> 01:39:25.392
Still alive then?

758
01:39:28.732 --> 01:39:32.902
Here. Sausage, bread.

759
01:39:33.112 --> 01:39:35.322
You still got that vodka?

760
01:39:49.672 --> 01:39:53.633
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long now.

761
01:39:54.173 --> 01:39:57.343
I think I've got jaundice.

762
01:39:57.553 --> 01:40:01.393
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.

763
01:40:02.473 --> 01:40:06.523
My grandfather was jilted by
his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

764
01:40:06.733 --> 01:40:08.642
Drink up.

765
01:40:09.482 --> 01:40:12.522
Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks...

766
01:40:12.732 --> 01:40:14.532
Problems.

767
01:40:14.732 --> 01:40:16.823
Money.

768
01:40:17.243 --> 01:40:19.863
I've got to raise money
to buy the food.

769
01:40:20.073 --> 01:40:23.953
I need things to sell,
it's not easy.

770
01:40:27.833 --> 01:40:30.503
Here. Sell this.

771
01:40:32.843 --> 01:40:35.053
Food is more important than time.

772
01:40:40.264 --> 01:40:43.394
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!
The Allies have landed in France.

773
01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:45.894
Russians will be here soon.

774
01:40:46.354 --> 01:40:49.353
They'll beat the
out of the Germans...

775
01:40:50.193 --> 01:40:52.233
any day now.

776
01:41:36.154 --> 01:41:38.194
Wladek?

777
01:41:47.494 --> 01:41:50.544
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

778
01:41:52.795 --> 01:41:55.135
- I'll get a doctor.
- You can't. It's too dangerous.

779
01:41:55.335 --> 01:41:59.015
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.
- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

780
01:41:59.175 --> 01:42:01.635
- He's still a doctor.
- No.

781
01:42:01.845 --> 01:42:05.055
You stay. I'll go.

782
01:42:38.175 --> 01:42:41.016
We came to say goodbye.

783
01:42:41.216 --> 01:42:44.226
We're going to stay
with my mother in Otwocks.

784
01:42:44.436 --> 01:42:47.766
The baby is already there.
It's safer.

785
01:42:47.936 --> 01:42:52.065
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.

786
01:42:53.355 --> 01:42:56.355
That man Szalas should be shot.

787
01:42:56.905 --> 01:43:01.075
He's been collecting money
on your behalf all over Warsaw.

788
01:43:01.865 --> 01:43:06.916
Apparently people gave generously,
so he collected a tidy sum.

789
01:43:11.246 --> 01:43:14.086
My God.

790
01:43:17.256 --> 01:43:22.596
The liver the size of a football.
Inflammation of the gall bladder...

791
01:43:23.266 --> 01:43:25.726
but he'll leave.

792
01:43:27.767 --> 01:43:32.017
I'll try to get him some laevulose,
but it's not easy.

793
01:43:32.227 --> 01:43:35.896
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows.

794
01:43:36.106 --> 01:43:40.236
- Doctor, thank you.
- Don't speak, rest.

795
01:43:43.786 --> 01:43:46.366
Thank you so much for coming.

796
01:43:47.996 --> 01:43:50.247
We've brought you some food.

797
01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:54.297
I'll prepare something now
for you, then we must go.

798
01:44:35.877 --> 01:44:38.218
I'll throw a grenade!

799
01:44:46.468 --> 01:44:49.018
There's a wounded man over there!

800
01:44:49.518 --> 01:44:52.058
Come.

801
01:44:52.188 --> 01:44:54.607
Watch out! Watch out!

802
01:44:55.727 --> 01:44:58.687
- I'll go get help!
- Hurry!

803
01:44:59.357 --> 01:45:03.368
Come on! Bring the litter!

804
01:45:07.198 --> 01:45:09.828
Go back inside!

805
01:46:58.899 --> 01:47:01.570
Get out, get out in the streets!

806
01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:05.570
Get out now! The Germans
have surrounded the building!

807
01:47:46.650 --> 01:47:50.951
Somebody...
Somebody help me!

808
01:48:48.842 --> 01:48:52.012
Are you alright?
There's too much dust.

809
01:48:52.392 --> 01:48:56.972
I'll check this side.
Don't worry.

810
01:48:57.182 --> 01:48:59.643
Be careful!

811
01:49:05.072 --> 01:49:07.742
- Heinrich?
- I'm checking!

812
01:49:10.282 --> 01:49:12.822
Is there anybody here?

813
01:49:16.912 --> 01:49:21.042
- Come on down!
- Alright, I'm coming.

814
01:53:29.257 --> 01:53:31.087
Come on, pile them up.

815
01:53:37.427 --> 01:53:39.637
Throw it.

816
01:55:03.889 --> 01:55:06.849
We have to mark everything.

817
01:55:07.898 --> 01:55:08.898
Come on.

818
02:02:10.076 --> 02:02:12.456
What are you doing here?

819
02:02:16.916 --> 02:02:19.256
Who are you?

820
02:02:23.376 --> 02:02:26.966
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

821
02:02:29.056 --> 02:02:31.347
What are you doing?

822
02:02:37.107 --> 02:02:39.106
I was...

823
02:02:39.226 --> 02:02:42.316
trying to open this can.

824
02:02:42.986 --> 02:02:45.656
Do you live here?

825
02:02:48.076 --> 02:02:50.036
Do you work here?

826
02:02:50.236 --> 02:02:51.946
No.

827
02:02:55.627 --> 02:02:58.127
What do you do for a living?

828
02:03:01.167 --> 02:03:02.967
I am...

829
02:03:04.587 --> 02:03:07.597
I was a pianist.

830
02:03:09.677 --> 02:03:11.927
Pianist?

831
02:03:30.697 --> 02:03:32.697
Come.

832
02:03:57.648 --> 02:03:59.897
Play something.

833
02:09:19.094 --> 02:09:21.894
Are you hiding here?

834
02:09:26.643 --> 02:09:28.313
Jew?

835
02:09:31.313 --> 02:09:33.733
Where are you hiding yourself?

836
02:09:35.363 --> 02:09:37.363
In the attic.

837
02:09:40.614 --> 02:09:42.954
Show it to me.

838
02:10:06.435 --> 02:10:08.724
Have you got anything to eat?

839
02:10:55.065 --> 02:11:00.655
According to them,
it's very important that...

840
02:11:07.375 --> 02:11:09.165
Attention!

841
02:11:10.875 --> 02:11:13.926
- At ease.
- At ease.

842
02:12:19.156 --> 02:12:21.156
Jew?

843
02:12:35.587 --> 02:12:37.047
Please.

844
02:12:37.467 --> 02:12:39.507
What does it mean,
all that shooting?

845
02:12:40.047 --> 02:12:42.807
The Russians,
on the other side of the river.

846
02:12:44.177 --> 02:12:47.637
You just have to hold on
a couple of weeks, not more.

847
02:14:19.148 --> 02:14:21.948
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.

848
02:14:24.869 --> 02:14:28.199
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

849
02:14:31.119 --> 02:14:34.999
I don't know how to thank you.

850
02:14:36.459 --> 02:14:38.669
Thank God, not me.

851
02:14:39.089 --> 02:14:44.719
He wants us to survive. At least,
we have to believe in that.

852
02:14:54.559 --> 02:14:57.899
Here. Take it.

853
02:14:58.939 --> 02:15:03.239
- And you?
- I have another one. Warmer.

854
02:15:07.659 --> 02:15:11.249
What are you going to do
when this is over?

855
02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:17.420
I'll play piano again at
the Polish radio station.

856
02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:20.090
Tell me your name.

857
02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:22.970
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.

858
02:15:23.130 --> 02:15:25.260
Szpilman.

859
02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:32.350
Perfect name for a pianist.

860
02:16:54.602 --> 02:16:57.271
German! German!

861
02:17:20.422 --> 02:17:23.092
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!

862
02:17:24.092 --> 02:17:26.132
I'm Polish!

863
02:17:26.922 --> 02:17:29.632
- Come out with your hands up!
- Please! I beg of you!

864
02:17:30.342 --> 02:17:35.012
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
I beg you, I'm a Polish.

865
02:17:35.223 --> 02:17:37.232
Come down!

866
02:17:40.772 --> 02:17:44.902
Please, I'm Polish.
Please.

867
02:17:45.112 --> 02:17:47.282
He's Polish.

868
02:17:50.152 --> 02:17:52.412
Yes, he's Polish.

869
02:17:53.662 --> 02:17:56.122
Why the coat?

870
02:17:57.202 --> 02:17:59.463
I'm cold.

871
02:18:18.472 --> 02:18:21.482
Look at them.
German.

872
02:18:22.022 --> 02:18:25.063
Murderers! Murderers!

873
02:18:25.313 --> 02:18:28.533
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!

874
02:18:28.733 --> 02:18:32.203
- Bastards!
- Look at you now!

875
02:18:32.363 --> 02:18:36.333
You took everything I had.
Me, a musician.

876
02:18:36.533 --> 02:18:39.953
You took my violin,
you took my soul.

877
02:18:44.833 --> 02:18:46.503
Musician?

878
02:18:47.714 --> 02:18:49.674
Are you a musician?

879
02:18:50.634 --> 02:18:52.804
Do you know...

880
02:18:53.134 --> 02:18:56.304
a pianist called Szpilman,
from the Polish radio station?

881
02:18:56.514 --> 02:19:01.733
- Of course I know him.
- I helped him to hide himself.

882
02:19:02.523 --> 02:19:04.653
Tell him I'm here.

883
02:19:05.443 --> 02:19:07.613
Ask him to help me.

884
02:19:10.694 --> 02:19:13.454
- What's your name?
- Hosenfeld.

885
02:19:13.704 --> 02:19:14.914
What?

886
02:20:56.976 --> 02:20:59.596
It was here, I'm certain of it.

887
02:21:01.605 --> 02:21:03.765
Well, it's not here now.

888
02:21:03.975 --> 02:21:08.105
I shouted, abused them. I'm not
proud of it, but that's what I did.

889
02:21:08.355 --> 02:21:09.776
I stood where you are now.

890
02:21:10.986 --> 02:21:14.326
There was a barbed wire
and this German came up to me.

891
02:21:15.656 --> 02:21:19.326
- You didn't catch his name?
- No.

892
02:21:21.496 --> 02:21:24.796
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.
