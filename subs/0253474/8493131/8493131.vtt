Jurek, where have you been hiding her?

No, no, no,
it's a little cut, it's nothing.

Oh, I've been worried sick.

34
00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:17.249
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

35
00:03:17.332 --> 00:03:19.249
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd have known where to take you.

-P*. Out of Warsaw.

-[Regina] You haven't heard?

47

-Heard what?
-Haven't you seen the paper?

48
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.041

-I used it for packing.

There's hardly anybody left in this
building only the women the men have gone.

55
00:03:59.082 --> 00:04:01.957
And what do you think you’ll do while
you're setting up a new line of defense?

56
00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:05.916
-Wonder around lugging your suitcases?
-[mother] Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

57
00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:09.916
-I'm not going anywhere.
-Good! I'm not going anywhere either!

we've got to keep together.

AII will be well.

-[all] Hey!
-[father] Oh! [laughs]

79
00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:50.874
Five thousand and three.

80
00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:54.166
Is that all?

81
00:05:54.582 --> 00:05:57.082
Yes, five thousand and three zlotys,
that's all we've got left.

82
00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:59.832
It's three thousand and three
zlotys too much. Look...

-[mother] What do we do with the rest?
-Deposit it in a bank. A blocked account.

86
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:16.207
Banks? Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

87
00:06:16.291 --> 00:06:21.291
We could hide the money. Look here. We can
hide the money under the flowerpot.

88
00:06:21.374 --> 00:06:24.374
No, no, no. I’ll tell you what we’ll do.
We’ll use tried and tested methods.

You know what we did in the last war?

90
00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:29.499
We made a hole in the table leg...
[taps the table leg]

92

-And suppose they take the table away?
-What do you mean take the table away?

93
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:36.249
The Germans go into Jewish homes
and they just take what they want...

94
00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:38.541
furniture, valuables, anything.

95
00:06:38.624 --> 00:06:40.416
-[mother] Do they?
-Idiot! What would they want with a table.

96
00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:41.374
Hey? A table like this?

-What on earth are you doing?
-No, listen, look.

[Halina] This is the best place for it.

100
00:06:47.582 --> 00:06:49.582
[Halina] No-one would think of looking
under the flowerpot.

101
00:06:50.082 --> 00:06:51.916
No, no. No, no.
Listen, listen, I've been thinking--

102
00:06:52.082 --> 00:06:53.416
Oh! Really? That's a change.

103
00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:56.291
-You know what we do? We use psychology.
-[Wladek] We use what?

104
00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:58.749
We leave the money
and the watch on the table...

105
00:06:59.374 --> 00:07:01.624
and we cover it like this. In full view.

[Halina laughs]

107
00:07:04.207 --> 00:07:05.166
Are you stupid?

108
00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:07.624
The Germans will search high and low,
I promise you, they’ll never notice.

109
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:11.207
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
Of course, they’ll notice it. Look.

110
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:15.666
Look here... Idiot.

111
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:17.541
[Henryk laughs] And you call me stupid.

112
00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:19.499
No, that is very good
because that is the last place--

113
00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:22.041
-This would take hours.
-We are not in a hurry. We'd get it back.

114
00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:24.124
-It won't take hours.
-How will you get them out? Tell me that!

115
00:07:24.207 --> 00:07:26.041
Tell me that, I would like to know.
How would you get them out?

116
00:07:26.124 --> 00:07:27.749
-Why do you resist?
-[Regina] Quiet! Order, please!

117
00:07:27.916 --> 00:07:29.666
-You take each one out individually.
-[Regina] Order please!

118
00:07:29.832 --> 00:07:31.291
No-one listens to me, no one listens.

119
00:07:31.457 --> 00:07:34.374
Quiet, please, quiet!
Order, order, please!

120
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:38.374
-She's a lawyer, she likes order.
-Listen, just listen. Look,

121
00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:41.749
the watch we put under the flowerpots
and the money we stuff in the violin.

122
00:07:43.374 --> 00:07:44.499
Um...

123
00:07:44.666 --> 00:07:48.666
-Will I still be able to play?
-Well, you’ll find out.

124
00:07:49.457 --> 00:07:53.249
-Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
<i>- Wladek, how are you?</i>

125
00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:56.291
Fine, fine, we're fine, thank you.
And you?

126
00:07:56.666 --> 00:08:00.999
<i>Elne, we're fine under the circumstances.
But I guess what you've called about.</i>

127
00:08:01.082 --> 00:08:03.499
<i>There’s nothing we can do.
They won't re-open the station.</i>

128
00:08:03.582 --> 00:08:05.041
<i>Just won't re-Open the station.</i>

129
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:07.124
Yes, I know, but um, Jurek--

130
00:08:07.207 --> 00:08:09.624
<i>Not even music, nothing,
no radios nor the roles.</i>

131
00:08:09.707 --> 00:08:10.541
I know, Jurek!

132
00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:13.791
<i>But I'm sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you Wladek</i>

133
00:08:13.957 --> 00:08:16.374
Well, maybe, maybe not, but um...

134
00:08:16.957 --> 00:08:21.166
Listen, don't be offended, but I didn't
call to discuss my future career.

135
00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:25.166
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last, he gave in and said...

136
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:28.666
"AII right, come with me tomorrow",
And so I came and...

137
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:30.666
they bombed the station.

138
00:08:31.499 --> 00:08:33.541
I tell you, meeting you like that
was absolutely wonderful.

139
00:08:34.124 --> 00:08:38.124
-Really?
-Yes, it was... It was unforgettable.

140
00:08:39.249 --> 00:08:41.207
I've always loved your playing,
Mr. Szpilman.

141
00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:42.332
Call me Wladek, please.

142
00:08:42.416 --> 00:08:45.374
-No-one plays Chopin like you.
-I hope that's a compliment.

143
00:08:45.832 --> 00:08:49.541
-Of course, I mean it.
-I was... trying to be funny.

144
00:08:50.374 --> 00:08:52.249
Shall we go to the Paradiso,
have a coffee?

145
00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:53.666
I'd like that.

146
00:08:55.457 --> 00:08:59.416
-And you, what do you do?
-I finished with the conservatoire.

147
00:08:59.499 --> 00:09:02.416
-You're a musician?
-Yes. But only just.

148
00:09:02.666 --> 00:09:04.291
-What instrument?
-The cello.

149
00:09:05.416 --> 00:09:07.332
I love to see a women playing the cello.

00:09:12.457 --> 00:09:15.499
This is disgraceful. How dare they?

153
00:09:16.041 --> 00:09:18.791
You know what people are like,
they want to be better Nazis than Hitler.

154
00:09:18.874 --> 00:09:22.582
-I'm going in there to complain.
-No. It's better not, believe me.

155
00:09:23.082 --> 00:09:26.416
-It's so humiliating. Someone like you!
-[woman] Good-bye!

156
00:09:31.082 --> 00:09:32.332
We’ll find somewhere else.

157
00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:36.249
-[Dorota] We can walk in the park.
-No, we can't.

158
00:09:36.957 --> 00:09:40.457
It's an official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

159
00:09:41.124 --> 00:09:43.874
-My God. Are you joking?
-I'm not joking, it's true.

160
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:47.124
I suggest we just sit on a bench somewhere
but that's another official decree,

161
00:09:47.207 --> 00:09:48.707
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

162
00:09:49.082 --> 00:09:50.541
This is absurd!

163
00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:54.041
I’ll tell you what we can do.
We can just stand here and talk.

164
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:56.624
I think we're allowed to do that,
don't you?

165
00:09:57.916 --> 00:10:00.332
So, you play the cello Dorota.
That's nice.

166
00:10:00.957 --> 00:10:04.832
And who's your favorite composer?
Chopin? Really? Well...

167
00:10:05.291 --> 00:10:07.749
you’ll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

168
00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:10.874
And what about you, Wladek? Well...

169
00:10:11.124 --> 00:10:13.791
Perhaps I could accompany you.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

170
00:10:14.374 --> 00:10:17.624
Oh, Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

171
00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:22.416
Call me Wladek, please.

172
00:10:22.832 --> 00:10:25.999
"Re: emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district.

173
00:10:26.541 --> 00:10:29.666
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

174
00:10:29.749 --> 00:10:32.749
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

175
00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:38.082
This decree will come into force
on the 1st of December, 1939...

176
00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:41.166
and applies to all Jews
over 1 2 years of age.

177
00:10:41.957 --> 00:10:44.832
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

178
00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:49.166
and will represent a blue star
of David on a white background.

179
00:10:49.832 --> 00:10:52.916
The background must
be sufficiently large...

180
00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:56.749
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

181
00:10:57.374 --> 00:11:01.041
The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

Dr. Fischer."

184

I won't wear it.

185
00:11:16.249 --> 00:11:18.832
I won't wear it.
I'm not going to be branded.

186
00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:24.707
[clears throat] Let, let me see this.

187
00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:33.082
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

188
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:36.791
-Where will we get them?
-We're not going to get them.

189
00:11:36.874 --> 00:11:38.874
We're not going to wear them!

[in German] Come here.

193
00:11:58.832 --> 00:12:00.666
[in German] Why didn't you bow?

194
00:12:02.082 --> 00:12:03.541
[in German] I beg your pardon.

195
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:05.416
[father groans]

196
00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:16.541
[in German]
You're forbidden to walk on the pavement.

197
00:12:17.749 --> 00:12:19.249
[in German] Walk in the gutter!

198
00:12:36.291 --> 00:12:40.249
-Have you seen this?
-What, what, what? I'm working. What?

199
00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:43.332
What is it?

200
00:12:44.874 --> 00:12:47.791
-That's where they're going to put us.
-What do you mean, put us?

"By order of the governor of the
Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

203
00:12:58.457 --> 00:13:02.082
There will be created a Jewish district
in which all Jews living in Warsaw

204

or moving to Warsaw will have to reside."

205

Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area

206
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:14.291
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31st of October, 1 940."

207
00:13:15.707 --> 00:13:20.124
They won't get all of us. It's too small.
There's 400 thousand of us in Warsaw.

208
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:23.166
No, 360 thousand. So it will be easy.

What am I supposed to do? Hm? You tell me.

210

[mother crying] You're a clever man,
you’ll tell me what I will buy.

211

[father] I do my best.

Mama, what is it?

214
00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:39.707
[mother cries] 20 zlotys!

215
00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:44.416
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

216
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:50.874
What, what can I buy with 20 zlotys?

217
00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:56.249
I am sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

218
00:14:04.457 --> 00:14:06.791
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

219
00:14:06.874 --> 00:14:09.749
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

220
00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:13.749
-But, it's a Bechstein, Mr. Lipa!
-Two thousand. My advice is to take it.

221
00:14:14.124 --> 00:14:16.332
[Mr. Lipa] What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

222
00:14:17.624 --> 00:14:20.124
-Get out!
-Hey! What's the matter with you?

223
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:22.332
-Stop it!
-We'd rather give it away. Go on, get out!

224
00:14:22.416 --> 00:14:24.874
Haven't you eaten today? Hm?
What are you suffering from?

225
00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:27.666
You people are crazy.

226
00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:32.874
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

227
00:14:32.957 --> 00:14:34.749
I'm not even charging for the removal!

228
00:14:36.624 --> 00:14:38.791
You haven't eaten today. You're crazy.

229
00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:40.291
Take it.

230
00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:16.499
[Wladek] Hello.

231
00:15:18.582 --> 00:15:19.832
Hello. Hi.

232
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:24.416
I didn't want to come.

233
00:15:25.249 --> 00:15:29.916
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

234
00:15:30.082 --> 00:15:32.249
-How are you doing?
-Fine.

235
00:15:32.332 --> 00:15:33.499
Good.

236
00:15:34.457 --> 00:15:37.374
No, not really. They arrested my cousin.

237
00:15:38.332 --> 00:15:40.249
Jurek says they’ll let him out.

238
00:15:41.999 --> 00:15:46.124
-This is disgraceful.
-It won't last long. Don't worry.

239
00:15:46.707 --> 00:15:48.791
That's what I said myself.

240
00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:51.707
It's too absurd.

241
00:15:56.707 --> 00:15:59.291
I ah... I should go.

242
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:04.207
Well, I’ll, I’ll see you...

243
00:16:05.166 --> 00:16:06.166
soon.

244
00:16:10.957 --> 00:16:12.124
Goodbye.

245
00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:28.916
Well...

246
00:16:29.666 --> 00:16:33.457
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

247
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.916
-Where will we sleep?
-I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

248
00:16:44.582 --> 00:16:47.082
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

249
00:16:49.166 --> 00:16:50.374
Look.

250
00:16:52.332 --> 00:16:53.707
Come and look.

-Sell anything?
-Just one. Dostoyevsky, <i>The Idiot.</i>

-Three zlotys.
-It's better than yesterday.

257
00:17:57.999 --> 00:18:02.332
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

258
00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:04.874
-I know.
-You don't know, believe me.

259
00:18:05.541 --> 00:18:08.499
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

260
00:18:08.957 --> 00:18:13.749
They're bringing in cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

261
00:18:13.999 --> 00:18:15.832
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a damn.

262
00:18:15.999 --> 00:18:19.791
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

263
00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:24.124
A tall, a tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard... No?

264
00:18:24.374 --> 00:18:29.041
-I'm afraid not.
-Excuse me. Goodbye.

265
00:18:29.124 --> 00:18:32.832
Sleep well. But, but, but if you see him,
write to me, yes?

266
00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:35.082
Izaak Szerman.

[tram bell rings]

268
00:18:49.957 --> 00:18:53.332
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

269
00:18:53.416 --> 00:18:55.249
Why can't they go around?

270
00:18:55.749 --> 00:18:59.457
Don't worry about it. They're about
to build a bridge. Haven't you heard?

271
00:19:00.374 --> 00:19:02.541
A bridge, a bridge a smedge.

272

The Germans claim to be intelligent.

273
00:19:06.332 --> 00:19:09.624
But do you know what I think?
I think they are totally stupid.

274
00:19:10.207 --> 00:19:13.666
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here

275
00:19:13.749 --> 00:19:15.707
waiting for them to let us through.

276
00:19:16.374 --> 00:19:19.124

here to listen to the music?

-What's this about?
-[mother] Sit down, have tea.

297
00:21:02.832 --> 00:21:05.249
[mother] I’ll start lunch
when the girls get here.

298
00:21:11.499 --> 00:21:14.541
-[Henryk] So, what are you doing here?
-[father] He brought cakes.

299
00:21:14.624 --> 00:21:18.332
His ah... his father's back
in the jewelry business.

300
00:21:18.416 --> 00:21:20.332
He's, uh, doing well, hey, Yitzchak, hey?

301
00:21:21.374 --> 00:21:22.332
[father chuckles]

302
00:21:23.124 --> 00:21:24.749
[father] Amazing, jewelry.

303
00:21:25.874 --> 00:21:27.999
-We're recruiting.
-Who is recruiting?

304
00:21:28.082 --> 00:21:30.207
Don't be clever with me, Henryk.
I'm coming as a friend.

305
00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:32.957
[Heller] They're bringing Jews
in from all over the country.

306
00:21:33.124 --> 00:21:34.916
Soon there will be half million
people in the ghetto.

307
00:21:35.332 --> 00:21:39.249
-We need more Jewish police.
-Oh! More Jewish police!

308
00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:43.082
You mean you want me to beat up Jews with
my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit.

309
00:21:43.249 --> 00:21:44.957
-[Henryk] I see!
-Someone's got to do it, Henryk.

310
00:21:45.041 --> 00:21:45.832
[Henryk] But why me?

311
00:21:45.999 --> 00:21:48.416
I thought you only recruited
boys with rich fathers.

312
00:21:48.666 --> 00:21:50.832
Look at my father, look at us, I mean.

313
00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:52.541
Yes, I'm looking at you,
that's why I'm here.

314
00:21:52.624 --> 00:21:53.957
Your whole family can have a better life.

315
00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:56.416
You want to go on struggling for survival,
selling books on the street?

316
00:21:56.499 --> 00:21:57.624
Yes, please.

317
00:21:57.791 --> 00:22:00.457
[scoffs] I'm doing you people a favor.

318
00:22:01.666 --> 00:22:03.874
What about you, Wladek?
You're a great pianist.

319
00:22:03.957 --> 00:22:05.541
And we've got an excellent
police jazz band.

320
00:22:05.707 --> 00:22:07.291
They'd welcome you with open arms.
Join us!

321
00:22:07.374 --> 00:22:09.666
-[Heller] You've got no work.
-Thank you, I've got work.

323
00:22:53.499 --> 00:22:55.499
[indistinct conversation]

324
00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:57.166
Yes of course!

325
00:22:59.457 --> 00:23:01.332
I'm sorry, Wladek, he wants you to stop.

326
00:23:03.874 --> 00:23:05.249
[continues playing]
Who wants me to stop?

327
00:23:14.207 --> 00:23:16.207
[Wladek stops playing]
[noisy indistinct chatter continues]

328
00:23:42.416 --> 00:23:44.416
[Wladek continues playing]

329
00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:53.666
[small dog barks]

330
00:23:57.624 --> 00:23:59.291
[Jehuda] I always say,
Look on the bright side.

331
00:23:59.749 --> 00:24:02.916
[Jehuda] You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

332
00:24:02.999 --> 00:24:06.749
[Jehuda] You're better off than us.
Here in the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

333
00:24:06.832 --> 00:24:08.207
Jehuda, give me something to do.

334
00:24:08.374 --> 00:24:12.374
You're an artist, Wladek. You keep
peoples' spirits up. You do enough.

335
00:24:12.457 --> 00:24:15.832
-I want to help, I want to do something.
-You're too well known, Wladek.

336
00:24:16.166 --> 00:24:21.332
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

337
00:24:21.416 --> 00:24:25.499
You're too... too... musical.
[laughs]

338
00:24:31.332 --> 00:24:32.541
-Who is that?
-Symche.

339
00:24:32.624 --> 00:24:33.749
[Symche] Majorek.

340
00:24:35.666 --> 00:24:39.207
[Wladek] There are notices going up.
City is to be cleansed of undesirables.

341
00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:42.291
-No notices going up.
-[Majorek] Hello, Symche.

342
00:24:43.291 --> 00:24:46.166
Dolek... Mrs. Zyskind.

343
00:24:48.332 --> 00:24:50.374
[Majorek] Jehuda, working hard?

344
00:24:50.457 --> 00:24:54.666
Majorek. This is the greatest pianist
in Poland. Maybe the whole world.

345
00:24:54.749 --> 00:24:57.082
Wladyslaw Szpilman, meet Majorek.

346
00:24:57.332 --> 00:24:59.791
-How do you do?
-I know your name.

347
00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:03.541
-I've never heard you play.
-[Jehuda] Majorek used to be in the Army.

348
00:25:04.166 --> 00:25:07.791
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

349
00:25:07.874 --> 00:25:09.457
[Jehuda laughs]

350
00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:12.582
[Jehuda] You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

351
00:25:14.416 --> 00:25:16.582
[Jehuda] You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

352
00:25:17.749 --> 00:25:18.999
[Jehuda] Five hundred.

353
00:25:19.749 --> 00:25:23.207
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

354
00:25:23.291 --> 00:25:27.874
That makes ten thousand readers.
These will start the uprising.

355
00:25:27.957 --> 00:25:31.166
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

356
00:25:31.582 --> 00:25:33.832
-Toilets, huh?
-As many toilets as I can find.

357
00:25:34.582 --> 00:25:36.457
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

358
00:25:37.332 --> 00:25:40.082
-They're too clean for them.
-[Jehuda laughs]

359

[screaming continues]

371
00:26:27.374 --> 00:26:28.166
[Wladek] Stop it!

372
00:26:31.582 --> 00:26:34.832
[Wladek] Come on, come on, come on.
Come on boy.

373
00:26:36.874 --> 00:26:38.874
[man speaks in German]

374
00:26:40.874 --> 00:26:43.499

[footsteps approach]

379
00:27:14.874 --> 00:27:19.416
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

380
00:27:19.499 --> 00:27:22.791
-Enjoy our meal.
-Fine, then I’ll tell you something funny.

381
00:27:23.207 --> 00:27:24.707
You all know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?

382
00:27:24.874 --> 00:27:26.249
-The surgeon.
-[Henryk] The surgeon.

383
00:27:26.624 --> 00:27:28.541
[Henryk] Well, for some reason,
don't ask me why,

384
00:27:28.999 --> 00:27:31.582
the Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

385
00:27:31.666 --> 00:27:34.957
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

386
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:38.291
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so he...

387
00:27:38.374 --> 00:27:40.707
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

388
00:27:40.999 --> 00:27:43.541
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

389
00:27:44.124 --> 00:27:45.624
shoot the patient lying on the table,

390
00:27:45.707 --> 00:27:48.291
then Dr. Raszeja and everybody
else who was there.

391
00:27:50.416 --> 00:27:51.332
Isn't that a laugh?

392
00:27:53.916 --> 00:27:57.041
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized. [laughs]

393
00:27:57.332 --> 00:27:59.207
I said nothing bad, Henryk.

394
00:27:59.832 --> 00:28:03.666
What's the matter with you all, huh?
Huh? You lost your sense of humor?

395
00:28:04.707 --> 00:28:05.874
It's not funny.

396
00:28:06.332 --> 00:28:10.124
Well, you know what's funny?
You're funny, with that ridiculous tie.

397
00:28:11.457 --> 00:28:14.499
What are you talking about my tie for?
What's my tie have to do with anything?

398
00:28:14.666 --> 00:28:16.999
-[Wladek] I need this tie for my work.
-Your work?

399
00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:19.291
-Yes, that's right, I work.
-Yes, yes, your work.

400
00:28:19.374 --> 00:28:21.416
Playing the piano for all
the parasites in the ghetto.

401
00:28:21.582 --> 00:28:22.791
-Parasites?
-Parasites.

402
00:28:22.957 --> 00:28:24.249
Boys. Boys!

403
00:28:24.332 --> 00:28:25.749
They don't give a damn
about people's sufferings.

404
00:28:25.832 --> 00:28:27.416
And you blame me for their apathy, right?

405
00:28:27.499 --> 00:28:29.332
I do because I see it every day.

406
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:31.291
They don't even notice
what's going around them.

407
00:28:31.374 --> 00:28:33.457
-I blame the Americans.
-For what? For my tie?

408
00:28:33.957 --> 00:28:36.249
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

409
00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:39.582
What have they done for us, hey?
What do they think they're doing?

410
00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:42.541
People here are dying.
Haven't got a bite to eat.

411
00:28:44.082 --> 00:28:46.207
The Jewish bankers over there
should be persuading America

412
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:47.832
to declare war on Germany.

They've got my grandson in there.
They pick them up, they take them away.

00:36:12.332 --> 00:36:13.582
What did you pay him?

492
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:17.957
With what, with what could I pay him?
With what?

493
00:36:18.041 --> 00:36:20.207
Every zloty I earn we spend on food.

494
00:36:20.291 --> 00:36:23.457
-I can look after myself.
-They were taking you away.

495
00:36:23.541 --> 00:36:27.332
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

496
00:36:27.582 --> 00:36:30.499
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

497
00:36:31.082 --> 00:36:32.999
You're mad. That's,
that's your trouble, is your mad.

498
00:36:33.082 --> 00:36:34.999
That's also my business.

[tram bell rings]

500
00:36:42.082 --> 00:36:47.124
Hey, hey! What's the matter?
What's the matter? Are you sick?

501
00:36:48.749 --> 00:36:50.207
Hungry.

502
00:36:54.624 --> 00:36:56.499
[doorman] Mr. Szpilman!

503
00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:02.666
Employment certificate? What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

504
00:37:02.916 --> 00:37:05.874
You have to have an
employment certificate...

505
00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:08.749
to work for one of the German firms
in the ghetto, otherwise...

506
00:37:08.916 --> 00:37:11.707
-Otherwise, what?
-[Henryk] You'll be deported.

507
00:37:11.791 --> 00:37:15.041
-So, the rumors were true.
-[Henryk] They're going to resettle us...

508
00:37:16.166 --> 00:37:18.832
and send us to Iabor camps, in the East.

509
00:37:21.207 --> 00:37:23.666
-And they're closing the small ghetto.
-My God!

[indistinct chatter]

511
00:37:39.582 --> 00:37:41.541
[Jehuda] Wladek? Wladek?

512
00:37:42.499 --> 00:37:46.499
I thought you'd be off on tour playing
London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

513
00:37:46.582 --> 00:37:48.416
-Not this week.
-You look terrible.

514
00:37:49.749 --> 00:37:52.582
Have you heard the rumors?
They're going to resettle us in the East.

515
00:37:52.666 --> 00:37:56.707
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart Wladek. What's the trouble?

516
00:37:57.124 --> 00:38:00.749
I, I've been trying to get the
certificate of employment for my father.

517
00:38:01.499 --> 00:38:03.707
But I managed to get one for me
and the rest of my family,

518
00:38:03.791 --> 00:38:05.166
but I need another one for my father.

519
00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:07.749
-I've been to all the firms and shops...
-Why didn't you come to me?

520
00:38:08.749 --> 00:38:10.832
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

521
00:38:10.916 --> 00:38:12.582
I'm not, but Majorek is.

522
00:38:15.624 --> 00:38:17.541
Can you help? I have no money.

523
00:38:17.624 --> 00:38:21.082
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

524
00:38:21.624 --> 00:38:24.124
Be at the Schultz workshop tomorrow,
four o'clock.

525
00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:27.082
You see what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

526
00:38:27.166 --> 00:38:31.124
That's the historical imperative
in action! That's why I always say:

527
00:38:31.207 --> 00:38:33.749
-Look on the bright side!
-The bright side, yes, I know.

529
00:38:46.707 --> 00:38:49.041
-[Majorek] How's your back?
-Better.

530
00:38:49.499 --> 00:38:50.499
Better?

531
00:38:51.666 --> 00:38:53.207
Better not ask!

532
00:39:06.666 --> 00:39:12.041
-Thank you.
-My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

533

534
00:39:14.207 --> 00:39:15.749

00:40:27.707 --> 00:40:29.791
Well, at least we got work in the ghetto.
Hey?

540
00:40:31.666 --> 00:40:33.166
At least we are still together.

Go over there. Hurry.

552

[German NCO in German] You.

553
00:41:11.999 --> 00:41:14.332
[German NCO in German] You. You.

554
00:41:16.499 --> 00:41:17.499
[German NCO in German] You.

555
00:41:19.874 --> 00:41:20.999
[German NCO in German] You.

556
00:41:23.291 --> 00:41:24.416

get dressed and report back here!

561
00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:09.374
I'm sorry, I did my best.

562
00:42:12.707 --> 00:42:14.541
I thought the certificates would save us.

563
00:42:14.707 --> 00:42:15.707
Stop it, Wladek.

564
00:42:15.791 --> 00:42:19.291

-You're going to work.

570
00:42:49.666 --> 00:42:52.749
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

585
00:44:06.916 --> 00:44:09.332
-I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
-I can hear you.

586
00:44:09.416 --> 00:44:11.957
[Dr. Szpilman] We're letting them take us
to our death like sheep to the slaughter.

587
00:44:12.041 --> 00:44:13.916
-Not so loud.
-[Dr. Szpilman] Why don't we attack them?

588
00:44:14.457 --> 00:44:17.041
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

589
00:44:17.791 --> 00:44:20.457
At least we can die honorably,
not as a stain on the face of history.

590
00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:22.791
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

591
00:44:22.874 --> 00:44:25.874
I'm not sure. You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

592
00:44:26.457 --> 00:44:27.999
But I'm telling you,
they're going to wipe us all out.

593
00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:30.666
Dr. Ehrlich, what do you want me to do?
Do you want me to fight?

594
00:44:30.749 --> 00:44:33.416
To fight, you need organization,
plans, guns.

595
00:44:33.499 --> 00:44:36.416
[father] He's right. What do you think I
can do? Fight them with my violin bow?

596
00:44:36.582 --> 00:44:39.166
The Germans would never squander
a huge Iabor force like this.

597
00:44:39.957 --> 00:44:41.832
They're sending us to a Iabor camp,
it's obvious.

598
00:44:41.916 --> 00:44:42.999
Oh, sure.

599
00:44:43.457 --> 00:44:46.416
Look at that cripple there,
look at the old people, the children.

600
00:44:46.499 --> 00:44:47.499
They're going to work?

601
00:44:48.124 --> 00:44:51.291

iron girders on your back?

611

-What did she do, for God's sake?
-She smothered her baby.

612
00:46:23.957 --> 00:46:27.082
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

613
00:46:28.166 --> 00:46:30.749
But the baby cried
just as the police came.

614
00:46:31.166 --> 00:46:35.124
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

you're going to do with the money?

Zygmunt, a good man.

[knock on bathroom door]
[door opens]

831
01:13:39.207 --> 01:13:40.416
We must hurry.

832
01:13:41.249 --> 01:13:42.624
Here. See if these fit.

833
01:13:43.624 --> 01:13:45.291
[Bogucki]
We're going to have to keep moving you.

834
01:13:45.457 --> 01:13:47.957
The Germans are hunting
down indiscriminately now.

835
01:13:48.041 --> 01:13:51.249
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

836
01:13:51.332 --> 01:13:55.332
And Wladek, you'd better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

837
01:14:10.249 --> 01:14:12.291
You’ll be looked after
by Marek Gebczynski.

838
01:14:13.374 --> 01:14:14.957
He's on the other side of town.

839
01:14:15.541 --> 01:14:18.166
You stay there tonight,
then we’ll find you somewhere else.

840
01:14:20.207 --> 01:14:23.624
-I’ll bring you food.
-Alright, let's go.

841
01:14:28.332 --> 01:14:30.332
[melancholic orchestral music]

842
01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:05.707
I’ll show you where
you're going to sleep.

843
01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:39.707
You have to stay here
until tomorrow afternoon.

844
01:15:40.249 --> 01:15:44.791
We have a flat for you near
the ghetto wall. But it's safe.

845
01:15:52.374 --> 01:15:54.416
It's not going to be very comfortable.

846
01:15:55.416 --> 01:15:56.332
I’ll be fine.

847
01:16:06.957 --> 01:16:08.166
Thank you.

848

[tram bell rings]

849
01:16:24.999 --> 01:16:27.374
I’ll take it. Here. Give it to me.

850
01:16:28.374 --> 01:16:31.416
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

851
01:16:50.457 --> 01:16:51.749
DO NOT PASS

852
01:16:57.374 --> 01:16:59.332
[tram bell rings]

853
01:17:23.499 --> 01:17:25.291
[Gebczynski]
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

854
01:17:31.541 --> 01:17:34.541
But you leave them open
during the daytime. Don't forget.

855
01:17:38.249 --> 01:17:41.041
Must feel better on
this side of the wall, huh?

856
01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:42.791
Yes.

857
01:17:44.541 --> 01:17:47.749
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

858
01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:53.957
[Gebczynski] Some bread, potatoes, onions.

859
01:17:54.791 --> 01:17:58.332
I’ll come again. And Janina Bogucki
will visit twice a week.

860
01:17:58.416 --> 01:18:00.499
Bring more food, see how you are.

861
01:18:01.291 --> 01:18:02.374
Thank you.

862
01:18:04.582 --> 01:18:09.124
Oh, this is very important.
In case of emergency...

863
01:18:09.207 --> 01:18:12.707
I mean emergency,
go to this address.

864
01:18:18.832 --> 01:18:20.832

[pigeon flies away]

917

[Janina] No-one thought
they'd hold out so long.

918
01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:01.416
I never should have come out. I should've
stayed there and fought with them.

919
01:23:01.499 --> 01:23:04.957
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

920
01:23:05.041 --> 01:23:07.082
Just be proud it happened.

921

-Yes.

922

-So did the Germans.
-They're in shock!

923
01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:22.166
They didn't expect it.
Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back?

-What good did it do?

Wladek, I'm surprised at you.

927

They died with dignity,
that's what good it did.

928
01:23:36.166 --> 01:23:37.207
And you know something else?

929
01:23:38.207 --> 01:23:41.874
Now the Poles will rise. We're ready.

-[Gebczynski] I'm on the run.
-What's happened?

935
01:24:10.624 --> 01:24:14.624
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

936
01:24:15.624 --> 01:24:19.749
They're bound to find out about this
place too. You must get away at once.

937
01:24:19.916 --> 01:24:21.124
Where do you want me to go?

938
01:24:22.207 --> 01:24:24.999
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

939
01:24:26.791 --> 01:24:29.541

01:31:58.999 --> 01:31:59.999
Don't worry now.

1003
01:32:10.041 --> 01:32:13.166
We can't move you tonight.
You’ll sleep on the sofa.

1004
01:32:18.082 --> 01:32:19.874
Oh! Excuse me.

1005
01:32:24.457 --> 01:32:26.791
I'm sorry, could I,
could I have a piece of bread?

1006
01:32:27.707 --> 01:32:29.624
Yes, of course. We’ll eat.

1007
01:32:31.124 --> 01:32:33.916
Sit. Please, sit.

1008
01:32:34.957 --> 01:32:36.332
Thank you.

[tram bells rings]

1013
01:34:45.041 --> 01:34:46.832
[Michal] You're in a very German area.

1014
01:34:48.291 --> 01:34:51.791
The building opposite is a hospital
taking in wounded from the Russian front.

1015
01:34:54.457 --> 01:34:56.582
And next door is the Schutzpolizei.

1016
01:34:59.207 --> 01:35:00.707
[Michal] Safest place to be.

1017
01:35:01.707 --> 01:35:03.666
Right in the heart of the lion's den.

1018
01:35:09.707 --> 01:35:11.082
I’ll be locking you in.

1019
01:35:12.082 --> 01:35:15.582
No-one knows you're here,
so keep as quiet as possible.

Thank you.

1026
01:37:34.832 --> 01:37:37.666
This is Antek Szalas.
He’ll be looking after you.

1027
01:37:38.791 --> 01:37:39.916
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

1028
01:37:40.624 --> 01:37:41.791
Thank you.

1029
01:37:42.499 --> 01:37:47.291
I've given him a second key. He’ll
bring you food, see that you're alright.

1030
01:37:48.166 --> 01:37:50.291
He's with the underground,
he's a good man.

1031
01:37:54.832 --> 01:37:59.124
-You don't remember me Mr. Szpilman?
-I don't think so.

1032
01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:02.624
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician.

1033
01:38:03.291 --> 01:38:05.332
[Szalas] I saw you almost every day.

1034
01:38:05.749 --> 01:38:06.832
[Szalas pours a drink]

1035
01:38:07.332 --> 01:38:10.041
-I'm sorry, I don't remember, I...
-It doesn't matter.

1036
01:38:12.749 --> 01:38:15.874
You've nothing to worry about.
I’ll visit often.

1037
01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:20.041
You’ll be pleased to hear that
the Allies are bombing Germany...

1038
01:38:20.124 --> 01:38:22.124
night after night, after night.

1039
01:38:22.499 --> 01:38:25.124
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

1040
01:38:25.207 --> 01:38:28.624
And the Russians are really giving
them hell. It's the beginning of the end.

1041
01:38:28.707 --> 01:38:29.916
Oh, let's hope so.

Still alive then?

1049
01:39:22.749 --> 01:39:26.749
Here. Sausage, bread.

1050
01:39:26.832 --> 01:39:28.457
You still got that vodka?

1051
01:39:43.332 --> 01:39:46.874
-How long is this meant to last?
-Not long now.

1052
01:39:48.207 --> 01:39:50.416
I think, I think I've got jaundice.

1053
01:39:51.457 --> 01:39:55.207
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.

1054
01:39:56.541 --> 01:39:59.874
My grandfather was jilted by
his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

1055
01:40:00.707 --> 01:40:01.582
Drink up.

Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks.

1058
01:40:06.749 --> 01:40:07.999

-Money.
-[car door slams]

1060
01:40:11.332 --> 01:40:13.332
I've got to raise money to buy the food.

1061
01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:17.082
I need things to sell,
it's not easy.

1063
01:40:21.749 --> 01:40:23.916
[Wladek] Here. Sell this.

1064
01:40:26.749 --> 01:40:28.791
Food's more important than time.

1067
01:40:34.207 --> 01:40:37.416
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!
The Allies have landed in France.

1068
01:40:37.499 --> 01:40:39.374
Russians will be here soon.

1069
01:40:40.249 --> 01:40:42.332
They’ll beat the shit
out of the Germans...

1070
01:40:44.082 --> 01:40:45.499
any day now.

1071

Wladek?

1075

Wladek?

1076
01:41:41.207 --> 01:41:44.249
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

1077
01:41:44.749 --> 01:41:46.374
[Wladek whimpers]

1078
01:41:46.541 --> 01:41:48.957
-I’ll get a doctor.
-You can't. It's too dangerous.

1079
01:41:49.041 --> 01:41:51.957
-I’ll get Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.
-Dorota. Don't be ridiculous,

1080
01:41:52.041 --> 01:41:52.957
he's a pediatrician.

1081
01:41:53.041 --> 01:41:55.041
-He's still a doctor.
-No.

1082
01:41:55.791 --> 01:41:58.249
You stay. I’ll go.

1083

[Wladek whimpers]

1085
01:42:31.707 --> 01:42:33.582
We came to say goodbye.

1086
01:42:34.791 --> 01:42:37.749
We're going to stay
with my mother in Otwocks.

1087
01:42:37.999 --> 01:42:40.041
The baby's already there. It's safer.

1088
01:42:41.457 --> 01:42:44.457
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.

1089
01:42:44.541 --> 01:42:46.374
[Wladek whimpers]

1090
01:42:46.832 --> 01:42:49.374
That man Szalas should be shot.

1091
01:42:50.749 --> 01:42:54.332
He's been collecting money
on your behalf all over Warsaw.

1092

[Wladek moans]

1093
01:42:55.832 --> 01:43:00.541
Apparently people gave generously,
so he collected a tidy sum.

01:43:00.707 --> 01:43:02.999
[Wladek coughs]

1095
01:43:04.707 --> 01:43:06.207
My God.

The liver the size of a football.
Acute inflammation of the gall bladder...

1097
01:43:16.707 --> 01:43:17.957
but he’ll live.

1098
01:43:21.624 --> 01:43:25.124
I’ll try to get him some levulose,
but it's not easy.

1099
01:43:25.999 --> 01:43:29.291
-Can you visit him again?
-Who knows.
