1
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,444
Two of your men dead
in 2 days, Colonel.

2
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,112
It seems you’ve lost control
of your company.

3
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,159
Will Lieutenant Scott be granted
the right to stand trial...

4
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,744
and face this charge?

5
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,913
Major Fussel saw him
standing over the body.

6
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,873
I would say he’s had his trial.

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,751
Any prisoner accused of a crime
against another prisoner...

8
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,044
has a right to a trial.

9
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,255
And if the boy
were being held in Alabama...

10
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,673
there wouldn’t be
any trial at all.

11
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,049
Is this not so?

12
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,593
Yeah, maybe you’re
right, Colonel.

13
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,513
Maybe we should
just forget the trial.

14
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,181
Let’s just drag him
out of the barracks...

15
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,391
and shoot 2 holes
in his chest...

16
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,059
Like you do with
Lieutenant Archer.

17
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,773
A trial.

18
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,650
A court-martial.

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,195
Like in your American movies?

20
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,281
Yes?

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,908
Yeah, something like that.

22
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,411
That should be fun.

23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,913
Yeah.

24
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,749
All right, Colonel.

25
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,878
You may conduct it...

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,087
in your theater here.

27
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,647
Colonel, my men are in
this theater every day.

28
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,815
With your permission...

29
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:47,983
we’d like to erect
a billet tent...

30
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,151
to house the proceedings.

31
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,319
No.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,487
Your theater
will do quite nicely.

33
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,822
You have until
the end of the week...

34
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,990
to conduct your trial.

35
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,658
It’s a capital charge,
Colonel.

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,327
The trial will take
more than a few days.

37
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,329
One thousand more American
prisoners from the Ardennes...

38
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,331
will be arriving
over the weekend.

39
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,833
I am putting them
in your theater.

40
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,001
Colonel, I just
explained to you--

41
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,211
Colonel...

42
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,880
Saturday, your theater is mine.

43
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,811
Wait. Colonel!

44
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,481
This is a murder site.

45
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,450
I beg your pardon,
Lieutenant.

46
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,660
I said
this is a murder site.

47
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,287
The body and
everything around it...

48
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,289
are now evidence.

49
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,624
This area cannot
be disturbed...

50
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,167
until everything
is photographed.

51
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,506
Of course.

52
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,020
I’m appointing you counsel
for Lieutenant Scott.

53
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,609
Sir, I’m not a lawyer.

54
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,111
You sounded like one
a minute ago.

55
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,990
I could be
a material witness.

56
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,450
I mean, I heard
the lieutenant going out.

57
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,785
The lieutenant
needs our help.

58
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,121
I’ve appointed you counsel.

59
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,289
Understood?

60
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,125
Yes, sir.

61
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,293
Dismissed, Lieutenant.

62
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,462
Sir.

63
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,091
And this guy
that’s prosecuting me...

64
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,468
this Captain Sisk...

65
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,803
is he a real lawyer?

66
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,264
Yes.

67
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,807
That sounds about right.

68
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,771
I think we have to paint
this thing as a fight, Scott.

69
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,272
That’s all.

70
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,982
It was a fight
that got a little out of hand.

71
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,653
You’re supposed to ask me
if I did it, first.

72
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,324
Look, I came here
to kill Nazis.

73
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,953
If it was some crackers
that I wanted to kill...

74
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,287
I could have stayed in Macon.

75
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,456
Major Fussel ID’d you
standing over the body.

76
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,958
Fussel is a Nazi!

77
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,335
No. Fussel is a witness...

78
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,672
and he’s enough to hang you.

79
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,634
Look, all I’m saying
is if it was a fight...

80
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:01,802
that got a little
out of hand...

81
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,136
then it’s not murder.

82
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,304
It’s manslaughter.

83
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,848
Do you understand that?

84
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,107
Man, oh, man.

85
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,444
Can I fire you?

86
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,779
Oh, look, Scott,
I’m just trying--

87
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,614
If it’s a colored guy
on trial...

88
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,910
and it’s a white man
who’s been murdered...

89
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,288
there’s no such thing
as manslaughter.

90
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,290
Don’t you know that?

91
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,791
Or is that something
that they teach you...

92
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,626
in the third year
of law school?

93
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,131
What do you expect
from me, anyway?

94
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,632
A "Hey, yes, sir, boss."

95
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,261
Or "Why, thank you, boss.
You’re mighty kind."

96
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,805
Is that the way
a railroaded colored man acts...

97
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,931
where you’re from?

98
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,099
Nobody’s railroading you, Scott.

99
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,767
Then how come
the only real lawyer...

100
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,311
is the guy
that’s prosecuting me...

101
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,479
and I’m stuck with you
defending me?

102
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,318
That’s how the Colonel
wanted it.

103
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,654
Yeah, but I ain’t
being railroaded.

104
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,337
I’ll meet you
back at the barracks.

105
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,505
Yes, sir.

106
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,309
Well, Lieutenant?

107
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,686
I’m gonna need
a few things, sir.

108
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,688
Who has Bedford’s
personal effects?

109
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,023
We do.

110
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,858
I’ll need to see them...

111
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,527
and the photographs
that were taken of the scene...

112
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,862
and of course, his body.

113
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:47,699
What did Scott tell you?

114
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,160
Sir?

115
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,328
You were with him all day.

116
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,538
What did he tell you?

117
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,499
I’m sorry, sir.
I can’t reveal that.

118
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,708
Sure you can.

119
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,712
Attorney-client privilege, sir.

120
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,842
Only an attorney
has attorney-client privilege.

121
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,218
I need to be briefed
on everything...

122
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,345
that Scott intends
to testify to.

123
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,889
Sir, you’re going to be
President of the court-martial.

124
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,141
How can I possibly
discuss our case with you?

125
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,309
Are you suggesting...

126
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,519
that I would betray
Lieutenant Scott?

127
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,980
That I would share
details of his case...

128
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,189
with the prosecution?

129
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,986
No, sir.

130
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,822
Scott followed Bedford out
through the night latrine.

131
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,156
If he testifies to that fact...

132
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,158
every German in this camp
will know how we get in...

133
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,160
and out of the barracks
after dark...

134
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,829
and every man in this camp
would be compromised...

135
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:34,997
because of that.

136
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,498
Are you following this,
Lieutenant?

137
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,041
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

138
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,504
Now, Scott will testify
that he went out...

139
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,173
through a hole
beneath the stove...

140
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,341
in the barracks.

141
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,178
And you will make certain
that he is clear on that.

142
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,846
Do we understand each other,
Lieutenant?

143
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,055
We do, sir.

144
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,391
Dismissed.

145
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,519
Permission to speak, sir.

146
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,021
Speak freely.

147
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,064
Scott thinks this is all
just for show.

148
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,026
He thinks you passed sentence...

149
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,402
as soon as the body
hit the ground.

150
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,574
Is he right?

151
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,660
Bedford’s footlocker
is in my barracks.

152
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,829
I’ll make sure you get it.

153
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,035
Not much to look at, is he?

154
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,128
Did you know him?

155
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,256
No.

156
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,258
Not personally.

157
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,301
But my guards certainly
seemed to.

158
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,887
These are for you.

159
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,893
Thank you.

160
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,064
How well?

161
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,693
Your guards,
you said they knew him.

162
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,902
How well?

163
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,240
Well, you’ll have to ask them
about that.

164
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,081
This is yours, too.

165
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,587
We found it on his wrist.

166
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,548
But with the inscription...

167
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,383
and those new boots
on your feet...

168
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,593
I made the assumption.

169
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,556
It’s a little hard
to imagine, Colonel...

170
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:00,893
your guards
sitting for an interview.

171
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,269
I can arrange it.

172
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,439
I can arrange
anything you like.

173
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,734
It seems only fair...

174
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,361
what with your colonel
throwing you to the wolves.

175
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,490
I’m not sure I follow you.

176
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,700
Really?

177
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,371
Yale isn’t in the habit
of accepting half-wits.

178
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:25,542
At least it wasn’t
when I was studying there.

179
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,423
The oldest member
of the class of ‘28.

180
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,552
My fellow students voted me
hardest worker.

181
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,851
But we can swap stories
some other time, can’t we?

182
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,646
Right now we’ve got a trial
to prepare for.

183
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,943
It’s a sincere offer,
Lieutenant.

184
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,114
Anything I can do to help...

185
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,242
Truly.

186
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,956
And exactly where were you,
Major Fussel...

187
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,290
on the night in question?

188
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,919
I was walking the area
behind this theater...

189
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,504
and the Australian compound.

190
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:11,964
At about what time?

191
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,550
Maybe about 1:00
in the morning.

192
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,219
And can you tell the court
what you saw?

193
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,682
The schwarz Lieutenant Scott
was kneeling over the body.

194
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:25,102
It looked to me like he was
checking that the man was dead.

195
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,145
I blew my whistle,
and he started to run.

196
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,981
And what did you do next?

197
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:32,109
I would have shot,
but it was dark.

198
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,236
And so was he.

199
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,198
Major Fussel, how well
did you know Sergeant Bedford?

200
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,366
A little, I think.

201
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,951
You traded with him regularly.

202
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,536
Traded?

203
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:43,704
Bartered.

204
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,581
Cigarettes for a pair of boots.

205
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,166
Chocolate for some spare parts.

206
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,626
No. I never did this.

207
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,504
A kriegie trading
with a German soldier?

208
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,672
I never saw it.

209
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,967
Am I allowed to repeat what
he actually said to Captain?

210
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,177
You may, Private.

211
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,512
Lieutenant Scott said,
"I’ll kill you.

212
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,848
"I’ll fucking kill you,
Bedford."

213
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,100
Corporal, have you ever
heard any other man...

214
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,644
threaten a fellow soldier
during your time in the army?

215
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,521
"Better shape up
or I’ll kill you."

216
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,190
"I’ll kill you if you touch
my cigarettes again."

217
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,108
-That sort of thing?
-Yes, sir.

218
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,694
I’ll bet you’ve even made such
a threat yourself once or twice.

219
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,862
I suppose so.

220
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,614
Corporal, did you ever
actually kill any of the men...

221
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,823
you threatened in this manner?

222
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,492
No, sir.

223
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,661
But I’m not colored.

224
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,663
I can control myself.

225
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,124
So, you, too,
had heard the threats...

226
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,251
made by the accused
against Sergeant Bedford?

227
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,295
Your Honor, this being the
fourth prosecution witness...

228
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,339
called to testify
in this matter...

229
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,007
if the defense will stipulate
that the accused...

230
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,343
did indeed threaten the life
of Sergeant Bedford...

231
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,969
could we dispense
with any further testimony...

232
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,179
-to his having done so?
-Your Honor...

233
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,556
Sergeant Webb is being called
as an eyewitness...

234
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,682
to the crime itself.

235
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,267
He’s what?

236
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,477
Is that right, Sergeant?

237
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,187
Yes, sir.

238
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:51,522
-Sir, that’s a lie.
-Your Honor...

239
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,899
the sergeant will testify that
on the night of the murder...

240
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,735
he watched through a window
in barracks 27...

241
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,446
as Lieutenant Scott
accosted Sergeant Bedford...

242
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,532
outside the theater
and broke his neck.

243
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,699
Your Honor,
he did no such thing.

244
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,159
I was standing
right beside Sergeant Webb...

245
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,452
at the exact time
of the murder.

246
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,454
-He saw nothing of the sort.
-The hell I didn’t.

247
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,581
You don’t know what I saw.

248
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,209
Sir, I request that this court
instruct this witness

249
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,419
as to the consequences of
perjuring himself in a court--

250
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,879
He put his hand on the Bible...

251
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,339
and swore to tell the truth,
Lieutenant.

252
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,507
-That’s good enough for me.
-Objection, Your Honor.

253
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:19,675
We’ve had no prior notice
of his testimony.

254
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,343
-Sit down, Lieutenant.
-Your Honor, his bias alone--

255
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,553
Lieutenant!

256
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,515
Sit down, please.

257
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,403
I’ll catch up.

258
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,740
I gotta go make some trades
in barracks 18.

259
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,868
See if you
can get me some smokes.

260
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,077
Webb...

261
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,663
You’re a lying sack of shit,
you know that?

262
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,039
Yeah, and maybe you ought
to mind your own business.

263
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,207
This doesn’t concern you, West.

264
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,792
-Hey, Lieutenant.
-Or you. Any of you.

265
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,919
What do you know, Joe?
George S. Patton just showed up.

266
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,713
Return to your barracks,
Corporal.

267
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,173
Take your 2 friends with you.

268
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,596
So, what is it, Webb?

269
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,514
Up there today.

270
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,641
You think you owe it to Vic?

271
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,229
Why are you so bent about
that flying bellhop anyway?

272
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,397
He’s a soldier.

273
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:16,940
Vic Bedford was a soldier.

274
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,068
He fought.
He had courage.

275
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,155
You wouldn’t know too much about
that, would you, Lieutenant?

276
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,157
You lied in there today.

277
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,951
You didn’t see what happened
any more than I did.

278
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:31,747
I didn’t have to.
I know.

279
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:32,956
Not good enough.

280
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,709
It’s good enough for McNamara.

281
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,859
Sorry about what happened
in there today, Lincoln.

282
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:03,403
I didn’t see it coming.

283
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,699
You’re saying that’s
the first time...

284
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,409
you seen a man lie
through his teeth...

285
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,786
holding his hand on a bible?

286
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,791
I was writing a letter
to my father.

287
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,085
Figured I should tell him first.

288
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,842
He was part of
the 369th Infantry...

289
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,886
in the last war,
the old 15th.

290
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,725
They was the first negro troops
to go into action in France.

291
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,563
Did your father serve?

292
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,191
My father
was in headquarters.

293
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:43,610
He had an 8
on his shoulder, too.

294
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:44,945
His father made sure of it.

295
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,198
That’s how we do things
in our family.

296
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,578
That’s a shame.

297
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,039
Got your testimony to prepare.

298
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,294
Yeah.

299
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,409
Lieutenant.

300
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,244
How are you?

301
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,206
Not too well, I imagine.

302
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,416
Come on up.

303
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,047
That was quite a beating
you took today.

304
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,842
It’s warm inside.

305
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,646
You’ve read Mark Twain?

306
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:01,855
It’s wonderful.

307
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,733
Colonel, I have witnesses
to prepare for.

308
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,276
Yes. I know.

309
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,779
It’s why I wanted to see you.

310
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,923
We keep a library of all
American military manuals.

311
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:32,010
I thought this one might be
of particular use to you.

312
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,225
I can’t accept this, Colonel.

313
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,268
We have a policy
about fraternizing...

314
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,520
Lieutenant,
without this, your client...

315
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,355
will face the firing squad.

316
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,649
Would that be better?

317
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,284
Your son?

318
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,120
Yes.

319
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,164
Where’s he fighting?

320
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,795
He is not anymore.

321
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,841
The Russian front.

322
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,804
Horrible place.

323
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,767
I’m sorry.

324
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:26,440
I killed my share of English
and French, I suppose...

325
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,484
in the first war.

326
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,614
They had fathers, too.

327
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,667
It’s verboten, you know.

328
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:49,880
Negro jazz.

329
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,384
These might be the only copies
of their kind...

330
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,594
in the entire Reich.

331
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:01,016
But I’m quite fond of them.

332
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,022
Nice to read by, anyway.

333
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,151
Takes a man right back.

334
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,198
Take a seat.

335
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,370
Thank you for your time,
Colonel.

336
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:24,623
Lieutenant...

337
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:29,711
Enjoy the manual.

338
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,443
Come to order, gentlemen.

339
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,028
Captain Sisk,
is the prosecution...

340
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,280
prepared to call
its next witness?

341
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,447
We are, Your Honor.

342
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,324
Begging the court’s pardon, sir.

343
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,243
Yes, Lieutenant?

344
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,411
Before we continue,
Your Honor...

345
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,037
it’s been brought to
my attention that the court...

346
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,540
may have overlooked a few
procedural matters yesterday.

347
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,460
I’m referring to the "U.S. Army
Manual for Courts-Martial"...

348
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,672
chapter 12, sections 57, 58.

349
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:15,883
Make your point.

350
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,384
According to these sections,
Your Honor...

351
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,761
the court was obliged yesterday
to ask the accused...

352
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,139
if he wished to challenge
any members of the court...

353
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:25,058
for peremptory disqualification
before any pleas were entered.

354
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,104
A little late in the game
for that, isn’t it, Lieutenant?

355
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,273
Nevertheless, it is a right...

356
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,774
specifically granted
to the defendant.

357
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,072
Very well.

358
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:42,951
Does the accused
wish to challenge...

359
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,286
any member of the court now?

360
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,079
We do, Your Honor.

361
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:48,790
You, sir.

362
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:53,504
Request denied.
Proceed, Captain Sisk.

363
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:56,465
Sir, according to chapter 12,
section 58d...

364
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,300
defense is allowed
1 peremptory challenge...

365
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,426
of the board,
and this challenge...

366
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:01,803
is not subject to any ruling
by the court itself.

367
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:02,930
Request denied, Lieutenant.

368
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,516
Then the court must address
section 58e...

369
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,267
which states the defense
may disqualify...

370
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,102
a member of the board
for cause...

371
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,063
if that member
has displayed a bias...

372
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,564
toward the accused or his case.

373
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,066
This court has shown no bias
in this case, Lieutenant.

374
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,234
Your Honor,
the court has demonstrated...

375
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,611
in ex parte conversations
before the commencement...

376
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:21,448
of this hearing a distinct
prejudice against the accused...

377
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,618
his case, and his counsel, sir.

378
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:41,593
Very well.

379
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,762
We’ll take a short recess
to consider the matter.

380
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,598
-Lieutenant Hart.
-Sir?

381
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,308
Can I see you outside
for a moment, please?

382
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:03,991
Sir?

383
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,701
Listen to me,
you pampered little shit.

384
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,329
I will not be laughed at.
Not by him.

385
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,124
Sir, I’m just trying
to protect my client.

386
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,459
Your client’s about to lose
his lawyer, Lieutenant.

387
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,045
Sir?

388
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:20,007
Article 32: contempt of court.

389
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,010
Article 70: intentional delay.

390
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,221
I know the book, too.

391
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,556
Forwards and backwards.

392
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:29,057
Then you must know, sir, that--

393
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,934
Shut up and listen to me,
Lieutenant.

394
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:35,939
You will not accept anything
from that commandant again.

395
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,149
Is that clear?

396
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,068
You will not allow him
to participate...

397
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,820
in these proceedings,
is that clear?

398
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,740
You will never set foot
in his office again...

399
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,033
without my permission.

400
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:48,494
We understand each other?

401
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:09,181
...and propaganda reported
by them...

402
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:11,767
and by the Germans
over Strasbourg.

403
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,312
One minute you can hear
Hitler himself announcing...

404
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:18,774
that he will be in Strasbourg
by January the 30th...

405
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,985
the anniversary of the Nazis
coming to power in Germany.

406
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:25,948
The next, the Nazis are claiming
that 2 new divisions...

407
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:27,574
are advancing on Strasbourg...

408
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:30,744
and that the Americans are
in full flight from Alsace.

409
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,665
The closer they get,
the more violent they become.

410
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:38,502
The Nazi menace are offering
their promises.

411
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,337
But today...

412
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:42,965
Come in. Have a seat.

413
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:47,135
We’ve checked German...

414
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,641
Have a drink.

415
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,434
Sure.

416
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,857
Maybe you can help me
decipher some of this code...

417
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:03,485
coming through
the BBC tonight, yeah?

418
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,112
I don’t think you need
my help, Colonel.

419
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,282
Seems pretty clear
what they’re saying.

420
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,037
It would seem so.

421
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:21,712
Or perhaps
it’s all propaganda.

422
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,380
How about that?

423
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:44,401
Strange thing about war wounds.

424
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:51,909
The older you grow, the less
proud you become of them.

425
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,979
Got another one of these
around here somewhere?

426
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:23,398
Of course.

427
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,527
Good. Why don’t you and I take
a walk out on your compound...

428
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,278
and have ourselves
an old-fashioned duel?

429
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,866
That would be fitting,
wouldn’t it?

430
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,578
But surely you can think
of a more clever way...

431
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:39,373
out of this camp
than that, yes?

432
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:51,260
You think the war will wait
for you, is that it, Colonel?

433
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:58,475
It won’t, you know.
They never do.

434
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:07,025
You’re drunk.

435
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,528
Yeah.

436
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,907
But I’m seeing things
very clearly.

437
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:22,791
You know, sometimes I think
your Lieutenant Scott...

438
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,793
might have been better off
in Alabama.

439
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,797
Lynchings are over in minutes.

440
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:34,803
The kind of justice he’s
suffering here is far crueler.

441
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,973
Is that why you gave
Lieutenant Hart the manual?

442
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,852
I was merely
trying to help the lad.

443
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:43,854
He’s got enough
to worry about...

444
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,647
without providing you
with amusement.

445
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,567
Yes.

446
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:53,280
He’s got you to worry about,
hasn’t he?

447
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,408
Stay out of our business.

448
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:02,706
Forgive me, Colonel,
but you’re hardly...

449
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:04,833
in a position
to hand out orders.

450
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,711
Especially to me.

451
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:14,676
For now.

452
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,524
Unless, of course,
you think that’s just...

453
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,859
the sound of propaganda
falling out there.

454
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,164
Well, the idea was
to follow Bedford...

455
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:45,916
and catch him
on the compound.

456
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,168
I wanted to drag him back
under the barracks...

457
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,628
and put his face in the mud.

458
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,130
Well, by the time
I got to him...

459
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:54,132
he was already dead
behind the theater...

460
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,634
neck had been snapped.

461
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,177
That’s when everything blew up.

462
00:27:57,219 --> 00:28:00,681
Dogs, you know, hands up,
and that was that.

463
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,558
Lieutenant,
did you apply anything...

464
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:05,185
to your face or hands
before going out that night?

465
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:07,437
Shoe polish? Soot?

466
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,897
No.

467
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,399
Defense exhibit 1, Your Honor.

468
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,861
Photos of the deceased taken
in the camp morgue.

469
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,530
The court will note
black smudges...

470
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:18,323
on Bedford’s right cheek
and jaw.

471
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,744
Your Honor, what is
the relevance of this?

472
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:24,830
To demonstrate to the court...

473
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,957
that whoever killed
Vic Bedford was white.

474
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:29,877
I’d like to ask
the court’s permission...

475
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:32,045
to conduct a demonstration,
Your Honor.

476
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:34,631
I’d also ask the trial judge
advocate to rise, if he would.

477
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:36,884
Proceed.

478
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:41,013
Based on Bedford’s wounds
and the fact that...

479
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:43,223
nobody reported hearing him
cry for help that night...

480
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:45,017
we have to assume
that he was either...

481
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,393
friendly with his assailant...

482
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,604
or that whoever killed him
did so from behind...

483
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,314
the positioning being
something like this.

484
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:51,899
Captain, if you wouldn’t mind
grabbing at me...

485
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:54,151
at my face
to get me to stop.

486
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:56,570
Now, of course, the killer
had the benefits...

487
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:59,865
of leverage and surprise,
so the neck was snapped...

488
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:04,953
and Bedford fell,
and the smudge went with him.

489
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,414
It was also on his fingers.
Captain?

490
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:11,960
At this time,
I would like the court...

491
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,462
to note the following
for the record:

492
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,255
whoever killed Vic Bedford...

493
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:17,758
had such a substance on his face
on the night of the murder...

494
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,801
which raises 2 questions.

495
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:23,263
First, what call
would Lincoln Scott have...

496
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,723
for darkening his face?

497
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,183
To look more black?

498
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:29,937
Second, if he had done so,
when did he take it off?

499
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:31,188
Your Honor, you stood
face to face with him...

500
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,439
immediately
after his capture.

501
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:33,649
His face was clean.

502
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:35,651
I think it’s fair to conclude...

503
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,487
that whoever killed Vic Bedford
was not only white...

504
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,656
but was waiting
behind this theater...

505
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,242
face blackened to avoid
detection by the guards.

506
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:45,369
Nothing further, Your Honor.

507
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:49,414
Lieutenant, you say that
Sergeant Bedford sneaked out...

508
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:53,043
through a loose board
beneath the barracks’ stove.

509
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:55,546
Is that right?

510
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:02,094
Yes, sir.

511
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,137
And you took that same route
on the night in question...

512
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:05,472
after he’d gone out.

513
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,851
Yes, I did, sir.

514
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:11,144
What did you find down there,
Lieutenant?

515
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:12,980
Excuse me, sir?

516
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:15,858
What was down there
on the ground?

517
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:20,237
Mud, right?

518
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,489
You stated that it had been
your intention...

519
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:24,533
to put the victim’s face
in the mud...

520
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:26,201
until he begged you to stop...

521
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:28,745
so there was mud down there,
isn’t that right, Lieutenant?

522
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:31,123
I suppose so.

523
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,709
And a fair amount of soot
from the stove itself.

524
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:37,212
So it’s possible
that Sergeant Bedford...

525
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,673
having descended through
a hole lined with soot...

526
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:41,175
and then having crawled
facedown...

527
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,677
beneath the barracks
wet with mud...

528
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:47,222
might have emerged with mud
and soot on his face.

529
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:51,935
Nothing further, Your Honor.

530
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:55,731
Thank you, Captain Sisk.

531
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,442
Will you step down, Lieutenant?

532
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:04,531
Lieutenant Scott?

533
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:10,454
You know how hard they tried...

534
00:31:10,496 --> 00:31:15,042
to wash us out of flight
school--the colored flyers?

535
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,169
Your testimony’s been entered,
Lieutenant.

536
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:18,962
You can step down.

537
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,547
It was test after test.

538
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:25,427
I mean, anything they
could come up with to turn us...

539
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:29,097
into the cooks or the drivers
or the shit shovelers.

540
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:30,724
Your Honor,
this is highly unnecessary.

541
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:34,228
-The witness has already--
-But I refused to wash out.

542
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:37,814
So did Archer.
I mean, come hell or high water.

543
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:39,149
We hit the books.

544
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,692
We were just determined...

545
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:44,696
that we were not going to spend
the war being some niggers.

546
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:46,615
That’s enough, Lieutenant.
You will take your seat.

547
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:47,825
With all due respect, sir...

548
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:50,702
I would like to exercise
my right and address this court.

549
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:54,748
Now, I’ve been sitting down
ever since I got here.

550
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,210
And you know, I should have
stood up and said something...

551
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:00,462
the moment that you threw us in
with the enlisted men...

552
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:03,590
instead of quartering us
properly as officers.

553
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,765
But it’s OK.

554
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:15,060
You see, colored men
expect to have to jump...

555
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:17,813
through a few hoops
in this man’s army.

556
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:20,649
Archer knew that.
We all did.

557
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:30,784
There’s a camp right outside
of Macon, where I’m from, and...

558
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:35,164
there the army sends
the German POWs...

559
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,917
puts them to work
picking cotton.

560
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:43,380
But what’s strange is
every once in a while...

561
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:45,465
we’d see them
walking through town...

562
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:49,094
going to movies,
eating in diners...

563
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,972
but if I wanted to go
to those same movies...

564
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,974
I had to sit way off
in the balcony.

565
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:57,686
And those diners were closed
to me even in uniform.

566
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:02,232
But German POWs were allowed
to sit there and eat.

567
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,400
And this must have happened...

568
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:05,903
to at least half the guys
at Tuskegee.

569
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:07,070
But the thing is...

570
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:10,741
we just kept telling ourselves
that no matter what...

571
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,911
as long as we did our jobs,
it’d all be worth it...

572
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:17,789
because hey, the war would end,
we could go home...

573
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:20,584
and be free to walk down
any street in America...

574
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:23,879
with our heads held high as men.

575
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:28,342
So that’s what we did.

576
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:29,760
We did our jobs.

577
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,353
We served our country, sir,
Archer and I.

578
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:42,105
And what you
let happen to him...

579
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:45,943
what you allowed to happen
to him...

580
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:49,613
was appalling.

581
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:55,911
And so is this.

582
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:20,310
At ease, Lieutenant.

583
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,362
How are they treating you?

584
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,907
No worse than the men
in my barracks, sir.

585
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,372
I can probably find you
another blanket.

586
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:41,456
No. I’m fine.

587
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:00,017
Good night.

588
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,480
New order, gentlemen.

589
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:31,692
Before you proceed, Your Honor,
the defense hasn’t rested yet.

590
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,277
Still like to call
one last witness.

591
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:39,408
Defense calls
Oberst Werner Visser.

592
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,997
This some kind of joke,
Lieutenant?

593
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:46,540
He’s material to our case, sir.

594
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,169
Unless, of course,
the colonel refuses to testify.

595
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,214
He does not.

596
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,431
Colonel, could you tell us...

597
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:04,224
the nature of your relationship
with Vic Bedford?

598
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:07,895
I’ll be happy to.
I didn’t have one.

599
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:09,980
And what about your guards,
Colonel?

600
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,024
Major Fussel, for instance?

601
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:15,235
Were you aware of his dealings
with Vic Bedford...

602
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:17,446
at night after lockdown?

603
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:20,866
That would be impossible
in this camp, Lieutenant.

604
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:21,950
Policy forbids.

605
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:25,662
Do you remember
the conversation we had...

606
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,456
in the camp morgue 4 days ago?

607
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:29,917
Vaguely.

608
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,252
I asked you
if you knew Vic Bedford...

609
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:36,381
and you said, "No, but my guards
certainly seem to."

610
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,758
Perhaps.

611
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,176
So, in your words...

612
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:41,512
no guard ever traded with
Vic Bedford...

613
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:44,681
and yet he was able to acquire
winter boots...

614
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:48,685
thick socks, fresh milk,
and parts for a hidden radio.

615
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:49,811
Isn’t that a fact?

616
00:37:51,063 --> 00:37:54,900
Lieutenant, I’m sitting here as
a gesture of military courtesy.

617
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:58,821
If it is your intention
to paint me as a liar--

618
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:00,531
No, Colonel.

619
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:01,990
It is my intention
to establish...

620
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,368
that Vic Bedford built up
enough of a rapport...

621
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,787
with your majors Wirtz
and Fussel...

622
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:09,706
to engage in the framing of
Lamar Archer...

623
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,667
conspiring with them
in the tent spike incident...

624
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,002
which resulted in
Archer’s death.

625
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:17,381
Lieutenant Archer was shot
while attempting escape.

626
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:18,674
No, Colonel.

627
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:22,344
Lieutenant Archer was executed
in return for information.

628
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:25,347
Archer dies.

629
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,349
Five minutes later...

630
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:30,394
Colonel Visser and Major Wirtz
enter Barracks 22...

631
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,396
and destroy a hidden radio...

632
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,189
that they had been trying
to locate for months.

633
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:45,450
Can you tell the court anything
about these items, sir?

634
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:48,745
Identification papers,
some currency.

635
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,581
What of them?

636
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:54,168
Perfect German-made I.D. papers
and reichsmarks.

637
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:56,670
Two thousand of them.

638
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:01,925
More than enough cash to make it
through the country.

639
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,387
Vic Bedford kept those
in a stash beside his bunk.

640
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:06,555
Again, can you tell the court...

641
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,348
the nature of your relationship
with Vic Bedford?

642
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,267
I did not have one, Lieutenant.

643
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:11,310
Do you have any idea...

644
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:13,270
how he may have gotten
these items, sir?

645
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:15,772
If they didn’t come from you...

646
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:18,275
and if he never had any dealings
with your guards...

647
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:19,610
the fact is, Colonel...

648
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:22,321
Vic Bedford traded with you
and your men regularly.

649
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,363
Objection, Your Honor!

650
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,365
As soon as he came up dry
on you, you ordered his murder.

651
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:26,867
Isn’t that right, Colonel?

652
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:27,910
Lieutenant Hart...

653
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,372
I thought you tried
marvelously...

654
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:36,376
to establish that the killer had
blackened his face with soot.

655
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,796
Now, if any of my guards...

656
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,050
or even I wanted to kill
one of my prisoners--

657
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:44,593
Vic Bedford in this case--

658
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:48,889
we would hardly need to blacken
our faces to do it.

659
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,433
Would we?

660
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,266
Move. In the corner, Webb.

661
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:24,146
Captain.

662
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:38,118
You see?

663
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:41,788
German uniforms, explosives.

664
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:44,958
Yes, Captain, I see.

665
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,128
The trial’s got nothing to do
with Lincoln Scott, does it?

666
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:50,172
No.

667
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:52,466
It’s the way it had to go.

668
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,135
We’re out of time, Hart.

669
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,804
We lose this theater tomorrow.

670
00:43:57,846 --> 00:44:00,474
Uh-huh, and I’m supposed to keep
Visser and his men distracted...

671
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:01,642
while half the camp goes out.

672
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:03,810
Is that it, Captain?

673
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:09,942
I’m asking
the wrong fucking guy.

674
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:28,627
I’ve just seen the tunnel,
Colonel.

675
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:36,176
In here, Lieutenant.

676
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,156
Everything in this place
is a lie.

677
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,198
Everything.

678
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:06,832
Jesus Christ.

679
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:11,712
First he told the Germans
about the radio.

680
00:45:13,255 --> 00:45:14,256
It was only a matter of time...

681
00:45:14,298 --> 00:45:15,674
before he told them about
the tunnel.

682
00:45:20,262 --> 00:45:21,305
You killed Bedford.

683
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:26,476
That’s right.

684
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:37,779
If you fuck with this operation
in any way, I’ll kill you, too.

685
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:44,119
You will sit in
that courtroom...

686
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:46,413
as Captain Sisk drags out
these proceedings.

687
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:51,043
Make whatever summation
you like, but that’s it.

688
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:54,796
When that board breaks
to deliberate,

689
00:45:54,796 --> 00:45:56,423
35 men go under the wire.

690
00:45:56,465 --> 00:45:58,050
And Lincoln Scott will be dead.

691
00:45:58,091 --> 00:45:59,092
That’s war, Lieutenant.

692
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:00,761
The war’s at the front, Colonel.
We’re not even in it anymore.

693
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:01,845
Speak for yourself!

694
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:05,807
You know those Russians...

695
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:06,934
they march in and out of here
every day?

696
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:09,603
-You know where they go?
-Munitions plant.

697
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:11,939
The army thinks
it’s a goddamn shoe factory.

698
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:18,445
Look...

699
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:21,573
I don’t want to see Scott dead
any more than you do.

700
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:24,326
But if one man
has to be sacrificed...

701
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:25,369
to take out that target...

702
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,912
then that’s the way
it has to be.

703
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:29,039
-I agree completely, sir.
-Good.

704
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,126
But I think that one man
should be you.

705
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:36,630
And don’t worry.
I’ll play my part.

706
00:46:36,672 --> 00:46:38,131
But at the end of the trial...

707
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:40,676
you’re going to tap
your little gavel.

708
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:41,718
You’re going to stand up...

709
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,345
and you’re going to confess to
the murder.

710
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:44,847
Your duty demands that.

711
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:45,973
Fuck you, Hart.

712
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:48,475
What the fuck would you know
about duty?

713
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:52,938
I’ll see you in court, sir.

714
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,170
I got a better question.

715
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:17,963
What was in that goddamn soup
last night?

716
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,798
I got 20 men
with food poisoning.

717
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,521
Colonel? Whoa! Colonel!

718
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:37,733
You’re in no shape
for the trial, sir.

719
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,444
I’m fine. Really, I’m fine.

720
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:42,321
Here we go.

721
00:47:43,447 --> 00:47:45,741
We’ll convene as scheduled
after the appell.

722
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:47,659
Square ‘em up.

723
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:53,040
Prisoners, attention!

724
00:47:57,377 --> 00:47:58,587
New order, gentlemen.

725
00:47:58,629 --> 00:47:59,671
Captain Sisk...

726
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:04,510
is the prosecution ready
to present its summation?

727
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:05,552
We are, Your Honor.

728
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:07,804
Very well.

729
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:20,067
I’m sorry, gentlemen.

730
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:23,278
The court needs a 5-minute
recess before summations.

731
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:26,698
Colonel. Colonel!

732
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,867
Colonel? Colonel!

733
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:31,078
Let’s get him back
to the barracks.

734
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,204
Get his coat.

735
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:33,747
Get some rest, sir.

736
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:37,251
All right, come on.
Get back to the barracks.

737
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,127
We need an extension, Colonel.
He’s very ill.

738
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:41,713
The agreement was
the end of the week.

739
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:43,257
It’s a matter of courtesy,
Colonel.

740
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:45,259
The agreement was today!

741
00:48:50,472 --> 00:48:51,473
I need to talk to you.

742
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:09,283
Are you any good at poker,
Lincoln?

743
00:49:11,243 --> 00:49:13,912
There’s an escape going to take
place later on this afternoon.

744
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:17,040
Escape? How’s that?

745
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:21,712
Down a tunnel through
that burned theater wing.

746
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:25,591
while the jury’s
in deliberation.

747
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:31,513
So what you mean?
This whole thing’s been a joke?

748
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:33,640
Yes.

749
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:36,810
But Archer and Bedford
are dead for real.

750
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:38,979
Is that part
of this big joke, too?

751
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:41,565
Look, we haven’t got time now.

752
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:43,734
During deliberations you’re
going out under the wire...

753
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:46,028
with 35 other men.

754
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:48,155
Is McNamara, too?

755
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:51,950
Yeah, McNamara, too.

756
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:58,957
It’s funny.
I was just writing my son...

757
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:01,460
and in the letter I was
trying to explain to him...

758
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:05,214
what the word honor means.

759
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,176
It would be a hell of a thing,
wouldn’t it...

760
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:12,554
to find out that your father
helped 35 men...

761
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:14,515
escape from a place
like this, wouldn’t it?

762
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:17,518
You’re going out, too, Lincoln.
You got that?

763
00:50:18,894 --> 00:50:21,021
I can’t do that, Tommy.

764
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:25,234
Suppose the board comes back...

765
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:27,986
and there’s nobody sitting in
the defendant’s chair anymore.

766
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:29,321
It doesn’t matter.
You’ll already be out.

767
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:31,365
Then the search begins...

768
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:34,743
and all those men,
they won’t have a chance.

769
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:36,787
Lincoln, if you stay,
you’ll be convicted.

770
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:40,499
If I stay, those men
are gonna have a chance.

771
00:50:40,499 --> 00:50:41,291
If I stay, those men
are gonna have a chance.

772
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,252
And you’ll be executed.

773
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:49,967
Lincoln, listen to me, please.

774
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:52,928
Everything’s fine, Tommy.

775
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,721
Everything’s really OK...

776
00:50:57,933 --> 00:51:01,103
just as long as he knows
what happened here.

777
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,982
As long as there’s
somebody to tell him.

778
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:13,949
How far could I get anyway?

779
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:17,703
A colored man running through
the German countryside?

780
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:19,621
It’d be target practice.

781
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:47,399
It started with a noble idea.

782
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,820
Letting colored men
join the fight.

783
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:56,325
But no one in the Air Corps ever
considered what might happen...

784
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:59,411
if one of those Tuskegee men
ever got shot down.

785
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:02,581
No one ever asked
what would happen...

786
00:52:02,623 --> 00:52:05,042
if a colored officer
was suddenly captured...

787
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,628
and sent to a stalag
like this one.

788
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:14,259
But Lincoln Scott was shot down
and he was sent to a stalag...

789
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:16,553
and once here,
he wasn’t just thrown in...

790
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:20,098
amongst white enlisted men,
he was quartered with them.

791
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,518
Men like Staff Sergeant
Vic Bedford.

792
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,438
Bedford, the real Bedford,
was a man unknown to us.

793
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,443
Hateful, vengeful, with
a bigotry that ran bone-deep.

794
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:35,697
A man who simply couldn’t
stomach the thought...

795
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:39,368
of sharing a roof
with colored officers.

796
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:41,662
So he badgered Scott,
baited him.

797
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:44,665
Even refused
to respect Scott’s rank.

798
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:49,336
Then conspired to kill the only
friend Scott had in this camp.

799
00:52:49,378 --> 00:52:51,839
That’s why Scott
followed Bedford out...

800
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,257
the night in question...

801
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:57,177
crept up behind him
and snapped his neck.

802
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:00,305
Members of the board,
we take no pleasure...

803
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:02,808
in prosecuting
Lieutenant Scott...

804
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,643
but a capital charge requires...

805
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:07,771
that we put aside
our passions and sympathies...

806
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:11,775
wedding ourselves
solely to the truth.

807
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:13,402
It is this.

808
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:15,279
Lieutenant Scott
was positively...

809
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:17,823
and unimpeachably identified
at the scene of the crime.

810
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:20,784
He had motive,
he had opportunity...

811
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:22,828
and he had an animus
for the victim...

812
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,831
which was confirmed
even by his own testimony.

813
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:32,713
Lincoln Scott is an officer,
he is a soldier...

814
00:53:32,754 --> 00:53:34,381
but he is also a murderer.

815
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:04,453
There’s a tenet that was
drummed into all of us...

816
00:54:04,495 --> 00:54:06,330
from our first day in basic.

817
00:54:07,456 --> 00:54:09,625
Sometimes 1 man
must be sacrificed...

818
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:12,002
for the good
of the men around him.

819
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:14,546
Someone has to be first
to hit the beach...

820
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:18,717
or to jump on a grenade
or to draw enemy fire...

821
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:21,512
so coordinates can be drawn
for mortar teams.

822
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:24,348
Vic Bedford
learned that tenet, too...

823
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:26,683
except Vic got it backwards.

824
00:54:26,725 --> 00:54:29,228
Vic thought that sometimes
a few hundred...

825
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:31,438
must be sacrificed
for the good of 1.

826
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:35,192
Him. For Vic.

827
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:37,402
The watchword was expediency.

828
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:39,321
One day he’d trade
with our captors...

829
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:41,824
to get hard-to-find parts
for a radio...

830
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:43,951
earning him the loyalty
of our commanding officer...

831
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:45,369
and his staff.

832
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:47,746
Then Vic would tell the Germans
where to find that radio...

833
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:48,956
Go.

834
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:51,208
in exchange for the murder
of Lamar Archer.

835
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,462
The army has its share
of cowards...

836
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:59,508
and Vic Bedford was one of them.

837
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:03,679
It also has heroes...
soldiers like Lincoln Scott.

838
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,849
Lincoln Scott who wanted nothing
more than to serve his country.

839
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,517
And serve he did.

840
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,687
Nine downed German fighters,
30 missions...

841
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:15,858
until one of those missions
landed him here, Stalag 6A...

842
00:55:15,899 --> 00:55:18,986
where Vic Bedford and the sad
sacks Bedford called friends...

843
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:20,779
were lying in wait.

844
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:24,241
Scott was a target
from the second he got here.

845
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:28,871
He suffered insults, threats,
but he did not retaliate.

846
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:33,375
He did not kill Vic Bedford.

847
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:35,043
No.

848
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:37,379
Someone beat him to it.

849
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:42,593
It could’ve been
any number of people.

850
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:46,221
The guard who thought
that Bedford had cheated him.

851
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:49,183
A fellow kriegie who discovered
Bedford’s treachery.

852
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:50,601
Even one of our
ranking officers...

853
00:55:50,601 --> 00:55:52,644
as punishment for
ratting out that radio.

854
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:54,938
So this, then, is our victim?

855
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:59,693
A bigot. A traitor. A rat.

856
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:02,070
Enemy of every kriegie in camp.

857
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:07,534
The question is, who hated him
enough to kill him?

858
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:13,749
Colonel.

859
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:22,883
I did.

860
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,640
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

861
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:31,767
I killed Vic Bedford, sir.

862
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:35,938
Come on, Colonel. Here.

863
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:41,485
I want every man in the compound
present...

864
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:43,570
for the execution
of Lieutenant Hart.

865
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:49,159
Very brave.
Very brave, indeed.

866
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:50,285
Colonel, this man has rights.

867
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:51,370
Not anymore.

868
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:52,996
This court still has to
deliberate the matter.

869
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,289
I am the court now!

870
00:56:54,331 --> 00:56:56,124
Now. Get him up.
Get him up. Get him up.

871
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:05,259
Get out.

872
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:21,478
I want every man...

873
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,272
who participated
in the court-martial...

874
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:25,232
removed from the line.

875
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:31,989
Line them up.

876
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:34,616
Line them up. Now.

877
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:36,535
These men knew nothing, Colonel.

878
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:39,913
Line them up!

879
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:42,875
You will be the first.

880
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,251
These men knew nothing.

881
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:46,044
You will be the first!

882
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:47,546
Colonel, they knew nothing!

883
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:13,715
So, your men are saboteurs
as well?

884
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:16,927
No, Colonel,
they’re just soldiers.

885
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:19,012
They were following my orders.

886
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:22,182
I assume complete
responsibility.

887
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:27,104
That’s very noble of you.

888
01:01:36,572 --> 01:01:39,867
Seems you’ve won our duel
after all, Colonel.

889
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:44,246
No.

890
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:49,668
We both lose, don’t we?

891
01:01:52,504 --> 01:01:53,922
Yeah.

892
01:01:57,176 --> 01:02:02,264
And now you wish to
trade your life for theirs?

893
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:12,983
Yes, I do.

894
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,435
Very well.

895
01:05:18,836 --> 01:05:22,631
We buried the Colonel in
a marked grave behind the camp.

896
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:25,300
Three months later,
the German army surrendered.

897
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:27,928
Our stalag was liberated.

898
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,013
The war was over.

899
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:35,561
We returned home to America,
to our families.

900
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:37,104
Lincoln Scott got the chance...

901
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:39,940
to explain the word honor
to his son.

902
01:05:39,982 --> 01:05:45,863
Honor and courage,
duty, sacrifice.

903
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:49,324
Lincoln’s son came
to understand those words...

904
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:50,826
and so have I.
