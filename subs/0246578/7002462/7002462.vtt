That's a great place to raise children.

37

- Just get out.
- Did you toilet-paper the Johnsons' house?

63
00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:51.118
- Is that why you're here?
- No.

64

No.

345
00:36:38.654 --> 00:36:42.157
I don't think about fucking my family.
That's gross.

346
00:36:42.616 --> 00:36:45.536
I'd like to hear about your friend Frank.

347
00:37:02.594 --> 00:37:04.638
(Principal) Sam Bylan.

348
00:37:14.523 --> 00:37:17.359
Cherita Chen.

349
00:37:35.127 --> 00:37:36.587
Donald Darko.

350
00:37:59.985 --> 00:38:01.570
Daye Dennis.

351
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:09.661
Hey, you fuck!

352
00:38:10.662 --> 00:38:12.915
Did you say I flooded the school?

353
00:38:15.042 --> 00:38:19.004
- I didn't say shit.
- Yeah, well, they think I did it.

354
00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:23.300
If you're innocent,
then you have nothing to worry about, right?

355
00:38:23.425 --> 00:38:25.761
Fuck you! You know what I think?

356
00:38:27.679 --> 00:38:29.932
I think you did it.

357
00:38:45.072 --> 00:38:48.325
Beer and pussy - that's all I need.

358
00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:51.495
- We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
- Smurfette?

359
00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:55.833
Mm-hm.
Not some tight-ass Middlesex chick.

360
00:38:55.999 --> 00:39:01.505
Like, this cute little blonde that'll
get down with the guys like Smurfette does.

361
00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:04.091
Smurfette doesn't fuck.

362
00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:09.888
That's bullshit.
Why do you think Papa Smurf made her?

363
00:39:10.055 --> 00:39:13.058
Because the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.

364
00:39:13.225 --> 00:39:20.148
- Not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.
- Then she fucks them while Vanity watches.

365
00:39:20.315 --> 00:39:23.527
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get some action?

366
00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:29.157
What he does, he films the gang-bang.
Later on, he beats off to the tape.

367
00:39:31.243 --> 00:39:35.122
First of all, Papa Smurf
didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did.

368
00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:39.626
She was sent as Gargamel's evil spy
to destroy the Smurf village,

369
00:39:39.793 --> 00:39:44.006
but the overwhelming goodness
of the Smurfs transformed her.

370
00:39:44.131 --> 00:39:49.803
And as for the whole gang-bang scenario,
it just couldn't happen!

371
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:56.852
Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have
reproductive organs under those little pants.

372
00:39:58.145 --> 00:40:02.149
That's what's so illogical
about being a Smurf.

373
00:40:02.357 --> 00:40:06.486
What's the point of living
if you don't have a dick?

374
00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:14.202
Donnie, why you gotta get smart on us?

375
00:40:14.328 --> 00:40:16.496
- (Horn honks)
- Grandma Death.

376
00:40:16.872 --> 00:40:20.959
(Miss Farmer) Excuse me! Excuse me!

377
00:40:21.126 --> 00:40:25.964
Please stay off the road, Miss Sparrow,
or I will call Social Services.

378
00:40:26.131 --> 00:40:29.676
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch!

379
00:40:30.385 --> 00:40:31.887
Yeah.

380
00:40:33.055 --> 00:40:35.599
- How old is Grandma Death?
- (Donnie) 101.

381
00:40:37.059 --> 00:40:39.561
She does the same thing every day.

382
00:40:40.354 --> 00:40:45.692
Just walks back and forth
and back and forth to the mailbox.

383
00:40:46.902 --> 00:40:49.363
Nothing ever in there.

384
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.910
Oh, wait, wait, wait...

385
00:40:55.702 --> 00:40:59.873
She's going back to the box.
We may still have mail.

386
00:40:59.998 --> 00:41:02.501
- Mail, mail, mail.
- Here it is.

387
00:41:02.668 --> 00:41:05.921
This could be it. Oh...?

388
00:41:06.046 --> 00:41:10.550
- Oh, no dice, Grandma. Sorry.
- Someone ought to write that bitch.

389
00:41:10.676 --> 00:41:12.928
(TV) 'Authorities continued their search

390
00:41:13.095 --> 00:41:16.515
'for a suspect
in the Middlesex Ridge School vandalism.

391
00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:21.103
"The private school has asked
for donations to restore its beloved mascot,

392
00:41:21.228 --> 00:41:23.647
'known only as the Mongrel...'

393
00:41:31.154 --> 00:41:35.534
It's very helpful.
There's a good turnout tonight.

394
00:41:37.202 --> 00:41:39.746
What are you trying to accomplish here?

395
00:41:39.913 --> 00:41:43.583
There was urine and feces
flooded in my office.

396
00:41:44.918 --> 00:41:47.004
Whatever fits.

397
00:41:48.755 --> 00:41:51.091
"Whatever fits"?

398
00:41:51.258 --> 00:41:53.844
In cooperation with the county police,

399
00:41:54.052 --> 00:41:58.348
we have begun an active investigation
into the cause of the flooding.

400
00:41:58.473 --> 00:42:02.269
And our suspects
include several of our own students...

401
00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:07.441
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

402
00:42:16.575 --> 00:42:20.245
Kitty, I would appreciate if you would wait...

403
00:42:20.412 --> 00:42:27.377
Dr Cole, not only am I a teacher,
but I am also a parent of a Middlesex child.

404
00:42:27.502 --> 00:42:33.133
Therefore I am the only person here
who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

405
00:42:36.845 --> 00:42:41.475
(Frank) 'Don't worry. You got away with it.'

406
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.062
I have in my hand Graham Greene's
"The Destructors”.

407
00:42:45.187 --> 00:42:50.317
This short story is part
of my daughter's English assignment.

408
00:42:50.484 --> 00:42:56.531
In this story, several children destroy
an elderly man's house from inside out.

409
00:42:59.951 --> 00:43:02.704
(Eerie humming)

410
00:43:10.337 --> 00:43:12.631
How can you do that?

411
00:43:19.137 --> 00:43:26.061
And how do they do this? They flood the house
by breaking through a water main.

412
00:43:27.813 --> 00:43:30.982
'I can do anything I want.

413
00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:33.610
'And so can you.'

414
00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:35.904
(Applause)

415
00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:40.367
And I think
that this garbage should be removed!

416
00:43:40.575 --> 00:43:45.247
Excuse me. What is the real issue here?
The PTA doesn't ban books.

417
00:43:45.455 --> 00:43:51.586
The PTA must acknowledge that pornography
is being taught in our curriculum!

418
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:57.342
- It's meant to be ironic.
- Excuse me. Go back to grad school.

419
00:43:57.467 --> 00:44:01.596
Why did you make me flood the school?

420
00:44:05.016 --> 00:44:07.185
They are in great danger.

421
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:10.605
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?

422
00:44:11.648 --> 00:44:14.734
I think we have all seen "Bonanza".

423
00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:21.283
Well, um... while we are on other topics...

424
00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:23.910
Where do you come from?

425
00:44:25.537 --> 00:44:28.373
'Do you believe in time travel?'

426
00:44:30.458 --> 00:44:32.752
(Sam) Who are you talking to?

427
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.509
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

428
00:44:50.228 --> 00:44:53.190
A storm is coming, Frank says.

429
00:44:53.356 --> 00:44:56.443
A storm that will swallow the children,

430
00:44:57.319 --> 00:45:01.156
And I will deliver them
from the kingdom of pain.

431
00:45:01.323 --> 00:45:07.579
I'll deliver them back to their doorsteps,
send the monsters back to the underground.

432
00:45:07.746 --> 00:45:11.875
I'll send them back to a place
where no one else can see them.

433
00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:14.336
Except for me.

434
00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.340
Because I am Donnie Darko.

435
00:45:26.681 --> 00:45:28.141
Who is Frank?

436
00:45:35.023 --> 00:45:38.485
- A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
- (Giggling)

437
00:45:43.782 --> 00:45:49.746
'In these modern times, our attitude
and beliefs are so delicate, so fragile.'

438
00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:55.252
'I have had a Cunning Vision.
This vision has released me.'

439
00:45:55.418 --> 00:46:00.715
'It's important that our lifeline be
rejuvenated, so that we can breathe again.

440
00:46:00.882 --> 00:46:02.968
'It's time to breathe.'

441
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.221
'It is time to breathe.'

442
00:46:06.763 --> 00:46:08.890
"Thank you, Jim Cunningham.'

443
00:46:10.016 --> 00:46:12.519
"Thank you, Jim Cunningham.'

444
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:18.900
'So now let us begin Lifeline Exercise
Number One. Please press stop now.'

445
00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:31.830
As you can see, the lifeline
is divided into two polar extremes.

446
00:46:31.997 --> 00:46:34.040
Fear and love.

447
00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:38.712
Fear is in the negative energy spectrum.

448
00:46:38.962 --> 00:46:43.091
- Love is in the positive energy spectrum.
- No, duh.

449
00:46:43.341 --> 00:46:48.096
Excuse me?
"No, duh” is a product of fear.

450
00:46:49.514 --> 00:46:56.313
Now, on each card is a character dilemma
which applies to the lifeline.

451
00:46:59.441 --> 00:47:02.944
Please... Take this. Thank you.

452
00:47:03.611 --> 00:47:06.489
Please read each character dilemma aloud

453
00:47:06.614 --> 00:47:10.910
and place an X on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

454
00:47:11.786 --> 00:47:13.663
Cherita?

455
00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:24.591
"Juanita has an important math test today.

456
00:47:24.799 --> 00:47:29.429
"She's known about the test
for several weeks, but has not studied.

457
00:47:29.596 --> 00:47:36.436
"In order to keep from failing,
Juanita decides to cheat on the math test.”

458
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:42.025
Good. Good. Very good.

459
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:44.069
Mr Darko.

460
00:47:52.077 --> 00:47:54.829
"Ling Ling finds a wallet filled with money.

461
00:47:54.996 --> 00:47:59.709
"She takes it to the address on the driver's
license but keeps the money."”

462
00:48:00.919 --> 00:48:03.671
I'm sorry, Miss Farmer. I don't get this.

463
00:48:03.797 --> 00:48:06.800
Just place an "X" in the appropriate place.

464
00:48:07.759 --> 00:48:13.348
I know what to do, but you can't lump things
into two categories.

465
00:48:13.556 --> 00:48:17.143
The lifeline is divided that way.

466
00:48:17.352 --> 00:48:19.979
Well, life isn't that simple. I mean...

467
00:48:20.146 --> 00:48:25.610
Who cares if Ling Ling keeps the money?
It has nothing to do with fear or love.

468
00:48:25.735 --> 00:48:31.699
- They are the deepest human emotions.
- OK. But you're not listening to me.

469
00:48:31.866 --> 00:48:36.955
There are other things to take into account,
the whole spectrum of human emotion.

470
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:41.626
You can't just lump everything
into two categories and deny everything else!

471
00:48:41.751 --> 00:48:46.005
If you don't complete the assignment,
you'll get a zero.

472
00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:54.389
Donald, let me preface this by saying

473
00:48:54.514 --> 00:49:00.270
that your Iowa Test scores are... intimidating.

474
00:49:02.397 --> 00:49:04.065
So...

475
00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:09.529
Let's go over this again.
What exactly did you say to Miss Farmer?

476
00:49:11.865 --> 00:49:17.871
I'll tell you. He asked me to forcibly insert
the lifeline exercise card into my anus!

477
00:49:17.996 --> 00:49:20.707
(Stifles laughter with cough)

478
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:39.934
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values...

479
00:49:43.688 --> 00:49:47.233
Kitty... Excuse us, please.

480
00:49:51.446 --> 00:49:55.366
They've suspended him
from after-school activities for six months.

481
00:49:59.078 --> 00:50:02.957
Since this jet engine fiasco,
I don't know what's gotten into...

482
00:50:03.124 --> 00:50:09.464
I'll say this because our daughters are
on the dance team together and I respect you,

483
00:50:09.631 --> 00:50:15.094
but after witnessing your son's behavior,
I have significant doubts about your...

484
00:50:17.472 --> 00:50:22.936
Our paths through life must be righteous.
Go home and look in the mirror

485
00:50:23.144 --> 00:50:27.982
and pray that your son doesn't succumb
to the path of fear.

486
00:50:32.153 --> 00:50:38.451
Do you remember
that weird gym teacher, Mrs Farmer?

487
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:43.873
Yeah. OK, well, my brother told her
to shove a book up her ass today.

488
00:50:43.998 --> 00:50:48.044
And then my parents
just bought him all this new shit.

489
00:50:48.169 --> 00:50:53.007
Yeah, I know.
I wish a jet engine would fall on my room.

490
00:51:09.899 --> 00:51:12.318
- Dr Monnitoff.
- Donnie.

491
00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:13.945
Um...

492
00:51:14.112 --> 00:51:17.156
I know this is gonna
sound kind of weird, but, uh,

493
00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:20.827
do you know anything about...
time travel?

494
00:51:26.332 --> 00:51:29.377
(Monnitoff) A wormhole
with an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

495
00:51:29.627 --> 00:51:34.173
which is theoretically
a wormhole in space controlled by man.

496
00:51:36.843 --> 00:51:42.348
So, according to Hawking,
a wormhole may be able to provide a short cut

497
00:51:42.515 --> 00:51:45.435
for jumping
between two distant regions of space-time.

498
00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:50.857
So to travel back in time, you have to have
a spaceship faster than the speed of light.

499
00:51:51.065 --> 00:51:54.152
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a wormhole.

500
00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:57.030
The basic principles of time travel are there.

501
00:51:57.196 --> 00:52:01.034
Your vessel and portal.
Your vessel can be anything.

502
00:52:01.159 --> 00:52:04.370
- Like a DeLorean?
- Metal craft of any kind.

503
00:52:04.537 --> 00:52:10.501
You know, I love that movie.
It's so... like, futuristic, you know?

504
00:52:11.878 --> 00:52:15.965
Listen, um...
don't tell anybody that I gave you this.

505
00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:21.638
Woman who wrote this used to teach here.
She was a nun long before that.

506
00:52:21.763 --> 00:52:26.684
Then overnight
she became this entirely different person.

507
00:52:26.851 --> 00:52:30.313
She up and left the church,
wrote this book...

508
00:52:31.272 --> 00:52:34.817
She started teaching science,
right here at Middlesex.

509
00:52:35.943 --> 00:52:38.196
"The Philosophy Of Time Travel".

510
00:52:39.947 --> 00:52:42.033
Roberta Sparrow?

511
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.118
That's right.

512
00:52:47.538 --> 00:52:49.415
Roberta Sparrow?

513
00:53:08.976 --> 00:53:11.104
Roberta Sparrow.

514
00:53:12.563 --> 00:53:14.649
Grandma Death.

515
00:53:33.835 --> 00:53:37.171
It's called "The Philosophy Of Time Travel".

516
00:53:37.296 --> 00:53:41.926
- What does philosophy have to do with it?
- Guess who wrote it.

517
00:53:42.093 --> 00:53:43.511
Who?

518
00:53:44.429 --> 00:53:47.849
Roberta Sparrow. Huh! She wrote a book.

519
00:53:48.683 --> 00:53:52.937
- Grandma Death wrote a book.
- That's a terrible nickname.

520
00:53:53.938 --> 00:53:57.275
We almost ran her down the other day.

521
00:53:57.442 --> 00:54:02.488
She lives in that piece of crap house,
and you know she's loaded.

522
00:54:02.655 --> 00:54:07.452
- You're right.
- She was known for her gem collection.

523
00:54:07.618 --> 00:54:13.416
Kids used to go up there all the time
and try to steal stuff from her.

524
00:54:13.541 --> 00:54:15.710
She became a total recluse.

525
00:54:17.003 --> 00:54:22.383
Huh! I didn't know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down.

526
00:54:26.053 --> 00:54:29.807
(Donnie)
'She was just standing in the road, frozen.

527
00:54:29.974 --> 00:54:33.186
'I walked over to see if she was OK.'

528
00:54:33.311 --> 00:54:35.813
And she whispered in my ear.

529
00:54:35.938 --> 00:54:39.734
- What did she say?
- I think Frank wants me to talk to her.

530
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:43.738
He asked if I knew about time travel.

531
00:54:43.905 --> 00:54:49.619
She wrote a book about it,
so that can't be a coincidence, right?

532
00:54:50.828 --> 00:54:52.955
What did she say to you?

533
00:54:54.916 --> 00:54:58.419
She said that every living creature
on earth dies alone.

534
00:55:02.548 --> 00:55:04.717
How did that make you feel?

535
00:55:09.055 --> 00:55:12.058
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

536
00:55:13.142 --> 00:55:18.898
She died when I was eight
and she crawled underneath the... the porch.

537
00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:24.695
To die.

538
00:55:26.948 --> 00:55:29.367
To be alone.

539
00:55:30.034 --> 00:55:32.912
Do you feel alone right now?

540
00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.919
I don't know...

541
00:55:41.796 --> 00:55:45.675
I'd like to believe I'm not, but I just...

542
00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:51.305
I've just never seen any proof,
so I just don't debate it any more.

543
00:55:51.472 --> 00:55:57.979
I could spend my whole life debating it
over and over and still wouldn't have proof,

544
00:55:58.145 --> 00:56:01.691
so I just don't debate it any more.

545
00:56:01.816 --> 00:56:03.985
It's absurd.

546
00:56:07.071 --> 00:56:08.781
The search for God is absurd?

547
00:56:11.826 --> 00:56:14.745
It is if everyone dies alone.

548
00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:16.998
Does that scare you?

549
00:56:20.334 --> 00:56:23.087
I don't want to be alone.

550
00:56:26.841 --> 00:56:29.260

551
00:56:35.433 --> 00:56:38.144

552
00:56:38.352 --> 00:56:44.108
that for the last 39 years,
I have been a prisoner of my own fear.

553
00:56:44.275 --> 00:56:46.319
Fear.

554
00:56:46.485 --> 00:56:49.488
You have got to meet this Jim Cunningham.

555
00:56:50.656 --> 00:56:53.367
I can't believe he's single.

- Shit, we need a quarterback.

What if you could go back in time
and take those hours of pain

575
00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:58.636
and replace them with something better?

576
00:59:58.803 --> 01:00:02.264
- Like images?
- Yeah, a Hawaiian sunset

577
01:00:02.431 --> 01:00:04.308
or the Grand Canyon.

578
01:00:04.475 --> 01:00:10.147
- Things that remind you how beautiful...
- We've been going together for two weeks.

579
01:00:10.314 --> 01:00:12.024
Yeah?

580
01:00:14.235 --> 01:00:17.363
Well, I er... I...

581
01:00:18.239 --> 01:00:20.407
You want to kiss me?

582
01:00:27.873 --> 01:00:30.960
- I'm sorry, ...
- Look, Donnie, wait. I just...

583
01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:36.882
- Well, I like you a lot.
- I just want it to be at a time when... it...

584
01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:41.262
- When what?
- When it reminds me just...

585
01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:45.474
When it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be?

586
01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:48.227
Yeah.

587
01:00:49.019 --> 01:00:52.106
And there's some fat guy staring at us.

588
01:01:21.051 --> 01:01:27.183
I don't think telling any woman
to forcibly insert an object up her anus

589
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:31.228
is something
that should go without consequence.

590
01:01:34.398 --> 01:01:37.443
I think we should buy him a moped.

591
01:01:39.528 --> 01:01:42.239
I think we should get a divorce.

592
01:01:53.626 --> 01:01:57.463
- You won't tell Mom, will you?
- Why would 1?

593
01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:00.799
- You tell Mom everything.
- No, I don't.

594
01:02:03.969 --> 01:02:07.973
- Let me see it.
- No, it's not finished. It's...

595
01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.975
OK. It's cool.

596
01:02:15.981 --> 01:02:18.359
That's scary.

597
01:02:20.986 --> 01:02:23.197
You think?

598
01:02:23.697 --> 01:02:27.534
Thank you for seeing us at such late notice.

599
01:02:27.701 --> 01:02:34.416
- We both felt we should come and discuss...
- What I think is going on with your son.

600
01:02:34.541 --> 01:02:36.293
Yes.

601
01:02:37.044 --> 01:02:40.547
Um... Well, he's er...

602
01:02:42.466 --> 01:02:45.886
You know about his past,
and he was suspended from school

603
01:02:46.053 --> 01:02:48.180
for insulting his gym teacher.

604
01:02:48.305 --> 01:02:52.893
I'm not sure that's a good example.
I think he had just cause.

605
01:02:53.018 --> 01:02:57.189
Rose, let me lay out
what I believe is happening here.

606
01:03:00.442 --> 01:03:08.117
Donnie's aggressive behavior...
his increased detachment from reality,

607
01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:13.539
seem to stem from his inability
to cope with the forces in the world

608
01:03:13.747 --> 01:03:16.041
that he perceives to be threatening.

609
01:03:21.797 --> 01:03:24.008
Has he ever told you about Frank?

610
01:03:28.762 --> 01:03:30.931
Frank?

611
01:03:31.181 --> 01:03:33.017
Yes, the giant bunny rabbit.

612
01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:35.769
The what?

613
01:03:40.274 --> 01:03:45.362
I don't recall
him ever having mentioned a rabbit.

614
01:03:45.529 --> 01:03:50.117
Donnie is experiencing what is
commonly called a daylight hallucination.

615
01:04:04.298 --> 01:04:08.427
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

616
01:04:10.387 --> 01:04:16.268
- What can we do?
- I would like to do more hypnotherapy...

617
01:04:18.437 --> 01:04:20.773
and increase his medication.

618
01:04:27.654 --> 01:04:33.202
Whatever will help him, really, is...
That's why we're here.

619
01:04:33.327 --> 01:04:38.832
We just would like him
to experience some relief.

620
01:04:38.999 --> 01:04:43.045
So if you think
that more medication will do that,

621
01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:47.925
then I think we should give it a try.

622
01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:58.310
It's complicated.

623
01:04:58.477 --> 01:05:00.187
Yeah?

624
01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:04.650
There's like a force in your brain
that just sends you some place.

625
01:05:05.192 --> 01:05:08.237
Do you go some place familiar?

626
01:05:08.362 --> 01:05:13.075
No, but each time I keep waking up
farther from my house.

627
01:05:14.785 --> 01:05:16.912
(Gretchen) Scary.

628
01:05:18.831 --> 01:05:21.750
(Distant thunder rumbles)

629
01:05:28.966 --> 01:05:31.468
Donnie Darko.

630
01:05:34.596 --> 01:05:36.807
I Know.

631
01:05:36.974 --> 01:05:39.601
(They chuckle)

632
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:47.943
- Good morning, you mongrels!
- Good morning.

633
01:05:48.068 --> 01:05:51.113
Is that all you can muster? Good morning!

634
01:05:51.238 --> 01:05:55.951
- Good morning!
- Now, that's a tiny, tiny bit better.

635
01:05:56.118 --> 01:06:01.457
But I still sense some students
who are actually afraid to say "good morning".

636
01:06:01.623 --> 01:06:03.417
Good morning!

637
01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:08.714
Yeah, that's what I like to hear!
Too many young men and women today

638
01:06:08.922 --> 01:06:11.675
are completely paralyzed by their fears.

639
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:17.097
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction

640
01:06:17.347 --> 01:06:19.766
of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex.

641
01:06:21.518 --> 01:06:25.147
Now, I'm going to tell you a little story today.

642
01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:29.067
It's a heartbreakingly sad story
about a young man

643
01:06:29.193 --> 01:06:33.864
whose life was completely destroyed
by these instruments of fear,

644
01:06:34.072 --> 01:06:39.328
a young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.

645
01:06:40.078 --> 01:06:42.706
His name was Frank.

646
01:06:52.841 --> 01:06:56.261
- We're moving through time.
- What?

647
01:06:56.386 --> 01:06:58.597
(Feedback whines)

648
01:06:58.722 --> 01:07:03.101
Hi. My stepsister, like,
I sometimes worry that she eats too much.

649
01:07:03.268 --> 01:07:05.521
- Shut up, Kim!
- I'm just trying to help.

650
01:07:05.646 --> 01:07:10.025
Oh, sweetheart, please!
There's no reason to be embarrassed here.

651
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:16.532
Many times we eat because
we are afraid to face our ego reflection.

652
01:07:16.657 --> 01:07:22.454
We find ourselves looking at the mirror,
rather than into and through the mirror.

653
01:07:22.621 --> 01:07:27.292
When we do that,
we can finally see how beautiful we are.

654
01:07:28.168 --> 01:07:31.296
- Thanks!
- Sure. Come up here. Don't be afraid.

655
01:07:37.302 --> 01:07:40.806
Er, how can I find out
what I wanna be when I grow up?

656
01:07:40.931 --> 01:07:48.230
Oh! That's a hard one. Well, look deep
inside of yourself, deep within your heart,

657
01:07:48.355 --> 01:07:55.362
and find what makes you feel love -
pure, unconditional love - and go to that.

658
01:07:55.571 --> 01:08:00.409
In your studies, in your athletics,
in your relationships, go towards love.

659
01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:03.078
- Thank you.
- Come on up.

660
01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:07.749
Next.

661
01:08:12.337 --> 01:08:17.259
- How do I learn how to fight?
- "How do I learn how to fight?"

662
01:08:17.509 --> 01:08:23.223
Son, violence is a product of fear.
Learn to truly love yourself -

663
01:08:24.016 --> 01:08:27.477
Truly love yourself -
and the world will be yours.

664
01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:29.855
- OK.
- Get yourself up here!

665
01:08:31.481 --> 01:08:33.525
All right!

666
01:08:36.486 --> 01:08:38.822
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

667
01:08:38.989 --> 01:08:43.243
Um... How much are they paying you
to be here?

668
01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:46.079
Er... Excuse me?

669
01:08:47.539 --> 01:08:50.542
- What's your name, son?
- Gerald.

670
01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:53.795
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.

671
01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:59.343
Do you want us to buy your book?
Because that was the worst advice ever.

672
01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.764
See how sad this is?
Want your sister to lose weight?

673
01:09:03.972 --> 01:09:07.809
Tell her to stop eating Twinkies
and play field hockey.

674
01:09:07.934 --> 01:09:14.107
No one knows what they want to be.
It takes time to find that out. Right, Jim?

675
01:09:14.232 --> 01:09:16.360
And you...

676
01:09:16.526 --> 01:09:18.278
Yeah, you.

677
01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:23.700
Sick of some jerk shoving your head
down the toilet? Well, lift some weights

678
01:09:23.825 --> 01:09:28.997
or take a karate lesson,
and next time kick him in the balls.

679
01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:35.629
Son... See this? This is an anger prisoner,
a textbook example.

680
01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:39.132
- Prisoner.
- Do you see the fear, people?

681
01:09:39.383 --> 01:09:44.805
This boy is scared to death.
Son, it breaks my heart to say this,

682
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:48.975
but I believe you're a very troubled
and confused young man.

683
01:09:49.226 --> 01:09:53.397
- You are searching in all the wrong places.
- You're right, actually.

684
01:09:53.563 --> 01:09:56.817
I am pretty troubled and pretty confused.

685
01:09:57.025 --> 01:10:01.405
And I'm afraid, really, really afraid.
Really afraid, but I... I...

686
01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:04.491
I think you're the fucking Antichrist.

687
01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.665
(Cheering)

688
01:10:17.003 --> 01:10:22.801
It's amazing. He thinks he's telling the truth.
Everything he says is a fucking lie.

689
01:10:23.009 --> 01:10:25.178
Everything he says!

690
01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:29.474
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a fucking chud...

691
01:10:29.599 --> 01:10:32.144
Are you OK?

692
01:10:35.439 --> 01:10:38.066
Sit down. Calm down.

693
01:10:43.196 --> 01:10:45.532
You ever hear of Grandma Death?

694
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.577
Who?

695
01:10:53.498 --> 01:10:57.544
"The Philosophy Of Time Travel".
What is this?

696
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:59.796
She wrote it.

697
01:11:08.847 --> 01:11:12.309
I'm... I'm seeing stuff...

698
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.062
Like really messed-up stuff.

699
01:11:16.188 --> 01:11:21.443
That book describes stuff I've been seeing,
and it can't just be a coincidence.

700
01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.580
(Bell clangs)

701
01:11:33.705 --> 01:11:36.708
She must be in. She never leaves this house.

702
01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:39.669
Maybe she's asleep.

703
01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:01.441
Donnie, look.

704
01:12:11.284 --> 01:12:14.037
(Frank) 'Send her a letter.'

705
01:12:41.106 --> 01:12:45.235
(Monnitoff) 'Each vessel travels
along a vector through space-time,

706
01:12:45.402 --> 01:12:47.153
'along its centre of gravity.'

707
01:12:47.279 --> 01:12:49.614
Like a spear.

708
01:12:50.782 --> 01:12:54.244
- Pardon?
- Like a spear coming out of your chest.

709
01:12:55.412 --> 01:12:58.081
Um... Sure. Yeah.

710
01:12:58.248 --> 01:13:03.879
In order for the vessel to travel through time,
it's got to find a portal, a wormhole or...

711
01:13:04.004 --> 01:13:09.801
Could these portals...? Could these portals
just appear anywhere, any time?

712
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:12.053
I think that's highly unlikely.

713
01:13:12.178 --> 01:13:18.226
- No, you're talking about an act of God.
- If God controls time, time is pre-decided.

714
01:13:20.312 --> 01:13:24.482
- I'm not following you.
- Every living thing follows a set path.

715
01:13:25.275 --> 01:13:30.822
And if you could see your path,
then you could see the future?

716
01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:35.827
- That's a form of time travel.
- Well, you're contradicting yourself.

717
01:13:36.036 --> 01:13:40.457
If we were able to see our destinies
manifest themselves visually,

718
01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:45.003
then we would be given a choice
to betray our destinies.

719
01:13:45.128 --> 01:13:51.051
The mere fact that this choice exists would
make all preformed destiny come to an end.

720
01:13:51.217 --> 01:13:55.055
Not if you travel within God's channel.

721
01:13:58.016 --> 01:14:02.187
I'm not going to be able
to continue this conversation.

722
01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:07.359
- Why?
- I could lose my job.

723
01:14:09.319 --> 01:14:11.237
OK.

724
01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:25.835
It gives me no pleasure to deny you
one of the great writers of the 20th century.

725
01:14:26.002 --> 01:14:32.425
Alas, I have not yet been elected queen
of the universe, so I must obey the rules.

726
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:39.599
So, anyone seen in this school
reading this book will be suspended.

727
01:14:39.766 --> 01:14:46.106
Not to worry. Someone pre-ordered
a dozen copies at the Sarasota Mall bookstore.

728
01:14:47.774 --> 01:14:53.780
In Mr Greene's absence, we will now be
reading another classic - "Watership Down".

729
01:14:58.785 --> 01:15:00.870
Here, Donnie.

730
01:15:01.037 --> 01:15:03.123
Pass these back.

731
01:15:04.332 --> 01:15:07.961
Maybe you and Frank
can read this one together.

732
01:16:18.239 --> 01:16:20.325
(Chuckles)

733
01:16:20.492 --> 01:16:23.286
(Frank) 'Now you know where he lives.'

734
01:16:24.829 --> 01:16:29.209
And they grow
out of our... chest, solar plexus?

735
01:16:29.334 --> 01:16:33.797
Just like she described,
the way they moved and they smelled.

736
01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.049
It's like they're workers.

737
01:16:37.175 --> 01:16:41.763
Assigned to each one of us.
They just... They're like liquid.

738
01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:48.061
I followed it into my parents' bedroom.

739
01:16:48.895 --> 01:16:50.980
What did you find?

740
01:16:55.568 --> 01:16:57.445
Nothing.

741
01:17:01.157 --> 01:17:03.910
So we call them IMGs.

742
01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:08.832
- Infant Memory Generators.
- You buy these glasses for your infant,

743
01:17:08.998 --> 01:17:12.377
and they wear them at night when they sleep.

744
01:17:12.544 --> 01:17:16.297
But inside the glasses
are these slide photographs.

745
01:17:16.464 --> 01:17:21.803
Each photograph is of something peaceful
or beautiful, whatever the parents want.

746
01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:24.556
What effect would it have on an infant?

747
01:17:24.764 --> 01:17:29.978
Well, nobody remembers their infancy.
Anybody who says they do is lying.

748
01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:33.690
So, this will help develop memory
earlier in life.

749
01:17:33.898 --> 01:17:35.275
Yeah.

750
01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:40.864
Did you consider that infants need darkness
as part of their natural development?

751
01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:46.452
No.

752
01:17:49.122 --> 01:17:50.540
Yeah.

753
01:17:50.707 --> 01:17:55.503
What if the parents put in pictures
of Satan or dead people?

754
01:17:55.628 --> 01:17:58.089
Is that what you'd show your kids?

755
01:17:59.883 --> 01:18:04.929
Er, well, I mean,
didn't your dad, like, stab your mom?

756
01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:11.603
(Mock screeching)

757
01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:15.899
Get out.

758
01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:19.319
Gretchen!

759
01:18:19.485 --> 01:18:23.198
Gretchen! Gretchen.
I'm sorry about those guys.

760
01:18:51.142 --> 01:18:54.562
- Two for "Evil Dead", please.
- That'll be $2.

762
01:19:42.527 --> 01:19:45.613
Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?

763
01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:53.705
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?

764
01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:05.591
Take it off.

765
01:20:25.445 --> 01:20:28.072
What happened to your eye?

766
01:20:43.212 --> 01:20:45.340
Why do they call you Frank?

767
01:20:46.966 --> 01:20:49.677
It is the name of my father.

768
01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:54.057
And his father before me.

769
01:20:58.353 --> 01:20:59.812
Frank...

770
01:21:03.316 --> 01:21:05.443
when's this going to stop?

771
01:21:05.985 --> 01:21:08.112
You should already know that.

772
01:21:11.657 --> 01:21:13.951
Watch the movie screen.

773
01:21:16.287 --> 01:21:19.457
There's something I want to show you.

774
01:21:27.256 --> 01:21:29.384
Have you ever seen a portal?

775
01:21:36.516 --> 01:21:39.685
(Clock chimes)

776
01:21:50.029 --> 01:21:51.864
Burn it to the ground.

777

() Woman singing gentle melody)

778
01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:10.568
OK. Now, girls, I want you to concentrate.

779
01:23:10.735 --> 01:23:12.945
Failure is not an option.

780
01:23:13.112 --> 01:23:18.618
And, Bethany, if you feel the need
to vomit up there, just swallow it.

781
01:23:18.743 --> 01:23:23.080
- OK, Mom.
- Hey, you guys, good luck out there.

782
01:24:02.078 --> 01:24:04.455
Now, that was really something.

783
01:24:04.622 --> 01:24:07.708
Thank you, Cherita Chen, with "Autumn Angel".

784
01:24:07.875 --> 01:24:11.087

that you missed her big show last night.

- Dad?

is that almost all of those people

They're all part
of this great big conspiracy of bullshit.

01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:50.295
has been invited to perform
on "Star Search '88" in Los Angeles.

847
01:32:16.363 --> 01:32:20.951
- 'I know now a terrible thing is coming.'
- 'What do you mean?'

848
01:32:23.454 --> 01:32:27.916
"The field, the field.
It's covered with blood.'

849
01:32:28.584 --> 01:32:31.837
'Blood? Don't be silly.'

850
01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:48.687
'All right. It's getting dark.
We should get back to the burrow.'

851
01:32:48.854 --> 01:32:53.692
'Back to the burrow?
It'll come there. It's all around us!'

852
01:32:53.859 --> 01:32:57.321
- 'Stop it, Fiver.'
- 'We've got to leave here.'

853
01:33:05.704 --> 01:33:10.125
When the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision,
do they believe him?

854
01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:12.836
Why should we care?

855
01:33:13.837 --> 01:33:16.131
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

856
01:33:17.216 --> 01:33:19.510
Why should I mourn for a rabbit?

857
01:33:19.635 --> 01:33:23.806
Is the death of one species
less tragic than another?

858
01:33:23.972 --> 01:33:27.226
Of course. A rabbit's not like us.

859
01:33:27.351 --> 01:33:32.356
It has no history books, no photographs,
no knowledge of sorrow or regret.

860
01:33:32.523 --> 01:33:37.986
I'm sorry. Don't get me wrong,
I like rabbits. They're cute and horny.

861
01:33:38.153 --> 01:33:42.741
If you're cute and horny, you're happy.
You don't know why you're alive.

862
01:33:42.908 --> 01:33:47.704
You just want to have sex
as many times as possible before you die.

863
01:33:47.871 --> 01:33:52.084
I just don't see the point
in crying over a dead rabbit...

864
01:33:52.292 --> 01:33:55.337
who never even feared death to begin with.

865
01:33:57.131 --> 01:34:02.219
You're wrong. These rabbits
are the product of the author's imagination.

866
01:34:02.386 --> 01:34:08.183
He cares for them, so we care for them,
otherwise we've just missed the point.

867
01:34:10.561 --> 01:34:14.064
Aren't we forgetting
about the miracle of storytelling?

868
01:34:15.899 --> 01:34:19.528
The deus ex machina? The god machine?

869
01:34:21.321 --> 01:34:23.907
That's what saved the rabbits.

870
01:34:30.581 --> 01:34:34.001
No, it was ridiculous. I'll call you back.

871
01:34:35.627 --> 01:34:38.463
- Rose.
- Kitty.

872
01:34:39.756 --> 01:34:43.510
I'm sure you've heard the horrible allegations
against Jim Cunningham.

873
01:34:43.635 --> 01:34:47.055
I know.
Something about a kiddie porn dungeon...

874
01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:50.517
Oh, please, please! Don't use those words!

875
01:34:51.476 --> 01:34:55.355
It's obviously a conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man.

876
01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.402
I'm spearheading the
Jim Cunningham defense scampaign.

877
01:35:02.654 --> 01:35:07.117
Rose, I have to appear
at his arraignment tomorrow morning.

878
01:35:07.326 --> 01:35:10.746
The girls have to leave for Los Angeles.

879
01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:15.626
As their coach,
I was the obvious choice to chaperone them.

880
01:35:15.834 --> 01:35:19.838
- But now you can't go.
- Yes.

881
01:35:19.963 --> 01:35:24.968
Now, believe me, of all the other mothers,
I would never dream of asking you.

882
01:35:25.135 --> 01:35:28.096
But none of the others are available.

883
01:35:30.849 --> 01:35:35.479
I don't know, Kitty.
It's a bad weekend. Eddie's in New York.

884
01:35:36.355 --> 01:35:43.904
Rose, I don't know if you realize
what an opportunity this is for our daughters!

885
01:35:44.154 --> 01:35:49.534
This has been a dream of Samantha's
and all of ours for a long time.

886
01:35:49.701 --> 01:35:53.038
I made her lead dancer!

887
01:35:53.163 --> 01:35:57.960
Sometimes I doubt your commitment
to Sparkle Motion!

888
01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:30.409
Elizabeth will be in charge.

889
01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:34.371
She'll drive you to therapy.

890
01:36:34.496 --> 01:36:40.085
And if you need anything,
you promise me that you will call Dr Thurman?

891
01:36:49.428 --> 01:36:53.098
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?

892
01:36:58.228 --> 01:37:00.397
It feels wonderful.

893
01:37:32.512 --> 01:37:36.350
Here... Sorry! Here you are!

894
01:37:36.558 --> 01:37:40.729
- You guys are gonna win. I know it.
- (Sam) So do.

895
01:37:40.896 --> 01:37:45.275
Here's the keys.
There's food in the fridge and do not...

896
01:37:45.442 --> 01:37:48.195
Mom, go. You're gonna miss your plane.

897
01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:51.406
Mom, I need...

898
01:37:52.491 --> 01:37:55.660
There's nothing broken in my brain.

899
01:37:56.078 --> 01:37:58.497
- I know.
- Bye, Donnie.

900
01:38:03.710 --> 01:38:06.922
OK, go. Go!

901
01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:31.488
Hello, Donnie.

902
01:38:31.696 --> 01:38:36.785
It's Friday. Shouldn't you be off
with your friends, scaring old people?

903
01:38:41.623 --> 01:38:47.462
- What's going on?
- I don't know. That's a good question.

904
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:51.842
I'm no longer your English teacher.
They fired me.

905
01:38:53.135 --> 01:38:57.305
That's bullshit!
You're the only good teacher here.

906
01:39:00.058 --> 01:39:01.935
Thank you.

907
01:39:03.562 --> 01:39:05.480
What's "cellar door"?

908
01:39:07.566 --> 01:39:12.779
This famous linguist once said that
of all the phrases in the English language,

909
01:39:12.904 --> 01:39:17.659
of all the endless combinations of words
in all of history,

910
01:39:17.784 --> 01:39:20.954
"cellar door" is the most beautiful.

911
01:39:23.331 --> 01:39:25.250
"Cellar door."

912
01:39:56.740 --> 01:40:01.119
I promise that one day
everything's gonna be better for you.

913
01:40:03.121 --> 01:40:05.457
Shut up!

914
01:40:18.386 --> 01:40:22.724
- (Dr Thurman) 'I want to talk about your past.'
- (Donnie) 'No.'

915
01:40:22.891 --> 01:40:26.686
'I want to talk about you and your parents.'

916
01:40:26.811 --> 01:40:30.565
(Donnie) They didn't buy me
what I wanted for Christmas.

917
01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:34.736
What did you want for Christmas that year?

918
01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:38.448
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

919
01:40:40.075 --> 01:40:44.246
How did you feel,
being denied these Hungry Hungry Hippos?

920
01:40:45.288 --> 01:40:49.709
- Regret.
- What else makes you feel regret?

921
01:40:52.003 --> 01:40:56.508
- That I did it again.
- You did it again?

922
01:40:57.467 --> 01:41:03.014
I flooded my school
and I burned down that pervert's house.

923
01:41:03.139 --> 01:41:07.769
(Laughs) I only have a few days left
before they catch me.

924
01:41:07.894 --> 01:41:14.109
- Did Frank tell you to do these things?
- I have to obey him. He saved my life.

925
01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:18.238
I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone.

926
01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:25.370
And then... And then I won't be able
to figure out what this is all about.

927
01:41:25.537 --> 01:41:28.206
I won't know his master plan.

928
01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:32.294
Do you mean God's master plan?

929
01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:35.922
Do you now believe in God?

930
01:41:36.047 --> 01:41:39.676
I have the power to build a time machine.

931
01:41:39.884 --> 01:41:42.053
How is that possible?

932
01:41:44.139 --> 01:41:47.851
How is time travel possible, Donnie?

933
01:41:48.018 --> 01:41:50.145
Time's up, Frank said.

934
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:53.940
- When is this going to happen?
- Soon.

935
01:42:15.170 --> 01:42:17.672
What is going to happen?

936
01:42:21.051 --> 01:42:25.263
- Frank is gonna Kill.
- Who is he going to kill?

937
01:42:29.017 --> 01:42:32.354
- Who is he going to kill?
- I can see him!

938
01:42:37.776 --> 01:42:39.861
The sky's gonna open up.

939
01:42:46.993 --> 01:42:53.041
If the sky suddenly opened up,
there would be no law, no rule.

940
01:42:53.208 --> 01:42:56.920
There would only be you and your memories,

941
01:42:57.087 --> 01:43:01.132
the choices you've made
and the people you've touched.

942
01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:08.306
If this world were to end,
there would only be you and him...

943
01:43:09.474 --> 01:43:11.976
and no one else.

944
01:43:40.505 --> 01:43:43.216
You can stop taking your medication.

945
01:43:43.383 --> 01:43:46.594
They're placebos.
Just pills made out of water.

946

Donnie...

948
01:43:56.271 --> 01:44:01.151
An atheist is someone who denies altogether
the existence of God.

949
01:44:01.359 --> 01:44:04.028
You're an agnostic.

950
01:44:04.195 --> 01:44:07.198
An agnostic is someone...

951
01:44:07.365 --> 01:44:11.536
who believes that there is
no proof of the existence of God,

952
01:44:11.661 --> 01:44:16.791
but does not deny a possibility
that God exists.

953
01:44:24.090 --> 01:44:26.760

and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.

963
01:45:48.716 --> 01:45:51.261

964
