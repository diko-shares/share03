00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:59,059
And another thing I must tell you,
my dearest Katerina Matveyevna:

2
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:04,731
you're appearing to me
as a purest swan,

3
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:11,363
like you swim to wherever you need
to go, or on your errands...

4
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,226
only it takes my breath away,
so happy I feel,

5
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:18,495
as though I was shot pointblank
from a cannon.

6
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:31,902

16
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,298
You should know,
my dearest Katerina Matveyevna,

17
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:38,611
that to date, the class battles have
been completed by and large,

18
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,448
and the day of worldwide liberation
is coming.

19
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,562
So it's now time for me
to come back home

20
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,481
and build a new life

21
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,458
in my native land,
so dear to my heart.

22
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,968
Two o'clock.

23
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,139
Have you been here long?

24
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,111
It's just my luck!

25
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,508
Back in hospital I'd sworn to myself:
as soon as I have a discharge,

26
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:26,143
I'll go straight home,
and not get into any mess.

27
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,783
I've dug up two like you,
and nothing happened...

28
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,795
But the third one...

29
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,481
I pulled him out, and he got at my
throat. A bandit he was.

30
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:43,569
That's how it turned out. Buried by
his own. I hardly beat him off.

31
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:53,913
Now I'll dig you up,
and good bye.

32
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,627
THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN

33
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,658
Hands down!

34
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,768
A real beast...
that Black Abdullah.

35
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,505
Has no pity for anyone.

36
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:05,234
If we came here a bit later,
he would've killed all of them.

37
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,958
Why did he do it, Commander?
What for?

38
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,103
He's a bandit!

39
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:19,832
When we finally got to these parts,
Abdullah decided to go abroad

40
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,212
and shoot his harem...
so that no man would have them.

41
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,774
No, with the women,
we can't catch up with Abdullah.

42
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:33,330
That's why he wanted to do away with
them, because they hindered him.

43
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,056
But we can't abandon them either.

44
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,483
Here, some dried bread and barley
for your trip.

45
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,265
I'm being late. Discharged six months
ago, I still knock about those sands.

46
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,226
I haven't been home for years.

47
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,688
There you go. It will last you
for a while.

48
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,942
You'll get something else in Pedzhent,
but I can't give you any more, sorry.

49
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,739
I've made quite a detour as it is,
now I'm going straight ahead.

50
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,159
Once I get as far as the Volga,
Samara will be at a stone's throw.

51
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:16,581
I'll have no peace as long as Dzhavdet
is alive. Why have you dug me up?

52
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,751
Sure, a dead man doesn't have
to worry about anything,

53
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,420
but it's so boring.

54
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,606
What is it between you and that
Dzhavdet?

55
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,152
He killed my father...

56
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,988
...buried me,

57
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,491
took my four sheep,

58
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,354
that was all I had.

59
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,816
That... what's his name... Dzhavdet,

60
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,610
is he with Black Abdullah or what?

61
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,657
They hate each other.
Dzhavdet is a coward.

62
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,634
Abdullah is a warrior.

63
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:58,055
Well, Sayid...
Good luck!

64
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,153
Look, Commander.

65
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,745
In the old fortress, you should've
taken him through the chimney.

66
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,513
Through the chimney?

67
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:27,978
Sukhov, give us a hand. With you,
we'll finish him off in a jiffy.

68
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:33,817
You alone are worth a whole platoon,
if not a company.

69
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,197
East is a delicate matter.

70
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:48,232
How come you're here?
- They were shooting.

71
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,918
Look, at least take the women.

72
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:57,950
Imagine, I've been sitting three days
by the old fortress, with no sleep.

73
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,455
I waited for Abdullah to come back for
his harem. They tie me hand and foot!

74
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,457
Rakhimov!

75
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,711
I'm going home.
- Take them, and we'll get Abdullah.

76
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,922
He's at Dry Spring now.

77
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:15,426
You just take them as far as Pedzhent,
they will be safer there.

78
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,138
And I'll give you a man,
a horse, some cereal...

79
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,349
What do you say, Sukhov?

80
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,017
Sukhov...

81
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:28,038
Yes, I guess there're none of our men
as far as 300 versts from here now.

82
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,667
That's right.
- Then it's agreed.

83
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,905
Mount!

84
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,491
Comrade women!
Don't be afraid!

85
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,953
We'll finish off
your exploiting husband,

86
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,289
but as of now, you're under command
of Comrade Sukhov.

87
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,002
He will feed you and protect you...
he's a good man.

88
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,229
Hold it!

89
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,590
Wait!

90
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,858
Stop!

91
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,038
Damn it!

92
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:18,672
Am I going to wander about this
desert for the rest of my life?

93
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,554
Get up!

94
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,851
Don't go to Pedzhent.

95
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,839
Abdullah will come there.

96
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,482
We'll wait and see.

97
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,030
Give him the horse.

98
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,955
Here is the list, Comrade Sukhov.

99
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,252
Zarina,

100
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,964
Djamilya,

101
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,508
Giuzel,

102
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,262
Sayida,

103
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,473
Khafiza,

104
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,377
Zukhra,

105
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,603
Leyla,

106
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,174
Zulfia,

107
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,275
Gyulchatai.

108
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,237
Gyulchatai!

109
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,038
Right turn...

110
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,881
Follow me, young ladies.

111
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:53,125
My heart is longing for you,
my beloved Katerina Matveyevna,

112
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,211
like a crane is longing for the sky.

113
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,631
However, there's a hitch.

114
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,550
I think it will delay me for another
three days, no more.

115
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,930
Exactly, I was charged,
as a class-conscious soldier,

116
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,768
to accompany a group of comrades
from our brotherly East.

117
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:15,231
I must admit that
they happen to be agreeable folks,

118
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:20,251
I'd even say, warm ones, with zest.

119
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:26,492
So my feet are running now over
hot sands in the opposite direction,

120
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:33,181
as I am bound
by my revolutionary duty.

121
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:42,941
THIRD DAY

122
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:50,641
I would also like to inform you
that our deployment goes on smoothly,

123
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:55,896
in the atmosphere of fraternal unity
and harmony.

124
00:15:55,996 --> 00:16:00,083
We're just treading sands,
not sighing for anything,

125
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:07,131
except for you, my only and
unforgettable Katerina Matveyevna.

126
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,703
So don't you be grieving, either.

127
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,264
It does no good.

128
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:27,071
I beg you! Not in the museum!
We have most precious things here.

129
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,172
Wait.

130
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,743
Who are you?
- I'm the museum's curator.

131
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,664
My name is Lebedev.
- I see.

132
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,834
Where's the populace?
- Hiding. Bringing a harem in here!

133
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,212
Look here, Comrade Curator,

134
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:48,676
those nine liberated women of the
East are very precious things, too...

135
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,762
And let's not argue about it.
Any questions?

136
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,906
No questions.
Follow me!

137
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:27,146
All right,
you'll rest here for a day.

138
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,093
Djamilya,
Zarina, Giuzel,

139
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,221
Sayida, Khafiza, Zukhra,

140
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,683
Leyla, Zulfia, Gyulchatai.

141
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,351
Gyulchatai!

142
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,204
"MUSEUM OF THE RED EAST"

143
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,217
Good bye, young ladies!

144
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,391
Comrade Sukhov!

145
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,421
Maybe you'll stay for another day?
- Too much of a good thing.

146
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,756
Sukhov!
- Don't be scared!

147
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:13,734
Tomorrow Rakhimov will arrive,
he will take you on from here.

148
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,638
Sayid, good luck to you!

149
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,199
I'll just take a swim in the sea,
and off I go!

150
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:27,290
Don't let yourself be buried again.

151
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,758
Monsters!
Barbarians!

152
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,305
How are you?

153
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,983
Hands up!

154
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:33,400
To Red Army soldier Sukhov.

155
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,751
Personalized.

156
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:46,095
From Brigade Commander M.N. Kovun.

157
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:01,277
Abdullah had eleven wives. What have
you done to the other two?

158
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,432
You just wait, Abdullah will come
and tear your tongue out.

159
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:09,702
Why don't you say something?
- Saving my tongue.

160
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:15,942
Shall I finish you off right away
or you want to be tortured first?

161
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:19,211
I'd rather be tortured.

162
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:40,441
Semyon!
Ride to Abdullah!

163
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,044
Don't!
Come on, move!

164
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,795
How come you're here?

165
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:46,715
They were shooting.

166
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,824
Abdullah got a lot of men.

167
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,286
That's right.

168
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:25,671
I'm writing to you once again,
my dearest Katerina Matveyevna,

169
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,716
now that I've got a spare minute.

170
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,871
The warm sun is making me purr,

171
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:37,182
like our tomcat Vaska when he's
basking in it, perched on the hedge.

172
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:42,255
We're sitting now on the sand
by the very blue sea,

173
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,592
not disturbed by anything.

174
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:50,597
The sun is so bright here
that it makes you see white.

175
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,698
Comrade Sukhov!

176
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,870
What if Rakhimov is delayed?
What happens to us then?

177
00:24:58,162 --> 00:25:00,789
Abdullah will kill
us because of them.

178
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,219
Greetings, fathers!

179
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,840
DYNAMITE

180
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,692
We beg your pardon.

181
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,331
Where did you get it?

182
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:46,752
We've been sitting here for a long
time.

183
00:25:57,513 --> 00:25:59,473
Petrukha!

184
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,672
Take the box. We can use it.
- Right.

185
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:10,051
And tell the girls there will be no
Abdullah, you got it?

186
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,444
Got it!

187
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:46,004
What is it? - Go away!
Abdullah'll be here tomorrow.

188
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,507
But I can't go now. You see
how it turned out. Stay on, Sayid.

189
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,442
There's no Dzhavdet here.

190
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:55,404
Goodbye, then.

191
00:27:03,062 --> 00:27:05,339
"DORMITORY FOR LIBERATED
WOMEN OF THE EAST"

192
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:09,402
They took most valuable exhibits.
- What do you mean, exhibits?

193
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:14,589
I told them to take only worn rugs.
- But these are the 11th century!

194
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,316
As you were!

195
00:27:38,447 --> 00:27:41,533
Don't be afraid.
He's our master.

196
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,750
Master! No one must see
our faces. Only you.

197
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,254
You're our new husband.
Tell your man not to come here.

198
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:13,690
Comrade women!

199
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:16,928
The Revolution has made you free.

200
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,389
No one owns you anymore.
There's no master.

201
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:24,227
You can call me simply
Comrade Sukhov.

202
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,662
You may forget your
accursed past.

203
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,544
You will work freely now, and each
of you will have a separate husband.

204
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,422
Any questions?

205
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:42,218
No questions.

206
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:08,441
"DOWN WITH PREJUDICES!
WOMAN IS A HUMAN BEING, TOO"

207
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:28,515
Gyulchatai!

208
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:32,185
Show your face.

209
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,234
Don't think I'm just playing...
I may have serious intentions.

210
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:44,473
I don't mind you were someone's
wife. You're just right for me.

211
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:47,325
I like spirited girls.

212
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:52,414
I can even propose to you.

213
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:56,193
I've got a good, kind mother.
Everyone respects her.

214
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:59,879
Come on, show your face.
- As you were!

215
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,340
Hold it!

216
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,287
Gyulchatai!
- Yes, master.

217
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,206
Go announce a reveille to the girls.
Hold it!

218
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:11,667
As of today, I appoint you

219
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:15,046
to be in charge at the dormitory
here, responsible for the order.

220
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,965
Any questions?
- No.

221
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:22,193
The master has appointed me
his favorite wife.

222
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:26,974
Comrade Sukhov, I'm very serious,
I want to marry her.

223
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:30,269
I just want to see her face, what if
she looks like a crocodile.

224
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:34,690
Go to the shore. Find the white
house, a former czarist custom house.

225
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,625
Find out who's there now.

226
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,594
Freeze!
Hands up!

227
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,393
D'you know whose house you got in?

228
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:56,496
Answer me!
- I don't know.

229
00:31:56,622 --> 00:32:02,210
Have you never...
heard of Vereschagin?

230
00:32:03,128 --> 00:32:05,322
What have I come to!

231
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:10,327
In the old times,
everyone knew me here.

232
00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:13,179
I had them all in my hand.

233
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:17,558
Now they forgot.

234
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,349
Hold it!

235
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,854
Stop, I said!

236
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,487
Why did you kill my men, Sayid?

237
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:30,908
I sent them to tell you not to look
for Dzhavdet at Dry Spring.

238
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:34,453
He's not there.
Go back to Pedzhent.

239
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:37,873
Your father and my father were
friends.

240
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:42,059
When you happen to get a good
companion, the road comes easier.

241
00:34:01,997 --> 00:34:04,983
Your Honorable Excellence,

242
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:07,820
Lady Separation.

243
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,367
We've become like one with you,
Though with no intention.

244
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:19,430
Letter in the envelope,
Don't tear it, enough!

245
00:34:19,723 --> 00:34:24,644
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love...

246
00:34:24,853 --> 00:34:30,717
Letter in the envelope,
Don't tear it, enough!

247
00:34:30,817 --> 00:34:36,113
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love...

248
00:34:37,866 --> 00:34:41,645
Your Honorable Excellence,

249
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:44,982
Dear Lady Luck.

250
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:47,943
Some you grace with fortune,

251
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:52,046
Others you would duck.

252
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:59,220
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!

253
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:05,393
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.

254
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:12,988
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!

255
00:35:14,736 --> 00:35:21,534
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.

256
00:35:50,272 --> 00:35:54,358
Hey, good man!
Have you got a light?

257
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:04,618
Where are you going?
- That's Comrade Sukhov.

258
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:11,917
So you say it's Sukhov?

259
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:17,131
Let's check out
that Sukhov.

260
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:33,006
Oh God, forgive me my sins...

261
00:36:33,106 --> 00:36:35,316
Catch it!

262
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:01,926
Well, come on in!

263
00:37:10,644 --> 00:37:14,756
Have you seen the peacocks
in the yard? - I have.

264
00:37:14,856 --> 00:37:19,177
I traded them in... for my uniform.

265
00:37:19,277 --> 00:37:21,695
Petrukha!

266
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:24,949
I don't drink.

267
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,352
Good for you.

268
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:31,731
I'm going to finish this
and give up, too.

269
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:33,707
Drink up!

270
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:42,383
Sit down!

271
00:37:46,346 --> 00:37:50,599
I like your Petrukha very much.

272
00:37:51,643 --> 00:37:54,395
Can you give me a machine-gun?

273
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:06,740
Are you waiting for Abdullah?
- Yes.

274
00:38:11,413 --> 00:38:13,565
Look, Sukhov,

275
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:19,211
when I had a custom house here,
there were the smugglers.

276
00:38:19,337 --> 00:38:22,657
There's no custom house now,
there're no smugglers.

277
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:25,952
In short, I made peace with Abdullah.

278
00:38:26,052 --> 00:38:29,539
Whites or Reds,
they make no difference to me.

279
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:32,766
Whether it's Abdullah,
or it's you.

280
00:38:36,104 --> 00:38:40,399
If I went with you,
that would be different.

281
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:43,360
What's the problem, then?

282
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:47,740
Let's go.

283
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:51,910
Let's go.

284
00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:04,298
Let's go.

285
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,885
Hello.

286
00:39:10,513 --> 00:39:12,931
Hello.

287
00:39:18,229 --> 00:39:20,689
Guys!

288
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:26,069
Come back!

289
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:30,240
What did you tell me?

290
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,731
What solemn promises you gave me?
Have you gone crazy at your age?

291
00:39:36,831 --> 00:39:37,982
Nastasya...

292
00:39:38,082 --> 00:39:40,902
You'd ruined the best years of my
life,

293
00:39:41,002 --> 00:39:44,755
and now you want to make me
a widow?

294
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:52,997
Pasha!

295
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:56,141
Pasha dear!
Pasha!

296
00:39:56,392 --> 00:39:59,379
Forgive me, for Christ's sake!

297
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:02,799
Don't go!
Don't go with them!

298
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:06,735
They'll get you killed
just for nothing!

299
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,914
Well, guys...

300
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:22,251
I can't give you the machine-gun.

301
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:25,921
We understand.

302
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:44,606
So, it's the peacocks, right?

303
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:11,591
Who told you to come here?

304
00:41:37,326 --> 00:41:41,413
Have you measured it?
- Exactly three and a half meters!

305
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:48,571
Will it catch fire?
- It should.

306
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:51,715
As soon as it does, start counting.

307
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:18,950
Forty two!

308
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:27,709
They can go in the motor boat now.

309
00:42:31,088 --> 00:42:33,408
They want to get behind the border.

310
00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:37,803
After they start the motor,
42 seconds and... boom!

311
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:41,223
That's right.

312
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:44,893
Clean up here.

313
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:04,272
The geese...

314
00:43:04,372 --> 00:43:08,943
They may have come from our parts,
or just flown over there.

315
00:43:09,043 --> 00:43:12,321
Where are you from?
- A village near Kursk.

316
00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:17,717
Never been there. I left home
when I was a kid like you...

317
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:21,581
I've been knocked around the whole
world...

318
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:24,500
From the Amur river...
- The Amur river?

319
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,227
...to Turkestan.

320
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:36,429
Before he died, my father said:

321
00:43:36,529 --> 00:43:40,600
"Abdullah, all my life I was poor,

322
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,936
and I wish that God send you
an expensive robe

323
00:43:44,036 --> 00:43:47,414
and a beautiful harness for your
horse."

324
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,152
I waited for a long time,
then God said:

325
00:43:51,252 --> 00:43:54,405
"Mount your horse and take everything
you want yourself,

326
00:43:54,505 --> 00:43:57,825
if you're a brave and strong man."

327
00:43:57,925 --> 00:44:02,429
My father didn't say anything.
Dzhavdet killed him in the back.

328
00:44:03,764 --> 00:44:05,958
Your father was a wise man,

329
00:44:06,058 --> 00:44:09,378
but who on this earth knows
what is good and what is bad?

330
00:44:09,478 --> 00:44:13,023
The dagger's good for the one
who has it,

331
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,071
and bad for the one who hasn't it...
at the right time.

332
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:15,069
Oh, Allah, where's he, that husband
of ours?

333
00:45:15,169 --> 00:45:17,712
It's all her fault,

334
00:45:18,714 --> 00:45:20,757
Gyulchatai's!

335
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:25,162
When I was Abdullah's favorite wife,
you saw him every day.

336
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:27,581
And he beat us every day.

337
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:32,253
Our husband forgot about us before
he knew us. -Why, we're not that bad.

338
00:45:32,353 --> 00:45:36,882
Maybe, Gyulchatai doesn't
caress him well enough?

339
00:45:36,982 --> 00:45:41,069
Or he doesn't like the way
she dresses? -Or perhaps...

340
00:46:00,005 --> 00:46:02,215
What's the matter?

341
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:08,847
How old are you?

342
00:46:13,811 --> 00:46:15,880
Don't even think of that.

343
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:21,177
Or maybe we'd really get you married?
To Petrukha, in lawful wedlock.

344
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:25,572
The boy is not married,
he wants to take you to his mother.

345
00:46:26,282 --> 00:46:29,685
I'm your wife.
- My wife is at home.

346
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:33,189
Can't you tell her that
Gyulchatai's your favorite wife?

347
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:35,957
She won't be offended, will she?

348
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:38,903
She will!

349
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:42,656
How many times must I explain it?
We're supposed to have only one wife.

350
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:45,717
Do you understand?
One!

351
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:52,583
Wouldn't you like your husband to love,
give presents to and caress only you?

352
00:46:52,683 --> 00:46:56,144
You think it's bad?
- It's good.

353
00:46:58,606 --> 00:47:00,925
One wife loves,

354
00:47:01,025 --> 00:47:05,638
one makes clothes,
one cooks,

355
00:47:05,738 --> 00:47:08,740
one feeds the children...

356
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:15,481
One wife doing all this?
- Nothing can be done about that.

357
00:47:15,581 --> 00:47:19,167
It's hard.
- Sure it's hard.

358
00:47:22,546 --> 00:47:26,883
All right, good night now.
We'll talk tomorrow.

359
00:49:07,568 --> 00:49:11,320
Ibragim!
That's lbragim's robe!

360
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:15,032
Poor lbragim!

361
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:26,460
Until I catch them,
you'll stay with us.

362
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:45,771
I would also like to tell you,
Katerina Matveyevna,

363
00:49:46,648 --> 00:49:50,928
that sometimes I get so sick
at my heart,

364
00:49:51,028 --> 00:49:53,847
such sadness grips me with its claws,

365
00:49:53,947 --> 00:49:58,185
when I'm wondering how you're
doing over there.

366
00:49:58,285 --> 00:50:00,687
What troubles you?

367
00:50:00,787 --> 00:50:04,274
Have you coped with
hay making or not?

368
00:50:04,374 --> 00:50:08,210
The grass must have been abundant
this year...

369
00:50:08,712 --> 00:50:11,532
Well, our separation won't last
long now.

370
00:50:11,632 --> 00:50:14,701
I'll give a bit of help
to this group of comrades,

371
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:17,788
settle some other problems,

372
00:50:17,888 --> 00:50:22,808
and make my way in your direction,
my invaluable Katerina Matveyevna.

373
00:50:23,685 --> 00:50:28,522
Now I beg your pardon, there is
a small hitch. I'll finish next time.

374
00:50:35,656 --> 00:50:38,324
Come out, if you're there!

375
00:50:40,077 --> 00:50:42,870
We've been loyal to you, master!

376
00:50:44,206 --> 00:50:46,149
Djamilya...

377
00:50:46,249 --> 00:50:52,698
You've been my favorite wife, haven't
you? Have I ever hurt you?

378
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:55,883
Why aren't you dead?

379
00:51:20,283 --> 00:51:22,519
Drop the gun...

380
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,563
If you turn back, I'll shoot.

381
00:51:24,663 --> 00:51:26,747
Drop it!

382
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:30,626
Hands up!

383
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:40,928
Your dagger.

384
00:51:47,185 --> 00:51:50,187
Make five steps forward.

385
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:18,492
And tell your hirelings to get out
of the yard.

386
00:52:18,592 --> 00:52:23,095
I'll let you free as soon as your men
leave Pedzhent.

387
00:52:34,524 --> 00:52:37,568
I never miss.

388
00:52:43,575 --> 00:52:48,871
Abdullah, you may
put your hands down.

389
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:53,667
Makhmud!

390
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,155
Gallop to the shore, all of you!

391
00:52:57,255 --> 00:53:01,243
Load the boat and
put it on the water.

392
00:53:01,343 --> 00:53:04,371
I'm staying here... as a guest.

393
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:07,707
But if I'm not there by noon,
come back to settle a score...

394
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:11,685
...for the hospitality.
Get out!

395
00:53:23,073 --> 00:53:25,449
Petrukha!

396
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:30,162
You stay here.

397
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:35,584
I'm going to the shore.
To see what the bandits are doing.

398
00:53:39,714 --> 00:53:42,675
They stole Abdullah!

399
00:54:04,364 --> 00:54:07,324
Don't tell anyone...

400
00:54:08,326 --> 00:54:10,869
You better not.

401
00:54:45,113 --> 00:54:47,739
They'll cheat you.

402
00:54:48,116 --> 00:54:50,769
They'll board the boat.

403
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:55,289
You'll let Abdullah free,
and they'll be back.

404
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,793
I don't think so.

405
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:06,034
Caviar again!

406
00:55:06,134 --> 00:55:10,345
I'm fed up with eating the damn
thing every day!

407
00:55:10,513 --> 00:55:13,682
Couldn't you get some bread?

408
00:55:13,975 --> 00:55:16,669
How can I get it now?

409
00:55:16,769 --> 00:55:20,272
Eat it! You got to eat something
after drinking.

410
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:40,125
Everyone in the
village is dead scared.

411
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:44,322
People don't even poke their noses
out of doors.

412
00:55:44,422 --> 00:55:48,243
The Revolutionary Committee's
Commissioner and the militia man

413
00:55:48,343 --> 00:55:50,370
have not returned from the city yet.

414
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:53,289
And that red-haired one who was here

415
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:56,808
is said to have gotten Abdullah
himself.

416
00:55:59,395 --> 00:56:01,897
I don't like all this.

417
00:56:03,775 --> 00:56:05,885
Oh, God!

418
00:56:05,985 --> 00:56:09,305
Don't you get into this,
don't butt in!

419
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:12,950
You have done your share
of fighting.

420
00:56:29,008 --> 00:56:31,551
Gyulchatai!

421
00:56:39,227 --> 00:56:41,979
Show your face.

422
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:45,190
Come on, show it.

423
00:56:47,777 --> 00:56:50,779
Is someone sneaking around?

424
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,039
Gyulchatai.

425
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,627
Gyulchatai!

426
00:57:08,131 --> 00:57:11,258
Bring some water.

427
00:57:32,238 --> 00:57:34,098
Hands up!

428
00:57:34,198 --> 00:57:37,352
Oh, it's you?
What are you doing there?

429
00:57:37,452 --> 00:57:39,437
Please, don't say a word to anyone.

430
00:57:39,537 --> 00:57:42,539
We have a hiding place here.

431
00:58:22,747 --> 00:58:25,373
Show your face.

432
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,062
Petrukha!

433
00:59:56,465 --> 00:59:59,493
Go away now. Hurry.

434
00:59:59,593 --> 01:00:02,330
You can't stay here alone.

435
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:04,290
I can't leave either.

436
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:08,377
Abdullah will kill the women.
- Abdullah will kill you.

437
01:00:08,477 --> 01:00:11,020
They're his wives.

438
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,970
Goodbye.
- I counted on you.

439
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:24,242
If I'm killed, who's going
to take vengeance on Dzhavdet?

440
01:00:25,703 --> 01:00:29,038
I counted on you, Sayid.

441
01:01:03,741 --> 01:01:06,435
And if Fate wills for us
not to see each other again,

442
01:01:06,535 --> 01:01:10,314
Katerina Matveyevna, you should know

443
01:01:10,414 --> 01:01:13,526
that I have been and will be,
to my last breath,

444
01:01:13,626 --> 01:01:16,862
devoted only to you alone.

445
01:01:16,962 --> 01:01:20,991
And since it may happen that
I'm buried forever in these sands,

446
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:25,178
this unaccustomed thought
even making me feel sad...

447
01:01:26,305 --> 01:01:30,835
Or maybe it's because I've met lately

448
01:01:30,935 --> 01:01:36,439
mostly very warm people,
I'd even say, delicate people.

449
01:01:38,526 --> 01:01:41,429
Bearing witness to this is...

450
01:01:41,529 --> 01:01:45,641
fighter for the happiness of working
people of the whole world,

451
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:50,646
member of the Caspian International
Revolutionary Proletarian Regiment

452
01:01:50,746 --> 01:01:53,357
named after Comrade August Bebel,

453
01:01:53,457 --> 01:01:55,959
Red Army man...

454
01:01:56,377 --> 01:02:00,088
Fyodor lvanovich Sukhov.

455
01:02:08,055 --> 01:02:10,958
Have the women left, curator?

456
01:02:11,058 --> 01:02:15,979
I detained them.
Look, this is an underground passage.

457
01:02:17,231 --> 01:02:21,302
It leads to the seashore. It was dug
at the time of the Samanid Dynasty.

458
01:02:21,402 --> 01:02:25,488
No one has used it
in the last 400 years.

459
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,716
They're not here!

460
01:02:46,135 --> 01:02:48,913
They couldn't have gone far.

461
01:02:49,013 --> 01:02:52,791
Let go of my hand.
Let go, I said.

462
01:02:52,891 --> 01:02:56,978
Why this violence?
- Let him go, Akhmed.

463
01:02:57,688 --> 01:03:00,591
Stop this plunder now!

464
01:03:00,691 --> 01:03:04,986
There're no women here.
And I don't know anything about...

465
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,823
There must be an underground passage
here...

466
01:03:31,013 --> 01:03:33,056
Get down!

467
01:03:35,893 --> 01:03:38,186
Cling to the ground!

468
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:11,636
Follow me!

469
01:04:39,748 --> 01:04:42,250
There's no one here!

470
01:04:45,796 --> 01:04:48,297
They couldn't bury them in the sand.

471
01:04:52,052 --> 01:04:54,428
No one here either.

472
01:05:19,913 --> 01:05:22,649
We can't open it up.

473
01:05:22,749 --> 01:05:27,044
We could blow it up.
- We don't have any grenades.

474
01:05:31,717 --> 01:05:34,328
Leave at least one bullet, Abdullah,

475
01:05:34,428 --> 01:05:37,763
to shoot ourselves with.

476
01:05:39,683 --> 01:05:44,645
Your Honorable Excellence,

477
01:05:45,147 --> 01:05:51,485
Lady Foreign Land.

478
01:05:52,988 --> 01:05:57,267
Your embrace is very hot,

479
01:05:57,367 --> 01:06:02,079
But to love you can't.

480
01:06:03,248 --> 01:06:08,111
In your seductive mire

481
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:12,506
Don't call me, enough.

482
01:06:12,758 --> 01:06:16,969
No luck in dying,

483
01:06:17,179 --> 01:06:21,833
There'll be luck in love...

484
01:06:21,933 --> 01:06:26,771
Your Honorable Excellence,

485
01:06:27,397 --> 01:06:33,027
Dear Lady Victory.

486
01:06:34,613 --> 01:06:39,700
It seems my song is over...

487
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:42,870
Still singing?

488
01:06:48,502 --> 01:06:52,489
I came from Abdullah.
We've run out of grenades,

489
01:06:52,589 --> 01:06:55,508
and you've got a whole supply.

490
01:06:57,636 --> 01:07:00,622
Stop it!

491
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:04,517
There'll be luck in love!

492
01:07:07,854 --> 01:07:13,692
And stand up when a lieutenant
is talking to you.

493
01:07:27,415 --> 01:07:31,111
Devils, stop your crying

494
01:07:31,211 --> 01:07:35,047
And swearing on blood!

495
01:07:37,843 --> 01:07:40,412
No luck in dying...

496
01:07:40,512 --> 01:07:43,722
He's got wrong grenades.

497
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:50,813
It's full.

498
01:07:52,649 --> 01:07:54,468
Abdullah!

499
01:07:54,568 --> 01:08:00,072
Are you still wearing a yashmak, or
you've changed into men's clothes?

500
01:08:00,407 --> 01:08:04,519
Abdullah, your wives are very tender.

501
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:08,440
I'm enjoying them.
- I'm giving them to you.

502
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:12,418
When I set oil on fire,
you'll enjoy it even better.

503
01:08:13,211 --> 01:08:15,212
You'll enjoy it very much.

504
01:08:17,632 --> 01:08:22,454
They give us no peace.
One feels like running away.

505
01:08:22,554 --> 01:08:26,750
Some want grenades...
Others want bullets...

506
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:30,311
May the devil take them!

507
01:08:33,106 --> 01:08:37,276
Come on, move!
Hurry up!

508
01:08:38,403 --> 01:08:43,699
Are you asleep, you bastard?
Shall I wake you up with a lash?

509
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:12,936
I haven't seen you
for ages, Abdullah.

510
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:16,398
Yes, it's been a long time.

511
01:09:16,983 --> 01:09:21,403
Still leading a nomad's life?
Still shooting?

512
01:09:21,696 --> 01:09:27,102
I got old and lazy.
Remember what I was like?

513
01:09:27,202 --> 01:09:29,521
Those were the times.

514
01:09:29,621 --> 01:09:33,165
What are your men up to?

515
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:36,502
What do they want to blow up?

516
01:09:37,879 --> 01:09:41,757
Some character got in there,
and won't come out.

517
01:09:46,638 --> 01:09:50,250
Fyodor!
Is Petrukha with you?

518
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:54,004
They killed Petrukha,
Pavel Artemyich!

519
01:09:54,104 --> 01:09:56,772
Abdullah stabbed him to death.

520
01:10:02,153 --> 01:10:04,780
Pasha!

521
01:10:12,205 --> 01:10:14,248
Come on, go!

522
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:20,045
A good wife and a good home, what
else does a man need at his old age?

523
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:41,843
I may have spent a fortune, but I got
some flour.

524
01:10:41,943 --> 01:10:45,305
I'm going to cook borscht
and make pancakes.

525
01:10:45,405 --> 01:10:48,433
At least it's some bread.

526
01:10:48,533 --> 01:10:52,187
We've overstayed our time here.
As soon as the commissioner's back,

527
01:10:52,287 --> 01:10:55,190
we'll go to Astrakhan.

528
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:59,152
It's time to tend to our son's grave.
It must've overgrown with weeds...

529
01:10:59,252 --> 01:11:03,364
And we haven't been to church over
a year now. It's a great sin.

530
01:11:03,464 --> 01:11:06,367
You'll wear your embroidered shirt.

531
01:11:06,467 --> 01:11:11,372
When I see you in that shirt,
I remember everything...

532
01:11:11,472 --> 01:11:14,182
How we met in the infirmary
in Tsaritsyn...

533
01:11:16,352 --> 01:11:18,770
Pasha...

534
01:11:19,063 --> 01:11:22,524
Do you remember the "Prince of
Tauride steamship?

535
01:11:25,653 --> 01:11:28,739
And what a dressing down you gave
to that staff-captain

536
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:33,285
at the fair in Kazan?

537
01:12:10,448 --> 01:12:12,976
Hey, Abdullah!

538
01:12:13,076 --> 01:12:15,478
Haven't you got too much goods?

539
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:18,606
And all of it duty free?

540
01:12:18,706 --> 01:12:23,611
But there's no one at the customs.
Who should I pay duty to?

541
01:12:23,711 --> 01:12:28,256
We could pay you in gold.

542
01:12:29,008 --> 01:12:34,455
You know me well, Abdullah...
I never take bribes.

543
01:12:34,555 --> 01:12:37,125
It pains me to see
the state suffering.

544
01:12:37,225 --> 01:12:40,685
Aristarkh!
Settle it with the customs man.

545
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:07,212
Fire it up!

546
01:13:12,135 --> 01:13:15,413
Wait, Abdullah!

547
01:13:15,513 --> 01:13:19,641
It's me, Sayid, speaking!

548
01:13:22,436 --> 01:13:25,438
What do you mean by that?

549
01:13:39,245 --> 01:13:41,997
Kill him!

550
01:14:16,657 --> 01:14:20,702
Vereschagin!
Leave the boat!

551
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,625
Give it back!

552
01:14:42,558 --> 01:14:45,352
Wash up, guys!

553
01:15:32,858 --> 01:15:36,236
He did go! He did go after all!

554
01:15:40,533 --> 01:15:43,451
Damn him!

555
01:16:07,726 --> 01:16:09,727
Pasha!

556
01:16:16,068 --> 01:16:18,278
Pasha!

557
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:27,745
Well, have you come to your senses?

558
01:16:34,128 --> 01:16:38,923
Abdullah!
The customs man has cleared it!

559
01:16:49,351 --> 01:16:50,503
Makhmud!

560
01:16:50,603 --> 01:16:52,812
Fire it up!

561
01:17:31,685 --> 01:17:36,022
Get to him from the back, Makhmud!

562
01:17:51,872 --> 01:17:54,832
Don't let him stick his nose out.

563
01:18:13,268 --> 01:18:16,229
Don't start the motor!

564
01:18:18,315 --> 01:18:21,135
I'm going to get closer.

565
01:18:21,235 --> 01:18:24,487
You'll get blown up!
Stop!

566
01:19:17,749 --> 01:19:20,626
I'm here, Abdullah.

567
01:19:57,206 --> 01:20:00,249
You can come out, young ladies.

568
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:22,256
Your Honorable Excellence,
Dear Lady Luck.

569
01:20:22,356 --> 01:20:27,526
Some you grace with fortune,
Others you would duck.

570
01:20:27,694 --> 01:20:32,599
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!

571
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:37,563
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.

572
01:20:37,663 --> 01:20:43,042
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!

573
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:48,422
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.

574
01:21:20,872 --> 01:21:24,989
THE SUN WAS NOT UP YET

575
01:21:28,714 --> 01:21:31,825
You'd better wait, will you?
We'll get to the city together,

576
01:21:31,925 --> 01:21:34,911
and take the train from there.

577
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:39,750
No. That's a big detour.
I'll go straight and be there sooner.

578
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:43,144
Take a horse.
- No.

579
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:45,672
A horse will be a nuisance.
You have to feed it.

580
01:21:45,772 --> 01:21:48,107
Goodbye.

581
01:21:50,569 --> 01:21:55,057
Well? Djamilya, Zarina, Giuzel,

582
01:21:55,157 --> 01:21:58,393
Sayida, Khafiza, Zukhra,

583
01:21:58,493 --> 01:22:01,537
Leyla, Zulfia.

584
01:22:05,208 --> 01:22:07,793
Goodbye, young ladies.

585
01:22:08,503 --> 01:22:11,338
Sorry if I did something wrong.

586
01:22:21,016 --> 01:22:23,225
Thank you!

587
01:22:23,935 --> 01:22:26,103
Don't mention it.

588
01:22:36,948 --> 01:22:41,035
What about Dzhavdet?
Do you need some help?

589
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:47,875
No, I'll deal with Dzhavdet myself.
Should you meet him, don't touch him.

590
01:22:48,418 --> 01:22:53,005
Well, good luck, then.

591
01:23:08,188 --> 01:23:11,800
A good day,
a pleasant moment.

592
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:16,054
How are you doing, my precious
Katerina Matveyevna?

593
01:23:16,154 --> 01:23:21,143
Don't judge me too harshly for
the delay. It seems to be my fate.

594
01:23:21,243 --> 01:23:24,729
But I think nothing like that
is going to happen again.

595
01:23:24,829 --> 01:23:31,168
So I hasten to inform you that I'm
alive and well, and hope you're, too.
