00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:20,829
We've found it!

36
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,827
It's empty!

37
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,733
All agents! Stand by!

38
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,842
Why's he smiling?

39
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,440
Got him!

00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,754

Message erased.

51
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:45,916
Shit!

52
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,123
You don't know
shit about love!

53
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,916
Damn lies all the time!

54
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,529

You! In the wedding dress!
Stop right there!

61
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,944

3 Years later

77
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,359
So how'd it go?

78
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,860
Industrial Security Team, NlS
Did you sleep with him?

79
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,055
Crazy?
I just met the guy!

80
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:57,066
The only way a man and a woman
can connect is through sex!

81
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,365
Please!

82
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:02,369
Hey! It's rude to be picKY
about men at your age.

83
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,769
As long as he's not
the eldest son!

84
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,572
I'm the eldest son.

85
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,083
My father passed away.
And I have two sisters.

86
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,082
It couldn't be worse!

87
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,186
A widowed mother
with two sisters!

88
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,082
Break up!

89
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:23,792
Excuse me.

90
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,390
Yes.

91
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,193
Ms. Ahn Soo-ji?
Please return the DVD you rented.

92
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:34,100
Don't you feel guilty...

93
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,604
Hello?

94
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:36,707
Who's calling, please?

95
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,312
Stop wasting your time!
Break up with him!

96
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,106
Yes, thank you.

97
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:48,320
I'm sorry.
I'm always on call.

98
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,118
I had no idea
travel agents were so busy.

99
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,922
So, are your sisters nice
Sung-joon?

100
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,327
Of course, they married early
and immigrated to the States.

101
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:05,835
Bravo! Nice!
All sister-in-laws should emigrate!

102
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,933
Isn't his mother
moving away, too?

103
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,138
Mom gave me the headache of
running one of our companies

104
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,136
but she's great.

105
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:18,044
Oh my god, if they're rich
the eldest son's the best!

106
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,649
Don't lose this man!

107
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,657
How long do I have to pretend
being a travel agent?

108
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,660
- Should I just tell him?
- Stick to regulations.

109
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,661
And lie all my life?

110
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,357
It's not lying
It's just hiding your identity.

111
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,867
Name, Roh Hyung-KYu
Age, 46.

112
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,163
Top researcher

113
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:43,069
for the federal project to
develop the antivirus for Al.

114
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,472
3 weeks ago
he secretly took

115
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,680
some of the frozen vaccine.

116
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,783
But the leaked vaccine was
modified B-type No. 9.

117
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,483
When exposed
at room temperature

118
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,384
it turns into a mutative virus.

119
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,786
Within 6 minutes it
will genetically

120
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,292
modify all living beings
in the country.

121
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,692
You call that a report!

122
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:09,096
It's not just a leak
in national assets!

123
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,101
It's exporting
a biochemical weapon!

124
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,499
We could be
aiding terrorists!

125
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,707
Check every delivery
sent out!

126
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,711
Find out everything on his family
finances, and who he meets!

127
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,804
Even what toothpaste
he uses!

128
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:49,134
We set up CCTV's and wiretap
devices in Dr. Roh's room.

129
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,333
From hacking his last email

130
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,343
we learned that he's meeting
his first contact at NS Hotel.

131
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:01,250
FN-DCS2873. It's a biochemical
tracking device.

132
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,854
Insert this
and we can track him 24-7

133
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,555
Really?

134
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,053
That's right.
Do you know how to use it?

135
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,353
I've never seen this before.

136
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,765
Let's see...

137
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,460
Okay, then...

138
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,566
Just stick it in the ass!

139
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,784
Excuse me.
Can I get you something, sir?

140
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,080
- Coffee.
- Yes, sir.

141
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,496
He drank it.
Get ready for him.

142
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,271
Tracking device initiated.
Everyone pull out.

143
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:06,571
Watch where you squirt!

144
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,681
Can't you aim it right?

145
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,305
You bastard!

146
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:42,213
How could you leave me!

147
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,319
You don't call once
in three years!

148
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,420
How can you
do that to me!

149
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,319
I'll kill you!

150
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,924
I told you to stop.

151
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,432
Quiet!

152
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,430
Name, please!

153
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,738
- When did you come back?
- Today.

154
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,736
- Where were you?
- Canada.

155
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,739
- What did you do?
- Study international accounting.

156
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:13,944
So you're an accountant?

157
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,039
State your name, please!

158
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,047
- Why didn't you call?
- Quit the travel agency?

159
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:19,547
Why'd you go?

160
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,448
Why are you a cleaning lady?

161
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,248
- Why'd you go?
- Like you don't know!

162
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,051
Tell me your names!

163
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,056
- Mister!
- Quiet!

164
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,159
You really don't know why I left?

165
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,667
3 years ago

166
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:46,368
Point 7! Head east!

167
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,479
I'm busy, now.

168
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,084
I have to fill in for
someone at work.

169
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:59,090
No! Don't come!
I'm in Jeju lsland...

170
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:11,995
Thank you.

171
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,603
Have a good day.

172
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:26,017
The phone has been turned off
Please leave a message...

173
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,416
Then what happened?

174
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,217
What would you have done?

175
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,216
I would've broken it off!

176
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,224
Lying all the time like that!

177
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,091
- I did!
- Good!

178
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,027
I bet she was cheating on you.

179
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,328
I was not!

180
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,629
Can't you say the truth for once!

181
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,140
Hi, Sung-joon.

182
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,742
Sorry. Something came up.

183
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,645
Here?

184
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,056
Well, I'm...

185
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,650
Say Jeju lsland
why don't you!

186
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,762
I'm at a police station.

187
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,660
Problems came up with a client.

188
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,769
Who's the guy?

189
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,269
None of your business
We're through.

190
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,470
That wasn't my fault
Still don't know why I left?

191
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,080
- I don't wanna know!
- Why!

192
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,379
Cuz you're the one
that left me!

193
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,489
Call me!
I'll help you get a better job.

194
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:44,894
I got connections.

195
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,494
I'm not an average
accountant.

196
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,300
Screw you! I'm not
an average cleaning lady.

197
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,414
Don't let me see you again
even if by accident.

198
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,711
Or I might kill you.

199
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,231
He's back?
After 3 years?

200
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,423
That's right!

201
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,333
And he didn't even think
of apologizing!

202
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,832
Don't be fooled by men
who apologize.

203
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:34,645
When they're really sorry
they can't say it.

204
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,845
Still! I'm not forgiving him!

205
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:42,548
An international accountant?
Isn't that better than Sung-joon?

206
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,550
- How about starting over?
- Forget it!

207
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,153
I'm marrying Sung-joon!

208
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,383
Patriot Dairies

209
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:41,205
Overseas operations
NlS Harimao Team

210
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,610
He's practically a kid.

211
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,213
What do I do with a guy
who used to file papers.

212
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,222
He worked on profiles
in Russia.

213
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,620
Train him to be a Harimao.

214
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,617
Not everyone can
become a Harimao.

215
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,230
Who said you can sit?

216
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,234
Who said you can stand?

217
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,933
Why'd you get dragged to
the police? That's humiliating.

218
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,838
Something unexpected
came up on the job, sir.

219
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,241
You should've expected
the unexpected!

220
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,440
- Sorry, sir.
- Enough.

221
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,046
Go easy.
Let's hear the report.

222
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,551
Yes, sir.

223
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:23,845
Well, well...

224
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,552
Who said
you can open that?

225
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,552
Who said
you can close that?

226
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,062
Think this is some joke?

227
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,063
Enough.

228
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,367
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

229
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,682
Not in the eye, idiot!

230
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,288
Sorry, the password...

231
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,497
He's really
something alright.

232
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,411
Victor Bovchav.

233
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,919
A former KGB.

234
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,718
A top secret agent
for FSB's 'Vympel'

235
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,125
Vympel's intelligence
is top of the line.

236
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,423
North Korea's nuclear weapons
info came from here, first.

237
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,330
He probably came to
assassinate a key figure.

238
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:49,340
With my expert skills...

239
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,139
I trailed Victor's every
move 24- 7 in Russia.

240
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,344
- Next!
- Yes, sir.

241
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,543
He is already on the ClA's black list
for assassinating many key figures.

242
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,645
He arrived 32 hours ago and is
staying at Rm. 909 at NS Hotel.

243
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,355
What's that?

244
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:09,757
Whose phone's
on during a meeting?

245
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:15,763
Sorry, sir.

246
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,362
Hello?

247
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,166
Hello?

248
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:21,469
Mom...

249
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,572
What's my baby boy doing?

250
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,071
I'm in a meeting.

251
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,766
Really?
I love you, son!

252
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:26,774
Love you too, Mom.

253
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,674
Who's big boy are you?

254
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,677
Mama's big boy!

255
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,076
I apologize.

256
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,194
Where was l?

257
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,397
Love you, too
Mama's big boy!

258
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,392
- Thank you. As I was saying...
- Enough!

259
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,403
A former Russian spy probably
didn't come for sightseeing.

260
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:55,899
Boot him out
before he does anything.

261
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,702
That won't be easy, sir.

262
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:02,405
He came in as a rep for a large
Russian trading company.

263
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,610
They think they can play us?

264
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,511
- Chief Kim.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,421
I'll back you 1 00%
You handle it.

266
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,618
- Take care, sir.
- Take care, sir.

267
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,229
- But I think...
- Who said you can think!

268
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,430
Agent Lee
get a job at the hotel.

269
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,124
Yes, sir.

270
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,632
And you open up
an office next door.

271
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:25,235
Yes, sir.

272
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:26,736
And you!

273
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,738
Go home.

274
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,132
Get rid of
the password, too!

275
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,639
But Chief!
I'll be on the frontline and...

276
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,538
Chief!

277
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,644
I guarantee
it's 100%. real.

278
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,652
No credit cards.
I only take cash.

279
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,550
No, I can't take credit cards.
Evening...

280
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,452
You son of a bitch!

281
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,432
Oh, not you, sir
Hold on.

282
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,067
Hold on a sec, buddy.

283
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,259
Sorry, sir.

284
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:02,070
I'll meet you
at that place, before.

285
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,872
It's the real deal!
From the States!

286
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,068
No fake stuff
whatsoever!

287
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,677
Honey!
Someone's here!

288
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:10,872
Someone's here!

289
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,577
Hey, buddy!

290
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,479
You don't call for 3 years
I thought you were dead!

291
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:20,184
Are you back for good?

292
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:20,824
Yes.

293
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,792
I gotta go on a delivery
Watch the store for me.

294
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,086
But Se-KYun!

295
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:29,097
This is the late-returns list.

296
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,495
Call and tell them

297
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,901
to return the videos
soon, okay?

298
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,595
- Sorry! I'll be back soon!
- Hey! Wait!

299
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,503
Cool suit, man!

300
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,701
Looks expensive!

301
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,607
Let me try it on, man.

302
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,615
Come on.
Let me try it, buddy.

303
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,613
Pretty cool!

304
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:51,517
Be right back.

305
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,114
Hey! Se-KYun!

306
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,135
- Do you come here often?
- No.

307
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:19,350
I waited till I found a girlfriend
to come to a nice place like this.

308
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,665
This is Yangji Videos.

309
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,862
Could you bring in
the overdue DVD?

310
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:40,762
This is Yangji Videos.

311
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,170
If you don't bring it in today
I'll come to your house.

312
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,675
If you don't bring the 50 cents
I'll tell your mom!

313
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,077
Bring it now!

314
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,683
Thinks he can write off
50 cents!

315
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:58,888
Soo-ji?

316
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,788
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

317
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,697
Hello?

318
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,802
Ms. Ahn Soo-ji?

319
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:14,601
Yes.

320
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,904
The one who used to
be a travel agent?

321
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,912
Yes, but...
Who's calling please?

322
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,107
It is you! I knew it was you!

323
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,314
Is this...
Jae-joon?

324
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:31,717
Speak in Korean!

325
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,222
Why are you there?

326
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,228
This store's one of my clients.
Return the late DVD!

327
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,626
You took out a new release
for months!

328
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,632
Whatever! What I do is none
of your business!

329
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,636
Think I can't speak Japanese?

330
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,240
Bring in the DVD right now!
I'll wait all night, till you do!

331
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,136
Whatever! You moron!

332
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,640
Moron? Hey!

333
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,638
I'm sorry...

334
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,152
It's a really rude client
He came in yesterday.

335
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,151
Shouldn't you get back
to the office?

336
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,653
It's nothing! Really!

337
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:09,657
Let's eat.

338
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,359
Please eat.

339
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,672
Hello?

340
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,673
You testing my patience?

341
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:25,866
I told you to erase the password.

342
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,068
I was just following regulation.

343
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,079
You idiot! I'm your Chief!
Unlock it, now!

344
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:46,897
I'm sorry.
I think I'd better go.

345
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:48,896
I'm really sorry.

346
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,733
Harimao stake-out at NS Hotel
A man went in to meet
the 'Count' 40 minutes ago.

347
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,135
Find out who he is, now!

348
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,775
Mikael Naoumoff.

349
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,274
A former Russian
R.G. Intelligence Sergeant.

350
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,474
Commissioner of the Russian
Chamber of Commerce here.

351
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,279
But that's a fake lD.

352
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,589
You put passwords
on every file?

353
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:25,492
It's regulation...

354
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,096
Who was your trainer?

355
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,395
I can't tell you that, sir.
It's regulation.

356
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:35,800
You idiot!

357
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,411
You learned from Chang-man
didn't you?

358
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,510
Or was it Young-gwang?

359
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,413
Dong-KYu?

360
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:48,818
Joong-sung?

361
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,117
Chief! The Count
ordered room service.

362
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,621
Okay!

363
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,224
I'll go, Chief!

364
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,119
Forget it, boy.

365
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,327
I've been chasing him
since Russia.

366
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,134
I can tell what he's thinking
by the look in his eyes.

367
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,528
Four minutes to delivery, sir.

368
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,135
Let me do it, Chief.

369
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,335
You don't have field experience.

370
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:16,543
I swear on my life, Chief!

371
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:19,346
For the country!

372
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,458
That bastard!

373
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:55,885
You idiot!

374
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,092
Ready! I'm going in!

375
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,406
But don't I get a gun?

376
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,202
Keep forgetting to add 'sir'?
Wanna die?

377
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,210
We don't have guns!

378
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,705
Shit?

379
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:26,607
Did he just say, 'shit'?

380
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,729
Are you trembling?

381
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:41,924
No, sir.

382
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,524
Stupid! Don't answer!

383
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:48,233
I'm sorry, sir.

384
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,634
Don't answer me!

385
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:29,077
Damn bastards
They're pretty good.

386
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,273
- What do you think?
- They're no fools, sir.

387
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,680
- Enough with the obvious!
- Something's fishy, sir.

388
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,285
Enough with the nonsense!

389
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,182
A tighter watch...

390
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,982
Enough with the textbook talk!

391
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,586
No more to say, right?
Just go home.

392
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,395
No, Chief. I can do this!

393
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,999
You couldn't even do
the room service job right.

394
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,437
I don't need you.
Go home.

395
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,301
Start over, boys!

396
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:39,746
What's with you?

397
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,046
How did you get in here?

398
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,345
Your door code's the same.

399
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,254
Put that away!

400
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:47,853
Did you wait long?

401
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:50,758
My company suddenly
called me in.

402
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:51,656
Don't flatter yourself!

403
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,353
Think I went there
just cuz you told me to?

404
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,866
You don't mean
anything to me, now.

405
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,568
- But...
- How much is the late fee?

406
00:33:58,736 --> 00:33:59,862
- But...
- How much is it?

407
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:03,369
Let me talk! Not the head!

408
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,474
Soo-ji, let me explain.

409
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,476
Get out.

410
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:11,872
I came!

411
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,175
I came here didn't l?
Isn't that enough?

412
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,683
Get out! You bastard!

413
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,583
- Get out!
- Ouch!

414
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,687
Soo-ji! Soo-ji!

415
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,291
Get lost!

416
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,594
Open the door now
or it's over!

417
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,701
One, two, three!
Fine! It's over!

418
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,623
I noticed wrinkles
forming on your neck.

419
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:02,129
You should take extra care
ofyour neck wrinkles.

420
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,131
Pull your chin out.

421
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:10,433
Turn your neck to the right
Then hold for 5 seconds.

422
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,540
This works on neck wrinkles?

423
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,246
Yup. It'll make your neck firmer.

424
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,541
Chin out.

425
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,148
Like this?

426
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,349
- Hey, sis?
- Chin out, more?

427
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:28,457
What do I do?

428
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:35,265
I haven't thought of him once
since he left me 3 years ago.

429
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,868
I erased him out of my mind.

430
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,270
But, now what do I do!

431
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,174
Then just date him, again!

432
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:45,866
Crazy?

433
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,572
He left me once.
Who says he won't do it again?

434
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:55,385
I broke up over 1 2 times
with my husband.

435
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,385
But when I tell him it's over

436
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,890
he pretends
he doesn't hear me.

437
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,895
Men are always
different and hard to tell.

438
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:08,498
Hello?
Yes, I'm watching the show.

439
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:13,403
I'd like the 1 2 piece
wrinkle care set.

440
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,302
Yes.

441
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,497
Order mine, too.

442
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,802
Can I pay in installments?
1 0 months?

443
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,307
I've been curious.

444
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,218
What's the team
in our next room?

445
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,314
Don't know.

446
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,520
It's a domestic team, right?

447
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,724
- Don't know.
- Really?

448
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,226
I bet you know
but you're not telling me...

449
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,328
Don't even try to figure out
what they're doing next door.

450
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:46,733
It's regulation.

451
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,348
- Watch it, kid
- Morning, sir.

452
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:09,558
Get up!

453
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,262
- Anything special?
- Nothing much.

454
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,060
They just play cards, take showers
eat, then take showers...

455
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,667
Taking so many showers

456
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,262
when the country's
low on water?

457
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,267
I think they're on to us.

458
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:24,808
What?

459
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,776
Shouldn't we notify our superiors?

460
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:33,076
I will when the time comes
Find anything peculiar?

461
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,080
- Nothing, sir.
- There is, sir!

462
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,380
Right, the new kid
Find anything?

463
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,687
Former Russian spies
were trained

464
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,490
to communicate with cards
when they're being tapped.

465
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:48,495
Really?

466
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,301
By converting the card numbers
to the Cyrillic Alphabet...

467
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,307
Stary Bric'

468
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,910
It means, 'long-time enemy'.

469
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,910
I think it refers
to the killer's target.

470
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,414
Good. Very good.

471
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,425
I'm still analyzing
this scene and this.

472
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,825
I think they used
a double code.

473
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,930
Give me a few days
I can decode it, sir.

474
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,831
The guy's got talent.

475
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:28,836
I'll back you 1 00%%. Jae-joon
You handle it.

476
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,437
The Count's coming out!

477
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,936
- I'll go!
- Shut up and stay put!

478
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,842
- Send him out.
- Yes?

479
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:42,042
Give Jae-joon the chance
to be a true Harimao.

480
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,350
Thank you, sir!

481
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:47,349
He's going down to
the parking lot.

482
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,859
What are you waiting for!

483
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:01,670
Know how to trail someone?

484
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,371
Taxi!

485
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,182
Taxi!

486
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:24,485
Open the door!
Are you ignoring me?

487
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,890
He's coming! Go!

488
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,691
- Can't you hear me!
- Move!

489
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,697
Hey! You son of a bitch!

490
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,112
Victor?

491
00:39:59,096 --> 00:39:59,619
You idiot!

492
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,822
Why are you in front of him?

493
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,229
Trail him! Not escort him!

494
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:12,139
Trail him, you idiot.
Go behind him, now!

495
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,153
Why are you driving like that?

496
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,658
In Korea, it's the fastest
to follow behind cabs.

497
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,065
Stop following me!

498
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,259
That damn idiot.

499
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:41,868
Are you being chased or something!

500
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,477
I did it!

501
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:56,483
Where are they?

502
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,579
They're not there yet.

503
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,189
Then what did you do?

504
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:01,688
I'm finally trailing them, sir!

505
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,687
You idiot!
Who the hell was your trainer!

506
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,311
At the amusement park.

507
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:27,312
And the Count?

508
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:30,212
Still trailing him.

509
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,618
Don't forget to add, 'sir'.
That ain't right.

510
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:35,822
Okay.

511
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:37,818
I give up...

512
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,930
This looks good!

513
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,634
What a way to spend my birthday.

514
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,133
- We don't have the luxury.
- Target's on the move!

515
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,640
Always when I'm eating!

516
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,544
Get ready, people!

517
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,552
Hurry up! Go!

518
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,880
All agents, standby!

519
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:38,783
I think they're on to us.

520
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,082
Get the goods!

521
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:56,401
I beg your pardon.

522
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,904
- Do you know her?
- No.

523
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:13,920
Are you Okay?

524
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,761
Hold on! Pregnant women
aren't allowed in! See?

525
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,462
Wait!

526
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,725
Back off! NlS!

527
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,125
Give me a break, lady.

528
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,414
Ouch!

529
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,282
Can't you do your jobs right!

530
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,078
If it gets out
half the people in Seoul could die!

531
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,087
If it breaks
it's a biochemical weapon!

532
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,083
Use your head!

533
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,287
You... I told you to keep still!
Didn't l!

534
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:52,902
It was an urgent matter, sir.

535
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,702
Look at this!

536
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:04,913
You said you don't have guns!

537
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:08,314
What's this?

538
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,612
You all have guns!

539
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,913
Why don't I get one!

540
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,116
Fine.

541
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,125
I almost died, today!

542
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,231
I'm a Harimao!
Why can't I have a gun

543
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,929
A Harimao?

544
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,530
You?

545
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,741
That's right
I'm a Harimao, too!

546
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,043
Put it on.

547
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:03,063
Thank you
I didn't have an umbrella.

548
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,673
You look tired
Is something wrong?

549
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:10,076
Just some annoying client...

550
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:12,976
I'll see you later.

551
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,183
Well...

552
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,123
I'm sorry.

553
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,096
Did you put it on?

554
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,096
Yes, sir.

555
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:43,108
You think you're ready
to go out on the field?

556
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,305
Of course, sir!

557
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:47,607
Fine.

558
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:51,821
The one who grabs this gun
and shoots first is the winner.

559
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,217
If you win
I walk away from here.

560
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:57,117
If I win

561
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,519
you're dead.

562
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:02,424
Fine, sir.

563
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:20,544
I told you!

564
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,444
If I win, you're dead.

565
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,645
Don't ask to go out
on the field anymore.

566
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,354
An untrained colleague
is more dangerous than the enemy.

567
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,055
A bullet-proof suit
is useless against knives.

568
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,660
But that can even block knives
So wear it.

569
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,104
Where are you?

570
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:17,697
Where are you?

571
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:19,606
Happy birthday!

572
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:22,610
Thanks.

573
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:26,112
Let's start over.

574
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,516
They say it's 3%%..

575
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:33,515
The chance of people who broke up
getting back together for good.

576
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,124
I didn't leave, cuz I wanted to.

577
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,119
It was because of you.

578
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:40,627
You couldn't trust me enough?

579
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,628
But you made it that way.

580
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:43,629
Then fine.

581
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:45,333
Just go.

582
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:52,334
Soo-ji, that's not
what I'm trying to say.

583
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,136
That is what you're saying.

584
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:55,744
It was your fault!

585
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,861
I'm dating someone.

586
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,159
He's a good person.

587
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:22,762
I'm going to marry him.

588
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,694
I'll teach you for real
You'll never forget it.

589
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,799
Attack! Offensif!

590
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,202
Defensif!

591
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,204
Contre offensif!

592
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:52,756
I almost died!

593
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,560
Just when I thought I was dead...

594
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,266
All I could think about was you!

595
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:11,773
I'm sorry.

596
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:17,681
I'm so sorry...

597
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,691
I couldn't even say it.

598
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:38,301
I love you, Soo-ji.

599
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,746
Wait!
