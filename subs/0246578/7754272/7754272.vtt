1
00:04:21.817 --> 00:04:24.153
I'm voting for Dukakis.

2
00:04:29.283 --> 00:04:31.118
Well...

3
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.935
Maybe when you have children
of your own, who need braces...

4
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.715
and you can't afford them because half
of your husband's paycheck

5
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.026
goes to the federal government, you'll...
regret that.

6
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.507
My husband's paycheck?

7
00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.491
Anyway, I'm not gonna squeeze
one out till I'm like 30.

8
00:04:50.637 --> 00:04:52.852
Will you still be working
at the Yarn Barn?

9
00:04:52.957 --> 00:04:55.454
Because I hear that's a really
great place to raise children.

10
00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:56.955
That's really funny.

11
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.687
No, I think a year
of partying's enough.

12
00:04:59.792 --> 00:05:03.275
- She'll be going to Harvard next fall.
- Mom, I haven't even gotten in yet.

13
00:05:03.588 --> 00:05:06.240
Do you honestly think Michael Dukakis
will provide for this country

14
00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:08.760
...till you're ready to squeeze one out?
- Yeah, I do.

15
00:05:09.698 --> 00:05:12.701
- When can I squeeze one out?
- Not until 8th grade.

16
00:05:14.536 --> 00:05:16.726
Excuse me.

17
00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:19.124
Donnie, you're such a dick.

18
00:05:19.645 --> 00:05:21.357
Whoa, Elizabeth!

19
00:05:21.463 --> 00:05:23.210
A little hostile there.

20
00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:25.255
Maybe you should be
the one in therapy,

21
00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:27.241
then Mom and Dad can pay
someone 200 dollars

22
00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:29.021
an hour to listen
to all your thoughts...

23
00:05:29.207 --> 00:05:31.262
so we don't have to.

24
00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:35.473
Okay. You wanna tell Mom and Dad why
you stopped taking your medication?

25
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.351
- You're such a fuck-ass!
- What?!

26
00:05:38.664 --> 00:05:42.022
- Please.
- Did you just call me a fuck-ass?

27
00:05:42.272 --> 00:05:43.845
Elizabeth, that's enough.

28
00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:45.159
You can go suck a fuck!

29
00:05:45.264 --> 00:05:47.928
Oh, please, tell me Elizabeth,
how exactly does one suck a fuck?

30
00:05:48.034 --> 00:05:49.508
- You want me to tell you?
- Please, tell me.

31
00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.219
We will not have this
at the dinner table.

32
00:05:52.365 --> 00:05:54.284
- Stop.
- Fuck...

33
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.900
What's a fuck-ass?

34
00:06:12.197 --> 00:06:16.014
Some part of the reason that I took
a year off was to be with you.

35
00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:21.978
- What?
- How did you know?

36
00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:26.983
- I didn't know it was such a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

37
00:06:35.304 --> 00:06:36.826
I'm reading. Get out of my room.

38
00:06:41.122 --> 00:06:43.416
Where do you go at night?

39
00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:48.545
- Will you just get out of my room?
- Did you toilet-paper the Johnsons' house?

40
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.048
- Is that what you came here to ask me?
- No.

41
00:06:52.654 --> 00:06:55.248
I stopped rolling houses
in the sixth grade, Mom.

42
00:06:55.354 --> 00:06:59.201
What happened to my son? I don't
recognize this person today.

43
00:06:59.265 --> 00:07:01.621
Then why don't you start
taking the goddamn pills.

44
00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:13.696
Bitch.

45
00:07:31.693 --> 00:07:34.091
Our son just called me a bitch.

46
00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:39.868
You're not a bitch.

47
00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:44.393
You're bitchin',
but you're not a bitch.

48
00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:25.100
<i>I want to be a president
of the United States to make sure</i>

49
00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:29.282
<i>that we never again do business
with a drug-running Panamanian dictator</i>

50
00:08:29.388 --> 00:08:31.618
<i>that we never again
funnel aid to the Contras</i>

51
00:08:31.643 --> 00:08:33.194
<i>through convicted drug dealers.</i>

52
00:08:33.275 --> 00:08:35.423
<i>Values begin at the top.</i>

53
00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:37.636
Dukakis...

54
00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:39.634
Son of a bitch.

55
00:08:39.635 --> 00:08:42.600
<i>Those are the values I want to bring
to the presidency and to the White House,</i>

56
00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:44.422
<i>beginning in January of 1989.</i>

57
00:08:44.528 --> 00:08:46.527
<i>- Panama is a friendly country.</i>
- Tell him, George.

58
00:08:46.632 --> 00:08:49.527
<i>I went down there and talked
to the president of Panama</i>

59
00:08:49.633 --> 00:08:52.501
<i>about their cleaning
up their money laundering.</i>

60
00:08:52.607 --> 00:08:56.006
<i>And Mr. Noriega was there, but there
was no evidence at that time.</i>

61
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.843
<i>And when the evidence
was there, we indicted him.</i>

62
00:09:25.472 --> 00:09:27.474
<i>Wake up.</i>

63
00:10:10.246 --> 00:10:12.707
<i>I've been watching you.</i>

64
00:10:57.314 --> 00:10:59.879
<i>Come closer.</i>

65
00:11:09.492 --> 00:11:11.432
<i>Closer.</i>

66
00:11:35.122 --> 00:11:37.291
<i>28 days...</i>

67
00:11:38.584 --> 00:11:40.690
<i>Six hours...</i>

68
00:11:41.107 --> 00:11:43.714
<i>42 minutes...</i>

69
00:11:44.339 --> 00:11:46.383
<i>12 seconds.</i>

70
00:11:51.743 --> 00:11:55.767
<i>That is when the world will end.</i>

71
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.438
Why?

72
00:13:02.897 --> 00:13:05.587
Son? Donnie Darko?

73
00:13:05.795 --> 00:13:09.340
Donnie Darko? What
the heck's going on here?

74
00:13:09.549 --> 00:13:11.175
- Who is it, Don?
- It's Eddie Darko's kid.

75
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.408
I'm sorry about this, Jim.
He's just a neighbourhood kid.

76
00:13:16.118 --> 00:13:18.349
Guess he was sleep-golfing?

77
00:13:19.184 --> 00:13:21.060
Watch out for that drool spot!

78
00:13:24.918 --> 00:13:26.733
Are you all right, son?

79
00:13:32.488 --> 00:13:36.242
So... Let's stay
off the links at night, ok?

80
00:13:37.118 --> 00:13:40.955
I'm... I'm sorry, Dr. Fisher.
It won't happen again.

81
00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:44.876
- Kids...
- Let's golf.

82
00:13:59.995 --> 00:14:01.809
- No one's allowed...
- This is my house.

83
00:14:01.913 --> 00:14:04.478
- I said...
- This is my house!

84
00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:33.987
Wait a minute.

85
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:37.428
- Here's your brother.
- It fell in your room.

86
00:14:57.844 --> 00:15:01.952
Ms. Darko? I'm Bob Garland.
I'm with the FAA.

87
00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:05.504
- The what?
- I'm with the FAA.

88
00:15:05.609 --> 00:15:08.312
If you don't mind, we'd like to speak
to you and your husband privately.

89
00:15:08.417 --> 00:15:10.794
- In private?
- Please.

90
00:15:29.208 --> 00:15:31.523
And here...

91
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:36.688
All right, we have arranged
for you to stay at a hotel.

92
00:15:36.793 --> 00:15:39.155
Get some sleep, and we will take
care of things here.

93
00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:39.841
Great.

94
00:15:39.842 --> 00:15:41.032
Thank you.

95
00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:43.848
Kids, come on. We're
going to a hotel.

96
00:15:44.369 --> 00:15:47.497
They don't know
where it came from.

97
00:16:07.621 --> 00:16:12.981
If it fell from the plane...
then what happened to the plane?

98
00:16:13.085 --> 00:16:15.546
They don't know, Samantha.

99
00:16:16.797 --> 00:16:19.682
Is there any way we can
make money from this?

100
00:16:19.892 --> 00:16:22.010
Can't we get on television
if we sue the airline?

101
00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:24.367
Shut up, Sam.

102
00:16:25.097 --> 00:16:28.705
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie?
He stinks.

103
00:16:29.998 --> 00:16:32.771
When you fall asleep tonight,

104
00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:36.629
- I'm gonna fart in your face.
- I'm telling Mom!

105
00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:39.799
Samantha, don't go over there.

106
00:16:45.618 --> 00:16:47.661
Frankie Feedler.

107
00:16:50.706 --> 00:16:53.876
You remember. From high school.

108
00:17:02.092 --> 00:17:04.115
He died.

109
00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:06.931
Remember?

110
00:17:11.226 --> 00:17:13.374
On his way to the prom.

111
00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:20.360
They said he was doomed.

112
00:17:23.405 --> 00:17:25.344
Jesus.

113
00:17:28.827 --> 00:17:32.477
They could be saying
the same thing about Donnie.

114
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.793
Our Donnie.

115
00:17:41.381 --> 00:17:44.113
But he dodged it.

116
00:17:45.469 --> 00:17:48.451
He dodged his... photograph.

117
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:10.181
Somebody was watching over him.

118
00:18:17.771 --> 00:18:22.318
Mrs. Farmer will bring you home
after practice. Donnie... Bye, honey.

119
00:18:22.422 --> 00:18:24.820
Donnie, good luck.

120
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.408
- Oh, my God! Ok, tell me everything.
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.

121
00:18:29.512 --> 00:18:32.328
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, Cherita.

122
00:18:32.432 --> 00:18:36.206
- Shut up!
- Darko cheats death! Huh?

123
00:18:36.457 --> 00:18:38.661
You're like a celebrity, man!

124
00:18:38.766 --> 00:18:41.231
I've been calling you, like, a jillion
times. Where have you been?

125
00:18:41.337 --> 00:18:44.589
- We stayed at a hotel.
- My dad said he saw you at the golf course.

126
00:18:44.694 --> 00:18:49.303
- You sleepwalking again there, buddy?
- I don't want to talk about it.

127
00:18:49.407 --> 00:18:52.452
And now that you're famous,
you gotta have a smoke.

128
00:18:56.393 --> 00:18:58.833
What happens if you tell Mom
and Dad about this, Sam?

129
00:18:58.937 --> 00:19:03.775
- You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
- Goddamn right, I will.

130
00:19:03.812 --> 00:19:08.238
- So grody.
- Hey, Cherita, you want a cigarette?

131
00:19:08.342 --> 00:19:11.033
- Shut up!
- "Chut up!"

132
00:19:11.241 --> 00:19:13.285
Go back to China, bitch!

133
00:19:16.267 --> 00:19:18.665
Just leave her alone.

134
00:19:18.874 --> 00:19:22.919
- Some good shit, huh?
- It's a fucking cigarette.

135
00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.908
"There would be headlines
in the papers.

136
00:21:59.012 --> 00:22:02.849
Even the grown-up gangs who ran the betting
at the all-in wrestling and the barrow-boys

137
00:22:02.953 --> 00:22:07.291
would hear with respect of how Old
Misery's house had been destroyed.

138
00:22:08.459 --> 00:22:10.585
It was as though this
plan had been with him

139
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:14.072
all his life, pondered
through the seasons,

140
00:22:14.152 --> 00:22:19.053
now, in his 15th year, crystallized
with the pain of puberty...

141
00:22:21.826 --> 00:22:26.143
What is Graham Greene trying
to communicate with this passage?

142
00:22:26.247 --> 00:22:29.897
Why did the children break
into Old Misery's house?

143
00:22:30.564 --> 00:22:33.066
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.

144
00:22:33.734 --> 00:22:36.187
Joanie, if you had actually
read the short story,

145
00:22:36.293 --> 00:22:39.290
which at a whopping 13 pages
would have kept you up all night,

146
00:22:39.396 --> 00:22:44.244
you would know that the children find
a great deal of money in the mattress,

147
00:22:44.348 --> 00:22:46.434
but they burn it.

148
00:22:49.406 --> 00:22:54.129
Donnie Darko, perhaps with your recent
brush with mass destruction,

149
00:22:54.233 --> 00:22:56.402
you can give us your opinion.

150
00:22:57.132 --> 00:22:59.033
Well, they say it
right when they...

151
00:22:59.138 --> 00:23:02.179
flood the house, and they tear
it to shreds, that, like...

152
00:23:02.387 --> 00:23:03.664
destruction is a form
of creation,

153
00:23:03.689 --> 00:23:06.666
so the fact that they burn
the money is ironic.

154
00:23:07.663 --> 00:23:10.979
They just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart.

155
00:23:11.605 --> 00:23:13.482
They want to change things.

156
00:23:20.134 --> 00:23:21.982
May we help you?

157
00:23:22.397 --> 00:23:26.255
Yeah, I just registered, and they put
me in the wrong English class.

158
00:23:26.662 --> 00:23:29.165
You look like you belong here.

159
00:23:29.581 --> 00:23:31.625
Um... Where do I sit?

160
00:23:35.462 --> 00:23:38.423
Sit next to the boy you
think is the cutest.

161
00:23:38.631 --> 00:23:41.867
- Quiet!
- Oh, my God.

162
00:23:41.972 --> 00:23:44.325
Let her choose.

163
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.660
Joanie, get up.

164
00:24:32.935 --> 00:24:35.451
<i>What people don't understand
about this upcoming election</i>

165
00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:39.923
<i>is that Michael Dukakis does not have
the financial infrastructure in place...</i>

166
00:24:46.824 --> 00:24:48.372
Well...

167
00:24:48.581 --> 00:24:52.495
The construction guys say it'll take
about a week to fix the roof.

168
00:24:52.705 --> 00:24:55.791
Damned airline better not
fuck us on the shingle match.

169
00:24:57.168 --> 00:24:59.879
- They still don't know?
- Know what?

170
00:25:00.755 --> 00:25:03.549
- Where it came from?
- Oh, no.

171
00:25:03.653 --> 00:25:07.052
Apparently they can't tell us
what happened yet. Something about...

172
00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:10.556
Matching a serial
number that got burned.

173
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:14.060
I had to sign a form saying
I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

174
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:19.461
So we're not supposed to tell
anyone what nobody knows?

175
00:25:19.607 --> 00:25:22.839
Yes. But you tell...

176
00:25:24.612 --> 00:25:27.373
- What's your doctor's name?
- Dr. Thurman, Dad.

177
00:25:27.582 --> 00:25:30.743
Yes. You tell Dr. Thurman
whatever you want.

178
00:25:31.973 --> 00:25:33.183
- Dad.
- What?

179
00:25:33.329 --> 00:25:34.455
Dad!

180
00:25:39.939 --> 00:25:44.673
What's that woman doing standing
out in the middle of the damn road?!

181
00:25:57.916 --> 00:26:00.814
No mail today. Maybe tomorrow.

182
00:26:17.518 --> 00:26:20.146
Well, what did she say to you?

183
00:26:26.736 --> 00:26:30.072
- I made a new friend.
- Real or imaginary?

184
00:26:30.323 --> 00:26:33.805
- Imaginary.
- Would you like to talk about this friend?

185
00:26:34.681 --> 00:26:36.996
- Frank.
- Frank.

186
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.291
- What did Frank say?
- He said to follow him.

187
00:26:40.395 --> 00:26:43.774
- Follow him? Where?
- Into the future.

188
00:26:43.982 --> 00:26:46.276
And then what happens?

189
00:26:47.923 --> 00:26:50.009
And then he said...

190
00:26:51.114 --> 00:26:54.347
Then he said that the world
was coming to an end.

191
00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.059
Do you think the world
is coming to an end?

192
00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:03.919
No.

193
00:27:05.837 --> 00:27:07.672
That's stupid.

194
00:27:09.487 --> 00:27:14.992
<i>For my entire life,
I was a victim of my own fear.</i>

195
00:27:15.305 --> 00:27:16.931
<i>Love.</i>

196
00:27:17.849 --> 00:27:21.186
<i>I was feeding fear with food.</i>

197
00:27:25.169 --> 00:27:26.775
<i>Fear.</i>

198
00:27:33.636 --> 00:27:35.679
<i>And finally, I looked
in the mirror.</i>

199
00:27:36.096 --> 00:27:40.538
<i>Not just in the mirror.
I looked through the mirror.</i>

200
00:27:40.997 --> 00:27:44.959
<i>In that image, I saw
my ego reflection.</i>

201
00:27:48.358 --> 00:27:52.571
<i>For two years, I thought it was normal
for a 10-year-old to wet the bed.</i>

202
00:27:52.925 --> 00:27:55.428
<i>We tried everything.</i>

203
00:27:58.619 --> 00:28:01.642
<i>But the solution
was there all the time.</i>

204
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.458
<i>I'm not afraid anymore!</i>

205
00:28:06.043 --> 00:28:10.818
<i>All over America, people have
come together to join hands.</i>

206
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:18.242
<i>People who believe that human
life is absolutely too important,</i>

207
00:28:18.347 --> 00:28:23.206
<i>too valuable and too precious
to be controlled by fear.</i>

208
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:27.210
<i>Pay close attention. You
could miss something.</i>

209
00:28:27.314 --> 00:28:32.590
<i>Hello. My name is Jim Cunningham.
And welcome to "Controlling Fear".</i>

210
00:29:35.944 --> 00:29:40.532
"... and the prince was led into a world
of strange and beautiful magic".

211
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:42.075
Wow.

212
00:29:44.098 --> 00:29:47.038
- Donnie!
- "The Last Unicorn" by Samantha Darko.

213
00:29:47.143 --> 00:29:49.590
- Give it back!
- "There was once a unicorn named Ariel..."

214
00:29:49.591 --> 00:29:51.357
Donnie...

215
00:29:52.794 --> 00:29:55.104
- You wrinkled it.
- It's not wrinkled, Sam, just...

216
00:29:55.209 --> 00:29:56.589
You know, flatten it
in a book or something.

217
00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:00.302
It's almost 7:45. The bus
should've been here like 20 minutes ago.

218
00:30:00.406 --> 00:30:03.033
Maybe Martha Moo finally went
nuts and hijacked the bus.

219
00:30:03.138 --> 00:30:06.829
Hey, you know, there's like this
rule, at 7:45 we get to go home.

220
00:30:06.975 --> 00:30:08.372
There's no rule.

221
00:30:08.581 --> 00:30:12.981
Cherita, you should... go home.

222
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:15.465
Yeah. Yeah, if you're still
here when the bus comes,

223
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.863
we're all gonna
get in trouble.

224
00:30:16.943 --> 00:30:19.029
- Shut up!
- "Chut up!"

225
00:30:19.133 --> 00:30:23.950
Hey, Porky Pig, I hope
you get molested.

226
00:30:25.956 --> 00:30:28.288
Oh my God. Can't believe this.

227
00:30:30.332 --> 00:30:32.896
My mom said that school is closed
today because it's flooded.

228
00:30:33.001 --> 00:30:34.961
- No way!
- Yeah.

229
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.194
Holy shit! That's the best
news I've ever heard!

230
00:30:44.721 --> 00:30:47.745
My God, is this
ever going to stop?

231
00:30:47.849 --> 00:30:52.896
Eventually, yes, it will. But right now
I got 12 classrooms full of water.

232
00:30:53.104 --> 00:30:55.502
All coming from a busted
water main.

233
00:30:56.232 --> 00:30:58.651
- What else?
- What else?

234
00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.321
Principal Cole, I'll show
you what else.

235
00:31:04.866 --> 00:31:07.994
That's unbelievable.
That's solid bronze, isn't it?

236
00:31:08.098 --> 00:31:09.829
- Yep.
- How did this happen?

237
00:31:10.184 --> 00:31:13.187
I heard a cat burglar broke
in and trashed everything.

238
00:31:13.396 --> 00:31:15.690
And the Mongrel got
his head cut off.

239
00:31:16.774 --> 00:31:17.837
True!

240
00:31:24.865 --> 00:31:26.852
Beth's mom said the boys'
locker room was flooded,

241
00:31:26.977 --> 00:31:29.060
and they found
feces everywhere.

242
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.663
- What are feces?
- Baby mice.

243
00:31:44.176 --> 00:31:45.510
Hey.

244
00:31:46.949 --> 00:31:49.473
Has anyone ever told
you that you're sexy?

245
00:31:50.411 --> 00:31:52.455
I like your boobs.

246
00:31:53.393 --> 00:31:54.644
Hey.

247
00:31:55.687 --> 00:31:56.938
Hey.

248
00:31:57.814 --> 00:31:59.545
School's canceled.

249
00:32:01.985 --> 00:32:03.820
Do you wanna walk me home?

250
00:32:04.863 --> 00:32:06.177
Sure.

251
00:32:15.603 --> 00:32:18.773
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not. Just...

252
00:32:18.877 --> 00:32:20.892
You should check your backpack.
These guys love to steal shit.

253
00:32:20.901 --> 00:32:22.381
No. Fuck 'em!

254
00:32:25.592 --> 00:32:29.158
- So, why'd you move here?
- My parents got a divorce.

255
00:32:29.262 --> 00:32:32.499
My mom had to get a restraining
order against my stepdad.

256
00:32:32.604 --> 00:32:34.350
He has emotional problems.

257
00:32:34.455 --> 00:32:38.020
Oh, I have those too. What kind
of emotional problems does your dad have?

258
00:32:38.125 --> 00:32:40.899
He stabbed my mom four
times in the chest.

259
00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:45.341
Oh. Did he go to jail?

260
00:32:45.862 --> 00:32:49.136
No, he fled. They
still can't find him.

261
00:32:49.345 --> 00:32:51.996
But my mom and I had
to change our names, and...

262
00:32:52.102 --> 00:32:54.182
I thought Gretchen
Ross was pretty cool.

263
00:32:55.225 --> 00:32:59.396
I was in jail once. I mean...
I accidentally burned down this house.

264
00:32:59.605 --> 00:33:01.595
It was abandoned,
but still, I...

265
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:06.131
You know, I got held back in school
and I can't drive till I'm 21, you know...

266
00:33:06.236 --> 00:33:07.946
But I'm over all of that.

267
00:33:09.093 --> 00:33:11.721
I'm... painting and stuff.

268
00:33:12.034 --> 00:33:16.413
Writing. I want to be a writer. Maybe
painter. I don't know, maybe both...

269
00:33:16.517 --> 00:33:19.854
I'll write a book
and draw the pictures.

270
00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:23.775
Then maybe people will understand me.
I don't know, change things.

271
00:33:24.192 --> 00:33:27.251
Donnie Darko, what the hell kind
of name is that? It's like...

272
00:33:27.356 --> 00:33:29.865
some sort of superhero
or something.

273
00:33:30.802 --> 00:33:32.533
What makes you think I'm not?

274
00:33:37.267 --> 00:33:42.522
Look, I should go. For physics, Montinoff
is having me write this essay.

275
00:33:42.627 --> 00:33:45.296
Greatest invention ever
to benefit mankind.

276
00:33:48.153 --> 00:33:51.636
It's Monnitoff. But that's easy.
Antiseptics.

277
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:56.453
Like, the whole sanitation thing.
Joseph Lister, 1895.

278
00:33:56.557 --> 00:34:00.290
Before antiseptics there was no
sanitation, especially in medicine.

279
00:34:00.811 --> 00:34:02.438
You mean soap?

280
00:34:09.111 --> 00:34:12.093
Well, I'm really glad
school was flooded today.

281
00:34:12.198 --> 00:34:13.678
Why is that?

282
00:34:15.034 --> 00:34:17.599
Because you and I never
would have had this conversation.

283
00:34:19.246 --> 00:34:20.977
You're weird.

284
00:34:22.124 --> 00:34:23.605
Sorry.

285
00:34:23.709 --> 00:34:25.753
No, that was a compliment.

286
00:34:29.736 --> 00:34:31.884
Well, look, uh...

287
00:34:34.324 --> 00:34:35.992
You want to go with me?

288
00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.740
Where do you want to go?

289
00:34:40.053 --> 00:34:43.595
No, I mean, like, "go" with me.
Like, you know... Like...

290
00:34:43.805 --> 00:34:45.538
That's what we call it here.

291
00:34:45.748 --> 00:34:47.651
- "Going together".
- Sure.

292
00:34:51.382 --> 00:34:53.363
Ok. Hey, where are you going?

293
00:34:55.783 --> 00:34:57.597
I'm going home.

294
00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:03.811
Stupid...

295
00:35:04.824 --> 00:35:06.941
"Where are you going?".

296
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.325
I'd like to try something
new this time.

297
00:35:19.473 --> 00:35:21.829
Have you ever been hypnotized?

298
00:35:23.352 --> 00:35:24.936
No.

299
00:35:34.091 --> 00:35:38.095
And when I clap my hands twice, you
will wake up. Do you understand?

300
00:35:39.096 --> 00:35:44.644
- Yes.
- So, tell me about your week.

301
00:35:44.748 --> 00:35:47.063
I met a girl.

302
00:35:49.523 --> 00:35:51.379
What is her name?

303
00:35:51.588 --> 00:35:53.319
Gretchen.

304
00:35:54.779 --> 00:35:56.822
We're going together now.

305
00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.786
Do you still think
about girls a lot?

306
00:36:02.641 --> 00:36:04.392
Yeah.

307
00:36:07.604 --> 00:36:12.963
- How are things going at school?
- I think about girls a lot.

308
00:36:13.172 --> 00:36:15.257
I asked you
about school, Donnie.

309
00:36:15.674 --> 00:36:19.157
I think about fucking
a lot during school.

310
00:36:20.825 --> 00:36:23.072
What else do you think
about during school?

311
00:36:23.797 --> 00:36:25.604
"Married With Children".

312
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.876
- You think about your family?
- I just turn down the volume

313
00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.733
and think about fucking
Christina Applegate.

314
00:36:32.837 --> 00:36:35.840
I asked you
about your family, Donnie.

315
00:36:35.944 --> 00:36:37.404
No.

316
00:36:38.655 --> 00:36:42.117
I don't think about fucking my family.
That's gross.

317
00:36:43.181 --> 00:36:45.662
I'd like to hear
about your friend Frank.

318
00:37:02.804 --> 00:37:04.556
Sam Bylan.

319
00:37:14.358 --> 00:37:16.172
Cherita Chen.

320
00:37:35.337 --> 00:37:37.130
Donald Darko.

321
00:37:59.882 --> 00:38:01.675
Daye Dennis.

322
00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:08.953
Hey, you fuck!

323
00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:12.832
Did you tell 'em
that I flooded the school?

324
00:38:14.939 --> 00:38:16.254
I didn't say shit.

325
00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.754
Yeah, well, that's not what I heard.
They think I did it.

326
00:38:18.859 --> 00:38:22.175
Yeah, well, if you're innocent, then you
have nothing to worry about, right?

327
00:38:23.364 --> 00:38:25.783
Fuck you! You know what I think?

328
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.369
I think you did it.

329
00:38:44.968 --> 00:38:48.180
Beer and pussy,
that's all I need.

330
00:38:48.284 --> 00:38:51.871
- So we gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
- Smurfette?

331
00:38:51.975 --> 00:38:55.895
Mm-hm. Not some, like, tight-ass
Middlesex chick, you know?

332
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.498
Like, this cute little blonde that'll get
down and dirty with the guys,

333
00:38:59.604 --> 00:39:01.256
like Smurfette does.

334
00:39:01.568 --> 00:39:03.737
Smurfette doesn't fuck.

335
00:39:05.572 --> 00:39:07.953
That's bullshit. Smurfette
fucks all the other Smurfs.

336
00:39:08.058 --> 00:39:10.055
Why do you think
Papa Smurf made her?

337
00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.704
Because all the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.

338
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.612
- Not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.
- Ok, well, you know what, then...

339
00:39:16.718 --> 00:39:20.315
She fucks them
while Vanity watches. Ok?

340
00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.380
What about Papa Smurf? I mean,
he must get in some of the action?

341
00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:29.596
Yeah, what he does, he films the gang-bang.
Later on, he beats off to the tape.

342
00:39:31.139 --> 00:39:35.081
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't
create Smurfette. Gargamel did.

343
00:39:35.117 --> 00:39:38.457
She was sent in as Gargamel's evil
spy, with the intention...

344
00:39:38.562 --> 00:39:41.423
of destroying the Smurf village,
but the overwhelming goodness

345
00:39:41.529 --> 00:39:44.444
of the Smurf way of life
transformed her.

346
00:39:44.798 --> 00:39:47.364
And as for the whole
gang-bang scenario...

347
00:39:48.476 --> 00:39:49.761
it just couldn't happen!

348
00:39:49.866 --> 00:39:52.431
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have...

349
00:39:53.025 --> 00:39:56.498
reproductive organs, under those
little white pants.

350
00:39:58.083 --> 00:40:02.003
That's what's so illogical, you
know, about being a Smurf.

351
00:40:02.358 --> 00:40:04.332
What's the point of living...

352
00:40:04.855 --> 00:40:06.592
if you don't have a dick?

353
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.911
Damn it, Donnie, why do you
gotta get so smart on us?

354
00:40:15.204 --> 00:40:16.454
Grandma Death.

355
00:40:16.559 --> 00:40:19.875
Excuse me! Excuse me!

356
00:40:21.126 --> 00:40:23.013
Please stay off the road,
Miss Sparrow.

357
00:40:23.119 --> 00:40:25.818
If this happens again I am
going to call Social Services.

358
00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:29.885
And I hate that Miss Farmer.
Such a fucking bitch!

359
00:40:30.177 --> 00:40:31.637
Yeah.

360
00:40:32.992 --> 00:40:35.828
- How old is Grandma Death?
- 101.

361
00:40:37.267 --> 00:40:39.874
She does the same
thing every day.

362
00:40:40.354 --> 00:40:45.609
Just walks back and forth and back
and forth to the mailbox.

363
00:40:47.215 --> 00:40:48.841
Nothing ever in there.

364
00:40:51.573 --> 00:40:53.304
Oh, wait, wait, wait...

365
00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:00.248
She goes... She's going back to the box.
We may still have mail.

366
00:41:00.353 --> 00:41:02.355
- Mail, mail, mail. Mail.
- Here it is.

367
00:41:02.667 --> 00:41:04.273
This could be it.

368
00:41:05.879 --> 00:41:10.571
- Oh, no dice, Grandma. No, sorry. Sorry.
- Someone ought to write that bitch.

369
00:41:11.343 --> 00:41:13.094
<i>Authorities continued
their search today,</i>

370
00:41:13.199 --> 00:41:16.577
<i>for a suspect in the Middlesex
Ridge School vandalism.</i>

371
00:41:16.681 --> 00:41:18.967
<i>The private school has
asked for public donations</i>

372
00:41:18.992 --> 00:41:21.189
<i>to help restore its
beloved mascot,</i>

373
00:41:21.269 --> 00:41:23.667
<i>known only as the Mongrel.
In other news...</i>

374
00:41:30.737 --> 00:41:35.909
It's very helpful. You wanted one? So
glad there's a good turnout tonight.

375
00:41:37.202 --> 00:41:39.600
What are you trying
to accomplish here?

376
00:41:39.704 --> 00:41:43.854
There was urine and feces
flooded in my office.

377
00:41:44.918 --> 00:41:46.649
Whatever fits.

378
00:41:48.901 --> 00:41:50.632
"Whatever fits"?

379
00:41:51.153 --> 00:41:53.843
In cooperation
with the county police,

380
00:41:53.947 --> 00:41:58.369
we have begun an active investigation
into the cause of the flooding.

381
00:41:58.515 --> 00:42:02.331
And our suspects include several
of our own students. Now...

382
00:42:02.539 --> 00:42:07.086
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

383
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:20.203
Kitty, I would appreciate,
if you would wait...

384
00:42:20.307 --> 00:42:27.397
Dr. Cole, not only am I a teacher, but I am
also a parent of a Middlesex child.

385
00:42:27.648 --> 00:42:33.153
Therefore I am the only person here
who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

386
00:42:36.677 --> 00:42:38.367
<i>Don't worry.</i>

387
00:42:39.962 --> 00:42:41.432
<i>You got away with it.</i>

388
00:42:41.536 --> 00:42:45.436
I have in my hand Graham
Greene's "The Destructors".

389
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:50.274
This short story is part
of my daughter's English assignment.

390
00:42:50.378 --> 00:42:56.530
In this story, several children destroy
an elderly man's house from inside out.

391
00:43:10.231 --> 00:43:12.129
How can you do that?

392
00:43:18.969 --> 00:43:25.976
And how do they do this? They flood
the house by breaking through a water main.

393
00:43:27.811 --> 00:43:30.418
<i>I can do anything that I want.</i>

394
00:43:31.836 --> 00:43:33.463
<i>And so can you.</i>

395
00:43:37.112 --> 00:43:40.407
And I think that this
garbage should be removed!

396
00:43:40.512 --> 00:43:42.159
Excuse me.

397
00:43:42.541 --> 00:43:45.704
What is the real issue here?
The PTA doesn't ban books.

398
00:43:45.808 --> 00:43:48.225
The PTA is here to acknowledge

399
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:51.567
that pornography is being
taught in our curriculum!

400
00:43:51.648 --> 00:43:54.708
- It's meant to be ironic.
- Excuse me.

401
00:43:54.813 --> 00:43:57.278
You need to go back
to grad school.

402
00:43:57.716 --> 00:43:59.885
Why did you make me
flood the school?

403
00:44:05.432 --> 00:44:07.205
<i>They are in great danger.</i>

404
00:44:07.455 --> 00:44:11.146
Kittie. Do you even know
who Graham Greene is?

405
00:44:11.542 --> 00:44:14.691
I think we have
all seen "Bonanza".

406
00:44:17.319 --> 00:44:18.991
Well, um...

407
00:44:19.514 --> 00:44:21.448
While we are on other topics...

408
00:44:21.657 --> 00:44:23.346
Where did you come from?

409
00:44:25.327 --> 00:44:27.913
<i>Do you believe in time travel?</i>

410
00:44:30.457 --> 00:44:32.250
Who are you talking to?

411
00:44:37.026 --> 00:44:39.007
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

412
00:44:50.122 --> 00:44:52.520
A storm is coming, Frank says.

413
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.399
A storm that will swallow
the children.

414
00:44:57.171 --> 00:44:59.861
And I'll deliver them
from the kingdom of pain.

415
00:45:01.425 --> 00:45:03.744
I'll deliver the children
back to their doorsteps,

416
00:45:03.849 --> 00:45:06.596
I'll send the monsters
back to the underground.

417
00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.684
I'll send them back to a place
where no one else can see them.

418
00:45:11.936 --> 00:45:13.562
Except for me.

419
00:45:15.314 --> 00:45:17.462
Because I am Donnie Darko.

420
00:45:26.742 --> 00:45:28.056
Who is Frank?

421
00:45:34.917 --> 00:45:37.169
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.

422
00:45:43.675 --> 00:45:49.807
<i>In these modern times, our attitude
and beliefs are so delicate, so fragile.</i>

423
00:45:49.911 --> 00:45:55.208
<i>I have had a Cunning Vision.
This vision has released me.</i>

424
00:45:55.312 --> 00:45:59.942
<i>It's important that our lifeline be
rejuvenated, so that we can breathe again.</i>

425
00:46:00.984 --> 00:46:02.924
<i>It's time to breathe.</i>

426
00:46:03.904 --> 00:46:05.968
<i>It is time to breathe.</i>

427
00:46:06.761 --> 00:46:08.909
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>

428
00:46:10.014 --> 00:46:12.308
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>

429
00:46:13.518 --> 00:46:18.648
<i>So now let us begin Lifeline Exercise
Number One. Please press stop now.</i>

430
00:46:26.176 --> 00:46:31.681
As you can see, the lifeline
is divided into two polar extremes.

431
00:46:31.786 --> 00:46:34.038
Fear and love.

432
00:46:34.184 --> 00:46:38.459
Fear is in the negative
energy spectrum.

433
00:46:38.501 --> 00:46:41.399
And love is in the positive
energy spectrum.

434
00:46:41.504 --> 00:46:44.215
- No, duh...
- Excuse me?

435
00:46:44.527 --> 00:46:48.427
"No, duh" is a product of fear.

436
00:46:49.512 --> 00:46:50.888
Now...

437
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:56.894
On each card is a character dilemma
which applies to the lifeline.

438
00:46:59.334 --> 00:47:03.004
Please... Take this. Thank you.

439
00:47:03.505 --> 00:47:06.549
Please read each character
dilemma aloud,

440
00:47:06.758 --> 00:47:11.033
and place an "X" on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

441
00:47:11.575 --> 00:47:13.202
Cherita?

442
00:47:21.689 --> 00:47:24.546
"Juanita has an important
math test today.

443
00:47:24.651 --> 00:47:29.384
She's known about the test for several
weeks, but has not studied.

444
00:47:29.489 --> 00:47:32.440
In order to keep
from failing her class,

445
00:47:32.544 --> 00:47:36.558
Juanita decides that she will cheat
on the math test...

446
00:47:39.624 --> 00:47:41.834
Good. Good. Very good.

447
00:47:42.397 --> 00:47:44.024
Mr. Darko.

448
00:47:52.699 --> 00:47:54.743
"Ling Ling finds a wallet
on the ground filled with money.

449
00:47:54.847 --> 00:47:56.874
She takes the wallet to the address
on the driver's licence

450
00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:59.393
but keeps the money
inside the wallet".

451
00:48:01.646 --> 00:48:03.689
I'm sorry, Miss Farmer.
I don't get this.

452
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.922
Just place an "X" on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

453
00:48:07.756 --> 00:48:10.112
No. I mean, I know what to do.
I just... I don't get this.

454
00:48:10.217 --> 00:48:11.699
You can't just lump things
into two categories.

455
00:48:11.724 --> 00:48:13.094
Things aren't that simple.

456
00:48:13.553 --> 00:48:16.723
The lifeline
is divided that way.

457
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:19.830
Well, life isn't that simple.
I mean...

458
00:48:19.935 --> 00:48:23.634
Who cares if Ling Ling returns
the wallet and keeps the money.

459
00:48:23.739 --> 00:48:25.565
It has nothing to do
with either fear or love.

460
00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:28.547
Fear and love are the deepest
of human emotions.

461
00:48:28.652 --> 00:48:31.550
Ok. But you're not
listening to me.

462
00:48:31.759 --> 00:48:34.845
There are other things to need to be
taken into account here, like,

463
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:38.348
the whole spectrum of human emotion.
You can't just...

464
00:48:38.453 --> 00:48:41.726
lump everything into these two categories
and then just deny everything else!

465
00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:45.710
If you don't complete the assignment,
you'll get a zero for the day.

466
00:48:50.778 --> 00:48:54.302
Donald, let me preface
this by saying

467
00:48:54.406 --> 00:48:57.368
that your Iowa
Test scores are...

468
00:48:58.723 --> 00:49:00.537
intimidating.

469
00:49:02.393 --> 00:49:03.916
So...

470
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.651
Let's go over this again. What
exactly did you say to Miss Farmer?

471
00:49:11.819 --> 00:49:13.529
I'll tell you what he said.

472
00:49:13.863 --> 00:49:18.430
He asked me to forcibly insert
the lifeline exercise card into my anus!

473
00:49:34.967 --> 00:49:39.889
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values...

474
00:49:43.476 --> 00:49:44.811
Kitty...

475
00:49:45.895 --> 00:49:47.626
Excuse us, please.

476
00:49:52.109 --> 00:49:56.218
They've suspended him from after-school
activities for the next six months.

477
00:49:58.824 --> 00:50:02.912
Ever since this jet engine fiasco,
I honestly don't know what's gotten into...

478
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.538
Rose, I'll tell you this
because our daughters have been

479
00:50:05.644 --> 00:50:09.563
on the dance team together for two years,
and I respect you as a woman,

480
00:50:09.669 --> 00:50:12.030
but after witnessing
your son's behaviour this afternoon,

481
00:50:12.129 --> 00:50:14.632
I have significant
doubts about your...

482
00:50:17.426 --> 00:50:20.064
Our paths through life
must be righteous.

483
00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:22.914
I urge you to go home
and look in the mirror

484
00:50:22.994 --> 00:50:27.061
and pray that your son doesn't
succumb to the path of fear.

485
00:50:32.775 --> 00:50:37.363
Do you remember that weird
gym teacher, Mrs. Farmer?

486
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:43.723
Yeah. Ok, well, my brother told her
to shove a book up her ass today.

487
00:50:43.827 --> 00:50:47.060
And then my parents just
bought him all this new shit.

488
00:50:48.102 --> 00:50:51.856
Yeah, I know. I wish a jet
engine would fall on my room.

489
00:51:10.103 --> 00:51:12.314
- Dr. Monnitoff.
- Donnie.

490
00:51:13.795 --> 00:51:16.047
I know this is gonna sound
kind of weird, but...

491
00:51:17.588 --> 00:51:19.277
Do you know anything about...

492
00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.094
time travel?

493
00:51:26.057 --> 00:51:30.374
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen
bridge, which is,

494
00:51:30.483 --> 00:51:34.711
theoretically a wormhole
in space controlled by man.

495
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:42.511
So, according to Hawking, a wormhole
may be able to provide a shortcut

496
00:51:42.615 --> 00:51:45.701
for jumping between two distant
regions of space-time.

497
00:51:45.806 --> 00:51:48.767
So in order to travel back in time,
you have to have a big spaceship,

498
00:51:48.871 --> 00:51:50.852
or something that can travel
faster than the speed of light.

499
00:51:50.957 --> 00:51:51.718
Theoretically.

500
00:51:51.743 --> 00:51:54.025
And be able to find
one of these wormholes.

501
00:51:54.418 --> 00:51:56.461
The basic principles
of time travel are there.

502
00:51:56.566 --> 00:51:58.214
You got your vessel
and your portal.

503
00:51:58.318 --> 00:52:01.446
And your vessel could be just
about anything, most likely a spacecraft.

504
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:04.220
- Like a DeLorean?
- Metal craft of any kind.

505
00:52:04.324 --> 00:52:07.848
You know, I love that movie. The
way they shot it. It's so...

506
00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:10.580
Like, futuristic, you know?

507
00:52:11.915 --> 00:52:15.919
Listen, um... Don't tell
anybody that I gave you this.

508
00:52:16.023 --> 00:52:18.213
The woman who wrote this
used to teach here.

509
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:21.591
She was a nun, many years
before that, but...

510
00:52:21.904 --> 00:52:24.240
And then overnight she just...

511
00:52:24.354 --> 00:52:26.741
She became this entirely
different person.

512
00:52:26.846 --> 00:52:30.225
She... up and left the church,
she wrote this book...

513
00:52:31.163 --> 00:52:32.998
She started teaching science.

514
00:52:33.374 --> 00:52:35.188
Right here at Middlesex.

515
00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:37.941
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".

516
00:52:39.838 --> 00:52:41.548
Roberta Sparrow?

517
00:52:42.403 --> 00:52:43.947
That's right.

518
00:52:45.071 --> 00:52:45.871
Come on...

519
00:52:47.533 --> 00:52:49.264
Roberta Sparrow?

520
00:53:08.909 --> 00:53:11.057
Roberta Sparrow.

521
00:53:12.558 --> 00:53:14.498
Grandma Death.

522
00:53:34.247 --> 00:53:36.457
It's called "The Philosophy
of Time Travel".

523
00:53:37.854 --> 00:53:40.150
What does philosophy have to do
with do with time travel?

524
00:53:40.252 --> 00:53:41.712
Guess who wrote it.

525
00:53:42.088 --> 00:53:43.422
Who?

526
00:53:44.215 --> 00:53:47.760
Roberta Sparrow. Huh!
She wrote a book.

527
00:53:48.573 --> 00:53:50.679
Grandma Death wrote a book.

528
00:53:50.992 --> 00:53:53.078
That's a terrible nickname.

529
00:53:54.016 --> 00:53:56.393
We almost hit her
with the car the other day.

530
00:53:57.645 --> 00:54:02.441
She lives up there in that piece of crap
house, and you know she's loaded. She's...

531
00:54:02.545 --> 00:54:07.404
Yeah, you're right. She used to be
known for her gem collection.

532
00:54:07.613 --> 00:54:12.910
Kids used to go up there all the time
and try to steal stuff from her.

533
00:54:13.681 --> 00:54:15.663
She became a total recluse.

534
00:54:17.831 --> 00:54:21.022
I didn't know she was alive till we damn
near knocked her down the other day.

535
00:54:25.944 --> 00:54:28.196
<i>She was just standing there,
in the middle of the road, frozen.</i>

536
00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:32.784
<i>So, I got out of the car and I walked
over to see if she was ok.</i>

537
00:54:33.347 --> 00:54:35.933
And she leaned over,
and whispered in my ear.

538
00:54:36.141 --> 00:54:37.914
- What did she say?
- I mean, I think Frank wants me to

539
00:54:38.018 --> 00:54:41.355
go talk to her, you know,
because the last time I saw him...

540
00:54:41.563 --> 00:54:43.482
He asked me if I knew
about time travel.

541
00:54:43.586 --> 00:54:46.985
And she wrote a book about it, so
that can't be like a coincidence, right?

542
00:54:50.718 --> 00:54:53.179
Donnie, what did Roberta
Sparrow say to you?

543
00:54:55.223 --> 00:54:58.330
She said that every living
creature on earth dies alone.

544
00:55:02.855 --> 00:55:04.732
How did that make you feel?

545
00:55:08.945 --> 00:55:11.113
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

546
00:55:13.136 --> 00:55:16.807
She died when I was eight and she crawled
underneath the...

547
00:55:17.745 --> 00:55:19.226
the porch.

548
00:55:22.375 --> 00:55:23.876
To die.

549
00:55:26.796 --> 00:55:28.381
To be alone.

550
00:55:29.965 --> 00:55:32.239
Do you feel alone right now?

551
00:55:37.765 --> 00:55:39.412
I don't know...

552
00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:44.584
I mean, I'd like to believe
I'm not, but I just...

553
00:55:45.731 --> 00:55:48.129
I've just never seen
any proof, so I...

554
00:55:48.922 --> 00:55:51.257
I just don't debate it anymore, you know.
It's like...

555
00:55:51.362 --> 00:55:54.442
I could spend my whole life
debating it over and over again,

556
00:55:54.547 --> 00:55:57.931
weighing the pros and cons, and in the end,
I still wouldn't have proof, so I just...

557
00:55:58.035 --> 00:56:00.600
I just don't debate it anymore.

558
00:56:01.851 --> 00:56:03.520
It's absurd.

559
00:56:06.961 --> 00:56:08.796
The search for God is absurd?

560
00:56:11.705 --> 00:56:13.613
It is if everyone dies alone.

561
00:56:15.041 --> 00:56:16.637
Does that scare you?

562
00:56:20.328 --> 00:56:22.101
I don't want to be alone.

563
00:56:35.843 --> 00:56:38.137
And so his tapes
have made me realise

564
00:56:38.242 --> 00:56:43.455
that for the last 39 years, I have
been a prisoner of my own fear.

565
00:56:44.164 --> 00:56:45.436
Fear.

566
00:56:46.375 --> 00:56:49.023
Rose, you have got to meet
this Jim Cunningham.

567
00:56:50.587 --> 00:56:52.527
I can't believe he is single.

568
00:56:53.611 --> 00:56:58.282
<i>And it has been a disappointing night
indeed for these Super Bowl champions.</i>

569
00:56:58.491 --> 00:56:59.669
<i>You're right, Dan.</i>

570
00:56:59.773 --> 00:57:03.186
<i>Coach Joe Gibbs is on the sidelines,
water dripping off his glasses,</i>

571
00:57:03.291 --> 00:57:06.499
<i>but he's gotta be thinking, "What happened?
What went wrong tonight?"</i>

572
00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.522
<i>And here's the kick.</i>

573
00:57:09.835 --> 00:57:11.566
<i>It's no good...</i>

574
00:57:12.505 --> 00:57:15.529
- Shit, we need a quarterback.
- We need a miracle.

575
00:57:15.633 --> 00:57:18.802
- We need to go for a safety.
<i>- ... so what the future holds</i>

576
00:57:18.907 --> 00:57:22.765
<i>for this Super Bowl MVP, we're
just gonna have to wait and see.</i>

577
00:57:32.858 --> 00:57:34.381
You guys want anything?

578
00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:36.591
<i>By the way, this week
on a special "Who's The Boss?",</i>

579
00:57:36.695 --> 00:57:38.572
<i>starring Tony Danza
and Judith Light,</i>

580
00:57:38.677 --> 00:57:42.681
<i>Samantha borrows Tony's van
and gets caught without a licence.</i>

581
00:57:42.785 --> 00:57:45.600
<i>Well, we're gonna make sure
we don't miss that one, ah?</i>

582
00:57:47.102 --> 00:57:48.520
<i>Here we are again.</i>

583
00:57:49.823 --> 00:57:51.335
<i>Fourth down now...</i>

584
00:57:53.024 --> 00:57:54.463
<i>Here's the kick...</i>

585
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:35.397
Ok, let's not forget tomorrow
we're meeting with our partners

586
00:59:35.501 --> 00:59:37.378
for the Young Inventors' Fair.

587
00:59:37.482 --> 00:59:39.046
What happened to your neck?

588
00:59:39.202 --> 00:59:39.776
What?

589
00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.386
The blood on your neck.

590
00:59:43.248 --> 00:59:44.885
I don't want to talk about it.
So...

591
00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:46.866
What are we gonna invent?

592
00:59:51.308 --> 00:59:52.789
And what if you could
go back in time

593
00:59:52.814 --> 00:59:55.711
and take all those hours
of pain and darkness

594
00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:58.378
and replace them
with something better?

595
00:59:58.482 --> 01:00:02.632
- Like images, or what?
- Yeah, like a Hawaiian sunset or...

596
01:00:02.736 --> 01:00:05.338
or the Grand Canyon. Just
things that remind you

597
01:00:05.363 --> 01:00:06.451
of how beautiful the world...

598
01:00:06.532 --> 01:00:09.180
You know, we've been going
together for like two weeks.

599
01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:11.828
Yeah?

600
01:00:14.164 --> 01:00:15.853
Well, I... I...

601
01:00:18.231 --> 01:00:20.128
You want to kiss me?

602
01:00:28.387 --> 01:00:30.701
- I'm sorry, I...
- Donnie, wait. I just...

603
01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:33.058
- Well, I like you a lot.
- I just want it to be...

604
01:00:33.402 --> 01:00:36.707
at a time when... it...

605
01:00:36.874 --> 01:00:38.063
When what?

606
01:00:38.897 --> 01:00:40.774
When it reminds me just...

607
01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:44.840
When it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be?

608
01:00:46.238 --> 01:00:47.447
Yeah.

609
01:00:49.115 --> 01:00:52.348
And right now there's some fat
guy over there, staring at us.

610
01:01:21.356 --> 01:01:27.132
I don't think telling any woman
to forcibly insert an object up her anus

611
01:01:27.237 --> 01:01:30.552
is something that should
go without consequence.

612
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.454
I think we should
buy him a moped.

613
01:01:39.415 --> 01:01:41.668
I think we should get a divorce.

614
01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:57.412
- You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
- Why would I tell Mom?

615
01:01:57.412 --> 01:02:00.019
- Because you tell Mom everything.
- No, I don't.

616
01:02:04.211 --> 01:02:05.545
Let me see it.

617
01:02:06.067 --> 01:02:07.923
No, it's not finished. It's...

618
01:02:08.131 --> 01:02:09.862
It's ok. It's cool.

619
01:02:15.973 --> 01:02:17.537
That's scary.

620
01:02:20.873 --> 01:02:22.208
You think?

621
01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:27.484
Thank you for seeing us
at such late notice.

622
01:02:27.588 --> 01:02:32.239
We've... we both felt that it was time
for us to come and... and discuss...

623
01:02:32.343 --> 01:02:34.679
What I think is going
on with your son.

624
01:02:34.783 --> 01:02:36.034
Yes.

625
01:02:39.016 --> 01:02:40.497
Well, he's...

626
01:02:42.457 --> 01:02:46.044
Ah... you know about his past,
and he was suspended from school

627
01:02:46.148 --> 01:02:48.192
for insulting his gym teacher.

628
01:02:48.338 --> 01:02:50.277
I'm not really sure
that's a good example, Rose.

629
01:02:50.382 --> 01:02:52.842
I think he had just
cause to insult her.

630
01:02:52.947 --> 01:02:57.097
Rose, let me just lay
out what I believe is happening here.

631
01:03:00.079 --> 01:03:02.998
Donnie's aggressive behaviour,

632
01:03:04.562 --> 01:03:08.587
his increased detachment
from reality,

633
01:03:08.691 --> 01:03:13.530
seem to stem from his inability
to cope with the forces in the world

634
01:03:13.634 --> 01:03:16.095
that he perceives
to be threatening.

635
01:03:21.892 --> 01:03:24.123
Has he ever told you
about his friend Frank?

636
01:03:29.108 --> 01:03:30.359
Frank?

637
01:03:30.713 --> 01:03:33.132
Yes, the giant bunny rabbit.

638
01:03:34.968 --> 01:03:36.094
The what?

639
01:03:40.264 --> 01:03:45.311
I don't recall him ever
having mentioned a rabbit.

640
01:03:45.415 --> 01:03:50.108
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly
called a daylight hallucination.

641
01:04:04.184 --> 01:04:07.917
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

642
01:04:10.273 --> 01:04:11.608
What can we do?

643
01:04:11.921 --> 01:04:13.902
I would like to, um...

644
01:04:14.423 --> 01:04:16.509
do more hypnotherapy...

645
01:04:18.636 --> 01:04:20.784
and increase his medication.

646
01:04:27.582 --> 01:04:31.127
Whatever will help
him, really, is...

647
01:04:31.545 --> 01:04:33.150
That's why we're here.

648
01:04:33.255 --> 01:04:38.260
We just would like him
to experience some relief.

649
01:04:38.989 --> 01:04:43.202
So if you think that more
medication will do that,

650
01:04:43.974 --> 01:04:48.082
then I think we should
give it a try.

651
01:04:52.524 --> 01:04:54.234
Well, what is it like?

652
01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:57.591
It's complicated.

653
01:04:58.217 --> 01:04:59.510
Yeah?

654
01:05:00.135 --> 01:05:01.168
There's like a force, you know,

655
01:05:01.193 --> 01:05:03.668
in your brain, that just
sends you someplace.

656
01:05:04.974 --> 01:05:07.413
Do you go someplace familiar?

657
01:05:08.248 --> 01:05:09.770
No, but I...

658
01:05:10.083 --> 01:05:13.628
Actually, each time I keep waking
up farther and farther from my house.

659
01:05:14.733 --> 01:05:16.360
Scary.

660
01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:30.520
Donnie Darko.

661
01:05:34.336 --> 01:05:35.837
I know.

662
01:05:44.992 --> 01:05:47.599
- Good morning, you mongrels!
- Good morning.

663
01:05:47.954 --> 01:05:51.228
Does that all the guster you can muster?
I said, good morning!

664
01:05:51.332 --> 01:05:55.753
- Good morning!
- Now, that's a tiny, tiny bit better.

665
01:05:55.857 --> 01:05:58.047
But I can still sense
some students out there

666
01:05:58.151 --> 01:06:01.154
who are actually afraid
to say "good morning!"

667
01:06:01.259 --> 01:06:02.697
Good morning!

668
01:06:02.802 --> 01:06:05.033
Yeah,
that's what I like to hear!

669
01:06:05.242 --> 01:06:08.766
Because entirely too
many young men and women today

670
01:06:09.079 --> 01:06:11.957
are completely paralyzed
by their fears.

671
01:06:12.749 --> 01:06:16.899
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction

672
01:06:17.003 --> 01:06:20.361
of drugs, alcohol
and premarital sex.

673
01:06:21.258 --> 01:06:24.949
Now, I'm gonna tell you
a little story today.

674
01:06:25.053 --> 01:06:28.410
It's a heartbreakingly sad
story about a young man

675
01:06:28.869 --> 01:06:33.561
whose life was completely destroyed
by these instruments of fear,

676
01:06:33.666 --> 01:06:39.077
a young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.

677
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:41.726
His name was Frank.

678
01:06:52.528 --> 01:06:55.969
- We're moving through time.
- What?

679
01:06:58.451 --> 01:07:02.955
Hi, um... My stepsister, like, I sometimes
worry that she eats too much.

680
01:07:03.164 --> 01:07:05.374
- Shut up, Kim!
- I'm just trying to help you.

681
01:07:05.479 --> 01:07:07.385
Oh, sweetheart,
sweetheart, please,

682
01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:10.216
there's absolutely no reason
to be embarrassed here.

683
01:07:10.296 --> 01:07:16.239
Many times we eat because we're afraid
to face our ego reflection. Alright?

684
01:07:16.698 --> 01:07:21.995
We find ourselves looking at the mirror,
rather than into and through the mirror.

685
01:07:22.516 --> 01:07:27.521
When we do that, we can finally see
the reality of how beautiful we are.

686
01:07:27.959 --> 01:07:31.212
- Thanks!
- Sure. Come up here. Don't be afraid.

687
01:07:37.135 --> 01:07:40.764
Ah... How can I find
out what I wanna be when I grow up?

688
01:07:40.868 --> 01:07:44.611
Oh! That's a hard one. Well,
what I need you to do...

689
01:07:44.715 --> 01:07:48.604
is look deep inside of yourself,
deep within your heart,

690
01:07:48.709 --> 01:07:51.451
and find what it is in the world
that makes you feel love,

691
01:07:51.555 --> 01:07:55.090
pure, unconditional
love, and go to that.

692
01:07:55.195 --> 01:08:00.116
In your studies, in your athletics,
in your relationships, go towards love.

693
01:08:00.366 --> 01:08:02.024
- Thank you.
- Come on up.

694
01:08:02.128 --> 01:08:02.963
Ok.

695
01:08:06.122 --> 01:08:07.498
Next.

696
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:14.224
What do I do to learn
how to fight?

697
01:08:14.849 --> 01:08:16.883
"What do I do to learn
how to fight..."

698
01:08:16.987 --> 01:08:20.793
Son, violence
is the product of fear.

699
01:08:21.314 --> 01:08:23.389
Learn to truly love yourself,

700
01:08:23.806 --> 01:08:27.497
truly love yourself,
and the world will be yours.

701
01:08:27.956 --> 01:08:30.083
- Ok.
- Get yourself up here!

702
01:08:31.105 --> 01:08:32.753
All right!

703
01:08:36.173 --> 01:08:38.571
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

704
01:08:39.926 --> 01:08:41.908
How much are they paying
you to be here?

705
01:08:43.513 --> 01:08:45.369
Ah... Excuse me?

706
01:08:47.371 --> 01:08:48.737
What is your name, son?

707
01:08:49.154 --> 01:08:50.510
Gerald.

708
01:08:50.791 --> 01:08:53.440
Well, Gerald, I think
you're afraid.

709
01:08:53.544 --> 01:08:55.515
Are you telling us this stuff
so we can buy your book?

710
01:08:55.551 --> 01:08:57.240
Because I gotta tell
you, if you are,

711
01:08:57.265 --> 01:08:59.397
that was some of the worst
advice I ever heard.

712
01:08:59.863 --> 01:09:02.501
- Do you see how sad this is?
- You want your sister to lose weight?

713
01:09:02.605 --> 01:09:04.755
Tell her to get off the couch,
stop eating Twinkies,

714
01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:07.029
and maybe go
out for field hockey.

715
01:09:07.115 --> 01:09:10.373
You know what, no one ever knows
what they want to be when they grow up.

716
01:09:10.478 --> 01:09:14.075
You know, it takes a little while to find
that out. Right, Jim?

717
01:09:14.377 --> 01:09:15.900
And you...

718
01:09:16.525 --> 01:09:17.922
Yeah, you.

719
01:09:18.757 --> 01:09:21.582
Sick of some jerk shoving your head
down the toilet? Well, you know what?

720
01:09:21.687 --> 01:09:25.023
Maybe, you should lift some weights, or...
take a karate lesson,

721
01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:28.047
and the next time he tries to do
it, you kick him in the balls.

722
01:09:30.185 --> 01:09:32.780
Son... Do you see this?

723
01:09:32.885 --> 01:09:35.210
This is an anger prisoner,
a textbook example.

724
01:09:35.315 --> 01:09:38.568
- An anger prisoner...
- Do you see the fear, people?

725
01:09:38.714 --> 01:09:44.511
This boy is scared to death of the truth.
Son, it breaks my heart to say this,

726
01:09:44.824 --> 01:09:48.661
but I believe you are a very
troubled and confused young man.

727
01:09:48.766 --> 01:09:52.050
I believe you are searching
for the answers in all the wrong places.

728
01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:53.906
You're right, actually.
I am pretty...

729
01:09:53.979 --> 01:09:56.607
I'm pretty troubled and I'm
pretty confused. But I...

730
01:09:57.128 --> 01:10:01.153
And I'm afraid, really, really afraid.
Really afraid, but I... I...

731
01:10:01.257 --> 01:10:03.614
I think you're
the fucking Antichrist.

732
01:10:16.689 --> 01:10:19.504
This is amazing, you know. The man
thinks he's telling the truth.

733
01:10:19.609 --> 01:10:22.341
And everything he says
is just a fucking lie.

734
01:10:22.862 --> 01:10:24.447
Everything he says!

735
01:10:25.281 --> 01:10:28.211
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a fucking chud...

736
01:10:28.315 --> 01:10:29.493
Everything he does...
They're just gonna...

737
01:10:29.598 --> 01:10:31.266
Are you ok?

738
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:35.390
Yeah...

739
01:10:35.406 --> 01:10:37.606
Sit down. Calm down.

740
01:10:43.487 --> 01:10:45.322
You ever hear of Grandma Death?

741
01:10:46.802 --> 01:10:48.220
Who?

742
01:10:53.392 --> 01:10:55.509
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".

743
01:10:55.947 --> 01:10:57.354
What is this?

744
01:10:58.126 --> 01:10:59.544
She wrote it.

745
01:11:08.741 --> 01:11:09.992
I'm...

746
01:11:10.993 --> 01:11:12.953
I've been seeing stuff...

747
01:11:13.454 --> 01:11:15.769
Like a lot of really
messed-up stuff.

748
01:11:16.488 --> 01:11:17.878
And there's... There're
chapters in that book

749
01:11:17.903 --> 01:11:19.171
that describe the stuff
I've been seeing,

750
01:11:19.251 --> 01:11:21.180
and it can't just
be a coincidence.

751
01:11:33.745 --> 01:11:36.456
She gotta be in here, somewhere.
She never leaves this house.

752
01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.385
Well, maybe she's asleep.

753
01:11:59.103 --> 01:12:00.917
Donnie, look.

754
01:12:11.073 --> 01:12:13.159
<i>Send her a letter.</i>

755
01:12:41.103 --> 01:12:45.503
<i>Well, each vessel travels
along a vector through space-time,</i>

756
01:12:45.608 --> 01:12:47.318
<i>along its center of gravity.</i>

757
01:12:47.422 --> 01:12:49.007
Like a spear.

758
01:12:50.779 --> 01:12:54.710
- I beg your pardon?
- Like a spear that comes out of your chest.

759
01:12:56.347 --> 01:12:57.828
Sure. Yeah.

760
01:12:58.037 --> 01:13:00.602
And in order for the vessel
to travel through time,

761
01:13:00.706 --> 01:13:03.730
it's got to find a portal,
or in this case a wormhole, or...

762
01:13:03.834 --> 01:13:05.826
Well, could these portals...

763
01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:09.861
Could these portals just appear...
anywhere, any time?

764
01:13:09.965 --> 01:13:11.905
I think that's highly unlikely.

765
01:13:12.009 --> 01:13:14.522
No, I think what you're
talking about is...

766
01:13:14.751 --> 01:13:15.940
an act of God.

767
01:13:16.044 --> 01:13:18.547
Well, if God controls time
then all time is pre-decided.

768
01:13:20.309 --> 01:13:21.769
I'm not following you.

769
01:13:21.873 --> 01:13:24.636
Every living thing follows
along a set path.

770
01:13:25.063 --> 01:13:29.328
And, if you could see your path or channel,
then you could see into the future, right?

771
01:13:29.432 --> 01:13:32.665
Like... That's a form
of time travel.

772
01:13:32.978 --> 01:13:35.772
Well, you're contradicting
yourself, Donnie.

773
01:13:35.876 --> 01:13:40.621
If we were able to see our destinies
manifest themselves visually,

774
01:13:40.725 --> 01:13:44.760
then we would be given a choice
to betray our chosen destinies.

775
01:13:44.864 --> 01:13:50.078
And the mere fact that this choice exists
would make all preformed destiny...

776
01:13:50.443 --> 01:13:53.623
- ...come to an end.
- Not if you travel within God's channel.

777
01:13:58.075 --> 01:14:02.277
I'm... not going to be able
to continue this conversation.

778
01:14:04.498 --> 01:14:06.970
- Why?
- I could lose my job.

779
01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:10.525
Ok.

780
01:14:18.825 --> 01:14:21.421
It gives me no pleasure to deny
you of the right to read

781
01:14:21.526 --> 01:14:25.217
one of the great writers
of the 20th century, but...

782
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:30.775
Alas, I have not yet been elected queen
of the universe, so I must obey the rules,

783
01:14:30.879 --> 01:14:33.037
and so will you.

784
01:14:33.548 --> 01:14:39.346
So, anyone seen in this school
reading this book will be suspended.

785
01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:41.024
But not to worry.

786
01:14:41.129 --> 01:14:45.967
Someone has already pre-ordered a dozen
copies at the Sarasota Mall bookstore.

787
01:14:47.979 --> 01:14:51.806
In Mr. Greene's absence, we will now
be reading another classic,

788
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:54.413
"Watership Down"
by Richard Adams.

789
01:14:58.573 --> 01:15:00.095
Here, Donnie.

790
01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:02.660
Pass these back.

791
01:15:04.329 --> 01:15:07.238
Maybe you and Frank can
read this one together.

792
01:16:20.279 --> 01:16:22.521
<i>Now you know where he lives.</i>

793
01:16:24.721 --> 01:16:29.298
And they grow out of our...
chest, solar plexus?

794
01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:32.385
Just like she described in the book,
the way they moved and they smelled.

795
01:16:32.489 --> 01:16:35.450
It's like...
like they're workers.

796
01:16:36.962 --> 01:16:41.602
Assigned to each one of us. They just...
They're like liquid.

797
01:16:44.261 --> 01:16:47.848
I followed it. Into
my parents' bedroom.

798
01:16:48.682 --> 01:16:50.361
What did you find?

799
01:16:55.355 --> 01:16:56.982
Nothing.

800
01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.801
So we call them IMGs.

801
01:17:03.906 --> 01:17:05.897
Infant Memory Generators.

802
01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:08.654
Yeah. So, the idea is that you buy
these glasses for your infant,

803
01:17:08.759 --> 01:17:11.111
and they wear them
at night when they sleep.

804
01:17:12.435 --> 01:17:17.492
But inside the glasses are these slide
photographs, and each photograph is of...

805
01:17:17.596 --> 01:17:21.444
something peaceful or beautiful,
whatever the parents want to put inside.

806
01:17:21.757 --> 01:17:24.655
And what effect do you think
that this would have on an infant?

807
01:17:25.427 --> 01:17:28.305
Well... this thing is, nobody
remembers their infancy.

808
01:17:28.409 --> 01:17:30.818
And anyone who says
they do is lying, so...

809
01:17:30.974 --> 01:17:33.643
We think this will help develop
memory earlier in life.

810
01:17:33.748 --> 01:17:34.707
Yeah.

811
01:17:34.811 --> 01:17:37.647
And did you stop and think
that maybe infants need darkness?

812
01:17:37.752 --> 01:17:41.245
That maybe darkness is part
of their natural development?

813
01:17:45.092 --> 01:17:46.364
No.

814
01:17:49.263 --> 01:17:50.494
Yeah.

815
01:17:50.911 --> 01:17:55.936
What if the parents, like, put in pictures
of Satan or dead people, crap like that?

816
01:17:56.187 --> 01:17:58.001
Is that what you'd show
your kids?

817
01:18:00.086 --> 01:18:04.945
Well, I mean, didn't your dad,
like, stab your mom?

818
01:18:14.225 --> 01:18:15.643
Get out.

819
01:18:17.583 --> 01:18:18.959
Gretchen!

820
01:18:19.168 --> 01:18:23.255
Gretchen! Gretchen. I'm
sorry about those guys...

821
01:18:51.106 --> 01:18:54.307
- Two for "Evil Dead", please.
- That'll be two dollars.

822
01:19:42.313 --> 01:19:45.316
Why do you wear
that stupid bunny suit?

823
01:19:50.592 --> 01:19:53.303
<i>Why are you wearing
that stupid man suit?</i>

824
01:20:03.167 --> 01:20:04.668
Take it off.

825
01:20:25.230 --> 01:20:27.775
What happened to your eye?

826
01:20:43.415 --> 01:20:45.146
Why do they call you Frank?

827
01:20:46.710 --> 01:20:48.691
It is the name of my father.

828
01:20:51.757 --> 01:20:53.759
And his father before me.

829
01:20:58.138 --> 01:20:59.598
Frank...

830
01:21:03.623 --> 01:21:05.354
When is this gonna stop?

831
01:21:06.292 --> 01:21:08.336
You should already know that.

832
01:21:11.589 --> 01:21:13.862
I want you to watch
the movie screen.

833
01:21:16.031 --> 01:21:18.127
There's something
I want to show you.

834
01:21:27.042 --> 01:21:29.085
Have you ever seen a portal?

835
01:21:50.294 --> 01:21:52.275
Burn it to the ground.

836
01:23:06.933 --> 01:23:10.415
Ok. Now, girls, I want
you to concentrate.

837
01:23:10.519 --> 01:23:12.688
Failure is not an option.

838
01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:18.423
And, Bethany, if you feel the need
to vomit up there... just swallow it.

839
01:23:18.527 --> 01:23:19.935
Ok, Mom.

840
01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:22.834
Hey guys, good luck out there.

841
01:24:02.175 --> 01:24:04.093
Now, that was really something.

842
01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:07.034
Thank you, Cherita Chen,
with "Autumn Angel".

843
01:24:07.868 --> 01:24:10.516
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for is here.

844
01:24:10.621 --> 01:24:13.874
It is my very distinct pleasure
to introduce to you...

845
01:24:13.978 --> 01:24:19.859
Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey, Samantha
Darko, Beth Farmer and Joanie James.

846
01:24:19.963 --> 01:24:22.466
They are Sparkle Motion.

847
01:27:15.262 --> 01:27:17.233
How long was I asleep for?

848
01:27:18.036 --> 01:27:19.423
Whole movie.

849
01:28:02.559 --> 01:28:05.437
Well, look what the cat
dragged in!

850
01:28:08.565 --> 01:28:10.306
How you doing, Donnie?

851
01:28:16.969 --> 01:28:22.412
Your little sister was broken-hearted
that you missed her big show last night.

852
01:28:24.289 --> 01:28:25.499
Dad?

853
01:28:27.146 --> 01:28:28.564
I'm crazy.

854
01:28:29.836 --> 01:28:31.463
You're not crazy.

855
01:28:33.423 --> 01:28:35.237
I used to be crazy.

856
01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.576
But you're not crazy.

857
01:28:42.265 --> 01:28:46.123
- Look, you're my only son...
- I know...

858
01:28:46.227 --> 01:28:52.505
No, now hold it. I know I'm not
the best communicator, but...

859
01:28:55.070 --> 01:29:00.971
Whatever happens to you,
be honest, tell the truth,

860
01:29:01.805 --> 01:29:04.662
even if they do look
at you funny, they will.

861
01:29:05.351 --> 01:29:07.791
But what you gotta
understand, son,

862
01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:12.587
is that almost all of those
people are full of shit.

863
01:29:18.238 --> 01:29:21.168
They're all part of this
great big conspiracy...

864
01:29:21.481 --> 01:29:23.348
of bullshit.

865
01:29:24.599 --> 01:29:26.914
And they're scared
of people like you.

866
01:29:29.103 --> 01:29:32.357
Because those bullshitters know
that you're smarter than all of them.

867
01:29:35.506 --> 01:29:37.789
You know what you say
to people like that?

868
01:29:41.803 --> 01:29:43.315
"Fuck you".

869
01:29:47.872 --> 01:29:51.970
<i>The blaze was extinguished sometime
after 8 o'clock last night.</i>

870
01:29:52.074 --> 01:29:58.195
<i>Now firefighters discovered what has
been referred to as a kiddie porn dungeon.</i>

871
01:29:58.299 --> 01:30:00.532
<i>Cunningham, who has
become a recent celebrity</i>

872
01:30:00.557 --> 01:30:02.400
<i>for his books
and motivational tapes,</i>

873
01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.284
<i>-... was arrested earlier this morning,</i>
-Oh, my God!

874
01:30:04.388 --> 01:30:07.610
<i>while golfing at the Sarasota
Heights Country Club.</i>

875
01:30:08.517 --> 01:30:12.255
<i>Arson has not been ruled out as part
of the cause of the fire.</i>

876
01:30:12.334 --> 01:30:12.952
Oh, my God.

877
01:30:12.977 --> 01:30:14.829
<i>Now a group of Cunning
Vision employees...</i>

878
01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:17.391
- Dad played golf with that guy.
- ... lead by self-proclaimed fear survivor...

879
01:30:17.495 --> 01:30:20.696
<i>Linda Connie, vehemently
denied of the alleged link to</i>

880
01:30:20.801 --> 01:30:23.678
<i>a child pornography
publishing circuit.</i>

881
01:30:23.783 --> 01:30:28.204
<i>In a vicious statement, Connie attacked
the Middlesex fire department officials,</i>

882
01:30:28.412 --> 01:30:30.873
<i>claiming a vast conspiracy.</i>

883
01:30:33.250 --> 01:30:37.213
I'm sorry, Karen. This
is a progressive school,

884
01:30:37.317 --> 01:30:41.509
but we don't feel the methods
you've undertaken here are appropriate.

885
01:30:41.863 --> 01:30:45.033
What exactly about my methods
are inappropriate?

886
01:30:51.602 --> 01:30:55.606
I am sorry that you have failed.

887
01:30:58.817 --> 01:31:01.654
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have another appointment.

888
01:31:03.676 --> 01:31:05.741
You can finish out the week.

889
01:31:12.143 --> 01:31:15.271
Fuck!

890
01:31:37.387 --> 01:31:40.849
Good afternoon. It gives me
great pleasure to announce

891
01:31:40.953 --> 01:31:43.612
that the Middlesex Ridge
School dance team

892
01:31:43.716 --> 01:31:47.903
has been invited to perform on Ed
McMahon's "Star Search '88"

893
01:31:47.928 --> 01:31:50.717
in Los Angeles,
California.

894
01:32:16.144 --> 01:32:20.753
<i>- I know now, a terrible thing is coming.
- What do you mean?</i>

895
01:32:23.234 --> 01:32:27.822
<i>The field, the field.
It's covered with blood.</i>

896
01:32:28.365 --> 01:32:31.534
<i>Blood? Don't be silly.</i>

897
01:32:43.671 --> 01:32:45.809
<i>All right, all right, Fiver.</i>

898
01:32:45.913 --> 01:32:48.489
<i>It's getting dark. I think
we should get back to the burrow.</i>

899
01:32:48.593 --> 01:32:52.149
<i>Back to the burrow? It'll come
there, don't think it won't.</i>

900
01:32:52.618 --> 01:32:55.485
<i>- It's all around us!
- Now, stop it, Fiver.</i>

901
01:32:55.934 --> 01:32:57.644
<i>We've got to go away from here.</i>

902
01:33:05.589 --> 01:33:10.073
When the other rabbits hear
of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?

903
01:33:10.177 --> 01:33:12.012
Why should we care?

904
01:33:13.722 --> 01:33:16.245
Because the rabbits
are us, Donnie.

905
01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:19.415
Why should I mourn for a rabbit
like it was human?

906
01:33:20.187 --> 01:33:23.544
Are you saying that the death
of one species is less tragic than another?

907
01:33:23.649 --> 01:33:25.098
Of course.

908
01:33:25.619 --> 01:33:27.027
A rabbit's not like us.

909
01:33:27.131 --> 01:33:29.154
You know, it has no history
books, no photographs,

910
01:33:29.258 --> 01:33:31.990
no knowledge
of sorrow or regret.

911
01:33:32.512 --> 01:33:34.962
I mean... I'm sorry, Ms. Pomeroy.
I mean, don't get me wrong,

912
01:33:35.066 --> 01:33:37.725
you know, I like rabbits and all,
they're cute and they're horny.

913
01:33:37.829 --> 01:33:39.800
And if you're cute and you're
horny then you're probably happy

914
01:33:39.904 --> 01:33:42.584
that you don't know who you
are or why you're even alive.

915
01:33:42.688 --> 01:33:46.578
You just want to have sex as many times
as possible before you die.

916
01:33:47.652 --> 01:33:51.478
But I just don't see the point
in crying over a dead rabbit...

917
01:33:52.111 --> 01:33:55.332
you know, who... never even feared
death to begin with.

918
01:33:56.911 --> 01:33:57.682
You're wrong.

919
01:33:57.787 --> 01:34:01.926
These rabbits can talk, they're the product
of the author's imagination, and...

920
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:07.359
He cares for them, so we care for them,
otherwise we've just missed the point.

921
01:34:10.445 --> 01:34:13.949
But aren't we forgetting
about the miracle of storytelling?

922
01:34:15.638 --> 01:34:19.579
The dea ex machina?
The god machine?

923
01:34:21.195 --> 01:34:23.333
That's what saved the rabbits.

924
01:34:30.361 --> 01:34:33.739
No, it was ridiculous.
I'll call you back.

925
01:34:35.407 --> 01:34:38.035
- Rose.
- Kitty.

926
01:34:39.286 --> 01:34:41.810
Rose, I'm sure that you're
aware of the horrible

927
01:34:41.835 --> 01:34:43.689
allegations against Jim
Cunningham.

928
01:34:43.770 --> 01:34:46.898
I know, I saw it on TV. Something
about a kiddie porn dungeon...

929
01:34:47.002 --> 01:34:50.214
Oh, please, please!
Don't use those words!

930
01:34:51.256 --> 01:34:55.709
It's obviously some kind of conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man.

931
01:34:55.907 --> 01:34:58.493
And I have taken it
upon myself to spearhead

932
01:34:58.518 --> 01:35:00.644
the Jim Cunningham
defence campaign.

933
01:35:02.434 --> 01:35:06.751
Rose, I have to appear
at his arraignment tomorrow morning.

934
01:35:06.855 --> 01:35:10.442
And as you know, the girls are scheduled
to leave for Los Angeles in the morning.

935
01:35:10.901 --> 01:35:13.254
Now, as their coach,
I was the obvious choice

936
01:35:13.279 --> 01:35:15.325
to chaperone them
on their trip, but...

937
01:35:15.405 --> 01:35:19.430
- But now you can't go.
- Yes.

938
01:35:20.202 --> 01:35:24.602
Now, believe me, of all the other mothers,
I would never dream of asking you.

939
01:35:24.706 --> 01:35:27.584
But none of the other mothers
are available to go.

940
01:35:30.587 --> 01:35:35.592
I don't know, Kitty. It's a bad weekend.
Eddie's in New York.

941
01:35:36.176 --> 01:35:40.127
Rose, I don't know
if you realize

942
01:35:40.152 --> 01:35:43.707
what an opportunity this
is for our daughters!

943
01:35:43.788 --> 01:35:45.889
This has been a dream
of Samantha's

944
01:35:45.914 --> 01:35:49.401
and all of ours
for a long time.

945
01:35:49.481 --> 01:35:52.630
I made her lead dancer!

946
01:35:53.297 --> 01:35:57.739
Sometimes I doubt your commitment
to Sparkle Motion!

947
01:36:28.061 --> 01:36:30.209
Elizabeth will be in charge.

948
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:33.024
She'll drive you to therapy.

949
01:36:34.067 --> 01:36:38.842
And if you need anything, you promise
me that you will call Dr. Thurman?

950
01:36:49.311 --> 01:36:51.970
How does it feel to have
a wacko for a son?

951
01:36:58.007 --> 01:36:59.988
It feels wonderful.

952
01:37:32.604 --> 01:37:35.565
Here... I'm Sorry! Here you are!

953
01:37:36.962 --> 01:37:40.153
- You guys are gonna win. I know it.
- So do I.

954
01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:43.021
Here's the keys to the Taurus.
There's ton of food in the fridge

955
01:37:43.125 --> 01:37:45.221
and I left money on the kitchen
table, but please do not put...

956
01:37:45.325 --> 01:37:47.932
Hey. Mom, go. You're
gonna miss your plane.

957
01:37:48.244 --> 01:37:51.247
Mom, I need... I'm just...

958
01:37:52.269 --> 01:37:54.323
There's nothing
broken in my brain.

959
01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:58.192
- I know.
- Bye, Donnie.

960
01:38:03.384 --> 01:38:06.659
Ok, go. Go!

961
01:38:29.181 --> 01:38:30.808
Hello, Donnie.

962
01:38:31.433 --> 01:38:36.271
It's Friday. Shouldn't you be
off with your friends, scaring old people?

963
01:38:41.297 --> 01:38:43.028
What's going on?

964
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:46.041
I don't know.
That's a good question.

965
01:38:47.407 --> 01:38:52.245
Suffice to say I'm no longer
your English teacher. They fired me.

966
01:38:52.809 --> 01:38:54.341
That's bullshit!

967
01:38:55.384 --> 01:38:57.511
You're the only good
teacher here.

968
01:38:59.941 --> 01:39:01.463
Thank you.

969
01:39:03.653 --> 01:39:05.279
What's "Cellar Door"?

970
01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.711
This famous linguist
once said that

971
01:39:10.128 --> 01:39:14.924
of all the phrases in the English
language, of all the endless combinations

972
01:39:15.029 --> 01:39:17.500
of words
in all of history, that...

973
01:39:17.604 --> 01:39:20.482
"Cellar Door"
is the most beautiful.

974
01:39:23.005 --> 01:39:24.632
"Cellar Door".

975
01:39:56.413 --> 01:40:00.542
I promise that one day
everything's gonna be better for you.

976
01:40:02.857 --> 01:40:04.359
Shut up!

977
01:40:18.164 --> 01:40:21.104
<i>- I want to talk about your past today.
- No.</i>

978
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:25.859
<i>I want to talk about you
and your parents.</i>

979
01:40:26.944 --> 01:40:30.781
<i>They didn't buy me
what I wanted for Christmas.</i>

980
01:40:31.427 --> 01:40:33.805
What did you want
for Christmas that year?

981
01:40:35.098 --> 01:40:36.985
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

982
01:40:39.748 --> 01:40:44.357
How did you feel, being denied
these Hungry Hungry Hippos?

983
01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:46.275
Regret.

984
01:40:47.099 --> 01:40:49.184
What else makes you feel regret?

985
01:40:51.781 --> 01:40:53.668
That I did it again.

986
01:40:54.836 --> 01:40:56.483
You did it again?

987
01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:01.770
I flooded my school and I burned
down that pervert's house.

988
01:41:04.794 --> 01:41:07.880
I only have a few days
left before they catch me.

989
01:41:08.130 --> 01:41:13.219
- Did Frank tell you to do these things?
- I have to obey him. He saved my life.

990
01:41:14.887 --> 01:41:19.433
I have to obey him or I'll be
left all alone. And then...

991
01:41:20.883 --> 01:41:23.959
And then I won't be able to figure
out what this is all about.

992
01:41:25.314 --> 01:41:28.181
I won't be able to...
know his master plan.

993
01:41:29.276 --> 01:41:32.029
Do you mean God's master plan?

994
01:41:33.301 --> 01:41:35.720
Do you now believe in God?

995
01:41:35.866 --> 01:41:37.983
I have the power
to build a time machine.

996
01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:41.215
How is that possible?

997
01:41:44.031 --> 01:41:47.690
How is time travel
possible, Donnie?

998
01:41:47.795 --> 01:41:49.943
Time's up, Frank said.

999
01:41:50.923 --> 01:41:53.884
- When is this going to happen?
- Soon.

1000
01:42:14.842 --> 01:42:16.876
What is going to happen?

1001
01:42:20.869 --> 01:42:24.831
- Frank is gonna kill.
- Who is he going to kill?

1002
01:42:29.211 --> 01:42:31.244
Who is he going to kill, Donnie?

1003
01:42:31.348 --> 01:42:32.391
I can see him right now!

1004
01:42:37.552 --> 01:42:39.283
The sky's gonna open up.

1005
01:42:46.353 --> 01:42:49.262
If the sky were
to suddenly open up,

1006
01:42:49.366 --> 01:42:52.880
there would be no law,
there would be no rule.

1007
01:42:52.984 --> 01:42:56.342
There would only be you
and your memories.

1008
01:42:56.967 --> 01:43:01.117
The choices you've made
and the people you've touched.

1009
01:43:02.118 --> 01:43:07.999
If this world were to end, there
would only be you and him...

1010
01:43:09.209 --> 01:43:10.888
and no one else.

1011
01:43:41.074 --> 01:43:42.951
You can stop taking
your medication.

1012
01:43:43.055 --> 01:43:46.861
They're placebos. Just
pills made out of water.

1013
01:43:49.958 --> 01:43:51.344
Thank you.

1014
01:43:52.314 --> 01:43:53.753
Donnie...

1015
01:43:56.047 --> 01:44:00.927
An atheist is someone who denies
altogether the existence of God.

1016
01:44:01.031 --> 01:44:02.814
You're an agnostic.

1017
01:44:03.867 --> 01:44:05.629
An agnostic is someone...

1018
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:11.229
who believes that there can be no
proof of the existence of God,

1019
01:44:11.333 --> 01:44:16.630
but does not deny a possibility
that God exists.

1020
01:44:23.762 --> 01:44:25.545
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.

1021
01:44:49.058 --> 01:44:50.476
Hey.

1022
01:44:51.519 --> 01:44:53.354
I got in.

1023
01:44:57.608 --> 01:44:59.339
I'm going to Harvard.

1024
01:45:01.591 --> 01:45:05.574
Hey, we should totally throw a party.
I mean, Mom and Dad are gone, and...

1025
01:45:05.991 --> 01:45:08.504
It's Halloween Carnival. We
could totally get away with it.

1026
01:45:08.609 --> 01:45:12.049
Ok. But it has to be
small, alright?

1027
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:48.388
We got eggs, water balloons
and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.

1028
01:45:48.492 --> 01:45:50.734
I stole four beers from my dad.

1029
01:45:51.099 --> 01:45:54.289
- Well, we got a keg.
- Keg beer is for pussies.

1030
01:46:17.124 --> 01:46:19.710
<i>Rose, this is Lilian Thurman.</i>

1031
01:46:19.815 --> 01:46:25.362
It is extremely important that you call me
as soon as you get this message. Thank you.

1032
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:45.641
Hey.

1033
01:46:50.376 --> 01:46:51.930
You ok?

1034
01:46:53.890 --> 01:46:55.788
Yeah. My mom's gone.

1035
01:46:57.873 --> 01:46:59.396
You want to come in?

1036
01:47:23.378 --> 01:47:24.994
I don't know. She...

1037
01:47:25.327 --> 01:47:29.999
She didn't leave a note and...
the house was all messed up.

1038
01:47:31.177 --> 01:47:32.804
But you're ok.

1039
01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:37.913
Did you call the cops?

1040
01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:44.273
Yeah, they said I should leave the house
and that I should go to a safe place.

1041
01:47:46.567 --> 01:47:51.531
I'm just so scared. I keep thinking
something awful was happening and...

1042
01:47:53.199 --> 01:47:56.410
It's my fucking
stepdad, I know it.

1043
01:48:05.711 --> 01:48:07.953
I guess some people are just...

1044
01:48:08.214 --> 01:48:10.560
born with tragedy
in their blood.

1045
01:48:14.512 --> 01:48:16.420
Hey, have you guys seen Frank?

1046
01:48:16.524 --> 01:48:18.797
No, I think they said they were
going on a beer run.

1047
01:48:22.061 --> 01:48:24.011
<i>If you're there, please pick up.</i>

1048
01:48:24.219 --> 01:48:25.940
<i>Oh, well. Good news.</i>

1049
01:48:26.044 --> 01:48:28.015
<i>The girls, they got
three and a half stars</i>

1050
01:48:28.119 --> 01:48:30.402
<i>and they get to come back
for the quarter-finals.</i>

1051
01:48:30.507 --> 01:48:33.697
<i>Samantha was amazing. Anyway...</i>

1052
01:48:34.365 --> 01:48:37.430
We're gonna take the red-eye back
tonight and we are to arrive...

1053
01:48:37.535 --> 01:48:40.120
- Mom, the plane's about to leave.
- Yeah. Ok.

1054
01:48:40.225 --> 01:48:41.796
We'll take the red-eye back
tonight we should arrive

1055
01:48:41.821 --> 01:48:43.344
around 8:30 in the morning.

1056
01:48:45.230 --> 01:48:48.233
I hope everything's... I hope
everything's all right.

1057
01:48:48.337 --> 01:48:50.860
I love you. Bye.

1058
01:50:53.023 --> 01:50:55.526
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

1059
01:50:55.943 --> 01:50:58.779
- Donnie?
- Look, we gotta go.

1060
01:50:59.968 --> 01:51:03.158
- We've got to see Grandma Death.
- But why? Is this about the book?

1061
01:51:03.262 --> 01:51:04.827
- No, it's Frank.
- Donnie...

1062
01:51:04.931 --> 01:51:07.037
Time is running out!
We gotta go.

1063
01:51:53.124 --> 01:51:55.992
Donnie, nobody's here.
Let's just forget about it.

1064
01:51:58.401 --> 01:52:00.058
"Cellar door".

1065
01:52:00.611 --> 01:52:01.967
What?

1066
01:53:04.174 --> 01:53:05.801
Donnie! Donnie!

1067
01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:10.973
Donnie!

1068
01:53:12.328 --> 01:53:14.028
Why the fuck are you here?

1069
01:53:14.132 --> 01:53:16.593
Hey! Oh, my God.

1070
01:53:19.418 --> 01:53:20.941
- You're dead!
- What do we do?

1071
01:53:21.045 --> 01:53:23.370
- Oh, shit.
- Leave them alone!

1072
01:53:27.614 --> 01:53:30.638
Don't fucking move! Don't fucking move!
What did I say?

1073
01:53:39.125 --> 01:53:40.356
There's a car!

1074
01:53:42.170 --> 01:53:44.839
- Get the hell out of here, now!
- Come on!

1075
01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:48.009
Seth, there's a car's coming.
Let's go!

1076
01:53:48.114 --> 01:53:50.689
I have a bigger knife now.

1077
01:53:52.555 --> 01:53:53.682
Fuck!

1078
01:54:00.042 --> 01:54:02.044
Did you call the fucking cops?

1079
01:54:02.878 --> 01:54:05.881
- Dea ex machina.
- What did you just say?

1080
01:54:07.341 --> 01:54:10.803
- What the fuck did you just say?
- Our savior.

1081
01:54:15.307 --> 01:54:16.517
Donnie!

1082
01:54:47.318 --> 01:54:48.653
Frank...

1083
01:55:14.116 --> 01:55:15.596
Is she dead?

1084
01:55:24.313 --> 01:55:26.826
What were you guys doing
in the middle of the road, huh?!

1085
01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:28.494
What were you thinking?

1086
01:55:35.898 --> 01:55:37.357
Go home!

1087
01:55:38.431 --> 01:55:41.226
Go home and tell your parents
that everything's gonna be ok.

1088
01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:44.354
Go!

1089
01:56:12.027 --> 01:56:14.478
A storm is coming.

1090
01:56:15.708 --> 01:56:17.376
You must hurry.

1091
01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:52.582
Going home.

1092
02:00:59.834 --> 02:01:04.453
<i>Dear Roberta Sparrow, I've reached
the end of your book, and...</i>

1093
02:01:04.776 --> 02:01:07.789
<i>there's so many things
that I need to ask you.</i>

1094
02:01:08.738 --> 02:01:11.543
<i>Sometimes I'm afraid
of what you might telling me.</i>

1095
02:01:15.745 --> 02:01:20.093
<i>Sometimes I'm afraid that... you'll tell
me that this is not a work of fiction.</i>

1096
02:01:21.042 --> 02:01:26.037
<i>I can only hope that the answers
will come to me in my sleep.</i>

1097
02:01:26.798 --> 02:01:29.446
<i>I hope that when the world
comes to an end,</i>

1098
02:01:29.759 --> 02:01:31.949
<i>I can breathe a sigh of relief</i>

1099
02:01:32.449 --> 02:01:36.464
<i>because there will be so
much to look forward to.</i>

1100
02:06:22.133 --> 02:06:25.500
Hey. What's going on?

1101
02:06:26.303 --> 02:06:29.150
Horrible accident.
My neighbour...

1102
02:06:30.297 --> 02:06:31.694
he got killed.

1103
02:06:32.476 --> 02:06:36.438
- What happened?
- Got smooshed by a jet engine.

1104
02:06:42.486 --> 02:06:44.154
What was his name?

1105
02:06:44.905 --> 02:06:47.366
Donnie. Donnie Darko.

1106
02:06:49.931 --> 02:06:52.089
I feel bad for his family.

1107
02:06:52.913 --> 02:06:54.331
Yeah.

1108
02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:03.653
Did you know him?

1109
02:07:06.927 --> 02:07:08.241
No.
