Whoa! Hey, did-did you see it, the
way he went sailing right out there?

41
00:07:48.396 --> 00:07:50.666
He just went sailing out there.

42
00:07:50.817 --> 00:07:54.088
It was terrible. I... I mean, just help
him. He must have been doing over 80.

43
00:07:54.118 --> 00:07:56.768
An ambulance... We've better...
We ought to call an ambulance.

44
00:07:58.365 --> 00:08:03.569
Oh, look at that car! He must have gone
by you doing 90 miles an hour.

45
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.129
- He was passing me!
- I never saw such a crazy thing in my life!

46
00:08:07.171 --> 00:08:08.871
- Let's get down there.
- Let's go.

47
00:08:09.442 --> 00:08:13.771
- We're going down there. You stay in the car!
- Russell, be careful. Remember your condition!

48
00:08:15.251 --> 00:08:18.373
Boy, the way he just sailed out there...

49
00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.274
Look out, look out, look out!

50
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:25.977
There's nobody in the car!

51
00:08:26.626 --> 00:08:28.878
- He's right, there is nobody...
- What do you mean "there is nobody"?

52
00:08:28.902 --> 00:08:31.154
- There he is!
- Uh-huh!
- Holy smoke!

53
00:08:37.005 --> 00:08:38.401
Hey, how about that?

54
00:08:38.431 --> 00:08:40.910
This guy is still alive, I tell ya!
He's still alive.

55
00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:43.481
Maybe we ought to call an ambulance
for him, right away?!

56
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:46.982
How he's survived that, poor old lad,
the way he went sailing right out there!

57
00:08:47.012 --> 00:08:50.183
Look, I'm not a doctor, anything...
but I have some medical experience.

58
00:08:50.284 --> 00:08:51.284
I'm a dentist.

59
00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:53.520
Do you think you're hurt... real bad?

60
00:08:56.083 --> 00:08:57.786
Is he kidding?

61
00:08:57.816 --> 00:09:00.062
Now just hold on, mister,
we're gonna get you to a hospital.

62
00:09:00.086 --> 00:09:03.575
You move me... I'll break up
in little pieces.

63
00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:05.876
But what a deal.

64
00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.167
Look, there's this dough, see?

65
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.591
There's all this dough: 350 Gs!

66
00:09:12.621 --> 00:09:14.566
Do you hear what I'm sayin'?

67
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.272
350 Gs!

68
00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:22.790
In the park, in Rosita,
Rosita Beach State Park.

69
00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:26.295
Just south of Dago in Santa Rosita.

70
00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:29.482
It's in this box. Buried under this...

71
00:09:33.113 --> 00:09:35.128
...buried under this Big W.

72
00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:36.388
You'll see it.

73
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:40.548
You'll see it under this...
under this Big W.

74
00:09:40.777 --> 00:09:44.800
You can't miss it, a big... a Big W.

75
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.925
And it's been there...
And it's been laying there for 15 years.

76
00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:52.892
- He's very sick.
- He may die.

77
00:09:52.922 --> 00:09:55.793
Listen. I tell you,
I'm giving it to you!

78
00:09:55.954 --> 00:09:58.794
And don't let them kid you.
Don't let them kid you...

79
00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:03.463
Don't let them give you the business, see,
because it was mine and I paid for it!

80
00:10:03.605 --> 00:10:06.896
Paid for every lousy buck of it,
you hear!

81
00:10:07.103 --> 00:10:10.055
But watch out. Watch out for the bulls!

82
00:10:10.592 --> 00:10:14.298
Lousy, stinking bulls are everywhere!

83
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:16.396
Bulls all over the place.

84
00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:18.804
You just drive down and dig it up.

85
00:10:19.361 --> 00:10:20.441
Dig it all up!

86
00:10:23.983 --> 00:10:27.467
And then... and then you
fix yourselves all up.

87
00:10:28.056 --> 00:10:31.403
Fix yourselves all up.
Walk down the street like a king!

88
00:10:31.604 --> 00:10:34.704
Back to the old neighborhood,
see the fellas...

89
00:10:35.198 --> 00:10:39.758
the dames...
the dames, all with a big hello...

90
00:10:40.584 --> 00:10:42.991
...a big hello for ol' Smiler.

91
00:10:43.896 --> 00:10:45.703
Good old Smiler...

92
00:10:46.948 --> 00:10:50.608
...everybody's friend...

93
00:10:51.293 --> 00:10:53.959
...everybody's...

94
00:10:58.579 --> 00:11:02.276
- Aunt Belle, I didn't mean to do it!
- Holy mackerel! Take it easy, mister.

95
00:11:02.581 --> 00:11:06.669
Please, please say it don't make
any difference, Aunt Belle!

96
00:11:06.786 --> 00:11:09.297
Please! You got to say...

97
00:11:09.465 --> 00:11:13.051
You got to tell me
it don't make any difference!

98
00:11:13.844 --> 00:11:17.972
- For heaven's sake, tell him.
- It... It don't make any difference.

99
00:11:41.137 --> 00:11:43.952
That guy's dead. You'd better believe it.

100
00:11:44.235 --> 00:11:45.375
I believe it, all right.

101
00:11:45.543 --> 00:11:48.575
But if he jumps up again like he did
before, I'm gonna get the hell outta here.

102
00:11:48.599 --> 00:11:52.799
- Boy, what a routine he went through.
- So some- somebody ought to cover him up.

103
00:11:53.676 --> 00:11:56.036
What are you looking at me for, pal?
All I got is this sweater.

104
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.184
Ah, never mind. I got a blanket
up there in the truck.

105
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.131
Tell me something, d'you think
there was anything in all that, I mean,
you know, what he was telling?

106
00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:03.180
He was just raving, man.
He flipped.

107
00:12:03.704 --> 00:12:06.378
Hey. This mu-- this must be the police.

108
00:12:06.677 --> 00:12:09.832
You think we ought to tell them about
what he was talking about? What he was...

109
00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:12.796
We just saying, don't say anything,
'cause they'll ask questions and we'll
be in here all day.

110
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.674
We can't afford to be here all day.
We got to be in Vegas this afternoon.

111
00:12:15.698 --> 00:12:17.652
Oh, I got a van of furniture.
I got to get to Yuma.

112
00:12:17.676 --> 00:12:20.529
My wife and I, we are on our second
honeymoon you know. I know where we...

113
00:12:20.553 --> 00:12:24.604
My wife's up there with her mother.
We're on our way to Lake Mead.

114
00:12:24.634 --> 00:12:27.917
Oh, what's all to argue about? You just
clam up. Say he don't say nothing.

115
00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:29.800
And this way, we get out of here.

116
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:33.704
- Buck, you a police officer?
- Aye.

117
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.266
Yep!!

118
00:12:48.543 --> 00:12:51.272
- How long ago did this happen?
- About... five minutes ago?

119
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:53.584
Um... a few minutes ago,
about five minutes ago, officer.

120
00:12:53.868 --> 00:12:57.055
- Anybody see it? Actually see it happen?
- Well, um...

121
00:12:57.168 --> 00:13:00.539
- He passed me on the curve, you know,
when he met the...
- Did anybody actually see it?

122
00:13:00.563 --> 00:13:03.244
Well, he was passing me
when he... sailed right out there.

123
00:13:03.274 --> 00:13:06.109
- Right over there, up there.
- Who was the first down to him?

124
00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:08.727
Well, we all went down.
[indistinct chatter]

125
00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:10.102
Was he dead?

126
00:13:10.909 --> 00:13:12.075
Was he already dead?

127
00:13:13.915 --> 00:13:16.444
I said, "Was he already dead
when you got down here?!"

128
00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:19.302
Practically.

129
00:13:20.103 --> 00:13:22.486
He was still alive. Did he say anything?

130
00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:28.231
- I said, did he say anything
before he died?
- What about?

131
00:13:28.783 --> 00:13:30.377
What do you mean, "what about?"!

132
00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:33.070
Did he say anything
or didn't he say anything?

133
00:13:34.857 --> 00:13:35.857
Well...

134
00:13:37.862 --> 00:13:38.551
...he... eh...

135
00:13:38.716 --> 00:13:41.342
- He was raving, Officer, that's what...
- Raving? What about raving?

136
00:13:41.366 --> 00:13:44.257
Yeah, well, he said...
what he said was sort of, um...

137
00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:46.086
- ...it was sort of...
- Embarrassing.

138
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.519
What was? What was?
Come on, come on!

139
00:13:49.914 --> 00:13:52.180
He thought that this fellow
was his aunt.

140
00:13:52.682 --> 00:13:54.822
- His aunt?
- Yeah, his-- his Aunt Belle.

141
00:13:54.852 --> 00:13:57.292
Yeah, that's right, he must have had
an aunt named Aunt Belle.

142
00:13:57.424 --> 00:13:58.651
All right!

143
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.110
Did he make any kind of statement?
Any last messages? Anything like that?

144
00:14:03.818 --> 00:14:06.937
He wanted... he wanted this fella
to tell him it didn't make no difference.

145
00:14:07.265 --> 00:14:08.265
What?

146
00:14:08.428 --> 00:14:09.428
Why you?

147
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.122
- 'Cause he thought he was his aunt.
- His Aunt Belle.

148
00:14:12.164 --> 00:14:13.164
That's why.

149
00:14:13.596 --> 00:14:16.489
But was it he wanted you to say
it didn't make any difference?

150
00:14:16.575 --> 00:14:19.833
Officer, he didn't make that clear. At all.
He didn't make it clear.

151
00:14:19.863 --> 00:14:22.441
No, he didn't make anything clear.
Look, officer, can we get going?

152
00:14:22.465 --> 00:14:24.396
Just a minute, just a minute.
Just a minute.

153
00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:27.096
I gotta get your names and where
you can be reached, just in case.

154
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.889
Look, my wife and I, we're on our
second honeymoon.
We don't know where we'll be...

155
00:14:29.913 --> 00:14:32.471
We can't stick around for that, officer,
because we're due in Las Vegas

156
00:14:32.495 --> 00:14:35.258
and we don't know how-- how long...
how long we gonna stay there.

157
00:14:35.288 --> 00:14:38.557
Look, I got this van of furniture,
mister, and I got to get to Yuma
before I get back to my...

158
00:14:38.581 --> 00:14:41.286
Be reasonable, officer. We stopped off
to see if we could help the guy, we
couldn't help,

159
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.319
- we was too late. So let us get out
of here, okay?
- Let us go!

160
00:14:43.343 --> 00:14:45.992
We'll hold services for him later.
Like we got our lives to live,

161
00:14:46.022 --> 00:14:49.069
- like we ain't had breakfast yet,
you know what I mean?
- All right, all right...

162
00:14:49.099 --> 00:14:51.697
I wanna have to get your name, anyway.

163
00:14:52.624 --> 00:14:53.644
Hold it.

164
00:14:55.825 --> 00:14:56.825
Me?

165
00:14:57.827 --> 00:14:58.606
Wh-why?

166
00:14:58.738 --> 00:15:01.374
Just in case the coroner or somebody
wants a statement.

167
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.326
It is... J. Russell Finch,
2790 Penrose Boulevard, Fresno.

168
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:08.849
But I won't be home for a couple of weeks
but you can get me through my office.

169
00:15:08.873 --> 00:15:10.088
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Where is that?

170
00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:11.565
- What'd you say, sir?
- Where is your office?

171
00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:14.314
Oh, the-the office? Pacific Edible
Seaweed Company,

172
00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.484
and it's-it's-in... it's in Fresno.

173
00:15:16.514 --> 00:15:18.938
- But you can call me through my secretary.
- Ambulance is on its way.

174
00:15:18.962 --> 00:15:20.322
Yeah, the ambulance is on its way.

175
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.229
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

176
00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:26.032
Listen, we'd better shift those
cars up there. They're on the curb.

177
00:15:26.056 --> 00:15:28.337
Well, I guess that's about all we can get
from this group.

178
00:15:28.725 --> 00:15:30.566
Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen.

179
00:15:30.643 --> 00:15:31.676
Thanks.

180
00:15:39.312 --> 00:15:40.312
Well...

181
00:15:40.954 --> 00:15:42.824
...there's an unexpected twist for you.

182
00:15:43.802 --> 00:15:46.188
They're not going to like this
down at Santa Rosita.

183
00:15:47.107 --> 00:15:49.031
- Culpepper's gonna scream.
- Yeah...

184
00:15:49.421 --> 00:15:52.902
- Sir, we better get our story straight,
if we want Culpepper...
- What story, what story?

185
00:15:52.926 --> 00:15:55.344
He woke up as usual.
He started driving his car.

186
00:15:55.512 --> 00:15:57.053
He stopped a little place for breakfast.

187
00:15:57.077 --> 00:16:00.427
He went into the gents' room, he
climbed out the back window. So what?

188
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:03.751
Not even Culpepper is gonna say
we should've been in there with him.

189
00:16:03.853 --> 00:16:06.550
What got me is the way
he went s-sailing right out there.

190
00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:11.193
If I have to climb much more o'this,
I'll be laying there with him.

191
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:12.361
Poor soul.

192
00:16:21.454 --> 00:16:23.778
Melville, what happened?

193
00:16:24.124 --> 00:16:27.204
We couldn't do anything for him. Just
absolutely nothing we could do. Come on.

194
00:16:27.544 --> 00:16:28.544
Well?!

195
00:16:33.091 --> 00:16:35.874
- It was a terrible thing, terrible thing.
- Oh, Russell, I feel sick.

196
00:16:35.952 --> 00:16:37.751
Oh, take it easy, honey.
These things happen, you know.

197
00:16:37.802 --> 00:16:40.264
Now, what kind of attitude is that,
"these things happen"?!

198
00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:43.655
They only happen, because the whole
country is just full of people...

199
00:16:43.685 --> 00:16:46.478
who, when these things happen,
they just say, "These things happen."!

200
00:16:46.546 --> 00:16:50.221
- And that's why they happen!
- Let's try not to get upset.

201
00:16:50.251 --> 00:16:51.360
Come on, Russell.

202
00:16:52.065 --> 00:16:54.332
We got to have control
of what happens to us!

203
00:16:54.362 --> 00:16:57.542
- If we left it up to you,
we'd never hear the last of it!
- I understand...

204
00:16:58.241 --> 00:16:59.961
- [indistinct]
- You're right, you're right.

205
00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:08.909
Do you know what those half-wit
morons up in Sacramento do about it?!

206
00:17:09.002 --> 00:17:12.599
They just sit there with their big feet
up on their big desk...

207
00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:15.608
and milk 15 million people
of as much grand...

208
00:17:15.655 --> 00:17:17.480
- Listen, listen, I- I want
to say something.

209
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.069
I- I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I-I-I've got to say something.

210
00:17:20.477 --> 00:17:23.314
- What's the matter, Melville,
what are you looking at?
- Never mind, I'm watching something.

211
00:17:23.338 --> 00:17:25.619
Hey, Benjy. Benjy, turn around, sit still.

212
00:17:25.649 --> 00:17:29.376
- Play it straight.
- They're not kiddin' me.
They all went for it.

213
00:17:29.406 --> 00:17:31.639
Yeah? So what are you
gonna do now, huh?

214
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:34.247
Now listen, I want you to tell me
everything that man told you!

215
00:17:34.277 --> 00:17:36.449
Word for word! And
don't leave out anything.

216
00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:38.076
But do you think he really meant it?

217
00:17:40.533 --> 00:17:43.558
Monica, I mean- I mean, I don't know
about anybody else, but...

218
00:17:43.652 --> 00:17:45.979
some of them believed it.
Like those two back there.

219
00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:47.664
DON'T LOOK over there!

220
00:17:47.948 --> 00:17:51.466
I know where it is. It's under a Big W.
That's what he said, it's under a Big W.

221
00:17:51.496 --> 00:17:53.773
Like a 'windmill' or a 'waterfall'
or something like that.

222
00:17:53.797 --> 00:17:55.714
Oh, I hope it's not under a waterfall.

223
00:17:56.674 --> 00:17:59.314
Well, just think of something
that starts with a W, that's all.

224
00:17:59.426 --> 00:18:01.551
Wealth. Witch.

225
00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.139
Let's see. Where.

226
00:18:04.307 --> 00:18:07.053
Work. That's it. Work
I got to work on where it is.

227
00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:09.652
And the one thing Dr. Carroll said,
he said that Russell was to have

228
00:18:09.676 --> 00:18:12.963
no undue excitement for anytime for at
least two weeks, because of his condition.

229
00:18:12.993 --> 00:18:15.034
- Yeah, but I think...
- And that's why we came on this little trip,

230
00:18:15.058 --> 00:18:16.232
so Russell could just relax.

231
00:18:16.287 --> 00:18:17.960
- Yeah, but I think that...
- You should have told the police.

232
00:18:17.984 --> 00:18:20.627
You keep on saying that!
What's the police got to do with it?!

233
00:18:20.657 --> 00:18:24.061
Look, mother, I think the police were
chasing the man, they drove up so fast.

234
00:18:24.091 --> 00:18:26.562
Why shouldn't they've been chasing him?!
He was speeding!

235
00:18:26.609 --> 00:18:29.058
- Yeah, but I- I- I think...
- I'm only thinking of Russell's condition.

236
00:18:29.082 --> 00:18:32.987
You mean his financial condition. Because
that's the only condition that he has.

237
00:18:33.017 --> 00:18:37.355
Emily, do you know exactly - why
your husband had a nervous breakdown?

238
00:18:37.423 --> 00:18:42.311
It's because he has sunk $ 40,000,
including $ 15,000 of my money,

239
00:18:42.341 --> 00:18:45.639
- into a company that makes
seaweed for people to eat!
- Yeah, but...

240
00:18:45.734 --> 00:18:49.113
And now not only does nobody like it,
but it costs over $4 a can!

241
00:18:49.143 --> 00:18:50.840
- Yeah, but...
- "Yeah, but", what?!

242
00:18:51.437 --> 00:18:53.673
M- m- most people like it,
and I like it.

243
00:18:53.744 --> 00:18:55.954
And I'm working hard,
trying to keep the costs down.

244
00:18:55.984 --> 00:18:58.254
Yeah, you were working hard,
trying to keep the costs down...

245
00:18:58.278 --> 00:19:01.283
the day you ran out of your office,
and stood on the street screaming!

246
00:19:01.502 --> 00:19:03.407
- Mother!
- Oh, Emeline, shut up!

247
00:19:03.431 --> 00:19:04.867
- Mother...
- And you, too!

248
00:19:05.034 --> 00:19:07.746
Well, maybe-- maybe he was playing
some kind of a trick on everybody.

249
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.345
Did you think about that?
He might have been a practical joker!

250
00:19:10.375 --> 00:19:13.619
Oy... Monica, really. Practical!

251
00:19:13.835 --> 00:19:17.462
What kind of a man is going to play a
practical joke on complete strangers,

252
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.358
with every bone in his body
broken? Eww...

253
00:19:20.388 --> 00:19:23.468
- Watch! Watchtower! - No.
- Watch...

254
00:19:23.636 --> 00:19:24.678
- Wall...
- No.

255
00:19:24.846 --> 00:19:26.734
- Walnut tree!
- No, no!

256
00:19:26.764 --> 00:19:27.872
- Walnuts!
- No!

257
00:19:28.036 --> 00:19:29.641
- In bags!
- NO!

258
00:19:30.643 --> 00:19:34.158
Why are we doing only 35?!
Step on it a little! See what happens!

259
00:19:34.188 --> 00:19:36.327
- Mother!
- They'll all see what we're doing.

260
00:19:36.357 --> 00:19:38.453
Oh, go ahead and try it.
What've you got to lose?

261
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.580
Mother, he's not that good a driver.

262
00:19:51.998 --> 00:19:54.427
Going to leave the big boy behind, eh?

263
00:20:14.228 --> 00:20:16.355
What are you doing, why
are we slowing down?!

264
00:20:16.439 --> 00:20:19.116
It's no use. We- we can't
lose them this way.

265
00:20:19.146 --> 00:20:21.257
Oh, the inside of my stomach...

266
00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:38.756
What's that idiot in
the truck trying to do?

267
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.938
What's he doin' back there?

268
00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:44.216
I bet he's running out of gas! Good!

269
00:21:33.391 --> 00:21:34.916
What happened to you?

270
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:38.186
- Having trouble with your engine?
- Or did you run out of gas?

271
00:21:38.448 --> 00:21:42.548
- What, you bend your tailpipe?
- Oh, no. It was just one of my tires.

272
00:21:42.775 --> 00:21:44.401
I thought, um...

273
00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:48.489
Ah, shucks! Okay, so I was
trying to... Oh, rats.

274
00:21:48.531 --> 00:21:51.377
Look, this whole thing... I- I think
we're making a very big mistake.

275
00:21:51.455 --> 00:21:53.368
- I absolutely agree.
- So?

276
00:21:53.536 --> 00:21:55.764
So, I think we're just being a little
silly, running around like this.

277
00:21:55.788 --> 00:21:58.206
- Sure. We're getting nowhere.
- By George, he's right.

278
00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:01.775
So, why don't we do something sensible.
Why don't we just discuss this thing,

279
00:22:01.805 --> 00:22:04.431
- and-and reason something out?
- I'm with you, I'm with you.

280
00:22:04.461 --> 00:22:07.180
All right, now we can come to some
conclusion, like intelligent people.

281
00:22:07.204 --> 00:22:09.134
Hey yeah, let's do that,
um, what he said.

282
00:22:09.302 --> 00:22:12.629
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that way
nobody will have an advantage
on one another, right?

283
00:22:12.659 --> 00:22:13.650
- It's fair.
- Yeah.

284
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.673
- Right.
- We'd better get the cars
off that curve.

285
00:22:15.697 --> 00:22:18.419
Yeah, let's-let's not talk here,
on the road. Let's go over there,
there's plenty o'room, okay?

286
00:22:18.443 --> 00:22:20.055
- Okay.
- Fine, see you over there.

287
00:22:20.085 --> 00:22:22.225
- Yeah, right. Over there.
- Over there...

288
00:22:24.918 --> 00:22:26.943
You're through to Homicide.

289
00:22:29.113 --> 00:22:31.263
Santa Rosita Police Station...

290
00:22:31.616 --> 00:22:32.908
Detective Division.

291
00:22:33.076 --> 00:22:36.377
I'm connecting you now.
Santa Rosita Police Station.

292
00:22:36.496 --> 00:22:38.150
Detective Division, Matthews.

293
00:22:38.915 --> 00:22:41.625
No, Sheriff, the Chief isn't here.
He's a little late this morning.

294
00:22:42.668 --> 00:22:45.076
So I'll stay late after school.
Who is it?

295
00:22:45.171 --> 00:22:47.126
- Sheriff, Crockett County.
- Who?

296
00:22:47.632 --> 00:22:50.342
That's where the Smiler is!
I wonder if anything happened.

297
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.743
Gertie, will you put that call
through here?

298
00:22:53.215 --> 00:22:54.965
How about a little coffee, Schwartz?

299
00:23:03.481 --> 00:23:05.398
Hello, Sheriff! Culpepper.

300
00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:07.609
What'd he do, make a break?
What happened?

301
00:23:07.777 --> 00:23:09.694
Afraid we've got some
bad news for you.

302
00:23:10.044 --> 00:23:12.948
- Grogan's cashed in his chips.
- He what?

303
00:23:13.168 --> 00:23:15.782
<i>Crashed his car about 20 minutes ago.</i>

304
00:23:16.327 --> 00:23:18.411
<i>Now he was making a break, all right.</i>

305
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.165
Well... how did it happen?
Where did it happen?

306
00:23:23.727 --> 00:23:28.752
On... 39, about 18 miles east
of Danby Junction and...

307
00:23:28.782 --> 00:23:32.884
- <i>...nine miles west of Valley Center.</i>
- Were there any witnesses?

308
00:23:33.052 --> 00:23:35.733
<i>A few people went down
to see if they could help.</i>

309
00:23:35.763 --> 00:23:39.028
- Was he killed outright?
- I don't know, but I can find out.

310
00:23:39.058 --> 00:23:40.851
<i>Yeah, do that. Will you
see what they said?</i>

311
00:23:41.018 --> 00:23:42.690
Thanks very much, Sheriff.

312
00:23:47.841 --> 00:23:48.841
Well...

313
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.342
A great way to start the day.

314
00:23:52.405 --> 00:23:55.794
You wait for 15 years to solve
a really important case,

315
00:23:55.824 --> 00:23:57.824
and just when you get... yeah, well!

316
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.498
It's all right, Chief.
I'll get it for you.

317
00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:08.332
He did it again.

318
00:24:26.856 --> 00:24:29.147
<i>Get that fella's number!
Get his number!</i>

319
00:24:29.194 --> 00:24:31.821
Get that fella's number!
GET HIS NUMBER!!

320
00:24:37.241 --> 00:24:41.453
<i>[on radio] Item: One large furniture van.
Item: One red Volkswagen.</i>

321
00:24:41.621 --> 00:24:43.498
That's them. Call it in.

322
00:24:44.582 --> 00:24:46.499
2-1-6-2-2-1-5-8.

323
00:24:46.529 --> 00:24:49.294
Sir, we just made all four of them.
Parked alongside the road.

324
00:24:49.462 --> 00:24:51.803
They're just standing
there talking. Over.

325
00:24:51.983 --> 00:24:57.218
<i>Sammy, let that ambulance go,
and stay by the radio! Got it?</i>

326
00:24:57.392 --> 00:24:59.986
What I'm trying to say is... that, um...

327
00:25:00.142 --> 00:25:04.520
...this man that we were dealing with,
may have been some kind of a screwball,
you know what I mean?

328
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.023
The man said there was a certain amount
of money buried down in this park.

329
00:25:08.053 --> 00:25:09.989
- That's right. Yeah.
- Under a Big W.

330
00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:13.634
- Say, what is a 'Big W'?
- We find out, we'll send you a wire.

331
00:25:15.484 --> 00:25:18.882
It-it's only a possibility, now,
it's only a possibility that this man
was telling the truth.

332
00:25:18.906 --> 00:25:23.838
And if it was the truth, then it is a fact
that this place is almost 200 miles away.

333
00:25:24.282 --> 00:25:26.967
Now I suggest that we quietly
get into our cars...

334
00:25:27.135 --> 00:25:30.918
and drive down there
at a safe, sound speed...

335
00:25:31.012 --> 00:25:33.765
...keeping each other
in sight of each other.

336
00:25:33.834 --> 00:25:37.221
And well, when we get down there, we
dig up the money, providing that there
is some money there...

337
00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:40.833
...and well, if we do find it, we share it
amongst us in a simple manner.

338
00:25:40.863 --> 00:25:42.647
He's- he's got a point.
I think he's got something there.

339
00:25:42.671 --> 00:25:45.704
- And I think, we should go
straight to the police.
- The police? Why the police?

340
00:25:45.728 --> 00:25:49.800
It's all right, she's with us. Now,
what's this "fair shares for everybody"?

341
00:25:49.885 --> 00:25:52.456
Look, ma'am, all I said was:
we arrived in four vehicles.

342
00:25:52.486 --> 00:25:55.051
I- I think we should split it up
in four quarters.

343
00:25:56.123 --> 00:25:58.688
Four qua... quarters?
What are you talking about? Quarters?

344
00:25:58.718 --> 00:26:02.452
You mean you- you three each get
a quarter, and Benjy and I have got
to split a quarter?

345
00:26:02.685 --> 00:26:04.705
- That's right, that's right.
- Hey, what are you trying to pull?

346
00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:08.036
- Well, it seems fair enough to me.
- Oy, naturally, it seems fair enough
to you.

347
00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:12.987
- It just cheats us, that's all.
- $ 350,000 divided by four is,
let's say...

348
00:26:13.183 --> 00:26:16.551
...um-um, let's say, 87,500 bucks!

349
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:18.253
Sure, that's- that's right what it is.

350
00:26:18.283 --> 00:26:22.038
So the three of you would get $ 87,500
and Benjy and I have to split.

351
00:26:22.068 --> 00:26:23.867
Yeah, there was five of us
down at the wreck!

352
00:26:23.897 --> 00:26:26.561
- We should split it five ways.
- He's right, we should split it five ways.

353
00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:29.260
Well, I'm perfectly willing to
discuss it in a five-way manner.

354
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.933
Now we can discuss it in
a five-way manner, five shares...

355
00:26:32.161 --> 00:26:34.448
- ...um, each share would be a 70,000...

356
00:26:34.478 --> 00:26:36.332
70,000 bucks?

357
00:26:36.362 --> 00:26:39.328
Holy mackerel! Do you realize
how many loads

358
00:26:39.358 --> 00:26:43.186
- I'd have to haul from Modesto
to Yuma to get that...
- You're overlooking one little thing.

359
00:26:43.216 --> 00:26:45.418
- Yeah, we're overlooking one little...
- What little thing?

360
00:26:45.442 --> 00:26:47.938
- Yeah, what little thing?
- We can all count, can't we?

361
00:26:47.968 --> 00:26:50.704
- There were eight of us there!
- She's right, there were eight of us there.

362
00:26:50.728 --> 00:26:53.300
Well, speaking for my wife and myself,
we'd be just as happy with...

363
00:26:53.324 --> 00:26:57.055
You'd be perfectly happy with 2/8, instead
of a quarter? That's awfully big of you.

364
00:26:57.085 --> 00:26:58.935
There's nothing to be
gained by losing our temp...

365
00:26:58.959 --> 00:27:02.016
You have nothing to gain
except 3/8 of 350,000 bucks!

366
00:27:02.046 --> 00:27:04.087
- He's right. It's not fair to him.
- YOU SHUT UP!

367
00:27:04.117 --> 00:27:05.260
<font color="#FAAAAA"><u>That's our money you're giving away!</u></font>

368
00:27:05.284 --> 00:27:08.570
Wait a minute, hold it, hold it. Let's
just put it back the way it was before.

369
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.906
Either one quarter...

370
00:27:09.936 --> 00:27:11.740
...for each car, including the van,

371
00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:14.153
- ...or one fifth for each guy.
- One quarter, or one fifth...

372
00:27:14.177 --> 00:27:17.808
- Just because this old bag
has to stick her...
- HOW DARE YOU!!

373
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:23.592
- Madam. That was entirely unqualified.
- You big-stupid looking goon!

374
00:27:23.622 --> 00:27:25.541
Oh, hold it, lady.
He called you an old bag...

375
00:27:25.571 --> 00:27:28.350
- So he's sorry that he called you
an old bag.
- That's right, he's sorry.

376
00:27:28.374 --> 00:27:31.392
- I don't know that I'm so sorry.
- Oh, this is unseemly!

377
00:27:31.422 --> 00:27:35.097
- Yeah, it seems unseemly.
- We're all just behaving
like wild animals.

378
00:27:35.127 --> 00:27:36.796
Wild animals have more dignity!

379
00:27:36.826 --> 00:27:41.339
- Hold it, will you? We're wasting
a lot of time.
- He's right, we're wasting time.

380
00:27:41.369 --> 00:27:46.244
- Now, look, why don't we start all over,
only this time discuss it again intelligently,

381
00:27:46.274 --> 00:27:48.380
the way Melville said it the first place.

382
00:27:48.568 --> 00:27:52.668
Now look, there is no reason why
we cannot talk this...

383
00:28:04.674 --> 00:28:05.731
SHUT UP!!

384
00:28:06.272 --> 00:28:07.632
Capt. Culpepper.

385
00:28:08.531 --> 00:28:09.718
Oh, it's the Sheriff on the phone.

386
00:28:09.742 --> 00:28:12.642
See, Chief, I- I took this to
the cleaners, they said it's ruined.

387
00:28:13.057 --> 00:28:16.020
Oh, I did get my hands on it.
Put it in the back of my car.

388
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:17.835
- Right, sir.
- I'll take it, Sarge.

389
00:28:21.926 --> 00:28:23.662
Alright, alright.

390
00:28:24.917 --> 00:28:27.188
Hello, Sheriff? Culpepper.

391
00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:29.220
Got some news for ya, Captain.

392
00:28:29.756 --> 00:28:33.466
All the people in them four vehicles,
they're stopped aside the road,

393
00:28:33.496 --> 00:28:36.154
about 5 miles from where
the accident happened.

394
00:28:36.272 --> 00:28:38.382
- All are talking.
- What?

395
00:28:38.737 --> 00:28:40.211
Give me the exact position!

396
00:28:41.274 --> 00:28:46.251
Um... about 4 miles from Valley Center,
from the crossroad there.

397
00:28:46.281 --> 00:28:49.622
4 miles west... of Valley Center.

398
00:28:50.307 --> 00:28:53.545
- Ah-hah!
- <i>Got two of my best men undercover there.</i>

399
00:28:53.646 --> 00:28:55.046
Now look, Sheriff!

400
00:28:55.725 --> 00:28:57.817
Sheriff! Now look at those people.

401
00:28:57.847 --> 00:29:01.672
Under no circumstances must those people
know that they're under surveillance!

402
00:29:01.737 --> 00:29:04.001
- Right?
<i>- I already took care of that.</i>

403
00:29:04.165 --> 00:29:05.449
<i>Now, wa-- wait a minute!</i>

404
00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.050
Got the numbers, comin' in now.

405
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.703
<i>All 4 got California plates.</i>

406
00:29:12.056 --> 00:29:13.652
Put those down!

407
00:29:13.803 --> 00:29:15.812
Blue Chrysler Imperial Convertible.

408
00:29:15.842 --> 00:29:18.533
Number XRD-8-4-5.

409
00:29:18.563 --> 00:29:22.670
<i>Blue Chrysler Imperial Convertible,
number XRD <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>-8-4-5</u></font></i>

410
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.285
What do you know, this case
is not cold, it's wide open!

411
00:29:26.796 --> 00:29:29.596
Hey, Chief! Chief, come in
here now, will ya?

412
00:29:29.964 --> 00:29:32.556
Aye! What's new this morning?

413
00:29:32.598 --> 00:29:35.498
<i>...Convertible, number HCK-9-0-4.</i>

414
00:29:35.908 --> 00:29:39.933
- <i>Red Volkswagen convertible, number HCK904.</i>
- Well, well.

415
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.291
What is this? A new freeway?

416
00:29:42.321 --> 00:29:46.545
Chief, we got a situation here
that is absolutely incredible.

417
00:29:46.575 --> 00:29:49.780
- Now look, Smiler Grogan...
You remember him?
- Oh, yes.

418
00:29:50.034 --> 00:29:52.516
Smiler Grogan spent the night here, see?

419
00:29:52.546 --> 00:29:54.251
Made his break this morning,

420
00:29:54.943 --> 00:29:59.414
He drove up this way, got to here,
where he crashed and killed himself.

421
00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.825
But before he died, some
people stopped to help him.

422
00:30:03.203 --> 00:30:06.553
And they are now
stopped here, talking.

423
00:30:06.721 --> 00:30:09.543
- I think they're arguing about something.
- Uh-huh.

424
00:30:09.638 --> 00:30:13.869
And a Crockett County unit
has got them under... observation.

425
00:30:14.738 --> 00:30:16.370
You think he told 'em something?

426
00:30:16.825 --> 00:30:19.067
I don't think they stopped
to play Shinny, Chief.

427
00:30:19.445 --> 00:30:25.171
Let's all listen to him!
I said, right now LISTEN TO HIM!!

428
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:28.565
- Will you tell us that again, please,
what you told us before?

429
00:30:28.595 --> 00:30:30.805
I will try, but this will be
the last time.

430
00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:33.374
I'll try and tell ya. Now,
my plan is very simple.

431
00:30:34.116 --> 00:30:36.759
Now, we give shares to everybody
and for everything.

432
00:30:37.178 --> 00:30:39.246
Now, there were 8... there are 8 of us.

433
00:30:39.276 --> 00:30:42.176
Now, there's 8 shares for that.
Then there were 4 vehicles.

434
00:30:42.206 --> 00:30:45.307
Now, if we give 4 shares for that,
that's 12 shares already, right?

435
00:30:45.475 --> 00:30:47.643
Then, there were 5 of us
who went down to the wreck.

436
00:30:47.811 --> 00:30:49.167
Now, we give 5 shares for that.

437
00:30:49.479 --> 00:30:51.188
So that makes it 17, right?

438
00:30:51.356 --> 00:30:53.190
Now, 17 shares and then we add...

439
00:30:53.358 --> 00:30:56.371
the same number of shares as there were
people in each vehicle. Right?

440
00:30:56.401 --> 00:30:59.793
That's 3 for your group, 2 for your group
and 2 for us and 1 for you, right?

441
00:30:59.823 --> 00:31:02.370
Now, that adds up to 25 shares.

442
00:31:02.425 --> 00:31:07.663
Now, 25 into 350,000
is $14,000 per share.

443
00:31:07.831 --> 00:31:09.797
Now, figuring like that would mean...

444
00:31:09.827 --> 00:31:13.238
you'd get 3 shares for being
3 people, 1 share for having the car,

445
00:31:13.268 --> 00:31:15.754
1 share for going down
and looking at the wreck...

446
00:31:15.922 --> 00:31:18.382
and 3 more shares for being
3 more people in the car,

447
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:23.470
which would give you a total of 8 shares,
giving you $ 112,000.

448
00:31:23.638 --> 00:31:27.195
That should cover everything,
including the emancipation of women.

449
00:31:27.225 --> 00:31:28.494
Oh, wait a minute. Let's see now...

450
00:31:28.518 --> 00:31:31.604
As I understand, I got 1 share
for being 1 person,

451
00:31:31.771 --> 00:31:35.190
1 share for going down the hill,
1 share for the truck...

452
00:31:35.358 --> 00:31:38.027
and 1 share for being
a person in the truck.

453
00:31:38.194 --> 00:31:43.071
But no matter how you figure it out,
I still don't get as much as anybody else!

454
00:31:43.825 --> 00:31:45.798
Look, let me explain it once more.
You see...

455
00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:51.165
...they, their group, they, those 3
of them, they get $112,000, right?

456
00:31:51.333 --> 00:31:54.585
Those over there, them. They get $97,000.

457
00:31:54.753 --> 00:31:57.457
We. We us, we get $84,000.

458
00:31:57.487 --> 00:32:02.630
And you, by yourself,
you get $56,000. Alone,

459
00:32:02.886 --> 00:32:05.888
- and that's tax-free money.
- What do you mean, tax-free?

460
00:32:06.056 --> 00:32:10.143
I mean, um, if we go down to this park
and we uncover the money and we, um...

461
00:32:10.185 --> 00:32:12.895
have it, I mean, I'm sure he's
not gonna declare anything,

462
00:32:12.953 --> 00:32:15.035
I know, I know he's not gonna
declare anything...

463
00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:19.204
- and I'm not gonna to declare...
- What are you talking about, declare it?

464
00:32:19.736 --> 00:32:24.615
Oh, I mean, it's like non-taxable income,
It's like a... like a.. like a gift.

465
00:32:24.645 --> 00:32:28.389
But sure, if we find the money,
we still have to report the taxes.

466
00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:30.685
Otherwise, it's like stealing
from the government!

467
00:32:31.915 --> 00:32:35.793
- Could you explain it to him, please?
- Who, me? Well, um...

468
00:32:35.823 --> 00:32:39.505
Don't you see, if we find the money,
there may not be any taxes to pay on it...

469
00:32:39.645 --> 00:32:41.423
just because we did find the money.

470
00:32:41.591 --> 00:32:45.187
- But what he was trying to say is...
- Listen, everybody has to pay taxes.

471
00:32:45.595 --> 00:32:49.890
Even businessmen that rob and steal
and cheat from people every day,

472
00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:51.725
Even they have to pay taxes.

473
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.659
I give up. Look, anybody got a better,
fair- fairer plan, go ahead.

474
00:32:55.689 --> 00:32:59.443
There were 8 of us there,
so that simply means 8 shares.

475
00:32:59.734 --> 00:33:02.666
- 3 for us, 2 for you...
- Aah, this is hopeless.

476
00:33:02.696 --> 00:33:05.781
We gonna get no place if we gonna
continue listening to this old bag.

477
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:09.679
Hey, what are you trying to do, lady?
You trying to split us up so it becomes
every man's for himself?

478
00:33:09.703 --> 00:33:13.135
- And every woman for himself?
- One more funny remark from you,
buster...

479
00:33:13.182 --> 00:33:15.996
- Well, let's get out of here.
- Oh, please, please, don't argue anymore.
You heard everybody's...

480
00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.586
Whop! We figured it 17 different ways.

481
00:33:19.616 --> 00:33:21.905
And every time we
figured it, it was no good.

482
00:33:21.935 --> 00:33:25.718
Because no matter how we figured it,
somebody don't like the way we figured it.

483
00:33:25.885 --> 00:33:29.096
So now... there's only
one way to figure it.

484
00:33:29.126 --> 00:33:30.973
And that is: every man...

485
00:33:31.141 --> 00:33:33.767
...including the old bag, for himself!

486
00:33:33.935 --> 00:33:36.343
- So, good luck and may the best man win!

487
00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:41.033
Right! Except you, lady. May you
just... DROP DEAD!!

488
00:33:41.063 --> 00:33:43.485
All right, all right.
We all agree on that.

489
00:33:43.515 --> 00:33:48.475
Now look - let's be sensible about
this thing. There's money in this
for all of us, right?

490
00:33:48.689 --> 00:33:51.994
There's enough for you.
There's enough for you...

491
00:33:52.787 --> 00:33:54.172
and for me...

492
00:33:55.007 --> 00:33:56.999
and for you...

493
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:59.409
and there's enough for...

494
00:34:00.588 --> 00:34:02.122
Melville, my shoe!

495
00:34:02.255 --> 00:34:04.006
Get in the car!

496
00:34:32.619 --> 00:34:37.374
<i>2-1-5-8-2-1-6-2, four cars under
observation are passing this checkpoint.</i>

497
00:34:37.662 --> 00:34:39.370
Lead car is Plymouth Station Wagon.

498
00:34:39.586 --> 00:34:41.375
Next, the Ford van, the Volkswagen...

499
00:34:41.405 --> 00:34:44.046
<i>and the Chrysler Imperial Convertible,
all doing about 50.</i>

500
00:34:44.462 --> 00:34:46.256
Yep, they're on their way!

501
00:34:46.861 --> 00:34:50.623
<i>- All traveling in the same direction?</i>
- That's right, and according
to my boys...

502
00:34:50.653 --> 00:34:53.381
they're all on reckless
driving charges already.

503
00:34:53.411 --> 00:34:55.952
You know, none of those people
must suspect for a minute,

504
00:34:56.124 --> 00:34:57.893
that anybody is interested in them.

505
00:34:58.356 --> 00:35:03.212
<i>Now, Sheriff, will you get on to
Capt. Hardesty and see how many
helicopters he can let us have?</i>

506
00:35:03.548 --> 00:35:06.693
Well, I'll see what we can do
and I'll call you back.

507
00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:12.129
Now, where have I always told you
that the Smiler hid the dough?

508
00:35:12.159 --> 00:35:13.826
- I know, I know.
- Where?

509
00:35:14.293 --> 00:35:17.412
- Right... there.
- That's right, yeah.

510
00:35:17.756 --> 00:35:20.891
Which means, if these merrymakers
decide to go for it,

511
00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:23.460
they'll go to the
crossroads and turn south.

512
00:35:24.519 --> 00:35:27.474
But why did Smiler head east
when he made his break,

513
00:35:27.504 --> 00:35:29.633
if the money is down here somewhere?

514
00:35:29.663 --> 00:35:35.097
Oh, ho-ho-ho, Aloysius, I mean the guy
is just being clever. You can't...

515
00:35:35.474 --> 00:35:37.349
$5 will get you $10...

516
00:35:37.718 --> 00:35:39.835
they go to the crossroads,
and turn south.

517
00:35:39.936 --> 00:35:41.436
You got yourself a bet!

518
00:35:55.928 --> 00:35:58.399
"Mount Shasta National Forest."
Are we anywhere near...?

519
00:35:58.446 --> 00:36:00.581
That's on up top!
Look down near the bottom.

520
00:36:02.442 --> 00:36:05.427
- Are we near Oregon?
- That's 700 miles from here.

521
00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:21.469
Don't pass it, Ding!

522
00:36:28.471 --> 00:36:30.473
You will lose your license, Ding.

523
00:36:35.444 --> 00:36:38.327
We are the ones with the Imperial
and we're running last?!

524
00:36:38.357 --> 00:36:40.203
I can't- can't pass them on the curves.

525
00:36:40.479 --> 00:36:43.247
Oh, go on, go ahead.
Look, there's a space!

526
00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.233
Well, what are you waiting for,
an engraved invitation?!

527
00:36:46.517 --> 00:36:48.712
GET OVER!! GET...

528
00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.839
<i>Get to the side where you belong!</i>

529
00:37:45.561 --> 00:37:47.813
I said it before and I'll say it again:

530
00:37:48.201 --> 00:37:50.251
I didn't want to move to California.

531
00:37:51.558 --> 00:37:56.015
7-6-6-1-7-6-4-8, I'm located
at the Valley Center crossroads.

532
00:37:56.236 --> 00:37:58.997
<i>They're just coming up to you.
Looks like the Station Wagon's leading,</i>

533
00:37:59.039 --> 00:38:01.717
<i>Volkswagen, the Imperial Convertible
and moving van, in that order.</i>

534
00:38:02.315 --> 00:38:03.934
Here comes the Station Wagon now...

535
00:38:04.377 --> 00:38:05.719
...he's turning south.

536
00:38:15.607 --> 00:38:18.618
- <i>All 4 now moving south on C-18.</i>
- Thank you.

537
00:38:18.648 --> 00:38:22.168
- <i>Looks like they're making for Highway 66...</i>
- Well, that does it. They're headed south.

538
00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:23.349
Look!

539
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:28.904
Airfield, 5 miles to the south.

540
00:38:30.054 --> 00:38:32.101
- Now, $ 5 will get you $ 10...
- No, no, no.

541
00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:35.644
I've got to admit it's enjoyable,
but the entertainment is to expensive.

542
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.224
I'll be in my office.

543
00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:50.351
- Did you find it yet?
- I can't find it anywhere.

544
00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:52.153
Oh look, you take the wheel,
give me the map.

545
00:38:52.183 --> 00:38:54.272
Take the wheel, give me the map!

546
00:38:54.892 --> 00:38:57.589
It must be here.
Right over here! Valley Center!

547
00:38:57.619 --> 00:38:58.776
Yeah, it's right here!

548
00:38:58.806 --> 00:39:01.153
- There's an airfield not far from...
- Get it off!

549
00:39:01.794 --> 00:39:03.573
<i>Get it off your face!</i>

550
00:39:05.811 --> 00:39:08.340
- Get it off me!
- Don't go in there!

551
00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.081
Swing over! Watch out!

552
00:39:15.711 --> 00:39:17.712
- Take it off.
- Get it off!

553
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.151
I've had enough!

554
00:39:34.632 --> 00:39:37.107
- They're gonna hire aeroplanes.
- Never mind. Let's go!

555
00:39:37.275 --> 00:39:40.643
- But if they get planes, they'll be
there hours before...
- I said, never mind! LET'S GO!!

556
00:39:40.667 --> 00:39:42.681
Nobody's gonna get me up in the air.

557
00:39:55.764 --> 00:39:59.790
Heh! I wanted to be a reasonable guy
and give them all reasonable shares. No...

558
00:40:00.449 --> 00:40:01.967
They wanted every man for himself.

559
00:40:01.997 --> 00:40:04.677
Well, I'm now gonna show them
what kind of man they're dealing with!

560
00:40:13.379 --> 00:40:16.342
Oh, it's stalled, Benjy.
We got dust in the carburetor!

561
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.134
You'll see who the jury will believe!

562
00:40:20.461 --> 00:40:22.649
Because it's our word against yours!

563
00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:26.146
- And besides, there were three of us
and only one of you!
- Now listen...

564
00:40:26.201 --> 00:40:28.278
- So, you'll see who the jury
will believe!
- Hold it, please!

565
00:40:28.302 --> 00:40:30.529
While we're arguing, those other four
are hiring planes.

566
00:40:30.559 --> 00:40:32.945
- Yeah.
- Look, we're all are hung up here.

567
00:40:32.975 --> 00:40:35.067
Now, what we need is a breakdown crew.

568
00:40:35.097 --> 00:40:36.989
Yeah, if we got get to some place
where we could rent a car.

569
00:40:37.013 --> 00:40:39.715
Yeah, but there's no traffic,
we might be waiting here for...

570
00:40:39.883 --> 00:40:42.287
Wait a minute! By George,
come to Vegas, dammit!

571
00:40:42.317 --> 00:40:43.797
There's a bicycle in the van!

572
00:40:44.094 --> 00:40:45.574
Well, will you take us or won't you?!

573
00:40:46.526 --> 00:40:48.749
- For $250, I guess I will.
- Good.

574
00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:52.679
Then you take care of the plane.
We'll leave our car here, and we'll
come back till tomorrow.

575
00:40:52.882 --> 00:40:54.286
- Meanwhile I'll give you a check.
- Check?

576
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.510
Yeah, check. It's-it's a Traveler's check
from the Bank of America. Don't worry.

577
00:40:57.968 --> 00:40:59.289
- Oh, boy.
- Hey!

578
00:41:00.348 --> 00:41:02.878
Are you a pilot?
Is there a plane around?

579
00:41:02.908 --> 00:41:04.254
Right both times.

580
00:41:04.308 --> 00:41:06.407
Come on, where's an airplane?
I don't see any around.

581
00:41:06.437 --> 00:41:08.405
There's only one. And we have
chartered it.

582
00:41:08.435 --> 00:41:11.293
- So you and your friend...
- Is that right, did you make
a deal with them?

583
00:41:11.317 --> 00:41:11.851
- Right.

584
00:41:11.881 --> 00:41:14.629
Well, is there a place close around where
we can charter another plane?

585
00:41:14.653 --> 00:41:17.315
- The nearest place will be up
in North Valley.
- Oh, where's that?

586
00:41:17.345 --> 00:41:21.157
Another side of Valley Center,
about, um... 12 miles, 15 miles?

587
00:41:21.292 --> 00:41:24.474
- Excuse us.
- Filibuster, filibuster!

588
00:41:24.676 --> 00:41:26.647
Now you can stick around
and watch us take off.

589
00:41:26.677 --> 00:41:29.260
Listen, dentist. I hate dentists.

590
00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:33.274
And I hate you so much, that I'm
not even able to tell you how much
in front of your wife!

591
00:41:33.304 --> 00:41:34.578
And vice versa.

592
00:41:36.279 --> 00:41:40.751
Come on over here! Come on over here!
Come on!

593
00:41:45.402 --> 00:41:50.138
Oh, boy! When the people who own this
see this, boy, I sure hate to think what...

594
00:41:50.168 --> 00:41:51.417
Never mind, never mind.

595
00:41:52.524 --> 00:41:56.206
Here's the bike. Look, you get
to the nearest phone and hire
the best car that you can find.

596
00:41:56.528 --> 00:42:00.979
But-but... this is a girl's bike.
This is for a little girl.

597
00:42:01.315 --> 00:42:04.360
Oh, listen. I've got to get the rest of
this stuff back, so I can lock up the van.

598
00:42:04.384 --> 00:42:07.145
We'll put everything away. Will you
get going, please? Will you hurry?

599
00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:08.770
Okay.

600
00:42:10.161 --> 00:42:11.365
I gotta admit...

601
00:42:12.825 --> 00:42:14.538
...I feel kinda silly.

602
00:42:15.096 --> 00:42:16.450
You know what I mean?

603
00:42:31.267 --> 00:42:34.197
Hey, look, they're coming back!
I bet they couldn't get a plane!

604
00:42:34.227 --> 00:42:37.916
- Just the one car. The other two must've...
- You must stop them! Do something
to stop them!

605
00:42:37.958 --> 00:42:40.358
- Make them give us a lift!
- Here they come, here they come!

606
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.330
- Hey, stop! Hey, stop!
- Hey, stop! Hey, stop!

607
00:42:47.946 --> 00:42:50.950
- That stupid idiots are not even
going the right way!
- No.

608
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:54.151
They've given up and they are
going to the police.

609
00:42:54.552 --> 00:42:58.252
They just remembered there's such
a thing as human dignity, that's all.

610
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:06.680
7-6-6-1-7-6-4-8. Listen, Sheriff.

611
00:43:07.023 --> 00:43:09.483
Two guys in a Volkswagen are
heading north. Do we tail 'em? Over.

612
00:43:09.507 --> 00:43:12.983
- No. Pete and Sam can pick 'em up
at Valley Center.
- Right.

613
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.409
Good morning.

614
00:43:36.439 --> 00:43:38.399
- Hello.
- Good morning.
- Had an accident?

615
00:43:39.024 --> 00:43:41.559
- Anyone hurt?
- No, but we've got to get to a phone.

616
00:43:41.786 --> 00:43:43.886
- Can you give us a lift?
- A lift?

617
00:43:44.162 --> 00:43:46.883
Of course, I should be
absolutely delighted.

618
00:43:48.783 --> 00:43:51.869
Upsy-daisy. I'm afraid you
caught me on the hub there.

619
00:43:52.116 --> 00:43:54.422
Oh, Madam, do be careful.
I have some specimens of cactus...

620
00:43:54.446 --> 00:43:57.833
- GO!!!
- I say, I'm most frightfully sorry.

621
00:43:58.001 --> 00:44:01.223
You see, I've been gathering
some samples of desert flora.

622
00:44:01.253 --> 00:44:03.107
Uh-oh, where shall I put this?

623
00:44:04.471 --> 00:44:06.050
Oh, boy!

624
00:44:07.719 --> 00:44:09.776
- Good morning. Morning.
- Morning.

625
00:44:09.929 --> 00:44:13.380
Yeah, it certainly is. Look, buddy, we are
in a hurry. We've got to get to a phone.

626
00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:15.292
- Of course, of course, with pleasure.
- Would you please hurry?

627
00:44:15.316 --> 00:44:18.687
I say, jolly nasty accident there.
Jolly lucky nobody was hurt.

628
00:44:18.855 --> 00:44:22.087
Now, where did you get that funny accent?
Are you from Harvard or something?

629
00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:25.027
Harvard? Rather not. I'm English.

630
00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:26.796
Sounds so foreign.

631
00:44:27.072 --> 00:44:30.182
Really? Oh, I say, we haven't
introduced ourselves, have we?

632
00:44:30.212 --> 00:44:32.803
My name is Algernon Hawthorne...
Col. Hawthorne, actually.

633
00:44:32.833 --> 00:44:36.092
- You're a Colonel?
- Well, um... Lieutenant colonel, actually.

634
00:44:36.122 --> 00:44:37.882
My name is Finch, and this is my wife.

635
00:44:37.944 --> 00:44:40.581
And this is my mother-in-law...
Mrs. Marcus.

636
00:44:41.169 --> 00:44:43.712
Oh, I say, do stuff those
into the back, will you?

637
00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.090
Cactuses, Ma'am. It's rather
a hobby of mine.

638
00:44:46.258 --> 00:44:49.128
Been spending the last 10 days
gathering some for my collection.

639
00:44:49.399 --> 00:44:51.317
Nothing spectacular, actually.

640
00:44:51.763 --> 00:44:54.888
Cereus echinocactus, opuntia.
That sort o'thing.

641
00:44:55.267 --> 00:44:57.601
Been enjoying a spot of leave,
actually, from Vandenberg.

642
00:44:57.769 --> 00:44:59.748
- From what?
- Vandenberg.

643
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.647
The- the missile place.

644
00:45:01.934 --> 00:45:04.900
Been attached there for last 10 months.
Liaison work.

645
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.903
All very hush-hush
and whoosh-whoosh.

646
00:45:09.461 --> 00:45:11.211
That sort of thing, you know.

647
00:45:13.573 --> 00:45:15.328
Please, will you look at the road?

648
00:45:16.329 --> 00:45:18.330
Yes. Whoosh-whoosh.

649
00:45:25.845 --> 00:45:28.214
- Don't stop! Keep moving!
- Mother! - I think, we should stop...

650
00:45:28.238 --> 00:45:32.598
- I think we should stop for the...
- That big stupid lout, he was the one
who ran into us! Go on, keep moving!

651
00:45:55.796 --> 00:45:57.553
THAT?!

652
00:45:57.809 --> 00:46:00.388
You mean, you tell me that...
that- that's it?

653
00:46:00.412 --> 00:46:03.996
- Yeph, that's her.
- But would... will she fly?

654
00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:08.373
Well, not seen share one of beauty
contests, but boy... she'll fly.

655
00:46:10.412 --> 00:46:12.779
- It's nothin', just a-brake some wire.
- Yeah.

656
00:46:12.809 --> 00:46:16.112
Melville, I'm not going up
in this thing. It's just not safe!

657
00:46:16.142 --> 00:46:17.832
Honey, please, would you
leave it to me?

658
00:46:20.297 --> 00:46:21.817
W-what is this thing,
hanging out here?

659
00:46:21.846 --> 00:46:24.793
That's an exhaustor. She kicks out
a little smoke every once in a while.

660
00:46:24.879 --> 00:46:27.888
But you are a licensed pilot
to carry passengers, right?

661
00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:31.255
Well, now, nobody said anything
about a license. I was only trying
to do you a favor...

662
00:46:31.279 --> 00:46:33.920
- sort of, um, informal.
- Where the passengers sit?

663
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:35.554
- Up front, ma'am.
- Oh.

664
00:46:38.752 --> 00:46:40.651
But haven't you got
another car that we...

665
00:46:40.819 --> 00:46:43.500
What? Oh, alright. Thanks.

666
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:47.159
Look, are you sure you can't rent us
that truck out there? I'll pay.

667
00:46:47.201 --> 00:46:49.062
I told you, mister, we can't.

668
00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:52.121
This is our first week open.
How could we do it without our truck?

669
00:46:52.289 --> 00:46:53.783
We're in business.

670
00:46:54.249 --> 00:46:56.771
We'll have to speak to the Englishman.
If we tell him what happened...

671
00:46:56.795 --> 00:46:59.613
Oh, Russell, you wouldn't. How can you
even admit we're involved in it?!

672
00:46:59.637 --> 00:47:01.475
He'll say he's entitled to a share!

673
00:47:01.505 --> 00:47:03.936
Yeah, he would be entitled to a share
if he drove us all the way down there,

674
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.927
and if we don't tell him all about it,
he won't drive us down there.

675
00:47:07.387 --> 00:47:09.514
Oh, you're s-such a genius.

676
00:47:10.057 --> 00:47:11.724
Listen! Only 10%!

677
00:47:11.801 --> 00:47:14.268
There's no reason at all
why he should expect any more!

678
00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:16.066
That's what we'll do.

679
00:47:16.096 --> 00:47:18.065
$5. Thank you and come in again.

680
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.538
Ah, there you are.
Had any luck with another car?

681
00:47:21.585 --> 00:47:23.745
That's what I wanna talk
to you about, Mr. Hawthorne...

682
00:47:23.973 --> 00:47:25.158
How would you...

683
00:47:26.186 --> 00:47:29.743
What would you say if I told you that we
know of a very simple way for you to earn...

684
00:47:31.696 --> 00:47:33.244
$35,000?

685
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:37.746
- 35,000 - what?
- Dollars.

686
00:47:51.695 --> 00:47:54.446
Thanks for stopping. Listen, can you-
can you give me a lift?

687
00:47:55.407 --> 00:47:58.617
What's with the little kiddy bicycle?
What are you - some kind of a nut?

688
00:47:58.785 --> 00:48:02.332
No, you see, I- I had an accident. Look,
I gotta get to Santa Rosita, and fast.

689
00:48:02.362 --> 00:48:04.725
Well, I can't help you, friend.
I'm turning off the road a little way up.

690
00:48:04.749 --> 00:48:06.875
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let me just think.

691
00:48:07.043 --> 00:48:10.504
I gotta tell someone. Look, have you got
a couple o' hours you could spare?

692
00:48:10.584 --> 00:48:11.797
A couple o' hours?

693
00:48:11.965 --> 00:48:15.248
Hey, pal, you've been out in the sun
too long. You better watch this, 'cause
you're starting to crack up.

694
00:48:15.272 --> 00:48:17.453
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Listen! Just- wait a minute!

695
00:48:17.477 --> 00:48:18.938
Just-- just hear me out.

696
00:48:20.015 --> 00:48:21.599
Now, what I'm gonna tell you...

697
00:48:21.629 --> 00:48:23.834
...you just ain't gonna believe
it could've happened.

698
00:48:24.364 --> 00:48:26.764
But, you see, there was an accident
here a little while back.

699
00:48:26.897 --> 00:48:30.701
About 20 miles back.
It involved $350,000.

700
00:48:31.091 --> 00:48:32.583
Now, like I said...

701
00:48:33.403 --> 00:48:36.795
...when I tell you this, you just ain't
gonna believe it could've happened.

702
00:48:38.825 --> 00:48:40.700
Try me. I'm pretty gullible.

703
00:48:41.971 --> 00:48:44.968
I just won't fly in this old...
Now look into it.

704
00:48:45.281 --> 00:48:46.911
Look at how it's shuddering.

705
00:48:47.042 --> 00:48:50.082
Can't we-- cant'we just get back in
the car and go on with our second
honeymoon...

706
00:48:50.112 --> 00:48:51.152
and forget all about this?

707
00:48:51.184 --> 00:48:54.491
Honey, please, darling,
believe me, everything is all right.

708
00:48:54.563 --> 00:48:57.077
Do you think I'd take
a chance with you,

709
00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:59.170
I mean, if there was any danger
in flying this thing?

710
00:48:59.194 --> 00:49:01.400
This is a plane that's really built,
I mean, you know...

711
00:49:01.602 --> 00:49:04.108
Um, look, when was this plane built?

712
00:49:04.132 --> 00:49:07.070
- 1916.
- 1916.

713
00:49:07.353 --> 00:49:11.531
1916. I mean, they... these--
these planes are tried and true.

714
00:49:11.561 --> 00:49:14.357
I mean, there's nothing experimental
about these planes, you know what
I mean?

715
00:49:14.381 --> 00:49:17.359
So, come on. Let's have one
big adventure! Come on!

716
00:49:17.389 --> 00:49:19.750
Get up there and have some fun.
Come on, here we go!

717
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.056
<i>- That scratched the paint.
- Help!</i>

718
00:50:43.032 --> 00:50:44.815
I never saw nothing like that one before.

719
00:50:45.203 --> 00:50:47.303
You better tell MPAA to
pick his license <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>number.</u></font>

720
00:50:47.814 --> 00:50:50.424
God, the thing that bothers me
is about this Big W.

721
00:50:50.831 --> 00:50:52.654
Are you sure you told me
all you know about it?

722
00:50:52.678 --> 00:50:55.347
I mean, you sure you don't know
what that guy meant by the 'Big W'?

723
00:50:55.377 --> 00:50:58.543
No, but none of 'em know.
It's just who gets there, and first.

724
00:50:58.922 --> 00:51:00.817
Well, what do you say? Is it a deal?

725
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:03.360
Um... Deal!

726
00:51:06.388 --> 00:51:10.381
Oh, kid, you better get that bike
out of there. Somebody could trip
over it in the dark.

727
00:52:32.015 --> 00:52:34.729
Fellas, I'm glad you're here.
Look, I need your help.

728
00:52:34.759 --> 00:52:37.991
Here's what happened. I had this blowout.
I think there's a spare in the back.

729
00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:41.584
It may be a little flat. Take a look
at it, will ya, kid? Is there an airport
anyplace around here?

730
00:52:41.608 --> 00:52:44.722
Look, if the spare is flat, don't bother
fixing. Give me a new tire, allright?

731
00:52:44.752 --> 00:52:46.786
You ain't got a new tire, then
you have to fix the spare.

732
00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:49.920
But don't look at me, move it, would you?
You could be gassing up as...

733
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:51.870
Wait, what is it, a staring contest?
Come on!

734
00:52:51.894 --> 00:52:54.256
Move, move, will you, kid?
Come on!

735
00:52:54.747 --> 00:52:55.972
Oh, now, what is it?

736
00:52:56.268 --> 00:52:59.221
You know what His Honor is like.
I don't want to keep him waiting.

737
00:52:59.251 --> 00:53:01.956
I'll make it fast. It's partly him
I want to talk to you about.

738
00:53:02.064 --> 00:53:03.200
- The Mayor?
- Yeah.

739
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:05.881
Yeah. And the Counselor.
Now look, Al...

740
00:53:05.911 --> 00:53:09.812
...you know, next week the counselor is
gonna start talking about pensions again.

741
00:53:09.983 --> 00:53:13.488
Well now... Oh, I know that you think...

742
00:53:13.809 --> 00:53:15.814
...that you know everything
that I'm going to say.

743
00:53:15.844 --> 00:53:17.784
But you don't know the whole story.

744
00:53:18.103 --> 00:53:22.299
Al... in four months I'll be through.
I'll be finished.

745
00:53:22.329 --> 00:53:23.636
<font color="#FAAAAA"><u>Now ...</u></font>

746
00:53:23.977 --> 00:53:25.866
The pension in my grade...

747
00:53:26.176 --> 00:53:30.864
...has not been upped one red cent
since 1934!

748
00:53:31.687 --> 00:53:33.722
Now, Al...

749
00:53:34.237 --> 00:53:37.102
...if the Mayor will get behind
a resolution...

750
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:40.028
Oh, what can I do?
I can't put any pressure on the Mayor!

751
00:53:40.058 --> 00:53:41.901
You can. You can, Al.

752
00:53:42.314 --> 00:53:43.549
That's the whole point!

753
00:53:43.873 --> 00:53:46.081
This case, I'm gonna have
finished by tonight.

754
00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:49.030
It's one of the biggest cases
we've ever had across our books!

755
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:51.359
I want yoo to tell the Mayor about it.

756
00:53:51.671 --> 00:53:52.671
Tell him!

757
00:53:52.964 --> 00:53:57.511
Tell him the money is right here,
where I always said it was, right
in this neighborhood!

758
00:53:58.206 --> 00:54:01.501
And tell him what credit is gonna be
reflected upon the department!

759
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.131
Oh, come on, Aloysius, get in there
and pitch a little for me, will you?

760
00:54:06.299 --> 00:54:08.425
Well... I can try.

761
00:54:08.832 --> 00:54:10.844
Well... and he'll listen to you.

762
00:54:11.327 --> 00:54:15.211
And if he gets behind this,
it'll pass. Unanimously.

763
00:54:15.971 --> 00:54:17.350
Now, you know...

764
00:54:17.814 --> 00:54:19.561
...you know, Al, I got it coming.

765
00:54:19.921 --> 00:54:22.613
Well... I'll do everything I can.

766
00:54:22.888 --> 00:54:24.608
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

767
00:54:25.167 --> 00:54:30.030
Now. Now, there-there is just one other
little thing about... No, nothing.

768
00:54:30.499 --> 00:54:31.499
Vacation.

769
00:54:31.802 --> 00:54:35.579
Once I get Smiler Grogan out of the way,
my desk is clear.

770
00:54:35.791 --> 00:54:41.119
I'd like to take a three-week vacation.
Take Ginger on a... you know, real
nice holiday.

771
00:54:41.488 --> 00:54:43.973
- That all right with you?
- Why, of course, it's all right.

772
00:54:44.003 --> 00:54:47.033
Oh, thanks, thanks. I can hardly
wait to tell her.

773
00:54:47.063 --> 00:54:49.674
- And you won't forget about the Mayor?
- Oh no.

774
00:54:50.169 --> 00:54:53.130
I'll do my best. I promise you that.

775
00:54:53.842 --> 00:54:56.319
Aloysius, I'll never
forget you for this.

776
00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.537
You know something, Al?
I got a feeling this morning...

777
00:54:59.824 --> 00:55:03.053
- ...everything's coming my way.
- Yeah. He-he.

778
00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.727
SYLVESTER!!

779
00:55:18.871 --> 00:55:21.731
- Well, why did you do that for?
- What are you shouting for?
- Mommy!

780
00:55:21.761 --> 00:55:24.087
- Do you have to scare everybody
out the crap?!

781
00:55:24.117 --> 00:55:26.083
- What, are you crazy?
- Why didn't I think?

782
00:55:26.113 --> 00:55:28.181
We've been running around
like a pack of lunatics!

783
00:55:28.211 --> 00:55:32.308
And all the time... why didn't I
think about Sylvester? He's
sitting there right now!

784
00:55:32.338 --> 00:55:33.811
- He lives on Silver Strand Beach!

785
00:55:33.841 --> 00:55:36.914
- Sure, I never even thought about that.
- Who on Earth is Sylvester?

786
00:55:36.944 --> 00:55:39.662
He's my son, he's Emeline's brother.
He's a lifeguard down there!

787
00:55:39.692 --> 00:55:43.019
You know, I'm not entirely certain
that you haven't damaged this machine.

788
00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:51.308
How many blowouts up here?
Why don't you move closer to the city
and get more action?

789
00:55:51.916 --> 00:55:55.675
Oh, kid, don't mind polishing, this is
wonderful clean. I got a lot of cars.
Don't bother.

790
00:55:55.705 --> 00:55:57.299
You! You did a good job.

791
00:55:57.329 --> 00:55:59.128
Here, boys, have a drink on me.
Keep the change.

792
00:55:59.152 --> 00:56:00.605
Is ttah all right? I took
care of your buddy.

793
00:56:00.629 --> 00:56:02.244
- And let me get out of here now.
- YOU!!

794
00:56:02.274 --> 00:56:06.567
Oh no! It's that lunatic, the one who
escaped from the asylum last night!
Watch him!

795
00:56:06.597 --> 00:56:10.772
He's a homicidal maniac! Get on the
phone, yell "Mayday." Yell "Mayday"!

796
00:56:10.802 --> 00:56:15.056
Oh, listen to me! I'm a psychiatrist.
This man is insane! I'm not your nurse.

797
00:56:15.086 --> 00:56:18.924
- He has a hate complex.
Calm down! Calm down!
- SHUT UP!!

798
00:56:19.413 --> 00:56:22.242
Somebody will stumble over the little
girl's bicycle in the dark, huh?

799
00:56:22.386 --> 00:56:25.593
Well, when I finish with you, they'll be
stumbling over you in the dark!

800
00:56:25.903 --> 00:56:27.988
You get on the phone!
Get on the phone!

801
00:56:31.558 --> 00:56:32.934
Look out! LOOK OUT!!

802
00:56:34.495 --> 00:56:38.128
- Look, look, I was clowning.
<i>- Get out of here!</i>

803
00:56:38.158 --> 00:56:42.153
Sir, wait a minute! You've got this all...
Why don't you stop?! Get some...

804
00:56:42.183 --> 00:56:46.053
I'll kill you, I'll kill you.
I'll kill you! Aarrgh!

805
00:56:46.083 --> 00:56:50.654
You got this... Wait!
Don't take it so seri...

806
00:56:50.684 --> 00:56:52.703
Will you stop staring and get out of...

807
00:56:53.061 --> 00:56:55.414
He's out of his head!

808
00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.917
- He's crazy!
- Want us to call... RAY!!

809
00:56:59.155 --> 00:57:01.817
- Wait! Wait!
- It's a brand-new pump!

810
00:57:01.847 --> 00:57:04.142
- Get out of here!
- Stop!

811
00:57:04.172 --> 00:57:06.860
Stop that! Stop that! He's crazy!

812
00:57:09.446 --> 00:57:13.099
Very good. Quick thinking. I'm proud
of you. Very good. Tie him up.

813
00:57:13.587 --> 00:57:16.734
And I'll have a copule of orderlies
come by with a straitjacket.

814
00:57:16.764 --> 00:57:18.861
- Very good. I'm proud of you, boys.
- I never saw anything...

815
00:57:18.885 --> 00:57:21.829
- Hey! How many people has he killed?
- There'll be more.

816
00:57:21.859 --> 00:57:24.174
Just tie him up until the boys
in the white jackets get him.

817
00:57:24.198 --> 00:57:27.142
I'm proud of you, boys.
You did a real good job. Very good!

818
00:57:27.172 --> 00:57:29.323
Look me up. I'm in the book. Dr. Zillman.

819
00:57:33.233 --> 00:57:34.875
Holy mackerel!

820
00:57:35.591 --> 00:57:37.166
When he started to...

821
00:57:37.196 --> 00:57:40.717
Listen, we better get him tied up!
What we gonna do if he comes to?!

822
00:57:40.747 --> 00:57:42.727
- Hit him again!
- Oh, I couldn't!

823
00:57:43.312 --> 00:57:47.197
- Look, sir, we've just got to get
to Santa Rosita.
- I tell you, this is a club.

824
00:57:47.227 --> 00:57:49.530
We don't do charter work. There's
nobody around who can take you.

825
00:57:49.554 --> 00:57:51.821
Hey! Whose plane is that, over there?

826
00:57:51.851 --> 00:57:55.341
That belongs to Mr. Tyler Fitzgerald, but
I don't think he's going anywhere today.

827
00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:58.631
- Well, is he here? Can we see him?
- Mr. Fitzgerald's in the billiard room.

828
00:57:58.701 --> 00:58:00.851
- He is-- well, he's asleep.
Nobody can talk to him.

829
00:58:00.906 --> 00:58:02.398
- Can we just ask him a question?

830
00:58:02.428 --> 00:58:04.580
- Couldn't we just ask him?
- No, you can't!

831
00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:07.717
Hello? Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

832
00:58:11.661 --> 00:58:15.172
Come on, Benjy! It must be him. Here,
that must be Mr. Fitzgerald over there!

833
00:58:15.202 --> 00:58:18.876
- Well, you can't disturb Mr. Fitzgerald!
- Hey! We are not gonna disturb him,
we just want to talk to him.

834
00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.757
- Mr... Mr. Fitzgerald...
- Let him rest, please!

835
00:58:20.781 --> 00:58:21.452
Shhh!

836
00:58:21.482 --> 00:58:24.401
Don't shush me! We're trying to talk
to him. Just a moment, please.

837
00:58:24.431 --> 00:58:26.438
Wake up, won't you please,
Mr. Fitzgerald?

838
00:58:27.496 --> 00:58:29.378
- I think he's got a cold.
- Ahh...

839
00:58:29.594 --> 00:58:32.742
Now, now, Mr. Fitzgerald, listen.
Please, sir.

840
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:36.454
We hate to disturb your sleep,
like this, but-- this is an emergency.

841
00:58:36.484 --> 00:58:38.121
You have no right to crash in here.

842
00:58:40.952 --> 00:58:42.563
Oh, that's a head cold.

843
00:58:42.618 --> 00:58:45.046
Mr. Fitzgerald, listen, you-
you know where Rosita Beach is?

844
00:58:45.076 --> 00:58:47.293
Well, you'd be only one
who can get us there.

845
00:58:47.317 --> 00:58:50.772
- It's a matter of life and death.
- Yeah, that's right, it's a matter
of life and death!

846
00:58:50.796 --> 00:58:53.628
- Yeah, it's... our grandmother.
She's dying.
- Who's dying?

847
00:58:53.658 --> 00:58:57.100
- Our grandmother is dying
and she sent for us.
- Yeah.

848
00:58:57.239 --> 00:59:01.605
Yeah, she's in Rosita Beach, see.
She's dying and we're up here and...

849
00:59:01.635 --> 00:59:04.715
Well, she'd kinda like to have us
be with her when she goes.

850
00:59:04.846 --> 00:59:06.472
Otherwise, she won't go.

851
00:59:06.928 --> 00:59:10.389
- Oh, um, she'll go!
- I'm sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald, but they
forced their way in here.

852
00:59:10.419 --> 00:59:13.408
We didn't force our way in here, sir.
Look, let me introduce myself.

853
00:59:13.438 --> 00:59:15.638
My name is Bell, Dingy Bell.
And this is Benjy Benjamin.

854
00:59:15.679 --> 00:59:18.175
- How do you do?
- Don't start with that "how do you do"!

855
00:59:18.205 --> 00:59:21.791
Look, sir, we-- we'd like you to
help us out by taking us down...

856
00:59:23.385 --> 00:59:25.014
- What's the matter?
- Wait a minute.
- Huh?

857
00:59:25.038 --> 00:59:26.463
Wait a minute. George, come in!

858
00:59:26.824 --> 00:59:29.099
- Yes, I... I can't see!
- What?

859
00:59:29.123 --> 00:59:30.588
Something's happened
to my eyes, I...

860
00:59:30.852 --> 00:59:34.429
- I- I- I can't- can't see!
- You can't see? He can't see.

861
00:59:34.459 --> 00:59:38.475
- Must be an eye cold.
- George! George, I- I- I can't see!

862
00:59:38.505 --> 00:59:40.704
<i>- One minute, Mr. Fitzgerald.</i>
- I can't see!

863
00:59:40.746 --> 00:59:43.282
George! George, I...

864
00:59:46.348 --> 00:59:47.484
Mr. Fitzgerald!

865
00:59:48.807 --> 00:59:50.981
We want to make sure
he doesn't get loose.

866
00:59:53.658 --> 00:59:57.500
I'll kill that dirty rotten bum,
if I get my hands on him.

867
00:59:58.019 --> 00:59:59.446
What's the matter?

868
00:59:59.476 --> 01:00:01.087
How come I'm all tied up like this?

869
01:00:01.117 --> 01:00:03.667
Now listen, you just sit there.
Everything will be all right.

870
01:00:03.697 --> 01:00:06.167
Yeah, a couple of friends are gonna come
and take good care of you.

871
01:00:06.191 --> 01:00:07.515
What friends? What are you
talking about?

872
01:00:07.539 --> 01:00:10.575
Now listen, what's the big idea?
Get this stuff off me. Turn me loose!

873
01:00:10.605 --> 01:00:12.676
Now, take it easy, pal.
'Cause you've been sick.

874
01:00:12.706 --> 01:00:16.106
Who's been sick? And where is
that bum with the glasses, huh?

875
01:00:16.839 --> 01:00:20.100
Now-now-now just sit still,
because the doctor is going to get...

876
01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:23.912
What doctor? I don't know no doctor.
What are you guys, crazy or something?

877
01:00:23.942 --> 01:00:26.781
I'm warning you. Get this
stuff off me, you understand?

878
01:00:26.811 --> 01:00:29.922
- Get this stuff off me!
- Watch him, Ray, WATCH HIM!!

879
01:00:29.952 --> 01:00:33.684
I'm warning you!
I'm going to have to hit you again!

880
01:00:36.409 --> 01:00:38.785
<i>My arm! You broke my arm!</i>

881
01:00:54.035 --> 01:00:58.171
Now, fellas, you keep this up
and I'm gonna get sore. I mean it!

882
01:01:03.218 --> 01:01:07.773
- Okay. That's the way you want it,
that's the way you're going to get it.
<i>- Heeelp! He's gonna...</i>

883
01:01:12.554 --> 01:01:14.341
- I'll kill you!
- Whoo!

884
01:01:18.014 --> 01:01:21.383
- Heeelp! He's ruining our place!
- Come on, Ray!

885
01:01:32.757 --> 01:01:36.176
- You better get out of here, mister!
- Why don't you leave us alone?! AAHH!!

886
01:01:41.261 --> 01:01:44.138
- Uh-huh. There you are.
- What are we going to do?

887
01:01:46.341 --> 01:01:49.266
Dr. Zillman! Dr. Zillman!!

888
01:02:01.077 --> 01:02:03.880
Heeelp! Put me down!
You put me down!

889
01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.773
Put me down immediately!

890
01:02:09.402 --> 01:02:13.912
- That's the way you want it?
You want it that way?!
- Help! HEEEELP!!

891
01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:23.390
- Ray, Ray! Ray! are you all right?
- I'm OK.

892
01:02:27.715 --> 01:02:30.317
He's nuts! He's really hit his head!

893
01:02:31.116 --> 01:02:32.416
<i>I mean it!</i>

894
01:02:32.574 --> 01:02:35.197
- Did you've ever seen
a thing like that before?
- No.

895
01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.198
Holy Jumper! They're
coming back for more.

896
01:02:39.629 --> 01:02:41.679
Look out, you crazy nut!

897
01:02:43.306 --> 01:02:46.400
Guys, you're getting out of line.
I'm not kidding, I've had all I can take!

898
01:02:46.883 --> 01:02:48.921
Irwin, we'll gonna have to kill him.

899
01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.994
- Ready?
- Ready.

900
01:02:51.024 --> 01:02:52.153
- Set?
- Set.

901
01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:53.822
CHAAARGE!!

902
01:03:00.663 --> 01:03:03.462
He's going nuts! He's nuts!
He's really nuts! He's...

903
01:03:03.853 --> 01:03:07.293
- Go away!
- You'd better get out of here!

904
01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:10.777
- I mean it, I don't want to...
- Look out!

905
01:03:13.618 --> 01:03:15.802
Ray, what- what do we do?!

906
01:03:16.455 --> 01:03:18.625
Go away! Go away!

907
01:04:22.996 --> 01:04:26.123
Irwin... Irwiiiin!

908
01:04:26.843 --> 01:04:28.124
Here, Ray.

909
01:04:28.638 --> 01:04:30.125
You fellas all right?

910
01:04:30.926 --> 01:04:34.426
Now they show up. Well, where
were you when we needed you?

911
01:04:34.627 --> 01:04:37.327
- Writing parking tickets, I suppose.
- Yeah.

912
01:04:37.588 --> 01:04:39.205

01:05:40.047 --> 01:05:41.952
I hope you won't mind
my asking of this,

931
01:05:41.976 --> 01:05:44.561
but what sort of chap is this
brother-in-law of yours?

932
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:46.456
He's a nut. Why?

933
01:05:46.707 --> 01:05:49.679
I hope he's nothing like my
brother-in-law. Peculiar ol' chap.

934
01:05:49.709 --> 01:05:52.938
- Secretary of a golf club
out near Pangbourne.
- So what about him?

935
01:05:53.193 --> 01:05:56.833
Just that I was thinking that if Reggie,
that's my brother-in-law,

936
01:05:56.863 --> 01:05:59.998
if Reggie got hold of information
like this information...

937
01:06:00.028 --> 01:06:03.043
...it's likely as not, that would
be the last time...

938
01:06:03.073 --> 01:06:06.200
that anyone would ever see or hear
of dear old Reggie [...].

939
01:06:06.752 --> 01:06:11.872
I got to say, I doubt very much
whether old Reggie will be
waiting for us in Santa Rosita.

940
01:06:13.554 --> 01:06:14.554
Cheers.

941
01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.872
- We're wasting too much time.
- But, Russell, he's bound to be there!

942
01:06:29.902 --> 01:06:31.296
Come on, let's-let's get going.

943
01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.739
Wait a minute!

944
01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:42.268
Are you against calling Sylvester?!

945
01:06:42.606 --> 01:06:46.388
Me? Against Sylvester? Mother...

946
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:54.989
- Now please, let's be reasonable.

947
01:06:55.019 --> 01:06:57.896
- Reasonable? We're gonna settle it,
right now!
- Now look, this doesn't make sense.

948
01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.697
We were back there and we
had a conversation and we
straightened out the whole thing.

949
01:07:00.721 --> 01:07:02.479
- Mr. Hawthorne and I...
- You mean that you two...

950
01:07:02.503 --> 01:07:06.212
- You mean that you suggested that my son...?
- No, Madam, I hastened to <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>- assure you... - Well, if...</u></font>

951
01:07:06.236 --> 01:07:09.542
You think that I'm gonna sit still
while some un-american foreigner...

952
01:07:09.572 --> 01:07:12.504
makes accusations about
my own flesh and blood?

953
01:07:12.534 --> 01:07:14.785
Well, we'll see about that.
Stop this car!

954
01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:18.581
- Really, madam.
- Mother, this is awful!

955
01:07:18.665 --> 01:07:21.360
- So we'll see!
- Mother, what are you doing?!

956
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:24.137
You don't even trust your own
brother-in-law? Well, let me
tell you something.

957
01:07:24.161 --> 01:07:27.260
If my boy is out, then everybody
is out! So we'll see!

958
01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:30.318
Look, we don't even own the car, and
you have no right to do what you do.

959
01:07:30.348 --> 01:07:34.596
Rights?! Rights?! You talk to me
about rights?!

960
01:07:35.538 --> 01:07:39.309
- Mother...
- You address me on the subject
of rights?!

961
01:07:42.689 --> 01:07:44.773
Trouble? Having any trouble?

962
01:07:45.072 --> 01:07:48.235
Yes! And we don't need
any help form you!

963
01:07:54.284 --> 01:07:55.753
Well...

964
01:07:56.036 --> 01:07:59.246
Mother, please. With all due respect,
this is too much.

965
01:07:59.414 --> 01:08:01.549
Give Mr. Hawthorne the keys
or we'll never get there.

966
01:08:01.579 --> 01:08:02.805
Bad! Too bad!

967
01:08:02.835 --> 01:08:07.157
Madam, I must say I find your attitude
somewhat less than helpful.

968
01:08:07.213 --> 01:08:10.924
And what's all this got to do with you,
if you don't mind telling me?!

969
01:08:10.996 --> 01:08:14.774
Well, if we have quite decided
to withdraw from this affair,

970
01:08:14.804 --> 01:08:19.612
you might reasonably be expected to hand
me back my keys so that I could press on.

971
01:08:19.642 --> 01:08:24.080
You keep out of this! Now,
for the last time! Are we going
to call Sylvester or not?

972
01:08:26.119 --> 01:08:27.119
No!

973
01:08:27.484 --> 01:08:31.021
We are not. And I'll tell you why
we're not. Because your son Sylvester

974
01:08:31.051 --> 01:08:35.538
is an irresponsible, unreliable,
big loudmouth, no-good bum,

975
01:08:35.568 --> 01:08:38.139
who, if he isn't a crook,
it's only because he hasn't got

976
01:08:38.169 --> 01:08:40.468
the brains or ambition
even to become a crook.

977
01:08:40.498 --> 01:08:41.789
Say, good show!

978
01:08:41.956 --> 01:08:45.644
Now, If you want to come with us, you
can come with us. But if you don't want
to come with us, you don't have to.

979
01:08:45.668 --> 01:08:47.932
But we've got to get these keys
and you've got to give it to us,

980
01:08:47.956 --> 01:08:49.556
or you'll force us to take them
from you!

981
01:08:49.631 --> 01:08:50.964
Hear, hear.

982
01:08:57.639 --> 01:08:58.959
Give us those keys.

983
01:08:59.889 --> 01:09:00.945
Give us those keys.

984
01:09:00.975 --> 01:09:02.976
<i>I don't care where you have them.
I gonna get 'em!</i>

985
01:09:03.235 --> 01:09:05.345
- How dare you.
- Give us those keys.

986
01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:09.037
- Give us the keys.
- You take one more step towards me...
- I'll take another step.

987
01:09:09.067 --> 01:09:12.858
I'm warning you. You're gonna be sorry!

988
01:09:12.888 --> 01:09:16.136
- Give me the keys.
- You're gonna get it, but good!

989
01:09:17.617 --> 01:09:20.702
- EMELINE!!
- Emeline, stay in the car!

990
01:09:22.088 --> 01:09:23.371
Grab her!

991
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.868
Russell, don't! Mother!

992
01:09:29.212 --> 01:09:32.296
- Put me down!
- Must be stuck.

993
01:09:32.326 --> 01:09:35.370
Russell, you wouldn't.
Oh, you couldn't! You shouldn't!

994
01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:38.253
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me get out of here!

995
01:09:38.283 --> 01:09:41.306
I got 'em! Here, come on!
Here they are.

996
01:09:41.474 --> 01:09:45.978
We really sorry we had to do it.
But that was the only way. Upsy-daisy.

997
01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:48.772
Don't hit him. Ow!

998
01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:55.237
Madam, please! Please!

999
01:09:55.405 --> 01:09:57.252
You forced us. You forced us.

1000
01:09:57.282 --> 01:09:59.455
I'm willing to say I'm sorry,
but you forced us.

1001
01:09:59.485 --> 01:10:01.871
Now, do us a favor, please.
Would you get back in the car?

1002
01:10:01.901 --> 01:10:03.628
Get away from me!
Don't you touch me!

1003
01:10:03.705 --> 01:10:06.582
- We had to do it. You saw it, honey.
- Russell, let me go.

1004
01:10:06.612 --> 01:10:09.305
Just wait. You think you can
manhandle a decent woman!

1005
01:10:09.335 --> 01:10:12.037
You're gonna go to jail!
You're gonna be arrested for assault.

1006
01:10:12.067 --> 01:10:15.757
I'm going to sue for everything you've got!
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF MY DAUGTHER!!

1007
01:10:15.787 --> 01:10:19.816
- I say, look, if we are going,
we really must get cracking.
- Russell, how could you?

1008
01:10:19.846 --> 01:10:21.693
- You know we had to...
- Mr. Finch!

1009
01:10:21.723 --> 01:10:25.561
Please don't go. Please, we'll be right
with you. You see, we had to do it.
She made us do it.

1010
01:10:25.591 --> 01:10:28.199
I... Let's forget the whole thing,
let's be reasonable, please.

1011
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:31.148
- He's gonna leave, would you
please get back in the car.
- Not me!

1012
01:10:31.316 --> 01:10:34.026
We are wasting so much time.
Give me the keys.

1013
01:10:34.584 --> 01:10:37.614
Please, honey, please. If she don't
wanna come, then you got to come.

1014
01:10:37.644 --> 01:10:40.638
I can't leave you here.
You got- you got to make
this choice yourself.

1015
01:10:40.754 --> 01:10:43.927
You gotta stay on my side.
Your place is with me.
You understand, dear?

1016
01:10:43.957 --> 01:10:45.487
- Mama!
- No, wait!

1017
01:10:46.223 --> 01:10:49.352
Alright, go on, go ahead,
you big stupid hooligan!

1018
01:10:49.376 --> 01:10:50.659
Just wait and see what happens!

1019
01:10:50.689 --> 01:10:53.889
Really, old man, I should just
HAVE to say: Tataa!

1020
01:10:54.854 --> 01:10:57.990
Emeline... Emeline!

1021
01:11:21.085 --> 01:11:25.393
The cars are going faster than we
are going. Can't you make this thing
go a little faster?

1022
01:11:25.423 --> 01:11:29.468
Wide open, I can. But wide open
eats up a lot o'gas.

1023
01:11:29.636 --> 01:11:32.304
Then open up wide,
I'll pay extra for the gas!

1024
01:11:32.334 --> 01:11:36.058
- It'll cost you about $50!
- Okay, I'll pay when we land!

1025
01:11:36.088 --> 01:11:38.352
- Now!
- I got to pay you now?!

1026
01:11:38.382 --> 01:11:40.790
- Now!
- All right, I'll pay you now!

1027
01:11:41.541 --> 01:11:42.956
- Melville...
- What?

1028
01:11:42.986 --> 01:11:45.192
A bug! Get him off! Aahh!!

1029
01:11:45.222 --> 01:11:48.987
Get him off! Aahh!
There he is! Get him! Get him!

1030
01:11:49.017 --> 01:11:52.583
- Hey, you're breaking up the airplane!
- Is it down there?!

1031
01:11:53.756 --> 01:11:55.722
Now you're breaking the floor!

1032
01:11:55.752 --> 01:11:57.829
- Aahh! Help!
- Melville!

1033
01:11:57.859 --> 01:11:59.743
Help! Help...

1034
01:12:00.931 --> 01:12:02.988
Everything's okay,
everything's fine.

1035
01:12:03.232 --> 01:12:06.732
Everything's just okay.
Everything is all right.

1036
01:12:07.183 --> 01:12:08.879
Gonna be <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>okay.</u></font>

1037
01:12:09.254 --> 01:12:11.830
None of these 10 people
have any record at all.

1038
01:12:12.417 --> 01:12:15.249
And yet we're ready to book 'em
for withholding information,

1039
01:12:15.279 --> 01:12:18.276
causing accidents,
failing to report accidents,

1040
01:12:18.306 --> 01:12:22.161
reckless driving, theft, at least
three cases of assault and battery...

1041
01:12:22.191 --> 01:12:23.744
- Capt. Culpepper?
- Yeah.

1042
01:12:24.252 --> 01:12:25.677
- That my home?
- Yes, sir.

1043
01:12:26.372 --> 01:12:29.057
Uh, Sheriff, excuse me, will ya?
Another call.

1044
01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:30.522
Take the Sheriff.

1045
01:12:31.226 --> 01:12:32.408
I'll take it in here.

1046
01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.563
Freddy, transfer Mrs. Culpepper
to Culpepper's office.

1047
01:12:38.789 --> 01:12:41.978
- Hello. Ginger?
<i>- Daddy, it's Billie Sue.</i>

1048
01:12:42.182 --> 01:12:44.713
Oh. Let me speak with your mother,
will you, sweetheart?

1049
01:12:48.116 --> 01:12:49.298
<i>Well?</i>

1050
01:12:50.312 --> 01:12:51.591
Ah, dear.

1051
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:53.672
Tell me something, Ginger.

1052
01:12:54.024 --> 01:12:57.380
How does it feel being married
to the most brilliant personality

1053
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:59.320
in the law enforcement industry?

1054
01:12:59.836 --> 01:13:02.213
<i>Are you referring to yourself?</i>

1055
01:13:02.243 --> 01:13:05.981
Ginger, I want you to prepare
yourself for a little shock.

1056
01:13:07.273 --> 01:13:11.741
- When I tell you what has happened here...
- <i>So tell me, tell me. I've got this
biscuit dough...</i>

1057
01:13:11.771 --> 01:13:15.081
The Smiler Grogan case is solved!

1058
01:13:15.354 --> 01:13:16.738
<i>The whaat?</i>

1059
01:13:17.174 --> 01:13:21.395
<i>Now what the hell is
The Smiler Grogan case?</i>

1060
01:13:24.083 --> 01:13:26.290
The tuna factory robbery.

1061
01:13:26.555 --> 01:13:30.010
The case I've been talking about
for the last 15 years!

1062
01:13:30.035 --> 01:13:34.800
Now listen: all I want you to do is
make all the necessary preparations...

1063
01:13:34.825 --> 01:13:37.889
for a little flight to Hawaii,
Sunday morning.

1064
01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:40.877
<i>- So what's the gag?</i>
- It is no gag.

1065
01:13:40.902 --> 01:13:43.959
<i>Are you serious about flying to Hawaii?</i>

1066
01:13:45.927 --> 01:13:48.468
Flight 7, Sunday morning.

1067
01:13:48.538 --> 01:13:50.773
<i>- Are we taking Billie Sue?</i>
- No!

1068
01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:56.843
Just the two of us. For about three weeks.
Now, we're going to celebrate, Ginger.

1069
01:13:57.605 --> 01:14:00.813
My feeling is that after 27 years...

1070
01:14:01.789 --> 01:14:02.816
...we've earned it.

1071
01:14:19.996 --> 01:14:20.996
What's the matter?

1072
01:14:21.334 --> 01:14:23.590
- I need help. Could give me a lift?
- What?

1073
01:14:23.615 --> 01:14:25.430
That's my wife, she's sick, see?

1074
01:14:25.455 --> 01:14:27.624
- The doc sent me out for some medicine.
- Yeah, all right. Come on, come on.

1075
01:14:27.648 --> 01:14:29.398
- I just ran out of gas.
- Get in!

1076
01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.582
What's wrong with your wife?

1077
01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.295
That's the trouble. The doc's not sure.
He says, whatever it is,

1078
01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:40.450
she's too sick, even to be moved.
He needs a special stuff...

1079
01:14:40.751 --> 01:14:43.218
and we haven't got a phone, so I want
to get it, and that's when I ran out of...

1080
01:14:43.242 --> 01:14:45.796
Slow down a little, the turning
is just up here on the right.

1081
01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:46.900
Turning? You mean, it's off the road?

1082
01:14:46.963 --> 01:14:48.900
- Only a mile...
- Oh, pal, I'm in a hurry. I got my...

1083
01:14:48.955 --> 01:14:49.736
HOLD!!

1084
01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.055
Stop the car!

1085
01:14:52.636 --> 01:14:54.156
Now listen, buddy!

1086
01:14:54.227 --> 01:14:56.157
I'm sorry about your problems,

1087
01:14:56.468 --> 01:14:58.858
but the dark side of the hurry,
this is my wife.

1088
01:14:59.189 --> 01:15:02.244
- Now, come on, we turn right here.
- There isn't even a road...

1089
01:15:02.269 --> 01:15:06.650
LISTEN!! Don't force me
to get ROUGH!!

1090
01:15:09.449 --> 01:15:12.256
I'm sorry, I- I didn't mean
to bust up your car.

1091
01:15:12.571 --> 01:15:13.717
It's all right...

1092
01:15:14.923 --> 01:15:16.163
You said, it's a mile?

1093
01:15:17.844 --> 01:15:19.564
Well, I'm asking too much.

1094
01:15:39.349 --> 01:15:40.492
- You?!
- You?!

1095
01:15:40.585 --> 01:15:42.435
Hey, wait a minute. We're in trouble!

1096
01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.977
Everybody's in trouble. Come on,
lady, get out of the way, will ya?

1097
01:15:45.001 --> 01:15:47.325
Do you think we were the ones
who wanted to leave you back there?

1098
01:15:47.349 --> 01:15:49.039
It was my son-in-law
and that Englishman!

1099
01:15:49.064 --> 01:15:51.457
What Englishman? Come on now,
will you get out of the way?

1100
01:15:51.543 --> 01:15:55.136
Look! You leave us here, and you know
what you're going to get out of all this?

1101
01:15:55.287 --> 01:15:57.324
Nothing! My daughter
and I gonna get it all.

1102
01:15:57.492 --> 01:15:58.594
Yeah? How you gonna do that?

1103
01:15:58.618 --> 01:16:01.495
I'm gonna call off my son. He lives
about 10 miles from Rosita Beach.

1104
01:16:01.572 --> 01:16:05.947
And he's gonna drive over there and get
the money, and we're gonna have it,
that's how!

1105
01:16:05.972 --> 01:16:09.419
I was gonna offer you a share
just for taking us to a phone!

1106
01:16:09.504 --> 01:16:13.350
But just because you're not
interested, well, we'll just have to
wait around for another car.

1107
01:16:13.483 --> 01:16:16.333
Is that true? You really got
a brother already down there?

1108
01:16:16.657 --> 01:16:19.354
Yes, it's true. Um... that's true.

1109
01:16:19.405 --> 01:16:22.999
Well, alright, but just remember:
you said I get a share.

1110
01:16:23.190 --> 01:16:25.026
You'll get a share,
you'll get a share.

1111
01:16:26.018 --> 01:16:27.228
Come on, Emeline, get in that truck!

1112
01:16:27.252 --> 01:16:29.675
Mother, for the last time: why don't
we go to the nearest police?

1113
01:16:29.699 --> 01:16:31.261
Oh, I'm glad it's the last time!

1114
01:16:31.615 --> 01:16:35.383
- Say! Where did you get this truck?!
- Well, let's just say I borrowed it, okay?

1115
01:16:35.422 --> 01:16:38.104
Ah, I bet you did.
I just bet you did!

1116
01:16:41.278 --> 01:16:44.491
No, I'm sorry. The nearest place
you could get a wheel for this thing...

1117
01:16:44.553 --> 01:16:47.107
would be in Canyon City, about 45 miles.

1118
01:16:47.348 --> 01:16:48.367
Excuse me.

1119
01:16:48.409 --> 01:16:51.864
45 miles. This bloody machine
will never do it!

1120
01:16:51.903 --> 01:16:54.752
I was just <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>thinking, perhaps ...</u></font>
We're making a terrible mistake.

1121
01:16:54.807 --> 01:16:56.815
We'd better go back and get
my mother-in-law.

1122
01:16:56.846 --> 01:16:58.218
- Go back?
- Yes.

1123
01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:00.611
- Listen, you couldn't be serious.
- Don't you understand?

1124
01:17:00.644 --> 01:17:03.528
All she has to do is get to a telephone,
my brother-in-law will get there first.

1125
01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:07.687
They'll get all and the rest of us won't
get a dime. You can believe that.

1126
01:17:10.982 --> 01:17:12.691
But-but-but look here.

1127
01:17:12.781 --> 01:17:14.545
Even if she does get all the money...

1128
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:17.267
surely, this isn't to make any
difference to our agreement.

1129
01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.239
She wouldn't break her word?

1130
01:17:19.407 --> 01:17:24.119
I-- I mean to say, I-- I'd still be
entitled to 10% as agreed. Surely.

1131
01:17:24.912 --> 01:17:27.383
Surely... Come on, let's go.

1132
01:17:50.563 --> 01:17:53.982
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Santa Rosita 7-1-9-6-5.

1133
01:18:13.859 --> 01:18:15.909
<i>I'm ringing this Santa
Rosita <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>number 7-1-9-6-5.</u></font>.</i>

1134
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:20.573
If Russell really would care anything
about me, he never would left me
the way he did.

1135
01:18:20.947 --> 01:18:24.011
- But he'll come back for me.
- Well now, listen.

1136
01:18:24.485 --> 01:18:27.524
Do you think everybody's been acting
like a bunch of nut-heads or something?

1137
01:18:27.643 --> 01:18:30.414
- I sure do.
- Now let me tell you something.

1138
01:18:30.942 --> 01:18:33.015
Back there, when this
whole thing started,

1139
01:18:33.481 --> 01:18:35.497
I was gonna string along
with everybody,

1140
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:38.516
just to get an equal share.
My share.

1141
01:18:38.617 --> 01:18:39.617
Understand?

1142
01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:41.380
You know what I wanted the money for?

1143
01:18:42.004 --> 01:18:45.605
I want to be in a position to...
do something for Miss Jenkins.

1144
01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:48.295
This little old lady, that runs
a boarding house where I live.

1145
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:53.635
I want to get her, like... well, maybe
a wheelchair with a motor on it,

1146
01:18:53.822 --> 01:18:56.622
Bring her some... some
fresh flowers every day.

1147
01:18:56.723 --> 01:19:01.155
In exchange for looking after me
ever since I was 15 years old.

1148
01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:04.419
That's what I <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>wanted the money for.</u></font>
And what happens next?

1149
01:19:04.676 --> 01:19:06.153
Now, I tell you what happens.

1150
01:19:06.318 --> 01:19:09.198
Then they all decide that I'm
supposed to get a smaller share!

1151
01:19:09.228 --> 01:19:12.402
Like I'm somebody extra-special
stupid or something!

1152
01:19:12.457 --> 01:19:14.608
That they don't even care
what's a democracy!

1153
01:19:14.633 --> 01:19:17.557
Meant in a democracy,
no matter how stupid you are,

1154
01:19:17.604 --> 01:19:20.962
- you still get a equal share!
- I think that's <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>not the right attitude.</u></font>

1155
01:19:20.987 --> 01:19:24.871
And then that dirty, rotten,
slimy bum that double-crossed me.

1156
01:19:24.997 --> 01:19:28.046
When I get a hold of that smart aleck,
what I'm going to do him...

1157
01:19:28.116 --> 01:19:31.165
If you're there, I just hope
that you turn away.

1158
01:19:31.274 --> 01:19:33.789
That's all, that you just
look the other way!

1159
01:19:37.343 --> 01:19:38.578
Well, did you get him?

1160
01:19:38.603 --> 01:19:41.079
Maybe he went out for something,
for the papers or something!

1161
01:19:41.111 --> 01:19:42.560
We can keep on trying!

1162
01:19:42.746 --> 01:19:45.486
Well, just supposing
we never do get him?

1163
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:47.693
Listen, we just might
be the last ones there.

1164
01:20:05.625 --> 01:20:08.752
Just a minute, just a minute!
Down there?

1165
01:20:08.795 --> 01:20:10.711
You must be kidding. It's too steep!

1166
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:13.342
Come on, I drive my Jeep down here
every day. Let's go!

1167
01:20:13.367 --> 01:20:14.674
Yeah, let's go. Let's...

1168
01:20:32.878 --> 01:20:36.432
You can turn around here.
I sure appreciate this, mister. Thanks!

1169
01:20:36.471 --> 01:20:38.198
Yeah, yeah. Swell, yeah.

1170
01:20:42.179 --> 01:20:43.245
Hi, Eddie.

1171
01:21:34.275 --> 01:21:37.949
- Is this Santa Rosita?
- Yep, we're landing in about 12 minutes!

1172
01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:43.806
At least we won, eh? We got here first.
We are the first ones. Oh, boy!

1173
01:21:43.848 --> 01:21:46.631
Honey, the first thing we'll do:
we gonna pick up a shovel.

1174
01:21:46.849 --> 01:21:49.998
No, no, no. First thing,
we get-- we get a taxi!

1175
01:21:50.023 --> 01:21:53.423
- And then we go and pick up a shovel, eh?
- I can't believe it, Melville.

1176
01:21:53.627 --> 01:21:55.533
Yeah... I think, way back...

1177
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:58.675
...I was willing to share and share
alike with them all, you know?

1178
01:21:59.052 --> 01:22:02.229
But not now. Now we get it <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>all!</u></font>

1179
01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:07.950
<i>- Hey, where is the pilot?
- Tyler's probably still in the shower.</i>

1180
01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.554
- Tyler! Oh, Tyler!
- There he is!

1181
01:22:11.022 --> 01:22:13.555
- Tyler! Hey! Hey, Tyler!
- You promised!

1182
01:22:14.116 --> 01:22:16.423
Hey! Now wait, I'll wake him up.

1183
01:22:16.485 --> 01:22:18.548
- Tyler! Tyler!
- Huh?!

1184
01:22:18.758 --> 01:22:21.916
- Tyler! Wake up! Come on now!
- Huh?! Arrgh!!

1185
01:22:22.065 --> 01:22:23.959
Tyler, wake up! Wake up now!

1186
01:22:24.684 --> 01:22:27.176
- Get out of here!
- Hey! Wait! Arrgh!!

1187
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:31.332
Mr. Fitzgerald!
<font color="#FAAAAA"><u>He's out again,</u></font> Benjy!

1188
01:23:12.138 --> 01:23:13.640
Listen, I got to get out of here.

1189
01:23:13.679 --> 01:23:15.347
Would you ask your father
to come out and show me?

1190
01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:17.358
There must be some other
way to get outta here!

1191
01:23:17.443 --> 01:23:18.639
Come on! Hurry up!

1192
01:23:24.670 --> 01:23:28.664
I could show you a way out.
There's another way around to the road.

1193
01:23:28.727 --> 01:23:31.167
Another way? To the road?
You know another way? Good!

1194
01:23:31.192 --> 01:23:32.826
Come on in. Don't stand, just sho...

1195
01:23:32.970 --> 01:23:35.753
Look, you show me how to get
out of here, I'll give you a $1.

1196
01:23:35.824 --> 01:23:38.506
- Hmm... $3!
- $3?! Why, you...

1197
01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.618
Yeah, all right. Give you $3.
But don't stand there!

1198
01:23:41.651 --> 01:23:45.097
Come on, hop in the car! Hurry,
will you, kid?! I gotta get out of here!

1199
01:23:46.208 --> 01:23:47.835
Come on, hop in there! All right.

1200
01:23:48.117 --> 01:23:49.940
- Now, which way is it?
- Around that hill.

1201
01:23:49.971 --> 01:23:51.483
- That way?
- What happened to your door?

1202
01:23:51.507 --> 01:23:53.176
Never mind my door.
This is the way, eh?

1203
01:23:53.377 --> 01:23:55.777
You're a... good little boy.

1204
01:24:14.465 --> 01:24:16.665
- They're not here, they're gone.
- Probably got a lift.

1205
01:24:16.707 --> 01:24:19.427
But we only passed six or seven cars
and they weren't in any of them.

1206
01:24:19.595 --> 01:24:21.589
Somebody must have picked them up
and taken the other way.

1207
01:24:21.613 --> 01:24:23.773
I think we better go back
to that place we phoned from.

1208
01:24:24.263 --> 01:24:26.351
What? That's miles
in the wrong direction.

1209
01:24:26.519 --> 01:24:28.520
Besides, we can't be certain
they'll be there.

1210
01:24:28.688 --> 01:24:31.773
I don't know, I must find my wife.
And I don't know what to do.

1211
01:24:31.941 --> 01:24:33.358
Look, wherever they are,

1212
01:24:33.526 --> 01:24:36.685
surely the most sensible thing
is for the two of us to press on.

1213
01:24:37.029 --> 01:24:40.156
I mean, for all we know, your
brother-in-law may be out
or away, somewhere.

1214
01:24:40.324 --> 01:24:43.951
I mean, even if he were the first
to be there, he still has to find
the money, hasn't he?

1215
01:24:44.146 --> 01:24:47.343
Now I earnestly recommend
that we forget your good ladies,

1216
01:24:47.414 --> 01:24:49.165
and press on with all
possible dispatch.

1217
01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:51.413
All right. We'll press on
with all possible dispatch.

1218
01:24:52.211 --> 01:24:55.218
And I don't really think
that personal rancor...

1219
01:24:55.281 --> 01:24:58.466
is going to help the situation...
if I may say so.

1220
01:25:20.823 --> 01:25:24.242
Okay, come on, honey.
Let's go. We're here.

1221
01:25:24.333 --> 01:25:25.834
We got here first, let's go.

1222
01:25:25.859 --> 01:25:28.896
Come on. Oh, I got you,
I got you. I got you.

1223
01:25:29.039 --> 01:25:30.206
Attaboy, baby.

1224
01:25:30.374 --> 01:25:32.375
We've made it, we're here first,
we can...

1225
01:25:32.543 --> 01:25:34.813
Look, will you take care of my car
until we get back, right?

1226
01:25:34.837 --> 01:25:35.957
Come on, let's go.

1227
01:25:35.982 --> 01:25:38.667
Come on, let's, go. Will you GO?!
Come on, honey!

1228
01:25:45.389 --> 01:25:46.806
<i>Over there?</i>

1229
01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:48.725
<i>THERE?!</i>

1230
01:25:49.518 --> 01:25:51.060
DOWN THERE?!

1231
01:26:23.844 --> 01:26:25.470
That'll be $ 2.90.

1232
01:26:25.638 --> 01:26:29.599
$ 2.90? Here, here's $ 3.00.
Keep the change, but wait for us, okay?

1233
01:26:29.663 --> 01:26:31.100
Oh, sure.

1234
01:26:31.644 --> 01:26:33.940
Wise guy. Come on, let's go.

1235
01:26:34.897 --> 01:26:37.680
- Oh, no, we're closed. It's 12:00.
- It's 12:00. They're closed.

1236
01:26:37.743 --> 01:26:38.743
Wait a minute!

1237
01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:41.761
All we want is a
pick and a shovel!

1238
01:26:42.321 --> 01:26:43.780
Mr. Dinkler's inside.

1239
01:26:43.948 --> 01:26:46.427
Dinkler! That's it, we'll get Dinkler,
that's all. Come on.

1240
01:26:53.605 --> 01:26:56.105
Aah! Downstairs, eh? Come on.

1241
01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:58.736
They must be here someplace.
Down here, yeah.

1242
01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:03.293
Look, look for a pick and
a shovel, all right?

1243
01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.240
Pick and a shovel, must be...
someplace around.

1244
01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:07.619
That's all I need.

1245
01:27:08.227 --> 01:27:09.364
That's all I need, boy.

1246
01:27:09.739 --> 01:27:12.870
That's all I need, a pick
and a shovel. I found it!

1247
01:27:19.549 --> 01:27:21.258
Got it! Heh...

1248
01:27:21.426 --> 01:27:23.614
- It's just...
- I got it! I found it!

1249
01:27:25.668 --> 01:27:26.668
Oh...

1250
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:32.468
I don't wish to quarrel
with you, Finch,

1251
01:27:32.493 --> 01:27:35.624
but speaking as a representative
of Her Majesty's Armed Forces,

1252
01:27:35.649 --> 01:27:38.435
- ...I take the most particular exception...
- You want me to tell you something?

1253
01:27:38.459 --> 01:27:40.606
- You want me to tell you something?
As far as I'm concerned,

1254
01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:42.470
the whole British race
is practically finished.

1255
01:27:42.718 --> 01:27:44.315
If it hadn't been for 'land-lease',

1256
01:27:44.387 --> 01:27:46.012
we hadn't kept your
whole country afloat

1257
01:27:46.054 --> 01:27:48.857
by giving you billions, that you
never even said 'Thank you' for,

1258
01:27:49.025 --> 01:27:52.129
the whole phony outfit would be sunk
right under the Atlantic years ago.

1259
01:27:54.113 --> 01:27:57.532
- Hey! What are you stopping for?
- Get out of this machine!

1260
01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:59.593
Get out? I- I can't--
You're crazy...

1261
01:27:59.639 --> 01:28:02.033
My machine, I'll do as I
bloody well please. Out!

1262
01:28:02.104 --> 01:28:05.332
I- I'm awfully sorry. I... You know,
I've been very edgy today.

1263
01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.072
If I said anything about England,
I apologize.

1264
01:28:08.713 --> 01:28:10.369
Glad to hear you say so.

1265
01:28:10.922 --> 01:28:15.158
I must say, if I had the grievous
misfortune to be a citizen of this
benighted country,

1266
01:28:15.218 --> 01:28:19.368
I should be most hesitant in offering
any criticism whatever of any other.

1267
01:28:19.431 --> 01:28:21.264
Wait a minute. Are you
mocking this country?

1268
01:28:21.432 --> 01:28:23.286
Are you saying something
against America?

1269
01:28:23.726 --> 01:28:28.146
Against it? I should be positively
astounded to hear anything said for it.

1270
01:28:28.314 --> 01:28:31.199
Why, the whole bloody place
is the most unspeakable matriarchy...

1271
01:28:31.275 --> 01:28:32.755
in the whole history of civilization!

1272
01:28:32.902 --> 01:28:36.738
Look at yourself! And the way your wife
and her strumpet of a mother...

1273
01:28:36.906 --> 01:28:38.323
push you through the hoop.

1274
01:28:38.491 --> 01:28:41.410
As far as I can see, American men
have been totally emasculated.

1275
01:28:41.577 --> 01:28:42.661
They're like slaves.

1276
01:28:42.829 --> 01:28:45.228
They die like flies,
from coronary thrombosis,

1277
01:28:45.322 --> 01:28:48.166
while their women sit under
hair dryers eating chocolates,

1278
01:28:48.334 --> 01:28:52.546
and arranging for every second Tuesday
to be some sort of Mother's Day.

1279
01:28:52.714 --> 01:28:56.396
And this positively infantile
preoccupation with bosoms.

1280
01:28:56.718 --> 01:28:58.939
In all my time in this wretched,
godforsaken country,

1281
01:28:58.986 --> 01:29:03.265
the one thing that has appalled me
most of all is this preposterous
preoccupation with bosoms!

1282
01:29:03.433 --> 01:29:06.544
Don't you realise that they've become
the dominant theme in American culture!

1283
01:29:06.599 --> 01:29:09.938
In literature, advertising, in all--
feel the day, within everything!

1284
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.857
I'll wager you anything you like,

1285
01:29:11.969 --> 01:29:14.531
if American women stopped
wearing brassieres...

1286
01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:18.425
your whole national economy
would collapse, overnight!

1287
01:29:19.448 --> 01:29:21.645
<i>F-7 to Central. The Crumps are locked...</i>

1288
01:29:21.701 --> 01:29:24.758
<i>in the hardware store basement.
Shall I let them out? Over.</i>

1289
01:29:24.845 --> 01:29:27.483
How the hell could they get themselves
locked in a basement?

1290
01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:29.608
- We better let them out.
- That ain't fair.

1291
01:29:30.710 --> 01:29:34.337
- It ain't fair? What ain't fair?
- If they got themselves in there,

1292
01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.386
they ought to be able
to get themselves out.

1293
01:29:36.465 --> 01:29:40.631
Uh... after all, if you help them,
you're not being fair to the others.

1294
01:29:41.179 --> 01:29:44.984
But... the moment anybody gets to where
they're going, we're gonna pick 'em up!

1295
01:29:45.083 --> 01:29:47.558
So, what difference does it make
who gets there first?

1296
01:29:47.583 --> 01:29:48.846
Aahh... it's a race, ain't it?

1297
01:29:49.103 --> 01:29:50.703
Why do you want to help
that dentist for?

1298
01:29:50.749 --> 01:29:55.067
Me? I've been pulling all the way
for that other guy, Pike, with the
furniture van.

1299
01:29:55.234 --> 01:29:57.152
The rules oughtta be
the same for everybody.

1300
01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.986
Otherwise, it just ain't fair.

1301
01:30:07.476 --> 01:30:09.015
Central to F-7.

1302
01:30:10.015 --> 01:30:13.502
No. We'll leave 'em where
they are. See what happens.

1303
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:17.172
Watch all the exits, but render
no assistance. Over.

1304
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.199
Are you happy?

1305
01:31:14.257 --> 01:31:15.858
Can't you do it, Melville?

1306
01:31:21.419 --> 01:31:24.788
Don't you think... I would,
if I could?

1307
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:29.697
I'm trying. I'm trying very hard.

1308
01:31:35.638 --> 01:31:37.118
You know what I need? I need a drink,

1309
01:31:37.153 --> 01:31:40.342
there's some ice-and-stuff
back there. Why don't you
make us all some Ol'Fashions?

1310
01:31:40.366 --> 01:31:42.727
Ol'Fashions? You think you ought
to drink while you're flying?

1311
01:31:42.751 --> 01:31:44.784
Well, stop kidding and quickly
make us some drinks.

1312
01:31:44.839 --> 01:31:47.723
You just press the button
back there, marked "Booze."

1313
01:31:49.157 --> 01:31:53.347
- It's the only way to fly. Ha-ha...
- He-he-he...

1314
01:32:06.516 --> 01:32:11.448
Estimated speed: 1-7-5.
We'll never be able to keep up with him.

1315
01:32:12.021 --> 01:32:15.273
Better have some of the other
units intercept. Over.

1316
01:32:16.859 --> 01:32:18.985
Hello, Ginger? What's the matter now?

1317
01:32:19.153 --> 01:32:22.405
<i>It's Billie Sue. Her new
boyfriend Oscar</i>

1318
01:32:22.472 --> 01:32:25.909
<i>was supposed to come down
from Pomona just to meet us.</i>

1319
01:32:25.977 --> 01:32:28.745
<i>- So now she called him and
told him we were going away.</i>
- What?

1320
01:32:28.913 --> 01:32:30.259
So? What's the matter?

1321
01:32:30.321 --> 01:32:34.030
<i>You keep forgetting, if a girl
is 6 feet 5 inches tall,</i>

1322
01:32:34.093 --> 01:32:36.517
<i>she's bound to have special problems.</i>

1323
01:32:36.546 --> 01:32:38.421
- But, Ginger...
<i>- They had some argument...</i>

1324
01:32:38.589 --> 01:32:39.598
- Get out!
- <i>and they started</i>

1325
01:32:39.622 --> 01:32:42.622
<i>screaming at each other
and now the whole engagement's off,</i>

1326
01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:44.427
<i>and she says she's leaving.</i>

1327
01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:46.734
Leaving what? Leaving home?

1328
01:32:46.945 --> 01:32:49.299
Let-- let me talk to her.
Get her to the phone!

1329
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:51.935
<i>I'll try. Just a minute.
Talk to your father.</i>

1330
01:32:52.103 --> 01:32:54.855
<i>I won't. I don't want
to talk to him ever!</i>

1331
01:32:55.022 --> 01:32:58.834
<i>Don't be ridiculous. Whatever
else he is, he is your father.</i>

1332
01:32:58.876 --> 01:33:00.796
Captain, there is a captive report.
Just came in.

1333
01:33:00.838 --> 01:33:03.520
All right! All right! In a minute!
Can you wait a minute?

1334
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:06.215
<i>- ...talk to your father.
- No! No! No!</i>
- What?!

1335
01:33:06.270 --> 01:33:08.718
<i>- She won't come to the phone.</i>
- She... what?

1336
01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:12.653
<i>- She won't come to the phone.</i>
- Look, you are her mother!
Get her to the phone!

1337
01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:43.431
- Mel! Are you all right?
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1338
01:33:45.302 --> 01:33:47.532
Look at this. Just another storeroom.

1339
01:33:49.882 --> 01:33:50.933
Dynamite!

1340
01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.634
Dynamite.

1341
01:33:55.135 --> 01:33:56.335
We could blow our way out.

1342
01:33:56.626 --> 01:34:01.172
Melville, you don't know anything
about dynamite and you know
how I hate explosions!

1343
01:34:01.227 --> 01:34:04.347
Look, I've seen many people
blowing tree stumps out with
just a little dynamite.

1344
01:34:04.377 --> 01:34:08.039
It's simple: you just light it and it
goes boom. That's all. It's...

1345
01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:11.640
<i>The burglar alarm.</i>

1346
01:34:12.631 --> 01:34:15.761
We just throw it on, people hear it,
they come and we're out.

1347
01:34:16.002 --> 01:34:18.691
Okay, now, don't be frightened if it
makes a big bell noise, you know.

1348
01:34:18.715 --> 01:34:20.621
Okay. All right? Here we go.

1349
01:34:25.544 --> 01:34:28.644
- I don't hear anything.
- Neither do I. There's no bell.

1350
01:34:33.702 --> 01:34:35.545
Look at it. It just stands there!

1351
01:34:37.346 --> 01:34:38.346
Wait a minute.

1352
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.800
Stand by.

1353
01:34:56.792 --> 01:34:58.263
Burglar alarm.

1354
01:34:58.661 --> 01:35:02.009
Burglar alarm! The stupidest burglar
in the world could come in here

1355
01:35:02.051 --> 01:35:04.291
and walk away with everything!
And we can't even GET OUT!

1356
01:35:15.421 --> 01:35:16.759
I was just thinking.

1357
01:35:19.752 --> 01:35:21.852
<i>Melville. Mel!</i>

1358
01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:26.112
Even if you do get the bell to ring
and somebody comes...

1359
01:35:27.112 --> 01:35:28.754
...what about the damage?

1360
01:35:29.055 --> 01:35:31.055
Won't they make you pay
for the damage?

1361
01:35:31.956 --> 01:35:33.256
Damage?

1362
01:35:34.607 --> 01:35:36.857
Make us pay <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>for the damage?!</u></font>

1363
01:35:38.508 --> 01:35:40.858
They're the ones who
LOCKED US IN!!

1364
01:35:42.829 --> 01:35:44.859
This thing is gotta work!

1365
01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:58.160
Help me! Help me, please!

1366
01:35:58.461 --> 01:35:59.909
Please, help me, Monica!

1367
01:35:59.995 --> 01:36:02.560
I lo- I love you, Monica!

1368
01:36:02.585 --> 01:36:04.630
Please, help me! I'm frying!

1369
01:36:05.803 --> 01:36:07.663
Please, help me! Oh...

1370
01:36:15.104 --> 01:36:16.364
Melville!

1371
01:37:04.890 --> 01:37:06.681
You hear bells, baby?

1372
01:37:11.333 --> 01:37:12.333
Yes?

1373
01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:15.155
<i>- Who is that? Who is that?</i>
- Who's that?

1374
01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:17.485
I want my son! Hey!

1375
01:37:19.534 --> 01:37:23.211
Who is that? I want to speak
to Sylvester Marcus.

1376
01:37:23.909 --> 01:37:25.911
- Sylvester?
- Yeah, baby?

1377
01:37:26.724 --> 01:37:28.888
- It's your Mom.
- Ha-ha-ha...

1378
01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:34.182
Ha-ha, good old Mom. HELLOO!!

1379
01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:37.035
- Sylvester? Sylvester?!
<i>- Is that you, Mom?</i>

1380
01:37:37.153 --> 01:37:39.707
'Course it's me! I've been trying
to get to you all morning!

1381
01:37:39.762 --> 01:37:41.686
I've been a little busy, Mom,
I've been...

1382
01:37:42.522 --> 01:37:45.202
I've been working, Mom,
and I didn't hear the phone.

1383
01:37:45.373 --> 01:37:47.055
Hey, hold on a minute, will you, Mom?

1384
01:37:47.495 --> 01:37:51.255
Baby, how about a can o'beer
or something, eh? Man, I feel like...

1385
01:37:51.294 --> 01:37:53.780
Sylvester, will you listen?
Something's happened!

1386
01:37:53.827 --> 01:37:56.847
<i>There was an accident this morning.
A man got killed!</i>

1387
01:37:57.526 --> 01:37:58.449
Who, Mom? Who got killed?

1388
01:37:58.488 --> 01:38:00.247
<i>- Now, listen! Listen...</i>
- Hey, you all right?

1389
01:38:00.271 --> 01:38:01.638
<i>- Pay attention!</i>
- Sis all right?

1390
01:38:01.663 --> 01:38:03.532
<i>- Sylvester, will you listen?</i>
- What's the matter, Mom?

1391
01:38:03.556 --> 01:38:05.274
<i>Sylvester, can you hear me?!</i>

1392
01:38:05.321 --> 01:38:07.260
There's a whole fortune in cash,

1393
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:10.643
and you can get it before anybody
gets it, but you've got to hurry,
do you hear?!

1394
01:38:10.744 --> 01:38:14.004
What's the matter, Mom, eh? Now,
what's going on here? Are you all right?

1395
01:38:14.075 --> 01:38:16.796
Of course I'm all right!
SYLVESTEEER!!

1396
01:38:16.843 --> 01:38:18.228
Are Russell and Emeline with you?

1397
01:38:18.306 --> 01:38:22.440
Sylvester, forget about Russell. Will you
just shut up AND LET ME TALK?!!

1398
01:38:22.494 --> 01:38:24.910
Mom, come on now, what's going on?
And where is Russell?

1399
01:38:24.996 --> 01:38:26.684
Don't even mention Russell!

1400
01:38:26.723 --> 01:38:29.873
- When I tell you what Russell did...
- Just tell him about the dough, will ya?

1401
01:38:30.264 --> 01:38:32.178
Will you keep out of this
and shut up?!

1402
01:38:32.248 --> 01:38:34.875
<i>- Sylvester, don't talk, just listen.</i>
- What did Russell do?

1403
01:38:34.961 --> 01:38:38.575
He assaulted me, if you wanna know!
He grabbed me right beside the road!

1404
01:38:38.742 --> 01:38:41.142
He, and this Englishman
I don't even KNOW!!

1405
01:38:41.197 --> 01:38:43.877
Hey, Mom, who is with you? Who
are you talking to and where are you?

1406
01:38:43.989 --> 01:38:47.150
I'm with this truck driver in Peterson's
Garage, in a place called Plaster City.

1407
01:38:47.388 --> 01:38:50.279
And will you shut up a minute so I can
tell you WHAT HAPPENED?!

1408
01:38:50.321 --> 01:38:51.496
Now listen, Mom, you
listen to me close!

1409
01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.737
You stay right there, 'cause I'm coming
now. I'm coming to get you right now.

1410
01:38:54.815 --> 01:38:55.981
WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN!

1411
01:38:56.012 --> 01:38:57.973
Mom, it's all right, everything's
gonna be all right, Mom.

1412
01:38:57.997 --> 01:38:59.489
Your baby's coming to get you.

1413
01:38:59.535 --> 01:39:02.307
- You just sit there, sit there.
Relax, take it easy.
<i>- Sylvesteeer!</i>

1414
01:39:02.365 --> 01:39:03.833
- I'm coming to get you, Mom.
- SHUT UP AND LET ME...!!!

1415
01:39:03.857 --> 01:39:05.137
Everything's gonna be all right.

1416
01:39:05.434 --> 01:39:08.094
It' my Mom, now she... she's
going crazy or something!

1417
01:39:08.995 --> 01:39:11.053
MAYBE RAPED!! OH!!

1418
01:39:15.812 --> 01:39:17.020
Well?

1419
01:39:17.855 --> 01:39:19.489
So he's coming here.

1420
01:39:19.773 --> 01:39:22.091
And I'm not to worry about a thing.

1421
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:24.547
Because "everything is gonna
be all right".

1422
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:30.655
EXACTLY LIKE YOUR FATHER!! A BIG,
STUPID, MUSCLE-HEADED MORON!!

1423
01:39:30.811 --> 01:39:35.485
I tell you, he's exactly like your father!
- Oh, mother, how can you say a thing
like that about your own...

1424
01:39:35.547 --> 01:39:39.509
What are you just standing there for?!
Come on, what are we waiting for?!
Let's get going!!

1425
01:39:43.851 --> 01:39:47.212
- What do you think you're doing?
- I gotta pick your car!

1426
01:39:47.272 --> 01:39:48.696
You can't take my car!

1427
01:39:48.738 --> 01:39:50.381
- It's my mother!
- It's my husband's!

1428
01:39:50.503 --> 01:39:52.349
- It's my mother!
- What will my husband say?

1429
01:39:52.388 --> 01:39:54.467
- He's going to leave you!
- Sylvester!

1430
01:39:54.514 --> 01:39:57.129
- I'm coming, Mama!
- SYLVESTEEER!!

1431
01:40:06.006 --> 01:40:10.306
<i>You better have to make up a story,
it's something to tell them.</i>

1432
01:40:11.537 --> 01:40:14.007
<i>If they see this damage, you're done!</i>

1433
01:40:26.008 --> 01:40:27.008
Come on!

1434
01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:31.486
Look, I was here first! I got here
first, ahead of all of 'em!

1435
01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:36.278
I got the plane! I had the whole thing
right in the palm of my hand...

1436
01:40:36.451 --> 01:40:39.311
And all I needed was a pick
and a shovel!

1437
01:40:46.312 --> 01:40:48.134
What are you staring at?

1438
01:40:49.403 --> 01:40:50.494
A blowtorch.

1439
01:40:51.994 --> 01:40:54.014
I could burn our way outta here.

1440
01:40:54.215 --> 01:40:56.415
I could burn the lock
right outta that door.

1441
01:41:03.843 --> 01:41:05.593
Don't make them so sweet this time.

1442
01:41:05.761 --> 01:41:08.949
You want another one? You've had
two already. Can't you wait till we're
on the ground?

1443
01:41:08.973 --> 01:41:11.558
What are you talking about?
I'll armour the next batch.

1444
01:41:11.725 --> 01:41:13.016
You- you take the controls.

1445
01:41:13.157 --> 01:41:16.930
- I- I don't know how to fly an airplane.
- Well, there's really nothing,
nothing to it.

1446
01:41:17.022 --> 01:41:21.008
- But Benjy- Be-Benjy can't fly!
- Well, that's nonsense. Anybody
can fly a plane.

1447
01:41:21.071 --> 01:41:24.726
I'm here, now I'll- I'll - I'll check
you out. Put your little hands
on the wheel.

1448
01:41:24.859 --> 01:41:27.759
Ah, that's it. Now you have it.
Now the feet on the rudder, you got it?

1449
01:41:27.825 --> 01:41:29.865
There you are, feet on the rudder,
that's nuts, heh?

1450
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:32.842
Who says this boy can't fly this
ol' plane?! Now, there you go.

1451
01:41:33.289 --> 01:41:35.775
Now I'm gonna make an old-fashionedly
Old-Fashioned the way that...

1452
01:41:35.799 --> 01:41:37.853
...the way that dear old Dad used to!

1453
01:41:38.127 --> 01:41:39.669
Wha- what if something happens?!

1454
01:41:39.837 --> 01:41:42.422
What can happen to an
Old Fashioned, all right?

1455
01:41:44.061 --> 01:41:48.524
Hey, Benjy, I know you don't know what
to do, or anything, so don't do nothing!

1456
01:41:48.579 --> 01:41:52.765
- I won't do nothing.
- I say, that boy's a natural-born flyer,
that's all.

1457
01:42:03.277 --> 01:42:06.654
Wait a minute. Benjy! Benjy!
Ease- ease back on 'er!

1458
01:42:06.822 --> 01:42:08.808
- I'm easing!
- Just like I say, ease back a little bit!

1459
01:42:08.832 --> 01:42:12.201
- I'm trying my best!
- All kidding aside...

1460
01:42:12.369 --> 01:42:14.421
I'm not kidding any longer,
It's making me...

1461
01:42:14.869 --> 01:42:18.855
...NERVOUS!! Hey! We've got
an accident back here!

1462
01:42:18.918 --> 01:42:20.501
- What happened?
- I don't know!

1463
01:42:21.572 --> 01:42:24.702
- Whatever it, I'll find out!
- What happened?
- Wait a minute!

1464
01:42:24.933 --> 01:42:27.669
Mr. Fitzgerald! Mr. Fitzgerald!

1465
01:42:29.184 --> 01:42:31.506
- Hey, Benjy!
- Whaaat?

1466
01:42:31.625 --> 01:42:34.425
You won't believe it, but he's hit
his head! He's knocked himself cold!

1467
01:42:34.494 --> 01:42:37.006
- Do something! Do something!
- What can I do?

1468
01:42:37.048 --> 01:42:38.925
- Throw water on him!
- Throw water on...

1469
01:42:39.027 --> 01:42:40.608
Yeah! Yeah!

1470
01:42:42.179 --> 01:42:43.509
NOT ON ME!!

1471
01:42:52.583 --> 01:42:55.627
It's good that truck pulled over.
I can't stand this anymore.

1472
01:42:56.039 --> 01:42:59.631
- In the name of reason,
pull yourself together!
- You were 10 feet over the line.

1473
01:43:39.463 --> 01:43:43.027
Oh! So it's fisticuffs you want, is it?!
Right! Stick'em up!

1474
01:43:43.113 --> 01:43:45.135
- No! No!
- Come here! Come here, you coward!

1475
01:43:45.302 --> 01:43:47.178
- Come here!
- No! Don't hit me!

1476
01:43:47.242 --> 01:43:49.222
- Stop, you!
- Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

1477
01:43:53.477 --> 01:43:56.563
- Blood!
- It certainly is.

1478
01:43:58.524 --> 01:44:00.608
Come back here, you blimey...

1479
01:44:05.156 --> 01:44:07.697
You want to play dirty, huh? Okay!

1480
01:44:11.704 --> 01:44:12.909
Foul! Foul!

1481
01:44:12.997 --> 01:44:16.958
You're not much good without
that horrible mother-in-law
of yours, are you? Ha-ha-ha...

1482
01:44:20.421 --> 01:44:21.853
Hey, come on. Fight!

1483
01:44:22.339 --> 01:44:24.079
You thought you had me, didn't you?

1484
01:44:24.118 --> 01:44:26.384
I have you! I'll kill you! I swear!

1485
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:31.313
No! Stop! Please!
No, no, please, oh...

1486
01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:47.046
- Hello! Hello! Hello there...
- Don't shut the motor off!

1487
01:44:47.155 --> 01:44:50.408
I'm not shutting anything off! Hello!
Hello, anybody! Can anybody hear me?

1488
01:44:50.593 --> 01:44:54.180
- I can hear you!
- I don't care if you hear me or not!

1489
01:44:54.205 --> 01:44:55.164
Look, I wanna be...

1490
01:44:55.206 --> 01:44:58.625
- I don't know whether we're
on the air or not...
- Mayday! You gotta call MAYDAY!!

1491
01:44:58.793 --> 01:45:02.879
Mayday! Mayday, we're up here!
Can you hear us? Help! Help!

1492
01:45:03.047 --> 01:45:07.377
- Benjy, say something.
- HELP!! HEEELP!!

1493
01:45:08.087 --> 01:45:10.297
Your daughter, sir, she's
on the other line, and...

1494
01:45:10.428 --> 01:45:12.498
...I think there's something <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>wrong.</u></font>

1495
01:45:13.098 --> 01:45:15.141
Hello? Billie Sue?

1496
01:45:15.309 --> 01:45:18.137
- Billie Sue, where are you?
<i>- I'm at the bus station.</i>

1497
01:45:18.187 --> 01:45:20.908
<i>I only called because
Mommy said I absolutely...</i>

1498
01:45:21.357 --> 01:45:24.609
Now, Billie Sue, sweetie, wha-- what
are you doing in the bus station?

1499
01:45:24.777 --> 01:45:26.678
<i>I'm waiting for the bus.</i>

1500
01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:29.879
Oh, now, sweetie, would you
just listen to me for a minute?

1501
01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.353
Billie Sue, now try to understand:

1502
01:45:32.683 --> 01:45:35.581
When this things started-- now, honestly,
I don't know what happened...

1503
01:45:35.872 --> 01:45:38.241
...but all I wanted to do is to celebrate!

1504
01:45:38.283 --> 01:45:41.583
<i>Well, I don't gonna see what
this has to do with that.</i>

1505
01:45:42.031 --> 01:45:46.624
No, well, no, never mind that, because
what I want you to do is just turn in
your ticket...

1506
01:45:46.825 --> 01:45:50.637
and then get in a cab and go home
right away and just wait till I can
get there.

1507
01:45:51.053 --> 01:45:53.251
Now, will you do that for me,
sweetheart? Oh, ple...

1508
01:45:53.917 --> 01:45:58.427
...will you-will you, please, do that
one little thing <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>for me, sweetheart?</u></font>

1509
01:45:58.801 --> 01:46:00.897
Your wife. She's on the other phone.

1510
01:46:01.569 --> 01:46:03.019
- Ginger?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1511
01:46:03.089 --> 01:46:05.578
Now listen, Ginger, I've got
Billie Sue on the other line.

1512
01:46:05.679 --> 01:46:07.915
Um, Billie Sue, just wait
one minute, will you?

1513
01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:10.201
- Ginger?
<i>- I'm here.</i>

1514
01:46:10.287 --> 01:46:12.834
Ginger, can you hear Billie Sue?
She's crying.

1515
01:46:12.904 --> 01:46:13.707
<i>Billie Sue!</i>

1516
01:46:13.749 --> 01:46:15.949
She's in the bus station
and she's crying!

1517
01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:17.881
But she's waiting for you
to tell her.

1518
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:20.398
<i>- Billie Sue!</i>
- Billie Sue, are you- are you listening?

1519
01:46:20.492 --> 01:46:21.492
<i>Billie?</i>

1520
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:24.995
- Are you listening to your mother?
<i>- Billie Sue, your mother is speaking.</i>

1521
01:46:25.073 --> 01:46:28.114
- Listen to your mother, sweetie.
<i>- Billie Sue!</i>

1522
01:46:28.419 --> 01:46:30.731
Billie Sue, LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER!!

1523
01:46:35.623 --> 01:46:38.929
Listen, let me tell you something!
Everything that's happened to my
daughter and me today,

1524
01:46:38.953 --> 01:46:41.653
only happened for one reason!
And that was because you were
too stupid

1525
01:46:41.677 --> 01:46:44.756
to look where you were going, and
wrecked our car in the first place!

1526
01:46:44.952 --> 01:46:46.061
Oh, yeah?!

1527
01:46:56.483 --> 01:46:59.641
All right, now you either get out
of that truck or I'm going to
throw you out of that truck!

1528
01:46:59.665 --> 01:47:01.253
Oh, please, Mr. Pike, don't get upset.

1529
01:47:01.378 --> 01:47:04.940
You're not going to do anything!
Drive on, you big, stupid idiot.

1530
01:47:05.212 --> 01:47:08.054
I'll bet you anything it was
her idea right back there

1531
01:47:08.124 --> 01:47:10.437
to pass me by on that bicycle,
now, wasn't it? Hm?

1532
01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:13.638
Yeah, well, I'm beginning to realize
what your husbands been going through.

1533
01:47:13.662 --> 01:47:15.605
Well, I've had it ust about up to here.

1534
01:47:15.847 --> 01:47:18.372
Come on, lady, I'm talking
to you. Get out of the truck!

1535
01:47:18.505 --> 01:47:20.529
Well, I'm getting though. Excuse me.

1536
01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:22.840
I'm not!

1537
01:47:23.881 --> 01:47:25.389
I'm not even moving!

1538
01:47:25.467 --> 01:47:28.227
I've got as much right as you got
to be in this truck!

1539
01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:31.612
Because you stole it and that's the
first thing I'm gonna tell the police,

1540
01:47:31.679 --> 01:47:35.540
if you don't get back in this truck,
and drive us to Rosita Beach State Park!

1541
01:47:35.965 --> 01:47:38.290
Mommy, you're not to worry
about your baby!

1542
01:47:39.133 --> 01:47:41.511
Your baby's coming to save you, Mama!

1543
01:47:45.569 --> 01:47:48.685
Oh! Mr. Pike! Mr. Pike, please!

1544
01:47:48.755 --> 01:47:51.889
- Let me go! Get away from me!
- That isn't nice a bit!!

1545
01:47:52.856 --> 01:47:55.545
- Mother!
- That isn't a nice way to pick up a shoe!

1546
01:47:56.819 --> 01:47:58.666
Please, help me!

1547
01:48:05.167 --> 01:48:07.467
- Oooh!
- Stop the car!

1548
01:48:07.663 --> 01:48:11.249
Your baby, that's what I'm here for.
That's why you had me, Mama,
to save you!

1549
01:48:12.876 --> 01:48:14.925
Help me! AAAAHH!!

1550
01:48:15.301 --> 01:48:17.528
EMELINE! HEELP!!

1551
01:48:18.322 --> 01:48:19.626
Yeah, yeah.

1552
01:48:22.886 --> 01:48:24.345
It's practically burned through!

1553
01:48:24.513 --> 01:48:27.140
Now, just a couple of blows with
the sledgehammer, and we're out!

1554
01:48:48.450 --> 01:48:49.801
Why now, stand back!

1555
01:49:02.899 --> 01:49:05.708
Hey! Wait a minute!

1556
01:49:06.555 --> 01:49:08.227
I can't cross here!

1557
01:49:08.354 --> 01:49:11.930
You said the main road.
This is Niagara Falls.

1558
01:49:12.419 --> 01:49:13.419
All right, look.

1559
01:49:14.072 --> 01:49:15.009
You're a little boy.

1560
01:49:15.063 --> 01:49:18.378
If you want to be a big boy...
which way to the main road?!

1561
01:49:27.933 --> 01:49:29.958
Don't! Don't!

1562
01:49:31.023 --> 01:49:32.314
Get off!

1563
01:49:33.015 --> 01:49:35.315
- Let-- let go!
<i>- I won't let you!</i>

1564
01:49:36.816 --> 01:49:39.513
<i>- Get me-- get me out of here!</i>
- Take your own pension!

1565
01:49:44.121 --> 01:49:45.938
Now, that's enough. That's enough!

1566
01:49:48.795 --> 01:49:49.918
Thought you had me, eh?

1567
01:49:50.139 --> 01:49:51.941
Thought you had me?! Come on!

1568
01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:56.720
Captain! I am sorry.
The Chief wants to see you.

1569
01:49:56.971 --> 01:50:00.080
- You wouldn't believe it.
You couldn't believe it!
- What?

1570
01:50:00.122 --> 01:50:03.328
I'm telling you, I've never been [...]
so disgusted in my whole life!

1571
01:50:03.641 --> 01:50:05.978
It's no! The answer is 'No'.

1572
01:50:06.145 --> 01:50:09.983
He won't back any increase in pensions.
He won't even talk about it.

1573
01:50:10.116 --> 01:50:13.485
And there won't be any increase
in pensions. And do you know why?

1574
01:50:13.653 --> 01:50:15.511
Because they got a solid majority

1575
01:50:15.572 --> 01:50:17.739
of both Republicans and Democrats
who've agreed...

1576
01:50:17.907 --> 01:50:22.261
that if anything is said about pensions,
they'll actually reduce your pension!

1577
01:50:22.328 --> 01:50:25.108
Why? Because they know
that you personally

1578
01:50:25.206 --> 01:50:28.917
were more responsible than anybody
else for closing down the houses.

1579
01:50:29.085 --> 01:50:32.267
And could I do anything?
Would he listen to me? Ah!

1580
01:50:32.672 --> 01:50:35.090
All right, so you're an honest cop...

1581
01:50:35.258 --> 01:50:37.759
...and you've spent a lifetime
being an honest cop.

1582
01:50:37.927 --> 01:50:40.721
And you've got that,
and that's all you've got!

1583
01:50:40.888 --> 01:50:43.056
There's... no good saying I'm sorry.

1584
01:50:43.224 --> 01:50:46.351
I'm too angry and sick at
my stomach to be sorry.

1585
01:50:46.519 --> 01:50:50.856
<i>You're not even listening
to what I'm saying, and that's
the trouble with this whole family,</i>

1586
01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:55.857
<i>with you, with Daddy and Granny
and uncle Michael... everybody, but
nobody ever listens!</i>

1587
01:50:56.038 --> 01:50:58.358
<i>- Billie!
- They don't listen a minute
to anything...</i>

1588
01:50:58.579 --> 01:51:00.993
<i>- or to anybody else...
- Billie Sue! Billie Sue!</i>

1589
01:51:01.229 --> 01:51:04.035
Melville, I smell something burning.

1590
01:51:10.321 --> 01:51:13.135
We're on fire! Come over here.

1591
01:51:13.241 --> 01:51:16.159
Come on. This way.
Go down. Now, go!

1592
01:51:16.618 --> 01:51:17.827
Hurry up!

1593
01:51:18.735 --> 01:51:22.690
- Put it out!
- I don't know! Get something!

1594
01:51:22.815 --> 01:51:24.887
- The extinguishers.
- Get one!

1595
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:28.088
- What I do?
- Use it!

1596
01:51:28.256 --> 01:51:30.219
Not on me! On the fire!

1597
01:51:30.305 --> 01:51:31.341
It's too deep!

1598
01:51:31.509 --> 01:51:35.316
- This is a car, not a canoe!
- Come on! It's easy!

1599
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:38.542
If I don't get out of here...
Why? Why?

1600
01:51:42.060 --> 01:51:44.521
All right! All right! Here I come!

1601
01:51:48.526 --> 01:51:49.901
It's too deep!

1602
01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:52.501
It's too deep, you little rat fink!

1603
01:51:52.641 --> 01:51:54.893
Why didn't you tell me
it was too... What do I...

1604
01:51:55.073 --> 01:51:57.784
Don't stand there!
Get somebody! Don't st...

1605
01:51:57.952 --> 01:52:00.148
This is no place for a Convertible!!

1606
01:52:02.873 --> 01:52:04.374
I'll get you! I'll get you!

1607
01:52:12.482 --> 01:52:15.115
I'm bleeding, Emeline!
Look! I'm bleeding!

1608
01:52:15.208 --> 01:52:18.255
MY MAMA!! What did
they do to my Mama?!

1609
01:52:35.994 --> 01:52:37.056
Benjy!

1610
01:52:42.884 --> 01:52:44.571
<i>It is your father's fault.</i>

1611
01:52:44.696 --> 01:52:47.035
<i>- The whole thing is your father's fault.
- Oh, Mommy.</i>

1612
01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:49.072
<i>Everything is your father's fault.</i>

1613
01:52:49.361 --> 01:52:52.260
What's the matter, Chief?
Somethin' wrong?

1614
01:52:52.315 --> 01:52:55.161
<i>- You know as well as I do...
- Mommy, will you listen and stop yelling!</i>

1615
01:52:55.259 --> 01:52:57.049
<i>Stop it, Billie.</i>

1616
01:52:57.213 --> 01:52:58.804
<i>Billie, you're not listening.</i>

a fire in the basement,</i>

of the ventilator. Over.</i>

1628

<i>4-2-7-Echo to Central.
We can see the man Otto Meyer now.</i>

1629
01:53:59.639 --> 01:54:03.129
<i>He found a shallow spot in the creek
but that kid is throwing rocks at him.</i>

1630

<i>Over.</i>

1631
01:54:05.015 --> 01:54:09.915
<i>2-1-7-6-2-1-5-3. The man Pike
is down by the breakdown truck now.</i>

1632
01:54:10.056 --> 01:54:12.131
<i>Mrs. Marcus is still inside it.</i>

1633
01:54:12.307 --> 01:54:14.817
<i>She's crying, but she just
hit him again. Over.</i>

<i>3-8-9-Daisy to Central. There's
something wrong in that plane.</i>

Over.</i>

<i>has stopped outside the Avis
rent-a-car agency in Canyon City.</i>

1649
01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:47.948
<i>3-8-9-Daisy to Central.
The plane's still in the air,</i>

and caused a four-car-smash-up. Over.</i>

again. Over.</i>

1660
01:58:59.935 --> 01:59:04.895
<i>4-2-7-Echo to Central. The man Meyer
is still sitting on a rock in the
middle of the creek.</i>

1661
01:59:05.287 --> 01:59:09.312
<i>He's shouting at the kid, but the kid's
been gone for 20 minutes. Over.</i>

moving in the basement again.</i>

<i>They must be trying
something else. Over.</i>

1664
02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:28.253
Now stop it. Stop it, Monica!

1665
02:03:28.753 --> 02:03:31.503
It's only a couple of pieces
of small dynamite.

1666
02:03:31.911 --> 02:03:34.214
An- an- and they're 70 feet away,
in the other room.

1667
02:03:34.578 --> 02:03:38.328
And this is a strong counter.
We can't possibly get hurt from there.

1668
02:03:56.875 --> 02:03:59.736
Please, Melville, go and stop it.
Stamp on it or something.

1669
02:03:59.812 --> 02:04:03.031
- You know I hate explosions.
- Look, it's perfectly all right.

1670
02:04:03.133 --> 02:04:06.830
All I wanna do is to blow a little
hole in the wall, and then we'll be
outta here!

1671
02:04:18.509 --> 02:04:20.253
Something's happened to the fuse.

1672
02:04:20.845 --> 02:04:23.089
- What could possibly...
- Hold it. Sh!

1673
02:04:23.472 --> 02:04:24.472
Listen.

1674
02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:27.701
The fuse has gone out.
I can't hear it anymore.

1675
02:04:29.103 --> 02:04:32.814
- Stay down. Don't get up!
- I just wanna take a look. Okay?

1676
02:04:37.062 --> 02:04:39.369
Huh! Oh, now I see.

1677
02:04:40.739 --> 02:04:42.578
It's the fire extinguisher stuff.

1678
02:04:43.007 --> 02:04:45.815
The fire extinguisher stuff got
all over the fuse and put it out.

1679
02:04:45.893 --> 02:04:48.176
Melville, don't you go in there!
You'll be killed!

1680
02:04:48.278 --> 02:04:51.624
- You'll be blown to bits!
- Monica, for Heaven's sake!

1681
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:54.452
I just wanna go in there
to take a look!

1682
02:04:56.969 --> 02:05:00.133
Why do you always imagine
I can't do things for myself?

1683
02:05:00.301 --> 02:05:02.468
Don't you think I got
any sense at all?!

1684
02:05:03.533 --> 02:05:05.829
Why can't you have
a little confidence in me?

1685
02:05:44.091 --> 02:05:46.872
- Listen...
- I'll never be bad again!
- Whoever told you you could fly?

1686
02:05:46.966 --> 02:05:49.079
What do ya want from me?
How long I been flyin'?

1687
02:05:49.172 --> 02:05:51.463
- Keep it going!
- Can't you talk to that radio?

1688
02:05:51.557 --> 02:05:54.463
Hello! Hello, anybody on the ground?
On the ground, anybody!

1689
02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:56.348
We're up here, can you hear us?

1690
02:06:08.393 --> 02:06:10.662
- Stand back!
- Everybody, stand back!

1691
02:06:10.829 --> 02:06:13.558
Stand back, folks! Folks, stand back!

1692
02:06:20.693 --> 02:06:23.130
This is Rancho Conejo Tower.
Do you hear me?

1693
02:06:23.357 --> 02:06:26.238
- This is Rancho Conejo Tower, do you hear me?
<i>- We don't know who they are.</i>

1694
02:06:26.262 --> 02:06:29.061
<i>Aircraft calling Rancho Conejo Tower.</i>

1695
02:06:29.139 --> 02:06:32.141
<i>- This is Rancho Conejo Tower...</i>
- Hey, Benjy, I got 'em, I got'em!

1696
02:06:32.219 --> 02:06:34.885
I got 'em! Hello, down there on the ground!

1697
02:06:34.987 --> 02:06:37.317
This is us, up here in the air,
and we're in trouble!

1698
02:06:37.442 --> 02:06:40.441
We're in an awful jam!
Listen... Hello?

1699
02:06:41.043 --> 02:06:42.459
Oh, Benjy, I think I lost 'em!

1700
02:06:42.957 --> 02:06:45.150
<i>Wait a minute. You're not
using the set the right way.</i>

1701

<i>You press your switch in to transmit.

1702
02:06:49.076 --> 02:06:51.898
<i>Can you understand me?
This is Rancho Conejo Tower.</i>

1703
02:06:52.318 --> 02:06:56.429
<i>- Where are you and who are you? Over.</i>
- I know how to work it now, Benjy-boy!

1704
02:06:56.508 --> 02:06:59.203
I know how to work it. Watch it!
Hello! Hello, down on the ground,

1705
02:06:59.273 --> 02:07:02.637
this is us up in the air, and, listen--
we're in this fella's plane, see?

1706
02:07:02.723 --> 02:07:05.061
And he... he knocked himself out,

1707
02:07:05.147 --> 02:07:08.424
because he drank a whole case of bourbon,
and he fell down and he hit his head!

1708
02:07:08.554 --> 02:07:10.415
And... what do we do?!
You know...

1709
02:07:10.626 --> 02:07:12.724
The switch, let go of the switch!

1710
02:07:13.175 --> 02:07:15.607
<i>If you can, give us your position.</i>

1711
02:07:15.755 --> 02:07:17.729
<i>Who's flying the plane? Over.</i>

1712
02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:20.556
What do you mean,
"Who's flying the plane?!"

1713
02:07:21.216 --> 02:07:23.492
Nobody's flying the plane!

1714
02:07:23.709 --> 02:07:26.102
<i>Can't you understand?
We're in real trouble.</i>

1715
02:07:26.164 --> 02:07:28.235
There it is! Let me.

1716
02:07:28.895 --> 02:07:30.719
Rancho Conejo Tower. Listen.

1717
02:07:30.812 --> 02:07:33.819
We've got you spotted, we can see you.
Now you've got to hold that course.

1718
02:07:33.916 --> 02:07:36.924
You think you can hold that plane
on course long enough for us
to get something organized?

1719
02:07:36.948 --> 02:07:38.087
Rancho Conejo, over.

1720
02:07:38.348 --> 02:07:40.583
<i>No, listen, I keep telling you:
We can't do anything.</i>

1721
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:42.510
<i>You gotta get somebody
else to do something!</i>

1722
02:07:42.681 --> 02:07:44.211
<i>Can we parachute?!</i>

1723
02:07:45.959 --> 02:07:48.273
Sir? Tower here. Emergency.
We have contacted...

1724
02:07:48.359 --> 02:07:51.194
Tell him it's a full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down. Tell 'em!

1725
02:07:51.389 --> 02:07:53.639
Full emergency. We'll try
and talk 'em down. Right, sir.

1726
02:07:53.807 --> 02:07:56.428
It's a Twin Beech. There was
one here, I saw it this morning.

1727
02:07:56.522 --> 02:07:59.345
Who's got a Twin Beech?
It's that colonel, Col. Wilberforce.

1728
02:07:59.424 --> 02:08:02.364
He was over at maintenance. If he's still
over there, get him over here and hurry!

1729
02:08:02.691 --> 02:08:05.513
Rancho Canajo Tower. Now listen.
Don't talk, just listen.

1730
02:08:05.818 --> 02:08:08.320
We're getting things under control,
so you can take it easy.

1731
02:08:08.488 --> 02:08:10.161
We know what kind of a plane
you're in, we can see you,

1732
02:08:10.185 --> 02:08:12.745
and we're making all the necessary
preparations to talk you down.

1733
02:08:12.826 --> 02:08:14.180
Rancho Conejo. Over.

1734
02:08:14.286 --> 02:08:17.585
<i>Up here to Rancho Conejo tower. Listen,
we can't land this thing, understand!</i>

1735
02:08:17.664 --> 02:08:19.790
<i>We're in real trouble. Over!</i>

1736
02:08:19.958 --> 02:08:23.335
Listen, you will be perfectly all right
as long as you follow instructions.

1737
02:08:23.503 --> 02:08:26.839
One thing: is important that he man at
the controls is also the man on the radio.

1738
02:08:28.133 --> 02:08:32.033
- Here. - Hey, get outta here.
- Put 'em on. - No. I don't want to!

1739
02:08:32.158 --> 02:08:35.347
Put 'em on! He said the fella that was
flying should be talking on this thing.

1740
02:08:35.515 --> 02:08:38.931
What am I supposed to do, everything?
You want me to fly, idiot, you want me
to work the radio?

1741
02:08:38.955 --> 02:08:41.165
What are you gonna...?
What are you, the hostess?

1742
02:08:41.896 --> 02:08:44.858
He's gotta take charge of this situation!
What's the matter with him, anyway?

1743
02:08:44.882 --> 02:08:46.861
He's just sitting there, rigid-like.

1744
02:08:46.962 --> 02:08:50.279
If he catches you at that keyhole,
you'll be rigid-like.

1745
02:08:50.447 --> 02:08:53.793
- He said he didn't want to be disturbed.
- All he does is keep looking at the wall.

1746
02:08:53.887 --> 02:08:56.512
Well, he'll have to be disturbed
if any of this things develops further.

1747
02:08:56.536 --> 02:09:00.515
I bet you any amount of money that we
could get on the ball and get what he...

1748
02:09:03.225 --> 02:09:05.290
- Everything's under control, Chief.
- Hm.

1749
02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:07.547
- Hey, you okay, Chief?
- Hm.

1750
02:09:08.195 --> 02:09:10.717
Yes, why? How's it been going?

1751
02:09:10.741 --> 02:09:13.621
Ah, something's about to happen
sooner or later. Oh, take a look at this.

1752
02:09:13.678 --> 02:09:16.164
Those two in the basement
first of all started a fire,

1753
02:09:16.222 --> 02:09:18.672
then set off a lot of fireworks.
They still didn't get out.

1754
02:09:19.059 --> 02:09:23.228
Those two characters in the airplane
had a little accident, knocked the pilot
unconscious.

1755
02:09:23.396 --> 02:09:26.015
The control tower at the airport
is trying to talk them down.

1756
02:09:28.068 --> 02:09:29.401
<i>The others...</i>

1757
02:09:29.569 --> 02:09:32.423
<i>Aerial report, the man Otto Meyer,
well, he had a little accident.</i>

1758
02:09:32.454 --> 02:09:35.110
<i>You see, he was trying to-- trying to
cross the river and he lost his car.</i>

1759
02:09:35.134 --> 02:09:37.743
<i>Now he's on foot, walking
back to the main road.</i>

1760
02:09:39.070 --> 02:09:41.477
<i>This fella Pike... he's about here,</i>

1761
02:09:41.555 --> 02:09:44.962
<i>coming in on 94 with Mrs. Marcus
and her daughter, Mrs. Finch.</i>

1762
02:09:46.670 --> 02:09:50.334
<i>Mr. Finch and this Algernon,
whatever his name is, the Limey...</i>

1763
02:09:50.757 --> 02:09:52.597
<i>they're about five or
six miles behind, in a...</i>

1764
02:09:52.964 --> 02:09:55.253
<i>Avis Chevrolet they rented
in Canyon City.</i>

1765
02:09:55.878 --> 02:09:58.605
<i>And this Sylvester Marcus, he's
the one the old lady called,</i>

1766
02:09:58.675 --> 02:10:00.620
<i>he's about here, going
in the other direction.</i>

1767
02:10:03.107 --> 02:10:05.948
They all ought to be meeting up
in about five or ten minutes.

1768
02:10:20.787 --> 02:10:24.000
You know what I believe, um...
I'd like?

1769
02:10:25.917 --> 02:10:30.954
A Chocolate Fudge Sundae, with
whipped cream and a cherry on top.

1770
02:10:34.328 --> 02:10:36.477
Nothing will happen here
for five minutes.

1771
02:10:36.547 --> 02:10:38.290
Mrs. Culpepper's on the phone.

1772
02:10:40.061 --> 02:10:42.273
No calls. No more calls.

1773
02:10:44.702 --> 02:10:46.992
No. More. Calls.

1774
02:10:49.653 --> 02:10:51.968
Wow! What's with him?

1775
02:10:52.734 --> 02:10:56.494
- Something's wrong.
- Oh, why? Something's gotta be wrong?

1776
02:10:56.785 --> 02:10:59.886
He feels like, uh...
a Chocolate Fudge Sundae.

1777
02:11:00.636 --> 02:11:03.056
So, what? He has a <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>Chocolate Fudge Sundae.</u></font>

1778
02:11:14.928 --> 02:11:19.085
- Hey, Benjy! Benjy! Don't hit those trees!
- That part is a saw-up. - Pull up!

1779
02:11:22.602 --> 02:11:26.588
Dingy, don't let this worry you:
We're gonna get killed...

1780
02:11:27.196 --> 02:11:29.499
<i>Men, this is Col. Wilberforce speaking.</i>

1781
02:11:29.577 --> 02:11:33.477
<i>These gentlemen here have asked me
to, um... take charge of this situation,</i>

1782
02:11:33.524 --> 02:11:37.597
<i>so, I immediately said that I'd
be glad to, um... take charge of it.</i>

1783
02:11:37.727 --> 02:11:39.603
<i>Now, before I say anything else...</i>

1784
02:11:39.947 --> 02:11:44.254
- I don't think he's gonna help us, Dingy.
- Yes, he is, Benjy. He'll help us.

1785
02:11:44.347 --> 02:11:47.444
Now, just have confidence in him.
He's a Colonel, listen to him!

1786
02:11:47.820 --> 02:11:49.321
Steady, men.

1787
02:11:49.489 --> 02:11:52.658
Well now, I'm told that neither of you
has had any flying experience.

1788
02:11:52.826 --> 02:11:54.706
And before I say anything else,

1789
02:11:54.786 --> 02:11:58.158
I want to congratulate you
on having done so well...

1790
02:11:58.351 --> 02:12:00.124
...uh... so far.

1791
02:12:00.537 --> 02:12:04.069
Now! First of all, men, I'll explain
what we intend to do.

1792
02:12:04.504 --> 02:12:08.132
You can't land the airplane
until you've made your approach.

1793
02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:13.330
And you can't make your approach, until
you've made a long slow turnaround...

1794
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:14.908
down to the south.

1795
02:12:15.223 --> 02:12:20.632
And we've got to be clear on a few things
before you can start that long slow turn.

1796
02:12:20.979 --> 02:12:25.691
Now, the stick that you're holding there...
that is... I assume, that...

1797
02:12:25.859 --> 02:12:29.737
Now men, are you holding that stick?
Is somebody holding that stick?! Over!

1798
02:12:29.905 --> 02:12:33.282
<i>What stick? Oh, the wheel!
I'm holding it.</i>

1799
02:12:33.450 --> 02:12:35.534
<i>- We're both holding it.</i>
- Oh, good.

1800
02:12:35.702 --> 02:12:38.996
Just for a second there, I was afraid...
Well, never mind that.

1801
02:12:39.164 --> 02:12:42.754
Now I'll explain the controls.
It's very important that you
understand the controls!

1802
02:12:42.847 --> 02:12:46.002
Because if you don't,
I'm afraid what might hap...

1803
02:12:56.815 --> 02:13:00.003
- Hello?
- I was afraid you weren't
gonna be at home, Jimmy.

1804
02:13:00.604 --> 02:13:05.304
Hey, is this who I think it is?
Is this Capt. Culpepper?

1805
02:13:05.535 --> 02:13:07.105
<i>What are you calling me for?</i>

1806
02:13:07.446 --> 02:13:11.392
Why, I was wondering, um...
how that 'Natalie Anders' is these days.

1807
02:13:13.265 --> 02:13:15.666
Well, she's fine. But why?

1808
02:13:15.708 --> 02:13:18.808
<i>Well, I was thinking about
a little trip, Jimmy.</i>

1809
02:13:19.379 --> 02:13:20.379
You?

1810
02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:22.405
You mean, with me?

1811
02:13:22.702 --> 02:13:28.211
I thought we could just slip quietly out
on a sort of cruise to the south.

1812
02:13:28.594 --> 02:13:29.612
You know, Jimmy?

1813
02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:34.613
You mean a round trip or,
um... just one-way?

1814
02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:38.214
Just one-way, Jimmy.

1815
02:13:38.755 --> 02:13:42.655
<i>- Could we go right away?</i>
- Oh, sure, um... Oh, but wait.

1816
02:13:43.690 --> 02:13:46.153
Is there, um... something in it for me?

1817
02:13:47.888 --> 02:13:50.038
There's something in it
for everybody, Jimmy.

1818
02:13:50.418 --> 02:13:53.082
Listen, if you are throwing me a curve...

1819
02:13:53.152 --> 02:13:55.129
<i>You know, I wouldn't do a thing like that.</i>

1820
02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:58.520
I won't be long. Thanks a lot, Jimmy.

1821
02:14:24.809 --> 02:14:27.545
- You want a lift?
- Yes, thank you very much.

1822
02:14:27.616 --> 02:14:29.479
I say, it's awful nice of you to stop.

1823
02:14:29.891 --> 02:14:32.793
- You see, I'm just going as far
as Santa Rosita Park.
- Oh, that's out of my way.

1824
02:14:32.817 --> 02:14:34.319
- We're blocking traffic.
- We are?

1825
02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:36.000
Let's move it.
Will you-- will you move it?

1826
02:14:50.501 --> 02:14:52.085
Here we go. All right.

1827
02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:55.688
Move just over, hide behind the counter,
and I'll light up a fuse.

1828
02:14:55.781 --> 02:14:59.717
Melville, will you just do one thing
for me before you use the dynamite?

1829
02:14:59.885 --> 02:15:02.050
Try hitting the door just once more...

1830
02:15:02.763 --> 02:15:06.850
Oh, honey, I broke my back on that
door. That's a hard door. I mean...

1831
02:15:10.354 --> 02:15:11.354
Okay.

1832
02:15:12.129 --> 02:15:13.919
Where's the sledgehammer?

1833
02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:25.743
Hey, this staircase isn't safe. I mean,
the-- the fire burned it all out.

1834
02:15:25.911 --> 02:15:27.120
Pleease?

1835
02:15:29.498 --> 02:15:30.648
All right.

1836
02:15:41.927 --> 02:15:43.803
Ohh, you're gonna...

1837
02:15:53.397 --> 02:15:54.981
Melville, for God...

1838
02:15:55.149 --> 02:15:56.399
Melville!

1839
02:15:59.445 --> 02:16:00.820
Monica...

1840
02:16:00.988 --> 02:16:03.531
...now let's forget
about the door, huh?

1841
02:16:08.162 --> 02:16:09.162
Look out!

1842
02:16:09.288 --> 02:16:11.289
- What? What, what?
- They've spotted us.

1843
02:16:11.457 --> 02:16:13.740
- Who, who have?
- Don't stop driving, man. Keep going.

1844
02:16:13.865 --> 02:16:16.037
- What, what is this?
- That helicopter. They've seen us.

1845
02:16:16.061 --> 02:16:17.253
What helicopter?

1846
02:16:19.507 --> 02:16:20.922
That's a police helicopter.

1847
02:16:21.008 --> 02:16:23.073
Yeah, that's what it looks like.
They always use 'em.

1848
02:16:23.104 --> 02:16:25.633
- Who, who always uses...?
- Who do you think? Look...

1849
02:16:26.013 --> 02:16:28.813
I don't want to talk about this, but
they got me, the got me hemmed in!

1850
02:16:28.933 --> 02:16:30.773
- Who, who have?
- Will you shut up and listen?

1851
02:16:31.021 --> 02:16:35.203
Alright. I'm gonna break a rule.
A rule that says we must never
reveal our true identity.

1852
02:16:35.282 --> 02:16:37.969
But this is a matter of life or death,
this is a desperate situation.

1853
02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:40.360
- Wha-- what is?
- Will you shut up and listen?!

1854
02:16:40.528 --> 02:16:43.403
Now look, I haven't got much time,
so if you love your country,

1855
02:16:43.531 --> 02:16:46.265
if you're a patriot, you'll listen
and you'll listen hard.

1856
02:16:46.406 --> 02:16:48.261
You gotta get to a phone,
and you gotta make a call.

1857
02:16:48.285 --> 02:16:50.388
- I gotta get to a phone and...
- Yes, you got to call Intelligence.

1858
02:16:50.412 --> 02:16:52.506
Central Intelligence Agency
in Washington, D.C.

1859
02:16:52.581 --> 02:16:54.374
- What on Earth I...
- Now, LISTEN!!

1860
02:16:54.686 --> 02:16:58.044
You tell 'em you heard from X-27.
You got it? X-27.

1861
02:16:58.212 --> 02:17:01.673
X-27 told you to tell them they've made
three attempts on my life today already,

1862
02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:03.652
I've been down the silver mine,
they tried to drown me.

1863
02:17:03.676 --> 02:17:06.131
Can you handle a gun? Now, look... Oh!

1864
02:17:06.381 --> 02:17:08.823
Good, there's a cafe. Pull right in
there. You'll use that phone.

1865
02:17:08.847 --> 02:17:10.429
- Look, I don't think I wanna
get to a phone...
- You shut up!

1866
02:17:10.453 --> 02:17:13.166
You're in no danger, they've
never seen ya. Now, pull in.

1867
02:17:20.317 --> 02:17:21.538
All right, good. Now look:

1868
02:17:21.655 --> 02:17:24.433
get to a phone, tell the operator
"emergency priority",

1869
02:17:24.457 --> 02:17:25.799
and then ask for the CIA, alright?

1870
02:17:25.823 --> 02:17:27.824
Jump out. Jump. Come on, come on!

1871
02:17:27.911 --> 02:17:30.135
You're in no danger.
They don't know you!

1872
02:17:30.174 --> 02:17:32.965
You're all right. Now look, I'll duck
the car and I'll come back for you.

1873
02:17:32.989 --> 02:17:36.935
For God's sakes, man, don't stand in the
street. They'll see you. They'll spot you!

1874
02:17:37.052 --> 02:17:39.168
Move it! Go! Heya, yahaa! Go!

1875
02:17:44.439 --> 02:17:47.863
But I still say: when we get to
Santa Rosita, we oughtta go
straight to the police.

1876
02:17:47.941 --> 02:17:49.722
No. First we go out to that park,

1877
02:17:49.822 --> 02:17:52.701
and if we find that the others
have already been there and gone,

1878
02:17:52.743 --> 02:17:54.698
then we go straight to the police,

1879
02:17:54.753 --> 02:17:57.452
because for all we know,
there may be a reward.

1880
02:18:06.802 --> 02:18:10.234
And... Sylvester! It's Sylvester!
<i>Turn around, you idiot!</i>

1881
02:18:10.429 --> 02:18:13.212
What do you want to stop him for?
He's going the wrong way.

1882
02:18:13.290 --> 02:18:15.736
It's my son! Do as you're told, stupid.

1883
02:18:32.418 --> 02:18:33.418
They're nuts!

1884
02:18:33.553 --> 02:18:36.664
Call in and tell them the tow truck
turned around and is following the Dodge!

1885
02:18:37.290 --> 02:18:39.500
<i>2-1-7-1-2-1-5-9.</i>

1886
02:18:41.230 --> 02:18:42.503
This is stupid.

1887
02:18:42.884 --> 02:18:44.571
You call me a stupid idiot?

1888
02:18:44.782 --> 02:18:47.042
Let me tell you something:
you're a stupid idiot.

1889
02:18:47.112 --> 02:18:51.044
- But he'll go all the way to Plaster City!
- So he goes all the way to Plaster City.

1890
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:53.969
I don't know about you, but
I'm turning this thing around.

1891
02:18:54.124 --> 02:18:56.892
Now, you want to catch 'im,
you get out and run!

1892
02:19:17.164 --> 02:19:18.916
Let's stop arguing, please.

1893
02:19:19.010 --> 02:19:21.533
The only reason we're together
is because they only had one car.

1894
02:19:21.877 --> 02:19:24.212
So let's get there, even if we are last.

1895
02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:29.226
Whatever the outcome of the day,
I shall never forget that you hit me...

1896
02:19:29.288 --> 02:19:30.996
when I wasn't even looking!

1897
02:19:31.636 --> 02:19:32.642
Yeah.

1898
02:19:41.313 --> 02:19:43.081
Hey, Russell! RUSSELL!!

1899
02:19:56.418 --> 02:20:00.206
- How can you possibly be so slow?!
- I've had just about enough out of you.

1900
02:20:00.373 --> 02:20:02.468
If you've been quicker turning around
we could've caught him!

1901
02:20:02.492 --> 02:20:05.442
- Now, why don't you shut up?
- Russell! There!

1902
02:20:05.504 --> 02:20:08.842
- It's Russell and Mr. Hawthorne!
- Wel, stop him, catch him!

1903
02:20:08.912 --> 02:20:10.359
We gonna start that again?

1904
02:20:10.425 --> 02:20:12.763
Faster! Step on it!
Blow the horn, you big dope!

1905
02:20:12.982 --> 02:20:14.898
Look, what do you want
these guys for, anyway?

1906
02:20:14.971 --> 02:20:17.116
You gotta keep up with them!
You're falling behind, you...

1907
02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:19.900
Sylvester! Mother! Sylvesteeer!

1908
02:20:20.009 --> 02:20:22.613
Well, stop him! Don't let him get away,
don't let him get away!

1909
02:20:27.526 --> 02:20:30.402
I say, what's that chap
honking his hooter for?

1910
02:20:30.570 --> 02:20:33.270
I don't know, it's probably some
road hog who thinks he owns...

1911
02:20:33.573 --> 02:20:35.012
- What?
- What? What?

1912
02:20:35.184 --> 02:20:38.100
I got to ask you something about Mama!
Russell, wait a minute!

1913
02:20:38.194 --> 02:20:40.467
It's my brother-in-law!
What's he doing?

1914
02:20:41.122 --> 02:20:43.927
Be careful, be careful of him.
He's not normal.

1915
02:20:44.751 --> 02:20:47.439
You're getting me...
Boy, are you bugging me, man!

1916
02:20:47.504 --> 02:20:52.795
I'm gonna... when I get... I'm gonna
nail... U-hu-hu, God, I'm getting
bugged now! Whoa, man.

1917
02:20:53.969 --> 02:20:56.377
Russell, will you pull... if you
don't pull over, I'll kill you!

1918
02:20:56.401 --> 02:20:58.534
Russell, I'm warning you,
pull over and stop!

1919
02:20:58.640 --> 02:21:01.809
I said stop! Well, you asked for it!

1920
02:21:09.651 --> 02:21:11.598
Russell, when I get my hands on you...

1921
02:21:12.723 --> 02:21:13.723
What are you doing?!

1922
02:21:14.322 --> 02:21:15.823
- I said stop!
- Are you crazy?

1923
02:21:15.991 --> 02:21:18.158
<i>- We'll get killed!
- Pull over!</i>

1924
02:21:28.545 --> 02:21:33.024
Don't you know what I mean?
I-SAID-STOP-THAT-CAAAR!!

1925
02:21:34.988 --> 02:21:35.988
<i>Look out!</i>

1926
02:21:36.896 --> 02:21:40.295
You know, when I get my hands
on you, Russell, I will kill you!

1927
02:21:58.945 --> 02:22:00.914
You crazy?! Are you crazy?!

1928
02:22:10.002 --> 02:22:12.268
I've never seen anything
like this bunch.

1929
02:22:12.881 --> 02:22:15.682
He ran right into 'em, he
ran them right off the road!

1930
02:22:16.718 --> 02:22:20.387
- Guys, you guys, come on outta there!
- Fellow's absolutely beside himself.

1931
02:22:20.555 --> 02:22:23.084
- Sylvester, what are you trying to do?
- Come on, let's go!

1932
02:22:23.141 --> 02:22:26.541
- What did you do to my mother?!
- We wouldn't do any to your
sweet little mother...

1933
02:22:26.645 --> 02:22:27.728
Come on, move! Move!

1934
02:22:27.819 --> 02:22:30.749
- What did you do to my mother?
- I didn't do anything! Let me explain.

1935
02:22:31.153 --> 02:22:32.176
Now, look!

1936
02:22:33.735 --> 02:22:35.235
She called me. She phoned me.

1937
02:22:35.403 --> 02:22:38.100
What she told me was so horrible,
I thought she'd gone nuts or something!

1938
02:22:38.124 --> 02:22:39.879
- It was true, wasn't it?
- It isn't true.

1939
02:22:39.921 --> 02:22:42.462
Whoever told you that, she was
a liar. It's not true!

1940
02:22:42.665 --> 02:22:45.025
- It is true!
- Now, look here!

1941
02:22:47.165 --> 02:22:49.409
Are you English?! Just answer me,
are you English?!

1942
02:22:49.459 --> 02:22:53.198
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.
Why, don't you like the English?

1943
02:22:56.216 --> 02:22:57.576
She said, there was an Englishman.

1944
02:22:57.609 --> 02:23:00.619
She said that you and this Englishman...
I'll kill you! I'm killing you!

1945
02:23:00.658 --> 02:23:02.002
Sebastian! Don't [...]

1946
02:23:02.097 --> 02:23:04.060
Tell me, what did you do to my Mama?
What did you do to my Mama?

1947
02:23:04.130 --> 02:23:06.951
- Emeline! Emeline!
- Sylvester!
- Mama!

1948
02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:09.853
Why couldn't you listen?!
Why couldn't you shut up,

1949
02:23:10.021 --> 02:23:11.621
when I was trying
to tell you to listen?!

1950
02:23:11.773 --> 02:23:14.707
Have a care! That chap's run
absolutely amok!

1951
02:23:14.749 --> 02:23:16.378
<i>But how come you...
I thought that...</i>

1952
02:23:16.420 --> 02:23:19.460
Mama, you told me, when you called me
on the telephone, you told me that he...

1953
02:23:19.502 --> 02:23:22.050
Why do I wanna say a thing
like that? Say, what is this?

1954
02:23:22.092 --> 02:23:24.361
What's going on here?
Will somebody please tell me?

1955
02:23:24.403 --> 02:23:27.212
Oh, shut up, will you?! You should've
had sense enough to listen!

1956
02:23:27.254 --> 02:23:29.459
Sweety, I couldn't help it.
You know that, honeybunch.

1957
02:23:29.623 --> 02:23:31.568
Oh, Russell, you shouldn't have
done what you did!

1958
02:23:31.592 --> 02:23:34.410
What? What did he do? Tell me what
he did, I'll rip his ugly head off!

1959
02:23:34.481 --> 02:23:37.772
No, no, please. Let's stop it.
We're wasting too much time.
We're wasting too much time!

1960
02:23:37.796 --> 02:23:38.796
- Hear, hear!
- Yeah.

1961
02:23:38.833 --> 02:23:42.048
Okay, okay, I've had enough.
I'll see you around, okay?

1962
02:23:42.109 --> 02:23:44.774
Now you stay right where you are!
You admitted that you stole that truck,

1963
02:23:44.798 --> 02:23:46.629
We can have you
picked up in 2 minutes!

1964
02:23:46.730 --> 02:23:50.153
Listen, will somebody tell me what's
going ooon here?! Will somebody give me
one word of information?!

1965
02:23:50.177 --> 02:23:53.257
I TOLD YOU ONCE!!
There was an accident this morning!

1966
02:23:54.162 --> 02:23:57.402
- You-you mean, it's true! About
the money being buried?
- That's true. It's true!

1967
02:23:57.455 --> 02:23:59.972
And while the others are there already,
we're standing here arguing!

1968
02:23:59.996 --> 02:24:02.431
Well, let's get moving, before
the others... Others, what others?
Who- who are the others?

1969
02:24:02.455 --> 02:24:04.887
Nobody! But that we will
explain it all on the way!

1970
02:24:04.941 --> 02:24:07.263
I say, we don't appear
to have a motorcar.

1971
02:24:07.326 --> 02:24:09.086
Yeah, I won't be able
to get mine out either!

1972
02:24:13.351 --> 02:24:16.551
Wait a minute, wait a minute, now wait...
like... Just let me tell you something.

1973
02:24:16.598 --> 02:24:18.938
You go your way and I'll go my way.

1974
02:24:19.089 --> 02:24:20.998
Okay? I'll see you around.

1975
02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:23.778
Hold it, buster. Looks like we're all
gonna use this truck. You know this
neighborhood?

1976
02:24:23.802 --> 02:24:25.132
- No.
- But I do. So, I'll drive.

1977
02:24:25.202 --> 02:24:27.351
Mama, make up your mind! What you
wanna do? You wanna take them
with us or not?

1978
02:24:27.375 --> 02:24:29.754
We'll have to take them with us!
Otherwise they're gonna call the police!

1979
02:24:29.778 --> 02:24:30.863
All right! You two guys jump
in the back of the truck!

1980
02:24:30.887 --> 02:24:32.602
You too! Sis and Mom
are right up front with me!

1981
02:24:32.626 --> 02:24:35.897
Come on, Mama, just let's go!
Everybody in the truck! Everybody in...

1982
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:38.911
Now, in a couple of minutes
we'll have them in position, Colonel.

1983
02:24:38.935 --> 02:24:41.375
In another couple of minutes, men,
we'll have you in position.

1984
02:24:41.921 --> 02:24:44.041
- You're doing a great job, Colonel.
- Thank you.

1985
02:24:44.127 --> 02:24:46.820
Why don't we just shoot 'em down
and be through with it?

1986
02:24:47.688 --> 02:24:49.488
<i>- Oh oh.
- Oh oh, man!</i>

1987
02:24:52.090 --> 02:24:56.201
<i>- He's gonna pull up, isn't he?
- Why don't you pull up? Aren't you, man?</i>

1988
02:25:02.139 --> 02:25:04.305
None of these people must suspect...

1989
02:25:05.225 --> 02:25:07.438
...that they have ever
been under observation.

1990
02:25:09.146 --> 02:25:11.230
Now, none of them have ever seen me.

1991
02:25:11.398 --> 02:25:12.940
None of them know me,

1992
02:25:13.108 --> 02:25:15.818
so I'll be moving in... alone.

1993
02:25:17.071 --> 02:25:20.101
The minute I move in,
I'll give you the word.

1994
02:25:20.157 --> 02:25:22.158
And when you pass the word...

1995
02:25:23.675 --> 02:25:27.107
I don't want to have another
policeman within miles of me.

1996
02:25:27.232 --> 02:25:28.414
- Right?
- Right.

1997
02:25:30.461 --> 02:25:31.991
I, uh...

1998
02:25:32.992 --> 02:25:36.422
...I won't like it if I see
another policeman.

1999
02:25:38.257 --> 02:25:40.621
And I give you my word,
I- I wanted to stop for you.

2000
02:25:40.645 --> 02:25:42.906
My wife wanted to stop for
you. He wanted to stop for you.

2001
02:25:42.930 --> 02:25:45.367
But tell him, tell him how my
mother-in-law made us drive by him.

2002
02:25:45.391 --> 02:25:47.784
Listen, anything you have to say
about your mother-in-law,

2003
02:25:47.851 --> 02:25:49.268
you don't have to explain to me.

2004
02:25:49.436 --> 02:25:50.520
You know what I mean?

2005
02:25:50.688 --> 02:25:54.956
It's like if she were a star of a real
crummy horror movie, I'd believe it!

2006
02:25:57.410 --> 02:25:59.433
- Yeah!
- That's him, that's him!

2007
02:25:59.582 --> 02:26:02.811
[...] if I catch you, I'll kill you!
I tell you, I'll kill you!

2008
02:26:02.881 --> 02:26:06.578
- You dirty robber!
- Someone you know?

2009
02:26:22.546 --> 02:26:25.351
- I'll drive. All set?
- All set, Chief.

2010
02:26:26.181 --> 02:26:27.849
Culpepper, all set?

2011
02:26:28.016 --> 02:26:31.628
Yes, Sir, all set. Airport just
reported that they're starting
a landing approach now.

2012
02:26:31.979 --> 02:26:32.979
Right.

2013
02:26:40.988 --> 02:26:43.219
What's the matter, Chief?
You forgotten somethin'?

2014
02:26:45.993 --> 02:26:48.578
No. I don't think
I've forgotten a thing.

2015
02:27:00.370 --> 02:27:02.737
Now-- now, men, about the brakes.

2016
02:27:02.784 --> 02:27:04.724
You have to-- you have to know
about the brakes.

2017
02:27:04.833 --> 02:27:07.456
I- I- I wanna tell you about the brakes
in just a minute, just hold it a minute.

2018
02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:09.087
Just be-- just-- patient...

2019
02:27:09.129 --> 02:27:11.380
What the hell is with this wire here?!

2020
02:27:11.667 --> 02:27:13.183
Just hold it a second, will ya?

2021
02:27:13.759 --> 02:27:14.759
What was that?!

2022
02:27:15.302 --> 02:27:16.952
Now men, now look.
No- no- now...

2023
02:27:16.984 --> 02:27:19.411
Just hold it a minute, just be patient
for just one little minute, eh?

2024
02:27:19.435 --> 02:27:21.171
- Hold it, hold it!
- Yes, sir, yes.

2025
02:27:24.879 --> 02:27:26.575
No, that's not it.

2026
02:27:27.441 --> 02:27:30.816
Left... nnoo! That's not it.

2027
02:27:31.857 --> 02:27:34.677
- On- on second thought, men,
you won't need the brakes.
- Sir... Sir.

2028
02:27:35.448 --> 02:27:38.962
O- on second thought, men,
you won't need to use the brakes.

2029
02:27:39.032 --> 02:27:41.821
Ah.. the runway is so long here,
that when you throttle back,

2030
02:27:41.907 --> 02:27:44.706
the plane will just come
to a full stop naturally.

2031
02:27:44.784 --> 02:27:47.034
Yes. So, forget about the brakes, men!

2032
02:27:47.112 --> 02:27:50.223
- I tell you, you won't need the brakes!
- But, Colonel...

2033
02:27:50.453 --> 02:27:52.983
All right now, men. All right now, men.
The chips are down!

2034
02:27:53.789 --> 02:27:57.898
<i>Be calm. This is it. Just one minute
more, men, and it'll be all over.</i>

2035
02:27:57.979 --> 02:28:00.522
<i>I- I- I mean, it'll all be over.
I mean, courage, men.</i>

2036
02:28:00.690 --> 02:28:03.733
<i>Because we're all with you down here
every second on the way, men.</i>

2037
02:28:03.901 --> 02:28:06.770
<i>We're all pulling for you
just as hard as we can.</i>

2038
02:28:06.848 --> 02:28:09.108
<i>So, now it's just hold onto
your nerves, men,</i>

2039
02:28:09.397 --> 02:28:11.660
<i>and not get excited nor do
anything foolish.</i>

2040
02:28:11.739 --> 02:28:14.167
<i>But just keep calm.
That's all we gotta do, men.</i>

2041
02:28:14.214 --> 02:28:16.329
<i>Keep calm. Calm, men!</i>

2042
02:28:20.209 --> 02:28:22.085
Not that calm, you idiot!

2043
02:28:26.632 --> 02:28:28.508
<i>Pull up!</i>

2044
02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:43.690
Now, don't worry. Just keep calm.

2045
02:28:44.849 --> 02:28:47.444
What's this? Wha- what- what's
this that is coming?

2046
02:28:47.523 --> 02:28:49.556
- That's good. That's cement.
- What? No-no-no...

2047
02:28:49.869 --> 02:28:52.073
Wait a minute! Wait! Hold it!
Wait a minute...

2048
02:28:52.241 --> 02:28:54.918
What are you doing, Benjy?
Wait! Wait!!

2049
02:29:00.291 --> 02:29:01.977
What, are you trying to scare me?

2050
02:29:02.001 --> 02:29:03.684
- No!
- Well, you did!

2051
02:29:06.612 --> 02:29:08.532
Just... couple of sticks
of dynamite, that's all.

2052
02:29:09.677 --> 02:29:13.038
How much noise could it make?
Boom. It's all over.

2053
02:29:13.638 --> 02:29:15.673
Get it over right! Get it over!

2054
02:29:15.728 --> 02:29:18.845
Left rudder!
Too low! Up, up! Pull up!

2055
02:29:18.935 --> 02:29:20.800
No! Left rudder! No!

2056
02:29:21.043 --> 02:29:23.093
No! No-no-no! Pull it up!

2057
02:29:23.671 --> 02:29:24.856
HEEELP!!

2058
02:29:28.486 --> 02:29:30.410
Help! I'm the Colonel, you know!

2059
02:29:30.551 --> 02:29:34.082
Help! Help! Help me! Get me down!

2060
02:29:37.161 --> 02:29:39.329
We're not going to land
and we'll never make it!

2061
02:29:39.374 --> 02:29:41.777
- We'll never make it!
- What do you mean, we'll never make it?

2062
02:29:41.801 --> 02:29:45.173
Don't freeze! Benjy!
Benjy, don't freeze!

2063
02:29:49.215 --> 02:29:50.420
This one's gonna work.

2064
02:29:50.944 --> 02:29:52.826
- Damn it, come to!
- You hit me!

2065
02:29:52.905 --> 02:29:55.024
Listen, wake up! Hey! What...?!

2066
02:30:02.236 --> 02:30:03.236
We're down!

2067
02:30:04.049 --> 02:30:06.127
- We're on the ground.
- Hooray!

2068
02:30:06.190 --> 02:30:09.276
It's just a noise, that's all.
It's way over there.

2069
02:30:13.948 --> 02:30:16.411
- Put on the brakes!
- The brakes, okay. Where are they?

2070
02:30:16.466 --> 02:30:18.794
Benjy! Here comes a restaurant!

2071
02:30:26.164 --> 02:30:27.863
That's it, we've landed! Come on!

2072
02:30:34.343 --> 02:30:36.564
Come on. Hurry. Now, hurry up!

2073
02:30:36.954 --> 02:30:39.134
- Come on! Come on, let's go!
- Hey, ah... what about him?

2074
02:30:39.158 --> 02:30:41.152
Never mind about him. There
must be an ambulance around,

2075
02:30:41.176 --> 02:30:42.723
let's get out of here, come on!

2076
02:30:45.104 --> 02:30:48.903
Cab! Hey, cab! Cab! Cab!

2077
02:30:50.659 --> 02:30:53.420
Listen! We're in an awful hurry!
Do you know where the State Park is?!

2078
02:30:53.448 --> 02:30:55.362
Sure! What happened?!

2079
02:30:55.675 --> 02:30:57.544
We had an emergency landing!
Come on, hurry!

2080
02:30:57.615 --> 02:30:59.333
Quick, let's go! Come on, get in!

2081
02:30:59.490 --> 02:31:00.607
Come on, Benjy!

2082
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:15.670
Oh! Excuse me.

2083
02:31:21.312 --> 02:31:22.650
Excuse us. Here's your bag.

2084
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:26.830
You see, the... the lock didn't work.

2085
02:31:27.188 --> 02:31:28.230
Let's go.

2086
02:31:28.272 --> 02:31:30.522
That's-that's all. The owners will
pay for everything.

2087
02:31:30.568 --> 02:31:32.335
The owners will pay for everything,
the- the owners...

2088
02:31:32.359 --> 02:31:34.694
Next door, he'll pay, buddy,
that's all. It's okay.

2089
02:31:43.329 --> 02:31:44.956
Hey! Hey, you people. You!

2090
02:31:44.997 --> 02:31:46.698
Come back here. Come back!

2091
02:31:47.124 --> 02:31:48.524
You-- you vandals!

2092
02:31:48.954 --> 02:31:52.035
The cops in this town
are morons, retarded!

2093
02:31:52.512 --> 02:31:54.535
I'm dealing with moronic people!

2094
02:31:54.632 --> 02:31:58.806
'Cause he's in a bad humor,
that fat Nazi! What, I gotta suffer
because o'him?!

2095
02:31:58.868 --> 02:32:01.104
What's the matter, get away from me [...]!
What's the matter?

2096
02:32:01.128 --> 02:32:03.546
- Are you freak?
- Can't you see I'm talkin on the phone?!

2097
02:32:03.947 --> 02:32:05.760
- Huh?! Gimme two minutes!

2098
02:32:06.228 --> 02:32:07.799
Now, listen to me, Sy...

2099
02:32:08.339 --> 02:32:10.261
Will you take us to
Santa Rosita State Park?!

2100
02:32:11.148 --> 02:32:13.681
What's the matter, what happened to you?
There was some kind of Initiation?

2101
02:32:13.705 --> 02:32:15.986
We had an accident, followed the Yellow,
alright? Hurry up!

2102
02:32:16.552 --> 02:32:19.195
<i>Benjamin and Bell stopped
at a gardener supply place</i>

2103
02:32:19.281 --> 02:32:21.161
<i>on Ocean Boulevard
and bought picks and shovels.</i>

2104
02:32:21.234 --> 02:32:23.681
<i>Wait, hold it, Chief.
Here's a report on the Crumps.</i>

2105
02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:28.403
<i>Their cab has turned onto 101,
moving south, he's moving towards
your present position.</i>

2106
02:32:28.497 --> 02:32:32.566
<i>Well, wait, wait a minute! The other taxi
is also turning onto... they're on 101,</i>

2107
02:32:32.730 --> 02:32:35.802
<i>and they're moving north. They're both
moving in your position, Chief!</i>

2108
02:32:35.896 --> 02:32:38.029
Understood. Stand by.

2109
02:32:38.843 --> 02:32:41.267
- They oughtta be here any minute, Chief.
- Uh-huh.

2110
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:07.652
Look. It's those two idiots,

2111
02:33:08.074 --> 02:33:10.498
the little one and the one with the
marbles in his mouth.

2112
02:33:10.576 --> 02:33:12.898
- Hey! It's that hokey dentist!
- Yeah.

2113
02:33:13.586 --> 02:33:14.627
Pass that cab!

2114
02:33:14.713 --> 02:33:16.526
- What's the rush?
- What do you mean "rush"?!

2115
02:33:16.565 --> 02:33:18.605
We ain't in any rush, we wanna
get there in a hurry!

2116
02:33:27.508 --> 02:33:28.508
Culpepper.

2117
02:33:29.204 --> 02:33:30.204
Now!

2118
02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:32.196
Give the order to pull away.

2119
02:33:38.971 --> 02:33:41.587
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Are you sure you don't want me
to wait around?

2120
02:33:41.611 --> 02:33:42.416
No, no. Here's $ 5.

2121
02:33:42.486 --> 02:33:45.686
- Hey, what's with the pick and shovel?
- You go mind your own business! Come on.

2122
02:33:49.115 --> 02:33:50.357
Hey! Hey!

2123
02:33:52.544 --> 02:33:54.700
- Think anybody else is here?
- Didn't see any cars outside.

2124
02:33:54.724 --> 02:33:56.241
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Aahh!

2125
02:33:56.945 --> 02:33:59.311
- Let's talk this over, huh?
- I got nothing to talk with you about.

2126
02:33:59.335 --> 02:34:00.655
Now, wait a minute!
Wait a minute.

2127
02:34:00.704 --> 02:34:02.470
What-- you think anybody else
has been here?

2128
02:34:02.728 --> 02:34:05.178
- How should I know? Come on, Monica!
- Wait a minute!

2129
02:34:05.346 --> 02:34:07.807
If you think we're really the first ones
here, why not make a deal?

2130
02:34:07.849 --> 02:34:08.849
The four of us.

2131
02:34:08.891 --> 02:34:11.690
You don't know where to look,
we don't know where to look,
so we'll look together.

2132
02:34:11.714 --> 02:34:13.392
We'll find it before the others.

2133
02:34:13.779 --> 02:34:15.639
Incidentally, where
are all the others?

2134
02:34:16.297 --> 02:34:19.259
How come you two just got here?
You had the plane.

2135
02:34:20.184 --> 02:34:23.547
Yyeeah... What happened to you?

2136
02:34:24.030 --> 02:34:26.783
They're up to something funny,
you hear what I'm telling you?

2137
02:34:26.951 --> 02:34:29.082
Now, did you see the blonde I brought?

2138
02:34:29.106 --> 02:34:30.883
Covered up with paint,
with her dress ripped?

2139
02:34:30.937 --> 02:34:32.292
Now what's that all about?

2140
02:34:32.665 --> 02:34:36.050
Yeeah! And what about
the picks and shovels?

2141
02:34:36.850 --> 02:34:39.716
Sort of piques your curiosity, don't it?

2142
02:34:50.316 --> 02:34:53.478
Now you better run back to headquarters.
Wait till you hear from me.

2143
02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:57.328
- Oh, let me go with you, Chief.
- No, I'd like to, but it might
snarl things up a little.

2144
02:34:58.692 --> 02:34:59.965
Thanks for everything.

2145
02:35:00.629 --> 02:35:02.076
Lots o' luck, Chief.

2146
02:35:37.314 --> 02:35:40.275
Benjy! Did you see anything, pal?

2147
02:35:40.442 --> 02:35:43.403
No, but there must be something somewhere.

2148
02:35:43.452 --> 02:35:45.882
Hey, hey... HEEY!! Hey!

2149
02:35:45.978 --> 02:35:48.658
- Wait a minute. Did you see anything?
- Nothing, not a thing!

2150
02:35:48.826 --> 02:35:51.995
Are you sure he didn't say something
else, something you've forgotten?

2151
02:35:52.162 --> 02:35:55.492
He said it's will be buried under
a Big W, and that we'd see it.

2152
02:35:55.633 --> 02:35:58.242
- Yeah, well, it's gotta be here.
- Look, I tell you what we do.

2153
02:35:58.328 --> 02:36:00.712
You go to way we came, and
we'll go the way you came.

2154
02:36:00.879 --> 02:36:02.795
We might have missed something. Hold it.

2155
02:36:04.341 --> 02:36:06.101
You go the way we came...
and we'll go...

2156
02:36:06.218 --> 02:36:07.866
That's right! Okay, let's go.

2157
02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:18.498
They're looking for something that is
buried under something called "a Big W".

2158
02:36:18.522 --> 02:36:21.147
I heard one of them, the nut,
the stutterer, I heard him say it.

2159
02:36:21.389 --> 02:36:23.438
Yeah, I heard! But what?!

2160
02:37:13.744 --> 02:37:15.824
- Did you see anything yet?
- No. Did you see anything?

2161
02:37:15.848 --> 02:37:18.998
Nothing. Well, that guy hid it so good,
I bet he couldn't even find it himself.

2162
02:37:19.100 --> 02:37:20.217
I think that we...

2163
02:37:30.054 --> 02:37:32.161
- Who's he?
- I don't know.

2164
02:37:32.429 --> 02:37:34.220
But he had a shovel.

2165
02:37:34.369 --> 02:37:36.134
Oh, maybe he was a prospector,
or something?

2166
02:37:36.275 --> 02:37:38.293
- What are you talking...
- We're wasting time.

2167
02:37:38.386 --> 02:37:42.154
- Harder! We gotta look harder!
- Let's look harder. Come on, let's go!

2168
02:37:54.652 --> 02:37:57.498
- Who's he?
- I don't know, but he hadn't
got a shovel!

2169
02:38:05.255 --> 02:38:07.355
- Melville, I've got it.
- You've got it?

2170
02:38:07.476 --> 02:38:11.076
Yes, yes, when we were kids and we
lost something, all we did was close
our eyes real tight,

2171
02:38:11.384 --> 02:38:15.930
then turn around three times fast and
walk straight ahead, and open your eyes,
and there it was, it was always there!

2172
02:38:15.954 --> 02:38:18.675
Monica, that's kids' stuff. We're looking
for the Big W, don't you understand?

2173
02:38:18.761 --> 02:38:20.786
- Can't do any harm,
we haven't done it yet.
- Monica, what are you...

2174
02:38:20.810 --> 02:38:22.296
Just don't worry, and let me try.

2175
02:38:22.991 --> 02:38:23.991
One...

2176
02:38:25.212 --> 02:38:26.255
...two...

2177
02:38:27.274 --> 02:38:28.274
...three!

2178
02:38:28.662 --> 02:38:30.962
And now I walk straight ahead!

2179
02:38:34.335 --> 02:38:35.734
MONICA!!

2180
02:38:41.633 --> 02:38:44.604
Monica! Monica! I can't understand,
why you did that.

2181
02:38:44.682 --> 02:38:46.122
- What's the matter with you?
- Oh...

2182
02:38:46.376 --> 02:38:48.535
Monica, will you- will you stop
playing games?

2183
02:38:48.613 --> 02:38:51.133
- But it always worked when we were kids!
- Ah, here's your bag.

2184
02:38:51.168 --> 02:38:53.214
Come on, let's go. Hurry up, eh?

2185
02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:56.131
Hurry up!

2186
02:39:14.007 --> 02:39:16.701
- He's here, I tell ya.
- Yes, sir. That's his car!

2187
02:39:16.869 --> 02:39:18.441
Well, wouldn't I like to put
my hands on that phony!

2188
02:39:18.465 --> 02:39:20.207
Somebody must've come in those cabs.
Come on, men!

2189
02:39:20.231 --> 02:39:23.272
- Let's get moving now, let's get moving!
- Let's get moving, come on,
let's get moving!

2190
02:39:23.296 --> 02:39:26.461
- Yes, yes, the tools must be here.
- They'd better be! Come on, Emeline!

2191
02:39:26.517 --> 02:39:29.255
- You not just gonna sit there!
- You not just gonna sit there...

2192
02:39:29.393 --> 02:39:31.137
- Yes, I am.
- Come on, mother...

2193
02:39:31.208 --> 02:39:32.614
Then sit, Emeline!

2194
02:39:33.398 --> 02:39:36.194
Mrs. Finch, aren't you
the teeniest bit curious?

2195
02:39:36.312 --> 02:39:40.558
No. I'm not even curious,
Mr. Hawthorne, just disgusted.

2196
02:39:40.726 --> 02:39:43.830
I say, that really is a pity.
Do forgive me, I must go.

2197
02:39:54.156 --> 02:39:56.454
You are the [...], you wouldn't
know a Big W if you saw one!

2198
02:39:56.478 --> 02:39:57.992
- I know a...
- Shut up [...]!

2199
02:39:58.389 --> 02:40:00.967
I don't care what you say,
I don't think they got here yet.

2200
02:40:01.068 --> 02:40:03.711
They're here somewhere!
That means they haven't found it!

2201
02:40:03.789 --> 02:40:06.217
You sure that's all that guy said? 
"They are under a Big W"?

2202
02:40:06.241 --> 02:40:08.525
Well, actually, it was after that,
when I joined the party.

2203
02:40:08.635 --> 02:40:11.172
Yes, sir, by God that's what he said,
"It was under a Big W".

2204
02:40:11.254 --> 02:40:14.262
<i>- Let's look over there.
- Will you shut up and follow me?!</i>

2205
02:41:09.148 --> 02:41:10.440
- Who are they?
- I don't know!

2206
02:41:10.533 --> 02:41:11.900
- From this morning?
- Yeah.

2207
02:41:14.926 --> 02:41:16.510
- Who's he?
- I don't know.

2208
02:41:18.552 --> 02:41:20.366
- Who's he?
- I don't know!

2209
02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:22.632
Mama, how many people
are mixed up in this thing?

2210
02:41:24.496 --> 02:41:29.097
Mama, who are they? Cabbies?
Oh my, this thing's like a convention.

2211
02:42:06.068 --> 02:42:09.216
Is anything wrong, ma'am? I- I didn't
mean to startle you. Are you all right?

2212
02:42:09.310 --> 02:42:12.921
Who are you? Are- are you with
the others, the ones that are looking?

2213
02:42:13.015 --> 02:42:15.402
- Well, I am, in a way. Aren't you?
- No!

2214
02:42:15.612 --> 02:42:18.925
I mean, I didn't want to have anything
to do with it, right from the start.

2215
02:42:19.093 --> 02:42:20.775
And you know what?

2216
02:42:20.853 --> 02:42:25.503
I know where it is. I'm the only one
that knows where it is, and I wasn't
even looking!

2217
02:42:25.644 --> 02:42:29.310
- Um, you know where it is? - Yes!
- You sure? - I don't know what I should do.

2218
02:42:32.898 --> 02:42:35.024
Come on out, all of you!
This is ridiculous!

2219
02:42:35.192 --> 02:42:37.498
- I absolutely agree with you, Mrs. Marcus.
- Oh, come on out!

2220
02:42:37.522 --> 02:42:40.055
We all know we're all here,
and nobody's fooling anybody!

2221
02:42:40.133 --> 02:42:41.674
Okay, so we all know! So what?!

2222
02:42:41.729 --> 02:42:44.098
Don't you talk to my Mama
in that tone of voice, you hear?

2223
02:42:44.208 --> 02:42:45.405
- You hear?
- Shut up!

2224
02:42:45.499 --> 02:42:49.670
Hey, listen, let me tell you something.
We ain't the only ones here. I've seen
at least four or five other guys.

2225
02:42:49.694 --> 02:42:51.328
That's right. Those two cab drivers,
I saw them.

2226
02:42:51.352 --> 02:42:54.088
- Oh, they came with us and that dentist.
- You wanna start?!

2227
02:42:54.323 --> 02:42:57.481
- Yes, I wanna...
- Look, why are we wasting
so much time?!

2228
02:42:57.645 --> 02:42:59.585
We all know that we're all here.
And we all know,

2229
02:42:59.717 --> 02:43:01.254
that even if somebody
finds the money,

2230
02:43:01.278 --> 02:43:04.789
nobody's gonna get away with
it unless everybody gets a share!

2231
02:43:05.078 --> 02:43:08.041
So look, why don't we all get sensible
and get this thing organized?!

2232
02:43:08.143 --> 02:43:11.458
- Did you all hear what Mama said?
- Yeah. Come on, Mother.

2233
02:43:12.460 --> 02:43:13.771
Now, um, now wait a minute.

2234
02:43:13.795 --> 02:43:17.191
Did any- any of you, anybody
see a- a guy with glasses...

2235
02:43:17.359 --> 02:43:19.697
with a real sneery expression
on his face?

2236
02:43:19.791 --> 02:43:23.066
I mean, like, this guy was ugly.
I mean, like, real ugly.

2237
02:43:27.559 --> 02:43:29.202
And if you help dig it up...

2238
02:43:29.334 --> 02:43:31.608
you can have half
and I'll have half.

2239
02:43:31.733 --> 02:43:34.282
Is that okay? I mean, is that fair?

2240
02:43:35.102 --> 02:43:36.673
Because if I have half of the money...

2241
02:43:37.612 --> 02:43:41.004
I can go away somewhere
where nobody can find me.

2242
02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:45.785
Not Russell or my mother...
or Sylvester, anybody.

2243
02:43:46.888 --> 02:43:48.771
You don't know what that'd mean.

2244
02:43:49.396 --> 02:43:50.796
Why, if I had enough money,

2245
02:43:50.890 --> 02:43:53.587
I might even be able to live
in a convent or something.

2246
02:43:54.501 --> 02:43:55.772
- In a convent?
- Uh-huh.

2247
02:43:56.899 --> 02:43:59.042
Now we all know that
we're all here, right?

2248
02:43:59.393 --> 02:44:01.149
Now it only seems
intelligent to me,

2249
02:44:01.173 --> 02:44:04.792
that we should all share in one
equal share apiece, is that right?

2250
02:44:04.863 --> 02:44:08.334
- Right. Melville's right.
- So, we all know that! Look, if...
there always...

2251
02:44:09.246 --> 02:44:13.637
- Oh, no. Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hm.
- It's him, all right. Yeah!

2252
02:44:15.125 --> 02:44:17.963
You got this wrong!
I came to apologize!

2253
02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:21.547
Forgive and forget! I'm your friend!
I know that you got...

2254
02:44:21.715 --> 02:44:25.051
- He's so neurotic! Can't you do something?
- I'll get you.

2255
02:44:25.219 --> 02:44:29.690
- He's very neurotic. I'm your friend!
- When I get my hands on you,
I tell you, I'll...

2256
02:44:41.372 --> 02:44:42.473
Well, that's it!

2257
02:44:42.739 --> 02:44:44.481
Sure! Look!

2258
02:44:44.947 --> 02:44:46.906
It's the Big W, I tell you!

2259
02:44:47.277 --> 02:44:49.215
It's the Big W!

2260
02:44:51.787 --> 02:44:52.695
<i>Look at this!</i>

2261
02:44:52.758 --> 02:44:54.666
<i>- Look at it!
- He's right! It's a Big W!</i>

2262
02:45:00.009 --> 02:45:01.701
I'm sorry, Mrs. Finch.

2263
02:45:03.269 --> 02:45:04.792
I'm afraid it's too late.

2264
02:45:05.563 --> 02:45:06.944
I think they've found it.

2265
02:45:08.729 --> 02:45:12.140
Right here all the time!
He wasn't kidding!

2266
02:45:12.307 --> 02:45:16.477
- He was telling the truth!
- Folks, isn't this great?

2267
02:45:17.146 --> 02:45:19.671
Congratulations. Well done.

2268
02:45:20.107 --> 02:45:23.562
Listen, I think the big boy here should
get an extra share from all of us.

2269
02:45:23.703 --> 02:45:25.862
After all, it was he who found it.

2270
02:45:26.029 --> 02:45:29.282
Yes! I insist! He gets an extra share.

2271
02:45:29.450 --> 02:45:31.179
<i>That's right. He deserves
an extra share.</i>

2272
02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:34.495
- Well, I...
- Look, why don't we just
start digging, for...

2273
02:45:34.595 --> 02:45:36.660
I suppose somebody comes along.
What do we tell him?

2274
02:45:36.769 --> 02:45:39.943
Well, we could just say that we're here
with an anthropological expedition.

2275
02:45:40.099 --> 02:45:41.771
- Naaah!
- Now we don't tell them anything!

2276
02:45:41.795 --> 02:45:44.203
We tell them to hit the road,
or we beat their brains in!

2277
02:45:44.844 --> 02:45:46.516
Yeah, it was a nice dream.

2278
02:45:48.103 --> 02:45:50.094
Lasted almost five minutes.

2279
02:46:00.105 --> 02:46:01.802
Now, don't bug me, I said!

2280
02:46:02.607 --> 02:46:03.677
Faster.

2281
02:46:04.248 --> 02:46:06.016
Faster-faster, dig, dig.

2282
02:46:06.278 --> 02:46:07.906
Faster! Faster!

2283
02:46:08.512 --> 02:46:09.512
Faster.

2284
02:46:09.624 --> 02:46:11.282
Dig. That's it, dig.

2285
02:47:06.195 --> 02:47:07.296
Faster!

2286
02:47:20.741 --> 02:47:24.021
Not enough room, there's not enough
room. You two, out, out, come on!

2287
02:47:24.189 --> 02:47:26.140
How, just get out!
Come on, let us do it.

2288
02:47:32.114 --> 02:47:35.881
Wait a minute, wait a minute. There's not
enough room. Man, you're bugging me,
you're bugging me!

2289
02:47:35.905 --> 02:47:38.012
- What did you tell about "bugging"?
- Cut, cut out, cut out.

2290
02:47:38.036 --> 02:47:40.616
- What is this "cut out" talk?
- Out, baby. Out, baby, out!

2291
02:47:40.761 --> 02:47:42.060
Don't call me "baby".

2292
02:47:42.146 --> 02:47:44.420
Quit arguing, will ya? Come on!

2293
02:47:56.054 --> 02:47:58.103
- What's that?
- What was that?

2294
02:48:00.142 --> 02:48:01.995
- That's it.
- I mean, I can hear a chest,
did you hear that?

2295
02:48:02.019 --> 02:48:04.372
- Hey! I can hear [...] it's a chest!
- I wonder what's in it...

2296
02:48:04.396 --> 02:48:06.193
Hey! Bring it up here!

2297
02:48:13.071 --> 02:48:14.071
There it is!

2298
02:48:15.324 --> 02:48:16.885
- It's a satchel!
- Hold it up!

2299
02:48:16.909 --> 02:48:18.264
HOLD IIIT!!

2300
02:48:18.660 --> 02:48:21.342
- It's a satchel!
- Yeah, I got it.

2301
02:48:22.915 --> 02:48:24.165
Open it. Open it up!

2302
02:48:24.333 --> 02:48:25.666
Quicker, come on!

2303
02:48:28.648 --> 02:48:29.648
BINGO!!

2304
02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:33.754
I say- I say, chaps! Don't you think
we oughtta find a spot of cover?!

2305
02:48:33.793 --> 02:48:35.009
No, there's nobody around.

2306
02:48:35.177 --> 02:48:36.821
Come on, come on.
Count it out, count it out!

2307
02:48:36.845 --> 02:48:39.093
- What are we waiting for?
- Now wait a second!

2308
02:48:39.171 --> 02:48:43.517
Everybody's going to get something, so
no arguments. We all get equal shares!

2309
02:48:43.547 --> 02:48:44.579
- Yeah.
- He's right.

2310
02:48:45.020 --> 02:48:47.939
That's the only way to do it.
Shares for everybody!

2311
02:48:48.106 --> 02:48:49.311
Now, how many are we?

2312
02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:52.276
1... 2...

2313
02:48:52.444 --> 02:48:56.739
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

2314
02:48:57.616 --> 02:49:02.370
9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

2315
02:49:02.537 --> 02:49:04.664
14, 15.

2316
02:49:04.915 --> 02:49:07.667
15 of us. That means 15 equal shares.

2317
02:49:07.761 --> 02:49:11.295
Oh, you dirty double-crosser.
You cut yourself in for twice!

2318
02:49:11.380 --> 02:49:13.335
You can't get away with that!

2319
02:49:13.421 --> 02:49:14.687
- This man...
- Get him!

2320
02:49:14.984 --> 02:49:17.927
Grab him! Grab him!
Get him, get him, get him!

2321
02:49:20.013 --> 02:49:23.398
You didn't cheat anybody but yourself
because now you're out.

2322
02:49:23.531 --> 02:49:27.353
Listen! Listen! You can't
cut me out now, you hear?

2323
02:49:27.521 --> 02:49:29.271
Not after what I've been through!

2324
02:49:30.232 --> 02:49:32.816
All right. Okay. I'm warning you:

2325
02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:35.874
if I don't get a share, I'm gonna go
straight to the police!

2326
02:49:35.991 --> 02:49:39.448
- The police? What's the matter...
- What makes you think the police...

2327
02:49:39.876 --> 02:49:42.326
What about that money?! It had
to come from somewhere.

2328
02:49:42.378 --> 02:49:44.148
We know where it come from:

2329
02:49:44.172 --> 02:49:46.747
that poor old man who died up
there on the mountain this morning.

2330
02:49:46.888 --> 02:49:48.902
You wasn't even there, so shut up!

2331
02:49:49.051 --> 02:49:53.045
Alright, okay, you asked for it.
I'm gonna go straight to the police!

2332
02:49:53.108 --> 02:49:55.673
What makes you think the police
would be interested, Mr. Meyer?

2333
02:49:55.782 --> 02:49:58.300
Are you kidding? Isn't it obvious?!

2334
02:49:58.409 --> 02:50:00.222
How do you think money gets... Wait...

2335
02:50:03.473 --> 02:50:04.577
How did you know my name?

2336
02:50:04.936 --> 02:50:06.209
You know this crook?

2337
02:50:06.945 --> 02:50:11.421
Well, I've never actually met him,
Mr. Pike, but I've come to feel
that I know him.

2338
02:50:12.607 --> 02:50:15.609
How did you know my name?
I don't [...] about met you any place.

2339
02:50:15.777 --> 02:50:18.164
Yeah... yeah, who are you?

2340
02:50:18.490 --> 02:50:20.383
We thought he came with you,
didn't he come with you?

2341
02:50:20.407 --> 02:50:23.325
No, he didn't come with us, I mean,
um... we thought he came with you.

2342
02:50:23.493 --> 02:50:24.307
Naah!

2343
02:50:24.472 --> 02:50:27.077
Well, if he didn't come with
you nor with us, well then...

2344
02:50:27.706 --> 02:50:29.165
...well then, who are you?

2345
02:50:29.926 --> 02:50:31.678
I'm Capt. Culpepper.

2346
02:50:32.294 --> 02:50:34.420
Of Santa Rosita Police Department.

2347
02:50:43.946 --> 02:50:48.034
Captain Culpepper is the best
single policeman in the history
of this department!

2348
02:50:48.347 --> 02:50:50.341
He has the best record in the force!

2349
02:50:50.443 --> 02:50:53.240
He is the only completely
honest man I ever met!

2350
02:50:53.589 --> 02:50:56.888
So, as a reward for
a lifetime service...

2351
02:50:56.950 --> 02:51:01.202
he gets pushed around now, by you and
a crummy crowd <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>of crooked councilmen!</u></font>

2352
02:51:01.472 --> 02:51:04.393
<i>- Oh, will you come to the point?</i>
- Yeah-yeah-yeah, I'm coming to the point.

2353
02:51:04.417 --> 02:51:08.114
The point is that I have enough
stuff in my private file.

2354
02:51:08.246 --> 02:51:12.133
Stuff relating to, um, civic building,
road contracts,

2355
02:51:12.157 --> 02:51:14.155
harbor and cannery projects,

2356
02:51:14.351 --> 02:51:16.994
enough stuff to put you,
the D.A., myself...

2357
02:51:17.119 --> 02:51:21.371
and a two-thirds majority
behind bars for the next 20 years.

2358
02:51:21.490 --> 02:51:25.278
And I give you my word, that that's
exactly where everybody is going,

2359
02:51:25.446 --> 02:51:30.180
- unless certain things start
happening now!
<i>- Like what, for instance?</i>

2360
02:51:30.305 --> 02:51:33.284
I want the pension for
Culpepper's grade trebled.

2361
02:51:33.416 --> 02:51:37.649
Not doubled, trebled. I want
Culpepper to retire with honor!

2362
02:51:37.930 --> 02:51:40.282
I want it on paper all
over with your signature,

2363
02:51:40.360 --> 02:51:42.104
that that's exactly
what's going to happen,

2364
02:51:42.182 --> 02:51:45.035
and I want that paper in my hands
in 15 minutes,

2365
02:51:45.121 --> 02:51:48.084
or I'll have all the reporters
in town in here in 20!

2366
02:51:48.865 --> 02:51:52.919
Now, you know the word for this,
Your Honor. It's called blackmail!

2367
02:52:11.252 --> 02:52:15.270
Sir, could you possibly see your
way clear to... give us a break?

2368
02:52:15.379 --> 02:52:17.257
You kidding? Him give you a break?!

2369
02:52:18.005 --> 02:52:19.997
Hey, we had a pretty rough day already.

2370
02:52:20.060 --> 02:52:23.664
We- we was all covered with dirt,
and we fell down in an airplane, and...

2371
02:52:24.140 --> 02:52:26.766
my grandmother's dying in Oxnard.

2372
02:52:27.539 --> 02:52:31.057
I know we don't deserve any
kindness, Captain, but-- well--

2373
02:52:31.135 --> 02:52:32.893
if you could help us,
I-I'm sure we- we'd-

2374
02:52:32.981 --> 02:52:35.482
we'd all be inspired to
go on and live better lives.

2375
02:52:35.921 --> 02:52:37.608
Well, there is one thing.

2376
02:52:38.696 --> 02:52:40.697
I don't know whether
it would help or not.

2377
02:52:41.203 --> 02:52:45.201
But... if instead of
my turning you in...

2378
02:52:45.744 --> 02:52:47.829
...you went and turned yourselves in,

2379
02:52:48.518 --> 02:52:51.955
juries sometimes look very favorably
on things like that.

2380
02:52:52.325 --> 02:52:54.811
You- you'd- you'd let us--
you'd let us do that?

2381
02:52:54.891 --> 02:52:57.088
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's turn ourselves in!

2382
02:52:57.838 --> 02:52:59.996
You must be a fine human being,
Sir, after all.

2383
02:53:00.090 --> 02:53:02.341
Why should you worry whether
we get a break or not?

2384
02:53:02.431 --> 02:53:07.823
Well, Mr. Meyer, no matter what
you've all done today, you're not
really criminals.

2385
02:53:08.943 --> 02:53:12.447
So if you like, you can all
hop into those two cabs and...

2386
02:53:12.740 --> 02:53:14.948
drive over to Santa Rosita...

2387
02:53:15.328 --> 02:53:18.026
and, um, just, um... walk in.

2388
02:53:18.518 --> 02:53:22.340
- Then-then-then let's do that.
- But, sir, we can't all get into
the two cabs, can't we...

2389
02:53:22.404 --> 02:53:26.665
Well, you can't take the stolen
vehicles. Those have to stay here
to be picked up later.

2390
02:53:26.821 --> 02:53:29.198
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Let's go before he...

2391
02:53:29.307 --> 02:53:30.722
Let's go, let's go...

2392
02:53:31.403 --> 02:53:32.707
Back in the back.

2393
02:53:36.320 --> 02:53:37.430
Drive carefully.

2394
02:53:37.539 --> 02:53:39.985
They may be the last passengers
you'll ever carry.

2395
02:53:40.180 --> 02:53:43.143
Funny. That's funny.
Funny, right? Funny?

2396
02:53:43.252 --> 02:53:45.567
You could be the most
comical cop I ever met.

2397
02:53:46.324 --> 02:53:47.324
Yeah.

2398
02:54:14.771 --> 02:54:16.411
- Culpepper.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

2399
02:54:17.732 --> 02:54:19.713
Everything is under control here.

2400
02:54:19.880 --> 02:54:23.405
It'll take a little longer, because
there was a joker in the deck

2401
02:54:23.539 --> 02:54:25.564
that nobody knew about. Right?

2402
02:54:26.010 --> 02:54:27.010
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

2403
02:54:27.879 --> 02:54:30.856
So don't make a move of any kind
until you hear from me.

2404
02:54:31.059 --> 02:54:32.059
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

2405
02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:53.751
Boy, if only everybody had listened
to me this morning, we wouldn't have
been in this predicament.

2406
02:54:54.166 --> 02:54:56.193
Why? What did you say this morning?

2407
02:54:56.599 --> 02:54:58.984
What I said was, everybody should
share 25 equal...

2408
02:54:59.070 --> 02:55:00.954
- Oh, come on...
- Not that awful...

2409
02:55:02.031 --> 02:55:05.547
No matter what you've all done
today, you're really not criminal!

2410
02:55:05.775 --> 02:55:10.215
Ah! Of all that snooty, patronizing...
YOU'RE STEPPING ON MY FOOT!!

2411
02:55:10.324 --> 02:55:12.157
Will you get off <font color="#FAAAAA"><u>my Mama's foot!</u></font>

2412
02:55:18.489 --> 02:55:22.311
Listen, why does the man want
to give everybody a break? Huh?

2413
02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:25.438
- What's his angle there?
- Yeah, I was wondering about that, too.

2414
02:55:25.547 --> 02:55:27.522
There's something very
funny going on here.

2415
02:55:27.546 --> 02:55:29.329
How does he know what we're gonna do?

2416
02:55:29.376 --> 02:55:32.043
Look, we're in enough of a mess.
We better do just what he said.

2417
02:55:32.126 --> 02:55:34.456
I'm tellin' you, the man
has got some kind of angle.

2418
02:55:34.511 --> 02:55:36.432
Now wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold it! Hold it!

2419
02:55:36.456 --> 02:55:37.799
What is it, can you see him?

2420
02:55:47.639 --> 02:55:49.622
So just what does he think he is doing?

2421
02:55:49.646 --> 02:55:51.804
- That certainly is strange.
- Sure is.

2422
02:55:51.867 --> 02:55:53.593
- What is he doing?
- What's he doing?

2423
02:55:53.656 --> 02:55:56.642
- He's going the other way!
- Why are we standing here?!

2424
02:55:57.278 --> 02:55:58.361
That's it!

2425
02:56:00.202 --> 02:56:02.397
We're off the hook!
We're off the hook!

2426
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:05.739
- I'm getting outta here!
- Come on, we're off!

2427
02:56:05.854 --> 02:56:07.787
Come on, get going!

2428
02:56:19.965 --> 02:56:20.706
Ah!

2429
02:56:20.811 --> 02:56:23.131
Holy mackerel!
I almost didn't make it.

2430
02:56:38.096 --> 02:56:40.520
No other cops around. He planned it.

2431
02:56:40.653 --> 02:56:42.391
We were the only ones who
know where the money was.

2432
02:56:42.415 --> 02:56:44.605
He was waiting around
to take it away from us.

2433
02:56:44.792 --> 02:56:48.958
Yeah! But if we find all the money
first and we turn it in, then we're all
be in the clear.

2434
02:56:49.044 --> 02:56:52.179
So, let's just get the dough
and worry about the rest later.

2435
02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:55.927
- Look! He's slowing down!
- No-no, he's gonna turn off to the left.

2436
02:57:48.472 --> 02:57:51.269
- What's going on?
- Sorry, Jimmy!

2437
02:58:43.707 --> 02:58:45.308
He's heading for the border!

2438
02:58:45.704 --> 02:58:48.156
Listen! We should stop and call
the police station!

2439
02:58:48.323 --> 02:58:49.145
You shut up!

2440
02:58:49.216 --> 02:58:51.622
We're gonna get that money!
Keep driving!

2441
02:58:52.241 --> 02:58:54.148
That woman is something else!

2442
02:58:54.946 --> 02:58:56.729
Will ya take your foot
off the brake?! Let's go!

2443
02:58:56.753 --> 02:58:58.239
Stop hitting me. I'm driving! Ouch!

2444
02:58:58.310 --> 02:59:01.786
- Whenever you want a cab,
you can't get one!
- Yeah, come on, let's go, come on!

2445
02:59:10.990 --> 02:59:14.062
<i>- F-14 to Central.</i>
- Come in, F-14. What is it?

2446
02:59:14.288 --> 02:59:16.185
<i>We think there's something phony here.</i>

2447
02:59:16.256 --> 02:59:19.078
<i>We're on 101 by Cortez,
checking a mad-dog report.</i>

2448
02:59:19.195 --> 02:59:21.055
Orders were to maintain silence.

2449
02:59:21.125 --> 02:59:23.189
Capt. Culpepper wants
this channel kept clear.

2450
02:59:23.689 --> 02:59:25.589
<i>We know it, but we saw
Capt. Culpepper.</i>

2451
02:59:25.668 --> 02:59:28.503
<i>He just went by, he's doing
90 miles an hour.</i>

2452
02:59:29.347 --> 02:59:31.654
I don't think I understand that, 14.

2453
02:59:32.326 --> 02:59:34.872
- Are you sure it was Capt. Culpepper?
<i>- Yep.</i>

2454
02:59:34.997 --> 02:59:36.914
- W- was he chasing anybody?
<i>- Nope.</i>

2455
02:59:36.976 --> 02:59:38.759
Could he have been
chasing anybody?

2456
02:59:38.830 --> 02:59:42.252
- Chief, there's the Mayor. - Aahh...
<i>- Not a chance. That's what struck us
so funny.</i>

2457
02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:45.463
<i>There were about 15 people
in two cabs, right behind 'im.</i>

2458
02:59:45.631 --> 02:59:47.507
<i>It looked like they were chasing him!</i>

2459
02:59:47.675 --> 02:59:50.474
They were... chasing him?
Hey, what's going on here?

2460
02:59:50.700 --> 02:59:53.429
I brought it myself.
Everything you asked for.

2461
02:59:53.515 --> 02:59:54.345
- The pension?
- Yeah.

2462
02:59:54.408 --> 02:59:56.830
- Call him! Try to get Capt. Culpepper!
- Yes.

2463
02:59:56.955 --> 02:59:59.982
Calling Capt. Culpepper.
Central Division. Urgent.

2464
03:00:00.551 --> 03:00:03.209
Calling Capt. Culpepper.
Capt. Culpepper!

2465
03:00:12.089 --> 03:00:15.628
- This can only happen in America.
- You going to start that again?

2466
03:00:47.078 --> 03:00:50.095
You've got to believe me.
I'm going to be sick!

2467
03:02:03.015 --> 03:02:06.265
What's the matter with you? You crazy
or something? You're trying to kill us?

2468
03:02:06.518 --> 03:02:09.158
Don't make me nervous!
Just don't make me nervous!

2469
03:02:43.517 --> 03:02:45.941
- Don't let him get away!
- Cut him off!

2470
03:02:49.011 --> 03:02:50.011
The other way!

2471
03:02:51.161 --> 03:02:55.241
<i>Calling Captain Culpepper.
Culp, this is Aloysius speaking.</i>

2472
03:02:55.421 --> 03:02:58.993
<i>Now, listen to me, Culp.
Everything has been fixed.</i>

2473
03:02:59.079 --> 03:03:01.909
<i>There's been some negotiation,
and everything is all right.</i>

2474
03:03:01.979 --> 03:03:04.464
Cut out this nonsense and answer me.

2475
03:03:04.729 --> 03:03:06.550
This is Aloysius speaking!

2476
03:03:17.282 --> 03:03:19.883
I still don't understand this.
What's it all about?

2477
03:03:21.025 --> 03:03:23.166
Well... That's it.

2478
03:03:25.993 --> 03:03:29.378
All units... arrest Capt. Culpepper.

2479
03:03:30.166 --> 03:03:31.446
Tell them.

2480
03:03:32.388 --> 03:03:35.492
Attention, all units.
Arrest Capt. Culpepper.

2481
03:03:36.148 --> 03:03:39.702
<i>This is Santa Rosita Central with orders.
Arrest Captain T. G. Culpepper.</i>

2482
03:03:39.969 --> 03:03:43.319
<i>Chief of Detectives Division
of Santa Rosita Police Department.</i>

2483
03:03:49.064 --> 03:03:50.950
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am!

2484
03:03:51.401 --> 03:03:54.486
He went that way! Get him!

Wait a minute! Men, we got him.
Now, you women stay here!

2492
03:04:31.201 --> 03:04:35.062
- What do you mean, "You women stay here"?!
- You heard what he said, mother. Stay here!

2493
03:04:35.125 --> 03:04:37.909
- Come on, come on! Let's go!
- What are you, puff?!

2494
03:04:52.390 --> 03:04:55.257
- Is he there?
- [...] watch him, watch him!
- Where'd he go?

2495
03:04:55.650 --> 03:04:57.165
Halt! Halt!

2496
03:04:57.333 --> 03:04:58.937
Now, wait a minute, listen!

2497
03:05:08.511 --> 03:05:10.136

Look! Look up there!

2500
03:06:22.940 --> 03:06:25.303
...in this regard, and
there is no doubt...

2501
03:06:31.528 --> 03:06:33.011
<i>Those ladders are not safe!</i>

2502
03:06:33.621 --> 03:06:35.722
Hey, ladders aren't safe! Get off!

2503
03:07:04.007 --> 03:07:07.740
Sylvester, what are you doing up there?
You must be out of your mind!

2504
03:07:11.230 --> 03:07:13.230
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Get the suitcase!

2505
03:07:17.031 --> 03:07:20.292
Sylvester! Come on down!

2506
03:07:20.355 --> 03:07:21.654
Don't you dare push me!

2507
03:07:21.693 --> 03:07:23.813
- Get back, lady, get back!
- Get your fingers off me!

2508
03:07:46.955 --> 03:07:49.684
You hit it off! Don't you dare
touch any of that money!

2509
03:08:01.891 --> 03:08:05.339
- Hey you! Don't stand down there! Get...
- To your right!

2510
03:08:16.901 --> 03:08:18.360
Russell, hang on!

2511
03:08:22.156 --> 03:08:24.088
Dingy, I can't hold on!

2512
03:08:26.160 --> 03:08:27.369
Help us!

2513
03:08:31.443 --> 03:08:32.975
Get off my hand!

2514
03:08:54.182 --> 03:08:55.706
Move onto the ladder!

2515
03:08:56.858 --> 03:09:00.462
Hold on! Wait a minute!
One at a time!

2516
03:09:00.548 --> 03:09:02.904
Did you hear me?
One at a time!

2517
03:09:06.128 --> 03:09:10.621
All right! Get it off!
All right, you'll see. You'll see!

2518
03:09:12.300 --> 03:09:15.112
Get on in alphabetical! I'm Benjy...

2519
03:09:15.558 --> 03:09:18.183
Will ya quit stepping on my head!

2520
03:09:18.254 --> 03:09:21.076
Get on the ladder. Get onto the ladder!

2521
03:09:22.397 --> 03:09:26.303
Don't leave me! Come back here!
You can't leave me!

2522
03:09:32.685 --> 03:09:35.270
We can't control it.
There's too many men on it.

2523
03:10:05.107 --> 03:10:07.740
Hold it steady. Watch it,
she's whipping loose!

2524
03:10:46.718 --> 03:10:49.626
Wind us down, wind us down!

2525
03:10:49.814 --> 03:10:51.993
- Bringing!
- Keep bringing [...]

2526
03:10:53.072 --> 03:10:56.126
I don't want the money!
I don't want the money! Whoa!

2527
03:10:57.718 --> 03:10:59.202
- Look out!
<i>- AAHH!!</i>

2528
03:11:08.740 --> 03:11:10.281
Get off! Get off!

2529
03:11:10.586 --> 03:11:12.539
She's going! Get out of there, calm!

2530
03:11:48.760 --> 03:11:51.543
EMELIIINE!

2531
03:11:53.162 --> 03:11:55.161
Help me, Mama!

2532
03:12:35.998 --> 03:12:37.771
It's all your fault.

2533
03:12:38.701 --> 03:12:41.039
It's all your fault right from
the beginning to the end...

2534
03:12:41.207 --> 03:12:44.376
You know... even for a policeman...

2535
03:12:44.544 --> 03:12:47.499
...your behavior was ruddy outrageous.

2536
03:12:47.839 --> 03:12:50.724
Eh, you could've taken a
fair share like the rest of us,

2537
03:12:50.802 --> 03:12:54.886
but no, you had to go and...
grab up the whole scene, baby.

2538
03:12:55.054 --> 03:13:00.350
We had 350,000 bucks,
right in our hands...

2539
03:13:00.897 --> 03:13:04.145
14 into $350,000...

2540
03:13:04.407 --> 03:13:06.606
- Oh, not again...
- Shut up!

2541
03:13:08.776 --> 03:13:11.122
I wish I knew what they will
gonna do to us.

2542
03:13:11.779 --> 03:13:17.075
But no matter what happens to us, what
happens to you, I hope will be worse!

2543
03:13:19.186 --> 03:13:21.795
I don't think you have to worry
too much about that.

2544
03:13:22.623 --> 03:13:24.583
My wife is divorcing me,

2545
03:13:25.626 --> 03:13:28.378
my mother-in-law is suing me for damages,

2546
03:13:29.940 --> 03:13:33.300
my daughter is applying to the courts
to have her name changed,

2547
03:13:34.427 --> 03:13:36.469
my pension has been revoked,

2548
03:13:36.637 --> 03:13:40.265
and the only reason...
that you 10 idiots...

2549
03:13:41.100 --> 03:13:43.891
...will very likely get off lightly...

2550
03:13:44.645 --> 03:13:48.899
...is because the judge will have
me up there to throw the book at.

2551
03:13:49.066 --> 03:13:51.326
Aw, that's tough. Oh!

2552
03:13:55.622 --> 03:14:00.076
I'd like to think that sometime,
maybe 10 or 20 years from now...

2553
03:14:01.245 --> 03:14:04.456
...there'd be something
I could laugh at... anything.

2554
03:14:14.342 --> 03:14:18.149
Now, see here, you idiots! It's all
your fault! Because if you hadn't...

2555
03:14:19.869 --> 03:14:21.429
Mama!

2556
03:14:31.859 --> 03:14:36.322
Don't you dare touch me! Get away
from me! Let me go! Leave me alone...!

2557
