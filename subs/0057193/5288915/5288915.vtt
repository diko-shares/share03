Whoa!

41
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:56.349
Did you see it,
the way he went sailing right out there?

42
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.520
- He just went sailing out there.
- It was just terrible.

43
00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:02.314
He must have been doing over 80.

44
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.567
An ambulance...
We ought to call an ambulance.

45
00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.111
Look at that car.

46
00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:11.323
He must have gone by you
doing 90 miles an hour.

47
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:14.951
He was passing me! I never saw
such a crazy thing in my life!

48
00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:17.120
- Let's get down there.
- Let's go.

49
00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.247
We're going down there.

50
00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:21.458
Russell, be careful.
Remember your condition.

51
00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.251
Eh!

52
00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:26.421
Boy, the way he just
sailed out there...

53
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.758
Look out.

54
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.262
There's nobody in the car.

55
00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.806
- He's right.
- What do you mean, nobody?

56
00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:37.891
There he is.

57
00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.893
Holy smoke!

58
00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:48.109
How about that?
This guy's still alive.

59
00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:49.653
He's still alive.

60
00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.488
We ought to call an ambulance.

61
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:54.908
I don't know how he survived, the way
you went sailing right out there.

62
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:58.203
I'm not a doctor,
but I have some medical experience.

63
00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.287
I'm a dentist.

64
00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:02.123
Do you think you're hurt real bad?

65
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.919
Is he kidding?

66
00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.338
Hold on, we're gonna get you
to a hospital.

67
00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:12.634
You move me,
I'll break up in little pieces.

68
00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.135
But what a deal.

69
00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:16.846
Look, there's this dough, see?

70
00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:20.809
There's all this dough: $350,000!

71
00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:23.186
Do you hear what I'm saying?

72
00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:26.648
$350,000!

73
00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:31.319
In the park, in Rosita,
Rosita Beach State Park...

74
00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:34.322
...just south of Dago in Santa Rosita.

75
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.576
It's in this box buried under this...

76
00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:43.373
Buried under this big W.

77
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:44.916
You'll see it.

78
00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:48.837
You'll see it under this...
under this big W.

79
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:53.258
You can't miss it, a big... a big W.

80
00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:57.470
And it's been there...
And it's been laying there for 15 years.

81
00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.932
He's very sick. He may die.

82
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.852
Listen. I tell you,
I'm giving it to you.

83
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.771
And don't let them kid you.
Don't let them kid you.

84
00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:11.693
Don't let them give you the business
because it was mine and I paid for it...

85
00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:15.113
...paid for every lousy buck of it.

86
00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.573
But watch out.

87
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.199
Watch out for the bulls.

88
00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:22.454
Lousy, stinking bulls are everywhere.

89
00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.748
Bulls all over the place.

90
00:10:24.915 --> 00:10:27.000
You just drive down and dig it up.

91
00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.461
Dig it all up.

92
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.548
And then...

93
00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.967
And then you fix yourselves all up.

94
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:37.552
Fix yourselves all up.

95
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.556
Walk down the street like a king,
back to the old neighborhood.

96
00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:44.476
See the fellas, the dames...

97
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.771
...the dames, all with a big hello...

98
00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.399
...a big hello for old Smiler.

99
00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:53.568
Good old Smiler...

100
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:58.031
...everybody's friend.

101
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.743
Everybody's...

102
00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:10.752
- Aunt Belle, I didn't mean to do it!
- Holy mackerel! Take it easy.

103
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.839
Please, say it don't make
any difference, Aunt Belle!

104
00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:17.467
Please, you got to say...

105
00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:21.221
You got to tell me
it don't make any difference!

106
00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:23.890
For heaven's sake, tell him.

107
00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:26.142
It... It don't make any difference.

108
00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.293
That guy's dead.
You'd better believe it.

109
00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:53.545
I believe it, all right.

110
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.881
But if he jumps up again,
I'm getting the hell out of here.

111
00:11:57.049 --> 00:12:00.969
- What a routine he went through.
- Somebody ought to cover him up.

112
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:04.264
What are you looking at?
All I got is this sweater.

113
00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.433
I got a blanket in the truck.

114
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.227
Do you think
there was anything in all that?

115
00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.563
He was just raving. He flipped.

116
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.191
Hey. This must...
This must be the police.

117
00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:17.819
Think we ought to tell them
what he said?

118
00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.822
Don't say anything
or we'll be here all day.

119
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.700
We got to be in Vegas this afternoon.

120
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.827
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma.

121
00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.663
My wife and I are on
our second honeymoon.

122
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:32.917
My wife's up there with her mother.
We're on our way to Lake Mead.

123
00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:36.087
What's to argue about? Just clam up.
Don't say nothing.

124
00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:38.173
This way, we get out of here.

125
00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:42.427
Are you a police officer?

126
00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.436
Yep!

127
00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.694
- How long ago did this happen?
- A few minutes ago.

128
00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:02.197
About five minutes ago.

129
00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:05.366
- Any of you actually see it happen?
- Well, uh...

130
00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:08.703
- He passed me on the curve...
- Did anybody actually see it?

131
00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:11.414
He was passing me
when he sailed right out there.

132
00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:14.375
- Right over there, up there.
- Who was the first down here?

133
00:13:14.543 --> 00:13:17.170
We all went down.

134
00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:19.047
Was he dead?

135
00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.882
Was he already dead?

136
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:25.094
I said, "Was he already dead
when you got down here?"

137
00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:27.472
Practically.

138
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.059
He was still alive.
Did he say anything?

139
00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:37.106
- Did he say anything before he died?
- What about?

140
00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:38.942
What do you mean, "what about?"

141
00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:41.945
Did he say anything
or didn't he say anything?

142
00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:49.536
- He was raving, Officer.
- Raving? What about?

143
00:13:49.703 --> 00:13:53.414
Well, he said...
What he said was sort of...

144
00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:54.916
Embarrassing.

145
00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:57.085
What was? Come on.

146
00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.588
He thought
that this fellow was his aunt.

147
00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:03.383
- His aunt?
- Yeah. His Aunt Belle.

148
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.426
Must have had an aunt
named Aunt Belle.

149
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.095
All right!

150
00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:11.099
Did he make any kind of statement?
Any last messages?

151
00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:14.227
He didn't make that clear at all.

152
00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:16.896
He didn't make anything clear.
Can we get going?

153
00:14:17.064 --> 00:14:18.898
Just a minute.

154
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:21.442
I'll get your names
and where you can be reached.

155
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.153
We're on our honeymoon.
We don't know where we'll be.

156
00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:25.572
We can't stick around.

157
00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:29.701
We're due in Las Vegas.
We don't know how long we'll stay there.

158
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:33.204
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma
before I get back to...

159
00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:35.248
We stopped to see if we could help.

160
00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.458
We was too late. Let us go, okay?

161
00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:40.378
We'll hold services for him later.
We got our lives to live.

162
00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:43.506
- We ain't had breakfast yet.
- All right.

163
00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:45.967
I'll have to get your name, anyway.

164
00:14:47.177 --> 00:14:48.303
Hold it.

165
00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:51.472
Me?

166
00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:55.894
- Why?
- In case the coroner wants a statement.

167
00:14:57.187 --> 00:15:00.481
J. Russell Finch,
2790 Penrose Boulevard, Fresno.

168
00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:04.319
I won't be home for a few weeks
but you can get me through my office.

169
00:15:04.486 --> 00:15:06.988
- What'd you say?
- Where is your office?

170
00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:10.950
Pacific Edible Seaweed Company
and it's in Fresno.

171
00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:13.703
- You can call my secretary.
- Ambulance is on its way.

172
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:14.829
Yeah.

173
00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.539
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

174
00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:20.501
We'd better shift those cars.
They're on the curb.

175
00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:23.004
That's all we can get from this group.

176
00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.964
Thank you, gentlemen.

177
00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:26.341
Thanks.

178
00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:35.391
Well...

179
00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:38.102
There's an unexpected twist for you.

180
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.813
They're not going to like this
down at Santa Rosita.

181
00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:43.858
- Culpeper's going to scream.
- Yeah.

182
00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:47.028
- We better get our story straight if...
- What story?

183
00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:49.614
He woke up as usual.
He started driving his car.

184
00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.240
He stopped for breakfast.

185
00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:53.993
He went to the gents' room,
climbed out the back window.

186
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:57.956
So what? Even Culpeper can't say
we should've been in there with him.

187
00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:01.084
What got me is the way
he went sailing out there.

188
00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:05.463
If I have to climb much more,
I'll be laying there with him.

189
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:06.631
Poor soul.

190
00:16:13.555 --> 00:16:15.264
Uh...

191
00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:18.226
Melville, what happened?

192
00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:21.646
We couldn't do anything for him.
Nothing we could do. Come on.

193
00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.064
Well?

194
00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:27.193
Uh...

195
00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:30.071
- It was a terrible thing.
- Russell, I feel sick.

196
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:31.698
Take it easy. These things happen.

197
00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:34.534
What kind of attitude is that,
"these things happen"?

198
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:37.787
They only happen because this country
is full of people...

199
00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:40.748
...who, when things happen,
just say, "These things happen."

200
00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:44.585
- And that's why they happen!
- Let's try not to get upset.

201
00:16:44.753 --> 00:16:46.087
Come on.

202
00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:48.464
We got to have control
of what happens to us.

203
00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:51.342
If we left it up to you,
we'd never hear the last of it.

204
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.095
You're right.

205
00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:03.104
Do you know what those half-wit
morons up in Sacramento do about it?

206
00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:06.649
They just sit there with their big feet
up on their big desk...

207
00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:11.612
...milking 15 million people of...
- Listen, I want to say something.

208
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.115
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I've got to say something.

209
00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:17.285
- What are you looking at?
- I'm watching something.

210
00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.454
Benjy, turn around, sit still.

211
00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:23.249
- Play it straight.
- They're not kiddin'. They went for it.

212
00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:25.626
Yeah? What are you going to do now?

213
00:17:25.794 --> 00:17:29.380
I want you to tell me everything
that man told you, word for word.

214
00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:30.465
Don't leave out anything.

215
00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:32.508
But do you think he really meant it?

216
00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:38.723
Monica, I don't know about anybody else,
but some of them believed it.

217
00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.934
Like those two back there.
Don't look over there!

218
00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:45.438
I know where it is. It's under a big W.
That's what he said.

219
00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:47.899
Like a windmill or a waterfall
or something.

220
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.777
I hope it's not under a waterfall.

221
00:17:50.944 --> 00:17:53.446
Think of something that starts with a W.

222
00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:56.157
Wealth. Which.

223
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.409
Let's see. Where.

224
00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:00.995
Work. That's it.
I got to work on where it is.

225
00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:05.416
One thing Dr. Carroll said was Russell
was to have no undue excitement...

226
00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:07.168
...for at least two weeks
because of his condition.

227
00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:09.128
- But...
- That's why we came on this trip...

228
00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:12.006
...so Russell could relax.
You should have told the police.

229
00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:14.759
You keep saying that.
What's the police got to do with it?

230
00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:18.096
I think the police were chasing him.
They drove up so fast.

231
00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:21.182
Why shouldn't they've been chasing him?
He was speeding.

232
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.184
I'm only thinking
of Russell's condition.

233
00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:27.855
You mean his financial condition.
That's the only condition he has.

234
00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:31.526
Do you know why your husband
had a nervous breakdown?

235
00:18:31.693 --> 00:18:36.322
It's because he has sunk $40,000,
including $15,000 of my money...

236
00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.909
...into a company that makes
seaweed for people to eat.

237
00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:43.246
Not only does nobody like it,
it costs $4 a can.

238
00:18:43.413 --> 00:18:45.540
- Yeah, but...
- "Yeah, but," what?

239
00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:47.708
Most people like it and I like it.

240
00:18:47.876 --> 00:18:50.086
I'm working hard,
trying to keep the costs down.

241
00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.380
You were working hard
to keep the costs down...

242
00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:55.716
...the day you ran
into the street screaming.

243
00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:59.137
- Mother!
- Emmeline, shut up! And you, too!

244
00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:01.722
Maybe he was playing
a trick on everybody.

245
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.517
Did you think about that?
He might have been a practical joker.

246
00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:07.937
Oh... Monica! Practical!

247
00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:11.732
What kind of man is going to play a
practical joke on complete strangers...

248
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.485
...with every bone in his body broken?

249
00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:17.738
- Watch! Watchtower!
- No.

250
00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:18.948
- Wall...
- No.

251
00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.867
- Walnut tree.
- No, no!

252
00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:22.160
- Walnuts.
- No!

253
00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:23.911
- In bags.
- No!

254
00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:28.291
Why are we doing only 35?
Step on it! See what happens.

255
00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.459
- Mother!
- They'll see what we're doing.

256
00:19:30.627 --> 00:19:32.587
Go ahead and try it.
What've you got to lose?

257
00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:35.089
Mother, he's not that good a driver.

258
00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:46.100
- Uh-huh.
- A-ha!

259
00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:48.477
Going to leave the big boy behind?

260
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.541
What are you doing?
Why are we slowing down?

261
00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:12.960
It's no use.
We can't lose them this way.

262
00:20:13.128 --> 00:20:15.755
The inside of my stomach...

263
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.147
What's that idiot in the truck doing?

264
00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.483
What's he doin' back there?

265
00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:38.486
I bet he's running out of gas. Good!

266
00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:29.453
What happened to you?

267
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:32.456
- Having trouble with your engine?
- Run out of gas?

268
00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:36.877
- What, you bend your tailpipe?
- No. It was just one of my tires.

269
00:21:37.045 --> 00:21:38.671
I thought...

270
00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:41.549
Shucks! Okay, so I was trying to...

271
00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:42.633
Rats.

272
00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:45.261
This whole thing...
I think we're making a big mistake.

273
00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:47.638
- I absolutely agree.
- So?

274
00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:49.890
We're being silly
running around like this.

275
00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:52.476
- Sure. We're getting nowhere.
- By george, he's right.

276
00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:55.730
Let's do something sensible.
Let's just discuss this thing...

277
00:21:55.897 --> 00:21:58.357
...and reason something out.
- I'm with you.

278
00:21:58.525 --> 00:22:01.444
And we can come to some conclusion
like intelligent people.

279
00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:03.404
Let's do that: What he said.

280
00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:06.699
Yeah. That way nobody will have an
advantage on one another, right?

281
00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:08.034
It's fair.

282
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:09.869
We'd better get the cars off that curve.

283
00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:12.913
Let's not talk here, but over there.
There's plenty of room.

284
00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:14.582
Fine, see you over there.

285
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.876
Over there.

286
00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:21.213
You're through to Homicide.

287
00:22:23.383 --> 00:22:25.426
Santa Rosita Police Station...

288
00:22:25.886 --> 00:22:27.178
...Detective Division.

289
00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:30.598
I'm connecting you now.
Santa Rosita Police Station.

290
00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:32.600
Detective Division. Matthews.

291
00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:36.771
No, Sheriff, the Chief isn't here.
He's a little late this morning.

292
00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:39.273
I'll stay late after school. Who is it?

293
00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:41.734
- Sheriff, Crockett County.
- Who?

294
00:22:41.902 --> 00:22:44.612
- That's where the Smiler is.
- I wonder if anything happened.

295
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.365
Gertie, will you put
that call through here?

296
00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:49.575
How about some coffee, Schwartz?

297
00:22:57.751 --> 00:22:59.668
Hello, Sheriff. Culpeper.

298
00:22:59.836 --> 00:23:01.879
What'd he do, make a break?
What happened?

299
00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:03.964
Afraid I got some bad news.

300
00:23:04.132 --> 00:23:07.218
- Grogan's cashed in his chips.
- He what?

301
00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:10.429
He crashed his car
about 20 minutes ago.

302
00:23:10.597 --> 00:23:12.681
He was making a break, all right.

303
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.435
How did it happen?
Where did it happen?

304
00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:22.775
On 39, about 18 miles east
of Danby Junction.

305
00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:27.154
- Nine miles west of Valley Center.
- Were there any witnesses?

306
00:23:27.322 --> 00:23:29.865
A few people went down
to see if they could help.

307
00:23:30.033 --> 00:23:33.160
- Was he killed outright?
- I don't know, but I can find out.

308
00:23:33.328 --> 00:23:35.121
Do that. See what they said.

309
00:23:35.288 --> 00:23:37.164
Thanks very much, Sheriff.

310
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.504
Well...

311
00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:46.507
It's a great way to start the day.

312
00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:49.760
You wait for 15 years
to solve a really important case...

313
00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:51.262
...and just when you...

314
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.768
It's all right, Chief.
I'll get it for you.

315
00:24:01.356 --> 00:24:02.731
He did it again.

316
00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:23.335
Get that fella's number!
Get his number!

317
00:24:23.503 --> 00:24:25.880
Get that fella's number!
Get his number!

318
00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:35.723
Item: One large furniture
van. Item: One red Volkswagen.

319
00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:38.100
That's them. Call in.

320
00:24:38.852 --> 00:24:40.769
2-1-6-2, 2-1-5-8.

321
00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:43.564
We just made all four of them
parked alongside the road.

322
00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:46.233
They're standing there talking. Over.

323
00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:50.488
Sammy, let that ambulance
go. And stay by the radio.

324
00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:55.242
The man said there was a certain amount
of money buried in this park.

325
00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.452
Under a big W.

326
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.162
What is a big W?

327
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.080
We find out, we'll send you a wire.

328
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.044
It's only a possibility
that this man was telling the truth.

329
00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:10.591
If it was the truth, then it is a fact
this place is almost 200 miles away.

330
00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:13.052
I suggest we quietly get
into our cars...

331
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.306
...and drive down there
at a safe, sound speed...

332
00:25:17.474 --> 00:25:19.850
...keeping in sight of each other.

333
00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:23.812
When we get there, we dig up the money,
providing there is money...

334
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.274
...and if we do find it, we share it
amongst us in a simple manner.

335
00:25:27.442 --> 00:25:29.068
He's got a point. He's got something.

336
00:25:29.236 --> 00:25:32.279
- We should go straight to the police.
- The police? Why?

337
00:25:32.447 --> 00:25:36.534
It's all right, she's with us.
What's this "fair shares for everybody"?

338
00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:41.372
We arrived in four vehicles. I think
we should split it up in four quarters.

339
00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:45.167
Four quarters?
What are you talking about? Quarters?

340
00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:48.712
You mean you three each get a quarter
and we have to split a quarter?

341
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.215
- That's right.
- What are you trying to pull?

342
00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:54.385
- Seems fair to me.
- Naturally, it's fair to you.

343
00:25:54.553 --> 00:26:00.266
- It just cheats us, that's all.
- $350,000 divided by four is...

344
00:26:00.433 --> 00:26:03.018
... let's say, $87,500.

345
00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:04.687
That's what it is.

346
00:26:04.854 --> 00:26:08.232
The three of you get $87,500
and Benjy and I have to split.

347
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.694
There was five of us down at the wreck.
We should split it five ways.

348
00:26:11.861 --> 00:26:12.903
He's right. We should.

349
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:15.656
I'm perfectly willing to discuss it
in a five-way manner.

350
00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:18.492
We can discuss it in a five-way manner,
five shares...

351
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.828
...each share would be $70,000...

352
00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:22.621
$70,000?

353
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:23.831
Holy mackerel!

354
00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:28.002
You realize how many loads
I'd have to haul from Modesto to Yuma...

355
00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:29.587
You're overlooking one thing.

356
00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:31.755
- We're overlooking...
- What little thing?

357
00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:34.174
- What little thing?
- We can all count.

358
00:26:34.342 --> 00:26:36.760
- There were eight of us.
- There were eight of us.

359
00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:39.597
Speaking for my wife and myself,
we'd be just as happy...

360
00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:43.309
Happy with two-eighths instead
of a quarter? Awfully big of you.

361
00:26:43.476 --> 00:26:46.395
Wait a minute, hold it.
Put it back the way it was before.

362
00:26:46.563 --> 00:26:48.772
Either one quarter for each car,

363
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.900
including the van,
or one fifth for each guy.

364
00:26:52.068 --> 00:26:56.614
- Because this old bag has to stick...
- How dare you!

365
00:26:56.781 --> 00:27:01.285
Chief, we got a situation here
that is absolutely incredible.

366
00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:04.538
- Look, Smiler Grogan... Remember him?
- Yes.

367
00:27:04.706 --> 00:27:07.374
Smiler Grogan spent the night here, see?

368
00:27:07.542 --> 00:27:09.627
Made his break this morning.

369
00:27:09.794 --> 00:27:14.173
He drove up this way, got to here,
crashed and killed himself.

370
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:17.718
But before he died,
some people stopped to help him.

371
00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:21.013
They are now stopped here, talking.

372
00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:24.224
I think they're arguing about something.

373
00:27:24.392 --> 00:27:28.729
And a Crockett County unit
has got them under observation.

374
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.982
We give shares to everybody
and for everything.

375
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.068
Now, there are eight of us.

376
00:27:34.235 --> 00:27:37.071
There's eight shares for that.
Then there were four vehicles.

377
00:27:37.238 --> 00:27:40.407
If we give four shares for that,
that's 12 shares already.

378
00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:42.743
There were five of us
who went down to the wreck.

379
00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:44.411
We give five shares for that.

380
00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:46.288
That makes it 17, right?

381
00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:48.290
Now, 17 shares and then we add...

382
00:27:48.458 --> 00:27:51.293
...the same number of shares
as people in each vehicle.

383
00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:54.755
Three for your group, two for yours,
two for us, and one for you.

384
00:27:54.923 --> 00:27:57.424
That adds up to 25 shares.

385
00:27:57.592 --> 00:28:02.763
25 into 350,000 is $14,000 per share.

386
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:04.640
Figured like that would mean...

387
00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:08.102
...you'd get three shares for being
three people, one for the car...

388
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:10.854
...one share for going down
and looking at the wreck...

389
00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:13.482
...and three for being
three more people in the car.

390
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:18.570
A total of eight shares,
giving you $112,000.

391
00:28:18.738 --> 00:28:22.157
That should cover everything,
including the emancipation of women.

392
00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:23.450
Let's see now.

393
00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:26.704
I got one share for being one person...

394
00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:30.290
...one share for going down the hill,
one share for the truck...

395
00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:33.127
...one share for being a person
in the truck.

396
00:28:33.294 --> 00:28:38.757
But no matter how you figure it out, I
still don't get as much as anybody else.

397
00:28:38.925 --> 00:28:41.051
Let me explain it once more.

398
00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:46.265
Their group, they, those three of them,
they get $112,000, right?

399
00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:49.685
Those over there, them,
they get $97,000.

400
00:28:49.853 --> 00:28:52.312
We, us, we get $84,000.

401
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.775
And you, by yourself,
you get $56,000...

402
00:28:56.943 --> 00:28:57.818
...alone.

403
00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:00.988
- That's tax-free money.
- What do you mean, tax-free?

404
00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:05.117
If we go down to this park
and we uncover the money...

405
00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:07.995
I'm sure he's not going
to declare anything.

406
00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:09.997
I know he's not going
to declare anything.

407
00:29:10.165 --> 00:29:14.668
- I'm not going to declare...
- What are you talking about, declare it?

408
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:17.421
I mean, it's like non-taxable income.

409
00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.715
It's like a gift.

410
00:29:19.883 --> 00:29:23.218
If we find the money,
we still have to report the taxes.

411
00:29:23.386 --> 00:29:26.180
Otherwise, it's like stealing
from the government.

412
00:29:26.347 --> 00:29:28.515
You explain it to him, please.

413
00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:30.893
Who me?

414
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.813
If we find the money,
there may not be taxes to pay on it...

415
00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:36.523
...because we found it.

416
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:40.611
- What he was trying to say is...
- Everybody has to pay taxes.

417
00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:44.990
Even businessmen that rob,
steal and cheat people every day...

418
00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:46.825
...even they have to pay taxes.

419
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.621
I give up. Anybody got a better,
fairer plan, go ahead.

420
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:54.666
There were eight of us there,
so that simply means eight shares.

421
00:29:54.834 --> 00:29:57.628
- Three for us, two for you...
- This is hopeless.

422
00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:00.881
We'll get no place if we continue
listening to this old bag.

423
00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:04.635
Lady, you trying to split us up
so every man's for himself?

424
00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:06.220
And every woman for himself?

425
00:30:06.387 --> 00:30:08.055
One more funny remark from you...

426
00:30:08.223 --> 00:30:11.225
- Let's get out of here.
- Please, don't argue anymore.

427
00:30:11.392 --> 00:30:14.686
We figured it 17 different ways.

428
00:30:14.854 --> 00:30:17.064
Every time we figured it,
it was no good.

429
00:30:17.232 --> 00:30:20.818
No matter how we figured it,
somebody didn't like it.

430
00:30:20.985 --> 00:30:24.196
Now there's only one way to figure it.

431
00:30:24.364 --> 00:30:26.073
And that is, every man...

432
00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:28.867
...including the old bag, for himself!

433
00:30:29.035 --> 00:30:32.079
- Good luck and may the best man win!
- Right!

434
00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:36.250
Except you, lady.
May you just drop dead!

435
00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:38.585
All right. We all agree on that.

436
00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:43.757
Let's be sensible about this thing.
There's money in this for all of us.

437
00:30:43.925 --> 00:30:47.094
There's enough for you.
There's enough for you...

438
00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:49.805
...for me...

439
00:30:49.973 --> 00:30:52.099
...and for you...

440
00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:53.934
...and there's enough for...

441
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.187
Melville, my shoe!

442
00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:59.106
Get in the car!

443
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:32.222
2-1-5-8, 2-1-6-2, four cars under
observation are passing this checkpoint.

444
00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.224
Lead car is Plymouth station wagon.

445
00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:36.226
Next, the Ford van, the Volkswagen...

446
00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:39.146
...and the Chrysler Imperial
convertible, all doing about 50.

447
00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:41.356
Yep, they're on their way.

448
00:31:41.524 --> 00:31:43.400
All traveling
in the same direction?

449
00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:45.193
Right. According to my boys...

450
00:31:45.361 --> 00:31:48.238
...they're all
on reckless driving charges already.

451
00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:52.993
None of those people must suspect
that anybody's interested in them.

452
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:55.537
Now, Sheriff,
will you get on to Capt. Hardesty...

453
00:31:55.705 --> 00:31:58.123
...and see how many helicopters
he can let us have?

454
00:31:58.291 --> 00:32:01.793
I'll see what we can do
and I'll call you back.

455
00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:06.840
Now, where have I always told you
that the Smiler hid the dough?

456
00:32:07.008 --> 00:32:08.926
- I know.
- Where?

457
00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:12.512
- Right there.
- That's right, yeah.

458
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.515
If these merrymakers
decide to go for it...

459
00:32:15.683 --> 00:32:18.560
...they'll go to the crossroads
and turn south.

460
00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:22.022
But why did Smiler head east
when he made his break...

461
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.358
...if the money is down here somewhere?

462
00:32:24.525 --> 00:32:25.734
Oh!

463
00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:30.197
Aloysius, the guy is just being clever.
You can't...

464
00:32:30.365 --> 00:32:32.449
5 will get you 10...

465
00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:36.536
...they turn south at the crossroads.
- You got yourself a bet.

466
00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:52.886
"Mount Shasta National Forest."
Are we near...

467
00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:55.681
That's on the top!
Look down near the bottom.

468
00:32:57.016 --> 00:33:00.310
- Are we near Oregon?
- That's 700 miles from here.

469
00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:16.284
Don't pass it!

470
00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.210
You'll lose your license.

471
00:33:29.924 --> 00:33:33.135
We've got the Imperial
and we're running last?

472
00:33:33.302 --> 00:33:35.303
I can't pass them on the curves.

473
00:33:35.471 --> 00:33:38.098
Go on. Go ahead. Look, there's a space!

474
00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:41.184
You waiting for an engraved invitation?

475
00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:43.812
Get over!

476
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.939
Get over to the side
where you belong!

477
00:34:40.661 --> 00:34:42.913
I said it before and I'll say it again.

478
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:45.499
I didn't want to move to California.

479
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.804
- Did you find it yet?
- I can't find it anywhere.

480
00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:00.514
Take the wheel. Give me the map.

481
00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:02.557
Take the wheel! Give me the map.

482
00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:05.977
It must be here.
Right over here. Valley Center!

483
00:35:06.145 --> 00:35:07.270
It's right here.

484
00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:09.022
There's an airfield not far...

485
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.858
Get it off your face!

486
00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:16.947
- Get it off me!
- Don't go in there!

487
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:19.366
Swing over! Watch out!

488
00:35:23.996 --> 00:35:25.997
- Take it off.
- Get it off!

489
00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:27.749
I've had enough.

490
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:45.392
- They're going to hire airplanes.
- Never mind. Go!

491
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.854
- But they'll be there hours before...
- I said never mind. Let's go!

492
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:51.148
Nobody's getting me up in the air.

493
00:36:04.078 --> 00:36:07.664
I wanted to be reasonable,
give them reasonable shares.

494
00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:10.417
No. They wanted every man for himself.

495
00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:13.503
I'm going to show them
what kind of man they're dealing with.

496
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.973
It's stalled, Benjy.
We got dust in the carburetor.

497
00:36:31.898 --> 00:36:35.442
When the people who own this see this,
I sure hate to think...

498
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.736
Never mind.

499
00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:38.904
Here's the bike.

500
00:36:39.071 --> 00:36:41.948
Get to the nearest phone
and hire the best car you can find.

501
00:36:42.116 --> 00:36:46.953
But this is a girl's bike.
This is for a little girl.

502
00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:49.915
I've got to get this stuff back
so I can lock up the van.

503
00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:52.834
We'll put everything away.
Will you get going? Hurry.

504
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:55.045
Okay.

505
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.339
I got to admit...

506
00:36:58.799 --> 00:37:00.800
...I feel kind of silly.

507
00:37:00.968 --> 00:37:02.719
You know what I mean?

508
00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:13.855
Will you take us or won't you?

509
00:37:14.023 --> 00:37:16.316
For $250, I guess I will.

510
00:37:16.484 --> 00:37:20.237
You take care of the plane.
We'll leave our car here till tomorrow.

511
00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:22.572
- I'll give you a check.
- Check?

512
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.158
Traveler's check from
the Bank of America. Don't worry.

513
00:37:25.326 --> 00:37:27.744
- Oh, boy.
- Hey!

514
00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:30.372
Are you a pilot?
Is there a plane around?

515
00:37:30.539 --> 00:37:31.539
Right both times.

516
00:37:31.707 --> 00:37:33.792
Where's an airplane? I don't see any.

517
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.835
There's only one. We've chartered it.

518
00:37:36.003 --> 00:37:38.672
- So you and your friend...
- Did you make a deal with them?

519
00:37:38.839 --> 00:37:42.008
- Right.
- Where can we charter another plane?

520
00:37:42.176 --> 00:37:44.886
- Nearest place is North Valley.
- Where's that?

521
00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:48.807
Other side of Valley Center,
about 12 miles, 15 miles.

522
00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:51.893
- Excuse us.
- Filibuster, filibuster.

523
00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:54.145
You can stick around
and watch us take off.

524
00:37:54.313 --> 00:37:56.731
Listen, dentist. I hate dentists.

525
00:37:56.899 --> 00:38:00.819
I hate you so much, I'm not able to tell
you how much in front of your wife.

526
00:38:00.987 --> 00:38:02.737
Vice versa.

527
00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:06.950
Come on over here! Come on!

528
00:38:18.629 --> 00:38:19.796
Good morning.

529
00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:21.965
- Good morning.
- Had an accident?

530
00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:24.926
- Anyone hurt?
- No, but we've got to get to a phone.

531
00:38:25.094 --> 00:38:27.262
Can you give us a lift?

532
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.348
Of course, I should be
absolutely delighted.

533
00:38:31.892 --> 00:38:34.978
Upsy-daisy. I'm afraid you
caught me on the hub there.

534
00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:37.522
Madam, do be careful.
I have some cactus specimens...

535
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.942
- Oh!
- I'm most frightfully sorry.

536
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.904
I've been gathering some samples
of desert flora.

537
00:38:45.072 --> 00:38:46.573
Where shall I put this?

538
00:38:47.908 --> 00:38:49.159
Boy.

539
00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:53.121
Good morning.

540
00:38:53.289 --> 00:38:56.291
It certainly is. We're in a hurry.
We've got to get to a phone.

541
00:38:56.459 --> 00:38:58.501
Of course, with pleasure.

542
00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:01.796
Jolly nasty accident there.
Jolly lucky nobody was hurt.

543
00:39:01.964 --> 00:39:05.300
Where did you get that funny accent?
Are you from Harvard or something?

544
00:39:05.468 --> 00:39:08.136
Harvard? Rather not. I'm English.

545
00:39:08.304 --> 00:39:10.013
Sounds so foreign.

546
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:12.974
Really? I say,
we haven't introduced ourselves.

547
00:39:13.142 --> 00:39:15.602
My name is Algernon Hawthorne...
Col. Hawthorne.

548
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:19.064
- You're a colonel?
- Lieutenant colonel, actually.

549
00:39:19.231 --> 00:39:20.899
My name is Finch. This is my wife.

550
00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:24.110
This is my mother-in-law, Mrs. Marcus.

551
00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:26.821
Do stuff those in the back.

552
00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:29.199
Cactus. It's rather a hobby of mine.

553
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:32.410
Spent the last 10 days
gathering some for my collection.

554
00:39:32.578 --> 00:39:34.704
Nothing spectacular, actually.

555
00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:38.208
Cereus echinocactus, opuntia.
That sort of thing.

556
00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:40.710
Been enjoying a spot of leave
from Vandenberg.

557
00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:43.171
- From what?
- Vandenberg.

558
00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:44.756
The missile place.

559
00:39:44.924 --> 00:39:48.301
I've been attached there
for the last 10 months. Liaison work.

560
00:39:48.469 --> 00:39:51.096
All very hush-hush and whoosh-whoosh.

561
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.140
That sort of thing, you know.

562
00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:58.395
Please, will you look at the road?

563
00:39:59.438 --> 00:40:01.981
Yes. Whoosh-whoosh.

564
00:40:07.154 --> 00:40:09.656
- Don't stop! Keep moving!
- Mother!

565
00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:13.243
That big stupid lout! He ran into us.
Keep moving!

566
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:24.963
I won't fly in this old...
Listen to it.

567
00:40:25.131 --> 00:40:26.923
Look at how it's shuddering.

568
00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:31.052
Can't we go on our second honeymoon
and forget all about this?

569
00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.514
Honey, please, darling.
Believe me, everything is all right.

570
00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:36.891
Do you think I'd take a chance with you

571
00:40:37.059 --> 00:40:38.977
if there was any danger
in flying this thing?

572
00:40:39.145 --> 00:40:41.104
This plane is really built.

573
00:40:42.022 --> 00:40:43.898
When was this plane built?

574
00:40:44.066 --> 00:40:47.110
1916.

575
00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:51.281
1916. These planes are tried and true.

576
00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:54.033
There's nothing experimental
about these planes.

577
00:40:54.201 --> 00:40:57.162
So, come on.
Let's have one big adventure.

578
00:40:57.329 --> 00:40:59.706
Get up there and have some fun.
Here we go.

579
00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:07.213
- That scratched the paint.
- Help!

580
00:41:27.693 --> 00:41:29.360
Haven't you got another car...

581
00:41:29.528 --> 00:41:32.071
What? All right. Thanks.

582
00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:35.742
Are you sure you can't rent us
that truck? I'll pay.

583
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.660
I told you, we can't.

584
00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:40.830
This is our first week open.
How could we do without our truck?

585
00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:42.790
We're in business.

586
00:41:42.958 --> 00:41:46.336
We'll have to speak to the Englishman.
If we tell him what happened...

587
00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:48.046
How can you admit we're involved...

588
00:41:48.214 --> 00:41:52.091
- He'll say he's entitled to a share.
- He would be if he drove us there.

589
00:41:52.259 --> 00:41:55.261
If we don't tell him, he won't.

590
00:41:56.096 --> 00:41:58.223
You're such a genius.

591
00:41:58.766 --> 00:42:00.433
Listen! Only 10 percent!

592
00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:02.977
There's no reason
he should expect any more!

593
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.701
Thanks for stopping.
Can you give me a lift?

594
00:42:19.662 --> 00:42:22.872
What's with the kiddy bicycle?
Are you some kind of a nut?

595
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.251
No. I had an accident.
I got to get to Santa Rosita fast.

596
00:42:26.418 --> 00:42:28.836
Can't help you.
I'm turning off a little way up.

597
00:42:29.004 --> 00:42:31.130
Wait, let me think.

598
00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:34.759
I got to tell somebody.
Could you spare a couple of hours?

599
00:42:34.927 --> 00:42:36.052
Couple of hours?

600
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.514
You've been out in the sun too long.
You're starting to crack up.

601
00:42:39.682 --> 00:42:41.474
Wait a minute. Listen.

602
00:42:41.642 --> 00:42:44.102
Just hear me out.

603
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:48.565
What I'm gonna tell you, you just ain't
going to believe it could've happened.

604
00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:51.234
There was an accident here
a little while back...

605
00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:55.321
...about 20 miles back.
It involved $350,000.

606
00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:57.490
Now, like I say...

607
00:42:57.658 --> 00:43:01.744
...when I tell you this, you just ain't
going to believe it could've happened.

608
00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.164
Try me. I'm pretty gullible.

609
00:43:45.998 --> 00:43:48.958
What bothers me is this big W.

610
00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:53.504
You sure you told me all you know?
You don't know what that guy meant?

611
00:43:53.672 --> 00:43:57.050
No, none of them know.
It's just who gets there first.

612
00:43:57.217 --> 00:43:59.427
What do you say? Is it a deal?

613
00:43:59.595 --> 00:44:02.221
Um... Deal!

614
00:44:04.683 --> 00:44:06.476
Kid, you better get
that bike out of there.

615
00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:09.062
Somebody could trip over it in the dark.

616
00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.646
Fellas, I'm glad you're here.
Look, I need your help.

617
00:45:33.814 --> 00:45:36.149
I had this blowout.
I think a spare's in the back.

618
00:45:36.316 --> 00:45:39.736
It may be a little flat.
Is there an airport anyplace around?

619
00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:42.655
If the spare's flat, don't fix it.
Give me a new tire.

620
00:45:42.823 --> 00:45:44.657
You ain't got a new tire, fix the spare.

621
00:45:44.825 --> 00:45:48.077
But don't look at me, move it.
You could be gassing up.

622
00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:52.290
What is it, a staring contest?
Move, move, will you? Come on!

623
00:45:53.125 --> 00:45:54.876
The pension in my grade...

624
00:45:55.043 --> 00:46:00.631
...has not been upped
one red cent since 1934.

625
00:46:00.799 --> 00:46:02.842
Now... Uh...

626
00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:06.137
If the Mayor
will get behind a resolution...

627
00:46:06.305 --> 00:46:08.848
What can I do?
I can't put any pressure on the Mayor!

628
00:46:09.016 --> 00:46:10.808
You can, Al.

629
00:46:10.976 --> 00:46:12.310
That's the whole point.

630
00:46:12.478 --> 00:46:14.687
This case,
I'll have finished by tonight.

631
00:46:14.855 --> 00:46:18.065
It's one of the biggest cases
we've ever had across our books.

632
00:46:18.233 --> 00:46:20.193
Tell the Mayor about it.

633
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:24.864
Tell him the money is right here,
where I always said it was...

634
00:46:25.032 --> 00:46:26.741
...right in this neighborhood.

635
00:46:26.909 --> 00:46:30.536
Tell him what credit will be reflected
upon the department.

636
00:46:30.704 --> 00:46:35.166
Come on, Aloysius,
get in there and pitch for me.

637
00:46:35.334 --> 00:46:37.460
I can try.

638
00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.879
He'll listen to you.

639
00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:44.550
If he gets behind this,
it'll pass unanimously.

640
00:46:44.718 --> 00:46:46.385
Now, you know...

641
00:46:46.553 --> 00:46:48.596
You know, Al, I got it coming.

642
00:46:48.764 --> 00:46:51.390
I'll do everything I can.

643
00:46:51.558 --> 00:46:53.643
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

644
00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:57.021
There's just one other little thing...

645
00:46:57.189 --> 00:46:59.065
No. Nothing.

646
00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:00.399
Vacation.

647
00:47:00.567 --> 00:47:04.403
Once I get Smiler Grogan out of the way,
my desk is clear.

648
00:47:04.571 --> 00:47:10.034
I'd like to take a three-week vacation.
Take Ginger on a real nice holiday.

649
00:47:10.202 --> 00:47:12.870
- Is that all right with you?
- Of course it's all right.

650
00:47:13.038 --> 00:47:15.706
Thanks. I can hardly wait to tell her.

651
00:47:15.874 --> 00:47:18.709
- You won't forget about the Mayor?
- No.

652
00:47:18.877 --> 00:47:22.421
I'll do my best. I promise you that.

653
00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:25.216
Aloysius,
I'll never forget you for this.

654
00:47:25.384 --> 00:47:28.177
You know something, Al?
I got a feeling this morning...

655
00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:31.430
...that everything's coming my way.

656
00:47:40.148 --> 00:47:41.607
Sylvester!

657
00:47:47.906 --> 00:47:50.616
- Why did you do that?
- Why are you shouting?

658
00:47:50.784 --> 00:47:53.411
- Do you have to scare everybody?
- Are you crazy?

659
00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:54.787
Why didn't I think?

660
00:47:54.955 --> 00:47:56.914
We've been running around like lunatics.

661
00:47:57.082 --> 00:48:00.793
Why didn't I think about Sylvester?
He's sitting there right now.

662
00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:03.880
- He lives on Silver Strand Beach.
- I never thought of that.

663
00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:06.799
- Who on earth is Sylvester?
- My son, Emmeline's brother.

664
00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:08.384
He's a lifeguard there.

665
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:12.054
I'm not entirely certain
that you haven't damaged this machine.

666
00:48:16.935 --> 00:48:20.438
Kid, don't mind polishing.
I got a lot of cars. Don't bother.

667
00:48:20.606 --> 00:48:22.356
You did a good job.

668
00:48:22.524 --> 00:48:24.317
Have a drink on me. Keep the change.

669
00:48:24.484 --> 00:48:26.277
I took care of your buddy.
Let me go now.

670
00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:27.320
You!

671
00:48:27.487 --> 00:48:30.781
No! It's that lunatic
who escaped from the asylum!

672
00:48:30.949 --> 00:48:33.242
Watch him! He's a homicidal maniac!

673
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.494
Get on the phone, yell "Mayday."

674
00:48:35.662 --> 00:48:37.413
Listen to me. I'm a psychiatrist.

675
00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:40.082
This man is insane! I'm not your nurse.

676
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.500
He has a hate complex.

677
00:48:41.668 --> 00:48:43.753
Calm down!

678
00:48:44.296 --> 00:48:47.006
Somebody will stumble
over the bicycle in the dark, huh?

679
00:48:47.174 --> 00:48:51.010
When I finish with you, they'll be
stumbling over you in the dark!

680
00:48:51.178 --> 00:48:52.887
Get on the phone!

681
00:48:56.975 --> 00:48:58.851
Look out!

682
00:48:59.019 --> 00:49:01.520
Look, I was clowning.

683
00:49:01.688 --> 00:49:04.607
Get out of here! Sir, wait a minute.

684
00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.901
You've got this all...
Why don't you stop?

685
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:09.028
I tell you. I'll kill you!

686
00:49:11.198 --> 00:49:13.324
You got this... Wait!

687
00:49:13.492 --> 00:49:15.368
Don't take it so...

688
00:49:15.535 --> 00:49:18.120
Will you stop staring and get out of...

689
00:49:18.872 --> 00:49:20.831
He's out of his head.

690
00:49:20.999 --> 00:49:23.918
- He's crazy!
- Want us to call... Ray!

691
00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.587
It's a brand-new pump!

692
00:49:26.755 --> 00:49:29.882
- Get out of here!
- Stop that!

693
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:32.218
Stop that! He's crazy!

694
00:49:32.386 --> 00:49:34.261
Hey.

695
00:49:34.429 --> 00:49:36.555
Very good. Quick thinking.
I'm proud of you.

696
00:49:36.723 --> 00:49:38.516
Very good. Tie him up.

697
00:49:38.684 --> 00:49:41.519
I'll have some orderlies come by
with a straitjacket.

698
00:49:41.687 --> 00:49:44.397
- Very good. I'm proud of you.
- I never saw anything...

699
00:49:44.564 --> 00:49:46.941
- How many people has he killed?
- There'll be more.

700
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:49.110
Tie him up for the boys
in the white jackets.

701
00:49:49.277 --> 00:49:52.196
I'm proud of you, boys.
You did a real good job.

702
00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:54.740
Look me up. I'm in the book.
Dr. Zillman.

703
00:49:56.243 --> 00:50:00.079
- Sir, we've got to get to Santa Rosita.
- I tell you, this is a club.

704
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:02.373
We don't do charters.
Nobody here can take you.

705
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:06.419
- Whose plane is that?
- That belongs to Mr. Tyler Fitzgerald.

706
00:50:06.586 --> 00:50:08.212
He isn't going anywhere today.

707
00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:12.049
- Is he here? Can we see him?
- Mr. Fitzgerald's in the billiard room.

708
00:50:12.217 --> 00:50:16.262
- He's asleep. Nobody can talk to him.
- Can we ask him a question?

709
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:18.264
No, you can't.

710
00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:20.599
Hello? Wait a minute!

711
00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:28.024
Come on, Benjy.
That must be Mr. Fitzgerald over there!

712
00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:31.861
- You can't disturb Mr. Fitzgerald!
- We just want to talk to him.

713
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:33.946
- Let him rest, please.
- Hello.

714
00:50:34.114 --> 00:50:35.197
- Sh!
- Don't shush me!

715
00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:37.283
We're trying to talk to him.

716
00:50:37.451 --> 00:50:39.368
Wake up, won't you please?

717
00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:42.496
I think he's got a cold.

718
00:50:42.664 --> 00:50:45.624
Mr. Fitzgerald, listen. Please, sir.

719
00:50:46.293 --> 00:50:49.336
We hate to disturb your sleep,
but it's an emergency.

720
00:50:49.504 --> 00:50:51.464
You've no right to crash in here.

721
00:50:54.009 --> 00:50:55.259
That's a head cold.

722
00:50:55.427 --> 00:50:57.928
Mr. Fitzgerald,
you know where Rosita Beach is?

723
00:50:58.096 --> 00:51:01.807
- Only you can get us there.
- It's a matter of life and death.

724
00:51:01.975 --> 00:51:03.726
Right, a matter of life and death.

725
00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:06.645
- It's our grandmother. She's dying.
- Who's dying?

726
00:51:06.813 --> 00:51:09.982
Our grandmother is dying
and she's sent for us.

727
00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:14.487
She's in Rosita Beach.
She's dying and we're up here.

728
00:51:14.654 --> 00:51:17.698
She'd like us with her when she goes.

729
00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:19.825
Otherwise, she won't go.

730
00:51:19.993 --> 00:51:23.329
- She'll go.
- Sir, they forced their way in here.

731
00:51:23.497 --> 00:51:26.290
No, we didn't. Let me introduce myself.

732
00:51:26.458 --> 00:51:28.334
I'm Dingy Bell. This is Benjy Benjamin.

733
00:51:28.502 --> 00:51:31.170
- How do you do?
- Don't start with that!

734
00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:34.673
Sir, we'd like you to help us out
by taking us down...

735
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.345
- What's the matter?
- Wait just a minute.

736
00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:43.891
I can't see!
Something's happened to my eyes.

737
00:51:44.059 --> 00:51:45.559
I can't see!

738
00:51:45.727 --> 00:51:47.311
You can't see? He can't see.

739
00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:51.357
- Must be an eye cold.
- George, I can't see.

740
00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:54.860
- One minute, Mr. Fitzgerald.
- I can't see! George!

741
00:51:55.028 --> 00:51:56.195
George!

742
00:51:59.074 --> 00:52:00.074
Mr. Fitzgerald!

743
00:52:02.035 --> 00:52:04.495
We want to make sure
he doesn't get loose.

744
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.999
I'll kill that dirty rotten bum...

745
00:52:09.167 --> 00:52:12.002
...if I get my hands on him.
What's the matter?

746
00:52:12.712 --> 00:52:14.046
How come I'm tied up like this?

747
00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:16.549
Just sit there.
Everything will be all right.

748
00:52:16.716 --> 00:52:19.218
Yeah. Friends are coming
to take care of you.

749
00:52:19.386 --> 00:52:21.512
What friends?
What are you talking about?

750
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.556
Get this stuff off me. Turn me loose.

751
00:52:23.723 --> 00:52:25.558
Take it easy. You've been sick.

752
00:52:25.725 --> 00:52:29.436
Who's been sick?
And where's that bum with the glasses?

753
00:52:30.021 --> 00:52:32.982
Now just sit still,
because the doctor is going...

754
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:36.986
What doctor? I don't know no doctor.
What are you guys, crazy or something?

755
00:52:37.154 --> 00:52:39.822
I'm warning you.
Get this stuff off me, you understand?

756
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.992
- Get this stuff off me!
- Watch him, Ray, watch him!

757
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.996
I'm warning you!
I'm going to have to hit you again.

758
00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:49.123
Ow!

759
00:52:49.291 --> 00:52:51.584
My arm! You broke my arm!

760
00:53:07.225 --> 00:53:10.769
You keep this up
and I'm going to get sore.

761
00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:20.613
Okay. That's the way you want it,
that's the way you're going to get it.

762
00:53:25.493 --> 00:53:28.162
- I'll kill you!
- Whoo!

763
00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:34.960
- Help! He's ruining our place!
- Come on, Ray!

764
00:53:45.639 --> 00:53:48.557
- You better get out of here, mister!
- Leave us alone!

765
00:53:54.314 --> 00:53:57.149
- Uh-huh. There you are.
- What are we going to do?

766
00:53:59.402 --> 00:54:02.488
Dr. Zillman! Dr. Zillman!

767
00:54:13.959 --> 00:54:18.879
Help! Put me down!
Put me down immediately!

768
00:54:22.634 --> 00:54:26.512
- That's the way you want it?
- Help! Help!

769
00:54:34.187 --> 00:54:36.146
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

770
00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.697
You're getting out of line. I'm not
kidding. I've had all I can take.

771
00:54:44.864 --> 00:54:47.533
Irwin, we'll have to kill him.

772
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:49.034
- Ready?
- Ready.

773
00:54:49.202 --> 00:54:50.369
- Set?
- Set.

774
00:54:50.537 --> 00:54:51.495
Charge!

775
00:54:58.545 --> 00:55:01.130
He's going nuts! He's really nuts!

776
00:55:02.048 --> 00:55:05.175
- Go away!
- You'd better get out of here!

777
00:55:06.052 --> 00:55:08.053
I mean it, I don't want to...

778
00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:13.684
What'll we do?

779
00:55:14.436 --> 00:55:17.104
Go away!

780
00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:13.118

Whoo!

793
00:56:55.703 --> 00:56:56.620
He's got to be home.

794
00:56:56.788 --> 00:56:59.957
He never gets up this early.
Why doesn't he answer?

795
00:57:04.129 --> 00:57:06.839
I hope you won't mind my asking,
but what sort of chap...

796
00:57:07.006 --> 00:57:08.674
...is this brother-in-law of yours?

797
00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:10.509
He's a nut. Why?

798
00:57:10.677 --> 00:57:13.720
I hope he's nothing like
my brother-in-law. Peculiar chap.

799
00:57:13.888 --> 00:57:15.848
Secretary of a golf club
out near Pangbourne.

800
00:57:16.015 --> 00:57:17.224
So what about him?

801
00:57:17.392 --> 00:57:20.853
I was thinking that if Reggie,
my brother-in-law...

802
00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.356
If Reggie got hold of information
like this information...

803
00:57:24.524 --> 00:57:26.900
...it's likely that would be
the last time...

804
00:57:27.068 --> 00:57:30.696
...anyone would ever see or hear
of dear old Reggie.

805
00:57:30.864 --> 00:57:36.368
I doubt very much whether old Reggie
will be waiting for us in Santa Rosita.

806
00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.996
Cheers.

807
00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:46.545
Tyler! Tyler's probably
still in the shower.

808
00:57:46.713 --> 00:57:50.466
Tyler! There he is! Tyler!

809
00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:52.885
- Tyler!
- You promised!

810
00:57:53.052 --> 00:57:55.888
Hey! I'll wake him up. Tyler!

811
00:57:56.055 --> 00:57:58.682
- Tyler!
- Huh? Huh?!

812
00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:02.811
Wake up! Come on now!

813
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.230
- Get out of here!
- Wait!

814
00:58:05.398 --> 00:58:06.857
Ah!

815
00:58:07.025 --> 00:58:08.400
Mr. Fitzgerald!

816
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:16.909
You think I'll sit still
while some un-American foreigner...

817
00:58:17.076 --> 00:58:19.870
...makes accusations about
my own flesh and blood?

818
00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:22.164
We'll see about that. Stop this car!

819
00:58:23.583 --> 00:58:26.001
- Really, madam.
- Mother, this is awful!

820
00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:28.587
- So we'll see!
- Mother, what are you doing?

821
00:58:28.755 --> 00:58:31.590
You don't trust your brother-in-law?
Let me tell you something.

822
00:58:31.758 --> 00:58:34.426
If my boy is out, then everybody is out.
So we'll see.

823
00:58:34.594 --> 00:58:37.596
We don't even own the car
and you have no right to do what you do.

824
00:58:37.764 --> 00:58:42.726
Rights? You talk to me about rights?

825
00:58:42.894 --> 00:58:43.936
Mother...

826
00:58:44.103 --> 00:58:46.813
You address me on the subject of rights?

827
00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:52.277
Trouble? Having any trouble?

828
00:58:52.445 --> 00:58:55.739
Yes! And we don't need
any help from you.

829
00:59:01.788 --> 00:59:03.372
Well!

830
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:04.998
- Mother, please.
- Ah!

831
00:59:05.166 --> 00:59:06.750
With all due respect, this is too much.

832
00:59:06.918 --> 00:59:09.336
Give Mr. Hawthorne the keys
or we'll never get there.

833
00:59:09.504 --> 00:59:10.420
Too bad.

834
00:59:10.588 --> 00:59:14.550
Madam, I must say I find your attitude
somewhat less than helpful.

835
00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:18.428
And what's all this got to do with you,
if you don't mind telling me?

836
00:59:18.596 --> 00:59:22.140
If we have quite decided
to withdraw from this affair...

837
00:59:22.308 --> 00:59:26.979
...you might be expected to hand me back
my keys so that I could press on.

838
00:59:27.146 --> 00:59:31.358
You keep out of this!
Are we calling Sylvester or not?

839
00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:34.069
No!

840
00:59:34.988 --> 00:59:38.323
We are not. And I'll tell you why.
Because your son, Sylvester...

841
00:59:38.491 --> 00:59:42.661
...is an irresponsible, unreliable,
big loudmouth, no-good bum...

842
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:44.997
...who, if he isn't a crook,
it's only because...

843
00:59:45.164 --> 00:59:48.125
...he hasn't got the brains or ambition
even to become a crook.

844
00:59:48.293 --> 00:59:49.293
Good show!

845
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:53.005
If you want to come, you can.
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

846
00:59:53.172 --> 00:59:56.967
But you've got to give us those keys or
you'll force us to take them from you!

847
00:59:57.135 --> 00:59:58.468
Here, here.

848
01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:08.312
Give us those keys.
Give us those keys.

849
01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:10.480
I don't care where you have them.
I'll get them.

850
01:00:10.648 --> 01:00:13.025
- How dare you.
- Give us those keys.

851
01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:16.403
- You take one more step towards me...
- I'll take another step.

852
01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:19.865
I'm warning you.
You're gonna be sorry!

853
01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:22.868
- Give me the keys.
- You're gonna get it, but good!

854
01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:24.953
- Ah!
- Oof!

855
01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:28.206
- Emmeline!
- Emmeline, stay in the car!

856
01:00:29.208 --> 01:00:30.751
Grab her!

857
01:00:33.504 --> 01:00:36.089
Russell, don't! Mother!

858
01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:39.217
- Put me down!
- Must be stuck.

859
01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:42.638
Russell, you wouldn't.
You couldn't! You shouldn't!

860
01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:45.390
Let me go! Let me get out of here!

861
01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:48.810
I got 'em! Here they are.

862
01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:53.482
We really didn't want to do it.
But that was the only way. Upsy-daisy.

863
01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:57.235
Don't hit him. Ow!

864
01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.741
Madam, please! Please!

865
01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:04.618
You forced us. You forced us.

866
01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:07.037
I'm willing to say I'm sorry,
but you forced us.

867
01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:11.041
- Do us a favor and get back in the car.
- Get away from me! Don't you touch me!

868
01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:14.086
- We had to do it. You saw it, honey.
- Russell, let me go.

869
01:01:14.253 --> 01:01:16.672
Just wait.
You can't manhandle a decent woman.

870
01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:19.341
You're going to jail!
You'll be arrested for assault.

871
01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:23.261
I'm going to sue for everything you've
got. Take your hands off my daughter!

872
01:01:23.429 --> 01:01:25.847
I say, if we are going,
we really must get cracking.

873
01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.182
Russell, how could you?

874
01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.059
- You know we had to...
- Mr. Finch!

875
01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:33.271
Please don't go. We'll be right
with you. See, she made us do it.

876
01:01:33.439 --> 01:01:35.565
Let's forget the whole thing
and be reasonable.

877
01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:38.652
- Please get back in the car.
- Not me!

878
01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.738
We are wasting so much time.
Give me the keys.

879
01:01:58.589 --> 01:02:00.549
The cars are going faster than we are.

880
01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.759
Can't you make this thing
go a little faster?

881
01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:06.972
Wide open, I can.
But wide open eats up a lot of gas.

882
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.808
Then open up wide. I'll pay for the gas.

883
01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:13.562
- It'll cost you about $50.
- Okay, I'll pay when we land.

884
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.856
- Now!
- I got to pay now?

885
01:02:16.023 --> 01:02:19.067
- Now!
- All right, I'll pay you now.

886
01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.569
- Melville...
- What?

887
01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.696
A bug! Get him off!

888
01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:26.491
Get him off! There he is! Get him!

889
01:02:26.659 --> 01:02:29.703
- You're breaking up the airplane!
- Is it down there?

890
01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:33.457
Now you're breaking the floor!

891
01:02:33.624 --> 01:02:35.333
- Help!
- Melville!

892
01:02:35.501 --> 01:02:38.754
None of these 10 people
have any record at all.

893
01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.673
And we're ready to book 'em
for withholding information...

894
01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:44.676
...causing accidents,
failing to report accidents...

895
01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:48.597
...reckless driving, theft, at least
three cases of assault and battery...

896
01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.640
- Capt. Culpeper?
- Yeah.

897
01:02:50.808 --> 01:02:52.726
- That my home?
- Yes, sir.

898
01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:55.812
Uh, Sheriff, excuse me. Another call.

899
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.274
Take the Sheriff. I'll take it in here.

900
01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.985
Freddy, transfer Mrs. Culpeper
to Culpeper's office.

901
01:03:05.364 --> 01:03:08.575
- Hello, Ginger?
- Daddy, it's Billie Sue.

902
01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:11.703
Oh. Let me speak with
your mother, sweetheart.

903
01:03:14.582 --> 01:03:16.082
Well?

904
01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:18.460
Ah, dear.

905
01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:22.172
Tell me something, Ginger.
How does it feel being married...

906
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:26.092
...to the most brilliant personality
in the law enforcement industry?

907
01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.637
Are you referring to yourself?

908
01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:32.974
Ginger, I want you to prepare yourself
for a little shock.

909
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.227
When I tell you what has happened...

910
01:03:35.394 --> 01:03:38.230
So tell me.
I've got this biscuit dough...

911
01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:41.817
The Smiler Grogan case is solved.

912
01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:43.568
The what?

913
01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:47.989
What the hell is the Smiler Grogan case?

914
01:03:50.618 --> 01:03:52.953
The tuna factory robbery.

915
01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.748
The case I've been talking about
for the last 15 years.

916
01:03:57.708 --> 01:04:01.378
All I want you to do
is make all the preparations...

917
01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:04.506
...for a little flight to Hawaii,
Sunday morning.

918
01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:07.425
- So what's the gag?
- It is no gag.

919
01:04:07.593 --> 01:04:10.929
Are you serious
about flying to Hawaii?

920
01:04:12.598 --> 01:04:15.225
Flight 7, Sunday morning.

921
01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:17.936
- Are we taking Billie Sue?
- No!

922
01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:21.189
Just the two of us
for about three weeks.

923
01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:23.567
Now, we're going to celebrate, Ginger.

924
01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:27.237
My feeling is that after 27 years...

925
01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:30.240
...we've earned it.

926
01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:47.883
What's the matter?

927
01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:50.218
- I need help. Can you give me a lift?
- What?

928
01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:53.263
My wife is sick.
The doc sent me out for some medicine.

929
01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:54.347
All right. Come on.

930
01:04:54.515 --> 01:04:56.474
- I just ran out of gas.
- Get in!

931
01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:12.949
- You?
- You?

932
01:05:13.117 --> 01:05:14.659
Wait a minute. We're in trouble.

933
01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:17.162
Everybody's in trouble.
Get out of the way.

934
01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.664
You think we wanted
to leave you back there?

935
01:05:19.832 --> 01:05:21.166
It was my son-in-law
and that Englishman.

936
01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:23.668
What Englishman? Get out of the way.

937
01:05:23.836 --> 01:05:27.547
You leave us here,
and you know what you're going to get?

938
01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:29.799
Nothing! We'll get it all.

939
01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:30.926
How will you do that?

940
01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:33.970
I'll call my son. He lives
about 10 miles from Rosita Beach.

941
01:05:34.138 --> 01:05:38.350
He'll drive there and get the money
and we're going to have it. That's how!

942
01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:41.811
I was going to offer you a share
for taking us to a phone.

943
01:05:41.979 --> 01:05:45.607
But because you're not interested,
we'll wait for another car.

944
01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.400
We're making a terrible mistake.

945
01:05:47.568 --> 01:05:49.444
We should go back
and get my mother-in-law.

946
01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:50.904
- Go back?
- Yes.

947
01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:52.238
You couldn't be serious.

948
01:05:52.406 --> 01:05:56.284
All she has to do is get to a telephone,
my brother-in-law will get there first.

949
01:05:56.452 --> 01:06:00.538
They'll get all and we won't get a dime.
You can believe that.

950
01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:05.377
But look here.

951
01:06:05.544 --> 01:06:08.755
Even if she does get all the money,
this won't make any difference...

952
01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:11.925
...to our agreement.
She wouldn't break her word.

953
01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:16.805
I mean to say, I'd still be entitled
to 10 percent as agreed. Surely.

954
01:06:17.598 --> 01:06:20.517
Surely. Come on, let's go.

955
01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:46.668
- Operator.
- Santa Rosita 7-1-9-6-5.

956
01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:50.755
...and then that dirty, rotten,
slimy bum that double-crossed me.

957
01:06:50.923 --> 01:06:54.009
When I get a hold of that smart aleck,
what I'm going to do...

958
01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:56.928
If you're there, I hope you turn away...

959
01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:59.764
...that's all,
that you just look the other way.

960
01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:04.269
Did you get him?

961
01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.771
Maybe he went out
for the papers or something.

962
01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:08.898
We can keep on trying.

963
01:07:09.066 --> 01:07:13.403
Just supposing we never do get him?
We might be the last ones there.

964
01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:30.295
Just a minute. Down there?

965
01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:32.047
You're kidding. It's too steep.

966
01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:34.883
I drive my jeep down here every day.
Let's go!

967
01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.342
Yeah, let's go. Let's...

968
01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:57.739
You can turn around here.
I sure appreciate this, mister. Thanks.

969
01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.158
Yeah, swell, yeah.

970
01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:04.913
Hi, Eddie.

971
01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:00.844
I got to get out of here.

972
01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:04.389
Will you ask your father to show me?
There must be some other way out!

973
01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.474
Come on! Hurry up!

974
01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:15.817
I could show you a way out.
There's another way to the road.

975
01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:20.113
You know another way to the road?
Good. Come on in. Don't stand there.

976
01:09:20.281 --> 01:09:23.449
If you show me the way out,
I'll give you $1.

977
01:09:23.617 --> 01:09:25.743
- Hm... $3.
- $3? Why, you...

978
01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:27.829
Yeah, all right. I'll give you $3.

979
01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:32.542
But don't stand there, hop in the car.
Hurry kid, I got to get out of here!

980
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.433
- They're not here.
- Probably got a lift.

981
01:09:48.601 --> 01:09:51.352
We only passed six or seven cars
and they weren't in them.

982
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.396
Somebody must have
taken them the other way.

983
01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:56.065
I think we better go back
to that place we phoned from.

984
01:09:56.233 --> 01:09:58.276
What? That's miles
in the wrong direction.

985
01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:00.445
Besides, we can't be certain
they'll be there.

986
01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:03.698
I don't know, I must find my wife.
And I don't know what to do.

987
01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.283
Wherever they are...

988
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:08.786
...surely the most sensible thing
is for the two of us to press on.

989
01:10:08.954 --> 01:10:12.081
For all we know, your brother-in-law
may be out or away somewhere.

990
01:10:12.249 --> 01:10:16.044
Even if he were the first there,
he still has to find the money.

991
01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:19.047
I earnestly recommend
we forget your good ladies...

992
01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.090
...and press on
with all possible dispatch.

993
01:10:21.258 --> 01:10:23.968
All right. We'll press on
with all possible dispatch.

994
01:10:24.136 --> 01:10:26.804
And I don't really think
that personal rancor...

995
01:10:26.972 --> 01:10:30.391
...is going to help the situation,
if I may say so.

996
01:10:46.617 --> 01:10:50.036
Okay, come on, honey.
Let's go. We're here.

997
01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:54.666
We got here first. Let's go.
Come on. I got you.

998
01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:56.000
Atta boy, baby.

999
01:10:56.168 --> 01:10:58.169
We made it. We're here first.

1000
01:10:58.337 --> 01:11:00.463
Take care of my car
until we get back, right?

1001
01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:04.759
Come on, let's go.
Will you go? Come on!

1002
01:11:11.183 --> 01:11:12.600
Over there?

1003
01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.519
There?

1004
01:11:15.312 --> 01:11:16.854
Down there?

1005
01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.264
That'll be $2.90.

1006
01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:55.393
$2.90? Here's $3.00.
Keep the change, but wait for us, okay?

1007
01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:56.894
Oh, sure.

1008
01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:59.897
Wise guy. Come on, let's go.

1009
01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:03.526
- No, we're closed. It's 12:00.
- It's 12:00. They're closed.

1010
01:12:03.694 --> 01:12:07.947
Wait a minute!
All we want is a pick and a shovel!

1011
01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:09.574
Mr. Dinkler's inside.

1012
01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:12.660
Dinkler. That's it.
We'll get Dinkler. Come on.

1013
01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:15.580
Ah!

1014
01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:17.206
Downstairs. Come on.

1015
01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:20.043
They must be here someplace.
Down here, yeah.

1016
01:12:22.254 --> 01:12:24.130
Look for a pick and a shovel, all right?

1017
01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:27.133
Pick and a shovel,
must be someplace around.

1018
01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:28.926
That's all I need.

1019
01:12:29.094 --> 01:12:32.638
That's all I need, boy.
That's all I need, a pick and a shovel.

1020
01:12:32.806 --> 01:12:33.890
I found it!

1021
01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:42.565
Got it!

1022
01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:44.567
- But there...
- I got it! I found it!

1023
01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:52.367
I've no wish to quarrel with you,
but speaking as a representative...

1024
01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:55.912
...of Her Majesty's Armed Forces,
I take the most particular exception...

1025
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.790
You want me to tell you something?
As far as I'm concerned...

1026
01:12:58.957 --> 01:13:01.125
...the whole British race
is practically finished.

1027
01:13:01.293 --> 01:13:04.170
If we hadn't kept
your whole country afloat...

1028
01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:07.298
...by giving you billions
you never even said thank you for...

1029
01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:11.386
...the whole phony outfit would be
sunk under the Atlantic years ago.

1030
01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:12.970
Hey.

1031
01:13:13.138 --> 01:13:15.973
- What are you stopping for?
- Get out of this machine.

1032
01:13:16.141 --> 01:13:17.725
Get out? You're crazy!

1033
01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:20.311
It's my machine.
I'll do as I bloody well please. Out!

1034
01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:23.773
I'm awfully sorry.
I've been very edgy today.

1035
01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:27.151
If I said anything about England,
I apologize.

1036
01:13:27.319 --> 01:13:29.195
I'm glad to hear you say so.

1037
01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:31.239
I must say, if I had the misfortune

1038
01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:33.491
to be a citizen
of this benighted country...

1039
01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:37.662
...I should be most hesitant
in offering any criticism of any other.

1040
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:39.705
Wait a minute.
Are you knocking this country?

1041
01:13:39.873 --> 01:13:41.999
Are you saying something
against America?

1042
01:13:42.167 --> 01:13:43.084
Against it?

1043
01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:46.587
I'd be astounded to hear
anything said for it.

1044
01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:49.549
The whole bloody place
is the most unspeakable matriarchy...

1045
01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:51.175
...in the history of civilization.

1046
01:13:51.343 --> 01:13:55.179
Look at yourself, the way your wife
and her strumpet of a mother...

1047
01:13:55.347 --> 01:13:56.764
...push you through the hoop.

1048
01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:59.851
As far as I can see, American men
have been totally emasculated.

1049
01:14:00.018 --> 01:14:01.102
They're like slaves.

1050
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.479
They die like flies
from coronary thrombosis...

1051
01:14:03.647 --> 01:14:06.607
...while their women sit under
hair dryers eating chocolates...

1052
01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:10.987
...and arranging for every second
Tuesday to be some sort of Mother's Day.

1053
01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:14.991
And this positively infantile
preoccupation with bosoms.

1054
01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:17.160
In all my time
in this wretched country...

1055
01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:21.706
...the one thing that has appalled me
most is this preoccupation with bosoms.

1056
01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:25.084
They've become the dominant theme
in American culture:

1057
01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:28.379
In literature, in advertising,
in entertainment, in everything.

1058
01:14:28.547 --> 01:14:30.298
I'll wager you anything you like...

1059
01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:32.884
...if American women
stopped wearing brassieres...

1060
01:14:33.051 --> 01:14:36.637
...your whole national economy
would collapse overnight.

1061
01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.974
F-7 to Central.
The Crumps are locked...

1062
01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:43.060
...in the hardware store basement.
Shall I let them out? Over.

1063
01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:45.813
How could they get locked in a basement?

1064
01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:48.983
- We better let them out.
- That ain't fair.

1065
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:52.778
- It ain't fair? What ain't fair?
- They got themselves in there.

1066
01:14:52.946 --> 01:14:54.739
They ought to be able
to get themselves out.

1067
01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:59.452
Uh, after all, if you help them,
you're not being fair to the others.

1068
01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.413
But the moment anybody
gets to where they're going...

1069
01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:03.581
...we'll pick them up.

1070
01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.917
What difference does it make
who gets there first?

1071
01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:07.376
It's a race, ain't it?

1072
01:15:07.544 --> 01:15:09.128
Why do you want to help that dentist?

1073
01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:13.508
Me? I've been pulling for that guy Pike
with the furniture van.

1074
01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:15.593
The rules should be the same
for everybody.

1075
01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:17.595
Otherwise, it just ain't fair.

1076
01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:27.688
Central to F-7.

1077
01:15:28.565 --> 01:15:31.943
No. We'll leave them where they are.
See what happens.

1078
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:35.613
Watch all the exits,
but render no assistance. Over.

1079
01:15:39.451 --> 01:15:40.868
Are you happy?

1080
01:16:04.184 --> 01:16:05.393
I need a drink.

1081
01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:08.896
There's some ice and stuff back there.
Make us all some Old Fashioneds.

1082
01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:11.232
You think you ought to drink
while you're flying?

1083
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.401
Stop kidding and make us some drinks.

1084
01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:16.654
Just press the button back there
marked "booze."

1085
01:16:17.781 --> 01:16:20.449
It's the only way to fly.

1086
01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:38.134
Estimated speed 175.

1087
01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:40.344
We'll never be able to keep up with him.

1088
01:16:40.512 --> 01:16:43.764
Better have some of the other units
intercept. Over.

1089
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:47.476
Hello, Ginger?
What's the matter now?

1090
01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:50.896
It's Billie Sue.
Her new boyfriend Oscar...

1091
01:16:51.064 --> 01:16:54.400
...was supposed to come down
from Pomona just to meet us.

1092
01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:57.236
So now she told him
we were going away.

1093
01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:58.821
What? What's the matter?

1094
01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:02.575
You keep forgetting.
If a girl is 6 feet 5 inches tall...

1095
01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:04.869
...she's bound to have special problems.

1096
01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:06.912
- But, Ginger...
- They had some argument...

1097
01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:07.997
Get out!

1098
01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:10.958
... screaming at each other.
Now the whole engagement's off...

1099
01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.918
...and she says she's leaving.

1100
01:17:13.086 --> 01:17:15.504
Leaving what? Leaving home?

1101
01:17:15.672 --> 01:17:17.673
Let me talk to her.
Get her to the phone.

1102
01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:20.426
I'll try. Just a minute.
Talk to your father.

1103
01:17:20.594 --> 01:17:23.346
I won't.
I don't want to talk to him ever.

1104
01:17:23.513 --> 01:17:27.391
Don't be ridiculous.
Whatever else he is, he is your father.

1105
01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:54.168
Ah!

1106
01:17:55.295 --> 01:17:56.587
Ah!

1107
01:18:19.611 --> 01:18:23.280
Ooh! Yeah! Ah!

1108
01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:28.869
Oh!

1109
01:18:31.623 --> 01:18:33.666
You hear bells, baby?

1110
01:18:38.338 --> 01:18:39.255
Yes?

1111
01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:42.425
- Who is that?
- Who's that?

1112
01:18:42.592 --> 01:18:44.218
I want my son! Hey!

1113
01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:50.474
Who is that?
I want to speak to Sylvester Marcus.

1114
01:18:50.642 --> 01:18:53.561
- Sylvester?
- Yeah, baby?

1115
01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:56.689
It's your mom.

1116
01:18:56.857 --> 01:19:01.318
Ah! Good old Mom. Hello!

1117
01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:03.946
- Sylvester?
- Is that you, Mom?

1118
01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:06.741
Of course it's me.
I've been trying you all morning.

1119
01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:09.493
I've been a little busy.

1120
01:19:09.661 --> 01:19:12.329
I've been working
and I didn't hear the phone.

1121
01:19:12.497 --> 01:19:14.457
Hold on a minute, will you, Mom?

1122
01:19:14.624 --> 01:19:18.252
Baby, how about a beer or something?
Man, I feel like...

1123
01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.629
Will you listen?
Something's happened.

1124
01:19:20.797 --> 01:19:24.091
There was an accident this
morning. A man got killed!

1125
01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:25.342
Who got killed?

1126
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:27.178
- Now, listen!
- You all right?

1127
01:19:27.345 --> 01:19:28.804
- Pay attention!
- Sis all right?

1128
01:19:28.972 --> 01:19:30.598
- Will you listen?
- What's wrong?

1129
01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.183
Can you hear me?

1130
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:34.101
There's a whole fortune in cash.

1131
01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:37.605
You can get it before anybody else,
but you've got to hurry!

1132
01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:40.858
What's the matter? What's going on
there? Are you all right?

1133
01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:43.694
Of course I'm all right. Sylvester!

1134
01:19:43.862 --> 01:19:45.112
Are Russell and Emmeline with you?

1135
01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.283
Forget about Russell.
Will you shut up and let me talk?

1136
01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:51.827
What's going on? Where's Russell?

1137
01:19:51.995 --> 01:19:53.996
Don't even mention Russell!

1138
01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:57.500
- When I tell you what Russell did...
- Just tell him about the dough.

1139
01:19:57.667 --> 01:19:59.001
Keep out of this! Shut up!

1140
01:19:59.169 --> 01:20:01.712
- Don't talk. Just listen.
- What did Russell do?

1141
01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.508
He assaulted me, if you wanna know!
He grabbed me beside the road.

1142
01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:08.052
He and this Englishman
I don't even know!

1143
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.554
Who's with you and where are you?

1144
01:20:10.722 --> 01:20:14.683
I'm with this truck driver
in Peterson's Garage in Plaster City.

1145
01:20:14.851 --> 01:20:17.186
Will you shut up a minute
so I can tell you what happened?

1146
01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:21.857
Listen to me close! Stay there,
'cause I'm coming to get you right now.

1147
01:20:22.025 --> 01:20:22.983
Shut up and listen!

1148
01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:26.862
Everything's going to be all right.
Your baby's coming to get you.

1149
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:29.240
- Sit there. Relax. Take it easy.
- Sylvester!

1150
01:20:29.407 --> 01:20:32.326
I'm coming.
Everything's going to be all right.

1151
01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:37.581
Well?

1152
01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:42.628
So he's coming here,
and I'm not to worry about a thing.

1153
01:20:42.796 --> 01:20:45.840
Because everything
is going to be all right.

1154
01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:50.719
Exactly like your father:
A big, stupid, muscle-headed moron!

1155
01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:53.681
The burglar alarm.

1156
01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:57.685
We just throw it on, people hear it,
they come, and we're out.

1157
01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:00.229
Don't be frightened
if it makes a big bell noise.

1158
01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:02.606
Okay? All right? Here we go.

1159
01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:10.948
- I don't hear anything.
- Neither do I. There's no bell.

1160
01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:17.663
Look at it. It just stands there.

1161
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:20.124
Wait a minute.

1162
01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:23.836
Stand back.

1163
01:21:38.476 --> 01:21:41.020
Burglar alarm!

1164
01:21:41.187 --> 01:21:43.314
The stupidest burglar in the world
could come in...

1165
01:21:43.481 --> 01:21:46.233
...and walk away with everything,
and we can't even get out.

1166
01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:49.153
Sheesh!

1167
01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:51.155
Come here!

1168
01:21:58.955 --> 01:22:01.832
Melville? Melville!

1169
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.836
Even if you do get the bell to ring
and somebody comes...

1170
01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:07.922
...what about the damage?

1171
01:22:09.716 --> 01:22:12.343
They're the ones who locked us in!

1172
01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:16.513
This thing has got to work.

1173
01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:23.187
No!

1174
01:22:24.147 --> 01:22:28.025
Please, help me! I'm frying!
Ah! Please! Help me!

1175
01:22:41.247 --> 01:22:43.707
Uh... Don't make them
so sweet this time.

1176
01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:46.919
You've had two already.
Can't you wait till we're on the ground?

1177
01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:49.672
What are you talking about?
I'll make the next batch.

1178
01:22:49.839 --> 01:22:51.215
You take the controls.

1179
01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:54.969
- I don't know how to fly an airplane.
- There's really nothing to it.

1180
01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:59.431
- But Benjy can't fly!
- Nonsense. Anybody can fly a plane.

1181
01:22:59.599 --> 01:23:02.893
I'll check you out.
Put your little hands on the wheel.

1182
01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:05.771
That's it. Now you have it.
Now the feet on the rudder.

1183
01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:07.856
There you are, feet on the rudder.

1184
01:23:08.024 --> 01:23:11.235
Who says this boy can't fly a plane?
There you go.

1185
01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:13.862
I'm making an Old Fashioned
the old-fashioned way...

1186
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:16.073
...the way dear old Dad used to.

1187
01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:17.783
What if something happens?

1188
01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:21.036
What can happen
to an Old Fashioned, all right?

1189
01:23:23.206 --> 01:23:26.458
I know you don't know what to do,
so don't do nothing.

1190
01:23:26.626 --> 01:23:30.754
- I won't do nothing.
- That boy's a natural-born flyer.

1191
01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:44.768
Wait a minute. Benjy! Benjy!
Ease back on her!

1192
01:23:44.936 --> 01:23:46.729
- I'm easing.
- Ease back a little!

1193
01:23:46.896 --> 01:23:50.315
- I'm trying my best.
- All kidding aside...

1194
01:23:50.483 --> 01:23:53.235
I'm not kidding any longer.
It's making me...

1195
01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:56.864
...nervous!
Hey! We've got an accident back here!

1196
01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.615
- What happened?
- I don't know!

1197
01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.248
Oh!

1198
01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:09.001
It's good that truck pulled over.
I can't stand this anymore.

1199
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:11.211
In the name of reason,
pull yourself together.

1200
01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.880
You were 10 feet over the line.

1201
01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:52.711
Uh!

1202
01:24:52.879 --> 01:24:56.215
Oh! So it's fisticuffs you want, is it?
Right. Stick them up!

1203
01:24:56.382 --> 01:24:58.509
- No! No!
- Come here, you coward!

1204
01:24:58.676 --> 01:25:00.552
No! Don't hit me!

1205
01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.596
- Stop, you!
- Don't hit me!

1206
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:10.062
- Blood.
- It certainly is.

1207
01:25:11.898 --> 01:25:13.982
Come back here, you blimey...

1208
01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:21.240
You want to play dirty, huh? Okay!

1209
01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:26.203
Foul! Foul!

1210
01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:27.329
You're not much good...

1211
01:25:27.497 --> 01:25:29.790
...without that horrible
mother-in-law of yours, are you?

1212
01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.376
Ow!

1213
01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.546
Come on. Fight!

1214
01:25:35.713 --> 01:25:37.965
You thought you had me, didn't you?

1215
01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.675
I'll kill you. I swear!

1216
01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:44.388
No, stop, please! No, please.

1217
01:25:57.652 --> 01:26:00.279
- Hello. Hello there.
- Don't shut the motor off!

1218
01:26:00.446 --> 01:26:03.782
I'm not shutting anything off!
Hello, anybody! Can anybody hear me?

1219
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:07.703
- I can hear you!
- I don't care if you hear me!

1220
01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:08.745
Look, I wanna be...

1221
01:26:08.913 --> 01:26:11.999
- I don't know whether we're on the air.
- Mayday. Call mayday!

1222
01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:16.253
Mayday! Mayday, we're up here!
Can you hear us? Help!

1223
01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:20.757
- Benjy, say something.
- Help! Ah!

1224
01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:23.385
Hello? Billie Sue?

1225
01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:26.263
- Billie Sue, where are you?
- I'm at the bus station.

1226
01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:28.932
I only called because
Mommy said I absolutely...

1227
01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:32.853
Now, sweetie, what are you doing
in the bus station?

1228
01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:35.022
I'm waiting for the bus.

1229
01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:38.192
Your wife's on the other phone.

1230
01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:42.112
Ginger?
I've got Billie Sue on the other line.

1231
01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:44.781
Billie Sue, wait one minute, will you?

1232
01:26:45.325 --> 01:26:46.950
- Ginger?
- I'm here.

1233
01:26:47.118 --> 01:26:49.661
Can you hear Billie Sue?
She's crying.

1234
01:26:49.829 --> 01:26:50.787
Billie Sue!

1235
01:26:50.955 --> 01:26:52.831
She's in the bus station
and she's crying,

1236
01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:54.666
but she's waiting for you to tell her.

1237
01:26:54.834 --> 01:26:57.377
- Billie Sue!
- Are you listening?

1238
01:26:57.545 --> 01:26:58.629
Billie?

1239
01:26:58.796 --> 01:27:01.882
- Are you listening to your mother?
- Your mother is speaking.

1240
01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.968
- Listen to your mother, sweetie.
- Billie Sue!

1241
01:27:05.136 --> 01:27:07.429
Billie Sue! Listen to your mother!

1242
01:27:12.435 --> 01:27:15.437
Everything that's happened
to my daughter and me today...

1243
01:27:15.605 --> 01:27:18.565
...only happened for one reason:
Because you were too stupid...

1244
01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:21.526
...to look where you were going,
and wrecked our car!

1245
01:27:21.694 --> 01:27:25.989
Oh, yeah?

1246
01:27:33.539 --> 01:27:36.500
You either get out of that truck
or I'm going to throw you out.

1247
01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:38.210
Don't get upset.

1248
01:27:38.378 --> 01:27:41.797
You're not going to do anything.
Drive on, you big, stupid idiot.

1249
01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:47.511
Mommy, don't worry.
Your baby's coming to save you!

1250
01:27:51.349 --> 01:27:54.810
Oh! Mr. Pike! Mr. Pike, please!

1251
01:27:54.978 --> 01:27:58.689
- Let me go! Get away from me!
- That isn't nice a bit!

1252
01:27:58.856 --> 01:28:03.318
Mother!

1253
01:28:03.486 --> 01:28:05.779
Help me!

1254
01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:17.124
That's what I'm here for.
That's why you had me, to save you.

1255
01:28:18.876 --> 01:28:21.295
Help me! Ah!

1256
01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:24.214
Emmeline! Ah!

1257
01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:27.718
Yeah, yeah.

1258
01:28:28.886 --> 01:28:30.345
It's practically burned through.

1259
01:28:30.513 --> 01:28:33.515
Just a couple blows
with the sledgehammer and we're out.

1260
01:28:39.605 --> 01:28:40.939
Ah!

1261
01:28:44.235 --> 01:28:45.319
Eh...

1262
01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:00.208
Hey! Wait a minute!

1263
01:29:01.085 --> 01:29:02.627
I can't cross here!

1264
01:29:02.795 --> 01:29:06.631
You said the main road.
This is Niagara Falls.

1265
01:29:06.799 --> 01:29:09.343
All right, look. You're a little boy.

1266
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:12.804
If you want to be a big boy,
which way to the main road?

1267
01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:23.065
Don't!

1268
01:29:23.232 --> 01:29:25.776
It's no! The answer is no.

1269
01:29:25.943 --> 01:29:29.613
He won't back any increase in pensions.
He won't even talk about it.

1270
01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:33.283
There won't be any increase in pensions.
Do you know why?

1271
01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:35.202
Because they got a solid majority...

1272
01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:37.537
...of Republicans and Democrats
who've agreed...

1273
01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:39.831
...that if anything
is said about pensions,

1274
01:29:39.999 --> 01:29:41.958
they'll actually reduce your pension!

1275
01:29:42.126 --> 01:29:44.836
Why? Because they know
that you personally...

1276
01:29:45.004 --> 01:29:48.715
...were more responsible than anybody
else for closing down the houses.

1277
01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:51.301
Could I do anything?
Would he listen to me?

1278
01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:54.888
Ha! All right.
So you're an honest cop...

1279
01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.557
...and you've spent a lifetime
being an honest cop...

1280
01:29:57.725 --> 01:30:00.519
...and you've got that,
and that's all you've got!

1281
01:30:00.686 --> 01:30:02.854
It's no good saying I'm sorry.

1282
01:30:03.022 --> 01:30:06.149
I'm too angry and sick at my stomach
to be sorry.

1283
01:30:06.317 --> 01:30:08.068
You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

1284
01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:10.654
That's the trouble with this family.

1285
01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:15.033
- Melville, I smell something burning.
- Ah...

1286
01:30:18.037 --> 01:30:20.330
- Oh!
- Whoa!

1287
01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:23.250
We're on fire! Come over here.

1288
01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:26.336
Come on. This way.
Go down. Now. Go.

1289
01:30:26.504 --> 01:30:28.004
Hurry up!

1290
01:30:29.173 --> 01:30:30.132
Put it out!

1291
01:30:30.299 --> 01:30:32.676
I don't know how! Get something!

1292
01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:35.011
- The extinguishers.
- Get one!

1293
01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.265
- What'll I do?
- Use it!

1294
01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:39.975
Not on me! On the fire!

1295
01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:41.518
It's too deep!

1296
01:30:41.686 --> 01:30:43.019
This is a car, not a canoe!

1297
01:30:43.187 --> 01:30:45.188
Come on! It's easy!

1298
01:30:45.356 --> 01:30:48.567
If I don't get out of here...
Why? Why?

1299
01:30:51.821 --> 01:30:54.698
All right! Here I come!

1300
01:30:58.703 --> 01:31:00.078
It's too deep!

1301
01:31:00.246 --> 01:31:02.497
It's too deep, you little rat fink!

1302
01:31:02.665 --> 01:31:04.875
Why didn't you tell me it was...
What do I...

1303
01:31:05.042 --> 01:31:07.961
Don't stand there!
Get somebody! Don't...

1304
01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:10.005
This is no place for a convertible!

1305
01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:14.384
I'll get you.

1306
01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:24.895
I'm bleeding, Emmeline!
Look! I'm bleeding!

1307
01:31:25.062 --> 01:31:28.064
Mama!
What did they do to my Mama?

1308
01:31:30.735 --> 01:31:32.736
Ow! Ooh!

1309
01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:46.958
Benjy!

1310
01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.341
It's your father's fault.

1311
01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:57.093
- The whole thing is your father's fault.
- Mommy.

1312
01:31:57.261 --> 01:31:59.095
It's your father's fault.

1313
01:31:59.263 --> 01:32:02.098
What's the matter, Chief?
Something wrong?

1314
01:32:02.266 --> 01:32:05.268
- You know as well as I do...
- Listen and stop yelling!

1315
01:32:05.436 --> 01:32:06.895
Stop it, Billie.

1316
01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:09.105
Billie, you're not listening.

1317
01:32:13.569 --> 01:32:16.738
♪ Well, step into the lobby

1318
01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:20.367

01:32:50.523 --> 01:32:53.149
Now stop it. Stop it, Monica!

1322
01:32:53.317 --> 01:32:55.986
It's only two pieces of small dynamite.

1323
01:32:56.153 --> 01:32:58.697
And they're 70 feet away
in the other room.

1324
01:32:58.864 --> 01:33:02.742
This is a strong counter.
We can't possibly get hurt from there.

1325
01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:23.930
Please, go and stop it.
Stamp on it or something.

1326
01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:27.267
- You know I hate explosions.
- It's perfectly all right.

1327
01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:31.313
I just want to blow a small hole
in the wall, then we'll be out of here.

1328
01:33:42.992 --> 01:33:45.160
Something's happened to the fuse.

1329
01:33:45.328 --> 01:33:47.787
- What could possibly...
- Hold it. Sh!

1330
01:33:47.955 --> 01:33:49.164
Listen.

1331
01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:53.418
The fuse has gone out.
I can't hear it anymore.

1332
01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:57.297
- Stay down. Don't get up.
- I just want to take a look, okay?

1333
01:34:01.177 --> 01:34:03.720
Huh! Now I see.

1334
01:34:05.222 --> 01:34:07.223
It's the fire extinguisher stuff.

1335
01:34:07.391 --> 01:34:10.060
The fire extinguisher stuff got
on the fuse and put it out.

1336
01:34:10.227 --> 01:34:12.479
Melville, don't go in there.
You'll be killed.

1337
01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:16.024
- You'll be blown to bits.
- Monica, for heaven's sake.

1338
01:34:16.192 --> 01:34:18.735
I just want to take a look!

1339
01:34:21.238 --> 01:34:24.616
Why do you always imagine
I can't do things for myself?

1340
01:34:24.784 --> 01:34:26.951
Don't you think I got any sense at all?

1341
01:34:27.787 --> 01:34:29.913
Why can't you have
a little confidence in me?

1342
01:34:43.469 --> 01:34:46.262
Sh! Sh! Sh!

1343
01:35:08.244 --> 01:35:10.954
- I'll never be bad again!
- Whoever said you could fly?

1344
01:35:11.122 --> 01:35:13.206
What do ya want from me?
How long I been flying?

1345
01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:15.667
- Keep it going!
- Can't you talk to that radio?

1346
01:35:15.835 --> 01:35:18.378
Hello, anybody on the ground!
On the ground, anybody!

1347
01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.088
Can you hear us?

1348
01:35:32.476 --> 01:35:35.145
- Stand back!
- Everybody, stand back.

1349
01:35:35.312 --> 01:35:37.939
Stand back, folks. Folks, stand back.

1350
01:35:44.822 --> 01:35:47.157
This is Rancho Conejo Tower.
Do you hear me?

1351
01:35:47.324 --> 01:35:50.577
- We don't know who they are.
- This is Rancho Conejo Tower.

1352
01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:54.330
Aircraft calling Rancho Conejo Tower,
this is Rancho Conejo Tower.

1353
01:35:54.498 --> 01:35:56.332
I got 'em!

1354
01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:59.169
I got 'em!
Hello, down there on the ground.

1355
01:35:59.336 --> 01:36:01.588
This is us in the air. We're in trouble!

1356
01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:04.924
An awful jam. Listen. Hello?

1357
01:36:05.092 --> 01:36:06.593
I think I lost them.

1358
01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:09.179
Wait a minute.
You're not using the set the right way.

1359
01:36:09.346 --> 01:36:13.183
You press your switch in to transmit.
When it's released, you're on receive.

1360
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:16.144
Can you understand me?
This is Rancho Conejo Tower.

1361
01:36:16.312 --> 01:36:20.315
- Where are you and who are you? Over.
- I know how to work it, Benjy!

1362
01:36:20.483 --> 01:36:23.234
I know how to work it.
Hello, down on the ground.

1363
01:36:23.402 --> 01:36:25.069
This is us in the air.

1364
01:36:25.237 --> 01:36:27.197
We're in this fella's plane.

1365
01:36:27.364 --> 01:36:29.032
He knocked himself out...

1366
01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.869
...because he drank a whole case
of bourbon and hit his head.

1367
01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:34.537
What do we do?

1368
01:36:34.705 --> 01:36:37.207
The switch, let go of the switch!

1369
01:36:37.374 --> 01:36:39.542
If you can,
give us your position.

1370
01:36:39.710 --> 01:36:42.212
Who's flying the plane? Over.

1371
01:36:42.379 --> 01:36:45.256
Whaddya mean, "Who's flying the plane?"

1372
01:36:45.424 --> 01:36:47.675
Nobody's flying the plane!

1373
01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:49.886
Sir? Tower here. Emergency.

1374
01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:53.223
Tell him it's a full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.

1375
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:55.892
Full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.

1376
01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.478
It's a Twin Beech.
I saw one here this morning.

1377
01:36:58.646 --> 01:37:01.397
Who's got a Twin Beech?
It's that Col. Wilberforce.

1378
01:37:01.565 --> 01:37:04.776
He was at maintenance.
If he's still there, get him over here.

1379
01:37:04.944 --> 01:37:07.612
Now listen. Don't talk, just listen.

1380
01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:10.573
We're getting things under control,
so you can take it easy.

1381
01:37:10.741 --> 01:37:12.367
We know what kind of a plane you're in.

1382
01:37:12.535 --> 01:37:14.911
We're making necessary preparations
to talk you down.

1383
01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:16.371
Rancho Conejo over.

1384
01:37:16.539 --> 01:37:19.749
Rancho Conejo tower, listen,
we can't land this thing!

1385
01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:22.043
We're in real trouble. Over!

1386
01:37:22.211 --> 01:37:25.588
You'll be perfectly all right
as long as you follow instructions.

1387
01:37:25.756 --> 01:37:29.092
The man at the controls should
also be the man on the radio.

1388
01:37:30.386 --> 01:37:33.429
- Here. Put 'em on.
- No. I don't want to!

1389
01:37:33.597 --> 01:37:34.806
Put 'em on!

1390
01:37:34.974 --> 01:37:37.600
He said the fella flying
should be on this thing.

1391
01:37:37.768 --> 01:37:40.895
Am I supposed to do everything?
You want me to fly, work the radio?

1392
01:37:41.063 --> 01:37:43.314
What are you? The hostess?

1393
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:46.860
No, he's got to take charge.
What's the matter with him?

1394
01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.987
He's just sitting there, rigid-like.

1395
01:37:49.154 --> 01:37:52.532
If he catches you at that keyhole,
you'll be rigid-like.

1396
01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:55.785
- He didn't want to be disturbed.
- He keeps looking at the wall.

1397
01:37:55.953 --> 01:37:58.621
He'll have to be disturbed
if any of this develops further.

1398
01:37:58.789 --> 01:38:03.084
I bet you any amount of money that
we could get on the ball and get...

1399
01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:07.630
Everything's under control, Chief.

1400
01:38:07.798 --> 01:38:11.801
- You okay, Chief?
- Yes. Why?

1401
01:38:11.969 --> 01:38:14.345
- How's it going?
- Something's bound to happen soon.

1402
01:38:14.513 --> 01:38:15.763
Take a look at this.

1403
01:38:15.931 --> 01:38:18.308
Those two in the basement
started a fire...

1404
01:38:18.475 --> 01:38:21.144
...then set off fireworks.
They still didn't get out.

1405
01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:23.897
Those two guys in the airplane
had an accident...

1406
01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:25.481
...knocked the pilot unconscious.

1407
01:38:25.649 --> 01:38:27.984
The control tower
is trying to talk them down.

1408
01:38:30.321 --> 01:38:31.654
The others...

1409
01:38:31.822 --> 01:38:34.407
Aerial report that the man,
Otto Meyer, had an accident.

1410
01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:37.076
He tried to cross a river
and he lost his car.

1411
01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:39.996
Now he's on foot,
walking back to the main road.

1412
01:38:41.165 --> 01:38:43.499
This fella Pike, he's here...

1413
01:38:43.667 --> 01:38:47.629
...coming in on 94 with Mrs. Marcus
and her daughter, Mrs. Finch.

1414
01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:52.842
Mr. Finch and this Algernon,
whatever his name is. The limey.

1415
01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:54.844
They're about five
or six miles behind...

1416
01:38:55.012 --> 01:38:57.805
...in an Avis Chevrolet they rented
in Canyon City.

1417
01:38:57.973 --> 01:39:00.683
And this Sylvester Marcus,
the one the old lady called...

1418
01:39:00.851 --> 01:39:03.186
...he's about here going
in the other direction.

1419
01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:08.441
They all ought to be meeting up
in about five minutes.

1420
01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:26.167
You know what I believe I'd like?

1421
01:39:28.170 --> 01:39:33.341
A chocolate fudge sundae
with whipped cream and a cherry on top.

1422
01:39:48.565 --> 01:39:53.069
Dingy, don't let this worry you.
We're gonna get killed.

1423
01:39:53.237 --> 01:39:55.363
Men,
this is Col. Wilberforce speaking.

1424
01:39:55.531 --> 01:39:59.242
These gentlemen here have asked me
to take charge of this situation...

1425
01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:03.705
...so I immediately said
that I'd be glad to take charge of it.

1426
01:40:03.872 --> 01:40:05.748
Before I say anything else...

1427
01:40:05.916 --> 01:40:08.042
I don't think he's going to
help us, Dingy.

1428
01:40:08.210 --> 01:40:10.211
Yes he is, Benjy. He'll help us.

1429
01:40:10.379 --> 01:40:13.589
Now, just have confidence in him.
He's a colonel. Listen to him.

1430
01:40:14.049 --> 01:40:15.466
Steady, men.

1431
01:40:15.634 --> 01:40:18.803
I'm told that neither of you
has had flying experience.

1432
01:40:18.971 --> 01:40:20.763
Before I say anything else...

1433
01:40:20.931 --> 01:40:24.308
...I want to congratulate you
on having done so well...

1434
01:40:24.476 --> 01:40:26.269
...uh, so far.

1435
01:40:26.437 --> 01:40:30.481
Now, first of all, men,
I'll explain what we intend to do.

1436
01:40:30.649 --> 01:40:34.277
You can't land the airplane
until you've made your approach.

1437
01:40:34.445 --> 01:40:39.407
And you can't make your approach until
you've made a long slow turnaround...

1438
01:40:39.575 --> 01:40:41.200
...down to the south.

1439
01:40:41.368 --> 01:40:43.995
And we've got to be clear
on a few things

1440
01:40:44.163 --> 01:40:46.956
before you can start
that long slow turn.

1441
01:40:47.124 --> 01:40:51.836
Now, the stick that you're holding,
that is, I assume that...

1442
01:40:52.004 --> 01:40:53.796
Men, are you holding that stick?

1443
01:40:53.964 --> 01:40:55.882
Is somebody holding that stick? Over!

1444
01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:59.427
What stick? The wheel.
I'm holding it.

1445
01:40:59.595 --> 01:41:01.679
- We're both holding it.
- Good.

1446
01:41:01.847 --> 01:41:05.141
For a second there, I was afraid...
Never mind that.

1447
01:41:05.309 --> 01:41:08.644
Now I'll explain the controls.
It's important that you understand that.

1448
01:41:08.812 --> 01:41:11.522
Because if you don't,
I'm afraid what might...

1449
01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:34.962
- You want a lift?
- Yes, thank you very much.

1450
01:41:35.130 --> 01:41:37.173
It's nice of you to stop.

1451
01:41:37.341 --> 01:41:40.343
- I'm going as far as Santa Rosita Park.
- That's out of my way.

1452
01:41:40.511 --> 01:41:41.886
- We're blocking traffic.
- We are?

1453
01:41:42.054 --> 01:41:43.179
Let's move it. Move it.

1454
01:41:58.195 --> 01:41:59.779
There we go. All right.

1455
01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:03.032
You hide behind the counter.
I'll light up a fuse.

1456
01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:07.411
Melville, will you just do one thing
for me before you use the dynamite?

1457
01:42:07.579 --> 01:42:10.289
Try hitting the door just once more.

1458
01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:14.544
Honey, I broke my back on that door.
That's a hard door. I mean...

1459
01:42:18.048 --> 01:42:19.799
Okay.

1460
01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:22.051
Where's the sledgehammer?

1461
01:42:28.934 --> 01:42:33.437
This staircase isn't safe anymore.
The fire burned it all out.

1462
01:42:33.605 --> 01:42:34.814
Please?

1463
01:42:37.192 --> 01:42:38.526
All right.

1464
01:42:49.621 --> 01:42:51.497
You're going to...

1465
01:43:01.091 --> 01:43:02.675
Melville, for God...

1466
01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:04.093
Melville!

1467
01:43:07.139 --> 01:43:08.514
Monica...

1468
01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:11.642
...now let's forget about the door, huh?

1469
01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:16.814
Look out!

1470
01:43:16.982 --> 01:43:18.983
- What?
- They've spotted us.

1471
01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:21.194
- Who have?
- Don't stop. Keep going.

1472
01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:23.404
- What is this?
- Helicopter. They've seen us.

1473
01:43:23.572 --> 01:43:24.947
What helicopter?

1474
01:43:27.201 --> 01:43:30.620
- That's a police helicopter.
- They always use them.

1475
01:43:30.787 --> 01:43:33.539
- Who?
- Who do you think? Look...

1476
01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:36.459
I don't want to talk about this,
but they got me hemmed in.

1477
01:43:36.627 --> 01:43:38.461
- Who?
- Will you shut up and listen?

1478
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:42.548
I'm going to break a rule that says
we must never reveal our true identity.

1479
01:43:42.716 --> 01:43:45.468
This is a matter of life or death,
a desperate situation.

1480
01:43:45.636 --> 01:43:48.054
- What is?
- Will you shut up and listen?

1481
01:43:48.222 --> 01:43:51.057
Look, I haven't got much time,
so if you love your country...

1482
01:43:51.225 --> 01:43:53.809
...if you're a patriot, you'll listen,
and listen hard.

1483
01:43:53.977 --> 01:43:55.811
You gotta get to a phone
and make a call.

1484
01:43:55.979 --> 01:43:57.939
- I don't got...
- You got to call Intelligence.

1485
01:43:58.106 --> 01:44:00.107
Central Intelligence Agency
in Washington, D.C.

1486
01:44:00.275 --> 01:44:02.360
- What on earth...
- Now, listen!

1487
01:44:02.527 --> 01:44:05.738
You tell 'em you heard from X-27.
You got it? X-27.

1488
01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:09.367
X-27 told you to tell them they've made
three attempts on my life today.

1489
01:44:09.534 --> 01:44:11.202
They tried to drown me.

1490
01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:13.537
Can you handle a gun? Now, look... Oh!

1491
01:44:13.705 --> 01:44:16.374
There's a cafe. Pull right in there.
You'll use that phone.

1492
01:44:16.541 --> 01:44:18.793
- I don't think I...
- Shut up! You're in no danger.

1493
01:44:18.961 --> 01:44:20.711
They've never seen ya. Now, pull in.

1494
01:44:28.011 --> 01:44:29.845
All right, good. Get to a phone.

1495
01:44:30.013 --> 01:44:33.349
Tell the operator "emergency priority,"
then ask for the CIA.

1496
01:44:33.517 --> 01:44:35.518
Jump out. Come on, come on.

1497
01:44:35.686 --> 01:44:37.561
You're in no danger.
They don't know you.

1498
01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:40.523
You're all right.
I'll duck the car and come back.

1499
01:44:40.691 --> 01:44:42.608
For God's sake,
don't stand in the street.

1500
01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.360
They'll see you. They'll spot you!

1501
01:44:44.528 --> 01:44:46.862
Move it. Yah! Go!

1502
01:45:00.377 --> 01:45:03.879
And... Sylvester! It's Sylvester!
Turn around, you idiot!

1503
01:45:04.047 --> 01:45:06.674
What do you want to stop him for?
He's going the wrong way.

1504
01:45:06.842 --> 01:45:09.468
It's my son. Do as you're told, stupid.

1505
01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:27.069
They're nuts.

1506
01:45:27.237 --> 01:45:30.573
Tell them the tow truck turned around
and is following the Dodge.

1507
01:45:31.199 --> 01:45:33.409
2-1-7-1, 2-1-5-9.

1508
01:45:34.745 --> 01:45:36.412
This is stupid.

1509
01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.080
You call me a stupid idiot.

1510
01:45:38.248 --> 01:45:40.541
Let me tell you something.
You're a stupid idiot.

1511
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:44.628
- He'll go all the way to Plaster City.
- So he goes to Plaster City.

1512
01:45:44.796 --> 01:45:47.423
I don't know about you,
but I'm turning this thing around.

1513
01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:50.801
Now, you want to catch him,
you get out and run.

1514
01:46:11.073 --> 01:46:12.740
Let's stop arguing. Please.

1515
01:46:12.908 --> 01:46:15.618
The reason we're together
is because they only had one car.

1516
01:46:15.786 --> 01:46:18.621
Let's get there, even if we are last.

1517
01:46:18.789 --> 01:46:23.084
Whatever the outcome of the day,
I shall never forget that you hit me...

1518
01:46:23.251 --> 01:46:25.378
...when I wasn't even looking.

1519
01:46:25.545 --> 01:46:26.545
Yeah.

1520
01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:36.847
Russell!

1521
01:46:49.653 --> 01:46:54.115
- How can you be so slow?
- I've had just about enough out of you.

1522
01:46:54.282 --> 01:46:56.033
If ya turned quicker
we could a caught him!

1523
01:46:56.201 --> 01:46:59.245
- Why don't you shut up?
- Russell! There!

1524
01:46:59.413 --> 01:47:01.330
It's Russell and Mr. Hawthorne!

1525
01:47:01.498 --> 01:47:02.665
Stop them! Catch them!

1526
01:47:02.833 --> 01:47:04.166
We gonna start that again?

1527
01:47:04.334 --> 01:47:06.877
Faster! Step on it!
Blow the horn, you big dope!

1528
01:47:07.045 --> 01:47:08.712
What do you want them for anyway?

1529
01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.881
Keep up with them.
You're falling behind.

1530
01:47:11.049 --> 01:47:13.551
Sylvester! Mother! Sylvester!

1531
01:47:13.718 --> 01:47:16.345
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

1532
01:47:21.435 --> 01:47:24.311
I say, what's that chap
honking his hooter for?

1533
01:47:24.479 --> 01:47:27.314
It's probably some road hog
who thinks he owns...

1534
01:47:27.482 --> 01:47:28.774
- What?
- What?

1535
01:47:28.942 --> 01:47:31.861
I got to ask you something about Mama!
Russell, wait a minute!

1536
01:47:32.028 --> 01:47:34.864
- It's my brother-in-law.
- What's he doing?

1537
01:47:35.031 --> 01:47:37.658
Be careful of him. He's not normal.

1538
01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:41.245
You're getting me...
Boy, are you bugging me, man!

1539
01:47:41.413 --> 01:47:45.374
I'm going to nail...
I'm getting bugged now!

1540
01:47:45.542 --> 01:47:46.500
Whoa, man.

1541
01:47:47.878 --> 01:47:50.212
Russell, if you don't pull over,
I'll kill you!

1542
01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:52.381
I'm warning you,
pull over and stop.

1543
01:47:52.549 --> 01:47:53.924
I said stop!

1544
01:47:54.092 --> 01:47:55.718
You asked for it.

1545
01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.311
Russell,
when I get my hands on you...

1546
01:48:06.354 --> 01:48:08.063
What are you doing?

1547
01:48:08.231 --> 01:48:09.732
- I said stop!
- Are you crazy?

1548
01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:12.067
- We'll get killed!
- Pull over!

1549
01:48:22.454 --> 01:48:25.915
Don't you know what I mean?
I said stop that car!

1550
01:48:31.296 --> 01:48:34.590
When I get my hands on you, Russell,
I will kill you!

1551
01:48:53.443 --> 01:48:55.110
Are you crazy?

1552
01:48:55.278 --> 01:48:57.321
Ah!

1553
01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:06.622
I've never seen anything
like this bunch.

1554
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:09.458
He ran right into them,
ran them right off the road.

1555
01:49:10.627 --> 01:49:14.296
- You guys, come on out of there!
- Fellow's absolutely beside himself.

1556
01:49:14.464 --> 01:49:16.882
- What are you trying to do?
- Let's go!

1557
01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:19.510
- What did you do to my mother?
- We wouldn't do any...

1558
01:49:20.554 --> 01:49:21.637
Move! Move!

1559
01:49:21.805 --> 01:49:25.307
- What did you do to my mother?
- I didn't do anything! Let me explain.

1560
01:49:25.475 --> 01:49:26.809
Look here.

1561
01:49:27.644 --> 01:49:29.144
She called me. She phoned me.

1562
01:49:29.312 --> 01:49:31.981
What she told me was so horrible,
I thought she'd gone nuts!

1563
01:49:32.148 --> 01:49:33.649
- It was true, wasn't it?
- It's not true.

1564
01:49:33.817 --> 01:49:36.610
Whoever told you was a liar.
It's not true.

1565
01:49:36.778 --> 01:49:39.530
- It is true!
- Now, look here!

1566
01:49:41.074 --> 01:49:43.200
Are you English? Just answer me!

1567
01:49:43.368 --> 01:49:46.662
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.
Don't you like the English?

1568
01:49:50.125 --> 01:49:51.417
There was an Englishman.

1569
01:49:51.585 --> 01:49:54.628
She said that you and this Englishman...
I'll kill you!

1570
01:49:56.006 --> 01:49:57.673
What did you do to my Mama?

1571
01:49:57.841 --> 01:50:00.801
- Emmeline!
- Mama!

1572
01:50:00.969 --> 01:50:03.762
Why couldn't you listen?
Why couldn't you shut up...

1573
01:50:03.930 --> 01:50:05.514
...when I was trying
to tell you to listen?

1574
01:50:05.682 --> 01:50:08.642
That chap's run absolutely amok!

1575
01:50:09.811 --> 01:50:11.353
Few minutes, we'll have 'em in position.

1576
01:50:11.521 --> 01:50:14.356
In a couple of minutes,
we'll have you in position.

1577
01:50:14.524 --> 01:50:16.900
- You're doing a great job, Colonel.
- Thank you.

1578
01:50:17.068 --> 01:50:19.528
Why not just shoot 'em down?

1579
01:50:20.113 --> 01:50:23.032
None of these people must suspect...

1580
01:50:23.199 --> 01:50:26.035
...that they have ever been
under observation.

1581
01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.204
Now, none of them have ever seen me.

1582
01:50:29.372 --> 01:50:30.914
None of them know me...

1583
01:50:31.082 --> 01:50:33.792
...so I'll be moving in alone.

1584
01:50:35.045 --> 01:50:37.963
The minute I move in,
I'll give you the word.

1585
01:50:38.131 --> 01:50:40.132
And when you pass the word...

1586
01:50:41.384 --> 01:50:44.845
...I don't want to have another
policeman within miles of me.

1587
01:50:45.013 --> 01:50:46.388
- Right?
- Right.

1588
01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:50.768
I, uh...

1589
01:50:50.935 --> 01:50:54.396
I won't like it
if I see another policeman.

1590
01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:57.024
I give you my word.

1591
01:50:57.192 --> 01:51:00.736
I wanted to stop for you.
My wife and he wanted to stop for you.

1592
01:51:00.904 --> 01:51:03.197
Tell him how my mother-in-law
made us drive by him.

1593
01:51:03.365 --> 01:51:05.658
Anything you have to say
about your mother-in-law...

1594
01:51:05.825 --> 01:51:07.242
...you don't have to explain to me.

1595
01:51:07.410 --> 01:51:08.494
You know what I mean?

1596
01:51:08.662 --> 01:51:11.622
If she were a star
of a real crummy horror movie...

1597
01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:14.333
...I'd believe it.

1598
01:51:15.085 --> 01:51:16.001
Yeah!

1599
01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:17.211
That's him!

1600
01:51:17.379 --> 01:51:20.589
If I catch you, I'll kill you!
I tell you, I'll kill you!

1601
01:51:20.757 --> 01:51:22.925
You dirty robber!

1602
01:51:23.093 --> 01:51:24.718
Someone you know?

1603
01:51:40.276 --> 01:51:42.152
I'll drive. All set?

1604
01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:43.987
All set, Chief.

1605
01:51:44.155 --> 01:51:45.823
Culpeper, all set?

1606
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.907
Yes, sir.

1607
01:51:47.075 --> 01:51:49.785
Airport just reported
and they're starting an approach now.

1608
01:51:49.953 --> 01:51:51.078
Right.

1609
01:51:58.962 --> 01:52:01.380
What's the matter, Chief?
You forgotten something?

1610
01:52:03.967 --> 01:52:06.552
No. I don't think
I've forgotten a thing.

1611
01:52:17.897 --> 01:52:22.192
Now, men, about the brakes...
You've got to know about the brakes.

1612
01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:26.488
I'll tell you
in just a minute. Just hold it a second.

1613
01:52:26.656 --> 01:52:28.907
What the hell is with this wire?

1614
01:52:29.075 --> 01:52:31.118
Just hold it a second.

1615
01:52:31.286 --> 01:52:32.661
What was that?

1616
01:52:32.829 --> 01:52:33.912
Men, look.

1617
01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:38.417
Be calm. This is it.
Just one minute more, it'll be all over.

1618
01:52:38.585 --> 01:52:41.128
I mean, it'll all be over.
I mean, courage, men.

1619
01:52:41.296 --> 01:52:44.339
We're all with you every second.

1620
01:52:44.507 --> 01:52:47.176
We're pulling for you
as hard as we can.

1621
01:52:47.343 --> 01:52:49.970
Now it's just hold onto
your nerves, men,

1622
01:52:50.138 --> 01:52:52.055
and not get excited
or do anything foolish.

1623
01:52:52.223 --> 01:52:54.516
But just keep calm.
That's all we'll do.

1624
01:52:54.684 --> 01:52:56.935
Keep calm. Calm, men!

1625
01:53:00.815 --> 01:53:02.524
Not that calm, you idiot!

1626
01:53:07.238 --> 01:53:09.114
Pull up!

1627
01:53:22.086 --> 01:53:24.171
Now, don't worry. Just keep calm.

1628
01:53:25.381 --> 01:53:28.050
What's this?
What's this that's coming?

1629
01:53:28.218 --> 01:53:32.679
- That's good. That's cement.
- What? Wait a minute! Hold it!

1630
01:53:32.847 --> 01:53:34.890
What are you doing, Benjy?

1631
01:53:40.897 --> 01:53:42.898
- What, are you trying to scare me?
- No!

1632
01:53:43.066 --> 01:53:44.566
Well, you did.

1633
01:53:47.028 --> 01:53:50.239
It's just a couple of sticks
of dynamite, that's all.

1634
01:53:50.406 --> 01:53:54.076
How much noise could it make?
Boom. It's all over.

1635
01:53:54.244 --> 01:53:56.078
Get it over right! Get it over!

1636
01:53:56.246 --> 01:53:57.246
Left rudder!

1637
01:53:57.413 --> 01:53:59.373
Too low! Pull up.

1638
01:53:59.541 --> 01:54:00.916
No! Left rudder!

1639
01:54:01.084 --> 01:54:04.211
No! Pull it up!

1640
01:54:04.379 --> 01:54:05.462
Help!

1641
01:54:07.549 --> 01:54:11.093
Help!
I'm the Colonel, you know!

1642
01:54:11.261 --> 01:54:12.261
Help!

1643
01:54:12.428 --> 01:54:14.805
Help! Get me down!

1644
01:54:17.767 --> 01:54:19.935
We're not going to land
and we'll never make it.

1645
01:54:20.103 --> 01:54:23.605
What do you mean, we'll never make it?
Don't freeze.

1646
01:54:23.773 --> 01:54:25.691
Benjy, don't freeze.

1647
01:54:29.821 --> 01:54:31.446
This one's going to work.

1648
01:54:31.614 --> 01:54:33.615
- Damn it, come to!
- You hit me.

1649
01:54:33.783 --> 01:54:36.535
Listen, wait a minute.

1650
01:54:43.001 --> 01:54:44.585
We're down!

1651
01:54:44.752 --> 01:54:46.628
- We're on the ground.
- Hooray!

1652
01:54:46.796 --> 01:54:49.882
It's just a noise, that's all.
It's way over there.

1653
01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:55.512
Put on the brakes.

1654
01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:57.055
Okay. Where are they?

1655
01:54:57.223 --> 01:54:59.349
Benjy! Here comes a restaurant!

1656
01:55:07.108 --> 01:55:08.692
We've landed! Come on.

1657
01:55:14.949 --> 01:55:17.534
Come on. Hurry. Now, hurry up.

1658
01:55:17.702 --> 01:55:19.703
- Come on, let's go.
- What about him?

1659
01:55:19.871 --> 01:55:21.914
Never mind him.
An ambulance will come.

1660
01:55:22.081 --> 01:55:23.874
Let's get out of here.

1661
01:55:25.710 --> 01:55:27.711
Cab!

1662
01:55:28.254 --> 01:55:30.923
Cab!

1663
01:55:31.382 --> 01:55:34.301
We're in an awful hurry.
Do you know where the State Park is?

1664
01:55:34.469 --> 01:55:36.386
Sure. What happened?

1665
01:55:36.554 --> 01:55:38.263
Emergency landing. Come on, hurry.

1666
01:55:38.431 --> 01:55:40.182
Quick, let's go. Come on.

1667
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:41.767
Come on, Benjy.

1668
01:55:54.447 --> 01:55:56.990
Oh! Excuse me.

1669
01:56:01.955 --> 01:56:03.872
Excuse us. Here's your bag.

1670
01:56:05.458 --> 01:56:07.626
You see, the lock didn't work.

1671
01:56:07.794 --> 01:56:08.710
Go.

1672
01:56:08.878 --> 01:56:12.798
That's all.
The owners will pay for everything.

1673
01:56:12.966 --> 01:56:15.300
Next door, he'll pay for everything.
It's okay.

1674
01:56:23.935 --> 01:56:25.435
You people. You!

1675
01:56:25.603 --> 01:56:27.562
Come back here. Come back!

1676
01:56:27.730 --> 01:56:29.523
You vandals!

1677
01:56:29.691 --> 01:56:33.068
The cops in this town
are morons, retarded.

1678
01:56:33.236 --> 01:56:35.070
I'm dealing with moronic people.

1679
01:56:35.238 --> 01:56:37.572
'Cause he's in a bad humor,
that fat Nazi.

1680
01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:39.366
What, I gotta suffer 'cause of him?

1681
01:56:39.534 --> 01:56:42.119
Get away from me.
What's the matter?

1682
01:56:42.286 --> 01:56:46.748
Can't you see I'm on the phone?
Gimme two minutes!

1683
01:56:46.916 --> 01:56:48.542
Now, listen, Sy...

1684
01:56:49.168 --> 01:56:51.586
Will you take us
to Santa Rosita State Park?

1685
01:56:51.754 --> 01:56:54.297
What's the matter?
What happened to you? Initiation?

1686
01:56:54.465 --> 01:56:56.258
We had an accident. Hurry up!

1687
01:56:57.093 --> 01:56:59.720
Benjamin and Bell stopped
at a gardener supply place

1688
01:56:59.887 --> 01:57:01.847
and bought picks and shovels.

1689
01:57:02.015 --> 01:57:04.558
Hold it, Chief.
Here's a report on the Crumps.

1690
01:57:04.726 --> 01:57:09.104
Their cab turned onto 101 moving south
toward your present position.

1691
01:57:09.272 --> 01:57:13.316
Wait. The other taxi's
also turning onto 101...

1692
01:57:13.484 --> 01:57:16.528
...and they're moving north.
They're both coming your way.

1693
01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:17.779
Understood.

1694
01:57:17.947 --> 01:57:19.281
Stand by.

1695
01:57:19.449 --> 01:57:22.409
- They ought to be here any minute.
- Uh-huh.

1696
01:57:45.975 --> 01:57:47.225
Look.

1697
01:57:47.393 --> 01:57:51.104
It's the two idiots, the little one and
the one with the marbles in his mouth.

1698
01:57:51.272 --> 01:57:54.024
- It's that hokey dentist.
- Yeah.

1699
01:57:54.192 --> 01:57:55.400
Pass that cab.

1700
01:57:55.568 --> 01:57:57.235
- What's the rush?
- Whaddaya mean "rush"?

1701
01:57:57.403 --> 01:57:59.780
No rush. We're just in a hurry.

1702
01:58:08.289 --> 01:58:09.831
Culpeper.

1703
01:58:09.999 --> 01:58:11.500
Now.

1704
01:58:11.667 --> 01:58:13.502
Give the order to pull away.

1705
01:58:19.842 --> 01:58:22.219
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Shouldn't I wait around?

1706
01:58:22.386 --> 01:58:23.345
No. Here's $5.

1707
01:58:23.513 --> 01:58:27.140
- What's with the pick and shovel?
- Mind your own business. Come on.

1708
01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:32.479
Hey! Hey!

1709
01:58:33.356 --> 01:58:35.232
- Think anybody is here?
- Didn't see any cars.

1710
01:58:35.399 --> 01:58:37.067
Wait a minute!

1711
01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:40.028
- Let's talk this over.
- I got nothing to talk about.

1712
01:58:40.196 --> 01:58:41.822
Wait a minute.

1713
01:58:41.989 --> 01:58:43.365
Think anybody else has been here?

1714
01:58:43.533 --> 01:58:45.784
- How should I know?
- Wait!

1715
01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:48.703
If you think we're the first ones here,
why not make a deal?

1716
01:58:48.871 --> 01:58:49.830
The four of us?

1717
01:58:49.997 --> 01:58:52.332
Nobody knows where to look,
so we'll look together.

1718
01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:57.045
We'll find it before the others.
Incidentally, where are all the others?

1719
01:58:57.213 --> 01:59:00.882
How come you two just got here?
You had the plane.

1720
01:59:01.050 --> 01:59:04.553
Yeah... What happened to you?

1721
01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:07.389
They're up to something funny,
you hear?

1722
01:59:07.557 --> 01:59:11.393
Did you see the blonde I brought,
covered in paint with her dress ripped?

1723
01:59:11.561 --> 01:59:13.103
What's that all about?

1724
01:59:13.271 --> 01:59:16.898
Yeah. And what about
the picks and shovels?

1725
01:59:25.658 --> 01:59:29.119
You run back to headquarters.
Wait till you hear from me.

1726
01:59:29.287 --> 01:59:30.412
Let me come, Chief.

1727
01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:33.290
I'd like to,
but it might snarl things up.

1728
01:59:34.333 --> 01:59:36.251
Thanks for everything.

1729
01:59:36.419 --> 01:59:38.211
Lots of luck, Chief.

1730
02:00:12.955 --> 02:00:15.916
Benjy! Did you see anything, pal?

1731
02:00:16.083 --> 02:00:18.501
No, but there must be
something somewhere.

1732
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:21.338
Yeah... Hey! Hey!

1733
02:00:22.673 --> 02:00:24.299
- See anything?
- Not a thing.

1734
02:00:24.467 --> 02:00:27.636
Are you sure he didn't say
something you've forgotten?

1735
02:00:27.803 --> 02:00:31.556
He said it's buried under a big W
and that we'd see it.

1736
02:00:31.724 --> 02:00:33.975
- It's gotta be here.
- I tell you what we do.

1737
02:00:34.143 --> 02:00:36.353
You go how we came.
We'll go how you came.

1738
02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:38.897
We might have missed something.
Hold it.

1739
02:00:39.982 --> 02:00:41.942
You go the way we came...

1740
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:44.027
That's right. Okay, let's go.

1741
02:00:51.661 --> 02:00:54.162
They're looking for something
buried under a big W.

1742
02:00:54.330 --> 02:00:57.040
I heard one of them,
the stutterer, say it.

1743
02:00:57.208 --> 02:00:59.542
Yeah, I heard. But what?

1744
02:01:48.009 --> 02:01:49.217
Hey!

1745
02:01:49.385 --> 02:01:50.677
Did you see anything?

1746
02:01:50.845 --> 02:01:52.137
- No. Did you?
- Nothing.

1747
02:01:52.305 --> 02:01:54.889
That guy hid it so good,
he couldn't find it himself.

1748
02:01:55.057 --> 02:01:56.057
I think...

1749
02:02:06.235 --> 02:02:07.402
Who's he?

1750
02:02:07.570 --> 02:02:10.238
- I don't know.
- But he had a shovel.

1751
02:02:10.406 --> 02:02:11.865
Maybe he's a prospector.

1752
02:02:12.033 --> 02:02:14.117
- What are you talking...
- We're wasting time.

1753
02:02:14.285 --> 02:02:16.036
Harder. We gotta look harder!

1754
02:02:16.203 --> 02:02:18.496
Let's look harder. Come on, let's go.

1755
02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:31.760
Who's he?

1756
02:02:31.927 --> 02:02:34.095
I don't know,
but he hasn't got a shovel.

1757
02:02:42.438 --> 02:02:44.689
- He's here, I tell ya.
- Yes, sir. That's his car.

1758
02:02:44.857 --> 02:02:47.734
- I'll get that phony.
- Somebody must've come in those cabs.

1759
02:02:47.902 --> 02:02:51.363
- Come on, let's get moving!
- Come on, let's get moving!

1760
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:54.449
- They must be here.
- They'd better be. Come on, Emmeline.

1761
02:02:54.617 --> 02:02:57.243
- Don't just sit there!
- Don't just sit there!

1762
02:02:57.411 --> 02:02:59.204
Yes, I am.

1763
02:02:59.372 --> 02:03:01.456
Then sit!

1764
02:03:01.624 --> 02:03:04.334
Mrs. Finch,
aren't you the teeniest bit curious?

1765
02:03:04.502 --> 02:03:08.546
No. I'm not even curious,
just disgusted.

1766
02:03:08.714 --> 02:03:12.384
I say, that really is a pity.
Do forgive me, I must go.

1767
02:03:19.683 --> 02:03:21.976
Psst!

1768
02:03:22.144 --> 02:03:24.479
You wouldn't know a big W
if you saw one!

1769
02:03:24.647 --> 02:03:25.980
- I know a...
- Shut up!

1770
02:03:26.148 --> 02:03:29.025
I don't care what you say,
I don't think they're here yet.

1771
02:03:29.193 --> 02:03:31.820
They're here somewhere.
That means they haven't found it.

1772
02:03:31.987 --> 02:03:34.155
That's all he said? "Under a big W"?

1773
02:03:34.323 --> 02:03:36.616
Actually, I joined the party after that.

1774
02:03:36.784 --> 02:03:39.160
Yes, sir, that's what he said.
It's under a big W.

1775
02:03:39.328 --> 02:03:42.831
- Let's look...
- Will you shut up and follow me?

1776
02:04:37.136 --> 02:04:38.428
- Who's that?
- I don't know!

1777
02:04:38.596 --> 02:04:40.388
- From this morning?
- Yes.

1778
02:04:43.058 --> 02:04:45.226
- Who's he?
- I don't know.

1779
02:04:46.770 --> 02:04:48.354
- Who's he?
- I don't know!

1780
02:04:48.522 --> 02:04:51.441
Mama, how many people
are mixed up in this?

1781
02:04:52.610 --> 02:04:55.278
Mama, who are they? Cabbies?

1782
02:04:55.446 --> 02:04:57.363
Mama, this thing's like a convention.

1783
02:05:34.568 --> 02:05:37.237
Is anything wrong, ma'am?
I didn't mean to startle you.

1784
02:05:37.404 --> 02:05:41.157
Who are you? Are you with the others,
the ones that are looking?

1785
02:05:41.325 --> 02:05:43.660
- I am, in a way. Aren't you?
- No.

1786
02:05:43.827 --> 02:05:46.913
I mean, I didn't want anything
to do with it right from the start.

1787
02:05:47.081 --> 02:05:48.957
And you know what?

1788
02:05:49.124 --> 02:05:53.628
I know where it is. I'm the only one,
and I wasn't even looking.

1789
02:05:53.796 --> 02:05:55.088
You know where it is?

1790
02:05:55.256 --> 02:05:57.298
Yes! What should I do?

1791
02:05:58.884 --> 02:06:00.843
Ugh!

1792
02:06:01.011 --> 02:06:03.012
Come on out, everyone!
This is ridiculous.

1793
02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:05.515
- I absolutely agree.
- Come on out.

1794
02:06:05.683 --> 02:06:08.142
We all know we're all here.
Nobody's fooling anyone.

1795
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:09.811
So we all know. So what?

1796
02:06:09.979 --> 02:06:12.146
Don't talk to my mama
in that tone of voice!

1797
02:06:12.314 --> 02:06:13.648
- You hear?
- Shut up!

1798
02:06:13.816 --> 02:06:17.694
Listen, we ain't the only ones here.
I seen four or five others.

1799
02:06:17.861 --> 02:06:19.320
Those two cab drivers.

1800
02:06:19.488 --> 02:06:22.490
- They came with us and that dentist.
- You want to start?

1801
02:06:22.658 --> 02:06:25.827
- Yes, I want to...
- Why are we wasting time?

1802
02:06:25.995 --> 02:06:27.370
We're all here.

1803
02:06:27.538 --> 02:06:31.040
Even if somebody finds the money,
nobody gets away with it...

1804
02:06:31.208 --> 02:06:33.251
...unless everybody gets a share.

1805
02:06:33.419 --> 02:06:36.296
Let's all get sensible
and get this organized.

1806
02:06:36.463 --> 02:06:39.173
Did you all hear what Mama said?

1807
02:06:39.341 --> 02:06:41.884
- Come on, Mama.
- Now, wait a minute.

1808
02:06:42.052 --> 02:06:45.179
Did any of you see a guy with glasses...

1809
02:06:45.347 --> 02:06:47.974
...with a sneery expression on his face?

1810
02:06:48.142 --> 02:06:51.311
This guy was ugly.
I mean, like, real ugly.

1811
02:06:55.357 --> 02:06:59.902
If you help dig it up,
you can have half and I'll have half.

1812
02:07:00.070 --> 02:07:02.697
Is that okay? I mean, is that fair?

1813
02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:05.742
If I have half of the money...

1814
02:07:05.909 --> 02:07:09.203
...I can go away somewhere
where nobody can find me.

1815
02:07:09.371 --> 02:07:14.375
Not Russell or my mother
or Sylvester, anybody.

1816
02:07:15.336 --> 02:07:17.587
You don't know what that'd mean.

1817
02:07:17.755 --> 02:07:19.047
If I had enough money...

1818
02:07:19.214 --> 02:07:22.592
...I might be able to live
in a convent or something.

1819
02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:24.719
- In a convent?
- Uh-huh.

1820
02:07:24.887 --> 02:07:27.555
We all know we're all here.

1821
02:07:27.723 --> 02:07:30.725
It seems intelligent to me
that we should all share...

1822
02:07:30.893 --> 02:07:33.019
...in one equal share apiece, right?

1823
02:07:33.187 --> 02:07:34.228
Right. Mel was right.

1824
02:07:34.396 --> 02:07:36.939
We all know that. Lookit...

1825
02:07:37.107 --> 02:07:39.692
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah. Mm-hm.

1826
02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:42.153
It's him, all right. Yeah!

1827
02:07:43.113 --> 02:07:46.240
You got this wrong.
I came to apologize.

1828
02:07:46.408 --> 02:07:49.535
Forgive and forget! I'm your friend.

1829
02:07:49.703 --> 02:07:52.080
He's so neurotic.
Can't you do something?

1830
02:07:52.247 --> 02:07:53.039
I'll get you.

1831
02:07:53.207 --> 02:07:57.502
- He's very neurotic. I'm your friend!
- When I get my hands on you...

1832
02:08:09.556 --> 02:08:10.640
Why, that's it.

1833
02:08:10.808 --> 02:08:12.767
Sure. Look!

1834
02:08:12.935 --> 02:08:15.019
It's the big W, I tell you!

1835
02:08:15.187 --> 02:08:17.522
It's the big W!

1836
02:08:19.775 --> 02:08:20.692
Look at this.

1837
02:08:20.859 --> 02:08:23.444
Look at it!

1838
02:08:28.117 --> 02:08:29.909
I'm sorry, Mrs. Finch.

1839
02:08:31.328 --> 02:08:33.496
I'm afraid it's too late.

1840
02:08:33.664 --> 02:08:35.623
I think they've found it.

1841
02:08:37.167 --> 02:08:40.128
Right here all the time!
He wasn't kidding!

1842
02:08:40.295 --> 02:08:44.465
- He was telling the truth!
- Folks, isn't this great?

1843
02:08:45.134 --> 02:08:47.927
Congratulations. Well done.

1844
02:08:48.095 --> 02:08:51.639
Listen, I think the big boy
should get an extra share.

1845
02:08:51.807 --> 02:08:53.850
After all, it was he who found it.

1846
02:08:54.017 --> 02:08:57.270
Yes! I insist he gets an extra share.

1847
02:08:57.438 --> 02:08:59.731
That's right.
He deserves an extra share.

1848
02:08:59.898 --> 02:09:02.483
- Well, I...
- Let's start digging.

1849
02:09:02.651 --> 02:09:04.819
Suppose somebody comes along.
What do we tell him?

1850
02:09:04.987 --> 02:09:07.739
We're here with
an anthropological expedition.

1851
02:09:07.906 --> 02:09:09.615
- Nah.
- We don't tell them anything!

1852
02:09:09.783 --> 02:09:12.201
We tell them to scram
or we beat their brains in.

1853
02:09:12.995 --> 02:09:14.912
It was a nice dream.

1854
02:09:16.165 --> 02:09:18.082
Lasted almost five minutes.

1855
02:09:28.093 --> 02:09:30.303
Now, don't bug me, I said.

1856
02:09:30.471 --> 02:09:32.221
Faster.

1857
02:09:32.389 --> 02:09:34.098
Come on, dig, dig.

1858
02:09:34.266 --> 02:09:36.309
Faster, faster.

1859
02:09:36.477 --> 02:09:39.145
Faster. Dig. That's it, dig.

1860
02:10:34.243 --> 02:10:35.284
Faster.

1861
02:10:48.924 --> 02:10:52.009
There's not enough room.
You two, out.

1862
02:10:52.177 --> 02:10:53.761
Let us do it.

1863
02:11:00.102 --> 02:11:03.604
Wait. There's not enough room.
You're bugging me.

1864
02:11:03.772 --> 02:11:05.857
- "Bugging"?
- Cut out, cut out.

1865
02:11:06.024 --> 02:11:07.316
What's this "cut out" talk?

1866
02:11:07.484 --> 02:11:09.735
- Out, baby. Out!
- Don't call me baby.

1867
02:11:09.903 --> 02:11:13.531
- Quit arguing!
- Will ya come on?

1868
02:11:24.334 --> 02:11:26.711
- What's that?
- What was that?

1869
02:11:28.130 --> 02:11:29.839
- That's it.
- Sounded like a chest.

1870
02:11:30.007 --> 02:11:32.216
I wonder what's in it.

1871
02:11:32.384 --> 02:11:33.885
Bring it up here!

1872
02:11:41.059 --> 02:11:43.144
There it is!

1873
02:11:43.312 --> 02:11:45.146
- It's a satchel.
- Hold it up!

1874
02:11:46.648 --> 02:11:49.859
- It's a satchel!
- I got it.

1875
02:11:50.903 --> 02:11:52.153
Open it up.

1876
02:11:52.321 --> 02:11:53.654
Come on!

1877
02:11:55.991 --> 02:11:57.783
Bingo!

1878
02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:01.662
I say, chaps,
shouldn't we find a spot of cover?

1879
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:02.997
There's nobody around.

1880
02:12:03.165 --> 02:12:04.665
Come on. Count it out.

1881
02:12:04.833 --> 02:12:07.126
- What are we waiting for?
- Now wait a second!

1882
02:12:07.294 --> 02:12:11.505
Everybody's going to get something, so
no arguments. We all get equal shares!

1883
02:12:11.673 --> 02:12:12.840
He's right.

1884
02:12:13.008 --> 02:12:15.927
That's the only way to do it.
Shares for everybody.

1885
02:12:16.094 --> 02:12:18.220
Now, how many are we?

1886
02:12:18.388 --> 02:12:20.264
One, two...

1887
02:12:20.432 --> 02:12:24.727
...three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

1888
02:12:25.604 --> 02:12:30.358
...9, 10, 11, 12, 13...

1889
02:12:30.525 --> 02:12:32.735
...14, 15.

1890
02:12:32.903 --> 02:12:35.529
15 of us. That means 15 equal shares.

1891
02:12:35.697 --> 02:12:39.283
You dirty double-crosser.
You cut yourself in for twice!

1892
02:12:39.451 --> 02:12:41.494
You can't get away with that!

1893
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:42.954
Get him!

1894
02:12:43.121 --> 02:12:44.372
Grab him!

1895
02:12:44.539 --> 02:12:45.915
Get him!

1896
02:12:48.001 --> 02:12:51.504
You only cheated yourself
because now you're out.

1897
02:12:51.672 --> 02:12:55.341
Listen!
You can't cut me out now, you hear?

1898
02:12:55.509 --> 02:12:57.259
Not after what I've been through!

1899
02:12:58.220 --> 02:12:59.720
All right. Okay.

1900
02:12:59.888 --> 02:13:04.016
I'm warning you, if I don't get a share,
I'm going straight to the police.

1901
02:13:04.184 --> 02:13:07.436
- The police?
- What makes you think the police...

1902
02:13:08.146 --> 02:13:10.314
That money had to come from somewhere.

1903
02:13:10.482 --> 02:13:14.902
We know where it's from,
that poor man that died on the mountain.

1904
02:13:15.070 --> 02:13:17.488
You wasn't even there, so shut up.

1905
02:13:17.656 --> 02:13:21.033
Okay, you asked for it.
I'm going straight to the police.

1906
02:13:21.201 --> 02:13:23.703
You think they'd be interested,
Mr. Meyer?

1907
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:26.288
Are you kidding? Isn't it obvious?

1908
02:13:26.456 --> 02:13:28.082
How do you think money gets...

1909
02:13:31.461 --> 02:13:32.920
How did you know my name?

1910
02:13:33.088 --> 02:13:34.505
You know this crook?

1911
02:13:34.673 --> 02:13:39.635
I've never met him, Mr. Pike,
but I've come to feel that I know him.

1912
02:13:40.595 --> 02:13:43.597
How did you know my name?
I've never met you.

1913
02:13:43.765 --> 02:13:46.517
Yeah, who are you?

1914
02:13:46.685 --> 02:13:48.227
Didn't he come with you?

1915
02:13:48.395 --> 02:13:51.313
He didn't come with us.
We thought he came with you.

1916
02:13:51.481 --> 02:13:52.773
No.

1917
02:13:52.941 --> 02:13:57.153
If he didn't come with us,
then who are you?

1918
02:13:58.030 --> 02:14:00.114
I'm Capt. Culpeper...

1919
02:14:00.282 --> 02:14:02.408
...of the Santa Rosita
Police Department.

1920
02:14:07.914 --> 02:14:10.416
- Will you come to the point?
- Yeah, I'm coming to it.

1921
02:14:10.584 --> 02:14:14.295
Point is, I have enough stuff
in my private files...

1922
02:14:14.463 --> 02:14:16.630
...stuff relating to civic building...

1923
02:14:16.798 --> 02:14:20.051
...road contracts,
harbor and cannery projects...

1924
02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:22.970
...enough stuff to put you,
the D.A., myself...

1925
02:14:23.138 --> 02:14:27.475
...and a two-thirds majority behind bars
for the next 20 years.

1926
02:14:27.642 --> 02:14:31.645
And I give you my word, that's
exactly where everybody's going...

1927
02:14:31.813 --> 02:14:36.192
- ...unless things start happening now.
- Like what, for instance?

1928
02:14:36.359 --> 02:14:39.445
I want the pension
for Culpeper's grade trebled.

1929
02:14:39.613 --> 02:14:43.908
Not doubled, trebled.
I want Culpeper to retire with honor.

1930
02:14:44.076 --> 02:14:48.162
I want it on paper that
that's exactly what's going to happen.

1931
02:14:48.330 --> 02:14:51.123
And I want it in my hands
in 15 minutes...

1932
02:14:51.291 --> 02:14:54.251
...or I'll have all the reporters
in town in here in 20.

1933
02:14:55.003 --> 02:14:59.256
You know the word for this, Your Honor.
It's called blackmail.

1934
02:15:17.484 --> 02:15:21.237
Sir, could you possibly see
your way clear to give us a break?

1935
02:15:21.404 --> 02:15:23.489
You kidding? Him give you a break?

1936
02:15:23.657 --> 02:15:26.450
We had a pretty rough day already.

1937
02:15:26.618 --> 02:15:30.204
We was all covered with dirt,
and we fell down in an airplane...

1938
02:15:30.372 --> 02:15:32.998
...and my grandmother's dying in Oxnard.

1939
02:15:33.166 --> 02:15:35.376
I know we don't deserve
any kindness, Captain.

1940
02:15:35.544 --> 02:15:39.505
But if you could help us,
I'm sure we'd all be inspired...

1941
02:15:39.673 --> 02:15:41.382
...to live better lives.

1942
02:15:41.550 --> 02:15:43.634
Well, there is one thing.

1943
02:15:44.594 --> 02:15:46.929
I don't know
whether it would help or not.

1944
02:15:47.097 --> 02:15:51.433
But if, instead of my turning you in...

1945
02:15:51.601 --> 02:15:54.061
...you went and turned yourselves in...

1946
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:58.065
...juries sometimes look very favorably
on things like that.

1947
02:15:58.233 --> 02:16:00.734
You'd let us do that?

1948
02:16:00.902 --> 02:16:03.320
What are we waiting for?
Let's turn ourselves in.

1949
02:16:03.488 --> 02:16:05.072
You must be a fine human being.

1950
02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:07.992
After all, why should you worry
whether we get a break?

1951
02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.245
Well, Mr. Meyer,
no matter what you've all done today...

1952
02:16:11.413 --> 02:16:14.582
...you're not really criminals.

1953
02:16:14.749 --> 02:16:17.668
So if you like,
you can all hop into those two cabs...

1954
02:16:17.836 --> 02:16:20.880
...and drive over to Santa Rosita...

1955
02:16:21.047 --> 02:16:24.258
...and, uh, just walk in.

1956
02:16:24.426 --> 02:16:27.928
- Then let's do that.
- But, sir, we can't all fit.

1957
02:16:28.096 --> 02:16:32.391
You can't take the stolen vehicles.
Those have to stay to be picked up.

1958
02:16:32.559 --> 02:16:35.352
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go.

1959
02:16:37.272 --> 02:16:38.939
Back in the back.

1960
02:16:42.152 --> 02:16:43.194
Drive carefully.

1961
02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:45.905
They may be the last passengers
you'll ever carry.

1962
02:16:46.072 --> 02:16:47.573
Funny. That's funny.

1963
02:16:47.741 --> 02:16:48.949
Funny, right? Funny?

1964
02:16:49.117 --> 02:16:51.952
You could be the most
comical cop I ever met.

1965
02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:53.245
Yeah.

1966
02:17:20.649 --> 02:17:22.983
- Culpeper.
- Yes, sir.

1967
02:17:23.610 --> 02:17:25.945
Everything is under control here.

1968
02:17:26.112 --> 02:17:29.198
It'll take a little longer
because there was a joker in the deck...

1969
02:17:29.366 --> 02:17:31.825
...that nobody knew about. All right?

1970
02:17:31.993 --> 02:17:33.535
Yes, sir.

1971
02:17:33.703 --> 02:17:36.872
So don't make a move of any kind
until you hear from me.

1972
02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:38.082
Yes, sir.

1973
02:17:44.923 --> 02:17:48.926
Listen, why does the man
want to give everybody a break?

1974
02:17:49.094 --> 02:17:52.054
- What's his angle there?
- I was wondering about that, too.

1975
02:17:52.222 --> 02:17:55.849
Something funny's going on.
How's he know what we're going to do?

1976
02:17:56.017 --> 02:17:58.477
We're in enough of a mess.
We better do what he said.

1977
02:17:58.645 --> 02:18:01.021
I'm tellin' you,
the man has got some angle.

1978
02:18:01.189 --> 02:18:02.773
Wait, wait. Hold it!

1979
02:18:02.941 --> 02:18:04.233
Can you see him?

1980
02:18:14.286 --> 02:18:17.913
- Just what does he think he's doing?
- That certainly is strange.

1981
02:18:18.081 --> 02:18:20.165
- Sure is.
- What is he doing?

1982
02:18:20.333 --> 02:18:23.544
- He's going the other way.
- Why are we standing here?

1983
02:18:23.712 --> 02:18:26.630
That's it!

1984
02:18:26.798 --> 02:18:29.049
We're off the hook!

1985
02:18:29.718 --> 02:18:32.386
Get out of here! Come on, we're off!

1986
02:18:32.554 --> 02:18:34.221
Come on, get going.

1987
02:18:46.901 --> 02:18:49.737
- Ah!
- Holy mackerel. Almost didn't make it.

1988
02:19:04.836 --> 02:19:07.254
No other cops around. He planned it.

1989
02:19:07.422 --> 02:19:11.300
We found the money and he was waiting
to take it away from us.

1990
02:19:11.468 --> 02:19:15.763
But if we all find the money first
and turn it in, we're all in the clear.

1991
02:19:15.930 --> 02:19:19.099
Let's just get the dough
and worry about the rest later.

1992
02:19:19.267 --> 02:19:22.561
- Look. He's slowing down.
- No, he's turning to the left.

1993
02:20:15.281 --> 02:20:16.990
What's going on?

1994
02:20:17.158 --> 02:20:18.617
Sorry, Jimmy.

1995
02:21:10.503 --> 02:21:12.421
He's heading for the border!

1996
02:21:12.589 --> 02:21:14.590
We should stop
and call the police station!

1997
02:21:14.757 --> 02:21:15.883
You shut up!

1998
02:21:16.050 --> 02:21:18.886
We're going to get that money.
Keep driving!

1999
02:21:19.053 --> 02:21:21.388
That woman is something else.

2000
02:21:21.556 --> 02:21:23.390
Take your foot off the brake!

2001
02:21:23.558 --> 02:21:25.058
Stop hitting me. I'm driving.

2002
02:21:25.226 --> 02:21:28.562
- When you want a cab, you can't get one.
- Yeah, come on, let's go!

2003
02:21:37.572 --> 02:21:39.573
F-14 to Central.

2004
02:21:39.741 --> 02:21:41.158
Come in. What is it?

2005
02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:42.910
There's something phony here.

2006
02:21:43.077 --> 02:21:45.954
We're on 101 by Cortez
checking a mad-dog report.

2007
02:21:46.122 --> 02:21:47.915
Orders were to maintain silence.

2008
02:21:48.082 --> 02:21:50.375
Capt. Culpeper wants
this channel kept clear.

2009
02:21:50.543 --> 02:21:52.252
We know it,
but we saw Capt. Culpeper.

2010
02:21:52.420 --> 02:21:55.464
He just went by doing 90 miles an hour.

2011
02:21:56.341 --> 02:21:58.634
I don't think I understand that.

2012
02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:01.094
Are you sure it was Capt. Culpeper?

2013
02:22:01.262 --> 02:22:03.263
- Yep.
- Was he chasing anybody?

2014
02:22:03.431 --> 02:22:05.974
- Nope.
- Could he have been chasing anybody?

2015
02:22:06.142 --> 02:22:09.186
Not a chance.
That's what struck us so funny.

2016
02:22:09.354 --> 02:22:12.397
There were about 15 people
in two cabs behind him.

2017
02:22:12.565 --> 02:22:14.441
It looked like they were chasing him.

2018
02:22:14.609 --> 02:22:17.694
They were chasing him?
What's going on here?

2019
02:22:17.862 --> 02:22:20.030
I brought it myself.
Everything you asked for.

2020
02:22:20.198 --> 02:22:21.448
- The pension?
- Yeah.

2021
02:22:21.616 --> 02:22:24.034
Call Capt. Culpeper.

2022
02:22:24.202 --> 02:22:27.162
Calling Capt. Culpeper.
Central Division. Urgent.

2023
02:22:27.330 --> 02:22:30.123
Calling Capt. Culpeper.

2024
02:22:38.591 --> 02:22:42.511
- This can only happen in America.
- You going to start that again?

2025
02:23:13.668 --> 02:23:17.045
You've got to believe me.
I'm going to be sick.

2026
02:24:29.702 --> 02:24:32.371
What's the matter?
You trying to kill us?

2027
02:24:32.538 --> 02:24:35.499
Just don't make me nervous!

2028
02:25:09.951 --> 02:25:13.078
- Don't let him get away!
- Cut him off!

2029
02:25:17.917 --> 02:25:21.962
Calling Capt. Culpeper.
Culp, this is Aloysius speaking.

2030
02:25:22.130 --> 02:25:25.632
Now, listen to me, Culp.
Everything has been fixed.

2031
02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:28.468
There's been negotiations
and everything is all right.

2032
02:25:28.636 --> 02:25:31.179
Cut out this nonsense and answer me.

2033
02:25:31.347 --> 02:25:33.348
This is Aloysius speaking.

2034
02:25:43.776 --> 02:25:47.904
I still don't understand this.
What's it all about?

2035
02:25:48.072 --> 02:25:50.449
Um... That's it.

2036
02:25:52.827 --> 02:25:54.369
All units...

2037
02:25:54.537 --> 02:25:56.288
...arrest Capt. Culpeper.

2038
02:25:58.207 --> 02:26:00.333
There he is!

2039
02:26:05.631 --> 02:26:08.383
- Come back!
- Get me out of here!

2040
02:26:08.551 --> 02:26:10.761
Just don't sit there. Come on.

2041
02:26:13.306 --> 02:26:14.431
Come on!

2042
02:26:25.693 --> 02:26:27.527
Stop pushing, will ya?

2043
02:26:27.987 --> 02:26:31.281
Wait. We got him.
Now, you women stay here.

2044
02:26:31.449 --> 02:26:33.325
What do you mean,
"You women stay here"?

2045
02:26:33.493 --> 02:26:35.035
You heard him, mother. Stay here!

2046
02:26:35.203 --> 02:26:36.828
Come on! Let's go!

2047
02:26:52.595 --> 02:26:55.931
- Is he there?
- Where'd he go?

2048
02:26:56.098 --> 02:26:57.599
Halt! Halt!

2049
02:26:57.767 --> 02:26:59.684
Now, wait a minute. Listen.

2050
02:27:08.945 --> 02:27:11.571
Yeah!

2051
02:28:16.637 --> 02:28:19.472
Stop pushing! Get the suitcase.

2052
02:28:21.309 --> 02:28:23.059
Look! Look up there!

2053
02:28:23.227 --> 02:28:25.437
...in this regard,
and there is no doubt...

2054
02:28:26.647 --> 02:28:28.815
Hey! Hey!

2055
02:28:31.819 --> 02:28:33.445
Those ladders are not safe!

2056
02:28:33.613 --> 02:28:36.823
Ladders are not safe!

2057
02:28:42.830 --> 02:28:44.956
Get off!

2058
02:28:45.124 --> 02:28:47.000
- You got it?
- Get it away.

2059
02:28:54.175 --> 02:28:56.134
Get moving!

2060
02:28:56.302 --> 02:28:58.178
Don't push. You got it? That's it.

2061
02:29:04.352 --> 02:29:07.854
Sylvester, what are you doing up there?
You must be out of your mind!

2062
02:29:11.359 --> 02:29:14.235
- Wait a minute!
- Get the suitcase!

2063
02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:20.659
Get that money!

2064
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:43.890
Don't you dare touch any of that money.

2065
02:29:56.529 --> 02:29:59.531
- You! Don't stand there!
- To your right!

2066
02:30:11.335 --> 02:30:12.794
Russell, hang on!

2067
02:30:16.590 --> 02:30:18.466
Dingy, I can't hold on!

2068
02:30:20.594 --> 02:30:21.803
Help us!

2069
02:30:25.391 --> 02:30:27.183
Get off my hand!

2070
02:30:48.122 --> 02:30:49.914
Move onto the ladder!

2071
02:30:51.292 --> 02:30:55.795
Hold on! Wait a minute!
One at a time! Did you hear me?

2072
02:30:55.963 --> 02:30:57.213
One at a time!

2073
02:31:00.301 --> 02:31:01.885
All right!

2074
02:31:02.053 --> 02:31:05.055
All right, you'll see. You'll see.

2075
02:31:06.599 --> 02:31:09.476
Get on alphabetical. I'm Benjy.

2076
02:31:09.643 --> 02:31:12.520
Quit stepping on my head!

2077
02:31:12.688 --> 02:31:16.316
Get on the ladder.

2078
02:31:16.484 --> 02:31:18.818
Don't leave me! Come back here!

2079
02:31:18.986 --> 02:31:20.737
You can't leave me!

2080
02:31:27.119 --> 02:31:29.704
There's too many men
on it to control it.

2081
02:31:58.984 --> 02:32:01.694
Hold it steady. Watch it.
She's whipping loose.

2082
02:32:34.687 --> 02:32:36.271
Ah!

2083
02:32:37.731 --> 02:32:39.232
Whoo!

2084
02:32:41.152 --> 02:32:44.154
Wind us down! Wind us down!

2085
02:32:47.199 --> 02:32:49.576
I don't want the money!

2086
02:32:53.747 --> 02:32:54.956
Look out!

2087
02:33:03.174 --> 02:33:04.424
Get off!

2088
02:33:04.592 --> 02:33:06.593
She's going! Get out of there!

2089
02:33:43.088 --> 02:33:46.132
Emmeline!

2090
02:33:47.218 --> 02:33:49.427
Mama!

2091
02:34:30.094 --> 02:34:32.553
It's all your fault.

2092
02:34:32.721 --> 02:34:35.473
It's your fault from beginning to end.

2093
02:34:35.641 --> 02:34:38.810
You know, even for a policeman...

2094
02:34:38.978 --> 02:34:42.105
...your behavior was ruddy outrageous.

2095
02:34:42.273 --> 02:34:44.899
You could've taken a fair share
like the rest of us...

2096
02:34:45.067 --> 02:34:49.320
...but no, you had to grab up
the whole scene, baby.

2097
02:34:49.488 --> 02:34:54.784
We had $350,000 right in our hands.

2098
02:34:54.952 --> 02:34:58.496
Fourteen into $350,000...

2099
02:34:58.664 --> 02:35:01.040
Shut up.

2100
02:35:03.210 --> 02:35:06.045
I wish I knew what
they were gonna do to us.

2101
02:35:06.213 --> 02:35:11.509
But no matter what happens to us, I hope
what happens to you will be worse.

2102
02:35:13.721 --> 02:35:16.889
I don't think you have to worry
too much about that.

2103
02:35:17.057 --> 02:35:19.017
My wife is divorcing me.

2104
02:35:20.060 --> 02:35:22.812
My mother-in-law
is suing me for damages.

2105
02:35:24.106 --> 02:35:27.734
My daughter is applying to the courts
to have her name changed.

2106
02:35:28.861 --> 02:35:30.903
My pension has been revoked.

2107
02:35:31.071 --> 02:35:34.699
And the only reason
that you 10 idiots...

2108
02:35:35.534 --> 02:35:38.911
...will very likely get off lightly...

2109
02:35:39.079 --> 02:35:43.333
...is because the judge will have
me up there to throw the book at.

2110
02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:45.960
Aw, that's tough. Oh!

2111
02:35:49.757 --> 02:35:54.510
I'd like to think that sometime,
maybe 10 or 20 years from now...

2112
02:35:55.679 --> 02:35:58.890
...there'd be something
I could laugh at, anything.

2113
02:36:08.776 --> 02:36:12.236
Now, see here, you idiots,
it's all your fault because...

2114
02:36:12.404 --> 02:36:14.197
Oh!

2115
02:36:14.365 --> 02:36:18.451
Mama!

2116
02:36:26.293 --> 02:36:28.461
Get away from me!

2117
02:36:28.629 --> 02:36:29.921
Let me go!
