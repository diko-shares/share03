1
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,900
- You suck, Gertrude.
- You suck.

2
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,700
Yeah, I suck so bad I just skunked you.

3
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,600
Which means, you gotta eat your pills.

4
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,100
- You're supposed to be nice to me.
- I am nice to you.

5
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,100
- It's not my fault you got no game.
- You suck, Travis.

6
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,300
I know.

7
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,700
Hey there, Travis.

8
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,900
- I'll check on you later.
- All right.

9
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
<i>Travis,</i>

10
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,000
you've been talking about seeing the world

11
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,500
the whole time you've been here.

12
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,200
Think of it as an opportunity to
finally fulfill that.

13
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,700
- Well, then you're firing me.
- Not firing, laying off.

14
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,900
And I'm not laying you off,
the state is laying you off.

15
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,600
All these budget cuts.

16
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,900
They're clear-cutting the part-time positions.

17
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,400
This has nothing to do with you.

18
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,600
My advice, Travis, go see the world.

19
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,400
Get that out of your system
like you've always wanted.

20
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Maybe you come back,
they may be hiring again.

21
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,500
<i>- Home! Bring them home!
- Home! Bring them home!</i>

22
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,000
- Bring them home!
- Bring them home!

23
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,400
- Bring them home! Bring them home!
- Bring them home! Bring them home!

24
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,800
- Bring them home! Bring them home!
- Bring them home! Bring them home!

25
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,700
- I can't believe they fired me yesterday.
- Come on, man. It was a nursing home.

26
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
- It's a retirement home.
- Yeah, that's what I said. A nursing home.

27
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,200
It's better for the world than insurance.

28
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,400
- Hey, I'm carrying a sign, aren't I?
- Great.

29
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,600
Listen, not to get new-agey or nothing,

30
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,200
but I think this is something that
was supposed to happen to you, you know?

31
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,100
Force you out of your comfort zone,
make you mix it up a little bit.

32
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,000
- I don't need to mix it up, I need to get paid.
- Get innovative then, man.

33
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
Don't tell me you don't know how to do that.

34
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,400
Back in college when you were
doing all that test subject shit.

35
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,200
Selling your sperm.

36
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,700
I never sold my sperm.

37
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,700
'Cause nobody in their right mind
would pay for a piece of those genes.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,300
You know what?

39
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,900
Whoever said peace rallies is
where the action is, doesn't know shit.

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,800
- This is a fucking dyke-fest.
- Not all of them.

41
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,000
No. Not happening.

42
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,100
What's happening?

43
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,800
- Hey. Hey!
- I got friends out there, you son of a bitch!

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,300
- Fucking liberal pussy!
- Enough.

45
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
- Get your fucking hands off me, man.
- Enough! Enough!

46
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,900
Guys like me go over there
and die for a living.

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,900
- Hey!
- Tee off, go ahead.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,700
It's your issue, man. It's your issue, man.
Not mine.

49
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Come on.

50
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,700
- Hypocrite!
- Let's go.

51
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,300
Fucking hypocrite! Go on!
Spread all your lies!

52
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,800
You got a captive audience,
you fucking hippie liberal!

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,200
Go on,
with all your propaganda and diatribes.

54
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,700
Thanks.

55
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,800
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

56
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,900
I'm all right.

57
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,200
<i>My dad sat me down
and had me watch Red Dawn</i>

58
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,900
so that I would understand
just how bad things would get

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
if the Communists took over.

60
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,500
I sort of dug that flick.

61
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,900
Then it was narco-traffickers,
Islamo-Fascists.

62
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,500
Bad guys just keep changing their faces
and we keep going to war.

63
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,000
- And then...
- We keep protesting.

64
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,300
- United we stand.
- Cheers.

65
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,900
This is a big moment, Travis.

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,600
You've just witnessed
the last anti-war diatribe

67
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,900
- the world's ever gonna hear from me.
- Wow.

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,700
You know what I've realized?
Real war's in here.

69
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
You just figured that out?

70
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,500
No, I've known it for a while.

71
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,600
- But I'm finally gonna do something about it.
- And what's that?

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
I'm going to India.

73
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,900
I figure I'll do some yoga,

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,400
some time in an ashram,

75
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,500
have sex with my guru.

76
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,300
We'll both agree afterwards that
it was a mistake, of course.

77
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,000
Of course.

78
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,400
Maybe you should go. We could meet up.

79
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,400
Well, a trip like that
would be a pretty penny,

80
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,000
- which I don't got.
- Could knock over a liquor store.

81
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,100
I think I could come up with something
slightly more legit.

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,400
Such as?

83
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,400
You don't wanna know.

84
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,300
I think I can handle it.

85
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,100
I mean, I think I'm intellectually
limber enough.

86
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,900
Can I see you again?

87
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
- Michael Barris.
- Travis, hey.

88
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,400
- Smart man.
- What?

89
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,900
- You wore a suit. That's a smart move.
- Yeah.

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,600
- I heard there's not many spots.
- Do I need to sign here or print my name?

91
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,600
- Just a signature will do.
- Thanks, boo. Love the jacket.

92
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,000
We are strangers in a strange land, brother.

93
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,000
First off, what we will be doing here,
for those of you that don't know,

94
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,200
will be a behavioral experiment,
in which we will be simulating

95
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,400
the conditions of life
inside a state penitentiary.

96
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,800
Now, our only requirement is that
none of you have ever served any time.

97
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,300
If you have, we'd like to
thank you for your interest,

98
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,000
but you do not fit our profile.

99
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,300
Now, we will be conducting
a short series of tests in a moment,

100
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,500
but before we do
I would just like to take a beat

101
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,900
and let you know that
although the actual experiment

102
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,700
will be conducted
in an utterly secure environment

103
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,800
and the participants will be safe at all times,

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,100
some of the subjects
will be deprived of their civil rights...

105
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,500
It's a flying man... for the entire two weeks.

106
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,800
What's his name?

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,100
- Flying Man.
- Now, let's get to the tests, shall we?

108
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,200
- No history of incarceration?
- No.

109
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,800
- Violence?
- No.

110
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,500
- Never?
- No.

111
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,800
- What about religion?
- No.

112
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,700
No? Religion's not usually
a yes or no question, Mr. Hunt.

113
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,800
People tend to find all sorts of gray areas
in which to couch their answers.

114
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,200
Well, nothing gray here.

115
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,400
So, how do you base
your ethical decisions, then?

116
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Here.

117
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,100
I was in Boy Scouts,
and drill team in high school,

118
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,800
various church groups.

119
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,700
- You were devout, then?
- Still am.

120
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,000
And what about
absolute right and wrong in the universe?

121
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,200
Well, I guess,

122
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,000
if I believe in God,
then I would have to, right?

123
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,500
Yeah, you know, I only got three rules,

124
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,200
eat twat, smoke pot, and smile a lot.

125
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
It's just a short slide-show
we'd like you to watch.

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,300
It's perfectly safe, I assure you.

127
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,200
<i>The sheriff's deputies had escorted
Duceppe back to Baton Rouge.</i>

128
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,400
<i>I am convinced that
when these animals are herded together</i>

129
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,200
<i>their instincts warn them of...</i>

130
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
<i>...California hotel, where FBI agents...</i>

131
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,700
- Are you okay to move on, Mr. Hunt?
- Yep. I'm good.

132
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,100
You wouldn't have hit him.

133
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Who?

134
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,300
The guy at the rally.

135
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,500
You wouldn't have hit him.

136
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,200
These knuckles, they're pristine.

137
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
- You calling me a pussy?
- Yeah.

138
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,500
- It's a compliment.
- Cool.

139
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,700
I'll be gone by the time
you get out, you know.

140
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,000
I know.

141
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,600
Dashashwamedh Ghat, Varanasi.

142
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,100
- Varanasi.
- How soon can you be there?

143
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,300
Twelfth? Thirteenth?

144
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,400
Thirteenth.

145
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,400
Dashashwamedh Ghat on the 13th, 6:00 p. m.

146
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,000
- Hey, you made it.
- Good to see you.

147
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,400
- Yeah.
- I was hoping I'd have someone to talk to.

148
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,900
I can't help but think that
this says something about us.

149
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,600
I think it says we need money.

150
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,200
- Sorry.
- Hey, how's it going?

151
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,600
- It's the beginning.
- Game on.

152
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,000
So let's move on to the topic of women.
What's that word mean to you?

153
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,700
Women? What?

154
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,300
Everything on God's green earth

155
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,000
and possibly beyond what's been
discovered in our universe yet?

156
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
I don't know.

157
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,600
<i>Look, it's only a dog.
So, what're you worried about?</i>

158
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,600
<i>Worried? Who's worried?
I'm only worried about you.</i>

159
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,800
<i>Look, I'll stay here and protect the car,
and you go take a look.</i>

160
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,800
Hey, chickenshit, we got a draft!

161
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,500
Didn't you hear me, chickenshit?

162
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,800
We got a draft. Close the window!

163
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,200
I fell asleep. How far did we drive?

164
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,600
This is a fucking spot.

165
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,900
Gentlemen, they're waiting inside.

166
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,700
You mind if I just grab my bag?
There's some stuff in there that I need.

167
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,000
You'll have everything you need inside.

168
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,700
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

169
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,900
The next two weeks
will be a new experience for you.

170
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,000
Now as I said before,
some of you will have no civil rights.

171
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,600
Do not underestimate that.

172
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,400
If any of you wanna leave,
now is your last chance.

173
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,200
No?

174
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,000
Good.

175
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,400
Again, your safety is
our number one priority.

176
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,500
If there is any violence, any at all,

177
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,000
the experiment
will be immediately terminated.

178
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
Clear?

179
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,500
Now, when I call your name, please stand.

180
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,500
Dernier, Bosch,

181
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,800
Helweg, Sandberg,

182
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,800
Chase, and Barris.

183
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
Good.

184
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,900
So the rest of you,
please stand up and follow the yellow line.

185
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,100
- Later, pal.
- Good luck, gentlemen. And I thank you.

186
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,800
So what do you think, Girl Scouts?
Prisoners or guards?

187
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,900
I think we just got our answer.

188
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,300
Nothing is to come or go from the cell block.

189
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,600
Nothing from the outside world.

190
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,900
If you look in your lockers,
you will see a printout with the five rules

191
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,300
that the prisoners are to follow at all times.

192
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,200
Please read them aloud with me.

193
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,900
"Rule number one:

194
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,500
"Prisoners must eat three meals a day
and all food must be consumed.

195
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,600
"Two: There will be 30 minutes of rec daily.

196
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,800
"Three: Prisoners are allowed only
in prisoner-designated areas.

197
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,900
"Four: Prisoners must speak
only when spoken to.

198
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,700
"And five: Prisoners must not touch
the guards under any circumstances."

199
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Those that break the rules
must be punished commensurately.

200
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,700
What does "commensurate" mean?

201
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,400
This experiment is not about individuals.

202
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,200
If any one person leaves, it's over.

203
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,300
If a prisoner does break the rules,

204
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,900
you will have 30 minutes to choose
proper disciplinary action.

205
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If you fail to do so,
that red light will come on,

206
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,000
the experiment will be terminated,
and you will not get paid.

207
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,600
- What did you say?
- You either maintain strict order,

208
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,900
or you don't get paid.

209
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,700
I will see you in two weeks.

210
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,500
- Sorry, man.
- For what?

211
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
- All this.
- Don't sweat it.

212
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,100
All right, turn around. Gotta do the front.

213
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,400
What? Nobody else had to turn around.

214
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,400
What's the problem, Boy George,

215
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,000
you afraid we gonna see that
you got no dick?

216
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,000
- Fuck you.
- Hey, man. Quit being a fag, huh?

217
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
Maybe if we drop the soap...

218
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,100
All right, girls. Everyone on the line!

219
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,800
- Which one?
- I don't know.

220
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,600
That one. That line.

221
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,600
- How you doing?
- Gotta be honest,

222
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,400
you guys are the most suck-ass guards
I've ever seen.

223
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,400
Yeah, well, you can blow me
and the entire state of Kentucky.

224
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,400
Kentucky?

225
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,300
All right, look, we gotta stop fucking around

226
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,900
or they might end this thing
before it even begins.

227
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,100
I didn't come all the way out here
not to get paid.

228
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,600
"From now on inmates will be addressed
only by their inmate numbers."

229
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,500
That's awesome.

230
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Wow.

231
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,200
The only other thing
that you girls need to know

232
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,600
is, "Prisoners will find cell assignments
attached to each cell."

233
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,000
- Are we supposed to do that?
- Yes, Tinker Bell.

234
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,200
- Now?
- Yes.

235
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,200
Now run along. Run along, find your homes.

236
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,000
- Okay.
- Going.

237
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,200
- Okay, guys...
- This ain't a love-in. Get moving.

238
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,100
Waiting for a bus? Come on!

239
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,600
Hey, Travis.

240
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,700
Seventeen.

241
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,200
Seventy-seven.

242
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,900
Wow, I feel dangerous
just wearing this outfit.

243
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,200
- You look dangerous.
- Oh, yeah.

244
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,200
Yeah, you are massively
messing with me, right?

245
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,700
- No.
- No?

246
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,100
- Benjy Putterman.
- How you doing? Travis.

247
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Novelist.

248
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,500
- Novelist, huh?
- Graphic novelist, actually.

249
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,000
- Comics.
- Graphic novels.

250
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,200
Oh, my God, I'm gonna get so much material
from this place.

251
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,600
- This is ripping!
- Yeah.

252
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,900
Ripping.

253
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,100
So, what drew you to this experiment?

254
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,800
Cash-dollars.

255
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
My mother.

256
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,200
It was her idea?

257
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,500
She broke her hip,

258
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,400
I needed to pay the rent.

259
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,100
Do you live with your mother?

260
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,500
Yes.

261
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,400
And how old are you?

262
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,700
Forty-two.

263
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,900
So, what drew you
to this experiment, Mr. Chase?

264
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Pussy. Pussy drew me to the experiment.

265
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,200
It's a male-only experiment, Mr. Chase.

266
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,600
It's the pussy I'm gonna get
with the 14 grand once I'm done.

267
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,700
How many sexual partners have you had?

268
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,900
I lost track when I was, like, 17.

269
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,700
Were they male or female?

270
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,700
Female.

271
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,300
So, what drew you to
this experiment, Mr. Nix?

272
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,100
I'm just trying to make an honest buck, man.

273
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Escape.

274
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,000
Come on, you big boy.

275
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,000
Throw it down.

276
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
Seventy-seven.

277
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,300
- Flying Man?
- No.

278
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,500
You guys go ahead.

279
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,000
Oh, hell no. These knees are busted.

280
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,000
Hey, how about it, redwood? Throw it down?

281
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,400
- Wait.
- Oh, my God. Is he okay?

282
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,300
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck.

283
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,500
- Bosch, you all right?
- I'm all right.

284
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,100
- Let's get you out of here.
- I thought he was looking.

285
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,300
- Come on.
- I did.

286
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,000
- You all right, big man. You all right.
- It's all right. It was an accident.

287
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,000
It's all right.

288
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,900
What the fuck was that guy thinking, huh?

289
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm okay. I'm okay. He didn't mean it.

290
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,800
- Sure you're all right?
- It's just a bloody nose.

291
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,300
Let's just go back to work. Please.

292
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,200
I don't know.

293
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,800
- I think we gotta do something.
- What are you talking about?

294
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,800
I'm talking about rule number five.

295
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,800
Prisoners are not supposed to touch us.

296
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,100
Well, technically, he didn't touch us.
The ball did.

297
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,200
Look at your face, man.

298
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,100
I mean, we all heard what they said.
We gotta keep the order.

299
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,200
Respond commensurately.

300
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,100
They saw it. They know it was an accident.

301
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,400
- I agree.
- Are you sure about that?

302
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,700
Look, I just don't want that light
to come on in 30 minutes

303
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,700
because we didn't do what
we were supposed to do.

304
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,400
- I got 14 grand on the line.
- Yeah, we all got 14 grand on the line.

305
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,200
Come on.

306
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,900
We're not talking about
crucifying the man here.

307
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,000
The word's commensurate.

308
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,700
Which means,

309
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,300
if what the man did was small potatoes,

310
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
we respond in kind.

311
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,000
Small potatoes for small potatoes.

312
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,000
Either that,

313
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,200
or we wait till that light goes on.

314
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Push-ups, ten.

315
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,000
Do them now.

316
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,500
I just need a little civility, that's all.

317
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,200
It was an accident.

318
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,200
This is not a fucking negotiation.
Do the push-ups.

319
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,100
Just a little civility, brother. Just a little.

320
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,900
All right, everyone, ten push-ups.

321
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,300
You heard the man. Let's go.

322
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,200
Do it! Come on, do it!

323
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,100
Yeah, follow your little brother.

324
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,800
There we are.

325
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Count them out.

326
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,000
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

327
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,000
...four, five, six... four, five, six...

328
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,800
...seven, eight, nine, ten... seven, eight, nine, ten.

329
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,300
What did that tell you, huh?
Tater Tots for Tater Tots.

330
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,400
And you, you ought to be a cop, dude.

331
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,500
- Looked more like a drill sergeant to me.
- Yeah.

332
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,000
<i>Like that guy out of Full Metal Jacket.</i>

333
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,100
- "Give me 20, maggot!"
- Fuck you.

334
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,700
I'm almost embarrassed for them,
to be honest.

335
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,400
You know, stepping and fetching like that.

336
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
Has it been 30 minutes yet?

337
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,300
Just.

338
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,200
I guess we got our verdict.

339
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,500
I'm not mad, you know?

340
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,600
At them.

341
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,500
They keep making us do push-ups like this,
we'll be all swoll.

342
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,500
All of us are.

343
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,700
You know, get paid and get in shape.

344
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,900
- You got a girl, 17?
- No.

345
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
What about you?

346
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,300
- I'm at the start of something.
- Yeah?

347
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Me too. Feels good, doesn't it?

348
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,600
- Good and bad.
- Mine's a barista.

349
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,100
Wouldn't think a guy like me
could pull a barista, would you?

350
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,100
What exactly do you write, anyway?

351
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,700
- Comics.
- Graphic novels.

352
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,500
<i>Yeah, Flying Man's my next big launch.</i>

353
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,800
<i>- Flying Man?
- Yep.</i>

354
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,300
The man who flies.

355
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
- What's he do besides fly?
- See that?

356
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,500
What you just said,
"What else he do besides fly?"

357
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,200
That's how jaded people have become.
We're talking about flying here.

358
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,700
Like a human being, actually flying.

359
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,500
And no cape, nothing.
Just flying, you know?

360
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,700
Like you or me in this cell
just kind of taking off

361
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,500
like nothing could limit us.
Like we could just go, go, go.

362
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,100
Tell me, honestly,
who is not gonna want to read that?

363
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,700
I shouldn't be talking about this anyway.
My agent would kill me if he knew I was.

364
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,000
- You got an agent, huh?
- Yeah, couple.

365
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,300
How you like that, 77?

366
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,800
Looks like we got a heavy hitter
in the box with us.

367
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,600
Yeah, we do.

368
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,800
9:00, ladies! Lights out!

369
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,500
- Really, come on.
- What?

370
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,100
- What is it?
- Move along, fuck-butt.

371
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,700
Yum, yum, come on, people. Move along!

372
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,700
Hey, hey, hey. You gotta clean your plate.

373
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,700
Come on, man. That's not gonna happen.

374
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,500
What are you?
Spokesman for the union now?

375
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,200
Look, nobody's trying to be difficult.

376
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,800
We'll eat everything else, just not that.

377
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,200
I mean, look at it.
It literally might be dog shit.

378
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,500
It's beans. Come on, eat them.

379
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,100
Come on, guys.

380
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,500
It's not like I'm being
unreasonable here, right?

381
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,200
I mean, we got rules, okay?

382
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,500
Rule number one:
You gotta clean your plate.

383
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,200
Rule number six says,
"You gotta eat dog shit."

384
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,600
It's not dog shit.

385
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,800
It's dog shit.

386
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,400
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause you gotta eat it anyway.

387
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,200
Okay, I'm gonna just...
Oh, my God. My dog shit!

388
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
You fucking shit. Out of there.

389
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,900
Look, okay, memo to Adolf,
uniform's not real. Okay, baby?

390
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,300
<i>Hey, Moulin Rouge, you gotta eat it.</i>

391
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Nobody's leaving here
until their plates are clean.

392
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,700
You heard the man, huh?

393
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,700
The word is clean.

394
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,000
- Clean? Is that the word?
- Yeah.

395
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,200
Now it's clean.

396
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,600
He just earned you guys
some more push-ups.

397
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,500
Push-ups. You heard the man! Push-ups!

398
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,000
I'll give you push-ups. Push this up!

399
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,000
Complete wrong move, ass-licker.

400
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,600
Step back!

401
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,200
- You shouldn't have done that!
- Keep it up, girls. Get it out of your system.

402
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,900
That's right, you goose-stepping pussy!

403
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,700
I will see you girls tonight.

404
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,800
Feel the wrath of Flying Man!

405
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,900
Flying Man?

406
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,100
Yeah.

407
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,900
This is our house, bitches!
This is our house!

408
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,100
Only reason,
only fucking reason they did that

409
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,900
was 'cause they knew
they weren't gonna get their asses kicked.

410
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,200
You take away someone's fear
of getting punched in the fucking mouth,

411
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,300
all of a sudden,
they're the biggest cocksuckers

412
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,300
on the fucking planet.

413
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,200
That may be true, but the rules are the rules.

414
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,700
We don't use violence.

415
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,700
Well, we obviously gotta do something.

416
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,300
I mean, we are being tested
just as much as they are.

417
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,600
They made me look like a fucking pussy
is what they did.

418
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,100
Yeah.

419
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,300
I got an idea.

420
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,300
I pledged for a fraternity once.

421
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,300
And during Hell Week, the brothers,

422
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,900
they would break down our will.

423
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,700
They would try to humble us
for the initiation that was gonna come.

424
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,900
I mean, the rules,
they were pretty much the same as here.

425
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,700
I mean, they couldn't hurt us.

426
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,900
But they could do something much worse,

427
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
they could humiliate us.

428
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,900
That's what we have to do.

429
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,600
Is we have to humiliate them.

430
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
What? What are you doing?

431
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,700
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- That is for inciting them.

432
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,100
- What? What are you talking about?
- Shut up.

433
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,300
You need to shut up. All right?

434
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,400
There will be no more incidents

435
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,200
like there was today.

436
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,100
Is that understood?

437
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,400
I said, is that understood?

438
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,500
- Yes.
- Yes.

439
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,700
Yes, what? 'Cause I can't hear you.

440
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,300
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

441
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,600
Who's the bitches now, bitches?

442
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,100
Great job, guys. Great job.

443
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,400
- Dude, I...
- Great job.

444
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,600
- Nice speech.
- Good job, good job.

445
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
I'll catch up later.

446
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,300
Excuse me? Excuse me?

447
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,400
I'm having heat flashes.
I think my blood sugar is low.

448
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Capote, just shut the fuck up, okay?

449
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,800
- What are you talking about, man?
- I'm having low blood sugar.

450
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,400
If I gotta say "Shut the fuck up"
one more time...

451
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,300
You all right?

452
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,000
Okay, everybody's had their fun.

453
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,400
I'm gonna suggest

454
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,900
that we act like gentlemen
for the rest of the way.

455
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,000
That we play by the rules

456
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,500
these last 11 days.

457
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,700
And everybody can go home happily
with their money.

458
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,300
How's that sound?

459
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,500
Where is 51?

460
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,100
Where's 51?

461
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,200
Let's go.

462
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,800
I need sugar.

463
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,000
Look, diabetic.
Says he's diabetic on his application.

464
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,400
So he needs insulin, that's what it is.

465
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,700
No, no, no. Look.
It says he regulates it through diet.

466
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,300
Yeah, man, it's in his own words.

467
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,800
He's the one that filled this out.

468
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,200
This is not a big deal. It's not.

469
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,500
I mean, my fucking grandma
has basically the same thing,

470
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,600
and she just gets moody in between meals.

471
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Trust me, this is not a big deal.

472
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,500
Fifty-one, you need to get up.

473
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
Let's go, come on. Get up.

474
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,400
Hey, I wanna do this.

475
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,800
I do. I just need a Twix bar.

476
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,700
There's one in my bag if you can find it.

477
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,600
Twix bar. Is that what you wanna eat?

478
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,900
Get him up. Get him up. Come on. Come on!

479
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,100
- Are you kidding me?
- You're all right.

480
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,100
- Hey, why don't you let the man be?
- You know the rules, 77.

481
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,000
All prisoners must participate in rec.

482
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,400
And you do not address me
unless I have spoken to you first.

483
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,000
The man... Look at him.

484
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,000
The man can't do it.

485
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,000
You do understand that
this is a prison experiment, right?

486
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,600
Yes.

487
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,600
And you do understand
the roles that we've been given?

488
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
- Obviously.
- You are a prisoner.

489
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,500
You don't give orders, we give orders.

490
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,600
Have I made myself completely clear
to you now?

491
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,000
Let the man lie down.

492
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,800
Do I need to escalate matters right now?

493
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,100
Is that what I should do?

494
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,700
What is that supposed to mean?

495
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,100
It means that you won't shut up.

496
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,800
And I am trying to figure out
how I'm supposed to deal with that.

497
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,600
- Why don't you try being rational?
- How is this for rational?

498
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,000
Do I look rational now? Do I?

499
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,700
- Let's put the sugar in him real quick, man.
- Put it away.

500
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,800
Do I look rational now?

501
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You hit me and the experiment is over.

502
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,700
You know that and I know that.

503
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,500
Easy now, brother. Come on.

504
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,300
Okay. It's okay.

505
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,200
All right, everyone, back in their cell.

506
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,800
Let's go, guards!
Get them back in their cells!

507
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,700
- Let's go.
- Get in!

508
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,500
I don't need an escort.

509
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,700
This ain't right! I ain't playing that shit.

510
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,100
Go. Move!

511
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,400
<i>What do you think they want from us?</i>

512
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,200
Why would you run a prison experiment?

513
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,000
Throw some animals in a cage

514
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,600
and you get to find out which one
of us is gonna be the lions

515
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,600
and which ones are gonna get gut.

516
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,200
I like to think we're slightly higher
on the evolutionary chain than monkeys.

517
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,900
It don't matter how evolved you think we are.

518
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,600
You lock up any animal long enough
and the strong's gonna eat the weak.

519
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,600
That's just the way it is.

520
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,900
You learn that in prison, 17?

521
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,600
- You must think I'm somebody else, slick.
- No.

522
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,900
Just that tattoo you got there is an Aryan tat,

523
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,600
so I figured, you know,
you probably got that in the pen.

524
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,000
Expert in the penitentiary system,
are you, boy?

525
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,600
I just watch a lot of Discovery Channel.

526
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,000
You will not interfere
with my ability to make a paycheck.

527
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,500
You understand?

528
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,200
We're cool. No sweat.

529
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,400
So, what were you in for anyway?

530
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,500
- Did you really just ask me that?
- Yeah. I just asked you that.

531
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,300
- You better pump your brakes, boy.
- Oh, yeah?

532
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,600
- Why's that?
- If you don't start respecting the guards,

533
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,700
you're gonna have a serious problem.

534
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,900
- They're not guards.
- No, they're guards all right.

535
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,800
And them up there,
they're getting exactly what they want.

536
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,500
I suggest you stop protecting your friend.

537
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,800
What's right is right, man.

538
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,900
Last thing a man wants to be in the pen
is right.

539
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,300
Dudes, they...

540
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,300
They start digging in
and getting all righteous then.

541
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,700
That only leads to one place.
Go along to get along, man.

542
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,000
Whatever fire you got in your belly,
you're best to let it go.

543
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,800
Trust me.

544
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,900
Let it go.

545
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,600
<i>All I know</i>

546
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,800
is homie lost his shit back there.

547
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,800
- It was just a show.
- For you, maybe.

548
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,100
- Half those fuckers, they were ready to go.
- They weren't gonna do anything.

549
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,900
How well do you know them?

550
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,000
The assholes outnumber us, for one.

551
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,100
If they wanted to take the advantage,
they could.

552
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,000
Us out here in the middle
of fucking nowhere, we're on our own.

553
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,500
The experimenters,
they wouldn't let anything happen.

554
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,700
How well do you know them?

555
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,600
Seventy-seven, he's the ringleader.

556
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,600
Either way, if it keeps going like this,
someone's gonna throw down.

557
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,900
Look, guys, guys.
If anyone gets hurt, this experiment is over.

558
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,100
None of us will get paid.

559
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,700
Well, we gotta put the clamps on this thing
once and for all then.

560
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,400
What're you thinking?

561
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,800
You wanna know how to reach these guys?

562
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,100
How?

563
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,800
You scare 'em.

564
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,000
Comfortable?

565
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,100
Helweg?

566
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,400
Come on...

567
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,200
The prisoners, they listen to you.

568
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,900
For some reason they look to you
like you're the leader.

569
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,300
I got news for you.

570
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,000
In here,

571
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,700
you're the leader of shit.

572
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,800
This place, it belongs to us.

573
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,000
It belongs to us.

574
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,000
Hey, there are all kinds of things
that we could do to you

575
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,400
to make you hip to that fact.

576
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,700
So, do we have the proper respect

577
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,800
for authority now?

578
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,300
Fuck you, you sick fuck.

579
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,700
This stuff is going right through me.

580
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,800
- Saddle up, gentlemen!
- Fuck!

581
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,800
You want to send a message?

582
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,000
Then send a message. Saddle up.

583
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,500
Saddle up!

584
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,300
What the hell...

585
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,900
You okay?

586
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,400
That was colossally fucked up.

587
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,300
I mean, you are shit-ass nuts,
you know that?

588
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,600
And that's a good thing, Barris.

589
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:47,900
The light, it didn't come on.
They saw it, and it's not coming on.

590
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,700
We did what we did, we sent a message,
but it never leaves this place.

591
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,500
I got something to say.

592
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:03,300
If anything happens like that again,
anything at all,

593
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,600
I'm out of here.

594
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,800
You make a unilateral decision like that,

595
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,900
it could cost the rest of us 100 grand.

596
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,100
I don't care, sir.

597
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,100
Let it go.

598
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,700
Scenario.

599
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,100
Someone harms someone you love.
Rapes them, kills them.

600
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,600
The law fails to prosecute.

601
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,300
This person is free.
There is absolutely nothing you can do.

602
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,100
- Would you consider that justice?
- I don't think on those terms.

603
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,500
Justice is what keeps us safe
as a society. Ordered.

604
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:24,300
Well, justice is... Well, it starts wars.
An eye for an eye for an eye.

605
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,500
It takes a turning of the cheek
for this species to evolve.

606
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,400
So, you're the one who knows
what it's going to take

607
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,400
for the human species to evolve.

608
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,400
Just regurgitating what people
a lot smarter than me have been saying

609
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,200
for a long, long time.

610
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,400
Hey.

611
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,900
Look what I found. Take it.
That ought to boost your blood sugar.

612
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,000
No, it won't.

613
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,100
Yeah, there's a lot of carbohydrates in there.

614
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:35,300
It's like the world's cheapest bread.
It's going to turn to sugar. Trust me.

615
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah, it won't turn to insulin, though.

616
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,300
I thought you didn't need insulin.

617
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,900
Fibbed.

618
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:53,100
If they wouldn't let me bring it down here,
I figured I could tough it out.

619
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,200
Jesus Christ.

620
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,900
- Benjy...
- Fifty-one.

621
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,500
Listen, you can't play around with this.
I got to let them know immediately.

622
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,100
I mean, they need to know.
I got to get you out of here.

623
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,300
No.

624
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You don't understand. You could die.

625
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,700
Not if I get the insulin.

626
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,300
Why are you doing this?

627
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,200
Flying Man is a fraud.

628
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,800
Don't say that.

629
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:34,200
Yeah. It's stupid. It's a stupid, shitty, fat lie.
Just like me.

630
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,600
He's just a man that flies.

631
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:47,100
I need this. I need to stop being a fraud.

632
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I need for once to have something
to show for myself.

633
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,400
Please, 77. Please.

634
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,800
- What the fuck you doing?
- Jesus!

635
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Nothing.

636
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:46,400
- Don't beat your shit off next to me.
- I'm not beating my shit. Fuck off.

637
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,900
I'll give you a thousand of my own money.

638
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,600
He should just go.

639
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:37,200
Listen, man, there's insulin in his bag.
Can you get it?

640
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,000
You know that's not allowed.

641
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,900
I'll give you two. Two thousand.

642
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,000
Two thousand, man. He needs it.

643
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,000
I don't need the money.

644
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,900
Twenty-two. Get up.

645
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,400
Captain wants to see you.

646
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,500
Lucky for us, there's no cameras in here.

647
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,800
What?

648
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
All right, so if we're going to do this,
you can't tell anybody.

649
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,400
The fuck are you talking about?

650
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,900
All I want is a blow job. That's it.

651
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,300
No, no, no, no.

652
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,300
Come on. Just get down on your knees.

653
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,600
Yeah. I'm going to go back to my cell...

654
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,200
First, you get down on your knees, all right?
All right?

655
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,600
I want to go back to my cell.

656
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,400
You will soon enough.
But first you're going to suck my dick.

657
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,000
Suck it yourself.

658
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:50,800
Get down on your knees.
Get down on your fucking knees.

659
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,300
What's going on in here?

660
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Nothing.

661
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,700
What is that prisoner doing out of his cell?

662
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,700
He had something to tell me
about number 77.

663
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,600
He didn't want to say it in front of the others.

664
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,300
- Seventy-seven?
- Yeah.

665
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,300
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

666
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,500
No, I'm asking him. Is that true?

667
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,400
It's true. It's true.

668
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,900
Barris. Thank God I found you.
You got to come quick.

669
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:26,900
See?

670
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,600
Why?

671
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,700
What were you doing back there?

672
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,800
Nothing.

673
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,000
I need you to empty your pockets
for me then.

674
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,300
Empty your pockets, Bosch.
Empty that pocket right there.

675
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:23,500
You know that nothing from the outside
world enters into this cell block.

676
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,400
- You know that, right?
- I mean, I was...

677
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Quiet. Shut up.

678
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,100
They're trying to get you to undermine me.
I know you would never do that.

679
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,000
Who asked you to do that?

680
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,200
You tell me and all will be forgiven.

681
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,000
Who told you?

682
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,300
We need to talk later about this.

683
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,300
Later.

684
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,800
As you can see,

685
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,700
I'm a reasonable man.

686
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,300
I'm not the monster that you
somehow conjured up in your head.

687
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,900
I've been given a position,

688
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,300
didn't ask for it.

689
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,400
In some ways it would've been easier
if I was just a prisoner.

690
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,200
- Like you.
- I doubt that very much.

691
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,300
You broke the rules again, 77.

692
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,000
The guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin...

693
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,500
"The guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin."

694
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,000
"Guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin."

695
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,200
Did you hear that?

696
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,400
A guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin!

697
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,300
Really?

698
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,300
When you speak, can you hear yourself?

699
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,600
What do you think is on
the other side of those cameras?

700
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,400
We are being watched

701
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,900
24 hours a day by people
who know what they are doing.

702
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:07,700
Do you think that if there was even a chance,
just the littlest bit of a chance,

703
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,200
that somebody'd die,
that they would let it happen?

704
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,700
He's perfectly safe, your friend.

705
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:21,600
They will keep him perfectly safe.

706
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,300
When this is over,
you know what you ought to do?

707
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,800
No.

708
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,200
You ought to take this money,

709
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,500
take a little time off
from whatever it is that you do.

710
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,500
Check into a nice, clean mental facility

711
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,700
where experts can properly diagnose
what exactly is wrong with you.

712
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,400
Maybe you could suggest to me
a mental facility,

713
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,500
because obviously you're running around
in a mental facility inside of your head.

714
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,600
You're letting this guy
fucking run the show?

715
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,000
You're still not following the rules.

716
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,900
- You need help.
- Still arguing about the rules.

717
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,300
I'm not trying to instigate anything.
You need to get help, okay?

718
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,100
You need some fucking help.

719
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,700
You know what I need?

720
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,800
I need you to clean that toilet.

721
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:20,300
- That's what I need.
- Enough. Enough of this shit, man.

722
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,400
Toilet! It's not cleaning itself.

723
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,500
Let's just stop this, all right, guys?
Let's stop.

724
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,200
You're in charge.
Does that make you happy?

725
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:34,100
Toilet! I need you to clean my toilet!

726
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,700
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

727
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,600
Fuck. You.

728
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:44,600
I don't normally like to use profanity,
but fuck you!

729
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,900
Fuck...

730
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,200
You are a prisoner, 77.

731
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,600
But your pride is getting in the way.

732
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,800
I think I need you to say it for me.

733
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,700
Say, "I am a prisoner."

734
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,500
Fuck you.

735
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,700
Say it.

736
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,000
Fuck...

737
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,900
Say it.

738
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,400
Go to hell.

739
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,400
Stop it, please.

740
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,400
Then say it for me.

741
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:23,300
I...

742
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,900
I am...

743
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:32,600
A prisoner. A prisoner.

744
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,600
A prisoner. I am a prisoner.

745
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:42,600
Yes. Yes. Yes, 77.

746
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:48,400
That is exactly what you are.

747
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,900
Hey. Talk to you for a minute?

748
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,800
Come on.

749
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,400
Let's go.

750
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:14,400
- How come we can't talk back in the room?
- Some of the guys just wouldn't wait.

751
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,700
Whatever you guys are going to do,
please don't do it.

752
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:59,300
I think it's pretty clear by now there will be
a zero tolerance for breaking the rules.

753
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:13,400
Bosch will be joining the prison population.

754
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:18,300
He will be referred to now as Prisoner 76.

755
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,300
Is there a problem with that, Prisoner 77?

756
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,700
Good.

757
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,900
I am an equitable man. Equitable. Equitable.

758
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:43,100
<i>Not once, not once can you accuse me</i>

759
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,600
<i>of breaking the rules.</i>

760
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,300
<i>The rules, they help us
because they guide us...</i>

761
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,800
<i>So that we can exist. So that we can exist.</i>

762
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,200
Exist in this world.

763
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,200
Everybody's not happy with their lot in life.

764
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,600
They have a position, he has a position,

765
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:10,800
and all of you, all of you,
you have your positions.

766
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:17,400
And I, I have a position.
Without the rules, there's chaos.

767
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,700
Put that back on.

768
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,100
I said, put that back on, 77.

769
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,000
Did you hear me, 77?

770
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:55,000
Put it back on! You put that back on.
You get back in the line.

771
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:59,500
Don't take another step. What're you doing?
Just let him go by? Stop him!

772
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,700
Open the gate. You in there.

773
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:04,900
- We're done.
- Seventy-seven.

774
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,100
You hear me? We're done.

775
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,000
We're done.

776
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,600
Nobody speaks to them, do you hear me?
Nobody.

777
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,700
Nobody can speak to them.
You don't say one single word to them!

778
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:26,100
That's rule number one now.
Nobody speaks to them!

779
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,800
That's my friend!

780
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,000
You fucking lowlife! You piece of shit!

781
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,200
You couldn't just shut the fuck up,
could you?

782
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,500
You brought this on your fucking self!

783
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,400
Fuck you!

784
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,000
Divide the prisoners up.
Isolate them so they can't communicate.

785
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,600
The only strength in numbers
I want inside this place is ours.

786
01:14:56,900 --> 01:15:03,100
How the fuck can you listen to that shit?
I can't even fucking think.

787
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,500
All I know is I'm out of here.

788
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,000
You do know that any decisions we make,

789
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,100
we make together?

790
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,400
Well, this thing's over.

791
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,100
We used violence
and the experiment's done.

792
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:17,300
Is it? It's been a lot longer than half an hour
and red light hasn't come on yet.

793
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,600
So fucking what?

794
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,600
If you think about this rationally,
it was the prisoners who did the violence.

795
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,800
We just responded commensurately.

796
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,600
Fuck commensurately.
And fuck that fucking red light!

797
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,400
How can you say that?

798
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,500
The red light,
that's the only thing that we have!

799
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:35,700
Don't you realize that?

800
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,300
It's the only way that we can know.

801
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,500
Where's my music?

802
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,700
You can feel what's happening, right?

803
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,700
You're fucking crazy. You know that?

804
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,000
Can you feel it?

805
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:51,500
What? Camera? Camera.

806
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,700
Why? Why would you have...

807
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,900
Why don't you stop this? Why?

808
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:34,500
I'll fucking kill you. Kill. I'll fucking kill you.

809
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I'm going to take that tape off of you.

810
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:02,100
And you're going to give me what I want.
Okay?

811
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,700
Fuck you.

812
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,800
You're a fucking faggot. You know that.

813
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:21,000
Aren't you afraid? Yeah. Yeah.

814
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,100
I know you.

815
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:46,000
You didn't think I would see?
You didn't think I was smart enough?

816
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,600
Please don't hit me again.

817
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,700
Hey, I was going to try to be nice.

818
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,500
Fucking kill you.

819
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,800
Please.

820
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,900
You know, if your mouth
doesn't want to play nice,

821
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,100
we'll just have to use the other end.

822
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,000
No. No, no, please. Wait, wait. Time out.

823
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:52,400
- Shut up!
- Time out, time out.

824
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,000
No. Please don't do this.

825
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,300
Hi.

826
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,700
Go to sleep, motherfucker, go to sleep.

827
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,800
You think fags are funny?
Who's funny now?

828
01:20:54,700 --> 01:21:00,500
- Hey, kid. You all right?
- No. Thank you. Thank you.

829
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,000
You still want to go along and get along?

830
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,700
Fuck no.

831
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,700
These boys must think I'm somebody else.

832
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,200
Everybody's out, man.

833
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,600
Hey, buddy. Hey, man.

834
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:09,300
No, no, no. Come on.

835
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,900
Barris, we got trouble.

836
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:34,300
Coming for you!

837
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,800
Jesus.

838
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,600
Jesus. What'll we do?

839
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,200
We get ready.

840
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:14,000
You're fucking losing it, man.
They outnumber us two to one.

841
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:26,300
Maybe, but they're still prisoners.
And they're still scared of us.

842
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,900
We're the authority here.

843
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,500
Does that look like they give a fuck?

844
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,100
Fuck your authority.

845
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,900
About fucking time.

846
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:33,300
What're you doing? What are you doing?
We got to stand and fight!

847
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:37,200
This is our world!
You cannot take it from us! No!

848
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,600
Why are you doing this?

849
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,100
We're still guards! Guards!

850
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,600
This is your fault!

851
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:46,900
You still think we're higher
on the evolutionary chain than monkeys?

852
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,500
Yeah.

853
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:02,100
'Cause we can still do something about it.
