0
00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.251
Wrong, as usual.

1
00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.552
The United States' lack of action
in Eastern Europe...

2
00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:33.165
...proves that the Soviet Union's aggression
at the Afghan border...

3
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.494
...will not be opposed publicly
by the United States.

4
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:43.873
lssue: The Soviet Union continued
its recent series of military exercises...

5
00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:47.274
...conducting a bomb test today
in the Bering Sea...

6
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.416
...just 1,500 miles
off the southern coast of Alaska.

7
00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:55.987
President Richard Nixon
issued this warning to the Soviets:

8
00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:59.580
The United States does not start fights.

9
00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:03.422
Let it be clear we maintain our strength...

10
00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.361
...in order to maintain peace...

11
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.264
...so any adversary
should ask themselves:

12
00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:13.531
"Do the consequences
of attacking America...

13
00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:16.335
...outweigh the potential benefits?"

14
00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.138
As a result of the Soviet activity...

15
00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.077
...the watchdog group
of nuclear scientists...

16
00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:27.686
...moved the Doomsday Clock
up to five minutes until midnight:

17
00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:32.154
destruction by nuclear war.

18
00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.554
Question:

19
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.352
on a scale of <i>z</i>ero to ten,
<i>z</i>ero meaning impossibility...

20
00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.862
...ten meaning
complete metaphysical certitude...

21
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:44.560
...what are the chances the Russians
will actually attack the United States?

22
00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.001
Pat Buchanan.

23
00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.503
Zero.

24
00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.302
The Soviets
would never risk going to war...

25
00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:54.311
...when we have a walking nuclear deterrent
on our side.

26
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.972
You're referring, of course,
to Dr. Manhattan...

27
00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:01.142
...but does Dr. Manhattan's existence
guarantee world peace? Eleanor Clift.

28
00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:04.118
Well, it hasn't
stopped the Soviet Union...

29
00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:08.921
...from stockpiling record amounts
of nuclear weapons.

30
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.824
You don't think it's just posturing?

31
00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.556
Maybe the reason
why the Soviets...

32
00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.257
...are doing these bomb tests...

33
00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:19.838
...is because they feel threatened
by Dr. Manhattan. of course.

34
00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:23.536
Maybe the whole world feels like that.

35
00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.979
Soviet ships have violated
the territorial waters-

36
00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:07.012
Just a matter of time, I suppose.

37
00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:41.340
lt's a joke. lt's all a joke.

38
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:44.245
Mother, forgive me.

39
00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:47.993
l was a hero, goddamn it!

40
00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:53.558
...an act clearly meant to send
a signal to the government in Saigon...

41
00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:58.067
...that violence and oppression
is not the way to peace.

42
00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.899
Fuck you, pigs!

43
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.168
Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.

44
00:10:57.123 --> 00:11:00.183
Get out of here, vigilantes!

45
00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:10.028
No!

46
00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:43.162
Edward Blake. Sixty-seven
years old. Six-two, a solid 225.

47
00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.500
Guy was built like a linebacker.

48
00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:47.571
Yeah, I saw the body.

49
00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:49.798
For a guy his age,
he was in terrific shape.

50
00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:52.671
You mean apart from being dead?

51
00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.369
That's plate glass.

52
00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:58.482
You'd have to step on the gas
just to put a crack in it.

53
00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:00.618
Had to have been thrown.

54
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.014
Check the bedroom?

55
00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:05.122
Yeah. Drawers opened, tossed through.

56
00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:08.350
Mattress flipped. Probably robbery.

57
00:12:08.527 --> 00:12:10.017
or made to look like one.

58
00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:11.925
See this?

59
00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:15.462
- Shaking hands with the president.
Whoa.

60
00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.864
Think Blake was a spook?

61
00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:21.734
Government or black ops?

62
00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:23.941
l think...

63
00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:27.542
...this is way bigger than both of us.

64
00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:35.951
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

65
00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:41.252
Dog carcass in alley this morning.
Tire tread on burst stomach.

66
00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:43.758
This city's afraid of me.

67
00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:47.855
l've seen its true face.
The streets are extended gutters...

68
00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:50.901
...and the gutters are full of blood.

69
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.561
And when the drains finally scab over...

70
00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.871
...all the vermin will drown.

71
00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:59.876
The accumulated filth of all their sex
and murder...

72
00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.309
...will foam up around their waists...

73
00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:07.909
...and all the whores and politicians
will look up and shout, "Save us."

74
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:12.550
And l'll whisper, "No."

75
00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.926
Now the whole world
stands on the brink...

76
00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:19.620
...staring down into bloody hell.

77
00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:23.326
All those liberals and intellectuals...

78
00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.460
...and smooth talkers...

79
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:29.130
...and all of a sudden,
nobody can think of anything to say.

80
00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:32.438
Beneath me, this awful city.

81
00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:36.376
lt screams like an abattoir
full of retarded children...

82
00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:41.178
...and the night reeks of fornication
and bad consciences.

83
00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:05.898
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.

84
00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:07.403
Somebody knows why.

85
00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.604
Somebody knows.

86
00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:17.612
lt all started with the gangs.
You know, people tend to forget that.

87
00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:21.343
Pirate outfits, ghosts.

88
00:15:21.553 --> 00:15:24.113
They thought it was funny:
dress up and pull heists.

89
00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:28.554
As soon as we'd arrest them,
they'd be back on the street.

90
00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:32.561
Nobody could pick them out of a lineup
because of the damn masks.

91
00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:35.029
So a few of us cops, we get together...

92
00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:38.534
...and we figure, what the heck,
we'll mask up, too.

93
00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:41.433
We'll finish what the law couldn't.

94
00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:46.234
Pretty soon, the papers get wind of it.
They ran with it...

95
00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:50.074
...and Oh, boy, we're a national pastime.

96
00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:53.740
lt was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman...

97
00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:57.354
...Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice...

98
00:15:57.489 --> 00:16:00.617
...Silk Spectre and the Comedian.

99
00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:04.320
Oh, don't get me started on him.

100
00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:10.525
l must be drunk already,
telling you this sob story again.

101
00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:12.603
l think you were trying to make a point.

102
00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:19.637
Well, my point is that we had it too easy.
lt wasn't fair what happened to you guys-

103
00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:23.942
You guys who picked up where we left off.
- with Nixon forcing you out.

104
00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:29.454
Nixon, Oh, that prick. To think I voted
for that prick five times.

105
00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:32.419
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?

106
00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:39.027
Oh, wow, it's almost midnight.
Gotta go.

107
00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:42.159
Truth?

108
00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:46.566
You were a better Nite owl
than I ever was, Danny boy.

109
00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:50.470
- Hollis, we both know that's bullshit.
- Hey.

110
00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:51.939
Watch it with the language.

111
00:16:52.077 --> 00:16:54.739
This is the left hook
that floored Captain Axis, remember?

112
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.938
Yeah.

113
00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:58.641
Next week?
HoLLlS: Well...

114
00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:03.379
...you know, you don't have to
keep humoring me like this.

115
00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:05.716
lf you got a hot date or something...

116
00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:08.689
Hey, us retired guys
have to stick together, right?

117
00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:12.327
You ever miss it?

118
00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.625
No. You?

119
00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:17.998
Oh, heck, no.

120
00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.101
Be seeing you.

121
00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.398
Hello, Daniel.

122
00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.195
Rorschach.

123
00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:30.605
Helped myself to some beans.
Hope you don't mind.

124
00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:33.210
No, no. Course not.

125
00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:37.338
You want me to heat those up for you?

126
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:39.039
Fine like this.

127
00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:41.812
How have you been keeping?

128
00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:48.022
Out of prison.

129
00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:50.017
So far.

130
00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.123
Daniel...

131
00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:54.254
...look at this.

132
00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:04.067
ls this bean juice?
RoRSCHACH: Human bean juice.

133
00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:09.270
Badge belonged to the Comedian.
Blood too. He's dead.

134
00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:12.783
Let's talk downstairs.

135
00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:15.314
lt could have been a burglary.

136
00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:18.217
Maybe the killer didn't know
who the Comedian was.

137
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:23.123
An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.

138
00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:28.132
l heard he'd been working
for the government since '77...

139
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.497
...knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

140
00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:34.606
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

141
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.002
Maybe.

142
00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:39.439
Maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

143
00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:41.704
You don't think that's a little paranoid?

144
00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:44.439
That what they say about me now?

145
00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:45.944
Paranoid?

146
00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:49.018
Look, Comedian made
a lot of enemies over the years...

147
00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:50.621
...even among his friends.

148
00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:53.017
Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

149
00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:57.818
He wrote that book. Said some bad things
about the Comedian in it.

150
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:02.057
l don't like what you're implying,
and I like being followed even less.

151
00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:07.071
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someone's gunning for masks.

152
00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:11.938
- You were never that sentimental.
- Attack on one is attack on all of us.

153
00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:14.778
What do you suggest we do about it?

154
00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:16.841
Retribution.

155
00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:21.582
- Watchmen are over.
- Says Tricky Dick.

156
00:20:21.753 --> 00:20:23.550
Says me.

157
00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:27.750
Nobody knows who you are.

158
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.895
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

159
00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:34.965
That what you have now?
A normal life?

160
00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:39.369
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies...

161
00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:40.971
...past the human cockroaches...

162
00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:43.903
...talking about their heroin
and child pornography...

163
00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:45.600
...do you really feel normal?

164
00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:49.508
Least l'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

165
00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:52.678
No.

166
00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:56.479
You're hiding in plain sight.

167
00:20:57.889 --> 00:21:00.016
Be seeing you, Dan.

168
00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.927
A maintenance hatch
will let you out two blocks north.

169
00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:04.823
Yeah, I remember.

170
00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:09.057
Came here often,
when we were partners.

171
00:21:09.234 --> 00:21:11.134
Those were great times, huh,
Rorschach?

172
00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:14.868
- What happened?
- You quit.

173
00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.156
Mr. Veidt...

174
00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:46.096
...to date,
you're one of only two Watchmen...

175
00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:48.705
...ever to reveal their true identity
to the world...

176
00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:50.808
...the first being Hollis Mason.

177
00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:53.968
And you've certainly profited greatly
by it...

178
00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:59.412
...turning your superhero alter ego,
o<i>z</i>ymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

179
00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:02.610
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

180
00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:04.812
l understand there's a movie
in the works.

181
00:22:05.023 --> 00:22:09.221
- l'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth.
RoTH: l'm sorry. Do you think-

182
00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:11.953
The Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

183
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.860
lt's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind...

184
00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:18.059
...some of my old colleagues
might see it that way...

185
00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:21.228
...just as you're clearly aware
that biased journalism...

186
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.034
...sells more maga<i>z</i>ines.

187
00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:29.276
The merchandising arm of Veidt lndustries
is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

188
00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:32.440
We recently expanded our research facility
in Antarctica...

189
00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:35.781
...in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy...

190
00:22:35.987 --> 00:22:38.956
...that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

191
00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:41.591
Now, it doesn't take
a political scientist...

192
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.161
...to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological...

193
00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:48.856
...it's based upon fear.
Fear of not having enough.

194
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:52.898
But if we make resources infinite...

195
00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:57.467
...we make war obsolete.

196
00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:02.042
l would hope the other Watchmen
understand that...

197
00:23:03.248 --> 00:23:04.909
...wherever they may be.

198
00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.417
Thanks for your time.

199
00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:17.321
- You look good, Adrian.
- Dan.

200
00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:19.724
lt's been too long.

201
00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:25.527
So Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

202
00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:28.069
You think it's possible?

203
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.970
Statistically, one murder
doesn't equal a trend.

204
00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:34.078
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

205
00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:38.079
And so was the Comedian.
He was practically a Na<i>z</i>i.

206
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.941
You know that better than anyone.

207
00:23:41.153 --> 00:23:43.348
l'm not here because I miss him.

208
00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:44.852
lt's occurred to Rorschach...

209
00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:47.991
...that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

210
00:23:48.493 --> 00:23:50.586
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

211
00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:53.854
That's why l'm warning you first.

212
00:23:57.469 --> 00:23:59.460
Thank you, Dan...

213
00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:04.806
...but I fear there's something
much more real to worry about...

214
00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:07.537
...than Rorschach's mask killer.

215
00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:13.609
lf the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

216
00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:17.414
The Soviets have 51,000
warheads stockpiled.

217
00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:20.819
Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

218
00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:25.157
...the one percent that get through
could still kill every living thing on Earth.

219
00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:30.265
Even Dr. Manhattan
can't be everywhere at once.

220
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:50.146
Rorschach's journal,
October 13th, 1985...

221
00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:52.687
...8:30 p. m.

222
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:57.293
Meeting with Dreiberg
left bad taste in mouth.

223
00:24:57.496 --> 00:25:01.489
A flabby failure who sits
whimpering in his basement.

224
00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:05.636
Why are so few of us left active...

225
00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:10.707
...healthy and without
personality disorders?

226
00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:14.107
The first Nite Owl
runs an auto-repair shop.

227
00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:17.647
The first Silk Spectre
is a bloated, aging whore...

228
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:20.716
...dying in a California rest resort.

229
00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:23.444
Dollar Bill got his cape stuck
in a revolving door...

230
00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:25.145
...where he got gunned down.

231
00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:28.224
Silhouette, murdered...

232
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.529
...a victim of her own indecent lifestyle.

233
00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:35.055
Mothman's in an asylum in Maine.

234
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.233
Only two names remain on my list.

235
00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:47.471
Both share private quarters
at Rockefeller Military Research Center.

236
00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:49.978
l shall go to them.

237
00:25:50.348 --> 00:25:55.786
l shall go tell the indestructible man
that someone plans to murder him.

238
00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:05.292
Good evening, Rorschach.

239
00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:08.989
Dr. Manhattan, you know why l'm here.

240
00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:10.601
Yes...

241
00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:13.804
...but you're going to leave disappointed.

242
00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:17.702
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

243
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:20.104
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

244
00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:22.304
l have a real name l've been using.

245
00:26:22.514 --> 00:26:23.503
Try it.

246
00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:25.808
Whatever you say, Laurie.

247
00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:27.211
What are you doing here?

248
00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:29.717
The Comedian is dead.

249
00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:31.946
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

250
00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:34.815
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

251
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.054
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

252
00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:43.131
Even if I wanted to help...

253
00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:47.637
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

254
00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:52.135
- I cannot see it clearly.
- lnterference? Caused by what?

255
00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:55.678
ln all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

256
00:26:56.448 --> 00:27:00.475
lf the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

257
00:27:00.685 --> 00:27:04.621
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

258
00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:09.783
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

259
00:27:10.428 --> 00:27:13.795
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

260
00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:15.998
l must return to my work.

261
00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:17.294
Wait a minute.

262
00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:19.926
What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

263
00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:22.335
So we can't do anything to stop it?

264
00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:24.338
Goodbye, Rorschach.

265
00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:26.807
Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

266
00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.310
l'm not leaving-

267
00:27:29.547 --> 00:27:31.913
- till l've had my say.

268
00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:42.359
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days.

269
00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:45.223
l didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

270
00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:49.826
lf Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis,
war may be averted.

271
00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:52.060
But you always say time is simultaneous.

272
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:55.638
lf that's true,
then how can you change the future?

273
00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.777
lf only you could perceive time as I do.

274
00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:02.174
Please let me show you.

275
00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:13.123
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
l was a hero, goddamn it!

276
00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:16.385
lt's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

277
00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:18.996
l'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

278
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.894
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

279
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.230
- lt was a mistake. one time.
- Man tries to rape you-

280
00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:27.903
Stop!

281
00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:30.140
Your mind goes to dark places...

282
00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:32.640
...and you wonder
why I keep the worst from you.

283
00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:40.050
- Say hello to Dan for me.
- What?

284
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.618
You wanna ask me
to go to dinner with you...

285
00:28:46.324 --> 00:28:48.519
...like we used to...

286
00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:51.054
...but you won't.

287
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.128
You know I can't.

288
00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:59.033
So you'll call Dan...

289
00:28:59.437 --> 00:29:01.564
...which is only natural.

290
00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:04.500
You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

291
00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:40.401
Dan Dreiberg's table.

292
00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:05.332
Did you know that
he and H.J. were? I had no idea.

293
00:30:05.837 --> 00:30:08.931
You remember that cra<i>z</i>y guy?
What'd he call himself?

294
00:30:09.073 --> 00:30:10.563
Captain Carnage.

295
00:30:10.742 --> 00:30:13.939
Used to pretend he was a supervillain
just so he could get beat up?

296
00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:16.545
Yeah, he tried that on me once.
l just walked away.

297
00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:19.741
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight...

298
00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:22.681
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!"

299
00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:25.445
l'm just saying, "No, get lost."

300
00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:29.092
God, whatever happened to him?

301
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.455
Oh. Um...
He pulled that on Rorschach...

302
00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:33.996
...and Rorschach
dropped him down an elevator shaft.

303
00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:42.871
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.

304
00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:46.066
- lt's a little funny.
- Yep.

305
00:30:47.979 --> 00:30:49.970
WoMAN: l'm glad I ordered
the four-legged chicken.

306
00:30:50.114 --> 00:30:52.105
lt's really good to see you again.

307
00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:54.874
lt's great seeing you too.

308
00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:58.178
Why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?

309
00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.621
- No one else would.
- Yeah, but do you remember my costume?

310
00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:05.921
All that tight latex?
l mean, it was awful.

311
00:31:06.064 --> 00:31:09.033
Uh... Yeah, yeah, awful.

312
00:31:09.234 --> 00:31:11.634
But didn't wanna disappoint Mother.

313
00:31:11.836 --> 00:31:15.829
Wanted her little girl to be just like her
and fight bad guys.

314
00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:20.069
l think the Keene Act was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

315
00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:23.545
Well, we'll live longer anyway.

316
00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:28.341
What?

317
00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:33.848
Jon thinks, unless he can do something
about it...

318
00:31:34.692 --> 00:31:36.751
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.

319
00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:38.685
Soon.

320
00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:42.897
But I don't know what to think.
l mean, it's all...

321
00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:46.161
...quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.

322
00:31:46.304 --> 00:31:49.068
l never even know
what universe he's actually seeing.

323
00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:53.503
He just keeps getting further away
from me.

324
00:31:54.212 --> 00:31:55.873
Everyone.

325
00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:59.677
l can't even tell
if he actually cares about me anymore...

326
00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:01.818
...or if he's just pretending.

327
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.455
lf he's pretending, it means he cares.

328
00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:12.219
Hold on, l'll get the door.

329
00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:15.328
Thanks, Dan.

330
00:32:15.733 --> 00:32:17.724
- Got it?
- Yeah.

331
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.768
l'm sorry.

332
00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:27.844
l invite you out to dinner to catch up
and have a few laughs...

333
00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:31.579
...but there don't seem to be many laughs
around these days.

334
00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:35.583
What do you expect?
The Comedian's dead.

335
00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:10.738
Laurie? ls that you?

336
00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:16.453
Thought you'd be used
to traveling that way by now.

337
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:21.114
Well, l'm not.
l hate it when Jon teleports me.

338
00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:24.158
Well, it beats flying coach.

339
00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.520
Margarita?

340
00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:28.925
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

341
00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:36.069
Remember that guy
that writes me letters?

342
00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:39.740
He sent me an item of memorabilia.
lt's a Tijuana bible.

343
00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:44.075
This little eight-page porno comic
they did in the '30s and '40s.

344
00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:48.275
- He sent you this?
- Sure. They're very valuable, like antiques.

345
00:34:49.153 --> 00:34:50.780
Mother, this is gross.

346
00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:53.252
l think it's kind of flattering.

347
00:34:53.424 --> 00:34:55.688
Why do you always call me Mother
when you're mad?

348
00:34:57.061 --> 00:35:01.088
l know why you're here.
l can still read, you know.

349
00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:04.097
l saw it in the paper.

350
00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:07.636
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.

351
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.432
Finally got his punchline, I guess.

352
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.743
- Poor Eddie.
- Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?

353
00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:18.005
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.

354
00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:20.716
You don't know.

355
00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:22.614
Things change.

356
00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:26.251
What happened happened 40 years ago.

357
00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:29.723
l'm 67 years old.

358
00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:34.059
Every day, the future
looks a little bit darker.

359
00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:37.060
But the past...

360
00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:40.560
...even the grimy parts of it...

361
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:43.733
...keep on getting brighter.

362
00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:52.080
l've got spots in my eyes.

363
00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:58.248
Stop it, Eddie.

364
00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:02.522
- Thank you, Weegee.
- Thank you, Mr. owl.

365
00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:06.925
Tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.

366
00:36:07.098 --> 00:36:10.295
- Little place on 21st.
- Sounds good.

367
00:36:10.434 --> 00:36:15.030
Wow, a real photo session.
Wonder how my hair will look?

368
00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:20.538
Oh, go ahead. l'll be there in five.

369
00:36:37.061 --> 00:36:38.119
Eddie.

370
00:36:39.163 --> 00:36:43.224
What the hell are you doing here?
You knew I was changing.

371
00:36:43.434 --> 00:36:45.026
Sure I did.

372
00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:48.229
Come on, baby.

373
00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:50.664
l know what you need.

374
00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:54.937
You gotta have some kind of reason
for dressing in an outfit like this.

375
00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:57.377
l said no, Eddie.

376
00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:02.884
- No spelled Y-E-S.
- No spelled N-o.

377
00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:06.488
- All right?
- Come on, sweetheart.

378
00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:12.020
Eddie...

379
00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:52.630
You little bastard.

380
00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:00.210
This what you like?

381
00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:02.869
- This what makes you hot?
- What?

382
00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:16.588
Things are tough all over, cupcake.

383
00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:20.890
lt rains on the just and the unjust alike.

384
00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:24.900
The Comedian was a little bit of both.

385
00:38:26.337 --> 00:38:29.704
And he always thought
he'd get the last laugh.

386
00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:33.301
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

387
00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:37.244
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers...

388
00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:42.011
...but spare us, Lord most holy,
o God most mighty...

389
00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:45.245
...o holy and merciful savior.

390
00:38:45.956 --> 00:38:48.720
Thou most worthy judge eternal.

391
00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:52.226
Suffer us not at our last hour
for any-

392
00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.220
Fireworks. You gotta be kidding me.

393
00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:57.122
You know, you'd think this goddamn
country had had enough fireworks.

394
00:39:58.028 --> 00:40:00.622
You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam...

395
00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:05.768
...l think it might have driven us cra<i>z</i>y.
You know, as a country.

396
00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:10.234
But we didn't, thanks to you.

397
00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:14.143
You sound bitter.

398
00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:15.972
Me? Bitter?

399
00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:19.241
Fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.

400
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:27.454
Oh, Jesus Christ.

401
00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:30.583
- Mr. Eddie?
- Just what I fucking needed.

402
00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:35.858
The war is over now.
We must talk about this baby.

403
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.161
There's nothing to talk about.
See, l'm leaving.

404
00:40:40.304 --> 00:40:41.669
l'm gonna forget about you...

405
00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:44.673
...and your horrible, sweaty,
little piece-of-shit country.

406
00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:46.369
Get the fuck out of here.

407
00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:49.977
- No.
- Get the fuck out of here.

408
00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:51.512
You will remember.

409
00:40:53.317 --> 00:40:56.013
You will remember me and my country...

410
00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:58.513
...forever!

411
00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:02.956
My face!

412
00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:06.322
Blake. Don't.

413
00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:08.428
Blake!

414
00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:17.830
She was pregnant...

415
00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:20.839
...and you gunned her down.

416
00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:22.240
That's right...

417
00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:24.346
...and you know what? You watched me.

418
00:41:24.548 --> 00:41:27.540
You could have turned the gun to steam,
the bullets to mercury...

419
00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:31.278
...the bottle into goddamn snowflakes,
but you didn't, did you?

420
00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:36.090
You really don't give a damn
about human beings.

421
00:41:37.261 --> 00:41:40.094
You're drifting out of touch, Doc.

422
00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:43.860
God help us all.

423
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.167
Medic!

424
00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:57.174
Most holy and merciful savior.

425
00:41:58.115 --> 00:42:02.313
He cometh up and is cut down,
like a flower.

426
00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:07.351
ln the midst of life, we are in death.

427
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.323
Welcome to the first meeting-
- This is bullshit.

428
00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:17.833
For a guy who calls himself the Comedian,
l can never tell when you're joking.

429
00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:21.436
Watchmen. That's the real joke.

430
00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:24.370
lt didn't work 15 years ago,
and it ain't gonna work now...

431
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.669
...because you wanna play
cowboys and lndians.

432
00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:29.244
Maybe we should agree
on no drinking at meetings.

433
00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:34.745
Rorschach and I have made headway
on the gang problem by working together.

434
00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:39.286
A group this si<i>z</i>e seems like
a publicity stunt. l'm not in it for the ink.

435
00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:41.253
We can do so much more.

436
00:42:41.458 --> 00:42:43.653
We can save this world...

437
00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:48.390
- ... with the right leadership.
- Yeah.

438
00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:52.497
And that'd be you, right, o<i>zz</i>y?

439
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:55.468
l mean, hell,
you're the smartest man on the planet.

440
00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:58.268
lt doesn't take a genius
to see the world has problems.

441
00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:02.237
But it takes a room of morons to think
they're small enough for you to handle.

442
00:43:03.213 --> 00:43:07.206
You know, mankind's been trying to kill
each other off since the beginning of time.

443
00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:12.220
Now we finally have the power
to finish the job.

444
00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:16.052
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

445
00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:21.220
Then o<i>z</i>ymandias here...

446
00:43:22.232 --> 00:43:24.530
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

447
00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.469
For as much as it hath pleased...

448
00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:40.649
...almighty God to take onto himself
the soul of our dear departed brother...

449
00:43:42.052 --> 00:43:46.079
...let us therefore commit his body
to the ground.

450
00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:49.748
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

451
00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:15.248
Watchmen! Police!
Police to protect the people!

452
00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:23.850
Attention, citi<i>z</i>ens.
We are trying to maintain order.

453
00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:28.465
You must clear the streets
until the police strike is over.

454
00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:31.829
lf you could-
Please, there's no need for violence.

455
00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:35.063
Goddamn it. All right.
That's how you wanna do it?

456
00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.442
There's no need for violence.

457
00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:51.746
Fuck you. Fuck you!

458
00:44:58.062 --> 00:44:59.757
Oh, this is getting heavy.

459
00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.021
Goddamn, I love working
on American soil, Dan.

460
00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:29.624
Ain't had this much fun
since Woodward and Bernstein.

461
00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:31.419
How long can we keep this up?

462
00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:35.223
Congress is pushing through some new bill
that's gonna outlaw masks.

463
00:45:35.365 --> 00:45:36.627
our days are numbered.

464
00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:41.066
Until then, it's like you always say:
We're society's only protection.

465
00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:45.834
- From what?
- Are you kidding me? From themselves.

466
00:45:45.976 --> 00:45:48.171
- Son of a bitch.
No, Comedian, wait!

467
00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:51.647
Get your stinking hands off me.

468
00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:56.285
What the hell happened to us?

469
00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:02.890
What happened to the American dream?

470
00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:06.527
What happened to the American dream?

471
00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.824
lt came true!

472
00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:11.024
You're looking at it.

473
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:33.339
Edgar William Jacobi.

474
00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:37.351
Also known as Edgar William Vaughn.
Also known as Moloch.

475
00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:43.655
What are you talking about?

476
00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:46.027
l'm a retired businessman-

477
00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:51.165
Lie again, Moloch, I break another finger.

478
00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:53.360
l did my time.

479
00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:56.335
l'm not Moloch anymore.

480
00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:01.309
- What do you want from me?
- Heard you attended Blake's funeral. Why?

481
00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:04.970
l just felt I should...

482
00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:09.084
...pay my respects to the Comedian.

483
00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:16.288
- How'd you know he was the Comedian?
- He broke in here. A week ago.

484
00:48:16.426 --> 00:48:18.792
He had his mask off.

485
00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:22.721
- He was drunk.
- Enemies. For decades.

486
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.926
- Why should he visit you?
- I don't know.

487
00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:29.038
l woke up in my bedroom
and there he was.

488
00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:31.197
He was upset.

489
00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:33.300
He was crying.

490
00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.108
Crying? The Comedian?

491
00:48:36.246 --> 00:48:39.238
He was babbling, not making any sense.

492
00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:42.418
l was pissing in my pants.

493
00:48:42.619 --> 00:48:44.917
l thought he was gonna kill me.

494
00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:47.352
What did he say?

495
00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:50.320
lt's a joke.

496
00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:53.621
lt's all a fucking joke.

497
00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:58.066
You know, I thought I knew how it was.

498
00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:01.204
l thought I knew how the world was.

499
00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:05.000
l've done some bad things.

500
00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:09.271
l did bad things to women. I shot kids.

501
00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:11.709
ln 'Nam, you know.

502
00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:13.715
But that was fucking war.

503
00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:16.083
This...

504
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.382
l never done anything like this.

505
00:49:22.092 --> 00:49:24.993
God, here I am...

506
00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:27.288
...spilling my guts...

507
00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:29.221
...to one of my archenemies.

508
00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:33.733
But the truth is...

509
00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:38.934
...you're the closest thing to a friend I got.
What the fuck does that say?

510
00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:45.041
Shit.

511
00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:48.243
And your name...

512
00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:50.943
...your name was on the list...

513
00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:55.521
...along with Janey, you know,
whatever the fuck her name is.

514
00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:58.127
Manhattan's old girl.

515
00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:04.459
Mother, forgive me.

516
00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:07.330
And then he left.

517
00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:12.934
l swear I don't know
what the hell he was talking about.

518
00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:21.651
Funny story.

519
00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:24.450
Sounds unbelievable.

520
00:50:25.255 --> 00:50:27.155
Probably true.

521
00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:30.053
So that's it?

522
00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:34.357
- l'm clean?
- You?

523
00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:36.862
Clean?

524
00:50:41.805 --> 00:50:42.897
Amygdalin.

525
00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:45.769
This phony medication
made from apricot pits.

526
00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:49.173
- lt's illegal.
- Come on.

527
00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:53.379
Please don't confiscate that.

528
00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:57.014
l'm trying anything.

529
00:50:58.522 --> 00:50:59.989
l have cancer.

530
00:51:00.957 --> 00:51:02.322
What kind of cancer?

531
00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:07.219
You know the kind
you eventually get better from?

532
00:51:09.132 --> 00:51:11.123
That ain't the kind I got.

533
00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:18.330
Rorschach's journal. October 16th.

534
00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:21.340
Want some of this?
Fifty bucks, l'll suck your cock.

535
00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:24.343
- Thought about Moloch's story.
- Come on.

536
00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:26.449
Could all be lies.

537
00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:30.950
A revenge scheme
planned during his years behind bars.

538
00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:36.185
Fuck you. I make more in a week
than you make in a year, you fucking homo.

539
00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:37.951
But if it's true...

540
00:51:38.161 --> 00:51:40.391
...what could have possibly
scared the Comedian...

541
00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:42.464
...enough to cry in front of Moloch?

542
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.858
What was it he saw?

543
00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:48.264
And that list he mentioned.

544
00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:55.877
Edward Blake. The Comedian.

545
00:51:56.012 --> 00:51:58.412
Born 1918.

546
00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:00.550
Buried in the rain.

547
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.615
Murdered.

548
00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:06.812
ls that what happens to us?
No time for friends?

549
00:52:07.757 --> 00:52:10.920
Only our enemies leave roses.

550
00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:14.129
Violent lives ending violently.

551
00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:21.161
Blake understood.
Humans are savage in nature.

552
00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:24.034
No matter how much you try
to dress it up...

553
00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:26.334
...to disguise it...

554
00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:29.637
...Blake saw society's true face.

555
00:52:29.846 --> 00:52:34.442
Chose to be a parody of it. A joke.

556
00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:36.278
l heard joke once.

557
00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:41.287
Man goes to doctor, says he's depressed.

558
00:52:41.458 --> 00:52:45.360
Life seems harsh and cruel.

559
00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:49.363
Says he feels all alone
in threatening world.

560
00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:52.364
Doctor says treatment is simple.

561
00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:57.172
"The great clown Pagliacci is in town.
Go see him.

562
00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:59.365
That should pick you up."

563
00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:02.709
Man bursts into tears.

564
00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:07.213
"But doctor, " he says."l am Pagliacci."

565
00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:10.947
Good joke.

566
00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:13.154
Everybody laugh.

567
00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:15.518
Roll on snare drum.

568
00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:17.516
Curtains.

569
00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:28.234
What time do you have to be
at your interview?

570
00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:30.032
Don't worry.

571
00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.131
We've got plenty of time.

572
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:42.377
Your finger's like licking a battery.

573
00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:05.436
God, Jon, stop. What are you doing?

574
00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:06.940
Please don't be upset.

575
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:10.807
l always thought you liked this.

576
00:54:10.947 --> 00:54:12.346
No.

577
00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:16.852
l don't- No.

578
00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:20.519
l don't want that.

579
00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:23.952
l don't know
what stimulates you anymore.

580
00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:29.724
Look, I know you were just trying-

581
00:54:31.534 --> 00:54:34.025
Are you working in here
while we're in bed together?

582
00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:37.628
My work with Adrian
is at a critical stage right now.

583
00:54:38.074 --> 00:54:41.237
- I didn't think it was necessary to-
- To what?

584
00:54:41.444 --> 00:54:44.936
To what? To tell me which one of you
is giving me a pity fuck?

585
00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:56.557
My attention was completely focused
on you.

586
00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.458
lf you think there's a problem
with my attitude...

587
00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:01.791
...l am prepared to discuss it.

588
00:55:03.533 --> 00:55:07.299
You know how everything in this world
fits together except people.

589
00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:11.897
What am I to you?
Another pu<i>zz</i>le to be solved?

590
00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:15.805
Have your men stand back.
l'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now.

591
00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:19.548
You're my only remaining link
to the world.

592
00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:29.951
l don't want that responsibility anymore.

593
00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.959
He's all yours.

594
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.372
Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.

595
00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:50.039
No, she won't.

596
00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:08.690
He's been called
many things: Hero, weapon...

597
00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:11.633
...linchpin of our national security...

598
00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:16.329
...deterrent to nuclear war,
or a man to end worlds.

599
00:56:16.706 --> 00:56:19.231
Later tonight, Dr. Manhattan...

600
00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:24.403
...will answer my questions and yours
in an exclusive interview...

601
00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:29.450
...brought to you commercial-free
by Veidt Enterprises.

602
00:56:44.334 --> 00:56:45.562
Who is it?

603
00:56:45.735 --> 00:56:47.726
lt's Laurie.

604
00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:01.778
Sorry. I just had this new lock installed.

605
00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:04.476
l didn't know where else to go.

606
00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:07.784
Oh, it's okay. Come in.

607
00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:16.289
What's wrong?

608
00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.192
l left Jon.

609
00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:22.201
Oh, God.

610
00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:24.400
l'm so sorry.

611
00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:27.405
l don't know why l'm here. I just...

612
00:57:28.945 --> 00:57:31.413
l don't know anybody else.

613
00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:35.547
l don't know anybody
except for goddamn superheroes.

614
00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:37.813
That's okay.

615
00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:40.251
You probably just had an argument
or something.

616
00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:41.822
No, Dan.

617
00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:45.021
You don't know what it's been like
living with him.

618
00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:48.322
The way he looks at things now,
it's like he doesn't...

619
00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:50.965
...remember what they are.

620
00:57:51.334 --> 00:57:53.461
lt's like this world, this real world...

621
00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:57.436
...to him,
it's like walking through mist.

622
00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:01.098
And people are just shadows.

623
00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:05.170
Shadows in a fog.

624
00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:09.683
God, how did everything
get so tangled up?

625
00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:13.278
l'm sorry, Dan.

626
00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:17.015
This is twice now
l've ruined your evening.

627
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:20.486
Come on. l'm glad you came over.

628
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:24.191
l was just gonna see Hollis
for our weekly beer session.

629
00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:26.325
You're more than welcome to join.

630
00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:30.803
ln fact, I insist.

631
00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:06.071
Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives
and no one thinks to tell me.

632
00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:08.176
He just-
- We don't have time for makeup.

633
00:59:08.311 --> 00:59:10.609
That blue is too light for television.

634
00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:15.384
ls that dark enough?

635
00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:21.020
Yeah, that's dark enough.

636
00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:25.886
Seymour.
Bernie, how's tricks?

637
00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:29.430
See this guy behind me?
Been bugging me all week.

638
00:59:41.444 --> 00:59:43.708
Girl.
What we got here?

639
00:59:43.913 --> 00:59:46.746
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved
no-go areas.

640
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:49.714
Afghanistan will obviously come up,
but just play it cool...

641
00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:52.319
...and try not to get
into any tight corners.

642
00:59:52.455 --> 00:59:56.152
- a renowned nuclear physicist,
who, through a terrible accident...

643
00:59:56.326 --> 01:00:02.128
...was gifted with extraordinary powers,
capable of bending matter to his will.

644
01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:06.531
Today, the world knows him
as Dr. Manhattan.

645
01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:08.033
Welcome.

646
01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:14.270
Thank you.

647
01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.378
That's right.

648
01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:25.750
Ms. Black, you have the first question.

649
01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:27.354
Dr. Manhattan, as you know...

650
01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:30.253
...the Doomsday Clock
is a symbolic clock face...

651
01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:33.954
...analogi<i>z</i>ing humankind's proximity
to extinction...

652
01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.289
...midnight representing the threat
of nuclear war.

653
01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:40.664
As of now, it stands at four minutes
to midnight.

654
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.761
Would you agree that we're that close
to annihilation?

655
01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:46.471
My father was a watchmaker.

656
01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:51.679
He abandoned it when Einstein discovered
that time is relative.

657
01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:54.806
l would only agree
that a symbolic clock...

658
01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:56.986
...is as nourishing to the intellect...

659
01:00:57.186 --> 01:01:00.417
...as a photograph of oxygen
to a drowning man.

660
01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.454
So you're saying there is no danger.

661
01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:08.620
Even in a world without
nuclear weapons, there would still be danger.

662
01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:16.470
And would you say, as so many claim...

663
01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:18.436
...that you are, in fact, a god...

664
01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:21.441
...given you see the past
and future simultaneously?

665
01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.875
l can only see my own past...

666
01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:28.249
...my own future. I am not omniscient.

667
01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:30.250
Doug Roth, your question?

668
01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:33.150
Speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan...

669
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:36.053
...do you remember a man
named Wally Weaver?

670
01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:41.356
Yes. We were both physicists together
at the Gila Flats Research Base.

671
01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:43.456
He died of cancer.

672
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.564
- He was a good man.
RoTH: How about Edgar Jacobi...

673
01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:49.670
...also known as the supervillain Moloch?

674
01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:54.702
You encountered him several times
in the '60s: battles, conflicts.

675
01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:57.379
Did you know that he has cancer as well?

676
01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:59.576
l wasn't told.

677
01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.911
And what about
General Anthony Randolph?

678
01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:05.519
He was your handler when you first
started working for the government.

679
01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:06.911
Cancer.

680
01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:09.819
You're suggesting I was the cause.

681
01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:13.218
From where l'm standing,
it's starting to look pretty conclusive.

682
01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:15.421
Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.

683
01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:18.363
A live human body
and a deceased human body...

684
01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.627
...have the same number of particles.

685
01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:25.272
Structurally, there's no difference.

686
01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:34.042
All right. Let's settle down, please.

687
01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:44.087
What about Janey Slater?

688
01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:47.193
You think it makes a difference to her?

689
01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:49.595
Janey?

690
01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.490
Your ex-girlfriend?

691
01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:55.296
She was a physicist too.
You saw each other for 11 years.

692
01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:56.995
Doug, one question at a time.

693
01:02:57.173 --> 01:03:00.506
She has cancer as well.
Doctors have given her six months.

694
01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:02.508
lsn't that right, Miss Slater?

695
01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:19.824
You were the world to me, Jon.

696
01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:22.659
You were my whole life.

697
01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:26.227
Do you remember how many times
you said you loved me?

698
01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:28.064
Janey, I wasn't told.

699
01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:33.942
l stuck by you after the accident.
l gave you everything.

700
01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:40.643
This is how you repay me?

701
01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:45.986
- Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know.
- Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.

702
01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:48.146
Janey, wait.

703
01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:51.993
- That's it. This interview is over.
Get up there.

704
01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:54.561
Get those cameras off.
Everybody back off.

705
01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:58.394
Everybody back off.
l need some backup here. Leave him alone.

706
01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:04.598
Please, if everyone
would just go away...

707
01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:07.708
...and leave me alone...

708
01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.243
Do you care to comment?

709
01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:12.438
l said, leave me alone!

710
01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:25.220
l am looking at the stars.

711
01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.719
They're so far away...

712
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.826
...and their light takes so long
to reach us...

713
01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:37.734
...all we ever see of stars
are their old photographs.

714
01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:44.577
lt is July, 1959, and I am in love.

715
01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:47.075
That's great.

716
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.877
- You can pick it up tomorrow.
- okay.

717
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.780
- Seventy-five cents.
- okay, thank you.

718
01:04:50.953 --> 01:04:51.977
Thank you.

719
01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:56.352
Gosh, Jon, I wish he gave us a little notice.
l'm sure I made a face.

720
01:04:56.559 --> 01:05:01.496
Oh, no, no.
l'm sure that you'll look beautiful.

721
01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:07.699
Her name is Janey Slater.

722
01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:11.199
She is a physicist, like me.

723
01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:14.237
l am 30 years old.

724
01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:22.917
We were introduced by a good friend
of mine from college, Wally Weaver.

725
01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:29.116
lt is February 12th, 1981.

726
01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:33.024
Wally dies of cancer,
of which they now say I am the cause.

727
01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:53.980
That night, Janey and I make love
for the first time.

728
01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:02.924
A month from now,
the accident awaits me.

729
01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:13.591
Oh, l'll catch up with you guys.
l think I left my watch inside.

730
01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.498
Hey. Let's just wait a second.

731
01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:23.711
l cross the room to the
lntrinsic Field Center. I find my watch.

732
01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:31.545
When I get to the door...

733
01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:34.516
...Wally is turning white.

734
01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:38.751
The program's locked in.
We can't override the time lock.

735
01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.460
l am terrified.

736
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:42.654
Jon?

737
01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:50.366
l'm sorry, Jon...

738
01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:53.831
...but I can't-

739
01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:57.635
Janey, don't leave me!

740
01:06:58.247 --> 01:07:00.215
Don't leave me!

741
01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:34.308
lt is May 12th, 1959,
when l'm introduced to Janey.

742
01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.708
She buys me a beer...

743
01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:39.719
...the first time a woman
has done this for me.

744
01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:43.915
As she passes me the cold,
perspiring glass...

745
01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:46.421
...our fingers touch.

746
01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:58.732
Yes, Jon, good.

747
01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:04.379
Now it's just a question of reassembling
the components in the correct sequence.

748
01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:09.309
l feel fear...

749
01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.679
...for the last time.

750
01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.236
A token funeral is held.

751
01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:33.575
There is nothing to bury.

752
01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.309
Janey frames the snapshot.

753
01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:39.445
lt's the only photograph of me
anyone has.

754
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:45.618
A circulatory system is seen
by the perimeter fence.

755
01:08:46.021 --> 01:08:47.511
A few days later...

756
01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:50.921
...a partially muscled skeleton
stands in a hallway...

757
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:54.928
...and screams for a moment
before vanishing.

758
01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:21.079
Oh, God.

759
01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:22.780
Jon?

760
01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.691
ls that you?

761
01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:29.056
Nations around the world
reeling from this morning's announcement...

762
01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:31.893
...possibly the most significant event
in recent history.

763
01:09:32.034 --> 01:09:35.993
We repeat, the superman exists,
and he is American.

764
01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:45.105
They call me Dr. Manhattan.

765
01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:57.624
They explain the name
has been chosen...

766
01:09:57.826 --> 01:10:02.024
...for the ominous associations
it will raise in America's enemies.

767
01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:07.059
They are shaping me
into something gaudy...

768
01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.264
...something lethal.

769
01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:16.567
ln January, 1971 ...

770
01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:20.738
...President Nixon asks me to intervene
in Vietnam...

771
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:24.249
...something that his predecessors
would not ask.

772
01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:28.354
A week later, the conflict ends.

773
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:32.950
Some of the Vietcong forces
wanna surrender to me personally.

774
01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:38.358
Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero,
writes a book.

775
01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:42.594
ln it, he calls my arrival
the dawn of the superhero.

776
01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.016
l am not sure if I know what that means.

777
01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:04.317
You see, at the time, I was misquoted.

778
01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.620
l never said, "The superman exists
and he is American."

779
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:13.769
What I said was, "God exists,
and he is American."

780
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.761
Now, if you begin to feel an intense...

781
01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:20.841
...and crushing feeling of religious terror
at the concept...

782
01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.268
...don't be alarmed.

783
01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:27.973
That indicates only
that you are still sane.

784
01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:32.178
lt is Christmas, 1963.

785
01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:35.852
Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried.

786
01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:39.754
She says I am like a god now.

787
01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:43.158
l tell her I don't think there is a God...

788
01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:46.763
...and if there is, l'm nothing like him.

789
01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:49.871
l tell her I still want her...

790
01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:52.664
...and that I always will.

791
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:58.373
As I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970.

792
01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:02.706
l am in a room
full of people wearing disguises.

793
01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:08.513
A very young girl looks at me and smiles.

794
01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:11.249
She's beautiful.

795
01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:18.157
After each long kiss, she plants a smaller,
gentler one upon my lips...

796
01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.325
...like a signature.

797
01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:24.833
Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.

798
01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:30.641
She bursts into angry tears,
asking if it's because she's getting older.

799
01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.643
lt's true.

800
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:37.742
She's aging more noticeably every day...

801
01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.158
...while I am standing still.

802
01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:50.759
l prefer the stillness here.

803
01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:53.860
l am tired of Earth.

804
01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.663
These people.

805
01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:59.968
l'm tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.

806
01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:26.064
They claim their labors
are to build a heaven...

807
01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:30.127
...yet their heaven is populated
with horrors.

808
01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:33.233
Perhaps the world is not made.

809
01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:36.244
Perhaps nothing is made.

810
01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:40.673
A clock without a craftsman.

811
01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.641
lt's too late.

812
01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:45.952
Always has been...

813
01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:48.783
...always will be...

814
01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:50.985
...too late.

815
01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.193
Mr. President...

816
01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:02.936
...the Soviets have moved their tanks
to just short of the Afghan border.

817
01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:04.799
They are testing us...

818
01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:09.410
...to see if we manufactured
Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...

819
01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:12.307
...to coax a move out of them.

820
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.817
How soon can we be ready
for a preemptive strike?

821
01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:20.310
Two days.

822
01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:24.419
We have a 54 percent chance
of wiping out the entire U.S.S.R...

823
01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.619
...before they get their missiles airborne.

824
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:28.856
Assuming conservative projections...

825
01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:31.727
...of how many Soviet warheads
we destroy beforehand...

826
01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:34.365
...we'll lose all of the East Coast.

827
01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:36.661
The last gasp...

828
01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:40.041
...of the Harvard establishment.

829
01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:43.741
Let's see them think their way
out of fission.

830
01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:47.473
With anticipated wind patterns,
the fallout drift would head south.

831
01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.879
Mexico would catch the worst of it.

832
01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:52.145
Most of the farm belt
might remain unaffected.

833
01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:53.948
Not so bad...

834
01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:57.354
...all things considered.

835
01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:01.891
Mr. President...

836
01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:03.689
...what would you like to do?

837
01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:14.405
Take us to DEFCON two.

838
01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:16.511
Begin fueling the bombers.

839
01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:20.046
Dr. Manhattan has two days.

840
01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.313
After that...

841
01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:26.114
...humanity is in the hands
of a higher authority than mine.

842
01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:29.657
Let's just hope he's on our side.

843
01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:32.621
Without Dr. Manhattan around...

844
01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:35.662
...to bully the Russians into peace,
Mr. Veidt...

845
01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:40.234
...people are going to need good,
old-fashioned energy to rely on.

846
01:15:40.435 --> 01:15:42.062
You can understand.

847
01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:47.334
The world can't just quit on oil
and nuclear power cold turkey.

848
01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.773
You'll dismantle
our entire economy overnight.

849
01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:52.743
You're right, Lee. And why free energy?

850
01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:55.782
Well, "free" is just another word
for "socialist."

851
01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:57.942
We might have to
make a public inquiry...

852
01:15:58.086 --> 01:16:01.283
...into any past communist affiliations
you might have had.

853
01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.591
Mr. lacocca, gentlemen...

854
01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:07.991
...l respect your position...

855
01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:12.032
...and what you've accomplished
as captains of industry. I do.

856
01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:14.925
You wanna know my past? Hm?

857
01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:18.501
okay. Happily.

858
01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:22.108
lt's a matter of public record that by 17,
both my parents were dead...

859
01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:24.142
...leaving me alone.

860
01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:28.514
l guess you could say
l've always been alone.

861
01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:33.620
They say l'm the smartest man in the world,
but the truth is l've often felt stupid...

862
01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:37.247
...at being unable to relate to anyone.

863
01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:40.827
Well, anyone living, that is.

864
01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:42.963
The only person
with whom I felt kinship...

865
01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:46.259
...died 300 years
before the birth of Christ.

866
01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:51.839
Alexander of Macedonia,
or Alexander the Great, as you know him.

867
01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.032
His vision of a united world was...

868
01:16:58.347 --> 01:17:00.042
Well, it was unprecedented.

869
01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:01.876
l wanted...

870
01:17:02.017 --> 01:17:04.315
...needed to match
his accomplishments...

871
01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:07.683
...so I resolved to apply antiquity's
teachings to our world today.

872
01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:11.381
And so began my path to conquest.

873
01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:14.791
Conquest not of men...

874
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:17.797
...but of the evils that beset them.

875
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.903
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power...

876
01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:25.938
...are like a drug, and you,
along with foreign interests...

877
01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:27.700
- ... are the pushers.
- Now, listen.

878
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.902
No.

879
01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:34.111
You listen.

880
01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:37.908
The world will survive...

881
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.556
...and it deserves more
than you've been able to provide.

882
01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:44.317
So let's cut to it, shall we?

883
01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:47.117
l'm worth more
than all of your corporations combined.

884
01:17:47.262 --> 01:17:50.823
l could buy and sell you, something
you should factor into your decision...

885
01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:57.336
...should you choose
to make our disagreement public.

886
01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.172
l think you know the way out.

887
01:18:02.911 --> 01:18:04.674
Gentlemen.

888
01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:10.674
The toy people wanna talk to you about
new villains for the o<i>z</i>ymandias line.

889
01:18:10.819 --> 01:18:14.277
- Seems all the old villains are dead.
- Mr. Veidt?

890
01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:18.016
- I think I have some ideas.
- Mr. Veidt?

891
01:18:18.226 --> 01:18:21.024
l think we got off on the wrong foot.

892
01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:59.428
He's got a poison capsule.

893
01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:04.471
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch.
Who sent you? I want a name.

894
01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:05.765
Give me a name!

895
01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.183
Suicide pill.

896
01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:23.189
Potassium cyanide.
Guy was dead before he hit the ground.

897
01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:25.188
Thanks, hon.

898
01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:27.718
Then Rorschach was right.

899
01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:30.090
This wasn't some lone nut.

900
01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:34.394
lt's an organi<i>z</i>ation:
well-funded, well-equipped.

901
01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:37.303
But who'd wanna kill us now?

902
01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:41.735
l don't know, but it's not safe out here.

903
01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:49.249
So no word from Jon?

904
01:19:50.218 --> 01:19:51.810
No.

905
01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.120
Well, listen...

906
01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.318
...why don't you come stay with me?

907
01:19:57.659 --> 01:20:00.628
Oh, no.
That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.

908
01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:04.530
Oh, no. No.
Think of it as doing me a favor.

909
01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:08.666
l wouldn't have to worry about you
being out there.

910
01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.335
okay.

911
01:20:16.378 --> 01:20:21.839
Rorschach's journal, October 21st, 1985.

912
01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:26.079
On 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg
and Jupiter leaving diner.

913
01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:29.451
They didn't know me without my mask.

914
01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:31.953
An affair?

915
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.062
Did she break Manhattan's heart
to engineer his exile...

916
01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:38.164
...make room for Dreiberg?

917
01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:42.164
Does Manhattan even have a heart
to break?

918
01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:50.975
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife
named Roy Chess.

919
01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.310
At his apartment, I found clues.

920
01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:59.214
Seems he worked
at Pyramid Transnational.

921
01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:01.752
l've seen the logo before...

922
01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:04.218
...at Moloch's.

923
01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:11.432
Someone tried to shoot
the world's smartest man today, Moloch.

924
01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:15.032
Guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.

925
01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:17.330
More than a just delivery service,
l take it.

926
01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:21.441
Last time I was here, I saw a pension check
written from the same company.

927
01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:25.135
l'm guessing it's a front set up
by whoever wants us masks dead.

928
01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:28.875
Now, no more lies, Moloch.
Who runs Pyramid?

929
01:21:33.755 --> 01:21:35.382
FlNE
Rorschach.

930
01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.957
This is the police.
We know you're in there.

931
01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:39.990
No. No!

932
01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:43.255
lf there's anybody in there with you,
send them out unharmed.

933
01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:46.400
No. No, no, no!

934
01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:50.971
Framed. Walked right into it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

935
01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:52.764
Never, never surrender.

936
01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:55.966
All right.
l hope you're ready, hero.

937
01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.169
When you are.

938
01:22:19.834 --> 01:22:20.823
one...

939
01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:26.932
...two...

940
01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:31.970
...three.

941
01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:25.728
Come on.

942
01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:37.977
Son of a bitch.

943
01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:41.347
- Christ, he stinks.
- Get that mask off him.

944
01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:44.347
- I got it.
- No. No!

945
01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:47.248
My face! Give me back my face!

946
01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:50.684
The masked vigilante Rorschach
was apprehended...

947
01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:54.760
...and identified
as Walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.

948
01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:57.956
Little's known about Kovacs,
but he was charged with the murder...

949
01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:01.897
...of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head
in his home in the Bronx.

950
01:24:02.103 --> 01:24:05.095
Police officers were injured
and Jacobi's home was set abla<i>z</i>e...

951
01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:07.831
...during the violent course
of the capture.

952
01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:12.943
Rorschach!

953
01:24:13.114 --> 01:24:16.845
l'm gonna fuck you
like I fucked your mother!

954
01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:26.460
Come on out, Rorschach!

955
01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:28.858
Walter Kovacs.

956
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:31.931
ls that your name? Walter?

957
01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:36.128
Well, let me explain
your situation here, Walter.

958
01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:37.861
You cooperate with me...

959
01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:42.533
...and I may be able to convince them
that you should be treated medically.

960
01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:46.271
ln a hospital. I believe
that would be good for you.

961
01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:52.478
But the authorities wanna put you
with the general population.

962
01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:56.448
- Prison's a prison.
- Uh-huh. Yes.

963
01:24:57.058 --> 01:25:00.425
But the difference is, down there...

964
01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:02.394
...you'd be eaten alive.

965
01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:07.597
You're responsible for a lot of them
being in prison here, Walter.

966
01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:12.105
Tell me what you see.

967
01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:18.939
A pretty butterfly.

968
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:24.615
What about now? What do you see here?

969
01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:30.748
Mom?

970
01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:32.524
ls he hurting you?

971
01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:35.560
You got a fucking kid in here.
l get that at home.

972
01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:39.222
Bastard.
l should have had that abortion.

973
01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:50.843
Some nice flowers.

974
01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:58.246
l heard this guy's mom's a whore.

975
01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:03.184
Did you catch any diseases from her?

976
01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:08.192
Huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.

977
01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:12.728
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick
for a dollar?

978
01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:32.512
Clouds.

979
01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:40.154
Tell me about Rorschach.
Will you do that, Walter?

980
01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:43.853
You keep calling me Walter.
l don't like you.

981
01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:49.164
You don't like me.
All right, why is that, exactly?

982
01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:50.736
You're fat.

983
01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:54.433
Wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.

984
01:26:54.842 --> 01:26:57.538
You wanna know about Rorschach?

985
01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.073
l'll tell you about Rorschach.

986
01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:05.385
l was investigating a kidnap case.

987
01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:08.988
Blaire Roche.

988
01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:12.581
Six-year-old girl. I was young then.

989
01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:15.792
Too soft on criminals.

990
01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.392
l let them live.

991
01:27:19.634 --> 01:27:25.402
Broke a man's arm to get a tip.
Led me to the missing girl's location.

992
01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:35.414
l knew the girl was here...

993
01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:39.109
...but when I searched the place,
l saw nothing.

994
01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:42.421
And then I found her.

995
01:28:34.042 --> 01:28:37.307
lt was dark when the murderer got back.

996
01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:42.512
As dark as it gets.

997
01:29:09.577 --> 01:29:14.412
Oh, God.
Who's out there? Who is it?

998
01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:17.377
Who is it?

999
01:29:28.096 --> 01:29:31.532
What? What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

1000
01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:36.193
What the fuck do you want?
You killed my dogs, man!

1001
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:45.737
You think I had something to do
with that girl? I found that.

1002
01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:48.404
What evidence have you got?
That's nothing.

1003
01:29:56.324 --> 01:29:59.122
okay. I confess.

1004
01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:03.024
l kidnapped her. I killed her.

1005
01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:05.230
Arrest me.

1006
01:30:06.033 --> 01:30:07.728
What? Arrest me!

1007
01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:11.328
l did it! I said I did it!

1008
01:30:11.472 --> 01:30:12.939
Christ.

1009
01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:17.374
Look, l've got a problem, man.
Fucking take me in. I need help.

1010
01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:24.948
No, don't. Don't do that.
Take me in. Don't! No!

1011
01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:33.383
Men get arrested.

1012
01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.853
Dogs get put down.

1013
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:43.864
Tremors of impact shook my arm.

1014
01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:47.571
Warm blood splashed my face.

1015
01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:52.906
Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs
died that night with that little girl.

1016
01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:56.179
From then on, there was only Rorschach.

1017
01:30:57.685 --> 01:31:00.415
See, doctor, God didn't kill that little girl.

1018
01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:05.019
Fate didn't butcher her
and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.

1019
01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:09.663
lf God saw what any of us did that night,
he didn't seem to mind.

1020
01:31:11.566 --> 01:31:13.431
From then on, I knew:

1021
01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:17.067
God doesn't make the world this way.

1022
01:31:19.073 --> 01:31:20.563
We do.

1023
01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:22.436
Hey, Rorschach.

1024
01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:26.036
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?

1025
01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:28.874
Rorschach, I heard your mother
was a whore.

1026
01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:32.645
Hey, you know what?
l'm pretty famous too.

1027
01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:35.347
- Ain't that right? That's right.
That's right.

1028
01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:40.188
Maybe I can give you an autograph.
What you say, big boy?

1029
01:31:55.476 --> 01:31:59.003
None of you seem to understand.
l'm not locked in here with you.

1030
01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.205
All right, that's it!

1031
01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:04.517
You're locked in here with me.

1032
01:33:06.347 --> 01:33:07.405
Laurie!

1033
01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:09.947
Shit.

1034
01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:12.852
Hold on.
- Fuck.

1035
01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:17.613
l got it, I got it, I got it.

1036
01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:25.731
l'm so sorry. I was snooping
and must have hit the wrong button.

1037
01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:27.332
- Are you hurt?
- No, no.

1038
01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:30.629
- okay.
- l'm fine. I just feel so bad.

1039
01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:32.762
No, don't worry.

1040
01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:36.239
lt's happened before.
Comedian did it back in '77.

1041
01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:39.176
Archie survived that.

1042
01:33:39.647 --> 01:33:40.944
Archie?

1043
01:33:41.682 --> 01:33:45.140
oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...

1044
01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:46.843
...Merlin's pet owl.

1045
01:33:47.955 --> 01:33:49.650
Stupid nickname.

1046
01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:53.455
How did you ever afford
all this stuff, anyway?

1047
01:33:53.661 --> 01:33:59.156
Well, my dad was in corporate banking
and left me a lot of money when he died...

1048
01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:03.199
...which always surprised me.
l mean, he was...

1049
01:34:03.838 --> 01:34:06.500
l think he was disappointed
l went into crime fighting...

1050
01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:08.336
...instead of following him.

1051
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:16.107
Guess I was just more interested in
birds and airplanes, mythology and...

1052
01:34:17.518 --> 01:34:20.214
Must be nice having a secret identity.

1053
01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:23.016
A secret place that nobody knows about.

1054
01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:28.218
You can just come down here and hang out
without anyone checking up on you.

1055
01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:32.062
Nobody watching you.

1056
01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:36.460
Wanna try those on?

1057
01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.943
There we go.

1058
01:34:52.086 --> 01:34:54.077
Wow, these rock.

1059
01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:59.255
They amplify the spectral range.

1060
01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.485
Thermal imaging.

1061
01:35:03.197 --> 01:35:05.131
They work even better in the dark.

1062
01:35:10.104 --> 01:35:11.833
You can see me, right?

1063
01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:16.704
l can see everything.

1064
01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:22.905
l remember, no matter how black it got...

1065
01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:27.414
...whenever I looked through those goggles,
everything was as clear as day.

1066
01:35:29.724 --> 01:35:32.022
This must be the way Jon sees the world.

1067
01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:37.429
We should probably head up.
Food's getting cold.

1068
01:35:37.631 --> 01:35:39.724
Put those away when you're done.

1069
01:35:48.442 --> 01:35:50.535
Soviets are
finding themselves bogged down...

1070
01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:52.441
...in bloody house-to-house fighting.

1071
01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:55.140
Casualties on both sides
are said to be in the hundreds.

1072
01:35:55.349 --> 01:35:58.375
Civilian deaths are also alarmingly high.

1073
01:35:58.552 --> 01:36:00.213
Dan.

1074
01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:02.684
Jon sees a lot of things...

1075
01:36:05.092 --> 01:36:07.390
...but he doesn't see me.

1076
01:36:14.535 --> 01:36:16.093
Well, uh...

1077
01:37:09.690 --> 01:37:10.987
Sorry.

1078
01:37:13.027 --> 01:37:14.324
Come here.

1079
01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:21.598
What's the matter?

1080
01:37:21.735 --> 01:37:24.203
- lf you could just move a little...
- okay.

1081
01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:25.396
Yeah. There you go.

1082
01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:27.700
Soviet ambassador to the U.N.
had no comment...

1083
01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:30.138
...when asked if Dr. Manhattan's
disappearance...

1084
01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:32.905
...has fueled Soviet aggression
in Afghanistan.

1085
01:37:33.113 --> 01:37:35.707
Dan, what's wrong?

1086
01:37:37.418 --> 01:37:38.510
Sorry, l...

1087
01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:42.918
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.

1088
01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:47.116
Oh, hell.

1089
01:37:48.929 --> 01:37:51.261
lt's been a long time, Rorschach.

1090
01:37:51.932 --> 01:37:53.422
Big Figure.

1091
01:37:53.767 --> 01:37:55.632
Small world.

1092
01:37:56.937 --> 01:37:58.427
l like that.

1093
01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.572
But you know, it is a small world in here.

1094
01:38:01.976 --> 01:38:04.774
And l've been in it for,
how long now, Lloyd?

1095
01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:07.073
Almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.

1096
01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:08.712
That's right.

1097
01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:13.209
Fifteen years since you
and that owl fella put me away.

1098
01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:17.383
So...

1099
01:38:17.925 --> 01:38:22.692
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying.
Could go any minute.

1100
01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:28.096
You know, by my count, there are more
than 50 people in here that you put away.

1101
01:38:28.235 --> 01:38:32.604
l been talking to every one of them
and they're all dying to get a piece of you.

1102
01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:36.039
This place is gonna explode!

1103
01:38:37.611 --> 01:38:40.307
Then, you die by inches.

1104
01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:42.910
Tall order.

1105
01:38:43.117 --> 01:38:45.608
l'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.

1106
01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.312
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.

1107
01:38:50.124 --> 01:38:51.455
Come on.

1108
01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.237
Dan?

1109
01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:22.742
ls everything all right?

1110
01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:28.054
l'm tired of being afraid.

1111
01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:31.455
Afraid of war...

1112
01:40:32.292 --> 01:40:35.853
...afraid of the mask killer...

1113
01:40:37.464 --> 01:40:40.661
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...

1114
01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.802
...and how much I need it.

1115
01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:45.297
Me too.

1116
01:40:46.807 --> 01:40:48.104
So to hell with it.

1117
01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:50.307
Let's take Archie out.

1118
01:40:56.283 --> 01:40:57.375
You're serious.

1119
01:40:57.584 --> 01:41:00.075
l used to be a masked avenger too,
remember?

1120
01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:03.417
l'm used to going out at 3 in the morning
and doing something stupid.

1121
01:42:05.419 --> 01:42:07.250
Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.

1122
01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:10.015
Tenement fire at 5th and Grand.
Rapid burner.

1123
01:42:10.157 --> 01:42:11.522
Let's go.

1124
01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:18.662
l can see it.
All right, hold on.

1125
01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:30.940
Dan, there are kids in there.

1126
01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:33.272
Everyone, stay where you are
and remain calm.

1127
01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:35.642
We're gonna get you out of there.

1128
01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:37.976
The roof's starting to cave.
Get me in there.

1129
01:42:38.152 --> 01:42:39.642
l'm gonna get you close.

1130
01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:39.743
Let's go.

1131
01:43:39.947 --> 01:43:42.040
Watch your step.
All right.

1132
01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:45.442
We're all set.

1133
01:43:46.453 --> 01:43:48.148
ls that everyone?

1134
01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:14.944
Bye.
Bye!

1135
01:44:18.552 --> 01:44:20.110
l can't believe we did that.

1136
01:44:22.122 --> 01:44:24.556
- They'll lock us up with Rorschach.
- Who cares?

1137
01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:26.726
World War lll could start tomorrow.

1138
01:44:28.829 --> 01:44:30.160
Right?

1139
01:44:31.832 --> 01:44:33.163
Right.

1140
01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:41.726
Come back here!

1141
01:46:44.331 --> 01:46:46.026
He's dead, Rorschach.

1142
01:46:46.166 --> 01:46:50.364
While everyone's distracted, we thought
we'd bring you a housewarming gift.

1143
01:46:50.537 --> 01:46:52.732
Something from the machine shop.

1144
01:46:54.341 --> 01:46:55.933
Hey, boss, you notice?

1145
01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:59.135
None of that "small world,
tall order" crap.

1146
01:46:59.346 --> 01:47:02.474
He knows once we slice open his lock,
he's next on the block.

1147
01:47:02.916 --> 01:47:04.076
Fat chance.

1148
01:47:04.785 --> 01:47:05.877
You're dead, Rorschach!

1149
01:47:06.086 --> 01:47:09.715
We got a prison full of killers out here.
What do you got?

1150
01:47:12.692 --> 01:47:15.126
Your hands, my pleasure.

1151
01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:19.098
Can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?

1152
01:47:19.299 --> 01:47:22.598
This riot won't last.
I've been waiting 15 years for this.

1153
01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:27.104
l'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way
of my revenge.

1154
01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:32.540
Nothing personal, big guy.

1155
01:47:34.014 --> 01:47:36.005
Boss! Wait!

1156
01:47:49.329 --> 01:47:51.126
Now you find out what the score is.

1157
01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:54.659
one-nothing. Come and get me.

1158
01:48:00.674 --> 01:48:02.301
Come on.

1159
01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:04.103
So l've been thinking.

1160
01:48:04.978 --> 01:48:09.176
l feel that we have an obligation
to our fraternity.

1161
01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:13.077
- I think we ought to spring Rorschach.
What?

1162
01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:14.983
Someone set him up.

1163
01:48:15.822 --> 01:48:19.417
And this whole cancer thing with Jon,
it just doesn't make sense.

1164
01:48:19.626 --> 01:48:21.594
You didn't get it.

1165
01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:24.295
Yeah, but breaking
into a maximum-security prison...

1166
01:48:24.498 --> 01:48:28.127
- ... is a little different than putting out a fire.
- Yeah, you're right.

1167
01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:30.900
lt'll be more fun.

1168
01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:38.033
Hurry, Lloyd. I wanna
smell this son of a bitch cooking.

1169
01:48:43.316 --> 01:48:45.045
Yes.

1170
01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:50.812
No.

1171
01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:09.573
Never disposed of sewage
with a toilet before. obvious, really.

1172
01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:13.676
Two-nothing. Your move.

1173
01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:17.775
Get out of the way!

1174
01:49:51.451 --> 01:49:53.009
No. No.

1175
01:49:53.653 --> 01:49:55.052
Where's my face?

1176
01:49:57.624 --> 01:49:59.319
Don't kill me.

1177
01:50:03.029 --> 01:50:04.428
Your turn, doctor.

1178
01:50:04.564 --> 01:50:07.761
Tell me, what do you see?

1179
01:51:33.953 --> 01:51:35.682
Don't move!

1180
01:51:43.963 --> 01:51:45.760
Rorschach.

1181
01:51:46.266 --> 01:51:49.064
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.

1182
01:51:49.202 --> 01:51:52.603
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.

1183
01:51:53.173 --> 01:51:55.107
Oh, for chrissake.

1184
01:52:55.969 --> 01:52:58.062
Are you all right?

1185
01:52:59.506 --> 01:53:01.633
Yeah. Just...

1186
01:53:02.108 --> 01:53:03.336
...heavy, you know?

1187
01:53:04.144 --> 01:53:06.237
War, jailbreak.

1188
01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:11.716
Don't worry about it. okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

1189
01:53:16.723 --> 01:53:19.715
- Hello, Laurie.
- Jon.

1190
01:53:19.926 --> 01:53:23.521
- TV said you were on Mars.
- I am on Mars.

1191
01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:26.530
You and I are about
to have a conversation there.

1192
01:53:26.666 --> 01:53:28.133
What are you talking about?

1193
01:53:28.334 --> 01:53:30.962
You're going to try to convince me
to save the world.

1194
01:53:36.876 --> 01:53:39.868
- Laurie, don't.
- Dan, trust me.

1195
01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:41.741
l have to go.

1196
01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:49.387
Beautiful, isn't it?

1197
01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:57.195
Forgive me. These things sometimes
slip my mind.

1198
01:53:58.598 --> 01:54:00.395
lt won't happen again.

1199
01:54:02.035 --> 01:54:04.026
That's comforting.

1200
01:54:06.406 --> 01:54:08.033
Oh, my God.

1201
01:54:08.708 --> 01:54:10.539
l'm on Mars.

1202
01:54:12.045 --> 01:54:16.414
We need to hit up
underworld contacts, squee<i>z</i>e people.

1203
01:54:16.616 --> 01:54:19.312
Sure, why don't we just pick names
out of a phone book?

1204
01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:21.612
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.

1205
01:54:21.821 --> 01:54:26.258
You've gone too soft. Too trusting.
Especially with women.

1206
01:54:26.426 --> 01:54:28.519
okay, no. Listen, l've had it with that.

1207
01:54:28.728 --> 01:54:30.719
God, who do you
think you are, Rorschach?

1208
01:54:30.930 --> 01:54:33.023
You live off people
while insulting them...

1209
01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:36.966
...and no one complains because they think
you're a goddamn lunatic.

1210
01:54:48.982 --> 01:54:50.779
l'm sorry.

1211
01:54:53.486 --> 01:54:55.647
l shouldn't have said that, man.

1212
01:54:57.657 --> 01:54:58.988
Daniel...

1213
01:55:00.426 --> 01:55:02.894
...you are a good friend.

1214
01:55:05.798 --> 01:55:08.926
l know it can be difficult
with me sometimes.

1215
01:55:15.441 --> 01:55:16.931
Forget it.

1216
01:55:18.111 --> 01:55:19.806
lt's okay, man.

1217
01:55:21.047 --> 01:55:22.639
Let's do it your way.

1218
01:55:41.734 --> 01:55:43.031
Oh, God.

1219
01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:47.570
Pyramid Transnational.
Anyone heard of it?

1220
01:55:55.081 --> 01:55:56.548
Oh, you bastards.

1221
01:55:56.749 --> 01:55:59.843
l buy everyone a round
and you sell me out like this?

1222
01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:04.286
Back off, or l'll stick this glass
in your squidgy face.

1223
01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:08.927
Everybody stay calm.
We'll try to keep this brief.

1224
01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:11.393
Roy Chess. on Pyramid payroll.

1225
01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:16.091
Tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now.
Did you know him?

1226
01:56:16.235 --> 01:56:17.930
No.

1227
01:56:19.305 --> 01:56:20.533
Yeah, yeah!

1228
01:56:20.707 --> 01:56:23.642
- I hired him. I knew him from the inside.
- You're a felon.

1229
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:26.802
l was. l've been straight
ever since I got out, I swear.

1230
01:56:26.946 --> 01:56:30.712
l barely knew Chess that well,
but I was told to hire from the old life.

1231
01:56:30.917 --> 01:56:34.444
- Told by whom?
- My contact, Miss Slater.

1232
01:56:34.654 --> 01:56:37.248
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?

1233
01:56:37.423 --> 01:56:41.416
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring
ex-cons was part of the company program.

1234
01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:45.258
Give people a second chance.
God, please let go! l'm telling the truth!

1235
01:56:49.435 --> 01:56:52.632
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.

1236
01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:55.535
Adrian might help us
find out who's underwriting Pyramid.

1237
01:56:55.675 --> 01:56:57.142
Follow the money.

1238
01:56:59.579 --> 01:57:02.673
This is where we hold our conversation.

1239
01:57:03.483 --> 01:57:08.477
ln it, you ask me
to stop the imminent nuclear war.

1240
01:57:09.088 --> 01:57:11.716
But why would I save a world...

1241
01:57:11.891 --> 01:57:14.189
...l no longer have any stake in?

1242
01:57:16.295 --> 01:57:18.320
Then do it for me.

1243
01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:20.597
lf you really care.

1244
01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:24.201
When you left me, I left Earth.

1245
01:57:24.404 --> 01:57:27.305
Does that not show you that I care?

1246
01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:33.411
My red world here, now...

1247
01:57:34.447 --> 01:57:37.348
...means more to me than your blue one.

1248
01:57:38.117 --> 01:57:39.812
Let me show you.

1249
01:57:57.970 --> 01:58:00.871
Bombers are fueled and ready, sir.

1250
01:58:10.216 --> 01:58:12.411
lt's time, gentlemen.

1251
01:58:14.587 --> 01:58:16.987
Take us to DEFCoN one.

1252
01:58:22.328 --> 01:58:25.422
Not in penthouse. Not in office.

1253
01:58:25.598 --> 01:58:28.499
What nocturnal proclivities
entice a man with everything...

1254
01:58:28.701 --> 01:58:30.430
...out into the night at this hour?

1255
01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:32.400
l'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.

1256
01:58:32.538 --> 01:58:35.302
Maybe he keeps on file.

1257
01:58:40.012 --> 01:58:42.446
- Something's not right.
- Agreed.

1258
01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:47.415
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess
all work for Pyramid.

1259
01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:52.216
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list
with his and Slater's name on it.

1260
01:58:52.425 --> 01:58:55.724
Whoever owns Pyramid
could be giving these people cancer.

1261
01:58:55.862 --> 01:58:58.330
Setting Manhattan up.

1262
01:59:12.411 --> 01:59:13.571
Funny.

1263
01:59:13.779 --> 01:59:17.271
Ancient pharaohs looked forward
to the end of the world.

1264
01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:22.477
Believed cadavers would rise,
reclaim hearts from golden jars.

1265
01:59:23.122 --> 01:59:25.784
Must currently be holding breath
in anticipation.

1266
01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:27.187
Pharaohs?

1267
01:59:34.033 --> 01:59:36.092
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.

1268
01:59:36.702 --> 01:59:39.193
See what the corporate head-peepers say.

1269
01:59:41.207 --> 01:59:43.732
"Subject continues
to retreat emotionally.

1270
01:59:46.045 --> 01:59:49.105
lf the only remaining ties
were to be severed...

1271
01:59:49.749 --> 01:59:53.708
...we predict total detachment
from the human condition."

1272
01:59:57.823 --> 01:59:59.620
l'm in.

1273
02:00:28.487 --> 02:00:29.852
No.

1274
02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:37.759
Congratulations, Mr. Veidt.
Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.

1275
02:00:37.964 --> 02:00:41.798
Your support and your enthusiasm...

1276
02:00:41.968 --> 02:00:44.266
...is what has led to this triumph.

1277
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:48.463
on behalf of the research team,
we salute you.

1278
02:00:48.674 --> 02:00:51.074
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1279
02:00:51.877 --> 02:00:55.973
What in life
does not deserve celebrating?

1280
02:00:56.983 --> 02:01:00.942
This is the new Karnak.

1281
02:01:01.153 --> 02:01:04.748
This represents the culmination of a dream
more than 2000 years old...

1282
02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:11.227
...a dream now assured
because of your unquestioning assistance.

1283
02:01:13.332 --> 02:01:15.027
And for this...

1284
02:01:15.835 --> 02:01:18.167
...l am ashamed...

1285
02:01:19.338 --> 02:01:23.672
...ashamed that you must now share
such inadequate a reward.

1286
02:01:25.344 --> 02:01:27.335
To the pharaohs...

1287
02:01:28.281 --> 02:01:31.273
...their greatest secrets
entrusted to their servants...

1288
02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:36.285
...buried alive with them
in sand-floored chambers.

1289
02:01:37.156 --> 02:01:39.556
Sleep well, gentlemen.

1290
02:01:40.259 --> 02:01:43.558
our new, peaceful world
will be indebted...

1291
02:01:43.896 --> 02:01:46.456
...to your great sacrifice.

1292
02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.595
Bubastis.

1293
02:01:53.773 --> 02:01:56.765
Rorschach's journal. Final entry.

1294
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:59.600
Veidt's behind everything.

1295
02:01:59.779 --> 02:02:01.303
Why?

1296
02:02:01.514 --> 02:02:03.539
What's his endgame?

1297
02:02:03.749 --> 02:02:07.412
l cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent.

1298
02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:11.056
Used to joke he was fast enough
to catch a bullet.

1299
02:02:11.223 --> 02:02:14.124
He could kill us both alone in the snow.

1300
02:02:14.327 --> 02:02:18.024
That's where we're going now:
Antarctica.

1301
02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:20.928
Whether l'm alive or dead
upon this reading...

1302
02:02:21.133 --> 02:02:25.365
...l hope the world survives long enough
for this journal to reach you.

1303
02:02:25.538 --> 02:02:28.132
l live my life free of compromise...

1304
02:02:28.274 --> 02:02:32.233
...and step into the shadow
without complaint or regret.

1305
02:02:32.845 --> 02:02:35.837
Rorschach, November 1st.

1306
02:02:36.048 --> 02:02:39.540
Can't you just tell me how
this ends and save us the trouble?

1307
02:02:40.553 --> 02:02:42.453
lt ends with you in tears.

1308
02:02:42.655 --> 02:02:46.250
Tears? So you don't come back to Earth.

1309
02:02:46.392 --> 02:02:49.850
At some point, yes.

1310
02:02:50.896 --> 02:02:53.865
The streets are filled with death.

1311
02:02:53.999 --> 02:02:56.058
Jon, please.

1312
02:02:56.268 --> 02:03:00.728
You have to stop this. Everyone will die.

1313
02:03:00.906 --> 02:03:05.240
And the universe will not even notice.

1314
02:03:07.713 --> 02:03:11.911
ln my opinion, the existence of life...

1315
02:03:12.818 --> 02:03:15.810
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.

1316
02:03:17.723 --> 02:03:20.021
Just look around you.

1317
02:03:22.762 --> 02:03:27.131
Mars gets along perfectly well
without so much as a microorganism.

1318
02:03:27.733 --> 02:03:32.329
Here, it's a constantly changing
topographical map...

1319
02:03:32.471 --> 02:03:38.432
...flowing and shifting around the pole
in ripples 10,000 years wide.

1320
02:03:39.245 --> 02:03:40.735
So tell me...

1321
02:03:40.946 --> 02:03:45.349
...how would all of this be greatly improved
by an oil pipeline?

1322
02:03:45.785 --> 02:03:47.753
By a shopping mall?

1323
02:03:52.158 --> 02:03:56.458
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?

1324
02:03:56.595 --> 02:03:58.756
Miracles, by their definition,
are meaningless.

1325
02:03:58.898 --> 02:04:00.331
Oh, God, Jon!

1326
02:04:00.499 --> 02:04:05.596
- only what can happen does happen.
- Just stop your bullshit.

1327
02:04:06.639 --> 02:04:09.199
Land this thing. Now.

1328
02:04:09.341 --> 02:04:11.901
JoN:
As you wish.

1329
02:04:17.550 --> 02:04:18.608
You know what?

1330
02:04:18.818 --> 02:04:21.446
You can send me back to Earth
to fry with Dan and my mom...

1331
02:04:21.654 --> 02:04:24.020
...and all the other worthless humans.

1332
02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:27.624
But know that you were wrong.
You said this ended with me in tears...

1333
02:04:27.827 --> 02:04:31.957
...and look: nothing.
Maybe you were wrong about everything.

1334
02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:37.433
You complain that I refuse to see life
on life's terms...

1335
02:04:38.137 --> 02:04:41.937
...yet you continuously refuse
to see things from my perspective.

1336
02:04:42.074 --> 02:04:46.477
- You shut out what you're afraid of.
- l'm not afraid.

1337
02:04:46.645 --> 02:04:51.673
You want me to see things your way?
Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.

1338
02:04:58.858 --> 02:05:03.886
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
l was a hero, goddamn it!

1339
02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:07.122
lt's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

1340
02:05:07.299 --> 02:05:09.426
l put food on the table
for you and your child.

1341
02:05:09.602 --> 02:05:12.400
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

1342
02:05:13.138 --> 02:05:15.834
Even the grimy parts of it...

1343
02:05:16.208 --> 02:05:18.438
...keep on getting brighter.

1344
02:05:18.811 --> 02:05:20.608
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

1345
02:05:21.514 --> 02:05:23.311
You're the Comedian, right?

1346
02:05:24.116 --> 02:05:25.811
You were pretty cool in there.

1347
02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:29.813
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

1348
02:05:30.022 --> 02:05:34.425
- You got her eyes, you know. You got-
- Take your hands off her.

1349
02:05:34.627 --> 02:05:36.720
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1350
02:05:36.929 --> 02:05:39.659
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

1351
02:05:40.165 --> 02:05:42.030
Now.

1352
02:05:43.035 --> 02:05:45.026
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1353
02:05:45.170 --> 02:05:49.038
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

1354
02:05:49.742 --> 02:05:51.437
...you know, old friend's daughter?

1355
02:05:53.746 --> 02:05:55.043
Drive.

1356
02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:03.818
lt was a mistake. One time.

1357
02:06:04.123 --> 02:06:07.286
Guy tries to rape you, and years later,
you let him finish the job?

1358
02:06:07.526 --> 02:06:10.222
What? Were you drunk or just lonely?

1359
02:06:10.396 --> 02:06:13.331
Am I ever gonna live this down?

1360
02:06:16.702 --> 02:06:17.828
Laurie.

1361
02:06:22.708 --> 02:06:24.039
No.

1362
02:06:26.045 --> 02:06:28.536
No, not him.

1363
02:06:28.747 --> 02:06:30.806
The Comedian...

1364
02:06:31.250 --> 02:06:33.309
...was your father.

1365
02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.515
No.

1366
02:06:39.825 --> 02:06:45.525
No! No! No!

1367
02:07:18.097 --> 02:07:20.088
My life is just...

1368
02:07:20.799 --> 02:07:22.892
...one big joke.

1369
02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:25.627
l don't think your life is a joke.

1370
02:07:27.306 --> 02:07:29.297
Yeah, well...

1371
02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:35.308
...l'm sorry if I don't
trust your sense of humor.

1372
02:07:43.522 --> 02:07:45.149
Will you smile...

1373
02:07:46.825 --> 02:07:49.316
...if I admit I was wrong?

1374
02:07:52.164 --> 02:07:54.155
About what?

1375
02:07:56.168 --> 02:07:57.658
Miracles.

1376
02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:02.466
Events with astronomical odds
of occurring...

1377
02:08:03.275 --> 02:08:05.766
...like oxygen turning into gold.

1378
02:08:05.978 --> 02:08:10.779
l've longed to witness such an event,
and yet I neglect...

1379
02:08:11.483 --> 02:08:13.883
...that in human coupling...

1380
02:08:14.687 --> 02:08:18.521
...millions upon millions of cells
compete to create life...

1381
02:08:18.991 --> 02:08:21.789
...for generation after generation...

1382
02:08:22.695 --> 02:08:25.721
...until finally, your mother...

1383
02:08:26.098 --> 02:08:27.292
...loves a man...

1384
02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:31.528
...Edward Blake, the Comedian,
a man she has every reason to hate...

1385
02:08:31.704 --> 02:08:35.697
...and out of that contradiction,
against unfathomable odds...

1386
02:08:36.408 --> 02:08:38.308
...it's you

1387
02:08:40.012 --> 02:08:41.343
only...

1388
02:08:42.047 --> 02:08:43.514
...you.

1389
02:08:44.416 --> 02:08:45.610
That emerged.

1390
02:08:46.218 --> 02:08:50.712
To distill so specific a form...

1391
02:08:50.923 --> 02:08:53.153
...from all that chaos...

1392
02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:58.029
...is like turning air into gold.

1393
02:09:02.367 --> 02:09:04.358
A miracle.

1394
02:09:07.873 --> 02:09:09.363
And so...

1395
02:09:09.875 --> 02:09:11.672
...l was wrong.

1396
02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:17.513
Now dry your eyes, and let's go home.

1397
02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:49.103
We got a bearing on that artificial structure.
Heat signature's off the charts.

1398
02:09:50.115 --> 02:09:53.209
- Veidt.
- I don't like the way Archie's kicking.

1399
02:10:01.627 --> 02:10:04.460
- The engines.
- They're icing up. Hold onto something.

1400
02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:07.255
Daniel, you're coming in too low.

1401
02:10:10.135 --> 02:10:13.332
Don't wish to interfere,
but perhaps should pull up sharply-

1402
02:10:13.472 --> 02:10:17.431
l know! l'm trying.
l'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!

1403
02:10:44.703 --> 02:10:48.366
l'm gonna redirect the heat from
the flamethrower to speed up deicing...

1404
02:10:48.507 --> 02:10:51.374
...but it's gonna take a while
and we don't have time to wait.

1405
02:10:52.878 --> 02:10:54.368
You need something warmer.

1406
02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:57.075
Fine like this.

1407
02:11:26.545 --> 02:11:28.376
What is it, girl?

1408
02:11:30.749 --> 02:11:32.376
Mm.

1409
02:11:58.010 --> 02:12:00.240
Adrian's a pacifist.

1410
02:12:00.412 --> 02:12:05.042
He's a vegetarian, for chrissakes.
He's never killed anyone in his life.

1411
02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:06.649
Hitler was vegetarian.

1412
02:12:06.818 --> 02:12:11.312
You're squeamish, leave him to me.
We won't get second chance.

1413
02:13:22.627 --> 02:13:23.924
Gentlemen.

1414
02:13:24.429 --> 02:13:28.365
- Welcome.
- Adrian, we know everything.

1415
02:13:28.533 --> 02:13:30.330
Then what's there to discuss, Dan?

1416
02:13:30.469 --> 02:13:33.461
Plenty. You killed Comedian.

1417
02:13:33.638 --> 02:13:35.162
May he rest in peace.

1418
02:13:35.674 --> 02:13:38.268
Blake figured it out first.

1419
02:13:38.443 --> 02:13:42.539
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us,
making sure we weren't rocking the boat.

1420
02:13:43.482 --> 02:13:45.746
Blake found out what I was doing
here in Karnak...

1421
02:13:45.951 --> 02:13:49.944
...and by the time he visited poor Moloch,
he was cracking badly.

1422
02:13:50.155 --> 02:13:53.454
Even I couldn't predict he'd be the one
to have a change of heart.

1423
02:13:54.159 --> 02:13:55.683
So...

1424
02:13:56.762 --> 02:13:58.662
...l had to kill him.

1425
02:13:59.264 --> 02:14:02.927
Then I neutrali<i>z</i>ed Jon. No easy task.

1426
02:14:03.101 --> 02:14:05.592
l put roughly $2 billion
into tachyon research...

1427
02:14:05.737 --> 02:14:07.796
...to block Jon's vision of the future.

1428
02:14:07.939 --> 02:14:10.203
You used his psych profile
to manipulate him.

1429
02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:12.199
Got him to leave the planet.

1430
02:14:12.344 --> 02:14:15.745
l've known Jon long enough
to see he isn't devoid of emotion.

1431
02:14:15.947 --> 02:14:19.849
His subtle facial twitches wouldn't be
noticed by the layman, but to me...

1432
02:14:20.018 --> 02:14:21.849
...he might as well have been sobbing.

1433
02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:25.348
All I needed to do was tug on the thread.

1434
02:14:25.524 --> 02:14:27.424
The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...

1435
02:14:27.626 --> 02:14:31.221
...when he came to believe
he'd given cancer to the people he loved...

1436
02:14:31.363 --> 02:14:33.524
...was all the excuse he needed
to leave Earth.

1437
02:14:33.665 --> 02:14:37.533
Your bullshit assassin.
You paid him to throw us off.

1438
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:42.333
Mr. Chess gave his life
in the service of a higher cause, Dan.

1439
02:14:44.476 --> 02:14:47.570
l put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...

1440
02:14:47.746 --> 02:14:50.340
...leaving only one loose end:

1441
02:14:50.982 --> 02:14:54.440
You, and your mask-killer theory...

1442
02:14:54.586 --> 02:14:57.680
...one you followed
with the tenacity of a true sociopath.

1443
02:14:57.889 --> 02:14:59.584
l tipped off the police.

1444
02:14:59.758 --> 02:15:02.090
once you were in prison,
l was able to move forward.

1445
02:15:02.294 --> 02:15:04.888
Sorry to disappoint you.

1446
02:15:18.110 --> 02:15:20.544
We were supposed to make the world
a better place.

1447
02:15:20.712 --> 02:15:22.441
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.

1448
02:15:22.647 --> 02:15:23.944
Nuclear war?

1449
02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:26.310
Human extinction?

1450
02:15:35.961 --> 02:15:40.864
of course, my moral safeguards
gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.

1451
02:15:41.032 --> 02:15:44.024
A few key regions around the globe-

1452
02:15:44.169 --> 02:15:49.630
New York, Los Angeles, Moscow,
Hong Kong.

1453
02:15:49.841 --> 02:15:51.468
- disintegrated in an instant.

1454
02:15:52.244 --> 02:15:55.543
Fifteen million people killed...

1455
02:15:55.747 --> 02:15:57.772
...by Dr. Manhattan himself.

1456
02:15:59.050 --> 02:16:01.780
The world's punishment
for flirting with World War lll.

1457
02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:03.012
Jon wouldn't do that.

1458
02:16:03.622 --> 02:16:06.318
A fact no one outside this room
ever has to know.

1459
02:16:06.992 --> 02:16:10.792
The energy breakthrough I was working on
just came to fruition.

1460
02:16:11.396 --> 02:16:15.389
All these years, Jon was helping me
replicate his power...

1461
02:16:15.534 --> 02:16:18.094
...unaware of how I planned to use it.

1462
02:16:18.236 --> 02:16:20.227
You see...

1463
02:16:21.139 --> 02:16:23.539
...the Comedian was right.

1464
02:16:24.242 --> 02:16:29.236
Humanity's savage nature
will inevitably lead to global annihilation.

1465
02:16:29.447 --> 02:16:32.211
So in order to save this planet...

1466
02:16:32.517 --> 02:16:34.542
...l had to trick it...

1467
02:16:34.953 --> 02:16:38.946
...with the greatest practical joke
in human history.

1468
02:16:39.257 --> 02:16:42.658
- Killing millions.
- To save billions.

1469
02:16:43.228 --> 02:16:45.162
A necessary crime.

1470
02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:47.491
You know we can't let you do that.

1471
02:16:48.934 --> 02:16:51.061
"Do that," Rorschach?

1472
02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:52.863
l'm not a comic-book villain.

1473
02:16:53.738 --> 02:16:55.968
Do you think
l'd explain my masterstroke to you...

1474
02:16:56.141 --> 02:17:00.271
...if there were even the slightest possibility
you could affect the outcome?

1475
02:17:03.014 --> 02:17:05.778
l triggered it 35 minutes ago.

1476
02:18:45.317 --> 02:18:48.309
Jesus Christ, Henry.

1477
02:18:48.486 --> 02:18:50.716
Why the hell
didn't we get a launch detection?

1478
02:18:52.624 --> 02:18:57.027
lt's not the Soviets, sir.

1479
02:18:57.629 --> 02:19:00.689
lntel indicates the energy signature...

1480
02:19:00.865 --> 02:19:03.299
...was generated by...

1481
02:19:04.269 --> 02:19:06.703
...Dr. Manhattan.

1482
02:19:09.574 --> 02:19:11.098
Jon.

1483
02:19:14.112 --> 02:19:15.272
lnterference.

1484
02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:17.780
Cataclysmic interference.

1485
02:19:27.492 --> 02:19:30.290
l can't believe it happened.

1486
02:19:31.296 --> 02:19:34.788
This wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.

1487
02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:40.134
lt was me.

1488
02:19:42.207 --> 02:19:43.799
l...

1489
02:19:44.342 --> 02:19:45.400
...did this.

1490
02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:49.468
- What do you mean, you did this?
- Not directly.

1491
02:19:50.482 --> 02:19:53.144
lt was made to look like I did it.

1492
02:19:56.221 --> 02:19:57.654
Adrian.

1493
02:20:03.928 --> 02:20:05.919
Speak of the devil.

1494
02:20:09.067 --> 02:20:10.125
Jon-
l know.

1495
02:20:10.268 --> 02:20:12.429
Must stop him.
Killed Blake, killed millions.

1496
02:20:12.637 --> 02:20:13.934
Wait here.

1497
02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:27.482
Adrian, stop this.

1498
02:20:28.953 --> 02:20:30.853
The tachyons were clever...

1499
02:20:31.956 --> 02:20:36.290
...but even if I can't predict where you are,
l can turn the walls to glass.

1500
02:20:37.662 --> 02:20:40.096
l should thank you.

1501
02:20:41.266 --> 02:20:44.463
l'd almost forgotten the excitement
of not knowing...

1502
02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:48.462
...the delights of uncertainty.

1503
02:20:52.677 --> 02:20:54.304
Forgive me, girl.

1504
02:21:17.235 --> 02:21:18.930
You're such an asshole.

1505
02:21:52.904 --> 02:21:54.872
Veidt, you bastard.

1506
02:21:55.006 --> 02:21:57.474
- lf you've hurt her, l'll-
- Dan...

1507
02:21:59.210 --> 02:22:03.738
...grow up. My new world
demands less obvious heroism.

1508
02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:05.916
Your...

1509
02:22:06.117 --> 02:22:11.054
...schoolboy heroics are redundant.
What have they achieved?

1510
02:22:12.724 --> 02:22:15.557
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation...

1511
02:22:16.528 --> 02:22:18.928
...is your only triumph.

1512
02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:21.030
JoN:
l'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

1513
02:22:21.833 --> 02:22:25.325
l'm very disappointed.

1514
02:22:37.749 --> 02:22:40.877
Reassembling myself
was the first trick I learned.

1515
02:22:41.586 --> 02:22:43.986
lt didn't kill osterman.

1516
02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:48.957
Did you really think it would kill me?

1517
02:22:50.261 --> 02:22:53.458
l have walked across the surface
of the sun.

1518
02:22:53.965 --> 02:22:57.093
l have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast...

1519
02:22:57.268 --> 02:23:00.294
...they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all...

1520
02:23:00.438 --> 02:23:04.101
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.

1521
02:23:05.209 --> 02:23:07.700
The world's smartest man...

1522
02:23:07.912 --> 02:23:10.437
...poses no more threat to me...

1523
02:23:10.648 --> 02:23:13.742
...than does its smartest termite.

1524
02:23:16.054 --> 02:23:17.521
What's that?

1525
02:23:17.922 --> 02:23:19.822
Another ultimate weapon?

1526
02:23:20.425 --> 02:23:22.154
Yes.

1527
02:23:23.761 --> 02:23:25.228
You could say that.

1528
02:23:28.766 --> 02:23:30.734
- came under attack.

1529
02:23:31.536 --> 02:23:34.869
Millions of lives were suddenly ended...

1530
02:23:35.239 --> 02:23:40.438
...in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.

1531
02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:46.182
Since the attacks,
l have been in constant contact...

1532
02:23:46.351 --> 02:23:49.343
...with the premier of the U.S.S.R.

1533
02:23:49.754 --> 02:23:52.587
Putting aside our past differences...

1534
02:23:52.957 --> 02:23:55.084
...we have both pledged to unite...

1535
02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:58.759
...against this common enemy.

1536
02:23:59.263 --> 02:24:01.197
With the rest of the world...

1537
02:24:01.633 --> 02:24:03.692
...we will prevail.

1538
02:24:06.204 --> 02:24:09.196
This is a day we shall never forget.

1539
02:24:09.407 --> 02:24:13.605
And yet we go forward
to defend the human race...

1540
02:24:13.745 --> 02:24:18.409
...and all that is good
and just in our world.

1541
02:24:19.751 --> 02:24:23.983
Thank you. God bless us all.

1542
02:24:24.355 --> 02:24:26.152
Do you see?

1543
02:24:28.359 --> 02:24:30.827
Two superpowers retreating from war.

1544
02:24:32.430 --> 02:24:34.864
l've saved the earth from hell.

1545
02:24:35.033 --> 02:24:37.001
We both have.

1546
02:24:37.468 --> 02:24:39.663
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

1547
02:24:44.475 --> 02:24:45.965
Now we can return...

1548
02:24:47.445 --> 02:24:48.969
...do what we were meant to.

1549
02:24:49.147 --> 02:24:52.139
We were meant to exact justice.

1550
02:24:52.483 --> 02:24:55.850
- Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
- Will they?

1551
02:24:55.987 --> 02:25:00.720
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

1552
02:25:00.892 --> 02:25:04.328
- Peace based on a lie.
- But peace...

1553
02:25:04.495 --> 02:25:06.690
- ... nonetheless.
- He's right.

1554
02:25:07.298 --> 02:25:11.234
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world
to nuclear destruction again.

1555
02:25:11.402 --> 02:25:14.303
No. We can't do this.

1556
02:25:14.439 --> 02:25:16.202
on Mars...

1557
02:25:17.709 --> 02:25:19.540
...you taught me the value of life.

1558
02:25:20.511 --> 02:25:22.945
lf we hope to preserve it here...

1559
02:25:23.815 --> 02:25:25.806
...we must remain silent.

1560
02:25:29.654 --> 02:25:31.622
Keep your own secrets.

1561
02:25:38.463 --> 02:25:39.657
Don't even think about it.

1562
02:25:42.266 --> 02:25:44.029
Rorschach.

1563
02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:47.328
Wait.

1564
02:25:48.339 --> 02:25:50.432
Never compromise.

1565
02:25:50.842 --> 02:25:53.675
Not even in the face of armageddon.

1566
02:25:54.078 --> 02:25:57.070
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

1567
02:26:08.092 --> 02:26:11.619
l've made myself feel every death...

1568
02:26:13.097 --> 02:26:19.002
...see every innocent face
l've murdered to save humanity.

1569
02:26:24.609 --> 02:26:28.306
- You understand, don't you?
JoN: Without condoning...

1570
02:26:29.947 --> 02:26:31.847
...or condemning...

1571
02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:38.220
...l understand.

1572
02:26:45.630 --> 02:26:48.758
out of my way. People have to be told.

1573
02:26:49.634 --> 02:26:51.568
You know I can't let you do that.

1574
02:26:52.837 --> 02:26:55.829
Suddenly you discover humanity?

1575
02:26:57.241 --> 02:26:59.072
Convenient.

1576
02:27:07.785 --> 02:27:12.313
lf you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

1577
02:27:16.093 --> 02:27:19.085
l can change almost anything...

1578
02:27:23.634 --> 02:27:26.000
...but I can't change human nature.

1579
02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:30.706
of course
you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

1580
02:27:32.009 --> 02:27:35.308
What's one more body
amongst foundations?

1581
02:27:41.519 --> 02:27:43.419
Well, what are you waiting for?

1582
02:27:46.858 --> 02:27:48.723
Do it.

1583
02:27:54.832 --> 02:27:55.821
Do it!

1584
02:27:58.536 --> 02:28:01.869
No!

1585
02:28:19.390 --> 02:28:25.124
l'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.

1586
02:28:25.296 --> 02:28:27.787
l thought you said you cared
about life again.

1587
02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:29.398
l do.

1588
02:28:30.701 --> 02:28:33.602
l think maybe l'll create some.

1589
02:28:37.708 --> 02:28:40.040
Goodbye, Laurie.

1590
02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:16.405
Come on.

1591
02:29:18.916 --> 02:29:20.474
Come on!

1592
02:29:24.922 --> 02:29:26.287
Dan...

1593
02:29:26.724 --> 02:29:29.488
...a world united and at peace.

1594
02:29:30.394 --> 02:29:31.588
There had to be sacrifice.

1595
02:29:31.729 --> 02:29:36.098
No! You haven't ideali<i>z</i>ed mankind,
you've deformed it.

1596
02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:38.029
You've mutilated it.

1597
02:29:38.402 --> 02:29:40.597
That's your legacy.

1598
02:29:49.113 --> 02:29:51.911
That's the real practical joke.

1599
02:30:44.568 --> 02:30:48.561
We repeat, there is
nothing wrong with your television set.

1600
02:30:48.773 --> 02:30:52.209
You are about to participate
in a great adventure.

1601
02:30:52.376 --> 02:30:55.573
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery...

1602
02:30:55.713 --> 02:31:01.515
...which reaches from the inner mind
to the outer limits.

1603
02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:04.915
Sure you don't want a drink?

1604
02:31:05.923 --> 02:31:06.912
l'm okay.

1605
02:31:08.025 --> 02:31:09.219
Cheers.

1606
02:31:10.661 --> 02:31:13.824
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

1607
02:31:15.066 --> 02:31:17.557
l know that Eddie Blake was my father.

1608
02:31:20.571 --> 02:31:22.334
Laurel.

1609
02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:25.672
What you must think of me.

1610
02:31:26.544 --> 02:31:29.035
l'm sorry I never told you.

1611
02:31:29.246 --> 02:31:31.043
l should have...

1612
02:31:31.248 --> 02:31:35.344
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed.
l felt stupid.

1613
02:31:35.553 --> 02:31:37.453
lt doesn't matter.

1614
02:31:38.289 --> 02:31:43.556
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things...

1615
02:31:44.161 --> 02:31:47.062
...and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

1616
02:31:47.264 --> 02:31:49.562
l know how that is...

1617
02:31:50.301 --> 02:31:52.895
...but I just want you to know...

1618
02:31:53.471 --> 02:31:56.304
...that you never did anything wrong
by me.

1619
02:32:00.411 --> 02:32:04.711
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

1620
02:32:06.317 --> 02:32:08.751
Because he gave me you.

1621
02:32:13.824 --> 02:32:14.916
Thanks, Mom.

1622
02:32:17.628 --> 02:32:19.425
l love you.

1623
02:32:26.971 --> 02:32:31.169
- Hello, Miss Jupiter.
- Oh, Sally, please.

1624
02:32:32.843 --> 02:32:37.439
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
l'll be right back.

1625
02:32:47.958 --> 02:32:52.156
- So how's it going up here?
- Good. How's it going down there?

1626
02:32:52.296 --> 02:32:55.788
Good. I think l've got everything working.

1627
02:32:55.966 --> 02:33:00.528
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now...

1628
02:33:00.704 --> 02:33:02.934
...so all we gotta do is take her out.

1629
02:33:03.107 --> 02:33:06.201
Well, that sounds like a date.

1630
02:33:17.521 --> 02:33:19.819
Are we gonna be all right?

1631
02:33:21.859 --> 02:33:26.159
Long as people think Jon's
still watching us, we'll be all right...

1632
02:33:26.363 --> 02:33:28.228
...in the end.

1633
02:33:29.867 --> 02:33:32.028
l know what Jon would say:

1634
02:33:32.236 --> 02:33:34.227
Nothing ends.

1635
02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:38.734
Nothing ever ends.

1636
02:34:26.123 --> 02:34:29.854
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

1637
02:34:30.027 --> 02:34:31.426
Everyone in the country...

1638
02:34:31.562 --> 02:34:33.826
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

1639
02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:37.262
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

1640
02:34:37.768 --> 02:34:40.635
lt's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

1641
02:34:40.838 --> 02:34:44.740
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

1642
02:34:44.942 --> 02:34:46.739
We could run a piece on that.

1643
02:34:46.944 --> 02:34:50.072
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

1644
02:34:50.281 --> 02:34:54.149
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

1645
02:34:54.852 --> 02:34:59.084
Okay. I could look for something
in the crank file.

1646
02:34:59.256 --> 02:35:00.780
Crank file.

1647
02:35:00.991 --> 02:35:02.982
Whatever. Take some initiative.

1648
02:35:03.127 --> 02:35:05.789
Run whatever you like.
l leave it entirely in your hands.

1649
02:35:12.303 --> 02:35:17.002
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

1650
02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:21.601
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.
