1
00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:06.228
No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

2
00:02:06.296 --> 00:02:08.184
I'm lost!
Where's the line?

3
00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.118
<i>It just went away.
What do I do?</i>

4
00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:13.136
- Help!
- We'll be stuck here forever!

5
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.478
Do not panic.
Do not panic!

6
00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:18.928
We are trained professionals.
Now, stay calm.

7
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:21.074
We are going around the leaf.

8
00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:23.864
A- Around the leaf?
I don't think we can do that.

9
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:27.641
Oh, nonsense. This is nothing
compared to the twig of '93.

10
00:02:27.707 --> 00:02:31.384
That's it. That's it. Good!

11
00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:34.965
You're doing great!
There you go. There you go!

12
00:02:35.036 --> 00:02:37.141
Watch my eyes.
Don't look away.

13
00:02:37.212 --> 00:02:41.010
- And here's the line again.
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Soil.

14
00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:43.955
Good job, everybody!

15
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.364
<i>Oh, my.
There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil.</i>

16
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.659
- Shouldn't we tell the queen?
- I don't think we need to involve the queen in this.

17
00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:53.272
She's got enough on her plate already,
training her daughter.

18
00:02:53.342 --> 00:02:57.085
Oh, yes.
Princess Atta, the poor dear.

19
00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:00.665
Oh, wind's died down.
They'll be here soon.

20
00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:04.478
- Just be confident, dear. You'll be fine.
- There's a gap.

21
00:03:04.544 --> 00:03:07.359
<i>There's a gap in the line.
What are we gonna do?</i>

22
00:03:07.424 --> 00:03:10.808
It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen.
We just lost a few inches, that's all.

23
00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:12.735
Oh. Right.

24
00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:16.635
Your Highness, I can't count
when you hover like that.

25
00:03:16.705 --> 00:03:18.560
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

26
00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.114
Guys, go shade
someone else for a while.

27
00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:23.258
Okay, Atta.
Now what do we do?

28
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.422
Ahh... Oh! Don't tell me.
I know it. What is it?

29
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:29.825
<i>- We relax.
- Right.</i>

30
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.153
Oh, it'll be fine.
It's the same, year after year.

31
00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.318
They come, they eat, they leave.
That's our lot in life.

32
00:03:36.388 --> 00:03:38.723
It's not a lot, but it's our life.

33
00:03:40.228 --> 00:03:43.229
Isn't that right, Aphie?
Oh, you're such a cute little aphid.

34
00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:47.011
- Ditch Dot!
- Yeah, yeah!

35
00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:49.248
Hey, come back here!

36
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:52.997
<i>- Dot!
- Yes, Mother.</i>

37
00:03:53.062 --> 00:03:55.485
What did I tell you
about trying to fly?

38
00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:57.762
Not until my wings grow in.

39
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.686
<i>- Right.
- But Mom...</i>

40
00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:02.402
Dot, you're a young queen ant
and your wings are too little...

41
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:05.887
I was talking to Mother.
You're not the queen yet, Atta.

42
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.381
Now, Dot,
be nice to your sister.

43
00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:10.595
<i>It's not my fault
she's so stressed out.</i>

44
00:04:10.664 --> 00:04:12.704
I know, I know.

45
00:04:12.777 --> 00:04:15.974
<i>- I'm always acting like the sky is falling.
- Look out!</i>

46
00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:18.594
- Atta!
- Princess Atta!

47
00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:37.154
- Oh!
- Hey!

48
00:04:37.228 --> 00:04:40.130
<i>- Stop that!
- What do you think you're doing?</i>

49
00:04:40.204 --> 00:04:42.855
- You could have killed somebody over here.
- I'm sorry!

50
00:04:42.924 --> 00:04:45.706
- Oh, it's Flik.
- Oh...

51
00:04:45.773 --> 00:04:47.813
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

52
00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:50.024
Please forgive me. I'm sorry!

53
00:04:50.093 --> 00:04:52.908
- Princess Atta!
- Flik, what are you doing?

54
00:04:52.974 --> 00:04:55.973
Oh, this! This is my new idea
for harvesting grain.

55
00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:59.145
No more picking individual kernels.
You cut down the entire stalk!

56
00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:03.525
- We don't have time for this.
- Exactly! We never have time to collect food for ourselves.

57
00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.606
We spend all summer
harvesting for the offering.

58
00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:09.871
<i>- But my invention will speed up production.
- Oh, another invention?</i>

59
00:05:09.936 --> 00:05:11.791
Something for you too.

60
00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:13.864
Since you're gonna be queen, you could
use this to oversee production.

61
00:05:13.937 --> 00:05:17.253
<i>- Dr. Flora, if I may.
- This is all very nice, but...</i>

62
00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:20.559
- Just an ordinary blade of grass and a bead of dew, right?
- Flik, please.

63
00:05:20.626 --> 00:05:24.969
Wrong! It is, in fact, a telescope.

64
00:05:25.042 --> 00:05:28.489
- It's very clever, Flik, but...
- Hello, Princess! Aren't you looking lovely this morning!

65
00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:31.246
Not that you would need
a telescope to see that.

66
00:05:31.315 --> 00:05:35.025
Listen! The princess doesn't
have time for this!

67
00:05:35.092 --> 00:05:37.066
You wanna help fill this thing?
Get rid of that machine,

68
00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.369
get back in line and pick grain
like everybody else!

69
00:05:40.436 --> 00:05:43.403
- Like everybody else!
- Please, Flik. Just go.

70
00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.550
I'm sorry,
I was really just trying...

71
00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:48.435
trying to help.

72
00:05:51.477 --> 00:05:56.780
<i>Harvester. Why, we harvested
the same way ever since I was a pupa.</i>

73
00:05:56.854 --> 00:05:59.221
Where were we?

74
00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:01.327
<i>- The food pile, Your Highness.
- Oh, yes, yes.</i>

75
00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:03.984
Hey, Flik! Wait up!

76
00:06:04.054 --> 00:06:05.909
Oh. Hello, Princess.

77
00:06:05.974 --> 00:06:08.430
You can call me Dot.
Here, you forgot this.

78
00:06:08.503 --> 00:06:11.121
Thanks. You can keep it.
I can make another one.

79
00:06:11.191 --> 00:06:15.348
- I like your inventions.
- Really? Well, you're the first.

80
00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:18.995
- I'm beginning to think nothing I do works.
- This works.

81
00:06:19.064 --> 00:06:21.105
Great. One success.

82
00:06:21.178 --> 00:06:23.895
- I'm never gonna make a difference.
- Me, neither.

83
00:06:23.962 --> 00:06:27.541
I'm a royal ant and I can't
even fly yet. I'm too little.

84
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.425
- Being little's not such a bad thing.
- Yes, it is.

85
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.952
- No, it's not.
- Is too!

86
00:06:32.027 --> 00:06:34.777
- Is not. Is not! Is not!
- Is too. Is too! Is too!

87
00:06:34.843 --> 00:06:38.226
Oh! A seed.
I need a seed. Ahh...

88
00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:44.667
Ohh!

89
00:06:44.732 --> 00:06:46.587
Ah, here, here.

90
00:06:47.612 --> 00:06:49.555
Pretend... pretend
that that's a seed.

91
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.637
- It's a rock.
- I know it's a rock.

92
00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:55.321
<i>But let's just pretend for a minute it's
a seed. We'll just use our imaginations.</i>

93
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.245
Now, do you see our tree?

94
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.344
<i>Everything that made
that giant tree...</i>

95
00:07:00.414 --> 00:07:03.610
is already contained
inside this tiny little seed.

96
00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:06.614
All it needs is some time, a little bit
of sunshine and rain, and...

97
00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:08.596
voila!

98
00:07:09.823 --> 00:07:11.962
This rock will be a tree?

99
00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:14.420
Seed to tree. You've gotta
work with me, all right?

100
00:07:14.495 --> 00:07:16.568
You might not feel
like you can do much now,

101
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.128
but that's just because,
well, you're not a tree yet.

102
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.103
You just have to give yourself
some time. You're still a seed.

103
00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:24.380
But it's a rock.

104
00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.305
<i>I know it's a rock!</i>

105
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.144
Don't ya think I know a rock when I see a
rock? I've spent a lot of time around rocks!

106
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.383
You're weird, but I like you.

107
00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:35.966
They're here.

108
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.916
- They're coming!
- Run!

109
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.601
- Dot! Dot!
- Mom!

110
00:07:57.669 --> 00:07:59.742
- Mom!
- Thank heavens!

111
00:07:59.814 --> 00:08:04.255
- Food to the offering stone.
- Everyone, single file.

112
00:08:04.326 --> 00:08:07.709
Food to the offering stone
and into the anthill. Now let's go!

113
00:08:07.783 --> 00:08:10.947
Go, go, go, go!

114
00:08:34.634 --> 00:08:37.896
Come on, keep movin', keep movin'!
Good.

115
00:08:37.963 --> 00:08:40.329
<i>Okay. That's everyone.</i>

116
00:08:41.643 --> 00:08:43.498
<i>Hey!</i>

117
00:08:43.563 --> 00:08:46.118
Hey, wait for me!

118
00:08:46.189 --> 00:08:49.188
Get the food to the offering stone,
then into the anthill.

119
00:09:22.224 --> 00:09:24.080
Princess Atta!
Princess Atta!

120
00:09:24.145 --> 00:09:26.000
Princess Atta!

121
00:09:34.834 --> 00:09:38.728
They come, they eat, they leave.
They come, they eat, they leave.

122
00:09:38.802 --> 00:09:41.170
Excuse me, pardon me.
Pardon me, excuse me. Coming through.

123
00:09:41.235 --> 00:09:43.690
Sorry. Coming through. Princess Atta,
there's something I need to tell you.

124
00:09:43.763 --> 00:09:47.626
- Not now, Flik. Shh!
- But Your Highness, it's about the offering!

125
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.049
<i>Hey, what's goin'on?</i>

126
00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:52.979
<i>Yeah, where's the food?</i>

127
00:09:55.124 --> 00:09:59.152
<i>- What did you do?
- It was an accident?</i>

128
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.400
Boo!

129
00:10:17.592 --> 00:10:20.559
Where's the food?

130
00:10:31.225 --> 00:10:33.364
Hopper.

131
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.279
So, where is it?

132
00:11:00.349 --> 00:11:02.650
<i>Where's my food?</i>

133
00:11:05.533 --> 00:11:08.250
- I-I-Isn't it up there?
- What?

134
00:11:08.317 --> 00:11:10.838
- The food was in a leaf sitting on top...
- Excuse me.

135
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.951
Are you sure
it's not up there?

136
00:11:13.023 --> 00:11:15.063
- Are you saying I'm stupid?
- No.

137
00:11:15.134 --> 00:11:18.005
Do I look stupid... to you?

138
00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:21.342
Let's just think about the logic,
shall we? Think about it for a second.

139
00:11:21.408 --> 00:11:24.408
If it was up there,
would I be coming down here,

140
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:27.329
to your level,
looking for it?

141
00:11:27.393 --> 00:11:29.727
- Uh, I...
- Why am I even talking to you?

142
00:11:29.792 --> 00:11:32.379
You're not the queen.
You don't smell like the queen.

143
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.264
<i>Sh-She's learning
to take over for me, Hopper.</i>

144
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:40.284
Oh, I see. Under new management.
So it's your fault.

145
00:11:40.354 --> 00:11:43.257
No, it wasn't me, it was...

146
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.804
<i>Uh-uh-uh. First rule of leadership:
Everything is your fault.</i>

147
00:11:47.876 --> 00:11:51.454
- But-But I...
- It's a bug-eat-bug world out there, Princess,

148
00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:54.688
one of those circle-of-life
kind of things.

149
00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:57.985
<i>Now, let me tell you
how things are supposed to work.</i>

150
00:11:58.053 --> 00:12:01.947
The sun grows the food,
the ants pick the food,

151
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:03.931
the grasshoppers eat the food...

152
00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:06.012
<i>And the birds eat the grasshoppers.</i>

153
00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:09.250
Hey, like the one that nearly ate you,
you 'member? Oh, you shoulda seen it.

154
00:12:09.318 --> 00:12:12.579
This blue jay has him halfway down his
throat, and Hopper's kickin' and screamin'.

155
00:12:12.645 --> 00:12:14.501
<i>And I'm scared.
I'm not goin'anywhere near, okay?</i>

156
00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:19.138
Aw, come on.
It's a great story. Ow, ow, ow.

157
00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:22.917
I swear, if I hadn't promised
Mother on her deathbed...

158
00:12:22.983 --> 00:12:25.505
<i>that I wouldn't kill you,
I would kill you.</i>

159
00:12:25.576 --> 00:12:28.446
- And believe me, no one appreciates that more than I do.
- Shut up!

160
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.692
I don't want to hear another word
out of you while we're on this island.

161
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:33.183
Do you understand me?

162
00:12:33.257 --> 00:12:37.032
- I said, do you understand me?
- How can I answer? You said I couldn't say another word.

163
00:12:37.097 --> 00:12:39.552
Remember Ma!

164
00:12:43.882 --> 00:12:47.429
Hey, I'm a compassionate insect.

165
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.052
There's still a few months
till the rains come,

166
00:12:50.123 --> 00:12:53.353
so you can all just try again.

167
00:12:53.419 --> 00:12:56.037
<i>But, Hopper, since it's
almost the rainy season,</i>

168
00:12:56.107 --> 00:12:58.279
we need this time
to gather food for ourselves.

169
00:12:58.348 --> 00:13:00.715
Listen, if you don't
keep your end of the bargain,

170
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.920
then I can't guarantee your safety.

171
00:13:02.989 --> 00:13:06.666
And there are insects out there
that will take advantage of you.

172
00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:09.832
Someone could get hurt.

173
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.438
What's the matter?
You scared of grasshoppers?

174
00:13:25.904 --> 00:13:28.107
- Dot!
- You don't like Thumper?

175
00:13:29.232 --> 00:13:31.720
Leave her alone!

176
00:13:41.202 --> 00:13:44.913
You want her?
Go ahead... take her.

177
00:13:47.539 --> 00:13:50.923
No?
Then get back in line.

178
00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:59.954
It seems to me that you ants
are forgetting your place.

179
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.982
So let's double
the order of food.

180
00:14:04.053 --> 00:14:05.909
No! But-But...

181
00:14:05.974 --> 00:14:09.235
We'll be back
at the end of the season,

182
00:14:09.301 --> 00:14:12.717
when the last leaf falls.

183
00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:21.675
You ants have a nice summer.
Let's ride!

184
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.428
Yee-ha!

185
00:14:29.656 --> 00:14:31.794
Ooh!

186
00:14:43.514 --> 00:14:46.361
Flik, what do you have
to say for yourself?

187
00:14:46.425 --> 00:14:49.688
Sorry. I... I'm sorry
for the way I am.

188
00:14:49.754 --> 00:14:51.860
I didn't mean for things
to go so wrong.

189
00:14:51.931 --> 00:14:54.321
I especially didn't want
to make you look bad, Princess.

190
00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:57.527
- Well, Flik, ya did.
- I was just trying to help.

191
00:14:57.596 --> 00:15:01.688
<i>- Then help us... don't help us.
- Help, help. Help?</i>

192
00:15:01.757 --> 00:15:03.862
Flik, you are sentenced to
one month digging in the tunnels.

193
00:15:03.932 --> 00:15:07.578
Excuse me, Your Highness. Need I remind you
of Flik's tunnel-within-a-tunnel project?

194
00:15:07.645 --> 00:15:10.012
Helpers to help us.
That's it! We could...

195
00:15:10.078 --> 00:15:12.249
It took two days to dig him out.
Send him to Health and Ant Services.

196
00:15:12.318 --> 00:15:14.172
Heavens, no!

197
00:15:14.238 --> 00:15:18.297
We could leave the island, the river bed's
dry. We could walk across and get helpers.

198
00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:21.050
We could! We could go
find helpers to help us.

199
00:15:21.119 --> 00:15:24.894
- It's perfect!
- Perfect? What's so perfect?

200
00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:28.222
Your Highness, don't you see?
We could send someone to get help!

201
00:15:28.288 --> 00:15:30.197
Leave the island?

202
00:15:30.272 --> 00:15:33.917
Why didn't I think of that?
Oh! Because it's suicide!

203
00:15:33.984 --> 00:15:36.318
<i>- She's right! We never leave the island.
- Never leave!</i>

204
00:15:36.384 --> 00:15:38.654
There's snakes and birds
and bigger bugs out there!

205
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.859
Exactly! Bigger bugs!

206
00:15:40.929 --> 00:15:43.351
We could find bigger bugs
to come here and fight...

207
00:15:43.425 --> 00:15:45.913
and forever rid us
of Hopper and his gang!

208
00:15:45.986 --> 00:15:48.954
- Ludicrous!
- Who would do a crazy thing like that?

209
00:15:49.026 --> 00:15:51.676
I'll volunteer.
I'd be happy to volunteer.

210
00:15:51.746 --> 00:15:55.260
You got a lot of spunk, kid,
but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants.

211
00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:59.455
At least we could try. I could travel
to the city! I could search there!

212
00:15:59.524 --> 00:16:01.858
<i>If you went, you'd be
on that silly search for weeks.</i>

213
00:16:01.923 --> 00:16:03.648
Royal huddle.

214
00:16:03.717 --> 00:16:06.717
- Great idea, Princess. It's perfect!
- Exactly.

215
00:16:06.789 --> 00:16:09.637
- Wait a minute. What did we just decide here?
- To let Flik leave.

216
00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:12.418
While we keep harvesting
to meet Hopper's demands.

217
00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:16.708
- You see, with Flik gone, he can't...
- He can't mess anything up!

218
00:16:16.774 --> 00:16:22.437
Flik, after much deliberation, we have
decided to grant you your request.

219
00:16:22.503 --> 00:16:25.122
- Really?
- Really? - Uh, really.

220
00:16:25.192 --> 00:16:27.526
Oh, thank you, Princess.
Thank you so much for this chance.

221
00:16:27.591 --> 00:16:30.494
- I won't let you down, I promise, I promise, I promise.
- That's fine. No, forget it.

222
00:16:30.568 --> 00:16:34.496
- I should help repair the damage before I go.
- No! No, no!

223
00:16:34.568 --> 00:16:36.608
<i>Just leave!</i>

224
00:17:03.627 --> 00:17:05.515
Hey.

225
00:17:15.597 --> 00:17:19.908
Don't worry!
The colony is in good hands!

226
00:17:19.982 --> 00:17:22.153
Bye, now.

227
00:17:29.296 --> 00:17:31.368
All right.

228
00:17:33.327 --> 00:17:36.011
Hey, fellas.
Beautiful mornin', huh?

229
00:17:38.864 --> 00:17:42.029
My dad gives you one hour
before you come back crying.

230
00:17:42.097 --> 00:17:43.952
Does he, now?

231
00:17:44.017 --> 00:17:45.905
- My dad doesn't think that.
- He doesn't, huh?

232
00:17:45.969 --> 00:17:48.904
- Naw, he's bettin' you're gonna die.
- Oh.

233
00:17:48.978 --> 00:17:51.597
He says if the heat doesn't get ya,
the birds will.

234
00:17:51.666 --> 00:17:53.520
I think he's gonna make it.

235
00:17:53.586 --> 00:17:57.067
- Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness.
- Yeah, Dot. What do you know?

236
00:17:57.139 --> 00:17:59.277
Hey, hey, hey.
Ease up. Come on.

237
00:17:59.346 --> 00:18:01.616
She's entitled
to her opinion too.

238
00:18:11.509 --> 00:18:13.451
<i>Ohh.</i>

239
00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:15.597
So go, already.

240
00:18:15.668 --> 00:18:17.873
- Hey!
- The city's that way.

241
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:22.284
- I know.
- You're supposed to look for bugs, not dandelions.

242
00:18:22.358 --> 00:18:24.725
You leave him alone.
He knows what he's doing.

243
00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.764
<i>That's right.</i>

244
00:18:26.837 --> 00:18:31.792
Here I go. For the colony,
and for oppressed ants everywhere!

245
00:18:33.848 --> 00:18:35.703
Whoa-oh.

246
00:18:36.951 --> 00:18:39.374
<i>- Wow!
- Hey!</i>

247
00:18:39.449 --> 00:18:42.515
- Hey-hey!
- Bye, Flik!

248
00:18:48.602 --> 00:18:50.489
Wow!

249
00:18:50.554 --> 00:18:54.166
Wow. Ohh!

250
00:18:56.058 --> 00:18:57.945
Whoa!

251
00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:00.400
Good luck, Flik!

252
00:19:00.475 --> 00:19:03.377
Bye! Whoa-oh!

253
00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:05.524
Flik!

254
00:19:05.595 --> 00:19:08.661
I'm... okay!

255
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:12.594
- Your dad's right. He's gonna die.
- You just watch.

256
00:19:12.668 --> 00:19:16.411
He's gonna get the bestest,
roughest bugs you've ever seen!

257
00:19:18.588 --> 00:19:22.648
Get back! Get back!
Get back, you horrible beast!

258
00:19:22.718 --> 00:19:25.107
I have no fear! Aye-eee!

259
00:19:25.181 --> 00:19:27.670
- Ooh!
- Oh, my goodness.

260
00:19:27.742 --> 00:19:30.742
Oh, no!

261
00:19:32.863 --> 00:19:35.350
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim. An owie?
- Owie! Owie, owie.

262
00:19:35.422 --> 00:19:37.911
Please show Rosie the owie.
All right, Dim. It's okay.

263
00:19:41.183 --> 00:19:44.349
I have been in outhouses
that didn't stink that bad.

264
00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:47.003
This is ridiculous.
What a disappointment!

265
00:19:47.074 --> 00:19:50.369
- Oh, no!
- You! Come here! I want my money back!

266
00:19:50.433 --> 00:19:53.151
Uh, no refunds
after the first two minutes.

267
00:19:53.218 --> 00:19:54.844
Popcorn! Stale popcorn!

268
00:19:54.914 --> 00:19:57.784
We're losin' the audience!
You clowns get out there now!

269
00:19:57.859 --> 00:20:01.241
- I hate performing on an empty stomach!
- Do your act, Heimlich.

270
00:20:01.315 --> 00:20:04.512
- Then you can eat. Not now, Slim.
- P.T., what's the point?

271
00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:07.710
What's the point of going out there?
They'll only laugh at me.

272
00:20:07.779 --> 00:20:11.708
- That's because you're a clown!
- No, it's because I'm a prop!

273
00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.287
You always cast me as the broom,
the pole, the stick, a splinter.

274
00:20:16.356 --> 00:20:18.560
You're a walkingstick.
It's funny!

275
00:20:18.628 --> 00:20:20.833
- Now go!
- You parasite.

276
00:20:30.183 --> 00:20:33.150
Tra-la-la-la-la.
Spring's in the air.

277
00:20:33.222 --> 00:20:36.638
And I'm a flower with
nothing interesting to say.

278
00:20:36.711 --> 00:20:38.565
A bee!

279
00:20:38.631 --> 00:20:41.893
I am a cute little bumblebee!
Here I come!

280
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.019
Slow down, you flowers!

281
00:20:46.089 --> 00:20:50.529
Candy corn! Here,
let me help you to finish it.

282
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.594
Hey, cutie! Wanna pollinate
with a real bug?

283
00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:00.105
<i>Ooh, come to papa!</i>

284
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:04.677
So, bein' a ladybug automatically makes
me a girl, is that it, flyboy? Huh?

285
00:21:04.747 --> 00:21:07.203
- She's a guy!
- Francis, leave them alone.

286
00:21:07.276 --> 00:21:10.342
- They are poo-poo heads!
- Not again.

287
00:21:10.411 --> 00:21:13.063
Judging by your breath, you must have
been buzzin' around a dung heap all day.

288
00:21:13.133 --> 00:21:16.362
Come on, Francis.
You're making the maggots cry.

289
00:21:22.253 --> 00:21:25.036
All right, we're dyin' out there.
Gypsy, quick! You and Manny...

290
00:21:25.102 --> 00:21:27.142
Shh! He's in a trance.

291
00:21:27.213 --> 00:21:29.669
Well, get him out of it!
You and your husband are up now.

292
00:21:29.742 --> 00:21:31.597
Manny, we're on.

293
00:21:31.662 --> 00:21:36.365
Oh? Yet again it is up to me
to rescue the performance.

294
00:21:36.431 --> 00:21:38.286
Gypsy, come.

295
00:21:40.272 --> 00:21:43.021
- The stage is the other way, dear.
- Yes, of course.

296
00:21:43.087 --> 00:21:44.943
Anytime, pal!

297
00:21:45.008 --> 00:21:47.212
- I'm gonna pick the hairs out of your head one by one!
- Take your best shot!

298
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.135
- You name the place!
- Oh, yeah?

299
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.234
- Yeah, 'cause when you get there, you are dead!
- Francis, let me handle this.

300
00:21:52.304 --> 00:21:54.726
- That's no way to speak to a lady.
- I heard that, you twig.

301
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.347
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me
to present Manto the Magnificent...

302
00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:01.766
and his lovely assistant, Gypsy!

303
00:22:03.314 --> 00:22:08.750
From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia,

304
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.169
I give you the Chinese Cabinet...

305
00:22:12.244 --> 00:22:14.862
of Metamorphosis!

306
00:22:16.116 --> 00:22:18.386
Rosie, whole troupe.
Onstage! Finale! Now!

307
00:22:18.453 --> 00:22:21.005
<i>- Okay, I just need time to... Coming, coming.
- Now!</i>

308
00:22:21.076 --> 00:22:23.216
Tuck, Roll, let's get moving, guys.
We're up next.

309
00:22:25.621 --> 00:22:27.858
Don't you understand?
We are up!

310
00:22:27.926 --> 00:22:30.348
"Up-a."

311
00:22:30.422 --> 00:22:32.495
- Hey!
- Hey! They don't understand me.

312
00:22:32.567 --> 00:22:34.672
I summon the voice
of Confucius...

313
00:22:34.743 --> 00:22:37.198
<i>Get off the stage,
you old hack!</i>

314
00:22:37.271 --> 00:22:40.271
I demand to know who said that!

315
00:22:40.343 --> 00:22:43.573
How dare you!

316
00:22:45.719 --> 00:22:47.574
Ingrates!

317
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.317
<i>Manny? Manny!</i>

318
00:22:51.384 --> 00:22:55.378
I only got 24 hours to live
and I ain't gonna waste it here.

319
00:22:55.449 --> 00:22:57.304
Come on.

320
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.879
I've just about
had it with these losers!

321
00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:03.985
Flaming death!

322
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.112
I hold in my hand the match...

323
00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:12.343
the match that decides whether two bugs
live or die this very evening.

324
00:23:12.411 --> 00:23:16.121
<i>In a moment, I will light

336
00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:56.155
Not good enough, you say?
Well, what if they were all...

337
00:23:56.224 --> 00:23:58.080

<i>- for this act is so dangerous...</i>

341
00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.473
That if the slightest thing
should go wrong...

342
00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.638
- No!
- Go? Okay, through the tunnel...

343
00:24:16.707 --> 00:24:23.041
Whoa!

344
00:24:25.157 --> 00:24:27.546
- P.T!
- Oh, no!

345
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.883
Oh!

346
00:24:33.348 --> 00:24:35.554
- Water! We need some water!
- Water, water, water!

347
00:24:39.622 --> 00:24:42.852
Get me outta here!

348
00:24:42.919 --> 00:24:44.828
Oof!

349
00:24:46.824 --> 00:24:49.409
Wow!

350
00:24:52.008 --> 00:24:55.685
- It's the web. I'm sorry.
- You're all fired.

351
00:24:55.752 --> 00:24:58.470
- We got the water!
- Here we come, P.T!

352
00:25:00.905 --> 00:25:04.964
Whoo! Whoa!
Burn 'im again!

353
00:25:22.699 --> 00:25:24.937
No, Harry, no!
Don't look at the light!

354

I can't help it!
It's so beautiful!

00:25:33.229 --> 00:25:35.434
Try not to look
like a country bug.

356
00:25:35.502 --> 00:25:38.152
Blend... blend in.

357
00:25:39.182 --> 00:25:41.037
<i>Hey, buggy!</i>

358
00:25:41.102 --> 00:25:43.339
<i>What do you expect?
The guy's a tick.</i>

359
00:25:50.928 --> 00:25:54.092
<i>Wow! The city!</i>

360
00:26:08.754 --> 00:26:12.585
<i>Making all stops to the septic tank,

empty bean can and dead rat.

00:26:16.243 --> 00:26:18.479
<i>Watch your stingers. All aboard!</i>

363
00:26:18.548 --> 00:26:20.457
- Hey! Oh, sorry.
- Get out of the way!

364
00:26:20.531 --> 00:26:23.019
- Watch where you're goin'!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

365
00:26:23.092 --> 00:26:25.580
Oh, sorry!

366
00:26:25.652 --> 00:26:28.173
<i>Oh. I'm really, really sorry.</i>

367
00:26:28.245 --> 00:26:30.634
That was
an-an-an ac-ac-accident.

368
00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:36.143
- Hey, let go of me!
- I'll show ya who's tough!

369
00:26:36.213 --> 00:26:40.174
- And stay out!
- Tough bugs!

370
00:26:41.973 --> 00:26:44.789
- I knew an old lady who swallowed a fly...
- Wow!

371
00:26:44.854 --> 00:26:46.709
- Move it!
- Whoa!

372
00:26:46.774 --> 00:26:50.669
<i>Hey, waiter! I'm in my soup!</i>

373
00:26:50.743 --> 00:26:53.077
<i>I've been workin'out.
Feel my wing.</i>

374
00:26:53.143 --> 00:26:55.565
Yo!
Two Black Flags over here!

375
00:26:57.015 --> 00:27:00.365
- All right.
- Hair of the dog you bit.

376
00:27:00.441 --> 00:27:02.863
Hey, who ordered
the pu-pu platter?

377
00:27:03.897 --> 00:27:07.378
Here ya go, slick. Enjoy.

378
00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:10.385
Ow! Aah!
Hey, I said no salt!

379
00:27:11.611 --> 00:27:14.873
Pardon me, sir.
I represent a colony of ants,

380
00:27:14.939 --> 00:27:17.689
and I'm looking for tough bugs,
you know, mean bugs...

381
00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:20.625
Fired by a flea...
how humiliating!

382
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.555
Let's face it: We stink.

383
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.474
<i>- You fired!
- You fired!</i>

384
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.021
- Oh, will you shut up?
- You fired!

385
00:27:28.092 --> 00:27:30.995
Someday I will be
a beautiful butterfly,

386
00:27:31.069 --> 00:27:33.306
and then everything
will be better.

387
00:27:33.373 --> 00:27:37.302
I can't believe the troupe is
breaking up. We've always been together.

388
00:27:37.374 --> 00:27:41.335
- Farewell, my friends.
- To the audience we'll never have.

389
00:27:45.086 --> 00:27:48.153
Francis! Your boyfriends
from the circus are here!

390
00:27:50.142 --> 00:27:52.085
There she is.

391
00:27:56.288 --> 00:27:59.584
- Hello there, girly bug.
- Shoo, fly. Don't bother me.

392
00:27:59.648 --> 00:28:02.616
Say, why don't you
tell our pal, Thud,

393
00:28:02.689 --> 00:28:04.893
- what you said to us at the circus.
- Yeah.

394
00:28:04.961 --> 00:28:08.409
Somethin' about buzzin'
around a dung heap?

395
00:28:08.481 --> 00:28:11.416
Excuse me. Hi. I represent
an ant colony, and we're...

396
00:28:11.489 --> 00:28:14.906
Hey, bartender!
Bloody Mary, O-positive.

397
00:28:14.979 --> 00:28:16.834
Aha!

398
00:28:18.178 --> 00:28:20.034
Sir?

399
00:28:20.099 --> 00:28:23.994
' Ladybug, ladybug
fly away home '

400
00:28:24.068 --> 00:28:26.305
Not so tough now, are you?

401
00:28:26.372 --> 00:28:28.412
All right, clown.
Get up and fight like a girl.

402
00:28:28.483 --> 00:28:31.833
- Get ready to do the Robin Hood act.
- I want to be LittleJohn!

403
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:35.455
- What part can I play?
- You see, I'm looking for tough, warrior bugs.

404
00:28:35.525 --> 00:28:39.681
<i>Stand back, ye flies! We are
the greatest warriors in all bugdom!</i>

405
00:28:39.749 --> 00:28:42.499
- Warrior bugs!
- My sword!

406
00:28:42.566 --> 00:28:44.421
Swish, swish. Clang, clang.

407
00:28:44.486 --> 00:28:46.342
- LittleJohn?
- What ho, Robin?

408
00:28:46.407 --> 00:28:48.862
Justice is my sword
and truth shall be my quiver!

409
00:28:48.935 --> 00:28:52.001
Wait, wait! No, no!
I want to watch this!

410
00:28:52.071 --> 00:28:55.235
<i>- Jawohl!
- Thrust, parry, lunge!</i>

411
00:28:55.303 --> 00:28:57.508
Me thinketh it's not working!

412
00:28:57.576 --> 00:28:59.878
Back to Sherwood Forest!

413
00:28:59.944 --> 00:29:02.814
- Schnell! Schnell!
- What's going on in there?

414
00:29:14.346 --> 00:29:16.866
Help! Help! Get me out!

415
00:29:28.172 --> 00:29:31.467
<i>You're perfect!</i>

416
00:29:31.532 --> 00:29:36.584
Oh, great ones! I have been scouting
for bugs with your exact talents!

417
00:29:36.652 --> 00:29:39.435
<i>- A talent scout.
- My colony's in trouble.</i>

418
00:29:39.502 --> 00:29:43.244
Grasshoppers are coming! We've
been forced to prepare all this food.

419
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.318
- Dinner theater!
- Food?

420
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:48.357
Please!
Will you help us?

421
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:51.692
Where are they?

422
00:29:51.758 --> 00:29:55.556
- We'll take the job!
- Really? - Yes, yes, yes!

423
00:29:55.632 --> 00:29:57.966
You can explain
the details on the way.

424
00:29:58.031 --> 00:30:00.421
Hey!

425
00:30:00.497 --> 00:30:03.845
- Okay, come on, everyone. Break a leg!
- Whoa, you're vicious!

426
00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.776
Hold on, Mr. Ant.

427
00:30:05.905 --> 00:30:10.761
Amazing!
This is too good to be true!

428
00:30:25.842 --> 00:30:27.698
Ooh!

429
00:30:32.148 --> 00:30:35.050
So, you see, it was my fault
that Hopper's coming back.

430
00:30:35.123 --> 00:30:38.223
But then, Princess Atta...
boy, is she one in a million...

431
00:30:38.293 --> 00:30:40.148
she let me go out and find you.

432
00:30:40.214 --> 00:30:42.603
And after seeing you
fight off those flies...

433
00:30:42.678 --> 00:30:45.645
Boy, are those grasshoppers
in for a surprise!

434
00:31:08.248 --> 00:31:11.097
- Dr. Flora!
- Oh, dear. Not another one.

435
00:31:11.161 --> 00:31:13.048
- This is insane.
- Insane.

436
00:31:13.113 --> 00:31:15.416
There's just not enough
food left on the island!

437
00:31:15.482 --> 00:31:17.970
No way we can make double quota
before Hopper comes.

438
00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:21.904
Well, we have to try, Thorny.
We don't have any choice.

439
00:31:21.978 --> 00:31:23.920
Yeah, I know.

440
00:31:25.595 --> 00:31:29.305
<i>Hey, look who's playing
lookout again... little Speck!</i>

441
00:31:29.371 --> 00:31:33.562
<i>- The name is Dot.
- Well, Spot, still lookin' for Flik?</i>

442
00:31:33.628 --> 00:31:36.695
Forget it, Dot.
That loser's never coming back.

443
00:31:38.044 --> 00:31:40.018
<i>Flik!
He did it! He did it!</i>

444
00:31:40.092 --> 00:31:42.810
What? Quit shoving!

445
00:31:46.941 --> 00:31:50.487
This is it!
This is Ant Island!

446
00:31:50.558 --> 00:31:54.269
Flik! Over here!
Flik! Flik!

447
00:31:54.335 --> 00:31:57.532
- Hey!
- He did it! He did it! Yea!

448
00:31:57.599 --> 00:32:00.916
- He did it!
- Cool!

449
00:32:00.991 --> 00:32:04.308
At the rate these leaves are dropping,
we're gonna need a miracle.

450
00:32:04.384 --> 00:32:06.489
That's right!
We need a miracle!

451
00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:12.892
Run for your lives!

452
00:32:20.738 --> 00:32:22.941
Ta-da!

453
00:32:28.355 --> 00:32:32.447
Once again,
our reputation precedes us.

454
00:32:32.515 --> 00:32:34.905
Hey, everybody!
Hey! I'm back!

455
00:32:34.979 --> 00:32:40.348
<i>Hey, guys! Hey-ey!
Look-look-look who's here with me!</i>

456
00:32:40.421 --> 00:32:45.211
Flik! Flik! Flik! You're back!
I knew you could do it!

457
00:32:45.286 --> 00:32:47.871
- Flik?
- It's Flik!

458
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:56.797
- Flik has returned!
- He's back?

459
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.975
And he's accompanied
by savage insects!

460
00:32:59.046 --> 00:33:04.513
<i>What? How? He wasn't supposed
to actually find someone!</i>

461
00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:06.919
Oh, look at this.
This is great. Look.

462
00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:09.319
<i>- Oh, my ticker!
- So, what are you supposed to be?</i>

463
00:33:09.385 --> 00:33:11.807
He's a stick, stupid.
You hit bugs with him.

464
00:33:11.881 --> 00:33:14.630
- Well, that's an oversimplification.
- That's right, kids. Like this!

465
00:33:14.697 --> 00:33:16.551
- No! Put me down!
- Ow!

466
00:33:16.616 --> 00:33:20.708
- Hey!
- My, you just pop right open there, dontcha?

467
00:33:20.777 --> 00:33:23.975
- Ooh! Wow!
- Uh-oh. Kids, He's kinda ticklish.

468
00:33:24.043 --> 00:33:26.530
Let's come on out. Careful.

469
00:33:28.939 --> 00:33:32.354
Well, my boy, you came through.

470
00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:35.330
Aphie and I are very impressed.

471
00:33:35.404 --> 00:33:40.838
Princess Atta! Hey, guys, Princess Atta!
She's the one that sent me to find you!

472
00:33:40.908 --> 00:33:44.324
- Did you see that really big bug over there?
- He looks absolutely ferocious!

473
00:33:44.397 --> 00:33:47.910
- They're our ticket out of this mess!
- They came just in time!

474
00:33:47.981 --> 00:33:51.080
So, Princess Atta,
what do you think?

475
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:53.996
No-no-no, wait!
This was not supposed to happen.

476
00:33:55.438 --> 00:33:57.380
Mayday, Mayday.
We're losin' the job.

477
00:33:57.454 --> 00:33:59.308
We don't fight grasshoppers.

478
00:33:59.373 --> 00:34:02.124
<i>- We don't, but they will.
- Bingo!</i>

479
00:34:02.191 --> 00:34:04.711
We gotta sweeten the deal.

480
00:34:05.936 --> 00:34:08.805
Your Majesty,
ladies and gentlemen,

481
00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:11.465
boys and girls of all ages,

482
00:34:11.536 --> 00:34:15.114
our troupe here guarantees
a performance like no other!

483
00:34:15.183 --> 00:34:18.031
Why, when your grasshopper friends
get here, we are gonna...

484
00:34:18.097 --> 00:34:20.814
knock them dead!

485
00:34:24.498 --> 00:34:27.117
Boy, these folks are sure
hard up for entertainment.

486
00:34:31.923 --> 00:34:33.778
<i>Come on, come on. Hurry!</i>

487
00:34:33.843 --> 00:34:36.526
Wow!

488
00:34:56.373 --> 00:34:58.741
Honey, relax.
You should be proud of yourself.

489
00:34:58.806 --> 00:35:02.516
Your instincts on that boy
were right on the money.

490
00:35:09.944 --> 00:35:13.457
And to make our official
welcome complete... Mr. Soil?

491
00:35:13.527 --> 00:35:16.398
<i>- Yes, Your Highness?
- He's our resident thespian.</i>

492
00:35:16.473 --> 00:35:20.085
<i>Last year he played the lead
in Picnic.</i>

493
00:35:20.153 --> 00:35:24.015
The children... and myself...
have quickly put together...

494
00:35:24.089 --> 00:35:27.951
a little presentation
in honor of our guests.

495
00:35:28.025 --> 00:35:30.743
Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub?

496
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:32.982
Oh, aren't they adorable!
Ooh, they're cute!

497
00:35:35.291 --> 00:35:39.601
The South Tunnel Elementary School
second grade class...

498
00:35:39.675 --> 00:35:44.116
would like to present you with this,
a mural we have drawn...

499
00:35:44.188 --> 00:35:47.931
of you bugs helping us
fight the grasshoppers away.

500
00:35:47.997 --> 00:35:52.188
Oh, look at the beautiful colors
of the blood.

501
00:35:52.254 --> 00:35:55.636
We drew one of you dying because our
teacher said it would be more dramatic.

502
00:36:00.894 --> 00:36:04.310
I tell you a tale of heroes so bold,

503
00:36:04.383 --> 00:36:08.181
who vanquished our
grasshopper enemies of old.

504
00:36:10.047 --> 00:36:12.468
Look, the last leaf has fallen.

505
00:36:12.543 --> 00:36:15.642
We are the grasshoppers!
Where's our food?

506
00:36:15.712 --> 00:36:18.712
Who will come
to save us poor ants?

507
00:36:18.785 --> 00:36:21.752
We are the warriors,
here to defend you!

508
00:36:22.721 --> 00:36:27.511
<i>I die! Die! Die!</i>

509
00:36:30.178 --> 00:36:35.197
Thank you, thank you! Oh, thank you!

510
00:36:35.266 --> 00:36:37.917
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I say we go.

511
00:36:37.987 --> 00:36:40.671
- Okay, honey. You're up.
- Oh. Um...

512
00:36:40.739 --> 00:36:44.634
<i>- Oh, oh, I-I...
- We're all very grateful to have...</i>

513
00:36:44.708 --> 00:36:47.043
- Here, here.
- the warriors...

514
00:36:48.068 --> 00:36:49.923
Thanks.

515
00:36:49.988 --> 00:36:54.080
I'd like to thank the warriors
for helping us in our fight...

516
00:36:54.149 --> 00:36:57.052
Against the grasshoppers.

517
00:36:57.126 --> 00:37:00.093
Secondly, I would like
to thank Flik...

518
00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:02.687
- for his forthright thinking...
- Thank you, Your Highness.

519
00:37:02.758 --> 00:37:06.817
Oh, sure, I'd like to take credit for
all of this, but that wouldn't be right.

520
00:37:06.887 --> 00:37:10.051
Because it was you, Princess Atta.
You believed in me...

521
00:37:10.119 --> 00:37:13.055
<i>- Tell that ant that we need to talk to him right now.
- Okay, okay.</i>

522
00:37:13.128 --> 00:37:16.389
I know I've made mistakes in the past,
and I hope that this will make up...

523
00:37:16.455 --> 00:37:18.595
- Flik!
- Not right now, Rosie. I'm making a speech.

524
00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:22.756
Now, I truly believe these bugs
are the answer to our...

525
00:37:22.825 --> 00:37:27.015
No, there's no circus around here.
So, I...

526
00:37:32.393 --> 00:37:35.875
Your Highness, the warriors have called for
a secret meeting to plan for a circus...

527
00:37:35.946 --> 00:37:39.078
<i>circumventing the oncoming hordes so
they can trapeze... trap them with ease!</i>

528
00:37:39.147 --> 00:37:41.481
- Shouldn't I come too?
- No!

529
00:37:41.547 --> 00:37:46.850
No, classified in the D.M.Z. Gotta go
A.S.A.P. You know, strictly B.Y.O.B. Bye!

530
00:37:46.923 --> 00:37:49.924
<i>Sorry. Sorry I have to take
the warriors away so early,</i>

531
00:37:49.996 --> 00:37:53.574
but you know they have a lot to get
done, with the battle looming and all.

532
00:37:53.643 --> 00:37:55.946
<i>So, uh, please,
everyone enjoy the party.</i>

533
00:37:56.012 --> 00:37:58.598
"B.Y.O.B."?

534
00:37:58.669 --> 00:38:01.037
Thanks again. Bye. Bye-bye.

535
00:38:01.102 --> 00:38:03.077
Okay, just...
just get in there. Go!

536
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.005
Go! Go, go, go!

537
00:38:06.222 --> 00:38:09.997
Circus bugs?
How can you be circus bugs?

538
00:38:10.062 --> 00:38:11.918
- What?
- Hey, hey, hey.

539
00:38:11.983 --> 00:38:14.568
<i>- You said nothin' about killin' grasshoppers. You lied to us!
- Ja!</i>

540
00:38:14.639 --> 00:38:16.680
Are you kidding?
Do you know what this is?

541
00:38:16.752 --> 00:38:19.086
This, my friends,
is false advertising.

542
00:38:19.152 --> 00:38:24.106
How dare you! You, sir,
are the charlatan in this scenario...

543
00:38:24.176 --> 00:38:26.349
touting your wares
as a talent scout,

544
00:38:26.418 --> 00:38:29.068
preying upon the hungry souls
of hapless artistes.

545
00:38:29.137 --> 00:38:30.992
Good day to you, sir.

546
00:38:35.602 --> 00:38:39.247
Wait! No, no!
Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't go.

547
00:38:39.315 --> 00:38:42.861
You have got to help me. Give me
some time, I'll come up with a plan.

548
00:38:42.931 --> 00:38:47.186
- Just go tell them the truth!
- They can't know the truth. The truth, you see, is bad.

549
00:38:47.251 --> 00:38:51.082
I will be branded for life. My children's
children will walk down the street,

550
00:38:51.155 --> 00:38:55.978
people will point and say, " Look! There
goes the spawn of Flik, the loser!"

551
00:38:56.052 --> 00:38:59.697
Oh... oh, you know, all right, fine.
Yeah, okay. Just go.

552
00:38:59.765 --> 00:39:02.253
But if you could just do me
a little favor before you leave.

553
00:39:02.325 --> 00:39:05.970
If you could squish me,
that would be great, because, uh,

554
00:39:06.038 --> 00:39:07.892
when they find out,
I'm as good as dead.

555
00:39:07.958 --> 00:39:10.774
<i>- Flik!</i>

556
00:39:10.839 --> 00:39:14.101
<i>I really do think I should be
part of this meeting. Flik!</i>

557
00:39:14.167 --> 00:39:16.950
Aah! Princess Atta!
What a nice... surprise.

558
00:39:17.016 --> 00:39:18.871
Just what exactly is going on?

559
00:39:18.936 --> 00:39:21.620
I would like to speak
with the so-called "warriors."

560
00:39:21.688 --> 00:39:23.663
You can't! They are in the middle
of a top secret meeting right now,

561
00:39:23.737 --> 00:39:25.625
and they really should not
be disturbed... now.

562
00:39:25.689 --> 00:39:27.696
Right, guys?

563
00:39:27.769 --> 00:39:31.894
Could you ex... pl...
Could you excuse me, please?

564
00:39:31.962 --> 00:39:35.223
<i>- Wait, wait, wait! Please, don't go!
- I'm not going anywhere.</i>

565
00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:38.225
What is going on? Flik?

566
00:39:38.298 --> 00:39:42.073
Flik!
Ooh, I knew it!

567
00:39:42.139 --> 00:39:46.132
<i>Wait! Wait,
wait, wait, wait! Please! Don't go!</i>

568
00:39:46.331 --> 00:39:50.193
- No!
- Quick, he's losin' it!

569
00:39:50.267 --> 00:39:53.879
- You can't go! I'm desperate!
- Really? I couldn't tell.

570
00:39:53.948 --> 00:39:57.080
Hmm. Come on, wings.

571
00:39:57.148 --> 00:39:59.483
Help!

572
00:39:59.549 --> 00:40:02.616
Mother,
Flik is up to something.

573
00:40:02.686 --> 00:40:05.238
Okay, Flik, time to put ya down.
Get him off me!

574
00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:07.382
He's cutting off the circulation.

575
00:40:07.453 --> 00:40:09.625
- No, no, no, no!
- Let go!

576
00:40:09.694 --> 00:40:14.070
<i>- Please, please, don't go!
- Put the stick down. Flik, I mean it, now.</i>

577
00:40:14.207 --> 00:40:17.054
<i>- Drop the stick.
- Run!</i>

578
00:40:18.208 --> 00:40:21.503
Boy, he runs fast
for a little guy.

579
00:40:21.567 --> 00:40:25.016
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!

580
00:40:29.889 --> 00:40:32.310
This way.

581
00:40:33.345 --> 00:40:36.477
There they are.

582
00:40:36.546 --> 00:40:39.743
- A bird!
- Flik!

583
00:40:39.811 --> 00:40:42.232
- Look!
- Dot!

584
00:40:42.307 --> 00:40:44.161
Flik!

585
00:40:47.012 --> 00:40:49.597
- Dot!
- My baby!

586
00:40:50.788 --> 00:40:53.788
I gotcha! I gotcha!

587
00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.762
I gotcha, I gotcha!

588
00:40:56.836 --> 00:40:59.291
Oww!

589
00:40:59.364 --> 00:41:01.307
Oooh.

590
00:41:01.381 --> 00:41:03.104
- I can't see!
- Somebody do something!

591
00:41:03.173 --> 00:41:07.233
<i>- Are they all right?
- Did anyone see? - What is happening?</i>

592
00:41:09.157 --> 00:41:11.875
- Dot?
- Good heavens, they're in trouble!

593
00:41:11.942 --> 00:41:15.073
- Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis...
- Oh, you guys, I've got an idea!

594
00:41:15.142 --> 00:41:16.932
Here! I've got it!

595
00:41:19.751 --> 00:41:22.207
Please, ma'am, wake up!
Wake up!

596
00:41:26.439 --> 00:41:30.149
<i>- Help! Help!
- Yoo-hoo!</i>

597
00:41:30.216 --> 00:41:35.268
Mr. Early Bird! How about
a nice, tasty worm on a stick?

598
00:41:35.336 --> 00:41:37.923
I'm going to snap.
I'm going to snap.

599
00:41:37.994 --> 00:41:41.061
<i>Nice andjuicy, succulent...</i>

600
00:41:41.131 --> 00:41:43.269
Let's go!

601
00:41:46.219 --> 00:41:48.324
- There they are!
- Flik! Help!

602
00:41:49.483 --> 00:41:52.330
Okay.

603
00:41:52.396 --> 00:41:54.786
- Flik!
- It's going to be okay, Dot.

604
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:59.563
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Bye-bye, birdie!

605
00:41:59.629 --> 00:42:01.571
Help! I'm stuck!

606
00:42:01.645 --> 00:42:04.362
<i>Pull me down!
Schnell, schnell, schnell!</i>

607
00:42:04.429 --> 00:42:08.391
<i>- The caterpillar's using himself as live bait!
- How brave!</i>

608
00:42:13.325 --> 00:42:16.360
Suck it in, man!

609
00:42:21.967 --> 00:42:23.755
Ow. My leg!

610
00:42:36.528 --> 00:42:39.824
The bird!
Look out for the bird!

611
00:42:41.905 --> 00:42:43.433
Flik!

612
00:42:44.626 --> 00:42:46.797
Up-a, up-a!

613
00:43:02.548 --> 00:43:05.964
What is that?

614
00:43:06.037 --> 00:43:11.089
That, my friends,
is the sound of applause!

615
00:43:23.831 --> 00:43:26.963
Applause... I'm in heaven!

616
00:43:28.791 --> 00:43:31.923
<i>Our Blueberry troop salutes you bugs
for rescuing our smallest member,</i>

617
00:43:31.992 --> 00:43:33.847
<i>Princess Dot.</i>

618
00:43:33.912 --> 00:43:37.361
And as a tribute to Miss Francis,
we've changed out bandannas!

619
00:43:37.433 --> 00:43:40.816
We voted you
our honorary den mother!

620
00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:45.112
What? Great.

621
00:43:45.177 --> 00:43:48.855
All right, girls. Let's move
your keisters outta here now.

622
00:43:48.922 --> 00:43:51.476
The patient needs her rest,
you know. Come on.

623
00:43:51.547 --> 00:43:54.394
Excuse, me, Flik.
Can I talk to you for a second?

624
00:43:54.458 --> 00:43:56.214
- Huh? Oh, sure.
- Oww!

625
00:43:56.282 --> 00:44:00.178
Again, thank you all,
very, very much.

626
00:44:00.252 --> 00:44:02.162
<i>- Oh, stop it.
- You're too kind. - Thank you.</i>

627
00:44:02.685 --> 00:44:04.594
You don't think I've offended
the warriors, do you?

628
00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.555
<i>You? No.</i>

629
00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.792
Oh, good. Because, you see,

630
00:44:08.861 --> 00:44:12.090
when you first brought them here,
I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.

631
00:44:12.157 --> 00:44:14.100
Ya did?

632
00:44:14.174 --> 00:44:16.029
<i>Don't tell 'em I said that.</i>

633
00:44:16.094 --> 00:44:19.291
<i>Boy, that's all I'd need,
another royal blunder like that.</i>

634
00:44:19.358 --> 00:44:22.707
- Princess, you're doin' a great job.
- Thanks, you're sweet.

635
00:44:22.783 --> 00:44:25.271
You're wrong, but sweet.

636
00:44:25.343 --> 00:44:27.863
<i>- I know what everyone really thinks.
- I don't follow you.</i>

637
00:44:27.935 --> 00:44:33.206
Everyone... the whole colony. Nobody
really believes I can do this job.

638
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.834
<i>It's like they're all watching me,</i>

639
00:44:35.905 --> 00:44:39.997
- just, just...
- Waiting for you to screw up.

640
00:44:43.297 --> 00:44:46.265
- Flik, I owe you an apology.
- For what?

641
00:44:46.338 --> 00:44:50.136
Well, I haven't been that nice
to you, and... I'm sorry.

642
00:44:50.211 --> 00:44:52.065
If there's any way I can
make it up to you...

643
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:53.985
Hey! I know!

644
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:57.051
How would you like to be the queen's
official aide to the warrior bugs?

645
00:44:57.123 --> 00:45:00.418
- Me?
- Oh, sure. You've got a great rapport with them,

646
00:45:00.483 --> 00:45:03.746
especially after that rescue...
it was very brave.

647
00:45:03.812 --> 00:45:07.042
- Really? Naw, naw...
- Well, not every bug would face a bird.

648
00:45:07.108 --> 00:45:10.621
- I mean, even Hopper's afraid of'em.
- Yeah, well, I guess maybe I...

649
00:45:10.692 --> 00:45:14.271
- Say that again?
- I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds.

650
00:45:17.511 --> 00:45:19.365
Thank you.

651
00:45:22.055 --> 00:45:24.477
- Hopper's afraid of birds!
- And I don't blame 'im!

652
00:45:24.551 --> 00:45:26.405
Oh, oh, oh,
this is perfect.

653
00:45:26.471 --> 00:45:29.188
We can get rid of Hopper,
and no one has to know that I messed up.

654
00:45:29.255 --> 00:45:31.263
You just keep pretending
you're warriors.

655
00:45:31.335 --> 00:45:34.685
Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not
about to fight grasshoppers, okay?

656
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.143
You'll be gone before the grasshoppers
ever arrive. Here's what we do.

657
00:45:38.217 --> 00:45:40.072
Not another word.

658
00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:43.683
I don't know what you're concocting
in that little ant brain of yours,

659
00:45:43.753 --> 00:45:45.608
but we'll have no part of it.

660
00:45:45.673 --> 00:45:48.575
<i>Excuse me? Could we get
the warriors'autographs?</i>

661
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.505
<i>Autographs? Ja!</i>

662
00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:53.865
- Wow! Great!
- So, you fellas catch the action today?

663
00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.905
Oh! The bird went...
And it just missed you!

664
00:45:55.978 --> 00:45:59.721
- Aren't you sweet?
- And the way you pretended to be stuck in that crack!

665
00:45:59.787 --> 00:46:02.537
Oh, that's just all part of the plan.

666
00:46:02.603 --> 00:46:04.644
And then you dive-bombed
into the bush!

667
00:46:04.716 --> 00:46:07.977
- There you go, my boy.
- Wow! Thanks!

668
00:46:08.044 --> 00:46:09.931
"M-M-Maa-jor..."

669
00:46:09.997 --> 00:46:12.036
That's Major Manny, young cadet.

670
00:46:12.108 --> 00:46:16.004
- I outrank everyone here. Remember that.
- Yes, sir!

671
00:46:16.078 --> 00:46:17.932
- Dismissed!
- Wow!

672
00:46:17.997 --> 00:46:20.649
- When I grow up, I'm gonna be a praying mantis!
- I'm gonna be a stick bug!

673
00:46:20.718 --> 00:46:22.857
<i>Oh, they're all so cool,
I can't pick!</i>

674
00:46:22.926 --> 00:46:27.945
Delightful lads.
You were saying, Flik?

675
00:46:28.014 --> 00:46:31.015
All right.
We are going to build a bird...

676
00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:34.569
a bird that we can operate
from the inside, which would then be...

677
00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:38.950
...hoisted above the anthill
and hidden high in the tree.

678
00:46:39.025 --> 00:46:41.872
Then, right when Hopper
and his gang are below,

679
00:46:41.936 --> 00:46:46.247
we'll launch the bird
and scare off the grasshoppers.

680
00:46:46.321 --> 00:46:48.526
Now it's going to take
everyone's involvement...

681
00:46:48.594 --> 00:46:50.830
...to make this plan
a reality.

682
00:46:50.898 --> 00:46:53.866
I know it's not our tradition
to do things differently,

683
00:46:53.938 --> 00:46:57.287
but if our ancestors were able
to build this anthill,

684
00:46:57.363 --> 00:47:01.641
we can certainly rally together
to build this bird!

685
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:26.671
- Perfect!
- Okay, hit your marks!

686
00:47:42.713 --> 00:47:45.134
Hi, Flik.

687
00:47:51.962 --> 00:47:54.034
- I love what you did with your antenna.
- Oh, thank you.

688
00:47:54.106 --> 00:47:56.955
Oh, look.
She's a natural mother.

689
00:47:57.019 --> 00:48:00.150
All right, that's it!
Out! Everybody out!

690
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.721
Now you're gonna cry, right?
See if I care. Go ahead, cry.

691
00:48:04.795 --> 00:48:06.999
Please, don't cry. Please.

692
00:48:12.797 --> 00:48:15.611
Ta-da!

693
00:48:18.557 --> 00:48:21.557
Okay, lower, lower...

694
00:48:21.629 --> 00:48:24.477
- You got it. And that's it!
- Whoa!

695
00:48:24.541 --> 00:48:28.436
Up, up, up, up!

696
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:30.900
Rabbit through the hole, chicken in the
barn, two by two by, there's the yarn.

697
00:48:30.974 --> 00:48:32.829
- Done!
- Ruben Kincaid!

698
00:48:33.854 --> 00:48:37.171
- Hey!
- Good job, guys! Nice work!

699
00:48:39.392 --> 00:48:44.892
<i>Up, down.
Up, down. Up, down.</i>

700
00:48:49.312 --> 00:48:52.444
Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep.

701
00:49:08.772 --> 00:49:10.746
<i>Flik, watch out!</i>

702
00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:13.952
Look! I'm a beautiful butterfly!

703
00:49:19.237 --> 00:49:23.166
<i>There ya go. Goodjob, fellas.
Keep up the good work.</i>

704
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:28.896
Huh?

705
00:49:43.784 --> 00:49:45.922
Okay!

706
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:27.241
You're fired!

707
00:50:35.534 --> 00:50:37.390
Yes!

708
00:50:45.552 --> 00:50:49.993
Look at me!
I'm barefootin'! Whoo-hoo!

709
00:50:50.065 --> 00:50:52.848
<i>Yo, bugito,
dos granitos, pronto!</i>

710
00:50:52.913 --> 00:50:55.531
You gotta try this, man!

711
00:50:59.922 --> 00:51:03.053
<i>' La cucaracha, la cucaracha
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da '</i>

712
00:51:17.619 --> 00:51:22.094
<i>... all the way back there and it starts to
rain, we might as well be suckin'bug spray.</i>

713
00:51:22.165 --> 00:51:24.554
Ooh, don't even say that!
You know somethin'?

714
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:27.019
You're makin' a lot of sense.
I mean, why take the risk?

715
00:51:27.094 --> 00:51:29.964
- You should tell Hopper.
- Good idea.

716
00:51:30.039 --> 00:51:32.592
<i>But, you know,
it's really not our place.</i>

717
00:51:32.663 --> 00:51:35.762
You're his brother.
That makes you, like...

718
00:51:35.831 --> 00:51:37.903
the vice president of the gang.

719
00:51:37.975 --> 00:51:39.797
Wow! It kinda does,
doesn't it?

720
00:51:39.927 --> 00:51:43.757
Okay, I'll tell 'im.
I should talk to you guys more often.

721
00:51:43.832 --> 00:51:47.542
- What if Hopper doesn't like it?
- Then the genius'll get smacked and not us.

722
00:51:47.608 --> 00:51:50.291
Vice President Molt.

723
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.360
Ooh, yeah, that's good.
Oh, that's good.

724
00:51:53.433 --> 00:51:57.263
- Ooh, a little lower. Ahh, lower.
- Hey ya, Hop.

725
00:51:57.337 --> 00:52:00.020
- Go away.
- That's fine. Then I won't tell ya my idea.

726
00:52:00.089 --> 00:52:01.945
- Good!
- Okay, okay. I'll tell ya anyway.

727
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:05.141
I've been thinkin'... which is somethin'
I do, bein' vice president and all.

728
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:09.040
<i>This is a thought, and it was mine:
Why go back to Ant Island at all?</i>

729
00:52:09.114 --> 00:52:10.969
<i>- You don't even like grain.
- What?</i>

730
00:52:11.034 --> 00:52:13.402
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

731
00:52:13.467 --> 00:52:15.987
It wasn't even my idea.
It was Axle and Loco's!

732
00:52:16.059 --> 00:52:18.580
They talked fancy to me.
I got confused!

733
00:52:18.652 --> 00:52:22.995
<i>' La cucaracha, la cucaracha '</i>

734
00:52:29.214 --> 00:52:32.562
Guys, order another round...

735
00:52:32.637 --> 00:52:35.094
because we're stayin' here!

736
00:52:35.167 --> 00:52:37.239
Yeah!

737
00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:41.534
What was I thinking?
Going back to Ant Island.

738
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.454
I mean, we just got here,

739
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.757
and we have more than enough food
to get us through the winter.

740
00:52:45.824 --> 00:52:47.679
<i>Right? Why go back?</i>

741
00:52:51.073 --> 00:52:54.847
But there was that ant
that stood up to me.

742
00:52:54.912 --> 00:52:58.525
- Yeah, but we can forget about him!
- Yeah, it was just one ant.

743
00:52:58.593 --> 00:53:00.830
- Ooo-oooh!
- One ant!

744
00:53:00.898 --> 00:53:05.600
Yeah, you're right!
It's just one ant!

745
00:53:05.665 --> 00:53:09.310
- Yeah, boss. They're puny!
- Hmm, puny.

746
00:53:09.378 --> 00:53:13.918
Say, let's pretend this grain
is a puny little ant.

747
00:53:13.987 --> 00:53:16.672
<i>- Didn't that hurt?
- Nope.</i>

748
00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:20.035
- Well, how 'bout this one?
- Are you kiddin'?

749
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:23.232
Well, how 'bout this?

750
00:53:34.694 --> 00:53:37.728
You let one ant stand up to us,

751
00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:40.667
<i>then they all might stand up.</i>

752
00:53:40.742 --> 00:53:45.565
Those puny little ants
outnumber us a hundred to one.

753
00:53:45.638 --> 00:53:50.342
And if they ever figure that out,
there goes our way of life!

754
00:53:50.408 --> 00:53:55.712
It's not about food.
It's about keeping those ants in line.

755
00:53:55.784 --> 00:53:58.599
That's why we're going back!

756
00:53:58.664 --> 00:54:00.770
Does anybody else wanna stay?

757
00:54:02.985 --> 00:54:05.888
He's quite the motivational
speaker, isn't he?

758
00:54:07.274 --> 00:54:09.608
Let's ride!

759
00:54:24.428 --> 00:54:26.633
<i>- To the bird!
- The bird!</i>

760
00:54:35.917 --> 00:54:37.772
Get down, roly boys!

761
00:54:37.838 --> 00:54:40.772
- How low can you go? Sing it now.
- ' How low can you go '

762
00:54:40.846 --> 00:54:42.952
Do it, Princess. ' How low can you go '

763
00:54:43.023 --> 00:54:45.324
And that's how my 12th husband died.

764
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:47.912
So, now I'm a widow. I mean,
I've always been a black widow,

765
00:54:47.983 --> 00:54:51.365
<i>but now I'm a black widow widow.</i>

766
00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.069
Whoo!

767
00:54:57.681 --> 00:55:01.937
<i>- Thorny! Any sign of those fiends?
- Lemme check.</i>

768
00:55:04.978 --> 00:55:07.628
No, not yet.
But we'll be ready for 'em.

769
00:55:07.697 --> 00:55:10.415
Blueberries, dismissed!

770
00:55:10.482 --> 00:55:13.329
And, uh, quit beatin' the boys up.

771
00:55:13.395 --> 00:55:16.657
Those little raisins
do grow on ya.

772
00:55:16.723 --> 00:55:18.730
Hey, how you guys doin'?
Some party, huh?

773
00:55:18.803 --> 00:55:21.651
Is that grain dip fresh or what?

774
00:55:21.716 --> 00:55:23.854
Okay, I've told everyone you'll be
stationed deep in the command bunker.

775
00:55:23.923 --> 00:55:27.240
Party quiets down, I sneak you out the back
way and then you're outta here forever.

776
00:55:29.013 --> 00:55:32.112
Dim don't wanna go.

777
00:55:32.181 --> 00:55:35.727
<i>Well, if Dim stays he's gonna
need me here. He's not fully trained.</i>

778
00:55:35.797 --> 00:55:37.652
I mean, house-trained.

779
00:55:37.717 --> 00:55:41.330
I, uh, I kinda promised the Blueberries
I'd teach 'em canasta.

780
00:55:41.398 --> 00:55:45.676
It seems we've been booked
for an extended engagement.

781
00:55:48.695 --> 00:55:52.689
<i>Will you look at this colony?
Will you just look at this colony?</i>

782
00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.865
I don't even recognize it.

783
00:55:54.936 --> 00:55:57.140
I feel 70 again!

784
00:55:57.208 --> 00:56:01.234
Work that ab, baby!

785
00:56:01.304 --> 00:56:04.688
And I have you bugs to thank for it.
So... thank you!

786
00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.728
And, uh, thank you
for findin' 'em, Flik.

787
00:56:07.801 --> 00:56:09.940
Me? Oh, ooh...
uh, uh, I'll get it.

788
00:56:10.009 --> 00:56:11.864
I mean, if you don't mind,
I'll just...

789
00:56:11.929 --> 00:56:13.785
It's all tangled up.

790
00:56:13.851 --> 00:56:15.923
- There.
- Ow!

791
00:56:15.995 --> 00:56:18.134
I think I'll go check
on the bird.

792
00:56:20.539 --> 00:56:23.158
<i>Bird's this way.
Yeah, the bird's that way.</i>

793
00:56:23.228 --> 00:56:26.130
She... What?

794
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:37.043
Jiminy H. Cricket!

795
00:56:39.518 --> 00:56:42.616
<i>They're back!
Get ready, everybody!</i>

796
00:56:42.686 --> 00:56:45.054
<i>Get to your posts!</i>

797
00:56:45.118 --> 00:56:47.900
Battle stations, everyone.
This not a drill.

798
00:56:47.966 --> 00:56:52.539
Come on, everyone. You know your jobs!
Let's go, go, go, go!

799
00:56:52.607 --> 00:56:55.542
Look out!

800
00:56:56.992 --> 00:56:58.901
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa there.
Steady, girls. That's it.

801
00:56:58.975 --> 00:57:01.846
- Oh, it's P.T.
- P.T.?

802
00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:06.296
Greetings and salutations!
Ooh-boppa-doo and how do you do?

803
00:57:06.369 --> 00:57:10.559
I am the great P.T. Flea!

804
00:57:10.625 --> 00:57:13.692
I'm in need of your assis...
Oh, let's just cut to the chase.

805
00:57:13.762 --> 00:57:16.992
<i>Look, I've been goin'
from anthill to anthill.</i>

806
00:57:17.058 --> 00:57:20.222
I'm lookin' for a bunch of circus
performers. Have you seen 'em?

807
00:57:23.331 --> 00:57:26.015
Wait a second.
Ain't that Staff Sergeant Slim?

808
00:57:26.084 --> 00:57:28.124
No, no, no. I'm sorry, no, but uh...

809
00:57:28.196 --> 00:57:30.051
<i>Be quiet!</i>

810
00:57:30.116 --> 00:57:32.123
Hey!

811
00:57:32.196 --> 00:57:33.953
<i>You'll probably...
you'll probably want to get goin'!</i>

812
00:57:34.021 --> 00:57:37.152
I guess you got a lot of other anthills
to check into, so, bye!

813
00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:40.352
Ah, guys, I've been lookin'
all over for ya!

814
00:57:40.421 --> 00:57:43.805
- Flaming Death is a huge hit!
- P.T! Sh...

815
00:57:43.879 --> 00:57:46.050
<i>- I'm serious. Word of mouth got around.
- P. T..! No!</i>

816
00:57:46.118 --> 00:57:48.508
The next day, there was a line of flies
outside the tent went on forever!

817
00:57:48.583 --> 00:57:50.438
<i>- It must have been a foot long!
- P. T., no!</i>

818
00:57:50.503 --> 00:57:53.668
So, I figured it out. You guys burn me
twice a night, I take a day off to heal,

819
00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:55.591
and then we do it
all over again!

820
00:57:55.656 --> 00:57:58.754
We'll be the top circus act
in the business!

821
00:57:58.823 --> 00:58:00.679
You mean, you're not warriors?

822
00:58:00.744 --> 00:58:05.567
Are you kiddin'? These guys are the
lousiest circus bugs you've ever seen.

823
00:58:05.641 --> 00:58:07.975
And they're gonna make me rich!

824
00:58:08.041 --> 00:58:10.976
You mean to tell me that
our entire defensive strategy...

825
00:58:11.049 --> 00:58:13.351
was concocted by clowns?

826
00:58:13.417 --> 00:58:15.490
Hey, hey, hey, hey. We really thought
Flik's idea was gonna work.

827
00:58:18.986 --> 00:58:22.020
- Oops.
- Tell me this isn't true.

828
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:24.937
- No, you don't... You don't...
- This couldn't have happened at a more inopportune time!

829
00:58:25.002 --> 00:58:26.858
The last leaf is about to fall!

830
00:58:26.923 --> 00:58:29.127
<i>We haven't collected
any food for the grasshoppers!</i>

831
00:58:29.195 --> 00:58:31.335
<i>If Hopper finds out
what we almost did...</i>

832
00:58:31.404 --> 00:58:34.403
<i>Hopper is not going
to find out.</i>

833
00:58:34.475 --> 00:58:37.792
We're going to hide all this,
and pretend it never happened.

834
00:58:37.868 --> 00:58:41.612
You bugs were never here.
So I suggest you all leave.

835
00:58:41.678 --> 00:58:44.133
But the bird!
The-The bird will work.

836
00:58:44.206 --> 00:58:48.265
I never thought I'd see the day
when an ant would put himself...

837
00:58:48.334 --> 00:58:51.269
<i>- before the rest ofhis colony.
- What?</i>

838
00:58:51.343 --> 00:58:54.759
- The point is, Flik, you lied to us.
- No, no, no! I-I...

839
00:58:54.832 --> 00:58:57.482
You lied, Flik. You lied to her.

840
00:58:57.552 --> 00:59:01.000
<i>You lied to the colony!
You lied to me!</i>

841
00:59:01.072 --> 00:59:03.178
And like an idiot,
I believed you.

842
00:59:03.249 --> 00:59:06.761
But I-I was just afraid that...

843
00:59:06.832 --> 00:59:10.859
if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs...

844
00:59:10.929 --> 00:59:15.240
<i>- I just wanted to make a difference.
- I want you to leave, Flik.</i>

845
00:59:15.313 --> 00:59:18.608
And this time, don't come back.

846
00:59:28.819 --> 00:59:31.819
Tough crowd. Yee-haw!

847
00:59:31.891 --> 00:59:34.160
Flik!

848
00:59:58.935 --> 01:00:01.904
<i>Get those bugs!</i>

849
01:00:24.986 --> 01:00:27.768
That's it? But there's got
to be more food on the island!

850
01:00:27.834 --> 01:00:29.690
If we give up any more,
we'll starve.

851
01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:32.210
Hopper won't accept this!

852
01:00:37.404 --> 01:00:40.220
Mother, it's not enough.

853
01:00:40.285 --> 01:00:42.651
- What do we do?
- I-I don't know.

854
01:01:11.553 --> 01:01:14.455
You little termites!

855
01:01:14.529 --> 01:01:18.207
I give you a second chance,
and this is all I get?

856
01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:22.300
But Hopper, we ran out of time!

857
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:25.982
Have you been playing all summer?
You think this is a game?

858
01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:29.346
- No, no, please!
- Well, guess what?

859
01:01:29.411 --> 01:01:31.299
You just lost.

860
01:01:31.363 --> 01:01:34.811
Not one ant sleeps...

861
01:01:34.883 --> 01:01:38.113
until we get
every scrap of food...

862
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.449
on this island!

863
01:01:40.516 --> 01:01:43.364
Just do what he says. You don't
want to make him mad. Believe me!

864
01:01:45.061 --> 01:01:48.160
No, no, no.
You're staying with me, Your Highness.

865
01:01:48.229 --> 01:01:50.139
What do you think you're doing?

866
01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:53.887
- Get over there.
- Quick! To the clubhouse.

867
01:01:59.207 --> 01:02:01.411
Hurry!

868
01:02:09.896 --> 01:02:12.197
<i>Shut up a minute, will ya?</i>

869
01:02:12.264 --> 01:02:15.461
<i>- I think I heard something over here.
- Have you checked over there?</i>

870
01:02:15.529 --> 01:02:19.271
- No, not yet.
- Then get over there and check it out!

871
01:02:19.338 --> 01:02:21.346
Wait a minute.

872
01:02:21.418 --> 01:02:24.549
Hey, I think I found something.

873
01:02:26.539 --> 01:02:28.905
Cool. Hey, how do I look?

874
01:02:28.971 --> 01:02:30.826
Like an idiot.

875
01:02:30.891 --> 01:02:32.746
Oh, I don't know, maybe
it'll keep me dry in the rain.

876
01:02:32.811 --> 01:02:35.659
You moron, we'll be out of here
before it rains.

877
01:02:35.723 --> 01:02:38.538
Didn't you hear Hopper?
After the ants pick all the food,

878
01:02:38.604 --> 01:02:40.807
<i>he's gonna squish the queen
to remind 'em who's boss.</i>

879
01:02:40.875 --> 01:02:44.586
<i>Then she's dead. They cry... boo-hoo...
we go home. End of story.</i>

880
01:02:44.653 --> 01:02:47.752
Oh! Cool. I love our job.

881
01:02:47.821 --> 01:02:50.723
Stay here.
I'm gonna get help.

882
01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:36.365
Come on, wings, fly. Fly!

883
01:04:07.672 --> 01:04:09.526
' I'm gonna be
rich, rich, rich '

884
01:04:09.592 --> 01:04:13.520
' I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich I'm
gonna be the richest flea in the land '

885
01:04:13.592 --> 01:04:18.263
Ka-ching! ' The streets'll
be paved with golden retrievers '

886
01:04:18.329 --> 01:04:20.565
<i>' I'm rich, rich, rich
That's who I am ' '</i>

887
01:04:24.729 --> 01:04:27.827
- Poor fellow.
- Hey, maybe we can cheer him up a bit.

888
01:04:29.146 --> 01:04:33.139
Don't worry, Flik.
The circus life isn't so bad.

889
01:04:33.209 --> 01:04:35.698
- Yes, you can be part of our act.
- Here! Like this.

890
01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:40.179
Oof! Ahh.
Slapstick! Get it?

891
01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:44.475
<i>I- I'm a walkingstick.
Oh, never mind.</i>

892
01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:46.395
<i>- Flik!
- Dot?</i>

893
01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:49.275
Flik, wait! Wait!

894
01:04:49.341 --> 01:04:52.341
Dot, you're flying!
What are you doing here?

895
01:04:52.413 --> 01:04:54.551
You... have to go back.

896
01:04:54.621 --> 01:04:56.477
Hopper moved into the anthill,

897
01:04:56.542 --> 01:04:58.484
and his gang's eating everything!

898
01:04:58.558 --> 01:05:00.414
- Oh, no!
- Good heavens!

899
01:05:00.479 --> 01:05:02.715
And I heard a grasshopper say
that when they're finished,

900
01:05:02.782 --> 01:05:04.789
Hopper's gonna squish my mom!

901
01:05:04.862 --> 01:05:07.383
- Oh, not the queen!
- Do something! - How?

902
01:05:07.455 --> 01:05:10.521
<i>- Come on, you guys, think!
- I know. The bird.</i>

903
01:05:10.591 --> 01:05:12.567
- Yes, of course.
- The bird! That's brilliant.

904
01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.989
<i>- Ja!
- The bird won't work.</i>

905
01:05:16.064 --> 01:05:18.366
- What are you talking about? It was your idea.
- But you said that everything...

906
01:05:18.432 --> 01:05:20.952
Forget everything I ever told you.
All right, Dot?

907
01:05:21.024 --> 01:05:25.083
<i>Let's face it. The colony is right.
I just make things worse.</i>

908
01:05:25.152 --> 01:05:28.219
That bird is a guaranteed failure.

909
01:05:28.289 --> 01:05:30.362
Just like me.

910
01:05:30.433 --> 01:05:34.809
You listen to me, my boy. I've made
a living out of being a failure.

911
01:05:34.882 --> 01:05:36.922
<i>And you, sir, are not a failure!</i>

912
01:05:36.994 --> 01:05:39.929
- Oh, but Flik, you've done so many good things.
- Oh, yeah?

913
01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:41.858
Okay, show me one thing
I've done right.

914
01:05:41.923 --> 01:05:45.633
- Umm...
- Us.

915
01:05:45.699 --> 01:05:48.089
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Dim is right, my boy.</i>

916
01:05:48.164 --> 01:05:52.898
You have rekindled the long-dormant
embers of purpose in our lives.

917
01:05:52.964 --> 01:05:56.761
And if it wasn't for you, Francis would have
never gotten in touch with his feminine side.

918
01:05:56.836 --> 01:05:58.813
Oh yeah? Well... Hmm.

919
01:05:58.886 --> 01:06:00.741
You know what? He's right.

920
01:06:00.806 --> 01:06:03.294
Lieutenant Gypsy
reporting for duty.

921
01:06:03.366 --> 01:06:07.141
- Kid, say the word and we'll follow you into battle.
- We believe in you, my boy.

922
01:06:07.206 --> 01:06:09.116
Flik, please?

923
01:06:33.642 --> 01:06:35.813
Pretend it's a seed, okay?

924
01:06:40.618 --> 01:06:43.554
Thanks, Dot.

925
01:06:48.108 --> 01:06:50.955
- Hey, what's with the rock?
- Must be an ant thing.

926
01:06:51.019 --> 01:06:53.606
All right, let's do it.

927
01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:55.531
That's the Flik we know and love.

928
01:06:55.597 --> 01:06:57.507
- We're on!
- So, what do we do first?

929
01:06:59.085 --> 01:07:01.900
' Bugs will pay
big bucks to see '

930
01:07:01.965 --> 01:07:04.781
' A bonfire that is starring me ' '

931
01:07:04.846 --> 01:07:06.886
P.T., look. Money!

932
01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:08.714
<i>Where? Where?</i>

933
01:07:11.151 --> 01:07:16.171
All right. Get movin'! Get goin'.
Move your abdomens, now!

934
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.094
<i>They're rounding everyone up.</i>

935
01:07:19.312 --> 01:07:21.167
Hey! Turn your butt off.

936
01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.943
Psst! Hey, guys!
Get me out of this thing, will ya?

937
01:07:25.009 --> 01:07:26.864
I promise to start thinkin'
about payin' ya.

938
01:07:26.929 --> 01:07:29.516
<i>Hey! Wait, wait!
Okay, I'll pay ya! I'll pay ya!</i>

939
01:07:29.586 --> 01:07:32.717
<i>Oh, no!
They've finished collecting the food.</i>

940
01:07:32.786 --> 01:07:34.892
<i>We've got to get the queen now.</i>

941
01:07:34.963 --> 01:07:37.483
Once she's safe,
we move on Gypsy's signal.

942
01:07:42.419 --> 01:07:44.720
Someone's coming!

943
01:07:46.772 --> 01:07:50.033
Hello, kids! Ready to make
some grasshoppers cry?

944
01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:52.947
It's payback time,
Blueberry-style.

945
01:07:53.012 --> 01:07:54.866
Blueberries rock!

946
01:07:54.931 --> 01:07:56.623
All right!

947
01:07:58.772 --> 01:08:02.319
<i>Ladies and Gentlebugs!
Larvae of all stages!</i>

948
01:08:02.389 --> 01:08:06.580
<i>Rub your legs together for
the world's greatest bug circus!</i>

949
01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:20.021
Wait a minute.

950
01:08:20.087 --> 01:08:23.220
- I think I'm going to wet myself.
- Steady...

951
01:08:23.289 --> 01:08:26.103
- What's going on here?
- Well, uh...

952
01:08:26.168 --> 01:08:28.024
<i>Uh, yes.</i>

953
01:08:28.089 --> 01:08:30.609
We were invited
by Princess Atta...

954
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:33.911
<i>as a surprise for your arrival.</i>

955
01:08:33.978 --> 01:08:35.920
Squish 'em.

956
01:08:37.114 --> 01:08:39.220
Ooh...

957
01:08:40.507 --> 01:08:44.250
Hey!

958
01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:55.036
<i>Now that's funny.</i>

959
01:08:55.101 --> 01:08:56.889
<i>That is funny.</i>

960
01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:01.207
I guess we could use
a little entertainment.

961
01:09:01.278 --> 01:09:04.212
Looks like you did something right
for once, Princess.

962
01:09:04.285 --> 01:09:08.082
- On with the show!
- Hi-ya!

963
01:09:08.157 --> 01:09:10.164
Hey!

964
01:09:10.237 --> 01:09:13.205
' The circus, the circus
I love the circus '

965
01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.739
Ba-ba all gone!

966
01:09:27.809 --> 01:09:30.012
Baby wants pie!

967
01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.791
Pie? He asked for it.
Should I give it to him?

968
01:09:33.857 --> 01:09:36.792
Yeah! Give 'em pie!
Give 'em pie!

969
01:09:36.865 --> 01:09:39.070
Yeah! Hah!

970
01:09:39.138 --> 01:09:41.178
Thank you, gentlemen.
Always an intellectual treat.

971
01:09:41.251 --> 01:09:43.772
Say, how many roaches does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

972
01:09:43.843 --> 01:09:46.177
Can't tell. As soon as
the light goes on, they scatter!

973
01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.239
Ah, almost there.

974
01:10:02.309 --> 01:10:05.790
From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia,

975
01:10:05.861 --> 01:10:08.414
<i>- I give you the Chinese Cabinet...
- Come on, girls. Quick. Quick.</i>

976
01:10:08.486 --> 01:10:11.486
<i>Of Metamorphosis!</i>

977
01:10:11.558 --> 01:10:14.013
Utilizing psychic vibrations,

978
01:10:14.086 --> 01:10:17.567
- Ooh, ohh, pick me!
- I shall select the perfect volunteer.

979
01:10:17.638 --> 01:10:20.257
Ooh, no! Come on,
I'm askin' ya with my brain.

980
01:10:20.327 --> 01:10:24.102
- Aha! Why, Your Majesty!
- Me?

981
01:10:24.167 --> 01:10:26.753
No, no. Thumper, down. Let her go.

982
01:10:26.824 --> 01:10:28.679
Maybe he'll saw her in half.

983
01:10:28.744 --> 01:10:32.290
As you ascend the dung beetle
to the unknown,

984
01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.322
put your trust in the mysteries that
are beyond mere mortal comprehension.

985
01:10:36.393 --> 01:10:39.044
Ooh, this is gonna be good!

986
01:10:40.777 --> 01:10:42.666
- Blueberries ready?
- Ready.

987
01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:45.185
- Ready!
- Shh!

988
01:10:45.258 --> 01:10:48.193
I call upon the ancient
Szechwan spirits...

989
01:10:48.266 --> 01:10:51.201
<i>to inhabit the body
of our volunteer!</i>

990
01:10:51.275 --> 01:10:53.643
No, no.
Just stay in there, Your Majesty.

991
01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:55.847
Transformation.

992
01:10:55.916 --> 01:10:58.306
Transformation!

993
01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.388
<i>Transformation!</i>

994
01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:02.566
Wow.
Manny's gettin' good.

995
01:11:02.637 --> 01:11:05.953
- Not now.
- If it rains, that bird'll get ripped to shreds!

996
01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:13.962
<i>And now, insectus...</i>

997
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:17.226
<i>transformitus!</i>

998
01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:25.189
Ooh, pretty!

999
01:11:25.263 --> 01:11:28.711
Thank you, thank you.

1000
01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:31.567
<i>- Thank you.
- That's the signal. That's the signal!</i>

1001
01:11:34.545 --> 01:11:37.229
This is it, girls.
Get ready to roll.

1002
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.154
- Huh? It's stuck!
- That was amazing!

1003
01:11:42.226 --> 01:11:46.023
I have no... How did they do that?
I have no idea where she went.

1004
01:11:46.098 --> 01:11:48.487
<i>- Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
- More, more, more!</i>

1005
01:11:48.562 --> 01:11:51.280
Wait!

1006
01:11:51.347 --> 01:11:54.096
- Where is she?
- Well, now, uh, actually...

1007
01:11:54.162 --> 01:11:57.873
I am sorry. A magician
never reveals his secrets.

1008
01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:00.754
That's very true, Hoppy. Where would the
mystery be if we all knew how it was...

1009
01:12:00.819 --> 01:12:03.188
Shutting up.

1010
01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:06.417
- You can do it! You've got to make it work!
- Hey!

1011
01:12:07.701 --> 01:12:09.708
I said, where is she?

1012
01:12:09.781 --> 01:12:11.921
Ohh!

1013
01:12:19.063 --> 01:12:20.972
Hold on!

1014
01:12:30.008 --> 01:12:32.244
Bird! It's a bird!

1015
01:12:48.570 --> 01:12:52.662
Let's get out of here! Go!

1016
01:12:56.891 --> 01:13:00.754
Don't let it get me!
Don't let it get me!

1017
01:13:00.828 --> 01:13:02.682
Help me! Aaah!

1018
01:13:04.763 --> 01:13:06.619
<i>Up, down, up, down.</i>

1019
01:13:06.684 --> 01:13:09.466
And turn!

1020
01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:22.645
Oh, my eye! Help me!

1021
01:13:27.328 --> 01:13:29.400
Mmm, boysenberry.

1022
01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:33.334
Huh?
Aah, no, no, no, no, no!

1023
01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:41.693
Oh, the pain!

1024
01:13:41.761 --> 01:13:44.096
There goes my magic act!

1025
01:13:45.122 --> 01:13:48.025
- Flaming gas!
- No! P.T!

1026
01:13:53.283 --> 01:13:55.487
A direct hit! Ah-hee-ha!

1027
01:13:55.555 --> 01:13:57.409
Run!

1028
01:13:57.475 --> 01:13:59.963
Flik! Help us!

1029
01:14:19.173 --> 01:14:20.516
Dot!

1030
01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.995
Okay! Everyone out! Hurry!

1031
01:14:27.559 --> 01:14:29.414
Where's Dot?
Anyone seen Dot?

1032
01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.236
Whose idea was this?

1033
01:14:35.303 --> 01:14:37.159
Huh?

1034
01:14:38.536 --> 01:14:40.707
Was it yours, Princess?

1035
01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:43.330
Just get behind me, girls.
It'll be okay.

1036
01:14:43.401 --> 01:14:45.256
<i>Leave her alone, Hopper.</i>

1037
01:14:45.321 --> 01:14:49.184
The bird was my idea.
I'm the one you want.

1038
01:15:01.867 --> 01:15:03.777
Ohh.

1039
01:15:07.563 --> 01:15:09.866
Where do you get the gall
to do this to me?

1040
01:15:09.932 --> 01:15:13.577
You were...
You were gonna squish the queen.

1041
01:15:13.645 --> 01:15:16.133
It's true.

1042
01:15:16.205 --> 01:15:18.824
I hate it when someone
gives away the ending.

1043
01:15:20.814 --> 01:15:24.076
You piece of dirt!
No, I'm wrong.

1044
01:15:24.142 --> 01:15:27.012
You're lower than dirt.
You're an ant!

1045
01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:31.493
<i>Let this be a lesson
to all you ants.</i>

1046
01:15:31.567 --> 01:15:34.601
Ideas are very dangerous things.

1047
01:15:34.672 --> 01:15:37.988
<i>You are mindless,
soil-shoving losers,</i>

1048
01:15:38.063 --> 01:15:41.894
put on this earth to serve us!

1049
01:15:41.969 --> 01:15:44.718
<i>You're wrong, Hopper.</i>

1050
01:15:50.608 --> 01:15:55.529
Ants are not meant
to serve grasshoppers!

1051
01:15:59.153 --> 01:16:02.285
I've seen these ants
do great things.

1052
01:16:02.354 --> 01:16:04.721
And year after year,
they somehow manage...

1053
01:16:04.786 --> 01:16:08.202
<i>to pick food
for themselves and you.</i>

1054
01:16:10.834 --> 01:16:13.169
<i>So-So who is the weaker species?</i>

1055
01:16:14.579 --> 01:16:16.586
Ants don't serve grasshoppers.

1056
01:16:16.659 --> 01:16:19.343
<i>It's you who need us.</i>

1057
01:16:24.692 --> 01:16:27.726
We're a lot stronger
than you say we are.

1058
01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:30.895
And you know it, don't you?

1059
01:16:39.798 --> 01:16:42.613
Well, Princess!

1060
01:16:42.678 --> 01:16:45.329
Umm, Hopper?
I hate to interrupt, but, um...

1061
01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:53.557
You ants stay back!

1062
01:16:59.097 --> 01:17:02.131
<i>- Oh, this was such a bad idea!
- You see, Hopper,</i>

1063
01:17:02.202 --> 01:17:04.820
nature has a certain order.

1064
01:17:04.890 --> 01:17:08.784
<i>The ants pick the food,
the ants keep the food,</i>

1065
01:17:08.858 --> 01:17:10.998
and the grasshoppers leave!

1066
01:17:16.123 --> 01:17:19.385
- I'm so proud of you, Flik!
- Charge-a!

1067
01:17:19.451 --> 01:17:21.524
Where are you going?
They're just ants!

1068
01:17:21.596 --> 01:17:23.571
Oof!

1069
01:17:26.845 --> 01:17:29.561
No! Bad grasshopper!
Bad grasshopper! Go home!

1070
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.595
Yeah!

1071
01:17:36.668 --> 01:17:40.117
<i>Come back here,
you cowards! Don't leave!</i>

1072
01:17:40.190 --> 01:17:42.231
- To the cannon!
- To the cannon!

1073
01:17:42.302 --> 01:17:44.823
No!

1074
01:17:53.376 --> 01:17:55.001
Happy landings, Hopper!

1075
01:17:56.256 --> 01:17:58.110
Huh?

1076
01:18:05.793 --> 01:18:08.663
Rain!

1077
01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:36.448
- Flik!
- Quick! After them!

1078
01:18:36.517 --> 01:18:38.754
- Yaah!
- Aah! Aah!

1079
01:18:47.335 --> 01:18:49.920
Aah! Slim!

1080
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:52.358
<i>- Francis! Francis! Francis, I'm stuck!
- Where are ya?</i>

1081
01:18:52.423 --> 01:18:54.278
<i>- I'm over here! Here!
- Where?</i>

1082
01:18:54.343 --> 01:18:56.514
<i>I'm the only stick with eyeballs!</i>

1083
01:18:59.591 --> 01:19:02.178
- Help! Help!
- Get him!

1084
01:19:08.297 --> 01:19:11.592
Yes! Yes!

1085
01:19:14.601 --> 01:19:16.162
No!

1086
01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:32.331
- Go that way! I've got an idea!
- But the anthill's over...

1087
01:19:37.549 --> 01:19:39.403
- Flik!
- Come on!

1088
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:46.762
There!

1089
01:19:49.998 --> 01:19:51.854
Come on!
We've gotta hide!

1090
01:19:51.919 --> 01:19:54.734
No matter what happens,
stay down!

1091
01:19:54.799 --> 01:19:56.654
Flik, no!
What are you doing?

1092
01:19:58.608 --> 01:20:00.998
- Uh... Hopper!
- You think it's over?

1093
01:20:01.072 --> 01:20:02.927
No, no, no.
No, I-I can explain.

1094
01:20:02.992 --> 01:20:06.288
- All your little stunt did was buy them time!
- No, please!

1095
01:20:06.353 --> 01:20:07.727
Please, Hopper!

1096
01:20:07.793 --> 01:20:10.695
I'll get more grasshoppers
and be back next season,

1097
01:20:10.769 --> 01:20:12.908
but you won't!

1098
01:20:15.921 --> 01:20:18.442
Well, what's this?

1099
01:20:18.482 --> 01:20:20.783
Another one of
your little bird tricks?

1100
01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:24.146
- Yup.
- Are there a bunch of little girls in this one too?

1101
01:20:24.211 --> 01:20:26.577
Hello, girls!

1102
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:37.261
<i>No! No!
No, no, no, no!</i>

1103
01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:41.457
No! Aah!
No!

1104
01:20:41.525 --> 01:20:44.341
Oh, no!

1105
01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:48.596
<i>Oh, no! No, no, no!</i>

1106
01:20:57.719 --> 01:20:59.859
Come on, boys!

1107
01:20:59.928 --> 01:21:02.262
Hey, Princess Dot! Wait up!

1108
01:21:05.016 --> 01:21:07.187
I finally get a second to relax,

1109
01:21:07.256 --> 01:21:09.111
and I gotta get out of my chair.

1110
01:21:09.176 --> 01:21:13.170
- Come on! You can rub lotion on me later, shade boy.
- Yeah, hubba-hubba.

1111
01:21:15.193 --> 01:21:19.023
Oh, thank you!

1112
01:21:19.098 --> 01:21:21.270
- Oh, you're too kind!
- It was the least we could do. All in a day's work.

1113
01:21:21.338 --> 01:21:23.193
Dim!

1114
01:21:23.258 --> 01:21:25.363
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

1115
01:21:25.434 --> 01:21:27.736
I'm so sorry, kids.
I wish you could come along too.

1116
01:21:27.804 --> 01:21:30.170
I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna cry.

1117
01:21:38.205 --> 01:21:40.474
Hey, let's go. We got a schedule
to keep. Come on, let's go.

1118
01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:42.712
- Hup, hup, hey!
- Hey, Tiny! Let's get this show packed up!

1119
01:21:42.781 --> 01:21:44.635
We got paying customers hatching!

1120
01:21:44.701 --> 01:21:46.873
Yes, Mr. Flea. Yes, sir.
Of course, sir. Right away, sir.

1121
01:21:46.942 --> 01:21:48.797
And, um, I just wanted to
thank you for giving me a chance,

1122
01:21:48.863 --> 01:21:51.251
because it's an honor to work
with creative giants such as yourself.

1123
01:21:51.326 --> 01:21:54.710
<i>- Shutting up.
- You sure you can't come on tour with us?</i>

1124
01:21:54.783 --> 01:21:59.159
- Sorry. My place is here.
- Good answer.

1125
01:21:59.232 --> 01:22:02.298
Oh, well. Your loss.
One minute, insects!

1126
01:22:03.904 --> 01:22:05.759
I wanna thank all of you...

1127
01:22:05.824 --> 01:22:10.233
for giving us back our hope,
our dignity, and our lives.

1128
01:22:10.337 --> 01:22:14.331
And to you, Princess Atta.
You have given us so much.

1129
01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:17.369
Please accept this gift
from us bugs...

1130
01:22:17.441 --> 01:22:20.060
to you ants.

1131
01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:24.953
- For you!
- Oh! It's a rock.

1132
01:22:25.027 --> 01:22:27.394
What's with the rock?

1133
01:22:27.459 --> 01:22:29.313
Must be a circus thing.

1134
01:22:31.524 --> 01:22:33.793
Well, Flik, you really goofed up.

1135
01:22:33.859 --> 01:22:37.634
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you too.

1136
01:23:12.841 --> 01:23:16.802
All right.
Now it's gettin' mushy.

1137
01:23:16.873 --> 01:23:20.005
We're outta here! Hy-aah!

1138
01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:28.994
- Whoa!
- See ya next season!

1139
01:23:29.067 --> 01:23:31.522
- See ya, Flik!
- Bye! We miss you already!

1140
01:23:31.595 --> 01:23:34.792
- You fired!
- We forgot Heimlich!

1141
01:23:38.124 --> 01:23:42.947

This is the 15th take.
I cannot work like this.

Whoa, Flik honey, we are not about to...

Is someone hammering?

Could we hold the work, please? People?

1183
01:26:59.046 --> 01:27:00.956
Am I in this shot?
You can see me, right?

<i>- Okay, let's go for real now. Sorry.

Why go back to Ant Island at all?

- I mean, you don't even like grain.
- What?

1191
01:27:20.296 --> 01:27:22.151
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

Me?

01:27:36.746 --> 01:27:39.496
- This really hurts, guys. Can we cut? Ow!
- I'm sorry, I'm s...

1198
01:27:41.003 --> 01:27:44.232
So, is there a Mrs. Ant
you have to tunnel home to?

1199
01:27:44.299 --> 01:27:47.595
Oh, I'm sorry!
I thought he was real.

1200
01:27:47.659 --> 01:27:51.174
Ooh, dear.
Put that thing in my car.

Flik, after much deliberation...

1203
01:27:59.022 --> 01:28:01.990
- Ohh, I... Ow. Oh. My eye!

1204
01:28:02.062 --> 01:28:04.615
Oh. No, no. Seriously,
I've got berry juice in my eye!

It stings! Stop acting. I'm serious.

1206
01:28:07.439 --> 01:28:09.294
Oh, stop the camera!

1207
01:28:11.663 --> 01:28:13.932
Uh-oh. Towel!
I need a towel over here!

Can we... Can we cut? It's just
I don't think I'm comin' across.

1211
01:28:24.912 --> 01:28:28.077
Oh, oh, I know. I know.
I could lather up a bunch of spit.

1212
01:28:28.145 --> 01:28:30.927
Ooh, ooh, that's good.
I got it, J.L. One more for me.
