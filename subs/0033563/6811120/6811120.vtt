1
00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:30.424
Through the snow and sleet and hail,

2
00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.677
through the blizzard, through the gales,

3
00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:36.722
through the wind and through the rain,

4
00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:39.641
over mountain, over plain,

5
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:43.187
through the blinding lightning flash,

6
00:01:43.312 --> 00:01:46.773
and the mighty thunder crash,

7
00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:51.028
ever faithful, ever true,

8
00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:53.614
nothing stops him,

9
00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:55.908
he'll get through.

10
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:04.958
Look out for Mr. Stork
That persevering chap

11
00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:08.753
He'll come along and drop
a bundle in your lap

12
00:02:08.836 --> 00:02:11.798
You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which

13
00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:15.552
Millionaires, they get theirs
like the butcher and the baker

14
00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:19.139
So look out for Mr. Stork
and let me tell you, friend

15
00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:23.185
Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end

16
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.688
He'll spot you out in China
or he'll fly to County Cork

17
00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:30.192
So, you better look out for Mr. Stork

18
00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:22.077
Look out for Mr. Stork
He's got you on his list

19
00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:25.831
And when he comes around
It's useless to resist

20
00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:29.626
Remember those quintuplets
and the woman in the shoe

21
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.671
Maybe he's got his eye on you

22
00:05:19.862 --> 00:05:22.155
All aboard! All aboard!

23
00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:24.366
All aboard!

24
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.118
Let's go!

25
00:05:48.724 --> 00:05:51.310
Casey Junior's comin' down the track

26
00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:55.147
Comin' down the track
with a smoky stack

27
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.025
Hear him puffin'
Comin' round the hill

28
00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:02.029
Casey's here to thrill
every Jack and Jill

29
00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:05.157
Every time his
funny little whistle sounds

30
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.493
Everybody hurries to the circus grounds

31
00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:11.288
Time for lemonade and Cracker Jack

32
00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:14.541
Casey Junior's back
Casey Junior's back

33
00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.893
My, my.

34
00:06:33.477 --> 00:06:35.437
Now, let me see.

35
00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:38.941
Must be right around here somewhere.

36
00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:42.402
I hope. Watch it there.

37
00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:52.871
...on the treetop

38
00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.503
Where are we? Oh, here.

39
00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:05.342
Highway 61, four miles
to the gas station, turn left

40
00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.015
That must be it.

41
00:07:15.394 --> 00:07:18.063
Well, little fella, let's get going.

42
00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:41.670
Mrs. Jumbo. Oh, Mrs. Jumbo!

43
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.339
Calling Mrs. Jumbo.

44
00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:47.843
Mrs. Jumbo?

45
00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:52.472
Oh, my.

46
00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:56.476
Mrs. Jumbo!

47
00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.192
Oh, where's that Mrs. Jumbo?

48
00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:04.443
Over here!

49
00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:07.613
- This way, boy.
- In here, in here!

50
00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:09.990
This is the place.

51
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.658
At last.

52
00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:15.120
Which one of you ladies is expecting?

53
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.081
- Not me.
- The very idea!

54
00:08:18.207 --> 00:08:19.958
Certainly not! Over there.

55
00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:22.920
- Of course.
- Yes, of course. Right over there.

56
00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:26.798
Of course.

57
00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.433
"Here is a baby with eyes of blue,

58
00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:39.311
straight from heaven right to you."

59
00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:41.938
Or...

60
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:46.693
"Straight from heaven, up above,
here is a baby for you to love."

61
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.821
Sign here, please.

62
00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:56.411
Yeah, well... Oh, Mrs. Jumbo...

63
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.375
One moment, please.

64
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.877
This is still part of the service.

65
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.215
Happy birthday to you

66
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.218
Happy birthday to you

67
00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:14.263
Happy birthday dear...

68
00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:15.889
Dear...

69
00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.058
Dear me, what's his name?

70
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:21.186
Jumbo... Junior.

71
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.773
Oh, Jumbo Junior, huh? Jumbo Junior.

72
00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:28.819
Happy birthday, dear Jumbo Junior

73
00:09:28.944 --> 00:09:31.905
Happy birthday

74
00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:35.158
To

75
00:09:39.538 --> 00:09:41.290
You

76
00:09:45.002 --> 00:09:47.713
- Do hurry, dear.
- I'm on pins and needles.

77
00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:50.048
- Isn't it thrilling?
- I'm all aflutter.

78
00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:53.760
Oh, this is a proud, proud day.

79
00:09:53.844 --> 00:09:57.097
- Hurry and open it, dearie.
- I'm just dying to see.

80
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.146
- Look at him.
- Look at him.

81
00:10:07.983 --> 00:10:12.654
- Oh, you sweet little thing.
- He is cute, isn't he?

82
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.241
- Oh, he is a darling little angel.
- Adorable.

83
00:10:16.325 --> 00:10:19.036
Simply adorable.

84
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:22.039
Did you ever see anything so cunning?

85
00:10:22.164 --> 00:10:24.249
Isn't he a darling?

86
00:10:40.349 --> 00:10:43.185
- Is it possible?
- Isn't there some mistake?

87
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.771
Just look at those...

88
00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.565
...E-A-R-S.

89
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.983
Those what?

90
00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:52.236
Oh, ears!

91
00:10:52.361 --> 00:10:55.697
These! Aren't they funny?

92
00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.284
- Oh, my!
- My, what a temper.

93
00:10:59.368 --> 00:11:01.662
What did I do?
Tell me, did I say anything?

94
00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:04.915
- A perfectly harmless remark.
- I just said they're funny.

95
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.291
They certainly are.

96
00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:09.795
After all, who cares
about her precious little Jumbo?

97
00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:13.799
Jumbo? You mean Dumbo!

98
00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:15.676
Dumbo!

99
00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.723
- That's good.
- Dumbo, that's good!

100
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.815
I think I can, I think I can.
I think I can, I think I can.

101
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.276
I think I can, I think I can.

102
00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.653
I think I can.

103
00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:21.617
I... thought I could, I thought I could.
I thought I could, I thought I could.

104
00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:24.137
Hike! Hike! Hike! Hike!

105
00:13:24.263 --> 00:13:26.557
We work all day
We work all night

106
00:13:26.682 --> 00:13:28.642
We never learned to read or write

107
00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:33.063
We're happy-hearted roustabouts

108
00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:37.150
Hike! Hike! Hike! Hike!

109
00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:41.321
When other folks have gone to bed
We slave until we're almost dead

110
00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:45.200
We're happy-hearted roustabouts

111
00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:50.205
Hike! Hike! Hike! Hike!

112
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.666
We don't know when we get our pay

113
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:56.086
And when we do
We throw our pay away

114
00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:59.047
We get our pay
We throw our money all away

115
00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:01.258
We get our pay when children say

116
00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:04.761
With happy hearts
"It's circus day today"

117
00:14:04.887 --> 00:14:07.973
We get our pay
just watchin' kids on circus day

118
00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:12.269
Muscles achin'
Back near breakin'

119
00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:16.523
- Eggs and bacon's what we need
- Yes, sir

120
00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:20.861
Boss man houndin'
Keep on poundin'

121
00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:24.781
For your bed and feed

122
00:14:24.907 --> 00:14:27.242
There ain't no let-up

123
00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.119
Must get set up

124
00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:33.498
Pull that canvas
Drive that stake

125
00:14:33.582 --> 00:14:38.170
Want to doze off
Get them clothes off

126
00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:41.632
But must keep awake

127
00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.393
Swing that sledge and sing that song

128
00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:55.646
Work and laugh the whole night long

129
00:14:55.771 --> 00:14:58.899
Happy-hearted roustabouts

130
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.069
Pullin', poundin', tyin', groundin'

131
00:15:02.194 --> 00:15:04.404
Big top roundin' into shape

132
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.490
Keep on workin'
Stop that shirkin'

133
00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:08.700
Grab that rope, you hairy ape

134
00:15:08.784 --> 00:15:10.577
Poundin', poundin'

135
00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:12.663
Poundin', poundin'

136
00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:55.581
Oh, dear.

137
00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:30.235
...starts in exactly 15 minutes.

138
00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:32.738
Step right up and get your tickets...

139
00:18:32.863 --> 00:18:35.908
...the big side show
before you go into the big top.

140
00:18:35.991 --> 00:18:39.786
Fifteen big attractions that you can't
see anywhere else in the world.

141
00:18:39.912 --> 00:18:42.664
The greatest collection
in the entire world.

142
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:45.876
The greatest congress
of freaks ever assembled...

143
00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:49.171
Ain't that the funniest thing
you ever saw?

144
00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:50.714
Look at his ears!

145
00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:56.970
Hey, guys, look-it,
Skinny's an elephant.

146
00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.937
- You can't hide him.
- His ears are still sticking out.

147
00:19:05.062 --> 00:19:06.522
- Come on.
- Let's see him.

148
00:19:06.647 --> 00:19:08.941
- We want a laugh.
- That's what we came for.

149
00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:16.490
Biggest slingshot in the world!

150
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.701
- Hey! Cut that out.
- Let's get out of here.

151
00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:22.246
You're hurting me. Help! Murder!

152
00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:23.622
What's going on?

153
00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:29.127
Mrs. Jumbo, down! Surround her.

154
00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:31.380
Tie her down.

155
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.608
Calm down!

156
00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.444
Calm down!

157
00:19:54.528 --> 00:19:56.321
Tie her down!

158
00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:31.398
It was so funny!

159
00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:33.901
My dear, can you bear it?

160
00:20:34.026 --> 00:20:37.696
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.

161
00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:40.532
Well, personally,
I think she went a bit too far.

162
00:20:40.616 --> 00:20:43.243
After all, one mustn't
forget one is a lady.

163
00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:44.703
You're right, dear.

164
00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:47.664
Well, I suppose that's mother love.

165
00:20:47.748 --> 00:20:49.666
It's no excuse for what she did.

166
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.211
Mother love might cover
a multitude of sins.

167
00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:55.214
It's true, my dear...

168
00:20:55.339 --> 00:20:56.840
A guy can't eat in peace.

169
00:20:59.635 --> 00:21:02.137
Gab, gab, gab. Always gossiping.

170
00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:05.182
Girls, girls! Listen!

171
00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.893
Have I got a trunkful of dirt.

172
00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:10.187
- Darling, tell us.
- Go on!

173
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.314
Well, I heard today

174
00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:15.776
that they have put her
in solitary confinement.

175
00:21:15.901 --> 00:21:18.028
- No!
- You don't mean it!

176
00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:20.030
How awful for her.

177
00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:22.991
Well, I must say,
I don't blame her for anything.

178
00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.493
You're absolutely right.

179
00:21:24.618 --> 00:21:30.332
It's all the fault
of that little F-R-E-A-K.

180
00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:34.503
Yes, him with those ears
that only a mother could love.

181
00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:39.424
What's the matter with his ears?
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.

182
00:21:39.508 --> 00:21:41.385
I think they're cute.

183
00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:43.762
Ladies, ladies!

184
00:21:43.846 --> 00:21:45.973
It's no laughing matter at all.

185
00:21:46.098 --> 00:21:48.058
She's right, girls.

186
00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:51.603
Don't forget that we elephants
have always walked with dignity.

187
00:21:52.855 --> 00:21:55.983
- His disgrace is our own shame.
- That's true.

188
00:21:56.108 --> 00:21:58.944
- Indeed, it is.
- Well, frankly,

189
00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:01.989
I wouldn't eat at the
same bale of hay with him.

190
00:22:02.114 --> 00:22:03.407
Nor I.

191
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.410
- I should say so.
- That's just how I feel about it.

192
00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:08.537
Here he comes now.

193
00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:13.458
Pretend you don't see him.

194
00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:19.798
How do you like that?

195
00:22:19.882 --> 00:22:22.217
Givin' him the cold shoulder.

196
00:22:23.468 --> 00:22:25.429
Poor little guy.

197
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.515
There he goes,

198
00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.976
without a friend in the world.

199
00:22:32.561 --> 00:22:34.771
Nobody to turn to.

200
00:22:37.191 --> 00:22:39.276
I'll do something about this.

201
00:22:44.948 --> 00:22:46.158
A mouse!

202
00:22:52.164 --> 00:22:55.334
You like to pick on little guys?
Why don't you pick on me?

203
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.511
A proud race.

204
00:23:05.636 --> 00:23:07.888
Overstuffed hay bags.

205
00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:23.862
Still afraid of a mouse!

206
00:23:25.656 --> 00:23:27.866
Boy, wait till I tell the little guy.

207
00:23:27.991 --> 00:23:30.285
Where is he? Hey, Dumbo.

208
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.579
You can come out now.

209
00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:35.749
Golly, maybe I scared him too.

210
00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:39.044
Look, Dumbo, I'm your friend.

211
00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:41.213
Come on out, won't you?

212
00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:46.218
You're not really afraid
of little me, are you?

213
00:23:47.803 --> 00:23:49.179
You are?

214
00:23:49.263 --> 00:23:53.058
I must have overdid it in there.
I don't know my own strength sometimes.

215
00:23:55.477 --> 00:23:58.063
Dumbo, look what I got for you.

216
00:24:03.235 --> 00:24:05.195
You gotta come out first.

217
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:12.953
Too bad you don't trust me.

218
00:24:13.078 --> 00:24:17.249
'Cause I thought you and me, we might
get your mother out of the clink.

219
00:24:18.792 --> 00:24:22.087
But I guess you wouldn't be interested.
So long, Dumbo.

220
00:24:27.843 --> 00:24:29.678
Well, that's more like it.

221
00:24:29.803 --> 00:24:32.890
You know, your ma ain't crazy.

222
00:24:32.973 --> 00:24:35.350
She's just brokenhearted.

223
00:24:35.475 --> 00:24:38.020
It ain't nobody's fault
you got them big ears.

224
00:24:39.354 --> 00:24:41.064
Oh, boy. I stepped in it that time.

225
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.403
Gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.

226
00:24:47.946 --> 00:24:51.074
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I think they're very decorative.

227
00:24:51.992 --> 00:24:54.828
You know, lots of people
with big ears are famous.

228
00:24:56.288 --> 00:24:59.124
Oh, boy.
All we gotta do is build an act.

229
00:24:59.208 --> 00:25:00.751
Make you a star!

230
00:25:00.834 --> 00:25:02.252
A headliner!

231
00:25:02.336 --> 00:25:04.922
Dumbo the Great!

232
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.302
The great what?

233
00:25:13.138 --> 00:25:16.475
You know, Dumbo, we gotta get an idea.

234
00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:19.853
Not just any idea, something colossal.

235
00:25:19.978 --> 00:25:22.648
- Like...
- Have I got an idea!

236
00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:24.316
What an idea!

237
00:25:25.692 --> 00:25:28.403
- He never had an idea in his life.
- Just visualize.

238
00:25:28.529 --> 00:25:33.325
One elephant climbs up
on top of another elephant,

239
00:25:33.408 --> 00:25:36.828
until, finally, all 17 elephants

240
00:25:36.912 --> 00:25:42.000
have constructed
an enormous pyramid of pachyderms.

241
00:25:42.084 --> 00:25:44.670
I step out.

242
00:25:44.753 --> 00:25:46.964
I blow the whistle.

243
00:25:47.047 --> 00:25:49.550
The trumpets are trumpeting.

244
00:25:49.675 --> 00:25:51.426
- Yeah.
- And now...

245
00:25:51.552 --> 00:25:54.137
...comes the climax!

246
00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:57.474
Yeah? What is the climax?

247
00:25:58.892 --> 00:26:00.310
I don't know.

248
00:26:00.394 --> 00:26:02.771
I knew he never had nothin'.

249
00:26:02.896 --> 00:26:07.150
Well, maybe it comes
to me in a vision

250
00:26:07.234 --> 00:26:09.027
while I dream.

251
00:26:09.152 --> 00:26:12.030
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, boss.

252
00:26:12.114 --> 00:26:14.449
Climax?

253
00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:19.246
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.

254
00:26:20.873 --> 00:26:24.042
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.

255
00:27:20.015 --> 00:27:24.603
I am the voice
of your subconscious mind.

256
00:27:25.437 --> 00:27:27.439
Your inspiration.

257
00:27:28.148 --> 00:27:30.526
Now, concentrate.

258
00:27:33.737 --> 00:27:36.532
Remember, your pyramid
of elephants are in the ring,

259
00:27:36.657 --> 00:27:38.784
- waiting for a climax.
- Climax.

260
00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:42.704
- You are now getting that climax.
- Climax.

261
00:27:42.829 --> 00:27:45.165
How's the reception? Coming through OK?

262
00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:46.792
Good.

263
00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:49.545
Suddenly, from the sidelines
comes your climax.

264
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.591
Galloping across the arena,
he jumps from a springboard

265
00:27:54.675 --> 00:27:57.719
to a platform at the very pinnacle
of your pyramid.

266
00:27:57.845 --> 00:28:00.973
He waves a flag for a glorious finish.

267
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.143
And who is your climax?

268
00:28:06.353 --> 00:28:08.063
The elephant with the big ears.

269
00:28:08.188 --> 00:28:11.567
The world's mightiest midget mastodon,

270
00:28:11.692 --> 00:28:13.110
Dumbo!

271
00:28:15.946 --> 00:28:18.115
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo...

272
00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:20.450
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo!

273
00:28:20.534 --> 00:28:23.871
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo!

274
00:28:23.996 --> 00:28:26.164
I got it! I got it!

275
00:28:27.249 --> 00:28:30.335
Ladies and gentlemen,

276
00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.672
we will now present
for your entertainment

277
00:28:33.755 --> 00:28:37.426
the most stupendous, magnificent,

278
00:28:37.551 --> 00:28:40.596
super-colossal spectacle!

279
00:28:40.721 --> 00:28:46.059
On this tiny, little,
insignificant ball,

280
00:28:46.185 --> 00:28:48.645
we will construct for you

281
00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:52.649
a pyramid, not of wood, not of stone...

282
00:28:52.733 --> 00:28:56.528
To hear him talk,
you'd think he was going to do it.

283
00:28:56.612 --> 00:28:59.656
- ...a living, breathing pyramid
- The stuffed shirt.

284
00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.868
of ponderous, pulsating,

285
00:29:02.993 --> 00:29:07.039
pulchritudinous pachyderms.

286
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.210
I give you the elephants.

287
00:29:35.859 --> 00:29:37.778
Aren't we a bit clumsy?

288
00:29:46.036 --> 00:29:49.081
Gaining a little weight,
aren't you, honey?

289
00:29:49.206 --> 00:29:52.626
You're no cream puff yourself, dearie.

290
00:29:52.751 --> 00:29:55.712
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.

291
00:30:09.643 --> 00:30:11.937
Take your foot out of my eye.

292
00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.480
Clumsy ox.

293
00:30:19.361 --> 00:30:21.488
Steady, girls.

294
00:30:29.788 --> 00:30:31.999
Boy, that was a close one.

295
00:30:32.124 --> 00:30:33.876
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.

296
00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:35.794
Don't forget to wave that flag.

297
00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:38.297
OK, OK. Don't wave it no more.
I saw you.

298
00:30:39.173 --> 00:30:41.592
Now look, all you gotta do is run out,

299
00:30:41.675 --> 00:30:43.886
jump on the springboard.

300
00:30:44.011 --> 00:30:46.805
All right. Now show me
just how you're gonna do it.

301
00:30:47.848 --> 00:30:50.601
That's it. Thattaboy.
That's the stuff. Come on.

302
00:30:51.852 --> 00:30:53.270
Oh, Dumbo!

303
00:30:53.353 --> 00:30:55.981
Oh, those ears.
We got to do something, quick.

304
00:30:59.359 --> 00:31:01.486
Ladies and gentlemen,

305
00:31:01.612 --> 00:31:04.489
you have now seen the impossible

306
00:31:04.615 --> 00:31:06.825
accomplished in front of your faces.

307
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:09.995
Seven jungle giants,

308
00:31:10.078 --> 00:31:12.497
each one weighing
not one ounce less...

309
00:31:12.623 --> 00:31:15.375
That windbag.
Why doesn't he come to the point?

310
00:31:15.501 --> 00:31:19.171
...than 4,500 pounds. And now I present

311
00:31:19.254 --> 00:31:21.882
the world's smallest little elephant,

312
00:31:22.007 --> 00:31:25.886
who will spring from this springboard,

313
00:31:26.011 --> 00:31:30.557
in one spring,
to the top of this pyramid,

314
00:31:30.682 --> 00:31:32.392
waving his little flag

315
00:31:32.518 --> 00:31:35.646
for a grand climax.

316
00:31:35.729 --> 00:31:38.273
Ladies and gentlemen,

317
00:31:38.398 --> 00:31:41.860
I give you... Dumbo.

318
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:54.957
Go on! Get going.

319
00:31:55.082 --> 00:31:58.210
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo, that's your cue.

320
00:31:58.335 --> 00:32:00.379
You're on, Dumbo.

321
00:33:00.689 --> 00:33:03.817
Out of my way, assassin.

322
00:34:09.632 --> 00:34:13.762
I never thought I'd live
to see the big top fall.

323
00:34:13.846 --> 00:34:18.391
Because of that Dumbo,
I never can show my face there again.

324
00:34:18.475 --> 00:34:21.937
Look at my beautiful tail.

325
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:26.065
I'd just like to spank
the daylights out of him.

326
00:34:29.652 --> 00:34:33.072
That won't be necessary, dearie.

327
00:34:33.991 --> 00:34:36.409
They fixed him good.

328
00:34:36.493 --> 00:34:38.411
- What do you mean?
- What did they do?

329
00:34:38.495 --> 00:34:40.163
- Did they beat him?
- What is it?

330
00:34:40.289 --> 00:34:42.791
- Tell us.
- Come, come, I demand to know.

331
00:34:42.916 --> 00:34:44.960
Oh, well,

332
00:34:45.085 --> 00:34:48.964
they've gone and made him...
Oh, dear, I just can't say it.

333
00:34:49.047 --> 00:34:52.717
- Out with it!
- ...made him a clown.

334
00:34:52.842 --> 00:34:54.719
A clown!

335
00:34:54.844 --> 00:34:57.806
- No!
- Yes.

336
00:34:57.931 --> 00:35:01.143
Oh, the shame of it.

337
00:35:01.226 --> 00:35:03.979
Let us take the solemn vow.

338
00:35:06.273 --> 00:35:10.986
From now on,
he is no longer an elephant.

339
00:35:21.371 --> 00:35:25.083
Mr. Fireman, save my poor baby!

340
00:35:26.376 --> 00:35:29.171
Save my child!

341
00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:16.134
Save my baby!

342
00:36:29.815 --> 00:36:32.901
- Come on, jump.
- We'll save ya! Hurry up.

343
00:36:33.026 --> 00:36:35.696
- We'll save you.
- Come on, jump.

344
00:36:35.779 --> 00:36:37.406
Jump!

345
00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:55.549
Boy, did we wow 'em out there.

346
00:36:55.632 --> 00:36:57.426
- What a performance.
- We're good.

347
00:36:57.551 --> 00:36:59.428
Thirteen curtain calls! Thirteen!

348
00:36:59.511 --> 00:37:02.014
It sure brought down the house.

349
00:37:02.139 --> 00:37:04.558
Mama, did we panic 'em. Ask me.

350
00:37:04.641 --> 00:37:07.102
You said it,
we rolled them in the aisles.

351
00:37:07.186 --> 00:37:09.229
- Boy, what an act.
- What an act is right.

352
00:37:09.313 --> 00:37:10.772
Stupendous, I calls it.

353
00:37:10.856 --> 00:37:14.276
- They'll have respect for clowns now.
- Yeah, you bet.

354
00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:17.613
Boys, this calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.

355
00:37:17.696 --> 00:37:20.699
- Am I thirsty!
- I could use one of them.

356
00:37:20.824 --> 00:37:24.036
- This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.

357
00:37:24.161 --> 00:37:26.246
There's plaster in his eyes.

358
00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.874
See? They're drinking a toast to you.

359
00:37:28.999 --> 00:37:31.293
Yeah, you're a big hit.

360
00:37:36.215 --> 00:37:38.175
You're terrific.

361
00:37:41.178 --> 00:37:43.180
You're colossal, stupendous.

362
00:37:44.389 --> 00:37:47.184
Come on, alley-oop.
I gotta wash behind your ears.

363
00:37:48.393 --> 00:37:49.853
You ought to be proud.

364
00:37:50.562 --> 00:37:52.731
You're a success.

365
00:37:57.569 --> 00:37:59.446
Look! A peanut.

366
00:38:00.239 --> 00:38:03.075
Come on, eat it.
It's got lots of vitamins.

367
00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:08.205
It'll give you a lot of... pep.

368
00:38:12.042 --> 00:38:13.377
I forgot to tell you,

369
00:38:13.502 --> 00:38:16.547
we're going to see your mother.
I made an appointment.

370
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.466
Didn't I tell you?
Just like me. I must have forgot.

371
00:38:19.591 --> 00:38:20.926
Come on, get your hat.

372
00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:28.892
Right over there.

373
00:38:30.644 --> 00:38:32.479
Cozy little place, ain't it?

374
00:38:39.695 --> 00:38:42.239
Mrs. Jumbo.

375
00:38:42.364 --> 00:38:44.283
I hope she's in.

376
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.743
Someone to see you.

377
00:39:17.065 --> 00:39:22.529
Baby mine, don't you cry

378
00:39:24.823 --> 00:39:29.912
Baby mine, dry your eye

379
00:39:32.664 --> 00:39:37.377
Rest your head close to my heart

380
00:39:37.503 --> 00:39:42.090
Never to part, baby of mine

381
00:39:44.176 --> 00:39:49.389
Little one, when you play

382
00:39:51.016 --> 00:39:56.271
Don't you mind what they say

383
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.278
Let those eyes sparkle and shine

384
00:40:03.362 --> 00:40:07.991
Never a tear, baby of mine

385
00:40:39.606 --> 00:40:43.986
From your head to your toes

386
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:47.406
Baby mine

387
00:40:47.531 --> 00:40:52.661
You're so sweet, goodness knows

388
00:40:52.744 --> 00:40:55.998
Baby mine

389
00:40:56.081 --> 00:41:00.669
You are so precious to me

390
00:41:00.752 --> 00:41:05.257
Cute as can be, baby of mine

391
00:41:05.382 --> 00:41:07.676
Baby mine

392
00:41:07.759 --> 00:41:11.180
Baby mine

393
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.909
There you are.
Pour it in me slipper, Joey.

394
00:41:32.034 --> 00:41:35.037
Boy, I can't get over the way
we rolled them in the aisles.

395
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.830
Wait till we hit the big top.

396
00:41:36.955 --> 00:41:40.667
This gives me an idea. Raise the
platform the elephant jumps off of.

397
00:41:40.792 --> 00:41:43.378
Yeah. If they laugh
when he jumps 20 feet,

398
00:41:43.462 --> 00:41:46.757
they'll laugh twice as hard
if he jumps 40 feet.

399
00:41:46.882 --> 00:41:47.966
Yeah, that's right.

400
00:41:48.091 --> 00:41:50.594
- Simple mathematics.
- Let's make it 80 feet.

401
00:41:50.677 --> 00:41:53.055
Don't be a piker. Hundred and eighty.

402
00:41:53.138 --> 00:41:55.265
- Make it 300.
- A thousand.

403
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:56.934
Yeah, that's good.

404
00:41:57.059 --> 00:41:59.269
Be careful. You'll hurt the little guy.

405
00:41:59.394 --> 00:42:01.605
Go on. Elephants ain't got no feelings.

406
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.608
- They're made of rubber.
- This idea's sensational.

407
00:42:04.733 --> 00:42:07.110
- Let's go tell the boss.
- Yeah, let's go!

408
00:42:07.236 --> 00:42:11.448
- Hey, let's hit him for a raise.
- Yeah, sure! This is worth real dough.

409
00:42:11.573 --> 00:42:15.202
Oh, we're gonna
hit the big boss for a raise

410
00:42:15.327 --> 00:42:18.789
Yes, we're gonna
hit the big boss for a raise

411
00:42:18.872 --> 00:42:22.626
Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny

412
00:42:22.751 --> 00:42:26.088
We're gonna
hit the big boss for a raise

413
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:35.347
I know how you feel, Dumbo.
But you gotta pull yourself together.

414
00:42:35.472 --> 00:42:39.268
What would your mother think of you
if she saw you crying like this?

415
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:42.145
Remember, you come of a proud race.

416
00:42:43.772 --> 00:42:45.107
You're a...

417
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:47.734
...a pachyderm.
And pachyderms don't cry.

418
00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.778
What's crying get you, anyhow?

419
00:42:49.862 --> 00:42:51.697
Nothin' but the hiccups.

420
00:42:53.532 --> 00:42:54.950
There. You see?

421
00:42:59.454 --> 00:43:02.499
Well, ain't nothing
a little water won't cure.

422
00:43:03.709 --> 00:43:07.171
Upsadaisy.
We'll have you fixed up in a jiffy.

423
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.840
Come on.

424
00:43:14.386 --> 00:43:16.180
Here. Take a trunkful.

425
00:43:18.807 --> 00:43:23.478
Listen, little fella, we may have
had a lot of hard luck up till now,

426
00:43:23.562 --> 00:43:26.356
but you and me
is gonna do big things together.

427
00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.025
Hold your breath.

428
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.569
Why, your mother's
gonna be so proud of you.

429
00:43:30.694 --> 00:43:34.031
I'm gonna be proud of you too.
The circus is gonna be proud of you.

430
00:43:34.156 --> 00:43:37.034
What do you think of that? Swallow it.

431
00:43:38.577 --> 00:43:40.370
They can't keep us down.

432
00:43:42.956 --> 00:43:45.834
I guess you had
one little one left over.

433
00:43:45.918 --> 00:43:48.253
We'll bounce back so hard...

434
00:43:48.378 --> 00:43:50.589
Hey, what's the matter with you?

435
00:43:57.513 --> 00:43:59.556
What kind of water is this, anyhow?

436
00:44:53.235 --> 00:44:54.778
Balloonies.

437
00:44:56.488 --> 00:44:58.282
Hiya, George.

438
00:45:28.562 --> 00:45:31.148
That's a pretty "strick shlick."

439
00:45:32.232 --> 00:45:33.650
All right.

440
00:45:33.775 --> 00:45:37.654
Let's see you blow a square one, pal.

441
00:45:44.453 --> 00:45:47.998
Say, that's very, very clever.

442
00:45:48.081 --> 00:45:52.044
Now blow a great big one.

443
00:46:14.733 --> 00:46:16.693
It's a pretty... Hey!

444
00:46:20.656 --> 00:46:22.574
Dumbo!

445
00:46:23.492 --> 00:46:25.035
Do you see what I see?

446
00:47:33.812 --> 00:47:35.480
Look out
Look out

447
00:47:35.606 --> 00:47:37.566
Pink elephants on parade

448
00:47:37.649 --> 00:47:39.985
Here they come, hippity-hoppity

449
00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:43.530
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere

450
00:47:44.406 --> 00:47:46.450
Look out
Look out

451
00:47:46.533 --> 00:47:48.493
They're walking around the bed

452
00:47:48.619 --> 00:47:50.913
On their head, clippity-cloppity

453
00:47:50.996 --> 00:47:54.917
Arrayed in braid
Pink elephants on parade

454
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.960
What'll I do?
What'll I do?

455
00:47:57.085 --> 00:47:59.296
What an unusual view

456
00:47:59.421 --> 00:48:03.467
I can stand the sight of worms
and look at microscopic germs

457
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:07.471
But Technicolor pachyderms
is really too much for me

458
00:48:08.138 --> 00:48:12.059
I am not the type to faint
when things are odd or things are quaint

459
00:48:12.184 --> 00:48:16.522
But seein' things you know that ain't
can certainly give you an awful fright

460
00:48:16.647 --> 00:48:18.649
- What a sight
- Chase them away

461
00:48:18.732 --> 00:48:21.985
Chase them away
I'm afraid, need your aid

462
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.029
Pink elephants on parade

463
00:48:25.239 --> 00:48:27.157
Pink elephants

464
00:48:27.241 --> 00:48:29.576
Pink elephants

465
00:48:29.701 --> 00:48:31.286
Pink elephants

466
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:59.184
Well, looky here.

467
00:50:59.309 --> 00:51:02.771
My, my. Why, this is most irregular.

468
00:51:02.855 --> 00:51:05.440
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.

469
00:51:05.524 --> 00:51:06.984
They ain't dead, is they?

470
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:10.445
No, dead people don't snore.

471
00:51:10.529 --> 00:51:11.822
Or do they?

472
00:51:14.783 --> 00:51:17.661
What's all the ruckus?
Come on, step aside, brother.

473
00:51:19.288 --> 00:51:22.791
What's cookin' around here?
What's the good news? What's frying?

474
00:51:22.875 --> 00:51:26.795
- Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.

475
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.012
Well, hush my beak.

476
00:51:35.095 --> 00:51:38.849
- Go ahead, wake them up, brother.
- Yeah, find out what they're doing.

477
00:51:38.974 --> 00:51:40.684
- Yeah.
- Ask them what they want.

478
00:51:40.767 --> 00:51:42.519
OK, boys, leave it to me.

479
00:52:09.421 --> 00:52:11.715
Those pink elephants!

480
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:14.218
Pink elephants!

481
00:52:18.555 --> 00:52:20.349
What's so funny?

482
00:52:20.432 --> 00:52:22.392
What are you boys doing down here?

483
00:52:22.476 --> 00:52:24.645
What are we doing down here?

484
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.647
Well, hear him talk.

485
00:52:26.772 --> 00:52:29.149
Fly up a tree, where you belong.

486
00:52:31.735 --> 00:52:34.196
- Say, look here, brother rat.
- Brother rat!

487
00:52:34.279 --> 00:52:38.575
Listen, I ain't your brother,
and I ain't no rat! See?

488
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:44.122
And I suppose you and no elephant
ain't up in no tree either!

489
00:52:44.248 --> 00:52:46.583
No! Me in no tree and I'm no...

490
00:52:47.334 --> 00:52:48.877
Tree?

491
00:52:55.717 --> 00:52:57.427
Dumbo.

492
00:52:58.345 --> 00:53:00.097
Dumbo.

493
00:53:00.222 --> 00:53:02.099
Wake up, Dumbo!

494
00:53:04.184 --> 00:53:07.187
Don't look now,
but I think we're up in a tree.

495
00:53:37.467 --> 00:53:39.636
Don't pay attention to them scarecrows.

496
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.389
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.

497
00:53:42.931 --> 00:53:44.808
So long, boy.

498
00:53:52.816 --> 00:53:55.611
But I wonder how we ever
got up in that tree anyway.

499
00:53:58.405 --> 00:54:00.657
Now, let's see.

500
00:54:00.741 --> 00:54:03.493
Elephants can't climb trees, can they?

501
00:54:03.619 --> 00:54:05.245
No, that's ridiculous.

502
00:54:06.371 --> 00:54:07.873
Couldn't jump up.

503
00:54:08.582 --> 00:54:12.002
- It's too high.
- Hey there, son. Maybe you all flew up.

504
00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:14.838
Maybe we flew up.

505
00:54:14.963 --> 00:54:16.924
Yeah, maybe we...

506
00:54:17.049 --> 00:54:20.177
That's it! Dumbo, you flew!

507
00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.846
Am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?

508
00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:26.266
Your ears. Just look at them, Dumbo.
They're perfect wings.

509
00:54:26.391 --> 00:54:30.103
The very things that held you down
are gonna carry you up and up and up!

510
00:54:31.104 --> 00:54:33.357
I can see it all now.

511
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.984
Dumbo, the ninth wonder of the universe!

512
00:54:36.068 --> 00:54:38.362
The world's only flying elephant.

513
00:54:41.406 --> 00:54:43.367
Did you ever see an elephant fly?

514
00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:47.037
- Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- And I've seen a dragonfly.

515
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.081
I seen a housefly.

516
00:54:50.457 --> 00:54:52.709
I've seen all that too.

517
00:54:52.835 --> 00:54:55.045
I seen a peanut stand

518
00:54:55.128 --> 00:54:56.880
And heard a rubber band

519
00:54:57.005 --> 00:54:59.383
I seen a needle that winked its eye

520
00:54:59.967 --> 00:55:03.345
But I be done seen about everything

521
00:55:03.428 --> 00:55:06.390
- When I see a elephant fly
- What you say, boy?

522
00:55:06.473 --> 00:55:09.393
I said, when I see a elephant fly

523
00:55:09.476 --> 00:55:12.771
I seen a front porch swing
Heard a diamond ring

524
00:55:12.896 --> 00:55:16.066
I seen a polka-dot railroad tie

525
00:55:16.149 --> 00:55:19.736
But I be done seen about everything

526
00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.947
When I see a elephant fly

527
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.789
I saw a clothes horse
a-rear up and buck

528
00:55:30.914 --> 00:55:34.084
And they tell me that
a man made a vegetable truck

529
00:55:34.168 --> 00:55:37.087
I didn't see that, I only heard

530
00:55:37.171 --> 00:55:39.923
Just to be sociable, I'll take your word

531
00:55:40.007 --> 00:55:43.093
- I heard a fireside chat
- I saw a baseball bat

532
00:55:43.177 --> 00:55:45.762
I just laughed till I thought I'd die

533
00:55:45.846 --> 00:55:49.683
But I be done seen about everything

534
00:55:49.808 --> 00:55:52.311
When I see a elephant fly

535
00:56:05.532 --> 00:56:08.785
But I be done seen about everything

536
00:56:08.911 --> 00:56:11.455
When I see a elephant fly

537
00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.542
With the wind

538
00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:20.923
When I see a elephant

539
00:56:21.006 --> 00:56:24.676
Fly

540
00:56:31.558 --> 00:56:33.644
All right, you wise birds.

541
00:56:33.727 --> 00:56:35.687
This has gone far enough!

542
00:56:39.525 --> 00:56:41.235
Quiet, gentlemen.

543
00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.987
The Reverend Rodent
is gonna address you.

544
00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:46.823
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

545
00:56:46.907 --> 00:56:49.493
A bunch of big guys like you,

546
00:56:49.618 --> 00:56:52.037
picking on a poor
little orphan like him.

547
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.499
Suppose you was torn away
from your mother

548
00:56:55.582 --> 00:56:57.334
when you was just a baby.

549
00:56:57.417 --> 00:56:59.753
Nobody to tuck you in at nights.

550
00:56:59.878 --> 00:57:03.841
No warm, soft, caressing trunk
to snuzzle into.

551
00:57:05.008 --> 00:57:07.094
How would you like to be left out alone

552
00:57:07.219 --> 00:57:10.681
in a cold, cruel, heartless world?

553
00:57:10.764 --> 00:57:13.642
And why? I ask you, why?

554
00:57:13.725 --> 00:57:17.980
Just because he's got those big ears,
they call him a freak.

555
00:57:18.063 --> 00:57:20.315
The laughingstock of the circus.

556
00:57:20.399 --> 00:57:22.693
Then when his mother tried
to protect him,

557
00:57:22.818 --> 00:57:25.487
they threw her into the clink.

558
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:29.324
And on top of that,
they made him a clown.

559
00:57:29.408 --> 00:57:31.535
Socially, he's washed up.

560
00:57:32.411 --> 00:57:35.873
But what's the use of talking
to you cold-hearted birds?

561
00:57:36.748 --> 00:57:40.169
Go ahead, have your fun. Laugh at him.

562
00:57:40.252 --> 00:57:42.754
Kick him now that he's down. Go on!

563
00:57:44.673 --> 00:57:46.049
We don't care.

564
00:57:53.682 --> 00:57:55.309
Come on, Dumbo.

565
00:58:01.148 --> 00:58:03.400
Hey, brother, wait a minute.

566
00:58:03.483 --> 00:58:06.069
Don't go away feeling like that.

567
00:58:06.153 --> 00:58:08.155
We done seen the light.

568
00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:10.240
You boys is OK.

569
00:58:10.365 --> 00:58:12.409
Please. You've done enough.

570
00:58:12.534 --> 00:58:14.995
But we's all fixin' to help you.

571
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.080
Ain't that the truth, boys?

572
00:58:17.164 --> 00:58:19.416
Yeah, that's right.

573
00:58:19.499 --> 00:58:22.336
You want to make the elephant fly,
don't you?

574
00:58:22.461 --> 00:58:25.923
Well, you gotta use a lot of "cology."
You know, psychology.

575
00:58:26.048 --> 00:58:29.092
Here's what you do. First you...

576
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:33.096
Then, right after that, you...

577
00:58:36.517 --> 00:58:39.269
Use the magic feather. Catch on?

578
00:58:39.353 --> 00:58:44.066
The magic feather! Yeah. I got you.

579
00:58:44.149 --> 00:58:47.778
Dumbo, look! Have I got it!

580
00:58:47.861 --> 00:58:50.614
The magic feather. Now you can fly!

581
00:58:54.952 --> 00:58:58.455
Let's go. Let's go.

582
00:58:58.539 --> 00:59:02.084
- Heave-ho. Heave-ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.

583
00:59:02.167 --> 00:59:05.087
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on, now.

584
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:07.506
- Up, down! Up, down!
- Heave-ho. Heave-ho.

585
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:09.508
One, two! One, two!

586
00:59:09.633 --> 00:59:11.927
Faster! Get up flying speed!

587
00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:16.098
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage. Take off!

588
00:59:23.897 --> 00:59:25.566
It's no use.

589
00:59:25.691 --> 00:59:27.901
I guess it's just
another one of their...

590
00:59:28.026 --> 00:59:29.945
Look! Hot diggety!

591
00:59:30.028 --> 00:59:32.322
You're flying! You're flying!

592
00:59:36.034 --> 00:59:38.328
Why, he flies just like an eagle.

593
00:59:39.538 --> 00:59:41.623
Better than an airplane!

594
00:59:41.707 --> 00:59:43.959
Well, now I've seen everything.

595
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:49.798
Well, I've clean done seen
about everything

596
00:59:49.882 --> 00:59:52.676
When I see a elephant fly

597
00:59:54.344 --> 00:59:55.888
With the wind

598
00:59:56.597 --> 01:00:00.350
When I see an elephant

599
01:00:00.475 --> 01:00:03.312
Fly

600
01:00:03.395 --> 01:00:05.230
Dumbo, I knew you could do it!

601
01:00:06.064 --> 01:00:08.984
Wait till we get to the big town!

602
01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:12.279

603

Come on, jump. Jump!

605
01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:34.885
- We'll save you.
- Come on, jump.

606
01:00:38.263 --> 01:00:39.556
Look at that house.

607
01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:43.185
Dumbo, you're standing
on the threshold of success.

608
01:00:43.268 --> 01:00:45.896
Don't look down. It'll make you dizzy.

609
01:00:45.979 --> 01:00:48.941
Boy, are they in for a surprise.

610
01:00:50.943 --> 01:00:52.194

615
01:01:14.967 --> 01:01:18.387
Dumbo! Come on, fly! Open them ears!

616
01:01:19.513 --> 01:01:22.349
The magic feather was just a gag.

617
01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:25.602
Honest, you can. Hurry, open them up!

621
01:01:55.507 --> 01:01:57.134
Now, loop the loop.

You're making history!

623
01:02:52.898 --> 01:02:55.859
I seen a peanut stand
Heard a rubber band

624
01:02:55.984 --> 01:02:58.237

625
01:02:58.362 --> 01:03:02.533
But I be done seen about everything

626
01:03:03.742 --> 01:03:07.204

Happy landing, son!

634

When I see an elephant fly

635
01:03:28.433 --> 01:03:30.686
I wish I'd have got his autograph.

636
01:03:30.769 --> 01:03:32.563
Man, I got his autograph.

637
01:03:32.688 --> 01:03:35.315
So long, glamour boy.
