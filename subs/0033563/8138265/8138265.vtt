1
00:01:23.136 --> 00:01:26.975
Through the snow
and sleet and hail...

2
00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:30.253
through the blizzard,
through the gale...

3
00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:33.373
through the wind
and through the rain...

4
00:01:33.452 --> 00:01:36.252
over mountain, over plain...

5
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:39.530
through the blinding
lightning flash...

6
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.969
and the mighty thunder crash...

7
00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.047
ever faithful, ever true...

8
00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:49.366
nothing stops him.

9
00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:51.446
He'll get through.

10
00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:00.083
Look out for Mr. Stork
that persevering chap

11
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:03.521
He'll come along and drop
a bundle in your lap

12
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:06.800
You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which

13
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.318
Millionaires, they get theirs
like the butcher and the baker

14
00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.797
So look out for Mr. Stork
and let me tell you, friend

15
00:02:13.838 --> 00:02:17.796
Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end

16
00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:20.874
He'll spot you out in China
or he'll fly to County Cork

17
00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:24.193
So you'd better look out
for Mr. Stork

18
00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:14.135
Look out for Mr. Stork
He's got you on his list

19
00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:17.734
And when he comes around
it's useless to resist

20
00:03:17.813 --> 00:03:21.252
Remember those quintuplets
and the woman in the shoe

21
00:03:21.332 --> 00:03:24.610
Maybe he's got his eye on you

22
00:05:06.892 --> 00:05:09.091
All aboard! All aboard!

23
00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:12.890
All aboard! Let's go!

24
00:05:34.562 --> 00:05:37.041
Casey Junior's comin' down the track

25
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:40.880
Comin' down the track
with a smoky stack

26
00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:43.598
Hear him puffiin'
comin' round the hill

27
00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:47.356
Casey's here to thrill
every Jack and Jill

28
00:05:47.437 --> 00:05:50.476
Every time his funny
little whistle sounds

29
00:05:50.556 --> 00:05:53.674
Everybody hurries
to the circus grounds

30
00:05:53.755 --> 00:05:56.313
Time for lemonade and Cracker Jack

31
00:05:56.393 --> 00:05:59.592
Casey Junior's back
Casey Junior's back

32
00:06:13.987 --> 00:06:16.226
Oh. My, my.

33
00:06:17.746 --> 00:06:20.544
Now let me see.

34
00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:23.663
Must be right around here somewhere.

35
00:06:23.743 --> 00:06:25.983
I hope.
Ah, watch it there.

36
00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.458
On the treetop

37
00:06:40.057 --> 00:06:42.456
Where are we here?
Oh, here.

38
00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:47.014
Highway 61, four miles
to the gas station

39
00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:50.693
Turn left
Da-da da-da-da de

40
00:06:51.812 --> 00:06:54.212
Ah. That must be it.

41
00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.289
Well, little fella,
let's get goin'.

42
00:07:19.402 --> 00:07:23.480
Mrs. Jumbo. Oh, Mrs. Jumbo.

43
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:25.480
Calling Mrs. Jumbo.

44
00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.319
Mrs. Jumbo?

45
00:07:30.997 --> 00:07:32.837
Oh. My.

46
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.556
Mrs. Jumbo!

47
00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:44.673
- Oh, where's that Mrs. Jum...
- Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

48
00:07:44.752 --> 00:07:46.272
- Over here.
- This way, boy.

49
00:07:46.352 --> 00:07:48.031
- In here! In here!
- Yoo-hoo!

50
00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:51.630
- This is the place.
- Whew! At last.

51
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.909
Which one of you ladies
is expecting?

52
00:07:54.988 --> 00:07:57.788
- Hmph! Not me.
- The very idea.

53
00:07:57.867 --> 00:08:00.506
Certainly not.
Over there, of course.

54
00:08:00.587 --> 00:08:02.746
Yes, of course.
Right over there.

55
00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:06.104
Oh. Of course.

56
00:08:13.381 --> 00:08:15.381
Here is a baby with eyes of blue...

57
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.780
straight from heaven
right to you.

58
00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:22.738
Or: Straight from heaven
up above...

59
00:08:22.818 --> 00:08:25.138
here is a baby for you to love.

60
00:08:26.737 --> 00:08:29.135
Sign here, please.

61
00:08:31.695 --> 00:08:34.493
Uh, yeah. Well... Oh. Mrs. Jumbo.

62
00:08:37.853 --> 00:08:41.651
Uh, one moment, please.
This is still part of the service.

63
00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:45.849
Happy Birthday to you

64
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.888
Ah, Happy Birthday to you

65
00:08:48.969 --> 00:08:52.247
Ah, Happy Birthday, dear

66
00:08:52.327 --> 00:08:55.246
Ah, dear
Dear me. What's his name?

67
00:08:55.366 --> 00:08:58.245
Jumbo. Junior.

68
00:08:58.324 --> 00:09:00.884
Oh! Jumbo Junior, huh?
Ahem! Jumbo Junior.

69
00:09:02.004 --> 00:09:06.001
Happy Birthday, dear Jumbo Junior

70
00:09:06.082 --> 00:09:08.241
Happy Birthday

71
00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:15.758
To-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

72
00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:18.157
You

73
00:09:21.116 --> 00:09:23.835
- Oh, do hurry, dear.
- I'm on pins and needles.

74
00:09:23.956 --> 00:09:25.954
- Isn't it thrilling?
- I'm all a-flutter.

75
00:09:25.995 --> 00:09:29.593
Ah, this is a proud, proud day.

76
00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:32.632
- Well, hurry and open it, dearie.
- I'm just dying to see.

77
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:38.310
- Oh!
- Look at him!

78
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.869
Look at him!

79
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:43.068
Oh, what a... Oh, look!

80
00:09:43.108 --> 00:09:47.186
- Oh, you sweet little thing.
- He is cute, isn't he?

81
00:09:47.267 --> 00:09:50.146
Oh, he is a darling little baby.

82
00:09:50.181 --> 00:09:53.744
Adorable. Simply adorable.

83
00:09:53.784 --> 00:09:56.783
Did you ever see
anything so cunning?

84
00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:58.862
Isn't he a darling!

85
00:09:58.942 --> 00:10:03.021
Kootchy, kootchy, kootchy,
kootchy, kootchy, kootchy.

86
00:10:11.897 --> 00:10:14.056
- Oh!
- Oh!

87
00:10:14.137 --> 00:10:17.095
- Is it possible?
- Isn't there some mistake?

88
00:10:17.175 --> 00:10:19.894
Just look at those, those...

89
00:10:19.974 --> 00:10:22.613
E- A-R-S.

90
00:10:22.693 --> 00:10:26.211
Those what? Oh, ears!

91
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:29.930
These! Aren't they funny? Oh!

92
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.329
- Oh, my goodness.
- What a temper.

93
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.048
Oh, what did I do?
Well, tell me.

94
00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:36.208
- Did I say anything?
- Perfectly harmless remark.

95
00:10:36.288 --> 00:10:37.887
I just said that they're funny,
and they are funny.

96
00:10:37.967 --> 00:10:40.047
- They certainly are.
- After all, who cares...

97
00:10:40.126 --> 00:10:42.366
about her precious little Jumbo?

98
00:10:42.445 --> 00:10:45.884
Jumbo? You mean Dumbo.

99
00:10:45.964 --> 00:10:47.964
Dumbo.

100
00:10:49.763 --> 00:10:52.282
- Dumbo, I say.
- That's good.

101
00:10:52.322 --> 00:10:55.321
- Dumbo! That's good.
- Dumbo.

102
00:11:38.425 --> 00:11:41.863
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

103
00:11:41.943 --> 00:11:46.741
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can.

104
00:11:46.822 --> 00:11:50.740
I thought I could. I thought I could.
I thought I could. I thought I could.

105
00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:53.698
Whoo-woo!

106
00:12:47.758 --> 00:12:51.517
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh
hike, ugh, hike

107
00:12:51.597 --> 00:12:53.676
We work all day
We work all night

108
00:12:53.756 --> 00:12:55.516
We never learned
to read or write

109
00:12:55.595 --> 00:12:58.874
We're happy-hearted roustabouts

110
00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:03.672
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh
hike, ugh, hike

111
00:13:03.752 --> 00:13:06.151
When other folks have gone to bed

112
00:13:06.231 --> 00:13:08.790
We slave until we're almost dead

113
00:13:08.825 --> 00:13:11.349
We're happy-hearted roustabouts

114
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:16.468
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh
hike, ugh, hike

115
00:13:16.547 --> 00:13:18.627
We don't know when
we get our pay

116
00:13:18.706 --> 00:13:21.346
And when we do
we throw our pay away

117
00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:24.865
When we get our pay
we throw our money all away

118
00:13:24.944 --> 00:13:26.943
We get our pay when children say

119
00:13:27.024 --> 00:13:29.582
With happy hearts
It's circus day today

120
00:13:29.663 --> 00:13:33.341
Then we get our pay
just watching kids on circus day

121
00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:37.340
Muscles aching
Back near breaking

122
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.858
Eggs and bacon's what we need

123
00:13:40.938 --> 00:13:43.737
- Yes, sir!
- Boss man houndin'

124
00:13:43.817 --> 00:13:45.817
Keep on poundin'

125
00:13:45.896 --> 00:13:49.575
For your bread and keep

126
00:13:49.655 --> 00:13:51.894
There ain't no letup

127
00:13:51.974 --> 00:13:53.973
Got to set up

128
00:13:54.054 --> 00:13:56.053
Pull that canvas

129
00:13:56.132 --> 00:13:58.211
Drive that stake

130
00:13:58.292 --> 00:14:02.291
Want to doze off
Get them clothes off

131
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.609
But must keep awake

132
00:14:06.688 --> 00:14:10.527
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!

133
00:14:10.607 --> 00:14:14.925
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!
Hep! Heave! Hep!

134
00:14:15.006 --> 00:14:17.004
Swing that sledge
Sing that song

135
00:14:17.085 --> 00:14:18.924
Work and laugh
the whole night long

136
00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:21.963
You happy-hearted roustabouts

137
00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:25.402
Pullin: poundin'
tyin: groundin'

138
00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:27.400
Big top roundin' into shape

139
00:14:27.481 --> 00:14:29.320
Keep on workin'
Stop that shirkin'

140
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.639
Grab that rope, you hairy ape

141
00:14:31.719 --> 00:14:35.718
Poundin: poundin'

142
00:14:35.797 --> 00:14:39.556
Oh

143
00:17:43.287 --> 00:17:45.131
Jostling and juggling.
Fifteen minutes!

144
00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:47.246
Step right up and get your tickets.
Hurry, hurry now.

145
00:17:47.325 --> 00:17:50.285
Hurry to the big sideshow.
That's why you go under the big top.

146
00:17:50.404 --> 00:17:54.043
Fifteen big attractions that you
can't see anywhere else in the world!

147
00:17:54.123 --> 00:17:56.442
The greatest collection
in the entire world.

148
00:17:56.522 --> 00:18:00.880
And the greatest comedies are featured
and assembled for your entertainment.

149
00:18:01.001 --> 00:18:04.759
Ain't that the funniest thing
you ever saw? Look at his ears.

150
00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.517
Hey, guys, look it!
Smitty's an elephant!

151
00:18:13.756 --> 00:18:15.515
- Aw, let me see!
- Boo!

152
00:18:15.635 --> 00:18:18.194
- You can't hide him from us.
- Yeah, his ears are still stickin' out.

153
00:18:18.274 --> 00:18:19.753
- Come on!
- We wanna see him!

154
00:18:19.873 --> 00:18:22.672
- We wanna laugh.
- Sure, that's what we came for.

155
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.389
Hey, the biggest slingshot
in the world.

156
00:18:30.429 --> 00:18:32.509
- Hey! Cut that out!
- Hey, let's get out of here.

157
00:18:32.588 --> 00:18:36.267
- You're hurting me! Help!
- Here, you! What's going on?

158
00:18:38.346 --> 00:18:40.385
Down. Mrs. Jumbo, down!

159
00:18:40.425 --> 00:18:43.144
Surround her. Tie her down.

160
00:19:01.377 --> 00:19:03.617
Get down!

161
00:19:03.696 --> 00:19:06.496
Calm down! Tie her down!

162
00:19:39.284 --> 00:19:41.282
Darling, it was so funny.

163
00:19:41.363 --> 00:19:43.522
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?

164
00:19:43.601 --> 00:19:47.280
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.

165
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.000
Well, personally, I think
she went a bit too far.

166
00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:52.398
After all, one mustn't forget
one is a lady.

167
00:19:52.479 --> 00:19:54.118
- Oh, you're right, dear. Yes.
- Oh, that's very true.

168
00:19:54.157 --> 00:19:56.476
Oh, well, I suppose
that's mother love.

169
00:19:56.557 --> 00:19:58.795
But it's certainly no excuse
for what she did.

170
00:19:58.836 --> 00:20:01.755
Mother love might cover
a multitude of sins.

171
00:20:01.835 --> 00:20:04.154
It's true, my dear,
and she has such a streak in...

172
00:20:04.234 --> 00:20:06.153
A guy can't eat in peace.

173
00:20:06.233 --> 00:20:08.152
Yes, but mother love does...

174
00:20:08.233 --> 00:20:10.351
Gab, gab, gab.
Always gossipin'.

175
00:20:10.392 --> 00:20:13.670
Girls, girls! Listen!

176
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.109
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.

177
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:18.948
- Well, darling, tell us all.
- Go on, go on.

178
00:20:19.028 --> 00:20:23.427
Well, I heard today that they have
put her in solitary confinement.

179
00:20:23.466 --> 00:20:25.426
- No!
- You don't mean it!

180
00:20:25.506 --> 00:20:27.905
Oh, how awful for her!

181
00:20:27.985 --> 00:20:30.704
Well, I-I must say,
I- I don't blame her for anything.

182
00:20:30.784 --> 00:20:34.383
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little...

183
00:20:34.462 --> 00:20:37.422
F- R-E-A-K.

184
00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:41.740
Yes, him with those ears
that only a mother could love.

185
00:20:43.019 --> 00:20:44.858
What's the matter with his ears?

186
00:20:44.939 --> 00:20:47.897
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.

187
00:20:49.097 --> 00:20:52.456
Ladies, ladies!
It's no laughing matter at all.

188
00:20:52.535 --> 00:20:54.695
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.

189
00:20:54.775 --> 00:20:59.094
Don't forget that we elephants
have always walked with dignity.

190
00:20:59.173 --> 00:21:01.452
His disgrace is our own shame.

191
00:21:01.573 --> 00:21:03.411
- Yes, that's true. That's very true.
- Oh, indeed it is.

192
00:21:03.492 --> 00:21:08.049
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat
at the same bale of hay with him.

193
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.409
- No. Right.
- Me either, dearie.

194
00:21:09.449 --> 00:21:12.088
- I should say.
- Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.

195
00:21:12.129 --> 00:21:14.448
Here he comes now.

196
00:21:14.527 --> 00:21:18.126
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.

197
00:21:18.206 --> 00:21:20.605
Shh.

198
00:21:23.644 --> 00:21:27.242
How do ya like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.

199
00:21:28.602 --> 00:21:31.401
Poor little guy.

200
00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:35.639
There he goes,
without a friend in the world.

201
00:21:37.439 --> 00:21:39.398
Nobody to turn to.

202
00:21:41.157 --> 00:21:44.357
Oh, I'll do somethin' about this.

203
00:21:49.234 --> 00:21:51.074
A mouse!

204
00:21:56.031 --> 00:21:57.951
So ya like to pick
on little guys, huh?

205
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:00.590
Well, why don't you pick on me?

206
00:22:06.908 --> 00:22:09.067
A proud race.

207
00:22:09.147 --> 00:22:11.306
Overstuffed hay bags!

208
00:22:22.102 --> 00:22:24.501
Boo!

209
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:27.060
Still afraid of a mouse.

210
00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.259
Ho-ho, boy.
Wait'll I tell the little guy.

211
00:22:30.339 --> 00:22:32.978
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.

212
00:22:33.057 --> 00:22:35.617
You can come out now.

213
00:22:35.697 --> 00:22:38.975
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.

214
00:22:39.056 --> 00:22:41.134
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.

215
00:22:41.215 --> 00:22:43.134
Come on out, won't ya?

216
00:22:44.893 --> 00:22:48.012
You're not really afraid
of little me, are ya?

217
00:22:49.612 --> 00:22:51.850
Ya are?
Must've overdid it in there.

218
00:22:51.931 --> 00:22:54.569
Don't know my own strength sometimes.

219
00:22:56.809 --> 00:22:59.367
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.

220
00:23:03.287 --> 00:23:06.245
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Ya gotta come out first.

221
00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:14.322
Too bad ya don't trust me,
'cause I thought...

222
00:23:14.402 --> 00:23:19.040
uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we
might get your mother out of the clink.

223
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.919
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't
be interested. So long, Dumbo.

224
00:23:27.837 --> 00:23:30.236
Well, that's more like it.

225
00:23:30.316 --> 00:23:32.796
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.

226
00:23:32.875 --> 00:23:35.194
She's just brokenhearted.

227
00:23:35.275 --> 00:23:38.953
It ain't nobody's fault
you got them big ears.

228
00:23:39.033 --> 00:23:42.151
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped in it that time.

229
00:23:42.232 --> 00:23:47.030
Aw, gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.

230
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.869
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I think they're very decorative.

231
00:23:50.948 --> 00:23:54.707
You know, lots of people
with big ears are famous.

232
00:23:54.787 --> 00:23:57.906
Ho-ho, boy.
All we gotta do is build an act.

233
00:23:57.986 --> 00:24:00.944
Make ya a star. A headliner!

234
00:24:01.025 --> 00:24:03.184
Dumbo the Great!

235
00:24:06.142 --> 00:24:08.782
Uh-oh. The great what?

236
00:24:10.541 --> 00:24:14.539
Ya know, Dumbo,
we gotta get an idea.

237
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.378
Not just any idea.
Something colossal, like, uh...

238
00:24:18.458 --> 00:24:22.056
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!

239
00:24:22.137 --> 00:24:24.296
Huh. He never had an idea
in his life.

240
00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:28.534
Just visualize:
One elephant climbs up...

241
00:24:28.615 --> 00:24:31.733
on top of another elephant
until finally...

242
00:24:31.813 --> 00:24:33.972
all 17 elephants...

243
00:24:34.052 --> 00:24:37.331
have constructed
an enormous pyramid...

244
00:24:37.411 --> 00:24:39.410
of pachyderms.

245
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.889
I step out.

246
00:24:41.969 --> 00:24:43.809
I blow the whistle.

247
00:24:43.888 --> 00:24:46.207
- Yeah.
- The trumpets are trumpeting.

248
00:24:46.288 --> 00:24:48.047
- Yeah.
- And now...

249
00:24:48.127 --> 00:24:50.366
comes the climax!

250
00:24:51.805 --> 00:24:54.205
Yeah? What is the climax?

251
00:24:54.284 --> 00:24:56.603
Hmm. I don't know.

252
00:24:56.684 --> 00:24:58.922
I knew he never had nothin'.

253
00:24:59.003 --> 00:25:01.801
Well, maybe it comes to me...

254
00:25:01.882 --> 00:25:05.400
in a vision while I dream.

255
00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:07.800
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Boss.

256
00:25:07.879 --> 00:25:09.719
Climax.

257
00:25:11.078 --> 00:25:14.757
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.

258
00:25:16.197 --> 00:25:18.995
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.

259
00:26:12.975 --> 00:26:17.054
I am the voice
of your subconscious mind.

260
00:26:18.093 --> 00:26:20.572
Your inspiration.

261
00:26:20.652 --> 00:26:23.051
Now, concentrate.

262
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.610
Remember?
Your pyramid of elephants...

263
00:26:27.689 --> 00:26:29.769
are standing in the ring
waitin' for a climax.

264
00:26:29.848 --> 00:26:33.528
- Climax.
- You are now getting that climax.

265
00:26:33.607 --> 00:26:35.526
- Climax.
- How's the reception?

266
00:26:35.606 --> 00:26:38.645
Comin' through okay? Good.

267
00:26:38.726 --> 00:26:41.124
Suddenly, from the sidelines,
comes your climax.

268
00:26:41.205 --> 00:26:43.443
- Climax.
- Gallopin' across the arena.

269
00:26:43.524 --> 00:26:45.843
- Arena.
- He jumps from a springboard...

270
00:26:45.922 --> 00:26:47.362
to a platform.

271
00:26:47.442 --> 00:26:50.560
At the very pinnacle of your pyramid,
he waves a flag...

272
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:52.240
for a glorious finish!

273
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.158
- Finish?
- And who is your climax?

274
00:26:57.278 --> 00:26:59.037
The little elephant
with the big ears!

275
00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:04.316
The world's mightiest
midget mastodon! Dumbo!

276
00:27:04.395 --> 00:27:06.235
What?

277
00:27:06.314 --> 00:27:14.152
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

278
00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:16.151
I got it! I got it!

279
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.309
Ladies and gentlemen...

280
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.668
we will now present
for your entertainment...

281
00:27:23.748 --> 00:27:26.947
the most stupendous, magnificent...

282
00:27:27.027 --> 00:27:30.226
super-colossal spectacle.

283
00:27:30.305 --> 00:27:32.545
On this tiny...

284
00:27:32.624 --> 00:27:35.584
little, insignificant ball...

285
00:27:35.663 --> 00:27:37.743
we will construct for you...

286
00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:41.581
a pyramid, not of wood,
not of stone...

287
00:27:41.662 --> 00:27:44.541
To hear him talk,
you'd think he was going to do it.

288
00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.339
- but a living, breathing...
- The stuffed shirt.

289
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.258
pyramid of ponderous, pulsating...

290
00:27:51.338 --> 00:27:55.576
pulchritudinous pachyderms!

291
00:27:56.856 --> 00:27:58.855
I give you the elephants.

292
00:28:23.246 --> 00:28:25.085
Aren't we a bit clumsy?

293
00:28:33.242 --> 00:28:35.961
Gaining a little weight,
aren't you, honey?

294
00:28:36.041 --> 00:28:39.240
You're no cream puff
yourself, dearie.

295
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.278
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.

296
00:28:55.473 --> 00:28:59.312
Take your foot out of my eye,
clumsy ox.

297
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.989
Steady, girls.

298
00:29:14.907 --> 00:29:17.305
Boy, that was a close one.

299
00:29:17.385 --> 00:29:20.744
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.

300
00:29:20.824 --> 00:29:23.623
Okay, okay.
Don't wave it no more. I saw ya.

301
00:29:23.703 --> 00:29:26.262
Now, look. All ya gotta do
is run out, see?

302
00:29:26.342 --> 00:29:28.261
Jump on the springboard.

303
00:29:28.342 --> 00:29:32.020
All right, now show me
just how you're gonna do it.

304
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.059
That's it. Attaboy.
That's the stuff. Come on.

305
00:29:35.139 --> 00:29:37.458
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!

306
00:29:37.537 --> 00:29:40.017
Oh, those ears.
We gotta do somethin', quick.

307
00:29:43.136 --> 00:29:45.260
Ladies and gentlemen...

308
00:29:45.295 --> 00:29:48.174
you have now seen the impossible...

309
00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:50.573
accomplished in front of your faces.

310
00:29:50.653 --> 00:29:53.212
Seven jungle giants...

311
00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:55.131
each one weighing not...

312
00:29:55.212 --> 00:29:56.730
That windbag!

313
00:29:56.811 --> 00:29:59.529
- Why doesn't he come to the point?
- 7,500 pounds!

314
00:29:59.609 --> 00:30:01.769
And now, I present...

315
00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:04.967
the world's smallest
little elephant...

316
00:30:05.048 --> 00:30:08.886
who will spring
from this springboard...

317
00:30:08.966 --> 00:30:10.966
in one spring...

318
00:30:11.045 --> 00:30:14.884
to the top of this pyramid,
waving his little flag...

319
00:30:14.963 --> 00:30:18.083
for a grand climax!

320
00:30:18.162 --> 00:30:20.562
Ladies and gentlemen...

321
00:30:20.641 --> 00:30:23.760
I give you Dumbo!

322
00:30:34.157 --> 00:30:36.395
Go on! Get goin'!

323
00:30:36.476 --> 00:30:39.595
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo! That's your cue!

324
00:30:39.674 --> 00:30:41.593
You're on, Dumbo.

325
00:31:39.652 --> 00:31:42.211
Out of my way, assassin!

326
00:32:44.108 --> 00:32:46.187
- Dear!
- Ohh.

327
00:32:46.267 --> 00:32:50.310
I never thought I'd live
to see the big top fall.

328
00:32:50.345 --> 00:32:54.824
Because of that Dumbo,
I never can show my face there again.

329
00:32:54.903 --> 00:32:58.022
Oh, look at my beautiful tail!

330
00:32:58.103 --> 00:33:01.541
I'd just like to spank
the daylights out of him...

331
00:33:01.621 --> 00:33:05.380
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh.

332
00:33:05.459 --> 00:33:09.458
Oh, that won't be necessary, dearie.

333
00:33:09.538 --> 00:33:11.937
They fixed him good.

334
00:33:12.017 --> 00:33:13.857
- What do you mean?
- Wh-What did they do?

335
00:33:13.936 --> 00:33:15.536
- Did they beat him?
- What is it, darling?

336
00:33:15.616 --> 00:33:18.095
- Tell us.
- Come, come. I demand to know.

337
00:33:18.174 --> 00:33:22.138
Oh. Well, they've gone and made him...

338
00:33:22.173 --> 00:33:24.972
- Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
- Out with it!

339
00:33:25.052 --> 00:33:27.771
Made him a clown.

340
00:33:27.851 --> 00:33:29.690
A clown?

341
00:33:29.771 --> 00:33:32.489
- No!
- Yes.

342
00:33:32.569 --> 00:33:36.088
Oh, the shame of it.

343
00:33:36.168 --> 00:33:38.567
Let us take the solemn vow.

344
00:33:40.566 --> 00:33:44.165
From now on, he is no longer...

345
00:33:44.245 --> 00:33:46.084
an elephant.

346
00:33:54.321 --> 00:33:58.799
Please! Help me save
my poor baby!

347
00:33:58.834 --> 00:34:02.478
Whoo! Save my child!

00:34:12.394 --> 00:34:14.314
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Whew! Boy, oh, boy,

356
00:35:25.447 --> 00:35:27.246
- What a performance!
- Are we good?

357
00:35:27.326 --> 00:35:29.005
Thirteen curtain calls.

358
00:35:29.085 --> 00:35:31.004
Yeah, sure brought down
the house, all right.

359
00:35:31.085 --> 00:35:34.043
Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me.

360
00:35:34.124 --> 00:35:36.008
You said it.
We rolled 'em in the aisles.

361
00:35:36.043 --> 00:35:38.281
- Boy, oh, boy, what an act.
- Oh, "what an act" is right.

362
00:35:38.362 --> 00:35:39.921
Stupendous, I call it.

363
00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:41.801
They'll have more respect
for us clowns now.

364
00:35:41.836 --> 00:35:43.880
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- Here, boys.

365
00:35:43.919 --> 00:35:46.404
This calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.

366
00:35:46.439 --> 00:35:49.557
- Poison! Am I thirsty.
- I could use one of them myself.

367
00:35:49.638 --> 00:35:51.436
- This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.

368
00:35:51.557 --> 00:35:54.755
- Dumbo!
- Here's plaster in his eyes.

369
00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:57.395
See? They're drinkin'
a toast to ya.

370
00:35:57.435 --> 00:35:59.554
Yeah. You're a big hit.

371
00:36:03.792 --> 00:36:05.871
Why, uh, you're terrific.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:10.430
Oh, you're colossal. Stupendous.

00:36:31.781 --> 00:36:34.421

00:36:37.379 --> 00:36:39.419

Oh. Right over there.

Cozy little place, ain't it?

385
00:37:05.369 --> 00:37:09.047
Mrs. Jumbo. I hope she's in.

386
00:37:10.087 --> 00:37:12.886
Someone to see ya.

387
00:37:40.715 --> 00:37:43.634
Baby mine

388
00:37:43.675 --> 00:37:47.993
Don't you cry

389
00:37:48.073 --> 00:37:50.952
Baby mine

390
00:37:51.032 --> 00:37:55.511
Dry your eyes

391
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.069
Rest your head

392
00:37:58.149 --> 00:38:00.149
Close to my heart

393
00:38:00.228 --> 00:38:02.387
Never to part

394
00:38:02.468 --> 00:38:05.107
Baby of mine

395
00:38:06.466 --> 00:38:09.385
Little one

396
00:38:09.425 --> 00:38:13.383
When you play

397
00:38:13.503 --> 00:38:16.382
Don't you mind

398
00:38:16.463 --> 00:38:20.461
What they say

399
00:38:20.541 --> 00:38:23.140
Let those eyes

400
00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.019
Sparkle and shine

401
00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:27.418
Never a tear

402
00:38:27.498 --> 00:38:31.736
Baby of mine

403
00:38:59.726 --> 00:39:02.605
From your head

404
00:39:02.685 --> 00:39:04.364
To your toes

405
00:39:04.444 --> 00:39:07.323
Baby mine

406
00:39:07.364 --> 00:39:12.121
You're so sweet
goodness knows

407
00:39:12.201 --> 00:39:15.320
Baby mine

408
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.039

409
00:39:18.074 --> 00:39:19.799

410
00:39:19.839 --> 00:39:24.437
Cute as can be
baby of mine

411
00:39:24.472 --> 00:39:34.113
Baby mine

412
00:39:46.748 --> 00:39:49.787
Here ya are.
Pour it in me slipper, Joey.

413
00:39:49.827 --> 00:39:52.666
Boy, I can't get over the way
we rolled 'em in the aisles.

414
00:39:52.746 --> 00:39:55.784
- Just wait'll we hit the big town.
- This gives me an idea.

415
00:39:55.825 --> 00:39:58.184
Let's raise the platform
the elephant jumps off of.

416
00:39:58.264 --> 00:40:00.743
Yeah! If they laugh
when he jumps 20 feet...

417
00:40:00.823 --> 00:40:03.542
they'll laugh twice as hard
if he jumps 40 feet.

418
00:40:03.581 --> 00:40:06.501
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Simple mathematics.

419
00:40:06.581 --> 00:40:10.020
- Let's make it 80 feet.
- Don't be a piker. 180.

420
00:40:10.099 --> 00:40:11.939
- Make it 300.
- A thousand.

421
00:40:12.019 --> 00:40:14.658
- Yeah, that's good.
- Hey, be careful.

422
00:40:14.738 --> 00:40:16.657
- You'll hurt the little guy.
- Aw, go on.

423
00:40:16.737 --> 00:40:19.456
- Elephants ain't got no feelings.
- No, they're made of rubber.

424
00:40:19.576 --> 00:40:22.255
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.

425
00:40:22.335 --> 00:40:23.695
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

426
00:40:23.774 --> 00:40:25.533
Hey, hey!
Let's hit him for a raise.

427
00:40:25.574 --> 00:40:27.773
Yeah, sure.
This is worth real dough.

428
00:40:27.813 --> 00:40:31.331
Oh, we're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise

429
00:40:31.372 --> 00:40:34.810
Yes, we're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise

430
00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.649
Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny

431
00:40:38.729 --> 00:40:41.808
We're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise

432
00:40:47.045 --> 00:40:50.644
I know how ya feel, Dumbo,
but you gotta pull yourself together.

433
00:40:50.724 --> 00:40:54.563
What would your mother think of ya,
if she saw you crying like this?

434
00:40:54.643 --> 00:40:57.282
Remember, you come of a proud race.

435
00:40:58.641 --> 00:41:00.881
Why you're a-a-a... a pachyderm...

436
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.800
and pachyderms don't cry.

437
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.838
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.

438
00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:09.837
There. Ya see?

439
00:41:13.795 --> 00:41:17.794
Well, ain't nothin'
a little water won't cure.

440
00:41:17.914 --> 00:41:20.713
Oops-a-daisy. We'll have ya
fixed up in a jiffy.

441
00:41:21.752 --> 00:41:23.552
Come on.

442
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.149
Here. Take a trunk full.

443
00:41:32.149 --> 00:41:33.988
Listen, little fella.

444
00:41:34.068 --> 00:41:36.707
We may have had a lot
of hard luck up till now...

445
00:41:36.787 --> 00:41:39.906
but you and me is gonna do
big things together.

446
00:41:39.985 --> 00:41:43.744
Hold your breath. Why, your mother's
gonna be so proud of ya.

447
00:41:43.784 --> 00:41:45.304
I'm gonna be proud of ya too.

448
00:41:45.424 --> 00:41:48.463
The whole circus is gonna be proud
of ya. Now, what do ya think of that?

449
00:41:48.542 --> 00:41:50.462
Swallow it.

450
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:52.941
Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.

451
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.419
Oh, I guess you had
one little one left over.

452
00:41:57.499 --> 00:42:00.778
Dumbo, we'll bounce back so ha...

453
00:42:00.858 --> 00:42:03.657
Hey, what's the matter with you?

454
00:42:09.295 --> 00:42:12.134
What kind of water is this, anyhow?

455
00:43:03.035 --> 00:43:05.873
Balloonies.

456
00:43:05.953 --> 00:43:07.872
Hiya, George.

457
00:43:27.265 --> 00:43:29.944
Whee!

458
00:43:36.582 --> 00:43:40.260
That's a pretty
schstrick schlick.

459
00:43:40.341 --> 00:43:45.298
All right. Let's see ya
blow a square one, pal.

460
00:43:52.015 --> 00:43:55.215
Say, that's very, very clever.

461
00:43:55.295 --> 00:43:59.613
Now blow a great big one.

462
00:44:20.805 --> 00:44:22.644
That's a pretty sh... Hey!

463
00:44:26.963 --> 00:44:29.282
Dumbo.

464
00:44:29.362 --> 00:44:31.761
You see what I see?

465
00:45:36.457 --> 00:45:40.295
Look out, look out
Pink elephants on parade

466
00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:42.694
Here they come
Hippity-hoppity

467
00:45:42.774 --> 00:45:46.772
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere

468
00:45:46.853 --> 00:45:48.932
Look out, look out

469
00:45:49.012 --> 00:45:51.811
They're walking around the bed
on their head

470
00:45:51.846 --> 00:45:54.690
Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid

471
00:45:54.725 --> 00:45:57.009
Pink elephants on parade

472
00:45:57.088 --> 00:45:59.008
- What'll I do
- What'll I do

473
00:45:59.088 --> 00:46:01.247
What an unusual view

474
00:46:01.327 --> 00:46:05.086
I can stand the sight of worms
and look at microscopic germs

475
00:46:05.165 --> 00:46:09.484
But Technicolor pachyderms
is really too much for me

476
00:46:09.564 --> 00:46:11.403
I am not the type to faint

477
00:46:11.483 --> 00:46:13.402
When things are odd
or things are quaint

478
00:46:13.483 --> 00:46:15.402
But seein' things
you know there ain't

479
00:46:15.482 --> 00:46:17.961
Can certainly give you
an awful fright

480
00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.840
What a sight
Chase 'em away, chase 'em away

481
00:46:20.919 --> 00:46:24.599
I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade

482
00:46:24.678 --> 00:46:26.997
- Hey, hey, hey
- Pink elephants

483
00:46:28.037 --> 00:46:32.035
Pink elephants

484
00:48:52.063 --> 00:48:55.341
- Well, looky here, looky here.
- My, my.

485
00:48:55.422 --> 00:48:57.261
Why, this is most irregular.

486
00:48:57.341 --> 00:48:59.820
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.

487
00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:04.538
- They ain't dead, is they?
- No. Dead people don't snore.

488
00:49:04.618 --> 00:49:06.857
Or do they?

489
00:49:08.377 --> 00:49:10.296
Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus?
Come on.

490
00:49:10.376 --> 00:49:14.374
Step aside, brother.
Uh, what's cookin' 'round here?

491
00:49:14.455 --> 00:49:16.453
What's the good news?
What's fryin', boy?

492
00:49:16.534 --> 00:49:20.292
- Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.

493
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:29.649
- Well, hush my beak!
- Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.

494
00:49:29.728 --> 00:49:31.808
Yeah. Find out
what they're doin' up here.

495
00:49:31.888 --> 00:49:33.887
- Yeah.
- And "ax" them what they want.

496
00:49:33.967 --> 00:49:36.206
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.

497
00:49:59.397 --> 00:50:03.316
Ohh! Those pink elephants.

498
00:50:03.396 --> 00:50:06.194
Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!

499
00:50:09.874 --> 00:50:13.552
What's so funny? What are you boys
doin' down here, anyway?

500
00:50:13.632 --> 00:50:15.711
What are we doin' down here?

501
00:50:15.791 --> 00:50:17.630
Well, hear him talk.

502
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:20.589
Go on.
Fly up a tree where you belong.

503
00:50:22.429 --> 00:50:24.828
- Say, look here, Brother Rat.
- Brother Rat?

504
00:50:24.908 --> 00:50:28.026
Now listen. I ain't your brother
and I ain't no rat, see?

505
00:50:28.107 --> 00:50:30.710
Uh-huh. And I suppose you...

506
00:50:30.745 --> 00:50:34.425
and no elephant ain't
up in no tree, either.

507
00:50:34.504 --> 00:50:37.943
No! No, me and no tree
ain't up no... Huh?

508
00:50:38.023 --> 00:50:40.022
Tree?

509
00:50:42.501 --> 00:50:44.500
Yo!

510
00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.099
Dumbo.

511
00:50:48.179 --> 00:50:50.658
Dumbo. Wake up.

512
00:50:50.738 --> 00:50:53.537
Wake up, Dumbo!

513
00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:57.055
Don't look now,
but I think we're up in a tree.

514
00:51:25.045 --> 00:51:27.604
Aw, don't pay no attention
to them scarecrows.

515
00:51:27.684 --> 00:51:30.723
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.

516
00:51:30.803 --> 00:51:32.722
So long, boy!

517
00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.598
But I wonder how we ever
got up in that tree, anyway.

518
00:51:45.597 --> 00:51:47.997
Now, let's see.

519
00:51:48.076 --> 00:51:50.555
Elephants can't climb trees,
can they?

520
00:51:50.636 --> 00:51:53.034
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.

521
00:51:53.115 --> 00:51:56.073
Couldn't jump up.
Mm-mm. It's too high.

522
00:51:56.153 --> 00:51:58.632
Hey there, son.
Maybe you all flew up.

523
00:51:59.752 --> 00:52:03.511
Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we...

524
00:52:03.546 --> 00:52:06.469
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!

525
00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:09.074
Boy, am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?

526
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:12.387
Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo.
Why, they're perfect wings.

527
00:52:12.467 --> 00:52:16.946
The very things that held ya down
are gonna carry ya up and up and up!

528
00:52:16.981 --> 00:52:19.149
I can see it all now.

529
00:52:19.184 --> 00:52:21.744
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder
of the Universe!

530
00:52:21.779 --> 00:52:23.903
The world's only flyin' elephant!

531
00:52:26.861 --> 00:52:28.746
Did you ever see an elephant fly?

532
00:52:28.781 --> 00:52:32.300
- Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.

533
00:52:32.335 --> 00:52:34.459
- Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly.
- Yeah!

534
00:52:36.058 --> 00:52:38.137
See, I've seen all that too.

535
00:52:38.218 --> 00:52:41.657
I've seen a peanut stand
and heard a rubber band.

536
00:52:41.736 --> 00:52:44.815
I seen a needle
that winked its eye.

537
00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:47.894
But I be done seen
about ever'thing

538
00:52:47.973 --> 00:52:50.133
When I see a elephant fly

539
00:52:50.213 --> 00:52:53.812
- What'd you say, boy?
- I said when I see a elephant fly

540
00:52:53.891 --> 00:52:57.251
I seen a front porch swing
heard a diamond ring

541
00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.969
I seen a polka-dot railroad tie

542
00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:03.648
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing

543
00:53:03.683 --> 00:53:05.807
When I see a elephant fly

544
00:53:05.887 --> 00:53:08.686
- Da da-da-da
- Da-da-da do-do-dow wow

545
00:53:08.766 --> 00:53:11.485
- Da da-da-da
- Hey, wow

546
00:53:11.565 --> 00:53:14.124
I saw a clotheshorse
He rear up and buck

547
00:53:14.204 --> 00:53:17.322
And they tell me that a man
made a vegetable truck

548
00:53:17.403 --> 00:53:20.247
I didn't see that
I only heard

549
00:53:20.282 --> 00:53:22.841
Just to be sociable
I'll take your word

550
00:53:22.921 --> 00:53:26.040
- I heard a fireside chat
- I saw a baseball bat

551
00:53:26.075 --> 00:53:28.919
And I just laughed
till I thought I'd die

552
00:53:28.998 --> 00:53:32.517
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing

553
00:53:32.597 --> 00:53:35.555
When I see a elephant fly

554
00:53:35.636 --> 00:53:38.915
Bo Sho Ba-da-do-do

555
00:53:47.472 --> 00:53:50.751
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing

556
00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:55.068
When I see a elephant fly

557
00:53:55.149 --> 00:53:58.107
With the wind.

558
00:53:58.187 --> 00:54:02.585
When I see a elephant

559
00:54:02.666 --> 00:54:05.065
Fly

560
00:54:12.422 --> 00:54:15.701
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough.

561
00:54:20.019 --> 00:54:21.699
Quiet, gentlemen.

562
00:54:21.778 --> 00:54:24.338
The Reverend Rodent
is gonna address you.

563
00:54:24.417 --> 00:54:27.456
You ought a be ashamed
of yourselves.

564
00:54:27.536 --> 00:54:29.696
A bunch of big guys like you...

565
00:54:29.775 --> 00:54:32.975
pickin' on a poor
little orphan like him.

566
00:54:33.054 --> 00:54:37.132
Suppose you was torn away from
your mother when you was just a baby...

567
00:54:37.213 --> 00:54:39.532
nobody to tuck you in at nights...

568
00:54:39.612 --> 00:54:44.250
no warm, soft, caressin' trunk
to snuzzle into.

569
00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:46.570
How would you like to be
left out alone...

570
00:54:46.649 --> 00:54:49.928
in a cold, cruel, heartless world?

571
00:54:50.007 --> 00:54:53.127
And why? I ask ya, why?

572
00:54:53.207 --> 00:54:57.045
Just because he's got those big ears,
they call him a freak.

573
00:54:57.126 --> 00:54:59.124
The laughingstock of the circus.

574
00:54:59.204 --> 00:55:01.683
Then when his mother
tried to protect him...

575
00:55:01.764 --> 00:55:04.083
they threw her into the clink.

576
00:55:04.162 --> 00:55:07.761
And on top of that,
they made him a clown!

577
00:55:07.841 --> 00:55:10.640
Socially, he's washed up.

578
00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:14.799
Ah, but what's the use of talkin'
to you coldhearted birds?

579
00:55:14.834 --> 00:55:16.958
Go ahead. Have your fun.

580
00:55:17.037 --> 00:55:19.916
Laugh at him.
Kick him, now that he's down.

581
00:55:19.997 --> 00:55:22.395
Go on!

582
00:55:22.476 --> 00:55:24.315
We don't care.

583
00:55:31.192 --> 00:55:33.032
Come on, Dumbo.

584
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:40.468
Hey, brother,
w- w-wait a minute.

585
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:43.028
Uh, don't go away
feelin' like that.

586
00:55:43.108 --> 00:55:45.187
We done seen the light.

587
00:55:45.267 --> 00:55:47.106
You boys is okay.

588
00:55:47.186 --> 00:55:49.346
Please, you've done enough.

589
00:55:49.425 --> 00:55:53.584
Well, but we're all fixin' to help you.
Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?

590
00:55:53.664 --> 00:55:55.823
- Well, it sure is.
- Uh, yeah, that... You're right.

591
00:55:55.903 --> 00:55:58.622
You wanna make the elephant fly,
don't ya?

592
00:55:58.702 --> 00:56:02.061
Well, you gotta use a lot of' choplogic.
You know, psychology.

593
00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:05.100
Now, here's what you do.
First, you, uh...

594
00:56:05.179 --> 00:56:07.019
Uh, bu...

595
00:56:07.099 --> 00:56:09.898
And then, right after that,
you, uh...

596
00:56:12.297 --> 00:56:15.015
Use the magic feather.
Catch on?

597
00:56:15.096 --> 00:56:17.575
The magic feather?

598
00:56:17.655 --> 00:56:19.539
Yeah, I gotcha.

599
00:56:19.574 --> 00:56:23.093
Dumbo! Look! Have I got it!

600
00:56:23.173 --> 00:56:25.972
The magic feather!
Now you can fly!

601
00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:33.329
Let's go. Let's go.

602
00:56:33.409 --> 00:56:36.687
- Heave ho. Heave ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.

603
00:56:36.768 --> 00:56:39.886
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on now.

604
00:56:39.966 --> 00:56:41.806
- Up, down. Up, down.
- Heave ho.

605
00:56:41.885 --> 00:56:44.045
- One, two, One, two. One, two.
- Heave ho.

606
00:56:44.125 --> 00:56:46.284
Faster, faster.
Get up flyin' speed.

607
00:56:46.364 --> 00:56:48.763
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage.

608
00:56:48.843 --> 00:56:50.682
Take off.

609
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.559
Aw, it's no use, Dumbo.

610
00:56:59.639 --> 00:57:01.958
I guess it's just
another one of their... Look!

611
00:57:02.039 --> 00:57:04.677
Hot diggity! You're flyin'.

612
00:57:04.757 --> 00:57:06.596
You're flyin'!

613
00:57:09.075 --> 00:57:12.514
Uh, why, he flies
just like a eagle.

614
00:57:12.595 --> 00:57:14.833
That's better than a airplane.

615
00:57:14.914 --> 00:57:17.233
Brother, now I've seen everything.

616
00:57:19.232 --> 00:57:22.510
But I be done seen

617
00:57:22.591 --> 00:57:26.829
When I see a elephant fly

618
00:57:26.909 --> 00:57:28.908
With the wind.

619
00:57:28.988 --> 00:57:32.827
When I see a elephant

620
00:57:32.906 --> 00:57:35.385

621
00:57:35.466 --> 00:57:37.945
Dumbo, I knew you could do it!

622
00:57:38.024 --> 00:57:40.824
Wait'll we get to the big town.

623
00:57:40.903 --> 00:57:44.263
Boy, them city folks is

624

Look at that house.
Dumbo,

629
00:58:11.132 --> 00:58:14.011
you're standing
on the threshold of success.

630
00:58:14.091 --> 00:58:16.491
Don't look down.
It'll make you dizzy.

631
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:20.088
Boy, are they in for a surprise.
Ho-ho.

632
00:58:21.129 --> 00:58:25.047

Okay. Contact!

634
00:58:31.525 --> 00:58:33.363
Take off!

00:58:37.442 --> 00:58:39.761
Uh-oh. The magic feather!

636
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.278
Dumbo, come on. Fly.
Open them ears.

637
00:58:48.478 --> 00:58:51.277
The magic feather was just a gag.
You can fly.

00:58:51.357 --> 00:58:54.236
Honest, you can.
Hurry! Open 'em up!

Now, loop the loop.

643
00:59:53.814 --> 00:59:56.532
You're makin' history!

644

I've seen a peanut stand

645

655
01:00:52.031 --> 01:00:54.190
I wish I'd have got his autograph.

656
01:00:54.271 --> 01:00:55.950
Oh, man, I got his autograph.

657
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:58.269
Well, so long, glamour boy!
