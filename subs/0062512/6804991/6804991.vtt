00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:31.614
(gunshot)

2
00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.925
(man #1) <i>Calling Cape Cod. Cape Cod?</i>

3
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.844
<i>This is Jupiter 16.</i>

4
00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:54.887
<i>Can you give a go for fourth orbit?</i>

5
00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:56.806
(man #2) <i>Cape Cod to Jupiter 16.</i>

6
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.809
<i>Can you confirm 02 pressure
is within limit?</i>

7
00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.271
(man #1) <i>Roger. It all looks good
in the environmental control system.</i>

8
00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:06.816
(man #2) <i>OK.
Everything looks good from here.</i>

9
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.235
<i>You have a go for fourth orbit.</i>

10
00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.404
(man #1) <i>Jupiter 16. Roger.</i>

11
00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:14.741
<i>You're stowing all loose gear.
Ready for the EVA.</i>

12
00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:16.409
<i>Jupiter 16,</i> this is Cape Cod.

13
00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.327
Start your EVA when you're ready.

14
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:21.080
You have time in the other EVAs
for experiments.

15
00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:23.499
<i>So don't stay out too long, Chris.</i>

16
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:24.709
(Chris) <i>OK, flight.</i>

17
00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:27.962
<i>- Don't worry. We'll stick to plan.</i>
- Roger.

18
00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:32.592
<i>Cape Cod to Jupiter 16. On my mark
it will be four plus three seven.</i>

19
00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:35.678
<i>Four, three, two,</i>

20
00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:38.014
<i>one, mark.</i>

21
00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.648
<i>Cape Cod, this is Chris.</i>

22
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:48.858
<i>I'm out.</i>

23
00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:51.277
<i>Everything looks OK.</i>

24
00:01:51.487 --> 00:01:52.570
(man #2) <i>Good.</i>

25
00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.697
(Chris) <i>The manoeuvring unit
works this time.</i>

26
00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:57.366
<i>I used it to get out.
It makes things a lot easier.</i>

27
00:01:57.993 --> 00:02:00.995
Cape Cod to Hawaii,
this is flight control, come in.

28
00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:02.538
<i>Hawaii, roger.</i>

29
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:06.375
<i>Hawaii, we expect to start EVA
over your station on this pass.</i>

30
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.127
<i>Hawaii to Jupiter 16.</i>

31
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:11.881
An unidentified object is closing on you
fast from astern.

32
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.341
<i>Can you see it?</i>

33
00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:17.762
Hawaii, we have nothing here.
Hold while we check the space track.

34
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.473
Hawaii to <i>Jupiter 16.</i>

35
00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:24.101
<i>Repeat, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.</i>

36
00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:26.395
<i>An unidentified object is on our scope.</i>

37
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.606
<i>We see nothing.</i>

38
00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:31.734
<i>Can you give me a bearing?</i>

39
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.486
Appears to be coming up fast

40
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.112
<i>from astern.</i>

41
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.573
<i>Hey, now I see it.</i>

42
00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:41.077
<i>It's another spacecraft!</i>

43
00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:43.162
<i>Repeat, it's another spacecraft!</i>

44
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.040
(crackles)
<i>Does it looks like a close pass?</i>

45
00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.000
<i>You're breaking up. Say again.</i>

46
00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:51.170
<i>- Does it look like a close pass?
- Chris, what's happening?</i>

47
00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:54.632
<i>It's coming right at us.
The front is opening up!</i>

48
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.635
<i>I repeat, the front is opening up!</i>

49
00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:02.849
<i>- It's coming right at us.
- Chris, get back in, get back in!</i>

50
00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:05.935
<i>Do you read me? You're breaking up.</i>

51
00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.770
<i>- Repeat, you're breaking up.
- What's happening?</i>

52
00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:11.148
<i>Hawaii to Jupiter 16.</i>

53
00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:13.776
<i>Hawaii to Jupiter 16. Are you receiving?</i>

54
00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:16.779
<i>You're breaking up. Come in, please.
Jupiter 16!</i>

55
00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:18.573
<i>You're breaking up...</i>

56
00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:20.658
(distorted voices)

57
00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.124
(Chris) <i>My lead line! It's cu...</i>

58
00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.379
<i>Hawaii to Jupiter 16, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.</i>

59
00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:36.549
Are you receiving me?
Come in, please. Over.

60
00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:37.800
Hello, Houston.

61
00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:41.262
We've lost radio contact.
We've also lost him on the scope.

62
00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.890
<i>Unidentified object is still orbiting.</i>

63
00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:46.267
<i>Alert all stations and track him closely.</i>

64
00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.739
It is ridiculous for the Soviet government
to deny responsibility.

65
00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:03.117
The Soviet government denies
all knowledge of this affair.

66
00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.995
The world knows
we are a peace-loving people.

67
00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.915
I hereby give notice that in 20 days

68
00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.209
the United States
will launch her next spaceship.

69
00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:14.754
My government has instructed me
to inform you

70
00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:19.091
that any interference with it
will be regarded as an act of war.

71
00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.843
May I ask what motive

72
00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:23.262
our Russian friends would have

73
00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:25.640
for wishing to destroy
American spacecraft?

74
00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:29.185
My government sees this
as a blatant attempt

75
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:33.773
to gain complete and absolute control
of space itself for military purposes.

76
00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:35.524
We don't agree.

77
00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:38.611
Her Majesty's Government
is not convinced

78
00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.948
that this intruder missile
originated from Soviet Russia.

79
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.158
Our tracking station in Singapore

80
00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:48.454
reported faint echoes of this craft
coming down in the Sea of Japan area.

81
00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:51.832
Might I suggest
that this is where you should

82
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.085
concentrate your intelligence forces?

83
00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.506
The prime minister asked me to assure
you this is what we propose to do.

84
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.759
As a matter of fact, our man in Hong Kong
is working on it now.

85
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.688
Why do Chinese girls taste different
from all other girls?

86
00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:15.773
You think we better, huh?

87
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.817
No, just different.

88
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.735
Like Peking duck is different from

89
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.988
Russian caviar, but I love 'em both.

90
00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:24.323
Darling, I give you very best duck.

91
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.575
That would be lovely.

92
00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:30.579
We've had some interesting times
together, Ling. I'll be sorry to go.

93
00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.250
(knocking at door)

94
00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:41.465
(siren)

95
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.271
Take that door.

96
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.356
The bed!

97
00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:07.950
- We're too late.
- Well, at least he died on the job.

98
00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.327
He'd have wanted it this way.

99
00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:40.983
<i>You only live twice</i>

100
00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:46.489
<i>Or so it seems</i>

101
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.242
<i>One life for yourself</i>

102
00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:57.374
<i>And one for your dreams</i>

103
00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:02.755
<i>You drift through the years</i>

104
00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:09.095
<i>And life seems tame</i>

105
00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:11.931
<i>Till one dream appears</i>

106
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:17.603
<i>And love is its name</i>

107
00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:24.193
<i>And love is a stranger</i>

108
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:30.449
<i>Who'll beckon you on</i>

109
00:07:30.534 --> 00:07:34.370
<i>Don't think of the danger</i>

110
00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:39.875
<i>Or the stranger is gone</i>

111
00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:45.381
<i>This dream is for you</i>

112
00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:50.719
<i>So pay the price</i>

113
00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:54.431
<i>Make one dream come true</i>

114
00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:59.603
<i>You only live twice</i>

115
00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:06.318
<i>And love is a stranger</i>

116
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.407
<i>Who'll beckon you on</i>

117
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:16.162
<i>Don't think of the danger</i>

118
00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:21.876
<i>Or the stranger is gone</i>

119
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.131
<i>This dream is for you</i>

120
00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:32.178
<i>So pay the price</i>

121
00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:36.015
<i>Make one dream come true</i>

122
00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:42.104
<i>You only live twice</i>

123
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:53.782
(ship horns)

124
00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:23.145
We shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed

125
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.106
in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye,

126
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.942
at the last trump.

127
00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:31.528
For the trumpet shall sound and
the dead shall be raised incorruptible,

128
00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:33.614
and we shall all be changed.

129
00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:37.576
We therefore commit his body to the deep
to be turned into corruption,

130
00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:42.081
looking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead.

131
00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.833
Present!

132
00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:54.176
- Fire!
- (gunshot)

133
00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.666
- Carry on.
- Aye aye, sir.

134
00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:29.229
Permission to come aboard?

135
00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:31.482
- Permission granted.
- Thank you.

136
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.278
- Take this officer aft.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.828
<i>Number One, take her up to 90ft.
Course zero four five.</i>

138
00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.914
Aye aye, sir.

139
00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:55.130
- Hello, Penny.
- You'd better go right in.

140
00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.841
You're late as usual,
even from your own funeral.

141
00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.885
We corpses have no sense of timing.

142
00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.512
(buzzer)

143
00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:03.764
In you go... sir.

144
00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.849
Thank you... ma'am.

145
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:19.279
- Oh, sit down, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

146
00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:22.491
- No ill effects?
- None at all, sir.

147
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:27.579
Now you're dead, perhaps some of your
old friends will pay less attention to you.

148
00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:31.750
Give you more elbow room.
You'll need it, too.

149
00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:36.296
This is the big one, 007. That's why
I'm out here. You're fully briefed?

150
00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:39.383
Yes, but there's one thing
I don't understand.

151
00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:41.593
If our Singapore tracking
station is correct

152
00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:45.055
about the rocket not landing
in Russia, where did it land?

153
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.101
We assume it's Japan.
All this is guesswork,

154
00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.270
but the PM wants us to
play it with everything we've got.

155
00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:55.190
- And the aerial reconnaissance?
- All photographed. Nothing.

156
00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:58.068
Are the Japanese equipped
to launch such a rocket?

157
00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:00.446
- We don't think so.
- Then who else is?

158
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.531
That's what you've got to
find out, and fast.

159
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.491
Before the real shooting starts.

160
00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:07.870
This damn thing could blow up
into a full-scale war.

161
00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:12.708
When you get to Tokyo,
go to that name and address.

162
00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.544
Our man Henderson
will contact you there.

163
00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.297
- Henderson.
<i>- Captain here. Full ahead.</i>

164
00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:20.132
Right.

165
00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:25.053
- Well, that's all.
- Thank you, sir.

166
00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:26.555
- 007.
- Sir?

167
00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:29.641
We've only three weeks
to the next American launch.

168
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.143
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.

169
00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:35.063
My sources tell me the Russians
are planning one even earlier.

170
00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:38.233
- So move fast, 007.
- Yes, sir.

171
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:41.570
(typing)

172
00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.409
Oh, by the way, how was the girl?

173
00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:49.953
Which girl?

174
00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.706
Er, the Chinese one we fixed you up with.

175
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.000
Another five minutes, I'd have found out.

176
00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:57.669
Hmm, she'll never know what she missed.

177
00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:58.754
(buzzer)

178
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:02.007
Miss Moneypenny,
give 007 the password we've agreed

179
00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:03.926
<i>- with Japanese SIS.</i>
- Yes, sir.

180
00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:08.347
We tried to think of something
you wouldn't forget.

181
00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.473
Yes?

182
00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.935
I... love... you.

183
00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:15.812
Repeat it, please,
to make sure you get it.

184
00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.773
Don't worry, I get it.

185
00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:19.525
<i>Sayonara.</i>

186
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.443
James... good luck.

187
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.697
<i>Instant Japanese.</i> You may need it.

188
00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:30.619
You forget, I took a first
in oriental languages at Cambridge.

189
00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:34.665
(alarm blares)

190
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.126
(PA) <i>Stand by to load.</i>

191
00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.797
<i>Lift to the launch!</i>

192
00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:48.262
<i>Tube loaded.</i>

193
00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:49.805
<i>Hubcap open.</i>

194
00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:54.977
<i>Fire.</i>

195
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.416
(insects chirrup)

196
00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:01.752
(speaks Japanese)

197
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:18.977
(Japanese)

198
00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:43.293
This is your ticket.

199
00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.840
Thank you.

200
00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:50.759
<i>Dozo.</i>

201
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.638
(instructions shouted in Japanese)

202
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.482
I love you.

203
00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.777
I have a car nearby.

204
00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:35.155
- Oh, where do you suggest we go?
- I know a quiet hotel.

205
00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:41.244
- And?
- Where your friend is waiting.

206
00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:44.873
Mr Henderson.

207
00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:51.463
Wasn't Mr Henderson
able to come himself?

208
00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.174
- I suppose not.
- Why?

209
00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.176
He didn't say.

210
00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:14.069
Well, I think it's about hotel-time.

211
00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:42.848
How long have you
worked for Henderson?

212
00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:46.893
Long enough to learn not to discuss
such matters with strangers.

213
00:19:57.196 --> 00:20:00.699
(Japanese)

214
00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:10.542
- Mr Henderson's waiting for you.
- You're not coming in with me?

215
00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:13.336
Mr Henderson would like
to see you alone.

216
00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.098
Do come in.

217
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.643
Mr Henderson?

218
00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.563
At your service.

219
00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:51.041
I believe, um... you wanted to
ask me some questions.

220
00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:53.501
Yes. Excuse me.

221
00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:56.504
(dull thwack)

222
00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:01.343
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you got it right.

223
00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:04.554
I lost that in Singapore in '42.

224
00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:09.017
You must excuse
this rather odd mixture of styles,

225
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.811
but I refuse to go entirely Japanese.

226
00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:14.773
Very fond of some of these old things.

227
00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:19.653
- You've never been to Japan before?
- No, never.

228
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:22.781
I myself have lived here for, er...

229
00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:25.617
...28 years.

230
00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:27.827
And I'm just beginning
to know my way about.

231
00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:31.873
- Your most vital contact will be Tanaka.
- Tanaka?

232
00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:34.668
He's head of the Japanese secret service.

233
00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:38.922
And his identity is the most
closely guarded secret in Japan.

234
00:21:39.048 --> 00:21:40.799
When can I see him?

235
00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:44.552
- You can see Tiger tonight.
- Tiger?

236
00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:48.348
His closest friends
are permitted to call him that.

237
00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:51.184
- Do you have any leads of your own?
- Yes, I do.

238
00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:54.270
Oh, that's stirred not shaken.
That was right?

239
00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:56.106
Perfect.

240
00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:57.941
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

241
00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:01.653
Russian vodka. Well done.

242
00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:05.198
Yes, I get it from the doorman
at the Russian embassy.

243
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.993
(softly) Amongst certain other things.

244
00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:11.579
Now, look. I think London's theory

245
00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:14.499
about the missile being fired
from this country is right.

246
00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:16.459
I don't know how or where.

247
00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:19.254
And don't ask me who's doing it either.

248
00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:26.011
But I have a fairly shrewd idea
that a major foreign power is behind it all.

249
00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:27.887
You mean, apart from Russia and Japan?

250
00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:30.765
Oh, it's not Russia, old boy,
I'm sure of that.

251
00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:33.810
It's not Japan either.

252
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.189
Although a large Japanese
industrial concern is...

253
00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:57.584
(groans)

254
00:23:07.011 --> 00:23:08.470
(engine guns)

255
00:23:40.461 --> 00:23:41.669
(moans)

256
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.185
- (Japanese)
- (groans)

257
00:24:38.853 --> 00:24:40.520
Good evening.

258
00:26:06.857 --> 00:26:08.066
Cheers.

259
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:14.656
Siamese vodka?

260
00:26:51.277 --> 00:26:52.652
(footsteps)

261
00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.369
(footsteps approach)

262
00:27:28.397 --> 00:27:29.564
(alarm)

263
00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:41.284
(shouting in Japanese)

264
00:27:50.044 --> 00:27:51.502
There he is!

265
00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:54.630
Freeze!

266
00:27:58.469 --> 00:28:00.345
(shouting in Japanese)

267
00:28:06.894 --> 00:28:08.269
(gunshots)

268
00:28:11.273 --> 00:28:12.774
Get in, quick!

269
00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:22.617
Now, what the hell's the score?

270
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:25.453
What do you mean?
My job is to help you.

271
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:27.330
Like you helped Henderson?

272
00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:29.791
I'm taking you to a place of safety.

273
00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:33.169
No, this time I'm taking you.
I want some information now.

274
00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:37.256
- I have no information to give you.
- We'll see about that. Slow down.

275
00:29:29.977 --> 00:29:31.185
Welcome.

276
00:29:31.353 --> 00:29:32.562
(laughs)

277
00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:37.024
Welcome to Japan, Mr Bond.

278
00:29:38.527 --> 00:29:41.446
It is a great pleasure to meet you at last.

279
00:29:42.489 --> 00:29:45.199
And how do you like our country so far?

280
00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:52.540
I am a trifle disappointed at the ease
with which I could pull you in.

281
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:56.627
The one thing my honourable mother
taught me long ago

282
00:29:56.712 --> 00:29:59.630
was never to get into a car
with a strange girl.

283
00:29:59.715 --> 00:30:03.384
But you, I'm afraid,
will get into anything with any girl!

284
00:30:08.182 --> 00:30:11.976
I must say, you have a lot of energy
for a dead man, Mr Bond.

285
00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:20.109
You are James Bond, aren't you?

286
00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:27.325
I am so very pleased to meet you,
<i>Bond-san.</i> I really am.

287
00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:30.495
Permit me to introduce myself.

288
00:30:30.579 --> 00:30:33.331
My name is Tanaka. Please call me Tiger.

289
00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:36.918
If you're Tanaka,
how do you feel about me?

290
00:30:38.378 --> 00:30:40.046
I... love you.

291
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:43.633
I'm glad we got that out of the way.

292
00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:45.927
I'd like you to examine these
as soon as possible.

293
00:30:46.762 --> 00:30:48.804
They're from Osato's safe.

294
00:30:52.059 --> 00:30:54.477
This is an order for naval stores.

295
00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:57.688
500 kilos of butter, 50 containers of lox.

296
00:30:58.941 --> 00:31:00.024
What is lox?

297
00:31:00.108 --> 00:31:02.610
An American name for smoked salmon.

298
00:31:05.197 --> 00:31:08.282
But it's also the technical name
for liquid oxygen.

299
00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:09.534
Which makes rocket fuel.

300
00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:11.327
- Very interesting.
- Yes.

301
00:31:11.453 --> 00:31:12.787
We must go.

302
00:31:13.372 --> 00:31:16.457
The journey out will be more dignified
than the journey in.

303
00:31:16.542 --> 00:31:18.626
That wouldn't be difficult.

304
00:31:18.794 --> 00:31:21.212
Oh, I'd like that negative enlarged.

305
00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:22.338
OK.

306
00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:26.717
(Japanese)

307
00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:30.721
My private train.

308
00:31:30.806 --> 00:31:33.266
I never travel in the streets of Tokyo.

309
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.519
In my position, it would be most unwise.

310
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.774
Very convenient.

311
00:31:41.858 --> 00:31:45.736
I imagine that your Mr M in London
has a similar arrangement.

312
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:47.822
M? Oh yes, but of course.

313
00:31:48.824 --> 00:31:50.950
Then the girl in the white
sports car's one of us.

314
00:31:51.034 --> 00:31:53.494
- Aki? Yes.
- Very competent.

315
00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:55.162
<i>- Domo arigato.
- Dozo.</i>

316
00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:58.791
Do you like Japanese sake,
or would you prefer vodka martini?

317
00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:00.668
Oh, no. I like sake.

318
00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:05.881
Especially when it's served
at the correct temperature.

319
00:32:05.966 --> 00:32:08.259
98.4° Fahrenheit, like this is.

320
00:32:08.343 --> 00:32:11.095
For a European,
you are exceptionally cultivated.

321
00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:12.513
(Japanese)

322
00:32:13.807 --> 00:32:16.392
- We'll see the photograph you found.
- Good.

323
00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:25.776
A ship and a strip of land.
It could be anywhere.

324
00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:27.945
My men found a microdot on the paper.

325
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.280
Enlarge!

326
00:32:30.574 --> 00:32:35.202
It says, 'Photograph taken by female
American tourist from coastal vessel.'

327
00:32:35.704 --> 00:32:38.497
'The woman has been liquidated
as a routine precaution.'

328
00:32:39.207 --> 00:32:42.043
- Can we see the photograph again?
- Of course.

329
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.713
(Bond) So, they killed an innocent tourist
for taking this?

330
00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:48.257
Can you make it bigger?

331
00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:50.051
(Bond) <i>Ning-Po.</i>

332
00:32:50.385 --> 00:32:52.970
Check motor vessel <i>Ning-Po</i>. Full details.

333
00:32:53.055 --> 00:32:55.097
All recent movements
and present whereabouts.

334
00:32:57.726 --> 00:33:00.728
- What's that on the left?
- Focus on the left!

335
00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.606
Aha! <i>Ama.</i> Diving girls.

336
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.483
Can you identify that coastline?

337
00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:07.193
Given time, yes.

338
00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:16.744
- Who is the head of Osato Chemicals?
- Mr Osato.

339
00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:18.954
Can you arrange an appointment
with him tomorrow?

340
00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:20.331
Of course.

341
00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:23.000
But tonight, consider my house yours.

342
00:33:23.085 --> 00:33:25.419
Including all of my possessions,
naturally.

343
00:33:27.089 --> 00:33:28.631
(running water)

344
00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:37.765
My friend, now you take
your first civilised bath.

345
00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:40.267
Really? Well, I like the plumbing.

346
00:33:40.811 --> 00:33:44.105
Place yourself entirely in their hands,
my dear <i>Bond-san.</i>

347
00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:47.775
Rule number one,
is never do anything for yourself

348
00:33:48.235 --> 00:33:50.069
when someone else can do it for you.

349
00:33:50.153 --> 00:33:52.446
- And number two?
- Rule number two,

350
00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:56.283
in Japan, men always come first.
Women come second.

351
00:33:56.702 --> 00:33:58.828
I might just retire to here.

352
00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:07.920
Your English girls would never perform
this simple service.

353
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.881
I know one or two
who might get round to it.

354
00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:13.300
Miss Moneypenny, perhaps? (chuckles)

355
00:34:13.385 --> 00:34:15.803
We have our sources,
<i>Bond-san,</i> just like you.

356
00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.765
Don't get the soap in my eye, will you?

357
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.183
(Japanese)

358
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:29.400
I suppose you know what it is about you
that fascinates them.

359
00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:33.988
It's the hair on your chest.
Japanese men have beautiful bare skin.

360
00:34:34.322 --> 00:34:36.282
Japanese proverb say,

361
00:34:36.992 --> 00:34:39.952
'Bird never make nest in bare tree.'

362
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.084
If Henderson's theory is right,

363
00:34:47.169 --> 00:34:50.796
why would a foreign power
want to launch missiles from Japan?

364
00:34:50.881 --> 00:34:54.091
Because if they were discovered,
they could deny responsibility.

365
00:34:54.176 --> 00:34:57.762
Especially if some private organisation's
doing the work.

366
00:34:57.846 --> 00:34:59.680
- Osato?
- Perhaps.

367
00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:03.476
Mr Osato is one of
our greatest industrialists.

368
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.519
No, he's merely a front.

369
00:35:05.604 --> 00:35:07.354
- Who is big enough?
- SPECTRE.

370
00:35:07.689 --> 00:35:08.981
Could be.

371
00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:12.026
Now, massage. Which girl do you select?

372
00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:20.075
I'll settle for this little old lady here.

373
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.535
Good choice.

374
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.370
She's very sexyful.

375
00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:34.715
The last time someone gave me
a massage was in Hong Kong.

376
00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:40.262
But unfortunately...
we had to cut it short.

377
00:35:40.639 --> 00:35:43.808
We were rudely interrupted
by a couple of gunmen.

378
00:35:44.643 --> 00:35:47.394
So, we never got around to finishing it.

379
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.273
This time, you shall finish it.

380
00:35:54.236 --> 00:35:55.319
Aki.

381
00:36:02.536 --> 00:36:04.870
No one will disturb you tonight.

382
00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:12.837
I think I will enjoy very much
serving under you.

383
00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:38.070
(lift bell pings)

384
00:36:39.155 --> 00:36:40.739
- Mr Fisher?
- Yes.

385
00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:42.575
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

386
00:36:50.417 --> 00:36:52.209
Please come in, Mr Fisher.

387
00:36:52.294 --> 00:36:54.420
- Mr Osato is expecting you.
- Thank you.

388
00:36:54.963 --> 00:36:57.214
You are three and a half minutes early.

389
00:36:57.299 --> 00:36:58.924
Please be seated.

390
00:37:22.449 --> 00:37:23.908
(keys rattle)

391
00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:01.320
(helicopter approaches)

392
00:38:25.553 --> 00:38:28.055
- How do you do, Mr Fisher?
- How do you do?

393
00:38:28.682 --> 00:38:31.308
Miss Grant, my confidential secretary.

394
00:38:31.643 --> 00:38:33.143
- Hello.
- Hello.

395
00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:37.231
- May we offer you some champagne?
- No, thank you, it's too early for me.

396
00:38:37.899 --> 00:38:39.400
- You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.

397
00:38:40.193 --> 00:38:42.152
(Osato) I always take
a glass in the morning.

398
00:38:42.237 --> 00:38:44.989
- You should try it.
- It's bad for your liver.

399
00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:49.076
- Nonsense, it adds a sparkle to the day.
- I'm sure it does.

400
00:38:56.001 --> 00:38:58.252
A Dom Pérignon '59, Mr Fisher.

401
00:38:58.962 --> 00:39:02.840
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- Well, if you insist.

402
00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:05.926
- Please be seated, Mr Fisher.
- Thank you.

403
00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:07.720
(cork pops)

404
00:39:11.433 --> 00:39:13.600
So, you are the new managing director

405
00:39:13.685 --> 00:39:15.644
- of Empire Chemicals?
- Yes.

406
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.980
- What happened to Williamson?
- Williamson?

407
00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.816
Ah, yes, he died rather suddenly,
poor chap.

408
00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:22.943
Ah, so. From what?

409
00:39:23.445 --> 00:39:25.529
He fell into a pulveriser at the works.

410
00:39:25.613 --> 00:39:26.822
Ah, so.

411
00:39:27.574 --> 00:39:29.033
How shocking.

412
00:39:30.535 --> 00:39:33.704
- A very honourable death, all the same.
- (Bond) Very.

413
00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:36.123
He gained great face with the company.

414
00:39:37.292 --> 00:39:40.836
I hope you are not taking
any risks yourself, Mr Fisher.

415
00:39:41.463 --> 00:39:43.589
Me? I never take any risks.

416
00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:46.717
You forgive me for saying so, but, er

417
00:39:47.635 --> 00:39:49.970
I think you are taking one now.

418
00:39:50.472 --> 00:39:51.472
I am?

419
00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:53.682
Mm-hm. You should give up smoking.

420
00:39:54.184 --> 00:39:55.684
Cigarettes are very bad for your chest.

421
00:39:56.436 --> 00:39:59.021
Mr Osato believes in a healthy chest.

422
00:39:59.606 --> 00:40:00.814
Really?

423
00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:04.234
Now then, you must tell me
what I can do for you.

424
00:40:04.319 --> 00:40:07.446
We're interested in the bulk-buying
of fermentation chemicals.

425
00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:11.241
Monosodium glutamate
and ascorbic acid.

426
00:40:11.326 --> 00:40:14.411
- Would you like a manufacturing licence?
- Yes, very much.

427
00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:18.665
So, I'll have my sales manager
get the quotations

428
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.835
and delivery dates for you
as soon as possible.

429
00:40:21.961 --> 00:40:24.838
We'll contact you later today
at your hotel.

430
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.258
- Which hotel are you staying at?
- The Hilton.

431
00:40:30.303 --> 00:40:31.970
Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

432
00:40:32.055 --> 00:40:34.056
- A pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure to meet you, too.

433
00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:39.770
- Goodbye, Miss Brandt.
- Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

434
00:40:43.274 --> 00:40:44.525
Kill him.

435
00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:03.127
Get down!

436
00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:14.221
(rapid gunfire)

437
00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:15.556
(horn)

438
00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:22.437
(rapid gunfire)

439
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.505
294 here. Tiger, immediate.

440
00:41:49.132 --> 00:41:50.591
<i>Come in, 294.</i>

441
00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:55.846
Zero-zero is with me. We are being
chased by gunmen, in black sedan.

442
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.890
I'm heading south for Highway Two.

443
00:41:57.974 --> 00:42:00.309
Arrange usual reception, please.

444
00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:12.613
(gunshot)

445
00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:24.958
(gunshots)

446
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:38.782
<i>- How's that for Japanese efficiency?</i>
- Just a drop in the ocean.

447
00:43:41.869 --> 00:43:43.787
<i>- Zero-zero?</i>
- Yes, Tiger.

448
00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:47.124
Ning-Po <i>is owned by Osato Chemicals.</i>

449
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:50.836
- That fits. Go on.
<i>- Vessel now loading in Kobe docks.</i>

450
00:43:51.045 --> 00:43:54.047
<i>Sailing for Shanghai
at 5pm this afternoon.</i>

451
00:43:54.924 --> 00:43:58.552
<i>Suggest you proceed Kobe immediately
to look her over.</i>

452
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.388
- Can we make it?
- Yes, just.

453
00:44:01.723 --> 00:44:03.849
Proceeding immediately, Kobe docks.

454
00:44:03.933 --> 00:44:05.559
Tiger, contact M.

455
00:44:06.686 --> 00:44:08.603
Tell him to send Little Nellie.

456
00:44:08.688 --> 00:44:10.564
Repeat, Little Nellie.

457
00:44:11.316 --> 00:44:13.984
Suggest she be accompanied
by her father.

458
00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:15.652
Most urgent. Understood?

459
00:44:15.737 --> 00:44:17.070
<i>Understood.</i>

460
00:44:43.765 --> 00:44:46.391
Condensation, ice-cold. Liquid oxygen.

461
00:45:06.371 --> 00:45:08.372
(shouting in Japanese)

462
00:45:15.338 --> 00:45:16.546
Aaargh!

463
00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:19.883
Get out of here. Contact Tanaka.

464
00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:21.718
I'm not leaving you.

465
00:45:21.803 --> 00:45:24.679
- Tell him to keep that ship shadowed.
- (shouting)

466
00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:26.765
Go now.

467
00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:48.245
(shouting)

468
00:46:56.481 --> 00:46:58.356
Take him to Number 11.

469
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:03.653
- Wake him up.
- (Bond) Are you finished?

470
00:47:05.573 --> 00:47:06.907
Where am I?

471
00:47:07.283 --> 00:47:09.659
You're in my cabin on the <i>Ning-Po.</i>

472
00:47:09.744 --> 00:47:13.205
Leave him to me now. Wait in there.
And shut the door.

473
00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:15.749
I've got you now.

474
00:47:16.792 --> 00:47:18.752
Well, enjoy yourself.

475
00:47:19.879 --> 00:47:23.465
- Who are you working for?
- Empire Chemicals, you know that.

476
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:27.093
- Do all their people carry guns?
- When they're abroad, yes.

477
00:47:27.178 --> 00:47:30.013
And why were you
snooping around the docks?

478
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.391
I like ships. And I used to be a sailor.

479
00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:35.560
You are a liar.

480
00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:44.611
- Do you know what this is?
- I'd rather not.

481
00:47:44.737 --> 00:47:47.322
Plastic surgeons call it a dermatome.

482
00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:50.283
They use it to slice off skin.

483
00:47:53.538 --> 00:47:56.081
I hope you won't force me to use it.

484
00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:07.884
Now, what's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

485
00:48:18.479 --> 00:48:20.272
I have a confession to make.

486
00:48:20.606 --> 00:48:21.690
What?

487
00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:24.693
Actually, I'm a spy.

488
00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:26.695
I know that.

489
00:48:32.618 --> 00:48:35.579
I suppose you know that
industrial secrets are big business?

490
00:48:35.663 --> 00:48:36.830
Mm-hm.

491
00:48:37.665 --> 00:48:42.294
Well, I've stolen Osato's new process
for making monosodium glutamate.

492
00:48:43.296 --> 00:48:44.629
And, er...

493
00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:46.464
Well, it's worth

494
00:48:46.799 --> 00:48:48.633
$300,000.

495
00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:50.343
So?

496
00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:55.056
Well, I'll split it with you if you'll get me
out of here and back to Tokyo.

497
00:48:55.516 --> 00:48:57.267
That's a nice offer.

498
00:48:57.977 --> 00:49:01.313
- How about it?
- I'm afraid not.

499
00:49:01.731 --> 00:49:02.814
Why?

500
00:49:08.571 --> 00:49:10.363
Osato would kill me.

501
00:49:14.702 --> 00:49:17.537
We could fly to Europe tomorrow,
you and I.

502
00:49:30.051 --> 00:49:31.176
Er...

503
00:49:43.064 --> 00:49:45.398
Oh, the things I do for England.

504
00:49:56.077 --> 00:49:59.871
Now, you are going to need some
very close... protection tonight in Tokyo

505
00:49:59.955 --> 00:50:03.875
because... well, that's when
they'll try and get at you.

506
00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:05.919
You'll need the best man we've got.

507
00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:08.254
And, er... who do you suggest?

508
00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:10.215
Well,

509
00:50:10.299 --> 00:50:11.424
me.

510
00:50:11.759 --> 00:50:14.594
I'm afraid I have another appointment
tonight, Mr Fisher.

511
00:50:16.972 --> 00:50:19.933
I'm awfully sorry to leave you,
but I have to get off.

512
00:51:17.867 --> 00:51:21.453
Chasing girls will be the end of you,
<i>Bond-san,</i> I have told you before.

513
00:51:21.537 --> 00:51:24.539
He didn't chase her.
He did it so I could get away.

514
00:51:24.623 --> 00:51:27.208
He wouldn't touch that horrible girl.

515
00:51:27.334 --> 00:51:29.669
- Would you?
- Oh, heaven forbid.

516
00:51:29.962 --> 00:51:30.962
Any progress?

517
00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:34.007
Yes. We identified
the coastline in the photograph.

518
00:51:34.258 --> 00:51:39.095
It is an island called Matsu, on the direct
route between Kobe and Shanghai.

519
00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.765
We shadowed the <i>Ning-Po</i> in a helicopter.

520
00:51:41.849 --> 00:51:43.224
- Did it stop at the island?
- I think so.

521
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:46.936
It was a very dark night.
Impossible to see her all the time.

522
00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:49.481
But we know she stopped somewhere.
Look at these.

523
00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:52.942
That one we took last night.

524
00:51:54.195 --> 00:51:56.571
And that one, early this morning.

525
00:51:57.782 --> 00:52:00.742
- (Aki) Notice, please, the water line.
- You're right.

526
00:52:01.535 --> 00:52:03.870
Fully laden here and empty here.

527
00:52:05.372 --> 00:52:07.415
I want to take a fast look
at the island now.

528
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.960
- Has Little Nellie arrived yet?
- Yes, and her father.

529
00:52:12.296 --> 00:52:15.465
Ah, welcome to Japan, Dad.
Is my little girl hot and ready?

530
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:19.511
Look, 007, I've had a long and tiring
journey, probably to no purpose.

531
00:52:19.595 --> 00:52:22.305
I'm in no mood for your juvenile quips.

532
00:52:40.241 --> 00:52:42.158
I have much curiosity, <i>Bond-san.</i>

533
00:52:42.243 --> 00:52:43.827
What is Little Nellie?

534
00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:47.580
(Bond) Oh, she's a wonderful girl.
Very small, quite fast.

535
00:52:48.082 --> 00:52:50.416
Can do anything. Just your type.

536
00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:52.669
(Tanaka) A toy helicopter?

537
00:52:52.753 --> 00:52:55.588
No, it's certainly not a toy! You'll see.

538
00:52:56.257 --> 00:52:58.466
We've made some improvements
since you used her last.

539
00:52:58.759 --> 00:53:02.428
- I'll give you the drill.
- This is only for children. Don't use it!

540
00:53:02.513 --> 00:53:04.597
Take my helicopter instead.

541
00:53:06.225 --> 00:53:08.059
Right. Now pay attention.

542
00:53:08.143 --> 00:53:11.104
- Two machine guns, fixed.
- Synchronised to what?

543
00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:14.065
100 yards, using incendiaries
and high explosives.

544
00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:16.025
Two rocket launchers,

545
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.945
- forward-firing on either side.
- Fine.

546
00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:23.533
Now, these fire heat-seeking
air-to-air missiles. 60 a minute.

547
00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:24.701
Good.

548
00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:27.662
Flame guns. Two of 'em. Firing astern.

549
00:53:27.788 --> 00:53:31.249
- What range?
- 80 yards. Two smoke ejectors next door.

550
00:53:32.918 --> 00:53:35.128
Aerial mines. Now remember,

551
00:53:35.337 --> 00:53:37.964
use them only
when directly above target.

552
00:53:38.048 --> 00:53:41.217
- That's about the lot. You know the rest.
- Yes.

553
00:53:42.428 --> 00:53:43.803
Cine camera.

554
00:53:44.346 --> 00:53:48.266
- Tanaka, listen in on 410 megacycles.
- (Tanaka) Good luck!

555
00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:50.059
I'll contact you when I get over the island.

556
00:53:50.144 --> 00:53:51.978
Be careful, <i>Bond-san!</i>

557
00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:54.791
Hello, Base One.

558
00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:58.878
I'm over the island and the fishing village.
Nothing to report.

559
00:54:59.171 --> 00:55:01.506
(Tanaka) <i>We'll keep listening.</i>

560
00:55:29.451 --> 00:55:32.745
Hello, Base One.
There's nothing here but volcanoes.

561
00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:34.622
<i>Understood. Carry on.</i>

562
00:55:53.017 --> 00:56:05.361
(rapid fire)

563
00:56:28.343 --> 00:56:30.136
(helicopter plummets)

564
00:56:40.898 --> 00:57:20.144
(gunfire)

565
00:58:32.885 --> 00:58:34.343
- Hello, Base One.
<i>- Listening.</i>

566
00:58:34.428 --> 00:58:35.970
Little Nellie got a hot reception.

567
00:58:36.054 --> 00:58:38.890
Four big-shots made
improper advances,

568
00:58:38.974 --> 00:58:41.684
but she defended her honour
with great success.

569
00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:44.395
- Heading for home.
<i>- Do not come home.</i>

570
00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:46.856
<i>Russian space shot imminent.</i>

571
00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.817
<i>Proceed vector 4-6 degrees
and await instructions.</i>

572
00:58:49.902 --> 00:58:51.569
<i>- Understood?</i>
- Roger and out.

573
00:58:58.952 --> 00:59:00.119
<i>Tri,</i>

574
00:59:00.537 --> 00:59:01.787
<i>dva,</i>

575
00:59:01.872 --> 00:59:03.915
<i>edin. Shiganya!</i>

576
00:59:33.487 --> 00:59:35.279
(speaks Russian)

577
01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:53.399
(voice crackles and fades)

578
01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.402
(silence)

579
01:00:58.447 --> 01:00:59.739
(Russian)

580
01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:10.476
(PA) <i>Clear the area. Clear the area.</i>

581
01:02:12.104 --> 01:02:14.355
(announcements in Japanese)

582
01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.234
(siren)

583
01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:25.866
<i>Prepare for reception.</i>

584
01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:33.999
<i>Radar blackout is now complete.</i>

585
01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:36.585
(Japanese)

586
01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:51.308
(Russian radio)

587
01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:54.145
Moscow radio's already saying we did it.

588
01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:57.648
The president's called
a press conference for 2pm.

589
01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.692
He'll deny emphatically we were involved.

590
01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.986
- But can we prove it?
- Of course not.

591
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:04.738
No one will believe the Russians did it.

592
01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:07.950
Now they'll use the excuse
to shoot down our next <i>Jupiter.</i>

593
01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:11.787
<i>Houston to Washington. We followed him
for one orbit, now he's off the screen.</i>

594
01:03:11.872 --> 01:03:14.039
That means he's coming down.

595
01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:18.043
- Yeah, but where?
- Some place in Russia. It has to be.

596
01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.630
The British theory about Japan
is nonsense.

597
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.341
- Forget Japan.
- I agree.

598
01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:27.678
We've re-photographed
every square inch.

599
01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:05.591
(PA) <i>Ventilator fans to full power.</i>

600
01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:07.760
<i>Open all air ducts.</i>

601
01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:10.012
Area safe to enter.

602
01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:12.139
All crews to stations.

603
01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.808
All air ducts to normal.

604
01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:18.187
Air ducts opened.

605
01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:20.606
- Close crater.
- Closing crater.

606
01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:23.484
<i>Fire guards to station.</i>

607
01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:25.861
(Japanese)

608
01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:38.123
Ventilator fans to normal. Open shutters.

609
01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:42.586
<i>Reception complete.</i>

610
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.383
(man) Withdraw captive spaceship.

611
01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:52.388
<i>Guards to stations.</i>

612
01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:26.171
- Remove the prisoners.
- Remove the prisoners.

613
01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.362
(man) I shall be in my apartment.

614
01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:54.033
I may send for you later.

615
01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.542
(shouting in Japanese)

616
01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:25.898
I must congratulate you, gentlemen,
upon your superb equipment.

617
01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:28.817
We congratulate you, sir,
upon the way you handle it.

618
01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:32.029
Our clients are satisfied
with the progress so far?

619
01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:35.032
- My government is quite satisfied.
- Good.

620
01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:36.575
Hans!

621
01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:45.167
You will see that my piranha fish
get very hungry.

622
01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:49.797
They can strip a man to the bone
in 30 seconds.

623
01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:05.479
I have decided to ask for
a little money in advance.

624
01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:10.067
I want the sum of 100 million dollars,
in gold bullion,

625
01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:12.444
deposited in our account
in Buenos Aires.

626
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:15.489
Our agreement states
no money should be paid

627
01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:19.159
until war has broken out
between Russia and the United States.

628
01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:22.705
- This is extortion.
- Extortion is my business.

629
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:25.624
Go and think it over, gentlemen. I'm busy.

630
01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.962
<i>Osato and Number 11, report now.</i>

631
01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:48.230
An unknown Englishman
was in your office the other day.

632
01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:50.065
Correct, Number One.

633
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:53.152
- Do you know what gun this is?
- Walther PPK.

634
01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:57.239
Only one person we know
uses this sort of gun.

635
01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:00.492
James Bond.

636
01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:04.496
- But Bond is dead.
- It was in all the newspapers.

637
01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:05.831
Rubbish.

638
01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:07.666
Bond is alive.

639
01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.669
Unless you killed him, Mr Osato?

640
01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:14.006
Don't tell me you let him go.

641
01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:17.468
I gave Number 11
the strictest orders to eliminate him.

642
01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:19.511
And did she?

643
01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:21.847
She failed.

644
01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:25.225
You should have killed him.
You had plenty of opportunity.

645
01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.562
This organisation
does not tolerate failure.

646
01:08:28.646 --> 01:08:30.981
- I know, but you see, I...
- Go!

647
01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:35.110
Well?

648
01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.325
Aagghh!

649
01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:44.661
Osato! (screams)

650
01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:57.341
Kill Bond! Now!

651
01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.844
Yes, Number One. Yes. Yes, yes.

652
01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:04.056
(helicopter blades whir)

653
01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:43.846
- Hello.
- Bad news from outer space.

654
01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:47.516
Yes, I heard it. Now the Russians
are accusing the Americans.

655
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.726
Next time it will be war.

656
01:09:49.811 --> 01:09:52.646
- We'll have to get down to the volcanoes.
- I agree.

657
01:09:52.772 --> 01:09:55.649
We'll also need
a company of first-rate men.

658
01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:58.318
Do you have any commandos here?

659
01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.404
I have much, much better.

660
01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:03.282
Ninjas. Top-secret, <i>Bond-san.</i>

661
01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:06.326
This is my ninja training school.

662
01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:08.954
(all roar)

663
01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:16.545
- Ninjas?
- The art of concealment and surprise.

664
01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:38.901
(battle cry)

665
01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:55.334
This must develop
very fast reflex actions.

666
01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:56.835
And spiritual strength.

667
01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:32.788
Now, we will see some modern ninjas.

668
01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:38.251
My plan is this.

669
01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.796
I make a base on the <i>Ama</i> island.

670
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.507
100 of my ninjas will slide in unseen.

671
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.635
They will be workers and fishermen.

672
01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:48.470
- What about me?
- Later.

673
01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:52.057
But for the moment,
these will interest you. Rocket guns.

674
01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:53.725
Very powerful.

675
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.311
See the holes in the back
for jet propulsion.

676
01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.734
- It's a fine gun.
- All rocket guns.

677
01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:06.905
This is our special baby rocket.

678
01:12:07.532 --> 01:12:11.410
Very useful for people who smoke
too many cigarettes, like you.

679
01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:21.586
- Accurate up to 30 yards.
- Very neat.

680
01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:25.132
- It can save your life.
- You sound like a commercial.

681
01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:26.466
(chuckles)

682
01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:30.262
- What's the plan for me?
- First, you become a Japanese.

683
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:33.056
Second, you train hard and quickly

684
01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.642
to become a ninja like us.

685
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:39.021
And third, to give you
extra-special cover,

686
01:12:39.731 --> 01:12:41.314
you take a wife.

687
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:52.367
Regretfully impossible.

688
01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:53.952
You must marry <i>Ama</i> girl.

689
01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:56.121
One who is known on the island.

690
01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:59.791
- Is she pretty?
- She has a face like a pig.

691
01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.170
- To hell with that idea.
- But this is duty.

692
01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:04.463
(Bond) Hmph!

693
01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:08.425
The girl I have chosen
is an agent of mine.

694
01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:10.469
But first, you must become Japanese.

695
01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:12.971
(Japanese)

696
01:13:16.017 --> 01:13:18.435
- Eyepieces to Hera.
- Eyepieces to Hera.

697
01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.604
(Japanese)

698
01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:26.443
Why don't you just
dye the parts that show?

699
01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:28.653
(Japanese)

700
01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.072
(laughter)

701
01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:39.247
<i>- Konbanwa.
- Konbanwa.</i>

702
01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.507
Tiger said, from now on,

703
01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.343
you must do everything Japanese-style.

704
01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:53.095
Everything?

705
01:13:54.222 --> 01:13:55.764
Good for Tiger.

706
01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:45.582
(fights to breathe)

707
01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.295
- (gunshots)
- (groans)

708
01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:00.305
(Aki gasps)

709
01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:02.432
I'm...

710
01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:06.144
I... I...

711
01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:08.396
Aki!

712
01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:10.106
I'm... (gasps)

713
01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:18.240
(Japanese)

714
01:16:18.783 --> 01:16:20.158
She's dead.

715
01:16:21.953 --> 01:16:23.203
Poisoned.

716
01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:30.126
Tiger, we must get to that island.

717
01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:33.672
You're almost ready.
Just two more days' training.

718
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:37.259
(roars)

719
01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:04.452
(Japanese)

720
01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:07.372

721
01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.376
- (groans)
- (whistle blows)

722
01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.382
- You killed him.
- Yeah, he tried to kill me.

723
01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:24.180
This man is a stranger from outside.

724
01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:26.808
It's lucky we're getting out of here.

725
01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:31.313
Tomorrow you will be a poor Japanese
worker, with humble Japanese wife.

726
01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.481
- Yeah, with a face like a pig.
- (chuckles)

727
01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:36.396
(chants)

728
01:20:30.576 --> 01:20:32.327
(passengers chat)

729
01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:08.321
(softly) My men are already ashore.

730
01:21:08.405 --> 01:21:10.156
All over the island.

731
01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:13.451
We have four days left.
It is not much time.

732
01:21:14.662 --> 01:21:50.029
(Japanese)

733
01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:17.849
This is my house.

734
01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:22.770
My friend has made us some food.

735
01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:27.275
Do you live here alone?

736
01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:29.777
Yes. My parents are dead.

737
01:22:30.237 --> 01:22:31.863
Sit down, please.

738
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.451
Oysters.

739
01:22:37.536 --> 01:22:38.786
Is this the only room there is?

740
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:39.912
Yes.

741
01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.206
That is your bed.

742
01:22:42.875 --> 01:22:44.876
I shall sleep over there.

743
01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:50.048
- We're supposed to be married.
- Think again, please.

744
01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:51.674
You gave false name to priest.

745
01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:55.094
But we must keep up appearances!
We're on our honeymoon.

746
01:22:55.346 --> 01:22:57.722
No honeymoon. This is business.

747
01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:05.021
Well, I won't need these.

748
01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:12.028
(insects chirrup)

749
01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:37.220
<i>- Bond-san</i>.
- What's wrong?

750
01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:40.306
The Americans have changed
the launching date.

751
01:23:40.391 --> 01:23:42.100
The countdown has already started.

752
01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:45.687
The president has given
a last warning to the Russians.

753
01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:48.272
- When does it go up?
- Tonight, midnight. Our time.

754
01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:52.652
- Did your men search the island?
- Yes. There is nothing but volcanoes.

755
01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:54.696
Everything is so normal around here.

756
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.989
- Nothing happens.
- One thing has happened.

757
01:23:57.074 --> 01:23:59.951
Yesterday an <i>Ama</i> girl
rowed her boat into Ryuzaki.

758
01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:03.162
- Ryuzaki?
- It is a big cave on the mainland.

759
01:24:03.247 --> 01:24:05.289
And when her boat floated out again,

760
01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:07.917
she was dead.

761
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:11.921
- Was that the funeral we saw yesterday?
- Yes.

762
01:24:12.423 --> 01:24:14.799
- How did she die?
- Nobody knows.

763
01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.886
- Can you take me to this cave?
- Yes.

764
01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:21.681
We'll slip away from the fishing fleet
in the morning.

765
01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:04.599
All right?

766
01:25:05.309 --> 01:25:07.268
Now, where is this cave?

767
01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:09.228
It's straight across.

768
01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:11.189
The cave is over there.

769
01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.136
Gas. Get over the side.

770
01:25:42.221 --> 01:25:43.387
Quick!

771
01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:11.666
Phosgene gas, to keep the visitors away.

772
01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:15.670
Did you notice the sulphur on the walls?

773
01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:17.213
- The yellow?
- Yes.

774
01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:20.299
It was once an underground outlet
for the volcanic lava.

775
01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:23.886
- There must be a long tunnel.
- Miles of it.

776
01:26:24.763 --> 01:26:26.222
It leads all the way,

777
01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:28.182
right up to the top.

778
01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:30.560
That's where we have to go.
Can you make it?

779
01:26:30.853 --> 01:26:33.312
Of course. It's business.

780
01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.605
Good.

781
01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:44.031
(birdsong)

782
01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.209
May I rest a moment?

783
01:26:55.294 --> 01:26:56.544
Surely.

784
01:27:01.008 --> 01:27:02.842
- It's hard work.
- Mm.

785
01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:05.720
Some honeymoon!

786
01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:16.814
(helicopter)

787
01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:36.876
It's going down! Into the volcano!

789
01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:49.221

(announcements in Japanese)

791
01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.718
This volcano isn't active, is it?

792
01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:30.513
It never has been. Not in my lifetime.

793
01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:33.140
There's been some
terrific heat here recently.

794
01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.893
What happened to the helicopter?

795
01:28:36.186 --> 01:28:38.229
It's down there somewhere.

796
01:28:38.563 --> 01:28:39.814
Come on.

797
01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.819
<i>Stand by. Mark.</i>

798
01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:47.405
<i>Stand by for ten-second countdown.</i>

<i>10, 9, 8...</i>

800
01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:52.410
All units worldwide
will remain at readiness

801
01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:54.328
so long as the spacecraft is in orbit.

This is it, gentlemen.
All we can do now is wait and pray.

805
01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:37.455
(Bond) Is that deep?

806
01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:39.790
They usually are - very.

807
01:29:42.753 --> 01:29:43.961
(clanks)

808
01:29:45.088 --> 01:29:46.297
It's metal!

809
01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:47.965
Wait here.

Yes.

Yes, since six months we started training.

Good evening.

Get into their uniforms.

has been received from computers.

You made a mistake, my friend.

860

No astronaut enters the capsule
with his air conditioner.

861
01:38:34.826 --> 01:38:36.493
Remove his helmet!

I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

865
01:38:53.553 --> 01:38:55.762
They told me
you were assassinated in Hong Kong.

866
01:38:57.015 --> 01:38:58.515
Yes, this is my second life.

Track is as predicted. All computers...

871
01:39:11.321 --> 01:39:14.239
As you see,
I am about to inaugurate a little war.

872
01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:19.286
In a matter of hours, when America
and Russia have annihilated each other,

873
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:21.955
we shall see a new power
dominating the world.

874
01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:26.209

<i>Clear the area.</i>

880
01:39:50.902 --> 01:39:53.528
<i>Emergency services to stand by.</i>

881
01:39:54.947 --> 01:39:56.490
Area now clear.

882
01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:03.580
T minus one minute,
30 seconds and counting.

883
01:40:04.457 --> 01:40:07.209
Re-coordinate with target vehicle.

884
01:40:07.502 --> 01:40:10.087
Bird 1 now in readiness.

885
01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:13.507
Astronauts ready on Bird.
All systems are go.

886
01:40:14.258 --> 01:40:17.219

- Open crater.
- Opening crater.

890
01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:34.778

01:40:35.613 --> 01:40:38.031
<i>Bird 1 to liftoff position.</i>

892
01:40:56.342 --> 01:41:00.554
Gimbal the engines.
Pressurised tanks open.

893
01:41:01.472 --> 01:41:03.890
Ventilator fans to full power.

894
01:41:04.267 --> 01:41:05.350
10 seconds.

895
01:41:05.435 --> 01:41:07.018

896
01:41:07.145 --> 01:41:08.854

1, 0.

900
01:41:15.153 --> 01:41:16.486
Ignition.

901
01:41:44.056 --> 01:41:45.098
Close crater!

902
01:41:45.558 --> 01:41:47.100
Closing crater.

903
01:41:50.021 --> 01:41:51.521
Open shutters!

904
01:42:02.992 --> 01:42:04.326
(Japanese)

905
01:42:32.688 --> 01:42:35.065
<i>Bird 1 to base. Separation complete.</i>

906
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:36.900
<i>Confirm acquisition.</i>

907
01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:38.109
<i>Calling Bird 1.</i>

908
01:42:38.194 --> 01:42:42.906
<i>You are 70 nautical miles downrange.
200 miles altitude.</i>

909
01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:46.243
Hans, our job will soon be done.

910
01:42:46.869 --> 01:42:50.539
Blow them up as soon as they have
captured the Americans. Here is the key

911
01:42:51.707 --> 01:42:53.875
to operate the exploder button.

912
01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.377
There are men in the crater!

913
01:42:55.461 --> 01:42:59.256
- (siren blares)
- Crater guns, fire.

914
01:42:59.674 --> 01:43:01.424
Crater guns, open fire.

915
01:43:23.739 --> 01:43:26.199
The firing power inside my crater

916
01:43:26.284 --> 01:43:28.994
is enough to annihilate a small army.

917
01:43:29.328 --> 01:43:31.454
You can watch it all on TV.

918
01:43:31.789 --> 01:43:34.666
It's the last programme
you're likely to see.

919
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:38.461
If I'm going to be forced
to watch television, may I smoke?

920
01:43:39.630 --> 01:43:41.715
Yes. Give him his cigarettes.

921
01:43:41.799 --> 01:43:44.968
It won't be the nicotine
that kills you, Mr Bond.

922
01:44:03.279 --> 01:44:04.905
(technician)
Armed guards to control room.

923
01:44:20.463 --> 01:44:22.505
- Close the crater.
- Close crater!

924
01:44:22.590 --> 01:44:26.134
I shall look forward personally
to exterminating you, Mr Bond.

925
01:44:26.469 --> 01:44:28.178
(continuous rapid gunfire)

926
01:44:33.517 --> 01:44:35.268
(gunfire continues)

927
01:45:24.318 --> 01:45:25.902
Close the shutters.

928
01:45:34.036 --> 01:45:35.912
We are now impregnable.

929
01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.250
Interception takes place in eight minutes.
Nothing can prevent that.

930
01:47:09.173 --> 01:47:11.966
- Impregnable?
- (gives order in Japanese)

931
01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:15.386
- Come with me, Mr Bond.
<i>- Bird 1 to base. Locked on target.</i>

932
01:47:15.471 --> 01:47:17.180
- (Blofeld) Osato?
- Yes, Number One?

933
01:47:19.016 --> 01:47:20.767
<i>Base calling Bird 1.</i>

934
01:47:21.352 --> 01:47:24.896
You are to assume full control
of operation from now on.

935
01:47:25.356 --> 01:47:27.357
Seven minutes to interception.

936
01:47:27.441 --> 01:47:29.025
<i>Roger, Base One.</i>

937
01:47:30.236 --> 01:47:31.861
<i>Houston, this is Hawaii.</i>

938
01:47:31.946 --> 01:47:33.988
<i>We have an unidentified object on scope.</i>

939
01:47:34.073 --> 01:47:36.574
Order first alert. Arm all weapons.

940
01:47:37.034 --> 01:47:39.035
<i>Interception will occur in six minutes.</i>

941
01:47:46.127 --> 01:47:49.129
This is the price of failure, Mr Bond.

942
01:47:55.177 --> 01:47:56.427
Come on.

943
01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.017
(shouting)

944
01:48:07.731 --> 01:48:09.524
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

945
01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:24.247
There's an exploder button in the
control room. We've got to get up there.

946
01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:26.499
Impossible. Too well defended.

947
01:48:33.257 --> 01:48:36.885
Evacuate the control!

948
01:48:52.610 --> 01:48:54.694
(shouting in Japanese)

949
01:48:56.697 --> 01:48:59.449
Control room technicians.
There must be another way up there.

950
01:49:01.243 --> 01:49:03.286
(continuous rapid gunfire)

951
01:49:12.338 --> 01:49:14.422
Give me cover till I get to the staircase.

952
01:50:57.693 --> 01:50:59.068
(cries out)

953
01:51:00.112 --> 01:51:01.529
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

954
01:51:17.463 --> 01:51:20.506
<i>Closing fast on our vehicle.
Orbit identical.</i>

955
01:51:21.091 --> 01:51:24.344
<i>All units stand by for codeword.
Codeword is imminent.</i>

956
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:27.096
<i>I repeat, closing fast on our vehicle.</i>

957
01:51:57.628 --> 01:51:59.587
<i>It's blown up! The enemy!</i>

958
01:51:59.671 --> 01:52:02.090
<i>I repeat, the enemy has blown up.</i>

959
01:52:02.633 --> 01:52:04.926
All units will return to first alert.

960
01:52:05.010 --> 01:52:08.012
Codeword is not,
I say again, not imminent.

961
01:52:11.475 --> 01:52:12.767
Tiger...

962
01:52:14.144 --> 01:52:15.645
We've done it.

963
01:52:34.415 --> 01:52:35.998
Down the tunnel!

964
01:53:58.415 --> 01:53:59.582
Steady.

965
01:54:16.058 --> 01:54:18.226
Now... about that honeymoon.

966
01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:20.937
Why not?

967
01:54:21.146 --> 01:54:23.439
But they'll never let you stay.

968
01:54:24.233 --> 01:54:26.275
But they'll never find us.

969
01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:56.556
- Dinghy's on board, sir.
- Tell him to come below and report.

970
01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.641
It'll be a pleasure, sir.

971
01:55:11.071 --> 01:55:16.576
<i>You only live twice</i>

972
01:55:16.994 --> 01:55:22.039
<i>Or so it seems</i>

973
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.835
<i>One life for yourself</i>

974
01:55:25.919 --> 01:55:32.800
<i>And one for your dreams</i>

975
01:55:32.926 --> 01:55:38.097
<i>You drift through the years</i>

976
01:55:38.432 --> 01:55:43.728
<i>And life seems tame</i>

977
01:55:44.855 --> 01:55:47.523
<i>Till one dream appears</i>

978
01:55:47.608 --> 01:55:52.945
<i>And love is its name</i>

979
01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:59.702
<i>And love is a stranger</i>

980
01:56:00.203 --> 01:56:04.874
<i>Who'll beckon you on</i>

981
01:56:05.876 --> 01:56:09.378
<i>Don't think of the danger</i>

982
01:56:09.463 --> 01:56:14.884
<i>Or the stranger is gone</i>

983
01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:20.431
<i>This dream is for you</i>

984
01:56:20.891 --> 01:56:25.561
<i>So pay the price</i>

985
01:56:26.688 --> 01:56:29.231
<i>Make one dream come true</i>

986
01:56:29.316 --> 01:56:34.820
<i>You only live twice</i>
