1
00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.438
Calling CapeCom. CapeCom?
This is Jupiter 16.

2
00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:54.641
Give a go for fourth orbit?

3
00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:57.034
CapeCom to Jupiter 16, can you

4
00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:59.646
confirm 02 pressure
is within limit?

5
00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:03.814
Roger, everything looks good in
the environmental control system.

6
00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:06.404
Ok, everything looks
good from here.

7
00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:08.644
You have a go for fourth orbit.

8
00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:11.154
Jupiter 16, roger.

9
00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:14.741
You're stowing all loose
gear. Ready for the EVA.

10
00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:18.494
Jupiter 16, this is CapeCom. Start
your EVA anytime you're ready.

11
00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.270
Remember that you
have plenty of time

12
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:21.998
in the other EVA is
for experiments.

13
00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.105
So don't stay out too long, Chris.

14
00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:25.106
Ok, flight.

15
00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:27.342
Don't worry. We'll stick to plan.

16
00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:28.343
Roger.

17
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.759
CapeCom to Jupiter 16, on my mark
it will be four plus three seven.

18
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.468
Four, three, two, one, mark.

19
00:01:45.717 --> 00:01:49.188
CapeCom, this is Chris, I'm out.

20
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.134
- Everything looks Ok.
- Good.

21
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:54.476
The manoeuvring unit
is working this time.

22
00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:57.867
I used it to get out and it
makes things a lot easier.

23
00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:01.078
CapeCom to Hawaii, this is
flight control, come in please.

24
00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.538
Hawaii, roger.

25
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:06.610
Hawaii, we expect to start EVA
over your station on this pass.

26
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:09.430
Hawaii to Jupiter 16,
there's an unidentified

27
00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:11.881
object closing on you
fast from astern.

28
00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.232
Can you see it?

29
00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:16.461
Hawaii from CapeCom,
we have nothing here,

30
00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:18.679
hold while we check
the space track.

31
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.600
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

32
00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.359
Repeat, Hawaii to Jupiter
16, an unidentified

33
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.030
object on our scope closing fast.

34
00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:29.482
I see nothing.

35
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.744
Can you give me a bearing?

36
00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:34.999
Appears to be coming
up fast, from astern.

37
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:38.140
Hey, now I see it.

38
00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:40.634
It's another spacecraft.

39
00:02:41.032 --> 00:02:43.663
I repeat, it's another spacecraft.

40
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.082
Does it look like a close pass?

41
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.959
You're breaking up. Say again.

42
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.955
Repeat, does it look
like a close pass?

43
00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:51.427
Hey Chris, what's happening?

44
00:02:51.428 --> 00:02:54.937
It's coming right at us,
the front is opening

45
00:02:54.938 --> 00:02:57.912
up, I repeat, the
front is opening up.

46
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.772
- It's coming right at us.
- Chris, get back in, get back in.

47
00:03:03.168 --> 00:03:07.368
Do you read me? You're breaking
up. Repeat, you're breaking up.

48
00:03:07.398 --> 00:03:09.284
What's happening?

49
00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.983
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

50
00:03:13.013 --> 00:03:17.030
You're breaking up. Come in,
please, over. Jupiter 16.

51
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.330
You're breaking up,
my lead line...

52
00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:33.600
Hawaii to Jupiter 16,
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

53
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.632
Are you receiving me?
Come in, please. Over.

54
00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:39.006
Hello Houston, we've
lost our radio

55
00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:41.804
contact. We've also
lost him on the scope.

56
00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.341
Unidentified object
is still orbiting.

57
00:03:44.342 --> 00:03:47.072
Alert all stations and
track him closely.

58
00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.956
It is ridiculous for
the Soviet government

59
00:03:57.957 --> 00:03:59.780
to deny responsibility
in this matter.

60
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:03.326
The Soviet government denies
all knowledge of this affair.

61
00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:06.037
The world knows we are
a peace-loving people.

62
00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:08.972
I hereby give notice
that in 20 days time...

63
00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.791
the United States
intents to launch

64
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.335
her next spaceship into orbit.

65
00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:14.545
My government has instructed
me to inform you...

66
00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:17.021
that any interference
with the spaceship

67
00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:19.133
will be regarded as an act of war.

68
00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.010
May I ask what motive...

69
00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.853
our Russian friends
would've for wishing

70
00:04:23.854 --> 00:04:25.681
to destroy American spacecraft?

71
00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:29.268
My government sees this as nothing
less than a blatant attempt...

72
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.553
to gain complete and
absolute control

73
00:04:31.554 --> 00:04:33.898
of space itself for
military purposes.

74
00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.136
We don't agree.

75
00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.611
Her Majesty's Government
is not convinced...

76
00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:42.346
that this intruder missile
originated from Soviet Russia.

77
00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:43.924
Our tracking station in Singapore

78
00:04:43.925 --> 00:04:45.813
reported faint echoes
of this craft...

79
00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:48.345
coming down the Sea of Japan area.

80
00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.837
Might I suggest
gentleman, that this...

81
00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:54.293
is where you should concentrate
your intelligence forces.

82
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.326
The prime minister
asked me to assure

83
00:04:56.327 --> 00:04:58.464
you that this is what
we propose to do.

84
00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:02.599
As a matter of fact, our man in
Hong Kong is working on it now.

85
00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.670
Why do Chinese girls taste
different from all other girls?

86
00:05:13.671 --> 00:05:15.815
You think we better?

87
00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.664
No, just different.

88
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.982
Like Peking duck is different from

89
00:05:19.983 --> 00:05:22.028
Russian caviar but
I love them both.

90
00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.698
Darling, I give you
very best duck.

91
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.314
Oh, would be lovely.

92
00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:29.483
We've had some interesting times

93
00:05:29.484 --> 00:05:31.878
together Ling, I'll
be sorry to go.

94
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.604
Take that door.

95
00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:56.272
The bed.

96
00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.290
We're too late.

97
00:06:05.291 --> 00:06:08.013
Well, at least he died on the job.

98
00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.694
He would wanted it this way.

in a moment, in the twinkling
of an eye, at the last trump.

125
00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:29.791
For the trumpet
shall sound and the

126
00:09:29.792 --> 00:09:31.654
dead shall be raised
incorruptible...

127
00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:33.951
and we shall all be
changed, we therefore

128
00:09:33.952 --> 00:09:35.645
commit his body to the deep...

129
00:09:35.646 --> 00:09:37.580
to be turned into corruption,

130
00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:40.324
Looking for the
resurrection of the body

131
00:09:40.325 --> 00:09:42.728
when the sea shall
give up her dead.

132
00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.027
Present.

133
00:09:46.444 --> 00:09:47.492
Fire.

134
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.316
- Carry on.
- Aye aye, sir.

135
00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:29.308
Request permission
to come aboard, sir?

136
00:11:29.309 --> 00:11:31.509
- Permission granted.
- Thank you.

137
00:11:33.921 --> 00:11:36.255
- Take this officer AFT.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.912
Number One, take her up to
90ft. Course zero four five.

139
00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:45.913
Aye aye, sir.

140
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.172
- Hello Penny.
- You better go right in.

141
00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:58.008
You're late as usual, even
from your own funeral.

142
00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:01.276
Well, we corpses about
should be no sense of time.

143
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.604
In you go, sir.

144
00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.401
Thank you, ma'am.

145
00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:18.611
- Oh, sit down 007.
- Thank you sir.

146
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.785
- No ill effects?
- None at all, sir.

147
00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.459
Well, now you're dead,

148
00:12:24.658 --> 00:12:26.494
perhaps some of your
old friends will pay a

149
00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:28.247
little less attention
to you for a while.

150
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.248
Give you more elbow room.
You'll need it, too.

151
00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:34.161
This is the big one
007. That's why I'm out

152
00:12:34.162 --> 00:12:36.422
here myself I'm taking
you fully briefed.

153
00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:39.425
Oh yes sir, but there's one
thing I don't understand.

154
00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.769
If our Singapore tracking
station is correct

155
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.955
about the rocket not
landing in Russia...

156
00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:46.677
- then, where did it land?
- We assume it's Japan.

157
00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:48.981
Mind you, all this
is pure guesswork.

158
00:12:48.982 --> 00:12:51.311
But the P.M. wants us to play
it with everything we've got.

159
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.110
And the aerial reconnaissance?

160
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:55.190
Every inch photographed, nothing.

161
00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:58.068
Are the Japanese equipped
to launch such a rocket?

162
00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:00.459
- We don't think so.
- Then who else is?

163
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.497
That's what you've
got to find out and

164
00:13:02.498 --> 00:13:04.533
fast, before the real
shooting starts.

165
00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:07.934
This damn thing could blow
up into a full-scale war.

166
00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:12.706
When you get to Tokyo, go
to that name and address.

167
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.664
Our man Henderson will
contact you there.

168
00:13:15.665 --> 00:13:16.665
Henderson?

169
00:13:16.666 --> 00:13:18.936
Captain here, we're
underway, full ahead.

170
00:13:18.937 --> 00:13:19.937
Right.

171
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:24.761
- Well, that's all.
- Thank you, sir.

172
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:26.680
- 007.
- Sir?

173
00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:29.683
We've only three weeks before the
American launch the next one.

174
00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.185
- You know that?
- Oh, yes sir.

175
00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.460
And my sources tell
me the Russians are

176
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:35.564
planning one even
earlier than that.

177
00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:38.034
- So move fast 007.
- Yes sir.

178
00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:47.440
Oh, by the way, how was the girl?

179
00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:49.703
Which girl?

180
00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:52.170
The Chinese one we
fixed you up with.

181
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:55.483
Another five minutes,
I'd have found out.

182
00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:58.186
She'll never know what she missed.

183
00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.241
Miss Moneypenny, give
007 the password

184
00:14:01.242 --> 00:14:03.280
we've agreed with Japanese SIS.

185
00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:04.301
Yes, sir.

186
00:14:05.216 --> 00:14:08.336
We tried to think of something
that you wouldn't forget.

187
00:14:08.337 --> 00:14:09.337
Yes?

188
00:14:10.454 --> 00:14:12.970
I love you.

189
00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.476
Repeat it please, to
make sure you get it.

190
00:14:16.477 --> 00:14:18.095
Don't worry, I get it.

191
00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:19.525
Sayonara.

192
00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:21.773
James, good luck.

193
00:14:23.183 --> 00:14:25.631
Instant Japanese. You may need it.

194
00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:30.858
You forget, I took a first in
oriental languages at Cambridge.

195
00:14:36.296 --> 00:14:37.700
Stand by to load.

196
00:14:39.662 --> 00:14:41.318
Lift to the launch.

197
00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:49.706
Tube loaded. Hubcap open.

198
00:14:53.882 --> 00:14:55.196
Fire.

199
00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:01.752
(speaks Japanese)

200
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:16.718
(Japanese)

201
00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:42.990
This is your ticket.

202
00:16:47.536 --> 00:16:48.536
Thank you.

203
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.550
Dozo.

204
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.638
(instructions shouted in Japanese)

205
00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:28.230
I love you.

206
00:18:29.986 --> 00:18:31.583
I have a car nearby.

207
00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:35.495
- Where do you suggest we go?
- I know a quiet hotel.

208
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:41.339
- And?
- Where your friend is waiting.

209
00:18:43.512 --> 00:18:44.677
Mr Henderson.

210
00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:52.052
Wasn't Mr Henderson
able to come himself?

211
00:18:52.053 --> 00:18:53.279
I suppose not.

212
00:18:53.476 --> 00:18:56.048
- Why?
- He didn't say.

213
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:13.967
Well. I think it's
about hotel-time.

214
00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:42.871
How long have been
working for Henderson?

215
00:19:42.872 --> 00:19:45.198
Long enough to learn
not to discuss

216
00:19:45.199 --> 00:19:47.072
such matters with strangers.

217
00:19:57.196 --> 00:20:00.699
(Japanese)

218
00:20:06.833 --> 00:20:10.542
- Mr Henderson is waiting for you.
- You're not coming in with me?

219
00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:13.297
Mr Henderson would
like to see you alone.

220
00:20:23.592 --> 00:20:24.592
Do come in.

221
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.286
Mr Henderson?

222
00:20:29.906 --> 00:20:31.129
At your service.

223
00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:50.957
I believe you wanted to
ask me some questions.

224
00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:53.736
Yes, excuse me.

225
00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:01.259
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you got it right.

226
00:21:02.136 --> 00:21:04.922
I lost that in Singapore in 42.

227
00:21:06.215 --> 00:21:09.017
You must excuse this
rather odd mixture of

228
00:21:09.018 --> 00:21:11.949
styles but I refuse to
go entirely Japanese.

229
00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:14.597
Very fond of some of
these old things.

230
00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:19.319
You've never been to
Japan before, have you?

231
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320
No, never.

232
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.808
I myself have lived here for...

233
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.380
28 years.

234
00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:28.578
And I'm just beginning
to know my way about.

235
00:21:28.579 --> 00:21:31.050
Your most vital contact
will be Tanaka.

236
00:21:31.051 --> 00:21:32.051
Tanaka?

237
00:21:32.052 --> 00:21:34.542
He's head of the
Japanese secret service.

238
00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:38.873
And his identity is the most
closely guarded secret in Japan.

239
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.413
When can I see him?

240
00:21:41.884 --> 00:21:44.701
- You can see Tiger tonight.
- Tiger?

241
00:21:45.205 --> 00:21:48.539
His closest friends are
permitted to call him that.

242
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:49.939
You've any leads of your own?

243
00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:54.104
Yes, I do. Oh, that's stirred
not shaken. That was right?

244
00:21:54.827 --> 00:21:57.690
- Perfect.
- Cheers.

245
00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:01.736
Russian vodka. Well done.

246
00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:05.271
Yes, I get it from the doorman
at the Russian embassy.

247
00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:07.467
Amongst certain other things.

248
00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:09.035
Now, look.

249
00:22:09.905 --> 00:22:12.344
I think London's theory
about the missile

250
00:22:12.345 --> 00:22:14.666
being fired from this
country is right.

251
00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:16.994
I don't know how
or where and don't

252
00:22:16.995 --> 00:22:18.934
ask me who's doing it either.

253
00:22:19.424 --> 00:22:20.424
But

254
00:22:21.028 --> 00:22:23.672
I'd have a shrewd
idea that a major

255
00:22:23.673 --> 00:22:26.023
foreign power is behind it all.

256
00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:28.723
You mean, apart from
Russia and Japan?

257
00:22:28.724 --> 00:22:31.654
It's not Russia old
boy, I'm sure of that.

258
00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:33.745
It's not Japan either.

259
00:22:34.015 --> 00:22:38.296
Although a large Japanese
industrial concern is...

260
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.185
(Japanese)

261
00:24:38.829 --> 00:24:39.894
Good evening.

262
00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:07.815
Cheers.

263
00:26:13.148 --> 00:26:14.446
Siamese vodka?

264
00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:41.284
(shouting in Japanese)

265
00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:51.586
There he is.

266
00:27:53.209 --> 00:27:54.209
Freeze.

267
00:27:58.469 --> 00:28:00.345
(shouting in Japanese)

268
00:28:10.926 --> 00:28:12.284
Get in, quick.

269
00:28:20.214 --> 00:28:22.348
Now, what the hell is the score?

270
00:28:22.618 --> 00:28:25.405
What do you mean? My
job is to help you.

271
00:28:25.406 --> 00:28:27.285
Like you helped Henderson?

272
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:29.689
I'm taking you to a
place of safety.

273
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.954
No, this time I'm
taking you. I want

274
00:28:31.955 --> 00:28:33.920
some information, I want it now.

275
00:28:33.921 --> 00:28:36.319
I have no information to give you.

276
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.588
We'll see about that, slow down.

277
00:29:29.852 --> 00:29:30.932
Welcome.

278
00:29:34.975 --> 00:29:36.788
Welcome to Japan, Mr Bond.

279
00:29:38.527 --> 00:29:41.394
It is a great pleasure
to meet you at last.

280
00:29:42.364 --> 00:29:44.964
And how do you like
our country so far?

281
00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:50.800
I am a trifle disappointed at the

282
00:29:50.801 --> 00:29:53.263
ease with which I
could pull you in.

283
00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:56.711
The one thing my honourable
mother taught me long ago...

284
00:29:56.712 --> 00:29:59.714
was never to get into a
car with a strange girl.

285
00:29:59.715 --> 00:30:03.579
But you, I'm afraid, will get
into anything with any girl.

286
00:30:08.182 --> 00:30:12.182
I must say, you have a lot of
energy for a dead man, Mr Bond.

287
00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:19.800
You are James Bond, aren't you?

288
00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:27.519
I am so very pleased to meet
you, Bond-San. I really am.

289
00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:30.368
Permit me to introduce myself.

290
00:30:30.496 --> 00:30:33.303
My name is Tanaka.
Please call me Tiger.

291
00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:37.084
If you're Tanaka, how
do you feel about me?

292
00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:40.046
I love you.

293
00:30:41.048 --> 00:30:43.115
I'm glad we got out of the way.

294
00:30:43.678 --> 00:30:46.684
I'd like you to examine
these as soon as possible.

295
00:30:46.685 --> 00:30:48.419
They're from Osato's safe.

296
00:30:51.975 --> 00:30:54.949
This is an order for
naval stores. 500

297
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.922
kilos of butter, 50
containers of lox.

298
00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:00.107
What is lox?

299
00:31:00.108 --> 00:31:02.774
Oh, is American name
for smoked salmon.

300
00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:07.259
But it's also the
technical name for

301
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.534
liquid oxygen, which
makes rocket fuel.

302
00:31:09.535 --> 00:31:11.369
- Very interesting.
- Yes.

303
00:31:11.453 --> 00:31:12.453
We must go.

304
00:31:13.455 --> 00:31:16.582
The journey out will be more
dignified than the journey in.

305
00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:18.626
Oh, I wouldn't be difficult.

306
00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:22.145
- I'd like that negative enlarged.
- Ok.

307
00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:26.717
(Japanese)

308
00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:32.822
My private train. I never
travel in the streets of Tokyo.

309
00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:36.310
In my position, it
would be most unwise.

310
00:31:40.563 --> 00:31:41.816
Very convenient.

311
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.900
I imagine that your Mr M in
London has a similar arrangement.

312
00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:47.905
M? Oh yes, but of course.

313
00:31:48.824 --> 00:31:51.033
Then the girl of the white
sports car is one of us.

314
00:31:51.034 --> 00:31:53.627
- Aki? Yes.
- Very competent.

315
00:31:53.996 --> 00:31:55.162
- Domo arigato.
- Dozo.

316
00:31:55.163 --> 00:31:58.846
You like Japanese sake Mr Bond, or
would you prefer vodka Martini?

317
00:31:58.847 --> 00:32:00.543
Oh no, I like sake.

318
00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:06.007
Especially when it's served
at the correct temperature.

319
00:32:06.008 --> 00:32:08.313
98.4° Fahrenheit, like this is.

320
00:32:08.343 --> 00:32:11.143
For a European, you are
exceptionally cultivated.

321
00:32:11.479 --> 00:32:12.813
(Japanese)

322
00:32:13.695 --> 00:32:15.896
We'll see the
photograph you found.

323
00:32:15.897 --> 00:32:16.897
Good.

324
00:32:22.985 --> 00:32:25.860
Is just a ship and a strip of
land. It could be anywhere.

325
00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:28.861
My men found a microdot
on the paper, enlarge.

326
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:32.791
Says, Photograph taken by female

327
00:32:32.792 --> 00:32:35.328
American tourist
from coastal vessel.

328
00:32:35.704 --> 00:32:39.081
The woman has been liquidated
as a routine precaution.

329
00:32:39.082 --> 00:32:42.149
- Can we see the photograph again?
- Of course.

330
00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:46.297
So they killed an innocent
tourist for taking this?

331
00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:47.832
Can you make it bigger?

332
00:32:48.955 --> 00:32:49.969
Ning-Po.

333
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.012
Check motor vessel
Ning-Po, full details.

334
00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:56.030
All recent movements and
present whereabouts.

335
00:32:57.684 --> 00:33:00.751
- What's that on the left?
- Focus on the left.

336
00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:03.606
Ama, diving girls.

337
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.157
- Can you identify that coastline?
- Given time, yes.

338
00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:15.692
Who is the head of
Osato Chemicals?

339
00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:16.693
Mr Osato.

340
00:33:16.703 --> 00:33:18.954
Can you arrange for me to have an
appointment with him tomorrow?

341
00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:20.289
Of course.

342
00:33:20.374 --> 00:33:22.846
But tonight, consider
my house yours.

343
00:33:22.847 --> 00:33:25.708
Including all of my
possessions, naturally.

344
00:33:34.763 --> 00:33:37.841
My friend, now you take
your first civilised bath.

345
00:33:37.842 --> 00:33:40.267
Really? Well, I like the plumbing.

346
00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:44.194
Place yourself entirely in
their hands, my dear Bond-San.

347
00:33:44.195 --> 00:33:47.740
Rule number one, is never
do anything for yourself

348
00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:50.111
when someone else
can do it for you.

349
00:33:50.112 --> 00:33:52.446
- And number two?
- Rule number two.

350
00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:56.242
In Japan, men always come
first, women come second.

351
00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.527
I might just retire to here.

352
00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:08.076
Your English girls would never
perform this simple service.

353
00:34:08.588 --> 00:34:10.965
I think I know one or two
who might get round to it.

354
00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:12.633
Miss Moneypenny, perhaps?

355
00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:16.402
We have our sources,
Bond-San, just like you.

356
00:34:17.097 --> 00:34:19.697
Don't get the soap
in my eye, will you?

357
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.183
(Japanese)

358
00:34:26.648 --> 00:34:29.627
I suppose you know what it is
about you that fascinates them.

359
00:34:29.628 --> 00:34:32.039
It's the hair on
your chest. Japanese

360
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.196
men all have beautiful bare skin.

361
00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:36.342
Japanese proverb say,

362
00:34:36.867 --> 00:34:39.363
Bird never make nest in bare tree.

363
00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:47.001
If Henderson's theory is right...

364
00:34:47.002 --> 00:34:50.838
why would a foreign power want
to launch missiles from Japan?

365
00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:52.595
Because if ever they
were discovered,

366
00:34:52.596 --> 00:34:54.258
they could deny all
responsibility.

367
00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:57.762
Especially if some private
organisation is doing the work.

368
00:34:57.763 --> 00:34:59.764
- Osato?
- Perhaps.

369
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.434
Mr Osato is one of the greatest
industrialists in Japan.

370
00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:05.035
No, he's merely a front.

371
00:35:05.581 --> 00:35:07.581
- Who is big enough?
- SPECTRE.

372
00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:08.606
Could be.

373
00:35:09.232 --> 00:35:12.026
Now, massage. Which
girl do you select?

374
00:35:18.286 --> 00:35:20.090
I'll just settle for this
little old lady here.

375
00:35:20.091 --> 00:35:21.091
Good choice.

376
00:35:21.536 --> 00:35:22.852
She's very sexyful.

377
00:35:30.754 --> 00:35:35.011
The last time someone gave me
a massage was in Hong Kong.

378
00:35:36.468 --> 00:35:40.525
But unfortunately, I
take out it short.

379
00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:43.755
We were rudely interrupted
by a couple of gunmen.

380
00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:47.618
So, we never got around
to finishing it.

381
00:35:48.897 --> 00:35:51.269
This time, you shall finish it.

382
00:35:54.277 --> 00:35:55.528
Aki.

383
00:36:02.577 --> 00:36:04.954
No one will disturb you tonight.

384
00:36:09.543 --> 00:36:13.045
I think I will enjoy very
much serving under you.

385
00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:40.573
- Mr Fisher?
- Yes.

386
00:36:40.657 --> 00:36:42.724
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

387
00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.067
Please come in, Mr Fisher.

388
00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:54.919
- Mr Osato is expecting you.
- Thank you.

389
00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:58.780
You are three and a half minutes
early. Please be seated.

390
00:38:25.553 --> 00:38:28.420
- How do you do, Mr Fisher?
- How do you do?

391
00:38:28.598 --> 00:38:31.196
Miss Grant, my
confidential secretary.

392
00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:33.083
- Hello.
- Hello.

393
00:38:33.113 --> 00:38:35.281
May we offer you a glass
of champagne, Mr Fisher?

394
00:38:35.282 --> 00:38:37.773
No, thank you, it's just too
early in the morning for me.

395
00:38:37.774 --> 00:38:39.974
- You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.

396
00:38:40.068 --> 00:38:43.735
I always take a glass in the
morning, you should try it.

397
00:38:43.918 --> 00:38:45.052
It's bad for your liver, isn't it?

398
00:38:45.053 --> 00:38:48.057
Nonsense, it adds a
sparkle to the day.

399
00:38:48.058 --> 00:38:49.201
Sure it does.

400
00:38:56.001 --> 00:38:58.369
A Dom Perignon 59, Mr Fisher.

401
00:38:59.045 --> 00:39:01.600
Are you really sure you
won't change your mind?

402
00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:02.935
Well, if you insist.

403
00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:05.892
- Please be seated, Mr Fisher.
- Thank you.

404
00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:14.787
So, you are the new managing
director of Empire Chemicals?

405
00:39:14.788 --> 00:39:15.788
Yes.

406
00:39:15.789 --> 00:39:18.268
- What happened to Williamson?
- Williamson?

407
00:39:18.269 --> 00:39:21.136
Oh yes, he died rather
suddenly, poor chap.

408
00:39:21.327 --> 00:39:22.911
Ah, so. From what?

409
00:39:23.353 --> 00:39:25.529
He fell into a
pulveriser at the works.

410
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:26.947
Ah, so?

411
00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:28.620
How shocking.

412
00:39:30.535 --> 00:39:32.878
A very honourable
death, all the same.

413
00:39:32.879 --> 00:39:33.879
Very.

414
00:39:34.164 --> 00:39:36.698
He gained great face
with the company.

415
00:39:37.292 --> 00:39:41.288
I hope you are not taking any
risks for yourself, Mr Fisher.

416
00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:43.596
Me? I never take any risks.

417
00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:46.381
You forgive me for
saying so, but...

418
00:39:47.532 --> 00:39:49.719
I think you are taking one now.

419
00:39:50.916 --> 00:39:51.916
I am?

420
00:39:52.504 --> 00:39:54.230
You should give up smoking.

421
00:39:54.231 --> 00:39:56.310
Cigarettes are very
bad for your chest.

422
00:39:56.311 --> 00:39:59.042
Mr Osato believes
in a healthy chest.

423
00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:00.564
Really?

424
00:40:00.815 --> 00:40:04.318
Now then, you must tell me what
I can do for you, Mr Fisher?

425
00:40:04.319 --> 00:40:07.814
Well, we're interested in the bulk
buying of fermentation chemicals.

426
00:40:07.815 --> 00:40:11.188
Monosodium glutamate
and ascorbic acid.

427
00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:14.172
Would you like a licence
for manufacture?

428
00:40:14.173 --> 00:40:15.320
Yes, very much.

429
00:40:15.321 --> 00:40:16.321
So...

430
00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.709
I'll have my sales manager
get the quotations

431
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:21.919
and the delivery dates for
you as soon as possible.

432
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.297
We'll contact you later
today at your hotel.

433
00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:28.573
Which hotel are you
staying at, Mr Fisher?

434
00:40:28.574 --> 00:40:29.574
The Hilton.

435
00:40:30.345 --> 00:40:31.673
Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

436
00:40:31.903 --> 00:40:35.570
- A pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure to meet you, too.

437
00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:39.785
- Goodbye, Miss Brandt.
- Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

438
00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:44.316
Kill him.

439
00:41:02.016 --> 00:41:03.029
Get down.

440
00:41:45.235 --> 00:41:48.380
294 here. Tiger, immediate.

441
00:41:49.132 --> 00:41:50.674
Come in, 294.

442
00:41:50.758 --> 00:41:55.679
Zero-zero is with me. We are being
chased by gunmen, in black sedan.

443
00:41:55.763 --> 00:42:00.354
I'm heading south for Highway Two,
arrange usual reception, please.

444
00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:37.766
How's that for
Japanese efficiency?

445
00:43:37.767 --> 00:43:39.576
Just a drop in the ocean.

446
00:43:41.767 --> 00:43:43.745
- Zero-zero?
- Yes, Tiger.

447
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:47.165
Report that Ning-Po is owned
by Osato Chemicals, Tokyo.

448
00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:48.317
That fits. Go on.

449
00:43:48.318 --> 00:43:51.044
Vessel at present,
loading in Kobe docks.

450
00:43:51.045 --> 00:43:54.168
Sailing for Shanghai
at 5pm this afternoon.

451
00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:58.816
Suggest you proceed Kobe
immediately to look her over.

452
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.154
- Can we make it?
- Yes, just.

453
00:44:01.723 --> 00:44:05.838
Proceeding immediately, Kobe
docks, Tiger, contact M.

454
00:44:06.728 --> 00:44:10.528
Tell him to send Little Nellie.
Repeat, Little Nellie.

455
00:44:11.274 --> 00:44:14.067
Suggest she'd be
accompanied by her father.

456
00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:16.668
- Most urgent, understood?
- Understood.

457
00:44:43.639 --> 00:44:46.350
Condensation ice-cold,
liquid oxygen.

458
00:45:06.371 --> 00:45:08.372
(shouting in Japanese)

459
00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:19.682
Get out of here, contact Tanaka.

460
00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:21.284
I'm not leaving you.

461
00:45:21.761 --> 00:45:25.095
Tell him keep that ship
shadowed wherever she goes.

462
00:45:25.551 --> 00:45:26.551
Go now.

463
00:46:56.397 --> 00:46:58.007
Take him to Number 11.

464
00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:03.672
- Wake him up.
- Are you finished?

465
00:47:05.435 --> 00:47:06.658
Where am I?

466
00:47:07.325 --> 00:47:09.592
You're in my cabin on the Ning-Po.

467
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.330
Leave him to me now, wait
in there and shut the door.

468
00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:15.665
I've got you now.

469
00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.221
Well, enjoy yourself.

470
00:47:19.879 --> 00:47:23.340
- Who are you working for?
- Empire Chemicals, you know that.

471
00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:27.010
- Do all their people carry guns?
- When they're abroad, yes.

472
00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:29.878
And why were you snooping
around the docks?

473
00:47:30.598 --> 00:47:33.350
I like ships and I
used to be a sailor.

474
00:47:34.032 --> 00:47:35.219
You are a liar.

475
00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:44.626
- Do you know what this is?
- I'd rather not.

476
00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:47.269
Plastic surgeons
call it a dermatome.

477
00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:50.283
They use it to slice off skin.

478
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:55.729
I hope you won't
force me to use it.

479
00:48:04.799 --> 00:48:08.733
Now, what's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

480
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:21.532
- I have a confession to make.
- What?

481
00:48:22.483 --> 00:48:24.968
Actually, I'm a spy.

482
00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:26.892
I know that.

483
00:48:32.665 --> 00:48:36.599
I suppose you know that industrial
secrets are big business?

484
00:48:37.623 --> 00:48:40.177
Well, I've stolen
Osato's new process

485
00:48:40.178 --> 00:48:42.395
for making monosodium glutamate.

486
00:48:43.284 --> 00:48:44.284
And...

487
00:48:44.804 --> 00:48:45.886
Well, it's worth

488
00:48:46.716 --> 00:48:48.717
$300,000?

489
00:48:49.468 --> 00:48:50.468
So?

490
00:48:50.469 --> 00:48:52.961
Well, I'll split it
with you if you'll

491
00:48:52.962 --> 00:48:55.390
get me out of here
and back to Tokyo.

492
00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:57.392
Is a nice offer.

493
00:48:58.019 --> 00:49:01.543
- How about it?
- I'm afraid not.

494
00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:02.772
Why?

495
00:49:08.529 --> 00:49:10.305
Osato would kill me.

496
00:49:14.564 --> 00:49:17.704
We could fly to Europe
tomorrow, you and I.

497
00:49:42.923 --> 00:49:45.065
Oh, the things I do for England.

498
00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:58.036
Now, you are going
to need some very

499
00:49:58.037 --> 00:49:59.913
close protection tonight in Tokyo

500
00:49:59.914 --> 00:50:03.381
because, well that's when
they'll try and get at you.

501
00:50:03.918 --> 00:50:06.482
You'll need the
best man we've got.

502
00:50:06.483 --> 00:50:08.236
And who do you suggest?

503
00:50:08.923 --> 00:50:10.861
Well, me.

504
00:50:11.759 --> 00:50:15.493
I'm afraid I have another
appointment tonight, Mr Fisher.

505
00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:20.314
I'm awfully sorry to leave
you but I have to get off.

506
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.772
Chasing girls will
be the end of you,

507
00:51:19.773 --> 00:51:21.536
Bond-San, I have told you before.

508
00:51:21.537 --> 00:51:24.457
He didn't chase her, he
did it so I could get

509
00:51:24.458 --> 00:51:27.250
away. He wouldn't touch
that horrible girl.

510
00:51:27.251 --> 00:51:30.052
- You wouldn't, would you?
- Heaven forbid.

511
00:51:30.332 --> 00:51:31.733
- Any progress?
- Yes.

512
00:51:31.794 --> 00:51:34.171
We have identified the
coastline in the photograph.

513
00:51:34.172 --> 00:51:36.823
It is an island called
Matsu and lays in the

514
00:51:36.824 --> 00:51:39.179
direct route between
Kobe and Shanghai.

515
00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.748
We shadowed the Ning-Po
in a helicopter.

516
00:51:41.749 --> 00:51:43.266
- Did it stop at the island?
- I think so.

517
00:51:43.267 --> 00:51:44.780
It was a very dark night.

518
00:51:44.781 --> 00:51:47.020
Impossible to see
her all the time.

519
00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:50.221
But we know she stopped
somewhere, look at these.

520
00:51:50.691 --> 00:51:52.634
That one we took last night.

521
00:51:54.028 --> 00:51:56.228
And that one, early this morning.

522
00:51:57.782 --> 00:52:00.982
- Notice, please, the water line.
- You're right.

523
00:52:01.577 --> 00:52:03.773
Fully laden here and empty here.

524
00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:07.332
I want to take a fast
look at the island now.

525
00:52:07.333 --> 00:52:09.691
- Has Little Nellie arrived yet?
- Yes, and her father.

526
00:52:09.692 --> 00:52:10.692
Good.

527
00:52:12.254 --> 00:52:15.507
Welcome to Japan Dad. Is my
little girl hot and ready?

528
00:52:15.508 --> 00:52:17.646
Look 007, I've had
a long and tiring

529
00:52:17.647 --> 00:52:19.552
journey, probably to no purpose.

530
00:52:19.553 --> 00:52:22.420
And I'm in no mood for
your juvenile quips.

531
00:52:40.199 --> 00:52:43.588
I have much curiosity, Bond-San.
What is Little Nellie?

532
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:47.102
Oh, she's a wonderful girl.
Very small, quite fast.

533
00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:52.045
- Can do anything, just your type.
- A toy helicopter?

534
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:55.651
No, it's certainly not
a toy, you'll see.

535
00:52:56.257 --> 00:52:58.159
We've made one or two
improvements since you

536
00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.849
used her last. I'll
give you the drill.

537
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:02.587
This can only be for children.
Don't use it, Bond-San.

538
00:53:02.588 --> 00:53:04.388
Take my helicopter instead.

539
00:53:06.267 --> 00:53:08.017
Right, now pay attention.

540
00:53:08.102 --> 00:53:11.133
- Two machine guns, fixed.
- Synchronised to what?

541
00:53:11.134 --> 00:53:14.601
100 yards and using incendiaries
and high explosives.

542
00:53:14.628 --> 00:53:16.025
Two rocket launchers.

543
00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:18.764
- Forward-firing on either side.
- Fine.

544
00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:23.449
Now, these fire heat-seeking
air-to-air missiles, 60 a minute.

545
00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:24.534
Good.

546
00:53:25.077 --> 00:53:27.662
Flame guns, two of
them. Firing astern.

547
00:53:27.663 --> 00:53:28.663
What range?

548
00:53:28.664 --> 00:53:31.564
80 yards. Two smoke
ejectors next door.

549
00:53:32.877 --> 00:53:33.877
Aerial mines.

550
00:53:34.026 --> 00:53:37.626
Now remember, use them only
when directly above target.

551
00:53:37.952 --> 00:53:40.622
That's about the lot, I think.
You know the rest, don't you?

552
00:53:40.623 --> 00:53:41.623
Yes.

553
00:53:42.551 --> 00:53:43.660
Cine camera.

554
00:53:44.305 --> 00:53:46.692
Tanaka, listen in
on 410 megacycles.

555
00:53:46.693 --> 00:53:48.099
Good luck, Bond-San.

556
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.146
I'll contact you when I
get over the island.

557
00:53:51.147 --> 00:53:52.701
Be careful, Bond-San.

558
00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:56.192
Hello Base One, I'm
over the island now.

559
00:54:56.193 --> 00:54:59.092
Have seen the fishing
village. Nothing to report.

560
00:54:59.093 --> 00:55:00.986
Ok, we'll keep listening.

561
00:55:29.229 --> 00:55:32.629
Hello, Base One. There's
nothing here but volcanoes.

562
00:55:32.871 --> 00:55:34.528
Understood. Carry on.

563
00:58:32.759 --> 00:58:34.385
- Hello Base One.
- Listening.

564
00:58:34.386 --> 00:58:36.610
Little Nellie got a
hot reception. Four

565
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:39.056
big-shots made improper
advances toward us,

566
00:58:39.057 --> 00:58:41.767
But she defended her
honour with great success.

567
00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:44.937
- Heading for home.
- Do not come home, Bond-San.

568
00:58:44.938 --> 00:58:46.805
Russian space shot imminent.

569
00:58:46.857 --> 00:58:49.859
Proceed vector 4-6 degrees
and await instructions.

570
00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.917
- Understood?
- Roger and out.

571
00:58:58.952 --> 00:59:00.119
Tri,

572
00:59:00.537 --> 00:59:01.787
dva,

573
00:59:01.872 --> 00:59:03.915
edin. Shiganya.

574
00:59:33.487 --> 00:59:35.279
(speaks Russian)

575
01:00:58.447 --> 01:00:59.739
(Russian)

576
01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:10.476
Clear the area. Clear the area.

577
01:02:12.104 --> 01:02:14.355
(announcements in Japanese)

578
01:02:20.559 --> 01:02:26.045
Prepare for reception.
Prepare for reception.

579
01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:34.336
Radar blackout is now complete.
Radar blackout is now complete.

580
01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:36.585
(Japanese)

581
01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:54.518
Moscow radio is already
saying that we did it.

582
01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.565
The president is called a
press conference for 2 P.M.

583
01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.834
He'll deny emphatically we
have anything to do with it.

584
01:02:59.835 --> 01:03:02.027
- But can we prove it?
- Of course we can't.

585
01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.347
The world isn't going
to believe the

586
01:03:03.348 --> 01:03:04.738
Russians destroy their
own spacecraft.

587
01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:07.950
And now they'll use the excuse
to shoot down our next Jupiter.

588
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.958
Houston to Washington,
we followed him for

589
01:03:09.959 --> 01:03:11.871
one orbit, now he's
gone off the screen.

590
01:03:11.872 --> 01:03:13.739
That means he's coming down.

591
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.304
Yeah, but where?

592
01:03:15.305 --> 01:03:18.043
Some place in Russia.
It has to be.

593
01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.662
The British theory about
Japan is nonsense.

594
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.492
- Forget Japan.
- I agree.

595
01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:27.772
We've re-photographed
every square inch.

596
01:04:02.713 --> 01:04:05.716
Ventilator fans to full power.

597
01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.108
Open all air ducts.

598
01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:12.368
Area safe to enter. All
crews to stations.

599
01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:15.044
All air ducts to normal.

600
01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:17.908
Air ducts opened.

601
01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:20.325
- Close crater.
- Closing crater.

602
01:04:21.433 --> 01:04:24.008
Fire guards to station.

603
01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:25.861
(Japanese)

604
01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:38.597
Ventilator fans to
normal. Open shutters.

605
01:04:40.467 --> 01:04:42.310
Reception complete.

606
01:04:44.813 --> 01:04:46.842
Withdraw captive spaceship.

607
01:04:50.352 --> 01:04:52.388
Guards to stations.

608
01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:26.130
- Remove the prisoners.
- Remove the prisoners.

609
01:05:47.827 --> 01:05:50.615
I shall be in my apartment.

610
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:53.942
I may send for you later.

611
01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.542
(shouting in Japanese)

612
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:24.149
I must congratulate
you, gentlemen,

613
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:26.000
upon your superb equipment.

614
01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:29.068
We congratulate you, sir,
upon the way you handle it.

615
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:32.154
Our clients are satisfied
with the progress so far?

616
01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:34.256
My government is quite satisfied.

617
01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:35.257
Good.

618
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:36.270
Hans.

619
01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:45.209
You will see that my piranha
fish get very hungry.

620
01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:49.880
They can strip a man to
the bone in 30 seconds.

621
01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:05.502
I have decided to ask for a
little money in advance.

622
01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:09.758
I want the sum of 100 million
dollars in gold bullion...

623
01:07:09.788 --> 01:07:12.522
deposited in our account
in Buenos Aires.

624
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:15.489
Our agreement states quite clearly
that no money should be paid

625
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:19.198
until war is broken out between
Russia and the United States.

626
01:07:19.199 --> 01:07:22.413
- This is extortion.
- Extortion is my business.

627
01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:25.440
Go and think it over
gentlemen, I'm busy.

628
01:07:26.665 --> 01:07:30.003
Osato and Number 11, report now.

629
01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.155
An unknown Englishman was in
your office the other day.

630
01:07:48.156 --> 01:07:49.490
Correct, Number One.

631
01:07:49.876 --> 01:07:53.314
- Do you know what gun this is?
- Walther PPK.

632
01:07:54.034 --> 01:07:57.112
Only one person we know
uses this sort of gun.

633
01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:00.154
James Bond.

634
01:08:01.306 --> 01:08:04.413
- But Bond is dead.
- It was in all the newspapers.

635
01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:05.414
Rubbish.

636
01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.336
Bond is alive.

637
01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:10.544
Unless you killed him, Mr Osato?

638
01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:14.230
Don't tell me you let him go.

639
01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:18.427
I gave Number 11 the strictest
orders to eliminate him.

640
01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:21.844
- And did she?
- She failed.

641
01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:25.562
You should've killed him Osato,
you had plenty of opportunity.

642
01:08:25.563 --> 01:08:28.694
This organisation does
not tolerate failure.

643
01:08:28.699 --> 01:08:30.766
- I know, but you see I...
- Go.

644
01:08:33.974 --> 01:08:34.974
Well?

645
01:08:42.967 --> 01:08:44.101
Osato.

646
01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.216
Kill Bond, now.

647
01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.783
Yes number One, yes, yes.

648
01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:43.804
- Hello.
- Bad news from outer space.

649
01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:47.474
Yes, I heard it. Now the Russians
are accusing the Americans.

650
01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:48.941
Next time it will be war.

651
01:09:48.942 --> 01:09:51.331
We'll have to get down
to the volcanoes.

652
01:09:51.332 --> 01:09:52.332
I agree.

653
01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:55.664
We'll also need a company
of first-rate men.

654
01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.335
Do you have any commandos here?

655
01:09:58.336 --> 01:10:00.003
I have much, much better.

656
01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:03.501
Ninjas. Top-secret, Bond-San.

657
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:06.909
This is my ninja training school.

658
01:10:13.148 --> 01:10:14.148
Ninjas?

659
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:17.149
The art of concealment
and surprise, Bond-San.

660
01:10:52.477 --> 01:10:55.338
This must develop very
fast reflex actions.

661
01:10:55.339 --> 01:10:56.919
And spiritual strength.

662
01:11:29.888 --> 01:11:32.651
Now, we will see
some modern ninjas.

663
01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:37.730
My plan is this.

664
01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:41.151
I make a base on the
Ama island. 100

665
01:11:41.152 --> 01:11:43.420
of my ninjas will slide in unseen.

666
01:11:44.509 --> 01:11:46.595
They will be workers
and fishermen.

667
01:11:46.596 --> 01:11:48.196
- What about me?
- Later.

668
01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:52.182
But for the moment, these will
interest you, rocket guns.

669
01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:53.335
Very powerful.

670
01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:56.702
See the holes in the
back for jet propulsion.

671
01:12:00.208 --> 01:12:02.608
- It's a fine gun.
- All rocket guns.

672
01:12:04.432 --> 01:12:06.566
This is our special baby rocket.

673
01:12:07.494 --> 01:12:09.500
It's very useful for people who

674
01:12:09.501 --> 01:12:11.894
smoke too many
cigarettes like you.

675
01:12:18.741 --> 01:12:21.515
- Accurate up to 30 yards.
- Very neat.

676
01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.436
It can save your life,
this cigarette.

677
01:12:24.437 --> 01:12:26.444
You sound like a commercial.

678
01:12:26.445 --> 01:12:30.387
- Now, what's the plan for me?
- First, you become a Japanese.

679
01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:35.260
Second, you train hard and quickly
to become a ninja like us.

680
01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:38.773
And third, to give
you extra-special

681
01:12:38.774 --> 01:12:40.819
cover, you take a wife.

682
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:51.984
Regretfully impossible.

683
01:12:52.818 --> 01:12:56.485
You must marry Ama girl. One
who is known on the island.

684
01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:59.863
- Is she pretty?
- She has a face like a pig.

685
01:13:00.418 --> 01:13:03.352
- To hell with that idea.
- But this is duty.

686
01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:08.162
The girl I have chosen
is an agent of mine.

687
01:13:08.163 --> 01:13:10.571
But first, you must
become Japanese.

688
01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:12.971
(Japanese)

689
01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:18.776
- Eyepieces for Hera.
- Eyepieces for Hera.

690
01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.604
(Japanese)

691
01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:26.443
Why don't you just dye
the parts that show?

692
01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:28.653
(Japanese)

693
01:13:36.419 --> 01:13:39.164
- Konbanwa.
- Konbanha.

694
01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:50.813
Tiger said, from now on, you must
do everything in Japanese-style.

695
01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:52.511
Everything?

696
01:13:54.223 --> 01:13:55.327
Good for Tiger.

697
01:16:01.053 --> 01:16:02.053
I'm...

698
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:05.963
I...

699
01:16:06.967 --> 01:16:07.967
Aki.

700
01:16:07.968 --> 01:16:09.578
I'm...

701
01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:18.240
(Japanese)

702
01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:19.741
She's dead.

703
01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:22.994
Poisoned.

704
01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:29.808
Tiger, we must get to that island.

705
01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:33.619
You're almost ready. Just
two more days training.

706
01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:04.452
(Japanese)

707
01:17:14.183 --> 01:17:17.183
- You killed him.
- Yeah, he tried to kill me.

708
01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.954
This man is a stranger
from outside.

709
01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:26.755
It's lucky we're
getting out of here.

710
01:17:26.756 --> 01:17:29.263
Just tomorrow you'll be
a poor Japanese worker

711
01:17:29.264 --> 01:17:31.396
with humble Japanese
wife at your side.

712
01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.331
Yeah, with a face like a pig.

713
01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:09.712
My men are already ashore,
all over the island.

714
01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:13.646
We have four days left.
It is not much time.

715
01:21:14.662 --> 01:21:22.662
(Japanese)

716
01:22:16.651 --> 01:22:17.785
This is my house.

717
01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:22.403
My friend has made us some food.

718
01:22:25.733 --> 01:22:27.233
Do you live here alone?

719
01:22:27.234 --> 01:22:29.653
Yes, my parents are dead.

720
01:22:30.234 --> 01:22:31.368
Sit down, please.

721
01:22:35.123 --> 01:22:36.123
Oysters.

722
01:22:37.535 --> 01:22:40.135
- Is this the only room there is?
- Yes.

723
01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.754
That is your bed.

724
01:22:42.877 --> 01:22:44.599
I shall sleep over there.

725
01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:50.037
- We're supposed to be married.
- Think again, please.

726
01:22:50.153 --> 01:22:52.153
You gave false name to priest.

727
01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:53.363
Yes, but we must keep up

728
01:22:53.364 --> 01:22:55.178
appearances, we're
on our honeymoon.

729
01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:58.092
No honeymoon, this is business.

730
01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.482
I won't need these.

731
01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:36.911
- Bond-San.
- What's wrong?

732
01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:40.558
The Americans have changed
the launching date.

733
01:23:40.559 --> 01:23:42.100
The countdown has already started.

734
01:23:42.101 --> 01:23:43.846
The president has
spoken on TV he's

735
01:23:43.847 --> 01:23:45.687
given a last warning
to the Russians.

736
01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:48.606
- When does it go up?
- Tonight, midnight. Our time.

737
01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:50.350
Did your men search the island?

738
01:23:50.351 --> 01:23:52.622
Yes, there is nothing
except volcanoes.

739
01:23:52.623 --> 01:23:54.752
Everything is so
normal around here.

740
01:23:54.753 --> 01:23:56.989
- Nothing happens.
- One thing has happened.

741
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:59.834
Yesterday an Ama girl rowed
her boat into Ryuzaki.

742
01:23:59.835 --> 01:24:00.835
Ryuzaki?

743
01:24:00.836 --> 01:24:03.121
It is a big cave on the mainland.

744
01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:05.739
And when her boat
floated out again...

745
01:24:06.466 --> 01:24:07.588
she was dead.

746
01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:11.511
Was that the funeral
we saw yesterday?

747
01:24:11.512 --> 01:24:12.512
Yes.

748
01:24:12.513 --> 01:24:14.926
- How did she die?
- Nobody knows.

749
01:24:16.719 --> 01:24:18.928
- Can you take me to this cave?
- Yes.

750
01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:22.463
We'll slip away from the
fishing fleet in the morning.

751
01:25:03.054 --> 01:25:04.134
All right?

752
01:25:05.314 --> 01:25:06.983
Now, where is this cave?

753
01:25:07.895 --> 01:25:10.998
It's straight across.
The cave is over there.

754
01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:44.432
Gas, get over the side. Quick.

755
01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:11.581
Phosgene gas, to keep
the visitors away.

756
01:26:13.231 --> 01:26:15.698
You noticed the
sulphur on the walls?

757
01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.001
- The yellow?
- Yes.

758
01:26:17.256 --> 01:26:20.647
It was once an underground outlet
for the lava from the volcano.

759
01:26:20.648 --> 01:26:24.011
- There must be a long tunnel.
- Miles of it.

760
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.814
It leads all the way, right
up to the top there.

761
01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:30.851
That's where we'll have to go
next, you think you can make it?

762
01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:33.312
Of course. It's business.

763
01:26:33.465 --> 01:26:34.465
Good.

764
01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:56.309
- May I rest a moment?
- Surely.

765
01:27:00.966 --> 01:27:02.290
It's hard work.

766
01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:05.330
Some honeymoon.

767
01:27:34.374 --> 01:27:36.918
It's going down, into the volcano.

768
01:27:42.742 --> 01:27:45.116
Heliport to position.

769
01:27:46.843 --> 01:27:48.910
The honeymoon is over, come on.

770
01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:52.016
(announcements in Japanese)

771
01:28:25.342 --> 01:28:27.740
This volcano isn't active, is it?

772
01:28:27.741 --> 01:28:30.470
It never has been,
not in my lifetime.

773
01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:33.391
There's been some terrific
heat here recently.

774
01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:35.526
What happened to the helicopter?

775
01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.878
It's down there somewhere.

776
01:28:38.563 --> 01:28:39.563
Come on.

777
01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:44.554
Stand by. Mark.

778
01:28:44.903 --> 01:28:47.170
Stand by for ten-second countdown.

779
01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.672
10, 9, 8...

780
01:28:49.681 --> 01:28:52.451
All units through out the world
will remain in instant readiness

781
01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:54.370
so long as the
spacecraft is in orbit.

782
01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:57.238
3, 2, 1.

783
01:28:58.166 --> 01:28:59.438
Ignition.

784
01:29:11.407 --> 01:29:15.207
This is it, gentlemen. All we
can do now is wait and pray.

785
01:29:36.477 --> 01:29:39.144
- Is that deep?
- They usually are, very.

786
01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:47.333
It's metal, wait here.

787
01:30:02.537 --> 01:30:05.752
Heliport to take-off position.

788
01:30:12.324 --> 01:30:13.796

01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:40.893
Yes.

Roger, Jupiter.

803
01:33:00.575 --> 01:33:04.451
You're now four hours 36
minutes into the mission.

804
01:33:04.663 --> 01:33:07.197

You guys volunteer for
astronaut training?

811
01:34:15.595 --> 01:34:19.236
In our country, we say
cosmonaut. Yes, the both of us.

01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:25.440
Yes, been within six months
since we started training.

813

Good evening.

814
01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:30.651
Who the hell are you?

815
01:34:30.652 --> 01:34:33.431
Stand back, I'm going

They told me you were
assassinated in Hong Kong.

842
01:38:56.910 --> 01:38:58.845
Yes, this is my second life.

01:39:11.274 --> 01:39:14.586
As you see, I am about to
inaugurate a little war.

848
01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:17.124
In a matter of hours,
when America and

01:42:02.992 --> 01:42:04.326
(Japanese)

876
01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:36.618
Bird 1 to base, separation
complete. Confirm acquisition.

877
01:42:36.894 --> 01:42:39.860
Calling Bird 1, you
are 70 nautical

878
01:42:39.861 --> 01:42:42.909
miles downrange, 200
miles altitude.

879
01:42:42.939 --> 01:42:46.413
Hans, our job will soon be done.

880
01:42:46.828 --> 01:42:49.679
Blow them up as soon as they
have captured the Americans.

881
01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:53.592
Here is the key to operate
the exploder button.

882
01:42:53.622 --> 01:42:57.048
There are men in the
crater. Men in the crater.

883
01:42:58.297 --> 01:43:01.476
- Crater guns, fire.
- Crater guns, open fire.

884
01:43:23.616 --> 01:43:26.086
The firing power
inside my crater is

885
01:43:26.087 --> 01:43:28.422
enough to annihilate a small army.

886
01:43:29.196 --> 01:43:30.996
You can watch it all on TV.

887
01:43:31.747 --> 01:43:34.613
It's the last program
you're likely to see.

888
01:43:34.614 --> 01:43:38.881
Well, if I'm going to be forced
to watch television, may I smoke?

889
01:43:39.505 --> 01:43:41.439
Yes, give him his cigarettes.

890
01:43:41.634 --> 01:43:44.834
It won't be the nicotine
that kills you, Mr Bond.

891
01:44:03.045 --> 01:44:05.857
Armed guards to control room.

892
01:44:20.338 --> 01:44:22.589
- Close the crater.
- Close crater.

893
01:44:22.590 --> 01:44:26.657
I shall look forward personally
to exterminating you, Mr Bond.

894
01:45:24.235 --> 01:45:25.502
Close the shutters.

895
01:45:33.941 --> 01:45:35.475
We are now impregnable.

896
01:45:35.935 --> 01:45:38.399
Interception will
take place in eight

897
01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:40.669
minutes, nothing can prevent that.

898
01:47:09.173 --> 01:47:11.966
- Impregnable?
- (gives order in Japanese)

899
01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:13.421
Come with me, Mr Bond.

900
01:47:13.422 --> 01:47:15.457
Bird 1 to base. Locked on target.

901
01:47:15.458 --> 01:47:17.152
- Osato?
- Yes, Number One?

902
01:47:17.153 --> 01:47:18.903
76, confirm.

903
01:47:18.933 --> 01:47:20.680
Base calling Bird 1.

904
01:47:21.177 --> 01:47:24.844
You are to assume full control
of operation from now on.

905
01:47:25.377 --> 01:47:27.357
Seven minutes to interception.

906
01:47:27.358 --> 01:47:29.007
Roger, Base One.

907
01:47:30.132 --> 01:47:31.732
Houston, this is Hawaii.

908
01:47:31.862 --> 01:47:33.892
We have an unidentified
object on scope.

909
01:47:33.893 --> 01:47:36.227
Order first alert,
arm all weapons.

910
01:47:36.951 --> 01:47:39.551
Interception will
occur in six minutes.

911
01:47:46.085 --> 01:47:49.254
This is the price of
failure, Mr Bond.

912
01:47:55.251 --> 01:47:56.251
Come on.

913
01:48:07.648 --> 01:48:10.099
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

914
01:48:21.162 --> 01:48:22.625
There's an exploder
button up in the

915
01:48:22.626 --> 01:48:24.247
control room, we've
got to get up there.

916
01:48:24.248 --> 01:48:26.249
Impossible, too well defended.

917
01:48:33.129 --> 01:48:36.596
Evacuate the control.

918
01:48:52.610 --> 01:48:54.694
(shouting in Japanese)

919
01:48:56.447 --> 01:49:00.711
Control room technicians. There
must be another way up there.

920
01:49:12.164 --> 01:49:14.965
Give me cover till I
get to the staircase.

921
01:50:59.845 --> 01:51:01.240
Bon appetite.

922
01:51:17.374 --> 01:51:20.749
Closing fast on our
vehicle. Orbit identical.

923
01:51:20.996 --> 01:51:24.427
All units stand by for codeword.
Codeword is imminent.

924
01:51:24.428 --> 01:51:26.962
I repeat, closing
fast on our vehicle.

925
01:51:57.711 --> 01:52:02.249
Blown up, the enemy. I repeat,
the enemy is blown up.

926
01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:04.967
All units will return
to first alert.

927
01:52:04.968 --> 01:52:08.106
Codeword is not, I say
again, not imminent.

928
01:52:11.392 --> 01:52:12.397
Tiger...

929
01:52:14.068 --> 01:52:15.090
we've done it.

930
01:52:34.331 --> 01:52:35.830
Down the tunnel.

931
01:53:58.201 --> 01:53:59.201
Steady.

932
01:54:15.974 --> 01:54:18.473
Now, about that honeymoon.

933
01:54:19.645 --> 01:54:23.012
Why not? But they'll
never let you stay.

934
01:54:24.199 --> 01:54:26.088
But they'll never find us.

935
01:54:52.822 --> 01:54:54.356
Dinghy is on board, sir.

936
01:54:54.357 --> 01:54:56.597
Tell him to come below and report.

937
01:54:56.598 --> 01:54:58.926
It will be a pleasure, sir.
