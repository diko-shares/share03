2
00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:31.424
My name is
Tse Mei-Ying.

3
00:01:33.127 --> 00:01:34.829
But people call me Sister Tse.

4
00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.734
I never believed in
the American dream.

5
00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:43.470
All I knew was how to survive.

6
00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:13.100
I made a deal with a
snakehead from Taiwan.

7
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.605
Prostitution for
smuggling me to New York.

8
00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:30.017
I knew we could die, but
we all have our reasons.

9
00:02:44.098 --> 00:02:47.634
Get on the ground!

10
00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:03.610
At
approximately 4 a.m. today,

11
00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:06.213
a cargo boat with hundreds
of smuggled Chinese migrants

12
00:04:06.247 --> 00:04:10.084
was intercepted by the FBI
off of Rockaway Beach, Queens.

13
00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:13.087
Chinese human smugglers,
often known as snakeheads,

14
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.622
have shown a reckless
disregard for the health

15
00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:18.225
and safety of the
migrants being smuggled.

16
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:28.701
Fuck out of my face.

17
00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:29.636
Huh?

18
00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:30.905
Anybody else want a home run?

19
00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:31.771
Come on.

20
00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:35.376
Now you shut the fuck up.

21
00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:36.844
Welcome to America.

22
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.232
- Here you go, drink!
- Cheers!

23
00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.002
- Barbie.
- Let's go.

24
00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:09.270
Hey, come, sit.

25
00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:20.713
You wanna eat, you guys hungry?

26
00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:26.220
Maybe I went the
light way before.

27
00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:32.359
Hey you,
how much you owe?

28
00:06:37.298 --> 00:06:41.268
Drink, it'll
make you feel better.

29
00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:49.243
I owed $57,000
to the snakehead.

30
00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:51.946
All that mattered
was that I was here.

31
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.285
We all have our reasons.

32
00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:04.358
I came to America
to find my daughter.

33
00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:37.258
Put some makeup on.

34
00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:38.325
Time for work.

35
00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:51.272
Hi.

36
00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:53.474
My name is Steve, Steven.

37
00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:56.010
What's your name?

38
00:08:23.604 --> 00:08:25.339
Bitch, you bit me!

39
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.078
Fuck!

40
00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:32.279
The fuck is going on?

41
00:10:57.724 --> 00:10:59.693
Kill the bitch, Dai Mah!

42
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:04.064
She tried to kill me!

43
00:11:04.097 --> 00:11:06.366
What would you do if
somebody fucked you up?

44
00:11:22.382 --> 00:11:24.351
Everyone has to
work and earn here.

45
00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:28.255
I can work, I can earn.

46
00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:29.323
Just give me a chance.

47
00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.024
I just gave you a chance.

48
00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:36.997
That kind of work
is for the weak.

49
00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:38.532
I'm not weak.

50
00:11:38.565 --> 00:11:41.001
Ah, so you think I'm unfair?

51
00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:44.271
No.

52
00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.406
There are rules.

53
00:11:47.774 --> 00:11:51.078
Chinatown doesn't
change for anyone.

54
00:11:56.316 --> 00:11:57.117
Come on.

55
00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:08.395
This is Hong.

56
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.798
He came here for the
same reasons you did.

57
00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:19.473
But he betrayed me, my family,

58
00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:22.109
and you.

59
00:12:24.645 --> 00:12:26.814
He set up the FBI ship raid.

60
00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:36.156
So Sister Tse, what would you do

61
00:12:37.224 --> 00:12:38.826
if someone betrayed your family?

62
00:14:32.305 --> 00:14:34.608
I didn't always
make the right choice,

63
00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:36.677
but I always survived.

64
00:14:46.353 --> 00:14:49.322
After I got caught, went
to jail for eight years.

65
00:14:52.894 --> 00:14:56.530
They took my daughter away, and
she was adopted in New York.

66
00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:02.436
When I got out, I
vowed to find her.

67
00:15:39.573 --> 00:15:40.407
Hey.

68
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.445
Uh, no.

69
00:15:45.479 --> 00:15:46.948
Come on, let me show you.

70
00:15:46.981 --> 00:15:48.415
At first...

71
00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:49.683
Get the
right amount of meat.

72
00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:51.384
I didn't trust Zareeb.

73
00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:52.820
Water here.

74
00:15:52.854 --> 00:15:54.321
Helps it stick, you know?

75
00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:57.691
- But in the end...
- Fold it over, pinch.

76
00:15:57.724 --> 00:15:59.626
He was my only friend.

77
00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:00.962
Voila.

78
00:16:00.995 --> 00:16:01.829
You try.

79
00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:04.065
We were the same.

80
00:16:04.098 --> 00:16:07.367
You know, America
is tough, but look,

81
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.335
at least we have jobs here.

82
00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:11.939
We both depended
on Dai Mah to survive.

83
00:16:11.973 --> 00:16:13.573
Might need a
lot more practice.

84
00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.276
You'll get it, you're smart.

85
00:16:24.886 --> 00:16:27.287
You from Fuzhou or Guangdong?

86
00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:31.408
Where are you from?

87
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:35.796
You speak Chinese?

88
00:16:36.622 --> 00:16:37.581
Just a little.

89
00:16:38.207 --> 00:16:39.416
But my French is much better.

90
00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:44.437
Look.

91
00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:46.974
My wife come here soon.

92
00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:50.744
Then I'm going to open
my own restaurant,

93
00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:52.512
Zareeb's Famous Dumplings.

94
00:16:54.748 --> 00:16:56.083
You have a family here?

95
00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:02.756
Get back to work.

96
00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:03.790
Come on, Dai Mah.

97
00:17:03.825 --> 00:17:06.060
We got labor laws, I get breaks.

98
00:17:09.396 --> 00:17:11.331
Hey, you hear boss
lady, let's go.

99
00:17:12.432 --> 00:17:13.733
No, you stay.

100
00:17:15.903 --> 00:17:17.839
I've got some other
jobs that pay more.

101
00:17:19.106 --> 00:17:20.340
How much?

102
00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:40.393
What'd you bring me?

103
00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:48.936
Zareeb really does
make good dumplings.

104
00:17:51.973 --> 00:17:53.841
Can I trust you with money?

105
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.410
I need a new collector.

106
00:18:00.014 --> 00:18:02.817
My clients respond better
to women than Pai Gwut.

107
00:18:04.852 --> 00:18:06.020
What's in it for me?

108
00:18:07.154 --> 00:18:10.724
Give you a list, you collect.

109
00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:14.728
I take $200 out each
month of what you owe.

110
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.763
If they don't pay?

111
00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:19.499
They will.

112
00:18:25.907 --> 00:18:26.706
Feeling lucky?

113
00:18:30.144 --> 00:18:31.411
Well here's your tip.

114
00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:01.969
You should use the ones
with the copper coating.

115
00:20:02.003 --> 00:20:05.172
To round the corners,
a dead giveaway.

116
00:20:22.689 --> 00:20:24.258
There is a saying
where I'm from.

117
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.163
When drinking water,
remember the source.

118
00:20:30.764 --> 00:20:32.632
I knew why I was here.

119
00:21:13.407 --> 00:21:16.177
Four months I couldn't find her,

120
00:21:17.178 --> 00:21:20.047
and then one day, there she was.

121
00:21:31.158 --> 00:21:33.693
Every Sunday I
followed her to church.

122
00:21:36.964 --> 00:21:40.101
Even after eight years, a
mother knows her daughter.

123
00:22:07.027 --> 00:22:08.095
My search was over.

124
00:22:09.163 --> 00:22:11.031
But I didn't know
what to do next.

125
00:22:28.349 --> 00:22:30.317
Dai Mah's smuggling
empire kept the peace

126
00:22:30.351 --> 00:22:32.920
in a dying Chinatown underworld.

127
00:22:32.953 --> 00:22:35.256
Import-export
companies, truck drivers

128
00:22:35.289 --> 00:22:38.259
and employment agencies
all depended on her.

129
00:22:38.292 --> 00:22:40.727
For them, smuggling
was harmless.

130
00:22:41.896 --> 00:22:43.264
But everyone knew
this wouldn't last.

131
00:22:44.465 --> 00:22:46.367
If they kept quiet,
they got to eat.

132
00:22:47.401 --> 00:22:49.136
Even Rambo's girlfriend Sinh

133
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.071
got closer to the
operation every day.

134
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.275
Pai Gwut remained loyal.

135
00:22:57.278 --> 00:22:58.846
And no matter how mad he got,

136
00:22:58.879 --> 00:23:00.014
no wrong respect Rambo.

137
00:23:03.284 --> 00:23:04.784
Everyone knew who fed them.

138
00:23:08.889 --> 00:23:10.291
Alright, y'all
better put your hands,

139
00:23:10.324 --> 00:23:11.992
put your motherfucking hands up!

140
00:23:15.829 --> 00:23:17.831
Shut up!

141
00:23:18.866 --> 00:23:19.699
Shut up!

142
00:23:21.902 --> 00:23:24.737
Thank you for coming.

143
00:23:26.173 --> 00:23:29.043
My first birthday party
I've ever had in my life.

144
00:23:30.411 --> 00:23:32.112
I hate all of you fuckers!

145
00:23:32.146 --> 00:23:35.115
Not one of you visited
me when I was locked up!

146
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:36.116
So fuck you!

147
00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:43.924
I wanna dedicate this
evening to the one woman

148
00:23:45.292 --> 00:23:46.894
that means everything to me.

149
00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:50.231
I love you, Ma.

150
00:23:50.264 --> 00:23:53.334
That's my mom!

151
00:23:56.904 --> 00:23:58.505
I'm gonna sing you a song, Ma.

152
00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:00.207
what the fuck,

153
00:24:00.241 --> 00:24:01.542
- you think you can touch me?
- What the fuck?

154
00:24:01.575 --> 00:24:03.043
- You don't get to touch her!
- What the fuck?

155
00:24:03.077 --> 00:24:04.311
Big bro, big bro!

156
00:24:04.345 --> 00:24:06.447
No, no, chill, big bro!

157
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.780
Chill, big bro!

158
00:24:07.815 --> 00:24:08.949
Big bro, chill, chill!

159
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.891
Your soba better.

160
00:24:18.592 --> 00:24:19.493
Let me help.

161
00:24:19.526 --> 00:24:21.095
No, I don't need help.

162
00:24:21.128 --> 00:24:23.831
Come on, Sister Tse,
everybody needs help sometime.

163
00:24:25.099 --> 00:24:27.034
How long have you
been working for them?

164
00:24:27.067 --> 00:24:28.869
About
three years now.

165
00:24:28.902 --> 00:24:30.537
I was here before Rambo got out.

166
00:24:34.108 --> 00:24:35.409
What did he do?

167
00:24:35.442 --> 00:24:36.343
You didn't hear?

168
00:24:38.078 --> 00:24:39.413
His father was a drunk.

169
00:24:39.446 --> 00:24:42.583
Used to come home and
beat Dai Mah every day.

170
00:24:42.616 --> 00:24:45.185
One day Rambo grew
up, killed him.

171
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.922
Killed him?

172
00:24:50.324 --> 00:24:51.425
The rest of the family's fine.

173
00:24:51.458 --> 00:24:53.427
He's got a brother
on Wall Street.

174
00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.429
Rambo's just the
black sheep, you know?

175
00:24:56.463 --> 00:24:58.065
So how much do you owe them?

176
00:24:59.166 --> 00:25:01.302
53,200.

177
00:25:01.335 --> 00:25:03.203
Wow!

178
00:25:03.237 --> 00:25:05.939
So when you were dreaming
of coming to America,

179
00:25:05.973 --> 00:25:07.908
did you think it was
gonna be this way?

180
00:25:09.643 --> 00:25:11.578
I didn't think, I just came.

181
00:25:27.961 --> 00:25:28.962
Hey yo.

182
00:25:29.296 --> 00:25:31.098
Feed the pair fish with this,

183
00:25:31.131 --> 00:25:33.200
and then wipe down
all the condensation.

184
00:25:33.233 --> 00:25:35.402
Our friends don't
like condensation.

185
00:25:37.338 --> 00:25:39.173
Hey, I know Ma wants
us to work together,

186
00:25:40.341 --> 00:25:42.276
so as long as you
listen to me...

187
00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:43.143
Fuck!

188
00:25:44.311 --> 00:25:45.346
Damn it.

189
00:25:58.559 --> 00:25:59.560
Hey babe.

190
00:25:59.593 --> 00:26:01.195
Sup baby.

191
00:26:01.228 --> 00:26:02.529
What's going on?

192
00:26:03.697 --> 00:26:06.033
So can you tell
me why she's here?

193
00:26:08.268 --> 00:26:10.003
I just needed some help.

194
00:26:10.037 --> 00:26:11.038
She needs the money.

195
00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:15.409
Ma says she wants
her here anyway.

196
00:26:16.677 --> 00:26:17.478
Really?

197
00:26:19.346 --> 00:26:21.582
You see, this is
exactly what I mean.

198
00:26:21.615 --> 00:26:23.417
Fuck you talking about, huh?

199
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.352
You know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

200
00:26:27.254 --> 00:26:28.322
You should be a man.

201
00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:32.359
Well you should
shut the fuck up.

202
00:26:34.995 --> 00:26:37.598
I ain't got time for this
bullshit today, all right?

203
00:26:39.233 --> 00:26:40.534
This ain't fucking bullshit.

204
00:26:45.005 --> 00:26:47.341
Fuck you!

205
00:26:48.342 --> 00:26:50.077
The fuck you looking
at, ding dong?

206
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.944
Huh?

207
00:27:07.327 --> 00:27:09.129
Golden Taxi, yeah.

208
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:12.566
Yeah, getting better?

209
00:27:12.599 --> 00:27:14.067
Good, good.

210
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:15.569
Where do you need to go?

211
00:27:15.602 --> 00:27:17.404
All right, no problem.

212
00:27:17.438 --> 00:27:18.705
Five minutes?

213
00:27:18.739 --> 00:27:20.207
Yeah.

214
00:27:22.476 --> 00:27:23.343
Let's go.

215
00:27:25.012 --> 00:27:26.980
Are you not gonna get that?

216
00:27:27.014 --> 00:27:28.715
I like to hear it ring.

217
00:27:28.749 --> 00:27:30.317
It's the sound of making money.

218
00:27:37.357 --> 00:27:38.659
People love Dai Mah.

219
00:27:38.692 --> 00:27:41.094
For a price, she brought
their family here.

220
00:27:42.329 --> 00:27:43.430
- Hey.
- Hey.

221
00:27:43.464 --> 00:27:45.432
Oh, oh, ah.

222
00:27:51.205 --> 00:27:53.373
But Dai Mah loved
money more than people.

223
00:27:55.309 --> 00:27:57.144
Everyone knew where she was,

224
00:27:57.177 --> 00:28:00.080
because all roads through
Chinatown flow through Dai Mah.

225
00:28:19.233 --> 00:28:20.334
Everyone knows you.

226
00:28:21.735 --> 00:28:23.136
Yeah.

227
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.339
They know me and
they know my family.

228
00:28:25.372 --> 00:28:26.206
They trust me.

229
00:28:27.608 --> 00:28:29.676
They're afraid
of you and Rambo.

230
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.345
Afraid?

231
00:28:31.378 --> 00:28:34.114
There's a difference
between fear and respect.

232
00:28:35.215 --> 00:28:36.383
Everybody loves Rambo.

233
00:28:38.318 --> 00:28:39.253
Whatever you say.

234
00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:47.628
You know your firstborn
is always special.

235
00:28:49.864 --> 00:28:51.598
I love all my sons, but

236
00:28:53.333 --> 00:28:55.369
when Rambo was a little
boy, he saved me.

237
00:28:57.204 --> 00:28:58.238
What'd he do?

238
00:29:00.407 --> 00:29:03.310
I was weak, he was strong.

239
00:29:06.313 --> 00:29:07.815
Went to jail when he was 12.

240
00:29:10.784 --> 00:29:12.820
He's spent more than
half his life there.

241
00:29:14.388 --> 00:29:18.225
What Rambo is
today, I'm to blame.

242
00:29:22.663 --> 00:29:25.332
You know what it's
like to be a mother.

243
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:32.439
You see your faults
in your children.

244
00:29:32.472 --> 00:29:34.441
You just wish you
had done better.

245
00:30:06.273 --> 00:30:08.308
She really likes you.

246
00:30:11.778 --> 00:30:14.481
You think you're
special, don't you, hm?

247
00:30:15.415 --> 00:30:16.416
You're not.

248
00:30:17.451 --> 00:30:18.685
I need to get back.

249
00:30:18.719 --> 00:30:20.320
Your mother hates
it when I'm late.

250
00:30:21.455 --> 00:30:24.758
You're just my mom's little
errand rat, you understand?

251
00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:25.592
Huh?

252
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:39.439
Told Ma she's too easy on you.

253
00:30:41.208 --> 00:30:42.409
Lucky I'm not in charge yet.

254
00:31:32.492 --> 00:31:33.326
Ready?

255
00:31:34.227 --> 00:31:36.263
If I wanted
to clear my debt,

256
00:31:36.296 --> 00:31:38.632
I had to find a
place in her family.

257
00:31:38.665 --> 00:31:40.400
They each get one.

258
00:31:41.768 --> 00:31:43.537
What's
she doing here?

259
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.239
She's gonna
deliver the food from now on.

260
00:31:46.273 --> 00:31:46.874
Trust her?

261
00:31:48.742 --> 00:31:50.011
All right, all right, Ma, sorry.

262
00:31:50.044 --> 00:31:51.913
I got it, I got it.

263
00:31:51.946 --> 00:31:53.246
I got it, Ma.

264
00:31:54.681 --> 00:31:56.349
There were
three safe houses.

265
00:31:56.383 --> 00:31:59.553
Each one had 10 to 20
migrants awaiting release.

266
00:32:00.721 --> 00:32:03.891
When a friend or relative
came to pay, they were free.

267
00:32:09.696 --> 00:32:12.299
There was always a lot of
cash at Eldridge House.

268
00:32:16.336 --> 00:32:18.605
The black Arowanas are a
little bit more aggressive

269
00:32:18.638 --> 00:32:21.708
than the silver ones
because they like the PH

270
00:32:21.742 --> 00:32:23.310
more on the acidic side.

271
00:32:23.343 --> 00:32:26.346
But if you put some peat
moss in the filter...

272
00:32:43.563 --> 00:32:46.433
I got some cousins in
Philly that might like you.

273
00:32:50.004 --> 00:32:50.838
Hey.

274
00:32:59.479 --> 00:33:00.982
I've seen how you stare.

275
00:33:02.817 --> 00:33:03.985
Seen it all my life.

276
00:33:05.452 --> 00:33:06.720
You think I'm weak, don't you?

277
00:33:11.893 --> 00:33:13.593
You survive your way,

278
00:33:15.863 --> 00:33:17.031
and I survive mine.

279
00:33:18.698 --> 00:33:21.368
In the end, it's all the same.

280
00:34:17.124 --> 00:34:18.725
Hey big bro.

281
00:34:18.758 --> 00:34:19.927
Where my slice at?

282
00:35:03.937 --> 00:35:04.438
Please...

283
00:35:04.738 --> 00:35:05.739
Can I have a coke?

284
00:35:06.773 --> 00:35:07.607
You want one?

285
00:35:09.043 --> 00:35:10.477
- Two.
- Three.

286
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:12.702
No, you
get a Diet Coke.

287
00:35:12.738 --> 00:35:13.739
Fat Boy.

288
00:35:14.614 --> 00:35:15.649
I hate Diet Coke.

289
00:35:15.682 --> 00:35:19.053
Hey, I lost two girls
to Fathead in Los Angeles.

290
00:35:19.086 --> 00:35:20.720
Think I can get
another shipment soon?

291
00:35:20.754 --> 00:35:22.890
Don't worry about it,
we'll take care of it.

292
00:35:22.924 --> 00:35:26.961
You know I can't earn
if I ain't got no product.

293
00:35:28.062 --> 00:35:29.729
- Piece of shit.
- Hey.

294
00:35:29.763 --> 00:35:31.665
When we eat, we eat in peace.

295
00:35:31.698 --> 00:35:34.035
Tse-jia, what you
doing this weekend?

296
00:35:35.836 --> 00:35:37.838
- Are you serious?
- What?

297
00:35:39.556 --> 00:35:41.266
You would crush her, Fat Boy.

298
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.844
Ma.

299
00:35:53.287 --> 00:35:54.121
Go ahead.

300
00:35:57.291 --> 00:35:58.125
You earned it.

301
00:36:08.803 --> 00:36:10.137
Smoking
in my restaurant?

302
00:36:10.171 --> 00:36:11.538
Nah.

303
00:36:34.594 --> 00:36:35.495
Yo Jack!

304
00:36:37.131 --> 00:36:38.665
Who are we meeting here?

305
00:36:38.698 --> 00:36:41.035
Hey, your
place is not to ask,

306
00:36:41.068 --> 00:36:43.703
your place is to follow, okay?

307
00:36:48.142 --> 00:36:51.778
Dai Mah was so rich
that Rambo never had to work,

308
00:36:51.812 --> 00:36:54.148
but he was a man, and
after 20 years in jail,

309
00:36:54.181 --> 00:36:55.782
he still had to prove it.

310
00:36:59.987 --> 00:37:01.155
My man Rambo.

311
00:37:02.223 --> 00:37:03.858
- And you are?
- Oh, she's the help,

312
00:37:03.891 --> 00:37:05.725
don't fuck with her.

313
00:37:05.759 --> 00:37:06.894
We good?

314
00:37:06.927 --> 00:37:09.063
Got that red Arowana special.

315
00:37:10.264 --> 00:37:12.333
That's what I'm talking about.

316
00:37:12.366 --> 00:37:13.600
What do you say, huh?

317
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:16.703
You up?

318
00:37:23.944 --> 00:37:25.179
All right, every
three to four weeks

319
00:37:25.212 --> 00:37:27.348
you're gonna pick up
20 cases from Jack.

320
00:37:27.381 --> 00:37:30.117
Five boxes go to the
safe house on Eldridge,

321
00:37:30.151 --> 00:37:32.619
three in Flushing, and
the rest to Richie.

322
00:37:32.652 --> 00:37:33.320
It's easy money.

323
00:37:35.222 --> 00:37:36.756
Hey, where you going?

324
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:38.325
You better get one
of those boxes!

325
00:37:41.228 --> 00:37:43.797
Am I gonna have some
problem with you?

326
00:37:43.831 --> 00:37:45.698
This is stupid,
I'm not doing that.

327
00:37:47.168 --> 00:37:48.701
I'm not gonna smuggle drugs.

328
00:37:50.805 --> 00:37:52.306
The people are better, hm?

329
00:37:53.407 --> 00:37:55.810
At least I give people hope.

330
00:37:55.843 --> 00:37:57.178
You kill them.

331
00:38:28.675 --> 00:38:31.879
When I clear my debt,
I will go to her.

332
00:38:35.916 --> 00:38:39.086
But it felt like
I'd never get there.

333
00:38:48.262 --> 00:38:51.798
Even though I was close,
I was nothing to her.

334
00:39:15.956 --> 00:39:17.657
Zareeb, forgot the rice.

335
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:20.161
Can you get it?

336
00:39:20.194 --> 00:39:21.228
Thanks.

337
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.751
Can you help me?

338
00:39:35.792 --> 00:39:37.211
I need to get in touch with my cousin.

339
00:39:38.003 --> 00:39:39.171
Do they have the money?

340
00:39:39.213 --> 00:39:41.548
They are trying to get the loan.

341
00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:42.966
Here. Call now.

342
00:39:43.008 --> 00:39:44.009
Thank you.

343
00:39:51.192 --> 00:39:52.092
- They shot Jin.
- Who?

344
00:39:52.126 --> 00:39:53.227
- Get the guns!
- Who?

345
00:40:15.015 --> 00:40:18.819
You survive your
way, and I survive mine.

346
00:40:19.954 --> 00:40:22.056
In the end, it's all the same.

347
00:40:23.524 --> 00:40:25.226
Hurry the fuck up,
go to the other room!

348
00:40:25.259 --> 00:40:26.961
Hurry up, hurry the fuck up!

349
00:40:27.995 --> 00:40:28.629
Hurry up!

350
00:40:30.164 --> 00:40:30.998
Where's the money at?

351
00:40:31.031 --> 00:40:33.133
Where the
fucking money at?

352
00:40:33.167 --> 00:40:34.835
Where's the fucking money?

353
00:41:22.583 --> 00:41:23.951
You okay?

354
00:41:25.286 --> 00:41:26.186
I'm okay.

355
00:41:37.998 --> 00:41:39.166
How?

356
00:41:40.868 --> 00:41:41.568
Too loud.

357
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:11.365
Chopsticks.

358
00:42:19.306 --> 00:42:20.307
Mm, watch.

359
00:43:10.357 --> 00:43:11.358
Get rid of it.

360
00:43:13.193 --> 00:43:14.628
B.B.'s dead.

361
00:43:14.661 --> 00:43:15.864
He was in the next run.

362
00:43:15.896 --> 00:43:19.333
We need another
snakehead for the Taiwan job.

363
00:43:21.001 --> 00:43:21.602
I'll go.

364
00:43:25.639 --> 00:43:26.473
You're crazy.

365
00:43:28.475 --> 00:43:30.344
Why do you wanna go?

366
00:43:30.377 --> 00:43:33.247
Do you think I want to
fold dumplings forever?

367
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.349
I've done it once,
I can do it again.

368
00:43:40.287 --> 00:43:41.622
Ma, she's not family.

369
00:43:54.201 --> 00:43:56.403
If I go, she'll
cut my debt in half.

370
00:43:58.205 --> 00:44:00.140
You know they don't
really care about you.

371
00:44:00.174 --> 00:44:01.575
To them you're just like a cook.

372
00:44:01.608 --> 00:44:04.311
You cook bad, they'll hire
somebody else to do it.

373
00:44:05.746 --> 00:44:08.348
If you know a fast way
how to make money, show me.

374
00:44:09.616 --> 00:44:11.718
But is it worth the risk?

375
00:44:11.752 --> 00:44:14.321
Every day we're
here, we're at risk.

376
00:44:14.354 --> 00:44:17.057
We could go to jail,
we could get deported.

377
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.626
We could get killed
and no one would know.

378
00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.296
So you tell me, is
it worth the risk?

379
00:46:30.223 --> 00:46:30.858
Hey.

380
00:46:32.726 --> 00:46:34.829
So you are the
snakehead from New York.

381
00:46:47.015 --> 00:46:48.225
Where's my cargo?

382
00:46:50.435 --> 00:46:51.603
What's the rush?

383
00:46:51.645 --> 00:46:53.188
You are a long way from home.

384
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:54.439
Have a drink.

385
00:46:56.859 --> 00:46:58.986
I'm here to do a job.

386
00:46:59.027 --> 00:47:03.991
I miss New York. How's
Dai Mah? Paigwut?

387
00:47:04.032 --> 00:47:06.201
Is Rambo out of jail yet?

388
00:47:06.243 --> 00:47:08.954
He must be all grown up.

389
00:47:10.455 --> 00:47:15.043
There's a typhoon coming
and we need to leave.

390
00:47:15.878 --> 00:47:17.087
Where are my people?

391
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:40.068
They all paid and are ready to go.

392
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:42.863
Hey! When are we leaving?

393
00:47:42.905 --> 00:47:44.865
We've been here for over three months!

394
00:47:44.907 --> 00:47:45.866
Shut up!

395
00:47:47.075 --> 00:47:48.035
Why do you talk so much?

396
00:47:48.076 --> 00:47:49.494
Whatever I tell you
to do, you do.

397
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.042
The ports will shut down
the ports tomorrow.

398
00:47:55.083 --> 00:47:56.877
You can't afford to keep them
here another month.

399
00:47:58.921 --> 00:48:00.130
Don't you think I know that?

400
00:48:03.091 --> 00:48:04.676
No. We leave tonight.

401
00:48:04.718 --> 00:48:05.719
How?

402
00:48:09.097 --> 00:48:11.058
If you follow me, I will
deliver you safe.

403
00:48:33.747 --> 00:48:38.544
From here, we take a container boat
from Taishan to Guatemala.

404
00:48:40.128 --> 00:48:43.757
There, a Coyote will smuggle
us north to America.

405
00:48:46.927 --> 00:48:51.932
Watch out for Cartel and Militia.
They own the border.

406
00:49:32.874 --> 00:49:34.674
Is that border patrol?

407
00:49:34.708 --> 00:49:37.410
I don't know, but
it's time to run.

408
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.415
- Vamanos!
- Come on!

409
00:49:42.449 --> 00:49:43.084
Come on!

410
00:49:45.052 --> 00:49:47.955
Eagle one here, I've
located about 20 illegals.

411
00:49:47.989 --> 00:49:49.924
They see the drone
and heading north.

412
00:49:49.957 --> 00:49:51.691
Can you handle them at
the river, Scorpion?

413
00:49:51.725 --> 00:49:53.828
In my vehicle,
you can just guide me in.

414
00:49:53.861 --> 00:49:55.629
Look at them
all scatter like ants.

415
00:50:07.842 --> 00:50:10.077
Looks like they close
the doors into an old barn.

416
00:50:10.111 --> 00:50:12.312
Copy
that, ETA five minutes.

417
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.487
Is this illegal shit?

418
00:50:21.155 --> 00:50:21.989
Money.

419
00:50:30.932 --> 00:50:32.834
Time to go.

420
00:50:36.469 --> 00:50:38.605
Group is
moving, group is moving.

421
00:50:44.678 --> 00:50:45.779
Go, go, go!

422
00:50:45.813 --> 00:50:46.981
I see it to the right!

423
00:50:48.715 --> 00:50:50.483
Watch right there, go!

424
00:50:50.517 --> 00:50:51.919
Go faster!

425
00:50:51.953 --> 00:50:53.353
I see
them, I see them.

426
00:50:59.927 --> 00:51:01.361
It's militia.

427
00:51:04.932 --> 00:51:06.466
They're
gonna hit the riverbed.

428
00:51:10.204 --> 00:51:11.638
We gonna get them this time.

429
00:51:11.671 --> 00:51:13.773
Patriots Defense Recon, go!

430
00:51:13.808 --> 00:51:14.876
Drone needs charge.

431
00:51:17.611 --> 00:51:20.780
Copy that, Scorpion
engaging target.

432
00:51:21.816 --> 00:51:22.917
Easy, hands up.

433
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:24.085
Get your fucking hands up.

434
00:51:25.485 --> 00:51:26.954
What is this?

435
00:51:26.988 --> 00:51:29.190
Fucking chink and a wetback?

436
00:51:29.223 --> 00:51:31.691
This some kind of
United Nations bullshit?

437
00:51:31.725 --> 00:51:33.828
We are Christian.

438
00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:35.428
Doesn't fucking matter,
get on the ground.

439
00:51:35.462 --> 00:51:37.064
Get on the fucking grown now!

440
00:51:37.098 --> 00:51:38.132
All the way!

441
00:51:39.666 --> 00:51:41.468
Open the fucking door.

442
00:51:41.501 --> 00:51:42.702
You fucking open the...

443
00:51:43.737 --> 00:51:45.538
Don't you talk
back, head down.

444
00:51:45.572 --> 00:51:48.541
Head down, don't look at me.

445
00:51:56.516 --> 00:51:57.517
Where's everyone?

446
00:51:58.585 --> 00:52:00.487
Where the fuck is everyone else?

447
00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.655
They went back.

448
00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:04.859
Scorpion, do you copy?

449
00:52:04.892 --> 00:52:05.960
We got nothing here.

450
00:52:07.094 --> 00:52:08.461
There's no one else.

451
00:52:17.171 --> 00:52:18.538
Scorpion.

452
00:52:21.175 --> 00:52:22.143
What's going on down there?

453
00:53:35.016 --> 00:53:36.549
Why did you come here?

454
00:53:48.695 --> 00:53:50.231
Ah, family.

455
00:53:53.633 --> 00:53:55.735
They never talk about family.

456
00:54:01.175 --> 00:54:02.709
I don't have family.

457
00:54:08.282 --> 00:54:10.284
You
always have family.

458
00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.497
Sister Tse.

459
00:54:49.689 --> 00:54:50.690
Hold on again.

460
00:54:51.791 --> 00:54:53.094
Hello?

461
00:54:53.127 --> 00:54:55.329
Oh, Zareeb, I think
it's your cousin.

462
00:54:56.831 --> 00:54:57.832
Hello?

463
00:54:58.298 --> 00:54:59.925
Amir, it's you! How are you doing?

464
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:05.514
Thank God, thank God!
God is great! Wonderful!

465
00:55:06.139 --> 00:55:07.766
Thank you very much!
Thank you!

466
00:55:08.308 --> 00:55:12.729
She got the visa! She is finally coming!
Tse, she is coming!

467
00:55:12.947 --> 00:55:14.381
I'm happy for you.

468
00:55:14.415 --> 00:55:15.648
Yeah!

469
00:55:17.451 --> 00:55:18.618
Come.

470
00:55:22.948 --> 00:55:26.285
Sister Tse, I know this
payment isn't enough.

471
00:55:26.326 --> 00:55:27.536
My daughter's been sick.

472
00:55:27.953 --> 00:55:29.705
I promise I won't run.

473
00:55:29.746 --> 00:55:30.956
Can you give me more time?

474
00:55:32.799 --> 00:55:34.801
Pay when you can,
you're not going anywhere.

475
00:55:35.961 --> 00:55:37.963
Thank you, Sister Tse.
Thank you! Thank you!

476
00:55:42.968 --> 00:55:44.720
Do you like lobsters?

477
00:55:44.761 --> 00:55:46.513
Come to my place.
I'll take care of you.

478
00:55:46.555 --> 00:55:47.556
Thank you.

479
00:56:04.031 --> 00:56:05.166
No, why?

480
00:56:05.199 --> 00:56:07.368
They wanna
know how you're doing there.

481
00:56:07.401 --> 00:56:09.736
I don't
wanna be on it.

482
00:56:09.769 --> 00:56:11.338
Then I told them just
because we live in Chinatown

483
00:56:11.372 --> 00:56:13.440
doesn't mean we
should burn our trash.

484
00:56:13.474 --> 00:56:15.876
Stop
being such a gentrifier.

485
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:18.412
Yeah, stop being a gentrifier.

486
00:56:23.417 --> 00:56:25.386
They wanna talk to Rosie too.

487
00:56:25.419 --> 00:56:27.321
It'll be good exposure
for my clients.

488
00:56:28.822 --> 00:56:31.025
Oh shoot, I forgot the brie.

489
00:56:31.058 --> 00:56:32.226
Gotta go back.

490
00:56:59.628 --> 00:57:03.590
Sister Tse! Lots of lobsters!

491
00:57:03.632 --> 00:57:05.634
Come up!
Come up!

492
00:57:11.473 --> 00:57:13.308
Sister Tse! Sister Tse!

493
00:57:14.059 --> 00:57:16.937
Here's a large box of lobsters for you.

494
00:57:17.855 --> 00:57:20.065
Also, these guys I trust.

495
00:57:20.858 --> 00:57:23.944
If you need help with anything,
don't be afraid to ask.

496
00:57:25.279 --> 00:57:26.280
Thank you.

497
00:57:31.318 --> 00:57:32.219
Hey, hey!

498
00:57:36.665 --> 00:57:39.251
You work for Dai Mah, right?

499
00:57:40.294 --> 00:57:44.673
I need help getting my wife
and daughter here.

500
00:57:45.674 --> 00:57:47.259
You should talk to Dai Mah.

501
00:57:47.301 --> 00:57:49.636
I don't trust Dai Mah.

502
00:57:49.678 --> 00:57:52.556
People are just cargo to her.

503
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:57.728
This is my wife and child.

504
00:58:01.106 --> 00:58:04.568
I can help you, but Dai Mah can't know.

505
00:58:05.694 --> 00:58:06.695
Thank you.

506
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:19.133
Hey yo, let
me ask you a question.

507
00:58:19.166 --> 00:58:19.967
Sup, Bo?

508
00:58:24.338 --> 00:58:26.273
What do you
think about Sister Tse?

509
00:58:30.978 --> 00:58:33.047
Uh, I don't know.

510
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:33.881
She's cool.

511
00:58:36.617 --> 00:58:38.619
Why, you like her?

512
00:58:38.652 --> 00:58:39.553
Nah.

513
00:58:39.586 --> 00:58:42.156
I want you to follow her.

514
00:58:42.189 --> 00:58:42.990
Oh.

515
00:58:44.191 --> 00:58:45.192
Okay, I got you.

516
00:58:49.196 --> 00:58:50.397
Does Ma know about this?

517
00:58:53.267 --> 00:58:55.269
Get the fuck out
and get the girls.

518
00:58:55.302 --> 00:58:56.537
Get the fuck out of here!

519
00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:00.574
Come on.

520
00:59:01.642 --> 00:59:03.510
Hold on, hold
on, hold on, hold on.

521
00:59:03.544 --> 00:59:05.012
Where you taking them?

522
00:59:05.045 --> 00:59:07.114
You got your
money, you did your job.

523
00:59:07.147 --> 00:59:08.015
You're done here.

524
00:59:08.048 --> 00:59:10.184
You, you, you, come
on, come with me.

525
00:59:11.385 --> 00:59:12.353
Move!

526
00:59:36.043 --> 00:59:38.112
Hey, what the fuck...

527
00:59:38.145 --> 00:59:39.880
Got a problem?

528
00:59:45.252 --> 00:59:47.588
Hey Ma, Ma!

529
00:59:47.621 --> 00:59:49.289
How come you're not
picking up your phone?

530
00:59:55.262 --> 00:59:56.530
Ma, you know what
this bitch is doing?

531
00:59:56.563 --> 00:59:57.998
You talking about
the massage parlor?

532
00:59:58.031 --> 00:59:59.299
Hey, something funny, huh?

533
01:00:00.734 --> 01:00:02.236
She's fucking with my money, Ma.

534
01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:03.036
Calm down.

535
01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:04.338
Hey, you think
you're in charge?

536
01:00:06.006 --> 01:00:07.641
I said do you think
you're in charge?

537
01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:14.281
Ma, I'm gonna kill
this bitch right here.

538
01:00:18.285 --> 01:00:19.987
- Fuck...
- Hey, you!

539
01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:20.654
Out.

540
01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:10.637
God, I fucking hate you.

541
01:01:56.617 --> 01:01:58.752
I'm worried about Rambo.

542
01:02:04.191 --> 01:02:06.560
I've got a nephew in Toronto

543
01:02:06.593 --> 01:02:10.030
that wants to smuggle
through Belize.

544
01:02:12.332 --> 01:02:13.433
These aren't Chinese.

545
01:02:14.836 --> 01:02:16.136
Who are they?

546
01:02:16.871 --> 01:02:17.704
Refugees.

547
01:02:19.373 --> 01:02:21.675
Another country, higher
risk, more money.

548
01:02:24.778 --> 01:02:26.313
I want you to do it.

549
01:02:31.718 --> 01:02:32.686
I don't think so.

550
01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.329
I need to make sure
nothing goes wrong.

551
01:02:45.365 --> 01:02:46.667
To make sure Rambo's okay.

552
01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:57.578
I want you to do it.

553
01:02:59.179 --> 01:03:01.148
It'll be good for both of you.

554
01:03:03.617 --> 01:03:04.518
The family.

555
01:03:18.599 --> 01:03:19.433
Do it for me.

556
01:03:27.641 --> 01:03:29.309
I'll clear your debt.

557
01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:50.397
So I've
been following Tse-jia

558
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:51.899
like you told me to.

559
01:03:51.933 --> 01:03:53.467
She keeps going to this church.

560
01:03:54.701 --> 01:03:56.470
What's she doing there?

561
01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:57.337
I'm not sure.

562
01:03:59.339 --> 01:04:00.307
Just
keep following her.

563
01:04:02.275 --> 01:04:03.644
Hey ding dong!

564
01:04:03.677 --> 01:04:04.511
Come here.

565
01:04:09.216 --> 01:04:10.250
What do you want?

566
01:04:12.854 --> 01:04:13.787
Why are you here?

567
01:04:15.522 --> 01:04:17.224
We don't need your help.

568
01:04:17.257 --> 01:04:18.759
I'm only here
because of your mom.

569
01:04:30.972 --> 01:04:32.907
How did it get over
the border?

570
01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.242
White sting hauler can
go anywhere you want.

571
01:04:40.247 --> 01:04:41.314
I'll go check on them first.

572
01:04:41.348 --> 01:04:43.784
What? No, no, no, we don't
got time for that shit.

573
01:04:43.818 --> 01:04:44.986
We gotta drive all
night, let's go.

574
01:04:45.019 --> 01:04:46.653
You have no idea
what it's like

575
01:04:46.687 --> 01:04:48.388
to be in a shipping container.

576
01:04:49.857 --> 01:04:51.291
Maybe we could
just go check, Bo.

577
01:04:51.324 --> 01:04:53.293
Maybe they gotta
pee or something.

578
01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:57.397
Bullshit.

579
01:05:05.639 --> 01:05:06.941
Fuck!

580
01:05:06.974 --> 01:05:08.341
What?

581
01:05:09.276 --> 01:05:11.012
Oh shit, yo, Bo!

582
01:05:11.045 --> 01:05:12.779
Bo, you gotta come
over here, Bo!

583
01:05:12.814 --> 01:05:14.681
What is
wrong with you?

584
01:05:14.715 --> 01:05:15.850
Come
on, Bo, you got,

585
01:05:15.883 --> 01:05:17.617
please just come over here!

586
01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:20.420
What is it, some bullshit?

587
01:05:20.454 --> 01:05:22.622
Oh shit.

588
01:05:23.958 --> 01:05:25.692
Oh shit, oh fuck.

589
01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:29.696
Shit, shit.

590
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.903
Get the fuck up here!

591
01:05:35.937 --> 01:05:38.039
Come
on, man, I can't.

592
01:05:38.072 --> 01:05:40.340
Get the
fuck in here now!

593
01:06:01.361 --> 01:06:02.496
Hey, help me with this one.

594
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:04.531
I can't, bro, I can't.

595
01:06:04.564 --> 01:06:05.732
Look at all the fucking
dead bodies, Bo.

596
01:06:05.766 --> 01:06:06.901
Man, get the fuck out of here!

597
01:06:06.934 --> 01:06:07.734
You come here.

598
01:06:12.339 --> 01:06:13.373
Move this one.

599
01:06:20.614 --> 01:06:22.083
Bingo.

600
01:06:22.116 --> 01:06:24.518
There's 50 more kilos in here,
we'll find them in New York.

601
01:06:25.786 --> 01:06:27.354
Bro, somebody
left the freezer on.

602
01:06:27.387 --> 01:06:29.957
Hey, we stick to the plan
and we drive back tonight.

603
01:06:29.991 --> 01:06:31.058
How we
gonna drive back

604
01:06:31.092 --> 01:06:32.059
with all these things
back here, bro?

605
01:06:37.064 --> 01:06:38.498
Fuck!

606
01:06:38.532 --> 01:06:41.002
Every single fucking
time because of you.

607
01:06:41.035 --> 01:06:42.904
Get your fucking
drugs, let's go.

608
01:06:42.937 --> 01:06:45.472
They showed up like this.
This ain't my fucking fault.

609
01:06:46.439 --> 01:06:47.440
Yeah it is.

610
01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:52.079
You gonna fucking stand there?

611
01:06:52.113 --> 01:06:52.947
Let's go!

612
01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.035
Hey.

613
01:07:18.072 --> 01:07:19.439
It's your cut.

614
01:07:29.783 --> 01:07:32.053
38 bodies
were found frozen dead

615
01:07:32.086 --> 01:07:34.554
in an abandoned
refrigerated smuggling truck

616
01:07:34.588 --> 01:07:36.123
in Queens today.

617
01:07:36.157 --> 01:07:38.159
Authorities have not
determined the origin

618
01:07:38.192 --> 01:07:40.560
of the immigrants,
but the DEA suspects

619
01:07:40.594 --> 01:07:41.996
narcotics to be involved.

620
01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:44.098
The truck originated
from Toronto, Canada,

621
01:07:44.131 --> 01:07:46.533
and normally transports
frozen lobsters

622
01:07:46.566 --> 01:07:48.970
for Uncle Beth's Seafood
Company in Chinatown.

623
01:07:49.904 --> 01:07:51.906
The suspects are still at large.

624
01:08:10.724 --> 01:08:11.826
All my debts are paid.

625
01:08:13.127 --> 01:08:14.694
I can't work for you anymore.

626
01:08:16.898 --> 01:08:18.398
You know you're special.

627
01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:26.573
Look, I didn't work this hard
for Rambo to fuck it all up.

628
01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:29.911
You saved me a fortune.

629
01:08:30.811 --> 01:08:32.746
I didn't do that for you.

630
01:08:32.779 --> 01:08:33.881
I did that to survive.

631
01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:34.781
I respect that.

632
01:08:37.051 --> 01:08:39.519
What if I can offer
you something better?

633
01:08:41.188 --> 01:08:42.622
I'll double your pay.

634
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.062
And give you the dumpling house.

635
01:08:54.135 --> 01:08:55.002
People depend on me.

636
01:08:57.671 --> 01:08:59.840
When I'm gone, people
can depend on you.

637
01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:26.078
Sister Tse, I'm worried about my family.

638
01:11:26.119 --> 01:11:32.084
Last I heard they were in Montreal.

639
01:11:32.125 --> 01:11:34.628
Don't worry. The van will come soon.

640
01:11:35.128 --> 01:11:36.463
Thank you.

641
01:11:36.505 --> 01:11:40.467
Dai Mah doesn't know about this.
Let's keep it that way.

642
01:11:40.509 --> 01:11:41.510
No problem.

643
01:11:45.239 --> 01:11:46.606
Hey, come on.

644
01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.995
What's going on here?

645
01:12:08.028 --> 01:12:09.029
They just traveled 8,000 miles

646
01:12:09.063 --> 01:12:10.131
and you're gonna
bring them here?

647
01:12:10.164 --> 01:12:11.932
The fuck is wrong with you?

648
01:12:24.311 --> 01:12:26.746
- I wanna ask you...
- No English.

649
01:12:28.349 --> 01:12:30.117
Mei-Ying Tse?

650
01:12:30.151 --> 01:12:31.185
That is your name, right?

651
01:12:32.386 --> 01:12:35.156
I wanna ask you
about a snakehead.

652
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:36.723
Pearl Ho.

653
01:12:36.756 --> 01:12:38.292
Also known as Dai Mah.

654
01:12:41.262 --> 01:12:45.266
It turns out your fingerprints
are all over the truck.

655
01:12:46.967 --> 01:12:49.303
You're gonna tell me all
about the frozen bodies.

656
01:12:51.138 --> 01:12:55.409
Or we can talk
about your daughter.

657
01:13:04.518 --> 01:13:08.189
Is your survival more
important than hers?

658
01:13:30.878 --> 01:13:31.879
All right then.

659
01:13:35.049 --> 01:13:39.153
Sister Tse, let's start
from the beginning.

660
01:13:44.158 --> 01:13:48.761
When I was three, my
mother sold me for $1,000.

661
01:13:49.964 --> 01:13:50.965
I never blamed her.

662
01:13:51.932 --> 01:13:52.833
What could she do?

663
01:13:54.068 --> 01:13:56.203
How could anyone
blame a prostitute?

664
01:13:58.205 --> 01:14:00.507
I grew up hard
learning one thing.

665
01:14:00.541 --> 01:14:01.741
Survival.

666
01:14:05.012 --> 01:14:06.380
My name is Tse Mei-Ying.

667
01:14:07.348 --> 01:14:09.283
But people call me Sister Tse.

668
01:14:13.053 --> 01:14:14.955
I never believed in
the American dream.

669
01:14:16.023 --> 01:14:17.825
All I knew was how to survive.

670
01:14:20.261 --> 01:14:21.962
For me and my family.

671
01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:28.869
Thank you, Dai Mah.

672
01:14:28.902 --> 01:14:29.970
We protect our own.

673
01:14:31.972 --> 01:14:34.908
Sorry we didn't get to you
earlier. These things take time.

674
01:14:50.624 --> 01:14:52.559
You've nothing to worry about.

675
01:14:52.593 --> 01:14:53.861
We're family.

676
01:15:06.307 --> 01:15:08.042
Come on, I gotta
show you something.

677
01:15:08.075 --> 01:15:09.510
All right, this
better be good.

678
01:15:11.345 --> 01:15:13.113
There you go.

679
01:15:13.147 --> 01:15:13.981
Wait.

680
01:15:16.216 --> 01:15:17.051
Me?

681
01:15:17.084 --> 01:15:18.285
It's all yours.

682
01:15:22.956 --> 01:15:24.892
Oh, Tse, you're amazing.

683
01:15:25.893 --> 01:15:26.527
Wow.

684
01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:31.065
What?

685
01:15:34.134 --> 01:15:36.070
You know I worry
about you sometimes.

686
01:15:37.504 --> 01:15:38.972
What's there to worry about?

687
01:15:41.408 --> 01:15:43.377
You have more
than enough money.

688
01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:45.045
Why are you still doing this?

689
01:15:49.416 --> 01:15:50.351
Enjoy this, okay?

690
01:15:58.359 --> 01:16:00.361
Did you hear what
Sister Tse did?

691
01:16:00.394 --> 01:16:01.995
She started
smuggling on the side

692
01:16:02.029 --> 01:16:04.164
and got caught by
the FBI, dumb bitch.

693
01:16:05.265 --> 01:16:07.568
You want me to kill Tse-jia?

694
01:16:07.601 --> 01:16:09.470
No, I need some leverage.

695
01:16:10.604 --> 01:16:12.639
Get me that little
girl she's been seeing.

696
01:16:13.974 --> 01:16:15.409
You want me to
kill the little girl?

697
01:16:15.442 --> 01:16:16.243
No!

698
01:16:16.276 --> 01:16:17.344
Just bring her to me.

699
01:18:05.219 --> 01:18:06.253
Hello?

700
01:18:07.354 --> 01:18:08.789
Anybody home?

701
01:18:08.823 --> 01:18:09.990
Hello!

702
01:18:19.166 --> 01:18:20.000
Sup?

703
01:18:21.101 --> 01:18:21.735
Nice place.

704
01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:24.104
Bo know about this?

705
01:18:25.339 --> 01:18:26.740
You might need a new job soon.

706
01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:29.543
Work for you?

707
01:18:30.344 --> 01:18:31.612
Huh?

708
01:18:31.645 --> 01:18:33.313
Are you fucking crazy?

709
01:18:35.349 --> 01:18:37.384
You seem to be
forgetting your place.

710
01:18:40.287 --> 01:18:41.688
Hey,
hey, hey, hey!

711
01:18:43.557 --> 01:18:45.158
Oh.

712
01:18:45.192 --> 01:18:47.628
You motherfuckers
wanna play, huh?

713
01:18:47.661 --> 01:18:49.263
You motherfuckers wanna play?

714
01:18:51.431 --> 01:18:53.233
Bring it, bring
it, motherfuckers!

715
01:18:53.267 --> 01:18:53.902
Huh?

716
01:18:55.235 --> 01:18:56.570
I'm gonna fucking enjoy this.

717
01:18:57.872 --> 01:19:00.173
That little fucking bitch
Rosie, she's fucking next!

718
01:19:22.195 --> 01:19:23.430
Do it, do it!

719
01:22:34.654 --> 01:22:37.290
I gave you everything and
treated you like a daughter

720
01:22:37.324 --> 01:22:38.358
from the beginning.

721
01:22:41.561 --> 01:22:44.798
You mean a life of
slavery and violence?

722
01:22:44.832 --> 01:22:47.034
Or all your bullshit
about family and loyalty?

723
01:22:47.068 --> 01:22:48.668
Ungrateful prostitute.

724
01:22:50.071 --> 01:22:53.040
You wanna know why
I am like I am?

725
01:22:53.074 --> 01:22:54.809
Because I have to be.

726
01:22:56.010 --> 01:22:58.411
That's what makes America work.

727
01:22:58.445 --> 01:23:00.413
You lied and cheat
your own people.

728
01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:05.685
I didn't force you to do shit.

729
01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.389
You cheated those
migrants just like me.

730
01:23:10.124 --> 01:23:11.691
I'll never be like you.

731
01:23:12.592 --> 01:23:15.395
We're the same, and the why?

732
01:23:15.428 --> 01:23:16.063
Guilt.

733
01:23:17.764 --> 01:23:20.034
It eats your heart
out from the inside.

734
01:23:22.003 --> 01:23:24.071
It takes a lot to
give up a child

735
01:23:26.073 --> 01:23:27.574
for your own survival.

736
01:23:30.845 --> 01:23:33.647
Like I said before,
the past is the past.

737
01:23:35.749 --> 01:23:38.085
We make our own fate here.

738
01:23:42.089 --> 01:23:44.524
Shooting me does you nothing.

739
01:23:46.626 --> 01:23:48.562
When I'm dead, the money's gone.

740
01:23:52.499 --> 01:23:54.035
Or you could have it all.

741
01:23:56.871 --> 01:23:58.940
I'll get your daughter back.

742
01:24:12.086 --> 01:24:14.721
What about the FBI,
the delivery truck?

743
01:24:17.024 --> 01:24:18.692
Rambo killed the gweilo driver

744
01:24:18.725 --> 01:24:20.995
and the Flushing crew is gone.

745
01:24:21.028 --> 01:24:23.663
The only thing tying us
to frozen bodies is you.

746
01:24:27.068 --> 01:24:28.002
What about Rambo?

747
01:24:29.036 --> 01:24:31.738
Rambo's my son. He'll obey.

748
01:24:31.771 --> 01:24:33.440
But you have to
make up with him.

749
01:24:33.473 --> 01:24:35.442
He's still sour about Pai Gwut.

750
01:24:41.082 --> 01:24:44.051
You come to the
wedding, bring lobsters.

751
01:24:44.085 --> 01:24:46.386
My good son's finally
getting married.

752
01:25:19.854 --> 01:25:22.756
What about the
FBI, the delivery truck?

753
01:25:24.825 --> 01:25:26.459
Rambo
killed the gweilo driver

754
01:25:26.493 --> 01:25:28.195
and the Flushing crew is gone.

755
01:25:29.230 --> 01:25:31.698
The only thing tying us to
the frozen bodies is you.

756
01:25:48.515 --> 01:25:49.683
Leave Rosie alone.

757
01:25:52.585 --> 01:25:54.989
And why would I wanna
hurt a little girl, huh?

758
01:25:56.157 --> 01:25:57.490
Killing Zareeb?

759
01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:00.828
Yeah, that was
payback for Pai Gwut.

760
01:26:03.931 --> 01:26:04.731
I get it.

761
01:26:08.635 --> 01:26:10.470
And you don't
answer to Ma anymore.

762
01:26:12.106 --> 01:26:13.606
You're my pet now.

763
01:26:23.217 --> 01:26:24.784
Mom, come on up here!

764
01:26:26.187 --> 01:26:28.722
I just wanted everyone
to raise a glass

765
01:26:28.755 --> 01:26:31.658
to the woman who made me
the man that I am today.

766
01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:35.096
A woman who raised me
when we had nothing.

767
01:26:39.166 --> 01:26:40.968
But killing Zareeb?

768
01:26:41.002 --> 01:26:42.970
That was payback for Pai Gwut.

769
01:26:55.016 --> 01:26:56.017
Here's to you, Mom.

770
01:27:17.204 --> 01:27:19.073
Where's Rambo?

771
01:27:19.106 --> 01:27:20.141
The fuck is this?

772
01:27:20.174 --> 01:27:21.541
I didn't do shit!

773
01:28:43.224 --> 01:28:45.658
I didn't come
for the American dream.

774
01:28:46.793 --> 01:28:47.694
I came for family.

775
01:29:04.278 --> 01:29:06.280
I left her once for my survival.

776
01:29:07.815 --> 01:29:11.085
This time, I leave her for hers.

777
01:31:15.487 --> 01:31:20.487
