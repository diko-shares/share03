00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:31.408
Where are you from?

2
00:16:36.622 --> 00:16:37.581
Just a little.

3
00:16:38.207 --> 00:16:39.416
But my French is much better.

4
00:35:03.937 --> 00:35:04.438
Please...

5
00:35:12.738 --> 00:35:13.739
Fat Boy.

6
00:35:39.556 --> 00:35:41.266
You would crush her, Fat Boy.

7
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.751
Can you help me?

8
00:39:35.792 --> 00:39:37.211
I need to get in touch with my cousin.

9
00:39:38.003 --> 00:39:39.171
Do they have the money?

10
00:39:39.213 --> 00:39:41.548
They are trying to get the loan.

11
00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:42.966
Here. Call now.

12
00:39:43.008 --> 00:39:44.009
Thank you.

13
00:46:47.015 --> 00:46:48.225
Where's my cargo?

14
00:46:50.435 --> 00:46:51.603
What's the rush?

15
00:46:51.645 --> 00:46:53.188
You are a long way from home.

16
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:54.439
Have a drink.

17
00:46:56.859 --> 00:46:58.986
I'm here to do a job.

18
00:46:59.027 --> 00:47:03.991
I miss New York. How's
Dai Mah? Paigwut?

19
00:47:04.032 --> 00:47:06.201
Is Rambo out of jail yet?

20
00:47:06.243 --> 00:47:08.954
He must be all grown up.

21
00:47:10.455 --> 00:47:15.043
There's a typhoon coming
and we need to leave.

22
00:47:15.878 --> 00:47:17.087
Where are my people?

23
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:40.068
They all paid and are ready to go.

24
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:42.863
Hey! When are we leaving?

25
00:47:42.905 --> 00:47:44.865
We've been here for over three months!

26
00:47:44.907 --> 00:47:45.866
Shut up!

27
00:47:47.075 --> 00:47:48.035
Why do you talk so much?

28
00:47:48.076 --> 00:47:49.494
Whatever I tell you
to do, you do.

29
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.042
The ports will shut down
the ports tomorrow.

30
00:47:55.083 --> 00:47:56.877
You can't afford to keep them
here another month.

31
00:47:58.921 --> 00:48:00.130
Don't you think I know that?

32
00:48:03.091 --> 00:48:04.676
No. We leave tonight.

33
00:48:04.718 --> 00:48:05.719
How?

34
00:48:09.097 --> 00:48:11.058
If you follow me, I will
deliver you safe.

35
00:48:33.747 --> 00:48:38.544
From here, we take a container boat
from Taishan to Guatemala.

36
00:48:40.128 --> 00:48:43.757
There, a Coyote will smuggle
us north to America.

37
00:48:46.927 --> 00:48:51.932
Watch out for Cartel and Militia.
They own the border.

38
00:54:47.496 --> 00:54:48.497
Sister Tse.

39
00:54:58.298 --> 00:54:59.925
Amir, it's you! How are you doing?

40
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:05.514
Thank God, thank God!
God is great! Wonderful!

41
00:55:06.139 --> 00:55:07.766
Thank you very much!
Thank you!

42
00:55:08.308 --> 00:55:12.729
She got the visa! She is finally coming!
Tse, she is coming!

43
00:55:22.948 --> 00:55:26.285
Sister Tse, I know this
payment isn't enough.

44
00:55:26.326 --> 00:55:27.536
My daughter's been sick.

45
00:55:27.953 --> 00:55:29.705
I promise I won't run.

46
00:55:29.746 --> 00:55:30.956
Can you give me more time?

47
00:55:35.961 --> 00:55:37.963
Thank you, Sister Tse.
Thank you! Thank you!

48
00:55:42.968 --> 00:55:44.720
Do you like lobsters?

49
00:55:44.761 --> 00:55:46.513
Come to my place.
I'll take care of you.

50
00:55:46.555 --> 00:55:47.556
Thank you.

51
00:56:59.628 --> 00:57:03.590
Sister Tse! Lots of lobsters!

52
00:57:03.632 --> 00:57:05.634
Come up!
Come up!

53
00:57:11.473 --> 00:57:13.308
Sister Tse! Sister Tse!

54
00:57:14.059 --> 00:57:16.937
Here's a large box of lobsters for you.

55
00:57:17.855 --> 00:57:20.065
Also, these guys I trust.

56
00:57:20.858 --> 00:57:23.944
If you need help with anything,
don't be afraid to ask.

57
00:57:25.279 --> 00:57:26.280
Thank you.

58
00:57:36.665 --> 00:57:39.251
You work for Dai Mah, right?

59
00:57:40.294 --> 00:57:44.673
I need help getting my wife
and daughter here.

60
00:57:45.674 --> 00:57:47.259
You should talk to Dai Mah.

61
00:57:47.301 --> 00:57:49.636
I don't trust Dai Mah.

62
00:57:49.678 --> 00:57:52.556
People are just cargo to her.

63
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:57.728
This is my wife and child.

64
00:58:01.106 --> 00:58:04.568
I can help you, but Dai Mah can't know.

65
00:58:05.694 --> 00:58:06.695
Thank you.

66
01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:26.078
Sister Tse, I'm worried about my family.

67
01:11:26.119 --> 01:11:32.084
Last I heard they were in Montreal.

68
01:11:32.125 --> 01:11:34.628
Don't worry. The van will come soon.

69
01:11:35.128 --> 01:11:36.463
Thank you.

70
01:11:36.505 --> 01:11:40.467
Dai Mah doesn't know about this.
Let's keep it that way.

71
01:11:40.509 --> 01:11:41.510
No problem.

72
01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:29.543
Work for you?
