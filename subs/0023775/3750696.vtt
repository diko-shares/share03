00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:23.757
Hi, son. You go home and tell Mom
I'll be home in a few minutes.

2
00:01:23.932 --> 00:01:25.866
-Now, let's go up.
-All right.

3
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:31.796
Come on, fellas.

4
00:01:34.843 --> 00:01:38.210
All right, Eddie. I'll give you
the 50 cents when I change the buck.

5
00:01:44.787 --> 00:01:46.550
Sixty dames.

6
00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:49.250
Come on, Nick, what do you say?

7
00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:51.791
Come on, Nick, what do you say?

8
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.655
Hello, boys.

9
00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.821
Hello. How's the old woman?
Glad to see you.

10
00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.557
-Come on in, Joe.
-Glad to be here.

11
00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:01.498
Yeah, sure. Have a good one.

12
00:02:01.937 --> 00:02:04.497
-What did you do that for?
-Why, I'll give it to you.

13
00:02:04.673 --> 00:02:07.107
-Hey, Cliff.
-Well, what are you gonna have?

14
00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:11.406
-Beer, and hurry it up.
-Right. Come on with that beer.

15
00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.389
Hey, where's Lily?

16
00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:25.356
Oh, I'll find her. Oh, Lily.

17
00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.000
Where is she?

18
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.502
-Where'd she go?
-I don't know.

19
00:02:37.673 --> 00:02:40.506
Now look what you went and done.
You're fired.

20
00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:43.042
-You lazy, thieving little son of a--
-Hey.

21
00:02:43.378 --> 00:02:45.505
-Easy with the whip.
-You keep out of this.

22
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:47.911
-Go on, get out of my house.
-If Chico goes, I go.

23
00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:49.175
-What?
-You heard me.

24
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:51.876
Don't you talk to me that way.
I'm your father!

25
00:02:52.054 --> 00:02:53.578
-That's my tough luck.
-Listen--

26
00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:57.715
Now get this.
If I stay here, Chico stays too.

27
00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:08.766
Take some beer out to the boys,
will you, Lily?

28
00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.237
Clean that up, Chico.

29
00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:19.741
-Here's Lily!
-Lily, how are you?

30
00:03:19.915 --> 00:03:22.406
-Hello, Lily.
-Thattagirl.

31
00:03:22.584 --> 00:03:24.142
What's your hurry?

32
00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.516
-Some beer here, Lily.
-Ain't that funny?

33
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:33.887
-Come here, sweetheart.
-Oh, lay off, you big ape.

34
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.427
Over here, honey. Give me a bottle
of that stuff, will you? I missed you.

35
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.127
-Yeah?
-Put a head on this, will you?

36
00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:45.831
A couple of glasses.
Here's looking, Lily.

37
00:04:00.322 --> 00:04:02.381
How's things, baby?

38
00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:06.791
Let's me and you take a little walk
over by the quarry, huh?

39
00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:08.862
Come on in, Cragg.

40
00:04:10.432 --> 00:04:14.493
-Hey, cobbler, when do I get my shoes?
-When you pay for them.

41
00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:19.470
-What do you say, do we take a walk?
-I can hardly wait.

42
00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.339
-Hello, Mr. Cragg.
-Sit down.

43
00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:25.377
-Beer?
-Yeah.

44
00:04:25.547 --> 00:04:27.777
You ain't been in lately.

45
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.510
I don't care for the crowd here.

46
00:04:30.686 --> 00:04:32.449
No.

47
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:34.851
They're pretty mangy.

48
00:04:35.524 --> 00:04:38.425
How long are you going to stand it?

49
00:04:38.994 --> 00:04:41.224
Why don't you get out
before it is too late?

50
00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:44.058
-Where would I go?
-Out into the world.

51
00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:47.532
You could make something of yourself.
You have power.

52
00:04:47.703 --> 00:04:51.764
Yeah. I'm a ball of fire, I am.

53
00:04:52.107 --> 00:04:55.838
You don't realize your potentialities.

54
00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:57.505
Come again?

55
00:05:00.549 --> 00:05:02.141
Did you read that book I gave you?

56
00:05:02.317 --> 00:05:05.047
Oh, I tried to, but I didn't
understand it very good.

57
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.589
It's by Nietzsche,
the greatest philosopher of all time.

58
00:05:09.758 --> 00:05:14.058
Yeah. Well, I never did
get much good out of books.

59
00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:16.491
You are a fool.

60
00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:19.060
You could learn a lot
from that book.

61
00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:22.499
But if you are content to stay here
like a dumb animal...

62
00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:25.936
...in this miserable life,
then I wash my hands from you.

63
00:05:26.108 --> 00:05:29.475
-Gee, Mr. Cragg, you ain't sore, are you?
-Here.

64
00:05:29.645 --> 00:05:32.705
-For the beer.
-Oh, no, I couldn't take it. Not from you.

65
00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:34.940
No, no. I accept no favors.

66
00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:38.416
Oh, don't be like that.
You ain't like a customer.

67
00:05:38.587 --> 00:05:41.784
-Come in again tomorrow?
-Well...

68
00:05:41.957 --> 00:05:43.686
...we'll see.

69
00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:49.689
-Did he pay you for it?
-Yeah, but I gave it back to him.

70
00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:53.858
-Say, what do you think we're running here?
-It looks to me like a zoo.

71
00:05:56.438 --> 00:05:58.872
Four. Four and a quarter.

72
00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:02.533
Four-fifty, 4.75, 5.00.

73
00:06:05.147 --> 00:06:07.615
Another cup of coffee, honey?

74
00:06:13.588 --> 00:06:15.453
Hello.

75
00:06:15.824 --> 00:06:18.418
Well, Ed, I'm glad to see you.
Come on in.

76
00:06:18.593 --> 00:06:21.687
-It's hot tonight.
-Yeah, yeah.

77
00:06:21.863 --> 00:06:24.627
Just make yourself comfortable, Ed.

78
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:45.814
-Good night, Nick.
-Good night, boys.

79
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:48.218
-Good night, Joe.
-See you tomorrow.

80
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.517
Yeah, come back tomorrow.

81
00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:53.052
I wanna talk to you.

82
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:56.719
You fixed it with the big fella, didn't you?
They ain't gonna make no trouble?

83
00:06:56.898 --> 00:06:59.458
Yeah, that ain't what I
wanna talk to you about.

84
00:07:05.507 --> 00:07:08.169
He's a big politician, ain't he?

85
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:12.444
He's a big something,
and it ain't a politician.

86
00:07:13.515 --> 00:07:16.109
Honey, you makes me tickle.

87
00:07:22.524 --> 00:07:25.789
Chico, go downstairs
and watch the still while I'm out.

88
00:07:27.062 --> 00:07:29.826
Come on, hurry up! Get a move on you.

89
00:07:31.867 --> 00:07:34.927
Come on, old-timer, come on.

90
00:07:35.103 --> 00:07:37.469
-You and I are gonna take a walk.
-What's the matter?

91
00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:39.732
Come on. Up.

92
00:07:39.908 --> 00:07:42.069
What's the matter?

93
00:07:45.514 --> 00:07:48.278
-What's the matter?
-That's all right. Come on.

94
00:07:55.957 --> 00:07:59.449
-How are you, Lily?
-I was great up till now.

95
00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:04.556
I don't often get to see you alone.

96
00:08:12.607 --> 00:08:17.476
Oh, excuse me. My hand shakes so
when I'm around you.

97
00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:35.227
You haul your freight out of here.

98
00:08:36.665 --> 00:08:38.792
-What, you getting particular?
-Maybe I am.

99
00:08:38.967 --> 00:08:43.495
-Did you ever take a good look at yourself?
-Yeah, you're exclusive, you are.

100
00:08:43.672 --> 00:08:45.765
The sweetheart of the night shift.

101
00:08:45.941 --> 00:08:49.001
Come on, you're wasting my time.
Everybody knows about you.

102
00:08:49.177 --> 00:08:50.667
Yeah?

103
00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:53.144
Well, you ain't going to.

104
00:09:33.922 --> 00:09:36.789
-Ed. What's the matter?
-No more protection for you.

105
00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.518
I'll see that the police
close up your joint.

106
00:09:50.372 --> 00:09:51.862
Lily!

107
00:09:53.808 --> 00:09:55.742
What did you do to him, huh?

108
00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:57.708
Are you crazy?

109
00:09:57.879 --> 00:10:01.679
Ed Sipple's kept my place open. Now he's
going to the police, he's gonna close me up.

110
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.148
You done it! You never was any good.

111
00:10:04.319 --> 00:10:06.412
Pulling a thing like this,
I ought to kill you.

112
00:10:06.588 --> 00:10:09.352
-What's stopping you?
-I should've thrown you out years ago...

113
00:10:09.524 --> 00:10:12.721
-...instead of raising you the way I did!
-Yeah, the way you did.

114
00:10:12.894 --> 00:10:15.863
-You're just like your mother!
-She was lucky to get away from you.

115
00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:17.760
Was she? Look what happened to her.

116
00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:20.265
She's better dead than
living with a thing like you.

117
00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:22.960
-And I'm getting out too.
-You little tramp, you!

118
00:10:23.138 --> 00:10:27.666
Yeah, I'm a tramp, and who's to blame?
My father. A swell start you gave me.

119
00:10:27.842 --> 00:10:32.006
Ever since I was 14, what's it been?
Nothing but men! Dirty, rotten men!

120
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.344
And you're lower than any of them!
I'll hate you as long as I live!

121
00:10:36.518 --> 00:10:38.952
Mr. Powers, there's something
wrong with the still.

122
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.611
It's smoking something awful.

123
00:10:48.663 --> 00:10:51.188
Can I do something for you, honey?

124
00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:18.419
Your father's in there!

125
00:11:36.311 --> 00:11:39.041
Poor Mr. Powers. What a terrible death.

126
00:11:39.214 --> 00:11:41.114
-Nick Powers?
-Yes.

127
00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.770
Well, that's that.

128
00:12:15.083 --> 00:12:19.315
I never go to funerals.
A relic of barbarism.

129
00:12:19.487 --> 00:12:22.012
So now what?

130
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.817
Well, the future looks very bright.

131
00:12:23.992 --> 00:12:27.155
Just as I was leaving the cemetery,
Ed Sipple made me a proposition.

132
00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:29.923
And the manager of the
Star and Garter Burlesque House...

133
00:12:30.098 --> 00:12:32.464
...offered me a job in the chorus
to do a strip act.

134
00:12:32.634 --> 00:12:35.603
-A strip act?
-Yeah, show my shape.

135
00:12:36.538 --> 00:12:39.371
Well, that's a business in itself.

136
00:12:39.541 --> 00:12:42.772
Oh, I guess I ain't much
of a businesswoman.

137
00:12:42.944 --> 00:12:46.846
What's going to become of you?
It's up to you to decide.

138
00:12:47.015 --> 00:12:49.040
If you stay in this town, you are lost.

139
00:12:49.784 --> 00:12:52.480
Where would I go, Paris?
I got 4 bucks.

140
00:12:52.921 --> 00:12:56.880
That's what makes me mad with you.
You're a coward. I mean it.

141
00:12:57.058 --> 00:13:00.357
You let life defeat you.
You don't fight back.

142
00:13:00.528 --> 00:13:04.259
-What chance has a woman got?
-More chance than men.

143
00:13:04.432 --> 00:13:06.366
A woman, young, beautiful like you...

144
00:13:06.534 --> 00:13:10.732
...can get anything she wants in the world
because you have power over men.

145
00:13:10.905 --> 00:13:14.363
But you must use men,
not let them use you.

146
00:13:14.542 --> 00:13:17.511
You must be a master, not a slave.

147
00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:20.978
Look. Here. Nietzsche says:

148
00:13:21.149 --> 00:13:24.414
"All life, no matter how we idealize it...

149
00:13:24.586 --> 00:13:28.317
...is nothing more, nor less,
than exploitation."

150
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.815
That's what I'm telling you.

151
00:13:30.992 --> 00:13:32.425
Exploit yourself.

152
00:13:32.994 --> 00:13:35.929
Go to some big city
where you will find opportunities.

153
00:13:36.097 --> 00:13:38.998
Use men. Be strong!

154
00:13:39.167 --> 00:13:41.931
Defiant! Use men...

155
00:13:42.103 --> 00:13:45.504
...to get the things you want!

156
00:13:52.881 --> 00:13:54.542
Yeah.

157
00:14:28.516 --> 00:14:31.974
Hey, this is okay. Give me a match.

158
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.217
-It's awfully dark in here.
-Yeah.

159
00:14:36.658 --> 00:14:39.821
Well, the darker the better
till we pull out.

160
00:14:47.101 --> 00:14:48.625
Well...

161
00:14:49.204 --> 00:14:51.638
...the next station is New York.

162
00:15:05.353 --> 00:15:07.844
Hey, you. Come on out of there.

163
00:15:08.089 --> 00:15:10.023
Come on.

164
00:15:12.327 --> 00:15:14.022
Well, I'm a--

165
00:15:14.195 --> 00:15:16.595
Too many of you dames getting
away with it these days.

166
00:15:16.764 --> 00:15:19.790
-The cops in the yards will take care of you.
-Oh, wait a minute.

167
00:15:19.968 --> 00:15:23.699
-You wouldn't throw us off, would you?
-Yeah, and you're gonna get 30 days for it.

168
00:15:23.872 --> 00:15:27.069
-In jail?
-Yes, in jail.

169
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.943
Now, why don't we sit down
and talk this thing over.

170
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.241
That lady's dressed up.

171
00:16:46.287 --> 00:16:49.654
And look at her automobile.

172
00:16:50.925 --> 00:16:54.486
But what I wanna to find out is
how did she get them?

173
00:17:08.142 --> 00:17:10.372
I could use some of them pork chops.

174
00:17:10.545 --> 00:17:14.811
It's all in your mind.
You ate yesterday, didn't you?

175
00:17:40.908 --> 00:17:44.173
Boy, I'll bet there's plenty of dough
in this little shack.

176
00:17:58.493 --> 00:18:01.860
Say, I'd like to work in there.
Can you fix it for me?

177
00:18:07.268 --> 00:18:10.362
You might try the Personnel Department
around on 47th.

178
00:18:10.838 --> 00:18:12.829
Thanks so much.

179
00:18:13.007 --> 00:18:14.975
I'll be seeing you.

180
00:18:18.312 --> 00:18:22.180
-Get me a taxi.
-Yes, sir. Taxi!

181
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.853
-Is this where you ask for jobs?
-Yeah, this is where you ask for them.

182
00:18:38.099 --> 00:18:39.691
Wait here.

183
00:18:50.878 --> 00:18:53.904
I have good references.
If I could only see him.

184
00:18:54.082 --> 00:18:57.677
You can wait if you want to,
but he is out to lunch.

185
00:19:03.658 --> 00:19:07.116
What part of the South
are you from, Mr. Pratt?

186
00:19:08.429 --> 00:19:10.522
Tallapoosa, Georgia.

187
00:19:10.932 --> 00:19:13.264
I know some Pratts where I come from.

188
00:19:14.502 --> 00:19:15.730
Where was that?

189
00:19:16.304 --> 00:19:19.603
Oh, maybe I'll tell you someday
when I know you better.

190
00:19:20.374 --> 00:19:22.808
-Say, I like it here. How about a job?
-Oh, we don't--

191
00:19:22.977 --> 00:19:26.777
Oh, now, don't tell me in this great big
building there ain't some place for me.

192
00:19:29.717 --> 00:19:31.617
Have you had any experience?

193
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.112
Plenty.

194
00:19:37.125 --> 00:19:38.854
I'd rather wait in there.

195
00:19:39.026 --> 00:19:40.459
I hate crowds.

196
00:19:41.863 --> 00:19:43.728
Don't you?

197
00:19:45.199 --> 00:19:47.963
The boss won't be back for an hour.

198
00:19:48.603 --> 00:19:52.061
Well, then why don't we go in
and talk this over.

199
00:20:36.117 --> 00:20:38.984
-Is that a permanent?
-Yeah, they do it for 3.35...

200
00:20:39.153 --> 00:20:40.711
...at Boin's Beauty Shop.

201
00:20:40.888 --> 00:20:44.449
-Where's that at?
-81st and Broadway.

202
00:20:56.337 --> 00:20:59.534
-See that this gets off at once.
-Yes, sir.

203
00:20:59.707 --> 00:21:02.938
-Thought any more about that girl?
-No.

204
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.407
Mr. Brody, she's smart and--

205
00:21:04.579 --> 00:21:07.548
I told you once, I don't need
any more girls in my department.

206
00:21:07.715 --> 00:21:09.649
-Seventy-nine.
-Seventy-nine.

207
00:21:09.817 --> 00:21:11.785
One twenty-one.

208
00:21:12.653 --> 00:21:13.881
One twenty-one.

209
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.354
One twenty-two.

210
00:21:18.526 --> 00:21:20.016
I'll be right back.

211
00:21:22.163 --> 00:21:25.223
Oh, Mr. McCoy, those papers
will be ready in 10 minutes.

212
00:21:25.399 --> 00:21:27.128
Oh, thanks very much.

213
00:21:33.107 --> 00:21:37.009
-Who's that girl?
-That's the girl I've been telling you about.

214
00:21:37.845 --> 00:21:40.177
-One twenty-two.
-One thirty.

215
00:21:40.348 --> 00:21:41.576
One thirty.

216
00:21:41.883 --> 00:21:44.477
-Two hundred and fifty-two.
-Well...

217
00:21:44.652 --> 00:21:46.119
...maybe I could use her.

218
00:21:46.287 --> 00:21:48.187
Well, Mr. Brody, she's very intelligent.

219
00:21:48.356 --> 00:21:50.984
She's head and shoulders above
any other girl in the place.

220
00:21:51.158 --> 00:21:52.785
That so?

221
00:22:16.117 --> 00:22:19.678
-Hey, sign this, will you?
-Hello, stupid.

222
00:22:19.854 --> 00:22:22.254
-Are you married?
-No, and I know the next answer:

223
00:22:22.423 --> 00:22:25.984
I don't live with my folks. Someday
that signature will be worth money.

224
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.789
Yeah, they laughed when
I sat down to play the piano.

225
00:22:40.174 --> 00:22:43.143
This is the Benson mortgage.
Will you look it over now?

226
00:22:43.311 --> 00:22:45.643
Is the insurance clause here?

227
00:22:47.648 --> 00:22:50.640
Everything's incorporated in it.

228
00:22:54.522 --> 00:22:56.888
Stick around after 5.

229
00:22:58.459 --> 00:23:02.225
Yes, this is a very serious case.
I'm afraid we'll have to foreclose.

230
00:23:03.064 --> 00:23:07.125
Look at that, will you? Sickening,
the way those two carry on.

231
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:09.462
You'd never think he had
a wife and three kids.

232
00:23:11.906 --> 00:23:13.237
Oh, hello, Jimmy.

233
00:23:13.407 --> 00:23:15.773
Listen, Baby Face,
how about having dinner tonight?

234
00:23:15.943 --> 00:23:20.243
-I got two tickets for Vanities.
-Oh, I'd love to, but I can't tonight.

235
00:23:20.548 --> 00:23:21.947
Well, I never see you anymore.

236
00:23:22.116 --> 00:23:25.552
I never see anybody anymore.
I'm working so hard.

237
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.812
-Gee, but I--
-I'm sorry.

238
00:23:26.988 --> 00:23:30.719
I have to go to bed early every night.
Excuse me, will you?

239
00:23:32.326 --> 00:23:35.159
You don't know you're out
till they stop counting.

240
00:23:35.329 --> 00:23:39.026
Wake up, kid. Baby Face is
moving out of your class.

241
00:23:57.918 --> 00:24:00.819
Oh, not here. Somebody might....

242
00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:36.312
-Has Mr. Brody left yet?
-No, Mr. Stevens, I believe he's still here.

243
00:24:43.597 --> 00:24:45.292
Brody.

244
00:24:54.442 --> 00:24:55.431
Brody!

245
00:24:59.613 --> 00:25:01.945
This is an outrage.
A man in your position.

246
00:25:02.116 --> 00:25:04.209
Get your check at once.

247
00:25:10.357 --> 00:25:12.154
Young woman!

248
00:25:21.869 --> 00:25:25.771
We have no place here for a girl
of your sort. You're through tonight.

249
00:25:26.407 --> 00:25:30.605
Why, Mr. Stevens, it wasn't my fault.
He followed me in there.

250
00:25:30.778 --> 00:25:35.010
What could I do? He's my boss,
and I have to earn my living.

251
00:25:39.887 --> 00:25:44.984
Oh, I'm so ashamed. It's the first time
anything like that has ever happened to me.

252
00:25:46.193 --> 00:25:47.592
Well, I'll....

253
00:25:47.761 --> 00:25:50.161
I'll think it over.
Report tomorrow as usual.

254
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:52.390
Oh, thank you, Mr. Stevens.

255
00:26:17.291 --> 00:26:19.452
Mr. Stevens' office.

256
00:26:19.627 --> 00:26:22.061
No, he ain't. I mean, isn't.

257
00:26:22.229 --> 00:26:23.821
Thank you.

258
00:26:34.808 --> 00:26:36.799
-For Mr. Stevens.
-Oh, thanks.

259
00:26:40.447 --> 00:26:43.245
Do you think you'll be able to get off
in time to go shopping?

260
00:26:43.417 --> 00:26:44.816
-I don't--
-I'll take this in.

261
00:26:44.985 --> 00:26:48.045
He has to sign this voucher anyhow.

262
00:26:49.657 --> 00:26:53.593
-Well, she certainly works fast.
-It won't do her any good.

263
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:56.286
He's very much in love
with the girl he's engaged to.

264
00:26:56.463 --> 00:26:58.727
Say, I was surprised to read
that in the paper.

265
00:26:58.899 --> 00:27:02.733
It's a good match for him too.
Marrying old Carter's daughter.

266
00:27:02.903 --> 00:27:05.565
Mr. Stevens is
an extraordinarily fine person.

267
00:27:05.739 --> 00:27:09.698
He has high ideals.
He's not like other men.

268
00:27:29.296 --> 00:27:31.856
-You can't come in.
-What do you mean?

269
00:27:32.032 --> 00:27:35.524
New landlady. And she's a terror.
Won't let me have any men visitors.

270
00:27:35.703 --> 00:27:38.866
-I've gotta see you. It's been over a week.
-No, it can't be done.

271
00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:42.975
But, Lily, losing my job was bad enough,
but not seeing you is worse. I can't stand it.

272
00:27:43.143 --> 00:27:45.805
No, it's wrong. My conscience
has been bothering me.

273
00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.743
-But you--
-Think of your wife and kids.

274
00:27:47.915 --> 00:27:50.247
I can't see you anymore.

275
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.551
Lily--

276
00:28:02.997 --> 00:28:06.865
-Who was it, honey?
-Oh, just a boy collecting for the paper.

277
00:28:07.034 --> 00:28:09.730
-Have a drink?
-No, thanks. I never touch it.

278
00:28:09.903 --> 00:28:12.371
Oh, you don't want me to drink alone.

279
00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:13.870
Well...

280
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:16.134
...maybe just a sip.

281
00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.831
Hello? Tell Mr. Stevens that his fiancée
is upstairs with her father...

282
00:28:44.004 --> 00:28:45.801
...and she'll be right down to see him.

283
00:28:45.973 --> 00:28:47.634
Thank you.

284
00:28:58.052 --> 00:28:59.781
Oh, Miss Merrick, I've changed my mind.

285
00:28:59.953 --> 00:29:03.252
Could you go to lunch now?
I'd like to get a manicure at 1:00.

286
00:29:03.424 --> 00:29:05.688
That's quite all right.

287
00:29:31.518 --> 00:29:34.351
Haven't I told you never to come
beyond the front of this desk?

288
00:29:34.521 --> 00:29:37.615
Oh, but I get so lonesome
out there all by myself.

289
00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:39.258
Now, don't do that.

290
00:29:39.426 --> 00:29:41.485
How do you expect me
to get any work done?

291
00:29:41.662 --> 00:29:43.687
Hold me close.

292
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:09.981
Anne.

293
00:30:10.157 --> 00:30:12.182
Anne, listen to me.

294
00:30:33.514 --> 00:30:37.006
Paragraph. It has always been
the policy of this institution...

295
00:30:37.184 --> 00:30:39.550
-...to appoint its customers--
-Father!

296
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.711
My darling. What is it?

297
00:30:41.889 --> 00:30:43.220
What is it?

298
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.585
Anne, please, dear.

299
00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:49.889
What? Tell me.
Tell me what happened.

300
00:30:50.063 --> 00:30:52.190
-Anne, please.
-There's nothing he can say.

301
00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:54.060
I don't wanna see him.

302
00:30:54.234 --> 00:30:55.667
-What happened, Ned?
-Why, I--

303
00:30:55.836 --> 00:30:58.964
Send him away, please. I can't.

304
00:30:59.139 --> 00:31:00.800
Perhaps you'd better wait outside.

305
00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:38.302
There seems to be only one thing
to do, Ned. Let that girl go.

306
00:31:45.385 --> 00:31:47.853
-Is that all to go out?
-Listen to this, will you:

307
00:31:48.021 --> 00:31:49.682
"When guests enter the dining room...

308
00:31:49.857 --> 00:31:53.816
...it is customary for the butler to hold out
the chair of the mistress of the house.

309
00:31:53.994 --> 00:31:57.191
If there are footmen enough,
the chair of each lady is held for her."

310
00:31:57.364 --> 00:31:59.958
See that you don't forget that now.

311
00:32:01.635 --> 00:32:03.694
Come in a minute, please.

312
00:32:15.716 --> 00:32:17.240
Lily...

313
00:32:17.417 --> 00:32:19.408
...it's too bad that happened.

314
00:32:19.853 --> 00:32:22.822
I-- I'll have to let you go.

315
00:32:23.657 --> 00:32:25.420
Yes.

316
00:32:26.693 --> 00:32:28.718
Well, I have no choice.

317
00:32:28.896 --> 00:32:30.056
You understand.

318
00:32:34.601 --> 00:32:38.401
Anyway, it's better this way.
I'd rather you don't work.

319
00:32:43.243 --> 00:32:45.507
I don't wanna quit the job.

320
00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:48.045
I like to be near you.

321
00:32:48.815 --> 00:32:51.181
I don't see you much as it is.

322
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:53.148
Well, I'm sorry, Lily.

323
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.720
There's nothing else for me to do.

324
00:32:56.089 --> 00:32:58.216
You can't stay here.

325
00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.452
All right.

326
00:33:01.628 --> 00:33:04.392
If I have to go, it means
that you won't see me anymore.

327
00:33:04.565 --> 00:33:06.430
-Look here.
-No, that's all there is to it.

328
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.627
If you fire me, we're through.
It isn't the job, I don't mind that.

329
00:33:10.804 --> 00:33:13.329
But it just goes to show me
how much you care.

330
00:33:13.507 --> 00:33:15.839
-Well, you know how much I--
-How much you what?

331
00:33:23.216 --> 00:33:25.616
Are you letting me go?

332
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:40.431
Ned, you can't do this thing.

333
00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:43.263
I don't want to hand your resignation
to the board.

334
00:33:43.437 --> 00:33:46.998
I'm sorry, Mr. Carter,
but I can't discharge the girl.

335
00:33:47.174 --> 00:33:50.007
-I know it's difficult, but now, look here--
-It's no use.

336
00:33:50.177 --> 00:33:52.509
I know what you're going to say,
but I can't help it.

337
00:33:52.679 --> 00:33:54.579
I'm willing to take the consequences.

338
00:33:54.748 --> 00:33:57.342
I know it means my job.
And Anne will break our engagement.

339
00:33:57.517 --> 00:33:59.610
Now, now, take it easy.

340
00:33:59.786 --> 00:34:02.880
This needn't be the end of the world.

341
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.987
Naturally, you're upset.

342
00:34:05.158 --> 00:34:08.389
But after all,
you and I understand each other.

343
00:34:08.862 --> 00:34:11.330
Suppose you let me handle this thing.

344
00:34:11.498 --> 00:34:12.965
What you need is a little change.

345
00:34:13.133 --> 00:34:16.694
A few days at White Sulphur.
Or even at Atlantic City.

346
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:19.532
That'll give you time to think things over.

347
00:34:19.706 --> 00:34:22.607
Meantime, leave everything to me.

348
00:34:22.776 --> 00:34:25.267
What do you say, huh?

349
00:34:28.448 --> 00:34:30.211
-Thanks a lot.
-Yeah.

350
00:34:37.557 --> 00:34:39.149
Yes?

351
00:34:39.326 --> 00:34:41.055
Thank you.

352
00:34:41.561 --> 00:34:44.689
Mr. Carter would like to see you
right away.

353
00:34:44.931 --> 00:34:46.558
Me?

354
00:35:03.316 --> 00:35:07.446
I won't waste words with you.
This is a very serious matter.

355
00:35:07.754 --> 00:35:11.520
Of course, you realize that Mr. Stevens
is engaged to my daughter?

356
00:35:11.692 --> 00:35:13.717
Engaged?

357
00:35:14.094 --> 00:35:16.460
Why, I had no idea.

358
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.325
Oh, it can't be true.

359
00:35:18.498 --> 00:35:21.365
You mean, you didn't know
he was to be married?

360
00:35:22.269 --> 00:35:25.363
Oh, no. He told me I was the only one.

361
00:35:26.073 --> 00:35:28.473
My daughter is heartbroken.

362
00:35:28.642 --> 00:35:30.405
But what about me?

363
00:35:32.479 --> 00:35:35.915
You're not asking me
to give him up, are you?

364
00:35:38.351 --> 00:35:40.717
Oh, how could I?

365
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:46.516
Did he mean so much to you?

366
00:35:47.561 --> 00:35:49.529
Everything in the world.

367
00:35:51.832 --> 00:35:55.495
Was he your first sweetheart?

368
00:35:57.938 --> 00:36:00.566
This is very distressing.

369
00:36:01.475 --> 00:36:03.739
I'm sure you must see
how impossible it would be...

370
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.775
...for you to remain at the bank.

371
00:36:05.946 --> 00:36:08.141
But what will I do?

372
00:36:08.315 --> 00:36:11.751
-Have you no family in New York?
-No, I'm all alone here.

373
00:36:11.918 --> 00:36:15.376
I haven't any friends
and I haven't any money.

374
00:36:15.856 --> 00:36:18.586
I shall have to think this over.

375
00:36:27.968 --> 00:36:29.526
Will you tell me where you live?

376
00:36:30.137 --> 00:36:33.197
My telephone number is Schuyler 3-2215.

377
00:36:44.384 --> 00:36:46.614
-Miss Powers?
-Yes, sir. Come right in.

378
00:36:46.787 --> 00:36:48.152
Thank you.

379
00:37:23.456 --> 00:37:26.721
-Good morning.
-Oh, good morning.

380
00:37:55.188 --> 00:37:58.487
-Is these new furs, honey?
-Not so much "honey."

381
00:37:58.658 --> 00:38:00.751
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:38:09.202 --> 00:38:12.000
Oh, before I forget it,
Mr. Carter called up.

383
00:38:12.172 --> 00:38:15.039
-He's coming up for dinner.
-Yeah?

384
00:38:15.242 --> 00:38:18.006
Give the old boy Irish stew.

385
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:27.386
Oh, Hodges, we'll have coffee
and liqueurs in here.

386
00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:32.052
Did Fuzzy-Wuzzy enjoy his dinner?

387
00:38:35.095 --> 00:38:37.620
Oh, you're just too marvelous.

388
00:38:44.304 --> 00:38:47.000
Okay, Hodges.
Does my baby want brandy?

389
00:38:47.173 --> 00:38:49.107
Anything you say.

390
00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:59.012
-Aren't you gonna have some?
-Oh, no. I never drink.

391
00:38:59.185 --> 00:39:00.709
Oh, come on.

392
00:39:00.887 --> 00:39:04.414
Well, maybe just a sip of yours.

393
00:39:11.798 --> 00:39:13.561
Isn't this cozy?

394
00:39:13.733 --> 00:39:17.726
You know, sometimes your little girl
gets awful lonesome here all by herself.

395
00:39:17.904 --> 00:39:19.769
Oh, my dear.

396
00:39:22.542 --> 00:39:25.204
I wish you'd get rid of
that fantastic colored girl.

397
00:39:25.378 --> 00:39:29.041
-No, Chico stays.
-All right, all right, all right.

398
00:39:29.215 --> 00:39:31.809
How would you like to have
a nice grand piano in this room?

399
00:39:31.985 --> 00:39:34.920
Thanks, no pianos.
I used to hear one all day long.

400
00:39:35.088 --> 00:39:37.318
Why, did somebody in your home
play the piano?

401
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:40.015
Anybody that had a nickel.

402
00:39:41.061 --> 00:39:43.495
Oh, I was only kidding.

403
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:47.962
Of course, if Fuzzy-Wuzzy
really wants to give me something...

404
00:39:48.134 --> 00:39:51.160
...he could put a few more pennies
in my bank account.

405
00:39:51.338 --> 00:39:55.468
My dear, ask me something difficult.

406
00:39:57.243 --> 00:39:59.734
So nice seeing you back at work again.

407
00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.011
Bye, darling.

408
00:40:45.258 --> 00:40:47.988
Schuyler 3-2215.

409
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.160
Miss Powers' apartment, please.

410
00:40:53.666 --> 00:40:55.031
What?

411
00:40:55.201 --> 00:40:57.999
I'm calling Miss Lily Powers' apartment.

412
00:40:59.172 --> 00:41:01.106
Well, how long ago?

413
00:41:01.441 --> 00:41:03.136
Two weeks?

414
00:41:03.476 --> 00:41:06.968
Well, she must have left
a forwarding address.

415
00:41:30.336 --> 00:41:33.396
-Merry Christmas, Miss Powers.
-Thanks.

416
00:41:33.573 --> 00:41:35.200
Merry Christmas to you.

417
00:41:35.375 --> 00:41:38.811
Oh, thank you. Aren't you going out
for Christmas dinner?

418
00:41:40.113 --> 00:41:41.740
No.

419
00:41:52.859 --> 00:41:55.123
You shouldn't have gave
the servants the day off.

420
00:41:55.295 --> 00:41:57.763
-I hate to leave you all alone.
-Oh, I don't mind.

421
00:41:57.931 --> 00:42:00.525
Oh, before I forget, Mr. Carter,
he telephoned.

422
00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.726
Said he'd come in this evening
if he could get away from his family.

423
00:42:03.903 --> 00:42:06.133
That'll be just dandy.

424
00:42:06.306 --> 00:42:09.798
-What's this?
-Oh, that? It come while you was out.

425
00:42:09.976 --> 00:42:13.207
It's some books from old Mr. Cragg
back in Erie.

426
00:42:13.379 --> 00:42:16.348
-You run along and have a good time.
-I sliced some turkey for you.

427
00:42:16.516 --> 00:42:19.485
-It's in the icebox.
-Thanks very much.

428
00:42:52.919 --> 00:42:54.716
Well.

429
00:42:55.088 --> 00:42:57.113
Merry Christmas.

430
00:42:57.657 --> 00:43:00.148
I had a terrible time finding you.

431
00:43:00.894 --> 00:43:02.759
-Why didn't you leave word?
-Wait a minute.

432
00:43:02.929 --> 00:43:06.956
You're kind of mixed up, aren't you?
I thought you left town.

433
00:43:07.133 --> 00:43:09.363
Well, what else could I do?

434
00:43:09.536 --> 00:43:10.764
-I was in a--
-Jam?

435
00:43:10.937 --> 00:43:14.634
Well, I won't let you get in another.
See what I mean?

436
00:43:15.608 --> 00:43:19.544
Lily, don't do this to me.
I can't stand it.

437
00:43:19.712 --> 00:43:22.044
-It's been brutal not seeing you.
-Yeah?

438
00:43:22.215 --> 00:43:24.376
Well, you better get used to it.

439
00:43:29.088 --> 00:43:32.023
Listen, I don't owe you a thing.
Whatever I do is my own business.

440
00:43:32.192 --> 00:43:35.559
You never had but one idea about me.
That's all I ever meant to you.

441
00:43:35.795 --> 00:43:37.092
-Lily--
-You made your choice.

442
00:43:37.263 --> 00:43:39.288
Now what do you want?

443
00:43:40.133 --> 00:43:41.725
You mean...

444
00:43:42.001 --> 00:43:45.664
-...I can't see you anymore?
-How did you guess it?

445
00:43:47.006 --> 00:43:49.736
I'm sorry my butler's off today.

446
00:43:49.909 --> 00:43:53.345
I like to have my guests
shown out in style.

447
00:44:08.461 --> 00:44:11.521
But, Ned, I have a right to know.

448
00:44:11.698 --> 00:44:14.166
You haven't been to see Anne
since Christmas.

449
00:44:14.334 --> 00:44:17.201
And it's obvious to everyone
that you're neglecting your work.

450
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:19.998
-Now, what's the matter?
-I'll tell you. Why not?

451
00:44:20.173 --> 00:44:22.869
I can't get along without her.
She's on my mind all the time.

452
00:44:23.042 --> 00:44:24.942
-Who do you mean?
-I mean, the girl.

453
00:44:25.111 --> 00:44:26.339
I saw her Christmas Day.

454
00:44:26.512 --> 00:44:29.174
It's my fault what's happened!
I can't stand the thought!

455
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:31.476
Some man is keeping her!

456
00:44:31.985 --> 00:44:34.215
But are you sure of that?

457
00:44:34.387 --> 00:44:36.855
Feeling the way I do,
I have no right to see Anne again.

458
00:44:37.023 --> 00:44:40.515
That means I'm through here at the bank.
All right, that's all there is to it.

459
00:44:59.545 --> 00:45:03.208
It's the sweetest New Year's present
I ever got.

460
00:45:05.184 --> 00:45:08.745
Sit down. I like to look at you.

461
00:45:12.659 --> 00:45:15.560
I'm sorry, Miss Powers is not at home.

462
00:45:16.062 --> 00:45:18.223
I told you Miss Powers is not at home.

463
00:45:18.398 --> 00:45:21.925
-I know she's here.
-I say, look here! Where are you going?

464
00:45:23.136 --> 00:45:24.728
What's that?

465
00:45:29.342 --> 00:45:31.810
-What do you want?
-I want you to come with me.

466
00:45:31.978 --> 00:45:34.242
-Now. We're going to be married.
-You're drunk.

467
00:45:34.414 --> 00:45:37.941
I know what I'm doing. It's the only way.
I can't go on without you!

468
00:45:38.117 --> 00:45:40.711
So you wanna marry me, huh?

469
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.945
Isn't that beautiful.

470
00:45:43.122 --> 00:45:45.147
-Get out of here or--
-You've got to marry me!

471
00:45:45.325 --> 00:45:46.986
If you don't, I'll kill myself.

472
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.620
-Stop acting.
-No, I mean it! So help me, I'll kill myself!

473
00:45:56.703 --> 00:45:59.365
I told you to get out of here.

474
00:46:06.045 --> 00:46:07.273
Why, you--

475
00:47:25.458 --> 00:47:27.949
There's been an accident here.

476
00:47:28.394 --> 00:47:30.760
You'd better call the police.

477
00:48:02.395 --> 00:48:06.422
I tell you, gentlemen,
not in my 50 years of banking...

478
00:48:06.599 --> 00:48:09.796
...has this institution been implicated
in such a scandal.

479
00:48:09.969 --> 00:48:13.996
So with a scandal on top of us
and a blast of dangerous notoriety...

480
00:48:14.173 --> 00:48:17.472
...that's shaken the people's confidence
in our bank, what do you do?

481
00:48:17.643 --> 00:48:19.941
You demand the president's resignation...

482
00:48:20.112 --> 00:48:22.410
...and break your necks
to elect a new president.

483
00:48:22.582 --> 00:48:26.985
A playboy who hasn't had
a day's banking experience in his life.

484
00:48:27.153 --> 00:48:31.249
How do you expect a society globetrotter
to restore confidence?

485
00:48:31.424 --> 00:48:34.587
Perhaps you've forgotten
that his grandfather founded this bank.

486
00:48:34.927 --> 00:48:38.192
In this emergency, the Trenholm name
is the greatest asset we could have.

487
00:48:38.364 --> 00:48:41.162
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Trenholm is here.

488
00:48:43.536 --> 00:48:45.299
He's on his way in, gentlemen.

489
00:48:45.471 --> 00:48:47.769
And I needn't remind you
how essential it is...

490
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.137
...that we give him our undivided loyalty
and support.

491
00:48:52.879 --> 00:48:54.107
Good morning.

492
00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.772
-I hope I haven't kept you waiting.
-Mr. Trenholm, my congratulations.

493
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:59.440
-Thank you, sir.
-Well, Courtland.

494
00:48:59.619 --> 00:49:01.519
I'm delighted to see you,
Mr. Vanderleur.

495
00:49:01.687 --> 00:49:04.281
Your grandfather would have been
proud to see you here.

496
00:49:04.457 --> 00:49:05.822
That's very kind of you, sir.

497
00:49:05.992 --> 00:49:07.857
-Morning, Courtland.
-Hello, Jameson.

498
00:49:08.027 --> 00:49:09.551
-Well.
-Good morning.

499
00:49:09.729 --> 00:49:11.993
Well, I'm glad to see you,
Mr. Gault. I....

500
00:49:12.164 --> 00:49:14.689
Gentlemen, I shan't take up your time...

501
00:49:14.867 --> 00:49:17.267
...telling you how much
I appreciate this honor.

502
00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:22.234
Some of you probably thing I should stick
to polo and not try to run a bank.

503
00:49:22.408 --> 00:49:25.502
But I'm sure that with your help,
I can't go very far wrong.

504
00:49:42.995 --> 00:49:45.054
Gentlemen, the first thing
we have to decide...

505
00:49:45.231 --> 00:49:47.529
...is what we're going to do
about this Lily Powers.

506
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.930
The Record has offered her
$10,000 for her story.

507
00:49:50.102 --> 00:49:52.900
That must be stopped.
The thing to do is to send for the girl.

508
00:49:53.072 --> 00:49:56.564
I told her to be here at 10:00.

509
00:50:02.882 --> 00:50:04.349
Quite on time.

510
00:50:04.517 --> 00:50:06.041
Come in.

511
00:50:11.257 --> 00:50:13.384
-Sit here, please.
-Thank you.

512
00:50:13.559 --> 00:50:16.528
Now, Courtland, will you...?

513
00:50:19.332 --> 00:50:21.960
Miss Powers, we understand
that one of the newspapers...

514
00:50:22.134 --> 00:50:25.160
...has offered you a sum of money
for a story by you...

515
00:50:25.338 --> 00:50:28.068
...touching on this unfortunate affair.

516
00:50:28.407 --> 00:50:30.739
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

517
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:33.936
May I ask what sort of a story it is?

518
00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.239
Why, it's my diary.

519
00:50:37.316 --> 00:50:38.544
You kept a diary?

520
00:50:38.784 --> 00:50:42.447
Well, just my experiences
here at the bank.

521
00:50:42.622 --> 00:50:43.884
I see.

522
00:50:44.457 --> 00:50:46.288
And you're willing
to have them published?

523
00:50:46.459 --> 00:50:49.257
Oh, I couldn't bear to do it
except that I'm desperate.

524
00:50:49.428 --> 00:50:50.861
I know what the world thinks.

525
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:54.397
Everyone blames me.
No one knows the truth.

526
00:50:54.567 --> 00:50:57.195
I was all alone here.
No family, no friends.

527
00:50:57.370 --> 00:51:00.430
I was working hard,
earning my own living.

528
00:51:00.606 --> 00:51:02.267
And then....

529
00:51:02.475 --> 00:51:05.342
-And then Baby came.
-Baby?

530
00:51:06.345 --> 00:51:08.643
That's what I always called Mr. Carter.

531
00:51:13.853 --> 00:51:17.186
I was a victim of circumstance.
No one will ever know what I went through.

532
00:51:17.356 --> 00:51:20.621
And then this terrible thing.
I couldn't believe it had happened.

533
00:51:20.893 --> 00:51:23.123
Now I'm disgraced
for the rest of my life.

534
00:51:23.295 --> 00:51:25.559
There's nothing left for me
to do but to go away...

535
00:51:25.731 --> 00:51:28.723
...where nobody knows me
and try and start all over again.

536
00:51:29.835 --> 00:51:31.928
I don't wanna sell this story
to the papers.

537
00:51:32.104 --> 00:51:33.765
I wouldn't hurt anyone for the world.

538
00:51:34.273 --> 00:51:37.674
I wish I could tear it up now
before anybody reads it, but I can't.

539
00:51:37.843 --> 00:51:40.141
I must have money to go away.

540
00:51:40.646 --> 00:51:44.514
All I want is a chance
to earn an honest living.

541
00:51:47.019 --> 00:51:50.477
Gentlemen, I think
there's only one thing to do:

542
00:51:50.656 --> 00:51:54.558
Give Miss Powers a check for $10,000
to turn her story over to us.

543
00:51:54.727 --> 00:51:56.217
Oh, it's 15,000.

544
00:51:56.395 --> 00:51:59.159
Oh, didn't the paper offer you 10?

545
00:51:59.398 --> 00:52:01.525
Yes, but I've been figuring things up...

546
00:52:01.701 --> 00:52:04.966
...and I don't see how I could possibly
let it go for less than 15,000.

547
00:52:05.137 --> 00:52:07.867
Well, we won't quibble
over a few thousand dollars.

548
00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.769
Are we all agreed, gentlemen?

549
00:52:10.176 --> 00:52:11.734
-I agree.
-That's the thing to do.

550
00:52:11.911 --> 00:52:15.244
-Then we're agreed on that.
-Just a moment, please.

551
00:52:16.348 --> 00:52:19.840
Miss Powers, no one could help
but be moved by your story.

552
00:52:20.019 --> 00:52:23.546
It's obvious, as you say,
that you were a victim of circumstance.

553
00:52:23.723 --> 00:52:25.623
You have our sympathy.

554
00:52:25.791 --> 00:52:30.285
Of course, any talk of money must be
very distressing to a sensitive person.

555
00:52:30.563 --> 00:52:35.330
You've told us how distasteful it would be
for you to accept money from a paper.

556
00:52:35.501 --> 00:52:39.699
I'm afraid it would be equally distasteful
to accept money from the bank.

557
00:52:39.939 --> 00:52:43.602
Perhaps we've been somewhat crude
in our suggestion.

558
00:52:45.344 --> 00:52:48.609
You also told us
how hard you had to work.

559
00:52:49.115 --> 00:52:53.518
When this thing happened,
were you working very hard?

560
00:52:53.686 --> 00:52:56.177
Yeah, but not at the bank.

561
00:52:57.256 --> 00:52:59.121
Oh, I see.

562
00:52:59.425 --> 00:53:03.657
You also told us that all you wanted
was a chance to earn an honest living.

563
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:08.289
To get away where nobody knew you
and where you could start life over again.

564
00:53:08.467 --> 00:53:10.731
That is what you said,
isn't it, Miss Powers?

565
00:53:11.737 --> 00:53:13.204
Yes, that's what I said.

566
00:53:13.639 --> 00:53:15.834
Very well, we'll give you what you want.

567
00:53:16.008 --> 00:53:19.171
We'll pay your passage to Paris,
and when you arrive there...

568
00:53:19.345 --> 00:53:22.576
...you'll find a position waiting for you
in our Paris branch.

569
00:53:22.748 --> 00:53:24.943
No doubt, you'll want
to change your name.

570
00:53:25.117 --> 00:53:28.109
That can all be arranged for you
in strict confidence.

571
00:53:28.287 --> 00:53:29.811
Is that satisfactory, Miss Powers?

572
00:53:31.957 --> 00:53:34.289
-I guess so.
-Splendid.

573
00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:36.189
-Did you put all that down?
-Yes, sir.

574
00:53:36.495 --> 00:53:39.623
Arrange transportation for Miss Powers
on the first boat sailing.

575
00:53:39.799 --> 00:53:42.233
Well, I think that's all,
isn't it, gentlemen?

576
00:53:42.401 --> 00:53:44.528
Thank you, Miss Powers.

577
00:53:44.703 --> 00:53:48.002
You'll like Paris.
It's delightful in the springtime.

578
00:53:49.675 --> 00:53:51.199
Yeah?

579
00:53:51.377 --> 00:53:53.504
You think of everything, don't you?

580
00:54:25.511 --> 00:54:28.844
Of course, if I go to Berlin,
the food there is very fattening.

581
00:54:29.014 --> 00:54:31.505
Well, you could go to Carlsbad
afterward and reduce.

582
00:54:31.684 --> 00:54:33.982
The very thing!
Could you arrange it for me?

583
00:54:34.153 --> 00:54:36.747
I'll have the tickets sent to your hotel,
Mrs. Hemingway.

584
00:54:36.922 --> 00:54:38.981
-Would you care to look this over?
-Thank you.

585
00:54:39.158 --> 00:54:40.648
You're welcome.

586
00:54:40.826 --> 00:54:43.351
Would you look after this, Miss Allen?

587
00:54:43.529 --> 00:54:48.023
-Changed your mind about dinner tonight?
-I'm still not hungry.

588
00:54:50.302 --> 00:54:53.738
-My boy, I think she's crazy about you.
-Oh, I don't get her at all.

589
00:54:53.906 --> 00:54:56.238
What does she do for a good time?
She never goes out.

590
00:54:56.408 --> 00:54:59.172
Come on, boys. Try and give
the appearance of working, anyhow.

591
00:54:59.345 --> 00:55:02.007
We've got to make a good impression
on Mr. Trenholm.

592
00:55:03.148 --> 00:55:06.811
Oh, dear, I'm so nervous. All this fuss
and excitement over Mr. Trenholm.

593
00:55:06.986 --> 00:55:09.477
I do hope he doesn't start firing people
right and left.

594
00:55:09.655 --> 00:55:11.885
The last time the president came--

595
00:55:19.732 --> 00:55:21.597
When do you think the loan
will be decided?

596
00:55:21.767 --> 00:55:23.394
Oh, possibly in about two days.

597
00:55:24.003 --> 00:55:28.201
Then I shall take myself to Nice
for a much needed rest.

598
00:55:30.476 --> 00:55:32.239
Well.

599
00:55:37.249 --> 00:55:39.114
I didn't expect to find you here.

600
00:55:40.953 --> 00:55:44.548
-I know you didn't.
-Miss Allen has done very well.

601
00:55:44.723 --> 00:55:46.714
We've put her in charge
of our travel bureau.

602
00:55:46.892 --> 00:55:48.519
Really? I'm glad to hear it.

603
00:55:48.694 --> 00:55:51.857
Oh, by the way, this department
has increased its business...

604
00:55:52.031 --> 00:55:54.795
...over 40 percent
since the first of the year.

605
00:56:19.959 --> 00:56:21.290
-Going my way?
-No, thanks.

606
00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.793
-Well, you don't know which is my way.
-Anyhow, I'm not going that way.

607
00:56:24.964 --> 00:56:27.194
Well, good night.

608
00:56:50.823 --> 00:56:52.051
How are you liking Paris?

609
00:56:52.224 --> 00:56:55.716
Oh, it's very nice, except that you
can't get a taxi when it rains.

610
00:56:55.894 --> 00:56:57.191
Could I drop you?

611
00:56:57.363 --> 00:57:00.662
-I'm afraid that would be too much trouble.
-No trouble.

612
00:57:00.833 --> 00:57:02.596
Thank you.

613
00:57:19.918 --> 00:57:22.011
Frankly, I am surprised.

614
00:57:22.187 --> 00:57:23.677
Why?

615
00:57:23.856 --> 00:57:26.120
I didn't expect you to stick to the job.

616
00:57:27.092 --> 00:57:29.390
That's why I stuck.

617
00:57:31.563 --> 00:57:36.557
One might imagine that you'd find
this business life rather dull.

618
00:57:36.735 --> 00:57:41.138
One might imagine that you know
practically nothing about me.

619
00:57:42.941 --> 00:57:45.739
Still, it would have been easy for you
to come here to Paris...

620
00:57:45.911 --> 00:57:48.937
...and have a somewhat gayer time.

621
00:57:49.114 --> 00:57:53.517
It would have been too easy.
That's what you expected me to do.

622
00:57:54.286 --> 00:57:57.187
Does it annoy you to find out
that you're wrong about something?

623
00:57:57.356 --> 00:57:59.483
Or were you ever wrong before?

624
00:57:59.658 --> 00:58:04.061
Well, you must admit
that our first meeting was rather formal.

625
00:58:05.931 --> 00:58:08.399
Oh, this is as far as I go.

626
00:58:09.501 --> 00:58:10.991
So this is where you live, huh?

627
00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:15.732
All the charm of the Old World
and the Old World plumbing.

628
00:58:20.479 --> 00:58:23.505
I'm sure your apartment is attractive.

629
00:58:24.516 --> 00:58:27.349
I wouldn't want you to be disappointed.

630
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:32.120
-Thanks so much. Good night.
-Good night.

631
00:58:49.908 --> 00:58:52.706
Oh, it's one of those pink envelopes.
I knew it.

632
00:58:52.878 --> 00:58:55.779
These big executives always begin
cutting down the office force.

633
00:58:55.948 --> 00:58:59.213
Oh, I never thought
they'd let you go, though, dearie.

634
00:59:11.697 --> 00:59:15.098
-Did they give you a week's notice?
-No.

635
00:59:16.034 --> 00:59:18.332
Just a few hours.

636
01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.918
-Darling!
-Oh, Aunt Julia.

637
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:12.920
We just few over from London.

638
01:00:13.091 --> 01:00:15.150
I saw you dancing
with this ravishing creature.

639
01:00:15.327 --> 01:00:17.022
This is my aunt, Lady Montroyd.

640
01:00:17.196 --> 01:00:19.187
-How do you do, my dear?
-How do you do?

641
01:00:19.464 --> 01:00:22.126
-Courtland, old boy.
-Hello, Harry.

642
01:00:22.301 --> 01:00:24.565
Harry simply dragged me here
with the delusion...

643
01:00:24.736 --> 01:00:28.570
-...that Miss Allen might dance with him.
-Do you know the Duke of Pom-plum?

644
01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:32.506
Courtland always finds
the most devastating girls.

645
01:00:32.678 --> 01:00:35.238
But if you get bored,
you come along, join us later.

646
01:00:35.414 --> 01:00:37.109
Oh, that would be jolly.

647
01:00:37.516 --> 01:00:40.383
Well, if I don't see you later,
and I don't suppose I shall...

648
01:00:40.552 --> 01:00:43.612
-...take me to lunch tomorrow, dear.
-I will, Aunt Julia. Good night.

649
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:45.723
Miss Allen, would you
honor me with a dance?

650
01:00:45.891 --> 01:00:48.223
-Take Harry with you.
-I've been looking forward to it.

651
01:00:48.393 --> 01:00:50.759
-Come along, you little man. Good night.
-Good night.

652
01:00:50.929 --> 01:00:53.762
-Good night.
-Good night.

653
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.333
Well, my evening's a social success.
Dukes and ladies.

654
01:00:58.503 --> 01:01:01.267
Don't tell me the king of Spain
is going to jump out of a pie.

655
01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.067
You mustn't be snobbish.

656
01:01:03.242 --> 01:01:07.042
Beneath their rough exteriors,
they really have hearts of platinum.

657
01:01:07.913 --> 01:01:10.711
Are you really thinking
or just pretending to?

658
01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:14.546
That's the nice part of being
with a mastermind...

659
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.245
...you do the thinking for both of us.

660
01:01:20.592 --> 01:01:22.924
Then you're coming to Deauville?

661
01:01:25.597 --> 01:01:27.064
Deauville's too crowded.

662
01:01:28.433 --> 01:01:30.424
How about Biarritz?

663
01:01:30.702 --> 01:01:34.160
-Not crowded enough.
-I'll tell you what.

664
01:01:34.339 --> 01:01:36.637
Would you like to motor through
the chateau country?

665
01:01:36.808 --> 01:01:40.300
And see all those lovely
14th-century ceilings?

666
01:01:41.146 --> 01:01:42.545
You're hard to please.

667
01:01:43.382 --> 01:01:45.748
No, I'm not, really.

668
01:01:45.917 --> 01:01:47.384
Just a little disappointed.

669
01:01:47.886 --> 01:01:49.513
Disappointed?

670
01:01:49.688 --> 01:01:52.555
-In what?
-You.

671
01:01:53.558 --> 01:01:57.153
-Why?
-Oh, I don't know.

672
01:01:57.329 --> 01:02:00.856
I was hoping you wouldn't be
like everybody else.

673
01:02:01.199 --> 01:02:03.167
Silly of me, wasn't it?

674
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:07.937
Well, I'm disappointed in myself.

675
01:02:11.343 --> 01:02:14.107
Because you're beginning to upset me.

676
01:02:35.567 --> 01:02:37.091
Darling...

677
01:02:37.803 --> 01:02:40.101
...how long is this going on?

678
01:02:40.439 --> 01:02:41.667
Aren't you happy?

679
01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.900
These have been the three
happiest days of my life, but--

680
01:02:45.077 --> 01:02:46.840
But what?

681
01:02:47.779 --> 01:02:50.714
Well, I don't enjoy saying good night
to you every night...

682
01:02:50.882 --> 01:02:53.476
...outside the door of your stateroom.

683
01:02:54.186 --> 01:02:55.847
It's funny.

684
01:02:56.021 --> 01:02:59.286
-Well, what's funny about it?
-Oh, I was just thinking.

685
01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:02.894
There's not much difference being
on a yacht or on the Albany night boat.

686
01:03:03.061 --> 01:03:05.359
You fool, don't you realize
I'm in love with you?

687
01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:07.930
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

688
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.934
I can't wait to get back to Paris
to buy you all the jewels in Cartier's.

689
01:03:12.104 --> 01:03:15.596
To take you to the motor salons, where
you can pick out any car that you like.

690
01:03:15.774 --> 01:03:18.572
I want to give you a house in Paris
and another in New York.

691
01:03:18.744 --> 01:03:21.736
There isn't anything in the world
I wouldn't give you.

692
01:03:22.114 --> 01:03:26.278
-That isn't love.
-I'm mad about you, and you know it.

693
01:03:26.451 --> 01:03:29.045
There's only one thing I want.

694
01:03:29.221 --> 01:03:30.745
Name it, and it's yours.

695
01:03:31.456 --> 01:03:35.324
I'd like to have a "Mrs."
on my tombstone.

696
01:03:39.297 --> 01:03:42.494
I never thought of marriage seriously.

697
01:03:42.667 --> 01:03:46.763
It needn't last forever.
You could divorce me in two weeks.

698
01:03:46.938 --> 01:03:49.839
-Yes, but I--
-Oh, it's all right.

699
01:03:50.008 --> 01:03:51.942
Forget about it.

700
01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:54.904
I just thought I'd mention it.

701
01:03:57.215 --> 01:03:59.308
Are you going to miss me?

702
01:03:59.684 --> 01:04:01.515
What do you mean?

703
01:04:01.787 --> 01:04:04.017
I'm leaving in the morning.

704
01:04:20.005 --> 01:04:21.495
Great Scott!

705
01:04:21.673 --> 01:04:23.834
Did you see this?

706
01:04:25.977 --> 01:04:29.572
This is a fine mess
with the condition the bank's in.

707
01:04:32.684 --> 01:04:37.986
Hello, hello. This is transatlantic operator
number 16 calling Élysées 6142, Paris.

708
01:04:38.156 --> 01:04:40.147
Hello, hello.

709
01:04:40.325 --> 01:04:43.260
Hello, hello. Monsieur Trenholm?

710
01:04:43.428 --> 01:04:47.694
Transatlantic operator
is calling you from New York.

711
01:04:48.767 --> 01:04:51.133
Go ahead, they are ready to talk.

712
01:04:52.137 --> 01:04:53.832
Yes?

713
01:04:54.439 --> 01:04:56.634
Oh, hello, Mr. Jameson.

714
01:05:01.046 --> 01:05:02.570
What?

715
01:05:03.748 --> 01:05:05.739
Are you sure?

716
01:05:06.718 --> 01:05:08.447
Yes.

717
01:05:09.087 --> 01:05:11.920
All right, I'll come immediately.

718
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:14.688
Yes, thank you.

719
01:05:18.096 --> 01:05:22.226
I'm sorry, dear, but we've got to go
right back to New York.

720
01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.595
Is anything wrong?

721
01:05:25.604 --> 01:05:27.663
I'm afraid so.

722
01:05:28.006 --> 01:05:30.304
They want me at the bank.

723
01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:14.109
If you'd listened,
this wouldn't have happened.

724
01:06:14.286 --> 01:06:16.379
Will you stop blaming Trenholm?

725
01:06:16.621 --> 01:06:18.486
-It isn't his fault.
-When a bank closes...

726
01:06:18.657 --> 01:06:20.648
...because of mismanagement,
who is to blame?

727
01:06:20.825 --> 01:06:22.292
All of us are to blame.

728
01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:27.591
-You can't hold one person responsible.
-Rot! You'll see who's held responsible.

729
01:06:36.041 --> 01:06:37.303
Courtland.

730
01:06:37.475 --> 01:06:40.467
-Mr. Jameson.
-Well, Courtland.

731
01:06:46.918 --> 01:06:50.513
Hi, special extra here:
Trenholm indicted!

732
01:06:50.689 --> 01:06:52.657
Hi, paper here!

733
01:06:52.824 --> 01:06:54.348
Hi, special extra here!

734
01:06:54.526 --> 01:06:57.222
Read all about it.
Trenholm indicted!

735
01:06:57.395 --> 01:06:59.659
Hi, all about the big bank failure!

736
01:06:59.831 --> 01:07:04.461
Hi, special extra here:
Trenholm indicted!

737
01:07:46.678 --> 01:07:50.580
-Hasn't Mr. Trenholm called yet?
-No.

738
01:07:52.384 --> 01:07:55.478
Bring me that pigskin case on the bed.

739
01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:07.158
-Know what's in this bag?
-No.

740
01:08:12.637 --> 01:08:14.935
Half a million dollars.

741
01:08:16.007 --> 01:08:18.441
Someday I'll have the other half
that goes with it.

742
01:08:18.610 --> 01:08:22.376
You sure will. You can get anything
you put your mind on.

743
01:08:46.504 --> 01:08:48.438
What's the matter?

744
01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:50.298
The bank's gone.

745
01:08:50.475 --> 01:08:53.842
I've been indicted. They released me
on a half a million dollars' bail.

746
01:08:54.012 --> 01:08:55.843
Bail? But what can they do to you?

747
01:08:56.047 --> 01:08:59.949
Why, they're preparing another indictment.
I've got to fight it. It'll take money.

748
01:09:00.118 --> 01:09:02.484
I've got to raise a million dollars tonight.

749
01:09:04.089 --> 01:09:06.114
You'll have to help me.

750
01:09:06.624 --> 01:09:08.888
I'll need everything I've given you...

751
01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.688
...all your bonds and securities.

752
01:09:12.363 --> 01:09:14.695
You have everything here, haven't you?

753
01:09:16.434 --> 01:09:18.925
Well, haven't you?

754
01:09:21.272 --> 01:09:23.069
I....

755
01:09:27.245 --> 01:09:28.940
I can't do it.

756
01:09:29.481 --> 01:09:31.278
What do you mean?

757
01:09:31.449 --> 01:09:33.940
Lily, you've got to stick with me.

758
01:09:34.119 --> 01:09:35.950
You're all I have left.

759
01:09:36.121 --> 01:09:38.453
Together we can fight this thing.

760
01:09:38.623 --> 01:09:40.181
You've got to help me.

761
01:09:41.626 --> 01:09:43.025
No, I....

762
01:09:43.661 --> 01:09:45.822
I can't do it.

763
01:09:45.997 --> 01:09:48.158
I have to think of myself.

764
01:09:48.333 --> 01:09:50.927
I've gone through a lot
to get those things.

765
01:09:51.102 --> 01:09:55.198
My life has been bitter and hard.
I'm not like other women.

766
01:09:55.373 --> 01:09:58.570
All the gentleness and kindness in me
has been killed.

767
01:09:58.743 --> 01:10:01.871
All I've got are those things.
Without them, I'd be nothing.

768
01:10:02.046 --> 01:10:04.776
I'd have to go back to what I was.

769
01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:06.945
No.

770
01:10:08.286 --> 01:10:10.584
I won't give them up.

771
01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:21.694
Chico, put those things back.

772
01:10:21.866 --> 01:10:23.993
Pack your trunks again.

773
01:10:24.435 --> 01:10:26.562
We're sailing tonight.

774
01:10:27.806 --> 01:10:32.470
Send all my luggage to the French Line pier
and get down there as quickly as you can.

775
01:10:49.828 --> 01:10:52.353
I don't know, but thank you.

776
01:11:35.907 --> 01:11:39.638
I know you've known men before me.
Probably more than one.

777
01:11:39.811 --> 01:11:42.575
But I don't care.
It doesn't make any difference.

778
01:11:42.747 --> 01:11:46.046
I love you, and someday
I'm going to make you love me.

779
01:12:34.699 --> 01:12:36.997
Oh, stop that!

780
01:12:47.612 --> 01:12:49.580
Now, be careful.

781
01:13:03.928 --> 01:13:05.657
Thank you.

782
01:13:10.101 --> 01:13:13.832
-Is Mr. Trenholm still here?
-I think so, ma'am.

783
01:13:29.387 --> 01:13:31.082
Courtland.

784
01:13:34.525 --> 01:13:36.459
Courtland!

785
01:13:40.832 --> 01:13:42.993
Courtland!

786
01:13:51.943 --> 01:13:53.535
You didn't find him, ma'am?

787
01:13:53.711 --> 01:13:56.043
-Maybe he's down in his office.
-Oh, take me there.

788
01:13:56.214 --> 01:13:59.149
Sometimes they work late, you know.

789
01:14:12.764 --> 01:14:14.527
Courtland.

790
01:14:14.799 --> 01:14:17.029
Get a doctor, quick.

791
01:14:19.537 --> 01:14:21.664
Oh, darling.

792
01:14:23.474 --> 01:14:25.237
Darling, don't leave me.

793
01:14:26.244 --> 01:14:29.907
I'll do anything for you. Anything.

794
01:14:30.681 --> 01:14:33.514
Don't go away from me, please.

795
01:14:34.185 --> 01:14:36.676
Oh, I love you so much.

796
01:14:36.854 --> 01:14:38.981
I love you.

797
01:14:39.657 --> 01:14:42.922
I've never said that before to any man.

798
01:14:43.227 --> 01:14:45.787
I never knew what it meant.

799
01:14:46.364 --> 01:14:48.525
Oh, darling.

800
01:14:48.699 --> 01:14:51.600
You can have everything I've got.

801
01:14:51.803 --> 01:14:54.294
I'd do anything for you. Anything.

802
01:14:58.543 --> 01:15:00.408
Oh, Courtland.

803
01:15:00.578 --> 01:15:05.675
Don't leave me, Courtland!
Oh, my God, don't leave me!

804
01:15:17.128 --> 01:15:18.755
We've done all we can, lady.

805
01:15:19.163 --> 01:15:20.721
He has a good chance.

806
01:15:28.239 --> 01:15:30.366
Your case slipped, lady.
You better pick it up.

807
01:15:34.312 --> 01:15:36.746
It doesn't matter now.
