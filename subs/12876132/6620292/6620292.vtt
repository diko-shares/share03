I chose that school in Switzerland
for the security.

You chose poorly.

00:27:58.635 --> 00:28:01.923
That whatever the Army did to alter
your biology, your genetics,

360
00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:04.301
<i>was passed on</i> to <i>Joseph?
Of course not.</i>

361
00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:08.180
From what that H.I.V.E. Queen said,
his abilities are very different than mine.

362
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.557
Not physical in nature, psychic.

363
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.771
What?

364
00:28:13.192 --> 00:28:14.603
There were times when I'd...

365
00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:17.146
feel him.

366
00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:21.568
As if he was in the room with me.
But I thought I was just imagining it.

367
00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:24.821
He should have been with you.
How could you just send him away like that?

368
00:28:24.912 --> 00:28:27.028
I did it to keep him safe.

369
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:30.042
- SLADE: I could have kept him safe.
- ADELINE: The way you did last time?

370
00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:33.075
When that animal cut his throat
and left him mute?

371
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.457
You punished me enough
for it, didn't you'?

372
00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:37.333
Locked me out of his life.

373
00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:43.336
And you never once questioned it.
Never once tried to see him.

374
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.797
Another man would have
fought me tooth and nail,

375
00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:47.882
would have begged to
see his son.

376
00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:52.721
But you? One pathetic letter,
and then you were gone forever.

377
00:28:52.814 --> 00:28:53.895
Why?

378
00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:56.519
I always seem to be
asking you that. Why?

379
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.396
The past is dead, Addie,

380
00:28:58.487 --> 00:29:01.070
and nothing we do, nothing we say,
can change it.

381

- "We"?

You're not going after him
alone this time.

385

I'm going with you.

Oh, I remember.

388
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:19.209
He broke me.
Humiliated me.

389
00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:20.630

<i>What a gift.</i>

710
00:51:48.522 --> 00:51:50.012
ROSE: <i>It was a curse.</i>

711
00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:57.691
JACKAL: <i>I suppose it was at first.</i>

712
00:51:59.908 --> 00:52:00.989
<i>But then...</i>

713
00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:05.111
<i>I found you.</i>

714
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:09.248
Took you under my wing,
trained you,

715
00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:11.121
became the father you never had.

716
00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:13.077
Made you a queen.

717
00:52:13.172 --> 00:52:16.210
And now, you'll make your
brother a king.

718
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.008
- And together...
- We'll rule the world?

719
00:52:19.094 --> 00:52:22.177
No. We'll rule the rulers.

720
00:52:22.264 --> 00:52:24.471
So much better that way.

721
00:52:24.558 --> 00:52:27.300
Project Jericho launches in
ten days, Rose.

722
00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:30.512
I have my final preparations
to see to and you have yours.

723
00:52:31.106 --> 00:52:32.106
Be ready.

724
00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:34.724
Will I see you then?

725
00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:36.684
It's been more than a year.

726
00:52:36.779 --> 00:52:39.146
You know I have to remain
in seclusion.

727
00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:42.152
No one can know where the H.I.V.E. Lord is.
Not even you.

728
00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:44.404
But this, child,

729
00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:46.202
I wouldn't miss for the world.

730
00:52:52.628 --> 00:52:53.789
JOSEPH: <i>You okay?</i>

731
00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:58.255
I am now.

732
00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:06.176
SLADE: I didn't know Lillian
was pregnant.

733
00:53:06.266 --> 00:53:07.677
She never told me.

734
00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:10.248
- If I had known...
- You would've been the father to that girl

735
00:53:10.312 --> 00:53:12.178
that you were to Joseph?

736
00:53:13.107 --> 00:53:15.690
Years ago, when you told
me about Lillian,

737
00:53:15.776 --> 00:53:17.892
you said she didn't
mean anything to you.

738
00:53:19.446 --> 00:53:20.446
Was that true?

739
00:53:20.989 --> 00:53:23.856
She didn't.
Not like you, Addie.

740
00:53:23.951 --> 00:53:27.535
- But?
- After I realized what had happened to me...

741
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:30.617
what the army
had turned me into, I felt...

742
00:53:30.708 --> 00:53:33.496
lost. Untethered.

743
00:53:33.585 --> 00:53:35.917
I needed time to
sort through things.

744
00:53:36.004 --> 00:53:38.336
So, I traveled.
Looking for...

745
00:53:38.424 --> 00:53:40.335
Something I couldn't give you?

746
00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:43.760
I don't know.
Maybe it was easier turning to a stranger.

747
00:53:43.846 --> 00:53:45.928
Lillian was a good woman.

748
00:53:46.014 --> 00:53:47.675
Sweet. Kind.

749
00:53:47.766 --> 00:53:50.849
- So you did care about her.
- Yes. But not like...

750
00:53:50.936 --> 00:53:53.394
And just left her,
pregnant and alone.

751
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.642
I didn't know about the child.

752
00:53:55.733 --> 00:53:57.573
Would you rather I'd stayed
with her and not...

753
00:53:57.609 --> 00:53:59.441
I'd rather it had
never happened.

754
00:53:59.528 --> 00:54:01.189
It sounds funny,
I know.

755
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.862
But my affair with Lillian,

756
00:54:02.948 --> 00:54:05.736
it's what made me realize
that you were the only one.

757
00:54:05.826 --> 00:54:08.534
- That no other woman could...
- I'm not laughing.

758
00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.533
- I didn't mean it like that.
- What did you mean?

759
00:54:11.623 --> 00:54:13.205
Addie, I.

760
00:54:19.673 --> 00:54:22.210
Doesn't matter now,
does it?

761
00:54:22.843 --> 00:54:25.710
No. Not when you destroyed
our family,

762
00:54:25.804 --> 00:54:27.966
and another one
you didn't even know you had.

763
00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:30.639
That's your forte, isn't it?
Destruction.

764
00:54:30.726 --> 00:54:33.093
If you feel that way, then why the hell
are you helping me?

765
00:54:33.187 --> 00:54:34.769
I'm not helping you.

766
00:54:34.855 --> 00:54:36.220
I'm helping Joseph.

767
00:54:36.315 --> 00:54:37.771
And once this is done,

768
00:54:38.358 --> 00:54:39.439
so are we.

769
00:54:45.824 --> 00:54:48.236
JOSEPH: <i>We did the right thing,
didn't we?</i>

770
00:54:49.077 --> 00:54:50.077
Yes.

771
00:54:50.162 --> 00:54:51.948
Of course, we did.

772
00:54:52.039 --> 00:54:53.950
He was a monster.

773
00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:56.032
He had to die.

774
00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.662
<i>He was a knight once.</i>

775
00:54:57.753 --> 00:54:59.039
What?

776
00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:00.164
<i>N... Nothing.</i>

777
00:55:02.007 --> 00:55:04.499
I know a part of you
still loves them.

778
00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:07.176
You can't help it.

779
00:55:07.262 --> 00:55:11.256
But Slade Wilson
never gave a damn about you.

780
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:13.182
His entire life was a lie.

781
00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:15.434
And your mother,

782
00:55:15.521 --> 00:55:17.432
if she really loved you,

783
00:55:17.523 --> 00:55:20.106
would she have locked you away
in that school,

784
00:55:20.192 --> 00:55:21.978
left you there to rot?

785
00:55:23.529 --> 00:55:25.111
Would she?

786
00:55:25.197 --> 00:55:26.197
<i>No.</i>

787
00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:43.541
We were both so alone, Jericho.

788
00:55:43.632 --> 00:55:45.464
So alone.

789
00:55:45.551 --> 00:55:48.794
But we found each other,
didn't we?

790
00:55:51.223 --> 00:55:54.261
I guess we can thank
Deathstroke for that much.

791
00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:56.467
Years before we ever met,

792
00:55:56.562 --> 00:55:58.599
your mind reached out,

793
00:55:58.689 --> 00:55:59.724
found me.

794
00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:01.556
We knew each other,

795
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:05.769
shared each other's thoughts,
feelings, all our hopes,

796
00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:08.021
all our sorrows.

797
00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:09.981
When this...

798
00:56:10.075 --> 00:56:13.113
this power inside me came alive,

799
00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:15.410
I was so scared, Rose.

800
00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:17.829
I thought it was going
to burn me up,

801
00:56:17.916 --> 00:56:19.532
tear me apart.

802
00:56:19.626 --> 00:56:21.993
But then,
I felt something.

803
00:56:22.087 --> 00:56:23.248
Like...

804
00:56:23.338 --> 00:56:25.750
Like the echo of my own soul.

805
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:27.172
Me.

806
00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:29.750
You.

807
00:56:29.845 --> 00:56:31.586
I think I would have
died without you.

808
00:56:33.557 --> 00:56:35.639
And I would have
died without you.

809
00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:40.390
You see, Jericho,

810
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.812
you don't need a mother
or a father...

811
00:56:45.986 --> 00:56:47.397
when you have me.

812
00:56:51.825 --> 00:56:54.783
JOSEPH: <i>And what about the man
who calls himself your father?</i>

813
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:56.156
<i>What about the Jackal?</i>

814
00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:05.294
Wintergreen, you there?

815
00:57:06.882 --> 00:57:08.247
WINTERGREEN: <i>Always.</i>

816
00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:25.310
Hey, what about the boat?

817
00:57:26.777 --> 00:57:27.812
(BEEPING)

818
00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:30.811
I stole it, anyway.

819
00:57:44.878 --> 00:57:45.959
Bring them in.

820
00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:55.548
Thank you, agents,
for volunteering.

821
00:57:55.639 --> 00:57:57.505
But we didn't volun...

822
00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:02.259
Agent Sanchez,
step forward.

823
00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:08.857
<i>On your knees.</i>

824
00:58:11.363 --> 00:58:12.899
Now her.

825
00:58:15.283 --> 00:58:16.899
<i>Your weapon.</i>

826
00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.665
This is nothing compared to
what's coming.

827
00:58:25.752 --> 00:58:29.586
And if you can't do this,
all our plans are for nothing.

828
00:58:29.673 --> 00:58:31.084
JOSEPH: <i>All right.</i>

829
00:58:34.219 --> 00:58:35.334
<i>Shoot him.</i>

830
00:58:35.429 --> 00:58:36.544
(GUN COCKING)

831
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:50.182
<i>I can't.</i>

832
00:58:54.322 --> 00:58:56.029
Why'd you stop?

833
00:58:56.116 --> 00:58:57.527
<i>It worked,
didn't it?</i>

834
00:58:57.617 --> 00:58:59.483
<i>She would've killed him
on my command.</i>

835
00:58:59.578 --> 00:59:01.410
<i>Why lose a perfectly good agent?</i>

836
00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:03.578
Fine.

837
00:59:03.665 --> 00:59:06.578
Then let's have a show,
shall we?

838
00:59:10.464 --> 00:59:11.829
(ALL GRUNTING)

839
00:59:30.067 --> 00:59:31.523
That's enough, Jericho.

840
00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:41.859
That's enough.

841
00:59:48.293 --> 00:59:49.293
Jericho, stop!

842
00:59:50.003 --> 00:59:51.038
Stop!

843
01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.513
JOSEPH: <i>Oh, God!
Oh, God!</i>

844
01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.766
<i>I'm sorry, Rose.
I don't know what happened!</i>

845
01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:11.722
<i>I couldn't control it! I...</i>

846
01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:14.104
Shh. It's my fault.

847
01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:17.107
I pushed you too far.
Too fast.

848
01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.858
We'll go a little
slower tonight.

849
01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:22.237
<i>Tonight?
But, can't we...</i>

850
01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.863
Tomorrow, then.

851
01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.704
And no more excuses.

852
01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.083
How did you get this?

853
01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:37.631
While you were blundering
into the H.l.V.E. Queen's trap,

854
01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:40.459
I was hacking into their sewers.

855
01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:44.012
SLADE: Jericho.
That's what she called Joseph.

856
01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.997
They're turning our son
into a weapon of war.

857
01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:17.079
Remember what she said?
I'm a handgun, but Joseph's...

858
01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.539
A nuclear bomb.

859
01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:20.294
But not in the way you think.

860
01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:24.470
Those exercises are to help him master
his abilities, focus them.

861
01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:25.556
But the goal?

862
01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.924
A revolution from within.

863
01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:33.013
Imagine if you controlled someone
who could control the minds of others.

864
01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:37.350
Presidents, prime ministers,
despots, kings.

865
01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:39.685
Mind-theft on a global scale.

866
01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:42.897
You could reshape the planet
without firing a single shot.

867
01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:46.985
And we've got ten days to figure out
what their first move is.

868
01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:49.786
SLADE: And it's all because of her.

869
01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:52.410
She used Joseph.
Manipulated him.

870
01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:57.540
<i>You can do this.</i>

871
01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:01.210
<i>I know you're scared, Jericho,</i>

872
01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:03.087
<i>but I believe in you.</i>

873
01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:05.636
<i>As long as we have each other,
little brother,</i>

874
01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.589
<i>there's nothing
we can't accomplish.</i>

875
01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:10.924
<i>We're two parts of a whole.</i>

876
01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.805
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

877
01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:15.354
<i>Never abandon you
the way they did.</i>

878
01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:18.565
<i>We 're family.</i>

879
01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:26.483
Is that manipulation or love?

880
01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:34.205
Thanks, Addie.
I'll take it from here.

881
01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.158
The hell you will!

882
01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.870
You don't get to decide
what I do or don't do.

883
01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:41.456
SLADE: You've risked enough.
This is my job.

884
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:44.507
I lived with risk every damn day
we were married,

885
01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:48.178
only, I never knew it,

Which one do I murder first?

1077
01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:35.319
The girl whose mother
you used for your own pleasure

1078
01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:37.818
and then so casually threw away?

1079
01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:40.616
Or the boy you
so easily abandoned?

You're not the only sinner here.

Take our dear friend Rose,
for instance.

1084
01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:54.080
She's been manipulating
her brother for years.

1085
01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:57.668
Poisoning his mind
against you and Adeline.

1086
01:15:57.762 --> 01:16:01.471
Making sure his only
loyalty was to her.

1087
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:05.471
I told him the truth.
I love Jericho.

1088
01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:08.770
And what's love but another way
to control people?

1089
01:16:08.856 --> 01:16:10.096
No.

1090
01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:16.145
What you did to him was no different
from what I did to you.

1091
01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.854
No.

1092
01:16:17.948 --> 01:16:19.814
God, no!

1093
01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:22.825
It's not the same, Rose.
You're not the same.

1094
01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:27.454
But I did use him. I...

1095
01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:30.158
I didn't mean to,
but I did.

1096
01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:33.995
Just because love isn't perfect,
doesn't mean it isn't real.

1097
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.673
You were there for him,
when I wasn't.

1098
01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:39.342
Not for him.
Not for you.

1100

Say "please."

1102
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:59.188
Please.
They've suffered enough.

1103
