1
00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.172
I'm telling you, Addie,

2
00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:56.504
if we build these factories
in San Miguel,

3
00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.760
the business is going
through the roof.

4
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.888
<i>I'd rather have you
than the money.</i>

5
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.471
<i>You're away too much,
Slade, and</i> I...

6
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.727
<i>You okay?</i>

7
00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.982
When you're home,
when we're all together,

8
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.938
I never even think about it.

9
00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.194
But as soon as you're away, I...

10
00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:31.080
For God's sake, Addie,
Cambodia was years ago.

11
00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.006
Before we were even married.

12
00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.176
<i>We were in love.
We were engaged.</i>

13
00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:38.220
And we've both seen
enough combat

14
00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:40.548
to know that however much
wounds may heal...

15
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:45.394
How could you do this to me?
I trusted you.

16
00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:53.944
...the scars <i>never go away.</i>

17
00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:56.942
Can I talk to him?

18
00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:59.446
I know. I know.

19
00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.779
And I swear to you, Addie,
I haven't lied to you since.

20
00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:04.489
And I will never
lie to you again.

21
00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:06.873
You believe me, don't you?

22
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.496
Of course I do.

23
00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:10.169
- It's just...
- Can I talk?

24
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.626
Somebody <i>wants you.</i>

25
00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:15.674
- I wonder who.
- Hi, Papa.

26
00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.627
Hey, buddy.
Teeth all brushed?

27
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:18.961
Yeah.

28
00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:21.724
Read to me.

29
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.094
I would, Joe,

30
00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:26.052
- but I'm late for a dinner meeting and...
- Just a little.

31
00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:28.770
A little little.

32
00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:29.972
Hm?

33
00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:39.399
"The land was
filled with dragons"

34
00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.109
and the people were afraid.

35
00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:45.572
<i>But the Shining Knight came riding forth
to protect both man and maid.</i>

36
00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:50.081
<i>He faced the fiercest creatures
that the world had ever known.</i>

37
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.161
<i>And he did it without any help.</i>

38
00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.087
<i>He did it all alone.</i>

39
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:58.259
<i>And when his work was done,
the dragons were no more.</i>

40
00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.507
<i>And so the Knight rode on,</i>

41
00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.680
<i>"into legend,
into lore."</i>

42
00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:06.133
<i>And that's it for tonight, kid.</i>

43
00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:08.310
More. Please?

44
00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:10.138
<i>I've gotta go, buddy,</i>

45
00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:11.848
<i>and you've gotta get to sleep.</i>

46
00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:12.942
Okay.

47
00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:16.982
He misses you.

48
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.355
<i>We miss you.</i>

49
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.065
I'll be on the last plane
out tonight.

50
00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.739
I love you, Adeline Wilson.

51
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.073
And I adore you, Slade Wilson.

52
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.717
Under the covers, little soldier.

53
00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.469
Aye-aye, captain.

54
00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.805
Read to me, Mama.

55
00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.102
-But Papa already read you...
Please?

56
00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.807
Don't give me that wide-eyed
innocent routine, mister.

57
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:57.272
Please, Mama?

58
00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.314
Not that one.
That's just for Papa.

59
00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.946
You are clearly the commanding officer
in this family.

60
00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.484
'Night, little soldier.

61
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.982
Good night, Mama.

62
00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:35.119
No need to panic.
You'd be dead already if I wanted it.

63
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.793
What do you want?

64
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.461
Your son.

65
00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:32.132
If you were looking for a helpless victim,
you came to the wrong house.

66
00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:48.984
You're out of practice, Adeline.

67
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.532
From what I've heard,
you were something to behold,

68
00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:56.739
before marriage and motherhood
made you soft.

69
00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:02.207
Leader of an elite squad within
the Green Berets called Team Seven.

70
00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:05.005
You trained Slade Wilson.

71
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.708
Helped make him the killing machine
that he is today.

72
00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:10.464
"Killing machine."

73
00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.546
He's a businessman.

74
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:14.302
Oh, Adeline,

75
00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:16.429
there's so much you don't know.

76
00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.260
Who the hell are you?

77
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.141
The Jackal.

78
00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:39.039
Molina sent you.

79
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.459
El Presidente doesn't like
his generals plotting against him.

80
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.957
He finds revolution distasteful.

81
00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.335
Then go ahead.
Cut my throat.

82
00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.837
You'll never get
out of here alive.

83
00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.134
Of course I will.

84
00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:56.423
- What is this?
- The head of President Molina.

85
00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:58.759
Note the look of surprise
on his face.

86
00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.094
Very similar to how you
look right now.

87
00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.691
I don't understand.

88
00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:08.394
If Molina hired you to
assassinate me, then...

89
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.445
I'm a mercenary,
not an idiot.

90
00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:14.821
Your president was an oppressive fascist
who ground his people into the dirt.

91
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.573
Under his rule,
San Miguel became a cesspool

92
00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.701
of poverty,
hunger and disease,

93
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:23.204
while he just grew richer
and fatter.

94
00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:24.830
Do better, General Suarez.

95
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:26.961
Or this will be you.

96
00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.165
And, oh, yes,

97
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.592
there is the little matter
of my fee.

98
00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:43.471
Which I am delighted to pay.

99
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.108
- Took a few <i>hits, I</i> see.
- It's nothing.

100
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:58.284
<i>Do you ever consider what would happen
to Adeline and Joseph</i>

101
00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.284
<i>if you died on one
of these little jaunts?</i>

102
00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:04.287
<i>You've been doing this for what,
eight years now? Nine?</i>

103
00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:07.665
<i>Maybe it's time to stop being a mercenary
and start being...</i>

104
00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:10.123
I'll need transport ASAP, Wintergreen.

105
00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.957
<i>And you will have it,
old friend.</i>

106
00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:18.593
<i>The older I get,
the more I envy your ability to heal.</i>

107
00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:21.391
<i>The Army certainly got
what they paid for.</i>

108
00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:22.934
And more.

109
00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.284
- It's networking, damn it!
- Agh!

110
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.368
- Will he live?
- Doesn't matter.

111
00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.169
We've failed again.

112
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.756
They said...

113
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.587
They said it was
a miracle I'm still alive.

114
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.844
I told you not to volunteer
for that damn drug trial.

115
00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.214
When they wouldn't even tell you
what it was for, I knew...

116
00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:06.846
It was my choice.
I could have said no.

117
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.601
Then why didn't you?

118
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:10.648
Because they needed me.

119
00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.022
There were only a handful of men
that fit the profile...

120
00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:15.320
And you've always been
a good soldier.

121
00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:17.898
Maybe too good.

122
00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:19.949
They'll be sending me
home in a few days.

123
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.401
And I'm going with you.

124
00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:22.986
But your duties...

125
00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:24.822
I've served my country.

126
00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.702
And done a damn good job of it.

127
00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.080
- But you need me now...
- No.

128
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.161
You've got another 14 months.

129
00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.167
You do what you signed onto do.

130
00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:39.006
Let me try to build a life for myself,
for us.

131
00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:40.929
Then...

132
00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:42.471
Then, if you still want me...

133
00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.800
Why wouldn't I want you?

134
00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.430
I love you, Slade.

135
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.057
We've got plans.

136
00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.934
A whole life ahead of us.

137
00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:52.641
The Army's the only life I've ever known,
Addie.

138
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:55.853
Being that good soldier.
Following orders.

139
00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:58.780
Killing the enemy.

140
00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:01.074
There's more to you than that.

141
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:03.777
I hope so.

142
00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.009
Addie?

143
00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:24.649
Dear God, what happened?

144
00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.229
Where's Joseph?

145
00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:29.407
He said if I called the police,
he'd kill him.

146
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.490
Who? Who did this?

147
00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:35.409
Said it's you he wants.

148
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.036
Who did this?

149
00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:41.081
Who the hell is the Jackal?

150
00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.163
You know who he is!

151
00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:45.464
"I haven't lied to you since,"
you said,

152
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.088
and I will never lie to you again.

153
00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:52.639
- But it's all been nothing but lies, hasn't it?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

154
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.341
Stop!

155
00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:56.893
The Jackal told me everything.

156
00:14:56.979 --> 00:15:00.222
The Army thought the experiment
was a failure,

157
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:04.275
that their drug didn't work.
That's why they discharged you.

158
00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:08.731
But it just took a little time
to turn you into... What did he call you?

159
00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:09.860
Deathstroke.

160
00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.735
I'm a businessman.

161
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.116
That's what I always believed.

162
00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:19.119
Slade Wilson,
a good and decent man,

163
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.951
who loved his wife and son,

164
00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.252
who'd do anything for his family.

165
00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:25.546
But you're a goddamn mercenary.

166
00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:28.671
Selling death to the highest bidder,

167
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.627
and you hid it from me.

168
00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.258
All these years.

169
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.806
Why?

170
00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.063
I'll bring Joseph back.

171
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.892
And I'll bring the Jackal's carcass
back with me.

172
00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:48.229
I don't need you.
We don't need you.

173
00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:49.812
I can do this without you.

174
00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.946
Broken, damn it.

175
00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:55.993
In several places,
from the look of it.

176
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.195
Go.

177
00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:08.298
- When this is over, Addie, we'll talk.
- Don't even try to lie to me again,

178
00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:11.001
you manipulative son of a bitch.

179
00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:13.211
Just bring Joseph home.

180
00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.468
And God help you if you fail.

181
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.137
I never fail.

182
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.122
How's the wife, Wilson?

183
00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:42.665
Show yourself.

184
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.797
I'm right here.

185
00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.379
My son...

186
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.303
Is fine.
Just a bargaining chip.

187
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:58.097
Accept the bargain and
he doesn't get hurt.

188
00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.845
I won't work with H.I.V.E.

189
00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:02.177
So you said the
last time I asked.

190
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:03.807
And I respect that.

191
00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:06.640
Unfortunately, my superiors don't.

192
00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:13.404
They think your skills
would be of great value to us.

193
00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:15.406
You're terrorists.

194
00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:17.734
Equal opportunity murderers.

195
00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:20.069
Selling our services
to the highest bidder,

196
00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:21.620
just like you.

197
00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.244
Only difference is you're small-time.

198
00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:27.669
- H.I.V.E. thinks globally.
- How many innocent people,

199
00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:30.497
women and children
have died at your hands?

200
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:33.800
Honestly,
I've lost count.

201
00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:37.504
But we're all murderers
under the skin, Wilson.

202
00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:40.135
It's just a matter of scale.

203
00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:43.560
Morality is delusion that fools wear
like a comforting cloak.

204
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.097
But you're no fool.
Are you?

205
00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:49.853
A monster perhaps,
but not a fool.

206
00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.309
Monster?

207
00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.361
Yes, I kill for a living.

208
00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:55.814
But only if the cause is right.

209
00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.694
There are lines I won't cross.

210
00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:59.947
I don't know
if the widows and children

211
00:18:00.037 --> 00:18:03.246
of those soldiers you murdered
in San Miguel would agree.

212
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:06.832
We're the same.
Can't you see that?

213
00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:10.162
Men like us pretend
to have hearts and souls.

214
00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.256
But underneath that,

215
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.206
only darkness.

216
00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.047
I...

217
00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:23.345
The answer is no.

218
00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:26.018
Reconsider.

219
00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.172
Enough!

220
00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:04.306
Enough.

221
00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:32.994
You do realize that you've
proven my point.

222
00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:36.127
She was an extraordinary operative.

223
00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:39.834
But clearly not
extraordinary enough.

224
00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.887
Bronze Tiger's skills are legendary.

225
00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:44.756
And look at him.

226
00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:49.601
Give me my boy.

227
00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:52.306
Give me your answer.

228
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.606
Will you join H.I.V.E.?

229
00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:04.735
Or will my man slit little Joseph's throat
here and now?

230
00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:17.755
Joseph, don't be afraid.

231
00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:42.449
Joe.

232
00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:44.451
Joseph!

233
00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:46.484
You're not gonna die.

234
00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.445
I swear to God you're
not gonna die.

235
00:21:41.342 --> 00:21:42.832
<i>Dear Joseph,</i>

236
00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:49.422
<i>your mother thinks it's best
that I stay away for a while.</i>

237
00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.594
<i>And I agree.</i>

238
00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:04.688
<i>You see,
I have a secret,</i>

239
00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:07.820
<i>one I've never shared
with you before.</i>

240
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.118
<i>I'm a knight, like the ones
in our favorite book,</i>

241
00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:13.788
<i>roaming a dangerous world.</i>

242
00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:16.787
<i>Righting wrongs,
slaying dragons.</i>

243
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.090
<i>And I don't want those dragons
to hurt you, or your mom...</i>

244
00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:25.758
<i>ever again.</i>

245
00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:15.099
That was a mistake.

246
00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:10.025
Who sent you?

247
00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:12.158
Does it matter?

248
00:24:13.744 --> 00:24:17.157
I was paid a small fortune
to liberate what's hidden away downstairs.

249
00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:20.118
But frankly, Bora...

250
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:28.873
Would have done
this one for free.

251
00:25:01.208 --> 00:25:02.369
It's all right.

252
00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:05.577
No one's gonna hurt
you ever again.

253
00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:11.479
<i>Hello, Wilson.</i>

254
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.732
<i>Or do you prefer 'Deathstroke.</i>

255
00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:15.108
Who the hell...

256
00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:19.860
<i>You can call me
the H.I. V. E. Queen.</i>

257
00:26:19.953 --> 00:26:21.569
H.I.V.E. is gone.

258
00:26:21.663 --> 00:26:23.495
I spent years making sure of that.

259
00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:26.324
<i>No, not gone,
underground.</i>

260
00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:28.834
<i>Regrouping.</i>

261
00:26:28.921 --> 00:26:32.789
<i>Dozens of independent cells
scattered across the world.</i>

262
00:26:32.883 --> 00:26:37.377
<i>And my little cell is very interested
in the Wilson family.</i>

263
00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:39.963
I turned H.I.V.E.
down ten years ago.

264
00:26:40.057 --> 00:26:41.923
<i>- And if you think...
- Don't flatter yourself.</i>

265
00:26:42.017 --> 00:26:44.554
<i>You made it clear then
that you were a bad fit.</i>

266
00:26:44.645 --> 00:26:47.979
<i>And really,
why bother with the father</i>

267
00:26:48.065 --> 00:26:49.772
<i>when I have the son?</i>

268
00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:51.189
What?

269
00:26:52.361 --> 00:26:54.068
Joseph?

270
00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:55.861
<i>You're a handgun, Slade.</i>

271
00:26:57.241 --> 00:27:00.905
<i>Your boy,
he's a nuclear bomb.</i>

272
00:27:00.994 --> 00:27:03.452
<i>A bomb that belongs to me now.</i>

273
00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:04.870
What have you done to him?

274
00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:11.081
<i>Me?
Don't you know?</i>

275
00:27:11.672 --> 00:27:13.128
<i>You did this.</i>

276
00:27:15.592 --> 00:27:17.128
<i>You didn't know.</i>

277
00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:19.877
<i>More's the pity.</i>

278
00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:54.499
I chose that school in Switzerland
for the security.

279
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.830
You chose poorly.

280
00:27:57.593 --> 00:27:58.593
Did you know?

281
00:27:58.635 --> 00:28:01.923
That whatever the Army did to alter
your biology, your genetics,

282
00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:04.301
<i>was passed on</i> to <i>Joseph?
Of course not.</i>

283
00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:08.180
From what that H.I.V.E. Queen said,
his abilities are very different than mine.

284
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.557
Not physical in nature, psychic.

285
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.771
What?

286
00:28:13.192 --> 00:28:14.603
There were times when I'd...

287
00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:17.146
feel him.

288
00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:21.568
As if he was in the room with me.
But I thought I was just imagining it.

289
00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:24.821
He should have been with you.
How could you just send him away like that?

290
00:28:24.912 --> 00:28:27.028
I did it to keep him safe.

291
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:30.042
- I could have kept him safe.
- The way you did last time?

292
00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:33.075
When that animal cut his throat
and left him mute?

293
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.457
You punished me enough
for it, didn't you'?

294
00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:37.333
Locked me out of his life.

295
00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:43.336
And you never once questioned it.
Never once tried to see him.

296
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.797
Another man would have
fought me tooth and nail,

297
00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:47.882
would have begged to
see his son.

298
00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:52.721
But you? One pathetic letter,
and then you were gone forever.

299
00:28:52.814 --> 00:28:53.895
Why?

300
00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:56.519
I always seem to be
asking you that. Why?

301
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.396
The past is dead, Addie,

302
00:28:58.487 --> 00:29:01.070
and nothing we do, nothing we say,
can change it.

303
00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:03.238
But the past isn't dead, Slade.

304
00:29:03.325 --> 00:29:06.067
It's happening all over again.

305
00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:08.698
- So what are we going to do about it?
- "We"?

306
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:11.121
You're not going after him
alone this time.

307
00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:12.744
I'm going with you.

308
00:29:13.293 --> 00:29:15.034
Do you remember
what the Jackal did to you?

309
00:29:15.128 --> 00:29:16.334
Oh, I remember.

310
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:19.209
He broke me.
Humiliated me.

311
00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:20.630
And it was my own fault.

312
00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:23.550
I put so much energy into
being a mother,

313
00:29:23.637 --> 00:29:25.002
being your wife,

314
00:29:25.097 --> 00:29:26.804
that I lost my center.

315
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.221
Well, I've found it again.

316
00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:32.013
You haven't been
on a combat mission in years.

317
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.476
Guess I'm just too rusty, huh?

318
00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:46.065
Stay out of it, Adeline.

319
00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.866
Slade. Slade.

320
00:29:53.417 --> 00:29:54.498
Good luck.

321
00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:19.579
It's a beautiful home, Colonel Kapoor,

322
00:31:26.468 --> 00:31:29.506
Built with H.I.V.E. money,
as I recall.

323
00:31:29.596 --> 00:31:34.136
I stopped working for them years ago,
as you no doubt also recall.

324
00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:36.850
You had no choice.

325
00:31:36.937 --> 00:31:38.018
I destroyed them.

326
00:31:38.772 --> 00:31:40.262
Or so I thought.

327
00:31:40.357 --> 00:31:41.392
They're back?

328
00:31:41.483 --> 00:31:44.566
<i>And I want information
about one cell in particular,</i>

329
00:31:44.653 --> 00:31:47.270
<i>led by a woman who calls herself
the H.I. \/.E. Queen.</i>

330
00:31:47.364 --> 00:31:50.106
<i>I closed the door
on that chapter of my life.</i>

331
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.817
<i>I've spoken to close
to a dozen former operatives</i>

332
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:54.822
<i>who all claim the same thing.</i>

333
00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:55.948
And?

334
00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:57.871
Telling the truth,
<i>as</i> far <i>as</i> I know.

335
00:31:57.958 --> 00:31:59.244
And?

336
00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:01.575
Don't worry, colonel,
I left them all intact.

337
00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:02.785
Aside from Myshkin.

338
00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:05.997
He was so afraid to even talk
about H.I.V.E. that he killed himself.

339
00:32:06.091 --> 00:32:09.584
I was never in very deep,
Deathstroke, you know that.

340
00:32:09.678 --> 00:32:12.887
As a colonel I... I could provide
a favor here and there.

341
00:32:12.973 --> 00:32:15.089
For which you were
richly rewarded.

342
00:32:15.183 --> 00:32:18.551
And the truth is, I was relieved
when you took them down.

343
00:32:19.646 --> 00:32:21.853
I have a wife now.
A family.

344
00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:25.683
A little graft is one thing,
but getting involved with H.I.V.E. again...

345
00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:26.777
No.

346
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:32.986
If you hear anything,

347
00:32:33.577 --> 00:32:35.864
you contact me immediately.

348
00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:36.954
I will.

349
00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.353
<i>This better be good, Kapoor.</i>

350
00:33:46.566 --> 00:33:47.852
Impressive.

351
00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:50.229
This is a surprise.

352
00:33:58.411 --> 00:33:59.697
Look at you.

353
00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:02.325
Hero of the Kaznian revolution.

354
00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:04.824
You know how it goes.

355
00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:07.205
Southern Kaznians take the capital.

356
00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:09.411
A few years go by,
and then the north takes it.

357
00:34:09.506 --> 00:34:11.497
Been going on for years.

358
00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:14.299
I've worked for both sides.
They're very generous.

359
00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:17.219
And children starve.
Innocents die.

360
00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:20.138
Still singing the same song,
huh, Wilson?

361
00:34:20.225 --> 00:34:22.307
The mercenary with a conscience.

362
00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:23.600
The rest of us...

363
00:34:24.187 --> 00:34:25.473
we're beneath you!

364
00:34:31.111 --> 00:34:33.569
I didn't come hereto debate, Tiger.

365
00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:36.234
Or to fight.

366
00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:38.736
I came here for information.

367
00:34:38.827 --> 00:34:40.738
If it's dope on H.I.V.E. you want...

368
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:57.134
You have nothing to do with them.
Didn't even know they still existed.

369
00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:07.097
Oh, I knew.

370
00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:09.054
Once the Jackal took over.

371
00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:12.850
Jackal? He's alive?

372
00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:18.902
You should've made sure
he was dead.

373
00:35:20.994 --> 00:35:24.362
That man has a serious
hate on for you.

374
00:35:27.626 --> 00:35:29.993
After that mess with your kid,

375
00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:33.078
Jackal decided that H.I.V.E.
needed reorganization.

376
00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:36.165
New leadership.
So he stepped back.

377
00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:39.297
And let me wipe out
his competition.

378
00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:48.226
And then, very quietly,
put the pieces back together.

379
00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:11.575
But I was tired of taking orders.

380
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.910
Decided to freelance.

381
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:16.747
Worked out pretty well.

382
00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:32.433
Again?

383
00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:34.014
Son of a bitch.

384
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:36.066
You did it again.

385
00:36:36.152 --> 00:36:38.314
Where can I find the H.I.V.E Queen?

386
00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:54.208
Fine.

387
00:36:54.587 --> 00:36:55.827
The Kerguelen Islands.

388
00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.254
Thank you.

389
00:37:00.093 --> 00:37:01.254
That's my ride.

390
00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:17.937
Don't bother.
Where he's headed, there's no coming back.

391
00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:22.442
Oh, shit.

392
00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:38.499
So, how the hell did you get your hands
on an aircraft like this?

393
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.876
Somebody owed me a favor.

394
00:37:39.966 --> 00:37:42.128
A very big one, apparently.

395
00:37:43.344 --> 00:37:45.104
There's every chance
they know you're coming.

396
00:37:45.138 --> 00:37:48.130
- I'm counting on it.
- You'll never change.

397
00:37:48.224 --> 00:37:50.056
Having second thoughts, Wintergreen?

398
00:37:50.143 --> 00:37:51.304
On the contrary.

399
00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:53.510
Since MIG retired me,

400
00:37:53.605 --> 00:37:58.065
the only fun I ever have is when
you invite me along on these little jaunts.

401
00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:02.645
I'll be too old for this soon enough.
Well, I'm probably too old for it now,

402
00:38:02.739 --> 00:38:04.776
but I'm not ready for the nursing home
just yet.

403
00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:06.527
This one's no jaunt.

404
00:38:06.618 --> 00:38:08.200
Joseph's life is at stake.

405
00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:09.947
And what kind of godfather
would I be

406
00:38:10.038 --> 00:38:12.120
if I wasn't helping you
bring him home?

407
00:38:12.207 --> 00:38:13.413
In fact, I...

408
00:38:14.209 --> 00:38:15.916
There they are.

409
00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:20.546
The Kerguelens. Also known
as the Desolation Islands.

410
00:38:21.424 --> 00:38:22.789
Aptly named, I think.

411
00:38:30.934 --> 00:38:34.643
- Best of <i>luck,</i> Slade.
- I don't believe in luck.

412
00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:36.891
But in this case, I'll take it.

413
00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:58.055
I was expecting an army.

414
00:39:59.314 --> 00:40:00.804
They don't need an army.

415
00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.815
They've got me.

416
00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:07.896
Sandra Wu San.
Also known as Lady Shiva.

417
00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:09.650
There are people
who consider you

418
00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:12.073
the deadliest hand-to-hand combatant
in the world.

419
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.071
And they would be right.

420
00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:22.792
- What are you doing?
- Surrendering.

421
00:40:22.879 --> 00:40:25.211
I do not accept your surrender.

422
00:40:25.298 --> 00:40:26.834
<i>Not tonight, Shiva.</i>

423
00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:29.542
<i>I want him alive.
Bring him to me.</i>

424
00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:32.419
Yes, my queen.

425
00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.097
Up.

426
00:40:52.367 --> 00:40:54.699
Surrender is a clever strategy.

427
00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:57.904
Easier than fighting your way
into the fortress.

428
00:40:57.997 --> 00:41:00.489
But it won't be quite
as easy getting out.

429
00:41:03.378 --> 00:41:06.086
- What?
- You're just a child.

430
00:41:14.806 --> 00:41:17.764
And you're a dinosaur
whose time has passed.

431
00:41:22.605 --> 00:41:24.516
Let's cut the bullshit,
shall we?

432
00:41:24.607 --> 00:41:27.099
Where's my boy?
Where's Joseph.

433
00:41:28.027 --> 00:41:30.519
Yes. Let's cut the bullshit.

434
00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:36.323
Where is he?

435
00:41:36.411 --> 00:41:37.993
Such concern.

436
00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:41.572
And yet, you abandoned Joseph
without a second thought

437
00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:43.122
just <i>as</i> his mother did.

438
00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:47.498
Left him trapped, isolated,
friendless in that school.

439
00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:50.922
His mind,
his very soul, on fire.

440
00:41:51.009 --> 00:41:53.592
- I didn't know.
- Could it be...

441
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:56.962
you didn't want to?

442
00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:01.930
So, he's what,
your little lab rat?

443
00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.136
We're going to train him.

444
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:06.688
Help him master his powers.

445
00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:08.936
You've got him
locked in a damn cage.

446
00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:10.688
For his own protection.

447
00:42:10.778 --> 00:42:13.941
His psychic energies are
still wildly unstable.

448
00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:15.739
But his potential,

449
00:42:16.325 --> 00:42:17.531
limitless.

450
00:42:17.618 --> 00:42:20.155
- As a weapon.
- Yes.

451
00:42:20.788 --> 00:42:22.119
Think of it.

452
00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:26.040
Manipulation on a global scale
through the power of the mind.

453
00:42:26.127 --> 00:42:28.619
Domination of the planet
with no bullets.

454
00:42:28.713 --> 00:42:30.044
No bombs.

455
00:42:30.131 --> 00:42:33.715
What country on
Earth could resist us?

456
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.045
Joseph? Joseph!

457
00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:42.427
Joseph! Don't be afraid.

458
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:48.017
Joe...

459
00:42:50.026 --> 00:42:52.859
"Joseph" was the name
you gave him.

460
00:42:53.863 --> 00:42:55.570
But I've given him a new name.

461
00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:56.862
A better name.

462
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.861
Jericho.

463
00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:00.441
Because, with my help,

464
00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:04.700
he's going to bring the walls
of the old order tumbling down.

465
00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:11.248
Be honest, Wilson.

466
00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:14.548
You don't really care about him.
You never did.

467
00:43:15.134 --> 00:43:17.216
This is just another
adventure to you.

468
00:43:17.303 --> 00:43:20.261
Another chance to prove
your questionable manhood.

469
00:43:20.848 --> 00:43:22.054
But here,

470
00:43:22.809 --> 00:43:26.097
he'll find a home,
a family.

471
00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:31.222
<i>Help me, Papa.</i>

472
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:32.933
<i>Get me out of here!</i>

473
00:43:33.027 --> 00:43:34.358
<i>Please!</i>

474
00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:36.440
Get back, buddy.

475
00:43:40.368 --> 00:43:41.574
No!

476
00:44:39.594 --> 00:44:41.426
<i>I can help.
Put me down.</i>

477
00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:43.469
<i>- You're weak.
- I'm all right.</i>

478
00:44:49.937 --> 00:44:50.972
Joe.

479
00:44:52.607 --> 00:44:53.893
<i>I know a way out.</i>

480
00:44:56.694 --> 00:44:58.355
<i>This will get us to the surface.</i>

481
00:44:58.446 --> 00:45:00.437
<i>But I don't know what to do
once we're up there.</i>

482
00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:03.239
I've got that covered.
Wintergreen, it's time.

483
00:45:03.326 --> 00:45:04.987
On my way, Slade.

484
00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:15.331
<i>That's all...</i>

485
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:17.003
<i>That's all I can.</i>

486
00:45:18.883 --> 00:45:22.842
Wintergreen. Wintergreen?

487
00:45:22.929 --> 00:45:24.795
<i>Uncle William's not coming.</i>

488
00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:27.631
<i>- What?
- I blocked the signal.</i>

489
00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:29.090
But I heard him.

490
00:45:29.185 --> 00:45:31.392
<i>You heard what
I wanted you to hear.</i>

491
00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:33.720
Joseph, Why?

492
00:45:33.814 --> 00:45:36.852
<i>Did you really think
I would betray my own sister?</i>

493
00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:38.568
Sister?

494
00:45:46.953 --> 00:45:49.240
The H.I.V.E. Queen, she's.

495
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:50.946
<i>Your daughter.</i>

496
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:54.532
<i>You really didn't know?</i>

497
00:45:54.627 --> 00:45:57.039
Joseph, listen to me.
I came here...

498
00:45:57.129 --> 00:46:00.247
<i>Ride to the rescue
like a knight in shining armor?</i>

499
00:46:02.218 --> 00:46:03.754
Joseph. Joseph!

500
00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:05.714
<i>My name</i>

501
00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:07.675
<i>is Jericho!</i>

502
00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:13.055
<i>Joseph's gone.</i>

503
00:46:13.145 --> 00:46:14.306
Joseph!

504
00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:22.940
<i>Good-bye, Deathstroke.</i>

505
00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:49.338
Joseph.

506
00:47:00.443 --> 00:47:02.901
Well done, boy.
Well done.

507
00:47:18.377 --> 00:47:19.458
<i>Dark.</i>

508
00:47:21.172 --> 00:47:22.287
<i>Stillness.</i>

509
00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:24.797
<i>Peace.</i>

510
00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:26.676
<i>Oblivion.</i>

511
00:47:29.388 --> 00:47:33.006
<i>Is it such a terrible thing
to embrace the void,</i>

512
00:47:34.477 --> 00:47:36.434
<i>surrender to the silence,</i>

513
00:47:37.438 --> 00:47:38.438
<i>die?</i>

514
00:47:41.067 --> 00:47:43.183
<i>But I can't die now.</i>

515
00:47:43.277 --> 00:47:45.268
<i>One day,
maybe soon.</i>

516
00:47:46.197 --> 00:47:47.983
<i>But not yet.</i>

517
00:47:49.992 --> 00:47:52.233
<i>Joseph needs me.</i>

518
00:47:52.328 --> 00:47:53.443
<i>My son needs me.</i>

519
00:47:54.872 --> 00:47:55.953
<i>And I...</i>

520
00:47:57.083 --> 00:47:58.083
<i>have...</i>

521
00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:00.287
<i>to live!</i>

522
00:48:06.801 --> 00:48:08.542
Easy. Easy.

523
00:48:08.636 --> 00:48:11.298
How am I even alive?

524
00:48:12.098 --> 00:48:13.509
You almost weren't.

525
00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:16.091
If I hadn't
fished you out in time...

526
00:48:16.185 --> 00:48:17.550
Addie?

527
00:48:17.645 --> 00:48:21.559
You may have an incredible ability
to heal, Slade.

528
00:48:21.649 --> 00:48:23.185
But you're not immortal.

529
00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:30.905
And one of these days,
you won't be coming back.

530
00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:37.032
Told you I wasn't gonna let you
do this alone.

531
00:48:38.082 --> 00:48:40.494
- Where are we?
- On a boat.

532
00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:42.951
Far enough away from
that damn island.

533
00:48:43.045 --> 00:48:44.831
How did...

534
00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:46.037
How did you find me?

535
00:48:46.132 --> 00:48:48.840
I've been on you the whole time.

536
00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:51.668
Used a nano-tracker that I procured
from an old friend.

537
00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:54.800
Tiny GPS device that lodged
into your intestinal tract.

538
00:48:56.225 --> 00:48:58.683
- But how did...
- Sealed with a kiss.

539
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.267
You implanted it
with your tongue?

540
00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:11.900
And here I thought
I'd won your heart again.

541
00:49:11.991 --> 00:49:13.777
It's got a limited shelf life.

542
00:49:13.868 --> 00:49:15.700
Should dissolve in
another few days.

543
00:49:16.412 --> 00:49:17.994
Drink this.

544
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.243
A mix of herbs that should help
speed up your natural healing.

545
00:49:22.251 --> 00:49:23.992
Drink it, tough guy.

546
00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:30.967
Ah...

547
00:49:31.469 --> 00:49:32.755
Wait.

548
00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:35.212
You said you got your tracker
from an old friend.

549
00:49:36.223 --> 00:49:39.557
Wintergreen. You two have
been conspiring?

550
00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:44.308
Not conspiring, just sharing information
and resources.

551
00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:46.230
When I see that old man...

552
00:49:46.317 --> 00:49:49.230
If you're going to be angry
at someone, try yourself.

553
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.108
You've made some terrible
choices in your life, Slade.

554
00:49:52.198 --> 00:49:56.157
And the people you love,
that you claim to love,

555
00:49:56.243 --> 00:49:58.405
have paid a terrible price.

556
00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:05.157
So he's dead?

557
00:50:05.252 --> 00:50:08.040
The sharks have made
a meal of him by now.

558
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:11.339
You must feel a profound sense
of satisfaction, Rose.

559
00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:13.837
I wish I did.

560
00:50:13.928 --> 00:50:17.011
I've wanted this for so long,
but now that I have it...

561
00:50:17.097 --> 00:50:20.385
Let it go, child.
You've done well.

562
00:50:20.476 --> 00:50:21.762
Made me proud.

563
00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:23.718
Now let's move on
with our plans.

564
00:50:24.396 --> 00:50:26.228
We need more time.

565
00:50:26.315 --> 00:50:27.805
Jericho is not ready.

566
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.688
You'll make sure he's ready,
won't you?

567
00:50:30.778 --> 00:50:32.360
- But...
- Won't you?

568
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.566
Yes.

569
00:50:34.657 --> 00:50:36.068
I have faith in you, Rose.

570
00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:38.365
I've always had faith in you.

571
00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:39.817
Since the day we met

572
00:50:39.912 --> 00:50:43.951
and I rescued you from
a hellish existence.

573
00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:45.782
It wasn't all hell.

574
00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:49.042
<i>My mother,</i>

575
00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:50.369
<i>she loved me.</i>

576
00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:52.922
Yes, she did.

577
00:50:53.008 --> 00:50:54.840
<i>After Wilson abandoned her.</i>

578
00:50:54.927 --> 00:50:56.713
<i>Left her pregnant and alone.</i>

579
00:50:56.804 --> 00:50:59.546
<i>She sacrificed everything
to build a good life for you.</i>

580
00:51:05.813 --> 00:51:07.679
<i>And perhaps,
it would have been good...</i>

581
00:51:11.235 --> 00:51:12.475
<i>...had she lived.</i>

582
00:51:15.948 --> 00:51:17.689
<i>And you were left alone.</i>

583
00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:20.445
<i>And Wilson,</i>

584
00:51:20.536 --> 00:51:23.073
<i>did he ever look
back and wonder?</i>

585
00:51:23.163 --> 00:51:27.122
<i>If he'd bothered, he might have discovered
that he had a daughter</i>

586
00:51:27.209 --> 00:51:29.166
<i>living on the streets
of Phnom Penh.</i>

587
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.338
<i>But your father did leave
you one legacy.</i>

588
00:51:34.425 --> 00:51:37.417
<i>He passed his altered genetics
onto you.</i>

589
00:51:39.597 --> 00:51:42.385
<i>Speed, stamina,</i>

590
00:51:43.183 --> 00:51:44.183
<i>heightened strength...</i>

591
00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:47.643
<i>What a gift.</i>

592
00:51:48.522 --> 00:51:50.012
<i>It was a curse.</i>

593
00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:57.691
<i>I suppose it was at first.</i>

594
00:51:59.908 --> 00:52:00.989
<i>But then...</i>

595
00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:05.111
<i>I found you.</i>

596
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:09.248
Took you under my wing,
trained you,

597
00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:11.121
became the father you never had.

598
00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:13.077
Made you a queen.

599
00:52:13.172 --> 00:52:16.210
And now, you'll make your
brother a king.

600
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.008
- And together...
- We'll rule the world?

601
00:52:19.094 --> 00:52:22.177
No. We'll rule the rulers.

602
00:52:22.264 --> 00:52:24.471
So much better that way.

603
00:52:24.558 --> 00:52:27.300
Project Jericho launches in
ten days, Rose.

604
00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:30.512
I have my final preparations
to see to and you have yours.

605
00:52:31.106 --> 00:52:32.106
Be ready.

606
00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:34.724
Will I see you then?

607
00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:36.684
It's been more than a year.

608
00:52:36.779 --> 00:52:39.146
You know I have to remain
in seclusion.

609
00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:42.152
No one can know where the H.I.V.E. Lord is.
Not even you.

610
00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:44.404
But this, child,

611
00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:46.202
I wouldn't miss for the world.

612
00:52:52.628 --> 00:52:53.789
<i>You okay?</i>

613
00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:58.255
I am now.

614
00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:06.176
I didn't know Lillian
was pregnant.

615
00:53:06.266 --> 00:53:07.677
She never told me.

616
00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:10.248
- If I had known...
- You would've been the father to that girl

617
00:53:10.312 --> 00:53:12.178
that you were to Joseph?

618
00:53:13.107 --> 00:53:15.690
Years ago, when you told
me about Lillian,

619
00:53:15.776 --> 00:53:17.892
you said she didn't
mean anything to you.

620
00:53:19.446 --> 00:53:20.446
Was that true?

621
00:53:20.989 --> 00:53:23.856
She didn't.
Not like you, Addie.

622
00:53:23.951 --> 00:53:27.535
- But?
- After I realized what had happened to me...

623
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:30.617
what the army
had turned me into, I felt...

624
00:53:30.708 --> 00:53:33.496
lost. Untethered.

625
00:53:33.585 --> 00:53:35.917
I needed time to
sort through things.

626
00:53:36.004 --> 00:53:38.336
So, I traveled.
Looking for...

627
00:53:38.424 --> 00:53:40.335
Something I couldn't give you?

628
00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:43.760
I don't know.
Maybe it was easier turning to a stranger.

629
00:53:43.846 --> 00:53:45.928
Lillian was a good woman.

630
00:53:46.014 --> 00:53:47.675
Sweet. Kind.

631
00:53:47.766 --> 00:53:50.849
- So you did care about her.
- Yes. But not like...

632
00:53:50.936 --> 00:53:53.394
And just left her,
pregnant and alone.

633
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.642
I didn't know about the child.

634
00:53:55.733 --> 00:53:57.573
Would you rather I'd stayed
with her and not...

635
00:53:57.609 --> 00:53:59.441
I'd rather it had
never happened.

636
00:53:59.528 --> 00:54:01.189
It sounds funny,
I know.

637
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.862
But my affair with Lillian,

638
00:54:02.948 --> 00:54:05.736
it's what made me realize
that you were the only one.

639
00:54:05.826 --> 00:54:08.534
- That no other woman could...
- I'm not laughing.

640
00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.533
- I didn't mean it like that.
- What did you mean?

641
00:54:11.623 --> 00:54:13.205
Addie, I.

642
00:54:19.673 --> 00:54:22.210
Doesn't matter now,
does it?

643
00:54:22.843 --> 00:54:25.710
No. Not when you destroyed
our family,

644
00:54:25.804 --> 00:54:27.966
and another one
you didn't even know you had.

645
00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:30.639
That's your forte, isn't it?
Destruction.

646
00:54:30.726 --> 00:54:33.093
If you feel that way, then why the hell
are you helping me?

647
00:54:33.187 --> 00:54:34.769
I'm not helping you.

648
00:54:34.855 --> 00:54:36.220
I'm helping Joseph.

649
00:54:36.315 --> 00:54:37.771
And once this is done,

650
00:54:38.358 --> 00:54:39.439
so are we.

651
00:54:45.824 --> 00:54:48.236
<i>We did the right thing,
didn't we?</i>

652
00:54:49.077 --> 00:54:50.077
Yes.

653
00:54:50.162 --> 00:54:51.948
Of course, we did.

654
00:54:52.039 --> 00:54:53.950
He was a monster.

655
00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:56.032
He had to die.

656
00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.662
<i>He was a knight once.</i>

657
00:54:57.753 --> 00:54:59.039
What?

658
00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:00.164
<i>N... Nothing.</i>

659
00:55:02.007 --> 00:55:04.499
I know a part of you
still loves them.

660
00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:07.176
You can't help it.

661
00:55:07.262 --> 00:55:11.256
But Slade Wilson
never gave a damn about you.

662
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:13.182
His entire life was a lie.

663
00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:15.434
And your mother,

664
00:55:15.521 --> 00:55:17.432
if she really loved you,

665
00:55:17.523 --> 00:55:20.106
would she have locked you away
in that school,

666
00:55:20.192 --> 00:55:21.978
left you there to rot?

667
00:55:23.529 --> 00:55:25.111
Would she?

668
00:55:25.197 --> 00:55:26.197
<i>No.</i>

669
00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:43.541
We were both so alone, Jericho.

670
00:55:43.632 --> 00:55:45.464
So alone.

671
00:55:45.551 --> 00:55:48.794
But we found each other,
didn't we?

672
00:55:51.223 --> 00:55:54.261
I guess we can thank
Deathstroke for that much.

673
00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:56.467
Years before we ever met,

674
00:55:56.562 --> 00:55:58.599
your mind reached out,

675
00:55:58.689 --> 00:55:59.724
found me.

676
00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:01.556
We knew each other,

677
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:05.769
shared each other's thoughts,
feelings, all our hopes,

678
00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:08.021
all our sorrows.

679
00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:09.981
When this...

680
00:56:10.075 --> 00:56:13.113
this power inside me came alive,

681
00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:15.410
I was so scared, Rose.

682
00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:17.829
I thought it was going
to burn me up,

683
00:56:17.916 --> 00:56:19.532
tear me apart.

684
00:56:19.626 --> 00:56:21.993
But then,
I felt something.

685
00:56:22.087 --> 00:56:23.248
Like...

686
00:56:23.338 --> 00:56:25.750
Like the echo of my own soul.

687
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:27.172
Me.

688
00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:29.750
You.

689
00:56:29.845 --> 00:56:31.586
I think I would have
died without you.

690
00:56:33.557 --> 00:56:35.639
And I would have
died without you.

691
00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:40.390
You see, Jericho,

692
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.812
you don't need a mother
or a father...

693
00:56:45.986 --> 00:56:47.397
when you have me.

694
00:56:51.825 --> 00:56:54.783
<i>And what about the man
who calls himself your father?</i>

695
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:56.156
<i>What about the Jackal?</i>

696
00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:05.294
Wintergreen, you there?

697
00:57:06.882 --> 00:57:08.247
<i>Always.</i>

698
00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:25.310
Hey, what about the boat?

699
00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:30.811
I stole it, anyway.

700
00:57:44.878 --> 00:57:45.959
Bring them in.

701
00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:55.548
Thank you, agents,
for volunteering.

702
00:57:55.639 --> 00:57:57.505
But we didn't volun...

703
00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:02.259
Agent Sanchez,
step forward.

704
00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:08.857
<i>On your knees.</i>

705
00:58:11.363 --> 00:58:12.899
Now her.

706
00:58:15.283 --> 00:58:16.899
<i>Your weapon.</i>

707
00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.665
This is nothing compared to
what's coming.

708
00:58:25.752 --> 00:58:29.586
And if you can't do this,
all our plans are for nothing.

709
00:58:29.673 --> 00:58:31.084
<i>All right.</i>

710
00:58:34.219 --> 00:58:35.334
<i>Shoot him.</i>

711
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:50.182
<i>I can't.</i>

712
00:58:54.322 --> 00:58:56.029
Why'd you stop?

713
00:58:56.116 --> 00:58:57.527
<i>It worked,
didn't it?</i>

714
00:58:57.617 --> 00:58:59.483
<i>She would've killed him
on my command.</i>

715
00:58:59.578 --> 00:59:01.410
<i>Why lose a perfectly good agent?</i>

716
00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:03.578
Fine.

717
00:59:03.665 --> 00:59:06.578
Then let's have a show,
shall we?

718
00:59:30.067 --> 00:59:31.523
That's enough, Jericho.

719
00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:41.859
That's enough.

720
00:59:48.293 --> 00:59:49.293
Jericho, stop!

721
00:59:50.003 --> 00:59:51.038
Stop!

722
01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.513
<i>Oh, God!
Oh, God!</i>

723
01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.766
<i>I'm sorry, Rose.
I don't know what happened!</i>

724
01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:11.722
<i>I couldn't control it! I...</i>

725
01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:14.104
Shh. It's my fault.

726
01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:17.107
I pushed you too far.
Too fast.

727
01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.858
We'll go a little
slower tonight.

728
01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:22.237
<i>Tonight?
But, can't we...</i>

729
01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.863
Tomorrow, then.

730
01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.704
And no more excuses.

731
01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.083
How did you get this?

732
01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:37.631
While you were blundering
into the H.l.V.E. Queen's trap,

733
01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:40.459
I was hacking into their sewers.

734
01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:44.012
Jericho.
That's what she called Joseph.

735
01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.997
They're turning our son
into a weapon of war.

736
01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:17.079
Remember what she said?
I'm a handgun, but Joseph's...

737
01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.539
A nuclear bomb.

738
01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:20.294
But not in the way you think.

739
01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:24.470
Those exercises are to help him master
his abilities, focus them.

740
01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:25.556
But the goal?

741
01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.924
A revolution from within.

742
01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:33.013
Imagine if you controlled someone
who could control the minds of others.

743
01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:37.350
Presidents, prime ministers,
despots, kings.

744
01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:39.685
Mind-theft on a global scale.

745
01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:42.897
You could reshape the planet
without firing a single shot.

746
01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:46.985
And we've got ten days to figure out
what their first move is.

747
01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:49.786
And it's all because of her.

748
01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:52.410
She used Joseph.
Manipulated him.

749
01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:57.540
<i>You can do this.</i>

750
01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:01.210
<i>I know you're scared, Jericho,</i>

751
01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:03.087
<i>but I believe in you.</i>

752
01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:05.636
<i>As long as we have each other,
little brother,</i>

753
01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.589
<i>there's nothing
we can't accomplish.</i>

754
01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:10.924
<i>We're two parts of a whole.</i>

755
01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.805
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

756
01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:15.354
<i>Never abandon you
the way they did.</i>

757
01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:18.565
<i>We 're family.</i>

758
01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:26.483
Is that manipulation or love?

759
01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:34.205
Thanks, Addie.
I'll take it from here.

760
01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.158
The hell you will!

761
01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.870
You don't get to decide
what I do or don't do.

762
01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:41.456
You've risked enough.
This is my job.

763
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:44.507
I lived with risk every damn day
we were married,

764
01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:48.178
only, I never knew it,
did I, Deathstroke?

765
01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:49.676
You never told me.

766
01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.882
Please, can we stop
dredging up the past?

767
01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:54.514
You know there's something else
you never told me.

768
01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:55.639
Why?

769
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:58.813
Why did you choose
Deathstroke over us?

770
01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.813
A life of deceit and risk,
instead of...

771
01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:04.190
I didn't choose to be one
over the other, Addie.

772
01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:07.399
- And I didn't choose to be this.
- There's always a choice.

773
01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:09.859
Those bastards made me this way

774
01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:11.694
with their damned experiment.

775
01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:15.747
- And I did the best I could with it.
- That was your best?

776
01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:18.622
A mercenary?
A murderer.

777
01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:20.623
My father was a soldier.

778
01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.045
His father was a soldier.

779
01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:24.749
All I knew was the military life.

780
01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:28.711
- So I took that training and...
- Corrupted it. Spit on it.

781
01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.671
This world is filled with evil.

782
01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:33.097
On a scale you can't comprehend.

783
01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:36.719
Oh, I have some idea.

784
01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:41.023
Then you should understand that I just did
what we did when we sewed together.

785
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:42.725
Took down the bad guys.

786
01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.106
Don't you dare compare the two.

787
01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:55.663
I... I tried to be the knight
Joseph believed I was.

788
01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:57.615
A knight?

789
01:03:57.709 --> 01:03:59.791
Is that what you think you are?

790
01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:03.542
Oh, my God, Slade,
are you that delusional?

791
01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:05.872
Joseph didn't need a knight.

792
01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:07.332
He needed a father.

793
01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:09.509
I needed a husband.

794
01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:14.466
What's so wrong inside you that
you preferred Deathstroke to us?

795
01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.975
My life as Deathstroke,

796
01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:18.928
it was separate from my life with you.

797
01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.935
- It had nothing to do with...
- You really don't see it?

798
01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:24.483
All these years
you've been compartmentalizing.

799
01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:27.652
Filing pieces of yourself
away in little boxes.

800
01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:30.447
Lying to yourself.
And to me.

801
01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:33.863
Thank you.

802
01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:35.614
For what?

803
01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:40.120
For reminding me why I've chosen
to remain a bachelor all these years.

804
01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:45.746
Now, are you two going to spend
the day at each other's throats,

805
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.253
or are we going to save Joseph,
and perhaps the world?

806
01:05:15.453 --> 01:05:17.410
<i>The nation has been rocked
this morning</i>

807
01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:20.956
<i>by what appear to be a series
of coordinated terrorist attacks.</i>

808
01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:23.830
<i>Moments after a hijacked
Patriot Airlines flight</i>

809
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.003
<i>was deliberately crashed
into the Golden Gate Bridge,</i>

810
01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:31.675
a <i>dozen armed men launched a mass attack
in New York Times Square.</i>

811
01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:35.129
<i>While in Washington,
at least one bomb, possibly more,</i>

812
01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:37.339
<i>tore through
the Capitol Building.</i>

813
01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:40.142
<i>No estimates yet
on total casualties,</i>

814
01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:44.643
<i>but it's clear that hundreds of lives
have been lost, perhaps more.</i>

815
01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:48.316
<i>The president, just returning
from the World Economic Forum in Davos,</i>

816
01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:50.064
<i>remains aboard Air Force One,</i>

817
01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:53.147
<i>while all other flights across the nation
have been grounded.</i>

818
01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:58.778
God damn it. I look like a weak fool,
circling around up here,

819
01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:00.078
afraid to land.

820
01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:04.033
It has nothing to do with fear, sir.
It's for your safety.

821
01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.243
Until we know the full extent
of the attacks...

822
01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:08.374
The nation needs to be reassured!

823
01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:12.129
And the commander-in-chief
needs to be protected.

824
01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:18.430
Eerie, isn't it?

825
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.177
We're the only plane in the sky.

826
01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:27.105
At least,
we're supposed to be.

827
01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:40.072
Our attacks were
the perfect distraction.

828
01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:42.700
The entire country is in chaos.

829
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:46.533
People are hiding away in their little
holes like the frightened rabbits they are.

830
01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.962
And there he sits, all alone.

831
01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:55.459
A fat, ripe fruit,
ready for the picking.

832
01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:59.467
Without you, child,
none of this would be possible.

833
01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:02.515
If I've pleased you,
sir, then...

834
01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.889
You've more than pleased me.

835
01:07:04.979 --> 01:07:06.890
You've given me the world.

836
01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:08.767
Are you ready, son?

837
01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.440
<i>I... I think so.</i>

838
01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:11.813
You think?

839
01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:13.814
<i>I am, sir.</i>

840
01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:15.441
We'll swarm them.

841
01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.193
Confuse and terrify them.

842
01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:18.569
And when they're close enough,

843
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:21.618
you'll use your astonishing gift.

844
01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:24.287
And our little puppet
will return to Washington.

845
01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:26.081
Declare martial law.

846
01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:29.455
The most powerful nation on Earth
will be in H.l.V.E.'s control and...

847
01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:33.505
And we will be in
control of H.l.V.E.

848
01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:35.252
What?

849
01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:37.050
Now, Jericho!

850
01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:46.055
Unh... Rose?

851
01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:48.807
I've waited a long time
for this.

852
01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:00.778
Agh. You trained him well.

853
01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:02.404
Better than I knew.

854
01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:03.906
And all of this for what?

855
01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:05.954
Vengeance?
A righteous killing?

856
01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.204
You manipulated me from the first moment
you stepped into my life.

857
01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:13.003
Did you think I didn't know
what you were even then?

858
01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:16.081
I was a father to you.
I trained you.

859
01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:18.086
Helped you master those powers.

860
01:08:18.177 --> 01:08:19.713
A father?

861
01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:23.138
You used a lonely,
grief-stricken girl.

862
01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:25.682
But I wasn't as alone
as you believed.

863
01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:28.886
I had my brother, in here.

864
01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.722
Long before I ever told
you about him.

865
01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:35.354
And I knew what you did to him.

866
01:08:35.445 --> 01:08:38.233
I made you a queen.

867
01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:41.236
And now that queen
is taking your throne.

868
01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:44.034
H.I.V.E. won't use us again.

869
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.613
No one will ever use us,
hurt us, again.

870
01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:50.456
We have the power.

871
01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:54.002
Unh... And what will you do
with all that power, Rose?

872
01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:58.419
I'll start by making you pay
for what you did.

873
01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:00.466
But not with your life.

874
01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:01.918
With your mind.

875
01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:04.095
Take him!
Become him!

876
01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:24.775
Did you really think
I'd unleash a weapon like you

877
01:09:24.869 --> 01:09:27.156
without providing myself protection?

878
01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:30.739
Took my best technicians eight months
to come up with psychic dampers

879
01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:33.791
capable of absorbing
your psionic powers,

880
01:09:33.878 --> 01:09:37.337
and hurling them back
in your astonished face.

881
01:09:42.637 --> 01:09:44.002
You knew?

882
01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.300
I suspected.

883
01:09:46.391 --> 01:09:49.474
After all, a guttersnipe
like you can't be trusted.

884
01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:57.064
Jericho. Jericho?

885
01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:08.239
You should know, Rose,
that family will always disappoint you.

886
01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:12.072
Denied the president's mind,
we'll have to take his body.

887
01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:14.749
I enjoy a good old-fashioned
kidnapping, don't you?

888
01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:18.579
Initiate Plan Jericho Two.
On my...

889
01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:20.584
Sir, another plane,
heading our way.

890
01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:21.961
Who the hell could it...?

891
01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:24.501
Deathstroke.

892
01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:39.732
<i>We warned them.</i>

893
01:10:40.445 --> 01:10:42.231
Why didn't they listen?

894
01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:45.530
By the time our contacts got through
to the people who could make a difference,

895
01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:47.573
it was just too late.

896
01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.576
But we'll damn sure make
a difference here.

897
01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:55.036
These energy readings
are extraordinary.

898
01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:57.788
It's got to be Joseph.
He's in the lead plane.

899
01:10:57.879 --> 01:11:00.541
You gonna be okay
all alone, Grandpa?

900
01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:02.121
Oy, behave yourself.

901
01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:04.548
<i>Have you looked in the mirror lately,
you old bag of wind?</i>

902
01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.091
<i>I've got this, Slade.</i>

903
01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:07.590
You always do.

904
01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:15.142
- You're not talking me out of this.
- I wouldn't dream of it.

905
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:18.347
You're the finest commanding officer
I've ever served under.

906
01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:21.524
And you get extra points
since I've seen you naked.

907
01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.477
Fuck you.

908
01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:42.788
- How did they know?
- They're here now.

909
01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:44.964
And maybe that's for the best.

910
01:11:45.092 --> 01:11:49.711
Wilson's brats may have betrayed me
and ruined my careful planning.

911
01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:52.468
But now their father
can have a front-row seat

912
01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:54.219
when his children die.

913
01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:35.761
What's happening?

914
01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:46.069
Kill them.

915
01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:19.885
Bravo, Rose.

916
01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:21.390
Bravo.

917
01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:56.171
Not bad for an old dog.

918
01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:14.818
No! No, no, no!

919
01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:30.130
<i>Air Force One,
prepare to be boarded.</i>

920
01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:57.023
You just saved the President
of the United States.

921
01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:58.404
Damn right I did.

922
01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.124
It appears we were expected.

923
01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:21.631
Joseph!

924
01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:29.764
So, tell me, Wilson.

925
01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:32.271
Which one do I murder first?

926
01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:35.319
The girl whose mother
you used for your own pleasure

927
01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:37.818
and then so casually threw away?

928
01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:40.616
Or the boy you
so easily abandoned?

929
01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:43.445
Spare me the litany
of my sins, Jackal.

930
01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:45.576
I know them well enough.

931
01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:47.998
Of course.
You're not the only sinner here.

932
01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:51.248
Take our dear friend Rose,
for instance.

933
01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:54.080
She's been manipulating
her brother for years.

934
01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:57.668
Poisoning his mind
against you and Adeline.

935
01:15:57.762 --> 01:16:01.471
Making sure his only
loyalty was to her.

936
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:05.471
I told him the truth.
I love Jericho.

937
01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:08.770
And what's love but another way
to control people?

938
01:16:08.856 --> 01:16:10.096
No.

939
01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:16.145
What you did to him was no different
from what I did to you.

940
01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.854
No.

941
01:16:17.948 --> 01:16:19.814
God, no!

942
01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:22.825
It's not the same, Rose.
You're not the same.

943
01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:27.454
But I did use him. I...

944
01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:30.158
I didn't mean to,
but I did.

945
01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:33.995
Just because love isn't perfect,
doesn't mean it isn't real.

946
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.673
You were there for him,
when I wasn't.

947
01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:39.342
Not for him.
Not for you.

948
01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:46.470
Hardly the time or place
for family therapy.

949
01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:51.854
Let them go.

950
01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:55.979
Say "please."

951
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:59.188
Please.
They've suffered enough.

952
01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:01.113
Then I'll end their suffering.

953
01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:05.076
You fucking monster.

954
01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:08.700
I told you years ago, Wilson.

955
01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.123
We're two of a kind.

956
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:13.201
Get the hell away from my kids!

957
01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:41.396
I've performed several major upgrades
to this armor

958
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.072
since our last battle.

959
01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:44.159
And, now,

960
01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:46.780
I'm unstoppable!

961
01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.473
Not bad.

962
01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:37.295
Thank you.

963
01:18:37.338 --> 01:18:38.874
We've got to help him.

964
01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:47.257
Jericho.

965
01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:50.927
Jericho. Joseph.

966
01:18:51.018 --> 01:18:52.804
I'm so sorry.

967
01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:55.432
-I never meant lo-
-JOSEPH: <i>I know. I...</i>

968
01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.101
<i>Mom?</i>

969
01:18:58.192 --> 01:18:59.682
Hey, little soldier.

970
01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:21.754
All these years, Jackal...

971
01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:24.958
Why? Why me?

972
01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:26.963
Why my children?

973
01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:30.467
Do you think you were the only man
to ever have a daughter?

974
01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:05.965
She was your...

975
01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:08.167
Yes, she was!

976
01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:13.840
And now,
I'll take from you

977
01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:16.016
what you took from me.

978
01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:33.610
No!

979
01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:46.288
Slade!

980
01:20:58.228 --> 01:20:59.764
<i>You were right, Addie.</i>

981
01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:05.980
<i>All these years I've been filing
pieces of myself away in little boxes.</i>

982
01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.277
<i>Lying to myself.</i>

983
01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.650
<i>And to you.</i>

984
01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.402
<i>It was the only way
I knew how to survive.</i>

985
01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:15.234
<i>I'm not a knight,
my love.</i>

986
01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:18.867
<i>I never was.</i>

987
01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:26.546
<i>But maybe now I can be the man
you always needed.</i>

988
01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.842
- Can you?
- I can try.

989
01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:40.684
How long can you keep it there?

990
01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:42.682
<i>As long as I have to.</i>

991
01:21:42.773 --> 01:21:45.014
<i>I'm not losing you again.</i>

992
01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.147
I'll get us down fast.

993
01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:01.952
Wintergreen, can you see them?

994
01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:05.333
No, I.

995
01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:07.332
Wait! There!

996
01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:10.085
You get to ground.
I'll try to reach Slade.

997
01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.046
This has been fun, Wilson.

998
01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:23.344
But it's time to say our good-byes.

999
01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.225
This isn't gonna end well for you.

1000
01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:32.649
Not for you either, asshole.

1001
01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:36.323
What?

1002
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:38.572
<i>Joseph, I love you.</i>

1003
01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:40.949
No!

1004
01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:44.581
Slade!

1005
01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:46.204
<i>Papa!</i>

1006
01:22:55.012 --> 01:22:59.882
<i>"The land was filled with dragons
and the people were afraid."</i>

1007
01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:02.683
<i>But the Shining Knight
came riding forth</i>

1008
01:23:02.769 --> 01:23:05.932
<i>to protect both man and maid.</i>

1009
01:23:06.023 --> 01:23:08.105
<i>He faced the fiercest creatures</i>

1010
01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:10.775
<i>that the world had ever known.</i>

1011
01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:13.569
<i>And he did it all to save us.</i>

1012
01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.521
<i>"For the knight was not alone."</i>

1013
01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:18.529
<i>Oh, how he loved reading
that book to you.</i>

1014
01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:21.656
<i>That...</i>

1015
01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:23.454
<i>That was a long time ago.</i>

1016
01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:28.117
<i>The past is dead.</i>

1017
01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:36.883
He needs time.

1018
01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:39.470
We all need time.

1019
01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:43.049
Do you think he survived?

1020
01:23:43.143 --> 01:23:45.726
Not even he could
have survived that.

1021
01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:54.856
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

1022
01:23:55.405 --> 01:23:56.691
And going where?

1023
01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:02.197
You stay as long as you need to.

1024
01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:03.948
We're family now.

1025
01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:08.328
Dysfunctional <i>as</i> hell,
but we're family.

1026
01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.644
<i>"The land was filled
with dragons,"</i>

1027
01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:39.446
<i>and the people were afraid.</i>

1028
01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:42.275
<i>But the Shining Knight
came riding forth</i>

1029
01:24:42.369 --> 01:24:45.703
<i>to protect both man and maid.</i>

1030
01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:47.575
<i>He faced the fiercest creatures</i>

1031
01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:49.407
<i>that the world had ever known.</i>

1032
01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.457
<i>And he did it all to save us.</i>

1033
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:56.752
<i>For the Knight was not alone.</i>

1034
01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:00.001
<i>And when his work was done,</i>

1035
01:25:01.555 --> 01:25:03.341
<i>the dragons were no more.</i>

1036
01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:06.882
<i>And so the Knight rode on</i>

1037
01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.636
<i>into legend,</i>

1038
01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:11.562
<i>"into lore."</i>
