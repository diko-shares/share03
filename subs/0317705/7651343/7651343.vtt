1
00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.010
- Is this on?
- That's fine.

2
00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:38.704
I can break through
walls, I just can't...

3
00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.873
- That's fine.
- I can't get this on.

4
00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:44.293
Mr. Incredible...
Do you have a secret identity?

5
00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:48.297
Every superhero has a secret identity.
I don't know a single one who doesn't.

6
00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:51.592
Who wants the pressure of
being super all the time?

7
00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.721
Of course I have a
secret identity.

8
00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:59.475
Can you see me in this at
the supermarket? Come on.

9
00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.840
Who'd want to go shopping as
Elastigirl, know what I mean?

10
00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:07.692
Superladies, they're always trying
to tell you their secret identity.

11
00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:10.903
Think it'll strengthen the
relationship or something.

12
00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:16.325
I said, "Girl, I don't want to know
about your mild-mannered alter ego."

13
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.955
I mean, you tell me you're a
super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

14
00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.959
that's all right with me.
I'm good. I'm good.

15
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.086
No matter how many times
you save the world,

16
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.840
it always manages to get
back in jeopardy again.

17
00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:34.385
Sometimes I just want it
to stay saved, you know?

18
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.805
For a little bit. I feel like the maid.
"I just cleaned up this mess."

19
00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.474
"Can we keep it clean
for ten minutes?"

20
00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:42.268
I could
get to that point.

21
00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:45.271
- "Please?"
- We're not finished.

22
00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.691
Sometimes I think I'd just like
the simple life, you know?

23
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.193
Relax a little and
raise a family.

24
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.447
Settle down? Are you kidding?
I'm at the top of my game!

25
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.241
I'm up there with the big dogs!
Girls, come on.

26
00:01:57.325 --> 00:02:00.703
Leave the saving of the world to the men?
I don't think so.

27
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.080
I don't think so.

28
00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.808
We interrupt
for a bulletin.

29
00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:25.978
A high-speed pursuit between police
and armed gunmen is underway,

30
00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:28.481
traveling northbound
on San Pablo Ave.

31
00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:36.071
Yeah, I've got time.

32
00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.641
Mr. Incredible.

33
00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:11.398
- What is it, ma'am?
- My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

34
00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.363
Certainly. I suggest you stand clear.
There could be trouble.

35
00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:18.823
No, he's quite tame.

36
00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:33.879
Let go now.

37
00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.106
Thank you, Mr. Incredible.
You've done it again.

38
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.275
- You're the best.
- No, I'm just here to help.

39
00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.735
All units.
We have a tour bus robbery...

40
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.280
Tour bus robbery.
I've still got time.

41
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.615
Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker.

42
00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.702
- Cool! Ready for take-off!
- What the...

43
00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:07.371
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I'm IncrediBoy.

44
00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:09.039
What? No.

45
00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.333
You're that kid
from the fan club.

46
00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:14.086
Brophy. Brody.
Buddy! Buddy!

47
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.005
My name is IncrediBoy.

48
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.173
I've been nice, I've
stood for photos,

49
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.843
signed every scrap of
paper you pushed at me...

50
00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.554
No, don't worry about training me.
I know your moves,

51
00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.599
crime fighting style, favorite
catch phrases, everything!

52
00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.392
I'm your number one fan!

53
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.439
Hey! Hey, wait!

54
00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:43.782
You know,

55
00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:47.870
you can tell a lot about a woman
by the contents of her purse,

56
00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.915
but maybe that's not
what you had in mind.

57
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.999
Hey, look...

58
00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.881
Elastigirl.

59
00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.050
Mr. Incredible.

60
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.595
- It's all right. I've got him.
- Sure, you've got him.

61
00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.764
- I just took him out for you.
- Sure, you did.

62
00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:09.558
- His attention was on me.
- A fact I exploited to do my job.

63
00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:12.519
- My job, you mean.
- A simple thank you will suffice.

64
00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:14.772
Thanks, but I don't
need any help.

65
00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.815
Whatever happened
to "ladies first"?

66
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.109
Well, whatever happened
to equal treatment?

67
00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.779
Look, the lady got me first.

68
00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:25.032
- Well, we could share, you know.
- I work alone.

69
00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.618
Well, I think you
need to be more

70
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.745
flexible.

71
00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.164
Are you doing anything later?

72
00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.625
I have a previous engagement.

73
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.013
Now, you just stay here.

74
00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:51.058
They usually pick up the
garbage in an hour.

75
00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.769
- Hey, Incredible!
- Hey, Frozone!

76
00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:57.272
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- I still got time.

77
00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.859
He's gonna jump!

78
00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.084
I think you
broke something.

79
00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:20.295
With counseling, I think
you'll come to forgive me.

80
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.172
Wait a minute.

81
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.829
Bomb Voyage.

82
00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.831
Mr. Incredible...!

83
00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.375
And IncrediBoy!

84
00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.085
IncrediBoy?

85
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:04.965
Aren't you curious about how I get
around so fast? I have rocket boots.

86
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.633
- Go home, Buddy. Now.
- What?

87
00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:07.801
Little oaf...!

88
00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.261
Can we talk?

89
00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:11.472
You always say be
true to yourself,

90
00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:14.391
but you never say which
part to be true to.

91
00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:19.271
Well, I've finally figured out who I am.
I am your ward. IncrediBoy!

92
00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:22.399
And now, you have officially
carried it too far, Buddy.

93
00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.693
This is because I don't
have powers, isn't it?

94
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.862
Not every superhero
has powers, you know.

95
00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.739
You can be super without them.

96
00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:32.284
I invented these. I can fly.
Can you fly?

97
00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:34.620
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

98
00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.413
And your outfit is
totally ridiculous!

99
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.792
Just give me one chance! I'll show you.
I'll go get the police.

100
00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.127
- Buddy, don't!
- It'll only take a second, really.

101
00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.546
No, stop!
There's a bomb!

102
00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:48.759
Let go, you're wrecking
my flight pattern.

103
00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:51.720
- I can do this if you let go!
- Will you just...

104
00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:55.015
- I'm trying to help! Stop!
- Let go of my cape!

105
00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:42.938
Take this one home. And make sure
his mom knows what he's been doing.

106
00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.898
I can help you.
You're making a mist...

107
00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:47.067
The injured jumper.
You sent paramedics?

108
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:48.151
They picked him up.

109
00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:50.654
The blast in that building
was caused by Bomb Voyage

110
00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:52.281
who I caught robbing the vault.

111
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.908
We might nab him if we
set up a perimeter.

112
00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.952
- He got away?
- Well, yeah.

113
00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.288
- Skippy here made sure of that.
- IncrediBoy.

114
00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.916
You're not affiliated with me!
Holy smokes, I'm late.

115
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.210
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

116
00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.755
- What about Bomb Voyage?
- Any other night, I'd go after him,

117
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.968
but I really gotta go. Don't worry.
We'll get him! Eventually!

118
00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:21.685
- Is the night still young?
- You're very late.

119
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:25.147
- How do I look? Good?
- The mask. You still got the mask.

120
00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.151
Showtime.

121
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:36.950
Robert Parr, will you have this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

122
00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:40.120
You're late. When you asked if
I was doing anything later,

123
00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:43.540
I didn't realize you'd forgotten.
I thought it was playful banter.

124
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.001
- It was.
- Cutting it close, don't you think?

125
00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.587
You need to be more flexible.

126
00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:51.089
I love you, but if we're
gonna make this work,

127
00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:53.342
you've gotta be more
than Mr. Incredible.

128
00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.469
You know that. Don't you?

129
00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:58.055
So long as you both shall live?
I do.

130
00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:01.016
I pronounce this couple
husband and wife.

131
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.314
As long as we both shall live.
No matter what happens.

132
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:11.568
Hey, come on. We're superheroes.
What could happen?

133
00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:17.658
In a stunning turn of
events, a superhero is being sued

134
00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:21.161
for saving someone who, apparently,
didn't want to be saved.

135
00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:22.913
The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,

136
00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:26.458
who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by Mr. Incredible,

137
00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:30.545
has filed suit against the famed
superhero in Superior Court.

138
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.966
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

139
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.052
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions,"

140
00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:39.471
- causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life!

141
00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:41.807
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

142
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.600
My client
has no comment.

143
00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:48.313
Another suit was filed by
victims of the El train accident.

144
00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:51.483
Incredible's court losses
cost the government millions.

145
00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:55.946
And opened the floodgates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over.

146
00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.993
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

147
00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:04.079
Time for them to
join us, or go away.

148
00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:07.082
Under public pressure,
and the financial burden

149
00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.626
of an ever mounting
series of lawsuits,

150
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:13.755
the government quietly initiated
the Superhero Relocation Program.

151
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.300
The supers were granted amnesty from
responsibility for past actions,

152
00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:21.722
in exchange for the promise to
never again resume hero work.

153
00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.515
Where are they now?

154
00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:27.853
They are living among us.
Average citizens, average heroes.

155
00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:33.275
Quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place.

156
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.237
Denied?
You're denying my claim?

157
00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.866
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

158
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.118
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

159
00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:45.122
but our liability is spelled
out in paragraph 17.

160
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:48.582
- It states clearly...
- I can't pay for this.

161
00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:50.459
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

162
00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:53.128
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

163
00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:55.505
We're now officially moved in.

164
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.382
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

165
00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.801
The last three years
don't count because...

166
00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:03.930
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

167
00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:05.432
Why do we
have so much junk?

168
00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:07.017
Listen, I've got a client.

169
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.187
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

170
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.564
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

171
00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.567
Bye, honey. Excuse me.
Where were we?

172
00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:20.197
I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

173
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:22.324
I don't know what I'll do.

174
00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:33.418
All right, listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

175
00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:37.130
I'd like to tell you to take a copy
of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

176
00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:40.175
Norma Wilcox.
W-I-L-C-O-X.

177
00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.511
On the third floor. But I can't.

178
00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:46.640
I also do not advise you to
fill out and file a WS2475 form

179
00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:48.683
with our legal department
on the second floor.

180
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:52.020
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

181
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.439
I'd like to help, but
there's nothing I can do.

182
00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:55.816
Oh, thank you, young man.

183
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.652
Sorry.
I know you're upset!

184
00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:00.278
Pretend
to be upset.

185
00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.201
Parr!

186
00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.703
You authorized payment
on the Walker policy!

187
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.872
Someone broke into
their house, Mr. Huph.

188
00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:14.042
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know about it.

189
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.963
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping Insuricare in the black.

190
00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.257
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

191
00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:24.719
to every Harry Hardluck and Sally
Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

192
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.891
Morning break is over.
Morning break is over.

193
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:36.481
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

194
00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:40.902
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

195
00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:45.157
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

196
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.617
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

197
00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:50.745
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

198
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.623
Well... Not really. No.

199
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:54.833
Actually, not.

200
00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:56.960
Oh, then how do you
know it was him?

201
00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:59.588
I hid a camera. Yeah, and
this time, I've got him.

202
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:08.471
See? You see?

203
00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.182
You don't see it?

204
00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.769
He moves!
Right there!

205
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:18.273
Wait, wait! Right there!

206
00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:19.983
Right as I'm sitting down!

207
00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:21.776
I don't know how he does it,

208
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.112
but there's no tack
before he moves

209
00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:28.325
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

210
00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.247
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

211
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.458
This
little rat is guilty!

212
00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:40.962
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

213
00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:44.007
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

214
00:14:44.091 --> 00:14:47.719
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

215
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:56.228
Dash, this is the third time this
year you've been sent to the office.

216
00:14:56.312 --> 00:15:00.815
We need to find a better outlet.
A more constructive outlet.

217
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.735
Maybe I could, if you'd
let me go out for sports.

218
00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:05.946
Honey, you know why
we can't do that.

219
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.575
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

220
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.535
Dashiell Robert Parr,

221
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.122
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

222
00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.333
The last thing you
need is temptation.

223
00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:21.795
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

224
00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:24.089
Why can't I do the
best that I can do?

225
00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:26.800
Right now, honey, the world
just wants us to fit in,

226
00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:29.427
and to fit in, we just gotta
be like everybody else.

227
00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:32.430
Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

228
00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:36.101
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

229
00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:38.812
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

230
00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:50.865
Rydinger, where you headed?

231
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.453
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

232
00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:59.291
- "Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?"
- That's kind of funny.

233
00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:02.085
"Hey, Tony, do you
play football?"

234
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.257
Tony, I thought we
were gonna go swimming.

235
00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:10.635
He looked at me.

236
00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:14.556
Come on, Violet!

237
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.041
Darn kids.
Sitting on the driveway...

238
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.461
Oh, great.

239
00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:22.374
Mom.

240
00:17:23.667 --> 00:17:27.295
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, I'm not.

241
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.798
You make weird faces, honey.

242
00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:33.301
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

243
00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:36.388
Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes!

244
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:39.599
Bob, could you help the
carnivore cut his meat?

245
00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:44.938
Dash, you have something you wanna
tell your father about school?

246
00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:47.107
Well, we
dissected a frog.

247
00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:48.817
Dash got sent to
the office again.

248
00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:51.444
- Good. Good.
- No, Bob, that's bad.

249
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:54.697
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

250
00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:56.491
- What? What for?
- Nothing.

251
00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:59.285
He put a tack on the teacher's
chair, during class.

252
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.414
Nobody saw me. You could
barely see it on the tape.

253
00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:05.708
They caught you on tape and you
still got away with it? Whoa!

254
00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:08.253
You must have been booking.
How fast were you going?

255
00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:09.712
We are not encouraging this.

256
00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:12.048
I'm not, I'm just
asking how fast...

257
00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.842
Honey!

258
00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:19.097
Great. First the car, now I
gotta pay to fix the table...

259
00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:20.890
What happened to the car?

260
00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.936
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

261
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.106
So, how about you, Vi?
How was school?

262
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.025
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly touched your food.

263
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.737
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

264
00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:37.782
We have steak, pasta...
What are you hungry for?

265
00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:40.577
- Tony Rydinger.
- Shut up.

266
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:43.621
- Well, you are.
- I said, shut up, you little insect.

267
00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:46.374
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

268
00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:49.711
- Honey!
- Kids! Listen to your mother.

269
00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:53.423
She'd eat if we were
having Tony loaf.

270
00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:55.216
That's it!

271
00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:56.509
Stop it!

272
00:18:57.678 --> 00:19:01.055
- You're gonna be toast!
- Stop running in the house.

273
00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:03.057
Sit down!

274
00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.644
- Hey, no force fields!
- You started it.

275
00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:09.314
You sit down! You sit down!

276
00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:10.773
Violet!

277
00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:18.656
"Simon J. Paladino,

278
00:19:19.783 --> 00:19:23.578
"longtime advocate of superhero
rights, is missing"?

279
00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:28.374
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob! It's time to engage.

280
00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:30.835
Do something!
Don't just stand there!

281
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.880
- I need you to intervene!
- You want me to intervene?

282
00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:35.798
Okay. I'm intervening!

283
00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.511
Violet, let go of your brother.

284
00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:41.429
Hello?

285
00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:44.057
Get the door.

286
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:47.936
- Hey, Lucius!
- Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

287
00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:51.883
- Ice of you to drop by.
- Ha! Never heard that one before.

288
00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.650
Lucius!

289
00:19:53.734 --> 00:19:54.776
Whoa!

290
00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.364
- Ha, ha.
- Oh!

291
00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:02.075
- I like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

292
00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:04.702
- Where are you two going?
- It's Wednesday.

293
00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:08.039
Bowling night. Say hello
to Honey for me, Lucius.

294
00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:10.833
Will do. Good night, Helen.
Good night, kids.

295
00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:18.049
Don't think you've avoided talking
about the principal's office.

296
00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:20.218
Your father and I are
still gonna discuss it.

297
00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:23.054
I'm not the only kid who's
been sent to the office.

298
00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:25.056
Other kids don't
have superpowers.

299
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.185
- Now, it's perfectly normal...
- What do you know about normal?

300
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.646
What does anyone in this
family know about normal?

301
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:35.525
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. I wanna be normal.

302
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:39.445
The only normal one is Jack-Jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

303
00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:42.740
Lucky.

304
00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:45.326
I meant about being normal.

305
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.747
So now I'm
in deep trouble.

306
00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:53.084
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph.

307
00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:56.629
Somehow I managed to find cover.
What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

308
00:20:56.714 --> 00:20:59.257
- He starts monologuing.
- He starts monologuing.

309
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:03.303
He starts this prepared speech about
how feeble I am compared to him.

310
00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:07.682
How inevitable my defeat is, the world
will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

311
00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.017
- Yammering.
- Yammering.

312
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:12.437
I mean, the guy has me on
a platter, and he won't shut up.

313
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:14.772
Municiberg,
we have a 23-56...

314
00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:16.399
23-56, what is that?

315
00:21:16.483 --> 00:21:18.443
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

316
00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:20.653
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

317
00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:23.031
Tell you the truth, I'd
rather go bowling.

318
00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:27.618
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

319
00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:29.245
Just to shake things up.

320
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:33.958
He's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

321
00:21:34.043 --> 00:21:36.419
They're just talking.

322
00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:39.630
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

323
00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:41.966
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

324
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:45.636
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

325
00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:49.140
- You remember Gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

326
00:21:49.224 --> 00:21:52.477
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

327
00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:56.147
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

328
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:58.441
- And we're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

329
00:21:58.525 --> 00:22:01.319
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep doing this...

330
00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:04.822
- We have a report on a fire...
- A fire. We're close!

331
00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:07.575
- Yeah, baby!
- We're gonna get caught.

332
00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:12.997
Fire! Yeah!

333
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.257
- Is that everybody?
- Yeah.

334
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.096
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

335
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.432
I can't lay down a layer thick enough!
It's evaporating too fast!

336
00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:33.643
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

337
00:22:33.727 --> 00:22:36.020
- I'm dehydrated, Bob.
- You're out of ice?

338
00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:38.523
You can't run out. You can
use water in the air.

339
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:42.360
There is no water in this air!
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

340
00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:45.363
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

341
00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:48.616
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- I wanted to go bowling!

342
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.997
All right! Stay right on my tail!
This is gonna get hot!

343
00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:09.011
Yeah.

344
00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:14.142
Uh-oh.

345
00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:15.810
Oh, good.

346
00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:19.480
That ain't right.

347
00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:25.319
- We look like incompetent bad guys!
- You can get water out of the air.

348
00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:26.404
Freeze!

349
00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:35.746
- I'm thirsty.
- I said freeze!

350
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:38.666
I'm just getting a drink.

351
00:23:42.588 --> 00:23:47.675
- You've had your drink. Now...
- I know. I know. Freeze.

352
00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:52.263
Police officers!

353
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:06.110
That was way too close.

354
00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:08.905
We are not doing that again.

355
00:24:11.492 --> 00:24:14.452
Verify you want
to switch targets? Over.

356
00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:18.039
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

357
00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:47.401
- I thought you'd be back by 11:00.
- I said I'd be back later.

358
00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:50.154
I assumed you'd be back later.
If you came back at all,

359
00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:54.242
- you'd be "back later".
- Well, I'm back, okay?

360
00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:02.917
Is this rubble?

361
00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:06.420
It was just a
little workout. Just to stay loose.

362
00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:10.174
You know how I feel about that. Darn you!
We can't blow cover again.

363
00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:12.051
The building was
coming down anyway.

364
00:25:12.135 --> 00:25:13.344
What?

365
00:25:13.428 --> 00:25:15.012
You knocked down a building?

366
00:25:15.097 --> 00:25:18.140
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.
It was coming down.

367
00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:20.601
Have you been listening to
the police scanner again?

368
00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:23.729
I performed a public service.
You act like that's a bad thing.

369
00:25:23.814 --> 00:25:25.231
It is a bad thing, Bob!

370
00:25:25.315 --> 00:25:29.485
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

371
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.446
It's better than acting
like they didn't happen!

372
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:35.366
Yes! They happened!
But this, our family,

373
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.911
is what's happening now, Bob.
And you are missing this!

374
00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:42.164
I can't believe you don't want to
go to your own son's graduation.

375
00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:45.251
It's not a graduation. He's moving
from fourth to fifth grade.

376
00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:47.420
- It's a ceremony!
- It's psychotic!

377
00:25:47.504 --> 00:25:50.256
They keep creating new ways
to celebrate mediocrity

378
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.258
but if someone is exceptional...

379
00:25:52.342 --> 00:25:54.594
This is not about you, Bob.
It's about Dash.

380
00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:57.555
You want to do something for Dash?
Let him actually compete.

381
00:25:57.639 --> 00:26:00.433
- Let him go out for sports!
- I will not be made the enemy!

382
00:26:00.517 --> 00:26:03.019
- You know why we can't do that.
- Because he'd be great.

383
00:26:03.103 --> 00:26:05.271
This is not about you!

384
00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:10.901
All right, Dash. I know you're listening.
Come on out.

385
00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:13.237
Vi?
You, too, young lady.

386
00:26:13.322 --> 00:26:15.698
Come on. Come on out.

387
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:19.076
It's okay, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

388
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:20.911
Pretty loud discussion.

389
00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:24.624
But that's okay. What's important
is that Mommy and I are a team.

390
00:26:24.708 --> 00:26:30.588
- We're united, uh, against forces of...
- Pigheadedness?

391
00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:33.215
- I was gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

392
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.968
Everything's okay. Go back to bed.
It's late.

393
00:26:36.053 --> 00:26:37.803
- Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

394
00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:41.349
In fact, we should
all be in bed.

395
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:59.158
Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...

396
00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:01.452
Haven't you got him yet?
Where is he?

397
00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:04.497
Mr. Huph would like to
talk to you in his office.

398
00:27:04.581 --> 00:27:06.707
- Now?
- Now.

399
00:27:25.435 --> 00:27:26.477
Sit down, Bob.

400
00:27:31.692 --> 00:27:36.195
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

401
00:27:36.738 --> 00:27:39.824
- Ask me why.
- Okay. Why?

402
00:27:39.908 --> 00:27:41.701
Why what?
Be specific, Bob.

403
00:27:41.785 --> 00:27:43.452
Why are you unhappy?

404
00:27:43.537 --> 00:27:45.329
Your customers make me unhappy.

405
00:27:45.414 --> 00:27:47.164
What, you've gotten complaints?

406
00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:48.708
Complaints I can handle.

407
00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:52.420
What I can't handle is your
customers' inexplicable knowledge

408
00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:56.465
of Insuricare's inner workings!
They're experts. Experts, Bob!

409
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.552
Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle!

410
00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:02.179
They're penetrating
the bureaucracy!

411
00:28:02.264 --> 00:28:05.015
- Did I do something illegal?
- No.

412
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.353
- We shouldn't help our customers?
- The law requires that I answer no.

413
00:28:09.438 --> 00:28:12.773
- We're supposed to help people.
- Help our people!

414
00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:14.692
Starting with our stockholders.

415
00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:17.194
Who's helping them out, huh?

416
00:28:19.281 --> 00:28:23.617
You know,
Bob, a company...

417
00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:24.952
Is like an enormous clock.

418
00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:29.039
Is like an enormous...
Yes. Precisely.

419
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:34.378
It only works if all the
little cogs mesh together.

420
00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:39.675
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

421
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.764
The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

422
00:28:44.848 --> 00:28:47.016
I'm being
metaphorical, Bob.

423
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.602
Know what I mean by
cooperative cogs?

424
00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:51.395
Bob?

425
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.815
Bob? Look at me when I'm
talking to you, Parr.

426
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.902
- That man out there, he needs help.
- Don't change the subject.

427
00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:01.071
- We're discussing your attitude.
- He is getting mugged!

428
00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:03.699
- Well, let's hope we don't cover him.
- I'll be right back.

429
00:29:03.784 --> 00:29:07.328
Stop right now or you're fired!

430
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:11.999
Close the door.

431
00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:16.086
Get over here, now.

432
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.385
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

433
00:29:24.471 --> 00:29:28.098
- He got away.
- Good thing, too.

434
00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:30.810
You were this close
to losing your...

435
00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:41.195
Uh-oh.

436
00:29:42.906 --> 00:29:46.534
Please report to
operating room 722 immediately.

437
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.708
- How is he?
- He'll live.

438
00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:56.627
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- You think?

439
00:29:56.711 --> 00:29:58.879
- What can I say, Rick?
- Nothing you haven't said before.

440
00:29:58.964 --> 00:30:01.257
- Someone was in trouble.
- Always.

441
00:30:01.341 --> 00:30:04.176
- I had to do something.
- Every time you say that,

442
00:30:04.261 --> 00:30:06.470
it's a month and a half
of trouble for me.

443
00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:08.889
Hundreds of thousands
of taxpayer's dollars.

444
00:30:08.974 --> 00:30:11.475
- I know.
- We pay to keep the company quiet.

445
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.645
We pay damages, erase memories,
relocate your family.

446
00:30:14.729 --> 00:30:17.398
Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money.

447
00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:21.485
We can't keep doing this. We appreciate
what you did in the old days,

448
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.905
but those days are over.
From now on, you're on your own.

449
00:30:28.118 --> 00:30:32.454
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate
you, you know, for old times' sake.

450
00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:35.833
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

451
00:30:35.917 --> 00:30:38.168
I'll make it work. Thanks.

452
00:30:38.253 --> 00:30:40.254
Take care of yourself.

453
00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:54.643
What are you waiting for?

454
00:30:54.728 --> 00:30:58.772
I don't know.
Something amazing, I guess.

455
00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:01.191
Me, too, kid.

456
00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:25.966
Huh?

457
00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:40.230
"Hold still"?

458
00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:42.691
Match, Mr. Incredible.

459
00:31:48.949 --> 00:31:52.117
Room is secure.
Commence message.

460
00:31:52.202 --> 00:31:56.580
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Yes, we know who you are.

461
00:31:56.665 --> 00:31:59.583
Rest assured, your
secret is safe with us.

462
00:31:59.668 --> 00:32:03.170
My name is Mirage.
We have something in common.

463
00:32:03.254 --> 00:32:06.924
According to the government,
neither of us exist.

464
00:32:07.008 --> 00:32:11.512
Please pay attention, as this message
is classified and will not be repeated.

465
00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:14.056
I represent a top secret
division of the government,

466
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.308
designing and testing
experimental technology,

467
00:32:16.393 --> 00:32:19.645
and we have need of
your unique abilities.

468
00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:21.939
Something happened at
our testing facility.

469
00:32:22.023 --> 00:32:23.524
- Honey!
- Huh? What?

470
00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.359
- Dinner's ready.
- Okay.

471
00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:27.987
It is contained within
an isolated area,

472
00:32:28.071 --> 00:32:32.408
it threatens to 'cause incalculable
damage to itself and our facilities,

473
00:32:32.492 --> 00:32:35.244
jeopardizing hundreds of
millions of dollars...

474
00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:36.912
Is someone in there?

475
00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:40.249
- It's the TV, trying to watch.
- Because of its sensitive nature...

476
00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:43.627
- Stop. It's time for dinner.
- One minute!

477
00:32:43.712 --> 00:32:47.631
If you accept, your payment will be
triple your current annual salary.

478
00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:51.552
Call the number on the card.
Voice-matching will ensure security.

479
00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:55.514
The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible.
You're still here.

480
00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.518
You can still do great things.
Or

481
00:32:59.602 --> 00:33:02.771
you can listen to police scanners.
Your choice.

482
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:04.815
You have 24 hours to respond.

483
00:33:04.899 --> 00:33:06.525
Think about it.

484
00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:46.523
This message
will self-destruct.

485
00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:47.649
Uh-oh.

486
00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:08.378
You are one distracted guy.

487
00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:10.297
Am I?
I don't mean to be.

488
00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:16.095
I know you miss being a hero
and your job is frustrating.

489
00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:20.891
I just want you to know how much it
means to me that you stay at it anyway.

490
00:34:20.975 --> 00:34:23.560
- Honey? About the job?
- What?

491
00:34:23.645 --> 00:34:25.896
- Something's happened.
- What?

492
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.606
- The, uh...
- What?

493
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.317
The company is sending
me to, uh, a conference.

494
00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.569
- A conference?
- Out of town.

495
00:34:32.654 --> 00:34:34.154
I'm gonna be gone
for a few days.

496
00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:38.784
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

497
00:34:38.868 --> 00:34:39.910
Yes.

498
00:34:39.994 --> 00:34:43.122
You see? They're finally
recognizing your talents.

499
00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:44.748
- You're moving up.
- Yes.

500
00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:47.960
- Honey! This is wonderful!
- Yes, it is.

501
00:34:50.004 --> 00:34:51.255
Hello?

502
00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:53.340
This is Mr. Incredible.

503
00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:55.175
I'm in.

504
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:05.561
The Omnidroid 9000 is a top
secret prototype battle robot.

505
00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:09.064
Its artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

506
00:35:09.149 --> 00:35:12.025
it's confronted with.
And, unfortunately...

507
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.654
Let me guess. It got smart enough to
wonder why it had to take orders.

508
00:35:15.738 --> 00:35:19.825
We lost control. Now it's loose in the
jungle, threatening our facility.

509
00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:23.078
We've had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.

510
00:35:23.163 --> 00:35:24.163
How am I going in?

511
00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:28.125
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5,000 feet.

512
00:35:28.209 --> 00:35:31.628
Its cloaking devices make
it difficult to track.

513
00:35:31.713 --> 00:35:34.840
We're pretty sure it's on the
Southern half of the island.

514
00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:38.886
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

515
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.346
You want me to shut it down
without destroying it.

516
00:35:42.098 --> 00:35:43.974
You are Mr. Incredible.

517
00:36:03.077 --> 00:36:05.662
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

518
00:36:05.747 --> 00:36:09.499
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

519
00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:11.752
Shut it down. Do it quickly.
Don't destroy it.

520
00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:15.339
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

521
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.079
Showtime.

522
00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:33.166
Huh?

523
00:37:35.003 --> 00:37:36.712
Hmm.

524
00:37:52.186 --> 00:37:53.186
Uh-oh.

525
00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:56.458
Oh, my back!

526
00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:19.022
Oh!

527
00:40:04.485 --> 00:40:07.696
Surprising. We must
bring him back.

528
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.616
Sound the all clear, and
invite him to dinner.

529
00:40:30.553 --> 00:40:33.263
Most
important, keep things light.

530
00:40:33.347 --> 00:40:37.267
Praise him. Make him feel like
we appreciate his abilities.

531
00:40:38.644 --> 00:40:39.895
Am I overdressed?

532
00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:42.564
Actually, you look
rather dashing.

533
00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:45.692
- I take it our host is...
- I'm sorry.

534
00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:48.945
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

535
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:52.824
Of course. I do usually make it a
point to know who I'm working for.

536
00:40:52.909 --> 00:40:55.911
He prefers a certain
amount of anonymity.

537
00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:58.330
Surely, you of all
people understand that.

538
00:40:58.414 --> 00:41:03.084
I was just wondering, of all the
places to settle down, why live...

539
00:41:03.169 --> 00:41:07.464
With a volcano?
He's attracted to power. So am I.

540
00:41:07.548 --> 00:41:11.343
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

541
00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:14.638
I prefer to think of
it as misunderstood.

542
00:41:15.223 --> 00:41:16.306
Aren't we all?

543
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.100
Volcanic soil is among the
most fertile on Earth.

544
00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:22.312
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

545
00:41:22.396 --> 00:41:26.650
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

546
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:51.735
- Jeez.
- Hurry, honey.

547
00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:54.154
Or you'll be late for work.

548
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.616
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

549
00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.577
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

550
00:43:00.661 --> 00:43:02.704
All that jazz.

551
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:11.713
You have an appointment?

552
00:43:11.797 --> 00:43:13.632
I'm an old friend.
I just wanted to...

553
00:43:13.716 --> 00:43:17.636
- All visitors are required...
- Go check the electric fence.

554
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.763
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?

555
00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:25.060
My God, you've gotten fat.
Come in. Come, come.

556
00:43:32.652 --> 00:43:37.072
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

557
00:43:37.156 --> 00:43:41.451
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

558
00:43:41.535 --> 00:43:44.329
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prayge... Prague?

559
00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:46.748
Milan, darling. Milan.

560
00:43:46.832 --> 00:43:50.794
Supermodels.
Nothing super about them.

561
00:43:50.878 --> 00:43:53.046
Spoiled, stupid,
little stick figures

562
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.674
with poofy lips who think
only about themselves.

563
00:43:55.758 --> 00:43:59.678
Feh!
I used to design for gods.

564
00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:05.850
But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh?
I was surprised to get your call.

565
00:44:05.935 --> 00:44:08.269
E, I just need a patch job.

566
00:44:08.354 --> 00:44:11.648
Hmm. This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

567
00:44:11.732 --> 00:44:16.277
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

568
00:44:16.362 --> 00:44:18.947
Moonlighting hero work?

569
00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:20.865
Must have happened
a long time ago.

570
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:23.993
I see. This is a
hobo suit, darling.

571
00:44:24.078 --> 00:44:26.579
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

572
00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:30.834
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

573
00:44:30.918 --> 00:44:34.045
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

574
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:36.756
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

575
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:39.342
A new suit? Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

576
00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:41.845
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

577
00:44:41.929 --> 00:44:44.139
So ask me now, before
I again become sane.

578
00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:47.100
Wait. You want to
make me a suit?

579
00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:50.520
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

580
00:44:51.272 --> 00:44:53.690
- It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

581
00:44:53.774 --> 00:44:54.983
Heroic!

582
00:44:55.067 --> 00:44:58.695
Yeah, something
classic, like Dynaguy!

583
00:44:58.779 --> 00:45:02.449
Oh! He had a great look! Oh,
the cape and the boots...

584
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:03.575
No capes!

585
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:08.747
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

586
00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:11.583
Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.

587
00:45:11.667 --> 00:45:14.961
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

588
00:45:16.422 --> 00:45:18.506
All was well,
another day saved

589
00:45:18.591 --> 00:45:21.384
when his cape snagged
on a missile fin.

590
00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:23.803
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

591
00:45:23.888 --> 00:45:24.888
Stratogale!

592
00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:30.268
April 23rd, '57.
Cape caught in a jet turbine.

593
00:45:30.352 --> 00:45:32.645
You can't generalize
about these things.

594
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.024
Meta-Man. Express elevator.
Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.

595
00:45:36.108 --> 00:45:39.903
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

596
00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:43.406
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

597
00:45:43.491 --> 00:45:45.533
You know I'm retired
from hero work.

598
00:45:45.618 --> 00:45:48.870
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

599
00:45:48.954 --> 00:45:53.333
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

600
00:45:54.168 --> 00:45:57.504
Fine. I will
also fix the hobo suit.

601
00:45:58.255 --> 00:46:02.175
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

602
00:46:15.564 --> 00:46:17.482
Don't answer it,
honey, I got it!

603
00:46:17.566 --> 00:46:20.318
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

604
00:46:24.503 --> 00:46:27.343
- How soon can you get here?
- I'll leave tomorrow morning.

605
00:46:27.368 --> 00:46:29.118
- See you there.
- Goodbye.

606
00:46:31.914 --> 00:46:34.624
Who was that, honey?
The, uh, office?

607
00:46:34.708 --> 00:46:37.627
Another conference.
Short notice, but, you know,

608
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:39.546
duty calls.

609
00:46:47.429 --> 00:46:49.389
- Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

610
00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.977
- Ha... Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

611
00:46:54.061 --> 00:46:56.646
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

612
00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:00.900
- So much.
- I love you, too.

613
00:47:14.039 --> 00:47:15.999
This is
your automated Captain.

614
00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:19.252
Would you care for more mimosa?

615
00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:22.505
- Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

616
00:47:24.133 --> 00:47:28.803
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.

617
00:47:34.768 --> 00:47:38.521
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.

618
00:48:03.422 --> 00:48:06.549
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

619
00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:07.925
Thanks.

620
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.762
Nice to be back, Mirage.

621
00:48:36.622 --> 00:48:40.291
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at 2:00.

622
00:48:40.376 --> 00:48:43.795
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

623
00:48:43.879 --> 00:48:45.380
See you there.

624
00:49:18.205 --> 00:49:19.330
Edna.

625
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.291
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- This is Edna.

626
00:49:22.376 --> 00:49:25.086
- E? This is Helen.
- Helen who?

627
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:28.423
Helen Parr?
You know...

628
00:49:29.675 --> 00:49:30.675
Elastigirl?

629
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:34.971
Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!

630
00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:36.806
It's been a while.

631
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:38.410
There's only one
person Bob would trust

632
00:49:38.434 --> 00:49:40.143
to patch his supersuit.
That's you.

633
00:49:40.227 --> 00:49:42.186
Yes, yes, yes.
Marvelous, isn't it?

634
00:49:42.271 --> 00:49:45.440
Much better than those horrible
pajamas he used to wear.

635
00:49:45.524 --> 00:49:48.025
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

636
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.194
- I'm calling about...
- Don't make me beg.

637
00:49:50.279 --> 00:49:51.779
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg?

638
00:49:52.197 --> 00:49:54.490
No, I'm calling about suit.

639
00:49:54.575 --> 00:49:57.326
Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

640
00:49:57.411 --> 00:50:01.205
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

641
00:50:14.636 --> 00:50:15.720
Hmm.

642
00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:33.946
It's bigger!

643
00:50:35.908 --> 00:50:37.325
It's badder!

644
00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:43.915
Ladies and gentlemen, it's
too much for Mr. Incredible!

645
00:50:45.918 --> 00:50:47.710
It's finally ready.

646
00:50:47.795 --> 00:50:52.173
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

647
00:50:52.257 --> 00:50:55.718
but, man, it wasn't good enough!

648
00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:59.806
After you trashed the last one, I had
to make some major modifications.

649
00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.975
Sure it was difficult,
but you are worth it.

650
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:07.230
I mean, after all, I
am your biggest fan.

651
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:11.818
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

652
00:51:12.444 --> 00:51:14.654
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

653
00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:18.199
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

654
00:51:18.283 --> 00:51:21.536
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

655
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:24.288
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

656
00:51:24.373 --> 00:51:28.125
It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

657
00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:30.169
You can't count on anyone.

658
00:51:30.462 --> 00:51:32.171
Especially your heroes.

659
00:51:32.256 --> 00:51:35.550
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

660
00:51:35.634 --> 00:51:39.053
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

661
00:51:39.137 --> 00:51:40.596
That's the way it works.

662
00:51:40.681 --> 00:51:43.432
There's a lot of people, whole
countries who want respect.

663
00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:46.102
And they will pay through
the nose to get it.

664
00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:48.771
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

665
00:51:48.856 --> 00:51:52.900
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

666
00:51:54.903 --> 00:51:57.780
You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

667
00:51:57.865 --> 00:51:59.699
I can't believe it.

668
00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:06.914
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.
I save the best inventions for myself.

669
00:52:07.749 --> 00:52:09.542
Am I good enough now?

670
00:52:11.044 --> 00:52:12.628
Who's super now?

671
00:52:12.713 --> 00:52:15.214
I'm Syndrome!
Your Nemesis and...

672
00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:18.467
Oh, brilliant!

673
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:38.905
All right, try this one
on for size, big boy.

674
00:53:14.274 --> 00:53:16.108
Gazerbeam.

675
00:53:28.121 --> 00:53:29.455
Kronos?

676
00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:59.485
Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.

677
00:54:02.864 --> 00:54:07.201
This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

678
00:54:07.285 --> 00:54:11.539
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

679
00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:15.918
Simple, elegant, yet bold.
You will die.

680
00:54:16.003 --> 00:54:17.837
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

681
00:54:17.963 --> 00:54:21.465
and it turned out so
beautiful, I had to continue.

682
00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:25.344
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

683
00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:27.722
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

684
00:54:27.806 --> 00:54:30.725
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

685
00:54:30.809 --> 00:54:32.893
That is why I show you my work.

686
00:54:33.186 --> 00:54:34.687
That is why you are here.

687
00:54:41.737 --> 00:54:43.529
Edna Mode.

688
00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:46.282
And guest.

689
00:55:03.383 --> 00:55:04.925
Come. Sit.

690
00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:11.640
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

691
00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:14.477
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

692
00:55:14.561 --> 00:55:18.564
Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

693
00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:21.567
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

694
00:55:22.277 --> 00:55:26.572
And can also withstand a
temperature of over 1000 degrees.

695
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:30.743
Completely bulletproof.

696
00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:35.706
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

697
00:55:36.083 --> 00:55:38.709
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

698
00:55:38.794 --> 00:55:42.922
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

699
00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:46.175
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

700
00:55:46.259 --> 00:55:48.803
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

701
00:55:48.887 --> 00:55:50.679
Well, he'll look
fabulous anyway.

702
00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:56.727
Your boy's suit I designed to
withstand enormous friction

703
00:55:56.812 --> 00:56:00.397
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

704
00:56:01.441 --> 00:56:03.818
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

705
00:56:03.902 --> 00:56:09.281
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

706
00:56:12.828 --> 00:56:17.206
Your suit can stretch as far as you
can, without injuring yourself,

707
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:19.333
and still retain its shape.

708
00:56:20.127 --> 00:56:22.378
Virtually indestructible,

709
00:56:23.421 --> 00:56:26.132
yet it breathes like
Egyptian cotton.

710
00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:29.802
As an extra feature, each suit
contains a homing device,

711
00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:34.140
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

712
00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:38.269
Well, darling?
What do you think?

713
00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:42.898
What do I think? Bob is retired!
I'm retired!

714
00:56:42.983 --> 00:56:44.483
Our family is underground.

715
00:56:44.568 --> 00:56:47.736
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

716
00:56:47.821 --> 00:56:50.364
Well, I assumed you
knew, darling.

717
00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:53.325
Why would he keep
secrets from you?

718
00:56:53.618 --> 00:56:56.036
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

719
00:56:56.663 --> 00:57:00.040
Men at Robert's age
are often unstable.

720
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.586
- Prone to weakness.
- What are you saying?

721
00:57:03.962 --> 00:57:06.213
Do you know where he is?

722
00:57:06.298 --> 00:57:09.216
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

723
00:58:40.725 --> 00:58:43.852
- Hey, hey. We got a man down!
- Come on, let's go.

724
00:58:48.108 --> 00:58:50.276
Are you okay?
What happened?

725
00:58:52.737 --> 00:58:55.948
Break surveillance and engage.
Continuing sweep...

726
01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:40.177
- Insuricare.
- Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

727
01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:41.804
Bob Parr is my husband.

728
01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:45.140
I was wondering if you could give me the
number of the hotel he's staying at?

729
01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:49.603
- The number I have is no good.
- Mr. Parr no longer works here.

730
01:00:49.687 --> 01:00:52.981
What do you mean? He's on a business trip.
A company retreat.

731
01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:56.110
My records say he was terminated
almost two months ago.

732
01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.768
So, you don't know where he is.

733
01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:35.107
Would you like to find out?

734
01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:56.521
I am such an idiot.
I let this happen, you know.

735
01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.235
The new sports car, the getting in
shape, the blond hair, the lies.

736
01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:04.196
Yes, he attempts to
relive the past.

737
01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.659
Now I'm losing him! What'll I do?
What'll I do?

738
01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:11.203
What are you talking about?

739
01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:16.917
You are Elastigirl! My God!
Pull yourself together.

740
01:03:17.001 --> 01:03:19.086
What will you do?
Is this a question?

741
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.630
Show him you remember that
he is Mr. Incredible,

742
01:03:21.714 --> 01:03:24.675
and you will remind
him who you are!

743
01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:29.054
Well, you know where he is. Go!
Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

744
01:03:29.722 --> 01:03:33.058
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

745
01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:35.727
There's lots of leftovers
that you can reheat.

746
01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:40.148
Make sure Dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

747
01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:42.109
I should be back tonight. Late.

748
01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:43.568
You can be in charge
that long, can't you?

749
01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:46.822
Yeah. But why am I
in charge again?

750
01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:49.324
Nothing. Just a little
trouble with Daddy.

751
01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:53.704
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

752
01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:57.624
I mean either he's in
trouble, or he's going to be.

753
01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.800
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

754
01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:09.011
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

755
01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:10.512
We all get cool outfits?

756
01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.598
Dash! You come back
here this moment!

757
01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.520
Hey, Snug.
Thanks for getting back.

758
01:04:18.604 --> 01:04:21.398
I know this is short notice, but
I was hoping that I could...

759
01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:24.443
- What are these?
- Look, I'm The Dash!

760
01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:27.279
- The Dash likes.
- Just a second.

761
01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:31.533
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

762
01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:34.411
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

763
01:04:34.495 --> 01:04:36.705
- Dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

764
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:40.125
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

765
01:04:42.628 --> 01:04:44.671
What makes you think
it's special?

766
01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:47.507
I don't know.
Why'd Mom try to hide it?

767
01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:59.436
Snug, I'm calling in
a solid you owe me.

768
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.148
- What do you need?
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

769
01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:05.317
Let me think.

770
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.120
Island approach. India Golf
niner-niner checking in.

771
01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:18.914
VFR on top. Over.

772
01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:24.628
Island tower, this is
India Golf niner-niner

773
01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:27.047
requesting vectors
to the initial.

774
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.976
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

775
01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:44.314
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

776
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:49.444
At the same time. Yeah.

777
01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:08.213
You, sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible."
I was right to idolize you.

778
01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:11.133
I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

779
01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:15.178
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!

780
01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:17.681
I'm still geeking out about it!

781
01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:22.519
And then you had to just
go and ruin the ride.

782
01:06:22.603 --> 01:06:27.524
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help?
"Help me, help me."

783
01:06:27.608 --> 01:06:30.068
Lame, lame, lame.

784
01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:31.570
All right, who did you contact?

785
01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.489
Contact? What are
you talking about?

786
01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:42.664
I am referring to last
night at 23:07 hours

787
01:06:42.748 --> 01:06:45.876
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

788
01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.920
I didn't know about
the homing device.

789
01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:57.471
And now a government plane is
requesting permission to land here.

790
01:06:57.555 --> 01:06:58.555
Who did you contact?

791
01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.682
I didn't send for a plane.

792
01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:02.684
Play the transmission.

793
01:07:03.936 --> 01:07:07.314
- India Golf checking in.
- Helen!

794
01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.484
So you do know these people.

795
01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:13.695
Well, then, I'll send
them a little greeting.

796
01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:18.200
- Ow!
- Violet!

797
01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:19.743
It's not my fault.

798
01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:21.870
Dash ran away, I knew
I'd get blamed for it.

799
01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:23.788
That's not true!

800
01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:26.313
You said, "Something's up with Mom.
We have to find out what."

801
01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:30.212
and it's not my fault!
Hundred percent allyours idea!

802
01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:33.131
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

803
01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:36.343
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

804
01:07:36.427 --> 01:07:38.720
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!

805
01:07:38.804 --> 01:07:41.598
All right, well, who'd you get?

806
01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:44.059
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

807
01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:47.437
I've got baby-sitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,

808
01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:51.107
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

809
01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:53.401
I brought Mozart to
play while he sleeps

810
01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:56.363
because leading experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.

811
01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:57.656
- Kari...
- The beauty is

812
01:07:57.698 --> 01:08:00.408
they don't have to listen
'cause they're asleep!

813
01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:02.577
I wish my parents played Mozart

814
01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:05.664
because half the time I don't
know what anyone's talking about.

815
01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:09.376
Kari, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

816
01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:12.379
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.

817
01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.422
There's really no
need, Mrs. Parr.

818
01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:17.217
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.

819
01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:20.053
Can't I, little baby?
I can handle it.

820
01:08:20.137 --> 01:08:22.055
Who can handle it?

821
01:08:29.730 --> 01:08:32.274
India Golf niner-niner
transmitting in the blind guard.

822
01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:35.527
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

823
01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.599
Repeat, disengage.

824
01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:07.892
- Friendlies...
- No!

825
01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.538
Call off the missiles.
I'll do anything.

826
01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:12.897
Too late.
Fifteen years too late.

827
01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:17.777
Friendlies two-zero Miles
South-southwest of your position.

828
01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:20.155
Angels 10. Track east.
Disengage.

829
01:09:20.239 --> 01:09:22.782
Vi! Put a force field
around the plane.

830
01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:24.617
You said not to use our powers.

831
01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:27.162
I know what I said.
Listen to what I'm saying now!

832
01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:29.289
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!

833
01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:35.128
Mom?

834
01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:36.755
Violet!

835
01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:40.258
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner
is buddy-spiked. Abort!

836
01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:41.843
There are children aboard.

837
01:09:41.927 --> 01:09:43.636
- There are children aboard!
- No!

838
01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:46.931
Put a field around us now!

839
01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:48.475
I've never done one that big.

840
01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:49.642
Do it now!

841
01:09:51.228 --> 01:09:56.524
Abort, abort, abort!

842
01:10:27.681 --> 01:10:29.474
Brace yourselves!

843
01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:38.775
- Mom!
- Everybody calm down.

844
01:10:38.859 --> 01:10:40.568
I'll tell you what
we're not gonna do.

845
01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:43.238
We're not gonna panic, we're not...
Look out!

846
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.168
- Oh, my God! Whose idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

847
01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.754
We're dead!
We're dead!

848
01:10:59.839 --> 01:11:02.757
- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!

849
01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:04.175
Stop it!

850
01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.553
We are not gonna die!

851
01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:08.596
Both of you will get a grip.

852
01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:11.099
Or so help me I will
ground you for a month!

853
01:11:11.308 --> 01:11:12.684
Understand?

854
01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:17.605
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.

855
01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:19.732
Ah, you'll get over it.

856
01:11:20.025 --> 01:11:23.403
I seem to recall you
prefer to "work alone."

857
01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.540
Release me. Now!

858
01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:37.125
Or what?

859
01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:38.751
I'll crush her.

860
01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:41.671
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.

861
01:11:41.755 --> 01:11:44.632
It'll be easy.
Like breaking a toothpick.

862
01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:46.718
Show me.

863
01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:01.357
I knew you
couldn't do it.

864
01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:04.194
Even when you have
nothing to lose.

865
01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:05.737
You're weak.

866
01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:08.531
And I've outgrown you.

867
01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:22.212
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based.

868
01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.214
That way is our best bet.

869
01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:27.091
You want to go toward the
people that tried to kill us?

870
01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:31.179
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?

871
01:12:31.263 --> 01:12:34.098
I expect you to trust me.

872
01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:37.328
What a trooper.

873
01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:39.956
I'm so proud of you.

874
01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:41.874
Thanks, Mom.

875
01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:50.425
I think your father
is in trouble.

876
01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:53.511
If you haven't noticed, we're
not doing so hot either.

877
01:13:53.887 --> 01:13:55.096
I'm going to look for him.

878
01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:57.974
And that means you're in charge
until I get back, Violet.

879
01:13:58.058 --> 01:14:00.310
- What?
- You heard her.

880
01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:06.316
Put these on. Your identity is
your most valuable possession.

881
01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:07.650
Protect it.

882
01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:09.819
And if anything goes
wrong, use your powers.

883
01:14:09.903 --> 01:14:13.156
- But you said never to use...
- I know what I said!

884
01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.410
Remember the bad guys

885
01:14:17.494 --> 01:14:20.288
on those shows you used to
watch on Saturday mornings?

886
01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:23.875
Well, these guys are
not like those guys.

887
01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:27.670
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

888
01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:31.007
They will kill you if
they get the chance.

889
01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.384
Do not give them that chance.

890
01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.219
- Mom?
- Vi, I'm counting on you.

891
01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:38.431
- There's...
- I'm counting on you. Be strong.

892
01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:43.853
Dash, if anything goes wrong, I
want you to run as fast as you can.

893
01:14:43.937 --> 01:14:46.773
- As fast as I can?
- As fast as you can.

894
01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:50.485
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.

895
01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:56.074
Mom!

896
01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:59.619
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.

897
01:14:59.703 --> 01:15:02.664
I wanted to help.
When you asked me to... I'm sorry.

898
01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:05.083
Shh. It isn't your fault.

899
01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:08.753
It wasn't fair for me to
suddenly ask so much of you.

900
01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:11.339
But things are different now.

901
01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:14.467
And doubt is a luxury we can't
afford anymore, sweetie.

902
01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:16.886
You have more power
than you realize.

903
01:15:17.388 --> 01:15:19.722
Don't think. And don't worry.

904
01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:22.308
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

905
01:15:23.435 --> 01:15:24.977
It's in your blood.

906
01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:05.643
- He's not weak, you know.
- What?

907
01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:08.020
Valuing life is not weakness.

908
01:16:08.313 --> 01:16:11.899
Hey. Look, if you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,

909
01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:13.693
I had everything under control.

910
01:16:13.777 --> 01:16:16.654
And disregarding it
is not strength.

911
01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:19.490
I called his bluff,
sweetheart, that's all.

912
01:16:19.616 --> 01:16:22.076
I knew he wouldn't have
it in him to actually...

913
01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:24.912
Next time you gamble,
bet your own life!

914
01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.512
Okay, okay, okay.

915
01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:38.402
A rocket?

916
01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:34.834
Hey!

917
01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:36.437
Well, not that this isn't fun,
but I'm gonna go look around.

918
01:19:36.521 --> 01:19:38.272
What do you think
is going on here?

919
01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:40.483
You think we're on vacation?

920
01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:43.694
Mom and Dad's lives
could be in jeopardy.

921
01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:46.030
Or worse,
their marriage.

922
01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:47.907
Their marriage?

923
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:52.703
So, the bad guys are trying to
wreck Mom and Dad's marriage.

924
01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.956
Forget it. You're so immature.

925
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.250
- I'm gonna go look around.
- Mom said to stay hidden.

926
01:19:58.335 --> 01:20:02.171
I'm not gonna leave the cave.
Sheesh.

927
01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:44.213
Cool!

928
01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:48.676
Roger.
We are ready for launch.

929
01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:02.106
- Vi, Vi!
- What did you do?

930
01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:16.787
ETA two-niner.
Over.

931
01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:23.044
TCI clear. Condition yellow.
Status norm.

932
01:21:25.922 --> 01:21:27.840
Not responding to IFF.

933
01:21:27.924 --> 01:21:29.717
IRCM reads negative.

934
01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:32.887
- Bob.
- What?

935
01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:34.221
I didn't say anything.

936
01:22:03.293 --> 01:22:05.211
Identification, please.

937
01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:07.004
Hey!

938
01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:10.091
- Hey, Violet! Come here, look. It talks!
- What? What?

939
01:22:10.175 --> 01:22:11.634
There. That one.

940
01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:13.344
Voice key incorrect.

941
01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:15.012
"Voice key"?

942
01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:17.765
Voice key incorrect.

943
01:22:17.849 --> 01:22:19.517
Wait a second.

944
01:22:21.812 --> 01:22:23.187
- What do we do?
- Run!

945
01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:25.356
- Where are we going?
- Away from here!

946
01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:33.781
Intruder alert.

947
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:58.139
- There isn't much time.
- No, there isn't.

948
01:22:58.223 --> 01:23:00.641
In fact, there's no time at all.

949
01:23:00.725 --> 01:23:02.852
- Please...
- Why are you here?

950
01:23:02.936 --> 01:23:07.940
How can you possibly bring me lower?
What more can you take away from me?

951
01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:11.569
Family
survived the crash.

952
01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:13.654
They're here on the island!

953
01:23:14.114 --> 01:23:15.114
They're alive?

954
01:23:28.879 --> 01:23:30.629
- Helen?
- Hello.

955
01:23:31.214 --> 01:23:32.882
You must be Mrs...

956
01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:36.051
- She was helping me to escape.
- No.

957
01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:39.096
That's what I was doing.
Let go of me!

958
01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:42.266
Let go, you lousy,
lying, unfaithful creep!

959
01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:46.187
How could I betray
the perfect woman?

960
01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:48.105
Oh, you're referring to me now?

961
01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:49.356
Where are the kids?

962
01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:51.233
- They triggered the alert.
- What?

963
01:23:51.318 --> 01:23:54.695
- Security's in the jungle. Get going.
- Our kids are in danger?

964
01:23:54.779 --> 01:23:56.580
If you suspected danger,
why'd you bring them?

965
01:23:56.615 --> 01:24:00.201
They stowed away. You're not
striking the proper tone.

966
01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:09.622
Think they're supers?

967
01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:12.046
Dash, remember what Mom said.

968
01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:13.631
- What?
- Stop talking!

969
01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:16.884
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Dash, run!

970
01:24:16.968 --> 01:24:18.677
- What?
- Run!

971
01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:21.889
- They're supers!
- Get the boy!

972
01:24:23.516 --> 01:24:24.808
Show yourself!

973
01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:26.870
Hey!

974
01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:35.754
Ha, ha!

975
01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.731
I'm alive. Yeah!

976
01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:56.734
Uh-oh.

977
01:27:07.305 --> 01:27:09.598
I should've told you I
was fired, I admit it.

978
01:27:09.682 --> 01:27:10.974
But I didn't want you to worry.

979
01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:12.393
You didn't want me to worry?

980
01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:15.354
We're running for our lives
through some godforsaken jungle.

981
01:27:15.438 --> 01:27:18.649
You keep trying to pick a fight,
but I'm just happy you're alive.

982
01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:23.987
I know you're there,
Little Miss Disappear.

983
01:27:36.167 --> 01:27:38.377
You can't hide from me.

984
01:27:44.467 --> 01:27:46.802
- There you are.
- Hey!

985
01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:52.766
Don't touch my sister!

986
01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:02.776
- How are you doing that?
- I don't know!

987
01:28:02.861 --> 01:28:04.528
Whatever you do, don't stop!

988
01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:23.046
Mom! Dad! Hey!

989
01:28:24.924 --> 01:28:25.966
Kids.

990
01:28:26.050 --> 01:28:27.843
- You're all right.
- You're all right.

991
01:28:27.927 --> 01:28:30.429
- We were so worried.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

992
01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:50.282
I love you.

993
01:28:50.366 --> 01:28:51.867
- Wow.
- Whoa.

994
01:29:06.549 --> 01:29:07.925
Time out!

995
01:29:09.427 --> 01:29:12.888
What have we here?
Matching uniforms?

996
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:17.309
Oh, no! Elastigirl?

997
01:29:18.937 --> 01:29:22.147
You married Elastigirl?
Whoa!

998
01:29:23.274 --> 01:29:25.651
And got busy!

999
01:29:25.735 --> 01:29:30.322
It's a whole family of supers.
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!

1000
01:29:30.406 --> 01:29:32.991
Oh, this is just too good!

1001
01:29:33.076 --> 01:29:36.537
- The ship's unique design...
- There were no fatalities...

1002
01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:41.625
Huh? Huh? Oh, come on!
You gotta admit, this is cool.

1003
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:45.045
Just like a movie!
The robot will emerge dramatically,

1004
01:29:45.129 --> 01:29:47.881
do some damage.
Throngs of screaming people!

1005
01:29:47.966 --> 01:29:52.678
And just when all hope is lost,
Syndrome will save the day!

1006
01:29:52.929 --> 01:29:55.597
I'll be a bigger hero
than you ever were!

1007
01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:59.851
You mean you killed off real heroes
so that you could pretend to be one?

1008
01:29:59.936 --> 01:30:02.688
Oh, I'm real.
Real enough to defeat you!

1009
01:30:02.772 --> 01:30:06.817
And I did it without your precious
gifts, your oh-so-special powers.

1010
01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.068
I'll give them heroics.

1011
01:30:08.152 --> 01:30:11.572
I'll give them the most spectacular
heroics anyone's ever seen!

1012
01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:14.825
And when I'm old and I've had
my fun, I'll sell my inventions

1013
01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:19.246
so that everyone can be superheroes.
Everyone can be super.

1014
01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:22.165
And when
everyone's super

1015
01:30:25.295 --> 01:30:27.004
no one will be.

1016
01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:54.406
Fire at will!

1017
01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:04.541
It's
overwhelming the tanks.

1018
01:31:04.626 --> 01:31:05.834
I'm sorry.

1019
01:31:06.377 --> 01:31:10.088
This is my fault.
I've been a lousy father.

1020
01:31:10.173 --> 01:31:13.967
Blind to what I have.
So obsessed with being undervalued

1021
01:31:14.052 --> 01:31:16.970
- that I undervalued all of you.
- Dad?

1022
01:31:17.055 --> 01:31:18.180
Shh. Don't interrupt.

1023
01:31:18.264 --> 01:31:20.974
So caught up in the
past that I...

1024
01:31:22.894 --> 01:31:26.980
You are my greatest adventure.
And I almost missed it.

1025
01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:29.149
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of this safely if I...

1026
01:31:29.233 --> 01:31:33.236
Well, I think Dad has made
some excellent progress today

1027
01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:35.989
but I think it's time
we wind down now.

1028
01:31:39.243 --> 01:31:40.869
We need to get back
to the mainland.

1029
01:31:40.953 --> 01:31:43.622
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in.
Straight ahead.

1030
01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:54.758
Where are all the guards?

1031
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:56.802
Go, go!

1032
01:32:01.265 --> 01:32:04.101
Hey, every time
they run, you take a shot.

1033
01:32:20.231 --> 01:32:22.512
This is the right hangar,
but I don't see any jets.

1034
01:32:22.537 --> 01:32:25.038
- A jet's not fast enough.
- What's faster than a jet?

1035
01:32:25.998 --> 01:32:27.040
How about a rocket?

1036
01:32:31.170 --> 01:32:34.840
- Great! I can't fly a rocket.
- You don't have to.

1037
01:32:35.425 --> 01:32:37.634
Use the coordinates
from the last launch.

1038
01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:43.098
Wait. I bet Syndrome's
changed the password by now.

1039
01:32:43.182 --> 01:32:45.976
- How do I get into the computer?
- Say please.

1040
01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.910
- Honey?
- What?

1041
01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:05.829
- Where is my supersuit?
- What?

1042
01:33:06.372 --> 01:33:09.583
Where is my supersuit?

1043
01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:12.753
- I put it away.
- Where?

1044
01:33:12.837 --> 01:33:16.173
- Why do you need to know?
- I need it!

1045
01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:19.259
Don't you think about
running off doing no derrin'-do.

1046
01:33:19.343 --> 01:33:21.219
We've been planning this
dinner for two months!

1047
01:33:21.304 --> 01:33:24.681
- The public is in danger!
- My evening's in danger!

1048
01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:28.268
Tell me where my suit is, woman!
We are talking about the greater good.

1049
01:33:28.352 --> 01:33:30.520
"Greater good"?
I am your wife!

1050
01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:33.523
I'm the greatest good
you are ever gonna get!

1051
01:33:37.236 --> 01:33:38.612
Run!

1052
01:33:40.364 --> 01:33:41.698
My baby!

1053
01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:48.747
- The supers have returned!
- Is that Fironic?

1054
01:33:48.831 --> 01:33:52.083
- Fironic?
- No, Fironic has a different outfit.

1055
01:33:52.168 --> 01:33:57.130
No, no, I'm a new superhero!
I'm Syndrome!

1056
01:34:00.092 --> 01:34:01.968
All right, stand back.

1057
01:34:05.681 --> 01:34:10.101
Someone needs to teach this
hunk of metal a few manners.

1058
01:34:11.938 --> 01:34:13.146
Ha, ha!

1059
01:34:40.383 --> 01:34:43.635
- Are we there yet?
- We get there when we get there.

1060
01:34:46.013 --> 01:34:48.098
How you doing, honey?

1061
01:34:48.182 --> 01:34:50.725
Do I have to answer?

1062
01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:56.189
Kids, strap yourselves
down like I told you.

1063
01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.237
Here we go, honey.

1064
01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:03.947
Ready, Violet?

1065
01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:06.950
Ready? Now!

1066
01:35:10.746 --> 01:35:12.289
This is gonna be rough.

1067
01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:22.048
Robot's in the financial district.
Which exit?

1068
01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:23.758
- Traction Avenue.
- That'll take me downtown.

1069
01:35:23.843 --> 01:35:25.723
- I take Seventh, don't I?
- Don't take Seventh!

1070
01:35:26.971 --> 01:35:29.556
- Great, we missed it.
- Ask how to get there, I told you.

1071
01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.433
- Traction.
- That'll take me downtown.

1072
01:35:31.517 --> 01:35:33.143
Get in the right Lane! Signal!

1073
01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:34.769
- Not Traction!
- You're gonna miss it!

1074
01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.674
Is everybody okay back there?

1075
01:36:04.967 --> 01:36:08.511
- Super-duper, Dad!
- Let's do that again.

1076
01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:14.392
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.

1077
01:36:15.478 --> 01:36:17.979
While what? I watch helplessly
from the sidelines?

1078
01:36:18.064 --> 01:36:20.523
- I don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

1079
01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:23.276
And I'm telling you not a chance.
You're my husband.

1080
01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:25.195
I'm with you for
better or worse.

1081
01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:27.280
I have to do this alone.

1082
01:36:27.365 --> 01:36:29.282
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.

1083
01:36:29.367 --> 01:36:31.242
- So you can be Mr. Incredible again?
- No!

1084
01:36:31.327 --> 01:36:32.577
- Then what?
- I'm not...

1085
01:36:32.662 --> 01:36:34.663
- Not what?
- I'm not strong enough.

1086
01:36:34.747 --> 01:36:36.790
- This will make you stronger?
- Yes. No!

1087
01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:38.917
That's what this is?
Some sort of workout?

1088
01:36:39.001 --> 01:36:40.919
I can't lose you again!

1089
01:36:42.588 --> 01:36:45.215
I can't. Not again.

1090
01:36:45.967 --> 01:36:47.801
I'm not strong enough.

1091
01:36:56.519 --> 01:36:59.312
If we work together,
you won't have to be.

1092
01:36:59.397 --> 01:37:00.605
I don't know what'll happen.

1093
01:37:01.315 --> 01:37:03.692
We're superheroes.
What can happen?

1094
01:37:08.406 --> 01:37:10.115
Vi! Dash! No!

1095
01:37:20.001 --> 01:37:21.001
Violet?

1096
01:37:24.505 --> 01:37:26.756
- Dad!
- Go, go!

1097
01:37:36.809 --> 01:37:39.936
- I'm okay, Mom. Really.
- Stay here, okay?

1098
01:37:51.032 --> 01:37:52.365
Frozone!

1099
01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:53.658
Yeah!

1100
01:37:56.454 --> 01:37:57.537
Bob!

1101
01:37:58.914 --> 01:37:59.914
Hey!

1102
01:38:16.182 --> 01:38:17.474
Syndrome's remote!

1103
01:38:27.318 --> 01:38:28.568
The remote controls the robot!

1104
01:38:31.989 --> 01:38:33.156
Throw it, throw it!

1105
01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.491
Go long!

1106
01:38:45.795 --> 01:38:46.920
Got it!

1107
01:38:51.675 --> 01:38:53.760
Honey, take out its guns!

1108
01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:02.102
Gotcha!

1109
01:39:48.190 --> 01:39:49.858
Mom, I've got it!
I've got the remote!

1110
01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:54.237
A remote? A remote
that controls what?

1111
01:39:57.283 --> 01:39:58.283
The robot?

1112
01:40:06.584 --> 01:40:07.709
It's coming back!

1113
01:40:11.088 --> 01:40:12.488
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that!

1114
01:40:14.258 --> 01:40:17.260
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is

1115
01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:22.265
itself.

1116
01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:23.558
It's getting closer!

1117
01:40:23.642 --> 01:40:25.768
- It doesn't work!
- Kids!

1118
01:40:27.396 --> 01:40:28.855
It's not
doing anything.

1119
01:40:28.939 --> 01:40:30.979
- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

1120
01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:37.947
Honey!

1121
01:40:43.954 --> 01:40:46.247
Wait a minute.
Press that button again!

1122
01:40:47.791 --> 01:40:50.376
No, the other one!
The first one!

1123
01:40:50.461 --> 01:40:51.669
First button!
Got it!

1124
01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:53.379
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!

1125
01:40:54.298 --> 01:40:56.966
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

1126
01:40:57.051 --> 01:40:58.801
- Press the button!
- Not yet!

1127
01:40:58.928 --> 01:41:01.387
- Helen!
- What are you waiting for?

1128
01:41:01.472 --> 01:41:03.806
A closer target!
You got one shot!

1129
01:41:06.852 --> 01:41:07.852
Everybody duck!

1130
01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.044
Hey, Zone.

1131
01:41:39.343 --> 01:41:41.177
Huh? No!

1132
01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:45.348
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

1133
01:41:45.432 --> 01:41:49.602
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

1134
01:41:52.648 --> 01:41:55.441
- Just like old times. Oh!
- Just like old times.

1135
01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:57.819
Yeah. Hurt then, too.

1136
01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.533
We've frozen all of
Syndrome's assets.

1137
01:42:03.617 --> 01:42:07.620
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

1138
01:42:07.705 --> 01:42:09.747
The people of this country
are indebted to you.

1139
01:42:09.832 --> 01:42:11.457
Does this mean we can
come out of hiding?

1140
01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:13.584
Let the politicians
figure that one out.

1141
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:17.297
I've been asked to assure you we'll
take care of everything else.

1142
01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:18.381
You did good, Bob.

1143
01:42:19.591 --> 01:42:23.970
Hi, this is Kari. I have a
question about Jack-Jack...

1144
01:42:24.054 --> 01:42:25.430
Come on. We're in a limo.

1145
01:42:25.931 --> 01:42:28.474
Hey, you're wearing
your hair back?

1146
01:42:28.559 --> 01:42:31.394
- Yeah, I just... Yeah.
- It looks good.

1147
01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:34.147
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

1148
01:42:34.231 --> 01:42:36.482
Not as cool as you
running on water.

1149
01:42:36.567 --> 01:42:40.361
That was sweet when you snagged
that bad guy with your arm

1150
01:42:40.446 --> 01:42:43.072
and whiplashed him into
the other guy. Sweet!

1151
01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:45.825
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
- It's me.

1152
01:42:45.909 --> 01:42:49.162
Jack-Jack is fine, but weird
things are happening.

1153
01:42:49.246 --> 01:42:52.874
Jack-Jack's still fine, but I'm
getting really weirded out!

1154
01:42:53.584 --> 01:42:54.959
When are you coming back?

1155
01:42:55.044 --> 01:42:57.462
Aced those guys that
tried to kill us!

1156
01:42:57.546 --> 01:43:01.674
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.

1157
01:43:01.759 --> 01:43:04.344
I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!

1158
01:43:04.428 --> 01:43:07.347
Put that down! Stop it!
You need to call me.

1159
01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:09.432
I need help, Mrs...

1160
01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:11.142
Bob, listen to this.

1161
01:43:11.226 --> 01:43:13.269
I'm gonna
call the police...

1162
01:43:13.645 --> 01:43:15.355
Hi, this is Kari.

1163
01:43:15.439 --> 01:43:19.442
Sorry for freaking out, but
your baby has special needs.

1164
01:43:20.194 --> 01:43:21.778
Thanks for sending
a replacement.

1165
01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:24.072
I didn't call a replacement.

1166
01:43:28.786 --> 01:43:31.913
Shh. The baby is sleeping.

1167
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.834
You took away my future.

1168
01:43:36.919 --> 01:43:40.296
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

1169
01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:43.591
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

1170
01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:47.345
And in time, who knows, he
might make a good sidekick.

1171
01:43:51.850 --> 01:43:55.144
He's getting away, Bob!
We have to do something now.

1172
01:44:10.619 --> 01:44:12.078
What's happening?

1173
01:44:18.001 --> 01:44:21.170
- Stop him! Throw something!
- I might hit Jack-Jack.

1174
01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:26.759
Throw me.

1175
01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:32.598
Bob, throw me!

1176
01:44:38.772 --> 01:44:39.856
No!

1177
01:44:42.192 --> 01:44:45.403
This isn't the end of it!
I will get your son, eventually.

1178
01:44:45.487 --> 01:44:46.863
I'll get your son!

1179
01:44:48.991 --> 01:44:50.199
Oh, no.

1180
01:45:01.712 --> 01:45:04.589
Look at Mommy, honey. Don't look down.
Mommy's got you.

1181
01:45:05.549 --> 01:45:07.425
Everything is all right.

1182
01:45:23.066 --> 01:45:24.692
That's my girl.

1183
01:45:25.277 --> 01:45:27.653
Does this mean we
have to move again?

1184
01:45:31.283 --> 01:45:32.700
Oh, man.

1185
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:35.453
That was totally wicked!

1186
01:45:52.721 --> 01:45:55.181
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?

1187
01:45:55.265 --> 01:45:58.184
- What is that all about?
- I always thought it was more...

1188
01:45:58.268 --> 01:45:59.727
- Hey.
- Hey.

1189
01:45:59.811 --> 01:46:02.522
- You're, uh, Violet, right?
- That's me.

1190
01:46:02.606 --> 01:46:04.565
- See you, Vi.
- You look different.

1191
01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:08.236
I feel different.
Is different okay?

1192
01:46:08.362 --> 01:46:11.614
Hey, different is... Different is great.

1193
01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:13.658
Would you...

1194
01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:15.409
- Yeah?
- Do you think maybe...

1195
01:46:15.494 --> 01:46:17.203
- you and I...
- Yeah?

1196
01:46:17.287 --> 01:46:18.621
- Do you...
- Shh.

1197
01:46:18.789 --> 01:46:21.999
I like movies. I'll buy the popcorn.
Okay?

1198
01:46:22.918 --> 01:46:25.044
A movie.
There you go. Yeah.

1199
01:46:25.128 --> 01:46:27.838
- Wait, so Friday?
- Friday.

1200
01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:35.388
- Go, Dash, go.
- Run!

1201
01:46:35.472 --> 01:46:38.391
Come on, run!
Pick up the pace.

1202
01:46:38.475 --> 01:46:39.517
Run!

1203
01:46:39.601 --> 01:46:40.977
Pull back, pull back!

1204
01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:43.604
Pace it. Slow down
just a little bit.

1205
01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:45.731
- Make it close!
- Second.

1206
01:46:45.816 --> 01:46:48.484
Close
second, yeah!

1207
01:46:53.198 --> 01:46:54.782
That's my boy!

1208
01:46:55.158 --> 01:46:56.826
Dash, I'm so proud of you.

1209
01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:58.790
I didn't know what the
heck you wanted me to do.

1210
01:47:11.842 --> 01:47:14.844
Behold the Underminer!

1211
01:47:15.512 --> 01:47:17.972
I am
always beneath you,

1212
01:47:18.056 --> 01:47:21.017
but nothing is beneath me!

1213
01:47:21.435 --> 01:47:27.064
I hereby declare
war on peace and happiness!

1214
01:47:27.774 --> 01:47:35.774
Soon all will tremble before me!

1215
01:47:40.884 --> 01:48:41.500
