00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:47.965
<i>I was 28 years old when I died.</i>

2
00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:21.581
{\an8}<i>My life started
in the fifth wards in Houston.</i>

3
00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:24.668
{\an8}<i>Those were some of the toughest streets
in all of Texas.</i>

4
00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.171
Come on down.

5
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.298
<i>Nothing ever came easy.</i>

6
00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.009
<i>Every day was a fight.</i>

7
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:56.867
Oh, lord.

8
00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:09.045
We'll have electric
soon as I can manage it.

9
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:20.681
Gloria.

10
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:22.475
Mary.

11
00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:25.354
Here you go, Roy.

12
00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:27.773
And George.

13
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.864
Thank god for the food first, y'all.

14
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:38.617
Bow your heads.

15
00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.704
Heavenly father, thank you for this food.

16
00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:46.542
You know exactly what this family needs.

17
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.086
The lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.

18
00:02:50.087 --> 00:02:51.880
- Amen.
- Amen.

19
00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:01.598
I'm so hungry, I could eat this table.

20
00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:09.231
Thank you, Mary.

21
00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.859
<i>Mary always saw the good in me.</i>

22
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.278
<i>I loved her for that.</i>

23
00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:30.544
Listen.

24
00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:35.299
I'll be going to work all day tomorrow,

25
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:39.428
so you follow Gloria to your new school
in the morning. You hear?

26
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:46.476
If you get held back another year,
you won't ever catch back up.

27
00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.899
So promise me you won't fight.

28
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.861
I promise.

29
00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:25.264
- Good morning, class.
- Good morning.

30
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.768
Everyone turn to page 16 in your books.

31
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.357
Who wants to read out loud?

32
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.796
Jason, take us away.

33
00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:59.508
"Texas is called the lone star state..."

34
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.285
What you looking at, foreman?

35
00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:28.995
Nothing.

36
00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:31.623
What's wrong?
Can't you even afford a piece of bread?

37
00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:36.170
How about this nasty skin?

38
00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:37.795
You want it?

39
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.341
Go get it.

40
00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:46.763
George should change his name
from foreman to "poor-man."

41
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.766
It's foreman.

42
00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:53.145
What's that, poor-man?

43
00:05:58.317 --> 00:05:59.317
What?

44
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:05.532
What's my name now, fool?
Say it! Say my name!

45
00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:16.793
<i>Anger was my answer to everything.</i>

46
00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:21.798
<i>And I couldn't stop myself from fighting.</i>

47
00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:25.010
<i>It was the only thing I did well.</i>

48
00:07:41.837 --> 00:07:43.088
Excuse me, sir.

49
00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:46.008
Hey!

50
00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.927
- No!
- Get down.

51
00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.387
Hold his hands, man.

52
00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:52.472
His wallet.

53
00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:55.642
Surprise, boys.

54
00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.478
Been busy around here, huh?

55
00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:04.443
Police! Stop right there!

56
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.304
They've gotta be somewhere around here.

57
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:43.232
Come on, butch.

58
00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:47.444
Someone said they saw him over there.

59
00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.698
- Let me know what you see.
- Come on, boy. Find him.

60
00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.116
Find him.

61
00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.119
Let's do it, boy. Go.

62
00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:01.250
You got something?

63
00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:03.417
Find him, boy.

64
00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.045
All right. Find him.

65
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.220
We got you. Find him!

66
00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:20.894
- Come on, boy.
- Try the next block over.

67
00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:22.896
Come on, boy.

68
00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.527
Let's go. He can't have gotten far.

69
00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.879
<i>If you left school
and you're between 16 and 22,</i>

70
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.008
<i>job corps will teach you the skills
that can help you get a good job.</i>

71
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:54.719
<i>In job corps,
you live at a job corps center,</i>

72
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.846
<i>get free medical and dental care,</i>

73
00:09:56.847 --> 00:10:00.975
<i>clean clothes, your own bed to sleep in,
three square meals a day.</i>

74
00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:03.186
<i>You even get paid while you're learning.</i>

75
00:10:03.187 --> 00:10:06.106
<i>Just for once, give yourself a chance.</i>

76
00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:09.610
It's called the job corps.

77
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:18.035
You get an education and training,
so you can get a job.

78
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.621
They pay you a little each month too.

79
00:10:23.624 --> 00:10:25.375
And where will they send you?

80
00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:27.836
I don't know.

81
00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.089
Wherever they want, I guess.

82
00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:44.228
Look at me.

83
00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:47.773
You've got more inside
than what you're showing.

84
00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:50.275
I know it, mom.

85
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.448
You wanna do this job corps?

86
00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.033
Yes.

87
00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:01.119
Then do it right, George.

88
00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:04.623
Don't come running back home
'cause you're missing me.

89
00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.001
Finish what you start this time.

90
00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.005
I will.

91
00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:24.267
We will teach you job skills.
We will give you training.

92
00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:27.144
We will teach you respect for yourself,
as well as for others.

93
00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:30.273
We will show you a way forward,
no matter your past.

94
00:11:30.274 --> 00:11:31.358
Come on, son.

95
00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:35.403
Welcome to the job corps,
the start of your now-bright future.

96
00:11:35.404 --> 00:11:36.529
Here's your linens.

97
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.906
Got a name, big guy?

98
00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:40.449
Yeah, I got a name.

99
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.201
George foreman.

100
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.328
Barracks are gonna be
in the southwest corner.

101
00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:45.329
Lights out at 10.

102
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.750
No drinking, no smoking,
no cursing, no women, no fighting.

103
00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:53.546
- Do y'all feed us here?
- Three meals a day at the chow hall.

104
00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:56.091
Served by the one and only Mrs. Moon.

105
00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:15.903
It's just a bed, man.

106
00:13:17.673 --> 00:13:18.841
Turn that off.

107
00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:31.061
- Got something against music?
- Maybe I do.

108
00:13:32.563 --> 00:13:34.063
Are you always this pissed off?

109
00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:35.649
When I'm trying to study.

110
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.292
Now I know why you're here.

111
00:13:56.003 --> 00:14:00.048
I'm here
because I've got unrealized potential.

112
00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:02.133
That's according to my old man.

113
00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:05.012
He said, "don't come home
until you start realizing it."

114
00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:11.351
Let's go challenge c-dorm
to a game, huh? What do you say?

115
00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:17.858
Guess I'll just hit the chow hall.

116
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:19.902
Alone.

117
00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:25.324
Now you're talking.

118
00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:34.540
You probably just left them
in the locker room.

119
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:37.586
No. Somebody stole them.

120
00:14:38.295 --> 00:14:39.837
You gotta calm down, man.

121
00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:44.885
Look, why don't we just report it
to the office right after we eat, okay?

122
00:14:48.347 --> 00:14:50.681
You got me to thank for those brownies.

123
00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:53.310
Why is that? I don't see no apron on you.

124
00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:56.938
Yeah, well, they realized
I'm a whiz with numbers.

125
00:14:56.939 --> 00:15:00.149
So they got me checking
over the order for the whole cafeteria.

126
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.609
Well, I spotted something.

127
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.113
A unit of brownies costs less
than a unit of beans.

128
00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:06.822
So what?

129
00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:10.159
"So what?" So I switched a few numbers
on the weekly ordering sheet.

130
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.705
And under my new cost-cutting plans,
we got a whole lot more brownies.

131
00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:17.376
And a whole lot of less gas.

132
00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:26.592
What?

133
00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:56.915
What are you doing?

134
00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:04.214
Open up!

135
00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:06.048
Open up!

136
00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:13.806
- Take my shoes? You take my shoes?
- No! Please, no!

137
00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:16.268
Give me them! You gonna steal my shoes?

138
00:16:16.894 --> 00:16:18.269
- My mama gave me them shoes!
- No!

139
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.563
What do you think you're doing, corpsman?

140
00:16:20.564 --> 00:16:23.483
- Don't drop me!
- Let go of him! Stop it, stop it!

141
00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:25.611
Go on out of here. Get out of here.

142
00:16:32.201 --> 00:16:33.493
Where you think you're going?

143
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.998
Is that your artwork?

144
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.171
Let's walk and talk.

145
00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:53.095
Mr. Broadus.

146
00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:55.556
That was federal property
you destroyed back there.

147
00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:57.016
I only got two choices.

148
00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:59.435
Either I send you to prison,
or I send you home.

149
00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:01.146
That boy stole my shoes.

150
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.940
My mama worked hard to give me those.

151
00:17:03.941 --> 00:17:06.527
- Where's all that rage coming from?
- I don't have any rage.

152
00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:08.987
Get in the car.

153
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:16.786
In the time you've been here,

154
00:17:16.787 --> 00:17:19.039
you punched out three corpsmen...

155
00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.540
And one innocent door.

156
00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:22.916
They disrespected me.

157
00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.127
The door too?

158
00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.052
You got money for a bus ticket?

159
00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.056
No.

160
00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:42.145
Here you go.

161
00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.667
I can't go home, Mr. Broadus.

162
00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:10.507
I can't.

163
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:13.385
This place...

164
00:18:15.304 --> 00:18:16.555
It's all I have.

165
00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:21.977
Please?

166
00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.138
You ever box?

167
00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:03.809
Just street fights.

168
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.605
I'm talking about boxing, not fighting.

169
00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:08.357
It's a sport.

170
00:19:09.233 --> 00:19:10.442
With rules.

171
00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.530
I heard it on the radio.

172
00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:18.659
I teach it.

173
00:19:22.204 --> 00:19:23.664
You're big enough and ugly enough.

174
00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:26.208
You wanna learn it?

175
00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:29.920
Yes, sir.

176
00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:33.590
Don't make me regret this.

177
00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:43.766
George, this is Royce.

178
00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:45.853
He's gonna be your opponent today.

179
00:19:46.562 --> 00:19:49.022
Don't worry, big man. I'll be gentle.

180
00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:52.985
That's just a sign
of sportsmanship before you fight.

181
00:19:53.569 --> 00:19:55.570
To show that you're not here
to kill each other.

182
00:19:55.571 --> 00:19:57.280
You're just two athletes

183
00:19:57.281 --> 00:19:59.491
trying to find out
who's best at the sport.

184
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:01.743
So to do that...

185
00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:05.913
Boxers touch gloves, like this:

186
00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:07.915
All right? Let's go.

187
00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:10.002
Let's get on up there.
Let me see what you got.

188
00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:32.441
- All right, Royce, show him what's what.
- When I say "time," you come out fighting.

189
00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:40.199
Anyone want action? Want action, huh?

190
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.534
Leroy Jackson, huh?

191
00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.371
Time!

192
00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.085
Get him, Royce! Get him!

193
00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.343
Be still!

194
00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:13.315
Hit him, George.

195
00:21:16.068 --> 00:21:17.109
Move your feet, George.

196
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.614
You keep standing there like a statue
and a pigeon is gonna crap on you.

197
00:21:27.913 --> 00:21:28.913
Get up.

198
00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:33.877
Get out of that ring. Get out that ring.
Ain't no reason to be in that ring.

199
00:21:36.797 --> 00:21:38.090
Attaboy, Royce!

200
00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:52.479
He was lucky! That's all he was.

201
00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:06.117
Listen, son.
I know that's not what you were...

202
00:22:06.118 --> 00:22:07.660
I'm not your son.

203
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:08.995
That's a good thing too.

204
00:22:08.996 --> 00:22:11.205
I wouldn't want
no son of mine calling it luck,

205
00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:12.915
when he got whupped fair and square.

206
00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:15.710
They all laughing at me because of you.

207
00:22:15.711 --> 00:22:17.837
What do you care about what they think?

208
00:22:17.838 --> 00:22:20.299
Six months ago,
Royce didn't know any more than you do.

209
00:22:21.133 --> 00:22:22.134
I taught him.

210
00:22:23.552 --> 00:22:24.761
I can teach you too.

211
00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:32.310
You got a punch, I'll tell you that.

212
00:22:32.311 --> 00:22:33.896
But that's just about all you got.

213
00:22:35.856 --> 00:22:36.856
There you go.

214
00:22:39.902 --> 00:22:41.486
We gotta get you a jab.

215
00:22:47.659 --> 00:22:49.286
We gotta get you some footwork.

216
00:22:50.287 --> 00:22:52.039
We're gonna start out with a punch.

217
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:55.209
All right? Throw a punch.

218
00:22:59.254 --> 00:23:01.089
Now throw the other one.

219
00:23:10.807 --> 00:23:12.600
See what I just did there?

220
00:23:12.601 --> 00:23:15.896
The mind controls the body,
not the other way around.

221
00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:20.192
In every battle,
the greatest foe that we will combat...

222
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.237
Is in here.

223
00:23:24.488 --> 00:23:27.323
You were making fun of Royce
when he was dancing around, wasn't you?

224
00:23:27.324 --> 00:23:29.326
- He was showing off.
- No, he wasn't.

225
00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:32.328
He was trying to force you to go
where he needed you to go,

226
00:23:32.329 --> 00:23:34.873
so he could deliver that punch
that he was setting up.

227
00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:40.045
And he was studying the ring too,
the soft spots, the loose boards.

228
00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:44.132
Not just about punching, George.
It's about thinking.

229
00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:48.679
All right.
Step forward with that left foot.

230
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.765
Now slide that right foot.

231
00:23:52.808 --> 00:23:54.935
Not straight ahead, off to the side.

232
00:23:55.894 --> 00:23:56.894
Put it back.

233
00:23:58.522 --> 00:24:01.275
Here we go. Step forward.

234
00:24:02.568 --> 00:24:03.568
Step back.

235
00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:06.071
Step left.

236
00:24:06.989 --> 00:24:08.198
Step right.

237
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.451
Cut me off. I'm cutting you off.

238
00:24:12.786 --> 00:24:13.787
Cut me off, cut me off.

239
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.039
Good.

240
00:24:42.274 --> 00:24:43.275
Come on.

241
00:24:44.026 --> 00:24:45.944
Come on. Come on.

242
00:24:53.785 --> 00:24:55.953
- Oh, I've seen a woman.
- A woman?

243
00:24:55.954 --> 00:24:58.664
George! Mary, get your brothers in here.

244
00:24:58.665 --> 00:25:00.958
Sonny, Roy, George is on the phone.

245
00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:03.712
- Is that my brother?
- No, no. That's our brother, boy.

246
00:25:04.296 --> 00:25:05.881
Yes, everybody's here.

247
00:25:06.423 --> 00:25:07.590
- Hey, George.
- Hey there.

248
00:25:07.591 --> 00:25:09.426
- We miss you.
- Hi.

249
00:25:12.221 --> 00:25:15.097
- Well, how are you?
- Setting the world on fire.

250
00:25:15.098 --> 00:25:17.141
They raised me 25 cents an hour at work.

251
00:25:17.142 --> 00:25:19.185
Oh, far out.

252
00:25:19.186 --> 00:25:20.937
Out? Out where?

253
00:25:20.938 --> 00:25:24.106
Oh, no. That's just something
they say out here in California.

254
00:25:24.107 --> 00:25:26.026
You can't come back to Texas
talking like that.

255
00:25:31.114 --> 00:25:33.908
- I'm going to the gym a lot.
- Basketball?

256
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:37.161
<i>No, no. I found something better.</i>

257
00:25:37.162 --> 00:25:39.163
I'm learning how to box.

258
00:25:39.164 --> 00:25:41.415
Please don't tell me
you're fighting again.

259
00:25:41.416 --> 00:25:44.252
- No, I'm not fighting.
- Then what do you call it, George?

260
00:25:44.253 --> 00:25:47.213
It's boxing. It's a sport with rules.

261
00:25:47.214 --> 00:25:48.506
And I'm good at it.

262
00:25:48.507 --> 00:25:50.800
God knows I don't want you to be fighting.

263
00:25:50.801 --> 00:25:53.344
God? What's god got to do
with anything, mama?

264
00:25:53.345 --> 00:25:55.263
Don't tell me you gone so far from home,

265
00:25:55.264 --> 00:25:57.431
you don't know
what god's gotta do with your life.

266
00:25:57.432 --> 00:26:00.184
- Mama, I'm just trying... mama?
<i>- Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

267
00:26:00.185 --> 00:26:01.185
Mama?

268
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.647
- George?
<i>- Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

269
00:26:04.523 --> 00:26:07.860
<i>Please deposit 10 cents
for the next minute.</i>

270
00:26:08.902 --> 00:26:11.071
<i>Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

271
00:26:19.746 --> 00:26:21.914
Come on, Royce, put him down.

272
00:26:21.915 --> 00:26:24.333
All right, George. You got this.

273
00:26:24.334 --> 00:26:25.334
Time!

274
00:26:28.922 --> 00:26:31.675
Come on, cut him off! Cut him off!

275
00:26:46.106 --> 00:26:47.357
Oh, yeah!

276
00:26:49.818 --> 00:26:51.320
That's my bunkmate.

277
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.664
I may be a little late tonight.

278
00:27:03.665 --> 00:27:04.958
I know I promised.

279
00:27:05.792 --> 00:27:06.793
I will try.

280
00:27:12.382 --> 00:27:14.927
My wife thinks
I give up too much time to this place.

281
00:27:16.136 --> 00:27:18.555
- You boxed?
- I went professional.

282
00:27:19.181 --> 00:27:21.350
Won my first 24 fights.

283
00:27:22.184 --> 00:27:23.184
And then what?

284
00:27:23.185 --> 00:27:26.730
Unfortunately,
I had to trade one uniform for another.

285
00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:31.067
Hey, I see you're reading the <i>boxing news.</i>

286
00:27:31.068 --> 00:27:33.277
- Yeah.
- You an aficionado now?

287
00:27:33.278 --> 00:27:35.488
- I was looking at Joe Frazier.
- Yeah?

288
00:27:35.489 --> 00:27:36.990
He's real good.

289
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.744
Yeah, I wouldn't mind all this
that he's got.

290
00:27:45.582 --> 00:27:47.709
I wanna be
the heavyweight champion of the world.

291
00:27:50.254 --> 00:27:52.296
Slow down, George. Slow down.

292
00:27:52.297 --> 00:27:54.590
I can't slow down. I gotta speed up.

293
00:27:54.591 --> 00:27:57.969
- You said you can get me some fights.
- I can, and I will.

294
00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:58.971
Okay.

295
00:27:59.513 --> 00:28:02.056
But first, you gotta win some tournaments.

296
00:28:02.057 --> 00:28:05.142
Then we can take aim at the golden gloves.

297
00:28:05.143 --> 00:28:08.437
And after that,
we can set our sights on the Olympics.

298
00:28:08.438 --> 00:28:09.731
Well, when are they?

299
00:28:10.566 --> 00:28:12.483
Next summer, Mexico City.

300
00:28:12.484 --> 00:28:15.444
But we're gonna wait
for the one after that.

301
00:28:15.445 --> 00:28:18.573
That gives you five years
to train and develop.

302
00:28:18.574 --> 00:28:20.241
Five years?

303
00:28:20.242 --> 00:28:21.951
I'll be a old man.

304
00:28:21.952 --> 00:28:23.286
Listen to me, George.

305
00:28:23.287 --> 00:28:25.830
You got a punch like I've never seen.

306
00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:29.333
But even if you trained harder
than any man has ever trained,

307
00:28:29.334 --> 00:28:33.380
there is no way that you can make it
to the Olympics next year.

308
00:28:39.386 --> 00:28:43.097
{\an8}<i>The Russians are dominating here
at the Olympics in Mexico City,</i>

309
00:28:43.098 --> 00:28:45.559
{\an8}<i>three gold medals
to just one for the U.S. team.</i>

310
00:28:46.894 --> 00:28:49.228
<i>The Russians have saved
their best for last.</i>

311
00:28:49.229 --> 00:28:52.691
<i>The legendary Jonas čepulis
has won 203 fights.</i>

312
00:28:53.317 --> 00:28:54.318
Come on, George.

313
00:28:56.361 --> 00:28:59.071
<i>America's final hope,
19-year-old George foreman,</i>

314
00:28:59.072 --> 00:29:01.366
<i>has been fighting for only one year.</i>

315
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:04.994
<i>He would seem to have no chance
at winning gold.</i>

316
00:29:04.995 --> 00:29:06.371
Come on.

317
00:29:06.997 --> 00:29:10.584
<i>I don't think anyone has ever seen
a bigger mismatch in the olympic ring.</i>

318
00:29:11.084 --> 00:29:14.338
<i>What foreman's being asked
to do today is impossible.</i>

319
00:29:15.589 --> 00:29:19.383
<i>The big Russian's setting the tone early,
giving the young rookie a boxing lesson.</i>

320
00:29:19.384 --> 00:29:21.053
Come on, wake up.

321
00:29:23.013 --> 00:29:24.348
Hit him now. Get him now.

322
00:29:27.267 --> 00:29:28.393
Wake up.

323
00:29:34.733 --> 00:29:36.318
<i>Big left hand from George foreman.</i>

324
00:29:36.944 --> 00:29:37.944
You see that?

325
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.782
Yeah! Yes!

326
00:29:42.783 --> 00:29:46.078
<i>The fighting corpsman is turning
the tables on čepulis.</i>

327
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.122
<i>Foreman pouring it on now, landing bombs.</i>

328
00:29:50.123 --> 00:29:52.668
<i>Čepulis looks like
he's in really bad shape.</i>

329
00:30:00.884 --> 00:30:03.762
- Stop, stop! That's it!
<i>- The ref has stopped the fight!</i>

330
00:30:05.097 --> 00:30:08.851
<i>Nineteen-year-old George foreman has
won the gold medal in a stunning upset.</i>

331
00:30:11.645 --> 00:30:12.687
Yeah!

332
00:30:12.688 --> 00:30:15.107
- He won the gold medal.
- Look at him.

333
00:30:18.193 --> 00:30:19.319
God help him.

334
00:30:28.537 --> 00:30:36.537
<i>Foreman! Foreman! Foreman!</i>

335
00:31:07.034 --> 00:31:09.369
- Hey, George.
- Hey, what's going on, brother?

336
00:31:13.624 --> 00:31:14.624
Hey, tuck.

337
00:31:16.168 --> 00:31:19.253
- Hey, brother. What's going on?
- What's up, George?

338
00:31:19.254 --> 00:31:20.254
Hey.

339
00:31:23.008 --> 00:31:24.884
You can go ahead and touch it, man.

340
00:31:24.885 --> 00:31:26.220
It's heavy though.

341
00:31:27.012 --> 00:31:29.431
Yeah, I bet it's heavy, all right.

342
00:31:31.058 --> 00:31:32.684
What's that 'posed to mean?

343
00:31:33.435 --> 00:31:38.524
Man, I don't see how you can hold
that American flag all up high like you do

344
00:31:39.024 --> 00:31:41.693
when our brothers, shoot, our brothers,

345
00:31:42.402 --> 00:31:45.405
they was doing their thing over there.

346
00:31:51.703 --> 00:31:54.205
They was standing up for all us back here.

347
00:31:54.206 --> 00:31:55.748
And what were you doing?

348
00:31:55.749 --> 00:31:58.585
Standing up for a country
that don't love you back.

349
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:00.754
That's heavy.

350
00:32:15.394 --> 00:32:16.978
You gotta let this go.

351
00:32:16.979 --> 00:32:20.189
If anybody ever talk to me
about that flag again,

352
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:22.191
they not gonna get away with it.

353
00:32:22.192 --> 00:32:24.111
They acting like I'm some kind of sellout.

354
00:32:25.529 --> 00:32:27.822
Let me make you something to eat.
Anything you want.

355
00:32:27.823 --> 00:32:28.907
I'm not hungry.

356
00:32:29.992 --> 00:32:33.954
Let the lord take me now.
I never thought I'd hear that from you.

357
00:32:47.301 --> 00:32:49.927
You left here with nothing to your name,

358
00:32:49.928 --> 00:32:51.972
and you came back with gold.

359
00:32:52.598 --> 00:32:55.184
Then how come
all anybody wanna talk about is the flag?

360
00:32:56.977 --> 00:32:58.436
You know what I'm gonna do?

361
00:32:58.437 --> 00:33:01.147
I'm gonna win the championship belt.

362
00:33:01.148 --> 00:33:04.318
- And they'll respect me then.
- You gonna keep fighting?

363
00:33:05.652 --> 00:33:06.903
You gonna get hurt.

364
00:33:06.904 --> 00:33:09.698
Didn't you watch me? They don't hurt me.

365
00:33:10.407 --> 00:33:11.532
I hurt them.

366
00:33:11.533 --> 00:33:15.120
And that's all you wanna do
with your life, hurt people?

367
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:19.457
You are better than this.

368
00:33:19.458 --> 00:33:20.792
I got a plan, mama.

369
00:33:21.752 --> 00:33:23.670
And I need you to believe in it.

370
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.172
I heard he's not so bad.

371
00:34:11.342 --> 00:34:12.344
Right on.

372
00:34:13.428 --> 00:34:14.471
And you are?

373
00:34:15.347 --> 00:34:18.724
- Paula.
<i>- Last call for flight 275 to Los Angeles.</i>

374
00:34:18.725 --> 00:34:21.227
That's me. Nice meeting you, George.

375
00:34:21.228 --> 00:34:23.230
Wait. Oh, that's not fair.

376
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:27.024
- You live here in Oakland?
- Yes, I do.

377
00:34:27.025 --> 00:34:29.026
So that means you'll be coming back.

378
00:34:29.027 --> 00:34:30.820
Yeah, I'm moving here.

379
00:34:30.821 --> 00:34:33.949
I'm gonna be training,
but when I'm not, you know,

380
00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:36.242
I could go outside sometimes.

381
00:34:36.243 --> 00:34:38.829
Your footwork is better
than your pickup game, George.

382
00:34:39.788 --> 00:34:41.580
Yeah, I can't argue that.

383
00:34:41.581 --> 00:34:44.877
Tell me something about yourself. Anything.

384
00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:47.670
- Anything?
- Yeah.

385
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.719
I can type a hundred words a minute.

386
00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.097
I can't even talk that fast.

387
00:35:04.271 --> 00:35:05.689
Can I see you again?

388
00:35:11.195 --> 00:35:13.238
Go ahead and write your phone number down.

389
00:35:15.699 --> 00:35:18.201
I'm the one 'posed to be asking for yours.

390
00:35:18.202 --> 00:35:21.330
George, do I look like the kind of woman
that stands around by the phone?

391
00:35:38.055 --> 00:35:40.515
No, ma'am. You do not.

392
00:35:40.516 --> 00:35:43.559
Well, hold on.
Are you sure we need these guys?

393
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.394
Pro game's a racket.

394
00:35:45.395 --> 00:35:47.356
These guys could take us
where we need to go.

395
00:35:52.569 --> 00:35:57.616
<i>I'm smelling me some new blood, new blood</i>

396
00:35:59.368 --> 00:36:01.536
hey. Dick sadler.

397
00:36:01.537 --> 00:36:03.664
He gonna be your trainer
and your promoter.

398
00:36:04.581 --> 00:36:05.998
This is Archie Moore,

399
00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:08.668
the former light-heavyweight champion
of the world.

400
00:36:08.669 --> 00:36:10.753
He gonna teach you everything
that he done learned.

401
00:36:10.754 --> 00:36:12.965
If I like what I see.

402
00:36:17.928 --> 00:36:19.513
Hey, Sonny. I'm such a big fan.

403
00:36:20.722 --> 00:36:21.890
Can I get your autograph?

404
00:36:23.183 --> 00:36:24.725
- Hey, that's...
- Yeah, it's...

405
00:36:24.726 --> 00:36:25.978
Sonny liston.

406
00:36:26.478 --> 00:36:28.647
We make champions around here, son.

407
00:36:29.439 --> 00:36:32.776
What you're setting out to do
is beyond your imagination.

408
00:36:34.778 --> 00:36:37.280
The morning you wake up
to fight for that championship,

409
00:36:37.281 --> 00:36:40.575
the air taste different,
the sun look different.

410
00:36:40.576 --> 00:36:44.245
Only two men on this whole earth matter
and you're one of them.

411
00:36:44.246 --> 00:36:47.623
The other, if you make it that far,

412
00:36:47.624 --> 00:36:49.084
is Joe Frazier.

413
00:37:08.145 --> 00:37:11.315
We gonna name this bag Joe Frazier.

414
00:37:12.482 --> 00:37:15.651
If you hit him in the solar plexus,
you gonna cut off his breathing.

415
00:37:15.652 --> 00:37:18.654
You hit him in the chin,
you gonna rattle his nerves.

416
00:37:18.655 --> 00:37:21.407
You hit him in the heart,
you gonna make his heartbeat skip.

417
00:37:21.408 --> 00:37:23.410
Every punch, George, power!

418
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.164
<i>- Hello?</i>
- First ring.

419
00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:29.707
- Paula!
- Yes.

420
00:37:29.708 --> 00:37:32.268
I wanna hear the rest of that story
you were starting to tell me.

421
00:37:32.794 --> 00:37:34.003
What story?

422
00:37:34.004 --> 00:37:37.007
About how you can type 100 words a minute.

423
00:37:39.718 --> 00:37:41.010
That story.

424
00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:45.223
George, when are you gonna
ask me a real question?

425
00:37:45.224 --> 00:37:46.350
Like what?

426
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.227
Like...

427
00:37:49.019 --> 00:37:50.687
If I wanna go out on a date.

428
00:37:53.649 --> 00:37:55.067
Pound him, George. Pound him!

429
00:38:03.784 --> 00:38:05.868
You sure you typing real words?

430
00:38:05.869 --> 00:38:07.871
Yeah, that sound like music.

431
00:38:24.137 --> 00:38:26.472
- Knock him out, baby!
- All right, all right.

432
00:38:26.473 --> 00:38:28.016
Keep him there. Keep him there.

433
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:30.309
Move him, man.

434
00:38:34.523 --> 00:38:36.358
- That's it!
- Yes!

435
00:38:41.864 --> 00:38:44.115
The winner by tko,

436
00:38:44.116 --> 00:38:47.911
still undefeated, George foreman!

437
00:38:50.914 --> 00:38:53.207
Do you take this woman to be your wife?

438
00:38:53.208 --> 00:38:54.293
You bet I do.

439
00:39:00.215 --> 00:39:01.592
You may kiss the bride.

440
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.059
Hey, watch this.

441
00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:28.368
- I think you ready.
- Nice punching, big fella.

442
00:39:30.662 --> 00:39:32.623
Frazier won't know what hit him.

443
00:39:33.874 --> 00:39:37.585
{\an8}<i>Here we are
for the heavyweight championship fight</i>

444
00:39:37.586 --> 00:39:41.423
{\an8}<i>between Joe Frazier and George foreman.</i>

445
00:39:42.758 --> 00:39:45.718
<i>Joe Frazier is the heavy favorite tonight.</i>

446
00:39:45.719 --> 00:39:49.555
His best weapon, the left hook, is deadly.

447
00:39:49.556 --> 00:39:52.892
Put Ali on the canvas two years ago,

448
00:39:52.893 --> 00:39:57.188
and if foreman isn't aware of it,
it could put him on his back,

449
00:39:57.189 --> 00:40:01.150
and maybe even carried
out of the arena on a stretcher.

450
00:40:01.151 --> 00:40:09.151
<i>Frazier! Frazier! Frazier!</i>

451
00:40:15.374 --> 00:40:18.459
This contest is for
the heavyweight championship of the world.

452
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.128
It's governed
by the Jamaican board of control...

453
00:40:21.129 --> 00:40:23.799
Nobody giving you a chance to win tonight.

454
00:40:25.717 --> 00:40:26.802
<i>That's good.</i>

455
00:40:30.889 --> 00:40:33.392
<i>But smokin' Joe ain't like
the others, nah.</i>

456
00:40:34.393 --> 00:40:36.061
He the real deal.

457
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.524
Remember, only two men
on this whole earth matter.

458
00:40:41.567 --> 00:40:42.693
Now go get him.

459
00:40:45.112 --> 00:40:46.363
<i>You're ready, George.</i>

460
00:40:47.739 --> 00:40:50.617
<i>Now, Joe,
he's expecting that you're just a man.</i>

461
00:40:51.785 --> 00:40:54.663
<i>But tonight, you're a beast.</i>

462
00:40:55.956 --> 00:40:57.165
Let him out.

463
00:40:59.126 --> 00:41:01.085
And there's the bell. They're underway.

464
00:41:01.086 --> 00:41:03.630
Oh, big swing and a miss from George.

465
00:41:07.176 --> 00:41:09.260
There's that Joe Frazier left hook.

466
00:41:09.261 --> 00:41:11.762
One more of those could end it.

467
00:41:11.763 --> 00:41:14.391
Stay on him. Watch out for that.
Watch out for that.

468
00:41:18.687 --> 00:41:20.272
Big shot by foreman.

469
00:41:25.277 --> 00:41:26.861
Oh, and another left hook!

470
00:41:26.862 --> 00:41:28.739
How is he still standing?

471
00:41:30.449 --> 00:41:31.700
There it is.

472
00:41:33.535 --> 00:41:36.788
Frazier's taking some damage.
A real surprise.

473
00:41:37.456 --> 00:41:38.707
That's it. That's it!

474
00:41:42.085 --> 00:41:45.421
Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!

475
00:41:45.422 --> 00:41:47.132
Down goes Frazier!

476
00:41:51.303 --> 00:41:52.763
Joe is slow to get up.

477
00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.642
And George foreman is standing
as poised as can be.

478
00:41:57.643 --> 00:42:01.230
The heavyweight champ
is taking the eight count.

479
00:42:02.898 --> 00:42:04.942
There's the bell for the second round.

480
00:42:06.735 --> 00:42:09.238
But Joe is tough. Joe is game.

481
00:42:10.489 --> 00:42:15.452
And foreman is all over him again,
just hitting him again and again.

482
00:42:20.332 --> 00:42:21.791
He's down again!

483
00:42:21.792 --> 00:42:23.460
This is hard to believe.

484
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.087
Get off the ropes!

485
00:42:26.088 --> 00:42:29.466
Six, seven, eight.

486
00:42:34.012 --> 00:42:36.597
He's target practice for George foreman.

487
00:42:36.598 --> 00:42:38.725
Target practice!

488
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:42.563
- Don't let up.
- How much more can Frazier take?

489
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:54.448
He's down! He's down again!

490
00:42:54.449 --> 00:42:55.867
And it's over!

491
00:42:55.868 --> 00:42:57.869
It's over! So long!

492
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:00.205
I've never seen anything like this.

493
00:43:01.415 --> 00:43:06.044
George foreman is the new
heavyweight champion of the world.

494
00:43:15.387 --> 00:43:18.265
All right.

495
00:43:19.099 --> 00:43:20.100
Yes.

496
00:43:37.659 --> 00:43:39.076
How does it feel to be a winner?

497
00:43:39.077 --> 00:43:41.329
I was determined
to become a winner tonight.

498
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.414
I'd like to thank the press
all over the country

499
00:43:43.415 --> 00:43:45.291
for writing beautiful things about me.

500
00:43:45.292 --> 00:43:48.295
The press has kept my name
in the paper. And...

501
00:43:49.171 --> 00:43:51.464
And it kept me focused.

502
00:43:51.465 --> 00:43:54.967
So, what's the first thing
you'll do as a champion, George?

503
00:43:54.968 --> 00:43:57.346
I'm gonna buy my mama a big house.

504
00:44:00.182 --> 00:44:03.142
Wait a second. Wait... what is this?

505
00:44:03.143 --> 00:44:06.146
Is that the champ? Is that the champ?

506
00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:10.275
Do you have any idea
what's coming next, George?

507
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:12.860
A flood of money.

508
00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:15.072
Well, I'm always ready for money.

509
00:44:15.906 --> 00:44:17.241
But my moneyman ain't.

510
00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:22.328
You want me to be your moneyman?

511
00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:23.747
Yeah, I do.

512
00:44:24.873 --> 00:44:26.124
But, des, man...

513
00:44:27.084 --> 00:44:30.003
I'm gonna need you sharp from now on.

514
00:44:38.262 --> 00:44:40.097
That's what I'm talking about.

515
00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.351
It's a long way from the job corps.

516
00:45:15.007 --> 00:45:16.592
How'd you get up here?

517
00:45:24.683 --> 00:45:26.310
You don't want me to stay?

518
00:46:06.099 --> 00:46:09.644
<i>Muhammad, there are a lot of people saying</i>

519
00:46:09.645 --> 00:46:12.396
<i>they've never seen as formidable a puncher</i>

520
00:46:12.397 --> 00:46:15.942
<i>as the new champ,
young George foreman.</i>

521
00:46:15.943 --> 00:46:17.735
<i>Howard, when I think of George foreman,</i>

522
00:46:17.736 --> 00:46:21.280
<i>I think of the establishment,
the flag-waver.</i>

523
00:46:21.281 --> 00:46:23.115
<i>And I got a new punch for George, Howard,</i>

524
00:46:23.116 --> 00:46:25.409
<i>and I call it the "ghetto whopper."</i>

525
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.578
<i>And the reason I call it
the ghetto whopper</i>

526
00:46:27.579 --> 00:46:31.667
<i>is because it's thrown in the ghetto
at 3 o'clock in the morning.</i>

527
00:46:32.334 --> 00:46:33.793
<i>You ever seen one of them punches?</i>

528
00:46:33.794 --> 00:46:36.045
<i>Comes out of nowhere,
hits you like a bottle in the head.</i>

529
00:46:36.046 --> 00:46:38.965
<i>Think you'd have to wait
till 3:00 in the morning</i>

530
00:46:38.966 --> 00:46:40.508
<i>to fight George foreman?</i>

531
00:46:40.509 --> 00:46:42.093
<i>Howard, let it be known.</i>

532
00:46:42.094 --> 00:46:45.514
<i>I will fight George foreman
anywhere, any time.</i>

533
00:46:49.184 --> 00:46:51.936
- What y'all think? Nice, isn't it?
- Oh, my lord.

534
00:46:51.937 --> 00:46:54.898
Now, come on.
I wanna show y'all something.

535
00:46:56.316 --> 00:46:57.317
Y'all hear that?

536
00:46:58.068 --> 00:47:00.529
Now, each car has its own personality.

537
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.781
That's why you need five of them?

538
00:47:03.532 --> 00:47:06.618
Five? Wait till you see my garage.

539
00:47:07.202 --> 00:47:09.704
Oh, my lord.
You've lost your doggone mind.

540
00:47:09.705 --> 00:47:11.373
I wanna show y'all something else.

541
00:47:11.957 --> 00:47:14.167
- All right. You got that other one there?
- Yes, sir.

542
00:47:14.168 --> 00:47:15.168
Okay.

543
00:47:16.295 --> 00:47:17.837
Been on a grill all day for y'all.

544
00:47:17.838 --> 00:47:21.299
My own barbecue sauce.
I took my time on it.

545
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.052
- Okay. That's what I'm talking about.
- Working on this all day.

546
00:47:24.761 --> 00:47:26.387
- Okay
- that looks fantastic.

547
00:47:26.388 --> 00:47:27.848
There she is.

548
00:47:28.932 --> 00:47:31.351
- Give me my birthday baby.
- Your daddy wants you.

549
00:47:32.728 --> 00:47:33.896
- Yeah.
- Go to daddy.

550
00:47:35.272 --> 00:47:36.273
Yeah.

551
00:47:37.649 --> 00:47:40.277
- Happy birthday.
- How about one for your wife too?

552
00:47:43.655 --> 00:47:46.449
All right. Say hi to everybody.

553
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:47.950
Say hi to everybody.

554
00:47:47.951 --> 00:47:50.328
- Happy birthday, beautiful.
- I'm gonna give you away.

555
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:51.729
- Don't give her away.
- I love you.

556
00:47:53.999 --> 00:47:55.417
- All right.
- Bye.

557
00:47:56.627 --> 00:47:58.669
- It's time to eat now.
- Boy.

558
00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:01.923
- You know better.
- Let's thank god for the food first.

559
00:48:01.924 --> 00:48:03.008
God?

560
00:48:04.051 --> 00:48:05.801
I bought the food, mama.

561
00:48:05.802 --> 00:48:08.180
- Not god.
- Good.

562
00:48:08.805 --> 00:48:10.057
Then you say grace.

563
00:48:13.185 --> 00:48:14.770
I like the way you say it, mama.

564
00:48:16.688 --> 00:48:19.233
Me and Charles have something
we wanna tell y'all.

565
00:48:21.485 --> 00:48:23.529
- We're having a baby.
- A baby?

566
00:48:24.196 --> 00:48:27.031
Charles, you old dog.
Getting my sister pregnant.

567
00:48:27.032 --> 00:48:29.742
- Look at that.
- Mary, congratulations.

568
00:48:29.743 --> 00:48:31.453
- Thank you.
- It's great.

569
00:48:33.455 --> 00:48:35.736
We'll have me another niece
or nephew running around here.

570
00:48:38.794 --> 00:48:39.794
Hello?

571
00:48:43.507 --> 00:48:45.217
Stop calling this house.

572
00:48:49.388 --> 00:48:51.556
- So, des...
- Yes, sir.

573
00:48:51.557 --> 00:48:52.974
How's my money doing?

574
00:48:52.975 --> 00:48:57.228
I'm pouring everything
into rock-solid stocks.

575
00:48:57.229 --> 00:48:58.896
I like the sound of that.

576
00:48:58.897 --> 00:49:00.732
"Rock-solid stocks."

577
00:49:03.402 --> 00:49:06.988
You know, Ali sure been talking
a whole bunch of mess on TV,

578
00:49:06.989 --> 00:49:09.157
bragging about which round
he'll knock you out in.

579
00:49:11.743 --> 00:49:13.202
Talk is cheap.

580
00:49:13.203 --> 00:49:16.622
You know what they say about pretty boys
back in the fifth wards.

581
00:49:16.623 --> 00:49:18.332
They can't take a punch.

582
00:49:18.333 --> 00:49:19.418
Yes.

583
00:49:31.513 --> 00:49:33.764
I think everybody's ready for dessert.

584
00:49:33.765 --> 00:49:35.266
You should tell me their names,

585
00:49:35.267 --> 00:49:38.270
so I don't have to stand there
holding the phone like a fool.

586
00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:40.563
What are you talking about?

587
00:49:40.564 --> 00:49:42.024
Did you think I didn't know?

588
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:47.487
- I don't have time for this.
- No, it's me you don't have time for.

589
00:49:52.743 --> 00:49:57.122
How many have there been, George?

590
00:50:01.627 --> 00:50:03.836
You can't even look me in the eye anymore.

591
00:50:03.837 --> 00:50:07.215
Woman, I got a $5 million fight
coming up against Ali.

592
00:50:07.216 --> 00:50:10.594
You think I dropped my life for you,
so that I could play seconds?

593
00:50:12.179 --> 00:50:14.180
I was doing just fine
before you came along.

594
00:50:14.181 --> 00:50:16.475
So you don't like this life now, huh?

595
00:50:17.559 --> 00:50:18.893
I give you everything.

596
00:50:18.894 --> 00:50:20.687
I don't want everything.

597
00:50:26.401 --> 00:50:27.569
I want you.

598
00:50:29.404 --> 00:50:30.489
You have me.

599
00:50:33.408 --> 00:50:34.493
Look at me.

600
00:50:45.629 --> 00:50:46.797
Look at me.

601
00:50:59.434 --> 00:51:00.727
Just like I thought.

602
00:51:43.812 --> 00:51:45.230
Sir. No, no.

603
00:51:45.814 --> 00:51:46.940
- I got it.
- Okay.

604
00:51:56.366 --> 00:51:57.450
Come on, now.

605
00:51:57.451 --> 00:51:59.911
We gonna float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

606
00:51:59.912 --> 00:52:02.705
His hands can't hit
what his eyes can't see.

607
00:52:02.706 --> 00:52:04.290
Now you see me. Now you don't.

608
00:52:04.291 --> 00:52:06.502
George thinks he will,
but I know he won't.

609
00:52:07.377 --> 00:52:08.920
Ain't that right, bundini?

610
00:52:08.921 --> 00:52:12.173
Him hitting Joe Frazier
with these big, long punches.

611
00:52:12.174 --> 00:52:13.842
Boxes like a mummy.

612
00:52:14.927 --> 00:52:18.680
"Come here. Where'd you get?
Oh, you over here."

613
00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:22.058
All of you sportswriters,
all of you suckers,

614
00:52:22.059 --> 00:52:24.519
are gonna regret
making me the underdog.

615
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.103
How you gonna make me the underdog?

616
00:52:26.104 --> 00:52:28.481
Talking about George foreman
is the new champ.

617
00:52:28.482 --> 00:52:31.693
George foreman ain't no new champ.
He is the new chump.

618
00:52:32.486 --> 00:52:35.404
And he's holding the belt
that was wrongfully taken from me.

619
00:52:35.405 --> 00:52:37.698
And he can't box. He moves like this.

620
00:52:37.699 --> 00:52:39.785
This how he box. Box like a mummy.

621
00:52:40.702 --> 00:52:42.371
"Coming here for you. I'm..."

622
00:52:44.998 --> 00:52:45.999
George.

623
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:48.919
We was just talking
about a different fighter.

624
00:52:52.673 --> 00:52:54.632
Your turn, big George.

625
00:52:54.633 --> 00:52:56.677
Why don't you give us
your side of things, huh?

626
00:53:19.032 --> 00:53:23.161
Well, if he boxes how he does interviews,
this gonna be a short night.

627
00:53:24.162 --> 00:53:25.538
Real short night.

628
00:53:25.539 --> 00:53:28.625
We gonna get it on
because we don't get along.

629
00:53:29.418 --> 00:53:31.295
I feel sorry for Ali.

630
00:53:32.087 --> 00:53:33.797
Foreman could put him in the morgue.

631
00:53:48.979 --> 00:53:50.314
"Ali, kill him."

632
00:53:51.607 --> 00:53:53.192
That's what they want?

633
00:53:59.489 --> 00:54:00.490
Foreman...

634
00:54:23.305 --> 00:54:24.680
Rush him like a tiger.

635
00:54:24.681 --> 00:54:26.057
Shut him up for good.

636
00:54:26.058 --> 00:54:28.559
Ali has shocked the world before,

637
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.563
but most of us don't expect him
to get past the middle rounds.

638
00:54:32.564 --> 00:54:35.983
Well, frank,
Ali is certainly the big underdog.

639
00:54:35.984 --> 00:54:40.112
But he and the country have adopted
the phrase, "Ali, <i>bomaye."</i>

640
00:54:40.113 --> 00:54:41.322
"Ali, kill him."

641
00:54:41.323 --> 00:54:42.823
At 32 years of age,

642
00:54:42.824 --> 00:54:45.826
can Muhammad Ali dance
and stay away from foreman?

643
00:54:45.827 --> 00:54:47.995
After what foreman did to Frazier,

644
00:54:47.996 --> 00:54:50.958
Ali would seem to have no chance.

645
00:54:52.459 --> 00:54:54.544
All questions will be answered.

646
00:54:54.545 --> 00:54:57.088
Come on, baby. Come on, George.

647
00:54:57.089 --> 00:54:58.882
- You got this, George.
- Dance with him.

648
00:55:02.511 --> 00:55:04.929
- Get in there.
- Rush him, George. Rush him.

649
00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:06.515
- Right hook.
- Rush him.

650
00:55:09.852 --> 00:55:10.978
There you go.

651
00:55:11.645 --> 00:55:12.979
Punch him in the head.

652
00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.648
Let him go. Break. Break.

653
00:55:17.484 --> 00:55:19.027
Come on, George. Come on.

654
00:55:20.487 --> 00:55:21.905
Hands up. Yeah!

655
00:55:27.536 --> 00:55:29.663
That's all you got, George? Come on.

656
00:55:35.878 --> 00:55:37.003
Keep pounding.

657
00:55:37.004 --> 00:55:38.255
He can't last.

658
00:55:39.298 --> 00:55:40.424
Keep on pounding.

659
00:55:46.972 --> 00:55:48.390
That's right, champ.

660
00:55:51.602 --> 00:55:53.644
Ali retreating to the ropes,

661
00:55:53.645 --> 00:55:56.105
looking for a place to hide
from foreman's power.

662
00:55:56.106 --> 00:55:57.065
That's all you got?

663
00:55:57.066 --> 00:56:00.152
I don't see any place to hide
in that ring.

664
00:56:00.903 --> 00:56:02.738
Ali, get off of those ropes!

665
00:56:04.031 --> 00:56:05.824
Foreman's pouring on the punches.

666
00:56:07.034 --> 00:56:09.243
Those punches gotta be doing some damage.

667
00:56:09.244 --> 00:56:11.662
They told me you was bad, George.
Let me see it.

668
00:56:11.663 --> 00:56:15.209
Ali cannot keep taking them
and expect to survive.

669
00:56:15.667 --> 00:56:16.835
Box.

670
00:56:22.007 --> 00:56:23.299
Come on. Show me something.

671
00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:24.760
Don't play with that sucker.

672
00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:28.639
Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

673
00:56:29.973 --> 00:56:31.600
Stay on him, George!

674
00:56:32.601 --> 00:56:34.978
Come on, champ, get off the ropes.
Come on, now.

675
00:56:36.063 --> 00:56:37.189
There it is.

676
00:56:39.775 --> 00:56:40.901
Break it up, ref.

677
00:56:41.652 --> 00:56:44.154
- What's my name?
- There we go. Break it up.

678
00:56:49.618 --> 00:56:52.371
Get off those ropes! Get out of there!

679
00:56:53.288 --> 00:56:55.873
I'm not sure about this strategy
of retreating to the ropes.

680
00:56:55.874 --> 00:56:58.668
I'm going right back to the ropes.
Come and get me.

681
00:56:58.669 --> 00:57:00.878
Come on. Put that pressure on him, George.

682
00:57:00.879 --> 00:57:01.921
He's getting pounded.

683
00:57:01.922 --> 00:57:04.967
Those blows are deadly
from George foreman.

684
00:57:10.389 --> 00:57:12.641
Come on, George. Let me see something.

685
00:57:18.146 --> 00:57:19.857
Get off of those ropes!

686
00:57:23.026 --> 00:57:25.904
Come on, George.
They told me you could hit hard.

687
00:57:26.446 --> 00:57:27.489
There you go.

688
00:57:37.875 --> 00:57:39.126
That's all you got?

689
00:57:45.674 --> 00:57:49.385
Big right hand from Ali.
That punch staggered foreman.

690
00:57:49.386 --> 00:57:51.137
They told me you was bad, George.

691
00:57:51.138 --> 00:57:52.847
They told me you was bad.

692
00:57:52.848 --> 00:57:56.935
That one punch definitely changed
the tenor of this fight.

693
00:58:04.193 --> 00:58:07.529
Keep hitting him. Keep pounding him.

694
00:58:22.711 --> 00:58:24.004
I'm gonna end it.

695
00:58:27.758 --> 00:58:28.800
I'm gonna end it.

696
00:58:35.682 --> 00:58:37.643
Get off those ropes, champ. Come on.

697
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.561
That's right.

698
00:59:09.132 --> 00:59:11.425
Foreman's punches just don't have
any juice on them.

699
00:59:11.426 --> 00:59:13.386
Foreman looks tired.

700
00:59:13.387 --> 00:59:14.679
He could be in real trouble.

701
00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:17.808
Maybe this is
what Ali was counting on, frank.

702
00:59:20.394 --> 00:59:22.437
- Work on him, George!
- Destroy him!

703
00:59:34.241 --> 00:59:35.408
My turn.

704
00:59:35.409 --> 00:59:37.744
Come on. That's right.
Left, right, left. Come on.

705
00:59:38.745 --> 00:59:42.499
Oh, Muhammad Ali
with a massive right hand!

706
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.003
And another one!

707
01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:08.774
Four, five, six, seven,

708
01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:11.819
eight, nine, ten.

709
01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.405
And it's over. It's over!

710
01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:16.699
Ali has done the impossible.

711
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.620
Ali did it! Ali did it again.

712
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:31.381
<i>I lived one way my whole life.</i>

713
01:00:33.926 --> 01:00:34.927
<i>To hurt...</i>

714
01:00:36.303 --> 01:00:37.596
<i>To knock down...</i>

715
01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:39.973
<i>To destroy.</i>

716
01:00:53.278 --> 01:00:55.447
<i>It became all I could see.</i>

717
01:00:58.617 --> 01:01:00.702
<i>I was blind to everything else.</i>

718
01:01:03.622 --> 01:01:05.707
<i>When will I get to see you, daddy?</i>

719
01:01:07.584 --> 01:01:08.584
Soon.

720
01:01:10.629 --> 01:01:11.630
I promise.

721
01:01:13.799 --> 01:01:17.177
And we will never be apart again. Okay?

722
01:01:19.054 --> 01:01:21.223
<i>George, we gotta go now. It's dinnertime.</i>

723
01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:24.350
<i>My lawyer said
you haven't signed the papers.</i>

724
01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:26.102
I told you I'd get to it.

725
01:01:26.103 --> 01:01:27.521
<i>Get to it soon.</i>

726
01:01:58.552 --> 01:01:59.970
I wanted to come sooner.

727
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:03.974
Why you sitting out in the car?
Why don't you come on inside?

728
01:02:07.561 --> 01:02:09.438
Doc said you fired dick and Archie.

729
01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:12.064
Yeah.

730
01:02:12.774 --> 01:02:14.610
I lost a fight because of them.

731
01:02:17.196 --> 01:02:18.864
It's like doc always said...

732
01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:22.951
I should've used my head
instead of my hands.

733
01:02:27.247 --> 01:02:28.665
He laid on the ropes...

734
01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:31.710
And I kept punching till I was tired.

735
01:02:34.463 --> 01:02:35.881
The rope-a-dope.

736
01:02:39.635 --> 01:02:40.928
And I was the dope.

737
01:02:42.387 --> 01:02:44.680
Look, I know you done had a hard time,

738
01:02:44.681 --> 01:02:47.643
but I can't stand
to hear you talking like this.

739
01:02:49.478 --> 01:02:52.271
<i>Foreman has been a dispirited,
lonely man</i>

740
01:02:52.272 --> 01:02:54.607
<i>through all of these six months
that have passed</i>

741
01:02:54.608 --> 01:02:57.401
<i>since Ali knocked him out
in the eighth round.</i>

742
01:02:57.402 --> 01:03:01.239
<i>Today, a boxing exhibition of sorts.</i>

743
01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.909
George foreman,
former heavyweight champion of the world,

744
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:08.372
will attempt to knock out
five fighters in one day.

745
01:03:09.456 --> 01:03:14.086
Exactly what he hopes to accomplish
by this is anybody's guess.

746
01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:18.006
George, you still got time to back out.

747
01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:19.675
You ain't gotta do this.

748
01:03:21.844 --> 01:03:25.263
Heavyweight champion
and world-class clown, Muhammad Ali,

749
01:03:25.264 --> 01:03:26.722
about to join me at the table.

750
01:03:26.723 --> 01:03:29.226
"Clown"? Howard, don't get hurt, now.

751
01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.396
There's the bell. And they're underway.

752
01:03:33.105 --> 01:03:34.939
Not his usual style, Muhammad.

753
01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.858
Yeah, I think he's trying to impress me.

754
01:03:36.859 --> 01:03:40.570
He's... he's bouncing around
like the easter bunny.

755
01:03:40.571 --> 01:03:42.948
Indeed, like a bunny, Muhammad.

756
01:03:44.408 --> 01:03:45.908
What are you doing?

757
01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:47.743
Get on them ropes. There you go.

758
01:03:47.744 --> 01:03:49.538
Stay on the ropes. Get on the ropes.

759
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.706
Ain't no wrestling match, George.

760
01:03:51.707 --> 01:03:53.792
Get on the ropes now. Make him work.

761
01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:58.838
Now Johnson is on the canvas.

762
01:03:58.839 --> 01:04:01.174
- Think that might be it for Alonzo.
- Can't you see he's down?

763
01:04:01.175 --> 01:04:03.259
- Seems to be a scuffle.
- Back off.

764
01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.011
Oh, there's a fight breaking out

765
01:04:05.012 --> 01:04:08.097
- between foreman's trainers and Johnson's.
- Step back!

766
01:04:08.098 --> 01:04:14.979
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

767
01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:18.399
Crowd is chanting, "Ali! Ali!"

768
01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.402
Much to the consternation
of George foreman.

769
01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:22.779
Ali!

770
01:04:23.488 --> 01:04:24.655
Give me another shot.

771
01:04:24.656 --> 01:04:27.825
I'm not getting back in the ring
with no chump, George.

772
01:04:27.826 --> 01:04:29.827
That's 'cause you're scared of me.

773
01:04:29.828 --> 01:04:31.829
- Scared?
- You scared of me.

774
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.957
Well, let's go right now, George.

775
01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:37.710
- Hold my jacket, Howard. Hold my jacket.
- Come on in the ring.

776
01:04:37.711 --> 01:04:41.547
- Let me go. Hold my jacket.
- Can't fight. You ain't no fighter.

777
01:04:41.548 --> 01:04:43.299
Man can't fight laying on no ropes.

778
01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.635
George, I'm too pretty
to fight someone as ugly as you.

779
01:04:45.636 --> 01:04:46.928
Come on in here.

780
01:04:46.929 --> 01:04:50.181
Go ahead, man. Go ahead, George.

781
01:04:50.182 --> 01:04:52.642
- That's what I thought. Always talk.
- I'm telling you.

782
01:04:52.643 --> 01:04:58.941
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

783
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.086
What did you think
you were gonna gain out there?

784
01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:20.754
Respect.

785
01:05:21.505 --> 01:05:24.007
Son, the beauty of boxing

786
01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:28.887
is that it shows a man
that can he do something all by himself.

787
01:05:30.389 --> 01:05:31.807
Something constructive.

788
01:05:36.228 --> 01:05:41.233
Let's go back to fighting them
one at a time. What you say?

789
01:05:47.364 --> 01:05:48.532
This just came through.

790
01:05:51.118 --> 01:05:52.118
Okay.

791
01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:54.037
It's for you.

792
01:06:06.717 --> 01:06:08.135
George. George.

793
01:06:09.845 --> 01:06:11.846
- What happened?
- Mary started bleeding.

794
01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:15.266
They're trying to save the baby,
but the air got cut off.

795
01:06:15.267 --> 01:06:17.810
Tell them, whatever it cost,
I'll pay for it.

796
01:06:17.811 --> 01:06:19.103
We need the best doctors.

797
01:06:19.104 --> 01:06:21.564
We already got the best doctors, George.

798
01:06:21.565 --> 01:06:24.484
The baby needs a miracle. We need to pray.

799
01:06:26.862 --> 01:06:27.862
Pray?

800
01:06:35.662 --> 01:06:38.664
Heavenly father,
we are gathered here humbly,

801
01:06:38.665 --> 01:06:41.043
in the name of your son, Christ Jesus.

802
01:07:11.448 --> 01:07:13.825
All right, here I am.

803
01:07:18.622 --> 01:07:20.707
What did my sister ever do to you?

804
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:25.754
Mary's been sweet and kind
her whole life...

805
01:07:27.297 --> 01:07:28.966
To everybody in this world.

806
01:07:30.384 --> 01:07:31.384
To me,

807
01:07:32.052 --> 01:07:33.554
when I didn't deserve it.

808
01:07:35.222 --> 01:07:37.474
And you gonna take her baby?

809
01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:39.560
Answer me.

810
01:07:40.894 --> 01:07:43.063
Man, all my life
I've been hearing about you.

811
01:07:44.231 --> 01:07:46.441
And you ain't never shown me nothing.

812
01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:49.945
I ain't seen anything.

813
01:07:57.369 --> 01:07:59.204
If you wanna take somebody...

814
01:08:00.956 --> 01:08:01.957
You take me.

815
01:08:05.085 --> 01:08:07.296
You don't take my sister's baby, man.

816
01:08:10.591 --> 01:08:11.592
You take me.

817
01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:14.635
Please.

818
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:20.850
George.

819
01:08:38.076 --> 01:08:40.746
- Is he...?
- He's perfect.

820
01:08:42.622 --> 01:08:44.666
The doctors can't explain it.

821
01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:46.542
It's a miracle.

822
01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:49.171
That's...

823
01:08:51.298 --> 01:08:53.466
It's good. That's good.

824
01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.346
Well, come on over.

825
01:08:59.932 --> 01:09:01.808
Say hi to your nephew.

826
01:09:04.019 --> 01:09:05.229
Little George.

827
01:09:06.647 --> 01:09:07.773
Little George?

828
01:09:08.482 --> 01:09:09.482
Yeah.

829
01:09:13.487 --> 01:09:14.947
Mama told me you prayed.

830
01:09:18.242 --> 01:09:20.202
Whatever you said to him...

831
01:09:22.078 --> 01:09:23.205
It worked.

832
01:09:41.598 --> 01:09:43.516
<i>Jimmy young! Jimmy young!</i>

833
01:09:43.517 --> 01:09:48.187
{\an8}Listen to the crowd.
"Jimmy young. Jimmy young."

834
01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:51.648
{\an8}Foreman hasn't been the same
since he lost to Ali.

835
01:09:51.649 --> 01:09:54.277
- He fired his old team...
- Come on, George.

836
01:09:54.278 --> 01:09:55.571
But it hasn't worked.

837
01:09:57.656 --> 01:10:00.534
George's mind is just not in this fight.

838
01:10:18.969 --> 01:10:20.179
Let's go. All right.

839
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.855
Jimmy young has won the fight
by unanimous decision.

840
01:10:30.856 --> 01:10:32.566
Promising future for Jimmy...

841
01:10:46.538 --> 01:10:47.956
Keep an eye on him, all right?

842
01:10:51.335 --> 01:10:52.961
What happened out there, George?

843
01:10:53.545 --> 01:10:54.921
Come on, Gil. It's just a fight.

844
01:10:54.922 --> 01:10:56.255
Every boxer has a bad one.

845
01:10:56.256 --> 01:10:58.508
He couldn't afford one.
It was our shot back to Ali.

846
01:10:58.509 --> 01:10:59.843
Man, it's hot.

847
01:11:00.969 --> 01:11:02.429
Why's it so hot in here?

848
01:11:08.894 --> 01:11:09.895
Who said that?

849
01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:12.564
Nobody said nothing, George.

850
01:11:16.235 --> 01:11:17.319
Who said that?

851
01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:23.074
- Who keeps talking?
- Nobody.

852
01:11:23.075 --> 01:11:24.909
Nobody's talking, George.

853
01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:26.286
George?

854
01:11:31.834 --> 01:11:32.960
I'm...

855
01:11:35.754 --> 01:11:37.004
I'm fixing...

856
01:11:37.005 --> 01:11:38.507
Whoa, George. George!

857
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:42.510
He's got a faint pulse.
We need to get him up on the table.

858
01:11:42.511 --> 01:11:43.428
On three.

859
01:11:43.429 --> 01:11:45.848
- One, two, three.
- Careful.

860
01:11:47.099 --> 01:11:50.519
- Easy.
- There you go. On the table. Here we go.

861
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:53.229
All right.

862
01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:54.898
- George?
- George?

863
01:11:55.482 --> 01:11:56.483
George.

864
01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:08.161
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

865
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.206
<i>I believe.</i>

866
01:12:14.042 --> 01:12:15.252
<i>I believe.</i>

867
01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:21.341
- Hey.
- Whoa, easy.

868
01:12:23.218 --> 01:12:24.386
George?

869
01:12:27.639 --> 01:12:29.183
We thought you was dead.

870
01:12:31.393 --> 01:12:32.394
I was.

871
01:12:38.108 --> 01:12:40.152
Jesus Christ is alive in me.

872
01:12:42.487 --> 01:12:43.697
He's alive in me.

873
01:12:44.323 --> 01:12:45.324
He's alive.

874
01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:47.074
I gotta get myself clean.

875
01:12:47.075 --> 01:12:49.327
Don't let him get in the shower.
Cold water will be a shock.

876
01:12:49.328 --> 01:12:51.621
- Wait!
- I gotta get myself clean.

877
01:12:51.622 --> 01:12:52.872
- Wait. No, George.
- Get off.

878
01:12:52.873 --> 01:12:55.541
I gotta get myself clean! Please, please.

879
01:12:55.542 --> 01:12:57.169
Hallelujah!

880
01:12:59.129 --> 01:13:00.422
Hallelujah!

881
01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:03.717
I'm clean.

882
01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:06.512
I'm clean.

883
01:13:09.556 --> 01:13:12.391
I'm clean. I'm clean.

884
01:13:12.392 --> 01:13:14.393
<i>I now baptize you</i>

885
01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:17.230
in the name of the father,

886
01:13:17.231 --> 01:13:19.233
the son and the holy spirit.

887
01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:21.193
Hallelujah!

888
01:13:22.611 --> 01:13:24.071
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

889
01:13:34.623 --> 01:13:35.916
Hallelujah!

890
01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:42.797
<i>We are bearing witness to a miracle.</i>

891
01:13:42.798 --> 01:13:44.132
{\an8}And brother George...

892
01:13:44.842 --> 01:13:48.553
{\an8}Would like to share his version
of that miracle with you.

893
01:13:48.554 --> 01:13:50.471
So let's give a proper welcome

894
01:13:50.472 --> 01:13:53.391
to the former heavyweight champion
of the world

895
01:13:53.392 --> 01:13:56.603
and our new brother in Christ,
George foreman!

896
01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:13.620
Thank you, reverend Stokes.

897
01:14:16.874 --> 01:14:17.874
I...

898
01:14:18.876 --> 01:14:19.960
Was in a fight.

899
01:14:23.755 --> 01:14:25.424
I used to love fighting.

900
01:14:38.645 --> 01:14:40.272
I was in the dressing room, and...

901
01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:44.693
And Jesus Christ came alive in me.

902
01:14:48.113 --> 01:14:49.113
And...

903
01:14:50.115 --> 01:14:51.325
And because of it...

904
01:14:52.534 --> 01:14:54.411
I wanna give my life to god.

905
01:14:58.498 --> 01:14:59.498
All right.

906
01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:01.502
I wanna be a preacher.

907
01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:08.634
Thank you, Jesus.

908
01:15:09.468 --> 01:15:11.303
- Praise god!
- All right.

909
01:15:12.179 --> 01:15:15.598
He may have finally found somebody
who can tell him what to do.

910
01:15:15.599 --> 01:15:17.266
Praise Jesus!

911
01:15:17.267 --> 01:15:19.519
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

912
01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.978
- Yeah.
- Praise Jesus.

913
01:15:20.979 --> 01:15:22.189
Praise Jesus.

914
01:15:29.613 --> 01:15:31.615
You put on quite a show in there.

915
01:15:32.574 --> 01:15:34.368
I'm glad you was here to see it.

916
01:15:35.202 --> 01:15:38.789
So Gil's been setting the traps.
We still got us a path to Ali.

917
01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:40.749
I'm done.

918
01:15:41.792 --> 01:15:43.335
I'm not gonna box anymore.

919
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:47.923
- You a fighter.
- I'm not a fighter.

920
01:15:49.716 --> 01:15:50.801
Not anymore.

921
01:15:53.387 --> 01:15:55.222
So how are you gonna take care
of your kids?

922
01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:57.891
I'm gonna follow god.

923
01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:02.020
Do you know
what you're walking away from, son?

924
01:16:02.604 --> 01:16:03.855
You know, I...

925
01:16:03.856 --> 01:16:06.191
I can't even make a fist anymore, doc.

926
01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:09.736
It's like he reached inside of me...

927
01:16:10.821 --> 01:16:12.948
Just took out all my anger.

928
01:16:14.157 --> 01:16:15.701
That anger inside of you...

929
01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:17.786
It made you king.

930
01:16:18.745 --> 01:16:19.746
I saw it.

931
01:16:20.455 --> 01:16:22.874
Now you wanna tell me that it's all gone?

932
01:16:22.875 --> 01:16:27.337
Remember when you told me that
you traded in one uniform for another?

933
01:16:30.257 --> 01:16:31.592
That's what I'm doing.

934
01:16:33.594 --> 01:16:36.512
You can understand that, can't you?

935
01:16:36.513 --> 01:16:38.765
I had no say, George.

936
01:16:40.017 --> 01:16:41.727
My choice was made for me.

937
01:16:44.021 --> 01:16:45.272
So was mine.

938
01:16:49.776 --> 01:16:51.445
I don't believe you, George.

939
01:17:02.456 --> 01:17:06.460
<i>For 28 years,
I used my fists to get respect.</i>

940
01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:10.589
<i>I knew I had to start using my heart.</i>

941
01:17:13.383 --> 01:17:14.760
<i>I just didn't know how.</i>

942
01:17:16.553 --> 01:17:19.264
<i>She told me
big George foreman was at the door.</i>

943
01:17:20.015 --> 01:17:22.725
And I said, "Beatrice, you are crazy.

944
01:17:22.726 --> 01:17:24.894
George foreman ain't coming
to see the champ

945
01:17:24.895 --> 01:17:27.314
unless he's looking for another whupping."

946
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:42.079
So I've come here...

947
01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:46.791
To tell you that I found Jesus.

948
01:17:46.792 --> 01:17:47.918
You found Jesus?

949
01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:51.713
Congratulations, George.
I did not know he was lost.

950
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.801
I came here...

951
01:17:57.761 --> 01:17:59.595
To ask for your forgiveness.

952
01:17:59.596 --> 01:18:01.722
- For my forgiveness?
- Yes.

953
01:18:01.723 --> 01:18:03.724
I'm the one who knocked you out.

954
01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:04.893
You know...

955
01:18:06.687 --> 01:18:07.980
After Zaire...

956
01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.234
I hated you, Muhammad.

957
01:18:13.527 --> 01:18:14.528
I did.

958
01:18:15.654 --> 01:18:17.281
And I wanted to kill you...

959
01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:19.532
With these hands.

960
01:18:19.533 --> 01:18:23.077
Come on, man.
You want a rematch. I know.

961
01:18:23.078 --> 01:18:24.329
Just come out and say it.

962
01:18:25.038 --> 01:18:26.498
I don't want no rematch.

963
01:18:26.999 --> 01:18:29.750
They told me you retired to preach,
but I didn't believe it.

964
01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:30.751
Well, I...

965
01:18:31.503 --> 01:18:32.920
I wanna help people.

966
01:18:32.921 --> 01:18:34.672
Well, George, help me, okay?

967
01:18:34.673 --> 01:18:37.758
All you got to do is fight Kenny Norton
one more time. Knock him out.

968
01:18:37.759 --> 01:18:40.595
Please, George, knock him out.
Because I sure can't.

969
01:18:40.596 --> 01:18:43.055
You knock him out,
he won't be a top-ranked contender.

970
01:18:43.056 --> 01:18:44.682
I'll give you another shot at the title.

971
01:18:44.683 --> 01:18:47.561
And then we'll both get paid, huh?
Praise Jesus.

972
01:18:52.691 --> 01:18:55.777
I can't help you that way.

973
01:19:01.742 --> 01:19:02.868
All right, brother.

974
01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:05.161
Fine.

975
01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:08.248
I forgive you.

976
01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:13.002
George foreman, a preacher.

977
01:19:13.003 --> 01:19:15.047
Now I have seen it all.

978
01:19:23.972 --> 01:19:25.057
Hi!

979
01:19:27.267 --> 01:19:29.686
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, michi.

980
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:33.190
- I love you.
- Michi, take your brother inside.

981
01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:35.192
Go inside, George.

982
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:40.948
What are you doing here?

983
01:19:46.995 --> 01:19:48.080
I came here...

984
01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:53.669
To tell you how sorry I am
for the way that I treated you.

985
01:19:56.797 --> 01:19:58.048
It wasn't right.

986
01:20:02.594 --> 01:20:06.597
"Let love be without dissimulation.

987
01:20:06.598 --> 01:20:08.892
Cleave to that which is good."

988
01:20:23.156 --> 01:20:24.156
Hi.

989
01:20:27.494 --> 01:20:28.495
I'm George.

990
01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.831
Mary Joan martelly.

991
01:20:31.832 --> 01:20:35.627
You were sitting in that same seat
the day I gave my testimony.

992
01:20:41.008 --> 01:20:42.593
You always sat up front?

993
01:20:43.427 --> 01:20:46.388
Yes. Helps me stay focused on god.

994
01:20:53.812 --> 01:20:55.647
How's being a preacher going for you?

995
01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:57.691
It's hard.

996
01:20:58.734 --> 01:20:59.734
Real hard.

997
01:21:00.068 --> 01:21:02.821
Harder than getting punched in the face?

998
01:21:06.533 --> 01:21:09.411
Sometimes it feels about the same.

999
01:21:10.996 --> 01:21:13.540
Blessed is the man who remains steadfast.

1000
01:21:21.298 --> 01:21:24.343
Brothers and sisters, I am out here today,

1001
01:21:24.968 --> 01:21:26.761
not to lift myself up,

1002
01:21:26.762 --> 01:21:29.348
but to lift up the name of Jesus Christ.

1003
01:21:29.973 --> 01:21:33.351
See, I was a man
who rejected all religion.

1004
01:21:33.352 --> 01:21:35.144
"Jesus" was a cussword to me,

1005
01:21:35.145 --> 01:21:37.605
but the lord changed my life.

1006
01:21:37.606 --> 01:21:39.398
Wasn't the lord who changed you.

1007
01:21:39.399 --> 01:21:42.777
It was Jimmy young.
I seen him beat the hell out of you.

1008
01:21:42.778 --> 01:21:44.488
Did you at least pinch him?

1009
01:21:46.615 --> 01:21:49.618
Don't you miss being in that ring,
big fella?

1010
01:21:53.205 --> 01:21:54.373
I'll die...

1011
01:21:54.915 --> 01:21:57.125
Before I get back in that ring again.

1012
01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.460
Now...

1013
01:22:04.424 --> 01:22:07.969
Now, you could take
all of the rockefellers' money

1014
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:09.971
and all of the Kennedys' money,

1015
01:22:09.972 --> 01:22:11.597
and you put that together,

1016
01:22:11.598 --> 01:22:14.893
it wouldn't come to a down payment
on my getting back in that ring again.

1017
01:22:18.021 --> 01:22:20.314
Praise god. Thank you, Jesus.

1018
01:22:20.315 --> 01:22:22.317
Jesus is alive today.

1019
01:22:24.444 --> 01:22:25.444
I...

1020
01:22:26.029 --> 01:22:28.531
I felt bad for how I acted last Sunday.

1021
01:22:28.532 --> 01:22:31.326
- Well, how did you act?
- Kind of cold.

1022
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:35.663
- Yes.
- Well, you had a reputation.

1023
01:22:35.664 --> 01:22:37.541
And not a godly one.

1024
01:22:39.293 --> 01:22:40.711
Well, I'm different now.

1025
01:22:41.587 --> 01:22:44.005
You know, I hadn't yet learnt the secret

1026
01:22:44.006 --> 01:22:47.133
to enjoying every day for itself.

1027
01:22:47.134 --> 01:22:50.720
How to make the most of each day
as it comes.

1028
01:22:50.721 --> 01:22:52.097
Do you have children?

1029
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:56.100
Yes.

1030
01:22:56.977 --> 01:22:59.687
They don't live with me full-time,
you know, which is hard,

1031
01:22:59.688 --> 01:23:03.108
but I'm gonna be seeing
a whole lot more of them now.

1032
01:23:04.067 --> 01:23:05.067
Yes, indeed.

1033
01:23:06.028 --> 01:23:07.362
I'm glad to hear that.

1034
01:23:14.745 --> 01:23:16.496
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1035
01:23:45.943 --> 01:23:46.943
You okay?

1036
01:23:47.444 --> 01:23:49.988
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I thought we were going to a movie.

1037
01:23:52.533 --> 01:23:53.951
I wanna show you something.

1038
01:23:55.410 --> 01:23:57.162
What's that look like to you?

1039
01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:00.541
A church that's run out of faith.

1040
01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:03.252
No.

1041
01:24:04.086 --> 01:24:05.712
You know, I'm gonna buy it.

1042
01:24:07.256 --> 01:24:08.966
And I'm gonna preach in it.

1043
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:12.052
And be the best I can be.

1044
01:24:13.428 --> 01:24:15.347
And I'm gonna spread his word.

1045
01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:22.104
Do you believe I can do that?

1046
01:24:22.771 --> 01:24:23.772
Yes.

1047
01:24:24.439 --> 01:24:25.440
I do.

1048
01:24:32.197 --> 01:24:36.701
<i>You got to fight for your faith.
Every one of you, every day.</i>

1049
01:24:36.702 --> 01:24:41.164
One Sunday morning,
when the sun is shining real bright...

1050
01:24:44.251 --> 01:24:47.880
And your husband, he's standing there
with his swim trunks on,

1051
01:24:48.964 --> 01:24:50.174
holding a blanket,

1052
01:24:50.966 --> 01:24:52.885
saying, "the beach is waiting, baby!"

1053
01:24:53.677 --> 01:24:55.262
And you think to yourself, you say:

1054
01:24:57.014 --> 01:25:00.350
"Is missing one little service
really gonna hurt me?"

1055
01:25:03.312 --> 01:25:07.231
Now, if you don't shine your shoes,
do they get shined?

1056
01:25:07.232 --> 01:25:08.150
No.

1057
01:25:08.151 --> 01:25:11.027
- Don't wash your clothes, they get washed?
- No.

1058
01:25:11.028 --> 01:25:14.198
If you don't fight for your faith,
it'll fall away.

1059
01:25:15.699 --> 01:25:17.909
You gotta do it.
Gotta fight for your faith.

1060
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:19.535
If you gonna fight for anything,
fight for that.

1061
01:25:19.536 --> 01:25:20.536
Amen.

1062
01:25:22.372 --> 01:25:24.291
Thank you. All right. Take care.

1063
01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:26.501
All right. All right.

1064
01:25:26.502 --> 01:25:27.836
Pastor foreman.

1065
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:29.963
I need your help.

1066
01:25:31.006 --> 01:25:33.091
Would you train my grandson, Jalen?

1067
01:25:33.759 --> 01:25:36.052
If he had a good male role model
to teach him,

1068
01:25:36.053 --> 01:25:38.095
instead of the boys that he's...

1069
01:25:38.096 --> 01:25:42.600
Well, I'd sign up to train with Ali
but not the guy who lost to him.

1070
01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:45.978
- Jalen...
- It's all right. It's all right.

1071
01:25:45.979 --> 01:25:48.064
He remind me of myself when I was his age.

1072
01:25:48.065 --> 01:25:49.524
Can you teach him to box?

1073
01:25:49.525 --> 01:25:51.442
Well, boxing's not the answer.

1074
01:25:51.443 --> 01:25:53.277
You see, the answers are in here.

1075
01:25:53.278 --> 01:25:54.946
Young man, you read the Bible,

1076
01:25:54.947 --> 01:25:57.031
keep coming to church,
everything will work out.

1077
01:25:57.032 --> 01:25:59.742
All right.
All right, sister. God bless you.

1078
01:25:59.743 --> 01:26:01.578
- Have a good day. All right.
- Okay.

1079
01:26:02.538 --> 01:26:03.997
Something smells good in here.

1080
01:26:09.628 --> 01:26:11.255
- I love you.
- I love you.

1081
01:26:12.422 --> 01:26:13.423
Hey!

1082
01:26:15.133 --> 01:26:16.384
You're getting heavy.

1083
01:26:16.385 --> 01:26:17.468
Come here, boy.

1084
01:26:17.469 --> 01:26:19.011
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah.

1085
01:26:19.012 --> 01:26:21.138
- All right, let me get a kiss.
- No. No way.

1086
01:26:21.139 --> 01:26:23.516
Give me a kiss. Come here.
Don't wanna kiss your daddy?

1087
01:26:23.517 --> 01:26:26.686
{\an8}<i>...to the epidemic of street violence
that's been plaguing the fifth ward.</i>

1088
01:26:26.687 --> 01:26:29.230
{\an8}<i>Two suspects have been apprehended
in this robbery.</i>

1089
01:26:29.231 --> 01:26:31.983
<i>- An attempted robbery...</i>
- Take your brother to the other room.

1090
01:26:31.984 --> 01:26:33.985
<i>With one man in critical condition.</i>

1091
01:26:33.986 --> 01:26:36.613
{\an8}<i>The juveniles are being held without bail.</i>

1092
01:26:39.575 --> 01:26:40.576
You okay?

1093
01:26:45.998 --> 01:26:47.791
His grandmother brought him to me...

1094
01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:50.002
Last week.

1095
01:26:50.627 --> 01:26:51.920
That same kid.

1096
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:57.801
But I was so, you know,
full of myself being full of god that...

1097
01:27:00.804 --> 01:27:01.889
I missed it.

1098
01:27:02.806 --> 01:27:04.349
What did you miss, George?

1099
01:27:07.102 --> 01:27:09.188
I should have met that kid where he was.

1100
01:27:11.732 --> 01:27:13.483
Not where I wanted him to be.

1101
01:27:20.741 --> 01:27:23.952
George, are you sure you wanna do this?

1102
01:27:25.537 --> 01:27:26.538
Yeah.

1103
01:27:27.331 --> 01:27:31.877
Okay. I'll talk to the bank about moving
a few of your assets around.

1104
01:27:33.128 --> 01:27:34.838
Come on.
I wanna show y'all something here.

1105
01:27:36.089 --> 01:27:37.716
Now, I have an idea.

1106
01:27:48.477 --> 01:27:49.728
All right, I got you.

1107
01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:53.856
That's heavy.

1108
01:27:53.857 --> 01:27:55.984
Help me with this bed over here!

1109
01:27:59.863 --> 01:28:01.156
Hurry up, now.

1110
01:28:04.284 --> 01:28:05.869
That's looking good.

1111
01:28:11.959 --> 01:28:14.210
- Tighten up these ropes.
- Hook that up.

1112
01:28:14.211 --> 01:28:15.921
- Make sure they're not loose.
- Got it.

1113
01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.485
I would've blocked it,
but somebody raised the rim.

1114
01:28:39.486 --> 01:28:41.071
Hey, fellas. Come on in.

1115
01:28:42.114 --> 01:28:43.740
Come on in. Enjoy yourself.

1116
01:29:00.632 --> 01:29:02.550
Hey, Nate. Ain't seen you in a while.

1117
01:29:02.551 --> 01:29:05.345
Hey, nice haircut, man.
Look, it's almost as good as mine.

1118
01:29:07.181 --> 01:29:08.556
What's going on, y'all?

1119
01:29:08.557 --> 01:29:10.266
Hey, sister. How you doing?

1120
01:29:10.267 --> 01:29:11.434
Good, good.

1121
01:29:11.435 --> 01:29:14.688
Hey, man. You're always fouling somebody.
I see you.

1122
01:29:15.898 --> 01:29:17.065
Looking good.

1123
01:29:22.321 --> 01:29:23.405
I got this, y'all.

1124
01:29:24.072 --> 01:29:25.114
Don't worry about it.

1125
01:29:25.115 --> 01:29:28.201
This has never happened here
at the youth center before.

1126
01:29:28.202 --> 01:29:30.704
- This just doesn't make any sense.
- Roberta, what's going on?

1127
01:29:31.663 --> 01:29:35.292
Are you absolutely sure?
Because it just doesn't sound right.

1128
01:29:38.128 --> 01:29:42.090
Okay. No, I understand.
We'll take care of it immediately.

1129
01:29:46.303 --> 01:29:48.805
Power company said we never paid the bill.

1130
01:29:49.556 --> 01:29:50.556
Really?

1131
01:29:50.974 --> 01:29:54.061
Well, just get des on it.

1132
01:29:54.645 --> 01:29:56.188
He didn't come in today.

1133
01:29:57.564 --> 01:29:58.940
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Foreman,</i>

1134
01:29:58.941 --> 01:30:00.900
but I don't understand
how you didn't know.

1135
01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:02.026
How much is left?

1136
01:30:02.027 --> 01:30:03.903
A little over $2000.

1137
01:30:03.904 --> 01:30:05.197
That can't be right.

1138
01:30:06.365 --> 01:30:08.574
Just use some of the money
from my investments accounts

1139
01:30:08.575 --> 01:30:09.825
to keep the youth center open.

1140
01:30:09.826 --> 01:30:12.036
Those investments went belly-up
over the last year.

1141
01:30:12.037 --> 01:30:13.621
Des told me we were good.

1142
01:30:13.622 --> 01:30:15.581
I'm sorry, but that's just not true.

1143
01:30:15.582 --> 01:30:18.084
He put them into solid stocks
to set me up for life.

1144
01:30:18.085 --> 01:30:20.878
No. These were all high-risk gambles.

1145
01:30:20.879 --> 01:30:22.171
No, that's...

1146
01:30:22.172 --> 01:30:25.758
Look, I'm sorry, Mr. Foreman,
but if these payments aren't made soon,

1147
01:30:25.759 --> 01:30:28.512
the bank will have
to start repossessing the property.

1148
01:30:58.667 --> 01:31:01.461
Roy says you got the whole town
looking for Desmond.

1149
01:31:02.379 --> 01:31:03.380
That's right.

1150
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:06.842
You need to leave him be.

1151
01:31:09.011 --> 01:31:10.721
I gave it all to him.

1152
01:31:13.348 --> 01:31:14.641
And he lost it.

1153
01:31:17.352 --> 01:31:18.896
Not just the youth center.

1154
01:31:23.567 --> 01:31:26.195
Everything I worked for...

1155
01:31:29.781 --> 01:31:30.823
It's gone.

1156
01:31:30.824 --> 01:31:31.909
No, no, no.

1157
01:31:33.118 --> 01:31:36.330
Everything you worked for is in here.

1158
01:31:40.959 --> 01:31:43.170
Ever since you was a little boy...

1159
01:31:46.423 --> 01:31:49.009
I tried to put you on the right path.

1160
01:31:51.678 --> 01:31:52.846
But you found it.

1161
01:31:53.847 --> 01:31:55.265
All by yourself.

1162
01:31:56.308 --> 01:31:57.559
You found god.

1163
01:31:59.144 --> 01:32:00.312
Be godly.

1164
01:32:03.815 --> 01:32:06.944
Don't let Desmond baker take that
from you too.

1165
01:32:36.139 --> 01:32:37.139
Tell me.

1166
01:32:37.766 --> 01:32:41.895
Tell me you put the money somewhere else.
In some other account I don't know about!

1167
01:32:42.646 --> 01:32:44.814
- Tell me it's not all gone.
- It's gone.

1168
01:32:44.815 --> 01:32:47.525
- I lost it.
- Tell me it's not all gone.

1169
01:32:47.526 --> 01:32:48.819
I lost it.

1170
01:32:59.413 --> 01:33:01.164
I'm sorry, George.

1171
01:33:10.674 --> 01:33:12.843
Any time you're ready, Mr. Foreman.

1172
01:33:13.427 --> 01:33:16.053
This summer,
when you're out grilling with the family,

1173
01:33:16.054 --> 01:33:18.890
there's only one sauce
that has the sweetness and the spiceness

1174
01:33:18.891 --> 01:33:20.558
that everyone loves.

1175
01:33:20.559 --> 01:33:22.227
- Miss...
- You said "spiceness," George.

1176
01:33:23.061 --> 01:33:24.061
I did?

1177
01:33:24.062 --> 01:33:26.607
Yeah. "Spiceness" isn't a word.

1178
01:33:31.653 --> 01:33:34.030
Hi. How are you? Thank you.

1179
01:33:34.031 --> 01:33:36.533
Can you sign this, champ? Thank you.

1180
01:33:37.576 --> 01:33:38.576
- Hello.
- Hi.

1181
01:33:38.577 --> 01:33:39.661
Thank you so much.

1182
01:33:43.916 --> 01:33:45.125
Thank you so much.

1183
01:33:47.169 --> 01:33:48.378
Thank you.

1184
01:33:51.215 --> 01:33:53.049
When you're out grilling with the family,

1185
01:33:53.050 --> 01:33:57.053
there's only one sauce
that has the sweetness and the spice

1186
01:33:57.054 --> 01:33:58.680
that everyone loves.

1187
01:34:00.015 --> 01:34:03.351
Miss tammie's mesquite
and original barbecue sauce.

1188
01:34:03.352 --> 01:34:04.686
Get them while they're hot.

1189
01:34:06.355 --> 01:34:09.441
Adding in the money
from miss tammie's commercial...

1190
01:34:10.817 --> 01:34:12.027
Chump change.

1191
01:34:13.529 --> 01:34:16.447
That's what they pay you
for looking like a chump on TV.

1192
01:34:16.448 --> 01:34:18.491
Every little bit counts, George.

1193
01:34:18.492 --> 01:34:20.202
I done sold everything I have.

1194
01:34:21.995 --> 01:34:23.539
I done cut every corner.

1195
01:34:27.167 --> 01:34:28.168
How are we?

1196
01:34:32.923 --> 01:34:34.174
Short.

1197
01:34:34.758 --> 01:34:35.884
Well, how short?

1198
01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:38.387
Not even close.

1199
01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:11.812
I know you hate this thing.

1200
01:36:11.813 --> 01:36:13.649
It's just a bag. I don't hate it.

1201
01:36:14.274 --> 01:36:15.776
It is filthy though.

1202
01:36:18.487 --> 01:36:20.696
- Come to bed.
- I'm not tired.

1203
01:36:20.697 --> 01:36:22.657
But you have a sermon to give tomorrow.

1204
01:36:22.658 --> 01:36:24.283
Pastor Carl's filling in for me.

1205
01:36:24.284 --> 01:36:25.619
Why?

1206
01:36:27.204 --> 01:36:29.205
So I ain't gotta stand up there,

1207
01:36:29.206 --> 01:36:31.290
tell all those people
how they should live.

1208
01:36:31.291 --> 01:36:33.376
That's what a pastor does, right?

1209
01:36:33.377 --> 01:36:35.754
It's my fault the money's gone, Joan.

1210
01:36:36.463 --> 01:36:37.839
Don't say that, George.

1211
01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.591
Well, I knew what des was.

1212
01:36:41.176 --> 01:36:42.886
And I trusted him anyway?

1213
01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:55.148
I need to fight again.

1214
01:36:59.194 --> 01:37:00.988
You swore you wouldn't.

1215
01:37:04.116 --> 01:37:07.077
That moment when you first
came up to me in church,

1216
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:11.455
I saw a man who wanted to change his life.

1217
01:37:11.456 --> 01:37:13.500
I fell in love with that man.

1218
01:37:14.543 --> 01:37:17.837
The old you, I don't know.

1219
01:37:17.838 --> 01:37:19.298
And I don't want to.

1220
01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:21.340
Joan.

1221
01:37:22.509 --> 01:37:24.928
There's only two things I know how to do.

1222
01:37:26.597 --> 01:37:28.849
That's box and preach.

1223
01:37:31.685 --> 01:37:32.853
But preaching...

1224
01:37:36.773 --> 01:37:38.567
Preaching won't pay the bills.

1225
01:37:39.318 --> 01:37:41.403
What if all your rage comes back?

1226
01:37:45.324 --> 01:37:47.284
What if you can't win without it?

1227
01:37:51.705 --> 01:37:54.081
Step forward. Step back.

1228
01:37:54.082 --> 01:37:56.460
Step to the left. To the right.

1229
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:59.295
Step forward. Step back.

1230
01:37:59.296 --> 01:38:02.048
Step left. Step right.

1231
01:38:02.049 --> 01:38:04.467
Step forward. Step back.

1232
01:38:04.468 --> 01:38:06.761
Step left. Step right. Great.

1233
01:38:06.762 --> 01:38:09.306
Now. Now, cut me off! Cut me off.

1234
01:38:12.267 --> 01:38:13.644
<i>When you quit boxing...</i>

1235
01:38:16.438 --> 01:38:18.440
You dang near broke my heart.

1236
01:38:21.151 --> 01:38:22.694
It felt like you quit me.

1237
01:38:25.781 --> 01:38:27.074
But I came back here.

1238
01:38:27.699 --> 01:38:29.201
I dug back in.

1239
01:38:30.077 --> 01:38:31.077
And...

1240
01:38:31.787 --> 01:38:33.621
You know, funny thing happened.

1241
01:38:33.622 --> 01:38:35.666
I remembered who I was.

1242
01:38:38.710 --> 01:38:40.295
I'm happy here, George.

1243
01:38:41.588 --> 01:38:43.590
You made me something once, doc.

1244
01:38:45.217 --> 01:38:46.843
You can do it again.

1245
01:38:46.844 --> 01:38:49.137
Joe Louis tried to come back.

1246
01:38:49.847 --> 01:38:52.014
Marciano almost killed him in the ring.

1247
01:38:52.015 --> 01:38:56.018
Joe Louis tried to start at the top.
But we'll start at the bottom.

1248
01:38:56.019 --> 01:38:58.771
You're old. They'll call us a circus act.

1249
01:38:58.772 --> 01:39:00.816
But not if we keep winning.

1250
01:39:01.441 --> 01:39:02.442
Doc.

1251
01:39:03.735 --> 01:39:05.821
You know, we can do something here.

1252
01:39:06.947 --> 01:39:09.950
Something that's beyond their imagination.

1253
01:39:11.410 --> 01:39:16.582
The morning that we wake up to fight
for that heavyweight championship belt...

1254
01:39:17.624 --> 01:39:19.959
Oh, man,

1255
01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.962
the air's gonna taste different.

1256
01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:26.258
The sun, that's gonna look different.

1257
01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:30.929
Only two men
on this whole earth is gonna matter.

1258
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:33.265
And we'll be the both of them.

1259
01:39:41.815 --> 01:39:42.941
How much you weigh?

1260
01:39:44.234 --> 01:39:45.610
How much I wait?

1261
01:39:45.611 --> 01:39:47.945
I said, how much do you weigh?

1262
01:39:47.946 --> 01:39:49.323
Oh, how much I weigh.

1263
01:39:50.490 --> 01:39:52.576
- Like on a scale.
- Yeah.

1264
01:39:55.913 --> 01:39:58.664
About 299.

1265
01:39:58.665 --> 01:40:02.001
Really more toward the 85 range,
but about 29...

1266
01:40:02.002 --> 01:40:03.461
I would say 299.

1267
01:40:03.462 --> 01:40:05.797
Last I checked, lying was a sin.

1268
01:40:09.927 --> 01:40:12.678
I'm about 315,

1269
01:40:12.679 --> 01:40:15.057
318 after breakfast.

1270
01:40:15.891 --> 01:40:18.185
You get down to 265...

1271
01:40:19.645 --> 01:40:20.687
Then call me.

1272
01:40:39.373 --> 01:40:41.166
I think my gym clothes shrunk.

1273
01:40:55.556 --> 01:40:57.432
Hey, George, take it easy, man.

1274
01:40:58.517 --> 01:41:00.060
You're gonna have a heart attack.

1275
01:41:04.022 --> 01:41:05.566
That's nasty, George.

1276
01:41:35.387 --> 01:41:37.346
All right, who's ready for pancakes?

1277
01:41:37.347 --> 01:41:40.017
I'm ready for pancakes. Yes, indeed.

1278
01:41:41.268 --> 01:41:42.310
There you go, baby.

1279
01:41:42.311 --> 01:41:45.147
Yep. I'm gonna get me, like, five of them.

1280
01:42:51.255 --> 01:42:53.966
Okay. Get on up there.

1281
01:42:54.591 --> 01:42:55.968
That's where the fighting is.

1282
01:42:59.012 --> 01:43:00.013
Time!

1283
01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:16.655
Come on, cut him off!

1284
01:43:18.365 --> 01:43:19.658
Cut him off!

1285
01:43:20.492 --> 01:43:21.785
Cut him off!

1286
01:43:28.125 --> 01:43:29.293
Move your feet.

1287
01:43:32.963 --> 01:43:34.673
Come on. Come on, George.

1288
01:43:37.509 --> 01:43:38.635
Time!

1289
01:43:45.225 --> 01:43:48.186
We're gonna need
to get you some new tricks.

1290
01:43:48.187 --> 01:43:51.732
Some new arms
and some new legs might help too.

1291
01:43:52.941 --> 01:43:55.652
This ain't funny, George.
This ain't funny.

1292
01:44:24.348 --> 01:44:25.432
What's wrong?

1293
01:44:30.729 --> 01:44:33.732
I think the lord spoke to me last night.

1294
01:44:47.579 --> 01:44:49.081
Well, what'd he say?

1295
01:44:53.085 --> 01:44:54.711
He showed me a vision.

1296
01:44:56.338 --> 01:44:57.339
Of you.

1297
01:44:57.923 --> 01:45:00.843
Winning
the heavyweight championship again.

1298
01:45:05.389 --> 01:45:06.890
I can't explain it.

1299
01:45:09.142 --> 01:45:10.143
It's like...

1300
01:45:11.979 --> 01:45:16.023
He's gonna lift you up
in the middle of that ring,

1301
01:45:16.024 --> 01:45:19.528
so you'll lift him up
in front of millions of people.

1302
01:45:41.175 --> 01:45:42.593
How you feeling?

1303
01:45:44.887 --> 01:45:45.888
I feel good.

1304
01:45:46.597 --> 01:45:48.182
This is for real tonight.

1305
01:45:49.558 --> 01:45:52.769
It's time to wake up that old tiger
and put him back to work.

1306
01:45:54.438 --> 01:45:55.814
That man's gone, doc.

1307
01:45:57.274 --> 01:45:59.025
We gonna do this a new way now.

1308
01:45:59.026 --> 01:46:01.153
Son, there's no new way
when it come to that ring.

1309
01:46:01.945 --> 01:46:03.613
There's him and there's you.

1310
01:46:03.614 --> 01:46:05.824
There's hurt or be hurt.

1311
01:46:06.742 --> 01:46:08.493
- It's fighting.
- It's boxing.

1312
01:46:10.454 --> 01:46:11.455
It's a sport.

1313
01:46:12.706 --> 01:46:13.707
With rules.

1314
01:46:18.545 --> 01:46:20.214
Better know what you're doing.

1315
01:46:39.775 --> 01:46:44.278
It's been ten years since George foreman
set foot in a boxing ring.

1316
01:46:44.279 --> 01:46:48.032
What does
this foreman reincarnation even look like?

1317
01:46:48.033 --> 01:46:51.994
Hey, zouski's no world champion,
but he's a seasoned fighter,

1318
01:46:51.995 --> 01:46:53.955
and George has danger in there tonight.

1319
01:46:53.956 --> 01:46:56.374
You know what scares me
the most about tonight?

1320
01:46:56.375 --> 01:46:57.709
Getting knocked out by a bum?

1321
01:46:58.377 --> 01:46:59.377
No.

1322
01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.256
Taking my robe off
in front of all these people.

1323
01:47:02.881 --> 01:47:05.424
The last time they saw me,
I looked like Superman.

1324
01:47:05.425 --> 01:47:09.054
So now you look like the michelin man.
This ain't no beauty contest.

1325
01:47:16.436 --> 01:47:17.479
All right!

1326
01:47:27.614 --> 01:47:31.200
Gentlemen, I gave you instructions
in the dressing room.

1327
01:47:31.201 --> 01:47:33.411
Obey my commands.

1328
01:47:33.412 --> 01:47:36.539
Give me a good clean fight. George...

1329
01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:39.542
Don't look at him.
He's trying to mess with your mind.

1330
01:47:39.543 --> 01:47:40.627
Touch them up.

1331
01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:42.713
Come on, let's go.

1332
01:47:47.885 --> 01:47:52.471
So George foreman begins
the most unlikely of comebacks.

1333
01:47:52.472 --> 01:47:55.309
- All right, George.
- Keep your hands up. Keep your hands up.

1334
01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:00.521
This Sacramento crowd is getting restless.

1335
01:48:00.522 --> 01:48:03.358
- Quit dancing!
- They're looking for some action.

1336
01:48:08.322 --> 01:48:09.907
Stop playing with him.

1337
01:48:14.119 --> 01:48:16.496
You come here to fight
or you wanna go home? Come on!

1338
01:48:17.164 --> 01:48:18.916
Let's do this. Let's fight.
You wanna fight?

1339
01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:27.716
There it is.

1340
01:48:31.178 --> 01:48:33.055
Cheap shot after the bell.

1341
01:48:50.697 --> 01:48:51.740
Let him out.

1342
01:48:53.242 --> 01:48:56.035
It's now or never.
You let him out. Let him out.

1343
01:48:56.036 --> 01:48:57.663
I'm gonna do this my way, doc.

1344
01:48:59.331 --> 01:49:00.707
I'm gonna do it my way.

1345
01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:18.517
I'll tell you this,
George can still punch.

1346
01:49:23.397 --> 01:49:25.983
Come on! Hit him like you hit Frazier!

1347
01:49:30.404 --> 01:49:32.990
Finish him!

1348
01:49:35.826 --> 01:49:38.494
He has zouski in huge trouble.

1349
01:49:38.495 --> 01:49:40.205
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

1350
01:49:41.290 --> 01:49:43.583
Come on, man.
Can't you see he's hurt? Stop the fight.

1351
01:49:43.584 --> 01:49:45.085
Do your job. Come on.

1352
01:49:46.295 --> 01:49:47.462
Do your job.

1353
01:49:48.255 --> 01:49:49.882
Come on, George.

1354
01:49:53.635 --> 01:49:57.638
- That's enough. That's enough.
- And it's done. The ref has seen enough.

1355
01:49:57.639 --> 01:50:01.435
Foreman takes his first step back
with a big win.

1356
01:50:11.111 --> 01:50:13.905
Let's hear it
for fat, old, bald guys, huh?

1357
01:50:13.906 --> 01:50:16.158
Yeah! Go get them, George!

1358
01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:21.662
<i>That rumble you hear is
the George foreman comeback express.</i>

1359
01:50:21.663 --> 01:50:24.624
<i>You best believe
it's picking up some serious steam.</i>

1360
01:50:24.625 --> 01:50:26.042
<i>There's an old saying:</i>

1361
01:50:26.043 --> 01:50:28.044
<i>"It's not the size
of the man in the fight,</i>

1362
01:50:28.045 --> 01:50:30.421
<i>but the size of the fight in the man."</i>

1363
01:50:30.422 --> 01:50:34.008
<i>All those ring experts
who were making fun of George's size</i>

1364
01:50:34.009 --> 01:50:35.844
<i>sure aren't laughing anymore.</i>

1365
01:50:36.678 --> 01:50:40.390
<i>Foreman is forcing the boxing world
to stand up and pay attention.</i>

1366
01:50:41.058 --> 01:50:44.852
<i>Never before has a boxer stayed away
from the ring this long,</i>

1367
01:50:44.853 --> 01:50:46.854
<i>then fought his way back into contention.</i>

1368
01:50:46.855 --> 01:50:50.234
<i>Just how far, how high can he take this?</i>

1369
01:50:55.989 --> 01:50:59.659
Back tonight, please welcome
former heavyweight champion of the world,

1370
01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:01.078
George foreman.

1371
01:51:02.663 --> 01:51:04.540
- Good to see you, George.
- Good to see you.

1372
01:51:06.083 --> 01:51:07.708
Now, tell me, George,

1373
01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:11.045
all these guys you've been fighting,
where do you find them?

1374
01:51:11.046 --> 01:51:14.800
Gas stations, barrooms,
and bowling alleys, mostly.

1375
01:51:16.426 --> 01:51:19.262
- Sounds like pretty stiff competition.
- Oh, yeah.

1376
01:51:19.263 --> 01:51:21.806
But I'm tired of people saying
I'll only fight these guys

1377
01:51:21.807 --> 01:51:24.767
unless they on respirators,
'cause that's a lie.

1378
01:51:24.768 --> 01:51:28.146
They gotta be off the respirator
at least five days before I fight them.

1379
01:51:29.481 --> 01:51:31.232
Now, tell us about your sons, George.

1380
01:51:31.233 --> 01:51:32.483
I got four boys.

1381
01:51:32.484 --> 01:51:34.527
Now, the names are, again...?

1382
01:51:34.528 --> 01:51:39.074
George foreman Jr., George foreman III,
George foreman iv, and George foreman v.

1383
01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:43.536
I wanted them all to have something
in common. No different names.

1384
01:51:43.537 --> 01:51:45.955
If one goes up, we all go up.

1385
01:51:45.956 --> 01:51:48.666
If one gets in trouble,
we all get in trouble.

1386
01:51:48.667 --> 01:51:49.751
How about that?

1387
01:51:51.128 --> 01:51:54.380
You're going to fight evander holyfield
in Atlantic city, right?

1388
01:51:54.381 --> 01:51:55.464
Yes!

1389
01:51:55.465 --> 01:51:59.051
It is my destiny to win
the heavyweight championship belt again.

1390
01:51:59.052 --> 01:52:00.679
It is time, kids!

1391
01:52:02.514 --> 01:52:04.433
Okay, all right. Here we go.

1392
01:52:06.602 --> 01:52:09.020
{\an8}<i>And we're back for the seventh round.</i>

1393
01:52:09.021 --> 01:52:11.731
{\an8}<i>Holyfield, as expected,
is well ahead on the cards.</i>

1394
01:52:11.732 --> 01:52:12.816
Your will, lord.

1395
01:52:14.151 --> 01:52:17.070
{\an8}<i>And he rocks foreman again
with a vicious left.</i>

1396
01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.033
{\an8}<i>George is still standing.
But for how long?</i>

1397
01:52:22.367 --> 01:52:24.286
<i>It's foreman on the attack now.</i>

1398
01:52:25.078 --> 01:52:26.496
That's it, George.

1399
01:52:27.664 --> 01:52:30.125
{\an8}<i>What a shot! Holyfield is wobbly.</i>

1400
01:52:31.084 --> 01:52:34.880
<i>Solid punches! Nobody thought
foreman would even last this long.</i>

1401
01:52:36.048 --> 01:52:38.257
- Get him.
<i>- A round for the ages.</i>

1402
01:52:38.258 --> 01:52:41.135
<i>George foreman is for real.</i>

1403
01:52:41.136 --> 01:52:43.304
<i>And the crowd is up on its feet.</i>

1404
01:52:43.305 --> 01:52:49.310
<i>117 to 100,
for the winner by unanimous decision,</i>

1405
01:52:49.311 --> 01:52:55.024
<i>and still undisputed heavyweight champion
of the world,</i>

1406
01:52:55.025 --> 01:53:00.280
<i>evander holyfield.</i>

1407
01:53:02.866 --> 01:53:04.284
Mr. Foreman.

1408
01:53:05.911 --> 01:53:06.953
Great fight.

1409
01:53:06.954 --> 01:53:09.163
One more round
and you would have had him.

1410
01:53:09.164 --> 01:53:10.164
Thank you.

1411
01:53:15.337 --> 01:53:16.421
Have a seat.

1412
01:53:20.926 --> 01:53:22.176
Good morning.

1413
01:53:22.177 --> 01:53:23.511
What brings you in today?

1414
01:53:23.512 --> 01:53:26.223
I just wanna stay
on top of things this time.

1415
01:53:26.849 --> 01:53:29.434
- Did the hbo check come in?
- Just this morning.

1416
01:53:30.102 --> 01:53:33.272
They said they were hoping
to just break even on the fight.

1417
01:53:40.404 --> 01:53:41.405
What?

1418
01:53:52.624 --> 01:53:54.917
I think you'll enjoy
the rest of your statement too.

1419
01:53:54.918 --> 01:53:56.836
That funny little grill deal you signed

1420
01:53:56.837 --> 01:53:59.714
is starting to generate
some substantial checks.

1421
01:53:59.715 --> 01:54:00.840
Really?

1422
01:54:00.841 --> 01:54:04.135
I'm just surprised
they chose a big, old fat guy like me

1423
01:54:04.136 --> 01:54:06.096
to sell a grill to help people get lean.

1424
01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:07.763
The youth center?

1425
01:54:07.764 --> 01:54:11.268
There's enough money in the account
to keep it open a very long time.

1426
01:54:11.935 --> 01:54:14.615
I think it's safe to say you never have
to fight again, Mr. Foreman.

1427
01:54:15.647 --> 01:54:17.566
Oh, praise the lord.

1428
01:54:22.696 --> 01:54:23.822
What is it?

1429
01:54:26.909 --> 01:54:28.410
Our job isn't over.

1430
01:54:31.997 --> 01:54:34.041
Maybe I heard him wrong, George.

1431
01:54:35.918 --> 01:54:37.336
You heard him right.

1432
01:54:39.087 --> 01:54:40.088
Your vision...

1433
01:54:43.050 --> 01:54:44.676
It was real.

1434
01:54:45.511 --> 01:54:46.845
He did his part.

1435
01:54:47.679 --> 01:54:49.806
We have to do ours.

1436
01:55:00.025 --> 01:55:01.859
<i>The fight is on.</i>

1437
01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:04.654
<i>Three years after he lost
to evander holyfield,</i>

1438
01:55:04.655 --> 01:55:07.448
<i>big George foreman,
who's now 45 years old,</i>

1439
01:55:07.449 --> 01:55:10.660
<i>has fought his way back to a title fight.</i>

1440
01:55:10.661 --> 01:55:13.329
<i>But he might wanna be careful
what he wishes for.</i>

1441
01:55:13.330 --> 01:55:17.208
<i>Michael moorer, the newly-minted
heavyweight champion of the world.</i>

1442
01:55:17.209 --> 01:55:19.710
<i>A new champion, in his prime,</i>

1443
01:55:19.711 --> 01:55:23.465
<i>with speed, power, and a fluid arsenal.</i>

1444
01:55:24.842 --> 01:55:28.636
<i>Thirty of moorer's 35 wins
have come by knockout.</i>

1445
01:55:28.637 --> 01:55:30.764
<i>He is very difficult to fight.</i>

1446
01:55:31.431 --> 01:55:34.267
<i>The first southpaw champion
in heavyweight history,</i>

1447
01:55:34.268 --> 01:55:36.978
<i>and he boasts a win
over evander holyfield,</i>

1448
01:55:36.979 --> 01:55:39.021
<i>who battered big George.</i>

1449
01:55:39.022 --> 01:55:43.442
<i>There has never been
a 45-year-old heavyweight champion.</i>

1450
01:55:43.443 --> 01:55:46.654
<i>The risk here
to George foreman isn't losing,</i>

1451
01:55:46.655 --> 01:55:48.030
<i>it's surviving.</i>

1452
01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:49.408
How can you beat that man?

1453
01:56:28.238 --> 01:56:29.740
Get out of the pocket.

1454
01:56:33.744 --> 01:56:34.744
Come on, now.

1455
01:56:38.415 --> 01:56:40.833
Looks like the myth
of George foreman's power

1456
01:56:40.834 --> 01:56:43.253
is being exposed by moorer so far.

1457
01:56:44.796 --> 01:56:46.214
Come on, son. What are you doing?

1458
01:56:46.215 --> 01:56:48.299
Solid right hand by moorer.

1459
01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:51.385
<i>Foreman's taking a beating,
way behind on every scorecard.</i>

1460
01:56:51.386 --> 01:56:53.679
<i>Every time George lands
something significant,</i>

1461
01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:56.516
<i>moorer comes back
with two or three punches of his own.</i>

1462
01:56:56.517 --> 01:57:00.019
<i>He's having a difficult time
with the younger and faster fighter.</i>

1463
01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:01.354
<i>George has no timing.</i>

1464
01:57:01.355 --> 01:57:05.234
<i>He's very slow and sluggish.
I thought he'd be sharper than this.</i>

1465
01:57:08.529 --> 01:57:10.948
Moorer's cutting up George like a Turkey.

1466
01:57:13.534 --> 01:57:14.742
Our guy's got nothing left.

1467
01:57:14.743 --> 01:57:16.786
Easy. Easy.

1468
01:57:16.787 --> 01:57:19.330
Foreman's left eye beginning to close.

1469
01:57:19.331 --> 01:57:21.750
Well, now he just looks so tired, Jim.

1470
01:57:23.418 --> 01:57:25.211
He deserves all the credit in the world,

1471
01:57:25.212 --> 01:57:28.924
but he is a 45-year-old man
in a young man's game.

1472
01:57:35.055 --> 01:57:38.725
Uppercut by moorer,
blasted foreman's chin backward.

1473
01:57:42.479 --> 01:57:44.523
Oh, god. Protect him.

1474
01:57:58.871 --> 01:58:01.123
<i>I've been fighting all my life.</i>

1475
01:58:04.835 --> 01:58:06.502
<i>For a long time,</i>

1476
01:58:06.503 --> 01:58:09.173
<i>I fought
because I felt hated by the world.</i>

1477
01:58:11.341 --> 01:58:13.051
Poor-man!

1478
01:58:20.184 --> 01:58:22.268
<i>I call it the "ghetto whopper."</i>

1479
01:58:22.269 --> 01:58:24.938
<i>I will fight George foreman
anywhere, any time.</i>

1480
01:58:37.576 --> 01:58:38.994
<i>But I've changed.</i>

1481
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:45.082
Nine rounds against the best in the world.

1482
01:58:45.083 --> 01:58:48.085
There's no shame, son. No shame.

1483
01:58:48.086 --> 01:58:50.005
He's all right. He's all right.

1484
01:58:54.301 --> 01:58:55.427
You okay?

1485
01:59:10.776 --> 01:59:12.611
Come on, George. Come on.

1486
01:59:21.662 --> 01:59:24.914
<i>I had to get knocked down
all the way to the bottom</i>

1487
01:59:24.915 --> 01:59:26.083
<i>to finally see...</i>

1488
01:59:29.294 --> 01:59:33.131
<i>Everything I was searching for
was already there.</i>

1489
01:59:44.893 --> 01:59:45.936
<i>And with that...</i>

1490
01:59:47.729 --> 01:59:50.566
<i>You can do the impossible.</i>

1491
01:59:56.530 --> 01:59:58.531
Down goes moorer on a right hand!

1492
01:59:58.532 --> 02:00:01.410
An unbelievably close-in, right-hand shot.

1493
02:00:04.913 --> 02:00:07.832
- I don't believe it.
- It happened!

1494
02:00:07.833 --> 02:00:10.168
Five. Six.

1495
02:00:10.169 --> 02:00:12.753
- Stay down. Stay down.
<i>- Seven.</i>

1496
02:00:12.754 --> 02:00:16.675
Eight. Nine. Ten.

1497
02:00:17.926 --> 02:00:19.344
It happened!

1498
02:00:20.762 --> 02:00:24.099
George foreman is
the new heavyweight champ of the world.

1499
02:00:33.066 --> 02:00:35.568
The boxer turned preacher
is down on his knees,

1500
02:00:35.569 --> 02:00:39.072
not in defeat,
but in victory and Thanksgiving.

1501
02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:56.089
Thank you.

1502
02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.050
No, thank you.

1503
02:00:59.259 --> 02:01:01.220
You're the heavyweight champion
of the world.

1504
02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:05.807
- We did it.
- We did it.

1505
02:01:10.938 --> 02:01:11.939
We did it.

1506
02:01:23.617 --> 02:01:29.330
I have never seen anything like this
in the 25 years of my career, Gil.

1507
02:01:29.331 --> 02:01:34.419
Oldest heavyweight champion
in the world ever, George foreman.
