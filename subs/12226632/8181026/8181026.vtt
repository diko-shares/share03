00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.965
<i>I was 28 years old when I died.</i>

1
00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:22.581
<i>My life started
in the Fifth Wards in Houston.</i>

2
00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:25.668
<i>Those were some of the toughest streets
in all of Texas.</i>

3
00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:28.171
Come on down.

4
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.298
<i>Nothing ever came easy.</i>

5
00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.009
<i>Every day was a fight.</i>

6
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:57.867
Oh, Lord.

7
00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.045
We'll have electric
soon as I can manage it.

8
00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:21.681
Gloria.

9
00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:23.475
Mary.

10
00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.354
Here you go, Roy.

11
00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:28.773
And George.

12
00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.864
Thank God for the food first, y'all.

13
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.617
Bow your heads.

14
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.704
Heavenly Father, thank you for this food.

15
00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:47.542
You know exactly what this family needs.

16
00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:51.086
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

17
00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:52.880
- Amen.
- Amen.

18
00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:02.598
I'm so hungry, I could eat this table.

19
00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.231
Thank you, Mary.

20
00:03:10.898 --> 00:03:12.859
<i>Mary always saw the good in me.</i>

21
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.278
<i>I loved her for that.</i>

22
00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.544
Listen.

23
00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:36.299
I'll be going to work all day tomorrow,

24
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:40.428
so you follow Gloria to your new school
in the morning. You hear?

25
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:47.476
If you get held back another year,
you won't ever catch back up.

26
00:03:49.937 --> 00:03:52.899
So promise me you won't fight.

27
00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:56.861
I promise.

28
00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:26.264
- Good morning, class.
- Good morning.

29
00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:28.768
Everyone turn to Page 16 in your books.

30
00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:34.357
Who wants to read out loud?

31
00:04:54.418 --> 00:04:56.796
Jason, take us away.

32
00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.508
"Texas is called the Lone Star State..."

33
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:27.285
What you looking at, Foreman?

34
00:05:28.744 --> 00:05:29.995
Nothing.

35
00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.623
What's wrong?
Can't you even afford a piece of bread?

36
00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.170
How about this nasty skin?

37
00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:38.795
You want it?

38
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:43.341
Go get it.

39
00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.763
George should change his name
from Foreman to "Poor-man."

40
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.766
It's Foreman.

41
00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:54.145
What's that, Poor-man?

42
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.317
What?

43
00:06:03.487 --> 00:06:06.532
What's my name now, fool?
Say it! Say my name!

44
00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.793
<i>Anger was my answer to everything.</i>

45
00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.798
<i>And I couldn't stop myself from fighting.</i>

46
00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.010
<i>It was the only thing I did well.</i>

47
00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.088
Excuse me, sir.

48
00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:47.008
Hey!

49
00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:50.927
- No!
- Get down.

50
00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:52.387
Hold his hands, man.

51
00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:53.472
His wallet.

52
00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:56.642
Surprise, boys.

53
00:07:57.768 --> 00:07:59.478
Been busy around here, huh?

54
00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:05.443
Police! Stop right there!

55
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.304
They've gotta be somewhere around here.

56
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.232
Come on, Butch.

57
00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.444
Someone said they saw him over there.

58
00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:52.698
- Let me know what you see.
- Come on, boy. Find him.

59
00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.116
Find him.

60
00:08:55.117 --> 00:08:57.119
Let's do it, boy. Go.

61
00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.250
You got something?

62
00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.417
Find him, boy.

63
00:09:04.418 --> 00:09:06.045
All right. Find him.

64
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.220
We got you. Find him!

65
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.894
- Come on, boy.
- Try the next block over.

66
00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:23.896
Come on, boy.

67
00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:29.527
Let's go. He can't have gotten far.

68
00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:48.879
<i>If you left school
and you're between 16 and 22,</i>

69
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.008
<i>Job Corps will teach you the skills
that can help you get a good job.</i>

70
00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.719
<i>In Job Corps,
you live at a Job Corps center,</i>

71
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.846
<i>get free medical and dental care,</i>

72
00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:01.975
<i>clean clothes, your own bed to sleep in,
three square meals a day.</i>

73
00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:04.186
<i>You even get paid while you're learning.</i>

74
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:07.106
<i>Just for once, give yourself a chance.</i>

75
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.610
It's called the Job Corps.

76
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:19.035
You get an education and training,
so you can get a job.

77
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.621
They pay you a little each month too.

78
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.375
And where will they send you?

79
00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:28.836
I don't know.

80
00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.089
Wherever they want, I guess.

81
00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.228
Look at me.

82
00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:48.773
You've got more inside
than what you're showing.

83
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.275
I know it, Mom.

84
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.448
You wanna do this Job Corps?

85
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.033
Yes.

86
00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.119
Then do it right, George.

87
00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.623
Don't come running back home
'cause you're missing me.

88
00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:09.001
Finish what you start this time.

89
00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:13.005
I will.

90
00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:25.267
We will teach you job skills.
We will give you training.

91
00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:28.144
We will teach you respect for yourself,
as well as for others.

92
00:11:28.145 --> 00:11:31.273
We will show you a way forward,
no matter your past.

93
00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.358
Come on, son.

94
00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:36.403
Welcome to the Job Corps,
the start of your now-bright future.

95
00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:37.529
Here's your linens.

96
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.906
Got a name, big guy?

97
00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.449
Yeah, I got a name.

98
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.201
George Foreman.

99
00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:45.328
Barracks are gonna be
in the southwest corner.

100
00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:46.329
Lights out at 10.

101
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.750
No drinking, no smoking,
no cursing, no women, no fighting.

102
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.546
- Do y'all feed us here?
- Three meals a day at the chow hall.

103
00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.091
Served by the one and only Mrs. Moon.

104
00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:16.903
It's just a bed, man.

105
00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:19.841
Turn that off.

106
00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.061
- Got something against music?
- Maybe I do.

107
00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:35.063
Are you always this pissed off?

108
00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:36.649
When I'm trying to study.

109
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.292
Now I know why you're here.

110
00:13:57.003 --> 00:14:01.048
I'm here
because I've got unrealized potential.

111
00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:03.133
That's according to my old man.

112
00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:06.012
He said, "Don't come home
until you start realizing it."

113
00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:12.351
Let's go challenge C-dorm
to a game, huh? What do you say?

114
00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:18.858
Guess I'll just hit the chow hall.

115
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:20.902
Alone.

116
00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.324
Now you're talking.

117
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.540
You probably just left them
in the locker room.

118
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:38.586
No. Somebody stole them.

119
00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.837
You gotta calm down, man.

120
00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:45.885
Look, why don't we just report it
to the office right after we eat, okay?

121
00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:51.681
You got me to thank for those brownies.

122
00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:54.310
Why is that? I don't see no apron on you.

123
00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:57.938
Yeah, well, they realized
I'm a whiz with numbers.

124
00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:01.149
So they got me checking
over the order for the whole cafeteria.

125
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.609
Well, I spotted something.

126
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.113
A unit of brownies costs less
than a unit of beans.

127
00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:07.822
So what?

128
00:15:07.823 --> 00:15:11.159
"So what?" So I switched a few numbers
on the weekly ordering sheet.

129
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.705
And under my new cost-cutting plans,
we got a whole lot more brownies.

130
00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.376
And a whole lot of less gas.

131
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:27.592
What?

132
00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:57.915
What are you doing?

133
00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:05.214
Open up!

134
00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:07.048
Open up!

135
00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:14.806
- Take my shoes? You take my shoes?
- No! Please, no!

136
00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.268
Give me them! You gonna steal my shoes?

137
00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.269
- My mama gave me them shoes!
- No!

138
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.563
What do you think you're doing, corpsman?

139
00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:24.483
- Don't drop me!
- Let go of him! Stop it, stop it!

140
00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.611
Go on out of here. Get out of here.

141
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:34.493
Where you think you're going?

142
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.998
Is that your artwork?

143
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.171
Let's walk and talk.

144
00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.095
Mr. Broadus.

145
00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.556
That was federal property
you destroyed back there.

146
00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:58.016
I only got two choices.

147
00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.435
Either I send you to prison,
or I send you home.

148
00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.146
That boy stole my shoes.

149
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.940
My mama worked hard to give me those.

150
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:07.527
- Where's all that rage coming from?
- I don't have any rage.

151
00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:09.987
Get in the car.

152
00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.786
In the time you've been here,

153
00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:20.039
you punched out three corpsmen...

154
00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.540
and one innocent door.

155
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:23.916
They disrespected me.

156
00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:25.127
The door too?

157
00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:33.052
You got money for a bus ticket?

158
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.056
No.

159
00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:43.145
Here you go.

160
00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:04.667
I can't go home, Mr. Broadus.

161
00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:11.507
I can't.

162
00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:14.385
This place...

163
00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.555
it's all I have.

164
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:22.977
Please?

165
00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.138
You ever box?

166
00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.809
Just street fights.

167
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.605
I'm talking about boxing, not fighting.

168
00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:09.357
It's a sport.

169
00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:11.442
With rules.

170
00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.530
I heard it on the radio.

171
00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:19.659
I teach it.

172
00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:24.664
You're big enough and ugly enough.

173
00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:27.208
You wanna learn it?

174
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:30.920
Yes, sir.

175
00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:34.590
Don't make me regret this.

176
00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:44.766
George, this is Royce.

177
00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:46.853
He's gonna be your opponent today.

178
00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:50.022
Don't worry, big man. I'll be gentle.

179
00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:53.985
That's just a sign
of sportsmanship before you fight.

180
00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:56.570
To show that you're not here
to kill each other.

181
00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:58.280
You're just two athletes

182
00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:00.491
trying to find out
who's best at the sport.

183
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:02.743
So to do that...

184
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:06.913
boxers touch gloves, like this:

185
00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.915
All right? Let's go.

186
00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:11.002
Let's get on up there.
Let me see what you got.

187
00:20:29.687 --> 00:20:33.441
- All right, Royce, show him what's what.
- When I say "time," you come out fighting.

188
00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:41.199
Anyone want action? Want action, huh?

189
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.534
Leroy Jackson, huh?

190
00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:47.371
Time!

191
00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.085
Get him, Royce! Get him!

192
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.343
Be still!

193
00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:14.315
Hit him, George.

194
00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:18.109
Move your feet, George.

195
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.614
You keep standing there like a statue
and a pigeon is gonna crap on you.

196
00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:29.913
Get up.

197
00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:34.877
Get out of that ring. Get out that ring.
Ain't no reason to be in that ring.

198
00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:39.090
Attaboy, Royce!

199
00:21:50.601 --> 00:21:53.479
He was lucky! That's all he was.

200
00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.117
Listen, son.
I know that's not what you were...

201
00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:08.660
I'm not your son.

202
00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:09.995
That's a good thing too.

203
00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:12.205
I wouldn't want
no son of mine calling it luck,

204
00:22:12.206 --> 00:22:13.915
when he got whupped fair and square.

205
00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:16.710
They all laughing at me because of you.

206
00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:18.837
What do you care about what they think?

207
00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.299
Six months ago,
Royce didn't know any more than you do.

208
00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:23.134
I taught him.

209
00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:25.761
I can teach you too.

210
00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:33.310
You got a punch, I'll tell you that.

211
00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:34.896
But that's just about all you got.

212
00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:37.856
There you go.

213
00:22:40.902 --> 00:22:42.486
We gotta get you a jab.

214
00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:50.286
We gotta get you some footwork.

215
00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:53.039
We're gonna start out with a punch.

216
00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:56.209
All right? Throw a punch.

217
00:23:00.254 --> 00:23:02.089
Now throw the other one.

218
00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:13.600
See what I just did there?

219
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:16.896
The mind controls the body,
not the other way around.

220
00:23:17.939 --> 00:23:21.192
In every battle,
the greatest foe that we will combat...

221
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.237
is in here.

222
00:23:25.488 --> 00:23:28.323
You were making fun of Royce
when he was dancing around, wasn't you?

223
00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:30.326
- He was showing off.
- No, he wasn't.

224
00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:33.328
He was trying to force you to go
where he needed you to go,

225
00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:35.873
so he could deliver that punch
that he was setting up.

226
00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:41.045
And he was studying the ring too,
the soft spots, the loose boards.

227
00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:45.132
Not just about punching, George.
It's about thinking.

228
00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:49.679
All right.
Step forward with that left foot.

229
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.765
Now slide that right foot.

230
00:23:53.808 --> 00:23:55.935
Not straight ahead, off to the side.

231
00:23:56.894 --> 00:23:57.894
Put it back.

232
00:23:59.522 --> 00:24:02.275
Here we go. Step forward.

233
00:24:03.568 --> 00:24:04.568
Step back.

234
00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:07.071
Step left.

235
00:24:07.989 --> 00:24:09.198
Step right.

236
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.451
Cut me off. I'm cutting you off.

237
00:24:13.786 --> 00:24:14.787
Cut me off, cut me off.

238
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.039
Good.

239
00:24:43.274 --> 00:24:44.275
Come on.

240
00:24:45.026 --> 00:24:46.944
Come on. Come on.

241
00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:56.953
- Oh, I've seen a woman.
- A woman?

242
00:24:56.954 --> 00:24:59.664
George! Mary, get your brothers in here.

243
00:24:59.665 --> 00:25:01.958
Sonny, Roy, George is on the phone.

244
00:25:01.959 --> 00:25:04.712
- Is that my brother?
- No, no. That's our brother, boy.

245
00:25:05.296 --> 00:25:06.881
Yes, everybody's here.

246
00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:08.590
- Hey, George.
- Hey there.

247
00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:10.426
- We miss you.
- Hi.

248
00:25:13.221 --> 00:25:16.097
- Well, how are you?
- Setting the world on fire.

249
00:25:16.098 --> 00:25:18.141
They raised me 25 cents an hour at work.

250
00:25:18.142 --> 00:25:20.185
Oh, far out.

251
00:25:20.186 --> 00:25:21.937
Out? Out where?

252
00:25:21.938 --> 00:25:25.106
Oh, no. That's just something
they say out here in California.

253
00:25:25.107 --> 00:25:27.026
You can't come back to Texas
talking like that.

254
00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:34.908
- I'm going to the gym a lot.
- Basketball?

255
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:38.161
<i>No, no. I found something better.</i>

256
00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:40.163
I'm learning how to box.

257
00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:42.415
Please don't tell me
you're fighting again.

258
00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:45.252
- No, I'm not fighting.
- Then what do you call it, George?

259
00:25:45.253 --> 00:25:48.213
It's boxing. It's a sport with rules.

260
00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:49.506
And I'm good at it.

261
00:25:49.507 --> 00:25:51.800
God knows I don't want you to be fighting.

262
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:54.344
God? What's God got to do
with anything, Mama?

263
00:25:54.345 --> 00:25:56.263
Don't tell me you gone so far from home,

264
00:25:56.264 --> 00:25:58.431
you don't know
what God's gotta do with your life.

265
00:25:58.432 --> 00:26:01.184
- Mama, I'm just trying... Mama?
<i>- Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

266
00:26:01.185 --> 00:26:02.185
Mama?

267
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.647
- George?
<i>- Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

268
00:26:05.523 --> 00:26:08.860
<i>Please deposit 10 cents
for the next minute.</i>

269
00:26:09.902 --> 00:26:12.071
<i>Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

270
00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:22.914
Come on, Royce, put him down.

271
00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:25.333
All right, George. You got this.

272
00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:26.334
Time!

273
00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:32.675
Come on, cut him off! Cut him off!

274
00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:48.357
Oh, yeah!

275
00:26:50.818 --> 00:26:52.320
That's my bunkmate.

276
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.664
I may be a little late tonight.

277
00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:05.958
I know I promised.

278
00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:07.793
I will try.

279
00:27:13.382 --> 00:27:15.927
My wife thinks
I give up too much time to this place.

280
00:27:17.136 --> 00:27:19.555
- You boxed?
- I went professional.

281
00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:22.350
Won my first 24 fights.

282
00:27:23.184 --> 00:27:24.184
And then what?

283
00:27:24.185 --> 00:27:27.730
Unfortunately,
I had to trade one uniform for another.

284
00:27:28.272 --> 00:27:32.067
Hey, I see you're reading the <i>Boxing News.</i>

285
00:27:32.068 --> 00:27:34.277
- Yeah.
- You an aficionado now?

286
00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:36.488
- I was looking at Joe Frazier.
- Yeah?

287
00:27:36.489 --> 00:27:37.990
He's real good.

288
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.744
Yeah, I wouldn't mind all this
that he's got.

289
00:27:46.582 --> 00:27:48.709
I wanna be
the heavyweight champion of the world.

290
00:27:51.254 --> 00:27:53.296
Slow down, George. Slow down.

291
00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:55.590
I can't slow down. I gotta speed up.

292
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:58.969
- You said you can get me some fights.
- I can, and I will.

293
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:59.971
Okay.

294
00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:03.056
But first, you gotta win some tournaments.

295
00:28:03.057 --> 00:28:06.142
Then we can take aim at the Golden Gloves.

296
00:28:06.143 --> 00:28:09.437
And after that,
we can set our sights on the Olympics.

297
00:28:09.438 --> 00:28:10.731
Well, when are they?

298
00:28:11.566 --> 00:28:13.483
Next summer, Mexico City.

299
00:28:13.484 --> 00:28:16.444
But we're gonna wait
for the one after that.

300
00:28:16.445 --> 00:28:19.573
That gives you five years
to train and develop.

301
00:28:19.574 --> 00:28:21.241
Five years?

302
00:28:21.242 --> 00:28:22.951
I'll be a old man.

303
00:28:22.952 --> 00:28:24.286
Listen to me, George.

304
00:28:24.287 --> 00:28:26.830
You got a punch like I've never seen.

305
00:28:26.831 --> 00:28:30.333
But even if you trained harder
than any man has ever trained,

306
00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:34.380
there is no way that you can make it
to the Olympics next year.

307
00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:44.097
<i>The Russians are dominating here
at the Olympics in Mexico City,</i>

308
00:28:44.098 --> 00:28:46.559
<i>three gold medals
to just one for the U.S. team.</i>

309
00:28:47.894 --> 00:28:50.228
<i>The Russians have saved
their best for last.</i>

310
00:28:50.229 --> 00:28:53.691
<i>The legendary Jonas Čepulis
has won 203 fights.</i>

311
00:28:54.317 --> 00:28:55.318
Come on, George.

312
00:28:57.361 --> 00:29:00.071
<i>America's final hope,
19-year-old George Foreman,</i>

313
00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:02.366
<i>has been fighting for only one year.</i>

314
00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:05.994
<i>He would seem to have no chance
at winning gold.</i>

315
00:29:05.995 --> 00:29:07.371
Come on.

316
00:29:07.997 --> 00:29:11.584
<i>I don't think anyone has ever seen
a bigger mismatch in the Olympic ring.</i>

317
00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:15.338
<i>What Foreman's being asked
to do today is impossible.</i>

318
00:29:16.589 --> 00:29:20.383
<i>The big Russian's setting the tone early,
giving the young rookie a boxing lesson.</i>

319
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:22.053
Come on, wake up.

320
00:29:24.013 --> 00:29:25.348
Hit him now. Get him now.

321
00:29:28.267 --> 00:29:29.393
Wake up.

322
00:29:35.733 --> 00:29:37.318
<i>Big left hand from George Foreman.</i>

323
00:29:37.944 --> 00:29:38.944
You see that?

324
00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.782
Yeah! Yes!

325
00:29:43.783 --> 00:29:47.078
<i>The Fighting Corpsman is turning
the tables on Čepulis.</i>

326
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:51.122
<i>Foreman pouring it on now, landing bombs.</i>

327
00:29:51.123 --> 00:29:53.668
<i>Čepulis looks like
he's in really bad shape.</i>

328
00:30:01.884 --> 00:30:04.762
- Stop, stop! That's it!
<i>- The ref has stopped the fight!</i>

329
00:30:06.097 --> 00:30:09.851
<i>Nineteen-year-old George Foreman has
won the gold medal in a stunning upset.</i>

330
00:30:12.645 --> 00:30:13.687
Yeah!

331
00:30:13.688 --> 00:30:16.107
- He won the gold medal.
- Look at him.

332
00:30:19.193 --> 00:30:20.319
God help him.

333
00:30:29.537 --> 00:30:37.537
<i>Foreman! Foreman! Foreman!</i>

334
00:31:08.034 --> 00:31:10.369
- Hey, George.
- Hey, what's going on, brother?

335
00:31:14.624 --> 00:31:15.624
Hey, Tuck.

336
00:31:17.168 --> 00:31:20.253
- Hey, brother. What's going on?
- What's up, George?

337
00:31:20.254 --> 00:31:21.254
Hey.

338
00:31:24.008 --> 00:31:25.884
You can go ahead and touch it, man.

339
00:31:25.885 --> 00:31:27.220
It's heavy though.

340
00:31:28.012 --> 00:31:30.431
Yeah, I bet it's heavy, all right.

341
00:31:32.058 --> 00:31:33.684
What's that 'posed to mean?

342
00:31:34.435 --> 00:31:39.524
Man, I don't see how you can hold
that American flag all up high like you do

343
00:31:40.024 --> 00:31:42.693
when our brothers, shoot, our brothers,

344
00:31:43.402 --> 00:31:46.405
they was doing their thing over there.

345
00:31:52.703 --> 00:31:55.205
They was standing up for all us back here.

346
00:31:55.206 --> 00:31:56.748
And what were you doing?

347
00:31:56.749 --> 00:31:59.585
Standing up for a country
that don't love you back.

348
00:32:00.711 --> 00:32:01.754
That's heavy.

349
00:32:16.394 --> 00:32:17.978
You gotta let this go.

350
00:32:17.979 --> 00:32:21.189
If anybody ever talk to me
about that flag again,

351
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.191
they not gonna get away with it.

352
00:32:23.192 --> 00:32:25.111
They acting like I'm some kind of sellout.

353
00:32:26.529 --> 00:32:28.822
Let me make you something to eat.
Anything you want.

354
00:32:28.823 --> 00:32:29.907
I'm not hungry.

355
00:32:30.992 --> 00:32:34.954
Let the Lord take me now.
I never thought I'd hear that from you.

356
00:32:48.301 --> 00:32:50.927
You left here with nothing to your name,

357
00:32:50.928 --> 00:32:52.972
and you came back with gold.

358
00:32:53.598 --> 00:32:56.184
Then how come
all anybody wanna talk about is the flag?

359
00:32:57.977 --> 00:32:59.436
You know what I'm gonna do?

360
00:32:59.437 --> 00:33:02.147
I'm gonna win the championship belt.

361
00:33:02.148 --> 00:33:05.318
- And they'll respect me then.
- You gonna keep fighting?

362
00:33:06.652 --> 00:33:07.903
You gonna get hurt.

363
00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:10.698
Didn't you watch me? They don't hurt me.

364
00:33:11.407 --> 00:33:12.532
I hurt them.

365
00:33:12.533 --> 00:33:16.120
And that's all you wanna do
with your life, hurt people?

366
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:20.457
You are better than this.

367
00:33:20.458 --> 00:33:21.792
I got a plan, Mama.

368
00:33:22.752 --> 00:33:24.670
And I need you to believe in it.

369
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.172
I heard he's not so bad.

370
00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:13.344
Right on.

371
00:34:14.428 --> 00:34:15.471
And you are?

372
00:34:16.347 --> 00:34:19.724
- Paula.
<i>- Last call for Flight 275 to Los Angeles.</i>

373
00:34:19.725 --> 00:34:22.227
That's me. Nice meeting you, George.

374
00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:24.230
Wait. Oh, that's not fair.

375
00:34:25.231 --> 00:34:28.024
- You live here in Oakland?
- Yes, I do.

376
00:34:28.025 --> 00:34:30.026
So that means you'll be coming back.

377
00:34:30.027 --> 00:34:31.820
Yeah, I'm moving here.

378
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:34.949
I'm gonna be training,
but when I'm not, you know,

379
00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.242
I could go outside sometimes.

380
00:34:37.243 --> 00:34:39.829
Your footwork is better
than your pickup game, George.

381
00:34:40.788 --> 00:34:42.580
Yeah, I can't argue that.

382
00:34:42.581 --> 00:34:45.877
Tell me something about yourself. Anything.

383
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:48.670
- Anything?
- Yeah.

384
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.719
I can type a hundred words a minute.

385
00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:58.097
I can't even talk that fast.

386
00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:06.689
Can I see you again?

387
00:35:12.195 --> 00:35:14.238
Go ahead and write your phone number down.

388
00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:19.201
I'm the one 'posed to be asking for yours.

389
00:35:19.202 --> 00:35:22.330
George, do I look like the kind of woman
that stands around by the phone?

390
00:35:39.055 --> 00:35:41.515
No, ma'am. You do not.

391
00:35:41.516 --> 00:35:44.559
Well, hold on.
Are you sure we need these guys?

392
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.394
Pro game's a racket.

393
00:35:46.395 --> 00:35:48.356
These guys could take us
where we need to go.

394
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:58.616
<i>I'm smelling me some new blood, new blood</i>

395
00:36:00.368 --> 00:36:02.536
Hey. Dick Sadler.

396
00:36:02.537 --> 00:36:04.664
He gonna be your trainer
and your promoter.

397
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:06.998
This is Archie Moore,

398
00:36:06.999 --> 00:36:09.668
the former light-heavyweight champion
of the world.

399
00:36:09.669 --> 00:36:11.753
He gonna teach you everything
that he done learned.

400
00:36:11.754 --> 00:36:13.965
If I like what I see.

401
00:36:18.928 --> 00:36:20.513
Hey, Sonny. I'm such a big fan.

402
00:36:21.722 --> 00:36:22.890
Can I get your autograph?

403
00:36:24.183 --> 00:36:25.725
- Hey, that's...
- Yeah, it's...

404
00:36:25.726 --> 00:36:26.978
Sonny Liston.

405
00:36:27.478 --> 00:36:29.647
We make champions around here, son.

406
00:36:30.439 --> 00:36:33.776
What you're setting out to do
is beyond your imagination.

407
00:36:35.778 --> 00:36:38.280
The morning you wake up
to fight for that championship,

408
00:36:38.281 --> 00:36:41.575
the air taste different,
the sun look different.

409
00:36:41.576 --> 00:36:45.245
Only two men on this whole earth matter
and you're one of them.

410
00:36:45.246 --> 00:36:48.623
The other, if you make it that far,

411
00:36:48.624 --> 00:36:50.084
is Joe Frazier.

412
00:37:09.145 --> 00:37:12.315
We gonna name this bag Joe Frazier.

413
00:37:13.482 --> 00:37:16.651
If you hit him in the solar plexus,
you gonna cut off his breathing.

414
00:37:16.652 --> 00:37:19.654
You hit him in the chin,
you gonna rattle his nerves.

415
00:37:19.655 --> 00:37:22.407
You hit him in the heart,
you gonna make his heartbeat skip.

416
00:37:22.408 --> 00:37:24.410
Every punch, George, power!

417
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.164
<i>- Hello?</i>
- First ring.

418
00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:30.707
- Paula!
- Yes.

419
00:37:30.708 --> 00:37:33.268
I wanna hear the rest of that story
you were starting to tell me.

420
00:37:33.794 --> 00:37:35.003
What story?

421
00:37:35.004 --> 00:37:38.007
About how you can type 100 words a minute.

422
00:37:40.718 --> 00:37:42.010
That story.

423
00:37:42.011 --> 00:37:46.223
George, when are you gonna
ask me a real question?

424
00:37:46.224 --> 00:37:47.350
Like what?

425
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.227
Like...

426
00:37:50.019 --> 00:37:51.687
if I wanna go out on a date.

427
00:37:54.649 --> 00:37:56.067
Pound him, George. Pound him!

428
00:38:04.784 --> 00:38:06.868
You sure you typing real words?

429
00:38:06.869 --> 00:38:08.871
Yeah, that sound like music.

430
00:38:25.137 --> 00:38:27.472
- Knock him out, baby!
- All right, all right.

431
00:38:27.473 --> 00:38:29.016
Keep him there. Keep him there.

432
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:31.309
Move him, man.

433
00:38:35.523 --> 00:38:37.358
- That's it!
- Yes!

434
00:38:42.864 --> 00:38:45.115
The winner by TKO,

435
00:38:45.116 --> 00:38:48.911
still undefeated, George Foreman!

436
00:38:51.914 --> 00:38:54.207
Do you take this woman to be your wife?

437
00:38:54.208 --> 00:38:55.293
You bet I do.

438
00:39:01.215 --> 00:39:02.592
You may kiss the bride.

439
00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:12.059
Hey, watch this.

440
00:39:26.699 --> 00:39:29.368
- I think you ready.
- Nice punching, big fella.

441
00:39:31.662 --> 00:39:33.623
Frazier won't know what hit him.

442
00:39:34.874 --> 00:39:38.585
<i>Here we are
for the heavyweight championship fight</i>

443
00:39:38.586 --> 00:39:42.423
<i>between Joe Frazier and George Foreman.</i>

444
00:39:43.758 --> 00:39:46.718
<i>Joe Frazier is the heavy favorite tonight.</i>

445
00:39:46.719 --> 00:39:50.555
His best weapon, the left hook, is deadly.

446
00:39:50.556 --> 00:39:53.892
Put Ali on the canvas two years ago,

447
00:39:53.893 --> 00:39:58.188
and if Foreman isn't aware of it,
it could put him on his back,

448
00:39:58.189 --> 00:40:02.150
and maybe even carried
out of the arena on a stretcher.

449
00:40:02.151 --> 00:40:10.151
<i>Frazier! Frazier! Frazier!</i>

450
00:40:16.374 --> 00:40:19.459
This contest is for
the heavyweight championship of the world.

451
00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.128
It's governed
by the Jamaican Board of Control...

452
00:40:22.129 --> 00:40:24.799
Nobody giving you a chance to win tonight.

453
00:40:26.717 --> 00:40:27.802
<i>That's good.</i>

454
00:40:31.889 --> 00:40:34.392
<i>But Smokin' Joe ain't like
the others, nah.</i>

455
00:40:35.393 --> 00:40:37.061
He the real deal.

456
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.524
Remember, only two men
on this whole earth matter.

457
00:40:42.567 --> 00:40:43.693
Now go get him.

458
00:40:46.112 --> 00:40:47.363
<i>You're ready, George.</i>

459
00:40:48.739 --> 00:40:51.617
<i>Now, Joe,
he's expecting that you're just a man.</i>

460
00:40:52.785 --> 00:40:55.663
<i>But tonight, you're a beast.</i>

461
00:40:56.956 --> 00:40:58.165
Let him out.

462
00:41:00.126 --> 00:41:02.085
And there's the bell. They're underway.

463
00:41:02.086 --> 00:41:04.630
Oh, big swing and a miss from George.

464
00:41:08.176 --> 00:41:10.260
There's that Joe Frazier left hook.

465
00:41:10.261 --> 00:41:12.762
One more of those could end it.

466
00:41:12.763 --> 00:41:15.391
Stay on him. Watch out for that.
Watch out for that.

467
00:41:19.687 --> 00:41:21.272
Big shot by Foreman.

468
00:41:26.277 --> 00:41:27.861
Oh, and another left hook!

469
00:41:27.862 --> 00:41:29.739
How is he still standing?

470
00:41:31.449 --> 00:41:32.700
There it is.

471
00:41:34.535 --> 00:41:37.788
Frazier's taking some damage.
A real surprise.

472
00:41:38.456 --> 00:41:39.707
That's it. That's it!

473
00:41:43.085 --> 00:41:46.421
Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!

474
00:41:46.422 --> 00:41:48.132
Down goes Frazier!

475
00:41:52.303 --> 00:41:53.763
Joe is slow to get up.

476
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.642
And George Foreman is standing
as poised as can be.

477
00:41:58.643 --> 00:42:02.230
The heavyweight champ
is taking the eight count.

478
00:42:03.898 --> 00:42:05.942
There's the bell for the second round.

479
00:42:07.735 --> 00:42:10.238
But Joe is tough. Joe is game.

480
00:42:11.489 --> 00:42:16.452
And Foreman is all over him again,
just hitting him again and again.

481
00:42:21.332 --> 00:42:22.791
He's down again!

482
00:42:22.792 --> 00:42:24.460
This is hard to believe.

483
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.087
Get off the ropes!

484
00:42:27.088 --> 00:42:30.466
Six, seven, eight.

485
00:42:35.012 --> 00:42:37.597
He's target practice for George Foreman.

486
00:42:37.598 --> 00:42:39.725
Target practice!

487
00:42:40.351 --> 00:42:43.563
- Don't let up.
- How much more can Frazier take?

488
00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:55.448
He's down! He's down again!

489
00:42:55.449 --> 00:42:56.867
And it's over!

490
00:42:56.868 --> 00:42:58.869
It's over! So long!

491
00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:01.205
I've never seen anything like this.

492
00:43:02.415 --> 00:43:07.044
George Foreman is the new
heavyweight champion of the world.

493
00:43:16.387 --> 00:43:19.265
All right.

494
00:43:20.099 --> 00:43:21.100
Yes.

495
00:43:38.659 --> 00:43:40.076
How does it feel to be a winner?

496
00:43:40.077 --> 00:43:42.329
I was determined
to become a winner tonight.

497
00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:44.414
I'd like to thank the press
all over the country

498
00:43:44.415 --> 00:43:46.291
for writing beautiful things about me.

499
00:43:46.292 --> 00:43:49.295
The press has kept my name
in the paper. And...

500
00:43:50.171 --> 00:43:52.464
And it kept me focused.

501
00:43:52.465 --> 00:43:55.967
So, what's the first thing
you'll do as a champion, George?

502
00:43:55.968 --> 00:43:58.346
I'm gonna buy my mama a big house.

503
00:44:01.182 --> 00:44:04.142
Wait a second. Wait... What is this?

504
00:44:04.143 --> 00:44:07.146
Is that the champ? Is that the champ?

505
00:44:08.481 --> 00:44:11.275
Do you have any idea
what's coming next, George?

506
00:44:12.151 --> 00:44:13.860
A flood of money.

507
00:44:13.861 --> 00:44:16.072
Well, I'm always ready for money.

508
00:44:16.906 --> 00:44:18.241
But my moneyman ain't.

509
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.328
You want me to be your moneyman?

510
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:24.747
Yeah, I do.

511
00:44:25.873 --> 00:44:27.124
But, Des, man...

512
00:44:28.084 --> 00:44:31.003
I'm gonna need you sharp from now on.

513
00:44:39.262 --> 00:44:41.097
That's what I'm talking about.

514
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.351
It's a long way from the Job Corps.

515
00:45:16.007 --> 00:45:17.592
How'd you get up here?

516
00:45:25.683 --> 00:45:27.310
You don't want me to stay?

517
00:46:07.099 --> 00:46:10.644
<i>Muhammad, there are a lot of people saying</i>

518
00:46:10.645 --> 00:46:13.396
<i>they've never seen as formidable a puncher</i>

519
00:46:13.397 --> 00:46:16.942
<i>as the new champ,
young George Foreman.</i>

520
00:46:16.943 --> 00:46:18.735
<i>Howard, when I think of George Foreman,</i>

521
00:46:18.736 --> 00:46:22.280
<i>I think of the establishment,
the flag-waver.</i>

522
00:46:22.281 --> 00:46:24.115
<i>And I got a new punch for George, Howard,</i>

523
00:46:24.116 --> 00:46:26.409
<i>and I call it the "Ghetto Whopper."</i>

524
00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:28.578
<i>And the reason I call it
the Ghetto Whopper</i>

525
00:46:28.579 --> 00:46:32.667
<i>is because it's thrown in the ghetto
at 3 o'clock in the morning.</i>

526
00:46:33.334 --> 00:46:34.793
<i>You ever seen one of them punches?</i>

527
00:46:34.794 --> 00:46:37.045
<i>Comes out of nowhere,
hits you like a bottle in the head.</i>

528
00:46:37.046 --> 00:46:39.965
<i>Think you'd have to wait
till 3:00 in the morning</i>

529
00:46:39.966 --> 00:46:41.508
<i>to fight George Foreman?</i>

530
00:46:41.509 --> 00:46:43.093
<i>Howard, let it be known.</i>

531
00:46:43.094 --> 00:46:46.514
<i>I will fight George Foreman
anywhere, any time.</i>

532
00:46:50.184 --> 00:46:52.936
- What y'all think? Nice, isn't it?
- Oh, my Lord.

533
00:46:52.937 --> 00:46:55.898
Now, come on.
I wanna show y'all something.

534
00:46:57.316 --> 00:46:58.317
Y'all hear that?

535
00:46:59.068 --> 00:47:01.529
Now, each car has its own personality.

536
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.781
That's why you need five of them?

537
00:47:04.532 --> 00:47:07.618
Five? Wait till you see my garage.

538
00:47:08.202 --> 00:47:10.704
Oh, my Lord.
You've lost your doggone mind.

539
00:47:10.705 --> 00:47:12.373
I wanna show y'all something else.

540
00:47:12.957 --> 00:47:15.167
- All right. You got that other one there?
- Yes, sir.

541
00:47:15.168 --> 00:47:16.168
Okay.

542
00:47:17.295 --> 00:47:18.837
Been on a grill all day for y'all.

543
00:47:18.838 --> 00:47:22.299
My own barbecue sauce.
I took my time on it.

544
00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.052
- Okay. That's what I'm talking about.
- Working on this all day.

545
00:47:25.761 --> 00:47:27.387
- Okay
- That looks fantastic.

546
00:47:27.388 --> 00:47:28.848
There she is.

547
00:47:29.932 --> 00:47:32.351
- Give me my birthday baby.
- Your daddy wants you.

548
00:47:33.728 --> 00:47:34.896
- Yeah.
- Go to Daddy.

549
00:47:36.272 --> 00:47:37.273
Yeah.

550
00:47:38.649 --> 00:47:41.277
- Happy birthday.
- How about one for your wife too?

551
00:47:44.655 --> 00:47:47.449
All right. Say hi to everybody.

552
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:48.950
Say hi to everybody.

553
00:47:48.951 --> 00:47:51.328
- Happy birthday, beautiful.
- I'm gonna give you away.

554
00:47:51.329 --> 00:47:52.729
- Don't give her away.
- I love you.

555
00:47:54.999 --> 00:47:56.417
- All right.
- Bye.

556
00:47:57.627 --> 00:47:59.669
- It's time to eat now.
- Boy.

557
00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:02.923
- You know better.
- Let's thank God for the food first.

558
00:48:02.924 --> 00:48:04.008
God?

559
00:48:05.051 --> 00:48:06.801
I bought the food, Mama.

560
00:48:06.802 --> 00:48:09.180
- Not God.
- Good.

561
00:48:09.805 --> 00:48:11.057
Then you say grace.

562
00:48:14.185 --> 00:48:15.770
I like the way you say it, Mama.

563
00:48:17.688 --> 00:48:20.233
Me and Charles have something
we wanna tell y'all.

564
00:48:22.485 --> 00:48:24.529
- We're having a baby.
- A baby?

565
00:48:25.196 --> 00:48:28.031
Charles, you old dog.
Getting my sister pregnant.

566
00:48:28.032 --> 00:48:30.742
- Look at that.
- Mary, congratulations.

567
00:48:30.743 --> 00:48:32.453
- Thank you.
- It's great.

568
00:48:34.455 --> 00:48:36.736
We'll have me another niece
or nephew running around here.

569
00:48:39.794 --> 00:48:40.794
Hello?

570
00:48:44.507 --> 00:48:46.217
Stop calling this house.

571
00:48:50.388 --> 00:48:52.556
- So, Des...
- Yes, sir.

572
00:48:52.557 --> 00:48:53.974
How's my money doing?

573
00:48:53.975 --> 00:48:58.228
I'm pouring everything
into rock-solid stocks.

574
00:48:58.229 --> 00:48:59.896
I like the sound of that.

575
00:48:59.897 --> 00:49:01.732
"Rock-solid stocks."

576
00:49:04.402 --> 00:49:07.988
You know, Ali sure been talking
a whole bunch of mess on TV,

577
00:49:07.989 --> 00:49:10.157
bragging about which round
he'll knock you out in.

578
00:49:12.743 --> 00:49:14.202
Talk is cheap.

579
00:49:14.203 --> 00:49:17.622
You know what they say about pretty boys
back in the Fifth Wards.

580
00:49:17.623 --> 00:49:19.332
They can't take a punch.

581
00:49:19.333 --> 00:49:20.418
Yes.

582
00:49:32.513 --> 00:49:34.764
I think everybody's ready for dessert.

583
00:49:34.765 --> 00:49:36.266
You should tell me their names,

584
00:49:36.267 --> 00:49:39.270
so I don't have to stand there
holding the phone like a fool.

585
00:49:40.396 --> 00:49:41.563
What are you talking about?

586
00:49:41.564 --> 00:49:43.024
Did you think I didn't know?

587
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:48.487
- I don't have time for this.
- No, it's me you don't have time for.

588
00:49:53.743 --> 00:49:58.122
How many have there been, George?

589
00:50:02.627 --> 00:50:04.836
You can't even look me in the eye anymore.

590
00:50:04.837 --> 00:50:08.215
Woman, I got a $5 million fight
coming up against Ali.

591
00:50:08.216 --> 00:50:11.594
You think I dropped my life for you,
so that I could play seconds?

592
00:50:13.179 --> 00:50:15.180
I was doing just fine
before you came along.

593
00:50:15.181 --> 00:50:17.475
So you don't like this life now, huh?

594
00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:19.893
I give you everything.

595
00:50:19.894 --> 00:50:21.687
I don't want everything.

596
00:50:27.401 --> 00:50:28.569
I want you.

597
00:50:30.404 --> 00:50:31.489
You have me.

598
00:50:34.408 --> 00:50:35.493
Look at me.

599
00:50:46.629 --> 00:50:47.797
Look at me.

600
00:51:00.434 --> 00:51:01.727
Just like I thought.

601
00:51:44.812 --> 00:51:46.230
Sir. No, no.

602
00:51:46.814 --> 00:51:47.940
- I got it.
- Okay.

603
00:51:57.366 --> 00:51:58.450
Come on, now.

604
00:51:58.451 --> 00:52:00.911
We gonna float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

605
00:52:00.912 --> 00:52:03.705
His hands can't hit
what his eyes can't see.

606
00:52:03.706 --> 00:52:05.290
Now you see me. Now you don't.

607
00:52:05.291 --> 00:52:07.502
George thinks he will,
but I know he won't.

608
00:52:08.377 --> 00:52:09.920
Ain't that right, Bundini?

609
00:52:09.921 --> 00:52:13.173
Him hitting Joe Frazier
with these big, long punches.

610
00:52:13.174 --> 00:52:14.842
Boxes like a mummy.

611
00:52:15.927 --> 00:52:19.680
"Come here. Where'd you get?
Oh, you over here."

612
00:52:20.431 --> 00:52:23.058
All of you sportswriters,
all of you suckers,

613
00:52:23.059 --> 00:52:25.519
are gonna regret
making me the underdog.

614
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.103
How you gonna make me the underdog?

615
00:52:27.104 --> 00:52:29.481
Talking about George Foreman
is the new champ.

616
00:52:29.482 --> 00:52:32.693
George Foreman ain't no new champ.
He is the new chump.

617
00:52:33.486 --> 00:52:36.404
And he's holding the belt
that was wrongfully taken from me.

618
00:52:36.405 --> 00:52:38.698
And he can't box. He moves like this.

619
00:52:38.699 --> 00:52:40.785
This how he box. Box like a mummy.

620
00:52:41.702 --> 00:52:43.371
"Coming here for you. I'm... "

621
00:52:45.998 --> 00:52:46.999
George.

622
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.919
We was just talking
about a different fighter.

623
00:52:53.673 --> 00:52:55.632
Your turn, Big George.

624
00:52:55.633 --> 00:52:57.677
Why don't you give us
your side of things, huh?

625
00:53:20.032 --> 00:53:24.161
Well, if he boxes how he does interviews,
this gonna be a short night.

626
00:53:25.162 --> 00:53:26.538
Real short night.

627
00:53:26.539 --> 00:53:29.625
We gonna get it on
because we don't get along.

628
00:53:30.418 --> 00:53:32.295
I feel sorry for Ali.

629
00:53:33.087 --> 00:53:34.797
Foreman could put him in the morgue.

630
00:53:49.979 --> 00:53:51.314
"Ali, kill him."

631
00:53:52.607 --> 00:53:54.192
That's what they want?

632
00:54:00.489 --> 00:54:01.490
Foreman...

633
00:54:24.305 --> 00:54:25.680
Rush him like a tiger.

634
00:54:25.681 --> 00:54:27.057
Shut him up for good.

635
00:54:27.058 --> 00:54:29.559
Ali has shocked the world before,

636
00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:33.563
but most of us don't expect him
to get past the middle rounds.

637
00:54:33.564 --> 00:54:36.983
Well, Frank,
Ali is certainly the big underdog.

638
00:54:36.984 --> 00:54:41.112
But he and the country have adopted
the phrase, "Ali, <i>bomaye."</i>

639
00:54:41.113 --> 00:54:42.322
"Ali, kill him."

640
00:54:42.323 --> 00:54:43.823
At 32 years of age,

641
00:54:43.824 --> 00:54:46.826
can Muhammad Ali dance
and stay away from Foreman?

642
00:54:46.827 --> 00:54:48.995
After what Foreman did to Frazier,

643
00:54:48.996 --> 00:54:51.958
Ali would seem to have no chance.

644
00:54:53.459 --> 00:54:55.544
All questions will be answered.

645
00:54:55.545 --> 00:54:58.088
Come on, baby. Come on, George.

646
00:54:58.089 --> 00:54:59.882
- You got this, George.
- Dance with him.

647
00:55:03.511 --> 00:55:05.929
- Get in there.
- Rush him, George. Rush him.

648
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.515
- Right hook.
- Rush him.

649
00:55:10.852 --> 00:55:11.978
There you go.

650
00:55:12.645 --> 00:55:13.979
Punch him in the head.

651
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.648
Let him go. Break. Break.

652
00:55:18.484 --> 00:55:20.027
Come on, George. Come on.

653
00:55:21.487 --> 00:55:22.905
Hands up. Yeah!

654
00:55:28.536 --> 00:55:30.663
That's all you got, George? Come on.

655
00:55:36.878 --> 00:55:38.003
Keep pounding.

656
00:55:38.004 --> 00:55:39.255
He can't last.

657
00:55:40.298 --> 00:55:41.424
Keep on pounding.

658
00:55:47.972 --> 00:55:49.390
That's right, champ.

659
00:55:52.602 --> 00:55:54.644
Ali retreating to the ropes,

660
00:55:54.645 --> 00:55:57.105
looking for a place to hide
from Foreman's power.

661
00:55:57.106 --> 00:55:58.065
That's all you got?

662
00:55:58.066 --> 00:56:01.152
I don't see any place to hide
in that ring.

663
00:56:01.903 --> 00:56:03.738
Ali, get off of those ropes!

664
00:56:05.031 --> 00:56:06.824
Foreman's pouring on the punches.

665
00:56:08.034 --> 00:56:10.243
Those punches gotta be doing some damage.

666
00:56:10.244 --> 00:56:12.662
They told me you was bad, George.
Let me see it.

667
00:56:12.663 --> 00:56:16.209
Ali cannot keep taking them
and expect to survive.

668
00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:17.835
Box.

669
00:56:23.007 --> 00:56:24.299
Come on. Show me something.

670
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.760
Don't play with that sucker.

671
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:29.639
Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

672
00:56:30.973 --> 00:56:32.600
Stay on him, George!

673
00:56:33.601 --> 00:56:35.978
Come on, champ, get off the ropes.
Come on, now.

674
00:56:37.063 --> 00:56:38.189
There it is.

675
00:56:40.775 --> 00:56:41.901
Break it up, ref.

676
00:56:42.652 --> 00:56:45.154
- What's my name?
- There we go. Break it up.

677
00:56:50.618 --> 00:56:53.371
Get off those ropes! Get out of there!

678
00:56:54.288 --> 00:56:56.873
I'm not sure about this strategy
of retreating to the ropes.

679
00:56:56.874 --> 00:56:59.668
I'm going right back to the ropes.
Come and get me.

680
00:56:59.669 --> 00:57:01.878
Come on. Put that pressure on him, George.

681
00:57:01.879 --> 00:57:02.921
He's getting pounded.

682
00:57:02.922 --> 00:57:05.967
Those blows are deadly
from George Foreman.

683
00:57:11.389 --> 00:57:13.641
Come on, George. Let me see something.

684
00:57:19.146 --> 00:57:20.857
Get off of those ropes!

685
00:57:24.026 --> 00:57:26.904
Come on, George.
They told me you could hit hard.

686
00:57:27.446 --> 00:57:28.489
There you go.

687
00:57:38.875 --> 00:57:40.126
That's all you got?

688
00:57:46.674 --> 00:57:50.385
Big right hand from Ali.
That punch staggered Foreman.

689
00:57:50.386 --> 00:57:52.137
They told me you was bad, George.

690
00:57:52.138 --> 00:57:53.847
They told me you was bad.

691
00:57:53.848 --> 00:57:57.935
That one punch definitely changed
the tenor of this fight.

692
00:58:05.193 --> 00:58:08.529
Keep hitting him. Keep pounding him.

693
00:58:23.711 --> 00:58:25.004
I'm gonna end it.

694
00:58:28.758 --> 00:58:29.800
I'm gonna end it.

695
00:58:36.682 --> 00:58:38.643
Get off those ropes, champ. Come on.

696
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.561
That's right.

697
00:59:10.132 --> 00:59:12.425
Foreman's punches just don't have
any juice on them.

698
00:59:12.426 --> 00:59:14.386
Foreman looks tired.

699
00:59:14.387 --> 00:59:15.679
He could be in real trouble.

700
00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:18.808
Maybe this is
what Ali was counting on, Frank.

701
00:59:21.394 --> 00:59:23.437
- Work on him, George!
- Destroy him!

702
00:59:35.241 --> 00:59:36.408
My turn.

703
00:59:36.409 --> 00:59:38.744
Come on. That's right.
Left, right, left. Come on.

704
00:59:39.745 --> 00:59:43.499
Oh, Muhammad Ali
with a massive right hand!

705
00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.003
And another one!

706
01:00:05.605 --> 01:00:09.774
Four, five, six, seven,

707
01:00:09.775 --> 01:00:12.819
eight, nine, ten.

708
01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:15.405
And it's over. It's over!

709
01:00:15.406 --> 01:00:17.699
Ali has done the impossible.

710
01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:20.620
Ali did it! Ali did it again.

711
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:32.381
<i>I lived one way my whole life.</i>

712
01:00:34.926 --> 01:00:35.927
<i>To hurt...</i>

713
01:00:37.303 --> 01:00:38.596
<i>to knock down...</i>

714
01:00:39.889 --> 01:00:40.973
<i>to destroy.</i>

715
01:00:54.278 --> 01:00:56.447
<i>It became all I could see.</i>

716
01:00:59.617 --> 01:01:01.702
<i>I was blind to everything else.</i>

717
01:01:04.622 --> 01:01:06.707
<i>When will I get to see you, Daddy?</i>

718
01:01:08.584 --> 01:01:09.584
Soon.

719
01:01:11.629 --> 01:01:12.630
I promise.

720
01:01:14.799 --> 01:01:18.177
And we will never be apart again. Okay?

721
01:01:20.054 --> 01:01:22.223
<i>George, we gotta go now. It's dinnertime.</i>

722
01:01:23.474 --> 01:01:25.350
<i>My lawyer said
you haven't signed the papers.</i>

723
01:01:25.351 --> 01:01:27.102
I told you I'd get to it.

724
01:01:27.103 --> 01:01:28.521
<i>Get to it soon.</i>

725
01:01:59.552 --> 01:02:00.970
I wanted to come sooner.

726
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:04.974
Why you sitting out in the car?
Why don't you come on inside?

727
01:02:08.561 --> 01:02:10.438
Doc said you fired Dick and Archie.

728
01:02:12.064 --> 01:02:13.064
Yeah.

729
01:02:13.774 --> 01:02:15.610
I lost a fight because of them.

730
01:02:18.196 --> 01:02:19.864
It's like Doc always said...

731
01:02:21.699 --> 01:02:23.951
I should've used my head
instead of my hands.

732
01:02:28.247 --> 01:02:29.665
He laid on the ropes...

733
01:02:30.416 --> 01:02:32.710
and I kept punching till I was tired.

734
01:02:35.463 --> 01:02:36.881
The rope-a-dope.

735
01:02:40.635 --> 01:02:41.928
And I was the dope.

736
01:02:43.387 --> 01:02:45.680
Look, I know you done had a hard time,

737
01:02:45.681 --> 01:02:48.643
but I can't stand
to hear you talking like this.

738
01:02:50.478 --> 01:02:53.271
<i>Foreman has been a dispirited,
lonely man</i>

739
01:02:53.272 --> 01:02:55.607
<i>through all of these six months
that have passed</i>

740
01:02:55.608 --> 01:02:58.401
<i>since Ali knocked him out
in the eighth round.</i>

741
01:02:58.402 --> 01:03:02.239
<i>Today, a boxing exhibition of sorts.</i>

742
01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.909
George Foreman,
former heavyweight champion of the world,

743
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:09.372
will attempt to knock out
five fighters in one day.

744
01:03:10.456 --> 01:03:15.086
Exactly what he hopes to accomplish
by this is anybody's guess.

745
01:03:16.295 --> 01:03:19.006
George, you still got time to back out.

746
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:20.675
You ain't gotta do this.

747
01:03:22.844 --> 01:03:26.263
Heavyweight champion
and world-class clown, Muhammad Ali,

748
01:03:26.264 --> 01:03:27.722
about to join me at the table.

749
01:03:27.723 --> 01:03:30.226
"Clown"? Howard, don't get hurt, now.

750
01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.396
There's the bell. And they're underway.

751
01:03:34.105 --> 01:03:35.939
Not his usual style, Muhammad.

752
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:37.858
Yeah, I think he's trying to impress me.

753
01:03:37.859 --> 01:03:41.570
He's... He's bouncing around
like the Easter Bunny.

754
01:03:41.571 --> 01:03:43.948
Indeed, like a bunny, Muhammad.

755
01:03:45.408 --> 01:03:46.908
What are you doing?

756
01:03:46.909 --> 01:03:48.743
Get on them ropes. There you go.

757
01:03:48.744 --> 01:03:50.538
Stay on the ropes. Get on the ropes.

758
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.706
Ain't no wrestling match, George.

759
01:03:52.707 --> 01:03:54.792
Get on the ropes now. Make him work.

760
01:03:57.503 --> 01:03:59.838
Now Johnson is on the canvas.

761
01:03:59.839 --> 01:04:02.174
- Think that might be it for Alonzo.
- Can't you see he's down?

762
01:04:02.175 --> 01:04:04.259
- Seems to be a scuffle.
- Back off.

763
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.011
Oh, there's a fight breaking out

764
01:04:06.012 --> 01:04:09.097
- between Foreman's trainers and Johnson's.
- Step back!

765
01:04:09.098 --> 01:04:15.979
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

766
01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.399
Crowd is chanting, "Ali! Ali!"

767
01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.402
much to the consternation
of George Foreman.

768
01:04:22.403 --> 01:04:23.779
Ali!

769
01:04:24.488 --> 01:04:25.655
Give me another shot.

770
01:04:25.656 --> 01:04:28.825
I'm not getting back in the ring
with no chump, George.

771
01:04:28.826 --> 01:04:30.827
That's 'cause you're scared of me.

772
01:04:30.828 --> 01:04:32.829
- Scared?
- You scared of me.

773
01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:34.957
Well, let's go right now, George.

774
01:04:35.666 --> 01:04:38.710
- Hold my jacket, Howard. Hold my jacket.
- Come on in the ring.

775
01:04:38.711 --> 01:04:42.547
- Let me go. Hold my jacket.
- Can't fight. You ain't no fighter.

776
01:04:42.548 --> 01:04:44.299
Man can't fight laying on no ropes.

777
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.635
George, I'm too pretty
to fight someone as ugly as you.

778
01:04:46.636 --> 01:04:47.928
Come on in here.

779
01:04:47.929 --> 01:04:51.181
Go ahead, man. Go ahead, George.

780
01:04:51.182 --> 01:04:53.642
- That's what I thought. Always talk.
- I'm telling you.

781
01:04:53.643 --> 01:04:59.941
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

782
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:20.086
What did you think
you were gonna gain out there?

783
01:05:20.753 --> 01:05:21.754
Respect.

784
01:05:22.505 --> 01:05:25.007
Son, the beauty of boxing

785
01:05:25.633 --> 01:05:29.887
is that it shows a man
that can he do something all by himself.

786
01:05:31.389 --> 01:05:32.807
Something constructive.

787
01:05:37.228 --> 01:05:42.233
Let's go back to fighting them
one at a time. What you say?

788
01:05:48.364 --> 01:05:49.532
This just came through.

789
01:05:52.118 --> 01:05:53.118
Okay.

790
01:05:54.036 --> 01:05:55.037
It's for you.

791
01:06:07.717 --> 01:06:09.135
George. George.

792
01:06:10.845 --> 01:06:12.846
- What happened?
- Mary started bleeding.

793
01:06:12.847 --> 01:06:16.266
They're trying to save the baby,
but the air got cut off.

794
01:06:16.267 --> 01:06:18.810
Tell them, whatever it cost,
I'll pay for it.

795
01:06:18.811 --> 01:06:20.103
We need the best doctors.

796
01:06:20.104 --> 01:06:22.564
We already got the best doctors, George.

797
01:06:22.565 --> 01:06:25.484
The baby needs a miracle. We need to pray.

798
01:06:27.862 --> 01:06:28.862
Pray?

799
01:06:36.662 --> 01:06:39.664
Heavenly Father,
we are gathered here humbly,

800
01:06:39.665 --> 01:06:42.043
in the name of your son, Christ Jesus.

801
01:07:12.448 --> 01:07:14.825
All right, here I am.

802
01:07:19.622 --> 01:07:21.707
What did my sister ever do to you?

803
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:26.754
Mary's been sweet and kind
her whole life...

804
01:07:28.297 --> 01:07:29.966
to everybody in this world.

805
01:07:31.384 --> 01:07:32.384
To me,

806
01:07:33.052 --> 01:07:34.554
when I didn't deserve it.

807
01:07:36.222 --> 01:07:38.474
And you gonna take her baby?

808
01:07:39.559 --> 01:07:40.560
Answer me.

809
01:07:41.894 --> 01:07:44.063
Man, all my life
I've been hearing about you.

810
01:07:45.231 --> 01:07:47.441
And you ain't never shown me nothing.

811
01:07:49.443 --> 01:07:50.945
I ain't seen anything.

812
01:07:58.369 --> 01:08:00.204
If you wanna take somebody...

813
01:08:01.956 --> 01:08:02.957
you take me.

814
01:08:06.085 --> 01:08:08.296
You don't take my sister's baby, man.

815
01:08:11.591 --> 01:08:12.592
You take me.

816
01:08:14.635 --> 01:08:15.635
Please.

817
01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:21.850
George.

818
01:08:39.076 --> 01:08:41.746
- Is he...?
- He's perfect.

819
01:08:43.622 --> 01:08:45.666
The doctors can't explain it.

820
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.542
It's a miracle.

821
01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:50.171
That's...

822
01:08:52.298 --> 01:08:54.466
It's good. That's good.

823
01:08:57.970 --> 01:08:59.346
Well, come on over.

824
01:09:00.932 --> 01:09:02.808
Say hi to your nephew.

825
01:09:05.019 --> 01:09:06.229
Little George.

826
01:09:07.647 --> 01:09:08.773
Little George?

827
01:09:09.482 --> 01:09:10.482
Yeah.

828
01:09:14.487 --> 01:09:15.947
Mama told me you prayed.

829
01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:21.202
Whatever you said to him...

830
01:09:23.078 --> 01:09:24.205
it worked.

831
01:09:42.598 --> 01:09:44.516
<i>Jimmy Young! Jimmy Young!</i>

832
01:09:44.517 --> 01:09:49.187
Listen to the crowd.
"Jimmy Young. Jimmy Young."

833
01:09:49.188 --> 01:09:52.648
Foreman hasn't been the same
since he lost to Ali.

834
01:09:52.649 --> 01:09:55.277
- He fired his old team...
- Come on, George.

835
01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:56.571
But it hasn't worked.

836
01:09:58.656 --> 01:10:01.534
George's mind is just not in this fight.

837
01:10:19.969 --> 01:10:21.179
Let's go. All right.

838
01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:31.855
Jimmy Young has won the fight
by unanimous decision.

839
01:10:31.856 --> 01:10:33.566
Promising future for Jimmy...

840
01:10:47.538 --> 01:10:48.956
Keep an eye on him, all right?

841
01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:53.961
What happened out there, George?

842
01:10:54.545 --> 01:10:55.921
Come on, Gil. It's just a fight.

843
01:10:55.922 --> 01:10:57.255
Every boxer has a bad one.

844
01:10:57.256 --> 01:10:59.508
He couldn't afford one.
It was our shot back to Ali.

845
01:10:59.509 --> 01:11:00.843
Man, it's hot.

846
01:11:01.969 --> 01:11:03.429
Why's it so hot in here?

847
01:11:09.894 --> 01:11:10.895
Who said that?

848
01:11:11.771 --> 01:11:13.564
Nobody said nothing, George.

849
01:11:17.235 --> 01:11:18.319
Who said that?

850
01:11:22.156 --> 01:11:24.074
- Who keeps talking?
- Nobody.

851
01:11:24.075 --> 01:11:25.909
Nobody's talking, George.

852
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:27.286
George?

853
01:11:32.834 --> 01:11:33.960
I'm...

854
01:11:36.754 --> 01:11:38.004
I'm fixing...

855
01:11:38.005 --> 01:11:39.507
Whoa, George. George!

856
01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:43.510
He's got a faint pulse.
We need to get him up on the table.

857
01:11:43.511 --> 01:11:44.428
On three.

858
01:11:44.429 --> 01:11:46.848
- One, two, three.
- Careful.

859
01:11:48.099 --> 01:11:51.519
- Easy.
- There you go. On the table. Here we go.

860
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:54.229
All right.

861
01:11:54.647 --> 01:11:55.898
- George?
- George?

862
01:11:56.482 --> 01:11:57.483
George.

863
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:09.161
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

864
01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.206
<i>I believe.</i>

865
01:12:15.042 --> 01:12:16.252
<i>I believe.</i>

866
01:12:20.965 --> 01:12:22.341
- Hey.
- Whoa, easy.

867
01:12:24.218 --> 01:12:25.386
George?

868
01:12:28.639 --> 01:12:30.183
We thought you was dead.

869
01:12:32.393 --> 01:12:33.394
I was.

870
01:12:39.108 --> 01:12:41.152
Jesus Christ is alive in me.

871
01:12:43.487 --> 01:12:44.697
He's alive in me.

872
01:12:45.323 --> 01:12:46.324
He's alive.

873
01:12:46.991 --> 01:12:48.074
I gotta get myself clean.

874
01:12:48.075 --> 01:12:50.327
Don't let him get in the shower.
Cold water will be a shock.

875
01:12:50.328 --> 01:12:52.621
- Wait!
- I gotta get myself clean.

876
01:12:52.622 --> 01:12:53.872
- Wait. No, George.
- Get off.

877
01:12:53.873 --> 01:12:56.541
I gotta get myself clean! Please, please.

878
01:12:56.542 --> 01:12:58.169
Hallelujah!

879
01:13:00.129 --> 01:13:01.422
Hallelujah!

880
01:13:03.674 --> 01:13:04.717
I'm clean.

881
01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:07.512
I'm clean.

882
01:13:10.556 --> 01:13:13.391
I'm clean. I'm clean.

883
01:13:13.392 --> 01:13:15.393
<i>I now baptize you</i>

884
01:13:15.394 --> 01:13:18.230
in the name of the Father,

885
01:13:18.231 --> 01:13:20.233
the son and the holy spirit.

886
01:13:21.067 --> 01:13:22.193
Hallelujah!

887
01:13:23.611 --> 01:13:25.071
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

888
01:13:35.623 --> 01:13:36.916
Hallelujah!

889
01:13:40.169 --> 01:13:43.797
<i>We are bearing witness to a miracle.</i>

890
01:13:43.798 --> 01:13:45.132
And Brother George...

891
01:13:45.842 --> 01:13:49.553
would like to share his version
of that miracle with you.

892
01:13:49.554 --> 01:13:51.471
So let's give a proper welcome

893
01:13:51.472 --> 01:13:54.391
to the former heavyweight champion
of the world

894
01:13:54.392 --> 01:13:57.603
and our new brother in Christ,
George Foreman!

895
01:14:13.202 --> 01:14:14.620
Thank you, Reverend Stokes.

896
01:14:17.874 --> 01:14:18.874
I...

897
01:14:19.876 --> 01:14:20.960
was in a fight.

898
01:14:24.755 --> 01:14:26.424
I used to love fighting.

899
01:14:39.645 --> 01:14:41.272
I was in the dressing room, and...

900
01:14:43.608 --> 01:14:45.693
And Jesus Christ came alive in me.

901
01:14:49.113 --> 01:14:50.113
And...

902
01:14:51.115 --> 01:14:52.325
And because of it...

903
01:14:53.534 --> 01:14:55.411
I wanna give my life to God.

904
01:14:59.498 --> 01:15:00.498
All right.

905
01:15:01.167 --> 01:15:02.502
I wanna be a preacher.

906
01:15:08.633 --> 01:15:09.634
Thank you, Jesus.

907
01:15:10.468 --> 01:15:12.303
- Praise God!
- All right.

908
01:15:13.179 --> 01:15:16.598
He may have finally found somebody
who can tell him what to do.

909
01:15:16.599 --> 01:15:18.266
Praise Jesus!

910
01:15:18.267 --> 01:15:20.519
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

911
01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.978
- Yeah.
- Praise Jesus.

912
01:15:21.979 --> 01:15:23.189
Praise Jesus.

913
01:15:30.613 --> 01:15:32.615
You put on quite a show in there.

914
01:15:33.574 --> 01:15:35.368
I'm glad you was here to see it.

915
01:15:36.202 --> 01:15:39.789
So Gil's been setting the traps.
We still got us a path to Ali.

916
01:15:40.748 --> 01:15:41.749
I'm done.

917
01:15:42.792 --> 01:15:44.335
I'm not gonna box anymore.

918
01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:48.923
- You a fighter.
- I'm not a fighter.

919
01:15:50.716 --> 01:15:51.801
Not anymore.

920
01:15:54.387 --> 01:15:56.222
So how are you gonna take care
of your kids?

921
01:15:57.223 --> 01:15:58.891
I'm gonna follow God.

922
01:16:00.059 --> 01:16:03.020
Do you know
what you're walking away from, son?

923
01:16:03.604 --> 01:16:04.855
You know, I...

924
01:16:04.856 --> 01:16:07.191
I can't even make a fist anymore, Doc.

925
01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:10.736
It's like he reached inside of me...

926
01:16:11.821 --> 01:16:13.948
just took out all my anger.

927
01:16:15.157 --> 01:16:16.701
That anger inside of you...

928
01:16:17.493 --> 01:16:18.786
it made you king.

929
01:16:19.745 --> 01:16:20.746
I saw it.

930
01:16:21.455 --> 01:16:23.874
Now you wanna tell me that it's all gone?

931
01:16:23.875 --> 01:16:28.337
Remember when you told me that
you traded in one uniform for another?

932
01:16:31.257 --> 01:16:32.592
That's what I'm doing.

933
01:16:34.594 --> 01:16:37.512
You can understand that, can't you?

934
01:16:37.513 --> 01:16:39.765
I had no say, George.

935
01:16:41.017 --> 01:16:42.727
My choice was made for me.

936
01:16:45.021 --> 01:16:46.272
So was mine.

937
01:16:50.776 --> 01:16:52.445
I don't believe you, George.

938
01:17:03.456 --> 01:17:07.460
<i>For 28 years,
I used my fists to get respect.</i>

939
01:17:09.295 --> 01:17:11.589
<i>I knew I had to start using my heart.</i>

940
01:17:14.383 --> 01:17:15.760
<i>I just didn't know how.</i>

941
01:17:17.553 --> 01:17:20.264
<i>She told me
Big George Foreman was at the door.</i>

942
01:17:21.015 --> 01:17:23.725
And I said, "Beatrice, you are crazy.

943
01:17:23.726 --> 01:17:25.894
George Foreman ain't coming
to see the champ

944
01:17:25.895 --> 01:17:28.314
unless he's looking for another whupping."

945
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:43.079
So I've come here...

946
01:17:44.705 --> 01:17:47.791
to tell you that I found Jesus.

947
01:17:47.792 --> 01:17:48.918
You found Jesus?

948
01:17:49.710 --> 01:17:52.713
Congratulations, George.
I did not know he was lost.

949
01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.801
I came here...

950
01:17:58.761 --> 01:18:00.595
to ask for your forgiveness.

951
01:18:00.596 --> 01:18:02.722
- For my forgiveness?
- Yes.

952
01:18:02.723 --> 01:18:04.724
I'm the one who knocked you out.

953
01:18:04.725 --> 01:18:05.893
You know...

954
01:18:07.687 --> 01:18:08.980
after Zaire...

955
01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:13.234
I hated you, Muhammad.

956
01:18:14.527 --> 01:18:15.528
I did.

957
01:18:16.654 --> 01:18:18.281
And I wanted to kill you...

958
01:18:19.156 --> 01:18:20.532
with these hands.

959
01:18:20.533 --> 01:18:24.077
Come on, man.
You want a rematch. I know.

960
01:18:24.078 --> 01:18:25.329
Just come out and say it.

961
01:18:26.038 --> 01:18:27.498
I don't want no rematch.

962
01:18:27.999 --> 01:18:30.750
They told me you retired to preach,
but I didn't believe it.

963
01:18:30.751 --> 01:18:31.751
Well, I...

964
01:18:32.503 --> 01:18:33.920
I wanna help people.

965
01:18:33.921 --> 01:18:35.672
Well, George, help me, okay?

966
01:18:35.673 --> 01:18:38.758
All you got to do is fight Kenny Norton
one more time. Knock him out.

967
01:18:38.759 --> 01:18:41.595
Please, George, knock him out.
Because I sure can't.

968
01:18:41.596 --> 01:18:44.055
You knock him out,
he won't be a top-ranked contender.

969
01:18:44.056 --> 01:18:45.682
I'll give you another shot at the title.

970
01:18:45.683 --> 01:18:48.561
And then we'll both get paid, huh?
Praise Jesus.

971
01:18:53.691 --> 01:18:56.777
I can't help you that way.

972
01:19:02.742 --> 01:19:03.868
All right, brother.

973
01:19:05.161 --> 01:19:06.161
Fine.

974
01:19:08.247 --> 01:19:09.248
I forgive you.

975
01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:14.002
George Foreman, a preacher.

976
01:19:14.003 --> 01:19:16.047
Now I have seen it all.

977
01:19:24.972 --> 01:19:26.057
Hi!

978
01:19:28.267 --> 01:19:30.686
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, Michi.

979
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:34.190
- I love you.
- Michi, take your brother inside.

980
01:19:34.899 --> 01:19:36.192
Go inside, George.

981
01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:41.948
What are you doing here?

982
01:19:47.995 --> 01:19:49.080
I came here...

983
01:19:50.581 --> 01:19:54.669
to tell you how sorry I am
for the way that I treated you.

984
01:19:57.797 --> 01:19:59.048
It wasn't right.

985
01:20:03.594 --> 01:20:07.597
"Let love be without dissimulation.

986
01:20:07.598 --> 01:20:09.892
Cleave to that which is good."

987
01:20:24.156 --> 01:20:25.156
Hi.

988
01:20:28.494 --> 01:20:29.495
I'm George.

989
01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.831
Mary Joan Martelly.

990
01:20:32.832 --> 01:20:36.627
You were sitting in that same seat
the day I gave my testimony.

991
01:20:42.008 --> 01:20:43.593
You always sat up front?

992
01:20:44.427 --> 01:20:47.388
Yes. Helps me stay focused on God.

993
01:20:54.812 --> 01:20:56.647
How's being a preacher going for you?

994
01:20:57.690 --> 01:20:58.691
It's hard.

995
01:20:59.734 --> 01:21:00.734
Real hard.

996
01:21:01.068 --> 01:21:03.821
Harder than getting punched in the face?

997
01:21:07.533 --> 01:21:10.411
Sometimes it feels about the same.

998
01:21:11.996 --> 01:21:14.540
Blessed is the man who remains steadfast.

999
01:21:22.298 --> 01:21:25.343
Brothers and sisters, I am out here today,

1000
01:21:25.968 --> 01:21:27.761
not to lift myself up,

1001
01:21:27.762 --> 01:21:30.348
but to lift up the name of Jesus Christ.

1002
01:21:30.973 --> 01:21:34.351
See, I was a man
who rejected all religion.

1003
01:21:34.352 --> 01:21:36.144
"Jesus" was a cussword to me,

1004
01:21:36.145 --> 01:21:38.605
but the Lord changed my life.

1005
01:21:38.606 --> 01:21:40.398
Wasn't the Lord who changed you.

1006
01:21:40.399 --> 01:21:43.777
It was Jimmy Young.
I seen him beat the hell out of you.

1007
01:21:43.778 --> 01:21:45.488
Did you at least pinch him?

1008
01:21:47.615 --> 01:21:50.618
Don't you miss being in that ring,
big fella?

1009
01:21:54.205 --> 01:21:55.373
I'll die...

1010
01:21:55.915 --> 01:21:58.125
before I get back in that ring again.

1011
01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:00.460
Now...

1012
01:22:05.424 --> 01:22:08.969
Now, you could take
all of the Rockefellers' money

1013
01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:10.971
and all of the Kennedys' money,

1014
01:22:10.972 --> 01:22:12.597
and you put that together,

1015
01:22:12.598 --> 01:22:15.893
it wouldn't come to a down payment
on my getting back in that ring again.

1016
01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:21.314
Praise God. Thank you, Jesus.

1017
01:22:21.315 --> 01:22:23.317
Jesus is alive today.

1018
01:22:25.444 --> 01:22:26.444
I...

1019
01:22:27.029 --> 01:22:29.531
I felt bad for how I acted last Sunday.

1020
01:22:29.532 --> 01:22:32.326
- Well, how did you act?
- Kind of cold.

1021
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:36.663
- Yes.
- Well, you had a reputation.

1022
01:22:36.664 --> 01:22:38.541
And not a godly one.

1023
01:22:40.293 --> 01:22:41.711
Well, I'm different now.

1024
01:22:42.587 --> 01:22:45.005
You know, I hadn't yet learnt the secret

1025
01:22:45.006 --> 01:22:48.133
to enjoying every day for itself.

1026
01:22:48.134 --> 01:22:51.720
How to make the most of each day
as it comes.

1027
01:22:51.721 --> 01:22:53.097
Do you have children?

1028
01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.100
Yes.

1029
01:22:57.977 --> 01:23:00.687
They don't live with me full-time,
you know, which is hard,

1030
01:23:00.688 --> 01:23:04.108
but I'm gonna be seeing
a whole lot more of them now.

1031
01:23:05.067 --> 01:23:06.067
Yes, indeed.

1032
01:23:07.028 --> 01:23:08.362
I'm glad to hear that.

1033
01:23:15.745 --> 01:23:17.496
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1034
01:23:46.943 --> 01:23:47.943
You okay?

1035
01:23:48.444 --> 01:23:50.988
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I thought we were going to a movie.

1036
01:23:53.533 --> 01:23:54.951
I wanna show you something.

1037
01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:58.162
What's that look like to you?

1038
01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.541
A church that's run out of faith.

1039
01:24:03.251 --> 01:24:04.252
No.

1040
01:24:05.086 --> 01:24:06.712
You know, I'm gonna buy it.

1041
01:24:08.256 --> 01:24:09.966
And I'm gonna preach in it.

1042
01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:13.052
And be the best I can be.

1043
01:24:14.428 --> 01:24:16.347
And I'm gonna spread his word.

1044
01:24:21.394 --> 01:24:23.104
Do you believe I can do that?

1045
01:24:23.771 --> 01:24:24.772
Yes.

1046
01:24:25.439 --> 01:24:26.440
I do.

1047
01:24:33.197 --> 01:24:37.701
<i>You got to fight for your faith.
Every one of you, every day.</i>

1048
01:24:37.702 --> 01:24:42.164
One Sunday morning,
when the sun is shining real bright...

1049
01:24:45.251 --> 01:24:48.880
and your husband, he's standing there
with his swim trunks on,

1050
01:24:49.964 --> 01:24:51.174
holding a blanket,

1051
01:24:51.966 --> 01:24:53.885
saying, "The beach is waiting, baby!"

1052
01:24:54.677 --> 01:24:56.262
And you think to yourself, you say:

1053
01:24:58.014 --> 01:25:01.350
"Is missing one little service
really gonna hurt me?"

1054
01:25:04.312 --> 01:25:08.231
Now, if you don't shine your shoes,
do they get shined?

1055
01:25:08.232 --> 01:25:09.150
No.

1056
01:25:09.151 --> 01:25:12.027
- Don't wash your clothes, they get washed?
- No.

1057
01:25:12.028 --> 01:25:15.198
If you don't fight for your faith,
it'll fall away.

1058
01:25:16.699 --> 01:25:18.909
You gotta do it.
Gotta fight for your faith.

1059
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:20.535
If you gonna fight for anything,
fight for that.

1060
01:25:20.536 --> 01:25:21.536
Amen.

1061
01:25:23.372 --> 01:25:25.291
Thank you. All right. Take care.

1062
01:25:26.167 --> 01:25:27.501
All right. All right.

1063
01:25:27.502 --> 01:25:28.836
Pastor Foreman.

1064
01:25:29.629 --> 01:25:30.963
I need your help.

1065
01:25:32.006 --> 01:25:34.091
Would you train my grandson, Jalen?

1066
01:25:34.759 --> 01:25:37.052
If he had a good male role model
to teach him,

1067
01:25:37.053 --> 01:25:39.095
instead of the boys that he's...

1068
01:25:39.096 --> 01:25:43.600
Well, I'd sign up to train with Ali
but not the guy who lost to him.

1069
01:25:43.601 --> 01:25:46.978
- Jalen...
- It's all right. It's all right.

1070
01:25:46.979 --> 01:25:49.064
He remind me of myself when I was his age.

1071
01:25:49.065 --> 01:25:50.524
Can you teach him to box?

1072
01:25:50.525 --> 01:25:52.442
Well, boxing's not the answer.

1073
01:25:52.443 --> 01:25:54.277
You see, the answers are in here.

1074
01:25:54.278 --> 01:25:55.946
Young man, you read the Bible,

1075
01:25:55.947 --> 01:25:58.031
keep coming to church,
everything will work out.

1076
01:25:58.032 --> 01:26:00.742
All right.
All right, sister. God bless you.

1077
01:26:00.743 --> 01:26:02.578
- Have a good day. All right.
- Okay.

1078
01:26:03.538 --> 01:26:04.997
Something smells good in here.

1079
01:26:10.628 --> 01:26:12.255
- I love you.
- I love you.

1080
01:26:13.422 --> 01:26:14.423
Hey!

1081
01:26:16.133 --> 01:26:17.384
You're getting heavy.

1082
01:26:17.385 --> 01:26:18.468
Come here, boy.

1083
01:26:18.469 --> 01:26:20.011
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah.

1084
01:26:20.012 --> 01:26:22.138
- All right, let me get a kiss.
- No. No way.

1085
01:26:22.139 --> 01:26:24.516
Give me a kiss. Come here.
Don't wanna kiss your daddy?

1086
01:26:24.517 --> 01:26:27.686
<i>To the epidemic of street violence
that's been plaguing the Fifth Ward.</i>

1087
01:26:27.687 --> 01:26:30.230
<i>Two suspects have been apprehended
in this robbery.</i>

1088
01:26:30.231 --> 01:26:32.983
<i>- An attempted robbery...</i>
- Take your brother to the other room.

1089
01:26:32.984 --> 01:26:34.985
<i>With one man in critical condition.</i>

1090
01:26:34.986 --> 01:26:37.613
<i>The juveniles are being held without bail.</i>

1091
01:26:40.575 --> 01:26:41.576
You okay?

1092
01:26:46.998 --> 01:26:48.791
His grandmother brought him to me...

1093
01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:51.002
last week.

1094
01:26:51.627 --> 01:26:52.920
That same kid.

1095
01:26:54.630 --> 01:26:58.801
But I was so, you know,
full of myself being full of God that...

1096
01:27:01.804 --> 01:27:02.889
I missed it.

1097
01:27:03.806 --> 01:27:05.349
What did you miss, George?

1098
01:27:08.102 --> 01:27:10.188
I should have met that kid where he was.

1099
01:27:12.732 --> 01:27:14.483
Not where I wanted him to be.

1100
01:27:21.741 --> 01:27:24.952
George, are you sure you wanna do this?

1101
01:27:26.537 --> 01:27:27.538
Yeah.

1102
01:27:28.331 --> 01:27:32.877
Okay. I'll talk to the bank about moving
a few of your assets around.

1103
01:27:34.128 --> 01:27:35.838
Come on.
I wanna show y'all something here.

1104
01:27:37.089 --> 01:27:38.716
Now, I have an idea.

1105
01:27:49.477 --> 01:27:50.728
All right, I got you.

1106
01:27:53.648 --> 01:27:54.856
That's heavy.

1107
01:27:54.857 --> 01:27:56.984
Help me with this bed over here!

1108
01:28:00.863 --> 01:28:02.156
Hurry up, now.

1109
01:28:05.284 --> 01:28:06.869
That's looking good.

1110
01:28:12.959 --> 01:28:15.210
- Tighten up these ropes.
- Hook that up.

1111
01:28:15.211 --> 01:28:16.921
- Make sure they're not loose.
- Got it.

1112
01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.485
I would've blocked it,
but somebody raised the rim.

1113
01:28:40.486 --> 01:28:42.071
Hey, fellas. Come on in.

1114
01:28:43.114 --> 01:28:44.740
Come on in. Enjoy yourself.

1115
01:29:01.632 --> 01:29:03.550
Hey, Nate. Ain't seen you in a while.

1116
01:29:03.551 --> 01:29:06.345
Hey, nice haircut, man.
Look, it's almost as good as mine.

1117
01:29:08.181 --> 01:29:09.556
What's going on, y'all?

1118
01:29:09.557 --> 01:29:11.266
Hey, sister. How you doing?

1119
01:29:11.267 --> 01:29:12.434
Good, good.

1120
01:29:12.435 --> 01:29:15.688
Hey, man. You're always fouling somebody.
I see you.

1121
01:29:16.898 --> 01:29:18.065
Looking good.

1122
01:29:23.321 --> 01:29:24.405
I got this, y'all.

1123
01:29:25.072 --> 01:29:26.114
Don't worry about it.

1124
01:29:26.115 --> 01:29:29.201
This has never happened here
at the youth center before.

1125
01:29:29.202 --> 01:29:31.704
- This just doesn't make any sense.
- Roberta, what's going on?

1126
01:29:32.663 --> 01:29:36.292
Are you absolutely sure?
Because it just doesn't sound right.

1127
01:29:39.128 --> 01:29:43.090
Okay. No, I understand.
We'll take care of it immediately.

1128
01:29:47.303 --> 01:29:49.805
Power company said we never paid the bill.

1129
01:29:50.556 --> 01:29:51.556
Really?

1130
01:29:51.974 --> 01:29:55.061
Well, just get Des on it.

1131
01:29:55.645 --> 01:29:57.188
He didn't come in today.

1132
01:29:58.564 --> 01:29:59.940
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Foreman,</i>

1133
01:29:59.941 --> 01:30:01.900
but I don't understand
how you didn't know.

1134
01:30:01.901 --> 01:30:03.026
How much is left?

1135
01:30:03.027 --> 01:30:04.903
A little over $2000.

1136
01:30:04.904 --> 01:30:06.197
That can't be right.

1137
01:30:07.365 --> 01:30:09.574
Just use some of the money
from my investments accounts

1138
01:30:09.575 --> 01:30:10.825
to keep the youth center open.

1139
01:30:10.826 --> 01:30:13.036
Those investments went belly-up
over the last year.

1140
01:30:13.037 --> 01:30:14.621
Des told me we were good.

1141
01:30:14.622 --> 01:30:16.581
I'm sorry, but that's just not true.

1142
01:30:16.582 --> 01:30:19.084
He put them into solid stocks
to set me up for life.

1143
01:30:19.085 --> 01:30:21.878
No. These were all high-risk gambles.

1144
01:30:21.879 --> 01:30:23.171
No, that's...

1145
01:30:23.172 --> 01:30:26.758
Look, I'm sorry, Mr. Foreman,
but if these payments aren't made soon,

1146
01:30:26.759 --> 01:30:29.512
the bank will have
to start repossessing the property.

1147
01:30:59.667 --> 01:31:02.461
Roy says you got the whole town
looking for Desmond.

1148
01:31:03.379 --> 01:31:04.380
That's right.

1149
01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:07.842
You need to leave him be.

1150
01:31:10.011 --> 01:31:11.721
I gave it all to him.

1151
01:31:14.348 --> 01:31:15.641
And he lost it.

1152
01:31:18.352 --> 01:31:19.896
Not just the youth center.

1153
01:31:24.567 --> 01:31:27.195
Everything I worked for...

1154
01:31:30.781 --> 01:31:31.823
it's gone.

1155
01:31:31.824 --> 01:31:32.909
No, no, no.

1156
01:31:34.118 --> 01:31:37.330
Everything you worked for is in here.

1157
01:31:41.959 --> 01:31:44.170
Ever since you was a little boy...

1158
01:31:47.423 --> 01:31:50.009
I tried to put you on the right path.

1159
01:31:52.678 --> 01:31:53.846
But you found it.

1160
01:31:54.847 --> 01:31:56.265
All by yourself.

1161
01:31:57.308 --> 01:31:58.559
You found God.

1162
01:32:00.144 --> 01:32:01.312
Be godly.

1163
01:32:04.815 --> 01:32:07.944
Don't let Desmond Baker take that
from you too.

1164
01:32:37.139 --> 01:32:38.139
Tell me.

1165
01:32:38.766 --> 01:32:42.895
Tell me you put the money somewhere else.
In some other account I don't know about!

1166
01:32:43.646 --> 01:32:45.814
- Tell me it's not all gone.
- It's gone.

1167
01:32:45.815 --> 01:32:48.525
- I lost it.
- Tell me it's not all gone.

1168
01:32:48.526 --> 01:32:49.819
I lost it.

1169
01:33:00.413 --> 01:33:02.164
I'm sorry, George.

1170
01:33:11.674 --> 01:33:13.843
Any time you're ready, Mr. Foreman.

1171
01:33:14.427 --> 01:33:17.053
This summer,
when you're out grilling with the family,

1172
01:33:17.054 --> 01:33:19.890
there's only one sauce
that has the sweetness and the spiceness

1173
01:33:19.891 --> 01:33:21.558
that everyone loves.

1174
01:33:21.559 --> 01:33:23.227
- Miss...
- You said "spiceness," George.

1175
01:33:24.061 --> 01:33:25.061
I did?

1176
01:33:25.062 --> 01:33:27.607
Yeah. "Spiceness" isn't a word.

1177
01:33:32.653 --> 01:33:35.030
Hi. How are you? Thank you.

1178
01:33:35.031 --> 01:33:37.533
Can you sign this, champ? Thank you.

1179
01:33:38.576 --> 01:33:39.576
- Hello.
- Hi.

1180
01:33:39.577 --> 01:33:40.661
Thank you so much.

1181
01:33:44.916 --> 01:33:46.125
Thank you so much.

1182
01:33:48.169 --> 01:33:49.378
Thank you.

1183
01:33:52.215 --> 01:33:54.049
When you're out grilling with the family,

1184
01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:58.053
there's only one sauce
that has the sweetness and the spice

1185
01:33:58.054 --> 01:33:59.680
that everyone loves.

1186
01:34:01.015 --> 01:34:04.351
Miss Tammie's Mesquite
and Original Barbecue Sauce.

1187
01:34:04.352 --> 01:34:05.686
Get them while they're hot.

1188
01:34:07.355 --> 01:34:10.441
Adding in the money
from Miss Tammie's commercial...

1189
01:34:11.817 --> 01:34:13.027
Chump change.

1190
01:34:14.529 --> 01:34:17.447
That's what they pay you
for looking like a chump on TV.

1191
01:34:17.448 --> 01:34:19.491
Every little bit counts, George.

1192
01:34:19.492 --> 01:34:21.202
I done sold everything I have.

1193
01:34:22.995 --> 01:34:24.539
I done cut every corner.

1194
01:34:28.167 --> 01:34:29.168
How are we?

1195
01:34:33.923 --> 01:34:35.174
Short.

1196
01:34:35.758 --> 01:34:36.884
Well, how short?

1197
01:34:38.010 --> 01:34:39.387
Not even close.

1198
01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:12.812
I know you hate this thing.

1199
01:36:12.813 --> 01:36:14.649
It's just a bag. I don't hate it.

1200
01:36:15.274 --> 01:36:16.776
It is filthy though.

1201
01:36:19.487 --> 01:36:21.696
- Come to bed.
- I'm not tired.

1202
01:36:21.697 --> 01:36:23.657
But you have a sermon to give tomorrow.

1203
01:36:23.658 --> 01:36:25.283
Pastor Carl's filling in for me.

1204
01:36:25.284 --> 01:36:26.619
Why?

1205
01:36:28.204 --> 01:36:30.205
So I ain't gotta stand up there,

1206
01:36:30.206 --> 01:36:32.290
tell all those people
how they should live.

1207
01:36:32.291 --> 01:36:34.376
That's what a pastor does, right?

1208
01:36:34.377 --> 01:36:36.754
It's my fault the money's gone, Joan.

1209
01:36:37.463 --> 01:36:38.839
Don't say that, George.

1210
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.591
Well, I knew what Des was.

1211
01:36:42.176 --> 01:36:43.886
And I trusted him anyway?

1212
01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:56.148
I need to fight again.

1213
01:37:00.194 --> 01:37:01.988
You swore you wouldn't.

1214
01:37:05.116 --> 01:37:08.077
That moment when you first
came up to me in church,

1215
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:12.455
I saw a man who wanted to change his life.

1216
01:37:12.456 --> 01:37:14.500
I fell in love with that man.

1217
01:37:15.543 --> 01:37:18.837
The old you, I don't know.

1218
01:37:18.838 --> 01:37:20.298
And I don't want to.

1219
01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:22.340
Joan.

1220
01:37:23.509 --> 01:37:25.928
There's only two things I know how to do.

1221
01:37:27.597 --> 01:37:29.849
That's box and preach.

1222
01:37:32.685 --> 01:37:33.853
But preaching...

1223
01:37:37.773 --> 01:37:39.567
Preaching won't pay the bills.

1224
01:37:40.318 --> 01:37:42.403
What if all your rage comes back?

1225
01:37:46.324 --> 01:37:48.284
What if you can't win without it?

1226
01:37:52.705 --> 01:37:55.081
Step forward. Step back.

1227
01:37:55.082 --> 01:37:57.460
Step to the left. To the right.

1228
01:37:58.169 --> 01:38:00.295
Step forward. Step back.

1229
01:38:00.296 --> 01:38:03.048
Step left. Step right.

1230
01:38:03.049 --> 01:38:05.467
Step forward. Step back.

1231
01:38:05.468 --> 01:38:07.761
Step left. Step right. Great.

1232
01:38:07.762 --> 01:38:10.306
Now. Now, cut me off! Cut me off.

1233
01:38:13.267 --> 01:38:14.644
<i>When you quit boxing...</i>

1234
01:38:17.438 --> 01:38:19.440
you dang near broke my heart.

1235
01:38:22.151 --> 01:38:23.694
It felt like you quit me.

1236
01:38:26.781 --> 01:38:28.074
But I came back here.

1237
01:38:28.699 --> 01:38:30.201
I dug back in.

1238
01:38:31.077 --> 01:38:32.077
And...

1239
01:38:32.787 --> 01:38:34.621
you know, funny thing happened.

1240
01:38:34.622 --> 01:38:36.666
I remembered who I was.

1241
01:38:39.710 --> 01:38:41.295
I'm happy here, George.

1242
01:38:42.588 --> 01:38:44.590
You made me something once, Doc.

1243
01:38:46.217 --> 01:38:47.843
You can do it again.

1244
01:38:47.844 --> 01:38:50.137
Joe Louis tried to come back.

1245
01:38:50.847 --> 01:38:53.014
Marciano almost killed him in the ring.

1246
01:38:53.015 --> 01:38:57.018
Joe Louis tried to start at the top.
But we'll start at the bottom.

1247
01:38:57.019 --> 01:38:59.771
You're old. They'll call us a circus act.

1248
01:38:59.772 --> 01:39:01.816
But not if we keep winning.

1249
01:39:02.441 --> 01:39:03.442
Doc.

1250
01:39:04.735 --> 01:39:06.821
You know, we can do something here.

1251
01:39:07.947 --> 01:39:10.950
Something that's beyond their imagination.

1252
01:39:12.410 --> 01:39:17.582
The morning that we wake up to fight
for that heavyweight championship belt...

1253
01:39:18.624 --> 01:39:20.959
oh, man,

1254
01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:22.962
the air's gonna taste different.

1255
01:39:24.130 --> 01:39:27.258
The sun, that's gonna look different.

1256
01:39:29.010 --> 01:39:31.929
Only two men
on this whole earth is gonna matter.

1257
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:34.265
And we'll be the both of them.

1258
01:39:42.815 --> 01:39:43.941
How much you weigh?

1259
01:39:45.234 --> 01:39:46.610
How much I wait?

1260
01:39:46.611 --> 01:39:48.945
I said, how much do you weigh?

1261
01:39:48.946 --> 01:39:50.323
Oh, how much I weigh.

1262
01:39:51.490 --> 01:39:53.576
- Like on a scale.
- Yeah.

1263
01:39:56.913 --> 01:39:59.664
About 299.

1264
01:39:59.665 --> 01:40:03.001
Really more toward the 85 range,
but about 29...

1265
01:40:03.002 --> 01:40:04.461
I would say 299.

1266
01:40:04.462 --> 01:40:06.797
Last I checked, lying was a sin.

1267
01:40:10.927 --> 01:40:13.678
I'm about 315,

1268
01:40:13.679 --> 01:40:16.057
318 after breakfast.

1269
01:40:16.891 --> 01:40:19.185
You get down to 265...

1270
01:40:20.645 --> 01:40:21.687
then call me.

1271
01:40:40.373 --> 01:40:42.166
I think my gym clothes shrunk.

1272
01:40:56.556 --> 01:40:58.432
Hey, George, take it easy, man.

1273
01:40:59.517 --> 01:41:01.060
You're gonna have a heart attack.

1274
01:41:05.022 --> 01:41:06.566
That's nasty, George.

1275
01:41:36.387 --> 01:41:38.346
All right, who's ready for pancakes?

1276
01:41:38.347 --> 01:41:41.017
I'm ready for pancakes. Yes, indeed.

1277
01:41:42.268 --> 01:41:43.310
There you go, baby.

1278
01:41:43.311 --> 01:41:46.147
Yep. I'm gonna get me, like, five of them.

1279
01:42:52.255 --> 01:42:54.966
Okay. Get on up there.

1280
01:42:55.591 --> 01:42:56.968
That's where the fighting is.

1281
01:43:00.012 --> 01:43:01.013
Time!

1282
01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.655
Come on, cut him off!

1283
01:43:19.365 --> 01:43:20.658
Cut him off!

1284
01:43:21.492 --> 01:43:22.785
Cut him off!

1285
01:43:29.125 --> 01:43:30.293
Move your feet.

1286
01:43:33.963 --> 01:43:35.673
Come on. Come on, George.

1287
01:43:38.509 --> 01:43:39.635
Time!

1288
01:43:46.225 --> 01:43:49.186
We're gonna need
to get you some new tricks.

1289
01:43:49.187 --> 01:43:52.732
Some new arms
and some new legs might help too.

1290
01:43:53.941 --> 01:43:56.652
This ain't funny, George.
This ain't funny.

1291
01:44:25.348 --> 01:44:26.432
What's wrong?

1292
01:44:31.729 --> 01:44:34.732
I think the Lord spoke to me last night.

1293
01:44:48.579 --> 01:44:50.081
Well, what'd he say?

1294
01:44:54.085 --> 01:44:55.711
He showed me a vision.

1295
01:44:57.338 --> 01:44:58.339
Of you.

1296
01:44:58.923 --> 01:45:01.843
Winning
the heavyweight championship again.

1297
01:45:06.389 --> 01:45:07.890
I can't explain it.

1298
01:45:10.142 --> 01:45:11.143
It's like...

1299
01:45:12.979 --> 01:45:17.023
he's gonna lift you up
in the middle of that ring,

1300
01:45:17.024 --> 01:45:20.528
so you'll lift him up
in front of millions of people.

1301
01:45:42.175 --> 01:45:43.593
How you feeling?

1302
01:45:45.887 --> 01:45:46.888
I feel good.

1303
01:45:47.597 --> 01:45:49.182
This is for real tonight.

1304
01:45:50.558 --> 01:45:53.769
It's time to wake up that old tiger
and put him back to work.

1305
01:45:55.438 --> 01:45:56.814
That man's gone, Doc.

1306
01:45:58.274 --> 01:46:00.025
We gonna do this a new way now.

1307
01:46:00.026 --> 01:46:02.153
Son, there's no new way
when it come to that ring.

1308
01:46:02.945 --> 01:46:04.613
There's him and there's you.

1309
01:46:04.614 --> 01:46:06.824
There's hurt or be hurt.

1310
01:46:07.742 --> 01:46:09.493
- It's fighting.
- It's boxing.

1311
01:46:11.454 --> 01:46:12.455
It's a sport.

1312
01:46:13.706 --> 01:46:14.707
With rules.

1313
01:46:19.545 --> 01:46:21.214
Better know what you're doing.

1314
01:46:40.775 --> 01:46:45.278
It's been ten years since George Foreman
set foot in a boxing ring.

1315
01:46:45.279 --> 01:46:49.032
What does
this Foreman reincarnation even look like?

1316
01:46:49.033 --> 01:46:52.994
Hey, Zouski's no world champion,
but he's a seasoned fighter,

1317
01:46:52.995 --> 01:46:54.955
and George has danger in there tonight.

1318
01:46:54.956 --> 01:46:57.374
You know what scares me
the most about tonight?

1319
01:46:57.375 --> 01:46:58.709
Getting knocked out by a bum?

1320
01:46:59.377 --> 01:47:00.377
No.

1321
01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:03.256
Taking my robe off
in front of all these people.

1322
01:47:03.881 --> 01:47:06.424
The last time they saw me,
I looked like Superman.

1323
01:47:06.425 --> 01:47:10.054
So now you look like the Michelin Man.
This ain't no beauty contest.

1324
01:47:17.436 --> 01:47:18.479
All right!

1325
01:47:28.614 --> 01:47:32.200
Gentlemen, I gave you instructions
in the dressing room.

1326
01:47:32.201 --> 01:47:34.411
Obey my commands.

1327
01:47:34.412 --> 01:47:37.539
Give me a good clean fight. George...

1328
01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:40.542
Don't look at him.
He's trying to mess with your mind.

1329
01:47:40.543 --> 01:47:41.627
Touch them up.

1330
01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:43.713
Come on, let's go.

1331
01:47:48.885 --> 01:47:53.471
So George Foreman begins
the most unlikely of comebacks.

1332
01:47:53.472 --> 01:47:56.309
- All right, George.
- Keep your hands up. Keep your hands up.

1333
01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:01.521
This Sacramento crowd is getting restless.

1334
01:48:01.522 --> 01:48:04.358
- Quit dancing!
- They're looking for some action.

1335
01:48:09.322 --> 01:48:10.907
Stop playing with him.

1336
01:48:15.119 --> 01:48:17.496
You come here to fight
or you wanna go home? Come on!

1337
01:48:18.164 --> 01:48:19.916
Let's do this. Let's fight.
You wanna fight?

1338
01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:28.716
There it is.

1339
01:48:32.178 --> 01:48:34.055
Cheap shot after the bell.

1340
01:48:51.697 --> 01:48:52.740
Let him out.

1341
01:48:54.242 --> 01:48:57.035
It's now or never.
You let him out. Let him out.

1342
01:48:57.036 --> 01:48:58.663
I'm gonna do this my way, Doc.

1343
01:49:00.331 --> 01:49:01.707
I'm gonna do it my way.

1344
01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:19.517
I'll tell you this,
George can still punch.

1345
01:49:24.397 --> 01:49:26.983
Come on! Hit him like you hit Frazier!

1346
01:49:31.404 --> 01:49:33.990
Finish him!

1347
01:49:36.826 --> 01:49:39.494
He has Zouski in huge trouble.

1348
01:49:39.495 --> 01:49:41.205
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

1349
01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:44.583
Come on, man.
Can't you see he's hurt? Stop the fight.

1350
01:49:44.584 --> 01:49:46.085
Do your job. Come on.

1351
01:49:47.295 --> 01:49:48.462
Do your job.

1352
01:49:49.255 --> 01:49:50.882
Come on, George.

1353
01:49:54.635 --> 01:49:58.638
- That's enough. That's enough.
- And it's done. The ref has seen enough.

1354
01:49:58.639 --> 01:50:02.435
Foreman takes his first step back
with a big win.

1355
01:50:12.111 --> 01:50:14.905
Let's hear it
for fat, old, bald guys, huh?

1356
01:50:14.906 --> 01:50:17.158
Yeah! Go get them, George!

1357
01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:22.662
<i>That rumble you hear is
the George Foreman Comeback Express.</i>

1358
01:50:22.663 --> 01:50:25.624
<i>You best believe
it's picking up some serious steam.</i>

1359
01:50:25.625 --> 01:50:27.042
<i>There's an old saying:</i>

1360
01:50:27.043 --> 01:50:29.044
<i>"It's not the size
of the man in the fight,</i>

1361
01:50:29.045 --> 01:50:31.421
<i>but the size of the fight in the man."</i>

1362
01:50:31.422 --> 01:50:35.008
<i>All those ring experts
who were making fun of George's size</i>

1363
01:50:35.009 --> 01:50:36.844
<i>sure aren't laughing anymore.</i>

1364
01:50:37.678 --> 01:50:41.390
<i>Foreman is forcing the boxing world
to stand up and pay attention.</i>

1365
01:50:42.058 --> 01:50:45.852
<i>Never before has a boxer stayed away
from the ring this long,</i>

1366
01:50:45.853 --> 01:50:47.854
<i>then fought his way back into contention.</i>

1367
01:50:47.855 --> 01:50:51.234
<i>Just how far, how high can he take this?</i>

1368
01:50:56.989 --> 01:51:00.659
Back tonight, please welcome
former heavyweight champion of the world,

1369
01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:02.078
George Foreman.

1370
01:51:03.663 --> 01:51:05.540
- Good to see you, George.
- Good to see you.

1371
01:51:07.083 --> 01:51:08.708
Now, tell me, George,

1372
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:12.045
all these guys you've been fighting,
where do you find them?

1373
01:51:12.046 --> 01:51:15.800
Gas stations, barrooms,
and bowling alleys, mostly.

1374
01:51:17.426 --> 01:51:20.262
- Sounds like pretty stiff competition.
- Oh, yeah.

1375
01:51:20.263 --> 01:51:22.806
But I'm tired of people saying
I'll only fight these guys

1376
01:51:22.807 --> 01:51:25.767
unless they on respirators,
'cause that's a lie.

1377
01:51:25.768 --> 01:51:29.146
They gotta be off the respirator
at least five days before I fight them.

1378
01:51:30.481 --> 01:51:32.232
Now, tell us about your sons, George.

1379
01:51:32.233 --> 01:51:33.483
I got four boys.

1380
01:51:33.484 --> 01:51:35.527
Now, the names are, again...?

1381
01:51:35.528 --> 01:51:40.074
George Foreman Jr., George Foreman III,
George Foreman IV, and George Foreman V.

1382
01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:44.536
I wanted them all to have something
in common. No different names.

1383
01:51:44.537 --> 01:51:46.955
If one goes up, we all go up.

1384
01:51:46.956 --> 01:51:49.666
If one gets in trouble,
we all get in trouble.

1385
01:51:49.667 --> 01:51:50.751
How about that?

1386
01:51:52.128 --> 01:51:55.380
You're going to fight Evander Holyfield
in Atlantic City, right?

1387
01:51:55.381 --> 01:51:56.464
Yes!

1388
01:51:56.465 --> 01:52:00.051
It is my destiny to win
the heavyweight championship belt again.

1389
01:52:00.052 --> 01:52:01.679
It is time, kids!

1390
01:52:03.514 --> 01:52:05.433
Okay, all right. Here we go.

1391
01:52:07.602 --> 01:52:10.020
<i>And we're back for the seventh round.</i>

1392
01:52:10.021 --> 01:52:12.731
<i>Holyfield, as expected,
is well ahead on the cards.</i>

1393
01:52:12.732 --> 01:52:13.816
Your will, Lord.

1394
01:52:15.151 --> 01:52:18.070
<i>And he rocks Foreman again
with a vicious left.</i>

1395
01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:22.033
<i>George is still standing.
But for how long?</i>

1396
01:52:23.367 --> 01:52:25.286
<i>It's Foreman on the attack now.</i>

1397
01:52:26.078 --> 01:52:27.496
That's it, George.

1398
01:52:28.664 --> 01:52:31.125
<i>What a shot! Holyfield is wobbly.</i>

1399
01:52:32.084 --> 01:52:35.880
<i>Solid punches! Nobody thought
Foreman would even last this long.</i>

1400
01:52:37.048 --> 01:52:39.257
- Get him.
<i>- A round for the ages.</i>

1401
01:52:39.258 --> 01:52:42.135
<i>George Foreman is for real.</i>

1402
01:52:42.136 --> 01:52:44.304
<i>And the crowd is up on its feet.</i>

1403
01:52:44.305 --> 01:52:50.310
<i>117 to 100,
for the winner by unanimous decision,</i>

1404
01:52:50.311 --> 01:52:56.024
<i>and still undisputed heavyweight champion
of the world,</i>

1405
01:52:56.025 --> 01:53:01.280
<i>Evander Holyfield.</i>

1406
01:53:03.866 --> 01:53:05.284
Mr. Foreman.

1407
01:53:06.911 --> 01:53:07.953
Great fight.

1408
01:53:07.954 --> 01:53:10.163
One more round
and you would have had him.

1409
01:53:10.164 --> 01:53:11.164
Thank you.

1410
01:53:16.337 --> 01:53:17.421
Have a seat.

1411
01:53:21.926 --> 01:53:23.176
Good morning.

1412
01:53:23.177 --> 01:53:24.511
What brings you in today?

1413
01:53:24.512 --> 01:53:27.223
I just wanna stay
on top of things this time.

1414
01:53:27.849 --> 01:53:30.434
- Did the HBO check come in?
- Just this morning.

1415
01:53:31.102 --> 01:53:34.272
They said they were hoping
to just break even on the fight.

1416
01:53:41.404 --> 01:53:42.405
What?

1417
01:53:53.624 --> 01:53:55.917
I think you'll enjoy
the rest of your statement too.

1418
01:53:55.918 --> 01:53:57.836
That funny little grill deal you signed

1419
01:53:57.837 --> 01:54:00.714
is starting to generate
some substantial checks.

1420
01:54:00.715 --> 01:54:01.840
Really?

1421
01:54:01.841 --> 01:54:05.135
I'm just surprised
they chose a big, old fat guy like me

1422
01:54:05.136 --> 01:54:07.096
to sell a grill to help people get lean.

1423
01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:08.763
The youth center?

1424
01:54:08.764 --> 01:54:12.268
There's enough money in the account
to keep it open a very long time.

1425
01:54:12.935 --> 01:54:15.615
I think it's safe to say you never have
to fight again, Mr. Foreman.

1426
01:54:16.647 --> 01:54:18.566
Oh, praise the Lord.

1427
01:54:23.696 --> 01:54:24.822
What is it?

1428
01:54:27.909 --> 01:54:29.410
Our job isn't over.

1429
01:54:32.997 --> 01:54:35.041
Maybe I heard him wrong, George.

1430
01:54:36.918 --> 01:54:38.336
You heard him right.

1431
01:54:40.087 --> 01:54:41.088
Your vision...

1432
01:54:44.050 --> 01:54:45.676
it was real.

1433
01:54:46.511 --> 01:54:47.845
He did his part.

1434
01:54:48.679 --> 01:54:50.806
We have to do ours.

1435
01:55:01.025 --> 01:55:02.859
<i>The fight is on.</i>

1436
01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:05.654
<i>Three years after he lost
to Evander Holyfield,</i>

1437
01:55:05.655 --> 01:55:08.448
<i>Big George Foreman,
who's now 45 years old,</i>

1438
01:55:08.449 --> 01:55:11.660
<i>has fought his way back to a title fight.</i>

1439
01:55:11.661 --> 01:55:14.329
<i>But he might wanna be careful
what he wishes for.</i>

1440
01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:18.208
<i>Michael Moorer, the newly-minted
heavyweight champion of the world.</i>

1441
01:55:18.209 --> 01:55:20.710
<i>A new champion, in his prime,</i>

1442
01:55:20.711 --> 01:55:24.465
<i>with speed, power, and a fluid arsenal.</i>

1443
01:55:25.842 --> 01:55:29.636
<i>Thirty of Moorer's 35 wins
have come by knockout.</i>

1444
01:55:29.637 --> 01:55:31.764
<i>He is very difficult to fight.</i>

1445
01:55:32.431 --> 01:55:35.267
<i>The first southpaw champion
in heavyweight history,</i>

1446
01:55:35.268 --> 01:55:37.978
<i>and he boasts a win
over Evander Holyfield,</i>

1447
01:55:37.979 --> 01:55:40.021
<i>who battered Big George.</i>

1448
01:55:40.022 --> 01:55:44.442
<i>There has never been
a 45-year-old heavyweight champion.</i>

1449
01:55:44.443 --> 01:55:47.654
<i>The risk here
to George Foreman isn't losing,</i>

1450
01:55:47.655 --> 01:55:49.030
<i>it's surviving.</i>

1451
01:55:49.031 --> 01:55:50.408
How can you beat that man?

1452
01:56:29.238 --> 01:56:30.740
Get out of the pocket.

1453
01:56:34.744 --> 01:56:35.744
Come on, now.

1454
01:56:39.415 --> 01:56:41.833
Looks like the myth
of George Foreman's power

1455
01:56:41.834 --> 01:56:44.253
is being exposed by Moorer so far.

1456
01:56:45.796 --> 01:56:47.214
Come on, son. What are you doing?

1457
01:56:47.215 --> 01:56:49.299
Solid right hand by Moorer.

1458
01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:52.385
<i>Foreman's taking a beating,
way behind on every scorecard.</i>

1459
01:56:52.386 --> 01:56:54.679
<i>Every time George lands
something significant,</i>

1460
01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:57.516
<i>Moorer comes back
with two or three punches of his own.</i>

1461
01:56:57.517 --> 01:57:01.019
<i>He's having a difficult time
with the younger and faster fighter.</i>

1462
01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.354
<i>George has no timing.</i>

1463
01:57:02.355 --> 01:57:06.234
<i>He's very slow and sluggish.
I thought he'd be sharper than this.</i>

1464
01:57:09.529 --> 01:57:11.948
Moorer's cutting up George like a turkey.

1465
01:57:14.534 --> 01:57:15.742
Our guy's got nothing left.

1466
01:57:15.743 --> 01:57:17.786
Easy. Easy.

1467
01:57:17.787 --> 01:57:20.330
Foreman's left eye beginning to close.

1468
01:57:20.331 --> 01:57:22.750
Well, now he just looks so tired, Jim.

1469
01:57:24.418 --> 01:57:26.211
He deserves all the credit in the world,

1470
01:57:26.212 --> 01:57:29.924
but he is a 45-year-old man
in a young man's game.

1471
01:57:36.055 --> 01:57:39.725
Uppercut by Moorer,
blasted Foreman's chin backward.

1472
01:57:43.479 --> 01:57:45.523
Oh, God. Protect him.

1473
01:57:59.871 --> 01:58:02.123
<i>I've been fighting all my life.</i>

1474
01:58:05.835 --> 01:58:07.502
<i>For a long time,</i>

1475
01:58:07.503 --> 01:58:10.173
<i>I fought
because I felt hated by the world.</i>

1476
01:58:12.341 --> 01:58:14.051
Poor-man!

1477
01:58:21.184 --> 01:58:23.268
<i>I call it the "Ghetto Whopper."</i>

1478
01:58:23.269 --> 01:58:25.938
<i>I will fight George Foreman
anywhere, any time.</i>

1479
01:58:38.576 --> 01:58:39.994
<i>But I've changed.</i>

1480
01:58:42.830 --> 01:58:46.082
Nine rounds against the best in the world.

1481
01:58:46.083 --> 01:58:49.085
There's no shame, son. No shame.

1482
01:58:49.086 --> 01:58:51.005
He's all right. He's all right.

1483
01:58:55.301 --> 01:58:56.427
You okay?

1484
01:59:11.776 --> 01:59:13.611
Come on, George. Come on.

1485
01:59:22.662 --> 01:59:25.914
<i>I had to get knocked down
all the way to the bottom</i>

1486
01:59:25.915 --> 01:59:27.083
<i>to finally see...</i>

1487
01:59:30.294 --> 01:59:34.131
<i>everything I was searching for
was already there.</i>

1488
01:59:45.893 --> 01:59:46.936
<i>And with that...</i>

1489
01:59:48.729 --> 01:59:51.566
<i>you can do the impossible.</i>

1490
01:59:57.530 --> 01:59:59.531
Down goes Moorer on a right hand!

1491
01:59:59.532 --> 02:00:02.410
An unbelievably close-in, right-hand shot.

1492
02:00:05.913 --> 02:00:08.832
- I don't believe it.
- It happened!

1493
02:00:08.833 --> 02:00:11.168
Five. Six.

1494
02:00:11.169 --> 02:00:13.753
- Stay down. Stay down.
<i>- Seven.</i>

1495
02:00:13.754 --> 02:00:17.675
Eight. Nine. Ten.

1496
02:00:18.926 --> 02:00:20.344
It happened!

1497
02:00:21.762 --> 02:00:25.099
George Foreman is
the new heavyweight champ of the world.

1498
02:00:34.066 --> 02:00:36.568
The boxer turned preacher
is down on his knees,

1499
02:00:36.569 --> 02:00:40.072
not in defeat,
but in victory and thanksgiving.

1500
02:00:56.047 --> 02:00:57.089
Thank you.

1501
02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:59.050
No, thank you.

1502
02:01:00.259 --> 02:01:02.220
You're the heavyweight champion
of the world.

1503
02:01:02.970 --> 02:01:06.807
- We did it.
- We did it.

1504
02:01:11.938 --> 02:01:12.939
We did it.

1505
02:01:24.617 --> 02:01:30.330
I have never seen anything like this
in the 25 years of my career, Gil.

1506
02:01:30.331 --> 02:01:35.419
Oldest heavyweight champion
in the world ever, George Foreman.
