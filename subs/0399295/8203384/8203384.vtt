1
00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:15.697
There are over 550 million firearms
in worldwide circulation.

2
00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:19.781
That's one firearm
for every 12 people on the planet.

3
00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:21.995
The only question is,

4
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.833
how do we arm the other 11?

5
00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.894
You don't have to worry.

6
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:40.193
I'm not gonna tell you a pack of lies
to make me look good.

7
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.771
I'm just gonna tell you what happened.

8
00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.777
My name is Yuri Orlov.

9
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.951
When I was a boy,
my family came to America,

10
00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.949
but not all the way.

11
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.703
Like most Ukrainians,
we congregated in Brighton beach.

12
00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:56.160
It reminded us of the Black Sea.

13
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.417
I soon realized we'd just swapped
one hell for another.

14
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:04.171
Even in hell,
an angel sometimes makes an appearance.

15
00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:08.509
I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine
since I was 10 years old.

16
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.137
Of course, she didn't know I existed.

17
00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.724
I was starting to think she had a point.

18
00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.479
For the first 20-odd years of my life,

19
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.778
Little Odessa was to me
what it is to the Q train.

20
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.814
The end of the line.

21
00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:30.285
Oh, I did lie about my name.

22
00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.454
It's not really Yuri Orlov.

23
00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.743
There have been few occasions
in the 20th century

24
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.292
when it's been an advantage to be a Jew.

25
00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.998
But in the '70s, to escape the Soviet Union
our family pretended to be Jewish.

26
00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:45.004
Little about my life
has been kosher ever since.

27
00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:48.633
-How's it going, brother?
-It's not.

28
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.880
That's Vitaly, my younger brother.

29
00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:53.638
He was as lost as me.
He just didn't know it yet.

30
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.935
Yuri, kouda prava, you're late.

31
00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.901
My father took his assumed identity
to heart.

32
00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:07.693
He was more Jewish than most Jews,
which drove my catholic mother crazy.

33
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.446
How many times? I can't eat shellfish.

34
00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.532
-It's trayf.
-You're not Jewish.

35
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:14.988
I like it.

36
00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.699
I like the hat.

37
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.877
To remind us there is something above us.

38
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.625
I like that.

39
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.676
-I'm going to temple.
-You're not going to temple.

40
00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.924
You go to temple more than the rabbi.

41
00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:38.812
Yuri, don't forget to check the specials
at the palace.

42
00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:44.647
Growing up in Little Odessa,
murder was an everyday part of life.

43
00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:48.071
Russian mobsters had also migrated
from the Soviet Union.

44
00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.532
And when they came to America,
their baggage came with them.

45
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.742
There was always some gangster
getting whacked in my neighborhood,

46
00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.869
but I'd never seen it with my own eyes.

47
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.373
I had this knack of showing up
five minutes before something went down,

48
00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:03.920
or five minutes after.

49
00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.292
Not that day.

50
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.026
It hit me.

51
00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.325
It couldn't have hit me harder
if I was the one who'd been shot.

52
00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.285
You go into the restaurant business

53
00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:39.410
because people are always
going to have to eat.

54
00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:44.708
That was the day I realized my destiny lay
in fulfilling another basic human need.

55
00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:51.001
The next sabbath,
I went to temple with my father.

56
00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:54.509
However, it wasn't God
I was trying to get close to.

57
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.806
Eli, my oldest son Yuri.

58
00:07:56.893 --> 00:08:01.512
My contact at synagogue landed me
my first Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns.

59
00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.811
The first time you sell a gun
is a lot like the first time you have sex.

60
00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.615
You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing, but it is exciting,

61
00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:16.990
and one way or another,
it's over way too fast.

62
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.868
Gentlemen, the new Uzi machine pistol,

63
00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.748
big firepower in a small package.

64
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:29.923
This little baby uses 9mm hollowpoints,
20, 25-round extendable mags,

65
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.546
rear-flip adjustable sights.

66
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.676
Silencer comes standard.
Excellent recoil reduction.

67
00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:37.051
Muzzle jump reduced 40%,
60% improved noise suppression.

68
00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:39.884
You could pump a mag into me right now

69
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.761
and never wake the guy in the next room.

70
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.023
Of course, that would eliminate
your opportunity for repeat business.

71
00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:52.145
I did have a natural instinct
for smuggling contraband.

72
00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:56.616
Fortunately, back then a video camera
was as big as a bazooka.

73
00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.914
Here, I'd been running away from violence
my whole life,

74
00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.496
and I should have been running toward it.

75
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.544
It's in our nature.

76
00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:15.468
The earliest human skeletons
had spearheads in their ribcages.

77
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.438
Where have you been?
What if we had a customer?

78
00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.484
God bless America.

79
00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:48.660
Yeah?

80
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.717
"Beware of the dog"?

81
00:09:56.786 --> 00:09:58.866
You don't have a dog.
Are you trying to scare people?

82
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.551
No, it's to scare me.

83
00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.133
Remind me to beware of the dog in me.

84
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.810
The dog that wants
to fuck everything that moves,

85
00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:07.637
wants to fight and kill weaker dogs.

86
00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.891
I guess it's to remind me
to be more human.

87
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.192
Isn't being a dog part of being human?

88
00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:17.030
What if that's the best part of you,
the dog part?

89
00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:20.363
What if you're really
just a two-legged dog?

90
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.571
You need to see somebody.

91
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.327
It stinks in here.

92
00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.413
I'd always wanted to do something big
with my life.

93
00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.415
I Just didn't know what.

94
00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.756
Anyhow, I figured if I was going
into the gun trade,

95
00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.629
I was going to aim high.

96
00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:39.552
Vitaly, stop fucking around.
I want to talk to you.

97
00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.179
You read the newspapers, Vi?

98
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.728
The newspaper? It's always the same.

99
00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:52.057
You're right. Every day
there's people shooting each other.

100
00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.188
You know what I do when I see that?

101
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:58.022
I look to see what guns they're using,
and I think to myself, "why not my guns?"

102
00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.356
What, you opening a gun shop?

103
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.192
Already more of those
in America than McDonald's.

104
00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:06.121
Even with all the gangsters around here,
the margins are too low.

105
00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.414
-You've worked out the margins?
-Sure.

106
00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.201
Forget gang wars.

107
00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:14.917
The real money's in actual wars
between countries.

108
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:18.504
Yuri, what the fuck
do you know about guns?

109
00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:21.211
I know which end I'd rather be on.

110
00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:26.675
I made the first sale.
We're already in business.

111
00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:31.096
Whoa. We?

112
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:32.556
I need a partner.

113
00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:39.942
I don't know.
I don't know, Yuri. I don't know.

114
00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.866
Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht.
You're no fucking chef.

115
00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:46.035
I can eat in the restaurant for free
and I still don't eat there.

116
00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:47.282
Fuck you.

117
00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:49.284
We're doing nothing with our lives.

118
00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:55.787
I mean, this is shit. This is shit.

119
00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:58.418
That's true.

120
00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:02.881
But maybe doing nothing's better
than doing this.

121
00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:07.807
I need you.

122
00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:32.581
Sir, sir,

123
00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:36.878
may I interest you in the shoulder-fired
SA-7 surface-to-air missile?

124
00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.250
It's the older Chinese model.

125
00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.673
Not so effective
against modern military aircraft,

126
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.422
but deadly if used
against a commercial airliner.

127
00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.674
I'm giving them away at $850.

128
00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:50.429
It was the '80s, and the cold war
was far from thawed.

129
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.761
Most of the deals were
government to government.

130
00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:56.643
And it was a mostly private club
with a lifetime club president.

131
00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.814
-That's him.
-Who, the big shot?

132
00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.860
Simeon Weisz.

133
00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:05.611
Angola, Mozambique,
those Exocet missiles in the Falklands.

134
00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.364
He was selling guns
before there was gunpowder.

135
00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.828
I'll be right back.

136
00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:16.583
Mr. Weisz. Mr. Weisz.

137
00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:19.124
It's okay. They're talking.

138
00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.830
May I help? Yes.

139
00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:24.509
A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman,
from Brighton beach, import, exports,

140
00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:25.801
said to contact you.

141
00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:29.972
I have a business proposal
and I thought perhaps we could discuss it.

142
00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:32.971
I don't think you and I
are in the same business, son.

143
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.016
You think I just sell guns, don't you?

144
00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.889
I don't. I take sides.

145
00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:41.602
But in the Iran-Iraq war,
you sold guns to both sides.

146
00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:45.230
Did you ever consider
that I wanted both sides to lose?

147
00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.735
Bullets change governments
far surer than votes.

148
00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:55.036
You're in the wrong place, my young friend.
This is no place for amateurs.

149
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.840
Curious how you always revert
to your native tongue

150
00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:04.545
in moments of extreme anger

151
00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:06.918
and ecstasy.

152
00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:22.608
Oh, you are beautiful.

153
00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:24.777
What's your name again?

154
00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:34.662
The only option for Vitaly and me
was under the counter gunrunning.

155
00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:40.411
I got my first break in Lebanon
after the suicide bombing.

156
00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:45.632
But I wasn't the only local kid
making good.

157
00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:54.224
When the United States leaves a war zone,
they generally don't take their munitions.

158
00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:57.681
It costs more to bring it back
than to buy new stock.

159
00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:01.723
So, we sell by the kilo.

160
00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:04.475
They're secondhand weapons,
but they're still okay.

161
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.697
-How many kilos would you like?
-5,000.

162
00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:12.616
I had a flair for languages.

163
00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.908
But I soon discovered
that what talks best is dollars,

164
00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:19.741
dinars, drachmas, rubles,
rupees and pounds-fucking-Sterling.

165
00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:22.994
Of course, the us army
got a piece of the action.

166
00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:26.502
Army salaries were no better
in the '80s than they are today.

167
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:29.584
And some of the brass,
like lieutenant colonel Southern,

168
00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.589
good to make your acquaintance.

169
00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:39.101
This is bullshit money, Vi.
This is small fucking potatoes.

170
00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:40.724
What do you want to do, go more legit?

171
00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:42.521
No, more illegal.

172
00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:46.359
What I would give right now
for a plate of cabbage and potatoes.

173
00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:15.546
It's not our fight.

174
00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:17.507
Vi, come on.

175
00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:20.726
Let's go. Come on.

176
00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.899
Selling guns is like
selling vacuum cleaners.

177
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.781
You make calls,
pound the pavement, take orders.

178
00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.113
I was an equal opportunity
merchant of death.

179
00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:42.995
I supplied every army
but the salvation army.

180
00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:48.503
I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.

181
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.671
I sold communist-made bullets to fascists.

182
00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:18.118
I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan
when they were fighting my fellow Soviets.

183
00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:20.573
I never sold to Osama Bin Laden.

184
00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:24.954
Not on any moral grounds.
Back then, he was always bouncing checks.

185
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.585
By the mid '80s,

186
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.798
my weapons were represented
in eight of the world's top 10 war zones.

187
00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:11.002
There's no problem leading a double life.

188
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.002
It's the triple and quadruple lives
that get you in the end.

189
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:18.382
Back then, I carried a French, British,
Israeli and Ukrainian passport

190
00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:21.964
and a student visa for the us.
But that's another story.

191
00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:26.268
I also packed six different briefcases,
depending on who I was that day

192
00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.516
and the region of the world I was visiting.

193
00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:35.524
Without operations like mine,

194
00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:39.984
it would be impossible for certain
countries to conduct a respectable war.

195
00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:44.450
I was able to navigate around
those inconvenient little arms embargoes.

196
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.701
There are three basic types of arms deal.

197
00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:49.534
White being legal, black being illegal

198
00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:52.416
and my personal favorite color, gray.

199
00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:55.130
Sometimes I made the deals so convoluted,

200
00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:57.959
it was hard for me to work out
if they were on the level.

201
00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:01.217
To keep authorities in the dark,
I often spoke in code.

202
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.302
Rocket launchers were "mothers,"
the rockets, "children."

203
00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:08.306
The AK-47 assault rifle
was the "angel king."

204
00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:09.762
It's Yuri.

205
00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:13.433
Yeah, well, yeah, Raoul...

206
00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:16.853
Raoul, the angel king will arrive tomorrow.

207
00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:20.148
Hallelujah to you, too. All right.

208
00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:22.699
The point is, if I've done my job right,

209
00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:26.655
an arms embargo should be practically
impossible to enforce.

210
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:32.001
What? Okay, just slow the fuck down.

211
00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:34.955
I can't understand you. What?

212
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:38.007
What do you mean, tipped off?
They know where we are?

213
00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.336
Well, where are they?
Well, how long have I got?

214
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.513
Not long? What does that mean? Shit.

215
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.340
-Do we try to lose them?
-On this?

216
00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:50.053
-Yuri, we have to get off this thing.
-No, no one's going anywhere. Slow.

217
00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.388
Dead slow. Buy me time.

218
00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:58.277
Yeah, it's Yuri. Get that fucking rag down!

219
00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:00.400
I need another handle for this tub.

220
00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:02.573
Something in our weight class.

221
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.494
You, over the side.
We're changing the name. Now!

222
00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.788
Yes, it's gotta check out.

223
00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:12.750
The way I looked at it, what's in a name?

224
00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:14.122
Have you got a shorter name?

225
00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:17.376
I'd often change the registration
of a ship or a plane.

226
00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:19.499
But never at such short notice.

227
00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.633
Damn, they're hauling.

228
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:29.551
What? "Kono."
How do you spell that? K-o-n-o.

229
00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:31.306
Okay, well, that's good. Kono.

230
00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:33.763
K-o-n-0.

231
00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.894
What are we flying? Dutch. Got it.

232
00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.725
Vi, get me a Dutch flag, would you?

233
00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:51.576
Faster or I'll send your ass in!

234
00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.032
Yuri, I don't have Dutch.

235
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:54.788
-What?
-I've got Belgium.

236
00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:55.919
What the fuck use is that?

237
00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:58.579
He's painting a name
registered in the fucking Netherlands.

238
00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:02.257
-I've got a French flag.
-So?

239
00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:05.302
Turn it sideways, it's Dutch.

240
00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:09.048
That's why you're my brother.

241
00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:34.206
All right, good.
Everybody look innocent now.

242
00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.044
They say every man has his price.

243
00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:48.178
But not every man gets it.

244
00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:51.132
Interpol agent Jack Valentine
couldn't be bought,

245
00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:52.717
at least not with money.

246
00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.974
For Jack, glory was the prize.

247
00:21:56.065 --> 00:21:58.602
Yeah, it's the Kono. It's not the Kristol.

248
00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:01.187
Kono. K-o-n-o.

249
00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:04.111
-It's clean, sir.
-It's clean?

250
00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:06.317
Sure doesn't look clean.

251
00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:07.898
I'm gonna go aboard.

252
00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:10.947
Phone in a sighting of the Kristol
south of Aruba.

253
00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:20.916
Even when I was up against
an overzealous agent,

254
00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:24.123
I had a number of methods
for discouraging a search.

255
00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:28.006
I routinely mislabeled
my arms shipments "farm machinery."

256
00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:30.930
And I have yet to meet
the lowly paid customs official

257
00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:33.883
who will open a container
marked "radioactive waste"

258
00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:36.264
to verify its contents.

259
00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:38.846
But my personal favorite
is the unique combination

260
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:42.104
of week-old potatoes and tropical heat.

261
00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:58.157
It smells.

262
00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:03.078
Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north.

263
00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:07.546
Most importantly, I kept a number
of intelligence people on the payroll

264
00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:10.844
to supply their colleagues
with counterintelligence.

265
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.137
Let's go.

266
00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:26.189
The second rule of gunrunning is,

267
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.317
always ensure you have a foolproof way
to get paid.

268
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:33.026
Preferably in advance,
ideally to an offshore account.

269
00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:35.990
That's why I chose my customers
so carefully.

270
00:23:36.123 --> 00:23:38.614
Say what you like
about warlords and dictators.

271
00:23:38.709 --> 00:23:41.371
They tend to have
a highly developed sense of order.

272
00:23:41.462 --> 00:23:43.669
They always pay their bills on time.

273
00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:06.687
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

274
00:24:17.563 --> 00:24:18.683
What the fuck are you doing?

275
00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:20.243
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

276
00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:27.291
No, Vi.

277
00:24:30.344 --> 00:24:31.550
Shit.

278
00:24:31.637 --> 00:24:34.970
The first and most important rule
of gunrunning

279
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:37.719
is never get shot
with your own merchandise.

280
00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:40.175
You okay?

281
00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:42.477
I think so.

282
00:24:42.773 --> 00:24:46.311
-So what do we do now?
-Let's celebrate.

283
00:25:04.253 --> 00:25:05.584
God.

284
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:12.883
That narco-guerrilla had his facts right.

285
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.382
After shipping it stateside,
the return on that blow

286
00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:17.383
netted me a healthy profit.

287
00:25:17.474 --> 00:25:20.557
It would have been even better,
except one kilo never made it back.

288
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.635
Vitaly.

289
00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:24.891
Vi.

290
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.023
To this day, I don't know what
Vitaly was running away from.

291
00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:33.945
Maybe just from Vitaly.

292
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.113
I found him 12 days, 2,000 miles
and 150 grams later

293
00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:40.785
in a Bolivian boarding house.

294
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:48.411
Of course, my dream girl
had gotten there before me.

295
00:25:55.512 --> 00:25:56.627
Vi.

296
00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:07.896
Come on.

297
00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:27.325
Yuri. It's my brother, Yuri.

298
00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:29.827
He's my big brother.

299
00:26:32.007 --> 00:26:33.292
What the fuck is that?

300
00:26:33.383 --> 00:26:36.170
Ukraine. I was young.

301
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:38.673
But I remember. Look.

302
00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:43.348
I start in Odessa, right?
And then I work my way to the Crimean.

303
00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:46.055
You're gonna be dead
before you fucking reach Kiev.

304
00:26:46.146 --> 00:26:48.432
-Come on, we're going home.
-You fuck!

305
00:26:48.524 --> 00:26:52.563
You fucking fuck! You fucking fuck!

306
00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:54.689
What the fuck is your problem?

307
00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:03.193
Come on, Vit.

308
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:07.573
It's so nice to be home.

309
00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:09.329
Yeah, we're... we're gonna get you home.

310
00:27:09.419 --> 00:27:10.875
Come on.

311
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.255
Get out of the car.

312
00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:29.724
Vitaly, I need you to get out of the car.

313
00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:33.815
I promised our parents.

314
00:27:35.362 --> 00:27:36.397
Please.

315
00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:38.979
Vitaly, you're gonna have a great time.
This is a top place.

316
00:27:39.074 --> 00:27:40.985
Two Ford models checked in last week.

317
00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:43.032
And that cute weathergirl's
been here since July.

318
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.327
Please, please.

319
00:27:46.123 --> 00:27:47.408
Please, Yuri.

320
00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:07.428
You're a good brother.

321
00:28:09.438 --> 00:28:10.438
Okay.

322
00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.934
-You're a good brother, Yuri.
-Okay, all right.

323
00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:16.483
-Good brother.
-All right, get out of the car. Okay.

324
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.816
Get out of the car.

325
00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:29.112
From then on, I was a one-man operation.

326
00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:32.496
I never understood what separated
the recreational drug user

327
00:28:32.586 --> 00:28:35.077
from the habitual, but
for the grace of god,

328
00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:38.756
it could have been me snorting
lines as long as the belt parkway.

329
00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:43.377
However, I wasn't entirely free
of the grip of addiction myself.

330
00:28:43.472 --> 00:28:46.339
There she was again. Ava Fontaine.

331
00:28:46.808 --> 00:28:49.515
In my neighborhood,
they say, "the good get out.”

332
00:28:49.603 --> 00:28:52.140
In our own ways,
we'd both conquered the world.

333
00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:11.662
You can't force someone
to fall in love with you.

334
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.207
But you can definitely improve your odds.

335
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.957
It cost me $20,000
to book her for a fake photo shoot.

336
00:29:18.048 --> 00:29:20.710
Another $12,000 to buy out the hotel.

337
00:30:03.552 --> 00:30:05.508
It's a popular hotel, huh?

338
00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:11.681
Ava Fontaine. Yuri Orlov.

339
00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:13.595
What brings you to St. Barts?

340
00:30:13.687 --> 00:30:16.224
Photo shoot. At least that was the plan.

341
00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:19.018
Guess the photographer
got stuck in Miami.

342
00:30:19.109 --> 00:30:21.725
Hurricane, though there's nothing
on the news.

343
00:30:22.404 --> 00:30:25.066
Those things can come out of nowhere.

344
00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:29.115
So, the job's been canceled,
and wouldn't you know it,

345
00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:31.318
there's no flight back to New York
until Tuesday.

346
00:30:31.413 --> 00:30:34.405
You can hitch a ride with me if you like.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

347
00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:38.409
Meanwhile, why don't I take your picture?

348
00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:40.994
In my experience,

349
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:44.798
some of the most successful relationships
are based on lies and deceit.

350
00:30:44.885 --> 00:30:46.796
Since that's where they
usually end up anyway,

351
00:30:46.887 --> 00:30:48.673
it's a logical place to start.

352
00:30:48.764 --> 00:30:50.925
Right there. Right there. Hold it.

353
00:30:51.016 --> 00:30:52.756
Oh, my god!

354
00:30:55.979 --> 00:30:59.437
I nearly went broke
trying to convince her I was anything but.

355
00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:04.647
I knew Ava was not the kind of woman
to be seduced by a ride in a private jet,

356
00:31:04.738 --> 00:31:06.478
unless you owned the jet.

357
00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:08.571
This is your plane?

358
00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:10.444
That is my name.

359
00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:11.866
Of course I was lying.

360
00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:15.537
The plane was a rental like the car
and even the suit I was standing in.

361
00:31:15.624 --> 00:31:18.536
At the last minute,
I bribed the crew for the paint job.

362
00:31:18.627 --> 00:31:20.743
Luckily by the time we landed,

363
00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:23.670
Ava wasn't looking anywhere
but in my eyes.

364
00:31:24.633 --> 00:31:26.464
I had no idea.

365
00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:29.585
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

366
00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:32.716
Don't apologize.
I put clothes on for a living.

367
00:31:32.808 --> 00:31:34.673
Well, at least you're not taking them off.

368
00:31:34.768 --> 00:31:37.635
I would be if half the photographers
had their way.

369
00:31:37.854 --> 00:31:39.560
What about you?

370
00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:42.890
I'm in transport.
International air freight mostly.

371
00:31:43.193 --> 00:31:44.558
Business is good.

372
00:31:46.238 --> 00:31:47.694
Where are you from?

373
00:31:47.781 --> 00:31:49.988
I was born in Ukraine
but I grew up in Brooklyn.

374
00:31:50.075 --> 00:31:52.066
-No.
-What, you, too?

375
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.650
Williamsburg.

376
00:31:57.165 --> 00:31:59.121
Well, here's to a hurricane.

377
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.542
Without it I never would have met you.

378
00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:06.288
This is no accident, is it, Yuri?

379
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.426
It feels like fate.

380
00:32:13.557 --> 00:32:15.388
I don't believe in fate.

381
00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:18.634
What do you believe in?

382
00:33:00.312 --> 00:33:02.143
Is that a view or is that a view?

383
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:03.970
That's a view.

384
00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:17.322
Thank you. Thank you all.

385
00:33:22.209 --> 00:33:23.369
Congratulations.

386
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.745
Thanks.

387
00:33:26.755 --> 00:33:30.168
Always remember, son,
there's something above you.

388
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.758
Sure, dad. A $40,000 crystal chandelier.

389
00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.554
Make yourselves at home.

390
00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:40.966
Go. Go!

391
00:33:55.242 --> 00:33:57.733
I'm sorry. Today must be tough.

392
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:02.575
Be nice to have a couple more guests
from my side of the family.

393
00:34:02.958 --> 00:34:04.823
I'm sure they're watching right now.

394
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.666
Thank you.

395
00:34:07.504 --> 00:34:10.621
But you don't believe that, Yuri.
Remember?

396
00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:17.711
I know you, Yuri.
I know you're not everything you seem.

397
00:34:19.391 --> 00:34:22.053
Don't worry. I won't ask
a lot of questions.

398
00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:24.635
I don't want to hear you lie.

399
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.311
You take risks.

400
00:34:27.816 --> 00:34:31.650
Just promise me you won't risk us.

401
00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:36.063
That's the trouble with falling in love
with a dream girl.

402
00:34:36.157 --> 00:34:38.614
They have a habit of becoming real.

403
00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:46.619
I've never been so glad to see Vitaly.

404
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.326
-So fucking beautiful!
-Oh!

405
00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:55.632
Brother, brother, thank you so much
for giving me such a beautiful sister.

406
00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:58.210
He was out of rehab and out of his mind.

407
00:34:58.305 --> 00:35:00.387
Dance! Dance! Dance! We have to dance!

408
00:35:00.473 --> 00:35:03.055
-All right, all right.
-It's a wedding. A celebration. To Yuri!

409
00:35:03.143 --> 00:35:05.475
But for once, he rescued me.

410
00:35:09.024 --> 00:35:10.980
I was still living way beyond my means.

411
00:35:11.067 --> 00:35:14.605
Mortgaged to the hilt,
using one credit card to pay off another.

412
00:35:14.696 --> 00:35:17.312
Anything to keep Ava
in the style to which she had,

413
00:35:17.407 --> 00:35:20.114
thanks largely to me, become accustomed.

414
00:35:20.201 --> 00:35:23.068
Ava. Ava, this is too much.

415
00:35:23.163 --> 00:35:24.619
Yuri likes to spoil you.

416
00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:27.288
Then suddenly,
all my Christmases came at once.

417
00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:32.460
That's my grandson!

418
00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:34.833
Yuri, don't you want to see
what your son is doing?

419
00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:37.040
Whoever said it's better
to give than receive

420
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:40.923
never got a Christmas present
like the one I got in 1991

421
00:35:41.014 --> 00:35:42.504
from Mikhail Gorbachev.

422
00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:45.636
-What the hell's the matter?
-It's over! It's over!

423
00:35:45.727 --> 00:35:47.638
-What's over?
-The cold-fucking-war!

424
00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:49.970
The Soviet-fucking-Union!
The evil-fucking-empire.

425
00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:52.477
Mikhail's saying no mas.
He's throwing in the towel.

426
00:35:52.567 --> 00:35:53.898
It's over!

427
00:35:57.489 --> 00:36:00.231
-Your son is walking.
-That's incredible, honey.

428
00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:08.246
At least there'll be religious freedom.

429
00:36:08.667 --> 00:36:10.328
Let's hope so.

430
00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:13.460
I think I'll go back for a visit.

431
00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:16.087
Do you stay in touch with uncle Dmitri?

432
00:36:19.761 --> 00:36:21.422
I'm not a fool, Yuri.

433
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.507
I don't think you're going to Odessa
to sell Pepsi-cola.

434
00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:32.971
Is this how you want to be remembered?

435
00:36:34.776 --> 00:36:38.985
I don't want to be remembered at all.
If I'm being remembered it means I'm dead.

436
00:36:40.657 --> 00:36:43.114
Merry fucking Christmas!

437
00:36:43.827 --> 00:36:45.488
Who is this, Vitaly?

438
00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:49.120
-I'm angel.
-Her name really is angel.

439
00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:51.789
She's a fairy.

440
00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:57.037
Let's put her on top of the Christmas tree.

441
00:36:57.132 --> 00:36:58.292
Come on.

442
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:05.428
-I love you!
-Come on.

443
00:37:05.515 --> 00:37:06.925
I love you all.

444
00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:10.801
Take this.

445
00:37:28.788 --> 00:37:30.619
I'm going back to Ukraine.

446
00:37:34.294 --> 00:37:35.875
I miss Odessa.

447
00:37:45.221 --> 00:37:47.428
-I miss you.
-I miss you.

448
00:37:50.518 --> 00:37:53.180
Be careful, Yuri. Those
things you sell kill.

449
00:37:55.899 --> 00:37:57.059
Inside.

450
00:38:00.028 --> 00:38:01.643
You're high.

451
00:38:02.781 --> 00:38:04.362
Well, it's true.

452
00:38:07.535 --> 00:38:09.196
Hello, Christian.

453
00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:20.120
During the cold war the red army
stationed nearly one million troops

454
00:38:20.215 --> 00:38:23.673
in Ukraine because of its
strategic military importance.

455
00:38:24.177 --> 00:38:27.669
The day after the wall came down
the paychecks stopped coming.

456
00:38:29.432 --> 00:38:32.014
There's nothing better for an arms dealer
than the combination

457
00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:35.639
of disgruntled soldiers
and warehouses full of weapons.

458
00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:41.149
I was hoping Major General Dmitri Volkoff

459
00:38:41.236 --> 00:38:44.899
would open a lot of armory doors
in a lot of military bases.

460
00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:49.607
He was a highly decorated hero
of the red army

461
00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:52.159
and he was almost permanently shit-faced.

462
00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:55.614
I can't just sell you
government property, Yuri.

463
00:38:57.418 --> 00:38:59.158
I have to report.

464
00:38:59.254 --> 00:39:01.586
Report to who? Moscow?

465
00:39:04.384 --> 00:39:07.000
As of last week,
Moscow's in a foreign country.

466
00:39:07.095 --> 00:39:08.460
New flag, new boss.

467
00:39:08.555 --> 00:39:10.386
There is no new boss yet.

468
00:39:10.473 --> 00:39:12.009
They're all too busy squabbling

469
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.684
over who's gonna get the presidential
holiday home at the black sea.

470
00:39:16.437 --> 00:39:18.018
It's beautiful.

471
00:39:18.106 --> 00:39:21.894
The ones who know don't care anymore
and the ones who care don't know.

472
00:39:26.114 --> 00:39:27.479
Show me your inventory.

473
00:39:38.668 --> 00:39:42.206
Those 45 years of mutual hatred
between the east and the west

474
00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:45.380
had generated the highest
weapons buildup in history.

475
00:39:45.466 --> 00:39:48.424
The Soviets had guns
coming out of the demon hole.

476
00:39:48.511 --> 00:39:51.719
Huge stockpiles, and now no enemy.

477
00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:54.840
How many Kalashnikovs do you have?

478
00:39:57.312 --> 00:39:58.802
Forty thousand.

479
00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:00.929
Is that a four?

480
00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:04.269
Doesn't look like a four to me.
Looks more like a one.

481
00:40:05.194 --> 00:40:06.309
No, it's a four.

482
00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:10.613
It's whatever we say it is because
no one else will know the difference.

483
00:40:13.036 --> 00:40:15.948
Ten thousand Kalashnikovs for a battalion.

484
00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:19.535
Your stocks
are dangerously depleted, Dmitri.

485
00:40:20.168 --> 00:40:22.580
You should order more from the factory.

486
00:40:22.921 --> 00:40:24.832
Someone will work it out.

487
00:40:26.466 --> 00:40:27.706
What happens then?

488
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.381
We'll cut them in.

489
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:36.218
The end of the cold war was the beginning
of the hottest time in arms dealing.

490
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:38.425
The arms bazaar was open.

491
00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:41.310
Guided missiles, unguided missiles,

492
00:40:41.397 --> 00:40:44.480
mortars, mines, armored personnel carriers.

493
00:40:44.567 --> 00:40:46.057
Whole tank divisions.

494
00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:54.740
I even landed a squadron
of helicopter gunships.

495
00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:09.919
The most sophisticated fighting machines,

496
00:41:10.009 --> 00:41:12.796
built for a war with America
that never happened.

497
00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:22.010
Thanks to me,
they'd finally get to fire a shot in anger.

498
00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:34.148
I have a feeling it wasn't exactly
what comrade Lenin had in mind

499
00:41:34.242 --> 00:41:37.359
when he advocated
the redistribution of wealth.

500
00:41:37.453 --> 00:41:41.537
But I wasn't the only one
offering a crash course in capitalism.

501
00:41:43.292 --> 00:41:44.873
I had rivals.

502
00:41:45.378 --> 00:41:49.121
Inform your commanding officer
that simeon Weisz is here to meet him.

503
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.796
You don't know who I am, do you?

504
00:42:06.274 --> 00:42:07.639
You're late.

505
00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:10.190
So it appears.

506
00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:43.091
You look a little lost, simeon.
Is the world changing too fast?

507
00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:45.385
I'm here, aren't I?

508
00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.220
Not all of you, I think.

509
00:42:47.315 --> 00:42:49.852
You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA

510
00:42:49.942 --> 00:42:52.900
you can't seem to get that ideology
completely out of your head.

511
00:42:52.987 --> 00:42:55.069
Oh, the cold war had its uses.

512
00:42:56.115 --> 00:42:57.980
Kept the tensions frozen.

513
00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:02.861
Now it's harder to determine
which side one's on.

514
00:43:02.955 --> 00:43:04.820
Things have become more complicated.

515
00:43:04.916 --> 00:43:06.622
No, it's gotten simpler.

516
00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:10.368
There's no place in gunrunning
for politics anymore, simeon.

517
00:43:10.505 --> 00:43:12.837
I sell to leftists and rightists.

518
00:43:12.924 --> 00:43:16.792
I'd sell to pacifists but they're not
the most regular of customers.

519
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.085
Of course, you're not a
true internationalist

520
00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.887
until you've supplied weapons
to kill your own countrymen.

521
00:43:24.477 --> 00:43:27.969
This current state of chaos
won't last forever.

522
00:43:29.357 --> 00:43:31.188
There'll have to be order.

523
00:43:33.528 --> 00:43:38.113
Instead of cutting each other's throats,
it may be beneficial if we work together.

524
00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:39.359
What do you think?

525
00:43:42.411 --> 00:43:44.026
What do I think?

526
00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:47.079
I think you're the amateur now.

527
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:49.744
I think you should go with your instincts.

528
00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:51.542
With your first instinct.

529
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:54.788
I'm the same man who was not
good enough for you before

530
00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:58.215
and I'm just not good enough for you now.

531
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.392
The problem with gunrunners going to war

532
00:44:16.612 --> 00:44:19.570
is that there's no shortage of ammunition.

533
00:44:21.993 --> 00:44:25.656
This was the chaos
that the old guard had always feared.

534
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.698
As far as they were concerned,
I was giving arms dealers a bad name.

535
00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:33.455
But then they could hardly report me
to the better business bureau.

536
00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:37.379
And Ukraine wasn't the only former state

537
00:44:37.466 --> 00:44:40.299
with an unpaid army
and stockpiles of guns.

538
00:44:40.553 --> 00:44:45.263
There was Bulgaria, Hungary,
Poland, Belarus,

539
00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:47.552
all there for the taking.

540
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:54.514
Of all the weapons
in the vast Soviet arsenal,

541
00:44:54.609 --> 00:44:58.022
nothing was more profitable
than Avtomat Kalashnikova,

542
00:44:58.112 --> 00:44:59.852
model of 1947,

543
00:44:59.947 --> 00:45:03.986
more commonly known
as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov.

544
00:45:04.076 --> 00:45:07.034
It's the world's most popular assault rife.

545
00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:09.157
A weapon all fighters love.

546
00:45:09.248 --> 00:45:11.705
An elegantly simple
nine-pound amalgamation

547
00:45:11.792 --> 00:45:13.578
of forged steel and plywood.

548
00:45:13.669 --> 00:45:16.285
It doesn't break, jam, or overheat.

549
00:45:16.422 --> 00:45:19.755
It will shoot whether it's covered in mud
or filled with sand.

550
00:45:19.842 --> 00:45:23.460
It's so easy, even a child can use it,
and they do.

551
00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:25.545
The Soviets put the gun on a coin.

552
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.926
Mozambique put it on their flag.

553
00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:29.632
Since the end of the cold war

554
00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:33.390
the Kalashnikov has become
the Russian people's greatest export.

555
00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:37.144
After that comes vodka, caviar
and suicidal novelists.

556
00:45:37.818 --> 00:45:41.811
One thing's for sure.
No one was lining up to buy their cars.

557
00:46:12.812 --> 00:46:15.332
I thought you were supposed to be
watching out for these people.

558
00:46:15.356 --> 00:46:18.314
How can I?
You keep selling my helicopters.

559
00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:20.187
You are too greedy, Yuri.

560
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:22.192
I can't hold him forever.

561
00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.113
-I've got paperwork.
-Not for the gunships.

562
00:46:25.199 --> 00:46:27.906
You know the penalty for sanction-busting.

563
00:46:27.994 --> 00:46:31.031
Selling the military helicopter
is a major violation.

564
00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:33.238
Military helicopter.

565
00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:38.997
It's not a military helicopter.

566
00:46:39.088 --> 00:46:41.420
It's a rescue helicopter.

567
00:46:41.507 --> 00:46:43.213
Get to work, son.

568
00:46:46.095 --> 00:46:47.881
The law is on our side.

569
00:47:07.533 --> 00:47:09.273
All right, let me see your papers.

570
00:47:10.328 --> 00:47:12.944
No, no, put that away.
Let's see your papers.

571
00:47:13.039 --> 00:47:15.530
-Yuri Orlov.
-Mr. Orlov.

572
00:47:15.624 --> 00:47:17.580
Always in the wrong place
at the right time.

573
00:47:20.713 --> 00:47:23.625
We've met before.
Off the coast of Columbia.

574
00:47:23.758 --> 00:47:25.878
What was the name of that freighter?
I can't remember.

575
00:47:25.902 --> 00:47:28.550
Was it Kono or the Kristol?

576
00:47:28.637 --> 00:47:33.131
The crew called that vessel a lot of names,
none of them repeatable in polite company.

577
00:47:33.225 --> 00:47:36.262
-Answer the question.
-The new mp-5.

578
00:47:37.063 --> 00:47:38.769
Would you like a silencer for that?

579
00:47:38.856 --> 00:47:40.562
I need to see your papers.

580
00:47:43.277 --> 00:47:44.483
Dmitri!

581
00:47:48.783 --> 00:47:53.368
The end-user certificate for this aircraft
states Burkina Faso.

582
00:47:53.746 --> 00:47:56.704
Nice. Very nice.
Did you type this up yourself?

583
00:47:56.791 --> 00:47:59.328
The helicopter is to be used
on humanitarian missions.

584
00:47:59.418 --> 00:48:02.410
-So, you're a humanitarian?
-Absolutely.

585
00:48:03.464 --> 00:48:05.125
This is a military aircraft.

586
00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:07.207
-Not anymore.
-Listen to the nephew.

587
00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:11.135
What can they do with military hardware
but convert it to civilian use?

588
00:48:11.764 --> 00:48:15.723
The only way you could die from this baby
now is if a food drop hits you.

589
00:48:17.978 --> 00:48:21.061
And this stuff over here?
Is that going to Burkina Faso as well?

590
00:48:21.148 --> 00:48:23.309
But to a different client
at a different address.

591
00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:24.921
That's just a coincidence, is that it?

592
00:48:24.985 --> 00:48:27.692
Do you take me
for a complete fucking fool?

593
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.068
Not complete, sir.
And while I hesitate to tell you your job,

594
00:48:31.158 --> 00:48:33.774
I must point out
that when shipped separately

595
00:48:33.869 --> 00:48:35.700
the weapons and the aircraft both comply

596
00:48:35.788 --> 00:48:37.988
with the current Interpol
trade standards and practices.

597
00:48:38.012 --> 00:48:41.582
We both know that is an obscene
bureaucratic loophole

598
00:48:41.669 --> 00:48:43.830
that's gonna be closed any goddamn day.

599
00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:45.411
But it's not closed.

600
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:49.128
And while certain people
might interpret this cargo as suspicious,

601
00:48:49.218 --> 00:48:50.458
thank god we live in a world

602
00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:52.839
where suspicion alone
does not constitute a crime.

603
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.592
And where men like you
respect the rule of law.

604
00:49:00.688 --> 00:49:04.021
I was as guilty as sin,
but Valentine couldn't prove it.

605
00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:06.815
And he was the rarest breed
of law enforcement officer.

606
00:49:06.902 --> 00:49:11.020
The type who knew I was breaking the law
but wouldn't break it himself to bust me.

607
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:17.947
Valentine wasn't the only one
trying to put me out of business.

608
00:49:18.038 --> 00:49:20.950
My uncle had turned down
a half dozen rival arms dealers.

609
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:23.373
Sometimes with offers better than mine.

610
00:49:23.586 --> 00:49:26.498
But to Dmitri,
you couldn't put a price on loyally.

611
00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:42.847
-What was he doing here?
-He is hoping to beat your offer.

612
00:49:42.938 --> 00:49:46.351
I told him
to go have intercourse with himself.

613
00:49:46.442 --> 00:49:49.309
-But Yuri...
-You need to make more payoffs.

614
00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:50.984
-Too many know.
-Don't worry.

615
00:49:51.071 --> 00:49:54.438
There are more VCRs, cigarettes.
I left them in your new car.

616
00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:57.859
Even your enemy was admiring that car.

617
00:50:01.749 --> 00:50:05.082
I am the luckiest man alive.
You are.

618
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:45.827
-Hello?
-Ava?

619
00:50:45.918 --> 00:50:47.408
Hi, baby.

620
00:50:48.462 --> 00:50:50.248
You forgot what time it is?

621
00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:52.705
I'm sorry, I...

622
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.837
How was that... your audition?

623
00:50:56.637 --> 00:50:58.548
They're going in another direction.

624
00:50:58.639 --> 00:51:00.504
Direction of someone who can act.

625
00:51:00.975 --> 00:51:02.181
They don't deserve you.

626
00:51:04.311 --> 00:51:07.678
Where are you? Is everything okay?

627
00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:11.474
It was a rough day at the office.

628
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:13.901
-Come home.
-Soon.

629
00:51:13.988 --> 00:51:17.822
-How's Nicki?
-He misses you. We both do.

630
00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:21.150
It's lonely without you here.

631
00:51:21.537 --> 00:51:24.028
You know I don't like nights.

632
00:51:24.123 --> 00:51:25.988
Ever since my parents...

633
00:51:34.216 --> 00:51:37.049
-Yuri, what's that?
-A party.

634
00:51:37.136 --> 00:51:40.094
I better go.
Just wanted to call and hear your voice.

635
00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.341
-Kiss Nicki for me.
-I love you.

636
00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:48.260
The pillaging didn't die with my uncle.

637
00:51:49.023 --> 00:51:50.763
After the wall came down,

638
00:51:50.858 --> 00:51:55.852
$32 billion worth of arms were stolen
and resold from Ukraine alone.

639
00:51:56.196 --> 00:51:59.188
One of the greatest heists
of the 20th century.

640
00:52:13.005 --> 00:52:14.916
The primary market was Africa.

641
00:52:15.257 --> 00:52:18.294
Eleven major conflicts
involving 32 countries

642
00:52:18.385 --> 00:52:21.127
in less than a decade.
A gunrunner's wet dream.

643
00:52:21.221 --> 00:52:23.462
At the time, the west couldn't care less.

644
00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:26.549
They had a white war
in what was left of Yugoslavia.

645
00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:29.264
I did the bulk of my business in Liberia.

646
00:52:29.355 --> 00:52:30.891
"Land of the free."

647
00:52:31.065 --> 00:52:34.649
Originally established as a homeland
for freed American slaves,

648
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:37.898
it's been enslaved by one dictator
or another ever since.

649
00:52:38.072 --> 00:52:41.314
The latest was American-educated
self-declared president,

650
00:52:41.408 --> 00:52:43.194
Andre Baptiste.

651
00:52:48.248 --> 00:52:49.988
Mr. Yuri!

652
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.917
I'm Andre Baptiste Jr.

653
00:52:55.422 --> 00:52:57.253
My father would like to meet you.

654
00:52:57.341 --> 00:52:58.626
What an honor.

655
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.593
Thank him, but unfortunately
I have other business.

656
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.387
It's a shame. It's a very busy schedule.

657
00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:13.808
It is not,

658
00:53:14.441 --> 00:53:17.433
as they say, optional.

659
00:53:19.321 --> 00:53:21.937
My father is easily offended.

660
00:53:23.117 --> 00:53:25.108
My schedule just freed up.

661
00:53:27.204 --> 00:53:31.493
President Baptiste was my best customer
but I was in no hurry to meet him.

662
00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:34.450
He'd gotten a reputation
for routinely hacking off the limbs

663
00:53:34.545 --> 00:53:36.035
of those who opposed him.

664
00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.712
His seven year civil war
has been described as,

665
00:53:38.799 --> 00:53:42.291
"a relentless campaign
of sadistic, wanton violence."

666
00:53:42.636 --> 00:53:45.127
That kind of sums up Andy for me.

667
00:53:48.142 --> 00:53:49.848
The Glock is interesting.

668
00:53:51.145 --> 00:53:53.136
It's made of a polymer composite.

669
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.767
Many of my clients feel
they can get through airport security

670
00:53:55.858 --> 00:53:57.849
without setting off a lot of bells
and whistles.

671
00:53:57.943 --> 00:53:59.774
Personally, I do not recommend that.

672
00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:04.021
On the other hand, if you are looking
for a traditional wheel gun,

673
00:54:04.116 --> 00:54:07.028
there is no substitute
for the six inches of muzzle energy

674
00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:10.828
of the .357 Magnum.
And of course, it will never jam.

675
00:54:13.709 --> 00:54:15.290
Why'd you do that?

676
00:54:15.377 --> 00:54:16.617
What did you say?

677
00:54:18.505 --> 00:54:21.838
Well, now you're gonna have to buy it.
It's a used gun.

678
00:54:23.719 --> 00:54:25.550
How can I sell a used gun?

679
00:54:28.015 --> 00:54:29.471
A used gun.

680
00:54:30.517 --> 00:54:31.848
A used gun?

681
00:54:33.687 --> 00:54:35.177
That's a good one.

682
00:54:37.816 --> 00:54:41.684
You know, there is no discipline
with the youth today.

683
00:54:41.779 --> 00:54:44.691
I try to set an example
but it is difficult.

684
00:54:46.325 --> 00:54:48.361
Personally, I blame MTV.

685
00:54:52.748 --> 00:54:54.204
A used gun.

686
00:54:58.545 --> 00:55:02.584
I think you and I, we can do business.

687
00:55:04.426 --> 00:55:08.886
If I thought I was scared of Andre Sr.,
I knew I was scared of Andre Jr.

688
00:55:09.807 --> 00:55:11.672
Like father like son.

689
00:55:11.767 --> 00:55:14.725
The guava doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

690
00:55:14.895 --> 00:55:16.635
He was also a cannibal.

691
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:19.893
They say Andre would eat a victim's heart
while it was still beating

692
00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:22.190
to give him superhuman strength.

693
00:55:29.368 --> 00:55:32.405
Monrovia itself
was like being on another planet.

694
00:55:32.955 --> 00:55:34.786
Planet Monrovia.

695
00:55:34.873 --> 00:55:38.411
From the temperature,
it was obviously a planet close to the sun.

696
00:55:39.419 --> 00:55:43.037
I rarely saw another white man,
and I never left town alone.

697
00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:47.587
Outside town was the edge of hell.
I didn't want to even gaze info it.

698
00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:50.294
This is your hotel.

699
00:55:50.889 --> 00:55:52.299
Two stars.

700
00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:55.723
Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?

701
00:55:55.811 --> 00:55:57.847
Part one, two or three?

702
00:55:57.938 --> 00:56:00.600
-I've only seen part one.
-The M60.

703
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:02.602
Would you like the armor piercing bullets?

704
00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:04.058
Please.

705
00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:08.146
My father left a welcoming
present in your room.

706
00:56:08.907 --> 00:56:10.272
Enjoy.

707
00:56:24.798 --> 00:56:28.791
My god, she nearly got her head cut off.

708
00:56:30.137 --> 00:56:34.301
When I get to America,
I will not live in Brentwood.

709
00:56:35.434 --> 00:56:36.719
Second floor.

710
00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:44.355
In the most aids infested region
of the globe,

711
00:56:44.443 --> 00:56:46.650
where one in four is infected,

712
00:56:46.737 --> 00:56:48.068
Andre's idea of a joke

713
00:56:48.155 --> 00:56:51.113
was to put a young iman
and a young Naomi in my bed

714
00:56:51.325 --> 00:56:53.611
and no condom within a hundred miles.

715
00:57:08.634 --> 00:57:09.999
Hello, Mr. Yuri.

716
00:57:11.345 --> 00:57:12.505
Hi.

717
00:57:12.846 --> 00:57:15.007
We'd be happy to make you happy.

718
00:57:17.559 --> 00:57:18.799
I can't.

719
00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:22.519
I'd love to, but I can't.

720
00:57:23.065 --> 00:57:26.353
Don't worry. We don't have anything.

721
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:33.071
How do you know?

722
00:57:35.535 --> 00:57:37.150
Do we look like it?

723
00:57:37.537 --> 00:57:40.324
What if I have aids? Don't you worry?

724
00:57:41.959 --> 00:57:43.620
You worry too much.

725
00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:48.374
Why do you worry about something
that can kill you in 10 years,

726
00:57:48.966 --> 00:57:52.379
when there's so many things
that can kill you today?

727
00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:56.090
Now,

728
00:57:58.433 --> 00:58:00.515
how can we make you happy?

729
00:58:03.563 --> 00:58:04.678
By leaving.

730
00:58:09.778 --> 00:58:12.565
These are my Kalashnikov kids,

731
00:58:13.198 --> 00:58:14.938
my boy brigades.

732
00:58:16.702 --> 00:58:20.911
I can see what you are thinking,
but we need every man we can get.

733
00:58:21.123 --> 00:58:22.784
Even if they're not men?

734
00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:26.033
A bullet from a 14-year-old
is just as effective

735
00:58:26.128 --> 00:58:27.993
as one from a 40-year-old.

736
00:58:28.922 --> 00:58:30.662
Often more effective.

737
00:58:34.011 --> 00:58:36.468
No one can stop this bath of blood.

738
00:58:36.596 --> 00:58:39.053
It's not bath of blood, it's bloodbath.

739
00:58:40.517 --> 00:58:41.677
Thank you,

740
00:58:42.561 --> 00:58:44.426
but I prefer it my way.

741
00:58:57.117 --> 00:59:00.860
I am not going to pay your asking price.
We are not a rich people.

742
00:59:00.954 --> 00:59:04.947
And besides, the market is already flooded
with your Kalashnikovs.

743
00:59:05.125 --> 00:59:09.038
Do you realize in some parts of my country
you can get one for the price of a chicken?

744
00:59:09.129 --> 00:59:12.417
But you can't just look at the unit price.
You forget ancillary costs.

745
00:59:12.507 --> 00:59:14.964
End-user certificates
need to be forged and notarized.

746
00:59:15.052 --> 00:59:18.260
Shell companies set up, insurance
purchased, pilots and crews hired.

747
00:59:18.346 --> 00:59:20.086
Not to mention the bribes.

748
00:59:20.307 --> 00:59:23.219
You can't get a nut and bolt
out of the eastern bloc without a bribe.

749
00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:26.393
There's one bribe for the nut,
another for the bolt.

750
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.813
Andy, Andy, listen to me.
This is an expensive proposition.

751
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:31.265
Andy?

752
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.312
I am going to pay you in timber.

753
00:59:38.825 --> 00:59:40.156
Or stones.

754
00:59:43.121 --> 00:59:44.406
Well, I'll take the stones.

755
00:59:44.498 --> 00:59:47.786
It's kind of hard to get a tree trunk
into my hand luggage.

756
00:59:48.835 --> 00:59:51.121
I know you're planning a new offensive.

757
00:59:51.213 --> 00:59:54.876
If you can delay a week
I can get you armored personnel carriers.

758
00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:58.007
They'd greatly reduce your casualties

759
00:59:58.136 --> 01:00:00.343
and give you
a significant strategic advantage.

760
01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:05.298
You know, they call me the lord of war,

761
01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:07.634
but perhaps it is you.

762
01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:11.438
It's not lord of war. It's warlord.

763
01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.559
Thank you, but I prefer it my way.

764
01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:22.733
Conflict diamonds
are a common currency in west Africa.

765
01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:24.864
Also referred to as blood diamonds,

766
01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.697
since bloodshed
is what they generally finance.

767
01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:32.751
By the late '90s, my wealth had caught up
to my lies about my wealth.

768
01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:34.920
Even surpassed my lies.

769
01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:37.918
I could even afford
to become a patron of the arts.

770
01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.466
I can't believe it.

771
01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:52.062
Well, of course it's wonderful. I just...

772
01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:54.689
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

773
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:59.607
Yes, well, that...
Well, that would be great, too, yeah.

774
01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.241
It's wonderful. Thank you so much.

775
01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:07.319
It's... Yuri. Okay, thank you. Bye.

776
01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:11.123
Yuri, that was the dealer on the phone.
I just sold my first painting.

777
01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:12.824
That's fantastic! Yes!

778
01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:18.380
Someone important.
They wanna remain anonymous.

779
01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.627
-This is so wonderful.
-Yeah, how was your trip?

780
01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:22.926
You know, same old, same old.
Where's Nicki?

781
01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.550
Oh, in bed. I'm sorry. He couldn't stay up.

782
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.675
Well, that's best.

783
01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:29.974
My first painting. I'm
officially an artist!

784
01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.560
This calls for a drink.
“What doesn't?

785
01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:35.441
Hi.

786
01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:38.767
-Yuri, this is...
-Candy.

787
01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:40.943
-Candy, of course.
-Hi.

788
01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.442
Any friend of my brother's

789
01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:45.982
is a friend of my brother's.

790
01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:49.114
You have a beautiful everything.

791
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:52.372
Yes, he does.

792
01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:53.824
Yes, I do.

793
01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:56.285
-I'm gonna kiss Nicki good night.
-Okay.

794
01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:52.841
How are you, brother?

795
01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:56.679
Oh, you know,
still the resident family fuck up.

796
01:02:57.524 --> 01:03:01.767
Yeah, well, I guess someone has to do it.
Yeah.

797
01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:06.779
Hey, Ava knows, right?

798
01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:14.370
I never want to say anything.

799
01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:17.120
She doesn't have to know.
She understands.

800
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.201
She's a survivor, like me.

801
01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:23.171
Well, she may be a survivor
but she's not like you.

802
01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:28.589
Really, she doesn't know
how you pay for all this?

803
01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.295
We don't talk about it.

804
01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:34.224
How many car salesmen
talk about their work, huh?

805
01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:35.762
How many cigarette salesmen?

806
01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:38.220
Both their products
kill more people every year than mine.

807
01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.806
At least mine has a safety switch.

808
01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:45.444
If those guys can leave their
work at the office, so can I.

809
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.152
Goddamn, you are good.

810
01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:53.777
You really are.

811
01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.951
You almost had me convinced.

812
01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:09.091
Could you...

813
01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:14.264
Could you help me out with some...

814
01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:21.433
Why?

815
01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:24.770
Why?

816
01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:27.436
Why?

817
01:04:28.656 --> 01:04:30.237
Why what?

818
01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:33.700
-Why, why, why, why?
-I don't know. I don't know.

819
01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:35.027
Why what?

820
01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:38.655
Why are you so fucked up all the time?

821
01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:46.121
Because I am.

822
01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:00.928
I didn't know how much Ava really knew
and how much she ignored.

823
01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.896
She never questioned
how a guy in the transport business

824
01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:06.816
could afford to give her
18-karat diamond earrings.

825
01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.278
I guess she didn't really want
to hear the answer.

826
01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:13.444
Mostly, she seemed content
that I was a good provider

827
01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:16.277
and as far as she was concerned, loyal.

828
01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.077
Despite the other women,

829
01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:21.531
I always made love to Ava
as if she was the only one.

830
01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:27.169
I'm not saying I didn't have setbacks.

831
01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:31.250
It's not called gunrunning for nothing.
You gotta be fast on your feet.

832
01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:34.381
Some revolutions blow over
before the guns even get there.

833
01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:37.635
There's nothing more expensive
for an arms dealer than peace.

834
01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:41.718
Truce? What do you mean truce?
The guns are already on their way.

835
01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.599
Peace talks.

836
01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:48.441
All right, forget it.
I'll reroute the shipment to the Balkans.

837
01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:51.486
When they say they're gonna have a war,
they keep their word.

838
01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:02.997
Of course, a new breed of gunrunner
requires a new breed of cop.

839
01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:09.917
Henry, take park Avenue.

840
01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.350
Take them on a tour of New Jersey.

841
01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:08.813
Yuri, there are men
going through our garbage cans.

842
01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:13.018
It's probably just some reporters
looking for somebody else.

843
01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:15.945
I have a feeling
they don't work for the tabloids.

844
01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:18.823
Yuri,

845
01:07:20.912 --> 01:07:22.948
is there anything
I should be worried about?

846
01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.076
No, nothing.

847
01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.291
-Nothing.
-I love you.

848
01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:31.127
I love you, too.

849
01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:36.923
Sir.

850
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:27.387
I was now the best merchant of death alive.

851
01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.764
I didn't own my own plane. I owned a fleet.

852
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:34.933
Running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone
or the Ivory Coast at least once a week.

853
01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:37.360
Most trips, I had phony paperwork.

854
01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.984
If the deadline was tight
and I had to cut corners,

855
01:08:40.074 --> 01:08:42.030
I had no paperwork at all.

856
01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:46.243
But I wasn't overly concerned.

857
01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:48.492
There was hardly any radar
over most of Africa,

858
01:08:48.583 --> 01:08:50.244
and even fewer people to watch it.

859
01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.546
Charlie, echo, India.

860
01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:01.718
Reroute to Kabala airport on heading 0-2-9.

861
01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.214
Comply immediately.

862
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:19.670
Colonel Southern, it's Yuri.
I'm sorry to call you on this number,

863
01:09:19.739 --> 01:09:21.354
but I've got Interpol all over my ass.

864
01:09:21.449 --> 01:09:25.067
I can't know you right now.
It's not a good time.

865
01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:28.570
Not a good time?

866
01:09:37.757 --> 01:09:42.000
Charlie, echo, India, comply immediately.
This is your last warning.

867
01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:43.530
Where was the first fucking warning?

868
01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:45.340
Rock your wings if you intend to comply.

869
01:09:45.431 --> 01:09:46.921
I'm putting us down.

870
01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:54.516
If you land, we're all going away.
I don't have paperwork.

871
01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.527
-We're in a flying fucking bomb.
-They're firing bullets at our bullets.

872
01:09:57.610 --> 01:10:01.194
-I'm putting us down.
-Okay, okay, fuck!

873
01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:03.776
This is Charlie, echo, India.

874
01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:07.233
Request reroute to Kabala airport
on bearing 0-2-9.

875
01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:11.533
No, not the airport.
There, the highway. It's our only hope.

876
01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:14.700
Are you fucking mad?
A pothole will set us off.

877
01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:17.000
You underestimate yourself, Aleksei.

878
01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:19.795
You're the best. You're the shit, Aleksei.
You're the shit!

879
01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:22.043
You're the shit! You're the shit!

880
01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:24.834
Of course, Aleksei wasn't the best.

881
01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:28.387
He'd come 42nd out of 43
at the Moscow flight school.

882
01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.222
Oh, god, what's he doing?

883
01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:40.433
Is this guy nuts?

884
01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:43.944
I can't land there, sir.

885
01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:46.818
Kabala's only 15 minutes away.
He can't get far.

886
01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:49.116
I want a truck on the tarmac.

887
01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:07.478
We're gonna be okay.

888
01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:12.400
-Where you going?
-As far from the evidence as we can get.

889
01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:14.577
Wait! There's not gonna be any evidence.

890
01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:32.094
Come here, come here.

891
01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:38.134
Hey, don't be shy. Here, look. Free sample.

892
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:41.096
Help yourself, okay? Free sample.
Tell your friends.

893
01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.308
Come here. You want something? Look.
Want an RPG? All for you, all right?

894
01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:49.396
Happy times. Come on. Help yourselves!
No charge. Everything goes.

895
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:52.448
Guns, guns, guns. Yeah, come on up!

896
01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.449
Here, having fun now, huh?

897
01:12:56.455 --> 01:13:00.039
Come on. Guns, guns, guns! Yeah!

898
01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:02.705
Bullets, guns, grenades.

899
01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:05.832
Hooray, yeah, take them all.
Take the whole crate.

900
01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:08.665
Go ahead, take the crate.
Everybody, come on.

901
01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.211
Guns, grenades, hooray!

902
01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:15.922
Bullets, guns, grenades!

903
01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.261
Yeah!

904
01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:19.892
That one's got your name on it.

905
01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.561
You want one, too? Come on.
We got bullets.

906
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:24.389
Don't forget the bullets.

907
01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:27.065
How can you shoot a gun
if you don't have bullets?

908
01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:29.144
Everything goes for free.

909
01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:32.362
Guns, grenades, RPGs,

910
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:34.816
bullets, guns, yeah!

911
01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:37.994
Hooray, hooray! Want some bullets?

912
01:13:38.623 --> 01:13:40.079
Gotta have bullets.

913
01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:43.415
What a cargo crew
at Heathrow airport does in a day,

914
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:47.378
took a bunch of malnourished
Sierra Leonean locals 10 minutes.

915
01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:50.957
By the time agent Valentine got there,

916
01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:53.794
you could find more guns
on a plane full of Quakers.

917
01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:02.514
Yuri Orlov.

918
01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:05.854
-Fuck!
-You run from us?

919
01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:08.015
No, Mbizi, no.

920
01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:09.858
Can he run with no legs?

921
01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:14.280
Let me make him disappear, Mr. Valentine.
Around here, people disappear all the time.

922
01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:15.447
I can't do that.

923
01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:17.525
Look where we are. Who will know?

924
01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:21.863
We will.

925
01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:30.705
He's gonna get what's coming to him.

926
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.960
I'm not as certain.

927
01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:42.429
All right, get up.

928
01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:49.728
-What's the charge?
-What are you doing in Sierra Leone?

929
01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.977
I'm on safari. Yeah?

930
01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:55.651
You're hunting wildebeests
with a submachine gun?

931
01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:57.732
Do you also work with the park service?

932
01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.909
Hunting without a license.
Is that the charge?

933
01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:03.580
Why are we playing games?
You traffic arms.

934
01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:05.702
-Trade.
-Trade, traffic.

935
01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:07.909
You get rich

936
01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:12.122
by giving the poorest people on the planet
the means to continue killing each other.

937
01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:13.877
Do you know why I do what I do?

938
01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:16.710
I mean, there are more
prestigious assignments.

939
01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:18.635
Keeping track of nuclear arsenals.

940
01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:22.056
You'd think that more critical
to world security, but it's not.

941
01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:24.304
No, nine out of 10 war victims today

942
01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:27.933
are killed with assault rifles
and small arms like yours.

943
01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:30.060
Those nuclear missiles,
they sit in their silos.

944
01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:33.939
Your AK-47, that is the real
weapon of mass destruction.

945
01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:37.438
I don't want people dead, agent Valentine.

946
01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:40.825
I don't put a gun to anybody's head
and make them shoot.

947
01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:43.527
I admit,
a shooting war's better for business,

948
01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:45.988
but I prefer people to fire my guns
and miss,

949
01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:47.823
just as long as they're firing.

950
01:15:57.261 --> 01:16:00.048
Can I go now? You've got nothing on me.

951
01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:02.463
Except cuffs.

952
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:08.432
Since you're so concerned with the law,
you must know

953
01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:12.640
that I'm legally permitted to hold you
for 24 hours without charging you.

954
01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:16.227
You might ask why I would do that,
and I can assure you

955
01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:19.530
it's not because I enjoy your company,
because I don't. No.

956
01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:24.532
The reason why I will delay you for
every second of the permissible 24 hours is

957
01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:28.781
I am delaying your deadly trade
and the deaths of your victims.

958
01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:32.744
I don't think of it as taking a day
from you, but giving a day to them.

959
01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:37.423
Some innocent man, woman or child
is going to have an extra day on this earth

960
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:39.171
because you're not free.

961
01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:42.837
So, I will see you

962
01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:45.510
in 23 hours

963
01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:47.683
and 55 minutes.

964
01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:57.565
Valentine knew he didn't have to guard me.
There was nowhere to go.

965
01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:01.356
Or maybe he was hoping
the locals would tear me apart.

966
01:17:01.826 --> 01:17:04.192
But they were too busy with the plane.

967
01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:10.327
It's like parking your car
in certain neighborhoods in the Bronx.

968
01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:12.454
You just don't do it.

969
01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:26.801
The way I look at it,
it's the way of Africa.

970
01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:28.557
Maybe life.

971
01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:32.557
Everything that comes from the earth
eventually returns.

972
01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:35.849
Even a 40-ton Antonov-12 cargo plane.

973
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:36.200
A gift for you.

974
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:40.917
You know, you've arrived just in time.

975
01:18:41.133 --> 01:18:44.717
I was afraid that he might die
before you got your chance

976
01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.503
to kill him.

977
01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.144
This man came here

978
01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:58.855
hoping to take your place.

979
01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:03.485
Is that not so?

980
01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:17.707
No, I'm not here to supply Mr. Baptiste.

981
01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:22.125
I am here to supply his enemies.

982
01:19:25.928 --> 01:19:28.419
I fear it's a sale I shall never complete.

983
01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:33.257
He killed your blood,

984
01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:35.968
your uncle,

985
01:19:36.563 --> 01:19:38.599
when he tried to kill you.

986
01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:49.698
-No.
-No?

987
01:19:52.997 --> 01:19:55.113
You want that I should let him go?

988
01:19:57.501 --> 01:20:00.834
No, I... "No, no, I..."

989
01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:05.377
You do want him dead.

990
01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:06.715
You just

991
01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:10.673
don't want to have to do it yourself.

992
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:17.350
So,

993
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:20.895
we will do this together.

994
01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:27.941
This will be

995
01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:31.740
a bonding experience.

996
01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:40.620
You know you can stop this
anytime that you want.

997
01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:42.750
But I don't think that you do.

998
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:44.540
Just say the word.

999
01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:48.753
Say "stop."

1000
01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:03.764
Stop.

1001
01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:16.318
I will get you another room, my friend.

1002
01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:19.325
With a much nicer view.

1003
01:21:52.366 --> 01:21:54.732
He ordered you brown-brown, Mr. Yuri.

1004
01:21:58.664 --> 01:22:00.780
-What?
-Brown-brown.

1005
01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:03.658
-What is it?
-It's a mixture of cocaine

1006
01:22:05.295 --> 01:22:06.785
and gunpowder.

1007
01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:10.122
They give it to the young boys
before they do battle.

1008
01:22:10.217 --> 01:22:11.798
They do anything.

1009
01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.343
Some other time.

1010
01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:18.881
I suggest you try it at
least once, Mr. Yuri.

1011
01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:21.015
Why?

1012
01:22:21.395 --> 01:22:23.977
Because it's your gunpowder.

1013
01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.203
All right.

1014
01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:47.955
Even before that night

1015
01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:50.788
I started doing a lot of cocaine
in west Africa.

1016
01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:53.673
I'd never tried brown-brown before.

1017
01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.046
But then I never killed a man, either.

1018
01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:01.719
Here we go. Come on!

1019
01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:23.078
Oh, I didn't do anything, did I?

1020
01:23:30.589 --> 01:23:33.331
Wait, are you sick? Sida?

1021
01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:35.339
Aids?

1022
01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:39.677
Ask the white man. He will know.

1023
01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:42.465
Sir, will my hand grow back?

1024
01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:53.896
-Simeon?
-Remember, Yuri.

1025
01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.228
Take sides.

1026
01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:00.741
Simeon!

1027
01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:05.700
Don't! He's Andre's.

1028
01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:08.874
-Fuck Andre.
-Yeah, fuck Andre.

1029
01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:14.250
I'm sorry, they don't usually do that.

1030
01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.879
Well, let me look at it.
Maybe I can fix it.

1031
01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:21.678
Let me see it. It's the magazine.
Give it to me.

1032
01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:24.715
Fuck you!

1033
01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:52.830
I started to feel I'd been cursed.

1034
01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:55.499
The curse of invincibility.

1035
01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:01.673
Nicki, please go to your room.

1036
01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:07.470
I don't believe you.

1037
01:25:08.312 --> 01:25:10.303
Can you prove any of this?

1038
01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:15.691
Mr. Orlov goes to a lot of trouble
to make his business look legitimate.

1039
01:25:16.194 --> 01:25:19.186
Even to you. Perhaps, especially to you.

1040
01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:22.739
I don't expect
we're gonna find anything here today.

1041
01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.650
So, what do you want?

1042
01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:28.869
I was hoping that you would help me.

1043
01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:37.996
I understand that

1044
01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:41.550
your parents died tragically.

1045
01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:49.099
The illegal firearms
used to murder your mother and father

1046
01:25:49.436 --> 01:25:52.269
were procured from men
exactly like your husband.

1047
01:25:55.025 --> 01:25:56.606
I'd like you to leave.

1048
01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:01.853
Okay. Gentlemen.

1049
01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:18.794
Ava?

1050
01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:29.923
Ava, what's wrong?

1051
01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:33.142
I can't wear the clothes.

1052
01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:36.222
I can't wear the jewelry.

1053
01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:39.607
Can't drive the car.

1054
01:26:41.822 --> 01:26:43.687
Can't live in this house.

1055
01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:45.940
Everything's got blood on it.

1056
01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.444
Blood on it?

1057
01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:51.574
What's the matter with you?

1058
01:26:55.627 --> 01:26:57.413
Don't be so melodramatic.

1059
01:26:57.504 --> 01:27:00.962
Of course I'm melodramatic.
I'm a failed actress, remember?

1060
01:27:09.975 --> 01:27:12.557
I told you, these people, it's political.

1061
01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:14.509
They lie. They're liars.

1062
01:27:14.688 --> 01:27:17.805
Look at me. Look. They lie
to make themselves look good, okay?

1063
01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.982
-You can't trust them.
-It's not just them.

1064
01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:27.155
Don't worry.
Your family didn't say anything.

1065
01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:29.566
They didn't have to.

1066
01:27:31.788 --> 01:27:35.997
I sell people a means
to defend themselves, Ava.

1067
01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:37.168
That's all.

1068
01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:40.540
Yuri, I see the news. I see those pictures.

1069
01:27:41.465 --> 01:27:42.825
The guns are bigger than the boys.

1070
01:27:42.849 --> 01:27:45.461
There is nothing illegal about what I do!

1071
01:27:45.552 --> 01:27:47.338
I don't care if it's legal!

1072
01:27:48.054 --> 01:27:49.169
It's wrong!

1073
01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:10.695
Please stop.

1074
01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:15.912
It makes no difference if I stop.

1075
01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:19.074
Someone will take my place the next day.

1076
01:28:19.169 --> 01:28:22.036
So let them. We have enough.

1077
01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:25.543
It's not about the money.

1078
01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:29.050
Then what is it?

1079
01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:34.927
I'm good at it.

1080
01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:48.570
I feel like all I've done my whole life
is be pretty.

1081
01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:50.780
I mean,

1082
01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.151
all I've done is be born.

1083
01:28:55.205 --> 01:28:58.743
I'm a failed actress, a failed artist.

1084
01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:01.540
I'm not much good as a mother.

1085
01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:07.293
Come to think of it,
I'm not even that pretty anymore.

1086
01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:13.883
I have failed at everything, Yuri.

1087
01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:18.596
But I won't fail as a human being.

1088
01:29:23.608 --> 01:29:27.100
My enemies had finally found a weapon
that could hurt me.

1089
01:29:28.738 --> 01:29:31.901
For the next six months I stopped
running guns. I went legitimate.

1090
01:29:31.992 --> 01:29:33.698
This is an untapped market.

1091
01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:37.744
I'm talking over five million cubic meters
of timber in the first year alone.

1092
01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:39.992
Over 100 exploitable species.

1093
01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:42.540
The oil? Between you and me,
this is the new Texas.

1094
01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:45.334
What do you say to 10,000 barrels a month?

1095
01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:47.370
He must be lying.

1096
01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:49.668
He's talking.

1097
01:29:49.759 --> 01:29:53.092
Listen, there are gas reserves off the
Ivory Coast that OPEC doesn't know about.

1098
01:29:53.179 --> 01:29:55.215
The phone numbers all check out.

1099
01:29:57.267 --> 01:29:58.803
It's all on the level.

1100
01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:01.885
No wonder Valentine was confused.

1101
01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:20.321
Thank god there are still legal ways
to exploit developing countries.

1102
01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:24.283
But the only problem with an honest buck
is they're so hard to make.

1103
01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:27.790
The margins are too low.
Too many people are doing it.

1104
01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:34.877
Still, I'd promised Ava.

1105
01:30:44.022 --> 01:30:46.764
Yuri, the president of Liberia
is on his way up.

1106
01:30:49.194 --> 01:30:50.274
He's early.

1107
01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:53.774
-I'll be back in a minute.
-Okay.

1108
01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:02.195
What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?

1109
01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.250
We are here for peace talks
at the united nations.

1110
01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:06.892
So at the same time you thought
you'd drop in on your arms dealer?

1111
01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:10.378
Well, I was beginning to wonder
whether that was still your profession.

1112
01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:12.919
You know you're a hard man
to get ahold of all of a sudden.

1113
01:31:13.885 --> 01:31:15.250
That is a shame.

1114
01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:18.795
My son and I,
we were hoping to do a little shopping

1115
01:31:19.349 --> 01:31:21.909
-while we are here in New York.
-You know they're watching you.

1116
01:31:21.933 --> 01:31:23.596
Yes, I know they blame me.

1117
01:31:23.687 --> 01:31:26.144
They blame me for everything,
those hypocrites.

1118
01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:29.143
-They're on a hunt for a witch.
-Witch-hunt.

1119
01:31:29.567 --> 01:31:31.432
Hostilities have escalated.

1120
01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:35.111
They are making it very difficult
for me to resupply.

1121
01:31:35.573 --> 01:31:40.067
That requires a man of your rare ingenuity.

1122
01:31:43.081 --> 01:31:44.571
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

1123
01:31:51.923 --> 01:31:53.254
I understand.

1124
01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:56.916
But you should know this.

1125
01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:59.760
Due to our present situation
we are compelled

1126
01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:02.463
to be unusually generous.

1127
01:32:07.772 --> 01:32:09.387
So see you soon,

1128
01:32:10.567 --> 01:32:11.932
lord of war.

1129
01:32:15.739 --> 01:32:18.651
You still haven't brought me
the gun of Rambo.

1130
01:32:35.467 --> 01:32:40.177
At four and a half months old
a human fetus has a reptile's tail,

1131
01:32:40.346 --> 01:32:42.302
a remnant of our evolution.

1132
01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:44.510
Maybe that's what I couldn't escape.

1133
01:32:44.601 --> 01:32:46.887
You can fight a lot of enemies and survive.

1134
01:32:46.978 --> 01:32:50.061
But if you fight your biology
you will always lose.

1135
01:32:50.148 --> 01:32:53.390
You guys aren't waiting to say goodbye?
I'm not leaving for another 10 minutes.

1136
01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:55.976
-Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.
-Oh, okay.

1137
01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:58.353
You know, I'm kind of glad you're going.

1138
01:32:58.448 --> 01:33:01.235
You've been here so long
you're starting to get on my nerves.

1139
01:33:01.326 --> 01:33:03.533
This oil concession
should be wrapped up by Thursday.

1140
01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:05.906
I'll be back for the weekend.
We'll go somewhere.

1141
01:33:05.997 --> 01:33:08.158
-The sea.
-That would be fun.

1142
01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:10.824
-Come on.
-Hey.

1143
01:33:11.711 --> 01:33:13.497
You trust me, right?

1144
01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:16.913
She looked me directly in the eye

1145
01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:19.750
the way I've looked in the eyes
of a thousand customs officials,

1146
01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:22.426
government bureaucrats
and law enforcement agents.

1147
01:33:22.514 --> 01:33:24.675
Yes, I trust you.

1148
01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:26.924
And she lied without flinching.

1149
01:33:27.477 --> 01:33:30.389
-I'll see you, big guy.
-Bye, papa.

1150
01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:32.762
She learned from the best.

1151
01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:34.313
Have a good trip.

1152
01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:52.536
That's him.

1153
01:34:13.356 --> 01:34:16.143
-Where are we going, mama?
-It's a game, honey.

1154
01:34:16.276 --> 01:34:18.062
Like hide and seek?

1155
01:34:18.736 --> 01:34:19.816
Yes.

1156
01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:23.229
Like hide and seek.

1157
01:34:44.053 --> 01:34:47.841
I can always sense when I'm being tailed.
I know what to look for.

1158
01:34:48.057 --> 01:34:50.799
But then I'd never been tailed
by the woman I love.

1159
01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:05.613
I can put myself in Ava's place.

1160
01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:08.825
She might have understood
if the combination was the last four digits

1161
01:35:08.912 --> 01:35:11.699
of my social security number,
my birthday, even her birthday.

1162
01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:13.279
But not Nicolai's.

1163
01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:32.469
My son's birthday unlocked
what the government would later describe

1164
01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.300
as "a catalog of carnage.”

1165
01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:36.306
Honey, come over here.

1166
01:35:44.906 --> 01:35:46.521
Nicki, stay right here.

1167
01:36:49.762 --> 01:36:51.298
Come on, Nicki.

1168
01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:07.937
-Come to see how the other half lives?
-I miss your borscht.

1169
01:37:08.114 --> 01:37:10.730
-Mom and dad say you're clean.
-Yeah, you, too.

1170
01:37:12.452 --> 01:37:15.535
You went legit, huh?
That's hard to believe.

1171
01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.991
That's because it's not true.

1172
01:37:20.043 --> 01:37:22.830
Only you know.
I'm leaving tonight on a job.

1173
01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.410
I want you to come.

1174
01:37:25.757 --> 01:37:26.963
I can't.

1175
01:37:28.968 --> 01:37:32.426
I've got a girlfriend.
I think she might be the one.

1176
01:37:33.723 --> 01:37:36.180
Plus I'm thinking of opening my own place.

1177
01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:39.308
Maybe this trip will help. It's good money.

1178
01:37:42.231 --> 01:37:43.437
Yuri,

1179
01:37:45.026 --> 01:37:46.357
I've given my word.

1180
01:37:46.444 --> 01:37:50.312
No one has to know. We'll tell
them we're going for a little R&R.

1181
01:37:53.743 --> 01:37:55.529
What do you need me for all of a sudden?

1182
01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:57.326
West Africa's fucked up.

1183
01:37:57.997 --> 01:37:59.453
More than usual.

1184
01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:01.956
I can't trust anybody.

1185
01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:07.249
I need you to watch my back.

1186
01:38:46.003 --> 01:38:47.163
Yuri.

1187
01:38:49.465 --> 01:38:50.955
Welcome back.

1188
01:38:52.635 --> 01:38:54.171
Welcome, both of you.

1189
01:38:54.387 --> 01:38:56.127
Welcome to democracy.

1190
01:38:56.264 --> 01:38:58.380
Democracy?
What have you been drinking, Andy?

1191
01:38:58.975 --> 01:39:00.761
You have not seen the news.

1192
01:39:00.893 --> 01:39:03.259
You know,
they accuse me of rigging elections.

1193
01:39:03.354 --> 01:39:04.469
But after this,

1194
01:39:05.857 --> 01:39:07.977
with your Florida
and your supreme court of kangaroos,

1195
01:39:08.001 --> 01:39:11.038
now the us must shut up forever.

1196
01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:17.861
How do you do this, Yuri, huh?

1197
01:39:19.036 --> 01:39:23.075
How do you do this
when they are watching all of my airspace?

1198
01:39:23.916 --> 01:39:26.202
Where there's a will there's a weapon.

1199
01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:29.372
Come on, where's my fucking money?

1200
01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:35.170
When it is delivered.

1201
01:39:37.221 --> 01:39:39.758
-It is delivered.
-This is not for me.

1202
01:39:40.057 --> 01:39:42.343
This is for my neighbors to the west.

1203
01:39:42.435 --> 01:39:43.720
The west?

1204
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:46.639
We're going to Sierra Leone.

1205
01:39:46.731 --> 01:39:48.938
Oh, yes. And my son,

1206
01:39:49.358 --> 01:39:52.896
Baptiste Jr. will go with you
to make the proper introductions.

1207
01:39:53.488 --> 01:39:54.819
We have no trucks.

1208
01:39:55.698 --> 01:39:59.907
You will,
as soon as we get the food out of them.

1209
01:40:05.166 --> 01:40:06.747
The gun of Rambo.

1210
01:40:07.251 --> 01:40:09.993
Mr. Yuri, you are a man of your word.

1211
01:40:10.588 --> 01:40:12.044
So, where are we going?

1212
01:40:12.381 --> 01:40:15.873
RUF. The freedom fighters.

1213
01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:20.469
Every faction in Africa
calls themselves by these noble names.

1214
01:40:20.556 --> 01:40:22.592
Liberation-this, patriotic-that,

1215
01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:24.844
Democratic Republic of something-or-other.

1216
01:40:24.936 --> 01:40:26.517
Yeah!

1217
01:40:27.438 --> 01:40:28.644
Yeah!

1218
01:40:28.731 --> 01:40:31.347
I guess they can't own up
to what they usually are,

1219
01:40:31.442 --> 01:40:34.980
federation of worse oppressors
than the last bunch of oppressors.

1220
01:40:41.827 --> 01:40:43.863
Often, the most barbaric atrocities occur

1221
01:40:43.955 --> 01:40:47.197
when both combatants
proclaim themselves freedom fighters.

1222
01:40:53.214 --> 01:40:56.377
Right, I've got 500 units, brand new

1223
01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:58.458
right out of the box all as clean as this.

1224
01:40:58.553 --> 01:41:00.009
What have you got?

1225
01:41:17.655 --> 01:41:19.691
God! Oh, Jesus.

1226
01:41:24.370 --> 01:41:25.655
Oh, Jesus.

1227
01:41:29.125 --> 01:41:31.241
Yuri, I need to talk to you.

1228
01:41:31.335 --> 01:41:33.326
-Not now.
-Now.

1229
01:41:35.506 --> 01:41:36.837
Excuse me.

1230
01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:45.595
What?

1231
01:41:46.726 --> 01:41:49.138
-We can't do this deal.
-The fuck we can't.

1232
01:41:49.228 --> 01:41:52.641
-What's the matter with you?
-Look. Look over there.

1233
01:41:52.732 --> 01:41:55.769
As soon as we hand over the guns
those people are going to die.

1234
01:41:57.069 --> 01:41:59.401
It's not our business.

1235
01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:03.064
They killed a boy just now
as young as Nicki.

1236
01:42:07.872 --> 01:42:11.865
-What is the holdup?
-There is no holdup. I'll be right there.

1237
01:42:12.376 --> 01:42:15.288
Vitaly, it's what we always know.
We can't control what they do.

1238
01:42:15.379 --> 01:42:17.961
No, no, today we can.

1239
01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:19.960
Today we can. Yuri, they're right there!

1240
01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:23.168
What do you think they'll do to us
if we back out? They'll kill us.

1241
01:42:23.304 --> 01:42:25.545
And if we go ahead,
what do you think they'll do to them?

1242
01:42:30.978 --> 01:42:32.764
We got to do something.

1243
01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:42.562
What is he saying?

1244
01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.731
It's the deal.

1245
01:42:44.909 --> 01:42:48.447
My brother's not happy with the terms,
but we're working it out. It's nothing.

1246
01:42:57.129 --> 01:42:58.869
Right? It's nothing.

1247
01:43:05.346 --> 01:43:08.258
Yeah, nothing.

1248
01:43:10.434 --> 01:43:12.516
You're right, Yuri. You're right.

1249
01:43:13.562 --> 01:43:15.848
God, I've got to get my shit together.

1250
01:43:17.066 --> 01:43:19.728
-This is not our fight.
-Right.

1251
01:43:20.069 --> 01:43:23.152
Okay, what's the deal? 300 RPGs,

1252
01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:26.943
500 assault rifles and 800 grenades.

1253
01:43:29.286 --> 01:43:31.698
I thought it was 1,200 grenades.

1254
01:43:34.834 --> 01:43:36.495
I was so caught up in the deal

1255
01:43:36.585 --> 01:43:39.122
I never realized what was going on
in Vitaly's head.

1256
01:43:39.213 --> 01:43:42.671
I thought it was 1,200 grenades. Confused.

1257
01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:44.050
Come to think about it,

1258
01:43:44.135 --> 01:43:47.298
maybe I never understood
what was going on in his head.

1259
01:43:51.475 --> 01:43:54.262
I beg your pardon.
May I see another stone?

1260
01:43:54.645 --> 01:43:57.057
One thing I do understand for certain

1261
01:43:57.565 --> 01:44:00.398
is that Vitaly broke the cardinal rule
of gunrunning.

1262
01:44:01.152 --> 01:44:03.859
Never pick up a gun
and join the customers.

1263
01:44:10.995 --> 01:44:12.701
What are you doing?

1264
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:17.956
Something for Yuri.

1265
01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:21.494
Step away. Slow.

1266
01:44:40.024 --> 01:44:41.855
No, Vit!

1267
01:44:43.903 --> 01:44:45.313
No, Vit!

1268
01:46:11.407 --> 01:46:15.696
Only half the guns were gone so I was
still entitled to half the diamonds.

1269
01:46:16.537 --> 01:46:18.448
If I took them, I was lost.

1270
01:46:18.873 --> 01:46:20.829
If I left them, I was lost.

1271
01:46:29.425 --> 01:46:32.758
The massacre played out
exactly how Vitaly predicted.

1272
01:46:32.845 --> 01:46:37.179
But then a half dozen other massacres
happened in Sierra Leone that week.

1273
01:46:37.308 --> 01:46:38.969
You can't stop them all.

1274
01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:41.846
In my experience,
you can't stop any of them.

1275
01:46:43.647 --> 01:46:47.310
They say,
"evil prevails when good men fail to act.”

1276
01:46:47.401 --> 01:46:51.235
What they ought to say is, "evil prevails.”

1277
01:47:05.336 --> 01:47:07.247
I how shared even more in common

1278
01:47:07.338 --> 01:47:10.626
with the leader of that country
god seemed to have forsaken.

1279
01:47:10.716 --> 01:47:13.799
We saw something in each other
neither one of us liked.

1280
01:47:14.011 --> 01:47:16.297
Or maybe,
we were just looking in the mirror.

1281
01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:40.943
I'd paid a Monrovian doctor $20
to remove the lead from Vitaly's body

1282
01:47:41.038 --> 01:47:43.199
and write a bogus death certificate.

1283
01:47:44.041 --> 01:47:45.781
I should have paid more.

1284
01:47:45.876 --> 01:47:48.117
I've smuggled millions of rounds
of ammunition,

1285
01:47:48.212 --> 01:47:52.296
and the bullet that lands me in jail
is found under my dead brother's rib.

1286
01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:55.666
Yuri Orlov.

1287
01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:59.178
We're with the bureau of alcohol,
tobacco and firearms.

1288
01:47:59.264 --> 01:48:02.301
Let me guess. This isn't about
the alcohol or the tobacco.

1289
01:48:44.643 --> 01:48:47.055
-Crimean restaurant.
-Papa?

1290
01:48:54.486 --> 01:48:56.477
Both my sons are dead.

1291
01:49:00.075 --> 01:49:02.282
There are only two tragedies in life.

1292
01:49:02.828 --> 01:49:06.320
One is not getting what you want.
The other is getting it.

1293
01:49:06.665 --> 01:49:07.700
Is this one of yours?

1294
01:49:07.791 --> 01:49:10.624
Jack Valentine finally had what he wanted.

1295
01:49:10.794 --> 01:49:15.037
Curiously, the death certificate
says he died of heart failure.

1296
01:49:16.133 --> 01:49:17.873
Falsifying a death certificate?

1297
01:49:18.635 --> 01:49:20.045
That's not going to hold me.

1298
01:49:20.679 --> 01:49:24.092
You're right. As usual, you are right.

1299
01:49:26.894 --> 01:49:28.805
Have you seen today's paper?

1300
01:49:36.570 --> 01:49:38.106
Fake end-user certificates.

1301
01:49:38.197 --> 01:49:40.654
Cut-out companies,
meticulously catalogued.

1302
01:49:41.492 --> 01:49:45.030
There is hardly a warlord,
dictator or despot

1303
01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.157
anywhere in the world that you're not
on a first-name basis with.

1304
01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:50.739
It was your wife, your trophy-wife,

1305
01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:53.409
that led us to the prize.

1306
01:49:54.004 --> 01:49:56.495
It's not her fault.
She's just easier to follow than you are.

1307
01:49:59.009 --> 01:50:00.044
May I?

1308
01:50:00.761 --> 01:50:02.297
Yeah, go ahead.

1309
01:50:27.037 --> 01:50:28.197
Enjoy it.

1310
01:50:29.081 --> 01:50:30.696
-What?
-This.

1311
01:50:31.708 --> 01:50:35.997
Tell me I'm everything you despise.
That I'm the personification of evil.

1312
01:50:36.588 --> 01:50:37.873
That I'm, what,

1313
01:50:37.965 --> 01:50:42.049
responsible for the breakdown
of the fabric of society and world order.

1314
01:50:42.678 --> 01:50:44.543
I'm a one-man genocide.

1315
01:50:45.597 --> 01:50:49.510
Say everything you want to say to me now.
'Cause you don't have long.

1316
01:50:50.269 --> 01:50:51.975
Are you paying attention?

1317
01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:54.845
Or are you delusional?

1318
01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:58.773
You have broken
every arms embargo written.

1319
01:50:58.986 --> 01:51:00.567
There is enough evidence here

1320
01:51:00.654 --> 01:51:03.361
to put you away
for consecutive life sentences.

1321
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:05.510
You are going to spend
the next 10 years of your life

1322
01:51:05.534 --> 01:51:09.948
going from a cell to a courtroom
before you even start serving your time.

1323
01:51:12.916 --> 01:51:16.909
I don't think you fully appreciate
the seriousness of your situation.

1324
01:51:27.222 --> 01:51:29.429
My family has disowned me.

1325
01:51:31.602 --> 01:51:33.763
My wife and son have left me.

1326
01:51:37.274 --> 01:51:38.935
My brother's dead.

1327
01:51:39.943 --> 01:51:44.437
Trust me, I fully appreciate
the seriousness of my situation.

1328
01:51:45.115 --> 01:51:46.776
But I promise you,

1329
01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:49.779
I won't spend a single second
in a courtroom.

1330
01:51:51.288 --> 01:51:52.824
You are delusional.

1331
01:51:53.457 --> 01:51:55.038
I like you, Jack.

1332
01:51:55.918 --> 01:51:59.035
Well, maybe not, but I understand you.

1333
01:52:03.133 --> 01:52:05.294
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

1334
01:52:06.386 --> 01:52:08.877
This way you can prepare yourself.

1335
01:52:13.477 --> 01:52:14.557
Okay.

1336
01:52:14.645 --> 01:52:17.978
Soon there's gonna be a knock on that
door and you will be called outside.

1337
01:52:18.065 --> 01:52:20.556
In the hall
there will be a man who outranks you.

1338
01:52:20.651 --> 01:52:23.768
First, he'll compliment you
on the fine job you've done,

1339
01:52:23.862 --> 01:52:26.228
that you're making the world a safer place,

1340
01:52:26.323 --> 01:52:29.781
that you're to receive a commendation
and a promotion.

1341
01:52:30.827 --> 01:52:33.534
And then he's going to tell you
that I am to be released.

1342
01:52:33.622 --> 01:52:35.328
You're going to protest.

1343
01:52:36.166 --> 01:52:38.498
You'll probably threaten to resign.

1344
01:52:39.086 --> 01:52:41.498
But in the end I will be released.

1345
01:52:42.339 --> 01:52:43.499
The reason I'll be released

1346
01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:46.377
is the same reason
you think I'll be convicted.

1347
01:52:46.969 --> 01:52:49.881
I do rub shoulders
with some of the most vile,

1348
01:52:49.972 --> 01:52:52.839
sadistic men
calling themselves leaders today.

1349
01:52:54.309 --> 01:52:56.095
But some of those men

1350
01:52:57.396 --> 01:52:59.978
are the enemies of your enemies.

1351
01:53:01.775 --> 01:53:05.063
And while the biggest arms dealer
in the world is your boss,

1352
01:53:05.821 --> 01:53:07.777
the President of the United States,

1353
01:53:07.864 --> 01:53:11.197
who ships more merchandise in a day
than I do in a year,

1354
01:53:12.661 --> 01:53:16.529
sometimes it's embarrassing
to have his fingerprints on the guns.

1355
01:53:17.332 --> 01:53:20.119
Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me

1356
01:53:20.335 --> 01:53:23.077
to supply forces
he can't be seen supplying.

1357
01:53:23.588 --> 01:53:24.703
So,

1358
01:53:26.341 --> 01:53:28.673
you call me evil.

1359
01:53:29.970 --> 01:53:34.179
But unfortunately for you,
I'm a necessary evil.

1360
01:53:50.782 --> 01:53:52.898
I would tell you to go to hell,

1361
01:53:54.369 --> 01:53:56.109
but I think you're already there.

1362
01:54:30.864 --> 01:54:32.946
Pleasure doing business with you.

1363
01:54:33.283 --> 01:54:35.865
Most people are happy
just to get out of jail.

1364
01:54:35.952 --> 01:54:38.159
I expect to be paid to leave.

1365
01:54:38.538 --> 01:54:39.823
I'm not a fool.

1366
01:54:39.915 --> 01:54:41.997
I know that just because
they needed me that day

1367
01:54:42.084 --> 01:54:44.826
didn't mean they wouldn't make me
a scapegoat the next.

1368
01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:48.458
But I was back doing what I do best.

1369
01:55:11.321 --> 01:55:13.812
You know who's going to inherit the earth?

1370
01:55:13.907 --> 01:55:15.272
Arms dealers.

1371
01:55:15.492 --> 01:55:18.484
Because everyone else
is too busy killing each other.

1372
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:20.861
That's the secret to survival.

1373
01:55:21.248 --> 01:55:22.829
Never go to war.

1374
01:55:26.294 --> 01:55:28.000
Especially with yourself.
