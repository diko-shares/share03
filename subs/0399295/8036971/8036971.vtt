00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:24.355
There are over 550 million firearms
in worldwide circulation.

2
00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:28.359
That's one firearm for every
12 people on the planet.

3
00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:30.737
The only question is...

4
00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:36.075
how do we arm the other 11?

<i>I'm not gonna tell you a pack of lies
to make me look good.</i>

39
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:51.062
<i>I'm just gonna tell you
what happened.</i>

40
00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.189
<i>My</i> name <i>is</i> Yuri Orlov.

41
00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:56.526
<i>When I was a boy,
my family came to America,</i>

42
00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:58.402
<i>but not all the way.</i>

43
00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.823
<i>Like most Ukrainians,
we congregated in Brighton Beach.</i>

44
00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:04.367
<i>It reminded us of the Black</i> Sea.

45
00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:07.745
<i>I soon realized we just swapped
one hell for another.</i>

46
00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:13.000
<i>Even in hell, an angel
sometimes makes an appearance.</i>

47
00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:16.838
<i>I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine
since I was 10 years old.</i>

48
00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:20.216
<i>Of course,
she didn't know I existed.</i>

49
00:05:20.842 --> 00:05:23.427
<i>I was starting to think
she had a point.</i>

50
00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.474
<i>For the first 20-odd years
of my life,</i>

51
00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:32.478
<i>Little Odessa was to me
what it is to the Q train:</i>

52
00:05:32.645 --> 00:05:34.438
<i>the end of the line.</i>

53
00:05:36.482 --> 00:05:38.609
<i>Oh, I did lie about my name.</i>

54
00:05:38.776 --> 00:05:40.778
<i>It's not really Yuri Orlov.</i>

55
00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:45.449
<i>On few occasions in the 20th century
has it been an advantage to be a Jew,</i>

56
00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:47.952
<i>but in the '70s,
to escape the Soviet Union,</i>

57
00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:50.329
<i>our family pretended
to be Jewish.</i>

58
00:05:50.496 --> 00:05:53.291
<i>Little about my life
has been kosher ever since.</i>

59
00:05:53.457 --> 00:05:57.295
- How's it going, brother?
- It's not.

60
00:05:57.461 --> 00:06:01.757
<i>Vitaly, my younger brother. He was as
lost as me. He just didn't know it yet.</i>

61
00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:04.135
Yuri, you're late.

62
00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:11.350
<i>My father took
his assumed identity to heart.</i>

63
00:06:11.517 --> 00:06:13.811
<i>He was more Jewish
than most Jews,</i>

64
00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:15.813
<i>which drove my
Catholic mother crazy.</i>

65
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.650
How many times?
I can't eat shellfish.

66
00:06:19.817 --> 00:06:21.569
- It's <i>trayf.</i>
- You're not Jewish.

67
00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:23.487
I like it.

68
00:06:24.322 --> 00:06:26.198
I like the hat-

69
00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:30.536
to remind us there is
something above us.

70
00:06:30.703 --> 00:06:33.164
I like that.

71
00:06:34.874 --> 00:06:36.834
- I'm going to temple.
- You're not.

72
00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:39.170
You go to temple
more than the rabbi.

73
00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:48.179
Yuri, don't forget
to check the specials at the Palace.

74
00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:53.059
<i>Growing up in Little Odessa,
murder was an everyday part of life.</i>

75
00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:56.312
<i>Russian mobsters had also
migrated from the Soviet Union.</i>

76
00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.858
<i>And when they came to America,
their baggage came with them.</i>

77
00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:04.654
<i>There was always some gangster
getting whacked,</i>

78
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.864
<i>but I'd never seen it
with my own</i> eyes-

79
00:07:07.031 --> 00:07:10.368
<i>I had a knack of showing up
five minutes before it went down,</i>

80
00:07:10.534 --> 00:07:12.203
<i>or five minutes after.</i>

81
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.871
<i>Not that day.</i>

82
00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:42.942
<i>It hit me. It couldn't have hit me
harder if I was the one who'd been shot.</i>

83
00:07:43.109 --> 00:07:47.947
<i>You go into the restaurant business
because people will always have to eat.</i>

84
00:07:48.114 --> 00:07:52.618
<i>That day I realized my destiny lay
in fulfilling another basic human need.</i>

85
00:07:56.163 --> 00:07:59.417
<i>The next Sabbath,
I went to temple with my father.</i>

86
00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:02.628
<i>However, it wasn't God
I was trying to get close to.</i>

87
00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:04.964
Eli, my oldest son Yuri.

88
00:08:05.131 --> 00:08:06.716
<i>My contact at synagogue</i>

89
00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:11.387
<i>landed me my first Israeli-made
Uzi submachine guns.</i>

90
00:08:14.807 --> 00:08:18.269
<i>The first time you sell a gun is a lot
like the first time you have sex.</i>

91
00:08:18.436 --> 00:08:20.730
<i>You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing,</i>

92
00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:25.901
<i>but it is exciting, and one way
or another, it's over way too fast.</i>

93
00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:32.074
Gentlemen, the new Uzi
machine pistol -

94
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:33.868
big firepower
in a small package.

95
00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:35.953
This little baby uses
9mm hollow points,

96
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.872
2025-round extendable mags.

97
00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.834
Rear-flip adjustable sights.
Silencer as standard. Recoil reduction.

98
00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:45.254
Muzzle jump reduced 40%,
60% improved noise suppression.

99
00:08:45.421 --> 00:08:48.507
You could pump a mag
into me right now

100
00:08:48.674 --> 00:08:50.468
and never wake the guy
in the next room.

101
00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:55.473
Of course that would eliminate
your opportunity for repeat business.

102
00:08:57.058 --> 00:09:00.186
<i>I did have a natural instinct
for smuggling contraband.</i>

103
00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:05.566
<i>Fortunately, back then a video camera
was as big as a bazooka.</i>

104
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.326
<i>I'd been running away
from violence my whole life,</i>

105
00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:18.204
<i>and I should have been
running towards it.</i>

106
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.789
<i>It's in our nature.</i>

107
00:09:19.955 --> 00:09:24.001
<i>The earliest human skeletons
had spearheads in their ribcages.</i>

108
00:09:24.168 --> 00:09:27.546
<i>S All right</i>

109
00:09:27.713 --> 00:09:30.382
<i>♪ He was a young American</i>

110
00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:33.344
<i>♪ Young American, young American</i>

111
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:35.596
<i>♪ He was a young American</i>

112
00:09:35.763 --> 00:09:38.766
Where have you been?
What if we had a customer?

113
00:09:38.933 --> 00:09:40.768
God bless America.

114
00:09:54.698 --> 00:09:57.284
- Mm, mm-hm.
- Yeah?

115
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:05.835
"Beware of the dog"?
You don't have a dog.

116
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:09.004
- Are you trying to scare people?
- No, it's to scare me.

117
00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:11.924
Remind me to be aware
of the dog in me.

118
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:15.886
The dog that wants to fuck everything
that moves, fight and kill weaker dogs.

119
00:10:16.053 --> 00:10:19.014
I guess it's to remind me
to be more human.

120
00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:21.559
Isn't being a dog
part of being human?

121
00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:25.729
What if that's the best part
of you, the dog part?

122
00:10:25.896 --> 00:10:28.190
What if you're really
just a two-legged dog?

123
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:32.778
You need to see somebody.

124
00:10:32.945 --> 00:10:35.072
It stinks in here.

125
00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:37.700
<i>I'd always wanted to do
something big with my life.</i>

126
00:10:37.867 --> 00:10:39.827
<i>I just didn't know what.</i>

127
00:10:39.994 --> 00:10:42.913
<i>Anyhow, I figured if I was
going into the gun trade,</i>

128
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.748
<i>I was going to aim high.</i>

129
00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:47.585
Vitaly, stop fucking around.
I want to talk to you.

130
00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:53.674
You read the newspapers, V?

131
00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:56.886
The newspaper?
It's always the same.

132
00:10:57.052 --> 00:11:00.139
You're right. Every day
there's people shooting each other.

133
00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:02.266
You know what I do
when I see that'?

134
00:11:02.433 --> 00:11:06.145
I look to see what guns they're using,
and I think to myself, why not my guns?

135
00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:07.605
You opening a gun shop?

136
00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:10.441
Already more of those
in America than McDonald's.

137
00:11:10.608 --> 00:11:14.111
Even with all the gangsters
around here, the margins are too low.

138
00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:16.780
- You've worked out the margins?
- Sure.

139
00:11:18.032 --> 00:11:19.700
Forget gang wars.

140
00:11:19.867 --> 00:11:23.370
The real money's
in actual wars between countries.

141
00:11:23.913 --> 00:11:26.790
Yuri, what the fuck
do you know about guns?

142
00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:29.293
I know which end
I'd rather be on.

143
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:35.132
I made the first sale.
We're already in business.

144
00:11:36.634 --> 00:11:39.178
Whoa. We?

145
00:11:39.345 --> 00:11:41.472
I need a partner.

146
00:11:44.934 --> 00:11:47.978
I don't know.
I don't know, Yuri. I don't know.

147
00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:51.148
Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht.
You're no fucking chef.

148
00:11:51.315 --> 00:11:54.360
I can eat in the restaurant for free,
and I still don't eat there.

149
00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:55.694
Fuck you.

150
00:11:55.861 --> 00:11:57.655
We're doing nothing
with our lives.

151
00:12:00.074 --> 00:12:03.827
I mean, this is shit.
This is shit.

152
00:12:05.496 --> 00:12:06.997
That's true.

153
00:12:08.165 --> 00:12:10.376
But maybe doing nothing's
better than doing this.

154
00:12:14.672 --> 00:12:16.840
I need you.

155
00:12:39.822 --> 00:12:45.035
May I interest you in the shoulder-fired
SA-7 surface-to-air missile?

156
00:12:45.202 --> 00:12:48.872
It's the older Chinese model. Not so
effective against military aircraft,

157
00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:51.667
but deadly if used
against a commercial airliner.

158
00:12:51.834 --> 00:12:54.003
Giving them away at 850.

159
00:12:55.713 --> 00:12:58.674
<i>It was the '80s, and the Cold War
was far from thawed.</i>

160
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:00.884
<i>Most of the deals were
government to government.</i>

161
00:13:01.051 --> 00:13:05.222
<i>It was a mostly private club
with a lifetime club president.</i>

162
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:08.267
- That's him.
- Who, the big shot?

163
00:13:08.434 --> 00:13:09.643
Simeon Weisz.

164
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.981
Angola, Mozambique,
those Exocet missiles in the Falklands.

165
00:13:14.148 --> 00:13:16.942
He was selling guns
before there was gunpowder.

166
00:13:17.901 --> 00:13:18.902
I'll be right back.

167
00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:25.242
Mr. Weisz. Mr. Weisz.

168
00:13:25.743 --> 00:13:27.786
It's OK. They're talking.

169
00:13:27.953 --> 00:13:30.873
- May I help?
- Yes, a mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman,

170
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.084
from Brighton Beach, import, exports,
said to contact you.

171
00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:37.838
I have a business proposal, and
I thought perhaps we could discuss it.

172
00:13:38.005 --> 00:13:41.383
I don't think you and I
are in the same business.

173
00:13:42.134 --> 00:13:46.013
You think I just sell guns, don't you?
I don't. I take sides.

174
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.059
But in the Iran-Iraq war,
you sold guns to both sides.

175
00:13:50.476 --> 00:13:54.146
Did you ever consider
that I wanted both sides to lose?

176
00:13:55.022 --> 00:13:58.108
Bullets change governments
far surer than votes.

177
00:13:59.443 --> 00:14:01.320
You're in the wrong place,
my young friend.

178
00:14:01.487 --> 00:14:04.073
This is no place for amateurs.

179
00:14:09.453 --> 00:14:13.582
<i>Curious how you revert to your native
tongue in moments of extreme anger...</i>

180
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:15.751
<i>and ecstasy.</i>

181
00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:31.433
Oh, you are beautiful.

182
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.477
What's your name again?

183
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:43.112
<i>The only option for Vitaly and me
was under-the-counter gunrunning.</i>

184
00:14:45.322 --> 00:14:48.992
<i>I got my first break in Lebanon
after the suicide bombing.</i>

185
00:14:50.911 --> 00:14:54.123
<i>But I wasn't the only
local kid making good.</i>

186
00:14:58.168 --> 00:14:59.878
<i>When the US leaves a war zone,</i>

187
00:15:00.045 --> 00:15:02.840
<i>they generally don't take
their munitions.</i>

188
00:15:03.006 --> 00:15:06.427
<i>It costs more to bring it back
than to buy new stock.</i>

189
00:15:06.593 --> 00:15:10.055
So we sell by the kilo.

190
00:15:10.222 --> 00:15:13.600
They're secondhand weapons,
but they're still OK.

191
00:15:16.353 --> 00:15:18.939
- How many kilos would you like?
- 5,000.

192
00:15:19.106 --> 00:15:21.316
<i>I had a flair for languages.</i>

193
00:15:21.733 --> 00:15:24.278
<i>But I soon discovered
that what talks best is dollars,</i>

194
00:15:24.445 --> 00:15:28.198
<i>dinars, drachmas, rubles,
rupees and pounds fucking sterling.</i>

195
00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:31.201
<i>Of course, the US Army
got a piece of the action.</i>

196
00:15:31.368 --> 00:15:34.788
<i>Army salaries were no better
in the '80s than they are today.</i>

197
00:15:34.955 --> 00:15:37.833
<i>And some of the brass,
like Lieutenant Colonel Southern</i>

198
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.711
<i>needed to raise money
for their own private wars.</i>

199
00:15:40.878 --> 00:15:42.880
Good to make your acquaintance.

200
00:15:43.046 --> 00:15:47.426
This is bullshit money, V.
This is small fucking potatoes.

201
00:15:47.593 --> 00:15:51.513
- What, you want to go more legit?
- No, more illegal.

202
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.725
What I would give right now
for a plate of cabbage and potatoes.

203
00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:23.086
It's not our fight.

204
00:16:24.421 --> 00:16:26.381
V, come on.

205
00:16:27.466 --> 00:16:29.134
Let's go. Come on.

206
00:16:40.771 --> 00:16:43.065
<i>Selling guns is like
selling vacuum cleaners.</i>

207
00:16:43.232 --> 00:16:45.943
<i>You make calls,
pound the pavement, take orders.</i>

208
00:16:46.109 --> 00:16:48.445
<i>I was an equal opportunity
merchant of death.</i>

209
00:16:48.612 --> 00:16:51.281
<i>I supplied every army
but the Salvation Army.</i>

210
00:16:54.159 --> 00:16:56.954
<i>I sold Israeli-made Uzis
to Muslims.</i>

211
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:04.878
<i>I sold communist-made
bullets to fascists.</i>

212
00:17:21.812 --> 00:17:23.689
<i>I even shipped cargo
to Afghanistan</i>

213
00:17:23.855 --> 00:17:26.525
<i>when they were fighting
my fellow Soviets.</i>

214
00:17:26.692 --> 00:17:28.694
<i>I never sold to Osama bin Laden.</i>

215
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.490
<i>Not on any moral grounds. Back then
he was always bouncing checks.</i>

216
00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:45.002
<i>By the mid '80s,
my weapons were represented</i>

217
00:17:45.168 --> 00:17:48.422
<i>in eight of the world's
top ten war zones.</i>

218
00:18:17.367 --> 00:18:19.161
<i>It's no problem leading a double life.</i>

219
00:18:19.328 --> 00:18:22.331
<i>It's the triple and quadruples lives
that get you in the end.</i>

220
00:18:22.497 --> 00:18:26.543
<i>Back then I carried a French, British,
Israeli and Ukrainian passport</i>

221
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.213
<i>and a student visa for the US -
but that's another story.</i>

222
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.507
<i>I also packed six different briefcases,</i>

223
00:18:32.674 --> 00:18:37.012
<i>depending on who I was that day and
the region of the world I was visiting.</i>

224
00:18:42.059 --> 00:18:43.602
<i>Without operations like mine,</i>

225
00:18:43.769 --> 00:18:48.398
<i>it would be impossible for certain
countries to conduct a respectable war.</i>

226
00:18:48.565 --> 00:18:52.736
<i>I was able to navigate around those
inconvenient little arms embargoes.</i>

227
00:18:52.903 --> 00:18:55.030
<i>There are three basic types
of arms deal</i> -

228
00:18:55.197 --> 00:18:57.658
<i>white being legal,
black being illegal</i>

229
00:18:57.824 --> 00:19:00.786
<i>and my personal
favorite color: gray.</i>

230
00:19:00.952 --> 00:19:03.455
<i>Sometimes I made the deals
so convoluted,</i>

231
00:19:03.622 --> 00:19:06.083
<i>it was hard for me to work out
if they were on the level.</i>

232
00:19:06.249 --> 00:19:09.336
<i>To keep authorities in the dark,
I often spoke in code.</i>

233
00:19:09.503 --> 00:19:12.589
<i>Rocket launchers were "mothers,"
the rockets "children."</i>

234
00:19:12.756 --> 00:19:16.426
<i>The AK-47 assault rifle
was the "angel king."</i>

235
00:19:16.593 --> 00:19:18.720
It's Yuri.

236
00:19:18.887 --> 00:19:21.765
Yeah, well, yeah, Raoul...

237
00:19:21.932 --> 00:19:25.644
Raoul, the angel king
will arrive tomorrow.

238
00:19:26.436 --> 00:19:28.480
Hallelujah to you too.
All right.

239
00:19:28.647 --> 00:19:30.899
<i>The point is if I've done my job right,</i>

240
00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:33.610
<i>an arms embargo should be
practically impossible to enforce.</i>

241
00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:40.450
What?
OK, just slow the fuck down.

242
00:19:40.617 --> 00:19:43.120
I can't understand you. What?

243
00:19:43.286 --> 00:19:46.206
What do you mean "tipped off"?
They know where we are?

244
00:19:46.373 --> 00:19:49.584
Well, where are they?
Well, how long have I got?

245
00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:52.462
"Not long"?
What does that mean? Shit.

246
00:19:52.629 --> 00:19:54.297
- Do we try to lose them?
- On this?

247
00:19:54.464 --> 00:19:58.009
- Yuri, we have to get off this thing.
- No, no one's going anywhere. Slow.

248
00:19:58.176 --> 00:19:59.845
Dead slow. Buy me time.

249
00:20:03.473 --> 00:20:06.393
Yeah, it's Yuri.
Get that fucking rag down!

250
00:20:06.852 --> 00:20:08.562
I need another handle
for this tub.

251
00:20:08.729 --> 00:20:10.814
Something in our weight class.

252
00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:14.526
You, over the side.
We're changing the name. Now!

253
00:20:16.153 --> 00:20:17.821
Yes, it's gotta check out.

254
00:20:17.988 --> 00:20:20.824
<i>The way I look at it,
what's in a name?</i>

255
00:20:20.991 --> 00:20:22.325
Have you got a shorter name?

256
00:20:22.492 --> 00:20:25.370
<i>I'd often change the registration
of the ship or a plane.</i>

257
00:20:25.537 --> 00:20:27.289
<i>But never at such short notice.</i>

258
00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:32.169
Damn, they're hauling.

259
00:20:34.254 --> 00:20:37.799
What? "Kono."
How do you spell that? K-o-n-o.

260
00:20:37.966 --> 00:20:39.593
OK, well, that's good. Kono.

261
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.720
K-o-n-o.

262
00:20:41.887 --> 00:20:43.930
What are we flying?
Dutch. Got it.

263
00:20:44.097 --> 00:20:45.974
V, get me a Dutch flag,
would you?

264
00:20:56.985 --> 00:20:59.821
Faster or I'll send your ass in!

265
00:20:59.988 --> 00:21:01.865
- Yuri, I don't have Dutch.
- What?

266
00:21:02.032 --> 00:21:03.992
- I've got Belgium.
- What use is that?

267
00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:07.037
He's painting a name
registered in the fucking Netherlands.

268
00:21:08.288 --> 00:21:10.207
- I've got a French flag.
- So?

269
00:21:10.373 --> 00:21:12.375
Turn it sideways...

270
00:21:12.542 --> 00:21:15.045
it's Dutch.

271
00:21:15.504 --> 00:21:17.088
That's why you're my brother.

272
00:21:39.569 --> 00:21:42.572
All right, good.
Everybody look innocent now.

<i>They say every man

274
00:21:54.501 --> 00:21:56.419

275
00:21:56.586 --> 00:21:59.214
<i>Interpol agent Jack Valentine
couldn't be bought,</i>

276
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:01.383
<i>at least not with money.</i>

277
00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.344
<i>For Jack, glory was the prize.</i>

278
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:06.972
Yeah, it's the Kono.
It's not the Kristol.

279
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.140
<i>Keno. K-o-n-o.</i>

280
00:22:09.307 --> 00:22:12.477
- <i>It's</i> clean, sir.
- It's clean?

281
00:22:12.644 --> 00:22:16.106
Sure doesn't look clean.
I'm gonna go aboard.

282
00:22:16.273 --> 00:22:19.150

<i>Even when I was up against
an overzealous agent,</i>

284
00:22:29.035 --> 00:22:32.455
<i>I had a number of methods
for discouraging a search.</i>

285
00:22:32.622 --> 00:22:36.293
<i>I routinely mislabeled
my arms shipments "farm machinery."</i>

286
00:22:36.459 --> 00:22:39.045
<i>And I have yet to meet

Yuri. It's my brother Yuri.

338
00:26:36.533 --> 00:26:38.701
He's my big brother.

339
00:26:40.245 --> 00:26:43.248
- What the fuck is that?
- Ukraine.

340
00:26:43.414 --> 00:26:46.584
I was young, but I remember. Look.

341
00:26:46.751 --> 00:26:48.837
I start in Odessa, right?

342
00:26:49.003 --> 00:26:52.132
And then I work my way
to the Crimean.

343
00:26:52.298 --> 00:26:54.217
You'll be dead
before you reach Kiev.

344
00:26:54.384 --> 00:26:56.553
- Come on, we're going home.
- You fuck!

345
00:26:56.719 --> 00:27:00.890
You fucking fuck!
You fucking fuck!

346
00:27:01.057 --> 00:27:03.309
What the fuck is your problem?

347
00:27:10.024 --> 00:27:12.110
Come on, Vit.

348
00:27:14.487 --> 00:27:17.657
- It's so nice to be home.
- Yeah, we're gonna get you home.

349
00:27:17.824 --> 00:27:19.325
Come on.

350
00:27:28.918 --> 00:27:31.087
Get out of the car.

351
00:27:35.508 --> 00:27:38.803
Vitaly, I need you
to get out of the car.

352
00:27:40.263 --> 00:27:42.056
I promised our parents.

353
00:27:43.349 --> 00:27:44.350
Please.

354
00:27:44.517 --> 00:27:47.103
You're gonna have a great time.
This is a top place.

355
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:51.065
Two models checked in last week. That
cute weather girl's been here since July.

356
00:27:51.232 --> 00:27:53.902
Please, please.

357
00:27:54.652 --> 00:27:55.820
Please, Yuri.

358
00:28:14.047 --> 00:28:16.382
You're a good brother.

359
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.802
- OK.
- You're a good brother, Yuri.

360
00:28:19.969 --> 00:28:22.096
- OK, all right.
- Good brother.

361
00:28:22.263 --> 00:28:25.475
All right,
get out of the car. OK.

362
00:28:26.517 --> 00:28:27.644
Get out of the car.

363
00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:37.362
<i>From then on,
I was a one-man operation.</i>

364
00:28:37.528 --> 00:28:40.490
<i>I never understood what separated
the recreational drug user</i>

365
00:28:40.657 --> 00:28:43.076
<i>from the habitual,
but for the grace of God,</i>

366
00:28:43.243 --> 00:28:47.205
<i>it could have been me snorting
lines as long as the Belt Parkway.</i>

367
00:28:47.372 --> 00:28:50.208
<i>However, I wasn't entirely
free of the grip of addiction myself.</i>

368
00:28:51.668 --> 00:28:54.671
<i>There she was again.
Ava Fontaine.</i>

369
00:28:54.837 --> 00:28:57.757
<i>In my neighborhood,
they say "The good get out."</i>

370
00:28:57.924 --> 00:29:00.718
<i>In our own ways,
we'd both conquered the world.</i>

371
00:29:18.027 --> 00:29:19.946
<i>You can't force someone
to love you.</i>

372
00:29:20.113 --> 00:29:23.032
<i>But you can definitely
improve your odds.</i>

373
00:29:23.449 --> 00:29:26.202
<i>It cost me 20 grand
to book her for a fake photo shoot,</i>

374
00:29:26.369 --> 00:29:29.122
<i>another 12 to buy out the hotel.</i>

375
00:30:11.914 --> 00:30:13.916
It's a popular hotel, huh?

376
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.630
- Ava Fontaine.
- Yuri Orlov.

377
00:30:20.506 --> 00:30:22.759
- What brings you to St. Bart's?
- Photo shoot.

378
00:30:22.925 --> 00:30:24.594
At least that was the plan.

379
00:30:24.761 --> 00:30:27.221
Guess the photographer
got stuck in Miami.

380
00:30:27.388 --> 00:30:29.474
Hurricane, though there's nothing
on the news.

381
00:30:30.808 --> 00:30:34.562
Those things can come
out of nowhere.

382
00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:36.439
So, the job's been canceled,

383
00:30:36.606 --> 00:30:39.359
and there's no flight back to New York
until Tuesday.

384
00:30:39.525 --> 00:30:42.737
You can hitch a ride with me
if you like. I'm leaving tomorrow.

385
00:30:42.904 --> 00:30:46.949
Meanwhile, why don't I
take your picture?

386
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.787
<i>In my experience, some
of the most successful relationships</i>

387
00:30:50.953 --> 00:30:52.955
<i>are based on lies and deceit.</i>

388
00:30:53.122 --> 00:30:57.001
<i>Since that's where they usually end up
anyway, it's a logical place to start.</i>

389
00:30:57.168 --> 00:30:58.878
Right there. Right there.
Hold it.

390
00:30:59.045 --> 00:31:01.506
Oh my God!

391
00:31:04.008 --> 00:31:06.719
<i>I nearly went broke trying
to convince her I was anything but.</i>

392
00:31:09.347 --> 00:31:12.809
<i>I knew Ava was not the kind of woman
to be seduced by a ride in a private jet</i>

393
00:31:12.975 --> 00:31:15.228
<i>unless you owned the jet.</i>

394
00:31:15.395 --> 00:31:18.606
- This is your plane?
- That is my name.

395
00:31:18.773 --> 00:31:20.983
<i>Of course I was lying.
The plane was a rental</i>

396
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.861
<i>like the car and even the suit
I was standing in.</i>

397
00:31:24.028 --> 00:31:26.864
<i>At the last minute I bribed
the crew for the paint job.</i>

398
00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:28.950
<i>Luckily by the time we landed,</i>

399
00:31:29.117 --> 00:31:31.953
<i>Ava wasn't looking anywhere
but in my eyes.</i>

400
00:31:32.995 --> 00:31:37.542
I had no idea.
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

401
00:31:37.708 --> 00:31:41.003
Don't apologize.
I put clothes on for a living.

402
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:42.839
At least you're not taking them off.

403
00:31:43.005 --> 00:31:45.675
I would be if half the photographers
had their way.

404
00:31:45.842 --> 00:31:49.178
- What about you?
- I'm in transport.

405
00:31:49.345 --> 00:31:51.389
International air freight mostly.

406
00:31:51.556 --> 00:31:52.974
Business is good.

407
00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:58.020
- Where are you from?
- Ukraine, but I grew up in Brooklyn.

408
00:31:58.187 --> 00:32:00.022
- No.
- What, you too?

409
00:32:00.189 --> 00:32:01.482
Williamsburg.

410
00:32:05.403 --> 00:32:07.363
Well, here's to a hurricane.

411
00:32:08.656 --> 00:32:10.992
Without it I never
would have met you.

412
00:32:12.243 --> 00:32:14.954
This is no accident, is it, Yuri?

413
00:32:19.167 --> 00:32:20.835
It feels like fate.

414
00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:23.754
I don't believe in fate.

415
00:32:24.881 --> 00:32:26.090
What do you believe in?

416
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:10.384
Is that a view or is that a view?

417
00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:12.595
That's a view.

418
00:33:23.189 --> 00:33:25.399
Thank you. Thank you all.

419
00:33:29.612 --> 00:33:31.364
- Mazel tov.
- Congratulations.

420
00:33:31.531 --> 00:33:33.241
Thanks.

421
00:33:35.326 --> 00:33:38.162
Always remember, son,
there's something above you.

422
00:33:38.329 --> 00:33:42.166
Sure, Dad.

424
00:33:45.127 --> 00:33:47.004
Make yourselves at home.

425
00:33:47.171 --> 00:33:49.966
Go. Go!

426
00:34:03.604 --> 00:34:06.148
I'm sorry. Today must be tough.

427
00:34:07.483 --> 00:34:10.987
Be nice to have a couple more guests
from my side of the family.

428
00:34:11.445 --> 00:34:14.949
- I'm sure they're watching right now.
- Thank you.

429
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:19.954
But you don't believe that, Yuri.
Remember?

430
00:34:21.831 --> 00:34:23.499
I know you, Yuri.

431
00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:26.460
I know you're not
everything you seem.

432
00:34:27.628 --> 00:34:30.506
Don't worry.
I won't ask a lot of questions.

433
00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.217
I don't want to hear you lie.

434
00:34:34.135 --> 00:34:36.178
You take risks.

435
00:34:36.345 --> 00:34:38.014
Just...

436
00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.057
promise me you won't risk us.

439
00:34:52.153 --> 00:34:55.114
<i>I've never been so glad
to see Vitaly.</i>

440
00:34:55.281 --> 00:34:57.992
- So fucking beautiful!
- Oh!

441
00:34:59.035 --> 00:35:00.786
Brother, brother,
thank you so much

442
00:35:00.953 --> 00:35:03.623
for giving me such
a beautiful sister.

443
00:35:03.789 --> 00:35:06.417
<i>He was out of rehab
and out of his mind.</i>

444
00:35:06.584 --> 00:35:08.711
- Dance! Dance! We have to dance!
- All right.

445
00:35:08.878 --> 00:35:10.880
It's a wedding. A celebration. To Yuri!

446
00:35:11.047 --> 00:35:13.799
<i>But for once, he rescued me.</i>

447
00:35:17.345 --> 00:35:19.138
<i>I was still living
way beyond my means.</i>

448
00:35:19.305 --> 00:35:22.933
<i>Mortgaged to the hilt, using
one credit card to pay off another.</i>

449

<i>Anything to keep Ava in the style to
which she had</i> - <i>thanks largely to me</i> -

450

<i>become accustomed.</i>

451
00:35:28.606 --> 00:35:31.192
Ava! Ava this is too much.

452
00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:32.777
Yuri likes to spoil you.

453
00:35:32.943 --> 00:35:35.404
<i>Then suddenly
all my Christmases came at once.</i>

454
00:35:35.571 --> 00:35:38.199
Nicki, you did it! Good boy!

455
00:35:38.366 --> 00:35:40.743
Ha ha! That's my grandson!

456
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:42.912
Yuri, do you see
what your son is doing?

457
00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:45.247
<i>Whoever said
it's better to give than receive</i>

458
00:35:45.414 --> 00:35:47.750
<i>never got a Christmas present
like the one I got</i>

459
00:35:47.917 --> 00:35:50.753
<i>in 1991 from Mikhail Gorbachev.</i>

460
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.756
- What the hell's the matter?
- It's over! It's over!

461
00:35:53.923 --> 00:35:55.675
- What's over?
- The Cold-fucking-War!

462
00:35:55.841 --> 00:35:59.428
The Soviet-fucking-Union! The evil
empire. Mikhail's saying "no mas."

463
00:35:59.595 --> 00:36:01.597
He's throwing in the towel.
It's over!

464
00:36:05.643 --> 00:36:08.604
- Your son is walking.
- That's incredible, honey.

465
00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.487
At least there'll be religious freedom.

466
00:36:16.654 --> 00:36:19.407
Let's hope so.

467
00:36:19.573 --> 00:36:21.951
I think I'll go back for a visit.

468
00:36:22.118 --> 00:36:24.495
Do you stay in touch
with Uncle Dmitri?

469
00:36:28.124 --> 00:36:30.835
I'm not a fool, Yuri.

470
00:36:31.836 --> 00:36:34.964
I don't think you're going
just to sell Pepsi-Cola.

471
00:36:38.718 --> 00:36:41.220
Is this how you want
to be remembered?

472
00:36:41.387 --> 00:36:42.972
(Uaughs)

473
00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:44.807
I don't want to be
remembered at all.

474
00:36:44.974 --> 00:36:47.351
If I'm being remembered
it means I'm dead.

475
00:36:48.978 --> 00:36:51.981
Merry fucking Christmas!

476
00:36:52.398 --> 00:36:54.150
Who is this, Vitaly?

477
00:36:54.316 --> 00:36:58.237
- I'm Angel.
- Her name really is Angel.

478
00:36:58.404 --> 00:37:00.281
She's a fairy.

479
00:37:02.533 --> 00:37:05.327
Let's put her on top
of the Christmas tree.

480
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.836
- I love you!
- Come on.

481
00:37:14.003 --> 00:37:17.506
I love you all.

482
00:37:17.673 --> 00:37:19.258
Take this.

483
00:37:37.193 --> 00:37:39.069
I'm going back to Ukraine.

484
00:37:42.698 --> 00:37:44.950
I miss Odessa.

485
00:37:53.501 --> 00:37:55.878
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

486
00:37:58.756 --> 00:38:01.550
Be careful, Yuri.
Those things you sell kill.

487
00:38:04.345 --> 00:38:05.513
Inside.

488
00:38:08.265 --> 00:38:10.184
You're high.

489
00:38:11.185 --> 00:38:12.728
Well, that's true.

490
00:38:15.856 --> 00:38:17.566
Hello, Christian.

491
00:38:25.074 --> 00:38:26.700
<i>During the Cold War, the Red Army</i>

492
00:38:26.867 --> 00:38:29.078
<i>stationed nearly one million troops
in Ukraine</i>

493
00:38:29.245 --> 00:38:32.498
<i>because of its strategic
military importance.</i>

494
00:38:32.665 --> 00:38:36.001
<i>The day after the Wall came down
the paychecks stopped coming.</i>

495
00:38:37.503 --> 00:38:39.380
<i>There's nothing better
for an arms dealer</i>

496
00:38:39.547 --> 00:38:44.468
<i>than the combination of disgruntled
soldiers and warehouses of weapons.</i>

497
00:38:46.929 --> 00:38:49.139
<i>I was hoping
Major General Dmitri Volkoff</i>

498
00:38:49.306 --> 00:38:53.018
<i>would open a lot of armory doors
in lots of military bases.</i>

499
00:38:53.185 --> 00:38:55.271
<i>For a start, he was family.</i>

500
00:38:55.437 --> 00:38:57.773
<i>He was a highly decorated hero
of the Red Army</i>

501
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.442
<i>and he was almost
permanently shit-faced.</i>

502
00:39:00.609 --> 00:39:04.488
I can't just sell you
government property, Yuri.

503
00:39:05.823 --> 00:39:06.949
I have to report.

504
00:39:07.116 --> 00:39:09.785
Report to who? Moscow?

505
00:39:12.663 --> 00:39:14.790
As of last week Moscow's
in a foreign country.

506
00:39:14.957 --> 00:39:16.834
New flag, new boss.

507
00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:20.296
There is no new boss yet.
They're all too busy squabbling

508
00:39:20.462 --> 00:39:23.966
over who's gonna get the presidential
holiday home at the Black Sea.

509
00:39:24.133 --> 00:39:25.968
It's beautiful.

510
00:39:26.135 --> 00:39:30.306
The ones who know don't care anymore
and the ones who care don't know.

511
00:39:34.351 --> 00:39:35.853
Show me your inventory.

512
00:39:47.156 --> 00:39:50.409
<i>Those 45 years of mutual hatred
between the East and the West</i>

513
00:39:50.576 --> 00:39:53.829
<i>had generated the highest
weapons buildup in history.</i>

514
00:39:53.996 --> 00:39:56.498
<i>The Soviets had guns coming out
of the demon hole.</i>

515
00:39:56.665 --> 00:40:00.836
<i>Huge stockpiles,
and now no enemy.</i>

516
00:40:01.003 --> 00:40:03.881
How many Kalashnikovs
do you have?

517
00:40:05.507 --> 00:40:07.676
40,000.

518
00:40:07.843 --> 00:40:10.930
Is that a four?
Doesn't look like a four to me.

519
00:40:11.096 --> 00:40:14.558
- Looks more like a one.
- No, it's a four.

520
00:40:14.725 --> 00:40:19.313
It's whatever we say it is because
no one else will know the difference.

521
00:40:21.482 --> 00:40:25.361
10,000 Kalashnikovs
for a battalion.

522
00:40:25.527 --> 00:40:27.780
Your stocks are dangerously
depleted, Dmitri.

523
00:40:27.947 --> 00:40:31.241
You should order more
from the factory.

524
00:40:31.408 --> 00:40:33.327
Someone will work it out.

525
00:40:34.912 --> 00:40:37.581
- What happens then?
- We'll cut them in.

526
00:40:40.668 --> 00:40:44.588
<i>The end of the Cold War was the start
of the hottest time in arms dealing.</i>

527
00:40:44.755 --> 00:40:46.924
<i>The arms bazaar was open.</i>

528
00:40:47.633 --> 00:40:49.718
<i>Guided missiles,
unguided missiles,</i>

529
00:40:49.885 --> 00:40:54.390
<i>mortars, mines, armored personnel
carriers, whole tank divisions.</i>

530
00:40:59.895 --> 00:41:03.565
<i>I even landed a squadron
of helicopter gunships</i> -

531
00:41:15.661 --> 00:41:18.122
<i>the most sophisticated
fighting machines,</i>

532
00:41:18.288 --> 00:41:21.291
<i>built for a war with America
that never happened.</i>

533
00:41:26.922 --> 00:41:31.010
<i>Thanks to me, they'd finally
get to fire a shot in anger.</i>

534
00:41:38.726 --> 00:41:42.271
<i>I have a feeling it wasn't exactly
what comrade Lenin had in mind</i>

535
00:41:42.438 --> 00:41:45.774
<i>when he advocated
the redistribution of wealth.</i>

536
00:41:45.941 --> 00:41:50.946
<i>But I wasn't the only one offering
a crash course in capitalism.</i>

537
00:41:51.613 --> 00:41:53.532
<i>I had rivals.</i>

538
00:41:53.699 --> 00:41:57.703
Inform your commanding officer
that Simeon Weisz is here to meet him.

539
00:42:00.622 --> 00:42:02.041
You don't know who I am, do you?

540
00:42:14.636 --> 00:42:16.013
You're late.

541
00:42:16.972 --> 00:42:18.223
So it appears.

542
00:42:48.378 --> 00:42:51.507
You look a little lost, Simeon.
Is the world changing too fast?

543
00:42:52.174 --> 00:42:55.344
- I'm here, aren't I?
- Not all of you, I think.

544
00:42:55.511 --> 00:42:57.805
You've gotten so rich
selling for the CIA

545
00:42:57.971 --> 00:43:01.016
you can't seem to get that ideology
completely out of your head.

546
00:43:01.183 --> 00:43:03.310
Oh, the Cold War had its uses.

547
00:43:04.436 --> 00:43:06.522
Kept attentions frozen.

548
00:43:07.523 --> 00:43:11.026
Now it's harder to determine
which side one's on.

549
00:43:11.193 --> 00:43:13.028
Things have become more complicated.

550
00:43:13.195 --> 00:43:15.280
No, it's gotten simpler.

551
00:43:15.447 --> 00:43:18.617
There's no place in gunrunning
for politics anymore, Simeon.

552
00:43:18.784 --> 00:43:21.161
I sell to leftists and rightists.

553
00:43:21.328 --> 00:43:24.331
I'd sell to pacifists but they're not
the most regular of customers.

554
00:43:25.541 --> 00:43:27.292
But you're not a true internationalist

555
00:43:27.459 --> 00:43:30.254
until you've supplied weapons
to kill your own countrymen.

556
00:43:32.756 --> 00:43:36.552
This current state of chaos
won't last forever.

557
00:43:37.553 --> 00:43:40.347
There'll have to be order.

558
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:44.518
Instead of cutting
each other's throats,

559
00:43:44.685 --> 00:43:47.771
it may be beneficial if we work
together. What do you think?

560
00:43:50.732 --> 00:43:52.276
What do I think?

561
00:43:53.193 --> 00:43:55.863
I think you're the amateur now.

562
00:43:56.029 --> 00:44:00.117
I think you should go with your
instincts. With your first instinct.

563
00:44:00.284 --> 00:44:02.828
I'm the same man who was not
good enough for you before

564
00:44:02.995 --> 00:44:07.082
and I'm just not good enough
for you now.

565
00:44:20.762 --> 00:44:23.932
The problem with gunrunners
going to war...

566
00:44:24.933 --> 00:44:27.769
is that there's no shortage
of ammunition.

567
00:44:30.439 --> 00:44:34.193
<i>This was the chaos
that the old guard had always feared.</i>

568
00:44:34.359 --> 00:44:37.863
<i>As far as they were concerned,
I was giving arms dealers a bad name.</i>

569
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:42.534
<i>But then they could hardly report me
to the Better Business Bureau.</i>

570
00:44:43.285 --> 00:44:45.454
<i>And Ukraine
wasn't the only former state</i>

571
00:44:45.621 --> 00:44:48.665
<i>with an unpaid army
and stockpiles of guns.</i>

572
00:44:48.832 --> 00:44:51.043
<i>There was Bulgaria, Hungary,</i>

573
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.629
<i>Poland, Belarus,</i>

574
00:44:53.795 --> 00:44:56.089
<i>all there for the taking.</i>

575
00:44:59.676 --> 00:45:02.638
<i>Of all the weapons
in the vast Soviet arsenal</i>

576
00:45:02.804 --> 00:45:07.935
<i>nothing was more profitable than
Avtomat Kalashnikova, model of 1947,</i>

577
00:45:08.101 --> 00:45:12.314
<i>more commonly known
as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov.</i>

578
00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:15.234
<i>It's the world's
most popular assault rifle.</i>

579
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.319
<i>A weapon all fighters love.</i>

580
00:45:17.486 --> 00:45:21.823
<i>An elegantly simple 9-lb. amalgamation
of forged steel and plywood.</i>

581
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:24.576
<i>It doesn't break, jam, or overheat.</i>

582
00:45:24.743 --> 00:45:27.913
<i>It will shoot whether it's covered
in mud or filled with sand.</i>

583
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.667
<i>It's so easy even a child can use it,
and they do.</i>

584
00:45:31.833 --> 00:45:33.710
<i>The Soviets put the gun on a coin.</i>

585
00:45:33.877 --> 00:45:36.255
<i>Mozambique put it on their flag.</i>

586
00:45:36.421 --> 00:45:37.714
<i>Since the end of the Cold War,</i>

587
00:45:37.881 --> 00:45:41.510
<i>the Kalashnikov has become
the Russian people's greatest export.</i>

588
00:45:41.677 --> 00:45:46.223
<i>After that comes vodka,
caviar and suicidal novelists.</i>

589
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:50.686
<i>One thing's for sure.
No one was lining up to buy their cars.</i>

590
00:46:21.133 --> 00:46:22.718
You were supposed to be
watching out.

591
00:46:22.884 --> 00:46:26.263
How can I?
You keep selling my helicopters.

592
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:28.348
You are too greedy, Yuri.

593
00:46:28.515 --> 00:46:30.392
I can't hold him forever.

594
00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:33.395
- I've got paperwork.
- Not for the gunships.

595
00:46:33.562 --> 00:46:36.106
You know the penalty
for sanction-busting.

596
00:46:36.273 --> 00:46:39.401
Selling the military helicopter
is a major violation.

597
00:46:39.568 --> 00:46:41.737
Military helicopter.

598
00:46:45.157 --> 00:46:47.284
It's not a military helicopter.

599
00:46:47.451 --> 00:46:49.578
It's a rescue helicopter.

600
00:46:49.745 --> 00:46:51.079
Get to work, son.

601
00:46:54.499 --> 00:46:56.251
The law is on our side.

602
00:47:15.812 --> 00:47:17.981
All right, let me see your papers.

603
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:21.234
No, no, put that away.
Let's see your papers.

604
00:47:21.401 --> 00:47:23.612
- Yuri Orlov.
- Mr. Orlov.

605
00:47:23.779 --> 00:47:25.781
Always in the wrong place
at the right time.

606
00:47:28.992 --> 00:47:32.162
We've met before.
Off the coast of Colombia.

607
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:36.833
What was the name of that freighter?
I can't remember. Kono or the Kristol?

608
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.296
The crew called it a lot of names - none
of them repeatable in polite company.

609
00:47:41.463 --> 00:47:44.800
- Answer the question.
- The new MP-5.

610
00:47:45.425 --> 00:47:48.470
- Would you like a silencer for that?
- I need to see your papers.

611
00:47:51.556 --> 00:47:53.308
Dmitri!

612
00:47:56.978 --> 00:48:01.733
The end-user certificate
for this aircraft states "Burkina Faso."

613
00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.694
Nice. Very nice.
Did you type this up yourself?

614
00:48:04.861 --> 00:48:07.489
The helicopter is to be used
on humanitarian missions.

615
00:48:07.656 --> 00:48:10.492
- Oh, so you're a humanitarian?
- Oh, absolutely.

616
00:48:10.659 --> 00:48:13.328
This is a military aircraft.

617
00:48:13.495 --> 00:48:15.247
- Not anymore.
- Listen to the nephew.

618
00:48:15.414 --> 00:48:19.876
What can they do with military
hardware but convert it to civilian use?

619
00:48:20.043 --> 00:48:23.171
The only way you could die from this
baby now is if a food drop hits you.

620
00:48:26.341 --> 00:48:28.969
This stuff here?
Is that going to Burkina Faso as well?

621
00:48:29.136 --> 00:48:31.513
But to a different client
at a different address.

622
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.517
Just a coincidence, is that it? Do you
take me for a complete fucking fool?

623
00:48:35.684 --> 00:48:39.563
Not complete, sir. And while
I hesitate to tell you your job,

624
00:48:39.729 --> 00:48:43.692
when shipped separately,
the weapons and aircraft both comply

625
00:48:43.859 --> 00:48:45.861
with current Interpol trade standards.

626
00:48:46.027 --> 00:48:49.698
We both know that is an obscene
bureaucratic loophole

627
00:48:49.865 --> 00:48:51.992
that's gonna be closed
any goddamn day.

628
00:48:52.159 --> 00:48:54.035
But it's not closed.

629
00:48:54.202 --> 00:48:57.330
And while certain people may
interpret this cargo as suspicious,

630
00:48:57.497 --> 00:49:01.042
thank God we live in a world where
suspicion does not constitute crime.

631
00:49:01.209 --> 00:49:04.004
And where men like you
respect the rule of law.

632
00:49:08.967 --> 00:49:12.262
<i>I was as guilty as sin,
but Valentine couldn't prove it.</i>

633
00:49:12.429 --> 00:49:14.973
<i>And he was the rarest breed
of law enforcement officer.</i>

634
00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:16.892
<i>The type who knew
I was breaking the law</i>

635
00:49:17.058 --> 00:49:19.352
<i>but wouldn't break it himself
to bust me.</i>

636
00:49:23.398 --> 00:49:26.193
<i>He wasn't the only one
trying to put me out of business.</i>

637
00:49:26.359 --> 00:49:29.154
<i>My uncle had turned down
a half dozen rival arms dealers.</i>

638
00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:31.448
<i>Sometimes with offers
better than mine.</i>

639
00:49:31.615 --> 00:49:35.744
<i>But to Dmitri,
you couldn't put a price on loyalty.</i>

640
00:49:47.923 --> 00:49:51.051
- What was he doing here?
- He is hoping to beat your offer.

641
00:49:51.218 --> 00:49:55.931
I told him to go have
intercourse with himself. But, Yuri...

642
00:49:56.097 --> 00:49:58.433
- You need to make more payoffs.
- Too many know.

643
00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:03.104
Don't worry. There are more VCRs,
cigarettes. I left them in your new car.

644
00:50:03.271 --> 00:50:06.608
Even your enemy
was admiring that car.

645
00:50:09.653 --> 00:50:12.113
I am the luckiest man alive.

646
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.657
You are.

647
00:50:52.487 --> 00:50:53.989
- Hello?
- Ava?

648
00:50:54.155 --> 00:50:56.116
Hi, baby.

649
00:50:57.033 --> 00:51:00.996
- You forget what time it is?
- I'm sorry, I...

650
00:51:01.162 --> 00:51:04.124
How was that... your audition?

651
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.837
They're going in another direction.
Direction of someone who can act.

652
00:51:09.004 --> 00:51:10.630
They don't deserve you.

653
00:51:12.716 --> 00:51:15.635
Where are you? Is everything OK?

654
00:51:17.846 --> 00:51:19.973
It was a rough day
at the office.

655
00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:23.184
- Come home.
- Soon. How's Nicki?

656
00:51:23.351 --> 00:51:26.688
<i>He misses you. We both do.</i>

657
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:29.983
It's lonely without you here.

658
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:34.195
You know I don't like nights.
Ever since my parents.

659
00:51:42.412 --> 00:51:44.164
<i>Yuri, what's that?</i>

660
00:51:44.331 --> 00:51:48.251
A party. I'd better go. Just wanted
to call and hear your voice.

661
00:51:48.418 --> 00:51:50.170
<i>- Kiss Nicki for me.</i>
- I <i>love</i> you.

662
00:51:54.215 --> 00:51:57.218
<i>The pillaging didn't die with my uncle.</i>

663
00:51:57.385 --> 00:52:01.348
<i>After the Wall came down,
$32 billion dollars worth of arms</i>

664
00:52:01.514 --> 00:52:04.225
<i>were stolen and resold
from Ukraine alone.</i>

665
00:52:04.392 --> 00:52:08.355
<i>One of the greatest heists
of the 20th century.</i>

666
00:52:21.242 --> 00:52:23.078
<i>The primary market was Africa.</i>

667
00:52:23.244 --> 00:52:27.332
<i>11 major conflicts involving
32 countries in less than a decade.</i>

668
00:52:27.499 --> 00:52:29.501
<i>A gunrunner's wet dream.</i>

669
00:52:29.668 --> 00:52:31.670
<i>At the time,
the West couldn't care less.</i>

670
00:52:31.836 --> 00:52:35.090
<i>They had a white war in what
was left of Yugoslavia.</i>

671
00:52:35.256 --> 00:52:39.260
<i>I did the bulk of my business in
Liberia. "Land of the Free."</i>

672
00:52:39.427 --> 00:52:42.806
<i>Originally established as a homeland
for freed American slaves,</i>

673
00:52:42.972 --> 00:52:46.393
<i>it's been enslaved by one dictator
or another ever since.</i>

674
00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:52.440
<i>The latest was American-educated
self-declared president Andre Baptiste.</i>

675
00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:57.946
Mr. Yuri!

676
00:52:59.948 --> 00:53:02.117
I'm Andre Baptiste Jr.

677
00:53:03.702 --> 00:53:06.871
- My father would like to meet you.
- What an honor.

678
00:53:08.206 --> 00:53:10.959
Thank him, but unfortunately
I have other business.

679
00:53:11.126 --> 00:53:13.628
It's a shame.
It's a very busy schedule.

680
00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:22.721
It is not...

681
00:53:22.887 --> 00:53:25.807
as they say... optional.

682
00:53:27.809 --> 00:53:30.437
My father is easily offended.

683
00:53:31.646 --> 00:53:33.356
My schedule just freed up.

684
00:53:33.523 --> 00:53:35.024
Whoo!

685
00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:37.652
<i>President Baptiste
was my best customer,</i>

686
00:53:37.819 --> 00:53:39.654
<i>but I was in no hurry to meet him.</i>

687
00:53:39.821 --> 00:53:42.490
<i>He had a reputation
for routinely hacking off the limbs</i>

688
00:53:42.657 --> 00:53:44.117
<i>of those who opposed him.</i>

689
00:53:44.284 --> 00:53:46.953
<i>His seven-year civil war
has been described</i>

690
00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.915
<i>as a relentless campaign
of sadistic wanton violence.</i>

691
00:53:51.082 --> 00:53:53.710
<i>That kind of sums up Andy for me.</i>

692
00:53:56.629 --> 00:53:58.423
The Glock is interesting.

693
00:53:59.507 --> 00:54:01.259
It's made of a polymer composite.

694
00:54:01.426 --> 00:54:03.803
Clients feel they can
get through airport security

695
00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:07.849
without setting off a lot of bells and
whistles. I do not recommend that.

696
00:54:08.016 --> 00:54:12.312
On the other hand, if you are looking
for a traditional wheel gun,

697
00:54:12.479 --> 00:54:15.023
there is no substitute for
the six inches of muzzle energy

698
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:16.316
of the .357 Magnum.

699
00:54:16.483 --> 00:54:19.027
And, of course, it will never jam.

700
00:54:22.322 --> 00:54:25.033
- Why'd you do that?!
- What did you say?

701
00:54:26.785 --> 00:54:29.454
Well, now you're gonna have to buy it.
It's a used gun.

702
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.375
How can I sell a used gun?

703
00:54:35.752 --> 00:54:38.129
A used gun.

704
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.256
A used gun.

705
00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:45.011
That's a good one.

706
00:54:46.221 --> 00:54:49.849
You know, there is no discipline
with the youth today.

707
00:54:50.016 --> 00:54:54.062
I try to set an example,
but it is difficult.

708
00:54:54.771 --> 00:54:56.564
Personally, I blame MTV.

709
00:55:00.944 --> 00:55:03.238
A used gun.

710
00:55:04.489 --> 00:55:06.574
(Uaughs)

711
00:55:06.741 --> 00:55:09.577
I think you and I,

712
00:55:09.744 --> 00:55:11.079
we can do business.

713
00:55:12.831 --> 00:55:15.083
<i>If I thought
I was scared of Andre Sr.,</i>

714
00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:17.836
<i>I knew I was scared of Andre Jr.</i>

715
00:55:18.002 --> 00:55:22.799
<i>Like father like son. The guava
doesn't fall too far from the tree.</i>

716
00:55:22.966 --> 00:55:24.801
<i>He was also a cannibal.</i>

717
00:55:24.968 --> 00:55:28.179
<i>They say Andre would eat a victim's
heart while it was still beating</i>

718
00:55:28.346 --> 00:55:30.890
<i>to give him superhuman strength.</i>

719
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:43.111
<i>Monrovia itself was like being
on another planet. Planet Monrovia.</i>

720
00:55:43.278 --> 00:55:47.699
<i>From the temperature, it was
obviously a planet close to the sun.</i>

721
00:55:47.866 --> 00:55:51.327
<i>I rarely saw another white man
and I never left town alone.</i>

722
00:55:51.494 --> 00:55:53.663
<i>Outside town was the edge of hell.</i>

723
00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:55.874
<i>I didn't want to even gaze into it.</i>

724
00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.127
This is your hotel.

725
00:55:59.294 --> 00:56:00.795
Two stars.

726
00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:05.633
- Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?
- Part one, two or three?

727
00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.553
- I've only seen part one.
- The M-60.

728
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.680
Would you like
armor-piercing bullets?

729
00:56:10.847 --> 00:56:12.265
Please.

730
00:56:13.641 --> 00:56:18.438
My father left a welcoming present
in your room. Enjoy.

731
00:56:18.605 --> 00:56:20.732
(Uaughs)

732
00:56:33.328 --> 00:56:37.457
My God,
she nearly got her head cut off.

733
00:56:38.416 --> 00:56:42.670
When I get to America,
I will not live in Brentwood.

734
00:56:43.671 --> 00:56:45.173
Second floor.

735
00:56:50.053 --> 00:56:52.513
<i>In the most AIDS-infested region
of the globe,</i>

736
00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.849
<i>where one in four is infected,</i>

737
00:56:55.016 --> 00:56:59.520
<i>Andre's idea of a joke was to put
a young lman and Naomi in my bed</i>

738
00:56:59.687 --> 00:57:02.357
<i>and no condom within 100 miles.</i>

739
00:57:02.523 --> 00:57:04.525
<i>♪ Yes</i>

740
00:57:04.692 --> 00:57:08.655
<i>♪ Give me a reason to love you</i>

741
00:57:12.784 --> 00:57:15.536
<i>♪ Give me a reason</i>

742
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:18.706
Hello, Mr. Yuri.

743
00:57:19.832 --> 00:57:21.042
Hi.

744
00:57:21.209 --> 00:57:23.753
We'd be happy to make you happy.

745
00:57:25.046 --> 00:57:27.632
Uh... I can't.

746
00:57:27.799 --> 00:57:31.427
I'd love to, but I can't.

747
00:57:31.594 --> 00:57:35.098
Don't worry.
We don't have anything.

748
00:57:38.184 --> 00:57:39.769
Oh.

749
00:57:39.936 --> 00:57:42.605
How do you know?

750
00:57:43.898 --> 00:57:45.566
Do we look like it?

751
00:57:45.733 --> 00:57:48.653
What if I have AIDS? Don't you worry?

752
00:57:50.029 --> 00:57:52.407
You worry too much.

753
00:57:52.573 --> 00:57:57.078
Why do you worry about something
that can kill you in 10 years

754
00:57:57.245 --> 00:58:00.748
when there's so many things
that can kill you today?

755
00:58:03.418 --> 00:58:05.461
Now...

756
00:58:06.462 --> 00:58:08.756
how can we make you happy?

757
00:58:11.843 --> 00:58:13.136
By leaving.

758
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:20.935
These are my Kalashnikov Kids,

759
00:58:21.102 --> 00:58:23.980
my Boy Brigades.

760
00:58:24.939 --> 00:58:29.027
I can see what you are thinking,
but we need every man we can get.

761
00:58:29.193 --> 00:58:31.112
Even if they're not men?

762
00:58:31.279 --> 00:58:36.784
A bullet from a 14-year-old is just
as effective as one from a 40-year-old.

763
00:58:36.951 --> 00:58:39.120
Often more effective.

764
00:58:42.498 --> 00:58:44.792
No one can stop this bath of blood.

765
00:58:44.959 --> 00:58:47.128
It's not "bath of blood",
it's "bloodbath".

766
00:58:47.837 --> 00:58:50.631
Thank you,

767
00:58:50.798 --> 00:58:53.801
but I prefer it my way.

768
00:59:05.354 --> 00:59:07.565
I am not going to pay
your asking price.

769
00:59:07.732 --> 00:59:09.859
We are not a rich people.
And besides,

770
00:59:10.026 --> 00:59:13.237
the market is already flooded
with your Kalashnikovs.

771
00:59:13.404 --> 00:59:17.200
In some parts of my country, you can
get one for the price of a chicken.

772
00:59:17.366 --> 00:59:20.578
You can't just look at the unit price.
You forget ancillary costs.

773
00:59:20.745 --> 00:59:23.998
End-user certificates need to be forged,
shell companies set up,

774
00:59:24.165 --> 00:59:28.086
insurance purchased, pilots and crews
hired. Not to mention the bribes.

775
00:59:28.252 --> 00:59:31.172
You can't get a nut and bolt
out of the Eastern Bloc without a bribe.

776
00:59:31.339 --> 00:59:34.509
There's one bribe for the nut,
another for the bolt.

777
00:59:34.675 --> 00:59:38.346
Andy, Andy, listen to me.
This is an expensive proposition.

778
00:59:38.513 --> 00:59:41.057
Andy?

779
00:59:41.224 --> 00:59:45.019
I am going to pay you in timber.

780
00:59:47.063 --> 00:59:49.565
Or stones.

781
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.693
I'll take the stones.

782
00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:56.155
It's kind of hard to get
a tree trunk into my hand luggage.

783
00:59:57.073 --> 00:59:59.534
I know you're planning
a new offensive.

784
00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:03.204
If you can delay a week I can get you
armored personnel carriers.

785
01:00:03.371 --> 01:00:06.207
They'd greatly reduce
your casualties

786
01:00:06.374 --> 01:00:08.709
and give you a significant
strategic advantage.

787
01:00:11.003 --> 01:00:14.215
You know, they call me
the Lord of War,

788
01:00:14.382 --> 01:00:16.050
but perhaps it is you.

789
01:00:16.801 --> 01:00:19.887
It's not "Lord of War".
It's "Warlord".

790
01:00:21.722 --> 01:00:24.725
Thank you,
but I prefer it my way.

791
01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.562
(Uaughs)

792
01:00:27.728 --> 01:00:30.898
<i>Conflict diamonds are
a common currency in West Africa.</i>

793
01:00:31.065 --> 01:00:32.942
<i>Also referred to
as "blood diamonds",</i>

794
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:36.946
<i>since bloodshed is what
they generally finance.</i>

795
01:00:37.113 --> 01:00:40.992
<i>By the late '90s, my wealth had
caught up to my lies about my wealth.</i>

796
01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:43.077
<i>Even surpassed my lies.</i>

797
01:00:43.244 --> 01:00:46.455
<i>I could even afford
to become a patron of the arts.</i>

798
01:00:55.006 --> 01:00:57.216
I can't believe it.

799
01:00:57.383 --> 01:01:00.261
Well, of course
it's wonderful. I just...

800
01:01:00.428 --> 01:01:04.098
I didn't expect it
to happen so soon.

801
01:01:04.265 --> 01:01:05.933
Yes, well, that...

802
01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.270
well, that would
be great, too, yeah.

803
01:01:10.271 --> 01:01:12.440
It's wonderful.
Thank you so much.

804
01:01:12.607 --> 01:01:15.693
It's... Yuri.
OK, thank you. Bye.

805
01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:19.363
Yuri, that was the dealer on the phone.
I just sold my first painting.

806
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:23.284
That's fantastic! Who bought it?

807
01:01:23.451 --> 01:01:26.454
Someone important.
They wanna remain anonymous.

808
01:01:26.621 --> 01:01:28.831
- This is so wonderful.
- Yeah, how was your trip?

809
01:01:28.998 --> 01:01:31.334
You know, same old, same old.
Where's Nicki?

810
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.628
In bed. I'm sorry.
He couldn't stay up.

811
01:01:33.794 --> 01:01:36.297
- Well, that's best.
- My first painting.

812
01:01:36.464 --> 01:01:38.341
I'm officially an artist.

813
01:01:38.507 --> 01:01:41.636
- This calls for a drink.
- What doesn't?

814
01:01:42.553 --> 01:01:43.721
Hi.

815
01:01:43.888 --> 01:01:46.557
- Yuri, this is, uh, uh...
- Candy.

816
01:01:46.724 --> 01:01:49.769
- Candy, of course.
- Hi.

817
01:01:49.936 --> 01:01:54.023
Any friend of my brother's...
is a friend of my brother's.

818
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:57.777
You have a beautiful everything.

819
01:01:59.153 --> 01:02:01.822
- Yes, he does.
- Yes, I do.

820
01:02:01.989 --> 01:02:04.700
- I'm gonna kiss Nicki good night.
- OK.

821
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.675
- How are you, brother?
- Oh, you know...

822
01:03:02.842 --> 01:03:05.553
still the resident family fuck up.

823
01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.265
Yeah, well, I guess
someone has to do it.

824
01:03:09.432 --> 01:03:11.642
Yeah.

825
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:15.396
Hey, Ava knows, right?

826
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:22.862
I never want to say anything.

827
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:25.114
She doesn't have to know.
She understands.

828
01:03:25.281 --> 01:03:27.742
She's a survivor, like me.

829
01:03:27.908 --> 01:03:32.747
Well, she may be a survivor,
but she's not like you.

830
01:03:34.874 --> 01:03:36.584
She doesn't know
how you pay for this?

831
01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:39.295
We don't talk about it.

832
01:03:39.462 --> 01:03:42.673
How many car salesmen
talk about their work, huh?

833
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.344
How many cigarette salesmen? Their
products kill more people than mine.

834
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:50.056
At least mine
has a safety switch.

835
01:03:50.222 --> 01:03:54.101
If those guys can leave
their work at the office, so can I.

836
01:03:55.728 --> 01:03:58.773
Goddamn, you are good.

837
01:04:00.566 --> 01:04:02.068
You really are.

838
01:04:02.234 --> 01:04:05.529
You almost had me convinced.

839
01:04:15.998 --> 01:04:18.125
Could you, uh...

840
01:04:20.169 --> 01:04:22.963
could you help me out
with some...

841
01:04:28.761 --> 01:04:30.805
Why?

842
01:04:31.972 --> 01:04:34.433
Why?

843
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.310
Why?

844
01:04:36.894 --> 01:04:38.646
Why what?

845
01:04:38.813 --> 01:04:41.899
- Why, why, why, why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

846
01:04:42.066 --> 01:04:44.151
Why what?

847
01:04:45.027 --> 01:04:47.113
Why are you so fucked up
all the time?

848
01:04:52.868 --> 01:04:55.663
Because I am.

849
01:05:05.047 --> 01:05:06.924
<i>I didn't know how much
Ava really knew</i>

850
01:05:07.091 --> 01:05:09.343
<i>and how much she ignored.</i>

851
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:11.929
<i>She never questioned
how a guy in transport</i>

852
01:05:12.096 --> 01:05:15.391
<i>could afford to give her
18-carat diamond earrings.</i>

853
01:05:15.558 --> 01:05:18.686
<i>I guess she didn't really want
to hear the answer.</i>

854
01:05:18.853 --> 01:05:21.647
<i>Mostly, she seemed content
that I was a good provider,</i>

855
01:05:21.814 --> 01:05:24.525
<i>and, as far
as she was concerned, loyal.</i>

856
01:05:24.692 --> 01:05:26.193
<i>Despite the other women,</i>

857
01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.364
<i>I always made love to Ava
as if she was the only one.</i>

858
01:05:33.617 --> 01:05:35.536
<i>I'm not saying
I didn't have setbacks.</i>

859
01:05:35.703 --> 01:05:39.290
<i>It's not called "gunrunning" for
nothing. You gotta be fast on your feet.</i>

860
01:05:39.457 --> 01:05:42.543
<i>Some revolutions blow over
before the guns even get there.</i>

861
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:45.796
<i>There's nothing more expensive
for an arms dealer than peace.</i>

862
01:05:45.963 --> 01:05:48.215
Truce? What do you mean "truce"?

863
01:05:48.382 --> 01:05:51.051
The guns are already
on their way.

864
01:05:51.552 --> 01:05:53.846
"Peace talks."

865
01:05:54.013 --> 01:05:56.724
All right, forget it. I'll reroute
the shipment to the Balkans.

866
01:05:56.891 --> 01:05:59.894
When they say they're gonna
have a war, they keep their word.

867
01:06:07.234 --> 01:06:11.906
<i>Of course, a new breed of gunrunner
requires a new breed of cop.</i>

868
01:06:16.243 --> 01:06:18.746
Henry, take Park Avenue.

869
01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:38.766
Take 'em on a tour
of New Jersey.

870
01:07:12.841 --> 01:07:14.468
Yuri...

871
01:07:14.635 --> 01:07:17.179
there are men
going through our garbage cans.

872
01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.975
It's probably just reporters
looking for somebody else.

873
01:07:21.141 --> 01:07:24.520
I have a feeling
they don't work for the tabloids.

874
01:07:25.938 --> 01:07:27.982
Yuri...

875
01:07:29.149 --> 01:07:31.443
is there anything
I should be worried about?

876
01:07:32.903 --> 01:07:33.903
No, nothing.

877
01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:36.824
<i>- Nothing.
- I love you.</i>

878
01:07:38.158 --> 01:07:39.493
I love you too.

879
01:07:44.039 --> 01:07:45.207
Sir.

880
01:08:33.881 --> 01:08:35.561
<i>I was now the best
merchant of death alive.</i>

881
01:08:35.674 --> 01:08:37.926
<i>I didn't own my own plane.
I owned a fleet.</i>

882
01:08:38.093 --> 01:08:43.057
<i>Running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone
or the Ivory Coast at least once a week.</i>

883
01:08:43.223 --> 01:08:45.559
<i>Most trips, I had phony paperwork.</i>

884
01:08:45.726 --> 01:08:48.062
<i>If the deadline was tight
and I had to cut corners,</i>

885
01:08:48.228 --> 01:08:50.898
<i>I had no papenlvork at all.</i>

886
01:08:52.733 --> 01:08:54.318
<i>But I wasn't overly concerned.</i>

887
01:08:54.485 --> 01:08:56.612
<i>There was hardly any radar
over most of Africa,</i>

888
01:08:56.779 --> 01:08:58.697
<i>and even fewer people
to watch it.</i>

889
01:09:04.119 --> 01:09:05.746
<i>Charlie, Echo, India.</i>

890
01:09:05.913 --> 01:09:10.167
Reroute to Kabala airport
on heading 0-2-9.

891
01:09:10.334 --> 01:09:11.710
Comply immediately.

892
01:09:25.391 --> 01:09:29.478
Colonel Southern, I'm sorry to call you,
but I've got Interpol all over my ass.

893
01:09:29.645 --> 01:09:33.107
I can't know you right now.
It's not a good time.

894
01:09:35.442 --> 01:09:36.527
Not a good time?

895
01:09:46.036 --> 01:09:48.664
Charlie, Echo, India,
comply immediately.

896
01:09:48.831 --> 01:09:51.500
<i>- This is your last warning.
- Where was the first warning?</i>

897
01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:53.460
<i>Rock your wings
if you intend to comply.</i>

898
01:09:53.627 --> 01:09:54.878
I'm putting us down.

899
01:10:00.342 --> 01:10:02.678
You land, we're going away.
I don't have paperwork.

900
01:10:02.845 --> 01:10:05.639
- We're in a flying bomb.
- They're firing bullets at our bullets.

901
01:10:05.806 --> 01:10:09.727
- I'm putting us down.
- OK, OK, fuck!

902
01:10:10.477 --> 01:10:11.854
This is Charlie, Echo, India.

903
01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.774
Request to reroute
to Kabala airport on bearing 0-2-9.

904
01:10:15.941 --> 01:10:19.653
No, not the airport. There, the highway.
It's our only hope.

905
01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:23.490
Are you fucking mad?
A pothole will set us off.

906
01:10:23.657 --> 01:10:26.326
You underestimate yourself, Aleksei.
You're the best.

907
01:10:26.493 --> 01:10:29.496
You're the shit, Aleksei.
You're the shit! You're the shit!

908
01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:33.000
<i>Of course,
Aleksei wasn't the best.</i>

909
01:10:33.167 --> 01:10:36.628
<i>He'd come 42nd out of 43
at the Moscow Flight School.</i>

910
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:48.682
Oh, God, what's he doing?
Is this guy nuts?

911
01:10:50.726 --> 01:10:52.019
I can't land there, sir.

912
01:10:52.186 --> 01:10:55.022
Kabala's only 15 minutes away.
He can't get far.

913
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:57.858
I want a truck on the tarmac.

914
01:12:13.934 --> 01:12:16.395
We're gonna be OK.

915
01:12:17.604 --> 01:12:20.607
- Where you going?
- As far from the evidence as we can.

916
01:12:20.774 --> 01:12:22.985
Wait, there's not gonna be
any evidence.

917
01:12:38.792 --> 01:12:41.461
Come here, come here.

918
01:12:43.297 --> 01:12:46.300
Hey, don't be shy.
Here, look. Free sample.

919
01:12:46.466 --> 01:12:49.219
Help yourself, OK?
Free sample. Tell your friends.

920
01:12:49.678 --> 01:12:53.140
Come here. You want something?
Want an RPG? All for you. All right?

921
01:12:53.307 --> 01:12:55.559
Happy times. Come on.
Help yourselves.

922
01:12:55.726 --> 01:12:57.686
No charge. Everything goes.

923
01:12:57.853 --> 01:13:00.647
Guns, guns, guns.
Yeah, come on up!

924
01:13:00.814 --> 01:13:02.691
Yeah, having fun now, huh?

925
01:13:04.776 --> 01:13:08.322
Come on. Guns, guns, guns! Yeah!

926
01:13:08.488 --> 01:13:10.908
Bullets, guns, grenades.

927
01:13:11.074 --> 01:13:14.077
Hooray, yeah, take 'em all.
Take the whole crate.

928
01:13:14.244 --> 01:13:17.998
Go ahead, take the crate.
Everybody, come on.

929
01:13:18.999 --> 01:13:21.335
Guns, grenades, hooray!

930
01:13:21.501 --> 01:13:23.962
Bullets, guns, grenades!

931
01:13:25.422 --> 01:13:26.422
Yeah!

932
01:13:26.548 --> 01:13:27.925
That one's got your name on it.

933
01:13:28.091 --> 01:13:32.512
You want one, too? Come on. We got
bullets. Don't forget the bullets.

934
01:13:32.679 --> 01:13:35.182
How can you shoot a gun
if you don't have bullets?

935
01:13:35.349 --> 01:13:37.517
Everything goes for free.

936
01:13:37.684 --> 01:13:40.437
Guns, grenades, RPGs,

937
01:13:40.604 --> 01:13:43.190
bullets, guns, yeah!

938
01:13:43.357 --> 01:13:46.652
Hooray, hooray!
Want some bullets?

939
01:13:46.818 --> 01:13:48.278
Gotta have bullets.

940
01:13:48.445 --> 01:13:51.698
<i>What a cargo crew
at Heathrow Airport does in a day</i>

941
01:13:51.865 --> 01:13:56.954
<i>took a bunch of malnourished
Sierra Leonean locals 10 minutes.</i>

942
01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.081
<i>By the time Agent Valentine
got there,</i>

943
01:13:59.247 --> 01:14:01.875
<i>you could find more guns
on a plane full of Quakers.</i>

944
01:14:09.549 --> 01:14:11.218
Yuri Orlov.

945
01:14:11.718 --> 01:14:14.513
- Ow, fuck!
- You run from us?

946
01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.056
No, Mbizi, no.

947
01:14:16.223 --> 01:14:17.683
Can he run with no legs?

948
01:14:18.892 --> 01:14:22.062
Let me make him disappear.
Here, people disappear all the time.

949
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:25.023
- I can't do that.
- Look where we are.

950
01:14:25.190 --> 01:14:27.317
Who will know?

951
01:14:28.735 --> 01:14:29.736
We will.

952
01:14:36.827 --> 01:14:38.412
He's gonna get
what's coming to him.

953
01:14:39.079 --> 01:14:40.414
I'm not as certain.

954
01:14:49.089 --> 01:14:51.258
All right, get up.

955
01:14:54.845 --> 01:14:57.848
- What's the charge?
- What are you doing in Sierra Leone?

956
01:14:58.015 --> 01:15:00.267
- I'm on safari.
- Yeah?

957
01:15:00.434 --> 01:15:03.854
You're hunting wildebeests
with a submachine gun?

958
01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:07.774
Do you work with the Park Service?
Hunting without a license the charge?

959
01:15:07.941 --> 01:15:11.528
Why are we playing games?
You traffic arms.

960
01:15:11.695 --> 01:15:14.573
- Trade.
- Trade, traffic.

961
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:18.452
You get rich by giving
the poorest people on the planet

962
01:15:18.618 --> 01:15:20.162
the means to kill each other.

963
01:15:20.328 --> 01:15:21.830
Do you know why I do what I do?

964
01:15:21.997 --> 01:15:24.958
I mean, there are more
prestigious assignments.

965
01:15:25.125 --> 01:15:26.752
Keeping track
of nuclear arsenals.

966
01:15:26.918 --> 01:15:30.172
You'd think that more critical
to world security, but it's not.

967
01:15:30.338 --> 01:15:32.382
No, nine out often
war victims today

968
01:15:32.549 --> 01:15:36.136
are killed with assault rifles
and small arms like yours.

969
01:15:36.303 --> 01:15:38.263
Those nuclear missiles
sit in their silos.

970
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:42.309
Your AK-47, that is the real weapon
of mass destruction.

971
01:15:43.268 --> 01:15:45.812
I don't want people dead,
Agent Valentine.

972
01:15:45.979 --> 01:15:48.940
I don't put a gun to anybody's head
and make them shoot.

973
01:15:49.107 --> 01:15:51.568
I admit, a shooting war's
better for business,

974
01:15:51.735 --> 01:15:54.154
but I prefer people
to fire my guns and miss,

975
01:15:54.321 --> 01:15:56.990
just as long as they're firing.

976
01:16:05.373 --> 01:16:08.919
Can I go now?
You've got nothing on me.

977
01:16:09.086 --> 01:16:10.962
Except cuffs.

978
01:16:13.882 --> 01:16:15.759
Since you're so concerned
with the law,

979
01:16:15.926 --> 01:16:19.805
you must know I'm legally permitted
to hold you for 24 hours

980
01:16:19.971 --> 01:16:23.225
without charging you.
You might ask why I would do that.

981
01:16:23.391 --> 01:16:27.312
I can assure you it's not because
I enjoy your company, because I don't.

982
01:16:27.479 --> 01:16:32.442
No. The reason I will delay you for
every second of the permissible 24 hours

983
01:16:32.609 --> 01:16:37.030
is I am delaying your deadly trade
and the deaths of your victims.

984
01:16:37.197 --> 01:16:40.867
I don't think of it as taking a day
from you, but giving a day to them.

985
01:16:41.034 --> 01:16:43.161
Some innocent man, woman or child

986
01:16:43.328 --> 01:16:45.539
is going to have
an extra day on this earth

987
01:16:45.705 --> 01:16:47.541
because you're not free.

988
01:16:49.084 --> 01:16:51.878
So, I will see you...

989
01:16:52.045 --> 01:16:54.297
in 23 hours

990
01:16:54.464 --> 01:16:56.883
and 55 minutes, huh?

991
01:17:01.721 --> 01:17:03.723
<i>Valentine knew
he didn't have to guard me.</i>

992
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:06.393
<i>There was nowhere to go.</i>

993
01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:09.938
<i>Or maybe he was hoping
the locals would tear me apart.</i>

994
01:17:10.105 --> 01:17:12.566
<i>But they were too busy with the plane.</i>

995
01:17:15.068 --> 01:17:18.780
<i>It's like parking your car
in certain neighborhoods in the Bronx.</i>

996
01:17:18.947 --> 01:17:20.699
<i>You just don't do it.</i>

997
01:17:32.085 --> 01:17:35.297
<i>The way I look at it,
it's the way of Africa,</i>

998
01:17:35.463 --> 01:17:37.132
<i>maybe life.</i>

999
01:17:37.299 --> 01:17:40.969
<i>Everything that comes from the earth
eventually returns.</i>

1000
01:17:41.136 --> 01:17:44.472
<i>Even a 40-ton
Atonov-12 cargo plane.</i>

1001
01:18:41.696 --> 01:18:44.824
A gift for you.

1002
01:18:46.868 --> 01:18:49.204
You know,
you've arrived just in time.

1003
01:18:49.371 --> 01:18:51.456
I was afraid that he might die

1004
01:18:51.623 --> 01:18:54.125
before you got your chance...

1005
01:18:54.292 --> 01:18:56.294
to kill him.

1006
01:19:01.174 --> 01:19:04.010
This man came here

1007
01:19:04.511 --> 01:19:07.138
hoping to take your place.

1008
01:19:10.308 --> 01:19:12.519
Is that not so?

1009
01:19:23.196 --> 01:19:26.032
No, I'm not here
to supply Mr. Baptiste.

1010
01:19:27.701 --> 01:19:30.537
I am hereto supply his enemies.

1011
01:19:34.124 --> 01:19:37.585
I fear it's a sale
I shall never complete.

1012
01:19:39.921 --> 01:19:42.674
He killed your blood,

1013
01:19:42.841 --> 01:19:44.718
your uncle,

1014
01:19:44.884 --> 01:19:47.721
when he tried to kill you.

1015
01:19:55.687 --> 01:19:58.106
- No.

1016
01:20:01.234 --> 01:20:03.653
You want that I should let him go?

1017
01:20:05.697 --> 01:20:09.534
- No, I...
- "No no,

1018
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:13.580
You do want him dead.

1019
01:20:13.747 --> 01:20:16.416
You just...

1020
01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:19.085
don't want to have to do it yourself.

1021
01:20:24.632 --> 01:20:26.760
So...

1022
01:20:27.427 --> 01:20:29.054
we will do this together.

1023
01:20:33.641 --> 01:20:36.728
This will be

1024
01:20:37.979 --> 01:20:40.815
a bonding experience.

1025
01:20:45.779 --> 01:20:48.698
You know that you can stop this
anytime that you want.

1026
01:20:48.865 --> 01:20:51.201
But I don't think that you do.

1027
01:20:51.368 --> 01:20:52.619
Just say the word.

1028
01:20:54.245 --> 01:20:57.123
<i>Say “$109.</i>

1029
01:21:10.553 --> 01:21:12.639
Stop.

1030
01:21:13.556 --> 01:21:16.059
(Uaughs)

1031
01:21:22.148 --> 01:21:25.402
I will get you another room,
my friend.

1032
01:21:25.568 --> 01:21:28.321
With a much nicer view.

1033
01:22:00.645 --> 01:22:03.648
He ordered you brown-brown,
Mr. Yuri.

1034
01:22:06.734 --> 01:22:08.862
- What?
- Brown-brown.

1035
01:22:09.028 --> 01:22:12.699
- What is it?
- It's a mixture of cocaine

1036
01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:15.535
and gunpowder.

1037
01:22:16.369 --> 01:22:19.247
They give it to young boys before
battle. They do anything.

1038
01:22:21.916 --> 01:22:23.626
Some other time.

1039
01:22:23.793 --> 01:22:27.380
I suggest you try it
at least once, Mr. Yuri.

1040
01:22:28.131 --> 01:22:29.549
Why?

1041
01:22:29.716 --> 01:22:32.427
Because it's your gunpowder.

1042
01:22:33.011 --> 01:22:34.888
(Uaughs)

1043
01:22:48.067 --> 01:22:49.694
All right.

1044
01:22:54.741 --> 01:22:55.909
<i>Even before that night</i>

1045
01:22:56.075 --> 01:22:59.287
<i>I started doing a lot of cocaine
in West Africa.</i>

1046
01:22:59.454 --> 01:23:01.748
<i>I'd never tried
brown-brown before.</i>

1047
01:23:01.915 --> 01:23:04.083
<i>But then I never killed a man either.</i>

1048
01:23:08.087 --> 01:23:09.422
Here we go. Come on!

1049
01:23:29.442 --> 01:23:32.278
Oh, I didn't do anything, did I?

1050
01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.121
Wait, are you sick? SIDA?

1051
01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:43.998
AIDS?

1052
01:23:45.291 --> 01:23:48.628
Ask the white man. He will know.

1053
01:23:48.795 --> 01:23:50.755
Sir, will my hand grow back?

1054
01:23:59.722 --> 01:24:02.892
- Simeon?
- Remember, Yuri.

1055
01:24:03.059 --> 01:24:05.478
Take sides.

1056
01:24:07.522 --> 01:24:09.607
Simeon!

1057
01:24:12.402 --> 01:24:13.987
Don't! He's Andre's.

1058
01:24:14.153 --> 01:24:17.282
- Fuck Andre.
- Yeah, fuck Andre.

1059
01:24:19.993 --> 01:24:22.912
I'm sorry.
They don't usually do that.

1060
01:24:24.539 --> 01:24:26.833
Well, let me look at it.
Maybe I can fix it.

1061
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.627
Let me see it.
It's the magazine. Give it to me.

1062
01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:32.922
"<i>'</i> FUCK you!

1063
01:24:58.906 --> 01:25:01.534
<i>I started to feel I'd been cursed.</i>

1064
01:25:01.701 --> 01:25:03.828
<i>The curse of invincibility.</i>

1065
01:25:08.124 --> 01:25:10.084
Nicki, please go to your room.

1066
01:25:13.713 --> 01:25:15.006
I don't believe you.

1067
01:25:16.549 --> 01:25:17.717
Can you prove any of this?

1068
01:25:19.469 --> 01:25:23.973
Mr. Orlov goes to a lot of trouble
to make his business look legitimate.

1069
01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:27.935
Even to you.
Perhaps especially to you.

1070
01:25:28.102 --> 01:25:30.980
I don't expect we're gonna find
anything here today.

1071
01:25:31.147 --> 01:25:32.523
So what do you want?

1072
01:25:35.234 --> 01:25:37.236
I was hoping that you would help me.

1073
01:25:44.619 --> 01:25:47.330
I understand that, uh...

1074
01:25:47.497 --> 01:25:50.083
your parents died tragically.

1075
01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:57.507
The illegal firearms used
to murder your mother and father

1076
01:25:57.674 --> 01:26:00.760
were procured from men
exactly like your husband.

1077
01:26:03.304 --> 01:26:05.056
I'd like you to leave.

1078
01:26:08.726 --> 01:26:11.104
OK. Gentlemen.

1079
01:26:25.868 --> 01:26:28.246
Ava?

1080
01:26:36.671 --> 01:26:38.297
Ava. What's wrong?

1081
01:26:39.632 --> 01:26:41.801
I can't wear the clothes.

1082
01:26:42.468 --> 01:26:44.887
I can't wear the jewelry.

1083
01:26:45.888 --> 01:26:48.266
I can't drive the car.

1084
01:26:50.059 --> 01:26:51.811
Can't live in this house.

1085
01:26:51.978 --> 01:26:54.021
Everything's got blood on it.

1086
01:26:54.188 --> 01:26:56.399
Blood on it?

1087
01:26:57.984 --> 01:27:00.820
What's the matter with you?

1088
01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:06.784
- Don't be so melodramatic.
- Of course I'm melodramatic.

1089
01:27:06.951 --> 01:27:09.996
I'm a failed actress, remember?

1090
01:27:18.129 --> 01:27:20.715
I told you,
these people, it's political.

1091
01:27:20.882 --> 01:27:22.842
They lie. They're liars.

1092
01:27:23.009 --> 01:27:25.845
Look at me. Look. They lie
to make themselves look good, OK?

1093
01:27:26.012 --> 01:27:27.805
You can't...
you can't trust them.

1094
01:27:27.972 --> 01:27:30.641
It's not just them.

1095
01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.980
Don't worry.
Your family didn't say anything.

1096
01:27:36.147 --> 01:27:38.858
They didn't have to.

1097
01:27:39.942 --> 01:27:45.031
I sell people a means to defend
themselves, Ava. That's all.

1098
01:27:45.198 --> 01:27:46.949
Yuri, I see the news.

1099
01:27:47.116 --> 01:27:50.953
I see those pictures.
The guns are bigger than the boys.

1100
01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:53.331
There is nothing illegal
about what I do.

1101
01:27:53.498 --> 01:27:56.042
I don't care if it's legal.

1102
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:57.543
It's wrong.

1103
01:28:17.230 --> 01:28:19.357
Please stop.

1104
01:28:22.443 --> 01:28:24.237
It makes no difference if I stop.

1105
01:28:25.363 --> 01:28:27.198
Someone will take my place
the next clay.

1106
01:28:27.365 --> 01:28:30.493
So let them. We have enough.

1107
01:28:32.078 --> 01:28:34.789
It's not about the money.

1108
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:38.084
Then what is it?

1109
01:28:41.587 --> 01:28:43.548
I'm good at it.

1110
01:28:53.307 --> 01:28:57.645
I feel like all I've clone
my whole life is be pretty.

1111
01:28:57.812 --> 01:29:00.189
I mean,

1112
01:29:00.356 --> 01:29:03.192
all I've done is be born.

1113
01:29:03.359 --> 01:29:06.904
I'm a failed actress,
a failed artist.

1114
01:29:07.738 --> 01:29:10.783
I'm not much good as a mother.

1115
01:29:12.577 --> 01:29:16.831
Come to think of it,
I'm not even that pretty anymore.

1116
01:29:18.791 --> 01:29:22.628
I have failed at everything, Yuri.

1117
01:29:24.463 --> 01:29:27.258
But I won't fail as a human being.

1118
01:29:31.888 --> 01:29:35.474
<i>My enemies had finally found
a weapon that could hurt me.</i>

1119
01:29:36.976 --> 01:29:39.186
<i>For the next six months
I stopped running guns.</i>

1120
01:29:39.353 --> 01:29:41.522
<i>- I went legitimate.
- This is an untapped market.</i>

1121
01:29:41.689 --> 01:29:44.483
I'm talking over five million
cubic meters of timber

1122
01:29:44.650 --> 01:29:45.651
in the first year alone.

1123
01:29:45.818 --> 01:29:47.987
Over 100 exploitable species.

1124
01:29:48.154 --> 01:29:50.823
<i>The oil? Between you and me,
this is the new Texas.</i>

1125
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:53.743
<i>What do you say to over
10,000 barrels a month?</i>

1126
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:56.329
He must be lying.

1127
01:29:56.495 --> 01:29:58.039
He's talking.

1128
01:29:58.205 --> 01:30:01.208
<i>There's gas reserves off the Ivory Coast
OPEC doesn't know about.</i>

1129
01:30:01.375 --> 01:30:04.211
The phone numbers all check out.

1130
01:30:05.504 --> 01:30:06.881
It's all on the level.

1131
01:30:08.341 --> 01:30:11.260
<i>No wonder Valentine was confused.</i>

1132
01:30:24.523 --> 01:30:28.569
<i>Thank God there are still legal ways
to exploit developing countries.</i>

1133
01:30:28.736 --> 01:30:32.239
<i>But the only problem with an honest
buck is they're so hard to make.</i>

1134
01:30:32.406 --> 01:30:36.702
<i>The margins are too low.
Too many people are doing it.</i>

1135
01:30:40.081 --> 01:30:43.501
<i>Still, I'd promised Ava.</i>

1136
01:30:52.218 --> 01:30:55.179
Yuri, the president of Liberia
is on his way up.

1137
01:30:57.473 --> 01:30:58.599
He's early.

1138
01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:02.311
- I'll be back in a minute.
- OK.

1139
01:31:08.192 --> 01:31:10.403
What the fuck
are you doing here, Andre?

1140
01:31:10.569 --> 01:31:12.405
Peace talks at the United Nations.

1141
01:31:12.571 --> 01:31:14.740
So you thought you'd drop in
on your arms dealer?

1142
01:31:14.907 --> 01:31:18.536
Well, I was beginning to wonder
whether that was still your profession.

1143
01:31:18.703 --> 01:31:21.288
You know you're a hard man
to get a hold of all of a sudden.

1144
01:31:22.081 --> 01:31:23.708
That is a shame.

1145
01:31:23.874 --> 01:31:28.754
My son and I were hoping to do a little
shopping while we are in New York.

1146
01:31:28.921 --> 01:31:31.590
- You know they're watching you.
- I know they blame me.

1147
01:31:31.757 --> 01:31:34.218
They blame me for everything,
those hypocrites.

1148
01:31:34.385 --> 01:31:37.430
- They're on a hunt for a witch.
- "Witch hunt."

1149
01:31:37.596 --> 01:31:40.266
Hostilities have escalated.

1150
01:31:40.433 --> 01:31:43.644
They are making it very difficult
for me to resupply.

1151
01:31:43.811 --> 01:31:46.272
That requires a man

1152
01:31:46.439 --> 01:31:48.941
of your rare ingenuity.

1153
01:31:51.402 --> 01:31:52.987
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

1154
01:32:00.119 --> 01:32:01.829
I understand.

1155
01:32:03.330 --> 01:32:04.999
But you should know this.

1156
01:32:05.166 --> 01:32:08.627
Due to our present situation,
we are compelled...

1157
01:32:08.794 --> 01:32:11.005
to be unusually generous.

1158
01:32:15.843 --> 01:32:18.763
So see you soon,

1159
01:32:18.929 --> 01:32:20.306
Lord of War.

1160
01:32:23.934 --> 01:32:26.937
You still haven't brought me
the gun of Rambo.

1161
01:32:30.316 --> 01:32:32.401
(Uaughs)

1162
01:32:43.662 --> 01:32:48.417
<i>At four and a half months old
a human fetus has a reptile's tail -</i>

1163
01:32:48.584 --> 01:32:50.503
<i>a remnant of our evolution.</i>

1164
01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:52.630
<i>Maybe that's what I couldn't escape.</i>

1165
01:32:52.797 --> 01:32:55.049
<i>You can fight
a lot of enemies and survive,</i>

1166
01:32:55.216 --> 01:32:58.010
<i>but if you fight your biology
you will always lose.</i>

1167
01:32:58.177 --> 01:33:01.180
You aren't waiting to say goodbye?
I'm not leaving for 10 minutes.

1168
01:33:01.347 --> 01:33:04.475
- Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.
- Oh, OK.

1169
01:33:04.642 --> 01:33:06.185
I'm kind of glad you're going.

1170
01:33:06.352 --> 01:33:09.063
You've been here so long
you're starting to get on my nerves.

1171
01:33:09.230 --> 01:33:11.690
This oil concession
should be wrapped up by Thursday.

1172
01:33:11.857 --> 01:33:15.111
I'll be back for the weekend.
We'll go somewhere. The sea.

1173
01:33:15.277 --> 01:33:16.904
That would be fun.

1174
01:33:17.696 --> 01:33:19.865
- Come on.
- Hey.

1175
01:33:20.032 --> 01:33:21.242
You trust me, right?

1176
01:33:23.702 --> 01:33:26.038
<i>She looked me directly in the eye
the way I have</i>

1177
01:33:26.205 --> 01:33:28.958
a <i>thousand customs officials,
government bureaucrats</i>

1178
01:33:29.125 --> 01:33:30.626
<i>and law enforcement agents.</i>

1179
01:33:30.793 --> 01:33:32.878
Yes, I trust you.

1180
01:33:33.045 --> 01:33:35.714
<i>And she lied without flinching.</i>

1181
01:33:35.881 --> 01:33:38.968
- I'll see you, big guy.
- Bye, Papa.

1182
01:33:39.135 --> 01:33:40.886
<i>She learned from the best.</i>

1183
01:33:41.053 --> 01:33:43.055
Have a good trip.

1184

Yes.

Honey, come over here.

Nicki, stay right here.

1216
01:36:58.208 --> 01:36:59.710
Come on, Nicki.

1217
01:37:12.598 --> 01:37:15.559
- Come to see how the other half lives?
- I miss your borscht.

1218
01:37:16.393 --> 01:37:19.688
- Mom and Dad say you're clean.
- Yeah, you too.

1219
01:37:20.647 --> 01:37:23.776
You went legit, huh?
That's hard to believe.

1220
01:37:23.942 --> 01:37:26.528
That's because it's not true.

1221
01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.657
Only you know.
I'm leaving tonight on a job.

1222
01:37:30.824 --> 01:37:32.117
I want you to come.

1223
01:37:34.036 --> 01:37:35.704
I can't.

1224
01:37:37.081 --> 01:37:39.291
I've got a girlfriend.

1225
01:37:39.458 --> 01:37:41.794
I think she might be the one.

1226
01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:44.463
Plus I'm thinking
of opening my own place.

1227
01:37:44.630 --> 01:37:47.633
Maybe this trip will help.
It's good money.

1228
01:37:50.636 --> 01:37:52.971
Yuri...

1229
01:37:53.138 --> 01:37:56.308
- I've given my word.
- No one has to know.

1230
01:37:56.475 --> 01:37:58.310
We'll tell them
we're going for a little R&R.

1231
01:38:01.855 --> 01:38:03.565
Why do you need me
all of a sudden?

1232
01:38:03.732 --> 01:38:06.026
West Africa's fucked up.

1233
01:38:06.193 --> 01:38:08.320
More than usual.

1234
01:38:08.487 --> 01:38:10.948
I can't trust anybody.

1235
01:38:13.409 --> 01:38:16.328
I need you to watch my back.

1236
01:38:54.158 --> 01:38:56.243
Yuri.

1237
01:38:57.661 --> 01:38:59.913
Welcome back.

1238
01:39:00.873 --> 01:39:04.251
Welcome, both of you.
Welcome to democracy.

1239
01:39:04.418 --> 01:39:07.254
Democracy?
What have you been drinking, Andy?

1240
01:39:07.421 --> 01:39:11.216
You have not seen the news.
They accuse me of rigging elections.

1241
01:39:11.383 --> 01:39:15.804
But after this, with your Florida
and your Supreme Court of kangaroos,

1242
01:39:15.971 --> 01:39:19.183
now... the US must shut up forever.

1243
01:39:19.683 --> 01:39:21.560
(Uaughs)

1244
01:39:23.896 --> 01:39:25.814
How do you do this, Yuri, huh?

1245
01:39:27.107 --> 01:39:31.904
How do you do this when they are
watching all of my airspace?

1246
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:35.157
Where there's a will there's a weapon.

1247
01:39:35.324 --> 01:39:37.117
Come on, where's my fucking money?

1248
01:39:41.914 --> 01:39:44.041
When it is delivered.

1249
01:39:45.417 --> 01:39:48.128
- It is delivered.
- This is not for me.

1250
01:39:48.295 --> 01:39:49.922
This is for my neighbors to the west.

1251
01:39:50.088 --> 01:39:52.090
The west?

1252
01:39:53.425 --> 01:39:56.011
- We're going to Sierra Leone.
- Oh, yes.

1253
01:39:56.178 --> 01:39:58.722
And my son, Baptiste Jr.
Will go with you

1254
01:39:58.889 --> 01:40:01.099
to make the proper introductions.

1255
01:40:01.266 --> 01:40:03.769
We have no trucks.

1256
01:40:03.936 --> 01:40:09.149
You will... as soon
as we get the food out of them.

1257
01:40:13.195 --> 01:40:15.280
The gun of Rambo.

1258
01:40:15.447 --> 01:40:18.659
Mr. Yuri, you are a man
of your word.

1259
01:40:18.825 --> 01:40:22.204
- So where are we going?
- RUF.

1260
01:40:22.371 --> 01:40:25.207
The Freedom Fighters.

1261
01:40:25.374 --> 01:40:28.585
<i>Every faction in Africa calls themselves
by these noble names.</i>

1262
01:40:28.752 --> 01:40:30.629
<i>Liberation-this, Patriotic-that,</i>

1263
01:40:30.796 --> 01:40:32.923
<i>Democratic Republic
of something-or-other.</i>

1264
01:40:33.090 --> 01:40:35.551
Yeah!

1265
01:40:35.717 --> 01:40:36.717
Yeah!

1266
01:40:36.843 --> 01:40:39.471
<i>I guess they can't own up
to what they usually are</i> -

1267
01:40:39.638 --> 01:40:44.351
<i>Federation of Worse Oppressors
Than the Last Bunch of Oppressors.</i>

1268
01:40:49.815 --> 01:40:51.358
<i>Often, the most barbaric atrocities</i>

1269
01:40:51.525 --> 01:40:56.071
<i>occur when both combatants
proclaim themselves freedom fighters.</i>

1270
01:41:01.451 --> 01:41:04.496
Right, I've got 500 units,
brand new

1271
01:41:04.663 --> 01:41:06.582
right out of the box
all as clean as this.

1272
01:41:06.748 --> 01:41:08.542
What have you got?

1273
01:41:25.892 --> 01:41:28.270
God! Oh, Jesus!

1274
01:41:32.524 --> 01:41:33.859
Oh, Jesus!

1275
01:41:37.321 --> 01:41:39.156
Yuri, I need to talk to you.

1276
01:41:39.323 --> 01:41:41.867
- Not now.
- Now!

1277
01:41:43.702 --> 01:41:45.829
Excuse me.

1278
01:41:52.836 --> 01:41:54.755
What?

1279
01:41:54.921 --> 01:41:57.215
- We can't do this deal.
- The fuck we can't.

1280
01:41:57.382 --> 01:42:00.802
- What's the matter with you?
- Look. Look over there.

1281
01:42:00.969 --> 01:42:04.139
As soon as we hand over the guns
those people are going to die.

1282
01:42:05.223 --> 01:42:07.809
It's not our business.

1283
01:42:09.353 --> 01:42:12.898
They killed a boy just now
as young as Nicki.

1284
01:42:15.942 --> 01:42:17.194
What is the holdup?

1285
01:42:17.903 --> 01:42:20.364
There is no holdup.
I'll be right there.

1286
01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:23.450
It's what we always know.
We can't control what they do.

1287
01:42:23.617 --> 01:42:27.954
No no, today we can. Today we can.
Yuri, they're right there!

1288
01:42:28.121 --> 01:42:31.375
What do you think they'll do to us
if we back out? They'll kill us.

1289
01:42:31.541 --> 01:42:33.919
And if we go ahead,
what do you think they'll do to them?

1290
01:42:39.091 --> 01:42:40.425
We got to do something.

1291
01:42:49.393 --> 01:42:52.938
- What is he saying?
- It's the, uh, deal.

1292
01:42:53.105 --> 01:42:56.817
My brother's not happy with the terms,
but we're working it out. It's nothing.

1293
01:43:05.242 --> 01:43:08.161
Right? It's nothing.

1294
01:43:15.127 --> 01:43:17.337
Yeah, nothing.

1295
01:43:18.630 --> 01:43:20.924
You're right, Yuri.
You're right.

1296
01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:24.136
God, I've got to get my shit together.

1297
01:43:24.302 --> 01:43:26.596
Uh, this is not our fight.

1298
01:43:27.097 --> 01:43:28.097
Right.

1299
01:43:28.223 --> 01:43:32.644
OK, what's the deal?
300 RPGs, 500 assault rifles

1300
01:43:32.811 --> 01:43:35.313
and 800 grenades.

1301
01:43:37.441 --> 01:43:40.485
I thought it was 1200 grenades.

1302
01:43:43.029 --> 01:43:44.531
<i>I was so caught up in the deal</i>

1303
01:43:44.698 --> 01:43:47.200
<i>I never realized what
was going on in Vitaly's head.</i>

1304
01:43:47.367 --> 01:43:51.079
I thought it was 1200 grenades.
Confused.

1305
01:43:51.246 --> 01:43:55.917
<i>Maybe I never understood
what was going on in his head.</i>

1306
01:43:59.671 --> 01:44:02.674
I beg your pardon.
May I see another stone?

1307
01:44:02.841 --> 01:44:05.469
<i>One thing I do understand for certain</i>

1308
01:44:05.635 --> 01:44:08.764
<i>is that Vitaly broke
the cardinal rule of gunrunning.</i>

1309
01:44:09.181 --> 01:44:13.018
<i>Never pick up a gun
and join the customers.</i>

1310
01:44:19.441 --> 01:44:21.401
What are you doing?

1311
01:44:24.654 --> 01:44:26.281
Something for Yuri.

1312
01:44:27.491 --> 01:44:29.868
Step away. Slow.

1313
01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:50.597
No, Vit!

1314
01:44:51.807 --> 01:44:54.017
No, Vit!

1315
01:46:19.644 --> 01:46:24.482
<i>Only half the guns were gone, so I was
still entitled to half the diamonds.</i>

1316
01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:26.902
<i>If I took them, I was lost.</i>

1317
01:46:27.068 --> 01:46:29.446
<i>If I left them, I was lost.</i>

1318
01:46:37.704 --> 01:46:40.957
<i>The massacre played out
exactly how Vitaly predicted.</i>

1319
01:46:41.124 --> 01:46:45.420
<i>But then a half dozen other massacres
happened in Sierra Leone that week.</i>

1320
01:46:45.587 --> 01:46:47.088
<i>You can't stop them all.</i>

1321
01:46:47.255 --> 01:46:50.050
<i>In my experience,
you can't stop any of them.</i>

1322
01:46:51.843 --> 01:46:55.513
<i>They say "evil prevails
when good men fail to act."</i>

1323
01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:00.268
<i>What they ought to say
is "evil prevails."</i>

1324
01:47:13.490 --> 01:47:15.325
<i>I now shared even more in common</i>

1325
01:47:15.492 --> 01:47:18.787
<i>with the leader of that country
God seemed to have forsaken.</i>

1326
01:47:18.954 --> 01:47:22.165
<i>We saw something in each other
neither one of us liked.</i>

1327
01:47:22.332 --> 01:47:24.626
<i>Or maybe we were
just looking in the mirror.</i>

1328
01:47:44.646 --> 01:47:49.025
<i>I'd paid a Monrovian doctor $20
to remove the lead from Vitaly's body</i>

1329
01:47:49.192 --> 01:47:52.070
<i>and write a bogus death certificate.</i>

1330
01:47:52.237 --> 01:47:53.530
<i>I should have paid more.</i>

1331
01:47:53.697 --> 01:47:56.157
<i>I've smuggled millions
of rounds of ammunition</i>

1332
01:47:56.324 --> 01:48:01.579
<i>and the bullet that lands me in jail
is found under my dead brother's rib.</i>

1333
01:48:02.414 --> 01:48:04.207
Yuri Orlov.

1334
01:48:04.374 --> 01:48:07.127
We're with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.

1335
01:48:07.293 --> 01:48:10.547
Let me guess. This isn't about
the alcohol or the tobacco.

1336
01:48:52.797 --> 01:48:55.925
- Crimean Restaurant.
- Papa?

1337
01:49:02.724 --> 01:49:04.809
Both my sons are dead.

1338
01:49:08.271 --> 01:49:12.859
<i>There are only two tragedies in life.
One is not getting what you want.</i>

1339
01:49:13.026 --> 01:49:15.737
<i>- The other is getting it.
- This one of yours?</i>

1340
01:49:15.904 --> 01:49:18.782
<i>Jack Valentine finally had
what he wanted.</i>

1341
01:49:18.948 --> 01:49:24.329
Curiously, the death certificate
says he died of heart failure.

1342
01:49:24.496 --> 01:49:28.124
Falsifying a death certificate?
That's not going to hold me.

1343
01:49:28.291 --> 01:49:30.168
You're right.

1344
01:49:30.335 --> 01:49:32.504
As usual, you are right.

1345
01:49:35.173 --> 01:49:37.592
Have you seen today's paper?

1346
01:49:37.759 --> 01:49:39.010
Huh?

1347
01:49:44.891 --> 01:49:46.184
Fake end-user certificates.

1348
01:49:46.351 --> 01:49:49.521
Cut-out companies,
meticulously catalogued.

1349
01:49:49.687 --> 01:49:53.775
There is hardly a warlord, dictator
or despot anywhere in the world

1350
01:49:53.942 --> 01:49:55.819
that you're not
on a first-name basis with.

1351
01:49:56.486 --> 01:49:59.531
It was your wife - your trophy wife -

1352
01:49:59.697 --> 01:50:02.200
that led us to the prize.

1353
01:50:02.367 --> 01:50:05.870
It's not her fault. She's just
easier to follow than you are.

1354
01:50:07.413 --> 01:50:10.792
- May I?
- Yeah, go ahead.

1355
01:50:35.233 --> 01:50:36.609
Enjoy it.

1356
01:50:37.318 --> 01:50:39.320
- What?
- This.

1357
01:50:39.487 --> 01:50:42.240
Tell me I'm everything you despise.

1358
01:50:42.407 --> 01:50:44.659
That I'm the personification of evil.

1359
01:50:44.826 --> 01:50:46.911
That I'm, what, responsible

1360
01:50:47.078 --> 01:50:50.915
for the breakdown of the fabric
of society and world order.

1361
01:50:51.082 --> 01:50:53.585
I'm a one-man genocide.

1362
01:50:53.751 --> 01:50:57.672
Say everything you want to say to me
now. 'Cause you don't have long.

1363
01:50:58.506 --> 01:51:00.925
Are you paying attention'?

1364
01:51:01.092 --> 01:51:03.428
Or are you delusional?

1365
01:51:03.595 --> 01:51:07.015
You have broken
every arms embargo written.

1366
01:51:07.182 --> 01:51:09.559
There is enough evidence
here to put you away

1367
01:51:09.726 --> 01:51:11.436
for consecutive life sentences.

1368
01:51:11.603 --> 01:51:15.356
You are going to spend the next 10
years going from a cell to a courtroom

1369
01:51:15.523 --> 01:51:19.694
before you even start
serving your time.

1370
01:51:21.112 --> 01:51:25.909
I don't think you fully appreciate
the seriousness of your situation.

1371
01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:38.254
My family has disowned me.

1372
01:51:39.797 --> 01:51:42.800
My wife and son have left me.

1373
01:51:45.511 --> 01:51:47.889
My brother's dead.

1374
01:51:48.056 --> 01:51:53.269
Trust me, I fully appreciate
the seriousness of my situation.

1375
01:51:53.436 --> 01:51:55.480
But I promise you,

1376
01:51:55.647 --> 01:51:57.982
I won't spend a single second
in a courtroom.

1377
01:51:58.149 --> 01:52:01.194
You are delusional.

1378
01:52:01.361 --> 01:52:03.905
I like you, Jack.

1379
01:52:04.072 --> 01:52:07.450
Well, maybe not,
but I understand you.

1380
01:52:11.371 --> 01:52:14.499
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

1381
01:52:14.666 --> 01:52:17.210
This way you can prepare yourself.

1382
01:52:21.673 --> 01:52:22.674
OK.

1383
01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:26.052
Soon there'll be a knock on that door
and you will be called outside.

1384
01:52:26.219 --> 01:52:28.680
<i>In the hall there will be a man
who outranks you.</i>

1385
01:52:28.846 --> 01:52:32.016
<i>First, he'll compliment you
on the fine job you've done,</i>

1386
01:52:32.183 --> 01:52:34.352
<i>that you're making the world
a safer place,</i>

1387
01:52:34.519 --> 01:52:38.898
that you're to receive a commendation
and a promotion.

1388
01:52:39.065 --> 01:52:41.693
And then he's going to tell you
that I am to be released.

1389
01:52:41.859 --> 01:52:44.362
<i>You're going to protest.</i>

1390
01:52:44.529 --> 01:52:46.823
<i>You'll probably threaten
to resign.</i>

1391
01:52:46.990 --> 01:52:49.867
But in the end,
I will be released.

1392
01:52:50.034 --> 01:52:55.039
The reason I'll be released is the
same reason you think I'll be convicted.

1393
01:52:55.206 --> 01:52:58.876
I do rub shoulders
with some of the most vile, sadistic men

1394
01:52:59.043 --> 01:53:02.255
calling themselves leaders today.

1395
01:53:02.422 --> 01:53:04.424
But some of those men

1396
01:53:05.591 --> 01:53:08.761
are the enemies of your enemies.

1397
01:53:09.929 --> 01:53:12.974
And while the biggest arms dealer
in the world is your boss,

1398
01:53:13.975 --> 01:53:15.893
the President of the United States,

1399
01:53:16.060 --> 01:53:20.690
who ships more merchandise
in a day than I do in a year...

1400
01:53:20.857 --> 01:53:25.320
sometimes it's embarrassing
to have his fingerprints on the guns.

1401
01:53:25.486 --> 01:53:28.406
Sometimes he needs
a freelancer like me

1402
01:53:28.573 --> 01:53:31.701
to supply forces
he can't be seen supplying.

1403
01:53:31.868 --> 01:53:33.661
So...

1404
01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:37.373
you call me evil.

1405
01:53:38.249 --> 01:53:40.877
But, unfortunately for you,

1406
01:53:41.044 --> 01:53:43.796
I'm a necessary evil.

1407
01:53:59.062 --> 01:54:02.357
I would tell you to go to hell,

1408
01:54:02.523 --> 01:54:04.442
but I think you're already there.

1409
01:54:39.435 --> 01:54:41.437
Pleasure doing business with you.

1410
01:54:41.604 --> 01:54:43.981
<i>Most people are happy
just to get out of jail.</i>

1411
01:54:44.148 --> 01:54:46.651
<i>I expect to be paid to leave.</i>

1412
01:54:46.818 --> 01:54:49.946
<i>I'm not a fool. I know that just because
they needed me that day</i>

1413
01:54:50.113 --> 01:54:52.990
<i>didn't mean they wouldn't make me
a scapegoat the next.</i>

1414
01:54:53.157 --> 01:54:57.286
<i>But I was back
doing what I do best.</i>

1415
01:55:19.517 --> 01:55:21.936
<i>You know who's going
to inherit the Earth?</i>

1416
01:55:22.103 --> 01:55:23.563
<i>Arms dealers.</i>

1417
01:55:23.729 --> 01:55:27.024
Because everyone else
is too busy killing each other.

1418
01:55:27.191 --> 01:55:29.318
That's the secret to survival.

1419
01:55:29.485 --> 01:55:31.988
Never go to war.

1420
01:55:34.449 --> 01:55:37.118
Especially with yourself.
