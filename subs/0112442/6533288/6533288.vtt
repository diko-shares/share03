00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.823
Hey, man, what's this "having
a picnic" shit in my car?

2
00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:01.760
Please, man, I'm not gettin' my sex at home.
Don't deny me this.

3
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.429
What are you talking about?
You sleep with a beautiful woman every night.

4
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.998
I'm married.
That's what "married" means.

5
00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.340
You sleep together
but you can't get none.

6
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.908
Why don't you watch it
with all that shit, all right?

7
00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.545
Hey, look, where's
your cup-holders?

8
00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.613
I don't have one.

9
00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:25.551
What do you mean?
$80,000 for this car and you
ain't got no damn cup-holder?

10
00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:29.755
It's $105,000, this happens
to be one of the fastest
production cars on the planet.

11
00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.557
0 to 60 in
four seconds, sweetie.

12
00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.058
This is a limited edition.

13
00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.660
You damn right it's limited!

14
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.962
No cup-holder, no back seat.

15
00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.465
It's a shiny dick
with two chairs in it.

16
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.466
I guess we the balls,
just dragging the fuck along.

17
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.370
Oh, damn!

18
00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:46.572
Sorry.

19
00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.146
Get it.

20
00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.914
I can't get down there.
Engineering flaw up in here.

21
00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:58.686
My shit ain't going down
up in there.

22
00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:02.454
Go! Titty-titty,
strutty-strutty.

23
00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.655
Go on.
Make them want it.

24
00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:06.892
I ain't your wife to be
cleaning up after your
filthy ass.

25
00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:10.762
You watch my hand, okay?
And when it does, it
gets stuck.

26
00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.998
Now, what do you come
up with? You got this shit.

27
00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.767
You gonna get that fry.

28
00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:17.569
This ain't no goddamn
Denny's. No eating in my...

29
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.407
I wouldn't be buying
Denny's anyway, not like
the way we been treated.

30
00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:24.475
They bit, Jack. Let's
gank these fools!

31
00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:27.713
Damn fry.
You all up in that.

32
00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:28.714
Get out of the car, man.

33
00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:29.715
Shit.

34
00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:30.916
What the fuck?

35
00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.885
We've had
a big week.

36
00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.920
So just get the fuck
out of the car.

37
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.689
Damn! What are you
weighing, 350?

38
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.659
I bet you're a big
Popeye Chicken-eating
motherfucker, ain't you?

39
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.160
Hey, hey.

40
00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.129
Why I always got to get the
big, thick motherfuckers?

41
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.696
Out of the car now!

42
00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:46.937
All right! All right!
All right!

43
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.701
Hold on!

44
00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.604
Now this is some funny shit.
Let me tell you how bad
a day you're having.

45
00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.640
Right now, you're jacking
a couple cops.

46
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.874
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm
a stand-up comedian,

47
00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.445
and I suck!
That's why I need your car.

48
00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.146
Now, I ain't no Wesley Snipes.

49
00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:05.017
I just hang out with
stupid-ass friends that drive
stupid-ass cars

50
00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.653
that attract a lot of
motherfucking attention!

51
00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:11.623
I need to jump over this car
and smack your head.
That's what I need to do.

52
00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:14.125
You know what?
You're arguing over
a motherfucking French fry.

53
00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:16.862
It's not about a fry.
It's about a lack of respect
for other people's property!

54
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:17.996
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

55
00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.098
Shut the fuck up!

56
00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.099
That shit is stupid!
Hold the fuck on!

57
00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.500
Shut up! Shut up!

58
00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:24.702
If you want some bad
enough, come get some!

59
00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:29.575
You like that shit?

60
00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.511
Wesley Snipes, Passenger 57.

61
00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.214
Now give me a
motherfucking Handi Wipe.

62
00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:36.814
Now let's hear one
of those jokes, bitch.

63
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:15.146
What do you think, guys?
Looks like the real thing.

64
00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:16.982
You remember your assignment?

65
00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.152
Yeah, I'm the decoy.

66
00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.856
Yes, you are.

67
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.063
What the fuck
are you doing?

68
00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:34.732
Hello, police?
I just saw something terrible,
a policeman shot

69
00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:38.235
on South Miami and
First Street. Help, please!

70
00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:40.739
Officer down. Officer down.

71
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.046
Respond code 3.

72
00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:49.006
All units in the vicinity,
respond and identify.

73
00:06:07.634 --> 00:06:10.134
This is Air Unit 2.
We've got a full perimeter.

74
00:06:10.135 --> 00:06:13.077
Officer down.
We need additional
ground units.

75
00:06:19.077 --> 00:06:21.719
Air 3, roger.
Suspect or suspects unknown.

76
00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.255
Gentlemen, it's clear.

77
00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.894
We're inside.

78
00:07:08.894 --> 00:07:10.829
We're in.

79
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.173
You got 20 minutes.

80
00:07:21.173 --> 00:07:25.158
Oh... Goddamn taco's
gonna kill me.

81
00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:41.960
Okay, guys, we got
12 minutes. Come on, let's go.

82
00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.906
Clear. We're in.

83
00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:30.010
Move your ass.
We got six minutes.

84
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.010
Ready.

85
00:08:37.883 --> 00:08:39.164
Ready to fire. Go!

86
00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:52.164
Fire!

87
00:08:55.834 --> 00:08:56.834
Go!

88
00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:13.517
Move!

89
00:09:34.339 --> 00:09:36.076
Oh.

90
00:09:38.076 --> 00:09:40.011
Ooh.

91
00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:41.415
Damn!

92
00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.185
Did you have sweet dreams?

93
00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:47.685
You're so nasty.

94
00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:49.187
Mm-hm.

95
00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:52.424
You always saying
you want quality time.

96
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.229
Well, right now I got
the time and you damn
sure got the quality.

97
00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:58.229
Come on now.

98
00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:59.031
Uh-uh.

99
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:01.031
You know what it is?

100
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:06.641
I can't remember
the last time that we
fell asleep together.

101
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:09.878
Baby...

102
00:10:11.878 --> 00:10:15.179
Baby, it's my job.
It's what it requires.

103
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.349
You know I'm a better cop
when I get some in
the morning.

104
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.251
I feel lighter on my feet.

105
00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:21.585
You're going to have
to keep it in your pants,

106
00:10:21.586 --> 00:10:23.188
because I hear three
little Burnetts coming.

107
00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:24.890
That's cold.

108
00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:27.092
You gonna leave me here
like a humping dog.

109
00:10:28.426 --> 00:10:29.597
Hi, baby boy!

110
00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:32.597
Daddy! Daddy!

111
00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:33.637
What's up?

112
00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:44.275
Dad, at school, people say
I look weird.
They say my ears look funny.

113
00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:48.112
Boy, your daddy has that
same problem. I got the ears.
But you know what?

114
00:10:48.113 --> 00:10:50.982
They just out there for you to
listen to people's problems.

115
00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:54.618
You're an angel.
These are your wings.
Flap, flap. That's all.

116
00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:59.958
James, stop!
Would you take them off?

117
00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:02.327
And don't let me have to
come down to that school.
I'll arrest the principal.

118
00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.328
Mom, mom.

119
00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.396
What?

120
00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:05.632
Talking about my boy's ears.

121
00:11:07.632 --> 00:11:09.132
Uncle Mike's in the house!

122
00:11:09.133 --> 00:11:10.669
What's up, Uncle Mike?

123
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.670
Partner, partner!

124
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.137
What's going on?

125
00:11:13.138 --> 00:11:14.372
Quincy, check that out.

126
00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:18.142
What'd you take
my food for?

127
00:11:18.143 --> 00:11:21.148
Don't kiss me, Mike!
I don't know where your lips
were last night. Move.

128
00:11:23.148 --> 00:11:24.828
Uncle Mike, did you
have a date last night?

129
00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:27.519
Ooh, did I!

130
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.987
Let me tell you, boy,
now this girl was...

131
00:11:29.988 --> 00:11:32.958
Hey, don't you go telling
my son none of your sleazy
sex stories.

132
00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:34.726
I only tell your husband
my sleazy sex stories.

133
00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:36.962
Hey.

134
00:11:36.963 --> 00:11:38.496
I don't want him knowing about
them either. It gives
him ideas.

135
00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.030
Why you put me in this?

136
00:11:40.031 --> 00:11:42.067
I'm with my babies.

137
00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:43.068
Okay? Thank you.

138
00:11:43.735 --> 00:11:45.002
Hello.

139
00:11:45.003 --> 00:11:46.371
Eat. Go on, girl.

140
00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:47.372
No problem.

141
00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.074
Man, she was a blu-bla-blam...

142
00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:50.445
Oh.

143
00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:53.745
You're on the mike with Mike.

144
00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:56.280
Want Daddy to wipe your mouth?

145
00:11:56.281 --> 00:12:00.050
I think you mean to say,
"Get our asses down there,
please," Captain.

146
00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.554
Maybe not.

147
00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:15.065
Hey, baby!

148
00:12:15.066 --> 00:12:16.534
Hey, Francine, where's Howard?

149
00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:20.141
Down there. He's looking
for you. He's been in
better moods.

150
00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:24.275
Aw, damn!

151
00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:27.013
Get it done,
goddamn it!

152
00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:30.182
Welcome to our nightmare, boys.

153
00:12:31.182 --> 00:12:33.050
See this?

154
00:12:33.051 --> 00:12:35.122
What's wrong with
this picture, huh?

155
00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:38.055
Remember this room?

156
00:12:38.056 --> 00:12:40.391
These slats, they look
familiar, don't they?

157
00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:43.660
There was these silver packets
they looked like bricks.

158
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:46.296
Little red tags on them,
about so high?

159
00:12:46.297 --> 00:12:48.400
All that heroin, gone.

160
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:51.102
This was our career bust.
This was, what, $100 million?

161
00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:53.103
Gone!

162
00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:53.038
Oh, this is bad.

163
00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:55.707
No, let me call it what it is,
this is fucked up!

164
00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.276
You got that right, detective.

165
00:12:58.276 --> 00:13:00.511
Hello, Alison.

166
00:13:00.512 --> 00:13:03.580
You guys know
Captain Sinclair, Internal
Affairs' top watchdog.

167
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:06.583
You know, I'd actually
take that as a compliment if
I didn't know you so well.

168
00:13:06.584 --> 00:13:10.588
Excuse me, but if you two
want to get personal,
I could step out.

169
00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:13.625
There's nothing personal
going on here.
I'm just doing my job.

170
00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:16.060
I mean, I love knowing that
one leak, one headline

171
00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:19.064
can turn this nightmare
into a media frenzy.

172
00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:22.333
That's not gonna happen.
We're gonna get the dope back
before that ever happens.

173
00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:24.301
Good. Why don't you start
by looking here,

174
00:13:24.302 --> 00:13:26.570
because this had
to have been an inside job.

175
00:13:26.571 --> 00:13:29.107
And I'm gonna find out about it.

176
00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.646
Sanchez, Ruiz,
you guys are late.

177
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:37.217
So they put this in for
toxic drug fumes?

178
00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:42.252
Yeah, this was a brilliant
design. This was really
intelligent. I like this.

179
00:13:42.253 --> 00:13:44.722
I didn't ask how he feels.
I said, what did he see?

180
00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:45.723
What does he know?

181
00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:50.160
Where were y'all
last night, man?

182
00:13:50.161 --> 00:13:51.596
Why don't y'all just have
your cousins bring

183
00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:53.865
the shit back and we can
all get some sleep.

184
00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:56.177
We were gonna do that,
but you know what happened?
We came up with a problem.

185
00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:58.803
Your mama snorted
up all the dope.

186
00:13:58.804 --> 00:14:00.164
All right, you two,
get over there.

187
00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:05.676
O'Fee's gonna be all right,
but he's got nothing
to tell us.

188
00:14:05.677 --> 00:14:09.646
So they kill a decoy,
it empties the station.
Very smart.

189
00:14:09.647 --> 00:14:10.881
But they don't kill a real cop,

190
00:14:10.882 --> 00:14:13.184
'cause they know they'd have
the whole force on their ass.

191
00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.819
This was your case.
You're back on it.

192
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.589
Sanchez, Ruiz, you back them
up with whatever they need.

193
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.525
With whatever they need.
Shut your mouths.

194
00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.293
All right,
but now wait a second.

195
00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:24.496
It was Carrera's drugs
in the first place, right?

196
00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:26.430
But it couldn't have
been him, because he was
killed in prison.

197
00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:27.699
What about the rest of his crew?

198
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.401
The rest of those idiots don't
have the precision to do this.

199
00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:33.471
But just in case I'm wrong,
you guys check them out.

200
00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:37.308
Yeah, they'd have been up
in here with Uzis, splashing
O'Fee all over the place.

201
00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:39.276
It takes brains to
pull something like this.

202
00:14:39.277 --> 00:14:41.378
Big cojones too.

203
00:14:41.379 --> 00:14:43.580
What the hell are you
talking about, cojones?

204
00:14:43.581 --> 00:14:46.184
It would take me
a month to explain to you
what cojones are.

205
00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:49.185
You're in Miami,
don't know cojones?

206
00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:48.252
English.

207
00:14:48.253 --> 00:14:50.554
Ho! Ho! Hey!

208
00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:54.324
We got nothing.
What's the matter with you?
We've got nothing.

209
00:14:54.325 --> 00:14:57.362
The guy who pulled this off
knew what he was doing.

210
00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.697
And he left us nothing
but a big "fuck you."

211
00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:01.565
Ruiz, Sanchez,

212
00:15:01.566 --> 00:15:04.506
find out who installed
the ventilating system, okay?
Do that now.

213
00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:09.506
Oh, that's cold.

214
00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:09.574
So's your mama's bed.

215
00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:13.911
This could definitely be an
inside job. Don't rule it out.

216
00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:17.415
The way I see it,
we got 72 hours
before the FBI and the DEA

217
00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.250
walk in here and shut us down.

218
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.553
And we're gonna be the bad guys.

219
00:15:21.554 --> 00:15:26.190
The politics demand that
somebody take the rap for
this, and it's gonna be us.

220
00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:29.660
Just do what you do.
Only faster.

221
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:32.597
Jojo. What's up?
You still a chemist, right?

222
00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.299
Cutting drugs and
shit like that, huh?

223
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.700
I don't know nothing
about that, man.

224
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:38.402
I'm out of the drug business.

225
00:15:38.403 --> 00:15:40.271
You know something.

226
00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:42.806
I just said "no" to drugs.

227
00:15:42.807 --> 00:15:45.676
You said "no" to drugs.
What you into, Jo?

228
00:15:45.677 --> 00:15:48.677
Rubber, rubber, rubber.
Check it out.

229
00:15:45.677 --> 00:15:48.346
You're selling tires, huh?

230
00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:50.314
Yeah.

231
00:15:50.315 --> 00:15:52.550
So you don't know nothing?
Jojo don't know nothing.

232
00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.685
I know tires.

233
00:15:54.686 --> 00:15:56.186
You telling me the truth, right?

234
00:15:56.187 --> 00:15:57.487
Would I lie to you?

235
00:15:57.488 --> 00:15:58.488
Would you lie to me?

236
00:15:58.489 --> 00:15:59.931
Hey! You driving.

237
00:16:06.931 --> 00:16:08.900
Yo, man,
this is a waste of time.

238
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:11.301
Oh, come on, man.

239
00:16:11.302 --> 00:16:14.405
I keep telling you,
in Maxie's line of work,
she definitely gets the 411.

240
00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:17.446
Maxie! How'd I know
I was gonna find
you up in here?

241
00:16:21.446 --> 00:16:24.248
Listen, Max, we got to talk.
Is there some place we can go?

242
00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.983
Yeah, the equipment room.

243
00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:27.984
Behave yourself.

244
00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:27.893
Oh, I'm cool.

245
00:16:35.893 --> 00:16:36.893
Ooh...

246
00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:42.467
Listen, I need some help.
Again.

247
00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:43.840
So, what else is new?

248
00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.945
Oh, sh...

249
00:16:53.945 --> 00:16:55.747
Oh, sh...

250
00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:59.684
Some major, major ill shit
happened down at the P.D.

251
00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:02.687
There's a lot of heroin
involved, there's gonna
be a lot of cash involved.

252
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.555
There's definitely gonna be
some jolly young men running
around who want to party.

253
00:17:05.556 --> 00:17:07.358
What do you need?

254
00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.660
There's a lot of people who will

255
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:10.428
talk to you that
won't talk to me.

256
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:13.363
You mean customers?

257
00:17:13.364 --> 00:17:18.503
Listen, I'm not asking you to
get into any wild shit. Just
call me if you hear something.

258
00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:19.504
I think I will call you.

259
00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:20.847
Mm.

260
00:17:29.847 --> 00:17:31.649
What the hell are you doing?

261
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.017
Trying to keep my shit quick.

262
00:17:34.018 --> 00:17:36.621
Oh, that's right, ain't
getting none at home.
You got a little extra energy.

263
00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:38.092
Go ahead, burn it off.

264
00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:42.326
Hey, we got anything, Francine?

265
00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:44.862
Sanchez says that
the air conditioning contract
went to

266
00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:48.432
Manuel Arrona of Key Biscayne.

267
00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:50.753
He's working out of his house
this week. That's the number.

268
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.545
He's not answering.

269
00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:02.913
I guess we should just leave.

270
00:18:02.914 --> 00:18:06.918
What, make a trip
all the way down here to
high society for nothing?

271
00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.120
No, man. That's what
they got windows for.
We can peek in.

272
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.094
Oh, yeah, that should be okay.

273
00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:19.094
I tripped.

274
00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:18.462
The handle just opened for you?

275
00:18:18.463 --> 00:18:20.364
Right after I tripped,
it just opened.

276
00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:22.033
I guess they want us to come in.

277
00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:23.737
Take a peek.

278
00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:26.903
Hello!

279
00:18:26.904 --> 00:18:30.041
We're your new neighbors.

280
00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:32.075
Don't be alarmed.
We're Negroes.

281
00:18:32.076 --> 00:18:34.978
No, man! No. That's too
much bass in your voice.

282
00:18:34.979 --> 00:18:38.149
That scare white folks.
You got to sound like them.

283
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.830
We were wondering if we can
borrow some brown sugar.

284
00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:49.226
You fart?

285
00:18:49.227 --> 00:18:50.498
No, man.

286
00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:53.540
Dead guy.

287
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.977
Ugh.

288
00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.979
Well, looks like
somebody's home.

289
00:19:16.654 --> 00:19:19.657
Okay, let me take
a stab at this one.

290
00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:22.459
He sells the ventilation
plans to the bad guys.

291
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.960
He gets rich, but he gets dead.

292
00:19:23.961 --> 00:19:25.897
You're right on that one.

293
00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:27.664
I'm going to go call Homicide.

294
00:19:27.665 --> 00:19:28.900
Whoa, whoa, wait.

295
00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:31.002
Why do you act like this every
time we around a dead body?

296
00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:33.072
It's cool. I just...

297
00:19:34.072 --> 00:19:35.543
Please? Look around.

298
00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:41.082
The smell and the...
It's just unexpected,
that's all.

299
00:19:51.523 --> 00:19:54.091
It looks like our buddy
Arrona was a bit of a gambler.

300
00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:56.193
Got dog track, jai alai...

301
00:19:56.194 --> 00:19:58.034
Probably needed the
money to pay off his debts.

302
00:19:58.497 --> 00:19:59.999
Bookie.

303
00:20:01.999 --> 00:20:03.234
Oops.

304
00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:05.035
Damn, man!

305
00:20:05.036 --> 00:20:06.903
Watch where you
swinging the dead leg.

306
00:20:06.904 --> 00:20:08.238
My bad, my bad.

307
00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:10.975
Damn this.
I'm calling Homicide.

308
00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:13.113
I'm a narcotics cop.

309
00:20:16.113 --> 00:20:18.117
Dead bodies...

310
00:20:20.117 --> 00:20:21.117
Dead ends.

311
00:20:27.625 --> 00:20:29.065
Maggots.

312
00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.145
What's wrong with you, man?

313
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:50.841
Hey, what do you say we
grab a couple of burritos?

314
00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:56.853
You know, you drive
almost slow enough
to drive Miss Daisy.

315
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.227
Hey, man,
the transaction is done.

316
00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:04.728
We ain't got shit, so it's over.

317
00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:07.597
Relax, man. We got it
before, we'll get it again.

318
00:21:07.598 --> 00:21:10.000
Yeah, yeah. You got it all
figured out, don't you?

319
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:12.303
Oh, you got to
have faith, player.

320
00:21:12.304 --> 00:21:15.640
Let me tell you something, all
right? By the time we figured
out how, we'd be out of a job.

321
00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:19.810
No, scratch that.
Everybody in the damn
unit will be out of a job!

322
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:22.079
Oh, but don't worry!

323
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.082
They tend to think
Mike Lowrey going
to be all right.

324
00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:29.887
Especially since they think
you some rich kid playing cop.

325
00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:32.789
Look, man, I ain't
got no trust fund.

326
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.294
Okay, see, for me,
no job, no check.

327
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.829
That's like all
the other guys in the unit.

328
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.564
At least, most of us.

329
00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:43.935
So I'm playing cop now?

330
00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:46.103
This is a game?
I'm just joking around, huh?

331
00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:49.043
You always wanted to be
Starsky or Hutch.

332
00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:52.743
You know what, man?

333
00:21:52.744 --> 00:21:55.645
I'm so sick of this bullshit.

334
00:21:55.646 --> 00:21:57.113
What, I'm supposed to apologize

335
00:21:57.114 --> 00:21:59.150
for my family leaving me money?

336
00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.885
All I ever wanted
to be was a cop.

337
00:22:01.886 --> 00:22:04.654
I get up early
and I take it to the max
every day.

338
00:22:04.655 --> 00:22:05.823
I'm the first guy
through the door

339
00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:07.958
and I'm always the last guy
to leave the crime scene.

340
00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:10.628
So you know what?
Fuck you, and fuck them!

341
00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:12.669
And fuck anybody who got
a problem with Mike Lowrey!

342
00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:16.667
I love you, man.

343
00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:17.805
Fuck you, Marcus.

344
00:22:20.805 --> 00:22:22.372
I do.

345
00:22:22.373 --> 00:22:24.275
You're cool, man.

346
00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:25.276
You're my partner.

347
00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:26.643
Shut up. Shut up, man.

348
00:22:26.644 --> 00:22:28.312
Slow-ass driver.

349
00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:29.313
You driving like a bitch.

350
00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:31.114
Why I got to be all that?

351
00:22:31.115 --> 00:22:33.150
Slow-ass.

352
00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:36.019
I'll take me and you off this
fucking cliff, if you
keep fucking with me.

353
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.654
All right?
Then it would be, what,

354
00:22:37.655 --> 00:22:39.657
two bitches in the sea?
Is that it?

355
00:22:39.658 --> 00:22:40.658
Is that what you want?

356
00:22:40.659 --> 00:22:42.093
Shut up, Marcus.

357
00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:43.764
My wife know I ain't no bitch.

358
00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:47.731
I'm a bad boy.

359
00:22:47.732 --> 00:22:51.635
Bad boys, bad boys.
What you gonna do?

360
00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:54.705
What you gonna do
when they come for you?

361
00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:56.806
Shelly, only models
and that's all.

362
00:22:56.807 --> 00:22:58.813
Max just dropped by.
I got to go. Bye.

363
00:23:01.813 --> 00:23:05.416
What's this that you want
me to call around looking
for the newly rich?

364
00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:09.719
Are there any new guys
partying a lot, spending
a lot of money?

365
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.122
Actually, this guy called me
this morning, desperate,

366
00:23:12.123 --> 00:23:15.325
every two hours, looking for
new girls in town. Are you
available this afternoon?

367
00:23:15.326 --> 00:23:16.326
It'll be a quick $2000.

368
00:23:17.228 --> 00:23:18.829
I've got plans with Julie.

369
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.830
She's your roommate, right?

370
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.032
Yeah.

371
00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:23.234
So bring her. She's cute,
she's sexy, go on.

372
00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:25.268
She's not a working girl, Lois.

373
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:27.037
Doesn't matter.
This guy's on speedballs.

374
00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:29.439
He's probably so messed up
he can't even get it up.

375
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.776
Well, all right, maybe
we'll go check it out.

376
00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:35.045
Could be the party
I'm looking for.

377
00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:37.881
A party
at the Biltmore?
Yeah, that'll really rock.

378
00:23:37.882 --> 00:23:40.250
Okay, Julie,
I owe you one.

379
00:23:40.251 --> 00:23:44.154
Forget about it. I'll just
deduct it from the hundreds
of favors I already owe you.

380
00:23:44.155 --> 00:23:46.390
Am I turning into the guest
that won't leave?

381
00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:48.993
No, I like having
you live with me.

382
00:23:48.994 --> 00:23:52.028
I'm an out-of-work
photographer who doesn't know
how to cook.

383
00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:54.931
I mean, not a big
upside for you there.

384
00:23:54.932 --> 00:23:58.902
So, what incredibly hip
individual inspired this
little visit to the Biltmore?

385
00:23:58.903 --> 00:24:01.337
It's a favor for Mike Lowrey.

386
00:24:01.338 --> 00:24:04.374
Oh, right. The cop who
I think you're just maybe
a little bit in love with.

387
00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:08.112
Well, maybe I am.
But we're just friends, and...

388
00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:11.481
And if I were ever in trouble,
he's the only person I'd call.

389
00:24:11.482 --> 00:24:14.384
I know, I know. I think
I've heard this before.

390
00:24:15.786 --> 00:24:17.286
Hello.

391
00:24:17.287 --> 00:24:18.756
Hi.

392
00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:21.025
You must be Max.
Welcome.

393
00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:22.927
I'm Eddie.

394
00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:25.295
To the Al Capone suite.

395
00:24:25.296 --> 00:24:27.799
So I guess we're a little early.

396
00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:31.067
This is my friend Julie.

397
00:24:31.068 --> 00:24:32.169
Julie.

398
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.470
Hi.

399
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:34.671
You like Al Capone, don't you?

400
00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:38.010
I hadn't really thought
about it much.

401
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.779
I'm not kidding about
this being Capone's.

402
00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:47.250
He had the place rigged
with secret passageways.

403
00:24:47.251 --> 00:24:49.251
Ten minutes, we're out of here.

404
00:24:47.251 --> 00:24:49.452
Five.

405
00:24:49.453 --> 00:24:50.854
Julie. One drink.

406
00:24:50.855 --> 00:24:51.855
What's
the whispering about?

407
00:24:51.856 --> 00:24:52.856
One sip.

408
00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:56.093
Just girl chat.

409
00:24:56.094 --> 00:24:57.462
Where's the bathroom?

410
00:24:58.462 --> 00:25:00.298
Upstairs on your right.

411
00:25:01.298 --> 00:25:02.870
Watch your step.

412
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:05.870
Come.

413
00:25:06.537 --> 00:25:08.537
Sit.

414
00:25:06.537 --> 00:25:08.339
Okay.

415
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.940
Enjoy yourself. Relax.

416
00:25:10.941 --> 00:25:14.245
Eddie's got some
favors to play with.

417
00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:16.147
Yes, that he does.

418
00:25:16.148 --> 00:25:19.048
I should've told you sooner
about Eddie's private party.

419
00:25:19.049 --> 00:25:21.227
Well, now it's a surprise party.

420
00:25:29.227 --> 00:25:32.536
Okay, Max, I think
we've been here about
five minutes too long.

421
00:25:38.536 --> 00:25:41.207
I see you treat
yourself well, Eddie.

422
00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:43.577
Yeah.

423
00:25:46.577 --> 00:25:49.880
I needed to blow off
a little steam after the,
uh...

424
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:52.283
The move, you know.
So I...

425
00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:55.853
A little party with a
couple friends, you know
how it is, that's all.

426
00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:58.189
I was going to invite you guys.

427
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.523
Invite?

428
00:25:59.524 --> 00:26:01.228
Looks like I'm catering this.

429
00:26:04.228 --> 00:26:07.363
I was looking for
my 2 keys of dope,
and now I know where they are.

430
00:26:07.364 --> 00:26:09.504
Yours? Man, it's our score.

431
00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:13.504
And the girl?

432
00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:15.038
Nobody.

433
00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:16.574
Just entertainment.

434
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:18.075
Hi. I'm Max.

435
00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:20.180
Nice to meet you, Max.

436
00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:26.018
I like a woman who
takes pride in her appearance.

437
00:26:28.018 --> 00:26:30.955
Don't you?

438
00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:35.058
Yeah, I hate when a
bitch lets herself slide.

439
00:26:35.059 --> 00:26:38.537
You look like a model in that
dress.
Will you model for me, Max?

440
00:26:46.537 --> 00:26:48.455
Oh, great.
It's the goon squad.

441
00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:19.570
You were a cop
for so long, you should know
hookers talk.

442
00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:22.605
You couldn't wait four more
days until I made the deal?

443
00:27:22.606 --> 00:27:24.608
I can't work with
that kind of stupidity!

444
00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:26.310
Stupidity?

445
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:28.914
I got you connected inside.

446
00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:32.382
I brought you my family.

447
00:27:32.383 --> 00:27:33.420
Eddie.

448
00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.420
It's my family now.

449
00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:41.158
Fouchet,
we're still friends.

450
00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:44.159
What are you guys doing?

451
00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:43.465
You pissed him off.

452
00:27:47.465 --> 00:27:49.400
Use a smaller gun.
You got blood on me again.

453
00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:51.338
Hey. Somebody's
up there! Upstairs!

454
00:27:54.338 --> 00:27:55.946
Get her! Move, Fergie.

455
00:28:00.946 --> 00:28:03.046
Get her!

456
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.010
What the fuck?

457
00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.028
Shoot her!

458
00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:53.363
I got her.
I got her!

459
00:28:54.231 --> 00:28:56.501
Bullshit, I got her.
What do you know
about shooting?

460
00:28:57.501 --> 00:28:59.503
I can't believe she made it!

461
00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:01.504
Jesus!

462
00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:01.471
Are you serious?

463
00:29:01.472 --> 00:29:03.472
She jumped.

464
00:29:03.473 --> 00:29:05.342
Fuck!

465
00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:09.017
Find out who she worked for,
and find out where she lives.

466
00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.558
It's about fucking time!
Lowrey. Burnett.

467
00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:26.295
Come here. Come here.
Look at this. See this guy?

468
00:29:26.296 --> 00:29:27.730
He's dead, right?

469
00:29:27.731 --> 00:29:30.401
Look familiar?
Eddie Dominguez.

470
00:29:30.402 --> 00:29:32.568
The ex-cop.
Two points for you.

471
00:29:32.569 --> 00:29:35.104
And there's some of our
high-grade heroin over there.

472
00:29:35.105 --> 00:29:37.740
There's a headline
Sinclair's gonna love.

473
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:39.581
Look, there's no
signs of forced entry.

474
00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.579
What the fuck is all this?
Look like Beirut.

475
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.680
It's the Al Capone suite.

476
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:47.284
What can I say?
Shit happens.

477
00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:49.152
It's a shitty day.

478
00:29:49.153 --> 00:29:50.754
Real shitty day.

479
00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:54.057
Looks like we got
over here, gentlemen.

480
00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:55.898
Seems to me, somebody's
missing from the party.

481
00:29:56.227 --> 00:29:58.661
All right, listen to me.

482
00:29:58.662 --> 00:30:01.765
Your only function in life
right now is to find that
person. You find her.

483
00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:04.168
It's the only good lead
we got all day. You find her.

484
00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:06.582
Look, man.
I'm gonna check all
calls to the room.

485
00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:19.628
Hey, what you got
over there, partner?

486
00:30:30.628 --> 00:30:31.628
Cover her.

487
00:30:35.566 --> 00:30:37.347
He knew the girl, huh?

488
00:30:50.347 --> 00:30:52.449
Look, man.

489
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.818
All right,
we'll get the witness and
the fools who did this.

490
00:30:55.819 --> 00:30:57.520
Yeah.
Listen, why don't you see if

491
00:30:57.521 --> 00:30:58.589
you can catch
a ride with Howard?

492
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.358
Whoa.
Where you going?

493
00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:03.560
Eight calls were made
to Lois Fields, that's who
Max used to work for.

494
00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:05.295
So I'm gonna check it out.

495
00:31:05.296 --> 00:31:06.362
All right,
well, I'll come with you.

496
00:31:06.363 --> 00:31:07.803
No, why don't
we just catch up later.

497
00:31:08.632 --> 00:31:10.135
You okay?

498
00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:12.135
I'm cool.

499
00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:24.919
Hello? Hello? Hello?

500
00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:28.919
Shit!

501
00:31:34.258 --> 00:31:38.661
Yeah, baby. Look, baby,
I know quality
time was my idea.

502
00:31:38.662 --> 00:31:40.363
Don't talk to me
about quality time.

503
00:31:40.364 --> 00:31:41.664
Hold on, babe.

504
00:31:41.665 --> 00:31:45.235
Look here, I need a full
file on Eddie Dominguez.

505
00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:46.236
That will take
a minute.

506
00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:46.803
Hold on.

507
00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:48.804
I got on the red one.

508
00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:48.438
Baby?

509
00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:52.743
You have on the red one?
The one with the snaps?
Why couldn't you wait till...

510
00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:53.744
You're never home, baby.

511
00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:54.945
Theresa, hold on.

512
00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:57.247
All his files are blocked.

513
00:31:57.248 --> 00:32:00.950
Hey, I don't give a damn
about his personal files.
The man's dead. Unblock it.

514
00:32:00.951 --> 00:32:02.318
Screw you, that's illegal.

515
00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:03.757
No, screw you!

516
00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:07.557
Marcus, are you talking to me?

517
00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:09.759
No, I'm not talking to no...

518
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.962
It's a term you use, baby.
"Screw you" is a cop term.

519
00:32:12.963 --> 00:32:14.963
You ain't screwing nothing!

520
00:32:12.963 --> 00:32:14.698
Theres...

521
00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:16.970
Goddamn it!

522
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.971
Where's Lowrey?

523
00:32:21.972 --> 00:32:23.873
I just paged him.

524
00:32:23.874 --> 00:32:26.410
He's following up
this Lois Fields lead.

525
00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:27.994
The madam?

526
00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:46.462
21-2, request backup.
614 Reach Road.

527
00:32:46.463 --> 00:32:48.455
21-2, backup. Reach Road.

528
00:33:21.665 --> 00:33:22.665
That might be him.

529
00:33:25.335 --> 00:33:27.536
Yeah, Lowrey's desk.

530
00:33:27.537 --> 00:33:30.740
I need to talk
to Detective Mike Lowrey.

531
00:33:30.741 --> 00:33:32.375
- This is Captain Howard.
- Can I help you?

532
00:33:32.376 --> 00:33:35.312
You can get me Detective Lowrey.

533
00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:37.447
Look, this is not another
paternity case is it?

534
00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:40.484
No, it's another murder case,
you twerp!

535
00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:43.019
You're talking about the
murder case at the Biltmore
Hotel tonight?

536
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:47.958
Listen, I've just seen my
best friend get murdered.

537
00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:50.627
And I'll only
talk to Mike Lowrey.

538
00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:53.063
Why only Mike Lowrey?
I have a detective here...

539
00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:57.366
None of your fucking business,
all right? Either Lowrey
or I'm gonna blow town.

540
00:33:57.367 --> 00:33:59.969
Mike, phone! Telephone!
Mike!

541
00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:03.774
He's coming right now.
Hold on, please.

542
00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:05.775
Talk to her.

543
00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:05.842
I ain't got time
for these games.

544
00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:08.778
Talk to her.
This is the witness,
the girl at the hotel.

545
00:34:08.779 --> 00:34:11.782
Yeah, he just got out
of the john. Hold on.
Talk to her now.

546
00:34:11.783 --> 00:34:13.316
Talk to her now or
she's gonna walk.

547
00:34:13.317 --> 00:34:14.885
Captain, I can't be
no Mike, man.

548
00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:16.820
Just talk to her.
She's going to walk out.

549
00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:19.027
This is our witness.
Calm down!

550
00:34:24.027 --> 00:34:25.027
Hello.

551
00:34:25.962 --> 00:34:28.597
This is Mike Lowrey.

552
00:34:28.598 --> 00:34:30.934
He doesn't talk that way.
Talk like him.

553
00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:33.103
Try to talk sexy.
You don't sound
sexy enough.

554
00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:35.104
Captain!

555
00:34:35.105 --> 00:34:36.105
Damn!

556
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:42.378
You don't know me.
My name's Julie Mott.

557
00:34:42.379 --> 00:34:44.814
And I was Max Logan's
best friend.

558
00:34:44.815 --> 00:34:46.650
Okay, whoa, calm
down, calm down.

559
00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:47.953
Talk to me now.

560
00:34:49.953 --> 00:34:51.822
Yeah.

561
00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:55.092
And she said if she
ever needed anything...

562
00:34:57.661 --> 00:34:59.396
I need your help.

563
00:34:59.397 --> 00:35:00.831
Give me the address.

564
00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:03.032
All right. Okay.

565
00:35:03.033 --> 00:35:05.468
It's gonna be all right.
Hey, Mike's to the rescue.

566
00:35:05.469 --> 00:35:07.537
I'm on the way.
All right.

567
00:35:07.538 --> 00:35:09.538
Let me see if I can find Lowrey.

568
00:35:07.538 --> 00:35:09.438
Hey, I can't go.

569
00:35:09.439 --> 00:35:10.706
But you gotta go! Go.

570
00:35:10.707 --> 00:35:13.142
Get Mike down here, man.
Handle this.

571
00:35:13.143 --> 00:35:14.643
Go now. Get out of the chair!

572
00:35:14.644 --> 00:35:16.079
I'll wait till Mike get here.

573
00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.361
You won't see your wife for
a month! Get out of the chair!

574
00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:32.772
Get this fucking door fixed!

575
00:35:40.772 --> 00:35:42.938
Mike Lowrey.

576
00:35:42.939 --> 00:35:45.941
No, easy.
Mike Lowrey.

577
00:35:47.944 --> 00:35:48.944
Shit!

578
00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:51.549
Who's there?

579
00:35:52.549 --> 00:35:54.918
Mike Lowrey.

580
00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:56.987
How do I know it's Mike Lowrey?

581
00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:59.622
Because, I'm Mike Lowrey!

582
00:35:59.623 --> 00:36:01.490
Okay, now we ain't
got much time.

583
00:36:01.491 --> 00:36:04.093
Hold your badge up
to the peephole.

584
00:36:04.094 --> 00:36:06.600
I'm not letting you in
until you do.

585
00:36:14.504 --> 00:36:15.509
No way!

586
00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:20.910
What the fuck was that for?
You're not Mike Lowrey!

587
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:23.680
What you mean I ain't
Mike Lowrey? You've
never even met him... Me!

588
00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:25.681
Max described you differently!

589
00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:25.618
I'm undercover!

590
00:36:27.618 --> 00:36:29.019
Prove it!

591
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.887
Okay.
I know Max from way back.

592
00:36:30.888 --> 00:36:32.655
I helped her
brother get out of jail.

593
00:36:32.656 --> 00:36:34.523
Yeah, so?

594
00:36:34.524 --> 00:36:38.461
I mean, you know,
I was cool like that,
little bump and grind...

595
00:36:38.462 --> 00:36:39.964
Wrong!

596
00:36:40.964 --> 00:36:43.532
Give me the bat!

597
00:36:43.533 --> 00:36:46.168
You wanna go at this? Fine!
You don't want to believe me?

598
00:36:46.169 --> 00:36:47.707
You go at this shit alone!

599
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.541
Oh, I forgot.

600
00:36:52.542 --> 00:36:54.778
The bad guys probably
know where you live,

601
00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:57.017
which means they're coming
for your ass. Good luck!

602
00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:02.120
I saw the whole thing.

603
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.893
I watched them shoot her
like she was nothing.

604
00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:10.765
Please, shut the door.

605
00:37:15.765 --> 00:37:18.168
Look, lady.

606
00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:20.903
You ain't got
no more bats, golf clubs,

607
00:37:20.904 --> 00:37:23.176
or anything like that you
can swing at me, do you?

608
00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:27.510
I knew Max, okay?

609
00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:29.882
I cared about Max also.

610
00:37:31.882 --> 00:37:32.922
I'm just here to help you.

611
00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:39.956
You're not what I expected.

612
00:37:39.957 --> 00:37:42.726
Yeah, well,
I ain't expect to walk
into Yankee Stadium either.

613
00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.231
Okay, now, we got to get out
of here, okay? Let's go.

614
00:37:49.232 --> 00:37:50.872
I've got to get my dogs.
Come here, Dukie!

615
00:37:52.736 --> 00:37:54.804
Lukie, Dukie, whatever!

616
00:37:54.805 --> 00:37:57.006
Look, you got a back door?

617
00:37:57.007 --> 00:37:59.007
Where we going?
Duke, come here.

618
00:37:59.008 --> 00:38:00.242
Protective custody.

619
00:38:00.243 --> 00:38:03.246
Well, fuck that!
I'm only dealing with you.

620
00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:06.249
That was a cop
back at the Biltmore.

621
00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:09.052
Former cop, okay?
We got rid of him
a long time ago.

622
00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:11.588
Luke, come on, Luke!

623
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:14.709
Listen, lady, if you want
to live, you ain't got no
choice, you got to trust me.

624
00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:34.257
Run! Run! Move!

625
00:38:47.257 --> 00:38:49.257
Get my dog! Get my dog!

626
00:38:47.257 --> 00:38:50.092
Here, doggie! Come on, doggie!

627
00:38:50.093 --> 00:38:51.927
Jesus Christ!

628
00:38:51.928 --> 00:38:52.928
Who the hell was that?

629
00:38:54.364 --> 00:38:56.967
There is too much
killing going on!

630
00:38:56.968 --> 00:38:58.702
Go after them!
Go! Go!

631
00:38:58.703 --> 00:38:59.703
I'll go around front!

632
00:39:02.272 --> 00:39:06.180
Come on. Come on,
move your ass! Let's go!

633
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.180
Fuck!

634
00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:22.759
Get in the car!

635
00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:25.332
Damn it!

636
00:39:29.332 --> 00:39:30.832
Go, goddamn it!

637
00:39:30.833 --> 00:39:32.802
Fucking door!

638
00:39:32.803 --> 00:39:34.843
Go, goddamn it, go!

639
00:39:41.712 --> 00:39:44.216
How did you miss them?
Huh? You fat fuck!

640
00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:46.983
Watch your fucking
mouth, will you!

641
00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:49.184
Lose some weight and
you would have caught them.

642
00:39:49.185 --> 00:39:51.720
I'd like to come over and
squeeze your little fucking
head, you bastard.

643
00:39:51.721 --> 00:39:53.822
You're in trouble.
Now you're in fucking trouble!

644
00:39:53.823 --> 00:39:55.823
You get the license plate?

645
00:39:53.823 --> 00:39:56.059
Yeah, I got the fucking plates.

646
00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.995
You cockeyed fuck!

647
00:39:58.995 --> 00:40:01.997
This is your
goddamn getaway car?

648
00:40:01.998 --> 00:40:04.401
What is this? A goddamn
family station wagon?

649
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:07.871
Oh, my God, you got...
You got a baby
seat in the back.

650
00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:11.041
It's an undercover car, okay?
Undercover.

651
00:40:11.042 --> 00:40:15.177
Shit. I know they got a look
at my license plate. Were
those the guys who shot Max?

652
00:40:15.178 --> 00:40:17.313
What guys?
All I saw were bullets.

653
00:40:17.314 --> 00:40:18.715
You tell me what
they looked like.

654
00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:22.184
I don't know. I was too
busy trying to keep a
bullet out of your ass.

655
00:40:22.185 --> 00:40:24.585
Look, Julie.
I'm gonna need you
to look through some mug shots

656
00:40:25.221 --> 00:40:27.289
until you can identify
Max's shooter.

657
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:29.425
Where are we gonna do that?
Protective custody.

658
00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:32.327
No way! I told you, I am not
going into protective custody!

659
00:40:32.328 --> 00:40:33.930
Look, lady, I'm not playing.

660
00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:35.699
Okay, you really pissing me off.

661
00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.867
Now, I'll book your narrow ass!

662
00:40:37.868 --> 00:40:42.438
Oh, yeah? And I'll develop
amnesia. I feel a little case
of it coming on right now.

663
00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:45.374
Fine, lady, where
would you feel safe?

664
00:40:45.375 --> 00:40:47.943
You want to do
protective custody?
All right.

665
00:40:47.944 --> 00:40:50.280
We'll do in-home protective
custody at your place.

666
00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.715
All right? I can handle
going to your place.

667
00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:55.050
Yeah, my place.
My place is...

668
00:40:55.051 --> 00:40:56.189
No way.

669
00:40:58.189 --> 00:41:00.423
Right.

670
00:41:00.424 --> 00:41:03.126
My place... Yeah.
No, my place...
Yeah, my place is the shit.

671
00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:06.262
Mike Lowrey's place.
You right.

672
00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:08.663
That's the best idea
you came up with tonight.
Yeah, my place.

673
00:41:12.502 --> 00:41:13.903
Wait here.

674
00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:15.212
Wait here.

675
00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:23.313
Detective Burnett!

676
00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.914
How are you? Long time
no see. Mr. Lowrey, he's
not here. He's out.

677
00:41:26.216 --> 00:41:28.084
I know. He said I could
use his place tonight.

678
00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.605
Oh, really?
He didn't mention it to me.

679
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.925
Who's the chick?
How's your wife?

680
00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:40.329
Fine, she's fine.

681
00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.999
And your kids, they're
good? Because family's
the most important thing.

682
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Is it?

683
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.467
Yeah.

684
00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:46.068
Mr. Lowrey told me that
you got a real baby factory

685
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:47.789
going on over
there at your house.
That true?

686
00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:49.605
Here you go.

687
00:41:49.606 --> 00:41:51.141
Aah.

688
00:41:51.142 --> 00:41:53.842
If that ain't enough,
I'm gonna run you
in for extortion.

689
00:41:53.843 --> 00:41:55.945
You know,
I'm so stupid sometimes.

690
00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:58.548
Are you?

691
00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:00.816
Now that you mention it, Mr.
Lowrey did mention something
about you coming by tonight.

692
00:42:00.817 --> 00:42:03.452
What did he say?
Did he say he had a key?

693
00:42:03.453 --> 00:42:05.022
Hang out.

694
00:42:06.022 --> 00:42:08.022
Here you go.

695
00:42:06.022 --> 00:42:07.356
Is this it?

696
00:42:07.357 --> 00:42:08.858
Yeah. You're hurting me.

697
00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:10.359
Thank you.
Good to see you.

698
00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.562
Good to see you.

699
00:42:12.562 --> 00:42:14.062
Have fun.

700
00:42:14.063 --> 00:42:15.430
It's not like that.

701
00:42:15.431 --> 00:42:16.431
Sure, sure.

702
00:42:16.432 --> 00:42:18.069
It's not like that.

703
00:42:23.073 --> 00:42:24.374
Yeah, come on.

704
00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:27.276
Watch your step up through here.

705
00:42:27.277 --> 00:42:30.046
Damn, I must've left
some incense burning.

706
00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:32.218
Welcome to Casa de Lowrey.

707
00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:36.853
This is kind of...

708
00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:39.088
I'm always moving my switches.

709
00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:42.124
See, I'm always decorating,
so sometimes I just
don't know where shit is.

710
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:43.160
Damn!

711
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.160
Shit!

712
00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:48.637
Why am I tripping on shit
I know is there?

713
00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:53.869
See, you found a light switch.

714
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:55.505
I should have known it was
there since I decorated
the place.

715
00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:00.543
- Mike, this is Yvette.
- I'm horny...

716
00:43:00.544 --> 00:43:03.046
Ignore this.
It's one of my freaks.

717
00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:05.615
She's always calling,
got to have it.

718
00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.918
Don't call here no more now,
freak! Just one of my freaks.

719
00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.954
All of this
on a cop's salary?

720
00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:12.155
right now, on the table.

721
00:43:12.156 --> 00:43:13.423
Uh, well,

722
00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:14.923
it's honest money.

723
00:43:14.924 --> 00:43:17.228
I'm a second-generation
rich kid.

724
00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:22.067
So if you're not in it for
the pay check, what are you,
some kind of action junkie?

725
00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:25.068
If that's what you
want to call it.

726
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:28.905
I don't mind bats swung
at my head, bullets damn
near grazing my ass.

727
00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:30.207
Gives me a rush.

728
00:43:31.207 --> 00:43:35.077
Look, let me give you a
broad stroke of the place.

729
00:43:35.078 --> 00:43:38.081
I got some T-bones in the
fridge for Lukie and Dukie...

730
00:43:38.082 --> 00:43:43.920
Sorry, your fridge
is this way. I confuse
my own shit.

731
00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:47.456
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You're gonna leave
me here alone?

732
00:43:47.457 --> 00:43:49.425
Yeah, I gotta get
back to the P.D.

733
00:43:49.426 --> 00:43:52.929
These are Miami's
peak crime hours,
you know.

734
00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.497
Apparently.

735
00:43:55.498 --> 00:44:00.302
You know, they said that
this deal was going down
in four days, and I'm...

736
00:44:00.303 --> 00:44:03.372
You know, obviously seem
to be kind of a major glitch
in their...

737
00:44:03.373 --> 00:44:05.508
Hey.

738
00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:09.177
You ain't with the bad guys
now. You're with the cops.

739
00:44:09.178 --> 00:44:11.581
With Mike Lowrey.
You with the cops. Okay?

740
00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:14.983
Everything's gonna be
all right. Trust me.

741
00:44:14.984 --> 00:44:16.653
I'll be back.

742
00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:20.257
I know that it's no time
to joke, but remember
in the movie when...

743
00:44:21.257 --> 00:44:23.992
All right, all right.

744
00:44:23.993 --> 00:44:25.631
Thanks for everything, Mike.

745
00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:28.631
I'm gonna go.

746
00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:35.637
Chet.

747
00:44:35.638 --> 00:44:37.173
That was quick.
You're one of those guys.
In and out.

748
00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:38.675
It's not like that, Chet, okay?

749
00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:40.676
The girl, she's a witness.

750
00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:40.943
Right.

751
00:44:40.944 --> 00:44:42.944
I need you to keep an eye out.

752
00:44:40.944 --> 00:44:42.711
No problem.

753
00:44:42.712 --> 00:44:44.613
All right, now listen
to me. Hear me.

754
00:44:44.614 --> 00:44:45.614
Me? Okay.

755
00:44:45.615 --> 00:44:47.150
That's right.

756
00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:51.720
All right, the moment
Lowrey gets in, you
have him call me at home.

757
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:53.721
Call you at home.

758
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:53.456
At my home.

759
00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:56.059
Use this phone.
Don't let him go upstairs.

760
00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.427
Don't let him upstairs?
But he lives here. I can't
argue with Mr. Lowrey.

761
00:44:58.428 --> 00:45:00.296
I could lose my job.

762
00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:02.297
Chet, trust me on this, okay?

763
00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:02.965
Okay. Call you from here.

764
00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:03.966
Don't let him up.

765
00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:05.001
From here.

766
00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:07.002
Important witness.

767
00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.601
No problem. Okay.

768
00:45:06.602 --> 00:45:08.371
Thank you.

769
00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.505
I got a better idea. I'm
getting off in two hours.

770
00:45:10.506 --> 00:45:12.546
If you want, I could go
upstairs and watch the door.

771
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.445
You know, like cops do in
the movies. Sit on the stool.

772
00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:17.447
I got a magazine and everything.

773
00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:19.548
And I don't let
anybody in or out.

774
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:23.052
Seriously. All kidding
aside, I want to help.

775
00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:24.454
You're helping.
Do that from here.

776
00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:25.955
Can you do it from here?

777
00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:27.756
Yeah, I can do it from here.

778
00:45:27.757 --> 00:45:29.257
Fine. That helps.
From here, okay?

779
00:45:29.258 --> 00:45:31.059
Okay. All right.

780
00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.230
It's funny that you ask me,
I was going to be a cop.

781
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:35.664
I took the test and everything.

782
00:45:35.665 --> 00:45:37.767
You know, just didn't work out.

783
00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:39.635
Politics.

784
00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:41.136
Yeah. I know.
You're my deputy.

785
00:45:41.137 --> 00:45:42.738
I'm your deputy.

786
00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:44.239
From here.
Watch out for everything.

787
00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.041
You got it.

788
00:45:46.042 --> 00:45:48.144
Take care, chief.

789
00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:49.612
I'm a deputy.

790
00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:52.317
Don't "honey-baby" me,
you smell like perfume.

791
00:45:55.386 --> 00:45:58.056
And you don't even have
your wedding ring on!

792
00:46:00.056 --> 00:46:01.056
Damn!

793
00:46:02.459 --> 00:46:04.593
I went undercover,

794
00:46:04.594 --> 00:46:08.430
and so it required taking
off the ring for a second.

795
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:12.300
I got the ring. Look, I just
put my hand in my pocket
because that's where it was,

796
00:46:12.301 --> 00:46:13.605
and it's right back on, baby.

797
00:46:15.605 --> 00:46:16.707
Damn!

798
00:46:17.707 --> 00:46:20.175
Can I get a pillow?

799
00:46:20.176 --> 00:46:23.713
Well, if it isn't
the guy who doesn't
return phone calls.

800
00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:26.548
You mind telling me
where the hell you been
the last 12 hours?

801
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:28.316
Huh? I been
paging you all night!

802
00:46:28.317 --> 00:46:31.186
We got a situation here
that I think you need
to know about.

803
00:46:31.187 --> 00:46:33.722
Look, Marcus,

804
00:46:33.723 --> 00:46:36.526
I got a dead madam,
I got a concussion and
I got a real bad headache.

805
00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:38.126
You got a headache.

806
00:46:38.127 --> 00:46:39.561
Well, let me tell you
what I did last night.

807
00:46:39.562 --> 00:46:41.798
I had to sleep on my couch.

808
00:46:41.799 --> 00:46:44.467
I wake up this morning and
I got a Power Ranger
stuck up my ass.

809
00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:48.336
And while we're discussing
my ass, I damn near got
it blown off.

810
00:46:48.337 --> 00:46:51.139
Guess what the good
news is. I got a witness.

811
00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.140
Marcus. Marcus.

812
00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.409
Let me tell you
about this witness.

813
00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:57.447
Shh. You sound like
a nagging wife.

814
00:46:57.448 --> 00:46:59.282
I'm a nagging...
I'm nagging?

815
00:46:59.283 --> 00:47:02.784
You see what happens
when you go off without me?
You get into shit.

816
00:47:02.785 --> 00:47:05.555
Oh, please, like shit don't
happen when you're there.

817
00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:08.157
That ain't the point, okay?

818
00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:12.427
The point is, if your partner
pages you, you might wanna
get back to your partner.

819
00:47:12.428 --> 00:47:15.164
I want to meet the man
who whupped your ass.

820
00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:18.166
I want to meet who
whupped Shaft's ass.
That's what I want.

821
00:47:18.167 --> 00:47:19.735
Look at me, man.

822
00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:22.238
Last night, you don't know
what I've been through.

823
00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:25.474
My wife done kicked me out
the house. Kicked me out
of a happy home.

824
00:47:25.475 --> 00:47:28.110
But, no. You got to
go off by yourself.

825
00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:30.448
"I got this, partner,
I got this." Bullshit.

826
00:47:32.448 --> 00:47:34.784
I am feeling much better
though. Thank you.

827
00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:35.825
And I'm gonna get his ass.

828
00:47:38.821 --> 00:47:41.124
Watch yourself.

829
00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:44.293
What did I say?
Did you hear what I said?

830
00:47:44.294 --> 00:47:47.363
I heard what I said because
I was standing
there when I said it.

831
00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:51.233
I told you. I told you
to secure a witness,

832
00:47:51.234 --> 00:47:53.401
not to shoot up a neighborhood.

833
00:47:53.402 --> 00:47:57.207
Not to do another dead body.
Just get the dope back,
and do it quietly.

834
00:47:58.207 --> 00:48:01.644
Look, captain. This situation
is getting out of control.

835
00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:04.180
You're goddamn right
it's getting out of control!

836
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:07.386
Look, man, I damn near
had to pass a pop quiz
before she believed I was him.

837
00:48:09.386 --> 00:48:10.686
Going, it's going...

838
00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:13.356
Shit, little off.

839
00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:16.626
I haven't killed anybody
yet today, captain.

840
00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:19.862
Do you want me to yell at you?
Because I can do that.
Let me tell you something.

841
00:48:19.863 --> 00:48:23.633
This witness, it's the only
good news I got.
The only good news.

842
00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:25.534
You guys are bad news.

843
00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:28.938
So, what does that mean?
That means if you have
to be Mike Lowrey,

844
00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:32.708
Santa Claus,
I don't give a shit,
that's what you're gonna be!

845
00:48:32.709 --> 00:48:35.069
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
What the hell is
going on in here?

846
00:48:37.747 --> 00:48:40.449
I was, like, getting them
all in before you showed up.

847
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:44.554
Can somebody
talk to me, please?
Can I know what's going on?

848
00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:48.523
Captain, these fools could
have gotten a look at my
license plate last night.

849
00:48:48.524 --> 00:48:49.663
So where's the girl now?

850
00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:54.663
His place.

851
00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:54.563
What?

852
00:48:54.564 --> 00:48:58.501
You left her by herself?
Our only fucking witness?

853
00:48:58.502 --> 00:49:00.603
You left a strange hooker
alone in my apartment?

854
00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:04.506
The girl is not a hooker,
as far as I know.

855
00:49:04.507 --> 00:49:09.378
I had to stash her
somewhere. Her and her
dogs, Luke and Dukie.

856
00:49:09.379 --> 00:49:12.881
You left dogs in my house?
So there's dogs and a
hooker in my house?

857
00:49:12.882 --> 00:49:15.550
How about you just add
some chimps, okay?
We can have a carnival.

858
00:49:15.551 --> 00:49:17.485
Didn't I just say
she wasn't a hooker?

859
00:49:17.486 --> 00:49:18.966
- Can you please...
- Shut up!

860
00:49:21.457 --> 00:49:24.459
For years, Sinclair has
been up my ass, trying to
pin something on me.

861
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.968
I'm always taking it for you.
Right? Do it for me!

862
00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:34.404
Now, if we get this witness
to ID the shooters, maybe
we catch our bad guys.

863
00:49:35.404 --> 00:49:37.439
But until then,

864
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.874
until then,

865
00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:40.443
you are Mike Lowrey.

866
00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:42.744
You be him, you're him.

867
00:49:42.745 --> 00:49:44.313
You're him!
I don't want to hear it!
You're him.

868
00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:46.648
And you! You be you.

869
00:49:46.649 --> 00:49:49.625
But not in front of her!
You're him, you're you!

870
00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:59.528
Can we get a time-out here,
cap? What am I, like,
the designated homeless?

871
00:49:59.529 --> 00:50:03.865
Hey. Does it look like I care?
Whatever it takes.

872
00:50:03.866 --> 00:50:06.269
What did she say to you?

873
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:09.604
The shooters are gonna
make their drop in four days?
So we got four days.

874
00:50:09.605 --> 00:50:12.608
Captain, what kind
of plan is that?

875
00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:14.809
I can't be shacked up
with that woman.

876
00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:17.283
I have a family to look after.
My wife will kill my ass.

877
00:50:19.283 --> 00:50:20.719
You don't like your job, quit.

878
00:50:23.719 --> 00:50:24.823
Damn!

879
00:50:26.823 --> 00:50:29.825
Look, I'll stay at the house
with Theresa and the kids.

880
00:50:29.826 --> 00:50:34.463
Thank you. But no, thanks,
okay? You won't last
five minutes with my family.

881
00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:36.798
Please, man.
Married life is easy.

882
00:50:36.799 --> 00:50:38.504
You only got one
woman to satisfy.

883
00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:41.871
Yo, man,

884
00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:42.872
we ain't the Cosbys.

885
00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:46.309
Let's go, I got this.

886
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:47.310
Go.

887
00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:52.581
Everybody wants to be like Mike.

888
00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:55.851
Yeah, and you're going
to be retired like him too.

889
00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:58.056
I'd have dunked it on your ass.

890
00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:02.490
Cleveland? I have never...

891
00:51:02.491 --> 00:51:05.494
Hey, look, woman, okay?
Now I done told you, okay?

892
00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:07.063
It's a federal subpoena.

893
00:51:07.064 --> 00:51:08.898
What am I gonna do,
tell them no?

894
00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:11.367
I don't know what you're gonna
tell them, baby.
Why can't he go?

895
00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:13.668
Why can't you go?

896
00:51:13.669 --> 00:51:16.838
Oh, you know, I wanted to,
but Captain Howard said,
you know, I'm irresponsi...

897
00:51:16.839 --> 00:51:20.476
No, he said, "loose cannon."
Because I be shooting
in public.

898
00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:22.577
Just out of nowhere sometimes.

899
00:51:22.578 --> 00:51:24.579
Mike! No, man.

900
00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.080
Please.

901
00:51:26.081 --> 00:51:27.483
All right.

902
00:51:27.484 --> 00:51:31.019
Look, babe, okay?
The neighborhood has
had a lot of break-ins.

903
00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.787
I can handle it.
I don't need Mike.

904
00:51:32.788 --> 00:51:34.590
I know you can handle it,

905
00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:37.726
but I'm worrying about me.
Mike's going to stay here.

906
00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:41.697
Take care of y'all.
Just till I come back.

907
00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.932
Who's gonna pick
the kids up from day care
and all that stuff?

908
00:51:43.933 --> 00:51:44.934
Mike can't do it.

909
00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:47.635
Are you listening to me, baby?
I said, Mi...

910
00:51:47.636 --> 00:51:51.606
Hey, I read a book that
could probably help y'all.

911
00:51:51.607 --> 00:51:54.744
Mike, please, man.
Can you go down and have
a Coke and a smile?

912
00:51:54.745 --> 00:51:56.745
Please.

913
00:51:54.745 --> 00:51:56.647
All right.

914
00:51:58.647 --> 00:51:59.647
Y'all want something?

915
00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:03.718
Bring me a Coke, Mike.
Baby, you want a Coke?

916
00:52:03.719 --> 00:52:05.521
I'm fine, thank you.

917
00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:06.522
- Mike.
- All right.

918
00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:17.900
So explain it to me, Elliot.
We've got a problem
with our chemistry set?

919
00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:20.001
It's not a chemistry set.

920
00:52:20.002 --> 00:52:22.042
He knows it ain't
a chemistry set,
asshole.

921
00:52:27.042 --> 00:52:28.843
So, what is it?

922
00:52:28.844 --> 00:52:30.982
The cutting agent
is a highly volatile...

923
00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.148
substance.

924
00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:35.149
The ether...

925
00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:34.816
I don't care.

926
00:52:34.817 --> 00:52:37.019
I don't care! I don't care!

927
00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.689
I'm not a fucking
chemistry teacher, Elliot.

928
00:52:40.689 --> 00:52:42.425
So, what is the problem?

929
00:52:42.426 --> 00:52:45.427
The problem is that there's
too much moisture down here.

930
00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:47.428
Yeah, it's totally fucked.

931
00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:47.899
You shut up!

932
00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:50.166
Okay.

933
00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:52.568
So, what else?

934
00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:54.804
It's taking longer
to cook than
we originally planned.

935
00:52:54.805 --> 00:52:58.106
And if we rush it,
we're gonna have a lot
of drugs that we can't sell.

936
00:52:58.107 --> 00:53:02.077
You're fucking with my
timetable here. I gave you
a deadline. You understand?

937
00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:04.078
Do you understand?

938
00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:03.882
I understand.

939
00:53:06.882 --> 00:53:08.818
Julie!

940
00:53:08.819 --> 00:53:10.556
Yeah.

941
00:53:12.556 --> 00:53:13.923
Oh.
Oh, um...

942
00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:15.924
Hi.

943
00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:15.791
You dressed?

944
00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:19.528
Yeah, I am.

945
00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:24.032
Look, we gotta go through
some mug shots. So I'm gonna
hook into the computer,

946
00:53:24.033 --> 00:53:25.177
- and we can do this.
- Hey, Mike,

947
00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:27.105
Who's the guy in all
the photographs?

948
00:53:30.105 --> 00:53:34.577
Sometimes I don't even
look at my shelf and I forgot
all the pictures was here.

949
00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:39.113
That's my partner.
Yeah, that's my partner,
Marcus Burnett.

950
00:53:39.114 --> 00:53:42.151
I've never seen anything
like this before.

951
00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:44.720
Well, I can see how it
may throw you a little bit.

952
00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:46.755
You know what?
It's a cop thing.

953
00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:48.036
Yeah, these pictures are up here

954
00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:49.959
for every time he saved my life.

955
00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:54.829
It's the same thing with him.
You go to his place, ain't
nothing but pictures of me.

956
00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:56.965
Because it's like a
shrine. Just a reminder.

957
00:53:56.966 --> 00:53:59.802
Oh.

958
00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:04.005
Because, I mean, when
I saw it, the whole wall,
I thought maybe they were,

959
00:54:04.006 --> 00:54:05.673
you know,
pictures of your lover.

960
00:54:05.674 --> 00:54:07.642
Of who?

961
00:54:07.643 --> 00:54:09.883
I thought that... You know,
I thought maybe you were gay.

962
00:54:10.814 --> 00:54:12.247
I was gay?

963
00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:15.284
Nah, nah, nah, baby.

964
00:54:15.285 --> 00:54:19.521
I mean, I didn't mean to
offend you. You know, it's
okay to be a homosexual, Mike.

965
00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:23.559
No, you're not listening.
It's not registering, okay?

966
00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:27.829
Believe me. Did you
sleep in the bed? You
didn't feel the dents?

967
00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:29.697
Yeah, the dents
come from all that.

968
00:54:29.698 --> 00:54:31.602
That's how I gets down.
Oh, that's...

969
00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:34.670
sweet.

970
00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:38.009
Gay. Psh. If I was,
I'd change the drapes
in this motherfucker.

971
00:54:40.009 --> 00:54:41.009
No.

972
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:47.549
You want some?

973
00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:48.717
No, thanks.

974
00:54:48.718 --> 00:54:50.154
I don't eat flesh.

975
00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:52.787
What?

976
00:54:52.788 --> 00:54:54.990
That's flesh that you're

977
00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:57.760
shoveling into your mouth.

978
00:54:57.761 --> 00:55:01.832
You know, that was a living,
breathing creature, you know.
It probably had a name.

979
00:55:03.832 --> 00:55:05.733
It's just bologna.

980
00:55:05.734 --> 00:55:08.037
My bologna has a first name.

981
00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:10.207
Well, actually, your bologna
has about 30 names,

982
00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:15.010
you know, because they
take, like, odd parts from
all different ones.

983
00:55:15.011 --> 00:55:19.715
You know, like, the leftovers,
like the hooves,
stomach lining, ears,

984
00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:25.119
stuff like that. You know.
They put it into this machine
and, like, grind it all up.

985
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.227
And then out comes, like,
this sheet. That's what
you're eating now.

986
00:55:31.227 --> 00:55:33.662
Okay.

987
00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:35.063
You know what?

988
00:55:35.064 --> 00:55:38.066
I don't eat bologna no more.
How about a pickle?

989
00:55:38.067 --> 00:55:40.702
Can I eat the pickle?

990
00:55:40.703 --> 00:55:42.871
Well, there's a lot of salt
in it, but, yeah, it's fine.
It is a vegetable.

991
00:55:42.872 --> 00:55:44.207
Lot of salt in the pickle?

992
00:55:45.207 --> 00:55:49.047
Okay, let me rinse...
Let me rinse it off.
There we go. There we go.

993
00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:53.115
Hm? How's that?

994
00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:55.383
Just... Let's keep going.

995
00:55:55.384 --> 00:55:56.991
I don't even taste the salt now.

996
00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:01.991
Go back. Go back.

997
00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:10.099
That's the guy.

998
00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.203
He was there, in the room.

999
00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:17.139
We got a tip they was running
some major druggage in there,
something like 50 keys.

1000
00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.273
So we steps to the door. Boom!

1001
00:56:19.274 --> 00:56:22.778
"Freeze! Miami P.D.!
Get down, get down, get down!"

1002
00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:25.014
Out of nowhere,
this little crazy pimp
named Chino punched me

1003
00:56:25.015 --> 00:56:26.949
in the head with
some brass knuckles.

1004
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:28.751
So I'm like, "Ah."
Chino's been running
ho's up in there,

1005
00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:30.653
but your dad will
explain that to you.

1006
00:56:30.654 --> 00:56:35.791
Look at it. Your dogs,
they shitting all over
my place. Liquid shit.

1007
00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:39.827
It doesn't help, you going
around shellacking it in
with furniture polish.

1008
00:56:39.828 --> 00:56:42.130
There's a piece right
there. Please, get that.

1009
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:44.131
Fine. I got it.

1010
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:43.736
Look like a chip of shit.

1011
00:56:46.736 --> 00:56:49.972
Francine, can I please
have the parole jacket
on Noah Trafficante?

1012
00:56:49.973 --> 00:56:51.973
- Thank you.
- You know what, man?

1013
00:56:51.976 --> 00:56:54.242
I'm getting tired
of this witness, man.

1014
00:56:54.243 --> 00:56:57.012
I wanna get back to my life
the way it was.

1015
00:56:57.013 --> 00:57:00.416
I'm tired. Okay, I got married
so I could stop lying.

1016
00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:02.684
You know what? I cannot
believe you're complaining.

1017
00:57:02.685 --> 00:57:04.787
You got it easy compared to me,

1018
00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:06.223
living in that
zoo you call home.

1019
00:57:07.223 --> 00:57:09.157
Why you got to call
my place a zoo?

1020
00:57:09.158 --> 00:57:10.658
I'm tired of you
talking that stuff.

1021
00:57:10.659 --> 00:57:11.959
Now you want to fight me.

1022
00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.460
Don't call my place no zoo, man.

1023
00:57:13.461 --> 00:57:15.167
Listen, Francine, please...

1024
00:57:17.167 --> 00:57:18.968
Yo, that's my silk shirt, man!

1025
00:57:19.968 --> 00:57:22.304
Yeah. It's kind of nice.

1026
00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:26.275
I figure since I'm gonna
be like Mike, I might as well
dress like Mike. You know.

1027
00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:29.077
I wanna be,
I wanna be like Mike.

1028
00:57:29.078 --> 00:57:31.746
Pow! Huh?

1029
00:57:31.747 --> 00:57:34.016
You're sick.
Something's wrong with you.

1030
00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:36.985
You have a problem and you
should have yourself checked.

1031
00:57:36.986 --> 00:57:37.986
Probably.

1032
00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:41.255
Here's the file.
He worked at Club Hell.

1033
00:57:41.256 --> 00:57:42.256
Thank you. Thank you.

1034
00:57:42.457 --> 00:57:46.096
Can you take care of this,
please? I gotta call the wife.

1035
00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:50.365
Whose wife?
Can you please do some work?

1036
00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:52.366
One time today,
just do something!

1037
00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:52.967
I'm gonna tell you...

1038
00:57:52.968 --> 00:57:54.836
Do something that
helps this case.

1039
00:57:54.837 --> 00:57:56.305
Boy.

1040
00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:58.474
You look real
handsome today,
Marcus.

1041
00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:03.077
No, see, it's not
that kind of day. Okay?
Leave me the fuck alone.

1042
00:58:03.078 --> 00:58:04.912
Seriously.
All right?

1043
00:58:04.913 --> 00:58:06.180
What's up, babe, PMS?

1044
00:58:06.181 --> 00:58:07.749
No, damn the jokes.

1045
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.117
Damn them.

1046
00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:10.221
Ring it. Ain't in the mood.

1047
00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:13.825
Yeah, that's cool. Hold on.

1048
00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:16.828
Okay. Go ahead.

1049
00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:21.963
Mm-hm. All right.

1050
00:58:21.964 --> 00:58:23.499
How are things
going with the kids?

1051
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.001
They're fine.
You okay?

1052
00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:28.002
How's that
potty-training thing going?

1053
00:58:28.003 --> 00:58:30.072
Slowly, but surely.

1054
00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:32.173
You're so silly.

1055
00:58:32.174 --> 00:58:34.674
You gonna be late tonight?

1056
00:58:34.675 --> 00:58:36.912
It'll be 10:30,
11:00 before I get in.

1057
00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:38.833
- No, don't wait up.
- I'll be there.

1058
00:58:43.819 --> 00:58:45.521
So yeah, why don't you
rent a movie or something?

1059
00:58:45.522 --> 00:58:48.093
You know. Something
we can kick back to.

1060
00:58:51.093 --> 00:58:55.093
So, what you wearing?

1061
00:58:51.093 --> 00:58:54.296
Give me the phone!
Give it! Baby!

1062
00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:58.800
She hung up a long time ago.
I was playing. I was playing.

1063
00:58:58.801 --> 00:59:00.301
Hello?

1064
00:59:00.302 --> 00:59:02.037
I was playing.

1065
00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:06.474
Hey, man. Don't play that.
That's my family. Don't break
up a happy home.

1066
00:59:06.475 --> 00:59:08.980
Stop wearing my clothes then.

1067
00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:15.285
Everybody about the
motherfucking jokes
today, ain't they? Hello.

1068
00:59:16.285 --> 00:59:19.153
I can't believe this.

1069
00:59:19.154 --> 00:59:21.889
Come on, Francine, this
Eddie Dominguez file can't
be that hard to get into.

1070
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:23.892
I tried three times,
I just can't get in.

1071
00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:26.829
Besides, you know,
this is illegal.

1072
00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:31.166
Well, yeah, that never
stopped you before. Just let
me know if you get anything.

1073
00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:34.584
Anything for you.
But I can't get in. I tried.

1074
00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:49.584
What's up, Chet?

1075
00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:49.383
Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

1076
00:59:49.384 --> 00:59:51.384
Chet.

1077
00:59:49.384 --> 00:59:51.323
Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

1078
00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:57.191
Okay. The Lowrey Brothers.

1079
00:59:57.192 --> 01:00:00.612
Let's just get down to
Club Hell and pick up Noah.

1080
01:00:01.029 --> 01:00:04.066
Julie, it's me!

1081
01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:06.501
What's up? You're supposed
to be getting us into this
Eddie Dominguez file.

1082
01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:09.104
It's gonna be a day or two.

1083
01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:11.105
We don't have no day or two.

1084
01:00:11.106 --> 01:00:13.008
I'm not the computer whiz.

1085
01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:15.510
It's gonna take a while before
we can hack the computer.

1086
01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.011
You not taking care of shit.

1087
01:00:17.012 --> 01:00:19.046
Mike, listen,
I was thinking...

1088
01:00:19.047 --> 01:00:20.951
Hi.

1089
01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.451
You must be Marcus.

1090
01:00:23.452 --> 01:00:24.552
Marcus. I'd be Marcus.

1091
01:00:24.553 --> 01:00:25.553
That's right.

1092
01:00:25.554 --> 01:00:27.088
Marcus, right?

1093
01:00:27.089 --> 01:00:28.956
I'm Julie.

1094
01:00:28.957 --> 01:00:32.360
Julie. All right.
Nice to meet you.

1095
01:00:32.361 --> 01:00:34.963
You too.
I recognized you from

1096
01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:36.664
every one of the photographs.

1097
01:00:36.665 --> 01:00:39.205
Oh. Well, it's my man,
you know.

1098
01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.572
The wall. Yeah,
those on the wall.

1099
01:00:44.573 --> 01:00:46.573
You must be very good.

1100
01:00:46.574 --> 01:00:49.144
I'm sorry?

1101
01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:53.916
As a partner.
Given your job, what you do.

1102
01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:56.517
What time are we
doing this thing tonight?

1103
01:00:56.518 --> 01:00:58.518
Excuse me?

1104
01:00:56.518 --> 01:00:58.323
Mike said that
we're going to a club.

1105
01:01:01.323 --> 01:01:02.590
Yeah, well, "we,"

1106
01:01:02.591 --> 01:01:04.659
as in me and my partner.

1107
01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:08.162
You wanted home protective
custody. You at my house.

1108
01:01:08.163 --> 01:01:10.599
Oh, that's just great.

1109
01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.936
So I'll just stay here again
with Chet the mini-moron
doorman to protect me?

1110
01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.171
Chet is very good.

1111
01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:18.372
Oh, I'm so...

1112
01:01:18.373 --> 01:01:22.110
That looks like a stain
on your rug. Damn.

1113
01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:25.947
That was my baby, Luke.
He gets kind of nervous
in new surroundings...

1114
01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:28.450
And he just shits, huh?

1115
01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:32.186
Well, it's sort of... It's
like marking his territory
It's sort of a male thing.

1116
01:01:32.187 --> 01:01:35.289
I offered to pay Mike
for the cleaning and
he wouldn't hear of it.

1117
01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:38.193
I'm gonna get rid of it.
Yeah, you don't need that.

1118
01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:41.530
Yeah, I was going to throw
that out anyway, you know
I just want a new look.

1119
01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.499
Mike, he's a special guy.
That Mike is special.

1120
01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.068
That's what I call him,
Special Mike.

1121
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:48.637
It's funny...
I like how you can

1122
01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:50.972
just laugh at that.
That's why...

1123
01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:56.677
I love him. Now, me,
whoo! I'd be pissed.

1124
01:01:56.678 --> 01:01:59.347
Oh, and look at this cute
little dog on the couch.

1125
01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:01.583
That's Luke.

1126
01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:04.086
Look how he just crawls
around on the leather.

1127
01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:08.289
You want to meet Duke?
He's in the bed. He's been
feeling sort of upset

1128
01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:11.193
and having diarrhea
and throwing up all morning.

1129
01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.061
Oh, baby.

1130
01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:16.197
Let's go see if little Duke is
going to be okay, shall we?

1131
01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.308
Me and you. Me and you.

1132
01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:28.075
Oh, Mike.

1133
01:02:28.076 --> 01:02:29.276
Hey, lady,
who are you?

1134
01:02:29.277 --> 01:02:30.679
Who the hell are you?

1135
01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.920
Look,
you gotta get out.

1136
01:02:32.214 --> 01:02:34.615
Get your hands off me!
Lady, don't push me!

1137
01:02:34.616 --> 01:02:36.616
I'm Yvette.

1138
01:02:34.616 --> 01:02:36.418
Well, you not the Yvette I know.

1139
01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:37.519
Get your hands off me!

1140
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.720
Hey, what are you doing?

1141
01:02:39.721 --> 01:02:43.227
Get out of here, all right?
If you don't stop stalking me,
I'm gonna arrest your ass.

1142
01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:45.228
You old psycho!

1143
01:02:46.228 --> 01:02:47.228
You asshole!

1144
01:02:47.229 --> 01:02:49.098
Woman's into some weird shit.

1145
01:02:50.098 --> 01:02:51.535
What's going on out here?

1146
01:02:53.535 --> 01:02:54.735
That was crazy Yvette.

1147
01:02:54.736 --> 01:02:56.573
Stalking me. Ha.

1148
01:02:58.573 --> 01:03:02.082
Yvette?
You threw Yvette out?

1149
01:03:07.082 --> 01:03:10.082
Yvette is a masseuse.

1150
01:03:07.082 --> 01:03:09.221
Mm-hm.

1151
01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:15.456
She massages shit.

1152
01:03:15.457 --> 01:03:17.526
She told me.

1153
01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:21.496
Hey, listen, are there any
other totally hysterical,

1154
01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:25.566
half-naked women
popping by tonight that
I should know about?

1155
01:03:25.567 --> 01:03:28.567
She was naked?

1156
01:03:25.567 --> 01:03:28.235
Titties were out a little bit.

1157
01:03:28.236 --> 01:03:29.806
You threw Yvette out naked?

1158
01:03:33.475 --> 01:03:34.776
My wife would hate...

1159
01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:38.280
She hates womanizers.

1160
01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:41.682
I don't believe... You see...
Something wrong with you.

1161
01:03:41.683 --> 01:03:43.717
You don't respect
other people's shit,
that's your problem.

1162
01:03:43.718 --> 01:03:44.687
I've been telling you for years.

1163
01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:48.090
Ever since we started,
your trash is all over.

1164
01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:49.359
Enough! Please!

1165
01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:52.561
Me and my partner,

1166
01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:56.298
we're going to
Club Hell so we can
bust this fool Noah.

1167
01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:57.779
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

1168
01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.437
Fine.

1169
01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:02.881
Don't blow the case.

1170
01:04:12.881 --> 01:04:15.249
Okay, Frank,
here's the deal, okay.
You stay put.

1171
01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:17.485
Anybody tells
you to move, don't.
I don't care what they say.

1172
01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:19.621
Tell them you're making
a delivery for Fouchet.

1173
01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:21.558
You got it? You got it? Frank?

1174
01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:24.263
It's ether!
It'll explode, you dope!

1175
01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:29.444
Don't even breathe,
you knucklehead!

1176
01:04:42.444 --> 01:04:44.278
Noah.

1177
01:04:44.279 --> 01:04:45.634
I remember you.

1178
01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.401
Check it, Lowrey...

1179
01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:09.403
We got two days left.
Let's try to do this right.

1180
01:05:09.404 --> 01:05:12.474
No gunshots, no dead bodies.

1181
01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:14.776
I'm not trying to lose
my job on this one.

1182
01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:18.579
Well, you know, if I recall,
the last couple dead bad guys
belonged to you.

1183
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.814
And next time you
have to kill them,

1184
01:05:20.815 --> 01:05:24.920
why don't you do it after you
get the information that
we need. Just a suggestion.

1185
01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:29.523
Please. You ain't even trying
to compare body counts.

1186
01:05:29.524 --> 01:05:31.626
Should I keep going
all day? I'm out.

1187
01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:33.595
I'm out.

1188
01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:36.630
This guy Noah's parole jacket
says he works in there.

1189
01:05:36.631 --> 01:05:39.934
We're standing out
front arguing like a
couple of schoolgirls.

1190
01:05:39.935 --> 01:05:43.572
What do you say we put an
end to all this bickering?

1191
01:05:43.573 --> 01:05:46.340
Because you starting to
get on my goddamn nerves.

1192
01:05:49.611 --> 01:05:51.265
He got no package.

1193
01:06:10.265 --> 01:06:12.367
Look at you! Look at you!

1194
01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:13.868
Can you stay focused?

1195
01:06:13.869 --> 01:06:15.903
What you talking about?
I'm focused.

1196
01:06:15.904 --> 01:06:18.606
Yeah. Focused on
all this scattered
ass around here.

1197
01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:20.775
Let's do what we came
to do and get the fuck
out of here.

1198
01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:22.776
Simple.

1199
01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:22.343
Fine.

1200
01:06:22.344 --> 01:06:23.778
Let's just split up,
check around.

1201
01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:25.347
Meet you at
the bar in 10 minutes.

1202
01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:26.348
Fine.

1203
01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:26.786
Fine.

1204
01:06:31.786 --> 01:06:34.655
Holy shit,
what the hell is he doing?

1205
01:06:34.656 --> 01:06:38.325
Oh, man! That's the cop!
There he is! See him?

1206
01:06:38.326 --> 01:06:40.899
That's him! I'm going.

1207
01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.305
What's up?

1208
01:06:51.306 --> 01:06:53.374
Whoo...

1209
01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:55.991
Budweiser. Feel like I had
a million of them.

1210
01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:10.839
What's up, motherfucker?

1211
01:07:24.839 --> 01:07:26.910
Tell me where the
girl is, jack-off!

1212
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:03.756
Oh, fuck!

1213
01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:16.559
Next time, learn how to work
the safety with your punk-ass.

1214
01:08:17.559 --> 01:08:18.559
I'll be back.

1215
01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:29.803
Who done tore off and
whupped your ass now?

1216
01:08:29.804 --> 01:08:32.674
This ain't the time.
This really ain't
the fucking time.

1217
01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:34.925
Look. They know. Let's get
Noah and get out of here.

1218
01:08:50.925 --> 01:08:53.561
Hey, it's the chick.
Look, the chick!

1219
01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:55.523
The girl.
The bitch from the rooftop!

1220
01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:21.990
Julie!

1221
01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:39.808
Let's go!

1222
01:09:39.809 --> 01:09:41.117
That was the guy who shot Maxie!

1223
01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:50.785
The truck! Come on,
let's take the truck!

1224
01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:52.085
There! Right there! Go!

1225
01:09:52.086 --> 01:09:54.054
Move it! Move it!

1226
01:09:54.055 --> 01:09:55.859
We're really in a hurry.

1227
01:09:57.859 --> 01:09:59.693
Let's go!

1228
01:09:59.694 --> 01:10:02.729
You're cops! Why are we
running away? He's in there!

1229
01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:04.076
Here! Go!

1230
01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:15.576
This is good.

1231
01:10:15.577 --> 01:10:16.912
Noah's chasing us!

1232
01:10:17.912 --> 01:10:20.048
What was that?

1233
01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.549
What the...
What was that?

1234
01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:24.853
That was...
I don't know.

1235
01:10:24.854 --> 01:10:28.014
But I had a perfectly good
shot at him if your friend
Action Jackson over here...

1236
01:10:29.657 --> 01:10:32.794
No! No! This is official
police business!

1237
01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:36.763
You had no business in there!
And can you please
drive this thing?

1238
01:10:36.764 --> 01:10:38.264
Please drive!

1239
01:10:38.265 --> 01:10:39.800
Don't bring it here, all right?

1240
01:10:39.801 --> 01:10:41.881
You're the one who picked a
slow-ass ice-cream truck!

1241
01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:46.074
What am I smelling?
Just drive!

1242
01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.575
What am I smelling?

1243
01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:48.742
Ether.

1244
01:10:48.743 --> 01:10:50.978
Extremely flammable ether.

1245
01:10:50.979 --> 01:10:52.246
Oh, shit.

1246
01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:53.747
Goddamn.

1247
01:10:53.748 --> 01:10:55.282
You the man!

1248
01:10:55.283 --> 01:10:57.518
You the fucking man tonight!

1249
01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:59.926
How you gonna pick an
ice-cream truck that's
a damn bomb?

1250
01:11:04.926 --> 01:11:06.294
Shit!

1251
01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.595
This is protective custody?

1252
01:11:08.596 --> 01:11:09.803
Yes!

1253
01:11:16.671 --> 01:11:18.889
Oh, shit!

1254
01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:35.889
You better do something, boy!
Because we're
running out of road!

1255
01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:37.991
Who picked this dumb-ass road?

1256
01:11:37.992 --> 01:11:40.794
All the goddamn road in Miami
and you run out of it!

1257
01:11:40.795 --> 01:11:42.830
You gotta come up
with an idea, fast!

1258
01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:44.912
Why I gotta come up
with all the ideas?

1259
01:11:57.912 --> 01:11:59.746
Take this shit!

1260
01:11:59.747 --> 01:12:01.925
We're coming to a dead end!
There's no more road!

1261
01:12:10.925 --> 01:12:13.031
We out of fucking road!

1262
01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:19.349
Motherfucker's going to blow!
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

1263
01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:36.918
Well...

1264
01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:38.657
Should I add this
to your body count?

1265
01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:44.726
There goes our
only lead to the dope.

1266
01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:45.727
Ain't this a bitch.

1267
01:12:47.395 --> 01:12:50.397
The dope? The do...

1268
01:12:50.398 --> 01:12:53.166
What are you talking about?

1269
01:12:53.167 --> 01:12:57.638
How about, "There goes
our only lead to Max's
killer"? He's still out there.

1270
01:12:57.639 --> 01:13:01.275
Oh, but, I mean, that's not
really important 'cause
it's not like

1271
01:13:01.276 --> 01:13:03.143
it's your job to protect
people. Holy shit.

1272
01:13:03.144 --> 01:13:06.144
See what I'm saying?
She's crazy!

1273
01:13:03.144 --> 01:13:05.350
I'm crazy?

1274
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:11.285
You're gone!

1275
01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:14.321
What's wrong with you?
Stop it! Marcus!
This is the witness!

1276
01:13:14.322 --> 01:13:17.058
She done zoomed.
That's it, you deal with her.

1277
01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:19.059
No way.

1278
01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.726
Julie.

1279
01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:21.428
Listen, yes, okay, you're right.

1280
01:13:21.429 --> 01:13:25.098
This whole thing started
because of missing drugs.
But let me tell you something,

1281
01:13:25.099 --> 01:13:29.437
there's nothing,
absolutely nothing,
more important to Mike

1282
01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:33.040
than doing this guy
that killed Max.

1283
01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:36.447
I know, sometimes
he has a hard time
expressing his real feelings.

1284
01:13:39.447 --> 01:13:42.750
Come on. It's gonna
be all right, okay?

1285
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:43.819
We need you.

1286
01:13:44.819 --> 01:13:46.920
Part of the team.

1287
01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:49.693
I thought he was
supposed to be the smooth one.

1288
01:13:51.693 --> 01:13:53.960
This has not
been a good day.

1289
01:13:53.961 --> 01:13:58.098
Damn right. This is
bullshit. We got two
days to find these fools,

1290
01:13:58.099 --> 01:14:00.819
and we got no leads
because you cooked Noah's
ass back on the freeway.

1291
01:14:05.139 --> 01:14:06.639
Shampoo?

1292
01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.144
Hello.

1293
01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:11.114
Well, let's just
do that.

1294
01:14:13.114 --> 01:14:14.114
- What's up?
- Hey.

1295
01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:21.888
Julie, it don't take that
long to get shampoo.

1296
01:14:21.889 --> 01:14:23.889
Come on, please, let's go.

1297
01:14:21.889 --> 01:14:24.025
Look at this.

1298
01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:25.960
"Animal tested.
Animal tested."

1299
01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:28.963
Do you know how many
chemicals are in this stuff?

1300
01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:32.066
I don't care if you go bald.
Just get it and let's go.

1301
01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:34.000
Jojo.

1302
01:14:34.001 --> 01:14:36.470
He is a chemist.

1303
01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:39.072
It's entirely too much
heroin and too much ether
for nobody to know nothing.

1304
01:14:39.073 --> 01:14:41.875
What's he talking about?

1305
01:14:41.876 --> 01:14:44.411
Well, you know the barrels
of ether that blew up
on the ice-cream truck?

1306
01:14:44.412 --> 01:14:46.880
They were gonna use
that to process the heroin.

1307
01:14:46.881 --> 01:14:49.349
Yeah, they do that to cut it.
It, like, quadruples
the value.

1308
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:53.019
Yeah, you can't
just nuke it.

1309
01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:54.380
Let's just pay for this,
all right?

1310
01:14:58.393 --> 01:15:00.393
Hey, how much is that?

1311
01:14:58.393 --> 01:15:01.161
$14.25.

1312
01:15:01.162 --> 01:15:03.397
Damn, you know what?
I must've left
my wallet somewhere.

1313
01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:05.236
Freeze, motherbitches!

1314
01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:08.236
Don't you move.

1315
01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:09.070
Wait...

1316
01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:12.071
I'm not understanding.
I really don't.

1317
01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:11.505
Shut up!

1318
01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:13.506
Do you just
attract violent people?

1319
01:15:13.507 --> 01:15:15.543
Shut the fuck up!

1320
01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:18.312
Take it easy, all right?
We're police officers.

1321
01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:21.848
You're not police officers.
I'm not stupid. I know.

1322
01:15:21.849 --> 01:15:23.849
Wait.

1323
01:15:21.849 --> 01:15:23.817
I know. I've seen police.

1324
01:15:23.818 --> 01:15:25.220
I'm gonna reach
for my badge, okay?

1325
01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:28.255
You want badges, motherbitch?

1326
01:15:28.256 --> 01:15:29.924
I give you badges!

1327
01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:33.094
Here! 99 cents each.
I sell you some.

1328
01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:35.897
He got eight fucking
badges. I told you this
cop thing don't work.

1329
01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:39.400
I blow you! Then I blow you!

1330
01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:42.937
Blow me? What the fuck?
No, hump me, that's all right.

1331
01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:45.372
I kill before. I kill again.

1332
01:15:45.373 --> 01:15:46.373
Please! Hold on!

1333
01:15:46.374 --> 01:15:47.407
I'm gonna blow you!

1334
01:15:47.408 --> 01:15:49.844
No, you hold on!

1335
01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:53.281
Do you see the fucking emotion
I'm going through right now?
That means this is serious.

1336
01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:57.084
That means me and this
motherfucker is not vibing
now. That's what that means.

1337
01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:58.585
You got something on your chest?

1338
01:15:58.586 --> 01:16:00.086
I got something!

1339
01:16:00.087 --> 01:16:02.087
Hello! The guy's got a cannon.

1340
01:16:02.088 --> 01:16:03.424
What do you want?

1341
01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:05.425
You want some?
Then come get it.

1342
01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:05.593
I want some.

1343
01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:07.094
I'm gone!

1344
01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:08.528
Hey, freeze, bitch!

1345
01:16:08.529 --> 01:16:10.130
You freeze, bitch!

1346
01:16:10.131 --> 01:16:12.202
Oh, shit. I'm fucked.

1347
01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:15.303
Now back up.

1348
01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:18.907
Put the gun down. And
get me a pack of tropical
fruit Bubblicious.

1349
01:16:19.907 --> 01:16:21.480
And some Skittles.

1350
01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.250
Hell of a night.
I'm going to bed.

1351
01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:32.255
So make yourself at home.
It's your bed.

1352
01:16:34.255 --> 01:16:36.523
I'll sit down, you know, for...

1353
01:16:36.524 --> 01:16:38.491
For a minute.
You know, because...

1354
01:16:38.492 --> 01:16:43.063
I'm guarding shit,
you know. I'm watching
out for the bad boys.

1355
01:16:43.064 --> 01:16:45.201
I can see things
real well, you know,

1356
01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:48.001
from my peripherals.

1357
01:16:48.002 --> 01:16:50.470
You know, for such
a stud, Mike Lowrey,

1358
01:16:50.471 --> 01:16:54.510
you sure seem a little rigid
about having a girl
in your bed.

1359
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:57.010
Who?

1360
01:16:57.011 --> 01:16:59.948
Me? Mike Lowrey?
I'm not rigid.

1361
01:17:00.948 --> 01:17:02.650
I'm comfortable.

1362
01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:05.220
It's my bed. Why would
I be uncomfortable?

1363
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.656
I don't know. You know,
I think it's more than
just wired.

1364
01:17:09.657 --> 01:17:13.027
I mean, maybe it was
guns and stuff.

1365
01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:14.995
I mean, I've never really
shot a gun before.

1366
01:17:14.996 --> 01:17:17.898
All that, I don't know, steel...

1367
01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:21.304
I'm feeling... Don't you
feel a little funny?

1368
01:17:23.304 --> 01:17:25.305
I'm not a comedian, but...

1369
01:17:25.306 --> 01:17:27.609
I don't mean
that kind of funny,
I mean, like...

1370
01:17:28.609 --> 01:17:29.620
funny.

1371
01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.620
You don't want that.

1372
01:17:40.621 --> 01:17:43.657
You don't want that,
because when I come,

1373
01:17:43.658 --> 01:17:45.425
I come with the thunder.

1374
01:17:45.426 --> 01:17:46.426
And that's...

1375
01:17:45.426 --> 01:17:47.193
Mike.

1376
01:17:47.194 --> 01:17:49.267
You sound like you're
saving yourself for marriage.

1377
01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:54.437
No, that ain't me there.

1378
01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:57.170
That's Marcus.

1379
01:17:57.171 --> 01:18:00.107
You know what I'm saying?
He's the married one.

1380
01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:01.210
I got some other...
Oh, no.

1381
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:04.711
I done seen it now.
Turn the page.

1382
01:18:04.712 --> 01:18:06.112
No.

1383
01:18:06.113 --> 01:18:07.833
Turn the page, girl.
I done already seen it.

1384
01:18:09.283 --> 01:18:11.419
Don't laugh.

1385
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.455
No. I cannot believe
he wore his Afro that big.

1386
01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:15.956
I forgot all about that.

1387
01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:18.092
He looked cute
like that, I think.

1388
01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.299
What's Marcus' wife like?

1389
01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:26.433
She's like a wife.

1390
01:18:26.434 --> 01:18:28.969
Well, I mean, she must be pretty

1391
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:30.608
amazing to keep
a guy like Marcus.

1392
01:18:34.608 --> 01:18:37.010
Keep a guy like what?

1393
01:18:37.011 --> 01:18:40.613
Well, you know, watching
him tonight, he's very...

1394
01:18:40.614 --> 01:18:42.450
sort of take charge.

1395
01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:46.120
The way he was throwing
guys this way and that.

1396
01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:50.991
You know, there's something
about him. I don't know
what it is. He's so smooth.

1397
01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:51.992
Boy...

1398
01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.728
I bet...

1399
01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:57.202
his wife's enjoying the
smoothness right this minute.

1400
01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:02.202
He got a quality
women respond to.

1401
01:19:02.203 --> 01:19:04.405
Sure.

1402
01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:08.409
I can't imagine
the kind of woman
that wouldn't find Marcus...

1403
01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.478
attractive.

1404
01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:13.446
Probably couldn't
be around him and...

1405
01:19:13.447 --> 01:19:15.218
just, you know,
like our situation.

1406
01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:17.718
If two people were alone...

1407
01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:20.053
No, not with a guy like that.

1408
01:19:20.054 --> 01:19:21.054
Excuse me.

1409
01:19:25.426 --> 01:19:27.327
What is wrong with him?

1410
01:19:27.328 --> 01:19:30.497
This one goes on the
bulletin board at work.

1411
01:19:31.499 --> 01:19:33.134
Don't do that. No, come on.

1412
01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:35.803
Mike, put it back in, I can't
believe you took it out.

1413
01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:39.072
Come on. Marcus will kill us
if he finds out.
Give it to me.

1414
01:19:39.073 --> 01:19:41.142
I can't believe
I let you see it.

1415
01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:42.143
Motherfucker!

1416
01:19:49.483 --> 01:19:51.085
Goddamn it.

1417
01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:53.187
Got some jewelery for you.

1418
01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:55.755
I'm sorry, but damn that.

1419
01:19:55.756 --> 01:20:00.760
Whoa. I think we need to
address this serious lack
of trust in this relationship.

1420
01:20:00.761 --> 01:20:03.761
Please.

1421
01:20:00.761 --> 01:20:03.830
Is this legal?
I don't think it's legal.

1422
01:20:03.831 --> 01:20:04.831
I won't be long.

1423
01:20:05.466 --> 01:20:06.466
Oh, it's legal.

1424
01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:08.772
Out of sight.

1425
01:20:10.772 --> 01:20:13.741
Yeah, Sanchez, Lowrey.
Yeah, your mother. Listen.

1426
01:20:13.742 --> 01:20:16.309
I think these guys
are about to make a move.

1427
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:18.830
Blue convertible.
Two visible occupants.
Check it out, all right?

1428
01:20:25.519 --> 01:20:27.456
Hey, hey, hey. Here we go.
Is that our guy?

1429
01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:30.391
Where's the girl?

1430
01:20:30.392 --> 01:20:31.828
I don't see any girl.

1431
01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:41.139
Fuck off,
barking-ass dog.
Shut up!

1432
01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:45.841
Sneak up on my own
motherfucking house.

1433
01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:48.509
What in the world?

1434
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.809
Very strange.

1435
01:20:49.810 --> 01:20:53.446
His ass is upstairs.
Supposed to be my boy!

1436
01:20:53.447 --> 01:20:55.281
You motherfucker!

1437
01:20:55.282 --> 01:20:57.585
Like ducking and weaving,
up and down.

1438
01:20:57.586 --> 01:21:00.120
Look at this shit.
This is what you want?

1439
01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:02.622
Got me climbing like
a fucking chimp.

1440
01:21:02.623 --> 01:21:05.259
No, I ain't going out like that.

1441
01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.331
Don't take nobody that
goddamn long to get in bed.

1442
01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:12.566
Got my babies in the house.

1443
01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:15.302
The man can't get
no quality time,

1444
01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:18.616
but, oh, yeah, my partner
can get some quality time.
I don't play that shit.

1445
01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:29.150
Oh, my God.
Somebody's out there!

1446
01:21:29.151 --> 01:21:30.431
Get the kids.
Get the kids!

1447
01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:35.589
I knew it! I didn't
even have to call
a fucking psychic line.

1448
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:36.595
Freeze!

1449
01:21:41.595 --> 01:21:44.898
Move, and you're dead.

1450
01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:47.902
Gun right up
to his head. Gonna shoot each
other. This is unbelievable.

1451
01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:51.604
Miami Police! Freeze!
I am the police!

1452
01:21:51.605 --> 01:21:52.906
Marcus, what are you doing?

1453
01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:55.907
You're doing Theresa!

1454
01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:55.276
No, I'm not!

1455
01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.277
You're doing my baby!

1456
01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.413
Marcus, shut up!

1457
01:21:59.413 --> 01:22:02.348
We could sneak up and
snuff them both right now.

1458
01:22:02.349 --> 01:22:03.918
Yeah, but we're
supposed to get the girl.

1459
01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:07.420
Never fuck with
a cop's family, asshole.

1460
01:22:07.421 --> 01:22:09.421
Doesn't that piss you off?

1461
01:22:07.421 --> 01:22:09.589
That pisses
the fuck out of me.

1462
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:11.693
Yeah, yeah.
Don't get me started.
Get out of the car.

1463
01:22:12.693 --> 01:22:14.695
Motherfucker!

1464
01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:16.930
This whole shit is
making you crazy, man!

1465
01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:19.451
You know damn well ain't
nothing going on between
me and Theresa!

1466
01:22:23.205 --> 01:22:25.939
Man, I've been your
partner for six years

1467
01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.375
and I've been
your boy all my life.

1468
01:22:28.376 --> 01:22:30.344
For you to even think...

1469
01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:33.680
To even let some
dumb shit like that creep up
in your mind!

1470
01:22:33.681 --> 01:22:35.350
This is me, man!
What's wrong with you?

1471
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:38.487
Man, fucking...

1472
01:22:40.487 --> 01:22:41.647
- Mike!
- I'm just...

1473
01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:48.762
I'm fine!

1474
01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:50.997
Get the fuck out of here,
man! Where's Julie?

1475
01:22:50.998 --> 01:22:53.567
She's in the car, handcuffed
to the steering wheel.

1476
01:22:53.568 --> 01:22:55.702
Are you trying to
blow this whole case?

1477
01:22:55.703 --> 01:22:57.705
My bad. I ain't
had no quality time.

1478
01:22:57.706 --> 01:23:00.447
You know how that shit is.
Sometimes you do dumb shit.

1479
01:23:06.447 --> 01:23:07.447
My bad, all right?

1480
01:23:07.448 --> 01:23:08.715
It's cool, man.

1481
01:23:08.716 --> 01:23:10.922
Go, go. All right.

1482
01:23:14.922 --> 01:23:17.958
These phone calls
were made to Club Hell
from this precinct.

1483
01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:20.893
Explain.

1484
01:23:20.894 --> 01:23:24.897
I'm gonna ask you one more
time. Give me a name.
Give me a goddamn name!

1485
01:23:24.898 --> 01:23:28.701
Okay. Okay.

1486
01:23:28.702 --> 01:23:31.405
All I know is his name.
Give me his name.

1487
01:23:31.406 --> 01:23:33.973
You're looking at a lot
of time, you know that?

1488
01:23:33.974 --> 01:23:36.043
Fouchet.

1489
01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:37.745
Fouchet, I think.

1490
01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:39.479
That's his whole name,
"Fouchet"?

1491
01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:42.816
Fouchet.
I'm just an errand boy.

1492
01:23:42.817 --> 01:23:44.918
Stop it, please.
You're gonna make me cry.

1493
01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:47.821
I swear. Watching the house
was my first gig.

1494
01:23:47.822 --> 01:23:49.582
How sweet.
Does that make you union?

1495
01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:53.027
You know something?
If you were a real cop,

1496
01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:55.329
in the field, working every day,

1497
01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:56.830
you'd realize that shit happens.

1498
01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:58.898
Don't give me that crap.

1499
01:23:58.899 --> 01:24:01.669
You know, you're on your
way to being reassigned.
Shut down.

1500
01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:03.736
Who's gonna reassign me? You?

1501
01:24:03.737 --> 01:24:05.738
You don't have the
authority to reassign me.

1502
01:24:05.739 --> 01:24:09.543
So until you do,
stay the hell out of here!

1503
01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:11.781
They should just bone
and get that shit over with.

1504
01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:15.081
I'm getting
really tired of this.

1505
01:24:15.082 --> 01:24:16.453
You're tired?

1506
01:24:19.453 --> 01:24:23.357
They're overfed, they're lazy.
We need video surveillance.

1507
01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:25.358
These guard dogs are nothing.

1508
01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:26.026
Jojo!

1509
01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:28.032
Don't make this hard!

1510
01:24:32.032 --> 01:24:33.933
Nice running into you, Jojo.

1511
01:24:33.934 --> 01:24:37.103
Always making it
hard on yourself, Jojo.

1512
01:24:37.104 --> 01:24:40.040
Gee, Julie, what have you been
up to the last couple of days?

1513
01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:44.044
Oh, nothing. Just hanging out,
handcuffed to steering wheels.

1514
01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:46.979
Now we're looking for
someone who could step
on a shit-load of heroin.

1515
01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:49.849
Do it real fast, real well.
We're looking for
a real pro, Jojo.

1516
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:52.853
Well, I told you already, I'm
in the rubber business now.

1517
01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:56.089
Jojo, we're not playing, man.

1518
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:57.590
Huh?

1519
01:24:57.591 --> 01:24:59.093
I'm telling you,
man, I'm straight.

1520
01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:03.664
I'm straight like a board,
like an arrow. I'm so
straight, it's sick.

1521
01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:07.101
Jojo. It's a lot of dope, man.
Who could cut it real quick?

1522
01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:10.070
Cut it?
Cut it up?

1523
01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:11.675
I'm sick of this bullshit.

1524
01:25:13.675 --> 01:25:14.978
Bullshit!

1525
01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:18.478
What's up, yo?

1526
01:25:18.479 --> 01:25:19.679
You're pulling a gun on me?

1527
01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:23.016
You guys are cops!
I can't believe this. I should
turn you in to Hard Copy.

1528
01:25:23.017 --> 01:25:25.017
Put your ass on TV.

1529
01:25:23.017 --> 01:25:24.718
What you doing?

1530
01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:28.388
I got this. Jojo...

1531
01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:30.389
I got 15 bullets in this gun.

1532
01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:30.790
Mike!

1533
01:25:30.791 --> 01:25:33.126
I swear, if you don't start
talking to me, I'm gonna fill
your lying ass

1534
01:25:33.127 --> 01:25:35.396
full of some hot shit.
What's up?

1535
01:25:35.397 --> 01:25:37.030
He's a former ganja-smoking
motherfucker.

1536
01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:39.031
He ain't worth it.

1537
01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:38.831
Do you want some?

1538
01:25:38.832 --> 01:25:39.832
I'll bust your ass too!

1539
01:25:41.435 --> 01:25:43.437
So sad.

1540
01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:44.674
You're on your own, Jojo.

1541
01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:47.974
What's up, Jo?

1542
01:25:47.975 --> 01:25:49.643
But I'm gonna
tell you like this,

1543
01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:53.479
you splatter his ass,
he's no good to us.
Fuck that.

1544
01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:55.749
Fuck that. I'm not going
down over this shit.

1545
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:58.885
I'm not going down for you
killing Jojo the tire man!

1546
01:25:58.886 --> 01:26:01.421
Okay, okay.

1547
01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:04.558
Fuck that! I don't want
no brain on me. Shit gets
in your clothes and it stinks.

1548
01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:05.559
Okay.

1549
01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.692
Fuck that, Jojo!

1550
01:26:06.693 --> 01:26:08.594
I'll tell you what I know.
I don't know everything.

1551
01:26:08.595 --> 01:26:10.630
I know a little bit
about a little bit.

1552
01:26:10.631 --> 01:26:12.900
Tell him something, Jo.

1553
01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:14.634
There's three guys.

1554
01:26:14.635 --> 01:26:16.635
They got a laboratory...
No, no.

1555
01:26:16.770 --> 01:26:19.642
It's two guys. One guy died in
a plane crash last year.

1556
01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:23.576
There needs to be more!

1557
01:26:23.577 --> 01:26:27.013
No, it's one guy, really.
It's only one guy.

1558
01:26:27.014 --> 01:26:28.848
Don't fuck with me, Jojo.

1559
01:26:28.849 --> 01:26:32.486
This guy's an Einstein,
motherfucking
genius college boy,

1560
01:26:32.487 --> 01:26:35.488
fucking egghead motherfucker.
He got four eyes and glasses.

1561
01:26:35.489 --> 01:26:37.558
He got a rich mom and daddy
who live in Coconut Grove.

1562
01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:40.059
Where?
Tell him again, Jojo!

1563
01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:41.180
I'll tell you where it's at.

1564
01:26:43.096 --> 01:26:44.464
You'd do that
for us, Jojo?

1565
01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:49.803
Yeah. I want to help.
Stick that gun down.
I got the address...

1566
01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:50.973
in the...

1567
01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:53.175
office.

1568
01:26:55.175 --> 01:26:57.175
Thanks. Why don't
you go grab that.

1569
01:26:57.176 --> 01:26:58.778
Cool.

1570
01:26:58.779 --> 01:26:59.779
You can go ahead.

1571
01:26:58.779 --> 01:27:00.147
Now?

1572
01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:02.482
Yeah, now's good.
Now is real good.

1573
01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:04.684
This is on me.

1574
01:27:04.685 --> 01:27:07.965
Why don't you pick out some
whitewalls for yourselves.
A little gift from me to you.

1575
01:27:10.791 --> 01:27:13.559
You made me think
you were going to
shoot me for a minute.

1576
01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.032
I was.

1577
01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:20.267
Man, when's
this punk-ass chemist
coming home?

1578
01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:22.236
So...

1579
01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:24.237
this is a stakeout.

1580
01:27:24.238 --> 01:27:26.506
Not what I imagined.

1581
01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:28.210
Thought there'd be
more conversation.

1582
01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.580
Sorry, it's not up to your

1583
01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.215
usual high standards.

1584
01:27:35.215 --> 01:27:37.851
Is he always like
this on a stakeout?

1585
01:27:37.852 --> 01:27:40.653
What is it?
Too much caffeine?

1586
01:27:40.654 --> 01:27:42.822
Not enough sex?

1587
01:27:42.823 --> 01:27:45.692
Ooh, I can't believe
she went there on you.

1588
01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:48.562
You don't know who
you talking to?

1589
01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:51.098
That's Mike Lowrey over there.

1590
01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:53.567
King Ding-a-ling.

1591
01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:55.869
Go ahead, why don't you whip
it out for her, big boy?

1592
01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:57.870
Uh-huh, right on your forehead.

1593
01:27:57.871 --> 01:27:58.871
Yeah.

1594
01:27:57.871 --> 01:27:59.149
Shut up.

1595
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:10.183
There he is!
Let's go!

1596
01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:12.184
Let's go! Move!

1597
01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:11.300
I'm on him!

1598
01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.035
What are our chances?

1599
01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:30.036
Well, remember Club Hell?

1600
01:28:30.037 --> 01:28:31.037
Worse.

1601
01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:35.142
That's it.
Call major backup.

1602
01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:38.077
I want motherfucking
swimming ducks in here.

1603
01:28:38.078 --> 01:28:40.680
Whoa, hold it.
Come on, man.

1604
01:28:40.681 --> 01:28:44.884
You know Sinclair got every
phone in the station tapped.
We gotta do that in person.

1605
01:28:44.885 --> 01:28:47.754
Shit. By the time
we deal with her bullshit,

1606
01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:50.160
every junkie in America
will be high off our bust.

1607
01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.361
Can we help you?

1608
01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:59.333
Hey, I staked out all night
in the back of that jalopy
too. I think I earned a peek.

1609
01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:03.803
Hey, this is real cop stuff,
okay? This is not
Charlie's Angels.

1610
01:29:03.804 --> 01:29:06.138
All right, all right.
Can't hurt for
her to take a peek.

1611
01:29:06.139 --> 01:29:09.720
It can't hurt to look?
If they fire a goddamn
bullet over here, it'll hurt!

1612
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.920
We have guests.

1613
01:29:20.921 --> 01:29:23.721
Have them followed.
Don't do anything, just
call me with their location.

1614
01:29:30.697 --> 01:29:34.934
This high-speed chase, ending
on a trestle near the River
Drive and 34th Street,

1615
01:29:34.935 --> 01:29:36.775
was captured two nights ago
by our news team.

1616
01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.144
Mom!

1617
01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:45.411
I thought you said
Daddy was in Cleveland.

1618
01:29:45.412 --> 01:29:47.680
Can't be in Cleveland.

1619
01:29:47.681 --> 01:29:49.950
The officers
didn't like our cameras.

1620
01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:53.253
No, baby. Your daddy just
wishes he was in Cleveland.

1621
01:29:53.254 --> 01:29:57.758
I'm telling you,
this Fouchet, he's slick.

1622
01:29:57.759 --> 01:30:00.960
FBI, DEA, they got
nothing on him.

1623
01:30:00.961 --> 01:30:02.875
But he got to
deal with us today.

1624
01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:16.375
What's that?

1625
01:30:16.376 --> 01:30:19.912
That's the last time
they ever handcuff me.
That's what that is.

1626
01:30:19.913 --> 01:30:20.913
Good boy.

1627
01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.986
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am!

1628
01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:27.920
All visitors must be announced!

1629
01:30:27.921 --> 01:30:29.090
Pisses me off!

1630
01:30:30.090 --> 01:30:33.293
Lady! Lady!

1631
01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:36.396
I guess when you guys
get back,
this'll all be over, right?

1632
01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:38.197
You got that right.

1633
01:30:38.198 --> 01:30:41.401
Now don't worry, though.
You'll be set free.

1634
01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:42.869
Cut loose.

1635
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:45.974
You'll be back to your own life.

1636
01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:48.345
No more handcuffs.

1637
01:30:53.113 --> 01:30:55.113
I'm out of here.

1638
01:30:55.114 --> 01:30:56.817
That's Chet with
my veggie burger.

1639
01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.422
Move your ass.
You got it.

1640
01:31:02.422 --> 01:31:04.857
Hi, can I help you?

1641
01:31:04.858 --> 01:31:07.928
Yes, I'm here to kill
my husband, Marcus Burnett.

1642
01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:10.964
And that'd be the tall one
or the short one?

1643
01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:12.000
The short one.

1644
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.867
Thought so.

1645
01:31:14.868 --> 01:31:16.236
Is Chet
ringing the...

1646
01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:17.806
Oh, babe!

1647
01:31:19.806 --> 01:31:24.311
Um, Theresa. Uh...

1648
01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:29.348
Let me get your husband.
Marcus, get over here.

1649
01:31:29.349 --> 01:31:33.221
Okay. I know what
it looks like. Did you get
my message?

1650
01:31:34.221 --> 01:31:35.221
Huh?

1651
01:31:35.222 --> 01:31:37.057
Um...

1652
01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:39.125
Can you...

1653
01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:42.928
leave me and
Mrs. Burnett alone?

1654
01:31:42.929 --> 01:31:44.134
Right.

1655
01:31:46.134 --> 01:31:47.301
Y'all met?

1656
01:31:48.301 --> 01:31:50.169
Baby...

1657
01:31:50.170 --> 01:31:53.240
I know... So let me...

1658
01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:56.910
As far as I'm concerned,
you can keep the wedding
ring in your pocket,

1659
01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:59.012
because you and
your little girlfriend...

1660
01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:00.412
Oh, shit.

1661
01:32:00.413 --> 01:32:04.183
And Mike will all be
very happy living here.

1662
01:32:04.184 --> 01:32:05.951
Sweetie! Sweetie, honey!

1663
01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:09.421
It's not even...

1664
01:32:09.422 --> 01:32:11.359
Uh-uh.
No, no, I saw it on the news.

1665
01:32:12.359 --> 01:32:14.398
That shit be having a slant.

1666
01:32:17.398 --> 01:32:19.499
No, you're no longer
welcome to my house.

1667
01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:22.803
He didn't tell you I was
coming in the airport early?

1668
01:32:22.804 --> 01:32:26.372
Remember, I said call her,
that you was gonna bring me
to your place? Hold on.

1669
01:32:26.373 --> 01:32:28.141
Tell her about
what I told you, man.

1670
01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:31.142
You were gonna bring me here...

1671
01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:30.212
Julie!

1672
01:32:32.212 --> 01:32:34.215
All right.
Ain't even going to...
You know, no.

1673
01:32:35.215 --> 01:32:37.083
We're not arguing about this.

1674
01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.985
Okay. I'm raising my...

1675
01:32:38.986 --> 01:32:40.486
All right... Baby!

1676
01:32:40.487 --> 01:32:42.488
Believe me,
we wanted to tell you.

1677
01:32:42.489 --> 01:32:44.324
You know what?
It really doesn't
matter anymore,

1678
01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:47.827
Marcus... Mike, Kojak,
whatever your name is, okay?

1679
01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:50.062
Aside from the fact,
I'll tell you something else,

1680
01:32:50.063 --> 01:32:54.000
if his wife can find us,
I'm a lot better off
on my own.

1681
01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.835
This...

1682
01:32:55.836 --> 01:32:57.336
I can see how it
would look a trip.

1683
01:32:57.337 --> 01:32:58.405
Uh-huh.

1684
01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:01.273
You see me, I run out,
I got a shirt open.

1685
01:33:01.274 --> 01:33:03.442
You see Mike,
he half-butt-naked.

1686
01:33:03.443 --> 01:33:05.512
Then you see the white girl.

1687
01:33:05.513 --> 01:33:08.949
So the shit looks like
we having one big
motherfucking orgy,

1688
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:10.416
and ain't nobody humped.

1689
01:33:10.417 --> 01:33:13.152
I'm telling you.
Ain't nobody doing none
of that.

1690
01:33:13.153 --> 01:33:15.988
It's not what it
looks like, okay?
Hear what I'm saying.

1691
01:33:15.989 --> 01:33:18.458
Baby, she's a material witness.

1692
01:33:18.459 --> 01:33:19.459
That...

1693
01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:21.094
That's real!

1694
01:33:21.095 --> 01:33:22.963
Baby, Theresa, listen.

1695
01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:27.500
It was orders.
Listen, it was orders.

1696
01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:31.170
Julie, can I talk to you?
Can you stop so I can
talk to you, please?

1697
01:33:31.171 --> 01:33:32.938
Enough with
the smooth shit, Mike.

1698
01:33:32.939 --> 01:33:34.885
It's not going to work anymore.

1699
01:33:43.885 --> 01:33:45.459
I don't care what you say!

1700
01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:52.992
Duck!

1701
01:33:52.993 --> 01:33:54.326
Julie, get down!

1702
01:33:54.327 --> 01:33:56.126
Get down!

1703
01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:28.228
Get out!

1704
01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:29.069
Mike!

1705
01:34:36.069 --> 01:34:38.174
911!

1706
01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:42.675
Yeah. 911? Yeah. Chet here.

1707
01:34:42.676 --> 01:34:44.614
Go upstairs and take
this! Take it!

1708
01:34:47.614 --> 01:34:49.974
Don't worry.
I'll keep everybody
calm until my backup arrive.

1709
01:34:50.216 --> 01:34:51.487
I love you, Marcus.

1710
01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:55.047
Shit, I forgot to give
them the address!

1711
01:35:31.224 --> 01:35:32.659
Go, go, go!

1712
01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:33.660
Watch it! Watch it!

1713
01:35:34.228 --> 01:35:36.165
Keep going!

1714
01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:39.165
Get her in!

1715
01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:08.761
Move!

1716
01:36:22.643 --> 01:36:24.411
It's okay.

1717
01:36:24.412 --> 01:36:26.706
I'm with the police.
It's cool.
You look great.

1718
01:36:53.706 --> 01:36:54.706
Drive!

1719
01:37:31.545 --> 01:37:33.894
Don't ever say
I wasn't there for you.

1720
01:37:46.894 --> 01:37:48.495
What is it
with you guys?

1721
01:37:48.496 --> 01:37:49.862
How come it always has to be
good news/bad news?

1722
01:37:51.364 --> 01:37:53.465
You know exactly
where the dope is,

1723
01:37:53.466 --> 01:37:55.268
but you lose
our only witness.
I just don't get it!

1724
01:37:55.269 --> 01:37:56.738
Lowrey, pick up
your phone!

1725
01:37:58.738 --> 01:37:59.738
Lowrey.

1726
01:37:58.738 --> 01:38:00.139
Hi, Mr. Lowrey.

1727
01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:02.241
I'm keeping your
sweet little friend

1728
01:38:02.242 --> 01:38:04.677
for four hours,
until I make my deal.

1729
01:38:04.678 --> 01:38:07.479
And I will make my deal.

1730
01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.516
I just put
a bullet in the chemist

1731
01:38:09.517 --> 01:38:11.319
who fucked with my timetable.

1732
01:38:13.319 --> 01:38:15.223
The other one is for the girl.
Okay?

1733
01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:17.693
Son of a bitch!

1734
01:38:20.693 --> 01:38:23.428
That twisted motherfucker
just shot one
of his employees.

1735
01:38:23.429 --> 01:38:25.464
Says if we don't back up,
he's gonna kill Julie.

1736
01:38:25.465 --> 01:38:27.467
Not now.

1737
01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:29.335
I told you to play by the rules.

1738
01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:31.870
Don't do this to me
now. I'm on the verge
of solving this case!

1739
01:38:31.871 --> 01:38:35.174
You turned South Beach into a
war zone. I've finally got the
authority to shut you down.

1740
01:38:35.175 --> 01:38:36.535
As of today, you're
all reassigned.

1741
01:38:43.216 --> 01:38:45.485
All right, this guy is
painting me into a corner.

1742
01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:48.388
Look. He's gonna
kill the girl anyway.
We won't let her die.

1743
01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:51.657
And we're not walking away
from this bust, I don't give
a shit what she says.

1744
01:38:51.658 --> 01:38:54.561
So the deal goes
down in four hours.

1745
01:38:54.562 --> 01:38:56.402
That means you guys
got two hours to find them.

1746
01:38:58.364 --> 01:39:00.666
It's time to get lucky.

1747
01:39:00.667 --> 01:39:01.667
Go do what you got to do.

1748
01:39:04.537 --> 01:39:09.409
Look, Fletcher, you
kind of told us this thing
would move a little quicker.

1749
01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:12.711
Hey, man, it's not that easy,
okay? If it was that easy,
you guys would be doing it.

1750
01:39:12.712 --> 01:39:15.949
Hey, man. Work your magic.
You say you're
a computer whiz.

1751
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:18.250
Hey, man.
Back up off me, okay?

1752
01:39:18.251 --> 01:39:20.652
I'm doing an illegal favor
for you.

1753
01:39:20.653 --> 01:39:24.790
Okay, this is what I got
put in jail for in the first
place. So you back up off me.

1754
01:39:24.791 --> 01:39:28.393
Man, you don't sit your lanky
ass down, bottom line,

1755
01:39:28.394 --> 01:39:31.731
I will knock you the fuck out!
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

1756
01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:33.866
Can you have a seat?
You said you'd
get me out of jail.

1757
01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:35.871
And I wasn't lying, Fletcher.

1758
01:39:38.871 --> 01:39:40.742
Cops are so dumb.
Look, it's coming up.

1759
01:39:42.742 --> 01:39:44.513
Remember, you promised
to get me out.

1760
01:39:46.513 --> 01:39:47.683
Eddie Dominguez.

1761
01:39:49.683 --> 01:39:51.587
There it is. Voila.

1762
01:39:54.587 --> 01:39:55.897
Girlfriend?

1763
01:40:03.897 --> 01:40:07.567
I was New Year's Eve
and my ex-boyfriend Eddie,

1764
01:40:07.568 --> 01:40:10.003
and this French guy,

1765
01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:12.772
they took some really
horrible pictures of me.

1766
01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.641
And they said

1767
01:40:14.642 --> 01:40:18.710
that they'd put them up on the
bulletin board at
my kid's school,

1768
01:40:18.711 --> 01:40:22.014
unless I gave them a lot
of narcotics information.

1769
01:40:22.015 --> 01:40:26.286
But I never...
I never gave them you
or the girl.

1770
01:40:26.287 --> 01:40:29.789
Look, they got the girl.
We need to get them now.

1771
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:33.459
Because if we don't, they're
gonna kill her. How do you
make contact?

1772
01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:34.764
I have their
mobile-phone number.

1773
01:40:37.764 --> 01:40:40.333
I know, I'm sorry. Listen.

1774
01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:43.369
Mike, I'll make it up to you.
I will.
I'll do anything you want.

1775
01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:45.076
We don't have a lot
of time. Let's go.

1776
01:40:49.076 --> 01:40:51.510
You have such sexy
ears, you know that?

1777
01:40:51.511 --> 01:40:52.945
I want to lick them.

1778
01:40:56.684 --> 01:40:58.750
Yeah.
Can I speak to Romeo?

1779
01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:02.655
No, there ain't no Romeo here,
asshole. Who you laughing at?

1780
01:41:02.656 --> 01:41:06.959
Now this cell phone will keep
triangulating him, no matter
where he goes.

1781
01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.831
We'll watch this on this
map until he stops.

1782
01:41:11.831 --> 01:41:13.433
Sector 2-3-4.

1783
01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:14.434
The signal's still strong.

1784
01:41:14.435 --> 01:41:15.871
We still have a lock.

1785
01:41:18.871 --> 01:41:21.441
Thank you.

1786
01:41:21.442 --> 01:41:23.976
Lucy was the queen, baby.
Think about it.

1787
01:41:23.977 --> 01:41:26.478
Lucille Ball was a bimbo.
What are you talking about?

1788
01:41:26.479 --> 01:41:27.979
Desi was the whole
brains behind it.

1789
01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:29.348
How could you say that?

1790
01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:30.817
What do you mean
how can I say that?

1791
01:41:30.818 --> 01:41:33.018
Take the bongos away,
he's nothing.

1792
01:41:33.019 --> 01:41:35.420
It's conga, don't be so stupid.

1793
01:41:35.421 --> 01:41:37.589
Yo, fellas,
what's up?

1794
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:39.726
The fucking
pencil squad.

1795
01:41:39.727 --> 01:41:41.728
Hey, what, you get us
assigned to traffic duty?

1796
01:41:41.729 --> 01:41:44.565
No, this is real.
We got something for you.

1797
01:41:45.565 --> 01:41:46.805
This shit could get you killed.

1798
01:41:50.804 --> 01:41:51.804
Let's go.

1799
01:42:02.549 --> 01:42:03.549
Here we go!

1800
01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:06.919
It's Conrad.

1801
01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.890
I'm calling in a favor.

1802
01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:12.995
Eastbound
towards 135th Street.

1803
01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:17.129
Northeast, keep going northeast.

1804
01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:20.400
If I'm wrong about this,
you can fire my ass.

1805
01:42:20.401 --> 01:42:22.134
This is what I need,

1806
01:42:22.135 --> 01:42:24.970
I need a SWAT team, helicopters.

1807
01:42:24.971 --> 01:42:28.077
We're calling all cars here,
baby. Only I don't know
where we need them.

1808
01:42:30.077 --> 01:42:32.077
Very nice car you got there.

1809
01:42:32.078 --> 01:42:33.412
Oh, yeah.

1810
01:42:33.413 --> 01:42:35.147
That's my toy.

1811
01:42:35.148 --> 01:42:37.849
I'm taking it with me
for my collection.

1812
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:41.188
And how about
the wire transfers?

1813
01:42:42.188 --> 01:42:45.724
Two wire transfers
to your banks,

1814
01:42:45.725 --> 01:42:47.529
totaling 180 million dollars.

1815
01:42:49.529 --> 01:42:50.636
And 20 in cash.

1816
01:42:56.636 --> 01:42:57.709
Damn.

1817
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:04.212
This has been a shitty week.

1818
01:43:06.212 --> 01:43:08.554
Getting full integration
on that signal.

1819
01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:16.054
Yeah, we're on the airfield now.

1820
01:43:16.055 --> 01:43:18.215
You know what, I bet it's up
in the old hangar section.

1821
01:43:23.996 --> 01:43:26.166
Let's bring it up!
Pick it up!

1822
01:43:27.166 --> 01:43:29.701
Deposit confirmation requested.

1823
01:43:29.702 --> 01:43:31.710
90 million,
Geldersbank of Zurich.

1824
01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:37.844
No easy approach.

1825
01:43:37.845 --> 01:43:39.644
No time.
Fuck the backup.

1826
01:43:39.645 --> 01:43:40.683
We gotta go now.

1827
01:43:42.683 --> 01:43:44.120
Not a problem.

1828
01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:49.040
What, do you got an itch?
I'd love to scratch it.

1829
01:43:49.857 --> 01:43:51.824
Scratch this.

1830
01:43:51.825 --> 01:43:55.073
I'll scratch whatever
you want me to,
you blue-eyed bitch.

1831
01:44:07.073 --> 01:44:08.073
Thank you.

1832
01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:11.443
You guys sure you
want to do this?

1833
01:44:11.444 --> 01:44:12.945
Hey, look, let's go!

1834
01:44:12.946 --> 01:44:15.821
Tuck in your skirt. Come on!
My shit always
works sometimes!

1835
01:44:20.821 --> 01:44:23.836
This is the best you can
buy. It's been very nice
doing business with you.

1836
01:44:35.836 --> 01:44:36.836
Oh, shit.

1837
01:44:38.304 --> 01:44:40.304
Fouchet, it's a setup!

1838
01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:47.713
If I get killed,
I'm fucking you up!

1839
01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:53.089
Goddamn it, go, go, go!

1840
01:44:56.089 --> 01:44:57.089
Go, goddamn it!

1841
01:45:09.736 --> 01:45:11.876
Okay, okay.

1842
01:45:15.876 --> 01:45:17.013
My God!

1843
01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:04.299
Julie!

1844
01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:13.822
Oh, motherf...

1845
01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:36.822
Get down!

1846
01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:40.997
Shit!

1847
01:46:44.997 --> 01:46:47.002
You forgot your boarding pass!

1848
01:47:10.991 --> 01:47:12.926
You motherfuckers!

1849
01:47:13.926 --> 01:47:14.926
What's up?

1850
01:47:16.862 --> 01:47:17.866
Oh, shit!

1851
01:48:11.885 --> 01:48:14.120
Mike, let's go!

1852
01:48:14.121 --> 01:48:15.759
Mike, get in the car!

1853
01:48:18.759 --> 01:48:19.961
Get in! Come on!

1854
01:48:21.961 --> 01:48:24.961
Let's go! Get in!

1855
01:48:21.961 --> 01:48:24.796
Get in the car,
goddamn it!

1856
01:48:24.797 --> 01:48:26.901
Get in!
This shit's going to blow!

1857
01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:29.791
Get up!

1858
01:48:50.791 --> 01:48:54.293
Oh, shit! Please, catch that
motherfucker, he shot me.

1859
01:48:54.294 --> 01:48:56.829
He shot you, he shot me!
You all right?

1860
01:48:56.830 --> 01:49:00.270
I'm fine. I just had a little
run-in with your friend Jim
Brown over here, but I'm fine.

1861
01:49:01.401 --> 01:49:02.934
He steals our shit,

1862
01:49:02.935 --> 01:49:04.469
kidnaps Julie,

1863
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:07.045
shoots at my wife.
We beating him down!

1864
01:49:12.045 --> 01:49:14.813
Marcus, I just got
one question for you, bro.

1865
01:49:14.814 --> 01:49:16.247
How the hell you
gonna leave my ass

1866
01:49:16.248 --> 01:49:18.017
at a gunfight to go get the car?

1867
01:49:18.018 --> 01:49:19.898
You have got to shut up
and let him drive, okay?

1868
01:49:28.295 --> 01:49:30.695
Seem like that gunshot
wound has improved
your driving skills.

1869
01:49:35.202 --> 01:49:36.562
You got the right
to remain silent.

1870
01:49:39.339 --> 01:49:40.839
Anything you say can and will be

1871
01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.540
used against you
in a court of law.

1872
01:49:42.541 --> 01:49:44.043
Yo, man,
what the fuck are you doing?

1873
01:49:44.044 --> 01:49:45.156
Getting it out the way.

1874
01:49:56.156 --> 01:49:57.897
Just punch it, man!
Punch it! Go!

1875
01:50:03.897 --> 01:50:06.631
This car's faster.
This is a faster fucking car!

1876
01:50:06.632 --> 01:50:09.639
It's gonna be one or the
other, baby! It's gonna be
him or it's gonna be us!

1877
01:50:13.639 --> 01:50:15.279
You better fucking win,
that's all I know!

1878
01:50:16.108 --> 01:50:17.631
You better win!
You better win!

1879
01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:40.900
Now that's how you
supposed to drive!

1880
01:50:40.901 --> 01:50:42.403
From now on,
that's how you drive!

1881
01:51:09.962 --> 01:51:10.962
Freeze!

1882
01:51:16.670 --> 01:51:18.175
He ain't even
worth killing, man.

1883
01:51:23.175 --> 01:51:24.636
Freeze!

1884
01:51:50.636 --> 01:51:55.174
Fouchet. I bet when
your punk-ass woke
up this morning,

1885
01:51:55.175 --> 01:51:58.448
you didn't think about
5:00 you'd have a hole
in your leg, did you?

1886
01:52:02.448 --> 01:52:06.050
You couldn't kill me,
you chickenshit, could you?

1887
01:52:06.051 --> 01:52:08.053
Oh, no. I could.
You're talking like it's over.

1888
01:52:08.054 --> 01:52:10.455
I was just pausing.

1889
01:52:10.456 --> 01:52:14.058
See, I'm starting to get the
hang of this whole marksman
shit, you know what I mean?

1890
01:52:14.059 --> 01:52:17.495
That shooting them from
30 yards while they running
away, no, that's not it.

1891
01:52:17.496 --> 01:52:19.531
Here's where it is, right here.

1892
01:52:19.532 --> 01:52:21.232
Point blank,
up close and personal.

1893
01:52:21.233 --> 01:52:23.067
Mike.

1894
01:52:23.068 --> 01:52:25.637
That's what I'm talking about.

1895
01:52:25.638 --> 01:52:27.138
Would you do it?

1896
01:52:27.139 --> 01:52:29.143
Mike, step off.

1897
01:52:30.143 --> 01:52:33.080
Do it. Do it!

1898
01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.080
Do it!

1899
01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:43.129
It's over.

1900
01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:50.562
He's a joke.

1901
01:52:50.563 --> 01:52:52.657
He's a motherfucking joke.

1902
01:53:17.657 --> 01:53:21.427
I ever tell you
I love you, man?

1903
01:53:21.428 --> 01:53:25.430
Yeah, you know you
always be getting emotional
after gunfights.

1904
01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:27.532
Just because
I'm glad we survived.

1905
01:53:27.533 --> 01:53:29.468
Shit.

1906
01:53:29.469 --> 01:53:31.337
What you talking about?

1907
01:53:32.337 --> 01:53:35.441
I love you too, man.

1908
01:53:35.442 --> 01:53:38.610
Don't be looking at me.
I said, yeah, I love you.
I said that shit.

1909
01:53:38.611 --> 01:53:40.446
You my boy, man.

1910
01:53:40.447 --> 01:53:42.848
No, no, you like
my brother, man.

1911
01:53:42.849 --> 01:53:45.086
So, what am I?

1912
01:53:46.086 --> 01:53:49.086
Oh, man...

1913
01:53:46.086 --> 01:53:48.221
Julie, sweetie, you...

1914
01:53:49.221 --> 01:53:51.389
You're a little dangerous.

1915
01:53:51.390 --> 01:53:56.327
See, you like a magnet
for random gunfire.

1916
01:53:56.328 --> 01:53:58.330
But you're all right.
You're cool.

1917
01:53:58.331 --> 01:53:59.334
You're down.

1918
01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:03.205
So, what's next?

1919
01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:08.574
No, no. See,

1920
01:54:08.575 --> 01:54:11.175
there ain't gonna be no next.

1921
01:54:11.176 --> 01:54:13.745
Whoa, Marcus, Marc...
Come on, man.

1922
01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:15.546
You wanted Mike Lowrey,

1923
01:54:15.547 --> 01:54:17.148
you got him.

1924
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:20.384
Right here.
That's Mike.
Old Mike Lowrey.

1925
01:54:20.385 --> 01:54:24.455
I'm going home to my wife
to get my quality time.

1926
01:54:24.456 --> 01:54:26.157
Marcus, why don't you
stop playing, man?

1927
01:54:26.158 --> 01:54:28.893
I been beat three times
since we been out here.

1928
01:54:28.894 --> 01:54:31.129
I'm cool, man,
I don't need no help.

1929
01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:33.331
Please, back up.
Don't need no help.

1930
01:54:33.332 --> 01:54:35.500
I don't know why you're going
home to your wife.

1931
01:54:35.501 --> 01:54:37.669
You got shot in your leg,
your dick don't work.

1932
01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:40.505
Marcus, do you
have the keys?

1933
01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:43.709
Mike wanted me to go
to this gunfight, then...

1934
01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.580
Well, then
there was this witness...

1935
01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.680
My man!
Oh, I'm sorry.

1936
01:54:49.681 --> 01:54:51.181
My man, let me out of here.

1937
01:54:51.182 --> 01:54:52.483
I don't got the keys.

1938
01:54:52.484 --> 01:54:55.223
What do you mean,
why wouldn't you have keys?

1939
01:54:57.223 --> 01:54:59.691
Marcus, I thought you
said you love me!

1940
01:54:59.692 --> 01:55:01.200
Show me love!
