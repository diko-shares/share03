"I got this, partner, I got this." Bullshit.

840
00:47:31.516 --> 00:47:33.768
I am feeling much better
though. Thank you.

841
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.186
And I'm gonna get his ass.

842
00:47:38.106 --> 00:47:39.733
MARCUS:
Watch yourself.

843
00:47:39.899 --> 00:47:42.652
What did I say?
Did you hear what I said?

844
00:47:42.902 --> 00:47:45.613
I heard what I said because
I was standing there when I said it.

845
00:47:46.281 --> 00:47:49.784
I told you. I told you
to secure a witness...

846
00:47:50.076 --> 00:47:51.911
...not to shoot up a neighborhood.

847
00:47:52.162 --> 00:47:53.288
Not to do another dead body.

848
00:47:53.455 --> 00:47:56.374
Just get the dope back,
and do it quietly.

849
00:47:56.916 --> 00:48:00.462
Look, captain. This whole situation
is getting out of control.

850
00:48:00.712 --> 00:48:03.298
You're goddamn right
it's getting out of control!

851
00:48:03.465 --> 00:48:05.341
Look, man, I damn near
had to pass a pop quiz...

852
00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:06.968
...before she believed I was him.

853
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:09.721
HOWARD:
Going, it's going...

854
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:11.806
Shit, little off.

855
00:48:12.432 --> 00:48:15.268
I haven't killed anybody
yet today, captain.

856
00:48:15.435 --> 00:48:16.644
Do you want me to yell at you?

857
00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:18.688
Because I can do that.
Let me tell you something.

858
00:48:18.855 --> 00:48:20.982
This witness,
it's the only good news I got, okay?

859
00:48:21.149 --> 00:48:22.484
The only good news.

860
00:48:22.692 --> 00:48:24.319
You guys are bad news.

861
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:25.653
So, what does that mean?

862
00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:27.739
That means
if you have to be Mike Lowrey...

863
00:48:27.989 --> 00:48:31.326
...Santa Claus, I don't give a shit,
that's what you're gonna be!

864
00:48:31.576 --> 00:48:34.162
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
What the hell is going on in here?

865
00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:39.084
I was, like, getting them
all in before you showed up.

866
00:48:39.334 --> 00:48:42.337
Can somebody talk to me, please?
Can I know what's going on?

867
00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:47.175
Captain, these fools could have gotten
a look at my license plate last night.

868
00:48:47.342 --> 00:48:49.594
So where's the girl now?

869
00:48:51.471 --> 00:48:53.348
- His place.
- What?

870
00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.143
You left her by herself?
Our only fucking witness?

871
00:48:57.352 --> 00:48:59.437
You left a strange hooker
alone in my apartment?

872
00:48:59.687 --> 00:49:03.149
The girl is not a hooker,
as far as I know.

873
00:49:03.358 --> 00:49:07.487
I had to stash her somewhere.
Her and her dogs, Luke and Dukie.

874
00:49:08.029 --> 00:49:09.322
You left dogs in my house?

875
00:49:09.489 --> 00:49:11.658
So there's dogs
and a hooker in my house?

876
00:49:11.908 --> 00:49:13.493
How about you just add some chimps,
okay?

877
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.204
- We can have a carnival.
- Didn't I just say she wasn't a hooker?

878
00:49:16.371 --> 00:49:18.289
- Can you please...?
HOWARD: Shut up!

879
00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:21.876
For years,
Sinclair has been up my ass...

880
00:49:22.043 --> 00:49:23.378
...trying to pin something on me.

881
00:49:23.545 --> 00:49:26.047
I'm always taking it for you.
Right? Do it for me!

882
00:49:29.509 --> 00:49:32.387
Now, if we get this witness
to ID the shooters...

883
00:49:32.554 --> 00:49:34.180
...maybe we catch our bad guys.

884
00:49:34.389 --> 00:49:36.266
But until then...

885
00:49:36.516 --> 00:49:37.767
...until then...

886
00:49:38.017 --> 00:49:39.269
...you are Mike Lowrey.

887
00:49:39.519 --> 00:49:41.563
You be him, that's what you are.
You're him.

888
00:49:41.813 --> 00:49:45.483
You're him! I don't want to hear it!
You're him. And you! You be you.

889
00:49:45.733 --> 00:49:48.903
But not in front of her!
You're him, you're you!

890
00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:55.743
Can we get a time-out here, cap?

891
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:57.912
What am I,
like, the designated homeless?

892
00:49:58.163 --> 00:49:59.789
Hey. Does it look like I care?

893
00:50:00.248 --> 00:50:02.750
Whatever it takes, all right?
Whatever it takes.

894
00:50:02.917 --> 00:50:04.002
What did she say to you?

895
00:50:04.294 --> 00:50:06.379
The shooters are gonna
make their drop in four days?

896
00:50:06.546 --> 00:50:07.797
So we got four days.

897
00:50:08.423 --> 00:50:11.426
Captain, what kind of plan is that?

898
00:50:11.676 --> 00:50:13.595
I can't be shacked up with that woman.

899
00:50:13.887 --> 00:50:17.307
I have a family to look after.
My wife will kill my ass.

900
00:50:18.057 --> 00:50:20.685
You don't like your job, quit.

901
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:23.938
Damn!

902
00:50:25.899 --> 00:50:28.401
Look, I'll stay at the house
with Theresa and the kids.

903
00:50:28.693 --> 00:50:31.321
Thank you, thank you.
But no, thanks, okay?

904
00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:33.198
You won't last
five minutes with my family.

905
00:50:33.531 --> 00:50:37.327
Please, man. Married life is easy.
You only got one woman to satisfy.

906
00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:40.914
MARCUS:
Yo, man...

907
00:50:41.122 --> 00:50:42.457
...we ain't the Cosbys.

908
00:50:43.124 --> 00:50:45.126
Let's go, I got this.

909
00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:46.419
Go.

910
00:50:48.963 --> 00:50:51.424
Everybody wants to be like Mike.

911
00:50:51.633 --> 00:50:54.469
Yeah, and you're going
to be retired like him too.

912
00:50:54.928 --> 00:50:57.263
I'd have dunked it on your ass.

913
00:50:58.139 --> 00:51:01.434
Cleveland? I have never...

914
00:51:01.601 --> 00:51:04.646
Hey, look, woman, okay?
Now I done told you, okay?

915
00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:06.064
It's a federal subpoena.

916
00:51:06.231 --> 00:51:07.565
What am I gonna do, tell them no?

917
00:51:07.732 --> 00:51:10.276
I don't know what you're gonna
tell them, baby. Why can't he go?

918
00:51:10.485 --> 00:51:11.778
Why can't you go?

919
00:51:11.986 --> 00:51:13.321
Oh, you know, I wanted to...

920
00:51:13.488 --> 00:51:15.907
...but Captain Howard said,
you know, I'm irresponsi...

921
00:51:16.157 --> 00:51:19.077
No, he said, "loose cannon."
Because I be shooting in public.

922
00:51:19.244 --> 00:51:21.371
- Mike.
- Out of nowhere sometimes.

923
00:51:21.621 --> 00:51:22.997
Mike! No, man.

924
00:51:23.456 --> 00:51:24.999
Please. All right.

925
00:51:26.793 --> 00:51:29.921
Look, babe, okay? The neighborhood
has had a lot of break-ins.

926
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:31.839
I can handle it. I don't need Mike.

927
00:51:32.006 --> 00:51:33.341
MARCUS:
I know you can handle it...

928
00:51:33.508 --> 00:51:36.844
...but I'm worrying about me.
Mike's going to stay here.

929
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:39.889
Take care of y'all.
Just till I come back.

930
00:51:40.098 --> 00:51:42.684
THERESA: Who's gonna pick the kids
up from day care and all that stuff?

931
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:43.893
Mike can't do it.

932
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:46.396
Are you listening to me, baby?
I said, Mi...

933
00:51:46.646 --> 00:51:50.441
Hey, I read a book that
could probably help y'all.

934
00:51:50.775 --> 00:51:51.818
Mike, please, man.

935
00:51:51.985 --> 00:51:53.278
Can you go down
and have a Coke and a smile?

936
00:51:53.528 --> 00:51:55.947
- Please.
- All right.

937
00:51:57.657 --> 00:51:59.659
Y'all want something?

938
00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:02.537
Bring me a Coke, Mike.
Baby, you want a Coke?

939
00:52:02.704 --> 00:52:03.913
I'm fine, thank you.

940
00:52:04.163 --> 00:52:07.292
- Mike.
- All right.

941
00:52:12.297 --> 00:52:13.881
So explain it to me, Elliot.

942
00:52:14.924 --> 00:52:16.676
We've got a problem
with our chemistry set?

943
00:52:16.926 --> 00:52:18.428
It's not a chemistry set.

944
00:52:19.012 --> 00:52:21.347
He knows it ain't a chemistry set,
asshole.

945
00:52:26.227 --> 00:52:27.437
So, what is it?

946
00:52:27.687 --> 00:52:30.440
The cutting agent
is a highly volatile...

947
00:52:30.815 --> 00:52:31.858
...substance.

948
00:52:32.358 --> 00:52:33.735
- I don't care.
- The ether...

949
00:52:34.027 --> 00:52:35.737
I don't care! I don't care!

950
00:52:36.029 --> 00:52:39.240
I'm not a fucking
chemistry teacher, Elliot.

951
00:52:39.699 --> 00:52:40.950
So, what is the problem?

952
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.037
The problem is that there's
too much moisture down here.

953
00:52:44.245 --> 00:52:47.040
- Yeah, it's totally fucked.
- You shut up!

954
00:52:48.082 --> 00:52:49.167
Okay.

955
00:52:49.375 --> 00:52:50.501
So, what else?

956
00:52:50.752 --> 00:52:53.421
ELLIOT: It's taking longer to cook
than we originally planned.

957
00:52:53.588 --> 00:52:54.922
And if we rush it...

958
00:52:55.089 --> 00:52:56.632
...we're gonna have a lot
of drugs that we can't sell.

959
00:52:56.924 --> 00:52:58.885
You're fucking with my timetable here.

960
00:52:59.052 --> 00:53:01.054
I gave you a deadline.
You understand?

961
00:53:01.262 --> 00:53:04.015
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

962
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.852
MARCUS:
Julie!

963
00:53:08.019 --> 00:53:09.896
JULIE:
Yeah.

964
00:53:11.564 --> 00:53:12.940
- Oh.
- Oh, um...

965
00:53:13.107 --> 00:53:14.776
- Hi.
- You dressed?

966
00:53:14.984 --> 00:53:17.570
Yeah, I am.

967
00:53:18.112 --> 00:53:20.490
Look,
we gotta go through some mug shots.

968
00:53:20.656 --> 00:53:22.784
So I'm gonna hook into the computer...

969
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:24.410
- ...and we can do this.
- Hey, Mike...

970
00:53:24.577 --> 00:53:26.120
...who's the guy
in all the photographs?

971
00:53:28.915 --> 00:53:31.209
Sometimes
I don't even look at my shelf...

972
00:53:31.376 --> 00:53:33.419
...and I forgot
all the pictures was here.

973
00:53:33.586 --> 00:53:37.507
That's my partner. Yeah, that's
my partner, Marcus Burnett.

974
00:53:38.299 --> 00:53:40.927
I've never seen anything
like this before.

975
00:53:41.135 --> 00:53:43.930
Well, I can see how it
may throw you a little bit.

976
00:53:44.138 --> 00:53:45.640
You know what? It's a cop thing.

977
00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:48.810
Yeah, these pictures are up here
for every time he saved my life.

978
00:53:49.102 --> 00:53:50.436
It's the same thing with him.

979
00:53:50.603 --> 00:53:53.815
You go to his place,
ain't nothing but pictures of me.

980
00:53:53.981 --> 00:53:56.317
Because it's like a
shrine. Just a reminder.

981
00:53:56.609 --> 00:53:57.652
Oh.

982
00:53:57.819 --> 00:54:00.863
Because, I mean, when I saw it,
the whole wall...

983
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:02.657
...I thought maybe they were...

984
00:54:02.824 --> 00:54:04.450
...you know, pictures of your lover.

985
00:54:05.326 --> 00:54:06.327
Of who?

986
00:54:06.619 --> 00:54:08.913
I thought that... You know,
I thought maybe you were gay.

987
00:54:09.622 --> 00:54:10.665
I was gay?

988
00:54:11.416 --> 00:54:13.835
Nah, nah, nah, baby.

989
00:54:14.043 --> 00:54:15.503
I mean, I didn't mean to offend you.

990
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:18.047
You know,
it's okay to be a homosexual, Mike.

991
00:54:18.297 --> 00:54:22.093
No, you're not listening.
It's not registering, okay?

992
00:54:22.343 --> 00:54:26.556
Believe me. Did you sleep in the bed?
You didn't feel the dents?

993
00:54:26.806 --> 00:54:28.433
Yeah, the dents come from all that.

994
00:54:28.683 --> 00:54:31.602
- That's how I gets down.
- Oh, that's...

995
00:54:31.769 --> 00:54:32.812
...sweet.

996
00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:34.647
Gay. Psh.

997
00:54:34.814 --> 00:54:37.191
If I was, I'd change the drapes
in this motherfucker.

998
00:54:39.193 --> 00:54:40.194
JULIE:
No.

999
00:54:45.533 --> 00:54:47.618
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

1000
00:54:47.869 --> 00:54:49.662
I don't eat flesh.

1001
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:51.372
What?

1002
00:54:51.956 --> 00:54:53.875
That's flesh that you're...

1003
00:54:54.167 --> 00:54:55.626
...shoveling into your mouth.

1004
00:54:55.877 --> 00:54:59.213
You know, that was a living,
breathing creature, you know.

1005
00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.715
It probably had a name.

1006
00:55:03.009 --> 00:55:04.469
