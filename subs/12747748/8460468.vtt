Well, I couldn't sleep.

8
00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.792
And it has been such
a hellish year for us as you know,

9
00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:39.125
and I just seem to be working
every day without even realizing it.

10
00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:41.917
And you are just constantly
anxious about your job

11
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.917
because of all the budget cuts.
So, I went online this morning

12
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.125
and I rented us a beautiful house
out by the beach.

13
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.833
And it was such a steal
even though it's barely the off-season.

19
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.875
I figured if I made the reservation
and packed our bags,

20
00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.878
it would eliminate
most of the reasons to say no.

21
00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:12.309

there for you from the website.

so I haven't packed for them yet.

24

super psyched about this.

25
00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:26.042

31
00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:48.625

starting their day

32

33

36

I felt so lucky to be a part of that.

37
00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:06.250
But then, I remembered...

38
00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.333
...what the world is actually like.

39
00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:14.000

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.208
I got another idea for a good time. Hm?

171
00:10:21.042 --> 00:10:22.042
M-Maybe?

172
00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.208
[sighs]

173
00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:29.298
[Amanda] We've got 15 minutes
before they're begging to go to the beach.

174
00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:30.875
That's all I need.

175
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
[eerie music playing]

176
00:10:59.875 --> 00:11:01.875
[seagulls crying]

177
00:11:20.167 --> 00:11:21.250
Sunblock? Sunblock?

178
00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:22.333
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Yeah.

179
00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:26.458
We practically have
the beach to ourselves.

180
00:11:28.542 --> 00:11:29.750
[satisfied exhale]

181
00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:42.333
[young woman] The undertow's horrible...

182
00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:52.625
[girl] Look at that boat.

183
00:11:56.417 --> 00:11:57.417
It's so big.

184
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.750
[phone buzzing]

185
00:12:19.042 --> 00:12:19.875
{\an8}[phone buzzes]

186
00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.208
{\an8}Hey, Mom, Taylor just dropped a pin.

187
00:12:22.292 --> 00:12:24.772
Can you, uh, can you look at that
and see how far her house is?

188
00:12:25.792 --> 00:12:28.417
Just look. Y-You said
maybe we could drive over there.

189
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.125
- Right? So, maybe?
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.851
All right, that's Sag Harbor.
That's at least an hour away, honey.

191
00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:34.875
It's getting closer.

192
00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:36.958
- What is?
- The ship.

193
00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:41.292
Oh, yeah. She's a beaut.
Looks like an oil tanker.

194
00:12:42.542 --> 00:12:43.667
Must be a port around here.

195
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.083
I read this piece in <i>The Atlantic</i>

196
00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:48.583
that says New York has one of the largest
natural harbors on the planet.

197
00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:54.917
[eerie music continues]

198
00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:13.667
You okay, Rose?

199
00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:16.167
I think that ship is heading towards us.

200
00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:18.042
What was that, sweetie?

201
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.500
[rumbling]

202
00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:27.333
[beachgoers murmuring]

203
00:13:27.917 --> 00:13:29.792
- Clay?
- Hmm?

204
00:13:31.375 --> 00:13:32.375
- Clay.
- Yeah.

205
00:13:37.208 --> 00:13:39.625
Wow. It's getting close, huh?

206
00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:42.500
You think that's a problem?

207
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.750
Nah, come on.
It's gonna stop. It's got to.

208
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.500
Right?

209
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:57.458
Wake up. Archie, come on, bud.
Help us pack up.

210
00:13:57.542 --> 00:13:59.458
Leaving already? Why?

211
00:13:59.542 --> 00:14:01.208
- [boat rumbling]
- Holy fuck.

212
00:14:01.292 --> 00:14:02.625
Jesus, Archie, let's go.

213
00:14:05.542 --> 00:14:07.625
- Let's go! Go, go, go!

[rumbling stops]

218

Come on, keep it moving.
Keep it moving, guys.

219
00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.750
Excuse me, officer.
Do you know what happened?

220
00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.684
There's been a handful
of these groundings up the coast,

221
00:15:02.708 --> 00:15:05.788
something to do with the nav system.
Sorry guys, I need you to keep it moving.

222
00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.042
Keep it moving, guys.

223
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.750
[man yelling]

224
00:15:21.792 --> 00:15:22.917
There's a Starbucks.

225
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.083
Oh.

226
00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:29.809
I wanted to read up on what happened
at the beach but the Wi-Fi isn't working.

227
00:15:29.833 --> 00:15:31.500
You think the router needs a reset?

228
00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:35.042
Well, sorry, I can't help you there.
You are the tech wiz, not I.

229
00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:37.375
You know, the TV's out too.

230
00:15:37.458 --> 00:15:39.833
I tried to check the game
but there's no signal.

231
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.684
You still gonna be down
for burgers tonight?

232
00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:44.375
Yeah, I could be down for that.

233
00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:47.583
[sighs]

234
00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:51.083
Meanwhile, the kids seem
to have completely gotten over it

235
00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:53.125
like it was something they saw on a show.

236
00:15:53.208 --> 00:15:55.000
They're on to the next episode.

237
00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:02.083
[whispering] Clay.

238
00:16:03.333 --> 00:16:04.333
Come here, look.

239
00:16:08.417 --> 00:16:10.083
[whispering] Oh, wow.

240
00:16:12.333 --> 00:16:15.250
That's a good omen. Seeing deer.

241
00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:16.875
Hmm.

242
00:16:16.917 --> 00:16:19.375
At least according to
Mesoamerican mythology.

243
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.667
You gonna help? Hmm?

244
00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:32.042
Uh, wha... Yes. Yes, I'm here to help.

Uh-oh.

- [gasps]

- [Clay] Don't, don't do it that way.
- [Amanda] No, no, no, no, no. Well...

252
00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:25.768
- Don't, don't go in the middle.
- No, I'm gonna go in the middle.

253
00:17:25.792 --> 00:17:29.792
Because it'll make it harder for you.
And isn't that the point of my life?

254
00:17:31.542 --> 00:17:33.542
[gasps, chuckles breathlessly]

255
00:17:36.625 --> 00:17:37.833
[sharp exhale]

256
00:17:37.917 --> 00:17:39.667
You getting some more?
Would you top me up?

257
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:40.917
Uh-huh.

258
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.458
Sure, but I think I'm donezo.
I need a glass of water,

259
00:17:44.542 --> 00:17:47.000
or I'm going to have
a motherfucker of a hangover tomorrow.

260
00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:52.000
Hey, you remember that student of mine
who was published last year? Maria Miller?

261
00:17:52.833 --> 00:17:56.792
Well, she wants me to write
the foreword to her second book.

262
00:17:57.625 --> 00:18:00.750
I mean, you know, she says
I'm some kind of huge inspiration.

263
00:18:00.833 --> 00:18:03.000
I never know if I'm even
getting through to these kids

264
00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:04.434
- and then something like this happens...
- [thud]

265
00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:05.750
Shh!

266
00:18:08.167 --> 00:18:10.208
- Did you hear that?
- Mm-mm.

267
00:18:10.292 --> 00:18:13.167
Her second book is like an exploration

268
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:17.292
of how media serves as
both an escape and a reflection.

269
00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:18.750
Which is a contradiction

270
00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:20.917
- that she manages to reconcile.
- [thud]

271
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.120
[whispering] Someone's here.

272
00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:24.708
Get a bat.

273
00:18:25.708 --> 00:18:27.125
- A bat?
- Yeah.

274
00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:29.125
Why would I have a bat?

275
00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:31.208

276
00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:38.083

00:18:40.542 --> 00:18:42.792
I'm sure it's nothing.
Let me take care of it.

279
00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.635
Actually, you know what?
Get your cell phone.

280
00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:49.000
Just, you know, just in case.

281
00:18:54.583 --> 00:18:56.083
I'm so sorry to bother you.

282
00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:58.125
Hello. Hi.

283
00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:02.042
- I'm so sorry to bother you.
- In case you didn't know. [chuckles]

284
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.292
[chuckles] Well, can I help you?

285
00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:08.792
I know it's late.
A knock at the door, way out here.

286
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.542
Couldn't decide if we should knock
at the front door or the side door,

287
00:19:12.625 --> 00:19:14.250
and this went on for some time.

288
00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:16.833
I thought we should try the side door
because it has glass

289
00:19:16.917 --> 00:19:19.500
and you'd have seen us
and known we're just...

290
00:19:20.667 --> 00:19:22.000
You must be Amanda.

291
00:19:23.417 --> 00:19:25.000
A-Amanda Sandford, right?

292
00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.958
You, you two know each other?

293
00:19:29.042 --> 00:19:31.292
No, we have not had the pleasure
of meeting face-to-face.

294
00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:33.333
I'm-I'm G.H. G.H. Scott.

295
00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:38.250
George. He's George.
That's how it reads in his email.

296
00:19:38.333 --> 00:19:41.375
Oh. [chuckles] Forgive me. I forgot.

297
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.333
See, this is why I much preferred life
before the internet,

298
00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:48.125
because we would have spoken on the phone,
you would have recognized my voice

299
00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:49.708
and known that this is our house.

300
00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:53.708
I'm sorry?

301
00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:58.375
This is our house. I'm the George
you emailed back and forth with.

302
00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:01.667
No, I-I remember the name, I just...

303
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.833
This is... this is <i>your</i> house?

304
00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:11.333
Mm.

305
00:20:11.417 --> 00:20:13.542
I'm sorry. You think we could come inside?

306
00:20:13.625 --> 00:20:16.167
Oh, yeah. Hey, sure.
Y-Yeah, come, come on in.

307
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.250
Yeah. Got cold out all of a sudden.

308
00:20:22.917 --> 00:20:24.750
I understand how strange
this must be for you.

309
00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:27.333
Us, turning up like this unannounced.

310
00:20:28.167 --> 00:20:31.500
We would have called, you see,
but, uh... the phones are out.

311
00:20:32.292 --> 00:20:34.833
Yeah, my phone doesn't
seem to have service.

312
00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:37.500
It's almost as if we're telling the truth.

313
00:20:39.125 --> 00:20:40.500
[Clay] Uh...

314
00:20:40.583 --> 00:20:42.708
[chuckles] Hey. I'm Clay.

315
00:20:42.792 --> 00:20:43.917
- Ruth.
- Hi.

316
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.458
- And I'm G.H., again.
- G.H.

317
00:20:45.542 --> 00:20:46.822
- Clay, nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

318
00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:50.333
Why don't we... sit down?

319
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:51.792
And you know, talk.

320
00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:53.375
The children are sleeping.

321
00:20:53.458 --> 00:20:55.167
I wouldn't worry too much about them.

322
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.601
I mean, Archie'd sleep
through the atom bomb.

323
00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:59.208
You know? [laughs]
Let's go in the kitchen.

324
00:21:04.375 --> 00:21:08.708
[G.H.] Tonight we were at the symphony
in the Bronx. Have you been?

325
00:21:09.708 --> 00:21:11.292
[Clay] Uh... No.

326
00:21:11.375 --> 00:21:13.309
[G.H.] Their productions
are in a class of their own.

327
00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:15.542
[Ruth] He's on the board
of the Philharmonic.

328
00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:18.875
He likes to encourage everyone he knows
to take an interest in classical music.

329
00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:21.875
So in other words,
I am one lucky daughter.

330
00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.583
[Clay and G.H. chuckle]

331
00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.333
Do you mind if I get a glass of water?

332
00:21:26.917 --> 00:21:29.167
Uh, no, no. Uh, help yourself.

333
00:21:30.083 --> 00:21:33.542
[G.H.] Anyway, we were driving
back to the city, home.

334
00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:35.667
And then something happened.

335
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.250
A blackout.

336
00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:39.125
- A blackout?
- [G.H.] Mm.

337
00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:41.583
The lights seem,
seem to be working pretty good.

338
00:21:42.542 --> 00:21:43.542
Um...

339
00:21:44.125 --> 00:21:47.667
Exactly, right, so, um... we thought...

340
00:21:49.667 --> 00:21:53.042
Well, with everything that's probably
going on in the city right now,

341
00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:54.125
we didn't...

342
00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:57.542
We live on the 14th floor and he can't
climb 14 flights because of his knee.

343
00:21:58.417 --> 00:21:59.726
Plus the traffic lights went out.

344
00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.630
We would have been sitting in a six hour
parking lot if we'd headed home.

345
00:22:03.083 --> 00:22:07.208
So there was a blackout and you decided
to drive all the way out here?

346
00:22:07.292 --> 00:22:10.792
These roads, they're familiar.
I barely even thought about it.

347
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.875
So when we saw the lights go,
I looked at Ruth...

348
00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.167
And said that he would feel better
if we stayed here.

349
00:22:16.917 --> 00:22:20.292
You know, in his house.
[slurps]

350
00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:25.542
Wait. Y-You, you want to stay here?
But... we're staying here.

351
00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:28.917
Well, under the circumstances,
we, we thought you might understand.

352
00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:34.833
- Of course. Yeah. It's just...
- Uh...

353
00:22:34.917 --> 00:22:39.083
I think what he means is,
of course we understand...

354
00:22:39.167 --> 00:22:41.875
I know it's a surprise,
but we thought maybe if you let us stay...

355
00:22:41.958 --> 00:22:42.958
Because, again...

356
00:22:44.208 --> 00:22:46.875
You know, it is like...

357
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.667
- our house.
- [awkward chuckle]

358
00:22:50.875 --> 00:22:54.208
What she's trying to say is
we wanted to be somewhere safe.

359
00:22:54.792 --> 00:22:57.375
Well, you know, we're, we're on vacation.

360
00:22:57.458 --> 00:23:00.375
Clay, Amanda, we could absolutely
refund you your money.

361
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.833
You want us to leave?

362
00:23:02.917 --> 00:23:05.833
I-It's the middle of the night.
My, my children are sleeping upstairs.

363
00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:07.851
You come in here
and talk about refunding our money.

364
00:23:07.875 --> 00:23:10.875
I-I think I need to call the company.
I don't even think you can do this.

365
00:23:10.958 --> 00:23:12.643
Um, there's got to be
a number on their web...

366
00:23:12.667 --> 00:23:14.583
Th-That's really not necessary.

367
00:23:14.667 --> 00:23:15.500
Why not?

368
00:23:15.583 --> 00:23:18.542
Because we're not saying you should leave.

369
00:23:18.625 --> 00:23:22.708
We could refund you,
say, 50% of what you paid.

370
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.110
You know, there's an in-law suite.
We could stay downstairs.

371
00:23:26.167 --> 00:23:27.000
Downstairs?

372
00:23:27.083 --> 00:23:27.917
Fifty percent?

373
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.833
I think we need to look at
the terms and conditions here. Uh...

374
00:23:30.917 --> 00:23:33.250
A-All right, we need to find
the, the Wi-Fi router.

375
00:23:33.333 --> 00:23:35.268
- Okay, I'll try tethering it to my cell.
- It needs to be reset.

376
00:23:35.292 --> 00:23:37.212
All right, well, the phones
aren't working, Clay.

377
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.601
How's that supposed to make a difference?

378
00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:40.792
I think the internet is down anyway, so...

379
00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:43.417
Okay, look. I'm... [sighs] I'm sorry.

380
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.958
I just, uh, I don't feel comfortable
staying in a house with...

381
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.417
...people I don't know.

382
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.667
Uh, it's a blackout.
I-It could be over in a couple of hours.

383
00:23:55.917 --> 00:23:56.917
May I?

384
00:24:14.375 --> 00:24:17.083
I should have listened to my wife
and had these labeled already.

385
00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:21.958
[softly] Yeah...

386
00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:27.625
[chuckles]

387
00:24:30.875 --> 00:24:32.792
Ah... Here we are.

388
00:24:33.542 --> 00:24:34.542
[grunts]

389
00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:53.167
Yeah... I can give you
a thousand dollars now for the night.

390
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.375
That should cover almost half
of what you're paying for the weekend.

391
00:24:57.875 --> 00:24:59.167
It's a thousand dollars.

392
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.792
We'll be very grateful.

393
00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:02.917
Then tomorrow, we'll know
a little more and...

394
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.101
- ...we'll figure this all out.
- Yeah.

395
00:25:04.125 --> 00:25:07.125
Meanwhile this thing is not responding.

396
00:25:07.208 --> 00:25:10.583
So anyway, I say one night, it's like...

397
00:25:10.667 --> 00:25:12.708
I think we should discuss this privately.

398
00:25:15.708 --> 00:25:17.434
You know, we're gonna go talk
in the other room, all right?

399
00:25:17.458 --> 00:25:18.500
Hmm.

400
00:25:20.167 --> 00:25:23.708
- Say, you mind if I made myself a drink?
- Oh, sure. Make yourself right at... Um.

401
00:25:25.083 --> 00:25:26.083
Yep.

402
00:25:27.208 --> 00:25:29.018
[Amanda] Why did, why did you tell them
they could stay?

403
00:25:29.042 --> 00:25:30.583
[Clay] I mean, it's a blackout.

404
00:25:30.667 --> 00:25:32.333
What, you, y-you think they're lying?

405
00:25:32.417 --> 00:25:35.137
I mean, it's a young woman and her father,
they look innocent enough.

406
00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:36.000
They're strangers.

407
00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:37.542
They introduced themselves.

408
00:25:37.625 --> 00:25:39.708
They knocked on the door
in the middle of the night.

409
00:25:39.792 --> 00:25:41.375
Would you rather them burst in?

410
00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:42.698
They scared the shit out of me.

411
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.583
Well, I think, you know,
that they were scared too.

412
00:25:45.667 --> 00:25:48.042
Right? I mean,
they didn't know what else to do.

413
00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:50.125
Well, here's an idea: go to a hotel.

414
00:25:50.208 --> 00:25:53.458
This is their home as, you know,
the girl kept reminding us.

415
00:25:53.542 --> 00:25:57.208
Well, we didn't ask for any proof.
I didn't hear their car. Did you?

416
00:25:57.292 --> 00:25:59.458
No, but it's windy.
Maybe we just didn't hear it.

417
00:25:59.542 --> 00:26:00.917
Or maybe they snuck up the road.

418
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.417
Or, maybe we should calm down a little?

419
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.625
I'm sorry. I just...

420
00:26:05.708 --> 00:26:08.208
This really doesn't seem like their house.

421
00:26:08.292 --> 00:26:10.125
The board of the Philharmonic?

422
00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:13.667
I don't know.
It just all feels like a con to me.

423
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.917
They want to stay here? With us?

424
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.083
Forget it. I wouldn't be able to sleep
with strangers in the house.

425
00:26:19.583 --> 00:26:23.208
Rose is right down the hall.
What if he sneaks in...

426
00:26:23.292 --> 00:26:24.434
I don't want to think about it.

427
00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:26.917
You don't think
he'd want to molest Archie, though.

428
00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:29.500
What are you talking about?

429
00:26:29.583 --> 00:26:33.125
I'm just saying I don't like
the way any of this sounds. Okay?

430
00:26:33.208 --> 00:26:36.167
He came here because he doesn't want
to climb a flight of fucking stairs?

431
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.417
Give me a break.
All feels a little improvised.

432
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.292
God, what if it's a scam?

433
00:26:42.792 --> 00:26:45.625
[stammering] What if the blackout
and whatever

434
00:26:45.708 --> 00:26:47.333
that's just all part of the story?

435
00:26:47.417 --> 00:26:48.750
I don't think they made that up.

436
00:26:48.833 --> 00:26:51.476
I mean, that's probably why the phones
and the internet aren't working.

437
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.917
And besides, hey. He had the keys.

438
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.125
He opened up the liquor cabinet. Remember?

439
00:26:56.208 --> 00:26:57.625
So what if he had the keys?

440
00:26:57.708 --> 00:27:01.167
Maybe he's the handyman.
She's the housekeeper.

441
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.958
The housekeeper always knows
where the stash of money is.

442
00:27:04.042 --> 00:27:06.750
And besides, he had his back to us.
Maybe he broke into it.

443
00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:10.000
I don't see what he has to gain
by giving us a thousand bucks.

444
00:27:10.083 --> 00:27:15.000
Why are you trying so hard to believe
everyone except your own wife?

445
00:27:15.083 --> 00:27:17.875
Something is happening
and I don't trust them.

446
00:27:17.958 --> 00:27:22.750
I think they are scared, nice people
who need a place to spend the night.

447
00:27:23.542 --> 00:27:26.500
All right, I'm going to go down there
and I'm going to talk to them,

448
00:27:26.583 --> 00:27:30.167
and if I get a bad vibe,
I-I'm going to say, "No.

449
00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.917
We're not comfortable
with this arrangement."

450
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.042
Okay? But if things are cool,
I say we let them stay.

451
00:27:37.542 --> 00:27:39.167
I wish I had your faith in people.

452
00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:53.542
My own signature cocktail.
Happy to make you one.

453
00:27:54.167 --> 00:27:55.647
Yeah, you know, I might have a drink.

454
00:27:56.375 --> 00:27:57.976
Haven't touched
this one yet, it's all yours.

455
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.125
Oh, thank you.

456
00:28:02.667 --> 00:28:03.667
How about you, Amanda?

457
00:28:04.958 --> 00:28:06.208
What's in it, exactly?

458
00:28:06.292 --> 00:28:08.083
[Clay exclaims in delight]

459
00:28:08.167 --> 00:28:09.167
[laughs]

460
00:28:09.208 --> 00:28:10.958
That is a heck of a cocktail.

461
00:28:11.042 --> 00:28:12.922
You should try this, babe.
I think you'd dig it.

462
00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:14.875
I'll pass.

463
00:28:15.458 --> 00:28:16.708
[slam]

464
00:28:17.875 --> 00:28:19.458
I think I need some fresh air.

465
00:28:28.458 --> 00:28:29.708
Um...

466
00:28:31.625 --> 00:28:32.917
You have a beautiful home.

467
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.667
We love it. Glad to hear you do, too.

468
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.125
- [liquid pours]
- How long have you been here?

469
00:28:38.208 --> 00:28:39.792
Oh... Bought it almost...

470
00:28:40.708 --> 00:28:41.958
...twenty years ago now.

471
00:28:42.042 --> 00:28:44.083
But, at this point, it's... it's home.

472
00:28:44.167 --> 00:28:46.583
Or a home away from home.

473
00:28:46.667 --> 00:28:50.417
We fixed it up about five years back.
We had a great contractor.

474
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.625
- A lot of little details were his idea.
- Hmm.

475
00:28:52.708 --> 00:28:55.042
Whereabouts is your place in the city?

476
00:28:55.125 --> 00:28:57.833
We are on Park between 81st and 82nd.

477
00:28:58.542 --> 00:28:59.417
What about you?

478
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.708
Uh, Brooklyn. Sunset Park.

479
00:29:01.792 --> 00:29:03.500
Well, it's actually Park Slope.

480
00:29:03.583 --> 00:29:05.583
- Ah, very nice.
- Mm-hmm.

481
00:29:05.667 --> 00:29:08.500
That's where everyone
wants to live these days. Affordable, too.

482
00:29:09.542 --> 00:29:11.958
I think even Ruth looked over there

483
00:29:12.042 --> 00:29:13.792
when she was thinking
about flying the coop.

484
00:29:14.375 --> 00:29:18.042
Where's your wife? I'm curious if you're
worried about her in the city.

485
00:29:19.292 --> 00:29:21.625
She's on a work trip in Morocco.

486
00:29:22.333 --> 00:29:24.417
She's an art dealer so she travels a lot.

487
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.625
Her flight is due back here
in the morning, actually.

488
00:29:26.708 --> 00:29:27.708
Uh-huh.

489
00:29:28.625 --> 00:29:29.958
Could I see your ID?

490
00:29:30.042 --> 00:29:30.917
Oh, Amanda.

491
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.333
It's a fair ask.

492
00:29:32.417 --> 00:29:34.625
You're a stranger showing up
in the middle of the night

493
00:29:34.708 --> 00:29:36.208
and my kids are upstairs.

494
00:29:36.292 --> 00:29:38.167
Of course. I understand.

495
00:29:45.708 --> 00:29:47.667
Mm, well. [chuckles]

496
00:29:48.208 --> 00:29:50.500
You're not going to believe this but I...

497
00:29:51.417 --> 00:29:55.375
left my wallet in my coat pocket,
which I checked at the symphony.

498
00:29:55.458 --> 00:29:57.833
In all the commotion,
I must have forgotten it there.

499
00:29:58.875 --> 00:30:02.583
You said you heard about the blackout
while you were on your way home.

500
00:30:03.208 --> 00:30:04.917
- [emergency alert blares]
- [Amanda gasps]

501
00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:12.583
[automated voice]
<i>This is a national emergency.</i>

502
00:30:12.667 --> 00:30:17.333
<i>All radio stations and televisions will
cease their programs during this alert.</i>

503
00:30:17.417 --> 00:30:18.657
<i>This is a national emergency...</i>

504
00:30:18.708 --> 00:30:22.167
Well. Looks like you did the right thing
getting out of the city.

about a blackout here.

- A blackout is not nothing.
- [channels switching, alert continuing]

508
00:30:31.125 --> 00:30:34.958
It could be something. The symptom
of something bigger, like terrorism

509
00:30:35.042 --> 00:30:38.417
or a bomb like the one that you said
your son would sleep through.

Their laundry?

I'll take the floor. You take the bed.

521
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.292
We need to get them out of here.

522
00:31:36.292 --> 00:31:38.208
We're not going to do that
by scaring them.

523
00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:42.083
They need to think
everything's going to be okay.

524

Everything is going to be okay, isn't it?

Your client didn't tell you
anything else, did he?

528
00:32:04.917 --> 00:32:07.500
There's no point in talking about this
until we know more.

Don't take it so personal.

I don't think I can listen to
much more of that snark.

to be their house.

Are we still on that?

541
00:32:52.042 --> 00:32:54.792
Well, there is not one photo on the wall.

542
00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:58.583
Not a wedding picture of the supposed
art dealer wife on the business trip

543
00:32:58.667 --> 00:33:00.833
or that spoiled brat as a baby.
Think about it.

I'm sure they take them down when
they rent the house for privacy concerns.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.042
It was an oil tanker.

549
00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:19.875
Well, why didn't you? Tell them, I mean.

00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:25.500
I don't know.
Just seemed like it was piling on.

Why didn't you?

I was afraid.

00:33:32.375 --> 00:33:33.500
Afraid of what?

569
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:38.958
Mom, two problems. One: I was literally
about to start the <i>Friends</i> series finale,

570
00:34:39.042 --> 00:34:41.750
but the internet on my iPad
still isn't working.

571
00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:45.417
I tried to watch it on the TV
because I read somewhere that they...

572
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.300
What's it called when they used to play
old things over and over again?

573
00:34:50.625 --> 00:34:51.625
Reruns.

574
00:34:52.375 --> 00:34:53.542
Why do they do that again?

575
00:34:54.375 --> 00:34:56.750
I don't know, Rosie.
We were really bored back then.

576
00:34:57.667 --> 00:35:00.792
Anyway, th-there's something wrong
with the TV. It's all messed up.

577
00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:03.667
That's problem number two.
Please fix this.

578
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:06.792
I have incredible anxiety about
how they're going to wrap up the show.

579
00:35:06.875 --> 00:35:09.333
Don't you think you're taking this
a little too seriously?

00:35:09.417 --> 00:35:12.000
This isn't fair. It's a vacation.

581
00:35:12.083 --> 00:35:15.250
Dad said on vacation we can have
as much screen time as we want.

582
00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:18.708
Well. A: <i>I</i> did not say that.

Yes, of course I'm sure.

Uh, two about the blackout
and one that said, um...

593
00:36:14.542 --> 00:36:16.375
hackers were behind
the power outage.

00:36:16.458 --> 00:36:18.125
- Hackers?
- Yeah.

595
00:36:18.208 --> 00:36:21.833
And then there was one that said, uh,
"breaking" but then it was just gibberish.

596
00:36:21.917 --> 00:36:23.917
No words, just random letters.

597
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.500

- What?

00:37:51.375 --> 00:37:52.542
Yeah, see?

627
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:56.458
No. It's just-it's not working.

628
00:37:56.542 --> 00:37:58.958
I'm aware. Can you like,
reboot it or something?

629
00:37:59.042 --> 00:38:02.125
- Or go up on the roof or whatever?
- No one's going on the roof.

630
00:38:02.208 --> 00:38:04.375
I am definitely not going up on the roof.

631
00:38:04.458 --> 00:38:06.792
Okay? But I'm going
to go to the store later

632
00:38:06.875 --> 00:38:09.375
and maybe I can find something
that will, you know, help.

633
00:38:09.458 --> 00:38:12.167
You know, get one of those, uh,
some rabbit ears or something.

634
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.000

on my phone this morning.

- Your phone is working?
- No.

645
00:39:59.417 --> 00:40:03.083
They must have come in overnight somehow,
and then they disappeared.

646
00:40:04.458 --> 00:40:05.458
What did they say?

647
00:40:06.667 --> 00:40:10.750
There were two about the blackout and then
something about hackers being behind it.

648
00:40:10.833 --> 00:40:11.833

- Mm-hmm.

in New York City?

Or-Or near the river?

Why are you asking about power plants?

652
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:20.833
Hackers can get into power plants.

653
00:40:20.917 --> 00:40:22.750
That's probably how
they caused the outage.

654
00:40:22.833 --> 00:40:25.101
You remember that thing
that happened in Jersey a few years back?

655
00:40:25.125 --> 00:40:26.667
It nearly caused a meltdown.

656
00:40:29.583 --> 00:40:31.250

658
00:40:36.375 --> 00:40:37.958
Thirteen, last month.

659
00:40:38.042 --> 00:40:39.250
Hmm.

660
00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:41.083
Still kind of a baby at heart.

661
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.750
If it's okay with you, I would like to
keep what's going on between the adults.

662
00:40:46.833 --> 00:40:48.167
The kids like the pool.

663
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.125
I'm just going to encourage them
to do that until we know more.

664
00:40:51.208 --> 00:40:53.000
I don't want them to panic over nothing.

665

but I disagree with you.

Disagree with me about what?

667
00:40:59.583 --> 00:41:01.375
I don't think this is nothing.

668
00:41:07.167 --> 00:41:09.875
So, what is it that you do?

Me, I'm... [chuckles]

679
00:41:39.833 --> 00:41:42.875
I'm still figuring my shit out,
trying not to rush into anything.

680
00:41:42.958 --> 00:41:45.708
The last thing that I want
is to be sucked into a career

681
00:41:45.792 --> 00:41:47.059
that I regret ten years from now

682
00:41:47.083 --> 00:41:50.000
by which point I will be trapped
by the pressure to stay the course

683
00:41:50.083 --> 00:41:52.923
because I'll be too old to re-enter
the workforce. You know what I mean.

684
00:41:53.333 --> 00:41:55.792
Morning. Any news?

685
00:41:58.083 --> 00:41:59.833
Phone's still not working.

686
00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:02.417

687
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.500
He went to the store to get a newspaper.

688

Or try to find someone to talk to,
to see if they know what's going on.

689
00:42:08.625 --> 00:42:12.500
Smart. I thought I'd go over
to our neighbors house, the Huxleys.

690
00:42:13.083 --> 00:42:16.125
- They only live a few miles down the road.
- And you think they'll be home?

691
00:42:16.208 --> 00:42:17.667
Unlikely.

692
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:19.750
You often see no one here
around this time,

693
00:42:19.833 --> 00:42:21.417
but I'll drive over anyway and check.

694
00:42:22.167 --> 00:42:25.083
Before you go, you might
want to hear about the alerts.

695
00:42:27.167 --> 00:42:28.333

696
00:42:28.417 --> 00:42:32.042
Oh, I had news alerts
on my phone this morning.

697
00:42:32.125 --> 00:42:34.292
Two of them were about the blackout

698
00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:38.958
but then there was one that said something
about maybe hackers were behind it.

699
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Uh-huh.

700
00:42:42.083 --> 00:42:45.000
What? Do you think
there's going to be a meltdown, too?

702
00:42:46.417 --> 00:42:49.542
- Is that what Ruth told you?
- Among other horrifying things, yes.

703
00:42:49.625 --> 00:42:52.542
Well, obviously
Ruth is being a little paranoid.

704
00:42:52.625 --> 00:42:54.250
Aren't you the one who always said,

705
00:42:54.333 --> 00:42:57.125
"If you're not paranoid by now,
it's probably too late"?

706
00:42:59.792 --> 00:43:02.375
I'm sure this'll
turn out to be a big nothing.

I-I'm sorry. What's a Love You bug?

710
00:43:12.917 --> 00:43:14.750
Um, it was a computer worm.

711
00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:17.333
Spread throughout
the internet back in 2000.

712
00:43:17.417 --> 00:43:20.417
People would get an email with
the subject line that read "I love you."

You clicked on the attachment,
it would send it to all your contacts.

714

It crippled businesses
and caused billions of dollars in damages.

715
00:43:27.167 --> 00:43:30.000
Turns out, it was just
two teenagers in the Philippines.

Sure.

722

to some airport in Ohio.

00:59:32.083 --> 00:59:33.292
[under breath] Fuck...

854
00:59:39.875 --> 00:59:40.875
Archie.

855
00:59:43.083 --> 00:59:44.292
Archie, look.

856
00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:49.000
Will you please look?

857
00:59:52.458 --> 00:59:53.458
[Archie] What?

858
00:59:56.208 --> 00:59:57.292
We should go up there.

859
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.667
No. No, fuck that. I'm hungry.
Come on, let's go.

860
01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:09.333
[geese honking in distance]

861
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.375
Rose, let's go.

862
01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:25.375
So...

863
01:00:26.292 --> 01:00:28.167
You going to tell us
why you're soaking wet?

864
01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:33.792
I fell into the pool.

865
01:00:34.917 --> 01:00:37.375
You fell into the... pool.

866
01:00:38.042 --> 01:00:39.625
I tripped over something.

867
01:00:39.708 --> 01:00:41.458
Yeah, I fell into the pool.

868
01:00:41.542 --> 01:00:44.184
What were you doing near the pool?
I thought you were looking for Rich.

869
01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:46.875
Do you mind going to my study
and getting me something to wear?

870
01:00:47.625 --> 01:00:50.458
I'm afraid this is the only
change of clothes I had downstairs.

871
01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:02.792
I saw it, you know?

872
01:01:04.667 --> 01:01:06.458
A while ago, before all this happened.

873
01:01:08.792 --> 01:01:10.167
I looked at the market.

874
01:01:11.375 --> 01:01:13.208
And I knew something was coming.

875
01:01:16.083 --> 01:01:17.083
What do you mean?

876
01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:25.333
In my line of work, you have to understand
the patterns that govern the world.

877
01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:28.167
You have to learn how to read the curve.

878
01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:32.375
Spend as long as I have doing it,
it can help you see the future.

879
01:01:32.458 --> 01:01:35.875
It holds steady, it promises harmony.

880
01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:38.958
It inches up or down,
you know that means something.

881
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.500
G.H., why-why are you telling me this?

882
01:01:48.458 --> 01:01:50.250
Did your neighbor say something to you?

883
01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:52.792
No, he wasn't home.

884
01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.625
But he has a satellite phone
I thought could help us.

885
01:01:56.458 --> 01:02:00.333
I tried to use it. It didn't work
even though it had enough juice.

886
01:02:01.167 --> 01:02:04.125
Now, the whole point of a satellite phone
is that you always have a signal

887
01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:06.542
if you have a clear view of the sky,
which I did.

888
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:10.208
Only reason why it wouldn't work

889
01:02:10.292 --> 01:02:12.583
is if our satellites
got knocked out of commission.

890
01:02:15.667 --> 01:02:16.708
Our satellites.

891
01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:22.625
You think something happened
to our satellites. The ones in space.

892
01:02:22.708 --> 01:02:25.333
Satellites are networked
to computers down here.

893
01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.750
Mm...

894
01:02:29.708 --> 01:02:34.792
So you think that the hackers or whatever
knocked out our satellites?

895
01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:38.833
Don't you think you're maybe
getting a little carried away?

896
01:02:38.917 --> 01:02:40.393
I mean, maybe you just
didn't use the phone right.

897
01:02:40.417 --> 01:02:43.708
I saw a plane nosedive
out of the sky into the ocean.

898
01:02:50.292 --> 01:02:51.583
And it wasn't the first.

899
01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:05.167
I no longer think that this is just
a couple of teenagers in the Philippines.

900
01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:14.000
[rumbling]

901
01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:15.000
What the fuck?

902
01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:16.875
[distant explosion]

903
01:03:16.958 --> 01:03:18.250
What the fuck?

904
01:03:18.958 --> 01:03:20.833
[explosions continue]

905
01:03:20.917 --> 01:03:22.917
[rumbling]

906
01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:27.583
Where are my kids?

907
01:03:27.667 --> 01:03:31.125
[shrill electronic tone screeching]

908
01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:34.833
[gasps lightly]

909
01:03:34.917 --> 01:03:36.833
[tone continues]

910
01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.833
[thunder rumbling]

911
01:04:26.167 --> 01:04:28.167
[muffled booming]

912
01:04:32.875 --> 01:04:34.875
[whimpering]

913
01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:37.542
[muffled scream]

914
01:04:43.167 --> 01:04:45.167
[shrill tone fades]

915
01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:00.667
[Rose] Mommy.

916
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.500
Where's Dad?

917
01:05:09.042 --> 01:05:10.042
He'll be back soon.

918
01:05:11.792 --> 01:05:12.792
Why are you wet?

919
01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:16.958
I should have covered my ears sooner.

920
01:05:17.042 --> 01:05:18.583
Now my head feels weird.

921
01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:22.667
That's probably normal.
It was really loud.

922
01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:31.000
Was it like a, um, like a-a plane
breaking the sound barrier?

923
01:05:31.083 --> 01:05:35.125
Or whatever that... a sonic boom.
Was, was that a sonic boom?

924
01:05:35.208 --> 01:05:37.833
Planes don't usually
break the sound barrier.

925
01:05:38.542 --> 01:05:40.417
The Concorde doesn't fly anymore.

926
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.625
Maybe it was a plane
that we don't know about.

927
01:05:44.917 --> 01:05:46.792
Archie, why don't you go get changed.

928
01:05:48.083 --> 01:05:49.667
[Ruth] Rose, maybe you should too.

929
01:05:51.583 --> 01:05:52.583
That's a good idea.

930
01:05:52.625 --> 01:05:55.505
Why don't you go cuddle up in Mommy's bed
and read that book Dad got you.

931
01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:06.208
We're, um, we're going to be okay, right?

932
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:08.500
Yeah.

933
01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:19.125
Since you're the one
with the crystal ball, what was that?

934
01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:21.000
Was that a bomb? A missile?

935
01:06:21.083 --> 01:06:23.208
Could have been a power plant explosion.

936
01:06:23.292 --> 01:06:24.852
We don't know anything for certain yet.

937
01:06:24.917 --> 01:06:28.833
You seemed pretty certain a minute ago
with your fucking haunting soliloquy.

938
01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:30.083
Nothing's changed.

939
01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:33.625
Nothing's changed?

940
01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.500
Everything has changed.

941
01:06:37.583 --> 01:06:40.083
And we're sitting here like...
like I don't know what.

942
01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:43.333
Is-Is this what sitting ducks are?
Ducks sitting and waiting to be shot?

943
01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:45.792
I meant nothing has changed
in terms of what we do.

944
01:06:46.625 --> 01:06:49.542
We wait for Clay to come back
and we see what he's learned.

945
01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:51.792
Should I drive to town and look for him?

946
01:06:51.875 --> 01:06:53.518
We should fill the bathtubs full of water.

947
01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:57.542
Is there enough batteries, and Tylenol,
and food, and the generator,

948
01:06:57.625 --> 01:07:00.000
and one of those hand crank radios,

949
01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:02.101
and a straw that makes it safe
to drink dirty water.

950
01:07:02.125 --> 01:07:03.976
I think we shouldn't do anything
until Clay comes back.

951
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.750
What if he's not coming back?

952
01:07:05.833 --> 01:07:07.750
Okay, my dad is right.

953
01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:09.583
We're safe here. We should just sit tight.

954
01:07:09.667 --> 01:07:10.851
How do you know that we're safe

955
01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.184
when you don't know
what the fuck is happening to us?

956
01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:14.542
Maybe it was like,
what was that? Ten Mile Island?

957
01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:16.792
There are power plants here, aren't there?

958
01:07:16.875 --> 01:07:19.315
- Three Mile Island.
- Why are you obsessed with power plants?

959
01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:21.792
Hey, you're right. We shouldn't speculate.

960
01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:22.958
Stop saying that!

961
01:07:23.042 --> 01:07:25.917
I just want you to fucking
tell me what you're thinking.

962
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.500
There's the blackout
and then you see the planes crashing and...

963
01:07:31.292 --> 01:07:32.417
What?

964
01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:34.583
What? She's an adult.

965
01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:37.250
You cannot protect her,
just like you cannot protect me right now.

966
01:07:37.958 --> 01:07:42.167
The satellite phone not working
and then that noise, and then what?

967
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:44.458
What happens next in that sequence?

968
01:07:44.542 --> 01:07:46.208
Everything I know I have told you.

969
01:07:46.292 --> 01:07:47.875
I don't believe you.

970
01:07:47.958 --> 01:07:50.625
I haven't believed you
since you walked through that front door.

971
01:07:50.708 --> 01:07:54.167
Golly. I wonder what it is about us
that makes you so mistrustful.

972
01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:55.125
Ruth...

973
01:07:55.208 --> 01:07:58.333
You always think you know
what you're talking about, don't you?

974
01:07:58.417 --> 01:08:00.875
Well, ain't that the pot
calling the kettle black?

975
01:08:00.958 --> 01:08:02.458
Ruth.

976
01:08:19.417 --> 01:08:22.458
[tense music]

977
01:08:33.417 --> 01:08:34.417
He knew.

978
01:08:36.917 --> 01:08:38.833
At the market in town yesterday,

979
01:08:38.917 --> 01:08:40.917
there was a guy in the parking lot.

980
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.875
He bought cases of water and canned goods.

981
01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:52.792
He knew this was going to happen.

982
01:08:54.083 --> 01:08:55.375
Bearded guy?

983
01:08:57.083 --> 01:08:58.792
Probably wearing an old Cowboys hat.

984
01:09:00.333 --> 01:09:01.958
That's Danny.

985
01:09:02.042 --> 01:09:04.208
He's the contractor
I was telling you about.

986
01:09:05.958 --> 01:09:07.667
The one who worked on the house.

987
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.250
I wouldn't read into it.

988
01:09:10.333 --> 01:09:11.917
He's a self-proclaimed survivalist.

989
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.917
That shopping list was probably
a typical weekend for him.

990
01:09:19.042 --> 01:09:20.417
Jesus Christ.

991
01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:25.083
I'm here. I'm okay, are you okay?
Where are the kids?

992
01:09:25.167 --> 01:09:27.292
- Everyone's here, everyone's okay.
- Okay.

993
01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:28.775
What happened? Did you get to town?

994
01:09:28.833 --> 01:09:31.167
Uh... Uh...

995
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.833
I didn't get far.
And then I heard that noise.

996
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.042
What do you mean?
Where have you been?

997
01:09:39.125 --> 01:09:40.792
What were you doing? I was going crazy.

998
01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:44.417
I don't know, I-I just started to drive,

999
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:48.833
and then I heard that noise,
and I came right back.

1000
01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:52.708
So you didn't see anyone that might
help us figure out what's happening here.

1001
01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:54.375
No, I did not see anyone.

1002
01:09:55.917 --> 01:09:58.000
But I did see something. I saw...

1003
01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.292
Um, I, uh...

1004
01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:03.792
It was this huge, um, drone.

1005
01:10:03.875 --> 01:10:06.958
You know, flying in the middle of nowhere,
dropping off thousands of these.

1006
01:10:07.042 --> 01:10:08.708
I have no idea what it says.

1007
01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:14.583
[tense music]

1008
01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:21.667
"Death to America."

1009
01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:26.375
What?

1010
01:10:27.583 --> 01:10:28.917
"Death to America."

1011
01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:34.750
I mean, I don't know
what the rest of this means,

1012
01:10:34.833 --> 01:10:37.500
but this part,
it definitely means "Death to America."

1013
01:10:38.125 --> 01:10:40.000
I remember from a game I was playing.

1014
01:10:46.167 --> 01:10:47.792
Nothing about this makes sense.

1015
01:10:47.875 --> 01:10:50.393
If they were attacking us,
why would they advertise it like this?

1016
01:10:50.417 --> 01:10:53.268
It's not even in English. What's the point
of dropping these things here?

1017
01:10:53.292 --> 01:10:55.125
I'm pretty sure I make that first right,

1018
01:10:55.208 --> 01:10:57.000
then it's a straight shot
to the expressway?

1019
01:10:57.083 --> 01:10:59.833
With what we know, the city would be
the worst place for you to go.

1020
01:10:59.917 --> 01:11:02.958
We're not going to the city.
We're going to my sister's in Jersey.

1021
01:11:03.042 --> 01:11:05.875
But to get to New Jersey from here,
you have to drive through the city.

1022
01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:09.208
But to be clear, I make a right,
follow signs to the Expressway.

1023
01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:12.583
Yes, exactly like how you got here.
But listen to me, please.

1024
01:11:12.667 --> 01:11:15.125
This is dangerous what you're doing,
for you and your family.

1025
01:11:15.208 --> 01:11:16.208
Dad.

1026
01:11:16.625 --> 01:11:18.000
Let them go.

1027
01:11:20.625 --> 01:11:23.250
I really appreciate
you taking care of us, I do.

1028
01:11:23.333 --> 01:11:25.458
We have to do what's right for our family.

1029
01:11:26.042 --> 01:11:27.875
This is in everyone's best interest.

1030
01:11:43.458 --> 01:11:44.667
This is for the better.

1031
01:11:47.958 --> 01:11:48.958
For who?

1032
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:51.875
For us.

1033
01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:01.667
I don't want to have to agree
with that woman, but she was right.

1034
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:03.750
And you really
should've told me what you saw.

1035
01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:05.333
Hey, I know what you're thinking,

1036
01:12:05.417 --> 01:12:07.893
but I'm certain your mother's plane
wouldn't be flying over here.

1037
01:12:07.917 --> 01:12:09.500
It wasn't the same airline.

1038
01:12:13.167 --> 01:12:14.208
Is she gone?

1039
01:12:14.292 --> 01:12:17.208
Oh, come on now.
Why are you even going there?

1040
01:12:17.292 --> 01:12:19.625
I just told you,
it wasn't even the same airline.

1041
01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:21.500
Yeah, but does it feel like she's gone?

1042
01:12:24.792 --> 01:12:26.625
[voice shaking] Because it does to me.

1043
01:12:31.458 --> 01:12:35.125
If we hit traffic, at least
we'll be able to talk to people,

1044
01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:37.333
see if anyone has information
about what's going on.

1045
01:12:37.417 --> 01:12:39.125
It's crazy we haven't seen anyone.

1046
01:12:40.333 --> 01:12:43.250
I'm sure we will see someone
as soon as we hit the Expressway.

1047
01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:46.625
[Amanda] Phones could work
in New Jersey.

1048
01:12:46.708 --> 01:12:49.875
The truth is we don't know anything
that's going on outside of Long Island.

1049
01:12:49.958 --> 01:12:52.667
They could have internet,
the phone lines could be okay.

1050
01:12:53.625 --> 01:12:56.583
We'll look back on this one day
and laugh, I guarantee you.

1051
01:12:56.667 --> 01:12:59.250
The vacation from Hell. [chuckles]

1052
01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.542
Things get funnier with time.
Isn't that what they say?

1053
01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:04.042
I think they say it a little differently.

1054
01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:06.250
But, you know, I know what you mean.

1055
01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:07.958
[siren blares]

1056
01:13:08.042 --> 01:13:09.125
Sirens.

1057
01:13:11.292 --> 01:13:12.833
I thought you were napping, honey.

1058
01:13:12.917 --> 01:13:14.000
[Rose] I can't.

1059
01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:15.250
Why not?

1060
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.125
Because of the sirens.

1061
01:13:17.208 --> 01:13:19.208
[siren continues in distance]

1062
01:13:20.583 --> 01:13:21.667
What is that?

1063
01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:34.583
[siren blares]

1064
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:45.670
You stay with the kids.
I'm gonna go take a look.

1065
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:47.208
[seat belt clicks]

1066
01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:53.375
[siren blares faintly]

1067
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
[tense music]

1068
01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:29.125
You know what, you guys, sit...

1069
01:14:29.208 --> 01:14:30.542
Sit tight, okay?

1070
01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:33.417
See anyone?

1071
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.375
[tense music]

1072
01:14:35.458 --> 01:14:36.750
There's nobody here.

1073
01:14:45.292 --> 01:14:46.792
They're all brand new.

1074
01:14:47.292 --> 01:14:48.292
What?

1075
01:14:50.917 --> 01:14:53.583
Oh, wow. Hey, someone's coming.

1076
01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:55.000
Yo!

1077
01:15:13.792 --> 01:15:14.833
Clay!

1078
01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:18.292
- Clay, get in the car!
- Wait, shouldn't we wait and talk to them?

1079
01:15:18.375 --> 01:15:20.917
- Get in the fucking car right now!
- All right, all right.

1080
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
[suspenseful music builds]

1081
01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:25.125
[engine starts]

1082
01:15:25.208 --> 01:15:27.250
What are you doing?
Shouldn't we flag them down?

1083
01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:29.917
- Maybe they know something.
- There's no one in that car!

1084
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.667
[tires screeching]

1085
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:33.167
[Rose screams]

1086
01:15:34.208 --> 01:15:36.833
Mom? Mom, on your left, there's a car!
Go, go, go, go!

1087
01:15:36.917 --> 01:15:38.125
[tires screech]

1088
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
- [Amanda screams]
- [car scrapes]

1089
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.042
[all screaming]

1090
01:15:50.125 --> 01:15:53.167
[suspenseful music]

1091
01:16:05.917 --> 01:16:07.708
[distant siren wailing]

1092
01:16:13.458 --> 01:16:17.000
[thunder rumbles]

1093
01:16:25.917 --> 01:16:27.792
What if we went to a shelter?

1094
01:16:29.583 --> 01:16:32.583
Does the military have a bomb shelter
or a base around here?

1095
01:16:32.667 --> 01:16:35.083
I mean, don't they
have to have those things ready for...

1096
01:16:36.083 --> 01:16:37.667
...emergencies like these?

1097
01:16:40.042 --> 01:16:41.250
I don't know where they are.

1098
01:16:42.875 --> 01:16:45.917
Even if I did, you said
all those cars came off the lot.

1099
01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:51.292
If they did that to every dealership,
the main roads are most likely clogged up.

1100
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:54.167
We stay here till we know more.

1101
01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:55.518
How much more do we need to know?

1102
01:16:55.542 --> 01:16:57.375
We're probably
in the middle of a war zone.

1103
01:16:57.458 --> 01:16:59.500
People we know are likely dead.

1104
01:17:02.375 --> 01:17:03.583
Ruth.

1105
01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:06.417
[Ruth sobs]

1106
01:17:11.125 --> 01:17:12.125
Just...

1107
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.917
We just need to make a plan.

1108
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.333
We can't sit here and do nothing.
We need to go somewhere.

1109
01:17:16.417 --> 01:17:18.750
He's right, Amanda.
It's too dangerous.

1110
01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:22.833
We stay here tonight,
and then in the morning, maybe...

1111
01:17:22.917 --> 01:17:24.875
- Maybe what?
- Maybe... I don't know.

1112
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.250
[somber music]

1113
01:17:34.167 --> 01:17:35.333
I was so close.

1114
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.667
[sighs]

1115
01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:00.750
[sighs]

1116
01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:12.625
[sighs]

1117
01:18:20.833 --> 01:18:21.833
What are you doing?

1118
01:18:24.083 --> 01:18:25.542
Filling up the tub.

1119
01:18:26.458 --> 01:18:28.083
That's what they say to do for,

1120
01:18:29.083 --> 01:18:31.083
you know, water.

1121
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:33.750
Do you vape?

1122
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:35.542
Not really.

1123
01:18:36.042 --> 01:18:38.958
I mean, is that...
That's like, marijuana?

1124
01:18:39.042 --> 01:18:42.292
I mean, I know they got different kinds
now, like fruit flavors or...

1125
01:18:42.375 --> 01:18:43.417
Like marijuana.

1126
01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:48.583
[inhaling]

1127
01:18:49.667 --> 01:18:51.307
Have you ever fucked
one of your students?

1128
01:18:51.375 --> 01:18:53.958
[gasps and coughs]

1129
01:18:55.667 --> 01:18:57.583
I can't believe you just asked me that.

1130
01:18:57.667 --> 01:19:00.792
I mean, is that what I look like to you?
I look like that kind of guy?

1131
01:19:00.875 --> 01:19:04.583
You look like the kind of guy
to whom things come easy.

1132
01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:06.667
Especially women.

1133
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:09.917
Well, I'll take that as a compliment,
I guess. Hmm?

1134
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:12.750
[both laugh]

1135
01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:19.250
[light switch clicking]

1136
01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:21.375
[thunder rumbles]

1137
01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.833
I always thought of myself
as a sophisticated man.

1138
01:19:35.667 --> 01:19:38.125
Someone who had seen the world
for what it was.

1139
01:19:38.792 --> 01:19:41.167
But I have never seen anything like this.

1140
01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:47.250
So now, I wonder if that thing I always
thought about myself was a delusion.

1141
01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:50.268
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

1142
01:19:50.292 --> 01:19:52.750
You dig deep enough,
it's probably all a delusion.

1143
01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:54.042
[G.H. chuckles]

1144
01:19:54.125 --> 01:19:56.000
I mean, take your line of work,
for example.

1145
01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.750
Imaginary numbers,

1146
01:19:58.833 --> 01:20:03.125
moving around imaginary money,
leading to imaginary success.

1147
01:20:03.208 --> 01:20:07.292
Personally, I think my business
is a lot less complicated than all that.

1148
01:20:07.375 --> 01:20:11.083
At its most basic, my work is
and always has been about people.

1149
01:20:11.167 --> 01:20:13.958
- I'm real sorry for you then.
- And why is that?

1150
01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:16.042
Because people are terrible.

1151
01:20:16.125 --> 01:20:19.042
I mean, fuck.
Look at the way I treated you.

1152
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:32.375
And now we are enjoying a drink together.

1153
01:20:48.208 --> 01:20:50.125
I am sorry, by the way.

1154
01:20:51.208 --> 01:20:55.625
For what I said, did, thought,
it doesn't matter.

1155
01:20:55.708 --> 01:20:57.500
I was wrong and I'm sorry.

1156
01:21:00.417 --> 01:21:04.250
Some of my smartest clients
have lost a lot of money

1157
01:21:04.333 --> 01:21:09.583
because they based their choices
on preconceived beliefs instead of truth.

1158
01:21:11.958 --> 01:21:14.875
Seeing the difference is one
of the hardest things a person can do.

1159
01:21:16.042 --> 01:21:19.167
When they don't and you do,
gotta be maddening.

1160
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.708
Depending on the person,

1161
01:21:21.792 --> 01:21:25.583
I might take a little satisfaction
in watching the market punish them.

1162
01:21:25.667 --> 01:21:26.917
[chuckles]

1163
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.667
The scary ones, though,
are the ones who don't learn.

1164
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:32.750
Even after they lose lots,
and I mean lots, of money.

1165
01:21:34.958 --> 01:21:37.458
Nothing frightens me more
than a person unwilling to learn,

1166
01:21:37.542 --> 01:21:38.958
even at their own expense.

1167
01:21:41.583 --> 01:21:43.958
That's a darkness I will never understand.

1168
01:21:55.042 --> 01:21:56.542
The quiet is so noisy.

1169
01:21:58.542 --> 01:22:01.833
It's one of the first things I noticed
when we started spending nights here.

1170
01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:04.125
Found it hard to sleep.

1171
01:22:05.333 --> 01:22:07.500
Not like at home,
where you hear everything.

1172
01:22:08.667 --> 01:22:11.500
Sirens, traffic, people.

1173
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:14.125
I miss that.

1174
01:22:14.917 --> 01:22:16.583
Which, the sirens or the people?

1175
01:22:16.667 --> 01:22:19.125
[laughs]

1176
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:22.750
[both laughing]

1177
01:22:23.833 --> 01:22:25.625
I am starting to like you,

1178
01:22:26.333 --> 01:22:28.917
and that is a bold statement
coming from me because...

1179
01:22:30.833 --> 01:22:33.167
I can't remember
the last time I liked anybody.

1180
01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:37.458
I have to say, I found you
very prickly at the outset,

1181
01:22:37.542 --> 01:22:38.958
but you've grown on me.

1182
01:22:39.042 --> 01:22:40.375
[laughs]

1183
01:22:48.667 --> 01:22:50.125
Why did you really come here?

1184
01:22:51.583 --> 01:22:53.792
And don't tell me
it's because of your knee.

1185
01:22:54.292 --> 01:22:57.375
That wasn't a lie.
I did have a knee surgery.

1186
01:22:57.458 --> 01:23:00.583
Twisted it up pretty bad
playing ball down at the Y.

1187
01:23:00.667 --> 01:23:02.542
But it's not why you came here.

1188
01:23:08.125 --> 01:23:13.042
Why I came here involves something
that happened to me a few years back.

1189
01:23:15.917 --> 01:23:19.292
One of my clients invited me
and my wife to a private event.

1190
01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:21.333
My client, he...

1191
01:23:22.375 --> 01:23:23.375
Well.

1192
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:28.375
I won't say his name,
but you'd recognize it though.

1193
01:23:28.958 --> 01:23:31.500
- Is he a celebrity?
- Oh, no. Nothing like that.

1194
01:23:31.583 --> 01:23:34.625
But in the business world,
he's one of the biggest out there.

1195
01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:39.292
He deals mostly in defense contracting.

1196
01:23:39.375 --> 01:23:43.458
I'm talking hush-hush,
top-secret money from the Pentagon.

1197
01:23:43.542 --> 01:23:46.167
Perhaps the most powerful person
I've ever had a meal with.

1198
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:50.000
Anyway, we're at this soiree at his house.

1199
01:23:50.083 --> 01:23:53.167
It's getting late.
My wife, she wants to go.

1200
01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:57.167
But he and I are just having a blast,
and he doesn't want the night to end.

1201
01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:59.583
After a few more glares,

1202
01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:03.292
my wife agrees to take a cab
and I'll come home after.

1203
01:24:03.375 --> 01:24:05.708
Mm, I bet she was real happy about that.

1204
01:24:05.792 --> 01:24:07.125
[G.H.] Mm-hmm. [laughs]

1205
01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:12.083
So, we're having a few more drinks,
getting really sauced, and at one point,

1206
01:24:12.167 --> 01:24:16.000
I don't think he could stand
and I was pretty wobbly, myself.

1207
01:24:16.083 --> 01:24:18.125
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.

1208
01:24:18.208 --> 01:24:19.708
[G.H. laughs]

1209
01:24:19.792 --> 01:24:22.833
So he takes me to his study.

1210
01:24:22.917 --> 01:24:24.667
Smoke a few cigars

1211
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:28.958
and we're sort of flying high,
laughing at almost everything.

1212
01:24:29.042 --> 01:24:31.375
Eventually he starts in
on how much he likes me,

1213
01:24:31.458 --> 01:24:35.083
and how he wishes he could invite me
on this trip he's about to go on.

1214
01:24:35.667 --> 01:24:38.000
What kind of trip? Where is he going?

1215
01:24:38.083 --> 01:24:40.208
That's exactly what I asked.

1216
01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:42.875
Then he...

1217
01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:45.458
turns to me,

1218
01:24:45.542 --> 01:24:46.792
serious face.

1219
01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:49.958
And he says...

1220
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:52.167
"Oh, you know,

1221
01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:53.792
"just my annual meeting

1222
01:24:53.875 --> 01:24:56.750
with the rest of the evil cabal
that runs the world."

1223
01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:02.125
[both laugh]

1224
01:25:02.208 --> 01:25:04.875
He was the kind of guy
that was always known for jokes like that.

1225
01:25:04.958 --> 01:25:07.958
Again, if I told you his name,
you would understand.

1226
01:25:08.042 --> 01:25:10.625
Well, I just have
to take your word for it.

1227
01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:13.792
And now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna top off my wine.

1228
01:25:15.792 --> 01:25:19.042
Then yesterday,
before the symphony,

1229
01:25:19.125 --> 01:25:20.625
my friend calls me up.

1230
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:25.167
No scheduled appointment,
like he usually does.

1231
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:27.833
Just calls me out of the blue

1232
01:25:27.917 --> 01:25:30.208
and wants me to move around
some of his money.

1233
01:25:31.833 --> 01:25:34.292
And we're talking some big numbers,
even for him.

1234
01:25:36.208 --> 01:25:39.875
And as we're getting off the phone,
I asked if he wanted to grab a drink.

1235
01:25:39.958 --> 01:25:42.167
He tells me he's going away for a while.

1236
01:25:43.333 --> 01:25:44.917
And I joke back to him,

1237
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.333
"Oh, yeah? You hanging
with your evil cabal this weekend?

1238
01:25:48.417 --> 01:25:50.458
I thought that was only
during the winter solstice."

1239
01:25:50.542 --> 01:25:51.667
[laughs]

1240
01:25:54.708 --> 01:25:56.083
But he doesn't laugh.

1241
01:25:57.667 --> 01:26:00.292
And he always laughs, even with bad jokes.

1242
01:26:02.125 --> 01:26:03.292
All he said was...

1243
01:26:04.917 --> 01:26:06.208
"Take care of yourself."

1244
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.750
Almost as if he felt sorry for me.

1245
01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:15.000
Ever since, I haven't been
able to get it out of my head.

1246
01:26:22.542 --> 01:26:23.833
Are you saying that...

1247
01:26:23.917 --> 01:26:27.833
Are you thinking that your friend
is somehow behind what's happening here?

1248
01:26:27.917 --> 01:26:29.083
No, nothing like that.

1249
01:26:29.167 --> 01:26:32.500
A conspiracy theory about a shadowy
group of people running the world

1250
01:26:32.583 --> 01:26:34.750
is far too lazy of an explanation.

1251
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:39.000
Especially when the truth
is much scarier.

1252
01:26:40.167 --> 01:26:41.667
What is the truth?

1253
01:26:42.583 --> 01:26:44.375
No one is in control.

1254
01:26:44.458 --> 01:26:46.333
No one is pulling the strings.

1255
01:26:47.375 --> 01:26:49.292
Sure, there are those like my friend

1256
01:26:49.375 --> 01:26:53.375
who might have the right kind of access
to the right kind of information.

1257
01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:56.583
But when events like this
happen in the world,

1258
01:26:56.667 --> 01:27:00.417
the best, even the most powerful
people can hope for

1259
01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.250
is a heads up.

1260
01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:12.292
Sorry, this...

1261
01:27:13.833 --> 01:27:15.750
Guess this story's kind of a buzzkill.

1262
01:27:18.542 --> 01:27:21.208
Changed my mind.
I don't think I like you anymore.

1263
01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:30.458
Come on.

1264
01:27:32.083 --> 01:27:33.083
Let's go.

1265
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:34.917
Where are we going?

1266
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.458
I'm gonna win you over again.

1267
01:27:41.125 --> 01:27:42.417
[Archie] I see you, Rose.

1268
01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.958
[coughs]

1269
01:27:47.375 --> 01:27:48.542
What do you want?

1270
01:27:50.833 --> 01:27:53.792
I'm never going to find out what happens
to Ross and Rachel, am I?

1271
01:27:53.875 --> 01:27:55.625
You're still on this shit?

1272
01:27:55.708 --> 01:27:57.083
Who gives a fuck?

1273
01:27:57.167 --> 01:27:59.917
Well, I do. Obviously.

1274
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.042
Why do you care so much
about that show anyway?

1275
01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:06.833
[swallows] They make me happy.

1276
01:28:08.042 --> 01:28:10.333
I really need that right now. Don't you?

1277
01:28:17.833 --> 01:28:20.125
If there's any hope left
in this fucked up world,

1278
01:28:20.208 --> 01:28:22.917
I wanna at least find out
how things turn out for them.

1279
01:28:28.417 --> 01:28:29.625
I care about them.

1280
01:28:32.792 --> 01:28:33.917
Maybe you shouldn't.

1281
01:28:35.042 --> 01:28:36.083
I'm just saying.

1282
01:28:36.958 --> 01:28:39.750
You're probably right,
the way things are going

1283
01:28:39.833 --> 01:28:42.042
you're not gonna see
that show ever again.

1284
01:28:43.125 --> 01:28:45.958
So if I were you,
I'd find something else to care about.

1285
01:28:52.625 --> 01:28:55.042
[Ruth] It's weird, we're not hearing
any cicadas tonight.

1286
01:28:55.125 --> 01:28:57.125
[vape hissing]

1287
01:28:58.417 --> 01:28:59.458
I got lost today.

1288
01:29:01.833 --> 01:29:03.292
When I went out this morning.

1289
01:29:05.375 --> 01:29:06.875
What do you mean you got lost?

1290
01:29:06.958 --> 01:29:08.667
Well,

1291
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:10.417
I thought I knew where I was going

1292
01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:13.833
but then there were all these streets
that didn't have any signs anywhere.

1293
01:29:14.458 --> 01:29:16.917
So I just drove around.

1294
01:29:17.833 --> 01:29:19.542
Then I drove around some more.

1295
01:29:20.833 --> 01:29:25.667
And then, you know, I turn around,
and then I got just completely lost,

1296
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:28.542
and I have no idea how I found
my way back here, to be honest.

1297
01:29:33.625 --> 01:29:35.208
But I did see someone.

1298
01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:40.708
A woman.

1299
01:29:42.208 --> 01:29:43.208
On the road.

1300
01:29:45.042 --> 01:29:48.250
She waved me down and, um,

1301
01:29:48.875 --> 01:29:50.542
she was speaking Spanish.

1302
01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:53.250
She was just standing there

1303
01:29:53.333 --> 01:29:55.958
by the side of the road
in the middle of nowhere.

1304
01:29:56.042 --> 01:29:57.042
[voice shaking] And I...

1305
01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:00.250
I left her.

1306
01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:03.917
She needed help.

1307
01:30:05.417 --> 01:30:06.417
And I left her.

1308
01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:24.583
Well, is there anything else
that you're keeping from us?

1309
01:30:25.583 --> 01:30:28.042
Since you're opening up, that is.

1310
01:30:31.458 --> 01:30:35.958
Well, we didn't tell you before
that we saw an oil tanker ground.

1311
01:30:36.042 --> 01:30:38.083
Like, right up on the beach.

1312
01:30:38.167 --> 01:30:39.500
An oil tanker?

1313
01:30:39.583 --> 01:30:42.917
Yeah, it's like a really big boat.

1314
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.250
You know, it's red.

1315
01:30:44.333 --> 01:30:47.917
I mean, well,
I don't think that they're all red,

1316
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.833
but this one was,
and it came right up on the beach.

1317
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:54.250
Why didn't you tell us?

1318
01:30:54.333 --> 01:30:57.542
Well, I think at the time
we were both scared, you know?

1319
01:31:00.333 --> 01:31:01.542
About what it could mean.

1320
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:04.042
Well, what could it mean?

1321
01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:06.500
Well, if we were being attacked,

1322
01:31:06.583 --> 01:31:10.333
which I know sounds weird to say,
but oil is something

1323
01:31:10.417 --> 01:31:11.750
that you would want a lot of

1324
01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.750
if, you know,
we're going to defend ourselves.

1325
01:31:13.833 --> 01:31:15.792
I cannot believe
we're having this conversation.

1326
01:31:15.875 --> 01:31:18.042
I really think we're gonna be all right.

1327
01:31:18.125 --> 01:31:20.875
You know, I mean,
in the end, I really do.

1328
01:31:20.958 --> 01:31:22.833
I mean, even if it is like, an invasion.

1329
01:31:22.917 --> 01:31:23.750
An invasion?

1330
01:31:23.833 --> 01:31:25.458
Well, or an occupation?

1331
01:31:25.542 --> 01:31:28.000
Okay, dude, you know what?
I know that you mean well,

1332
01:31:28.083 --> 01:31:31.750
but your word choices are, like,
freaking me the fuck out.

Those are flamingos.

1341
01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:08.292
Why?

1342
01:32:10.792 --> 01:32:13.833
Wow, this is an impressive collection.

1343
01:32:15.792 --> 01:32:16.958
You like jazz?

1344
01:32:18.542 --> 01:32:20.417
You want to listen to jazz?

1345
01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.042
Sure, why not?

1346
01:32:22.125 --> 01:32:25.042
Because I thought
we were going to have some fun.

1348
01:32:26.083 --> 01:32:28.333
Let's have something we could dance to.

1349
01:32:28.417 --> 01:32:30.167
You can dance to jazz.

1350
01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:32.250
In fact, when I bought
my first record, that was...

1351

Oh, please
not another one of your stories.

1352
01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:38.083
They end up leaving me severely disturbed.
Wait. What are these records?

1353
01:32:38.167 --> 01:32:40.417
Don't look over there.
Those are my daughter's records.

1354
01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:43.792
She had a DJ phase in college.

1355
01:32:43.875 --> 01:32:47.292
Now this looks like something
a lady can properly dance to.

Oh, come on.
That's not what I brought you in here for.

I keep thinking about
this one <i>West Wing</i> episode.

1450
01:36:59.042 --> 01:37:01.125
There's this story,
someone tells the president...

1451
01:37:01.208 --> 01:37:03.125
You watched <i>The West Wing?</i>

1452
01:37:03.708 --> 01:37:05.917
Only the Aaron Sorkin seasons.

1453
01:37:07.333 --> 01:37:12.500
Anyway, the story was about a man
who lived by the river.

1454
01:37:12.583 --> 01:37:15.750
And he hears on the radio
that the river is going to flood the town

1455
01:37:15.833 --> 01:37:17.458
and everyone should leave.

1456
01:37:17.542 --> 01:37:22.125
But the man doesn't go anywhere
because he prays every day.

1457
01:37:22.208 --> 01:37:24.500
He knows that God loves him
and will save him.

1458
01:37:25.083 --> 01:37:27.208
But then the flood actually happens.

1459
01:37:27.292 --> 01:37:30.000
And this guy in a rowboat sees the man

1460
01:37:30.083 --> 01:37:32.917
and says,
"Hey, come on, I can save you."

1461
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.042
But the man tells him
he isn't going anywhere.

1462
01:37:35.708 --> 01:37:39.833
Then the helicopter comes flying by,
and the pilot lowers the ladder,

1463
01:37:39.917 --> 01:37:42.292
but the man tells him
he isn't going anywhere.

1464
01:37:43.042 --> 01:37:45.542
After that, the man drowns in the flood.

1465
01:37:45.625 --> 01:37:49.417
And so he goes up to heaven
and he's really angry at God,

1466
01:37:50.208 --> 01:37:52.833
and he tells him,
"I prayed to you every day.

1467
01:37:52.917 --> 01:37:55.667
I thought you loved me.
Why didn't you save me?"

01:42:55.042 --> 01:42:56.125
[Clay] Is everything okay?

1534
01:42:56.667 --> 01:42:59.375
- Something's wrong with Archie.
- What is it? What the fuck?

1535
01:42:59.458 --> 01:43:02.667
- That's exactly what I said.
- My teeth just, they felt weird.

1536
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:04.630
And I touched them,
and they just they fell out.

1537
01:43:04.667 --> 01:43:06.809
He was a little warm last night
but this, I don't know.

1538
01:43:06.833 --> 01:43:09.542
Okay, all right.
Well you... you're okay.

1539
01:43:09.625 --> 01:43:11.042
I don't feel okay.

1540
01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:19.625
How are you feeling?

1541
01:43:22.542 --> 01:43:24.667
Besides your teeth falling out, I mean.

1542
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:26.792
What kind of question is that?
He's obviously sick.

1543
01:43:26.875 --> 01:43:30.417
I'm not sick, Mom. My teeth just fell out.

1544
01:43:32.167 --> 01:43:33.809
Maybe it was the bug that bit me.
I don't know.

1545
01:43:33.833 --> 01:43:34.833
What bug?

1546
01:43:35.667 --> 01:43:37.917
A bug bit me yesterday in the woods.

1547
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.250
[G.H.] That must be it, then.

1548
01:43:39.333 --> 01:43:43.417
Probably just a tick, Lyme disease.
I've seen stranger symptoms.

1549
01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:44.833
Stranger than this?

1550
01:43:44.917 --> 01:43:46.268
He needs to go to the emergency room.

1551
01:43:46.292 --> 01:43:47.492
We need to go to the hospital.

1552
01:43:47.542 --> 01:43:50.625
We can't. The expressway's
the only way out of town.

1553
01:43:50.708 --> 01:43:53.518
Besides, if the roads are jammed,
no one would be there to help us anyway.

1554
01:43:53.542 --> 01:43:56.750
Well, we have to do something.
Archie needs to see a doctor.

1555
01:43:57.333 --> 01:43:59.458
[sighs] I can't believe this is happening.

1556
01:43:59.542 --> 01:44:01.625
I can't believe this is happening.

1557
01:44:05.083 --> 01:44:08.042
We'll go to my contractor's house.
He's not that far from here.

1558
01:44:08.125 --> 01:44:10.958
You said you saw him
stocking up on supplies?

1559
01:44:11.042 --> 01:44:12.833
If I know Danny,
he's prepared for anything.

1560
01:44:12.917 --> 01:44:14.167
He might have something useful.

1561
01:44:14.250 --> 01:44:15.917
Antibiotics, medicine.

1562
01:44:16.583 --> 01:44:17.875
Danny'll know what to do.

1563
01:44:19.125 --> 01:44:20.125
Hey.

1564
01:44:20.708 --> 01:44:23.542
I promise you,
I'll get your son some help.

1565
01:44:23.625 --> 01:44:25.250
[door opens]

1566
01:44:25.333 --> 01:44:26.333
Where's Rose?

1567
01:44:28.375 --> 01:44:29.458
I couldn't find her.

1568
01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:32.167
What? What does that mean?

1569
01:44:32.250 --> 01:44:34.292
I looked all over the house.
She's not here.

1570
01:44:34.375 --> 01:44:36.458
- She's not in the backyard.
- I'll look downstairs.

1571
01:44:36.542 --> 01:44:38.125
She's probably exploring the house.

1572
01:44:38.208 --> 01:44:40.184
She might be playing outside.
I'll look out for her.

1573
01:44:40.208 --> 01:44:41.809
I looked there
but feel free to check again.

1574
01:44:41.833 --> 01:44:43.059
I don't understand.
Where is she?

1575
01:44:43.083 --> 01:44:44.963
- She has to be here somewhere.
- No, she's not!

1576
01:44:45.042 --> 01:44:48.208
I'm telling you, I have
looked everywhere and she's not here.

1577
01:44:48.292 --> 01:44:51.625
- Well, she should be in the garage.
- I already looked in the garage.

1578
01:44:51.708 --> 01:44:53.750
Okay. Where the fuck
haven't you looked, Clay?

1579
01:44:55.167 --> 01:44:56.583
She's not down there.

1580
01:44:56.667 --> 01:44:58.583
Okay, this is insane. Where is she?

1581
01:44:58.667 --> 01:44:59.667
She wasn't outside,

1582
01:44:59.750 --> 01:45:02.184
but I think she may have taken
one of the bikes from the garage.

1583
01:45:02.208 --> 01:45:03.917
Took one of the bikes?
Where would she go?

1584
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.080
Do you have any idea
where your sister might be, bud?

1585
01:45:06.458 --> 01:45:07.458
I don't know.

1586
01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:10.208
Um, we were out
by the shed yesterday, so...

1587
01:45:10.292 --> 01:45:11.542
The shed? What shed?

1588
01:45:11.625 --> 01:45:13.000
The... the shed.

1589
01:45:13.083 --> 01:45:16.042
Um, she... she saw some deer
and she wanted to go look for them.

1590
01:45:16.125 --> 01:45:18.875
- So maybe there. I don't know.
- Okay, I'm going.

1591
01:45:21.708 --> 01:45:24.125
- [Archie retches]
- Archie, you all right?

1592
01:45:24.208 --> 01:45:26.667
- [Archie grunts and moans]
- Are you all right...

1593
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:28.601
- [G.H.] He needs help now.
- [Clay] Yeah, okay.

1594
01:45:28.625 --> 01:45:30.583
- Okay, I got you.
- [Ruth] I'm coming with you.

1595
01:45:30.667 --> 01:45:32.000
[G.H.] No, it's not safe.

1596
01:45:32.083 --> 01:45:34.042
Stay here with Amanda. Find Rose.

1597
01:45:34.125 --> 01:45:36.292
No. What?
You can't leave me here by myself.

1598
01:45:36.375 --> 01:45:38.135
- It'll be okay.
- Dad, we talked about this.

1599
01:45:38.208 --> 01:45:39.792
You cannot leave me here by myself.

1600
01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:42.958
- He's sick, don't you see that?
- Dad, you will never come back.

1601
01:45:43.042 --> 01:45:45.000
Don't you see that something is happening?

1602
01:45:45.083 --> 01:45:46.333
It is happening right now.

1603
01:45:46.417 --> 01:45:49.292
Whatever it is, it's happening to Archie,
it's happening to all of us.

1604
01:45:49.375 --> 01:45:51.917
You can't leave.
The world could be ending out there.

1605
01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.375
That's why I want you here.

1606
01:45:54.458 --> 01:45:55.542
Take out your phone.

1607
01:45:56.792 --> 01:45:58.375
Come on, take it out.

1608
01:45:58.458 --> 01:45:59.833
Set a timer, one hour.

1609
01:46:00.667 --> 01:46:01.667
I'll be back.

1610
01:46:02.833 --> 01:46:03.833
It won't work.

1611
01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:05.500
It won't work out.

1612
01:46:05.583 --> 01:46:07.208
It will, there's no choice.

1613
01:46:07.292 --> 01:46:09.958
Look, I'll be back for you
before this goes off.

1614
01:46:19.542 --> 01:46:22.708
One hour.
That's what you get. You've promised.

1615
01:46:32.167 --> 01:46:35.833
[echoing] Rose? Rose!

1616
01:46:35.917 --> 01:46:40.042
Rosie! Rose!

1617
01:46:40.125 --> 01:46:43.542
[overlapping echoes]

1618
01:46:57.542 --> 01:46:59.500
[Amanda] This is a nightmare.

1619
01:47:00.083 --> 01:47:01.750
This is a goddamn nightmare.

1620
01:47:03.625 --> 01:47:06.750
Where would Rose have gone?
Why would she leave?

1621
01:47:07.333 --> 01:47:09.875
She said she was done waiting.
What did she mean?

1622
01:47:12.125 --> 01:47:15.833
What if we just went back to the house
and we waited for my dad to get back?

1623
01:47:16.417 --> 01:47:17.417
And then what?

1624
01:47:18.167 --> 01:47:19.625
He'll find Rose?

1625
01:47:19.708 --> 01:47:21.792
I don't know, but he will help us.

1626
01:47:22.375 --> 01:47:24.708
I just want to know
what the fuck is happening.

1627
01:47:24.792 --> 01:47:26.542
I want to know what the fuck is the plan.

1628
01:47:26.625 --> 01:47:30.750
I want to know that we can find my kid
and then get in your fucking expensive car

1629
01:47:30.833 --> 01:47:33.750
and drive to an actual hospital,
find a doctor who will tell me

1630
01:47:33.833 --> 01:47:36.583
that my baby is okay,
that we're all gonna be okay,

1631
01:47:36.667 --> 01:47:38.750
and then we can just
all go back to our house.

1632
01:47:38.833 --> 01:47:40.125
What if that's not possible?

1633
01:47:40.208 --> 01:47:44.708
I want to get the fuck away from here,
and you, and whatever is happening.

1634
01:47:44.792 --> 01:47:46.125
It's happening to all of us.

1635
01:47:46.208 --> 01:47:48.167
I know that it is happening to all of us!

1636
01:47:48.250 --> 01:47:49.708
Stop yelling at me!

1637
01:47:59.667 --> 01:48:00.667
You don't care.

1638
01:48:03.417 --> 01:48:04.875
You don't care that I'm here.

1639
01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:10.250
And my mom is probably
at the bottom of some ocean.

1640
01:48:14.417 --> 01:48:17.208
I don't have anyone else in my life.

1641
01:48:18.375 --> 01:48:22.875
I have nothing to go home to but them.
Do you understand that?

1642
01:48:24.833 --> 01:48:28.042
And I need my mom more than ever.

1643
01:48:30.042 --> 01:48:32.333
And I will probably never see her again.

1644
01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.167
I care, I do.

1645
01:48:47.125 --> 01:48:50.250
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do about that, but I do care.

1646
01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:54.875
Why are you like this?

1647
01:48:58.417 --> 01:49:01.792
What do you get
out of being so angry all the time?

1648
01:49:13.417 --> 01:49:18.083
Every day, all day, my job...
my whole job is to...

1649
01:49:19.042 --> 01:49:22.917
...understand people well enough
so that I know how to lie to them,

1650
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.750
so I can sell them things
they don't really want.

1651
01:49:26.625 --> 01:49:28.708
And when you study people like that,

1652
01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:32.458
when you really see the way
they treat each other, well...

1653
01:49:33.875 --> 01:49:34.875
You're no dummy.

1654
01:49:35.917 --> 01:49:39.917
You see what they do, and they do it
without even thinking about it.

1655
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Fuck. I did it to you and your dad,
and I don't even really know why.

1656
01:49:45.333 --> 01:49:47.625
We fuck each other over

1657
01:49:47.708 --> 01:49:50.375
all the time,
without even realizing it.

1658
01:49:50.458 --> 01:49:55.083
We fuck every living thing on this planet
over and think it'll be fine

1659
01:49:55.167 --> 01:49:59.667
because we use paper straws
and order the free range chicken.

1660
01:50:00.625 --> 01:50:05.250
And the sick thing is, I think deep down
we know we're not fooling anyone.

1661
01:50:05.333 --> 01:50:07.292
I think we know we're living a lie.

1662
01:50:07.375 --> 01:50:09.875
An agreed upon mass delusion

1663
01:50:09.958 --> 01:50:13.667
to help us ignore and keep ignoring
how awful we really are.

1664
01:50:21.417 --> 01:50:25.250
I'm not down with most of the things
that you do and say, but...

1665
01:50:27.250 --> 01:50:30.375
...this is the part of the Venn diagram
where we overlap.

1666
01:50:32.042 --> 01:50:34.500
I agree with everything you just said.

1667
01:50:36.417 --> 01:50:41.000
But as awful as people might be...

1668
01:50:43.375 --> 01:50:46.375
...nothing's gonna change the fact
that we are all we've got.

1669
01:50:51.125 --> 01:50:52.708
I don't want to be this way.

1670
01:51:00.542 --> 01:51:02.375
I hate being terrible like this.

1671
01:51:04.667 --> 01:51:07.333
And I know I say I hate people, but I...

1672
01:51:07.417 --> 01:51:09.958
I'd do anything to have them back.

1673
01:51:10.042 --> 01:51:12.042
[wall thuds]

1674
01:51:12.125 --> 01:51:16.000
[animals galloping]

1675
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.125
[suspenseful music]

1676
01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:40.458
[hooves thudding]

1677
01:51:46.083 --> 01:51:49.083
[tense music]

1678
01:52:10.792 --> 01:52:11.958
[seatbelts click]

1679
01:52:12.042 --> 01:52:13.292
[Archie] Hey, Dad.

1680
01:52:13.875 --> 01:52:15.875
Do you think Taylor's okay?

1681
01:52:16.708 --> 01:52:17.708
Who?

1682
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:24.875
Archie, you stay here.

1683
01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:27.417
Let's go.

1684
01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.625
[doorbell chimes]

1685
01:52:45.208 --> 01:52:46.208
George.

1686
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:50.125
Danny. Sorry to bother you
at home like this.

1687
01:52:50.208 --> 01:52:52.500
I'm gonna need you and your comrade
to step off the porch

1688
01:52:52.583 --> 01:52:53.917
and stand by your vehicle.

1689
01:52:55.292 --> 01:52:56.375
What?

1690
01:52:56.458 --> 01:52:58.833
Off the porch and by your vehicle.

1691
01:53:10.458 --> 01:53:12.083
[door opens]

1692
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:22.000
What can I do for you?

1693
01:53:23.333 --> 01:53:25.333
[both laugh]

1694
01:53:27.333 --> 01:53:28.792
We're just checking on you.

1695
01:53:30.042 --> 01:53:32.167
Seeing if you're here, if you're okay.

1696
01:53:33.542 --> 01:53:36.125
If you heard anything
about what's going on.

1697
01:53:36.208 --> 01:53:37.625
Yeah, I'm Clay.

1698
01:53:37.708 --> 01:53:41.167
My family rented G.H.'s...
George's home, you know.

1699
01:53:41.250 --> 01:53:42.708
We're from the city.

1700
01:53:42.792 --> 01:53:44.958
Well, that's a lucky break
for your family.

1701
01:53:45.042 --> 01:53:47.542
Imagine what a shit show
the city must be right now.

1702
01:53:48.583 --> 01:53:51.542
I got to be honest with you,
I'm surprised you guys are even out.

1703
01:53:52.417 --> 01:53:54.958
We came out here
because my son needs help.

1704
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:58.042
He's vomiting. He's...

1705
01:53:58.125 --> 01:54:01.125
He's lost his teeth.
They just fell out. Can't explain it.

1706
01:54:01.208 --> 01:54:03.167
Oh. His teeth, huh?

1707
01:54:04.458 --> 01:54:07.042
Well, it's gotta have something
to do with that noise.

1708
01:54:10.125 --> 01:54:11.875
You know something about the noise?

1709
01:54:11.958 --> 01:54:16.708
Well, it's not all that dissimilar
to what happened in Cuba a while back.

1710
01:54:16.792 --> 01:54:19.667
Microwave weapons, they call it,
produces a kind of radiation

1711
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:21.958
that can be beamed out through sound.

1712
01:54:22.833 --> 01:54:25.792
Some people lost their teeth there too.

1713
01:54:25.875 --> 01:54:28.125
Outside of that,
the only thing I know for sure is

1714
01:54:28.208 --> 01:54:30.625
there's not a lot of information
getting out, so...

1715
01:54:32.417 --> 01:54:33.625
I assume it's a war.

1716
01:54:35.542 --> 01:54:37.167
The beginning of one, anyways.

1717
01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:38.958
They've been saying there was chatter.

1718
01:54:39.042 --> 01:54:41.250
This has to be
what they were chattering about.

1719
01:54:41.333 --> 01:54:43.667
Chatter, what do you mean, "chatter"?

1720
01:54:45.250 --> 01:54:47.917
You got to read the papers
deeper than page one.

1721
01:54:48.708 --> 01:54:52.125
The Russians recalled
their staff from Washington.

1722
01:54:52.208 --> 01:54:53.792
Did you even notice that?

1723
01:54:53.875 --> 01:54:56.958
Something is afoot.
Now, what that is exactly, I don't know.

1724
01:54:57.042 --> 01:54:59.042
Maybe this is as much
as we're ever going to know.

1725
01:54:59.125 --> 01:55:03.042
Maybe we just need to sit tight, be safe.

1726
01:55:04.542 --> 01:55:06.500
Pray. Whatever works for you.

1727
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:10.750
Well, Danny.

1728
01:55:12.333 --> 01:55:14.375
It's like Clay said, his son isn't well.

1729
01:55:15.458 --> 01:55:17.708
We're gonna need more than just prayers.

1730
01:55:17.792 --> 01:55:20.143
And knowing how primed you are
for these kind of situations,

1731
01:55:20.167 --> 01:55:22.601
we're thinking you might have
some medicine that'd be able to help him.

1732
01:55:22.625 --> 01:55:24.875
What I got isn't your business.

1733
01:55:28.583 --> 01:55:29.583
Danny.

1734
01:55:30.042 --> 01:55:32.167
Come on now, it's me.
We know each other.

1735
01:55:33.375 --> 01:55:34.375
We're friends.

1736
01:55:34.458 --> 01:55:38.542
That's the old way, George.
You're not thinking clearly.

1737
01:55:38.625 --> 01:55:40.417
Danny, what are you saying?

1738
01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.792
You're telling this man
not to take care of his son?

1739
01:55:42.875 --> 01:55:44.434
Nothing makes
a whole lot of sense right now.

1740
01:55:44.458 --> 01:55:47.542
When the world doesn't make any sense,
I can still do what's rational,

1741
01:55:47.625 --> 01:55:49.250
which is protect my own.

1742
01:55:50.125 --> 01:55:52.958
What you do is your business.

1743
01:55:53.042 --> 01:55:56.167
I thought I was doing the right thing
by bringing them here.

1744
01:55:56.250 --> 01:55:58.417
Now if you have some medicine
that can help him...

1745
01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:00.000
We can pay.

1746
01:56:00.083 --> 01:56:02.458
Um, a... a...

1747
01:56:02.542 --> 01:56:04.792
Say, a thousand dollars?

1748
01:56:04.875 --> 01:56:07.375
Cash might not mean much
if the government falls.

1749
01:56:07.458 --> 01:56:10.833
Well, the whole network's down.
My credit cards aren't going to work.

1750
01:56:10.917 --> 01:56:13.625
There's no Venmo or ApplePay.

1751
01:56:13.708 --> 01:56:16.917
I mean, cash might be the only thing
that means something.

1752
01:56:19.042 --> 01:56:22.458
My son's really sick.
He needs your help. He's 16 years old.

1753
01:56:23.708 --> 01:56:26.958
[tense music]

1754
01:56:30.833 --> 01:56:32.000
Nothing's here.

1755
01:56:50.125 --> 01:56:51.125
Rosie.

1756
01:56:54.625 --> 01:56:56.833
[Danny] You're in a difficult position.

1757
01:56:56.917 --> 01:56:58.042
I get it.

1758
01:56:58.625 --> 01:57:01.083
I would do anything I had to
for my family.

1759
01:57:01.167 --> 01:57:02.583
So that's what I'm doing.

1760
01:57:02.667 --> 01:57:05.458
I'm locking the doors.
I'm waiting, I'm watching,

1761
01:57:05.542 --> 01:57:07.500
I'm getting out my gun.

1762
01:57:07.583 --> 01:57:10.458
Other than that,
I don't have any answers for you.

1763
01:57:14.083 --> 01:57:15.708
Ruth, it's bike tracks...

1764
01:57:22.417 --> 01:57:25.333
I'm going to go back inside my house now.

1765
01:57:25.417 --> 01:57:28.333
I'm gonna say goodbye and good luck.

1766
01:57:28.417 --> 01:57:30.458
You come out again,
you're welcome to stop by,

1767
01:57:30.542 --> 01:57:33.292
but I can't offer you
much more than conversation.

1768
01:57:34.292 --> 01:57:37.083
I suggest you try
your neighbors, the Thornes.

1769
01:57:37.167 --> 01:57:38.833
They did a basement conversion

1770
01:57:38.917 --> 01:57:41.333
on the down-low a while back,
no permits or nothing.

1771
01:57:41.417 --> 01:57:43.977
A buddy of mine worked on it.
He wouldn't even show me the plans.

1772
01:57:44.042 --> 01:57:45.417
Now, you ask me?

1773
01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:48.583
That's rich asshole talk
for doomsday bunker.

1774
01:57:48.667 --> 01:57:51.083
Come on, Danny.
You can't desert us like this.

1775
01:57:53.333 --> 01:57:57.833
Haven't you been picking up
on what's going on out there, George?

1776
01:57:58.417 --> 01:58:00.083
We've all been deserted.

1777
01:58:00.167 --> 01:58:03.167
[tense music continues]

1778
01:58:27.958 --> 01:58:29.958
[breathing shakily]

1779
01:58:30.042 --> 01:58:31.458
[Danny] <i>All due respect.</i>

1780
01:58:32.542 --> 01:58:35.167
I would like all of you
off of my property.

1781
01:58:36.458 --> 01:58:37.458
Now.

1782
01:58:38.375 --> 01:58:41.375
[suspenseful music]

1783
01:58:51.583 --> 01:58:54.042
We're not going anywhere
till you give us what we need.

1784
01:59:08.125 --> 01:59:09.417
[Amanda screams]

1785
01:59:10.667 --> 01:59:12.958
[Clay yelling] What the fuck
is going on right now?

1786
01:59:13.042 --> 01:59:17.458
[screaming]

1787
01:59:17.542 --> 01:59:19.667
I promised this boy's mother
I'd get him some help.

1788
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:21.833
The only thing
you're helping him to is a quick death

1789
01:59:21.917 --> 01:59:24.500
- unless you lower your weapons.
- G.H., put the gun down.

1790
01:59:24.583 --> 01:59:27.208
- We'll find another way to the hospital.
- There is no other way!

1791
01:59:27.292 --> 01:59:28.625
Besides, he's not gonna shoot us.

1792
01:59:28.708 --> 01:59:30.833
Uh... It sounds like he's gonna shoot us.

1793
01:59:30.917 --> 01:59:32.917
- I'm telling you he's bluffing.
- The fuck I am.

1794
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:38.542
[both screaming]

1795
01:59:41.417 --> 01:59:43.042
Hold... Hold on!
Hold on!

1796
01:59:43.125 --> 01:59:44.500
- Clay, get out of the way!
- Dad!

1797
01:59:44.583 --> 01:59:46.167
I'm trying to reason with him!

1798
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:50.458
[both screaming]

1799
01:59:53.625 --> 01:59:55.333
The only way this ends

1800
01:59:55.417 --> 01:59:58.083
is if you get back in your vehicle
and drive away now.

1801
01:59:58.167 --> 02:00:01.042
Drive away to what?
All the roads are blocked.

1802
02:00:01.125 --> 02:00:03.643
We're in the middle of God-knows-where.
There's no one else around.

1803
02:00:03.667 --> 02:00:06.833
I have no idea
what I am supposed to do right now.

1804
02:00:06.917 --> 02:00:10.833
I can barely do anything
without my cell phone and my GPS.

1805
02:00:10.917 --> 02:00:13.542
I am a useless man.

1806
02:00:14.792 --> 02:00:16.833
But my son is sick.

1807
02:00:17.917 --> 02:00:20.667
And my daughter is missing.

1808
02:00:21.833 --> 02:00:23.583
And I don't know what to do.

1809
02:00:24.917 --> 02:00:28.542
But you are a very prepared man.

1810
02:00:28.625 --> 02:00:29.750
Fuck yeah, I am.

1811
02:00:29.833 --> 02:00:31.433
That's right, that's why we came to you,

1812
02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:33.417
because you're the only one
who can help my son.

1813
02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:36.417
- Not my problem.
- No, you're right. It's not.

1814
02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:39.708
But it's like you said, right?

1815
02:00:39.792 --> 02:00:43.042
What would you do if it was your family?
That's what I'm doing.

1816
02:00:43.125 --> 02:00:44.875
It's the only thing I can do.

1817
02:00:45.458 --> 02:00:47.333
I am begging you.

1818
02:00:47.417 --> 02:00:48.417
Please.

1819
02:00:49.458 --> 02:00:51.375
Please help my son.

1820
02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:58.708
[both screaming]

1821
02:01:01.792 --> 02:01:04.500
[screaming and whimpering]

1822
02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:10.208
[hoof beats receding]

1823
02:01:10.292 --> 02:01:14.042
[breathing heavily]

1824
02:01:17.958 --> 02:01:22.417
[sighs and whimpers]

1825
02:01:33.375 --> 02:01:37.500
I guess an old fashioned barter system
was to be expected at some point.

1826
02:01:38.583 --> 02:01:41.292
It's still cash,
so it's not really a barter system.

1827
02:01:41.375 --> 02:01:43.792
[Danny] Hey, I got another tidbit for you.

1828
02:01:43.875 --> 02:01:45.583
Free of charge, if you want it.

1829
02:01:47.833 --> 02:01:49.958
It's the Koreans behind all this.

1830
02:01:51.042 --> 02:01:52.042
Koreans?

1831
02:01:55.792 --> 02:01:57.167
What makes you say that?

1832
02:01:57.250 --> 02:01:59.625
Just trust me. It's the Koreans.

1833
02:01:59.708 --> 02:02:01.375
Or the Chinese. One of them.

1834
02:02:05.208 --> 02:02:06.500
Show him.

1835
02:02:10.208 --> 02:02:12.500
I was driving around yesterday.

1836
02:02:12.583 --> 02:02:15.583
There's a big drone
dropping these everywhere.

1837
02:02:15.667 --> 02:02:20.833
It means "Death to America,"
so we're thinking Iranians.

1838
02:02:21.875 --> 02:02:25.667
I remember hearing something on NPR once
about their cyber capabilities.

1839
02:02:29.333 --> 02:02:30.333
Why is that funny?

1840
02:02:32.917 --> 02:02:35.208
Before the phones went out,

1841
02:02:35.292 --> 02:02:39.167
I heard from a friend of mine in San Diego
about a similar event,

1842
02:02:39.250 --> 02:02:43.000
drones dropping pamphlets
except they were in Korean.

1843
02:02:43.083 --> 02:02:46.208
Or Mandarin.
Like I said, he couldn't tell which.

1844
02:02:46.292 --> 02:02:49.875
But seeing as he did four tours in Iraq,

1845
02:02:49.958 --> 02:02:52.583
he sure as shit would have known
if it looked like that.

1846
02:02:58.417 --> 02:03:01.292
We made a lot of enemies around the world.

1847
02:03:01.375 --> 02:03:03.958
Maybe all this means
is a few of them teamed up.

1848
02:03:05.333 --> 02:03:09.167
[tense music]

1849
02:03:12.542 --> 02:03:14.500
I saw flamingos in our pool last night.

1850
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:19.708
The animals, they're trying to warn us.

1851
02:03:22.208 --> 02:03:23.583
They know something.

1852
02:03:24.875 --> 02:03:27.125
They know something that we don't.

1853
02:03:27.208 --> 02:03:29.667
It's like when dogs know
storms are coming.

1854
02:03:31.708 --> 02:03:33.500
There's more bike tracks up ahead.

1855
02:03:40.125 --> 02:03:43.375
We should go back to the house.
My dad is probably there.

1856
02:03:43.458 --> 02:03:45.750
Maybe he can help... us.

1857
02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:50.625
I'm not going anywhere without Rosie.

1858
02:03:56.250 --> 02:03:59.292
That house.
That's gotta be where she went.

1859
02:04:00.583 --> 02:04:01.625
[engine revs]

1860
02:04:01.708 --> 02:04:04.000
All right, let's go back
and see if they found Rose.

1861
02:04:04.083 --> 02:04:08.708
[tense music continues]

1862
02:04:19.375 --> 02:04:22.167
G.H., what's going on?

1863
02:04:24.917 --> 02:04:26.042
Before we go...

1864
02:04:28.792 --> 02:04:31.042
I need to know
that you're on the level with me.

1865
02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:37.125
No matter how far this thing goes,
I need to know that we're good

1866
02:04:37.208 --> 02:04:39.750
because if what just happened here
is happening everywhere,

1867
02:04:39.833 --> 02:04:42.000
we need to get to that bunker
Danny told us about,

1868
02:04:42.083 --> 02:04:44.250
and we need to get there now.

1869
02:04:44.333 --> 02:04:45.875
What are you talking about?

1870
02:04:50.333 --> 02:04:51.458
You know something.

1871
02:04:56.833 --> 02:05:00.000
I had a sneaking suspicion,
but I wanted more information first.

1872
02:05:00.958 --> 02:05:03.000
All signs were there, sure, but I...

1873
02:05:04.167 --> 02:05:06.458
I didn't want to scare anyone.

1874
02:05:06.542 --> 02:05:08.792
You'd have called me crazy
because it is crazy.

1875
02:05:08.875 --> 02:05:11.768
It would have made more sense if we were
on the brink of an all-out invasion,

1876
02:05:11.792 --> 02:05:12.917
but this...

1877
02:05:15.375 --> 02:05:17.434
I didn't think we'd actually let
something like this happen.

1878
02:05:17.458 --> 02:05:18.851
I thought we were smarter than that.

1879
02:05:18.875 --> 02:05:20.000
Let what happen?

1880
02:05:24.292 --> 02:05:26.542
Because my primary client
works in the defense sector,

1881
02:05:26.625 --> 02:05:30.792
I spend a lot of time studying the cost
benefit analysis of military campaigns.

1882
02:05:31.708 --> 02:05:35.250
There was one program in particular
that terrified my client the most.

1883
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.083
A simple three-stage maneuver that could
topple a country's government from within.

1884
02:05:43.125 --> 02:05:46.250
The first stage is isolation.

1885
02:05:46.333 --> 02:05:48.917
<i>Disable their communication
and transportation.</i>

1886
02:05:49.917 --> 02:05:53.292
<i>Make the target as deaf, dumb
and paralyzed as possible,</i>

1887
02:05:53.375 --> 02:05:55.458
<i>setting them up for the second stage.</i>

1888
02:05:56.042 --> 02:05:58.042
Synchronized chaos.

1889
02:05:58.125 --> 02:06:02.042
<i>Terrorize them with covert attacks
and misinformation,</i>

1890
02:06:02.125 --> 02:06:03.958
<i>overwhelming their defense capabilities</i>

1891
02:06:04.042 --> 02:06:08.125
<i>leaving their weapon systems vulnerable
to extremists and their own military.</i>

1892
02:06:08.208 --> 02:06:12.292
<i>Without a clear enemy or motive,
people would start turning on each other.</i>

1893
02:06:15.417 --> 02:06:19.375
If done successfully,
the third stage would happen on its own.

1894
02:06:21.625 --> 02:06:23.042
What's the third stage?

1895
02:06:27.833 --> 02:06:28.833
Coup d'état.

1896
02:06:31.542 --> 02:06:32.542
Civil war.

1897
02:06:36.542 --> 02:06:37.542
Collapse.

1898
02:06:43.542 --> 02:06:46.125
This program was considered
the most cost-effective way

1899
02:06:46.208 --> 02:06:47.958
to destabilize a country.

1900
02:06:49.167 --> 02:06:52.083
Because if the target nation
was dysfunctional enough,

1901
02:06:52.167 --> 02:06:54.833
it would, in essence, do the work for you.

1902
02:07:01.208 --> 02:07:03.833
