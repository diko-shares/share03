23

{\an8}-Not at all.
-So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

24
00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:15.158
{\an8}Well, the premise is quite simple.

25
00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.662
{\an8}Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

26
00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.165
{\an8}...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

27
00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:23.959
{\an8}-We're talking about a virus?
-Yes.

28
00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:25.919
{\an8}In this case, the measles virus...

29
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:31.258
{\an8}...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

30
00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:34.720
{\an8}Um, I'm not--I find the best way
to describe it is...

31
00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:37.389
{\an8}...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

32
00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:42.436
{\an8}...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

33
00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:45.647
{\an8}...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

34
00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:49.109
{\an8}But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

35
00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:52.613
{\an8}...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

36
00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.073
{\an8}Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

37
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.869

in humans so far.

38
00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:02.789

-Ten thousand and nine.

39
