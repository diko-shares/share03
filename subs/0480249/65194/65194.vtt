Ladies and gentlemen, step up.

Step up.

I, Mercury, the messenger of the gods,

invite you... invite you, sir,

13
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,500
tonight, for one night only,

14
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,200
here, at this very venue, to enter into the mind,

15
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,200
the very great mind...

16
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
...of Doctor Parnassus.

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Doctor Parnassus!

Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
Doctor Parnassus, as old...

19
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
as old as time. Yes.

20
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,500
He is over a thousand years old.

21
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,500
He has the power
to empower your mind.

22
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,600
Let Doctor Parnassus open your imagination.

23
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,900

Oh, my God. Oh, check out the lights.

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,900
Transcend the heights on Beauty's wing.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Whoa, whoa!

28

Dave, Dave, haway.
Come on, we'll go get these sorted.

Check this out, sweetheart.

Come here, my love, near me.

32
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,300
Come on, love.

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400

scour the squalid depths

37
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,700
with Putrid's brother, Stench...

38
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,900

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,900
Raaaa!

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,300
Join the queue.

41
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,700
Only five quid a go.

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,400
Bang. Bang.

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,600
(Cheering)

44
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,200
You choose... you choose...
you choose fulfilment?

45
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,900
- Whoa!
- Sir, please... Sir, please, if you will...

46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,700
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,400
Sir, please, you cannot audition
without a ticket, I'm afraid, sir.

48
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,900
- Give us a kiss.
- Please don't.

49
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,500
- Hey...
- You all right down there, mate?

50
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,700
- All right, Captain Planet?
- Get off the stage, you damn drunk.

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
What are you doing, little man?

52
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,600
He's got us by the leg.

53

54
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,900
Ha-hey!

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,900
Hey, man, check it out.
It's not even real.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,900
Hey!

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,100
Get off the stage!

58
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,500
- Mm, that's a nice pair of tits.
- I said, get off the stage!

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
Nah.

60

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,300
What are you running away for?

65

(Friend cheers)

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,300

69
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,900
Oh, shite.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,300
I'm coming after...

71
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,300
I'm gonna feel your arse.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,900
Come back, you bitch!

75

76
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,400
(lrish accent) Me nose!

77
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,300
Ohhh...

78
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,700
Oh, my face!

79
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,700
My face! My gorgeous face!

80
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,600

81
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,600

82
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,200
Martin!

83
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,000
He went with that cow!

84
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,400
- I'll scratch her eyes out!
- Oi, you two.

85
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,300
My boyfriend is in there!

86
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,300
Anybody there?

87
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,600
Anybody there?

88
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,900
Please, is anybody there?

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,100
Please! Please!

90
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000

92
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,100
(Whispers) Mum!

93
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,800
Aaargh!

94
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,100
Help me!

95
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,100
(Creature chatters)

96
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,700
Please...

97
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
I'll never drink again. I promise.

98
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,400
Honest.

99
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,500
From now on, I swear, not a drop.

100
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,500
Oh, really?

101
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,500
(Approaching scream)

102
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,300
Whoo!

103
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
PARNASSUS:
<i>You have chosen well</i>.

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,500
<i>The path to Parnassus is steep</i>.

105
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,500
<i>The way is long</i>.

106
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
<i>But with perseverance,</i>

107
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,700
<i>and fierce dedication,</i>

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,300
<i>- the heights are attainable</i>.
- (Piano music)

109
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,000
<i>So with spirits high</i>
<i>and a spring in your step,</i>

110
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,200
<i>with a song in your heart,</i>

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,700
<i>the clouds will part,</i>

112
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400
<i>the heavens will open</i>

113
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,300
<i>and you will be a man, my son</i>.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,200
Hi there. Come on in.

115
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,300
Looks like you could use a drink.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
Maybe just the one.

117
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,500
Hey!

118
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,700
Make mine a double!

119
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,400
Oh!

120
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,400
He won, I lost.

121
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,000
I lost again.

122
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,500
- What were you doing?
- He was chasing me.

123
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,200
- What was I supposed to...
- Don't go through the mirror.

124
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,000
- Never. You know that.
MAN: Oi, you!

125
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,300
Gunga Din.

126
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,300
Come 'ere.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,500
What do you think you're playing at?

128
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,300
Playing? Oh, no, no, no.

129
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,700
We don't play.

130
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,900
What we do is deadly serious.

131
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,500
Gone.

132
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,800
Will we miss him? I don't think so.

133
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Don't worry
if you don't understand it all immediately.

134
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,800
Right, look,
I want you freaks out of here, now.

135
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,800
Ow!

136
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,100
Sorry, I didn't mean to use that word.
All right? Vertically deficient.

137
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,900
Defunct?

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,900
Vertically d...

139
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Vertically challenged. Vertically...

140
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,900
Vertically challenged. Whatever you are,
get off of my beat or I will do you.

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,700
- You included.
- D'accord. D'accord.

142
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,100
- Who threw that?
- Bonne nuit.

143
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,500
You're nicked.

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,700
(Excited screams)

145
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,600
Take a ticket. Wait your turn.

146
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,200
Only 20 quid a go.

147
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,800
Reduced to five for one night only.

148
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
this world, this world that we live in...

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
is full of enchantment...

150
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,900
for those with eyes to see it.

151
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,200
Chicken!

152
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,100
(Squawks)

153
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
I want to go there, there and there.

154
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
- I want something to eat.
- Stop going on.

155
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,000
MAN:
No. They won't let you, darling.

156
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,700
But I want to, I want to.

157
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
- Linda!
- You never let me...

158
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Excuse me. Excuse me.

159
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,300
(Sighs)

160
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,500
Do you mind?

161
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,500
(Gasps)

162
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,900
Anton.

163
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,800
Anton, he went back there.

164
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,800
- Just go and er...
- I'm going to go back. Ssh.

165
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,100
BOY'S PARENTS:
Diego! Diego!

166
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,700
Die.

167

Yes.

Yeah!

174
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,700
If one of you perverts has got our boy,
I won't be answerable for my actions.

175
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,500
- Diego!
- Diego!

176
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,900

W-What?

179

- She's not looking for him.
- I don't care!

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
Hello.

181
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,100
Voilà.

182
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,500
- Yeah!
- Oh, it worked!

183
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,900
Where have you been? I've been worried sick.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,500
One little devil out of the fire...

185
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,400
Wipe that silly expression off your face,
you little poof. Get up.

186
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,300
The astounding world of Doctor Parnassus.
Thank you.

187
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,100
- Anton?
- Yes, sir.

188
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,300
- You know the rules about the mirror?
- Yes, I do. I'm sorry, sir. I'm really...

189
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,100
- He was a ten-year-old boy.
- I know.

190
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,900
You did well, my boy. You did well.

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,900
Good lad. Good lad.

192
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,200
Thank you.

193
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,800
- Good lad. Good lad.
- Thank you.

194
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
You go through the mirror
and he's all over you.

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,100
I do it once and he serves you
my head on a plate.

196
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,700
Come on now, Valentina.
You're his daughter.

197
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,400
Do you know what I mean?
And you're scrumptious...

198
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,800
(Whispers) His scrumptious daughter.

199
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,800
Why did I say "scrumptious"?

200
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,900
Beautiful.

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,900
Intelligent. Sweet.

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
"Scrumptious"? Idiot!

203
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,700
(Mutters softly)

204
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,500
Hey, Parny.

205
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,700
It's been a while.

206
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,600
ANTON:
Whoa... Last call.

207
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,000
- Hey, Anton.
- Yes, Percy?

208
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,100
- What did I say?
- Stop Percying about.

209
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
We don't have all night.

210
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,900
Bloody kids again.

211
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,900
- What's up, Doc?
- Hey!

212
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
Don't we love our children?

213
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,900
She's ripe as a peach.

214
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,100
Sweet little 16.

215
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,000
And all mine!

216
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,300
He's come to collect.

217
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,000
I thought so.

218
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,600
He's early.

219
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,500
What can I do?

220
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,000
Nothing.

221
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,900
There must be something.

222
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,300
How many days left?

223
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,300
Three.

224
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,400
You know, you're gonna have to tell her soon.

225
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,300
♪ When the moon hits your eye
like a big pizza pie

226
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,100
♪ That's amore...

227
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,100
Will you shut up about food?

228
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,700
We're plum out. And I'm starving.

229
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,500
Oh, Percy, we've still got
a couple of potatoes left.

230
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,500
(Anton hums)

231
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,100
- Ooh, look at this.
- Hey, that's mine.

232
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,900
Oh, won't you look at that? That is...

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,800
- That's private!
- It's gorgeous.

234
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,500
- Give it.
- All that mahogany, oh!

235
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,300
- Anton!
- (Chuckles)

236
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,700
Would you really be happy in a place like that?

237
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,900
Would you?

238
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,200
I wouldn't. I couldn't do it, I don't think.

239
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,100
Well, maybe if I was with you.

240
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,500
Ah-ah!

241
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,300
Sssh.

242
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,100
You're always talking about escaping,
aren't you?

243
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,700
Always thinking about it.
Always dreaming about it.

244
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,100
Let's do it.

245
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,500
- Why not? You and me.
- I can't run away.

246
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,700
- You and me.
- We can't run away. I can't.

247
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,500
I'm underage.

248
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,400
Oh, don't do that.

249
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,300
I shall be 12 on Wednesday.

250
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Don't be ridiculous.

251
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,100
Percy, how old will I be on Wednesday?

252
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,900
12.

253
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,700
Ha! See?

254
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,200
Parnassus says so too.

255
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,200
- Are you trying to say he's ridiculous?
- No.

256
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,500
Actually,

257
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,100
I'm really going to be 16.

258
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,000
Sweet 16.

259
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,200
The age of consent.

260
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
(Small bells tinkling)

261
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,400
Is that you, Scrumpy?

262
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Who the hell else is it gonna be?

263
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Oi, you haven't eaten any of this!

264
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
- Yes, I know, I know.
- And that again?

265
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,800
For God's sakes, Dad! Put 'em up.

266
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,500
Come on. You're always taking
the easy way out.

267
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,500
No, no. Not now, Scrumpy. Not now.

268
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,300
I have something very important
that I have to tell you.

269
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,700
Oh, why does everybody
want to live forever?

270
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,600
Lmmortality is a bloody curse.

271
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,500
So is pretending to be a 12-year-old child,
damn it.

272
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,200
Look at me. I mean...

273
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,700
Look at me. Nobody's fooled.

274
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,100
And I want this stupid thing off my ankle too,
while we're at it.

275
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,900
You can't stop me growing up
just by lying about my birthday.

276
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,100
Shut up and listen to me!

277
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,200
I have to explain something to you
before it's too late.

278
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,900
One winter night...

279
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,100
- Is this gonna take long?
- Yes, yes, yes, quite possibly.

280
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Many years ago...

281
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,600
Er... many centuries ago, in fact,

282
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,300
when I was - believe it or not -
a young monk,

283
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,100
someone visited me in my sanctuary,

284
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,600
someone I had hoped never to meet.

285
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,100
Someone...

286
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,600
...none of us should ever hope to meet.

287
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,900
(Horse whinnies)

288
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,600
(Monks chanting)

289
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Having captured the wind,

290
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,600
tamed the storm,

291
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,100
kept the stars in their orbits
and the earth turning on its axis,

292
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,400
the Chief Steward,
lying down to take his rest,

293
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,200
had a most disturbing dream.

294
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,300
He dreamt that a hooded rider
was fast approaching on the snowswept plain.

295
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,300
The Chief Steward woke.

296
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,200
(Door rattles)

297
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,100
(Deep rumbling)

298
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,900
(Hinges creaking)

299
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,700
(Wind howls)

300
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,800
PERCY: And so the Steward set out
on his great journey...

301
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,700
- What exactly do you all do here?
- We tell the eternal story.

302
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,500
And what is that, exactly?

303
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
The story that sustains the universe.

304
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,000
The story without which there is nothing.

305
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,500
Nothing?

306
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,500
You mean...

307
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,700
stop telling the story
and the whole universe ceases to exist?

308
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,600
You make it sound so simple.

309
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,000
And you believe it?

310
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,700
We are ordained for this task.

311
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,900
(Chuckles) It's just incredible to me,

312
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,500
that you can believe something
that can be so easily disproved.

313
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,500
Oh, I don't think so.

314
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,200
Hm.

315
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,900
We'll see.

316
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,100
PERCY: I will gather a thousand...
- So.

317
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,200
(High-pitched whine)

318
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
Stop!

319
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,900
...having been brought to the limit
of his endurance...

320
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,000
Yet the forces of evil could not prevail...

321
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,300
(Whining continues)

322
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,200
...our calmness of...

323
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,700
There.

324
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
The story stopped.

325
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,500
No more story.

326
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,400
But we're still here.

327
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,100
The fire's still burning.

328
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,600
It's still snowing. The wind's still blowing.

329
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,500
Nothing has changed.

330
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,200
Come on, cheer up, Doc.

331
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,000
I've freed you from
all this ridiculous nonsense.

332
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,700
Now you can do other things with your powers.

333
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,300
You can erm...

334
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,300
I dunno, you can go shopping.

335
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,500
Have fun.

336
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,600
You can learn a foreign language or...
or go on a cruise.

337
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,100
(Chuckles)

338
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,800
God!

339
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,400
- (Screeches)
- Damn it!

340
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,600
(Laughs)

341
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,500
A sign, a message.

342
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,800
That bird was a messenger...

343
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,400
from some distant place
that we know nothing of.

344
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,100
Oh, I see it all now,

345
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,800
so clear.

346
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,800
This has nothing to do with us here.

347
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,000
Somewhere in this world, right now,

348
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,500
someone else is telling a story.

349
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,300
A different story - a saga or romance,

350
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,700
a tale of unforeseen death - it doesn't matter.

351
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,600
It's sustaining the universe.

352
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,300
That's why we're still here.

353
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,100
You can't stop stories being told.

354
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,100
That's a weak hypothesis.

355
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,100
I don't think so.

356
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,700
Say, you're probably not a betting man,
are you?

357
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,500
What?

358
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,900
And that was my first wager with the Devil.

359
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,500
You see, the very first of us to...

360
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,200
...attract 12 disciples would win the bet.

361
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,200
His argument:

362
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,100
The necessities of danger, of fear,
of the fabled bliss of ignorance.

363
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,200
Mine:

364
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,000
The power of the imagination
to transform and illuminate our lives.

365
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,500
It was a hard fight but I won.

366
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,500
(Chuckles)

367
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,000
My prize?

368
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,100
The one thing I coveted most -
everlasting life.

369
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,900
Huh.

370
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,900
Everlasting torment.

371
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,400
He tricked me. He let me win.

372
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,700
He knew that times would change.

373
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And that one day,
no-one would want my stories.

374
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,300
<i>This was the price of my arrogance</i>.

375
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,500
<i>Forgotten, lost, alone</i>.

376
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,200
<i>Desperate</i>.

377
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,900
(Carriage rattles, horse whinnies)

378
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,500
We've stopped.

379
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,500
Go on with your story.

380
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,300
No, another time.

381
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,700
Something's happened.
You'd better go and see.

382
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,900
Why do you always do this?
You always stop in the middle of your stories.

383
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,200
(Thunder rumbles)

384
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,800
Valentina, come here.
Valentina, come here.

385
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,600
I just saw someone...
someone dancing on the water.

386
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,900
I swear. I swear.

387
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,400
When the lightning flashed,
there was a shadow...

388
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
...thrown from those pillars over there.

389
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,400
Do you see that?
Do you see the dancer?

390
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,700
- Yeah, he's river dancing.
- Yeah, he's river dancing. See that?

391
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,400
VALENTINA:
That's someone hanging!

392
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,100
He must be under this bridge.

393
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,800
Hanging?

394
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,300
Get a rope.

395
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,700
If he's hanging by his neck,
he's already got a rope.

396
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,900
- Get a rope!
- OK.

397
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,600
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly!
Percy, Percy! Christ!

398
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,500
(Thunder rumbles)

399
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,900
All right, all right.

400
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
OK, lower, lower, lower. All right.

401
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,400
Stop, stop!

402
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,300
Jesus. Agh. All right. OK.

403
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,100
OK. OK.

404
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,300
OK.

405
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,000
No, I can't... I can't reach him.

406
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,000
Hold on, I'll swing you.

407
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,500
I'm gonna swing you in.

408
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,100
All right, try again.

409
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,500
Whoaagh!

410
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,500
Again, up.

411
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,400
Yes.

412
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,900
(Grunts)

413
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
I've got him.

414
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,300
Oh, my God, what am I doing? Oh, my God!

415
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,200
Sir, are you all right?

416
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,100
OK, I've got you here.

417
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,100
Get in there.

418
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,100
OK, put your arms round me.
Put your arms round me. Oh, jeez!

419
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,400
OK.

420
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,100
All right.

421
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,400
Come on. Stay with me, mate.

422
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,300
Aarrghh!

423
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,800
You've done it. Brilliant!

424
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
- OK, pull him up.
- Pull me up!

425
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,600
Jesus Christ!

426
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,900
(Anton yells)

427
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,300
Whoagh!

428
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,900
- Are you OK?
- Oh, God!

429
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,100
Why are you fishing dead people
out of the river?

430
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,100
Leave him be, for the love of God!

431
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,300
He's dead!

432
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,900
Let's get the hell out of here
before the fuzz turns up.

433
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,300
Anton, help me.

434
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,400
- Help her.
- All right, I've got him.

435
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,100
Watch your head.

436
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,100
Pull him this way.

437
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,500
No, no, no, Val. It's not gonna work.

438
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,400
It's not gonna work. Watch out.

439
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
You don't know where he's been, anyway.

440
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,500
Ready? All clear?

441
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,400
Ohh!

442
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,700
Oh!

443
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,700
- He's alive!
- He was.

444
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,300
What on earth is that?

445
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,100
- We'll put him in the trunk.
- But...

446
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
- What?
- The boss said leave him.

447
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,900
He thought he was dead. Come on.

448
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,100
No, no, no. I don't like this.

449
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,500
This just doesn't...
It's none of our business.

450
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,500
What do you suggest, that we leave
him on the side of the road?

451
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,500
Definitely. Let's go.

452
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,900
All right.

453
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,900
Careful.

454
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,900
PERCY: Anton, come on!
- Percy!

455
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,900
Percy, you dropped these.

456
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,200
PERCY: Giddy up!

457
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,200
Val! Val, come on!

458
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,900
Jump up.

459
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,900
(Grunts)

460
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,900
(Groans)

461
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,800
(Gasps)

462
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,200
(Coughs)

463
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,600
Hey, you!

464
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,600
I suppose somebody saves your life
every day of the week.

465
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,200
What?

466
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,600
Is it too much of a bother for a mere thank you?

467
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,200
Who are you?

468
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,000
Percival St Antoine della Touraine
et Sansepolcro da Piemonte III.

469
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,900
And if that seems too difficult,
you can call me Percy.

470
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,400
Where the hell are we?

471
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,800
Geographically, in the northern hemisphere,
socially, on the margins,

472
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,800
and narratively, with some way to go.

473
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,300
And your name is?

474
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,900
Uh...

475
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,500
I can't remember.

476
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,300
That's frigging handy!

477
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,300
Any credit cards?

478
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
Are you trying to rob me?

479
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,600
What are you doing?

480
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,600
With your name on them.

481
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,600
Oh, right, er...

482
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,300
Where's my wallet? Where's my phone?
What have you done with it?

483
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,300
- Don't look at us.
- Who are you?

484
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,500
He doesn't remember.

485
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,200
Listen, er... whoever you people are,
and whatever it is you get up to,

486
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,500
I'm cool with it.

487
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,700
I won't tell anyone about it and er...

488
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,300
I'm gonna go now, all right?

489
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,500
(Musical ringtone)

490
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,700
It's probably for you.

491
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,800
Oh.

492
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,300
Here's my phone.

493
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,000
WOMAN:
<i>There you are</i>.

494
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,500
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

495
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,400
<i>(Woman speaks Russian)</i>

496
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,500
Pity.

497
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,100
I speak Russian.

498
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,600
Oh, hello.

499
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,200
Are you all right?

500
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,900
Yeah.

501
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,900
Yeah, it's just I feel...

502
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,200
I think I need a place to gather
my thoughts for a little bit.

503
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,900
Sorry, mate. Sorry, mate.

504
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,900
Thank you for that but you can't stay.

505
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,300
- Why not?
- (Coughs)

506
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,200
What do you mean? Look at him.

507
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,200
We... We don't know who he is.

508
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,900
We don't know what he's done.

509
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,100
Listen, I haven't done anything, mate.

510
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,700
- All right?
- Oh, right.

511
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,600
I understand where you're coming from,
but understand where I'm coming from.

512
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,700
I don't know my name.
You know, I don't know how I got here.

513
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,800
I don't know who you are or who she is,
and I certainly don't know what that is.

514
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,300
You know?

515
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,300
The last thing I remember
is being whacked in the head,

516
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,400
waking up in that box, in the back of this...
whatever the hell this thing is.

517
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,300
And I just... I just...

518
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,000
(Coughs)

519
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,500
(Groans) Oh, my head!

520
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,100
What the hell's going on here?

521
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,700
I told you to leave him. He was dead.

522
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,500
Well, he isn't and we didn't.

523
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,800
ANTON: We found him hanging
under the bridge, sir.

524
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,400
- Hanging?
- Yeah.

525
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,500
By his neck till dead, if we had any sense.

526
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,800
We found these in his pockets. Two of these.

527
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,000
The Hanged Man.

528
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,900
Scrumpy, get out of my way.

529
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,400
No.

530
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,400
Signs are all clear.

531
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,700
And those marks!

532
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,900
- I recognise them.
- What marks?

533
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,800
You've been sent by Mr Nick, haven't you?

534
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,700
- Mr Nick?
- I knew it. You know his name.

535
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,500
No.

536
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,800
He's got a proposition for me, hasn't he?

537
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,700
A new wager, perhaps,

538
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,500
or another twist in the game?

539
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,700
He can't help himself, can he?

540
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,100
Thank God! Thank God for that!

541
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
VALENTINA:
Dad says you should work.

542
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,500
Help focus your mind.

543
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,100
I don't know,
it might bring your memory back.

544
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,000
Ah, here we are. Try this.

545
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,700
Thanks.

546
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,400
(Gramophone plays)

547
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,200
You can help out front.

548
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,500
Sell tickets or something like that.

549
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,100
What do you think?

550
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,500
Hm?

551
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,600
OK.

552
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,100
So... no name

553
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
and now no face?

554
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,500
The mystery thickens.

555
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,500
PARNASSUS:
Get your grubby hands...

556
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,700
All right. That's not necessary.

557
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,100
- Valentina, we got a problem.
- So strange.

558
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,000
Just a complete blank, you know.

559
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,200
PARNASSUS:
I can dress myself.

560
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,100
Let me go, I said!

561
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,600
Let me go!

562
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,600
(Needle scratches on record)

563
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,500
Ow. Hey, come on.

564
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,500
Doctor.

565
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,900
Oh, God, he's gonna be sick.

566
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,900
Aha!

567
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,100
Is your memory less impaired?

568
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,000
Is it all coming back to you now?

569
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,500
What?

570
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,300
Ah, you're bloody useless.
You're a flaming disaster.

571
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,200
You can't go on. You're drunk.

572
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,300
I'm not drunk! I'm grumpy... Scrumpy.

573
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,900
(Clattering)

574
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,700
Er...

575
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,700
(Mutters softly)

576
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,900
ANTON:
L-L-Ladies and gentlemen,

577
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,900
raise your sights for one night only.

578
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,600
Encounter...

579
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,500
Percy, where's George gone?

580
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,700
...the majesty, the beauty,
the miracle that's in each...

581
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,500
- (Percy blows raspberry)
- Anton, where's George?

582
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,000
Who... Who's George?

583
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,000
I thought we should give him a name.

584
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,800
All right, that's cute.

585
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,300
Saint George, in fact. To be precise.
Well, hello there, darling.

586
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,800
Oh, that's a lovely scarf.
It matches those lovely eyes of yours.

587
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,900
Well, actually, I'm here to sell a show.
Want to see a magic show?

588
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Thank God for that. Not a single customer.

589
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,900
- I'm closing up.
- Let's do that.

590
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,400
- He's never not done a show before.
- (Whistling)

591
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,200
- All right.
- N-n-n-no.

592
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,200
No, what are you doing?

593
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,700
I'm doing my job, mate.
Now, come on, do yours.

594
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,400
Do yours. Go juggle.
You're doing your thing, you look beautiful.

595
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,900
OK. Ladies and...

596
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,500
Well, ladies.

597
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,700
I am very proud to present to you
the one, the only, the extraordinary...

598
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,700
Doctor Parnassus.

599
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,600
(Drunkenly) ♪ I'm a little teapot short and stout

600
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,500
♪ Here's my handle and here's my spout...

601
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,500
- Urgh!
- (Needle scratches on record)

602
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,600
Dad?

603
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,500
This man is drunk!

604
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,700
- Dead drunk!
- Oh, that's disgraceful!

605
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,900
- He's not drunk.
- No, he's not. He's...

606
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,900
- Got a bad cold.
- And you know what?

607
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,100
Despite that, he still went on,
for his audience, for you...

608
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,100
at considerable risk for his health.

609
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,900
And I think that is worthy of a round of applause,
ladies and gentlemen.

610
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,100
- What a man.
- We want our money back.

611
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,600
Every penny.

612
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,500
Well, you...

613
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,100
All right, listen.
You can have your money back.

614
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,500
I understand, but I... Listen.

615
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,100
To tell you the truth, the Doctor's daughter...

616
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,300
I know she looks pretty but she ain't...

617
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,000
She's pretty sick, see?

618
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,900
She needs surgery.

619
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,300
So we're trying to scrounge
all we can get. Otherwise she's gonna...

620
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,200
That's what all this is about -
to try and get money for her.

621
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,100
Do you understand? I mean...

622
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,500
How about this?

623
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,300
We'll give you a free ticket -
no, two free tickets -

624
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,300
if you buy another one at half price.

625
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,600
Er... this offer's only available today.

626
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,000
All right, go on.

627
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,400
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

628
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,500
(Mimics Valentina)
This offer is only available today.

629
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,900
- He took all that?
- Yeah.

630
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,900
Have you ever seen so much?

631
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,900
ANTON: That is what lying
through your teeth can get you.

632
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,900
Come on, Anton.

633
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,900
How was he to know that
we're not gonna be here tomorrow?

634
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,400
Hey, maybe my birthday won't be so bad.

635
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,300
Yeah, maybe it won't, actually.

636
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,700
Maybe with George here,
maybe you could get out of this dump.

637
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,300
Go find your ideal home.

638
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,400
Anton.

639
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,900
(Horse whinnies)

640
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,600
George! Wrong end of the horse, mate.

641
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,600
What's the...

642
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,600
(Parnassus groans)

643
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,700
I should be dead.

644
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,200
(Alarm rings)

645
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,300
(Ping)

646
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,700
- (Groans)
- You know, you shouldn't drink.

647
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,100
It just flat out doesn't agree with you.

648
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,600
You are so right.

649
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,500
- (Fly buzzing)
- You?

650
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,300
Oh, shit.

651
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,700
Oh, well, what do you want from me this time?
I'll do anything.

652
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,100
I know you will.

653
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,400
By the way, your man lost his memory.

654
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,200
Bloody useless.

655
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,500
- He's not my man.
- What?

656
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,400
No. He's a little toerag named Tony Shepherd.

657
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,100
Just tidying up.

658
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,100
He runs a big charity.

659
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,100
I don't trust him.

660
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,100
- But you don't trust me either, do you?
- Oh, just tell me what you want.

661
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,500
I just thought that last night
when you were so upset

662
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,000
that you could maybe use
a little glimmer of hope.

663
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,600
Maybe you could use a little bet.

664
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,600
What?

665
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,100
It's over, it's over. Finito.

666
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,500
Oh, come on, it's never over.

667
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,800
Come on, what have you got to lose?
Look, you could end up winning.

668
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,800
You could save her.

669
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,100
What do you say? First to five souls?

670
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,900
- First to five?
- Yeah.

671
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,300
No tricks?

672
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,000
- No.
- No, no cheating?

673
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,000
No cheating.

674
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,500
I'd say yes. Deal.

675
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,100
God, I love a betting man.

676
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,200
OK, by her birthday, then.

677
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,700
That's in two days, you bastard.

678
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,200
Do you have any idea
what rotten business we're doing?

679
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,900
Things are gonna pick up.
Sure as eggs is eggs.

680
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,100
- Yeah.
- OK.

681
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,100
- First one to five souls wins.
- I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.

682
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,100
Now that I'd like to see.

683
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,700
Wait!

684
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,700
(Clatter)

685
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,100
Oh!

686
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,100
(Chickens clucking)

687
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,900
(Groans)

688
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,700
Damn phone.

689
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,300
- Morning, Val.
- Hi, George.

690
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,500
Scrumpy?

691
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,900
Scrumpy?

692
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,500
Oh... (Mutters)

693
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,500
Oh.

694
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,100
Good lord. (Tuts)

695
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,600
Good lord.

696
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,700
(Snap)

697
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,600
- Food, food. We got food.
- (Bicycle bell)

698
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,600
We got bread. We got cheese.
We got vegetables.

699
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,300
And we got... this thing.
Whatever this thing is.

700
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,900
It's all your fault we're eating so well today.

701
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,700
Know how to pluck?

702
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,300
Is that... is that... Bertie?

703
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,500
George thought doves would be better.

704
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,900
- Pluck it.
- Pluck it?

705
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,600
- Yeah.
- How?

706
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,500
Here.

707
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
That was my best trick.

708
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,500
Five souls in two days, huh?

709
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,400
Put a sock in it. I'm trying to think.

710
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,700
He's been sent to us for a reason. I know it.

711
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,600
- Cards don't lie.
- No?

712
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,200
Pardonnez-moi.
Monsieur Saint George.

713
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Oh, I worry about you.

714
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,900
Not knowing who you are.

715
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,300
It must be extrêmement difficile
pour vous, n'est-ce pas?

716
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,500
Yeah, it really is. It's confusing at times.

717
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,200
- I may be able to help you.
- Really?

718
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,000
Yes. You see this contraption here?

719
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,900
Do the honours, Percy.

720
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,900
Yes.
Now, if you don't mind placing it on your head.

721
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,200
- That's it. Now, you see these wires?
- Yes.

722
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,800
Just hold on to that. That's right.

723
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,300
- All right.
- That's right, now.

724
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,200
Now, I just want you to relax.
And just think of nothing.

725
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,100
That's not gonna be hard considering...

726
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,000
- Shut it!
- I beg your pardon?

727
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,300
Your mouth. Don't breathe.

728
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,000
- Hold your breath.
- Seriously?

729
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Just let the energy flow.
Let it wax and wane.

730
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,800
Think of the earth, the ocean...

731
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,100
That's very good. Very good, very good.

732
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yes. I need a name.

733
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,500
I need a name. Huh?

734
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,000
Yes, I have a name.

735
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,700
Shepherd.

736
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,700
(Exhales)

737
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,700
Anthony Shepherd.

738
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,000
They call you Tony.

739
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,500
That was exhausting.

740
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,400
You used to do good works, I understand.

741
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,200
Erm... something about a charity,

742
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,100
I think.

743
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,500
Yes. Erm...

744
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,200
Tony Shepherd...

745
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,500
It rings a bell for sure.

746
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,700
Wow. This...

747
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,100
This... this... It really works.

748
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,000
You erm...

749
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,300
Is there anything else you discovered
when you were doing your "ums"...?

750
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,700
Well, I mean...

751
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,100
You must understand
this is an ancient technique.

752
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,400
- Right.
- I'm extremely rusty, I'm afraid.

753
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,200
(Both laugh)

754
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,200
No. There was absolutely nothing else.

755
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,600
No.

756
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,800
Well, it's fascinating stuff.

757
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,100
It really is, I must say.
I mean, can I take this off now?

758
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,000
- Yes.
- Is that all right?

759
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,700
- I mean, thank you very much.
- No, no. Not at all. Not at all.

760
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,600
Bless you. I have a name.

761
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,500
Charity work?

762
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,700
Cool.

763
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,500
So what was he doing
dangling by his neck under the bridge?

764
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,100
Percy!

765
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,700
Is that rude? Did I put my foot in it?

766
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,200
(Blows raspberry)

767
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,800
No, it's erm... so strange.
It's horrible, you know?

768
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,400
I just...
Everything is just a complete blank.

769
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,800
You know? But as the good doctor said, I...

770
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,000
I was involved in some sort of charity.
I do remember that.

771
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,900
There you go. Plucked.

772
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,100
I mean, what a fool I must have been,
you know, to think that I could have...

773
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,700
- you know, changed the world.
- (Pipe plays)

774
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,900
That I could have made a difference.
You know, given people hope, eh?

775
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,500
I mean, what an arrogant idiot I must have...

776
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,800
Hey! What's that?
Can I have a look at that?

777
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,400
- What is that you've got?
- It's Beethoven, Ode To Joy.

778
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,800
No, not the song, mate. The pipe.

779
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,800
- Oh...
- I think it belongs to me.

780
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,600
- Really? You think...?
- Yeah.

781
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,200
How do you... how do you know that?
You remembered you're a musician.

782
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah, it's a day of remembering.
Can I please have it back?

783
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,300
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

784
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,800
You're sure this is yours?

785
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,100
- Positive, mate.
- How can you be sure?

786
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,700
I just know these things.
Can I have it back, please?

787
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,500
Yeah. All right, then. Here you go.

788
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,100
- Er...
- Er...

789
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,500
- (Laughs)
- Yeah.

790
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,800
- Yeah...
- All right.

791
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,400
- I don't know where it's gone.
- It's very funny, isn't it?

792
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,400
Can I have my pipe back?
It means a lot to me.

793
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
- Yeah, I understand.
- It's a special pipe.

794
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,400
I don't quite know...
OK, sorry. Got it, got it. Sorry.

795
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,700
There you go. Take it.

796
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,600
- Sorry, sorry.
- Thanks.

797
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,700
Listen, this isn't funny, mate.
That pipe means a lot to me.

798
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,600
- All right?
- It's a little bit funny.

799
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,000
- No, it's not. Get my pipe back.
- All right.

800
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,000
Let me just look around.

801
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,200
What is it doing in a teapot?

802
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,100
That's what I want to know.

803
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,100
- What is it doing in a teapot?
- I don't know.

804
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,800
- Now, thank you very much.
- OK.

805
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,500
- All right. I'm just mucking about.
- All right.

806
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,900
Right! Now you go fetch that thing.

807
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,700
- No, I'm not kidding. Get that thing.
- OK.

808
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,400
- I'm gonna get it.
- Right now.

809
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,600
All right. Just chill out. Just chill out.

810
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,400
There.

811
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,900
Anton. Enough.

812
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,700
I'm sorry. I'm playing around, trying to bond.

813
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,300
Thanks, darling.

814
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,300
Just trying to bond.

815
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,600
OK.

816
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,000
- That was fun!
- Yeah. Funny, funny.

817
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,100
- (Horse whinnies)
- We'll take this one to the back.

818
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm worried about Anton.
What's eating him?

819
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,200
He's in love with Valentina.

820
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,100
In love? Who gave him permission?

821
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,300
- It happens.
- The little snake.

822
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,400
Take him from the streets
and that's the thanks I get. I'll skin him alive.

823
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
While you're at it, there's the other one.

824
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,500
- The other one?
- The rattlesnake.

825
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,800
- The forgetful cobra.
- Oh, Tony?

826
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,600
- Tony's another kettle of fish.
- Is he?

827
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,200
Yes, he's ambitious, energetic.
A man of destiny.

828
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,300
- And he'll help us win.
- I think he just might.

829
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,200
(Scoffs)

830
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,600
- Scrumpy sees some good in him.
- She's better off with Anton.

831
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,500
Perhaps I should offer her hand

832
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,700
to whoever helps us win
the next five souls.

833
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,700
That's an even worse idea
than all the other bad ones you've had today.

834
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,600
You're not wrong, you're not wrong.
Neither of them is worthy of her.

835
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,600
You're never wrong, are you?

836
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,700
(Chuckles) Percy.
What would I do without you?

837
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,200
- Get a midget.
- What?

838
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,900
You know, short fellow.
A little taller than I am.

839
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,400
Short legs, short feet, big head.
Runs kind of funny.

840
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,300
Yes, I know, I know.

841
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,400
Doctor Parnassus...
as old as the universe itself.

842
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
- Versed in...
- Ah, evening, smokers.

843
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,600
Hello, hello, hello.
How's your night tonight? Is it good?

844
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,400
- (Laughter)
- Is it all right? Had a few pints?

845
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,300
- Let the mind...
- Is he OK?

846
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,200
...of the great Dr Parnassus...

847
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,200
What are you doing,
sniffing about like that?

848
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,300
We must concentrate tonight.
Everything depends on it.

849
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,300
(Clash of cymbals)

850
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,300
(Gramophone plays)

851
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,500
(Laughter)

852
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,500
Let the great mind... of this doctor...

853
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,200
- (Laughter)
...transport you...

854
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,800
...to the world of your imagination.

855
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,100
(Laughter)

856
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,600
You, my dear,
I see having a very special destiny.

857
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,800
Procrastinate no longer,
you stupid ponce.

858
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,000
Procrastinate no longer.

859
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,400
Oh, no, no, no, a singer.
I bet you have the voice...

860
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,600
- Hi there!
...of an angel.

861
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,100
Don't you, now? Now, come on,
trust me, you're gonna love this experience.

862
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,200
Hey, what are you doing?

863
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,800
Taking you to the heart
of your imagination.

864
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,100
Oh, my God. No way.

865
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,100
Trust me, you will not regret this.

866
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,800
- Go for it, Sal.
- Yeah, go for it, Sal.

867
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:56,000
- Only if she comes too.
- Now you're talking.

868
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,000
- I can't do two at the same time.
- Are you crazy, kid? Go for it.

869
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,000
- Well, I'm not going on my own.
- We'll do it together.

870
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,700
- Together. Good idea.
- Are you crazy?

871
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,500
Two imaginations in there at the same time?

872
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Oh, no, no, no. Ladies, ladies, ladies.

873
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,800
One at a time's fine, you see.

874
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,100
When there are two, the stronger
imagination will overcome the weaker

875
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,900
and you have no idea what might happen.

876
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,600
- That's really stupid.
- One alone is safe. Follow me.

877
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,500
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Let go!

878
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,500
- Wait, Anton. Anton!
- Have no fear.

879
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,300
Put me down!

880
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,600
She doesn't want to do it on her own.

881
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,800
Your friend is about to have
a life-changing experience.

882
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,600
- Put me down!
- Pillock.

883
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,800
- No!
- What are you doing?

884
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,300
We've got a customer.

885
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,900
- Oh, here we go!
- (Screams)

886
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,300
Dad. Father.

887
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,100
- Ooh!
- Sal!

888
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,400
Sal! Get off me! Sal!

889
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,100
Dave! Dave!

890
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,700
- Don't shoot the messenger.
- Sal's in there!

891
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,700
Get back! Get back!

892
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,900
(Whinnies)

893
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,600
(Cries out)

894
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,100
Wait. Wait!

895
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,100
VALENTINA:
Tony!

896
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,800
Come here, you!

897
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,100
Get off!

898
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,600
Come back!

899
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,600
Wa-argh!

900
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,500
(Sally screams)

901
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,500
(Screams)

902
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,100
(Fly buzzing)

903
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,100
Hi there.

904
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,100
Ow! (Groans)

905
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,000
Shit.

906
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,100
- (Muttering)
- What were you thinking?

907
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,100
Look what you've done.

908
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,800
- (Clattering)
- Jesus.

909
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,600
- Leave us alone.
- I'm trying to help.

910
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,400
Get out of here.

911
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,500
- Leave!
- First to five.

912
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,500
First to five.

913
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,100
- First to five. One down. First to five.
- Ssh. It's OK.

914
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,400
Get up. We've gotta keep moving.

915
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,700
- I know. It's all right. It's fixable.
- Look, all the homeless guys.

916
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,100
- They'll eat our food.
- All right. Let's do this.

917
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,800
- Jesus Christ!
- What are you doing?

918
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,600
- I'm helping.
- You made a mess.

919
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,700
- What? I'm...
- Get out of here. Come on.

920
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,300
- Percy, Percy...
- You're not helping. Get up.

921
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,200
- All right, all right. All right! I'm gone.
- Go away.

922
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,500
(Metal creaks)

923
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,500
(Whistles)

924
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,300
Why don't you just claim it all on insurance?

925
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,100
- Bugger off!
- All right. I was just asking.

926
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,900
(Groans) Oh, God.

927
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,800
That was quite an interesting crowd, wasn't it?

928
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,700
Just leave me alone, mate.

929
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,700
Hey, Val is a little worried about you, mate.

930
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,700
And she wanted me to have a little chat
with you about what happened today,

931
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,900
with the young lady behind the mirror.

932
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,000
Erm... What are you suggesting, mate?

933
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,500
Anton, you can tell me, mate.
We all heard her screaming.

934
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,100
I was screaming as well.

935
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,300
- It was terrifying.
- It was terrifying?

936
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,000
- I don't understand.
- Well, you wouldn't, would you?

937
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,500
You haven't been inside the Doctor's mind,
have you?

938
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,500
- No, I haven't.
- No. Yeah, you, you, my friend,

939
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,500
you probably think it's a scam.

940
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,000
Well, ain't it?

941
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,000
Oh, no.

942
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,200
No, it's not.

943
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,900
I wouldn't, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

944
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,200
Not in a million years.

945
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,100
Right, so if Dr Parnassus
can really control people's minds,

946
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,200
then why isn't he ruling the world, then?

947
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,600
Hey?

948
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,200
Why bother with this little... sideshow act?

949
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,000
It's not a sideshow.
He don't wanna rule the world.

950
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,200
He wants the world to rule itself.

951
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,300
Yeah.

952
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,300
And what about the mirror? What's that about?

953
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,300
- A bit of hocus-pocus?
- No, mate.

954
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,800
Tony, Tony, Tony, you don't get it, man.

955
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,600
It is... (lnhales)

956
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,500
It's impossible to describe. It's just a mystery.

957
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,900
Yeah.

958
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It's everything. It's you, it's me, it's us.
He holds the universe behind that mirror.

959
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,500
Does "first to five" mean anything to you?

960
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,900
I thought you were supposed to be
the clever one.

961
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It's all over. It's lost.

962
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,600
- Finished. Over.
- Ssh. Don't say that.

963
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,300
It's never over.

964
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,300
You're supposed to be immortal,
remember?

965
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,900
Honestly, it's gonna be OK, Dad.

966
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,900
How can you understand?

967
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,400
Hm?

968
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,400
You're a child.

969
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,300
You've never loved.

970
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,300
Not like I have.

971
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,100
From the moment I looked up...

972
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,000
...<i>and saw her, I was captivated</i>.

973
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,500
<i>A prisoner for life</i>.

974
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,600
(Melancholy tune)

975
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,100
(Music stops)

976
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,200
<i>I was a thousand years old</i>.

977
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,300
<i>How could I woo her?</i>

978
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,000
<i>How could I ever make her mine?</i>

979
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,200
Percy, you devil!
Let go. You don't understand.

980
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,200
- Don't be a fool.
- Let go.

981
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,800
- You can't die. You're immortal.
- Let go!

982
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,900
You'll just end up broken in an eternity ward.

983
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,200
And I'll end up looking after you...

984
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,500
- Just let go, you little shit.
...forever!

985
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,900
No!

986
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,900
<i>And at times like these,</i>
<i>the Devil was never far away</i>.

987
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,700
Why look so glum, Parny?

988
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,000
Accentuate the positive.

989
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,300
<i>He granted me mortality again</i>...

990
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,600
<i>and youth and new powers</i>.

991
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,600
<i>Greater powers</i>.

992
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,300
<i>And I won her</i>.

993
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,300
<i>I was so in love</i>.

994
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,900
<i>So in love</i>.

995
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,800
(Thud)

996
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,300
<i>But at what price?</i>

997
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,300
<i>What price?</i>

998
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,800
(Mr Nick laughs)

999
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,800
What's up, Doc?

1000
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,400
But at what price?

1001
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,300
But at what price?

1002
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,300
PARNASSUS:
Pick up those rotten apples.

1003
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,100
Percy, pick up those rotten apples.

1004
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,100
- Ow.
- Sorry.

1005
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,100
Thank God it's only cuts and bruises.

1006
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,100
- Yeah.
- I thought we'd lost you.

1007
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,700
Oh, sweetheart.

1008
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,700
What a sweet thing to say.

1009
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,600
Oh, look at you.

1010
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,700
I've been meaning to ask you
about your father.

1011
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,100
He seems to be in a terrible state, you know.

1012
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,600
Now, is it a financial thing? Is it money?

1013
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,800
I don't know.

1014
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,700
Because if it is,
you know I can help out in that area.

1015
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,600
- I don't know.
- Or is it the show, perhaps?

1016
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,900
I don't care about the show any more.

1017
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,800
Or what about the police? Maybe...

1018
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,500
Bring on the police. I'm sick of living like this.

1019
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,600
Oh, really?

1020
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,700
(Chuckles) Oh, aren't you a little toughie, eh?

1021
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,000
Now, listen, you shouldn't be talking this way.

1022
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,800
All right? It's very important
what you're doing. It's family stuff. You know?

1023
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,500
Maybe it's just things ought to be done
a little different around here.

1024
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,800
What different sort of way do you suggest?

1025
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,900
Morning. How was your sleep last night?

1026
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,900
You had a nasty bump on your head.

1027
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,100
Different? What do you mean?

1028
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,700
Well, I've been thinking, sir, that, you know,
it's quite obvious that people...

1029
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,200
you know,
not many people are attracted to the show.

1030
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,900
Oh, thank you so much.

1031
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,500
Well, forgive me, but I have
a couple of solutions to your problem.

1032
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,700
One: I was thinking of changing
the style of the show.

1033
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,200
And two: I would change the audience, perhaps.

1034
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,000
- Change?
- Yeah.

1035
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,300
But in my opinion I'd change both.
You know, that's just me.

1036
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,100
- And I'd...
- Change the show?

1037
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,600
Who the friggin' hell do you think you are?

1038
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,200
Don't be so afraid of change, mate.

1039
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:58,700
The fact of the matter is,
this show, the stage, it's just not...

1040
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,700
I don't know what the word is.
It's... But you know, it's not...

1041
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,800
Modern?

1042
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,500
Modern. Yes.

1043
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,300
You see, people want modern.
They want, you know, like... like this.

1044
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,300
See. This here is contemporary.
This is what people want.

1045
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,900
I know this world. Trust me. All right?

1046
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,700
Now, with you and your
mind control thingamajigamy,

1047
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,600
we need to meet the public halfway.

1048
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,500
You know?
The right public in the right part of town.

1049
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,300
- What about the filth?
- What?

1050
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,300
- The filth.
- He means the police.

1051
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,100
Oh, well, there'll be a better class of filth too.

1052
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,000
- That will be the day.
- Yeah. Listen.

1053
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,600
The secret is, you know, not to hide.

1054
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,500
Be bold. Be colourful.

1055
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,900
You know, or actually, you know,
be less colourful, perhaps.

1056
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,500
And go places people would
never expect you to be at.

1057
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,800
You know? Think.

1058
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,500
Sir, you saved my life.

1059
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,800
Now let me do something in return for you.

1060
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,900
Please.

1061
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,900
Would you hold on to that?

1062
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,900
Scrumpy.

1063
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:08,000
- You believe in coincidence?
- No, there's no such thing.

1064
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,000
Isn't that what you always told me?

1065
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,800
- Everything has a reason.
- Yes, that's what I believe.

1066
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,900
And the cards. Do you believe in them?

1067
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,900
What the hell are you on about, Dad?
Is this some kind of test?

1068
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,400
Scrumpy, please,
this is an extremely important day.

1069
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,900
Do we gamble on Tony?

1070
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,900
I want your opinion. I need your advice.

1071
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,900
I don't believe this. You want my opinion?

1072
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,500
- Yeah.
- This is the best birthday present ever.

1073
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,900
Yes. Gamble. Let's do it.

1074
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,900
Yes! (Chuckles)

1075
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,900
Let's do it!

1076
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,500
I love you, Dad.

1077
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,600
And the Devil take the hindmost.

1078
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,900
- Well, lovely.
- Yeah.

1079
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,500
How sweet.

1080
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,700
So what do we do now?

1081
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,300
Well, let's see.

1082
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,900
First off, how much money
do we have to play with?

1083
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,100
Cos we're gonna need... all of it.

1084
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,700
Anton!

1085
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,000
What are you doing?
Didn't you do enough damage last night?

1086
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,300
Anton! I'm the one who wants to run away.

1087
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,600
Please, don't spoil my birthday. We need you.

1088
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,500
I need you.

1089
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,000
How much money have you got?

1090
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,200
♪ Ode To Joy

1091
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,100
Look, my dear, did you not read our sign?

1092
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,700
We're here to give, not take, my darling.

1093
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:03,700
But I can see from your beautiful eyes
that you are a very, very generous lady

1094
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,400
and I applaud you for that.

1095
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,100
Excuse me, but how does this work?

1096
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,000
- What does it cost?
- Cost? No.

1097
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,700
The Imaginarium does not cost a thing.
We're not here for money.

1098
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,300
- How long does it take?
- Well, that depends, my dear.

1099
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,300
- I'm running late.
- Late, late, for a very important date.

1100
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,400
Gosh, I can't tell you how many times
I've heard that in my life.

1101
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,200
(Sighs)

1102
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,900
Listen, can I ask you a question?

1103
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,000
Do you dream?

1104
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:31,600
Or should I say,
can you put a price on your dreams?

1105
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:36,700
Or the dreams of the less fortunate
in this world, huh?

1106
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,800
Is there a price for them?

1107
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:46,200
Or are you all in despair at your inability
to change what is wrong in this world, huh?

1108
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,900
You see, I had a dream.

1109
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,600
But I too walked away from it.

1110
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,600
You know, I ignored it.

1111
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,500
I had no time for it.

1112
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,200
Does that sound familiar to you?

1113
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,200
Yes?

1114
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,500
I know, my dear.

1115
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,100
But, you see, ladies and gentlemen,
I was saved by a miracle.

1116
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,700
By Doctor Parnassus.

1117
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,700
He gave me my life back again.

1118
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,300
He gave me a reason to dream.

1119
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,600
He took me to the waterfall of happiness.

1120
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,500
And I was reborn.

1121
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,800
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
I can tell you now, I have been...

1122
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,300
No, I am... purified.

1123
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,600
- I'll go first.
- No, I'm going first!

1124
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,200
No, no, no.

1125
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,700
Ladies, we are actually
solidly booked right now.

1126
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,900
Back off!

1127
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,300
- But we are taking reservations.
- Make a booking. Excuse me.

1128
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,300
- (Women all talk at once)
- Calm down.

1129
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,900
Is that child up for adoption?

1130
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,800
Yes.

1131
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,900
I want to adopt that unfortunate black child.
It shouldn't be working like this.

1132
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,900
It should be in school.

1133
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,500
- Who's in charge here?
- You are, my lady.

1134
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,300
Don't you touch me.

1135
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,700
Don't be frightened, dear.
Everything's OK, officers.

1136
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,700
My darling, tonight is your night.

1137
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,600
- Do you want to be purified?
- Well, oh...

1138
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,700
This is your time.
Please, out of the way.

1139
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,800
But we queued.
How come she gets to be purified?

1140
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,700
She has been chosen, my dear.

1141
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,600
Come away. Trance, Doctor.

1142
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,100
But I haven't paid a thing.

1143
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,900
You can make a donation
on your way out if you feel the need to.

1144
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,500
Some people do. Most people do.

1145
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,100
And he is in his trance.

1146
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,600
Believe me, my dear,
you are the luckiest lady alive.

1147
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,700
- Now, good luck.
- Ooh.

1148
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,500
(Chimes)

1149
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,400
Oh, this is exciting. This is fun.

1150
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,800
There are so many temptations.

1151
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,800
Maybe just a peek?

1152
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,400
VALENTINA:
No, wait, Tony!

1153
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,900
Oh, how gorgeous.

1154
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Golly.

1155
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,900
I say, gorgeous.

1156
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,300
(Gasps)

1157
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,500
It's me.

1158
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,400
(Whimpers)

1159
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,300
Thank you.

1160
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,800
Who are you, dear?

1161
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,500
(Gasps)

1162
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:33,000
Oh, I have always known
that you would look like this.

1163
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,800
I don't even know your name.

1164
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,100
It's Roger.

1165
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,700
No, it's not.

1166
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,100
It's Barry.

1167
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,000
- Barry?
- Yes.

1168
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,400
How dashing.

1169
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,100
Quite.

1170
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,600
Oh, goodness me.

1171
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,100
(Chuckles)

1172
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,300
Just a minute now.

1173
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,300
No, no, just a minute now.

1174
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,400
If I'm not mistaken,
I believe you're meant to go alone.

1175
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,200
Why would I want to go there without you,
my darling?

1176
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,500
Well, it's one of the rules.

1177
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:46,900
One imagination at a time,
free from the influence of another.

1178
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,200
Boring.

1179
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,600
- Don't shoot the messenger, babe.
- I'm not going to shoot the messenger.

1180
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,400
Oh, look, come!

1181
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,600
Another possibility.

1182
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,900
Come. Come, come.

1183
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,500
You must make a choice.

1184
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,800
- Mm.
- Actually, to be quite honest,

1185
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,800
I would strongly recommend this one.

1186
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,000
The gondola.

1187
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,000
(Woman gasps)

1188
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,500
Look,

1189
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,400
Rudolph Valentino.

1190
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,300
James Dean.

1191
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,300
Princess Di.

1192
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,800
All these people...

1193
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,900
...they're all dead.

1194
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,800
Yes.

1195
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,200
But... immortal, nevertheless.

1196
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,100
They won't get old, or fat.

1197
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,600
They won't get sick or feeble.

1198
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,900
They are beyond fear

1199
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,500
because they are forever young.

1200
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,100
They are gods.

1201
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,000
And you can join them.

1202
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,200
You are such a wonderful speaker.

1203
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,500
I know.

1204
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,900
(Gruffly) Get in the boat.

1205
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,300
Ah, one more thing.

1206
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,200
Look at me.

1207
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,700
This is very, very, very, very important.

1208
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,700
Your sacrifice must be absolutely pure.

1209
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:19,500
Therefore you will need to relinquish
all your worldly possessions.

1210
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,700
Oh. You mean this?

1211
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,100
Yes. And this.

1212
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,200
Now this one.

1213
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,400
(Deep gurgling)

1214
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,100
(Rattling)

1215
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,600
Got it! You're free.

1216
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,500
- You're free.
- Thank you.

1217
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,200
- Bye-bye.
- Ta-ta.

1218
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:57,900
Bye.

1219
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,000
Bye.

1220
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,500
Prepare to be reborn, darling.

1221
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,000
And remember...

1222
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,900
Nothing's permanent.

1223
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,400
Not even death.

1224
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,300
Shit.

1225
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,000
I um...

1226
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,600
Have you... What if...

1227
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,200
No, it's...

1228
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,100
Oh.

1229
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,700
What the hell just happened to me?
How did you do that?

1230
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,100

1413
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:50,200
Who were they? Who were those big
Russian men with the fists in my face?

1414
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,800
- That's not important.
- It is.

1415
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,600
- Getting back to that... full body...
- You stole their money.

1416
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:57,300
- No, I didn't.
- You stole their money.

1417
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,500
That's what I heard them say,
with my own ears.

1418
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,700
- You're going to believe them, not me?
- I might.

1419
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,300
And what are these?
Explain these marks on your forehead.

1420
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,700
I don't know. Something satanic... Devil...

1421
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,200
Listen, those were irredeemably bad men.

1422
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,100
Hm?

1423
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,100
OK? And I'm essentially good.

1424
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,600
Oh, sorry, Tony's trying to be, what,

1425
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,500
- prim?
- Self-righteous.

1426
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,300
- Self-righteous?
- Yes.

1427
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,200
- Well, you want me to be honest?
- Oh, yeah.

1428
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,800
- You want the truth?
- I'd love it.

1429
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,500
- Really?
- Think you can muster it up?

1430
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,400
Do you think you can
get it out of that carcass of yours?

1431
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,800
Just for once. Just for me.

1432
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,500
Eh?

1433
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,900
When I set up my charity, Anton -

1434
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,800
a charity for kids -

1435
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,900
I needed money,
and I accepted a loan from those men.

1436
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,500
I had no id...

1437
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,900
I didn't know.

1438
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,600
They laundered dirty money
through the charity.

1439
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,900
I know I was stupid.

1440
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,500
I made a mistake...

1441
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,000
...and the kids weren't to blame.

1442
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,300
They were the innocents.

1443
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,200
But I...

1444
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,700
I carry that every day.

1445
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,700
Every day of my life.

1446
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,000
(Sniffs)

1447
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,300
All right.

1448
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,700
- You wanted the truth.
- Sorry.

1449
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,200
Are you OK?

1450
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:37,000
Thank you for that.

1451
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,500
Where are the ladders?

1452
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,400
Will you show me?

1453
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,100
The clouds...

1454
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,600
Nah.

1455
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,000
Anton...

1456
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,900
Hey, mate, don't leave...

1457
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,900
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Don't leave me here.

1458
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,300
Anton!

1459
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,500
Don't leave me. Come on.

1460
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,500
I almost died today.

1461
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,100
Don't leave me. Mate, come on.

1462
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,200
I ju...

1463
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,500
Oh, this...

1464
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,500
I needed the money!

1465
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,500
When you run a charity,
you have to give lots of money away.

1466
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,100
The red tape, the bureauc...

1467
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,900
You have no idea what a bunch of fascists
the Charity Commission is.

1468
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,900
VALENTINA: How many more times
does he have to say sorry?

1469
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,600
- (Tony knocking)
- This is ridiculous. Bring him down.

1470
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:25,200
Listen, Valentina. Look at me.

1471
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:29,600
Why can't you see that he has betrayed us
and he has fooled us all? It's so obvious.

1472
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,100
TONY: Open the hatch!
- You're just jealous.

1473
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,500
- (Laughs)
- It's not funny.

1474
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,500
I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous.

1475
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,900
Percy, open the hatch.

1476
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,600
Why would he wanna come down?
He knows we don't like him.

1477
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:44,200
Come on, you guys. Look at this stuff.

1478
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,400
Have you forgotten how it was before he came?

1479
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,400
No, no, I haven't forgotten, Valentina.

1480
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,100
It was so pure.
Will you please just unzip me here?

1481
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,800
Pure?

1482
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,100
And the women?
You saw their faces when they came out.

1483
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,800
I saw his faces, Valentina.

1484
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:01,300
I saw both of his faces.
He has at least two. If not more.

1485
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,700
It's my birthday.
Percy, we're supposed to be celebrating.

1486
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,800
(Sighs heavily)

1487
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,400
At least Tony remembered.

1488
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,100
Would you please listen to me
for one second?

1489
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,100
(Three knocks)

1490
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,700
No.

1491
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,500
Leave it.

1492
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,200
(Four knocks)

1493
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,300
Let him in, it's... Tony?

1494
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,200
No, I think not.

1495
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,000
Sit down.

1496
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,700
(Four knocks)

1497
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,900
Can somebody please answer the door?

1498
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,400
I can't stand not answering the door,
or the telephone.

1499
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,900
Drives me crazy. It's not in my nature.

1500
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,600
I won't be able to sleep.

1501
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:53,100
The knock-knock-knocking
is gonna be in my head all night.

1502
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,500
Just things like that.

1503
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,700
(Guttural muttering)

1504
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,400
Well...

1505
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,100
...you've won.

1506
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,400
It's over.

1507
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,800
- Four rotten Russkies?
- And the girl from the pub.

1508
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:19,000
Ahh, Sal.

1509
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,200
She don't count. Do you, Sal?

1510
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,700
And that's how you take your pleasure,
is it?

1511
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,500
Toying with me?

1512
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,100
Like a cat with a mouse?

1513
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,200
Come on.
Sal didn't get to make a real choice.

1514
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:35,100
You were out for the count.
It wouldn't be fair.

1515
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,600
You got four...
So, you know, you get your friend Tony.

1516
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,800
Come on.

1517
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:42,900
We're even.

1518
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,500
It's not quite over.

1519
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,200
(Fly buzzing)

1520
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,500
Not quite.

1521
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,100
Ho-ho, look at the time.

1522
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,000
It's almost eleven.

1523
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,900
(Chuckles)

1524
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,000
Dad?

1525
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,500
What?

1526
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,900
Oh. We're going to have to give
another performance.

1527
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,700
Now, quickly.

1528
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,100
Er...

1529
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,900
Get ready to move out.

1530
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,100
- Who was that?
- Just somebody asking the way.

1531
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,300
I overheard you. He wasn't asking the way.

1532
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,400
Yes. Tony! Percy!

1533
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,300
- What's going on?
- Not now, Scrumpy, not now.

1534
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,100
- Where's Tony?
- What are you hiding?

1535
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,700
It's to do with that rambling story
you started telling and never finished.

1536
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,100
What are you hiding?

1537
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,400
Oh, you...

1538
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,600
I want to know the truth.

1539
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,100
The truth?

1540
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,100
I am thousands of years old.

1541
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,100
I have been immortal.

1542
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,500
And...

1543
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,200
...I did make a bargain with the Devil.

1544
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,200
For that woman, in the story?

1545
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,700
Yes.

1546
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,800
Your mother.

1547
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:16,900
I regained my youth and I won her.

1548
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,700
We lived in joy.

1549
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,500
We grew old together.

1550
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,500
And then one day
she came and told me that she was pregnant.

1551
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,600
Imagine.

1552
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:29,200
60 years old and pregnant.

1553
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,100
It was a miracle.

1554
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,200
But she died giving birth.

1555
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,400
Me?

1556
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,000
Yes.

1557
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,700
Miracle or a mistake?

1558
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,900
You're the best mistake I ever made.

1559
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,500
And the bargain with the Devil?

1560
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,100
There are two parts to a bargain.

1561
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,900
He granted me mortality

1562
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:02,200
on condition that any child I would father...
would, at the age of 16, belong to him.

1563
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,100
No.

1564
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,100
You're just telling a story.

1565
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,100
A cruel story.

1566
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,500
- Why should I believe it?
- Because it's true.

1567
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,400
Every word of it's true.
But... But there's a new wager.

1568
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,400
All is not lost. Now, we can win, we can win.

1569
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,300
- You'll be mine again.
- Enough, enough!

1570
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,900
- Stop!
- No, listen to me, Scrumpy.

1571
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,700
Listen to yourself!

1572
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,300
Who are you? I don't know any more!

1573
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,300
All my life you've filled my head with dreams.

1574
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,100
Your dreams.

1575
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,300
You're making deals with the Devil.

1576
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,100
What am I?

1577
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,700
A pathetic bet?

1578
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,700
Another mistake?

1579
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,600
- Val!
- Oh, she's gone.

1580
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:50,300
- She's gone.
- Telling the truth...

1581
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,900
Always a bad idea.

1582
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,100
Oh, hold your tongue, you smug little pustule!

1583
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,400
Get out of my sight and stay out!

1584
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,600
Perhaps you'll find a midget -
if you're lucky.

1585
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,700
Valentina!

1586
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,700
Valentina!

1587
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:28,500
Valentina!

1588
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,400
Valentina!

1589
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,400
Fuck.

1590
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,400
Come on.

1591
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:49,300
- What are you doing?
- Trying to save your daughter's life, sir.

1592
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,700
Save?

1593
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,000
How?

1594
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,400
Well, I figured I could be the fifth soul.

1595
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,900
See. I could take that risk, sir.

1596
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,500
You're a good lad, Tony, but it's no use.

1597
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,000
We still have time, don't we?

1598
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,000
Yes, of course there's still time, but...

1599
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,200
You know I'd never ask for anything in return?
It's not in my nature.

1600
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:10,700
Well, you're a saint, my boy, you're a saint,
but it... it's positively useless.

1601
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,500
Actually, there is one thing.

1602
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,700
Um...

1603
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:18,100
How about an initiation
into the secrets of the trance?

1604
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,200
- Oh, I can't do that, no.
- What? Why not?

1605
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:22,000
- No, it won't work.
- I could do it.

1606
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,000
- You'd be a great teacher.
- It hurts my head.

1607
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:25,900
- What do you mean?
- Too up... Too upset.

1608
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,100
Oh, it's not a time to be upset, sir.
It's time to be happy.

1609
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,800
I mean, think about Valentina.

1610
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:33,400
Now, we need you to be in a trance
for this to work.

1611
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,800
- Mm.
- Can you give me that?

1612
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,900
- Well...
- Come on. Close your eyes, come on.

1613
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,100
Close your eyes. Think of the ocean.

1614
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,900
The ocean going in and out.

1615
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,700
In and... out.

1616
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,700
Yes, in and... out.

1617
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,900
In and out.

1618
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:58,000
And in and out.

1619
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,800
Shit!

1620
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,400
I don't have time for this.
Pull yourself together.

1621
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,000
This is not a time to be playing baby.

1622
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,300
- It's no good.
- What isn't?

1623
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:14,400
It's no good.

1624
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,200
- Now concentrate.
- Won't work.

1625
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,700
Damn it, Tony, just... I need to calm down.

1626
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,300
You need to calm down.

1627
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:26,200
You just need to relax
and try and um... think of... chocolate.

1628
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:29,300
Um, melting away on a hot stove.

1629
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,100
It's just melting, melting...

1630
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,100
(Parnassus hums softly)

1631
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,300
(Tony joins in humming)

1632
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,800
Good, good, good, good, good.

1633
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:42,100
Right, stay with me, sir. Stay with me.

1634
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:43,900
(Smashing)

1635
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,300
- Oi, what's wrong with you?
- Duty!

1636
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,300
Truth!

1637
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,500
- Oi.
- Justice!

1638
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,700
- Now, what is your problem?
- It's lies.

1639
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,800
Just listen. All right now, calm down.

1640
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,700
Bloody hell, father like daughter.

1641
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,500
- Now come here, look at me.
- No.

1642
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,100
- Calm down.
- No, no.

1643
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,900
- What is wrong? Talk to me.
- Lying...

1644
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,800
- Who's lying?
- I used to think it was precious. It's not.

1645
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:06,800
What, the Imaginarium?
What are you talking about?

1646
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:10,000
- I can't even run away.
- You can't even run away from what?

1647
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,700
- You wanna run away from this?
- Yes.

1648
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,000
Listen, if you wanna get away,
I can take you to a beautiful place.

1649
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,300
All right? I can take you somewhere.

1650
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,800
I can get you out of this darkness.
I'll take you to the light, all right?

1651
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,600
I'll take you somewhere beautiful.

1652
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:25,200
Just you and me. Now trust me.
Come with me now.

1653
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,200
We don't have time for this. All right?

1654
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,300
Now, it's gonna be a paradise, all right?

1655
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,700
It's my world. It could be our world.

1656
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,500
Trust me, it'll be perfect.

1657
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,400
Ah, now. No, see, yeah, that's bad.

1658
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,100
- Did some light reading and found this.
- Can I have a look?

1659
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,600
- Valentina might be interested.
- We don't have time.

1660
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,600
- We gotta get inside.
- He's a liar!

1661
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:47,200
- He's nothing but a liar, Val.
- This was in the past.

1662
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:49,400
In the present, I have to get you in there.

1663
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,600
- So come here and trust me...
- Shut up!

1664
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,400
Shut up!

1665
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:56,700
Val! Valentina!

1666
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,100
No!

1667
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,300
- Aarghh!
- Right.

1668
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,500
I didn't want it to get to this point, mate.

1669
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:08,200
You don't believe what you read
in the newspapers.

1670
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,900
Especially The Mirror.

1671
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,900
(Continues humming)

1672
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,000
(Birdsong)

1673
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,100
(They sigh)

1674
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,200
You were right.

1675
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,100
The world is beautiful.

1676
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,500
- Hmm.
- I always dreamed you'd be like this.

1677
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,500
Yeah?

1678
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,300
And er... well, didn't I say you'd be happy here?

1679
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,700
Isn't it just... perfect?

1680
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,100
Perfect.

1681
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,600
Hmm.

1682
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,800
If only we didn't have to make a choice.

1683
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,900
There doesn't have to be a choice.

1684
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,500
Sweetheart, a rule's a rule.

1685
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,100
Those are my father's rules.

1686
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,700
We're free.

1687
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,300
- See?
- Oh.

1688
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:02,800
- Really?
- Really.

1689
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:04,500
- Hmm.
- (She giggles)

1690
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,400
Well, er... I suppose you are right.

1691
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:10,700
Tony, we're free if we want to be.

1692
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,800
Let's just let the river do the choosing.

1693
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:17,300
Now... kiss me.

1694
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,500
Oh, Val, you're a very naughty girl.

1695
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,000

...I think maybe I love you, Tony.

1703
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,100
Val.

1704
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,500
We should lie here more often.

1705
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:07,300
Get married.

1706
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,300
Make babies.

1707
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,200
(Girl sobbing)

1708
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,700
- Well, maybe this is my, er... choice.
- What d'you mean?

1709
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,300
That's a child. It's not a choice.

1710
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,100
- She needs our help.
- Yes.

1711
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,900
It's OK. It's OK.
Come here, we'll help you.

1712
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Look, don't worry. Don't worry, come here.

1713
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:32,000
No, no, it's OK, we're here to help you.

1714
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,700
- Tony, help me. She's strong.
- No!

1715
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,300
- Come, it's OK. Honestly, no.

01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,400
No, we're friends. Come here.

- Huh?

1719
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,800
- Smile for the cameras, sweetheart.
- Lovely!

1720
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,900
I think this is my world.

01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,500
- (Applause)
♪ Ode To Joy

1722
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:55,100
Well, sustainability's great.
I mean, if you can achieve it.

1723
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,800
The problem in most cases
is you simply can't get there.

1724
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:02,100
Don't you risk entrenching the need for charity
by institutionalising it?

1725
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,500
It's an unfortunate truism that charity,
like poor little Olga here,

1726
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,500
is always with us, to coin a phrase.

1727
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,500
Ah, there you are, my darling.

1728
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen, isn't she a wonder?
Hello. Big smiles.

1729
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:16,400
- What's your message to the President?
- I wouldn't presume to have one.

1730
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:20,300
I think, luckily for the Foundation,
we see eye-to-eye on most things.

1731
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,500
- Tony, I had something...
- Oh, one sec, love.

1732
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,500
(Cheering and whistling)

1733
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:28,000
Mr President, thank you for coming.

1734
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,900

01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:51,600
Yes, so many suffering children.

1741
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:55,700
So much opportunity to do some good, really.
It'll be a big year for our Foundation.

1742
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,500
President is getting ready to make a speech,
introduce me.

1743
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,400
- Yeah.
- Lovely.

1744
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,300
Talk to you tomorrow. Yes, absolutely.

1745
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,500
I've only three words to say.

1746
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,200
Well done, Tony.

1747
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:10,600
Ah, the children. The children.

1748
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,500
This is a vital moment
for the future of the Foundation.

1749
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:17,200
- Children of the world depend on us.
- Valentina!

1750
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,100
Valentina!

1751
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:23,800
- Anton?
- Yep.

1752
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,700
- Anton?
- Yes, yes, listen to me right now.

1753
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,700
This is nothing to do with you. This is him.

1754
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,700
- Where are you?
- This is his imagination.

1755
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,000
Right, call security now!

1756
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,900
Down here, under your arm. Yes, yes.

1757
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,300
- What... Anton, what are you doing here?
- Look.

1758
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:40,800
"Disgraced Director of children's
charity, Suffer The Little Children..."

1759
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,900
He's lying. It's not right, he's jeal...

1760
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,200
"...was arrested last week on charges
of stealing organs of Third World children

1761
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:49,500
and selling them to wealthy Westerners."

1762
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,800
- Come back.
- What are you doing?

1763
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,300
- That's Anton.
- He's lying.

1764
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,300
- Stop!
- Whose side are you on?

1765
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,200
You, you've betrayed me, haven't you?

1766
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:03,400
- After all we've been through.
- Don't you touch her!

1767
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:07,600
I'll show 'em! I'll show them all, Tony.
I'll show 'em all.

1768
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:10,200
PRESIDENT: Have had the courage
to fight poverty...

1769
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:13,000
- He's a liar, he's a fraud!
- Come here, you little bastard!

1770
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,800
- Do not believe him.
- I'll kill you.

1771
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:17,600
...passion... and dedication...
- All right, all right...

1772
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,700
- Trying to...
...careers and struggles...

1773
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,100
Shut up! Trying to ruin my world!

1774
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,900
Stop him!

1775
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,100
- My God.
- Somebody stop him.

1776
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,300
- He's a monster!
- Stop him!

1777
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,500
He was being a very naughty little boy.

1778
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,100
(Booing)

1779
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,800
Christ. Mr President.

1780
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:37,300
Fuck.

1781
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,700
Right.

1782
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,600
Stop him!

1783
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,800
Get out of me way! Christ.

1784
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,400
Er, exit sign?

1785
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,900
Er, oh, no.

1786
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,100
No! No!

1787
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,100
No! I can't. No, no, no...

1788
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,200
No, not good. Er...

1789
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,700
I'm coming after you, Tony!
I'm coming after you!

1790
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,300
No, get off me.

1791
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,900
Get off of me.

1792
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,000
Anton! Anton!

1793
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,500
- Are you OK?
- Are you all right?

1794
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,300
Val! Val, watch out!

1795
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,900
Be careful. Are you all right?

1796
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,700
Valentina.

1797
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,500
- Val. Val!
- Anton.

1798
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,300
Anton.

1799
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:26,800
Val, help me.

1800
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,700
Hold on to me. Hold on to me, please.

1801
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,700
Hold on!

1802
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,400
Aaarrghh! Ohh! Ohh!

1803
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:36,700
I'm sorry.

1804
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,300
I was so wrong.

1805
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,700
Yeah, I know, I know.

1806
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,800
But I love you.

1807
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,500
Who are you working for?
You didn't come up with all this by yourself.

1808
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,900
- You bastard!
- Nah, somebody's got to you.

1809
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,900
Somebody's paid you.
Speak a little Russian, do we?

1810
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,200
- Valentina! Scrumpy!
- Huh?

1811
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,900
Miraculous child, there you are.

1812
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,400
You old bastard.

1813
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,100
After everything we've been through.

1814
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,000
How could you? Is this how you repay me?

1815
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,300
I can't believe it. After everything.

1816
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,500
- And this is all your doing.
- Yeah, all my doing?

1817
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,400
- How could you, Doc?
- No, no, no, no, no.

1818
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:24,800
I'm Felicity. I-I mean I'm the falicitator -
the facilitator - dear boy.

1819
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:27,700
I create the opportunity.
It's not my fault if you're not up to it.

1820
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,000
- I'll forgive you.
- (Angry shouting)

1821
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:40,600
Dad!

1822
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,200
Dad!

1823
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,400
(Siren)

1824
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,500
Wake up.

1825
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,000
Dad!

1826
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:50,400
Please.

1827
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,100
- Please.
- Step back, miss. Step back.

1828
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,000
Sir? Can...?

1829
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,700
Please, miss. There's n-nothing you can do.

1830
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,900
- He's, he's d-d-dead...
- No!

1831
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,100
D-D-Dead drunk.

1832
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,400
- Bollocks.
- Haven't we seen this guy before?

1833
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:11,100
- Oh, they all look the same.
- Aye, bloody drunks.

1834
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,300
I hate you!

1835
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,400
You make me sick!

1836
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,100
This is to be my choice?

1837
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:42,400
Hold your horses.
There's absolutely no need for that.

1838
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,300
That's just plain contrariness.

1839
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,700
Oh, you really think you deserve punishment,
don't you?

1840
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:51,700
You have no idea. You're just a kid.

1841
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,600
Huh!

1842
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:55,200
Where have you been? I'm a woman now.

1843
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,500
Selfish bitch.

1844
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:01,600
- Only fit for...
- Only fit for Hell.

1845
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:05,600
If only.

1846
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:09,700
God, stop. Your pop'd never forgive me.

1847
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,100
That'd be a shame.

1848
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:16,800
Let's dance.

1849
01:39:58,800 --> 01:39:59,900
Damn.

1850
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,100
I've won.

1851
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:25,800
(Sighs)

1852
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:33,300
You know it's... not exactly
what I had in mind, you know.

1853
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,400
All this.

1854
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:40,200
I mean, Valentina being the fifth.

1855
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:45,300
I mean, she's supposed to be the prize,
not part of the final score.

1856
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:48,800
Just doesn't seem fair.

1857
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I hope they get that bastard
and tear him limb from limb.

1858
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,700
But they won't.

1859
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,300
He leads a charmed life, that one.

1860
01:40:58,400 --> 01:40:59,800
(Sniffs) Mm.

1861
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,900
I've been trying to get that bastard
for years.

1862
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,100
I thought I had him this time,
but, you know,

1863
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:08,100
some prat always seems
to come along and rescue him.

1864
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,300
Aargh!

1865
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,700
You know those er...

1866
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:17,000
weird markings that he had
on his forehead when you found him?

1867
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,600
What is all that about?

1868
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,800
Do they protect him or... What is it?

1869
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,300
I've never been into
all black magic stuff.

1870
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,300
I just couldn't get the hang of it.

1871
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:36,500
Can I offer you a stick of gum
or a breath mint?

1872
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,800
Oh, Jesus.
I hate to see you like this, Parny.

1873
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:42,300
I mean...

1874
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,300
I tell you what.

1875
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,700
If you can get me the lowdown
on all those satanic markings...

1876
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:51,300
Better, if you can help me wipe
that self-righteous little creep

1877
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:53,100
off the face of the universe...

1878
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:55,700
I'll give you Valentina back.

1879
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,600
What do you say?

1880
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:06,500
(Angry shouting)

1881
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,400
Oh!

1882
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,400
Thank God for that.

1883
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:23,000
Huh?

1884
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,000
Oh...

1885
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:30,200
Huh? Oh, shit.

1886
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:31,900
Give it to me.

1887
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,600
Oh, no.

1888
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:35,500
Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

1889
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,100
Now just give us a second, please, everybody.

1890
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:41,900
Oh!

1891
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,100
Here's your tube and there's mine.

1892
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:48,300
Mine's a cheap counterfeit, you know.
It breaks so easily.

1893
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,900
(Chuckles)

1894
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,900
Oh, here's another.

1895
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:53,400
Stop!

1896
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,200
You're not amused?

1897
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:58,300
You've been talking to the Devil,
haven't you? What did he say?

1898
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,200
No, wait, let me.

1899
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:03,600
If you manage to kill me,
then he'll release Valentina, right?

1900
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,500
It's all lies. He can't release her.

1901
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,800
He can't release her
cos he doesn't have her.

1902
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:11,300
He doesn't have her
because she's the prize.

1903
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,200
He still doesn't have the five wins.

1904
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,200
But if you kill me, he will, won't he?

1905
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:17,400
Then you'll have lost Valentina forever.

1906
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:18,500
Choose.

1907
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,500
- This is ridiculous!
- Choose!

1908
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:21,900
Right.

1909
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,200
That one.

1910
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:30,100
Sure you made the right choice?

1911
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:32,100
Oh, look...

1912
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,600
Let's find out.

1913
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:41,500
Voilà.

1914
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:46,800
(Angry shouting)

1915
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:49,900
(Groans)

1916
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:53,600
Jesus! Spit it out, you old goat.

1917
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:00,700
Gotcha!

1918
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:12,300
Thank you all for coming.
It's been a splendid success.

1919
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,800
Uh...

1920
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:15,600
Round the neck.

1921
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:54,200
(Coughs and splutters)

1922
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,400
Hey!

1923
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,900
There are three cardinal rules, Mr Nick.

1924
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,700
One: There is no black magic,
only cheap tricks.

1925
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,300
And I forget the others.

1926
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,900
Now where's my daughter?

1927
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,900
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

1928
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,800
How should I know?

1929
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:18,700
You're her father.
You're her loving father.

1930
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,000
I mean, she is free, isn't she?

1931
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:29,700
Jesus.

1932
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,900
(Wind howls)

1933
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,800
<i>And the years roll on</i>.

1934
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:50,400
<i>Winds still blow</i>.

1935
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:53,100
<i>Snows still fall</i>.

1936
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,100
<i>Fires</i>...<i>still burn</i>.

1937
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,900
(Groans)

1938
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,900
<i>And yet</i>...

1939
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,900
<i>everything has changed</i>.

1940
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:05,900
<i>Is that my punishment?</i>

1941
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:10,600
<i>Am I never to find her?</i>

1942
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,100
Please stop.

1943
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,000
No more choices.

1944
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,900
No more choices.

1945
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,300
(Groans)

1946
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,300
(Sobs softly)

1947
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,000
(Continues sobbing)

1948
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:17,000
(Small bells tinkling)

1949
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,500
(Anklet tinkling)

1950
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,300
PERCY:
So you found her?

1951
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:49,200
PARNASSUS:
Yes.

1952
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:52,000
Yes, I found her.

1953
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,600
I think...

1954
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,500
...she may have a daughter.

1955
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,400
You're not going in there, are you?

1956
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:04,700
Er...

1957
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:08,200
You wouldn't want to scar a child
for life, would you?

1958
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:11,200
Look at you.

1959
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:13,200
No.

1960
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:16,100
Ohh.

1961
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,800
The Great Doctor Parnassus.

1962
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:21,900
You're an utter disgrace.

1963
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,600
This is gonna take some time.

1964
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:29,500
(Chuckles) Oh, Percy.

1965
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,400
What would I do without you?

1966
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:36,600
BOTH:
Get a midget.

1967
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:40,200
PERCY: Let Doctor Parnassus
open your imagination.

1968
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:43,400
Transcend heights
on Beauty's open wing

1969
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:46,400
and be transported to worlds
you've never dreamed of.

1970
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:51,000
Does it come with a happy ending?

1971
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,100
Sorry, we can't guarantee that.

1972
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,300
Ladies.

1973
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,000
God bless you, son.

1974
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:07,700
(Mr Nick chuckles)

1975
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:14,500
Get back to work.

1976
