00:00:04.463 --> 00:00:07.591
{\an8}<i>spring training camp and
he's definitely got the inside track.</i>

2
00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:10.344
{\an8}<i>Word is that they're having
some problems with injuries.</i>

3
00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.095
{\an8}<i>Really? Are they looking into...</i>

4
00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.598
{\an8}<i>...free-agent signings last second,
anything like that?</i>

5
00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:17.100
{\an8}<i>Possibly, and they've got
a strong farm club too.</i>

6
00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.103
{\an8}<i>They've got some triple-A ballplayers
they might bring up.</i>

7
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.940
{\an8}<i>Peter would certainly be able
to tell us more about that.</i>

8
00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.441
{\an8}<i>Who do you like?</i>

9
00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:26.944
{\an8}<i>So far,
I like what I'm seeing in New York.</i>

10
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.197
{\an8}<i>They've got a strong ball club, as usual.
That's in the American.</i>

11
00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.950
{\an8}<i>And in the National,
I'm still liking Chicago...</i>

12
00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.577
{\an8}<i>...with a little bit of a twist here
for Los Angeles.</i>

13
00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.622
{\an8}<i>Okay, so we're looking at
New York-Chicago World Series...</i>

14
00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.375
{\an8}<i>-...possible Los Angeles.
-Could be a dark horse.</i>

15
00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.460
{\an8}<i>Hold him to it
at the end of the season.</i>

16
00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:45.754
{\an8}<i>That's gonna do it for us
from the Sports Desk.</i>

17
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:48.799
{\an8}<i>-Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave.
-Thanks for nothing, Eddie.</i>

18
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:53.595
{\an8}<i>Thank you, guys. That's not all we're
following. Here's Karen at the Health Desk.</i>

19
00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:57.182
{\an8}The world of medicine
has seen its share of miracle cures...

20
00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.977
{\an8}...from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants...

21
00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:05.274
{\an8}...but all past achievements may pale in
comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.

22
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.276
{\an8}Thank you for joining us this morning.

23
00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:12.281
{\an8}-Not at all.
-So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

24
00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:15.158
{\an8}Well, the premise is quite simple.

25
00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.662
{\an8}Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

26
00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.165
{\an8}...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

27
00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:23.959
{\an8}-We're talking about a virus?
-Yes.

28
00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:25.919
{\an8}In this case, the measles virus...

29
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:31.258
{\an8}...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

30
00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:34.720
{\an8}Um, I'm not-- I find the best way
to describe it is...

31
00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:37.389
{\an8}...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

32
00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:42.436
{\an8}...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

33
00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:45.647
{\an8}...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

34
00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:49.109
{\an8}But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

35
00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:52.613
{\an8}...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

36
00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.073
{\an8}Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

37
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.869
{\an8}Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials
in humans so far.

38
00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:02.789
{\an8}-And how many are cancer-free?
-Ten thousand and nine.

39
00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:06.084
{\an8}So you have actually cured cancer?

40
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.921
{\an8}Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

41
00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.702
What you see? What you see?

42
00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:49.956
Damn.

43
00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.125
Let's go, Sam.

44
00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.545
Come on.

45
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.868
<i>Good morning, Matt.
It's looking great, I'll tell you.</i>

46
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:58.413
<i>Not only was this the biggest
snowstorm in New York City history...</i>

47
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.958
<i>...it had to be one of the prettiest.
Imagine waking up on Sunday...</i>

48
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:05.420
<i>...to 26.9 inches of snow
in New York City.</i>

49
00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.881
Here you go.
Just the way you like it.

50
00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.133
Disgusting.

51
00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.553
Excuse me, excuse me.

52
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.640
All right. Come on, relax.

53
00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:21.102
<i>However, it did strand
planes, trains and automobiles.</i>

54
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:25.523
<i>There was a report, a Turkish Airlines
flight skidded off the runway at JFK.</i>

55
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.485
<i>No one was injured,
but for the most part, Matt...</i>

56
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.653
There you go.

57
00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:36.201
<i>I'm gonna show you, attempting
the Bob Hager rule of thumb here.</i>

58
00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.870
<i>And I'm gonna plug my ruler in.</i>

59
00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:43.958
<i>In New York, in 30 Rock,
we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.</i>

60
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.502
<i>Back to you, Matt and Katie.</i>

61
00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:50.090
<i>Gosh. All right, it looks great. It'll be
beautiful for the next day, at least.</i>

62
00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.133
<i>-And then it turns brown.
-If that.</i>

63
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.843
<i>Anyway, Ann, thanks so much.</i>

64
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.514
Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.

65
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.767
Don't just push them around, eat them.
I'm not playing.

66
00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.394
<i>Good morning. This morning,
all up the East Coast...</i>

67
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:07.440
Okay. You gonna eat your vegetables.
We will sit down here all night.

68
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.527
<i>The biggest challenge
is getting back to work.</i>

69
00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:15.949
What are you whining about?
Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?

70
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.910
Hey. All right, here's the deal.
Look. Look.

71
00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:22.872
You're gonna eat twice as many vegetables
tomorrow night. All right?

72
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:26.042
Deal? Deal?

73
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.382
Come on.

74
00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:40.390
<i>Don't worry
About a thing</i>

75
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.604
<i>'Cause every little thing
Gonna be all right</i>

76
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.983
I know that feels good.

77
00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:55.697
<i>Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds</i>

78
00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:58.074
Ah, Sam.

79
00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:04.080
<i>Singin' sweet songs
Of melody--</i>

80
00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.111
I'm all right.

81
00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.238
I'm all right, it's all right.

82
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:08.371
What's happening? I tried to reach you
on your cell. I get a recording.

83
00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.290
-Cell service is down.
-Where are we going?

84
00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.042
-Can't get used to the new regs.
-Going to Aunt Sara's.

85
00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:16.921
-Ma! No! Why?
-Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.

86
00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:20.091
-We're at 30 minutes, colonel.
-Copy.

87
00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:24.012
-Thirty minutes to what?
-They're sealing off the island.

88
00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:33.104
-Seal off the island? This island?
-But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's.

89
00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.191
-Did you bring all the money?
-Yeah.

90
00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:36.713
-How much?
-Six hundred.

91
00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:38.067
Why did you say, "You're going"?

92
00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.634
-That's not enough.
-Robert.

93
00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.696
You said, "You're going," not, "We're going."

94
00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:45.742
When you get across, I need you to get
to the ATM. Get as much cash as you can.

95
00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:48.703
Take Sara's car, go upstate.
I'll meet you at the farm.

96
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.955
Bring enough food for two weeks.

97
00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:53.666
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?

98
00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:55.543
Is it airborne?

99
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.671
But we only go to Aunt Sara's
in the summer.

100
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.631
-It may be.
-Oh, my God.

101
00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:04.552
-It's Christmas. What about my presents?
-He's announcing it.

102
00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:07.239
<i>Make no mistake, Americans, this virus--</i>

103
00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.182
You left my Christmas presents
in the closet.

104
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.350
Hush now, Mar.

105
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:14.270
<i>--threatens the survival of not only our
nation, but of every other nation--</i>

106
00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:16.731
-Mommy, look, it's a butterfly.
-Marley, enough!

107
00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:21.444
<i>And so it is with great sadness,
but even greater resolve...</i>

108
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:24.447
<i>...that tonight I have signed
an executive order...</i>

109
00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:28.826
<i>...initiating a military quarantine
of New York City.</i>

110
00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.953
<i>God be with us.</i>

111
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.206
<i>This has been a special--</i>

112
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:39.921
The window is still open. We find
something in a week or two weeks...

113
00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:43.591
...we can reverse the spread.

114
00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:49.972
I can still fix this.

115
00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:54.936
Please. You can do the same work
outside the city.

116
00:14:55.645 --> 00:15:00.900
This is ground zero. This is my site.
We talked about this.

117
00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:02.735
What are you doing?

118
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:07.115
What am I doing?

119
00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.493
I'm not gonna let this happen.

120
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.500
Let? This isn't up to you.
You can't control--

121
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.540
Ah! Daddy, it's a monster!

122
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:32.098
How'd you sleep?

123
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:09.385
Look out. Come on,
you know better than that.

124
00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.053
Uh-uh.

125
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.805
I'll be back.

126
00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:50.760
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012,
GA series, serum 391.

127
00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.930
Animal trials. Streaming video.

128
00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:18.496
GA series results appear typical.

129
00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:28.965
Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...

130
00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:35.471
...11, 14, 16, 18 did not kill the virus.

131
00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:39.559
Compounds 2, 5, 7...

132
00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:43.980
...12,13,15,17...

133
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.566
...all killed the host.

134
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.407
Hold on a second.

135
00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:03.082
Compound 6 appears to be showing
decreased aggression response.

136
00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:07.420
Partial pigmentation return.

137
00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:10.506
Slight pupil constriction.

138
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:15.011
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6...

139
00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:17.221
...next candidate for human trials.

140
00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.932
You hang in there, number six.

141
00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.061
Yeah, that's what you want.

142
00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:29.794
Hey!

143
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.880
Good morning, Marge.
Good morning, Fred.

144
00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:35.591
What are you guys doing here so early?

145
00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:40.388
That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred.
Don't set it down anywhere.

146
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:47.561
I'll see you guys inside.

147
00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.115
What's happening, buddy?

148
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:16.841
Yes.

149
00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:43.075
Good morning, Hank.
I'm midway through the G's.

150
00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:48.122
Hey, Who's the girl in...?

151
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:54.670
Never mind.
Hey, I'll see you in the morning.

152
00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:01.218
<i>What am I supposed to say?</i>

153
00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:03.554
"Hello.

154
00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:06.307
Wanna see some infected rats?"

155
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:16.317
Okay, tomorrow.
I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.

156
00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:27.203
Psst.

157
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.385
Come here. Hey. Hey.

158
00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:45.638
Good job. You did so good.

159
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.599
Yes. Yes.

160
00:22:42.528 --> 00:22:43.946
Ah.

161
00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:50.286
Look at that. See that? Red salmon.

162
00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:53.706
Wow, actual Spam. Yeah.

163
00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:55.875
You'll get some of that later.

164
00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:20.608
Let's go.

165
00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:27.948
Wait.

166
00:24:06.862 --> 00:24:09.740
<i>My name is Robert Neville.</i>

167
00:24:09.907 --> 00:24:12.576
<i>I am a survivor living in New York City.</i>

168
00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:18.332
<i>I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.</i>

169
00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:21.919
<i>I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...</i>

170
00:24:22.086 --> 00:24:25.172
<i>...when the sun is highest in the sky.</i>

171
00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:29.134
<i>If you are out there...</i>

172
00:24:29.593 --> 00:24:32.972
<i>If anyone is out there...</i>

173
00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:35.391
<i>I can provide food.</i>

174
00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:38.310
<i>I can provide shelter.</i>

175
00:24:38.852 --> 00:24:41.271
<i>I can provide security.</i>

176
00:24:43.399 --> 00:24:45.901
<i>If there's anybody out there...</i>

177
00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:47.820
<i>...anybody...</i>

178
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.155
<i>Please.</i>

179
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.075
<i>You are not alone.</i>

180
00:24:55.577 --> 00:24:58.414
Fore!

181
00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:19.977
Yeah.

182
00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.484
Keep your eye on this one for me.

183
00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:32.031
Ooh.

184
00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:39.621
I'm getting good.

185
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.656
Ss-ss.

186
00:26:27.086 --> 00:26:29.046
Sam! No, no, no!

187
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:30.589
No! No! Sam!

188
00:26:30.964 --> 00:26:32.508
No! No!

189
00:26:34.343 --> 00:26:37.012
Sam? Sam? Sam?

190
00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:39.765
Sam? Sam?

191
00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.145
Sam? Sam?

192
00:26:45.395 --> 00:26:47.439
Hello, Sam?

193
00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:51.151
Sam?

194
00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:56.115
Sam?

195
00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.909
Come on. Sam.

196
00:27:37.197 --> 00:27:39.408
I gotta go, Sam.

197
00:27:39.575 --> 00:27:42.703
I gotta go. I gotta go.

198
00:29:26.556 --> 00:29:28.267
Sam?

199
00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:41.798
Sam? Sam?

200
00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:44.509
Sam? Sam?

201
00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:47.596
Sam. Sam.

202
00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:51.391
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go.
Sam.

203
00:30:52.142 --> 00:30:53.935
What are you doing?

204
00:31:05.447 --> 00:31:07.282
Sam, we gotta go!

205
00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:17.042
Sam, go! Go!

206
00:31:17.209 --> 00:31:19.544
Sam, get out! Get out!

207
00:32:17.394 --> 00:32:21.356
You gotta pay attention, okay?
You gotta pay attention.

208
00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:23.191
Listen, uh...

209
00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:27.279
...I want you to stay here
on this one, okay?

210
00:32:29.698 --> 00:32:32.409
Because you can still get infected.

211
00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:35.036
And I can't.

212
00:32:51.887 --> 00:32:55.015
So, look, if I'm not back by dark...

213
00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.103
...just go.

214
00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:36.658
Okay. Subject is female.
Likely 18 to 20 years of age.

215
00:34:36.825 --> 00:34:41.162
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively
at six times human dose.

216
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:45.166
Core temperature, 106 Fahrenheit.
Pulse, 200 bpm.

217
00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:46.501
Respiration elevated.

218
00:34:46.668 --> 00:34:50.505
PA 02, 300 percent of normal.

219
00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:59.347
Pupils fully dilated.

220
00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:01.850
Nonreactive to light.

221
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.697
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.

222
00:35:15.864 --> 00:35:21.536
Symptoms and tissue samples
confirm subject is infected with KV.

223
00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:25.540
Vaccine test.

224
00:35:25.707 --> 00:35:30.003
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6.

225
00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:32.297
Commencing human trials.

226
00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.239
Respiration slowing.

227
00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:03.411
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...

228
00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:06.122
...105...

229
00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:08.792
...104 and decreasing.

230
00:36:11.211 --> 00:36:12.879
We may have something here.

231
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:04.472
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6
ineffective on humans.

232
00:37:23.158 --> 00:37:27.829
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.

233
00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:29.998
Still no cure.

234
00:37:46.848 --> 00:37:49.392
<i>Day 1001.</i>

235
00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:52.687
<i>We came in close contact
with a hive today.</i>

236
00:37:52.854 --> 00:37:56.608
<i>Blood tests confirm that
I remain immune to both the airborne...</i>

237
00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:59.527
...and contact strains.

238
00:37:59.694 --> 00:38:04.574
Canines remain immune
to airborne strain only.

239
00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:09.913
You can't go running
into the dark, dummy.

240
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.708
Vaccine trials continue.

241
00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:17.962
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity
to infected hosts.

242
00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:21.382
The Krippin Virus is...

243
00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:23.551
...elegant.

244
00:38:28.598 --> 00:38:31.726
Just fishing in the dark, son.

245
00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:38.608
Mm. A behavioral note, um:

246
00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:44.113
An infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.

247
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.077
Now, it's possible
decreased brain function...

248
00:38:49.244 --> 00:38:54.374
...or the growing scarcity of food
is causing them to...

249
00:38:55.542 --> 00:38:59.462
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

250
00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:05.844
Social de-evolution appears complete.

251
00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:11.266
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.

252
00:39:18.147 --> 00:39:19.649
Why are we stopping?

253
00:39:24.112 --> 00:39:26.155
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

254
00:39:26.322 --> 00:39:29.617
-We got less than 10 minutes.
-Baby, give me the dog.

255
00:39:33.246 --> 00:39:35.246
-Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
-Daddy!

256
00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:37.709
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.

257
00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:41.546
Keep the colonel and his family
between us and don't let anyone stop you.

258
00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:43.131
Mommy, they have guns!

259
00:39:43.298 --> 00:39:45.300
It's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy.

260
00:39:45.466 --> 00:39:47.586
<i>Unless you have clearance...</i>

261
00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:51.139
<i>...you cannot pass the checkpoint.
Please return to your homes.</i>

262
00:39:51.306 --> 00:39:54.684
Make a hole, make a hole!
Coming through!

263
00:40:00.315 --> 00:40:02.317
Coming through!

264
00:40:33.848 --> 00:40:37.352
<i>Unless you have clearance,
you cannot pass the checkpoint.</i>

265
00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:39.562
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

266
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.612
You're clear. Move ahead.

267
00:40:48.029 --> 00:40:49.072
You're clear.

268
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.824
All right, that's it, move up.

269
00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:54.369
All right, step up.

270
00:40:54.869 --> 00:40:57.121
You're clear. Next. Let's go.

271
00:40:58.373 --> 00:40:59.791
No good.

272
00:40:59.958 --> 00:41:03.002
<i>Military quarantine
is about to begin.</i>

273
00:41:04.545 --> 00:41:06.089
Come on, step back.

274
00:41:06.255 --> 00:41:09.092
<i>-Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>
-Look, look, look.

275
00:41:09.258 --> 00:41:11.338
-I'm not infected.
-Clear. Good, go on.

276
00:41:11.386 --> 00:41:12.512
I'm not infected.

277
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.097
Please! Please!

278
00:41:14.263 --> 00:41:18.017
-Please take my baby. Take my baby, please.
-You're gonna have to move back.

279
00:41:20.061 --> 00:41:21.562
-No good.
-Follow me, ma'am.

280
00:41:21.729 --> 00:41:25.066
What? No! Robert! Robert!

281
00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:27.402
Get your hands off my wife.
Get your hands off.

282
00:41:27.568 --> 00:41:29.946
-Mommy!
-Stand down.

283
00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:31.155
Lieutenant--

284
00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:33.992
-Mommy!
-Scan her again. Get your hands off of her!

285
00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:35.618
Get your hands off of my wife.

286
00:41:35.785 --> 00:41:38.121
-Stand down!
-Scan her again. Stand down!

287
00:41:38.287 --> 00:41:40.915
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!

288
00:41:41.082 --> 00:41:44.669
I am Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville.
I am ordering you to scan her again.

289
00:41:44.836 --> 00:41:46.546
Scan her again!

290
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:52.135
All right, scan her again.

291
00:41:55.138 --> 00:41:57.932
-It's clear.
-It's clear. Move through.

292
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:01.477
Who's next? Come on.

293
00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:04.564
Take my baby with you!
Please! Please!

294
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:07.942
-Mommy!
-Please take my baby. Please!

295
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:13.114
Daddy, why can't the little girl come too?

296
00:42:13.656 --> 00:42:15.867
<i>Stay away from the shoreline.</i>

297
00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:17.702
How long?

298
00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:20.121
Five minutes. We'll make it.

299
00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:23.458
This is Ranger 621, we're on site.

300
00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:27.211
<i>Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>

301
00:42:39.307 --> 00:42:44.312
I won't take my eyes off them, colonel.
You got my word on it.

302
00:42:49.192 --> 00:42:50.818
Give me a kiss.

303
00:43:01.287 --> 00:43:03.956
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

304
00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:07.502
Dear Lord, please watch over Robert...

305
00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:10.004
...and keep him strong
through the struggles ahead.

306
00:43:10.171 --> 00:43:14.217
Lord, please just bring him home safely.
Amen.

307
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.221
Daddy's gonna make the monsters
go away, baby, okay?

308
00:43:18.387 --> 00:43:20.681
Sam, you protect Daddy.

309
00:43:20.848 --> 00:43:24.852
-No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog.
-Sir, we gotta go!

310
00:43:27.563 --> 00:43:30.942
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

311
00:43:31.567 --> 00:43:33.861
<i>It's a butterfly.</i>

312
00:43:36.364 --> 00:43:38.407
All right, come on, let's go!

313
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.164
How'd you sleep?

314
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.458
<i>Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look
at the ongoing mutations...</i>

315
00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:34.547
<i>...of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed
miracle cure for cancer.</i>

316
00:44:34.714 --> 00:44:38.843
<i>So far, almost 5000 patients
treated with her retrofitted virus...</i>

317
00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:42.847
<i>...have begun exhibiting symptoms
resembling the early onset of rabies.</i>

318
00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:45.808
<i>Twenty-five patients have already died.</i>

319
00:44:45.975 --> 00:44:50.188
<i>Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals
to stockpile antiviral drugs...</i>

320
00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:53.274
<i>...and to begin
preliminary quarantine protocols.</i>

321
00:44:53.441 --> 00:44:55.026
It's my birthday.

322
00:44:55.193 --> 00:44:58.571
<i>We are fully confident Dr. Neville
can see us through these--</i>

323
00:44:58.738 --> 00:45:00.448
You gonna sing?

324
00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:03.784
<i>My name is Robert Neville.</i>

325
00:45:04.327 --> 00:45:07.538
<i>I am a survivor living in New York City.</i>

326
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:13.294
<i>I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.</i>

327
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.548
<i>I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...</i>

328
00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:20.551
<i>...when the sun is highest in the sky.</i>

329
00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:26.807
<i>If you are out there,
if anyone is out there...</i>

330
00:45:26.974 --> 00:45:31.145
<i>I can provide food. I can provide shelter.</i>

331
00:45:31.312 --> 00:45:34.065
<i>I can provide security.</i>

332
00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:37.735
<i>If there's anybody out there, anybody...</i>

333
00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:41.864
<i>Please.</i>

334
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.492
<i>You are not alone.</i>

335
00:45:45.493 --> 00:45:47.078
Listen, uh...

336
00:45:47.245 --> 00:45:50.623
...if you're planning a party or something,
just tell me now.

337
00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:53.668
Okay? Because you know
I don't like surprises.

338
00:45:53.834 --> 00:45:57.463
And I swear I'll act surprised. Okay?

339
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:29.203
Hey! Hey!

340
00:46:42.341 --> 00:46:45.428
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

341
00:46:48.014 --> 00:46:51.142
What the--? What the hell are you--?
No!

342
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.020
No! No!

343
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:57.565
No.

344
00:46:57.732 --> 00:47:00.568
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

345
00:47:00.943 --> 00:47:03.237
How did you get out here?!

346
00:47:03.404 --> 00:47:06.574
Fred, if you're real,
you better tell me right now!

347
00:47:06.741 --> 00:47:10.161
If you're real,
you better tell me right now!

348
00:47:23.132 --> 00:47:25.259
Damn it, Fred!

349
00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:27.803
Damn it!

350
00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:31.719
I'm all right. I'm all right, I'm all right.

351
00:49:57.536 --> 00:50:00.414
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

352
00:50:25.773 --> 00:50:28.400
Baby. I'm okay.

353
00:50:29.318 --> 00:50:32.488
I'm okay. I'm okay.

354
00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:51.859
Let's go.

355
00:51:52.026 --> 00:51:54.987
Eh, eh! Come on. Sam, come on.

356
00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:08.542
Let's go! Sam!

357
00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:20.554
No! No! Let's go!

358
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:23.474
We gotta go home, Sam. Let's go!

359
00:52:52.252 --> 00:52:53.712
Sam!

360
00:53:00.094 --> 00:53:01.970
No!

361
00:53:25.661 --> 00:53:28.080
Sam? Sam?

362
00:53:30.833 --> 00:53:32.209
It's okay.

363
00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:35.462
You're all right. Okay. It's okay.

364
00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:38.132
You're all right. You're all right.

365
00:53:38.507 --> 00:53:41.260
Samantha? Samantha, look at me, girl.

366
00:53:41.427 --> 00:53:45.639
Hey. You're okay.
You're okay. Samantha.

367
00:53:45.806 --> 00:53:48.976
We just gotta get you home.
Gotta get you-- Gotta take you home.

368
00:53:49.143 --> 00:53:51.729
Let me take you home.
All right, come here.

369
00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:54.356
Come here. Come here. Come here.

370
00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:30.851
Come on. Come here. Come here.

371
00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:33.437
I got you. I got you.

372
00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:42.196
It's okay.

373
00:54:43.071 --> 00:54:44.823
You're okay.

374
00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:54.625
<i>Don't worry</i>

375
00:54:56.835 --> 00:54:58.962
<i>About a thing</i>

376
00:55:00.005 --> 00:55:05.177
<i>'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right</i>

377
00:55:08.639 --> 00:55:14.269
<i>Don't worry
About a thing</i>

378
00:55:19.066 --> 00:55:21.527
<i>Rise up this morning</i>

379
00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:25.739
<i>Smiled with the rising sun</i>

380
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:34.081
<i>Three little birds</i>

381
00:58:37.305 --> 00:58:39.766
I promised my friend...

382
00:58:41.393 --> 00:58:46.565
...that I would say hello to you today.

383
00:58:51.236 --> 00:58:52.946
Hello.

384
00:59:00.704 --> 00:59:02.414
Hello.

385
00:59:12.883 --> 00:59:15.677
Please say hello to me.

386
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:25.312
Please say hello to me.

387
01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.394
Die!

388
01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:48.770
Die!

389
01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:04.536
Die!

390
01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:47.847
Come on! Stay with me!

391
01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:51.977
Where do you live?

392
01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:55.689
Hey.

393
01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:57.691
Hey!

394
01:02:57.857 --> 01:02:59.985
Stay with me.

395
01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.154
Where do you live?

396
01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.660
Where do you live?

397
01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:10.662
Uh...

398
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:15.041
11 Washington Square.

399
01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:18.295
They don't know where I live.

400
01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:22.674
Don't-- Don't let them track us.

401
01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:25.635
You gotta stay out till dawn.

402
01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:30.492
No!

403
01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:33.995
<i>Donkey?</i>

404
01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:36.081
<i>What are you doing?</i>

405
01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:39.584
<i>I would think of all people you would
recognize a wall when you see one.</i>

406
01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:44.506
<i>Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.</i>

407
01:04:44.672 --> 01:04:47.634
<i>It is. Around your half, see?
That's your half, this is my half.</i>

408
01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:51.388
<i>-Oh, your half? Hm.
-Yes, my half.</i>

409
01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:55.183
<i>I helped rescue the princess. I did
half the work. I get half the booty.</i>

410
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:58.728
<i>Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.</i>

411
01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:01.022
<i>-Back off!
-No, you back off.</i>

412
01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:03.274
<i>-This is my swamp!
-Our swamp.</i>

413
01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:08.905
<i>-Smelly ogre.
-Fine!</i>

414
01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:11.334
<i>Come back,
I'm not through with you!</i>

415
01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:12.992
<i>Well, I'm through with you.</i>

416
01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:16.287
<i>You know, with you
it's always "me, me, me."</i>

417
01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:21.501
<i>Well, guess what, now it's my turn.
So you just shut up and pay attention!</i>

418
01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:25.839
<i>You are mean to me! You insult me and
you don't appreciate anything that I do.</i>

419
01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:28.425
<i>You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.</i>

420
01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:32.971
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?</i>

421
01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:36.307
<i>Because that's What friends do!
They forgive each other!</i>

422
01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:38.351
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

423
01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:40.854
<i>You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...</i>

424
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.522
<i>...for stabbing me in the back!</i>

425
01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:49.362
<i>You're so wrapped up in layers,
you're afraid of your own feelings.</i>

426
01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:50.697
<i>-Go away.
-See?</i>

427
01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:53.032
<i>Doing it again,
just like you did to Fiona...</i>

428
01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:55.368
<i>...and all she did was like you,
maybe love you.</i>

429
01:05:55.535 --> 01:06:00.039
<i>Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.</i>

430
01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:01.833
<i>I heard the two of you talking.</i>

431
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.838
<i>She wasn't talking about you,
she was talking about somebody else.</i>

432
01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:18.349
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.

433
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.560
Obviously you know that.

434
01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:22.604
They're yours.

435
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:27.775
But I did find bacon, which is about
the most fantastic thing in history.

436
01:06:27.942 --> 01:06:31.738
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

437
01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:34.282
I put by your plate,
because your leg is okay...

438
01:06:34.449 --> 01:06:38.661
...but it won't be for very long
if you don't start a course soon.

439
01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:41.748
Who are you?

440
01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:45.793
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.

441
01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:55.011
Don't let it get cold.

442
01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:10.693
It's okay. Go on.

443
01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:39.973
We came from Maryland.
We heard your message on the radio.

444
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.726
We were at the pier at noon.
We waited all day.

445
01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:48.147
We're going to Vermont.

446
01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:51.484
To the survivors' colony.

447
01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.653
What?

448
01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:58.241
In Bethel. It's a safe zone.

449
01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.868
There's no survivors' colony,
there's no safe zones.

450
01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:03.079
Nothing happened
the way it was supposed to.

451
01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:05.164
Nothing worked
the way it was supposed to.

452
01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:09.919
In the mountains. There's a whole colony
of people there who didn't get sick.

453
01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.630
The virus couldn't survive the cold.
There's a colony--

454
01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:15.008
Shut up! Shut up!

455
01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:16.634
Everybody's dead.

456
01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:18.928
Everybody is dead.

457
01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:29.981
I just need--
I need a minute. Okay?

458
01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:33.109
Just...

459
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:39.907
I just-- I was saving that bacon.

460
01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:42.785
I was saving it.

461
01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:48.082
I'm just-- I'm gonna go upstairs.
All right? Just--

462
01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:50.293
I'm gonna go.

463
01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:11.064
Ethan, put the knife down.

464
01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:49.977
<i>-You there! Ogre.
-Aye.</i>

465
01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:52.313
<i>By the order of Lord Farquaad...</i>

466
01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.899
<i>...I am authorized
to place you both under arrest...</i>

467
01:09:55.066 --> 01:10:00.863
<i>...and transport you
to a designated resettlement facility.</i>

468
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:05.410
<i>Oh, really? You and what army?</i>

469
01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:18.339
Can I say something to you?

470
01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:21.509
You was really, really something
back there. Incredible.

471
01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:23.886
Are you talking to...

472
01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:26.055
...me?

473
01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:30.727
Yes, I was talking to you.
You was really great back there.

474
01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:34.147
Those guards, they thought they was
all that. You showed up, and barn!

475
01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:36.566
Tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

476
01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:38.776
That really made me
feel good to see that.

477
01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:41.154
That's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.

478
01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:45.450
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

479
01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:47.118
Hm?

480
01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:48.703
But, uh...

481
01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:50.496
...I don't have any friends.

482
01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:53.166
And I'm not going out there by myself.

483
01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:55.960
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.
I'll stick with you!

484
01:10:56.127 --> 01:10:57.879
<i>You a mean,
green fighting machine.</i>

485
01:10:58.045 --> 01:11:01.174
<i>Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.</i>

486
01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:05.678
I like <i>Shrek.</i>

487
01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:08.264
<i>That was really scary.
If you don't mind me saying...</i>

488
01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:11.184
<i>...if that don't work, your breath
will get the job done...</i>

489
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:15.271
<i>...because you definitely need some
tic tacs, because your breath stinks!</i>

490
01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:19.901
<i>Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose. Just like the time...</i>

491
01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:25.031
You're not so good with people anymore,
are you?

492
01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.997
Thank you for my leg.

493
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.251
Okay.

494
01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:41.881
Where have you been?

495
01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:45.676
I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship
out of São Paulo.

496
01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:48.930
Those boats
weren't meant to be permanent.

497
01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:50.681
No, they weren't.

498
01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:53.851
When the Navy fell apart,
we started docking to take on supplies.

499
01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:57.772
Someone picked it up on shore.
Five of us were immune.

500
01:11:57.939 --> 01:11:59.607
You said five?

501
01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:02.652
The Darkseekers got them.

502
01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:07.657
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

503
01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:17.875
It's too late today.

504
01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:21.170
If we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can
make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

505
01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.798
-So if you had--
-I'm not leaving.

506
01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:27.009
This is ground zero.

507
01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:30.596
This is my site.

508
01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:34.767
I'm not gonna let this happen.

509
01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:39.230
I can still fix this.

510
01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:56.706
-Whoa. You scared me.
-Sorry.

511
01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.207
I called down twice.

512
01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:01.043
Oh. Oh, thank you.

513
01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:09.302
It's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.

514
01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:12.221
I've never seen one so still.

515
01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.516
They're always biting.

516
01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.856
You think that can cure her?

517
01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:24.984
Um... No, this will
almost certainly kill it...

518
01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:28.362
...but it's possible by drastically reducing
the body temperature...

519
01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:31.532
...I can increase the compound's
effectiveness.

520
01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:45.129
Did all of them die?

521
01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:46.923
Yes.

522
01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:52.011
My God.

523
01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:56.557
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.

524
01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:04.231
Where can Ethan sleep?

525
01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.794
He's heavy.

526
01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.094
Can you get that?

527
01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.211
She's beautiful.

528
01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.588
What's her name?

529
01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:13.175
Marley.

530
01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:18.014
-Her name was Marley.
-It's a beautiful name.

531
01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:23.936
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.

532
01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:27.440
-Who?
-Uh, the singer.

533
01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:30.234
Damian?

534
01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:33.529
Uh, his father.

535
01:15:36.782 --> 01:15:39.076
His father.

536
01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:41.287
Nope.

537
01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:43.539
<i>I shot the sheriff</i>

538
01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:49.795
<i>But I didn't shoot the deputy</i>

539
01:15:57.303 --> 01:16:02.349
-Oh, that is unacceptable.
-What?

540
01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:09.482
Best album ever made.

541
01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:21.911
-You don't recognize that?
-Mm-mm.

542
01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:24.455
Wow.

543
01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:32.171
He had this idea,
it was kind of a virologist's idea.

544
01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:37.009
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate. Literally cure it...

545
01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:43.307
...by injecting music and love
into people's lives.

546
01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:48.020
One day, he was scheduled
to perform at a peace rally.

547
01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:52.149
Gunmen came to his house
and shot him down.

548
01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:55.319
Two days later...

549
01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:59.573
...he walked out on that stage and sang.

550
01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:03.786
Somebody asked him why.

551
01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:08.040
He said, "The people...

552
01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:13.295
...who are trying to make this world worse
are not taking a day off.

553
01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.465
How can I?"

554
01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:22.388
Light up the darkness.

555
01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:50.624
Come with us, Neville.

556
01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:53.252
To the colony.

557
01:17:56.922 --> 01:17:59.383
There's no colony, Anna.

558
01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.222
Everything just fell apart.

559
01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:09.101
-There was no evacuation plan--
-You're wrong. There is a colony.

560
01:18:09.643 --> 01:18:11.687
I know, okay?

561
01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:14.356
How do you know, Anna?

562
01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:21.947
I just know.

563
01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:28.329
How? I said, how do you know?
How could you know?

564
01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:31.373
God told me.

565
01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:33.876
He has a plan.

566
01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:38.214
-God told you?
-Yes.

567
01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:41.133
-The God?
-Yes.

568
01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:45.137
-I know how this sounds.
-It sounds crazy.

569
01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:49.099
But something told me
to turn on the radio.

570
01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:50.893
Something told me to come here.

571
01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.854
My voice on the radio
told you to come here, Anna.

572
01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:56.065
You were trying to kill yourself
last night?

573
01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:57.233
Anna.

574
01:18:57.399 --> 01:19:00.569
I got here just in time to save your life.
That's a coincidence?

575
01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:04.365
-Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
-He must have sent me here for a reason.

576
01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:08.577
Neville, the world is quieter now.

577
01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:10.829
You just have to listen.

578
01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:13.165
If we listen...

579
01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:15.793
...we can hear God's plan.

580
01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:18.003
-God's plan?
-Yeah.

581
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.756
All right. Let me tell you
about your God's plan.

582
01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:23.842
There were 6 billion people on Earth
when the infection hit.

583
01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:28.597
KV had a 90 percent kill rate.
That's 5.4 billion...

584
01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.225
...people dead.

585
01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:34.228
Crashed and bled out, dead.

586
01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:36.272
Less than 1 percent immunity.

587
01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:40.234
That left 12 million healthy people
like you, me and Ethan.

588
01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:44.530
The other 588 million...

589
01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:46.699
...turned into your Darkseekers.

590
01:19:46.865 --> 01:19:48.575
And then they got hungry.

591
01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:53.163
And they killed and fed on everybody.

592
01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:56.417
Everybody!

593
01:19:57.126 --> 01:20:02.089
Every single person
that you or I has ever known...

594
01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:04.216
...is dead!

595
01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:08.429
Dead!

596
01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:12.516
There is no God. There is no God.

597
01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.648
What is that?

598
01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:26.322
Was it still dark when you
brought us home last night?

599
01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:29.575
You were bleeding.
There was light on the horizon.

600
01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.912
Turn the light off. Turn it off.

601
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:42.588
They followed us home.

602
01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:44.423
Ethan.

603
01:21:30.636 --> 01:21:32.304
Shit.

604
01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:46.652
Anna.

605
01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:49.988
Anna.

606
01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.370
Anna!

607
01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:09.925
Anna!

608
01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:14.930
Anna!

609
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:02.996
Anna?

610
01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:08.710
Anna.

611
01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.770
Come on. Come on.

612
01:25:09.813 --> 01:25:11.773
-Are you okay? You all right?
-Yeah.

613
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.483
Are you all right?

614
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:16.236
-You okay?
-Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

615
01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:32.502
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!

616
01:25:32.753 --> 01:25:35.547
Get to the lab! To the lab!

617
01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:45.932
Get behind the Plexi.

618
01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:48.435
Oh, my God. Come on.

619
01:26:01.031 --> 01:26:02.783
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

620
01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:06.370
Oh, my God.

621
01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.842
It's working.

622
01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.556
Neville...

623
01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:29.643
...it's working.

624
01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.775
No! Stop! Stop!

625
01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:40.362
Look, look, look, I can save you.

626
01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:43.990
I can sa-- I can help you.
You are sick and I can help you.

627
01:26:47.119 --> 01:26:49.079
I can-- I can fix this!

628
01:26:49.246 --> 01:26:50.789
I can save everybody!

629
01:26:50.956 --> 01:26:54.167
I can fix everything! It's working.
It's working!

630
01:26:57.421 --> 01:26:58.839
Stop! Stop!

631
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:08.432
Let me save you! Let me save you!

632
01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:09.599
No, no!

633
01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:21.737
No, no!

634
01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:40.881
<i>Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.</i>

635
01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:08.617
Robert.

636
01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:11.661
-What are you doing?
-The cure is in her blood.

637
01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:18.668
Coal chute. I think it'll be safe.
Ethan, get in!

638
01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:20.420
-Go.
-Come on, get in.

639
01:28:20.587 --> 01:28:22.464
-Get in.
-Anna.

640
01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:28.553
I think this is why you're here.

641
01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.350
What are you doing?

642
01:28:33.517 --> 01:28:35.560
I'm listening.

643
01:28:36.186 --> 01:28:38.021
-Neville, there's room. Come!
-No.

644
01:28:38.188 --> 01:28:41.149
They're not gonna stop.
They're not gonna stop.

645
01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:45.403
Stay in till dawn.

646
01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:08.672
<i>In 2009, a deadly virus
burned through our civilization...</i>

647
01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:12.092
<i>...pushing humankind
to the edge of extinction.</i>

648
01:31:12.258 --> 01:31:15.220
<i>Dr. Robert Neville dedicated his life...</i>

649
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:17.722
<i>...to the discovery of a cure...</i>

650
01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:20.642
<i>...and the restoration of humanity.</i>

651

<i>...at approximately 8:49 pm...</i>

653
01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:29.109
<i>...he discovered that cure.</i>

654
01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:35.573
<i>And at 8:52, he gave his life to defend it.</i>

656
01:31:39.285 --> 01:31:42.664
